<p>社評</p>
<h3>美日兩國的對比</h3>
<p>昨有海外二電訊，可以取爲甚饒趣味的對比；其一，華盛頓電，前與羅斯福總統競選失敗的共和黨候選人威爾基，昨日宣稱渠贊成羅斯福的援助民治國法案；又稱在目前情勢之下，國會應以特大之權力，授予總統；又稱渠將前往英國，旣得國務卿赫爾的准許。其二，東京電，銷路頗廣的某日本雜誌，近以「君知新機構意義乎」爲問題，徵求讀者答復，而大多數人答稱不知新機構是何合義；原來商人方面的對此茫無所知，自非意外，乃大多數人之中却包括了公務員敎員學生諸色人等；該雜誌認此爲極堪注意的事實云。就這兩電的本身內容而論，眞可謂風馬牛不相及也；但是根據這兩電而向美日兩國的政本國本，試加摸索，則對於潮流之中的一個大問題，獲得了新鮮而切實的資料。</p>
<p>德意志與義大利兩國，在它現行的法律上政制上事實上，皆是十足的極權國家。至於日本，雖在它的憲法上自始不能視爲正常的民治政體，然數十年來的運用，步趨英國，頗有成就；其國會與政黨的議政決策，蔚爲政治源泉所自，權威所寄，倘使恪守規模、循序演進，自應列之民治之林；及至十年前九一八的無端啓釁，終至成爲對華不宣而戰之局，其間又屢决搬演政治性的慘劇，於是它政治的源泉與權威，事實上轉移入於軍人掌握；去夏近衛重任閣揆，以新機構爲號召，多所更張，於是軍人當權的局面更進一步而漸入一法理化」「政制化」的堦段；現在正是一個尚未十分成熟的極權國家，並且向此標本而憧憬着，努力着，以冀及早成熟。從某一角度來檢定德義日三極權國家的根本意識，得以其褪色了的針對蘇聯而締結之反共公的爲徵象；然在現階段之中的事理上，所謂極權國家却與民治國家成爲鮮明的對立。十年以來，極權諸國一面以其獨有的邏輯來宣揚其極權的政制與理論，而以嘲笑民治爲反面的資料；一面以其暴力實行侵略，由侵略的進展來強調其極權的政本與理論，而民治國際（？）的種種「不爭氣」，復予以或零或躉的絕好資料。政治原是事實而不是理論，故民治雖爲一世紀以來絕大多數的人類所宗奉，且在理論上與各國政制上皆說明了民治應爲現代國家正常的國本政本所繫；乃事實上遭受了十年來的激盪，遂致民治與極權儼然有此消彼長之觀。對此消長，在宗奉民治的人們，祇有苦笑，且感威脅。歐戰到去年夏間，法國大敗而潰而降，德國獲得了，近於超越智慧所能想像的勝利；那時候，酷似竟有一個政治教室，極權先生鞭答民治學生，幷且敎訓學生們：這是真理！</p>
<p>「政治原是事實而不是理論」，民治眞理可以昭垂千古，而十年來的事實却造反了，幾乎使民治不但不再能高踞真理的寶座，現實的民治且將為之動搖，甚或為之顚覆：事實與理論既離異之甚，幾乎使大多數人類棲棲遑遑，不知所安。然而眞理畢竟是眞理，凡百變態必有事實的限度，凡是眞理終有事實爲說明。瘋在變態之後，便有事實如斯：法國敗而英國不敗，可見民治國家非必敗：德國強而義國不強，可見極權國家非必強；這至少斷言於國家的強弱勝敗與民治極權無關，至少破除了極權的迷信。真理之下的事實還不祗此。在日本：傾其全國之師，數十年之積蓄，對中國不宣而戰，而其全國人民殆找不到一句愜心貴當的話來表示他們所真能承認的對華作戰之意義與目的，除非是話匣中所稱的新秩序。近衛得軍人撑腰，大權在握，傾其全力造所謂新機構；最近乃由某雜誌暴露了日本智識階級乃至大多數人對於新機構的茫然不解。這些事實，或可解釋爲極權政制本以民可使由，不可使知爲精神；然極權所吹聽的訓練全民，使之理解，使之心悅誠服而全國一致協力，這是給某雜誌吹破了。反觀民治的氣象如何？美國在民治之下，是兩黨對立的，現行政策與現任總統是以民主黨為基礎的：而共和黨競選總統失敗了的威爾基，却坦然擁護其政敵所定的國策，主張其政敵獲得更大的權力，而其出國遠行亦樂於先徵其政敵的同意。這種氣象，眞不知道極權如德義所以不容多黨存在而必一黨一黨人，極權的理由安在？不知道極權如日本所以務使各黨毀滅而標榜無黨爲治的理由又安在？反之，全民理解，全民協力的事實，却不在極權的日本而在民治的美國！可以使由不可使知的國家究得造就何種程度的力量，全民理解全民協力的國家又得造就何種程度的力量，二者對比，可以斷言所成就的終必懸殊霄壞。而美國全國成爲一個兵工廠，成爲反侵略各民治國兵工廠，在目前具見其可能，在他日具見其事實，這便是事實與理論的合轍，便是民治的眞理！</p>

<h3>李希使法與野村使美</h3>
<p>美國新任駐法大使李希與日本新任駐美大使野村，都是海軍上將，這是國際外交史上罕見的巧合，具有特別深長的意義茲，將紐約泰晤士報的紀載，譯錄如次：</p>
<p>羅斯福總統調任波多里哥島總督李希海軍上將爲駐法大使的消息，最初是總統的秘書哈塞特向報界發表的。他對於這事雖不願張大共詞，但曾謂李希上將具有多年的海軍經騐，長於防禦戰略，深爲總統所器重。他任海軍參謀長的時候，尤爲總統所倚　。</p>
<p>羅期福總統這次物色駐法大使，在先原以陸軍名宿潘興將軍，在上次歐戰時，現任法國元首貝當上將，十分親睦，因曾屬意於他，但潘興將軍遵照醫師的勸告，已婉辭謝絕，總統始乃改派李希出任艱鉅</p>
<p>自歐戰爆發以來，美國駐歐洲各國大使，除駐蘇聯大使史丹赫特外，多已先後返國。李希到任後，因將成爲美國大使在歐洲活動的第二人。（按美國駐義大利大使費利浦最近亦已啟程返任。）</p>
<p>李希上將原是美國大海軍主義派的中堅份子，在羅斯福總統實行海軍擴充計劃時，曾與之密切合作。一般人鑒於法屬菲洲各港口的最後命運如何，地中海的局勢如何，法國艦隊如何處置，均不可測，故信李希上將，以其經騐和威望出任駐法大使一職，實是最爲適當的了。據華盛頓官方評論，李希上將足以增强法國的勇氣，並足以防止該國的殖民地的瓦解。</p>
<p>美國對於法國在大西洋和太平洋兩方面的屬地，即中美洲加勒賓海的馬爾蒂尼克島，西菲洲沿岸的達伽爾港，及遠東方面越南的命運，都感到重大的關係。各該屬地主權若果移交德義兩國，或聽由它們充分利用，足以威脅美國的安全。李希上將並當鼓勵維希政府，加强支持越南當局，抵抗日本海陸軍的侵略。</p>
<p>總之，美國任命駐法大使，是迫於國外種種事變而採取的一種有力舉動。法國人民處此創痰滿目的今日，觀於此舉，亦可知美國的友誼，並不是反覆無常的，在急難之中，實是靠得住的。他們並可自知戰敗的法國並不孤立，美國決不拋棄他們，聽任德國任意擺佈。</p>
<p>講到日本政府派遣前任外相野村海軍大將爲駐美大使，當此消息公佈之後，東京一部份美國僑民原已定妥回國船票的都向輪船公司退票，展緩行期。據日本報上所說，松岡外相遴選這位大使，已緩和了美日兩國當前的危機了。實則野村在危急之秋膺命出馬，雖可謂適合時機，但恐怕除掉延宕時日，不願立刻和美國「看底牌」而外，沒有甚麽用處罷！</p>
<p>至於野村對美的策略，可以從他在外相任內推行的政策中，窺見一斑。當時他曾擬定一種計劃，想把美國人民在此次中日戰爭中所受的損害，一經查明，立即設法予以解決，藉此緩和美日兩國的緊張關係。不過問題所在，這種緩和一九三九年緊張局勢的辦法，是吾可以挽救一九四〇年以後的局勢。目前危機，並非僅僅因美國人在戰爭中蒙受損害而發生的，其重要關鍵，却在日本與德國締結軍事同盟條約，美國人相信這種條約實係恫嚇美國的一種企圖。</p>
<p>美國人這種觀察，並非對於該約條文有何誤解所致，實是日本首相近衛和外相松岡咄咄逼人的演說所促成。近衛曾說，「太平洋的和戰問題，將視日本人或美國人能否諒解並尊重對方的立塲，以爲轉移。」他並忠告美國說，「日德義三國正在建設一種世界新秩序，並使其合於新世界潮流，美國務須加以考慮和諒解。倘使美國不能諒解日本的眞正意向，那末除了出於一戰之外，別無他途。」兩天之後，他又說日本人應該「準備應付最惡劣的局勢。」</p>
<p>外相松岡也向各國聲明，「倘使各國願意將所受損害，减少至最低限度，務須放棄一切援助重慶政府的舉動。」</p>
<p>那知這些忠告的結果，適得其反。英國政府既宣佈重行開放滇緬公路，美國政府即於同時勸告遠東僑民撤退，加拿大繼之禁銅運往日本，而美國海軍後備隊四千二百員名亦即跟着開往太平洋各海軍根據地，加入艦隊服役了。</p>
<p>英美兩國既然表示準「看底牌，」日本却似乎還沒有此種決心。退一步言，吾人即使承認近衛和松岡的言論，是由於誤解美國興情所致，並承　野村的出使美國是日本　　初衷的暗示，然而日美兩國芥蒂的根本原因却並未因此消失</p>
<p>日本迫於環境，企圖屆時向蘇聯和美國推行緩和政策。野村大將的出使美國和建川中將的出使蘇聯，就是日木努力避免陷於孤立的兩種姿態，另一方面却又强化日德同盟，錯估了這種同盟對於美國的影響，以爲美國能够雌　，結果却惹起了美國興情的憤怒，當非始料所及吧。</p>

<p>易籃再戰、雙方仍以原陣角逐、華星因前半勝來過易、防守未如前半嚴密、不意陣脚一鬆、被速增七分、比數被追成十九比廿二、相差僅祇三分、從此一面倒之局勢、已一變而爲驚濤駭浪之塲面、比包松圓射中、曼恩又照樣報復廿一比廿四之際、因發生武劇、暫見停頓、戰端再揭、麥軍氣燄愈熾、自鴻斌一罰、震中一射、美軍會追成廿五比廿七、及廿七比廿九之兩次接近局面、迨曼恩一射、成各廿九平等、局勢更見緊張、未幾尼古拉罰中、麥軍已以三十比廿九後來居上、其時距終塲尙有六分鐘、形勢愈趨嚴重、而尼古拉落井下石、更來一决、籃下托中、卅二比廿後以後、華星不免慌亂、鴻斌震中、三射三失、幸而包松圓連中兩鵠、始以卅二比卅二、獲得最後勝利、麥令二次敗北、</p>

<h3>糧食　米糧投機稍歛迹　米價立小去四五元</h3>
<p>一號西貢開八十三四元　洋米續到一萬八千餘包</p>
<p>米市自本月份大批期貨絡釋到逹、人心惴惴、突將把持各貨、爭相脫出、在貨旺銷弱之環境下、迭見回跌、昨日假後復業、更以來源愈旺、賣方售意益鬆、市貨充斥、競脫不已、銷塲則以投機交易絕跡、端賴本鄉店胃一些實銷、去路平正、交易有限、頓呈供過於求、而賣方昔則一味居奇、茲因國外定價通劃、來源絡繹不絕、且定貨先後成交達六七十萬包之鉅、在此年終結束、不得不羣相求脫、誠恐市面難以支持、備受損失、故浮戶貶價、洋商廉售允使市而遭受鉅大之反動、開市後一路直瀉、以迄收盤、較之週前行情、均見暴跌三四五元不等、計一號西貢已祗八十四五元一至八十三元半、二號七十九元、一决至七十七元、一號陳暹邏八一十五元、新八十三元、二號七十六七元、火絞八十三元、次至八十元、小紋七十一元半、七十一元、下午至七十元、米菉六十七元、碎尖六十四元、次至五十六</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米去路雖亦不暢、但以到貨有限、致市面較易支持、跌風不若洋米之烈、僅貶一二元、若崑山斛見白粳一百元至九十七元、無錫特粳一百零二元、靑角斛見薄稻九十七元半九十七元、原包一百零一元、</p>
<p>糯米依然冷落異常、成交既屬寥寥、而貨主亦無意急脫、故形勢雖疲、行情仍無所變化、宜溧白元開九十一二元、香港白元高自八十元零三角次至七十七元、</p>
<p>洋米來源旺盛、太古公司安順輪前日（十二日）到埠由香港裝來五千二百三十九包、又該公司漢陽輪昨日到滬亦由香港裝來一萬三千四百九十四包、兩輪共裝來一萬八千七百三十三包之多、今日有苞米九千三百包運烟台、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市下游因素　來源不斷售出多</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨粉市、再趨下游、查洋粉在市塲供應、業已逐見衆多、而銷塲方面、本客均乏暢胃、本街平賣粉雖屬不敷、而所缺數額、殊屬無幾、更兼米市銳跌、入心莫不軟化、一般執貨者、紛紛求售、而進戶寥落、統市僅開花烏鐘樓牌澳粉二三千包、價二十三元八角至七角、及新由香港運到之麥花牌洋粉一千五百包、價二十二元六角、後市局勢更疲、價格再低一二角不等、本廠粉仍爲二十一元五角、由兩廠供給四千包左右、</p>
<p>洋粉　仍有接連來滬、太古公司安順·漢陽·兩輪、除裝來大量洋米外、又由香港裝來麵粉甚多、計安順輪裝來二千包、漢陽輪裝來五千包、共計七千包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市况、並無特殊進出、蓋以目下存到兩少、各粉廠欲購不易、惟粉價下游聲中、進胃亦無形怠懈、聞日廠門市收價仍爲三十一元、僅收進二三百包、市塲交易、概無所聞、</p>
<h3>金融　外商收進英金　意興較為濃厚</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、初狀略現鬆態、本月份美滙一度成交五元五六二五、後以洋行結納、遂告回平、惟外銀行對先令均俱納胃、本日由滙豐給予十餘萬鎊、然價格終微軟化、後市美滙雖投機商力扒、因外銀行肯塞、價仍穏定、收盤英軟〇一五六二五、美則平定、計英滙三辦士四八四三七五、美滙五元五三一二五、</p>
<p>洋行略有結款</p>
<p>晨初以滙兌英對美滬法等均平、美對英滬等亦平、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士半，美滙五元五三一二五、與週六午收價無異、開後滙豐先售予有利現貨先令價爲三辦士半、而有利賣出本月份美滙價稍硬化、計日商銀行吸入爲五元五六二五、九時半滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀稅亦平、此後突聞洋行略有結款、需要較殷、潛勢告平、計洋行扒入本月份美滙五元五三一二五、又下月份五元半、迨至午刻變化甚少、而英金以外行買進較有興趣、價呈微軟、午收價現貨爲三辦士四八四三七五、美滙仍五元五三一二五、</p>
<p>美匯屹然不動</p>
<p>後市外行屹入先令頗夥、聞均係滙豐賣出、計現貨價爲三辦士半、數的十萬鎊、而投機商來扒二月份美滙、以外銀行肯售、爲狀屹然不動、計投機商進外行爲五元半、晚收現貨及本月份英金三辦士四八四三七五、美滙五元五三一二五、下月份英金三辦士四六八七五、美滙五元半、較上週末、英金期現微緊〇一五六二五、美滙榮辱不分、</p>

<h3>外幣徵堅</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋略漲、英美金鎊故亦各升一元、英金票仍呆定、美金票始曾退至十七元九角一分、卒爲十八元零二分、比上週六軋升六分、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票稍有供給、市價略軟、晚市爲一元五角九分半、朝鮮票供求相埒、晚市仍站一元一角九分、</p>
<h3>金市潛勢仍堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、由跌轉漲、六千四百元大關退入後瞬即回出、各方人心爲謠諑所激動、且外滙常露軟態、但因今天午後一時至二時爲一月份轉入二月份掉期日、聞由買方貼出予賣方竟須八十元左右、未免影響買勢、故在同康賣康公和義豐新豐大德成買勢下、有祥和一利德孚銀號幫之吐售、故價雖由六千三百七十元步升至六千四百四十五元、中途多盤、均漲勢不久即回、終小退至六千四百二十五元、軋升二十二元、照美滙一月期晚收五元五三一二五結價、仍六千三百十六元、計抬一百〇九元、全日交易共七八千兩、現金上午初由金號售予小錢莊五十兩、及銀樓二十兩、價與期交價同、後立康出大德成二十兩、低二元、下午低叫元有賣戶、飾金升十元、達六百六十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤先疲後回堅</p>
<p>晨初以滙市開出滙豐及其他英行供塞先令、美滙價呈硬化、檯面買聲殊弱、開盤較上週六收低三元、爲六千四百元、不久聞新空戶羣起拋售、於是退入四百元關內、計銀號出金號二十兩、告六千三百七十元、後因滙市走勢吿定、小錢莊證券幫等紛紛來購、價乃漸漸向上、未幾錢兌業進銀號二十兩、已挺至六千四百四十元、而金銀號斯時又塞、復下挫數十元、計銀號對做二十兩、告六千四百十元、但相近午刻、外滙微微轉軟、滙票商撈進甚速、金號跟買若干、勢頗堅穏、計銀號入證券幫二十兩、六千四百三十五元惟收盤時浮戶有售、結果告六千四百三十五元收盤、收後塲外聞曾回好至六千四百三十五元、午後開盤買氣尙旺、計銀號互做十兩、爲六千四百四十元、且一霎時賣戶裹足、續漲五元、計銀號入證券幫二十兩、爲六千四百四十五元、嗣聞滙市因滙豐肯塞而平、證券幫曁銀號一致轉售、撳至六千四百十五元、至晚收結果、散戶略吸、終告六千四百二十五元、比上星期六收軋升二十二元、全日上落七十五元、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價大同行新同行等上午十點一刻、應六百六十元、以後未更、收進减低三十元云、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債回漲</h3>
<p>昨日統一公債暗盤况、兎起　落、伸縮於三五角至八九角之間、當晨初做開、首以消息平淡、買賣沿稱相埒、故市態徘徊、堅勢未銳、乃人後、突傳有利多空氣、人心頓見篷勃、大戶爭先吸收、空方亦多拋出、是以塲中傾軋激烈、各債未能直棧而上、午後依然盤旋、脚地似更堅穩、葉某大戶收購不怠、且有浮空之抵補、以致檀面籌碼緊縮、乃有求過於供之象、各債起伏結果、一致軋漲四角半至六角不等、九六亦帶好一角五分、全日買賣、以樂茂恒孚敦餘同康姓昶順泰仁昌九成等吸收最多、而供者爲鴻大信孚四十一號新華鴻大聯和等居多、全日綜計成交約三百七十餘萬元、</p>
<p>股票交易、閘北水電成交、五百股、價為九元一角、衆業股市開盤堅挺非凡、獲利了結者雖衆、買方吸方收能力頗强、實　股有數種發現新高價、橡皮股比較被人忽視、</p>
<h3>各橡皮股派息</h3>

<h3>廿九年呢絨業之陳跡（續）</h3>
<p>— 浮石生</p>
<p>（一）業外人握有大批法幣者俱、抱團貨爲實在安定之策、（二）定到絕無僅有、貨底缺乏、然大部份、則仍照六七月份爲便宜也、營業方面、雖交易額悉較往年爲大、而實際上則已减遜、因前貨價低、現在貨價吃本大、其理極明、因日方統制加緊、呢羢出口、俱須打「搬出證」及「搬入證」、客運更轉艱難、外埠鬧貨荒、如南京寗波地方、呢絨行情、與申相較、平均相差四分細以至一二倍不等、於是交通稍便如南京、一般往返做單　等、大見增夥、其商情趨勢之外、太季中發生意外特訊、較之往年爲夥、並因百物漲無止境、生活程度高升、薪水階級莫不大感痛苦、染坊工人罷工、繼之者有四馬路大新街西服騙工瀉工、不日霞飛路紅　裁縫罷工、通後有南京路靜安寺路四川路西服工人罷工、其結果不出爲工資增加、三元以下加七成、四兀以上加六成、五元以上加五成、六元以上加四成、繼之者石路衣莊幫罷工、究之呢絨購買力、莫比上半年爲减退、高等顧客漸多成爲中等、中等顧客轉購下檔貨、以致下檔十·二十元一碼及三·四元一尺呢絨、出路驟形活躍、爲迎合顧客之心理、申地紡織本廠貨、產銷特別旺盛、其毛缺棉多之充貨、如防雨布·充鞋呢·假直貫·棉駝絨等、充斥於市、茲將二十九年四季呢羢貨價、彙刋於后、</p>
<p>（註）……代表落令無市　單位法幣元　每碼現批市價　（完）</p>
<h3>紗花　買紗望漲　—人心愈挺拔—</h3>
<p>紗市大堅、且漲風復起、此因盤旋多日大概形勢、向下程度暫可一停、於是投機者索性向上做、由此你買我進、檯面一緊、市價即當上升、同時香港幫對於廉價之二三支紗稍爲收進幾包、人心愈挺矣、但雜色紗仍較雙馬便宜百五十元外、有一部份已經收貿、故趨勢亦昂、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百〇二元、低價爲一千三百六十六元、午後做至一千四百〇七八元、繼後爲一千四百〇二元、有人賣出、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、氣勢尚　和平、人心仍定、首盤價為一千三百七十二元、漸後逐步跌至一千三百六十六元、但價格一低、市塲謠諑突熾、爲某某消息利於多頭、然外匯依然寗靜、惟買者猶似蜂擁而來、市盤乃立刻前進、且漲力殊强、直出一千四百元關外、中途盈利者了結、又進四百元內、爲一千三百九十五元、收盤價爲一千三百九十九元、查半日間成交統針六千〇四十五包、行情廿支雙馬漲二十九元、又棉紗今有一百三十三件、運往香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、同行五、四〇〇香港　五七〇寗波　七五統計六、〇四五</p>
<h3>廠方有進現棉　市面稍好一步</h3>
<p>現棉情况略堅、良以申新二九廠近日開出棉紗殊巨、對於原料稍有補價、所以成交較夥、行情堅挺一步、不過海外訂價印棉甚廉也、米特林價爲三百十六元、惠司登價爲二百五十六元、巴西棉價爲三百元、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因同業之購買、續後則因華爾街之賣出、後一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落二四磅音、印度速同預測降落二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來則因紗價之高漲、棉市亦轉呈活潑之狀、奈因廠方納胃較星呆滯、故未聞有大量交易之做開也、然零星交易則尙稱熱閙也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布漲風　再接再厲</h3>
<p>廠布昨市趨勢益堅、業內外囤戶心思交易旺盛，有再接再厲之勢、客幫以市面俏俐、亦亟起購辦、故交易紛沓、售盤一致提高、粗細布斜紋晨開即漲每疋十角半、後市續漲二角半至五角、漂染布亦漲每疋五角之譜、本街成交各布近千件、浙皖贛幫辦色布粗細布二百餘件、粵港幫辦漂染布粗布斜紋等三百餘件、北路烟津幫辦色布重磅粗布一百數十件、國外新加坡等地辦漂布色斜卡其等六千數百疋、十四日有疋頭二百件、運烟台、又六十件、運天津、</p>
<p>東布漲風甚熾、蓋以各方種多空氣轉盛、業內外購買益旺、步步升騰、十二磅龍頭細布最高盤到四十三元七角、收盤時略回至四十三元五角半、較上週漲每疋一元一角半、四君子嗶嘰新單一元二角四分半、老單一元二角〇五厘，</p>
<h3>油餅　油市投機　躍躍欲試　青島桶裝生油　一三五元七五</h3>
<p>食油來源、邇又被某方故弄虛玄、致到貨突見轉滯、雖銷路並不暢旺、但一部油市投機、莫不躍躍欲試、因此行情在不知不覺中步向新高峰邁進、昨日靑島桶裝生油竟創一百三十五元七角半空前紀錄、比前銳升三元其餘亦各漲一二元、計售開靑島生油一百三十桶、江北生油二百聽、烟聽生油一百三十聽、烟台生油一百件、膠州生油五十件、又二月上期交一百件、大潮豆油二百桶、又二月上期交三百桶、大有廠豆油四百担、靑岐豆油五十件、膠州豆油四十件、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平定</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、上落甚微、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧初爲七十八元三角、後仍回至七十八元半、無上落、二月十日打單七十九元一角至三五角、荷赤現貨六十五元至六十五元一角、及三角、小三角、太古車白B嘜七十八元八角、不動、HX嘜七十六元八角、</p>
<h3>呢絨　呢絨業大得利</h3>
<p>—近來交易大熱鬧—</p>
<p>歷年呢絨至此時候、行情轉平、交易轉淡、忙於盤貨收賬、預備渡歲總結束、今庚則大不相同、進出多現鈔、少放賬、大多數亦改國曆結賬、大小各號、二十九年份、莫不大有盈餘、爲有呢絨業以來所罕見、手頭實裕、加以貨底缺乏、反而互相搜羅、囤存貨物、故呢絨交易特別鬧忙矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜漲風大熾</h3>
<p>金針菜因存底日稀、市勢日見緊俏、逐步上漲、昨日號盤漲風大熾、頂莊菜開至一百四十元、升十三元、以次爲一百二十八元至一百二十五元、普通一百十元、如春市去路加暢、尙看續升、</p>

<h3>英商電車又將加價　各界盼取消原議　攸關全市各業工作效率　大部分市民無負擔力量　實行期尚有待盼當局複議收回成命</h3>
<p>本埠公共租界上海英商電車公司、自以外匯緊縮開支驟增爲理由、呈請工部局要求對車資再行增加百分之三十五後、此一要求、已於八日工部局董事會予以通過、並決定於本月二十六日起、在公共租界區域內各路有軌無軌電車一律實行、</p>
<p>當局通過　全市扼腕</p>
<p>本市居民、自獲悉是項消息後、對工部局通過是項耍求、深爲扼腕、蓋本埠自去年入秋以來、百物即逐月騰漲、迄十二月已達最高峯、頗予市民以嚴重威脅、今年自元旦起、物價未見傾跌、因此平民生活、仍感覺極度困難、而電車汽車向爲公甩事業之主要部門、與整個商業之繁榮及市民福利、全市員工工作效率、均有密切之聯繫、</p>
<p>一再加價　有背原理</p>
<p>况在去年九月間、車資已增加一次、迄今爲日無幾、又以再度加價聞、實有違背公用事業之主旨、查上海自畸形發展後、人口驟增、幾達一倍、各項營業、雖呈外强中乾現象、惟各種交通工具、則十分發達、營業之興盛、遠非事變前可比、</p>
<p>薪給階級　力難負荷</p>
<p>故盈餘數量、殊足驚人、且公司所用原料、大部訂於數年前者、今價格雖漲、不過其中之一部份、實非含有「絕對」性也、本埠各界人土對此次加價問題、以逾實行期、尙有旬日、大有餘暇、足資複議、更希當局在此時此地、體念市民苦衷、予以收回加價成命、蓋電車最大主顧、全係中下層之薪水階級、月入微薄、平時節衣縮食、尙不能渡一家之溫飽、今再突然增加支出、殊爲事實所不許也、</p>
<h3>英大使夫人　昨日赴港</h3>
<p>英駐華大使寇爾爵士夫人、及沙遜洋行主人沙遜爵士、昨乘渣華郵船公司新郵船芝渣連加號離滬赴香港、聞本市洋商銀行鉅子多人亦搭芝楂連加號郵船赴港、</p>
<h3>法大使延期返滬　奉命赴越　與泰越衝突有關　衆信任務極重要</h3>
<p>法大使戈斯默、自上年年底由渝抵港後、原定計劃、即行離港回滬、茲據平明社記者向關係方面探悉、法大使於本月三日晚、突又變更行程、於是日深夜、忽忽乘輪離港赴河內、與越督彭古中將有所會晤、至河內後、並再前赴西貢方面、有所公幹、至返滬行期、一再延遲、據消息靈通之可恃方而所知、法大使此决突然改變行程、實由本月三日晚、接獲維希方面命令、着赴越南、觀是以戈氏當晚深夜離港、足證其任務之重要、衆信戈氏此行、與越泰衝突擴大之局勢有關、又據本埠法總領之關係方面稱、大使回滬確期、迄至昨日下午、尙無確實消息接到、故日內或難以返滬、並悉大使此次離渝時、曾偕共夫人及秘書同時抵港、</p>
<h3>當局對滬市金融　加强統制管理</h3>
<p>外滙黑市隨時維持平抑　各行莊營業須填表報核</p>
<p>上海金融市塲自經國家銀行與各友邦銀行、及銀錢業通力合作調整後、雖値此各業總結束期間、依然穏定、使投機者無法乘風興浪、操縱市塲、（一）外匯黑市經外匯平準基金委員會維持、儘量供給中外各業正當需要後、匯率法定始終不變、黑市站在天然水準、管理政策逐漸强化、其有助於金融之安定、實非淺鮮、（二）</p>

<p>國債因中國政府一再聲明維持債信、關稅擔保之各債、中中交農四行貼現付款、以致價格飛漲、創戰後新紀錄、中國股票因各業均獲盈餘各國貨工廠股票價格、超過票面額、（三）黃金等暗市因係非法組織、政府早經命令禁止、而依然買賣交易者、實與法令抵觸、所以黃金之在漲暴落與整個金融無關、（四）整個金融因國家銀行</p>
<p>辦理貼放</p>
<p>以及銀錢業準備會庫之調劑、新年各業開市後、愈趨穩定、洋拆低落、銀根鬆弛、本屆所表現之金融狀態、與上屆比較似較安定、關於法幣信用、因金融管理化、愈見堅强、雜鈔發行並不影響法幣信用、法幣價格黑市愈見提高、銀錢兩業同業公會、並奉財政部令、調查各行莊二十九年下半年度</p>
<p>存放利息</p>
<p>、包括（一）放款信用抵押、（二）存款定期活期、（三）貼現同業等、聞兩業公會已遵令附表飭會員行莊遵照辦理、並聞財政部對上海之游資、除獎勵內移外、正計劃妥善辦法、使是項游資得爲國用、勿使流入市塲、爲投機者操縱市面、同時對上海各投機市塲設法取締、使金融得以持久穏定、人民生活得以安定、</p>
<p>拒用雜鈔</p>
<p>大中社云、英文大美晚報云、一記者今晨（十三日）持某方所發行之雜鈔、試往購物、但本埠英法兩租界各店鋪均拒絕收用、即市上華商及英美各國銀行、亦均拒絕收受此項雜鈔、作為存款、其前途可想而知、某行開張之主要目的、人莫不知為發行「鈔票」、據稱、該「行」於六日成立後、至十一日止共發行「流通券」六百四十一萬三千九百二十七元二角、現金準備、不多不少、亦適與發行額恰相符合記老曾以此事之可能性、叩詢銀行界某君、據稱、自國府改革幣制以還、民間現銀、早經政府收兌、東南成績最佳、黃金已早經政府管理、所有金銀、於戰事未發生前、即由中央運往安全地帶、現在何來現金、若謂該行所有之準備爲外滙、則既未獲得外國借款、亦尙未能統制淪陷區域之貿易、（現爲華中日軍統制）更何來外匯、根據以上理由、法幣堅强、備受人民信仰、蓋亦有由來也、</p>
<h3>公倉管理會　昨日開始辦公　辦事處設於工部局三樓　坐辦一職推秦潤卿担任</h3>

<p>洋米昨均跌價</p>
<p>大中社記者昨向關係方面探悉、洋米產地如西貢暹邏仰光及運蝓樞紐之香港、昨已有電到滬報告、各檔米價均已下跌、致昨日本埠各檔洋米價格、每石猛跌三元上下、暹邏一號米每石由八十八元跌至八十五元、較八十九元之限價、已低落四元、西貢一號米每石由八十七元跌至八十四元、西貢一二號混合碎米之跌勢尤勁、昨日又繼續猛跌四元、故各種國米價格亦帶跌元餘、又悉昨日港米到滬、（一）安順輪六千七百包、（二）漢陽輪一萬三千四百九十四包、</p>
<p>抬高米價結果</p>
<p>前日星期五、有某米行售與楊樹浦平涼路某酒廠之糯米一百餘包、裝卡車四輛至該酒廠、正在卸貨之時、突來江北貧民一百餘人、手持小刀、將蔴袋割破、用預備之淘米籮及洋粉袋等搶取糯米、該酒廠及解米員工無法阻止、爰報告該管捕房、派中西探捕到塲彈壓、遂將該批貧民驅散、但已損失不貲、被刦去約達十餘石之多、此則純係米蠶抬高米價之因果也、</p>

<h3>撤消漸海「封鎖」　航商已提談判　預料兩星期內可獲結果　拖輪改駛長江下游各埠</h3>
<p>字林報云、本市船主代表、刻正與有關日當局從事談判、以期日方寬弛其對航業所施之限制、此項談判、若如此間若干航運界人士所預期者、能在短期內圓滿結束、則日海軍當局對附近沿海口岸所施封鎖、將撤消一部份、供應品即能運入若干華方管轄區、日當局既不惜代價、決心厲行禁航、乃有若干船主建議、</p>
<p>外商輪船租予日商</p>
<p>俾可賡續沿海貿易者、聞此種計劃、巳獲日商承租人之贊成、但所成問題者、爲日商承租之船、何能獲得許可、而駛入毘連華軍扼守地之水面、如溫州等是、爲克服此種困難起見、船主代表亦已進行磋商、據若干船主謂、磋商或有結果、此間航運界人士、昨（十二日）有預料商榷可於兩星期內結束者、聞此項談話、特別</p>
<p>以浙江各口岸為限</p>
<p>同時、懸各外國旗幟之拖輪、曾航行於中國沿海者、現改駛上海與長江下游及江蘇以外各地之間、諺云、「需要乃創造之母」沿海空業、已予以證明、綠日海軍當局自去歲七月實施禁航以還、一度繁榮之航業、一落千丈、船主雖力圖與日方獲取妥洽、但日方堅決續施禁止、致沿海航業有完全停頓之虞、船隻閒泊、船主與承租人損失不貲、故派船繞道行駛、甚至冒被扣之險、以賡續其服務者、頗不乏人、而船主所以</p>
<p>冒險派船航行原因</p>
<p>無非為前往溫州等口岸之運費高昂所動、許多船隻、一再企圖冒險、致有被日當局所扣、直至各該船主及領署代表與日當局磋商久之、始得開釋、日海軍當局近來乃發現有若干輪船、皆於夜間乘日方不備、駛入各口岸繫泊、連夜卸貨、日方乃派兵登深夜或淸晨駛入之若干船隻、並沒收船上所載全體貨物、始不復有冒此險者、自一個月前起、船主承租人或託運貨物者、告向日海軍當局繳付巨額「特別費」、始獲卸貨許多、惟此費遠較所獲之利爲巨、故許多船主、決定完全停航、</p>

<p>自由談自然自然界的囤積商（上）  劍農　　想不到的，由於近來喜讀自然科學書籍的緣故，却無意的發現了囤積商人的諸般色相，本來面目。現在先畫出他們簡單的輪廓來，然後用科學的事實證明它。我敢說：「所謂囤積商人者：其腹大，其皮厚，其手緊，其心毒，其性吝，其視短，其憑高作祟術可通神，故又渾身多刺，令人觸之棘手？然而……」然而二字以下，我本來要說出囤積商人的最後結果，不過，這種結果，雖說在下等動植物界已經成為鐵一般的事實，可是究竟能否拿來適用於我們這萬物之　的高等人類呢？我如今貿不敢然武斷，還是等待它自然演進到最後的事實來判明吧。不過（，又一個不過！）據日前報載，已竟有什麽從前的市長，因為囤積食糧的罪名……　　腹大　在南美洲巴西車巴　亞省的沙漢原野裏，有一種稀奇古怪的樹木，名叫Pavanillesia。這種樹高約六丈多，樹幹的兩端尖細，中部粗大，完全似一隻酒桶或花瓶。因為它處身在雨量稀少水泉缺乏的荒原上，所以不能不在雨季或地下深層中，儘量的吸取，囤積，以去持延長的旱季所需要的水分。久而久之，竟把樹身弄得膨脹臃腫到這步田地了！它的頭上頂着稀疎的幾個枝　，在下雨的季節，銷微長出幾個可憐的小葉來，天旱的時候便乾癟了，往後一毛不拔！同時在澳大利亞大陸上，有一種同上邊所說差不多的樹：法文名字叫Arbre-Boutcille，英文名字叫Bottle-tree，這真可譯作「甁子樹」了。我以為這兩種樹是便便大腹的囤積商人的普遍形態。　　皮厚　在磽　和沙漠不毛之地的植物，因為水量的稀少和珍貴。不能不設法把它囤積起來。囤積起來了，又怕它因為蒸發而喪失的迅速和過多，於是異想天開，把自己的皮膚變厚，叫它成為革質；還怕不十分妥當，又在外面漆上一種膠或臘的物質。這樣，它把水分蒸發的門戶完全閉塞，掛上「此路不通」的牌子，便能安然享受它的囤積品了。一個絕妙的例子，是南非洲喀刺哈里（Kalahari）沙漠中的一種名叫Welwitsehia　Mirabilis的植物。它的樹幹是木質，只有五寸高；沿着樹頭周圍開花，是圓硬的小紅球。它有兩個頭大無倫，比牛皮還堅韌的革質葉子，葉端分裂成許多長三尺上下的小皮帶。它就利用這刀劍砍割不破的厚皮，和鑠金流石的烈日炙手燙足的熱土相搏鬥！我以為這革質葉子彷彿囤積商人的而皮，任社會人士的笑罵和輿論的制裁，只給你來一個面孔一板充耳不聞，其奈我何？　　我們看到Welwitschia　　　lirolbilis的兩張革質而帶膠臘質的葉子，是把囤積的物品怎樣保存的惟周惟密不肯稍有隙漏啊！把這比作囤積商人至死不肯把貨物輕易放鬆的兩隻手，加上一個「緊」字的形容辭，應該不算過份吧。　　心毒　在昆虫中，有種最喜歡囤積，而且為我們最有利益的東西恐怕就是那採花釀蜜的蜜蜂了。牠們辛勤囤積的情形，是人所共知的，用不着浪費筆墨去描述，我現在只討論牠們的心毒。記得幼時讀左傳說：「蜂躉有毒，而况國乎？」以為所說的有毒，不過是指尾上的毒刺罷了。那想到研究了牠們生活的情形，而明瞭了牠們的心尤其狠毒。據湯姆生（Thomson）在科學大綱上，記載蜂羣因為囤積的緣故，怕到冬天不能獨亨其囤積品而殘殺同類的事情說：「……一旦不事事者不得食並不得生之命令發出，於是屠殺雄蜂之事乃開始：久歷艱難之職蜂，乃奮勇無情，盡殺諸雄蜂。」這樣說起來，蜂的心毒不毒呢？囤積商人，只顧本身的利益，任憑恒河沙數的同胞，因着自己的罪惡，飢餓凍餒而死，不但不稍生惻隱憐憫之心，反而變本加厲的加緊其屠殺的工作，他們的心是用什麽造成的呢？異曲同工  KK作家庭弟弟的悲哀  寥寥　　窗外刮着北風，電綫不時在呼呼地作響。室內却生着火爐，怪溫暖的，寒署表上的水銀柱高高地向上昇。　　然而弟弟還是感覺到清冷呢，清冷的時鐘踏着清冷的脚步聲清冷的眼淚滴在清冷的小臉上，寂寞而又清冷的時間呵，弟弟坐在清冷的椅上哭了。　　哭聲是寂寞的，不像是一個六歲的孩子的哭聲。淚從眼角淌下來，臉上給開起了許多小溪，小溪湧下來了，桌上就像成了下雨天的馬路。　　望着四周，仍不過是那老一套：明亮的梳妝臺，煨紅的火爐，壁上的裸體畫像，桌下的一大堆破皮鞋，衣架上的雜亂大衣，……沒有一件好玩的東西，沒有一樁新的事物，什麽都在打着瞌　，弟弟於是也打起呵欠來了。　　可是樓下女傭和廚司的狂笑聲吵醒了他的矇朧記起了媽媽臨去時的話：「阿囡，好好地守着家，別給女僕廚司上樓來，當心給偷完東西。等媽夜裏打刀將回來時，準得給你吃牛奶糖。」弟弟的眼睛開呀開的，一下就又見到那四周的生厭的傢具了。　　「碰！」弟弟吃了一大驚，門粗暴地給撞了開來，進來的是爸爸，面孔紅紅的，皺着雙眉。　　「爸爸！」弟弟畏怯地喊，但是得到的只是一個沉悶的「唔」聲。　　提起電話聽筒，爸爸緊漲地問：　　「喂，……此時行情怎樣了？……唔？嗅！」放下聽筒後，爸爸的臉更陰沉下來，披起大衣，又，踏着大步出去了　　心神方定的弟弟，不知措地呆坐着，突然門又開了，哥哥帶一位打扮得花花綠綠的女人跑了進來。　　「快一些才好，小李他們等在百樂門心焦。」　　「呃，當然，我拿一些錢便去的。」哥哥翻着媽媽的皮箱，抽出了一大疊鈔票，便又擁着那女人走了出去。……　　靜靜地，靜靜地，弟弟又寂寞起來了，望着生厭的四周，身子又突然地增加了一陣寒冷，雖然，火爐仍生得紅紅的　　天晚了，獨個兒吞了幾團飯，又獨個兒爬上床去，夢裏仍是清冷地獨個兒。……　　忽然一陣奇怪的聲音噪醒了他，原來那是媽媽的哭聲，還夾着爸爸的怒罵，和哥哥的的自隔壁房裏傳進來的高唱聲。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　「老大，吃冰葫蘆不吃？」趙玉崑突然像耗子一樣的竄了進來，雙腿一縱，便摔去了脚上的棉鞋，接連兩個「小翻，」翻到了坑上去，兩手裏還各擎着一串冰葫蘆。　　他把一串丟給了玉華，同時又假裝要把另一串丟給玉琴，結果却只做了一個空架子，反而往自己嘴裏送了進去。　　「我跟你分吧！」玉華笑着給玉琴說。　　「總不成我作東的人自己不吃！」玉崑很皮賴地說，一面又做了一個鬼臉。　　老大和老三都笑起來了。　　「老二，師傅給你的餑餑錢，我瞧你總是不够化吧？」玉華咬下了一顆冰葫蘆問。　　「總不見得偷你們的吧！」玉崑爽快直僵僵地躺了下去，臉朝着屋瓦。　　「好兄弟，別給我不停口的說啊！」玉崑身子一迸，一個鯉魚挺身，便毫無聲息地站了起來。「仔細給師傅知道了，敎我晚上不用再想偷出去。……」　　三個人正說得上勁，突然門外探進了一張馬面一樣的長的瘦臉來，那是專門在下處裏監管他們的于先生。　　「大家到東院去吧！送皮帽子的人來了。」　　玉華立刻把手裏的冰葫蘆一丟，大踏步走了出去，玉崑也忙着從坑上跳下來；只有玉琴覺得非常躊躇，真像一個快要走上法庭去的囚犯一樣。　　「老二，」將走進東院門口，他就湊在玉崑的耳朶邊說：「你去站在老大的近身，停一會如果他要發什麽脾氣的話，你千萬攔阻他一下。」　　「我理會得！」老二莫明其妙地答應着。　　九十幾個一樣打扮的學生，分着四行站齊了，全部透着很興奮的樣子，暗暗在揣測他們將要得到的禮物的好壞；心裏懷着不同的感覺的祗有玉華和玉琴兩個。（八）奮鬬的人生觀（七）　　希望所以幻滅，由於奮鬥的不力，與不得法，奮鬥不是平常事，要用其能，要盡其能，更要運用得巧妙，那末從前是山窮水盡疑無路，現在却柳暗花又一村，總之，希望始終存在，不會真滅，幻滅就是似滅而實未常滅。</p>

<p>逰藝界息影中的瑙瑪希拉  斯華　　「鑄情」「閨怨」等名片的女主角瑙瑪希拉，自她的丈夫死後，曾一度退隱，「女人」為她東山再起，改變作風的第一部作品，不　問世後又默默無聞，而又告息影了。美國展望雜誌近載有她的訪問記，茲節譯如下，以饗愛好　影的讀者。瑙瑪希拉似乎有二個，一個來自加拿大名城蒙特利爾，懷着雄心，投入影界，與環境掙扎着，幸運地，總算沒有被擯棄。另一個則是與顯赫一時的米高梅巨頭歐文泰堡結為夫婦的，她進影界後第一張拍片合同便是他所簽訂，他造成瑙瑪希拉為好萊塢最愉快最成功的妻子，母親和演員。一九三六年，歐文泰堡與世長逝，她就也暫時退出影壇。　　一九三八年，瑙瑪希拉重返銀幕，對於她的地位何以自置，羣起不經之謠傳；同時米高梅軸心改組問題，也為人所猜測。這種事情雖引起她的不歡，但並不足傷害她，普通女星所不能應付的，米高梅女主人却毫無問題，迎刃而解。　　展望雜誌的攝影記者最近向她作生活訪問，發現她在家時像一個無拘束的孩稚，在預備去爬樹梢。當她被攝入鏡頭時，每一個姿勢都美妙可愛，用不着記者的任何要求或處理。她的住宅建築在加州蒙尼卡，背臨太平洋，是一處風景絕佳的名勝地方。她的游泳池在當地可說是最大的了。池中備有小舟，她時常蕩舟其中。在池的一端另有兒童游憇處，面積相仿，而水深祗有五歲兒童可以起立的程度，這是專為她的五歲愛女凱塞玲和十一歲愛子歐文而設的。她的休息室，書室，臥室的佈置眞是優雅合宜，無瑕可摘，十一年前歐文泰堡和她建此新屋時所陳列的，她僅更動若干小點而仍保持着大部份原來狀態。她除僱有八個傭人整理房舍園地外，僅有私人女侍，書記，和家庭敎師各一位，並不像一般富婦的婢女林立，僕從如雲的豪華。　　她的書室中陳有奧斯卡偶像獎三具，其中兩具是她的丈夫獲得的，有些明星把奧斯卡偶像用作浴室的門飾，但她却非常珍視。桌上置有她和丈夫合攝的儷影，另一桌上則置着喬治賴甫德的肖像（她現在已不和賴甫德時團聚首了）。她的女兒所以叫凱塞玲，是爲了景仰名演員Cornell而題，至於兒子叫歐文，則因孩子的心中已想長大時成功與記憶中可敬的父親一般的偉業。記者要求給孩子們留影，但未蒙允許，因為孩子是歐文泰堡夫人的而不屬於瑙瑪希拉小姐！章臺柳  頋唯道　　約定之後，牧齋即維掘所有，得白銀五千兩，交柳如是帶去。說道：「並非我不肯朵朵解囊，實在我是沒有什麽積蓄，你是完全知道的。煩你轉言毓祺，算我錢某盡了一些心了。請他好好起義，萬不可孟浪將事，自取其殃。」柳如是自己也把伊的妝奩中所有珠寶以及私蓄，湊成萬金之數，藏在行箧裏。自己又化妝扮了男子，悄悄地辭別牧齋，和石達一同上道。暮氣沉沉的錢牧齋，不得不驚嘆河東君的胆魄和熱忱了。柳如是隨着石達，先坐小船到了江陰，然後再到江邊，坐上石達駛來的海舶，開出長江口去。伊雖然帶着金銀財物，因有石達保護，心中無所恇怯。海舶駛過崇明，將近浙境一個小島時，早和黃毓祺的舟師相遇。柳如是遙見帆檣如雲，戈矛耀日，心中不勝歡喜。石達吩咐坐船駛近義師，通報與黃毓祺知道。黃毓祺即請柳夫人過船相見。當石達扶着如是，步上艨　時，兩旁侍衛森列，齊行軍禮。柳如是見了毓祺，因為自己作男子裝，所以長揖道：「黃公別來無恙，今日得見義師。忻喜萬狀。」黃毓祺見柳如是到來，如何不驚奇？忙在舟上設宴款待，殷殷問牧齋近狀。如是以實犒助義師之用。黃毓祺雖有些不滿於牧齋，而見柳如是這樣熱心愛國，紅粉羣袖中間，殊屬不可多得，非常恭敬，石達也陪坐在一邊。（三四）修養要語（十一）　　一個人的私生活，必須十分嚴肅，生活浪漫的人，不特精神無端耗費，對於公事，不能够聚精會神，而且金錢的支出必多，勢必入不敷出，一切失節墮行的結果，都是種因於私生活的浪漫。棋苑  莆田運學正編　　第二三四局　將相聯和　張鼎承擬　　紅先和　　苦盡甘苑着法列下（紅先勝）　　馬三進五　將四平五　卒四進一　將五退一　卒四進一　　將五進一　馬五進三　將五平四　馬二退四　象七進五　　車二進一　士四進五　車二平五　士四退五　車二平六　　士五進四　車六進一　將四進一　卒六進一　將四退一　　卒六進一　將四平五　卒四進一　將五平六　砲六平四　　將六進一　馬三退四（勝）一年一度的「會書」  韋修　　過去，上海戲院，每到廢曆年關封箱以前，例必出演戲班大連合的「會戲」，以為一年完了時的餘興；書塲也有這種習慣，每到年底，例必舉行一年一度的「會書」。　　查舉行「會書」原來的目的，包含着二種主要的作用：一種是慈善性質，一種是競賽性質。　　光裕社對於社友的貧苦遺族，訂有長期救濟的辦法，同時還有成立一個學校，以敎育社友的子弟。在平時從業員經常要按照收入，提取一定的成數，來捐助這種慈善事業的經費，而「會書」的收入，尤為這種經費主要的來源。因為舉行「會書」，從業員同塲東，都不許取任何費用，所有收入，完全歸社中所有，撥作慈善事業的基金。　　社友平時星散各地，集合的機會很少，「會書」就是給以一年一度全體社友集合的機會，並且借此互相競賽，以謀技藝上的進修：而後起之秀的「小晚生」和平時不見經傳得從業員，則往往可以利用這個機會，露其頭角。現在上海許多大嚮檔，像許繼祥，張鴻聲，夏荷生輩，過去都是因為在「會書」唱紅，而後一舉得名稱為大嚮檔的。　　現在上海各書塲所舉行的「會書」，塲東同從業員旣同平時一樣的拆賬，而塲子的活動，又始終在這幾張熟面孔的包辦之下，所以對於慈善同競賽二種原來的作用，已經完全消失：而且檔數無限制的加長，座加又一意的抬高，更跡近「打抽風」了。</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Aid to Democratic Nations Plan: U.S. Congress to Pass with Amendments; Willkie Endorses Granting Power to the President; Will Also Visit England to Inspect War Situation</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's aid-to-Britain plan is likely to be passed by Congress after amendments. However, the amendments will not hinder the President's plan to aid those resisting aggression. Congressional leaders met yesterday, and the result seems to be the proposal of three amendments, which will be accepted: (1) stipulating that Britain must provide some form of guarantee for the airplanes and ships supplied by the United States, such as mortgaging British interests in the Western Hemisphere and its metal and oil production; (2) limiting the President's powers to a certain period, with a maximum limit of two years; and (3) removing the clause in the aid-to-Britain plan that allows British warships to be repaired in U.S. territorial waters. It is generally believed that the above three articles will not seriously affect the main purpose of this plan. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt arrived at his Hyde Park villa this morning and is expected to return to Washington tomorrow morning. According to a White House staff member, if members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives express strong opposition to the President's "Aid to Democratic Nations" proposal, he may return to the capital earlier. This morning, the President had several long-distance telephone conversations with leaders of both houses, mainly discussing how to amend the original proposal so that it could be voted on and passed quickly. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - Mr. Willkie, the Republican presidential candidate who previously lost the election to President Roosevelt, said yesterday that he supported President Roosevelt's Aid to Democratic Nations Act, although "some points differ slightly from his own views." He also said that he would fly to England to inspect the war situation, and may depart in two weeks. He stated, "Under the current circumstances, Congress should grant the President extraordinary powers," but added that Congress should limit the duration of the President's expanded powers. Willkie also said that his trip to England had been approved by Secretary of State Hull, and he was willing to talk with anyone there who was willing to meet him. Willkie also directly rebuked Landon, the Republican candidate in 1936, for his remarks on Saturday. Landon stated that the security guarantee of the United States' future did not solely depend on Britain defeating Germany. Willkie said, "In the current war, who wins and who loses is of great importance to the United States. I specifically rebuke the saying that 'the future of our country has nothing to do with Britain's defeat.'" (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>New York - Willkie stated that he will not go to England for a long time as a U.S. citizen. It is widely believed that the motive for his action is to show Britain that the United States is united and will grant special privileges to Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act. Prominent Republican senators are currently fiercely criticizing the act, as are Democratic senators. Therefore, Willkie's remarks in favor of Roosevelt's proposal have attracted nationwide attention. Opponents of the plan call it a "streamlined declaration of war" and repeatedly state that this plan will temporarily suspend the democratic government of the United States and make the President a dictator, granting him various powers that will lead the United States into war. Senator Fuller of Wisconsin, a progressive Republican, said, "This is not a bill to grant power to the President, but a bill to abolish Congress." Willkie's support for this bill has caused surprise in many quarters. During the heated debate in the Senate, Democrats on the President's side said that Willkie's views on foreign policy were the same as the President's. Willkie has seen the true meaning of this case, which is to concentrate and accelerate aid to beleaguered Britain. As for Willkie's trip to England, many people believe that he may be carrying a certain mission from the government. (International News Service, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Wheeler declared today during a discussion of the American aviation tribunal system that if Congress passes the government's proposal authorizing the President to supply a large number of war materials to various democratic nations, it would be tantamount to the United States openly engaging in full-scale war. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The local newspapers are extremely concerned about President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Arms proposal. Today, they all published the news with large headlines. Tokyo's largest Yomiuri Shimbun stated that if the proposal is passed by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Congress, which has the power to declare war and make peace, will openly challenge the Axis powers. Japan should take all kinds of precautions to prevent all possible incidents. Kokumin Shimbun, a newspaper affiliated with the military, compared the United States to someone holding a weapon and urged the government to expand its military to cope with the new situation. It also stated that Japan must build the world's largest fleet and train the world's largest army, including mechanized units, in order to cope with wars on two or three fronts. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Department of Agriculture to Limit Cotton Fields This Year</h3>
<p>Washington - Because export markets are almost entirely blocked by the war, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has decided to reduce cotton fields in 1941, further reducing the previous government-set target of 12 million bales of cotton by 1 million bales. The government is willing to supply cotton farmers with cotton cloth worth 15 million yuan. This plan aims to prevent the increase of surplus cotton. Cotton farmers who are willing to cooperate in this way can receive government stamps and use these stamps to exchange for cotton cloth at retail prices from stores. In the future, these stamps will be redeemed by the Ministry of Commerce. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Conquered European Nations are Strong Allies of Britain; Resources and Personnel Can Be Supplied Continuously; Another Force Besides the U.S. and Greece</h3>
<p>New York - A survey announced today that although the homelands of Poles, French, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, and Czechs are under Nazi control, they are making significant efforts to contribute to Britain's resistance. While Britain needs substantial assistance from the United States to achieve final victory, the people of these countries are making significant contributions to Britain in terms of manpower and materials. It is said that if the people of these conquered nations are combined with Greece, Britain actually has seven allied countries. In addition to tens of millions of people serving in the army, navy, and air force, fighting alongside Britain, these allies have contributed all the warships, airplanes, and merchant ships that have not fallen into German hands to Britain to the greatest extent possible. According to an official statement from the British Parliament, allied nations have delivered 9 million tons of ships to Britain, which, after offsetting the 4 million tons lost since the start of the war, is more than enough. Poland's most notable contribution is its airmen, who have shot down no fewer than 300 German aircraft in the Battle of Britain, accounting for 10% of the total German losses in the Battle of Britain. The 303rd Squadron alone had destroyed 120 German aircraft by December 11. Sikorski, the Prime Minister of the Polish government in England, reportedly said in mid-November that the Polish Air Force had been greatly strengthened and that in the past there were only 15 squadrons, each with 320 aircraft and thousands of airmen. In addition, thousands of the 75,000 Poles trapped in France have escaped to Britain. Combined with thousands of Polish volunteers from the United States and Canada, they have now formed a new army to defend northern England. In addition, several Polish naval units, including four destroyers and five submarines, have also joined the British Navy. Czechoslovakia's contribution is an army of several thousand people, which has now been greatly strengthened by the addition of 1.5 million Czechs from North America. In addition, Czechoslovakia has contributed an air force with 800 airmen. One Czech Air Force squadron shot down 38 German aircraft in four weeks, and several other squadrons participated in air raids on Germany. Czech troops have also participated in the British war in East Africa. General de Gaulle, leader of the French National Committee, recently stated that the Free French forces fighting alongside the British army include 35,000 armed soldiers, 1,000 airmen, 20 warships, 60 merchant ships, and many military technicians. De Gaulle also brought about the unity of places like Calais, Chad, and Gabon, allowing Britain to control important areas in central Africa. As for the Netherlands, almost its entire navy, with the exception of one destroyer and one gunboat, was initially dedicated to Britain. The Dutch navy in Europe and the East Indies has seven cruisers, eight destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, twenty-one submarines, and several other warships. Several warships under construction are being built in Britain for completion. In addition to supplying land, sea, and air forces, the Netherlands has also donated funds to Britain to purchase 45 Spitfires and 18 bombers. Norway has contributed a total of 4 million tons of modern merchant ships and tankers. In addition, it has contributed several destroyers, submarines, and other warships that escaped to Britain. Norwegian airmen are being trained in Canada, and a small army is already in Britain. Belgium has an army in England, and the ships of the Belgian Congo, totaling 100,000 tons, are now serving for Britain. As for Greece, which is fighting Italy in Albania, it has contributed an army of 400,000 people, a small but effective air force, and a navy that includes one cruiser, 23 destroyers, several torpedo boats, six submarines, and several auxiliary ships. In addition, it has contributed several strategically important naval and air bases. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Espionage Cases: Number of Offenders Increasing</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Last year, there were a total of 43 cases, involving 51 people, tried by the Tokyo District Court for violating the Anti-Espionage Law, including one foreigner. Most of the offenders were photography enthusiasts, and only four people were arrested and convicted for taking secret photographs. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Osaka - Starting today, the 15th, a three-day campaign to prevent sabotage by spies will be implemented here. The purpose is to prevent spies from damaging machinery and other industrial facilities in order to reduce the nation's wartime production capacity. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Destroys Turin Arsenal in Italy; British Cruiser Reportedly Sunk in Mediterranean Attacks</h3>
<p>London - On Saturday, when British Air Force bombers flew to Turin, Italy to attack the Royal Arsenal, the Italian side made a new attempt to obstruct British aircraft traveling between Britain and northern Italy. Anti-aircraft gun teams had been set up on the Italian slopes of the Alps, and they opened fire for the first time. Despite encountering artillery fire and the difficulties of flying over the Alps in winter, British aircraft arrived at their destination in batches shortly after midnight. The sky over Turin was almost cloudless, so British aircraft were able to clearly identify railways, streets, and the Po River. Several British aircraft carried very large bombs, along with many incendiary bombs, and dropped them on the Royal Arsenal like raindrops. They exploded instantly, followed by continuous explosions and rising flames. When the British aircraft flew back over the Alps, they were still able to see the flames of the explosions. One British aircraft, while flying over the Alps, had its bomb release mechanism freeze, preventing it from attacking the arsenal. It continued flying until the mechanism thawed, and then bombed the Fiat factory and another factory. The British aircraft also dropped four-page leaflets with Churchill's recent speech. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - Last night, the German Air Force continued its second night of targeting London as its main objective. Bombs fell in various parts of London. British night fighters and anti-aircraft guns engaged the enemy aircraft. It was reported that enemy aircraft had intruded near Liverpool, a city in northeastern England, and a city in western England. It has now been confirmed that in the week ending at midnight on January 11, several German aircraft were shot down in air battles over British territory, and only one British fighter was lost. Another noteworthy fact is that the German side admitted that six German aircraft were lost during the attack on Portsmouth on the night of January 10, while the British side announced that only two German aircraft were shot down. Apparently, the remaining four German aircraft losses were not directly witnessed by the British Air Force. Comparative figures for aircraft losses in the western desert are not yet available. However, noteworthy events in the recent Mediterranean air battles include the confirmed loss of 30 Italian aircraft in the air and at least 8 destroyed on the ground between December 22 and January 5. In the following week, over 100 Italian aircraft were destroyed. On January 6, British aircraft bombed 40 Italian aircraft on the ground at El Agheila, rendering them unusable. On January 8, 12 Italian aircraft were bombed and destroyed on the ground at Benina. On January 9, five Italian bombers were destroyed in Malta. Only two aircraft on the ground at Gavieru and several Italian aircraft in the Bardia area were also destroyed. Since January 5, two Savoia Italian aircraft at Nothuba, two at Gazala, and seven at El Adem have also been destroyed. Furthermore, the vanguard of the British army discovered 35 Italian aircraft that had already been destroyed at Gazala. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Improvement of Japanese-Soviet Relations Has Become a Bubble</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Central Commercial News published an editorial today, asking the government to take necessary steps to correct the current situation because the people are currently groping in the dark regarding the state of Japanese-Soviet relations. As for British-Japanese relations and American-Japanese relations, the people can still guess and ascertain the truth, but regarding the Soviet Union, very little information is obtained, so they are ignorant of the truth. Everyone knows that the fishery negotiations between the two countries could have been concluded at the end of last month, but now there is no news, making it impossible to understand the actual situation. It also said that we thought that after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, Japanese-Soviet relations could be expected to become clearer, but it has now become a bubble. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Contrast Between the U.S. and Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were two overseas dispatches that can be taken as a very interesting contrast. The first, from Washington, stated that Mr. Willkie, the Republican presidential candidate who previously lost the election to President Roosevelt, announced yesterday that he supported Roosevelt's Aid to Democratic Nations Act. He also said that under the current circumstances, Congress should grant the President extraordinary powers. He added that his trip abroad was happily preceded by soliciting the consent of his political opponent. The second, from Tokyo, stated that a certain Japanese magazine with a wide circulation recently used "Do You Know the Meaning of the New Structure?" as a question to solicit responses from readers, and the majority of people answered that they did not know what the new structure meant. It turns out that it is not surprising that businessmen are completely ignorant of this, but the majority of people also included civil servants, teachers, students, and other types of people. The magazine considers this a very noteworthy fact. Judging from the content of these two dispatches themselves, they can be said to be completely unrelated. However, based on these two dispatches, if we try to explore the fundamental political systems and national characters of the U.S. and Japan, we can obtain fresh and practical information on a major issue in the trend of the times.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy, in their current laws, political systems, and in reality, are completely totalitarian states. As for Japan, although its constitution has never been regarded as a normal democratic polity from the beginning, its application over the decades, following the example of Britain, has been quite successful. Its parliament and political parties' deliberation and decision-making have become a source of political power and a repository of authority. If it had adhered to the model and evolved gradually, it should have been listed among the democratic nations. However, the unprovoked initiation of the September 18th Incident ten years ago ultimately led to a state of undeclared war against China. During this period, it repeatedly staged political tragedies, so the source of its political power and authority has, in fact, shifted into the hands of the military. Last summer, when Konoe was re-appointed as Prime Minister, he called for a new structure and made many changes. Thus, the situation of the military in power took a step further and gradually entered a stage of "legalization" and "institutionalization." Now it is a totalitarian state that is not yet fully mature, and it is aspiring to and striving for this model in the hope of maturing as soon as possible. From a certain perspective, to examine the fundamental consciousness of the three totalitarian states of Germany, Italy, and Japan, one can take their faded anti-communist pact, which was aimed at the Soviet Union, as a symbol. However, in terms of the logic of the current stage, the so-called totalitarian state has become a clear opposition to the democratic state. For ten years, the totalitarian states have been promoting their totalitarian political systems and theories with their unique logic, and using ridicule of democracy as negative material. On the one hand, they have been implementing aggression by force, emphasizing their totalitarian political systems and theories through the progress of aggression, and the various "disappointments" of the democratic international (?) have provided them with excellent material, either in small or large quantities. Politics is originally a matter of fact rather than theory. Therefore, although democracy has been embraced by the vast majority of humanity for a century, and it is theoretically and in the political systems of various countries stated that democracy should be the normal foundation of the nation and the basis of political power in modern states, in fact, it has suffered from the turbulence of the past ten years, leading to the appearance of this ebb and flow between democracy and totalitarianism. Faced with this ebb and flow, people who uphold democracy can only smile bitterly and feel threatened. When France was defeated, collapsed, and surrendered in the European war last summer, Germany achieved a victory that was close to surpassing what wisdom could imagine. At that time, it seemed that there was a political classroom where the totalitarian teacher was whipping the democratic students, and also lecturing the students: This is the truth!</p>
<p>"Politics is originally a matter of fact rather than theory." The truth of democracy can be proclaimed for thousands of years, but the facts of the past ten years have rebelled, almost making democracy not only unable to sit high on the throne of truth, but also shaking or even overturning the existing democracy. Since the facts and theories are so far apart, it almost makes the majority of humanity restless and unsure of where to settle. However, truth is, after all, truth. All perversions must have a factual limit, and all truths will eventually be explained by facts. After the madness of the perversion, there are facts like these: France was defeated, but Britain was not, showing that democratic nations are not necessarily defeated. Germany is strong, but Italy is not, showing that totalitarian states are not necessarily strong. This at least asserts that the strength and weakness of a nation has nothing to do with democracy or totalitarianism, and at least breaks the superstition of totalitarianism. The facts under the truth do not stop there. In Japan: they have deployed their entire nation's army and decades of savings to wage an undeclared war against China, and their entire people can hardly find a satisfactory and appropriate word to express what they can truly acknowledge as the meaning and purpose of the war against China, unless it is the new order mentioned in the phrasebook. Konoe has the support of the military, holds great power, and devotes his full strength to creating the so-called new structure. Recently, a certain magazine revealed the confusion of the Japanese intellectual class and even the majority of people regarding the new structure. These facts may be explained by the fact that the totalitarian political system is based on the spirit that the people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to understand. However, the training of the entire people that totalitarianism touts, to make them understand, to make them sincerely convinced and work together with the entire nation, has been exposed by a certain magazine. On the other hand, what is the atmosphere of democracy? In the United States, under democracy, there is a two-party opposition, and the current policy and the current president are based on the Democratic Party. However, Willkie, the Republican who lost the presidential election, frankly supports the national policy set by his political opponent, advocates that his political opponent obtain greater power, and happily seeks the consent of his political opponent before traveling abroad. This kind of atmosphere makes one wonder where the reasons lie for totalitarianism, such as Germany and Italy, not allowing the existence of multiple parties and insisting on one party and one party member, and for totalitarianism, such as Japan, striving to destroy all parties and advocating no party as governance. Conversely, the facts of universal understanding and universal cooperation are not in totalitarian Japan but in democratic America! To what extent can a country that can be made to follow but cannot be made to understand create strength, and to what extent can a country with universal understanding and universal cooperation create strength? Comparing the two, it can be asserted that the achievements will ultimately be vastly different. And the fact that the entire United States has become an arsenal, becoming an arsenal for anti-aggression democratic nations, is seen as possible at present, and will be seen as a reality in the future. This is the convergence of fact and theory, and this is the truth of democracy!</p>

As for Bangkok's threat to bomb Saigon and Phnom Penh (the capital of Cambodia), it is not taken seriously here. If that country recklessly carries out its threat, French planes will immediately and fiercely bomb Bangkok in retaliation.

<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Vigorously Implements Food Management Policy</h3>
<p>Public Purchase Bureaus Established in All Counties Next Month; 600 Trained District Chiefs to Serve as Managers of Public Purchase Bureaus</p>
<p>Fuzhou: Food management in Fujian Province is now being extended from Yong'an and Nanping to Fuzhou and Jian'ou. Food for the residents of the two cities is already widely supplied by the Public Purchase Bureaus. Residents can register with the Public Purchase Bureaus based on their household registration and rice purchase certificates, and retail stores that distribute rice purchase rice at the set price. In Fuzhou, one yuan can buy two and a half jin, and in Jian'ou, four jin and twelve liang. The supply situation in Jian'ou is particularly stable. Although food management has not yet been widely implemented in southern Fujian, the recent government adjustment of supply and demand has lowered prices. Quanzhou lacked more than 100,000 shi in the first half of the year, and neighboring rice-producing counties have been designated to supply it. The county prepares the price and purchases and transports it at 28 yuan per 100 jin for distribution and sale. Zhangzhou is also implementing price stabilization sales. Around the New Year, the price of rice fell to more than ten yuan per shi. In order to vigorously implement the food management policy, the provincial government has specifically designated this year as the Food Management Year. This month, more than 600 outstanding district chiefs from various counties will be selected and trained before being assigned to serve as deputy managers of the Public Purchase Bureaus in various counties. Starting next month, the secretaries of the Food Management Committees in various counties and the Public Purchase Bureaus in various counties will be widely established. All counties in the province are now ordered to hold a Food Management Propaganda Week, with the rural masses as the main target of propaganda, and especially mobilizing rural Baojia to publicize widely, so that they understand the meaning of food management. The Provincial Food General Management Office will be renamed the Food Management Bureau from New Year's Day, and the Public Purchase General Bureau will be renamed the General Management Office of the Public Purchase Bureau, and will be transferred to the Food Management Bureau to comply with the new system set by the central government.

<h3>Soviet Union Orders Reorganization of Industry</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet government yesterday ordered a major reorganization of Russian industry to expand the production of food and consumer goods. The Soviet industry that produces food and consumer goods will be strictly decentralized by order of Stalin and Molotov. The new procedure stipulates that hundreds of small and medium-sized factories should be established throughout the country. The location and equipment for their establishment should depend on the availability of raw materials produced in the area, thus avoiding transportation, trading, and exchange. Under this long-term production program, the Soviet Union will mobilize all local resources to achieve maximum economic benefits. (Dispatch of the 13th, International News Service)</p>
<h3>Small and Medium-Sized Factories Established Throughout the Soviet Union to Meet Local Needs</h3>

<h3>Japan Determined to Maintain Shipping Services to the United States; Will Not Abandon Them Until the Last Possible Moment</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun recently published a speech by Murata, in which he stated that even if the shipping situation continues to worsen, we are prepared. However, we must maintain the North American shipping route at any cost, in order to retain our rights and, if necessary, to transport Japanese residents out of dangerous areas. I believe that even if Japanese-American relations continue to deteriorate, the U.S. government will not detain Japanese merchant ships docked in U.S. ports. In short, even if Japanese-American trade continues to decrease, shipping services to the United States will not be abandoned until the last possible moment. In this regard, the government has prepared for both the evacuation of overseas residents and the alteration of shipping routes, and is now studying various emergency measures to be implemented if Japanese merchant ships are unable to sail to the west coast of the United States.

<h3>Japan to Hold Five-Minister Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo: In order to strengthen its lineup and confront the parliament, which is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month, the Japanese government will replace the three-minister conference with a five-minister conference. In addition to the Ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, and Commerce, the Prime Minister will also participate in the conference to discuss the economic problems of "Greater East Asia," the problems of coping with the Anglo-American joint strategy in the Pacific, and the problems of controlling international trade.

<h3>Public Confused About Meaning of New Japanese Structure; Magazine Seeks Opinions; 90% Unaware</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A popular magazine sought opinions from readers on the question, "Do you understand the meaning of the new structure?" Based on the replies received, the magazine concluded that the majority of the Japanese people are completely unaware of the meaning of the "new structure" recently created by Japanese leaders. Nine out of ten replies stated that they did not know the meaning of the new structure, and no writer, journalist, or magazine editor has written an article explaining that they understand what the "new structure" is. According to the magazine's criticism, this is a noteworthy fact, and the majority of people who have received a considerable education, including civil servants and students, are among those who are completely unaware of the new structure. Merchants, who are dissatisfied with various control measures, are also naturally among those who are "unaware." More than half of the replies expressed the opinion that the meaning of the new structure is difficult to understand. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)</p>

<p>broadcasted. Filov reiterated Bulgaria's policy of peace and neutrality and of revising treaties by peaceful means, and expressed sympathy for the Axis powers and their new European order. However, he cautiously avoided mentioning the possibility of German intervention in Bulgarian affairs. He said that although Bulgaria hoped for peace, it might have to go through a tragic period. The issue of war and peace did not rest with small countries. The great changes caused by President Roosevelt's words and decisions might lead to a world war. Bulgaria must be cautious, because what we need to know is not only who will win, but also how to achieve victory. We know that there will be a new Europe after the war, and Bulgaria and other countries will be affected by it. Therefore, Bulgaria must remain calm and impartial. We must not be pro-German or pro-British, but be prepared to sacrifice everything for Bulgaria. The government's policy has always been peace, but it also advocates treaty revision. We have wanted to revise the treaties from the beginning, and we still demand to do so by peaceful means. Romania has already ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government firmly believes that it can go further along this path. The Bulgarian government hopes that other injustices can be corrected. Filov asked the people to remain calm and prepare for unforeseen events. He also said that it is Bulgaria's duty to defend its essential interests and deal with any eventuality. Finally, he said that Nazi or communist regimes are not suitable for Bulgaria. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Sofia. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov said yesterday in Rusmik, near the Romanian border, that as a result of President Roosevelt's promise to do his best to help Britain, war will threaten the whole world. Filov said that Bulgaria is in the middle of German and Turkish troop concentrations, but has decided to defend its rights and freedoms by force if necessary. He said that the biggest goal of Bulgaria's foreign policy is to avoid war. He would reportedly meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Vienna. Filov told the people that unless they were willing to "fall into slavery," they should be ready to fight at any time. The speech included friendly tones toward the "powerful nations" of Germany and Italy, which is noteworthy. Regarding the remarks involving President Roosevelt's procedures, it is generally believed that they are not unfriendly to the United States, but merely a statement of fact, saying that American aid is enough to prolong the war, and Bulgaria may eventually be dragged into the war.

<p>Sofia. The Bulgarian government launched a campaign against anti-national propaganda simultaneously in cities large and small across the country yesterday, urging the people to support the government's actions and domestic and foreign policies. Cabinet ministers and members of parliament all gave speeches. Prime Minister Filov said that the government will severely punish those engaged in anti-national propaganda in accordance with the "Law on the Protection of the State."

<p>Sofia. Bulgarian newspapers believe that the newly revised Soviet-German commercial treaty is a response to President Roosevelt's decision to aid Britain, and they feel that the strengthening of Soviet-German relations is not only very beneficial to the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, but also helps Bulgaria to realize its demand for treaty revision by peaceful means, which holds that it should "start with Western Thrace first." According to the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, Western Thrace, except for Karagach, was ceded to Greece. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<h3>French Commentary on Soviet-German Relations</h3>
<p>Vichy. Observers here have recently commented on the expansion of the original economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, stating briefly that the establishment of the new economic agreement has dispelled rumors that friction has occurred between Germany and the Soviet Union recently. Although this agreement is of a technical nature, the large increase in the volume of trade between the two parties in the coming year is sufficient to show that the policy adopted by the Soviet Union when it signed the non-aggression treaty with Germany in August of the previous year will continue to be implemented as always. The agreement on the migration of overseas Chinese further proves that each other recognizes that the current borders have a definite nature. The only outstanding issue at present is the navigation problem in the lower reaches of the Danube River, because the Soviet government has always demanded to jointly control the mouth of the river with Romania. However, since the overall relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is very good, it is expected that this outstanding issue will not cause much difficulty. In terms of the situation in the Balkans, rumors have been rife in the past week, and people's minds have been restless. It was even rumored that German troops had entered Bulgaria on Wednesday of last week, but this was not the case. Therefore, people's minds have obviously become calmer. For example, according to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the people of that country are very calm and view the various rumors spread by foreign radio stations with a skeptical attitude. Since the outbreak of the European War in September 1939, such rumors have occurred repeatedly, and each time they have proved to be fabricated. In short, the countries of Southeastern Europe have great confidence in Germany's repeated assurances that the Balkan Peninsula must maintain peace, and believe that the country will continue to devote itself to the completion of the Balkan economic organization, because this is in the country's interest. The country's attitude in the past sixteen months is sufficient proof. As for the reason why the country has strengthened its military situation within Romania, the main reason is to prevent the crises that the Italian-Greek war may directly or indirectly cause. (Havas telegram from the 12th)</p>
<p>Vichy. The economic agreement signed by Germany and the Soviet Union a few days ago was recently commented on by "Le Temps," which believes that the Soviet Union has provided part of its natural resources for use by Germany. The article said: "The relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is still developing in accordance with the non-aggression treaty signed by the two parties in August 1939. This is beyond doubt. At this moment, the Soviet Union is providing Germany with powerful economic assistance, and the recent agreement signed by the two parties will greatly expand the scope of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is also a fact that is obvious to all. Recalling August 1939, people often thought that due to technical reasons, the Soviet Union might not be able to provide Germany with the economic assistance that it expected, but today the Soviet Union has obviously provided part of its natural resources for use by Germany. This matter is of great importance to Germany's economic situation, especially at a time when the current European war is gradually evolving into a war of attrition."

<p>Istanbul. A senior official of the Turkish government said that if German troops cross Romania and enter Bulgaria, Turkey should declare war. He also said that the attempt of the German divisions currently concentrated in Romania may be revealed in the next two weeks. The Germans' attempt is nothing more than the following three: (1) exert pressure on or even attack the Soviet Union; (2) attack Turkey and simultaneously attack Greece; (3) only protect the Romanian oil fields to prevent internal disturbances in Romania or British bombing of the oil fields.

<h3>British and Australian Troops Concentrate to Attack. The Fall of Tobruk is Imminent.</h3>
<p>About one division of Italian troops is isolated. Italy abandons air bases in eastern Libya.</p>
<p>Cairo. It is widely believed that the fall of Tobruk will happen soon. According to the latest news, a large number of British and Australian troops, heavy artillery, and tanks are now rapidly concentrating on the city in preparation for the final attack. Today, British artillery shelled the besieged city non-stop throughout the day. The water wells of the Italian garrison were also the target of shelling. At the same time, British fighter and bomber squadrons have destroyed all Italian air force bases within 70 miles of Tobruk. Although the main action of the British army a few days ago was to continue to concentrate around Tobruk, it is reported that another Italian army column, the strength of one division, has been isolated in the fertile land of Qirab al-Ba'shan, 150 miles south of Bardia. The area is close to the Egyptian border, and the surrender of the Italian army is only a matter of time. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Cairo. A British Middle East Air Force communique announced that the Italians have abandoned the airfields in eastern Libya and that British aircraft have launched fierce attacks on various airfields and other targets to the west. It is said that British fighter patrols in eastern Libya have discovered that in Derna, Martuba, El Tmimi, and Gazala, there are only a large number of unserviceable Italian aircraft and no aircraft that can fight. On January 10, the British Air Force raided the Benina and Berka airfields at night, and large fires and explosions broke out near the aircraft parked in the field. Benghazi was also attacked, and ships have been badly damaged. On January 9, a British fighter squadron destroyed three Italian aircraft. Two more Italian aircraft were shot down while attempting to land in Derna on the same day. Another three Italian aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. The enemy also seems to have abandoned its seaplane base in Bomba. The British Naval Air Arm attacked Bardia, hitting one ship with one bomb. Another four ships were also damaged. Bombs hit warehouses, causing fires and explosions. The Caproni factory and gasoline depot in Maiadaqa, Italian East Africa, and the Papila area were all attacked by British aircraft. None of the British aircraft that flew out for attacks and reconnaissance were lost. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Cairo. According to a British military headquarters communique this morning, yesterday's fierce air raids were a special feature of the British army's preparations for the final attack on Tobruk. It also said that the British Air Force imitated the same strategy as the capture of Bardia, dropping several tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs on airfields and military bases along the Italian coast throughout Libya. At the same time, British mechanized units launched forward assaults and obtained several important positions between Tobruk and another base in Derna. Military sources said that the purpose of the joint land and air attacks was to paralyze the Italian air defense, cut off reinforcements from entering Tobruk, and make it impossible for the Italian army to retreat.

<p>Italian War Report</p>
<p>Rome. According to the Italian military headquarters, artillery battles and reconnaissance activities continued on the Greek front. Italian aircraft bombed and strafed enemy troops. In Cyrenaica, there were artillery battles around Tobruk. The Italian army in the Jerabub desert was quite active. Enemy outposts were bombed. Enemy aircraft bombed various parts of Cyrenaica without casualties. Italian aircraft hit a giant ship in the western Mediterranean. In East Africa, enemy troops attacked on the Sudanese front and have been repelled. The Italian army, assisted by artillery, severely damaged the enemy troops. Italian aircraft also bombed enemy troop positions and vehicles in various parts of Sudan. Enemy aircraft attacked Turin last night, causing considerable damage and injuring several people. Enemy aircraft bombed Venice, causing slight damage and injuring several people, killing one person. Catania was also bombed without casualties, and one enemy aircraft was shot down. One enemy aircraft was also shot down in Venice, and six pilots were captured. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Italian Commander-in-Chief in Albania, General Soddu, Resigns. Greek Troops Have Crossed Këlcyrë. It is rumored that Italy and Greece will reach an understanding.</h3>
<p>Rome. General Soddu, the Italian commander-in-chief in Albania, has asked for leave due to ill health. The current Italian Chief of General Staff, Cavallero, has been ordered to command Italian military operations in Albania. (Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>London. The news of the resignation of General Soddu, the Italian commander-in-chief in Albania, was released in Rome at noon today. Soddu is the third person to resign after attempting to stop the advance of Greek troops without success. Although the announcement of the resignation stated that Soddu had resigned due to illness, it is still unknown whether this is true or whether Mussolini dismissed him due to the continued defeat of the Italian army in Albania. It is reported that his vacant position will be concurrently held by Italian Chief of Staff General Cavallero. The main reason for this approach is that Mussolini has no one else to send due to the recent successive resignations of a large number of Italian military leaders. It is said that Cavallero was not well-known in military circles when he took over as Chief of Staff after General Badoglio, and his experience in military operations is far less rich than in political affairs. Therefore, it has been decided to appoint him to command the combat troops, and the results will be quite noteworthy. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>London. According to today's news, Greek troops continued to advance northwest of Këlcyrë. Although the distance is not very great, the military significance is quite significant, because Greek troops have crossed Këlcyrë and are advancing along the road to Tepelenë. Although one Italian division recently arrived in Tepelenë to reinforce it, its position is still extremely precarious. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Athens. A Greek communique said that Greek troops carried out limited reconnaissance and artillery activities in Albania and captured a number of Italian soldiers. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Struga. A large Italian mechanized convoy recaptured the town of Dolzaj yesterday. The town is located on the road from Tepelenë to Delvinë, 14 miles northwest of Tepelenë. Nine British and Greek aircraft bombed the key port of Durrës in Albania yesterday, damaging the docks there and burning one Italian ship in the port. When the squadron flew back to Greece, it bombed the Italian airfield in Elbasan along the way. One Greek aircraft was shot down in this operation. (United Press telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Belgrade. German sources here have recently spread a message saying that Greece and Italy are about to reach an understanding and stop the war in Albania, because German troops are reportedly concentrated in the Danube River area within Romania, facing Bulgaria. Political circles here have heard the news from the German side, and they say that the concentration of German troops in the area opposite Bulgaria may constitute a kind of threat, so that Germany can exert diplomatic pressure on Athens.

<h3>Panama Considers Adopting a New Constitution. The full text has 189 articles.</h3>
<p>Washington. The Republic of Panama, located at the "crossroads" of the world, is currently considering adopting a new constitution. Copies of the original text of the constitution have been sent to the United States and other countries in the Americas and are being closely studied by constitutional experts. However, these studies are purely academic. One of the twenty-one requirements of this new constitution is to change the term of office of the President of the Republic of Panama from four years to six years. There is also a provisional clause that, if adopted, would extend the term of President Arias, who took office on October 1, 1940, to February 15, 1947, comparing him to the President who was elected in mid-June 1940 and whose term of office was extended by two years and five and a half months. This new constitution, which has one hundred and eighty-nine articles from the first article onwards, has been personally submitted by President Arias to the National Assembly and is intended to replace the constitution adopted on February 13, 1904, after Panama seceded from Colombia. The original constitution stipulated that the President could not be elected for a second consecutive term, but under this new draft constitution, President Arias would also not be allowed to be immediately re-elected after his original term expired, but would be allowed to return to office after the term of another president in the middle expired. This provision also prohibits the re-election of the president. The second article of this new constitution also has some overtones of rejecting individual freedom and advocating power. The meaning of this article is quite different from the theories of Montesquieu, the American constitution, and other constitutions that advocate popular sovereignty. This new Panamanian constitution states that the power of the public is in the state and is exercised by the state in accordance with the methods of the constitution. The Congress has thirty members, each representing 20,000 residents. It convenes an ordinary meeting every two years on New Year's Day and adjourns after four months. Article 72 of the new constitution also stipulates that the President may convene Congress to hold special meetings, but can only discuss matters proposed by the President. The President and cabinet officials may speak in Congress, and cabinet officials should answer questions when asked by members of Congress. Cabinet officials may also hold the position of members of Congress. The new constitution also stipulates that Congress may temporarily allow the President special privileges to deal with special purposes. This privilege can be exercised if it is passed by a majority of the committee organized by representatives in Congress. The new constitution also has some interesting provisions regarding the issues of nationality and racial naturalization. Anyone born in Panama, if their parents are not of a foreign race, is a Panamanian national. Also, any people whose parents are one foreign race and one Panamanian are also Panamanian nationals. Children born abroad, if their parents were born in Panama, are also Panamanians, the same as those born before November 3, 1903 in the territory that is now Panama, but which was not then separated from Colombia. The constitution also has provisions for immigration. All blacks, yellows, and races from India, Asia Minor, and North Africa whose languages are not Castilian are classified as "prohibited from immigration." The naturalization of people is permitted by the President. Anyone who has resided in Panama for more than five years, or who has resided for more than three years and has children of Panamanian nationality, or who has resided for more than two years and is married to a Panamanian, may be naturalized as a Panamanian national. In addition to the original constitution, foreigners must reside in Panama for more than ten years, or for more than three years and marry a Panamanian before they can be naturalized. Article 44 of the new legal code stipulates public collection methods. Any land collected by the state for public use should have judicial rulings and fair debts should be prepaid, but in the event of war, disturbances of public order, epidemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies, the government may expropriate without compensation. The state is responsible for the collection actions implemented by the executive department. Article 142 stipulates that cultivating the land is the landlord's duty to society and can be managed by the state. The new constitution also stipulates the abolition of the death penalty and respect for the law of habeas corpus. If any people believe that the treatment they have received from government officials is unconstitutional, they may request an edict to grant such people the protection permitted by the constitution.

<h3>Britain, the United States, and Australia Will Establish a Joint Front in the South Pacific. The Australian Prime Minister Plans to Visit London. Japan Pays Attention to the United States' Use of Singapore.</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Australian Prime Minister Menzies' planned visit to London and the British side's proposal that the United States can use Singapore at any time and in any way "to promote American purposes or protect its own interests in the South Pacific" when British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Halifax recently met with U.S. Special Envoy to Britain Hopkins have aroused attention in Tokyo. It is believed that the reasonable development of Menzies' trip will be the establishment of an anti-Japanese front by Britain, the United States, and Australia in the South Pacific. Responsible persons recalled that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told foreign journalists on December 9 last year that this possible event would cause Japan to be extremely concerned. Regarding the reported confiscation of money and documents from several Japanese passengers on an American ship that arrived in Bermuda, the Japanese side has sent a note to the British side, and the British Embassy here and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs are waiting for a reply from London. (North China Daily News telegram from the 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to Japanese sources in Singapore, Australian Army Minister Spender arrived in Singapore on Saturday after inspecting Australian and New Zealand troops in India, Egypt, and Palestine. He recently broadcasted in the area, saying that Australia has no disputes with Japan, and hopes that the Pacific can live up to its name. We have been neighbors for a long time, and it would be a great misfortune if there were any major misunderstandings. I only hope that the Japanese people will recognize the existence of friendly relations, which will be in the interests of both parties. He also praised the achievements of the Australian army in the Libyan desert. During his visit to Singapore, he met with Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, commander-in-chief of the British Far East forces. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)</p>

<h3>Li Hsi's Mission to France and Nomura's Mission to the United States</h3>
<p>U.S.'s newly appointed ambassador to France, Li Hsi, and Japan's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Nomura, are both admirals. This coincidence is rare in the history of international diplomacy and carries particularly profound significance. The New York Times' report is translated as follows:</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's transfer of Admiral Li Hsi, the Governor of Puerto Rico, to be the ambassador to France was first announced to the press by the President's Secretary, Hassett. Although he was unwilling to elaborate, he stated that Admiral Li Hsi has many years of naval experience, is skilled in defensive strategies, and is deeply valued by the President. He was particularly relied upon by the President when he served as Chief of Naval Operations.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt initially considered General Pershing, a distinguished figure in the army, for the position of ambassador to France. General Pershing had a very close relationship with Marshal Petain, the current French Head of State, during the last European war, and was therefore considered for the position. However, General Pershing declined due to his doctor's advice, and the President then appointed Li Hsi to this difficult task.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, most of the U.S. ambassadors to European countries, except for Ambassador Steinhardt in the Soviet Union, have returned home one after another. After Li Hsi's arrival, he will become the second most active U.S. ambassador in Europe. (Note: U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Philip, has also recently departed to return to his post.)</p>
<p>Admiral Li Hsi was a core member of the American navalism faction and worked closely with President Roosevelt in implementing the naval expansion plan. In light of the uncertain fate of French African ports, the situation in the Mediterranean, and the disposition of the French fleet, many believe that Admiral Li Hsi, with his experience and prestige, is the most suitable person to serve as ambassador to France. According to Washington officials, Admiral Li Hsi is capable of enhancing France's courage and preventing the disintegration of its colonies.</p>
<p>The United States is greatly concerned about France's territories in the Atlantic and Pacific, namely Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, Dakar on the coast of West Africa, and Vietnam in the Far East. If sovereignty over these territories is transferred to Germany and Italy, or if they are allowed to be fully utilized by them, it would threaten the security of the United States. Admiral Li Hsi should also encourage the Vichy government to strengthen its support for the Vietnamese authorities in resisting the aggression of the Japanese army and navy.</p>
<p>In short, the United States' appointment of an ambassador to France is a forceful move taken in response to various overseas events. Observing this action, the French people, who are currently facing numerous wounds and sufferings, can understand that the friendship of the United States is not fickle, but reliable in times of need. They can also know that defeated France is not isolated, and the United States will not abandon them to the arbitrary control of Germany.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese government's dispatch of former Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura as ambassador to the United States, after this news was announced, some American expatriates in Tokyo who had already booked tickets to return home canceled their tickets and postponed their departure. According to Japanese newspapers, Foreign Minister Matsuoka's selection of this ambassador has eased the current crisis between the United States and Japan. In reality, although Nomura's appointment in a time of crisis can be said to be timely, it is feared that it will serve no other purpose than to delay the matter and avoid immediately "showing its cards" to the United States!</p>
<p>As for Nomura's strategy towards the United States, it can be glimpsed from the policies he pursued during his tenure as Foreign Minister. At that time, he drafted a plan to promptly resolve the damages suffered by the American people during the Sino-Japanese War, thereby easing the tense relations between the United States and Japan. However, the question is whether this method of easing the tensions of 1939 can salvage the situation after 1940. The current crisis is not merely caused by the damages suffered by Americans during the war. The crucial point is Japan's conclusion of a military alliance treaty with Germany. Americans believe that this treaty is an attempt to intimidate the United States.</p>
<p>This American perception is not due to any misunderstanding of the treaty's provisions, but rather is caused by the aggressive speeches of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Konoe stated that "The issue of peace or war in the Pacific will depend on whether the Japanese or Americans can understand and respect each other's positions." He also advised the United States that "Japan, Germany, and Italy are building a new world order and making it conform to the new world trend. The United States must consider and understand this. If the United States cannot understand Japan's true intentions, then there is no other path but to go to war." Two days later, he added that the Japanese should "prepare to cope with the worst situation."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Matsuoka also declared to all countries that "If all countries wish to reduce the damages they suffer to the minimum, they must abandon all actions to aid the Chongqing government."</p>
<p>However, the result of these warnings was the opposite. As the British government announced the reopening of the Burma Road, the U.S. government simultaneously advised expatriates in the Far East to evacuate. Canada then banned the shipment of copper to Japan, and 4,200 members of the U.S. Naval Reserve followed suit, heading to naval bases in the Pacific to join the fleet.</p>
<p>Since the United States and Britain have indicated their readiness to "show their cards," Japan does not seem to have such a resolution. Stepping back, even if we admit that Konoe and Matsuoka's remarks were due to misunderstandings of the American situation, and even if we acknowledge that Nomura's mission to the United States is an indication of Japan's initial intentions, the fundamental cause of the discord between Japan and the United States has not disappeared.</p>
<p>Forced by circumstances, Japan is attempting to implement a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union and the United States. Admiral Nomura's mission to the United States and Lieutenant General Tatekawa's mission to the Soviet Union are two gestures of Japan's effort to avoid isolation. On the other hand, it strengthened the Japan-Germany alliance, misjudging the impact of this alliance on the United States, thinking that the United States could be intimidated. The result was that it provoked the anger of the American people, which was not what it had expected.</p>

<h3>Current Educational Situation in Haimen and Qidong: Maintaining with Great Effort Amid Difficult Circumstances</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent in Northern Jiangsu) More than two years after the fall of various counties and county seats in the Tongru District of Northern Jiangsu, education personnel in various counties have been able to faithfully and diligently perform their duties despite the difficult circumstances. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education recently received a report from a supervisor inspecting the educational conditions in various counties in the Tong District, which records the details. The current educational situations in Haimen and Qidong counties are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Haimen: Wang Feng, the director of the Haimen Education Bureau, has just taken office this semester and has formulated concrete plans for the implementation of education. Lu Shusheng, the supervisor, has been quite diligent in his routine inspection work. Education funding includes both direct collection and county government collection, totaling 122,565.51 yuan. On the expenditure side, education administration expenses are 14,952 yuan, general education expenses are 17,438 yuan, compulsory education expenses are 72,597 yuan, social education expenses are 8,580 yuan, and temporary expenses are 8,240 yuan. The safekeeping of funds still belongs to the county treasury, and payment procedures are still overseen by the county accounting director.

It is rumored that they will make a final performance in the final battle. Hua Xing's new player, Chuan Jinsheng, also failed to arrive in time due to a delayed departure date. In yesterday's game, Hua Xing's momentum was exceptionally strong in the first half, sweeping through the opponents and taking a ten-point lead with a score of 22 to 12. In the second half, the American team fought back and even surpassed them at one point. Fortunately, Bao Songyuan's two shots allowed Hua Xing to win by a narrow one-point margin in a thrilling match. The final result was 33 to 32. It was a dangerous victory. This competition adopts a two-out-of-three system. Now that Hua Xing has won two consecutive games, the large silver cup donated by Ms. Lu Wenyin has been permanently won by Hua Xing.

<h3>Food: Rice Speculation Slightly Subdued, Rice Prices Fall Slightly by Four to Five Yuan</h3>
<p>No. 1 Saigon Opens at Eighty-Three Four Yuan, More Than 18,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>Since a large number of futures goods arrived in the rice market this month, people were uneasy and rushed to sell the goods they were holding. In an environment of abundant goods and weak sales, repeated declines were seen. Yesterday, after the holiday, the market resumed, and the sellers became more willing to sell as the source of goods became more abundant. The market was filled with goods, and the sellers competed to sell them. The sales market, on the other hand, lacked speculative transactions and relied on some actual sales from local stores. The sales channels were stable, and the transactions were limited, resulting in an oversupply. In the past, sellers hoarded goods, but now, due to the unified planning of foreign prices and the continuous flow of sources, and the fact that 600,000 to 700,000 bags have been successfully ordered before and after, they have to sell in groups at the end of the year, fearing that the market will be difficult to support and suffer losses. Therefore, floating households devalued their prices, and foreign merchants sold them cheaply, allowing the market to suffer huge reactions. After the market opened, it fell all the way until the close, and the prices fell by three, four, or five yuan compared with the previous week. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is only 84-5 yuan to 83.5 yuan, No. 2 is 79 yuan, all the way down to 77 yuan, No. 1 Chen Siamese is 81.5 yuan, new is 83 yuan, No. 2 is 76-7 yuan, Huo Jiao is 83 yuan, down to 80 yuan, Xiaowen is 71.5 yuan, 71 yuan, down to 70 yuan in the afternoon, Mi Lu is 67 yuan, broken tip is 64 yuan, down to 56</p>
<p>Although the domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice also has poor sales channels, it is easier to support the market because the arrival of goods is limited. The decline is not as strong as that of foreign rice, with only a decrease of one or two yuan. If Kunshan Hu sees white japonica rice at 100 yuan to 97 yuan, Wuxi special japonica rice is 102 yuan, and Qingjiao Hu sees thin rice at 97.5 yuan and 97 yuan, the original package is 101 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is still unusually deserted. Transactions are rare, and the owners have no intention of selling in a hurry, so although the situation is sluggish, the prices have not changed. Yili white yuan opens at 91-2 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan is high from 80 yuan and 30 cents to 77 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has a strong source. Taikoo Company's Anshun ship arrived in port on the 12th (the day before yesterday) with 5,239 bags from Hong Kong, and the company's Hanyang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday with 13,494 bags from Hong Kong. The two ships carried a total of 18,733 bags. 9,300 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai today. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Downstream Factors in the Flour Market: Continuous Source, Sold More</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market went downstream again. It was found that the supply of foreign flour in the market has gradually become more and more. On the sales side, the local customers lack a good appetite. Although the flat-sale flour in the street is insufficient, the shortage is very small. In addition, the sharp drop in the rice market has softened everyone's hearts. Most of the holders are selling, and there are few entrants. The whole market only opened 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Australian flour under the Flower and Clock Tower brand, priced at 23 yuan and 80 cents to 70 cents, and 1,500 bags of Maihua brand foreign flour newly shipped from Hong Kong, priced at 22 yuan and 60 cents. The market situation in the future is even weaker, and the price is reduced by another one or two yuan. The flour from this factory is still 21 yuan and 50 cents, supplied by two factories for about 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign flour: There are still continuous arrivals in Shanghai. Taikoo Company's Anshun and Hanyang ships, in addition to carrying a large amount of foreign rice, also carried a lot of flour from Hong Kong. It is estimated that the Anshun ship carried 2,000 bags and the Hanyang ship carried 5,000 bags, totaling 7,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market situation yesterday did not have any special entries and exits, because the amount of deposits is small, and it is not easy for each flour mill to purchase. However, in the midst of the downstream prices of flour, the appetite has also been invisibly slackened. It is said that the Japanese factory's door market price is still 31 yuan, and only two to three hundred bags are collected. There is no news of market transactions.</p>
<h3>Finance Foreign Firms Eager to Acquire Sterling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC quotes unchanged. The unofficial Sterling-Dollar exchange rate initially showed some signs of easing.

Korean notes saw similar supply and demand, and the evening market remained at 1.19 dollars.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Trend Remains Firmly Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market "烚赤" unofficial market went from decline to rise. After falling below the 6400-dollar mark, it immediately rebounded. Various parties were agitated by rumors, and the foreign exchange market often showed a soft trend. However, today, from 1 PM to 2 PM, was the rollover date from January to February, and it was reported that buyers had to pay sellers around 80 dollars, which inevitably affected buying momentum. Therefore, with the buying momentum of 同康, 賣康, 公和, 義豐, 新豐, and 大德成, 祥和 and 一利德孚 silver firms helped with sales. Although the price rose from 6370 dollars to 6445 dollars, many deals along the way did not last long and soon fell back. Finally, it slightly retreated to 6425 dollars, an increase of 22 dollars. Based on the evening closing price of 5.53125 for the one-month US Dollar, it was still 6316 dollars, an increase of 109 dollars. The total trading volume for the day was 7-8,000 taels.

Customs Gold and other items remained stable.</p>
<p>"烚赤" Currency Initially Weak, Then Returned to Firmness</p>
<p>In the morning, with HSBC and other British banks selling Sterling in the foreign exchange market, the US Dollar price showed a hardening trend. Buying interest on the surface was weak. The opening price was three dollars lower than last Saturday's close, at 6400 dollars. Soon, it was reported that new short positions were being sold off, and it fell below the 400-dollar mark. It was reported that silver firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, at 6370 dollars. Later, because the trend in the foreign exchange market stabilized, small money shops, securities firms, and others came to buy, and the price gradually rose. Before long, money changers bought 20 taels from silver firms, and it had risen to 6440 dollars. At this time, gold and silver firms sold again, and it fell by several tens of dollars.

<h3>Securities Domestic Bonds Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial trading of Unified Public Bonds saw ups and downs, fluctuating between 0.35 and 0.89 dollars.

<p>(1) Those outside the industry who hold large amounts of legal tender all consider hoarding goods as a solid and stable strategy; (2) Fixed arrivals are extremely rare, and the inventory is lacking. However, most of them are still cheaper than in June and July. In terms of business, although the transaction volume is larger than in previous years, it is actually less profitable because the previous goods were priced low, and the current goods are priced high. The logic is very clear. Because the Japanese control has intensified, the export of woolen goods must have a "removal permit" and "entry permit." Passenger transport has become even more difficult, and there is a shortage of goods in other ports. For example, in Nanjing and Ningbo, the price of woolen goods is, compared with Shanghai, on average different by a small fraction up to one or two times. Therefore, transportation is slightly more convenient, such as Nanjing, and generally doing single round trips has greatly increased. In addition to the trend of commercial situation, unexpected special news occurred in the middle of the quarter, more than in previous years. Also, because the price of all goods rises endlessly and the cost of living rises, the salaried class feels great pain. Dyehouse workers went on strike, followed by West clothing factory employees from the Fourth Avenue and Daxin Street. Soon after, 紅　tailors on Avenue Joffre went on strike. After communication, clothing workers in Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Sichuan Road went on strike. The result was nothing more than an increase in wages: 70% for those below three dollars, 60% for those above four dollars, 50% for those above five dollars, and 40% for those above six dollars. Then, the Shilu clothing shop workers went on strike. In the end, the purchasing power of woolen goods was more reduced than in the first half of the year. More high-end customers gradually became middle-class, and middle-class customers turned to buying lower-end goods, so the outlet for lower-end 10-20 dollar per yard and 3-4 dollar per foot woolen goods suddenly became active. In order to cater to the psychology of customers, the domestically produced goods from Shanghai Textile Factory were particularly popular in production and sales. Filler goods with more cotton and less wool, such as rainproof cloth, filled shoe flannel, fake straight-line, and cotton camel hair, flooded the market. Now, the prices of woolen goods in the four seasons of the 29th year are compiled below.</p>
<p>(Note) ... represents no market for falling orders Unit: Legal tender yuan Current wholesale market price per yard (End)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Buying Yarn in Hope of Price Increase — People Become More Confident —</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very strong, and the rising trend has resumed. This is because the general situation has been hovering for many days, and the downward trend can temporarily stop. Therefore, speculators simply go long, so you buy and I buy, the surface tightens, and the market price immediately rises. At the same time, the Hong Kong gang slightly acquired a few packages of cheap two-three count yarn, and people became more confident. However, colored yarn is still 150 yuan cheaper than Shuangma, and some have already been acquired, so the trend is also rising. The high price for 20-count Shuangma is 1402 yuan, and the low price is 1366 yuan. In the afternoon, it was traded at 1407-8 yuan, and then at 1402 yuan. Someone sold.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning with a relatively peaceful momentum, and people's hearts were still stable. The first plate price was 1372 yuan, and gradually it fell to 1366 yuan. But as the price fell, rumors in the market suddenly became fierce, that some news was favorable to the bulls. However, the foreign exchange rate was still quiet, but buyers still seemed to swarm, so the market immediately moved forward, and the rising force was very strong, directly out of the 1400-yuan mark. Those who profited along the way settled, and then into 400 yuan, for 1395 yuan. The closing price was 1399 yuan. A total of 6,045 packages were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 29 yuan. Also, 133 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows: 5,400 from 同行, 570 from 香港, 75 from 宁波 Total 6,045</p>
<h3>Factory Side Buys Spot Cotton Market Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is slightly firmer, because Shenxin No. 29 Factory has recently released a huge amount of cotton yarn, and the raw materials have been slightly supplemented, so there are more transactions and the market is firmer. However, overseas-priced Indian cotton is very cheap. The price of 米特林 is 316 yuan, the price of 惠司登 is 256 yuan, and the price of Brazilian cotton is 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Another message says that the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, initially rose because of purchases by peers, and then because of sales by Wall Street, the latter part of the bulls ended, and the result was that the closing price fell 24 pounds of sound compared with the previous day. India is expected to fall by more than two rupees.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, the cotton market has also turned lively in recent days because of the high price of yarn. However, because the factory side's intake is relatively stagnant, there has been no large number of transactions. However, scattered transactions are still called lively.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods The Rising Trend of Cotton Cloth Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday's factory cloth market trend was firmer, and the thinking of internal and external囤戶 traders was vigorous, and there was a continued momentum. 客帮 bought because the market was slick, so transactions were frequent, and the selling plate was uniformly raised. Coarse and fine cloth twills rose immediately by half a dollar per piece in the morning, and continued to rise by 0.25 to 0.5 dollars in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by about 0.5 dollars per piece. Nearly a thousand pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The 浙皖赣帮办 color cloth coarse and fine cloth were more than two hundred pieces, and the 粤港帮办 bleached and dyed cloth coarse cloth twill and other more than three hundred pieces, and the 北路烟津帮办 color cloth heavy coarse cloth one hundred and several ten pieces, and the national Singapore and other places handled bleaching cloth color oblique khaki and other six thousand several hundred pieces, and on the 14th, there were two hundred pieces of head transported to Yantai, and another sixty pieces transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The rising trend of Dongbu is very strong, because the air turns prosperous in all directions, and the internal and external purchase is more and more prosperous, and it rises step by step. The highest plate of 12-pound faucet fine cloth is 43.7 dollars, and the closing price is slightly back to 43.55 dollars, which is 1.15 dollars higher than last week, and the new single of 四君子哔叽 is 1.245 dollars, and the old single is 1.205 dollars.</p>
<h3>Oilcake Oil Market Speculation Eager to Try Qingdao Barrelled Raw Oil 135.75 Yuan</h3>
<p>The source of edible oil has recently been deliberately made mysterious by a certain party, resulting in a sudden change in arrival, although sales are not smooth, but a part of the oil market speculation is eager to try, so the market in the imperceptible step towards a new peak. Yesterday, Qingdao barreled raw oil actually created an unprecedented record of 135.75 yuan, up three yuan sharper than before, and the rest also rose by one or two yuan, and a total of 130 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 200 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, 130 cans of Yantai raw oil, 100 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, and 100 pieces of the first phase of February were sold. In addition, 200 barrels of Dachao soybean oil, and 300 barrels of the first phase of February were traded, 400担 of Dayou factory soybean oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, and 40 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Price Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat, with very little ups and downs. The association's plate, the spot price of 24 coarse white outside the stack was initially 78.3 yuan, and then returned to 78.5 yuan, with no ups and downs. The February 10th strike price was 79.1 to 0.35 yuan. The Dutch red spot price was 65 to 65.1 yuan, and 0.3 yuan, small 0.3 yuan. Taikoo Chebai B 唛 was 78.8 yuan, unchanged. HX 唛 was 76.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Woolen Industry Greatly Benefits</h3>
<p>— Recent Trading Is Very Lively —</p>
<p>In the past years, the woolen market has turned flat at this time, the trading has turned light, and it is busy taking stock, collecting accounts, and preparing for the year-end summary. This year's Geng is very different, and the entry and exit are mostly cash, less credit, and most of them have also changed to the Gregorian calendar to settle accounts. All major and small numbers, in the 29th year, have made great profits, which is rare since the woolen industry. The funds on hand are abundant, and the inventory is lacking, but they are searching for each other and hoarding goods, so the woolen trading is particularly lively.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Dried Lily Bud Price Rising Greatly</h3>
<p>Because the inventory of lily buds is becoming increasingly scarce, the market situation is becoming increasingly tight, and the price is gradually rising. Yesterday's number plate price rose greatly, with the top village dishes opening to 140 yuan, up 13 yuan, followed by 128 yuan to 125 yuan, and the ordinary 110 yuan. If the spring market goes smoothly, it is still expected to continue to rise.</p>

<h3>British Tram Company Will Increase Prices Again Various Circles Hope To Cancel Original Proposal Related To Work Efficiency Of All Industries In The City Most Citizens Have No Affordability The Implementation Period Still Awaits The Authorities To Review And Withdraw Their Decision</h3>
<p>The British Tram Company of Shanghai Public Concession in this port, citing reasons such as tight foreign exchange and increased expenses, submitted a request to the Public Works Department to increase the fare by another 35%. This request has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department on the 8th and decided to be implemented on all tram and trolleybus lines in the Public Concession area from the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>The Authorities Approved The City Felt Heartbreak</p>
<p>Since learning of the news, the residents of this city have been deeply saddened by the approval of the request by the Public Works Department. Since autumn last year, the prices of all goods have risen month by month, reaching a peak in December, posing a serious threat to the citizens. Since the beginning of this year, prices have not fallen, so the lives of civilians still feel extremely difficult. Tram and automobile are the main departments of public services, and they are closely related to the prosperity of the entire business and the welfare of citizens, and the work efficiency of all employees in the city.</p>
<p>Repeated Price Increases Go Against Principles</p>
<p>In addition, the fare has already increased once in September last year, and it has not been a few days since then, and another price increase is heard, which violates the purpose of public utilities. Since Shanghai's deformed development, the population has increased sharply, almost doubling. Although various businesses show a strong exterior but empty interior phenomenon, the various means of transportation are very developed, and the prosperity of the business is far from comparable to before the incident.</p>
<p>Salaried Class Difficult To Bear</p>
<p>Therefore, the amount of surplus is amazing, and the raw materials used by the company are mostly ordered several years ago, although the price has risen today, but only a part of it does not contain "absolute" nature. All sectors of the community in this port believe that since the implementation period is still ten days away, there is ample time to review. It is hoped that the authorities will take into account the plight of the citizens at this time and in this place and withdraw the decision to increase prices. The largest customers of trams are all the salary class of the middle and lower classes. Their monthly income is meager, and they usually save on food and clothing. They cannot even provide warmth for their families, and it is a fact that another sudden increase in expenditure is not allowed.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador's Wife Left For Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The wife of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and Sir Victor Sassoon, owner of Sassoon and Co., left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday on the China Mail Steamship Company's new steamship Chitralenka. It is heard that many foreign merchants and banking tycoons in this city also boarded the Chitralenka steamship for Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Postpones Return To Shanghai Ordered To Go To Vietnam Related To Thai-Vietnamese Conflict The Public Believe The Mission Is Extremely Important</h3>
<p>The French Ambassador, Henri Cosme, since arriving in Hong Kong from Chongqing at the end of last year, originally planned to leave Hong Kong and return to Shanghai immediately. According to a Pingming News Agency reporter, the French Ambassador suddenly changed his itinerary on the evening of the 3rd of this month, and suddenly left Hong Kong by ship late that night for Hanoi to meet with General Peng Gu, the Governor of Vietnam. After arriving in Hanoi, he went to Saigon for official business, and the return to Shanghai was repeatedly delayed. According to reliable sources, the French Ambassador suddenly changed his itinerary because he received an order from Vichy on the evening of the 3rd of this month, ordering him to go to Vietnam. The fact that Mr. Ge left Hong Kong late that night proves the importance of his mission. The public believe that Mr. Ge's trip is related to the expanded situation of the Vietnam-Thailand conflict. According to the related parties of the French Consul General in this port, there is no definite news about the Ambassador's return to Shanghai as of yesterday afternoon, so it is difficult to return to Shanghai within a few days. It is also known that the Ambassador was accompanied by his wife and secretary when he left Chongqing this time.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Strengthen Control And Management Of Shanghai's Finance</h3>
<p>The Black Market Foreign Exchange Rate Is Maintained At A Steady Level All Banks And Firms Must Fill In Forms For Reporting And Verification</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai financial market was adjusted by the National Bank and friendly banks, and the silver and money industry, it has remained stable even during the period of general closing of various industries, making it impossible for speculators to take advantage of the situation and manipulate the market. (1) After the black market foreign exchange is maintained by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and the legitimate needs of Chinese and foreign industries are supplied as much as possible, the legal exchange rate remains unchanged, the black market stands at a natural level, and the management policy is gradually strengthened, which is very helpful to financial stability. (2)</p>
<p>Securities Market</p>
<p>Because the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it will maintain credit, and the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks have discounted and paid for the tariff-guaranteed bonds, the price has skyrocketed, creating a new post-war record. The stock price of Chinese stocks is higher than the face value because all industries have made profits and the stock prices of various national goods factories. (3) The gold and other black markets are illegal organizations, and the government has long ordered them to be banned, but those who still buy and sell are in violation of the law, so the gold's soaring and falling is irrelevant to the entire financial situation. (4) The entire financial situation is due to the National Bank</p>
<p>Handling Discounting</p>
<p>And the adjustment of the reserve treasury of the silver and money industry. After the New Year, the various industries are becoming more stable. The foreign exchange is low and the silver roots are relaxed. The financial situation shown in this session is more stable than the previous session. Regarding the credit of legal currency, because of the financial management, it is becoming stronger. The issuance of miscellaneous banknotes does not affect the credit of legal currency. The black market price of legal currency is becoming higher. The silver and money industry association has also received an order from the Ministry of Finance to investigate the lower half of the year of the 29th year of the various banks and firms.</p>
<p>Deposit and Lending Rates</p>
<p>Including (1) Loans, credit, and mortgages, (2) Deposits, fixed-term and demand, (3) Discounting, peers, etc. It is heard that the two industries associations have complied with the order and attached a form for member banks and firms to comply with, and it is heard that the Ministry of Finance, in addition to encouraging internal migration, is planning a proper method for Shanghai's floating capital to be used for the country, and not to flow into the market, for speculators to manipulate the market. At the same time, it will find ways to ban Shanghai's speculative markets, so that finance can be stable for a long time, and people's lives can be stable.</p>
<p>Refusing to Use Miscellaneous Banknotes</p>
<p>Dazhong News Agency said, The American Evening Post in English said, A reporter this morning (13th) held miscellaneous banknotes issued by a certain party and tried to go shopping, but shops in both the British and French concessions of this port refused to accept them. Even the Chinese merchants and British and American banks in the market also refused to accept these miscellaneous banknotes as deposits. Its future can be imagined. The main purpose of opening a certain bank is known to everyone to be the issuance of "banknotes". It is said that after the "bank" was established on the 6th, as of the 11th, it has issued a total of 6,413,927.2 yuan of "circulation notes". The cash reserve, no more and no less, also happens to be consistent with the amount issued. The reporter asked a certain gentleman in the banking industry about the possibility of this matter. It is said that since the National Government reformed the currency system, the private cash has long been collected by the government. The Southeast has achieved the best results. Gold has long been managed by the government. All gold and silver were transported by the central government to a safe zone before the war broke out. Where does the cash come from now? If it is said that the reserve of the bank is foreign exchange, it has neither obtained foreign loans, nor has it been able to control the trade in the occupied areas (now controlled by the Japanese army in Central China). Where does the foreign exchange come from? Based on the above reasons, legal currency is strong and highly trusted by the people, which also has its origins.</p>
<h3>Public Granary Management Committee Begins Operations Yesterday; Office Located on the Third Floor of the Public Works Department; Qin Runqing Appointed as Chairman</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Food and Timber Public Granary Management Committee, since holding its first committee meeting on the 7th of this month, has been actively preparing for various matters. The committee's office has now been decided to be located in Room 265, on the third floor of the Public Works Department on Jiangxi Road. Work commenced yesterday. Mr. Qin Runqing, a leader in the banking industry, was recommended by the first committee meeting to serve as chairman. After the meeting, the chairman and vice-chairmen of the committee, He Dekui and Xu Jiyin, jointly obtained Mr. Qin's consent. He reported to the office yesterday. Simultaneously, Mr. Yan Esheng, secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was also hired to concurrently serve as the committee's secretary. Yesterday (the 13th) at 10 a.m., Chairman He Dekui, Vice-Chairman Xu Jiyin, Treasurer Xi Yushu, Chairman Qin Runqing, Secretary Yan Esheng, and others held a meeting in the Public Works Department conference room to discuss all operational procedures in great detail. It is also reported that various industries are separately urging the collection of rice subscriptions, preparing to pay 50% before the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Prices Plunge Yesterday</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that reports had arrived in Shanghai from the origins of imported rice, such as Saigon, Siam, Rangoon, and the transportation hub of Hong Kong, indicating that rice prices in various markets had fallen. Consequently, prices of imported rice in local markets plummeted by around three yuan per stone yesterday. Siamese No. 1 rice fell from 88 yuan to 85 yuan per stone, which is four yuan lower than the ceiling price of 89 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rice fell from 87 yuan to 84 yuan per stone. The decline in Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice was even more significant, continuing to fall sharply by four yuan yesterday. Therefore, the prices of various domestic rice types also declined by over one yuan. It was also learned that Hong Kong rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday: (1) 6,700 bags on the "An Shun" vessel; (2) 13,494 bags on the "Hanyang" vessel.</p>
<p>Consequences of Inflated Rice Prices</p>
<p>On Friday, a certain rice merchant sold over one hundred bags of glutinous rice to a distillery on Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. As four trucks were unloading the goods at the distillery, over one hundred impoverished people from Jiangbei suddenly arrived, armed with small knives. They cut open the burlap sacks and used prepared rice-washing baskets and flour bags to seize the glutinous rice. The distillery and the rice unloading workers were unable to stop them. They reported to the responsible police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to suppress the situation, dispersing the impoverished people. However, the losses were significant, with about ten or more stones of rice stolen. This is purely the consequence of rice merchants inflating rice prices.</p>
<h3>Successor to Japanese Deputy Director-General Recommended by Japanese Consul; Ibusuki to Resign at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>Hirohide Ibusuki, the Japanese Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, has decided to resign at the end of next month. According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency, regarding the selection of a successor, the Japanese Consul-General has already recommended a candidate to the Public Works Department. The candidate has been decided, but neither the Public Works Department nor the Japanese Consul wants to announce it yet. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, Ibusuki's resignation is due to his inability to fully comply with the Japanese side's wishes in his work, thus necessitating his departure. Therefore, the successor will be recommended by the Japanese Consulate. However, according to the Public Works Department's long-standing administrative practice, all matters of the Public Works Department must be decided by the Board of Directors and the Consular Body, and the Director-General is the one who executes the orders. The Japanese Deputy Director-General can only handle matters concerning Japanese residents, but even then, it must be approved by the Director-General.</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; Ferryboat at Haiyan; Nearly One Hundred Innocent Civilians Killed; Charitable Organizations Appeal to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to reports just received here yesterday, on the 6th of this month, several ferryboats traveling from Haiyan in southern Jiangsu to northern Zhejiang were subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft. Approximately ninety people were killed at the time, and three or four ferryboats sank. Almost none of the passengers or crew survived. Industry sources point out that since the Zhejiang coast was blockaded by the Japanese, Haiyan has become the main transportation hub between Shanghai and Ningbo. Those traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo first go by land to Haiyan and then take a ferryboat across Hangzhou Bay to northern Zhejiang. This transportation route has not been disrupted for several months. However, earlier this month, Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the area without prior warning. The ferryboats at Haiyan have now ceased operations. The victims this time were all Ningbo natives, so the local charitable organizations have appealed to the Ningbo Shanghai Association for assistance.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou-Line Foreign Vessel Uncertain About Resumption</h3>
<p>The British merchant vessel "Wing Tai," which sails opposite the "Yong Feng" vessel on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, returned to Shanghai from Fujian yesterday and docked at the 16th Wharf to unload cargo. According to the Fushun Company, the agent for the vessel, the "Wing Tai's" continued sailing to Fuzhou has not been decided. This is because the navigation on that line is severely monitored by Japanese warships, causing various delays and increasing unnecessary losses, which is uneconomical. The resumption of sailing will be determined based on the situation. Currently, after the "Fu Yong" and "Yong Feng" vessels were obstructed, the "Wing Tai" vessel is the only remaining one on the Shanghai-Fujian line. If this vessel also ceases operations, the Shanghai-Fujian line will be in a state of disruption.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong to Implement Import Restrictions Starting Today; Cash Deposit Determined by Cabin Class; Refundable Upon Arrival with Receipt</h3>
<p>The population import restrictions promulgated by the British authorities in Hong Kong to prevent undesirable elements from entering will take effect today. From today onwards, travelers going to Hong Kong from Shanghai must have a passport issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to be allowed to disembark. British shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Navigation Company, have already notified passengers going to Hong Kong to prepare the aforementioned certificates in order to avoid difficulties upon arrival. However, those without certificates can provide a cash deposit, which varies depending on the cabin class. Those purchasing first-class tickets must pay HK$100, cabin class HK$50, and deck class and steerage class HK$25. The shipping company will issue a receipt, which can be used to claim a refund of the deposit upon arrival in Hong Kong. As for passports, the various shipping companies and China Travel Service can also apply on behalf of passengers, requiring a fee of HK$5 and two personal photos, which can be collected in about two weeks. Furthermore, Taikoo Shipping Company has notified passengers going to Hong Kong that vaccination certificates must be at least two weeks old to be valid.</p>
<p>Vessels Sailing to Hong Kong to be Inspected</p>
<p>According to China Travel Service, the Jardine Matheson Company's "Yusheng" vessel, which sailed from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 11th of this month, will arrive in Hong Kong today. According to the new regulations, it will be inspected by the Hong Kong authorities. Most of the passengers on board did not have time to complete the visa procedures before departure. They only paid a deposit of HK$20 to the shipping company when purchasing their tickets, in addition to various import guarantees. However, this change in procedure is actually due to the recent trips to Hong Kong by vessels from China Navigation Company, Taikoo, and Jardine Matheson, where passengers did not have time to complete the procedures. Therefore, it will soon be abolished. In the future, travelers going to Hong Kong will still need to have a visa. The company is currently issuing forms for applying for a visa from the Immigration Department. Upon collection, a guarantor must first be secured, and after approval, it will be issued. After completion, the company will forward it to the Hong Kong branch for guarantee to the Immigration Department to apply for a certificate issued by the Immigration Department.</p>

<h3>Negotiations to Lift Zhejiang Coastal "Blockade" Underway; Results Expected Within Two Weeks; Tugboats Diverted to Downstream Yangtze Ports</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that representatives of Shanghai shipowners are currently in negotiations with the relevant Japanese authorities in hopes of easing restrictions on shipping. If these negotiations conclude successfully in the near future, as some in the shipping industry expect, the naval blockade of nearby coastal ports will be partially lifted, allowing supplies to be transported into some Chinese-controlled areas. As the Japanese authorities are determined to enforce the ban at any cost, some shipowners have suggested:</p>
<p>Foreign Vessels to be Leased to Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>To continue coastal trade, it is heard that this plan has been approved by Japanese lessees. However, the question is how Japanese-leased ships can be allowed to enter waters controlled by the Chinese military, such as Wenzhou. To overcome this difficulty, shipowner representatives are also in discussions. According to some shipowners, negotiations may yield results, with some in the shipping industry yesterday (the 12th) predicting that discussions could conclude within two weeks. It is heard that this discussion is particularly:</p>
<p>Limited to Ports in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>At the same time, tugboats flying foreign flags, which used to operate along the Chinese coast, are now operating between Shanghai and the downstream Yangtze River and areas outside Jiangsu. As the saying goes, "Necessity is the mother of invention." The coastal industry has proven this. Since the Japanese naval authorities implemented the shipping ban in July of last year, the once-thriving shipping industry has plummeted. Although shipowners have tried to reach a compromise with the Japanese, the Japanese have firmly continued the ban, resulting in the complete stagnation of coastal shipping. Vessels are idle, and shipowners and lessees are incurring significant losses. Therefore, there is no shortage of those who send ships on roundabout routes, even risking being seized, to continue their service. The reason shipowners:</p>
<p>Risk Sending Ships to Navigate</p>
<p>Is primarily motivated by the high freight rates to ports such as Wenzhou. Many ships have repeatedly attempted to take risks, resulting in their seizure by the Japanese authorities. It was not until the shipowners and consular representatives negotiated with the Japanese authorities for a long time that they were released. Recently, the Japanese naval authorities discovered that some ships were entering ports at night, taking advantage of Japanese unpreparedness, and mooring overnight to unload cargo. The Japanese then sent troops to board some ships entering late at night or early in the morning and confiscated all the cargo on board, putting an end to such risky attempts. Starting a month ago, shipowners, lessees, or cargo consigners were charged exorbitant "special fees" by the Japanese naval authorities to unload cargo. However, these fees were far greater than the profits earned, so many shipowners decided to completely suspend operations.</p>
<h3>Second Shipment of American Aid Medicines Arrives in Shanghai; Dr. Baker Personally Distributes Them</h3>
<p>After the first shipment of 200 tons of American Red Cross relief medicines for Chinese refugees arrived in China and was distributed, the second shipment of over one hundred large boxes of relief medicines also arrived in Shanghai on American vessels. These medicines, including various medicinal liquids, tablets, and pills, are of considerable value. Dr. Baker, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, is personally in charge of the distribution. As for the second shipment of 1,000 tons, or 40,000 bags, of wheat, it has been shipped to Shanghai on the Collinsworth vessel and is expected to arrive and be distributed by the end of next month. At a time when various charities are having difficulty organizing winter relief, the provision of rice and wheat is like a timely rain after a long drought. Furthermore, after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the American President Lines' "President Pierce" on the 6th of this month, Dr. Baker is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the "President Taft" on the 22nd to go to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to Chongqing. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Federation of Charitable Organizations, the Jisheng Society, the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee, and the Salvation Army, among others, are deeply grateful for Dr. Baker's enthusiasm in providing relief to Chinese disaster victims and have specially scheduled a welcome and farewell reception at the Hong Mian Restaurant on Edward Road on the 17th of this month to express their gratitude.</p>
<h3>Save on New Year's Gifts to Aid Refugees; Refugee Association Appeals to All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee has issued a notice to all sectors, appealing to save on New Year's expenses to aid refugees. It states that the Lunar New Year is fast approaching. In Shanghai, it is customary for relatives and friends to exchange expensive gifts, resulting in significant waste. Moreover, most of these gifts are foreign goods, which further drains our economic interests. At this time of festive celebration, there are still over 16,000 refugees in Shanghai, most of whom are elderly, weak, or disabled, and have no homes to return to. Although the number of refugees has decreased, the expenditure on relief funds has increased, making it difficult to sustain. We sincerely hope that people of all sectors will show compassion and donate their New Year's gift expenses to aid these refugees, so that we can fulfill our initial relief efforts and demonstrate our responsibility to help our fellow compatriots. If you would like to donate, please send your donations to Room 414, Xingye Building, intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, or call 18533, and we will send someone to collect them. Your kind generosity is greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Four Taxi Companies Nears Resolution; Barbers Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>The labor dispute between the Yunfei, Xiang Sheng, Tailai, and Silver four major taxi companies was originally scheduled for a final response at 10 a.m. yesterday, but due to the employers' insufficient preparation, it was postponed to 3 p.m. Four employer representatives and sixteen labor representatives gathered at the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, with Gu Bingyuan mediating for a final negotiation, hoping to salvage the situation. Both sides debated heatedly, and the meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. It is heard that the views of both sides have gradually converged. Due to time constraints, a final negotiation will be scheduled to resolve the dispute. Therefore, the labor side continued to work as usual yesterday. However, there have been no developments regarding the specific situation. Barbers at various barber shops in Shanghai began a partial strike yesterday due to their unsuccessful demands for improved treatment from their employers. It is understood that the reason for the strike is that before the war, the daily business income was split between labor and management at a ratio of 40% for labor and 60% for management. After the war, the employers claimed that business was sluggish and prices were rising, making it difficult to sustain operations. Therefore, they changed the ratio to 30% or 37.5% for labor and 70% or 72.5% for management. Since barber shops in Shanghai uniformly raised prices in mid-December of last year, the barbers have demanded that the employers restore the previous 40/60 split, but their demands have not been met, leading to the strike.</p>

Many officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and friends of the detachment attended the event. The reviewer on the grandstand was Colonel Henry, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. After the review, the White Russian Detachment officers held a reception at the detachment headquarters.

<p>Presentation of Souvenirs</p>
<p>After the speech, three Russian silver cigarette cases were presented to Colonel Henry, Major Mann, and Major Bartley, the staff officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and a small detachment flag was presented to the Chinese detachment commander, Major Chen, and other Shanghai Volunteer Corps officers. After reciprocal speeches, it was 2 p.m., and they proceeded to the dining room for a meal. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps' White Russian Detachment is the only Russian military unit in the world that is employed. It has existed for 14 years and is scheduled to be integrated into the Public Works Department Police Department this Thursday, the 16th.</p>
<p>Establishment Process</p>
<p>The White Russian Detachment was established on January 21, 1927. Most of the members were remnants of the White Russian army who fled to Shanghai after being defeated in the Russian Revolution. It was initially commanded by Captain Fomin. In 1933, the current commander, Major Ivanov, took over. Before 1932, the White Russian Detachment had only two companies. In that year, when the Japanese attacked Shanghai, the Public Works Department added the White Russian Detachment's fourth company. The members of the third company were all volunteers. Only about thirty of the original members who joined the White Russian Detachment are still serving in the detachment today, including eleven officers. The rest have mostly resigned due to age limits.</p>
<p>Future Responsibilities</p>
<p>Currently, the mission of the White Russian Detachment is to guard the Isolated Battalion barracks on Jiaozhou Road, stand guard at the Garden Bridge, the Bund wharves, and in front of the barracks. In a few days, after being incorporated into the Police Department, it will be managed by Deputy Police Commissioner Robertson. However, the commander and uniforms will remain unchanged, and its mission, in addition to guarding the Garden Bridge, may continue as before.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Opera Research Association News: Opposing the Election of a Shanghai Opera Queen</h3>
<p>Mr. Yuan, formerly of Jin Ying Radio, published a collection of Shanghai operas from across Shanghai in April of last year and launched an election for a Shanghai Opera Queen. The Shanghai Opera and Drama Research Association received letters of objection from the outside, believing that this action was initiated by the association and could belittle the personality of Shanghai opera actresses. Therefore, it issued a statement in the newspaper. Subsequently, Jin Ying Radio closed down, and the election of the Shanghai Opera Queen was halted. Nine months have passed, and advertisements have appeared in the newspapers announcing the establishment of a preparatory office for the coronation ceremony of the Shanghai Opera Queen, scheduled to hold a special Shanghai opera program on the 15th of this month, open the ballots at the Youyi Lianyi Society on the 22nd, and hold the coronation of the elected Queen on the 24th, etc. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Opera Research Association, based on the previous case, expressed its opposition.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>The Accumulators of Nature (Part 1)   Jian Nong</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, due to recent fondness for reading natural science books, I inadvertently discovered the various guises and true faces of hoarding merchants. Now, let me first draw a simple outline of them, and then prove it with scientific facts. I dare say: "The so-called hoarding merchants: their bellies are large, their skin is thick, their hands are tight, their hearts are poisonous, their nature is stingy, their vision is short, and their ability to conjure up trouble from high places is divine, so they are covered in thorns, making them difficult to touch? However..." Below the word "however," I originally intended to state the ultimate result of hoarding merchants, but this result, although already an ironclad fact in the lower animal and plant kingdoms, can it ultimately be applied to us, the superior human beings among all things? I dare not assert arbitrarily for the time being and will wait for its natural evolution to the final fact to clarify. However (another however!), according to recent reports, a former mayor has already been accused of hoarding food...</p>
<p>Large Belly</p>
<p>In the Saharan plains of Bahia Province in Brazil, South America, there is a peculiar tree called Pavanillesia. This tree is about sixty feet tall, with a slender tip and a large middle trunk, resembling a wine barrel or vase. Because it lives in arid areas with scarce rainfall and water sources, it has no choice but to absorb and hoard as much water as possible during the rainy season or from deep underground to sustain the prolonged dry season. Over time, it has swollen its trunk to this extent! On top of it sits a few sparse branches, which grow a few pitiful little leaves during the rainy season, but wither during drought, becoming completely barren! Meanwhile, on the Australian continent, there is a tree similar to the one mentioned above: its French name is Arbre-Boutcille, and its English name is Bottle-tree, which can truly be translated as "Bottle Tree." I believe that these two types of trees are the common forms of pot-bellied hoarding merchants.</p>
<p>Thick Skin</p>
<p>Plants in barren and desert areas, because of the scarcity and preciousness of water, must find ways to hoard it. Once hoarded, they fear its rapid and excessive loss due to evaporation, so they ingeniously thicken their skin, turning it into leather; fearing that this is not sufficient, they also paint a layer of glue or wax on the outside. In this way, they completely block the gateways for water evaporation, hang up a "No Through Road" sign, and can safely enjoy their hoarded goods. An excellent example is a plant called Welwitsehia Mirabilis in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Its trunk is woody and only five inches tall; it blooms around the crown, producing round, hard, small red balls. It has two enormous, leather-like leaves that are even tougher than cowhide, with the ends split into many small strips about three feet long. It uses this thick skin, which cannot be broken by swords or knives, to fight against the scorching sun and blistering heat! I believe that these leathery leaves resemble the skin of hoarding merchants, who, regardless of the ridicule of society and the sanctions of public opinion, simply present a stern face and turn a deaf ear, defying anyone to do anything about it!</p>
<p>When we see the two leathery and waxy leaves of Welwitschia lirolbilis, we can see how they preserve the hoarded items, being meticulous and unwilling to leave any gaps! It should not be excessive to compare this to the two hands of hoarding merchants, who are unwilling to easily let go of their goods until death, adding the adjective "tight" to describe them.</p>
<p>Poisonous Heart</p>
<p>Among insects, the one that most likes to hoard and is most beneficial to us is probably the honeybee that gathers nectar and makes honey. Their diligent hoarding is well known and does not need to be described at length, I am now only discussing their poisonous heart. I remember reading in the Zuo Zhuan when I was young: "Bees and wasps are poisonous, let alone a state?" I thought that the poison referred to was only the sting on their tail. I never imagined that after studying their way of life, I would understand that their hearts are especially vicious. According to Thomson's Outline of Science, the hive of bees, because of hoarding, fearing that they cannot enjoy their hoarded goods alone in winter, engage in the killing of their own kind: "...Once the order is issued that those who do not work shall not eat or live, the slaughter of the male bees begins: the hardworking female bees bravely and ruthlessly kill all the male bees." In this case, isn't the heart of the bee poisonous? Hoarding merchants, only caring about their own interests, allow countless compatriots to die of hunger and cold due to their own sins, not only do they not feel any compassion or pity, but they intensify their killing work. What are their hearts made of?</p>
<p>The Same Tune Played Differently   KK</p>
<p>The Sorrow of Being a Younger Brother in the Family   Liao Liao</p>
<p>The north wind is blowing outside the window, and the wires are constantly whistling. Inside the room, however, the stove is burning, strangely warm, and the mercury column on the thermometer rises high.</p>
<p>Yet, the younger brother still feels cold, the cold clock ticks with cold steps, cold tears drip on the cold little face, lonely and cold time, ah, the younger brother sits on the cold chair and cries.</p>
<p>The crying is lonely, not like the crying of a six-year-old child. Tears stream down from the corners of his eyes, creating many small streams on his face, the small streams surge down, and the table is like a rainy day road.</p>
<p>Looking around, it is still the same old thing: a bright dressing table, a glowing red stove, a nude portrait on the wall, a pile of worn-out leather shoes under the table, messy coats on the coat rack... There is nothing fun, nothing new, everything is dozing off, and the younger brother begins to yawn too.</p>
<p>But the loud laughter of the maid and the cook downstairs awakens his hazy memory, and he remembers what his mother said before leaving: "Ah Nan, take good care of the house, don't let the maids and cooks come upstairs, be careful they steal everything. When Mom comes back with the banknotes at night, she will surely give you milk candies." The younger brother's eyes open wider and wider, and he sees the annoying furniture around him again.</p>
<p>"Bang!" The younger brother is startled, the door is rudely pushed open, and his father comes in, his face red, his brows furrowed.</p>
<p>"Dad!" The younger brother calls timidly, but receives only a muffled "hm" sound.</p>
<p>Picking up the telephone receiver, his father asks tensely:</p>
<p>"Hello, ... what is the market like now? ... Hm? Sniff!" After putting down the receiver, his father's face becomes even gloomier, he puts on his coat and steps out quickly.</p>
<p>The younger brother, his mind finally settled, sits blankly, suddenly the door opens again, and his elder brother runs in with a gaudily dressed woman.</p>
<p>"Better hurry, Xiao Li and the others are anxiously waiting at the Paramount."</p>
<p>"Uh, of course, I'll take some money and go." The elder brother rummages through his mother's leather suitcase, pulls out a large stack of banknotes, and then leaves with the woman in his arms...</p>
<p>Quietly, quietly, the younger brother becomes lonely again, looking at the annoying surroundings, and a sudden chill overcomes him, although the stove is still burning red.</p>
<p>It's late, he swallows a few balls of rice alone, and then climbs into bed alone, still feeling cold and lonely in his dreams...</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange noise awakens him, it turns out to be his mother's crying, mixed with his father's angry scolding, and his elder brother's high-pitched singing coming from the next room.</p>
<p>Begonia   Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Hey, eldest brother, do you want a candied hawthorn?" Zhao Yukun suddenly scurries in like a mouse, jumps with both legs, throws off the cotton shoes on his feet, and flips twice onto the pit, holding a string of candied hawthorns in each hand.</p>
<p>He throws one string to Yuhua, while pretending to throw the other string to Yuqin, but only makes an empty gesture, instead putting it into his own mouth.</p>
<p>"I'll share it with you!" Yuhua says to Yuqin with a smile.</p>
<p>"I can't be the host and not eat myself!" Yukun says shamelessly, making a funny face at the same time.</p>
<p>The eldest and third brothers laugh.</p>
<p>"Second brother, the money the master gave you for snacks, I see you never have enough to spend, right?" Yuhua asks, biting off a candied hawthorn.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't steal from you, would I!" Yukun lies down straight on his back, facing the roof tiles.</p>
<p>"Good brother, don't keep talking to me!" Yukun leaps up, performs a carp flip, and stands up silently. "Be careful if the master finds out, he'll tell me not to think about sneaking out at night anymore..."</p>
<p>The three were talking spiritedly when suddenly a long, horse-faced face peers in from outside the door, it is Mr. Yu, who is in charge of supervising them in the lodging.</p>
<p>"Everyone, go to the east courtyard! The people delivering the leather hats are here."</p>
<p>Yuhua immediately throws away the candied hawthorn in his hand and strides out. Yukun is also busy jumping down from the pit; only Yuqin feels very hesitant, like a prisoner about to go to court.</p>
<p>"Second brother," he whispers in Yukun's ear as they walk towards the entrance of the east courtyard, "You go and stand close to the eldest brother. If he is about to lose his temper, you must stop him."</p>
<p>"I understand!" The second brother answers with confusion.</p>
<p>Ninety-odd students, all dressed alike, stand neatly in four rows, all looking very excited, secretly guessing the quality of the gifts they are about to receive; only Yuhua and Yuqin have different feelings in their hearts.</p>
<p>(8) A Striving Outlook on Life (7)</p>
<p>Hope is shattered due to insufficient and improper struggle. Struggle is not an ordinary thing, one must use one's ability, exert one's ability, and use it skillfully. Then, what was once a dead end will now be a new opportunity. In short, hope always exists and will not truly disappear. Shattering is like disappearing, but it has never truly disappeared.</p>

<p>Norma Shearer in Retirement   Si Hua</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, the leading actress in famous films such as "The Divorcee" and "A Free Soul," retired for a period after her husband's death. "Women" was her first work to change her style when she made a comeback, but she faded into obscurity again after its release and retired once more. American Outlook magazine recently published an interview with her, excerpts of which are translated below for readers who love movies. It seems that there are two Norma Shearers, one from Montreal, a famous city in Canada, who embraced her ambition and entered the film industry, struggling with the environment. Fortunately, she was not rejected. The other is married to Irving Thalberg, the once-prominent MGM mogul. The first film contract she signed after entering the film industry was signed by him. He created Norma Shearer as the most happy and successful wife, mother, and actress in Hollywood. In 1936, Irving Thalberg passed away, and she temporarily withdrew from the film industry.</p>
<p>In 1938, Norma Shearer returned to the screen, and rumors arose about her position. At the same time, people speculated about the reorganization of MGM's core. Although this caused her displeasure, it was not enough to hurt her. What ordinary actresses could not cope with, the mistress of MGM solved without any problems.</p>
<p>A photographer from Outlook magazine recently conducted a lifestyle interview with her and discovered that she was like an uninhibited child when she was at home, preparing to climb a tree. When she was photographed, every pose was beautiful and lovely, without any request or manipulation from the reporter. Her residence is built in Monica, California, facing the Pacific Ocean, and is a famous scenic spot. Her swimming pool is arguably the largest in the area. A small boat is provided in the pool, and she often rows in it. At one end of the pool, there is another children's play area, similar in size, but the water is only deep enough for a five-year-old child to stand up. This is specially designed for her five-year-old daughter, Katherine, and her eleven-year-old son, Irving. The layout of her lounge, study, and bedroom is truly elegant and appropriate, without any flaws. She only changed a few small things from what Irving Thalberg and she displayed when they built this new house eleven years ago, while still maintaining most of the original state. In addition to hiring eight servants to clean the house and grounds, she only has a private maid, a secretary, and a tutor, unlike the luxurious households of other wealthy women with rows of maids and clouds of servants.</p>
<p>Her study contains three Oscar statues, two of which were won by her husband. Some stars use Oscar statues as bathroom door decorations, but she cherishes them very much. On the table is a photo of her and her husband, and on another table is a portrait of George Raft (she is no longer reunited with Raft). Her daughter is named Katherine to admire the famous actor Cornell, and her son is named Irving because the child hopes to succeed like his respected father in his memory when he grows up. The reporter requested to take pictures of the children, but was not allowed, because the children belong to Mrs. Irving Thalberg and not Miss Norma Shearer!</p>

<p>After the agreement, Muzhai exhausted all means to gather five thousand taels of silver and handed it to Liu Rushi to take away. He said, "It's not that I am unwilling to open my purse generously, but I really don't have any savings. You know that completely. Please tell Yuqi that I, Qian, have done my best. Please ask him to launch the uprising properly and never act rashly, lest he bring disaster upon himself." Liu Rushi also gathered all the jewelry and private savings in her dowry, amounting to ten thousand gold, and hid it in her luggage. She disguised herself as a man, quietly bid farewell to Muzhai, and set off with Shi Da. The gloomy Qian Muzhai had to marvel at the courage and enthusiasm of Hedong Jun. Liu Rushi followed Shi Da, first took a small boat to Jiangyin, and then to the riverbank, boarded the seagoing ship Shi Da had sailed over, and set off from the mouth of the Yangtze River. Although she was carrying gold and silver, she was not afraid because she had Shi Da's protection. The seagoing ship sailed past Chongming and approached a small island in Zhejiang Province when they encountered Huang Yuqi's naval force. Liu Rushi saw sails like clouds and spears gleaming in the sun from afar, and was overjoyed. Shi Da ordered the boat to sail closer to the righteous army and inform Huang Yuqi. Huang Yuqi immediately invited Madam Liu to come aboard for a meeting. When Shi Da helped Rushi step onto the warship, the guards on both sides stood in a row, saluting. When Liu Rushi saw Yuqi, because she was dressed as a man, she bowed deeply and said, "General Huang, have you been well since we last met? I am overjoyed to see the righteous army today." Huang Yuqi, upon seeing Liu Rushi's arrival, was amazed. He hastily prepared a banquet on the ship to entertain her and inquired about Muzhai's recent situation. Rushi truthfully explained the use of the money to reward the righteous army. Although Huang Yuqi was somewhat dissatisfied with Muzhai, he saw Liu Rushi's enthusiasm for patriotism, which was rare among women, and was very respectful. Shi Da also sat beside them.</p>

<p>A person's private life must be very strict. People who live a romantic life not only waste their energy for no reason and cannot concentrate on public affairs, but also spend more money, inevitably leading to financial difficulties. All the results of indiscretion and depravity are caused by a romantic private life.</p>

<p>The Annual "Association Performance"   Wei Xiu</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai theaters, before closing for the Lunar New Year holidays, would always put on a "Association Performance" with a large combination of acting troupes as a year-end amusement; the storytelling circles also had this custom, always holding an annual "Association Performance" at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The original purpose of holding an "Association Performance" included two main functions: one was charitable, and the other was competitive.</p>
<p>Guangyu Society had long-term relief measures for the poor relatives of its members, and it also established a school to educate the children of its members. Employees usually had to extract a certain percentage of their income to donate to these charitable causes, and the income from the "Association Performance" was the main source of these funds. Because in holding an "Association Performance", the employees and theater owners were not allowed to take any fees, and all income belonged to the society, which was allocated as a fund for charitable causes.</p>
<p>The society members were usually scattered everywhere, and there were few opportunities to gather. The "Association Performance" provided an opportunity for all members to gather once a year and to compete with each other to improve their skills; while the rising stars and the previously unknown employees could often use this opportunity to show their talents. Many of the big names in Shanghai today, such as Xu Jixiang, Zhang Hongsheng, and Xia Hesheng, became famous after singing well at the "Association Performance" and were then known as big names.</p>
<p>Now, at the "Association Performance" held in Shanghai theaters, the theater owners and employees split the accounts in the same way as usual, and the activities of the theaters are always monopolized by these familiar faces. Therefore, the two original functions of charity and competition have completely disappeared; moreover, the number of acts is lengthened without limit, and the seat prices are deliberately raised, which is even closer to "profiteering."</p>
