<h3 id="c9">「意大利敵國大戰」 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>義大利的實力小足以與英希兩國抗衡，遂陷於極度窘境。在這時候，如果德國向英倫三島閃電進攻，則義國艱危可望暫時解除；如果日本向大不列顚的東方領屬乘機侵犯，則義國的艱危可望相當輕减；但是德日兩國却各有所顧忌，各有其自身的打算，未能見「義勇爲。按索最近的動嚮，德軍湧向保加利亞，美國援助並重英希，這是構成次一慕大戰的前奏；决一慕大戰戰塲即使不盡在墨索里尼統轄的義國陸海空，然義國陸海空其勢難免爲大戰最濃厚的火藥氣息所籠罩。</p>
<p>戰略不容機械式的運用，却以老生常談的隨機應變爲通則，察之歐戰，允屬信而有徵。歐戰中：德義的基本戰略是閃電進攻，速戰速決。而現在不得不拋棄這一戰略；英國方面的基本戰略要在組織及動員各屬地的人力物力，加緊對德義的海上封鎖，徐待爭取最後勝利的機運之成熟，而現在却有早期開展的希望了。豈是帷幄失算，中途更張？其主要的關鍵，在於英倫三島急速的完成其防禦，使對方閃電自始失效；又在於希臘抗戰的英勇，迭奏意外的奇功；義大利不但被希臘所挫敗，且在非洲戰爭中充分暴露了意外的弱點；於是發現了先行擊潰義大利的莫大可能性。去年夏秋之交，德義以其當時一舉而拔英倫三島的雄心，高唱着「不列顚帝國大戰」；現在則事實上答復了不是不列顚帝國大戰，却意外形成「義大利帝國大戰」了。義大利帝國的大戰，是由牠自己主動侵犯希臘時挑起。五個月來，在歐非兩大陸，及地中海，紅海兩海面，所有海陸空三方面戰鬥的過程，在義大利方面，都是一再的失敗。造成牠慘敗的第一個原因，是對於自身力量的過高估計，及對英希決心及力量估計的錯誤。當他開始侵希的時候，牠僅僅用了兩萬人，就想完成征服希臘的任務；及至遇到英希抵抗及反攻時，義方不獨增援前進不可能，甚至連固守及全師而退都不可能；兵員愈戰愈少，唯一的命運祇有連續潰退。第二個原因，是墨索里尼本人戰略的錯誤。以非洲戰事來說，爲了滿足他非洲帝國的野心，他在熱的準備以里比亞爲根據地，進攻埃及，達到蘇伊士運河，切斷英帝國的生命綫；乃將這一帶的給養及運輸軍械工具，以逼近最前綫的巴迪亞港爲集中點。及至英國駐軍大量增援，猛烈進攻，義國駐非總司令格拉齊尼將軍，曾主張急速由巴迪亞後撒，以便保持實力，在其他地方作戰，而墨索里尼却命令堅守巴迪亞一地。所以經過十九天血戰之後，巴迪亞陷落的時候，里此亞東部的義軍實際是已經大部瓦解及覆滅，而跟着杜白魯克，彭加西等要地的戰役，當然牠不能再作有力的抵抗希臘方面的情形，也很類似。當英希軍大規模反攻時，義軍總司令巴杜格里奧將軍，曾擬及早向亞爾巴尼亞的伐龍那港口退却，以便與後方呼應，而由海上增援後反攻，但墨索里尼却命令向前推進。此其結果，奪取薩羅尼加等軍港自企圖固然沒有達到，一直戰到義軍大部覆滅時爲止，殘軍不得不潰了。第三個原因，在於增援接濟的根本困難。蓋義國海軍的全力，與英國的地中海艦隊比較，亦復相形見絀；故義方既以竭力避免與英海戰爲其基本策略，又以偶爾海戰即遭慘敗而愈深示怯。地中海既被英艦所控制，亞爾巴尼亞各港更受英機劇炸，義國在歐非兩戰塲於是皆陷於後援不繼的狀態了。其間允顯明的事例，有如非洲方面的義國機械化部隊因汽油恐慌而失却效用。</p>
<p>這一切，都令英國增加了勇氣，而更進一步向擊潰義大利的目標邁進。英國近來的種種表示和措置裏，處處都在指明着這一點，甚至像義國本部範圍內的熱那亞那樣義國本土的軍港，也都受到過英艦嘗試的砲擊。最近德國軍隊的大批侵人保加利亞，就正是爲了解救義大利的當前危機；而英軍目前在希臘的大舉登陸，也是爲了準備大戰。</p>
<p>到現在爲止，義國在非洲里此亞方面的重要港口，已經三去其二，剩下的僅有一個特里波里海港，距英屬馬爾他根據地祗有二百五十哩，處於直接威脅之下；所以義軍倘若不想放棄整個里比亞，則必堅守特里波里港，吾則毫無出路，就成甕中之鼇。義屬東非方面，現在英軍與阿比西尼亞土著軍配合起來，直向阿比西尼亞首都推進。義軍在這裏，一面是紅海，一面是印度洋，皆在英國的控制之下，海外援助是根本不可能的，牠的命運將決之於牠本身這個區域自給自足的支持程度。前天英國艦隊突然輸送，並配合陸軍，一舉而克服索瑪里蘭的首府波波拉，對義軍，又是一個重大的打擊。歐洲方面，為了國際的關係複雜，德軍不能由保國直下托累斯及薩羅尼加，在軸心國方面，是很大的損失，但德國陸軍迄今還能保持優勢，所以義大利在這方面，沒有什麼重大危險。但半壁堅强，能吾支撐全局，不能不保留之為絕大疑問。何况環拱義國的地中海不成為義國的金湯，反而為擁有制海權的英國之堦石；待至大戰揭慕，英希發動其主動攻勢的時候，義大利艦隊不得不被逼作戰；牠僅存的致勝希望，除本身力量竟奏神效之外，就祗有仰仗德國空軍的助力，及期待法國艦隊助義一臂之力而反英。</p>
<p>到底義大利帝國大戰這一慕怎麼開展，大概不久便有事寶爲解答。</p>

<p>重慶　中國新聞學會於今日成立、發表宣言如决、中國新聞學會之組織始於南京、基礎甫具、陷於日手、而自國府西遷以來、重慶久成報業之中心、南北報人、多輾轉入蜀、以赴國難、本市固有之報業、亦隨時勢需要、而有長足之進展、遷川大學之有新聞學系者、亦於艱苦中作育人才、有所貢獻、是以由國家宣傳事業之全局立論、重慶報人、應負責倡導、集合全國同業同志、光大南京成規、並求斯業之進步、吾人詢謀僉同、創建本會、發起籌備、數月於茲、幸賴中央宜傳部之指導、全國同業同志之贊助、得於民國三十年三月十六日開成立大會、將以精勤職務、砥勵智能、以報効抗建於萬一、茲當發　伊始、謹本同人公意、掬其悃誠而宜言曰、我國報人、與國家民族運命、特有最深遠密切之關係、故同人今日</p>
<p>首先宣布、吾儕報人、對於抗建、實負有重大責任、夙衣自勉、不敢懈怠、苟利國家、萬死不辭、回憶淸末咸同以來、滿政竄敗、外患侵陵、瓦解之勢已成、亡國之禍無日、當是時也、海丙外之志士仁人、遠承數千年歷史文化之精神、近受明末諸大儒革命思想之陶冶、招復活之魂、爲革命而奮起、其武器無他、報紙言論是也、國父孫中山先生、爲近代中國最偉大之先覺、其致力國民革命四十年、初未有武力資源之憑藉、僅賴其卓智熱情、發爲言論、訴之同胞、早年在海外、與保皇黨人言論戰鬥、苦心說服、敎化政府、爲之感動、同盟會既成、其機關報之俘報、直接爲</p>
<p>辛亥革命之指導、自民國肇造以迄先生之逝世、先生奮其精誠熱烈之言論、敎訓國人、終始弗衰、故由報人立塲論、中山先生乃中國最偉大之主筆、而革命與言論、實有不可分離之關係在也、中國自古、淸議在於民間、故處士獻議、爲一切政治運動之母、吾儕居今回顧淸末民初間、我國論壇嘗極一時之盛、中山先生以外、更有幾許先輩文人、干冒常時文字之禁令、批評淸政、灌輸新知、雖有議論純駁之不同、而其啟導民智之功勳、固應同爲後人所感念、抑我國報業之興、有與各國不同者、蓋大抵爲文人發表政見而設、並無意爲商業之經營、此種風氣、今猶遺存、民國初年、革命中挫、軍閥割據、言論界嘗</p>
<p>陷於厄運</p>
<p>而歐戰旣終、新潮勃起、新文化運動與革命思想、相輔而並行、雖其間流派繁多、不可勝論、然大抵志在發揚新知、以救中國、迨經鍛鍊陶鎔之結果、則百川匯於大海、全國定於一尊，三民主義戰勝於人心、國民革命推進於全國、回首往事、足知言論之力、關係於國家民族進步者、甚重且大也、然自近世以來、吾儕報人因文字獄而犧牲生命者、實不知其幾何人、至於弱小報業、因受政治或經濟之壓迫、辛苦經營、中道摧折者、更復不可勝數、我國文人、原有以國士自許之風、故有志靑年之欲獻身言論界者最多、然在過去半世紀、內憂外患業集之中、其能久於斯業、顯露頭角者、實極少數、大抵</p>
<p>困頓飢寒、消磨士志懷才莫伸、荏苒老死、今者吾業靑年大羣、蓋已不知爲第幾代矣、同人今日集會陪都、追懷共和締造之艱難、念及國難犧牲之壯烈、承近代言論界先輩之遺志、而自省共對歷史人羣所應負之重責、誠以爲吾儕少數報人、其雙肩担負、乃有無窮之重、何况十年國難、目擊身經、四載戰事、出生入死、當茲興亡成敗之交、惟有至誠至勇、盡忠報國、使中國得其自由平等、萬民享其樂利、然後吾儕工作、始爲告一段落，惟如是、始無負於中山先生以下近代中國先覺在天之英靈、及抗戰四年全國軍民爲國犧牲之歷史、亦惟如是、始無負於數十年來有志未成之</p>
<p>失敗同業</p>
<p>及現在與將來嚮往報業之靑年、惟如是、始能無負於在淪陷區內爲人殺害之忠良同業、如朱惺公·張似旭·邵虛白·程振章·金華亭諸先生、以及正在前後方冒險宣傳之無名英雄、此全國同業爲國效忠之志趣與覺悟者一也、志趣定矣、方法何如、夫新聞學爲現代智識之科目、源自歐美、而輸入中國、雖以學稱、作如此解釋之科學也、同人以爲中國報人、必須完成中國特有之新聞學、以應需要、西洋方法參考而巳、我國之常諺有曰、爲政不在多言、吾儕報業、亦復如是、惟有於工作中求學問、而工作之外、別無學問、今國內日報或定期刋貨、應努力改進之點固多、亦惟有在實踐中</p>
<p>求其改進</p>
<p>空談新聞學、無益也、故同人以爲必須在抗建宣傳工作中、建設中國之新聞學、集思廣益、即知即行、本會願爲全國同業同志、互助互勉、砥礪共進之、望全國同人一致參加本會、各就其固有之崗位、努力奮鬥、同時務必常藉本會以交換新知、報告狀况、以期吾道之昌明、而裨國事於萬一、今當本會成立之始、願先宜布大體工作方針、並致其希望於政府、同人願首先聲明者、新聞記者本爲自由職業之一、今日亦然、而意義有異、自日軍入侵、國危民辱、成敗興亡、匹夫有責、今日抗建之大義、即在犧牲個人一切之自由、甚至生命、以爭取國家民族之</p>
<p>自由平等</p>
<p>吾儕報人、以社會之木鐸、任民衆之先鋒、更應絕對以國家民族之利益爲利益、生命且不應自私、何况其他、是以嚴格言之、戰時之中國報人、皆爲國家之戰時宣傳工作人員、已非復承平時期自由職業者之時矣、本會同人、不論是吾在黨、對於此點、實具一致之認識、是以今後之工作方針、仍概以中宣部之指導、恪守法令、尊重紀律、以共求國家至上民族至上之共同最高利益、惟有願特別陳述者、抗建大業、至重且繁、凡國家社會一切部門之工作、均應爲報人研究批評之對象、中國大矣、而抗建工作又如此廣而覊雜、凡政府政令之推行、社會事業之興革、其效率若何、改進何從、</p>
<p>利弊安在</p>
<p>補救何術、他如政令本身之是吾合宜、執行官吏之是吾適法、此皆甚關人民之利害、即能影響國家之安危、日前恭贖蔣委員長在國民參政會開會式之致辭、剴陳大勢、訓勉國人、凡所主張、皆屬至理、本會同人、敬謹接受領袖之指示、必倡導全國軍事化、國防化、放棄陳舊之意識理論、共爲組織民族戰鬥而努力、然同時認識、苟欲抗建大業之完成、必須隨時檢討政績、宣揚民隱、考求利弊、擁護紀網、務期每一政令、皆收其效、每一人民、皆得其所、此則吾儕報人爲國爲民應有之志願、宜爲今後新聞工作實際之重心、因念自作戰軍興以來、基於軍事之必要、</p>
<p>出版事業</p>
<p>絕對受戰時制度之管理、凡我同人、絕對樂從、本無異　、惟言指導、原只限於方針、新聞限制、宜不出之機密、至於一般施政綱要、宜多加研究與批評、同人今爲此言、因念多年來各省地方官吏、大抵漠視報界應有之地位、施政不容批評、事實不欲發表、我全國地方報紙、除登載公文外、幾於完全不能施其職責、軍興以來、全國同胞、服膺軍事第一之大義、服從政令、努力抗建、然一部分官吏、未嘗不假戰時統制之名義、更杜塞民意之伸張、興思及此深感危懼、同人以爲今後國家最大使命、卽在普遍檢討政治實情、試舉戰時政治之關係重大者如兵役推行、如壯丁補訓、如</p>
<p>經濟管制</p>
<p>如交通運輸、此皆以地方政治爲基礎、而直接影響軍事之成敗、其事瑣繁、而範圍廣大、所願政府動員全國報人、予以便利、加以保障、普遍調查、據實討論、庶幾喚起民衆熱情、發掘行政積弊、此正所以振紀綱、而固國本之道也、同人凜念領袖之敎訓、深以歐洲戰敗國之覆轍爲憂、深知以我國過去數千萬年政治與社會之積弊、惟恐步此歷史後塵、倘使諱疾忌醫、粉飾爲政、良好政令不能收效、人民痛苦不能伸其意、使少數不肖官吏、反得藉口戰時、掩蓋一切、則雖有偉大公忠之領袖、與無量數愛國民衆、而抗建大業依然不能剔除嚴重之障碍何也、日人並不能亡中國、而中國之自誤、爲可異也、同人今日特爲此言、蓋鑒於軍事已奔越最險之難關、外交確見</p>
<p>有利之際</p>
<p>瞻念前途、惟有動員輿論、公開檢討、並不諱不隱、恪遵抗建綱領之正確意識、而不涉及軍機、不妨害其威信、不影響前方士氣、不揭露行政機密、使一切政令之施行狀况、及執行官吏之善惡得失、應皆聽任報紙爲公正之檢討、地方文武官吏、不得加以妨阻、吾儕本此職責、勤求智識、宣布正確民意、使吾全國民衆、能愈戰愈强、以卒達抗建勝利、國防完成之境界、抑同人以爲在此轉危爲安之新階段中、誠能如此積極革新、確實進步、本會同人、以文字勞動爲職業、以戰時宣傳爲責任、工作繁重、謹冉鄭重表示、對於爲國犧牲諸同業先烈之哀意、及對於淪陷區內一般忠良同業之敬意、同時嚴斥極少數甘爲日人作謊謬宣傳者、罪惡重大、爲全民族所不齒、但亦不能危害我國家民族於毫末、最後向蔣委員長及全軍將士致敬、並深謝中央宣傳部之指導、請求政府社會各界人士、援助本會、俾得善盡其責、謹此宣言（十六日電）</p>

<p>海上援助　認為要圖</p>
<p>華盛頓　據目前傳說美國實行　英之積極步驟、第一爲另一批超過艦齡的驅逐艦早日對英之移讓、第二爲海上武裝援助之給予、國會方面對於舊驅逐艦移助英國事言之鑿鑿、而海上援助事、則斯克和浦賀華德系報紙外交評論家西穆十亦有宣布、據謂星期六日總統發言後、美國對英之武裝援助、允其是海上援助、殆爲必有之舉、並謂據華盛頓人士之意見、英國忙於應付、不克以有效方法消除德潛艇之新危害、故美國不得不予以新方式之援助，此乃觀於總統所發「非至獨栽者完全失敗後美國不欲停止其援助」語而可知者、凡有充分資格之觀察家、皆覺舊驅逐艦與小型軍艦之移讓、僅爲暫時計畫、繼其後者將爲美海軍之干涉與美商船之轉讓云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>洋米作市更見惡化、黑市貼價愈演愈烈、蓋大戶既相率堅守、小戶趁機高抬、米市如何作適當處碑之辦法、既絲毫無動靜、人心允爲惶惑、而混水摸魚之投機份子更形推波助瀾、以期造成混亂市面、藉以多得非法利益、雖市上存到兩充、升斗民食、愈加艱難、小本米店缺米應銷、而囤虎之心如鐵、只望烽烟起、於是屢經徘徊、未嘗穿出之小絞米貼價四千元大關、昨竟被打破、每百包貼自三千七百元一躍貼至四千二百元、輾轉而又達四千三四百元、是爲邇來黑市各貨貼盤之最高峯、合之每市石須一百〇八九元至一百十一元之鉅、一號西貢每百包貼三千七百元及三千五百包暗市最高亦有達四十元之說、二號西貢則三千七百兀至三千八九百元、大絞三千八百元、高碎米之米綠亦須三千三百元、昨因汕頭幫與急需之店戶競辦、形勢更緊、午後胃轉懈、市略見平、全日交易亦加至近二萬包、價高而米質愈混、以低米雋高價、比比皆然、此誠上海民食未有之厄運也、</p>

<p>工部局規定四月二日及三日、舉行下年度新董事選舉、並限各國僑民團體、須於本月廿五日前、將候選人名單送呈當局、現爲日無多、未來局勢之發展、頗可重視、詛昨日忽盛傳英日雙方竟有妥洽說、現正進行談判成立一「君子協定」、藉以减少英董席决、而增加日董名額、但此項選舉、係根據洋涇浜地皮章程辦理、此係公共租界之根本大法、似不致容許雙方片面予以變更、</p>

<p>工部局現所採行之辦法、有半數皆可謂爲不合法、例如以宵禁言、工部局並無執行之主權、但該局爲公共安全與公共租界之爾利計、迫不獲已而施宵禁、並於宵禁時間捕人、固非常辦法也、據此、工部局亦可採行防杜米况更趨嚴重之非常辦法、工部局之行動、僅須得領事團許可、凡為市民利益而採取之行動、必得領事團贊助無疑云、</p>
<p>百老匯路　貧民搶米</p>
<p>今晨百老匯路又有貧民搶奪獨輪車所載之白米四袋事、足見米况益轉惡劣、今日米價續見高漲、公共租界當局今晨官布、明日（十九日）午後舉行董事會、討論本市米况、或將商定統制米糧投機與囤積之辦法、由工部局予以採行、</p>
<p>今日會議　殊堪重視</p>
<p>兩租界當局爲穩定米市起見、已在積極進行、籌劃有效具體辦法、惟爲鄭重起見、凡待某項辦法草定後、即須經數度之研討、務期實施後、有成效之收穫、茲鑒於一般利令智昏米蠹肆虐愈甚、米價漲無止境、故爲期早日實施有效辦法、及穩定民食起見、連日接洽繁忙異常、昨據外傳、公共租界工部局糧食小組委員會、會於昨日午後再度洽商、將所有已定穏定民食辦法提出研討、各委員聞均發表較善意見、今該項已定方案、將於今日工部局董事會例會提出從長商討、俾有所取決、</p>
<p>評價辦法　等於虛設</p>
<p>昨據大中社記者探悉、米號業公會曾推派代表、晋謁工部局會辦何德奎氏、關於目下洋米超越限價達二十餘元不論買進與鬥市零售、均感因難、請示解決辦法、何氏會允加以考慮、故今日之會議中、亦將有所決定、記者昨向上海市米糧評價會探悉、該會昨日並未舉行會議、但悉該會曾繕就報告書、呈送工部局、對執行於二月三日評定之各擋洋米價格困難之情形、有詳細之分述、但該會在米蠶猖在之時、幾等於虛設、當局苟再無新辦法指示與嚴加督率、則對於穏定米市、甚難起有效用、</p>

<h3 id="c77">美國明白表示　不惜訴諸武力　竭力援助中國制裁侵略　羅斯福對日作最後警告　英文大美晚報昨日之評論 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>英文大美晚報評論云、我人希望日本政治家、能將羅斯福總統所發表之演說詳細閱讀一過、我人更望在西伯利亞旅途中之日本外相松岡洋右、在越南沿海之日本海軍軍官、及在宜昌以南之日本陸軍軍官、亦能對羅斯福總統所發表之言論、閉目深思、加以領會、我人有此企求者、實因此舉、對該國之將來、必有所裨益也、</p>
<p>接受挑釁　不再容忍</p>
<p>羅斯福總統及其他美國領袖、於發表演說譴責侵略者時、首先指斥者必爲德國、然日人若認美國對其並無憤恨、則實屬大誤、今總統於演說中、殆已明白表示、美國決不容許日本再進一步侵略美國權益、又表示如日本繼續在馬來亞及南太平洋作跳樑之舉、則美國必將採取行動、要言之、日本若欲「惹事生非」、「自尋煩惱一、則此時當可如願以償、因美國已不復後退也、總統演詞、又無異警告日本、汝等過去、既口出大言、迭作虛聲恫嚇、欺凌弱小民族、汝等既揮拳作勢、劍拔弩張、欲圖躍躍欲試、則曷不逕來一試、然汝等終將發覺、我人今已有備無患矣、</p>
<p>對侵略者　深惡痛覺</p>
<p>總統演說所昭示者、美國敵人、決非德意志一國、凡從事侵略之軸心國家、皆美國之敵人也、日本一旦與德國相勾結、成立對抗民主國家之同盟、則美國即認日本與德義爲一邱之貉、自美國視之、對侵略者皆所深惡痛絕、決不有歐亞畛域之分、而有所岐視、日本既以笨拙之行動、陷於泥淖、則如何出此深淵、端在日本本身、若徒恃虛張聲勢、以求自拔、則其結果、必將愈陷愈深、至無可援救而後已、</p>
<p>決助中國　英勇作戰</p>
<p>吾人更重更大之希望、願日本全國人民、對總統演說、亦能一加閱讀、蓋吾人希望日本人民對下列美國情緒、能加以硏究、「吾人之令日、應使歐亞兩洲之獨裁國家、不再懷疑吾人之團結、」「納粹黨暨所有被其催眠之徒、均呼此種政治制度爲新秩序」、此種制度既不「新」、亦非「秩序」、一吾人堅決相信、當吾人之生產量、達到充足時、世界上之民主國家、將可證明獨裁者不能獲得勝利、吾人又現有多餘之每一飛機、每一其他戰鬥用具、不論新舊、吾人皆將送至國外、」「美國並非一爲綏靖派、失敗主義派、及來自後門之製造恐怖者包圍之國家、」「民主國家之敵人計算錯誤、以爲民主政治、不能調整自身、以應付戰爭世界之可怖事實、」「中國……在蔣委員長領導之下、數萬萬人作英勇偉大之抵抗、彼等今向我人呼籲、美國已告中國、將得吾人之援助矣、」「吾國將實施吾國人民之口號、成爲民主國家之兵工廠、」</p>
<p>悉力以赴　義無反顧</p>
<p>即美國國民中、亦不乏懷疑美國如何始能擊敗軸心國家者、然總統昭告彼等稱、美國將全力以赴、至擊敗軸心國而後已、至何種程度、始能將軸心國擊敗、則非所計及、美國國民已不再存懷懼之心、美國此項努力、已達最高點、此白分百之努力、決不致因犧牲過於鉅大而中止、我人實望日人聞悉總統之演說後、亦不再有任何懷疑也、</p>

<p>融五講經社第十一次講經，楊中一君講「一」各敎最高原理云：禮記中庸篇曰：「天命之謂性，率性之謂道，修道之謂敎。」又曰，「道也者，不可須臾離也；可離非道也。」蓋敎依道而立，離道則敎何存，道率性而有，非性則道何見？敎雖云五，而道惟一。知最高哲理之無不同者，爲同於「一」。說文「一」字解，「道立於一」，五經無雙之許叔重，其說信而可徵，道立於一，是「一」爲道原也，引各敎說證之。</p>
<p>儒教</p>
<p>自伏羲一畫開天，作易垂敎，列聖相傳，同闡「惟一」之旨。荀子儒效篇「百王之道，一是已。」孟子滕文公篇「夫道一而已矣，」此皆承孔子「吾道一以貫之，」「予一以貫之」說也。夫「一」果何謂者？周禮賈疏，孝經邢疏，左傳孔疏，皆謂「一者，數之始。」王弼注老，又云「一數之始而物之極也。」始者，易緯乾鑿度「易始於一」春秋元命包「陰陽之性起於一，」呂覽大樂「造於太一」，禮記禮運「本於太一，」極者，逸周書命訓解「其極一也，」故虞翻易義「太極太一也，」惠棟讀說文記「一即太極。」又按篇誘注呂覽論人·君守·過理諸高，「一，道也」其注淮南精神訓，「一謂道也，」「一者道也，」于俶眞注「道之原也，」原道注「道之門也，」鬼谷子陰符，「道者，天地之始，一其紀也，」陸佃注　冠子「一者，元氣之始，一劉歆三統曆「道據其一，」即韓非楊權篇「道無雙，故曰一也，」邵康節先天學「天在一中分迭化，人於心上起經綸，」其說剖晰詳明。又觀物外篇「心爲太極，」「道爲太極，」即古三墳「一爲太極，」夫然，性數　氣，陰陽造化，禮樂刑政，皆始於一，即皆原於道，誠哉！趙歧孟子注「定天下者，一道而已，」故中庸於三達德九經皆「所以行之者也，」爰知「一」爲哲理之原。</p>
<p>道教</p>
<p>莊子天地篇引「記曰，通於一，萬事畢，」此即承老子「抱一「「得一」之誼，易繫「貞一」，「致一」之旨。劉熙云，慮及衆物，此「一」定之也。韓伯云，「一」以貫之，不慮而盡矣。　冠子環流篇，「空之謂一，」尹知章注管子內業「一謂無也，」孟景翼論「一之謂妙，」李善文選注「妙有謂一，」與夫莊子之「未形，」淮南之「無形，」呂覽之「不可形，」郭象之「有神，」「至妙，皆即易繫之「神无方而易无體，」太玄之「幽攡萬類而不見其形。」六韜引「黃帝曰「一者，階於道，幾於神。」阮籍通老論「易謂之太極，春秋謂之元，老子謂之道。」明道語錄「其處謂之易，其理謂之道，其用謂之神，」正蒙參兩篇「一故神，」又曰「有無隱顯，神化性命，通一無二，」故知曰易，曰玄，曰道，曰神，曰妙，皆「一」體之用相異名也。</p>
<p>佛教</p>
<p>三藏法數四，「無二日一，」「不一不異，名曰一如，」敎行信證四，「法性即是眞如，眞如即是一如。」華嚴大疏鈔，「一眞法界爲玄妙體，法華經方便品「十方佛土中，惟有一乘法，惟此一事實，餘二則非眞。」勝　寶窟上本曰「一乘者，至道無二，故稱爲一。」傳心法要「一即一切，一切即一。」永嘉禪師曰，一性圓通一切性，一法徧含一切法，一月普現一切水，」蓋因果不二，能所一如，一一應化，皆攝於我佛之「一」也。</p>
<p>耶教</p>
<p>以弗所四章六節，「惟一上帝，爲衆人父，超乎萬有之上，貫乎萬有之中。」上帝亦譯曰「神，」是爲「神一論，」爲「天主惟一論，」故的翰一章，四章，十四章，以天主爲道路，爲眞理，爲生命之源。</p>
<p>回教</p>
<p>天方禮經「惟呈眞宰，獨一無相，主大生地，生人生物。」費隱經「一眞衍化，理象章陳。」道行推原經「一實萬分，人天理備。」於五功釋　獨標「性一」之旨，此耶回兩敎全知全能之主，耶易象無方無體之「神」也。</p>

<p>— 志如</p>
<p>黑暗及悶熱充滿了我的小屋中，使我感到無聊及煩惱。已經是春大了，我仍穿着厚而且硬的鋼衣，我想這也許會縮短我的生命，我幾次的要走，走出這魔窟，我不要黑暗和牢獄式的生活；我要光明，要自由，可是，我被那「儂伙」鎖住了，我就永遠不會自動，更不能出這小屋。</p>
<p>鬥開了，那「儂伙」走了進來，用一串小小的金屬物開了鎖，他就走入我的肚中，主使着我的器官，我就慢慢地爬了出來。那「儂伙」並不是一個好東西，我記得；他常常虐待我，當我飢餓的時候，他常不給飲料我吃，直到我病了，不能動了，他才狡猾地領了主人來，看了一番，那主人給他幾張花花綠的紙頭，他才給我吃一點「食物」，我才回復往常的精神而行動了。……總之，那「傢伙」並不是個好東西，今天他又來主使我出去，大約今晚沒有休息的時候了。</p>
<p>現在是一條平坦的路上飛行着，他控制着我的器官，毫不因冷風底侵襲而綏慢，更不因行人的擁擠而遲進，祇是風駛地飛奔。突　在一條橫路前，有一個瘦長的人在綏行着，那「儂伙」似　瞎了眼，仍是主使我飛一般的前進，我怕，我怕會撞上去，使那人流血！叫罷！是的，我要大叫：「走開！走開！」可是那「傢伙」似乎忘了撳我的器官。近了！近了！我的身體有些抖，我想叫，又叫不出。終於我被「傢伙」主宰着殘忍地撞了上去。那時，那「傢伙」似知道了，用粗暴的聲音叫駡，又用手撳我的器官，但是已遲了，我的叫聲不是方才所想叫的：走開！走開！而是！唉！死了唉！死了的嘆聲。主人也從沉思中驚覺，下意識的伸出頭，看了一看四周擁的人們和躺在地上——我的身旁的死人，「哦！」他對這件悲慘的血案並不害怕或寒膽，祇是淡淡地這樣哼了一聲。</p>
<p>一個穿黃衣服的人走來和主人談了幾句，主人就拿了幾張花花綠綠的紙頭得意地叫那「傢伙」主使我再爬。在主人微笑的臉上，他似乎在說：沒事！沒事！我不懂這花緣緣的紙頭的魔力竟怎樣大，那「傢伙」有了花花緣緣的紙頭，竟來限害我；那穿黃衣服的人有了花花緣緣的紙頭，竟「死人也不管」。啊，我奇怪，奇怪這花花緣緣的紙，和那些四周擁擠的人，為什麼我覺得奇怪的事　他們一點不覺得奇怪呢？他們是同類呀！我始終不明瞭生命和花花緣緣的紙頭究竟誰寶貴？</p>

<p>— 亞岳</p>
<p>平常看起報來素來只看商業新聞和影戲廣吿的張經理，這幾天却在那兒注竟到大題目了。看見人也會那麼搭上兩句：「喂！日美將要開戰了！」或「租界有點兒靠不住啦！」過後就是漢幾聲氣。</p>
<p>眞的，要是眞的日美開戰，租界靠不住，那末張經理的幾產可眞要發生大問題呢。所以，張經理於「世界大局」也特別地注意起來了。可是這幾天的大題目偏偏總是那麼一套：不是「美準備積極參戰」便是日外相謂美日難免「戰」，—這簡直是在那兒摀張經理的蛋！</p>

<p>（五）愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>他把筆鋒擱在硯台上，不住的抹着，腦海裏的思潮，像煮沸了的開水一樣的湧起來；他覺得自己應該說的話太多了，本來只想寫一封短東，實在是不够的，至少得寫一封六七張信紙的長信。他想自己學戲的經過應該是要吿訴他的，還有家裏的境况，以及他和袁家叔姪倆的交誼，也應該很坦直地寫出來；此外，他還想就對方所處的不幸的境地，表示一些熱烈的同情，最後他覺得才可以加以幾句宣洩愛意的話。</p>
<p>「……」結構似乎很完滿了，可是筆尖一落到紙上，就發生一個極大的困難，他再也想不出開端應該用什麼稱呼。</p>
<p>他眞怨恨自己方才什麼不勇敢一些，先向她探問一下，只要間明白從前她在學堂裏叫什麼名字，那末稱呼就容易了。現在要是光脫脫的來一句「夫人賜鑒」，或「女士惠鑒」，不但有些欠通，而且敎對方看了，也不免要好笑。</p>
<p>這一個問題足足耗費了二三十分鐘的沉思，最後，他才決定完全不用什麼稱呼，第一行就這樣寫：</p>
<p>「我生不幸，甫上二齡已因父喪家貧母老之故，被遺入玉振班為童伶矣。尤可痛者，師復任心所欲，責令專習旦行，以一男子而令調失敷粉，作女兒裝，誠可恥極矣！……」</p>
<p>像這樣寫下去，材料固然很多，別說六七張不成問題，就是要寫滿六七十張，大槪也不是難事；可是他想羅湘綺可願意費這麼許多的工夫看自己這一篇小傳呢？同時他還覺得與其嘮嘮叨叨的說上一大篇；而不能引起對方的興趣，還不是寫得短而精采一些的好。</p>
<p>「此次前來津沽，百無所獲，惟於困　中得睹芳顏，實私衷所不勝欣慰者也……。」</p>
<p>這一次，他決定最多以三張為度，但第一張寫了兩行，自己就覺得這樣寫下去，必然又是一個長篇了；d為旣說「不勝欣慰」，當然就得說出所以欣慰的理由來，至少也得吿訴她一些自己過去生活的枯燥，並且還少不掉要挿進一段讚美她的話；這樣一舖張開來，那裏還能收束得住？沒有奈何，祇得又把第二張信撕了。</p>

<p>但我閱此文後，感覺此喩擬於不倫。—我們知道，羣鼠抗貓之失敗，乃鼠本為害蟲，蓄貓所以滅害，亦為眞理！至於繫鈴貓足，本為鼠力之所不逮也。像囤積居奇之奸商豪吏，雖然狡猾奸險，可是，究不能謂其有何項特權，可以隨時隨地剝噬吾輩平民，吾輩更何為而自認為鼠，供彼剝噬？再者：如自認為鼠，則唯有聽受彼輩肥頭胖耳之花貓擺佈而已；如其不然，則吾人須知奸商豪吏之囤積居奇者，斷非貓之可喩；所謂平抑物價，亦不類繫鈴貓足之難，蓋為「長者折枝，非不能也，不為也。」</p>
<p>張經理開始煩惱，苦悶……</p>

<h3 id="c97">我為什麼攝「大獨裁者」 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 却利卓別麟原著拯譯自行列雜誌</p>
<p>我以為世界上最可笑的事，莫過於嘲弄身處高位的人，你所　揄的對象地位愈高，你所攝製的滑稽片成功的機會也愈多。——希特勒應該是最大的目標，在現世界中諷刺譏　的對象沒有比他再好的了。——這是我所以樂於拍攝「大獨裁者」的原因。</p>
<p>有人提出我所以拍攝此片是具有宣傳作用的，這與事實大相庭逕。我對於此類宣傳並不感覺興趣——大部分宣傳都是含有敎訓性質的，愚不可及的，我所以攝製「大獨裁者」的原因，就是為了我仇恨獨裁者，我希望引觀衆發笑。</p>
<p>假使我攝製此片除了娛樂觀衆的願望外，尙有其他動機，我敢保證決不是宣傳。</p>
<p>我與政治無緣，對於政治學並無特殊印象，但我以為我是博愛主義者，正如每一個從事藝術的人所設想的一般，我不愛看一個人或一種制度支配着一羣卑賤的，無助的人民。</p>
<p>當我開始制攝「大獨裁者」時，我並不希望本片能在德國開映。在事業上，一個納粹高級官員曾這樣通知我——他寫信給影業公會的約塞夫白林。</p>
<p>納粹的抗議是這樣的：——</p>
<p>「親愛的白林先生：我在報紙上看到一篇文字，標題為「却利卓別林將扮演希特勒」，內稱卓別林先生將在該片中扮演一懦弱的小猶太人被誤認為一有權的獨裁者，因為他所扮演的另一個角爭即是獨裁者本人。」</p>
<p>「此文且稱卓別林所扮的元首始終未被大偵探如蘇羅門（Solomon）入歇洛克福爾摩斯（Sherlock　Holmes）之流所發現，雖然在此文中希特勒的姓氏當然未曾道及，如此項消息證實不誤，則將引起嚴重的困難以及紛擾，此點請加考慮。」</p>
<p>我希望這部影片能在全能國開映。在事實上，我已準備這影片的拷貝若干部，免費專供任何全能國放映；有人向我保證「大獨裁者」若在全能國放映，必能受觀衆歡迎。</p>
<p>在我而言，這部影片對於我本人前途的影響尙屬次要，為提高情節的價值計，我曾予其他演員如賈克奧凱以及高黛小姐等以極繁重的工作。</p>
<p>雖然在「大獨裁者」一片中大多數角色極易為觀衆認識，指為當代政治界中的名人，但是我本意並不想影射他人，我竭力想抓住這感覺：你，我，以及所有厭惡獨裁者的人都會有着希特勒或墨索里尼一般的面貌。</p>
<p>我以為在新聞片中所見到希特勒的冷酷外表下，實際上還隱藏着緲小的，卑鄙的，低劣的神經衰弱者的性質。墨索里尼的個性與他完全不同——强烈，擾　，自負，內心則為一個村夫。</p>
<p>在攝製「大獨裁者」時確曾發生種種嚴重的問題，一度曾與我的影片極有關係的世界市塲已大為縮小，攝製這部影片所耗　費用却極鉅大，這筆款子大部將取償於美國觀衆。</p>
<p>但是我仍希望中美·南美各國寬弛禁映此片之令，我覺得如果他們所見的獨裁者能與我們所見的相同，他們對於獨裁者的興趣將形减淺。</p>
<p>實際上我是不關懷「大獨裁者」能否賺錢的問題，第一我必須使它成為一張精良的影片，——我必須引觀衆笑，假使在一個世界中，人民全不能笑，那末這世界將不可救藥了。</p>

<p>— 守無</p>
<p>「中旅」昨晚以唐槐秋唐若靑襲家寶吳承達四人出面在光明咖啡館招待新聞界，原因不明，容待聽了「官報」再行續告。這裏頂先可以猜測一下者，當與演出戲目及地點有關。</p>
<p>「中旅」此次重振旗鼓後的戲目，預定為魏如晦編劇，費穆導演之「洪宣嬌」，不過如果時間匆迫，是否能如期演出，還是問題。至於演出地點，現在可能性比較大的，是蘭心，因為璇宮地盤，天風公司已經自己組織了－個「天風劇團」，雖然人馬不足，第一砲「日出」，還是等於全盤向東吳劇社借來，不過無論如何，天風至少總得演出一次戲，在這期間，「中旅」當無法再在璇宮演出也。</p>
<p>「天風」第一砲就演「日出」，頗使關懷者失望，單獨的來看，「日出」自不失為一個好戲，而曹禺的「雷雨」「日出」「原野」三個戲中，以社會意義來講，「日出」也自最强的一個。不過，「日出」出這個戲，在上海已經演得熟而且爛了，如果演出上不能超過以前演出的各次，則其「味道」，也實在淡得很，因為天風的演出，應該與　些秋風戲」有別，不能隨便拉幾個所謂的影明星也者排一下砲，投機取巧地演了些「抄冷版」戲如「日出」者，便算盡了對劇運的責任。除非天風的組織，其基點在於「明星」而不在「戲劇」。</p>
<p>「世界兒女」決定二十六日如期開拍，第一塲戲聞為醫院內景，第一個鏡頭且內定為該片男主角兼劇務主任張翼的戲。因為工作緊張的關係，預定於「古中國之歌」完畢後舉行的「聯誼會」，恐亦將打消，以便集中精力來為「世界兒女」盡力。或者，於「世界兒女」完成後，再補行之。</p>

<h3 id="e1">China Awaits Full US Aid; Able to Contend with Japan Independently; Far East War Affects the Global Situation; Chiang Kai-shek's Statement to American Reporters <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated today that if the United States immediately provides aid to China, the Chinese army can begin a counter-offensive, thereby relieving international tensions in the Pacific and perhaps expediting peace in Europe. The Chairman, in a meeting with an Associated Press reporter, discussed President Roosevelt's promises regarding China. He stated that if China receives sufficient material aid, it will be able to contend with Japan independently. The Chairman made a similar statement during his last meeting with an Associated Press reporter. On January 29th of this year, the Chairman, when meeting with Associated Press Far East Manager Mr. Mullis, said that if the United States were to provide China with half the aid it gives to Britain, the United States would not risk being drawn into the vortex of the Far East war. The Chairman said, "President Roosevelt has guaranteed that China will receive US aid while resisting the aggressor. I would like to express my gratitude for this guarantee. President Roosevelt's emphasis on prompt action will have a significant impact on the situation in the Far East. China has a large and well-trained army that can use American military supplies for a counter-offensive. This counter-offensive will have the effect of relieving international tensions in the Pacific. China's counter-offensive may even shorten the duration of the European war and hasten the restoration of world peace. After the conclusion of this war in Asia and Europe, if the great American democracy can participate in a large part of world construction as promised by President Roosevelt, it will surely produce a better world order." The Chairman reiterated what he had said to Mr. Mullis previously, stating that if China has sufficient material aid, it will be able to contend with Japan without the need for external military assistance. He said that China urgently needs more American financial and military aid to continue its war against Japan. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday signed the Fourth National Defense Budget Appropriation Bill for $1,533,000,000, of which $681,000,000 is for the Navy, including continued construction costs for American bases leased from Britain in the Atlantic and for Pacific defenses (including Samoa and Guam); and $695,000,000 is for the Army, mostly for the construction of barracks. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt approved the construction of naval bases on Guam and Samoa when he signed the appropriation of $153,300,000 last night. It is now set to allocate $13 million for naval construction on the islands. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - British diplomatic circles yesterday believed that the visit of six American warships to Auckland, New Zealand, was a display of Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East. The Navy Department announced that it had recently dispatched two of the newest 10,000-ton cruisers and four destroyers from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii for the visit. It is widely believed that this action is another page in the Pacific "war of nerves," as Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yōsuke has just embarked for Berlin, and this action occurred shortly after President Roosevelt's declaration of his intention to vigorously aid China.</p>

(Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai government has established a new department to manage the land ceded by Vietnam. The department changed two place names, using the names of Lieutenant Colonel Harbley, Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Northern Army, and Sunghram, Prime Minister of the Thai Cabinet, as place names. It is likely that the Thai-Vietnamese peace agreement will be formally approved by the end of March or early April. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - An American newspaper published an opinion stating that if Japan could withdraw from the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, the American government would consider restoring normal relations with Japan. Political figures here are paying close attention to this, and they believe that this American attempt is intended to isolate Japan so that it can be more easily forced to accept American intentions. Regarding this matter, the Nazi Party's official newspaper, the "Völkischer Beobachter," stated that Japan cannot abandon its mission of building a new order in East Asia, and therefore Japan will certainly adhere to the terms of the Tripartite Pact. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>New York - According to Japanese sources here, Tokyo is making remarkable plans politically, the result of which may be an immediate reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. Foreign Minister Matsuoka will resign immediately after returning home from his visit to Berlin, and Japan will immediately withdraw from the Axis. Japanese radical patriots are now strongly urging Prime Minister Konoe to continue advancing southward, believing that Germany will maintain its military operations against Britain. Konoe is not certain about his political soundness and is quite weary of his duties. He is now awaiting Matsuoka's report. Matsuoka is now seeking to obtain a guarantee from Germany that Britain will be defeated, and to conclude a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union as soon as possible. The first point to be decided is the question of Japan's loyalty to the Axis. If Matsuoka finds Germany's attitude "insincere" after his talks with the German and Italian leaders, he will certainly express that Japan "has no choice but to withdraw from the Axis because its allies cannot fulfill the terms of the alliance." After that, if Matsuoka still serves as foreign minister, Japan may strongly request the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. (International dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>Washington - It is reported that the United States has been notified that Germany intends to begin submarine activity in the waters near New York. According to foreign sources, Germany will use long-range submarines capable of navigating dozens of miles to disrupt shipping off the US Atlantic coast. Although this information has been conveyed to the United States, no details are available regarding the nature or location of these activities. It is reported that the main purpose is to cause confusion in shipping in the area. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - Authoritative sources here have learned that a German long-range submarine has been dispatched to US territorial waters. The US State Department and British officials are remaining silent on this matter. According to information obtained here, this Nazi underwater pirate ship has left its European base, but it is not yet known whether it has reached the Atlantic coast. It is rumored that the mission of this German submarine is only to have a propaganda impact and will not take actual action to disrupt convoys. Experts point out that a lone submarine has little military value. We should remember that during the last World War, German submarines traveled to the US coast and sank a number of ships.

However, the German Foreign Ministry will refuse to respond to the American President's stale propaganda rhetoric. Currently, the German Foreign Ministry "must proceed with more important matters" and cannot respond to clichés such as Germany's plan to dominate the world. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Berlin newspapers vehemently attacked President Roosevelt's speech on Saturday night criticizing Germany, denouncing Roosevelt as "poisoning the well," "promoting war," and a "wolf in sheep's clothing." The Beobachter's double-size headline read, "Blood-stained crimes of Jewish Anglo-Saxon Capitalism." (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German newspapers last night harshly criticized President Roosevelt's speech. The newspapers used headlines such as "The Monroe Doctrine Sacrificed on the Altar of World Democracy," "Wall Street Wants to Be the Master of the Future World Order," and "The Lie of Democratic Freedom." They opposed Roosevelt's attempt to force all countries in the world to accept the American concept of "freedom." The "German Political News Service," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, stated that Roosevelt's speech indicated that he would abandon the traditional policies of American diplomacy but lacked the courage to state his goals. He views the United States as the arsenal of democracy and his plan is a world order suitable to his taste, forcing allies and enemies alike to accept it. The newspaper declared that although the United States is a strong country in the Western Hemisphere, it cannot demand world leadership. Any interference by the United States will be rejected by Europe and viewed as hateful and dangerous arrogance. If the United States must interfere, Europe will reject it by the most violent means. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Rome - The famous Italian journalist Gaeta commented on President Roosevelt's speech yesterday, stating that President Roosevelt did not explain the true purpose of his interference in the European war. If Roosevelt wants to be the arbiter of Europe's fate, he must first read more history, study the current situation in Europe, and the reasons why 180 million Europeans are fighting against Britain and uniting in the Tripartite Pact. If the United States wants to say more about the new world order, it should do less. American cooperation with Britain to attack the signatories of the Tripartite Pact will not turn enemies into friends. The relationship between the United States and Europe after peace is established will depend on the attitude the United States adopts during the war. Roosevelt's speech was an attempt to probe for American participation in the war and to legalize his aggressive behavior. Roosevelt seems to have forgotten the will of George Washington, the founding hero of the United States, and has overturned the Monroe Doctrine. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">French Naval Strength; Still Extremely Formidable <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Lausanne - There has been much international attention on the remaining strength of the French Navy since a portion of it was taken care of by Britain. The Lausanne Daily recently published a special dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Vichy stating that the current French fleet is stronger than it was in June of last year, when France and Germany signed the armistice agreement, and is sufficient to support French policy. In terms of battleships, the 35,000-ton "Jean Bart" and "Richelieu" are currently stationed in Casablanca, Morocco, and Dakar, West Africa, respectively, and their strength is steadily increasing. The "Dunkerque," although damaged, will soon be repaired and will have excellent combat capabilities. The "Strasbourg" is still being used as a training ship. As for the "Provence," which was once rumored to have sunk, it is actually intact in Toulon. In short, the French battleship losses are only three ships: the "Bretagne," which sank in Oran, Algeria, the "Dunkerque," which is currently under repair, and the "Lorraine," which was detained in Alexandria, Egypt.

<h3 id="e9">"Italy's Great War Against Enemy Nations" <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Italy's strength is insufficient to contend with Britain and Greece, and it has fallen into dire straits. At this time, if Germany were to launch a lightning attack on the British Isles, Italy's difficulties might be temporarily relieved; if Japan were to seize the opportunity to invade Britain's eastern territories, Italy's difficulties might be considerably lessened; but Germany and Japan each have their own concerns and their own plans, and are unable to see "righteousness" and act accordingly. According to recent trends, German troops are pouring into Bulgaria, and the United States is emphasizing aid to both Britain and Greece. This is the prelude to the next great war; even if the great war battlefield is not entirely within the land, sea, and air controlled by Mussolini's Italy, Italy's land, sea, and air will inevitably be enveloped by the thickest gunpowder atmosphere of the great war.</p>
<p>Strategy does not allow for mechanical application, but rather takes improvisation as a general rule, as is evident in the European war. In the European war, the basic strategy of Germany and Italy was a lightning attack, a quick victory. But now they have had to abandon this strategy. The basic strategy of the British side is to organize and mobilize the manpower and material resources of its various territories, to intensify the naval blockade against Germany and Italy, and to patiently await the maturation of the opportunity to seize final victory, but now there is hope for an early start. Is this a miscalculation in the planning, a mid-course correction? The main key lies in the rapid completion of the defense of the British Isles, rendering the opponent's lightning strike ineffective from the start; and in the bravery of Greece's resistance, which has repeatedly achieved unexpected feats; Italy has not only been defeated by Greece, but has also fully exposed unexpected weaknesses in the African war; thus, the great possibility of first defeating Italy has been discovered. In the late summer and autumn of last year, Germany and Italy, with their ambition to seize the British Isles in one fell swoop, sang loudly about the "Great War of the British Empire"; but now the reality has answered that it is not the Great War of the British Empire, but unexpectedly the "Great War of the Italian Empire" has been formed. The Great War of the Italian Empire was sparked by its own active invasion of Greece. For the past five months, in the course of all land, sea, and air combat on the two continents of Europe and Africa, and on the two seas of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, Italy has repeatedly failed. The first reason for its disastrous defeat is the overestimation of its own strength and the misestimation of the determination and strength of Britain and Greece. When it began its invasion of Greece, it only used 20,000 men, and thought it could complete the conquest of Greece; when it encountered British and Greek resistance and counterattacks, it was not only impossible for Italy to reinforce its advance, but even impossible to hold its ground or retreat in full force; the number of soldiers decreased with each battle, and the only fate was continuous retreat. The second reason is Mussolini's own strategic error. In the African war, in order to satisfy his ambition for an African empire, he made zealous preparations to use Libya as a base to attack Egypt, reach the Suez Canal, and cut off the British Empire's lifeline. He concentrated the supplies, transportation, ordnance, and tools in this area at the port of Bardia, which was close to the front line. When the British garrison greatly reinforced and launched a fierce attack, General Graziani, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Africa, advocated a rapid withdrawal from Bardia to preserve strength and fight elsewhere, but Mussolini ordered him to defend Bardia. Therefore, after nineteen days of bloody fighting, when Bardia fell, the Italian army in eastern Libya was in fact largely disintegrated and destroyed, and of course it could no longer offer effective resistance in the subsequent battles for key locations such as Tobruk and Benghazi. The situation on the Greek side was also very similar. When the British and Greek forces launched a large-scale counterattack, General Badoglio, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces, considered retreating to the port of Vlorë in Albania as soon as possible in order to coordinate with the rear and counterattack with reinforcements from the sea, but Mussolini ordered him to advance. As a result, the attempt to seize military ports such as Salonika was of course not achieved, and the Italian army fought until it was largely destroyed, and the remnant forces had no choice but to collapse. The third reason lies in the fundamental difficulty of reinforcement and supply. The full strength of the Italian navy pales in comparison to the British Mediterranean Fleet. Therefore, the Italian side has made it its basic strategy to avoid naval battles with Britain as much as possible, and it has become increasingly timid due to the occasional naval battles resulting in disastrous defeats. With the Mediterranean Sea controlled by British warships, and Albanian ports subject to intense British air strikes, Italy has fallen into a state of insufficient rear support in both the European and African theaters. The most obvious example is that the Italian mechanized units in Africa lost their effectiveness due to the gasoline shortage.</p>
<p>All of this has increased Britain's courage and has further advanced the goal of defeating Italy. All kinds of British expressions and measures in recent times have pointed to this, even military ports on Italian territory, such as Genoa, have been subjected to attempted bombardments by British warships. The large-scale intrusion of German troops into Bulgaria recently is precisely to relieve Italy's current crisis; and the large-scale landing of British troops in Greece is also in preparation for a major war.</p>
<p>To date, Italy has lost two of its three important ports in the Libyan region of Africa, leaving only the port of Tripoli, which is only 250 miles from the British base of Malta and under direct threat; therefore, if the Italian army does not want to abandon the entire Libya, it must firmly defend the port of Tripoli, otherwise it will be trapped and have no way out. In Italian East Africa, the British army is now coordinating with the Abyssinian indigenous army and advancing directly toward the Abyssinian capital. Here, Italy has the Red Sea on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other, both under British control, and overseas aid is fundamentally impossible. Its fate will depend on the degree to which it can support itself in this region. The sudden transport and coordination of the British fleet with the army to overcome Berbera, the capital of Somaliland, the day before yesterday was another major blow to the Italian army. In Europe, because of the complexities of international relations, the German army cannot go directly from Bulgaria to Torres and Salonika, which is a great loss on the Axis side, but the German army is still able to maintain its advantage, so Italy is not in any major danger in this area. But can half of the strength support the overall situation? The question remains a great one. What's more, the Mediterranean Sea, which surrounds Italy, does not become Italy's impregnable defense, but rather becomes the stepping stone for Britain, which possesses naval supremacy. When the major war begins and Britain and Greece launch their active offensive, the Italian fleet will have no choice but to be forced to fight. Its only remaining hope of victory, apart from its own strength achieving miraculous results, is to rely on the assistance of the German air force and to expect the French fleet to help Italy against Britain.</p>
<p>How exactly this Great War of the Italian Empire will unfold will probably soon be answered by facts.</p>

<h3 id="e17">British Commercial Interests on the Yangtze River: Entirely Deprived by the Japanese; Vessels Detained and Not Returned; Trade Entering and Exiting Lacking Vitality <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Hankou: At the annual meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Tate reported on the state of commerce on the Yangtze River, stating that the central Chinese businesses in Yichang and their interests were subject to all kinds of extremely unpleasant restrictions, amounting to exclusion. The Japanese military authorities continued to interfere with British commercial interests, forcibly detaining their vessels and seizing the cargo on board. Although the British authorities made strong representations, they were ineffective. Although the detained British ships were eventually returned to their owners, the cargo they carried had been taken away. What justification is there for this kind of behavior that violates the rights of neutral countries? It is truly puzzling. Regarding the trade of British people in Hankou, since the early part of last year, no British or foreign individuals have participated in export trade. All trade consisted of selling the remaining tung oil, bristles, tea, and cotton stored locally to merchants under the strict control of the Japanese authorities. There is nothing else to speak of. The sources of rural products have been cut off, and supplies are extremely scarce, resulting in a complete lack of vitality in the Hankou export market. As for the import trade of British merchants, it is also insignificant. Although third-country merchants may see their goods sold in the market, this is only because Japanese merchants transport them in with permits from the Japanese authorities. The reason these goods appear in the market is because their good quality is widely known or because there is nothing to replace them. As for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, there is also no progress at all. British industries are still not allowed to be used by British people. Although there was hope for the opening of the Yangtze River to foreign commerce and navigation as far as Nanjing, this has now become a mirage. As a result, on the 1,400-mile navigable waterway of the Yangtze River from Shanghai to Chongqing, British ships can only operate within the final 170 miles. Apart from the Japanese, British and foreign vessels are idle in Hankou all year round, and the legal use of docks and wharves has not been restored. Although there have been repeated negotiations, the Japanese side always uses military necessity as an excuse to not relax its restrictions in the slightest. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources, Chinese political circles and those close to Chairman Chiang are unanimously pleased with President Roosevelt's speech. They consider his strong statement that the United States will provide material assistance to Britain and other countries opposing the Axis powers until they achieve total victory to be a great guarantee. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's statement that the United States will continue to make a major contribution during the period of world reconstruction is even more encouraging to the Chinese people. China has decided to continue to defend its sovereignty and what other democratic countries are defending. In recent weeks, Japan has repeatedly spread malicious rumors, claiming that cracks have appeared in China's unity and that its ability to resist has been weakened by political disagreements, in an attempt to reduce US confidence in China. These rumors have been completely shattered by the US President's declaration that the hundreds of millions of Chinese people have a great aspiration to defend their country. Chinese political figures are deeply satisfied that the United States has such a clear understanding of Chinese public opinion and the contribution China has made in the united front of democratic countries against the Axis powers' aggression.

He then mentioned the issue of US warships sailing to New Zealand, saying that this was part of the US Navy's exercise and had nothing to do with Japan. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Although Tokyo's Japanese newspapers unanimously condemned President Roosevelt's Saturday speech last night, their attitude was quite calm. The Asahi Shimbun subtly implied that Japan will be forced to adopt Germany's method of dealing with US aid to counter US aid to China. All newspapers unanimously declared that President Roosevelt is leading the United States into war. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that President Roosevelt is helping England, France, and the Netherlands to continue their work of developing the Asian people. The president is also helping General Chiang Kai-shek to fight Japan, attempting to prolong the Sino-Japanese War to weaken Japan. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that President Roosevelt's tone made people feel that the United States was thinking of entering the war. However, the Chumin Shimbun believed that since US aid to Britain and Greece was so huge, it would not be able to provide much to China, which was quite fortunate. (Associated Press, March 18th)</p>

<p>London: Today, the newspapers here are indirectly stating that the British naval fleet has arrived in Greece. Before this news was reported in the newspapers, foreign sources had been widely reporting since the middle of last week that a large number of British troops and supplies had landed in Greece. These foreign sources also relayed rumors from well-informed sources that British troops would soon be fighting alongside the Greeks. Today's newspapers are reporting that a large British escort fleet has passed through an important strait and is heading from Alexandria to Piraeus in Greece. Both the Daily Mail and the Daily Chronicle have headlined this news, stating, "The silent navy has undertaken the most gigantic task, and the escort fleet has passed the Dodecanese." Prominent British military experts have hinted that British and Greek forces may fight together in Greece. Generals Wavell, Bridgeman, and Milner have all published special articles on this issue. Wavell stated that if Hitler's troops can be transferred from Germany to the Greek border, our troops can also use the same relative route. Milner said that if Hitler fights in Greece, it will allow the Allied forces to return to our old position (referring to Thessaloniki). (Associated Press, March 18th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: According to neutral diplomatic circles here today, Germany has increased its forces in Bulgaria to 800,000, apparently because a large number of British troops have landed in Greece. It is reported that Greece is also adopting a stronger attitude towards the German concentration in Bulgaria. It is widely believed that the German concentration was originally intended to intimidate Greece into making peace with Italy, but the determination of Britain and Greece to resist has made it impossible for Hitler to sell his empty threats. The tension in the Balkans has reached a peak, as it is generally believed that a Nazi offensive from Bulgaria is only a matter of days. Neutral sources say that Yugoslavia has firmly refused the German request to pass through the Vardar or Monastir valleys. British officials in Istanbul reiterated assurances today that British troops are prepared for a German offensive. It is estimated that 200,000 British soldiers have already landed in Greece, and another 100,000 are on the way. It is also reported that Hitler recently sent a note to Turkey, which Turkey has responded to. A special envoy has taken the reply to Berlin. Well-informed sources say that Hitler initially intended that the 15 German divisions stationed on the Bulgarian border would threaten Greece into making peace with Italy, so that he could victoriously enter the city of Athens before April 15th. However, Italian Premier Mussolini's failed counteroffensive in Albania has made his plans a pipe dream. (International News Service, March 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The Greek Embassy here has for the first time acknowledged the landing of British troops in Greece. Since the news of British troops entering Greece spread last week, this is the first official acknowledgment of the announcement. Both London and Athens have refused to comment on the news of British troops and their supplies landing in Greece. (Associated Press, March 18th)</p>
<p>London: According to the Daily Telegraph's Istanbul correspondent, the reason why Yugoslavia has been slow to make a deal with Germany is that the Soviet Union sent a note to the Yugoslav government last week. The contents of the note were: (1) Do not join the Tripartite Pact of the Axis powers, as this would amount to war in the Balkans. (2) If Yugoslavia is attacked, the Soviet Union is willing to provide military, technical, and financial assistance, including aircraft. (3) Regardless of what action Yugoslavia takes, it must notify the Soviet Union of its decision 48 hours in advance. It is reported that the Soviet Union has informed Turkey of these three points, and has also informed Greece. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">After British Troops Capture Babile: Italian Troops Surrounded; British Actively Attacking with Land, Sea, and Air Forces; Italian Lines of Communication in Rear Danger of Being Cut Off <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Cairo: A British spokesman here stated last night that, with British troops having captured Babile, another route of threat to Addis Ababa is now developing. British troops are now advancing rapidly on Addis Ababa along 13 routes, which is the heart of Italian East Africa. The spokesman also stated that the capture of Babile will further ease the supply problem. When Italian troops captured Babile last August, the Rome radio station said, "The collapse of the British Empire is now inevitable, the Red Sea has been blocked, and the British Navy cannot pass." When the British army and navy conquered Babile, the British air force not only sent bombers and fighters but also actively cooperated with armored forces. The Middle East Command issued a bulletin describing the British air force's battle achievements, saying, "On the eve of and on the day of the capture of Babile, the British air force continuously bombed enemy airfields. The bombing of the Diredawa airfield was particularly intense. British air force armored vehicles also participated in the capture of Babile. The British air force suffered no casualties." Also, whether the success of the British troops' operations in Keren is the vanguard of a major offensive or part of a six-month battle is still unclear. However, a Reuters reporter learned that "fierce battles are breaking out again in Keren." (Reuters, March 18th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent at the Keren front reported that when British and Imperial troops captured the heights controlling the Keren fortress on Sunday, they captured 800 Italian soldiers. British troops began their attack on Sunday morning after six weeks of preparation, advancing along two routes from the west and southwest. In less than two hours, they had occupied two important heights overlooking the entire city. Indian troops bravely captured a solid fort on a mountain peak four and a half miles southwest of Keren and captured 400 soldiers. When a fort on a mountaintop west of the city was occupied, 200 soldiers were also captured. The Italian army launched fierce counterattacks, but were severely damaged and retreated. British artillery fire and air raids inflicted great casualties on the Italian army. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>
<p>London: With the British army having conquered Babile, the only port of British Somaliland has been freed from Italian control. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, London believes that the joint conquest of the port by the British army and navy has special significance, as it poses a new threat to the Italian bases of Harar and Diredawa. Now, the only sea route for Italian troops in Abyssinia is through Asmara and Massawa, except for the Djibouti route managed by the French. It is impossible for fresh Italian forces to arrive in Abyssinia to reinforce. Recent news from Keren states that British troops are now intensifying the pressure. If they win in Keren, they will open the key to occupying the entire Eritrea. Once the Italian army's last line of defense collapses, British troops in northeast Africa can be transferred to other theaters of war. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>

<p>London: According to a German news agency report, a special envoy sent by Turkish President Ismet Inonu has flown to Berlin on a German plane. It is widely believed that the special envoy is carrying the Turkish President's reply to a letter recently sent to Turkey by Hitler on a special plane. The report also stated that the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, has denied reports of his arrival in Berlin. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>

<p>London: The Athens radio station stated last night that after the Italian army's major offensive on the Albanian border last week was defeated, it now appears to be exhausted. Yesterday, artillery fire was only heard in the central sector. The Italian army launched two small-scale counterattacks, which were quickly repulsed. It launched another attack on Sunday morning, which was repulsed by the Greek army in one fell swoop. Allied air forces, believed to be British air forces, carried out successful attacks on Sunday. After describing the British air force's achievements in attacking Tirana and Vlora on Sunday, the radio station stated that it has been confirmed that 39 Italian aircraft were shot down or destroyed in air combat with Allied aircraft last week, and another 17 enemy aircraft on the ground were severely damaged. At least 15 were bombed and destroyed. The British lost only three aircraft, and both pilots were safe and sound. (Reuters, March 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Full Text of the U.S. President's Speech (Continued to Completion) <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Even now, we must continuously add fuel to keep this great flame burning brightly forever, without any distinction of party, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. The efforts we are currently undertaking will have an impact on each and every one of us. Several weeks ago, I spoke of</p>
<p>four freedoms, namely, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. All of these have now become the last desperate stake. These freedoms may not be immediately attainable throughout the world, but humanity is indeed advancing towards this ideal through democratic steps. If we fail, if democracy is replaced by slavery, then these four freedoms will become contraband. At that time, even mentioning them will be impossible, and it would take centuries to restore them. If we achieve victory now, the meaning of freedom can be enhanced, and the stature and dignity of human life can be increased. There is a great difference between loyalty and obedience. Under a dictatorial system, obedience can be achieved through intimidation, coercion, or deception. Loyalty, however, is different. Loyalty comes from the heart, from understanding the facts and having ancient ideals. It does not require force, but rather supports one's own government. This situation, this situation, is true in present-day Britain, Greece, China, and the United States. And in many other countries, millions of men and women are praying that someday they will have the opportunity to be loyal again. Loyalty cannot be bought. Money alone cannot win this war. On this point, we must not deceive ourselves. Today, there are 1.5 million American citizens toiling in our armies. The spirit and determination of these men in our army and navy do not fall short of our nation's most excellent traditions. The soldiers led by Generals Washington, Jones, Grant, Lee, and Pershing were no different. I also acknowledge that this is an exaggeration, but not a vain one. Our industrial and agricultural output depends on</p>
<p>national sacrifice</p>
<p>and the will to work is great. Our ability to aid other countries determined to resist depends entirely on this will. The people of ravaged countries, if given the opportunity to strike back in the hope of regaining their freedom, also rely on this will for practical assistance. This will of the American people will never be frustrated by threats from foreign enemies and petty, selfish elements within the country. America's determination cannot be hindered by those who profit from war, nor should it be hampered by unnecessary worker strikes, narrow-minded business operations, or intentional slowdowns. We must understand that unless we achieve victory, we cannot run businesses or work, nor can we enjoy freedom. Wise labor leaders and wise business managers will recognize how important it is to engage in shared sacrifice for this great common purpose. The American people should recognize that the current situation is extremely serious, and there is no doubt about it. The reason the American people need a policy is to unite as one and immediately assist Britain, Greece, China, and all European countries whose homelands have been invaded and occupied. From today onwards, our assistance to China, Britain, and Greece will be increased, and will continue to increase until complete victory is won. The great morale of the British people is now stronger than ever. This great morale has enabled the British to endure all the dark days and chaotic, terrifying nights of the past ten months. They have gained the sincere support and assistance of Canada, other dominions, the rest of the British Empire, and non-British peoples around the world who cherish the ideal of freedom. The British people have already</p>
<p>lifted their spirits</p>
<p>to face any invasion that may occur tomorrow, next week, next month, or at any time. In this historically perilous situation, Britain now has a great leader, Churchill. But no one but Churchill can know that Britain's great morale is not only created by Churchill's amazing speeches and courageous deeds. The essence of this spirit of the British people lies within the entire population. The British people's intellect has fully understood a crucial fact: that the British people would rather die as free men than live ignobly as slaves. These ordinary people, whether civilians, soldiers, sailors, or airmen, whether men, women, young, or old, are standing on the front lines of civilization and engaging in war. They are steadfastly defending this front line. This steadfastness will forever be the glory and inspiration of free people on every continent and every island. British allies and their Greek allies need warships. They can obtain warships from the United States. They need airplanes. They can also obtain airplanes from the United States. They need food. They can also obtain food from the United States. They need tanks, cannons, and various military supplies and ammunition. They can also obtain tanks, cannons, ammunition, and various military supplies from the United States. China is now also demonstrating the</p>
<p>great will</p>
<p>of its hundreds of millions of people to resist in order to save its nation from collapse. Under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, China has asked us for help. We, the United States, have answered that China will receive our American assistance. Our country is now doing what our people declared should be done, namely, to be the arsenal of democracy. Our country will now fully fulfill its responsibility. When the dictatorial system collapses (we pray to God that this will happen sooner than any of us dare hope for at present), our country must continue to bear a significant responsibility in the reconstruction of the world. We believe that the ridicule of those dictators, their boasting of being a master race, will all be proven to be Nazi deception and meaningless. For the world has never had, does not have now, and will never have any nation fit to control other nations and be their master. The world certainly does not need any country, relying on the size of its territory and the strength of its military, to rise up and suppress other countries or nations. We believe that any country, no matter how small its territory, has an inherent right to its own existence. We believe that the men and women of such a country, no matter its size, must be able, through peaceful means, to protect human safety, improve healthy living standards, and provide markets for manufactured and agricultural goods, and serve themselves and serve the world. Through such peaceful service, every country will be able to increase its happiness, be able to prevent the horrors of war, and be able to abolish the inhumane treatment of humans by humans. In our country's history, the American people have never encountered such a valuable task. Perhaps our descendants will also rise up and praise us. (United Press Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Cannes, France – Former Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Titulescu passed away here tonight at 11:45 PM, at the age of fifty-eight. Mr. Titulescu was born in 1883 in Craiova, Romania. He excelled in his studies at the University of Craiova and, after graduating, went to Paris to study law. Upon returning to his country, he practiced law and gained a growing reputation. In 1912, he was elected as a member of parliament, which marked the beginning of his political career. Soon after, with the outbreak of the European War, he served as Minister of Finance. In 1919, he represented Romania at the Paris Peace Conference. Afterwards, he switched to the diplomatic field, first serving as Minister to Britain and then as Romania's permanent representative to the League of Nations. He returned to his country in 1927 and again served as Minister of Finance. Shortly after, the cabinet was reorganized, and he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 1933. He was once again appointed as Minister to Britain, but shortly returned to his post as Foreign Minister, which he held through four cabinet reorganizations. He was renowned for his speeches, which he delivered on several occasions at the League of Nations General Assembly and were extremely well-received. In 1930 and 1931, he was elected as President of the League of Nations General Assembly. However, after the coup in Romania last September, which led to the abdication of King Carol II, he came to France and settled in Cannes, where he remained until his death. (Havas Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Declaration of the China Journalism Association <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – The China Journalism Association was established today and issued the following declaration: The organization of the China Journalism Association began in Nanjing. The foundation had just been laid when it fell into Japanese hands. Since the national government moved west, Chongqing has long become the center of the newspaper industry. Journalists from the north and south have mostly come to Sichuan to meet the national crisis. The existing newspaper industry in this city has also made considerable progress in response to the needs of the times. The Department of Journalism at Sichuan University has also been cultivating talents in difficult circumstances and making contributions. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall national propaganda undertaking, Chongqing journalists should take the lead in advocating, gathering fellow professionals from across the country, promoting the established rules of Nanjing, and seeking the advancement of this profession. We have consulted together and agreed to establish this association, initiating preparations for several months now. Fortunately, with the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department and the support of fellow professionals across the country, we were able to hold the inaugural general meeting on March 16th of the 30th year of the Republic of China. We will diligently perform our duties, sharpen our skills, and repay the nation's efforts in resistance and construction with our utmost efforts. Now, at the beginning of this endeavor, we respectfully declare the following based on the consensus of our colleagues and with our sincere intentions: Our country's journalists have a particularly profound and close relationship with the destiny of the nation and the people. Therefore, our colleagues today</p>
<p>first declare that we journalists bear a significant responsibility for resistance and construction. We will always strive to improve ourselves and dare not slacken. If it benefits the nation, we will not hesitate to die. Recalling the late Qing period, from the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras onwards, the Manchu government was corrupt and defeated, and foreign enemies invaded. The trend of disintegration was already forming, and the disaster of national subjugation was imminent. At that time, patriots and people of virtue both at home and abroad inherited the spirit of thousands of years of history and culture, and were recently influenced by the revolutionary thought of the great Confucian scholars of the late Ming dynasty. They summoned the soul of revival and rose up for revolution. Their only weapon was newspapers and speech. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the greatest visionary of modern China, devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years. Initially, he did not have any military resources to rely on, but only relied on his extraordinary wisdom and passion to express his views and appeal to his compatriots. In his early years overseas, he fought in the realm of speech with the royalist party, painstakingly persuading and educating the government, moving them with his words. Once the Tongmenghui was formed, its official newspaper, Min Bao, directly</p>
<p>guided the Xinhai Revolution. From the founding of the Republic of China until Dr. Sun's death, he devoted his sincere and passionate words to teaching the people, never faltering. Therefore, from the perspective of journalists, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was China's greatest writer, and revolution and speech are inextricably linked. Since ancient times in China, public opinion has resided among the people. Therefore, the advice of hermits has been the mother of all political movements. As we look back today to the late Qing and early Republican periods, our country's forums experienced a time of great prosperity. In addition to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, there were also several senior writers who risked violating the restrictive edicts of the time to criticize the Qing government and instill new knowledge. Although their arguments differed in purity, their contributions to enlightening the people should be remembered by future generations. Moreover, the rise of our country's newspaper industry differs from that of other countries. It was largely established by writers to express their political views and was not intended to be a commercial enterprise. This tradition still remains today. In the early years of the Republic of China, the revolution suffered setbacks, and warlords divided the country. The world of speech</p>
<p>fell into misfortune.</p>
<p>However, after the end of the European War, new trends emerged vigorously. The New Culture Movement and revolutionary thought complemented each other and proceeded in parallel. Although there were many different schools of thought that cannot be discussed exhaustively, they largely aimed to promote new knowledge to save China. After being tempered and forged, all rivers flowed into the sea, and the entire nation was unified under one banner. The Three Principles of the People triumphed in the hearts of the people, and the National Revolution advanced throughout the country. Looking back on the past, we can see that the power of speech is greatly and significantly related to the progress of the nation and the people. However, since modern times, the number of our journalists who have sacrificed their lives due to literary inquisitions is truly unknown. As for small and weak newspapers that have been subjected to political or economic oppression, struggling to operate, and collapsing midway, they are even more numerous. Our country's writers have traditionally regarded themselves as national scholars, so the number of ambitious young people who want to devote themselves to the world of speech is the greatest. However, in the past half-century, amidst the accumulation of domestic and foreign troubles, those who have been able to persist in this profession and stand out have been extremely few. For the most part, they have been</p>
<p>plagued by poverty and hunger, dissipating their ambitions and suppressing their talents, growing old and dying in obscurity. Today, our large group of young professionals has already reached perhaps the nth generation. Today, as we gather in the capital, recalling the difficulties of creating the Republic, remembering the sacrifices made in the national crisis, inheriting the legacy of the senior figures in the world of speech in modern times, and reflecting on the heavy responsibilities that we should bear for history and the people, we sincerely believe that the burden on the shoulders of our few journalists is infinitely heavy. Moreover, having witnessed and experienced the ten years of national crisis, and having been born and died in the four years of war, at this critical juncture of rise and fall, success and failure, we can only be sincerely brave and devote ourselves to serving the country, so that China can achieve its freedom and equality, and all the people can enjoy their happiness and benefit. Only then will our work be considered complete. Only in this way can we be worthy of the heroic spirits of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other modern Chinese visionaries in heaven, and the history of the national army and people sacrificing themselves for the country in the four years of resistance. Only in this way can we be worthy of the</p>
<p>failed colleagues</p>
<p>of the past decades who had unfulfilled ambitions, and the young people who aspire to the newspaper industry now and in the future. Only in this way can we be worthy of the loyal colleagues who were murdered in the occupied areas, such as Mr. Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Sixu, Shao Xubai, Cheng Zhenzhang, and Jin Huating, as well as the anonymous heroes who are risking their lives to spread propaganda on the front and rear lines. This is the first point of the national colleagues' ambition and awareness to serve the country with loyalty. With the ambition set, what about the method? Journalism is a subject of modern knowledge that originated in Europe and America and was introduced to China. Although it is called a "study," it is a science to be interpreted as such. Our colleagues believe that Chinese journalists must complete a journalism that is unique to China to meet the needs. Western methods should be used for reference only. There is a common saying in our country that governing does not require much speech. Our newspaper industry is also like this. Only by seeking knowledge in work, and outside of work, there is no knowledge. Today, there are many points that domestic newspapers or regular publications should strive to improve, and only by putting them into practice can</p>
<p>improvement be sought.</p>
<p>Empty talk about journalism is useless. Therefore, our colleagues believe that we must build Chinese journalism in the work of resistance and construction propaganda, gather opinions and ideas, and act immediately. This association is willing to mutually help and encourage fellow colleagues across the country to improve together. We hope that fellow professionals across the country will unanimously participate in this association, each striving to fulfill their duties in their respective positions. At the same time, we must always use this association to exchange new knowledge and report situations in order to clarify our principles and benefit the country with our utmost efforts. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, we would like to first declare the general working principles and express our hopes to the government. Our colleagues would like to first state that newspaper reporters are originally one of the free professions, and this is still true today, but the meaning is different. Since the Japanese army invaded, the country is in danger and the people are humiliated, and every citizen has a responsibility for success or failure, rise or fall. The great meaning of resistance and construction today lies in sacrificing all personal freedom, even life, to fight for the freedom and equality of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>freedom and equality.</p>
<p>We journalists, as the wooden tongues of society and the vanguard of the people, should even more absolutely prioritize the interests of the nation and the people. Even life should not be selfish, let alone anything else. Therefore, strictly speaking, Chinese journalists during wartime are all wartime propaganda workers of the state, no longer the free professionals of peacetime. Our colleagues in this association, regardless of our party affiliation, have a unanimous understanding of this point. Therefore, the future working principles will still generally follow the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department, strictly abide by laws and regulations, and respect discipline, in order to jointly seek the common and highest interests of the nation above all and the people above all. However, we wish to state specifically that the great cause of resistance and construction is of utmost importance and complexity. All departments of the state and society should be the object of research and criticism by journalists. China is vast, and the work of resistance and construction is so broad and complex. What is the efficiency of the implementation of government policies and the promotion of social undertakings? Where can improvements be made?</p>
<p>Where are the advantages and disadvantages?</p>
<p>What are the remedies? Moreover, are the policies themselves appropriate, and are the executing officials lawful? All of this is greatly related to the interests of the people and can affect the security of the nation. Recently, we respectfully read Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the National Political Council, which clearly explained the overall situation and exhorted the people. All his propositions are of the highest principle. Our colleagues in this association respectfully accept the leader's instructions and will advocate for the militarization and national defense of the entire country, abandon outdated ideologies and theories, and work together to organize the national struggle. However, at the same time, we recognize that if we want to complete the great cause of resistance and construction, we must constantly review political achievements, publicize the people's concerns, investigate the advantages and disadvantages, and uphold discipline, ensuring that every policy achieves its intended effect and that every person gets what they deserve. This is the aspiration that our journalists should have for the country and the people and should be the practical focus of future journalistic work. We believe that since the outbreak of the war, based on military necessity,</p>
<p>the publishing industry</p>
<p>has been absolutely subject to the management of the wartime system. All of our colleagues are absolutely happy to comply, and there is no disagreement. However, guidance should be limited to principles, and restrictions on news should not exceed the limits of military secrets. As for general policy guidelines, more research and criticism should be added. Our colleagues are making this statement today because, for many years, local officials in various provinces have largely disregarded the rightful position of the press, not allowing criticism of their administration and not wanting the facts to be published. Except for the publication of official documents, the local newspapers throughout the country have almost completely been unable to perform their duties. Since the outbreak of the war, fellow countrymen across the country have embraced the great principle of military first, obeyed government orders, and worked hard to resist and build. However, some officials have not used the name of wartime control to further block the expression of public opinion. Thinking of this, we feel deeply apprehensive. Our colleagues believe that the greatest mission of the nation in the future is to comprehensively review the actual political situation. Let us take the important aspects of wartime politics, such as the promotion of conscription, the supplementary training of recruits,</p>
<p>economic controls,</p>
<p>and transportation. These are all based on local politics and directly affect the success or failure of the military. The matter is trivial and complex, and the scope is broad. We hope that the government will mobilize journalists throughout the country, provide them with convenience and protection, conduct comprehensive investigations, and discuss them truthfully, so as to arouse the enthusiasm of the people and uncover administrative malpractices. This is precisely the way to strengthen discipline and consolidate the foundation of the country. Our colleagues respectfully remember the leader's teachings and are deeply concerned about the mistakes of the defeated countries in Europe. We know that with the accumulated malpractices of our country's politics and society over the past tens of millions of years, we are afraid of following in the footsteps of this history. If we conceal our illness and avoid treatment, and embellish the administration, good policies will not be effective, the suffering of the people will not be able to express their intentions, and a few unscrupulous officials will instead use the pretext of wartime to cover up everything. Then, even with a great and selfless leader and countless patriotic people, the great cause of resistance and construction will still not be able to eliminate the serious obstacles. The Japanese cannot destroy China, but China's self-deception is strange. Our colleagues are making this statement today because we see that the military has already passed the most dangerous stage, and the diplomatic situation is indeed</p>
<p>advantageous.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the only way is to mobilize public opinion, conduct open reviews, and not conceal or hide anything, and to strictly adhere to the correct awareness of the resistance and construction program, without involving military secrets, without harming its prestige, without affecting the morale of the front lines, and without revealing administrative secrets. The implementation of all policies and the merits and demerits of the executing officials should all be subject to the fair review of the newspapers, and local civil and military officials should not obstruct them. We will use this responsibility to diligently seek knowledge and announce correct public opinion, so that our people across the country can become stronger and stronger in the war and eventually achieve the victory of resistance and construction and the completion of national defense. Our colleagues believe that in this new stage of turning danger into safety, if we can truly reform and make progress, our colleagues in this association, with their writing and labor as their profession and wartime propaganda as their responsibility, with their heavy workload, respectfully express their condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country and their respect for the loyal colleagues in the occupied areas. At the same time, we strongly condemn the extremely small number of people who willingly create false propaganda for the Japanese. Their crimes are serious and despised by the entire nation, but they cannot harm our country and people in the slightest. Finally, we pay our respects to Chairman Chiang and all the officers and soldiers, and deeply thank the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department, and request the assistance of the government and people from all walks of life for this association, so that it can fulfill its responsibilities.

<h3 id="e31">Telegrams of Respect to Lin, Chiang, et al. <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – The China Journalism Association was established in Chongqing on the 16th, and telegrams were sent to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to express respect, to the front-line soldiers to express condolences, and to the families of the deceased journalists to express condolences. The original texts are recorded as follows: Telegram of respect to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang of the National Government: To His Excellency Lin, Chairman of the National Government, and His Excellency Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: After four years of resistance, national revival is in sight. We respectfully admire your leadership in the central government, achieving victory on the battlefield, promoting the grand plan of restoring order and reforming things, and implementing the great policy of self-strengthening and innovation, thereby enabling hundreds of millions to cooperate and soldiers to fight with common hatred, to promote righteousness in heaven and earth. Seeing that our rivers and mountains are being reorganized, this association has gathered in the capital, diligently performing its duties, looking up to your meritorious deeds, and greatly admiring your worries and labors. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect, conveying the voices of the people. We respectfully request your consideration. Yours respectfully, The China Journalism Association.

<h3 id="e32">Zhongshan Society Sends Telegram to the Communist Party Representatives <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - The annual meeting of the Zhongshan Society passed a telegram addressed to Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, and other seven participating council members. The original text is as follows: Esteemed Mr. Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yuzhang, Chen Shaoyu, and Qin Bangxian, the government's sanctioning of the New Fourth Army for violating orders and disrupting discipline was truly an unavoidable measure during wartime. The leader's painstaking efforts are evident to all. Your Excellencies, upon accepting the orders of your party, have refused to attend this session of the National Political Council and are making demands and threats. Persuasion from various quarters has been ineffective, causing compatriots at home and abroad to fear a resurgence of internal strife. The members of our society, meeting at this time for our annual gathering, wish to speak to Your Excellencies based on the principle of loving people with virtue. Looking back, when the Father of the Nation aimed for revolutionary progress, he permitted members of your party to join our party in a personal capacity and dedicate themselves to the National Revolution. This was the initial foundation for the confluence of revolutionary forces nationwide, leading to the subsequent surge of the revolutionary tide. However, before the Northern Expedition was completed, your party sought to usurp political power, leading to the division in the fifteenth year of the Republic. It was not until the Xi'an Incident that your party fundamentally changed course, recognizing that class revolution could not succeed in China today and that nationalism would ultimately prevail like the sun and moon in the sky. Then, we reunited with our party, leading to today's sacred war of resistance. After the outbreak of war, your party solemnly declared its recognition of the Three Principles of the People as what China needs today and its willingness to strive for the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People. Which patriotic person was not inspired? However, time cannot be turned back, and the lives of the people cannot be disregarded. In the past twenty years, due to the errors in the path taken by your party, how many young people have died in vain, and how much of the nation's vitality has been depleted? The painful experience is unbearable to recall. Yet, in recent years, your party's so-called methods of struggle have remained unchanged. Even in the face of the nation's and the people's survival hanging by a thread, you have been unable to suppress your ambition to seize leadership. Instances of outwardly complying while inwardly opposing have emerged endlessly. As Lincoln said, "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." Our colleagues deeply believe that sincerity is the foundation of scholarship and politics. The truth of science comes from sincerity, and the morality of politics lies in honesty. Our Chinese nation has always been based on loyalty, kindness, and peace in its conduct. Regarding the theory of revolution, class struggle is ultimately incompatible with China's economic reality. Regarding the methods of political struggle, schemes and conspiracies can never prevail in the long run. How long is our life? Why bother to exhaust ourselves with pretense, waste our strength on internal strife, and cause worry to our patriotic compatriots, inviting ridicule from our eastern neighbors? We firmly believe that warfare and nation-building must be carried out under one ideology, one government, and one leader to achieve success. Your Excellencies have also publicly stated that one ideology is the Three Principles of the People, one government is the National Government, and one leader is Chairman Chiang. However, considering the facts of recent years, where is the support, and where is the obedience? Even the most brilliant propaganda cannot escape the eyes and ears of the world. The failure of one party is a small matter. However, it is unforgivable by the Father of the Nation and the martyrs, and unpardonable by the world and future generations, if the lifeblood of the nation, the youth of the era, are sacrificed without value due to the errors of the leadership's path. Human affairs are all about solving the future, and the completion of personality comes from continuous efforts day after day. This is the objective truth and subjective morality. Indulging in arrogance and selfishness is inappropriate for politicians and certainly not what revolutionaries should do. Your Excellencies are prominent figures in your party and surely cannot bear to see your party repeat past mistakes, adding setbacks to the Chinese revolution. We hope that you will convey the intentions of the members of our society earnestly to the comrades of your party's leadership, first fundamentally changing the unworkable path, confirming that the Three Principles of the People are China's only ideology and that the Chinese Nationalist Party is the sole leader of the revolution. Then, send representatives to sincerely negotiate with our party on how to work together sincerely on both the war of resistance and nation-building. Since your party and our party have shared hardships in revolutionary history and there is no lack of genuine friendship on a personal level, and since four hundred and fifty million compatriots and countless friendly nations are eagerly hoping to see our two parties join hands for national salvation from beginning to end, we should strive to achieve this goal, as it is an objective need of the nation and the world. Accepting advice is the mark of a good person, and failing to act when seeing righteousness is cowardice. We believe that Your Excellencies will not regard the intentions of the members of our society as mere words. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington - The U.S. government is now preparing to implement aid-to-Britain procedures, increasing military supply orders by more than 60 percent. Consequently, key defense industries are expected to experience a shortage of skilled workers. Yesterday, Knudsen and Hillman, heads of U.S. production management, along with Labor Secretary Perkins, convened representatives from both labor and management in the metal industry. Knudsen stated that the U.S. must now increase production on an unprecedented scale. Our need for machinery for ships, tanks, and aircraft is extremely pressing. Therefore, both labor and management in the metal industry have a responsibility to train more skilled workers in a very short period to meet domestic and foreign needs. He also suggested that the shipbuilding industry should have three apprentices for every skilled worker. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives will begin discussing the $7 billion lend-lease bill today. This massive bill is expected to pass on Wednesday.

<h3 id="e34">Maritime Aid Considered Crucial <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Washington - According to current speculation, the U.S.'s active steps to aid Britain will include, firstly, the early transfer to Britain of another batch of over-age destroyers; and secondly, the provision of maritime armed assistance. Congressional circles have spoken definitively about the transfer of old destroyers to Britain, while diplomatic commentators such as Scripp and Hagar Ward's Seymour have also announced that after the President's speech on Saturday, the U.S.'s armed assistance to Britain will certainly be maritime assistance, as it is generally believed. According to Washington sources, Britain is busy dealing with the situation and unable to effectively eliminate the new threat from German submarines. Therefore, the U.S. has no choice but to provide new forms of assistance. This is evident from the President's statement that "the U.S. does not want to stop its assistance until the dictators are completely defeated." All qualified observers feel that the transfer of old destroyers and small warships is only a temporary plan, and what follows will be intervention by the U.S. Navy and the transfer of U.S. merchant ships.

The items include all items deemed critical by both the Army and Navy, as well as 20 items deemed important by the government. Sources say that the government is planning a revised shipping route plan, which will be announced soon. (18th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt signed an order yesterday restricting the export of defense essentials such as machinery, raw materials, blueprints, designs, and detailed specifications.

<h3 id="e38">Zhejiang Education Department Vigorously Promotes People's Education in Central Schools; Stipulates Three Points for Counties to Comply With <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondent) The Zhejiang Education Department stipulates that compulsory education and remedial education for illiterate people should be implemented simultaneously in township central schools and Bao National Schools in accordance with the National Education Implementation Outline. All county township central schools and Bao National Schools should establish a People's Education Department to run adult classes and women's classes. Since the first semester of the 29th year, national education has been implemented. The budgets of various counties have been successively approved. The semester has also ended. However, after reviewing the implementation situation in various counties over the past semester, many schools have neglected the facilities of the People's Education Department. From this semester onwards, the following three points are stipulated: (1) Every national school must compulsorily open adult classes or women's classes, one class each in the first and second halves of the year; (2) Township Bao chiefs can use the method of Bao levy to strictly enforce compulsory school attendance; (3) When the funds for oil lamps, etc., needed by each school are insufficient, adult classes can be changed to morning classes or afternoon classes. The county governments have been ordered to urge and ensure implementation. Supervisors who fail to handle the matter properly and are found to be true will be punished.</p>

<p>(Chongqing, 18th) The Ministry of Education's Electrified Education Committee has recently completed the production of three kinds of historical loyal and martyred story slides (Wen Tianxiang) (Shi Kefa) and (Zheng Chenggong).

<p>Qian Qiling, Huang Jingwan, Dong Bin, Zhao Xingpu, and others from the Education and Relief Department of the Shanghai United Amusement Association, in view of the recent sharp rise in prices and the increasing hardship of people's livelihoods, have found homeless children on the thoroughfares, following and begging. Even when pedestrians buy food, they are often stolen or even snatched away, almost everywhere. In the future, the more they gather, the more they will affect the foundation and future of the country. Relief should be sought quickly to eliminate hidden dangers. Therefore, the Education Committee was convened to discuss the solution, planning to use the name of the United Association to establish an orphanage to shelter genuinely homeless children in the concession, strictly educate them, and teach them skills so that they can support themselves after their training. If there are wealthy people in the concession who are willing to donate their houses to help establish a homeless children's education program and do not charge rent, borrowing five or six rooms would be sufficient. The goal is to complete this before Children's Day.</p>

<p>The budget for the Shanghai Municipal Council Library's various expenditures for this year is 97,640 yuan, an increase of 4,760 yuan over last year. The reason for the increase is due to the increase in staff salaries, the increase in the price of various items, and the increase in the purchase of new books. The analysis is as follows: 1. Salaries increased by 32,270 yuan; 2. Savings increased by 40 yuan; 3. Travel expenses increased by 1,500 yuan; 4. Medicines, electricity, telephone, and all miscellaneous expenses increased by 2,690 yuan; 5. Insurance premiums increased by 50 yuan; 6. New book addition fees increased by 20,000 yuan; 7. Binding fees increased by 1,000 yuan. Under the new book purchase fee item, as usual, 20% is proposed, namely 8,000 yuan, for the purchase of Chinese books. Several Chinese members of the Library Committee expressed their approval for adding another layer to the new book purchase fee. As a result, it was decided to sign an attachment stating that if the Bureau's economic situation permits, this expenditure should be increased to 50,000 yuan. The above budget has been reviewed by the Library Committee, and if necessary, the Director of Finance and the Director of the Library may jointly adjust it. It is approved for submission to the Finance Committee for review.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Food - Hoarding Tigers' Greed Knows No Bounds - Subsidies Exceed 4,000 Yuan - The Quality of Rice Sold in the Market is Indistinguishable - Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai in Succession <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The manipulation of foreign rice in the market has worsened, and the black market subsidies are escalating. Major dealers are holding firm, while smaller dealers are taking the opportunity to raise prices. There has been no movement towards an appropriate solution for the rice market, causing widespread anxiety. Speculators are taking advantage of the chaos to maximize illegal profits. Although there is sufficient supply in the market, access to food for ordinary people is becoming increasingly difficult. Small rice shops lack rice to sell, while hoarders remain determined, hoping for conflict. As a result, the subsidy on small package rice, which had never exceeded 4,000 yuan, was broken yesterday. The subsidy per hundred bags jumped from 3,700 yuan to 4,200 yuan, then to 4,300 or 4,400 yuan, the highest level seen in recent black market trading. This translates to a price of 108 or 109 yuan to 111 yuan per metric stone. No. 1 Saigon rice had a subsidy of 3,700 yuan per hundred bags, with rumors of a maximum price of 40 yuan in the dark market for 3,500 bags. No. 2 Saigon rice was at 3,700 to 3,900 yuan. Large package rice was at 3,800 yuan, and even low-quality broken rice required a subsidy of 3,300 yuan. Yesterday, competition between the Shantou gang and retailers in urgent need further tightened the situation. In the afternoon, the market eased slightly, and the total volume of transactions increased to nearly 20,000 bags. Prices are high, but the quality of the rice is increasingly mixed, with low-quality rice sold at high prices. This is truly an unprecedented crisis for the people's food supply in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The rice hoarders are so rampant that even though large quantities of foreign rice arrive in Shanghai daily, the poor are left helpless due to the lack of effective measures. Yesterday, a large shipment of foreign rice arrived. The Taigu Company's Taoyuan ship, carrying 4,685 bags from Hong Kong, arrived yesterday morning and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship, also from Hong Kong, brought 14,730 bags, along with 1,950 bags of corn, arriving at around 4 p.m. yesterday (customs time) and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf. Unloading continued overnight. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 1,528 bags of foreign rice, which will be transferred to Qingdao today. Furthermore, the French Company's Khai Dinh ship, directly from Saigon, brought 20,000 bags of foreign rice, which arrived at dawn yesterday and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to unload. It is rumored that the French Company's Los Angeles ship will also arrive in Shanghai last night, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon, the exact amount is pending verification, and is scheduled to dock at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou to unload. It is now rumored that rice hoarders, to avoid potential denunciations, have moved their rice stocks to Pudong and Hongkou, as seen in the unloading of rice from French ships in Hongkou. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although the sales of thick and thin Japonica rice are still sluggish, the black market for foreign rice continues to fluctuate, raising overall market expectations. Owners are unwilling to sell lightly, and strenuous efforts to raise prices have resulted in a reversal from fatigue to tightening for both thick and thin Japonica rice, with prices rising by one or two yuan. Special Japonica rice from Changzhou is quoted at 128 yuan per dan, down to 126 yuan. Kunshan Japonica rice is high from 124 or 125 yuan, to mixed goods at 120 yuan. Original packages from Zhongguan are 106 yuan, and thin Qingjiao rice is quoted at 117 or 118 yuan per dan, with original packages at 125 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to soaring prices, the sales volume of glutinous rice has declined. Most major dealers, seeing profits diminishing, have withdrawn, leaving only some small demand from cake shops and food vendors. Therefore, although owners are trying to raise prices, they are unlikely to succeed. Market prices are mostly unchanged, just average. Hong Kong white glutinous rice is still quoted at 107 or 108 yuan, down to 104 or 105 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Arrive in Shanghai - Prices Rise Instead - Also Affected by Rising Foreign Rice Prices <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, at the opening in the morning, continued the recent downward trend. With the arrival of transshipped flour from Hong Kong, including over 36,000 bags of Jianfu Foreign Company's Bell Tower brand, unloading was underway, so sentiment was calm. Huawu's Australian flower flour allocated to customers was 32 yuan, 34 cents, and Jinlong brand Canadian flour was 31 yuan, 30 cents. However, in the afternoon, the situation turned tight again because foreign rice prices rose again, and speculative hoarders secretly bought up supplies. The market was secretly tight by 20 or 30 cents. It is said that over 100,000 bags of Canadian flour are due to arrive in three or four days, and Chinese factories are continuing to supply flour at flat prices. In reality, the outlook may not be too optimistic, but the current rice price is being raised unilaterally, and the future of the flour market is likely to be affected accordingly.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Arriving in Shanghai continuously. The Taigu Company's Taoyuan ship, in addition to bringing over 4,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, also brought a large shipment of flour, totaling 36,771 bags. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng ship also brought 3,000 bags of flour from Hong Kong, and the Yusheng ship brought 5,050 bags. All three ships arrived in Shanghai successively yesterday, totaling 44,821 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market was as quiet as usual yesterday. The supply of domestic durum wheat has long been depleted, and there is a lack of goods in the market. Factories are not in a hurry to buy, as Fufeng Factory has already stopped production, and Fuxin Factory has a temporary supply of newly arrived foreign wheat. Only Japanese factories occasionally buy, but selling prices are extremely high, requiring around 46 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's soybean market experienced a sharp decline, with statistics showing a drop of about two yuan. 250 bags of Qingdao beans were rushed into the market at a price of 47 yuan, 87 bags of Tianjin beans at 49.5 yuan, 170 bags of Jiaozhou beans at 48 yuan, and over 2,000 bags of Guide beans (half of which were absorbed by hoarders) dropped from 46 yuan to 44 yuan. 200 bags of Wuhu beans were priced at 45.78 yuan, and 50 bags of Tianjin green beans at 45 yuan. In short, the various goods not under the cloud of international war have long been the focus of manipulators for clarification. The source of soybeans comes from the Northeast, and the sales route is promoted to Nanyang first. Currently, the sales market is watching and waiting, causing speculators to lose their backing, and the market is showing a collapse. It is feared that other speculators will be affected, and it may not be far off.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Finance - The Exchange Market, Tight for Four Consecutive Days, Began to Relax Yesterday <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The HSBC exchange rate was unchanged yesterday. In the black market for British and American exchanges, because foreign companies have stopped buying, speculators were selling throughout the day, and the supply of funds felt abundant, so the exchange market, which had been tight for four consecutive days, showed a relaxation. However, it was still tight early in the morning because speculators were still closing out long positions. The price of U.S. exchange for next month reached 5.375 yuan. After 10 a.m., Chinese speculators began to sell, and the price of U.S. exchange for March was made to 5.4375 yuan. However, it was reported that British and American banks were absorbing strongly, so the afternoon close recovered. In the subsequent market, speculators continued to sell and ease, coupled with negative rumors, such as the increasingly deteriorating relations between the United States and Germany. However, British banks and Chinese banks were still buying, and the futures and spot prices had slightly widened. The closing price for spot British exchange was 3 pence 3125, and U.S. exchange was 5.4375 yuan, which was lower than the previous day by 0.015625 and 0.0625, respectively.</p>

It is estimated that speculators made a profit of 5.375 yuan on the U.S. exchange for April. HSBC's listed price showed no change in the evening. The silver equalization tax is still levied at 24.5%. Subsequently, Chinese speculators suddenly came to sell, and the market turned hard. British and American banks absorbed the U.S. exchange price for this month at 5.4375 yuan.

The spot price for British exchange was 3 pence 296875, and U.S. exchange was 5.40625 yuan, which was higher than the morning opening by 0.03125 and 0.03125 respectively.</p>
<p>Futures and Spots are Pulled Apart Later</p>
<p>Speculators continued to sell in the afternoon, and because British banks had profits and Chinese banks were still in strong need, the easing trend was very slight. The U.S. exchange for April generally traded at 5.4375 yuan, and it was unchanged until the evening close. The U.S. exchange futures were slightly tighter than spot.

<p>Yesterday's gold market on the dark market, started to rise and then suddenly reacted and fell, with prices already retreated into the 6,400 yuan level. Firm confidence suddenly became weak. The reason was that it was reported that settlement for importers was no longer available, foreign exchange turned loose, and there were also widespread rumors that friction had occurred again in U.S.-German relations. Therefore, the morning opening was led by a certain gold firm, raising the price to 6,460 yuan, but it soon came out again. Moreover, exchange firms (Xinfeng Yong, Dafeng), securities firms (Xiangxing Yong, Defu), silver firms (Hengji), and gold firms (Rencheng Yong, Hesheng) successively showed a selling trend. The Shanghai West gang even had news of selling, and the price fell by 100 yuan. In the afternoon, a low price of 6,360 yuan was seen.

<p>Still down by a small 49 yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, because the buying trend outside the market on the 10th was very strong, the price had already reached 6,450 yuan, so with people's hopes for good, the opening price was raised again, resulting in 6,460 yuan, which was 29 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. However, the transaction volume was very small. It fell immediately after opening, and then retreated to 6,440 yuan. At that time, there were still many transactions. It suddenly rose again by 10 yuan to 6,450 yuan. However, because foreign exchange was no longer settling for foreign firms, the domestic market turned hard and affected the selling side. Firms such as Chengji, Dafeng, Yida, Gongda, and Xinfeng Yong came to sell successively, gradually decreasing to within 6,400 yuan, reaching 6,390 yuan. At this moment, Decheng pulled in, pulling out 400 yuan from the tired situation to 6,410 yuan. Unexpectedly, Hengji, Rencheng Yong, and other floating longs suddenly closed out, pouring out a very large amount, heavily pressing down to 6,375 yuan. At noon, it stabilized slightly, with Zeng Linggao to 6,400 yuan. The closing result was 6,395 yuan. After closing, it was approximately 6,388 yuan. The afternoon opening was lackluster, only 6,380 yuan. Hesheng and Rencheng Yong sold again, and it soon fell to 6,360 yuan, lacking support. Later, relying on firms such as Hengji and Yida to grab at low prices, it finally rose back, but the upward trend was slow. The highest price before closing was 6,391 yuan, and the evening close was 6,382 yuan, 49 yuan lower than the previous day. Calculated according to the settlement price of U.S. dollars for April at 5.40625 yuan, it was 6,441 yuan and 59 yuan. The fluctuation for the entire day was 100 yuan. The selling price of the cash company's own brand gold was about 300 yuan higher than the futures (futures), and the buying was 80 yuan lower than the selling.

<p>The yarn market started high and then softened, and the trend was more frustrated. This was due to the return of foreign exchange and the decline in gold, which led to a decline in confidence. At the same time, shorts resumed their activities, and the market tended to decline. However, actual needs were better, and the Hong Kong gang bought about a thousand bags, so the major dealers in the same industry are still in a long position, but those outside the industry are continuing to swap empty positions, so the pressure is still strong. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,420 yuan, and the low price was 1,399 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,401 yuan, fell to 1,396 yuan, and the closing price returned to 1,405 yuan. Today, 1,230 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is ordinary, and the situation is soft. This is because of the plunge in U.S. cotton, which makes people feel bland. Shenxin No. 2 and 9 factories have a slight need.</p>

<h3 id="e72">British Nationals Negotiate with Japanese Side: Re-election of Municipal Council Directors; Avoiding All Disputes is Deemed the Best Policy; Rumors of Increased Japanese Directors Not Confirmed <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated that the next year's new board of directors election would be held on April 2nd and 3rd, and limited foreign national groups to submit the list of candidates to the authorities before the 25th of this month. Now that there are few days left, the future development of the situation can be highly valued. Yesterday, rumors suddenly spread that the British and Japanese sides had reached a compromise, and negotiations are underway to establish a "gentleman's agreement" to reduce the number of British directors and increase the number of Japanese directors. However, this election is based on the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang area, which is the fundamental law of the International Settlement and should not allow either side to unilaterally change it.</p>
<p>Incumbent Directors to Remain for Another Year</p>
<p>According to a senior official of the British Residents Association, who spoke to a Western newspaper reporter yesterday, the British side here is currently negotiating with the Japanese side and does not intend to hold a vote for the new board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council this year, but intends to ask the current directors to continue to serve for another year. The details of the negotiations, however, cannot be disclosed at present. When inquired of the British official circles about the move to conduct negotiations with the Japanese side to establish a "gentleman's agreement," they also expressed that they were not aware of it. According to another official, this news may have been released by the Japanese side and is still exploratory in nature. However, the Japanese side has not yet expressed its agreement to maintain the status quo, but as far as we know, the Japanese side may make a request to propose more candidates. But generally speaking, this matter has not yet reached a definitive decision.</p>
<p>Rumors of Reduced Number of British Directors</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that it had learned that a "gentleman's agreement" is currently being drafted between the British and Japanese residents of the city to reduce the number of British directors in the Municipal Council and increase the number of Japanese directors, so it is expected that the number of Japanese director candidates will increase during this year's Shanghai Municipal Council director election. It is reported that the Election Committee of the British Residents Association has recently held several meetings to discuss reducing the number of British director candidates. Although the five current British directors of the Municipal Council have all expressed their willingness to participate in the election again this year, it is generally believed that the Japanese residents have been encouraged to increase the number of Japanese directors in the Municipal Council, and the candidates that the British residents will recommend this year will not exceed four, or only three. It is widely believed that if the British residents only recommend three candidates, then the ratio of directors in the Municipal Council, which was five British, two American, and two Japanese last year, will change this year to three British, three Japanese, one American, and one director candidate from other foreign residents. Local Japanese newspapers have been silent for a long time on the issue of the annual election of directors of the Municipal Council. Yesterday (the 17th) they began to express that the number of Japanese directors in the Shanghai Municipal Council will increase this year, and said that the increase in the number of Japanese directors is "currently underway peacefully, and as a result, the problems encountered by the International Settlement may improve." As of now, only the American residents have definitely recommended Mr. Allman and Mr. Myers as candidates.</p>
<p>MacDonald's Letter Offers Unique Insights</p>
<p>MacDonald, an independent candidate who failed in last year's Shanghai Municipal Council director election, wrote to the English-language "China Press" yesterday morning, expressing that the Western director election system in the International Settlement should be improved because the current system is extremely unfair. The letter stated that British residents in the International Settlement who have the right to vote can cast more than 100 votes per person, and there are also those who have no right to vote, because the property they own is the standard for voting. Currently, there are eight large British companies in Shanghai, and the total number of votes obtained by these eight companies reaches 5,127. There are also 19 British residents who can obtain a total of 3,670 votes. There are 17 British residents with more than 50 votes, totaling 1,324 votes. If property is the standard for voting, then the entire International Settlement is actually ruled by a small number of British people. The letter also stated that the number of votes owned by these eight major British companies is enough to抵(equal) the total number of votes cast in the 1939 International Settlement election of Western directors, and is also enough to抵(equal) the maximum number of votes obtained by Japanese candidates in 1940. Among these eight major companies, Jardine Matheson, Mackinnon Mackenzie, and Wheelock Marden have a total of more than 3,960 votes. It is found that this number of votes can control the British general election votes and rule the International Settlement. Mr. Keswick, representing Jardine Matheson, and Mr. Marden, representing Wheelock Marden, have more than 3,000 votes because of their high social status in Shanghai, and their impact is quite amazing. From 1900 to 1938, the list of attendees and the total number of votes cast at each Western Residents' General Meeting of the International Settlement were printed on the spot for distribution to taxpayers for reference. However, since 1939, this printed material has been cancelled. We are deeply puzzled by the cancellation of this printed material. MacDonald finally discussed that under a democratic political system, such an unfair election with property as the standard should be improved. Moreover, the United Kingdom is currently fighting for a democratic political system, and the election system of the Shanghai International Settlement should be amended.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Three Years of Confinement in Hankou: Three Foreign Vessels Released; Simultaneously Left Hankou for Shanghai, Having Already Entered Port Yesterday; Rumored to Have Been Leased by Japanese Shipping Company <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Wuhan to the west, foreign vessels anchored outside Hankou have been monitored and detained at their original anchorage, unable to move. Later, in June of the eighteenth year, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson dispatched the Wuhu and Ruihe vessels to Wuhu to transport British troops for redeployment. The Ruihe originally transported the British troops withdrawing from Hankou back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire's Wuhu</p>
<p>After the vessel arrived in Hankou, it was immediately transferred to the Wulin vessel, which had been trapped in Hankou for a long time, to transport the British troops withdrawing from Hankou back to Shanghai. The Wuhu vessel replaced the Wulin vessel in Hankou to comply with the Japanese military's order prohibiting foreign vessels from moving. Therefore, it is still trapped in Hankou. It is now learned that the Dutch vessels S.S. Wilhelmina and S.S. Beatrice, and the Portuguese vessel S.S. Sado, represented by</p>
<p>Fuh Shun Company</p>
<p>at 150 Jiujiang Road, have been specially permitted by the Japanese military to be released, and the three vessels left Hankou for Shanghai simultaneously on the 14th of this month. The three vessels had been anchored in Hankou for three years, and the hull was in disrepair, inevitably slightly damaged, so the sailing was slower. The estimated journey could be reached today, but the three vessels had already</p>
<p>Entered Port</p>
<p>one after another between 1:10 PM and 2:10 PM (Customs time) yesterday afternoon. The two Dutch vessels were to dock at the Butterfield &amp; Swire wharf in Pudong, and the Portuguese vessel Sado went to the No. 7 and No. 8 buoys in South Huangpu for anchorage. The three vessels are all cargo ships, with a size of five to six thousand tons. They must be docked for repairs. When asked about the future navigation route, the agent Fuh Shun Company did not give a definite answer. According to external news, the three vessels have been leased by the Japanese Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. The ability to leave Hankou is also due to the power of Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. These three vessels are the first batch of foreign vessels that have been detained in Hankou for three years.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Japanese Side Monitors Foreign Vessels' Movements: Four Vessels Detained in Zhoushan; Companies Have Not Received Release Report <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The four vessels detained by the Japanese side in the Zhoushan waters, the German vessel Moufu, the Italian vessel Changde, and the Shang vessel Xin'anli and Anmanli, have been detained for more than ten days. The respective vessel companies have successively requested the consular authorities to make representations to the Japanese. It was learned yesterday that the Japanese side had informally stated that the vessels would be released soon, resulting in news that they had been released. However, according to inquiries made by a New Voice News Agency reporter last night to the shipping department of the Moufu vessel, the respective companies have not yet received a telegram confirming the release, so the rumors are difficult to verify. Everyone believes that at this time when the Japanese side is expanding the scope of the blockade, they will further monitor the movements of foreign vessels. The detained vessels may have to be anchored for a considerable period of time. The respective companies are now waiting for news. If the vessels are not released indefinitely, they are prepared to submit further representations. After the closure of the Haikou and Dongshi ports, no sailing vessels have continued to export since yesterday. The Ruitai and Mali vessels, which cleared customs last week, have not reported their whereabouts since exporting.</p>

Mr. Zhou Rujun raised Shen Kang Shen Zhuang 25 yuan. Xu Lian donated four boxes of cod liver oil. We hereby express our gratitude on behalf of the orphans of the hall.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Soaring Rice Prices are the Main Cause: Labor Unrest is Becoming More Serious Again; French Tramway Mechanics Go on Strike; Meifeng Cotton Mill is Vandalized by Workers <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The French Tramway Company previously experienced a strike that lasted for many days. It was not until the authorities intervened that work resumed. However, disputes arose again later, but there was no further major strike. Although there were some details that were not agreed upon by the labor and management, they were not enough to hinder the harmony between labor and management. Not long ago, the labor side caused labor disputes due to the "union" fee issue, which was also resolved soon. Recently, the labor side brought up the old matter again, causing the mechanics department workers to request the management to fulfill some of the details that had been discussed before, and because they did not receive a response, the workers in this department suddenly went on strike at about 1:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Mechanics' Strike Temporarily Suppressed</p>
<p>After learning about the strike, the French police, fearing that it would cause trouble, dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for alert. At the same time, the political department also sent personnel to investigate. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the management agreed to respond on the 25th. However, the labor side was still dissatisfied. Later, the political department persuaded them to resume work quickly to avoid hindering the work, and that all the conditions that had not been agreed upon before would be resolved in the shortest possible time. The labor side then agreed and immediately resumed work.</p>
<p>Photo Engraving Industry Raises Conditions</p>
<p>In recent years, rice prices have soared, and everything is expensive. According to the worker's cost of living index published by the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 28th of last month, it has exceeded several times before the war. The lives of ordinary salary earners and low-level wage workers have deteriorated even more. There are more than 20 photo engraving industries in Shanghai, with a total of seven or eight hundred employees (including those attached to various newspapers and bookstores). It is reported that the average salary of employees is about 30 yuan, and the average is less than 25 yuan. However, there is no regulation on working hours, and sometimes it even exceeds 14 hours. Before the war, it was still possible to maintain a family of several people with this level of living. However, since the war, the treatment has not improved, and the lives of the employees have long been in a state of semi-starvation. Because of the high pressure of life, their families have repeatedly requested the management to improve their treatment. Most employees, feeling the special environment, understanding the need for labor-management coordination, and enduring the pain, are unwilling to act rashly. Now, in order to further express their demands, the employees have put forward specific requirements to the management. If their lives cannot be resolved, they will go on strike to urge the management to understand. It is reported that the price of photo copper and zinc plates was at most 8 cents per square inch before the war, but later, due to the increase in raw material prices, it rose to 1.5 cents, then to 2 cents, and soon to 2.5 cents. Since March 1, the new price has risen to 5 cents per square inch.</p>
<p>Bookbinding Industry Asks for Double Salary</p>
<p>Due to the impact of rising prices, the bookbinding workers in the book industry are experiencing difficult lives. Now all the workers have requested the management to increase their wages by two times to solve their urgent needs. Before the January 28th Incident, the wages for male and female workers in this industry were 1 yuan and 10 cents per 10,000 pages. Although wages were increased to 1 yuan and 34 cents to 56 cents per 10,000 pages from October of last year, they still felt that it was not enough due to the soaring prices.</p>
<p>Cotton Mill's Strike Spreads</p>
<p>Recently, all the workers in more than 50 cotton mills in the city went on strike because their request for management to improve their treatment was not granted. For a time, the workers in other factories responded in groups. Only the workers in the Meifeng Cotton Mill at 112 Pinlang Road, West Shanghai, did not participate and continued to work as usual. The striking workers believed that they were disrupting the strike, so they sent people to the factory the day before yesterday, threatening that they must join the strike yesterday. Until yesterday, the workers in the factory still worked as usual. The striking workers learned about this and gathered 200 workers at noon yesterday to rush to the factory, destroying the glass doors and windows and miscellaneous items in the factory to prevent work from being carried out. After receiving the news, the police quickly dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene to suppress the strike and arrested several workers who caused the trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Tomorrow is the Anniversary of the Recovery of Songhu: Celebrations Enthusiastically Held by All Sectors; Loyal Comrades' League Encourages Compatriots <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow (January 28th) is the anniversary of the recovery of the Songhu area by the National Revolutionary Army. All sectors of the city are unanimously preparing to celebrate enthusiastically. However, due to the special environment, it has been decided not to hold any ceremonies, but to uphold the policy of resistance and national reconstruction with perseverance, and to complete the mission of final victory. The Loyal Comrades' League of the Kuomintang also issued a letter to the compatriots of the city as follows:</p>
<p>Recalling today in the 16th year of the Republic of China, Generalissimo Chiang led the army on the Northern Expedition, and the party army advanced to the shores of Shanghai. The army and people cooperated to recover the local area. The Shanghai party members rose up in anger, and the masses responded. The warlords collapsed at the sight of the wind and fled in panic. For more than ten years, the remnants of evil have been swept away without a trace. Local tyrants and evil gentry have been executed to eliminate harm for the people and punish traitors for the country. National prestige has been restored, and the people's spirit has been revived. The Republic of China has been reborn, thanks to the sincerity of our Generalissimo and the loyalty and bravery of our party's advanced members. At that time, our party comrades were truly "vanguards of the people, working tirelessly day and night," so they were able to create this glorious and great historical record that will last forever. At this time, the Generalissimo is supervising the army in battle, and the news of victory from the front-line generals is frequently reported. The final victory can be expected soon. I hope that our Shanghai comrades will work even harder, lead the masses, be loyal to the party and the country, and not hesitate to die. We will emulate the fighting spirit of the martyrs and add glory to our Songhu commemoration. Let us encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Rice and Cloth Situation Worsens Daily: Emergency Measures are Urgently Needed; There is no Shortage of Precedents for Taking Special Measures; Poor People are Robbing Rice Again, Order is Already Concerning <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that semi-official figures predicted today (the 18th) that the result of the extraordinarily high rice prices in Shanghai would be rampant thieves and repeated robberies and other crimes. It is said that the city authorities should immediately take "decisive measures" to prevent this danger.</p>
<p>Authorities Should Adopt</p>
<p>Half of the measures currently adopted by the Municipal Council can be said to be illegal. For example, with regard to the curfew, the Municipal Council has no sovereignty to enforce it, but the council enforces the curfew and arrests people during the curfew for the sake of public safety and the interests of the International Settlement. This is an extraordinary measure. Accordingly, the Municipal Council can also adopt extraordinary measures to prevent the rice situation from worsening. The actions of the Municipal Council only need to be approved by the Consular Body. Any action taken for the benefit of the citizens will undoubtedly be supported by the Consular Body.</p>
<p>Poor People Rob Rice on Broadway Road</p>
<p>This morning, there was another incident of poor people robbing four bags of rice carried by a wheelbarrow on Broadway Road, which shows that the rice situation is worsening. Rice prices continued to rise today. The authorities of the International Settlement officially announced this morning that a board meeting will be held tomorrow afternoon (the 19th) to discuss the city's rice situation, or they will agree on measures to control rice speculation and hoarding, which will be adopted by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Today's Meeting is Worth Noting</p>
<p>The authorities of the two settlements are actively carrying out effective and concrete measures to stabilize the rice market. However, for the sake of prudence, after a certain measure is drafted, it must be studied several times to ensure that it has effective results after implementation. In view of the fact that rice merchants, who are driven by profit, are rampant and rice prices are rising endlessly, the contacts have been unusually busy in recent days in order to implement effective measures and stabilize the people's food as soon as possible. According to rumors, the Food Subcommittee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held another consultation yesterday afternoon and put forward all the existing stable food measures for discussion. The members all expressed better opinions. The established plan will be submitted to today's regular meeting of the Municipal Council for discussion and decision-making.</p>
<p>Price Evaluation Measures are Equal to Setting Up a Sham</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency, the Rice Trade Association had sent representatives to visit Mr. He Dekui of the Shanghai Municipal Council to discuss the current difficulties in purchasing and retailing foreign rice that exceeds the limited price by more than 20 yuan, and asked for a solution. Mr. He agreed to consider it, so a decision will also be made at today's meeting. A reporter learned from the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Association yesterday that the association did not hold a meeting yesterday, but it is understood that the association had prepared a report and submitted it to the Municipal Council, detailing the difficulties in implementing the prices of various grades of foreign rice evaluated on February 3. However, the association is almost equivalent to setting up a sham when rice merchants are rampant. If the authorities do not issue new instructions and strictly supervise, it will be difficult to have an effective effect on stabilizing the rice market.</p>

<h3 id="e79">America Clearly Expresses: Will Not Hesitate to Resort to Force; Strive to Help China Sanction Aggression; Roosevelt Gives Final Warning to Japan; English-Language "China Press" Commentary Yesterday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" commented that we hope that Japanese politicians can read President Roosevelt's speech in detail. We also hope that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, who is on a journey in Siberia, Japanese naval officers on the coast of Vietnam, and Japanese army officers south of Yichang can also close their eyes, think deeply, and understand the remarks made by President Roosevelt. We have this hope because this move will definitely be beneficial to the country's future.</p>
<p>Accepting Provocations, No Longer Tolerating</p>
<p>When President Roosevelt and other American leaders make speeches condemning aggressors, the first to be criticized must be Germany. However, if the Japanese believe that the United States has no resentment towards them, they are completely wrong. In his speech, the President has almost clearly stated that the United States will never allow Japan to further invade American interests, and also stated that if Japan continues to make provocative moves in Malaya and the South Pacific, the United States will take action. In short, if Japan wants to "stir up trouble" and "ask for trouble", then they can achieve their wishes at this time, because the United States will no longer retreat. The President's speech is also tantamount to warning Japan that you have made grand pronouncements in the past, repeatedly made false threats, and bullied small and weak nations. You have raised your fists and drawn your swords, wanting to try it out, so why not just come and try it. However, you will eventually find that we are now prepared.</p>
<p>Deeply Hating Aggressors</p>
<p>What the President's speech shows is that America's enemy is not just Germany. All Axis countries engaged in aggression are America's enemies. Once Japan colludes with Germany to form an alliance against democratic countries, the United States will recognize Japan as being in the same camp as Germany and Italy. From the perspective of the United States, it deeply hates all aggressors and will not discriminate based on the geographical boundaries of Europe and Asia. Since Japan has fallen into the quagmire with clumsy actions, how to get out of this abyss depends on Japan itself. If it only relies on making false claims to seek to extricate itself, the result will be that it will sink deeper and deeper until it is beyond rescue.</p>
<p>Decided to Help China in Heroic Battle</p>
<p>We have an even greater hope that the Japanese people can also read the President's speech carefully, because we hope that the Japanese people can study the following American sentiments: "Our goal should be to make the dictatorships in both Europe and Asia no longer doubt our unity." "The Nazi Party and all those hypnotized by it call this political system a new order." This system is neither "new" nor "orderly". We firmly believe that when our production reaches sufficient levels, the democratic countries of the world will be able to prove that dictators cannot win. We also now have every spare airplane and every other piece of combat equipment, whether new or old, and we will send them abroad." "America is not a country surrounded by appeasers, defeatists, and manufacturers of terror from the back door." "The enemies of democracy have miscalculated, thinking that democracy cannot adjust itself to cope with the terrible facts of the war world." "China...under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, hundreds of millions of people are making heroic and great resistance. They are now calling to us, and America has told China that they will get our help." "Our country will implement the slogan of our people and become the arsenal of democracy."</p>
<p>Devoted Effort, Will Not Hesitate</p>
<p>Even among the American people, there is no shortage of those who doubt how America can defeat the Axis countries. However, the President announced to them that America will make every effort until it defeats the Axis countries. To what extent can the Axis countries be defeated is not considered. The American people no longer have any fear. This effort by America has reached its highest point. This 100% effort will not be stopped because the sacrifices are too great. We really hope that the Japanese people will no longer have any doubts after hearing the President's speech.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Medical and Pharmaceutical Industries Help Promote Tuberculosis Prevention Movement <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Tuberculosis Prevention Movement, jointly initiated by leaders from all walks of life in the city and the new medical and pharmaceutical industries, held a joint medical conference at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The attendees included Chairman Xu Xiaochu, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Zhiyou, Ding Fubao, former President of the Physician's Association Yu Yunxiu, Dean of Tongde Medical College Gu Yuqi, representative of the Chinese Medical Association Chen Yuru, and more than 30 people including presidents of various hospitals, including Zhang, Gu Nanqun, Tang Yuhan, Zhu Kewen, Jin Rong, and Wang Wanbai. Secretary-General Ding Huikang reported on the trial of the first Tuberculosis Prevention Movement, saying that residents came for examinations very enthusiastically. As a result, a quarter of them were found to have lung diseases and were given free X-ray photography. He deeply felt that this kind of relief work related to national health is not something that can be done by one person or one unit. It is necessary to concentrate the city's medical equipment, cooperate, and jointly eliminate the invisible enemy. Then, Mr. Yuan Ludeng requested that the examination method of this session be improved, and it was proposed that major hospitals should provide free X-ray examinations. Patients who need X-ray photography should be charged the lowest possible fee per film in order to popularize diagnosis. The presidents and physicians of major hospitals present enthusiastically supported this proposal and unanimously passed it. After the decision, Gu Yuqi and Yu Yunxiu successively gave speeches, and bacteriology experts Zhu Yangao, Cheng Mugu, and Yu Yunxiu expressed their willingness to undertake free chemical examination work. Finally, Mr. Xu Xiaochu delivered a speech, saying that new medicine and new drugs are related, and hoped that the medical and pharmaceutical industries will closely cooperate and jointly promote this undertaking for the relief of people's lives. It is reported that the free X-ray examination method passed at the meeting will be held simultaneously in 12 hospitals, including Zhongbi, Da Shanghai, Da Gong, Da Rui, Hongqiao, Nanyang, Tongde, Jardine Matheson, Shanghai Lung Disease, Zhang, and Qu Zhifu, starting from the 16th of next month, which is truly good news for the residents of the city.</p>

It is hoped that members from both local and other places will actively participate.</p>
<h3 id="e82">On the Supreme Principle of All Religions <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>In the eleventh lecture of the Harmony Five Scripture Study Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "The Supreme Principle of One" in all religions, saying: The "Doctrine of the Mean" in the Book of Rites states: "What Heaven imparts is called Nature; to follow Nature is called the Way; to cultivate the Way is called Instruction." It also says, "The Way is that from which we may not deviate for an instant; what may be deviated from is not the Way." Instruction is established based on the Way. If it departs from the Way, where does Instruction exist? The Way arises from following Nature; if not for Nature, where is the Way to be seen? Though there are five Instructions, the Way is only one. To know that the highest philosophies are not different is to know that they are the same in "One." The "Explanation of Characters" (Shuowen Jiezi) explains the character "一" (One) as, "The Way is established in One." Xu Shuozhong, unparalleled in the Five Classics, his saying is trustworthy and verifiable. The Way is established in One; thus, "One" is the origin of the Way. Let us cite the teachings of various religions to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Confucianism</p>
<p>Since Fu Xi created the Bagua with a single stroke, opening the heavens and establishing instruction, the sages have passed it down, jointly elucidating the principle of "Only One." Xunzi's "On Ritual" states, "The Way of the hundred kings is simply One." Mencius's "Teng Wen Gong" states, "The Way is only One." These all inherit Confucius's saying, "My Way is consistent with One," and "I connect everything with One." What exactly does "One" mean? Jia Gongyan's commentary on the Zhouli (Rites of Zhou), Xing Bing's commentary on the Xiaojing (Classic of Filial Piety), and Kong Yingda's commentary on the Zuozhuan (Zuo Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals) all say, "One is the beginning of numbers." Wang Bi's commentary on Laozi also says, "One is the beginning of numbers and the limit of things." The beginning is described in the "Dry Plan of the Weft of the Yi," "The Yi begins with One," the "Spring and Autumn Metaphysical Destiny Wrap," "The nature of yin and yang arises from One," the "Da Le" in the Lüshi Chunqiu, "Created from Taiyi (Grand One)," the "Li Yun" in the Book of Rites, "Rooted in Taiyi." The limit is described in the "Life Instructions Explanation" of the Lost Zhou Book, "Its limit is One." Therefore, Yu Fan's "Meaning of the Yi" says, "Taiji is Taiyi." Hui Dong's "Notes on Reading the Shuowen" says, "One is Taiji." Furthermore, according to the annotation on the chapters "On People," "The Ruler's Duty," and "The Principles of Transgression" in the Lüshi Chunqiu, "One is the Way." Its annotation on the "Spiritual Instructions" in the Huainanzi says, "One refers to the Way," and "One is the Way." Yu Chuozhen annotates, "The origin of the Way," and "The gate of the Way." Guiguzi's Yin Fu says, "The Way is the beginning of heaven and earth, One is its discipline." Lu Dian's annotation on Guanzi says, "One is the beginning of primordial qi," and Liu Xin's "Three Unifications Calendar" says, "The Way relies on its One." Thus, Han Fei's "Yang Quan" states, "The Way is unparalleled, therefore it is called One." Shao Kangjie's "Innate Learning" says, "Heaven differentiates and transforms within One, and humans create order in their hearts." His explanation is clear and detailed. Furthermore, the "Outer Chapters on Observing Things" state, "The heart is Taiji," and "The Way is Taiji," which is the same as the ancient "Three Tombs," "One is Taiji." If so, nature, numbers, qi, yin and yang creation, rites, music, laws, and governance all begin with One, which is to say they all originate from the Way. Truly, Zhao Qi's commentary on Mencius says, "That which settles the world is but One Way." Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean states that the three universal virtues and nine standards are "the means by which to practice it." Hence, we know that "One" is the origin of philosophy.</p>
<p>Taoism</p>
<p>Zhuangzi's "Heaven and Earth" quotes, "It is recorded that understanding One completes all things." This inherits Laozi's meaning of "Embracing One" and "Attaining One," and the Yi Jing's principle of "Constancy in One" and "Attaining Oneness." Liu Xi said, "Considering all things, this One determines them." Han Bo said, "One penetrates all, exhausting everything without contemplation." The "Ring Flow" chapter of Guanzi states, "Emptiness is called One." Yin Zhizhang annotates the "Inner Governance" of Guanzi, "One refers to nothingness." Meng Jingyi discusses, "One is called the subtle." Li Shan's annotation on the Selections of Refined Literature says, "Subtle existence is called One," which is the same as Zhuangzi's "unformed," Huainanzi's "formless," Lüshi Chunqiu's "cannot be formed," and Guo Xiang's "having spirit" and "utmost subtlety," all referring to the Yi Jing's "Spirit is without direction, and change is without substance," and the Tai Xuan's "Darkly extending myriad categories without showing its form." The Six Secret Teachings quotes, "The Yellow Emperor said, 'One is the ladder to the Way, nearly divine.'" Ruan Ji's "General Discussion on Laozi" states, "The Yi calls it Taiji, the Spring and Autumn Annals call it Yuan (beginning), and Laozi calls it the Way." The "Sayings of Mingdao" states, "Its location is called Yi, its principle is called the Way, and its function is called Spirit." "Zhengmeng" in the "Participation and Opposition" chapter states, "One is therefore spiritual," and also says, "Existence and non-existence, concealment and manifestation, spiritual transformation, nature, and life are all unified without duality." Therefore, to call it Yi, Xuan (mystery), the Way, Spirit, or Subtlety are all different names for the use of the same "One" essence.</p>
<p>Buddhism</p>
<p>The Four Gates of the Tripitaka state, "Non-duality is called One," and "Not one, not different, is named Oneness." The commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra states, "The One True Dharma Realm is the profound and subtle body." The "Expedient Means" chapter of the Lotus Sutra states, "In the Buddha lands of the ten directions, there is only the One Vehicle Dharma. Only this One Reality exists; the other two are not true." The "Treasure Cave" states, "The One Vehicle is the ultimate Way without duality, therefore it is called One." The "Essentials of Transmitting the Mind" states, "One is all, and all is One." Zen Master Yongjia said, "One nature perfectly penetrates all natures, one dharma universally contains all dharmas, and one moon universally appears in all waters." This is because cause and effect are non-dual, the capable and the capable are as one, and all transformations are included in the "One" of my Buddha.</p>
<p>Christianity</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:6 states, "One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all." God is also translated as "Spirit," which is "Monotheism" and "The Uniqueness of God." Therefore, John 1, 4, and 14 take God as the Way, the Truth, and the source of life.</p>
<p>Islam</p>
<p>The Celestial Ritual Classic states, "Only present the True Sovereign, Unique and without form, Lord of the great earth, creating people and things." The Hidden Secret Classic states, "The One Truth evolves, principles and phenomena are displayed." The "Investigation of the Origin of the Way" states, "One Reality is divided into ten thousand, human and divine principles are complete." In the interpretation of the Five Pillars, it uniquely emphasizes the principle of "Oneness of Nature." This all-knowing and all-powerful Lord of Christianity and Islam is the "Spirit" without fixed form or substance of the Yi Jing.</p>

<p>Cheng Zeyi, a 24-year-old Fudan University student from Suzhou residing at No. 3, Lane 834, Connaught Road, was riding in his private car, license plate 3895, yesterday at noon. Cheng was driving himself, intending to return home for lunch, when suddenly two bandits, one armed with a Mauser pistol and the other with a handgun, blocked his path on Xinzha Road. They jumped into the car and sped off west. As they approached the wire mesh barricade at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, the bandits, fearing a search by the guards, accelerated through the barrier and onto Yuyuan Road. The officers stationed near the barrier, seeing the car suddenly break through, suspected something amiss and gave chase, sounding their sirens. Realizing their predicament, the bandits stopped in front of the Yunfei Motor Company branch, pushed Cheng out of the car, and sped away without a trace. Although Cheng escaped abduction, the car remained missing as of last night.</p>

<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that at 5:30 AM this morning (the 18th), three Japanese individuals emerged from a gambling den on Haig Road, boarded a Xiang Sheng taxi, and proceeded east on Avenue Edward VII. Zhuji, the Japanese individuals instructed the driver to head to Hongkou. When the driver refused because Xiang Sheng taxis do not travel to the northern districts, one of the Japanese men attempted to seize the steering wheel, while the other two restrained the driver. As a result, the driver lost control, the wheels veered, and the car crashed into the storefront of a Chinese shop at No. 11 of Avenue Edward VII. The car sustained heavy damage, and the merchandise in the window was destroyed. However, neither the driver nor the Japanese individuals were injured. French Concession police arrived at the scene upon hearing the commotion. Two of the Japanese individuals had already fled. Only one Japanese person was arrested and subsequently handed over to the Japanese Consulate Police for questioning.</p>

The three individuals, with a sudden burst of inspiration at around 7 o'clock the night before, impersonated French Concession detectives and went to the home of Dong Yuzhen, a paint merchant residing at No. 32, Xingsheng Street, accusing him of selling opium and demanding money. Dong saw through Ma and the others' fraudulent intimidation and pretended to cooperate, offering them warm hospitality while secretly using the telephone to inform the French Concession police. A large group of detectives were immediately dispatched to arrest Ma, Bao, and Zhang, along with the victim Dong Yuzhen, and taken to the police station for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Yuan Chang Yarn Firm Massive Fraud Case. Thirty-Four Households Deceived. Fraudulent Funds of Hundreds of Thousands After Thirteen Days of Business. Case Complex, Police Investigating Rigorously. <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The yarn exchange market in this city recently experienced a period of chaos. The reason for this was that the Yuan Chang Yarn Firm, No. 6, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, broker in the market, sold a large number of forged Yu Feng Yarn Factory warehouse receipts. After the customers discovered the fraud, they reported it to the Central Police Station. Chinese detectives Yang Peisheng and Kang Zengxiang and others arrested Yuan Chang employees Wang Yating, Pan Zeru, and Tao Yuantai. The manager of the firm, Zhou Zhonghou, has fled. Detectives investigating the case have discovered that in addition to Zhou Zhonghou, there were also Su Zuyu and Wu Mingzeng who manage the firm. Su is the owner of the Nanyang Cloth Factory on Shanxi Road, and Wu is an assistant manager at the Jiaxiang Cotton Cloth Shop on Shandong Road. Thirty-four households have been defrauded and the amount of money defrauded has reached 530,000 yuan.</p>
<p>List of Defrauded Firms</p>
<p>Total (1) Dadecheng 15,720 yuan, (2) Yuansheng 7,440 yuan, (3) Leji 7,880 yuan, (4) Qingyu 7,780 yuan, (5) Huichang 17,380 yuan, (6) Yongfu 18,990 yuan, (7) Yongfeng 8,700 yuan, (8) Yongji 17,740 yuan, (9) Yiji 8,720 yuan, (10) Hongren 17,400 yuan, (11) Yongshengfeng 26,040 yuan, (12) Leji 8,650 yuan, (13) Jiuji 8,610 yuan, (14) Fengtai 8,690 yuan, (15) Xiangfeng 20,220 yuan, (16) Yiji 17,720 yuan, (17) Guangweixin 26,650 yuan, (18) Yongfengyu 8,875 yuan, (19) Zhenfeng 9,010 yuan, (20) Dafeng 17,658 yuan, (21) Dadecheng 8,790 yuan, (22) Taichang 8,800 yuan, (23) Tongbaoxiang 17,600 yuan, (24) Juda 8,810 yuan, (25) Qinji 17,440 yuan, (26) Defeng 8,745 yuan, (27) Changtai 53,030 yuan, (28) Zhenfeng 17,490 yuan, (29) Rongfeng 8,720 yuan, (30) Xinkang 8,710 yuan, (31) Hongli 17,420 yuan, (32) Tongshengquan 17,600 yuan, (33) Changfeng 17,580 yuan, (34) Ruichangxing 26,440 yuan. When the police solved the case, they learned that some of the customers had not yet collected the cheques they had paid. Therefore, they immediately applied to the court for a stop-payment order and managed to seize 150,000 yuan. However, 386,000 yuan had already been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Complex Inside Story</p>
<p>In total, the Yuan Chang firm operated for only thirteen days, but its earnings amounted to a huge sum of money. The speculative atmosphere can be seen. In the afternoon, the case was heard by Judge Feng of the Special First Court. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wan Weijian and others to defend them. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them for forging documents and defrauding property under the criminal law. He also said that when the police went to various money houses and banks for payment, 8,660 yuan at the Fukang Money House had not been withdrawn. They immediately notified the money house to temporarily stop payment, which the money house agreed to. However, when the court's stop-payment order was delivered in the afternoon, the money had already been withdrawn. Whether the money house is suspected of assisting is something that the police may have to prosecute. Also, Ruichangxing and Shenyu, two of the plaintiffs, did not immediately report the forged warehouse receipts, but instead went to Wuchang to obtain money paid by other firms to compensate for their own losses. This is illegal, and the police are considering whether to prosecute them. Also, the Yuan Chang firm has a shared account at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The Yanyie Bank has a shared account, and the introducer of the shared account is Wu Yuji. The police's investigation found that Wu Yuji is the wife of a giant Wu in a certain institution in western Shanghai. The investigation is still ongoing. After Judge Feng questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e93">"There's No Way" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are so many people who rely on "there's no way" to eat and do things, as many as bugs in June!</p>
<p>Some are "straight to the point": "There's no way to do this!"</p>
<p>Some are "roundabout": "We have to find a way in a situation where there's no way!"</p>
<p>Some are "rubber band style": "Saying there's a way is really no way; saying there's no way maybe there's still a way."</p>
<p>The result? All roads lead to Rome, it's all just "there's no way"!</p>
<p>In fact, things depend on people's actions. There is absolutely no such thing as "there's no way" in the world. If you are determined that "there's no way," then that is truly "there's no way"!</p>
<p>Furthermore, solutions don't come to people; instead, people have to go find solutions. Otherwise, when "black and white" become indistinguishable, there will be "no" solutions either.</p>
<p>Do you want to find a solution when there is a way? Or do you want to find a solution when there is no way? (Besides, the solution has long been there, you just need to "do" it).</p>

<p>— Zhi Ru</p>
<p>Darkness and stuffiness fill my little house, making me feel bored and annoyed. It's already late spring, but I'm still wearing thick, hard steel armor. I think this might shorten my life. I've wanted to leave many times, to get out of this demonic cave. I don't want darkness and a prison-like life; I want light, I want freedom. But I'm locked up by that "fellow," so I'll never move on my own, let alone leave this little house.</p>
<p>Finally, the lock opens and that "fellow" walks in. He opens the lock with a small bunch of metal things, then climbs into my belly and controls my organs. I slowly crawl out. That "fellow" is not a good thing. I remember; he often mistreats me. When I'm hungry, he never gives me a drink until I get sick and can't move. Then he cleverly brings the owner to take a look. The owner gives him a few colorful pieces of paper, and only then does he give me some "food" and I regain my usual spirit and action... In short, that "fellow" is not a good thing. Today he's here again to command me to go out. I guess there won't be any rest tonight.</p>
<p>Now I'm flying on a flat road. He controls my organs and doesn't slow down because of the cold wind or the crowded pedestrians, but just speeds forward like the wind. Suddenly, at a crossroad, a thin, tall person is walking slowly. That "fellow" seems to be blind and continues to make me fly forward like a shot. I'm scared, I'm scared I'll hit him and make him bleed! Stop! Yes, I want to shout: "Get out of the way! Get out of the way!" But that "fellow" seems to have forgotten to press my organ. Closer! Closer! My body is shaking a little. I want to shout, but I can't. Finally, I'm cruelly run over by that "fellow." At that moment, that "fellow" seems to realize it and shouts and curses in a rough voice, and presses my organ with his hand, but it's too late. My shout is not what I wanted to shout just now: Get out of the way! Get out of the way! But! Alas! Dead, alas! A sigh of death. The owner also wakes up from his reverie and subconsciously sticks his head out to take a look at the people surrounding him and the dead man lying on the ground -- beside my body. "Oh!" He doesn't seem afraid or cold-hearted about this tragic bloodshed, just hums like this lightly.</p>
<p>A man in yellow clothes comes over and talks to the owner for a few words. The owner takes a few colorful pieces of paper and proudly tells that "fellow" to make me crawl again. On the owner's smiling face, he seems to be saying: It's okay! It's okay! I don't understand how the magic power of these colorful papers is so great. That "fellow" has the colorful papers and comes to harm me; that man in yellow clothes has the colorful papers and "doesn't care about death." Ah, I'm curious, curious why these colorful papers, and those crowded people around, why I feel strange things that they don't feel strange at all? They're the same kind! I still don't understand whether life and colorful pieces of paper are more valuable?</p>

<p>— Ya Yue</p>
<p>Manager Zhang, who usually only reads business news and movie advertisements in the newspaper, has been paying attention to big headlines these days. When he sees people, he will also say something like: "Hey! The US and Japan are about to go to war!" or "The concessions are a bit unreliable!" After that, he sighs a few times.</p>
<p>Really, if the US and Japan really go to war and the concessions are unreliable, then Manager Zhang's assets will really have big problems. Therefore, Manager Zhang also pays special attention to the "world situation." But the big headlines these days are always the same: either "The US is preparing to actively participate in the war" or the Japanese Foreign Minister says that the US and Japan will inevitably "fight" -- this is simply poking at Manager Zhang's eggs!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Lust</p>
<p>He rested his brush on the inkstone and kept wiping it. The thoughts in his mind surged like boiling water. He felt that he had too much to say. He originally only wanted to write a short paragraph, which was really not enough. He had to write at least a six- or seven-page letter. He wanted to tell her about his experience learning opera, as well as the situation at home, and his friendship with the Yuan family uncle and nephew, which should also be written very frankly. In addition, he also wanted to express some enthusiastic sympathy for the other party's unfortunate situation. Finally, he felt that he could add a few words to express his love.</p>
<p>"..." The structure seemed very complete, but when the tip of the brush fell on the paper, a great difficulty arose. He couldn't think of what title to use at the beginning.</p>
<p>He really hated himself for not being a little braver just now, and asking her first. As long as he knew what her name was in school, the title would be easy. Now, if he just bluntly wrote "Madam, your letter is reviewed," or "Miss, your letter is reviewed," it would not only be a bit lacking, but also make the other party laugh when they saw it.</p>
<p>This question consumed two or thirty minutes of thinking. In the end, he decided not to use any title at all, and wrote the first line like this:</p>
<p>"I was born unfortunate. At the young age of two, I was abandoned into the Yuzhen Opera Troupe as a child actor because of my father's death, poverty at home, and an elderly mother. What is even more painful is that the teacher acted as he pleased, ordering me to specialize in female roles, forcing a man to lose his complexion and put on makeup, dressing up as a daughter, which is really extremely shameful! ..."</p>
<p>Writing like this, there is indeed a lot of material. Not to mention six or seven pages, even if you want to write full sixty or seventy pages, it is probably not difficult. But he thought, would Luo Xiangqi be willing to spend so much effort to read his little biography? At the same time, he also felt that instead of rambling on for a long time and not arousing the other party's interest, it would be better to write shorter and more brilliantly.</p>
<p>"This time I came to Tianjin, I gained nothing, but in a predicament, I was able to see your beautiful face, which is something I am privately delighted about ... "</p>
<p>This time, he decided to limit it to three pages at most, but after writing two lines on the first page, he felt that if he continued to write like this, it would definitely be another long article. It was because since he said "privately delighted," of course he had to say the reason for his delight, at least he had to tell her about the tedium of his past life, and he couldn't avoid inserting a passage praising her. Once this was spread out, how could it be contained? Helplessly, he had to tear up the second letter again.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Cat and Mouse Analogy <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Si</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper (One)</p>
<p>A newspaper in Chongqing recently published an article entitled "Cats and Mice." Its meaning is to compare those who hoard and speculate in various provinces and regions of China today to cats, and the common people like us to mice. The article also quoted the story of a group of mice resisting a cat, but ultimately failing because they could not tie a bell to the cat's foot, to satirize the difficulty of price control today.</p>
<p>However, after reading this article, I feel that this analogy is inappropriate. -- We know that the failure of a group of mice to resist a cat is because mice are inherently pests, and raising cats to eliminate pests is also the truth! As for tying a bell to a cat's foot, it is inherently beyond the capabilities of mice. Like treacherous merchants and powerful officials who hoard and speculate, although they are cunning and treacherous, they cannot be said to have any special privileges that allow them to devour ordinary people like us at any time and any place. Why should we consider ourselves mice and allow them to devour us? Furthermore: if we consider ourselves mice, then we can only listen to the fat-headed and big-eared flower cats' arrangements. If not, then we must know that the hoarders and speculators among treacherous merchants and powerful officials are definitely not comparable to cats. The so-called price control is also not like the difficulty of tying a bell to a cat's foot, because "it is for the elders to break off a branch; it is not that they cannot do it, but that they do not do it."</p>
<p>Manager Zhang began to feel annoyed and melancholic...</p>
<p>Many people offer him advice: his son advises him to invest in the interior, but he scolds his son for being unfilial, wanting to invest the money that his father has worked so hard to "earn" in water; of course, he does not agree with this opinion.</p>
<p>His wife advises him to buy gold bars and hide them at home. However, Manager Zhang is very timid, fearing that once it is exposed, both his "gold" and his "life" will be lost, resulting in nothing. -- This suggestion was rejected by him.</p>
<p>Relatives advise him... He doesn't agree!</p>
<p>Friends advise him... He doesn't agree!</p>
<p>Manager Zhang is gradually getting thinner, worrying about his property...</p>
<h3 id="e98">"Qi" (Anger/Frustration) <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Qishui</p>
<p>After being "angered," everyone wants to "vent"; but one should vent properly.</p>
<p>If it's "anger" suffered among one's own people, it's okay to suffer "anger" from "outsiders," but if it's something that absolutely must be "vented"! Then it's something that should rightly be "vented," otherwise one is not a "Chinese son or daughter."</p>
<p>However, demolishing fences, burning haystacks, throwing flowerpots, smashing glass, is not "venting anger," it's "unleashing a torrent," not a good method, and it's hard to guarantee there won't be more "bloodshed" in the future!</p>
<p>For the "championship," for the "championship," for "watching the excitement," over thirty thousand "fans" spent over thirty thousand dollars (perhaps more), and returned "angered," it would be better to look more at the "friends" outside the "arena" who are waiting to be fed, which would be more worthwhile. Of course, both this watching and that watching require buying tickets (rice porridge tickets).</p>
<p>But having said that, if one has suffered enough "anger," what use is "anger" alone?</p>
<p>Don't "be angry," just "remember"! Don't forget to "remember"!</p>

<h3 id="e99">Why I Filmed "The Great Dictator" <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Charlie Chaplin, Translated and Selected from "Column Magazine"</p>
<p>I believe the most laughable thing in the world is mocking those in high positions. The higher the position of the person you satirize, the greater the chance of success for your comedy. —— Hitler should be the biggest target; in the current world, there is no better object of satire and ridicule than him. —— This is why I am happy to film "The Great Dictator."</p>
<p>Some suggest that my filming of this movie has a propaganda purpose, which is far from the truth. I am not interested in this type of propaganda —— most propaganda contains lessons and is incredibly foolish. The reason I made "The Great Dictator" is because I hate dictators, and I want to make the audience laugh.</p>
<p>If I have any other motive for making this film besides entertaining the audience, I can guarantee it is definitely not propaganda.</p>
<p>I have no connection to politics and no special impressions of political science, but I believe I am a philanthropist, as every artist imagines themselves to be. I don't like to see one person or one system dominating a group of lowly, helpless people.</p>
<p>When I started making "The Great Dictator," I did not expect the film to be shown in Germany. In terms of business, a high-ranking Nazi official informed me of this —— he wrote to Josef Breen of the film industry association.</p>
<p>The Nazi protest was as follows: ——</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Breen: I saw an article in the newspaper titled "Charlie Chaplin will play Hitler," which stated that Mr. Chaplin will play a cowardly little Jew who is mistaken for a powerful dictator because the other role he plays is the dictator himself."</p>
<p>"The article also states that the Führer played by Chaplin is never discovered by great detectives like Solomon or Sherlock Holmes. Although Hitler's surname is naturally not mentioned in this article, if this news is confirmed, it will cause serious difficulties and disturbances. Please consider this point."</p>
<p>I hope this film can be shown in all totalitarian countries. In fact, I have prepared several copies of this film, available free of charge for any totalitarian country to show. Someone assured me that "The Great Dictator" would be popular with audiences if it were shown in totalitarian countries.</p>
<p>For me, the impact of this film on my own future is secondary. To enhance the value of the plot, I have given other actors, such as Jack Oakie and Miss Paulette Goddard, extremely demanding tasks.</p>
<p>Although most of the characters in "The Great Dictator" are easily recognizable to the audience and can be identified as famous figures in contemporary politics, my intention is not to allude to anyone. I have tried my best to capture the feeling: you, I, and all those who hate dictators, may have the same face as Hitler or Mussolini.</p>
<p>I believe that under the cold exterior of Hitler seen in newsreels, there is actually hidden the nature of a tiny, despicable, and inferior neurotic. Mussolini's personality is completely different from him —— strong, unsettling, conceited, but at heart, a villager.</p>
<p>When making "The Great Dictator," many serious problems did arise. The world market, which was once closely related to my films, has greatly shrunk, and the cost of making this film is extremely high. This sum will be largely recovered from the American audience.</p>
<p>However, I still hope that China, Central America, and South America will ease the ban on showing this film. I feel that if they see the dictator in the same way we do, their interest in dictators will be lessened.</p>
<p>In fact, I am not concerned about whether "The Great Dictator" can make money. First, I must make it a good film —— I must make the audience laugh. If in a world, people cannot laugh at all, then this world is hopeless.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Random Notes from the Art Scene <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Shouwu</p>
<p>Last night, "Zhonglv" (China Travel Troupe) had Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Xi Jiabao, and Wu Chengda come forward at the Guangming Cafe to entertain the press for reasons unknown. Awaiting an "official report" for further details. One can guess beforehand that it is related to the repertoire and location of the performance.</p>
<p>The repertoire for "Zhonglv's" revival is tentatively set as "Hong Xuanjiao," written by Wei Ruhui and directed by Fei Mu. However, if time is short, whether it can be performed as scheduled is still a question. As for the performance location, the more likely possibility is the Lyceum Theatre, because the Tianfeng Company has already organized its own "Tianfeng Troupe" at the Swatow Road location. Although manpower is insufficient, the first performance, "Sunrise," is essentially borrowed entirely from the Dongwu Drama Society. But in any case, Tianfeng must perform at least one show, during which "Zhonglv" will not be able to perform at the Swatow Road location again.</p>
<p>"Tianfeng's" first performance being "Sunrise" is quite disappointing to those who care. Viewed in isolation, "Sunrise" is indeed a good play, and among Cao Yu's three plays, "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," and "Wilderness," "Sunrise" has the strongest social significance. However, "Sunrise" has been performed so often and so poorly in Shanghai that if the performance cannot surpass previous performances, its "flavor" will be very bland. Because Tianfeng's performances should be different from some "autumn wind operas," they cannot just randomly gather some so-called movie stars to put on a show, exploitatively perform some "cold plate" plays like "Sunrise," and consider that they have fulfilled their responsibility to the drama movement. Unless the foundation of Tianfeng's organization lies in "stars" and not in "drama."</p>
<p>"World's Children" has decided to start filming as scheduled on the 26th. It is said that the first scene will be an interior shot of a hospital, and the first shot is internally set to be the scene of Zhang Yi, the male lead and production director of the film. Due to the intensity of work, the "Friendship Gathering" originally planned after the completion of "Song of Ancient China" will likely be canceled to concentrate efforts on "World's Children." Or, it will be held after the completion of "World's Children."</p>

<p>Although there is no destiny, there is causality. The transformation of adversity, the weaknesses of adversity, the factors of new things are all natural causes. The stimulus of force accelerates the change of things, which is a man-made cause. The evolution from various causes to a certain situation is reality, whether it is success or failure, these are all effects.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Making One Remember Lord Pingyuan</p>
<p>At this point, that person had no choice but to say, "Master Li, because I came here and received your hospitality and care, I felt I had no way to repay you. Today, while I was out, I passed a house and saw a famous black horse tied under a green willow tree outside the gate. I knew this horse must have a great origin. Looking over the fence, I saw inside a room, this brawny man with a curly beard and a young man were admiring a treasured saber. There was also a treasured sword, the light of the saber and sword was chilling, making my heart move. I thought to myself that the three things were invaluable and rare, so I decided to steal them at night. If I could steal them and present them to Master Li, it would please him. After all, I have been eating here for a long time, and it wouldn't be a free lunch. Who knew that when I used my flying skills to get there, I saw that there were no swords hanging in the room, probably the owner had hidden them. I was a little disappointed. When I came back out, I saw the black horse tied in the courtyard and wanted to steal it. The people in the house were alarmed and got up to fight me. At first, the young man's skills were very ordinary, but later, this brawny man with a curly beard was highly skilled in martial arts. I couldn't defeat him and was afraid of losing, so I retreated. Unexpectedly, the two of them chased after me relentlessly. I used hidden weapons to injure one of them, but he still chased me here. Now I have alarmed Master Li, and I am extremely ashamed. Since he is unwilling to let me go, I will change my weapons and fight him to the death here. I would like to ask Master Li to be a witness." After saying that, he ran inside, changed to a pair of iron hammers, raised them high in his hands, and said to Zhang Cangqiu, "Come, come, I will fight you for another hundred rounds." Zhang Cangqiu also held up his treasured saber and said, "Very good, if I lose tonight, I will give you the treasured saber and the famous horse." Just as the two were about to start fighting, the young man waved his spear and stopped them, saying, "So that's how it is, you don't need to fight anymore. As the saying goes, 'Without a fight, there is no acquaintance,' and 'When two tigers fight, one must be injured.' You two are both skilled people, so there's no need to fight fiercely. Let me mediate for you." He then said to Zhang Cangqiu, "I am Li Xin, and I have been living in Qixian here. All my life I have loved making friends with heroes from all over the world. This Chen Fei is a strong warrior and a guest in my house. His light body skills are very good, and his martial arts are also excellent. I never thought that tonight, because of stealing a horse and a sword, I would get to know another hero. May I ask, what is your name? Where are you from? From what I see, you are not from this place." (15)</p>

<p>Game 272: Brave and Skilled in Battle, Proposed by Ma Songliang</p>
<p>In Game 270, "Old Soldier Resolves Peace," the black cannon at 19 should be at 13, and there is a pawn at 11. The red side adds a minister at 93, and the move is the same as before. Also, the cannon 7 retreat 1 was mistakenly printed as advance 1, and the horse 3 retreat 5 was mistakenly printed as retreat 4. This is specially corrected.</p>
<p>Game 271: "Wind and Fire Wheels," the moves are listed below (Red goes first and wins)</p>
<p>Pawn 6 advances to 5, Horse 4 retreats to 5, Chariot 7 advances to 5, General 5 advances to 6, Chariot 5 advances 1, General 6 advances 1, Chariot 7 advances to 4, Chariot 9 advances to 6, Horse 1 advances to 3, General 6 advances 1, Chariot 5 advances to 4, Chariot 8 advances to 6, Horse 3 advances to 2, General 6 retreats 1, Cannon 1 advances 8 (Wins)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Liu Tianhong Talks About Opera <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Shuyi (formerly the child actor Liu Tianhong), who abandoned his acting career to go into business (20 years ago), has not spoken of opera since giving up the red carpet. Although friends and relatives have repeatedly asked him to lecture on the principles of opera, he has always declined, saying his voice is hoarse and he doesn't want to talk much. It is now heard that Mr. Liu's voice has gradually recovered, and after repeated invitations from close friends, he could not refuse due to affection and ability. He finally agreed to research together in his spare time. Therefore, Wang Ziping, E Lügong, Wang Shuishui, Xu Jiepu, Gu Weicheng, Ma Zhishan, etc., organized the Wei Ping Opera Society at Wang Ziping's clinic at 16 Beile Road. Every night at 8 o'clock, they gather in the society to discuss dramatic theory, expressions, singing styles, and techniques. When there are difficult points, they ask Mr. Liu to correct them. Mr. Wang Ziping also teaches the members various martial arts every night after the drama discussion is over, so that the members' physique can be improved and strengthened.</p>
