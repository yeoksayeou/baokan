<h3 id="c5">中美之合作與外交 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>邇來美國援華程序方在積極逐步推進中，據隔昨消息：著名美國東方問題學者拉狄摩氏經美總統推薦，已被任爲中國最高軍政當局之政治顧問；與此同時，以倡導ABC政策著聞國際間之中國新外長郭泰祺氏，於由英倫取道美國東返之後，亦已經滇緬公路行抵陪都，行將就任外長。中國作戰四年來之國際環境，殆以最近期間最形良好，外交機杼乃適於此際應實際需要而有所刷新，美當局復以其最能深切瞭解中國之學者薦於中國，俾收臂助之效，此不惟象徵中國對於美國及各民治國間合作之益臻密切，其於安定遠東之反侵略偉業之完成，亦可想像必能益收促進之宏效。</p>
<p>中國目發動應戰以迄於今，行將屆滿四年，此一非常時期中，自行政軍事以迄建設經濟，無不日新月異，孟晋不已，而其間之功效晤著最爲舉世所明顯目睹者，殆莫如外交。迴憶戰事初起之時，各國人士之同情中國固未必遠遜於今日，而國際政治形勢，方日趨晦黯，即在民治國家亦每懷投鼠忌器之顧慮，以是中國彼時所得於國際助力者，不過一二友邦之局部舉措，爲量亦殊微末，固不僅未能以之搆成民治國家重要國策之一部已也。乃時移事異，舉世鼎沸，曩之未能以切實支援中國杜絕侵略者，茲乃漸决親受戰事慘禍之波及，因以確切體認中國作戰與安定世界秩序之不可分的關聯，援華任務，在民治國之最明智的政治家心目中，始無不以之與對抗納粹侵略等量齊觀，且寖進而出於積極實施。此一隆情厚誼，彌足珍童，此固客觀局勢使然，在中國要非等間倖致者也。試以與四年來之日本相對比：溯自一九三八年五月第一决近衛內閣改組之以宇垣大將入掌外相，即以「解決事變」打開孤立局面之責期之於外交，其間雖內閣更迭數四，無不以外相一席爲內閣生命所寄託，且俱於外交方面深具厚望。然而雖以宇垣野村之重望，有田松岡之長材，政策迭更，嘗試備至，結果不惟無所成熟，且愈挣扎而困頓愈甚，迄於蘇德戰事爆發之後，國際間之友敵親疏，已全告澄淸，獨有日本仍復徘徊其間，無所決策，一如本報昨日社論所指出。多助寡助，分野判然，以外交成敗而言，固足暗示中日雙方前途之歸趨。</p>
<p>然而此並非謂外交之能決定一切也，亦非謂中國之外交成就可以自滿也。戰爭成敗，決於國力總和之對比，外交特其顯而易見之指標耳。歷史上藉對外運用以匡挽國家危運，若遊說之士之於六國，泰勒蘭加富爾之於法義者，事固不乏先例，然決非一般之常軌。國家之國際地位，其高下與其軍事政治經濟文化各方面之綜合的成就爲正比例，且更須視其國策之是否合乎正義與公道，捨此而獨期外交方面之奇蹟，强國如日本，結果且如上述，他更無論矣。更進而檢討今日遠東之國際形勢，世人一向所憧憬之中美英蘇共抗侵略，於今已以蘇德之戰而漸露曙光，誠足快慰；然稽之實際，此一前途，僅在客觀上有其可能，而在英美蘇聯之間，其對於歐亞兩大反侵略戰爭之立塲與利害，固大體相同，而格於實際機緣之未盡成熟，不惟彼此間鮮有平行統一之運籌，其措施亦各自有其不同之機抒。有如美國之重歐輕亞論者，近已大挫鋒芒，而蘇聯之於遠東，則並未與其抗禦納粹等量齊觀，以致嚮之以其東疆安全委之於中立協定與夫商的邊界糾紛之解決者，或竟不免轉瞬將見一九一九年東部西比利亞事件之重演。兩面作戰之爲任何國家所深忌，固不待言，而中美英蘇之聯合力量，實足制壓全世界之侵略而有餘。目前之重大遺憾，即在於此一聯合之策動，在遠東尚付缺如；英蘇此際方集全力於歐陸之大戰，則如何促成此一聯合反侵略陣綫之實現，俾在遠東早收撥亂反正之效，中美雙方負責綦重，而尤爲郭外長與拉狄摩來華後之重責。敢以此意質之中美朝野。</p>

<p>然而對於德國空軍不能估計太低，得到美國援助的英國新空軍，仍須運用全力，方足應付德國未來的攻勢。至於英國陸軍最迫切的需要，就是戰車，更多的戰車。我最近幾個月中所遇到的許多司令官，都在引領企望各工廠製造戰車的速率，能與訓練人員的步驟相應合</p>
<p>某日，我獲得當局的允准，得以目覩正在進步中的趕造戰車新計劃。戰車在秘密工廠中製造的迅速，遠非昔日可比，製成後即送往軍需處，然後分發各營，爲保衛央倫三島或供海外之用。</p>
<p>這些戰車的分配，現在雖以防衛本國爲主，然而一班陸軍將領當然希望即能應用於海外。防守本國的精兵都承認，祇有英國派軍往歐陸正採取大規模攻勢的時　成熟之時，纔能實踐他們防衛本國的任務。</p>
<p>關於戰車製造的數量，以至其他可以使人獲得綫索的種種情形，當然禁止發表。可是我們若知道這種戰車機構的複雜，則於加速製造的重大困難，自可不難明白了。</p>
<p>即以巡邏戰車爲例，其外形校普通的蒸氣滾路機更爲簡單，實則含有六千二百個不同的部份，而有五萬以上不同的機械和配台作用。這種戰車的造價，每噸約値一千鎊，較之一架轟炸機所費的還要貴呢。而且製造戰車的工程，精密異常，有若干處須精　到一英寸的萬分之一。</p>
<p>記者在一個工廠中，即見所用的製造機，有五百種之多，各用電力轉動。一個整塊的鋼板，結果竟能製成一輛完整的戰車，自動開駛，可供馳騁大道或橫貫鄉野的試騐了。</p>
<p>假　你不曾見過戰車，那麽對於道種平衡穩妥而有彈性的車輛，決不能想像到牠的　便活動。重戰車的重量達一十五噸，可以衝　房屋，在崎嶇不平的地面上爬行，安適異常。牠們可以在三秒鐘之內掉轉身來，有如馬球戲中的馬匹一樣靈巧，實際較之平常汽車尤速。</p>
<p>雖然精密得像戰車的機械，不適於大量生產，但是工廠方面仍在勉力設計，以保證同時建造最高數量的戰車。記者看到牠的裝配機構，地位寬展，可使一輛完全的戰車用二十噸重的起重機，吊至另一輛戰車之上。</p>
<p>制造戰車的工廠，除男子外，女子亦有被僱用的，所用機器，各國皆有，甚至有從德國購米的，記者所見機器的名牌上，有漢堡，星星那蒂，俄亥俄和茅特洛等字樣。</p>
<p>和我一同考察的還有兩個從埃及來的英國軍官，他們都說軍隊對於工匠的技巧，已有認識，而中東英軍總司令華維爾將軍更在最近電報中稱：義大利軍戰車，雖多是最新的出品，但並非英國戰車之敵。英軍沙漠巡邏行程所及，不下五十萬英里之遙，但迄無一輛戰車因機件損壞而受損失。</p>
<p>記者曾問一個軍官，英國的戰車比較德國的如何？他根據法比未降以前弗蘭德之戰的經騐答道：「我們可以判斷其優劣的機會很少，可是在每决戰鬥中，英國的戰車似乎都能充分履行其職務。」</p>
<p>這種　騐，當然不能據爲定論，因爲當時英國祇有一個裝甲師團在法國作戰，除了防禦以外，從未有一試身手的機會。鄧扣克撤兵以後，英國連一個裝甲師團也沒有了。那些戰車，都和其他車輛及大砲一樣，都在法國損失殆盡。</p>
<p>反之，德軍却擁有無數的戰車，往往在一千五百碼闊的戰綫，同時有一百輛左右的戰車向前推。德軍始終在戰車的數量上佔着優勢，特別是輕戰車。英軍對輕戰車已不加重視，而在鄧扣克戰役之後，德軍對於英軍所用的重戰車，諒來亦已獲得敎訓了。</p>
<p>此外，英國今日不但在作戰，且在經過一種革命。</p>
<p>此决戰爭，將在何時，何地，及怎樣獲勝，仍在不可知之數，但有件事實已經明白顯出：即今　的英國已和兩年前的英國不同，而在戰爭結束以後的英國，尤將有更劇烈的變化。</p>
<p>英國果將變成怎樣呢？</p>
<p>在美國常聽到這許多疑問　我們所援助的是怎樣一個國呢？英國現在改變到何種程度，戰後又將變成怎樣？會不會變成社會主義化？有沒有國社主義化的危險？」</p>
<p>記者爲要獲得這許多問題的解答起見，曾在英國各地，與農民，工人，工黨領袖，保守黨員，自由黨員，內閣中的兩個工黨代表，社會服務員，和婦女界領袖及其他各式人等，談論此事。</p>
<p>經過一番廣大的調查以後，記者毫無疑惑的相信，英國巳在革命中了。但這是標準的英國式革命，不激烈，不趨極端，也不突如共來，人民更不知有革命。但是這種革命却具有深長的意義，不但是經濟的，同時也是社會的，不但是社會的，同時也是政治的，不僅是戰爭的暫時作用，而實具有永久的性質。</p>
<p>這個革命已使英國的社會情形起了根本的變化，但並不與傳統相背，這是英國標準的特色。這種革命已推翻了若干建立已久的特殊地位，但是道種轉變是逐漸的，溫和的，仍不失爲特殊的英國式革命。</p>
<p>就社會言，醞釀中的大改革，乃是一種平等化作用。若說英國的階級制度已經廢除，却是不對的。階級制度並未廢除，至少在這一代中不會廢除。但是階級的岐視，則已顯然减少。階級制度很有與戰爭和戰後改革並存的可能，但必有許多變動無疑。</p>
<p>在此决戰爭中，各階級人民都同等的出汗流血，這是一個主要理由，而轟炸尤爲平等化的最大推動力。</p>
<p>日前，我與某貴婦晚餐，得知她幾乎每晚睡在地下室內，這地下室本是傭僕的餐室。她的女侍睡在她靠近的床上。地下室中傭僕的起居室，則由敦果區逃來的兩個老年夫婦居住。女主人和他們相處數月，情感日增，每晚就寢以前，必和他們熱烈的擁抱。</p>
<p>再則防空巡邏隊和國內保衛隊，也使危險均等和服務平等的意念增加不少。</p>
<p>在國內保衛隊中，前任將校和園丁，車夫，童僕同列行倫，這是常有的事。紳士和工人常會整夜站立一起，作防禦傘兵的守望員。有時鉛管工人和銀行家，也會被派在同一條街道上巡暹。</p>
<p>在轟炸聲中，「階級觀念」的完全消滅，其例眞是不勝枚舉。今日的英國無疑地已產生了一種新的交誼，新的博愛和熱誠。這種新產物都是道社會革命中最有力和最深遠的一種要素。</p>
<p>經濟上的因素，也使平等化的作用加速進行。富人和小康之家的戰時賦稅抽得最重。所得稅從百分之四十起，收入微薄的可酌予减少至百分之二十五或二十五以下。</p>
<p>但在進款豐厚的，其附加稅已激增至百分之九十，此外還有過分利得稅，那是一種取締居奇牟利的嚴峻辦法，實施以後，無論何種大公司或大企業，每年所得的利潤，決不能超過　九三七年或一九三八年時情形了。</p>
<p>英國取締發國難財的方法，非常嚴密。經記者小心調查以後，聽說與政府簽訂合同的廠家，雖可規避定章，獲得較戰前更多的利潤，但就一般情形說來，在英國要發國難財却是不可能的。（未完）</p>

<p>融五講經社第十八决講經，由沈覺靈君登壇云：本期起，擬爲有系統之講演，非一决可畢，題爲「吾儒應體孔子有敎無類之意，共肩調和五敎之責，」第一節爲五敎之歷史。</p>
<p>吾前講孔子學說，不以儒限，非敢卑儒也，孔子之人格與敎術，因高出世所謂儒遠甚，而儒實因禮記儒行篇孔子語而始尊。儒在我國歷史，關係較久，而道之名早著于其先，未可僅以道家之道當之。論語里仁篇孔子至云「朝聞道，夕死可矣，」禮記中庸篇云，「天命之謂性，率性之謂道，修道之謂敎，道也者，不可須臾離也，可離，非道也。」則知凡言敎者，無一可離道也，離道，非敎也。道之一字，豈道家所得而私，其五敎所共由乎？</p>
<p>今所稱道家之書，以老子莊子爲最古，莊子惟內篇七及天下篇，可信確非僞作，餘篇羼僞者多矣。史遷父子；父談以道先於儒，遷以儒先於道，此由漢之西京，文景崇黃老，武帝尊儒術，一代風氣，旣隨之而變，司馬氏家學，或亦不免受其影饗，而遷之尊孔爲至聖，實具古今特識。</p>
<p>佛學在東漢明帝時始入中國，據資治通鑑，則明帝永平八年也。魏書釋老志云，「釋迦生時，當周莊王九年，春秋魯莊公七年夏四月恒星不見夜明是也。」道家原出老子，釋老志載「泰常八年十月戊戍有牧土上師李譜文來臨嵩岳，云老君之玄孫，昔居代郡桑乾，以漢武之世得道爲牧土宮主，又言二儀之問，有三十六天，中有三十宮，宮有一主，最高者無極至尊，决曰大至眞尊决天覆地載！陰陽眞尊，决洪正眞尊，二敎之宣傳，其靈異如此。今山西大同縣西雲岡石窟，重疊如樓，大小佛像，層層密布，彫鏤精絕，爲東方獨一無二之美術，猶北魏遺蹟也。</p>
<p>至唐而儒釋道並重，獨尊老子爲玄元皇帝，以與國姓同耳。共時耶敎稱景敎，已入中國，據景敎碑所載，實在太宗貞觀九年。回敎亦唐時已入中國，有太宗貞觀二年高宗永徽二年二說，據舊唐書高宗本紀，永徽二年八月乙丑大食國始遣使朝獻，新舊唐書大食傳，均載年不載月日，則永徽二年爲信。要之，此五敎者，在吾國均有歷史之關係，風俗人心，均受其一部份之支配，爲不可捨之事實也。</p>
<p>沈君以年老聲微，由楊中一君補充其義，至五時始畢。</p>

<p>婦女生產是家家所通有、各個婦女所不能免的一件事、我國舊習、向賴穩婆、旣無學識、又缺合理的經騐、遇有委託收生、事前禾能準備、事後復多貽誤、一遇難產、束手無策、小則傷害胎兒大則禍及產婦、家庭之惑於迷信者、也只有求神拜佛、絕不作科學的挽救、一年之中、因這樣而斷送生命於枉死城中者、不計其數、</p>
<p>產科概要</p>
<p>國府敎育行政最高當局、有鑒於此、最近對於女子中學、原有生理課程、明令添加產科概耍、滬埠女校、現有議將實施者、紹衡業醫、於婦產科嘗悉力以從、在北平上海、决第創設助產學校、志在將家家需要、人人應知之常識、普及於一般女同胞之腦中、並曾建議敎育當局、於中等女生灌輸以產科常識、幸當局明令、就女中原有生理課程、添加產科概要、三十年來之志願、今得賢明之當局見諸實施、私竊慶幸、</p>
<p>科學助產</p>
<p>並有本埠敎育界以師資問題詢者、嘗回答道、女中之添產科概要、不是要她們執行助產的業務、也不是要她們研究精深的學理、簡單一句話、就是耍她們明白產科攸關民族的消長、生產是極危險的一件大事、但辦理得法、原可化險爲夷平安無事的、所以家中有懷胎的人、定要事前多多注意、臨事委託得人、事後合理保養、明白了眞理、纔能信仰遵從、所以對于未來的賢妻良母的各女子、必定先敎她在學校裏、深明助產的重要、那就她的家裏、遇着生產、便可科學化了務使「科學生產」四個字，深印入人人的腦海之中、那末、得一胎、生一人、嬰兒健康、產母無恙、人口之繁殖、就是國力的增强、產婦之康寧、庶免民族之削弱、</p>
<p>敎學要點</p>
<p>從這說到助產學常識課程的師資問題、將求諸深通學理的醫師嗎、不、將求諸積有經騐的穩婆嗎、不、必定要特別造就所謂關於產科學上之理論、要說得通、更要說得透、關於助產上之技術、耍講得明、允要講得切、時間有限、要在這短少的時間裏、灌輸那包含着無限意義的要語、必須把握住一個中心問題、將種種的學識、五花八門的講出來、敎學生們上了這一課、好像看了一幕電影片、聽的時候、精神貫注、退課回家、津津有味的向她家人講述、這樣、纔能達到敎育部特令添加產科概要的目的啊、</p>
<p>師資訓練</p>
<p>其次談到師資問題、如果醫師能於產科方面加以參考、自可勝任、即不然、助產畢業生、而又從業三數年的、也可多加預備、而担任其事、但是敎授、本有敎授法、允其是這種科目、非加特殊訓練、難期勝任愉快、現値非常時期、上海爲通商巨埠、文化中心、雖屬孤島、但敎育集中、倒比戰前有過之無不及、即以助產學校而論、有中德·大德·同德·生生·人和·衛生等六校、畢業後執業或就事於醫院的也不少、就愚見而論、應由各校聯合特設師資訓練所、徵集有志的畢業生、加以訓練、便可救濟師資荒了、至於各地需要師資也可遴派合格之人、入所受訓、修習期滿、各歸服務、不是極便而極圓滿嗎、</p>

<p>— 曹文海</p>
<p>昨日接得本報讀者曹文海君來函云、（上略）兒童們生在這個年頭、眞可稱謂「不幸」極了、怎麼呢、那唯一的幸福、就是各個家長給子女們讀書、一個人不讀書、不識字、就等於廢物、可憐一般靑年兒童們、正在手拂書包、好好進學讀書的時候、那上海的環境驟然大變、學校遷移、敎師屢易、莘莘學子、不得安心肄業、</p>
<p>自上海成爲「孤島」後、百物騰漲、生活程度日高、維持一家數口、尚且不易、對於子女們的敎育經費、有產階級的還好、一般專靠薪工活命的家長們、經濟拮据、入不敷出、要他繳付子女們的敎育經費、就要然費苦心了、</p>
<p>在生活程度日高聲中、那學校裏的學費、亦繼長增高、回憶三四年前的小學經費、一學期連書籍十四五元够了、有的公立小學還不滿十元、那多麽的便宜啊、</p>
<p>上年的學費、雖然已經增加、小學一學期至多二十五元、連書籍及一切雜費在內、然而那時的家長們、已不勝其重負了、今年却不得了、小學初級的學費、增加到二十六元、再加書籍及一切雜費、總共算起來要三十四五元、高級尚須再加十元、這是走讀生的話、假使是寄宿生、須再加宿膳費、至於中學的學費、以前走讀生一學期的學費、不果二十餘元、上年漲到四十五元、今年竟漲上一半、出了八九十元的學費、書籍雜費還要外加、高中的學費、居然漲出一百元關外、</p>
<p>學費一切增加、那書籍的價格、當然亦飛黃騰達的了、一個兒童的讀書費、就拿小學來講、一學期連書籍雜費、差不多要四五十元、這樣的增漲、學校當局、並非亦爲是敎聯員的薪水增加、和一切開支浩繁、但是亦決不有如許的鉅數、還須對於一般靠薪工階級的兒童家長們想想、在這個年頭裏活命、是吾能負擔子女這筆鉅大的學費、不能負擔的話、只好輟學不讀、那辦學校的宗旨、是熱心於普及敎育、增强國民智識、今拿辦學校來目爲商店、這是違背辦學的宗旨了、學校當商店來看待、可曉得社會上就要多添幾個失學的兒童們、只好望學與嘆啦、</p>

<p>— 承昭</p>
<p>只消留心過去半年裹的廣告，誰都會發覺今年銀號新開得太多，而且多得可怕。樂觀的說這是上海畸形繁榮，投機發達中應有的現象。但再進一步想想，誰都不會忘掉民初的信交風潮。那時信託公司和交易所的新開，不下於今日，結果便來一個成羣結隊的倒閉，鬧得全金融界恐慌不堪。事後，租界當局乃至中國官方都懊悔事前沒有取締，過於放任。本來，油漆門楣，尚須制定種種規程，予以限制，何况是有關經濟組織及其安危的營利機關。像這種投機事業，更不應任其自然。理由是誰都明白。最近因爲雙馬在漲，銀號因之而倒閉者已有數起；何况國際局面尚在一天加緊一天，前途眞不堪設想。一旦風吹草動，民初信交風潮之類，不免立刻重演於今日。那時上海的問題，又豈僅統治權誰屬問題？叉豈僅市民生計問題？定然還要發生一個整個經濟組織的崩潰問題。姑不談這些，再就目前租界財政而言：只聽見加費加稅，却把這個有益財政而兼具社會政策效果的投機稅置在一邊。在今春納稅西人大會中已有人提出，本刊過去也有人倡議過。現在沈君又爲文提出了。在舊事重提木問題的現在，叉正在雙馬風潮和銀號倒閉風潮之中；望租界當局更三注意之。（編者）</p>
<p>自從戰事發生，各地避難民衆雲集上海。上海居民衆多，資金之集中當然亦因此增加；且因二十七年，北方聯合準備銀行成立。更動旣往各種貿易政策及貨幣政策，資金大量逃避至上海；更因二十八年天津租界受到威脅，北方之資金逃避上海者更甚；二十八年秋，歐戰發生，英遠東屬地施行經濟統制，當地華僑之資本逃避爲數亦鉅。上海雖因華興銀行；中央儲備銀行之成立，及租界事件之擾亂。一時資金雖有逃避香港者，但爲數不多。且不久即形流回，故仍造成資金過度集中之地。</p>
<h3 id="c91">責金之消費不良 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>戰事發生後，上海與全國之交通受阻。內地各種農產與土產在非戰區者，或因交通關係，或因政府禁令，不能運滬；在戰區或游擊區者，多半受嚴格之統制。更因戰區各地固有之戰前新興工業，被毀被佔，故租界之原料，多數要仰給舶來品。但製成之物品，不能運銷國內各地，致使向來資金流動最重要的對象幾完全隔絕。於此資金之正當用途或投資，發生問題。</p>
<h3 id="c92">資金封鎖之漏 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>上海爲國際商埠；且因國軍西遷後政府勢力難能到達。致使有滙價黑市，與黃金非法買賣等現象出現。國府雖有限制提存命令，禁止滙劃貼水，及滙劃制度之防止資金逃避，但不　行之成效。</p>
<p>在租界內剩下之投資途徑，惟工商業及地產與證券，且範圍狹小。於是投機之風盛行。近視者不知遷地爲良，反利用投機事業，興風作浪。造作種種計謀，以圖暴利，此戰銀業號所以勃興之故也。</p>

<p>銀號之組織機構，以代客買賣，從中取佣爲原則，分烚赤，美票，棉紗，公債等各項，極少經營存放事宜。代客交易，普通棉紗每包證金二百元，佣金爲八角，烚赤每條證金二百元，佣金爲一元半。美票每百證金五十元，佣金爲一元。公債每千證金五十元，佣金爲五角。銀號純以取佣爲目的，所以類似賭博之抽頭。據稱成交買賣，以棉紗爲最旺。九時開市至四時止。成交數目每家平均日的二百包。故棉紗一項，佣金收益，亦相當作數此等之銀號，大部係合夥企業。資本五萬至十萬不等。部分租寫字問營業，亦有設店號營業之。以五馬路，四川路及愛多亞路等地段最盛。總計不暇四百餘家之多。近更有棉紗期貨市塲之設立。其組織方式與烚赤聯易會相同，依照交易所方式辦理。交易標的，胥爲期貨。今以棉紗交易所之組織一述。棉紗交易所下爲大紗號或銀號即經紀人。其下有設中號，依附大號營業。以上海棉紗交易所爲憑空買賣集中地，大號爲代客買賣之經紀人。中號爲附於大號之代客買賣中問人。大號以證金繳納於棉紗交易所，由交易所會長。派保管委員負責保管。中號以證金繳納於大號，由大號保管。投磯者實與大號交易，則說金繳於大號。與中號交易，則以證金繳納於中號。即可實行交易。</p>
<h3 id="c94">銀號對於物價間接之影響 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>自從戰事發生，上海與全國交通阻滯，運輸困難；且每受統制。故貨物不能暢流，致使實銷不振，已如上述。但投機者不問供求之有無，但求暫時造謠抬價。儘量囤積現期各貨，獲得搶帽子之利益爲已足。致使造成人爲之供求。使其他一切，水漲船高，層疊而上。而最後之歸着，仍在一般生活不堪負荷之大衆消費者身上。舉今凡足以抑制物價上漲之事，毌論其動機何在，均可謂有益大衆。不意本市金融界，不以此圖。却反利用投機事業，大興賭博類似之銀號，大事便利助長投機與囤積。造作種種計謀，唯恐物價之不漲。</p>
<h3 id="c95">高捐銀號稅之理由與各界之利 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>公家支出膨脹，歲入不敷，爲欲保隙租界行政之安全，理當增捐。但當局宜以取之於民而不傷，用之於民而皆當爲準則。必須不失公允，勿使平民擔負特重爲限度。尤其是在此時此地，般平民，生活日見艱難，尤應極力避免其負擔。而平民之無力再納新捐，今已爲有目共覩之。吾人須知居民之所以有納捐之能力者，純因其有相常之人項。今上海之平民，進款則日見削减，而消費日益在增加。故當局對於般薪給職工，及正當啊商業，不能不顧及負擔輕重之能力稅。若能以此爲準備，則最後之負擔，終極之負擔，不會加在一般憔悴呻吟，於生活不堪負荷，或難能維持之平民大衆，或正當商工業身上。而銀號業係投機之事業，且對木市居民有害。而又是一種獲暴利者。在任何方面言，理當加重捐稅。如此本市居民又能享受完備之社會公用服務。</p>
<h3 id="c96">徵收銀號捐之優點 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>一、公允　居民納捐，以供當局之用。必常就各人可能範圍以內之力量爲比例。易言之，即納捐須按照各人之能力徵收。能力大者負擔較多，能力小者，負擔較少，今薪給勤勞者，或正式商工業，每月所獲得之薪工或利潤，尚不能過共生活及維持營業，而銀號爲偶然所得，或可稱之謂不勞而獲，當局以平等微捐，如欠公允。故高捐銀號稅及成交稅，在任何一方言，如較公允。</p>
<p>二、富彈性　銀號為戰後之一種新興企業，亦可稱之謂戰後之一種特殊投機事業。工部局在承平之時，一切均能循序進行。財務預算，無甚重大變動。今啊部局在此非常時期，行動之範圍擴張；又因貨幣諸關係？經費需要大量膨脹。銀號已為戰時之特種事業，故恰能適合其切迫之需要，且又具哦彈性之一種捐稅</p>
<p>三、收人充裕　戰時之銀號，設立者有六七百家之多。僅棉紗一項言，平均每家每日成交數在二百包以上。若以每包佣金一元計算，則一日可得十餘萬元。工部局若捐其四分之一，則每日可得三萬元。一月以二十二日計算，（假日不在內）則可得六七十萬元。其他烚赤，公債，美票，等尚不計在內。如此捐能開徵，則預計新預算年度中，可獲得捐款的八九百萬元，而事實上，尚不僅此數。</p>
<h3 id="c97">結論 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>戰時之銀號，實爲投機者之工具。而銀號係利用人之投機獲利心理，不顧一切，唯暴利是求的一種抽頭事業。其影響所及在使平民負担加重，及工商業之難能振興。但吾人欲就目前情勢而言解決物價問題，减輕平民負担，確乎有其不可能。然雖不能全部解決，有部份之解決辦法亦爲吾人所期望。就大體言：取償於當局之力助，至少有部份之成效者。在目下當局如能高微銀號捐，在當局可得合理之經費，以裨公家支出之膨脹。同時間接又可：一，抑平物價。二，减少投機。三，移轉購買力，四對新設銀號，作寓禁於捐。</p>
<p>或謂高捐銀號，與國府之所得稅，及非常時期利得稅相抵觸。但不知今日之銀號組織，已屬不法，其更願繳納此稅耶？</p>
<p>或謂銀號係一種冒險較大之企業，所以利得亦應該與其成比例。但知其內幕者，則知毫無冒險可言。而是坐享其利之收受佣金機關。故高收銀號捐，在目前確是一舉二得之辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c98">德國「收買」法產的策略 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 周樹華譯</p>
<p>法國大部份的實業完全被德國所佔領，這無疑地是在歷史上最有組織的大規模的奪取。但除了牠數量的鉅大之外，最足驚人者是牠業不同於以往鄱種戰利品的攫奪；因爲一切佔領物，德國都是「合法地」付過　郞的代價。</p>
<p>在休戰協定中，法國答允賠償德國每天四萬萬法郞；照法定官價折算，這巨款約合一千萬美金弱。牠是維持法淪陷區內的德國軍隊。</p>
<p>但是德軍在法國佔領區內的維持費每天不過一萬一千五百萬法郞。因此德國當局除了付去佔領區軍隊的一切費用之外尚餘一萬七千五白萬法郞。牠最大的用途之一就是用來購買法國的實業。在這决大恥終止的時候，德國希望有合法的名義全部統制法國的重工業，印刷業，及無綫電。</p>
<p>在法國境外，全歐所有的法國實業全部被德國收買去。捷克的蘇哥達大兵工廠（Skoda）和全歐出產最富的大銅鑛，即南斯拉夫的竇寳銅鎊(De　Bor)也句括在內。竇寳銅鑛的轉讓是拉伐爾在去冬十二月未被逐之前和里本屈甫及亞培茲在巴黎談妥的。當貝當上將聽到這消息時，據說他曾經這樣地說過「拉伐爾是一塊一塊地在出賣法國」。</p>
<p>法國的重工業（大部份是在南部的）和出版事業也被大量地收買。在法淪陷區內，大多數的報紙是被德人局部地或全部地統治着。</p>
<p>德人極力地在收買哈瓦斯社，因此這法國的新聞社和全國獨占的廣告社就不得不重新組織以免完全淪在德人的掌握中。在這改組之後，哈瓦斯將這富有的獨占廣告社的全權轉讓給德國，但是保持了新聞社的實權。</p>
<p>黑却脫（Hachette's)，這最大的印刷和脅行托辣斯，拒絕了德方的收買。德人是特別地渴想管轄這公司，因爲希望由此可以管理學校敎科書的出版事宜。</p>
<p>因爲黑却睨拒絕德方收買，就被巴黎「晚報」及其他在巴黎之德人統轄下的物紙大大地攻擊。他們將黑却脫攻擊得無微不至而言辭的卑劣簡直不堪設想，這些攻擊是繼續不斷的。</p>
<p>這公司看起來必然得讓步，雖則牠有着很大的資源。牠絕無保障而假若報紙的攻擊不能就奏效的話，他們就會實行「調查」及其他各種的手段來使那公司不得不屈服。</p>
<p>可能的話，德人總是用較和緩的手段來解決一切問題。有時，他們願出較市價更高的代價；有時，廠主不願售與德人，德人就雇了些法人傀儡去購買。當這些方法都不奏效的時候，他們就會放出和緩的暗示來：「你現在能賣還是趁早出賣，否則你的產業或許會被沒收的</p>
<p>最近巴黎「文匯報」（Paris'Oeuvre）登載着下列這樣的一段告示:</p>
<p>「法商　寳銅鑛公司董事會茲請各臺東注意即現有德人團體擬購買本公司之股票並將管理本公司一切業務，此事前經財務部長於一九四〇年十二月九日明令宣示。不論何種股票…每股作價三千五百法郞。股票的出售是隨意的…但是本董事會切實勸告各位股東從速辦理雖則並沒有强硬的意思，但是沒有人會不明瞭牠的含意的。</p>
<p>最近維希政府製定法律禁止法國國內外的法人將產業轉售給他國人民。假若這法律能實行的話，牠就會和緩法國實業彼攫取的趨勢。但是牠並不能阻止私有實業的出售，因爲這類的股票並不在市塲上登記的。很多法國重工業就這樣地被德人獲得的。在這法令　過的那星期內。就有一家私有的在洛萊（Iorraine）的紗廠以三千萬法郞售出了。</p>

<h3 id="c99">縣鄉金融改建問題　續第三七四期 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 李氷一</p>
<p>其决，縣鄉銀行的業務範圍經規定（一）轉抵押轉貼現或保證信用放款。（二）滙兌聯繫。（三）牧受存款。（四）代理收解。（五）代理經募公債或公司債。（六）保管貴重物品或有價證券。（七）儲蓄業務。此外並得發行農工債券，惟總額不得超過實收資本之五倍，並須呈請核准行之，可謂已經相當愼重。</p>
<p>從上面規定的業務範圍，我們可以看到中樞的縣鄉銀行對於各縣各鄉辦理轉抵押轉貼現後，可使地方不致因資金週轉的限制而對貸放縮手。農工債券的發行固足以使長期信用票據化，增加一般人對地方生產事業發生投資的信用，不過在推行之初，似應再由政府予以保息的獎助，以利發行。至於縣際的聯絡，除出滙兌聯繫及代理收解外，如有範圍　大的地方特產生產事業，似應由中樞組織直接輔導辦理聯合貸放，比較－就要活潑有力得多了。</p>
<p>再就縣鄉貸放業務一般的原則說，不但應該力求地域的普遍，並須注意就地農工商業發展實况，分別決定貸放比率的標準，蓋地方生產事業中，農業固然重要，然而却也不能忽視農產品或地方其他特產加工製造的小工業，家庭手工業以及地方販運流通的商業部門，在現在交換經濟時代，農工商各爲生產部門重要的一環，無可偏廢，應力求普遍的牛均發展，庶不致有貨積於鄉，商困於市以及由分配機構停滯而引起的各種惡劣的現象。另外，貸放的對象必須正確，務使貸出一分資金，都能確實用於生產者的生產過程中去，而不致被人利用轉爲剝削金利的工具。至於貸款數　之多寡，期間之久暫，尤當視貸款用途實際所需爲標準，吾則過多的時候，旣易浪費資金的運用，若是期間過促貸款過少，則恐怕縱有貸款之名，終亦沒有多少實益。</p>
<p>銀行業務受信與授信並重，而目構成大部分銀行資金的，本來不是銀行的資本金或公積金，而是外來的存款。所以縣鄉金融的發展，首須鼓勵儲蓄，儘量吸收零星存款，務將地方死藏資金能够起而利用，轉化私家資金爲銀行存款以用於生產事業。</p>
<p>關於經營的管理方面，原是千頭萬結，不過我個人以為有兩點非常重要。第一，應逐漸養成一般人民劉於新式金融機關利用的習慣，手續務須簡便，時間尤宜節省，從業人員應負隨時指導的責仟。第二，對於地方產業應於貸款外，對於產業技術生產過程效有指導，建議及監督的義務。俾使生產技術得有日漸改進的機會，惟從業人員應有特殊的技術訓練，當茲創設之初，要求經營成效的卓越，則百年樹人之計是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>總之，縣鄉金融改建問題，非僅爲增進戰時物資之必要的措置，抑爲我國民經濟建設之根本。縣鄉銀行所負使命之重大，仟務之艱巨，固是無可否認，而縣鄉金融改建之完成，還須縣鄉人士共同的協力，也是必然的了。（完）</p>

<p>— 王一之</p>
<p>染織之於衣，庖餐之於食，袪署　驅蠅之於住，檢偵機件之於行，…</p>
<p>西方各國科學界對於顏色應用之最新發明頤多妙緒，直接施諸廠房塲館，問接有裨衣食住行，茲特博綜衆長，　要條舉如下。</p>
<p>（一）顏色有冷煖之分：房屋內部之裝璜糊裱，如槪用紅色，則居之者覺甚熱，苟不用紅而舉室舖陳皆藍色，則感甚凉。凡此冷熱之見，每隨色彩而殊，人類如是，飛蠅亦如是。（蚊子則喜接近深晤之色。）蠅性畏寒，是以庖廚烹調之室，內砌藍磚者，飛蠅不欲久停而旋即引去。</p>
<p>（二）色彩影響啊作之効能：人力過强之機器房，設或四壁刷藍色，工役居其內便感微凉。打鐵匠在藍色光下工作，成績特好。</p>
<p>（三）光亮致潔凈之新生活：住房之新式者，結構淸簡而舉室通明，配以淺黃或淡綠不加雕飾之几椅，偶著織塵，即被察及，極易養成好淸潔之風習。</p>
<p>（四）中正光燈之鑑定色彩：在燈光下，不易求得正確之色彩，然日光下各人所見之色彩，亦非完全芷確，捷克百衲城物理學名師綺縵Tschermak博士最近，發明。中正光燈Neutrel-Lichtlampe」乃使鑒別顏色之光通過甚多之光濾，，以之辨色，不差毫末，其賴以審定之色，尚視白晝之天光爲更正確。此燈之於染織印刷等工塲，用度極廣。</p>
<p>（五）張藍帘以挑選黃色之珠：人目對於各種色視之既久，莫不疲倦，人造珠廠之工友終日接近猩紅火紅）與珊瑚紅（紅之近黃者）兩色之珠，每因目力之疲而辨視不良，發生不少錯誤亟宜使室內，略沾絲色光俾此兩般紅色之差別，加顯加强，以减目力衰敝之苦。若爲終日挑選黃色之工作室，則應即在壁間高張藍帘，俾因藍色光之返射，使各人覺大氣之中帶藍光。</p>
<p>（六）燈光加罩者返射之功：夜問用有色之燈光，辨視五彩圖畫威物品，亦可使相似兩色之差別，由弱變强，因以輕减目力之疲耗。</p>
<p>（七）暗陬利於回復正確之視覺：如有人得暇晷，靜止於暗室，張其雙目，使經黑暗之淘洗，（此謂浴於暗，正於裸身暴於日光之下『日浴』相反背）而後出至日光下，則暫時目力淸鮮，用以辨色，必甚正確。</p>
<p>（八）餅店餐館有『不兩全』之美：食物由生變熟時，烹調者每有一種習慣，可用顏色之變換，默測透熟與吾之火候綫深。但如此室燈過亮，驟令微焦與未焦之色彩差別，由弱變强，或竟以未焦之色，誤認爲微焦，往往食物剛半熟，火候未足而急忙取去。此爲餅房餐館偶遇之糾紛，與人造珠廠色彩差別過弱之病正相反，而失出之與失入，則固同爲錯誤。近人勉得一法，欲施補救，謂惟有將爐旁牆壁，預先刷成火候程度恰到好處之焦黃云。</p>
<p>（九）辨色可以檢偵機器內部之弱點：機器內部機件，每因轉動之速或壓力之過强，致其動作中熱度高低，不能更用『寒暑表』詳加測度。新法刷上一種易於因高熱度變換顏色之漆，乘其熱力高漲中而略一窺視，即使察知機器以內各部分：何者最熱何者爲太熱，因以檢偵全部機器中之弱點在何處，此亦前人意想不到者精奇之造詣也。</p>
<h3 id="c106">兩種盛紡新出品 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>今年夏季婦女衣料，盛行着一種毛蔴交織的顏色橫條派力司，驟視之，這種衣料柔軟伏貼，好像很文雅，但細一審視，其粗鬆之處，實亦不亞於蔴袋布，不過這種衣料。是有着一個「來路貨」的美名，與夫每件旗袍非七八十塊錢高貴的價値而巳。</p>
<p>其實，今年國產絲綢的盛紡，也有兩種夏季衣料的新出品，一種是類乎上述派力司的顏色橫條生紡，那是女衣料，經緯都用天然絲，經絲純白，緯絲彩色織成，闊度一尺五寸，恰巧配合旗袍之用，因爲楚生紡，所以質地比較生硬些，但透明輕鬆，較諸普通的生絲或是紗羅，實無多讓。每件旗袍料價値祇需七八元，其底廉在國產絲綢中，可以說是無可與匹。就是其堅韌力比較脆弱些，但普通婦女們對於夏季旗袍，祗是在出行時一套就算，那是十分適用而合乎經濟之道的。而况又是一年一度的呢？</p>
<p>另一種出品是電力織造的完全廠絲電力紡，闊度二尺二寸，經緯都是用上等廠絲織成，因此綢面光潔平凈，身地也比較滯重，每尺熟分在七八錢以上，極適合裁製男子長衫或襯衫之用，此種廠絲紡的優點，在於經洗耐穿，色澤愈洗愈明凈，身地愈洗愈緊密，較諸早前的光扣紡和舶來品的印度綢璧縐等等，實不可同日而語。而且價格也極便宜，綢緞店家發賣每尺得四元左右，但直接向盛綢莊選購，每疋四丈六尺，不過一百二三十元，每尺也祗合二元七八角，以視其他各種絲綢，還是比較低廉的。</p>

<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>本刋關於醬油與胃病之討論文字，已刊載多篇，筆者自慚無此經騐，不敢有所談論，今茲所述，迺醬油防霉及其利用數點，略誌於决，以貢獻於讀者。</p>
<p>醬油雖爲烹調之要品，而其用量之多寡，當視所烹菜餚而定，大率紅燒魚肉等，固應多用若干，然淸燉及醃臘同燒之餚饌，則不宜加入醬油，他如香椿拌豆腐等，亦以不加醬油爲宜。惟近來天氣已入霉期，醬油每易發霉，（即出白花）欲免此弊，可將醬油入釜前沸，待凉後，傾入瓶中，將瓶塞塞緊，惟該瓶須先揩拭乾凈，不可留有水點，則久藏亦不發霉矣。</p>
<p>醬油除調味外，可解酒醉及止痛之功效，凡患醉酒者，泡濃醬油湯飮之，即解，又皮膚爲沸水或火灼傷時，而未破裂者，即用醬油敷患處，即可止痛，惟面部如患瘡毒新愈，不可以生醬汕蘸食物，否則即現黑斑，而損美觀，此均食用醬油之小常識也。</p>

<p>上市不久的豆類，又有兩種，一是毛豆，一是茳豆，毛豆每兩的四五分，茳豆每兩的三四分，這價格當然不算便宜；然而近來無論葷菜素菜，試問那一樣是便宜的呢？豆類最富維他命，每天吃一些自很有益；毛豆可作各種葷素菜的輔佐品，此外葷的做法，可與猪肉或牛肉一同紅燜；素的做法，可以帶殼拖了麵漿紅燒，都是下飯的妙品。茳豆葷的做法，可與肉絲或肉片同炒，素的做法，那麼只須加些油條乾絲之類，一同淸炒好了。</p>

<p>— 淸</p>
<p>圖書是人類智識的紀綠，舊的史跡，新的發明，都要從圖書中去尋找系統的記述。但圖書本身，實在不僅是智識的主要食糧，並且也是調劑精神的一種消遣；閒來一卷在手，不是可以得到無窮樂趣嗎？</p>
<p>因此，我深深地感到每個家庭一定要置備幾木相常的圖書，預備全家人在閒暇時藉以消遣，而無形中增進學問與智識。在我們日常的進益裏，應該化費一些在圖書上－一份日報，幾種雜誌和畫報。除此以外，如字典，日用百科全書，醫藥衛生，烹調，縫紉…之類的參考書，也是不能缺少。至於有孩子的家庭，更須添置幾種兒童圖書，以養成兒童閱讀圖書的習慣。</p>
<p>每决購買圖書不必買得太多，應該估計閒暇時間的多寡，而定購買的數量。否則書多閒暇少，閱讀不完，常常會發生厭倦或甚至放棄它們。但是書少閒暇多，那麼不正當的娛樂，便會乘這空隙而引誘我們了。這一點自然要經過一番閱讀能力的試騐，方能在書肆中買得適量的圖書。</p>
<p>關於圖書的安置，也是一個重耍問題，如果陳列得當，當然是有助於屋內裝飾的，吾則零星散亂，東一本，西一本，便有礙觀瞻而違反了「整潔」的條件。現在我們安置圖書的地方，不一定要有書架和書橱，只要安置在適當而便於取置的地方便得了。</p>

<p>— 亦名</p>
<p>行路；是一件最平常的事，所以一般人對於行路也向來是不注意的，無論是衛生，安全，道德等等，尤其是不注意於行路的道德。</p>
<p>我們往往看見有些人在走路的時候，橫衝直撞，簡直像賽跑一樣，絕不曾顧慮到老弱與婦女的安全，因此，被撞倒和被踏痛的事也時常可以發生，還有些人却相反的，在路上東張西望，踱着方步，甚至于挽手的連成一排，（尤其是女性）使人家無論有何要事，只好耐心兒去讓他們。再有在雨天的時候，張有雨具的人偏要靠着牆根走，而光着身子的人，反而被擠得在馬路上儘淋，叉當一個取了重物的人在前面或後面走來的時候，（事實上取重物的也頂多的是苦力和學徒們，理應同情他們的）空着手的，（也最多的是智識份子）非但不會去體恤和避讓，而且還裝着一本正經的面孔，盛氣的呵斥着别人撞了他。</p>
<p>諸如此類的矛盾事實，告訴我們一般人的對道德觀念，委實太輕視了。換句話說，就是一般人還不會了解道的意義，是需要着隨時隨地的運用，任何行動上都可以表現出來，所以在行路的時候，除了需要注意行的與安全外，也有注重道德的必要。</p>

<p>— 楊彥</p>
<p>鍾進士在雲端前進。</p>
<p>突然，他按住了雲頭，聳着鼻子向空氣中深深地嗅了一下，咦！這樣濃厚的鬼氣。他有點感到奇怪，但又有點高興。摸了摸肚子，腦子裹想像着一頓豐盛的晨餐，於是他一催雲頭，直循着鬼氣味趕去。</p>
<p>「上仙慢走！」一個聲音止住了他。他回過頭來看見一個穿着古怪衣服的人。「你是誰！」鍾馗奇怪的問。「小神是本處的土地。」穿着古怪衣服的人必恭必敬的回答。</p>
<p>「哦！但是你穿的衣服？…」鍾馗搔了搔蓬亂的頭髮，遲疑地問。</p>
<p>「這是西裝，因爲這裹是租界，所以小神不得不穿西裝。」土地又恭敬地解釋着。</p>
<p>「哦！」鍾馗漫應了一聲，心中只想着那許多鬼，所以立刻把話移到這題目上：「這裏怎麼有許多鬼？」他問。</p>
<p>「這…這…」土地一時回答不出來。</p>
<p>「都是些什麼鬼？」</p>
<p>「鬼的種類多得很，有色鬼，有白麪鬼，有賭鬼，還有囤積鬼…」</p>
<p>「什麽！囤積鬼？」鍾馗雖然捉了許多的鬼，對於這名字倒是破題兒第一遭聽見。</p>
<p>「是的，這是一種新出的鬼，這種鬼專門把人類日常要用的東西藏起來，讓人們餓死。凍死。」</p>
<p>「哼！有這種可惡的鬼。」鍾馗憤怒地捋了捋頷下虬髯，兩隻大眼睛裏放射出可怕的光煇來　「好！讓我去把他們剿個乾凈！」</p>
<p>「且慢，上仙！您一個人去一定要吃虧的。」西裝土地驚惶地喊。</p>
<p>鍾馗父按住了雲頭：「笑話，你不知道我是專門啖鬼的鍾馗嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，上仙，我知道。但鬼確實多得很，他們互相有聯絡，善作「鬼打牆，」有時也不大怕城隍，他們又有錢，又有勢力。而且他們早就料到上仙要來，已經準備好應付的計劃了。」</p>
<p>「哦！」鍾馗也稍爲感到一點棘手了：「那末怎麼辦呢？」</p>

<p>「爸爸，我不要再做新衣服了！你自已爲什麽不穿呢？」好幾决梅寳都是這樣說，甚至還跟他父親哭過，吵過。</p>
<p>「孩子，我是偭莊稼人，用不到講究的。」秋海棠却總是這樣安慰她。「不比你，你是個女學生，穿得太破了，人家會笑你的。」</p>
<p>「不，讓他們笑吧！自己的爸爸穿得這樣破爛，人家不會笑嗎？」梅寳儘管還是一個十二歲的孩子，但說話已經很伶俐了。「前兩天顧先生就問我：「吳梅影，那個天天來接你回去的，可是你家里雇的活計嗎？』爸爸，你想我覺得好意思嗎？」</p>
<p>可是無論梅寳怎樣的勸說，秋海棠還是不捨得爲自己化一個錢，因爲他根本已經祇有很少的一些錢了；他要把這一些有限的錢，全部用來培植他的愛女。</p>
<p>他向小狗子笑了一笑，便毫不畏縮的撑起那柄雨傘，忽忽地在大雨裏沿着那石板路走向鎭東去。</p>
<p>下春雨在北方本來已是一件很希逢的事，而今天的雨，偏又下得特別的大；同時風勢也非常的猛，挾着一條條麵條子似的雨絲，從東北方直捲過來，儘管秋海棠手裹有一柄雨傘在撑着，身上也還不免給雨水打濕了好幾處。</p>
<p>從吳大打北平回李家莊的第二個月起，秋海棠便帶着梅寳和張小狗子搬到樟樹屯來了；因爲這裏是張小狗子的故鄉，所以他們也就很容易的在這裏買到兩間小屋，和四五畝的薄田住下了。</p>
<p>他不但遣走了王四一家，而且還把原在李家莊上所有的田地房屋，也一起賣掉了。他告訴吳老爺子說要上濟南去找一個朋友，大家合夥兒做一些生意。</p>
<p>「那也待！常言說得好，坐吃山空，你還是到外面去混混吧！」吳老爺子也並不反對，實際上秋海棠的房屋就是他賣去的；而且他很淸楚地知道秋海棠在北平存的銀子已一起倒掉了，手頭留着的委實很有限，跟他再行同居下去，不見得會有多少好處，倒不如大家早些分手的好。（一四五）</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Fierce battles are currently taking place in the Minsk and Rusk regions of the central Soviet-German front. Both sides are employing large numbers of armored units and infantry in the fighting. The German offensive is divided into two major thrusts, one aimed at Minsk and Rusk, and the other towards Minsk and Baranovichy. The Soviet army has announced that it has stopped the advance of German forces attacking Rusk and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Intense fighting is still ongoing in the Baranovichy area. The Soviet communiqué stated that the leading elements of German tanks attacking Minsk and Rusk have been stopped by Soviet forces and have suffered considerable losses. Fierce fighting is underway in the Minsk and Baranovichy areas. German infantry are attempting to link up with their leading tank units. However, due to the valiant resistance and counter-attacks of the Soviet army, the German advance has been contained and heavy casualties have been inflicted. Large-scale tank warfare is continuing in the Rusk area. The Soviet Air Force has inflicted significant damage on German tanks. The results of the battle are currently under review. The communiqué also mentioned the situation on the northern front, stating that German forces have repeatedly conducted land reconnaissance along the entire Soviet-Finnish border, supported by artillery fire. However, all attempts to penetrate Soviet territory have failed. Other Soviet troops on the front are now firmly defending the border.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. The largest war between the Soviet Union and Germany, which has lasted for a week, is currently taking place in the Minsk area. It is reported that Soviet and German armored units have engaged in fierce fighting in the area. News from Berlin indicates that German tank formations near Minsk have broken through the Soviet lines. It is also reported that a major battle is about to erupt in the Bilykavichuk area, 150 miles west of Minsk. Yesterday, the German radio station stated that the German army is conducting both offensive and defensive operations. Fierce fighting has broken out in Leck (85 miles northeast of Lviv and 250 miles southwest of Minsk).</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 29th. The Soviet Information Bureau released the following latest war report tonight: (1) On the 28th, when our troops withdrew to new positions, the covering forces fought extremely fiercely, inflicting significant defeats on the enemy. In the Shalay area, our troops captured many enemies, most of whom were intoxicated. (2) In the Minsk area, Red Army units continued to successfully fight against enemy tank units, preventing their eastward advance. According to preliminary investigations, 300 enemy tanks of the 39th Tank Regiment were destroyed in that area on the 27th. (3) A large tank battle is underway in the Rusk area, involving more than 4,000 tanks. This type of warfare is still in progress. (4) Fierce fighting is underway in the Lviv area, and our troops inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. (5) Our air force conducted extremely successful air battles and also assisted the army in launching fierce attacks. When our air force bombed the Turcha area, it destroyed two enemy armored ships on the Danube River. (6) In other areas, our troops are firmly holding their positions.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 29th. The Soviet Information Bureau has just released the following latest war report: "Throughout the night of the 28th, our troops continued to fight valiantly. The fighting in the Minsk and Rusk areas was particularly intense. In the Minsk area, our tank units, air force, and artillery used lightning strikes to defeat enemy tank units. The headquarters of the enemy's 39th Tank Regiment was also destroyed. In this battle, our army captured a large number of spoils of war and war documents, and also captured a large number of German officers and soldiers. In the Rusk and Lviv areas, our troops fought against enemy tank units throughout the night. The enemy attempted to flank Lviv, but were repulsed by our troops. Lviv is now in our hands. The results of this battle are under investigation. On the Bessarabian front, our cavalry annihilated the enemy's 6th Infantry Regiment (which was attempting to cross the Prut River). As a result of the fighting along the Danube River, our side captured more than 300 enemy soldiers again. From Bilimiis to the Black Sea, the enemy repeatedly attempted to break through our lines, but were repelled. Our troops are now firmly defending the positions on this line. On the 27th, our air force bombed enemy motorcycle and mechanized units in the Shalay, Vilnius, Minsk, and Rusk areas, inflicting significant losses on enemy tanks."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th. The German authorities responsible stated in a supplementary war report yesterday that the German authorities are still maintaining silence on the situation on the Eastern Front in order to prevent the Soviet authorities from learning about the unfavorable position of the Soviet troops on the front. The Soviet Information Bureau yesterday released news of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the north, which is sufficient to confirm the advantages occupied by the German army. Since Hungary joined the anti-Soviet war, the anti-Bolshevik front in the east has now been unified. The Soviet troops in the Carpathian Mountains region of Hungary have also been pushed back as a result. Currently, the flanks of the Soviet troops have been threatened. It is reported that fighting has broken out in the Lviv area. The German Air Force has an absolute advantage on the Eastern Front, bombing the enemy's air force and army every day. German nighttime air defenses are extremely tight, and a total of 17 enemy aircraft were shot down by German anti-aircraft guns in one night.</p>
<h3 id="e2">German Troops Advance North Through Finland, Attempting to Attack Murmansk <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. According to news from the Swedish capital yesterday, German troops have launched an attack on Soviet territory in the Arctic. The Swedish newspaper Berlin reported that Nazi forces departing from Norway are currently advancing through northern Finland towards the Kola Peninsula in the northernmost part of the Soviet Union. Their primary target appears to be the Soviet port of Murmansk. In a decisive battle, the Soviet Union has been transporting supplies from the United States through this port. According to reports from Berlin, the German troops advancing east along the only road in the frozen wilderness of northern Finland are Alpine troops and bridge-building engineers. At the same time, German bomber squadrons have taken off to attack Soviet underground aircraft hangars on the Kola Peninsula. Finnish artillery units have begun shelling Soviet defenses around Hanko Port. This port is located at the southern tip of Finland and was leased to the Soviet Union after the Soviet-Finnish War last year. Soviet aircraft based in Hanko are extremely active, bombing the surrounding countryside, especially near Aikanaas Port. Travelers arriving in the Swedish capital said that on Wednesday and Thursday, Soviet aircraft flew over the Aland Islands, but did not drop bombs. These islands were demilitarized last year at the request of Moscow by Finland. However, reports from Berlin stated that Finland has now sent troops to the Aland Islands. According to reports from the Finnish capital in the Swedish capital's newspaper, the eight Soviet consuls and thirty staff members stationed on the Aland Islands have arrived in the Finnish capital. The Soviet Minister to Finland and a portion of the staff were still in the Finnish capital on Friday night. However, some staff members had already left several days ago. The Soviet Legation is now guarded by soldiers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th. Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim issued a military order from his headquarters this morning. According to a dispatch from the Finnish capital received by the German official news agency, the military order stated that the results of our army's campaign last winter were a painful peace. However, our country continues to face threats. This peace is only a truce and has now been declared canceled. Finally, he appealed to the entire nation to unite against the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mines Laid in Swedish Waters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 29th. The Swedish Minister of the Navy announced yesterday that, in order to safeguard Swedish neutrality, mines have been laid in the waters southeast of Åland. Ships sailing in that area should pay attention to the navigational regulations for that area.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 29th. Newspapers in Helsinki stated that Sweden's preparations to facilitate the passage of German troops to suppress Communism show that Sweden has expressed its pragmatic policy. The development of the same spirit can be seen from now on. According to the Swedish foreign ministry spokesman's announcement of the concession allowing German troops to pass through, it was solemnly declared that this was a special temporary measure and would not be repeated.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 29th. British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Ambassador Winant held a long conversation on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th. British Ambassador to the United States Halifax visited the State Department twice yesterday. The ambassador and Undersecretary of State Welles discussed the situation in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 29th. British Ambassador Cripps was formally received by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov after arriving in Moscow yesterday with the British military mission. Shortly afterwards, the British Ambassador met with the Soviet Foreign Minister again. British delegation members are now in contact with various Soviet ministers in order to provide the Soviet Union with the most rapid assistance possible.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 29th. Most of the British newspapers and public opinion advocate that the British army and navy should immediately launch a joint attack on the coasts of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway in order to disperse the German forces attacking the Eastern battlefield, to strike at the Nazi preparations for the invasion of Britain, and to give the people in the occupied areas excitement. Some people in Britain often dream of a full-scale offensive landing on the European continent by a large expeditionary force, first gaining a foothold. However, sober military strategists believe that this matter is too large, and the British army is still in the equipping stage, and should not be held until its strength is sufficient to crush German resistance.</p>

According to yesterday's news: Mr. Owen Lattimore, a well-known American scholar of Eastern problems, has been recommended by the American President and appointed as a political advisor to the highest military and political authorities in China; at the same time, Mr. Quo Tai-chi, the new Chinese Foreign Minister who is known internationally for advocating the ABC policy, has also arrived in Chongqing via the Burma Road after returning from London via the United States, and is about to take office as Foreign Minister. China's international environment in the four years of war has been the best recently, and the diplomatic strategy is suitable for this time to be refreshed according to actual needs. The US authorities have recommended to China the scholar who can most deeply understand China, so as to achieve the effect of assistance. This not only symbolizes the increasingly close cooperation between China and the United States and various democratic countries, but also can be imagined that it will be able to promote the completion of the great cause of anti-aggression in the Far East.</p>
<p>China's mobilization of resistance has now lasted for four years. During this extraordinary period, from administration to military affairs, from construction to economy, everything is changing with each passing day. However, the most obvious and visible effect to the world is diplomacy. Recalling the beginning of the war, the sympathy of people from all countries for China was not necessarily less than today, and the international political situation was becoming increasingly bleak. Even in democratic countries, there were often concerns about harming their own interests. Therefore, the international assistance that China received at that time was only partial measures from one or two friendly countries, and the amount was very small. It was not only unable to constitute a part of the important national policy of democratic countries. However, as time changes and the world is in turmoil, those who were unable to effectively support China in stopping aggression have now gradually decided to personally suffer the impact of the war. Therefore, they have truly realized the inseparable connection between China's war and the stability of the world order. In the minds of the most enlightened politicians in democratic countries, the task of aiding China is regarded as being on par with resisting Nazi aggression, and is gradually moving towards active implementation. This profound friendship is very precious. This is indeed due to the objective situation, and it is not just a fluke for China. Compare it with Japan in the past four years: As early as May 1938, when the first Konoe Cabinet was reorganized and General Ugaki was appointed as Foreign Minister, the responsibility for "resolving the incident" and opening up the isolated situation was entrusted to diplomacy. Although the cabinet has been reorganized several times since then, the position of Foreign Minister has been the life of the cabinet, and they all have high hopes for diplomacy. However, even with the high hopes of Ugaki and Nomura, and the talent of Arita and Matsuoka, the policies have been changed repeatedly and many attempts have been made. As a result, not only has nothing been achieved, but the more they struggle, the more difficult it becomes. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the friendship and estrangement between friends and enemies in the international community has been completely clarified. Japan alone is still lingering in between, unable to make a decision, as pointed out in yesterday's editorial of this newspaper. The distinction between more help and less help is clear. In terms of the success or failure of diplomacy, it is enough to imply the trend of the future for both China and Japan.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that diplomacy can determine everything, nor does it mean that China's diplomatic achievements can be complacent. The success or failure of war depends on the comparison of the sum of national power, and diplomacy is only its obvious indicator. In history, there are indeed precedents for using external operations to save the country's dangerous situation, such as the lobbyists in the Six Kingdoms, and Talleyrand and Cavour in France and Italy, but they are by no means the general norm. The international status of a country is proportional to its comprehensive achievements in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, and it must also depend on whether its national policy is in line with justice and fairness. Apart from this, if you only expect a miracle in diplomacy, even a powerful country like Japan will end up as described above, let alone others. Furthermore, examining the current international situation in the Far East, the Sino-US-British-Soviet joint resistance to aggression that the world has always yearned for has now gradually emerged with the Soviet-German war, which is truly gratifying. However, in reality, this future only has its possibility in objective terms. Between Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union, their positions and interests in the two major anti-aggression wars in Europe and Asia are roughly the same. However, due to the incomplete maturity of the actual opportunities, not only is there little parallel and unified planning between them, but their measures also have their own different mechanisms. For example, the advocates of the US emphasis on Europe and light on Asia have recently suffered a major setback, while the Soviet Union has not regarded the Far East as being on par with its resistance to the Nazis, so that those who have entrusted their eastern border security to the neutrality agreement and the resolution of commercial border disputes may soon see a repeat of the 1919 Eastern Siberian incident. It goes without saying that two-front warfare is deeply dreaded by any country, and the joint forces of China, the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union are more than enough to suppress aggression throughout the world. The current major regret is that the planning of this alliance is still lacking in the Far East. Britain and the Soviet Union are now focusing all their efforts on the great war on the European continent. Therefore, how to promote the realization of this united anti-aggression front, so as to achieve the effect of reversing the chaos and restoring order in the Far East as soon as possible, the responsibility of China and the United States is very heavy, and it is especially the heavy responsibility of Foreign Minister Guo and Mr. Lattimore after they come to China. Dare to use this idea to question the Chinese and American governments and people.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Soviet Paratroopers Land in Romania, Fighting Breaks Out on the Hungarian Border <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Bucharest, 29th. The German and Romanian High Commands issued a communiqué last night stating that German and Romanian troops continued to break through Red Army units on the front from Bukovina to the Black Sea and repelled several Soviet counterattacks. It also stated, "German and Romanian troops have completed their missions, and the enemy's attempts to counterattack have been frustrated. Soviet paratroopers landed in several strongholds, but most were captured." "Soviet aircraft bombed the areas of Iasi, Busal, Galati, and Constanta." It also stated that 103 enemy aircraft have been destroyed in recent days, while our army has lost only three. The communiqué also stated that two Soviet destroyers appeared outside the port of Constanta in the Black Sea on June 26. "The Moskva was sunk, and another one may have been injured."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 29th. The Soviet torpedo cruiser "Moskva" in the Black Sea has been sunk. The ship has a displacement of 1,895 tons, a speed of 35 knots, five 13 cm guns, two 7.5 cm guns, three anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes. It was completed in 1937 and is the latest type of Soviet warship.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 29th. According to reports from British and Soviet radio stations, the Romanian oil center of Ploiesti was bombed, and its oil refineries caught fire. This has been confirmed here yesterday.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 29th. According to the Hungarian military department, Soviet aircraft bombed the two cities of Nagybánya and Darabfarva on the 27th, but there was not much damage. Yesterday, several small battles broke out between the Soviet and Hungarian armies on the border. Hungarian troops have crossed the border in several places to pursue the enemy army.</p>
<h3 id="e7">British Reporter Discusses German Strategy, Attempts to Launch a Large-Scale Attack on Moscow <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. The Reuters military reporter stated that the Soviet-German war has been going on for a week, and the war situation is quite intense. It is still too early to clearly understand the strategic objectives of the Nazis. However, observing the current developments, several judgments can be made. A week ago, the reporter said that the German army might launch two major attacks, one against Kyiv and one against Vilnius, and then take Smolensk and spy on Moscow. The developments of last week have shown that these two attacks have already been implemented, with a lot of troops and strong attacks. However, it is not until the results of the great war currently underway along the entire broad front are clearly visible that the second step of action in the future can be determined. Regardless of what kind of war results are obtained, and regardless of where the weakness is found, it is bound to tilt its support troops in the direction where progress has already been made, and expand its gains with all its strength. This is the strategy used by the German army. This strategy is applicable to a front that is 20 miles long or 200 miles long or, as it is now, 1,500 miles long. The weakness of the Soviet army's front is clearly in the north and not in the south, because the north has fewer obstacles and is conducive to advancing, unlike the south which has the Ganglilian Mountains of the Carpathian Mountains and the Prut River, the Southern Bug River and the Dniester River running through it, which are obstacles to direct eastward advance. The Soviet Union also seems to have thicker troops in the south than in the north. However, at this time, we cannot make a definite statement on the distribution of Soviet troops. But one thing is now clear: the German army's advance is now blocked on the line from Limburg to the south for 500 miles to the Black Sea. As for the north and northeast, the German army has made some progress. In the Minsk area, the German army has penetrated 200 miles. Germany is still promoting its fresh troops here to replenish the front-line troops. At the same time, for the south, it only wants to involve the Soviet army with the troops it has already arrived at. The purpose of the German staff at this time is probably to point directly at Moscow with heavy troops after finding the weakness, in order to break the center of the Soviet Union and divide the Soviet army into two halves. Moscow is not only the concentration point of the whole country politically, but also in terms of railway transportation and commerce. If this city is lost, it will be a great blow to the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union will definitely do its best to stop it. The German army's trend towards Minsk seems to be only a bold action of a large army fleeing forward, and did not make the Soviet army's front there mess up, because the Soviet army seems to be giving it a heavy blow with a powerful counterattack. In terms of intention, the German side seems to be using the same method to assemble so-called reserve forces and counterattack and cut off the enemy army that has broken through the front line, so as to make a more fierce advance on Moscow in order to obtain a more decisive effect. This is the right track of using new-style war equipment to make new-style warfare, because it is to maintain the gains made in flat and unimpeded places, not to guard the positions with heavy troops, but to use the support troops to use the greatest speed and give a powerful hammer blow to the flanks of the enemy army that has broken through the positions and rushed in. The Soviet army has not only fought very bravely in the past week, but also has been well-regulated, and is now gradually getting the support of its air force, but its air force's bombing behind the German front has not yet reached the point where it can produce an effect worth talking about.</p>
<h3 id="e8">German Special War Bulletin <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 19th, from the German Führer's Headquarters: The German High Command issued the following special war bulletin from the Führer's Headquarters:</p>
<p>Number One: In order to eliminate the threat from the East and West, the German army launched an attack on the enemy at 3:00 AM on the 22nd of this month. The German air force attacked the enemy at dawn. Although the number of Soviet aircraft was large, the German aircraft seized air superiority over the Eastern Front on the 22nd, severely damaging the Soviet air force. A total of 322 Soviet aircraft were shot down in air combat, and the Soviet aircraft destroyed at airfields totaled 1,811 by the evening of the 22nd. On that day, the German aircraft lost only 35 aircraft.</p>
<p>Number Two: On the morning of the 22nd of this month, the German army on the Eastern Front crossed the long German-Soviet border, breaking through the prepared Soviet troops and key Soviet border fortresses. Some were breached on the first day. The Soviet army launched fierce counterattacks, which were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German air force assisted in the battle and achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Number Three: On the 23rd of this month, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack against the German vanguard, resulting in fierce fighting. The German army won, and the Soviet army was defeated in bloody melee combat. After fierce battles, the German army occupied the Grodno fortress. The Soviet air force suffered heavy losses on that day. By the evening of the 23rd, 2,582 Soviet aircraft had been destroyed. Number Four: The Brest-Litovsk fortress, after being heavily bombarded by heavy artillery, fell into the hands of the German army on the 24th of this month. After reaching Vilnius and Kaunas, the German vanguard occupied the two cities on the same day.</p>
<p>Number Five: The Soviet army attacked the German army with a large number of tanks, attempting to stop the German advance. The German tank corps and anti-tank gun units, assisted by aircraft and anti-aircraft gun units, still controlled the battlefield. The new Soviet giant tanks were destroyed due to the bravery of German soldiers and the superiority of weapons. In the four days after the outbreak of the war, the German army destroyed 1,200 Soviet tanks. The German air force also destroyed 97 tanks, it is said.</p>
<p>Number Six: The German army in the Baltic region reached the Daugava River on the 26th of this month and crossed the river in several places. Daugavpils fell into the hands of the German army. The enemy attempted to stop the German advance but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Number Seven: German warships and submarines repeatedly attacked the Soviet navy. A Soviet destroyer was sunk by a mine in the eastern Baltic Sea. The cruiser "Gorky" was also severely damaged. German submarines destroyed three Soviet submarines. German motor torpedo boats sank two enemy destroyers, one torpedo boat, and one submarine. Two Soviet destroyers attempted to attack the port of Constanța but were repelled by the coastal artillery. One was destroyed, and the other fled in panic.</p>
<p>Number Eight: After two days of fierce fighting, the German tank corps ended the large-scale tank battle north of Kaunas on the 26th of this month, encircling and annihilating several enemy tank divisions, capturing more than 200 Soviet tanks, including 29 heavy tanks, and capturing more than 150 artillery pieces and hundreds of vehicles. Number Nine: South of the Pripyat Marshes, the German army fought fiercely with the elite of the Red Army, persevering and bravely defeating the enemy, occupying the fortress west of Kovel, and is now advancing towards Kovel. In the north, the German tank corps advanced eastward, directly approaching Lusk. The German air force made significant contributions. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and lost many tanks. In the battles around Dubno alone, the enemy lost 200 tanks and many artillery pieces, including 42 of the largest caliber.</p>
<p>Number Ten: Two large Soviet army units were surrounded by the German army east of Bialystok. Although the Soviet army repeatedly attempted to break out of the encirclement, it ultimately failed. The encircling German army became increasingly tight. Within a few days, the Soviet army will either surrender or be annihilated. In any case, the Soviet army attempting to break through the German center is at a loss and cannot escape its fate.</p>
<p>Number Eleven: Our armored forces and mechanized units have bypassed Bialystok and reached the vicinity of Minsk. Great victories are to be expected.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 29th, Berlin: From the 22nd to the 27th of this month, the German army captured 40,000 Soviet soldiers, 600 artillery pieces, and 2,233 armored vehicles, including 46 heavy tanks, each weighing 52 tons. In addition, countless anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, rifles, and motorcycles were captured. The Red Air Force lost a total of 4,107 aircraft. German aircraft lost only 150 aircraft during the same period.</p>

<p>TASS, 28th, Moscow: The Pravda editorial, headlined "Victory Must Be Achieved, Victory Must Belong to Us," stated, "The national patriotic sentiment is boiling, and everyone has an unwavering determination to destroy the Fascist bandits. The narrow-minded and arrogant German Fascists have failed to understand the strength they have aroused, but they will realize it later. The Red Army is fighting valiantly and courageously at the front. Although the war has only just begun, the era of the petty German imitators of Napoleon's worthless achievements and false victories is over. They will soon be punished for their crimes and evil deeds. Our whole country is calm and confident that we will achieve victory. Although our country has been attacked by treacherous Fascists, we will never flinch and will continue our mission. We must redouble our efforts, increase production, and provide all assistance to our Red Army and Navy. We know that victory will not come on its own but must be won through resolute and bloody battles. Our country knows the price of sacrifice. We understand the difficulties, but we will overcome them. Lenin and Stalin's instructions to all people are to overcome difficulties. The war has begun and cannot be ended in the short term. We must not be flustered or discouraged by temporary achievements and victories. This war, involving millions of people, is a difficult historical struggle, but one thing we know for sure is that victory will belong to us. We will win because the war we are engaged in is a sacred war for the motherland. Our Red Army is full of strength, we have inexhaustible support, and our people and the Stalin government are determined. We must grit our teeth, work hard, and strive for victory until the world's public enemy, German Fascism, is crushed."</p>
<p>TASS, 28th, Moscow: Finnish President Ryti, in his broadcast address, repeated Hitler's claim that "in November 1940, the Soviets asked Germany to allow the Soviet Union to settle and end matters with Finland." Regarding this matter, Pravda commented, "The purpose of this rumor is to deceive and incite the Finnish people against the Soviet Union and to cover up the crimes of the 'Ryti Company' against the Finnish people. The Finnish rulers have violated the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Finland in 1940. They have secretly allied themselves with the German Fascists and turned their country into a base for attacking the Soviet Union, allowing the German Fascists to use it. Under the guidance of German officers, Finland has rapidly fortified its borders, and the German Fascists have even openly gathered 'volunteers' in Finland. Germany and Finland have conducted joint demonstrations on the border. The Soviet Union has tolerated the provocations of the Finnish Fascist government for a long time. It is time for us to teach them a lesson. The Finnish warlords and German mercenaries must already know the painful lessons that the enemies who invaded the Soviet border and Leningrad once encountered. This lesson that we will give to Hitler's lackeys will be a hundred times greater than before. After this decisive lesson, they will never recover. The Red Army will do its utmost to guarantee the safety of Leningrad."</p>
<p>Reuters, 29th, Lisbon: A military commentator for the Lisbon newspaper Voz stated that the Soviet Union, with its strong struggle, should be able to stop the attacking army for as long as three months, at which time the allied countries should be able to come and assist. Britain now certainly has some time to rest, it is said.</p>

<p>Reuters, 29th, Washington: According to reliable sources yesterday, the U.S. authorities have decided to request that Congress formally declare the existence of a national emergency so that President Roosevelt, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, can have a free hand in national defense actions. The War Department advocates making this declaration so that those undergoing selective service training, national guardsmen, and reserve officers can be retained on active duty indefinitely. Officials believe that although the President has already declared a national emergency, without the consent of Congress, if Congress also declares a national emergency, it can remove the restrictions on the President's powers. The President would be able to send troops to locations outside the Western Hemisphere and grant the President other powers.</p>

<p>United Press, 29th, Washington: News yesterday indicated that the U.S. government's aid to China includes consideration of building new airfields and aircraft manufacturing plants in strategically defended areas within China. It is understood that more than one hundred American military pilots have resigned from their positions in the U.S. Army Air Corps in order to serve in China. The government's aid to China approves of such resignations. Haitong News Agency, 29th, Chongqing: According to information received here indirectly, many American pilots and engineers have arrived in Kunming. According to well-informed sources, they will arrive in Chongqing in the near future.</p>

<p>United Press, 29th, Washington: The Senate yesterday passed a bill extending the President's power to devalue the dollar for two years. At the same time, the Treasury Department's authority to maintain a $2,000,000,000 stabilization fund was also extended for two years. The bill was passed by a vote of 40 to 20 and was immediately sent to the White House for signing. After the passage of this bill, the Treasury Department will be able to continue its power to implement the Sino-U.S. exchange stabilization fund method.

<p>United Press, 29th, Washington: Senator Pepper of Florida, in a national radio address last night, said that the United States should assist the Soviet Union, Britain, and all countries resisting Hitler's aggression with every plane, every cannon, and every tank so as to defeat Hitler before he reaches the United States. Pepper said, "If we look at a map on a flat surface, the Soviet Union is separated from our country by a vast Atlantic Ocean, but if we look at the globe on a round surface, the Soviet Union is west of the Bering Strait, only a few miles from the United States. From the U.S. territory of Alaska, one can see the Soviet border across the sea." (Editor's note: On both sides of the Bering Strait, the borders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are only thirty miles apart at their narrowest point, and the two islands are only one and a half miles apart, which is of great importance to U.S. national defense.)</p>

<p>Reuters, 29th, Washington: The House Military Committee last night released a report on its weeks-long study of national defense progress. It made many criticisms of defense, saying that the United States lacked important raw materials, leading to various major oversights and delays. These shortcomings are mostly due to the lack of responsible leaders with authority and the fact that the country has focused on social reform in recent years while neglecting national security. Government officials should have a long-term vision. The authorities only establish special departments to deal with difficult problems when they arise, which only increases the confusion of decentralized powers. The most lacking important raw materials are steel and rubber.</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Capital Speculates That Japan May Attack the Soviet Union. Germany Is Forcibly Urging Japan to Join the War. Japan Is Also Thinking of Taking This Opportunity to Advance North. <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Havas, 28th, Chongqing: Observers here generally believe that Japan will continue to take a wait-and-see attitude towards the German-Soviet war, taking Germany's firm grasp of victory as the key to its fulfillment of the obligations of the Tripartite Pact and the Anti-Comintern Pact. However, some people have gradually decided to revise their opinions and assert that Japan will soon attack the Soviet Union in order to gain Germany's favor and realize its long-cherished desire to annex the area east of Lake Baikal. Their arguments are: (1) Germany is urging them very hard; (2) the active activities of pro-Axis and anti-American factions in Japan; (3) Japan has lost the opportunity to advance south and cannot let go of the opportunity to advance north again; (4) Japan needs Germany's military technology assistance and some sophisticated components and must recognize the need to open up the Eurasian land route. They also believe that when Japan implements an attack on the Soviet Union, Matsuoka will inevitably step down. According to military estimates, Japan's total military strength is 57 divisions, of which 10 divisions are stationed in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Manchuria, and at least 15 divisions are stationed in the occupied areas of North China and some areas along the coast of China. Therefore, the number that can be transferred is about 30 divisions. According to this calculation, in terms of numbers, the Japanese army is slightly superior to the Soviet Far East Army. However, in terms of equipment, the Soviet army is not weak and has solid defensive fortifications to use. Therefore, it is not easy for Japan to quickly achieve victory over the Soviet Union. In addition, once Japan launches an attack, British and Soviet military cooperation will inevitably be strengthened, and the United States will also adopt more active steps against Japan in order to contain it. At the same time, China's counterattack will be a matter of course. Therefore, Japan's attack on the Soviet Union will result in an early settlement in the Far East. In other words, China's final victory can be brought forward, it is said.</p>
<p>The Japanese Newspaper Fantasizes About the Soviet Union Again</p>
<p>United Press, 29th, Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun" today demanded that the government make a clear definition of the geographical area of Japan's co-prosperity sphere, because the possible expansion of Axis hegemony in the Asian part of the Soviet Union will cause Japan to encounter "serious problems." The "Kokumin Shimbun" pointed out that the two "new orders" recognized by the Tripartite Pact lack definite boundaries and said that Germany's war against the Soviet Union must be based on the belief that the Soviet Union should be placed under Axis power. The newspaper said, "If the Axis area should include the Soviet Union, the Near East, and Africa, why do Germany and Italy not recognize Japan's power in India, Australia, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, and in the area east of the Soviet Urals?"</p>

<p>Reuters, 29th, Atlantic City: The new British Deputy Ambassador to the United States, Campbell, said in a speech to the Maryland Bar Association last night, "When we have an unlimited supply of military supplies and can completely control the skies and the land, we can be closer to victory by another year. According to the current plan, the autumn of 1942 will be the period when the production of various supplies gradually reaches its highest level. Therefore, the belief that 1943 will see Germany take a defensive posture is not false optimism. The production competition between the United States and the Nazis has now begun, so democracies must redouble their efforts and strive for speed, working together to produce ships, aircraft, food, shells, and oil and iron," it is said.</p>

<p>United Press, 27th, Washington: Defense officials said yesterday that they expect aircraft manufacturing production to decline in the next three days due to a lack of manufacturing materials and machinery, and pointed out that the decline in production began in May, when aircraft production was only 1,334, 57 fewer than in April. This reduction in production will continue until August, as the millions of dollars used for production technology will take effect after August. However, the government has taken several remedial steps to address this production decline: (1) finding ways to reduce automobile manufacturing; (2) the Production Management Department is urging the government's eight aluminum plants to produce 600 million pounds of aluminum annually; (3) prioritizing aircraft for Britain, as the United States will be able to let Britain have 32 percent of its first-line aircraft by mid-August.</p>

<p>Reuters, 29th, London: British Minister for Economic Warfare Dalton said yesterday that oil is Hitler's economic weakness, and Hitler is not happy about the future supply of this commodity. The Nazis' recent actions in the Baltic Sea, the Near East, and the Soviet Union are for this reason. Once the oil supply falls below a certain figure, Germany will not be able to continue fighting. He was pleased to hear the news that the oil port of Constanța had been bombed and caught fire, as the port contained a large amount of oil that had been blockaded by the British and that Germany had been unable to transport out. Germany is currently launching an offensive on a 1,000-mile front in the Soviet Union, consuming a huge amount of gasoline, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e32">British Troops at Tobruk Still Hold Firm, Sheltering in Trenches Left by Italians, Bombarding German Troops with Fierce Artillery Fire <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Tobruk, 27th (Delayed) – Tobruk has been under siege by German forces, with heavy artillery fire, for three months. The isolated British troops not only hold firm but also frequently launch fierce attacks on the besieging forces. A reporter accompanying a British warship sailed into the besieged city, witnessing the extraordinary hardship of the soldiers and the impregnable nature of the defenses. The warship navigated through a path cleared in a minefield laid by German aircraft and successfully reached the port. In the pitch-black sky, red and white artillery fire flashed incessantly. The British troops retaliated fiercely, returning fire with two shells for every German shell. The battleground, spanning twenty-five miles, is located in a desolate desert bordering the blue sea. The tactics employed are similar to those used in the old-fashioned warfare of twenty-five years ago, with troops peering at each other through periscopes in trenches. The difference is that the sturdy trenches of Tobruk are built of pure cement and are a legacy of the Italian army. The German troops several miles away do not have this advantage, their earthen trenches being very simple. The trenches are separated by barbed wire. The British artillery fire is very accurate. Beyond the battlefield, the wreckage of Nazi tanks is scattered, destroyed during the attacks in April, mostly half-buried in the sand. The British troops are exceptionally brave and resolute. Even the large formations of German dive bombers cannot overcome them. It is not entirely accurate to say that Tobruk is besieged, as supplies, except for cigarettes and beer, continue to arrive. However, the Italians left behind a countless number of square-shaped cigars, so the Australian soldiers have all switched to smoking cigars. The Italians also left behind a large quantity of chutney, syrup, flour, and yeast, so the Australian soldiers are all learning to bake for themselves.</p>

<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th – According to a military spokesman here, the British and Free French forces, in the third week of their offensive into Syria, have encountered some resistance from Vichy forces, so progress toward Beirut is not rapid. However, the Allied forces have captured the key town of Nebek, 35 miles northeast of Damascus, which lies midway between Damascus and Homs. Homs is a key point on the railway to Tripoli and Aleppo. Fierce fighting is still taking place along the Ma'chai mountain range, 15 miles northwest of Damascus, with both sides seeking to seize the strategic mountain ridges.</p>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 29th – Last night, an army official stated that British and Free French forces had broken through the French lines yesterday, capturing Yabiel, 15 miles north of Damascus. It is reported that fighting is still ongoing. At the same time, large numbers of Vichy troops are concentrated behind the Turkish and Iraqi borders. British troops advancing toward Homs have not yet encountered fierce resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e34">German-Soviet War Alters World Situation, China Becomes More United Internally, Soviet Union Joins Anti-Aggression Front, Friction Between the Kuomintang and the Communists Can Be Eliminated, Zhou Enlai Advocates Attacking Japan <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Germany's attack on the Soviet Union not only clarifies the international situation but also places China's closest friend on the active anti-aggression front. It also offers hope for easing domestic political tensions in China. Leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party believe that the new front can eliminate friction between the Kuomintang and the Communists and encourage closer and more wholehearted cooperation. The Communist Party's support for Moscow, its hostility toward Britain and the United States, and its subsequent signing of a neutrality pact with Japan have all contributed to the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States' immediate assistance to the Soviet Union, and Japan's growing doubt about the value of the Japanese-Soviet pact have eliminated most of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The reason is that Kuomintang leaders often say that the Chinese Communist Party is more loyal to Moscow than to the Chinese government. However, due to the Soviet Union's new international status, the Chinese Communist Party will be more willing to cooperate with the Chinese government. In other words, the Soviet Union's joining the Chinese-British-American front will inevitably lead to the Chinese Communist Party joining as well. The Chinese Communist Party initially suspected that Britain might unite with Hitler to wage an anti-Bolshevik war, but they seem to have been reassured by Britain and the United States' guarantees of assistance to the Soviet Union. In addition, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have expressed their willingness to disregard the past and show closer understanding. The Ta Kung Pao recently commented that it was pleased to receive formal news of the Eighteenth Group Army cooperating with the central army in Pu. On the day the German army began its attack on the Soviet Union, Zhou Enlai, the Communist Party's representative in Chongqing, published an article in the Communist Party's daily newspaper, seeking peace with the Kuomintang. Zhou's article stated, "In war, China must have a center to maintain the whole country. In the past four years, this center has been Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the National Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang. When this center can lead the country to continue the war, everyone should support it. We, the Communist Party, recognize and support this center and this leader." Zhou also stated that the Communist Party recognizes and praises the Kuomintang's internal progress and development, which are essential elements for victory. Zhou said that the Communist Party's opposition to the Kuomintang is only against the stubborn elements within it. Zhou also denied that the Communist Party wants to establish its own center and overthrow the Kuomintang. In addition to this good phenomenon, it is generally acknowledged that China's comrades in the British-American front all hope that there will not be an open split within China. Due to the current situation, it seems that there is a trend to fully meet this hope. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party in Chongqing, called on the whole country today to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan when Japan begins its northward attack on the Soviet Union. Zhou urged the country to prepare greater military strength, improve military equipment and political systems, and overcome economic difficulties in preparation for a final blow to Japan in an article published in the Xinhua Daily. Zhou said that Japan is very likely to wage war against the Soviet Union, and Tokyo's hesitation is due to the following four reasons: (1) If Japan advances north, the China Incident cannot be resolved; (2) Siberia's resources are not as rich as those of the Dutch East Indies; (3) If the northward advance cannot be decided quickly, Japan's feet will be deeply mired in the snow; (4) Britain and the United States may attack Japan if it advances north. Zhou refuted the report by the Shanghai Havas Agency that the Chinese Communist Party relies on Soviet aid to survive. He said that Soviet aid is given to the whole of China and to the National Government, not to the Communist Party. (United Press, 29th)</p>

The French Embassy, adjacent to the British Embassy, was spared from disaster, although it was severely shaken. More civilians were killed and injured throughout the day. Five people were killed and thirty injured in the embassy area. (International News Service, 29th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – Fifty-four Japanese aircraft bombed Consulate Alley (where the British Embassy is located) in Chongqing city today. Three staff members of the British Embassy and the wife of one staff member were also injured. Two of the main buildings of the embassy were also damaged by bombs. The hospital of the British Methodist Church was also directly hit by a bomb, and the hospital was severely damaged and temporarily cannot function. It is reported that there were no casualties inside the hospital. The residence of Sir Charles Blacker, a counselor at the British Embassy, was directly hit by a bomb. Sir Charles's jaw was shattered. Sir Charles and embassy staff members were taking shelter in an air-raid shelter when shrapnel flew into the shelter. Sir Charles's ear was cut. Alan, a third secretary at the British Embassy, was slightly injured, and his wife was also injured in the face. In addition, Secretary Borgona was also injured in the hand. Two Chinese employees of the British Embassy were killed at the entrance to the air-raid shelter, and eleven other Chinese employees were also injured. Sir Charles Blacker's residence was hit by a bomb at 11:20 a.m. Blacker was also taken to a nearby hospital for treatment, but when the second wave of aircraft arrived at 1:20 p.m., Blacker was taken back to the embassy's air-raid shelter, thus delaying treatment. According to his Chinese surgeon, who is a close attendant, Blacker's injuries are not serious, but he may require surgery. Blacker is now in the hospital, while Alan and his wife and Borgona have been discharged from the hospital after treatment. In addition to the direct hit and destruction of Charles Blacker's residence, another large bomb landed in the kitchen of the main building where the ambassador's office is located. The house has not collapsed, but its interior is almost completely destroyed. A large unexploded bomb landed on the lawn fifteen feet in front of the house. The small buildings of the consulate were only slightly damaged. Diplomatic circles have announced that former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi have sent words of condolence to the British Ambassador Archibald Clark Kerr. It is understood that the British Ambassador intends to report today's attack to London. The four Britons were injured because they were standing near the entrance to the air-raid shelter, and fragments of the building flew into the entrance. Sir Charles Blacker was transferred to the west of the so-called safe area on the south bank of the Yangtze River this afternoon. More than a dozen bombs also fell there. It is reported that a small village there was bombed, killing more than twenty people. The house of the American clergyman Macaude was also slightly damaged. Macaude himself left this morning to return home on vacation, but his wife and daughter remained in Chongqing. (United Press, 29th)</p>

<p>Japanese Aircraft Attack Guangdong</p>
<p>Sihui, Guangdong – Maoming, the military and political center of southern Guangdong, is located in a remote area and has always been an undefended city. Japanese aircraft bombed it in March, June, and September of the 28th year of the Republic. On the 24th of this month, nine Japanese aircraft took off from Hainan Island, flew over Shuidong, and swooped down on Maocheng, dropping multiple explosive and incendiary bombs on the city.

<p>Chongqing – The movement to rebuild the Chinese Air Force seems to have been very quiet recently, but it is actually still in full swing. According to those in charge of the Aviation Association, the goal of rebuilding the air force is 2,000 aircraft. If all sectors at home and abroad work together, it should not be difficult to achieve this goal. It is now scheduled to start a one-yuan movement on July 7th. Given the current high cost of living, it is by no means difficult for people to contribute one yuan. Therefore, domestically, the authorities of various provinces and military departments will lead, with counties, townships, towns, and pao-chia as the backbone, in order to strive for universal application. Overseas, Chen Qingyun will go to preside over it, in order to achieve the goal quickly. According to Chen, he received donations of 5.56 million US dollars when he went to the United States. This decision to go to Southeast Asia, the results must not be weak. Domestically, Sichuan Province has already had a movement to donate 100 aircraft, and Hechuan County has already donated three aircraft alone. Hunan Province is working hard to promote the movement of one aircraft per county. (Havas, 28th)</p>

In fact, Iran has always strictly adhered to neutrality. This report has no basis whatsoever. If the people of the Italian Radio continue to report such unfounded rumors, we will stop listening."</p>

<h3 id="e49">European War Musings (65): The Reality of Britain's Arduous Struggle <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>However, we must not underestimate the German Air Force. Even with the assistance of the United States, the new British Air Force must still exert its full strength to cope with future German offensives. As for the most pressing need of the British Army, it is tanks, and more tanks. Many commanders I have encountered in recent months are eagerly hoping that the rate at which factories manufacture tanks can keep pace with the training of personnel.</p>
<p>One day, I obtained permission from the authorities to witness the new tank manufacturing program that is currently progressing. The speed at which tanks are manufactured in secret factories is far greater than in the past. After production, they are sent to the ordnance depot and then distributed to various battalions for the defense of the British Isles or for use overseas.</p>
<p>Although the allocation of these tanks is currently focused on defending the homeland, a group of army generals certainly hopes that they can be used overseas soon. The elite troops defending the homeland all acknowledge that they can only fulfill their mission of defending the homeland when the time is ripe for Britain to send troops to the European continent to launch a large-scale offensive.</p>
<p>Of course, it is forbidden to publish information regarding the number of tanks manufactured or other details that could provide clues. However, if we understand the complexity of this tank mechanism, we can easily understand the significant difficulties in accelerating its manufacture.</p>
<p>Take the patrol tank as an example. Its appearance is simpler than an ordinary steamroller, but it actually contains 6,200 different parts, with more than 50,000 different mechanical and matching functions. The cost of this type of tank is approximately £1,000 per ton, which is even more expensive than a bomber. Moreover, the engineering involved in manufacturing tanks is extremely precise, with some parts requiring precision to one ten-thousandth of an inch.</p>
<p>In one factory, the reporter saw as many as 500 different types of manufacturing machines, all powered by electricity. A single piece of steel plate can ultimately be made into a complete tank, driving automatically and ready for road or cross-country testing.</p>
<p>If you have never seen a tank, you cannot imagine its agile movement, balanced stability, and flexibility. A heavy tank weighs up to 15 tons and can crash through houses, crawling over rough terrain with exceptional comfort. They can turn around in three seconds, as agile as polo horses, and are actually faster than ordinary cars.</p>
<p>Although machinery as precise as tanks is not suitable for mass production, factories are still working hard on designs to ensure the simultaneous construction of the maximum number of tanks. The reporter saw its assembly mechanism, which was spacious enough to allow a complete tank to be lifted by a 20-ton crane onto another tank.</p>
<p>In the tank manufacturing factories, in addition to men, women are also employed. The machines used come from various countries, even including those purchased from Germany. The reporter saw brand names such as Hamburg, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Montreuil on the machines.</p>
<p>Accompanying me on the inspection were two British officers from Egypt. They both said that the army recognizes the skills of the craftsmen, and General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, recently stated in a telegram that although many Italian tanks are the latest models, they are no match for British tanks. British desert patrols have traveled no less than 500,000 miles, but not a single tank has been lost due to mechanical failure.</p>
<p>The reporter asked an officer how British tanks compared to German tanks. Based on his experience in the battle of Flanders before the fall of France and Belgium, he replied: "We rarely have the opportunity to judge their merits, but in every battle, British tanks seem to fully fulfill their duties."</p>
<p>This experience, of course, cannot be taken as conclusive, because at that time, Britain only had one armored division fighting in France and never had a chance to prove itself except for defense. After the retreat from Dunkirk, Britain did not even have an armored division left. Those tanks, like other vehicles and artillery, were completely lost in France.</p>
<p>In contrast, the German army had countless tanks, often pushing forward with about 100 tanks simultaneously on a 1,500-yard-wide front. The German army has always had a numerical advantage in tanks, especially light tanks. The British army no longer attaches importance to light tanks, and after the Dunkirk campaign, the German army must have learned a lesson from the heavy tanks used by the British army.</p>
<p>Moreover, Britain today is not only at war, but also undergoing a revolution.</p>
<p>When, where, and how this war will be won remains unknown, but one fact is already clear: the Britain of today is different from the Britain of two years ago, and the Britain after the war will undergo even more drastic changes.</p>
<p>What will Britain become?</p>
<p>In the United States, many questions are often heard: What kind of country are we helping? To what extent has Britain changed now, and what will it become after the war? Will it become socialist? Is there a danger of national socialism?"</p>
<p>In order to obtain answers to these many questions, the reporter has traveled throughout Britain and talked with farmers, workers, Labor Party leaders, Conservatives, Liberals, two Labor Party representatives in the cabinet, social service workers, women's leaders, and other various people.</p>
<p>After extensive investigation, the reporter believes without a doubt that Britain is in the midst of a revolution. But this is a standard British-style revolution, not radical, not extreme, and not sudden, and the people are not even aware of it. However, this revolution has profound significance, not only economically but also socially, and not only socially but also politically, and is not only a temporary effect of the war but actually has permanent qualities.</p>
<p>This revolution has brought about fundamental changes in British society, but it does not contradict tradition, which is a standard British characteristic. This revolution has overturned several long-established special positions, but this transformation is gradual and gentle, and it is still a special British-style revolution.</p>
<p>In social terms, the major reform brewing is an equalizing effect. It would be incorrect to say that the British class system has been abolished. The class system has not been abolished and will not be abolished, at least not in this generation. However, class discrimination has clearly decreased. The class system is very likely to coexist with the war and post-war reforms, but there will undoubtedly be many changes.</p>
<p>In this war, people of all classes are equally sweating and bleeding, which is a major reason, and bombing is the biggest driving force for equalization.</p>
<p>The other day, I had dinner with a noble lady and learned that she sleeps in the basement almost every night. This basement was originally the servants' dining room. Her maid sleeps on a bed close to her. The servants' living room in the basement is occupied by two elderly couples who escaped from the Dunkirk area. The hostess has been getting along with them for several months, and their affection has increased day by day. Before going to bed every night, she must give them a warm hug.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the air raid patrol and the home guard have also greatly increased the idea of equal danger and equal service.</p>
<p>In the home guard, it is common for former officers and gardeners, drivers, and servants to be in the same ranks. Gentlemen and workers often stand together all night, acting as watchmen against paratroopers. Sometimes, plumbers and bankers are also assigned to patrol the same street.</p>
<p>Examples of the complete elimination of "class consciousness" in the sound of bombing are too numerous to mention. There is no doubt that a new friendship, a new fraternity, and enthusiasm have emerged in Britain today. These new products are the most powerful and far-reaching elements of this social revolution.</p>
<p>Economic factors have also accelerated the process of equalization. The war-time taxes on the rich and middle class are the heaviest. Income tax starts at 40 percent, and those with meager incomes can be reduced to 25 percent or less.</p>
<p>But for those with high incomes, the surtax has skyrocketed to 90 percent. In addition, there is an excessive profits tax, which is a severe measure to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. After its implementation, the annual profits of any large company or enterprise cannot exceed the situation in 1937 or 1938.</p>
<p>Britain's methods of cracking down on war profiteering are very strict. After careful investigation by the reporter, it is said that although manufacturers who sign contracts with the government can circumvent the regulations and obtain more profits than before the war, it is generally impossible to profit from the national crisis in Britain.

<h3 id="e50">French Municipal Council's Affordable Rice: Citywide Sale Next Month, Managed by Various Foreign Firms but Subject to Control, First Batch of Public Warehouse Rice Expected to Arrive in Port Day After Tomorrow <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Rice Shops Selling Short Weight, the Guild Has Thoroughly Investigated</p>
<p>The first batch of 27,150 bags of Yangon small-grain rice, handled by the Food Rice Public Warehouse organized by Yu Qiaqing and others, has been loaded onto the "Gray" ship and is coming to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in port on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow (2nd). According to an employee of the Dafoe foreign firm in charge, a total of 80,000 bags of this small-grain rice were ordered at the end of March. Due to delays in the ship schedule, the shipment has been delayed until now. Recently, the firm received a telegram from Yangon stating that the remaining 52,850 bags will be shipped to Shanghai for supply as soon as possible, and the shipment date is set before July 15th.</p>
<p>Retail Rice Shops: Selling Both Types</p>
<p>According to sources in the foreign firm community, since the French Municipal Council's discounted Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice, managed by 14 foreign firms of the Import Committee, has been sold, the total quantity sold is about 100,000 bags. The 10,000 bags distributed by the Shenji Foreign Firm arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of this month. The 4,500 bags distributed by the Dafoe Foreign Firm are also expected to arrive in port on the 4th of next month. Because the Saigon broken rice is a June futures contract, other foreign firms, such as Heyi, Fujia, and Jinfat, have already shipped their distributed rice from Saigon before the end of this month. According to sources from the Import Committee, in the middle of next month, retail rice shops throughout the city, in addition to selling discounted small-grain rice, can also sell discounted Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Only Half Sold Despite First Batch Arriving in Full</p>
<p>As of the "Yusheng" ship, which arrived in port on the 28th, a total of 120,000 bags of discounted small-grain rice arrived this month. Together with the more than 161,000 bags shipped last month, there were a total of more than 280,000 bags. The first batch of foreign rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council from the Hong Kong government has been fully shipped. According to rice industry statistics, only about half of the ordered quantity has been sold so far. This is because most residents in the area have purchased and stored rice in the past, and larger groups and factories also have large amounts of reserves. It is common to store for one or two months. Hoarders who currently hold large amounts of spot goods are hoping to sell them by purchasing from the local firms, which is very difficult. In addition, discounted foreign rice is constantly pouring in, and rice prices continue to fall. Speculators who hoarded in the past will soon suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Dingxingtai Shop Selling Short Weight</p>
<p>According to reports from the Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association, the Dingxingtai Rice Shop at 134 Hart Road in the Public Concession recently sold one dan of Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice, which was more than ten catties short of weight. The association has already notified member rice shops to comply with the regulations that the Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice is sold at 160 catties per dan, and short weight is not allowed by law. The association has dispatched officers to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e53">New Cargo Ship under the Jurisdiction of the US Shipping Council Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Carrying 10,000 Bags of Wheat Donated by the American Red Cross, Maintaining Shipping by Coming East Monthly Thereafter <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The new cargo ship "Flyer", designated by the US Shipping Council to sail the Pacific Far East route, with a deadweight of 6,751 tons, arrived in Shanghai at 7:35 a.m. yesterday from Seattle, USA, under the command of Captain Sturland, carrying 3,000 tons of cargo.</p>
<p>Carrying US Wheat to Relieve Refugees</p>
<p>The ship was also entrusted by the American Red Cross to transport 10,000 bags of US wheat to Shanghai for disaster relief to help refugees in the Shanghai area. One part is said to be designated for allocation to the Association of Jewish Refugees Exiled in Shanghai. According to sources from the Shanghai office of the American Red Cross, medical supplies for disaster relief and relief purposes from the American Red Cross will continue to be shipped in the near future.</p>
<p>Another Ship Expected to Arrive Next Month</p>
<p>Although the ship's name has not been announced, it is learned from the "Xinsheng" newspaper that it is the "Flyer"'s sister ship, the "Arriva". The ship was also built by the US Shipping Council to run to the Far East and is expected to arrive here on July 16th carrying cargo. The ship's deadweight is completely the same as that of the "Flyer".</p>
<p>"Flyer" to Sail to Shanghai Monthly</p>
<p>The "Flyer", which arrived here yesterday morning, was built by the Tacoma Shipyard in Washington and is made entirely of copper. It is 418 feet long, 60 feet wide, has a net deadweight of 3,964 tons, a speed of 14 knots per hour, and a capacity of 8,500 tons. It was built a month ago and handed over to the US Shipping Council for control and dispatch to operate on the Pacific Far East route. The ship is berthed at the Gonghexing Wharf and will come to Shanghai once a month thereafter.</p>
<p>Another Cargo Ship Also Arrived in Port Yesterday</p>
<p>The cargo ship "Langin Bay", represented by the American President Lines, also arrived here yesterday morning, delayed by one day from the original date, carrying 2,000 tons of US cargo. It began unloading on the same day and is scheduled to return to San Francisco via Honolulu in two or three days.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Western Newspaper Comments on the German-Soviet War, German Troops Encounter Strong Enemy, Soviet Union Not Comparable to France and Other Countries, Powerful Strength Will Surely Have Surprising Actions <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The English "Great American Weekly" commented on the "Soviet-German War" yesterday: "The Soviet-German War has reached one week today. Although we are far away from the battlefield and cannot obtain real news, there is one thing that can be believed from the conflicting telegrams from all parties: the Red Army's strong resistance is indeed in progress, forcing the Nazi troops to retreat in some areas. Although the Soviet Union was caught off guard by the speed of this war, they have been able to bravely resist and demand a great price from the Germans. It is an undeniable fact that the German side has achieved some victories so far, but the situation is very different from the past. It is currently impossible to predict whether Germany's encounter in the Soviet Union can be the same as in Norway, the Netherlands, France, Greece, and Yugoslavia. The Nazi state is only now facing an enemy several times stronger than other countries for the first time, and it is the first time it has fought against a proletarian state, and its enemy has been preparing for war for several years. Germany should decide quickly, but its enemy has a vast territory, enough for its army to make strategic retreats when necessary. Germany has many difficulties, such as if the Soviet army retreats into the islands and mountains and continues to resist, the Soviet Union will have to station a large army in the Soviet territory west of that mountain range to control it. This area is almost as large as other parts of Europe, so the German army must station a large army in each railway station, important transportation location, town, and other places. Unless the Soviet Union compromises or the German army is unable to retreat after a major defeat, and the German garrison will certainly find that the Soviet Union is neither France nor the various countries currently occupied by Germany. Because the Soviet Union is a laboring country and there are no new facilities in the country, the German army will feel bored if they stay in the Soviet Union for a long time. In the long process of leisure, it can actually cause a major failure of the German military."</p>

<p>The British Overseas Association of Shanghai held its third special meeting at the racecourse the day before yesterday. Chairman Shankela first elected Johnston as Chairman of the Wartime Group Committee, Anderson as Vice Chairman of the Congress, and Sullivan as the representative of the Canadian Association. Then, Chairman Ke reported on various tasks, divided into three points: first, the work of the Wartime Group Committee; second, the establishment of the League of Democratic Group Countries; third, the economic situation of the association. After the chairman's report, Johnston reported on the achievements of the Wartime Group Committee, and Bode reported on the situation of the Shanghai War Savings Association. Then, the British Consul General George gave a speech, and finally, Mayne reported on the wartime work of British women.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Refugee Relief Association's Funding is Strained, Actively Repatriating Refugees, Currently Still Housing More Than 13,000 People, Rising Prices, Fewer Donations, Difficult to Maintain <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of the reduction in donation income and the increase in living expenses, has been carrying out evacuation work since January of this year. However, due to the high cost of living in the city, the general refugees are deeply afraid that they will not be able to make a living once they leave the facility, so most of them are unwilling to leave. Therefore, the association first evacuated a part of the young and strong refugees. It is estimated that since January, the total number of evacuations has accounted for one-fourth. The total number of refugees currently remaining in the facility has been reduced to more than 13,000, with men accounting for three-tenths and women and children accounting for seven-tenths.</p>
<p>Increasing Repatriation Fees to Encourage Leaving the Facility</p>
<p>In order to encourage refugees to leave the facility, the association has further increased the repatriation fee. It is estimated that the repatriation fee for adults has increased from 22 yuan to 33 yuan per person, and the repatriation fee for children has increased from 17 yuan to 25 yuan per person. However, there are still few people who accept this repatriation fee and leave the facility. This is because most of these people are villagers from the suburbs of the city, their houses have been destroyed, and most of their fields have been used for other purposes, making it impossible for them to return to their hometowns. Moreover, because these people in the facility can solve the problem of food and lodging, and can freely go out to work and peddle, etc., if they are suddenly ordered to leave the facility, their personal income will not be able to maintain the livelihood of their families.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Donations, Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>According to a person from the Relief Association, the refugee living problem has also increased due to the sharp increase in rice and coal prices in the city. It is estimated that the monthly living expenses per person were 9 yuan in national currency in March, but have now increased to 13 yuan. Based on the current number of more than 13,000 refugees, the living expenses will require more than 210,000 yuan in national currency per month. However, donations from all parties are less than in the past, so in addition to making every effort to carry out evacuation work, we also hope that all sectors will generously donate.</p>
<p>Newspaper Advertisement, Monthly Income and Expenses</p>
<p>The total amount of income and expenses of the association in May has been settled yesterday and announced to all sectors in the newspaper. It is estimated that the income is 200,080 yuan and 76 cents in national currency, and the expenditure is 176,397 yuan and 44 cents for living expenses, 4,810 yuan and 05 cents for repatriation fees, and 15,214 yuan and 90 cents for medical expenses.</p>
<p>Xiejih Middle School Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>Zhejiang Road Xiejih Middle School was founded by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The more than 200 students are all students who have lost their studies due to the impact of the war. Since its establishment, it has been three years. This year is the graduation period for the junior high school class, so a graduation ceremony will be held at 9:00 a.m. today, and the school's directors Wen Lanting and Huang Hanzhi will be invited to participate. It is heard that the school will add a senior high school class in the next semester.</p>

<p>The more than 500 tea shops in the city have a total of 1,500 to 600 employees. Due to the impact of soaring prices, their monthly income is not enough to cover their expenses. Therefore, they jointly submitted conditions to the shop owners, requesting improved treatment and increased salaries. Because they were not invited to approve, labor disputes such as work slowdowns occurred. It is learned that the company side held a meeting on the evening of the day before yesterday to discuss solutions, but there has been no practical response to the demands raised by the labor side, so the labor side is very angry and has already left the shop individually, forming a strike situation. It is heard that several employees were arrested yesterday, so the future of the industry's dispute is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e58">European Postal Route Schedule <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office has now compiled a new postal schedule. Due to the reduction in mail, the Siberian Railway line has been changed to two dispatches per week. One batch will be loaded onto the train on the 30th to transfer to Yuguan to connect with the Middle East Road and the Siberian Railway. The packaging will be done at 8:00 p.m. The Pacific route mail is recently scheduled to be transported by ship from Shanghai on July 4th, and the quantity will increase sharply compared to before. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, several batches of mail that were previously transported from Shanghai to Central Europe via Siberia have been unable to be transported after arriving in Moscow due to the war and are still stranded in the Soviet Union, waiting for the war situation to evolve.</p>

<p>Today is the end of June in the 30th year of the Republic of China. Member banks and firms of the Banking and Financial Industry Association have completed the settlement of interest for commercial and savings accounts one after another. Settlement notices have been issued to various accounts, and the final accounts for the first half of the year will be handled from today. As for industry and commerce, they are also handling the semi-annual settlement. Therefore, the various banks and firms are busy with collection and disbursement, and the amount of note exchange has increased sharply. Starting tomorrow, the banking and financial industries and various industry markets will be closed for two days and will resume business on July 3rd. Regarding the entire Shanghai financial situation, thanks to the efforts of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank to adjust, and the maintenance of the joint reserve of the banking and financial industries, it remains stable as ever, with ample funds and no signs of tension, so various industries can pass this June accounting period peacefully. It is heard that the Member Representative Assembly of the Banking Industry Association for the first half of the year has been decided to be suspended due to this extraordinary period, and the Member Representative Assembly of the Financial Industry Association has also been decided to be suspended. The call rate market for June has been changed to be decided by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>In summer, everything on the road seems exceptionally bright compared to usual, especially the most deserted roads in the western suburbs. First, because the sunlight is very strong during the day, and there are a few circles of light, cotton-like white clouds dotting the azure sky, the atmosphere of nature is very clear. Second, the trees planted on both sides of the road have lush green leaves in summer, and the branches and leaves reflect each other, which harmonizes well with the clean streets washed by the rain. If we walk alone on this deserted road, we feel that the surrounding scenery evokes our different emotions, especially when we return home from the bustling city and pass through these quiet places, it feels like another world.</p>

<p>After Mr. Yu Qiaqing left Shanghai for Hong Kong to investigate resources in the Northwest, he recognized the abundance of resources in the Northwest, such as coal, iron, mineral products, cotton, and wool, all of which are essential commodities for China during wartime.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for development to meet the country's needs. Therefore, he specially collaborated with the banking and industrial sectors of Shanghai and Hong Kong to initiate the organization of the Northwest Enterprise Company, engaging in the development of the vast resources of the Northwest. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the industrial sector yesterday that after Mr. Yu returned to Hong Kong from his investigation, he immediately invited leaders from the banking and industrial sectors of Shanghai and Hong Kong to a meeting. First, Mr. Yu reported on his findings from the investigation, hoping to mobilize and guide the various banks and industrial sectors in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Leaders expressed their support and willingness to assist him in completing this great plan as soon as possible. It is heard that the name of the company is tentatively set as "Northwest Enterprise Company," with a capital tentatively set at 10 million national currency. Mr. Yu himself is willing to invest 2.5 million yuan first. As soon as the capital is fully subscribed, an announcement will be made to establish the company.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society Conducts Systematic Lectures <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The 18th Sutra Lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society was given by Mr. Shen Jueling, who said: Starting from this session, we plan to give systematic lectures that cannot be completed in one session. The topic is "We Confucian scholars should embody Confucius's intention of teaching without discrimination and jointly shoulder the responsibility of harmonizing the five religions." The first section is the history of the five religions.</p>
<p>I previously lectured on Confucius's doctrines without limiting them to Confucianism, not daring to belittle Confucianism. Confucius's personality and teachings far exceeded what the world calls Confucianism, and Confucianism was indeed respected because of Confucius's words in the "Confucian Conduct" chapter of the Book of Rites. Confucianism has had a long relationship with our country's history, and the name of Tao was known earlier than it, and it should not be regarded merely as the Tao of Taoism. Confucius even said in the "Li Ren" chapter of the Analects, "If I hear of the Tao in the morning, I can die content in the evening." The "Doctrine of the Mean" in the Book of Rites says, "What Heaven imparts to man is called nature. To follow our nature is called the Tao. The cultivation of the Tao is called instruction. The Tao is that from which we may not stray for an instant. If we can stray from it, it cannot be the Tao." From this, we know that all who speak of instruction cannot stray from the Tao. If we stray from the Tao, it is not instruction. How can the word Tao be monopolized by Taoists? Is it not what the five religions share?</p>
<p>The oldest books of what are now called Taoism are Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu. Only the seven inner chapters and the "Tianxia" chapter of Zhuang Tzu can be credibly considered not forgeries; the remaining chapters contain many forgeries. Sima Qian and his son, his father Tan placed Tao before Confucianism, and Qian placed Confucianism before Taoism. This was because during the Western Han Dynasty, Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing revered Huang-Lao, and Emperor Wu honored Confucianism. The atmosphere of the era changed accordingly, and the Sima family's scholarship could not help but be influenced by it. Qian's reverence for Confucius as the supreme sage was truly a unique insight of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Buddhism entered China during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Eastern Han Dynasty, according to the Zizhi Tongjian, in the eighth year of Emperor Ming's Yongping reign. The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" in the Book of Wei says, "When Sakyamuni was born, it was in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu in the Spring and Autumn period, when a constant star was not seen on a bright night." Taoism originated from Lao Tzu. The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" also records, "In the eighth year of Taichang, on the day of Wuxu in the tenth month, the Master of Pasturing Earth, Li Puwen, came to Mount Song, claiming to be the great-grandson of Lao Tzu. He used to live in Sangqian in the Dai Commandery. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he attained the Tao and became the Lord of the Pasturing Earth Palace. He also said that between the two poles there are thirty-six heavens, with thirty palaces in them, each with a lord, the highest being the Ultimate Supreme, deciding on the Great True Venerable to decide on the covering of the heavens and the carrying of the earth! Yin and Yang True Venerable, deciding on the Hongzheng True Venerable." The propagation of the two religions was so miraculous. Today, the Yungang Grottoes west of Datong County, Shanxi Province, are stacked like buildings, with large and small Buddha statues densely distributed in layers, and the carvings are exquisite, making them a unique art in the East, still a relic of the Northern Wei Dynasty.</p>
<p>By the Tang Dynasty, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism were equally valued. Lao Tzu was exclusively honored as Emperor Xuanyuan, simply because he shared the same surname as the imperial family. At the same time, Christianity, called Nestorianism, had already entered China, according to the Nestorian Stele, in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong's Zhenguan reign. Islam also entered China during the Tang Dynasty, with two theories: the second year of Emperor Taizong's Zhenguan reign and the second year of Emperor Gaozong's Yonghui reign. According to the basic annals of Emperor Gaozong in the Old Book of Tang, the Great Food State first sent envoys to pay tribute in the eighth month of the second year of Yonghui. The biographies of the Great Food in both the Old and New Books of Tang all record the year but not the month and day, so the second year of Yonghui is credible. In short, these five religions all have historical relationships in our country, and customs and people's hearts are all subject to a portion of their influence, which is an undeniable fact.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Physician Qu Shaoheng Expresses Opinions on Midwifery Teacher Training: Modern Women Must Understand Midwifery Knowledge; Teachers Should Have Special Training <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Childbirth is something that every family experiences, and every woman cannot avoid it. In the old customs of our country, we have always relied on midwives, who have no knowledge and lack reasonable experience. When entrusted with childbirth, they cannot prepare in advance, and often make mistakes afterward. When faced with difficult labor, they are at a loss. At best, they harm the fetus, and at worst, they bring disaster to the pregnant woman. Families who are confused by superstition only seek help from gods and Buddhas, and never make scientific rescues. Throughout the year, countless lives are lost in this way in the city of wrongful death.</p>
<p>Outline of Obstetrics</p>
<p>The highest education administrative authorities of the National Government, in view of this, have recently ordered the addition of an outline of obstetrics to the original physiology courses in girls' middle schools. Shanghai schools are currently discussing its implementation. Shaoheng has been practicing medicine and has devoted his efforts to obstetrics and gynecology. In Beijing and Shanghai, he decided to establish midwifery schools, aiming to popularize the common sense that every family needs and everyone should know into the minds of ordinary female compatriots. He also suggested to the education authorities that middle school girls should be instilled with obstetrical knowledge. Fortunately, the authorities ordered the addition of an outline of obstetrics to the original physiology courses in girls' middle schools. His 30-year-old wish has now been implemented by the wise authorities, and he privately rejoices.</p>
<p>Scientific Midwifery</p>
<p>There are also those in the educational circles of this city who inquire about the issue of teacher training. He once replied, "Adding an outline of obstetrics to girls' middle schools is not to have them perform midwifery duties, nor is it to have them study profound theories. In simple terms, it is to have them understand that obstetrics is related to the rise and fall of the nation. Childbirth is an extremely dangerous event, but if handled properly, it can turn danger into safety and be safe and sound. Therefore, if there is a pregnant person in the family, they must pay attention in advance, entrust the matter to the right person when the time comes, and take reasonable care afterward. Only by understanding the truth can they believe and obey. Therefore, future virtuous wives and good mothers must first be taught the importance of midwifery in schools, so that when they encounter childbirth in their families, it can be scientificized, so that the four words 'scientific childbirth' are deeply imprinted in everyone's minds. In that case, getting one pregnancy and giving birth to one person, the infant is healthy, the mother is safe, the reproduction of the population is the increase of national strength, and the well-being of the pregnant woman will avoid the weakening of the nation."</p>
<p>Teaching Points</p>
<p>From this, talking about the issue of teachers for the general knowledge course of midwifery, will we seek physicians who are proficient in theory? No. Will we seek midwives with accumulated experience? No. We must specially train those who are said to be experts in the theory of obstetrics, who must be able to explain it clearly and thoroughly. Regarding the techniques of midwifery, they must be able to explain it clearly and concisely. Time is limited, and in this short amount of time, they must instill the essential words that contain infinite meaning. They must grasp a central issue and explain all kinds of knowledge in a dazzling array, so that students, after attending this class, feel like they have watched a movie. When listening, they are focused, and when they leave class and go home, they tell their families about it with relish. In this way, they can achieve the purpose of the Ministry of Education's special order to add an outline of obstetrics.</p>
<p>Teacher Training</p>
<p>Next, talking about the issue of teachers, if physicians can refer to obstetrics, they can be competent. If not, midwifery graduates who have been practicing for three or several years can also be prepared to take on the task. However, teachers have teaching methods, especially for this kind of subject. Without special training, it is difficult to be pleasantly competent. Currently, in extraordinary times, Shanghai is a major trading port and a cultural center. Although it is an isolated island, education is concentrated and even surpasses the pre-war period. Taking midwifery schools as an example, there are six schools: Sino-German, Great German, Tongde, Shengsheng, Renhe, and Hygiene. There are also many graduates who practice or work in hospitals. In his humble opinion, each school should jointly set up a teacher training institute, recruit ambitious graduates, and train them, so as to alleviate the teacher shortage. As for the need for teachers in various places, qualified people can also be selected to enter the institute for training. After completing the study period, they will return to their respective services, wouldn't that be extremely convenient and satisfactory?</p>

<p>Chen Yun, a 23-year-old from Haiyan, Zhejiang, used to be a clerk in the Haiyan County government and is now unemployed. He lives in his brother's house at a certain number on Dongxin Bridge. Chen met Shen Xueying, a 19-year-old female guide from the West Lake Guide Agency, a native of Wuxi, a month ago. They fell in love at first sight and became deeply in love, privately vowing to be together for life. Unexpectedly, Chen Yun suddenly felt economic pressure recently and could not marry Shen Xueying. He became mentally disturbed and depressed. The day before yesterday afternoon, he went alone to the Daxin Hotel at 442 Guangxi Road in the Public Concession, booked room 322, paid the room fee, and then telephoned Shen Xueying. Shortly after, Shen arrived at the Daxin Hotel and entered the room. Chen Yun got up to greet her, and they talked and laughed as usual. Unexpectedly, at around 7 pm last night, Chen Yun and Shen Xueying both swallowed a large amount of poison and committed suicide. Later, the waiter discovered it and immediately called an ambulance to send the two to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that they were deeply poisoned and their lives were in danger.</p>

<p>This painting is from the hand of Lu Shiqian of Haining, imitating Wu Yushan, from which one can glimpse Wu Yushan's imitation of Fei Heshanqiao's technique. Huang He was a Yuan painter. Shiqian once said that since the time of the six masters of the Song Dynasty, Jing, Guan, Ma, Xia, Dong, and Ju, they have been the masters of painting for all ages. Since the Yuan Dynasty, Huang, Wang, Ni, and Wu have all followed Dong and Ju. Later generations called the two masters Dong and Ju the Southern School, and the four masters Jing, Guan, Ma, and Xia the Northern School. However, the principles are the same. The Northern School emphasizes penmanship, and the Southern School emphasizes spirit and charm. Both are excellent. From the Yuan Dynasty to the late Ming Dynasty, Dong Qichang founded the Southern School and rejected the Northern School. Since the Qing Dynasty, those who wrote in the Northern School have been as rare as morning stars. After the four Wangs, Wu, and Yun, no one has ever consulted its principles. Shiqian believes that the Northern and Southern Schools, the Northern is difficult and the Southern is easy, cannot be separated. Separating from the Northern School weakens the bone strength, and separating from the Southern School loses the spirit and charm. Seeking the combination of penmanship, spirit, and charm can be found in the paintings of Lu Shiqian, one can know the origin of the schools and obtain the samadhi of painting Zen.</p>

<p>On May 19, at around 3 pm, an electric tram on Route 16 of the Public Concession, traveling from the McGonagall Road station to the vicinity of the Shanhai Pass Road and Carter Road, suddenly caught fire in the third-class section of the car. The ticket seller did not have time to open the iron gate, causing more than 20 passengers to be severely burned. They all jumped out of the windows to escape. A total of 18 men and women were injured, and nine people died from their injuries. At that time,</p>
<p>The cause of the accident was unknown, suspected that rioters threw bombs, deliberately sabotaging, the truth was unknown. It was not until 8 am on the 20th of this month that Hua Detective Feng Baishun, Huang Fusen, and Detective Liang Yuliang of the Huishi Detective Office found out that the culprit was Ni Jikang, a Wuxi native and button merchant at No. 150, Lane 87, Connaught Road. At that time, he was carrying a bag of celluloid green buttons, weighing 20 pounds, intending to send them to Tai'an Zhan Yongyuzhuang on Xiang Street in the French Concession. Who knew that someone in the car threw a cigarette butt on the</p>
<p>Button bag, causing the fire. He was immediately arrested at No. 150, Lane 87, Connaught Road, and escorted to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. The circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. Previously, presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi opened a court to investigate and try the case. The Detective Office lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution in accordance with the criminal law of causing death by negligence, saying that the defendant knew that the celluloid buttons were extremely flammable and should not have been carrying them in a crowded tram, and that he was not careful, causing the great disaster.</p>
<p>Please sentence him severely. Then, more than ten injured people who had recovered from the Bao Lung Hospital, including Lu Shunlin, Wang Deming, Mrs. Lu, Mrs. Ye, and Mrs. Song Dai, testified about their burns at the time, showed their scars, and questioned the defendant.

<p>Liu Yaochang, a 45-year-old Suzhou native, lives at No. 6, Lane 18, Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge. His father, Liu Dongsheng, also known as Liu Dakui, opened the Quanchang Jewelry and Antique Shop on Nanjing Road and accumulated hundreds of thousands of assets. He lived with Tao Zhihao (50 years old this year) in concubinage at No. 106, Xuehua Fang, Xuehuali Road. Liu Dongsheng passed away on August 29, 1940. Tao took the opportunity when Liu's eldest son, Yaochang, went out to do business and sold all of the inheritance, antiques, and clothing. She also treated Dongsheng's biological daughter, Liu Sujun (21 years old), in every way, and neglected the household. She also forced Sujun to leave the family. Recently, she secretly used Dongsheng's wife's name to deceive the Shanghai Salt Industry Bank into opening Dongsheng's rented safety deposit box No. 518, claiming to break the box. Now, Dongsheng's eldest son, Liu Yaochang, has returned to Shanghai and learned of this. He immediately raised an objection to the bank and entrusted lawyer Wang Dazhong to represent him in filing a legal resolution against Tao Zhihao, accusing her of crimes such as seizing the inheritance.</p>

<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Cao Wenhai, a reader of our newspaper, which stated (excerpted above): "Children born in this era can truly be called 'unfortunate.' Why? Because the only happiness is that parents send their children to school. A person who does not study or cannot read is equivalent to being useless. It is pitiful that young children, just as they are happily carrying their schoolbags and diligently attending school, the environment in Shanghai suddenly changed drastically. Schools are relocating, teachers are frequently changing, and students cannot study in peace.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an 'isolated island,' prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased daily. It is already difficult to support a family of several people. For the educational expenses of their children, those in the propertied class are better off, but ordinary parents who rely solely on wages for a living are financially strained and cannot make ends meet. To ask them to pay for their children's education expenses is a real struggle.</p>
<p>Amidst the rising cost of living, school tuition fees are also increasing. Recalling the expenses for primary school three or four years ago, fourteen or fifteen yuan per semester, including books, was enough. Some public primary schools even cost less than ten yuan. How cheap that was!</p>
<p>Although tuition fees had already increased last year, primary school tuition was at most twenty-five yuan per semester, including books and all miscellaneous fees. However, even then, parents were already struggling to bear the burden. This year, it's even worse. Tuition for lower primary school has increased to twenty-six yuan, and with books and all miscellaneous fees, the total comes to thirty-four or thirty-five yuan. Upper primary school requires an additional ten yuan. This is for day students. If they are boarding students, they must add boarding fees. As for middle school tuition, the tuition for day students used to be just over twenty yuan per semester. Last year, it rose to forty-five yuan, and this year it has increased by half, reaching eighty or ninety yuan. Books and miscellaneous fees are extra. High school tuition has even exceeded one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>With tuition fees increasing, the prices of books have naturally skyrocketed. The cost of schooling for a child, taking primary school as an example, is almost forty or fifty yuan per semester, including books and miscellaneous fees. With such increases, school authorities may argue that it is due to increased salaries for teachers' union members and various other expenses, but it certainly does not amount to such a large sum. They must also consider the parents of children from wage-earning families. Living in this era, if they cannot afford the enormous tuition fees for their children, they will have to drop out of school. The purpose of running schools is to enthusiastically promote education and enhance national knowledge. Now, running schools as if they were businesses goes against the purpose of running schools. If schools are treated as businesses, know that society will have a few more children who are out of school and can only long for learning and sigh."</p>

<h3 id="e90">Proposal for the Shanghai Municipal Council to Levy a High Tax on Silver Houses <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhao</p>
<p>Anyone who has paid attention to the advertisements in the past six months will have noticed that too many new silver houses have opened this year, to an alarming extent. Optimistically, this is a phenomenon that should exist in Shanghai's abnormal prosperity and speculative development. But thinking further, no one will forget the credit and exchange frenzy of the early Republic of China. At that time, the opening of trust companies and exchanges was no less than today. As a result, a group of them went bankrupt, causing panic in the entire financial community. Afterwards, the concession authorities and even the Chinese officials regretted that they had not taken measures to ban them beforehand and were too laissez-faire. Originally, even the painting of door frames required the formulation of various regulations and restrictions. How much more so should profit-making institutions related to economic organization and its safety? Such speculative businesses should not be left to their own devices. The reason is clear to everyone. Recently, because of the rise of Shuangma (double horse, referring to stocks), several silver houses have already gone bankrupt. Moreover, the international situation is intensifying day by day, and the future is truly unimaginable. Once there is any disturbance, the credit and exchange frenzy of the early Republic of China will inevitably repeat itself today. At that time, Shanghai's problems will not only be the question of who has the right to rule? It will not only be the problem of the livelihood of the citizens? There will also be the problem of the collapse of the entire economic organization. Leaving aside these issues, let's look at the current financial situation of the concession: all we hear about is increasing fees and taxes, but this speculative tax, which is beneficial to finance and has the effect of social policy, is set aside. Someone had already proposed it at the Western taxpayers' meeting this spring, and someone in this journal had also advocated it in the past. Now Mr. Shen has written an article proposing it again. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, and it is happening amidst the Shuangma frenzy and the silver house bankruptcy frenzy, we hope that the concession authorities will pay more attention to it. (Editor)</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, refugees from all over the country have flocked to Shanghai. The large number of residents in Shanghai naturally increased the concentration of capital. Moreover, because of the establishment of the United Reserve Bank of North China in 1938, various trade policies and monetary policies were changed, and a large amount of capital escaped to Shanghai. Furthermore, because the Tianjin concession was threatened in 1939, even more capital from the north escaped to Shanghai. In the autumn of 1939, when the European war broke out, the British Far East colonies implemented economic controls, and the capital of overseas Chinese in those areas also escaped in large quantities. Although Shanghai experienced some capital flight to Hong Kong due to the establishment of the Huaxing Bank and the Central Reserve Bank, and the disturbances of the concession incident, the amount was small. And it soon flowed back, thus creating a place of excessive capital concentration.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Poor Consumption of Collateral <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's transportation with the rest of the country was blocked. Various agricultural and native products in non-war zones could not be transported to Shanghai due to transportation issues or government bans. Those in war zones or guerrilla zones were mostly subject to strict controls. Furthermore, because the original emerging industries in various war zones were destroyed or occupied, most of the concession's raw materials had to rely on imported goods. However, the manufactured goods could not be sold to various parts of the country, so the most important object of capital flow was almost completely isolated. Here, the proper use or investment of capital became a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Loopholes in Capital Blockade <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is an international commercial port, and because the government's power was difficult to reach after the National Army moved west, phenomena such as the black market for exchange rates and the illegal trading of gold appeared. Although the National Government had restrictions on withdrawal orders, prohibitions on exchange rate subsidies, and exchange rate systems to prevent capital flight, they were not effective.</p>
<p>The only investment routes left in the concession were industry and commerce, real estate, and securities, and the scope was narrow. As a result, speculation flourished. Those with short-sightedness did not know that moving to another place was better, but instead used speculative businesses to stir up trouble. They created various schemes to seek quick profits. This is why the war silver industry flourished.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Organization of Silver Houses After the War <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The organizational structure of silver houses is based on the principle of buying and selling on behalf of customers and taking commissions. They are divided into various categories such as raw silk, US dollars, cotton yarn, and government bonds, and rarely engage in deposit and lending matters. For trading on behalf of customers, the margin for ordinary cotton yarn is 200 yuan per bale, and the commission is 80 cents. The margin for raw silk is 200 yuan per tael, and the commission is 1.5 yuan. The margin for US dollars is 50 yuan per hundred, and the commission is 1 yuan. The margin for government bonds is 50 yuan per thousand, and the commission is 50 cents. The silver houses are purely for the purpose of taking commissions, so they are similar to gambling with a cut. It is said that cotton yarn is the most active in trading. From the opening of the market at 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the average daily trading volume per house is 200 bales. Therefore, the commission income from cotton yarn is also considerable. Most of these silver houses are partnerships with capital ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Some rent office space for business, while others set up shops. The sections of Five Horse Road, Sichuan Road, and Avenue Edward VII are the most prosperous. In total, there are more than 400 houses. Recently, a cotton yarn futures market has been established. Its organizational method is the same as that of the raw silk joint exchange, and it is operated in the manner of an exchange. The trading objects are all futures. Now, the organization of the cotton yarn exchange is described as follows: below the cotton yarn exchange are the large yarn houses or silver houses, which are brokers. Below them are the medium houses, which operate attached to the large houses. The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Exchange is the central location for buying and selling on paper. The large houses are brokers who buy and sell on behalf of customers. The medium houses are intermediaries who buy and sell on behalf of customers attached to the large houses. The large houses pay a margin to the cotton yarn exchange, which is responsible for safekeeping by the chairman of the exchange and the members of the safekeeping committee. The medium houses pay a margin to the large houses, which are kept by the large houses. Speculators trade with the large houses, and the margin is paid to the large houses. When trading with the medium houses, the margin is paid to the medium houses, and trading can be carried out.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Indirect Impact of Silver Houses on Prices <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's transportation with the rest of the country has been blocked, and transportation is difficult and often subject to controls. Therefore, goods cannot flow freely, resulting in sluggish sales, as mentioned above. However, speculators do not ask about supply and demand, but seek to temporarily create rumors and raise prices. They hoard as much current goods as possible to gain the benefit of scalping. This creates an artificial supply and demand, causing everything else to rise, layer upon layer. And the final outcome is still on the general public, who are unable to bear the burden. Today, anything that can suppress price increases, regardless of its motive, can be said to be beneficial to the public. Unexpectedly, the financial community in this city does not seek this, but instead uses speculative businesses, vigorously establishing gambling-like silver houses, and greatly facilitating and promoting speculation and hoarding. They create various schemes, fearing that prices will not rise.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Reasons for High Taxation of Silver Houses and Benefits for All Sectors <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Public expenditures are expanding, and revenue is insufficient. In order to ensure the safety of the concession's administration, it is reasonable to increase taxes. However, the authorities should take the principle of taking from the people without harming them and using it for the people as a standard. They must be fair and not allow ordinary people to bear too heavy a burden. Especially at this time and place, ordinary people are finding life increasingly difficult, and their burden should be avoided as much as possible. It is now clear to everyone that ordinary people are unable to pay new taxes. We must know that the reason why residents have the ability to pay taxes is purely because they have a corresponding income. Today, the income of ordinary people in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, while consumption is increasing. Therefore, the authorities must consider the ability of ordinary salaried workers and legitimate businesses to bear the burden of taxes. If this can be prepared, then the final burden, the ultimate burden, will not be placed on the general public, who are haggard, groaning, and unable to bear the burden of life, or are struggling to maintain it, or on legitimate businesses and industries. The silver house industry is a speculative business and is harmful to the residents of this city. And it is also a kind of profit-making business. In any case, it is reasonable to increase taxes. In this way, the residents of this city can enjoy complete social and public services.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Advantages of Collecting Silver House Tax <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>1. Fairness: Residents pay taxes to be used by the authorities. It is always proportional to the strength within each person's possible range. In other words, taxes must be collected according to each person's ability. Those with greater ability bear more, and those with less ability bear less. Today, the salaries or profits earned by salaried workers or formal businesses each month are not enough to cover their living expenses and maintain their business, while silver houses are accidental income, or can be called unearned income. It is unfair for the authorities to levy taxes equally. Therefore, high taxation of silver houses and transaction taxes are fairer in any way.</p>
<p>2. Elasticity: Silver houses are a new type of enterprise after the war, and can also be called a special speculative business after the war. The Shanghai Municipal Council was able to proceed in an orderly manner during peacetime. There were no major changes in the financial budget. Today, the scope of action of the department has expanded in this extraordinary period. And because of currency and other relationships? The need for funding has greatly expanded. Silver houses have become a special industry during wartime, so they are well suited to meet their urgent needs and are a flexible tax.</p>
<p>3. Abundant Revenue: During the war, there were as many as six or seven hundred silver houses established. Taking cotton yarn alone, the average daily transaction volume per house is over two hundred bales. If calculated at a commission of one yuan per bale, then more than one hundred thousand yuan can be obtained per day. If the Shanghai Municipal Council were to donate a quarter of it, then thirty thousand yuan could be obtained per day. If a month is calculated as twenty-two days (excluding holidays), then six or seven hundred thousand yuan could be obtained. Raw silk, government bonds, US dollars, etc. are not included. If such a donation can be levied, it is estimated that eight or nine million yuan in donations can be obtained in the new budget year, and in fact, it is not just this number.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Conclusion <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The silver house in wartime is actually a tool for speculators. And the silver house is a cut-taking business that uses people's speculative profit-seeking psychology, disregarding everything, and only seeking quick profits. The impact is to increase the burden on ordinary people and make it difficult for industry and commerce to prosper. But if we want to solve the problem of prices and reduce the burden on ordinary people based on the current situation, it is indeed impossible. However, although it cannot be completely resolved, we also hope for a partial solution. Generally speaking, taking compensation from the authorities' assistance, at least part of the effectiveness is that if the authorities can levy high silver house donations at this time, the authorities can obtain reasonable funds to benefit the expansion of public expenditures. At the same time, it can indirectly: 1. Suppress prices. 2. Reduce speculation. 3. Transfer purchasing power. 4. Imply a ban on new silver houses by donation.</p>
<p>Some say that high silver house donations conflict with the National Government's income tax and wartime excess profits tax. But do not know that today's silver house organizations are already illegal, and would they be willing to pay this tax?</p>
<p>Some say that silver houses are a high-risk business, so the profits should also be proportional to it. But those who know the inside story know that there is no risk at all. Instead, it is a commission-receiving agency that enjoys the benefits. Therefore, high taxation of silver houses is indeed a win-win situation at present.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Germany's Strategy for "Buying Up" French Assets <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhou Shuhua</p>
<p>The complete occupation of most French industries by Germany is undoubtedly the most organized and large-scale seizure in history. But besides its great quantity, what is most astonishing is that it differs from previous seizures of war booty. Because Germany "legally" paid the price for all occupied objects.</p>
<p>In the armistice agreement, France promised to compensate Germany 400 million francs per day. Converted at the official exchange rate, this huge sum is equivalent to just under 10 million US dollars. It is to maintain the German army in the French occupied zone.</p>
<p>But the cost of maintaining the German army in the French occupied zone is only 115 million francs per day. Therefore, after paying all the expenses of the army in the occupied zone, the German authorities have 175 million francs left over. One of its greatest uses is to buy French industries. By the end of this great shame, Germany hopes to legally control all of France's heavy industry, printing industry, and radio.</p>
<p>Outside of France, all French industries throughout Europe have been bought up by Germany. This includes the Skoda arms factory in Czechoslovakia and the largest copper mine in Europe, the Bor copper mine in Yugoslavia. The transfer of the Bor copper mine was agreed upon in Paris last winter by Laval, Ribbentrop, and Abetz before he was ousted in December. When General Petain heard this news, it is said that he said, "Laval is selling France piece by piece."</p>
<p>France's heavy industry (mostly in the south) and publishing industry have also been bought in large quantities. In the French occupied zone, most newspapers are partially or completely controlled by the Germans.</p>
<p>The Germans are doing their best to buy up Havas. Therefore, this French news agency and the nationally exclusive advertising agency had to be reorganized to avoid being completely taken over by the Germans. After this reorganization, Havas transferred all the rights to this wealthy exclusive advertising agency to Germany, but retained the real power of the news agency.</p>
<p>Hachette's, the largest printing and distribution trust, refused the German takeover. The Germans are particularly eager to control this company, because they hope to be able to manage the publication of school textbooks.</p>
<p>Because Hachette's refused the German takeover, it was greatly attacked by the Paris "Evening News" and other papers in Paris controlled by the Germans. They attacked Hachette's in every possible way, and the baseness of the words was simply unimaginable. These attacks were continuous.</p>
<p>This company will inevitably have to give in, although it has great resources. It has no guarantee and if the newspaper attacks are not effective, they will implement "investigations" and other means to force the company to submit.</p>
<p>If possible, the Germans always use milder means to solve all problems. Sometimes, they are willing to pay a higher price than the market price. Sometimes, when the factory owners are unwilling to sell to the Germans, the Germans hire French puppets to buy them. When these methods are not effective, they will release mild hints: "You can sell now or sell as soon as possible, otherwise your property may be confiscated."</p>
<p>Recently, the Paris'Oeuvre published the following notice:</p>
<p>"The board of directors of the French Bor Copper Mine Company hereby informs all shareholders that a German group intends to purchase the company's shares and manage all the company's business. This matter was expressly declared by the Minister of Finance on December 9, 1940. Regardless of the type of stock...the price is 3,500 francs per share. The sale of shares is voluntary...but this board of directors sincerely advises all shareholders to do it as soon as possible." Although there is no strong intention, no one will fail to understand its meaning.</p>
<p>Recently, the Vichy government enacted laws prohibiting French domestic and foreign legal persons from transferring property to people of other countries. If this law can be implemented, it will ease the trend of French industry being seized. But it cannot prevent the sale of private industries, because these types of stocks are not registered in the market. Many French heavy industries have been acquired by the Germans in this way. In the week that the decree was passed, a privately owned yarn factory in Lorraine was sold for 30 million francs.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Issues Concerning the Reconstruction of County and Township Finance - Continued from Issue 374 <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Li Bingyi</p>
<p>In its resolution, the business scope of county and township banks is prescribed as follows: (1) Re-mortgage, re-discount, or guaranteed credit loans. (2) Remittance connections. (3) Accepting deposits. (4) Acting as an agent for collection and disbursement. (5) Acting as an agent for issuing public bonds or corporate bonds. (6) Safekeeping of valuables or securities. (7) Savings business. In addition, they may issue agricultural and industrial bonds, but the total amount shall not exceed five times the paid-up capital, and it must be submitted for approval before implementation, which can be said to be quite cautious.</p>
<p>From the above-prescribed business scope, we can see that the central county and township banks, after handling re-mortgage and re-discount for various counties and townships, can prevent local areas from restricting lending due to capital turnover limitations. The issuance of agricultural and industrial bonds can solidify long-term credit into negotiable instruments, increasing general public confidence in investing in local production enterprises. However, in the initial stages of implementation, the government should provide interest subsidies to facilitate issuance. As for inter-county connections, in addition to remittance connections and acting as agents for collection and disbursement, if there are large-scale local special production enterprises, the central government should directly organize and guide joint lending, which would be much more dynamic and effective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the general principles of county and township lending business, not only should efforts be made to achieve regional universality, but also attention should be paid to the actual development of local agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the standards for lending ratios should be determined separately. While agriculture is undoubtedly important in local production enterprises, the small-scale industries processing agricultural products or other local specialties, family handicrafts, and local transportation and distribution commercial sectors cannot be ignored. In the current era of exchange economics, agriculture, industry, and commerce are all important links in the production sector and should not be neglected. Efforts should be made to achieve universal and balanced development to prevent goods from being stockpiled in rural areas, merchants from being trapped in cities, and various adverse phenomena caused by the stagnation of distribution mechanisms. In addition, the targets of lending must be accurate, ensuring that every penny of funds lent is indeed used in the production process of producers and is not used by others as a tool for exploiting interest gains. As for the amount of the loan and the duration, the actual needs of the loan's purpose should be the standard. Excessive amounts easily waste the use of funds, and if the duration is too short or the loan is too small, it is feared that despite having the name of a loan, there will ultimately be little practical benefit.</p>
<p>Banking business emphasizes both creditworthiness and lending, and what constitutes the majority of bank funds is not the bank's capital or reserve funds, but external deposits. Therefore, the development of county and township finance must first encourage savings, absorb as much scattered deposits as possible, and strive to utilize local dormant funds and transform private funds into bank deposits for use in production enterprises.</p>
<p>Regarding the management of operations, there are countless details, but I personally believe that two points are very important. First, the habit of using new-style financial institutions should be gradually cultivated among the general public. Procedures must be simple, time should be saved, and employees should be responsible for providing guidance at any time. Second, in addition to lending, there should be obligations to guide, advise, and supervise local industries regarding industrial technology and production processes, so that production technology can have opportunities for gradual improvement. However, employees should have special technical training. At the beginning of establishment, requiring outstanding operating results, the plan for nurturing talents for a century cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In summary, the issue of county and township financial reconstruction is not only a necessary measure to increase wartime materials, but also the foundation of our national economic construction. The importance of the mission and the arduousness of the tasks undertaken by county and township banks are undeniable. However, the completion of county and township financial reconstruction also requires the joint cooperation of county and township personnel, which is inevitable. (The End)</p>

<p>— Zhou Zhifeng</p>
<p>All female workers engaged in weaving undergo political training. Since the warp density of the waterproof fabric is high and the weft count is numerous (the work for female workers is much more difficult than for ordinary fabrics), when weaving, thread breaks or uneven yarn are often found, which must be removed with skilled techniques to avoid affecting future dyeing and sizing processes. After weaving, it is inspected and sent to the dyeing factory for dyeing (You Sheng factory's own dyeing department specializes in dyeing yarn and does not dye fabrics). After dyeing, it is sent back to the factory, where specialized technicians apply waterproof sizing. This process is extremely important. The waterproof effect requires: (1) the fabric to be firm and tough; (2) the fabric's structure to be special with correct diagonals; (3) the sizing to be perfect; (4) the chemicals used to be of high quality and properly mixed. Therefore, this work cannot be competently performed by anyone other than the manager and chief engineers. The factory has been researching the sizing process for many years, constantly improving it. Water resistance has been extended from 24 hours to 36 hours and is now achieving 72 hours. After sizing and drying, perfect waterproof fabric is produced. You Sheng Factory was founded by alumni of the Textile Department of Nantong University. Most of the persons in charge have worked in major textile and dyeing factories for many years and each has expertise in chemical dyeing and textile technology. The factory is still carefully researching to make the Golden Bear brand waterproof fabric achieve 100 hours of water resistance. Once the experiment is successful, it can be manufactured in large quantities, expanding from 500 yards to 2,000 yards per day. At that time, it will not only meet domestic demand but also be able to compete in the Southeast Asian market. In places such as Batavia and the East Indies, it rains for five or six days continuously during the rainy season, so raincoats that are not waterproof for dozens of hours cannot sell well in Southeast Asia. Only the products of You Sheng Factory have this long-term hope, which is also the glory of national goods. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Application of Color in Venues, Pavilions, and Factories <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>Dyeing and weaving are related to clothing, cooking is related to food, repelling heat and flies is related to housing, and inspecting machinery is related to transportation...</p>
<p>The latest inventions in the scientific field of color application in Western countries are full of ingenious ideas, which are directly applied to factories and venues, and indirectly benefit clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Here, I have summarized the strengths of various schools and listed the main points as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Colors are divided into warm and cool: If the interior decoration of a house is entirely red, the occupants will feel very hot. If red is not used and the entire room is decorated in blue, people will feel very cool. This perception of cold and heat varies with the color. This is true for humans, and it is also true for flies (mosquitoes like to be near dark colors). Flies are afraid of cold, so in kitchens where cooking is done, blue tiles are used, and flies do not want to stay long and leave quickly.</p>
<p>(2) Color affects work efficiency: In machine rooms with excessive manpower, if the walls are painted blue, the workers will feel slightly cooler inside. Blacksmiths working under blue light achieve better results.</p>
<p>(3) A bright and clean new life: New-style housing has a simple structure and is bright throughout the room, matched with lightly yellow or light green furniture without decoration. Even a little dust is easily noticed, making it easy to develop a habit of cleanliness.</p>
<p>(4) Neutral light for identifying colors: It is not easy to obtain accurate colors under artificial light. However, the colors seen by everyone under sunlight are not entirely accurate either. Dr. Tschermak, a famous physics professor from Prague, Czech Republic, recently invented the "Neutral-Lichtlampe," which makes the color-identifying light pass through many light filters. Using this lamp to identify colors is accurate to the smallest detail, and the colors it uses for determination are even more accurate than daylight. This lamp has a wide range of uses in dyeing, weaving, printing, and other factories.</p>
<p>(5) Hang blue curtains to select yellow pearls: After looking at various colors for a long time, people's eyes become fatigued. Workers in artificial pearl factories are constantly exposed to scarlet (bright red) and coral red (red with a hint of yellow), and often make many mistakes due to eye fatigue. It is best to add a slightly blue light to the room to make the difference between these two red colors more apparent and reduce eye fatigue. If it is a studio where yellow is selected all day long, blue curtains should be hung high on the walls so that everyone feels the atmosphere is tinged with blue light due to the reflection of blue light.</p>
<p>(6) Lamps with shades enhance reflection: Using colored lights at night to identify colorful drawings or items can also make the difference between similar colors stronger, thereby reducing eye fatigue.</p>
<p>(7) Dark corners are beneficial for restoring correct vision: If someone has free time to stay quietly in a dark room, open their eyes, and let them be cleansed by darkness (this is called bathing in darkness, which is the opposite of naked body exposure to sunlight, called "sunbathing"), and then go out into the sunlight, then their vision will be temporarily clear and fresh, and it will be very accurate to use it to identify colors.</p>
<p>(8) Cake shops and restaurants have the beauty of "not having it both ways": When food changes from raw to cooked, cooks often have a habit of silently measuring the depth of cooking and the degree of heat by changing the color. However, if the room lights are too bright, suddenly making the color difference between slightly焦 and un焦 stronger, or even misidentifying the un焦 color as slightly焦, the food is often taken out hurriedly when it is only half-cooked. This is a common dispute encountered by cake shops and restaurants, which is the opposite of the weakness of color difference in artificial pearl factories. However, both the missed opportunity and the misjudgment are the same mistake. Recently, people have tried to find a way to remedy it, saying that the walls next to the stove should be painted in advance to the color of焦 yellow that is just right for the degree of heat.</p>
<p>(9) Color identification can detect weaknesses inside machines: The internal components of machines often cannot be measured in detail with a "thermometer" due to the speed of rotation or the pressure is too strong, resulting in high or low temperatures during operation. A new method is to brush on a paint that easily changes color due to high heat. Take a look at it while the heat is rising, so you can know which parts inside the machine are the hottest and which are too hot, and thereby detect where the weaknesses are in the entire machine. This is also an amazing achievement that the predecessors did not expect.</p>

<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>This summer's popular women's clothing material is a wool and linen interwoven color horizontal stripe palicos. At first glance, this fabric is soft and comfortable, as if it is very elegant. But upon closer inspection, its coarseness is actually no less than that of burlap. However, this fabric has a beautiful reputation as an "imported product" and a noble price of seventy or eighty yuan per qipao.</p>
<p>In fact, Shen Fang, a domestic silk mill, also has two new products of summer clothing material: one is a color horizontal stripe raw silk fabric similar to the aforementioned palicos. It is a women's clothing material. Both the warp and weft are made of natural silk. The warp is pure white and the weft is woven with colored silk. The width is one foot five inches, which happens to match the use of qipao. Because it is raw silk fabric, the texture is relatively stiff, but transparent and light, no less than ordinary raw silk or gauze. The material cost of each qipao is only seven or eight yuan, and its low price in domestic silk can be said to be unmatched. Even though its toughness is relatively weak, ordinary women only wear summer qipao for going out, so it is very suitable and economical. Moreover, it is only once a year, right?</p>
<p>The other product is a completely factory silk electric weaving spun silk, with a width of two feet two inches. The warp and weft are woven with high-quality factory silk, so the silk surface is smooth and clean, and the body is relatively heavy, each foot weighs more than seven or eight cents, which is very suitable for tailoring men's long gowns or shirts. The advantage of this factory silk spun silk is that it is washable and durable, the color becomes brighter and cleaner after washing, and the body becomes tighter after washing. Compared with the earlier bright silk and imported Indian silk and other fabrics, it is not the same. Moreover, the price is also very cheap. Silk shops sell it for about four yuan per foot, but buying it directly from Shen Zhou Zhuang is only 120-130 yuan per piece of 4.6 zhang, which is only 2.7-2.8 yuan per foot, which is still relatively cheap compared to other silk fabrics.</p>

<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>This publication has published many articles on the discussion of soy sauce and stomach diseases. The author is ashamed of not having this experience and dare not talk about it. The following is a brief description of several points on preventing soy sauce from molding and its use, to contribute to readers.</p>
<p>Although soy sauce is an important ingredient for cooking, its usage should be determined by the dishes being cooked. Generally, red-braised fish and meat should be used more, but clear stewed and cured dishes should not be added with soy sauce. For dishes such as toon mixed with tofu, it is better not to add soy sauce. However, recently the weather has entered the moldy season, and soy sauce is prone to mold (i.e., white flowers appear). To avoid this, the soy sauce can be boiled in a pot first, and after it cools down, pour it into a bottle. The bottle stopper should be tightened, but the bottle must be wiped clean first and no water droplets should be left, so it will not mold even after long storage.</p>
<p>In addition to seasoning, soy sauce can relieve drunkenness and relieve pain. For those who are drunk, brew strong soy sauce soup and drink it to relieve it. Also, when the skin is scalded by boiling water or fire and has not ruptured, apply soy sauce to the affected area to relieve the pain. However, if the face has recently recovered from sores, you cannot dip food in raw soy sauce, otherwise black spots will appear and damage the appearance. These are small common sense tips for eating soy sauce.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>There are two types of beans that have been on the market recently, one is edamame, and the other is cowpea. Edamame is four or five cents per two, and cowpea is three or four cents per two. Of course, these prices are not cheap. However, whether it is meat or vegetarian dishes, what is cheap these days? Beans are rich in vitamins, and eating some every day is very beneficial. Edamame can be used as a supplement to various meat and vegetarian dishes. In addition, for meat dishes, it can be braised with pork or beef. For vegetarian dishes, you can coat the shells with batter and red-braise them. Both are great dishes to serve with rice. For cowpea meat dishes, you can stir-fry them with shredded meat or sliced meat. For vegetarian dishes, you only need to add some fried dough sticks and dried shredded tofu and stir-fry them.</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Books are records of human knowledge. Old historical sites and new inventions all require systematic descriptions to be found in books. However, books themselves are not only the main food of knowledge, but also a kind of pastime to regulate the spirit. Isn't it possible to get endless fun by holding a volume in hand in leisure?</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply feel that every family must have a considerable number of books, prepared for the whole family to use for leisure time, and to increase knowledge and wisdom invisibly. In our daily progress, we should spend some on books - a daily newspaper, several magazines and pictorials. In addition to this, reference books such as dictionaries, daily encyclopedias, medicine and health, cooking, sewing, etc. are also indispensable. As for families with children, it is even more necessary to add several children's books to develop children's habits of reading books.</p>
<p>Each purchase of books does not need to buy too much, you should estimate the amount of leisure time to determine the number to buy. Otherwise, if there are more books and less leisure time, and the reading is not finished, it will often cause boredom or even give up on them. But if there are fewer books and more leisure time, then improper entertainment will take advantage of this gap and seduce us. This point naturally requires a reading ability test before you can buy the appropriate amount of books in the bookstore.</p>
<p>The placement of books is also an important issue. If they are displayed properly, it will of course help the decoration of the house. Otherwise, if they are scattered in pieces, one in the east and one in the west, it will hinder the appearance and violate the condition of "cleanliness". Now, the place where we place books does not necessarily have to have bookshelves and bookcases, as long as they are placed in a suitable and easy-to-access place.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Morality of Walking <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Yiming</p>
<p>Walking is a very common thing, so people in general have always paid no attention to walking, whether it is hygiene, safety, morality, etc., especially no attention to the morality of walking.</p>
<p>We often see some people walking, running around like a race, never considering the safety of the old, the weak and women, so accidents of being knocked down and trampled on can often happen, and some people do the opposite, looking around on the road, pacing, and even hand-in-hand in a row (especially women), so that no matter what important things people have, they can only patiently let them go. Also, when it rains, people with umbrellas always walk close to the roots of the wall, while those with bare bodies are squeezed onto the road to rain. Also, when someone carrying heavy objects walks in front or behind (in fact, the most people carrying heavy objects are coolies and apprentices, who should be sympathized with), the ones with empty hands (also the most intellectuals) not only do not show sympathy and give way, but also put on a serious face and reprimand others for bumping into them.</p>
<p>Similar contradictory facts tell us that the general public's moral concepts are really too underestimated. In other words, it is that the general public still does not understand the meaning of morality, and it needs to be used at any time and place, and can be expressed in any action. Therefore, when walking, in addition to paying attention to walking and safety, it is also necessary to pay attention to morality.</p>

<p>— Yang Yan</p>
<p>The Jinshi Zhong advanced in the clouds.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he pressed down on the cloud head, sniffed deeply into the air with his nose, eh! Such a dense ghostly aura. He felt a little strange, but also a little happy. He touched his stomach, imagining a rich breakfast in his mind, so he urged the cloud head and chased directly after the ghostly smell.</p>
<p>"Immortal, please slow down!" A voice stopped him. He turned around and saw a person wearing strange clothes. "Who are you!" Zhong Kui asked strangely. "Little god is the local earth god." The person in strange clothes replied respectfully.</p>
<p>"Oh! But your clothes?..." Zhong Kui scratched his messy hair and asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>"This is a suit, because this is a concession, so little god has to wear a suit." The earth god explained respectfully again.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Zhong Kui responded casually, his mind only on the many ghosts, so he immediately shifted the topic to this: "Why are there so many ghosts here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"This... this..." The earth god couldn't answer for a moment.</p>
<p>"What kind of ghosts are they?"</p>
<p>"There are many kinds of ghosts, there are lustful ghosts, pale-faced ghosts, gambling ghosts, and hoarding ghosts..."</p>
<p>"What! Hoarding ghosts?" Although Zhong Kui had captured many ghosts, he had never heard of this name before.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is a newly emerged ghost. This kind of ghost specializes in hiding things that humans use daily, causing people to starve to death and freeze to death."</p>
<p>"Humph! Such hateful ghosts." Zhong Kui angrily stroked the curly beard under his chin, and a terrifying light radiated from his big eyes. "Good! Let me go and wipe them out completely!"</p>
<p>"Wait, Immortal! You will definitely suffer if you go alone." The suit-wearing earth god shouted in horror.</p>
<p>Zhong Kui pressed down on the cloud head: "Nonsense, don't you know that I am Zhong Kui, who specializes in devouring ghosts?"</p>
<p>"No, Immortal, I know. But there are indeed many ghosts. They are in contact with each other, are good at creating "ghost walls," and are sometimes not afraid of the city god. They also have money and power. Moreover, they have long anticipated that the Immortal is coming and have already prepared a plan to deal with it."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Zhong Kui also felt a little tricky: "Then what should I do?"</p>

<p>"No, let them laugh! Won't people laugh if their own father is dressed so raggedly?" Although Mei Bao was only a twelve-year-old child, she already spoke very cleverly. "The other day Mr. Gu asked me: "Wu Meiying, is the one who picks you up every day hired by your family?" Dad, do you think I feel good about it?"</p>
<p>But no matter how Mei Bao persuaded him, Qiu Haitang was still reluctant to spend a penny for himself, because he basically only had very little money left; he wanted to use all of this limited money to cultivate his beloved daughter.</p>
<p>He smiled at Little Gouzi, then unflinchingly held up the umbrella and walked towards the east of the town in the heavy rain along the stone road.</p>
<p>Spring rain in the north was already a very rare thing, and today's rain was particularly heavy; at the same time, the wind was also very strong, carrying strands of rain like noodles, sweeping straight from the northeast, although Qiu Haitang had an umbrella in his hand, his body was still inevitably wetted by the rain in several places.</p>
<p>From the second month after Wu Da returned to Li Village from Beiping, Qiu Haitang moved to Zhangshu Village with Mei Bao and Zhang Xiaogouzi; because this was Zhang Xiaogouzi's hometown, they were able to easily buy two small houses and four or five acres of barren land to live in.</p>
<p>He not only sent away Wang Si's family, but also sold all the fields and houses that were originally in Li Village. He told Grandpa Wu that he was going to Jinan to find a friend to do some business together.</p>
<p>"That's good! As the saying goes, sitting and eating will empty the mountain, you should go out and make a living!" Grandpa Wu did not object either. In fact, Qiu Haitang's house was sold by him; and he knew very well that the silver that Qiu Haitang had saved in Beiping had all been lost, and he really had very little left in his hand. There would not necessarily be many benefits to continuing to live with him, so it would be better for everyone to separate earlier. (145)</p>

<p>— Yaoting</p>
<p>After this heavy rain, many places with lower terrain were still covered with water.</p>
<p>On ×× Road, the water accumulated quite deeply. In the water, there was a group of homeless children, who could be called "sea heroes" on land. When every rickshaw passed by, as long as the passenger was a modern girl, they would rush up to carry out their work.</p>
<p>"Take out the corner tickets!"</p>
<p>"If you don't take them out, we'll splash water!" When the passenger on the rickshaw showed surprise or a little difficulty, it was followed by a warning.</p>
<p>Then corner tickets one by one... fell into their hands, and the rickshaw could pass safely.</p>
<p>"Sea heroes" on land! Should they do this?</p>

<p>"Rickshaw! How much to Carter Road!"</p>
<p>"No exaggeration, one and a half dollars."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, usually it only costs twenty cents on a normal day."</p>
<p>"Sir, it's raining heavily, and we have to fill our stomachs!"</p>
<p>"Alas! The weather is not good!" Little Sanzi's mother sighed.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm hungry," Little beggar Sanzi pulled at his mother's clothes.</p>
<p>"Good child, don't you see it's raining? And there are so few pedestrians!" Mother turned around, the newspaper on her body was wet with rain and stuck tightly to her body, and a few sparse pieces of rotten grass fell off.</p>
<p>Vegetable Market</p>
<p>A Jin thought: "It's raining today, so vegetables will definitely be expensive! Reporting more to the Tai Tai will definitely not be suspected."</p>
<p>"Hey! How much is a catty of baby bok choy!"</p>
<p>"Three corners!"</p>

<p>"The mountain rain is coming, and the wind is filling the building." The Old Master paced back and forth, humming like a refined person. In fact, he didn't understand the meaning of this sentence, but he heard Lao Song saying it in the stock exchange to describe speculation.</p>
<p>"If you're not going out, let's play eight rounds." Fifth Concubine joined in the fun.</p>

<p>In the mansion of a certain great lawyer, there are three pug dogs, who are fed meat and high-quality white rice every day, and are also bathed with medicinal soap.
