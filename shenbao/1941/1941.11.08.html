<h3>中英蘇聯悲壯立場　美洲決予全力援助　羅斯福對國際勞工會演說　鼓勵各代表奮門爭取自由</h3>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　羅斯福（見圖）總統昨夜在此對國際勞工局大會演說、重申美國極力援助中·英·蘇之決心、略謂、國際勞工局現經過多年試騐、始終進行縮减工時、保護農工業女工童工、使海員生活舒適及使工廠礦工爲人類工作適宜塲所之任務、今諸君經世界戰爭之變亂、時逾兩載、雖以希特勒之淫威驅、君等離其在日內瓦永遠辦公地點、但因吾等友人韋南特（前勞工局理事後任美駐英大使）之努力、得在此繼續行使其職務、君等準備於他日世界戰爭結束時、在製定永久和平所擊的社會政策之工作中盡其責任、吾人奮鬥之要素在使人人自由、苟無聞明的社會政策、則不能有平民之眞正自由、在最後分析中、民治國今日所爭者、即此開明的社會政策耳、君等所關切者、亦即各民治國人民所關切者、以許多委員國言、其參加國際勞工局也、已成重大之犧牲、然呻吟於最後獨裁者下之國家、其代表仍在此忠貞與會、此為國際勞工局活潑有生氣之最大證擄、故余對此代表　觀迎、若干國努工　體領袖、今日有因敢維護文化非此不能存在之主義、致憔悴於集中營者、余對此勞工團體之代表願伸手鼓勵之、君等有來自殘破地方者、美國願告其人民曰、「汝等未被忘却」、美國現努力援助反抗侵略之國家、如威士康卒州之工人向以制造鋁器為業者、今已犧牲其業、俾吾人可造飛機援助英·蘇·中三國、役於各處工廠之多數橡皮工人、亦犠牲立即就役之機會、俾船隻得運飛機與坦克車分往利物浦、阿堪遮與仰光、而數十萬之汽車工人、亦改操他種工役、庶用於汽車之鋼、得爲美國工廠製造刺希特勒之利器等是也、</p>
<p>美國人民決不放棄　加入共同防務利</p>
<p>雖然吾人在美國尙未作任何切實犧牲、吾人並未如英國之勇壯人民受天空轟炸、且亦未能想及中國人民在其反抗侵略爭取自由的　鬥中所作犧牲之程度、吾人已在驚奇中親覩俄人在過去四個月中以無數屍骨與一片焦土的代價、反抗納粹之戰　機梆、而歐洲一般男女自挪威至希臘、反抗暴力之掙扎、尤可歌可泣、暴力雖强、終不足以摧毀爭取自由之奪鬭、就美國人民而言、此種奮　決不使之無效、中·英·蘇之悲壯的立塲、將受美洲自由人民之完全援助、我國人民決不放棄其加入共同防務之權利也、美國雖仍有若干實業家與勞工領袖、將其私人利益、置於國家幸福之上、有少數人將其彼此互爭之些微勝利、置於對希特勒的大勝利之上、亦有若干人將其營業利益、置於國防義務之上、更有若干人用其所謂楚經濟政策、強令人接受其要求、而故意延緩國防用品之出產、然此輩僅屬極少數、並不代表美國勞資兩界之全體、美國人民已作必使世界自由之無限制的擔負、無論個人與團體、必不容違此擔負、保衛民治國即所以保衛自己、此義美國工人知之、無待贅言、諸君來自歐洲淪陷國與中國者、已向大會詳言諸君如何奮　及慘淡經營、而一致的社會進步如何爲野蠻人所摧殘之事實矣、</p>
<p>喚起工人加緊生產　日以出品運送戰場</p>
<p>德國將其自己工人編入軍隊、遣往前敵、以應其全向戰爭、之需要後、爲補充人力起見、已將外國平民之勞動家約二百萬人運入國內、蓋納粹已將佔領區地作供其使用之奴隸出產塲、而柏林已成世界最大奴市矣、希特勒如獲勝、則美國工人與其自由勞工組織之命運將如何、美國工人對此毫無疑問、深知其自己之自由與美國人民之安全、在此四分之三爲奴　、四分之一為自由人之世界中、莫可保障、且知吾人必須以軍械供應英·蘇·中三國、尤必須於今日為之、蓋吾人在納粹統治世界的計劃中之地位、即姜個西半球之地位、已標註於納粹時間表上矣、吾人今所須選擇者、為吾人現應作完全之犧牲、積極生產、日日以吾人出品解送全世界之戰塲　、抑吾人應以現有軍火生產率為滿足、延不速作眞正犧牲、如法國人民前所為者、致將來追悔無及歟、前者為現責主義之選擇、即每天工作三班、每日每夜積極運轉其所有機器、工作不　趕造各物是、後者則為　者與自信尙可與希特勒往來之愚迷者之途徑、惟在求勝利而工作、而奮鬭之過程中、吾人必不可忘却最後目的實不僅爲勝利、希特勒主義之打倒、固屬必要、非此則無自由、但若吾人目前不爲將來準備、則此次戰爭、將亦如上次戰爭、徒產生破壞而已、</p>
<p>世界經濟已被擾亂　治本辦法端賴合作</p>
<p>吾人現爲吾人所欲造的更好世界籌劃、如將來世界爲和平可存在之世界、則必使各國庶有更豐浴之生活而後可，今世界中未有衣食住充分供給者、不知有若干億兆人民、世界中自由人民苟擔任為此億兆人民供給一種適當生活標準，則可使覔取工作之全體男女、獲有工作之全體男女獲有工作，吾人現已着手研究世界在戰後之立即需要、因世界經濟已爲戰爭所擾亂矣、吾人擬成就治本辦法、即襄助成立更穩健的生活是、逮此目的其事非易、有得於各國在經濟範圍中極完全之合作（引大西洋憲章中語）、吾人深知、社會問題與經濟問題、在國際範圍中、亦猶在國家範圍中、非各別而不相通者、在國際事件中亦猶在國家事件中，經濟政策不復能僅以經濟爲限、經濟政策者不過爲達到社會目的之一種方法、戰後世界中決不容有個人或國家特殊利益之餘地云、總統言至此、復引大西洋憲章中關於通商與採置原料之平等需要、繼謂、國際勞工局以其勞資雙方之代表、與其技術上知識與經騐、將在籌劃此種國際行動中、成爲謀致和平之極有價値的工具、君等組織將在爲各處人民造成隱定的社會公道之國際制度之工作中、負有重大任務、美國人民決計積極應付此機會、而負起此種歷史上責任云、</p>
<p>稱讚中國反抗侵略　對日顯示強硬態度</p>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　據此間觀察家之意見、羅斯福總統對國際勞工局代表而發之言論、其中有若干節、似對於日本含有特殊意義、當美、日談話在此進行之際、總統於指出侵略國並加以譴責時、從未言及日本、但總統昨在其言論中、特別言及中國數次、稱讚其反抗侵略爭取自由之奮鬥、並允積極援助中國、此似爲美國對於日本所發美國應承認日本勝利與日本爲太平洋霸主的建議之答覆、</p>
<p>合衆社七日倫敦電　昨日此間消息靈通界認爲、羅斯福總統在紐的對國際勞工會代表之演說、乃「美國態度之歡慰、即實際之闡明」、該方面人士對於羅總統堅稱傾力援助中、英、蘇之急需、尤感喜悅、政界對於羅斯福總統將中國之軍火接濟與英國及蘇聯一同提出、深感興趣、渠等認此乃美國將在美、日談話中繼續其强硬之態度之表示、</p>

<p>河內　日方生力軍已抵海防、其中雖有若干現乘火車南開、但大多數仍留東京區、日軍北犯雖非不可能、然就中越間有高山深峽極難通行一點着想、可知東克區日軍「純係防禦性質」一說、不無理由、且四年來戰爭中、已證明華軍在此種山岳地帶、有阻止日軍前進之能力、此點亦足使日軍未敢輕進、據此間最近消息觀之、緬甸公路之運輸能力、現將達最高峯、日方或欲在緬甸公路運華物料、足以補償蘇方停供之物料以前、即阻斷緬甸公路之交通、若干人士聲稱、日方如欲在泰國平原上作戰、必需用大車、而向北活動於山岳地帶、則因運輸與給養困難、用兵必少、惟日方或認其軍力已足敷軍事需要也、大約日本或仍不欲取最後一步、而引起　東戰事之總爆發、無疑的、日方頗有截斷中國境內滇緬公路之意云、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>塔斯社七日莫斯科電　國防委會主席斯達林十一月六日在莫斯科城勞動代表蘇維埃黨機關及公共會社舉行之社會主義十月革命二十四屆紀念慶祝會中發表演講、原詞如下、「諸位同志、社會主義十月革命成功及吾國建立蘇維埃政體後、業於二十四載於茲、目前吾人已進入蘇維埃政體二十五年之初、往年在十月革命紀念建設成就、良以此種成就不特逐年增進、且已月月滋長也、至於此等成就究爲何物、以及其偉大性之何在、各方人仕不論敵友均可知之、但去年除爲和平建設工作年外、亦爲對背信侵犯吾國之德國戰爭年、去年吾人僅能於上半年內從事和平建設活動、下半年的有四閱半月係在對德猛烈戰爭下渡過、此次戰爭已成爲吾國發展之轉捩點、吾人之和平建設工作業已銳减、在若干方面且因戰爭而全部中止、吾人因此被迫重新組織各項工作、使其符合戰爭之需要、吾人已易爲効勞前方及吾紅軍海軍之龐大後力、和平建設階段已告終結、對德侵略者自由戰爭階段業已起始、因此目前吾人應自問、去年下半年或四閱半月內戰爭之結果如何、同時何者爲吾人在此解放戰爭中所應負之任務、關於過去四月內之戰爭歷程、本人在戰爭初期某次演講中、已曾明言危險已在威脅吾國、吾人必須明瞭此點而重組各項工作、籍以符合戰爭之需要、目前在計算四個月戰果之際、本人必須指出此等威脅不特未减弱且已增大、敵人巳佔領一大部份烏克蘭·白俄羅斯·莫達維亞·立陶宛·利特蘭·愛沙尼亞及其他區域、敵已突入唐納資盆地、正在威脅列寗格勒及吾人之光榮首都莫斯科、德法西　侵略者吸在刦掠吾國、並毀壞吾勞動大衆農民及文化份子合力建成之村鎮、而吾海陸軍戰士保衛祖國之榮譽及自由、使敵流血成渠、彼等果敢擊退敵之猛攻、屢建英勇戰積但敵人不顧損失不惜兵士之血、仍在不斷以生力軍驅至前方塡補陣亡兵士、以全力作孤注之一擲、期望於嚴寒來臨前征服列寗格勒及莫斯科、蓋彼深知冬季必不利於彼也、</p>
<p>四閱月中偉大戰果　德軍傷亡逾四百萬　　在四個月戰事中、吾方死者三十五萬、失蹤者三七八·〇〇〇人、傷者一百零二萬人、同期內敵方死傷及失蹤達四百五十萬人、無疑的、經過四閱月之戰事後、德之後備人力降低率、較蘇聯更爲劇烈、當其進攻吾國之初、德法西斯侵略以爲可在一個半至兩個月內「結束」蘇聯、並在此短期內抵達烏拉爾、德方並不諱言其對蘇之「閃電勝利」計劃、、目前此種瘋在計劃必須被認爲完全失敗、在西歐無往而不利之「閃電戰」、在東綫已吿崩潰、其故安在、同時德法西斯軍略家自稱可在兩個月內「結束」蘇聯抵達烏拉爾、果叉何所根據、彼等之估計首先係基於成立反蘇聯盟及誘脅英美加入之夢想、其方法係事先以「革命魔鬼」恫嚇各該國統治者使其不敢與蘇接近而陷蘇聯於孤立、德方善於利用各國各階級間之矛盾以及各國與蘇聯之矛盾、彼等深知此項政策已在法國獲得效果、良以法統治者已爲革命魔鬼」所嚇退、而甘將祖國置於希特勒之鐵蹄下也、德法西斯軍略家以爲必可以同樣仗倆施諸英美兩國、</p>
<p>英美蘇建聯合陣綫　離間策略心勞日拙　　赫斯被德政法西斯遺至英國、目的在誘脅英政治家參加對蘇作戰、然德之估計已完全錯誤、赫斯雖已盡其所能、但英美不特未與法西斯侵略者携手攻蘇、且已與吾人聯台一致對付希特勒德國、同時蘇聯非特並未孤立、且已獲得英美及其他被德佔領區內若干國家之盟友、事實上德方利用他人矛盾等政策已黔驢技窮、完全不適合新的形勢、不特此也、此種政策已使德侵略者陷於危境、在目前由戰爭所造成之新局勢下、該項政策所獲結果、必與其所期望者相反、其次德方之不穩、以爲紅軍一旦受重創後、工農即將衡突、各地發生變亂、全國瓦解、因而協助德方順利抵達烏拉爾、然則在此方面德方亦已估計錯誤矣、紅軍所遭遇之逆璄非特未减弱、且已增强蘇聯人民之團結、不特此也、彼等已將全蘇各民族易爲一不可毀減之軍營援助紅軍及紅色海軍作戰、</p>
<p>蘇聯爲正義而作戰　全國軍民團結鞏固　　蘇聯後方從未有目前之穩固、苟易以其他國家、則在遭遇領土損失後、大有無法支持而歸消滅之可能、蘇維埃制度旣能經歷如此重大之試騐、且已使其後方更臻穩固、則此種制度顯係最穩固之制度、最後、德侵略者過份信任紅軍及海軍之弱點、以爲德海陸軍必可一舉而擊散紅軍、直入吾國內地、然則在此方面、敵亦已計算錯誤、彼等將本身　　估計過高一對於吾海陸軍力量則佔計太低、無疑的吾海陸軍經歷尙少、彼等作戰僅四閱月、而敵人則已作戰兩年、雖然吾軍之士氣則高於德軍、良以彼等係保衛祖國並爲正義而戰也、德方係進付侵略戰爭刦掠他國、對於是非曲直一概置諸不理、無疑的吾軍旣爲正義及保衛祖國而戰、自必能造就英雄、在另一方面、德軍現以刦奪爲作戰目標、自必產生毫無精神之刦掠者、其次德軍進入吾內地愈深、則距離德後方更遠、而不得小在惡劣環境中作戰、蘇聯游擊隊破壞敵人後方、並粉碎敵人地位鞏固之信心、在另一方面紅軍則獲有全體蘇聯民衆之擁護、對於人力物力接濟無庸憂慮、吾軍堅强遠出德方意料之外、而德軍之弱亦爲彼等所意料不及、皆由於此故耳、在列寗格勒及莫斯科保衛戰中、吾軍擊毀德兵三十師、因此產生海陸空新人材、彼等將來必成爲德軍之患、無疑的、凡此種種均可預決德「閃電戰略」在東錢失敗之無可避免、</p>
<p>孤軍奮鬥遭遇逆境　盼望成立第二戰綫　　在若千方面、紅軍雖處於有利地位、但亦有不利之境、紅軍之所以暫時遭遇逆境、係由於歐洲方面缺乏對希特勒之第二戰錢、目前歐陸方面、並無英美軍隊向德法西斯軍隊作戰、因此德方無庸分散兵力在東西兩綫同時作戰、易言之、德方旣認爲西方無後顧之憂、乃以其全力並驅其盟國之兵力聯合對蘇進攻、目前眞實情形、厥爲蘇聯單獨向德芬羅義匈進行解放戰爭、而並未獲得任何人之軍事援助、德方對於其暫時成就、屢作自誇之言、並爲其軍隊大吹大擂、謂就一國軍隊　一國之軍隊而言、德必可擊敗蘇聯、但事實上壯種自誇極爲空洞、蓋德出現已不得不憑藉芬羅義匈軍隊之援助、而紅軍則仍單獨作戰也、</p>
<p>歐洲缺少第二戰綫已减輕德軍之顧慮、此點無容否認、同時苟歐陸能建成第二戰綫（吾人深信此點在最近將來必可成爲事實）則紅軍地位必可轉佳而對德不利、關於此點、亦毫無疑義、此外吾軍遭遇暫時逆境之另一原因、厥爲坦克及飛機之缺少、在現代戰爭中苟無坦克及充分飛機之援助、步兵作戰必甚困難、就質方面而言、吾空軍實勝於德法西斯、若干蘇聯　師且已　無畏戰士之榮譽、但其數量則不及德方之多、至於吾方坦克隊、在質及作戰方面、雖亦超過敵人、但其數量則較敵少數倍、此皆爲德方暫時勝利秘密、然則吾坦克之產量並未减少也、吾坦克製造業不斷以優良之坦克供給前綫、但德坦克產量則較吾多數倍、敵人不　在本國積極製造坦克、且利用捷·比荷·法工廠加緊生產、荀非如此、則紅軍早已擊敗　兵矣、良以由於吾方抵抗之勇猛、德軍從不敢離坦克作戰也、</p>
<p>雛貓雄獅比喻希拿　爭奪霸權一邱之貉</p>
<p>至于希特勒與傘破侖、吾人可作小猫與獅之比、蓋拿破侖係憑籍前進力量與反動力量作戰、而希特勒則係利用反動力量與前進力量作戰也、歐洲人民必起而反對希特勒之霸權、此點祇有希特勒不知之、孰不信任蘇英美將予歐洲人民以援助、對希特勒覇權進行解放戰爭乎、其次、德後方之情形又如何、希特勒黨因自稱消除凡爾賽條約之桎梏恢德國、故尙能獲得德人之擁護、但此項問題解決後、希特勒黨竟踏入帝國主義及侵略歐洲及蘇聯之途徑、而使德人成爲衆人之敵、德人之態度現已大爲改愛、彼等反對戰爭、深盼立即中止戰爭、不僅歐洲後方即德木國後方、已形成一火山、勢將爆發、將希特勒冒險家葬身其間、關於此點、祇有希特勒之愚蠢黨徒不知之、最後英美蘇已形成一整個陣綫、而決定以擊潰希特勒帝國主義份子爲目標、現代戰爭實係馬達戰爭、具有高越馬達產量之方面即可獲得勝利、英蘇美馬達之總量三倍於德國、此爲希特勒主義必敗主要原因之一、</p>
<p>英美予蘇切實援助　携手進行解放戰爭　　最近在莫斯科舉行之三强會議、已決定以坦克供給吾國、據衆人所知、吾人已開始獲得坦克及飛機之援助、此外、日前美國並已決定以十萬萬美元貸與蘇聯、吾人敢謂蘇英美之聯合確屬各符其實、而此種聯合必將繼續增强、吾人最先之目的、乃自德法西斯制度中解放吾人之領土及人民、同時並須援助斯拉夫及其他歐洲人民向希特勒暴政作解放之奮鬥、使其重獲生活自由、不受他人干涉內政、但爲實現此項目的起見、德侵略者之軍力必須予以粉碎、突入吾國土並圖奴役吾人之德侵略者、必須被全部毀滅、但爲實施此項任務、吾陸軍及海軍必須獲得全國之援助、因此、吾工人必須以更多之坦克飛機及大砲供給前方、吾農民必須以各種農物及原料儘景供給人民及工業、同時、吾全國及所有蘇維埃民族、亦必須團結一致與海陸軍並肩進行解放戰爭、毀滅希特勒軍隊、爲吾國爭取自由及榮譽、此即吾人目前之任務、吾人必能亦必須完成之、蓋唯有完成此項任務、擊潰敵人始能獲得永久及眞正之和平也、爲解放所有被壓迫之人民、爲全部毀滅德侵略者、吾人謹祝蘇聯各民族之友好永存不滅、並願吾紅軍海軍萬歲、吾祖國萬　、吾人爲正義血戰、勝利必屬於吾、」</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>期望於管理物價實施前</h3>
<p>數年來，上海市民所受操縱屯積之禍害，罄竹難書。卒爲環境特殊，不得不期望負有市政專責之工部局，暫且負起一般行政之責任，取締屯積。調劑供求，平準物價，安定民生，而以完成維持社會治安之最後目的。今則以工部局循行其例有之立法程序，已得領團核准新附則，不日可望付諸實現矣。就報章所載，工部局將後對此所有之設施，至低限度，必以調査所欲管理商品之存底，與其來踪去跡，兼公定零售價，而以廓淸投機操縱屯積居奇之塵氛，不使有鳶線式之飛騰，庶幾生活有一時安定之望，國際市塲仍得維持其原有之機能，無致崩潰。</p>
<p>然而行政之難，不難於形式之獲得，而難於名實之相副。夫能使大多數人獲福利，斯爲善政；若利爲少數人所沾，名爲多數人共負，因緣以爲姦，於中而漁利，則善政亦爲秕政矣。况商之爲商；惟利是圖；屯之爲屯，惟物是求；有鑒於局米在平穩之市情中，尙能見其維持平準之功，及至市價過漲過跌，不爲業中人所隱沒，卽爲業中人所摒棄，隱沒則大衆無從仰給，摒棄則採銷失所依據。故謂管制不容有例外，物價不容有軒輊；同一物也洞一價，異其等級殊其値；若旣有工部局公賣米，復有商人之自辦米，此其間再加以同等級異價格之米，同在一起出售，弊之由來，固安足怪。况上海各階層中，隱隱然各有一種反當勢力之存在，使循良安分遵守法令之輩，逡巡不欲前，舉發亦無益。不肖商人之善於舞弊，非徒對其顧客然，卽對於各方亦無不然，苟不能超然於利害之外，又不勝其人情物欲之私，孰有不爲所誘惑矇蔽，本以取締之者，甚或爲其作護身符，原以求民衆之福利，反使民衆蒙其害，事之顚倒反常有如此，要亦未能淸明在躬耳！</p>
<p>雖然事有不可以一槪而論者，在深明大體之商人，未嘗不以奸商之所作所爲爲非，但碍於其業務上之關係，未能作澄淸糾正之計。故吾人深盼此决管理物價之實行，能得各業中腎明公正之商人，在其商業道德正當營業之立塲，出而與工部局合作，使管理物價得收實際上之成效，而不失其業務上應得之利潤。惟管理物價之應有認識（一）以供給外匯之商品，此後決不容許商人再以黑黑匯不可捉摸之暗盤，及投機屯積之目的物，如美鈔港幣黃金棉紗等行市比例作價。但如此種黑市依然存在，則投機操縱之風不能絕，暴利主義深入人心，難免不使供匯之物品，仍將受其牽掣，而爲民生之大患。（二）由進口商或廠商直接批售貨物於門市店，其數量應以各該店最近數月門莊銷數之平均，作爲定額；再就所批售之貨量比例配給之，換言之，使門市店暫成爲代辦商之地位，而將各廠原有租界內之代理（或經售或包商）商契的取消，以期產（或進口商）銷直接，免除中間商之居積操縱，或將貨物陸續流入於屯戶手中。（三）各該物品在管理施行前所有之店存，棧存，廠存，及屯戶所存，均一一於最短之時期內由所有人向工部局登記，再由工部局分別規定其銷售辦法。或以為逕由工部局收買出之為當，而不念使工部局直接負某幾種商品營業上之責任，恐非所宜，故只要監督其不再操縱屯積，恢復正常交易，而得自由流通，是亦足已！至於隱匿不報，獎勵舉發，工部局自必有辦法，無庸多所論列。（四）就歷來商業上欺瞞隱蔽情形言，則如何可使供給之商品，不爲所隱藏利用，此實誠難；蓋其帳簿記載，常有出入，未盡可信。若市面平靜之際，一地間物價無所出入，無利可鑽，則亦無所用其弊。而在百物飛漲之今日，如限制過嚴，店家可百出其弊，以相抵制，或以决貨冒充，或以攙雜爲能，或以無貨相對，或另向最有利之途出售，或改換零售單位，或變更衡量之器。無非使消費者艱窘不堪，不得不屈意相從，扶同徇隱。使公家欲取締而患無口實，欲干涉而苦於缺證據，終至於無形放任，等功令於弁髦。（五）在管理期內，所有日用必需品旣由廠商或進口商直接售於門市商，行盤歸於畫一，出入自有定則，無所用其現貨市塲，以爲討論行情流通貨物之用，欲圖造成旣成事實，使工部局卽欲抑之使低，終於無可奈何。實則工部局旣決為公衆謀福利，不至默認投機操縱造成之物價，爲當然爲應分。蓋目前各種物價，均脫離實銷作用，而為屯戶貪欲之野心，以及黑黑匯，黑市金價之煽動，利用少數之物質，多數人之爭逐，把持不出之手段，轟動之而狂升猛漲。上海數百萬薪工階級所受嚴重深刻之苦痛，莫不以此為厲階，豈可作為正常之行市看待。工部局寗不明此種情况，豈有入其彀中，而作為公定物價之基價，決無是理。吾人以爲工部局此次公定物價最公允平正之辦法：1依據美英實施凍結中日資金前之上海物價。2依據供匯核算所得之價格。蓋平準會對於八月十八日前必需品進口請給外匯未經核准之數額，認爲若干情形可予考慮者，尙且補給所需之頭襯，維持貿易。由可知上海物價之規定，應以此為標準，無所用其懷疑；若反乎此，則有不無予人以疑寶。（七）日用必需物品之出售，必以普遍應用為原則；旣限制其購量，不應再從時間地點及貨物之有無（此如在物品絕對缺乏之非常情形下，自當別論，）相限制。蓋如出售之方式不善，原欲以抑平人心，而適以促成恐慌，最近各米店之出售公賣米，今日此家，明日彼家，求之者衆，應之者寡，得之愈難，而思得之者則愈切，於是民衆一聞有公賣米出售，千百人立集，擠軋傾跌，鞭捶足踢，願忍痛以相待，而終於赤手空袱返，彼因緣爲利之小販無足惜，一一家嗷嗷待哺有不得，誠劇可憐矣。至如何取締隱匿糴販是另一事，非可以緊縮各人購量，爲可杜其弊；而以「售完」爲可盡其責也。（八）因之而論分配之制，最爲複雜；有行之於他處良，而不能行於上海；以上海無此準備亦無此條件也。但工部局應知社會之羣，階層不齊；生活程度，高低不一；購買之力，大小懸殊，食指多寡，家戶不同。昔督恥爲五斗米折腰，而今欲求五斗公賣米不易得，非今昔人情逈異；環境不同，生活之咄咄逼人，良可慨也。故日常生活品之出售，利於散，不利於聚，便利大衆之需求。在昔辦平糶，非以營利爲目的，改低售價，賠貼人工，雖限制其量，猶且就全市設立一二十處，便利貿耀，其用心抑何周至。今公賣米非平耀可此，照其成本定價，未嘗有所减折，凡經售之者，行商有利，米號有利，而以之售於食戶，猶是通常之買賣。故政府供給以外匯，俾以維持全滬之民食，固當有適量之供給，以應民衆殷切之需求。豈可使民衆舍其所欲，求其所不欲，出不應出之代價，而維持其應有欲得之生存。是則公賣米出售之技術方面，旣未可為防制小販而執一以論，亦未可因噎廢食，而不謀改善。無論何種日用品，宜衡量其性質，籌畫其出售方式，總不外適應消費者適當生存之目的，策其應用之便利，無爲業內外屯戶席捲以去。然今之物價飛漲，進口商未必沾染，廠商未必全有益，批發商不至皆有利，好處均爲屯戶及門市批發之大小商家收去耳！姑不論紙烟火柴肥皂，卽如汽油每介侖五元二角，火油每介侖市售十一元，論品質，則火油不如汽油；論需要，則汽油遠不逮火油之普遍；然而火油之價，倍於汽油，猶且過之，蓋一則進口洋行自爲管理，（但亦有黑市）一則任令商屯自爲價。夫同是油也，火油爲大衆化之燃料，其行市之高漲，置之不問，此其所以寬嚴不同，殆爲火油專爲一般平民所用，呼聲不易入於洋行之耳。然如毛綸廠橡膠廠，已有調整售價之公開表示，期不爲屯戶所操縱。此如爲半製品，尙應顧及加工製造之出品，（一）能吾不爲廠家所操縱；（二）廠家卽不爲操縱，能吾不爲代理商門市商所居奇，而消費者，不得蒙其益，欲使管理物價能收效，治法治人，兼而有之，故調査稽核之組織，不容不嚴密；允貴乎執行具有精細明練嚴正公允之精神，熟悉商情民瘼，旣不爲情感所衝動，亦不爲勢力所轉移，而又須富於人類同情心，庶幾痌瘝在抱，實心實力，爲民衆謀福利。</p>
<p>茲於管理物價未實施前，致其期望之忱，甚盼有以副民衆之熱望也。</p>

<h3>投機紗布多變幻　跌漲之幅度擴大故將加收證據金　擠軋之風浪太大特別放寬交解紗</h3>
<p>紗市已見回風、此因黃金下落、人心怠懈、及盈利多頭一律出籠、於是檯面更見鬆動、二十支雙馬廠單、晨開價即跌三十元、爲三千一百二十元、但證券帮在市紛紛出檔、尤使氣勢帶餒、同時期貨亦吿下墜、龍頭布傾回下游、因之浮空愈形活躍、市盤逐步跌至三千零二十五元、然低價一現、某某大戶對於多頭始終不願放棄、乘低時收進、徐徐升至三千零八十元、然黃金仍疲弱、迨至收盤時依然軟弱、價爲三千零二十五元、査成交情形尙稱熱鬧、</p>
<p>現紗情况、開盤跟踪廠單而疲弱、價格一致下降、無奈十支粗紗買者與緻獨濃、市盤反硬、不知一般囤貨者、不進細紗、惟獨專在粗紗上吸收、所以近來之情况、粗緊細鬆、査半日間成交僅三百八十包、行情粗跌二·三十元、細疲八·九十元之譜、</p>
<p>午後市象頗弱、謂黃金續下、期紗吿跌、龍頭布亦帶軟化、所以人心不振、預料今天開低盤矣、</p>
<p>雙馬交換辦事處、昨日午後召集同業聯繫會議、曾擬營業範圍擴大、前次自屢次漲停板跌停板、繁不勝繁、茲以為改變方針、將滬埠各廠所有出品之二十三支裝璜及二十支裝璜、一律編製等級、均可交解、如斯一來、皆可免得擠空擠多、如果審査完竣、定於下週一當　照常交易、</p>
<p>廿支雙馬紗、廠單投機市塲、自再三跌停板、及多空雙方、以二千三百七十元結價、停頓以來、快逾一週、茲經記者探悉、紗公會經紀人交換會議決定下星期一（十一月十日）重行開拍、跌停扳與漲板停、以每件紗一百六十元、爲一個階段、（較結價前之八十元標準、爲加倍）黑市塲上業已揭示黑板、通吿同業與客戶矣而證券大樓各銀號、對於各客戶投機交易每包棉紗證金、亦須加倍、（原來本祇每包一百元、嗣改兩百元、今則須四百元矣、）以避風險、然則此後的投機客戶、又須增重一倍本錢、投機者必較前爲减、而投機對象之棉紗籌碼、或可較前寬裕、投機者之興趣、已少殺、然而以後投機廠單賣買、誠可爲而不可爲、（駒）</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、由平而下瀉、驟起猛烈之跌風蓋新做以來、市價暴升已巨、一般買戶在此新高峰、已有利可獲、加以國外消息較爲和緩、金市急轉下瀉、曾一度步入二萬元大關內、是以紗市人心虛弱、頗有出籠、且雜牌紗亦疲、致有供過於求現象、晨初開出十月份尙帶堅勢、爲三〇三〇元、微升五元、入後因現金下墮、乃亦轉疲、十二月份做爲三〇五〇元、已降五十元、一月份爲三一四〇元、亦降三十八元、入後未見回頭、午收各小六七十至近百元不一、午後仍以賣方所脅、勢甚萎頓、乃先後續瀉、近期曾瀉至二八二八元、十二月份亦低至二九四〇元、一月份小至三〇五〇元低價、旋因浮空略補、稍見回上、結果一致下跌一百二三十元至一百九十六元不等、茲列表於後、</p>

<p>紐約棉市不定而有參次、先因同業買進及空頭抵補而漲、繼因南方幫不斷套賣及多頭獲利了結回跌、結果收盤價格、除現貨較上日漲二磅音外、其餘各跌五六磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因棉產收獲估計减低、及大量空頭抵補而漲、後因歐洲出口商售出及多頭獲利了結而再跌、結果昨日收盤價格、仍漲一二羅比左右、又預測令日開盤市况、看跌半羅比、</p>
<h3>粗布細布　各跌十元</h3>
<p>廠布續見疲落、乃因同業與囤戶獲利出籠之故、惟後市微見回漲、結果白貨粗細布斜紋跌二元至五元、漂染布廠盤不動、手貨跌三五元、十六磅花蝶·變象粗布暴落十元之多、本街成交獨多、計五百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　晨開已露疲狀、但因金價尙堅升、跌後復升、終因同業賣氣濃厚、跌風續盛、龍頭細布廠單上午自一百十八元開盤、降至一百十五元、下午最小價見一百　元、收盤時稍昂、爲一百十四元、較前日猛落每疋十元左右、四君子嘰嗶晚收三元九角七分、亦慘跌每碼二角之巨、</p>
<h3>市小絞米　所跌較鉅</h3>
<p>洋米市因前朝一度回高後、實銷轉懈、復呈疲軟、乃邇來皮球交易已難發展、全賴實銷支撑、敌早市開手買戶見實銷不暢、卽在多方求脫、惟當時尙承上日餘勢、猶無輕售之心、市面尙屬平穩、開出一號兩貢一百九十五元半、一百九十五元、二號一百八十五元、渣華米一百九十元、且爲二號暹　因籌碼已稀、而一般店舖、因發售工部局小絞之際、恐進市上小絞、有魚目混珠之嫌、故都改進他貨、然中段貨中惟有二號暹邏較康、一時應需頓浩、衆目所注、二號暹邏去路獨旺、更見俏色、開出一百七十五六元、次一百七十三元半、而小絞仍亦開出一百六十五六元、然後終因實銷懈淡、市色難以支撑、各價步步落低、所以收盤行情、一號西貢一百九十二元、中關一百八十九元、二號一百八十二至一百八十元、一號暹邏高自一百九十元、次至一百八十五元、二號一百七十五元、渣華尖一百八十七八元、敏黨高一百八十六七元、中關一百八十二元、次至一百七十九元、碎高自一百三十七八元、次至一百三十三元、比前均回低二三元、至於小絞處此實銷已絕、而心思交易並屬鐵羽、所謂盛極必衰、物極必反、茲則猶似敝屣、乏人受主，遂獨猛跌、收盤跌至一百六十元、一百五十九元、計瀉六七元之巨、誠亦快事也、</p>
<p>至英華司（一石二斗半）小紋亦小二三元、價自二百元小至一百九十七八元、成交現貨一萬三千包、英華司四五百噸、全日市勢、爲囤戶出籠抑低、兼以平價小絞源源到滬、路貨不久亦將湧到、而新定亦在接洽中、加之謠言利賣、嗣後形勢恐難振作也、</p>
<p>厚薄粳因到貨寥落、是雖銷塲有限貨主售意仍堅、結果售價續提二三元、開南港早破二百零五元、次至二百零二元、崑山新粳二百零六元、特別二百零八九元、青角窰種一百零四五元、六種二百零六元、杜尖百九十元、</p>
<p>糯米供求　仿、未有榮辱、繼開香港百元高自二百二十元、次至二百十八元、特二百二十二元、糯菉二百零四五元、金丹新國元二百零九元、靑角新陰元一百九十七元、</p>
<h3>洋粉收買漸淡</h3>
<p>洋粉仍乏正市、然以米跌金平、已令投機乏興問津、而工部局之平價粉公賣亦在籌劃實現中、所以街銷消淡、客囤亦少問津、塲外暗盤交易頓見疲而乏消，坎粉金龍牌一度喊五十七元乏人接受、後開五十六元仍乏暢化、結果比前市已小元半、麩皮定勢、小麥到稀見俏、</p>
<h3>雜糧暗盤交易減</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧暗盤交易略减、乃因實銷迄鮮動辦、買戶甚稀、市勢轉趨軟化、聞大有廠淸油售價爲二百八十元、又菜油二百七十三元、日華廠菜油二百七十元、泰山廠菜油二百六十七元、常州牛皮黃一百零九元半、嗬囒黃苞米五十元零五角、又白苞米四十八元、西貢新苞米十月份裝九十五元半至九十五元、又十一月份裝九十五元、</p>
<h3>黃金飛漲過高　引起津幫傾賣　狂跌一千七百餘元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、突起慘烈狂跌、價已破入二萬元大關內、各方人心一致向下、實因近來飛漲過高、較香港金價高逾三千元以上、比天津金價軋漲尤巨、該幫於前日已有四千二百兩運來抵滬、委證券號巨額傾出、某現金號及銀號出籠亦勤、銀行幫仍有搜羅、曾被提升至二萬一千一百元、但不久復處於賣風中、見一萬九千二百元低價後轉入盤境、終見軋小一千七百十元、全日成交在一萬兩以上、飾金亦小一百五十元、爲二千零二十元、紋銀銀樓已恢復掛牌爲二十八元、軋升六元、今天週六聯易市塲爲便利會員現金收解、故上午營業時間改爲九時開市、十點半收市、</p>
<p>現貨跌進二萬元大關</p>
<p>烚赤現貨晨在一致賣風中、進者不敢落手、故開市已低八百十元、爲二萬零六百元、天元順源進回升至九百元、恒記德孚大豐售出、銳退四百五十元、至二萬零四百五十元、忽見明豐等吸收、天元亦買、價被抬起六百五十元、升至二萬一千一百元、津幫猛烈傾出、德孚等亦賣、市勢大虛、價竟狂瀉一千四百元、跌至一萬九千七百元、明豐重來力進、大豐等亦來吸收、立見飛升七百五十元、達二萬零四百五十元、午刻天元吐售、又見壓下、午收二萬零一百元、下午進者觀望、又在賣勢下開低九百元、爲一萬九千二百元、不免過低、德成永成力進、當見飛抬上六百元、成記等售出至一萬九千五百元、祥和德孚又猛進、抬至九百五十元、恒記等吐售、又抑退至五百元、時和大豐收吸、提升達一萬九千八百五十元、天元吐售、收市一萬九千七百元、比上日牧價、猛跌一千七百十元、全日有一千九百元上落、現金號之本脾金、門市售價二萬元左右、收進比售價低千元、</p>
<p>飾金掛小一百五十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行上午掛小三次、低一百二十元、下午又小三十元、爲二千零二十元、（收進减一百五十元）軋小一百五十元元、</p>
<h3>紐約電匯　四元求售者頗衆　金鎊暴落四十元</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、中央與匯豐兩掛牌均平、英美匯小櫃檯價仍未更、英美匯黑市續稍帶鬆、乃中日間又有無糟之傳說也、英匯曾出二辦士關外、某華商投機家售予進口洋行額千鎊、價爲二辦士一二五、華匯二元八七五有不少兜售者、進口洋行之還價爲三元及三元二五、紐約電匯四元求售者頗衆、蓋該匯至紐約即被凍結也、午刻更露鬆狀、下午又歸沉寂、直至四點收市英金二辨士可結、美金三元、較上日稍見軋鬆、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價暴落四十元、英金票亦小三元、美金票復入四十元關、且一度退至三十八元七角、後又回上至三十九元三角、但比上日仍軋跌一元、香港票猛降五角、日金票及朝鮮票亦均趨疲、前者退爲三元八角八分、後者降至三元七角九分、</p>
<h3>內債微漲</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市比較堅俏、實因金子及棉紗跌落而補空較多、人心較强、丙種又衝出六元關、惜下午川幫又有賣出、人氣爲之一挫、惟川幫如無繼續賣出、暫時不易看小、丁種准十日舉行第十二次抽籤、故自今日起市塲即除中籤計算、上午鑫豐聯益生興買進、同康同順森昌聯和久豐等賣出、丙種一度見六元、旋又回進、午後人心頗好、協興元順泰鼎康補進、潤德益昌亦有買進、丙種高價見六十二元五角、旋以川幫又有賣出、寶隆同康同順久豐仍繼續賣出、收幣時比較略疲、市價結果一律回漲三四角至七角不等、成交約一百八十萬元茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交交通銀行股二百股、價爲一百七十元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市續呈活潑、在强大買風中、新價時有出現、收盤市况略軟、紗廠股不復爲人重視、趨勢似難言堅、殆因前數日拉抬過甚所致、橡皮股買戶購興愈益濃厚、上騰時出高價不易羅致、收盤雖亦小回、大都價格較前收仍高不少、</p>
<h3>食糖方欲下墜　即有新囤收進</h3>
<p>昨糖市上午仍因浮多出籠而跌、兼以某種空氣利於空方、故跌勢尤甚、及至下午、有新囤戶趁低吸收、價乃回好、公司期貨二四粗白、上午二百九十三元停板、下午開盤二百七十五元、收盤八十四元最高九十一元、最低七十三元、二十日期上午三百零一元停板、下午開盤三百十五元、收盤二十六元、最高三十元、最低十五元、跌三十二元至十三元、現貨二四粗白十月份入口三百零六元、驟降至二百八十元、後爲九十五元、下午因多方吸收而升至三百十二元、中途略小爲零一元、後復高至二十元、小五元、九月份二百八十元至三百十五元、小九元、八月份二百七十五元、至三百十元、小十一元、七月份二百七十五元、至三百元、小十元、香港粗白上午竟小至二百六十元、下午回好二十元、爲二百七八十元、比前日尙小九元半、荷赤二百三十八元、至六十五元、小五元、太古車白B嘜二百元、下午三百十五元、反升五元、HX嘜二百八十元、三百元、反升十五元、共成交期貨三萬八千餘包、現貨二萬九千餘包、</p>
<h3>螟蜅鮝續升</h3>
<p>寗波海味、近日螟蜅鮝依然上展、如舟山貨已達五百五十元、烟台貨五百四十元、寗波三百六十元、寗子淡八百元、</p>
<h3>栗　（續十月十三日）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>栗的吃食法，唐宋以前人議論記錄出來的大概不多。杜甫詩句有「山家蒸栗暖」一語；宋初人陶榖在所作的淸異錄上也說：「晋王—李克用—嘗窮追汴師，—朱全忠的兵—糧運不絕，蒸栗以食：軍中遂呼票爲河東糧。」我們借此可以知道唐朝時候的人會吃食「蒸栗」。宋梅堯臣尹陽尉耿傳惠新栗詩，有「野人寒齋會，山爐夜火砲」之句：大概是把栗子放在爐火當中燒熟，如同我們現在所稱的「爆栗」一樣。眞正」炒栗」的吃法，也是起源於宋時的。陸游老學庵筆記上說：故都—汴京—李和煼（同炒），名聞四方，他人百計效之，終不可及。紹與中，陳福公……出使至燕山，忽有兩人持　栗各十裹來獻，……自贊曰：「李和兒也」！揮涕而去。」他又有夜食炒栗有感「齒根浮動嘆吾衰，山栗砲燔療夜飢」的詩句，也可以證明此說（未完）</p>

<h3>滬市食米外匯頭襯　月供二十五萬包　總値約合國幣四千萬元　煤斤外匯月給美金百萬</h3>
<p>美孚火油因有人轉手漁利昨臨時停售</p>
<p>關於工部局總董李德爾及美董明思德兩氏赴港接洽進口品所需外滙事、新聲社記者昨據權威方面透露、平準基金委員會對滬市民食、極表關懷、現已決定每月供給最高限度爲二萬五千噸、即廿五萬包食米進口所需之外匯頭襯、總値約合美金二百萬元、照平準會所定五元三四三七五之滙率計算、數近國幣四十萬元、因此以後、滬市民食、可告穩定、而其前途、愈顯光明、至於麵麥煤斤等所需進口外滙、正由工部局兩代表與平準會商討中、據悉煤斤一項、有每月給滙美金一百萬元之希望、</p>
<p>售平米處　設捕房內</p>
<p>茲悉法租界當局重申前令、任何人如無法警務處之特別許可證、一概不准述米出境、但此項禁令、並不適用於遝往公共租界之食米、如遇有遠反此禁令者、法警務處當將該項食米立即予以沒收、又昨據大中社記者自負貴方面獲悉、關於工部局設立平價港米售賣所二處、以便利市民購買事、現正在積極進行中、工部局總裁費利溥、巳於昨日接見曾向工部局申請願負責辦理售米事宜之合格米商二人、詻詢一切、若進行順利、則可望於下星期一成立、開始售米、聞地點將暫假公共租界內捕房、但此說尙未經當局證實、工部局並定於十日下午二時召開麥粉平賣委員會、討論粉價、</p>
<p>保險業已　獲利外滙</p>
<p>上海保險業公會、爲謀對保險費獲得外匯起見、曾派代表赴港、與平準會香港辦事處提出要求、聞已商有辦法、各代表以在港事畢、業巳啟程返滬、至商定辦法之內容、據香港財政界傳出消息、大致如决、（一）因保險關係獲得外滙者、其保險公司或其分公司、必須係向中國政府註冊、而設於上海者、其被保險人、其國籍屬於中·英·美者爲限、（二）保險公司所收入之外匯、及其損失之補償、不問其純利如何、均須提供於平準會、（三）外滙供給於每半期之末、實行老查其前半期之情形、再行許可、（四）每期純利、佔保險費收入百分之二十以上時、其百分之二十、可供給外匯、如純利在百分之二十以下時、其全部純利、均可供給外滙、（五）支付外貨保險費時、應按公定價格、以法幣計算、（六）支付海外保險費時、可給予外滙、</p>
<p>物價會議　逐日舉行</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、對管理物價問題、昨日一午、曾繼續舉行會議，據悉工部局於本星期來、總辦間會議室中、幾每日均有會議、籌備實施管理物價、覓取切實有效辦法、若干囤積漁利商人、對於工部局與進口商人、將以聯合一致之力量、抑平物價之行動、已表示震驚、又本市著名美國傑美西菜館及夜總會主人傑姆斯、今晨稱、渠願貢獻一制止囤積漁利之强有力武器、將彼所經營之銀都夜花園、在每日上午八時至下午五時、充作零售商店、所售物品、僅准取百分之十或二十之最低利潤、</p>
<p>美孚火油　臨時停售</p>
<p>美孚火油公司、今晨突然停止零售火油、致欲購買火油者、擁塞於四川路廣東路美孚火油公司前、不下數百人、其中有貧苦俄人及其他西人的百人、華人約四百人、交通爲之阻滯、該公司緊閉鐵門、故羣衆無法入內、據該公司某職員今晨稱、該公司爲避免紛擾、且以零售辦法、頗多流弊、故決停止門售、聞有人在該公司購火油一聽、價格爲五十二元、但一轉手携往他處出售、即可得八十元、此顯係漁利行爲、故決予制止、公衆如需美孚火油、仍可向各地該公司分銷處購買、又稱如工部局不採防止辦法、恐將有同樣囤積火油之情事發生、</p>
<p>民衆團體　擁護管制</p>
<p>立德聯誼社等民衆團體、工部局有呈請領團授權管理物價與組織進口商協會之舉、特聯合宣言擁護、並促早日實現、以蘇民困、略謂、滬市自淪爲孤島、游資　集、投機風熾、以致造成物價上漲、然從未有若邇來之甚者、此不特市民生活感受嚴重威脅、即社會安寗、亦將招致甚大危險、今工部局鑒於情勢之嚴重、毅然負荷艱鉅、解民倒懸、凡屬中外明達之士、自當竭誠擁護、本社等忭慰之餘、略抒所見、</p>
<p>（一）進行宜速　工部局對平衡物價、就過往而言、每多失之迂緩、遷就事實、致爲投機者所乘、今後務期迅赴事功、凡事之能便民者、儘可當機立斷也、（二）杜絕投機、工部局應迅即封閉界內一切投機市塲、釜底抽薪、以杜絕投機者之淵藪、同時對於囤積好商、大可援用非常時期懲治好商條例、處以極刑、使眛心奸商、知所炯戒、（三）評定價格、組織一强有力而完善之評價機關、舉凡一切日用物品、如食物燃料醫藥布疋食油肥皂火柴等類、調查其成本、評定合理之售價、母許踰越、</p>
<p>（四）調查存貨　迅將各棧存貨數量及其所有者姓名、詳加調查、如有業外人積儲之貨料、或業內人積儲貨料超過常度者，一律依其進價收歸公有、公平支配、銷售市塲、並希望各業薪水階級、隨時將本業所有貨物之成本公開發表、以供評價機關之參攷、免爲黠者所蒙蔽、（五）鼓勵吿密、市民應隨時隨地、協助當局、調查各業所有物品之成本及囤積居奇者之姓名、翔實報吿、允應鼓勵市民吿密、</p>
<p>夫工部局以超然之地位、猶爲我市民解救倒懸、我市民更應通力合作、共濟艱危、切勿但圖一己之私利、置國族前途於不顧、不恤推波助瀾、希冀混水撈魚、要知滬市之有今日、厥由於政府之供給外滙、設我人不能體念政府維持之苦心、最後唯有忍痛割絕、彼輩囤積居奇者、必將自食其果、所有貨物、其能不遭强暴者之攫取乎、是則罔論貧富、唯有同歸於盡云、皮之不存、毛將焉附、願我市民長思之、聞本市節約運動委員會、昨亦勸吿各業商人、共謀遏阻物價無理上漲、</p>

<h3>取締慈善獎券要求　當局未予研究　基督教團體認有賭博性　但有極多貧民賴以救濟</h3>
<p>二十個基督敎團體之代表、頃巳聯合致函公共租界工部局與法租界公董局要求取締慈善獎券、函中略謂、獎券乃一種賭博、而一切賭博之性質、皆與竊盜無殊、以其欲無功而獲取他人之錢財也、獎券不獨在民衆間養成賭博習慣、抑且產生竊盜之精神、故兩租界內、亟宜取締慈善獎券、必要時、儘可訴諸於法</p>
<p>提出些項申請之理由、可分三點如下、（一）獎券乃賭博、在道德上流毒殊深、有害於民衆、尤共是華人、在原則上、發行獎券與設賭窟並無差別、然獎劵流毒更廣、以其惡毒之影響、且及於無數從不入賭窟者之家中也、獎券發行、乃搜括許多人之金錢、而僅以其中一部份給予少數人（二）中英美三國法律、均規定獎券爲違法、上海自應依此最高之道德標準、（三（基督敎不欲他人以摧毀人民道德的方法獲得之款項、以資助基督敎之慈善事業云、聯名申請之宗敎團體、有中國內地會·美以美敎會·聖經公會·浸禮會·慕爾堂·救世軍·及美國長老會等、又英文大美晚報云本市當局對於敎會團體、爲求廢除難民獎券而與之所謂「基督敎十字軍」、將置之不理</p>
<p>蓋據駐滬法總領事馬傑禮今（七日）晨向記者稱、慈善獎券乃合法成立者、敎會團體之反對、並無理由也、馬氏又稱、駐滬法總領署授此獎券以發行之權、並派管理員一人、督監開獎等事宜云、慈善獎券辦事人員、對敎會團體之申請、亦表異議、據謂、慈善獎券自二十七年八月創辦起、至本年八月底爲止、已以一百七十餘萬元發給各慈善機關而參與此申請之救世軍、亦於十一月間獲得法總領事撥給之慈善獎券盈餘四千元云、工部局官員對此拒不發何言論、僅謂該局現致力於本市嚴重之民食情勢云、按敎會團體之申請函中、簽名代表、以蘭金氏爲首、蘭金近曾對字林報刋獎券廣吿而起訴、</p>

<p>咋報載有「恐嚇匪丁貽瑞等七人，赴南京路虹廟燒香求願後，即向義生橡膠廠經理投函恐嚇，竟被索去一千五百元，經探捕查悉，將丁等七人捕獲，並云丁等曾於得錢後，製「有求必應」匾額，送往虹廟，調查屬實，法院不日宣判。」</p>
<p>這件事情，大家都覺得匪徒異想天開，眞可謂「有趣的可惡事件」，常然匪徒犯法是事實，自有法律裁判，我們所要說的，是附帶的感想：</p>
<p>恐嚇事件，在上海是司空見慣的了，所新寄的却是「求願恐嚇」，匪徒目無法紀，倒還心中有佛，他們所恭送的匾額，依我的看法或許是一副忘了上聯的聯語，他們的聯語，應該是「我雖然無惡不作，你總該有求必應。」其實今日上海的社會，天天放多頭空頭的空氣，米蠢說存棧不豐，煤商說來源不暢，一切一切無非恐嚇市民，冀發大財，匪徒在得錢後，覺得雖敢欺人，不敢欺天，所以去做這種「此地無銀三百兩，隔壁小二不曾偷」的上匾了願，至於這些投機商人，有囤皆嫌，無利不圖，比較恐嚇匪，作惡何止千百倍，可是除了對於他們的嬌妻美愛子意揮霍有求必應而外，甚麼都漠不關心，當然如果能在閻王殿上「有錢不死」的匾額，他們是要悉力以赴的。</p>
<p>佛云，四大皆空，現在匪徒恐嚇，居然幸未落空，然而瑯璫入獄，結果還是一塲空，他們求財必應，可是逃不了罪刑，有求必應於他們是利是害，到今日方知悔之已晚，那來一般投機牟利者，有的巳經不齒社會，有的正在自投法網，今日的無惡不作，有求必應，也就是來日的有錢受累，無子不敗。水能載舟，亦能覆舟，錢能救人，亦能殺人，希望一切有形無形的恐嚇者，立刻覺醒，莫走自殺之途！</p>
<p>匪徒所上的匾，居然自稱弟子，眞是有辱佛門，像道些犯法的「弟子」，終被置諸於法，正是我佛「威靈顯赫」罷！我不是佛敎徒，但是我倒有一句「誠則靈」的戒條，我想凡是什麼求名求利，求一切的滿足慾望，總是枉然，只有至誠，坦白，純潔，熱烈，忠誠的待人，至誠的自律，求自己良心之所安，那眞是可以有求必應，有求必靈，這些恐嚇匪，上匾到虹廟，固然可笑，終是可憐</p>

<h3>莫斯科的防空</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>自從七月二十一日受第一次空襲以來，莫斯科現在簡直天天受着德機的森炸。根據共間所得的豐富的經騐，莫斯科的防空陣綫也逐步在改進，充寳着，</p>
<p>目下莫斯科的防空是由五種要素形成的：（一）高射砲，（二）飛機，（三）輕氣球隊，（四）消防隊，（五）自衛隊。就性質上而言，前三者屬於攻勢，而後兩者則屬於消極的防禦。</p>
<p>自衛隊是由市民組織而成，它的任務是：傳達命令，協助消防，搶救受傷者等。凡是十六歲以上六十歲以下的男子都有參加該隊的義務，而遇緊急時，十八歲以上五十歲貝下的女子也在動員之列。</p>
<p>飛機和高射砲都配置於莫斯科的外圍各要點，竭力堵擊德機的竄入莫期科城內，而和它們密切合作的就是莫斯科城外每隔十公里散佈的飛機監視員。可是按諸過去的經騐，敵機仍不免有一部分掠過防空網，出現於城內上空投下炸裂彈和燒夷彈。在這時候最要緊是把損害减到最低限度。因此防空壕及燒夷彈之防御等都是不可缺的設備。關於這　點，蘇聯當局於戰前在莫斯科所建世界最大，設備最優秀的地下鐵道，可說是極有先見之明。地下鐵道目下被用作最大的防空壕，可是它常然不能將莫斯科全市人民收容於其中。因此各大厦的地下室都被迅速地改造爲防空壕。這些地下窒戰前都是作茶飯堂，倉庫等用，有着椅子等設備，因此用作防空壕是極合理想的。</p>
<p>地下鐵道每晚到八點至九點就變成防空壕了。在沒有空襲警報的時候，從下午九點起准許婦孺入內。在經過最後一輛電車的軌道上舖了木板，再在上面搭起床舖。遇到空襲綫報時，一般男女才得跑進來，擠在月台上或鋪着板的軌道上。爲應一般人的需要，這裏有食物及飲料出賣，並且在有些車站還有新聞片放映，因此躱在裹面也並不覺怎樣無聊。</p>
<p>莫斯科的各公寓每一層都有砂和水的準備。浴盆整天須盛滿水，而鏟，鋤，鐮，滅火器，燈範，防燒夷彈面罩等都須事先準備妥當。在開戰之初，當局曾令各戶於空襲時應緊閉窗戶，可是根據實際經騐，遇到炸力極大的，炸彈時，閉着的窗門要比開着的窗門玻璃更易震碎。於是當局又改正前令，一遇綫報除地下室以外，窗戶均須一律開放。而地下室的窗戶都用沙袋及木板蓋住，這也是爲預防玻璃的震碎。</p>
<p>莫斯科對於燒夷彈的防禦可說書着最大的努力。而關於這方面最賣力的就是上面所述的自衛隊。於空襲綫報發出後，自衛隊中比較活潑的靑年都爬到屋頂上去，監視燒夷彈的投擲，可是經過二三次空襲後，證明在屋頂上監視是非常危險的，因爲高射砲的彈片會像雨一般地落在身上。於是按照新規則，監視員應在頂樓從事監視。當他一看見燒夷彈落在屋頂時，他馬上從頂樓的窗中跳出，用木棒把它推落在街上或園子中。在下面則有另一批自衛隊隊員等待着，一看見燒夷彈落下就趕快用砂和水把它熄滅。自衛隊在幹着這英勇的工作時，其行動之敏捷是値得欽佩的。</p>
<h3>「猪的問答」</h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>我們在波列斯朋著的「人生目的」中，看到了「猪的問答」，他用諷刺的口吻，寫出猪的生活的目的。</p>
<p>他說「猪的生活，不過一天到晚地，在盡量的喝泔脚，打懶陲，以保持牠們的肥胖，造成可口的火腿而已！但是，即是使牠們不是這樣做，火腿的供給，仍屬他們的命運」。</p>
<p>可是人類的命運，並不是在做火腿的供給，爲什麼有許多人也是愚蠢德如猪一般呢？如猪一般地走向着同一命運呢</p>
<p>不管你有數萬萬金元，不管你有多大的虛名權勢，但是你若死後，就沒沒無聞如猪一股地的命運，你對於人類有什麼共享哩！那是多麼可憐阿！</p>
<p>難道我們生在現社會裏，是不是單就獲得了吃飯睡覺就完了嗎？</p>

<p>十四打英雄的生活「太太，我聽你好幾决提到什麼嚮導社，多為我爸爸的性子太固執，沒有讓你把我荐去。可是我仔细想想，卽然你說只是伴着外路來的人買買東西，親逛公園的事，實在沒有什麼大關係，可惜我自己也是才到才海的鄉下人，不然眞想請你把我荐去試試看。」</p>
<p>那個十足白相人嫂嫂式的女人聽了她這篇話，幾乎喜得連鼻子也笑起來。便說祇要你字識得多，上海的路是最容易找的，當下也來不及再和梅寳說別的話，便忙着催促她梳洗起來，趕到一家所謂融融嚮導社去。</p>
<p>還虧梅寳非常機智，一瞧那間小小的亭子間裏坐滿了許多濃裝艷抹的女人，和幾個拆白黨式的男子，心裹便恍然大悟；忙在那個老闆娘不曾達到出賣她的目的以前，急急忙忙的逃了回來。</p>
<p>因爲有了這件事，她對於謀生的不易，不覺也有了相當認識，同時還知道女人家的出路的確比男人更困難；所以秋海棠回家來說的一篇話，她聽了心裏儘管覺得很可疑，却也沒有勇氣再追問。</p>
<p>秋海棠見女兒已經相信，便越發放下愁腸，竭力裝出歡天喜地的樣子。（二五七）</p>

<h3>曼兒奧勃朗談　妻子為什麼離開丈夫</h3>
<p>— 禮義</p>
<p>好萊塢影星曼兒奧勃朗，這一個活躍的明星，最近曾憑她三寸不爛之舌，駁倒一個大學敎授的說法，爲女界增光不少，事情是這樣的：費蘭特爾非亞的法律敎授約翰漢凡氏，曾列舉六條理由，說明一個丈夫爲什麼不喜歡同他的妻子在一起，內中有一條說：「她們在早餐時蓬首垢面，衣履不整。」</p>
<p>「約翰敎授的話雖有可取之點」，曼小姐不服地批評道，「但他忽略了這問題有兩方面，故必須自妻子方面來觀察一下才是！」</p>
<p>曼小姐於是也列舉六條理由，爲什麼妻子常不願與文夫一起，寗願獨自出去散步一下，那因爲丈夫們犯了下列蔑樁毛病：</p>
<p>（一）　整天地躱在自己的辦公室裏。</p>
<p>（二）　認爲讀書閱報，比家常談話有趣。</p>
<p>（三）　開口店舖，閉口工塲，好像爲職業而活着一般。</p>
<p>（四）　她去同他談談，對你像猪一般的叫。</p>
<p>（五）　留心藝術，文化等，他事不放在心上。</p>
<p>（六）　把「愛」認作陳年舊貨。</p>
<p>曼小姐下個結論：「丈夫們如能矯正這幾點缺憾，那末許多妻子們或者不會再在早餐時蓬頭垢面，衣履不整了！」</p>
<p>聽哪！曼小姐的話是何等眞實，同時又何等風趣！</p>

<p>坤角鬚生張文涓上月出演黃金，輿論賣座都佳，她在黃金輟演以後，本來打算就北返的，後來因為亞爾西愛勝利公司託丁悚畫師與她談判灌片的事，所以暫時躭擱下來。灌片的談判很順利，灌的是「全本奇冤報」，一共十二面，從行路起至討盆止，由南方第一名丑劉斌崑等配演張別古諸角，操琴的就是鼎鼎大名的左手大王趙喇嘛。「奇寃報」是譚派名劇，也是文涓的得意之作，北上以後，有許多小腔復經孟小冬爲之指正，因之益覺十全十美。全部唱詞及音韻，事前更研究了七次之多，方於昨日下午在勝利全部灌竣。</p>
<p>據勝利蒲美鐘君談：歌曲唱片能够傾銷南洋，而且在國內也比較普及，所以現在唱片公司在多收這些唱片，至於平劇，銷路只限於一部分愛好平劇者之間，因此收得不多，這次我們請張小姐灌唱「全部奇冤報」，是經過一番考慮認為頗有把握才決定的，所以唱片至遲到本月底可以出貨。</p>

<h3>The Heroic Stand of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union: America Resolves to Give Full Assistance; Roosevelt's Address to the International Labor Organization: Encouraging Representatives to Strive for Freedom</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th - President Roosevelt (pictured) last night addressed the International Labor Office assembly here, reiterating America's firm resolve to aid China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. He stated that after years of trials, the ILO has consistently worked to reduce working hours, protect female and child labor in agriculture and industry, improve the living conditions of sailors, and make factories and mines suitable workplaces for humanity. Though, due to the upheaval of the world war, which has lasted over two years, and driven by the tyranny of Hitler, you have left your permanent offices in Geneva, through the efforts of our friend, Mr. Winant (former director of the ILO and later U.S. Ambassador to Britain), you have been able to continue your duties here. You are prepared, when the world war ends, to fulfill your responsibilities in formulating the social policies that will underpin lasting peace. The core of our struggle lies in freedom for all. Without enlightened social policies, there can be no true freedom for the common person. In the final analysis, what democratic nations are fighting for today is precisely this enlightened social policy. Your concerns are the concerns of the people of all democratic nations. For many member states, participating in the ILO has come at great sacrifice. Yet, representatives from nations groaning under the yoke of dictators still faithfully attend this meeting, which is the greatest testament to the ILO’s vitality. Therefore, I welcome these representatives. Some labor leaders are today languishing in concentration camps for daring to uphold principles without which civilization cannot exist. I extend my hand in encouragement to these representatives of labor. To those of you who come from devastated regions, America wishes to tell your people, "You have not been forgotten." America is now striving to assist nations resisting aggression. For example, workers in Wisconsin, who used to manufacture aluminum products, have sacrificed their livelihoods so that we can build airplanes to aid Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. The majority of rubber workers in various factories have also sacrificed immediate employment opportunities so that ships can transport airplanes and tanks to Liverpool, Akansas, and Rangoon. Hundreds of thousands of automobile workers have also switched to other jobs so that the steel used for automobiles can be used by American factories to manufacture weapons to pierce Hitler.</p>
<p>The American People Will Not Abandon Joining the Common Defense</p>
<p>Although we in America have not yet made any real sacrifices, we have not suffered aerial bombardment like the brave people of Britain, nor can we imagine the extent of the sacrifices made by the Chinese people in their struggle against aggression and for freedom. We have watched with astonishment as the Russians, over the past four months, have resisted the Nazi war machine at the cost of countless lives and a scorched earth policy. The struggle of ordinary men and women in Europe, from Norway to Greece, against violence is especially admirable. Though violence is strong, it will never be enough to destroy the fight for freedom. As far as the American people are concerned, this effort will not be in vain. The heroic stand of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union will receive the full support of the free people of the Americas. Our people will not abandon their right to join the common defense. Although there are still some industrialists and labor leaders in America who place their private interests above the nation's welfare, and a few who place their petty victories over each other above a great victory over Hitler, and others who place their business interests above national defense obligations, and still others who use their so-called economic policies to force people to accept their demands and deliberately delay the production of defense supplies, these are but a very small minority and do not represent the entirety of American labor and management. The American people have made an unlimited commitment to make the world free, and no individual or group will be allowed to violate this commitment. Defending democratic nations is defending ourselves. This is something American workers know without needing to be told. Those of you who come from occupied countries in Europe and China have told the assembly in detail how you are struggling and persevering, and how unified social progress has been devastated by barbarians.</p>
<p>Urging Workers to Increase Production, Sending Products to the Battlefield Daily</p>
<p>After Germany conscripted its own workers into the army and sent them to the front lines to meet the needs of its total war, it imported about two million foreign civilians into the country to supplement its manpower. The Nazis have turned the occupied territories into slave production sites for their use, and Berlin has become the world's largest slave market. If Hitler wins, what will be the fate of American workers and their free labor organizations? American workers have no doubt about this. They know that their own freedom and the safety of the American people cannot be guaranteed in a world that is three-quarters enslaved and one-quarter free. They also know that we must supply Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with armaments, and we must do so today. Our place in the Nazi plan for world domination, as well as the place of the entire Western Hemisphere, has already been marked on the Nazi timetable. What we must choose now is whether we should make complete sacrifices, actively produce, and send our products to battlefields around the world every day, or whether we should be satisfied with the current rate of arms production, delay making real sacrifices, as the French people did before, and have endless regrets in the future. The former is the choice of those who adhere to reality, who work three shifts a day, actively operate all their machines day and night, and work tirelessly to rush production. The latter is the path of the deluded and those who naively believe they can still negotiate with Hitler. Only in working and struggling for victory must we not forget that our ultimate goal is not just victory. The defeat of Hitlerism is essential, without which there is no freedom. But if we do not prepare for the future now, this war will, like the last war, only produce destruction.</p>
<p>The World Economy Has Been Disrupted; Fundamental Solutions Depend on Cooperation</p>
<p>We are now planning for a better world that we want to create. If the future world is to be one in which peace can exist, then each country must have a more abundant life. There are countless billions of people in the world who do not have enough food, clothing, and housing. If the free people of the world undertake to provide a proper standard of living for these billions of people, then all men and women seeking work can obtain work. We have already begun to study the world's immediate needs after the war, as the world economy has been disrupted by the war. We intend to achieve fundamental solutions, which are to help establish a more stable life. Achieving this goal is not easy and requires the fullest cooperation of all countries in the economic sphere (quoting the Atlantic Charter). We deeply know that social and economic problems, in the international sphere, are like those in the national sphere, not separate and unrelated. In international events, just as in national events, economic policies can no longer be limited to economics. Economic policies are just a means to achieve social goals. There must be no room for the special interests of individuals or nations in the postwar world. At this point, the President again quoted the Atlantic Charter regarding the equal need for commerce and access to raw materials, and continued that the International Labor Organization, with its representatives from both labor and management, and its technical knowledge and experience, will be an extremely valuable tool in planning this kind of international action. Your organization will have a major task in creating stable international systems of social justice for people everywhere. The American people are determined to actively embrace this opportunity and shoulder this historical responsibility.</p>
<p>Praising China's Resistance to Aggression, Displaying a Strong Attitude Towards Japan</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th - According to observers here, several sections of President Roosevelt's remarks to the representatives of the International Labor Organization seem to have special significance for Japan. While U.S.-Japan talks are taking place here, the President, while pointing out and condemning aggressor nations, has never mentioned Japan. However, in his remarks yesterday, the President specifically mentioned China several times, praised its struggle against aggression and for freedom, and promised to actively assist China. This appears to be America's response to Japan's suggestion that the United States should recognize Japan's victory and Japan as the hegemon of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 7th - Yesterday, well-informed circles here considered President Roosevelt's speech to the representatives of the International Labor Organization in New York as "a comforting and practical clarification of America's attitude." These people were especially pleased with President Roosevelt's firm commitment to providing full assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union in their urgent needs. Political circles were deeply interested in President Roosevelt's mentioning the supply of military equipment to China along with Britain and the Soviet Union. They believe this is an indication that the United States will continue its strong stance in the U.S.-Japan talks.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Foreign Journalists, Stresses the Need for Anti-Aggression Nations to Unite, Praises Britain and the United States for Sincerely Assisting China</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently made a statement to dozens of foreign journalists, saying that anti-aggression nations will soon adopt an active offensive to deal with aggressors, and added, "I believe that in the near future, you will see that what I say is true." Chiang Kai-shek emphasized the necessity for anti-aggression nations to unite in military affairs and joint production. Chiang Kai-shek highly praised the assistance provided to China by the U.S. Military Advisory Group and the British and American Economic Missions, saying that this move is one of the strongest foundations for the unity of anti-aggression nations. He stated that the benefits of unity have already been obtained and are quite evident, with several aggressive fronts now merely threatening and hesitating to take action, being nothing more than paper tigers. This is because we are already in an active position, and I believe that in the near future, we can see facts proving the accuracy of my words. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>First Collection of Rare Treasures from the Siku Quanshu Donated to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Central Library, during its preparatory period, was ordered to print the first collection of rare treasures from the Siku Quanshu, and had previously donated several copies to libraries in Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to promote Chinese culture. This spring, it was approved by the Ministry of Education to donate more copies of the first collection of rare treasures from the Siku Quanshu, four copies to Britain, seven copies to the United States, and three copies to the Soviet Union. Most of them have now arrived at their destinations. The University of Rangoon in Burma, the International University in Bengal, and the Imperial Library in Calcutta have successively sent letters of thanks. The library had previously sent a letter of condolence after the British Houses of Parliament were bombed by German planes, with the House of Lords Library also being affected. Mr. Kidd, the Librarian of the British House of Commons, has replied to thank Mr. Chiang, the Director, and expressed his admiration for China's struggle. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Considers Withdrawing Troops Stationed in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced at a press conference today that the U.S. government is currently considering withdrawing the U.S. Marines from Beiping and Tianjin, but he did not know when a decision would be reached. President Roosevelt also said in response to a question that the United States and Japan had never discussed the stationing of U.S. Marines in three locations in China at any time. President Roosevelt avoided answering the question of whether this withdrawal would create a new situation for American residents in China and refused to explain what he meant. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Besieged in Northern Henan, Their Retreat Cut Off; Intense Fighting in the Area of Xinzhongmou and the New Yellow River</h3>
<p>Luoyang - (1) This time, when the Chinese army recovered Zhengzhou, there were a large number of wounded and dead soldiers transported east from the Longhai and Pinghan railways via Kaifeng, and north via Changxiang. (2) Song Mingbin, the battalion commander of the Wuzhi County Special Service Battalion, understood the greater good and led all his officers and soldiers to defect in a village west of Wuzhi on the night of the 2nd. (3) More than a thousand Japanese troops besieged at the Yellow River Iron Bridge, Ba Wang Cheng, and Han Tong fiercely counterattacked the Chinese forces yesterday to cover the Japanese retreat. After repeated battles by the Chinese army, many Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. The Chinese also sent strong units to the rear of the Japanese to cut off their retreat. (4) The Japanese in Zhongmou and southwest of the New Yellow River, unable to escape due to the close pursuit of the Chinese army, desperately tried to escape and launched counterattacks, adding heavy artillery. The Japanese are again crossing the river to the east, and fierce fighting is still underway. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Administration to Revise Measures for Settling Export Goods, Enabling Exporters to Promote Exports</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to sources at the Foreign Exchange Administration, the current measures for guaranteeing the settlement of foreign exchange for export goods will be revised to facilitate export merchants. The current guarantee measures require exporters to have a registered company as a guarantor or to pay cash to guarantee that the foreign exchange earned from their goods will be sold to banks designated by the government. This will be changed so that registered firms can also act as guarantors, and if cash is paid, the amount will be reduced, and reasonable interest will be given. The government will also accept Class A national construction savings bonds for payment. Government officials said that the intention of this move is to facilitate export merchants and thus promote export trade. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Prize Money Increased for Special Prize-Linked Savings</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Executive Yuan recently passed revisions to the measures for issuing special prize-linked savings bonds. It is learned that these measures will change the denomination of each bond from fifty yuan to ten yuan, divided into two strips, each still sold for five yuan. The top prize will increase from 200,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan. Those who do not win a prize will receive generous interest when the principal is repaid at the end of the five-year term. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Director of the China Agricultural Credit Administration Discusses Agricultural Loan Policies</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Qiao Qiming, the newly appointed director of the Agricultural Loan Department of the China Farmers Bank, has taken office. He said that the total amount of agricultural loans from various banks has reached more than 420 million yuan, but the borrowers are landlords who hoard and speculate, and the middle peasants have become rich peasants, while the tenant farmers are being oppressed. Therefore, future loans should be limited to direct producers. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Australian Ships Armed for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 7th - The National Broadcasting Company obtained a radio report yesterday that the Australian government has ordered all ships flying the Australian flag, whether docked in any port or going to any destination, to be immediately armed for self-defense.</p>
<h3>If Japan Ventures to Invade Yunnan, It Will Encounter Immense Difficulties; The Natural Hazards of the Highway Make It Extremely Difficult to Pass; Chinese Defenses Are Exceptionally Solid; Rumors of Clashes on the Yunnan-Vietnam Border</h3>
<p>Hanoi - Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Haiphong. Although some are currently taking trains south, the majority remain in the Tonkin area. While a Japanese advance to the north is not impossible, considering the high mountains and deep gorges between China and Vietnam, which are extremely difficult to traverse, there is reason to believe the claim that the Japanese troops in the Tonkin area are "purely defensive in nature." Moreover, the war has proven over the past four years that the Chinese army has the ability to stop the Japanese army from advancing in this kind of mountainous terrain, which is enough to make the Japanese army hesitant to advance lightly. According to recent news from this area, the transport capacity of the Burma Road is now reaching its peak. Before the Japanese can transport materials to China on the Burma Road sufficient to compensate for the materials previously supplied by the Soviet Union, they may want to cut off the traffic on the Burma Road. Some people claim that if the Japanese want to fight on the plains of Thailand, they must use large vehicles, but if they move north into the mountainous areas, they must use fewer troops due to the difficulty of transport and supply. However, the Japanese may believe that their military strength is sufficient to meet their military needs. Perhaps Japan still does not want to take the final step and cause a total outbreak of war in the East. Undoubtedly, the Japanese have a strong intention to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road within Chinese territory. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Unconfirmed reports today indicate that clashes have occurred 60 miles east of Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. Senior Chinese officials believe that a Japanese attack on the Yunnan-Burma Road would be the most serious and most important test for the ABCD anti-aggression front. However, foreign military experts here have differing views on whether Japan truly intends to strike the Yunnan-Burma Road. Unconfirmed reports claim that the border clashes involved dozens of soldiers, but there are no details. The Chinese side claims that the Japanese army has cleared the ground on the border in preparation for the placement of artillery. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Colonel Sliney and another member of the U.S. Military Advisory Group traveled to Shaanxi at the beginning of the month and have visited Tongguan and other places to inspect the river defenses. The group leader, Major General Magruder, flew to Kunming this morning. This can be seen as the entry of the group's field work into a new stage. The movements of the Japanese army in Vietnam are still being closely monitored here, and at the same time, the defenses on the Yunnan-Vietnam border are constantly being strengthened. People close to the government have always believed that the Japanese aim to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road, but they cannot predict when they will launch the attack because the information received by the government indicates that the Japanese army in Vietnam is not yet sufficient to use, and the air force is even weaker. It is difficult for them to launch an immediate attack. According to Senator Hang Liwu, he agrees with former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's observation that the Japanese army is very likely to attack Yunnan. However, he believes that if the Japanese do this, they will encounter immense difficulties. The treacherousness of the Yunnan-Vietnam Road is one aspect, and the fact that China is well prepared and that the United States will support the protection of the Yunnan-Burma transport to the extent possible makes Japan's every step fraught with thorns. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>The Tokyo Newspaper Hints That Japan Will Invade Yunnan</p>
<p>A newspaper in Tokyo, Japan, today published an article entitled "The Dangerous Highway," discussing Japan's initiative and stating that it is always possible, and perhaps even will happen, that the Japanese army will directly attack the Burma Road. The regular attacks by Japanese planes have greatly damaged the highway, but to achieve a permanent solution, it must be occupied. It also stated that if the Japanese army advances through Vietnam, the United States cannot object, because the United States itself also uses "intermediate routes" to supply Chongqing. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter the Yunnan-Guizhou Border</p>
<p>According to news from Chongqing and Kunming, after a two-month hiatus, 23 Japanese planes suddenly appeared near the Yunnan-Guizhou border yesterday morning. After reconnaissance, they flew back to their base in Vietnam. In the afternoon, another eight Japanese planes, presumably flying from a base in northern Vietnam, flew through Guizhou Province to southern Hunan, reconnoitering Liling, Duyang, and Hengyang. No bombs were dropped on either occasion. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Speech by Soviet Leader Stalin: Reaffirms Determination to Crush Nazis, Gains Stronger Belief in Victory with Aid from Britain and America, Confident that a Second Front Will Be Formed Soon</h3>
<p>Moscow Dispatch from TASS, 7th: Chairman of the Defense Committee, Stalin, delivered a speech on November 6th at the celebration of the 24th anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution held by the Moscow City Soviet of Workers' Deputies, Party Organs, and Public Associations. The original text is as follows: "Comrades, it has been twenty-four years since the success of the Socialist October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet regime in our country. We are now entering the twenty-fifth year of the Soviet regime. The achievements in commemorating the October Revolution in past years have not only increased year by year but have also grown month by month. As for what these achievements are and where their greatness lies, people from all sides, whether friend or foe, know it. However, last year, in addition to being a year of peaceful construction, was also a year of war against Germany, which perfidiously invaded our country. Last year, we were only able to engage in peaceful construction work in the first half of the year, and the latter half, four and a half months, was spent under intense war against Germany. This war has become a turning point in the development of our country. Our peaceful construction work has been sharply reduced, and in some aspects, it has been completely suspended due to the war. We have therefore been forced to reorganize various tasks to meet the needs of the war. We have become a vast rear force serving the front and our Red Army and Navy. The stage of peaceful construction has come to an end, and the stage of the free war against the German aggressors has begun. Therefore, we must now ask ourselves, what were the results of the war in the latter half of last year, or four and a half months? At the same time, what are the tasks we should shoulder in this war of liberation? Regarding the course of the war in the past four months, I have clearly stated in a speech at the beginning of the war that danger is threatening our country. We must understand this point and reorganize various tasks to meet the needs of the war. Currently, as we calculate the results of the four months of war, I must point out that these threats have not only not weakened but have increased. The enemy has occupied a large part of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and other regions. The enemy has broken into the Donets Basin and is threatening Leningrad and our glorious capital, Moscow. The German fascists are plundering our country and destroying the villages and towns built by the joint efforts of our working masses, farmers, and cultural figures. Our army and navy soldiers defend the honor and freedom of the motherland, causing the enemy to bleed like a river. They courageously repel the enemy's fierce attacks and repeatedly establish heroic achievements, but the enemy, regardless of losses, spares no soldiers' blood and continues to drive fresh troops to the front to fill the ranks of the fallen soldiers, making a desperate gamble with all their strength, hoping to conquer Leningrad and Moscow before the arrival of severe cold, as they know that winter will be unfavorable to them."</p>
<p>Great Achievements in Four Months of War: German Casualties Exceed Four Million</p>
<p>"In the four months of war, our side suffered 350,000 deaths, 378,000 missing, and 1,020,000 wounded. During the same period, the enemy suffered 4,500,000 deaths, injuries, and missing. Undoubtedly, after four months of war, the rate of decline in German reserve manpower is more severe than that of the Soviet Union. When they first attacked our country, the German fascist aggressors believed that they could "end" the Soviet Union in one and a half to two months and reach the Urals in this short period. The German side did not shy away from its plan for a "lightning victory" over the Soviet Union. Currently, this insane plan must be considered a complete failure. The "blitzkrieg" that was invincible in Western Europe has collapsed on the Eastern Front. Why is this so? At the same time, what was the basis for the German fascist strategists claiming that they could "end" the Soviet Union and reach the Urals in two months? Their estimate was primarily based on the dream of forming an anti-Soviet alliance and enticing Britain and America to join. The method was to first intimidate the rulers of those countries with the "revolutionary devil" to prevent them from approaching the Soviet Union and isolate the Soviet Union. The German side is good at exploiting the contradictions between various countries and various classes, as well as the contradictions between various countries and the Soviet Union. They know that this policy has been effective in France because the French rulers have been frightened by the "revolutionary devil" and are willing to place their country under Hitler's iron heel. The German fascist strategists believed that they could apply the same trick to Britain and America."</p>
<p>Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Establish a United Front: Alienation Strategy Becomes Increasingly Futile</p>
<p>"Hess was sent to Britain by the German fascist regime with the aim of enticing British politicians to participate in the war against the Soviet Union. However, Germany's estimate was completely wrong. Although Hess has done his best, Britain and America have not only not joined hands with the fascist aggressors to attack the Soviet Union, but have united with us to deal with Hitler's Germany. At the same time, the Soviet Union has not only not been isolated but has also gained allies from Britain, America, and several countries in the German-occupied areas. In fact, Germany's policy of exploiting others' contradictions has exhausted its tricks and is completely unsuitable for the new situation. Not only that, but this policy has also placed the German aggressors in a precarious situation. Under the new situation currently created by the war, the results of this policy will be contrary to what they expected. Secondly, Germany was unstable, believing that once the Red Army suffered heavy losses, the workers and peasants would clash, disturbances would occur everywhere, and the country would disintegrate, thus assisting Germany in smoothly reaching the Urals. However, in this regard, Germany has also miscalculated. The adversity encountered by the Red Army has not weakened but has strengthened the unity of the Soviet people. Not only that, but they have also turned all the nationalities of the Soviet Union into an indestructible military camp to assist the Red Army and Red Navy in combat."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Fights for Justice: National Army and People are United and Consolidated</p>
<p>"The Soviet rear has never been as stable as it is now. If it were another country, after encountering territorial losses, it would be very likely unable to sustain itself and would be eliminated. Since the Soviet system has experienced such a major test and has made its rear even more stable, this system is obviously the most stable system. Finally, the German aggressors excessively trusted the weakness of the Red Army and Navy, believing that the German army and navy could defeat the Red Army in one fell swoop and directly enter our inland. However, in this regard, the enemy has also miscalculated. They have overestimated themselves and underestimated the strength of our army and navy. Undoubtedly, our army and navy have less experience. They have only been fighting for four and a half months, while the enemy has been fighting for two years. Although the morale of our army is higher than that of the German army because they are defending their motherland and fighting for justice. The German side is engaged in aggressive warfare, plundering other countries, and disregarding right and wrong. Undoubtedly, since our army is fighting for justice and defending the motherland, it will inevitably create heroes. On the other hand, the German army is now using plunder as its combat objective, and it will inevitably produce plunderers without any spirit. Secondly, the deeper the German army enters our inland, the farther it is from the German rear and the more difficult it is to fight in an unfavorable environment. Soviet guerrillas destroy the enemy's rear and shatter the enemy's confidence in consolidating its position. On the other hand, the Red Army has the support of the entire Soviet people, and there is no need to worry about the supply of manpower and materials. Our army is stronger than the German side expected, and the weakness of the German army is also unexpected by them. All this is due to this reason. In the defense of Leningrad and Moscow, our army destroyed thirty German divisions, thus producing new talents in the army, navy, and air force. They will inevitably become a trouble for the German army in the future. Undoubtedly, all this can predict the inevitable failure of Germany's "blitzkrieg strategy" on the Eastern Front."</p>
<p>Fighting Alone in Adversity: Hope for the Establishment of a Second Front</p>
<p>"In some respects, the Red Army is in an advantageous position, but it is also in an unfavorable situation. The reason why the Red Army is temporarily encountering adversity is because of the lack of a second front against Hitler in Europe. Currently, there are no British or American troops fighting against the German fascist troops on the European continent. Therefore, the German side does not need to disperse its forces to fight on both the eastern and western fronts simultaneously. In other words, since the German side believes that there is no worry in the West, it is attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength and uniting the forces of its allies. The current true situation is that the Soviet Union is independently waging a war of liberation against Germany, Finland, Romania, Italy, and Hungary, without receiving any military assistance from anyone. The German side has repeatedly boasted about its temporary achievements and has hyped up its army, saying that as far as the army of one country is concerned, Germany will definitely be able to defeat the Soviet Union. But in fact, such boasting is extremely empty, as Germany has now had to rely on the assistance of the armies of Finland, Romania, Italy, and Hungary, while the Red Army is still fighting alone."</p>
<p>"The lack of a second front in Europe has reduced the German army's concerns. There is no denying this. At the same time, if a second front can be built in Europe (we firmly believe that this will become a reality in the near future), then the Red Army's position will definitely improve and be unfavorable to Germany. There is also no doubt about this. In addition, another reason for our army's temporary adversity is the lack of tanks and aircraft. In modern warfare, it is very difficult for infantry to fight without the assistance of tanks and sufficient aircraft. In terms of quality, our air force is actually better than that of the German fascists. Several Soviet divisions have even won the honor of fearless warriors, but their quantity is not as large as that of the German side. As for our tank units, although they also surpass the enemy in terms of quality and combat, their quantity is several times less than that of the enemy. These are all secrets of Germany's temporary victory. However, our tank production has not decreased. Our tank manufacturing industry continues to supply the front with excellent tanks, but German tank production is several times higher than ours. The enemy is not only actively manufacturing tanks in its own country but also using factories in Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and France to accelerate production. If it were not for this, the Red Army would have already defeated the German army, because due to the courage of our resistance, the German army never dares to fight without tanks."</p>
<p>Comparing Hitler to a Cat and Napoleon to a Lion: A Band of Rogues Vying for Hegemony</p>
<p>"As for Hitler and Napoleon, we can compare them to a kitten and a lion. Napoleon fought against reactionary forces with advancing forces, while Hitler is using reactionary forces to fight against advancing forces. The people of Europe will definitely rise up against Hitler's hegemony. Only Hitler does not know this. Who does not believe that the Soviet Union, Britain, and America will provide the people of Europe with assistance and wage a war of liberation against Hitler's hegemony? Secondly, what is the situation in the German rear? The Hitler Party was able to gain the support of the German people because it claimed to eliminate the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles and restore Germany. However, after this problem was solved, the Hitler Party embarked on the path of imperialism and aggression against Europe and the Soviet Union, making the German people the enemy of the public. The attitude of the German people has now greatly changed. They oppose the war and deeply hope for an immediate end to the war. Not only the European rear but also the German mainland rear has formed a volcano that is about to erupt and bury Hitler's adventurers in it. Regarding this point, only Hitler's foolish followers do not know it. Finally, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have formed a whole front and have decided to make the defeat of Hitler's imperialist elements the goal. Modern warfare is actually a motor war. The side with a higher motor production can win the victory. The total amount of motors in Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States is three times that of Germany. This is one of the main reasons for the inevitable defeat of Hitlerism."</p>
<p>Britain and America Provide Substantial Assistance to the Soviet Union: Join Hands to Carry Out the War of Liberation</p>
<p>"The recent Three-Power Conference in Moscow has decided to supply our country with tanks. As everyone knows, we have begun to receive assistance in tanks and aircraft. In addition, the United States has recently decided to lend the Soviet Union $1 billion. We dare to say that the alliance between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States is indeed well-deserved, and this alliance will continue to strengthen. Our first goal is to liberate our territory and people from the German fascist system. At the same time, we must assist the Slavic and other European peoples in their struggle for liberation against Hitler's tyranny so that they can regain their freedom of life and not be interfered with in their internal affairs by others. But in order to achieve this goal, the military strength of the German aggressors must be crushed. The German aggressors who broke into our country and attempted to enslave our people must be completely destroyed. But in order to implement this task, our army and navy must receive the assistance of the whole country. Therefore, our workers must supply the front with more tanks, aircraft, and artillery. Our farmers must supply the people and industry with various agricultural products and raw materials as much as possible. At the same time, our entire country and all Soviet nationalities must unite and carry out the war of liberation side by side with the army and navy, destroy the Hitler troops, and win freedom and honor for our country. This is our current task. We can and must complete it, because only by completing this task and defeating the enemy can we obtain lasting and true peace. For the liberation of all oppressed people and for the complete destruction of the German aggressors, we wish the friendship of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union to last forever, and may our Red Army and Navy live long, may our motherland live long, we are fighting a bloody battle for justice, and victory will belong to us."</p>
<p>U.S. State Department Announces $1 Billion Loan to the Soviet Union for Purchasing Military Supplies, Repayable in Ten Years, Interest-Free During the War</p>
<p>Washington Urgent Dispatch from the United Press, 7th: The State Department announced yesterday that the United States has lent the Soviet Union $1 billion. The State Department stated that President Roosevelt wrote to Stalin on October 30, agreeing to lend the Soviet Union $1 billion. Stalin replied on November 3, accepting and expressing his gratitude, stating, "This loan will greatly help us in our arduous resistance against our common enemy, the homicidal Hitlerism." The loan will not require interest or principal repayment during the war. Interest and principal repayment will only be required five years after the end of the war. Part of the loan will be paid in raw materials and goods. The State Department disclosed in President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin that U.S. military supplies have already been shipped to the Soviet Union in quantity. The loan can be repaid within ten years. It also stated that the United States is extremely grateful for the work done by Stalin and his staff during the Three-Power Conference in Moscow. The letter further solemnly stated, "The elements discussed at the conference will be implemented as much as possible within the scope of feasibility."</p>
<p>Soviet Revolution Anniversary: Pan Youxin Holds Tea Party, Chairman Chiang Personally Visits to Congratulate</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch, 7th: Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin held a tea party at the embassy at 11 a.m. on the 7th to entertain guests from various countries to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Director Shang Zhen, personally visited the embassy at 10:30 a.m. to congratulate him. In addition, present were Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor Lattimore, British financial and economic delegation leader Niemeyer, U.S. anti-malaria group leader Haas, U.S. Ambassador Gauss, British Ambassador Kerr, Belgian Ambassador Guillaume, Australian Minister Eggleston, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Gan Naiguang, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Weizhi, Ma Chaojun, He Yingqin, Feng Yuxiang, Guo Taiqi, Chen Lifu, Sun Ke's representative Situ De, Cheng Qian, Xu Yongchang, Lu Chao, Zhang Jia'ao, Pan Gongzhan, Dong Xian'guang, He Guoguang, Wu Guozhen, Wang Pengsheng, Yang Jie, Guo Moruo, and more than 200 reporters from various countries. Ambassador Pan personally greeted the guests, and the hosts and guests were exceptionally happy.</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch from the Havas Agency, 7th: The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association will hold a commemorative meeting at 2 p.m. tomorrow to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, welcoming people from all walks of life to participate, and will screen movies to entertain the guests. The president of the association, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, recently published an article entitled "Wishing the Soviet Union Victory in the War of Resistance" to celebrate. His strategy stated that the Chinese people can best understand and sympathize with the mood of the Soviet people in commemorating their National Day today. The Soviet Union, like China, stands on the front line of the anti-aggression camp. Soviet victory not only protects the survival and freedom of the Soviet people but also protects the survival and freedom of countless peace-loving and justice-minded people around the world. The Soviet Union's war of resistance is linked to the bright and dark future of the world. Therefore, in addition to congratulating the Soviet Union on its National Day today, we cannot but wish the Soviet Union victory in the war of resistance. But we must also understand that the wars in various places are now connected as one. Anti-aggression countries must coordinate the overall situation and kill the enemy. China's counter-offensive power has gradually grown and will be able to cooperate with the anti-aggression front and fulfill its greatest responsibility. Britain, after this cruel experience in the European war, will be able to take further joint action with the anti-aggression countries. The United States will also be able to strengthen its economic blockade against Japan while aiding the Soviet Union and give Japan a head-on blow at the appropriate time so that it cannot cooperate with the Axis powers' plan to echo each other from east to west.</p>
<p>Lin Sen and Roosevelt Send Congratulations to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Chongqing United Press, 7th: Chairman Lin Sen sent a telegram to Soviet Chairman Kalinin, congratulating him on the anniversary of the October Revolution, stating, "Your country and our country are currently on the same front, fighting for freedom and justice."</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch from the Havas Agency, 7th: President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram to Soviet Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin, congratulating him on the 24th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The text reads, "I firmly believe that the sacrifices of bravely resisting aggression will be achieved."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations Before Price Controls are Implemented</h3>
<p>For years, the citizens of Shanghai have suffered from the manipulations and hoarding, which is beyond description. Eventually, due to the special circumstances, it is necessary to expect the Shanghai Municipal Council, which is responsible for municipal affairs, to temporarily take on the responsibility of general administration, crack down on hoarding, regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihood, and achieve the ultimate goal of maintaining social security. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Council, following its usual legislative procedures, has obtained the approval of the Consular Body for new bylaws, which are expected to be implemented soon. According to newspaper reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council's measures in this regard will, at a minimum, include investigating the inventory of goods to be controlled, tracking their origins and destinations, and setting official retail prices, in order to clear the air of speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, and prevent prices from soaring like a kite on a string. It is hoped that life will be stable for a while, and the international market can maintain its original function without collapsing.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of administration lies not in obtaining the form, but in matching the name with the reality. Being able to benefit the majority of people is good governance; if the benefit is enjoyed by a few, and the burden is nominally borne by many, taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, then good governance becomes bad governance. Moreover, merchants are only interested in profit, and hoarders are only interested in goods; having seen the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice maintaining price stability in a stable market, and also seeing that when market prices rise or fall excessively, they are either concealed by those in the industry, or abandoned by those in the industry, concealment deprives the public of their supply, and abandonment deprives the procurement of its basis. Therefore, it is said that control should not allow for exceptions, and prices should not allow for discrepancies; the same item should have the same price everywhere, and different grades should have different values; if there is both the Shanghai Municipal Council's publicly sold rice and merchants' privately sold rice, and there is also rice of the same grade but different prices being sold together, then there is no wonder where the problems arise from. Moreover, within the various strata of Shanghai society, there are vaguely forces opposing the authorities, causing those who are law-abiding and content to be hesitant to step forward, and reporting is also useless. Dishonest merchants are adept at fraud, not only towards their customers, but also towards all parties, if they cannot transcend personal interests, and cannot overcome their personal desires and material lusts, who will not be tempted and deceived, and those who were originally intended to be cracked down on may even become their protectors, and those who were originally intended to seek the welfare of the people may instead cause the people to suffer, such inversions are common, but it is also because they are not clear-headed!</p>
<p>However, things cannot be generalized. Merchants who deeply understand the overall situation never consider the actions of unscrupulous merchants to be right, but are hindered by their business relationships and cannot take measures to clarify and correct. Therefore, we deeply hope that the implementation of this decision to control prices can obtain the cooperation of merchants in various industries who are discerning and fair, standing on the position of commercial ethics and proper business operations, so that price controls can achieve practical results without losing the profits they deserve in their business. However, the necessary understanding of price control: (1) For goods that supply foreign exchange, merchants must not be allowed to use the intangible black market rates of exchange, and speculative hoarding to set prices based on the market ratio of items such as US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, gold, and cotton yarn. But if such a black market still exists, the practice of speculation and manipulation cannot be eliminated, and the doctrine of profiteering will penetrate deep into people's hearts, inevitably causing the goods supplying foreign exchange to still be constrained by it, and become a major problem for people's livelihood. (2) Import merchants or manufacturers should directly sell goods to retail stores, and the quantity should be based on the average monthly sales of each store in recent months as a quota; then the amount of goods allocated should be proportional to the amount sold. In other words, retail stores should temporarily become consignment shops, and the original agency (or sales or contractor) contracts of various factories within the concession should be canceled, in order to achieve direct production (or importer) sales, eliminating the accumulation and manipulation of middlemen, or the gradual flow of goods into the hands of hoarders. (3) All store inventory, warehouse inventory, factory inventory, and hoarder inventory of each item before the implementation of control shall be registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council by the owners within the shortest possible time, and then the Shanghai Municipal Council shall separately prescribe its sales methods. Some may think that it would be appropriate for the Shanghai Municipal Council to directly purchase and sell them, but they do not consider that it is not appropriate for the Shanghai Municipal Council to directly bear the business responsibility of certain commodities, so as long as it supervises that there is no more manipulation and hoarding, restores normal transactions, and achieves free circulation, that is enough! As for concealing and failing to report, and rewarding whistleblowers, the Shanghai Municipal Council will naturally have its own methods, and there is no need to discuss it further. (4) Judging from the past commercial deceptions and concealments, it is really difficult to prevent the supplied goods from being hidden and exploited; because the accounting records often have discrepancies and are not entirely credible. If the market is calm, and prices in one place are consistent, and there is no profit to be made, then there is no need to use its malpractices. But in today's situation of soaring prices, if the restrictions are too strict, stores can use all kinds of malpractices to counteract them, or use counterfeit goods, or mix goods, or claim to have no goods, or sell to the most profitable channels, or change the retail unit, or change the measuring instruments. All of these will make consumers suffer unbearably, and have to reluctantly comply and collude to conceal. This makes it difficult for the government to crack down due to lack of justification, and difficult to intervene due to lack of evidence, eventually leading to de facto laissez-faire, and treating the laws as useless. (5) During the control period, all daily necessities are sold directly by manufacturers or importers to retail merchants, the market prices are uniform, and there are fixed rules for entry and exit, so there is no need for a spot market to discuss market conditions and circulate goods, trying to create a fait accompli, so that even if the Shanghai Municipal Council wants to suppress it, it will eventually be helpless. In fact, the Shanghai Municipal Council is determined to seek the welfare of the public, and will not tacitly approve the prices created by speculation and manipulation as natural or due. Currently, all kinds of prices are divorced from the actual sales effect, and are driven by the greedy ambitions of hoarders, as well as the instigation of the black market exchange rate and the black market gold price, using a small amount of materials and the competition of many people, holding back and not releasing, hyping it up and soaring wildly. The serious and profound suffering of the millions of wage earners in Shanghai is all due to this, how can it be regarded as a normal market price. How can the Shanghai Municipal Council be ignorant of this situation, how can it enter its trap and use it as the base price for the official price, there is absolutely no reason for this. We believe that the most fair and just method for the Shanghai Municipal Council to set prices this time is: 1. Based on the Shanghai prices before the United States and Britain implemented the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds. 2. Based on the price calculated from the foreign exchange supply. The Stabilization Fund recognizes that some cases can be considered for the number of foreign exchange applications for the import of essential goods before August 18 that have not been approved, and even supplements the necessary subsidies to maintain trade. From this, it can be seen that the price regulation in Shanghai should use this as the standard, there is no need to doubt it; if it is the opposite, then there is reason to suspect it. (7) The sale of daily necessities must be based on the principle of universal application; once the purchase quantity is restricted, it should not be restricted by time, location, and availability of goods (this is naturally a separate matter in extreme situations where goods are absolutely scarce). If the method of sale is not good, it will originally be intended to suppress and stabilize people's minds, but it will instead promote panic. Recently, the sale of publicly sold rice in various rice stores, this store today, that store tomorrow, there are many who seek it, but few who respond, the more difficult it is to obtain, the more those who want to obtain it become eager. As a result, as soon as the public hears that there is publicly sold rice for sale, thousands of people gather, squeezing and falling, whipping and kicking, willing to endure the pain to wait, and finally return empty-handed. The peddlers who take advantage of the situation for profit are not worth regretting, but every household is waiting to be fed and cannot obtain it, it is truly pitiful. As for how to crack down on concealing and reselling, that is another matter, it is not possible to prevent its malpractices by tightening the purchase quantity of each person; and "sold out" cannot be considered as fulfilling its responsibility. (8) Therefore, the distribution system is the most complex; it may work well elsewhere, but it cannot be implemented in Shanghai; because Shanghai has neither the preparation nor the conditions for this. But the Shanghai Municipal Council should know that the community is diverse, the strata are uneven; the living standards are different, the purchasing power is very different, and the number of family members varies. In the past, Tao Yuanming bowed for five dou of rice, but now it is not easy to get five dou of publicly sold rice, it is not that the people of today and the past are different; the environment is different, and the pressure of life is truly lamentable. Therefore, the sale of daily necessities is beneficial to disperse, not to concentrate, and convenient for the needs of the public. In the past, running a charity sale was not for the purpose of making profit, changing the low selling price, compensating for labor costs, although the quantity was limited, still a dozen or twenty places were set up throughout the city to facilitate trade, how thoughtful was its intention. Now the public sale of rice is not as charitable as that, it is priced according to its cost, there is no reduction, and those who sell it, the merchants profit, the rice shops profit, and it is sold to the households, it is still a normal transaction. Therefore, the government supplies foreign exchange in order to maintain the food supply of the entire Shanghai, and there should be an appropriate supply to meet the eager demand of the public. How can the public be made to give up what they want and seek what they do not want, pay an unreasonable price, and maintain their rightful survival. Therefore, the technical aspects of the public sale of rice should not be used as a basis for preventing peddlers, nor should it be abandoned due to choking, and not plan to improve it. Regardless of what kind of daily necessities, it is appropriate to measure its nature, plan its sales method, and in general, it should adapt to the purpose of the appropriate survival of consumers, plan its application convenience, and not allow insiders and outsiders to hoard it away. However, in today's soaring prices, importers may not be stained, manufacturers may not all benefit, wholesalers may not all be profitable, and the benefits are all taken by the hoarders and large and small retail wholesalers! Leaving aside paper cigarettes, matches, and soap, gasoline is 5.2 yuan per gallon, and kerosene is 11 yuan per gallon on the market. In terms of quality, kerosene is inferior to gasoline; in terms of need, gasoline is far less universal than kerosene; however, the price of kerosene is twice that of gasoline, and even more. One is that import companies manage it themselves (but there is also a black market), and the other is that merchants and hoarders are allowed to set the price themselves. Oil is oil, kerosene is a mass fuel, its high market price is ignored, this is why the strictness is different, probably because kerosene is exclusively for the use of the general public, and the calls are not easily heard by the foreign companies. But wool mills and rubber factories have already publicly expressed their adjustment of sales prices, hoping not to be manipulated by hoarders. If this is a semi-finished product, it should also take into account the output of processing and manufacturing, (1) can we not be manipulated by the manufacturers; (2) even if the manufacturers are not manipulated, can we not be hoarded by agents and retailers, and consumers cannot benefit from it. In order for price controls to be effective, both governance and people management are needed, so the organization of investigation and audit must be strict; it should be valued for its execution with a spirit of meticulousness, sharpness, rigor, fairness, familiarity with commercial conditions and people's suffering, not being emotionally driven, nor being swayed by power, but also having human sympathy, so that it can truly feel the pain of the people and wholeheartedly seek the welfare of the people.</p>
<p>Now, before the implementation of price control, we express our sincere expectations, and hope that it can live up to the people's fervent expectations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu Arrives in Manila, Discusses Mission to the United States, Aims to Promote Peace, Kurusu Also Visits American and Filipino Dignitaries</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 7th - Saburo Kurusu, the Japanese special envoy to Washington, arrived in Cavite this afternoon, welcomed by the Japanese Consul General Niina and other Japanese representatives. President Quezon's representative, Benitez, was also present. After a brief rest at a hotel in Manila, Kurusu officially visited President Quezon. He then returned to the hotel to meet with reporters, saying that both US Secretary of State Hull and he agreed that the less said about US-Japan relations at the moment, the better. A reporter asked if he had brought a letter to President Roosevelt. Kurusu replied that he was not a messenger, and if one letter was enough, why send another envoy? The sole purpose of this trip is to assist Ambassador Nomura in the United States. Kurusu also said that he and Hull had reached an agreement on one point, but he would not disclose anything about it at this time. When reporters asked him to talk about other points, Kurusu replied that he did not know, and that it had to be discovered in Washington, not in the Philippines. Reporters continued to ask questions. Kurusu replied that he was going to the United States on a special mission, not to fight, but to assist Ambassador Nomura. Ambassadors always have their missions, and the work of an ambassador is to promote peace. Kurusu also announced that he had flown from Taiwan to Macau on a military plane, and from there took a ship to Hong Kong, and then immediately took the clipper ship here. After entertaining reporters, he held a tea party, attended by the US representative to the Philippines, Sayre, the US Navy Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, Hart, Philippine President Osmena, and prominent American, Filipino, and Japanese figures. Kurusu had a pleasant conversation with Sayre and Hart. Kurusu will take a clipper ship to San Francisco at dawn tomorrow.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 7th - It is learned here that Yuki, the chief of the Third Section of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is accompanying Kurusu to Washington. It is said that both Kurusu and Yuki are among the most outstanding experts in the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so their trip may focus on restoring normal trade relations between the United States and Japan.</p>
<h3>Another Japanese Ship Sinks off Vladivostok, Soviet Mines Floating, Endangering Navigation, Japan Sees it as an Extremely Serious Issue</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - According to a report from the Hokkaido office of the Japanese News Agency, the Hakune Maru (3,000 tons) sank last night near Cape Kamui, opposite Vladivostok, but the cause of the accident was not specified. It is now known that 17 people died, 5 are missing, and 14 were rescued. This is the second Japanese ship to be involved in an accident in two days. According to a message received by the Governor-General of Korea at 1:00 PM today, 110 people are still missing after the "Kehi Maru" sank after hitting a mine two days ago. It is reported that a total of 281 people were rescued, but 20 of them have already died. When Navy Minister Shimada reported on the circumstances of the sinking of the "Kehi Maru" to the Cabinet, he said that from August to October 4, Japanese naval patrol boats had discovered 69 Soviet-made floating mines in one area of Korean territorial waters.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - When Foreign Office spokesman Ishii received foreign journalists this morning, he was asked about the sinking of the Japanese ship "Kehi Maru" off the coast of Korea after hitting a floating mine. Ishii claimed that Japan's patience was almost exhausted. We do not trust the sincerity of the Soviet Union, or that the Soviet Union wishes to be friendly to Japan, but we are now doubtful of its sincerity regarding the floating of mines due to Soviet carelessness. Japan has now taken all kinds of actions that have been discussed regarding this case. He meant that the United States would also support Japan in terms of the principle of freedom of the seas. When asked if Japan sincerely supported this principle, Ishii firmly replied of course. Ishii also said that the Soviet Union has continued to try to curb the danger of mines, but in view of the situation, it is still necessary to take the necessary precautions.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Implements New Regulations to Stabilize Legal Tender, Legal Tender Transactions Suspended This Morning, Gold and Silver Exchange Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - As a result of the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, trading in Chinese legal tender was completely suspended this morning. There were no transactions on the black market. The Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange, which has always traded legal tender, opened its doors this afternoon to consider everything. Although the authorities have not yet issued an order to close the exchange, according to well-informed sources, forward trading of legal tender must be conducted according to official prices, and the black market will automatically disappear. After the authorities announced the buying price of legal tender as 473 yuan and the selling price as 469 yuan, the market was quite chaotic for a while, because there is a huge amount of legal tender in Hong Kong. Now, anyone who wants to exchange legal tender must first obtain a permit from the Stabilization Fund. The Stabilization Fund must verify that it is for genuine commercial use, not for speculation, before issuing the permit. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - After the Foreign Exchange Control Office announced the new regulations on the holding of legal tender and foreign exchange transactions last night, the black market for legal tender here was closed this morning. According to the new regulations, the following three types of activities are illegal: (1) Any foreign exchange transaction involving legal tender without a permit; (2) Buying or selling goods in Hong Kong with legal tender without a permit; (3) Holding, obtaining, paying, importing, or exporting legal tender without a permit, except for authorized or registered banks (Chinese and foreign banks and major money shops) which may engage in foreign exchange transactions. All foreign exchange transactions such as telegraphic transfers or drafts must be subject to the official exchange rate of 473 yuan for buying and 469 yuan for selling. If a business currently has more than 20,000 yuan in legal tender, or an individual has more than 5,000 yuan, and registers before November 14, they will be allowed to hold, obtain, pay, export, or import legal tender. A statement issued by the Hong Kong government stated that in order to dispel public anxiety about the free use of legal tender, it has been suggested that before the situation is adjusted, applications for the export of legal tender will be approved without questioning, and that the extraction of up to 1,000 yuan of legal tender per month from legal tender accounts will be allowed without a permit. These new regulations were promulgated in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of the Chinese government and the Stabilization Fund, and can assist in the implementation of the Chinese government's monetary policy. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Financial Secretary Gu Yiqun issued a statement today regarding the new regulations adopted by the Hong Kong government on legal tender exchanges: The adoption of this regulation is in cooperation with the National Government to help maintain the stability of legal tender, and is the result of close and harmonious cooperation between the two governments, but various considerations should be given to the legitimate needs of banks, trade interests, and holders of small amounts of legal tender. The National Government welcomes this regulation, which makes a significant contribution to the implementation of China's monetary policy. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Speculation in Yarn and Cloth Fluctuates Greatly, Margin Requirements Will be Increased Due to Increased Volatility, Extra Yarn Delivery is Relaxed Due to Excessive Squeezing</h3>
<p>The yarn market has seen a turnaround, due to the decline in gold prices, public apathy, and profit-taking by bulls across the board, so the market has become more relaxed. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory singles fell by 30 yuan to 3,120 yuan, but the securities firms rushed to the market to sell, which made the market more bearish. At the same time, futures also fell, leading the cloth to return downstream, so floating positions became more active, and the market gradually fell to 3,025 yuan. However, as soon as the low price appeared, certain major players were unwilling to give up on the bulls, and bought in at the low price, gradually rising to 3,080 yuan, but gold remained weak, and was still weak at the close, with a price of 3,025 yuan. The trading situation was quite lively.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation opened weak following the factory singles, and prices fell uniformly. However, buyers of 10-count coarse yarn were very enthusiastic, and the market became firm instead. It is unknown why general hoarders do not buy fine yarn, but only absorb coarse yarn, so the recent situation is that coarse yarn is tight and fine yarn is loose. The trading volume in half a day was only 380 bales, with prices down 20-30 yuan for coarse yarn, and 80-90 yuan for fine yarn.</p>
<p>The market was quite weak in the afternoon, saying that gold continued to fall, futures yarn fell, and the leading cloth also softened, so public sentiment was depressed, and it is expected that the opening will be low today.</p>
<p>The Double Horse Exchange Office convened a liaison meeting with the industry yesterday afternoon, and intended to expand the scope of business. Since the previous repeated limit-up and limit-down, there have been too many. Now it is thought that the policy should be changed, and all 23-count and 20-count packaging produced by all factories in Shanghai will be uniformly graded and can be delivered. In this way, it can avoid squeezing the shorts and squeezing the longs. If the review is completed, trading will be carried out as usual next Monday.</p>
<p>Since the 20-count Double Horse yarn and factory single speculative market has been suspended for more than a week since the repeated limit-down and the settlement price of 2,370 yuan between the long and short sides, the reporter has learned that the Yarn Guild Broker Exchange Conference has decided to reopen next Monday (November 10). The limit-down and limit-up will be 160 yuan per piece of yarn (double the standard of 80 yuan before the settlement price). The black market has already posted a black board, notifying the industry and customers. And the banks in the Securities Building will also double the margin for each customer's speculative transaction of cotton yarn (originally only 100 yuan per bale, then changed to 200 yuan, and now it must be 400 yuan) to avoid risk. However, future speculative customers will have to double their capital, and the number of speculators will be reduced compared to before, and the cotton yarn chips for speculative targets may be wider than before. The interest of speculators has been reduced. However, future speculative factory single trading is truly doable and not doable. (Komatsu)</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market went from flat to down, with a sudden and fierce decline. Since the new contract, the market price has soared greatly, and general buyers have made a profit at this new peak. In addition, the news from abroad is more moderate, and the gold market has fallen sharply, once entering the 20,000 yuan mark, so the yarn market is weak, and there is a lot of profit-taking, and mixed yarns are also weak, resulting in a situation of oversupply. The opening of October was still firm at 3,030 yuan, up 5 yuan slightly. Later, due to the decline in cash, it also turned weak. The December contract was 3,050 yuan, down 50 yuan. The January contract was 3,140 yuan, down 38 yuan. After entering, there was no return. The closing price was down 60-70 yuan to nearly 100 yuan. The market was still threatened by sellers in the afternoon, and the trend was very weak, so it continued to fall one after another. The near-term contract once fell to 2,828 yuan, the December contract also fell to a low of 2,940 yuan, and the January contract fell slightly to a low price of 3,050 yuan. Later, due to a slight replenishment of floating positions, it rebounded slightly. The result was a uniform drop of 120-130 yuan to 196 yuan. A list is shown below:</p>
<p>Coarse and Fine Cotton Flannel Markets Differ in Condition</p>
<p>The current cotton situation has loosened along with the gold price, but fine cotton flannel is still firm, and coarse cotton flannel is slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Brazil 100 pieces 1350.0 Public Great Advance</p>
<p>Also 100 pieces 1298.0 Colleague Advance</p>
<p>Also 100 pieces 1330.0 Also</p>
<p>Also 300 pieces 1280.0 Also</p>
<p>Rangoon 100 pieces 730.0 Also</p>
<p>Also 100 pieces 726.0 Also</p>
<p>Also 100 pieces 720.0 Also</p>
<p>Also 100 pieces 714.0 Also</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was unstable and sporadic, rising first due to buying by the industry and short covering, then falling back due to continuous selling by Southern parties and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, the closing price, except for the spot price, which rose by 2 points per pound, fell by 5-6 points per pound.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose first due to lower cotton crop estimates and large short covering, and then fell again due to sales by European exporters and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, yesterday's closing price still rose by about 1-2 rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open lower by half a rupee today.</p>
<h3>Coarse and Fine Cloth Each Fall by 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory cloth continued to weaken, due to profit-taking by colleagues and hoarders. However, the market rebounded slightly later. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 2-5 yuan. The factory prices of bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged, and hand goods fell by 3-5 yuan. 16-pound Butterfly, a variant of coarse cloth, fell by as much as 10 yuan. The trading volume in this street alone was large, totaling more than 500 pieces.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth showed signs of weakness at the opening, but rose after falling due to the firm rise in gold prices. Ultimately, the selling pressure from the industry was strong, and the decline continued. The leading fine cloth factory singles opened in the morning at 118 yuan, and fell to 115 yuan. The smallest price in the afternoon was 108 yuan, and the closing price was slightly higher at 114 yuan, a sharp drop of about 10 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Sijunzi Chibi closed late at 3.97 yuan, also a terrible drop of 2 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>The Market for Small Package Rice Declines Significantly</h3>
<p>The imported rice market, after a brief rebound earlier, has weakened again due to sluggish sales. Speculative trading has become difficult, relying solely on actual sales for support. Early market trading saw buyers seeking to offload holdings due to poor sales, but sellers were initially reluctant to lower prices, buoyed by the previous day's momentum. The market remained relatively stable, with No. 1 Saigon rice opening at $195.50 and $195, No. 2 at $185, and Java rice at $190. No. 2 Siam rice was particularly strong due to dwindling supply. Many shops, concerned about counterfeit small package rice from the Public Works Department (PWD) sales, switched to other varieties, making No. 2 Siam rice the most sought-after medium-grade option. It opened at $175-176, then $173.50. Small package rice opened at $165-166. However, due to weak sales, the market could not sustain the initial prices, and all grades gradually declined. Closing prices were as follows: No. 1 Saigon at $192, Medium Grade at $189, No. 2 at $182-$180, No. 1 Siam initially at $190, then down to $185, No. 2 at $175, Java Long Grain at $187-$188, Min-to initially at $186-$187, Medium Grade at $182, then down to $179, Broken Rice initially at $137-$138, then down to $133, all down by $2-$3 from the previous day. Small package rice, with practically no sales and no speculative interest, suffered a sharp decline, closing at $160-$159, a drop of $6-$7, a truly significant event.</p>
<p>The Yinghua Company (1 picul 2.5 pecks) fine-grain rice also fell by $2-$3, from $200 to $197-$198. 13,000 bags of spot goods were traded, along with 400-500 tons from the Yinghua Company. The overall market trend was downward, influenced by sales from hoarders and the continuous arrival of cheap small package rice in Shanghai. More shipments are expected soon, and new deals are being negotiated. Coupled with bearish rumors, the future prospects appear bleak.</p>
<p>Due to scarce arrivals, thick and thin glutinous rice varieties saw limited sales volume but firm selling intentions from owners, resulting in a price increase of $2-$3. Early Southern Port rice broke $205, then down to $202. Kunshan new glutinous rice was at $206, special grade at $208-$209, Qingjiao kiln seed rice at $104-$105, Six Species at $206, and Dujian at $190.</p>
<p>The supply and demand for glutinous rice remained balanced, showing no significant ups or downs. Hong Kong glutinous rice initially opened at $220, then down to $218, special grade at $222, green glutinous rice at $204-$205, Jindan New National rice at $209, and Qingjiao New Shade rice at $197.</p>
<h3>The Market for Imported Flour Gradually Weakens</h3>
<p>The imported flour market remained weak. The fall in rice prices has dampened speculative interest, and the PWD's public sale of cheap flour is also being planned. As a result, street sales are slow, and speculative hoarding is limited. Off-market trading is sluggish with little activity. Kan Flour's Golden Dragon brand was once offered at $57 but found no takers, later offered at $56 but still with poor sales. Consequently, prices are down by $1.50 from the previous market. Wheat bran prices are stable, with wheat arrivals scarce and prices firm.</p>
<h3>Reduced Off-Market Trading in Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market trading in miscellaneous grains decreased slightly due to sluggish actual sales and limited buyer interest, causing the market to soften. Da You Factory clear oil was reportedly sold at $280, rapeseed oil at $273, Ri Hua Factory rapeseed oil at $270, Tai Shan Factory rapeseed oil at $267, Changzhou Cowhide Yellow at $109.50, Dutch Yellow Corn at $50.05, white corn at $48, Saigon new corn for October shipment at $95.50-$95, and for November shipment at $95.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Soar Excessively, Triggering a Sell-Off from Tianjin Dealers, Resulting in a Sharp Drop of Over $1,700</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for spot gold bullion experienced a dramatic plunge, with prices breaking below the $20,000 threshold. Market sentiment was uniformly bearish, primarily because the recent surge in prices had been excessive, exceeding Hong Kong gold prices by over $3,000 and Tianjin gold prices by an even greater margin. Tianjin dealers had already shipped 4,200 taels to Shanghai the day before, which securities firms heavily sold. Some cash shops and banks also actively sold, while other banks continued to acquire gold, temporarily pushing prices up to $21,100. However, the market soon reverted to a selling trend, and after hitting a low of $19,200, it entered a consolidation phase, ultimately falling by $1,710. Over 10,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Jewelry gold also fell by $150 to $2,020. Silver shops resumed posting prices for standard silver at $28, a rise of $6. Today, Saturday, the Shanghai Joint Exchange Market will open at 9:00 AM and close at 10:30 AM to facilitate cash settlement for members.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Breaks Below $20,000 Threshold</p>
<p>The spot gold bullion market opened with a uniform selling pressure, with buyers hesitant to enter. As a result, the opening price was already down by $810, at $20,600. Tian Yuan and Shun Yuan advanced and recovered to $900. Heng Ji, De Fu, and Da Feng sold, sharply falling $450 to $20,450. Ming Feng and others suddenly started buying, and Tian Yuan also bought, pushing the price up $650 to $21,100. Tianjin dealers then began a massive sell-off, and De Fu and others also sold, creating a severe market imbalance. Prices plummeted $1,400 to $19,700. Ming Feng returned with aggressive buying, and Da Feng and others also absorbed supply, causing an immediate surge of $750, reaching $20,450. At noon, Tian Yuan sold off, causing another decline, with the noon close at $20,100. In the afternoon, buyers were hesitant, and the market opened $900 lower at $19,200 due to continued selling pressure. De Cheng and Yong Cheng aggressively bought, causing a surge of $600, and Cheng Ji and others sold off to $19,500. Xiang He and De Fu then aggressively bought again, pushing the price up to $19,950. Heng Ji and others sold off, pushing it back down to $19,500. Shi He and Da Feng then absorbed supply, raising the price to $19,850. Tian Yuan sold off, with the closing price at $19,700, a sharp drop of $1,710 compared to the previous day's closing price. There was a $1,900 range throughout the day. The retail price for gold bullion at cash shops was around $20,000, with the buying price being $1,000 lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down $150</p>
<p>Jewelry gold retail prices were lowered three times in the morning by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, down by $120. In the afternoon, it was lowered by another $30 to $2,020 (buying price reduced by $150), a total decrease of $150.</p>
<h3>New York Telegraphic Transfers: Numerous Sellers Seeking $4, Pound Sterling Plummets by $40</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC posting stable rates. Black market rates for British and American currencies remained slightly weaker, owing to renewed rumors of unrest between China and Japan. The British pound was offered outside the customs area at 2 shillings, and a Chinese speculator sold thousands of pounds to an importing firm at 2 shillings 1.25 pence. There were numerous sellers of Chinese currency at $2.875, while importing firms offered $3 and $3.25. Numerous sellers sought $4 for New York telegraphic transfers, as these funds were reportedly frozen upon arrival in New York. The market softened further at noon, then quieted down again in the afternoon. The closing rates at 4:00 PM were 2 shillings for the British pound and $3 for the American dollar, slightly weaker than the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds plummet by $40, following the sharp drop in spot gold prices. British gold notes also fell by $3. American gold notes re-entered the $40 range, briefly falling to $38.70 before recovering to $39.30, but still down $1 from the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell sharply by $0.50. Japanese and Korean gold notes also weakened, with the former falling to $3.88 and the latter to $3.79.</p>
<h3>Slight Increase in Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>The off-market trading of government bonds was firmer yesterday, mainly due to short covering following the fall in gold and cotton yarn prices, leading to stronger market sentiment. Class C bonds even broke the $6 mark, but selling by Sichuan dealers in the afternoon dampened enthusiasm. However, if Sichuan dealers do not continue to sell, it is unlikely to see a downtrend in the near term. Class D bonds are scheduled for the twelfth drawing on the 10th, so the market will be ex-lottery from today. In the morning, Xin Feng, Lian Yi, and Sheng Xing were buyers, while Tong Kang, Tong Shun, Sen Chang, Lian He, and Jiu Feng were sellers. Class C bonds briefly reached $6, then recovered. In the afternoon, sentiment was quite positive, with Xie Xing, Yuan Shun, Tai Ding Kang covering positions, and Run De and Yi Chang also buying. Class C bonds reached a high of $62.50, then experienced selling by Sichuan dealers, with Bao Long, Tong Kang, Tong Shun, and Jiu Feng continuing to sell. The market was slightly weaker at closing, with prices generally rebounding by $0.03 to $0.07. Approximately $1.8 million worth of bonds were traded. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Two hundred shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at $170 each.</p>
<p>The stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce continued to be lively, with new prices appearing amidst strong buying pressure. The market softened slightly at the close. Yarn mill stocks were no longer the focus of attention and are unlikely to remain strong, likely due to excessive gains in previous days. Rubber stocks saw increased buyer interest, with high prices difficult to secure. Although prices also retreated slightly at the close, most prices remained significantly higher than the previous close.</p>
<h3>The Price of Sugar is About to Decline, When a New Horder Buys</h3>
<p>The sugar market in the morning continued to fall due to excessive floats and some market sentiment favoring the shorts, so the decline was even more severe. In the afternoon, new hoarders took advantage of the low prices to absorb the goods, and the prices recovered. The company's futures for 24 Raw White were at the $293 limit down in the morning. In the afternoon, the market opened at $275, closed at $84, with a high of $91 and a low of $73. The 20th date opened at the $301 limit up in the morning. In the afternoon, the market opened at $315 and closed at $26, with a high of $30 and a low of $15, a fall of $32 to $13. Spot goods for 24 Raw White for October delivery were initially at $306, then suddenly fell to $280, then to $95. In the afternoon, the price rose to $312 due to multi-party absorption, slightly down to $01 in the middle, and then rose again to $20, and then down to $05. September was at $280 to $315, down $09. August was at $275 to $310, down $11. July was at $275 to $300, down $10. Hong Kong Raw White fell sharply to $260 in the morning, and recovered by $20 in the afternoon to $2780, which was still $9.50 lower than the previous day. Dutch Red was at $238 to $65, down $05. Taikoo car White B Mark was at $200, and $315 in the afternoon, up $05. HX Mark was at $280, $300, up $15. A total of more than 38,000 packages of futures were traded, and more than 29,000 packages of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Continued Rise in Dried Seafood</h3>
<p>The price of Ningbo seafood, dried cuttlefish and dried octopus, has continued to rise recently. Goods from Zhoushan have reached $550, Yantai goods at $540, Ningbo goods at $360, and dried Ningzi at $800.</p>
<h3>Chestnuts (Continued from October 13th)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>There are probably not many discussions and records about eating chestnuts before the Tang and Song Dynasties. Du Fu's poem has a sentence "Steamed Chestnuts Warm in Mountain Homes"; Tao Gu, a person from the early Song Dynasty, also said in the Qing Yi Lu he wrote: "Prince Jin - Li Keyong - once pursued the Bian army fiercely, - Zhu Quanzhong's soldiers - the grain transport was endless, steamed chestnuts to eat: the army then called the ticket Hedong grain." From this, we can know that people in the Tang Dynasty would eat "steamed chestnuts". Mei Yaochen of the Song Dynasty, Yin Yang Wei Geng Chuanhui's poem about new chestnuts, has a sentence "Wild people meet in cold study, mountain stove night fire artillery": probably putting chestnuts in the stove to burn them, just like the "pop chestnuts" we call now. The real way to eat "fried chestnuts" also originated in the Song Dynasty. Lu You's Notes from an Old Scholar's Studio said: "The former capital - Bianjing - Li He fried (same as stir-fried) chestnuts, and was famous in all directions. Others tried every means to imitate it, but in the end they could not match it. In Shao Yu, Chen Fugong... was sent as an envoy to Yanshan, and suddenly two people came to offer ten bundles of fried chestnuts each... they praised themselves and said: "Li He's son!" Shed tears and left." He also has a poem Feeling about Eating Fried Chestnuts at Night "The roots of the teeth are floating and sighing at my decline, mountain chestnuts are fired to heal night hunger", which can also prove this statement (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Food Rice and Foreign Exchange Lending; Monthly Supply of 250,000 Bags; Total Value Approximates 40 Million National Currency; Monthly Foreign Exchange Allocation of US$1 Million for Coal</h3>
<p>Mobil Kerosene Temporarily Suspended Sales Due to Speculation by Resellers</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of Public Works Department Chairman Riddell and American Director Missler going to Hong Kong to negotiate the foreign exchange needed for imported goods, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from authoritative sources yesterday that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is extremely concerned about the food situation of Shanghai citizens. It has now been decided to provide a maximum of 25,000 tons per month, i.e., the foreign exchange needed for the import of 250,000 bags of rice, with a total value of approximately US$2 million. Calculated at the Exchange Equalization Fund's rate of 5.34375, the amount is close to 40 million National Currency. Therefore, the food situation of Shanghai citizens can be considered stable in the future, and its prospects are becoming brighter. As for the foreign exchange needed for the import of flour, wheat, and coal, the two representatives of the Public Works Department are discussing it with the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is reported that there is hope for a monthly allocation of US$1 million for coal.</p>
<p>Flat Rice Sales Points Set Up Inside Police Stations</p>
<p>It is now known that the French Concession authorities have reiterated their previous order that anyone who does not have a special permit from the police department is not allowed to transport rice out of the Concession. However, this ban does not apply to rice heading to the Public Concession. If anyone is found to have violated this ban, the French police department will immediately confiscate the rice. Furthermore, according to a report from the Dazhong News Agency from responsible sources yesterday, regarding the Public Works Department setting up two flat-price Hong Kong rice sales points to facilitate purchases by citizens, it is now actively underway. Public Works Department Director-General Frelippe met with two qualified rice merchants yesterday who had applied to the Public Works Department to be responsible for the rice sales and inquired about everything. If everything goes smoothly, it is hoped that it will be established and start selling rice next Monday. It is heard that the location will be temporarily assumed by the police station within the Public Concession, but this statement has not been confirmed by the authorities. The Public Works Department is also scheduled to hold a flour flat-price committee at 2:00 PM on the 10th to discuss flour prices.</p>
<p>The Insurance Industry Has Acquired Foreign Exchange Profits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Insurance Industry Association sent representatives to Hong Kong to seek foreign exchange for insurance premiums and submitted requests to the Hong Kong office of the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is heard that a solution has been negotiated. The representatives have completed their work in Hong Kong and have already set off to return to Shanghai. As for the content of the agreed-upon solution, according to news from Hong Kong financial circles, it is roughly as follows: (1) The insurance company or its branch that obtains foreign exchange due to insurance relations must be registered with the Chinese government and located in Shanghai, and the insured person must be of Chinese, British, or American nationality. (2) The foreign exchange income and loss compensation of the insurance company, regardless of its net profit, must be provided to the Exchange Equalization Fund. (3) The foreign exchange supply is implemented at the end of each half-year, and the situation of the first half-year is checked before permission is granted. (4) When the net profit for each period accounts for more than 20% of the insurance premium income, 20% of it can be supplied with foreign exchange. If the net profit is less than 20%, all of the net profit can be supplied with foreign exchange. (5) When paying foreign insurance premiums, they should be calculated in legal currency at the official price. (6) Foreign exchange can be provided when paying overseas insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Price Meetings Held Daily</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession continued to hold meetings yesterday to manage the price issue. It is reported that the Public Works Department has meetings almost every day this week in the conference room of the General Office to prepare for the implementation of price management and seek practical and effective methods. Some hoarding and profiteering merchants have expressed shock at the joint efforts of the Public Works Department and import merchants to suppress prices. Furthermore, James, the owner of the famous American Jimmy's restaurant and nightclub in the city, stated this morning that he is willing to contribute a powerful weapon to stop hoarding and profiteering by turning his Silver Capital Night Garden into a retail store from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, selling items only at the lowest profit of 10% or 20%.</p>
<p>Mobil Kerosene Temporarily Suspends Sales</p>
<p>Mobil Oil Company suddenly suspended the retail sale of kerosene this morning, causing hundreds of people wanting to buy kerosene to flock to Mobil Oil Company on Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road. Among them were hundreds of poor Russians and other Westerners, and about 400 Chinese. The traffic was obstructed. The company tightly closed its iron gates, so the masses could not enter. According to an employee of the company this morning, the company decided to stop door sales to avoid disturbances and because there were many abuses in the retail method. It was heard that someone purchased a can of kerosene from the company for $52, but when they took it elsewhere to sell it, they could get $80. This is obviously a profiteering behavior, so it was decided to stop it. The public can still buy Mobil kerosene from the company's distribution points in various places. It also stated that if the Public Works Department does not take preventive measures, it is feared that the same hoarding of kerosene will occur.</p>
<p>People's Organizations Support Control</p>
<p>Lide Fraternity and other people's organizations, the Public Works Department has petitioned for authorization to manage prices and organize an importers' association, and issued a joint declaration of support and urged early implementation to relieve the people's suffering, stating roughly: Since Shanghai became an isolated island, idle capital has gathered and speculation has become rampant, resulting in rising prices, but never has it been so severe as in recent times. This not only poses a serious threat to the lives of citizens, but also poses a great danger to social stability. Now that the Public Works Department has seen the seriousness of the situation, it has resolutely taken on the arduous task of rescuing the people, and all enlightened Chinese and foreigners should sincerely support it. After the joy of our company, we briefly express our views.</p>
<p>(1) Proceed Quickly: The Public Works Department has often been slow to balance prices in the past, accommodating the facts, causing it to be taken advantage of by speculators. In the future, it is necessary to quickly go to work and do everything possible to benefit the people, and it is possible to make decisive decisions. (2) Eliminate Speculation: The Public Works Department should immediately close all speculative markets within the boundary, cut off the source of fuel, and eliminate the den of speculators. At the same time, for hoarding merchants, the provisions of the Anti-Hoarding Merchants Regulations can be invoked and severe punishment can be imposed, so that selfish and treacherous merchants know how to be cautious. (3) Assess Prices: Organize a strong and perfect evaluation mechanism, investigate the cost of all daily necessities, such as food, fuel, medicine, cloth, edible oil, soap, matches, etc., and assess reasonable selling prices, which must not be exceeded.</p>
<p>(4) Investigate Inventory: Quickly investigate the quantity of goods in each warehouse and the names of their owners in detail. If there are goods stored by people outside the industry, or if the goods stored by people in the industry exceed the normal level, they should be taken over and distributed fairly according to their purchase price, and sold in the market. We also hope that all wage earners in each industry will publicly publish the cost of all goods in their industry at any time for the evaluation agency to refer to and avoid being deceived by cunning people. (5) Encourage Whistleblowing: Citizens should assist the authorities to investigate the cost of all items in each industry and the names of those who hoard and speculate, and report in detail. Citizens should be encouraged to blow the whistle.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department, with its transcendent position, is still rescuing us from our suffering. We, the citizens, should work together to overcome difficulties and dangers. Do not only seek personal gain and disregard the future of the country and the nation. Do not help the trend and hope to fish in troubled waters. It is important to know that the Shanghai market has today because of the government's supply of foreign exchange. If we cannot understand the government's painstaking efforts to maintain it, the last thing we can do is to endure the pain of cutting it off. Those who hoard and speculate will inevitably reap what they sow. All goods, how can they not be seized by the violent? Then, regardless of rich or poor, we will all perish together. When the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to? May our citizens think about it for a long time. It is heard that the City Thrift Movement Committee also advised merchants in various industries yesterday to work together to curb the unreasonable rise in prices.</p>
<h3>Deputy Chief of the Japanese Police Department Decided to be Succeeded by Watanabe, Will More Actively Participate in Police Affairs, Japanese Proposals Will Continue to be Discussed</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department and the Japanese side have reached an agreement on police negotiations, that is, to appoint Watanabe as the Deputy Chief of the Public Works Department Police Department to succeed Akagi, who was assassinated on June 17. Watanabe arrived in Shanghai on August 24 to succeed Akagi's vacant position. It is heard that he will be more actively involved in the administrative affairs of the Public Concession Police Department than Akagi. At the same time, regarding the Japanese proposals to change the Public Concession Police Department, the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities will continue to discuss them soon. However, the details of future discussions or the changes requested by the Japanese side are not known.</p>
<h3>Xu Songyao's Corpse Exhumed for Examination Yesterday; Chauffeur's Coffin Also Transported Simultaneously; No Accurate Information Yet on the Outcome</h3>
<p>Xu Songyao, the eldest son of Jia Ding native Xu Xiangsun, owner of the Huamei Pharmacy at 26 Bo Shi Road, was fatally wounded by his younger brother, Xu Daquan, with an axe and died despite medical treatment at the Mae Long Hospital. His family initially concealed the matter tightly. When news later leaked, it caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. The French police began investigating, first having Xu Songyao's coffin lifted from the Chinese Funeral Parlor a week ago and transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang for placement. The day before yesterday (Thursday) morning, the French police sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the Dahua Funeral Parlor to lift and transport the coffin of Zheng Xiangda, the chauffeur, to the Tongren Fuyuantang. That same afternoon at 4:00 PM, both the Xu and Zheng coffins were sent together to the small sickroom on Terrace Road, awaiting exhumation and examination. Xu Daquan, the perpetrator who axed Xu Songyao to death, was sent to a mental asylum after the incident. It is now reported that yesterday afternoon, detectives dispatched by the French police arrested Xu Daquan at the Red Cross Hospital on Route Ghiglieri.</p>
<p>After Negotiations, Entry Was Finally Granted</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the bodies of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur were exhumed for examination at the mortuary on Terrace Road. To ensure accuracy, this newspaper dispatched a reporter to investigate. When the reporter arrived at the mortuary and attempted to enter, he was stopped by the gate guard. After the reporter negotiated, a staff member of the mortuary took the reporter's business card. Moments later, he came out and told the reporter to wait a bit before being allowed to enter. The reporter had no choice but to stand and wait outside the gate. After about twenty minutes, more and more reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers arrived. After further negotiations with the mortuary authorities, they finally agreed to allow reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers to enter.</p>
<p>Photography Prohibited; Viewing Denied</p>
<p>At this time, the two coffins of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur were already placed in the small sickroom of the mortuary. Xu's coffin was placed on two long benches, while the chauffeur's coffin was placed on the ground. This newspaper's photographer attempted to enter and take photographs but was stopped by mortuary personnel, who prohibited photography. At approximately 2:30 PM, the deceased's family members and relevant parties arrived and successively entered the small sickroom, after which the exhumation and examination began. Reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers also attempted to enter to observe but were again denied entry by mortuary personnel at the entrance to the small sickroom. Later, Chinese and Western newspaper reporters attempted to send two representatives to enter and observe, but this was also disallowed, and the door to the small sickroom was closed.</p>
<p>Waited a Long Time; No News</p>
<p>The reporters had no choice but to stand in the plaza outside the small sickroom, waiting for news after the exhumation and examination. About half an hour after the exhumation began, a staff member suddenly came out of the small sickroom, shouting for workers from the Shanghai Funeral Parlor to enter and temporarily close the coffin lids. At 4:00 PM, the examination was reopened. The reporters waited until about 5:00 PM and then inquired with relevant parties about when the examination procedures would be completed. They were told that the examination procedures were quite complicated and would take a long time.</p>
<p>Chauffeur's Family Extremely Taciturn</p>
<p>Because it was getting late, and the lights in the mortuary and on the roads were all lit, the reporters returned to their offices. The details of the exhumation and examination of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur's bodies, as well as the causes of death, remained unknown. At the time, there were hundreds of citizens outside the mortuary's main gate attempting to enter to observe, but they were all prohibited from entering by the gate guards. At that time, the reporter attempted to investigate everything with Mr. Zheng, a member of the chauffeur's family, but Mr. Zheng remained extremely taciturn and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Guangci Hospital Doctor Participated</p>
<p>According to another report, Xu Songyao was injured on the 21st and died at 4:00 PM on the 26th, while the chauffeur Zheng Daxiang died on the 24th. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the exhumation and examination took place. In addition to the French police requesting Dr. Shang Deli (transliteration), a prominent doctor from Guangci Hospital, to participate in the examination, Xu's elder sisters, Jihua and Xihua, also arrived on the scene. Jihua wore a light green coat and a dark green cheongsam, while Xihua wore a light yellow coat and a black cheongsam, accompanied by Tu Kaiwei, the manager of Jicheng Pharmacy. In addition, two staff members from Huamei Pharmacy were present. Only Jihua and Xihua were allowed to enter during the examination.</p>
<p>Xu Songyao Had Several Injuries</p>
<p>According to the latest news from relevant parties last night, the results of the examination of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur's bodies showed that Xu Songyao had several injuries. The chauffeur's body was dissected by the forensic doctor, and his stomach and intestines were removed for forensic examination.</p>
<h3>Approaching the National Father's Birthday; City Prepares to Celebrate; Promote Local Work to Show Reverence; The Day After Is the Fourth Anniversary of Shanghai's Fall</h3>
<p>November 12th is the National Father's birthday anniversary. All sectors of the city are preparing to celebrate it enthusiastically. November 13th is the fourth anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. It will be commemorated with solemn and respectful emotions, as a painful memorial. The concession authorities are implementing security measures starting yesterday to ensure public safety. The details are reported by a Daguang News Agency reporter as follows:</p>
<p>National Father's Birthday</p>
<p>November 12th is the National Father's birthday anniversary. Due to the special environment of Shanghai, the city's residents have decided to follow the memorial methods for extraordinary times, stopping extravagant celebrations. According to the flag-hanging methods agreed upon by various groups and the two concession authorities, national flags will be hung uniformly on this day for one day. All institutions, organizations, factories, and schools will also follow the usual practice of taking a holiday to celebrate. Citizens from all walks of life, to revere the National Father's revolutionary spirit, have decided to intensify the promotion of the fundraising campaign for winter clothing and to step up efforts in frugality and disaster relief to demonstrate the Shanghai citizens' utmost concern for the country and their compatriots.</p>
<p>Anniversary of the Fall</p>
<p>November 13th is the fourth anniversary of the National Army's withdrawal and the fall of Greater Shanghai. Because of the special situation, all sectors are unable to hold commemorative ceremonies, so they have unanimously decided to conduct a solemn spiritual commemoration. All compatriots in the city recall the loyalty and courage of the soldiers who fought bloody battles in Songhu four years ago today, as well as the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life who destroyed their homes to relieve national difficulties. This further increases their determination to strive for strength, with the spirit of enduring hardship and learning lessons from experience, working hard and inspiring themselves, striving to be promising, vowing to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, working hard, supporting national policies, and remaining unwavering.</p>
<h3>Highest Coal Price Actually Exceeds the Thousand Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the coal market became even more rampant. Indian smoked coal was fiercely raised to 1,040 yuan per ton, which is shocking. There is a market for coal briquettes, but there is no supply. The prices of other kinds of smoked white coal have been continuously raised. These unusual transactions are all operated by a group of coal profiteers. The Coal Industry Association has failed to stop and thoroughly investigate these illegal transactions, which is disappointing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval Fourth Fleet Establishes Anniversary Today</h3>
<p>The U.S. Naval Fourth Fleet will hold a grand dance party at the Naval Youth Association today to celebrate the 166th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. Naval Fourth Fleet. At that time, the Fourth Fleet's band will play music, and a huge "birthday cake" will be presented in the evening, led by Mrs. Oliver, chairman of the American Women's Association, and McDonald, an officer of the Fourth Fleet. The dance party will be held in the gymnasium there, decorated with lights and colors. Because there are concerns about the large number of guests, participants must reserve seats in advance.</p>
<h3>Entrance to Manila Bay Is Now Being Equipped with Mines; Military Exercises Conducted Simultaneously in Coastal Areas; Area Within Fifteen Kilometers Is a Danger Zone</h3>
<p>It is said that the US President Lines' mail ships traveling the Far East route have recently suspended their voyages to Manila. According to sources in the shipping industry, this rumor is due to a recent notice issued by the Philippine authorities stating that the entrance to Manila Bay will be equipped with mines from the 1st to the 30th of this month. At the same time, military exercises must be conducted in various coastal areas of the Philippines, stipulating that the area within fifteen kilometers of the coast is a danger zone. Ships traveling in this area should pay special attention during this period. The US ships have temporarily suspended their voyages as a precautionary measure. It is also reported that the Hong Kong authorities have also notified the shipping companies of various countries sailing between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila to be aware of this.</p>

<h3>Request to Suppress Charitable Lottery; Authorities Have Not Studied It; Christian Groups Believe It Is Gambling; But Many Poor People Rely on It for Relief</h3>
<p>Representatives of twenty Christian groups recently jointly sent letters to the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Concession's Conseil d'Administration, requesting the suppression of the charitable lottery. The letter stated briefly that lotteries are a type of gambling, and the nature of all gambling is no different from theft, because it seeks to obtain other people's money without working for it. Lotteries not only cultivate gambling habits among the people but also generate a spirit of theft. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to suppress charitable lotteries in the two concessions, and if necessary, to appeal to the law.</p>
<p>The reasons for submitting these applications can be divided into three points: (1) Lotteries are gambling, which is extremely harmful to morals and the people, especially the Chinese. In principle, issuing lotteries is no different from setting up gambling dens. However, the poison of lotteries is more widespread, because its vicious influence also extends to the homes of countless people who never enter gambling dens. Issuing lotteries is to scrape up the money of many people and give only a portion of it to a few. (2) The laws of China, Britain, and the United States all stipulate that lotteries are illegal. Shanghai should follow this highest moral standard. (3) Christianity does not want to use funds obtained by destroying the morals of the people to support Christian charities. The religious groups that jointly applied include the China Inland Mission, the American Methodist Church, the Bible Society, the Baptist Church, Muir Church, the Salvation Army, and the American Presbyterian Church, etc. Also, the English-language "China Press" said that the authorities in this city will ignore the church groups, the so-called "Christian Crusade," that are seeking to abolish the refugee lottery.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Magre, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, who told reporters this morning (the 7th), the charitable lottery was legally established, and the church groups' opposition has no reason. Mr. Magre also said that the French Consulate-General in Shanghai granted the lottery the right to issue, and sent a manager to supervise the lottery drawing and other matters. The charitable lottery staff also expressed disagreement with the church groups' application, saying that since the charitable lottery was established in August of the 27th year, until the end of August of this year, it has distributed more than 1.7 million yuan to various charitable organizations. The Salvation Army, which participated in this application, also received 4,000 yuan in charitable lottery surplus from the French Consul-General in November. Municipal Council officials refused to make any comments on this, only saying that the bureau is currently focusing on the city's serious food situation. According to the application letter from the church groups, the signing representative is headed by Mr. Rankin. Mr. Rankin recently sued the "North China Daily News" for publishing lottery advertisements.</p>
<h3>Concealing Foreign Rice; Store Owner Detained; Sentencing Set for the 10th</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council sold out of foreign rice, countless poor people are suffering from a lack of daily meals. Recently, they have been trying to rescue the hungry people and distribute hundreds of dan of stored foreign rice to designated rice stores in various districts for sale to temporarily maintain the situation. However, the Dafeng Rice Store at 409 Route Au Tou, obtained 20 bags of foreign rice from the Municipal Council the day before yesterday. On the morning of the 6th, they put up a sign for sale. Hundreds of poor people nearby rushed to buy it, causing a great deal of crowding. After a while, the rice store said it was sold out, and removed the foreign rice sign issued by the Municipal Council, but there were still dozens of poor people who had not bought any. They had to disperse separately. At that time, Hua Butou Zhang Wenjun happened to be patrolling and entered the store to investigate. He found five bags of rice. The bag skins were the store's own, which aroused suspicion. He opened them and saw that they were all foreign rice sold by the Municipal Council. He questioned the store owner, Xie Zhengming, a native of Nanjing, but he was vague and claimed that they were kept for the store's staff to eat. The Butou knew that he was cunning and trying to profit. He immediately seized the five bags of rice and took the store owner Xie to the Putuo Road police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution on the charge of deception under Article 32, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce. The judge ordered that he be detained and set the sentencing for the 10th of this month. Bail was not allowed.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Postman to Solicit Wine Money; Stealing by Opportunity</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a Chinese man wearing a postman's uniform went to a Westerner's home to solicit wine money. After the Westerner gave him the money, he left. Later, he discovered that a watch and 30 yuan in legal tender had been stolen. Recently, similar thefts have occurred in the French Concession. In the future, residents in the concession should pay special attention to strangers who enter their homes under various pretexts to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<h3>Cook Commits Murder; Chops Four Members of the Employer's Family; Chen Shen's Injuries Were Too Severe and She Died</h3>
<p>Chen Yinlai, a Tianjin native, 51 years old, his wife Chen Shen, 48 years old, his eldest daughter Ciheng, 21 years old, and his youngest daughter Yingfen, 13 years old, lived together at 43 Cihui Lane, Route Foch. Chen recently made a lot of money doing speculative business, so the family was well-off. He hired a Tianjin native, Wei Zhang (42 years old), as a cook. Yesterday at about 6:00 PM, the cook, because his request for a pay raise was not granted, suddenly used a sharp blade to chop all four members of Chen Yinlai's family. Chen was chopped in the back of the head, and his wife, Shen, was chopped in the right ear, with a wound about three inches deep. The two daughters were injured in the head and hands. They were taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Chen Shen's injuries were too severe, and she died before she could be treated. Chen's injuries were also quite serious, and his life was in danger. The two daughters suffered lighter injuries. The murderer was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station for processing.</p>
<h3>Hardoon's Estate; British Office Sends Staff to Manage; Affairs of Hardoon &amp; Co. Are All Suspended</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" said that after Mrs. Luo Jialing Hardoon passed away on October 3rd, the various parties were competing fiercely for her vast estate, and two wills were in contention. The British Office in China has not yet formally heard the case. However, Hardoon's estate is lacking managers, resulting in the unpaid rent of more than 1,600 tenants, more than a hundred employees of Hardoon &amp; Co. requesting pay raises, and the matter has not been resolved. Payments have been suspended. Therefore, after the lawyers representing various parties negotiated, they requested the British Office to send someone to temporarily manage the estate. Sir Mosso, the British Registrar, then appointed McMath and Hartman, the chief accountants of the Kerzner &amp; Co., this morning (the 7th) as the Hardoon Estate administrators during the litigation period.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Consul in Shanghai; Car Robbed</h3>
<p>M. Miguez, the Brazilian Consul in Shanghai, accompanied by his wife, took a Ford car, license number 吏字九號, driven by a chauffeur, to the Grand Cathay Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road to see a movie at 9:00 PM the night before last. After Mr. and Mrs. Miguez got out of the car, they walked into the theater. The driver parked the car near Park Road. At about 9:45 PM, while the driver was dozing in the car, three robbers suddenly got into the back of the car. One of the robbers drew a pistol and struck the driver's head, forcing him to drive west. The driver, under the threat of a gun, had no choice but to obey and drive. When the car reached the vicinity of Xiaoshadu Road, the robbers drove the driver out of the car, and one of the robbers sped away. Afterwards, the chauffeur ran to report to the owner and reported the matter to the competent police station, requesting investigation. It was heard yesterday that the robbed car had not yet been found. Recently, cases of stolen cars in this city have been increasing. There are about ninety cars reported to the police station for investigation. However, the car of a diplomatic officer being robbed is still unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller's Attempted Extortion Fails; Assaults Passenger; Plaintiff Does Not Want to Pursue</h3>
<p>Ni Yubiao, a ticket seller on the English-owned Tram Company's No. 1326 tram, and Qin Fusheng, a door opener on No. 143, on the No. 6 tram at 11:50 AM on the 19th of last month, became angry and violent because their attempt to extort the fare given by passenger Zang Fugen failed. At Guangdong Road near Fujian Road, they actually beat up Zang, causing multiple injuries. The Laozha police station was reported, and the two persons Ni and Qin were accused of injury by the First Special Court, and they have been summoned once. Because the plaintiff was not present, the order was changed to another date. Yesterday morning, the trial was continued in the Fifth Criminal Division by Judge Zhan Liangce. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, said that the plaintiff had been summoned to the case by the police station today. Zang Fugen said that the defendant, Ni Yubiao, had now asked someone to reconcile with him, and he did not want to pursue the matter because the defendant's mother was old and his wife's father was sick in bed, making the situation pitiful. Judge Zhan then announced that the case would not be accepted.</p>
<h3>South Goods Store Fraudulently Obtaining Material; Manager and Staff Fined</h3>
<p>The prices in this city have risen to the extreme, and the general merchants are still sparing no effort to exploit heavily, reducing the amount of weight. The situation is extremely hateful. On the 5th of this month, the Gonghexiong South Goods Store at 686 Avenue Edward VII deducted seven taels from the ten pounds of sugar purchased by Russian Piero. Piero discovered the matter and reported it to the police station, which transferred the summons to the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, the manager of the store, Shao Shuhan, and the staff member, Zhang Zhitang, were summoned to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the details of the case and prosecuted them for the crime of fraud. After a clear interrogation by Judge Zhan Liangce, it was decided that Shao and Zhang were jointly guilty of obtaining illegal benefits in property by fraudulent means, and each was fined 200 yuan as a warning.</p>

<h3>Chen Yinglin's Invention: Scientific Abacus; Ministry of Education Orders All Schools to List as a Required Subject</h3>
<p>(Kunming Airmail) Chen Yinglin, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant residing in Burma, noted that since the invention of the abacus in China during the Han Dynasty, it had undergone modifications during the Tang and Song Dynasties, flourished during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, but had declined since the Republic of China era. This was because scholars did not delve deeply into its study, and the government provided little promotion. As a result, this calculating tool, invented thousands of years ago, had not been improved or advanced. It could only calculate integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and could not perform more complex calculations or handle more intricate matters, making it difficult to adapt to modern needs. Chen Yinglin, therefore, dedicated himself to research, applying scientific perspectives and methods to strive for improvement, enabling it to calculate compound numbers, fractions, squares, cubes, and more to meet current demands. He spent three years and over ten thousand Burmese currency units, meticulously studying and reforming the mechanism, finally achieving success. It was named the "Chen's Abacus," and it was registered in Burma, India, and other places. It was also recognized by friendly people from India and Burma as being better than mechanical calculators, praised as a new invention in academic circles, and widely adopted. This summer, Mr. Chen returned to China and submitted his remodeled models and the Chen's Abacus instruction manual to the Ministry of Education for review and filing. He also received a certificate of merit and a bonus of fifty thousand yuan from the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(Construction) The construction of this new type of scientific abacus consists of a total of twenty-five columns, which is equivalent to combining two ordinary abacuses. The middle column serves as the basic unit, and it is then divided into left and right sections, allowing for the simultaneous calculation of multiple different units of currency and numbers. Moreover, the calculation is swift and without any delays. Within the horizontal bar of the abacus, there is a table listing integers, compound numbers, decimals, fractions, complex fractions, area, volume, and angles, etc. At the right end of the beam, there is a black bead. When it is necessary to record a column number, simply turn the black bead, and the required recording table will appear within the beam. Calculations can then be performed based on the table. This not only eliminates the risk of incorrect column usage but also assists the user in their calculations. It effectively combines written calculation and mental calculation into one. Regardless of the currency system or complex numbers of any country, they can all be accurately calculated.</p>
<p>(Algorithm) As for the calculation method, it is also simple. The instruction manual divides it into integer algorithm, decimal algorithm, fraction algorithm, omission method, compound number algorithm, compound quantity algorithm, unitary method, proportional calculation method, and various other algorithms. Although the names are numerous and varied, anyone familiar with ordinary abacus calculation can understand them at a glance. The invention and improvement of this calculating tool is truly a major achievement in history and science. The long-standing problems of our industrial and commercial sectors have been solved. According to Mr. Chen, mass production is currently underway, and the government is also making every effort to assist and will include it as a required subject in schools for widespread promotion, with the aim of making it universally accessible.</p>

<h3>"Doing All Kinds of Evil" "Always Responsive"</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>—An Interesting and Detestable Incident—</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that "Seven extortionists, including Ding Yirui, went to the Hong Temple on Nanjing Road to burn incense and pray, then sent letters to the manager of the Yisheng Rubber Factory, demanding money under threat. They were actually extorted for 1,500 yuan. After investigation by detectives, the seven people, including Ding, were arrested. It was said that after obtaining the money, Ding and others made a plaque with the inscription 'Always Responsive' and sent it to the Hong Temple. After investigation, it was confirmed. The court will pronounce the verdict soon."</p>
<p>Everyone finds this incident of the extortionists' whimsical thinking quite "interesting and detestable." Of course, the fact that the extortionists committed a crime is a fact, and the law will judge them accordingly. What we want to talk about is an incidental feeling:</p>
<p>Extortion incidents are common in Shanghai. What is new is "praying for extortion." The extortionists disregard the law, yet have Buddha in their hearts. The plaque they respectfully sent, in my opinion, may be a couplet with the first line missing. Their couplet should be: "Although I do all kinds of evil, you should always be responsive." In fact, in today's Shanghai society, there is a lot of bullish and bearish air every day. Rice merchants say that storage in the warehouses is not abundant, and coal merchants say that the source is not smooth. All in all, they are just threatening the citizens, hoping to make a fortune. After getting the money, the extortionists felt that although they dared to deceive people, they did not dare to deceive the heavens, so they did this kind of "hiding silver three hundred taels here, the neighbor's son has never stolen it" dedication. As for these speculative merchants, they hate having too much hoarding and do not plot without profit. Compared to the extortionists, they do evil hundreds or thousands of times more. However, except for being "always responsive" to their beloved wives and beautiful children when it comes to spending lavishly, they are indifferent to everything else. Of course, if they can get a plaque that says "Money Can Prevent Death" in the Yama's Palace, they will do their best.</p>
<p>Buddha said that all four elements are empty. Now, the extortionists' extortion was surprisingly successful. However, they ended up in jail, and the result is still empty. They prayed for wealth and got a response, but they could not escape punishment. Whether "always responsive" is beneficial or harmful to them, they only know today that it is too late to regret. Then there are those speculators who have already been scorned by society and some who are throwing themselves into the legal net. Today's doing all kinds of evil and being always responsive is also tomorrow's suffering from wealth and the defeat of children. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. Money can save people, but it can also kill people. I hope that all visible and invisible extortionists will immediately wake up and not take the path of suicide!</p>
<p>The plaque offered by the extortionists actually claimed to be disciples, which is really a disgrace to Buddhism. The fact that these law-breaking "disciples" are ultimately brought to justice is precisely the "manifestation of the Buddha's mighty spirit"! I am not a Buddhist, but I do have a precept of "sincerity brings efficacy." I think that all those who seek fame, profit, and all kinds of satisfaction of desires are in vain. Only sincerity, frankness, purity, enthusiasm, and loyalty in dealing with people, sincere self-discipline, and seeking peace of mind can truly be always responsive and always efficacious. These extortionists offering a plaque to the Hong Temple is of course laughable, but ultimately pathetic.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Moscow's Air Defense</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>Since suffering its first air raid on July 21st, Moscow is now being bombed by German aircraft almost every day. Based on the extensive experience gained, Moscow's air defense lines are also gradually being improved and enriched.</p>
<p>Currently, Moscow's air defense is formed by five elements: (1) anti-aircraft guns, (2) aircraft, (3) barrage balloon teams, (4) fire brigades, and (5) self-defense forces. In terms of nature, the first three belong to the offensive, while the latter two belong to passive defense.</p>
<p>The self-defense forces are organized by citizens. Their tasks are: conveying orders, assisting fire brigades, and rescuing the injured, etc. All men between the ages of sixteen and sixty are obligated to participate in the team, and in emergencies, women between the ages of eighteen and fifty are also mobilized.</p>
<p>Aircraft and anti-aircraft guns are deployed at key points on the outskirts of Moscow, trying to block the intrusion of German aircraft into Moscow city. Closely cooperating with them are the aircraft observers scattered every ten kilometers outside Moscow. However, according to past experience, some enemy aircraft inevitably break through the air defense network and appear in the city's airspace, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs. At this time, the most important thing is to reduce the damage to a minimum. Therefore, air-raid shelters and defense against incendiary bombs are indispensable equipment. In this regard, the world's largest and best-equipped subway, built in Moscow before the war by the Soviet authorities, can be said to be extremely prescient. The subway is currently being used as the largest air-raid shelter, but it obviously cannot accommodate all the people of Moscow. Therefore, the basements of major buildings are being quickly converted into air-raid shelters. These basements were used as cafeterias and warehouses before the war and have equipment such as chairs, so using them as air-raid shelters is very ideal.</p>
<p>The subway turns into an air-raid shelter every night from eight to nine o'clock. When there is no air-raid alarm, women and children are allowed to enter from nine o'clock in the afternoon. After the last tram passes, wooden boards are laid on the tracks, and beds are built on top of them. When an air-raid alert is received, ordinary men and women can run in and squeeze onto the platforms or the tracks covered with boards. To meet the needs of the general public, food and drinks are sold here, and some stations even have newsreels playing, so hiding inside does not feel boring.</p>
<p>Each floor of Moscow's apartments has sand and water prepared. Bathtubs must be filled with water all day long, and shovels, hoes, sickles, fire extinguishers, lanterns, and anti-incendiary masks must all be prepared in advance. At the beginning of the war, the authorities ordered all households to close their windows during air raids, but according to practical experience, when encountering bombs with great explosive force, closed windows are more likely to have their glass shattered than open windows. Therefore, the authorities revised their previous order. Upon receiving an alert, all windows except those in the basement must be opened. The windows of the basement are covered with sandbags and wooden boards to prevent the glass from shattering.</p>
<p>Moscow is making the greatest effort in the defense against incendiary bombs. The most hardworking in this regard are the self-defense forces mentioned above. After the air-raid alert is issued, the more active young people in the self-defense forces climb to the rooftops to monitor the dropping of incendiary bombs. However, after two or three air raids, it was proved that monitoring on the roof is very dangerous because anti-aircraft gun shrapnel falls on the body like rain. Therefore, according to the new rules, monitors should monitor from the top floor. When he sees an incendiary bomb falling on the roof, he immediately jumps out of the window on the top floor and pushes it onto the street or garden with a wooden stick. Below, another group of self-defense forces is waiting. When they see an incendiary bomb falling, they quickly use sand and water to extinguish it. The agility of the self-defense forces in doing this heroic work is admirable.</p>
<h3>"The Pig's Answer"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>In "The Purpose of Life" written by Bolespon, we saw "The Pig's Answer." He wrote the purpose of the pig's life in a satirical tone.</p>
<p>He said, "The life of a pig is nothing more than drinking swill and being lazy all day long to maintain their obesity and create delicious ham! But even if they don't do this, the supply of ham is still their destiny."</p>
<p>But the destiny of human beings is not to supply ham. Why are so many people as stupid as pigs? Why are they heading towards the same destiny as pigs?</p>
<p>No matter how many millions of gold dollars you have, no matter how much false fame and power you have, but if you die, you will be as unknown as a pig. What do you share with mankind! That is so pitiful!</p>
<p>Are we just living in this society and only getting food and sleep?</p>

<h3>The "Electric Rabbit" in the Target Range</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>A novel method used by the British Royal Air Force to train machine gunners is to put a model aircraft, nicknamed "Electric Rabbit," on a car, and then have the car carrying the aircraft run quickly around the range on a circular narrow track as a target, and then have the gunners aim at the moving target and practice shooting. To make it more realistic, they painted the model aircraft with the German swastika emblem, which is also easier to arouse interest. The principle of this "Electric Rabbit" is the same as the electric rabbit in a dog racing track.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Life of Fourteen Heroes "Madam, I've heard you mention the Guiding Society several times, mostly because my dad is too stubborn and didn't let you recommend me to go there. But when I think about it carefully, since you say it's just accompanying people from other places to buy things and strolling around the park, it doesn't really matter. It's a pity that I'm also a country bumpkin who just arrived in Shanghai, otherwise I really want to ask you to recommend me to try it out."</p>
<p>The woman, who was every bit a Shanghai playboy's sister-in-law, was so happy that she almost laughed her nose off. She said that as long as you know a lot of words, the roads in Shanghai are the easiest to find. She didn't have time to say anything else to Mei Bao, so she quickly urged her to wash up and go to a so-called Harmonious Guiding Society.</p>
<p>Luckily, Mei Bao was very resourceful. As soon as she saw the small pavilion filled with many heavily made-up women and a few gigolos, she suddenly understood. Before the proprietress could achieve her purpose of selling her, she hurriedly ran back.</p>
<p>Because of this incident, she became more aware of the difficulty of making a living and also knew that women's opportunities were indeed more difficult than men's. Therefore, when Qiu Haitang came home and said something, although she felt very suspicious in her heart, she did not have the courage to ask further.</p>
<p>Seeing that his daughter already believed him, Qiu Haitang became even more relieved and tried his best to put on a happy face. (257)</p>

<h3>Stomach Disease Classic</h3>
<p>Knowing the Judgment of Good and Bad Stomach Medicine: Any stomach medicine that, after taking for half a month, does not improve but requires an increasing dosage, can be determined to be absolutely impossible to cure stomach disease and may even worsen it. Conversely, any stomach medicine that, after taking for half a month, shows complete recovery or relief and can reduce the dosage, can be trusted to cure stomach disease. There are many stomach medicines on the market, but the only one whose dosage can be gradually reduced until the disease is completely eradicated and health is restored is "Qubing."</p>
<p>Treating Stomach Disease Requires Treating Stomach Ulcers</p>
<p>The root of old stomach diseases lies in stomach ulcers. Stomach medicines containing anesthetics and alkaline substances such as sodium bicarbonate or calcium, magnesium, and bismuth cannot cure stomach ulcers, so they can never cure old stomach diseases. "Qubing" is a newly created aluminum compound that can quickly heal stomach ulcers, so it can cure old stomach diseases. Stopping stomach pain is just one of its effects.</p>
<p>"Qubing" Overpowers Famous Imported Medicines</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly heard that people with old stomach diseases have been taking foreign stomach medicines for many years, but their condition has not improved, or even worsened. However, after taking "Qubing" for a month, the disease was completely eradicated and health was restored. Furthermore, according to reports from many doctors, the curative effect of "Qubing" in eradicating stomach diseases has indeed surpassed all famous and expensive stomach medicines from the East and West. Other low-grade medicines are not worth mentioning. This is truly good news for stomach disease patients and a glory for the domestic industry. Produced by Tianping Pharmaceutical Factory. Various packages and pocket boxes are sold in major pharmacies and companies. Trial packs are sold in tobacco paper stores.</p>

<h3>Man-Er Oberon Talks About Why Wives Leave Their Husbands</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Hollywood star Man-Er Oberon, a lively star, recently refuted a university professor's statement with her eloquent tongue, adding glory to the female world. The matter is like this: John Hanfan, a professor of law at Philadelphia, listed six reasons why a husband does not like to be with his wife, one of which said: "They are unkempt and disheveled at breakfast."</p>
<p>"Professor John's words have their merits," Miss Man unconvincingly criticized, "but he has overlooked that this issue has two sides, so it must be observed from the wife's perspective!"</p>
<p>Miss Man then listed six reasons why wives are often unwilling to be with their husbands and would rather go out for a walk alone, because husbands commit the following mistakes:</p>
<p>(1) Hiding in their own offices all day long.</p>
<p>(2) Thinking that reading books and newspapers is more interesting than family conversations.</p>
<p>(3) Talking about shops and closing their mouths about factories, as if they are living for their careers.</p>
<p>(4) When she goes to talk to him, he yells at you like a pig.</p>
<p>(5) Paying attention to art, culture, etc., and not caring about other things.</p>
<p>(6) Considering "love" as old news.</p>
<p>Miss Man concluded: "If husbands can correct these shortcomings, then many wives may no longer be unkempt and disheveled at breakfast!"</p>
<p>Listen! How true and humorous are Miss Man's words!</p>
<h3>Zhang Wenjuan Records "The Strange Injustice Case"</h3>
<p>— Lili</p>
<p>All Twelve Sides - Shipping in Three Weeks</p>
<p>Kun actor (female playing male roles) Zhang Wenjuan performed "Golden Stage" last month, receiving good reviews and ticket sales. After her performance at "Golden Stage" ended, she originally planned to return north. However, the Asia-Pacific Victory Company asked the painter Ding Song to negotiate with her about recording records, so she temporarily delayed her departure. The recording negotiations went smoothly, and she is recording the "Complete Strange Injustice Case," a total of twelve sides, from "Setting Out" to "Begging for the Basin," with Liu Binkun, the number one comedian from the South, and others playing the roles of Zhang Biegui, etc. The musician is the famous left-handed king, Zhao Lama. "The Strange Injustice Case" is a famous Tan school opera and one of Wenjuan's masterpieces. After going north, many small arias were corrected by Meng Xiaodong, which made it even more perfect. The entire lyrics and phonetics were studied more than seven times beforehand before being completely recorded at Victory yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>According to Victory's Mr. Pu Meizhong, songs and records can be sold in Southeast Asia and are relatively popular in the country. Therefore, record companies are now collecting more of these records. As for Peking opera, sales are limited to a portion of Peking opera enthusiasts, so they are collecting fewer. This time, we invited Ms. Zhang to record the "Complete Strange Injustice Case" after careful consideration and with considerable confidence. Therefore, the records can be shipped by the end of this month at the latest.</p>
<h3>Salon Concert</h3>
<p>— Hong Jin</p>
<p>To be Performed at the YMCA</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai music scene has been quite vibrant. Concerts of harmonicas and accordions, etc., are being held continuously. Not long ago, Lang Yuxiu's two solo concerts at the Lyceum Theatre were sold out, showing the enthusiasm of the general public. Music is truly spiritual food.</p>
<p>At 8:30 pm on the 12th of this month, the Salon Concert will be performed publicly at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The main program includes eight items: (1) Wu Zheng (tenor solo), (2) H. Meye (violin solo), (3) Porge (cello solo), (4) Trio, (5) Trio Munuet form, (6) Soprano solo "Flower Selling Song" by Zhang Hao, (7) Chorus. Among them, several points should be introduced to the readers: Tenor Wu Zheng, Ms. Lang Yuxiu, and Mr. Si Yigui are all students of the Russian vocal expert Shu Shuline, and are among his most outstanding students. Several months ago, he held a personal solo concert at the Russian Art Theatre, and the grand occasion can be proven by the facts. Now he will hold a personal concert at the Lyceum Theatre. Mr. Meye is a famous violinist from Moscow, and his superb technique makes him a first-class contemporary violinist. In addition, composer Zheng Shouyan put in a lot of effort for the success of this concert. I would like to emphasize this specifically, hoping that music lovers will pay attention.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk - The Nomad Cavalry Filled the City with Dust</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu and three other heroes were about to leave Shanhaiguan and go to another place, striving to eliminate traitors for the country. Unexpectedly, someone came chasing after them on the road. Zhang Cangqiu looked back and saw three horses galloping toward them on the main road behind them. The first horse was ridden by a general, with a fair complexion and a short beard under his chin, who was none other than Chai Ying. He couldn't help but be stunned, and immediately turned his horse around and waited. Chai Ying's horse ran to him and pulled the reins to stop. He bowed on horseback and said, "Brother Zhang, where are you going?" Zhang Cangqiu heard him ask so closely and didn't know what to say for a moment. Seeing that the two horses behind Chai Ying were ridden by Chai Ying's trusted followers, he forced a smile and said, "Brother Chai, aren't you staying in Ningyuan?" "How did you get back here?" Chai Ying heard Zhang Cangqiu not answer his question but instead ask him, smiled, and jumped off his horse. Zhang Cangqiu saw Chai Ying dismount and also jumped off his horse. Chen Fei, Xu Jing, Liu Yinying, and others also dismounted together. Chai Ying wiped the sweat from his forehead, took Zhang Cangqiu's hand, and said, "Let's go to the woods ahead to talk." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Alright." The four followed Chai Ying to a pine forest to the east, where the lush grass was like green brocade and the wild flowers seemed to burn. Everyone sat on the ground. Their horses were being watched over by Chai Ying's two followers over there. Chai Ying said first, "I heard in Ningyuan that the rebel Li was about to move to the capital, which also shocked me. Then I received General Wu's order to launch an expedition against the rebels, which gave me some comfort. But then I heard that General Wu had retreated to Shanhaiguan, and Li's rebels were launching a large-scale attack, and there was news of a raid on Ningyuan. (123)</p>
