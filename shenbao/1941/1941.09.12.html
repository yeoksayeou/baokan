<p>中日作戰，已歷四載，在中國實為空前之長期的全面對外戰爭，而在日本，其於中日日俄兩役中所從未前經之戰時痛苦，今乃於對華戰事中一一親歷。人力物力之匱乏，國際反饗之重大，皆已超過日本所能禁受程度之外，蔣委員長隔昨謂日軍之作戰力量已大見削弱，且已成强弩之末，此固舉世共見之事實，即日人自身，亦復難於掩飾或否認。然而其力雖絀，其欲未戢，第一次大戰中所促成日本之强盛繁榮，日人今尙憧憬不置，基此一念，乃有三國，盟約之締結，南進北進之醞釀。然而揆之事賈，即在前次大戰中，日方之屢置盟約義務（英日同盟）於不顧，唯自身利益之是騖，已使協約各國成為側目，雖在作戰期間，未免存投鼠忌器之念，而和會而後，旋即以華盛頓會議約束其無限止擴展之企圖。近一年來，日本對於三國同盟之基本信念如何姑置不諭，以近頃所表現者言之、則顯已失望於軸心之前途，轉而以此為對民抬國家要挾勒索之張本。在美國方面，因切望太平徉之相安，自信日本可以威逼勢迫而就範，於是乃有美日談話之遂行。然倘使軸心成望猶昔，日本實力未損，其必不肯在美國巨棒頻揮之下對美進行移樽就教之會談，本報昨日已論之矣。自日本一貫之作風觀之，上次大戰中之往事已如上述，至於最近情形，三國同盟為其多年國策重心所寄，今已漸啟離心之象，日本對於蘇聯為具有中立義務之友邦，其於美油運蘇亦復不勝其悻悻，則即使美日談話有成，此一新的夥伴是否可加信賴，大平洋方面是否即可高枕無憂，固在任何人均不敢輕加保證。即在美當局，其對於日本之然諾亦未必作過重之估量，一方對日進行談判，一方則對華加緊支援，「中國為美國之偉大國防」一語，其意義與價值固不因美日進行談話而有所改變也。</p>
<p>日本之亟謀對美進行談判，由於不堪民治國家之經濟重壓，更由於對華戰爭之無法結束，而後者尤為其中心困難所在，蓋苟非其大部實力已消耗於四年來之長期苦戰中，急進份子不惜一戰之大言或已被採納為今日日本對外之國策，英美雖欲太平洋相安無事，不可得也。在已往四年中，中國儼然為民治陣營在遠東之唯－砥柱，即在並世列强均不免對彼假以辭色之際，中國亦復始終屹立不拔，迄未少移其堅定立塲。以此之故、及民治國家轉危為安獲有餘力應付遠東之際，經濟制裁手段乃能使日本為之氣餒。雖其根木擴展意念一如往昔，在目前則不能不稍形斂跡，轉而期以談判略蘇困窘。然而中國奮戰與經濟制裁二者，互為表裏，相得益彰，斷不容於日本並未改變其根本立塲之前，輕為取捨；蔣委員長指出：「中國一方面賡續作戰，一方面對日本之經濟制裁必將加緊，最少亦不致鬆弛」，「此乃大平洋上有關各國互相諒解之約束」，同時此亦遠東戢止擴展撥亂反正之不二要圖</p>
<p>華軍之總反攻，年來為中外人士所共同屬望，曩者屢有將於今秋實現之傳說，乃遲遲至今，尙無所發動，或不免使若干人士為之觖望。然而須知以裝備戰具向居劣勢之華軍，求其於反攻發揮滿意之戰果，其不能純恃決心勇氣與人力固不待言，其間更必須有充分之準備渦程。美國租借法案於今春始通過實施，距今不過數月，且過去仍以援英為重心，其大批供應品之運抵中國與夫軍事顧問之派遣乃最近間事。以英國產業之發達，國力之雄厚，且有美方戰具之大批接濟，迄今且未能乘東綫大戰機會作大規模之反攻，則中國總反攻之遲未寶那固無足異。然而中國最高軍事統帥旣於隔昨對美記者表示將奮戰到底且將作必要之犧牲矣，此始無異於華軍發動反攻之問接宣示。旬日以前，東戰塲各區華軍迭有局部反攻，發揮相當戰果而外，且克復若干要邑；近頃金融財政方面亦咸有嶄新之賢明設施，且後方各省普遍豐收，食糧威脅已大為減輕，凡此種種，咸足增强必勝之信心。則無論美日間談話之結局為暫獲苟安，為轉形惡化，悉不足以決定遠東之基本動向，此後一切，主要仍視乎中國之繼續奮戰。</p>

<p>德國在叙利亞與維希法人勾結之陰謀、同時正積極進行、而叙利亞總督鄧資以卑鄙奸佞之方式、竭力促進德方之利益、當時吾人受壓迫、我軍旣退出希臘、而喪失大批配綫、復爲非洲德軍所侵入、而吾人又須應付伊拉克之叛變、然吾人終能會同自由法軍攻入叙利亞、自由法軍作戰甚勇、而英軍數約四師、其中澳兵與印英軍數約四師、其中澳兵與印兵迭著戰績、英軍之佔領叙利亞、使塞普羅斯島得獲安全、近東部份得臻穩定、我海軍與空軍對於地中海東端之控制得着效率而吾人亦得與土耳其友人作直接之接觸、而握油管綫及其他資源之控制權、吾人在叙利亞約無野心、旣不欲代有法國在叙利亞任何部份之地位、亦不欲奪取法人之利益、吾人不過因欲獲戰事之勝利而入叙利亞耳、惟余必須聲明者、自由法人已予贊同之吾人政策、厥爲以叙利亞交與叙利亞人、彼等將在最早可能時期復獲其獨立主權、</p>
<p>軸心難越雷池侵埃迷夢粉碎</p>
<p>同時我尼羅江軍隊之東翼、對於復行奪回西列內加之德義軍、曾予以兩度之重大打擊、敵軍已自覺不能向埃及進攻、因未能攻陷英澳軍所堅守之社白魯克要隘也、我軍於五六月間曾在西沙漢向敵猛攻、雖未能逐退敵軍、但已使敵軍停頓不前、德人所發五月底可抵蘇彝士河之狂言、已證明其毫無價值、我方生力軍已陸續開抵尼羅江前綫、余信我方定能防守埃及、而不使敵軍越過西沙漠、本年四月初我方在擊潰義軍後而遭之不幸頓挫、今確已銷滅、吾人誠可對此美滿之發展爲之滿足、</p>
<p>稱譽紅軍抗戰必予有效援助</p>
<p>茲轉述範圍更大之戰事、蘇軍之堅强抗戰、與其從廣大陳綫撤退之可驚的方式、確打破希特勒所抱對蘇速戰速了之希望、德蘇開戰三月於茲、希特勒所流日耳曼人之血、較諸上次大戰任何一年中所濺於戰塲者爲多、今後尙須在極長而極險之交通綫上、於北方嚴寒肆虐及蘇軍猛烈反攻之時、維持駐守自北冰洋起至黑海止全部陳綫之軍隊、自德國侵蘇之日起、吾人即已傾其全力以極迅速而有效之援助、給予吾人新同志國、余不欲討論吾人已經研究之軍事計劃致生妨礙、更不能對此問題有所辯論、余所可暢言者唯在接濟方面、余對於致斯達林之文與羅斯福總統意見相同、此種需要至爲迫切、而範圍亦至廣大、今蘇聯一大部份軍火與鋼鐵出產、已落於德人之手、而蘇聯且須配備一千萬至一千五百萬兵士之武裝、</p>
<p>蘇京三國會議開幕期不在遠</p>
<p>故蘇英美會議將以如何能使蘇聯繼續抗戰、及如何調整接濟爲工作、在佈置此種會議或選擇出席人物之時、難免稍有延緩、或有以不作一事爲言者、其實整個問題之研討、在英美雙方未嘗稍有停頓、吾人現待美國代表團之來臨、余料美使命團即日可到、英方代表以皮佛勃洛克爲領袖、其人會與羅斯福總統作極密切之晤談、與皮氏同行之人物業已選定、其名單至相當時可予公佈、至於出發日期未便披露、但爲期必不在遠、目前許多甚重要緊急決定正在進行中、而大批接濟品亦已在途、吾人在軍火方面、必須準備作重大犧牲以應蘇聯之需要、（衆歡呼凡與出產有關者、須作極大之努力、不僅爲援蘇、且亦塡補吾人所亟需的供應中之罅隙、凡給予蘇聯者皆取諸吾人所自製者、或取諸美國原擬運交英國者、英國與英帝國之出產、今在增高繼長之中、在作戰之第三年中、軍火出產當可達於完全高度、如美國履行其自定工作、則甚大工廠尙須設立或改造、而美國民間之銷費亦須縮减、吾人前所恃美國軍用品之接濟暫行或將减少、但在某項限度內、吾人周準備接受此事實也、</p>
<p>打通伊朗路綫便利運蘇戰具</p>
<p>吾人眀遭其他限制因素、如時間距離與興地是、運輸與海港之便利有其限度、尤以航運爲甚、通入蘇聯之路僅有三條開放、一爲經過阿昌格爾之北冰洋路、此綫或將爲冬季冰塊所阻滯、二爲經過海參崴之遠東路綫、此爲日方所嫉視者、其鐵路樓延長七千餘哩、三爲穿越波斯之路綫、此綫由波斯灣展至裏海、延長五百哩、裏海有蘇聯强盛海軍、且可直達蘇聯中心之伏爾加流域、上述三綫以波斯綫爲最短、德人當然以其故技活動於波斯、於是德方旅行團使命團與外交家熒惑波斯朝野、以期造成第五縱隊、俾支配德黑蘭政府而封閉吾人可通蘇聯之最穩而最短路綫、又不僅奪取或搗毀油田已也、吾人故認爲有制止此種活動不許其成功之必要、乃向波斯政府要求立即對條頓人下逐客令、吾人必須使當地德義人悉交吾人掌握中、（衆歡呼）且必使德義使館退出波斯、至其外交官地位、吾入當然予以尊重、吾人必須對於由溫水海港巴斯拉至裏海之交通、有無可非議的管理與維持之權、（衆歡呼）庶英美接濟可由此源源不斷的運入蘇聯中部、吾人將作種種努力、以改善鐵路交通、而擴張目前英軌鐵路上所可運輸之接濟品數量、幸此項鐵路近甫完工、祗需犬批車輛與機車以擴充此接濟綫耳、余想下院定贊成吾人不得不採以達此面要目的之嚴峻計劃、（衆歡呼）波斯之佔領可使吾人與蘇軍南翼携手、而作陸軍與空軍之行動、且可使吾人達其阻止德方東進之目的、至是武功卓著之印軍、得担任更大之工作、而使戰禍遠離印人家庭在千哩之外、故吾人必須期料我英印軍隊以及澳洲或其他自治領軍隊、將逐漸大展其威力於此廣大荒凉而未發展之區域中、今協約軍之陳綫成一半圓形、起自北冰洋之斯畢茨柏根島而至西沙漠之杜白魯克、</p>
<p>英國地位改觀確保海上安全</p>
<p>余可欣然言者、大西洋與印度洋現有之充量海軍實力、可使海道不遭攻擊、倘吾人回溯前事、定覺吾人在近東或東方之地位現已確實改善、與法國倏然退出戰局及義國向吾人猛攻時不可同日而語、蓋在當時吾人分駐近東各地之軍隊、人數旣寡而配備亦奇缺、其所有之最佳者、蓋皆已送往法國陣綫矣、吾人且喪失通過地中海安全交通之工具、與吾人所依賴之主要根據地、而非洲各處與尼羅江流域及巴力斯坦如開羅·耶路撒冷·等名城之防務、亦復使吾人時切隱憂、當時固無一處安全也、但時逾一載、事態改觀、吾人已編成大軍數達七十五萬、而獲有各種配備、吾人空軍已大加發展、而在迅速擴張中、吾人已征服義國在非之整個帝國、而殺傷與俘獲義軍逾四十萬人、吾人已鞏固埃及之邊防、以防德義軍之攻擊、吾人已充實在巴力斯坦與伊拉克之地位、吾人已握有叙利亞之控制權、而予塞　　　島以安全、吾人更以迅速有力之行動、已在波斯與蘇軍提携、而處於阻比敵人東進之路綫、無論今後如何、此種成績定可得歷史之欽崇、英國之需要不容作任何形式之事前誇張、今非自詡之時、但一年前吾人地顯甚黑暗、此爲事實、今日則吾人不妨告人曰、吾人現仍爲吾人命運之主人翁、仍爲吾人　魂之執掌者矣、</p>
<p>議員一致表示擁護羅邱宣言</p>
<p>英相演說時、旁聽席中有中國·蘇聯·西班牙之大使、及南非·澳洲·與加拿大之駐英辦事大員、英相檢討戰局敷陳事實、未嘗注意於修詞、工黨反對派李斯史密士起稱、渠覺英國現狀較諸一年前確有可滿意之理由、戰局中有大轉點四、一爲法國之陷落、二爲英國之空戰、三爲美國租借案、四爲蘇聯不獨使德國司令部且使世界各參謀部咸爲驚異之神奇的抗戰、渠甚望英美八點宣言儘速實施、如須遺陸軍前往歐陸、渠望有完善準備可以進攻而非永取守勢、埃及爲宜於冬戰之一國、希特勒運輸供應品越過地中海之大努力、表示希特勒亦知埃及宜於冬戰云、自由黨領袖哈利斯贊成盡力援蘇之必要、並謂八點宣言乃現代兩大偉人所簽定之大西洋憲章、爲吾人憑以建築之基礎、渠甚願英美國會皆批准此憲章、而後由協約國政府通過之云、掌璽大臣阿特里言反對此大西洋憲章之訾議、謂英美兩大國領袖所發之言論、祇可涉及一船原則、目前不能言及施於將來世界之詳細程序、英政府與其人民決定竭其所能以援助協約國　、共產黨議員加拉轍插問日、政府人人皆如此乎、阿特里答曰然、人人如是、凡可爲者皆可爲之、吾人將以吾人所可給予者給予蘇聯、但須知此須取諸出產、而吾人出產尙未足敷吾人需求、吾人準備犧牲準備增多出產云、（全文完）</p>

<h3>紗花　投機紗商養精蓄銳　且聽羅斯福詞再決雌雄</h3>
<p>紗市復入眠狀態中、此因人心大都看跌、所以拋空之額頗增、放空者之觀念、謂國際局勢恐生變化、莫不養精蓄銳、待　總統今日之演詞宣佈後、再決雌雄、於是市態十分平淡乏勁、至於大戶吸收之額、亦不放棄、可想雙方爭持之劇烈、不知鹿死誰手耶、不過現紗港幫採辦甚少、又有人說、南洋方面皆係洋行直接談判之交易頗旺、但船隻較缺、不及裝運、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百四十七元、低價爲一千七百三十八元、午後開盤爲一千七百四十三元、昂至－千七百四十六元、收盤價爲千七百四十元、目前紗市就本身上着想、不能鬆懈也、然謠諑紛繁、尤使人心不一、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、隨隔昨人氣良好、首驚價爲一千七百四十五元、少頃升至一千七百四十七元、嗣後聞現紗交易不多、空頭又活黝、至於取引所開盤較軟而疲、市情又復下降至一千七百三十八元、然南洋方面洋行購辦、每日有成交、且售價殊昂、人心重振、大戶逢低收進、又升至一千七百四十七元、迨至收盤、回鬆一步、價爲一千七百四十三元、查半日間成交統計九千一百包、皆係同行成交云、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、於沉悶之氣氛中、趨勢迂迴、目轉淸閑、蓋以美棉告疲、而國際間之消息尙在期待展開、乃取引所又乍上乍落、使人心忐忑、無從相依、故大戶方面、其多頭者在此中檔行市中、一時殊少進意、而空頭亦以顧忌環象之變遷、更鮮活動、以致市態寥寂、引成醞釀之勢、故上落狹小、近遠期高低僅參差於七八元之間、當上午開出九月期初做爲一六四九元、十月期爲一六六〇元、十一月期爲一六七七元、中途因廠單趨疲、浮多頗有脫手、故近期一度低至一六四六元、十月期降達一六五七元、十一月跌至一六七三元、迨至午收稍見回挺、午後盤旋、依然初定後疲、買戶潛力未能加强、致爲散空所乘、故近收盤時、十一月期曾又低至一六七三元、乃呈無力、結果九月期爲－六四九元五角、因隔昨未升、故好五元五角、十月期爲一六五八元五角、下跌一元五角、十一月期爲六七四元五角、亦跌六元五角、茲將開收盤及高低價列左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>秋雨秋風　愁煞棉</h3>
<p>現棉情况、粗絨旣俏、售價日昂、此因存底趨薄、二則來源困難、之國內氣候陰濕、秋風秋雨、鬧個不休、新棉產大遭摧殘、將後之棉市、未可限量、同時南洋方面布疋需要興繁、皆需二十三支紗紡製也、</p>
<p>紐市棉市、因有華盛頓　消息、財政部長摩根韜要求放出政府棉麥之影響、大衆了結、及南方幫套賣頗爲活躍、市况因之乃遭慘跌、中問一度雖因空頭抵補而略漲、但過後又因紐奧倫斯疲弱再跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日約跌四十三四磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市休業、預測今日開盤市况、較之昨日約跌五羅比左右、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况又轉平淡、大槪因美棉見跌、及大衆採取觀望大度的影響、連日成交不多、昨日僅巴西棉稍有購意外、其餘略見呆滯、</p>
<h3>計算紗成本三要素　機器原料工作三者缺一不可二十支紗約爲一千六百餘元</h3>
<p>舊同事、某紗號經理某君、見本報商業新聞欄的紗花報道中、有關於紡製二十支紗之原料價云、每担須售三百五十元至三百八十元、一包棉紗需花三担半、再加開繳雜費二百五十元至三百元、如斯廠方成本、在　千八九百元（？）之間…」云、認爲錯誤、倩筆者、重寫一稿、作較爲翔實的報道、以免淆惑觀聽、</p>
<p>談到目前二十支棉紗的成本問題、價格的因素、是有多方面的聯繫性的、第一、是機器的（生產工其）、優·劣·攸關生產量的速率、（多或寡）、間接就影嚮於成本、譬如說同樣一家紗廠、同樣擁有紡錠一萬枚、一係新式機、（年齡近的）、一係舊式機、（年齡遠的）、則最後的各個生產率、便相差得很遠了、新式機的出紗、一日夜每一紡錠能產二十支紗一磅二十五至一磅半、若舊式機、則每一紡錠、出不到紗一磅、大約在〇九五左右、如是同樣一萬枚紗錠、新機一日夜、可出一萬二千斤百榜至一萬五千磅、而舊機則僅出九千五百磅左右、相差達三五千磅之鉅、（紗的產量亦即相差達十件內外）、就可影嚮到成本的高低、第二、是用棉的優劣、用纖維較佳的棉、看是成本增高實則較用纖維差的棉花反合廉、因爲用花量輕、下脚少、反之、則用花重、下脚多、反而會增高成本的、第三、是工作的人事管理、車間工務職員們、處處能雊知道愛惜物力、節省物料、那麼每件紗的成本、必然會减輕了許多、反之、工務員們、隨隨便便、不知注意愛惜物力、監督工人、任聽工人浪費物料、則成本必然加重、所以機器、原料工作、是攸關棉紗成本的最大因素、有的用花、需三百五十五斤、（或竟達三百六十斤）有的祇需三百四十六七斤、大致在三百五十斤左右、內印棉（如阿姆拉、彭加坡等）佔十成之八、本棉（如火機等）、佔十成之二、印棉每担價四百元左右、火機棉每扣價三百元左右、統扯每担花本三百八十元、用花三百五十斤算、共需花本一千三百三十元、再加開繳費、（包括製造費、管理費、財矜費等）三百元（列如工資、一百二十元、電力七十元、物料六十元、利息、雜費、保險等約五十元）、如是一件二十支棉紗的總成本、共計一千六百三十元、（即使相差些、亦不到一千七百元也）、市價在－千七百五十元左右、廠方還有百餘元一件的凈益、多空商人、自可以作參酌、（龍駒）</p>
<p>糧食　八月份調查　來滬洋米四十萬包　昨日米價先疲而後堅</p>
<p>洋米進口、本報逐日報告、每月總結　布一次、計上月（八月份）共到洋米四十萬零四千一百五十六包、內由香港運來者二十萬零七千一百十七包、暹邏直接裝來六萬五千五百二十九句、西貢直接裝來六萬七千五百包、仰光直接運來三萬包、荷屬東印度爪哇亦有三萬四千包、本市工部局之平價洋米、亦在上述總數之內、</p>
<p>昨洋米市况呈盤旋局勢、早晨開市承前日疲風、目市塲中和平空氣十分濃厚、不獨新多頭不敢冒險問津、即孰有手貨者亦力求脫手、市乃一蹶不振、繼續下降、小絞自一百零六元小至一百零四元、而外棧竟小至一百零三元、比之前日下午低價又小一二元、但價小後貨方巳不忍再爲賤脫、且以目下工部局以賣價尙須一百十七元、比之市價相差十三四元之多、况目前新定雖通、價則略高、隨爲一般投機幫積極趁小拉進、市乃疲而復振、小絞現貨又大至一百零六七元、英華司路貨一度小至一百三十二元、大市現貨原包一百廿七元及一百廿九元、均比前開小一元半至三四元不等、然後市貨方堅守、行情又復喊高、全日交易終以本客囤戶懾於和平之謠未敢多進、成交現貨不足萬包、英華司祇三四百噸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米市仍以銷塲不爽、致貨主難能扳持、繼隨洋米步低元砠、開南港早粳白四十九元、百四十七元、無錫特粳百五十一元、至於浦東新粳則以天時陰雨、到貨寥落、貨主售心較堅、計開百五十一元至百五十元零九角、</p>
<p>糯米因他貨連日貶跌、人心頓被影響、昨日需躉兩胃均見轉懈、致雖市貨稀少、市價亦難維持、見降一二元、開查費特別白元百廿六七元、大市高自百廿五元牛、次至百廿一元、糯菉百十一二元、</p>
<h3>粉麥亦少精神</h3>
<p>洋粉在和平謠諑濃厚中、形勢已經疲軟無神、且昨報載麵粉已經列人進口貨之給外滙條例中、足以打破日來宣傳麵粉不結外滙之謠、新囤因袖手不辦、有手貨者多虛怯求脫、因此市乃更見疲軟、砲合開價祇三十二元一角、金龍亦自三十元零七角小至三十元零五角、行情均見較落二三角、惟新定久未成議、在上月中亦祇定十多萬包、洋麥自月初有行商坎麥三千噸解配廠後迄、今到定兩乏、華廠又無杜麥接濟、勢必難乎爲繼、故本粉始終站在三十四元間、大戶行囤亦不肯再脫、粉價隨見父在本客新囤趁小吸收中逐步回振、砲台仍至三十二元四角、而金龍西棧三十元零八角反見微挺、成交近二萬包、</p>
<h3>油市　肥皂廠辦生油　油價抵空回好</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、始跌繼昂、初承上日謠風、人心猶鮮振作、價曾一度又見挫落一二元、嗣因空戶趁低進補、及紗花幫大戶突有躉額吸收、致市勢爲之由疲轉堅、行情一致步升、結果菜油及棉子油比上日反漲三四元、統計售開九月下交大有廠淸油八千餘担、開盤價爲一百六十四元半、最低至一百六十一元、收盤及最高爲一百六十八元、又日華廠菜油五千多桶、開盤一百六十一元牛、最低一百六十元、最高一百六十九元、收盤一百六十七元、尙有本街及肥皂廠辦去靑島生油二百四十桶、價爲一百七十元烟台生油五百聽、價二百五十六元、</p>
<p>又十一日來滬有豆子四百七十包、由天津運來、生油三百件、由靑島運來、</p>
<p>糖市　一旬中到九萬餘包　糖價步降</p>
<p>日來上　糖市、橫　堅抬、但一觀本報所查之洋糖到滬、反較前爲旺、昨又由太古公司江蘇輪由香港裝來大批砂糖、計一萬一千七百零九包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、按本月公所到洋糖已有九萬三千九百七十五包、並不爲少、而糖商操縱不已、（祖）</p>
<p>昨糖市先鬆後回緊、公司期貨粗白二十日期一百三十七元零五角、逐小至二十九元三角、後復至三十一元二角、下午三十一元五角·三十二元九角·八角、小六角、三十日期一百三十一元六角至三十元零六角、回起至三十三元三角、下午三十一元七角、三十四元二角·六角、小八角、現貨劃盤八月份入口一百三十二元至四角、下午三十三元六角、七月份三十一元七角、至三十二元、下午三十三元、六月份一百三十一元三角、下午三十三元、五月份三十元零五角、下午三十二元、太古車白B嘜一百六十元、後零五角、HX嘜百四十二元、均小一元五角、車赤因存貨少、實銷需要、H嘜一百十八元、獨外一元、荷赤賂貨一百廿一元、現貨廿二元、計成交額數期貨四萬五千餘包、現貨五千餘包、</p>
<h3>金融　現黃金再小一百元　期貨有改弦易轍另謀發展說</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤上月期金因有另謀發展傳說、蓋自黑滙有消滅可能、外滙復釘住不放、期金才買賣、頓失擒縱之工具、所缺者爲結價之一法、本來標金結價、有用英金日金、旣而皆用美金、相沿已久、但做期貨者豈爲美金釘住、即默爾而息、大有以今日之淪陷區、日圓之勢力所能及、故頗有利用其票值變動、而爲日圓結價之傳聞、但日鈔非當初日金可比、好在今之期貨金市、亦非舊時之標金可比、聞昨日期貨成交一千餘兩、大都爲了結交易、供過於求、價已退至六千八百五十元關邊、續又軋小十七元、現金烚赤仍在各幫需買風中步跌、已退入八千九百元內、自晨首由天元進德孚二百兩、德成進祥和五十兩、爲九千元、比上日收價高十元、不久即見銳落、中興德成各出五十兩、合盛出六十兩、永成明豐各出二十兩、均成記買進、義豐出天元五—兩、合盛又出祥和十兩、價已退至八千九百五十元、誠達進德成二十兩、祥和進義豐出三十兩、提升至八千九百七十元、祥興永出成記二十兩、遜至八千九白五十元、新豐永進德成義豐各二十兩、抬至八千九百七十元、德成出天元三十兩、德孚出恒記十兩、爲八千九百六十元、午刻賣勢轉湧、下跌更銳、德孚出五十兩、祥和出十兩、均天元買進、聯興出德字二十兩、明豐出新豐永十兩、成記出合盛二十兩、已跌至八千九百元、後更有供無求、下午初開即低七十元、萬豐德成各出成記十兩、永豐出熾大公大各十兩、均爲八千八百三十元、立泰忽來進裕泰豐二十兩、永成十兩、均八千八百八十元、再進義豐五十兩、祥和二十兩、祥和旋又復進義豐與德成各三十兩均八千八百九十元、最後由成記出立泰二十兩、八千八百八十元、比上日軋小一百元、有一百七十元高低、金號本牌金門市售價八千九白五十元、收進减二百元、飾金亦掛低十元、計九百十元、</p>

<h3>證券　洋股漲風加厲　內債回風小起</h3>
<p>公公暗盤、昨市因連漲多日、居然小起回風、各債均回小六七角左右、市上爲浮多出籠、見利結出、大戶多頭仍屹然不動、行市已達高峰、回小數角、亦意中事．整個趨仍需視環境情形爲轉移、目下或再小數角、但終無大小面、丙種打破一元關、殊不易耳、昨上午九成號頗有吸收、故初開丙種尙在二元外、嗣以中孚潤德天生永昌均有賣出、雖聯和大中潤利尙有進胃、無奈賣仍壓力較重、遂被撳小二三角、午收即小二三四角、午後交易已淸、永昌略有買回、同順稍有加碼、上午所進之九成、午後又有復出、聯益鴻大亦有出籠、午後再小二三角、結果一致回鬆五角牛至七角、成交約計一百七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>霍金士·麥凱　昨召開金融會議十四家友邦銀行均出席　討論供給外匯實施辦法滬市物價自必需品供滙後可望轉機</h3>
<p>麥加利銀行總經理霍金士與花旅銀行監督麥凱、於前日乘克利扶倫總統輪返滬後、據負責方面傳出消息、兩氏將與本埠十四家銀行高級職員、舉行一會議、對本市外滙問題、作一重要決定、霍麥兩氏在港、雖未晤及美籍委員福克斯、但兩氏在港時、曾與其他委員、有從長商談、故返滬後所召集之上海銀行界會議、所討論之問題、不外關於新辦法實施方面爲多、目的在確定十四家銀行對委托者問之關係、以及對華商銀行間之關係、截至發稿時所得消息、此一會議、已於咋日下午二時舉行、大中社記者曾詢之麥加利銀行某高級職員、霍金士氏返滬後、有無新發展、據稱除公佈之九月份試行辦法及准許進口物品甲乙二表外、此外並無更張、惟可吿者、外商銀行決與平準會切實合作、此後決不買賣黑滙耳、」</p>
<p>四行昨起　辦理滙務</p>
<p>據大中社記者所得可靠消息、本市中中交農四行上海分行、自接奉命令後、即日起、與外商銀行同樣辦理平準會特准經營外滙之業務、故昨晨各行在國外匯兌部份方面、情形甚爲忙碌、供滙具體辦法及申請書係與正式命令同時頒到、所收到各件、計爲特准經營外滙銀行九月份試行辦法、及准許進口物品甲乙兩淸單各一份、及印就英文表格二種、一爲向平準會請求供給外滙之申請書、一爲銀行致平準會公函、至四行何時始開始爲其他各華商銀行代辦申請外滙業務、命令中並未涉及、據稱「四行爲其他各華商銀行代辦申請外滙業務、確有此決議、但尙未談妥、就現狀論、即可實行、此在四行方面、純爲義務性質、共應得佣金、即以歸之於委托代辦之華商銀行」、</p>

<h3>滬市物價　可望轉機</h3>
<p>新聲社記者昨日向各關係之消息靈通人士方面、探詢對於滬市物價問題之意見、所得之結論極爲一致而具體、認爲上海物價前途、可望樂觀、蓋自平準基金委員會通飭上海各指定銀行辦理必需品之供匯事務後、物價即有下趨之傾向、其直接與間接之理由有五、（一）中國法幣、因英美等友邦之支持、基礎更爲鞏固、而價値亦形堅挺、益以平準會之規定匯率、使法幣之購買力增加、造成物價回跌、（二）平準基金會決定之供匯物品、範圍廣泛、使進口商能按照優越之價格、獲得外匯、故凡准結匯之物品、其價格自可較以前爲低、其中尤以米·煤油·煤斤·食品·原料·糖·麥·穀類產品·及麵粉等最必需物品、得依賤價結匯、此爲搆成物價下跌之主因、（三）工部局港米、以後殆無上漲之勢、至少足以制止其他物價之繼續高昇、且兩租界當局、近頃決心取締非法抬價、投機市儈不得不有所顧忌、（四）近來船隻運輸之方便、漸趨進步、外洋交通、亦稍暢逹、使貨運往來、無虞中斷、滬市物品、不致遭遇斷擋之恐慌、於抑平物價、影響甚大、（五）上海局勢、已不再如上月中下句時之緊張、人心日趨安定、大量預購貨物之風頓戰、市儈無機可乘、物價自有回跌之可能、</p>
<h3>政院研討　遊資內移</h3>
<p>據哈瓦斯社十日重慶電稱、行政院現正邀集專家、硏究滬上游資、將以何種微妙方式、使之內移、但此種游資確數究有若干、並無可靠統計、惟據前日出版之日方每日新聞記載稱、本埠各銀行之存款、在一九三六年底中日戰事爆發以前、總計華幣十五萬萬元、至去年年底、已增至華幣二十八萬萬五千萬元、因此造成銀行對存款不給利息反而需索手續費之現象、</p>

<h3>黄海波濤洶湧　遊艇失事沉沒　兩少年壯志未酬僅以身免</h3>
<p>本月十日本報會譯載字林報消息、謂有瑞典水手駕舊游艇Ella號、從上海出發、欲冒險駛往馬尼刺、且有片舟橫渡太平洋之壯圖、茲據上海泰晤士報所載、該艇已在離滬八十哩之長江中、被巨浪擊沉、艇上僅斯幹的那維亞半島之靑年水手傑柯森與漢　兩人、幸皆精泅水術、始免葬身魚腹、前日午後、返抵本市中區、在某餐室飽餐一頓、蓋已四天未　美膳矣、兩氏所述經過如下、</p>

<p>當日午刻平穩出口、而入長江、不意勁風消逝、猛潮頓起、小艇順潮退回吳淞口、午後三時、重新駛出、平靜無事、八日晨艇入黃海、頓形小支、迭遭巨浪衝擊、其舵漸與艇尾脫離、海水亦有漏入、迄午、艇內積水益多、竭力戽出、終不能盡除艇中之水、欲修舵亦不可能、且海濤愈趨洶湧、乃決定駛返上海、甫入長江、離岸兩哩內、小艇已不能支持、舵與艇尾完全脫離、江水湧入艇中益急、遂吿下沉、兩氏僅以身逃出、在急潮中、脫去衣衫、僅剩內衣、向岸泅去、然被急潮所冲、祇得與岸平行而泅、在起伏不停之巨浪中、掙扎兩小時、精疲力竭、始在去艇沉沒地二哩半之處、爬行上岸、</p>
<p>狼狽登陸　幸獲生還</p>
<p>稍向內行、有一小村、村民見兩人之狼狽情景、咸覺愕然、事爲駐該村之日軍官所悉、疑兩人爲間諜、押入營房、詳加盤詰、傑柯森乃草一便條、由日兵送至駐滬瑞典領署、在營拘留兩天、至十日午刻、由日兵押送、乘火車至浦東某地下車、移交瑞典領署人員照料、始更衣返滬、</p>

<h3>魯迅三十年集</h3>
<p>— 雨林</p>
<p>魯迅先生逝世已經五週年，他底戰鬥精神，長留人問，且更廣大地展開着，深入靑年們底心，郭沫若先生說：「魯迅之前，無魯迅；魯迅之後，無數魯迅。」魯迅實在太偉大了。不錯，魯迅的時代眞是一個最苦悶的時代，它是光明與黑暗的過渡期，作爲正義感的知識份子的他，已把筆槍很淸楚地劃出這歷史的一頁，他固然沒有看到現在的民族解放戰爭，但他的推動的力量，已指示了千千萬萬的中國靑年。他底「夢裏依稀慈母淚城頭變幻大王旗」的史詩永遠存在，實爲時代文藝的不朽奇葩。他底尖厲的雜文，也是戰鬥陣營中的模範。有人說，他遞嬗了龔定　的思想形態，這是一種觀念論的解釋，他實在是中國的高爾基。</p>
<p>他是封建社會及資本社會中最奇特的戰士，他沒有落伍過，永遠站在時代的尖端。</p>
<p>魯迅先生紀念委員會在此時此地，於印行「魯迅全集」之後，再接再厲，又另外出版「魯迅三十年集，」來紀念這個偉人。精神是頗可欽佩的。</p>
<p>民國三十年印行魯迅創作三十年集，全書凡三十冊，這是很有意義的紀念。</p>
<p>三十年集這一名稱，是指的魯迅先生從一九零六年起至一九三六年間的一切著述而言。內容包括：創作小說如吶喊彷徨等；散文詩則有野帅；而墳集外集，集外集拾遺等，則含有文言，白話，詩歌等文字；其辛辣眞摯，以投槍匕首的姿態出現於文化領域，卓具風格；爲這一時代雜文的開山的，則自熱風起以迄且介亭雜文，共成十數冊之偉著。而前後精神一貫，則以振勵民族，掘發黑暗爲依歸。其他關於古小說，舊文學方面的正確整埋，我們從中國小說史略，渶文學史綱要，古小說鈎沈，嵇康集等的編著輯錄，可見一般。統計各書，共成二十九種。計三十巨冊。</p>
<p>早在一九三六年，據說先生即有意自行編印此集不幸旣病且死，未及親覩其成。現在在文化界人士愛護督勵，魯迅全集出版社諸先生熱誠努力之下，決定在本年九月問開始預的，十月間準期出書。</p>
<p>該集目决，據說乃依照著作，先後略加排比，其間一九二九年至三二的四年間，因先生致力於社會科學譯品等的介紹，致無暇兼顧於著作的印行。而遺憾的是：在魯迅先生自擬三十年集的第二個書目第十項中，有「起信三書」而未明指其意，或即包括嵇康集，謝承後渶書，嶺表錄異三種，而後二種至今未見。幸而此决出書，更有漢文學史綱要，及會嵇郡故書雜集；而集外集拾遺的分量，更超乎預先的充實。</p>
<p>「魯迅全集」再版很難，市上所存者又標價極貴，「魯迅三十年集」的印行，無疑是讀者的好機會。我們可拭目而待之罷。</p>

<h3>天倫之樂</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>「天下無不是的父母。」何以言之？天下之父母，其天性與子女原無不是之處，一切可出於至情至性：子女對於父母呢？也是如此。</p>
<p>本來，家庭應該是最合理的結合，融融洩混，享受天倫之樂，「左顧孺人，有弄稚子」，眞是人生之本來面目。歷史自有氏族社會，家族制度就圓滿地建立起來，旣而農奴社會，封建社會，而至資本社會，家庭形態雖有變化，其基石——天倫却永遠存在而發展着。我相信，社會一直發展，父母子女的情感也必保持於無窮。質之社會科學家也且信而有徵，不以爲唯心之論。</p>
<p>問題是在天倫的感情如何保持。唐太宗曾慨乎言之：治天下易，處家難。家庭原不同於大社會，父母子女間必竟須坦白而不敷衍，思想行動，互相諒解，這就是「體會」。父母子女本是兩時代的人物，各有其感觸和見解，但父母也是年靑過來了的，子女需要的却是生活經驗，雖各小異，無妨大同，大家和衷共濟，非不可能，而且沒有對立必要不，所以可求其「融洽」。</p>
<p>在縱的方面。有此一貫；橫的方面，也應合理。如果夫妻間有了勃谿，對於子女更是一重大痛苦，他們到最後竟會生出一種仇恨的心里理來。所以爲父母者亟應謀善意的防制。</p>
<p>單說子女忤逆，要看看子女行動的各方面，子女沒有天倫之樂，等於殺害自己半生。鄭莊公有「爾有母遺，緊我獨無」之嘆，這不是心底激發嗎？自然，子女有其幸福的前途，却須父母誘導，決無可爲第三者埋葬之理；萬一子女感到壓迫和羞恥，而甘願犧牲靑年的光明，那也是不値得的。所謂中　之羞難言之痛，決不是要讓下一代來負責的，那倒是父母的歉仄。</p>
<h3>廣告與商標　第一想到的是我</h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>有一天晚上，我和鏞在不甚熱鬧的路上默默地走着，突然，我發問：</p>
<p>「鏞，你說道條馬路那就一個頭鬧熱？」鏞抬起頭來張望一下，一時不能作答。</p>
<p>於是我指點着面前一家店舖橫縣路面的霓虹市招說：「是那邊熱鬧呀！」看云霓虹燈的字是反的。</p>
<p>因此我想商號碼，娛樂塲所的命名最好要像「百樂門」「小呂宋」「米高美」「金門」……那般，有時可以省掉另一面霓虹燈的裝一「客滿」霓虹是多麼好呀？一則可以叫人老遠就能望見，免得惹個「向隅」的沒趣，二則可表示道家戲院客滿是「家常便飯」。可以我從沒有向他人發表。</p>
<p>一個月前，我爲報上「徵求」（營謀）專才誠意合作」的分類廣告草擬我的計劃槪况如下：「（一）首創某奇異商標，可呈請注冊專用，其効用能使成本减少一半，且永遠不受原料漲價影響。（一）此項營業法可呈請專利。」</p>
<p>不過當我不久看到別的接連登了好幾天的徵求欄廣告：「專利新事業徵合作」，「投資新發明厚利實業」，我不知怎的就失去了投寄應徵的勇氣。</p>
<p>接着，七日報上載有：「律師代表烟草公司聲明使用「廣告牌」香烟啓事」。天啊！竟會就是我所想的「廣告牌香烟」，我巳替它打算過：如果每包壳面及烟枝各收廣告費五分或一角，即可减輕大半成本；並且計劃好　如何取得專利權以抵制日後極可能的「愛得物的門Advertisement」牌……</p>
<p>有誰知道你也會想到？如果你一點不聲張。但是說了又有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>爲人爲己　必須「事業服務化」　心源</p>
<p>在現在的地界上，一般人都爲了自己事業的利益均沾，不惜大家勾心鬥角，做出損人利己的行爲，造成人世間一切的不幸。因此，在家這裏，我要大聲疾呼地提倡：「事業服務化」。</p>
<p>什麼叫事業服務化呢？意思就是每個人認自己私人的事業，要像一種公共事業，我的從事此種事業，無異在替大衆服務，我必須顧到公衆的利益</p>
<p>我相信，每個人能抱如此的目的，來從事自己的事業，那人世間現有的不幸定可消滅不少。然而對自己方面，決不會損失，反而可以得到無上的利益。因爲人人能如此，在大衆的「互利」下，一定比「私利」要上算了。</p>
<p>現在舉一個例子，來强化你的意志：</p>
<p>就像法國的「居禮夫人」，她是治癌特效品「鐳」的發明者。當她很辛苦地在瀝靑礦石裏發見「鐳」以後，并不呈請專利，對於鐳的一切發現，一切提製手續，都原原本本地公布出來，甚至對於著作的「版權」也沒有保留。</p>
<p>他曾得到美國人士的同情，其後二次送給她二筆巨大的款子，但夫人却叫他們購買了鐳，一次是放在一個公共醫院裏，造福病人，一次做她自己研究的材料。夫人雖是鐳的發明者，但自己却沒有它呢！</p>
<p>你看了上面的例子，有動乎中麼？我不奢望每個人都像居禮夫人第二，但很希望做到她的十分之一二。</p>

<h3>狸案人物志</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>二　劉皇后</p>
<p>仁宗，爲本案之主要是角，劉皇后，爲本案中主角之主角。劉皇后，成都人，母夢月而後孕，幼在襁褓即孤，鞠飬於外家，及長，善播鼗，鼗者，搖鼓也。年十五，會有蜀人以鍛銀爲業之　美，携之入京，遂入襄王邸，襄王者，眞宗在潛邸時之封爵也。眞宗之乳母王氏性嚴整，爲太宗言之，令眞宗斥去，眞宗不得已，乃藏於王宮指使張耆家。</p>
<p>及太宗崩，眞宗即位，入爲美人，以其無宗族，命以　美爲第改姓劉。自郭皇后卒，眞宗即欲立爲后，大臣多以爲不可，故至大中祥符五年，始受冊封，時仁宗猶在襁褓中。眞宗崩，仁宗即位，以皇太后聽政者十一年，年六十五而崩。</p>
<p>從上列事實，而知眞宗寵愛劉后，始終弗替。至劉后何以能永得眞宗歡，當然，必有劉氏才貌個性，足可使君王傾心在；就史書以爲推敲，不難想像劉皇后之爲何等模型人。（一）何以一人襄王府，即不爲生性嚴整之王乳母所喜，甚至言之太宗，太宗亦欲逐去之而後巳，足見其「不嚴整」可知。而眞宗戀戀不捨，仍欲置之張耆家，以圖重聚，可見是「狐媚偏能惑主」之人物。（二）若專恃色寵亦不能久，蓋色衰而愛弛。史稱「后性警悟，曉書史，聞朝廷事能註其本末。眞宗退朝閱天下封奏，多至中夜，后皆預聞。宮　事有問，輒傳引故實以對。天禧四年，帝久疾居宮中，事多決於后。」以后如此人材，安得不傳眞宗顚倒，信任不衰。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>她原想說「不過暫時還不能就回來」，又怕說得太明顯了，便急着掉過了話鋒。</p>
<p>「不過，你老人家自己的身子是最要緊的，這幾天你瘦了許多，明兒我再給你送幾匣藕粉來吧」！在家孟家這一位小內掌櫃的單純的腦神經裏，藕粉彷彿是一種功效比人參還强的袖藥，因此逢到身體不好的人，她總要勸人家吃藕粉。</p>
<p>秋海棠對於她這種無知的好意，也祇能順口道了幾聲謝便完事，實際上，他也未嘗不懷疑這女人對於梅寶失踪的事，心裏多少有些兒明白，可是他知道是不敢說的，所以也就懶得問了。</p>
<p>也許就爲他不聽孟家的媳婦的話，沒有吃藕粉，以致他的精神後來是越發衰疲；儘管他每天還勉强打坑上掙扎起來，但見到了他的人，總免不了要大驚小怪的問：</p>
<p>「怎麼你：又害病了」？</p>
<p>事實上，他的確已經病了！及至方校長的第二封信寄到，他每天所吃的東西，差不多就祇一碗小米粥。</p>
<p>第二封信上的消息，似乎到比第一封信好些。（二〇九）</p>

<h3>兪振飛下海之經過（上）  少閒（自北平寄）</h3>
<p>提起程現秋和兪振飛這一擋事，我要另用筆法，先從程硯秋的配角小生一層上說起。當程現秋自行組班之初，他的配角中有一部份是春陽友會下海的票友，這幾位角色雖是票友下海，但是的確幫助現秋成名，那就是小生生又荃，老生郭仲衡，老旦文亮臣這幾個人。那時正是羅癭公金仲蓀等狂捧硯秋的時代，羅金二人接連爲硯秋編排不少新戲，這些新戲中，即以王郭文三人佔最重的地位，所以硯秋對此三人視若左右手。忘記是那一年的事所動，於是紛紛離硯秋而捧遏雲。硯秋經此一變，內部大受影響，幸硯秋高度有方，得能化險爲夷，依然渡過難關。否則硯秋經王又荃之倒戈，眞將有礙大局，或恐無今日的地位。而王之辣手，至今硯秋不能忘也。王又荃自離硯秋後，因與硯秋配戲多年，硯秋之私房本戲，王皆能之，即以此爲號召，初與章遏雲合作，後則爲新艶秋配戲，今日之下，遏雲玉華（新艶秋）所唱之程派本戲，即當年又荃所授也。</p>
<p>袁雪芬，爲四季春班領導，丙爲大來劇院當家花旦，扮相淸脆，舉止端重，飾大家閨秀，尤怡合身分，彼與馬樟花合演「梁祝哀史」「三看御妹」等劇，俱有特異之點，堪稱珠聯璧合。作工細賦，每演至精警處，恒令觀者神往，自樟花嬪人後，離大來自組新班，聞者莫不深惜</p>
<p>— 冰宜夫人</p>
<h3>魏如晦的童話劇</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>魏如晦繼「桃花源」之後，又寫了第二部童話劇「牛郎織女傳。」作者利用弗洛以德的精神分析學，眞境裏的壞人在夢境裏都變成魔鬼，好人都獎成神仙，在這一點上，的確與「綠野仙踪」電影有「異曲同工之妙。」</p>
<p>這戲的含義很是深刻，尋找幸福一點使我聯想到梅特林克的「靑鳥」。年郎織女傳倘若可以稱爲「喜鵲」或「幸福鳥」之類吧？這眞是東西媲美的佳話了！不過，像「靑鳥」「彼得潘」之類總不免做着童話的好夢，僅只給兒童以溫馨與陶醉，並不會揭示醜惡的現實，因此自始至終像是薄霧輕紗，給人以柔滑的感覺，而不能使人警惕與猛省。可是，與如晦的童話劇相偕以來的却多少有些恐怖，加以含義甚深，我以爲宜於高小和初中一二年級的學生觀看，希望爲父母者能夠携帶子女去欣賞這有意義的童話劇；至於初小學生，我認爲是不適宜的。</p>
<p>作者是改良平劇的一員，久有意與金素琴張翼鵬等合作，此次也實現了一部分的理想，却是話劇平劇化。例如：第一幕織女（沈　）唱牙牌詞就用的是吹腔（販馬記斬經堂百花亭之類的調子）。第二幕魔王口中噴火好像鐘馗嫁妹或火判等崑戲，狐虎狼狗兎等動作，均經張翼鵬指導，尤以金素琴所敎的蛇精動作爲妙。第四幕石猴翻觔斗，第五幕女神（藍蘭）跳舞，衆仙子耍綢子，按着鼓聲（霸王別姬打鼓罵曹之類的調子）唱歌：凡此，都是平劇中所常可看到聽到的，現在都搬到話劇裏來了。</p>
<p>「此一對農村情侶，以其堅苦不拔之志，終成眷屬。」猛然間，我想到了芬蘭哀禾的「先驅」。</p>
<h3>天宮將演「石榴裙下」</h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>天宮劇塲自與中旅訂約開始長期公演以來，「葡萄美酒」一劇，大受觀衆之歡迎，賣座之盈，打破記錄。此劇原擬至多演兩星期，即換新節目，不意愈演愈盛，欲罷不能，祗得繼續下去，現已超過三星期，全部演員雖始終賣力不衰，但因演期過長，且該劇又未採用AB制，故演員如孫景路，趙恕等，均曾經有若干日係抱病登台。茲悉該團昨已決定「葡萄美酒」演至十五日止，不再繼續，蓋預定之「石榴裙下」，「碧血黃沙」，「董小宛」各劇，除「董小宛」尙未排練竣工外，其餘兩劇，均巳完全排妥，故自十六日起，決定換演五幕大喜劇「石榴裙下」，聞此劇係一噱頭極多之喜劇，數年前，當中旅在北平時，曾應淸華大學之請，在該校演出是劇，塲內之笑聲，幾使台上無法進行表演，由此亦可見一斑矣。</p>

<p>寒暄後，田宏遇便對吳三桂說道：「素慕將軍神武之姿，前日在皇帝賜宴上得識荊州，非常榮幸。老朽久欲和將軍締交，惜無機會，現逢將軍奉召，駐節在京，所以老夫專誠奉請將軍虎駕責臨寒舍一敘，以修永好。在寒舍平日蓄有女樂一隊，無非爲娛悅天年，稍慰桑榆之用。靡靡之音，尙堪入耳，倘蒙將軍許諾，明夜當潔治壺觴，盛設女樂，請將軍一爲顧曲周郎何如？」吳三桂起初推辭說有君命在身，即日須出關處理，軍務倥惚，不敢爲遊觀之樂。後經田宏遇再三强請，方纔允許一至。其實吳三桂本是好色的武人，不過當着田宏遇之面，裝腔作勢，故意推却，不便一請就許可罷了。况且他也聞得自己聞名未得的江南第一美人陳圓圓正在田宏遇邸中爲女樂班首，自己本想一飽眼福而未能，難得田宏遇親自跑上門來相請，在吳三桂眼裏看來，這也是一個大好機會，豈可裝着假道學到底，而失之交臂呢？可憐田老頭兒昏蒙老邁，不知人家的心襄呢。他見吳三桂巳允前去，不勝歡喜，又略談數語，告知而歸。把見吳的經過告訴了圓圓，敎　明晚要管領女樂當有一翻預備。圓圓聽了，暗暗歡喜。到了明天，田宏遇吩咐家人內外治供具，一切盛設，無不格外華鹿。又命諸樂女歌唱彈奏，各要盡力且不可失禮儀，也使吳將軍不至小覷田家的女樂，衆人自然奉命惟謹。將近天晚時，田宏遇巳派家人在門前探望，但等吳將軍駕到，即入通報。他自己換上衣冠，坐在四維堂上守候。（一六六）</p>

<h3>U.S. Presidential Broadcast Speech Eve: White House Holds Important Meeting; Major Decisions on International Situation Expected; U.S. Congress to Convene Early on the 15th</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 11th - President Roosevelt arrived in Washington on the evening of the 10th via special train from Hyde Park. The President immediately met at the White House with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Colonel Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 11th - Members of the House of Representatives were summoned yesterday to convene in Washington on the 15th, canceling the previously scheduled meeting for September 22nd. President Roosevelt summoned Congressional leaders to the White House this morning. Given these circumstances, there is widespread belief that significant developments are imminent regarding the international situation.</p>
<p>United Press International, En Route to Washington on the President's Special Train, 10th - President Roosevelt's convening of a meeting with the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy on the evening of the 10th indicates that a major decision will be made regarding the international situation. The President's international broadcast speech on the evening of the 11th has been extended from the originally planned fifteen minutes to twenty-five minutes. The President's speech, it is said, has been heavily revised due to recent developments. Observers speculate that the President's summoning of legislative leaders from both houses of Congress will involve discussing the possibility of repealing the Neutrality Act. They recall that President Roosevelt mentioned in his Labor Day address that the United States needs to increase its shipping to protect the transport of wartime supplies to countries resisting the Axis powers. Many also speculate that the President's speech on Thursday evening will include a request for naval protection of ships transporting war materials to the enemies of the Axis powers. Furthermore, it is said that the President may take stronger naval actions to prevent the plundering of American ships. Observers suggest that the President may also indicate that he will ask Congress to repeal the Neutrality Act so that American ships can operate in the ports of Britain or other belligerent nations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 11th - According to dispatches from President Roosevelt's special train, the President has completed his speech on foreign affairs and is scheduled to deliver it from the White House at 11:00 PM Shanghai time on the 12th. The President finished drafting his speech at his home in Hyde Park before boarding the train to Washington and instructed his secretariat to arrange meetings with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of War Stimson in Washington. When asked by President's Secretary Hassett whether these discussions were related to the broadcast speech, Hassett replied, "You can guess for yourself." The President was accompanied by his wife, and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins boarded the President's special train in New York and traveled with them to Washington.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 11th - President Roosevelt's convening of a cabinet meeting and the reconvening of Congress next Monday have led many to believe that the President is now making demands to prepare for the immediate repeal of the Neutrality Act, or at least to substantially amend it. The reason Congress is convening a week earlier is clearly to expedite the passage of the government's new tax revenue bill. It is also understood that the President's speech will be broadcast nationwide and relayed via shortwave in fourteen languages.</p>
<h3>Repeal of Neutrality Act Request: Senate Likely to Pass It</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 11th - The President will meet with leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress at the White House this morning. They will likely discuss the amendment or repeal of the Neutrality Act. This morning's meeting will undoubtedly be a continuation of last night's meeting, as the President met with the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy at the White House for an hour and a half last night, and no statement was issued afterward. It is noted that the President convened leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties at the White House on May 27th, which was before the President delivered his fireside chat declaring an unlimited national emergency. Currently, members of Congress have been expressing strong criticism of official suggestions that the President, due to incidents such as the torpedoing of the U.S. destroyer Greer and the frequent sinking of American ships, has decided to request that Congress repeal the Neutrality Act. However, members of Congress who support the executive branch favor repealing the Neutrality Act. According to informal surveys in the Senate, it has become clear that if the President requests the repeal of the Neutrality Act, the Senate will likely pass it, with no more than thirty or so dissenting votes. Congressional leaders generally believe that if the President requests that Congress repeal the Neutrality Act, the President can hope to achieve three purposes: (1) To abolish the war zones declared in accordance with current regulations, allowing American ships to transport items stipulated under the Lend-Lease Act to ports currently prohibited, such as Murmansk and Arkhangelsk in Soviet territory; (2) To arm merchant ships, which is currently prohibited. If the Neutrality Act is repealed, merchant ships can be armed, allowing them to defend themselves against attacks from aircraft and submarines, avoiding the fate of ships like the Sessa and Steel Seafarer; (3) To provide military escorts or other methods to protect American ships transporting American military supplies to countries resisting the Axis powers.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 11th - President Roosevelt, in preparation for his broadcast speech tonight, reportedly consulted with his advisors on the latest international situation. It is said that in this speech, the President will respond to Germany's three challenges to America's maritime freedom policy. The White House today declined to comment on the content of the President's speech, only emphasizing that it is extremely important.</p>
<h3>Taylor's Audience with the Pope Related to U.S. Aid to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>United Press International, Vatican City, 11th - Pope Pius XII received Roosevelt's personal representative, Mr. Taylor, in a private audience yesterday afternoon at half-past six. It is widely believed that the Pope had originally planned to receive him today but moved it up one day at Taylor's request. Taylor said, "My private audience with the Pope yesterday lasted for forty-five minutes. Today, I will meet with the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, and I will have another audience with the Pope next week. I will return to the United States on September 22nd." Well-informed sources believe that Taylor discussed certain key points of President Roosevelt's forthcoming speech with the Pope. It is expected that Cardinal Maglione's reply today will be telegraphed to Washington. It is considered quite significant that Taylor met with Cardinal Maglione before his audience with the Pope, and that he will visit the Vatican Secretary of State again before Roosevelt's speech. Most Vatican observers believe this is related to American aid to the Soviet Union, especially in obtaining the Pope's support to reduce opposition from American Catholics to such aid.</p>
<p>Havas, Vatican City, 10th - When Taylor had an audience with the Pope on the evening of the 10th, he informed him of President Roosevelt's attitude toward the Soviet Union and stated that the United States is particularly concerned with the welfare of the Soviet people, regardless of the Soviet government's organization.</p>

<h3>China Focuses Attention on U.S.-Japan Talks</h3>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 11th - On the eve of President Roosevelt's broadcast, people here are focusing their attention on the U.S.-Japan discussions. Some still believe that it is possible for the U.S. and Japan to reach a compromise, while others believe that no resolution will be reached. According to reliable Chinese sources in Washington received here, the U.S.-Japan discussions have not yielded any solution. American sources here also hold the same view. It is said that the United States will not reach a compromise with Japan on the Far East situation unless a fundamental solution is achieved. Therefore, although there have been rumors of a temporary agreement between the U.S. and Japan, that possibility no longer exists, as the fundamental conditions set by the U.S. do not seem acceptable to Japan.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 11th - Chugai Shogyo, which often reflects the policies of the current Japanese cabinet, suggested in a commentary today that Japan and the United States should reconcile and eliminate tensions that could lead to war. The newspaper stated that the United States and Japan should conduct the broadest study of the issues hindering friendly relations between the two countries, as there is still a chance to avoid armed conflict. The newspaper pointed out that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to maintain peace, not to promote war, but since Japan adhered to the pact, the United States has increased its pressure on Japan, creating the risk of promoting war. The newspaper also stated that Japan does not want outside interference in its East Asian program, but Japan's main goal is to establish permanent stability in East Asia.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Says Situation in Pacific is Improving; First Shipment of American Tanks Arrives in Australia</h3>
<p>International News Service, Sydney, 11th - Australian Prime Minister Fadden stated that the Australian government has received official information that the situation in the Pacific appears to be improving. He added that he is in close contact with London and Washington regarding the Far East situation. Before Fadden made the above remarks, Australian Secretary of War Spender announced that the first shipment of American-made tanks had arrived in Australia, and that more American-made military supplies would be shipped to Australia in a steady stream.</p>
<h3>Hull Tells Reporters U.S.-Japan Talks Have No New Developments; U.S. Warned Japan Not to Make Southward or Northward Moves</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 11th - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had no news of an imminent agreement or announcement regarding the U.S.-Japan talks, which have been ongoing for months. In fact, there have been no new developments in the U.S.-Japan situation. A reporter asked if it was true that a U.S.-Japan agreement would soon be announced, as rumored in Shanghai. Hull replied that he once encountered a very clever reporter who asked him a question, and he thought it was wise, or perhaps unwise, not to tell him everything he wanted to know. The reporter then said that even if he didn't hear anything, he would write about it anyway. Hull added that he imagined there must be several gentlemen in Shanghai with plenty of time on their hands who are busy writing.</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 11th - Diplomatic envoys here stated yesterday that they confirmed that Washington had warned Japan against making any further northward or southward moves. This warning was reportedly issued early in the U.S.-Japan negotiations, which have been ongoing for three weeks. It was also learned that this warning included a request that Japan not interfere with the shipment of American military supplies to Vladivostok in aid of the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles also stated that if the U.S. warning to Japan included the threat of southward or northward expansion by Japan, then the value of the democratic countries' aid to the Soviet Union would be extremely significant.</p>
<h3>U.S. Actively Training New Marine Corps; Torleif to Take on Important Position</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 11th - After President Roosevelt approved the promotion of Brigadier General Torleif to the rank of Major General, the Navy Department announced last night that Torleif would be transferred from Commander of the 1st Marine Division at Quantico to Commander of the New River Marine Corps Base. The new Marine Corps is now formally training at that base. At the same time, the Navy Department also announced that Brigadier General Lowe had also been promoted to Major General and transferred to the Intelligence Division. The President has also approved this transfer. It is expected that Torleif will play an important role in supervising the organization of the new Marine Corps in the Atlantic. This new Marine Corps will receive special training in lightning-fast landing operations and attacking coastal installations. The new Marine Corps will be equipped with the latest and most powerful weapons and will use new-style barges and other modern landing equipment. Torleif has served in the Pacific, the Caribbean, and Europe. Lowe is a renowned aviator who has served in Cuba, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Haiti, and France. He will serve as Chief of the Intelligence Division.</p>
<h3>Japanese Students Nationwide Receive Military Training; Organization Is Identical to the Army</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 11th - According to an order issued yesterday by the Ministry of Education, all middle schools and universities in Japan will organize school teams into student armies so that all students can receive systematic preliminary military training. The organizational methods will be identical to those of the army, with the principal serving as the commander and officers from the army serving as advisors to the school. In the case of Waseda University, for example, it will be divided into twelve battalions or twenty-six companies. Elementary school students will also receive the same training.</p>
<h3>Britain Provides Assurance to U.S. Regarding Use of Lend-Lease Goods; Determined Not to Divert Them for Private Commercial Use; No Barter Agreement Between Britain and Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - The British government has published a White Paper containing correspondence between the British and American governments. In this document, the British government provides the U.S. government with a firm assurance regarding the use of American Lend-Lease goods. British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday sent a memorandum to U.S. Ambassador Winant, stating in brief that all materials received by Britain under the Lend-Lease Act are necessary for prosecuting the war. The British government has taken and will continue to take steps to ensure that these materials are not diverted for the purpose of increasing private profits. Lend-Lease goods imported into Britain will not be re-exported, and the British government will not supply exporters with the same goods, opening up new markets or expanding export trade to the detriment of the United States. However, this does not include raw materials needed overseas to manufacture necessary war materials for the United States and the Allied powers that cannot be obtained directly from the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - In the House of Commons, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Economic Warfare, Foot, spoke regarding the Japan barter agreement. Foot stated that Britain has not intended to enter into a general barter agreement with Japan or to take any action inconsistent with the implementation of the freezing orders. Frozen funds will not be allowed to be used for new exports to Japan. If licenses are occasionally issued for the exceptional need for certain special goods to be imported into Britain from Japan, consideration must be given to what goods should be shipped to Japan and how they should be paid for. If necessary, it would be best to establish a separate clearing account. However, no licenses for such imports have been issued at present, so there is no payment issue.</p>
<h3>British and Soviet Control of Iranian Transportation Lines; German and Italian Nationals All Arrested</h3>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 11th - British and Soviet forces, in accordance with the agreement with Iran, have obtained control of key transportation lines within Iran, including the vital Trans-Iranian Railway.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - The 48-hour deadline set by British and Soviet authorities for the extradition of German nationals from Iran has now expired. All German and Italian nationals have been arrested and taken to major centers within Iran. Most will likely be detained within Iran, but there is also the possibility of them being moved to India.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - As a result of British and Soviet actions in Iran, Germany has not only lost a large supply of food but can no longer obtain large quantities of cotton, ramie, and boxwood. An expert from the British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated yesterday that Germany will lose 18,000 to 20,000 tons of cotton annually as a result. The shortage of cotton in Germany can be seen in the forced confiscation of most of the bedding of Jews in Germany. The ramie that Germany imported from Iran is also no longer available, further exacerbating the ramie shortage. Iranian boxwood is of excellent quality, and Germany used it to manufacture instruments for filling bombs and shells, as well as instruments used in mathematics.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China's Unchanging Established Policy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, in analyzing US-Japan relations, touched on the Sino-Japanese issue, stating that regardless of whether the US-Japan talks involved this, there was no need for excessive worry or suspicion, but due to space constraints, the wording was not detailed. It is fortunate that last night we learned of Chairman Chiang's statement to the Associated Press regarding China's position, and we wish to continue the previous discussion and elaborate on it further.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese war has lasted for four years. For China, it is an unprecedentedly long-term and comprehensive foreign war, while for Japan, the wartime suffering that it had never experienced in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, is now being personally experienced in the war against China. The shortage of manpower and material resources, and the major international repercussions, have all exceeded what Japan can endure. Chairman Chiang stated the day before yesterday that the Japanese military's combat power has been greatly weakened and is already at the end of its rope. This is a fact that is universally recognized, and even the Japanese themselves find it difficult to conceal or deny. However, although their strength is depleted, their desires have not diminished. The Japanese still yearn for the strength and prosperity that the First World War brought to Japan. Based on this idea, there was the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and the brewing of southward and northward advances. However, considering the facts, even in the previous World War, Japan repeatedly disregarded its treaty obligations (the Anglo-Japanese Alliance), pursuing only its own interests, which caused the Allied countries to view it with suspicion. Although during the war, they could not avoid the dilemma of "hesitating to strike the rat for fear of breaking the vase," after the peace conference, the Washington Conference was used to restrain its limitless expansionist ambitions. In the past year, regardless of Japan's basic beliefs regarding the Tripartite Alliance, judging from what has been shown recently, it is clear that they have been disappointed with the future of the Axis powers, and have instead used this as a basis for threatening and extorting the nation. On the American side, because they earnestly hope for peace in the Pacific and believe that Japan can be coerced into submission, the US-Japan talks have been carried out. However, if the Axis powers' hopes were still as they were in the past and Japan's strength had not been damaged, it would certainly not be willing to conduct discussions with the United States under the frequent waving of the American club. This newspaper discussed this yesterday. Judging from Japan's consistent style, the past events of the previous World War have been described above. As for the recent situation, the Tripartite Alliance is the center of gravity of its national policy for many years, and now there are signs of gradual divergence. Japan has neutral obligations to the Soviet Union, a friendly nation, and it is still resentful of American oil shipments to the Soviet Union. Therefore, even if the US-Japan talks are successful, whether this new partner can be trusted and whether the Pacific can be worry-free are certainly not guarantees that anyone dares to make lightly. Even within the American authorities, they may not place too much weight on Japan's promises. On the one hand, they are negotiating with Japan, and on the other hand, they are stepping up support for China. The meaning and value of the statement "China is America's great defense" have not changed due to the US-Japan talks.</p>
<p>Japan is urgently seeking to hold talks with the United States because it cannot withstand the economic pressure from the democratic countries, and even more so because the war against China cannot be ended. The latter is the central difficulty. If most of its strength had not been consumed in the four years of long and arduous fighting, the extreme elements' grand pronouncements of not hesitating to go to war might have been adopted as Japan's current foreign policy. Even if Britain and the United States wanted peace in the Pacific, it would be impossible. In the past four years, China has stood firm as the only pillar of the democratic camp in the Far East. Even when the major powers of the world could not avoid being polite to it, China has always stood firm and has not wavered in its firm stance. For this reason, and because the democratic countries have turned from danger to safety and have enough strength to deal with the Far East, economic sanctions have been able to demoralize Japan. Although its fundamental idea of expansion remains as before, at present, it cannot help but slightly restrain its actions and instead hope to alleviate its predicament through negotiations. However, China's struggle and economic sanctions complement each other and reinforce each other. It should not be lightly abandoned before Japan has changed its fundamental stance. Chairman Chiang pointed out: "On the one hand, China will continue to fight, and on the other hand, economic sanctions against Japan will be intensified, or at least not relaxed." "This is a mutually understood agreement among the countries concerned in the Pacific," and it is also the only way to stop expansion and restore order in the Far East.</p>
<p>The general counter-offensive of the Chinese army has been commonly hoped for by Chinese and foreign people in recent years. In the past, there have been repeated rumors that it would be realized this autumn, but it has been delayed until now and has not been launched, which may inevitably disappoint some people. However, it must be understood that for the Chinese army, which has always been at a disadvantage in terms of equipment and armaments, to achieve satisfactory results in the counter-offensive, it cannot rely solely on determination, courage, and manpower, and there must be sufficient preparation. The American Lend-Lease Act was only passed and implemented this spring, just a few months ago, and in the past, the focus was still on supporting Britain. The delivery of large quantities of supplies to China and the dispatch of military advisors are recent matters. With the development of British industry, the strength of its national power, and the large-scale supply of American war equipment, it has not yet been able to take advantage of the opportunity of the major war on the Eastern Front to launch a large-scale counter-offensive. It is therefore not surprising that China's general counter-offensive has been delayed. However, since the supreme military commander of China stated to American reporters the day before yesterday that he would fight to the end and make the necessary sacrifices, this is no different from an indirect announcement of the launch of the Chinese army's counter-offensive. Ten days ago, the Chinese army in various areas of the Eastern Theater launched several local counter-offensives, achieving considerable results and recovering several important towns. Recently, there have also been new and wise measures in the financial and fiscal areas, and the rear provinces have generally had bumper harvests, greatly reducing the threat of food shortages. All of this is enough to enhance the confidence of victory. Therefore, no matter whether the outcome of the US-Japan talks is temporary peace or a change for the worse, it is not enough to determine the basic trend in the Far East. Everything thereafter will mainly depend on China's continued struggle.</p>
<h3>Central District Front 200 Miles: Soviet-German Tank Battle; Germans Retreat on Upper Reach of the Dnieper, Fierce Battle for Leningrad Underway</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: It is reported that General Timoshenko's troops are launching offensives at three locations on a 200-mile front stretching from 40 miles northeast of Smolensk to Gomel.</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 11th: The Red Army High Command reported today that the large-scale retreat of German forces along the 200-mile central front is continuing. The three-pronged Soviet offensive has pushed the German forces across the upper reaches of the Dnieper River, forcing them closer to the important central areas of Smolensk and Gomel. The scale of this German retreat is only seen since the collapse of the German army in 1918. The current Soviet offensive is being personally directed by Marshal Timoshenko. The Soviet army has eliminated more than 80,000 German soldiers, hundreds of tanks, and countless other military equipment. The German army's fierce bombing of Leningrad to force its surrender has failed. However, only a few German planes penetrated the heavily defended city of Leningrad, causing several fires within the city.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: According to the latest news received, the fierce battle for Leningrad is still underway and has not diminished in intensity. In the central district, General Timoshenko's Soviet troops are inflicting new blows on the German forces. Last night, the Germans reported that Soviet tanks and infantry attacked German positions approximately 40 miles northeast of Smolensk. News from Moscow also stated that a major tank battle is taking place in the area south of Smolensk, with German and Austrian casualties reaching as high as 80,000. The Soviet army in the Gomel area to the south is currently launching a major counter-offensive in an attempt to halt the German advance on Kyiv. At the same time, at the northern end, the German forces attempting to break through the defenses of Leningrad have suffered heavy casualties. Germany is now sparing no effort to advance in order to quickly achieve victory, and claims to have gathered the largest number of aircraft to attack the fortifications of Leningrad. Yesterday, London clearly received broadcasts directly from the front line by the Leningrad radio station, where the rumble of artillery, the commands of Soviet artillery officers, and all the sounds of battle could be heard simultaneously, giving a clear impression of Timoshenko leading his troops in fierce battle against the enemy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th: A war report from "Red Star" stated that General Timoshenko's Soviet troops, in a fierce counter-offensive southeast of Smolensk, have driven the German forces back to the opposite bank of the "N" River, and destroyed 238 German tanks, 50 aircraft, 486 trucks, and 135 artillery pieces. Approximately 4,000 German soldiers drowned in the river. Although this statement does not specify the name of the river, the Dnieper River meanders south between Smolensk and Yartsevo (which has been recovered by the Soviet army), 45 miles southeast of the city. The "Red Star" report also stated that "our brave troops continued to fight, destroying enemy soldiers and equipment, and forcing the German forces to retreat to the opposite bank of the river. The German commander in this area has gathered several tank divisions and mechanized units to make a wedge-shaped incursion, intending to advance east. The Soviet Air Force has been fiercely attacking the enemy's rear day and night for several days, and tanks have also been fighting alongside aircraft, continuing for five days. Soviet tanks have fiercely attacked the enemy's columns, and the enemy has tried to prevent our army from advancing. The battle for the crossing points is particularly fierce. Our army finally broke through the enemy's resistance, and the battle to defeat the enemy's mechanized units is continuing."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: It is rumored that the Soviet army has recovered the Smolensk city area, but the Soviet side has not yet confirmed or denied this. Within a few days, there may be no trace of German troops in the Dnieper River, and as a result of the Soviet counter-offensive, the threat of the German army encircling the Soviet army defending the Dnieper River from the north will be completely eliminated. If this is the case, then if the German side wants to seize the remaining half of Ukraine, it must forcibly cross the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and launch a frontal assault.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Attack Leningrad, Fierce Air Battle Erupts</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th: A Soviet communiqué stated that on the 9th, several formations of German aircraft raided Leningrad, but each time they were repelled by Soviet air force and anti-aircraft fire. However, at approximately 10:00 PM, several German aircraft separately flew to Leningrad, flying very high, and dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs on various parts of the city, resulting in several residential areas catching fire. The Soviet Air Force and anti-aircraft guns destroyed a total of 31 German aircraft inside and outside Leningrad, and while attacking enemy airfields.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 10th: This radio station recently broadcast a message stating that air battles between the German and Soviet air forces occurred in the sky today, with a total of 17 Soviet aircraft shot down.</p>
<h3>German and Finnish Armies Join Forces, First Snowfall in Northern Finland</h3>

<h3>Odessa's Defenses Remain Strong After Being Besieged for Nearly a Month</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: According to the Soviet official TASS news agency, after being besieged for nearly a month, the garrison of the major Black Sea port of Odessa is increasingly determined. All residents of the area have been ordered to defend the city. News leaked from Romania stated that the Romanian side is shocked by the heavy losses of its troops. The Romanian army, advancing on Odessa, has made no progress in a month.</p>
<p>TASS, Odessa, 11th: The unity and dedication of the entire city of Odessa are unprecedented. The entire city has been active since early morning. Male and female workers are rushing to work in factories, while young women are serving in hospitals. Women and children are carrying buckets and shovels, building fortifications. Strong fortifications have been built around Odessa, capable of resisting heavy artillery fire. Factories are working hard to accelerate production, and all supplies for the defense of the city are being rapidly manufactured. Workers have taken up guns to defend their city, fighting bravely at the city gates.</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Attack Italy, Turin Armory Bombed</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: Last night, several British heavy bombers carried out an unprecedentedly fierce bombing raid in northern Italy. The Italian Royal Armory in Turin was also among those bombed, causing a fire that was very intense. The last time British aircraft bombed northern Italy was in January of this year, when bombs were dropped in Turin and near Marghera port near Venice. Reuters, Rome, 11th: A communiqué from the Italian Supreme Command stated that British aircraft bombed Genoa, Turin, and Messina.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: A communiqué from the Air Raid Department stated that British aircraft raided Italy last night, with one team bombing the northern industrial area and another bombing the extreme end of Sicily. The bombers used by the British side were four-engine Stirling (Britain's largest bomber), four-engine Halifax, and various two-engine types, making at least a 1,600-mile non-stop flight.

<h3>The Sorrow of a Defeated Nation: Vichy Bears the Maintenance Costs of the German Army, Reaching 400 Million Francs Per Day</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: It is heard from well-informed diplomatic sources in neutral countries that negotiations between Vichy and Germany to reduce the maintenance costs of the occupying forces have been going on for some time, but have now reached a stalemate. This fee is still paid at the original figure of 400 million francs per day. Earlier this year, Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan mentioned the generosity of the Germans, saying that the occupation fee had been reduced. The failure of the current negotiations is probably because Vichy cannot or is unwilling to pay the occupation fee in gold.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Hunan Launch Major Incursion, Met with Fierce Interception by Chinese Troops; Fierce Battle in Southern Shanxi, Japanese Repelled; Chinese Troops Achieve Results in Northern Jiangxi and Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News: (1) The Japanese troops stirring up trouble in Northern Hunan continue to increase. On the 7th, one route invading Nanshan, Gaoling, and Jianjiaqiao from Zhongfang was increased to over 9,000, with three additional routes totaling over 3,000. In the afternoon, they invaded the Mengcheng Nancong area. On the same day, one route invading from Taolin Xitang was also increased to over 5,000, invading the areas of Jipocen and Caoxiecen, with one route of over 1,000 invading the areas of Changanqiao and Gantian. The Chinese army is intercepting the invading Japanese troops in the vicinity of these areas, while also dispatching powerful units to encircle the Japanese from the rear, and fierce battles have begun, with all units fiercely attacking the Japanese. (2) A certain unit of the Chinese army in the triangular area of Southern Shanxi launched a fierce attack on the Japanese stronghold of Dalizhuang in the morning of the 3rd. The battle was fierce until noon, and the Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, retreated into the village to resist stubbornly. The Chinese troops followed and pursued them into the village, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. By about 3:00 PM, the Japanese had been killed or wounded by more than half. Subsequently, the Japanese sent reinforcements from five routes: one route of over 300 via Paochangkou from Anyi through the east, one route of 600 to 700 through the salt ponds, one route of over 200 from Bazheng through Fengxie Village, and one route of over 100 from Zhangcun through Huojun Temple, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. The Japanese in the village also took the opportunity to launch a counterattack on the Chinese army. Deng Yun, the commander of a certain unit of the Chinese army, was once trapped by the Japanese, but he fought bravely and killed many of the Japanese who were besieging him, breaking out of the village. Battalion Commander Luo rushed to his rescue, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese. The Chinese reserve forces arrived, and after fierce fighting until midnight, they repelled the Japanese who were counterattacking from the village, switching from the inner line to the outer line to continue attacking the Japanese with mobile tactics. (3) A certain unit of the Chinese army in Northern Jiangxi launched an attack on the Japanese in Changbu, west of Nanchang, last month. They encountered the Japanese at Mumacun Xiashanyang. The Japanese again sent reinforcements from Xiangfang. After fierce fighting all day, the Chinese army bravely defeated them, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers and seizing some military supplies. (4) A certain unit of the Chinese army in Northern Hubei attacked Zhangjiawan, west of Dushongshan (south of Suixian), on the evening of the 5th, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers.

On the morning of the 3rd, a unit of Japanese troops from Yimenji, northwest of Guoyang, used six cars to harass Baimiaoji in Northern Hao. They were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army's guerrillas and local militia, killing many Japanese soldiers and seizing many spoils of war. The Japanese fled back along the original route. On the afternoon of the 5th, the Japanese troops in Anyang invaded Guojia, southwest of the city. After fierce fighting with a certain unit of the Chinese army until night, they were finally repelled by the Chinese army, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops retreated to Anyang in defeat (November 11th dispatch). The Japanese troops in Xingji, Wanquan, Jiwangshan, Zhangba, and other places have been harassing the northwestern area of Jiwangshan in groups since the 3rd.

<p>Japanese Troops Along PingSui Railway Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Yulin: A certain unit of the Chinese army along the PingSui Railway has repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army. At about 9:00 AM on the 22nd of last month, they buried mines and explosives on the railway at the Gongjiban Station of the Suiju Road and hid in ambush on both sides. When a Japanese train came from the east, the mine exploded immediately, and the train was overturned. The Chinese ambush troops saw that the train was destroyed and quickly launched an attack, throwing hand grenades into the train. All the Japanese soldiers in the train were killed. The Chinese troops completed their mission and returned to their defenses safely (October 10th dispatch).</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Attacking Shaanxi Damaged</p>
<p>Xi'an: When Japanese aircraft attacked Jingyang and other counties in Shaanxi on the 4th, two aircraft were damaged after being fiercely fired upon by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. In panic, the Japanese pilots dropped a machine gun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in the air above Yongledian in Jingyang County, and also dropped two machine guns near Gaoling. All of them were found by the local people and handed over to the county government. The machine gun found in Jingyang is a double-barreled Type 89, manufactured in February of Showa 15. The bullets and other items that have been transported to the province are now counted in full. It is said that the machine guns and explosives found in Gaoling will also be sent to the province (September 9th dispatch).</p>
<p>Japanese Transport Vehicles Hit Landmines</p>
<p>Chongqing Military News: Last month, the Japanese troops who had sneaked from Zhongfang Taolin Xitang to the Junchongtian area at the foot of the Dayun Mountains continued to sneak to the area north of Shenjiashan on the south side of the Dayun Mountains on the evening of the 5th, attempting to encircle and attack the Chinese Dayunshan Field Army. The Chinese troops took advantage of the terrain to lure the Japanese into the mountains, turning from Heqiao to the outer line, counter-encircling the Japanese. They launched an annihilation battle from midnight on the 8th, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers. Fierce fighting is still intensifying. A certain unit of the Chinese army in the triangular area of Southern Shanxi launched an attack on Yuecun along the river to Renjiazhuang, southwest of Ruicheng, at midnight on the 2nd, destroying several miles of Japanese communication equipment in the area, and buried landmines in the area east of Renjiazhuang.

<h3>Bumper Rice Harvest in Various Provinces This Year</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The rice harvest in various provinces this year is mostly better than last year. According to the Grain Production Increase Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the provinces with a 90% autumn harvest include Zhejiang and Yunnan, those with an 80% harvest include Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan, and Ningxia, those with a harvest of 70% to 80% include Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, those with a harvest of 60% to 70% include Guizhou and Guangxi, and those with a harvest of less than 60% include Gansu, Shaanxi, and Hubei. The total average harvest for 14 provinces is 70%, an increase of 0.9% compared to last year's average harvest, estimated to increase rice by approximately (××××× million) market dan. Except for Guizhou Province, whose harvest is the same as last year, and the autumn harvests of Gansu, Fujian, Guangxi, Hubei, and Shaanxi, which are slightly lower than last year, all other provinces are better than last year. Among them, the increased quantities of Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong are the highest. It is noted that last year's severe drought in the southwestern provinces had a significant impact on the autumn harvest, and except for 1927, it was one of the lowest yields in the past ten years. Sichuan Province's autumn harvest last year was 55%, a decrease of (××× million) market dan compared to the previous year. Zhejiang Province's harvest last year was 56%, a decrease of (××× million) market dan compared to the previous year. Guangdong Province's harvest last year was 70%, a decrease of (××× million) market dan compared to the previous year. This year's autumn harvest in these three provinces is estimated to increase Sichuan by more than 46 million market dan, Zhejiang by 23 million market dan, and Guangdong by more than 20.03 million market dan (October 10th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Tells American Reporter: China Determined to Fight to the End Until Worldwide Peace is Achieved</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 11th (Special dispatch from United Press correspondent Fei Shu) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek assured United Press reporters during a special interview yesterday that China will continue to resist Japan to the last person. Chairman Chiang also believes that as China continues to fight, the economic sanctions against Japan by the United States and other countries friendly to China will definitely be intensified, or at least not relaxed. Chairman Chiang stated, "This is a mutual understanding among the countries concerned in the Pacific to consistently implement a policy of resisting aggression." Chairman Chiang specially received the reporters in the afternoon, taking time out from his busy official duties at the wartime headquarters to explain the current situation in the Pacific. He said, "China has been resisting Japanese aggression for more than four years. Japan is a disturber of world peace, and it is now planning to develop its aggressive ambitions. However, Japan's combat power has been greatly weakened (Chairman Chiang smiled when he said this), and it is already at the end of its strength." When asked what he saw that led him to say this, he replied, "Japan's current situation is due to two major factors: one is China's resolute resistance, and the other is the economic sanctions against Japan led by the United States, such as freezing Japanese funds and prohibiting the export of military raw materials to Japan." When Chairman Chiang discussed the current Japanese-American talks, he said, "Japan's biggest goal in this move is obviously to try to make China stop resisting, or to resolve the so-called 'China Incident,' and to get the United States and other democratic countries to relax their economic sanctions against Japan." When asked if Japan had any hope of winning, Chairman Chiang said, "I can emphasize to our American friends that China will not change its policy of fighting to the end, and will make the necessary sacrifices again until a lasting and fair peace is truly achieved in the Far East and the world. At the same time, I hope and believe that while China continues to fight, the economic sanctions against Japan will be intensified, or at least not relaxed." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek warned those who are forgetful, saying, "Since the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, this government has adopted a national policy of making concessions on the one hand and openly threatening on the other. The Chinese government and the United States government have been repeatedly deceived by this kind of cunning trick in the past. I firmly believe that the governments of all friendly countries will show that they have learned a lesson from their painful experiences in dealing with Japan and will no longer be lured into a temporary illusion of security." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, dressed in military uniform and in high spirits, discussed the issues in a cordial manner, expressing a deep understanding of the situation in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>New Fujian Chairman Liu Jianxu Takes Office; Former Chairman Chen Yi Departs Fujian by Special Train; Liu and Chen Issue Separate Statements</h3>
<p>Yongan: The new Fujian Chairman Liu Jianxu arrived in Fujian on the 5th and held a handover ceremony with the former chairman on the morning of the 9th. (Dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Yongan: Former Chairman Chen Yi left Yongan by special train at 4 p.m. today. Two thousand people from various agencies, organizations, and schools saw him off. Chairman Liu also saw him off to Taoyuandong, 25 miles from the city, before returning to the city. (Dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Yongan: Former Fujian Provincial Government Chairman Chen Yi was internally transferred. During a farewell ceremony with personnel from central and local agencies here, he delivered a speech, stating briefly that he had been in charge of Fujian for seven and a half years. What he has strived for in his daily life is to promote the patriotic spirit of the entire people and continuously advocate the improvement of national morality, knowledge, physical fitness, so that every citizen knows that the country must fight for survival and development, and individuals should sacrifice everything to contribute to the country, because only in this way can the sacred goal of national rejuvenation be achieved. Now that he is leaving Fujian, he is still happy to hear news of Fujian's progress, hoping to popularize the national language and eliminate dialects, so as to eliminate local characteristics and feudal atmosphere, which is extremely important for national unity. (Dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>Yongan: After Chairman Liu took office on the 9th, the reporter made a special visit. Chairman Liu said that the current problem in Fujian Province is food. There is probably no need to worry. The province is a food-deficient province. In the future, the government should use various methods to control various materials, balance supply and demand, and strictly practice economy. At the same time, it should adjust the actual situation of obstruction, accurately investigate the amount of surplus and shortage, and open up sources of supplementary rice from outside the province. Secondly, regarding local public security, it should seek to improve the Baojia organization, complete county administration work, and strengthen the foundation of governance, so that within the province, no matter in poor rural areas, people can live and work in peace. Liu continued that he will use this to encourage the people of Fujian to complete provincial administration and mobilize the strength of the entire province to strive for victory in the war. He also said that the four million overseas Fujianese compatriots love their motherland and care about their hometown, and his words were extremely sincere. He hopes that they will continue to maintain it in the future. (Dispatch from the 9th)</p>

<h3>Full Text of British Prime Minister's Speech (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>No Ambition for Syria; Striving for Independence</p>
<p>The German conspiracy to collude with the Vichy French in Syria was also actively underway, and the Governor of Syria, Dentz, was doing his best to promote the German side's interests in a despicable and treacherous manner. At that time, we were under pressure, our army had withdrawn from Greece, and lost a large number of outposts, and was invaded by the German army in Africa, and we also had to deal with the rebellion in Iraq. However, we were finally able to join the Free French Army in entering Syria. The Free French Army fought bravely, and the British Army, about four divisions, including Australian and Indian troops, repeatedly achieved victories. The British occupation of Syria ensured the safety of Cyprus, stabilized part of the Near East, and made the control of the eastern end of the Mediterranean by our navy and air force more efficient, and we were also able to make direct contact with our Turkish friends and control the oil pipeline and other resources. We have no ambition in Syria, neither wanting to replace France in any part of Syria, nor wanting to seize French interests. We only entered Syria in order to win the war. However, I must state that the Free French have agreed to our policy, which is to hand Syria over to the Syrians, who will regain their independence and sovereignty at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>Axis Difficult to Cross the Line; Dreams of Invading Egypt Shattered</p>
<p>At the same time, the eastern wing of my Nile River army has inflicted two major blows on the German-Italian army that is trying to retake Cyrenaica. The enemy army has realized that it cannot attack Egypt, because it has failed to capture the She Bai Lu Ke pass, which is firmly defended by the British-Australian army. Our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Xisha Han in May and June. Although it failed to drive back the enemy army, it has stopped the enemy army from advancing. The German's wild claim that they could reach the Suez Canal by the end of May has proved to be worthless. Fresh troops from our side have arrived at the front line of the Nile River one after another. I believe that we will definitely be able to defend Egypt and prevent the enemy army from crossing the Western Desert. The unfortunate setback that our side suffered in early April after defeating the Italian army has now been eliminated. We can truly be satisfied with this satisfactory development.</p>
<p>Commending the Red Army's Resistance; Effective Assistance Will Be Given</p>
<p>Turning to a larger range of battles, the Soviet army's strong resistance and its amazing way of retreating from the vast front line have indeed shattered Hitler's hopes of a quick victory over the Soviet Union. Three months after the start of the German-Soviet war, Hitler shed more Germanic blood than was spilled on the battlefield in any year of the last World War. In the future, he will have to maintain an army stationed on the entire front line from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, on an extremely long and dangerous transportation line, when the severe cold rages in the north and the Soviet army launches fierce counterattacks. Since the day Germany invaded the Soviet Union, we have devoted all our efforts to providing our new comrade country with the most rapid and effective assistance. I do not want to discuss the military plans we have already studied to cause hindrance, nor can I debate this issue. All I can say is that in terms of supply, I agree with President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin. This need is extremely urgent and the scope is extremely large. Now a large part of the Soviet Union's munitions and steel production has fallen into the hands of the Germans, and the Soviet Union must also equip an army of 10 million to 15 million soldiers.</p>
<p>The Opening of the Three-Nation Conference in Moscow is Not Far Away</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet-British-American conference will work on how to enable the Soviet Union to continue to resist and how to adjust the supply. In arranging this conference or selecting the attendees, some delays are inevitable, or some may say that nothing has been done. In fact, the discussion of the entire issue has never stopped on the British and American sides. We are now waiting for the arrival of the American delegation. I expect the American mission to arrive soon. The British representative is led by Beaverbrook, who will have very close talks with President Roosevelt. The people traveling with Beaverbrook have already been selected, and their names will be announced when the time is appropriate. As for the departure date, it is not convenient to disclose, but it must not be far away. At present, many very important and urgent decisions are being made, and a large number of supplies are already on their way. In terms of munitions, we must be prepared to make major sacrifices to meet the needs of the Soviet Union. (The crowd cheers. Anyone related to production must make great efforts, not only to aid the Soviet Union, but also to fill the gaps in our urgently needed supplies. Everything given to the Soviet Union is taken from what we make ourselves, or taken from the American military supplies originally intended to be delivered to Britain. The production of Britain and the British Empire is now increasing steadily. In the third year of the war, munitions production can reach its full height. If the United States fulfills its self-determined work, then very large factories must still be established or transformed, and the consumption of the American people must also be reduced. The supply of American military supplies that we relied on before may be temporarily or will be reduced, but within a certain limit, we are fully prepared to accept this fact.</p>
<p>Opening Up the Iranian Route Facilitates the Transport of Soviet War Equipment</p>
<p>We are clearly faced with other limiting factors, such as time, distance, and local conditions. The convenience of transportation and seaports has its limits, especially shipping. There are only three routes open to enter the Soviet Union. One is the Arctic Ocean route through Archangel. This route may be blocked by winter ice. The second is the Far East route through Vladivostok, which is envied by the Japanese. Its railway line is more than 7,000 miles long. The third is the route across Persia, which extends 500 miles from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea. The Caspian Sea has a strong Soviet navy and can directly reach the Volga region in the center of the Soviet Union. Of the above three routes, the Persian route is the shortest. The Germans, of course, use their old tricks to operate in Persia. Therefore, German tourist groups, missions, and diplomats confuse the Persian government and the public in order to create a fifth column, so as to control the Tehran government and close our most stable and shortest route to the Soviet Union. It is not only to seize or destroy oil fields. We therefore believe that it is necessary to stop this activity and prevent it from succeeding. We have asked the Persian government to immediately expel the Teutons. We must put all the local Germans and Italians under our control. (The crowd cheers.) And we must make the German and Italian embassies withdraw from Persia. As for their diplomatic status, we will of course respect them. We must have the undisputed right to manage and maintain the transportation from the warm-water port of Basra to the Caspian Sea. (The crowd cheers.) So that British and American supplies can be continuously transported to the center of the Soviet Union from here. We will make various efforts to improve railway transportation and expand the number of supplies that can be transported on the current British-gauge railway. Fortunately, this railway has just been completed recently and only requires a large number of vehicles and locomotives to expand this supply line. I think the House will approve of the rigorous plan that we have had to adopt to achieve this essential goal. (The crowd cheers.) The occupation of Persia can enable our troops to join hands with the southern wing of the Soviet army and carry out land and air force operations, and can enable us to achieve the goal of preventing the German advance to the east. At this time, the meritorious Indian army can take on a greater task and keep the war away from the homes of Indians thousands of miles away. Therefore, we must expect that our British-Indian army, as well as Australian or other Dominion armies, will gradually expand their power in this vast, barren, and undeveloped area. Now the allied army's line forms a semicircle, starting from Spitsbergen Island in the Arctic Ocean to Tobruk in the Western Desert.</p>
<p>The Status of Britain Has Changed; Ensuring Maritime Security</p>
<p>I can happily say that the ample naval strength now available in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans can prevent the sea lanes from being attacked. If we look back on the past, we will definitely feel that our position in the Near East or the East has indeed improved significantly, which cannot be compared with the situation when France suddenly withdrew from the war and Italy launched a fierce attack on us. Because at that time, the number of troops we were stationed in various parts of the Near East was small and the equipment was extremely lacking. All of the best of them had been sent to the French front. We also lost the tool of safe transportation through the Mediterranean Sea, and the main base we relied on, and the defenses of various places in Africa and the Nile River basin and Palestine, such as Cairo and Jerusalem, also made us feel worried all the time. At that time, there was no safe place. But after a year, the situation has changed. We have formed a large army of 750,000 men and have obtained various equipment. Our air force has been greatly developed and is rapidly expanding. We have conquered Italy's entire empire in Africa and killed and captured more than 400,000 Italian troops. We have consolidated the border defenses of Egypt to prevent attacks from the German-Italian army. We have strengthened our position in Palestine and Iraq. We have control of Syria and given safety to Cyprus. With swift and powerful action, we have joined forces with the Soviet army in Persia and are on the route to prevent the enemy from advancing eastward. No matter what happens in the future, this achievement will definitely be admired by history. Britain's needs do not allow for any form of prior exaggeration. This is not the time to boast. But a year ago, our situation was very dark. This is a fact. Today, we might as well tell people that we are still the masters of our own destiny and the guardians of our own souls.</p>
<p>Members Unanimously Express Support for the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration</p>
<p>During the British Prime Minister's speech, the ambassadors of China, the Soviet Union, and Spain, as well as the high commissioners of South Africa, Australia, and Canada to the UK, were in the audience. The British Prime Minister reviewed the war situation and presented the facts without paying attention to rhetoric. Labour Party opposition member Lees-Smith said that he felt that the current situation in Britain was indeed more satisfactory than it was a year ago. There were four major turning points in the war: one was the fall of France, the second was the Battle of Britain, the third was the American Lend-Lease Act, and the fourth was the Soviet Union's magical resistance, which surprised not only the German command but also the world's general staffs. He very much hoped that the British-American eight-point declaration would be implemented as soon as possible. If land forces had to be sent to the European continent, he hoped that there would be adequate preparations to attack rather than always take the defensive. Egypt was a country suitable for winter warfare. Hitler's great effort to transport supplies across the Mediterranean showed that Hitler also knew that Egypt was suitable for winter warfare. Liberal Party leader Harris agreed on the necessity of doing his best to aid the Soviet Union and said that the eight-point declaration was the Atlantic Charter signed by the two great modern men, and it was the foundation on which we built. He very much hoped that both the British and American Congresses would ratify this Charter, and then it would be passed by the Allied governments. Lord Privy Seal Attlee opposed the criticism of this Atlantic Charter, saying that the statements made by the leaders of the two great powers, Britain and the United States, could only involve general principles. At present, it is impossible to talk about the detailed procedures to be applied to the future world. The British government and its people have decided to do everything they can to help the Allies. Communist Party member Gallagher interjected, "Does everyone in the government think so?" Attlee replied, "Yes, everyone thinks so. Everything that can be done will be done. We will give the Soviet Union what we can give, but it must be known that this must be taken from production, and our production is not enough to meet our needs. We are prepared to sacrifice and prepare to increase production." (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Yarn Merchants Conserve Energy; Listen to Roosevelt's Speech and Decide the Outcome Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market has re-entered a state of dormancy. This is because most people are bearish, so the amount of short selling has increased significantly. The concept of short sellers is that the international situation may change, and they are all conserving energy, waiting for the President's speech to be announced today before deciding the outcome again. Therefore, the market is very dull and weak. As for the amount absorbed by large households, they also do not give up. It is conceivable that the struggle between the two sides is fierce. I don't know who will win. However, the current yarn Hong Kong gangs are purchasing very little. Some people also say that the transactions directly negotiated by foreign firms in Southeast Asia are quite active, but there is a shortage of ships and they cannot be loaded in time. The high price of 20-count Shuangma is 1,747 yuan, and the low price is 1,738 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon is 1,743 yuan, rising to 1,746 yuan, and the closing price is 1,740 yuan. At present, the yarn market cannot relax when thinking about itself. However, rumors are rife, which makes people even more divided.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning. Following yesterday's good popularity, the opening price was 1,745 yuan. After a while, it rose to 1,747 yuan. Later, it was heard that there were not many spot yarn transactions, and the shorts became active again. As for the opening of the exchange, it was soft and tired, and the market fell again to 1,738 yuan. However, foreign firms in Southeast Asia are purchasing, and there are transactions every day, and the selling price is very high, and people's hearts are revitalized. Large households bought in on the dip, and it rose again to 1,747 yuan. By the time of closing, it had eased back a step, and the price was 1,743 yuan. According to statistics, 9,100 bales were traded in half a day, all of which were traded by peers.</p>
<p>In the futures market for Golden Shuangma, the trend was winding in a dull atmosphere, and the market turned clear and idle. Because American cotton was tired and the news between countries was still expected to unfold, the exchange went up and down suddenly, making people uneasy and unable to rely on each other. Therefore, the large households, whose longs were in this mid-range market, had little intention of entering for a while, and the shorts were also concerned about changes in the environment, and there was even less activity, resulting in a lonely market, leading to a brewing trend. Therefore, the ups and downs were narrow, and the high and low prices of near and far periods only differed by seven or eight yuan. In the morning, the September period opened at 1,649 yuan, the October period at 1,660 yuan, and the November period at 1,677 yuan. In the middle of the journey, because the factory orders were tired, many floaters sold out, so the recent period once fell to 1,646 yuan, the October period fell to 1,657 yuan, and the November period fell to 1,673 yuan. By the time of the afternoon closing, it rebounded slightly. In the afternoon, it hovered, still tired after the initial settlement. The potential of buyers could not be strengthened, so it was taken advantage of by scattered shorts, so near the closing, the November period once again fell to 1,673 yuan, and it showed weakness. As a result, the September period was 1,649 yuan and 50 cents. Because it did not rise from yesterday, it was good by 5 yuan and 50 cents. The October period was 1,658 yuan and 50 cents, down 1 yuan and 50 cents. The November period was 674 yuan and 50 cents, also down 6 yuan and 50 cents. The opening and closing prices and high and low prices are listed on the left (net disk bid price).</p>
<h3>Autumn Rain and Autumn Wind Sadden the Cotton</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation: coarse velvet is sought-after and the selling price is rising day by day. This is because the stock is becoming thinner, and secondly, the source is difficult. In addition, the domestic climate is humid, and the autumn wind and autumn rain are raging endlessly. The new cotton production has been greatly damaged. The future cotton market is unpredictable. At the same time, the need for fabrics in Southeast Asia is becoming more prosperous, and 23-count yarn is needed for spinning.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market plummeted due to the influence of the Washington news, the Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau, requested the release of government cotton and wheat, the public settled, and the Southern gangs' arbitrage was quite active. Although there was a slight rise in the middle due to short covering, it fell again later due to the weakness of New Orleans. As a result, the closing price fell by about 43-44 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is closed. It is predicted that the market will open about five rupees lower than yesterday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai cotton trade has turned flat again. This is probably due to the decline in American cotton and the influence of the public taking a wait-and-see attitude. There have not been many transactions in recent days. Yesterday, only Brazilian cotton had a small purchase intention, and the rest was slightly sluggish.</p>
<h3>Three Essential Elements for Calculating Yarn Costs: Machinery, Raw Materials, and Labor are Indispensable; 20-count Yarn Costs Approximately 1,600 Yuan</h3>
<p>A former colleague, Mr. Someone, manager of a certain yarn company, upon seeing the yarn and cotton reports in the commercial news section of this newspaper, which mentioned the raw material price for spinning 20-count yarn as 350 to 380 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), with 3.5 dan of cotton needed per bale of yarn, plus miscellaneous opening and handling fees of 250 to 300 yuan, resulting in a factory cost of somewhere between 1,800 and 1,900 yuan (?), believed it was incorrect. He requested the author to rewrite a draft to provide a more accurate report to avoid misleading the public.</p>
<p>When discussing the current cost of 20-count cotton yarn, price factors are interconnected in many ways. First, the quality of the machinery (production tool) directly affects the production rate (high or low), thus indirectly impacting costs. For example, in the same yarn mill, both possessing 10,000 spindles, one uses new machinery (of recent age), and the other uses old machinery (of long age). The final production rates will differ significantly. New machines can produce 1.25 to 1.5 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per day and night, whereas old machines produce less than one pound, approximately 0.95 pounds. Thus, with the same 10,000 spindles, new machines can produce 12,000 to 15,000 pounds per day and night, while old machines produce only about 9,500 pounds, a difference of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds (the yarn production also differs by about ten bales), which can affect the cost. Second, the quality of cotton used matters. Using cotton with better fibers increases the cost, but it is actually cheaper than using cotton with poor fibers because less cotton is used and less waste is produced. Conversely, using more inferior cotton with more waste will increase costs. Third, personnel management is important. If workshop workers and staff can consciously conserve resources and save materials, the cost of each bale of yarn will be reduced significantly. Conversely, if workers and staff are careless, fail to conserve resources, and allow workers to waste materials, the cost will inevitably increase. Therefore, machinery, raw materials, and labor are the biggest factors affecting the cost of cotton yarn. Some require 355 jin (or even 360 jin) of cotton per bale, while others require only 346 to 347 jin, generally about 350 jin. Indian cotton (such as Amraoti and Panganga) accounts for 80%, and local cotton (such as Huo Ji) accounts for 20%. Indian cotton costs about 400 yuan per dan, and Huo Ji cotton costs about 300 yuan per dan. The combined average cotton cost is 380 yuan per dan. Using 350 jin of cotton, the total cotton cost is 1,330 yuan, plus opening and handling fees (including manufacturing costs, management fees, financial expenses, etc.) of 300 yuan (e.g., wages: 120 yuan, electricity: 70 yuan, materials: 60 yuan, interest, miscellaneous expenses, insurance, etc.: approximately 50 yuan). Thus, the total cost of one bale of 20-count cotton yarn is 1,630 yuan (even with some differences, it will not exceed 1,700 yuan). The market price is about 1,750 yuan, leaving the factory with a net profit of over 100 yuan per bale. Speculators can take this into consideration. (Long Ju)</p>
<p>Grain: August Survey; 400,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai; Yesterday's Rice Prices First Weakened, Then Strengthened</p>
<p>The import of foreign rice is reported daily in this newspaper, with monthly summaries published. Last month (August), a total of 400,456 bags of foreign rice arrived, including 200,717 bags from Hong Kong, 65,529 bags directly from Siam, 67,500 bags directly from Saigon, 30,000 bags directly from Rangoon, and 34,000 bags from the Dutch East Indies (Java). The Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-price foreign rice is also included in the above total.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a fluctuating situation. The market opened in the morning carrying over the previous day's weakness. The atmosphere in the market was very peaceful. Not only did new bulls dare not take risks, but even those with goods in hand sought to sell them off. The market then declined sharply, continuing to fall. Small-package rice fell from 106 yuan to 104 yuan, and foreign warehouses even fell to 103 yuan, one or two yuan lower than the previous afternoon's low price. However, after the price fell, sellers were unwilling to sell at such low prices. Moreover, because the Municipal Council's selling price was still 117 yuan, 13 to 14 yuan higher than the market price, and although new contracts were available, the prices were slightly higher, speculative groups actively took advantage of the low prices to buy in. The market then recovered from its weakness. Small-package spot goods rose again to 106 to 107 yuan. Yinghua Silu goods once fell to 132 yuan. Spot goods in the general market, both original packages at 127 yuan and 129 yuan, were all lower than the previous opening by 1.5 to 3 or 4 yuan. Then the market sellers held firm, and prices were shouted higher again. Throughout the day, transactions ended with local speculators and hoarders hesitant to buy in large quantities due to rumors of peace. Transactions in spot goods were less than 10,000 bags, and only 300 to 400 tons of Yinghua Si.</p>
<p>The thick and thin japonica domestic rice market continued to see sluggish sales, making it difficult for holders to support prices. It followed foreign rice, dropping lower. Early japonica rice from Kainangang opened at 149 yuan and 147 yuan. Special japonica rice from Wuxi was at 151 yuan. As for new japonica rice from Pudong, due to cloudy and rainy weather, the arrival of goods was scarce, and holders were more willing to hold onto their stock, priced at 151 yuan to 150 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous depreciation of other goods, people's minds were affected for glutinous rice, and both wholesale and retail appetite turned weak. Although market goods were scarce, market prices were difficult to maintain, falling by one or two yuan. Special white glutinous rice from Cha Fei opened at 126 to 127 yuan, with general market prices ranging from a high of 125 yuan plus a half to a low of 121 yuan. Glutinous green beans were at 111 to 112 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Also Lack Vigor</h3>
<p>In the atmosphere of strong peace rumors, the situation for foreign flour had been weakening and lifeless. Moreover, yesterday's report stated that flour had been included in the foreign exchange regulations for imported goods, enough to break the recent rumors that flour was not subject to foreign exchange restrictions. New hoarders refrained from action, and those with goods in hand were fearful and eager to sell, so the market became even weaker. Paohe opened at only 32 yuan and 1 jiao, and Golden Dragon also fell from 30 yuan and 7 jiao to 30 yuan and 5 jiao. Prices all saw a drop of two or three jiao. However, new contracts have not been agreed upon for a long time. Only a little over 100,000 bags were contracted in the middle of last month. Since the beginning of the month, foreign wheat merchants have been short-selling 3,000 tons of wheat to the factories. To this day, both deliveries are lacking, and Chinese factories have no durum wheat to supply, making it difficult to continue. Therefore, local flour has consistently stood at 34 yuan. Large wholesalers and hoarders are unwilling to sell, and flour prices have gradually rebounded as local speculators and new hoarders take advantage of the low prices to absorb supply. Paohe reached 32 yuan and 4 jiao, while Golden Dragon at foreign warehouses rose slightly to 30 yuan and 8 jiao. Nearly 20,000 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soap Factories Procure Raw Oil; Oil Prices Rebound After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market situation initially fell and then rose. At first, influenced by the rumors of the previous day, people's minds were still not invigorated, and prices once again saw a drop of one or two yuan. Later, due to short sellers buying in at low prices and large customers from the yarn and cotton industry suddenly absorbing large quantities, the market situation changed from weak to firm, and prices rose across the board. As a result, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil rose by three to four yuan compared to the previous day. Statistics show that over 8,000 dans of clear oil from the Dayou Factory were sold for delivery in late September, with an opening price of 164 yuan and 5 jiao, a low of 161 yuan, and a closing and high of 168 yuan. Also, over 5,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory had an opening price of 161 yuan and 5 jiao, a low of 160 yuan, and a high of 169 yuan, closing at 167 yuan. Additionally, local streets and soap factories procured 240 barrels of raw oil from Qingdao at a price of 170 yuan, and 500 cans of raw oil from Yantai at a price of 256 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, on the 11th, 470 bags of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, and 300 pieces of raw oil arrived from Qingdao.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Over 90,000 Bags Arrive in Ten Days; Sugar Prices Decline</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai sugar market has been horizontal and difficult to rise, but the arrival of foreign sugar in Shanghai, as surveyed by this newspaper, is more prosperous than before. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship brought a large batch of granulated sugar from Hong Kong, totaling 11,709 bags, which were unloaded at the company's wharf in Pudong. According to the local association, the amount of foreign sugar arriving this month has already reached 93,975 bags, which is not a small amount, but sugar merchants continue to manipulate it. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was initially loose, then tightened again. The company's futures for coarse white sugar for the 20th of the month were at 137 yuan and 5 jiao, gradually falling to 29 yuan and 3 jiao, then recovering to 31 yuan and 2 jiao, and in the afternoon, 31 yuan and 5 jiao, 32 yuan and 9 jiao, 8 jiao, and 6 jiao. For the 30th of the month, from 131 yuan and 6 jiao to 30 yuan and 6 jiao, it rebounded to 33 yuan and 3 jiao, and in the afternoon, 31 yuan and 7 jiao, 34 yuan and 2 jiao, 6 jiao, and 8 jiao. Spot market prices for August imports were at 132 yuan to 4 jiao, and in the afternoon, 33 yuan and 6 jiao. July was at 31 yuan and 7 jiao to 32 yuan, and in the afternoon, 33 yuan. June was at 131 yuan and 3 jiao, and in the afternoon, 33 yuan. May was at 30 yuan and 5 jiao, and in the afternoon, 32 yuan. Taikoo Car White B mark was at 160 yuan, later 5 jiao, and HX mark was at 142 yuan, all down by 1 yuan and 5 jiao. Car Red, due to small inventory and actual sales needs, H mark was at 118 yuan, uniquely up by 1 yuan. Dutch Red consignment goods were at 121 yuan, and spot goods at 22 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 45,000 bags in futures and over 5,000 bags in spot goods.</p>
<h3>Finance: Spot Gold Drops Another 100 Yuan; Futures May Change Course and Seek New Development</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's last month's futures gold had rumors of seeking new development. It is said that since the black market may disappear and foreign exchange is pegged, the gold futures trading has lost its tool for speculation. What is lacking is a method of settlement. Originally, the gold auction settlement used British gold and Japanese gold, and then all used US dollars, which has been the practice for a long time. However, those who trade futures are not pegged to the US dollar and remain silent. There is a large territory within reach of today's occupied areas and the influence of the Japanese yen. Therefore, there are rumors that its ticket value may be used for settlement in Japanese yen. However, Japanese currency is not comparable to the Japanese gold of the past. Fortunately, today's futures gold market is not comparable to the old gold auction. It is said that yesterday's futures transactions were over 1,000 taels, mostly to close out trades. Supply exceeded demand, and the price had retreated to the 6,850 yuan level, and then dropped another 17 yuan. Spot gold is still falling amidst demand from various banks, having retreated within 8,900 yuan. In the morning, Tianyuan Jinde paid 200 taels and Decheng Jinxiang paid 50 taels at 9,000 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Soon, it fell sharply. Zhongxing Decheng each sold 50 taels, Hesheng sold 60 taels, and Yongcheng Mingfeng each sold 20 taels, all bought by Chengyi. Yifeng sold 51 taels to Tianyuan, and Hesheng sold 10 taels to Xianghe. The price had retreated to 8,950 yuan. Chengda paid 20 taels to Decheng, and Xianghe paid 30 taels to Yifeng, rising to 8,970 yuan. Xiangxing Yong sold 20 taels to Chengyi, falling to 8,950 yuan. Xinfeng Yong paid 20 taels to Decheng Yifeng each, raising it to 8,970 yuan. Decheng sold 30 taels to Tianyuan, and Defu sold 10 taels to Hengji for 8,960 yuan. At noon, the selling pressure turned strong, and the decline was even sharper. Defu sold 50 taels and Xianghe sold 10 taels, both bought by Tianyuan. Lianxing sold 20 taels of De characters, and Mingfeng sold 10 taels of Xinfeng Yong, and Chengyi sold 20 taels of Hesheng, already falling to 8,900 yuan. Later, there was even more supply than demand. The initial opening in the afternoon was 70 yuan lower. Wanfeng Decheng each sold 10 taels to Chengyi, and Yongfeng sold 10 taels each to Chida Gongda, all for 8,830 yuan. Litai suddenly paid 20 taels to Yutai Feng and 10 taels to Yongcheng, all for 8,880 yuan, and then paid another 50 taels to Yifeng and 20 taels to Xianghe. Xianghe then paid another 30 taels each to Yifeng and Decheng, all for 8,890 yuan. Finally, Chengyi sold 20 taels to Litai for 8,880 yuan, 100 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 170 yuan in high and low. The selling price of gold coins from Jinhao was 8,950 yuan, with a reduction of 200 yuan for buying back. Jewelry gold was also reduced by 10 yuan, totaling 910 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Prices Fall Step by Step</p>
<p>The October futures for each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:15 AM. Jufeng Yong sold 50 taels to Tianyuan at a price of 6,870 yuan. Xianghe Yifeng tried to sell forcefully, shouting over 6,875 yuan, but no deal was made. Later, it fell to 6,862 yuan, and Xinfeng Yong bought in. It was stable at noon, and the market closed at 6,865 yuan. The afternoon opening at 2 PM was 6,865 yuan. Dafeng sold 100 taels to Xinfeng Yong for 6,860 yuan. Later, at 3:25 PM, Deda Chida suddenly sold, and it fell another 7 yuan, closing at 6,853 yuan, 17 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 17 yuan in high and low.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Drops Another Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was reduced by ten yuan at 11:30 AM, to 910 yuan, with a reduction of 50 yuan for buying back, it is said.</p>
<h3>Black Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the central bank and HSBC post the same rates. HSBC's small price for British gold was 3 pence 15625, and US dollars was 5 yuan 3125. Normal commercial settlements saw no applications throughout the day. It is said that most import and export foreign firms will still have to entrust brokers to buy and sell on their behalf. The bull and bear US dollar rates in the black market still cannot be aligned with the market prices agreed upon by both the banks. The Stabilization Fund has not given any instructions, and it may deliver on expiry and sell to importers of general non-essential goods. The market price is still about 2 pence 859375 for British gold and 4 yuan 84375 for US dollars. It is heard that a certain Chinese merchant in this city has a deposit of 50,000 US dollars in the United States, priced at 5 yuan 375 and 34375, allocated to the Central Bank as a national currency deposit account.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 11th (Thursday) - This morning, the exchange market opened with unusual stability. The spot rate for the Central Bank opened at 465 yuan, the spot rate for the Japanese exchange has not been opened yet, and there were no gains or losses for the rest.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 11th (Thursday) - This morning, the exchange market opened steadily. The London telegraphic transfer was tightened by 125, to 3 pence 125. The New York telegraphic transfer was reduced by 25, to 5 yuan 125. The Central Bank exchange rate was lowered by 2 yuan and 5 jiao, to 90 yuan and 5 jiao. The "United Currency" dark market returned cheaply by 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, to 5 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Rise More Sharply; Domestic Debt Rebounds Slightly</h3>
<p>The OTC market for public bonds rebounded slightly yesterday after several days of continuous gains. All bonds rebounded by about six or seven jiao. The market saw floating longs exiting to take profits, while large bull positions remained unmoved. The market has reached its peak, and a small number of jiao were a matter of course. The overall trend still needs to be shifted depending on the environmental situation. At present, it may be a few more jiao, but in the end there is no large or small side. It is not easy for C-type to break the one-yuan barrier. In the morning, Jiucheng Hao absorbed quite a bit, so C-type still opened outside of two yuan. Later, Zhongfu Runde Tiansheng Yongchang sold out, although Lianhe Dazhong Runli still had some interest, but the selling pressure was still heavy, and it was pressed down by two or three jiao. The noon closing was two, three, and four jiao lower. Trading was quiet in the afternoon. Yongchang bought back a little, and Tongshun added a little more. Jiucheng, which had entered in the morning, reappeared in the afternoon. Lianyi Hongda also exited, and the market fell another two or three jiao in the afternoon. As a result, they all eased back by five and a half to seven jiao. The transaction volume was estimated to be about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Zhongnan Bank were traded at a price of 140 yuan.</p>
<p>The rise in the public utility stock market has intensified, people's minds have always been good, and sellers' chips are clearly lacking, so many kinds continue to create new highs. In the industrial stock market, Yihua Steel Industry, Ken Zhi and the shares of various silver companies are particularly strong among buyers. In the rubber stock market, British Chazha, British Yinda District Rubber Trust and Rubber and other varieties are the most popular.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East company stocks remained stable. Only the shares of McCallig Bank rose by one shilling and three pence, with a price of nine pounds, six shillings, and three pence. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Evolution of Check Clearing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee has decided to change the check clearing system starting on the 15th of this month. This process is quite memorable. Before January 1933, the clearing of checks between Chinese commercial banks in this city was done by drawing notes and entrusting them to money shops for clearing. Since the establishment of the Japanese Bank Check Clearing House in January 1933, checks between commercial banks have been directly exchanged and cleared. At that time, a total of 32 banks joined the exchange. The business of the clearing house has become increasingly developed. As of recently, a total of 37 banks have joined the exchange, as well as more than 70 branches, 14 entrusted agent exchange banks, and more than 100 banks that have opened transactions with the clearing house and entrusted it to collect checks. At present, most of the receipts and payments for the entire year's check funds have been concentrated in the clearing house. Recently, due to factual needs and to unify procedures, the clearing house has uniformly changed the check clearing system to a collection method. On the clearing house's side, the handling procedures can be unified. On the side of each exchange bank, there is no need to send exchange staff to the clearing house every day to handle check exchange matters. As for the money industry, the inter-industry check clearing has been using a public order system for a year. Due to the trend of the times, it has been changed to a "difference report form" system since June of this year. The method is that Bank A receives a check submitted by a customer payable to Bank B. Bank A uses an "Interbank Receipt Notice" to specify the number of checks and the amount, and together with the checks, sends a staff member to Bank B. After Bank B counts and confirms that there are no errors, they give the original staff member back a "Interbank Receipt Receipt". After the checks are mutually collected among the banks on the same day, each bank fills in a "Difference Report Form" stating the amount it received today, the amount it paid today, and the words "net receipt today" or "net payment today", and reports to the money treasury, and transfers the funds to the money treasury based on the document. Therefore, check clearing matters, banks are concentrated in the check clearing house, and money shops are concentrated in the money treasury. Now that both industries are implementing improved check clearing matters due to the needs of their businesses, the development of the two industries can be expected. (Ying Yongyu)</p>

<h3>Hawkins and McKay Convene Financial Conference Yesterday; 14 Allied Banks Attended; Discuss Implementation of Foreign Exchange Supply Measures; Shanghai Market Prices Expected to Turn Around After Supply of Foreign Exchange for Necessities</h3>
<p>After the General Manager of McCallig Bank, Hawkins, and the Supervisor of the Hua Tu Bank, McKay, returned to Shanghai on the President Cleveland, sources responsible for the matter revealed that the two would hold a meeting with senior officials of 14 banks in the city to make an important decision on the foreign exchange problem in Shanghai. Although Hawkins and McKay did not meet with the American member Fox in Hong Kong, they had lengthy discussions with other members while in Hong Kong. Therefore, the problems discussed at the Shanghai banking community meeting convened after their return to Shanghai were mostly about the implementation of the new measures. The purpose was to determine the relationship between the 14 banks and their clients, as well as the relationship between Chinese commercial banks. According to information received as of press time, this meeting was held at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired with a senior official of McCallig Bank about whether there were any new developments after Mr. Hawkins returned to Shanghai. It was said that in addition to the announced trial measures for September and the two lists of permitted import items, there were no other changes. However, it was revealed that foreign banks are determined to cooperate effectively with the Equalization Fund, and will never buy or sell black market exchange rates thereafter.</p>
<p>The Four Banks Started Handling Foreign Exchange Business Yesterday</p>
<p>According to reliable information obtained by a Da Zhong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai branches of the four banks, including Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, have started handling the foreign exchange business specially approved by the Equalization Fund, just like foreign banks, since receiving the order. Therefore, the situation in the foreign exchange sector of each bank was very busy yesterday morning. The specific foreign exchange supply measures and application forms were issued at the same time as the official order. The documents received included the trial measures for the specially approved foreign exchange banks in September, and a copy of the two lists of permitted import items, as well as two types of printed English forms: one is an application form to the Equalization Fund for the supply of foreign exchange, and the other is a letter from the bank to the Equalization Fund. As to when the four banks will start handling foreign exchange application business for other Chinese commercial banks, the order did not involve it. It is said that "There is indeed a resolution for the four banks to handle foreign exchange application business for other Chinese commercial banks, but it has not yet been finalized. As it stands, it can be implemented. This is purely an obligation on the part of the four banks, and the commission should be returned to the Chinese commercial bank entrusting the handling."</p>
<h3>Slightly Corrected Application Items</h3>
<p>Regarding the application procedures, the original prepared forms were in triplicate. It is understood that an additional copy must be added in the future, making it quadruplicate. The triplicate is submitted to the Equalization Fund, and one copy is kept by the applicant bank. The name of the application form and items 3, 4, 5, and 9 of the old ten items have been slightly corrected. The name of the old form was "Application Form for Purchasing Foreign Exchange from the Equalization Fund," and it has now been corrected to "Application Form for Requesting Supply of Foreign Exchange from the Equalization Fund." Item 3, "Total Amount of Foreign Exchange Sold," has been corrected to "Total Amount of Foreign Exchange Requested." Item 4, "Date and Type of Foreign Exchange Sold to Importers," has been corrected to "Type of Foreign Exchange Requested by Importers." Item 5, "Type B," has been corrected to "Type B and Quantity." Item 9, "Remarks," has been added with "Approximate Date of Shipment."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Prices Expected to Turn Around</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from New Voice News Agency inquired with informed sources on their opinions on the issue of Shanghai market prices. The conclusions obtained were extremely consistent and concrete, believing that the prospects for Shanghai market prices are promising. Since the Equalization Fund Committee instructed the designated banks in Shanghai to handle the supply of foreign exchange for necessities, market prices have tended to decline. There are five direct and indirect reasons: (1) Chinese legal tender has a more solid foundation and a stronger value due to the support of friendly countries such as Britain and the United States, and the exchange rate set by the Equalization Fund increases the purchasing power of legal tender, causing market prices to fall. (2) The scope of the foreign exchange supply items determined by the Equalization Fund Committee is broad, allowing importers to obtain foreign exchange at favorable prices. Therefore, the prices of all items approved for foreign exchange settlement can be lower than before, especially for essential items such as rice, kerosene, coal, food, raw materials, sugar, wheat, grain products, and flour, which can be settled at low exchange rates. This is the main reason for the decline in market prices. (3) The Municipal Council's port rice will hardly rise in the future, at least enough to prevent other market prices from continuing to rise, and the authorities of the two concessions have recently resolved to crack down on illegal price increases, so speculative merchants have to worry. (4) The convenience of ship transportation has gradually improved recently, and foreign traffic has also become slightly smoother, so that freight transportation is not interrupted, which has a great impact on suppressing market prices. (5) The situation in Shanghai is no longer as tense as it was in the middle and lower sentences of last month, people's minds are becoming more stable, the trend of purchasing a large number of goods in advance has stopped, and merchants have no opportunity to take advantage of, so market prices may fall back.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Discusses Internal Transfer of Floating Capital</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 10th, the Executive Yuan is currently inviting experts to study what subtle ways to transfer the floating capital in Shanghai internally. However, there are no reliable statistics on the exact amount of this floating capital. However, according to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun published the day before yesterday, the total deposits of banks in this city at the end of 1936, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, totaled 150 billion yuan in Chinese currency. By the end of last year, it had increased to 285 billion yuan in Chinese currency, resulting in a phenomenon where banks do not pay interest on deposits but instead charge handling fees.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intends to Implement Price Limits on Coal Balls</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council will form a new committee within a few days to set the price of coal balls in the Public Concession. The committee may have seven members, who will first study the situation of coal balls and then make recommendations to the Bureau on setting the price of coal balls. The establishment of this committee is in response to the request of coal companies, applying for the Bureau to assist in solving the problem of coal ball prices here. The price of coal balls has risen sharply in the past few months.</p>
<h3>The Perilous Yellow Sea: Yacht Lost at Sea, Two Young Men Barely Escape with Their Lives</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported on the 10th of this month, translating news from the "North-China Daily News," that a Swedish sailor was attempting a daring voyage from Shanghai to Manila in an old yacht named Ella, harboring grand plans of crossing the Pacific Ocean by a small boat. According to the Shanghai Times, the yacht was struck by a huge wave and sank in the Yangtze River, eighty miles from Shanghai. Only the two young Scandinavian sailors, Jakobsen and Hansen, both skilled swimmers, managed to avoid becoming food for the fish. They arrived in the central district of the city the day before yesterday afternoon, enjoying a hearty meal at a restaurant, their first in four days. Their account of the ordeal follows:</p>
<p>Water Heroes, Only Eighteen</p>
<p>Jakobsen is Swedish and Hansen is Danish. Both are eighteen years old and have considered themselves seasoned sailors since they were fifteen. Five months ago, they arrived in Shanghai on a Norwegian ship and decided to stay. Within these five months, they saved enough money to purchase the yacht Ella. The yacht was already forty-seven years old, with a weak keel and an unstable rudder. Some warned them that while the yacht might be able to sail in the Huangpu River, it would not withstand the pounding of raging waves on a voyage to Manila. However, the two dismissed the warnings with a laugh, renaming the yacht "Ella the Adventure." Even before setting sail, they encountered unfavorable circumstances. When a typhoon passed over Shanghai, the yacht collided with other ships, damaging its side. Two nights before leaving Shanghai, it was also burgled. Blankets, pajamas, a water tank, and some equipment vanished without a trace. Customs officials even warned them of potential interception by the Japanese along the way. However, the two disregarded these concerns and finally set sail at 6 AM on the 7th of this month.</p>
<p>Rudder Detached, Water Pours In, Impossible to Steer</p>
<p>That day, they smoothly exited the port at noon and entered the Yangtze River. Unexpectedly, the strong wind died down, and a powerful tide surged up. The small boat was carried back to the Wusongkou with the tide. They set sail again at 3 PM, and things were calm. On the morning of the 8th, the boat entered the Yellow Sea and immediately seemed fragile, repeatedly struck by huge waves. The rudder gradually detached from the stern, and seawater started to leak in. By noon, the water inside the boat had accumulated significantly. They tried their best to bail it out, but they could not completely remove the water from the boat. It was also impossible to repair the rudder, and the sea became increasingly turbulent. They decided to return to Shanghai. Just as they entered the Yangtze River, within two miles of the shore, the small boat could no longer hold up. The rudder completely detached from the stern, and river water poured into the boat even faster, causing it to sink. The two barely escaped with their lives. In the swift current, they took off their clothes, leaving only their underwear, and swam towards the shore. However, they were swept away by the current and could only swim parallel to the shore. After struggling for two hours in the constantly rising and falling waves, they were exhausted and finally managed to crawl ashore about two and a half miles from where the boat sank.</p>
<p>Exhausted Landing, Fortunately Surviving</p>
<p>They walked inland a little and came across a small village. The villagers were shocked by the bedraggled appearance of the two men. The incident was reported to the Japanese officer stationed in the village, who suspected them of being spies. They were taken to the barracks and interrogated in detail. Jakobsen wrote a note, which was sent by a Japanese soldier to the Swedish consulate in Shanghai. They were detained in the camp for two days. On the 10th at noon, they were escorted by Japanese soldiers and taken by train to a place in Pudong, where they were handed over to the care of the Swedish consulate staff. Only then were they able to change clothes and return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Restricts the Import of French Currency</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs in this city has placed restrictions on the import of French currency. The limit for those arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong is 1,500 Imperial dollars. Anything exceeding this limit will be confiscated. However, if the currency is shipped through customs from Xiamen, Shantou, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other places, the amount can reach up to 10,000 dollars. The ships used for this type of shipment must sail directly to Shanghai and are not allowed to call at other ports. It is uncertain when or how these restrictions may change.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Commander Koga Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, has recently been transferred to the position of commander of the Yokosuka Naval District in Japan. The vacant position of commander of the fleet stationed in China has been filled by Vice Admiral Koga Mineichi, as announced by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy. It is reported that Koga arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese liaison ship Nagasaki Maru at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday (the 10th), landing at the Yangshupu Wharf. At that time, the Japanese authorities in this city implemented special security measures at the wharf, temporarily cutting off traffic.</p>
<h3>British Consul Accompanied by Chairman of the Municipal Council Visits U.S. Consul General for General Observations, Important Discussions Expected</h3>
<p>According to foreign news reports, at 10 AM the day before yesterday, the British Consul General in Shanghai, George, unexpectedly visited the U.S. Consulate General on Jiangxi Road, accompanied by Liddell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. They were received by the U.S. Consul General, Lockhart, and had a lengthy discussion until about 11 AM before departing. General observers believe that the discussion between the two Consuls General must have involved important matters.</p>
<h3>U.S. Destroyer Henderson Still Not Seen, President Cleveland Returns to the U.S. Yesterday, Did Not Carry Any Cargo on This Trip</h3>
<p>Rumors have been circulating recently that the U.S. Presidential Liner has been ordered to evacuate overseas Chinese, and that the destroyer Henderson has also arrived in Shanghai. According to investigations: (1) Fewer than one hundred American citizens left Shanghai on the President Cleveland last night. All of them voluntarily left Shanghai due to personal reasons and had nothing to do with the evacuation of overseas Chinese. (2) The destroyer Henderson did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>President Cleveland Arrives Empty</p>
<p>The U.S. President Line's President Cleveland sailed directly from the U.S. to Luzon, via Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai at around 4 PM the day before yesterday (the 10th) and berthed at buoys 12 and 13. It was scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the U.S. at midnight yesterday, as reported in previous newspapers. It has been learned that the company also has the mail ship President Taylor and two cargo ships, SS James Rykes and SS Zsella Rykes, which arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday. The President Cleveland carried a large amount of cargo to the Philippines from the U.S., but no cargo for this city. There was also no American wheat. However, the cargo for the U.S. from this city was congested. Passengers returning to the U.S. on the mail ship, including American naval officers withdrawing from Japan, totaled more than 110 people. The President Taylor will set sail south tonight. Another cargo ship has been slightly delayed due to loading and unloading cargo.</p>
<p>Henderson's Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>According to information from the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Navy transport ship Henderson was expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of this month, but there has been no news of it so far. As of last night, it had not arrived. The report yesterday that the battleship had arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM the day before yesterday was completely inaccurate. The exact date of the ship's arrival in Shanghai is still unknown.</p>
<p>Seven Foreign Warships in Port</p>
<p>The number of foreign warships anchored in the Huangpu River has recently increased. According to reports from the Daguan News Agency, there are currently seven foreign warships in the Huangpu River. The U.S. ship Luzon is anchored at the British naval buoy. The French ships Grogner, Belair, and Voleg are anchored off the French Avenue Bund and Gaochangmiao. The Italian ships Eritrea, Carlotto, and Lepanto are anchored at buoys 20, 21, and 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Indian Nationals Delayed, Left Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson's Taishun, which arrived in Shanghai to transport Indian nationals back to their home country, was originally scheduled to set sail on the 10th. However, due to a slight delay in the embarkation of some Indian nationals, it was postponed until 6 PM yesterday before departing for Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Calcutta, and other places. It is estimated that dozens of Indian nationals from this city boarded the ship to return home, most of whom are relatives of Indian police officers in the Municipal Council, as they have no need to reside in Shanghai. Very few of them are women and children. One gray-haired Indian national, who has lived in China for more than 20 years, was overcome with emotion at the prospect of leaving Shanghai and returning home. When the ship set sail, several Indian police officers rushed to the Rossieford Wharf to bid farewell to their relatives. The ship also carried more than 2,000 cases of Jardine Matheson beer to India.</p>
<p>French Ships Resume Japan Route</p>
<p>According to news from the French Postal Shipping Company yesterday, the company's Kindia will sail directly from Shanghai to Yokohama, Japan, on the 17th of this month. After loading cargo, it will sail to Vietnam. French ships have suspended voyages to Japanese ports for several months. Now that they have decided to resume the route, other ships may continue to sail to Japanese ports. The Bena Saint Pierre, which previously carried more than 4,000 tons of coal from Haiphong, is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Haiphong tomorrow and will continue to carry coal to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Izumo Departs Shanghai</p>
<p>The Japanese flagship Izumo, which has been anchored in the Huangpu River for a long time near the China Merchants dock, raised its fire and prepared to sail yesterday morning. It left the Huangpu River at around 9 AM and exited the Wusongkou around 11 AM. Its destination is unknown.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Tax and Vehicle License Matters Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the City Center District are expected to be completed soon. After that, all vehicles traveling on roads outside the Shanghai West boundary will be required to display licenses from the City Center District. Regarding this matter, Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, told reporters that the negotiations have not yet concluded, so he could not comment. It is reported that Fessenden continued the discussions on Tuesday, discussing the license fees and taxes in the area outside the Shanghai West boundary. Some believe that the current negotiations may conclude at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Water and Electricity Not Yet Restored</h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the Chinese army successively recaptured the key points of Fuzhou and Mawei. People from Fujian Province in Shanghai are eager to telegraph their hometowns to inquire about the current situation. According to the American Commercial Wireless Telegraph Company, the company has received too many telegrams between Shanghai and Fujian recently and is unable to send and receive them all at once. It will not be able to resume normal operations until it has processed them in a few days. The Datung and Great Northern Telegraph lines have not yet started sending and receiving due to a temporary lack of organization. It is said that the period will not be too far off.</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment for Prisoner Mail</h3>
<p>Mail and packages sent to French prisoners of war during the war were previously stipulated to be forwarded free of charge through Indochina. Now, letters and packages sent to prisoners of other nationalities can also be received and sent without postage. The procedure is the same as for sending to French prisoners. The post office has notified foreign senders in this city to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Renewal of Rickshaw Driver Licenses</h3>

<h3>Applications for Scholarships Difficult to Approve: Those Unemployed and Those Who Submit Late Applications Are Truly Beyond Help, Please Be Understanding and Forgiving</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Christian Association's scholarship program for industrial and commercial employees closed applications on the 5th of this month, and the list of students approved for scholarships has been fully announced. However, many more industrial and commercial employees have continued to send letters of application in recent days, which is difficult to respond to individually. To avoid disappointing those who have sent letters, we are providing a general response. The association has repeatedly announced the application deadline. We sympathize with the enthusiasm for learning of those who have lost their schooling, but we cannot help but feel regret for those who have not followed the established procedures, especially those who have submitted late applications despite their strong desire for knowledge. Those involved in handling various procedures must abide by the regulations of the committee. Therefore, we can only regretfully be unable to help those who have submitted late applications. In addition, there are also those who have only sent letters requesting scholarships without even picking up and filling out application forms. Even if they had not submitted late applications, they would still be in violation of the procedures, let alone now that the application period has ended. In addition, there are more than 200 unemployed and out-of-school individuals who have sent letters applying for scholarships. The association also deeply understands that the pain of being unemployed and out of school is undoubtedly greater than that of industrial and commercial employees who have lost their schooling. Those who have not been approved, because the industrial and commercial group stipulates that proof from a store, firm, manager, or person in charge is a necessary condition, cannot be changed. We hope that those who have submitted late applications and those who are unemployed will be understanding and forgiving.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Payment Needed Quickly</h3>
<p>As of yesterday, more than 30 industrial and commercial scholarship recipients had not yet claimed their payments. In addition, many students changed schools yesterday and have now completed the procedures. They can come to the business department of this newspaper between 2 PM and 5 PM this afternoon to claim their scholarships, so that this newspaper can complete the settlement procedures as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tang Jianxing, originally at Meng Xianying College, has changed to Cambridge English College due to inconvenient class times. A scholarship of 22 dollars has been approved.</p>
<p>Qiu Fuchun, Dai Xinyue, and Wang Xinming, originally at the China Vocational Supplementary School, have changed to Dalu English College due to conflicting class and work times. Replacement checks have been issued, and the scholarships remain the same. The original three checks have been returned.</p>
<p>Shen Jinlong, Xiao Yunxun, and Xia Keyu, originally at the Yada Wireless Radio School, have all changed to the Fifth China Supplementary School because the evening classes were full. Scholarships have been approved for Shen (24 dollars), Xiao (12 dollars), and Xia (12 dollars). The previous checks have been returned.</p>
<p>You Zhongqiu has changed to Shoujian Chinese Stenography School. A scholarship of 22 dollars has been approved. The previous check has been returned.</p>
<p>Feng Erqing, a scholarship of 10 dollars for the Textile Dyeing Industry School has been reissued.</p>
<p>Xu Qinfang, a scholarship of 60 dollars for the Hudong Gongshe Automobile School (Repair Department) has been reissued.</p>
<h3>Lu Xun's Thirty Years Collection</h3>
<p>— Yulin</p>
<p>It has been five years since the death of Mr. Lu Xun. His fighting spirit remains in the world and is expanding more widely, deeply rooted in the hearts of young people. Mr. Guo Moruo said: "Before Lu Xun, there was no Lu Xun; after Lu Xun, there are countless Lu Xun." Lu Xun was truly great. Indeed, Lu Xun's era was a most oppressive era, a transition period between light and darkness. As a righteous intellectual, he clearly marked this page of history with his pen. He did not see the current national liberation war, but his driving force has guided thousands upon thousands of Chinese youth. His epic "In my dreams, I vaguely recall my mother's tears, on the city walls, the kings change banners" will forever exist as an immortal masterpiece of the era's literature and art. His sharp essays are also models in the fighting camp. Some say that he inherited the ideological form of Gong Ding'an. This is an ideological interpretation. He is truly the Chinese Maxim Gorky.</p>
<p>He was the most unique warrior in feudal and capitalist societies. He never lagged behind and always stood at the forefront of the era.</p>
<p>The Lu Xun Commemorative Committee, at this time and place, after printing "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," is continuing its efforts by publishing "Lu Xun's Thirty Years Collection" to commemorate this great man. The spirit is admirable.</p>
<p>The publication of Lu Xun's Thirty Years of Creative Works in 1941 is a very meaningful commemoration.</p>
<p>The name "Thirty Years Collection" refers to all of Mr. Lu Xun's writings from 1906 to 1936. The content includes: creative novels such as "Call to Arms" and "Wandering"; prose poems such as "Wild Grass"; and "Grave," "Supplement," "Remnants," etc., which contain classical Chinese, vernacular, poetry, and other texts. They are spicy, sincere, and appear in the cultural field in the form of throwing spears and daggers, with a distinctive style. He was the pioneer of essays of this era, from "Hot Wind" to "Qiejieting Essays," forming a great work of more than ten volumes. The spirit throughout is consistent, with the goal of revitalizing the nation and exposing the darkness. Other correct arrangements for ancient novels and old literature can be seen in his compilation and editing of "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," "An Outline History of Han Literature," "Gou Chen of Ancient Novels," "Ji Kang's Collection," and so on. According to statistics, there are a total of 29 books, totaling 30 volumes.</p>
<p>As early as 1936, it is said that Mr. Lu Xun intended to compile and print this collection himself, but unfortunately he fell ill and died, and did not live to see it completed. Now, with the love and encouragement of people in the cultural circle and the enthusiastic efforts of the gentlemen of the Lu Xun Complete Works Publishing House, it has been decided to start pre-ordering this September and publish the book on schedule in October.</p>
<p>It is said that the table of contents of the collection will be arranged in chronological order of the works. During the four years from 1929 to 1932, Mr. Lu Xun devoted himself to the introduction of translations of social science works, etc., and had no time to take care of the printing of his own works. Regrettably, in the tenth item of the second catalog of the Thirty Years Collection drafted by Mr. Lu Xun himself, there is "Three Books on the Awakening of Faith" without specifying its meaning, which may include "Ji Kang's Collection," "Xie Cheng's Later Han Book," and "Ling Biao Lu Yi," but the latter two have not been seen to this day. Fortunately, this publication also includes "An Outline History of Han Literature" and "Miscellaneous Collections of Ancient Books from Kuaiji Prefecture," and the amount of "Remnants from the Collection" is even more substantial than expected.</p>
<p>It is difficult to reprint "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," and the ones available on the market are priced extremely high. The publication of "Lu Xun's Thirty Years Collection" is undoubtedly a good opportunity for readers. We can wait and see.</p>
<h3>Million Dollar Cash Seized, Nine Passengers Arrested</h3>
<p>It is said that several days ago, someone attempted to smuggle 1 million National dollars into Shanghai in the furnace room of Jardine Matheson's Taishun, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai. It was discovered and confiscated by customs officers. Another account says that more than 800,000 National dollars were also seized at the same wharf from the company's Dingsheng, which arrived at the same time. However, according to a sudden report from the News Agency yesterday, when a certain ship arrived in port a few days ago, customs officers seized a huge sum of 1 million dollars in cash on board the ship. At the same time, police officers from the French Concession arrested nine passengers who were privately carrying the huge sum. The investigation is still underway. It is reported that the huge sum of cash was used to speculate on foreign exchange and other illicit gains.</p>
<h3>Attempted Kidnapping, Three Robbers Arrested, Rickshaw Driver Escapes</h3>
<p>The owner of the Wanfengxiang Customs Brokerage, surnamed Qin, at No. 15 Shenxin Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession, was suddenly visited by three uninvited guests at 8:45 PM last night. All of them were wearing gray long gowns and pulled out a pistol, attempting to kidnap him. Fortunately, Qin was alert and signaled to an apprentice, who sneaked out of the back door to a neighbor and borrowed a phone to report to the Maitland Police Station. A large number of detectives rushed to the scene. A robber's car was parked in the lane. The driver, realizing that the plot had been exposed, quickly drove away without a trace. All three robbers were arrested on the spot, and a pistol was seized. They were detained in the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Employee of Ryan &amp; Co. Commits Fraud and Obtains Money, Jiang Xuelong Arrested</h3>
<p>Ryan &amp; Co. at No. 461 Avenue Joffre had previously rented a vacant lot on Route Courbet to build several city houses and advertised for rent. Unexpectedly, Jiang Xuelong (31 years old, residing at No. 2 Lane 248, Fuli Road), a local employee of the company, took advantage of his position to defraud Huang Guande, manager of the Lafayette Theater, of 500 dollars in down payments and gratuities, as well as Huang Yuwen at No. 1 Lane 4, Chunwu Lane, Route Hodebert, of 2,340 dollars in down payments and gratuities, Yang Bingyi at No. 1894 Jing'an Temple Road of 576 dollars in down payments and gratuities, and Shen Weijia at No. 100 Renji Road of 576 dollars in down payments and gratuities. He forged the name and handwriting of Ryan, the manager of the company, and issued receipts. After a long time, because there were no houses to deliver, the parties directly contacted Ryan &amp; Co. and realized that they had been deceived by Jiang. They reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Jiang. During the interrogation, Jiang admitted to the fraud and forging of receipts. The police chief charged Jiang with both fraud and forging private documents. To ensure that no one else had been deceived and harmed, he ordered him to be detained for further investigation to determine if he had committed any other crimes before proceeding with the case. It is reported that Jiang used this method to defraud a total of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Has Specifically Issued "Notes on Implementing People's Education," Those Who Fail to Implement Effectively Will Have Their National Education Funding Appropriately Reduced</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) In May of this year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to various places to inspect the people's education section of central primary schools and national schools. According to the reports of various inspectors, the people's education sections of central primary schools and national schools in various places mostly did not comply with the principles promulgated by the Ministry. Therefore, the "Notes on Implementing People's Education Section in Various Schools" were re-formulated and issued to the relevant departments, requiring them to earnestly implement the various points in the Ministry's promulgated notes. The method is recorded below: Notes on Implementing People's Education Section in Central Schools and National Schools in Various Provinces and Cities: (1) Central schools and national schools established in various provinces since the first semester of the 30th year must set up a people's education section, mainly to operate senior and junior adult classes and women's classes. (2) In order to effectively supervise the operation of the people's education sections of various schools, various provinces and cities should intensify publicity work to correct the past views of school faculty and staff and people in society that neglect adult supplementary education.

<h3>Western Football Club Annual Meeting Decides to Set Up a Separate Chinese League, It is Said that the Police Authorities Oppose Sino-Western Football Matches, Registration Deadline Postponed, New Officers Elected Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football Club held its annual meeting yesterday at the Sichuan Road Engineer's Association, and passed the secretary's report of the previous session and the accounting statements, and elected the officers for this session. The most important proposal was the issue of Chinese teams participating in this year's competition. Since the Yiyuan incident in the spring, the French Concession Police Department has prohibited football matches. In order to avoid the recurrence of accidental incidents, it is said that the police authorities of the two concessions still do not allow Chinese and Western teams to hold competitions. Therefore, the following decision was made on the issue of Chinese teams participating in yesterday's annual meeting:</p>
<p>Separate Chinese Group Because many Chinese teams participated in this year's competition, and the police authorities oppose Chinese and Western teams holding competitions, it was decided to set up a separate Chinese league group, and the registration period will be extended to the 25th of this month. The Shanghai Western Football Club is willing to do its best to help this competition be established.</p>
<p>Re-election of New Officers Captain Li Te, the president of the previous session, was elected as a lifetime member of the Western Club. Li Min will soon take leave and leave Shanghai. The list of other new officers is as follows: President Capez, Vice Presidents Cowart, Marshall, Xu, Ackison, Wei Chang Pei Long, Bu Tuo, Forbes, Pesoes, Reis, Appeals Committee Bu Li Qi, Bowei Er, Kliefert, Ge Si, Yue Xiu Rong, League Management Committee Cowart, Marshall, Pesoes, Edward, Kim Bo, Faras, School Group Reis, Spike, McCotai, Secretary Still Spike.</p>
<h3>Handicap Basketball, Division Champions Produced, Shanghai Star and Tongren Starting the Finals Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The second Handicap Basketball Championship, after more than two months of competition, came to an end yesterday afternoon. The champions of Divisions One and Two were also produced at the same time yesterday. The champion of Division One originally belonged to Qianghua, but since Qianghua was the host, it was announced immediately that if they won the championship in the future, they would give way to the team with the second most points. Therefore, the right to the finals of the overall championship was given to the runner-up Shanghai Star. In Division Two, both Huaqiang and Tongren had ten wins and one loss in eleven games. A rematch was held yesterday, Huaqiang still gave twenty points, but due to the absence of Wang Jinghu, the result was a failure of 86 to 52. The championship of Division Two then belonged to Tongren. Now Shanghai Star and Tongren are scheduled to start the championship finals tomorrow (Saturday). The two-team system will be used for the competition, and the second game is scheduled for next Tuesday (16th). The results of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>
<p>Yougong beat Dalu (Division Two) 42 to 41, (Yougong gave 15 points)</p>

<h3>The Joy of Family</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>"There are no wrong parents in the world." Why do I say this? The nature of parents in the world and their children originally have no wrong places, and everything can come from the most sincere feelings and nature: children for their parents? It is also like this.</p>
<p>Originally, the family should be the most reasonable combination, harmonious and mixed, enjoying the joy of family, "looking to the left at the wife, there are children playing," which is the original face of life. Since the clan society in history, the family system has been perfectly established, and then to the serf society, feudal society, and to the capitalist society, although the family form has changed, its cornerstone - the joy of family - has always existed and developed. I believe that society will continue to develop, and the feelings of parents and children will also be maintained infinitely. Consult social scientists and believe that there is evidence, not as a唯心论.</p>
<p>The problem is how to maintain the feelings of family. Emperor Taizong of Tang once said with emotion: it is easy to govern the world, but difficult to manage a family. The family is originally different from the big society, and parents and children must be frank and not perfunctory, and understand each other in thought and action, which is "understanding." Parents and children are originally figures of two eras, each with its own feelings and opinions, but parents have also been young, and what children need is life experience. Although they are slightly different, it does not hinder the great harmony. Everyone works together in harmony, which is not impossible, and there is no need for opposition, so we can seek "harmony."</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect. There is this consistency; in the horizontal aspect, it should also be reasonable. If there is discord between husband and wife, it is a major pain for the children, and they will eventually develop a kind of hatred in their hearts. Therefore, parents should seek good-intentioned prevention and control.</p>
<p>Speaking only of children being disobedient, we must look at all aspects of children's actions. Children without the joy of family are tantamount to killing half of their lives. Duke Zhuang of Zheng has the sigh of "You have a mother to leave, why am I alone without one", is this not from the bottom of his heart? Naturally, children have a happy future, but they need parental guidance, and there is no reason for a third party to bury them; in case children feel oppressed and ashamed, and are willing to sacrifice the light of youth, that is also not worth it. The so-called unspeakable pain of shame in the midst is definitely not to be borne by the next generation, but rather the parents' remorse.</p>
<h3>Advertisements and Trademarks The First Thing I Think of Is Me</h3>
<p>— San San</p>
<p>One evening, Yong and I were walking silently on a not-so-lively road. Suddenly, I asked:</p>
<p>"Yong, which street do you think is the most bustling?" Yong raised his head and looked around, unable to answer for a moment.</p>
<p>So I pointed to the neon sign across the street from a shop and said, "It's more lively over there!" The words on the neon light were reversed.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think the naming of company codes and entertainment venues should be like "Paramount", "Little Luzon", "MGM", "Golden Gate"... so that you can save another neon light installation - how good is a "full house" neon light? On the one hand, it can be seen from a distance, so as not to cause the "missed opportunity" to be boring, and on the other hand, it can show that the theater's full house is "commonplace." I have never published it to others.</p>
<p>A month ago, I drafted my plan outline for a classified advertisement in the newspaper "Seeking (Business) Talents to Cooperate Sincerely" as follows: "(1) Create a unique trademark that can be applied for registration and exclusive use. Its effect can reduce costs by half and will never be affected by rising raw material prices. (2) This business method can be applied for a patent."</p>
<p>However, when I soon saw other recruitment advertisements that had been posted for several days in a row: "Patent New Business Seeks Cooperation", "Invest in New Inventions and Highly Profitable Industry", I don't know why I lost the courage to submit my application.</p>
<p>Then, the Seven Day Newspaper carried: "Lawyer's Statement on Behalf of Tobacco Company Using 'Billboard' Cigarettes." Oh my God! It turned out to be the "Billboard Cigarettes" that I was thinking of. I had planned for it: If each pack of shell surface and cigarette sticks each charge an advertising fee of five cents or a dime, it can reduce most of the cost; and I planned how to obtain patent rights to resist the extremely possible "Advertisement" brands of Adevo in the future...</p>
<p>Who knows that you will also think of it? If you don't say a word. But what's the use of saying it?</p>
<p>For Yourself and Others, You Must "Service-ize Your Career" Heart Source</p>
<p>In the current world, people generally do everything possible to benefit their own careers, unscrupulously engaging in behaviors that harm others and benefit themselves, causing all the misfortunes in the world. Therefore, here at home, I want to loudly advocate: "Service-ize Your Career".</p>
<p>What is service-izing your career? It means that everyone should regard their own private career as a kind of public undertaking. My engagement in this kind of career is no different from serving the public. I must take into account the interests of the public.</p>
<p>I believe that if everyone can hold such a purpose to engage in their own careers, the existing misfortunes in the world can definitely be eliminated a lot. However, on your own side, you will definitely not lose, but you can get supreme benefits. Because if everyone can do this, under the "mutual benefit" of the public, it must be more cost-effective than "private benefit".</p>
<p>Now let's give an example to strengthen your will:</p>
<p>Like "Madame Curie" of France, she is the inventor of the cancer-curing special product "radium". After she worked so hard to discover "radium" in pitchblende ore, she did not apply for a patent. All the discoveries and all the extraction procedures of radium were published completely, and even the "copyright" of the works was not reserved.</p>
<p>She was sympathized with by the American people, and later gave her two huge sums of money twice, but Madame Curie asked them to buy radium. Once it was placed in a public hospital to benefit patients, and once it was used as her own research material. Madame Curie is the inventor of radium, but she doesn't have it herself!</p>
<p>After reading the above example, are you moved? I don't expect everyone to be a second Madame Curie, but I hope to achieve one or two tenths of her.</p>
<p>Anecdotal Tales</p>
<h3>Biographies of People in the Civet Cat Case</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Two Empress Liu</p>
<p>Emperor Renzong was the main character in this case, and Empress Liu was the most important character in this case. Empress Liu was from Chengdu. Her mother dreamed of the moon and then became pregnant. She was orphaned at a young age and raised in her maternal family. When she grew up, she was good at playing the rattle drum. At the age of fifteen, she met a craftsman from Shu who made silver. He took her to Beijing and entered the residence of Prince Xiang. Prince Xiang was the title of Emperor Zhenzong when he was in his potential residence. Emperor Zhenzong's wet nurse, Wang, was strict and proper, and told Emperor Taizong about her, ordering Emperor Zhenzong to expel her. Emperor Zhenzong had no choice but to hide her in the house of Zhang Qi, the director of the palace.</p>
<p>When Emperor Taizong died, Emperor Zhenzong ascended the throne and made her a beauty. Because she had no clan, he ordered her to change her surname to Liu. Since the death of Empress Guo, Emperor Zhenzong wanted to make her empress, but many ministers thought it was impossible. Therefore, it was not until the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu that she was conferred the title. At that time, Emperor Renzong was still in infancy. When Emperor Zhenzong died, Emperor Renzong ascended the throne and listened to the government as Empress Dowager for eleven years, and died at the age of sixty-five.</p>
<p>From the above facts, we know that Emperor Zhenzong loved Empress Liu and never changed his mind. As for why Empress Liu was able to always win Emperor Zhenzong's favor, of course, Liu must have talent, appearance, and personality that could make the emperor's heart inclined; based on the speculation in the history books, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of model person Empress Liu was. (1) Why did one person in Prince Xiang's mansion not be liked by the strict-natured wet nurse of Wang, and even told Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Taizong also wanted to expel her and then stop, which shows that she was "not strict." And Emperor Zhenzong was reluctant to give up and still wanted to place her in Zhang Qi's house in order to reunite, which shows that she was a "sly person who can confuse the master." (2) If she only relied on color and favor, she would not be able to last long, because love fades with age. History calls her "She has a sharp mind, knows history, and can annotate the whole story of the court's affairs. Emperor Zhenzong retired from the court and read the memorials of the world until midnight, and she always heard about them in advance. When there were questions about palace affairs, she often used the old facts to answer. In the fourth year of Tianxi, the emperor was ill for a long time and lived in the palace, and many things were decided by her." With such talent, how could the Emperor Zhenzong not be infatuated and trust her without decline?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Storms</p>
<p>She originally wanted to say, "But I can't come back for the time being," but she was afraid of saying it too clearly, so she hurriedly changed the subject.</p>
<p>"However, your old man's own body is the most important thing. You have lost a lot of weight these days. I'll send you a few more boxes of lotus root flour tomorrow"! In the simple brain of this little housekeeper of the Meng family, lotus root flour seemed to be a medicine more effective than ginseng, so whenever she encountered someone who was not feeling well, she always advised them to eat lotus root flour.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia could only thank her a few times for her ignorant kindness and be done with it. In fact, he also suspected that this woman knew something about Mei Bao's disappearance, but he knew that he didn't dare to say it, so he didn't bother to ask.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he didn't listen to the Meng family's daughter-in-law and didn't eat lotus root flour that his spirit became more and more tired; although he still struggled to get up every day, people who saw him couldn't help but ask in surprise:</p>
<p>"Why are you sick again?"</p>
<p>In fact, he was already sick! By the time Principal Fang's second letter arrived, almost all he ate every day was a bowl of millet porridge.</p>
<p>The news in the second letter seemed to be better than the first letter. (209)</p>

<h3>The Process of Yu Zhenfei Going Down to the Sea (Part 1) Shao Xian (From Beiping)</h3>
<p>Speaking of the affair between Cheng Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei, I want to use a different writing style, starting from the level of Cheng Yanqiu's supporting actor Xiaosheng. When Cheng Yanqiu formed his own troupe, some of his supporting actors were amateur actors who had gone down to the sea from the Chunyang Friendship Association. Although these characters were amateur actors who had gone down to the sea, they did help Yanqiu become famous. These were Xiaosheng Sheng Youquan, Laosheng Guo Zhongheng, and Laodan Wen Liangchen. At that time, it was the era when Luo Yinggong and Jin Zhongsun were madly supporting Yanqiu. Luo and Jin successively arranged many new plays for Yanqiu. Among these new plays, the three of Wang, Guo, and Wen occupied the most important position, so Yanqiu regarded these three as his right and left hands. I forgot what year it was that they were moved, so they left Yanqiu and supported E Yun. Yanqiu was greatly affected by this change, but fortunately Yanqiu had a way to resolve the danger and still survived the difficulties. Otherwise, Yanqiu's defection by Wang Youquan would have hindered the overall situation, or perhaps there would be no current status. And Wang's ruthlessness is still unforgettable to Yanqiu. After Wang Youquan left Yanqiu, because he had performed with Yanqiu for many years, Wang could perform all of Yanqiu's private plays, and he used this as a gimmick. First he cooperated with Zhang Eyun, and later he played with Xin Yanqiu. Today, the Cheng school plays sung by Eyun Yuhua (Xin Yanqiu) were taught by Youquan back then.</p>
<p>Yuan Xuefen is the leader of the Sijichun Troupe and the leading actress of the Dalai Theatre. She has a clear appearance and dignified demeanor. She is especially suitable for the role of a lady from a wealthy family. Her cooperation with Ma Zhanghua in plays such as "The Sad History of Liang Zhu" and "Three Visits to the Imperial Sister" have unique points and can be called a perfect match. She is meticulous in her work, and whenever she performs to the point of sophistication, she always makes the audience fascinated. Since Zhanghua became a concubine, she left Dalai to form her own troupe, which is deeply regretted by those who hear about it. — Bing Yi Furen</p>
<h3>Wei Ruhe's Fairy Tale Play</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Following "Peach Blossom Spring", Wei Ruhe wrote his second fairy tale play, "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." The author uses Freud's psychoanalysis. The bad guys in the real world become demons in the dream, and the good people are rewarded with immortals. In this respect, it is indeed similar to the "Wizard of Oz" movie.</p>
<p>The meaning of this play is very profound. The search for happiness reminds me of Maeterlinck's "The Blue Bird". If "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" can be called "Magpie" or "Happiness Bird", it is really a good story of Eastern and Western beauty! However, like "The Blue Bird" and "Peter Pan", they always make good fairy tale dreams, only giving children warmth and intoxication, and will not reveal the ugly reality. Therefore, from beginning to end, it is like a thin mist and light gauze, giving people a smooth feeling, and cannot make people vigilant and alert. However, the fairy tale plays that come with Ruhe are somewhat terrifying, and the meaning is very profound. I think it is suitable for students in senior elementary school and the first and second grades of junior high school to watch. I hope that parents can take their children to appreciate this meaningful fairy tale play; as for junior elementary school students, I think it is not suitable.</p>
<p>The author is a member of the reformed Peking Opera and has long intended to cooperate with Jin Suqin and Zhang Yipeng. This time he has also realized part of his ideals, but it is a drama that has been made into a Peking Opera. For example: in the first act, the Weaver Girl (Shen) sings the domino song, which uses the Chuichang (the tunes of Selling Horses, Beheading Jingtao, and Hundred Flowers Pavilion). In the second act, the demon king spits fire from his mouth, which is like the Kun operas such as Zhong Kui Marrying His Sister or the Fire Judge. The actions of foxes, tigers, wolves, dogs, and rabbits are all guided by Zhang Yipeng, especially the snake spirit action taught by Jin Suqin. In the fourth act, the stone monkey somersaults, and in the fifth act, the goddess (Lan Lan) dances, and the immortals play with silk scarves, singing according to the sound of drums (the tunes of Overlord Bidding Farewell to His Concubine, Cao Cao Cursing the Drum): All of these are often seen and heard in Peking Opera, and now they have all been moved to drama.</p>
<p>"This pair of rural lovers finally became a family with their perseverance." Suddenly, I thought of Eino's "Pioneers" in Finland.</p>
<h3>The Heavenly Palace Will Perform "Under the Pomegranate Skirt"</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>Since the Heavenly Palace Theater began a long-term performance with China Travel, the play "Grape Wine" has been very popular with audiences and has broken records in box office sales. This play was originally intended to be performed for a maximum of two weeks, and then a new program would be changed. Unexpectedly, it became more and more popular and could not be stopped, so it had to be continued. It has now exceeded three weeks. Although all the actors have been working hard from beginning to end, due to the long performance period, and the play has not adopted the AB system, actors such as Sun Jinglu and Zhao Shu have been performing on stage while sick for several days. It is learned that the troupe decided yesterday that "Grape Wine" will be performed until the 15th and will not be continued. It is estimated that the scheduled plays "Under the Pomegranate Skirt", "Green Blood and Yellow Sand", and "Dong Xiaowan", except for "Dong Xiaowan" which has not yet been rehearsed, the other two plays have been completely rehearsed, so it was decided to replace the five-act comedy "Under the Pomegranate Skirt" from the 16th. It is said that this play is a comedy with a lot of gimmicks. A few years ago, when China Travel was in Beiping, it was performed at Tsinghua University at the invitation of the university. The laughter in the venue almost made it impossible for the performance to proceed on stage. This can also be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain, Exquisite Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Escaping the Cage with Beloved Bird</p>
<p>After exchanging pleasantries, Tian Hongyu said to Wu Sangui, "I have long admired the General's divine and martial prowess. I was fortunate to meet you at the Emperor's banquet the other day, a great honor. This old man has long desired to establish a friendship with the General, but lacked the opportunity. Now that the General is summoned and stationed in the capital, I have specially invited the General to grace my humble abode for a chat, to cultivate a lasting friendship. In my humble home, I usually keep a troupe of female musicians, solely for the purpose of entertaining my twilight years and slightly comforting my old age. Their melodious sounds are still pleasing to the ear. If the General would grant permission, tomorrow night I will prepare wine and delicacies, and arrange a lavish performance of female musicians. What does the General think of playing the role of Zhou Lang, appreciating the music?" Wu Sangui initially declined, saying that he was under the Emperor's orders and had to leave for the frontier immediately to handle military affairs. Military affairs were pressing, and he dared not indulge in leisurely entertainment. However, after Tian Hongyu's repeated and strong invitations, he finally agreed to come once. In fact, Wu Sangui was a lustful warrior. He was merely putting on airs in front of Tian Hongyu, deliberately refusing, not wanting to agree too readily. Moreover, he had heard that the renowned beauty of Jiangnan, Chen Yuanyuan, whom he had not yet met, was the leader of the female musicians in Tian Hongyu's mansion. He had wanted to feast his eyes on her beauty but had been unable to. It was rare for Tian Hongyu to personally come to his door with an invitation. In Wu Sangui's eyes, this was a great opportunity, so how could he pretend to be a moralist to the end and let it slip away? Poor old Tian was senile and ignorant of other people's intentions. Seeing that Wu Sangui had agreed to come, he was overjoyed. After talking for a while longer, he took his leave. He told Yuanyuan about his meeting with Wu, instructing her to lead the female musicians tomorrow night and make some preparations. Yuanyuan secretly rejoiced upon hearing this. The next day, Tian Hongyu instructed his family to prepare the utensils inside and out, making everything exceptionally luxurious. He also ordered all the female musicians to sing and play their instruments to the best of their ability and not to be impolite, so that General Wu would not underestimate the Tian family's female musicians. Everyone naturally obeyed his orders respectfully. As evening approached, Tian Hongyu had already sent his family to watch at the gate, waiting for General Wu to arrive and immediately report it. He himself changed into formal attire and sat in the Siwei Hall, waiting. (166)</p>
