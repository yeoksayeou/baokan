<p>丹京　丹麥外交部昨日　表宜日、拒不承認丹麥駐美公使擅與美國政府所簽訂之格林蘭協定、鄭重指出丹麥政府不受此項協定之束縛、並謂丹麥駐美公使考甫曼已因擅與美國簽訂該項非法協定而撤職、宣言之內容略謂、美國來電所稱、美國政府因德國已將戰區擴展至格林蘭領海、故決定　取保護格林蘭之措施、在該地建設海空軍根據地、但此項協定係美國務鄉赫爾與丹麥駐美公使考甫曼所簽訂、並非與丹麥國王或政府之特使所簽訂、且丹麥國王與政府對此事於事前一無所知、故就國際公法而論、此項協定無法律根據、根本不能成立之、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　傳丹政府受德方指使、不承認英國防衛格林蘭之新協定、茲據可靠消息、美政府對於丹麥之抗議、將置之不理、可靠方面謂、丹政府囚駐美丹使高考甫雖搜訂協定、將彼召　示儆、但考氏拒不　命、政府發言人正式稱、丹麥此舉、顯係出於德國之壓迫、故將認之爲無效、據指稱、考氏或將任流亡美國之丹政府首腦、自行處置丹美事件、包括丹船之讓渡在內、被凍結之丹　產、已可由考氏自由支配、上述一節、恐將實現、而美國亦將　速進行格林蘭根據地計劃、（十三國際電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　消息靈通方面稱、近在美國口岸被扣之丹麥商船三十艘、即將用以裝運美國戰具、行經紅海、接濟英國與已爾幹諸國之需要、丹籍船員現甚願開往紅海、但主張懸掛本國放幟而不用美旗、衆信先須有司法長之合法判定、而後丹船始可駛往紅海、惟裝貨事宜、不因之而延緩、因預料船出海時、各種法律上手續當可已解决也、刻經營非洲東海　貿易之美船若干艘、將擴張其航綫、俾可開往波賽以南之埃及口岸、（十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論巴爾幹戰爭與蘇聯</h3>
<p>隨着巴爾幹戰爭的擴大，關於蘇聯動熊連日曾有種種驚人的傳說，有如日前國際社則傳倫敦蘇方人員對納粹嚴　譴責，安格拉電訉則推測蘇聯將作非常舉措，此類消息雖多少帶些神經戰的意味·未可盡據爲信史·要是表示出此際世人對於蘇聯仰望之殷切；而値此希特勒兵鋒東向之際。邱吉爾演說中所指出的德國似擬取得烏克蘭糧庫與高加索油田，又恰是我的奮鬥一中所早已顯示了的意向。縱觀蘇方意向，最近於巴爾幹形勢之演變實寄以絕大關切，如對於保匈的幫兇行爲前後皆加以譴責，對土南的不侵協定則鼓勵其以實力抗禦侵略，咸足證明蘇方對於納粹之在巴爾幹用兵，業已充分運用之反對的暗示，所欠缺者只是公開的翻臉而已。</p>
<p>就歐戰進展過程來看，最初的戰事雖近在蘇聯邊界附近爆發，但不久即轉而在西綫擴大·縱然蘇德不侵協定在歐戰初期未能盡使蘇聯西疆確保安全。以致蘇力不得不藉重對芬作戰與合併三小國以鞏固自身國防，而在去春挪威戰事開始以至秋季的加緊對英空襲一時期中，却是任何歐洲國家都不再具有侵蘇的餘力和可能。及至英倫海峽戰事僵持而後，希特勒轉而積極經營中東歐洲以鞏固後力，把若干小國一舉予以囊括，則蘇德之間的情勢已與歐戰未發生以前完全改觀，第一，前此的波蘭羅馬尼亞保加利亞諸國以至立陶宛等二小國，都是蘇德間的緩衝國家，雙方得藉以避免直接的接觸；時至今日、這些國家不是爲雙方所合併就是形成納悴附庸，從波羅地海以迄黑海出口。兩國差不多已經完全直接接壤。到最近德軍侵人東色雷斯之後，蘇聯南疆門戶的博斯波拉斯海峽·其他位竟儼和蘇芬戰前的列寗格拉德相彷彿，如果說蘇芬戰爭的發生，只是爲了鞏固列寗格拉德的戰略地位，則博斯波拉斯的現狀更値得蘇力的嚴重考慮·第二·戰爭以前·德國較之英法聯合的國力，顯有未逮，、即與蘇聯相衡，亦僅在伯中之間；乃一年以來，納粹竟征服歐陸全部，形成拿破崙後百數十年間得未曾有的歐陸龐大帝國，雖其在對英繼續作戰期間於蘇暫無他虞，倘苦一日一敗英而後，勢必形成蘇聯的絕大威脅。第三·三國盟的在本質上只是反共公的強化，而爲了現實的理由，不能不在形式上把對蘇關係明白厘定在的文當中，藉以避免引起蘇方不安。其實這些障眼法是不能把蘇聯完全矇過的。現在德軍實力逐漸東逼，日當局又明白表示要把西比利亞鐵路納進所謂東亞共榮圈一範圍之內，三國同盟的反共反蘇性質已在逐漸顯露。而最近蘇聯縱以種種態度和行動暗示對於納粹進侵巴爾幹的反對音旨，德方對此，却我行我素，無所理會，這已明顯證明此等對德間接警告並無任何效果可言。</p>
<p>蘇聯對歐戰的一貫政策是中立自保，縱然最近事實如此，並已漸感不耐，在行動却迄未超出中立自保的範圍以外。連日蘇德石油協定的成立·與夫蘇日商約談判的屆近完成，都表示着：倘非發生意外的重大變動·蘇方比一一貫政策仍將繼續保持。但實際上，這祗是消極的，退守的，對於講信義守條的的國家自有其相當價値，但斷不是足以應付今日侵略國家的有效政策。希特勒在此際當然不願過分刺激蘇方觀感·容或將在小處予以相當讓步，有如把土希邊境的德軍後撤之類·以避免蘇德關係之吏形尖銳，然而除非納粹最後終將失敗到底，吾則就連這些讓步也必將取償之於將來，英土各方輿論，都認爲現在是蘇聯出而干涉歐戰的最好良機，無論爲蘇聯自身着想，抑或爲人類前途着想，蘇聯都不應以中立自保爲已足，假若蘇方當局認爲行動時機尙未成熟，至低限度亦當在消極方面以有效對策遏止匈保等國的實行幫兇，在積極方面竭力促成土耳其的立即履行其對英希南國的條的義務·以實力阻止納粹勢力之向巴爾幹尖端和黑海門戶進展。</p>

<p>據日文每日　聞戰稱、最近蘇聯船隻陸綫抵達上海、二月份先後到滬者、有斯摩爾尼號（譯音）、　重三千一百七十三噸科木　斯號、載重二千　百六十一噸、英多斯列亞號、載重五千三百二十六噸、三月份到滬者、蘇基耶資托號　載重四千六百噸、歌魯其號、載重三千九百七十四噸、四月份到滬者、有鳥阿科海號、載重二千三百三十八噸、科里打號、載重一千六百七十一噸、查遠東商船隊所屬之船舶、接踵來滬入港修理、庫頁島上海間每二十日即可往返一次、從事於中蘇貿易工作、此種情況、爲最近五年來所未有、故各方對蘇聯船隻之行動、頗爲注意、據傳今後十八個月內、預定蘇船尙有廿一艘陸續來瀘、蘇聯政府並將派員數名來滬、擔任修船監督、將暫住於蘇聯總領事館中、據在滬蘇聯人士之觀測、此等船隻來滬修理、在目下日蘇關係中、尙無任何對日及赤化工作者之意味，因自歐戰發生以來、英美船隻、已在遠東後退、故蘇聯遠東商船隊遂謀乘機恢復遠東航運、擴大遠東貿易、、</p>

<h3>美國海軍大觀</h3>
<p>大平洋上風雲緊急，美日戰事大有一觸即發之勢。美國海軍全貌，當爲讀者所注意。茲根據「生活」雜誌所輯「美國　軍專刋」中之材料，擇允迻譯如左。</p>
<p>假定一九四一年中，美國要在海上作戰，其艦隊將組自下列的各種軍艦，即：戰鬥艦十二艘。，航空母艦六艘；裝八英寸口徑大砲的重甲巡洋艦十八艘；六英寸口徑大砲的輕巡件艦十九艘；舊式驅逐艦七十五艘，新式驅逐艦川達八上艘，及長距離航行之潛水艇四十艘。在這許多軍艦之中，除去了担任運輸給養，襲擊敵船，和在船塢中修理刷新，以及作戰時被敵人潛　或轟炸機擊損之外，那全部的軍艦，就是美國的海軍實力了。</p>
<h3>美戰艦「伊達華」號雄姿</h3>
<p>美國的海軍實力，說起來頗爲鉅大。與英國或日本的海軍比較，成爲九——五——四的比率。美國的軍艦雖比英國爲略少，然而力量則較鉅。如果排了陣綫作戰，也許能獲勝利。但是央軍如利用封鎖，或零星的小戰，則美國弄得不好却也會戰收的呢。美國的海軍與日本的相比較，那末力量　然有裕了。美國的戰鬥艦較之日本，在速率上較爲遲緩，然而所展的鋼甲，要厚重的多，而且航行的能力也遠。美國海軍航空母艦，其能力比日本的要高上三倍。輕巡洋艦的砲火力量比日本的爲鉅天。驅逐艦的噸位較大，而速率則更快。</p>
<p>美國艦隊分爲偵察和作戰兩部。偵察部由重巡洋艦，驅逐艦，潛水艇，及飛機組成，去找尋敵人的所在地。作戰部包括一切船艦，專門攻擊敵人。戰鬥艦的力量最大，除了自已被敵人先行擊沉之外，如果發見敵艦的話，十五分鐘內，就可把她轟沉。美國的戰艦能於一分鐘中連開三决排砲，把八噸重的火藥和鋼鐵向敵人轟去。因之美國人對於她們的戰鬥艦，在進攻敵人時，認爲確具把握的哩。</p>
<p>海戰時，軍巡洋艦的職司在找尋敵蹤，輕巡洋艦遏阻敵艦的來襲。驅逐艦向敵人的巨艦施稱水雷，找尋敵方的潛艇，護蔽全部艦隊作戰。</p>
<p>除了艦舶之外，海軍中還有飛機，偵察和轟炸敵人，在空中追逐敵　，並察看他們戰艦的起火情狀。海　艦隊不圍爲直截對敵作戰利器，實在還是一個自足的大組織。這裏面自　有救謢艦，修理艦，快速率的運油船，及潛艇渡輪等。甚至還擁有流綫化的作戰陸軍，即所　海軍陸戰隊是。</p>
<p>（一）偉大的戰鬥艦</p>
<p>戰鬥艦爲浮在海上的砲壘，專爲負載大砲，及把猛烈的砲火攻擊敵人而設。艦上一切裝置，都以達到道個目標的前提。所有艦上的粗細鋼板，務須能保護艦上的大砲。艦中的大發動機。務必能把載重幾萬噸的大戰艦，在海洋中來往自如。砲搭中精密的機械，其目的就在向敵艦瞄準，加以轟擊</p>
<p>除了艦上的一切裝配外，又有一千二百個官兵，來駕駛這樣的一條大船。他們的共同目標乃在發砲攻敵。他們須有長至十年時期的訓練，倨留在這浮在海面的砲壘上。軍艦便是他們唯一的家庭。不問船上的甬道如何狹小，房間如何狹隘，他們一切都能弄得井井有條。像排水量三萬三千四百噸的「伊達華」戰艦，整個的船隻就像一個小小的城南。官兵們在艦上設置有理髮店，飲冰室，裁縫舖，和出售紀念品的小肆。這些店舖所賺下來的潤餘，他們便用來購買影戲機，無綫電收音機，及各種小件玩意兒等。因之這軍艦中的人，在舒適華麗方面，要比艦隊中其他各艦，要高明得多了。</p>
<p>在這樣偉大戰艦上的一個艦長——「伊達華」號艦長爲麥根耐氏——好像具有資本美金七千萬元一家大公司的總經理，或人口一千二百一個城市中的市長。在承平之時，他指揮船上一切事務，作戰時則率領部下與敵人拼命。照海軍中向例，這艦長一定要能過孤獨生活的人，所以歡喜熱鬧者對於這位置倒難以充任的。爲避免對人偏徇起見，艦長請人吃飯或邀客遊宴，都得仔細斟酌呢。在船上右舷後甲板上，另有他私人的台甲。當軍艦排成隊形之時，他老是站在橋樓上，不輕易離開。（未完）</p>
<h3>戰時我國之棉紡織業</h3>
<p>本文原題「戰時我國之棉紡織業及其產銷概况」，係聶先生奮中國國民經濟研究所第三續編中之中外經濟年報（將由世界　局出版）所作，分析精明，材料尤不可多得　得作者與所方同意，先在本刊發表其關於業況總述之首二段，傳讀者得先觀之快。</p>
<p>戰時之紡織業概觀</p>
<p>棉紡織業爲我國最大之工業，亦爲我國與日本經濟戰爭最烈之民族工業，戰前全國華商紗廠有紗綫錠二百九十二萬枚，布機二萬五千五百台；日商紗廠有紗綫錠二百四十九萬枚，布機二萬八千九百台；央商紗廠有紗綫錠二十三萬枚，布機四干台；粽計之爲紗綫錠五百六十四萬枚，布機五萬八千四百台。設無天災人福，國內承平樂業，則年增紗錠五十萬枚，布機五千台，非不可能。不幸七七事變，遂成全國作戰之局，華商工廠多在淪陷區域，或遭轟炸，或受摧殘，或被强佔；其能倖免苟存者，不過今日上海租界內之六十四萬紗綻，四千六百合布機，及「自由中國」之十四尤紗錠，小數布機而已。</p>
<p>戰事爆發後，政府力令沿海各省工廠　往後方繼續生產，乃以事出倉猝，旣無充分　　，復因種種顧慮，徘徊觀望，未能果行，會義何時，我國紗廠集中區如天津，濟南，靑島，太原，上海，無錫，常州，漢口等地，相繼淪陷。其眞能遷入後方者，不過紗錠十萬枚；布機數百台耳。興念及此，能不黯然。</p>
<p>查華商紡織廠在淪陷區或遭損毀或被侵佔者，有如下表：單位一錘一台）</p>
<p>在華之日商紡織廠因戰事而遭損毀者，雖有紗錠八十二尤枚，而機一尤五千台灣，但如按左表之比較，則其喧賓奪主之勢，面不難一目瞭然也。</p>
<p>戰前戰後在華紗錠布機比較表（均以究所統計月刊內一文而成者。其中應注意者有三點：（一）戰前之紗錠及布機數，係指運轉中及擬添設者之和；（二）戰後係指民國十八年五月間之情形；括弧內數字指實際運轉中之錠數及台數；（二）戰後之日廠包括所謂「軍管理」及「受任經營」之被侵佔華廠在內，其企圖壟斷之情　形昭彰矣。</p>
<p>如就前表用百分率表明之，則得下表：</p>
<p>上海之紡織廠</p>
<p>據去年五月中旬上海日本紡織聯合　調查公佈之數字，淪陷區內被侵佔管理而開工者有三十二廠；華中部份有二十二廠，所開紗錠爲四八三、七四一枚（佔原錠數白分之八十一），所開布機爲三、七二二台（佔原機數百分之六十五）。要言之，損壞機器之修理，需費頗鉅，而原棉之供給不暢（華北允甚），且銷路日見壅阻，遂使日商未能充分利用其所接管之華廠而生產也。</p>
<p>更據前年五月日方調查，八一三滬戰時，京滬區域內華廠之被燬於砲火者有紗錠五十萬枚，布機三千台。雖事後遷入租界之華廠讀有增添擴充，仍不逮戰前遠甚。據日方聲稱，運轉中之紗錠及布機，華中部份僅及戰前百分之七十，華北部份僅及戰前百分之七十五，故生產量亦隨之遽减，華中月產棉紗十二萬件，（內日廠佔半數以上），華北不過月產四萬件（幾全日廠出品）而已。此項出品，大都銷售於當地或　近區域，而以京滬，滬杭，津浦三綫及長江流域爲最盛。</p>
<p>經濟專刊　第三六六期</p>
<p>後方缺乏紡織生產機關，紗布向感供不應求。軍興以來，政府內遷，軍民衣被所需，爲數更巨。仰供於內地三十四萬紗錠及小數布機，其窘絀情形顯而易見。近年來政府提倡手工，紡織業，鼓勵增加土紗布生產，復經技術家悉心研究，改良手工紡紗機，從事推廣，但產量仍與需求相差遠甚。故後方紗布之供給，仍不得不恃諸上海或國外。而上海倖存之華商紗廠及英廠，遂成大之　子，大發其國難財，利潤之厚，有非常人所能相像者。</p>
<p>上海現有紡織廠之開工情形，列表如左（單位枚台）</p>
<p>廠名　現開紗錠數　現開布機數</p>
<p>A　國人自辦及有外南關係之華廠</p>
<p>國運生死存亡之秋，竟爲廠商造成千戰一時之黃金機會。，以與二十餘年前歐戰時盈利相比，誠有不可以道里計者，昔之盈餘二一百萬元者已屬不易，今時一二千萬元視爲當然。言念及此，能不駭然，華廠盈餘支配，向無公開報吿。惟聞擁有紗錠萬教之紗廠，獲利在百萬元以上者，比比皆是，則紗錠愈多，盈利愈厚，可概見焉。茲據報紙所載姑舉三實例如左，以供參考。</p>
<p>A　上海紡織廠（日商）</p>
<p>該廠資本爲一千二百萬元，運轉紗錠爲一五二、二六〇枚，布　爲二、五八八臺。一九四〇年度全年盈和爲二二、一八力、七七五。六三元，約合資本額百分之一八五。其上下半年度計算如次：</p>
<p>B　統益紡織廠（華商而有英商關係者）</p>
<p>該廠資本原爲一百七十萬元，戰後迭將紅利升股而增資至二百九十七萬元。運轉紗錠爲五七、八〇八枚，布機爲三〇〇臺。近三年來盈利比較如决：（決算期均爲每年十二月卅一日）</p>
<p>去年盈利數，三倍於其資本　額，誠屬驚人。更有可注意者，則去年度上海各廠盈餘，大都爲其有史以來之最高紀漢。　以一空　絕後」四字，允可受之無愧乎？</p>

<h3>南北貸　桂圓市貸仍旺</h3>
<p>桂圓爲普通補品之一、頗寓有大衆化性質，查去年因某方封鎖海口關係曾斷檔多時、後有人多方設法、改由航船裝運到厦、轉輪運滬、於是造成最高之價格、嗣後輪運復通、到貨漸增、今春因去化至呆、開盤不及頂價之牛、但本市鬥售均圖厚利、大都未肯隨開盤削低、是爲憾事、嗣興化泉州輪運復阻、市價本有轉榮可能、無如供過於求狀態、依然存在、是以產價與申市迄未脫離背馳異象云、</p>
<h3>粉乾突飛猛晋</h3>
<p>綫粉乾因產價昂、而到存均稀、價乃突飛猛進、前後漲起三四十元之多、昨龍口粉售二百六十元、靑島粉二百二十元　江北粉一百七十元實爲空前之高價、且此物爲蒸荳所製、與雜糧有連帶關係也、</p>
<h3>桃肉漸向下游</h3>

<h3>藥材　百合片久乏到貸</h3>

<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子實銷不減</h3>
<p>黑鐵坯子趨勢　昂已久、蓋一般廠家對之高等原料（如馬口鐵會司鐵等）、因價格昂責、無法採辦、在可能範圍內、改用决等原料之黑鐵坯子、是貨頗受本街機器廠鏡子廠以及熱水瓶廠製罐廠等歡迎、故連日成交堪稱不寂、惟目前海外已無來源、而本市所存究屬有限、業中人心思十分堅强、大有不肯輕易脫手之感、昨市喊價每扎二千磅、須三千二百元、行情較之前市雖無多大上落、然暗盤則在步步趨緊中、</p>
<h3>美狹條鐵步昂</h3>
<p>美狹條鐵乃會司鐵之决號貨、廠家之需要額量、僅决於黑鐵坯子、因其標準亦相寓低廉故也、目前更因馬口鐵會司鐵之飛漲、（刻市馬口鐵每箱售五百元、老鋼廠會司鐵沾四百元、新鋼廠會司貨亦關三百九十元、）故如玩具廠香烟廠以及印刷廠等採辦是貨、允見急切、且流通貨不多、　執貨者人心挺秀、開價步步高昂、昨每二百磅沽三百二十元、比前漲起達十元光景、</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟供求兩懈</h3>

<p>看到聽到想到</p>
<p>現鈔要對劃頭票貼水，這是銀錢業票據，迫害國家貨幣的一逆倫」現象。</p>
<p>據說「這是中中交三行停止供給劃頭的結果」。然則三行停供劃頭，無碍劃頭供給總量的多寡。因爲劃頭供給總量的多寡，實決定於商業銀行。</p>
<p>又聞「銀行常以「祗解現鈔」作淤票理由二銀錢兩業準備庫，又以除息方法，降低同業　庫的餘額。因之現鈔供過於求，劃頭變成奇貨可居」云云。是則「獎勵人民節儲」「提高銀行存息」等電令，又不知何解？</p>
<p>如果放任這類「逆倫」現象存在，那末可以預料到的後果，不是別的，而是（一）替一般銀號錢莊造成吸收現鈔的機會，開闢資金的來源。他們可以在經營支票業務中，「無本開店」，並擴大其投機的可能。（二）造成銀號錢莊的劃頭票氾濫時代，因爲要避免現鈔貼水的損失，必羣趨四川路開立支票往來戶。</p>
<p>若因本市美商銀行停做美金支票戶的結果，使美滙投機受到束縛；便以爲中國的銀行家收縮支票業務，也可遏制投機；這實在是滑大下之大稽的邏輯。</p>
<p>要消滅這種「逆倫」現象，事極簡單；只要（一）提高銀錢業存息，同時降低往來息，（二）不要再以「祗解現鈔」作退票理由。（三）銀錢兩業的準備庫，應即實放起息的同業存款餘額的限度。</p>
<p>要使「提高存息」不致成爲紙上談兵，莫如由國家負担銀錢業因加息而所增的負担，對於　業準備庫的存款餘額之給息，也可照樣辦理。不過在保息制度下，應附以查賬的條件，以杜流弊，</p>
<p>以「祇解現鈔」作爲退票理由，這是銀行職員自行延長「假期」的手段。各行當局很易整頓。</p>
<p>降低往來息，可以减輕投機者利用支票的活動機能。聽說中中交三行現已充分收受現鈔，所以現鈔貼水業已壓低。此於通貨收縮政策上，倒已發生了「意想不到的效力」。</p>

<h3>納稅特會定期舉行　局方作妥慎佈置　對會場內外有嚴密戒備　工董變更後一切即改觀</h3>
<p>納稅外人持別大會及年會、已決定於四月十七日（星期四）下午二時半起、在靜安寺路跑馬總會公共看臺先後舉行、日來工部局工務處止積極佈置會場、搭架蘆席棚、以便風雨無阻、準時舉行、其佈置或仍將與重開支納稅特會（今年二月五日）情形相同、主席臺與納稅人席完全隔開、以防意外、同時為策安全起見、開會時將出警務處派大批各國際探補、在會場內特別戒備、會場入口處把守尤嚴、除執有選舉票之納稅外人及有特別派司之新聞記者外、非經特必然許可、一概不准入場、眾信此次納稅特會擠年會之舉行、與今年一月二十三日之納稅特會性質完全不同、故不致發生意外事變、</p>
<p>一致重視　華董問題</p>
<p>對於今年工董選舉之特殊情形、華人方面所全神注意者、厥為華董問題、因現任華董處洽卿·袁履登·陳　銳·奚玉書·郭順·等五人、華委劉世芳·徐曉初·徐冠群·金通尹·趙傅鼎·李文杰·六人以及地產委員金宗城等、</p>
<p>早經現狀之納稅華人會推定蟬聯、並經工部局正是備文承認在案、但根據新比率華董突減至四人、各方對此種變化、雖寄以重視、但現任華董·華委·等、均嚴守緘默、不發一言、記者昨曾電詢現仍留滬之花董袁雁登及奚玉書等、但兩氏對此問題、均拒絕發表任何意見、</p>
<p>各國僑民　成立妥協</p>
<p>外籍經籍學專家阿勒斯、昨日再英文大美周報發表評論云、公共租界納稅人、將於下星期四（十七日）舉行大會、屆時對英·美·日·德·荷·瑞·各國僑民間所成立之妥協、或將投票通過、即將以工董十六名（包括華董四名）之臨時董事會以代現下之工部局董事會、此種妥協、若獲通過、在不論任何國際之市民、除業經推出之候選人外、似不致另推額外候選人、故無論選舉舉行與否、此十六名「臨時工董」殆已決定為新工部局之董事矣、東方有一古諺、大意謂「機車難返」、</p>
<p>臨時辦法　殆將永久</p>
<p>日人認為臨時董事會僅係暫時性質組織、但目下之局勢一日不終止、則工部局之董事會一日不能恢復正常之狀態、為時既久、則此種臨時辦法、恐將垂於永久、同時、向以英美籍董事為多數之工部局、恐難恢復舊狀矣、造成此種「臨時董事會」之妥協、其談判內幕、一經洩露、則公眾當能覺察、在談判過程中、其目的在使現狀儘量遷延、「臨時董事會」對各國董事名額之分配、雖不能謂達於理想之標準、但亦可視為不得上、僅求其次、　當時若非美僑之堅持、則董事會之組織、將更形不堪、關於「臨時董事會」之人選問題、吾人自無所　　、蓋彼等皆係久居上海而　有地位之人士、對於工董之位置、自無不合之處、</p>
<p>期望注意　羣眾利益</p>

<h3>密查囤米棧址　決將限令出售</h3>
<p>業外商人囤米查明懲治　休假期內洋米成交極夥</p>
<p>兩租界當局自積極設法穩定米市後、業已漸見成效、惟一般投機、仍在活動、以致整個米業市況條松條緊、國洋米價　難　於下落、升斗平民、及薪水階級者、不無遭受嚴重威脅、兩當局為速謀解除平民倒懸、及確保社會治安、並未標本兼施起見、刻在分別調查囤米者真實姓名、及其囤積數額、一俟調查竣事、即將飭令各該米囤戶、閒氣將囤貨吐脫市場、否則即作囤積局奇論、予以依法究辦、藉以穩定民食、</p>
<p>希望檢舉</p>
<p>又據另一方面透露消息、兩當局為期徹底明瞭米糧囤積數額起見、除已派員分頭密查外、並恐視聽未周、未克盡書、故猶盼全市居民向兩當局檢舉告密、分　囤米者真實姓名、　囤米數額、　囤米確切棧址、當局待接獲該項檢舉函件後、即派員按址密查、倘查得確有其事者、即將入冊備查、至於米商用車輪搬運國洋米糧、事前均須向各該當局報告、或領發搬運證、凡路途上遇警探檢查時、須出示該　搬運證、其　即在防杜私運米糧、</p>
<p>懲治囤戶</p>
<p>記者又獲得確切之消息稱、兩當局鑒於米市場現貨籌碼缺乏、即因大宗洋米　不出棧所致、若不亟予取締、米市前途將愈不堪設想、惟米糧之被人操縱、資金充厚之業外投機商人、亦難辭其咎、今當局已具決心、甫在積極籌劃外商人囤米懲治辦法、凡有陽奉陰違、膽敢掩飾者、一俟查出、即予嚴懲不貸、茲盼業外商人迅將囤米脫手、勿再執迷不悟、</p>
<p>洋米來源</p>
<p>報戰泰國政府將實行統治食米、規定凡出口米糧、須向泰國政府領得執照後、方準起運、但本市米糧來源、十分之六以上、來自越南、由泰國運滬之米糧、在去年僅占總輸入百分之二五·七、至本年二月份、洋米總輸入為四十七萬包、而泰國米僅占二萬餘包、故泰國米之運滬總數、已降至百分之二、此次泰政府之實施統治食米出口、與本部米市之影響甚少、日泰政府僅係對食米出口加以統治、並非禁止出口、故本市米商、現仍可照常訂購泰米也、</p>
<p>上周到額</p>
<p>昨具米業界消息、上周間因外匯鬆弛、洋米產價低落、一般正當米商、咸為未雨綢繆計、分頭委諸各洋行代電海外產米區訂購鉅額洋米、該項米糧、今甫在雇輪裝載中、不久即可抵達此間、惟上月中間所成交之大宗西貢仰光洋米、今已相繼運滬、據悉上周間共計運抵洋米達十萬包以上、該項洋米、除供諸市民按日購　外、尚有三四萬包進棧儲藏、故在斯到源涌旺、存底充沛聲中、米價竟猶步步上升、殊屬駭異、若無米蟲作祟、何至於此、</p>
<p>今日復市</p>
<p>關於本市民食前途、自兩租界當局採取嚴峻措施、設法穩定以還、一般市民聞之咸頗表示欣喜、惟民食前途在投機把持之下、殊難臆測、又米市場自於本月十一日起掃墓節循例休假二天後、按此三日內運抵洋米及成交者、為數可觀、故今日米市開做後、預料現貨將增多、</p>
<h3>杭州灣黑夜橫渡　帆船失事詳記　淹斃乘客一百四十餘人　家屬痛苦尋屍悲慘欲絕</h3>
<p>滬浙海上交通、自被日方擴大封鎖後、滬浙間行旅、頗有冒險橫渡杭州灣往來者、該處交通、距離水程達三百餘華里、平時浪急潮高、而渡江工具、祗籍懸掛風蓬之舊式小帆船、禦風疾馳、險象環生、本月九日凌晨、遂發生空前慘劇、遭覆舟淹斃隸甯波籍及其他籍之旅客、總數達一百四十餘人、生還者祗四十餘名、出事地點、在接壤滬郊之奉賢縣境、地名金山嘴、自滬乘汽車、半小時可達、者以此事極為嚴重、爰赴出事地點調查、親見陳屍江濱之淒涼慘景、茲錄各情於後、</p>
<p>小舟橫渡三百餘里</p>
<p>杭州灣橫渡之起終點、為浙境余姚縣屬之庵東鎮、及蘇境奉賢縣屬之漕涇鎮、（即張家厙、又有南厙北厙之分、）起終點係橫越杭州灣、水程相距三百餘華里、風浪甚急、渡江所籍、為一種懸掛風蓬之帆船、俗名　巴船、往來盡籍風力、遇順風急潮時、三百餘華里水程、僅三四小時可到達、如風不順、或值落潮擱船時、則輒有長時間之停留、俗名　舟、自滬浙海上交通阻斷後、該處已為行旅冒險往返之所、</p>
<p>風急潮涌　黑夜失事</p>
<p>九日凌晨、在金山嘴覆舟之艫巴船老大、年約四十餘歲、係庵東人、雇有船夥三名、係獨枝桅杆懸蓬、故船體並不甚大、於本月八日晚十時、自庵東開出、載有旅客二百餘名、船內擠塞、達於極點、是晚因南風甚急、船行極速、該船之最終目的、係駛至祗離張家厙九里之金山嘴海面、（按即八一三日軍登陸處、當時風急潮湧、船身又載重逾量、船老大及船夥、其時已認為危機急迫、故不及駛抵張家厙、將船向金山嘴沿岸泥灘猛衝、希冀衝上泥灘、以解危急、</p>
<p>空前慘劇　頃刻發生</p>
<p>惟金山嘴沿岸泥塗甚闊、攔船之處、距岸尚有二三里距離、是處海水、深可及腰、其時船老大自知船體即將爆裂、因大聲疾呼、飭旅客離船上灘、惟時當黑夜、何方是岸、何方是海、乘客在倉皇之中、如何辨別、即使向上灘一面跨出、水深尚及腰際、如非略識水性、亦難立足舉步、於是空前慘劇、遂演成矣、是役步上泥灘登岸生還者、祗四十餘人、淹斃灘上者、達九十餘人、向外跨落海屍體、尚未撈獲者、亦四五十名、</p>
<p>撈起屍體　多數赤裸</p>
<p>失事後、霎時人聲鼎沸、該處居民、相率驚起、詢悉所以、並引導出險旅客各止後、其時天已發亮、始再打撈屍體、惟當地居民、智識比較淺薄、見屍體衣服華麗、及身畔藏有錢鈔者、均被剝取、並將袋割破、故撈起屍體、以赤裸及衣服不完者居多數、迄昨日止、已撈獲一百名左右、上項屍體、均由當地熱心人士如李喜鳴（開森泰雜貨號）等設法、雇工在村後半里許之塔基地方、掘兩泥坑、將撈起之屍體、挨次排比、陳於坑內、上蓋蘆席、以憑家屬認領、</p>
<p>家屬尋屍　一片哭聲</p>
<p>大通社記者得訊後、昨晨驅車至閔行渡江、經西渡·蕭塘·南橋·西新市·柘林·漕涇·至金山嘴·半日即達·即分訪就地李喜鳴等、並親赴陳屍地點視察、上項屍體、大都均係自甯波（占十分之六七）·紹興·及其他籍（占十分之三四）來滬者、滬上家屬、前往認領者絡繹、嚎哭之聲不絕、約有十分之四、經認領後就地厝葬、有現居虹口之唐山路五福里五十三號之甯波人張林寶之妻、亦在認屍、因其母李氏（年五十二歲）子華強（五歲）、及同村人勵品和妻某氏（年二十八歲）子三歲、李桂芳之母（年五十三歲）·李金福（年六十六歲）·孫二人（一八歲一六歲）·李來發妻（廿三歲）·子（四歲）·弟（六歲）·李三壬（年五十餘歲婦人）·周阿大（年五十餘歲婦人）·託一同業撐船之勵蕓卿、挈帶來滬、亦自庵東乘該船來滬、除勵蕓卿逃生外、其他諸人、全部死難、由該勵蕓卿通知滬上家屬後、赴金山嘴尋屍、祗將子華強屍尋獲、其他實體無着、</p>
<p>責任所在　應加嚴究</p>
<p>又據該掏出之勵蕓卿言、當庵東開船之前、渠係耽擱於庵東亞東旅館、向旅館主張某、介紹至大路門伴送人鐘某處購船票、每名索船費十五元、其他旅客、大都亦有伴送人送至該帆船、當時勵某曾向該鐘姓伴送人言、人多恐帆船不能容載、而鐘姓答謂、有帆船兩只分載、迨抵上船處、則帆船祗有一艘、伴送人於船老大、殊有互相勾結之嫌、又該帆船失事後、隨即分裂、飄散無蹤、</p>

<h3>水木業工潮未弭平　罷工者萬餘人　工人十餘名昨被捕即釋　甯波搬場汽車工潮解決</h3>
<p>水木業工人近年來因生活困難、廠力曾經於上年增加工資兩次、本年因物價又復高漲、經工人代表之要求、山水木業職業工會與工友多次商討、並經廠方開問業大會、　決再行增加工資、木作九角、連前共一元九角、水作八角、連前共一元七角半（計加百分之九十）、另供飯食、由營造廠商同業公會登報公告、於本月十六日起一律增加、不料工人未盡明瞭、仍有停工行動、各營造廠紛紛向該業公會報告、該會以加資問題、既已由水木業職業公會解決於前、應由該職業工會負責消弭、以息糾紛、</p>
<p>水木工人全部停業</p>
<p>水木工人前日罷工後、參加罷工後、參加罷工之人數、原達六千餘、但尚有一部份作場、工人並未停業、致為罷工工人不滿、昨晨乃分頭前往工概念股租界及法租界各作場、要求參加罷工、一時會發生爭執、致罷工工人、曾在法租界被捕房捕去十餘名、旋於午前十一時許釋出、因此昨日二三區（即公共租界法租界）亦全部加入罷工、迄今罷工共計一萬餘人、並悉昨晨該業勞資、本定商討辦法、但未成功、</p>
<p>搬場公司資方態度</p>
<p>茂泰·中國·太平·甯波·永安·上天等搬場公司全體司機小工　一千餘人、因要求增加工資未遂、於本月六日發生工潮後、資方迄今仍無確切表示、致糾紛僵化、茲悉司機工會方面、由孫連山·劉永福·徐項撐等三人、會同資方運貨業公會會長樓銀川、數度談判後、於昨日下午五時、將甯波搬場汽車公司工潮解決、資方接受之主要條件如下、　每月增加米津貼國幣三十元　罷工期內工資賄給、至其他勞方所提各項細則、亦經資方予以接受、故該公司可於今明日內復工、其他公司資方、因對是項協定條件尚在考慮、故一時難獲解決、</p>
<p>商務爭執調解束手</p>
<p>商務印書館全體同人、因迫於生計、不得已請求總經理王雲五氏、要求酌予增薪律、俾資維持、但該項要求、迄未邀準、故全體同人、情緒頗為憤激、復於十二日中午致電王總經理、並限五天答覆、茲錄其原電如下、「十一日五點半、召開會員大會、羣情激昂、通過授權執會、限五日內請總經理自四月份起、依舊最低工資率原則頒佈辦法、否則全體同人、誓作生死之爭、雲公囑晚勸同人、我意反之、請願全事實、同人生活水火、形同難民、此公司之恥、平衡米貼義狭、百物無貼、雲公明知、自欺良心、同人固苦、公司豐福、趙良」、</p>

<h3>傳法水兵三名潛逃投效自由法軍　愛高被捕認為與此有關</h3>
<p>本埠著督法僑領袖愛高、自本月五日突被駐滬法國海軍當局逮捕後、迄已多日、現愛氏仍被　押於法砲艦賈爾業愛號上、平明社記者茲據向消息靈通之法僑方面探悉、當愛高未被逮捕之前、駐泊於黃浦江中之法艦賈爾業愛號上、有法國水兵三名、突由滬來輪赴港、轉赴星家坡、加入自由法軍、法海軍當局、認該三名水兵之「叛變」、為愛高所協助、故乃將逮捕</p>
<p>五人投效</p>
<p>自特哥爾將軍在倫敦組織自由法軍、繼續與英軍合作、對德義作戰以來、本埠法僑陸續離滬投效、茲據本埠法國僑民方面所得可靠消息、旅滬法僑五名、近　離滬赴港、投效自由法軍、該五法、前均會充本埠法警務處警官之職、其中二名乃生長於上海者、此事　生於本月月初、惟於前日已安抵香港矣、</p>
<p>擁護日眾</p>
<p>該五法僑此次離滬赴港、投效自由法軍、事頗曲折、蓋五法僑於決會參加自由法國運動後、先由法租界避入公共租界、向本埠英領署缺德證明書、始行登輪赴港、不久即將由自由法國運動香港分會協助、再赴他處入伍、以償其志願、並悉日前旅滬法僑中、什九咸擁護特哥爾將軍、</p>

<h3>南市之行</h3>
<p>— 楊堤</p>
<p>耶穌復活節，俗稱外國清明；前一週為聖主日，又稱為大主日。第一日為聖枝主日（或稱棕爛口），是紀念民眾持著青枝，高呼萬歲，歡迎耶穌榮，耶路撒冷聖城的事跡；這一日教堂裏念瑪　寫的難始末。第一日念瑪爾谷寫的受難始末；第四日年路加寫的受難始末；第五日紀念耶穌建立聖體，鐘鈴靜默兩天餘，表示哀思。第六日年一一畏怯往往是唱一一若望寫的受難始末。第七日是復活前夕，亦稱望復活了。在這一週間各教堂特別忙，神職人員，往往全體出動。由惠屯教祝聖聖油，著祭服參加曲禮的司　與修士，多至數十人、歷三四小時之久。每座聖堂中，於另一個角落裏，搭一座新祭臺，極盡裝飾、能事供聖體一日一夜，燈燭輝煌，拜聖體的人川流不息，本市教友之往徐家匯，當以這一天為最多；車水馬龍，盛極一時。</p>
<p>第五日下午起，我由徐家匯被分派到南市董家渡天主堂幫忙兩天。這是我於八一三以後第二次做南市之行。第一次是去年冬天吧，爲了　內老堂三百週紀念，想寫一篇文章，故去作一次實地的考察，結果大失所望，碑文古跡，一概勿存。文章頁因此未作。該堂范司鐸　出紀念冊，因種種關係，亦未果。記得那是細雨霏霏之日，與同學錢君在斷垣殘壁中彳亍，益　淒涼！</p>
<p>第一次是今年二三月間，到聖墓堂去送葬。聖墓堂埋葬著明·清以來在上海逝世的中西耶穌會士，清代名畫家吳漁山與去年逝世的徐文定公後裔允希司鐸，他們的軀殼都在那兒長眠著。</p>
<p>聖墓堂是在民國路附近。正修中學與新普育堂也在那兒。正修中學有他光榮的歷史，全國國貨展覽會與公教進行會，代表大會都是作那兒舉行的。公進會開會的時候，我曾去聽過幾次講演。現在弄得不像樣子了。</p>
<p>那一天順便到了新普育堂參觀，由范姆姆招待，她對於慷慨解囊的慈善家，頗致謝意；尤其對於登高呼樂善好施的呂·鄧·二位先生，表示謝意。</p>
<p>呂先生之為人，我前已得知。呂先生是我的同鄉，我自己也因此引為莫大的榮幸。前天我到南市之先，曾順便造其辦公處訪問，雖是初次見面卻一見如故，作了四五十分鐘的談話，曾設計一些宗教問題，他很欽佩修女們服務的精神·我於當面道謝外，現在更一至誠，敬視呂·鄧·二位先生以及一切當仁不讓與見義勇為「仁者壽」與「為善最榮」！</p>
<p>董家渡天主堂具有悠久的歷史，是江南教士避暑與僻靜之地。戰前擁有六七千極熱心的教友，現在回歸故園的，只有六七分之一。</p>
<p>我在這古老的董家渡堂寄宿了兩夜，將近月半的月亮，被模糊的薄霧所籠罩著，好似是在哭泣，愁眉不展。夜裏很靜，陰沉得可怕！</p>
<p>昨日早晨，宗教儀式完畢後。由同學沈君領導，憑　附近的斷垣殘壁。沈君是董家渡人，他指點成堆的瓦礫和碎磚對我說：這是某某同學底家，那是某某同學底家；他自己的家也在內，有幾個衣衫襤褸的孩子在遺址上從事發掘。</p>
<p>在這樣的地點來度過耶穌難節，來讀耶穌米先知底哀歌，「撫今追昔，感慨　之」！</p>
<p>今天上午，我和同學錢君到黃浦江邊和民國路上去散步了兩小時。古時上說：「國破山河在，城春草木深」，現在雖是早春天氣，而散步時未見一點綠意；這是因為破磚碎瓦堆積得太深，草木也無法插腳了！不然的話，三四年來蔓草荒烟，梧桐該有數丈之高了！</p>
<p>和第二次到南市一樣，今天也到新普育堂去參觀過，並且購了一點難　的手工品，「貨真價廉」上海當推它為第一家，這真是值得向大眾介紹的。</p>
<p>昨日申報載：「新普育堂捐款，愈見踴躍」，令人星峰異常。不過在這米珠薪桂之今日，電燈自來水等，無意不需高貴的代價，要維持數百難童底生活，的確不是容易的事。所以捐款是「多多益善」。我也樂意代他們作將伯之呼。</p>
<p>記得四年前之今日，讀蔣委員長「耶穌受難給予吾人之教訓」，也是數位同事領先入教之日。耶穌受難給予吾人的教訓是極有意義的；南市之行所得印象是極深刻的。</p>
<p>耶穌復活石中華民族復興的象徵。亞助路亞！</p>

<h3>修學講座　怎樣研究國文（四）</h3>
<p>— 薛無競</p>
<p>（乙）了解程度有深淺、文字有難易、可是我們唯一的標準、不務虛名、只求實際、大概研究國文的人、最初發動的興趣、都是從小說入手、小說的魔力、的確很大、記得有一篇文章是論小說與　治之關係道「小說之支配入道也、一日熏、二日浸、三日刺、四日提、」所以凡讀小說的人、無不津津有味、文思日進、再進而讀其他的書籍、自然迎刃而解、事半功倍了</p>
<p>（丙）應用　吃飯的人、貴能消化、營養全身、讀書的人、貴能融化、貫通腦海、科舉時代、詩云子曰、鬧得烏煙瘴氣、恍如鸚鵡學語、當然要受著時代的淘汰、我們生在現代、讀一字要求其音義的了解、讀一句要求其句法的變化、讀一篇要明其章情·說理·各有體裁、詩詞·歌曲·聯語·祭文·各有格式、稍等錯誤、摹擬、神而明之、大而化之、那就出面問世、無扞格不通之虞了</p>
<p>（三）應閱的種類、梁任公寫到一個國學書目、胡適之也開了一人　的帳單、都是包羅萬象、應有盡有、不要說是中學生讀不完、就是大學國文系的學生、也有點兒頭痛、這是寫來裝裝門面、嚇嚇一般的人罷了、我友阮樂真、曾有專名、以批評、我這裏不在詳徵博引、拾人牙慧、但覺應閱的種類、除依上述三標準之外、當斟酌的生的程度、按照年齡的大小、依著時代的先後、輕重緩急、分精讀和略讀兩種、把古今第一二流的名著、合時代的需要、國家的期望、羅致的不妨多、抉擇的務要嚴、按期順序閱讀自然會不嚴等、不貪多、向養成好學深思、手不釋卷的習慣了、所訂書目、另有專文討論、茲不具引、</p>
<p>（四）閱讀應注意之點、曾文正論其子記澤書云、讀書之法、看讀寫作、四者不可缺一、……醫之富家居積、看書則在外貿易、獲利三倍者也、讀書則在家慎守、不輕花費者也、醫之兵家戰爭、看書則攻城爭地、開拓土宇者也、讀書則深溝壁壘、的地能守者也]可知閱與讀、應分兩事、然而時代不同、有可注意者如下、</p>
<p>（甲）閱　博覽　記憶　摘錄　卡片</p>
<p>（乙）讀　默寫　背書　朗誦　吟哦</p>
<p>右面所述、雖已綱舉目張、一望而知、然而除博覽·記憶·默寫·背書·無多大推敲之外、其他四點、不得不加申述、</p>

<h3>食話</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>維也納大學敎授高特烈博士曾謂，據其經騐所得，確有多種蔬菜及魚類可以治療牙病；蔬菜之中，允以白菜，菠菜，因富於石灰質，最有益於齒牙。</p>
<p>若進食特限一個人僅用以支局其生命的最少食物量，體重可以囚之减低。哥倫比亞大學敎授某，曾發明一種測騐一個人最少食物量的機器，測得分量後，即作爲食物的標準，不過食，不少食，則體重即能减輕，女生試之，成效卓著。</p>
<p>味覺與高度有密切的關係，據會往喜馬拉雅山探險的探險隊報吿，謂升至一萬九千呎高之地點時，味覺便完全失去，雖食大葱與辣椒，亦不覺其何味。</p>
<p>向來　動家在練習期內，多忌食糖品，但據波士頓哥登博士等著名醫生實騐結果，證明糖類食品不但對運動無碍，而且有益。賽跑者若先飲甜糖茶，並食廿豆餅多枚，可以精神倍出，取其血液檢查，疲乏程度，不如未食糖而跑者之甚。</p>
<p>多飲鹽水，可以耐熱，因熱度過高，身上蒸發多量鹽分，飲鹽水所以補足之。美國科學會曾以此法命在隧道中工作的鑛工行之，果能在飲鹽水後忍耐酷熱。</p>
<h3>破襪做書包</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>關於破襪的廢物利用，本刊曾有過不少硏究的文字發表。但破襪可以做書包的一種利用，還沒有人說過。因此，就筆者所知道的，想一說破襪做書包的過程。</p>
<p>目前一般學生，允其是女學生所拿的紗條編成的書包，大半是用破襪做成功的。我們穿過的破襪，可以由統子口橫剪下去，剪到了底，成一長條，然後用水漂乾凈了，再染上各種顏色，就可以編成書包。小巧玲瓏，非常好看，誰會知道是拿破襪來做成的呢。</p>
<p>破襪做書包的歷史，大概還不到三年；據我所知道的，最初由難民習藝所首先利用破襪，編成了書包，向各校發售，從此才一年年的風行起來。到現在甚至有人開了廠，專門在用破襪來做書包了。</p>
<p>這種工廠，破襪的來路大致有三處。（一）拾垃圾的人從垃圾桶裏拾來；（二）換糖的人把糖換來。，（三）人家直接把破襪積起來賣給他們。照目前的市價，一斤破襪，大槪可售五角。</p>
<p>書包廠把破襪收了下來，編成書包之後，每隻可批叫角。所以到百貨店或文具店去買一隻書包，就要五六角了。剪襪相編織的工作是由女工做的。剪一斤破襪，代價祗一角，而編織成一隻書包，祗有二分工資。不過熟手的女工，一天也可賺到一元左右工資。</p>
<p>破機做成的書包，不但由學生購用，目　一般上小菜塲的娘兒姐兒，也每歡喜用這種書包來代替菜籃。因爲買了東西，放在裏面，不容易被小偷搶去。所以書包的銷路相當好。這種新興事業正在開始發展；你想經營一所書包工廠，集資三二千元，就司開廠工作，這倒是一種小資本的工業，而很容易發展的啊！</p>
<h3>苞米粉的煮食法</h3>
<p>— 何立三</p>
<p>「苞米」，一名「玉蜀黍」，江南人叫做「珍珠米」，浙江省的人，叫做「六谷」，這是因各處方言而異的。這樣東西，本來是一種粗糲的食品，凡是鄕間貧戶，多把它來充作食料，或作爲飼鷄之用，至於城市的人，可說是很少嘗過它的滋味。自上海米價在漲到一百元以外，於是這苞米也應運而起，漸漸流行到都市裏，佔着食糧中的一席。據日前本報「經濟新聞』載：近糧食商苞米拋出有七八十萬包，足見行銷之廣，嗣因囤戶囤積吸進，其價已自三角七分，漲到四角多。不過煮食的方法，想來懂得的還很少，最近在下承三友實業社主人送來六谷粉一大包，經過多决的煮食，現在把經騐所得，特地記述出來，以投本刋，藉供住戶購食者的採擇。（一）和粥煮食，在煮粥將好的時候，將六谷粉和入，的三四成，用筷隨滲隨攪，滾透即可起鍋，如喜食甜，可加些糖，如與飯同煮亦可，在煮飯將好時加入，不過和入一二成已足，不可太多。（二）調成糊狀而食，先將水燒滾，即以六谷粉倒入，隨滲隨攪，使不致凝結成塊，滾沙即成糊狀，加糖食。（三）做成麵疙瘩食，先用鍋將湯加料煮滾，加入油菜蝦米或鹹菜之類，另用六谷粉，以冷水調和，須稍厚，不可過薄，如加入麵粉亦可，即用筷將粉夾起，隨夾隨滲入鍋中，便成麵疙瘩，煮熟即起。（四）煎食法，將粉用冷水調和，加糖，人豆油鍋中，徐徐炸煎，先用筷攪，决用剷刀四面攤成蛋皮狀，煎至黃　色取起，味頗可口，大有鷄蛋滋味，如加入麵粉同攪和亦可。以上幾種食法，都很簡便，而且這紛的功用，能補中益氣，健脾耐飢，現在米價貴到如此地步，把它米佐餐，正是又經濟，又衛生，大家在此非常時期，是應該値得提倡的。</p>
<h3>再談醬油與胃病</h3>
<p>— 靑驄</p>
<p>白馬先生讀拙着「醬油與胃病」稿後，以爲「頗多異乎吾即之處」，遂有一醬油可治胃病」之指敎。然細繹所論，與拙稿似相符合，無多出入處。並引徐卓呆先生「醬油經假醬油之語，說明不良之醬油，實於衛生不合，與僕言蓋同。拙着祇稱醬油之爲調味粉棄渣殘液所製成以及化學醬油如果配製不合，以致鹽酸過剩，未變中和性者，易致胃臟諸疾，固非謂化學醬油之皆有害也。卓呆先生言化學醬油，雖亦用鹽酸提煉，而所用者，爲合成鹽酸，用「鈉」中和後，即無酸性，是亦足與我言相互證合，若果配製不合，鹽酸過剩，未變中和性，則固有碍健康也。白馬先生父謂質地精良之醬油，有滋補力，且可兼治胃病糖尿病脚氣病心臟病等症，而假醬油則不合衛生，有損無益。僕草前文之動機，蓋亦以醬油爲家庭日常要品，而其關係於營養健康者，若是重大，常人不能明共利害，更不知醬油有眞假之別，故筆叩出之，以促主持中饋者，亟應　意，知所選擇耳。僕於此道，未曾涉獵，前文所述，乃得諸恒順醬醋廠李友芳先生，恒順總廠設鎮江，垂九十　，有聲大江南北，所言尚為經驗之談。並參證天虛我生先生所著之家庭實騐常識，先生致力家庭工業，成績卓然，自非紙上談兵者可比，則其論着，亦必信而有徵也。總之，白馬先生之論點，其不同於僕者，僕以不良之醬油，足以釀成胃臟諸疾，而白馬先生，則以精良之醬油，有滋補力，兼可治病，其不合於衛生者，乃假醬油耳。而其主旨，欲人知所鑑別，愼於採用，則一也。</p>
<h3>書畫與居室</h3>
<p>— 紙帳銅瓶室主</p>
<p>書畫足以點綴居室，嚮以丈幅是尚，蓋大氣磅礴，烟雲供養，耐人玩賞無窮，即作者亦覺揮灑自如，不受拘勒。昔東江王大覺索我師石予先生法繪，石予先生嫌楮幅小無用武地，大覺因有爲問乾坤如許大，可能容得幾枝梅一詩爲獻，則其時盛行巨幅可知。海上屋値殊昂，居室什九狹小，於是書畫作風爲之丕變，競尙二三尺之短幅，芥子須彌，於此乃見。吳中之雅擅妙藝，來海上爲寓公者，有張星階朱竹雲，一擅花卉，兼白陽南田之長，一擅山水，得徵仲六如之意，而黃太玄與蔣吟秋允善八法，簡文帝所謂疏密俱巧，眞草皆得，似望城扉，如瞻星石，不營雲飛之散，何待曲辱之丹者，二子有焉。旦所作皆小幅；適合海上居室之需，近日公開展覽於寗波同鄕會四樓，古人顏面，時賢眼孔，眞令人臥遊不盡也。</p>
<p>介紹霍桑探案　程小靑氏所著「霍桑探案」，久已風行海內，現已由世界書局新印袖珍本，（一）珠項圈（二）黃浦江中（三）八十四（四）輪下血（五）裹棉刀（六）恐怖的活劇等六種，各大書局均有出售特爲介紹。</p>
<h3>睡眠</h3>
<p>— 包福星</p>
<p>睡是很重要的，假如你每天睡眠八小時，那末，你的睡眠，就等於你整個生命的三分之一，假如你愛護你自己的生命，應當同樣地寳貴你的陲眠。「人生半世在床上」雖是一句老生常談，却始終不减它那一針見血的警闢性。我們因爲天大睡眠，就不覺到它那不平凡的地方，如束你想嚐嚐睡眠的甜味，容易得很，只要三天不許睡眠好了了。</p>
<p>睡眠的方法很多，我們一般人離不了晚陲晚起早睡早起這兩種，晚睡晚起的人固小慣於早睡早起，早睡早起的人又何嘗慣於晚睡晚起？有人提出一種很　妙的方法：是陲得晚而起得早，爲補充日間的精神，不妨打個午覺。其實不一定打午覺，無論早晚，只耍有空，就可以小睡片刻。我覺得上面這個睡眠方法，很有一試的價値，允其是對於喜歡早起而又愛夜的人。（未完）</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>竹筍究竟是一樣雋品，差不多沒有一個人不愛吃的。就是沒有了牙齒的老太太們，也得揀些嫩筍尖吃吃，至於牙齒良好的人，連一個老筍頭也會嚼得津津有味的。竹筍不比冬筍，價格究竟便宜得多，所以入春以來，每一個家庭餐桌上，總可以見到竹筍的面，好在無論在葷菜素菜中，都可以參加進去。我們常吃的，如竹筍炒肉絲哩，竹筍燉醃鮮哩，竹筍丁紅燒明蝦哩，竹筍拌高　哩，竹筍絲炒枸杞哩，不　而足。還有家製的油燜竹筍，也是下飯下粥的妙品，比了罐頭油燜筍可口得多，這幾天大可嘗試一下。</p>

<h3>我是一個自私殘忍的人</h3>
<p>— 李獄徒</p>
<p>當然，我並不是在說，世界上所有的人，都是自私的東西，但是我敢說，大多數的人，都會有些自私的心理。就拿我自己來說吧，雖然我還不承認我就是世界上最自私的一個，然而已據有了許多自私的特點。譬方說，爲着眼，我會很聰明的找好看的電影或小說給它看。，爲着耳，我會很聰明的找好聽的音樂或歌唱給它聽；爲着嘴，當然的，在一個飯桌上，我會找最好吃的食物往那裏放…總之，我會爲我自己找尋一切的快樂；只要爲我有一點好處的，我半點都不肯放過。</p>
<p>六個月前，因爲對於嘴的過於愛惜，給它吃了太多的東西，生了一個極重的病，於是我這才明白上了自私極大的當，醫生不許我吃一點東西，每大只能喝少許水，肚子裹叫着餓，嘴裏喊着空，九十天的在醬院裹，總有七十五天的晚上做着犬津包于和廣東叉燒的夢。</p>
<p>我的病漸漸的走入了危險的境地，每天總有很多的血順着大便出來，身子一天消瘦了一天，精神一天萎靡了一天，據醫生說：這是漏底傷寒，是一種極嚴重的病症。我急着求他替我醫治，他說：「除先輸血以救急，可暫避免死亡外，別無他法。」我因爲怕死，我因爲自私，我答應了。</p>
<p>第二天，賣血的那個人來了，我一見了他，不覺嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>「他也能賣血麼？這樣瘦的一個人！」我奇怪着的問着看護。</p>
<p>「當然，他賣血，是經通檢查的。」她回答我。</p>
<p>「不，你誤會了我的意思，我知道檢查過的，可是他已經這樣瘦了，再放血他自己不也要病倒了麼？」我終於發生了同情心。</p>
<p>「他肯賣血，那還管他！」這是回答。</p>
<p>賣血的人躺上了我牀邊的牀上，醫生將針穿進他臂腕的血管裏……</p>
<p>「可有數目麼？」他苦着臉說。在這聲調裏，我開始自責着，「你這吸血蟲！」</p>
<p>「不要再把他的血輸過來吧。」我想這樣說，可是，我是自私的動物，我怕少吸了他的血，是不會挽回我的死亡的，終於，我沒有這樣說出來。</p>
<p>輸血以後，沒有多久，我的病便好了。也記不得是那一個月的兩號，我從醫裹出來。這時我感覺到自己的可恥，在生活還不滿二十一個年頭裹，已經使用了殘忍，不道德，和多量的自私。那天晚上，我沒有安睡，良心不斷的向自己資備。可是，人類又是很聰明的東西，在他自覺不安的時候，他又會用很好聽的言辭去安慰自己。當然，我也開始安慰自己啦。「道又有甚麼要緊！我雖然吸人家的血，可是我已經付過代價，同時吸的只不過是一個人啊，我怎麼又能算是殘忍呢？」當我這樣想的時候，我已很安心，我還不能算是一個十足的罪人。因爲現在有多少人不是暗暗的吸着成千成萬甚至整個上海人們的血嗎！</p>
<p>不過，我至今見了血還害怕得很，我終究吸過一個人——一個人的血啊！</p>
<p>我是一個自私殘忍的人！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>眞不知道等候了多少工夫，湘綺才皺着眉頭走進來。</p>
<p>「……你假使不那麼高聲叫喊，十九倒還不致給他瞧見！」湘綺的語氣裹，多少有一些抱怨他的成分。「後來我雖然忙着掩飾，他也很狡猾地假裝沒有瞧見一樣，但看了他那兩顆閃爍不定的烏珠，使我心裹就不由不害怕。」</p>
<p>「那末我今晚就離開這裏好不好，」秋海棠無可如何地說。</p>
<p>湘綺却來不及的搖頭。</p>
<p>「我看他現在一定還在左近掩藏着，一出去倒反而給他瞧得淸淸楚楚。」季兆雄的陰險的性情，在過去的一年中，也已在湘綺的心上留下很深刻的印象了。「要走還是明大走，而且必須我自己先回英租界，故意找一些事把這個人絆住了，然後你才能打這裹動身。</p>
<p>湘綺這一番佈置倒的確不是多餘的，季兆雄方才雖祇聽見了秋海棠的聲音，待他想注　，人已退進了屏後去，所看到的祇是半個後影，一時當然不能認請，可是他看了湘綺的臉色，便估定中間必有隱情，他儘管並不忠于袁寳藩，却決不肯放過這樣容易弄錢的機會，所以他從羅家出去之後，便一直在糧米街上打圈子，決心想揭破湘綺的秘密，湊此敲詐一番。當晚雖然候到九點多鐘還不見有人出來，他的心却還不曾死，準備第二天早上再夫守候；不方湘綺已料透了他的心意，淸早八點鐘使回到了袁公館，就借着他昨天所報吿的那個廚子酗酒打架的事絆住了他，直到吃過午飯，估量秋　棠已搭上火車走了，才讓他自由。</p>
<p>就憑這樣，他後來還特地又上糧米街去了兩次，竭力向羅家的鄰居打聽，多少也給他卉到了些綫索。</p>
<p>一　眼又是三四個月過去了，現在湘綺才碰到了一個真正困難的問題，那就是她腹中的一塊肉！按照受孕的日期推算，這個孩子無疑的就是她和秋海棠的愛情結晶品，可是近來的情形又有變化，使她一時不能就實行走的一法，儘管秋海棠已在滄洲老鄕置下了田產房屋，也無法打破這一個困難。（八〇）</p>

<h3>「龜兔競走」之謎</h3>
<p>— 季潤模</p>
<p>近來，在報紙上，常常可以看到「龜兎競走」這四個字，這是用來形容物價和薪給的不能成爲止比例的，就字面講，對於這四個字，我很表贊同，因爲按諸二年來的實情，薪給階級的支出和收入的確呈現着龜兎　走之勢，即收入如龜行，支出若兎脫，但凶而，却使我連帶的想起了這一隻膾炙人口的故事來了：</p>
<p>這故事或許是大家所熟知的：一兎一龜競走，爭取同一目標，未三步，兎已超出龜身丈許，兎經過幾跳幾蹤後，視目標已近在目前，而龜則猶姍姍來遲，距離遙遠，於是兎自以爲冠軍穩得，不妨中途休憩片刻，藉　養息，詎知醒來時龜已高占鼇頭，自身反瞠乎其後。</p>
<p>這是一隻感人甚深的寓言故事，看過的人無不情願效龜兒的蛇打，而絕不願模倣兎子的自大。然而，現在的物價和薪給究竟是不是這樣呢？從表面上看，物價的上漲的確像兎脫，薪給的加貼　的確像龜行，可是，要是有人發着這樣的問話一一靈活的兎子在競走的中途會不會睡着？呆笨的龜兄能不能先到終點時？我可以相信恐怕誰都不敢回答的吧。</p>
<p>在道理，我們也不妨檢討一下過去三年來的經過，在最初，物慣和薪給相差得還並不遠，正同龜兎初走時一樣的翹首可望；可是漸漸地就由可望不即而至不望不即，才造成現在普遍的卯糧寅吃，捉襟見肘！不過，在大衆的心理，多少還存了一個念頭，那就是眞的像競走故事中的主角一樣，行至中途時，物價會呆着不動，而薪給却加鞭猛進，現在事實證明這一個念頭是絕少可能成爲事實的，那末，普遍的哀求和呼籲自也非爲無　了！</p>
<p>總之，究竟靈活的兎子中途　不會睡着？呆笨的龜兒能不能先到目的地？在目前的環境，這是一個謎，不過我們不能凶之而吾認這寓言的深意，正如謎也總有揭曉的一天。</p>

<h3>Yesterday Afternoon at 2 PM: Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact Signed; Rumor of Japanese Guarantee of Outer Mongolian Territorial Integrity; Soviet Union Makes Similar Guarantee Regarding Manchuria</h3>
<p>Moscow, today at 2 PM, the Soviet Union and Japan signed a neutrality pact. The pact was signed by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka representing Japan, and Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov representing the Soviet Union. (United Press report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement tonight stating that the treaty signed by Japan and the Soviet Union in Moscow today can promote the restoration of peace in the world. Konoe declared that today the Soviet Union and Japan jointly issued a statement in Moscow stating that Japan guarantees the territorial integrity and inviolability of Outer Mongolia, and the Soviet Union makes the same guarantee regarding Manchuria. Konoe stated that the new agreement will serve as the basis for the expeditious and concrete resolution of various issues. (United Press report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington, Prime Minister Konoe's statement that Japan's foreign policy will remain unchanged after Foreign Minister Matsuoka's return from Europe is viewed here as a very cautious statement and not surprising. Informed sources believe that this shows Japan's unwillingness to join the European war, which is similar to the situation before Matsuoka's trip to Europe. The Axis leaders failed to entice Japan to join the war at this time. At the same time, Japan does not want to adjust its relationship with the United States but will wait and see. Matsuoka's long stay in Moscow during his return trip and his frequent meetings with Soviet leaders make it possible to believe the opinion held here before Matsuoka left Japan that the real purpose of his trip was to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, which is also related to efforts to end the war against China. Many believe that Japan has two objectives towards the Soviet Union: first, to establish a sense of security regarding the border of the three northeastern provinces; second, to reduce Soviet aid to China in order to offset the aid China receives from the United States. However, those familiar with Far Eastern affairs do not believe that the Soviet-Japanese talks will have any results because they believe that the Soviet Union is deeply concerned that Germany will attack, so it is still willing to see Japan mired in China, thereby reducing the harm that Soviet Far Eastern interests may suffer.

<h3>Matsuoka Has Long Talk with Stalin Before Leaving Moscow</h3>
<p>Berlin, German News Agency Moscow dispatch states that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka continued to discuss Soviet-Japanese relations with Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night for two hours. Matsuoka is scheduled to take the Siberian train back home starting Sunday, so he went to the Kremlin to bid farewell. This was the second meeting between Matsuoka and Stalin. Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa also attended the meeting. The first meeting was on March 20th. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka met with Stalin again yesterday. Stalin had first decided to meet with Matsuoka at the Kremlin several weeks ago. Stalin rarely meets with foreign envoys, so it is rare to meet twice in a few weeks. Japanese Ambassador Lieutenant General Tatekawa and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were also present at the time. Matsuoka spoke with Stalin for as long as two hours. Afterwards, a Japanese spokesperson issued a statement stating that Matsuoka "expressed his deepest gratitude for Mr. Stalin's interview. His short stay in the Soviet Union this time will be beneficial in clarifying Soviet-Japanese relations." Matsuoka spent his sixth day in the Soviet Union yesterday, mostly engaged in so-called cultural exploration. He visited a machine factory and a geological college. Last night, he went to the Art Theater to watch Chekhov's "Three Sisters." Ambassador Tatekawa also privately invited Foreign Minister Matsuoka to lunch. (United Press report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Durand, a correspondent for the New York Times in Moscow, recently traveled to Japan. He recently had a detailed discussion with a reporter from the Japan Times about the Soviet Union's attitude, stating briefly that the Soviet Union's foreign policy, whether towards Japan or the Balkans, is to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of war, so it will not participate in the war unless attacked. Recently, Matsuoka is meeting with Stalin in Moscow, and there is a possibility of improving Soviet-Japanese relations. It is reported that Durand was sent to the Soviet Union in 1921 to serve as a correspondent for the New York Times, and he did not leave the Soviet Union until 1934. He was sent to Moscow again last year and has been there ever since. (Havas report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Troops Invade Southern Country; Soviet Union Issues Strong Condemnation; Warns Hungary Not to Forget It Also Possesses Ethnic Minorities; Public Believes This to Be an Indirect Slap in Germany's Face</p>
<p>Moscow, yesterday, Hungarian Minister to the Soviet Union Kristoffy visited Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky. Mr. Kristoffy, representing the Hungarian government, stated the reasons for the Hungarian troops' arrival in Yugoslavia and expressed the hope that the Soviet government would recognize the legitimacy of the Hungarian actions. Mr. Vyshinsky replied as follows: If the Hungarian government's subsequent statements are intended to request the Soviet government to express its opinion, then I would like to state on behalf of the Soviet government that the Soviet government cannot agree with this action by the Hungarian side. The fact that Hungary is at war with the southern country, only four months after the signing of a friendship agreement between the two countries, gives the Soviet Union a bad impression. As far as we know, Hungary also has ethnic minorities. If it is also drawn into the whirlpool, it is not difficult for us to imagine what its situation will be." The Hungarian Minister agreed to convey the above reply to the Hungarian government immediately. (TASS dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow, the Soviet Union announced last night that it may take action in the Balkans to counter Hungary under German influence and strongly condemned the Hungarian government for taking advantage of the southern country's crisis to invade its territory. Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky told the Hungarian Minister to the Soviet Union yesterday that Hungary should not forget the ethnic minorities of Ukrainian and Little Russian descent who still reside within Hungary. He also said, "Hungary and the southern country signed a treaty of perpetual friendship just four months ago, and the Soviet Union does not think it is right to go to war with the southern country." According to the official report read by the Moscow radio station, Mr. Vyshinsky also told the Hungarian Minister, "Since Hungary has ethnic minorities, it is not difficult to understand what Hungary's position would be if it were not attacked in times of difficulty." This remark, as interpreted by the public, is tantamount to an indirect slap in Germany's face and implies a possibility of threat, that is, the Red Army may take action to "protect" the Slavic residents of the Carpathian Outer Region. The area was seized from Czechoslovakia by Hungary two years ago. If the Soviet Union explores this method, it can be regarded as retaliation for Hungary's entry into the southern country and can support the southern country in resisting the invasion of Germany and Italy.

<h3>Turkish Diplomats Believe Germany Will Put Pressure on Turkey; Germany's Ultimate Goal Is India and the Far East; People's Hearts Slightly Settled After German Troops Withdraw from Turkish Border</h3>
<p>Istanbul, diplomatic officials here stated yesterday that they believe that the ultimate goal of the Germans' eastward advance is to deal with Turkey, India, and the Far East. These people are gradually convinced that the Germans may try to put pressure on Turkey in the spring as a preliminary step to attacking Mosul. These people say that Turkey is gradually becoming the center of Nazi pressure, and the ultimate goal of the German army is India and the Far East. Germany's pressure on Turkey is already underway. When the Fifth Column spread the news that Germany and Turkey were about to conclude a non-aggression treaty, Germany's pressure on Turkey had already begun. Following the above news, there was also news that Germany and Turkey were conducting negotiations on a trade agreement worth 10 million pounds. According to Ankara news, Germany has not made any proposals to Turkey other than expressing friendship, and the reported news is to confuse the public. (United Press report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, the troops of Germany and Bulgaria have withdrawn ten kilometers from the vicinity of the Turkish border, which has slightly eased the tense situation here. After Germany launched its offensive on the 16th of this month, the country ordered the evacuation of residents of this city, which caused great turmoil in the business community. As a result, the currency price plummeted. The retreat of the German and Bulgarian troops has slightly settled people's hearts, but in general, it is believed that the Turkish border guards may not retreat with them. (Havas report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Budapest, although the rumors that Germany will sign a non-aggression agreement with Turkey have not been confirmed, the general public here believes that Germany and Turkey will sign a commercial treaty in the next few days. According to the National Socialist Party's organ, "Neues Wiener Tagblatt," the fate of the Balkan Peninsula will depend on the great war near Mount Olympus in Greece. At present, the German army is only thirty-five miles away from the Dardanelles Strait in Turkey, but the Turkish government has not yet reacted in any way. (Havas report from the 13th)</p>
<h3>British Staff Officers Leave Turkey and Return to Egypt</h3>
<p>Ankara, British Air Force Major General Elmhurst, Army Major General Cripps, and Deputy Major General Pollock have left for Egypt after participating in talks with the Turkish General Staff. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>On Easter Day, the Pope Broadcasts, Speaking of Belligerent Countries Considering Humanitarianism, Not Using Terrible Weapons</h3>
<p>Vatican City, Pope Pius XII made an Easter broadcast today, urging all warring countries not to use terrible weapons, and the Pope seemed to be referring to poison gas. The Pope also appealed for good treatment of prisoners of war and civilians in occupied areas. The Pope sadly expressed doubt that there is still hope for a peaceful resolution, but he officially stated that he will continue to work hard for peace. Although the Pope expressed regret for the horrors of war, he said, "We must recognize the loyalty of those who fight for their country." The Pope especially mentioned wartime refugees in his Easter blessing to the world. Vatican officials announced that the Pope's speech had been shortened by ten minutes because the Pope, in view of recent developments in Yugoslavia, felt that directly appealing for peace was useless, so he revised that part of the speech. (United Press report from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Hull Delivers Speech on Pan American Day</h3>
<p>Washington, US Secretary of State Hull issued the following statement on Pan American Day today, stating that the American people should unite more closely with the American republics on this Pan American Commemoration Day, reaffirming their determination to protect freedom and justice, and build independent countries in the new world. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>There Will Be No War Between Japan and the United States This Year: A Personal Observation by an American Reporter</h3>
<p>San Francisco, International News Service reporter Major, who arrived here from Manila aboard the President Taft, said, "Chinese or Japanese people think that Japan and the United States will go to war this year. I think there is no basis for this. The Japanese Navy may be forced to take risks and attack in the Pacific, but the Japanese Navy is more stable than the Army and may not rashly provoke a war. Although soldiers from the east may start a major war, I think it will not be realized." (International News Service dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>The Danish Envoy Who Signed a Treaty with the United States Is Dismissed by the Government; The United States Will Use 30 Danish Ships Seized to Transport War Materials to Supply England and Southern Countries</h3>
<p>Washington, the Danish delegation here yesterday said that the issue of whether Danish Minister Kaufmann stays or leaves will be decided by US Secretary of State Hull. According to reports, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned him back because Kaufmann signed the Greenland Agreement with President Roosevelt. (United Press report from the 12th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Danish Ambassador to the United States Kauffmann, who signed the Greenland Agreement, has been dismissed. (Haitong News Agency report from the 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin, people here believe that the Danish government has not recognized the agreement signed by the United States and the Danish Minister regarding the construction of military bases in Greenland. According to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Danish government has never issued such instructions. Regarding the news that the United States has allowed ships to enter the Red Sea, the German side believes that this plan to transport war materials to supply the southern countries was heard a few days ago, but the development of the Balkan war situation has made this plan ineffective. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday issued a statement stating that it refused to recognize the Greenland Agreement signed by the Danish Minister to the United States without authorization with the US government, solemnly pointing out that the Danish government is not bound by this agreement, and stating that Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann has been dismissed for signing the illegal agreement with the United States without authorization. The content of the declaration briefly states that, according to a telegram from the United States, the US government has decided to take measures to protect Greenland and build naval and air bases there because Germany has expanded the war zone to Greenland's territorial waters. However, this agreement was signed by US Secretary of State Hull and Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann, and it was not signed with a special envoy of the Danish King or government, and the Danish King and government did not know anything about this matter in advance. Therefore, according to international law, this agreement has no legal basis and cannot be established at all. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington, it is reported that the Danish government, under German instructions, does not recognize the new agreement between the United Kingdom and Denmark to defend Greenland. According to reliable sources, the US government will ignore Denmark's protest. Reliable sources say that although the Danish government summoned Danish Ambassador to the United States Kaufman, who had concluded the agreement, to show its displeasure, Kaufman refused to comply, and a government spokesperson officially stated that Denmark's action was clearly due to German pressure and would therefore be considered invalid. It is alleged that Kaufman may serve as the head of the Danish government in exile in the United States, handling Danish-American affairs on his own, including the transfer of Danish ships. The frozen Danish assets can be freely disposed of by Kaufman. The above paragraph is likely to be realized, and the United States will expedite the Greenland base plan. (International Telegram from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington, well-informed sources say that the 30 Danish merchant ships recently seized in American ports will be used to load American war materials, travel through the Red Sea, and supply the needs of the United Kingdom and the Erkan countries. The Danish crew members are now very willing to sail to the Red Sea, but they advocate flying their own national flag instead of the American flag. Many believe that a legal ruling from the Chief Justice is required before the Danish ships can sail to the Red Sea, but the loading will not be delayed because of this, because it is expected that all legal procedures can be resolved by the time the ships leave the port. Some American ships currently engaged in trade in East Africa will expand their routes so that they can sail to Egyptian ports south of the Suez. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, it is reported that the Danish government is drafting a wide-ranging protest to the United States because the United States has taken over the defense of Greenland, demanding that the country respect Greenland's "integrity" and proposing to recall Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Balkan War and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>With the expansion of the Balkan War, there have been various startling rumors about the Soviet Union's actions in recent days. For example, the International News Service recently reported that Soviet personnel in London strongly condemned the Nazis, and the Ankara telegram speculated that the Soviet Union would take extraordinary measures. Although such news has a certain degree of psychological warfare flavor and cannot be fully relied upon as credible history, it does express the world's eager anticipation of the Soviet Union at this moment. At a time when Hitler's military power is moving eastward, Churchill's speech pointing out that Germany seems to be trying to obtain Ukrainian granaries and Caucasian oil fields is precisely the intention that has already been displayed in Mein Kampf. Looking at the Soviet Union's intentions, it has shown great concern for the recent evolution of the situation in the Balkans, such as condemning the actions of Bulgaria and Hungary as accomplices and encouraging Turkey and the southern countries to resist aggression with strength based on their non-aggression agreements. All of this proves that the Soviet Union has fully used its opposition to the Nazi use of troops in the Balkans, and the only thing lacking is a public break.</p>
<p>Looking at the progress of the European War, although the initial battles broke out near the Soviet border, they soon turned and expanded on the Western Front. Even though the Soviet-German non-aggression agreement failed to fully ensure the safety of the Soviet Union's western border in the early stages of the European War, and Soviet forces had to rely on fighting against Finland and annexing the three small countries to consolidate its national defense, during the period from the start of the Norwegian war last spring to the intensification of the air raids on Britain in the autumn, no European country had the extra strength or possibility to invade the Soviet Union. After the stalemate in the Battle of the English Channel, Hitler turned to actively managing the Middle East and Europe to consolidate his strength, and swept up several small countries in one fell swoop. The situation between the Soviet Union and Germany has completely changed from before the outbreak of the European War. First, the previous countries of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and even the two small countries of Lithuania, were buffer states between the Soviet Union and Germany, allowing both sides to avoid direct contact. Today, these countries have either been merged by both sides or have formed Nazi vassals, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea outlet. The two countries are almost completely directly adjacent. After the German army recently invaded Eastern Thrace, the Bosporus Strait, the gateway to the Soviet Union's southern border, is almost similar to Leningrad before the Soviet-Finnish War. If the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War was only to consolidate Leningrad's strategic position, then the current situation in the Bosporus deserves serious consideration by the Soviet Union. Second, before the war, Germany's national power was clearly inferior to that of the combined forces of Britain and France, and even when compared with the Soviet Union, it was only on par. However, in the past year, the Nazis have conquered the entire European continent, forming a vast European empire unprecedented in the hundred and several decades since Napoleon. Although it has no other concerns with the Soviet Union during its continued war against Britain, if it defeats Britain one day, it will inevitably form a great threat to the Soviet Union. Third, the essence of the Tripartite Pact is only the strengthening of the anti-communist public pact, and for practical reasons, it cannot but formally and clearly define its relationship with the Soviet Union in the document, in order to avoid causing Soviet unease. In fact, these deceptive tricks cannot completely deceive the Soviet Union. Now that German military power is gradually approaching the east, and the Japanese authorities have clearly stated that they want to include the Siberian Railway within the scope of the so-called East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the anti-communist and anti-Soviet nature of the Tripartite Pact is gradually becoming apparent. Recently, even though the Soviet Union has hinted at its opposition to the Nazi invasion of the Balkans with various attitudes and actions, the German side has gone its own way and ignored them. This has clearly proven that these indirect warnings to Germany have no effect whatsoever.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's consistent policy towards the European War is neutrality and self-preservation. Even though the recent facts are such and it has gradually become impatient, its actions have not exceeded the scope of neutrality and self-preservation. The recent conclusion of the Soviet-German oil agreement and the imminent completion of the Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations all indicate that unless there is an unexpected major change, the Soviet Union's consistent policy will continue to be maintained. But in reality, this is only passive and defensive. It has its own considerable value for countries that keep their word and abide by treaties, but it is definitely not an effective policy to deal with today's aggressor countries. Hitler, of course, does not want to excessively stimulate Soviet sentiment at this moment and may make considerable concessions in small matters, such as withdrawing German troops from the Turkish-Greek border, in order to avoid the escalation of Soviet-German relations. However, unless the Nazis ultimately fail completely, we believe that even these concessions will be compensated for in the future. British and Turkish public opinion both believe that now is the best opportunity for the Soviet Union to come out and intervene in the European War. Whether for the sake of the Soviet Union itself or for the future of mankind, the Soviet Union should not be satisfied with neutrality and self-preservation. If the Soviet authorities believe that the time for action has not yet matured, at the very least, they should take effective countermeasures on the passive side to stop countries such as Hungary and Bulgaria from acting as accomplices, and on the active side, do their best to promote Turkey's immediate fulfillment of its treaty obligations to England, Greece, and the southern countries, in order to use its strength to stop the advance of Nazi forces towards the tip of the Balkans and the gateway to the Black Sea.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Northern Greece All Day; German Offensive Meets Resistance; Heavy Casualties on Both Sides in Mechanical Engagements; Reports of the Fall of Larissa Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Athens: Official sources here announced last night that the valiant Greek army, under the cover of British armored forces, launched a fierce counterattack north of the city of Kilkis and Florina yesterday, routing large numbers of German tanks, motorcycles, and infantry, who fled in all directions. This decisive Easter victory was disclosed in a special communiqué issued by the Greek Intelligence Department. It is said that a strong German column descended from the Monastir Gorge, advanced towards Florina, attempting to attack the western flank of the Anglo-Greek defense line, but was completely routed. It is said that since the German mechanized forces broke through the Monastir Gorge and entered northern and central Greece, the Germans have suffered heavy casualties in their first setback, with significant losses in tanks and other vehicles. (13th International dispatch)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that in the past twenty-four hours, the air forces and armored vanguards of both Britain and Germany have systematically attacked each other, destroying each other's concentration points and lines of communication, preventing them from engaging in a major battle. According to reports from Athens and Istanbul, Yugoslavia has launched an extremely fierce counterattack and retaken Skopje. The resistance of the South Army is very strong, and the German losses are very heavy in the mountain warfare. The British air attacks were concentrated on the German concentration points in Veles, Prilep, and Kicevo (all in southern Yugoslavia), as the German armored forces advanced from those places to the Monastir Pass and south to Florina in Greece. British vanguards and armored forces in the Monastir area also stormed a German assembly point, reportedly destroying a German unit. The British air force also bombed the communication centers of Kilkis and Gevgelija. German and Italian communiqués both stated that the German and Italian armies were implementing the initial plans for a major battle, trying to destroy the concentration points of the Anglo-Greek Allied forces before the decisive battle. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: It is reported that after inflicting a fierce blow on the vanguard of the German mechanized forces, the main force of the Anglo-Greek army is now engaged in a full-scale battle with the German army, which is launching a full-force attack on the main Anglo-Greek defense line. According to Athens radio reports, "Generally speaking, regardless of whether the German armored forces have encountered resistance from the Greek army, they have indeed been blocked by the Greek army. The central Greek front is currently being held by the main force of the Anglo-Greek army, so the advancing German army has now encountered a strong barrier." Athens radio then described the terrible battle from Florina to Giannitsa. It is said that the Anglo-Greek forces repelled a large vanguard of German tanks, motorcycles, and infantry in that area. It is reported that swift-moving Anglo-Greek armored vehicles destroyed many German tanks on the Giannitsa Plain. Giannitsa (also known as Yenice) is twenty-eight miles west of Thessaloniki. It is said that the German army intends to break through the right flank of the Anglo-Greek army in order to attack Larissa. (13th International dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: Columbia Broadcasting Company received a German message broadcast by its correspondent Burke in Ankara, Turkey, stating that on Friday, the German army broke through the Anglo-Greek Olympus defense line and occupied Larissa, an important railway city in Greece.

(13th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to unconfirmed reports, the British army has retreated to the second line of defense and is preparing to withdraw from Greece. Since the fall of Thessaloniki, news of the battle has suddenly gone silent. It is not yet known whether the British army has made contact with the German army. The British army's second line of defense is between Larissa and Ioannina. If this is true, it indicates that the Anglo-Greek Allied forces have been forced to abandon the Olympus Mountain defense line because their left flank is threatened. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>South Army Launches a Vigorous Counterattack in Southwestern Serbia</h3>

<p>Berlin: The High Command announced at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon (11:00 PM Shanghai time) that after six days of fighting, Führer Hitler's Balkan troops had broken through the entire resistance of the South Army in the country's north, center, and south, and are advancing rapidly towards the southern capital, Belgrade, to encircle it. As of today, the news that the southern capital has fallen, which has been widely rumored in the past twelve hours, has not been officially confirmed. The High Command acknowledged that although the South Army had suffered a major blow in the past forty-eight hours, the South still managed to maintain a definite line of defense, and the fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. The High Command also said that the invasion of southern territory by Hungarian troops from the north is obvious. The main body of the South Army's resistance has been pushed towards Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Montenegro, where the three South Army units are fighting behind the Adriatic Sea, gradually gathering together under German pressure.

<h3>British Aircraft Active, Harassing German Army; Athens Raided for Four Hours</h3>
<p>Athens: German bombers and laying aircraft were active over the Greek defense lines for more than four hours yesterday, and Athens opened the most fierce and dramatic night battle, with raids lasting four hours. Squads of German aircraft constantly flew over the suburbs, then dove down into the center of the capital in a sharp, unparalleled posture, carrying out extensive bombing. Two German aircraft were shot down and crashed in flames. At the same time, Royal Air Force bombers continued to bomb the advancing German army. According to a statement, "The German army concentrated in Veles, Prilep, and Kilkis was heavily bombed, but the weather at the time was extremely bad, so the results of the attack are unknown." The statement also said that a large German motorized transport column was heading north to Kilkis in the dark, but our air force machine-gunned it, causing great chaos, and many trucks caught fire and burned. Traffic in Galimeni was also bombed. Another bomber, ignoring the attack of a large number of German aircraft, destroyed the important bridge at Polikastron. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Continue advancing to fight on the upper reaches of the Sava River. However, another Italian army unit departed from the Italian port of Trieste and is advancing towards the Dalmatia region of the South. In addition, the Southern army is also blocking German General Kleit's troops from linking up with the main German force in two locations: south of the city of Nis in the south (upper reaches of the Morava River) and the lower reaches of the Vardar River. The German troops in the mountains west of Taiduvocheng on the Vardar River attempted to link up with the Italian army but encountered strong resistance at the Galkiniq Pass. The German High Command then ordered the German army to attack Ohrid from Monastir to link up with the Italian army. Several German soldiers are currently repairing the railway and highway from the port of Thessaloniki to the capital of Yugoslavia to speed up military operations, as the current transportation line runs from the Hungarian capital to the Bao capital, which is a long journey and not as convenient as this railway line.

<h3>French Military Expert Observes the War Situation: British and German Strengths Compete, Victory is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Vichy. A local military observer recently stated that after the British and German forces made contact on the plains from Monastir in southern Yugoslavia to Florina in northern Greece, the Balkan war is likely to escalate into a large-scale war. Furthermore, with the two armies fighting on level ground, both sides have an equal chance of winning. Both sides possess powerful mechanized units. The outcome of the battle will inevitably lead to the complete destruction of one side's mechanized units, forcing them to resort to infantry. Both sides have considerable experience in mechanized warfare. For example, the German army has fought several battles in Poland and France, while the British army has repeatedly fought with the Italian army in Libya. In terms of the German operational plan, they are advancing from Monastir in southern Yugoslavia in two directions: (1) One route crosses the southern border and attacks Florina in northern Greece. If this route succeeds, it could force the British army to retreat from Florina and then use the city as a base to flank the Greek army in Albania. (2) The other route advances southwest towards Vifo in Greece. If successful, it could open a path in the Vardar River basin and west of the port of Thessaloniki to penetrate the Daissalonike Mountains in northwestern Greece. As the major Greek campaign is underway, the Yugoslav army is fighting alone in the north, and the situation is gradually deteriorating. Before retreating to the western and southern mountains, the Serbian army suffered heavy losses. Although the Southern army is currently fighting desperately to stop the main German force from advancing, it does not seem to have the strength to stop the German armored vehicles and motorized units. In addition, part of the Southern army is currently blocking the Italian army from advancing north of the port of Zagreb and east of the city of Lubiana. After occupying the city of Lubiana, the Italian army has been unable to cross the mountains.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union's Far East Merchant Fleet Plans to Restore Far East Shipping; Many Ships Have Come to Shanghai for Repairs; Trade Expansion Has Also Begun</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi News, recently, Soviet ships have arrived in Shanghai via land routes. The ships that arrived in Shanghai in February included the Smolny (transliteration), weighing 3,173 tons, the Komunsk (transliteration), weighing 2,661 tons, and the Indosleya, weighing 5,326 tons. The ships that arrived in Shanghai in March included the Sukiyes Zito, weighing 4,600 tons, and the Coruche, weighing 3,974 tons. The ships that arrived in Shanghai in April included the Wuakehai, weighing 2,338 tons, and the Korida, weighing 1,671 tons. The ships belonging to the Far East Merchant Fleet are arriving in Shanghai one after another for repairs. Ships can travel between Sakhalin Island and Shanghai once every 20 days, engaging in Sino-Soviet trade. This situation has not occurred in the past five years, so all parties are paying close attention to the movements of Soviet ships. It is rumored that 21 more Soviet ships are scheduled to arrive in the next 18 months. The Soviet government will also send several personnel to Shanghai to supervise ship repairs, and they will temporarily reside in the Soviet Consulate General. According to observations by Soviet personnel in Shanghai, these ships coming to Shanghai for repairs do not currently have any implications for Japan or communist activities in the current Japan-Soviet relations. Since the outbreak of the European War, British and American ships have retreated in the Far East, so the Soviet Far East Merchant Fleet is taking the opportunity to restore Far East shipping and expand Far East trade.</p>
<h3>Strict Security on the Borders of the Two Concessions</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police originally erected barbed wire fences on various roads outside the concession in the west of Shanghai, such as Jessfield Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Da Xi Road, to assist in maintaining public order.

<h3>A Panorama of the United States Navy</h3>
<p>With the situation on the Pacific Ocean becoming increasingly tense, a US-Japan war seems imminent. The full picture of the United States Navy is of concern to readers. Based on the materials in the "Special Issue on the United States Navy" compiled by "Life" magazine, we have selected the following for translation.</p>
<p>Assuming that the United States were to fight at sea in mid-1941, its fleet would consist of the following warships: 12 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 18 heavy cruisers armed with 8-inch guns, 19 light cruisers armed with 6-inch guns, 75 old-style destroyers, 88 new-style destroyers, and 40 long-range submarines. Among these many warships, excluding those used for transportation, supply, attacking enemy ships, and those being repaired and refreshed in shipyards, as well as those damaged by enemy submarines or bombers during combat, the entire fleet represents the naval strength of the United States.</p>
<h3>Majestic Appearance of the US Battleship "Idaho"</h3>
<p>The naval strength of the United States is quite large. Compared with the navies of Britain or Japan, it is in a ratio of 9-5-4. Although the number of American warships is slightly less than that of Britain, their power is greater. If they were to line up for battle, they might be able to win. However, if the central army uses blockades or small-scale battles, the United States could lose the war if not handled well. Compared with the navy of Japan, the power is naturally more than sufficient. American battleships are slower in speed than Japanese ones, but the steel armor is much thicker, and the sailing ability is far superior. American naval aircraft carriers are three times more capable than those of Japan. The firepower of light cruisers is greater than that of Japan. Destroyers are larger in tonnage and faster in speed.</p>
<p>The US fleet is divided into two parts: reconnaissance and combat. The reconnaissance department, composed of heavy cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and aircraft, is responsible for finding the enemy's location. The combat department includes all ships and is dedicated to attacking the enemy. Battleships have the greatest power. Unless they are sunk by the enemy first, they can sink the enemy ship within 15 minutes if they find it. American battleships can fire three volleys per minute, sending eight tons of gunpowder and steel towards the enemy. Therefore, Americans are confident that their battleships can definitely overwhelm the enemy when attacking.</p>
<p>During naval battles, the cruisers are responsible for finding enemy ships, and light cruisers are responsible for deterring enemy ships from attacking. Destroyers lay mines against the enemy's giant ships, search for enemy submarines, and protect the entire fleet in combat.</p>
<p>In addition to warships, the navy also has aircraft to scout and bomb the enemy, chase enemy planes in the air, and observe the fire situation of their warships. The naval fleet is not only a direct tool for fighting the enemy, but also a self-sufficient organization. It has its own rescue ships, repair ships, fast oil tankers, and submarine ferries. It even has a streamlined combat army, namely the so-called Marine Corps.</p>
<p>(1) Great Battleships</p>
<p>Battleships are floating fortresses on the sea, designed to carry large cannons and attack the enemy with fierce firepower. All equipment on the ship is based on the premise of achieving this goal. All the thick and thin steel plates on the ship must be able to protect the cannons on the ship. The large engine in the ship must be able to move the large battleship, weighing tens of thousands of tons, freely in the ocean. The precise machinery in the turret is aimed at aiming at the enemy ship and bombarding it.</p>
<p>In addition to all the equipment on the ship, there are also 1,200 officers and soldiers to drive such a large ship. Their common goal is to fire cannons to attack the enemy. They must have up to ten years of training and stay on this floating fortress. The warship is their only home. No matter how narrow the passages on the ship are or how cramped the rooms are, they can manage everything in an orderly manner. A battleship like the "Idaho," with a displacement of 33,400 tons, is like a small city. The officers and soldiers have set up barbershops, ice cream parlors, tailors' shops, and small shops selling souvenirs on the ship. The profits earned by these shops are used to purchase film projectors, radio receivers, and various small gadgets. Therefore, the people in this warship are much better than other ships in the fleet in terms of comfort and luxury.</p>
<p>A captain on such a great battleship—the captain of the "Idaho" is McKenna—is like the general manager of a large company with capital of US$70 million or the mayor of a city with a population of 1,201. In peacetime, he commands all affairs on the ship, and in wartime, he leads his subordinates to fight the enemy desperately. According to naval practice, the captain must be able to live a lonely life, so those who like to be lively find this position difficult to fill. In order to avoid partiality towards people, the captain must carefully consider inviting people to dinner or inviting guests to banquets. On the starboard rear deck of the ship, there is another deck for his personal use. When the warships are lined up in formation, he always stands on the bridge and does not leave easily.

<h3>Our Country's Cotton Textile Industry During Wartime</h3>
<p>The original title of this article was "Our Country's Cotton Textile Industry and its Production and Sales Overview During Wartime." It was written by Mr. Nie from the Third Continued Compilation of the China National Economic Research Institute's China and Foreign Economic Yearbook (to be published by the World Bureau). The analysis is insightful, and the materials are invaluable. With the consent of the author and the institute, we are publishing the first two paragraphs of his overview of the industry in this journal so that readers can get a quick preview.</p>
<p>An Overview of the Textile Industry During Wartime</p>
<p>The cotton textile industry is our country's largest industry and also the national industry where the economic war between our country and Japan is the fiercest. Before the war, Chinese-owned mills nationwide had 2.92 million yarn spindles and 25,500 looms; Japanese-owned mills had 2.49 million yarn spindles and 28,900 looms; Central Chinese-owned mills had 230,000 yarn spindles and 4,000 looms; totaling 5.64 million yarn spindles and 58,400 looms. If there were no natural disasters or human misfortunes, and the country were peaceful and prosperous, it would not be impossible to increase yarn spindles by 500,000 and looms by 5,000 annually. Unfortunately, the July 7th Incident led to a national war, and most of the Chinese-owned factories were located in occupied areas, either bombed, damaged, or forcibly seized. Those that were able to survive and remain intact were only the 640,000 yarn spindles and 4,600 looms within the Shanghai International Settlement today, and the fourteen small yarn spindles and small number of looms in "Free China."</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the government strongly ordered factories in coastal provinces to move to the rear and continue production. However, because the event happened suddenly, there was no sufficient preparation, and due to various concerns, they hesitated and watched, failing to take action. Soon after, our country's mill concentration areas such as Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Wuxi, Changzhou, Hankou, and other places fell one after another. Those that truly managed to move to the rear were only 100,000 yarn spindles and several hundred looms. Thinking of this, one cannot help but feel disheartened.</p>
<p>The following table shows the Chinese-owned textile mills in occupied areas that were either damaged or seized: (Unit: 1 Spindle/1 Loom)</p>
<p>Although Japanese-owned textile mills in China suffered damage due to the war, with 820,000 yarn spindles and 15,000 looms affected, comparing the figures with the table on the left makes their dominant position all too clear.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Yarn Spindles and Looms in China Before and After the War (All based on an article in the Research Institute's Statistical Monthly. Three points should be noted: (1) The number of yarn spindles and looms before the war refers to the sum of those in operation and those planned to be added; (2) The "after-war" figures refer to the situation in May of the Republic of China Year 28; the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of spindles and looms actually in operation; (3) The "after-war" Japanese mills include the seized Chinese mills under so-called "military management" and "entrusted operation," revealing their intention to monopolize the industry.</p>
<p>Expressing the previous table in percentages yields the following table:</p>
<p>Textile Mills in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to figures released by the Shanghai Japanese Textile Association's survey in mid-May last year, there were thirty-two factories in occupied areas that were seized, managed, and operating; twenty-two factories in Central China, with 483,741 yarn spindles operating (accounting for 81% of the original number of spindles) and 3,722 looms operating (accounting for 65% of the original number of looms). In short, the repair of damaged machinery requires considerable expense, the supply of raw cotton is not smooth (especially in North China), and sales are becoming increasingly obstructed, thus preventing Japanese businesses from fully utilizing the Chinese factories they have taken over for production.</p>
<p>According to a Japanese survey from the year before last May, 500,000 yarn spindles and 3,000 looms in Chinese factories in the Shanghai-Nanjing area were destroyed by artillery fire during the August 13th Shanghai Incident. Although the Chinese factories that moved into the concessions afterwards have increased and expanded, they are still far from their pre-war state. According to the Japanese, the number of yarn spindles and looms in operation in Central China is only 70% of the pre-war level, and in North China, only 75% of the pre-war level. Therefore, production has also decreased sharply. Central China produces 120,000 bales of cotton yarn per month (with Japanese factories accounting for more than half), while North China produces only 40,000 bales per month (almost entirely produced by Japanese factories). These products are mostly sold locally or in nearby areas, with the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Tianjin-Pukou lines, and the Yangtze River basin being the most prominent.</p>
<p>Economic Journal, Issue 366</p>
<p>The rear lacks textile production facilities, and the supply of yarn and cloth has always been unable to meet demand. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has relocated inland, and the demand for clothing and bedding for the military and civilians has become even greater. Relying on the 340,000 yarn spindles and small number of looms in the interior, the strained situation is obvious. In recent years, the government has promoted handicrafts and the textile industry, encouraging increased production of local yarn and cloth. After careful research by technicians, improved hand-spinning machines have been developed and promoted. However, the output is still far from meeting the demand. Therefore, the supply of yarn and cloth to the rear must still rely on Shanghai or foreign countries. The surviving Chinese-owned mills and British-owned mills in Shanghai have become big tycoons, making a fortune from the national crisis, with profits that are unimaginable to ordinary people.</p>
<p>The operation of textile mills in Shanghai is listed in the following table (Unit: Spindles/Looms)</p>
<p>Mill Name Current Number of Yarn Spindles Operating Current Number of Looms Operating</p>
<p>A. Chinese Mills Self-Operated and with Foreign Connections</p>
<p>This autumn of national life-and-death survival has created a golden opportunity for manufacturers. Compared with the profits during the European War more than 20 years ago, the difference is immeasurable. In the past, a profit of two or three million yuan was already difficult to achieve, but now, ten or twenty million yuan is considered normal. Thinking of this, one cannot help but be shocked. The distribution of profits by Chinese factories has never been publicly reported. However, it is said that factories with tens of thousands of yarn spindles are making profits of more than one million yuan. It can be generally seen that the more yarn spindles, the greater the profits. Here are three examples from newspapers for reference.</p>
<p>A. Shanghai Textile Mill (Japanese-owned)</p>
<p>The mill's capital is 12 million yuan, with 152,260 yarn spindles and 2,588 looms in operation. The total profit for the 1940 fiscal year was 22,187,775.63 yuan, approximately 185% of the capital. The calculations for the first and second halves of the year are as follows:</p>
<p>B. Tongyi Textile Mill (Chinese-owned with British connections)</p>
<p>The mill's original capital was 1.7 million yuan, which was repeatedly increased by issuing dividends as stock to 2.97 million yuan. It has 57,808 yarn spindles and 300 looms in operation. The profit comparison for the past three years is as follows: (The settlement period is December 31st each year)</p>
<p>Last year's profit was three times its capital, which is truly astonishing. What is even more noteworthy is that the profits of various Shanghai factories last year were mostly the highest in their history. The four words "unprecedented and unrepeatable" can be well applied to them.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Active and Firm</h3>
<p>New York Cable: The American cotton market is active and firm, rising due to purchases by the industry and Wall Street stock traders. Closing results were three to six points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the statistics for American cotton from August 1st of last year to April 11th of this year are recorded on the left (per 500-pound bale).</p>
<p>The Bombay Indian cotton market is closed. Black market prices have risen across the board, with Bengal increasing by 4 rupees and 25, and Yamla and Balochistan each increasing by 6 rupees.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Futures Crude White Retreats</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's futures crude white slightly declined due to profit-taking sales by囤积户 (speculators). Spot goods are poorer, while refined white is stable. The guild's盘 (market assessment) for spot goods is 24 crude white at 90 yuan to 89 yuan and 8 jiao. The April 20th futures initially traded at 90 yuan 3 jiao 1 fen to 90 yuan, then fell from 89 yuan 8 jiao to 4 jiao, 3 jiao, 2 jiao, dropping about 1 yuan. The end-of-April futures initially traded at 91 yuan 1 jiao, 1 jiao 5 fen, to 91 yuan, then weakened to 90 yuan 9 jiao, 8 jiao, 6 jiao, 3 jiao, until 90 yuan. The牧盘 (closing assessment) rebounded slightly to 90 yuan and 2 jiao, down 1 yuan. Taikoo car (refined) B mark is still 92 yuan at Xizhan (West Wharf), and DY mark is 85 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>North-South Freight: Longan Market Freight Still Strong</h3>
<p>Longan is one of the common tonics and is quite popular. Last year, due to a blockade of the seaport by a certain party, there was a shortage for a long time. Later, someone tried various methods to ship them to Xiamen by boat, and then transfer them to Shanghai, resulting in the highest price. Afterwards, boat transportation resumed, and arrivals gradually increased. This spring, because going to [去化至呆] exhausted, the opening price was less than half of the peak price. However, vendors in this city all seek high profits and are mostly unwilling to lower prices with the opening price, which is regrettable. Later, boat transportation from Xinghua and Quanzhou was blocked again, and the market price originally had the possibility of turning prosperous. However, the state of oversupply still exists, so the production price and the Shanghai market have not been able to escape the divergent phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Suddenly Takes Off</h3>
<p>Vermicelli suddenly took off and rose sharply because the production price was expensive and arrivals and inventories were both scarce, increasing by thirty to forty yuan before and after. Yesterday, Longkou vermicelli was sold for 260 yuan, Qingdao vermicelli for 220 yuan, and Jiangbei vermicelli for 170 yuan, which is an unprecedented high price. Moreover, this item is made from steamed beans and is related to miscellaneous grains.</p>
<h3>Peach Meat Gradually Goes Downstream</h3>
<p>Peach meat is gradually going downstream because sales in Yishui have turned dull, and as the weather is getting hotter, there is a risk of spoilage. Yesterday's market price for Tianjin peach meat was 170 yuan, and Jinan peach meat was 165 yuan, about 10 yuan lower than before.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Lily Bulbs Have Been Lacking for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Lily bulbs have been lacking in supply for a long time, and the market has already opened up for customers and goods. The inventory in the market is also thin, and it will soon be out of stock. Therefore, the market price continues to rise. Since the beginning of last month, it has increased by about three points (三分之 [缺]) before and after. The current market price is actually 150 yuan to 160 yuan. It is still a long time before the new season, and there is a possibility of continued tightness in the future market.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Steel Billets Have No Reduction in Actual Sales</h3>
<p>The trend of black steel billets has been rising for a long time. Because general manufacturers are unable to purchase high-grade raw materials (such as tinplate and [會司鐵] galvanized iron) due to their high prices, they are using the lower-grade raw material of black steel billets within the possible range. This product is quite popular with machine factories, mirror factories, and thermos bottle factories and can factories in this street. Therefore, daily transactions can be considered not deserted. However, there is currently no source overseas, and the inventory in this city is ultimately limited. People in the industry have a very strong mindset and are unwilling to let go easily. Yesterday, the market quoted a price of 3,200 yuan per 2,000-pound bundle. Although the market price has not increased much compared to the previous market, the black market is gradually tightening.</p>
<h3>American Narrow Strip Steel Rises</h3>
<p>American narrow strip steel is the next grade of [會司鐵] galvanized iron. The amount of demand from manufacturers is only next to black steel billets, because its standard is also considered low. Currently, due to the soaring prices of tinplate and [會司鐵] galvanized iron, (the current market price of tinplate is 500 yuan per box, [會司鐵] galvanized iron from old steel factories is close to 400 yuan, and [會司鐵] galvanized iron from new steel factories is also close to 390 yuan), the purchase of this product by toy factories, cigarette factories, and printing factories is urgent. Moreover, there are not many circulating goods, and those who hold the goods have a strong heart, with the offering price rising step by step. Yesterday, every 200 pounds was sold for 320 yuan, an increase of up to 10 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Are Weak in Both Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>After black market cigarettes were囤积堆存上栈 (accumulated, piled up, and stored on the upper deck) by speculators inside and outside the industry, there was already a sense of [满谷满坑] (being completely full). It is cursed that actual sales are gradually narrowing because of the "搬吊证" (transport certificate) problem in other ports, which cannot transport inland, resulting in scattered minds and weak supply and demand. The market atmosphere is stable. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: Great Britain brand 1,199 yuan, Old Knife brand 928 yuan, a small decrease of five or six yuan compared to the previous time; Pin Hai brand 873 yuan, Little Fairy brand 666 yuan, Five Flowers brand 673 yuan, Great Beauty medium box 700 yuan, Golden Mouse brand medium box 460 yuan, Little Beauty medium box 458 yuan, lacking inquiries. Only the prices of high-quality cigarettes are quite tight, such as the ten-cigarette Great Front Gate brand at 410 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes, the fifty-cigarette Great Front Gate brand at 1,368 yuan per 10,000, and the ten-cigarette Great South Gate brand at 1,005 yuan per 10,000, lacking sellers.</p>
<p>What I Saw, Heard, and Thought</p>
<p>The fact that cash needs to be discounted against clearinghouse checks is an "unethical" phenomenon in the currency industry that harms the national currency.</p>
<p>It is said that "this is the result of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications ceasing to supply clearinghouse checks." However, the cessation of the three banks' supply of clearinghouse checks does not affect the total supply of clearinghouse checks, which is actually determined by commercial banks.</p>
<p>It is also heard that "banks often use 'only redeem cash' as a reason for rejecting checks." The currency industry's reserve bank also uses the method of deducting interest to reduce the balance of interbank reserves. Therefore, the supply of cash exceeds demand, and clearinghouse checks have become a rare commodity." If this is the case, then what is the meaning of the orders to "encourage people to save" and "increase bank deposit interest"?</p>
<p>If this kind of "unethical" phenomenon is allowed to exist, then the foreseeable consequences are nothing other than: (1) Creating opportunities for general silver shops and money changers to absorb cash and open up sources of funds. They can "start a business without capital" in the operation of check business and expand their speculation possibilities. (2) Creating an era of flooding clearinghouse checks from silver shops and money changers, because to avoid the loss of cash discounts, everyone will flock to Sichuan Road to open checking accounts.</p>
<p>If it is believed that the restriction of speculation in US dollars is due to the cessation of US dollar checking accounts by American banks in this city, and that Chinese bankers can also curb speculation by shrinking check business, this is truly the greatest fallacy.</p>
<p>To eliminate this "unethical" phenomenon, the matter is extremely simple: (1) Increase the deposit interest rate for the currency industry while lowering the current account interest rate. (2) Do not use "only redeem cash" as a reason for rejecting checks. (3) The reserve bank for the currency industry should immediately release the balance of interest-bearing interbank deposits within the limit.</p>
<p>To ensure that "raising deposit interest rates" does not become empty talk, it is better for the state to bear the increased burden on the currency industry due to the interest rate increase. The interest on the deposit balance of the currency industry reserve bank can also be handled in the same way. However, under the interest rate guarantee system, an audit condition should be attached to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Using "only redeem cash" as a reason for rejecting checks is a means for bank staff to extend their "vacations." It is easy for the authorities of each bank to rectify.</p>
<p>Lowering the current account interest rate can reduce the activity of speculators using checks. It is heard that the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications have now fully accepted cash, so the cash discount has already been lowered. This has already had an "unexpected effect" on the currency contraction policy.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Special Meeting Scheduled to Be Held; Bureau Makes Careful Arrangements; Strict Security Inside and Outside the Venue; Everything Changes After the Change of the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The special meeting and annual meeting of foreign taxpayers has been decided to be held successively at the public grandstand of the Race Club on Jing'an Temple Road on April 17th (Thursday) starting at 2:30 PM. In recent days, the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau has been actively arranging the venue and erecting reed mat sheds to ensure that it can be held on time regardless of wind or rain. The arrangements may still be the same as the situation of the reopened special meeting of foreign taxpayers (February 5th of this year). The podium and the taxpayers' seats are completely separated to prevent accidents. At the same time, for the sake of safety, the police department will send a large number of international detectives and police officers to be on special guard inside the venue during the meeting. The entrance to the venue will be particularly heavily guarded. Except for foreign taxpayers holding election tickets and news reporters with special passes, no one will be allowed to enter without special permission. It is believed that the holding of this special meeting of taxpayers and the annual meeting is completely different in nature from the special meeting of taxpayers on January 23rd of this year, so no unexpected events will occur.</p>
<p>Unanimous Attention to the Issue of Chinese Directors</p>
<p>Among the special circumstances of this year's election of directors of the Public Works Bureau, the issue that the Chinese side is paying full attention to is the issue of Chinese directors. The five current Chinese directors, Chu Qiaqing, Yuan Lüdeng, Chen [陈缺] Rui, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun, the six Chinese committee members Liu Shifang, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guangqun, Jin Tongyin, Zhao Fuding, and Li Wenjie, and the real estate committee member Jin Zongcheng, etc.,</p>
<p>have long been nominated by the current Chinese taxpayers' association for reelection and have been officially recognized by the Public Works Bureau. However, according to the new ratio, the number of Chinese directors has suddenly been reduced to four. Although all parties attach importance to this change, the current Chinese directors, committee members, etc., all strictly adhere to silence and do not say a word. The reporter yesterday telegraphed Yuan Yandeng and Xi Yushu, who are still staying in Shanghai, but both refused to express any opinions on this issue.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Reach a Compromise</p>
<p>Dr. Arles, a foreign Sinologist, published a commentary in the English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly yesterday, stating that the taxpayers of the International Settlement will hold a meeting next Thursday (the 17th). At that time, the compromise reached between the British, American, Japanese, German, Dutch, and Swedish expatriates may be voted on. That is, the current board of directors of the Public Works Bureau will be replaced by a temporary board of directors of sixteen members (including four Chinese directors). If this compromise is approved, it seems that citizens of any nationality will not nominate additional candidates other than the candidates who have already been put forward. Therefore, regardless of whether the election is held or not, these sixteen "temporary directors of the Public Works Bureau" are almost certain to become the directors of the new Public Works Bureau. There is an ancient saying in the East, the general idea of which is "it is difficult to turn back a runaway carriage."</p>
<p>Temporary Measures Are Likely to Become Permanent</p>
<p>The Japanese believe that the temporary board of directors is only a temporary organization, but the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau cannot return to its normal state until the current situation ends. As time goes on, these temporary measures may become permanent. At the same time, the Public Works Bureau, which has traditionally been dominated by British and American directors, may find it difficult to restore its old state. Once the inside story of the negotiations that created this "temporary board of directors" is revealed, the public will be able to realize that the purpose of the negotiations was to delay the current situation as much as possible. Although the allocation of directors to various countries by the "temporary board of directors" cannot be said to reach the ideal standard, it can also be regarded as being unable to achieve the top choice and only seeking the next best. If it were not for the insistence of the American expatriates at the time, the organization of the board of directors would have been even worse. We have no objection to the candidates for the "temporary board of directors," because they are all people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and are persons of status. There is nothing inappropriate about their positions as directors of the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Hope to Pay Attention to the Interests of the Masses</p>
<p>Among the sixteen candidates for director of the Public Works Bureau, fourteen are large businessmen. Although lawyer Ahleman is not a businessman, he is quite close to the business community. Only one person, Mingside, has no relationship with the business community. Mr. Ming is an educator and clergyman who was nominated as a candidate for director of the Public Works Bureau. Mr. Ming's inclusion in the director group as a non-businessman is also a glory for the American expatriates. We hope that the future board of directors will not become another group of tai-pans (大班, foreign managers) in history. We hope that the new board of directors will not focus solely on big business and neglect the interests of small businessmen. Shanghai is currently encountering extremely serious labor problems. It would be most unfortunate if the business community abuses the new board of directors as it has done in the past.</p>
<h3>Secretly Investigate the Addresses of Rice Hoarding Warehouses; It Is Decided to Order Them to Sell</h3>
<p>Unlicensed Merchants Hoarding Rice Will Be Investigated and Punished; A Large Number of Foreign Rice Transactions Were Made During the Holidays</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions have actively taken measures to stabilize the rice market, they have gradually seen results. However, speculation in general is still active, so the entire rice industry market is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and it is difficult for the prices of domestic and foreign rice to fall. Ordinary people and salaried employees are inevitably facing serious threats. In order to quickly seek to relieve the people's hardship and ensure social security, the two authorities are now investigating the real names of rice hoarders and the amount they are hoarding, taking both long-term and short-term measures. Once the investigation is completed, each of the rice hoarders will be ordered to voluntarily release the hoarded goods into the market, otherwise they will be treated as hoarding and speculated, and they will be investigated and dealt with according to law, in order to stabilize people's food supply.</p>
<p>Hope for Exposure</p>
<p>According to another source, in order to thoroughly understand the amount of rice hoarding, the two authorities have not only sent personnel to secretly investigate in separate groups, but they are also afraid that the listening and seeing are not comprehensive and cannot be fully exhausted. Therefore, they still hope that residents of the entire city will report and expose to the two authorities, 分 [缺] the real names of rice hoarders, 分 [缺] the amount of rice hoarded, and 分 [缺] the exact address of the rice warehouses. After receiving the relevant report letter, the authorities will send personnel to secretly investigate the address. If it is found that it is true, it will be registered for future reference. As for rice merchants using trucks to transport domestic and foreign rice, they must report to the relevant authorities in advance or obtain a transport permit. When encountering police detectives checking on the road, they must show the relevant transport permit. Its 分 [缺] is to prevent the smuggling of rice.</p>
<p>Punish Hoarders</p>
<p>The reporter also obtained definite information that the two authorities, in view of the lack of spot chips in the rice market, are due to the fact that large amounts of foreign rice 分 [缺] are not being released from the warehouses. If they are not urgently banned, the future of the rice market will be even more unthinkable. However, unlicensed speculative merchants with ample funds are also to blame for the manipulation of rice. Now the authorities have made a determination and are actively planning measures to punish foreign merchants hoarding rice. Anyone who is outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant and dares to conceal the truth will be severely punished once they are discovered. It is hoped that unlicensed merchants will quickly sell off the hoarded rice and not continue to be stubborn.</p>
<p>Source of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Report [报] Zhan [战] The Thai government will implement unified food rice management, stipulating that all rice exports must be licensed by the Thai government before they can be shipped. However, more than 60% of the rice in this city comes from Vietnam. Rice shipped to Shanghai from Thailand accounted for only 25.7% of the total imports last year. As of February of this year, the total import of foreign rice was 470,000 bags, while Thai rice accounted for only more than 20,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of Thai rice shipped to Shanghai has dropped to 2%. The Thai government's implementation of unified management of rice exports has little impact on the Ministry's rice market. The Thai government is only managing rice exports, not prohibiting them, so rice merchants in this city can still order Thai rice as usual.</p>
<p>Arrivals Last Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was announced by the rice industry that due to the relaxation of foreign exchange last week and the decline in the production price of foreign rice, general legitimate rice merchants, for the sake of contingency planning, entrusted various foreign firms to telegraph overseas rice-producing areas to order large amounts of foreign rice. The rice is now being loaded onto hired ships and will soon arrive here. However, the large amount of Saigon and Yangon foreign rice transacted in the middle of last month has now been successively shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that a total of more than 100,000 bags of foreign rice arrived last week. In addition to being provided to citizens for daily purchase 分 [缺], there are still 30,000 to 40,000 bags stored in warehouses. Therefore, in the midst of this abundant source, the price of rice is still rising step by step, which is very strange. If there are no rice worms at work, why is this the case?</p>
<p>Market Reopens Today</p>
<p>Regarding the future of the people's food supply in this city, since the authorities of the two concessions have taken strict measures to stabilize it, the general public has been quite pleased to hear about it. However, under the control of speculation, it is difficult to predict the future of the people's food supply. Also, since the rice market has been closed for two days from the 11th of this month for the Tomb Sweeping Festival as usual, the number of foreign rice that arrived and was transacted in these three days is considerable. Therefore, after the rice market reopens today, it is expected that spot goods will increase.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Bay Midnight Crossing: Detailed Account of a Sailing Boat Accident: Over One Hundred and Forty Passengers Drowned; Families Grieved and Desperately Searched for Bodies</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese expanded their blockade of maritime traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang, travelers between Shanghai and Zhejiang have often risked crossing Hangzhou Bay. The waterway is over three hundred li in distance, with normally rapid currents and high tides. The only means of crossing are old-fashioned small sailing boats with wind canopies, which speed along relying on the wind, creating dangerous situations. On the morning of the ninth of this month, an unprecedented tragedy occurred. A boat capsized, drowning a total of over one hundred and forty passengers of Ningbo origin and other origins. Only forty or so survived. The accident site was in Fengxian County, which borders suburban Shanghai, at a place called Jinshanwei. It is a half-hour car ride from Shanghai. Considering the extreme seriousness of the matter, I went to the accident site to investigate and personally witnessed the desolate and tragic scene of bodies strewn along the riverbank. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Small Boat Crosses Over Three Hundred Li</p>
<p>The start and end points of the Hangzhou Bay crossing are Andong Town in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, and Caojing Town (i.e., Zhangjiaku, also divided into North and South Ku) in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province. The crossing traverses Hangzhou Bay, a distance of over three hundred li, with very rapid winds and waves. The means of crossing is a type of sailing boat with a wind canopy, commonly called a "Ba Boat." It relies entirely on wind power. With favorable winds and rapid tides, the journey of over three hundred li can be completed in just three or four hours. If the wind is unfavorable or if the boat runs aground during low tide, there are often long delays. Since the maritime traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang was blocked, this place has become a place for travelers to risk returning and forth.</p>
<p>Strong Winds, Rapid Tides, Accident in the Dark</p>
<p>The captain of the Ba boat that capsized at Jinshanwei on the morning of the ninth was about forty years old and from Andong. He had three crew members. The boat had a single mast and canopy, so the hull was not very large. It departed from Andong at 10:00 p.m. on the eighth of this month, carrying over two hundred passengers. The boat was extremely crowded. That night, the south wind was very strong, and the boat was traveling very fast. The boat's final destination was the waters off Jinshanwei, only nine li from Zhangjiaku (where the Japanese troops landed on August 13). At that time, the wind was strong, and the tide was rapid, and the boat was overloaded. The captain and crew realized that the crisis was imminent. Therefore, they did not reach Zhangjiaku and crashed the boat onto the mudflats along the coast of Jinshanwei, hoping to run it aground to alleviate the crisis.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Tragedy Occurs in an Instant</p>
<p>However, the mudflats along the coast of Jinshanwei are very wide. The place where the boat was stopped was two or three li from the shore. The seawater there was waist-deep. At that time, the captain knew that the hull was about to burst. He shouted loudly, ordering the passengers to leave the boat and go ashore. However, it was nighttime. Which way was the shore? Which way was the sea? How could the passengers distinguish in a panic? Even if they stepped towards the beach, the water was still waist-deep. Unless they had some swimming skills, it was difficult to stand and move. Thus, an unprecedented tragedy unfolded. In this event, only forty or so people stepped onto the mudflats and landed ashore alive. Ninety or so drowned on the beach. Forty or fifty bodies that fell into the sea have not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>Most of the Bodies Retrieved are Naked</p>
<p>After the accident, there was an uproar. The residents there were awakened in shock. After learning the reason and guiding the surviving passengers to safety, it was already dawn before they began to retrieve the bodies. However, the local residents had limited knowledge. When they saw that the bodies were wearing gorgeous clothes and had money hidden on them, they were stripped and their pockets were cut open. Therefore, most of the bodies retrieved were naked or incompletely clothed. As of yesterday, about one hundred bodies had been recovered. These bodies were arranged and placed in the pits in an orderly manner, and covered with reed mats for families to identify.</p>
<p>Families Seek Bodies Amidst Cries</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the Datong News Agency reporter drove to Minhang yesterday morning, passing through Xidu, Xiaotang, Nanqiao, Xinxishi, Zhaolin, Caojing, and arrived at Jinshanwei in half a day. He visited Li Ximing and others on the spot and personally inspected the place where the bodies were laid out. Most of these bodies were from Ningbo (accounting for six or seven out of ten), Shaoxing, and other places (accounting for three or four out of ten) who came to Shanghai. Families in Shanghai came to identify them in an endless stream, and cries of grief were incessant. About four out of ten were identified and buried locally. The wife of Zhang Linbao, a Ningbo native living at No. 53, Wufuli, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, was also identifying bodies. Her mother, Li (52 years old), son, Huaqiang (5 years old), and Li Pinghe’s wife (28 years old) and child (3 years old) and Li Guifang's mother (53 years old), Li Jinfu (66 years old), two grandchildren (one 8 years old and one 6 years old), Li Laifa's wife (23 years old), son (4 years old), younger brother (6 years old), Li Sanren (a woman in her fifties), Zhou Ada (a woman in her fifties), entrusted Li Yunqing, a fellow tradesman who was a boatman, to bring them to Shanghai. They also came to Shanghai from Andong on this boat. Except for Li Yunqing, who escaped, all the others died. After Li Yunqing notified the family in Shanghai, they went to Jinshanwei to look for bodies. Only the body of Huaqiang was found. The other bodies were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Where Responsibility Lies; Should be Strictly Investigated</p>
<p>According to Li Yunqing, who escaped, before the boat departed from Andong, he was delayed at the Yadong Inn in Andong. Zhang, the owner of the inn, introduced him to Zhong, an escort at Dalumen, to purchase boat tickets. Each ticket cost fifteen yuan. Most of the other passengers were also escorted to the sailing boat. At that time, Li said to Zhong, the escort, that there were too many people and the sailing boat might not be able to accommodate them. Zhong replied that there were two sailing boats to carry them separately. When they arrived at the boarding place, there was only one sailing boat. It is suspected that the escort and the captain colluded with each other. After the sailing boat had an accident, it immediately split up and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Qiaqing Flies to Chongqing</h3>
<p>After leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong on the seventeenth of last month, Mr. Yu Qiaqing stayed in Hong Kong for a short time. He flew to Chongqing on the morning of the twelfth on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. He will meet with the highest authorities and report to the central government on the work of providing relief to refugees in Shanghai over the past three years, as well as the current situation in Shanghai. After staying for a few days, he will go to various places in the rear to inspect the construction situation. When Mr. Yu arrived in Hong Kong, due to his advanced age, he originally planned to take a ship from Hong Kong to Yangon, Burma, and then travel via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Later, after a doctor's diagnosis, he changed to taking a plane. After arriving in Chongqing, he will rest temporarily at his residence due to the fatigue of the journey.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Scheduled to Open the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The second Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Congress is scheduled to open the day after tomorrow (the 16th). Yesterday, the person in charge of the association hosted doctors and hospitals participating in free X-ray examinations, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Ding Fubao, Wang Wanbai, Zhu Yanggao, Li Baosen, and more than fifty others, to exchange opinions in detail. In addition to asking doctors from major hospitals to perform free X-ray examinations, the association has also compiled and printed an anti-tuberculosis album for distribution to all sectors of society. Anti-tuberculosis propaganda films will be shown in cinemas to broaden publicity. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on the 16th at the Xin Xin Radio Station. Leaders from all walks of life and famous doctors will be invited to give lectures on the latest anti-tuberculosis knowledge to arouse public attention.</p>
<h3>Yesterday was Easter; Prayers Held in Rotation All Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Easter. Clergy and British and American expatriates throughout Shanghai held commemorative ceremonies at the Union Church on Jiujiang Road, Shanghai American School, the Fourth Regiment of the United States Marine Corps Chapel, the Community Church on Jing'an Temple Road, and the Foreign YMCA. It is said that Jesus resurrected on Sunday, so he taught his disciples to pray for it. Therefore, yesterday, various churches in Shanghai held prayer ceremonies in rotation all day, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Labor Unrest in Water and Wood Industries Not Yet Resolved: Over Ten Thousand Strikers; Over Ten Workers Arrested and Released Yesterday; Resolving the Labor Unrest of Ningbo Moving Company Automobile Workers</h3>
<p>Due to the difficulty of life in recent years, factory labor in the water and wood industries had increased wages twice last year. This year, due to the resurgence of prices, after discussions with worker representatives, the Mountain and Water Wood Industry Vocational Union, and after the factory opened an industry meeting, it was decided to increase wages again: nine corners for woodworking, for a total of one yuan and nine corners including the previous amount; eight corners for plumbing, for a total of one yuan and seven and a half corners including the previous amount (a 90% increase); food will also be provided. The Civil Engineering Contractors Association published an advertisement in the newspaper, announcing that the increase would be implemented uniformly from the 16th of this month. Unexpectedly, the workers did not fully understand, and there were still strike actions. Various construction companies reported to the industry association one after another. The association believed that the wage increase issue had already been resolved by the Water and Wood Industry Vocational Union earlier, and the vocational union should be responsible for resolving the dispute and putting an end to it.</p>
<p>Total Shutdown of Water and Wood Workers</p>
<p>After the water and wood workers went on strike the day before yesterday, the number of people participating in the strike originally reached more than six thousand, but some workplaces and workers had not stopped work, which caused dissatisfaction among the striking workers. Yesterday morning, they went to various workplaces in the public and French concessions to demand participation in the strike, and disputes occurred for a time, causing more than ten striking workers to be arrested by the French Concession police. They were released at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday. As a result, all areas in the second and third districts (i.e., the public and French concessions) also joined the strike yesterday. To date, there have been more than ten thousand strikers in total. It is also understood that the industry's labor and management were originally scheduled to discuss solutions yesterday morning, but were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Moving Company's Capital</p>
<p>More than one thousand drivers and workers from Mao Tai, China, Taiping, Ningbo, Yong'an, Shangtian, and other moving companies went on strike on the sixth of this month due to unsuccessful requests for wage increases. The capital has not made any clear statements to date, resulting in a deadlocked dispute. It is now understood that the drivers' union, represented by Sun Lianshan, Liu Yongfu, Xu Xiangcheng, and others, and the chairman of the Capital Freight Industry Association, Lou Yinchuan, negotiated several times, and resolved the Ningbo Moving Company's automobile worker strike at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The main conditions accepted by the capital are as follows:</p>
<p>*   An increase of 30 yuan in rice subsidies per month.</p>
<p>*   Wages will be paid for the duration of the strike.</p>
<p>The capital has also accepted the other details proposed by the workers. Therefore, the company may resume work within the next few days. The capital of other companies is still considering the terms of the agreement, so it is difficult to resolve the matter for the time being.</p>
<p>Mediation of Commercial Disputes Comes to a Standstill</p>
<p>All employees of the Commercial Press were forced to request a discretionary salary increase from General Manager Wang Yunwu in order to maintain their livelihoods. However, the request was not approved, so all employees were quite indignant. On the 12th, they sent a telegram to General Manager Wang at noon, setting a five-day deadline for a response. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "At 5:30 on the 11th, a membership meeting was convened. The crowd was impassioned and authorized the executive committee to request the general manager to promulgate measures based on the principle of the original minimum wage rate from April within five days; otherwise, all employees will swear to fight to the death. Yun Gong instructed us to persuade our colleagues at night, but I object. The petition is completely factual. Colleagues' lives are in dire straits, like refugees. This is the company's shame. Rice subsidies are too narrow, and there are no subsidies for everything else. Yun Gong knows this clearly, but deceives his conscience. Colleagues are suffering, and the company is prosperous. Zhao Liang."</p>
<p>The Great East Tobacco Factory Has Not Yet Resumed Work</p>
<p>Six hundred female workers at the Hede No. 87 factory went on strike at 8:00 a.m. on the morning due to unsuccessful requests for wage increases. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency, after learning about the labor unrest, the Public Concession authorities sent personnel to mediate between labor and capital yesterday afternoon. However, due to the wide divergence of opinions, the problem could not be solved. In order to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible, the Public Concession authorities will conduct mediation again this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade Found on Rue Massenet</h3>
<p>A small hand grenade was suddenly found at the foot of a bamboo fence at No. 23, Lane 833, section of Rue Massenet, at 9:30 a.m. yesterday. It was spotted that the safety pin on the grenade had been pulled out, and there was a danger of explosion at the touch of a button. The police reported to the French Concession police station in Loujiawan, which dispatched officers to rush to the scene to remove the explosive power of the grenade, and then moved it into a box of yellow sand to take it back to the police station for destruction. Meanwhile, detectives were sent to investigate its origin and its intended target.</p>
<h3>Smith, General Secretary of the Naval YMCA, to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Smith, the general secretary of the Naval YMCA in Shanghai, who has served for seventeen years, will leave Shanghai on May 3 on the President Pierce to visit his two sons in Iowa, and then go to the Naval YMCA headquarters in New York to take up a new position. Mr. Smith plans to serve in the United States and will not return to Shanghai to continue as general secretary. However, he is likely to return to Shanghai if the headquarters so orders. Mr. Smith came to China seventeen years ago to serve at the Naval YMCA, and his footsteps have taken him all over Beiping, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places. He just took up the full-time position of general secretary in October of last year, succeeding Mr. Mai's vacancy in the American Red Cross affairs. Once Mr. Smith goes to the United States, his vacancy will be filled by Mr. Kleiner. In addition, Xiang Sheng will come to Shanghai from the United States in the short term and be ordered to serve at the Naval YMCA. (Written by Wang Rong)</p>
<h3>Rumor that Three French Sailors Deserted to Join the Free French Army; Allegedly Related to the Arrest of High Commissioner</h3>
<p>Mr. High Commissioner, a leader of the French community in Shanghai, has been detained on the French gunboat Jary El Ay since he was suddenly arrested by the French naval authorities in Shanghai on the 5th of this month for many days. A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned from well-informed sources in the French community that before High Commissioner was arrested, three French sailors on the French gunboat Jary El Ay, which was berthed in the Huangpu River, suddenly left Shanghai for Hong Kong, and then went to Singapore to join the Free French Army. The French naval authorities believe that the "defection" of the three sailors was assisted by High Commissioner, so they arrested him.</p>
<p>Five People Served</p>
<p>Since General de Gaulle organized the Free French Army in London and continued to cooperate with the British Army to fight against Germany and Italy, French expatriates in Shanghai have been leaving Shanghai one after another to serve in the army. According to reliable information obtained by the French community in Shanghai, five French expatriates in Shanghai recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong to serve in the Free French Army. All five Frenchmen used to serve as police officers in the Shanghai French Concession Police. Two of them were born in Shanghai. This matter happened at the beginning of this month, but they arrived safely in Hong Kong the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Growing Support</p>
<p>The five French expatriates left Shanghai for Hong Kong to join the Free French Army this time, and the matter was quite tortuous. After deciding to participate in the Free French movement, the five French expatriates first fled from the French Concession to the Public Concession, and obtained a certificate of innocence from the British Consulate in Shanghai before boarding the ship for Hong Kong. They will soon be assisted by the Hong Kong branch of the Free French movement to go to other places to enlist in the army to fulfill their wishes. It is also understood that most of the French expatriates in Shanghai currently support General de Gaulle.</p>
<p>The Leader Returns in a Hurry</p>
<p>In order to promote the Free French movement in various places, the leader of the Free France in the Far East, Pang Long, recently set off to inspect various places. He visited Manila, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, and contacted French expatriates in the Free French movement and the British government authorities in various places. He has now finished his official business and returned to Singapore in a hurry. Pang is extremely concerned about the arrest of High Commissioner, the leader of the Free France in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Nanshi</h3>
<p>— Yang Di</p>
<p>Easter, commonly known as Foreign Qingming; the week before is Holy Week, also known as Great Week. The first day is Palm Sunday (or Palm Sunday), which commemorates the story of the people holding green branches, shouting long live, and welcoming Jesus into the holy city of Jerusalem; on this day, the church reads the beginning and end of the Passion written by Matthew. The first day reads the Passion written by Mark; the fourth day reads the Passion written by Luke; the fifth day commemorates Jesus establishing the Holy Body, and the bells are silent for more than two days to express grief. The sixth day reads the Passion written by John. The seventh day is the eve of the Resurrection, also known as the Vigil of the Resurrection. The churches are especially busy during this week. Clergy members often move all over. Dozens of priests and monks from Huicun Church blessed the Holy Oil and participated in the ritual wearing vestments, which lasted for three or four hours. In each church, a new altar is set up in another corner, with the utmost decoration, and the Holy Body is offered day and night. The lights and candles are brilliant, and the people who worship the Holy Body come in an endless stream. The most churchgoers in Shanghai go to Xujiahui on this day; the traffic is busy, and it is a grand occasion.</p>
<p>From the afternoon of the fifth day, I was assigned from Xujiahui to the Dongjiadu Catholic Church in Nanshi to help out for two days. This was my second trip to Nanshi after August 13. The first time was last winter, when I wanted to write an article for the 300th anniversary of the old church, so I went to conduct a field survey. As a result, I was greatly disappointed. The inscriptions and ancient sites were all gone. Therefore, the article was not written. Father Fan of the church wanted to publish a commemorative album, but it did not come to fruition due to various reasons. I remember that it was a day of drizzling rain, and my classmate Qian and I walked in the broken walls and ruins, which was even more desolate!</p>
<p>The first time was between February and March this year, when I went to the Holy Sepulchre Church for a funeral. The Holy Sepulchre Church buries Chinese and Western Jesuit priests who have died in Shanghai since the Ming and Qing dynasties. Wu Yushan, a famous painter of the Qing Dynasty, and Father Yunxi, a descendant of Xu Wending Gong who died last year, their bodies are all sleeping there.</p>
<p>The Holy Sepulchre Church is near MinGuo Road. Zhengxiu Middle School and Xin Puyu Hall are also there. Zhengxiu Middle School has a glorious history. The National Domestic Goods Exhibition and the Congress of the Catholic Action Association were both held there. I went to listen to several lectures when the Congress of the Catholic Action Association was held. Now it's a mess.</p>
<p>That day, I visited the Xin Puyu Hall by the way, and was entertained by Mother Fan. She expressed her gratitude to the philanthropists who generously donated, especially to Mr. Lu and Mr. Deng, who climbed up and shouted about charity.</p>
<p>I already knew about Mr. Lu's personality. Mr. Lu is from my hometown, and I am very honored by this. Before I went to Nanshi the day before yesterday, I visited his office by the way. Although it was the first time we met, we hit it off at first sight and talked for forty or fifty minutes. I designed some religious questions, and he admired the service spirit of the nuns very much. In addition to thanking him in person, I now sincerely salute Mr. Lu and Mr. Deng and all those who do not shirk responsibility and do what is right. "The benevolent live long" and "doing good is the most glorious"!</p>
<p>The Dongjiadu Catholic Church has a long history and is a place for priests in Jiangnan to escape the summer heat and be quiet. Before the war, it had six or seven thousand very enthusiastic churchgoers. Now, only one-sixth or one-seventh have returned to their homeland.</p>
<p>I stayed at this old Dongjiadu Church for two nights. The almost half-moon was shrouded in a hazy mist, as if it was crying, with a sad face. It was very quiet at night, eerily scary!</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the religious ceremony was completed, guided by my classmate Shen, I roamed around the nearby broken walls and ruins. Shen is from Dongjiadu. He pointed to the piles of rubble and broken bricks and said to me: This is the home of a certain classmate, that is the home of a certain classmate; his own home is also included. Several ragged children were excavating on the ruins.</p>
<p>Spending Jesus' Passion Week in such a place, reading the lament of the prophet Jesus, "Touching the present and reminiscing about the past, full of emotion"!</p>
<p>This morning, my classmate Qian and I took a walk along the Huangpu River and MinGuo Road for two hours. The ancients said: "The country is broken, the mountains and rivers remain, and the city is full of spring grass and trees." Although it is early spring, I did not see a trace of greenery when I took a walk; this is because the broken bricks and rubble are piled up too deeply, and the grass and trees cannot even take root! Otherwise, the wutong trees should have been several feet high with weeds and smoke for the past three or four years!</p>
<p>Like the second time I went to Nanshi, I also visited the Xin Puyu Hall today and bought some handicrafts from Nanshi, which are "genuine and inexpensive." Shanghai should be the first to promote it, which is really worth introducing to the public.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shen Bao reported: "Donations to Xin Puyu Hall are becoming more and more enthusiastic," which is very gratifying. However, in today's world where rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, there is no need to spend a high price on electricity and tap water. It is indeed not easy to maintain the lives of hundreds of orphans. Therefore, donations are "the more, the better." I am also happy to act as their advocate.</p>
<p>I remember that four years ago today, I read Chairman Chiang's "Lessons of Jesus' Passion for Us", which was also the day that several colleagues took the lead in converting to Christianity. The lessons of Jesus' Passion for us are very meaningful; the impression I got from the trip to Nanshi is very profound.</p>
<p>Jesus' resurrection is a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation. Hallelujah!</p>
<h3>High Commissioner Left Shanghai for Haiphong Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai news of the Havas World News Agency, regarding the arrest of High Commissioner, the leader of the Free French in Shanghai, the French official recently issued a message stating that after a detailed examination of High Commissioner's physical condition by a doctor, it was deemed that he was fit to sail. The person in question was escorted to Haiphong on the "Kintia" in accordance with the instructions of the commander of the French fleet in Vietnam and in accordance with the Naval Law promulgated on January 13, 1938. Naval officers and Dr. Dennis, a medical officer, also accompanied him. High Commissioner had met with his wife and his defense attorney, Prime, before his departure.</p>
<h3>Pig Slaughterers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the workers of the Minti Neyin Slaughtering Company (commonly known as the Cattle Slaughtering Company) in the French Concession went on strike a few days ago, the strike has lasted for many days. It is now understood that the labor unrest has been mediated by the Fresh Pork Slaughtering Industry Association and the Fresh Meat Industry Association. After negotiation, it was agreed to increase wages and continue to provide food and lodging as usual. The workers are satisfied and have all resumed work yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yien's Pharmaceutical Factory Distribution Center Opens Today</h3>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Resolutions on Education-Related Matters Passed by the Second National Political Council</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) The Second National Political Council was held in Chongqing recently. The council members who came to Chongqing to attend were extremely enthusiastic. The council held consecutive meetings for ten days, and the results were exceptionally satisfactory. At the Second Meeting of the First Session of the Second National Political Council, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education made a report on education, providing separate explanations of government measures regarding higher education, general education, social education, overseas Chinese education, frontier education, and wartime education. Numerical reports were also made on the increase in funding for various educational programs and the increase in the number of students at all levels of schools. Matters concerning the life security and relief of school faculty and students were also elaborated upon. The government also provided reports on the work of other departments, such as politics, economy, foreign affairs, finance, military affairs, transportation, internal affairs, and society. At the same time, council members also put forward many important proposals based on their observations, which were submitted to the general assembly for discussion and were all passed. The resolutions on education-related matters are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  Proposal submitted by Council Member Zhang Qiyun and twenty-one others regarding the need to enhance the effectiveness of academic research to meet the needs of national construction. Resolution: Amended and passed, to be sent to the government for prompt implementation.</p>
<p>2.  Proposal submitted by Council Member Su Ludai and twenty-one others regarding the government's attention to legal education. Resolution: It is determined that the development of law is related to the foundation of the country, and legal talents are needed for construction projects. The government should pay close attention to this matter, formulate detailed measures to achieve the objective. The measures in the original proposal are sent to the government for reference. (2) Students who have passed the current college entrance examination should be exempted from the short-term training or the two-year training for judges in the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>3.  Proposal submitted by Council Members Wang Yaming, Wu Dao'an, Ma Zongrong, Huang Yuren, and twenty-three others regarding strengthening cultural work to benefit the war effort. Resolution: The principles of this proposal are passed and sent to the government for consideration.</p>

<p>6.  Proposal submitted by Council Member Qian Yonghe and twenty-one others regarding the formulation of a plan for the continuing education of current teachers in national schools and central schools. Resolution: The original proposal is passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>(Further News) During the meeting of the Second National Political Council, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, in addition to giving an oral report on the state of education to the general assembly, also submitted a written report. The report on education was carefully reviewed by the council, and opinions were put forward for adoption. These opinions were solemnly resolved by the general assembly. The original text is excerpted as follows: Looking at the education report as a whole, the educational facilities are still in line with national policies. The relief and placement of staff and students, the relocation of schools in the war zone to the rear, the expansion of the number of science and engineering colleges, and the promotion of national education are all intended to preserve the nation's vitality and revitalize the nation's vitality. We are very gratified. However, the implementation of various measures should be carefully considered, such as: (1) The measures for maintaining normal education in the war zone should have greater flexibility, so as to maintain students' academic progress while promoting national consciousness. (2) Public colleges and universities should be adjusted and enriched, and all departments should seek balanced development, so as to avoid students tending to a few departments, which would have a negative impact on society and the country. Assisting provincial and private schools is also an important task, and the amount of subsidies should be increased. (3) The establishment of normal colleges is very practical, but the number of teachers needed by secondary schools nationwide each year should be estimated, and the content of the schools must be enriched. (4) University faculty should be cultivated domestically, but in the short term, sending students abroad is also necessary. The needs of various disciplines should be considered and students should be sent abroad evenly. The research institutes attached to universities should also be enriched. The educational and cultural undertakings run by various Boxer Indemnity organizations should be adjusted to create a rational and systematic distribution. (5) There are many national middle schools and Sun Yat-sen University classes with excellent results, but there are also those that are not perfect. Because these schools are under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, they should strive for excellence and set an example. (6) Vocational schools should encourage further study. In 1940, there were already incentive measures in place, and this aim should be further promoted. Separate incentive measures should be set to instruct the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to pay attention to this matter. The second part of the National Normal College should also be given attention from time to time. (7) National education is tied to the lifeblood of the nation. Recently, it has been heard that some national schools in various places exist in name only, especially in remote areas. The education administration authorities should pay special attention when sending personnel to inspect them. The funding for national education must also be promptly secured so that national education can be popularized as scheduled, and the treatment of teachers should be improved. (8) The editing of textbooks for universities is an important task, but professors have different strengths and different views. The use of the same textbook may hinder academic progress and should be noted. The compilation of textbooks for primary and secondary schools can cultivate common thinking and standardize students' levels. However, in addition to unified teaching materials, attention should be paid to supplementary teaching materials with local characteristics to adapt to local environments.</p>

<p>Chen Linsheng Makes a Comeback</p>
<p>The Qibu Table Tennis Association, to welcome the new President Chen Tianjue, held a welcome ceremony for Vice President Chen at the auditorium of the Fifth Chinese Supplementary School on Nanjing Road last night at 8:00 PM. More than 600 guests attended, making it a grand occasion. First, President Chen Linsheng delivered a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Mr. Peng Ruogu.

<h3>Unexpected Turn in Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Fang Yumin Wins Over Zhang Ying and Takes the Fourth Group Championship</h3>
<p>The fourth Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship elimination round of the fourth group was held at 7:00 PM at the Jingwu Association's billiard room. Pan Yizhi, the grand prize winner of the China United, was eliminated after losing twice to Fang Yumin. Zhang Ying defeated Yuan Zhongxi and Kong Hanchen without much effort. He then fought against Fang Yumin, and after a fierce battle, Zhang finally defeated Fang Yumin with a score of three to two and advanced to the final. Fang, having initially lost to Zhang Ying, then faced Zhang Hanchen. Kong was unable to sustain his strength and was eliminated by Fang in straight sets. Zhang and Fang then had the opportunity to play each other again, and under the contest, Fang performed very well. His backhand shots were accurate, and he defeated Zhang Ying in straight sets, creating a situation where each had lost once and the scores were equal. The two were then re-contested, and Zhang Ying took the lead with a score of two to one in the final. In the fourth game, when the score was nine to eight, Zhang made three consecutive errors, turning victory into defeat, and the two sides tied at one each. At the beginning of the final game, Zhang Ying suffered from hand cramps due to the fierce battle and applied rosin three times, but his holding hand still did not recover. However, Zhang continued to fight, his spirit was very good, but the balls he chopped had lost their control. Fang got this good opportunity and advanced step by step, taking the lead all the way. As a result, Fang eliminated Zhang Ying with a score of three to two and won the championship, an unexpected turn, which was beyond the expectations of the audience. Tonight (14th) from 7:00 PM, the elimination round of the seventh group will be held at the same place. Tickets are two jiao. Referees are Fu Guiqing and Zhu Lianxiang.

<h3>Study Lecture: How to Study Chinese (4)</h3>
<p>— Xue Wujing</p>
<p>(B) Understanding has different levels of depth, and writing has different levels of difficulty. However, our only standard is to be practical and not pursue empty fame. Generally, the initial interest of those who study Chinese comes from novels. The magic of novels is indeed great. I remember an article discussing the relationship between novels and government, saying, "The control of novels is like this: one day of fumigation, two days of immersion, three days of piercing, and four days of lifting." Therefore, all those who read novels are delighted, and their writing skills improve day by day. Further reading of other books will naturally be easy and efficient.</p>
<p>(C) Application: A person who eats must be able to digest and nourish the whole body. A person who reads must be able to assimilate and integrate it into the brain. In the imperial examination era, poems and sayings of Confucius were used, creating a chaotic atmosphere, like parrots learning to speak. Of course, it would be eliminated by the times. We live in modern times, and we require an understanding of the sound and meaning of a word, the change of sentence structure of a sentence, and the chapter, reasoning, and different styles of an article. Poems, songs, couplets, and sacrificial texts have different formats. If there are slight errors, imitate them and understand them thoroughly. Then, when you come out into the world, you will not have any concerns about being incompatible.</p>
<p>(3) Types to Read: Liang Rengong wrote a national studies booklist, and Hu Shizhi also opened an account for one person. They are all-encompassing and have everything. Not to mention that middle school students cannot finish reading them, even university Chinese department students have a headache. This is written to装装门面装装门面 (put on a show) and scare the general public. My friend Ruan Lezhen had a special name for criticism, so I will not elaborate here and pick up other people's words. However, I feel that in addition to the above three standards, the types to be read should be based on the degree of students, the size of the age, the order of the times, the priorities, and the distinction between intensive reading and extensive reading. The first- and second-rate famous works of ancient and modern times, the needs of the times, and the expectations of the country should be included as many as possible, and the selections must be strict. Reading in chronological order will naturally not be 等不严等不严,不贪多不贪多,向养成向养成 (not be 等不严等不严, not be greedy, but develop), a habit of being studious and thoughtful, and never letting go of the book. The booklist will be discussed in a separate article, so it is not quoted here.</p>
<p>(4) Points to Pay Attention to When Reading: Zeng Wenzheng discussed his son Jize's book, saying, "The method of reading, reading, writing, and composing, four things cannot be lacking. … The doctor is like a rich family accumulating wealth, and reading is like foreign trade, gaining three times the profit. Reading is like guarding carefully at home, not spending lightly. The doctor is like a military strategist fighting, and reading is like attacking cities and seizing land, opening up territories. Reading is like deep trenches and high walls, able to defend." It can be seen that reading and reading should be divided into two things. However, times are different, and there are things to pay attention to as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Reading: Extensive Reading, Memory, Excerpting, Index Cards</p>
<p>(B) Reading: Dictation, Recitation, Reading Aloud, Chanting</p>
<p>Although the above is outlined and obvious at a glance, in addition to extensive reading, memory, dictation, and recitation, which do not require much consideration, the other four points have to be further elaborated.</p>

<h3>Food Talk</h3>
<p>— Lini</p>
<p>Professor Gottfried of the University of Vienna once said that, according to his experience, there are indeed many vegetables and fish that can treat dental diseases; among the vegetables, Chinese cabbage and spinach are the most beneficial to teeth because they are rich in lime.</p>
<p>If the intake is specifically limited to the minimum amount of food needed to sustain life, the weight can be reduced accordingly. A professor at Columbia University invented a machine to test a person's minimum amount of food. After measuring the amount, it is used as the standard for food. If you eat no more or no less, you can lose weight. Female students have tried it and it has been very effective.</p>
<p>Taste is closely related to altitude. According to a report from an expedition team to the Himalayas, when ascending to a height of 19,000 feet, the sense of taste is completely lost. Even eating scallions and chili peppers, one does not feel any taste.</p>
<p>Athletes have always avoided sugar during training, but according to experiments by renowned doctors such as Dr. Gordon of Boston, sugary foods are not only harmless to exercise but also beneficial. Runners who drink sweet sugary tea and eat several bean cakes before a race can double their energy. Blood tests show that the degree of fatigue is not as severe as those who run without eating sugar.</p>
<p>Drinking more salt water can withstand heat, because too much heat evaporates a large amount of salt from the body, and drinking salt water replenishes it. The American Academy of Sciences used this method to instruct miners working in tunnels, and they were able to endure the heat after drinking salt water.</p>
<h3>Making a Schoolbag from Broken Socks</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>This publication has published many articles on the recycling of broken socks. However, the use of broken socks to make schoolbags has not been mentioned. Therefore, I would like to talk about the process of making a schoolbag from broken socks, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Currently, most students, especially female students, use schoolbags made of yarn strips, which are mostly made from broken socks. We can cut the worn socks horizontally from the top of the sock to the bottom, forming a long strip. Then, wash and dry them, and dye them in various colors. Then, you can weave them into a schoolbag. They are small and exquisite, and very beautiful. Who would know that they are made from broken socks?</p>
<p>The history of making schoolbags from broken socks is probably less than three years. As far as I know, the practice of using broken socks to weave schoolbags and selling them to various schools was first started by refugee craft centers. From then on, it became popular year by year. Now, some people have even opened factories to specialize in making schoolbags from broken socks.</p>
<p>These factories have roughly three sources for broken socks. (1) People who collect garbage pick them up from trash cans; (2) People who exchange sugar exchange them for sugar; (3) People accumulate broken socks and sell them directly to them. At the current market price, one catty of broken socks can be sold for about five jiao.</p>
<p>After the schoolbag factory collects the broken socks and weaves them into schoolbags, each one can be wholesaled for jiao. Therefore, it costs five or six jiao to buy a schoolbag at a department store or stationery store. The work of cutting socks and weaving is done by female workers. The price of cutting one catty of broken socks is only one jiao, and the wage for weaving a schoolbag is only two fen. However, skilled female workers can earn about one yuan a day.</p>
<p>Schoolbags made from broken machines are not only purchased by students, but also by mothers and sisters who go to the vegetable market, who also like to use this kind of schoolbag to replace vegetable baskets. Because it is not easy for thieves to steal things placed inside. Therefore, schoolbags sell quite well. This emerging industry is just beginning to develop; if you want to run a schoolbag factory, you can start a factory with a capital of three or two thousand yuan. This is a small-capital industry that is easy to develop!</p>
<h3>Methods for Cooking Corn Flour</h3>
<p>— He Li San</p>
<p>"Corn," also known as "Zea mays," is called "Pearl Rice" in Jiangnan and "Six Grains" in Zhejiang Province. These are just different names depending on local dialects. Originally, it was a coarse food, mainly eaten by poor families in the countryside as a staple food or used to feed chickens. City dwellers rarely tasted it. Since the price of rice in Shanghai soared above one hundred yuan, corn has risen in popularity and gradually entered the cities, occupying a place among staple foods. According to a recent report in our newspaper's "Economic News," grain merchants have released 700,000 to 800,000 bags of corn, indicating its widespread sales. Subsequently, due to hoarding, the price has risen from thirty-seven cents to over forty cents. However, the cooking methods are likely not well known. Recently, the owner of Sanyou Industrial Society sent me a large bag of Six Grain Flour. After many attempts at cooking, I am now writing down my experience and submitting it to this publication for residents who purchase it to consider. (1) Cooking with porridge: When the porridge is almost ready, add 30-40% of Six Grain Flour, stirring constantly with chopsticks while adding it. Once it boils through, it can be taken off the stove. If you like it sweet, you can add some sugar. It can also be cooked with rice; add it when the rice is almost ready, but 10-20% is enough, don't add too much. (2) Mixing into a paste and eating: First, boil water, then pour in the Six Grain Flour, stirring constantly while adding it to prevent it from clumping. Once it boils, it will turn into a paste. Add sugar to eat. (3) Making into dough pellets: First, boil broth with ingredients in a pot, adding vegetables, dried shrimp, or pickled vegetables. Separately, mix Six Grain Flour with cold water; it should be slightly thick, not too thin. You can also add wheat flour. Then, use chopsticks to pick up the flour and drop it into the pot, forming dough pellets. Cook until done. (4) Pan-frying: Mix the flour with cold water, add sugar, and then put it in a wok with soybean oil. Slowly fry, first stirring with chopsticks, then using a spatula to spread it out into an egg-skin shape. Fry until golden brown. The taste is quite delicious, with a flavor similar to eggs. You can also add wheat flour to the mixture. The above cooking methods are all very simple, and this flour can replenish the middle and benefit the Qi, strengthen the spleen, and satisfy hunger. Now that rice prices are so high, using it to supplement meals is both economical and healthy. Everyone should promote it during this extraordinary period.</p>
<h3>More on Soy Sauce and Stomach Ailments</h3>
<p>— Qing Cong</p>
<p>After reading my draft "Soy Sauce and Stomach Ailments," Mr. Bai Ma believes that "there are many differences from my understanding," and thus gives the instruction that "soy sauce can cure stomach ailments." However, after carefully examining his argument, it seems to align with my draft and does not deviate much. He also quotes Mr. Xu Zhuodai's saying "fake soy sauce through soy sauce," explaining that inferior soy sauce is indeed unhygienic, which is consistent with my statement. My draft only stated that soy sauce is made from flavorings discarded after extracting residue and residual liquid, and that chemically produced soy sauce, if improperly prepared, may have excessive hydrochloric acid and lacks neutralization, which can easily cause stomach ailments. It is not to say that all chemically produced soy sauces are harmful. Mr. Zhuodai said that chemical soy sauce, although also refined with hydrochloric acid, uses synthetic hydrochloric acid, which is neutralized with "sodium" and thus has no acidity. This also supports my statement. If the preparation is improper, with excessive hydrochloric acid that has not been neutralized, it can indeed harm health. Mr. Bai Ma's father believed that high-quality soy sauce has nourishing properties and can also treat stomach ailments, diabetes, beriberi, heart disease, etc., while fake soy sauce is unhygienic and harmful. The motivation for my previous article was that soy sauce is an essential daily item for families, and its relationship to nutrition and health is so important. Ordinary people cannot understand its benefits and harms, and they are not aware of the distinction between genuine and fake soy sauce. Therefore, I wrote it to urge those in charge of household affairs to pay attention and know what to choose. I have not studied this topic extensively. The information in the previous article was obtained from Mr. Li Youfang of Hengshun Soy Sauce and Vinegar Factory. The Hengshun main factory is located in Zhenjiang, with a history of over ninety years and a reputation throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. What he said is based on experience. I also consulted the "Common Sense of Home Experiments" written by Mr. Tianxu Wosheng. Mr. Wosheng is dedicated to home industry with outstanding achievements, which cannot be compared with armchair strategists, so his arguments must be credible and well-founded. In conclusion, Mr. Bai Ma's point of view differs from mine in that I believe inferior soy sauce can lead to stomach ailments, while Mr. Bai Ma believes that high-quality soy sauce has nourishing properties and can also treat diseases, while unhygienic soy sauce is fake soy sauce. However, the main point, to make people aware of how to distinguish and be careful in their selection, is the same.</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting in the Residence</h3>
<p>— Master of Paper Curtain and Copper Bottle Studio</p>
<p>Calligraphy and painting are sufficient to decorate a residence. In the past, large pieces were valued because they were grand, provided an atmosphere of mist and clouds, and were endlessly fascinating. Even the artist felt free and unrestrained. In the past, Dongjiang Wang Dajue asked my teacher, Mr. Shi Yu, for a painting, but Mr. Shi Yu disliked the small paper and said it was useless. Dajue then presented a poem asking how such a large universe could accommodate a few plum blossoms, which shows that large-scale works were popular at that time. House prices in Shanghai are particularly high, and residences are mostly small, so the style of calligraphy and painting has undergone a significant change, with short pieces of two or three feet being preferred. Mustard seed can hold Mount Sumeru; this is where it can be seen. In Wu Zhong, there were elegant and skilled artists who came to Shanghai as gentlemen of leisure, such as Zhang Xingjie and Zhu Zhuyun. One specialized in flowers, excelling in the styles of Bai Yang and Nan Tian, and the other specialized in landscapes, capturing the essence of Zheng Zhong and Liu Ru. Huang Taixuan and Jiang Yinqiu excelled in calligraphy, with their brushwork described by Emperor Jianwen as both sparse and dense, skillful in both regular and cursive scripts. They were like looking at the watchtower of a city gate or gazing at the stars, not seeking the dispersal of clouds or waiting for the red gates of nobility. Both gentlemen created small works that suited the needs of Shanghai residences. Recently, their works were publicly exhibited on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association. The faces of ancient people and the eyes of modern people are truly captivating and endlessly enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Sleep</h3>
<p>— Bao Fuxing</p>
<p>Sleep is very important. If you sleep eight hours a day, then your sleep is equal to one-third of your entire life. If you cherish your own life, you should equally value your sleep. "Half of life is spent in bed" is a cliché, but it never loses its incisive and insightful nature. Because we sleep every day, we don't realize its extraordinary nature. If you want to taste the sweetness of sleep, it's easy: just don't allow yourself to sleep for three days.</p>
<p>There are many methods of sleep. Generally, we cannot do without two types: going to bed late and waking up late, or going to bed early and waking up early. People who are accustomed to going to bed late and waking up late are not accustomed to going to bed early and waking up early, and vice versa. Someone has proposed a very ingenious method: going to bed late and waking up early. To replenish daytime energy, you can take a nap. In fact, you don't necessarily have to take a nap. Whether it's morning or evening, as long as you have time, you can take a short nap. I think the sleep method above is worth trying, especially for people who like to wake up early and also love the night. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Bamboo shoots are indeed an exquisite ingredient; almost everyone loves to eat them. Even old ladies without teeth have to pick some tender bamboo shoot tips to eat. As for people with good teeth, they can even chew an old bamboo shoot head with relish. Bamboo shoots are not like winter bamboo shoots; the price is much cheaper. Therefore, since spring, bamboo shoots can be seen on every family's dining table. Fortunately, they can be added to both meat and vegetarian dishes. We often eat dishes like stir-fried bamboo shoots with shredded pork, braised bamboo shoots with pickled meat, braised bright shrimp with bamboo shoot cubes, bamboo shoots mixed with gluten, and stir-fried bamboo shoot shreds with wolfberries. They are endless. There are also homemade braised bamboo shoots in oil, which are delicious for eating with rice or porridge, much more delicious than canned braised bamboo shoots in oil.

<h3>I am a Selfish and Cruel Person</h3>
<p>— Li Yutu</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that everyone in the world is selfish, but I dare say that most people have some selfish tendencies. Take myself as an example. Although I don't admit that I am the most selfish person in the world, I already possess many selfish characteristics. For example, for the sake of my eyes, I will cleverly find good-looking movies or novels for them to watch. For the sake of my ears, I will cleverly find good-sounding music or songs for them to listen to. For the sake of my mouth, of course, at a dinner table, I will find the best food and put it there... In short, I will seek all kinds of happiness for myself; as long as it benefits me in any way, I won't let it go.</p>
<p>Six months ago, because of my excessive love for my mouth, I fed it too many things and became seriously ill. It was then that I realized that I had been greatly fooled by my selfishness. The doctor forbade me from eating anything; I could only drink a little water each day. My stomach was rumbling with hunger, and my mouth was crying out for emptiness. During the ninety days in the hospital, I spent seventy-five nights dreaming of Tianjin steamed buns and Cantonese char siu.</p>
<p>My illness gradually entered a dangerous state. Every day, a lot of blood came out with my stool. My body became thinner and thinner day by day, and my spirit became weaker and weaker day by day. According to the doctor, it was typhoid fever with bleeding, which is a very serious condition. I anxiously begged him to treat me, and he said, "Except for first transfusing blood to save you urgently, which can temporarily prevent death, there is no other way." Because I was afraid of death, because I was selfish, I agreed.</p>
<p>The next day, the person who sold blood came. When I saw him, I couldn't help but be shocked.</p>
<p>"Can he also sell blood? He's such a thin person!" I asked the nurse in surprise.</p>
<p>"Of course, he sells blood after a thorough examination," she replied.</p>
<p>"No, you misunderstood me. I know he's been examined, but he's already so thin. Won't he get sick himself if he loses more blood?" I finally felt sympathy.</p>
<p>"He's willing to sell blood, so what does it matter to him!" This was the reply.</p>
<p>The blood seller lay down on the bed next to mine. The doctor inserted the needle into the blood vessel in his arm...</p>
<p>"Is there a limit to the amount?" he said with a bitter face. In that tone, I began to blame myself, "You bloodsucker!"</p>
<p>"Don't transfuse his blood anymore," I wanted to say, but I am a selfish animal. I was afraid that if I didn't suck enough of his blood, I wouldn't be able to avert my death. In the end, I didn't say it.</p>
<p>Not long after the blood transfusion, I got better. I don't remember which month it was, but on the second day, I came out of the hospital. At this time, I felt my own shame. In the less than twenty-one years of my life, I had already used cruelty, immorality, and a large amount of selfishness. That night, I didn't sleep peacefully. My conscience kept accusing me. However, humans are also very clever creatures. When they feel uneasy, they will use very nice words to comfort themselves. Of course, I also started to comfort myself. "What does it matter! Although I sucked someone else's blood, I have already paid the price. Besides, I only sucked one person's blood. How can I be considered cruel?" When I thought this, I felt very relieved. I couldn't be considered a complete sinner because there are so many people who are secretly sucking the blood of thousands or even the entire population of Shanghai!</p>
<p>However, I am still very afraid when I see blood. After all, I sucked someone's blood—one person's blood!</p>
<p>I am a selfish and cruel person!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(6) Product of Love</p>
<p>I don't know how long I waited, but Xiangqi finally walked in with a frown.</p>
<p>"... If you hadn't shouted so loudly, he probably wouldn't have seen you!" There was some resentment in Xiangqi's tone. "Although I tried to cover it up later, he also cleverly pretended not to see anything. But looking at his two flickering black eyes, I couldn't help but be afraid in my heart."</p>
<p>"Then should I leave here tonight?" Autumn Begonia said helplessly.</p>
<p>But Xiangqi shook her head hastily.</p>
<p>"I think he must still be hiding nearby now. Going out would only allow him to see everything clearly." Ji Zhaoxiong's sinister nature had already left a very deep impression on Xiangqi's heart in the past year. "If you want to leave, it has to be tomorrow. And I must first return to the British Concession myself and deliberately find something to keep him busy, then you can leave from here."</p>
<p>Xiangqi's arrangement was indeed not superfluous. Although Ji Zhaoxiong had only heard Autumn Begonia's voice, by the time he wanted to pay attention, the person had already retreated behind the screen. All he saw was half of their back. Of course, he couldn't recognize them immediately, but looking at Xiangqi's expression, he estimated that there must be some hidden secret. Although he was not loyal to Yuan Baofan, he would never let go of such an easy opportunity to make money. Therefore, after leaving the Luo family, he had been circling around Grain Rice Street, determined to uncover Xiangqi's secret and use it to extort her. Although he waited until past nine o'clock that night and still didn't see anyone come out, he hadn't given up hope and prepared to wait again the next morning. However, Xiangqi had already seen through his intentions. At eight o'clock in the morning, she returned to Yuan's mansion and used the matter of the cook getting drunk and fighting, which he had reported yesterday, to keep him busy until after lunch, when she estimated that Autumn Begonia had already boarded the train and left, and then let him go.</p>
<p>Even so, he later went to Grain Rice Street twice specifically, trying his best to inquire from the Luo family's neighbors, and he did get some clues.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, another three or four months had passed. Now, Xiangqi was facing a truly difficult problem: the flesh in her belly! According to the date of conception, this child was undoubtedly the product of her love with Autumn Begonia. However, the recent situation had changed, making it impossible for her to implement a method immediately. Although Autumn Begonia had already bought farmland and houses in his old hometown of Cangzhou, it was impossible to overcome this difficulty. (80)</p>
<h3>So It Is</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Foxes and dogs collude, wolves and jackals work together. Although they try their best to conceal and cover up, putting on airs; in the end, they cannot avoid the "suspicion" of "colluding."</p>
<p>There are many skilled deceivers in the world; and the skilled deception of hoarders is even more "just right." So, it's no wonder that a bunch of "ignorant people" become confused and unable to distinguish right from wrong...</p>
<p>Those with "clear stomachs" unconsciously become complacent: thus, they publish solemn announcements, recounting a painful story, expressing "enthusiasm," and sparing no "tears and snot" for "caring about people's livelihoods." They look as if they are even more pitiful than the poor old men who have no thin porridge to drink. Truly, whoever is not moved by their "compassion" must have a "heart of stone!"</p>
<p>As a result, the "ignorant people" will naturally become confused and unable to distinguish, quietly and happily thinking, "We will repay you in the next life by wearing grass and carrying rings..."</p>
<p>In fact, to speak frankly: they are all birds of a feather, so it is!</p>

<h3>The Mystery of "The Tortoise and the Hare Race"</h3>
<p>— Ji Runmo</p>
<p>Recently, you can often see the four characters "Tortoise and Hare Race" in the newspaper. This is used to describe the inability of prices and salaries to be proportional. Literally, I very much agree with these four characters, because according to the actual situation of the past two years, the expenditures and incomes of the salaried class do indeed show the momentum of a tortoise and hare race, that is, income moves like a tortoise, and expenditure is like a hare escaping. But unexpectedly, it made me think of this well-known story:</p>
<p>The story may be familiar to everyone: a hare and a tortoise race, striving for the same goal. Before taking three steps, the hare has already surpassed the tortoise by a dozen feet. After a few jumps and bounds, the hare saw that the goal was close at hand, while the tortoise was still slowly coming, far away. So, the hare thought that the championship was secure and that it might as well rest for a while in the middle to recuperate. Who knew that when it woke up, the tortoise had already occupied the top spot, while it was left far behind.</p>
<p>This is a deeply moving fable. Everyone who has read it is willing to imitate the tortoise's persistence and never imitate the hare's arrogance. However, is that really the case with current prices and salaries? On the surface, the rise in prices does seem like a hare escaping, and the increase in salaries does seem like a tortoise moving. But if someone asks such a question—will the nimble hare fall asleep in the middle of the race? Can the dull tortoise really reach the finish line first? I believe probably no one would dare to answer.</p>
<p>In principle, we may also review the past three years. In the beginning, the difference between prices and salaries was not very far, just like when the tortoise and hare first started running, looking forward to reaching the goal. However, gradually, it went from being able to look forward to it but not reach it, to not being able to look forward to it or reach it, which created the current common situation of spending tomorrow's money today and making ends meet! However, in the psychology of the masses, there is still a thought, that is, just like the protagonists in the race story, when they reach the middle of the road, prices will stay still, while salaries will advance vigorously. Now, the fact proves that this idea is very unlikely to become a reality, then the general pleas and appeals are not in vain!</p>
<p>In short, will the nimble hare fall asleep in the middle of the race? Can the dull tortoise really reach the destination first? In the current environment, this is a mystery, but we cannot deny the deep meaning of the fable, just as a mystery will always have a day to be revealed.</p>
