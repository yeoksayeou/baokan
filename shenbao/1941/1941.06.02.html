<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國遠東政策不變</h3>
<p>若干時來，國際間無形存在着一種暗流，對於壁壘早見分明的遠東現局，依然以種種姿態憧憬着綏靖政策的復活；固然，其中有的只是一種神經戰性質的不根謠詠，沒有重視的價値，但是若干人士之因為納粹威脅的嚴重而企圖使遠東問題從歐洲戰爭分離者，亦復不容吾認。加以日外相松岡自歐遄返後，曾經一度透露對於美國的幻想，而松岡訪美以及邀請美元首赴日等種種微妙的主張亦曾斷續喧騰於報章人口，美方所傳日本對於軸心冷淡的消息便正是此等印象所引起，因以造成一種可能以懷柔政策促成日本脫離軸心的幻想。半月以前，英外相艾登曾在衆議院內以堅決態度說明英政府的遠東政策，羅斯福爐邊談話發表之後，赫爾國務卿復重申美國對日態度不變以為補充的說明；其實美英當局對於遠東的現行政策都無可懷疑，世人亦不應置疑，而其竟前後相繼從事鄭重說明者，到正是證明了種種疑雲暗霧之深可注意，甚至連美國會都對於羅斯福那一堅決明顯的演說發生了曲解。</p>
<p>二十七日羅斯福氏爐邊談話所表示的態度，正如本報昨日社論所指出：是一個非交戰國所能採取的最積極的舉措，其對於侵略罪行的譴責之所以單獨提出了納粹和希特勒，不過是因為德國是侵略陣綫的重心所寄，斷不容曲解為對於其他幫兇助虐者的放鬆或寬恕。假如說羅氏眞在各侵略國家中有所軒輊，那首先是義大利應該表示寬慰，因為那一談話當中根本沒有提到法西斯黨和莫索里尼；而其對於中國作戰的稱讚，與夫加强援助中國的諾言，正足以表示其對於遠東的重大關切。把遠東問題縮小到中日戰爭，並不是美當局的避免刺激日本，而是現節段的遠東問題實以中日戰事為中心。美國對於遠東的關切根本是防禦性質而不是進攻的假如不是日方有意發動對美戰爭，抑或使美國遭受刺激到不能忍受的程度，美方並沒有在遠東作戰的必要。但這並不能曲解為美當局的綏靖企圖，正有如美國迄今不對德宣戰之不能曲解為對德具有幻想一樣，而那些如此揣測者也許到眞是綏靖政策的信徒。羅氏所宣布的對華予以額外援助，如能在時間和器材的品質和數量方面都能恰合客觀上的需求，容或比較美國自身的直接參加太平洋作戰更足以防戢遠東侵略慘禍的擴大。繼赫爾解釋美國對日政策不變的聲明而後，據聞美國軍方已允許大批空軍駕駛員及機械員來華，赫爾更於隔昨向中國新任外長郭泰祺表示美國將於中國抗建成就而後，着手聯合在華享有領事裁判權之國家將在華所保存之最後數項特別權利予以取消，這一方表示美國的援華行動正在擴大實施，另一方面，更足見其對華政策的根本精神和立塲所在，這都是與綏靖政策絕不相容的。</p>
<p>所謂綏靖政策，在國際間曾造成了無數罪惡，並間接促進了屠殺人類破壞文明的侵略大戰，却至今仍未完全絕跡於國際政壇之間，事誠可異，也許這就是人類惰性的表現吧！遠自協的國容忍德國在來因設防，近至美國對於維希法國的懷柔運用。其間種種，無往而不僨事，其獲有成就者殆屬絕無。即就遠東的過去而論，在三國締盟之前，綏靖政策曾經一再實施，結果却只是使遠東的國際分野更顯明，侵略者的貪欲更鴟張。時至今日，日本內部，固不無期望對民治國調整關係之主張者存在，但姑不問其有無左右政局的能力，即使其眞有脫離軸心關係可能，其所要求的代價當亦高昂非常，除非美國可以修改維護正義反抗侵略的根本立塲而外，可斷其絕對無法接受，更何祝其內部迄今仍屬急進的實力派佔有優勢，調整對美關係的要求已漸被忠於三國同盟的聲浪所壓倒。</p>

<p>日軍用車　携有武器</p>
<p>查公共租界虞洽卿路以西地段、為美海軍第四聯隊防地、以往因日軍携有武器、擅自闖入該區、由日當局保證以後不發生同樣事件、而吿解決、詎料昨日上午八時三十分許、又有日軍之蓬車一輛、防軍照會為三六五號、　載日本憲兵軍官一名、護兵二名、均着便衣、又司機一名、由滬西向東、駛入美防軍防區靜安寺路、當時美防軍發覺該車內携有武器包裹二個、惟因日軍汽車行駛甚速、一時不及攔阻、</p>
<p>追趕阻截　形勢緊張</p>
<p>乃由麥令斯隊巡邏隊三員、急駕三輪機器脚踏車飛速追趕、至靜安寺路大光明影戲院前追及、當時美軍車立卽停車截阻、欲予檢查、而該日憲兵等不願受查、於是雙方相持、均打電話至各該部隊報吿、於是日憲兵隊卽派來汽車一輛、駛至大光明前、上載日憲兵二名及憲佐一名、談判之下、仍木能解決、繼續成相持局面、一時形勢至為緊張、</p>

<h3>米商輾轉售賣港米　企圖私運出口　港米貢米訂購運銷概須登記　一部米商居心叵測應予嚴懲</h3>
<p>本市洋行界日前曾接由越南同業來電、以越南　穀即將開始登塲、本季因播種時雨水均勻、故屆時收穫、已可預卜、又據米業界消息、某米行昨亦曾接得香港同業電吿、現越南政府因新穀即將登塲、故已准大宗高次貢米運滬接濟、米商自接獲該項電文後、刻已在積極準備大量訂購、又據航業界消息稱、嗣後儎運貢米所需航輪、可無虞缺乏、輸運水脚費用、或將繼續遞減、故米商採辦洋米、成本將愈低廉、</p>
<p>米糧登記　根除投機</p>
<p>兩租界當局為澈底穩定民食起見、已定期辦理存米登記、頗博得各界好評、僉以當局之實施該項措置、殊為投機之當頭棒喝、若輩嗣後將無法中活躍、記者昨走訪當局負責者、叩以當局對於該項辦法將如何執行、據稱當局深以米價若不亟行抑平、則社會治安恐難確保、故穩定民食、已堅具決心、關於米糧登記等、雖早經建議當局、惟茲事體大、故遷延迄今、始予實施、顧當局之輸米糧登記、即係穩定民食治本之一部分、善於治標部份、猶待米業各公團繼續努力、當局決非將予以恊助、同時對於米糧登記、當局決非不稍加疏忽、定將從嚴辦理、</p>
<p>運銷貢米　概須報吿</p>
<p>昨向米業方面控悉、法租界當局為統制貢米在本市運銷、及防止運滬貢米被囤戶居奇抬價起見、除組織進行委員會外、並規定關於貢米在本市訂購運銷事宜、須一律先予登記、米業方面以目下在米市塲上營業之銷數售價等、雖逐日登記、但到貨及訂購數量、則尚未登記、故靜候接得當局之正式通知後、再出米業團體、商定如何登記辦法、</p>
<p>嚴禁港米　轉運外埠</p>
<p>某氏繼稱、至於工部局此次不惜任何犧牲、向香港政府採辦大宗仰光特別小絞米、非特品質甚佳、且其售價、亦較他種米糧低廉、故上中下階級市民、爭購該項米糧、頗絡繹於途、刻據經辦洋行報吿、該項洋米、已運滬者為數已逾月供數額之一半、現已出售者亦遠已運滬者之半數以上、卽十萬包左右、顧當局之採辦港米運滬發售、旨在穩定民食、救濟平民、而竟有一般居心叵測米商、以米糧轉運外埠出售、獲利較厚、胆敢在塲轉售港米、企圖外運、今當局決將予以嚴厲禁止、嗣後經售港米者、均須將每日出售港米數額、向立基祥茂兩洋行翔實塡報、不得諱言其事、而杜流弊、</p>
<p>米糧出口　嚴格檢查</p>
<p>昨據熟悉米市者語記者、本市各色米價、若無投機作祟、及大戶繼續的把持囤貨、米價恐已跌入百元大關、然邇日米價非特不趨下游、反見高峯、市况倐緊倐鬆、人心猶動盪不安、據渠所知、現有一二家米行、企圖在本市扒吸大宗現貨、轉運澳門杭州福建海門等地漁利、每待在塲動辦時、持貨者即乘機居奇、各色米價非特無法下游、反衩頻頻做高、若輩之嚮當局請領搬出證時、即揑造種種、以冀當局置信、即利用該項搬出證、將高次等米糧租用車輪輾轉外運、故目前之亟待實施者、即　在塲辦貨者、每日應有限制、　米糧轉運、當局應從嚴檢査、</p>

<h3>郵局鉅劫案　匪軍當日發現　車夫供稱駛往施高塔路　因係日人住宅未便搜查　捕房會同日方憲兵偵緝</h3>
<p>宇林西報云、昨日（三十一日）上午九時三十分左右、此間白畫發生一巨刦案、當時有華人與日人各一名、乘出差汽車至北叫川路郵政管理局內、刦得巨款二百五十萬元逸去、一般相信、出差汽車夫一名、巳被公共租界警務處拘獲、嗣即將其移交予日憲兵、以便從事偵査、木案最足令人驚異者、爲盜匪並未使用軍器、同時郵局之苦力與管理人員、亦竟誤認盜匪爲郵局職員、而任其爲所欲爲、</p>
<p>日人駕車　從容刦去</p>
<p>據郵局會計科長格林　爾稱、當盜匪出現時、該項鉅款共計分裝十袋、正由苦力四名、運上裝甲之卡車中、由郵務員一人、主持監督、其時盜匪突乘坐租界照會五一五二號、巿照六五五號之綠色汽車一輛而來、下車後、其中一人（日人）卽以日語與監督搬運之郵務昌談話、該郵務員以為該日人係由日本當局派來進行調査或搜查工作者、故着另一華人往寫字間報吿、當時該日人卽與同來之華人將該項巨款栘入其自已乘來之汽車中、衆人正在驚疑之際、該日人巳與其同黨華人駕車疾駛而去、至此在塲之郵務員苦力及保鑣等、方始覺悟係已遇刦、遂鳴警追捕、但盜等早巳不知去向、</p>
<p>捕房調查　拘獲司機</p>
<p>於是立即報吿捕房及日當局、經虹口捕房包探調查後、始悉盜匪所乘坐之汽車、係虹口勝大汽車行所有、當即前往該行、將司機人拘獲、據該司機人在捕房供稱、是晨有日人與華人各一名前來租車、囑令駛往郵局、　郵局載運包裹十袋後、卽令其開往施高塔路某號房屋、卽照給車資而去云、當包探將該司機人帶往施高塔路實地調查、但抵達該處後、發見司機人所指之房屋、係日軍當局所居住者、至此該包探因無權入內、遂不得不中止調査、而將全案移交日憲兵辦理、該司機人亦交與日憲兵以便査詢、昨日消息靈通方面相信、木案之發生、郵局方面恐有內綫、否則盜匪決不能如此從容不迫、刦此巨款而逸也、</p>
<p>匪徒諉稱　日方派來</p>
<p>據稱被刦之款、係中香港郵局解來、預備為南京郵局建造新房屋之用、因星期五銀行休假、故保存於郵局內、直至昨日、始擬解往郵政儲匯局存儲、據郵局某職員稱刦款之日人、曾向監督苦力之郵　員諉稱、渠係奉日當局之命而來云云、常時該日人及其同黨　人均未出示手槍、顯然以欺騙手段而得售其計、故探員相信盜匪或許並無武裝、亦未可知、</p>

<h3>華商股市最近之推展</h3>
<p>— 王雨桐</p>
<p>現代產業之發展，首恃金融之調劑；蓋金融之於產業，猶血脈之於人身；苟無血液之流通，則身體必將腐朽；反之，金融苟無產業為之維繫，亦猶血液離去身軀，無由發揮與顯示其本身可貴之功能。故血脈與身體兩者，如影隨形，不可須臾分離，資本市塲與金融巿塲，在今日經濟發達之國家，必相輔並進，雙方發展；金融市塲以票據之承兌貼現為中業，是為短期金融，資本市塲以證券之承受買賣為要務，是為長期金融，使兩者果能週轉靈活，調節適中，使國內游資有正當運用之門，工商實業亦受資金靈活便利之惠，其有助於國家經濟之滋長，決非淺尠，我國公司證券，在昔向無買賣之市塲，致公司股票之流通不易，投資者亦慮資金之呆定，相率趦趄不的，集資募股自覺困難萬狀，因使生產事業仍侷促於一隅，結果社會游資從而流人於投機之途，徒足為害金融，此今日一般論者之所以謂提倡資本市塲之不容稍緩也。按我國往昔證券巿塲之售賣對象，大部分為公債；而企業公司之股票或債券證券市塲，交易者寥若晨星，故將來必俟我國整個金融機構如（一）余融體系之形成與銀行分業制度之確立，（二）余融市塲之充實，（三）紙幣發行之統一與中央銀行機能之發揮，（四）全國資力之集中與銀行合併運動，（五）繁榮工商事業與低利政策之實施等各項組織完成以後，應由特種銀行領導金融界籌設實業證券巿塲，使業巳發行之企業公司股票與公司債券，固得在市塲上買賣流通，抑目可以扶助新企業之創設與發展，承　或代銷企業之股票或公司債券，俾該項新發行有價證券易於銷售，而新企業方面，亦易於獲得所需要之資金，將來於我國產業前途，所關實非細也。</p>
<p>近自上海外股紗花黃金等投機市塲迭起風波，國人不察，惑於聽聞，致陷身其中而耗資傷財者，巳不知若干，有識者乃起而提倡推展華商股票業務，冀使麕集滬地游資，逐漸導入正軌；兼以助長企業界之繁盛，於是經營華商股票同業，遂聯台共同組織公開買賣市塲，逐日刊布行市，其買賣方法略仿外股交易，其中交易最稱普遍者為：浙江興業銀行，金城銀行，中一信託公司，通易信託公司，華商電氣，閘北水電，新新公司，大新公司，永安公司，先施公司，永安紗廠，大生紗廠，新亞藥廠，家庭工業社，中法油脂廠，南洋烟草，大中華火柴，華成烟草，商務印書館，中華書局，康元製罐廠，冠生園，梅林食品公司等，茲就上述各公司分別列為簡表於下：</p>
<p>（註）上表根　中國股票公司報吿及最近調査製成，×係港幣，普　普通股，先係優先股</p>
<p>上述各公司股票，不過就現時巿塲買賣為遂日成交種額中經常所見者，而摘舉之，如（一）商業銀行股之上海，浙江實業，浙江興業，金城，中一信託等，皆因其本身業務擴充，基　穩固，有以致之，又如通易信託自經民國二十七年二月改組復業，資本額定為一百三十六萬元，同時發行無利債券一百十八萬七千九百四十五元，股息方面自二十七年份起保息週息三釐，以兩年為限，二十九年份雖改廢一釐，然同時無利債券開始還本百分之一，足以顯示其業務已漸入正軌，（二）百火業之永安，先施，大新等均有長足之進步，至新新公司，其資本總額為國幣三百五十二　元，共中優先股三十二萬元應享惟利五年，業巳滿期，經該公司第十五屆股東常會決議，所有股息，一律政為週息八釐計息，故二十九年份股息巳發八釐，其業務方面，自去年擴展新商塲後，成績日有起色。其他附屬事業如創設新都飯店，綠實劇塲，薪新利髮廳等，亦均見順利進行。（三）新藥業如五洲藥房之股票市價，已超渦票面一倍有餘，新亞，信誼，中曲各廠，不特股息優厚，且逐年皆增資擴充，如新亞去年官息及贈息達三分之多，中法藥房，去年因創設中法血淸廠，中法油脂廠及本身業務之展拓，實行增資，二十八年份之股息與增資贈與共合週息五分之多，（四）烟草業如南洋兄弟，華成等，皆為個中翹楚，南洋兄弟曾於戰後，添設香港重慶兩分廠，營業極盛，聞該公司所存原料，至少在兩年之內，足敷自用，可無需外求，此外該公司尙擁有鉅額之外匯基金，營業前途，未可限量，二十八年份墊發股息一元，二十九年份墊發二元，（五）他各冠生園，梅林，泰康等食品公司所發股息紅利，亦頗優厚，且各增資擴充云。</p>
<p>以上所述不過就各公司之內容，略舉一斑，藉以覘華商股市最近之推展情况，所望有心人士，共起提倡，務使金融與生產事業，打成一片，則他日不特為中國金融業放一異彩，抑亦足為產業前途稱慶也。</p>
<h3>論今日之勞工問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 胡錫山</p>
<p>工資問題</p>
<p>人類欲求生存，則必須有生活費用；勞動者，即賴其工資之收入，以維持生活。換言之：勞工即工資來取得其生活的必需品，以繼續其勞動力，惟事實上，吾國勞工所能獲得的平均工資，僅够支持其最低的生活費用，且在一時期內，工資額大都是有定數而不增的；然維持生活所需之費用，則在是不停地隨着巿塲的價格而變動着，自戰爭以來，各地物價，其指數均在上漲，例如上海五項對工人發生最密切關係之生活必需項，其指數均在上漲之列，如食物一項，二十五年時指數爲一一七，四五〇，而三十年四月增加至八一五，〇　；燃料一項，民國二十五年時之指數爲一九〇，三三，三十年四月增加爲七五九，五四；於此物價上漲，貨幣購買力下降的情態下，工人生活，勞必感受無限的苦痛，因而生活難以安定，而致影饗工作效率，其挽救方法，勢非加增工資不可。然按生活費指數之消長，抑依實際情形而加增工資呢？事實上，生活費指數不斷上漲，雖按率加增，仍不足以追及實悄；結果未必獲效。現在大都採用生活津貼之方式，依當地物價，及工人之生活情形，訂立津貼的標準，但這基本標準，至少仍應根據生活費指數才行。</p>
<p>工時問題</p>
<p>在抗建今日，為適應巨額之物資需要，對勞工之工作時間，是否應予提長，以求生產量之加增？亦為一應加硏開之問題。在平時，一般的見解：工人的勞動時間，當以每日八小時為標準；蓋此種主張，乃屬一側重人權之社會目的。此主張的存在，確有其實際的理論據，惟在　時，為增加生產數　，而將工勞動時間延長，並不能謂是小顧人權之社會”的；蓋戰時勞動時間的問題，其與社會目的所發生之論據，原則上完全一致，平時所要求　縮工作時間者，其原因無非是在防止資本主的剝削勞動者，在戰時今日，這種現象，由於政府的力量，不致存在；透切的說；戰時的勞動時間問題，已不是一個基於社會目的上之問題，而是個應適合於經濟目的上的條件，依據經濟的目的而言，為求增加生產之數量起見，不能不加增勞動時間；惟吾人不能將勞工的工作時間，作絕對的提長：前提條件：尙在求工人於工作時間中的勞力不致虛用，因每一工人的勞力有限，勞動過度，勢必疲乏而影響及工作的效率；故於提長勞動時間之中，亦當考慮及疲乏程度；最佳能採用動作分析及時間分析，則可使工作所費勞力，能正確而效率提高。</p>
<p>施行優良工人指導制</p>
<p>工人之對工作乏技術，或不認真工作，可謂勞工問題之最　　者，任何產業中，其生產品質之精良及工作效率之優良與否，對之機器及原料，固有直接的關係；而工人工作之成色，其關係之重要，並不減於機器及原料，近代工業技巧，不特徒籍機器於原料之良好，尤在工人技術之專精。但工廠往往因無良好之管理人員，致無優良技術之工人。在吾國現今之情形下，爲求訓練工人時間之節省，及減少雇用管理人員之費用，而期達產品的精良及效率之加強，則可採用優良工人指導制。此制即在全場中選出工人技術較爲純熱者若十人，制定爲全廠的基本優良工人；在工作時，此等優良工人即隨時兼行指導其他工作較劣之工人，並糾正之，在工作之餘，他們的職務則爲訓練其他工人，為求此制進行之方便，可分別徧成小組，按級而上；例如每一優良工人規定指導十人或十五，每十個或十五個優良工人之上，可設一最優良工人，以指導基本優良工人；由是按級的而達工廠的技師或廠長，此種軍隊化的組織，非僅可促進工作之效率，目更合呼戰時組織的要求。（續完第三七一期）</p>
<h3>集中清算制度</h3>
<p>— 喬</p>
<p>所謂「淸算制度」，其實就是物物交換的貨幣形態。訂約國雙方，依約進行貿易；毌須收付現　，而僅就賬面上劃算。這是强制維持國際收支平衡的經濟獨裁。導源於德國，最初祇限於一國間訂立雙方的「淸算協定」，現在已　進成「多角的清算制度」。「多角的淸算制度」，開始於－九四〇年九月德意協定成立之後。根據協定，義國對德國佔領區內之一切收付清算，均經由德國淸算金隊辯理；而各　佔領區內相互間之淸算，亦均可經由該金庫進行。這個－德國淸算金庫」，於是變成德國佔領區所有對外債權債務的代表人了。因之比利時可以拿對荷蘭的債權，在金庫賬面上，抵消他對挪威的債務。同樣的，意國也可拿對甲的債權，來抵消對乙的債務了。於是過去一淸算制度」下常發生三四個淸算餘額的賬項，現在變成只有一個餘額，處理上也就較前簡單得多。</p>
<p>這　「集中淸算制度﹄還有1點好處，那就是可使出口商迅速收回出口貨款。在過去的「清算制」下，中央銀行的淸算賬面如無相當寬裕的在款，出口商要想很快的收回其出口貨價，往往很不容易。大為對手國不問其貿易的一般狀况和季節情况，凡在出超塲合而持有對方相當鉅大的淸算殘餘債權時，便不允將　自對方的新貨款即予支付，因此對方的出口商，便非等過相當長的時期不可。但在「集中淸算」的這個新制度之下甲乙二國的貿易差額，可以對丙的差額來軋算。過去的那種呆板，在這種彈性下便有排除的可能了。</p>
<p>還種「集中淸算制度」的彈力性，以參加國家越多則越好；因為關係各國的經濟　造及供需種類越　雜，則彼此抵扯的可能也就越大；那是　而易見的。</p>
<p>然而要確保這種，集中淸算制度」的應付裕如，先決條件便需一種中心貨幣，可做其他各種關係國家貨幣價値的標準。而這種中心貨幣，事實上就是其各關係國幣制的母體。換句活說：擁有這種中心貨幣的國家，其實就是擁有其他各關係　的貨幣宗主權。說得更明白些，牠就是這個貨幣　團的盟主，而所有參加這集團的幣制乃至其國家民族，都不過是他的附庸能了。唯其如此，德國之所以能創設　樓制度，當然只限於被他佔領或受他控制的國家，而且也只限於他這種佔領　　制地位沒有動搖之前。因之：截至一九四〇底止，歐陸各國參加這種「集中淸算制度」的國家，有如次表之多，實非意外。</p>

<h3>長生果（一）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>新　大陸不特供給我們那奇妙的「神糧」樹—可可樹—，叫我們能够染指神們所享受的食品；它還賞賜我們這甘美的「長生」菓—落花生，—希望我們能够保持永遠的生命！神糧樹的身價高貴，現在：中國還不過只是少數的大都會人土，能有幸福一親它的杳澤，而長生菜呢，則謙　下士，從公元十七世紀以來，就已竟惠臨到我們中國，同我們任何窮鄉僻壤的村夫孺子，全結成了知心莫逆之交！所以它同我們的關係要格外的親密哩。</p>
<p>落花生的拉丁學名叫Arachis　hypogaca，中國的名子還有番豆，地豆等稱呼，而最文雅的當然還是長生菓。它的祖國又是在新大陸的南美滿，而且叫人頂稀奇的是，它同甘薯和番薯的關係一樣，也是一對攣生的弟兄！有一位原住在巴西國的，身體比較粗大魁梧，殼中普通只含兩粒長圓形的花生米；那一位的勢力範圍却在秘魯，身體更為纖細淸癯，殼中能含二四粒幾乎正圓形的花生米。它們兩個在哥倫布發現新大陸以前，早已就分道揚鑣，各圖發展；所以要問它們的桑梓故土究竟是在巴西抑或在秘魯？這又是現在還沒有人能揭曉的一個謎！</p>
<p>大自然該定了；身懷奇材異能如同落花生弟兄兩個的，不應該局促的隱沒在獉榛狉狉的印第安土人中，而是應該出而濟世，嘉惠普天下的黎民的。所以新大陸的門戶開放以後，它們也如同共他寳貴的植物一樣，雲龍風虎，相繼騰達。住在巴西的那一個，是受了葡萄牙人的聘禮，遠涉驚濤的喬遷到非洲西部，由是而子孫繁衍，逐漸把勢力擴張到幾內亞灣一帶和東非洲。住於秘魯的呢，却應了西班牙人的敦請，甘冒駭浪的卜居在菲律濱羣島和摩鹿加羣島，也從這兩個中心向四外發展，終而足跡遍歷了太平洋上的各個島嶼，各個國家。至於落花生的傅播到中美洲，墨西哥，和北美各處，也是由萄西兩國人的不謀而合，由東西兩面夾攻而侵入的。（未完）</p>

<h3>衣食住行之貨賽診談</h3>
<p>— 玉一之　自荷蘭寄</p>
<p>及　春而集之貨樣賽會，在彼西方入陸之歐洲商塲，每以引致切奉業之向上進展。以言外國　代價之昂與來源之缺，甚堪影響民生，易地以觀，萬方同慨，自古出人頭地之雄才偉傑，未有不因時勢之變化，一激而成驚人之大業者，是即古說所謂時勢造英雄。例如　困療貧新貢獻，化學家福民裕國，功同良相而德比良醫，致用不服於一途，成功不囿於一格，不當只以勤造西藥補品為止境，而失却百年難再得之大好良機。茲特分述『古渡Utrecht貨賽』成立二十五周年之六件珍物，以資談瀛選勝者舉一反三之助。</p>
<p>（一）無蠶而得絲：北歐木料，化成纖維板半製品，輸入荷國，經過幾度化舉作用，變成「稠學之黏液Viscose」，加以澄濾，通過細孔而成絲。計成機維絲，以及有光與無光之兩種人造絲。</p>

<h3>夏季的衣食養生</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>光陰像流水般的飛逝，轉瞬之間，又揭開了夏的序幕，夏，是人們服惡的，畏懼的，暑熱薰蒸，使人汗流浹背，而且它的氣氛又極難聞，若不在此時期，講求衛生防護，是很容易醖釀疾病！所以兩租界當局，最近正在積極推行防疫運動，爲市民免費注射防疫針，通吿各酒菜館，自六月一日起，取　冷盆，改用熱菜等：這都是防患未然的上策，筆者茲將衣，食，二項，夏令的衛生，約略摘記一二，以吿讀者。</p>
<p>在夏季裏衣着務求單薄，取其凉爽，這是正當的；但有些人，尤其是勞動者，他們感到熱的時候，連汗衫也不願穿一件，任令赤膊，—即是半裸體，這樣非但不雅觀，而且最不衛生，因為赤膊，最易為毒蚊等來吮吸血液，皮膚上便要起塊，或者觸着銳利的東西，皮膚破裂，易致潰爛！所以熱度不論如何的高，護身的汗衫是必須要着的！此外在早晚之間，更須勤於沐浴，衣衫常洗常換，如是一方面保持身體的淸潔，一方面不使衣服久着汗漬霉爛，而耐久穿，又夜間睡眠，不可貪凉，薄被或錢毯是不能不蓋的。</p>
<p>「病從口入」，這是一句至理名言，所以人們對於飲食，是應該注意的，尤其在夏的季節裏，更要特別謹愼！比如生冷品和未熟的水菓等，總以少吃為宜。其他菜餚亦以多吃素菜，少吃葷腥為妥，又凡夏日隔宿的飯食菜餚，很容易　，寗可犧牲不吃，但為愛惜食物不忍拋棄，可將多餘的飯菜等，在晚間入釜第煮一過，蓋好放在陰凉的地方，就可免餿了</p>
<p>以上所述，雖是老生常談，不過能够如此，巳可免除不少疾病了。</p>
<h3>醬油發霉問題</h3>
<p>— 辛</p>
<p>黃梅大快到了，家家人家廚房裏的醬油，就容易發霉，這是一個很大的問題。因為醬油一發霉，不但很不衛生，而且醬油的滋味會變壞，所以那些主婦們，往往很想知道，如何可以使醬油不霉。</p>
<p>前大遇見徐卓呆先生，我就把道問題去請敎他，他說：「我們的良妻牌醬油，是絕對不會霉的，因為裝出來的時候，都先消過毒的。」他還說：醬油不消毒，熱天就保不定不霉，如果有生水攙入醫油中，或是因器皿上有水跡帶人醬油中，都可以使醬油速霉。</p>
<p>普通不消毒的醬油商，為防止發霉起見，大約用下列幾種方法：（一）用水楊酸作防腐劑，這是本欄已有人談過，易致胃病，並不妥當。（二）用其他無害防腐劑，種類雖多，價都很昂，在成本上未必合算。（三）在裝出的時候，加些鹽在髪內，但往往不易溶解，至醬油用完髪底尙可以發現鹽粒，效力當然不會大。若是盡行溶解的話，鹹味太强，父容易减少鮮味，也不是好辦法。</p>
<p>總而言之，最好是消毒，不過近來燃料昂貴，有許多錙銖必較的醬油商，往往不肯做這種良心的工作的。</p>
<h3>鄉居散記</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>蘇城葑門外，水行三九，鎮名舟直，先賢陸　蒙先生故里，陸卒時人謚曰，甫里先生，地以人傳，相延迄今，即以是名名其地。距崑山密邇，舟直為蘇崑合界，一河而分，吳淞江橫貫其問，實京滬水程孔道。</p>
<p>保聖寺唐塑事變前時賢提倡，專員保管，遐邇傳誦，咸推為吾國之藝術精粹。余來也晚，未能一瞻廬山眞面，引以為憾，蓋兵駐於是，今雖故物無恙，非箇中人不能一涉獵其間也。</p>
<p>全鎭環水，東西南有橋可駕，獨北則缺如課口有八，非舟不能達，戰事西邁，得未遭兵燹者，職是之故歟？</p>
<p>鎭有居民三千餘戶，戰前創有　燈電話，各口設有電網及鋼骨水泥瞭望台，居高遠矚，一覽無遺，交通有「蘇舟」「崑舟」對頭班輪，往來尙稱便捷，城市鄉鎮，無以與也。</p>
<p>此地土肥產豐，五穀而外，水族首　名品，頻年租風大壞，農氓均面面團團，惟民性好博，傾家蕩產者不可勝數。且遍地萑苻，謹愿者亦米能安枕。鎭民飽食終日。無所事事，皆以雀戰為戲，籌碼頗大，動輒數百，以是賭風鼎盛。武局設有數台，恃以為生者數百人，領袖份子，腰纏萬貫，妻妾盈室，婢僕盈庭，豪奢埒於公侯云。</p>
<h3>節約經驗談</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>近米　得最厲害的，要算是煤球了，由十元狂跳到一倍左右，眞是大家都很憂慮，因為一個家庭那一天可少得掉用煤，所以我們該儘量節約用煤。筆者現在巳每天改為祇煮一次中飯，把飯特別煮得多，夜飯就拿中午吃剩的飯，加冲開水吃泡飯，這樣可以减少一頓煮飯的用煤。佐菜亦實行每天祗煮一次，早餐買些大餅等吃吃，根本用不到煤。早晨洗臉改為冷水洗臉，這樣免得早上起來就要生火，在起初實行的幾天，的確有些異樣得難受，可是現在倒慣了，聽說洗冷水臉對於皮膚很有益處，所以決定實行下去。這樣本來一天生火到晚的煤球爐，現在祇中午生一次，省掉了用煤量的十分之六左右，眞是於負擔上倒不無小桶，我想這個辦法在一般經濟的小家庭倒可效法一下的。</p>
<h3>推薦一本切合需要的家庭刊物</h3>
<p>— 思人</p>
<p>最近，看過了三卷一期的健康家庭月刊，很使我高興於它的內容的豐富，立論的警闢。它在縱的方面曾經分析過祖子孫三代之間愛的錯綜，愛的連繫，在橫的方面，曾經曉諭過如何可以使夫妻之間的情感能够經常保持，家庭的快樂能够、永恒維持，在精神方面，指出過利害所在，在物質方面，也吿訴過成敗關鍵。本期的潘仰葊的多情自古空餘恨」，是根據了生物學和心理學的理論來指出愛情的特質，並聲言多情之未必有利，文筆輕鬆，立論精警，堪為靑年男女之當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>「禁忌」之在我國社會，由來巳久，其措置之無謂，稍有常識者類能知之，奈積習難易，每令有心人士為之擲筆三嘆！本篇由胡山源氏執筆，用極淺近之常識，力闢「禁忌」之荒誕我說，要是有者改之，無者加勉，對於時間，精神，經濟、節省倒是很有裨益咧！</p>
<p>父母之愛子女，原係出於天性，任何人都不能說不當，但是愛之而出於過份，違反事體，那末愛之適足以害之，過去的事實，當前的例子，斑斑可考，數見不鮮，本期該刊中有「小金的故事」一篇即係針對溺愛而發，切望有心的父母們能够一加體味！</p>
<p>除了上述諸篇外，其他像「我之家庭經濟支配法」歷述非常時期中開源節流的並顧兼籌，「乳孃曲」，描繪動亂時代下的奇　，「晦鳴」，叙述封建家庭的餘毒等都是極合時代而切合需要的。</p>

<h3>抵是高中畢業</h3>
<p>— 企明</p>
<p>畢業以後，奉了母親的命令去見表叔，求他在他的銀號中給我一個位置。事先，母親對我說：「你父親在生的時候，曾給你表叔許多好處，這次他一定能够容納你的請求。」於是我換了一件剛洗過的藍布長衫和一雙新的布鞋</p>
<p>到了表叔那裏，我向司閣說，經理是我的表叔，但是他帶了驚訝的眼光看着我的藍布長衫，布鞋和空空的雙手，似乎不相信我是經理先生的姪子。經我再三申明，他才允許我進去，湊巧表叔有客到了，我又只得在房門外等候</p>
<p>等了很久，客人走了，我提心吊膽地走進表叔的經理室，看見桌子上放滿了許多禮物，我想大概是剛才那位客人留下的。</p>
<p>很奇怪，表叔也像司　一樣，注視着我的藍布長衫，布鞋和空空的雙手，旁邊一個我不相識的女子問道：「他是誰呀？」</p>
<p>表叔支吾地回答說：「他嗎我幾乎不認得了，他是……。」但是他沒有說出來我是他的姪子，彷彿怕我丟了他的臉。那個女子倒也很乖巧，並不窮究，一雙狡猾的眼睛移到我的身上，使我十分不安。</p>
<p>表叔皺着眉頭叫我不必陳述來意，原來他有先見之明早巳知道了，接着他說：「你只是高中畢業嗎？」「是的，只是高中畢業。」</p>
<p>於是表叔搖着頭說：「很難：一個高中畢業生會幹些什麽事情呢，二我萬萬料不到表叔會說這些話，十分慚愧，回答不出話。</p>
<p>表叔指着旁邊那個女子　續說：「這位　小姐是　　大學的畢業生，在這裏才當一個書記呢！」顯然，表叔借了她，要把我奚落一番，於是她很得意地帶了輕蔑我的語調格格地笑。</p>
<p>我只得紅着臉兒，忍了一肚氣，辭了出來。</p>
<p>臨走的時候，表叔勉强地補充着說：「很難！有位置的話，三天內儘會通知你。」他彷彿警吿我不必再踏進他底高貴的經理室。</p>
<p>走出了房門，聽見表叔說：「哈！哈！這個小子居然想……。」接着又是那個女書記格格的笑聲。</p>
<p>我夢也想不到會有這樣的結果。表叔連父親的名字也不曾提過。回家以後，我沒有勇氣吿訴母親今天的遭遇，只說表叔叫我多侯三天。</p>
<p>母親發狂　希望着，三天之內我會找到一個位置。她說：「你讀書的成績不錯，這次一定能够得到表叔的重用……。」接着她掀起了一陣微笑。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，三天都過去了，毫無信息，這是我早料到的，母親等得心焦，在第三天的晚上，她親自跑去尋表叔，我勸她不要去，但是她不肯聽我的話。</p>
<p>深夜了，母親回來，從她紅色的眼圈裹，我知道她一定是和我一樣地被表叔侮辱，她重新流着淚珠吿訴我，表叔說我有點傻氣，是個痴子，這時我感到一陣心酸，但是「傻氣」，「痴子」，我始終不明白表叔對我所下的批評。是否因了恐怕我拆穿他和書記的關係而硬給我這個可怖的罪名呢？</p>
<h3>拿到了救濟費</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>—同舟共濟救濟校工—</p>
<p>轟傳已久的八十萬元救濟費，現在巳水落石出，各校敎師，凡是向當局申請的，大概都領到了一些。這件寨情，遠在去年底寒假時節，中央為體恤上海的敎師，生活艱苦起見，就着手調査，不久便通過以八十萬元的款項，救濟全滬教師。</p>
<p>從此以後，全上海的敎師，都伸長了頸子，期待着這八十萬元的救濟費從速分發。的確，在高物價的今日，敎師已趨於無可生活的地步，得到了這個消息之後，自然要切盼着這筆救濟費早一天可拿到手頭呢！</p>
<p>可是，之後，就消息全無，隔了有四個多月，沒有音訊。這在敎師當然慢慢的要感到失望了，而在這四個多月中，起初還相安無事，後來便大家懷疑起來。加着謠言又不斷的傳來，被人從中用去了　？祗救了一部分學校，大多數的學校是沒有分兒了　？言人人殊，莫衷一是，甚至　傳單，主張以行動表示，一時教育界的空氣，突呈煩　起來。</p>
<p>終於事情是水落石出了，自五月中旬起，這八十萬元，也有人說總數一百四十萬元，開始分發了。但因為公立學校先發，當人家拿到了救濟費時，私立學校敎師沒有拿到，更是覺得恐慌起來。直到最近，私立學校也發放了，心才平靜下來，知道關係方面的確因手續關係，支配需時，才擱到今日的。</p>
<p>我們這班私立學校敎職員，最後得到公事已送來，校長　日去領款，那一天分發的消息時，每天所關心的，差不多全是關於救濟費問題。一天又一天，好容易到了發放的一天，大家到校長室拿到了錢出來，面上表現出一種莫名的欣喜的狀態。因為連得上些年紀的同事，敎過很多年雷，也從來沒有得到這樣的額外收入。</p>
<p>凡是專任敎員，所分得的錢都不能算少，所以大家很高興而感謝中央的大德。接着便打算支配這救濟費的用途。買米，還欠，贖當，添新衣服，各有各的用途。同時，更盼望今後每一個學期，中央能有救濟費分發下來。</p>
<p>接着為了敎師的領到了救濟費，校工們也開始呼籲了。的確，同樣在一個機關裏面，站在一條錢h服務，敎師已得到救濟費，而校工却沒有。事實上，校工們的生活，也正和敎師同樣的苦痛，要求救濟，當然是合與的。</p>
<p>然而這問題多少有些困難，首先，這筆救濟費，當局指定救濟敎職員，校工並沒有列入，如果向當局籲請，中央決不會小題大做，再撥一筆專門救濟校工的款項。那麽敎師們錢拿到了，校工又如何？丟他們在一邊，讓他們看教師拿錢嗎？這當然於心何忍！</p>
<p>每天相處在一起，做同一綫上的工作的人，彼此當然同情的。惟一的方法，祗有抱同舟共濟的態度，由敎師們在救濟費中拿出幾許錢來救濟校工。我們學校　的一夥同事，就決定自動的來救濟校工，誰錢拿得多，就多拿些出來，拿得少便少拿一些日來。</p>
<p>結果，有的十元，有的五元，也有三元，二元，大家很願意的把錢拿出來，湊集了一百多元。分給七八個校工，每人也有十多塊了。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「別提這個，快說下去吧！」其實這也正是玉昆自己的短處，所以他倒很同情趙四。</p>
<p>「這麽一來，我就給他們灌醉了，醉得竟像一頭死猪一樣。第三天也不知道是什麽時候醒的，醒了之後，還不知道他們已做了那樣的好戲；直到袁七爺來吿訴我，三老板在天津害病，要把家裏的東西收拾一下，道才發覺現錢也丟了，存摺和行頭也不見了，連榮金大個子，和另外兩個小混蛋也一起走掉了！這一急可眞險些把我急死—</p>
<p>說到這裏，趙四臉上和頭上的汗，再也不容許他不休息一會了．</p>
<p>「榮奎，金大個子他們這班人，難道都沒有來頭人嗎？」湊他在第二度揩拭汗水的時候，玉崑便挿嘴着這樣問。</p>
<p>「有是有的，可是他們也沒有辦法啊！﹂趙叫搖　他那四五十斤重的腦袋說。「後來還是七爺出的主意，一面開了失單，教我上警察局去報吿，一面打電話上銀行裏去送信，請他們見了在摺不要付錢，最好馬上把人扣……。「那末扣到沒有呢？」玉昆想這倒是一個很好的希望呢！</p>
<p>「可惜已經太近了，一個可以動用的存摺巳給他們提空了，還有二個叫做什麼定時存款，總算沒有動；可是人巳經去過了，他們知道不能動，當然就不會再去啦！」</p>
<p>「這樣說，難道就此　了不成？」一句戲詞，不覺就從玉崑嘴裹衝了出來。</p>
<p>「別性急，還有下文咧！趙四把一柄大葵扇從右手裏遞到了左手　去。「七爺一問情形，知道季兆雄那小子頭一天曾經米過，回去便馬上盤問他，不知兩下怎樣一錯勁兒，七爺竟把那小子做了……！。（一二一）</p>

<h3>US Offers Guarantees to China: Will Abandon Special Privileges in China After the War; Hull and Guo Taiqi Officially Exchange Documents, Mutually Pledging to Promote Trade Freedom and Cultural Cooperation</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that as soon as China regains peace, the United States will take action to abolish consular jurisdiction in China. Hull released the letters exchanged between him and Dr. Guo Taiqi, the former Chinese envoy to the UK and soon-to-be Foreign Minister of China. In the letters, Dr. Guo Taiqi pledged that when China regains peace, it will fully seek greater freedom in international trade and more extensive cultural exchange. Hull said, "We unconditionally believe that the principles we follow with China and other countries (national security and fair dealings among nations) will prevail." Guo wrote to Hull from San Francisco on May 26, expressing his gratitude for the Secretary of State's hospitality and for Hull's announcement of the United States' foreign policy. Guo also said that he hopes the world situation will permit freer trade and broader cultural cooperation among nations. He also said, "When peace is restored, the Chinese government hopes and believes that it can seek the most effective means to implement its own economic policies and its own political and economic relations with foreign countries." Hull replied, "As you know, the United States government and people have a deep interest in the well-being and progress of China. It goes without saying that after China regains peace, the United States will begin to unite with countries enjoying consular jurisdiction in China, to negotiate with the Chinese government in a systematic manner to abolish the last few special rights retained in China." Hull also said, "Our country welcomes and encourages any country to move towards peace, security, stability, fairness, and general well-being through legitimate and orderly steps. The guarantees you have made in your letter regarding China's support for the principle of equal respect in economic relations should have a sound effect during the current world conflict and after the cessation of hostilities. The United States government has an obligation to support the principles that the people believe in," (A United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Exchange of Letters Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Washington: The full text of the letters exchanged between the new Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and the U.S. Secretary of State is as follows: "Letter from Foreign Minister Guo to Hull" (omitted above). "During my recent visit, I was honored to receive your explanation of the attitudes and policies held by the United States on economic and political issues related to the whole world, and I was given a detailed presentation of the attitudes and policies held on political and economic issues related to our two countries. At this time of global turmoil, violence, and deep suffering, hearing your insightful remarks filled me with admiration. You previously made a public statement on July 16, 1937, clarifying the general policy of the United States government. I am familiar with the content of that statement. Therefore, I fully understand the importance of your explanation in our previous talks regarding how your country values the principles of a world legal order, equality of treatment among nations, and the need to realize freer trade and larger-scale cultural exchange among nations. My government shares the same sentiment with your government and hopes that orderly progress can be achieved internationally through agreements. The principles you mentioned will surely be universally accepted and implemented internationally. My government previously sent a note to your government on August 12, 1937, expressing support for the principles listed in your statement of July 16, 1937, and explaining China's policy, which coincided with the views of your government. I believe you will recall this matter. China's position at that time has been clearly stated and has not changed slightly to this day. My country has been fighting for self-defense for nearly four years. For the past four years, the United States government and people have always expressed great friendship and sympathy to the government and people of China. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful for the attitude reforms and actions of the United States government. We also believe that the evolution of our attitude, purpose, and policies is increasingly and completely in line with the United States. Our people must believe that international business relations should not have any discrimination and should further implement the principles of broad cooperation and justice, that is, to faithfully fulfill international treaties and that all international issues should be resolved through peaceful negotiation procedures and free and peaceful negotiation methods."</p>
<p>"Hull's Reply to Foreign Minister Guo" The United States government has decided to welcome and encourage any country that makes requests in a legitimate and orderly manner to promote peace, security, order, fairness, and the welfare of all people. The principles of fairness and equal treatment that your country has decided to support in the economic field, as mentioned in your letter, have a significant impact on the present and after the war. Our country has also decided to follow the policies supported by our people. (A one-day dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Expresses Welcome</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese officials today warmly welcomed the statement by the U.S. Secretary of State that the United States will be prepared to abandon consular jurisdiction after China regains peace. The Chinese side said that this is a concrete proof of the United States' goodwill, sympathy, and belief in the future of China. The Chinese side especially appreciates the timeliness of this gesture by the United States. The Chinese side pointed out that the Nanjing regime had cooperated with Japan to unilaterally abolish consular jurisdiction. Officials here said that if such a plan were to be realized, it would deeply win the hearts of the people for the Nanjing regime. However, the United States is now proposing to achieve the same goal through orderly negotiations, which will surely thwart the Nanjing regime's plan. It is believed that Hull's actions can also refute the Japanese propaganda that the central government has mortgaged China to the United States in order to obtain large-scale American aid, which would inevitably lead China to become a semi-colonial status.</p>
<p>Semi-official sources pointed out that Hull's promise is in accordance with the United States' policy of fulfilling China's desire to achieve international equality. They declared that this policy will greatly increase the friendship between China and the United States and will improve the future prospects for good business relations. Officials also recalled that the United States was the first to sign an agreement with China, granting China tariff autonomy. After commenting on this matter, an official told a United Press reporter, "We believe that the United States will be the first to sign a treaty with China based on complete equality."

<h3>U.S. Senator Norris Issues a Warning: If the U.S. Trusts Japan, It Will Eventually Bring Trouble Upon Itself</h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Norris warned yesterday that the United States must not trust Japan. Even if the U.S. and Japan sign a non-aggression treaty, the possibility of Japan attacking the U.S. is still greater than people imagine. He said that Japan can attack the U.S. at any time because Tokyo has decided on such a plan and Japan is confident of winning. Norris also urged the U.S. to carefully consider Japan and Germany as the U.S.'s biggest enemies and suggested that all ports on the Pacific coast must maintain strong defense forces.

<h3>He Yingqin Gives a Speech: There is Still Fierce Fighting in the Zhongtiao Mountains; He Tells U.S. Reporters That No Rift Will Occur With the Communists; Most of the Chinese Army Is Still Defending Positions in the Mountainous Area of Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Administration General He Yingqin said today that if China wants to win the war against Japan, it must first eliminate the Eighteenth Group Army of the Communist Party. Minister He said in a private meeting with a special correspondent from the United Press that if the Communist Party obeys orders, follows the country's war policy, and abandons all its past illegal activities, such as attacking the Central Army, disobeying Central orders, and issuing currencies, then the central government will not hold them accountable for the past. He also reiterated that President Chiang Kai-shek had recently assured the National Political Council that the government would no longer carry out communist suppression campaigns. Minister He also said that he believes that the Central Army and the Communist Party will not openly break apart because the Communist Party does not dare to openly oppose the government, otherwise, it will be regarded as a traitor assisting Japan and will be abandoned by the people. Minister He said that the Communist Party only needs not to attack friendly forces to prevent Japan from succeeding and to complete the Communist Party's mission. Previously, the Japanese army had four mixed brigades stationed in the Communist Party's defense zone in northern Shanxi, but recently it has transferred most of these troops to southern Shanxi to fight. The central government has had to retain a portion of its elite troops to prevent possible attacks by the Communist Party. If the Communist Party attacks the Japanese army, so that this portion of the Central Army does not need to defend against them, then the Chinese army can fight together, even if the Japanese army increases by ten divisions more than the current number, there is nothing to fear. Minister He also told reporters in detail about the Communist army's attacks on the Central Army, but said that he did not want to publicize this situation because he did not want to provoke division and hostility. Minister He also said that the Chinese army has not completely withdrawn from the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. He said that the Japanese army mobilized six divisions and three brigades, intending to trap the Chinese army in the mountains. Therefore, the Chinese army was divided into two parts: one part crossed the Yellow River and established positions on the south bank, and the other part crossed the Japanese army's rear in the north of the Zhongtiao Mountains. There are still many Chinese troops remaining in the mountainous and rugged areas because the Japanese army only occupies valleys and passes. There is still fierce fighting there, and the fighting is favorable to the Chinese side. When asked about the participation of the Eighteenth Group Army in the war, Minister He replied that General Wei Lihuang, the commander of the war zone, had received a guarantee from the representative of the Eighteenth Group Army stationed in Luoyang that the Communist army would harass the Japanese transportation lines and would participate in the battle of the Zhongtiao Mountains. He said that he had not received a formal report from General Wei Lihuang that the Eighteenth Group Army had implemented its plan. He admitted that he had been repeatedly accused by the Communist Party of being pro-Japanese, but he presented reporters with a piece of political history that had never been known to refute this accusation. He said, "Between 1933 and 1935, I had a very good opportunity to be pro-Japanese in North China. Japan at that time very much wanted China to sign an anti-communist pact and offered me generous terms, saying that if China joined the anti-communist defense line in North China, Japan would abolish all Japanese concessions in China and abolish the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. I refused to consider these terms because Japan wanted to use anti-communism to interfere in China's internal affairs and to make China attack a 'friendly nation,'" (A one-day United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Offensive Fails Again</p>
<p>Chongqing: An editorial in the Central Daily News yesterday morning stated that the Japanese army's summer offensives on all fronts have failed. After a month of fighting on the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts, the Japanese army can only occupy Ningbo and Fuzhou, while Wenzhou, Haimen, and Fuqing have been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in southern Henan and northern Hubei attacked the Chinese army in the Dabie Mountains but suffered heavy losses and was eventually driven back to the original line in Suixian County. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi attacked the Zhongtiao Mountains with a force of 140,000, suffering casualties of up to 40,000. The Chinese army has moved to a new position and is currently launching a counter-offensive in the area of Qinshui, Gaoping, and Jiyuan. The Chinese army in northwestern Shanxi is also attacking Japanese army positions along the Pinghan Railway. The Chinese army in eastern Guangdong is also launching a counter-offensive, recapturing Huiyang and currently besieging Danshui. The failure of the Japanese army's summer offensive has proven that Japan is neither able to penetrate deep into the Chinese mainland nor has sufficient strength to advance southward. (A one-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the road starting from Hongdong along the Tongpu Railway to Tongliu (transliteration), because after the Chinese army moved north from the Zhongtiao Mountains, it is now advancing to the rear of the Japanese army. (A one-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai's Statement</p>
<p>Chongqing: Communist leader Zhou Enlai recently issued a statement responding to accusations that the Communist army has not participated in the current war in Shanxi. Zhou also published a special article in the Xinhua Daily on the Communist Party's views on the international situation. Early this morning, Communist personnel in a special car delivered the newspaper containing the article to the press conference and distributed it to foreign reporters. Zhou responded to the remarks of a Chinese army spokesperson condemning the Communist army for not yet having contact with the Japanese. Since the outbreak of the battle of the Zhongtiao Mountains, the highest command of the Chinese army has inquired about the cooperation of the Communist Party. He (Zhou himself) immediately expressed his opinion that the CCP has always supported the government that continues to resist, so there is no doubt that the Eighteenth Group Army will join the war. Soon after, he received a telegram from Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, the commander and deputy commander of the Eighteenth Group Army, announcing their readiness to cooperate in resisting the war and listing their combat plans. This telegram was immediately submitted to the Supreme Command, which decided that Zhu De and Peng Dehuai should contact the commander-in-chief of the war zone. According to the latest war news received, it has been proven that the Communist army in eastern Shanxi and the Dabie Mountains in northern Shanxi is currently fighting with the Japanese. Zhou claimed that the Communist army is not afraid of the Japanese army and is prepared to fight them on the battlefield. He hopes that the people of the whole country will not be misled by the enemy's propaganda. In his article on the international situation, Zhou said that in the West there is a conspiracy for Britain and Germany to compromise in order to deal with the Soviet Union, and in the East there are rumors of the United States reconciling with Japan (two-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>Chongqing: Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative stationed in Chongqing, declared in the Xinhua Daily today that the most important undercurrent in the Far East is the desire for the United States to come forward to make peace between China and Japan. Zhou said that the Japanese business and diplomatic circles want the United States to mediate the war because President Roosevelt's recent fireside chat did not mention Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka also hope to negotiate directly with the Chongqing government. Zhou said that this kind of undercurrent in the Far East does not shake our determination to fight. On the contrary, this kind of undercurrent will strengthen our will to fight. Zhou also said that the undercurrent in Europe is the desire to establish a British-German joint front to confront the Soviet Union. Hess's flight to England has activated this undercurrent completely. A common anti-Soviet front between London and Berlin has developed rapidly in those two places, but the longer the war drags on, the more the military strength of the Soviet Union will be strengthened.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Far East Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>For some time, there has been an invisible undercurrent in the international community, which, with various gestures, still anticipates the revival of the appeasement policy for the clearly divided current situation in the Far East. Of course, some of them are just baseless rumors of a nerve war nature and are not worth paying attention to, but the intention of some people to separate the Far East issue from the European war due to the serious Nazi threat cannot be ignored either. In addition, after Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned from Europe, he once revealed his fantasies about the United States, and various subtle proposals such as Matsuoka's visit to the United States and the invitation of the US head of state to visit Japan have also been intermittently publicized in newspapers and by the people. The news from the US side that Japan is indifferent to the Axis powers is precisely caused by such impressions, thus creating a fantasy that Japan can be induced to break away from the Axis powers through an appeasement policy. Half a month ago, British Foreign Secretary Eden resolutely explained the British government's Far East policy in the House of Commons. After the publication of Roosevelt's fireside chat, Secretary of State Hull reiterated that the US attitude towards Japan remained unchanged as a supplementary explanation. In fact, the US and British authorities have no doubt about the current Far East policy, and the world should not doubt it either. However, the fact that they have successively engaged in solemn explanations proves that the deep clouds and darkness are noteworthy, and even the US Congress has misinterpreted Roosevelt's firm and clear speech.</p>
<p>As pointed out in this newspaper's editorial yesterday, the attitude expressed by Roosevelt in his fireside chat on the 27th is the most active measure that a non-belligerent country can take. The reason why his condemnation of the crimes of aggression singled out the Nazis and Hitler is only because Germany is the center of gravity of the aggression front, and it is not allowed to be misinterpreted as relaxation or forgiveness for other accomplices and abettors. If Roosevelt really distinguished between the aggressor nations, then Italy should first express relief because the Fascist Party and Mussolini were not mentioned at all in that speech. And his praise for China's war effort and his promise to strengthen aid to China are enough to show his great concern for the Far East. Reducing the Far East issue to the Sino-Japanese War is not the US authorities' avoidance of stimulating Japan, but the current stage of the Far East issue is actually centered on the Sino-Japanese War. The US concern for the Far East is fundamentally defensive rather than offensive. If Japan does not intend to launch a war against the US, or cause the US to suffer a stimulus that it cannot tolerate, the US has no need to fight in the Far East. But this cannot be misinterpreted as an appeasement attempt by the US authorities, just as the US has not declared war on Germany to date cannot be misinterpreted as having illusions about Germany. Those who speculate in this way may be true believers in the appeasement policy. The additional aid to China announced by Roosevelt, if it can meet the objective needs in terms of time and the quality and quantity of equipment, may be more effective in preventing the expansion of the Far East aggression tragedy than the US's direct participation in the Pacific war. Following Hull's statement explaining that the US policy towards Japan remains unchanged, it is reported that the US military has allowed a large number of air force pilots and mechanics to come to China. Hull also stated to Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese Foreign Minister, the day before yesterday that after China's anti-Japanese reconstruction is achieved, the US will begin to unite the countries enjoying consular jurisdiction in China to abolish the last few special rights preserved in China. This indicates that the US aid to China is being expanded and implemented. On the other hand, it also shows the fundamental spirit and position of its policy towards China, which are all incompatible with the appeasement policy.</p>
<p>The so-called appeasement policy has created countless crimes in the international community and indirectly promoted the aggressive war that slaughters mankind and destroys civilization. However, it has not completely disappeared from the international political arena to this day, which is really strange. Perhaps this is the manifestation of human inertia! From the Allies' tolerance of Germany setting up defenses in the Rhineland to the US's recent appeasement of Vichy France, none of them have been successful, and those who have achieved success are almost non-existent. Even in terms of the past in the Far East, before the Tripartite Pact, the appeasement policy had been implemented repeatedly, but the result was only to make the international division in the Far East clearer and the aggressors' greed more rampant. Today, within Japan, there are indeed people who hope to adjust relations with democratic countries, but not to mention whether they have the ability to influence the political situation, even if they really have the possibility of breaking away from the Axis relationship, the price they demand will also be very high. Unless the United States can modify its fundamental position of maintaining justice and resisting aggression, it can be asserted that it will absolutely not be able to accept it. What's more, the radical forces within it still occupy the advantage, and the demand to adjust relations with the United States has gradually been overwhelmed by the voices loyal to the Tripartite Alliance.</p>
<p>Whether the situation in the Pacific will continue to deteriorate depends not only on how US-Japan relations develop but also on the future of the Sino-Japanese War and the Anglo-German War, and the comparison of US-Japan strength. To ensure the peace of the Far East, it is only possible to promote the victory of the Chinese and British war efforts and to increase the proportion of US strength. This is exactly what the US authorities are trying to do at this moment. As for all kinds of other things, they are nothing more than illusory fantasies.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Encourages Compatriots Across the Country to Promote the Savings and Construction Movement</h3>
<p>Chongqing: President Chiang Kai-shek attaches great importance to the launch of the public organization Savings Practice Association by the National Savings Association. He recently sent a circular telegram commending the people for regular savings. The original telegram is as follows: The National Regular Construction Savings Committee, to all party, government, and military chiefs across the country, and to all comrades working under their jurisdiction and to compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese, for your information. Since the launch of the regular national construction savings movement, compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese have responded enthusiastically, and the total amount of savings has surged, which shows that our compatriots share the purpose of this movement and follow it enthusiastically, which is deeply gratifying. Because the savings movement, on the one hand, collects the people's financial resources, which is necessary to complete modern construction, and on the other hand, it encourages thrift and savings, which is an important plan for reviving the country and the nation. In the near term, it can supplement the supply of the front-line combat and promote the stability of the rear economy. In the long term, it can develop the resources and reserves of the country and consolidate the foundation of people's livelihood. All of these must be taken from regular savings, and they can be implemented step by step. Looking at any wartime country in the world today, the income they collect from the people is at least 50% to 60% or more, and the lives of the people they control have strict restrictions on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Compared with our country, the difference is very large. We should know to be alert. In the future, our party, government, and military comrades, as well as compatriots across the country, should, in promoting thrift and savings, base themselves on the concept of voluntary action, regard it as a way to establish themselves, make twice the efforts, practice it faithfully, from home and abroad, from cities and villages, all those who are Chinese, regardless of old or young, male or female, should follow the instructions issued by Zhongzheng in the past, consolidate the foundation and cultivate the yuan, and do not stop for a moment, and actively participate in the Savings Practice Association, encourage each other, and persevere without changing. Turn consumption into practical use, and accumulate little by little. Considering the vast territory and large population of our country, with the concerted efforts of the masses, the results will be great, and the future of the Anti-Japanese Construction will be deeply benefited. I have high hopes for this. Zhongzheng You (26th) Shichuan, (31st dispatch)</p>

It is reported that the situation in Baghdad has now returned to normal. (First, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: According to Baghdad news received by Vichy, since the British army and the Iraqi rebel army signed an armistice agreement, the war in Iraq has now stopped. It is reported that the armistice agreement came into effect from 6 pm on Saturday. It is reported that after Rashid Ali and several of his cabinet members and many military officers fled to Iran, several German planes withdrew from Iraq. It is reported that the Italian Minister and his entourage stationed in Baghdad have fled to Iran. After the Baghdad Mayor's organization of a four-member committee took over the administration of the city, it proposed an armistice request. According to the mayor, Regent Ilah should enter Baghdad immediately after the terms of the armistice are agreed upon to organize a constitutional government to restore peace and independence in Iraq. This is public opinion. The armistice negotiations took place all day on Friday. At that time, a military officer commanding the rebel army near Baghdad personally went to the British camp with a white flag to negotiate peace. This was the result of the Baghdad Mayor's negotiations with the British Ambassador, and the British Ambassador advised the Iraqi rebel army to open peace talks with the British Commander. After the armistice agreement was signed, Baghdad issued a public notice announcing that the situation had returned to normal, saying that this agreement guaranteed the unity and independence of Iraq, and asking the public to immediately go about their business as usual. The blackout has been lifted, but curfew is still in effect after 9 pm.

<p>Rome: Furthermore, Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaida, published an article in the Italian Daily stating that the Italian army's landing at the east port of Crete made it very convenient for the German army to occupy Candia. The Battle of Crete can be said to be the most important battle in the Mediterranean, but the trend of the war was initially uncertain. While the German and British troops were fighting fiercely in the west of the island, the Italian army landed in the east of the island, immediately forming a new Italian-British front. After the Italian army launched a fierce battle with the British army, the brave German army advanced rapidly and occupied Candia. However, although Crete is an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, it is not our final goal, as the island is only the prelude to the great Mediterranean war. (First, United Press)</p>
<p>Sydney: Australian Land Minister Spender stated yesterday that the situation on Crete is indeed very serious. British Commonwealth troops and Greek soldiers are now fighting to the death, inflicting heavy damage on German troops, but the situation will become even tighter in the next few days.

<p>Berlin: According to official announcements here, after the important bases of the British army on Crete fell one after another, their resistance has collapsed. Small teams of enemy troops are now being chased by German troops. The German mountain troops advanced 65 kilometers in two days. It is commendable that the German paratroopers were able to maintain their position for eight days before reinforcements arrived. A portion of the British army is now waiting for small boats on the south coast to evacuate. (First, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the latest reports here, the British troops withdrawing from Crete have lost their last chance to dig trenches and defend themselves. The German News Agency stated that while the Germans are pursuing the British troops on land, their planes are dropping bombs, and the British troops are now concentrated on the south coast of the island, waiting for ships to cross the sea, but their hope of escape is slim.

<h3>British Ships Continue Search for Prinz Eugen</h3>
<p>London: The German ten-thousand-ton cruiser Prinz Eugen, eight days after leaving the Bismarck, is still being searched for by the British Navy. British ships and planes that pursued the Bismarck are now speeding across thousands of miles of the Atlantic Ocean to track it down. It is widely believed that this large German ship is fleeing to the Soviet port of Murmansk, or Dakar, or another port in French West Africa. (First, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Germany Plots to Control Eastern End of the Mediterranean, but Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term Due to Excessive Consumption of Opening Force</h3>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph published a special article by diplomatic reporter Lennox, stating that Germany is now concentrating its efforts to control the eastern end of the Mediterranean. They rely on the Vichy government's decision to oppose the continuation of the struggle from the vast French North African territories, so they have gained a supremely advantageous position in the center or waist, and with the help of Spain, they can achieve the same results with Gibraltar. This achievement can indeed enable Germany to control the North African coast, but the date of realization is still far away. The consumption of the German military's opening force is actually greater than generally recognized, but it is not fully consumed. According to neutral sources within Germany, this trend seems to have emerged now. Therefore, we must be able to anticipate that one day in the future, the Allied Navy and its friends and comrades will start attacking the enemy from the edge of the battlefield again. Their air force will continue to bomb the center of the violent country with bombs. Even on land, the Allied land forces may be able to contain the German advance. When the position of encircling the enemy army is created, it can be believed that the main force will be on the side of those who defend the freedom of the world. The Iraqi rebels' request for a ceasefire is of great importance, not only making it easier for Britain to restore order in that important Arab country, but also consolidating the attitude of other anti-Axis countries, and thereby making it easier to contain the Axis countries' plan to control the Near East. However, now that Germany is disappointed in Iraq, it will definitely increase its activities in the neighboring country of Iran. At the same time, the US government is still discussing with General Weygand in order to obtain a compromise and guarantee that the necessary goods will be continuously transported to North Africa, hoping to prevent the Germans from penetrating deep into North Africa. It is now believed that these talks are progressing very satisfactorily. However, according to recent news, the Vichy government has transported a large number of weapons to North Africa. I do not know if they will be used to recapture the land of Free France in West Africa and Equatorial Africa. According to recent rumors, Darlan has reached an understanding with Germany and will allow Hitler to obtain vast French colonies in Africa, including Cameroon. (First, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Vichy Shamelessly Serves the Enemy, US to Send Warning Note, Declaring Future US Attitude Towards France, Depends on Vichy's Actual Actions, Darlan Leaves No Stone Unturned in Slandering Britain</h3>
<p>Washington: It was learned here yesterday that the State Department is currently drafting a formal note to Vichy, informing them that the US's future attitude will depend on Vichy's actual actions, not empty words. It was also learned that the State Department will write a transcript of Secretary of State Hull's conversation with French Ambassador to the US, Haitian Henry, regarding French-German cooperation. The note will also express pessimistic concern about the Axis countries' use of Syria, and reject France's excuses, since if Syria is a mandate territory and not a colony, the French-German armistice agreement cannot be applied to Syria. (First, United Press)</p>
<p>Paris: Cabinet Assistant Darlan recently gave a lengthy speech to reporters here, strongly refuting the claim by British propaganda agencies that France's ability to be saved depends on British victory, saying, "If the world today is a world of Anglo-Saxon victory, then France will only be reduced to the position of a second-class autonomous territory and will no longer be able to shoulder any glorious tasks. Moreover, if we take a passive attitude and wait for British victory, then the price to be paid will be to drive the country to complete destruction. I and Marshal Pétain are unwilling to accept this destructive policy, and the Marshal has ordered me to promote a policy of revival. Under these circumstances, it is natural that I become the target of British anger, and it is inevitable that the British authorities will re-adopt the policies they pursued in the era of the Great Revolution and Napoleon, treating France as 'the Irish of the Continent' or even an ordinary colony. However, the goal of my work is to restore France to its inherent position in Europe and the entire world. Therefore, I must participate in the construction of a new order and must try to accelerate the realization of peace, because while British imperialism needs war to destroy Europe, France needs peace to survive. In any case, I will fulfill my responsibilities. The day after the incident at the port of Sfax, what I want to say is to reiterate my determination. In other words, I will make others respect France's right to freely use its ports and transportation lines. It should be known that although France has been defeated, it will never allow others to use violence against its territory or insult its flag.</p>
<p>143 Ships Detained</p>
<p>Since the date of our country's armistice, no fewer than 143 of our country's ships have been detained by the British. The British Navy disregards international law, and when it encounters French ships, it has arbitrarily changed the right to intercept and interrogate into the right to detain them directly. Even if the intercepted ship is an empty ship, it is detained horizontally. From this, it can be seen that Britain's purpose is to implement a pirate war against us, so that the French people will starve to death on the one hand, and to replenish its increasing number of sunken merchant ships on the other. Moreover, for self-defense, Britain often falsely accuses us. One day it accuses us of supplying Germany and Italy from the sea, and the next day it accuses us of transporting military supplies. In fact, the purpose of all these violent acts is to eliminate France's shipping capacity, cut off the connection between mainland France and its colonies, and isolate us from the world. Since last June, Britain has detained a total of 82 French merchant ships, totaling 370,000 tons, taken over 10 of our ships, totaling 36,000 tons, in the colonies occupied by our country's rebels, and intercepted 33 of our ships, totaling 158,000 tons, at sea. Later, it blocked 13 of our ships in the United States, totaling 142,000 tons. Apart from this, there are still some French ships that were either bombed, torpedoed, or sunk themselves due to the threat of the central ship. The above totals no less than 792,000 tons, worth a total of 12 billion francs. This loss is even greater than the supply fees that our country has paid to the German army since the armistice. "</p>
<p>Recalling the Past, Being Fooled by Britain</p>
<p>Darlan then recounted the two decisions on the British ship attacking the ports of Oran and Dakar. He was truly saddened by the fact that the French main ship "Dunkirk" was hit by a torpedo on July 7 last year, and said, "In view of this kind of fact, I don't understand why the British government would treat its former allies like this, why it must starve French women and children, why it must destroy the material and spiritual power of France, why it supports the propaganda work of French separatists in London with huge sums of money, and why it repeatedly decides to instigate the rebellion of soldiers in French colonies. Looking back since the Great War, Britain has destroyed the peace that we had signed with Germany, and promoted Turkey to send troops to Silesia, causing disputes between that country and us. The goal of Britain's policy towards Germany was to isolate us. In 192, Britain again supplied the rebels in Morocco and Syria with money and weapons. At every international conference held over the years, Britain has always sacrificed France's interests to expand its power. In 1935, Britain encouraged France to impose sanctions on Italy. When the German army reoccupied the Rhine area, Britain did not give us the convenience to fight back on the one hand, and did everything possible to prevent us from conducting direct talks with Germany on the other. In a nutshell, looking at the Anglo-French diplomatic relations from 1919 to 1939, it can be said that every time France appealed to Britain, it was rejected, but every time Britain wanted to defend its interests, France would always willingly help it. In 1938, British Prime Minister Chamberlain was unwilling to pay attention to the Czech incident. By 1939, Britain encouraged us to intervene in the Polish incident, which is one example. From this, it can be seen that the reason why Britain constantly attacks us with cruel methods is actually in accordance with its consistent political policy. In other words, it wants to bankrupt Europe so that Britain can dispose of it at will. Only in this way, every time we decide to unify the European continent, Britain will secretly or openly attack us. Every time we decide to establish an agreement with a country, Britain and the pro-British faction in our country will oppose it in the League of Nations. It was not until Germany rose to become an important factor in unifying the European continent that Britain suddenly became loyal to its obligations to the French alliance and used our country's ignorant politicians, under the guise of justice and freedom, to drive us into war. In short, Britain's current policy is to prevent France from participating in the new European order, that is, to prevent France from maintaining its territorial integrity and unity."

<h3>America Prepares for War: Overview of Military Aircraft Production. 500,000 Men and Women Work in Various Factories; Average Monthly Production Reaches 1,600 Aircraft</h3>
<p>New York – The U.S. Air Force has replaced the fleet as the first line of defense in the Western Hemisphere. As such, the development of the aviation industry, in terms of the number of employees and the value of production, can rival the steel, automotive, and construction industries without falling short. By 1941, 500,000 men and women will be working in U.S. aircraft factories. The area occupied by aircraft manufacturing plants amounts to 50 million square feet, and the monthly production of military aircraft exceeds 1,600. Among the twenty major manufacturing plants, the Curtiss-Wright factory alone employs over 90,000 workers, manufacturing machines, bombers, training aircraft, and pursuit aircraft. Total orders have already exceeded 50,000 military aircraft, and within weeks, this number may increase to 65,000, necessitating the expansion of factories and the workforce. Financially, this undertaking burdens every man, woman, and child in both Britain and America with considerable expenses. In round numbers, the current unfulfilled orders amount to 50 million U.S. dollars, and this figure may increase substantially before the end of the war. In short, this represents the most rapid development of any industry in world history, proving President Roosevelt’s determination to make America the arsenal of democracy. Although America is actively participating in the war, the quality of its aircraft surpasses or equals that of any foreign aircraft. Its military aircraft have self-sealing fuel tanks and are equipped with armor plating to protect the crew. They also boast .50 caliber machine guns capable of penetrating armor, power-operated turrets, and superior firepower. Besides the Curtiss P-40, Bell P-39, Lockheed P-38 pursuit aircraft, and the Vought XF4U Corsair naval dive bomber capable of flying 400 miles per hour, American aircraft designers have also invented the long-range Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24, as well as the Douglas DB-7 and A-20 attack bombers, which are the fastest and most formidable bombers in the world. The most significant achievement is the 70-ton, 8,000-horsepower Douglas B-19 bomber, capable of traversing the Atlantic Ocean without stopping. U.S. Army Air Corps Commander General Arnold recently declared that the outcome of the war would be determined by the nation that first builds a bomber fleet with a 10,000-mile range. Long-range fighters and bombers are specialties of American manufacturers. American-made clipper seaplanes, patrol bombers, and transport aircraft all hold major records for speed, range, and endurance. The aircraft industry confidently acknowledges Ford’s claim that it can produce 1,000 complex, high-speed military aircraft daily. Future production will increase dramatically, but it will not exceed 50,000 military aircraft annually by 1944. If the current number of aircraft types can be reduced to three or four, the production quantity will naturally increase significantly, but it is unlikely to be reduced to that extent. It is believed that strict standardization can reduce the number of aircraft types to forty. Thanks to modern efficiency methods, the creation of new designs has been greatly accelerated. Experts at Vultee have streamlined the technical procedures, reducing the time required to produce a new design from 24 months to 10 months. Previously, it took 15 months of testing before the government would approve a new aircraft design. Now, manufacturers only need to submit a preliminary design with engineering estimates (taking only two months), and the government will immediately authorize the construction of the first aircraft in writing. By the end of the fourth month, actual construction is underway. The current standard method of manufacturing aircraft is to produce the wings, fuselage, and other components separately and then assemble them in one factory. This allows the work to be distributed among aerospace manufacturers nationwide. Previously, the aircraft industry was concentrated on the East and West Coasts, but recently, inland cities such as St. Louis, Indianapolis, Bidetroit, Louisville, and Tulsa have also seen the establishment of large aircraft factories. Southern California has the advantage that, due to the weather, complex work can be done outdoors. As for the method of delivering aircraft ordered by foreign countries, long-range aircraft will be “flown over.” This correspondent heard at the Lockheed factory in California that Hudson bombers could fly themselves to England within a week of leaving California, but smaller aircraft such as pursuit aircraft and interceptors have limited range and must be transported by cargo ships.

Maxwell also stated that export controls in the Philippines have been expanded due to Chickering's trip to the Philippines. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japan's "Jiji Shimpo" stated today that the implementation of U.S. export control regulations in the Philippines directly hinders the normal flow of commerce and urged Filipinos to make every effort to abolish the regulations. The newspaper often represents the views of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. It is claimed that the immediate impact of the export control regulations is to force the value of copra down from 11 Philippine pesos per picul to 7 Philippine pesos. The newspaper said, "Philippine markets rely on Japan. Last year, all steel and iron exported from the Philippines were shipped to Japan, and over 60 percent of steelmaking materials were shipped to Japan, while over 27 percent of Manila hemp was shipped to Japan. These items are likely to be affected by export restrictions, but those who plant copra and palm oil for export will suffer greatly. Through years of trade, Japan has established the right to obtain these products. Japan is not currently at war with the United States. Under these circumstances, prohibiting the export of these supplies is extremely infuriating. Even if the United States absorbs these products itself, it is subsidizing the Philippines with an unjust system to compensate them for refusing to trade with Japan. In short, the whole thing is wrong. It is the root cause of this war and the general unrest in the world. If the Philippines wants to continue doing business with its old customer Japan, they should not tolerate disguised blockade measures." (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Seven U.S. Aid-China Groups Form Joint Organization. Stalled Trade Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies Could Be a Fuse for a Pacific War. American Pilots and Mechanics Have Set Off for Chongqing.</h3>
<p>The general situation in the Far East is still peaceful. The only disruptive factor at present is the trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia, which have reached a standstill. Tokyo claims that the Dutch East Indies authorities are "lacking sincerity" in conducting the negotiations, but the Dutch East Indies claims that the negotiations have stalled due to the Japanese side. Therefore, the outcome of this dispute may quietly end without resolution. However, this dispute is also a fuse for a Pacific war, so it is still impossible to predict how its future development will unfold.</p>
<p>American Pilots Volunteer for China</p>
<p>At the end of last week, a reliable source in Washington issued an important message, stating that the U.S. War Department has authorized pilots and mechanics to voluntarily resign from the Army Air Corps in order to come to China to serve. U.S. Army Department officials are unwilling to comment on this news, but according to general reports, several American pilots and mechanics have set off for China to go to Chongqing in order to fly fighter jets and transport aircraft in China. However, if American pilots and mechanics come to China but do not have aircraft to fly, they will be useless heroes. But on the other hand, now that they have come to China, there is no doubt that American aircraft, including the famous Flying Fortress, must have been or are about to be shipped to China.</p>
<p>Aid-China Groups Form Joint Organization</p>
<p>U.S. aid-China groups are expanding relief efforts and providing aid to China, and are now more enthusiastic than ever. Since President Roosevelt strongly advocated for aid to China with determination, seven other U.S. organizations, including the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the China Emergency Relief Committee, the United China Relief, the American Committee for Chinese War Orphans, the Church Committee for China Relief, the American Committee for Industrial Cooperatives, and the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, have formed a joint organization to expand activities and fundraising, popularize the actual strength of aid to China throughout the United States, and accelerate aid to China. The joint group was initiated this past spring and officially established in April. The period of activity will last until the end of July, launching a fundraising campaign for 5 million U.S. dollars in aid-China relief funds.</p>
<p>Establishment Process and Organizational Overview</p>
<p>According to the declaration of the organizational overview of the joint organization, since July 1937, Americans have seen China fighting for independence and freedom with a firm will and excellent results, so their friendly feelings towards China have further transformed into admiration and sympathy. Secondly, the United States deeply knows that China is not only fighting for its own independence, but also the first line of defense to stop other countries from extending aggressive forces to the Western and Southern Pacific regions, so sympathy for China is self-evident.</p>
<p>The general American public generally believes that the United States has some shame and guilt towards China because weapons of certain aggressive countries are taken from the United States, so the aid-China sentiment is becoming increasingly high and reaching a fever pitch. In action, several aid-China groups have been established one after another. Most of the work is fundraising and donating to relieve China or support China's construction, such as medical aid to China and funding industrial cooperatives. However, they are each operating independently without a centralized organization. Now, in order to obtain contact and achieve efficiency with half the effort, the organization is named the United China Relief.</p>
<p>List of Personnel Responsible for the Federation</p>
<p>According to the Federation's declaration, the joint aid-China objective of the seven aid-China groups is that "the organization wants to use this organization to allow the seven American groups that are enthusiastic about China's relief and revival work to unite their efforts, expand activities and fundraising, spread throughout the United States, and increase the actual strength of aid to China." The Federation was established on April 1 and is scheduled to carry out large-scale and extensive fundraising activities in those four months until July 31. The purpose is to concentrate efforts and raise 5 million U.S. dollars to aid China. The selection of responsible personnel for the Federation has been decided: White Baerner (Chairman of Marine Midland Trust Company) will serve as Chairman, Vice Chairman will be Xibba Nabard (General Secretary of the YMCA), Chief Financial Officer is Gates (Chairman of New York Trust Company), and Directors are Wilkie, Breed, Hoffman, Lamont, Roos, John Rockefeller, Selsnick, Spool, and Ms. Pearl Buck.

<h3>Joint Defense in May Was Successful; Vigilance Has Not Been Relaxed.</h3>

However, for the sake of the overall order and security of the concession, although the joint defense has ended, it will continue to implement meticulous vigilance. All illegal gatherings, associations, marches, demonstrations, and other activities are still strictly prohibited. Roadside inspections will also not be stopped.</p>
<h3>Thank-You Poem for Mr. Miao Yonglou's Birthday</h3>
<p>Mr. Miao Yonglou has been traveling in Shanghai for forty years and has made many contributions in the transportation and finance industries. This year he is celebrating his sixtieth birthday. Now that material resources are difficult and the pain of the wounds is all around, he has written a thank-you poem for his birthday because his high hall is prosperous. His relatives and clansmen initiated a vegetarian banquet to celebrate his birthday on the ninth day of the fifth lunar month at Xiyuan Temple on Aiwenyi Road. Here is the thank-you poem: What age is this now, how dare I celebrate? And my year is only the age of sixty, less old than in the East. The year before last was my mother's eightieth birthday, and I have not yet celebrated. I wanted to decide to return home early to entertain my mother. But the thorns cover the ground, and the merciful command is not to return home. I welcome visitors in vain, and the golden daylily loves the hometown catalpa. I lean on the dilapidated fence, and my eyes are sore and it is difficult to travel. The orphaned old Five Phoenixes, the colorful wings were broken in three lines. My knees are just weak crowns, and I hope to do a lot. Strict admonition and cautious choice, it is difficult to avoid imitating Ji Liang. My two nephews have been given a job, when will I see them soar? I think of myself as useless, and I have no length to choose talents. Therefore, I will set up a public banquet, and I will set up about three chapters. The guests are not widely distributed, and the auditorium is not covered. There are precedents for hundreds of miles, and the meal fee is limited to five sheep. Love me to leave mudprints, and the crown is collected in the movie. Take the spirit of joy, and give up the brilliance of the material. Use this to spend the first day, don’t laugh at the unprecedented. Everything can be improved, and what is the matter with the grass? Looking around at the disturbances, the wild geese need benevolent soup. Saving food to live in the world is better than birthday people. In a few years, God will add me, and the world will be righteous. My mother is ninety years old, and the conference will be drunk.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Memorial Ceremony for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Burial: All Circles Increased Loyalty</h3>
<p>Comply with the Wishes of the Deceased: Work Hard in Their Positions and Strive for Freedom and Equality for the Country and the Nation</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's burial. Although all circles in Shanghai did not hold memorial ceremonies due to the special circumstances, in order to comply with the wishes of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and strive for national freedom and equality, they decided to sincerely support national policies, work hard in their positions, and complete the great cause of national rejuvenation to comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow Is Anti-Smoking Day: Promote the Anti-Drug Movement</h3>
<p>The Poisonous Atmosphere Is Mired in Shanghai, and the Suffering of Tobacco Is Rampant. Citizens Should Know to Be Vigilant and Comply with National Policies</p>
<p>Tomorrow (June 3) is the memorial day for Lin Wenzhong (Xu) burning opium at Humen in Guangzhou. The National Government has stipulated that it is Anti-Smoking Day, and has ordered all localities to eliminate the scourge of tobacco within a time limit in order to revitalize the national spirit and implement the anti-smoking policy. However, the poisonous atmosphere in Shanghai is pervasive, and the suffering of tobacco is rampant, causing the wish for three years of rural tobacco and five years of drug prohibition to be shattered. Last month, the Ministry of Law re-distributed strict laws and regulations in order to make a passive resistance. On this Anti-Smoking Day, we cannot help but be deeply vigilant. Citizens are determined to abide by national policies, unanimously promote the anti-drug movement, and advise friends and relatives who are addicted to tobacco to wake up as soon as possible, make up their minds and quit immediately, so as to save expenses and restore a healthy body. If there are strong citizens, there will be a strong country. The First and Second Branch of the High Court are scheduled to burn confiscated tobacco and drug utensils tomorrow to promote it.</p>
<h3>Sailed into American Military Zone: Japanese Military Vehicle Intercepted, Three Pistols Found Onboard, Senior Officials From Both Sides Negotiated a Resolution</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, within the American military zone of the Public Concession, another incident occurred where a Japanese military vehicle carrying weapons drove through, leading to an interception by American defense forces. The situation became quite tense. Later, after Japanese officials arrived to explain the misunderstanding, the incident was resolved.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Vehicle Carrying Weapons</p>
<p>It is understood that the section of Yu Qiaqing Road west of the Public Concession is the defense area of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy. In the past, due to Japanese troops carrying weapons and entering the area without authorization, the Japanese authorities guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur again, and the matter was resolved. Unexpectedly, yesterday at approximately 8:30 AM, another Japanese military vehicle, identified as number 365, carrying a Japanese military police officer, two guards in plainclothes, and a driver, drove eastward from Shanghai West into the American defense zone of Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, American defense forces discovered that the vehicle was carrying two packages of weapons, but due to the Japanese military vehicle's rapid speed, they were unable to intercept it in time.</p>
<p>Chasing and Intercepting Creates Tense Situation</p>
<p>Subsequently, three members of the McKinley team's patrol squad urgently chased after it on three-wheeled motorcycles at high speed. They caught up with the vehicle in front of the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. The American military vehicle immediately stopped to intercept and attempted to inspect it. However, the Japanese military police officers refused to be inspected, leading to a standoff. Both sides called their respective units for assistance. Subsequently, the Japanese military police corps dispatched a vehicle with two military police officers and one military police assistant, arriving in front of the Grand Theater. After negotiations, no resolution was reached, and the standoff continued, creating a highly tense situation.</p>
<p>Senior Officials Negotiated at the Scene</p>
<p>Before long, American defense forces also dispatched a military officer and three soldiers in a vehicle. At the same time, the Public Concession Police Department received a report and dispatched a Japanese detective and other Western detectives to the scene. They confirmed that each Japanese military police officer was carrying three pistols, while the driver did not have any weapons. At that time, another Japanese vehicle carrying three plainclothes personnel (personnel from the Japanese Consulate) arrived at the scene and negotiated with the American defense forces. Subsequently, the Japanese military vehicle number 365 was allowed to return, and the American defense forces took the Japanese plainclothes personnel to the American military headquarters for a resolution. According to reports from the Social News Agency, when the American and Japanese officials arrived, they confirmed that the vehicle did indeed contain three pistols, belonging to the Japanese military police officer and two Japanese soldiers. They immediately ordered the vehicle to leave, thus ending the dispute.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Repeatedly Selling Hong Kong Rice Attempting To Smuggle It Abroad, Ordering and Sales of Tribute Rice Must Be Registered, Some Rice Merchants Are Treacherous and Should Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Local foreign firms recently received a telegram from colleagues in Vietnam stating that the Vietnamese harvest season is about to begin. Due to even rainfall during the planting season, a bountiful harvest is expected. According to rice industry sources, a certain rice firm also received a telegram from Hong Kong colleagues yesterday stating that the Vietnamese government has approved large-scale shipments of high-quality tribute rice to Shanghai to alleviate shortages, now that the new harvest is about to begin. The rice merchants, upon receiving the telegram, are actively preparing to place large orders. According to shipping industry sources, there will be no shortage of vessels required to transport the tribute rice, and the shipping costs may continue to decrease. Therefore, the cost for rice merchants to purchase foreign rice will become lower.</p>
<p>Rice Registration to Eliminate Speculation</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have scheduled rice stock registration to thoroughly stabilize the food supply for the population, which has received widespread praise from all sectors. It is believed that the authorities' implementation of this measure is a warning to speculators, who will no longer be able to operate freely. Yesterday, this reporter visited the official in charge and asked how the authorities would implement this measure. The official stated that the authorities deeply believe that if rice prices are not urgently suppressed, it will be difficult to ensure social order. Therefore, stabilizing the food supply is a firm resolution. Although suggestions for rice registration and other measures were made to the authorities earlier, the matter is of great importance and was delayed until now. The authorities' rice registration is an essential part of stabilizing the food supply. The efforts to improve the situation depend on the continued efforts of the rice industry associations, and the authorities will not hesitate to provide assistance. At the same time, the authorities will not be negligent in the registration of rice, and will handle it strictly.</p>
<p>Sales of Tribute Rice Must Be Reported</p>
<p>Yesterday, information was received from the rice industry that the French Concession authorities, in order to control the transportation and sales of tribute rice in the city and prevent hoarders from raising prices, have established a working committee and stipulated that all matters relating to the ordering, transportation, and sale of tribute rice in the city must be registered in advance. The rice industry states that although the sales volume and prices in the rice market are registered daily, the quantity of goods received and ordered is not yet registered. Therefore, they are awaiting formal notification from the authorities before the rice industry groups discuss how to implement the registration.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit The Transportation of Hong Kong Rice To Other Areas</p>
<p>The person continued that the Shanghai Municipal Council's purchase of large quantities of Yangon special small-grained rice from the Hong Kong government at any cost is not only of excellent quality, but also has a lower price than other types of rice. Therefore, citizens of all social classes are vying to purchase the rice. According to reports from the handling foreign firms, the amount of this foreign rice that has been transported to Shanghai has exceeded half of the monthly supply, and the amount sold has also far exceeded half of what has been transported to Shanghai, approximately 100,000 bags. The authorities' purchase of Hong Kong rice and its sale in Shanghai is aimed at stabilizing the food supply and helping the common people. However, some rice merchants with ulterior motives are transporting the rice to other areas for sale, making greater profits. They dare to resell Hong Kong rice on the market, attempting to transport it out. The authorities will strictly prohibit this. In the future, those who sell Hong Kong rice must accurately report the daily sales volume of Hong Kong rice to Jardine Matheson and China Merchants Steam Navigation, and must not conceal the facts to prevent corruption.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection of Rice Exports</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person familiar with the rice market told this reporter that if there were no speculation and continued hoarding by large households, the price of rice in the city would have fallen below 100 yuan. However, recently the price of rice has not only failed to decline, but has instead seen a high peak. The market situation is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and people are still uneasy. According to what he knows, there are currently one or two rice firms attempting to hoard large quantities of spot goods in the city to transport them to Macau, Hangzhou, Fujian, Haimen, and other places for profit. Every time they are about to do business on the market, holders take the opportunity to hoard, and the prices of various types of rice not only fail to decline but are instead frequently raised. When these people apply to the authorities for removal permits, they fabricate various reasons in the hopes of gaining the authorities' trust. They then use the removal permits to transport high-quality rice to other areas by truck. Therefore, what is urgently needed to be implemented now is to limit the amount of goods that can be traded on the market each day, and the authorities should strictly inspect rice transportation.</p>
<h3>Business Employees Refused To Accept Dismissal Compensation</h3>
<p>The labor unrest at the Commercial Press has been deadlocked for more than a month. The management still insists on the original plan to lay off employees, and mediation has yielded no results. It is reported that more than 600 employees have been laid off or reassigned, accounting for more than half of the total number of employees. After receiving letters from the authorities, the laid-off employees were dispersed by detectives. At that time, the police station promised to mediate and provide a response in three days, but the result was also ineffective. The Commercial Press authorities entrusted lawyer Wang Yaotang to issue six months of compensation to the dismissed employees, as well as half a month's salary for May and wages for statutory holidays from January to May. It is understood that the colleagues at the Commercial Press are still trying their best to resume work and are unwilling to accept the compensation. In recent days, a small number of colleagues went to the aforementioned location to receive half a month's salary for May but were rejected.</p>

<h3>Major Robbery at the Post Office, Thugs Discovered The Same Day, Chauffeur Said It Was Driven To Shikoku Road, Because It Is A Japanese Residence, It Was Not Suitable For Search, Police Station Will Conduct Investigation With Japanese Military Police</h3>
<p>The Yu Lin West Newspaper reported that at around 9:30 yesterday morning (the 31st), a major robbery occurred in broad daylight. At the time, one Chinese and one Japanese person took a business car to the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration to rob 2.5 million yuan and escape. It is generally believed that a chauffeur, who was in the business car, has been arrested by the Public Concession Police Department, and will be transferred to the Japanese Military Police for investigation. The most surprising aspect of the case is that the robbers did not use weapons, and the post office workers and managers mistakenly believed that the robbers were post office employees, and allowed them to do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Japanese Drive Away With Ease</p>
<p>According to the head of the postal accounting section, Mr. Green, when the robbers appeared, the huge sum of money was divided into ten bags, and was being transported into an armored truck by four coolies, who were supervised by a postal worker. At that time, the robbers suddenly arrived in a green car with Concession license number 5152 and City license number 655. After getting out of the car, one of them (the Japanese) spoke to the postal worker in Japanese, and the postal worker thought that the Japanese was sent by the Japanese authorities to conduct investigations or searches, so he told another Chinese person to report to the writing room. At that time, the Japanese person and the Chinese person who came with him moved the huge sum of money into the car they came in, and as everyone was surprised, the Japanese person and his Chinese accomplice drove away quickly. At this point, the postal worker, coolies, and bodyguards present realized that they had been robbed, so they called the police to chase and arrest them, but the robbers had disappeared long ago.</p>
<p>Police Investigate and Detain the Driver</p>
<p>They immediately reported it to the police and the Japanese authorities. After investigation by the Hongkou police, it was discovered that the car the robbers were in belonged to the Shengda Automobile Company in Hongkou, and the driver was immediately detained. According to the driver's statement at the police station, a Japanese person and a Chinese person came to rent a car that morning and told him to drive to the post office. After the post office loaded ten bags of parcels, they asked him to drive to a house on Shikoku Road, paid the fare and left, he said. When the detective took the driver to Shikoku Road for an on-site investigation, but after arriving there, it was discovered that the house pointed to by the driver was where the Japanese military authorities lived. At this point, the detective had no right to enter, so he had to stop the investigation and transfer the entire case to the Japanese military police for handling. The driver was also handed over to the Japanese military police for questioning. Yesterday, informed sources believed that there may have been an inside line in the post office for the incident, otherwise the robbers would not have been able to rob the huge sum of money and escape so calmly.</p>
<p>The Thugs Claimed to be Sent by The Japanese</p>
<p>It is said that the stolen money was sent by the post office in Hong Kong and was intended to be used to build a new house for the Nanjing post office. Because the bank was closed on Friday, it was kept in the post office until yesterday, when it was planned to be sent to the postal savings and remittance bureau for storage. According to a post office official, the Japanese person who robbed the money claimed to the postal worker supervising the coolies that he was sent by the Japanese authorities. At the time, the Japanese person and his Chinese accomplices did not show any guns, and apparently succeeded in their plan by deceiving others, so investigators believe that the robbers may not have been armed, which is also possible.</p>
<h3>Major Casinos in Shanghai West Are About To Merge</h3>
<p>The reason for the closure is said to be losses, and a new gambling den will open soon</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the three major casinos in Shanghai West, the Hotel des Colonies, the Chinese General Association, and the United Overseas Chinese General Association, all closed at 3:00 AM yesterday (the 31st) in accordance with Pan Dazhi's order. However, the France and Yewen Taishang General Associations are still open as usual, and shouting and drinking continue until late at night.</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>It is rumored that the three closed casinos have been moved to the Delmonde General Association, and are being renovated in the General Association, so as to merge and establish a new casino, which will open on June 2. Yesterday, rumors spread that the real reason for the closure of the above three casinos was losses, so it was decided to merge, in order to save huge expenses. It is said that one of the three casinos has lost 3 million yuan due to the sluggish gambling business, and has not paid any salaries for two months.</p>
<p>Establish One Gambling Den</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Times reported that, according to reliable sources, the casinos in the western district that have been ordered to close have decided to establish a new casino in Taiwan, named "Kowloon General Association". The investors have agreed to the gambling den. The address of the new casino is at 452 Haig Road, and it will open on Monday. This address was originally the site of the Delmonde Nightclub, which is temporarily closed for internal renovation.</p>
<p>Regain Momentum</p>
<p>Also, the English Da Mei Evening News reported that it is said that many small gambling dens in Shanghai West, which have been closed this morning (1st), will not reopen. However, the three major casinos hope to merge and regain momentum, but in order to avoid attention, they may change to entering and exiting through the back door.</p>
<h3>Left Foot Injured By Explosion</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 PM yesterday, Li Yigui, a 27-year-old fisherman from Yangzhou, was fishing on the shore of the Jiang Zhao Family Residence opposite the Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. He discovered a hand-pulled grenade left on the shore. Because he did not know it was an explosive, he kicked it with his foot. The grenade exploded immediately, injuring Li's right foot. He was then transported to Bao Jiang Hospital for treatment by hired vehicle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Arrest Japanese Gamblers In Nanshi Casinos</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate Police Department dispatched officers to the Xiyuan, Huamin, Dasheng, Tongqing on Zhonghua Road, and Lvbao, Yongan, and other gambling dens on Luxiangyuan Road in Nanshi at around 11:00 AM the other day, and arrested more than a dozen Japanese men and women who were gambling there. They were escorted to the Japanese police station. It is reported that Kim Jae-nam, a Taiwanese, and his wife, Matsuo Kimiko, have repeatedly committed gambling crimes and have been arrested several times. They have now been arrested again and will be escorted back to their home country.</p>
<h3>American Refugee Hospital Makes Full Use of American Wheat to Produce Various Nutritious Foods for the Poor and Sick, Uses Wheat Bags to Sew Clothes and Bedding for Distribution, Established Four Years Ago, Benefiting More Than 15,000 People</h3>
<p>The American Refugee Hospital on Whitelee Avenue (located in the First People's Hospital) opened on December 1, 1937, to assist in caring for more than 200,000 refugees in various refugee camps in Shanghai at that time, benefiting the poor and sick. It has been nearly four years since then, and it still provides meals for 500 people every day. According to Dr. MacCraiggen, the hospital director, of these 500 people, 268 are patients, and the rest are hospital staff.</p>
<p>American Red Cross Provides Rice And Wheat</p>
<p>Most of the food distributed by the hospital is provided by the Shanghai Committee of the American Red Cross. The activities of the American Red Cross in transporting broken wheat and rice to Shanghai for disaster relief have been repeatedly recorded. The Shanghai Committee of the Association announced last week that broken wheat will be transported in thicker bags in the future, as the poor can use these bags to sew clothes. The clothes of the children in the hospital and the hired workers are made of wheat bags, and the sheets and other items needed in the hospital are also made of wheat bags.</p>
<p>Remarkable Results in Infant Care</p>
<p>Chinese medical professionals know that wheat is a very nutritious food and is preferred by those who are accustomed to eating rice. The food provided by the American Refugee Hospital is a mixture of rice and wheat, and its nutritional value is superior to that of rice alone. Every Saturday morning, the hospital holds infant care sessions, and women bring their babies to the hospital. The hospital weighs, bathes, and treats the babies one by one. Before leaving, they are given soy milk powder and wheat to improve the health and weight of the babies. The soy milk powder is made by hospital workers grinding soybeans and water, adding other nutrients, and then drying them into powder.</p>
<p>15,000 People Completely Free of Charge</p>
<p>In April, the hospital treated a total of 731 patients. In total, the hospital has treated a total of 16,573 patients since its opening, of which 15,635 were completely free of charge. Patients were hospitalized for a total of 324,870 days, of which 311,611 days were free of charge. A total of 2,969 operations were performed. In addition to general medical work, the hospital also has specialists in charge of ENT, ophthalmology, dermatology, obstetrics, and gynecology. The hospital has two floors for wards and patient facilities, and the upper two floors are for laboratories and dormitories. The hospital is well-equipped, and although its work is inevitably restricted by equipment and finances, it has done a great deal to benefit the citizens.</p>
<h3>Thugs Rob Military Vehicle</h3>
<p>At 9:15 last night, someone called the Jiaozhou Road branch of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company in Shanghai West to hire a car, and asked it to drive to the Yuan Yuan Lou restaurant in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu. After receiving the call, the company immediately sent driver Shi Asan, 28 years old, in car number 18444. After arriving there, two men got into the car and asked the driver to drive to Lane 174, Whitelee Avenue. When the car drove to the entrance of the lane, they ordered the driver to stop. One man immediately took out a pistol and forced Shi Asan out of the car, and drove him to the wasteland behind Lane 174. The man with the gun watched him and forbade him to make any noise. The car was driven away by another man, and its whereabouts are unknown. More than twenty minutes later, the man with the gun also left. Shi Asan was then able to regain his freedom and reported to the police station. At 10:10, the car was still found near Lane 174. The reason for the two men robbing the car is temporarily unknown.</p>

According to reports from the Dahua News Agency, the school authorities expressed their willingness to mediate yesterday evening. Educational officials then convened representatives of the faculty and staff and school officials late at night for sincere discussions. Both sides were deeply moved. As a result of the mediation, the school authorities accepted two conditions for raising pay: (1) Salaries will be calculated based on six months per semester, starting this semester; (2) $300 will be allocated as a living allowance for teachers. Other matters will be handled separately due to time constraints, with officials agreeing to address them later. As both sides understood the greater good, the situation took a rapid turn for the better, and the faculty and staff are scheduled to resume teaching this morning.</p>
<p>Another report: The faculty and staff of the private Aiguo Second Elementary School on Avenue Road and Route Mettelhers previously submitted a joint request to the school for allowances. The school authorities agreed to provide a temporary allowance of $10. Due to rising living costs, they have now made additional demands: (1) An allowance of $40 per person, starting in May; (2) Teachers may not be dismissed without cause; (3) Contracts for the next semester should be issued two weeks before the final exams; (4) Starting next semester, full-time teachers will be paid for six months per semester. It is reported that the school principal has agreed to an allowance of $25, contingent on signing a mediation agreement, but has not responded to the other requests. Therefore, the faculty and staff have submitted a request for mediation to educational officials.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Chinese Stock Market</h3>
<p>— Wang Yutong</p>
<p>The development of modern industry relies heavily on the adjustment of finance. Finance is to industry what blood is to the human body. Without the circulation of blood, the body will decay. Conversely, if finance is not supported by industry, it is like blood leaving the body, unable to exert and display its valuable functions. Therefore, blood and body are inseparable. In today's economically developed countries, the capital market and the financial market must advance side by side and develop together. The financial market focuses on the acceptance and discounting of bills, which is short-term finance. The capital market focuses on the underwriting and trading of securities, which is long-term finance. If the two can circulate flexibly and adjust appropriately, so that domestic idle funds have legitimate avenues for investment, and industrial and commercial enterprises can benefit from flexible and convenient funding, the contribution to the growth of the national economy will be significant. In the past, there was no trading market for Chinese company securities, making it difficult for company stocks to circulate. Investors also worried about the stagnation of funds, leading to hesitation and difficulty in raising capital. As a result, production enterprises were confined to one area, and social idle funds flowed into speculation, which harmed finance. This is why commentators today say that promoting the capital market cannot be delayed. In the past, the selling targets of China's securities market were mostly government bonds, while the stock or bond securities market of corporate enterprises had few transactions. Therefore, in the future, we must wait for the completion of our entire financial structure, such as (1) the formation of the financial system and the establishment of a bank specialization system, (2) the enrichment of the financial market, (3) the unification of paper currency issuance and the exertion of central bank functions, (4) the concentration of national capital and the bank merger movement, (5) the prosperity of industrial and commercial enterprises and the implementation of low-interest policies. After the completion of these organizations, special banks should lead the financial community in establishing a real estate securities market, so that the already issued stocks and corporate bonds of corporate enterprises can be traded and circulated in the market, and also to assist in the creation and development of new enterprises, underwriting or selling corporate stocks or corporate bonds, so that the newly issued securities are easy to sell, and the new enterprises can easily obtain the necessary funds. This is of great importance to the future of our country's industry.</p>
<p>Recently, speculative markets such as Shanghai foreign stocks, yarn, flowers, and gold have been plagued by repeated turmoil. The Chinese people are unaware and misled by rumors, causing countless people to become trapped and lose money. People with insight have risen to advocate and promote the Chinese stock business, hoping to gradually guide the idle funds gathered in Shanghai into the right track, and also to help the prosperity of the business community. Therefore, the Chinese stock operators have jointly organized a public trading market, publishing daily market prices. The trading methods are slightly similar to foreign stock trading. Among them, the most common trading companies are: Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Jin City Bank, Zhongyi Trust Company, Tongyi Trust Company, China Electric, Zhabei Water and Electricity, Xin Xin Company, Da Xin Company, Wing On Company, Sincere Company, Wing On Yarn Factory, Da Sheng Yarn Factory, Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Family Industry Society, Sino-French Oil Factory, Nanyang Tobacco, Da Zhonghua Match, Huacheng Tobacco, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, Kang Yuan Canning Factory, Guanshengyuan, Merlin Food Company, etc. The above companies are listed in a simplified table below:</p>
<p>(Note) The above table is based on China Stock Company Reports and recent surveys, × is Hong Kong dollars, Pu is ordinary stock, and Xian is preferred stock</p>
<p>The stocks of the above companies are only excerpts of the most frequently seen companies that trade on the current market. For example, (1) the commercial bank stocks of Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Jin City, Zhongyi Trust, etc. are all due to their own business expansion, solid foundation, and other factors. Moreover, Tongyi Trust has been restructured and resumed operations since February of the 27th year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 1.36 million yuan. At the same time, interest-free bonds of 1,187,945 yuan were issued. In terms of dividends, a 3% weekly interest rate was guaranteed from the 27th year, limited to two years. Although the rate was abolished to 1% in the 29th year, the principal of interest-free bonds began to be repaid by 1% at the same time, which is enough to show that its business has gradually entered the right track. (2) Yong'an, Sincere, Da Xin, and other department stores have made considerable progress. As for Xinxin Company, its total capital is 3.52 million yuan in national currency. Among them, the 320,000 yuan of preferred shares should enjoy a profit of only five years, which has expired. The company's 15th annual general meeting of shareholders resolved that all dividends should be changed to a weekly interest rate of 8%. Therefore, the dividend for the 29th year has been paid at 8%. In terms of its business, since the expansion of the new shopping mall last year, the results have been improving day by day. Other affiliated businesses, such as the establishment of the Xindu Hotel, the Green Reality Theater, and the Xin Xin Barber Shop, have also been progressing smoothly. (3) The market price of new pharmaceutical companies such as Wuzhou Pharmacy's stock has exceeded the face value by more than one time. Xin Asia, Xinyi, and Zhongqu factories not only have generous dividends, but also increase capital and expand every year. For example, Xin Asia's official interest and bonus interest reached more than 30% last year. Zhongfa Pharmacy implemented an increase in capital in the 28th year due to the establishment of the Sino-French Serum Factory, the Sino-French Oil Factory, and the expansion of its own business. The dividend and increased capital donation for the 28th year totaled more than 50%. (4) Tobacco companies such as Nanyang Brothers and Huacheng are all leaders in the industry. Nanyang Brothers added two branches in Hong Kong and Chongqing after the war, and the business was very prosperous. It is reported that the company's inventory of raw materials is sufficient for at least two years, and there is no need to seek external sources. In addition, the company also has a large foreign exchange fund, and the future of the business is unlimited. A dividend of one yuan was pre-paid in the 28th year, and two yuan was pre-paid in the 29th year. (5) The dividends and bonuses issued by other food companies such as Guanshengyuan, Merlin, and Taikang are also quite generous, and they are all increasing capital and expanding.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief introduction to the contents of each company, in order to glimpse the recent developments of the Chinese stock market. It is hoped that people with intentions will jointly promote it, so that finance and production business can be integrated into one, so that one day it will not only add a different color to China's financial industry, but also be celebrated for the future of the industry.</p>
<h3>On Today's Labor Issues (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Hu Xishan</p>
<p>Wage Issues</p>
<p>Humans must have living expenses in order to survive; laborers rely on their wage income to maintain their lives. In other words, laborers use wages to obtain the necessities of life in order to continue their labor force. However, in fact, the average wage that Chinese laborers can obtain is only enough to support their minimum living expenses, and within a certain period of time, the wage amount is mostly fixed and does not increase. However, the cost of maintaining life is constantly changing with the market price. Since the war, prices in various places have been rising. For example, the indices of the five most closely related necessities of life for workers in Shanghai are all rising, such as the food item. The index in the 25th year was 117.450, and it increased to 815.0 in April of the 30th year; for the fuel item, the index in the 25th year of the Republic of China was 190.33, and it increased to 759.54 in April of the 30th year. Under the circumstances of rising prices and the decline in the purchasing power of currency, workers must feel endless pain, making life difficult to stabilize and affecting work efficiency. The only way to save it is to increase wages. However, should wages be increased according to the rise and fall of the cost of living index, or according to the actual situation? In fact, the cost of living index continues to rise, and even if it is increased according to the rate, it is still not enough to catch up with the reality; the result may not be effective. Now, the method of living allowances is mostly adopted, and the standard of allowances is set according to local prices and the living conditions of the workers. However, this basic standard should still be based on the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Working Hours Issue</p>
<p>In today's resistance construction, should the working hours of laborers be extended in order to adapt to the huge need for materials and to seek an increase in production? It is also an issue that should be researched and opened. In peacetime, the general view is that the working hours of workers should be standardized at eight hours per day; this kind of proposition belongs to a social purpose that emphasizes human rights. The existence of this proposition does have its actual theoretical basis, but during wartime, extending the working hours in order to increase the amount of production cannot be said to be a neglect of human rights of society; the argument between the issue of wartime working hours and social purpose is completely consistent in principle. The reason for requesting a reduction in working hours in peacetime is nothing more than to prevent the exploitation of laborers by capitalists. In today's wartime, this phenomenon does not exist due to the power of the government. To put it bluntly, the wartime labor hour issue is no longer a social purpose-based issue, but a condition that should be suitable for economic purposes. According to the purpose of economy, in order to increase the amount of production, it is necessary to increase labor hours; however, we cannot absolutely extend the working hours of laborers: the premise is still to seek that the labor of workers is not wasted during working hours, because the labor of each worker is limited, and excessive labor will inevitably lead to fatigue and affect work efficiency; therefore, in the process of extending labor hours, the degree of fatigue should also be considered; the best is to use action analysis and time analysis, so that the labor spent in work can be correct and the efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p>Implementing an Excellent Worker Guidance System</p>
<p>The lack of skills or non-serious work of workers can be said to be the most significant problem of labor. In any industry, the excellence of the quality of production and the excellence of work efficiency are directly related to machinery and raw materials; and the quality of workers' work is no less important than machinery and raw materials. Modern industrial techniques not only rely on the good of machinery and raw materials, but also on the specialization of workers' skills. However, factories often lack good management personnel, resulting in a lack of excellent technical workers. In the current situation in our country, in order to save the time of training workers and reduce the cost of employing management personnel, and to achieve the excellence of products and the enhancement of efficiency, an excellent worker guidance system can be adopted. This system is to select ten or so workers with relatively pure technology in the whole field, and designate them as the basic excellent workers of the whole factory; during work, these excellent workers will also guide and correct other workers with inferior work skills at any time. After work, their duties are to train other workers. In order to facilitate the implementation of this system, they can be divided into groups and arranged according to grades; for example, each excellent worker is required to guide ten or fifteen people, and a most excellent worker can be set up above every ten or fifteen excellent workers to guide the basic excellent workers; from this, they can reach the factory technician or factory director according to grades. This kind of militarized organization can not only promote work efficiency, but also meet the requirements of wartime organization. (To be continued in issue 371)</p>
<h3>Centralized Clearing System</h3>
<p>— Qiao</p>
<p>The so-called "clearing system" is actually a monetary form of barter. The contracting parties conduct trade in accordance with the agreement; there is no need to pay in cash, but only to calculate on the books. This is an economic dictatorship that forcibly maintains the balance of international payments. Originating in Germany, it was initially limited to "clearing agreements" established bilaterally between countries, and has now evolved into a "multilateral clearing system." The "multilateral clearing system" began after the establishment of the German-Italian Agreement in September 1940. According to the agreement, all receipts and payments from Italy to German-occupied areas were handled by the German clearing fund; and clearing between the occupied areas could also be carried out through the fund. This "German Clearing Fund" thus became the representative of all external claims and debts of the German-occupied areas. Therefore, Belgium could use its claims against the Netherlands to offset its debts to Norway on the fund's books. Similarly, Italy could also use its claims against Party A to offset its debts to Party B. Thus, the three or four clearing balance accounts that often occurred under the past "clearing system" have now become only one balance, which is much simpler to handle than before.</p>
<p>This "centralized clearing system" also has one advantage, which is that it allows exporters to quickly recover export payments. Under the old "clearing system," it was often very difficult for exporters to quickly recover their export prices if the central bank's clearing account did not have sufficient funds. Because the counterparty, regardless of the general state and seasonal situation of its trade, when it had a substantial clearing surplus claim on the other party in the case of exports exceeding imports, would not allow the new payment from the other party to be paid immediately. Therefore, the other party's exporters would have to wait for a considerable period. However, under this new system of "centralized clearing," the trade difference between Countries A and B can be offset by the difference with Country C. The rigidity of the past is likely to be eliminated under this flexibility.</p>
<p>This kind of "centralized clearing system" is more flexible the more countries participate; because the more complex the economic structure and supply and demand types of the countries involved, the greater the possibility of mutual offsets; this is obvious.</p>
<p>However, to ensure the solvency of this "centralized clearing system," the prerequisite is a central currency that can serve as the standard for the currency value of other related countries. And this central currency is actually the mother of the monetary systems of all related countries. In other words, the country that owns this central currency actually owns the monetary suzerainty of other related countries. To put it more clearly, it is the leader of this currency group, and all the monetary systems and even the countries and nations participating in this group are just its vassals. Only in this way can Germany create this system, which is naturally limited to countries occupied or controlled by it, and only to the extent that its position of occupation and control remains unshaken. Therefore, it is not surprising that so many European countries participated in this "centralized clearing system" by the end of 1940, as shown in the following table.</p>

<h3>### High Prices for Decoration Materials, Tobacco Market Facing Prosperity</h3>
<p>Tobacco market situation: Purchase prices have been gradually tightening for days, mainly because the factory's decoration materials have been rising continuously, so wooden boxes have been cancelled and replaced with paper boxes. Old wooden boxes on the market are in high demand, and hoarding households are selling less and less, all showing a wait-and-see attitude, which makes the market atmosphere gradually improve. Yesterday's market opened at 686 yuan for Five Flowers brand, and various parties had strong appetites. Later, it rose to 690 yuan. The British brand was 1,301 yuan, the Pinhai brand was 872 yuan, the Old Knife brand was 942 yuan, the Little Fairy brand was 675 yuan, 50-cigarette Qianmen were 385 yuan per 10,000, and 50-cigarette British brands were 300 yuan per 10,000. The market is unanimously prosperous, and as a result, paper boxes are still neither glorious nor disgraceful.</p>
<h3>### Quanzhou Longan Has a Poor Harvest</h3>
<p>Ordinary large-sized longan, mostly produced in Quanzhou. Last year's production was average, but due to inconvenient transportation to sales areas this spring, sales were sluggish, resulting in a gradual decline in market prices. According to recent letters from the new longan seedling customers, the shortage has already become apparent due to the inability to transport fertilizer for application, with only 10% expected. If autumn sales become active, the market outlook is expected to improve.</p>
<h3>### Peanuts (1)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The New World not only provides us with the wonderful "food of the gods"—the cocoa tree—, allowing us to taste the food enjoyed by the gods; it also bestows upon us this sweet "longevity" fruit—the peanut—, hoping that we can maintain eternal life! The price of the tree of the gods is high. Nowadays, in China, only a small number of people in big cities can have the happiness of personally experiencing its grace. However, peanuts are humble and unassuming, and since the 17th century AD, they have already graced our China, and have become intimate friends with any villager in our remote countryside! Therefore, our relationship with it is particularly close.</p>
<p>The Latin name of peanuts is Arachis hypogaea. The Chinese names also include groundnut, peanut, etc., and the most elegant name is of course Longevity Fruit. Its homeland is also in South America in the New World, and what is most surprising is that its relationship with sweet potatoes and potatoes is also that of twin brothers! One originally lived in Brazil and was relatively large and stout, with the shell usually containing only two long, oval peanut kernels; the other's sphere of influence was in Peru, and was more slender and thin, with the shell containing two to four almost perfectly round peanut kernels. Before Columbus discovered the New World, the two had already parted ways, each seeking development; so to ask whether their native land is actually in Brazil or Peru? This is another mystery that no one has been able to reveal yet!</p>
<p>Nature has decided that those with extraordinary talents and abilities like the peanut brothers should not be confined to obscurity among the indigenous Indians, but should come out to help the world and benefit the people of the world. Therefore, after the opening of the New World, they, like other precious plants, rose to prominence in succession. The one living in Brazil was hired by the Portuguese and moved to West Africa across the stormy waves, from which their descendants multiplied and gradually expanded their influence to the Gulf of Guinea and East Africa. The one living in Peru, however, responded to the invitation of the Spaniards and bravely settled in the Philippine Islands and the Moluccas, and also developed outward from these two centers, eventually traversing various islands and countries in the Pacific Ocean. As for the spread of peanuts to Central America, Mexico, and North America, it was also a tacit agreement between the Portuguese and the Spanish, who invaded from the east and west.

<h3>Discussions on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi, from the Netherlands</p>
<p>The sample trade fairs held in the European business world in the West every spring often lead to the upward development of relevant industries. Considering the high cost and shortage of foreign goods, which can greatly affect people's livelihoods, there is universal concern. Since ancient times, no outstanding heroes have not been inspired by changes in circumstances to achieve amazing feats, which is the ancient saying that "times create heroes." For example, those who make new contributions to poverty alleviation and medical treatment, and those who benefit the people and enrich the country through chemistry, have merits equal to good ministers and virtues comparable to good doctors. Application should not be limited to one path, and success should not be confined to one pattern. We should not only focus on producing Western medicines and supplements, but miss the great opportunity that is hard to come by in a hundred years. I will now describe six precious items from the "Utrecht Trade Fair" on its 25th anniversary to assist those who select the best from abroad with the ability to infer three things from one.</p>
<p>(1) Silk Without Silkworms: Nordic wood is transformed into semi-finished fiberboard, imported into the Netherlands, and transformed into "viscose" through several chemical actions. After filtering, it is passed through small holes to become silk, including machine-spun silk and two types of rayon, glossy and matte.</p>
<p>(2) Wool Without Sheep: The method is to extract casein from milk to fill the raw material of artificial wool.</p>

<h3>Summer Clothing, Food, and Health</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Time flies like flowing water, and in the blink of an eye, summer has begun. Summer is what people hate and fear. The heat and humidity make people sweat profusely, and its atmosphere is extremely unpleasant. If we do not pay attention to hygiene and protection during this period, it is easy to brew diseases! Therefore, the authorities of the two concessions have recently been actively promoting epidemic prevention movements, providing free vaccinations for citizens, and notifying restaurants to switch from cold dishes to hot dishes from June 1. These are all the best policies to prevent problems before they occur. I will now briefly record one or two points on clothing and food hygiene in summer for readers.</p>
<p>In summer, it is appropriate to wear light clothing to keep cool, which is right; but some people, especially laborers, when they feel hot, are unwilling to wear even a undershirt, leaving themselves bare-chested—that is, half-naked. This is not only unaesthetic, but also very unhygienic, because being bare-chested makes it easiest for poisonous mosquitoes to suck blood, causing lumps to appear on the skin, or if touching sharp objects, the skin breaks and easily becomes ulcerated! Therefore, no matter how high the temperature is, a protective undershirt must be worn! In addition, one must bathe diligently in the morning and evening, and wash and change clothes often. This maintains the cleanliness of the body on the one hand, and prevents clothes from becoming moldy from prolonged sweat stains on the other hand, making them durable. Also, when sleeping at night, one must not be greedy for coolness, and a thin quilt or blanket cannot be omitted.</p>
<p>"Disease enters through the mouth" is a maxim, so people should pay attention to their diet, especially in the summer season, when they should be particularly careful! For example, raw and cold foods and unripe fruits should generally be eaten sparingly. Other dishes should also be mostly vegetables and less meat. Also, leftover food and dishes from the previous day in summer are very easy to spoil. It is better to sacrifice them and not eat them. But in order to cherish food and be unwilling to discard it, you can re-boil the excess food in the pot at night, cover it well, and place it in a cool place, which can prevent spoilage.</p>
<p>The above is old news, but being able to do so can avoid many diseases.</p>
<h3>Soy Sauce Mold Problem</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>The plum rain season is coming, and soy sauce in everyone's kitchen is prone to mold, which is a big problem. Because moldy soy sauce is not only very unhygienic, but also spoils the taste of the soy sauce, so housewives often want to know how to prevent soy sauce from molding.</p>
<p>I met Mr. Xu Zhuodai the other day, and I asked him about this problem. He said, "Our Good Wife brand soy sauce will absolutely not mold, because it is disinfected before being bottled." He also said that soy sauce that is not disinfected is not guaranteed not to mold in hot weather. If raw water is mixed into the soy sauce, or if water stains on the utensils are carried into the soy sauce, it can cause the soy sauce to mold quickly.</p>
<p>Ordinary soy sauce merchants who do not disinfect, in order to prevent mold, generally use the following methods: (1) Using salicylic acid as a preservative, which has been discussed by someone in this column, is prone to stomach diseases and is not appropriate. (2) Using other harmless preservatives, although there are many types, the prices are very high, and it may not be cost-effective. (3) When bottling, add some salt to the hair, but it is often not easy to dissolve, and salt particles can still be found at the bottom of the hair after the soy sauce is used up, so the effect will certainly not be great. If it is completely dissolved, the salty taste is too strong, and it is easy to reduce the umami, which is not a good method either.</p>
<p>In short, it is best to disinfect, but recently fuel has been expensive, and many soy sauce merchants who are very calculating often refuse to do this conscientious work.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Country Life</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Outside Fengmen, Suzhou City, nine miles by water, the town is named Zhouzhuang, the former residence of the virtuous Mr. Lu Guimeng. When Lu died, people gave him the posthumous title Mr. Fulishan. The land is passed down by people, and it has been named after him to this day. It is close to Kunshan. Zhouzhuang is a joint border between Suzhou and Kunshan, separated by a river. The Wusong River runs through it, and it is actually an important passage for the Beijing-Shanghai waterway.</p>
<p>Before the Tang Dynasty sculptures in Baosheng Temple underwent changes, the current sages advocated that specialists be in charge of preservation, which was widely publicized and praised as the essence of our country's art. I came late and was unable to see the true face of Mount Lu, which I regret, because troops are stationed here. Although the old objects are safe and sound today, only insiders can explore them.</p>
<p>The entire town is surrounded by water. There are bridges to the east, west, and south, but the north is lacking. There are eight classes that cannot be reached without a boat. Is it because it did not suffer from war before the westward march of the war?</p>
<p>The town has more than 3,000 residents. Before the war, there were street lights and telephones. Each station was equipped with electric fences and reinforced concrete watchtowers, providing a high-altitude view and a clear overview. Transportation included "Suzhou-Zhouzhuang" and "Kunshan-Zhouzhuang" direct bus lines, which were still relatively convenient for traffic between cities and towns.</p>
<p>The soil here is fertile and production is abundant. In addition to grains, aquatic products are the first-class specialty. The rent collection has been badly damaged for many years, and the farmers are all looking at each other. However, the people are fond of gambling, and countless people have lost their families. And the ground is full of robbers, and even the cautious cannot sleep peacefully. The townspeople are well-fed all day long and have nothing to do, all taking sparrow battles as entertainment. The stakes are quite large, often hundreds of dollars, so the gambling style is very strong. The martial arts bureau has several tables, and hundreds of people rely on it for a living. The leaders are wealthy, with wives and concubines filling the rooms, and servants filling the courtyards, with extravagance comparable to that of dukes.</p>
<h3>Experiences in Thrift</h3>
<p>— Meizi</p>
<p>Recently, the most severe price increase has been in coal briquettes, which have jumped from ten yuan to about double that, which is a cause for concern for everyone, because a family can hardly do without using coal every day, so we should try our best to save coal. I have now changed to cooking lunch only once a day, cooking extra rice, and eating the leftover rice from lunch for dinner with hot water. This can reduce the coal used for cooking a meal. Side dishes are also cooked only once a day. Buy some pancakes for breakfast, which does not require any coal at all. Changed to washing my face with cold water in the morning to avoid having to light a fire in the morning. In the first few days of implementation, it was indeed a bit uncomfortable, but now I'm used to it. I heard that washing my face with cold water is very beneficial for the skin, so I decided to implement it. In this way, the coal briquette stove, which used to be lit from morning to night, is now lit only once at noon, saving about six-tenths of the amount of coal used, which is indeed a small help in reducing the burden. I think this method can be imitated by general economic families.</p>
<h3>Recommending a Family Publication That Meets Needs</h3>
<p>— Sire</p>
<p>Recently, after reading the third volume of the first issue of the Healthy Family Monthly, I am very pleased with the richness of its content and the sharpness of its arguments. On the vertical level, it has analyzed the complex and interconnected love between three generations of grandparents, parents, and children. On the horizontal level, it has explained how to maintain the emotions between husband and wife and maintain the happiness of the family forever. In the spiritual aspect, it has pointed out the benefits and harms; in the material aspect, it has also told the key to success or failure. Pan Yang'an's "Eternal Regret for the Passionate Since Ancient Times" in this issue points out the characteristics of love based on biological and psychological theories, and declares that being passionate is not necessarily beneficial. The writing is light and the argument is sharp, which can serve as a head-on blow for young men and women.</p>
<p>"Taboos" in our society have existed for a long time. Those with a little common sense know that their measures are meaningless, but bad habits are hard to change, often causing those who are interested to sigh three times! This article is written by Mr. Hu Shanyuan, using extremely simple common sense to refute the absurdity of "taboos." If there are those who have them, change them; if there are none, encourage them. It is very beneficial for saving time, energy, and money!</p>
<p>Parents' love for their children is originally a natural instinct, and no one can say it is inappropriate, but if love is excessive and violates the facts, then love is enough to harm them. Past facts and current examples are clearly verifiable and frequently seen. In this issue, there is a story called "Little Jin's Story," which is aimed at spoiling. It is hoped that interested parents can add flavor!</p>
<p>In addition to the above articles, others such as "My Family's Economic Management Method" comprehensively consider both increasing income and reducing expenditure in extraordinary times, "Lullaby for a Wet Nurse" depicts the strange tales in turbulent times, and "Twilight Cries" narrates the remaining poison of feudal families are all very relevant to the times and meet needs.</p>

<h3>Recipes for the Week by Cai, the Star of the Family</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>There are many kinds of fish on the market. When housewives go to the market to buy, they either嫌其價昂嫌其多刺嫌其價昂嫌其價昂嫌其價昂嫌其價昂嫌其價昂</p>
<p>they either dislike the high price or the many bones, and cannot decide what kind of fish to buy for a while. Recently, the fish that are relatively cheap and have fewer bones are pomfret, which costs about ten cents per ounce. The most common way to cook them is braising. If you are tired of braising, you can try something new by braising them with tomato sauce and adding some chopped onions, which has a unique flavor. Or, you can steam them with mushrooms and ham slices and eat them with spicy soy sauce, which is also very delicious.</p>

<h3>After All, Only a High School Graduate</h3>
<p>— Qi Ming</p>
<p>After graduating, I obeyed my mother's order to visit my maternal uncle, asking him for a position in his bank. Previously, my mother had said to me, "Your father, when he was alive, did many favors for your uncle. This time, he will definitely grant your request." So, I changed into a newly washed blue cloth long gown and a pair of new cloth shoes.</p>
<p>When I arrived at my uncle's place, I told the doorman that the manager was my uncle, but he looked at my blue cloth gown, cloth shoes, and empty hands with a surprised expression, as if he didn't believe I was the manager's nephew. After I repeatedly explained, he finally allowed me to enter. Coincidentally, my uncle had guests, so I had to wait outside the office door again.</p>
<p>After waiting for a long time, the guests left. I walked into my uncle's office nervously and saw many gifts placed on the table. I thought they were probably left by the guest just now.</p>
<p>Strangely, my uncle, like the doorman, stared at my blue cloth gown, cloth shoes, and empty hands. A woman I didn't recognize asked, "Who is he?"</p>
<p>My uncle stammered, "He... I almost didn't recognize him. He is..." But he didn't say that I was his nephew, as if afraid I would make him lose face. The woman was also quite clever and didn't press the matter. Her cunning eyes moved to my body, making me very uneasy.</p>
<p>My uncle frowned and told me not to state my purpose, as he apparently knew it already. Then he said, "You're just a high school graduate?" "Yes, just a high school graduate."</p>
<p>Then my uncle shook his head and said, "Difficult. What can a high school graduate do? I never expected my uncle to say these words, and I was very ashamed and couldn't answer.</p>
<p>My uncle pointed to the woman next to him and continued, "This Miss is a graduate of University, and she's only working as a secretary here!" Obviously, my uncle was using her to humiliate me, so she laughed snidely with a tone of contempt.</p>
<p>I had to blush and swallow my anger, and then I excused myself.</p>
<p>As I was leaving, my uncle reluctantly added, "Difficult! If there's a position, I'll notify you within three days." It was as if he was warning me not to step into his noble office again.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the office door, I heard my uncle say, "Ha! Ha! This kid actually thinks..." followed by the female secretary's snickering laughter.</p>
<p>I never dreamed there would be such a result. My uncle didn't even mention my father's name. After returning home, I didn't have the courage to tell my mother what happened today. I only said that my uncle told me to wait three more days.</p>
<p>My mother was desperately hoping that I would find a position within three days. She said, "Your academic performance is good. This time, you will definitely be valued by your uncle..." Then she broke into a smile.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days passed, with no news at all. This was what I had expected. My mother was anxiously waiting. On the evening of the third day, she went to look for my uncle herself. I advised her not to go, but she refused to listen to me.</p>
<p>It was late at night when my mother returned. From her red eyes, I knew that she must have been insulted by my uncle just like me. She told me again in tears that my uncle said I was a bit foolish, an idiot. At this moment, I felt a pang of heartache, but I never understood my uncle's criticism of me as "foolish" and "idiot". Was it because he was afraid I would expose his relationship with the secretary that he gave me this terrible label?</p>
<h3>Received Relief Funds</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>—Sharing a Boat Together, Relieving School Employees—</p>
<p>The long-rumored 800,000 yuan relief fund has now come to light. Teachers in various schools who applied to the authorities have probably received some. The situation dates back to the winter vacation at the end of last year, when the central government, out of concern for the difficult living conditions of teachers in Shanghai, began an investigation and soon approved a sum of 800,000 yuan to provide relief to all teachers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>From then on, all the teachers in Shanghai stretched their necks, expecting the 800,000 yuan relief fund to be distributed as soon as possible. Indeed, in today's high prices, teachers have become virtually unable to live. After receiving this news, they naturally eagerly looked forward to receiving the relief fund as soon as possible!</p>
<p>However, after that, there was no news at all, for more than four months, there was no information. Of course, the teachers slowly began to feel disappointed, and in these four months, at first, things were still fine, but later everyone became suspicious. Coupled with constant rumors, was the money used up in the middle? Only a portion of schools were rescued, and most schools didn't get a share? Everyone had different opinions and there was no consensus. There were even leaflets advocating for action, and the atmosphere in the education community suddenly became tense.</p>
<p>Finally, the truth came to light. From mid-May, the 800,000 yuan, some say the total was 1.4 million yuan, began to be distributed. But because public schools were issued first, when people received the relief funds, private school teachers did not receive them, and they felt even more panicked. Until recently, private schools were also issued, and their hearts calmed down, knowing that the relevant parties did indeed need time to manage the procedures before the money could be distributed today.</p>
<p>Our group of private school teachers and staff finally received the official notice. The principal went to collect the money that day, and the news of the distribution was what everyone cared about almost every day. Day after day, it was finally the day of distribution. Everyone went to the principal's office and took the money out, showing an inexplicable state of joy on their faces. Because even older colleagues who had taught for many years had never received such extra income.</p>
<p>All full-time teachers received a significant amount of money, so everyone was very happy and grateful for the central government's great virtue. Then, they planned how to use the relief funds. Buying rice, paying off debts, redeeming pawned items, and buying new clothes, everyone had their own uses. At the same time, they hoped that the central government could distribute relief funds every semester in the future.</p>
<p>Then, because the teachers had received relief funds, the school workers also began to call for it. Indeed, in the same organization, working on the same line, teachers had received relief funds, but school workers had not. In fact, the lives of school workers are just as painful as teachers, and their request for relief is of course reasonable.</p>
<p>However, this problem is somewhat difficult. First of all, the authorities designated this relief fund to relieve teachers and staff, and school workers were not included. If we appeal to the authorities, the central government will never make a big deal out of a small issue and allocate another sum specifically to relieve school workers. Then what about the teachers who got the money, and what about the school workers? Leaving them aside and letting them watch the teachers get the money? Of course, it would be unbearable!</p>
<p>People who get along together every day and do the same work on the same line are of course sympathetic to each other. The only way is to have a attitude of sharing a boat together, and teachers take some money from the relief fund to relieve school workers. A group of colleagues at our school decided to automatically provide relief to school workers. Whoever got more money would take out more, and whoever got less would take out less.</p>
<p>As a result, some gave ten yuan, some gave five yuan, and some gave three yuan or two yuan. Everyone was very willing to take out the money and collected more than one hundred yuan. It was distributed to seven or eight school workers, and each person also got more than ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Tangible Friendship</p>
<p>"Don't mention that, quickly continue!" In fact, this was also Yu Kun's own shortcoming, so he sympathized with Zhao Si.</p>
<p>"As a result, I was made drunk by them, so drunk that I was like a dead pig. I don't know when I woke up on the third day. After waking up, I still didn't know that they had done such a good show. It wasn't until Seventh Master came to tell me that the Third Boss was sick in Tianjin and was going to pack up things at home that I realized that the cash was also lost, the passbook and the acting equipment were gone, and even Rong Jin, the big guy, and two other little bastards had left together! This made me almost die of anxiety—"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the sweat on Zhao Si's face and head could no longer allow him to rest for a while.</p>
<p>"Rong Kui, Jin the Big Guy, and their gang, don't they have someone behind them?" Yu Kun interrupted as he wiped away his sweat for the second time.</p>
<p>"Yes, they do, but they can't do anything!" Zhao shook his forty or fifty pound head. "Later, Seventh Master came up with the idea. On the one hand, he opened a loss report and taught me to report to the police station. On the other hand, he called the bank to send a letter, asking them not to pay when they saw the deposit slip and to detain the person immediately..." "Then were they detained?" Yu Kun thought this was a very good hope!</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, it was too late. One usable passbook had been emptied by them, and there were two called fixed-term deposits, which were not touched. But the people had already left. They knew they couldn't touch it, so of course they wouldn't go again!"</p>
<p>"In this way, is it all over?" A line from a play unconsciously rushed out of Yu Kun's mouth.</p>
<p>"Don't be impatient, there's more to come! Zhao Si passed a large sunflower fan from his right hand to his left." Seventh Master asked about the situation and knew that the kid Ji Zhaoxiong had been there on the first day. He immediately questioned him when he returned. I don't know how the two sides made a mistake. Seventh Master actually made that kid..." (121)</p>
