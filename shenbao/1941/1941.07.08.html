<h3>廓淸投機市塲</h3>
<p>自工部局擔任運銷洋米以還，滬市米價，旋告穩定，一般嗷嗷待哺者，喘息得以稍舒，工部局之決心毅力與夫敏捷手段，殊足稱頌。</p>
<p>顧人民對於最近數月來米價在漲所受之敎訓，非但未因凍餒而盡為大腹賈轥轢下之餓莩，抑且促成公民精神與節約之鍜鍊，殆亦因禍得福之謂歟！惟米為生活必需條件之一，其他衣食住行問題之亟待解決者尙多。</p>
<p>若近月來煤價之飛漲，其影響市民生計之慘酷程度與米何異；而揆其飛漲之理由，舍投機壟斷而外，殊無可以成立者，蓋自津浦以至本市鐵路綫一帶各地之煤料以及海防等地之燃煤，均可源源運滬應市也。設商人執迷不悟，藉端扳抬、則租界當軸唯有毅然決然將煤料收歸專賣，而杜絕日用品之投機，蓋今日之癥結，全伏於分配之操縱，而非供不敷求之問題也。</p>
<p>再水電供給與公共車資，近已一再增價。市民頗有不勝負擔之苦。查各該公司收入，已年有羨餘，今猶認為不能滿意，而必須滿足其預定之利潤，此誠與非常時期商業經營之宗旨與道德。大相背馳。抑亦為任何國家所勿許者也。</p>
<p>又自中日事變以還，本市地主，咸能深明大義，未將房租在抬，而法院調解房租糾紛，亦以人民生計這前提，因此，市民受惠非淺。乃近來頗有主張重估地價，以為充裕稅收之張本，果爾，則房租之提高，勢在必行，其將嫁禍於市民之負擔，不言而喻。</p>
<p>綜上各點，與民生均有切膚之關係，必須逐一予以糾正，庶導生活於正軌。顧根究滬市民生之所以造成如此嚴重局面者，實須歸罪於本市交易所之投機交易，試陳現狀，用證吾說。夫標金，外匯，紗花，股票，以及公債等等，雖間有套利與投資性之交易，似不能視為賭博式之投機，但研察實際，則什九皆屬賭博，蓋交易者絕無收現與交貨之絲毫願望，而為絕對之買空賣空，以謀賺其進出價格之差額。査是類交易中之規模最大者，則當推標金（市塲上通稱烚赤或條子）之買賣。據最近專家之估計，標金買賣之資金約在二十萬萬元與二十五萬萬元之間，而最高之估計，則為六十萬萬元。按滬市所有之標金現貨，計有五千條之譜（每條十兩重），而每日標金交易，無論多頭（買空）或空頭（即賣空），恒超過五萬條以上。倘每條以市價六千五百元計，而以每日一萬條之買賣論，則每日之交易為六千五百萬元；以此而視上海股票交易每週之三千萬元（此係六月第一週之數字），直有天壤之別矣。即外匯市塲之交易，亦不能與標金同日而語；近日因一千萬元之美匯空頭而補進之標金多頭，僅係每月中標金買賣之極小一部份而已。</p>
<p>上述標金市塲之交易，為各種投機交易之冠，毫無疑義。在經濟學立塲言，投機交易，原未可厚非，而且有其功用；第以滬市交易，並非盡屬具有經濟功用之投機，而泰半皆為有害民生之賭博，前已略為剖析，此滬市投機市塲之所以必須加以廓淸也。復以標金交易之影響人心，甚至利令智昏；而其他商業亦步亦趨，是皆標金交易為之推波助瀾而使然。是以欲廓淸滬市投機而安定數百萬居民之生活，非自取締標金市塲之投機交易不為功。前工部局提出討論收支問題時，西人中不乏建議將標金交易與一切投機交易課以重稅者，寓禁於徵，一舉兩得，惜乎未見其實行也。</p>
<p>在過去二年中，滬市租界仍能藉投機式之交易而呈現畸形發展之繁榮者，蓋以遷避租界五百萬人民，咸能直接或間接協助投機市塲之支撑也。投機交易之維持，端賴婦孺散戶之願解囊為孤注一擲，宛如鳥雀之供鷹鸇誅逐是也。又如吞舟之魚，全賴水之相濟，今則池水已枯，吞舟之魚，勢無用武之地，將待其一蹶不振，市塲反動之慘酷，豈楮墨所可形容哉！</p>

<p>反抗侵略精神連繫歐亞兩地人民反抗侵略、自始即具有精神上之連繫、惟至今日、始為世界上決心肅淸暴力之民族所公認耳、故中日戰事進入第五年、殊値得世人注意、中日戰事、殆已證明予吾人以不可動搖之信念、即任何黷武國家、無論其軍隊如何優越、無論其業已佔領土地如何廣大、對方如不承認戰敗、則侵略者亦不足以言勝利，</p>
<p>英通中國足資模範世無長期能單獨作戰之軍隊、如欲得逞、必須獲得人民之擁護、今全能國家僅以鞭策人民為事、不足以言軍隊與人民合作、其不能長期作戰、固意中事也、中國奮戰四年、土地淪陷、不下數千方哩、生命財產、損失不知其數、惟迄今持「正義必能戰勝强權」之信念未稍衰、數年來中國能於作戰中建國、即基於此、世人凡欲具大無畏精神者、應以英勇之中國為模範、然後始能增加勇氣、與實現其希望焉、」</p>

<h3>昨日事變四週年　各界情緒振奮　市民自動停止娛樂宴會若干不必要馬路均封鎖</h3>
<p>昨日蘆溝橋事變四週年、滬市各界、一致沉默紀念、並自動停止娛樂宴會、茹素一天、為殉難軍民誌哀、各娛樂塲所及廣播電台、循例停止娛樂節目、以表哀思、全市市民為表示益加奮勉與警惕起見、矢誠擁護旣定國策、並聯電最高當局及將士致敬、情緒異常振奮、</p>
<p>若干馬路實施封鎖公共租界工部局警務處、除已施行各項必要戒備外、昨日淸晨五時、特將沿愛多亞路福煦路各不必要馬路予以封鎖、如三洋涇橋一帶鈎橋·廣西路·雲南路·龍門路·重慶路·慕爾鳴路等各馬路、均予封鎖、其他如外灘·河南路·鄭家木橋·東新橋·虞洽卿路·同孚路·西摩路·哈同路等，則均以鐵絲網攔成出入口、由大批探捕駐守防範搜檢、法租界雖未封鎖馬路、但亦加派警員、從事警備、</p>
<p>南市戒備異常苛密昨晨七時起與南山毘連租界之各鐵門計有五處、如斜橋·南陽橋·新橋街·新開河·十六舖等處、一律關閉、直至下午一時、始完全開放、恢復交通、斜橋邑廟中華路等處、均置有日兵站崗、蓬萊路並置有小型坦克車兩輛、自西門至小東門横街之肇嘉路、禁止通行、東西阻斷、環城行駛之公共汽車、亦宣吿停駛、至華租通話之電話、亦短時間內停頓、迨午後各鐵門開放後一律恢復如常、至六時許、各鐵門又一律關閉、</p>
<h3>最近滬對美貿易　特殊暢旺　德貨營業滯滯改向美廠定貨</h3>
<p>蘇德戰事發生後、德貨來源困難、德國顏料西藥五金機械等、一般囤貨者均在抬售價、致實需客家、均嫌價昂而改購美國貨者頗衆、邇來美國商各行營業均極旺、各進出口行因營業發達、紛紛致電向美國各製造廠定購各貨、一部份英商洋行、因英貨運滬航運困難、亦多改營對美國貿易、本市對美貿易之發達、為向所罕有、</p>
<h3>工部局洋米售價　每石提高六元　成本加增運費亦漲公倉餘款繼續訂購</h3>
<p>工部局頃發布吿、略稱、茲因本局洋米之產地成本劇增、運費亦漲、迫不獲已、爰將本局洋米之售價、予以提高、其最高零售價格、自本月八日起、改為每石（凈重八十公斤即一百六十市斤）國幣一百十六元、</p>
<p>首批倉米售與當局</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向食米公會管理委員會探悉、該會所訂購之倉米八萬包、首批二萬七千一百五十包業於本月五日裝「格蘭」輪抵埠、卸儲羅斯福堆棧、茲該項倉米業已售與工部局、每噸計二二四〇镑、售港幣二百八十五元一角三分、又手續費百分之一·五、每石（一百六十市斤）成本合國幣一百零二元、茲公倉委員會與工部局已定於今日付款交貨、工部局並將分發各米號平價銜接發售、</p>
<p>今後運費正在商議</p>
<p>公倉管理委員會前會與挪商華綸洋行洽妥、關於所有倉米、均由該洋行經理之「格蘭」「德達」兩輪承裝、當初言定每噸（計二二四〇磅）水脚九十五先令、現因船主要求、由九十五先令增至一百六十先令、茲公倉委員會鑒於與原有數字相差懸殊、故要求准予核减為每噸一百二十先令、藉輕成本、該會將於日內致函「格蘭」輪船主、要求遵行過去所訂合同、或酌量遞减、否則攸關成本甚鉅、現船主方面、並不堅持、</p>
<p>公倉米續購三萬包</p>
<p>昨日下午二時、八次委員會議、計到何德奎等暨法租界糧食委員會秘書維臬、討論、（一）第二期倉米應如何續行購辦案、議決、照本會現存之款、盡數購置、約可辦米二萬包至三萬包左右、惟因原設之購米委員會已有委員兩人離開上薄、另行推請葉扶霄·陳子彝·朱子香三人全權辦理、並不必專限定仰光一處、倘泰國米價及運輸方面比較相宜、不妨改向泰國購辦、二因須續辦倉米、請達孚洋行展長合同期限案、議決通過、並即日函請照辦、</p>
<p>棧司工潮設法調處</p>
<p>本市荳米雜糧業棧司、因向資方要求改良待遇及增加米貼未遂、於本月三日起發生怠工風潮、迄今五日、據大光社肥者探悉、自荳米業棧司發生怠工後、各碼頭倉庫堆棧之上棧、裝卸、出貨、駁運、塌車等小工二萬餘名、因上卸無貨、停止工作、惟該業工潮、若再延不解決、勢必影響上述各項工人生計、而生意外事件、故租界當局、現正積極設法調處、</p>
<p>棧司來函</p>
<p>據棧司方面來函略稱、昨載關於荳米雜糧業棧司罷工之消息、資方一度曾要求勞方自即日起先行復工、然後再開誠談判、惟勞方未允、現正在晝夜協議中云、上項消息、並不盡然、「查荳米雜糧業棧司皆知米為民食、決不願輕易怠工、故事先於六月十九日致函米行業同業公會雜糧業同業公會提出增加工資改善待遇之辦法五項、去函多日、置不答復、又於六月廿三日再函兩公會催吿、又不答復、斯時全體棧司、已有怠工之動機、經加勸導、始暫吿平息、</p>
<p>調解未成</p>
<p>旋於六月廿九日工部局政治部召集勞方問話、即派負責代表出席、隨帶五項要求、俾供參考、又於七月一日、工部局復來通知、定二日上午調解、資方竟亦不出席、當時改於同日下午重行調解、資方仍不出席、自七月三日起、全體棧司聯合帮工一致怠工以冀促成資方之覺悟、詎資方報捕拘捕棧司、訴以妨害自由、同時傳聞資方以棧司怠工、可刺激米價上漲、罷工愈久、米行利益愈大、旣有如此存心、自無要求先行復工之舉、恐外界誤會、予以聲明、」等語、査工部局對於此事正在計議調解辦法、勞方要求固屬過高、而生活壓迫、亦屬實情、雙方負責人諒均在熟籌辦法、以免有礙民食、</p>

<h3>美對外貿易年會　滬美商會參加　美國經濟已入備戰狀態自由貿易為國策所不許</h3>
<p>本市美國商會負責人、昨對記者宣稱、本年美國對外貿易協會、將於十月六·七·八·三日內、在紐約本薛文尼亞旅館舉行年會、本市美國商會、仍將按服向例、派代表前往出席、聞此項會議、議程中所列各案、頗為重要、凡與美國目前、對外有關之貿易各項問題、均將提出討論、據該會所發之通吿云、「由於佔我國出口貿易三分之一之歐洲市塲、已被切斷、故我國對英帝國之重要物產貿易、業已大為减低、故吾人今後欲維持此項貿易、實較第一次世界大戰時期、尤為困難、歐戰進至目前階段、已使我人在中立法案下所處之基本地位業有改變、今美國刻已全部動員、以援助英國及其協約國、因美國及西半球之防禦計劃、已使吾人之國民經濟轉變為備戰狀態、際此危急之秋、吾人之對於僅餘之若干處市塲之貿易、亦已因國防計劃關係、而遭受限制、格於此種各項客觀環境、故本屆年會會議程序中、不得不以相互交換意見為重要工作、再進而由對外貿易專家及投資家、討論戰時之各項貿易問題、擬具計劃、向政府提出建議、俾得放棄若干不必要之對外貿易統制此次戰爭之結果、對於吾人之關係、甚屬重要、如彼等將來對於吾人之貿易、勢必處於反對之地位、因此、吾人現時決不能在此種環境下、與其他民族作任何妥協、因彼等之宗敎·經濟·政治及社會等各項意識、均與吾自由民族相反也、」</p>
<h3>德義留居荷印僑民　突奉撤退命令　一行六百七十名已離境搭淺間丸來滬轉赴日本　盛傳日輪多艘停駛太平洋綫</h3>
<p>荷印與日本在巴達維亞之談判、現已滯於停頓狀熊下、首席代表芳澤、亦已悄然離去、昨巳過台北返國、德義婦孺一批、計六百七十名、突然撤離荷境、形勢有驟然轉緊之勢、此事現正引起英美各外交界之密切注視、日本自蘇德戰事發生後、迄未發表其對此次戰事中之態度、究置身事外、或履行義務、現猶靜觀中、</p>
<p>淺間丸定週三抵滬</p>
<p>德義留居荷印僑民、一行共六百七十名、包括德籍婦孺七十名、突於上週五奉各該國政府命令撤退、所有旅費、亦概由德義政府津貼、彼等業已乘日本郵船公司之淺間丸首途來滬中、（該輪載重一萬零十七噸、原行駛太平洋航綫）據悉該輪可於本週三抵此、在滬留泊後、即行駛往神戶、其中德義婦孺在滬有親友者外、其他將仍附原輪赴日、德義之所以撤退在荷印之僑民、殆為靜止之南太平洋、將激起風浪之預兆耶、</p>
<p>該輪航綫臨時更動</p>
<p>據日本郵船公司所發消息、淺間丸原定上週五由新加坡馬尼刺開來上海、但臨時突然改變計劃、由馬尼剌空輪逕駛荷印巴達維亞、裝載德義政府指定撤退之僑民六百七十名來滬、該輪此後或將停泊本國、決定取消馬尼剌航綫、暫不接受乘客與貨物、改由龍田丸維持該輪原有航綫、盛傳尙有三川丸等、均將停駛太平洋航綫、</p>
<p>澳與荷印聯防完成</p>
<p>澳洲與馬來亞荷印之實行聯防、甫於三日發表、英駐緬甸總指揮麥克萊奧中將、復於五日晚廣播、盛稱緬甸與遠東各部份航空根據地、設備完善、足以抗禦侵略、緬甸軍事配備、現代機械戰車等、亦已源源運到、此種帝國防禦總計劃中之任務、次第予以完成、麥中將之演說、對日盛傳將策動南進、頗具微妙、</p>
<p>荷印兵力充分準備</p>
<p>荷印在此次遠東局勢、實占重要一頁、頗有舉足輕重、苟向略侵者低首、則大好礦產、勢將被奪、對於民治國家之取給、不無影響、但荷印情報局長黎曼氏與總參謀長潑登氏、先後表示重仲抗禦決心、「荷印人士將為眞理而戰、任何犧牲、已在所不計、自由之信號將為悲壯之號角而激起矣、刻已動員海陸空軍人員、不計畫夜、正加緊訓練、完成艱鉅之捍衛工作、荷印防務、有充份準備、苟外來之暴風雨侵蝕不已、即焦土作戰、亦所不惜」、</p>

<p>有一天、正是火傘高張、悶熱不堪的當兒、一位先生匆匆來館、道出來意、說是預備捐款一千二百五十元給新普育堂、詢其姓氏、則笑而不答，但云為善不在圖報、請書無名氏可也、當時乃請其往附近華美藥房代收捐款處繳款、這種隱名為善的熱心者眞是難能可貴</p>
<p>孤兒所需要的</p>
<p>新普育堂前因經費無着、幾陷於停頓、現在總算已度過難關、但並未到一勞永逸的地步、所以捐款還是當務之急、除捐款外、物品也是非常需要的、如米·油·鹽·布疋·藥品等等、讀者將所多餘的送給缺乏的孤兒這定是你們樂意去做的事情、</p>
<p>兒童愛護兒童</p>
<p>許多捐款人中、兒童的捐款亦不少、如中法學校幾個學生、類思小學幾位小朋友等、他們將父母給他的糖菓錢節省下來、捐給貧苦的孤兒、這眞是一種純潔的童心的表現、捐款雖微、其熱誠却極可嘉、希望小朋友們一致起來、節省些無謂消耗，捐給孤兒們、作兒童愛護兒童的義舉、</p>
<p>代收捐款地點</p>

<p>紗市先高後平、趨勢散漫乏勁、此因有一部份灰心、不願做買賣、因之交易轉趨澹泊、成交减縮、於是上下之變遷範圍較狹、投機者更為掃興、不過有一部份在高價拖進者、極少數興緻依然濃厚、對於多額始終無放棄之念、據其觀測、須待一二星期以後、雙馬市塲當有與奮性、復見熱鬧、目前要冷一冷塲子的、總之現紗粤幫銷胃續强、查昨日買去粗細紗約有二千包左右、而今日運往香港者有一千二百五十件、又二十支雙馬高價為一千六百二十九元、低價為一千五百九十九元、午後初做一千六百零三元、漲至一千六百十三元、最後價為一千六百十二元云、</p>

<h3>蔗與糖蔗糖（二）　—外國之部—</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>這顯示他根本不明瞭蔗糖的製造法：因為雖說在甘蔗的莖和葉上有一種白粉生着，然而它絕對不是造糖的原料。公元後九十八年，羅馬自然科學家Pline　le　Jeune，也記載着在著名暴君尼祿朝時，醫生們用「印度鹽」這名字去指稱蔗糖：這種東西『形狀和顏色彷彿普通的食鹽，而有蜜的滋味。」要是這段記載眞出於Pline　le　Jeune之手而不是僞託的話，則在公元一世紀時已竟有「白汐糖」的製作和流行了！可惜這事找不到確切的旁證，而為多數的博學士所不欲置信，以為這話未免有點言之過早。</p>
<p>要說蔗糖之眞正流傳到地中海東部，而使歐洲人得到它的淸楚眞確的概念，那祗能追溯到公元六二七年東　馬皇帝Heracliug第一東征波斯的時候：那時戰利品中所掠獲的蔗糖，是被視為波斯國王寶藏中的一部分的。波斯人怎樣學會了製造蔗糖呢？大概在公元五百年以前，他們已竟在幼發拉庇河口Gondisapur城附近一帶栽種甘蔗；這地方有一個天主公敎的修院，修士們醫學極深，而和印度的醫生過往繁密；他們從印度醫生手裏學得造糖的秘訣而又把它精研改良起來，於是首先創製出那眞正純白堅固的蔗糖，而名之曰「Tabergad」：意義為「用刀斧砍裂者」。這纔是眞正「白沙糖」和「氷糖」的起源。而且我們現在所稱的「氷糖」，在波斯文中名叫Kand，同國王的名詞Kani或Khan，就是我國史書上所稱為「汗」的極為近似：我妄自揣測，以為最初祗有國王纔能享受它，所以它纔有了Kand這個名字。</p>
<p>栽培甘蔗這種風氣，在波斯國傳播極快，所以到了公元七世紀中葉强悍的阿刺伯人從沙漠中崛起而征服道塊地方的時候，速製糖工業也已竟盛極一時了。阿刺伯人馬上向蔗田和糖廠徵稅；這稅有時徵收的就是實物，就是那造好的沙糖，以備王宮素日或慶節的食用。阿刺伯人又把甘蔗廣播到凡是他們兵力所至的地方，首先波及的就是埃及：大概到了公元七五〇年左右，那肥沃膏腴的尼羅河三角洲上，已竟蒼蒼茫茫塵望而不是甘蔗田了。製糖技術也有長足的進步，因為從多少世紀以來，就有許多博學士在那裏埋首鑽研化學的緣故：譬如用石灰或植物灰以凈煉蔗汁的法子，就是從此時開端；又有人以為氷糖的製造也是肇始於埃及的。蔗糖的消費量，更是飛躍的增加。據一個名叫Lippemann的著作：『為王宮的婚筵或旁的慶祝一次所消費的沙糖，若用現今的數量表示，能高到六萬一千公斤或甚至七萬六千公斤』！甘蔗又隨着阿刺伯人所向披靡的兵勢，在公元七一〇年繁殖到摩洛哥，從這裏跨海卜居到西班牙，也因為這些地方風土相宜的緣故而立刻繁榮起來。有這時出現的幾種阿刺伯人所著的書，對於栽種甘蔗和造糖諸法描述的非常詳細而正確；而且在西班牙地中海沿岸的Valencia，Alicante和Malaga三個城中，還有當時用以壓榨甘蔗的石磨存留着呢。地中海東部一帶像巴勒斯坦，叙利亞，西西里島，和塞普魯斯島，也於八世紀中由阿刺伯人將甘蔗輸入。上述諸地，為中古時代著名之產糖中心，尤其埃及所造者，品質優越堅固，能歷時行遠，所以在商品中佔極重要的位置。（未完）</p>

<p>（一）工具的應用歷史根於地理、猶靈魂之附麗於軀殼、無軀殼則無靈魂、無地理又安有歷史、所謂工具、即指地理與地圖而言、而地理的範圍、至為廣大、地形·海洋·山脈·川澤·土壤·礦物·氣候·無一不包括在內、人類活動的大舞臺、當然在地球之上、即無一不受地理之影響與限制、如吾中國、居於溫帶、故為世界文明祖國之一、而文化的發達、原於河流、初民之活動、在黃河流域、逐漸而南、展至長江流域、再進而西河流域、黑龍江流域、東南限於大海、西北障於高山、北隔於沙漠、南昆於熱帶、於是此佔有世界五分之一、領土十四分之一的泱決大國、雖是得天獨厚、而四塞之發展、早有天然之限制、並且平原宜於農業、南方之民族、少剛勁之氣、高原宜於遊牧、北方之民族、多雄偉之風、因此談到文化、則南高於北、講到武功、則北勝於南、東晋之偏安、高宗之南渡、統一無常、分合不時、何一非受地域南北之限制、及至海運大興、科學進步、咫尺千里、縮地有法、於是此老大之古國、雖欲閉關自守、與人老死不相往來、勢不可得、其他氣候之　燠、土壤之優劣、出產之分布、何一不與歷史上的主人、發生密切關係、所以讀古代史者、對於顧祖禹於讀史方與記要、顧亭林的天下郡國利弊書、以及河渠志·水經注·地理今釋·地理韵偏·等、均需略讀一過、才不致對於歷史的背景、有囫圇吞棗、模糊影響之病、决於地理的、莫過於地圖如果地圖不明、則疆宇之分合、陵谷之變遷、政治區域之劃分、歷代關隘之險要、勢必頭昏目眩、棼若亂絲、胸中堆積許多史料、不能明其因果得失、又有何益、中國之製圖、最早的、首推晋代裴秀、作禹貢地域圖、唐之賈耽、作海內華夷圖、以一寸折百里、實開縮尺繪圖之始、古今郡國縣道四夷述、對古郡國題以墨、今州縣、題以朱、又為後世圖書分別朱墨所自始、其後淸初西人杜德華等奉命測繪各省各藩屬的地圖、定名皇與全覽圖、是為中國有實測地圖之始、乾隆時楊守敬所著歷代疆域沿革圖、將上下古今、斷代而畺理之、洵吾學界之盛業、近人蘇甲榮、復有中國地理沿革圖之創作、考證異同、辨析微芒、為晚近諸家所不及、足為治史學者、備梯航之助、這都是我們研究歷史不可少的讀物、</p>

<h3>娛樂狂</h3>
<p>— 簫雲</p>
<p>讀到上海人每月消耗於奢侈品與娛樂塲所的金錢的統計，那龐大的數字，總是令人為之咋舌。奢侈迷與娛樂狂可說是上海戰後的特殊現象。</p>
<p>然而我們查考第一次歐洲大戰時的歐美各國，情形也幾乎是沒有例外的。在歐戰之後，歐洲與美國各地的老少，因為情形上受到戰事的壓迫，在公餘之暇，大多變成娛樂狂。舞塲，賭塲，酒館，凡是尋歡作樂之所，莫不利市三倍。社會道德淪喪。大概所謂「人心不古，世風日下」者，正是這種時候。</p>
<p>據心理學家的意見，以為這種大規模的尋歡作樂的現象，並不是偶然的，人類在精神上受到壓迫以後，自然而然地會替自己我一個情緒上的出路。修養較深的人，會因為戰事的發生，而感到自己責任的重大，因此更牢固地站立在自己的崗位上，他們對於戰事的反應是富有建設性的。至於修養淺薄的人，他們的反應是幼稚的，是逃避性的，為了要暫時忘記精神上所受的壓迫起見，就走上過分躭溺於尋歡作樂的路上去了。</p>
<p>我們並不否認適度的高尚娛樂的利益與需要，然而我們願意特別在這裹指出的是：娛樂在人類是對戰事的一種淺薄的逃避性的反應，要消滅這種幼稚的現象，個人的修養是一個重要的關鍵。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>羅斯福的海上行宮</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>當此戰爭遍地，世局危殆的時期，羅斯福總統公餘之暇，惟一的消遣，就是乘游艇「波陀馬克」號出游，暫時忘却人世的紛爭，享受片刻的淸閑樂趣。</p>
<p>羅斯福休憇的地方，原有溫泉鎭和海地公園鎭兩處，但那裏有不斷的電話肆擾，不比在水面上淸閑自在。總統在童年時代，就喜歡弄船泛舟，及至做了總統，仍不捨舊好。每當夏秋兩季，總要駕舟出巡多决，一路釣魚尋樂。</p>
<p>總統每次出游，往往帶了一班顧問和至友。最近幾次巡游福洛利達州海濱就是這樣的。但每次所帶的朋友，各各不同。每次出游時期一天至三天，循波陀馬克河而下，入某薩比克灣，目的是鈞魚休息和乘凉。談話的資料，公事的和應酬的各佔其半。在閑散這中，略為辦理一點公事。總統喜歡在辦公室以外，運籌帷幄，他往往在旅行期間，確定各項大計。</p>
<p>「波陀馬克」號是總統的海上行宮，由海岸巡邏艦改造。這艦原名「愛利克脫拉」號，一九三六年三月羅斯福就職後，始改今名。該艇全身漆成灰色，樣子並不十分富麗，但總統極為愛好。艇身長一百六十五呎，闊廿四呎不到，排水量四百五十噸。用狄塞爾式引擎發動，每小時速率十四里。</p>
<p>游艇中層甲板上後部的佈置，最為奇特，這上面舖了一大堆厚厚的坐褥，並有幾個桌子和幾把太師椅。這塊地方在海軍語彙中名為「扇形尾」，這裹用膳游戲讀書休息，無所不宜，總統的水上生活，大半留連於此。</p>
<p>扇形尾的前面是餐窒和總統的臥室。兩室內部佈置都很簡樸，臥室中僅放一床一桌數椅而已。甲板中部是艇上官兵的住處，兼為總統的廚房。首部是艇長的私室。</p>
<p>頂上層甲板，有三處露天的地方，供海底釣魚及作日光浴之用。從中層到上層有扶梯和裝在尾部大烟囱裹的人工昇降機可通。頂層甲板上，常常擱着十八呎長的獎划捕鯨船及廿六呎長的機器捕鯨船各一艘。這些船有時放下水裹，供釣魚之用。</p>
<p>底層甲板，直對餐室和總統寢室下面，有臥室兩間，小室兩間，供總統客人五六人安息之所。甲板前部是機器間和水手臥室。大體說來，這艘游艇的設備，和別的游艇大同小異。但「波陀馬克」號裝有〇五〇口徑的高射機關槍兩座，還有防禦磁性水雷的設備。船上有水手五十名。</p>
<p>羅斯福乘艇出遊的時候，海軍部至少派驅逐艦一艘，在後護送。他在海上行宮裏所辦的公事，和華盛頓白宮裹一般無二。政府各部會如國務院及白宮，都把重要消息，傳達總統。</p>
<p>這些消息先拍給海軍無綫電台，更由該電台轉拍給遊艇，遊艇上拍華盛頓，也用這個方法轉達。華盛頓方面如有重耍公文和郵件，需要總統過目或簽署，就派海軍飛機，送往總統巡行的地方。</p>
<p>總統的海上行宮，不僅是處理國務的地方，且具有歷史上的價値。在昔年老羅斯福總統時代，日蘇樸資茅斯停戰會議陷於慍局，老羅斯福就邀請日蘇雙方代表，到他的游艇「五月華」號，勸他們諒解，獲得成功。至於「波陀馬克」號，歷史雖短，也巳創造不少歷史。此次歐戰爆發前，英皇喬治六世和皇後伊麗莎白，訪問美國，曾乘該艇自華盛頓前往維嫩山。此外，總統並和各國要人，在該艇舉行談話。</p>
<p>所以每在國際局勢緊張的時候，我們聽得美國大總統泛舟釣遊，覺得他太好整以暇，殊不知總統垂釣不忘國事呢！</p>
<p>發明</p>
<h3>新玻璃</h3>
<p>— 潔泉</p>
<p>玻璃的發明，無疑是近代文明的一大貢獻，可是通常玻璃除用來製造窗戶以及器皿以外，並無許多其他的用處，原因是玻璃容易碎裂，不易彎曲，反不及木製的器物，來得便利耐用。</p>
<p>可是近年的玻璃工業，顯然巳有極大的進步，各種新穎的玻璃，次第發明成功，以前所有的不少布製或木製的東西，都已改用玻璃製造了。</p>
<p>目今市上有一種布匹，鮮艷奪目，光耀如絲，火燒不燃，水浸不爛，這種奇異的布匹，便是用細長而可屈的玻璃絲織成的。自從美國在一九三九年起，首先大量製造此項玻璃絲以後，各國競相仿傚，預料不久的將來，世界各國的紡織業，將有重大的革新了。</p>
<p>大家都知道，保險玻璃是由兩層普通的玻璃，夾著中間一層透明的塑料而製成的。這種透明的塑料，能將裏外兩層玻璃拉住，使其不致紛碎。歐洲戰爭中各國城市的商店，便應用此項原理，去製造不碎的玻璃，俾仆空襲之時，减輕門窗等等的損害。其製法係在玻璃中夾一層細密的鉛絲網，或透明的纖維片，又有一法，係將稀鬆漏空的窗帘，貼在普通玻璃上面，再以油漆或膠水等物，將帘黏牢在玻璃之上，這樣一來，飛機轟炸之時，玻窗雖不免受震碎裂，但不致四散粉飛，傷害附近的人民了。</p>
<p>彈性玻璃又是一種極重要的化學發明。這種玻璃具有普通玻璃的各種優點，而沒有它的缺點。彈性玻璃透明光亮，可以曲折，各種液體都不能滲透它。它無臭無味不易磨損或碎裂，它也可以製成各種美麗的顏色玻璃，目前已有人用來製造褲帶，襪帶，背帶以及手提箱，手袋等等東西，並且因為在這種玻璃上面，亦可燙印金字油墨，所以也可用以裝訂書本呢。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦虔鷗</p>
<p>十　慈父的心</p>
<p>「可是這幾畝田誰種呢？」張小狗子的答覆倒也乾凈得很。</p>
<p>於是秋海棠祇能放棄搬家的計劃了，田沒有人種，甚至荒掉都沒有問題，只是一家三口的糧食，又打何處來呢？化錢去買吧，要化錢的地方太多，而他所有的錢太少了！</p>
<p>他把身子靠在廊下的木一條柱上，臉朝着天空，不覺想得出了神。</p>
<p>後來還是散課的鐘聲把他驚醒了。</p>
<p>「爸爸，下這麼大的雨，你還要自己來，你瞧：身子上全都打濕了！梅實張開着兩條纖長的手臂，像燕子掠水一樣的撲過來，抱住了秋海棠的腰，透着怪嬌痴的神氣說：「下會再是這樣，我就不跟你回去了！」</p>
<p>免患濕溫及㾏夏之苦　號</p>
<p>秋海棠卻只是微微一笑，並不說什麼話，便一手攙着她，急急忙走廊的盡頭走去；他見了梅寶的的老師和同學，心裏總是很害怕，只要躲得過去，他就絕對不希望跟他們照面。</p>
<p>將到走廊盡頭，他便蹲下了身子，想把梅寶馱起來。</p>
<p>「這樣不好，爸爸！」梅寶却執意不肯。</p>
<p>秋海棠一面很尷尬地把身子站起來，一面旋過頭去，用詢問的目光看了他女兒一眼。（一五二）</p>

<h3>眼鏡上的望遠鏡</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>為幫助某種視綫薄弱的眼病人讀書閱報起見，最近美國眼鏡製造家發明一種小望遠鏡，可以配置在普通的眼鏡上，幫助閱讀。因為有一種病人，其視力太弱，即使是普通放大力最强的眼鏡，也不能使他看書閱報。這種小型望遠鏡，製造精良，其構造與威爾遜山天文臺上世界最大的百吋望遠鏡相同，這眞是視綫薄弱者的福音</p>

<h3>新奇的選舉</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>好萊塢奇趣的事，層出不窮，最近美國有一部分海軍人員，舉辦了個新奇有趣的問題測騐，徵求答案，他們的問題是：「如果你流落在荒島上，你希望跟誰在一起？」結果以拉娜透納Lana　Turner獲得票數最多。拉娜是名音樂隊領班以單簧簫馳譽的阿蒂蕭的前妻，今巳仳離，下嫁愛麗絲費的前夫歌星湯尼馬丁，他倆自合作「齊格飛女郎」後，戀愛成熟，最近在影城茂佛大厦宣稱他倆結婚日期已定為本年九月十日，地點在勒斯維卡絲。</p>
<p>拉娜透納是大學生們心目中最崇拜的「熱女郎」偶像，在「襯衣女郎」的綽號下，對於肉體美上，她是的確具有動人的特點的。她的大膽的袒胸裸臂的衣服，在好萊塢是最受人注意，不但在銀幕上如此，就在公共塲所也是如此，因此她那富於誘惑性的大膽作風，是比「唔女郎」安秀麗丹更引人迷戀。</p>
<p>一般投票選舉她的海軍人員，都認為如果跟她一同流落在荒島上，就是一生不再回到文明世界上，也不會感到枯燥失望的了。</p>
<h3>英茵將演舞台劇</h3>
<p>— 卜敏</p>
<p>英茵自返滬以來，她的作品很少與觀衆相見，這也許是愼重的緣故吧，當然，「賽金花」和「返魂香」是有相當成就的，所以大家對於這位藝人的期望也格外來得大。</p>
<p>風傳已久的「世界兒女」，據說將在秋凉與觀衆見面，這部戲乃是英茵及司馬英才等主演的，故事是述兩個孤兒的戀愛和成功史，英茵飾一孤兒，寄養在一個木匠家裹，從小經過種種磨難，甚至被迫充當舞女，可是她却能努力奮鬥，達到成功的目的。民華公司特請德籍佛萊克夫婦導演，可見得鄭重無比。</p>
<p>其實在「世界女兒」未演映以前，英茵可以有一個機會為觀衆見到眞面目，那便是在天風演出「淸宮怨」，「淸宮怨」是一齣相當偉大的話劇，這在各報都會先後看到過消息，現正由費穆導演趕排，據說手法極其新穎。</p>
<p>英茵在「淸宮怨」裹是飾珍妃一角，有人以為「淸宮怨」該是全以西太后的史實為主，因為根據民問傳說等，都將西太后認為比武則天還要偉大，實在據正確的考證，西太后並沒有多大的事績値得叙述，按當年的政治情形，光緒和珍妃其實倒是主要人物，珍妃是一位美麗而英明的女子，抱着滿腔正義與熱血，想把國家振興，但結果被惡勢力所壓迫，以致投井而死，姚克編寫該劇，就以珍妃光緒為主要角色，因此由英茵來担任了。</p>
<p>據悉這部戲大約在十七日左右可以演出，是英茵返滬後上舞台的第一砲，料想無數觀衆正在渴望着呢！</p>
<h3>張翼鵬排演太平天國</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>「太平天國」是偉大的歷史劇，以前華藝影片公司曾拍攝影片，不久中旅演出的「洪宜嬌」，亦即是採取這裹面的一段故事。最近記者探悉更新舞台也要排演這齣戲了。</p>
<p>更新的上演「太平天國」，很早就醞釀着濃厚的空氣，以前傳說張翼鵬要自己寫劇本，現在我們可以揭示這謎語似的幕幔了。</p>
<p>劇本的內容，決定採取三個提綱：（一）張翼鵬自己擬的。（二）參考共舞台的「紅羊豪俠傳」。（三）何海生搜集的材料。—把這三點合而為一，便成為即將演出的「太平天國」。</p>
<p>頭本戲的情節，自林則徐被參起，到金田村起義止，裹面也穿挿着洪宜嬌和蕭朝貴的羅曼史。張翼鵬去韋昌輝，劉文魁演洪秀全，做工都很吃重。武生方面，由梁熙超，王富英等參加，演保良攻匪會的開打塲面，絕對結棍。</p>
<p>這幾天，張翼鵬正流着汗，督率全體工作人員，加緊趕排中，大約本星期日或下星期日，即可演出。他們只演星期日，而且只演日塲。</p>
<p>我很喜歡「太平天國」的故事，希望此次演出，能給予我們一種正義感的刺激，而不是無聊的，貧乏的。</p>
<h3>滬上各舞台「武生」漫談（四）</h3>
<p>— 景春</p>
<p>王筱芳　大舞臺武生王筱芳，現正壯年時代，隨林樹森配演各戲有年，為林伶夾袋中之人物也。其擅劇亦甚夥，武工堅挺不凡，身材雖矮小，扮相極雍貴，能飾周瑜呂布等角，尚屬可觀。把靠戲如「長板坡」「冀州城」「越虎城」等齣，為其拿手，短打亦無所不能，跌撲俱見功夫，故臺主林樹森倚畀至殷。、惟近時在「神怪劍俠傳」中去賈明，滑稽發噱，殊堪捧腹。</p>
<p>趙松樵　說起趙松樵，他在梨園中的資格倒很老的，向隸共舞臺懸首牌歷時甚久，文武唱做各劇俱能，固亦大雜拌之一。對所演之戲，極肯賣力，一舉一動，用足勁道，為其他武生所不敵，因此也博得一般觀客所讚美。自人天蟾後，陳鶴峯的滿告退，由他獨當一面；然而「黃天霸」的本戲以叫座力略减，遂聘京角鬚生宋實羅登臺，位居宋下。關於趙伶之武生戲，當以靠把見長，昔日演來，有聲有色，足可一觀。今則無一齣純粹正派之武劇可一飽顧曲者，專以做派取勝焉。</p>

<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十二章　盡如寗武可奈何</p>
<p>下午又來攻城，周遇吉再敎開砲，一連三日，把賊兵打得叫苦連天，總計折損的有萬人。李自成大怒道：「周遇吉如此可惡！我若不破寗武，誓不生還」。牛金星獻計道：「周遇吉雖勇武善守，然若我們攻打不休，他沒有外來的救援，早晚必為我破。不如將部下分為十隊，輪流攻打，待他們開砲時，我們停止進攻，砲止後繼續攻城，務使城上沒有喘息的餘暇而我們反可以逸待勞，乘機進擊。李自成贊許牛金星的主張，於是把部下兒郎分為十隊。步騎相併，每隊人數千名左右，建着各色的旗幟，以為識別，畫夜進攻。不幸的關上的砲雖然無恙，而火藥已盡，祇能節省燃放。流寇見城上砲聲已稀，便大膽擁上。周遇吉便聚集弓弩手射放。只見賊兵一隊來，一隊去，輪流攻打第一隊是用紅色的旗，賊將一隻虎督率，攻打得最厲害。第二隊是用靑色的旗，賊將滿天星統率，弓弩最多。專射火箭。第三隊是用黃色的旗，賊將在金虎統率，雲梯最多。第四隊是用黑色的旗，大多數是騎兵，賊將射塌天率領。其餘第五隊用紫色的旗，第六隊用白色，第七隊用藍色，第八隊用淡紅色，第九隊用赭石色，第十隊用灰色。五花八門，陸離光怪，使關上的官兵為之應接不暇。接連又是五天，官軍果然都累得疲乏了。牛金星又敎賊兵在箭上縛着勸降的書，紛紛射到城墻上來。官軍，拾得拿給周遇吉去看。周遇吉恐怕士心動搖，遂召集將士們勸諭道：「前三日內殺賊萬人，今雖彈藥缺乏，尚可持久作戰。能够得勝，一軍盡為忠義，否則縛我獻賊也好。」衆將士都涕泣從命，誓死堅守。（一〇九）</p>

<h3>Central Government Commemorates the Fourth Anniversary of the War of Resistance with a Military Review and Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers; Chongqing City Adorned with Flags, Government Offices Maintain Normal Operations, National Defense Exhibition and Round Table Conferences Held</h3>
<p>This morning's ceremonies in Chongqing commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War were temporarily disrupted by Japanese aircraft. Twenty-seven Japanese planes fiercely bombed the western suburbs, their primary target seemingly the press hostel, which has been bombed repeatedly. Foreign correspondents are currently residing in this hostel. A large bomb landed near the hostel, and another landed directly in front of its entrance, causing a fire. Several bombs also fell along the Yangtze River. It was found that last night, twenty-three Japanese planes, divided into three groups, bombed this area, concentrating their bombs on the courtyard where the press hostel is located. One bomb scored a direct hit, destroying the dining room. Another exploded on the lawn ten yards from the hostel entrance. A third bomb landed but did not detonate. Another bomb landed outside the entrance of an air raid shelter, where the flash of the explosion could be seen inside. Those taking shelter were greatly shaken, but fortunately, there were no casualties. However, one person nearby was killed by the bombing. Today, the city is adorned with flags, and government offices are maintaining normal operations. Unlike previous years, entertainment venues are not closed, but the performances are all patriotic dramas. A military review was held in the morning, presided over by Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie. After the review, Social Affairs Minister Gu Zhenggang conducted a simple memorial service for the fallen soldiers. Three national defense exhibitions are being held in the city, and round table conferences are being held in multiple locations to discuss the development of the international situation. The National Relief Commission has dispatched several groups to visit the families of frontline soldiers, distributing gifts and letters. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Commemoration Meetings Held Across Various Locations; Telegrams Sent to Lin and Chiang Expressing Respect</h3>
<p>Xi'an: The Shaanxi community representatives commemorated the fourth anniversary of the War of Resistance by holding a public memorial service for fallen soldiers at 6:00 AM today. Xiong Bin presided over the ceremony, which was very solemn. At 7:00 AM, a review of the entire city's militia was conducted. At 6:00 PM, a commemorative meeting was held by over ten thousand people from all walks of life in Xincheng, with extremely enthusiastic sentiments. Xiong Bin presided over the meeting, reporting on the significance of the commemoration. Next, a telegram was passed to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to express respect and to offer condolences to the soldiers. After the meeting, a lantern parade was held, passing through all the streets and alleys of the city, with an unprecedentedly grand scene, only dispersing at 7:00 PM. (Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Chengdu: Representatives from various circles in Rong [Chengdu] held a commemorative meeting for the fourth anniversary of the War of Resistance at 7:00 AM on the 7th, with over ten thousand people in attendance. Zhang Qun presided over the meeting, first conducting a review of the national militia, followed by a public memorial service for fallen soldiers and Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan. Everyone observed three minutes of silence. Then, the chairman reported on the significance of the commemoration. A telegram was passed on the spot to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to express respect and to send condolences to the soldiers at the front. Sentiments were extremely enthusiastic, and the meeting only dispersed at noon. (Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Kunming: Representatives from various circles in Yunnan held a commemorative meeting for the fourth anniversary of the War of Resistance this afternoon. Long Yun personally presided over the meeting, launching an on-the-spot war bond subscription campaign. Long Yun took the lead in advocating, resulting in 30 million yuan. Various circles also held a donation competition, raising over 100,000 yuan. The meeting also passed telegrams to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to express respect, as well as telegrams of condolence to the soldiers at the front. (Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Erupts Southwest of Zhao'an</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It is reported that over a thousand Japanese soldiers landed near Zhao'an on the southern coast of Fujian province on July 4th. Skirmishes are currently underway to the southwest and west of the city. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing, Military News: 1. It is confirmed that Japanese Unit Commander Yoshida was killed by Chinese troops in the Battle of Dahu, northwest of Fuzhou. The Japanese army transported the body to Fuzhou for cremation and held a memorial service. 2. On the 29th of last month, a convoy of Japanese trucks fully loaded with Japanese soldiers invaded from Yongle Town to the west, driving towards Mouyuan Village. They were hit by Chinese mobile artillery, destroying several Japanese trucks and killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers. (Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Times Praises China's Heroic Resistance</h3>
<p>London: The Times today published an editorial commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that China has now sent one of its most outstanding talents, Wellington Koo, to be its representative in the heart of the democratic resistance against rampant violence. Koo will be the "spokesman for countries continuing to resist aggression." While the experiences of many Western countries have been tragic, it is questionable whether any country other than Poland has suffered the systematic brutality experienced by China. The paper also stated that, along with the bravery of the Chinese army and the long-term endurance of the Chinese people, the indomitable spirit of the Chinese leaders is worthy of admiration. The Matsuoka-Soviet Pact has not shaken General Chiang Kai-shek's determination, as he has maintained a firm attitude of non-compromise since the outbreak of the war, just like British Prime Minister Churchill. This proves that both the pessimists on the Chinese side and the optimists on the Japanese side have overestimated the importance of this agreement. Soviet aid to China may be reduced due to Hitler's great interest in invading Soviet territory, but the Soviet Union is now fighting on the same side as China, Britain, and the United States. In any case, the truce between the Chinese government and the Communist army in China is unlikely to be broken again, as Japan hopes. Loans from Britain and the United States, and the British ambassador's firm assurance that the Burma Road will remain open, are effective counterattacks against Japanese propaganda and provide great comfort to worried Chinese. The Chinese deeply believe that their future stability and prosperity are linked to Western democracy, and they now hope to receive greater assistance. The leaders of the English-speaking world deeply admire this long-standing and unconquerable people for their long and glorious resistance, and they will carefully study how to assist them in their struggle.

<h3>American Newspapers Unanimously Praise China's Growing Strength</h3>
<p>New York: In today's commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, the comments from various newspapers in the Scripps-Howard chain across the United States all say, "China is stronger than before, while Japan is weakening." The newspapers' comments also state, "The result of the aggression is that China has gained a truly national army and national spirit for the first time in history. The supposedly disunited China now wants to defend itself and tomorrow may challenge Japanese aggression elsewhere and liberate the neighboring peoples of Manchuria, Korea, and Vietnam." (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: Paul V. McNutt, the US Federal Security Administrator, who has always advocated a strong Far East policy, addressed Chinese groups here today on the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, praising China's successful resistance. He said, "The time to clarify the Pacific problem has come." He predicted China's final victory, which would result in the restoration of peace in the Far East. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Invasion of China for Four Years Causes Major Economic Panic</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Editorials in local newspapers today all discussed the significance of Japan's four years of fighting in China. The Foreign Ministry's official newspaper, Japan Public Knowledge News, stated that Japan has weathered the storm. Its position after four years of fighting is the best evidence of the efficiency and ability of the nation. After four years of fighting, there are two phenomena: one is the rapid progress of reconstruction in China after the ravages of war, and the other is the gradual increase in the Japanese side's methods of fighting and defense behind the front lines. Japan's protracted war in China has undoubtedly affected the economic and social life of the Japanese people, and although it has suffered damage and hardship during the four years of fighting, Japan is far stronger and more productive today than it was four years ago.

<h3>Clearing Up the Speculative Market</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council took on the responsibility of transporting and selling foreign rice, the price of rice in Shanghai has stabilized, and the general population that was crying out for food has been able to catch their breath slightly. The Shanghai Municipal Council's determination, willpower, and swift methods are truly commendable.</p>
<p>However, the lesson that the people have learned from the rising rice prices over the past few months has not only prevented them from becoming the starving dead trampled under the feet of the wealthy merchants due to hunger and cold, but it has also promoted the cultivation of civic spirit and frugality. This can almost be said to be a blessing in disguise! However, rice is one of the necessary conditions for life, and there are many other problems related to food, clothing, housing, and transportation that urgently need to be solved.</p>
<p>If the recent soaring price of coal is any indication, the cruel impact on the lives of citizens is no different from that of rice; and when examining the reasons for the soaring price, there is nothing that can be established except for speculation and monopolies. Since coal from various places along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line to this city, as well as fuel coal from coastal defense areas, can be continuously transported to Shanghai to meet the market demand. If merchants are obsessed and use excuses to raise prices, then the concession authorities can only resolutely and decisively take over the exclusive sale of coal and prevent speculation in daily necessities. The crux of the problem today lies entirely in the manipulation of distribution, rather than a problem of insufficient supply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the supply of water and electricity and public transportation fares have recently been increased repeatedly. The citizens are suffering from the burden of not being able to afford it. It is found that the income of each of these companies has had a surplus every year, but they still think that they are not satisfied and must satisfy their predetermined profits. This truly runs counter to the purpose and morality of business operations in extraordinary times. It is also something that is not allowed by any country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the landlords in this city have been able to deeply understand the greater good and have not raised rents. The court's mediation of rent disputes also takes the livelihood of the people as the premise, so the citizens have benefited greatly. However, recently there have been many people advocating for the revaluation of land prices to serve as a basis for enriching tax revenue. If this is the case, then the increase in rent is inevitable, and it goes without saying that the burden will be shifted to the citizens.</p>
<p>In summary, each of the above points has a direct and significant relationship with the lives of the people and must be corrected one by one in order to guide life on the right track. The reason why the lives of the citizens of Shanghai have been in such a serious situation must be blamed on the speculative transactions of the stock exchange in this city. Let us present the current situation to prove our point. Although margin trading, foreign exchange, raw cotton, stocks, and public bonds may have occasional arbitrage and investment transactions, they do not seem to be regarded as gambling-style speculation, but when examining the actual situation, nine out of ten are gambling. Traders have absolutely no desire to receive cash or deliver goods, but are absolutely buying long and selling short to make a profit from the difference between the entry and exit prices. The largest scale of such transactions is the trading of margin trading (commonly known in the market as "hot red" or "strips"). According to recent estimates by experts, the funds for margin trading are between 200 million yuan and 250 million yuan, and the highest estimate is 600 million yuan. According to the spot goods of margin trading in Shanghai, there are about 5,000 strips (each strip weighing ten taels), and the daily margin trading, whether long (buying long) or short (selling short), always exceeds 50,000 strips. If each strip is calculated at a market price of 6,500 yuan, and one day's trading is based on 10,000 strips, then the daily trading volume is 65 million yuan; compared with the weekly trading volume of 30 million yuan in Shanghai stock trading (this is the figure for the first week of June), there is a world of difference. Even the trading of the foreign exchange market cannot be compared with margin trading; recently, the long positions of margin trading that were made up due to the short positions of 10 million yuan in US exchange are only a very small part of the monthly margin trading.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the above-mentioned margin trading market is the champion of various speculative transactions. From an economic point of view, speculative transactions were originally not objectionable and have their uses; however, the transactions in the Shanghai market are not all speculation with economic functions, and most of them are harmful gambling that harms the lives of the people. We have analyzed them briefly above. This is why the speculative market in Shanghai must be cleared up. Furthermore, the margin trading affects people's hearts, even making them lose their minds for profit; other businesses also follow suit. All of this is caused by the margin trading. Therefore, if we want to clear up speculation in Shanghai and stabilize the lives of millions of residents, we must not succeed in banning the speculative transactions of the margin trading market. When the Shanghai Municipal Council raised the issue of revenue and expenditure in the past, there were no shortage of Westerners who suggested imposing heavy taxes on margin trading and all speculative transactions, prohibiting them through taxation, killing two birds with one stone, but unfortunately, it has not been implemented.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the concessions in Shanghai have been able to present an abnormally developed prosperity by means of speculative transactions, because the five million people who fled to the concessions have been able to directly or indirectly assist in supporting the speculative market. The maintenance of speculative transactions depends on the willingness of women, children, and retail investors to take out their wallets and make a desperate bet, just like birds and sparrows being hunted by hawks and eagles. It is also like a fish that can swallow a boat, which depends entirely on the water to help it. Now the pool water has dried up, and the fish that can swallow a boat has no place to use its force. When it waits for its downfall, the cruelty of the market reaction cannot be described in words!</p>
<p>After decades of exploitation by various parties in Shanghai, the foundation of speculation has long been shaken; in recent years, it has been temporarily active due to the stimulation of hot money, but the imminent end of speculation has long been recognized by the wise. If the concession authorities can plan with all relevant parties as soon as possible, stop gambling-style transactions, and establish a model for a normal life in Shanghai, then it may not be too late to benefit from the setting sun; otherwise, if it is allowed to change naturally and cause a reaction, the harm and disaster it will cause are truly unspeakable and unbearable.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Reviews the War Situation of the Past Four Years; Expresses Optimism About the Future of the War; Strong Chinese Air Force Has Shot Down Thousands of Japanese Aircraft; Significant Progress Has Been Made in Political, Economic, and Transportation Construction</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Sino-Japanese War has now lasted four years. Minister of the Army He Yingqin recently published an article reviewing the fourth year of the war and expressing optimism about the future of the war. He said that although the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to break through the Chinese army's front lines in recent months, the Chinese army is still firmly defending the 2,800-mile-long front line from north to south. It is estimated that by the end of 1940, the Japanese had suffered more than 1.6 million casualties in China. The Chinese army has more than 300 divisions, totaling 5 million people on the ground, and there are another 10 million reserve soldiers or those undergoing training in the rear. There are more than 800,000 guerrillas harassing Japanese troops and transportation lines, and no fewer than 600,000 regular troops fighting behind Japanese lines. The greatest victory of the Chinese army in the fourth year was the battle in early February of this year. At that time, the Japanese army divided its troops into three routes and invaded southern Henan, penetrating 280 miles in a week, but once the supply line was stretched, the Chinese army launched a counterattack and recovered all the lost territory in a week, inflicting heavy casualties of 20,000 on the enemy. According to official figures released by the Chinese Air Force, the Chinese side has destroyed more than 1,000 Japanese aircraft in the four years of the Sino-Japanese War, of which 321 were shot down by Chinese aircraft, 250 were destroyed on the ground, 170 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, 136 were shot down by land defense forces, 97 were destroyed by guerrillas, and 45 crashed behind or near Chinese army lines. The number of Japanese aircraft that were damaged and unable to return to their defenses and those that crashed behind their own lines were not included in this number. The Chinese side captured 54 Japanese pilots and found more than 1,200 Japanese pilot corpses. The Chinese Air Force is temporarily inactive except for a few bombing raids, but it may take the offensive again this summer. American pilots who have come to China to serve according to the American aid-to-China program are already on their way. The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, as the highest governing body, held two congresses this year, one in July 1940, the Seventh National Congress, and the eighth in March and April of this year. According to the decision of the congress, the Central Planning Bureau and the Party and Government Work Inspection Committee were established. The former prepares and studies plans for various political, economic, and post-war reconstruction programs, and the latter reviews the achievements of the party and government. The Executive Yuan also established an economic conference to coordinate the affairs of relevant departments. The most important bill passed by the Eighth National Congress was the three-year plan for wartime construction. This plan specifies the start of implementation, and the six months from July to December of this year are the preparatory period. The main purpose of this move is to increase China's ability to fight, build during wartime, and build after the war. The National Assembly, which was postponed due to the war in 1937, was originally scheduled to be convened in Chongqing on November 12, 1940, but due to inconvenient transportation and other reasons, it was postponed again, so the National Political Council was reorganized and expanded to temporarily replace the work of the National Assembly during the war. At the same time, the government is also promoting local autonomy procedures, establishing provincial assemblies and implementing the new county system. It is expected that they will be implemented one after another by the end of next year. Although two-thirds of China's railways are in Japanese hands, China is rushing to build new railways and highways in the interior. Since the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was cut off, the Burma Road has been the only supplier to China. At the beginning of this year, the Chinese and British governments agreed to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway from the border to [lacuna] with British capital. The Longhai Railway has been extended in the northwest, and another branch line connects Xi'an with the [lacuna] coal area. New railways in the five provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan are also being laid. It is estimated that there are currently at least 6,000 trucks traveling on newly built highways such as the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, the Sichuan-Xikang Highway, the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, and the Xikang-Yunnan Highway. The international airline routes operated by the Sino-American Aviation Corporation include the Chongqing-Hong Kong line and the Chongqing-Yangon line, allowing Chongqing to reach San Francisco in eight days, New York and Washington in nine days, Calcutta in two days, Europe via the Americas in eleven days, Singapore in two days, and Sydney in seven days. A new air route to India is also being planned. China's ancient post stations have now been restored. The government is now using manpower and livestock to transport goods along the ten major post roads of 20,000 kilometers in 13 provinces, reaching 100,000 tons per year, and there are more than 15,000 ships currently traveling on inland rivers, with a total load of 250,000 tons. There are currently 66,000 post offices in the free zone, of which 6,000 are newly opened. The postal route is a total of 500,000 kilometers. The number of 73,000 kilometers of telegraph lines in China before the war has now been almost exceeded by the number of lines in the free zone alone. Since the beginning of the war, 33,000 kilometers of new lines have been planted, and another 12,000 kilometers are currently being worked on. The installation of long-distance telephone lines in the northwestern and southwestern provinces is also being promoted. The National Resources Commission has established more than 70 industrial factories in various parts of China, including 29 for industry, 22 for mining, and 20 for machinery. With government assistance, 450 factories have moved to the interior, with a total of 116,275 tons of equipment. Coal mines in the interior now produce 500,000 tons per year. It is reported that the oil wells in Gansu have greatly increased oil production. Iron mines in Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces alone produce more than 250,000 tons of iron per year. Yunnan province produces 10,000 tons of tin per year. The tung oil production in the interior can be increased to 1.3 million dan in five years. Tea production in Sichuan and Xikang provinces can reach 500,000 dan in five years. The silk production in the southwest is expected to reach 160,000 tons. The ports in the free zone had a trade surplus in 1940, with imports of 57,209,000 yuan and exports of 137,184,000 yuan. The center of trade has now shifted from Hong Kong to Yangon. In 1940, China's tung oil exports to the United States reached 254,102 metric tons (December rice included). Half of the silk exported from Sichuan province is now purchased by Yangon, and the rest is shipped to the United States. The figures for China's war budget have not been released, but it is reported from official sources that the budget figures for the three years from 1939 to 1941 have greatly increased due to the war. The actual expenditure in 1939 reached the sum of the two years of 1937 and 1938. The expenditure in 1940 increased by 40% compared with the previous year, and the budgeted expenditure for 1941 increased by about 65% compared with 1940. It is found that of the expenditure in 1940, 70% was used for national defense, while of the budgeted expenditure for 1941, 39% was used for war expenses, and the economic construction expenditure also reached 30%. By the end of last year, the government had raised eight domestic public bonds, totaling 14,750,000,000 yuan. As of the end of April this year, savings bonds worth 312,240,000 yuan had been sold. In 1940, the four national banks reported that savings had increased by 1,500,000,000 yuan compared with 1939. The amount of banknotes issued in July 1937 was 1,444,000,000 yuan, and it has gradually increased to seven times that amount. The government is currently collecting land tax in kind, with the land tax revenue before the war reaching 100 million yuan per year. The National Relief Commission is using work as relief to arrange work for 1 million refugees and distributing 11 million yuan to relieve 8,000 war orphans. The 8.5 million overseas Chinese have donated 300 million yuan to China's relief funds from the beginning of the war to the end of 1940, of which one-third came from Southeast Asia. After the start of the war, remittances from overseas Chinese reached 2 billion yuan, and 1 billion yuan was donated in 1940 alone. Chongqing is 1,500 miles from Shanghai and used to have a population of 700,000, but it has been reduced to 400,000 due to Japanese bombing. The most severe bombings were on May 3, 1939, with thousands of casualties, and on August 19 of last year, when 250 Japanese aircraft attacked, four-fifths of the area downstream of Chongqing was reduced to ashes, but new houses were built soon after. There are currently 1,000 air-raid shelters in Chongqing, which can accommodate 40,000 people. There are 32 warning stations watching for Japanese aircraft. It is estimated that in 1939, every two bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft on Chongqing caused 11 casualties. Last year, this number was reduced to two, and this year, every three and a half bombs cause only one casualty. According to official records, the total number of casualties is 8,000.

<h3>Japanese Minister of Agriculture Urges Japanese People to Reduce Food Consumption; Successive Years of Poor Harvests Lead to a Sense of Food Shortage, Necessitating Increased Agricultural Control</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7 (United Press) – The Minister of Agriculture, Ino, broadcasted on the radio, warning the people that Japan may need to further reduce its food consumption in the future. However, he assured that Japan's food supply would be sufficient in any emergency. Ino stated that the food problem often determines the outcome of a war, and the people should endure the hardships of the food problem in order to safely navigate Japan's shortage of rice and food production due to the shortage of farmers and fertilizers, as well as droughts and pests. The government has now adopted a "twelve-year plan" to increase rice and wheat production and will strive to encourage the cultivation of sweet potatoes. The government's plan also includes increasing rice imports from overseas to compensate for the deficiencies of past years. The fertilizer problem is particularly severe, as the German-Soviet war has abruptly disrupted transportation between Germany and Japan. The last European war was decided by the food problem, and the same will be true this time. Japan has suffered successive years of poor harvests, necessitating that the government implement agricultural controls. The sudden changes in the international situation are greatly relevant to Japan and cannot be ignored. We must think carefully to determine the future of the nation. The government has two ways to solve the food problem, and it will implement both simultaneously: one is to increase production under government management, and the other is to reduce consumption under government control. The price limit for rice will also be raised to encourage production and prevent waste.</p>
<h3>British Tobacco Company Encourages People to Smoke Less</h3>
<p>London, July 7 (Reuters) – Lord Dulverton, Chairman of the British Imperial Tobacco Company, speaking last night as a representative of the major British tobacco manufacturers, obtained approval from the Board of Trade to broadcast a speech urging smokers to voluntarily reduce their consumption of cigarettes in order to conserve stocks. He stated that if smokers reduce their consumption by twelve percent starting tomorrow for two months, then all cigarette stores will be able to maintain small inventories, avoiding panic buying and hoarding. This is not to discourage the public from smoking after meals or during leisure time, but casual smoking during the day can be reduced. It is best to limit daily consumption to a certain amount to test how much can be reduced. If we are frugal, we will have plenty of cigarettes and tobacco.</p>
<h3>Notion of Dutch Government Moving to America Unlikely to Materialize</h3>
<p>Batavia, July 7 (Reuters) – According to informed sources, the notion of the Dutch government relocating from London to Washington is unlikely to materialize in any way. It is heard that this proposal was put forward by only a few members of the People's Council.</p>

<h3>Large Numbers of American Ships Transporting Military Supplies to Reinforce British Forces in the Middle East; No Shortage of Aircraft or Tanks; British Position in the Mediterranean Has Improved</h3>
<p>Washington, July 7 (Reuters) – According to official sources familiar with the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, 20 to 25 ships are currently transporting military supplies to reinforce British forces in the Middle East each month. The goods shipped across the Atlantic and Pacific now include bombers, fighter planes, artillery, ammunition, and new 13-ton tanks. Some of these weapons have already been used on the battlefield, and mechanics have arrived in Egypt to oversee the assembly of aircraft. Officials estimate that it takes 100 days from the time of loading at US ports to the time of unloading in the Red Sea. However, loading is now being expedited, so American military experts are becoming less pessimistic about Britain's chances of maintaining control of the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3>Singapore Supplies Tin and Rubber to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Singapore, July 7 (United Press) – The Straits Settlements government today declined to comment on reports of rubber and tin being shipped to the Soviet Union. However, market sources said the news was very significant. Although it is unknown who is representing the Soviet Union as the buyer, it is expected that steps will be taken to limit prices. To the level that American buyers currently pay for rubber. Previously, some parties had paid little attention to the tin market, but suddenly there has been a great demand for tin this past week, which is worth noting. Shipping circles claim that although there are large stocks of rubber, two American freighters that left here last week did not carry them, indicating that the stocks have been used for other purposes. Official statistics show that 398,268 tons of rubber were exported in the first half of this year, compared to 365,667 tons in the same period last year.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Gathers Fresh Troops; Switches from Defense to Offense in Various Areas; Fiercest Fighting in the Central Sector; German Forces Suffer Setbacks in Ostrov</h3>
<p>Moscow, July 7 (United Press) – The official Soviet war communiqué has indicated that powerful Red Army forces have joined the war and that the Soviet side has begun to take the initiative, stating that Soviet forces have launched two counter-offensives and that German forces on all fronts have been stalled. The tone of this communiqué is very different from that of the previous few days, forcefully stating that Soviet forces are strongly resisting large German tank and motorized infantry divisions. The tone of the communiqué is quite forceful, stating that Soviet forces are no longer relying solely on defensive tactics or defensive counter-offensives but have dispatched unused reserves to attack the long-fighting and fatigued German forces.</p>
<p>Moscow, July 7 (United Press) – The Red Army Supreme Command has thrown a large number of fresh troops into the Stalin Line, 360 miles west of Moscow, to vigorously counterattack the German vanguard. Fiercest battles are taking place in the central sector, 500 miles long. The Soviet side claims that the German advance has been stopped.</p>
<p>Moscow, July 7 (Reuters) – A Soviet communiqué issued this morning claims that Soviet forces have achieved considerable success in counter-offensives in many areas of the long front line. It is reported that German forces in the Ostrov region on the Latvian border have been forced to adopt a defensive posture after suffering heavy setbacks in a Soviet counter-offensive. Also, in the Borisov region, where German forces are currently attempting to break through to Moscow, a major battle occurred yesterday after Soviet forces launched a counter-offensive against Nazi mechanized units. The German attempt to forcibly cross the Berezina River in the Bobruysk region is reported to have been repelled with heavy losses. Soviet forces are resisting the advance of German mechanized units in the Novograd-Volynsky and Volynsk regions.</p>
<p>Moscow, July 7 (TASS) – The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following recent battle report: "On the night of the 6th, fierce battles continued in the Ostrov, Polotsk, Borisov, and Novograd-Volynsky sectors, as well as on the Bessarabian front. Local battles and forward outpost activities took place in other sectors. The details are as follows: (1) Fierce battles raged throughout the night in the Ostrov sector. Fighting continues this morning. (2) In the Polotsk sector, our forces repelled enemy attacks and firmly defended the Dvina River line. Heavy fighting near the river resulted in tens of thousands of enemy corpses and destroyed enemy tanks and aircraft remaining on the battlefield. Most of the attacking enemy forces have been buried in the riverbed. (3) Heavy fighting took place on the night of the 5th in the Borisov sector. Our forces are conducting a counter-offensive, and the battle is continuing. (4) Enemy attacks in the Bobruysk sector have been repelled repeatedly, with the enemy suffering heavy losses. (5) In the Novograd-Volynsky sector, our forces are stopping the advance of large enemy mechanized units. (6) In the Bessarabian sector, a large number of German and Romanian cavalry and tanks attempted to advance in the Bălți sector, but they were forced to retreat due to the heroic resistance of our forces. (7) 61 enemy aircraft were shot down on July 4 (the previously reported 43 were inaccurate). We also lost 29 aircraft."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Launches Collective Guerrilla Warfare in German-Occupied Territories</h3>
<p>Moscow, July 7 (TASS) – In enemy-occupied territories, our people have spontaneously launched collective guerrilla warfare. Familiar with the terrain, they bravely attack the rear of the fascist aggressors. The German side is rushing to repair the destroyed bridges and, at the same time, must station troops at various points to protect the rear due to the activities of the guerrillas. Although German fascist censorship is extremely strict, the heroic exploits of the guerrillas are still being reported in foreign newspapers. A Berlin correspondent for the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that guerrilla activity in the rear of the fascist forces has slowed down the German advance and caused panic among the German forces. German couriers and transport trucks are frequently attacked, forcing the German side to dispatch tanks and other units to protect them. Some Soviet citizens captured an officer from the German 33rd Infantry Regiment, who claimed that they were forced to fight against the Soviet Union. Also, German pilot Wilhelm Hanner, captured by the Red Army, admitted that the German Air Force has never encountered an enemy as strong as the Soviet Air Force.</p>
<p>London, July 7 (Reuters) – Moscow's Pravda stated today that the Soviet Union is facing great danger. At the same time, reports from all sides indicate that the German side is encountering greater difficulties than expected. According to a report from Sulek, German newspapers state that after the German forces invaded Soviet territory, their rear and flanks have repeatedly encountered unexpected resistance. An analysis in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung acknowledges that the strong resistance of Soviet forces has forced the German side to repeatedly dispatch fresh troops to assist in the fighting, a number larger than originally thought necessary. Other reports indicate that the German side is eager to know the number of Soviet reserves, knowing that they will clash with Soviet reserves when they reach the Stalin Line. The German side also cited weather difficulties. Their official news agency stated that Soviet forces set fire to the forests during their retreat. However, German forces continue to advance in several locations. Recent reports indicate that Soviet forces are currently under considerable pressure in certain sectors.</p>
<h3>Berlin Reports German Infantry Breaching the Stalin Line</h3>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (United Press) – It is reported that powerful units of German infantry breached the "impregnable" Stalin Line yesterday and captured a heavily defended trench after 50,000 encircled Red Army soldiers surrendered. To date, 300,000 Red Army soldiers have been captured. Powerful German mechanized units are now reportedly 300 miles from Moscow and advancing in three directions: one targeting Leningrad, one targeting Moscow, and one targeting Kyiv. The German official news agency claims that the trenches captured by German forces "contained the latest artillery equipment." The vanguard of German infantry, who forcibly crossed the Dnieper River to attack the Soviet Union's strongest fortress, may have breached the Stalin Line near Orsha, following the Minsk-Moscow highway. Orsha is located between Minsk and Smolensk, but the Germans have not explicitly announced the point of breakthrough. The German official news agency acknowledges that large Soviet forces are still holding the northern forests. These Soviet forces are currently disrupting the German rear, frequently attacking Nazi rear communications and supply convoys. A reporter from the propaganda agency behind the Finnish front stated that the Leningrad-Murmansk railway has been cut by German air force at numerous points, preventing the Red Army from reinforcing Murmansk. It was also stated that the German Air Force has conducted extensive mine-laying operations in the Soviet Arctic Ocean, White Sea, and along the banks of the important White Sea-Baltic Canal.</p>
<h3>Soviet and German Navies Clash; Two German Destroyers Sunk</h3>
<p>Moscow, July 7 (United Press) – Soviet military intelligence reported that there was a naval battle in the Gulf of Riga on July 6. German naval forces were repelled, and two German destroyers were sunk. At the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, an enemy submarine detonated a mine.</p>

<h3>China's Four Years of Struggle Have Laid the Foundation for Nation-Building; The Anti-Aggression Frontline Holds the Belief That Justice Will Prevail Over Might</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" commented on China's four years of war yesterday in an article entitled "Four Years of War." The translation of the original article is as follows: "The Sino-Japanese War broke out four years ago today, and has now evolved from a local incident into a full-scale war, and has even triggered a world war. The ongoing European war is undoubtedly a consequence of the Asian war. The Japanese invasion of North China in 1937 set a precedent for the German destruction of peace in Europe two years later.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Resisting Aggression Connects the People of Europe and Asia. Resistance to aggression has had a spiritual connection from the beginning, but it is only today that it is recognized by the nations of the world who are determined to eliminate violence. Therefore, the entry of the Sino-Japanese War into its fifth year is worthy of the world's attention. The Sino-Japanese War has almost proven to us an unwavering belief: that no matter how superior a militaristic country's army is, no matter how vast the territory it has occupied, if the other side does not admit defeat, the aggressor cannot claim victory.</p>
<p>Britain's Understanding of China is a Model. No army can fight alone for a long time. If it wants to succeed, it must gain the support of the people. Today, all-powerful nations only whip their people, and cannot be said to have cooperation between the army and the people. It is only to be expected that they cannot fight for a long time. China has fought for four years, and has lost no less than thousands of square miles of land, and countless lives and property. However, it still holds the belief that 'justice will prevail over might' and has not diminished in the slightest. China has been able to build a nation during the war for the past few years, and it is based on this. Those in the world who want to have great fearlessness should take heroic China as a model, and then they can increase their courage and realize their hopes."</p>
<h3>President Pierce to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; Delayed Ten Days Due to Hurricane Threat in Southeast Asia; To Leave Shanghai to Return to the United States to Await Deployment</h3>
<p>The U.S. President Lines has been quiet for a long time since seven of its postal ships were requisitioned by the government and the schedules of various ships became secret. It is now known that the President Pierce postal ship, which has been requisitioned by the company, came to Shanghai from the United States in the middle of last month and went to Hong Kong and Luzon. It was originally scheduled to return from Luzon on the 4th of this month, passing through Hong Kong to Shanghai and returning to the United States, as reported in previous newspapers. Recently, due to a hurricane in Southeast Asia, the postal ship was affected and the schedule was repeatedly delayed. It is reported that the ship only sailed north from Hong Kong yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 9th) afternoon, stay overnight in Shanghai, and leave Shanghai the next day (the 10th), sailing directly to Honolulu and returning to San Francisco to report to the Shipping Commission and await deployment. As for the exact time of arrival and departure from Shanghai, the company is keeping it a secret and cannot announce it.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Marked the Fourth Anniversary of the Incident; All Sectors Were in High Spirits; Citizens Voluntarily Stopped Entertainment and Banquets; Some Unnecessary Roads Were Blocked</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident. All sectors of Shanghai observed a silent commemoration, voluntarily stopped entertainment and banquets, and observed a vegetarian diet for one day to mourn the soldiers and civilians who died in the war. All entertainment venues and radio stations, as usual, stopped entertainment programs to express their condolences. The citizens of the city, in order to show greater effort and vigilance, sincerely supported the established national policy and sent telegrams to the highest authorities and soldiers to pay their respects. Their emotions were exceptionally high.</p>
<p>Some Roads Were Blocked. In addition to the necessary precautions already taken, the Public Concession Police Department blocked all unnecessary roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch early yesterday morning at 5 a.m. Roads such as the Sanyangjing Bridge area, Gouqiao Bridge, Guangxi Road, Yunnan Road, Longmen Road, Chongqing Road, and Muirhead Road were all blocked. Other roads, such as the Bund, Henan Road, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, Yuqiaqing Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, and Hardoon Road, were all barricaded with barbed wire, with large numbers of detectives stationed to guard and search. Although the French Concession did not block roads, it also dispatched more police officers for security.</p>
<p>The Nanshi Security Was Exceptionally Tight. Starting at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, all five iron gates connecting Nanshi to the Concession, such as Xiejiao Bridge, Nanyang Bridge, Xinjiao Street, Xinkai River, and the 16th Pier, were closed. They were not fully opened until 1 p.m., restoring traffic. Japanese soldiers were stationed at Xiejiao Bridge, Yimiao Temple, and Zhonghua Road. Two small tanks were also placed on Penglai Road. Zhaojiabang Road, from Ximen to Xiaodongmen Hengjie, was closed to traffic, blocking traffic in both directions. Public buses running around the city were also announced to be suspended. Telephone calls between the Chinese Concession were also interrupted for a short time. After the iron gates were opened in the afternoon, everything returned to normal. At around 6 p.m., all the iron gates were closed again.</p>
<h3>Recent Trade Between Shanghai and the United States is Exceptionally Prosperous; Stagnant Business in German Goods Shifts to Ordering from American Factories</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, the source of German goods has become difficult. German pigments, Western medicines, hardware, machinery, etc. are generally being sold at inflated prices by those who hoard them, causing practical customers to dislike the high prices and switch to purchasing American goods. Recently, all lines of business for American merchants have been extremely prosperous. Due to the prosperity of their business, various import and export firms have been sending telegrams to American manufacturers to order various goods. Some British merchant firms have also switched to trading with the United States due to the difficulty of shipping British goods to Shanghai. The development of Shanghai's trade with the United States is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Raises the Price of Foreign Rice by Six Dollars Per Shi; Increased Costs and Increased Shipping Costs; Remaining Funds from Public Granary Continue to be Used for Purchases</h3>
<p>The Public Concession recently issued a notice stating that due to the sharp increase in the cost of foreign rice at its origin and the increase in shipping costs, it has been forced to raise the selling price of foreign rice. The highest retail price will be changed to 116 yuan in national currency per shi (net weight 80 kilograms, or 160 market catties) starting from the 8th of this month.</p>
<p>First Batch of Granary Rice Sold to the Authorities</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Management Committee of the Rice Trade Association yesterday that the first batch of 27,150 bags of the 80,000 bags of granary rice ordered by the association arrived at the port on the "Grant" ship on the 5th of this month and were unloaded and stored in the Roosevelt Warehouse. It is now known that the granary rice has been sold to the Public Concession for £2,240 per ton, at a price of HK$285.13, plus a handling fee of 1.5%, costing 102 yuan in national currency per shi (160 market catties). The Public Granary Committee and the Public Concession have agreed to pay for the goods and deliver them today. The Public Concession will distribute them to various rice shops for sale at a fair price.</p>
<p>Future Shipping Costs are Being Negotiated</p>
<p>The Public Granary Management Committee had previously reached an agreement with Norwegian firm Wah Loon &amp; Co. that all granary rice would be carried by the "Grant" and "Delta" ships managed by the firm. The initial agreement was for a shipping fee of 95 shillings per ton (£2,240). Now, the shipowner is requesting an increase from 95 shillings to 160 shillings. The Public Granary Committee, considering the significant difference from the original figure, has requested permission to reduce it to 120 shillings per ton to reduce costs. The committee will send a letter to the owner of the "Grant" ship within the next few days, requesting compliance with the previously agreed contract or a reasonable reduction, otherwise it will have a significant impact on costs. The shipowner is not insisting on this point.</p>
<p>Public Granary to Continue Purchasing 30,000 Bags</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. yesterday, the eighth committee meeting was held, attended by He Dekui and others, as well as Vigneau, secretary of the French Concession Food Committee, to discuss (1) how to continue purchasing the second phase of granary rice. It was resolved that all of the committee's existing funds should be used to purchase as much as possible, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 bags of rice. However, since two members of the original rice purchasing committee have left Shanghai, Ye Fuxiao, Chen Ziyi, and Zhu Zixiang were appointed to handle the matter with full authority, and it is not necessary to be limited to Rangoon. If the price and transportation of Thai rice are more favorable, it may be purchased from Thailand instead. (2) Regarding the request to extend the contract period for the Daofu Foreign Firm to continue handling granary rice, it was resolved to approve it, and a letter will be sent immediately to request compliance.</p>
<p>Efforts to Mediate the Stevedore Strike</p>
<p>The stevedores in the soybean, rice, and miscellaneous grains industry in Shanghai went on strike on the 3rd of this month due to their unsuccessful demands from the employers to improve their treatment and increase their rice subsidies. According to a reporter from Da Guangshe, since the stevedores in the soybean and miscellaneous grains industry went on strike, more than 20,000 coolies on the docks, warehouses, and stacking yards, responsible for loading, unloading, shipping, barging, and stacking, have stopped working due to the lack of goods to load and unload. However, if the strike in this industry is not resolved soon, it will inevitably affect the livelihood of the above-mentioned workers and lead to unexpected incidents. Therefore, the Concession authorities are now actively seeking mediation.</p>
<p>Letter from the Stevedores</p>
<p>According to a letter from the stevedores, "The news reported yesterday about the strike of the stevedores in the soybean and miscellaneous grains industry, that the employers once asked the labor side to resume work immediately from today and then negotiate in good faith, but the labor side did not agree and is now negotiating day and night, is not entirely true. The stevedores in the soybean and miscellaneous grains industry all know that rice is the staple food of the people and are unwilling to go on strike lightly. Therefore, they first sent a letter to the Rice Trade Association and the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association on June 19, proposing five measures to increase wages and improve treatment. After many days, there was no response. They sent another letter to the two associations on June 23, urging them to respond, but there was still no response. At that time, all the stevedores already had the motivation to go on strike, but after persuasion, it was temporarily calmed down.</p>
<p>Mediation Failed</p>
<p>Then, on June 29, the Political Department of the Public Concession summoned the labor side for questioning, and a responsible representative was sent to attend, bringing five demands for reference. On July 1, the Public Concession notified them again that mediation was scheduled for the morning of the 2nd, but the employer did not attend. It was changed to the afternoon of the same day for mediation, but the employer still did not attend. Since July 3, all the stevedores and helpers have jointly gone on strike in order to promote the employer's awareness. Unexpectedly, the employer reported to the police to arrest the stevedores, accusing them of obstructing freedom. At the same time, it was rumored that the employer believed that the stevedores' strike could stimulate rice prices to rise, and the longer the strike, the greater the profits for the rice shops. Since they have such intentions, there is no request for resuming work first. We are afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world, so we make this statement." According to reports, the Public Concession is currently deliberating on mediation methods. The labor side's demands are indeed too high, but the pressure of life is also a reality. It is understood that the responsible persons on both sides are carefully considering solutions to avoid affecting the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Concentrated Off Wenzhou, Approximately Dozens</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been between 20 and 40 Japanese warships patrolling off the coast of Yongjia. Also, there have been frequent movements of Japanese troops, both old and new, in various parts of western Zhejiang. Japanese soldiers who have completed their service are now concentrated in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade Thrown, Injuring Two</h3>
<p>At approximately 1 a.m. this morning, at 1926 Jing'an Temple Road, a man suddenly threw a hand grenade from outside into the building, causing an explosion on the spot. The shrapnel injured two people. One, Chen Zhensheng (37 years old, local), suffered extremely serious injuries to his waist. The other person's name is unknown. An ambulance summoned by the police took Chen Zhensheng to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. The other man admitted himself to the hospital. It is reported that the grenade thrower escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Participates in the National Foreign Trade Convention; The American Economy Has Entered a State of Preparation for War; Free Trade is Not Permitted by National Policy</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai stated to reporters yesterday that this year's National Foreign Trade Council will hold its annual meeting from October 6th to 8th at the Biltmore Hotel in New York. The Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce will continue to send representatives to attend as usual. It is reported that the items listed on the agenda of this meeting are very important. All issues related to current American foreign trade will be discussed. According to a notice issued by the association, "Since the European market, which accounts for one-third of our country's export trade, has been cut off, our country's trade in important products with the British Empire has been greatly reduced. Therefore, it will be even more difficult for us to maintain this trade in the future than during the First World War. The current stage of the European war has changed the basic position we occupy under the neutrality law. The United States is now fully mobilized to assist Britain and its allies. Because the defense plans of the United States and the Western Hemisphere have transformed our national economy into a state of preparation for war. At this critical moment, our trade with the remaining few markets has also been restricted due to national defense plans. Given these objective circumstances, the agenda of this year's annual meeting must focus on the mutual exchange of opinions, and then foreign trade experts and investors will discuss various wartime trade issues and formulate plans to make recommendations to the government to abandon some unnecessary foreign trade controls. The outcome of this war is very important to us. If they oppose our trade in the future, we cannot make any compromises with other nations in this environment, because their religious, economic, political, and social ideologies are all contrary to our free nation."</p>
<h3>German and Italian Residents in the Dutch East Indies Suddenly Ordered to Evacuate; A Group of 670 People Have Left the Country and Are Coming to Shanghai on the Asama Maru to Transfer to Japan; Rumors Abound that Many Japanese Ships Have Suspended Service on the Pacific Route</h3>
<p>Negotiations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan in Batavia have now stalled. The chief representative, Yoshizawa, has also quietly left and returned to his country via Taipei yesterday. A group of German and Italian women and children, totaling 670 people, suddenly evacuated from the Dutch territory, and the situation has suddenly become tense. This matter is now attracting close attention from diplomatic circles in Britain and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, Japan has not yet announced its attitude towards the war. It is still observing whether it will stay out of the matter or fulfill its obligations.</p>
<p>Asama Maru Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on Wednesday</p>
<p>A group of 670 German and Italian residents in the Dutch East Indies, including 70 German women and children, suddenly received orders from their respective governments to evacuate last Friday. All travel expenses were also subsidized by the German and Italian governments. They have already embarked on their journey to Shanghai on the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru (displacement of 10,017 tons, originally operating on the Pacific route). It is understood that the ship is expected to arrive here this Wednesday, and after staying in Shanghai, it will sail to Kobe. The German and Italian women and children will remain on the original ship to Japan, except for those who have relatives and friends in Shanghai. The reason why Germany and Italy are evacuating their residents in the Dutch East Indies may be a sign that the quiet South Pacific will be stirred up by storms.</p>
<p>The Ship's Route Changed Temporarily</p>
<p>According to news released by the Japanese postal ship company, the Asama Maru was originally scheduled to sail from Singapore Manila to Shanghai last Friday, but suddenly changed its plan temporarily and sailed directly from Manila to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to load 670 residents designated by the German and Italian governments for evacuation to Shanghai. The ship may then dock in its own country and decide to cancel the Manila route, temporarily not accepting passengers and cargo, and the original route will be maintained by the Tatsuta Maru. There are rumors that the Sanukawa Maru and others will also suspend service on the Pacific route.</p>
<p>Australia and the Dutch East Indies Complete Joint Defense</p>
<p>The implementation of joint defense between Australia, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies was announced just three days ago. British Commander-in-Chief in Burma, Lieutenant General MacLeod, broadcast on the evening of the 5th, praising that the aviation bases in Burma and other parts of the Far East are well-equipped and sufficient to resist aggression. Military equipment in Burma, such as modern mechanized tanks, has also been continuously transported in. The tasks in this overall imperial defense plan are being completed one by one. General MacLeod's speech is quite subtle in light of rumors that Japan will launch a southward advance.</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is Fully Prepared Militarily</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies occupies an important page in the current Far East situation and has a pivotal role. If it bows its head to the aggressor, its excellent mineral resources will be seized, which will affect the supplies of civilized countries. However, Lehman, the head of the Dutch East Indies Intelligence Service, and Poden, the Chief of General Staff, have successively expressed their determination to resist. "The people of the Dutch East Indies will fight for the truth, and any sacrifice will not be counted. The signal of freedom will be aroused by a tragic horn. Naval, land, and air force personnel are being mobilized and are intensifying training day and night to complete the arduous task of defense. The Dutch East Indies defense is fully prepared, and if the storm of foreign aggression continues, scorched earth tactics will not be spared."</p>
<h3>100,000 Readers of the Sino-American Daily Console Churchill; A Signed Scroll Over 30 Zhang Long Was Presented to the British Authorities in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Daily in this city received a letter from readers Su Gengshi and two others in February of this year, initiating a joint consolation to Britain. The newspaper believed that this move was of profound significance and belonged to national diplomacy, so it should be promoted. It drafted a telegram and, together with the original letter from Su and others, published it in the newspaper on February 25, and stipulated the signing method. Since the publication of the telegram, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically participated. By the time it was closed in May, more than 100,000 people had participated in the signing, including university professors, primary school students, store managers, office workers, apprentices, and laborers, dancers, covering people from all walks of life. Some wrote vigorously and fluently, while others were straightforward and natural, and their innocence was delightful. Some even stamped with red seals, making the colors more vivid and dazzling. After the newspaper collected all the signed papers, it paid for them to be mounted. Eight mounting workers worked hard for ten days to complete the task. It is said that since taking on the mounting work, there has never been anything as grand as this. The entire scroll is more than 30 zhang long and 30 inches high. The beginning of the scroll is the full text of the consolation to Prime Minister Churchill, written in regular script, followed by the list of signatures. The newspaper specially invited British dignitaries in Shanghai to present the scroll yesterday. Those who attended included Kohler, Chairman of the British Residents Association, Woodhead, Chairman of the China Association, Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Middleton, Chairman of the Joint Military Service Association, Francis, Chairman of the Royal Air Force Association, Sir Noble, the person in charge of the British Embassy in Shanghai, Lester, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Embassy, ​​Madley and others. First, the newspaper's authorities made a speech, expressing their gratitude to the British aid to China movement. Then, Kohler, Chairman of the British Residents Association, gave a reply, expressing his deep admiration for Generalissimo Chiang's leadership of China's war effort, and remotely wishing Generalissimo Chiang good health. The two sides talked and laughed happily. This national diplomatic work of great significance will undoubtedly promote the friendship between China and Britain.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Tang Continues to Hope for Donations; Still Short More Than 60,000 Yuan This Year</h3>
<p>The Nanshi New Pu Yu Tang, which is run by the Catholic Charity Association as a welfare institution for poor children, has achieved remarkable results. Since this newspaper introduced it to readers, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, with large donations or gifts of goods, giving a ray of hope to the precarious economic situation of the church and turning it from a situation of insecurity to stability.</p>
<p>An Anonymous Philanthropist</p>
<p>One day, when the sun was scorching hot and unbearably stuffy, a gentleman came to the hall in a hurry, stating his intention to donate 1,250 yuan to the New Pu Yu Tang. When asked for his name, he smiled and did not answer, but said that doing good is not for reward, so please write "anonymous". At that time, he was asked to pay the donation at the nearby Huamei Pharmacy collection point. Such a warm-hearted person who does good anonymously is truly commendable.</p>
<p>What the Orphanage Needs</p>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang almost came to a standstill due to lack of funds. Now, it has finally overcome the difficulties, but it has not reached a point of complete and permanent relief. Therefore, donations are still urgent. In addition to donations, goods are also very necessary, such as rice, oil, salt, cloth, medicine, etc. Readers, if you give your surplus to the needy orphans, this must be something you are willing to do.</p>
<p>Children Care for Children</p>
<p>Among the many donors, there are also many donations from children, such as several students from the Sino-French School, several children from the Louis Elementary School, etc. They saved the candy money their parents gave them and donated it to the poor orphans. This is truly a manifestation of a pure childlike heart. Although the donations are small, their enthusiasm is extremely commendable.

<h3>Joyous Come Apartment Shooting Case: Witness Complaint Details, Wang Zhending Opens Fire, Wounds Hu Songyue, Both Hospitalized, Further Investigation After Recovery</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, at 5:10 PM, a shooting incident occurred in Room 293 of the Joyous Come Apartment in the Run Come New Village on Jing'an Temple Road. Hu Songyue and Wang Zhending were injured at the time and taken to Shilong Hospital for treatment. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Judge Shi of the Special First Court in the Second Criminal Tribunal. The victim was Hu Songyue, and the defendant was Wang Zhending. Since both parties were injured and receiving treatment in the hospital, they were unable to attend court. The details of the hearing are recorded below:</p>
<p>Both Suffer Gunshot Wounds According to the Detective Attorney Zhang Tianyin, the victim, Hu Songyue, is 26 years old, from Wuxi, and runs the Haochang Iron Factory at 579 Wuding Road. He suffered injuries to his chest and both arms. The defendant, Wang Zhending, is 37 years old, from Zhejiang, and resides at 49 Shou'an Lane on Mintini Yin Road in the French Concession. He previously held a position in a certain organization. He is currently receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to his right leg at Baolong Hospital and was unable to attend court today.</p>
<p>Loan Dispute It was found that Hu and Wang were acquainted, and both possessed licensed firearms donated to the Public Works Department. In March of this year, Wang borrowed 2,115 yuan from Hu. Afterwards, Wang gave Hu a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for 600 yuan, payable on June 10th, which Hu transferred to his friend Yao Wenjie. When the check matured, Yao presented it to the bank, but it was returned due to insufficient funds. Yao then hired attorney Chen Qingfeng to send a letter to Wang Zhending, demanding that the check be cleared by July 8th.</p>
<p>Angered into a Rage After receiving the letter, Wang was deeply dissatisfied and went to Room 393 of the Joyous Come Apartment in the Run Come New Village on Jing'an Temple Road on the afternoon of the 5th of this month to negotiate with Hu Songyue. He took out a pistol and accused Hu of inappropriate behavior. Hu immediately stated that it was Yao's personal action and that he was unaware of it. At that time, the defendant put the gun down, but unexpectedly, the gun suddenly went off, hitting his own right leg. However, the defendant, not knowing it was an accidental discharge, mistakenly believed that Hu had opened fire, and in a fit of rage, raised his gun again and fired two shots at Hu, one hitting Hu's chest and the other hitting his arm. Hu fell to the ground, injured.</p>
<p>Investigating the Bullets The defendant, believing that Hu also had a handgun, then went forward and took Hu's handgun, firing a shot into the sky outside the window. Afterwards, he sat in the room until the police heard the alarm and sent detectives to arrest the defendant. Two handguns were seized on the table. Hu's handgun contained six bullets, and the defendant's handgun contained five bullets. It appeared that a total of three bullets had been fired, so it is still necessary to investigate exactly how many shots were fired. A request was made for a postponement, and the witnesses Yang Kesen, Gu Haicheng, and Yao Wenjie all filed complaints. The court ordered the case to be postponed until the defendant recovers from his injuries for further review.</p>

<h3>Grain: Public Works Department Rice Continues to Arrive, Rice Prices Rise Across the Board by About Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice saw another price increase. Although some hoarders released stock at noon and a new transaction was about to be agreed upon, resulting in a slight drop, the closing price was still about two yuan higher than on Saturday. At the opening of the market this morning, due to the continuous shrinkage of exchange rates and the gradual increase in production costs, people were already optimistic. Furthermore, unpredictable international changes encouraged speculators to buy, coupled with the fact that orders had not been completed for the past two weeks, providing further justification for hoarders to raise prices. Therefore, prices gradually increased after opening. Yinghua Company's Xiaojiao rice reached 154 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice for July arrival reached 147 yuan, Sui rice futures 118 yuan, spot 115 yuan, all up about three yuan. Subsequently, a new transaction was initially negotiated by Dahu but not finalized, and later agreed upon by Shenji Foreign Company, involving a ship of Xiaojiao rice to be shipped at the end of July, priced at 151 or 156 yuan in Shanghai currency, pending confirmation today. Once the transaction was confirmed, market sentiment calmed down, and the price dropped by one or two yuan as profit-taking long positions were released and hoarders observed. As a result, the closing price was still one or two yuan higher than last weekend. Total transactions for spot rice were over 30,000 bags, and Yinghua Company's transactions were over 220 tons. However, the majority was bought by hoarders, with actual sales to local customers accounting for only 20-30%.</p>
<p>Public Works Department foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived at the port at noon the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 10,000 bags of Public Works Department's low-priced foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, also carrying 15,106 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, also Public Works Department rice, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is heard that a large shipment of Siamese rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the next few days. (Zu)</p>
<p>For thick and thin Japonica domestic rice, the supply of fresh Nangang early and late rice is still scarce, and local shops favor it, leading to strong sales and frequent shortages. Prices continue to rise by about two yuan. The quality of the rice is relatively muddy, with high-quality rice priced at 143-144 yuan and medium-quality rice at 141-140 yuan. As for Wuxi original-packaged overnight Japonica rice, although the supply is also limited, sales are weaker, making it difficult to compete with early rice, resulting in a slight price increase of one yuan. High-quality rice is priced from 132-133 yuan to 129 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice is also scarce. In addition, prices of other grains are rising across the board, boosting market sentiment. Both retail and wholesale markets are quite active. Prices of both domestic and foreign glutinous rice have increased by about one yuan. Hong Kong high-grade white glutinous rice is priced at 144-145 yuan, ordinary grade at 142-143 yuan, medium-grade at 141 yuan. High-grade glutinous lvs is priced from 115 yuan to 109 yuan.

<h3>Sugarcane and Sugar (2) - Foreign Section -</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>This shows that he fundamentally did not understand the method of sugarcane sugar production: because although there is a kind of white powder growing on the stems and leaves of sugarcane, it is definitely not the raw material for making sugar. In 98 AD, the Roman natural scientist Pliny the Younger also recorded that during the reign of the notorious tyrant Nero, doctors used the name "Indian salt" to refer to cane sugar: this substance "resembles ordinary table salt in shape and color, but has the taste of honey." If this record truly came from the hand of Pliny the Younger and was not a forgery, then the production and popularity of "white salt sugar" already existed in the first century AD! Unfortunately, no definite corroborating evidence can be found for this, and most scholars are unwilling to believe it, thinking that this statement is a bit premature.</p>
<p>To say that cane sugar truly spread to the eastern Mediterranean and that Europeans gained a clear and accurate concept of it, can only be traced back to 627 AD when Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire first launched his eastern expedition against Persia: at that time, the cane sugar seized as war booty was regarded as part of the Persian king's treasury. How did the Persians learn to make cane sugar? Probably before 500 AD, they had already planted sugarcane near the city of Gondisapur at the mouth of the Euphrates River. There was a Catholic monastery in this area, and the monks were deeply knowledgeable in medicine and had frequent interactions with Indian doctors. They learned the secret of sugar-making from Indian doctors and refined and improved it, thus first creating truly pure white and solid cane sugar, which they named "Tabergad," meaning "that which is split with an axe." This is the true origin of "white granulated sugar" and "rock sugar." Moreover, what we now call "rock sugar" is called Kand in Persian, which is very similar to the royal title Kani or Khan, what is called "Khan" in our historical records. I presumptuously speculate that only the king could initially enjoy it, so it got the name Kand.</p>
<p>The practice of cultivating sugarcane spread extremely rapidly in Persia, so by the mid-seventh century AD, when the powerful Arabs rose from the desert and conquered the region, the rapid sugar production industry was already flourishing. The Arabs immediately imposed taxes on sugarcane fields and sugar factories; sometimes, these taxes were collected in kind, that is, in the form of manufactured sugar, to be used for the royal palace's daily consumption or celebrations. The Arabs also widely spread sugarcane to all the places their forces reached, first affecting Egypt: probably around 750 AD, the fertile and rich Nile Delta was covered with sugarcane fields. Sugar-making technology also made significant progress, because for many centuries, many scholars had been immersed in chemical research there: for example, the method of using lime or plant ash to purify sugarcane juice began at this time; some also believe that the manufacture of rock sugar also originated in Egypt. The consumption of cane sugar increased even more dramatically. According to a book by Lippemann: "The amount of sugar consumed for a royal wedding or other celebration could reach as high as 61,000 kilograms or even 76,000 kilograms in today's quantities"! Sugarcane also spread with the Arabs' invincible military power, multiplying in Morocco in 710 AD, and from there, it crossed the sea to settle in Spain, and it immediately flourished due to the suitable climate and soil in these places. Several Arabic books that appeared at this time described the planting of sugarcane and sugar-making methods in great detail and accurately; moreover, stone mills used to crush sugarcane at that time still remain in the three cities of Valencia, Alicante, and Malaga along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. The Arabs also introduced sugarcane to areas in the eastern Mediterranean such as Palestine, Syria, Sicily, and Cyprus in the mid-eighth century. The above-mentioned places were famous sugar-producing centers in the Middle Ages, especially the sugar produced in Egypt, which was of superior and solid quality and could last for a long time, so it occupied an extremely important position in commodities.

<h3>Academic Lectures: The Method of Historical Research (3)</h3>
<p>— Xue Wujing</p>
<p>(1) The Application of Tools History is rooted in geography, just as the soul is attached to the body. Without a body, there is no soul; without geography, how can there be history? The so-called tools refer to geography and maps. The scope of geography is extremely broad, including terrain, oceans, mountains, rivers, soil, minerals, and climate. The great stage of human activity is, of course, on the earth, and no one is unaffected and restricted by geography. For example, China is located in the temperate zone, so it is one of the world's cradles of civilization. The development of culture originated in rivers. The activities of the early people were in the Yellow River basin, gradually moving south, expanding to the Yangtze River basin, and then advancing to the Xijiang River basin, the Heilongjiang River basin, bounded by the sea in the southeast, blocked by high mountains in the northwest, separated by deserts in the north, and bordered by the tropics in the south. Thus, this vast country, occupying one-fifth of the world's population and one-fourteenth of its territory, although naturally blessed, has natural limitations in its development on all sides. Furthermore, plains are suitable for agriculture, and the people of the south lack a strong spirit; plateaus are suitable for nomadic life, and the people of the north have a more magnificent style. Therefore, when it comes to culture, the south is higher than the north; when it comes to military achievements, the north is stronger than the south. The partial peace of the Eastern Jin Dynasty and the southward crossing of Gaozong, the impermanence of unity and the occasional division and combination, none of these were unaffected by the limitations of the north and south of the region. By the time maritime transport flourished and science progressed, distances of thousands of miles were shortened, and there was a method for shrinking the land. Therefore, this old ancient country, even if it wanted to close itself off from the world and never interact with people, could not do so. Other climates, the quality of the soil, and the distribution of production are all closely related to the masters of history. Therefore, those who read ancient history should at least skim through Gu Zuyu's Reading History Fangyu Jiyao, Gu Tinglin's Tianxia Junguo Libi Book, as well as the Records of Rivers and Canals, the Water Classic Commentary, the Geographical Explanation, and the Geographical Rhyme Bias, etc., so as not to have the disease of swallowing dates whole and having a vague impact on the historical background. What is decided by geography is nothing more than a map. If the map is unclear, then the division and combination of the territory, the changes in hills and valleys, the division of political regions, and the strategic importance of passes in various dynasties will inevitably cause dizziness and confusion. If many historical materials are piled up in the chest and the causes and consequences cannot be clarified, what is the benefit? The earliest map-making in China can be attributed to Pei Xiu of the Jin Dynasty, who made the Yu Gong Regional Map. Jia Dan of the Tang Dynasty made the Hai Nei Huayi Map, using one inch to represent one hundred miles, which was the beginning of drawing maps with a scale. The Ancient and Modern Counties and Roads of the Four Barbarians described the ancient counties in ink and the current prefectures and counties in red, which was also the beginning of the distinction between red and black in later illustrated books. Later, in the early Qing Dynasty, Westerners Du Dewei and others were ordered to survey and map the maps of various provinces and vassal states, naming it the Huangyu Quanlan Map, which was the beginning of China having actual measured maps. Yang Shoujing's Historical Territorial Evolution Map of Dynasties, written during the Qianlong period, presents the history of past and present in a way that shows its evolution. It is a great undertaking in our academic circles. In recent times, Su Jiarong has also created the Chinese Geographical Evolution Map, examining the similarities and differences and analyzing subtle points, which is unmatched by the works of recent scholars and can serve as a ladder for scholars of history. These are all essential readings for our historical research.</p>

<h3>Entertainment Mania</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>Reading the statistics of the money Shanghai people spend on luxury goods and entertainment venues every month, the huge numbers are always staggering. Luxury obsession and entertainment mania can be said to be a special phenomenon in Shanghai after the war.</p>
<p>However, when we examine the situation in European and American countries during the First World War, the situation was almost no exception. After the European War, people of all ages in Europe and the United States mostly became entertainment maniacs in their spare time because they were oppressed by the war in terms of their emotions. Dance halls, casinos, and taverns, all places of entertainment, were three times as profitable. Social morality declined. Probably what is called "people's hearts are not as ancient as before, and social customs are declining" is exactly this time.</p>
<p>According to psychologists, this large-scale phenomenon of seeking pleasure is not accidental. After humans are spiritually oppressed, they will naturally find an emotional outlet for themselves. People with deeper cultivation will feel the importance of their own responsibilities because of the occurrence of war, and therefore stand more firmly in their positions. Their response to war is constructive. As for people with shallow cultivation, their response is naive and escapist. In order to temporarily forget the spiritual oppression they have suffered, they embark on the path of excessive indulgence in seeking pleasure.</p>
<p>We do not deny the benefits and needs of appropriate and noble entertainment, but what we are willing to point out here in particular is: entertainment is a shallow and escapist reaction to war in humans. To eliminate this naive phenomenon, personal cultivation is an important key.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Floating Palace</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>In this time of widespread war and precarious world situation, President Roosevelt's only pastime outside of official duties is to take a trip on the yacht "Potomac," temporarily forgetting the disputes of the world and enjoying a moment of quiet pleasure.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt originally had two places for rest, Warm Springs and Hyde Park, but there, he was constantly disturbed by telephone calls, not as leisurely and free as on the water. In his childhood, the president liked to sail and boat, and he has not given up this old hobby even after becoming president. Every summer and autumn, he would always take a boat trip, fishing and looking for fun along the way.</p>
<p>Each time the president travels, he often brings a group of advisors and close friends. The recent cruises along the coast of Florida were like this. However, the friends he brought each time were different. Each trip lasted from one to three days, traveling down the Potomac River into Chesapeake Bay, with the aim of fishing, resting, and enjoying the coolness. The topics of conversation were half official and half social. Amidst the leisure, a little official business was handled. The president likes to strategize outside the office, and he often finalizes major plans during his travels.</p>
<p>The "Potomac" is the president's floating palace, converted from a coast guard cutter. The ship was originally named "Electra," and it was renamed after Roosevelt took office in March 1936. The entire ship is painted gray, and its appearance is not very luxurious, but the president loves it very much. The boat is 165 feet long, less than 24 feet wide, and has a displacement of 450 tons. It is powered by a diesel engine and has a speed of 14 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the rear part of the middle deck of the yacht is the most unique. It is covered with a large pile of thick cushions, with several tables and armchairs. This area is called the "fantail" in naval terminology, and it is suitable for dining, playing games, reading, and resting. The president spends most of his time on the water here.</p>
<p>In front of the fantail are the dining room and the president's bedroom. The interiors of both rooms are very simple. The bedroom only has a bed, a table, and a few chairs. The middle of the deck is the living quarters for the officers and soldiers on the boat, as well as the president's kitchen. The front is the captain's private room.</p>
<p>On the top deck, there are three open-air areas for deep-sea fishing and sunbathing. From the middle floor to the top floor, there are handrails and an artificial elevator installed in the large chimney at the stern. On the top deck, there are often a 18-foot-long whaling boat and a 26-foot-long motorized whaling boat. These boats are sometimes lowered into the water for fishing.</p>
<p>On the bottom deck, directly below the dining room and the president's bedroom, there are two bedrooms and two small rooms for five or six of the president's guests to rest. The front of the deck is the engine room and the sailors' bedroom. Generally speaking, the equipment of this yacht is similar to that of other yachts. However, the "Potomac" is equipped with two .50-caliber anti-aircraft machine guns, as well as equipment to defend against magnetic mines. There are fifty sailors on board.</p>
<p>When Roosevelt travels by boat, the Navy Department sends at least one destroyer to escort him. The official business he handles in his floating palace is no different from that in the White House in Washington. Government departments such as the State Department and the White House transmit important news to the president.</p>
<p>This news is first telegraphed to the Naval Radio Station, which then relays it to the yacht. The yacht also uses this method to relay messages to Washington. If Washington has important documents and mail that need to be reviewed or signed by the president, the Navy sends an airplane to the president's cruising location.</p>
<p>The president's floating palace is not only a place for handling state affairs, but also has historical value. In the days of the old President Roosevelt, the Russo-Japanese Portsmouth Peace Conference was in a state of impasse. Old Roosevelt invited representatives from both Japan and Russia to his yacht "Mayflower" to persuade them to understand each other, and succeeded. As for the "Potomac," although its history is short, it has already created a lot of history. Before the outbreak of the European War, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England visited the United States and traveled on the yacht from Washington to Mount Vernon. In addition, the president has held talks with dignitaries from various countries on the yacht.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever international tensions are high, we hear that the President of the United States is boating and fishing, and we feel that he is too leisurely, but we do not know that the president does not forget state affairs while fishing!</p>
<p>Inventions</p>
<h3>New Glass</h3>
<p>— Jie Quan</p>
<p>The invention of glass is undoubtedly a major contribution to modern civilization, but usually glass is only used to make windows and utensils, and has few other uses. The reason is that glass is easily broken, not easily bent, and not as convenient and durable as wooden objects.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the glass industry has obviously made great progress, and various novel glasses have been invented and successfully made. Many of the cloth or wooden items that were previously available have been replaced by glass.</p>
<p>There is currently a kind of fabric on the market that is bright and dazzling, as shiny as silk, fire-resistant, and water-resistant. This strange fabric is woven from thin, flexible glass fibers. Since the United States began mass production of this glass fiber in 1939, countries have competed to imitate it. It is expected that in the near future, the textile industry in various countries around the world will undergo major innovations.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that safety glass is made of two layers of ordinary glass, with a layer of transparent plastic sandwiched in between. This transparent plastic can hold the inner and outer layers of glass together, preventing them from shattering. During the European war, stores in cities around the world used this principle to manufacture unbreakable glass, so as to reduce damage to doors and windows during air raids. The method of making it is to sandwich a layer of fine lead wire mesh or transparent fiber sheet in the glass. Another method is to stick a sparse, leaky curtain on ordinary glass, and then glue the curtain firmly to the glass with paint or glue. In this way, even if the glass windows are inevitably shattered by the shock of an air raid, they will not scatter and injure nearby people.</p>
<p>Elastic glass is another extremely important chemical invention. This glass has all the advantages of ordinary glass, but without its disadvantages. Elastic glass is transparent and bright, can be bent, and no liquid can penetrate it. It is odorless, tasteless, and not easily worn or broken. It can also be made into various beautiful colored glasses, and some people are already using it to make belts, suspenders, carrying cases, handbags, and other things. And because gold letters and inks can also be hot-stamped on this kind of glass, it can also be used to bind books.</p>

<p>So, Begonia had to give up the plan to move. It didn't matter if the land was not planted, or even if it was abandoned, but where would the food for the family of three come from? Buy it with money? There were too many places to spend money, and the money he had was too little!</p>
<p>He leaned his body against a wooden pillar under the porch, his face facing the sky, and unconsciously became lost in thought.</p>
<p>Later, the bell for the end of class woke him up.</p>
<p>"Dad, it's raining so hard, and you still have to come yourself. Look, your body is all wet!" Meibao opened her two slender arms, swooped over like a swallow skimming the water, hugged Begonia's waist, and said with a spoiled and coquettish look: "If it's like this again next time, I won't go back with you!"</p>
<p>Avoid the suffering of dampness and fever in summer</p>
<p>Begonia just smiled slightly and didn't say anything. He took her hand and hurriedly walked to the end of the corridor. He was always very afraid to meet Meibao's teachers and classmates. As long as he could avoid it, he would never want to meet them.</p>
<p>When he reached the end of the corridor, he squatted down, wanting to carry Meibao on his back.</p>
<p>"That's not good, Dad!" Meibao insisted on refusing.</p>
<p>Begonia stood up very awkwardly, turned his head, and looked at his daughter with an inquiring gaze. (152)</p>

<h3>Telescopes on Glasses</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>To help certain visually impaired patients read books and newspapers, American eyewear manufacturers have recently invented a small telescope that can be mounted on ordinary glasses to help with reading. This is because there are some patients whose vision is too weak, even the most powerful magnifying glasses cannot enable them to read books and newspapers. This small telescope is exquisitely manufactured, and its structure is the same as the world's largest 100-inch telescope at the Wilson Mountain Observatory. This is truly good news for the visually impaired.</p>

<h3>Novel Election</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>Strange and interesting things happen endlessly in Hollywood. Recently, a group of American naval personnel held a novel and interesting problem test, soliciting answers. Their question was: "If you were stranded on a desert island, who would you want to be with?" As a result, Lana Turner received the most votes. Lana is the former wife of Artie Shaw, a bandleader famous for his clarinet, who is now divorced. She has married singer Tony Martin, the former husband of Alice Faye. After they collaborated on "Ziegfeld Girl," their love matured, and they recently announced at the Movieland building in Hollywood that their wedding date was set for September 10 of this year, to be held in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Lana Turner is the "hot girl" idol most admired by college students. Under the nickname "Sweater Girl," she certainly has moving characteristics in terms of physical beauty. Her bold, bare-chested and bare-armed clothing is the most eye-catching in Hollywood, not only on the screen, but also in public places. Therefore, her seductive and bold style is even more captivating than "Oops Girl" Ann Sheridan.</p>
<p>The naval personnel who voted for her generally believed that if they were stranded on a desert island with her, they would not feel bored or disappointed even if they never returned to the civilized world.</p>
<h3>Ying Yin to Perform in a Stage Play</h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>Since Ying Yin returned to Shanghai, her works have rarely been seen by the audience. Perhaps this is due to prudence. Of course, "Sai Jinhua" and "Return of the Soul" have considerable achievements, so everyone's expectations for this artist are also particularly high.</p>
<p>It is rumored that "Children of the World," which has been rumored for a long time, will meet the audience in the cool autumn. This play stars Ying Yin and Sima Yingcai, and the story tells the love and success story of two orphans. Ying Yin plays an orphan who is fostered in a carpenter's house. She undergoes various hardships from a young age and is even forced to work as a dancer, but she is able to work hard and achieve success. The Minhua Company has specially invited the German couple Frelke to direct, which shows how serious they are.</p>
<p>In fact, before "Children of the World" is staged, Ying Yin can have an opportunity to show her true face to the audience, which is to perform "Grievances in the Qing Palace" at Tianfeng. "Grievances in the Qing Palace" is a quite great drama, and news about it has been seen in various newspapers. It is currently being rushed into production by Fei Mu, and it is said that the technique is extremely novel.</p>
<p>Ying Yin plays the role of Consort Zhen in "Grievances in the Qing Palace." Some people believe that "Grievances in the Qing Palace" should be based entirely on the historical facts of Empress Dowager Cixi, because according to folk legends, Cixi is considered even greater than Wu Zetian. In fact, according to accurate research, Cixi did not have many achievements worth mentioning. According to the political situation of the year, Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen were actually the main characters. Consort Zhen was a beautiful and wise woman who, with full of justice and passion, wanted to revitalize the country, but was eventually oppressed by evil forces and died by throwing herself into a well. Yao Ke wrote the play with Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen as the main characters, so Ying Yin took on the role.</p>
<p>It is reported that this play can be performed around the 17th, which is Ying Yin's first shot on stage after returning to Shanghai. It is expected that countless audiences are looking forward to it!</p>
<h3>Zhang Yipeng Rehearses the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>"Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" is a great historical drama. In the past, Huayi Film Company filmed a film, and the "Hong Yijiao" performed by Zhonglu shortly afterwards also adopted a story from this. Recently, reporters learned that Gengxin Stage is also planning to rehearse this play.</p>
<p>Gengxin's performance of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" has been brewing a strong atmosphere for a long time. It was previously rumored that Zhang Yipeng was going to write the script himself, and now we can reveal this mysterious curtain.</p>
<p>The content of the script is determined to adopt three outlines: (1) Zhang Yipeng himself drafted it. (2) Refer to the "Red Sheep Heroes" of the Gongwu Stage. (3) The materials collected by He Haisheng. — Combining these three points will become the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" that will be performed soon.</p>
<p>The plot of the first play starts with Lin Zexu being impeached and ends with the uprising in Jintian Village. The romance between Hong Yijiao and Xiao Chaogui is also interspersed in it. Zhang Yipeng plays Wei Changhui, Liu Wenkui plays Hong Xiuquan, and the work is very heavy. On the martial arts side, Liang Xichao, Wang Fuying, etc. will participate, and the opening scene of the Baoliang attacking bandits will be absolutely firm.</p>
<p>These days, Zhang Yipeng is sweating profusely, supervising all the staff and stepping up the rush to rehearse. It can be performed around this Sunday or next Sunday. They only perform on Sundays, and only during the day.</p>
<p>I really like the story of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and I hope that this performance can give us a sense of justice stimulation, rather than being boring and poor.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on "Wusheng" on Various Stages in Shanghai (4)</h3>
<p>— Jing Chun</p>
<p>Wang Xiaofang: Wang Xiaofang, a wusheng at the Grand Theater, is currently in his prime. He has been performing with Lin Shusen for many years and is a figure in Lin's bag. He is also good at many plays. His martial arts are strong and extraordinary. Although he is short in stature, his appearance is extremely dignified. He can play roles such as Zhou Yu and Lu Bu, which is still quite considerable. The plays with costumes such as "Changban Slope," "Jizhou City," and "Yuehu City" are his forte. He is also capable in short-hit plays, and his falls and tumbles all show skill. Therefore, stage owner Lin Shusen relies on him very much. However, recently he went to play Jia Ming in "Legend of the Gods and Swordsmen," and his jokes and laughter were very funny and commendable.</p>
<p>Zhao Songqiao: Speaking of Zhao Songqiao, he has been in the Liyuan circle for a long time. He has been hanging his sign at the Gongwu Stage for a long time. He is capable in both civil and military plays, and he is also one of the great mixers. He is very willing to work hard in the plays he performs. Every move and every action is full of energy, which is unmatched by other wusheng, so he has also won praise from the general audience. Since he went to the Tianchan Theater, Chen Hefeng's full notice was dismissed, and he took the lead alone; however, the box office appeal of the play "Huang Tianba" was slightly reduced, so he hired the Beijing-style actor Song Shiluo to perform on stage, ranking below Song. Regarding Zhao's wusheng plays, he is good at costumes. In the past, his performances were vivid and worth watching. Now, there is no purely orthodox wusheng play that can satisfy the audience. He specializes in winning with his performance style.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiongpa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: What Can Ning Wu Do?</p>
<p>They attacked the city again in the afternoon, and Zhou Yuji taught them to fire the cannons again. For three consecutive days, they beat the rebel soldiers so hard that they cried out in pain. The total loss was 10,000 people. Li Zicheng said angrily: "Zhou Yuji is so hateful! If I don't break Ningwu, I swear I won't live!" Niu Jinxing suggested: "Although Zhou Yuji is brave and good at defending, if we attack continuously, and he has no external reinforcements, he will be broken by me sooner or later. It is better to divide our troops into ten teams and take turns attacking. When they fire the cannons, we will stop attacking. After the cannons stop, we will continue to attack, so that there is no time for the city to breathe, and we can take advantage of the opportunity to attack." Li Zicheng praised Niu Jinxing's suggestion, so he divided his troops into ten teams. Infantry and cavalry were combined, with about a thousand people in each team, building various colored flags to identify them, and attacking day and night. Unfortunately, the cannons on the pass were unharmed, but the gunpowder was exhausted, and they could only be fired sparingly. Seeing that the sound of the cannons on the city was sparse, the rebels boldly crowded up. Zhou Yuji then gathered archers and crossbowmen to shoot. One team of rebel soldiers came and one team went, taking turns attacking. The first team used a red flag, led by the rebel general One Tiger, and attacked the most fiercely. The second team used a green flag, led by the rebel general Full Sky Star, with the most bows and arrows. They specialized in shooting rockets. The third team used a yellow flag, led by the rebel general Zai Jinhu, with the most siege ladders. The fourth team used a black flag, mostly cavalry, led by the rebel general Shoot Down the Sky. The remaining fifth team used a purple flag, the sixth team used white, the seventh team used blue, the eighth team used light red, the ninth team used ochre, and the tenth team used gray. They were colorful, dazzling and strange, making the officers and soldiers on the pass overwhelmed. For another five days in a row, the officers and soldiers were indeed exhausted. Niu Jinxing also taught the rebel soldiers to tie persuasive letters to the arrows and shoot them to the city wall. The officers and soldiers picked them up and gave them to Zhou Yuji to read. Zhou Yuji was afraid that the morale of the soldiers would be shaken, so he summoned the generals and persuaded them: "We killed 10,000 rebels in the first three days. Although we lack ammunition now, we can still fight for a long time. If we can win, the entire army will be loyal and righteous, otherwise, it is better to tie me up and offer me to the rebels." All the generals wept and obeyed, vowing to defend the city to the death. (109)</p>
