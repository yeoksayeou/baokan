<h3>中國問題難獲解決　美日談話陷於停頓　傳日已放棄成立協定希望　東報促日閣對蘇進行談判</h3>
<p>路透社三十一日華盛頓電</p>
<p>美日關係之繼續緊張、現尚未達於極度、今仍可謂為處於停頓狀態中、日政府似不抱對美成立任何大規模妥洽之多大希望、但此問亦未見東京於美日談話失敗時準備有何行動之表徵、談話固不中斷、但其進行之速度則如蝸步、紐約時報引華盛頓日方發言人之言論、據謂、日政府幾已放棄　於太平洋問題　美成立完全的協定之希望、因美政府堅持太平洋問題之仟何永遠解決、必須涉及日軍之退出中國也云、此間觀察家之與遠東事件有密切接觸者、久已料定必有此重要條文、故數星期前許多方面所盛稱美、日兩政府行將成立範圍廣大的協定之說、不值一嗮、紐約時報又引該日方發言人所發「此問談話時、雙方會有若干提議與答案、但相差太遠、不能鼓起早日解決之希望」等語、是該發言人已證實此間美人覜察家　星期來所已共知之事態矣、紐的時報謂華盛頓今日一般意見皆以為未有總解決之機會、而油禁令之解除、亦渺無希望、國務院或準備設法使荷印之油運往日本、以換取日本不在南太平洋或西伯利亞續作侵略行動之担保、惟此種方案、亦未必有成功之可能云、</p>
<p>今後危險局勢　發動仍在日方</p>
<p>事有在今日似已成公開秘密者、美國初料束條就相職後、衝突殆不能免、故當時此間曾盛傳東條　相、美國乃論其軍隊備戰之謠言、惟現知今日情形並不若是、此間人士咸認東條行動持重、其所以然者、殖有兩事、一為希特勒之未能攻陷莫斯科或粉碎蘇聯抗戰力、一為進兵西伯利亞勢必使日木對英國甚至亦對美國作公開之衝突、第據此開所獲情報、日本仍作各種初步行動、如已調兵一百二十帥準備發動及陸續運送配備與供應品是、不過在莫斯科未失時、不致有新舉動耳、日本擬對美妥洽及設法維持貿易原狀之企圖、殊不進步、日方已覺華盛頓不拋棄許多基本要點、自東條秉政後、美國務副卿威爾斯僅與日代表集議一决、觀此美·日談話進行之速度可以推知、據報紙紀載、此問日人承認雖日代表已聲明、在十一月十五日日本議會集會以後、或將發生危險局勢、但美·日談話終未見多大進步也、日方所謂危險局勢者究在何方、日人未曾說明之、而日本已向美政府提出哀的美敦書、限美·日談話在十一月十五日以前必須有進步之宣傳、乃由此而起、其實感覺局勢愈臻困難者為日本、而非美國、禁令現使日本受重大打擊、因此理由、今後行動仍在日本、此間若干人士預料、日本議會苟非完全緘默、則東條將遇說明美·日關係何以陷於此種危險狀態中、以及渠目前有何措施與今後意欲何為之困難時日矣、</p>
<p>傳日閣已同意　先進功緬甸路</p>
<p>合衆社三十一日倫敦電　昨日此間獲得向被視為可靠方面之情報稱、日本於未冒險南侵前、準備對中國作強力之攻擊、該情報稱、日本內閣已同意先攻緬甸路、然後作進攻重慶之計劃、俾盡力結束中、日戰事、此間對此消息難未證實、但彼等對於日本在滿洲之軍隊、堅信已增至三十五師或四十師、</p>
<p>合衆社三十一日重慶電　中國陸軍機關報本日稱、日軍增加集中軍隊於山西、河南及越南北部、以備同時自南北兩面向重慶作巨大之鉗形進攻、並截斷滇緬公路、該報籲請英·美立即對日本採取行動、因欲擊破希特勒先必解決日本也、該報稱、英國撤僑命令之唯一目的、乃欲以軍事解決日本、中國正在對東亞新秩序及所謂共榮圈者作戰、吾人希望英·美除明瞭此點外、並立即向同一方面採取軍事行動、</p>
<p>合衆社三十一日東京電　日木廣知時報今日於社評中斥責美國向中國要求轉讓根據地、作為美國租借按華之報償、而重慶已在原則上加以接受之舉、該社評稱、此種轉讓抵押包括美國於世界和平建立以後、或作為世界和平之條件、在中國維持及利用叫未明之海軍根據地之廣泛權利（該社評顯係根據最近華盛頓之消息、謂美國已要求英國保證美國利用全世界英屬根據地之權利、與美國同時向中國及英國提出戰後之經濟重新建設程序）、該報謂、美國赴華軍事代表團團長馬格魯特少將、耍求蔣介石將軍接受此項協定、該社評稱、日本拒絕正在對此國及遠東作更大威　之萬惡控制計策、現已可見援助中國之租軍案、凡在擴張富裕之美國也、該報在另一社評中稱、美國和平可由寬容、讓步以表明更積極之弱點」、俾盡力推行世界之和平、又稱、日本為僅有不參戰之國家、力能在世界之每一處、在最有利情形下援引美國發動之和平政策、美國從未表示有努力和平之準備、允其在太平洋上、唯任何建設性之建議、不能被認為示弱、美國必須明瞭此意、現猶為時未晚云、</p>
<p>合衆社三十一日東京電　國民新聞促請東條勿失機會、與蘇聯談判未解決問題、俾以公　、正直態度運用中立法、該報稱、蘇聯應中止對中國援助、又稱、蘇聯目前已將失其京城、太平洋之戰雲日益增加、日本與蘇聯之關係、目前更不能冉飄浮不定云、</p>

<p>路透社三十一日威靈頓電　紐西蘭勞工大臣威勃、頃在沃克蘭海軍根據地向工人發表演說、謂最近德國之促使日本加入軸心對澳攻擊、或亦將施於紐西蘭、渠信日本當知攻擊澳洲及紐西蘭將非易事、並對日本之將留意於德國勸誘表示懷疑、謂倘使日本竟予以留意、則紐西蘭之每一國民、皆將各盡其實云、</p>

<p>路透社三十一日倫敦電　今晨各報均以大宇登載昨日東條演說、及滬、所傳英大使館發出通知警吿英人早日乘機撒退之消息、「新聞紀事報」社論云、遠東危機之氣壓表雖上落無定、但就全部而論、其趨向殊見惡化、該報結論謂、日本之軍事及經濟各問題已如此嚴重、其唯一解脫之希望、厥在軸心之勝利、故日本不久或將突向前進、亦未可知、「每日雷聞報」亦著論云、東條飲以堅決的宜　嚇　美國及英國聯邦、雖巳甚明、惟彼決不能脅誘美國與之妥協、俾使其稱覇遠東、亦可斷言云、「孟卻斯德指導報」外交訪員云、東條亟欲鞏固國內陣綫、以應付米來惰事、惟同時日本各領袖希望其神經戰爭將可幫助達到其目的、並使美國實行讓步、殊為明顯、就情形推測、日本似在華府談話中曾力圖勸誘美國放棄援華、但美方之堅決態度、已再二在此項談判中有明白表示、據日政府所採取之手段而觀、可表明日本在經濟政治及軍事意義上已逐漸臻於準備之狀態、現時尚無立即攻蘇之現象、惟有不少事實可證日本將準備於蘇聯萬一有崩潰現象時、自後加以襲擊、該報末稱、日本與葡萄牙訂的以蒂摩爾為航空綫起訖地點事、可認為係主張海戰者暫時在東京稍佔優勢之徵象云、</p>

<h3>無使必需品成為屯積品</h3>
<p>有貨斯有財，不必操縱，不必屯積，而自增值；是財之來，若出於天授，非關人力，此工商界及屯戶中人之得意語也。溯自物價不斷暴漲以來，十餘倍數十倍乃至百餘倍不等，中以五金西藥建築材料煤米麵粉紗花洋雜貨為最，暴發一二千萬之新富，求諸今之社會中不為少見，而曰非國難財，其誰信之，不有國難，安得至此。戰神者惡神也，於一般生活受嚴重威脅，言之痛心。戰神者財神也，於一般發國難財者對之，欣然自得。</p>
<p>藥以治人，叵奈有藥不肯以應病者之求，求之而又故昂其值，竟有不及醫治而死；紗布米麵多屯積，豈止人有飢寒色，亦將有凍餒死；存煤居奇靳售，燃料乃見非常之恐慌；五金十百倍其值，非徒工業品成本暴騰，亦且使日用器皿昂貴非凡。洋雜貨之漲風混亂，謂之上漲無正市，亦無不可；如是安得不民生憔悴，屯貨狂盛。</p>
<p>然而返顧大衆生活，元氣隨物價之日高而日漓；蓄積隨屯積之日盛而日薄。百業皆以發財稱，，但門市生意受購買力之拘束，日見其顯；夜市營業之提早收東，日見其多，通常之所謂賺頭，皆從貨物買賣所可獲得貨幣多寡為言，其在貨物未出售前，賺之為賺，財之為財，猶在未定之天。今日之法幣，非故作誅心之論，竟有人以為將蹈馬克盧布之覆轍，此其不明當時德俄與今之中國情勢有異。果欲使法幣發生空前之大變，何必有目前種種舉措，此可知對法幣懷疑者為不當。且就近事以為觀察，法幣南運，為數尤鉅；資金內移，旣有獎勵，復有保障；顯見上海通貨有收縮之跡象。再觀平準會之通吿，『就上海所存之大量必需品而言，以前規定之外匯供給，頗為寬厚，乃近來投機活動與普遍屯積，致物價在漲，深可痛恨。但平準會無論如何，擬增加對中國非淪陷區域蝓人區域之便利，而規定運入該區域必需品之外匯。』觀乎此，則滬上人士對於必需品之外匯，不必過作杞憂；但求所可獲得之物品，不為投機屯積施展操縱之魔術所玩弄，落於其魔掌中耳！</p>
<p>今兩租界當局已致力於此，前日工部局總裁在招待記者席上關於調整租界內物價之一番言論，其大旨頗能就已往管理之寬弛，加以控制，循此而行，不落通套，則於物價之平準，生活之安定，必大有助力。要知政府仍供給上海必需品以外匯，無非顧全中西人民之福利；夫以漏巵言，固以杜塞為上策。亦為顧全友邦商人之營業，不然，儘有若干非為生活上所必不可缺者，而亦予以匯上之接濟。惟是欲望無窮，財源有限，上海中外人士若無戰時刻苦節的之精神，只圖目前之享用，依然將中國財源，儘量揮霍，消耗於不必要之物品，行見噬臍之悔，或有不容倖免之日。</p>
<p>再所謂必需品者，本無一定之界說，隨生活程度之高低而異其目光。譬如汽油，以之用於警備車救火車救護車，及其他緊急事務，有不得不需汽車代步者，固為必需品；然若用之為出入代步，兜風行樂，非以一般生活為準則，是為圖享用，非可謂之必需矣。允其以一般生活所必需者為必需品，非可只顧某一階段某一種人之便利為必需。更不可使供給外匯之原料，成為製品之後，頻漲其價，如烟草之與紙烟是也。又不可如煤之為業中人及屯戶操縱，用棧單相買賣，而使眞正消費，出高價相求，，甚至有求之不得之嘆。亦無為業中人所吸收壟斷，有如英美藥品，來源未嘗中斷，而仍有求之不得，得之不易，是豈供給藥品以匯，嘉惠病人之本意哉！今租界當局既為界內市民謀福利，圖生存，無使必需品成為屯積品，而有欣然得意於有貨斯有財，是固大衆所引領以望者也。</p>
<p>抑平物價之先決條件</p>
<p>旬日以來，上海市塲，各種投機買賣，價格蜚騰，有如在癎，影響所及，日用物品，無不奇昂；使喘息僅存之小民，益陷水深火熱之中，難於掙扎，貽害民生，將胡底止。</p>
<p>平常物價之漲落，或因成本，或因供求，或因幣值，要有錢索可循，其漲落之程度，亦有一定界限。今則不然，旬日之間，黃金市塲，價高逾倍，每條竟至二萬元以上，其非完全由於成本供求幣值之關係，顯然可見。普通物品，又惟黃金之馬首是瞻，金價漲而百物隨之俱漲，於是投機者益趨多頭之途，擁資者競作囤積之計。結果各項物品，因囤積愈多，流通愈少，而價格愈高，愈利於做多頭及囤積者，循環不已，遂使物價逐步增高，漫無止境。一言蔽之，無莫非黃金作祟，為階之厲也。</p>
<p>欲蘇民生，必平物價；而釜底抽薪，允必自壓平金價始。蓋黃金國有，早有明文，而當局對於平民生計，復極關切，則非法買賣黃金，任意抬高價值，使百物胥受刺激，價格日增，重困吾民，實背當局愛民之意。矧就現在市况觀之，多頭方面，雖若獲利倍蓰，不難面團團作富家翁，孰知震盪市塲，俶擾生計，長此以往，必至若決江河，無法挽救。一旦商業停滯，人心惶亂，社會阢隍不安，皮之不存，毛將焉傅，斯亦不能不望投機家之有以自省者也。</p>
<p>抑銀行辦理押款，本以便利商業，調劑金融，而現在之投機家，率以所圃貨物，向銀行押取現款，旋復以此押款，繼續購貨囤積，幾經蛻化，直可使囤貨總值，超過原有資本數倍以上，是藉調劑商界金融之資，轉作摧殘平民生計之具，為害之烈，何可勝言。各銀行為救濟市面，以策自身安全計，允宜在此期間，對於貨物押款，一律停辦，已押者並卽催贖，如是，則投機家之實力大减，囤積之風，必將遠遜於前。且共已囤之貨，必有多數因償還押款之故，而丞思脫手者。囤貨一經流通，物價自然低落，維持民生，此尤急務，不禁跂予望之矣。</p>

<h3>談中國的平民</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠</p>
<p>亞洲雜誌最近出版的中國專號。名作家如斯諾，烏特麗女士，賽珍珠女士，及林語堂博士等均著文頌讚此次中國作戰之卓絕千古，必獲勝利。賽珍珠女士以名小說家而論中國平民，觀點牽涉人生哲學，刻晰精遼，意在言外。茲擇原文可發表者節譯於下。編者</p>
<p>有一天我站在南京的街角，南京在其時是革命中國的首都。有一個靑年人芷在向一堆興趣集中，靜聽着的眾衆演講，題材是他貢獻給羣衆的一種生活方式，可以得到莫大利益。時代是一個變動的時代，數月前，一次重要的革命正在南京城中發生。老官僚被逼出亡，不多一會，像演講者一般的年靑人熱心奔走，獲得政權。我那時還看不大慣革命的中國，聽了這種演講頗表厭惡。舊的中國已否過去，我先前所知道的一切現在都已消失了嗎？這一羣傾聽的羣衆不知在想什麼？</p>
<p>到最後，那長髮靑年散發一種淡紅色的票子。除我以外，每一人都拿到一張。他不來派給我，却向我凝視了一會，於是並不加以警吿，把唾沫吐在我面上。十幾條手仲出來給我手巾，手帕揩拭。人聲嘈雜，是熱忱的咀咒。「混蛋！」「下賤坯！」一老婦人牽我衣袖，引到一家老火灶。「到裏面來吧－我老太婆熱水總有的，還有一塊肥皂。」我用肥皂和熱水洗爭面孔，謝謝她的好意。我正想跑出去，忽然瞥見地板上的一張淡紅色紙條。這是她的票子，我拾了起來。</p>
<p>「隨帶此　革命軍所設第一工廠，你　可謀得職業。」紅紙條上這樣說。我知道她不識字，就高聲講給她聽。</p>
<p>「這是紙條上的意思嗎？她問我，語省中含有十分藐視的神氣。</p>
<p>「正是呀，」我說：「你得好好收藏起來－那是恨有希望的。」</p>
<p>她笑了。「這許多年輕小伙子！」她安適地講。「誰去相信他們？」</p>
<p>「何以不信？」我說。「人們近來相信許多事情呢。」</p>
<p>她把手搖搖。「是的，不過不是這些！有誰聽見人們肯並不為了什麼而工作？到廠裏去工作，我又不是他的親眷，也不會托他找過事情。不，不會有這種人的。我們等着瞧吧。」她把紙條撕散；把碎片擲掉。</p>
<p>我一路向街上走去。在泥淖中，濕的圓石子上，看見黏住不少紙條。每一人很愉快地依了自己的方式生活。他們以好奇的心理聽那靑年的說教，但從未聽到過這種奇怪道理。他們一手接受了他所給予的希望，一手就把希望拋開。在中國，沒有人信仟可懷疑的事物。</p>
<p>在現在這些時日。每當中國人民一再傾聽人家所給與的希望時，我常要記起這故事。他們將走那一條路？走他們自已的路，我知道。其他路綫都是不可能的。世界不但在國族與國族之間有法西斯與民主政治的劃分，而且在個人與個人之間也有這種分野，中國平民在現時並沒有這趣區分。在分裂甚　的國家，社會與家庭中，敵人就可以特殊和可怕的方式走進自己的家中。自有歷史以來，現在尚存在於地球上的民族中，要算中國人民的性格最民主化了。中華民族一脈根傳？已有四千年於茲。常令人引起不適當的懷疑。他們像一方紀念碎，體積龐大，我們給它遮得一無所見。如其這裹僅是一個雕像，一所廟宇，或一座宮殿，年代悠久，到現在仍　實可用，這是一種奇事，人人都要轟動。但是這裏是一個國家，今日世界上最大的國家，土地廣漢，人口佔全世界的六分之一，國內有許多情形還保住中世紀的狀態，按着自已的速率發展國是，並不與世界進化同一步驟，雖然橫受科學家琿精竭慮所造成的新式軍械的侵害，仍繼續生存，而且除了土地廣大以外，一無顯著勝人的資源，但日增強韌，勝過開戰時不少。這是中國。中國有更重要的意義者，因為有廣大的人民和土地。</p>
<p>人們說到「國家」一詞，總包含有比土地和人民更多的東西。凡海口，空軍，實業，自然資源，進出口貨物，軍力等等都要包括在內。但中國只有人民和土地。海口現在已經喪失了，而且亦不多。空軍極少，中國人不能擴展一强固空軍。從現代的眼光看來，實業方面發展，亦不遠大，從前存在於少數城市中的大企業現在已經消滅。自然資源除農業以外他們素來疏忽。和各國貿易，因早已預知將引起麻煩，所以不大起勁。武功是數百年來一向輕視，深信上流人士不會以兵戎相見。</p>
<p>一種較不適合於現代世界的觀點幾乎不能想像。軍備充實的日本在攻擊中國時，有許多人雖然承認過去中國曾在征服中充份發揮過堅持力量，但對於今日的國力極為懷疑，因為科學已完成了各種殺人利器。就普通常識看來，中國的應戰完全沒有準備過。國內軍隊有未經訓練的，飛機極少，重砲完全缺乏，沒有現代戰爭經騐，希望任何方式勝利，缺少實際理由。但大家都知道中國人民要求戰爭。他們應戰並非保衛土地，他們還計劃作戰略撤退，損失大量土地；並不是一保衛若干城市，有若干城市是一自動放棄，或付之一炬；甚至一並非保衛自已生命，生命已不顧危難，犧牲於日人的軍火之下。中國人民作戰，為了要保衛他們自願怎樣生活的權利，耍成為一個自由的不能征服的民族。城市可以重建，失地可以克復，因為基本的土地保留，這是不可更動而且不能毀滅的。中國人民不願受人支配，他們不是能在屈服下生存的民族。</p>
<p>這許多中國人是怎樣的人？他們大部份是平民。中國人口中極少數是上層階級，百分之八十五是農人，他們住在小村中，靠田地為生。其餘的百分之十五中有百分之十是屬於小商人階級。還剩百分之五方包括鉅富，智識階級，和統治階級。</p>
<p>因此這種平民就是中國。他們明白表示了自己的要求，於是國家講話。所以他們要求對日應戰，戰爭就此開始，雖然政府領袖深知防禦軍械非常窳敗。但是政府領袖亦知道最好的防禦就是一般民衆的精神</p>
<p>其他國家內部發生腐敗，這種民意就值得考慮。中國却是一個不會顚覆的國家。中國旣不願白白送給侵略者，亦不肯交與自已的緩和派。（未完）</p>

<h3>李德爾等即將赴港　通盤籌劃供匯事　採取空前行動抑平物價　市塲混亂狀况卽將轉捩</h3>
<p>平　會以嶄新姿態供應必需品外匯</p>
<p>昨晨消息、工部局總董李　爾、與美董明思德、將於星期日離滬去港、與平準會商榷、俾獲取更多之外匯、供本市商人採購必需物品、此乃工部局為抑平物價而將採取之空前步驟、聞李德爾與明思德、將以關於本市進口商對外滙需要之詳細報告書、遞交平癡人說夢會、其與該會商榷之目的、為使雙方對有關上海之各種外滙事宜、獲得更密切之合作、為求達此目的　、兩氏將以申述此間現狀之詳細報告書遞交平準會、本市方面、可望不久即見大受其惠、</p>
<p>滙額增加情勢好轉</p>
<p>平準會於　日披露今後將對上海除奢侈品外之各種進口品、給予更廣大之外匯便利、此乃本市貿易物價與匯兌情勢均將好轉之徵兆、昨日路透社香港電傳、平準會於十一月份撥給上海輸人食物與煤所用之外滙、將予增多一節、實予本市商界以平凖會已修改其政策之確證、此間有資格人士且謂、平準會所取新的自由立塲、猶有遠過於此者、煤商與銀行方面、在表面上皆以未接可證實路透雷之消息為言、但非正式談話時、皆　可望「立刻」接獲證實消息、此種發展之影響所及、市民生活之各方面、殆均將蒙受其利、</p>
<p>緊張現狀將趨寬弛</p>
<p>試舉煤為例、趙南煤價近告飛漲、每週每噸約漲百元、且傳某大煤業進口行刻正考慮若不獲平準會外滙、即告停業、而市政當局亦無法保持煤價之穩定、茲者、本市煤商不日定可獲得平準會之外匯、故煤斤問題、將大轉寬弛、如運費等因素亦能解決、則本市煤價、可望回跌至正常水準、其他各種物品、莫不如此、據本市金融界人士解釋稱、平準會給予更自由之外匯便利、非因政策改變、但因其組織已完全告竣之故、在理論上、認為必要的堵塞外匯　隙之限制辦法、因乃不復需要、　平準會於過去三週來、逐日集會、對於上海之困難、加以相當之注意、</p>
<p>先生管理米　麥煤</p>
<p>工部局權威人士昨又聲稱、總董李德爾及美董明思德兩氏此次準備赴港、乃為長時期研究商討之結果、蓋在兩氏決定赴港以前、對於何種物品需要較多之外匯、傳已有原則上之確定、又據消息　通人士透露、工部局實施管理物價計劃中、首富其衝之物品、厥為生米·　麥·及煤斤三種、　米雖已統制、但為求繼續不斷之輸入、以安定價格、在外滙供給上自須先獲得肯定之保障關於　麥及煤斤、雖已由工部局　平準會接洽、尚無具體之結果、故李明兩氏之在港、將親向平準當局說明原委、他如調味品·除污物料·藥品·烟菸·肥皂及顏料等、工部局雖亦決定統制其價格、但其重要性顯不及米　煤等遠甚、七部局並盼市民在此期間靜候消息、切忽輕信謠言、致予市儈以濫抬物價之機會、</p>
<p>影片給滙已有眉目</p>
<p>本市各電影院、因西片分銷商不獲外滙、致被迫停業之危險、殆已消失、蓋聞平準會將以影片從「奢侈品」類改列入「必需品」項下也、據消息靈通人士稱、上海西片商聯合會代表海格氏赴港與平準會談話後、已返上海、可使本市不致失却主要娛樂品之影片、負責方面且傳平準會「業已撥給」輸入影片之外滙、聞海格赴港陳述一切後、平準會委員認為影片應改列入「必需品」項下、但請海格提出書面報告、說明應撥給外滙之理由、海格從之、平準會委員刻正研究此報告書、尚未正式簽覆海格、因美專家與華方代表、皆在重慶故也、記者頃以此事叩諸西片商聯合會主席羅巴都、羅氏以「頗可樂觀」答之、</p>
<p>培克洋行開始登記</p>
<p>工部局總辦費利溥、於前日在招待記者席上、發表談話時、曾聲述將組織一進口商與製造家之協會、並委託公共租界外灘十七號英商培克洋行辦理登記後、大中社記者特於昨日下午、向該洋行探　一切、據稱、該洋行雖尚未獲有當局所發給之各項登記章程、但該洋行　理培克氏、已通知該公司辦事員、於昨日起、辦理本埠各進口商及製造商登記事宜、按該洋行前名和明商會、成立於西歷一八四七年、至一九一六年改稱培克洋行、迄今已有九十五年之歷史、其營業範圍甚為廣泛、除辦理各種貨物之進出口外、並担任各進口商及製造廠之聯絡事務、故與本市各業頗有密切關係、此次接受當局之委託、辦理進口商製造商協會登記事宜、當可勝任愉快、聞一俟該項登記事宜辦理完竣、將由當局召集會議、商討進一步制止投機漁利、及抑平物價之步驟、</p>
<h3>營業特捐將開徵　調查估價</h3>
<p>公共租界工商局定明年元旦起開徵營業塲所特捐、並經聘定估價調查人員、以便從事進行、茲以距離實行之期已邇、故該局決於今日起、派遣調查人員、分赴中西北東各區從事里弄調查、以期明曉房屋是否住宅或　業處所、一待調查完畢、即將交由估價人員從事估價、以便如期實行徵收特捐、</p>

<p>工部局頃發布告略稱、本局為確使上海民衆在不能向零售米店購得本局洋米時、可照局定價格、直接向本局購買起見、決定在蘇州河南北兩區中心地段、暫設售米處各一所、凡個人或商號、願在本局監督之下、以代理人資格在各該售米處辦理出售事宜者、可以書面向本局總辦處申請辦理、惟申請人務須具有在滬零售食米之經騐、熟悉其中情形、並能供備相當職員、藉使代理事宜能妥善進行、呈送申請書時、必須檢附證明文件、並說明其他重要群情、申請書務必於十一月五日以前送到、過期送到者、不予考量、</p>
<h3>郵資今起加價　香港澳門電報費亦增加</h3>

<h3>英方再令撤僑　警戒性質</h3>
<p>英大使館情報參贊前日　申前令、郭促僑民撤退、此事在若干人民羣中、似引起相當之注視、惟據新聲社記者由英官方探悉、此次再令撤僑、仍以婦孺及不必要留居之男子為限、至其他僑民、則不因一時局　之緊張而撤退、查目前旅滬英僑、猶達四千餘名、其中五分之一為婦女、自去秋美國宣佈撤僑以來、英官方亦曾勸告僑民撤退、但其效極微、此次重申前令、無非為警戒之計、而不能視為英國放棄上海之商業地位及其他、目前英僑撤退、其去路有五、為馬來亞·印度·緬甸·澳洲及新西蘭等、</p>
<h3>各加油棧今起　日耀停供</h3>
<p>據悉、本市若干主要火油公司、為减少銷售量、俾現存汽油、可維持較長時期起見、自今日起、每逢星期日、將停閉若干加油站、本市德士古火油公司、昨日宣稱、自十一月一日起、每逢星期日、全部加油站停止供給汽油、惟添加潤滑油之服務、並不停止、另一油公司將採取同樣辦法、其設於界外之加油站、每逢休假日期、停止供給汽油、關於十一月份之派油證、已由各火油公司分送各主顧、並勸告各主顧遵守派油證上之用油量、因除特殊情形外、不再考慮增加供給量、</p>

<h3>上海的娼妓（中）</h3>
<p>— 可羣譯</p>
<p>在此種價廉之妓院中，每一娼女每夜的須供二十五位顧客之取樂。外國人去光顧者雖力持某種程度之衛生，但事實上據醫師吿予謂，至少有三分之一顧客，因不事前預防致染有此種惡疾。</p>
<p>予於該種妓院之娼女中，探知若輩大部份皆係來自鄕間，彼輩對於其現在之命運，亦並不感小滿意，實緣彼輩在城市中較農村中易於生活也。細析之，其間大多數之女子係為其貧苦之父母，將其出售而墮入平康者：有許多則係押入妓院者，—在妓院操淫業若干年；少數則為歹人自鄕村中拐帶來滬而賣入者。</p>
<p>在上海有一種罪惡之職業存在着，此即為以年靑女子為交易之職業，此輩有許多買賣掮客散佈於鄕村中，他們專務價買。質押。甚或拐帶女子之工作：，另一方面，並為娼奴買賣之交易，如她們「質」的方面有損壞時，—如已染有惡疾或色衰者等，則常為彼輩由一妓院而出售於另一妓院。但，此不僅上海然也，即其他許多國家中，至今亦仍有該種職業之存在。此種罪惡與疾病之存在於上海，我們不能譴責他們—旣非該項以人為買賣之職業，也非娼妓，更非巡警，此乃上海本身需要妓女之存在，而此輩女子亦並不感不快，記得予會逛一妓院，聞人發問：「英美之巨輸因何尚不到上海來了！」斯何故？</p>
<p>公共租界中僅十數家之高等妓院係依例受醫師之檢查，餘則無之。娼妓之在公共租界中是非法的，但决種娼妓仍遍佈於各處。在法租界，則認許娼妓必須　往登記。法租界中之妓女咸須遵從定章而受醫藥檢查，惟此非謂所有法租界中娼妓皆係淸潔而無疾病者，相反的，據一位醫師吿記者謂：性病之存在於法租界，適與公共租界中之同樣普遍。</p>
<p>法租界中之妓女，於其染有疾病時，則當局者能予以少數之醫藥注射，但她并非受醫治，蓋她們於受醫治時，須停止數週或數月之工作，此則彼等所不能者。醫藥注射僅係除去外表疾病之狀態而已，至其內在之病狀，固無異也，因之其傳播疾病之於大衆，無論其受有醫藥注射與吾，仍無二致也。因娼妓們雖染有疾病，而鴇兒們仍不允其暫停工作：設若對法租界中之娼妓皆予實際上之治療，則此項醫藥費用必鉅大可觀，何况此種疾病尚繼績源源由公共租界而流入法租界呢！</p>
<p>記者所觀察之低賤妓院中，共間之女子，予從未見有其注意現代之衛生方法者，數女子且已染上吸毒嗜好矣。惟大多數之娼妓從未接觸麻醉藥物，直至她們在此中度過數年後始染上者也。她們之吸毒嗜好太深者，將為逐出妓院，流落街頭，或冉價售於更下等之妓院。娼妓之在妓院中工作數年者，則必完全染有疾病，雖間或有少數之醫藥注射，但仍不能改其外表之病態，此時，彼等之命運為非遭逐出，即為遣送回鄕，若她是遭逐出者，必將開始在街頭賣淫，致散佈其所染之疾病於都市中之下層階級人們之身上；如她係被遣送還鄕者，則將嫁為人婦，其所染之疾病，將遺傳於將來所生之子女身上。</p>

<h3>南洋的華僑兒童</h3>
<p>— 吳緘三</p>
<p>在南洋羣島的華僑兒童，據我調查所得：總數共有九十萬人之譜。中以泰國最多，計有三十二萬；英屬馬來半島决之，計有二萬。餘則荷屬東印度的為十八萬，法屬安南的為七萬：美屬菲律濱最少，僅有五萬而已。</p>
<p>這班生長於海外的小一峇峇」和小「娘惹」們，因南洋氣候四季常春之故，所以他們大都發育得很快；一到了十四五歲，就已是一條魁梧的身軀，一副闊大的胸脯，儼然是一個個的彪形大漢了。他們那種健康的體魄，誰瞧了也得喝一聲采，逈非在國內生長的兒童們所可比擬。</p>
<p>我們的華僑兒童們，就像一個個的小天使一樣：他們大都生得很慧點，很活潑可愛。但赤道那　熱的氣侯，影響了他們腦子的發達，如果年齡比較大些，思考力和記憶力就漸漸地遲鈍下去，人也就漸漸地變得愚唉起來了。因此之故，他們最不適宜於學習那需要謹嚴縝密的科學；僅是一條「479×368＝？」的淺易的數學試題，一個十一二歲的華僑小學生，常常也就得挨了教師好幾頓的籘條。他們的天性比較喜歡藝術，膂樂，運動之類的玩意兒，長大了往往很有造就。此外，因為一向住在異域，他們對於外國文字如英文，法文，荷蘭文，馬來文等，也很擅長：中國文則雖唸個十年八年，也還是如對一尊丈二和尚：摸不着頭腦。這是環境使然。</p>
<p>他們一到了五穴歲，就大都給送進華僑小學裏去。他們的家道大都很殷實，至少也是不愁衣食的小康之家，他們有吃，有玩，又有書唸，他們是幸福的！但他們那種烏烟瘴氣的家庭環境，卻是他們最犬的不幸：他們的家長大都是沒有智識的工商階級，腦筋很腐舊；因此教養孩子們，比比還是沿用着古老的方法，荒謬失當，自不待言。我說：應該放開那道窄鬥，讓他們到另一個新天地裏去才是！</p>
<p>設起他們的個性：恰就有如小猴猻樣，他們大都好動惡靜。他們可以終日在外頭跑跑跳跳，譬如打球兒啦，游泳啦，爬山啦……，但卻不願在椅子上捱它三兩個鐘頭，讀完它一木薄薄的童話集。他們的心地大都很率直，又很富於情感：如果你對他們講一點中國被侵略的史事，便會引起他們揑緊小拳頭，義形於色：如果他們的一位教師要離開他們了，便會賺得他們無數天眞的眼淚，如別骨肉。</p>
<p>最後，我得大書特書的，就是：這班華僑兒童們的愛國心很活躍。據我所知，在南洋各地，每逢放學之人後，他們便三五成羣地，背起一面募捐的鐵錢筒，跑個五里十里，冒着當空的酷熱的太陽，為苦難的祖國乞振。歷年來南洋華僑對於祖國那一大筆的捐輸，至少有四份之一強，是他們用那小小的喉嚨，用那一臉的汗珠，用那熱烈的愛國心所換來的。可愛的小天使們呵！</p>

<h3>羅斯福總統的八大顧問</h3>
<p>— 義道</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福手下有八大顧問，每晚與總統會晤，商酌策略，報吿各界消息並識拔推薦有為之才，所以羅斯福總統倚之如左右手。下面是這八個顧問的素描：</p>
<p>（一）麥蘭脫—現任政府情報處處長，具有堅強的決斷力，故深為羅斯福信任。麥蘭脫前會任霍華德的戰地訪員及編輯多年，所以對新聞界底細，瞭若指掌。當任編輯時，會撰文竭力抨擊新聞須受檢查統制的政策。白仟情報處處長以來，幾乎每順赴白宮與羅斯福總統會唔。</p>
<p>（二）肖武—肖武為一著名編劇家，會著有「林肯傳」，「地老天荒」等劇本，均光後由好萊塢搬入銀幕。肖武身長而細瘦，然其工作之熱忱及毅力卻超過常人，往往連夜為羅斯福總統草擬演辭，不至完畢，不稍懈弛。</p>
<p>（三）伯力脫—伯力脫貌美而有魄力，前任美國駐法大使，此决大戰爆發時，伯力脫幾乎終日在橫渡大西洋的長途電話中與羅斯福會談。</p>
<p>（四）羅純孟—現任紐的最高法庭庭長。當羅斯福預備發表爐邊談話的時候，也就是他最忙的時候。羅純孟具有一種不可思議的特才，能於演辭中穿揷詼諧和精闢的短句，為全篇演說生色不少。羅純孟曾為羅斯福編撰政府文件五巨開，所以可稱為羅斯福總統的私人編輯。</p>
<p>（五）奧康諾—以前羅斯福執行律師職務時，奧康諾為福斯福的助理律師。他的弟弟在一九三八年大選時因羅斯福得勝而宣告落選，但是奧康諾與羅斯福的友誼卻並不因此冷淡，現任國家小兒麻痹症研究院院長。</p>
<p>（六）弗蘭克夫特—據說由弗蘭克夫特所推薦的官員，比羅斯福總統親目識拔的還要多。其人博學多才，　異是羅斯福的活動百科全書。</p>
<p>（七）克利許—現任衆議院圖書館館長。其對各國歷史的熟諳，頗得羅斯福的歡心。</p>
<p>（八）伯路起—伯路起每星期二赴白宮與羅斯福共進午餐，餐後必將國防程序作一精密的報告。伯路起會任一九一七至一九一八年間之戰事實業部長，所以對戰時之生產，具有豐富的經騐。</p>
<h3>實價的人生</h3>
<p>— 非了</p>
<p>些日子，報紙上刊着一大幅「中國生化生藥廠」的良言，中間有這么一段：</p>
<p>「我們是制造，不是改造：求物美，不求價廉」。</p>
<p>我不禁點上幾個首，因為這是一個正面的人生學！</p>
<p>多人想，人生是改造的，利用的，把玫瑰加艷了，把蘋果放大了。</p>
<p>許多人也想，人生是取巧的，節約的，把高山繞了把小邱登了。</p>
<p>這是百分之百的錯誤！正面的人生，是製造的，發明的。正面的人生，是規則的，價值的。科學家會吿訴您：</p>
<p>「多少時候，我想利用某一種學識，倡說，得到一條捷徑，但結果，什么是叫我多兜上幾個圈子的，我領會：發明是靠自己去發掘的！」</p>
<p>有經騐的商人告訴您。「我可以經營一家「老店」我也可以經營一家新店，只是經營不了「老店新開」」。</p>
<p>「是的，絲襪人减價了」但當心兩個星期就會漏跟允共，一個長着白鬍子的教授要吿訴您：</p>
<p>「如果您要學習法文，最好把英文忘了，因為每一種的文字，都有牠的獨立性的」。</p>
<p>您要是跑到禮拜堂去，牧師先生也會吿訴您：</p>
<p>「基督不是修理世界，乃是給世界一個拆毀一個建立」</p>
<p>我們已經夠看見，我們是製造麫包的，不是切烤土司的，什麼都得從出發點做起。</p>
<p>「人生是一個謎，一個夢」，那是詩人無聊之作！把自己小看了，是證明自己的「物不美」：需要眞價實貨的人生！沒有决貨！沒有折扣！</p>
<h3>汽油制橡皮</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>最近美國方面有人發明直接用汽油製人造橡皮的法子，這誠使美國獲益不淺，蓋她可不造依賴外國供給這種重要的原料了。這類新發明的人造橡皮樣子很是奇特有趣。現在已有人用它來製造車胎或其他東西了。因原料和性質的不同，美國尚有好幾種其他的人造橡皮。所以國防專家可隨心如意地選擇性質最合適的橡皮來製要製的東西。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四打英雄的生活</p>
<p>姓錢的聽了他這一大篇很古怪的理論，一時倒也想小出什麼話再好駁倒他。</p>
<p>正在這時候，蕭吉淸已笑嘻嘻的走回來了</p>
<p>「吳老板，木來咱們這兒是絕對沒有辦法的；因為，錢兄，你也知道，」他一而說，一面不住的用眼光在錢吳兩個人的臉上盤旋着。「自從閘北一開火，市面就糟得不得了，上海四家大戲館，不到兩個月，倒關了三家，此刻就剩咱們這兒還在勉強敷衍着。可是因為這樣，前後台的人便多得了不得，別處停下來的人，都上這兒來我路子。現在這些話也不用提咧！旣然是錢先生的面子，祇要吳老板不嫌委曲，那末現在有兩個機會，就憑你自己挑吧！」</p>
<p>機會一來就有兩個，倒眞是秋海棠所沒有想到的，連錢若默也笑得險些把半截雪茄打他自己的嘴角邊掉下去。</p>
<p>「那末請問是那一行呢？」秋海棠低聲下氣的問。（二五一）</p>

<h3>檢定測騐並誌所感</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>雙十節發表的「趣味測騐，」承讀者踴躍參加，應徵函件宛如雪片飛來，限期五天之中，共收七、五三四件，可謂五光十色，琳瑯滿目，而有美不勝收之概。我們從二十日起開始檢閱，請同人四位幫同開卷，並首先作應徵人職業的統計，結果爲商三六％，學二四％，工一二，其他二八％。當時決定甄別分作初選，複選，精選三個步驟，而由我任閱卷之責。</p>
<p>初選分任甲乙二類，着重第一題，以所答初映期天數相近者入選，計得一、六七二人，落選者爲五、八六二人，平均的合五分之一弱。複選分爲甲，乙，丙，丁，四類，第一二兩題並重，即中外兩片初映期天數全對，而十六對夫婦排正者列甲等；初映天數半對，而夫婦排正者列乙等；天數稍差而夫婦排正者列丙等；天數與夫婦排列均稍差者列丁等。因此甲等得八十叫人，乙等得九十五人，而限額只一百人，丙丁等又作廢，將甲乙等一七九人中，再行精選的手續。旣稱精選，當然要格外愼重，仍分析爲甲，乙，丙，丁，四等，從一七九人中選出一百人，作爲定局。所定標準如下：（一）兩題全對，繕寫工　，依照格式剪貼者列甲等，共計十人；（二）兩題全對，依照格式剪貼，而繕寫欠工者列乙等，共廿人；（三）兩題稍差而繕寫工緻者列丙等，共三十人；（四）其他列丁等者四十人。總數恰爲一百人。綜觀七千餘應徵文卷，我覺得有幾點普遍的弊端，不無遺憾！例如繕寫潦草　糢糊，剪貼或大或小，不依規定的格式，因此參差錯落，盈尺文卷，失其美觀，最後把錄取的一百卷，修剪整齊，裝訂成帙，纔成個樣子。這是一般人最易忽略的地方，亦是一切事不上軌道的起點，古人說：「不依規矩，不能成方圓。」我爲矯正懇習，於此不免稍作求全的責備，贖者諸君，也許會原諒我吧。</p>
<p>此外中國聯合影業公司及人華大戲院當局，都復信來證明「木蘭從軍」與「亂世佳人」初映的起迄日期，使我有所準繩，十分感激。其决以名額有限，對大多數落選諸君，並致歉忱！</p>

<h3>The China Problem Difficult to Resolve; US-Japan Talks Stalled; Rumor Japan Has Given Up Hope of Reaching Agreement; Toho Newspaper Urges Japanese Cabinet to Negotiate with Soviets</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 31st</p>
<p>The continuing tension in US-Japan relations has not yet reached an extreme; it can still be said to be in a state of stagnation. The Japanese government seems to hold little hope of reaching any large-scale compromise with the United States. However, there is no indication from Tokyo that it is prepared to take any action in the event of the failure of US-Japan talks. The talks have not been interrupted, but their progress is like a snail's pace. The New York Times quoted a Japanese spokesperson in Washington as saying that the Japanese government has almost given up hope of reaching a complete agreement with the United States on the Pacific issue, because the US government insists that any permanent solution to the Pacific issue must involve the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China. Observers here who have close contact with Far Eastern affairs have long expected this important clause. Therefore, the talk of a broad agreement between the US and Japanese governments, which was widely touted in many quarters a few weeks ago, is not worth mentioning. The New York Times also quoted the Japanese spokesperson as saying, "During these talks, there will be some proposals and answers from both sides, but the differences are too great to inspire hope for an early resolution." This spokesperson has confirmed the state of affairs that American observers here have been aware of for weeks. The New York Times says that the general opinion in Washington today is that there is no chance of a general solution, and there is little hope of lifting the oil embargo. The State Department may be preparing to find a way to transport oil from the Dutch East Indies to Japan in exchange for Japan's guarantee not to continue aggressive actions in the South Pacific or Siberia. However, this plan may not be successful.</p>
<p>Future Dangerous Situation; Initiative Remains with Japan</p>
<p>It is almost an open secret today that the United States initially expected that conflict would be almost unavoidable after Tojo took office. Therefore, rumors that Tojo was preparing his troops for war were rampant here at the time. However, it is now known that the situation today is not like that. People here generally believe that Tojo is acting cautiously. The reasons for this are twofold: first, Hitler's failure to capture Moscow or crush the Soviet Union's resistance; and second, advancing into Siberia would inevitably lead to open conflict between Japan and Britain, and even the United States. According to information obtained from here, Japan is still taking various preliminary actions, such as mobilizing 120 divisions in preparation for launching an attack and continuously transporting equipment and supplies. However, there will be no new actions until Moscow is lost. Japan's attempt to reach a compromise with the United States and seek to maintain the status quo of trade is making little progress. The Japanese side has realized that Washington will not abandon many basic points. Since Tojo came to power, US Undersecretary of State Welles has only met with Japanese representatives once. The speed of these US-Japan talks can be inferred from this. According to newspaper reports, while the Japanese admitted that a dangerous situation might arise after the Japanese parliament convenes on November 15, the US-Japan talks have not seen much progress. The Japanese side has not explained where the so-called dangerous situation lies. The reason why Japan has submitted a letter of pleading to the US government, setting a deadline for the US-Japan talks to make progress before November 15, stems from this. In fact, it is Japan, not the United States, that feels the situation is becoming more and more difficult. The embargo is now hitting Japan hard. For this reason, future action remains with Japan. Some people here predict that unless the Japanese parliament remains completely silent, Tojo will face the difficulty of explaining why US-Japan relations have fallen into this dangerous state, what measures he is currently taking, and what he intends to do in the future.</p>
<p>Rumor Japanese Cabinet Has Agreed to First Attack the Burma Road</p>
<p>United Press, London, 31st. Yesterday, information obtained here from sources regarded as reliable claimed that Japan is preparing to launch a strong attack on China before venturing to invade the South. The information claimed that the Japanese cabinet has agreed to first attack the Burma Road, and then make plans to attack Chongqing, in order to make every effort to end the Sino-Japanese war. This news is difficult to confirm here, but they firmly believe that the Japanese army in Manchuria has increased to 35 or 40 divisions.</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 31st. China's army newspaper stated today that the Japanese army has increased its concentration of troops in Shanxi, Henan, and northern Vietnam in preparation for launching a huge pincer attack on Chongqing from both the north and south, and cutting off the Yunnan-Burma Road. The newspaper called on Britain and the United States to take immediate action against Japan, because in order to defeat Hitler, Japan must first be resolved. The newspaper stated that the sole purpose of the British evacuation order is to resolve Japan militarily. China is fighting against the East Asian New Order and the so-called Co-Prosperity Sphere. We hope that Britain and the United States, in addition to understanding this point, will immediately take military action in the same direction.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 31st. The Japan Times today criticized in an editorial the United States' demand to China for the transfer of base areas as compensation for US lend-lease aid to China, and the fact that Chongqing has accepted this in principle. The editorial stated that this transfer of mortgage includes the United States' extensive rights to maintain and utilize undetermined naval bases in China after the establishment of world peace, or as a condition of world peace. (This editorial is clearly based on recent news from Washington that the United States has requested Britain to guarantee the United States' right to utilize British bases around the world, and that the United States has simultaneously proposed to China and Britain a post-war economic reconstruction program.) The newspaper said that Major General Magruder, head of the US military mission to China, asked General Chiang Kai-shek to accept this agreement. The editorial stated that Japan refuses the sinister control scheme, which is currently exerting greater pressure on this country and the Far East. It is now apparent that the lend-lease aid to China is all about expanding the affluent United States. In another editorial, the newspaper stated that "American peace can be achieved through tolerance and concessions to show a more active weakness" to strive for world peace. It also stated that Japan is the only non-belligerent nation with the power to invoke the peace policies initiated by the United States in the most favorable circumstances everywhere in the world. The United States has never shown any preparation to strive for peace in the Pacific. However, any constructive suggestion cannot be considered a sign of weakness. The United States must understand this meaning, and it is not too late now.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 31st. The Kokumin Shimbun urged Tojo not to miss the opportunity to negotiate unresolved issues with the Soviet Union, so that it can use neutrality with fairness and integrity. The newspaper stated that the Soviet Union should cease its aid to China. It also stated that the Soviet Union is currently about to lose its capital, and the war clouds in the Pacific are increasing. Japan's relationship with the Soviet Union can no longer remain uncertain.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Curtin Declares Resolution to Resist Any Aggression; New Zealand People Also Prepared to Defend the Country; British Representative Duff Cooper Scheduled to Arrive in Australia on the 5th</h3>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 31st. Prime Minister Curtin recently spoke in response to German Admiral Raeder's recent suggestion to Japan that Australia is easily invaded, saying that he dares to assert that Japan is far more familiar with the situation than Raeder. His intention is only to try to induce Japan to fight for Germany. A year ago, the Germans propagated that Britain was easy to invade, but now they know better. Australia wishes to see a calm Pacific without any waves, but is determined to resist any aggression, and is fully prepared for this. For two years, Australia has believed that it cannot escape the threat of the enemy, so it has acted on this belief. It is not just Australia that is acting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 31st. New Zealand Minister of Labour Webb recently gave a speech to workers at the Auckland naval base, saying that Germany's recent urging of Japan to join the Axis powers in attacking Australia may also be applied to New Zealand. He believes that Japan knows that attacking Australia and New Zealand will not be easy, and expresses doubt that Japan will heed Germany's persuasion, saying that if Japan does heed it, every citizen of New Zealand will do their utmost.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 31st. Duff Cooper will depart for Australia in the next few days. Before Cooper's arrival, former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick, will soon travel to London via the United States. It is widely believed that Keswick's trip is to bring Cooper's preliminary report on the Far East investigation back to the British Cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 31st. Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced that Duff Cooper, the British Cabinet's special representative to the Far East, will attend next week's meeting of the Australian War Council, and will confer with defense and defense adjustment officials, and will also inspect various military stations and munitions factories. Cooper and his wife and entourage are scheduled to arrive in Australia from Singapore on November 5 and will visit Sydney, Melbourne, and Canberra.</p>
<p>United Press, Manila, 31st. Major General Grunert, commander of the US Army's Philippine Division, has departed for San Francisco aboard a US Army transport ship to report to President Roosevelt. It is widely believed that Lieutenant General MacArthur, commander of the US Far East Command, will concurrently serve as commander of the Philippine Division. Furthermore, Lieutenant Colonel Brereton and Colonel Rockewell will arrive in Cavite on Sunday aboard the Clipper, due to the Clipper's delay in Wake Island. Brereton will serve as commander of the US Far East Air Force, while Rockewell will serve as commander of the 16th Naval District, replacing Rear Admiral Pymus.</p>
<h3>US Army Ordered to Take Over Airplane Factory; President Roosevelt Issues Proclamation; Defense Production Must Not Be Interrupted</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 31st. President Roosevelt last night ordered the Army Department to take over the strike-bound airplane factory of the Aviation Allied Factory in Bendix, New Jersey, so that the production of $5 million worth of military aircraft equipment would not be interrupted by the strike. The President issued this order in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy. In this order, the President directly condemned the company for its dispute with the Aircraft Workers Department of the United Automobile Workers Union, and criticized the company for failing to comply with the National Defense Mediation Board's recommendation that all striking workers should be reinstated. In the order, the President has ordered Secretary of War Stimson to exercise any contractual or other authority on behalf of the company, and to take all measures to ensure production, and if necessary, to use the army. The President also issued a formal proclamation explaining the facts and commenting on the company's mismanagement. He concluded that this step was taken because "our country is currently in extreme danger" and it was necessary to do so. The statement said, "The items produced by the factory are the most critical part of our country's defense. Therefore, I have ordered all workers in the factory to cooperate with the Army Department to ensure a speedy resumption of work." The War Department also announced that Colonel Stimson has ordered Colonel Jones, an Air Corps officer who was on the scene, to preside over the factory, assisted by two majors. Stimson said that he may send troops to the factory to help maintain order. The President's order also stated that the termination date of the government's possession and operation of the factory will be determined by the President himself. When the President believes that this possession and operation are no longer necessary for the national defense interest, it will be terminated.</p>
<h3>US Army Creates Mountain Warfare Unit</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 31st. Secretary of War Stimson announced yesterday that the US Army is creating special units for mountain warfare, because this type of unit has been successful in the European war. He declined to comment on reports that former Export Control Administrator Maxwell will lead an American delegation to the Near East to develop transportation facilities from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea.</p>
<h3>Another US Ship Sunk by Torpedo; While Escorting in the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 31st. The Navy Department recently issued the following statement: The destroyer "Reuben James" was torpedoed and sunk on the night of October 30 while escorting in the Atlantic Ocean west of Iceland. The captain is Lieutenant Commander Edward. No further details have been received yet, but they will be released as soon as they are received. The ship is 314 feet long, 30 feet wide, and has a displacement of 1,190 tons. It usually has 114 sailors and 6 officers. According to the Navy Department, the ship is of the O-type or flush-deck type, similar to those transferred to Britain.</p>
<h3>Britain Watches Japanese Movements; Believes Far Eastern Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st. This morning, all newspapers prominently published Tojo's speech yesterday and the news from Shanghai that the British Embassy had issued a notice warning Britons to evacuate as soon as possible. An editorial in the "News Chronicle" said that although the barometer of the Far Eastern crisis fluctuates, on the whole, the trend is clearly deteriorating. The newspaper concluded that Japan's military and economic problems have become so serious that its only hope of extricating itself lies in the victory of the Axis powers. Therefore, Japan may soon move forward suddenly. The "Daily Mail" also wrote that although Tojo used resolute rhetoric to intimidate the United States and the British Commonwealth, it is very clear that he will not be able to coerce the United States into compromising with him so that he can dominate the Far East. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Manchester Guardian" said that Tojo is eager to consolidate the domestic front to cope with future events. However, it is also very clear that Japanese leaders hope that their war of nerves will help achieve their goals and induce the United States to make concessions. Judging from the situation, Japan seems to have tried to persuade the United States to abandon aid to China in the talks in Washington. However, the firm attitude of the United States has been clearly expressed in these negotiations for the second time. Judging from the measures taken by the Japanese government, it can be seen that Japan is gradually moving towards a state of preparation in economic, political, and military terms. There is currently no immediate sign of an attack on the Soviet Union, but there are many facts that can prove that Japan will prepare to attack the Soviet Union from behind in the event that the Soviet Union collapses. The newspaper concluded that Japan's agreement with Portugal to use Timor as the starting and ending point for air routes can be seen as a sign that those who advocate naval warfare have temporarily gained a slight advantage in Tokyo.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Occurs North of Qixian; Japanese Troops in Northern Henan Attacked by Chinese Forces; Chinese Troops Rush into Gaocun Station and Destroy Japanese Locomotives; Important Stronghold of Qigang South of Zhongmu Captured</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News. (1) On the evening of the 26th, a certain unit of the Chinese army in northern Henan attacked Gaocun Station north of Hongxian. While engaged in combat with the Japanese, a Japanese armored train rushed to the station to reinforce them, firing fiercely with artillery. The Chinese troops moved south of the station, encircling a part of the Japanese forces. Subsequently, the Japanese from Qixian and Miaokou also rushed to reinforce them by different routes. After the Chinese troops divided their forces to intercept them, they were repelled. The Chinese then won the victory and returned. In this battle, the Chinese also destroyed two Japanese bunkers, destroyed one Japanese locomotive, four carriages, and dozens of sections of railway tracks. (2) The Japanese who retreated to Shizishan Changshandong were fiercely attacked by the Chinese pursuit troops. By noon on the 26th, they retreated to Chaoyang in defeat. (3) At 9:00 AM on the 27th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese in Dianqian Street northwest of Nanchang. The Japanese stationed in Niuhang, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to reinforce them, but were ambushed by Chinese troops near Meiling. After two hours of fierce fighting, many Japanese officers and soldiers, including apprentice officer Hyakubishio, were killed or wounded, and many were captured alive. Many light machine guns and rifles were also seized. (31st dispatch)</p>

<p>Luoyang On the afternoon of the 17th, at 4:00 PM, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Qigang southwest of Zhongmu, capturing the area and killing or wounding many Japanese. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission reviewed the war situation of the past week, saying that judging from the Japanese army's attack on the east bank of the Yellow River from Hejin by more than 10,000 troops, and the concentration of Japanese troops increasing in northern Vietnam, it suggests that the Japanese army is currently making pincer movements from the north and south. The Japanese army's offensive in western Shanxi has been blocked by the Chinese side, while the Japanese army's actions in northern Vietnam have continued unabated. On other fronts in China in the past week, there were only small-scale battles in central Hubei and Henan. At the same time, according to telecommunications from the Tongguan battlefield, on October 29, there was fierce fighting all day in Longmen, east of the Yellow River in Jin territory. The Japanese army attempted to gain a stronghold there. As a result of the battle, there were no changes in the positions of either side. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Warehouses to be Established Throughout Free Areas</h3>

<h3>Talk of Abolishing the One-Party System is Tantamount to Sabotaging Resistance and National Reconstruction; Shameless Politicians Loudly Advocating Absurd Theories in Hong Kong; Chongqing's Saodang Pao Publishes Article Criticizing It</h3>
<p>Chongqing The Saodang Pao stated today that currently, shameless politicians are loudly advocating the abolition of the one-party system in Hong Kong and other places. In fact, the Kuomintang is not working for the interests of one party, but serving the interests of the entire country, on the one hand leading China's struggle for freedom and independence, and on the other hand establishing a democratic republic. The national government is produced by the party, and only by supporting the national government can China's victory in resistance and national reconstruction be achieved. Japan not only wants to overthrow the national government, but also wants to overthrow the Kuomintang. From this, it can be seen that the sovereignty of China, the political power, and the party rule are inseparable. The existence of the Kuomintang is the existence of the Republic of China. At the current critical moment, opposition to the one-party system will undermine China's resistance and national reconstruction. Those who launch it are no different from the Fifth Column, and the result will be a repeat of the French tragedy in China. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing Neither official nor private sectors here have paid much attention to the Democratic Political League organized by some people in Hong Kong. In addition to an informal "unheard of" statement in response to the league's declaration that it was "established in Chongqing", the official side has not made any other statements. Privately, it has not been used as a topic of conversation to date. Only the Saodang Bao, the official newspaper of the Political Department, has published an article warning against the tragedy of France. The newspaper reiterated this matter today, stating, "Recently, there have been a very small number of deserters from the fighting camp in Hong Kong who are advocating so-called united party organizations and so-called political alliances. They are reversing black and white and recklessly slandering the party rule that is unanimously supported by the entire country today." It also said, "Under the supreme principle of one-party rule, if there are organizations and activities that violate this principle, the result will inevitably be to disperse the fighting forces, hinder the central government, and affect the sovereignty of the country. No matter what their motives are, in fact, they are no different from carrying out the mission of the Fifth Column for the enemy. Those who support and participate in such organizations and activities, if they do not jointly plan national affairs in the existing public opinion organs (referring to the National Political Council), but just enjoy themselves overseas and talk idly, that is not only contrary to the spirit of democracy, but also undermining the establishment of the democratic politics of the Three People's Principles."

<h3>Situation After the Catastrophe in Changle Street</h3>
<p>Changle Street A reporter recently traveled up the Miluo River from Miluo and arrived at Changle Street, which was recovered by Dong Yu's troops, for an inspection. The hanging bridge erected by the Japanese there has not yet been destroyed. The bridge deck is very low, only suitable for use when the water level of the Miluo River drops. It has a load capacity of 10 tons and is wide enough for cars to travel side by side. The highway that the Japanese repaired from Xiqiang Changhu Dajing Street crosses the river here, and then goes south through Lixiang Mafengzui, and then turns east to Jiangjiaqiao Jinjing. Although the construction of this road is very simple, the construction of the bridge seems to have been prepared in advance. According to eyewitnesses from the local natives, from the 23rd of last month to the 5th of this month, at least more than 500 armored cars and tanks passed through this bridge. These cars were mostly manufactured by the American Ford Company. The Japanese cars carried military supplies when going south, and half carried soldiers and corpses and half carried grain, rice, and clothing when going north. Many sweet potatoes near Changle Street were also taken away by them. At 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a part of the Japanese army that had been defeated and retreated from Changsha set fire when retreating through the northern part of Changle Street. Dong Yu's division, a unit of the Chinese intercepting troops, extinguished it and destroyed a part of the bridge to cut off their retreat. Seeing the critical situation, a Japanese plane landed on the beach by the river in Changle Street to carry its commander to break through and escape to the north. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled on foot in all directions. Changle Street is a famous township in the middle section of the Miluo River. After suffering this catastrophe, it has lost all its vitality. Now, the citizens have returned one after another and are building a new Changle Street in the ruins. (25th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Social Bureau Handles Cigarette Registration</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chongqing Municipal Social Bureau recently issued a notice to handle cigarette registration. All non-merchant businessmen and non-businessmen must register the quantity of cigarettes in their possession with the Social Bureau before November 15th. Businessmen in the trade should register with the trade association. Those who exceed the deadline will have their cigarettes confiscated. The notice also mentioned the recent surge in cigarette prices, which has stimulated general commodity prices and had a significant impact. According to reports, the target of hoarding and speculation is very broad, mainly focusing on food, cotton yarn, and cigarettes. Food is purely a daily necessity, and the government has repeatedly taken measures to crack down and control it. However, stability in food prices still awaits the government's implementation of in-kind collection of land taxes and fixed-price purchases. Hoarders then shift their capital to cigarettes. In the past few months, the price of "Great Britain" brand cigarettes, at 50,000 cigarettes per carton, fluctuated between 7,000 and 8,000 yuan. Disrupted by these people, the price soared to 20,000 yuan per carton in a few days. Initially, the government considered this item not a necessity and did not intervene. However, as a result, it stimulated other commodity prices, and the economic police were dispatched, seizing 2,000 cartons in one fell swoop. Thorough handling would involve a wide range of people. Hoarders were thus somewhat alarmed, and the price of cigarettes also dropped by 3,000 yuan. (Havas News Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Exported Goods Increase, Tung Oil is the Most, Accounting for More Than 70,000 Piculs, Pig Bristles are Transported to Hong Kong by Airplane</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to statistics from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the goods exported from Chongqing to foreign countries in the first nine months of this year, except for sheepskin and deerskin, have increased compared to the same period last year. Among the exported goods, tung oil ranks first, accounting for 78,159 piculs, an increase of 14,234 piculs compared to last year. Pig bristles rank second, accounting for 7,084 piculs, an increase of 1,687 piculs. Raw silk accounted for 1,861 piculs, an increase of 1,219 piculs. Tung oil and raw silk are transported through Burma, pig bristles through Hong Kong, and then exported to other countries. Furthermore, a portion of the pig bristles is transported to Hong Kong by airplane, which also shows its high value. (Havas News Agency, 30th)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Banning Gambling</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It was learned today that Chongqing is strictly prohibiting mahjong and other forms of gambling. In the past two weeks, the police have arrested 600 to 700 people who violated the ban. Ordinary citizens are subject to fines at various levels, but government and bank employees are subject to more severe penalties. It is reported that several people have been sentenced to six months of hard labor. Perhaps because a certain police station was fully focused on the gambling ban, it suddenly discovered yesterday that its weekly food allowance had been stolen by thieves. (United Press, 31st)</p>

<h3>Serious U.S.-German Relations, New York Democratic Representative Proposes Severing Diplomatic Relations with Germany, Armed Merchant Ship Bill Will Eventually Pass the Senate</h3>
<p>United Press, 31st, Berlin: The indications gradually increased here yesterday, showing that President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech finally convinced the Germans that U.S. entry into the war was only a matter of time. Ordinary Germans whom reporters contacted for business or social reasons in the past 48 hours urgently inquired about their views on the meaning of the speech. They repeatedly asked when the United States would enter the war. Observers believe that the severity and swiftness of the German officialdom's response to the speech indicate the seriousness of U.S.-German relations.</p>
<p>United Press, 31st, Washington: New York Democratic Representative Siler proposed in the House of Representatives yesterday, sincerely requesting President Roosevelt to sever diplomatic relations with Germany.</p>
<p>United Press, 31st, Washington: The debate in the Senate over the armed merchant ship bill became more intense yesterday, but private opposition sources stated that they could not gain additional support, so they believed that the Senate would pass the amendment. Utah Democratic Senator Thomas defended the amendment, saying that the Senate's refusal to grant President Wilson's request to arm merchant ships in 1917 was a "mistake," as the United States was thereby drawn into the war. He also said, "The war came about purely due to small events. Hitler is now threatening the world as a tyrant, just like the dark age when Genghis Khan roamed the world. Sensible people, those who do not love war, our country is fortunate if we can achieve our goals without fighting." Northern California Democratic Senator Bailey said that if the United States adopts a tough policy, it may be easier to avoid war than to allow "Hitler to kick us."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Do Not Let Necessities Become Hoarded Goods</h3>
<p>Having goods is having wealth, without manipulation, without hoarding, and with self-appreciation; the arrival of this wealth is as if bestowed by heaven, unrelated to human effort. This is the proud saying of those in the industrial and commercial circles and among the hoarders. Tracing back to the continuous soaring of commodity prices, ten times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times different, with metals, Western medicines, building materials, coal, rice, flour, yarn, cotton, and imported goods being the most prominent. The emergence of newly rich individuals with fortunes of one or two tens of millions is not uncommon in today's society. Who would believe that this is not war profiteering? Without national crisis, how could it come to this? The god of war is an evil god, posing a serious threat to general life, and it is painful to speak of. The god of war is also a god of wealth. Those who profit from the national crisis are delighted with him.</p>
<p>Medicines are used to treat people, but some who have medicines refuse to respond to the needs of the sick, and deliberately raise their prices, resulting in death before treatment. Yarn, cloth, rice, and flour are mostly hoarded, causing more than just hunger and cold, but also the threat of starvation. Hoarding coal and being reluctant to sell it leads to a great fuel shortage. The value of metals increases tenfold or a hundredfold, not only causing the cost of industrial products to soar, but also making everyday utensils extraordinarily expensive. The chaotic rise in prices of imported goods can be described as having no fair market. How can people not suffer, and hoarding not flourish?</p>
<p>However, looking back at the lives of the masses, vitality fades daily as commodity prices rise; savings dwindle as hoarding intensifies. All industries are said to be making fortunes, but the business of shops is constrained by purchasing power and becomes increasingly evident. The early closure of night markets is becoming more frequent. The usual so-called profits are all spoken of in terms of the amount of currency that can be obtained from the buying and selling of goods. Before the goods are sold, the profit is still uncertain. Today's legal tender, not to make a malicious argument, is thought by some to be treading the path of the Mark and Ruble. This shows a lack of understanding of the differences between the situations in Germany and Russia at that time and China today. If there were to be a major unprecedented change in legal tender, why would there be the various measures currently being taken? This shows that those who doubt the legal tender are wrong. Furthermore, observing recent events, the movement of legal tender to the south is substantial; the relocation of funds inland is both encouraged and guaranteed, clearly showing signs of contraction in Shanghai's currency. Looking again at the Stabilization Fund's announcement, "Regarding the large quantities of necessities stored in Shanghai, the foreign exchange supply previously stipulated was quite generous, but recent speculative activities and widespread hoarding have caused prices to rise, which is deeply regrettable. However, the Stabilization Fund intends to increase the convenience of foreign exchange for transporting necessities to areas in China that have not fallen and to refugee areas, no matter what." Looking at this, people in Shanghai do not need to worry excessively about foreign exchange for necessities. The only hope is that the goods that can be obtained are not manipulated by the magic of speculative hoarding and do not fall into its clutches!</p>
<p>The authorities in the two concessions are now working on this. The Superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council's recent remarks at a reception for reporters on adjusting prices within the concessions are mainly aimed at controlling the previous lax management. If this is followed and not just treated as a formality, it will be of great help in leveling prices and stabilizing life. It should be known that the government still supplies Shanghai with foreign exchange for necessities, solely for the welfare of the Chinese and Western people. Speaking of leakage, blocking is the best policy. It is also for the sake of the business of friendly merchants. Otherwise, there are some things that are not absolutely essential for life, and they are also given foreign exchange assistance. However, desires are endless, and financial resources are limited. If the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai do not have the spirit of hard work and thrift in wartime and only seek current enjoyment, continuing to squander Chinese financial resources and consume them on unnecessary items, the regret will be seen, and there may be a day when it cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what is called a necessity has no fixed definition and varies with the level of life. For example, gasoline. When used for police vehicles, fire trucks, ambulances, and other emergency services, and when there is no choice but to use a car, it is certainly a necessity. However, if it is used for commuting, going for a drive, and enjoying oneself, it is not based on general life standards. It is for enjoyment and cannot be called a necessity. What is essential for general life should be allowed as a necessity, and it is not permissible to only consider the convenience of a certain stage or type of person as a necessity. Furthermore, the raw materials supplied with foreign exchange must not be used to frequently raise prices after they become products, such as tobacco and cigarettes. Nor can they be manipulated by people in the industry and hoarders, using warehouse receipts for trading, so that genuine consumers have to seek high prices and even sigh that they cannot obtain them. Nor should they be absorbed and monopolized by people in the industry, such as British and American medicines, whose sources have never been interrupted, but are still difficult to obtain, which is hardly the original intention of supplying medicines with foreign exchange to benefit patients! Now that the concession authorities are working for the welfare and survival of the citizens within the concessions, do not let necessities become hoarded goods, and do not allow people to be delighted with the fact that having goods is having wealth. This is what the public looks forward to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a prerequisite for stabilizing commodity prices</p>
<p>In recent days, in the Shanghai market, various speculative trades have been soaring in price, as if in a frenzy. As a result, everyday items have become extraordinarily expensive, causing the small people who barely survive to fall into deeper water and fire, making it difficult to struggle, and harming people's livelihoods without end.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of normal commodity prices may be due to cost, or due to supply and demand, or due to currency value. There should be clues to follow, and the degree of rise and fall should also have a certain limit. But this is not the case now. In a matter of days, the price of gold has more than doubled, reaching over 20,000 yuan per bar. It is clear that this is not entirely due to cost, supply and demand, or currency value. Ordinary items only follow the lead of gold. As the price of gold rises, all things rise with it. As a result, speculators are increasingly pursuing long positions, and those with capital are competing to hoard. As a result, each item, because of more hoarding and less circulation, becomes more expensive, which is more beneficial to those who take long positions and hoard. This continues in a cycle, causing prices to gradually increase without end. In a word, nothing is free from the mischief of gold, which is the worst of instigators.</p>
<p>To relieve people's livelihood, commodity prices must be stabilized. And to get to the root of the problem, gold prices must be suppressed. Gold is owned by the state, as has long been stipulated. And the authorities are extremely concerned about the livelihood of the people, so illegal buying and selling of gold, arbitrarily raising its value, causing all things to be stimulated and prices to increase daily, severely harming our people, goes against the authorities' intention to love the people. Moreover, judging from the current market situation, the long positions may seem to be gaining double profits, and it is not difficult to become a wealthy family. But who knows that shaking up the market, disturbing livelihoods, and continuing in this way will inevitably lead to a disaster that cannot be saved. Once commerce stagnates, people become panic-stricken, and society becomes unstable, if the skin is gone, where will the hair be attached? This is also what speculators cannot but hope to reflect on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, banks handle pledges to facilitate commerce and regulate finance. But now, speculators use the goods they hoard to pledge to banks for cash, and then use this pledge to continue buying goods and hoarding. After several transformations, the total value of the hoarded goods can exceed the original capital by several times. This uses the funds for regulating the commercial and financial sectors to destroy the livelihood of the common people. The harm is unspeakable. In order to save the market and protect their own safety, all banks should suspend handling pledges for goods during this period, and urge the redemption of those already pledged. In this way, the strength of speculators will be greatly reduced, and the hoarding trend will be far less than before. And many of the goods already hoarded will have to be sold in order to repay the pledge. Once the hoarded goods are circulated, commodity prices will naturally fall, maintaining people's livelihood. This is especially urgent, and we cannot help but look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Fierce German Offensive on the Outskirts of Moscow, Intense Battles Unfold for the City of Tula</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, London: According to the latest Soviet communiqué, Soviet forces are currently holding their positions in the areas of Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets, and Tula, resisting the fierce attacks of the Nazi forces. Yesterday, the German forces repeatedly tried to break through the Soviet lines, but were repelled, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, 47 German aircraft were shot down near Moscow. This communiqué confirms the reports from the Soviet news agency that Soviet forces in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas are launching counterattacks and that the German forces have made little progress. The news agency also stated that Soviet forces have occupied the suburbs of the two cities "N" and "D," and fierce battles are underway. A major battle has begun in the Volokolamsk area after the German forces launched a new offensive. The Soviet side admits that the German forces have made some progress in this area, but their casualties have been severe. Volokolamsk is located halfway between Mozhaisk and Kalinin. The German claim that they have broken through the Perekop Isthmus and entered the Crimean Peninsula has not yet been confirmed. The Soviet side also reported that Soviet forces in Rostov-on-Don have been reinforced and are continuing to resist.</p>
<p>Reuters, 31st, London: According to news received here, German forces are currently pressing hard on Moscow. The most dangerous offensive is one launched from Tula. The Soviet side admits that the situation is serious, but says that it has contained the German forces at every point on the arc-shaped line defending the Soviet capital. If the German offensive from Tula continues unabated, it may be an attempt to bypass Moscow and then attack the Soviet capital from the east.</p>
<p>International News Service, 31st, Kuibyshev: Soviet reports state that German forces today launched fierce attacks on four routes along the arc-shaped line in front of Moscow, through muddy snow-covered ground, but all offensives were repelled. The Soviet side admits that the recent German offensive may represent the greatest threat to the Soviet capital since the war began, but it is widely believed that the Red Army's defenses will be able to hold, and the German forces will not be able to occupy Moscow. The communiqué stated that the Red Army has recaptured several important positions in front of Rostov on the southern front. As for the Crimean front, the German forces have so far failed to build a bridgehead to facilitate their further advance. At the same time, the Red Army has launched an offensive on the Leningrad front and is currently fighting fiercely with the German forces on the outskirts of the city. A Soviet spokesman said that new industries are booming in eastern European Soviet Union. These industries have established a "factory front" for the Soviet forces, enabling them to fight permanently.</p>
<p>United Press, 31st, London: News exchanged in Kuibyshev reports that German forces have launched a new offensive on Crimea with countless tanks, artillery, and aircraft.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 31st, Moscow: German forces are now launching a fierce attack on the city of Tula. The city is located in an important location and has a population of 200,000. It is located on the banks of the Upa River, a tributary of the Volga River, and is also one of the Soviet Union's industrial centers. The surrounding area is rich in coal and iron ore deposits.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 30th, Budapest: An official announcement stated that Hungarian forces have broken through Red Army resistance and have reached the Donets River.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ten Years of Purge Movement, German and Japanese Spies Eliminated, Stalin's Vision Far-Sighted</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, New York: Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, published an article in American Magazine, stating that Stalin's Soviet purge movement in the recent ten years aimed to eliminate German and Japanese spies within the Soviet Union. The world mostly refers to the famous treason cases and the purge movement from 1935 to 1938 as hateful examples of barbarism, cruelty, and ingratitude. However, viewing the current facts and researching all the records, it is known that the defendants at that time were all figures employed by the headquarters of the German and Japanese armies, which is indeed beyond doubt.

<p>TASS, 31st, Moscow: The Soviet Council of People's Commissars announced a decree promoting four people, including Voroshilov, to the rank of Lieutenant General of the Air Force, and eighteen people, including Belikhiv, to the rank of Major General of the Air Force.</p>
<h3>British Wartime Cabinet, Rumored to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, London: Lord Beaverbrook's asthma attack has led political critics to anticipate a possible general change in the cabinet, and speculate that after his recovery, Beaverbrook will go on to a more senior position. Many members of industry and parliament are still determined to demand more planned production of war equipment. The Prime Minister opposes the establishment of a dedicated production department, arguing that this move may not facilitate production. However, if the Prime Minister changes his mind, Beaverbrook's selection as minister of this department seems to be a matter of course.</p>
<h3>Thailand Prepares to Deal with Contingencies, National Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply, Thai-Vietnamese Trade Relations Resume</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, Bangkok: The Thai Minister of Finance disclosed the contents of the upcoming 1942 November-December fiscal bill when hosting news reporters yesterday. The entire national defense budget is Baht 101,000,000 (equivalent to £10,000,000 British gold). This is Thailand's unprecedented national defense expenditure, because in the full year from January 1939 to September 1940, national defense expenditure was only Baht 30,000,000 (equivalent to £3,000,000 British gold). Although Thailand has decided to strictly adhere to neutrality, it is also preparing to deal with various contingencies. This can be seen from the large increase in national defense expenditure. The Minister of Finance also announced that there is no need to collect new direct taxes, which is greatly welcomed by the business community.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 30th, Vichy: A government gazette recently stated that land trade between Vietnam and Thailand, which had been banned by both governments after the Thai-Vietnamese conflict, will resume within days.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesman Ishii Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, Tokyo: When hosting news reporters this morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii said that he could not confirm the local newspapers' reports that the US-Japan talks would have a tangible turn before the Parliament holds an extraordinary meeting on November 15. When reporters asked about improper pressure on the Japanese side's interests in Nanyang, Ishii admitted to foreign reporters that this was a question of quantity and not a qualitative question, and admitted that the interests of foreigners frozen in Japan are currently facing the same difficulties, but that the Japanese side's interests are more affected. Ishii also said that Soviet floating mines seem to have disappeared, probably because the Soviet Union is more cautious than before in placing mines. Regarding the appointment of the Japanese ambassador to the UK, there is currently no action, but there is no special reason why the Japanese side has been slow to announce this appointment. Ishii declined to criticize President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech, or to ask for his thoughts on the US President's statement that the United States will continue to help Chongqing. Ishii only said that the US President had repeatedly made similar statements. When reporters asked about the report that Japan intends to set up an air force base in Macau as a result of the establishment of an aviation agreement between Portugal and Japan, Ishii replied that he was not aware of it, but since Japan has an air force base in Guangzhou, which is very close to Macau, there is no need to set up such a base in Macau again. Reporters also asked about the reaction in Japan to a rumor that the UK and the US had reached an agreement to hand over British naval ports, including Hong Kong and Singapore, to the US for use. Ishii replied that if this statement is true, Japan would feel concerned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Aizawa Goes to Vietnam to Take Up His New Post</h3>

<h3>Two U.S. Passenger Plane Crashes, Total of Thirty-Four Deaths</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, St. Thomas, Ontario: A passenger plane belonging to an American airline crashed and burned last night fourteen miles from here, killing all twenty people on board.

<p>Reuters, 19th, Ankara (Delayed): The Turkish military held large-scale exercises at the racecourse today to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. Nazi Ambassador von Papen also sat in the diplomatic section to watch the exercises for an hour. The exercises included aircraft performances, paratrooper landings, flamethrowers, smoke machines, mountain artillery, infantry, horse-drawn artillery, mechanized units towing American-made howitzers, British-made anti-aircraft guns, and flat-shooting artillery. However, the Nazi ambassador did not see all of the civil state's war equipment, such as American-made Tomahawk and British-made Hurricane aircraft. Before the exercises, President Ismet Inönü addressed the audience.</p>
<h3>British Collection of Waste Paper Movement, With 100,000 Tons as Standard, For Use in Manufacturing Cartridge Boxes</h3>
<p>Reuters, 31st, London: Since Minister of Supply Beaverbrook issued an appeal to the public to collect 100,000 tons of waste paper for use in manufacturing cartridge boxes, within ten days, the national newspapers, business community, and public have responded enthusiastically, aiming to reach the standard stipulated by several local authorities of collecting one ton of waste paper per month from 1,000 residents. Before the start of this movement, local authorities across the country collected an average of half a ton of waste paper per month from 1,000 residents. If this can be doubled, it can save 25,000 tons of ships carrying paper from the US to the UK.</p>

<h3>On the Common People of China</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck</p>
<p>The recently published China issue of Asia Magazine features articles by renowned writers such as Edgar Snow, Ms. Utley, Ms. Pearl S. Buck, and Dr. Lin Yutang, all praising the unparalleled and historically significant nature of China's war effort and its inevitable victory. Ms. Pearl S. Buck, as a renowned novelist, discusses the common people of China, offering a perspective deeply rooted in life's philosophy, incisive, profound, and with implied meanings. Below is a selective translation of the original article, deemed suitable for publication. - Editor</p>
<p>One day, I stood on a street corner in Nanjing, which was then the capital of revolutionary China. A young man was giving a speech to a crowd, their interest piqued, listening intently. His topic was a way of life that he offered to the masses, one that would bring immense benefits. It was a time of change; months prior, a significant revolution had occurred in Nanjing. Old officials were forced into exile, and soon after, young people like the speaker eagerly took power. At the time, I was not yet accustomed to revolutionary China and found the speech rather distasteful. Had the old China truly passed, had everything I once knew vanished? What were the crowd listening thinking?</p>
<p>Eventually, the young man with long hair distributed light red tickets. Everyone except me received one. Instead of giving me one, he stared at me for a moment, and then, without warning, spat on my face. A dozen hands reached out, offering handkerchiefs and cloths to wipe it off. The voices were a cacophony of fervent curses. "Bastard!" "Despicable wretch!" An old woman tugged at my sleeve, leading me to an old-fashioned stove. "Come inside – this old woman always has hot water, and a bar of soap too." I washed my face with soap and hot water, thanking her for her kindness. As I was about to leave, I noticed a light red ticket on the floor. It was her ticket; I picked it up.</p>
<p>"Bring this to the First Factory established by the Revolutionary Army, and you can find employment." That's what the red ticket said. Knowing she was illiterate, I read it aloud to her.</p>
<p>"Is that what the ticket says?" she asked, her tone filled with disdain.</p>
<p>"Exactly," I said. "You should keep it safe – it's very hopeful."</p>
<p>She laughed. "These many young lads!" she said comfortably. "Who would believe them?"</p>
<p>"Why not believe them?" I said. "People believe many things these days."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Yes, but not these things! Who ever heard of people working for nothing? Going to work at a factory, and me not being his relative, nor asking him for a job. No, there's no such person. We'll wait and see." She tore the ticket into pieces and threw them away.</p>
<p>I walked down the street. In the mud, on the wet cobblestones, I saw many tickets stuck. Everyone lived happily in their own way. They listened with curiosity to the young man's preaching, but had never heard such strange ideas. They accepted the hope he offered with one hand, and threw it away with the other. In China, no one trusts what can be doubted.</p>
<p>In these present times, whenever the Chinese people repeatedly listen to the hope given to them, I often recall this story. Which path will they take? Their own path, I know. Other paths are impossible. The world is divided not only between Fascist and democratic politics between nations, but also between individuals. The common people of China do not have this distinction at present. In a nation, society, and family that are greatly divided, the enemy can enter one's own home in a unique and terrible way. Of all the nations existing on Earth since history began, the Chinese people are among the most democratized in character. Is the Chinese nation a continuous lineage? It has been four thousand years. This often gives rise to inappropriate doubts. They are like a memorial fragment, vast in size, obscuring everything from our view. If this were merely a statue, a temple, or a palace, ancient and still practically usable today, it would be a marvel, a sensation for everyone. But this is a nation, the largest nation in the world today, vast in land, with a population accounting for one-sixth of the world's total. Many aspects of the country still retain a medieval state, developing affairs of state at its own pace, not keeping pace with world evolution. Though repeatedly subjected to the encroachments of modern weaponry created by scientists with their minds and energy fully exhausted, it continues to survive. And, despite having no significant resources beyond its vast land, it grows stronger and tougher than it was when the war began. This is China. China has a greater significance because of its vast people and land.</p>
<p>When people speak of the term "nation," it always encompasses more than just land and people. It must include ports, air force, industry, natural resources, imports and exports, military strength, and so on. But China only has people and land. The ports have now been lost, and there are not many to begin with. The air force is extremely small; the Chinese cannot expand a strong air force. From a modern perspective, the development of industry is also not far-reaching. The large enterprises that once existed in a few cities have now disappeared. They have always neglected natural resources other than agriculture. Trade with other countries has not been very active, as they had long anticipated that it would cause trouble. Military force has been traditionally disdained for centuries, with a firm belief that the upper classes would not engage in warfare.</p>
<p>A viewpoint less suited to the modern world is almost unimaginable. When heavily armed Japan attacked China, many people, while acknowledging that China had fully demonstrated resilience in past conquests, were extremely doubtful about its national strength today, because science had perfected all kinds of lethal weapons. According to common sense, China's response was completely unprepared. The domestic troops were untrained, there were very few aircraft, a complete lack of heavy artillery, no modern war experience, and a lack of practical reasons to hope for victory in any way. But everyone knew that the Chinese people demanded war. They responded not to defend land, they even planned strategic retreats, losing vast amounts of land; not to defend certain cities, some cities were voluntarily abandoned, or put to the torch; not even to defend their own lives, lives were disregarded, sacrificed under Japanese arms. The Chinese people fight to defend their right to live as they choose, to become a free and unconquerable nation. Cities can be rebuilt, lost territories can be recovered, because the fundamental land remains, unalterable and indestructible. The Chinese people do not want to be dominated; they are not a nation that can survive under submission.</p>
<p>What kind of people are these many Chinese? Most of them are common people. A very small percentage of the Chinese population is the upper class, 85% are farmers, they live in small villages, making a living from the land. Of the remaining 15%, 10% belong to the small merchant class. The remaining 5% includes the wealthy, the intellectuals, and the ruling class.</p>
<p>Therefore, these common people are China. They made their demands clear, and thus the nation spoke. So they demanded to fight Japan, and the war began, even though the government leaders knew that the defensive weaponry was extremely poor. But the government leaders also knew that the best defense was the spirit of the general public.</p>
<p>In other countries, corruption within can make this public opinion worth considering. China, however, is a country that will not be overthrown. China is unwilling to give itself away to the invaders, nor will it hand itself over to its own appeasers. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Gold Trading Suspended for Spot Transactions - From $23,100 to $21,600</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai black market, October futures were settled and cleared. The market only engaged in cash transactions, with significant fluctuations, rising and falling sharply. Continuing the upward momentum from the previous day, amidst consistent buying, the price soared again past the $23,000 mark, actually reaching an unprecedented new peak of $23,100. Later, the Association, realizing that the recent gold price had soared excessively, causing various goods to take the opportunity to rise in price, disrupting the financial system, coordinated with relevant industry peers, such as Tianyuan, Dafeng, Xianghe, Defu, and cash shops and money houses to sell, suppressing the manipulation, and the price retreated below the $22,000 mark. At noon, the close was down $250, with about 4,000 taels traded in half a day. At noon, the Association announced that it originally operated spot forward trading in Shanghai red gold. However, it has been found that a small number of brokers in this city market privately engage in over-the-counter spot transactions, for which the Association does not take responsibility. From now on, brokers are not allowed to engage in spot transactions in this city market, resulting in the suspension of cash trading in the afternoon. However, it was heard that a certain money house sold at an off-market price of $21,600, down another $400, causing jewelry gold to initially reach an unprecedented high of $2,350, eventually falling back to $2,200, down $50.</p>
<p>Cash Off-Market Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Shanghai red gold spot, inheriting the surprising upward momentum of the previous day, inevitably had residual momentum. The market opened and was immediately raised by $250, to $22,500. Gonghe, Decheng, Yutaifeng, and retail investors competed to push up the price, rising to a new high of $23,100. Soon after, Tianyuan and others began selling, stopping the rise, and a downward trend began, falling back $900, to $22,200. After a brief period of absorption by Hesheng Hong Kong banks, it was pushed up again, rising to $22,900 around 10:30. Soon after, Tianyuan and others competed to sell, and Xiangxing Yongfu sold, and the downward trend intensified, gradually falling $1,000, declining to $21,190. Xinyuan vigorously purchased, and Tianyuan also entered, raising the price to $22,500. Finally, under the selling pressure from Tianyuan and others, it was pressed down to a noon close of $22,000, $250 lower than the previous day. The high and low in the first half of the day was $1,200, and after the close, it rose to $22,200. Finally, at $21,800, there were sellers. In the afternoon, the off-market price retreated to $21,600, and the market price of the cash shop's own brand gold was $21,900, a reduction of about $1,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Has Transactions - $2.75 for US Dollars, US Notes Up to $39</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday, both the Central Bank and Bank of Communications postings were flat, and the over-the-counter prices for British and American currencies also remained unchanged. There were even fewer sellers quoting prices on the black market for British and American currencies, and the market situation continued to be tight. An import sugar trading company managed to snatch up current US dollars at an unprecedentedly high price of $2.75, sold by a businessman with a large amount. British exchange also reached a new tight price of 1 shilling 8.75 pence, and only then did exporters offer to sell at the above price, which then slightly hardened. In the afternoon, buyers tended to wait and see because the price was too high, so the closing price for British exchange was 2 shillings, and for US exchange was $3, both with prices being offered for fewer supplies, slightly tightening. Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was slightly softer, with British and American gold pounds each falling by $10. British gold notes sharply fell by $8, and US gold notes had initially risen to as high as $39.20, but in the afternoon, it retreated to $37.40, eventually being $38, a fall of 80 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes still had demand for positions, rising to as high as $8.10 in the evening market. Japanese gold notes continued to rise strongly, rising to $3.45 in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was still balanced, and the evening market still stood at the original price of $2.80.</p>
<h3>Double Horse Yarn After Settlement - Up to $2,900 - Futures Rose to the Limit and Then Up Another $150 - Nianzhihui Brand Yarn Also Jumped $200-300</h3>
<p>The spot market for yarn suddenly soared, and the sentiment was unprecedented. This was because the gold price was wildly volatile, which made buyers extremely excited. There was a great sense of yarn shortage in the market. As long as sellers were willing to let go, buyers would be straightforward and quick to grab it. Such a situation had never been seen before. The average price of 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn jumped by a huge $200-300. It was said that the raw materials were expensive, the factory's costs had increased, or there were measures to reduce labor, so households with ample economic resources vigorously absorbed it. At the same time, the exchange and the Jinshuangma market could not open and stopped trading. Speculators were unanimously proceeding to the spot market. The high price of 20-count double horse factory singles was $2,900 to $880, and after closing it was $2,820-30. In the afternoon, it was rumored that it had reached $3,000. In the afternoon, the exchange opened, the yarn rose $119.90, the cloth rose $4.50, and all stored chips were settled clearly. Future new transactions will be made according to new policies.</p>
<p>The Jinshuangma futures market, after the October delivery, has begun trading. Its market price is rising, and buying interest is looming. The actual yarn factory single was announced to settle at $2,370.00, and the market sentiment turned steady. The futures market opened, and the trend was surprisingly high. General practitioners fueled the flames, making great strides. The prosperity of the buying interest was unprecedented. The market price jumped sharply. The November opening rose to the limit of $2,448. December 1504, also rose to the limit, and January followed, rising to the limit of $2,558, while the dark market for near and far terms, after being blindly raised by general speculators, actually rose by more than $150-60 each. Such a market state can be called unprecedented. However, observing that the factory single has risen sharply and stopped briefly, and prices have risen sharply with it, the lives of the common people have been hit hard, so its settlement price is stable, and the futures yarn has shown a fierce upward trend again. The future is difficult to predict, but practitioners should still be more cautious. The results all rose to the limit.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation followed the yarn market and continued to rise, and those holding goods were unwilling to release them, which shows the strength of people's hearts in general. The market price rose by a distance of $20-30.</p>
<p>Fire engine grass bag 500 bags $550.0 Hongzhang Factory</p>
<p>One hundred and one pieces of Yimula $655.0 Jiajinjia</p>
<p>Another 100 pieces $650.0 also</p>
<p>One hundred pieces of Pingguoer $520.0 also</p>
<p>One hundred pieces of coarse velvet packed $560.0 also</p>
<p>One hundred pieces of Meipeng Singapore $870.0 also</p>
<p>Two hundred pieces of Lanhua $620.0 also</p>
<p>Another 200 pieces $618.0 also</p>
<p>Another 200 pieces $590.0 also</p>
<p>New York cotton market rose due to excessive rainfall in the Mississippi River basin, which had an impact on cotton production. Fellow traders and New Orleans bought more actively. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by eight or nine pounds of sound compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and speculators, but later suddenly turned back down due to the looming war clouds in the Far East and Japan gradually entering a state of war. Yesterday's closing prices each fell by about one rupee. It is also predicted that the opening market situation today will rise by two rupees.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Publicly Sells Rice - Special Ship Arrives at the Port - Fluctuations are Nothing More Than Speculation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's affordable-priced foreign rice continued to arrive in large quantities at the port. Yesterday morning, Jardine Matheson's Taisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai, specially loaded with 20,400 bags of affordable-priced foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong, with no other cargo. It is currently docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, the company's Yongsheng Wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon around 3 o'clock, also carrying 5,892 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, as passenger cargo, and is docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>In the morning, there was a small batch of newly arrived affordable-priced foreign rice, and the people's hearts were stabilized by the large supply to the sales outlets, and the market was quite fair. Moreover, some floating households released profits, and the spot price of the small batch gradually dropped from $162.50 to $158-9. The supply was sufficient, and actual sales were flat, so the market could have been stable, but speculators and line merchants and pie-merchants took the opportunity to absorb them, and rumors and the soaring gold price suddenly rose again. Large households inside and outside the industry and floating merchants and other households followed suit, and for a time it was cloudy. Yinzhan Small Grain opened at $161, and foreign shops at $160. However, the general floating households, because of the affordable rice, took advantage of the high price to come out again, and then returned to fatigue. Yinzhan Small Grain fell to $159, and foreign shops to $158, intending to lure the enemy in deep, and taking the cheap opportunity to absorb it. There were also additional purchases in actual sales, and the situation suddenly tightened, and each price rose again. The closing price of Yinzhan Small Grain returned to $163, and foreign shops to $162, No. 1 Saigon high goods $185-6, ordinary $183-4, Zhongguan $181-2, No. 2 $164 half, followed by $160, No. 1 Siam $176.20, followed by $172, No. 2 $161-160, high $164, Java tip high $180-178, Zhongguan $175, broken tip high from $135 acupoint, followed by $129,</p>
<p>This is five or six yuan higher than the previous morning's closing price, and the British China Division has risen by three or five yuan from 191.5 to 192.3 yuan. The results are three or five yuan higher than the previous market, with more than 30,000 bags transacted. The British China Division has nearly 1,000 tons. As for the current inventory, there are a total of 92,513 bags, which is 62,605 bags less than the previous period. A total of 34,161 bags were delivered this week.</p>
<p>The arrival of new thick and thin broken japonica rice is slightly sparse, with only a hundred or so stones. Because the price of foreign rice has tightened, the sales market has also become lively, rising by one or two yuan. The early break of Kainangang is $191-2, the new Kunshan japonica is $191-2, the Qingjiao Mizhong and Fenjing Baige are all $191-2, the wild rice is out of stock and there is no market, and the glutinous rice has a large number of Jindan Guonuo arriving at the port, with a total of five or six hundred bags, and subsequent batches continue to be shipped to Shanghai, so people's hearts are slightly calm. Hong Kong Baiyuan is opened at a high price of $200, followed by $195, Glutinous Lu is $183-4, and Jindan Guonuo is $195.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Wildly Rises - Actually Asking for $60</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the speculative atmosphere for foreign flour became more and more intense, and the price of American Kemp flour increased by about $5, because the large households in the industry have been firmly holding on and refusing to sell at a low price in the evening, and new merchants, customers, and floating households are all excitedly absorbing it. The market has already seen a direct increase in cash prices. Yesterday, due to rumors and favorable environmental factors, and also because of the North Exchange relationship, buyers were even more enthusiastic, but the actual sales in the streets only need 8,000 bags, or even 10,000 bags, while there are more than one million in stock. The customer help enters a lot and loads less, which is also a thoughtful transaction. Yesterday, the speculative groups disregarded the people's food and continued to raise prices. The Pao Tai morning market was $55, followed by an increase of one or two yuan, reaching $58.60 and still lacking sales. In the evening market, there were actually calls for $60. Jinlong's early market was $53, and in the afternoon it reached $56.50, with calls for $57. The speculative appetite has not yet been satisfied, and the poor have no day to survive. It is hoped that the two authorities will truly realize the sale at a fair price as soon as possible, and especially that the existing flour should be drawn in advance for a fair price. On the one hand, they should persuade merchants and firms with goods to sell them quickly, and on the other hand, they should only allow actual sales in this street to be bought, and then the market will be better.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Turn Around in the Afternoon - Foreign Stocks Become Active Again</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds, yesterday the market sentiment was still weak and soft, in the morning, the C type once broke through the $5 mark, and then saw a new small price of $4.70, but because the decline was too large, it then rushed out of $5 again. In the afternoon, the market sentiment was stronger, and it once reached as high as $6, but it still retreated into $6 due to being unsupported. The ups and downs of the B type were even greater, with a high-low difference of $1.50. After the violent decline, there was a sudden sharp rise, and it seemed that it would temporarily tend to hover in such a daze. Yesterday morning, Runde Tongsunde Changjiu Feng and the newly listed Senchanghao also had quite a few transactions, but Yixun's sales were quite strong. The B type opened at $67.60 and fell straight to $6.30. Yuhe Yitai Xiehe Yuanyongkang Runli also sold one after another. The noon close rebounded slightly, falling by a few cents. The situation improved in the afternoon, and the selling pressure was slightly reduced, with a sharp increase of half a yuan to one yuan. Datong Lianhe Hongda Yitai and Renfeng all had purchases. On the 25th, Shengxing Dingkang Xinfeng Runde and others all sold, but the trend has turned to demand exceeding supply, and the C type has seen $6, and the B type has returned high and is approaching $8. In summary, the D type fell by 70 cents due to not falling the day before, and the E type continued to be small by 25 cents, while the rest have recovered by about 10 cents, with a total turnover of about $2.12 million. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 300 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of $69.00. Various Chinese merchant stocks were also quite active.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Public Industry Institute has become active again, and the general prices are higher than the previous close. The upward trend of yarn factory stocks is particularly strong, and new high prices are seen stacked up. Other stocks such as Qia Beer and Paper also have new prices found, while the upward trend of the rest is relatively moderate. The trend of rubber stocks is firm, and it is more than enough than industrial stocks.</p>
<h3>Futures Sugar Rushes Out of the $300 Mark</h3>
<p>The sugar market was stimulated and skyrocketed by the gold tide, and the November 20th futures rushed out of the $300 mark, so trading was suspended. The afternoon was slightly calmer. As a result, it rose by about $14. Spot rose by $21-2 to $18. Dutch Red rose by $8. The price of the Car White rose by $18 to $20. The company's futures for 24th crude white on November 10th initially was $291, then to $93, and the 20th was $302, all of which were suspended from trading. The afternoon turned calm.

The 20th opened at $302 and closed at $299, the highest being $305 and the lowest being $96. Over-the-counter was $99.

<p>Sugar has arrived in Shanghai in succession. The previous day, TaiKoo Company's Hanyang Wheel transported more than 2,000 packages from Hong Kong, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Jardine Matheson Company's Yongsheng transport arrived at the port yesterday, also bringing 3,006 packages of sugar from Hong Kong, docking at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.

<h3>Tongdeli Coal Still Sells Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Tongdeli white coal, since the new goods arrived the other day, the industry and its merchants have calculated in US dollars, which has been criticized by all walks of life and is very inconvenient, so since the other day, the previous agreement has been abandoned and it has been changed to selling legal tender. No. 1 and No. 2 pieces are opened at $750 per ton, and colleagues can pick it up by themselves, limited to current sales and no warehouse receipts are issued, so people's hearts have calmed down recently and the market atmosphere has flattened. It is hoped that the colleagues who manage Hongji White Coal can also follow suit, open up current sales, and not hoard them all the time, causing the black market to soar wildly and affect people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Li De'er and Others to Soon Depart for Hong Kong: Comprehensive Planning for Foreign Exchange Matters; Unprecedented Actions Taken to Suppress and Stabilize Prices; Market Chaos Expected to Turn Around</h3>
<p>The Stabilization Committee Will Supply Essential Goods and Foreign Exchange with a New Approach</p>
<p>According to news yesterday morning, Li De'er, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and American Director Mr. Smith, will depart Shanghai for Hong Kong on Sunday to confer with the Exchange Stabilization Fund in order to obtain more foreign exchange for Shanghai merchants to purchase essential goods. This is an unprecedented step that the Municipal Council will take to suppress and stabilize prices. It is reported that Li De'er and Mr. Smith will submit a detailed report on the foreign exchange needs of Shanghai importers to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The purpose of their consultation with the Fund is to achieve closer cooperation between the two parties on various foreign exchange matters related to Shanghai. To achieve this goal, the two will submit a detailed report to the Exchange Stabilization Fund describing the current situation here. Shanghai is expected to benefit greatly from this soon.</p>
<p>Increased Foreign Exchange Allocation, Improving Situation</p>
<p>The Exchange Stabilization Fund disclosed on [date missing] that it will provide greater foreign exchange facilitation for various imported goods into Shanghai, except for luxury goods. This is a sign that the trade, price, and exchange rate situation in Shanghai will improve. Yesterday, Reuters reported from Hong Kong that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will increase the foreign exchange allocated to Shanghai for the import of food and coal in November, which is a confirmation to the Shanghai business community that the Stabilization Fund has revised its policy. Qualified individuals here also said that the new liberal stance taken by the Exchange Stabilization Fund goes far beyond this. Coal merchants and banks all said on the surface that they had not received verifiable Reuters news, but in informal conversations, they all expected to receive confirmation "immediately." The impact of this development will likely benefit all aspects of citizens' lives.</p>
<p>Tense Situation Will Ease</p>
<p>Take coal as an example. The price of Zhao Nan coal has recently skyrocketed, rising by about 100 yuan per ton each week. It is also rumored that a major coal import company is considering closing down if it does not receive foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The municipal authorities are also unable to maintain the stability of coal prices. Now, Shanghai coal merchants will definitely be able to obtain foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund soon, so the coal problem will greatly ease. If factors such as freight can also be resolved, then the price of coal in Shanghai is expected to fall back to normal levels. The same is true for other various goods. According to explanations from people in the Shanghai financial community, the Exchange Stabilization Fund's granting of more liberal foreign exchange facilitation is not due to a policy change, but because its organization has been completely completed. In theory, the restrictive measures considered necessary to block foreign exchange loopholes are no longer needed. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has been meeting daily for the past three weeks and has paid considerable attention to the difficulties in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. [Name] Manages Rice, Wheat, and Coal</p>
<p>An authoritative source from the Shanghai Municipal Council also stated yesterday that the upcoming trip to Hong Kong by Chairman Li De'er and American Director Mr. Smith is the result of long-term research and discussion. Before the two decided to go to Hong Kong, they had already reached a principle agreement on which goods needed more foreign exchange. According to sources familiar with the matter, the goods that will be most impacted by the Municipal Council's implementation of price control plans are rice, wheat, and coal. Although rice has already been under control, in order to ensure continuous imports to stabilize prices, it is necessary to first obtain a definite guarantee on foreign exchange supply. Although the Municipal Council and the Exchange Stabilization Fund have been in contact regarding wheat and coal, there have been no concrete results. Therefore, Mr. Li and Mr. Smith will personally explain the situation to the Stabilization Fund authorities in Hong Kong. As for seasonings, decontamination materials, medicines, tobacco, soap, and pigments, the Municipal Council has also decided to control their prices, but their importance is significantly less than that of rice, coal, etc. The Municipal Council also hopes that citizens will wait patiently for news during this period and not easily believe rumors, so as not to give profiteers the opportunity to raise prices indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange for Films Shows Promise</p>
<p>The danger that Shanghai cinemas will be forced to close due to Western film distributors not receiving foreign exchange has almost disappeared. It is said that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will reclassify films from the "luxury goods" category to the "essential goods" category. According to sources, Mr. Hague, the representative of the Shanghai Western Film Merchants Association, has returned to Shanghai after talking to the Exchange Stabilization Fund in Hong Kong. This will ensure that Shanghai does not lose its films, which are a major source of entertainment. Those in charge also reported that the Exchange Stabilization Fund "has already allocated" foreign exchange for the import of films. It is said that after Mr. Hague presented everything in Hong Kong, the members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund believed that films should be reclassified into the "essential goods" category, but asked Mr. Hague to submit a written report explaining the reasons why foreign exchange should be allocated. Mr. Hague complied. The members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund are currently studying this report and have not yet formally responded to Mr. Hague, because American experts and Chinese representatives are all in Chongqing. The reporter asked Mr. Robateau, the chairman of the Western Film Merchants Association, about this matter, and Mr. Robateau replied, "It is quite optimistic."</p>
<p>Baker &amp; Co. Begins Registration</p>
<p>When Mr. Felippu, the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a speech at a reception for reporters the other day, he stated that an association of importers and manufacturers would be organized and that the British firm Baker &amp; Co., located at 17 The Bund in the Public Concession, would be entrusted to handle the registration. The Dazhong News Agency reporter specifically inquired about everything at the firm yesterday afternoon. It is said that although the firm has not yet received the various registration regulations issued by the authorities, Mr. Baker, the manager of the firm, has notified the company's staff to handle the registration of importers and manufacturers in Shanghai from yesterday. Baker &amp; Co., formerly known as Harmony Merchants, was established in 1847 and renamed Baker &amp; Co. in 1916. It has a history of 95 years. Its business scope is very wide. In addition to handling the import and export of various goods, it also serves as a liaison for various importers and manufacturers, so it has a close relationship with various industries in Shanghai. This time, it has been entrusted by the authorities to handle the registration of the Importers and Manufacturers Association, which should be able to complete it successfully. It is said that once the registration matters are completed, the authorities will convene a meeting to discuss further steps to prevent speculation and profiteering, and to suppress and stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Special Business Tax to be Levied; Investigation and Valuation</h3>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Public Concession has decided to levy a special tax on business premises from New Year's Day next year, and has hired valuation and investigation personnel to carry out the work. As the implementation date is approaching, the Bureau has decided to dispatch investigators from today to various districts in the central, northwestern, and eastern regions to conduct investigations in the alleys to clarify whether the houses are residential or business premises. Once the investigation is completed, it will be handed over to the valuation personnel to carry out the valuation in order to implement the collection of the special tax on schedule.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Establish Rice Sales Outlets; Citizens Can Purchase Directly; Those Willing to Sell Can Apply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that in order to ensure that the people of Shanghai can purchase rice directly from the Council at the Council's set price when they cannot purchase SMC rice from retail rice shops, it has decided to temporarily establish rice sales outlets in the central sections of both the north and south of the Suzhou Creek. Individuals or businesses willing to handle sales at these rice sales outlets as agents under the supervision of the Council can submit written applications to the Chief's Office of the Council. However, applicants must have experience in retailing rice in Shanghai, be familiar with the situation, and be able to provide sufficient staff to ensure that the agency matters can be properly carried out. When submitting the application, it is necessary to attach supporting documents and explain other important information. Applications must be submitted before November 5th; applications submitted after the deadline will not be considered.</p>
<h3>Postage Rates to Increase Today; Telegraph Fees to Hong Kong and Macau Also Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, by order of the Kunming Postal Headquarters, will increase postage rates for all mail sent abroad from today, whether airmail or printed parcels, heavy items, by 100%. The postage for each ordinary mail item weighing 20 grams will increase from 50 cents to 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Detailed Rates of the Postal Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office will publish a new price list in the near future. Postage for mail to all countries in the Postal Union, except Japan, Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the Kwangchowan Leased Territory, will increase by 100%. Each ordinary mail item weighing 20 grams or any fraction thereof will increase to 1 yuan. Each additional 20 grams or any fraction thereof will increase by 60 cents. Printed matter, newspapers, books, etc., will increase by 20 cents for every 50 grams. Samples and documents will be charged as printed matter, but commercial insurance documents, even if they weigh 250 grams, will be charged according to the prescribed unit. The registration fee will increase from 50 cents to 1 yuan, the express delivery fee will be 2 yuan, and the fee for a double-registered return receipt will be 1 yuan. A single postcard will be 60 cents, and a double postcard will be 1 yuan and 20 cents.</p>
<p>Airmail Rates</p>
<p>Airmail rates, including the existing Pan American Airways Clipper (RAA), foreign aircraft (JAL) on foreign routes, and the Dutch route, which are carried by the above-mentioned aircraft, will also increase simultaneously. For example, airmail to the United States weighing 5 grams, including ordinary postage, will cost 8 yuan and 50 cents. Airmail to South America and Central America will cost 14 yuan per 5 grams. Airmail to the UK, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and other European countries will increase to 20 yuan and 80 cents per 5 grams. Airmail to various places in the Philippines will cost 7 yuan and 80 cents per 5 grams. If registration or express delivery is required, a separate postage fee will be charged. Airmail to Bangkok, Saigon, Hanoi, and French Vietnam is currently carried by Japanese aircraft departing from Guangzhou. The Shanghai Post Office has already been accepting these items, and will also increase rates by 100% from today. The only difference is that the postage for the Shanghai-Guangzhou air route will not increase. Airmail to foreign countries can be sent via CNAC (i.e., ON.A.G) special flights from Chongqing to Yangon. The original rate was 25 cents per 5 grams, but this rate will be charged the same as domestic airmail and will not be increased.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Macau Telegraph Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daibei &amp; Pacific Telegraph Companies will increase the prices of all telegrams sent to Hong Kong and Macau from today. The price of ordinary telegrams to Hong Kong will be 1 yuan and 54 cents per word, code telegrams will be 93 cents per word, and Chinese code telegrams will be 77 cents per word. For telegrams to Macau, ordinary telegrams will be 1 yuan and 87 cents per word, code telegrams will be 1 yuan and 13 cents per word, and Chinese code telegrams will be 93 and a half cents per word, an increase of about 40% compared to the price increase in September.</p>
<h3>British Authorities Reissue Evacuation Order for Nationals: A Precautionary Measure</h3>
<p>The information counselor of the British Embassy reiterated the previous order the other day, urging British nationals to evacuate. This matter seems to have attracted considerable attention among some people. However, according to the Xin Sheng News Agency's inquiry from British officials, this reissued evacuation order is still limited to women and children and men who do not need to stay. Other British nationals will not evacuate due to temporary tensions. Currently, there are still more than 4,000 British nationals in Shanghai, of which one-fifth are women. Since the United States announced the evacuation of its nationals last autumn, British officials have also advised British nationals to evacuate, but with very little effect. This reiteration of the previous order is nothing more than a precautionary measure and should not be regarded as the United Kingdom abandoning Shanghai's commercial position and other interests. Currently, British nationals who evacuate have five destinations: Malaya, India, Burma, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Gas Stations to Suspend Supply on Sundays Starting Today</h3>
<p>It is understood that in order to reduce sales volume and ensure that existing gasoline can be maintained for a longer period of time, some major kerosene companies in Shanghai will close some gas stations every Sunday starting today. The Texaco Oil Company of Shanghai announced yesterday that from November 1st, all gas stations will stop supplying gasoline every Sunday, but the service of adding lubricating oil will not be stopped. Another oil company will take the same approach. Gas stations located outside the boundary will stop supplying gasoline on holidays. Oil distribution certificates for November have been distributed to customers by various oil companies, and customers are advised to comply with the oil consumption on the distribution certificates, as no further increases in supply will be considered except in special circumstances.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water Price Increase Today: 3 Cents Per Ladle; Ladle Size Relaxed</h3>
<p>The more than 540 boiled water shops (tiger stoves) in the city have barely been able to maintain their business since purchasing cheap coal ash. Although prices have risen and expenses have been huge, in order to take care of the four major social problems and the livelihoods of the common people, boiled water was still sold for 2 cents per ladle in national currency. Recently, the price of low-priced coal has also increased, and [shop owners] have successively sent letters to the Shanghai Boiled Water Shop Trade Association, requesting a reasonable increase in the price of hot water to maintain their capital. The association once dispatched two members, Zhang Delong and Li Jianming, to solicit opinions from the shop owners and convened a meeting to plan for good measures. However, due to a lack of resources and energy, it was finally resolved that from today, the price of boiled water will be temporarily increased by 1 cent in national currency. However, the association has produced 600 new copper ladles, which are slightly larger than the old ladles currently in use, and the volume will also be increased. The association has notified all fellow traders in the city to sell water at the agreed price and not to exceed it. Shop owners can claim new ladles from the association soon to unify the water sales.</p>
<h3>Low-Priced Foreign Rice: Another 20,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday; Hoping for Public Cooperation to Prevent Hoarding</h3>
<p>A large quantity of SMC's low-priced foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. As reported yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Hanyang wheel transported more than 20,000 bags of SMC low-priced rice from Hong Kong. It is now learned that the Jardine Matheson Company's Taisheng wheel arrived in port from Hong Kong yesterday, carrying 10,400 bags of SMC low-priced foreign rice. In addition, the company's Yongsheng wheel also arrived in port at 3:00 PM yesterday, also transporting 5,892 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were passengers and cargo, and were also unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. A large number are still arriving.</p>
<p>Expanded Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from the Shanghai Municipal Council that the Council has now decided to expand the sale of low-priced Hong Kong rice, selling each picul (160 catties) for 117 yuan in national currency. Large quantities of low-priced rice have been rushed here. All rice shops can register with the contracting foreign firm, and after being approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they can pay for the goods and sell them at the prescribed low price at their stores, so that the common people can purchase nearby and help alleviate the people's difficulties. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council sincerely hopes that all citizens will jointly prevent the hoarding of food rice. If anyone knows the inside story, they can report it directly to the nearest police station or the Municipal Council, so that personnel can be dispatched immediately for secret investigation. Once the investigation is confirmed, it will be dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Winter Relief</h3>
<p>The Sanjiao Daoyuan Charity Association has decided to start winter relief early from today, with the aim of distributing rice meals (each book of 50 tickets is sold for 10 yuan) and clothing (each item of 3.3 catties is sold for 13 yuan), so that charitable people can purchase and distribute them. The association also distributes them itself. Yesterday, various circles donated thousands of yuan to the winter relief fund. At the same time, it is also engaged in relief for orphans and widows, with a quota of 100 households. Registration has already begun, and once the investigation is completed, they will be given support separately. Various parties have heard the news and donated funds. As for the rice and clothing coupons, Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun coupon departments all sell them on behalf of the association.</p>
<h3>German Raider Supply Ship Repainted and Renamed</h3>
<p>The German Pacific Raider supply ship, flying the Japanese flag and calling itself the Japanese transport ship, arrived in Shanghai late at night on the 27th of last month and berthed at pontoons 6 and 7. The details were reported yesterday. It is now learned that the ship's body was originally light green, but it was suddenly repainted dark gray the other day, and the ship's name was written as "Tenjitsu Maru." Yesterday, it was still berthed at the original location and will soon leave Shanghai.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Officers All Receive a 20% Salary Increase</h3>
<p>The French Concession's Municipal Council believes that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai and the increase in the cost of living have made it difficult for the police officers of the various agencies under the Council to maintain their livelihoods. It has been resolved and announced yesterday to increase salaries by 20% across the board. The salary for last month has also been issued together with the additional increase. In short, the Council will increase the salaries of police officers of various agencies under its jurisdiction by 20% from October.</p>

<h3>Opening a Large-Scale Settlement to Accommodate 10,000 Beggars; Location Selected Near Zhenru; Construction to Begin Immediately After Approval</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday (30th), it was learned from responsible parties that a plan to establish another beggar reception center next to Zhongshan Road in the suburbs to accommodate 3,000 beggars has been drafted and is now awaiting approval from the authorities of the two concessions. It has been learned that the municipal authorities of the two concessions have recently jointly established a sub-committee with parties outside the boundary to negotiate a plan to first establish a beggar reception center in the suburbs and have resolved to begin construction and burial immediately after the plan is approved by the authorities.</p>
<p>Next to Zhongshan Road</p>
<p>The houses and land next to Zhongshan Road are allocated by the central district and are sufficient to accommodate the beggars of the two concessions. As for the large-scale beggar settlement, it will take some time to establish. Therefore, this initial plan is taken first. It has been learned that the beggar settlement will</p>
<p>Be Located in Zhenru</p>
<p>Covering 30 acres, it can be prepared to accommodate 10,000 beggars by next spring. According to someone closely related to the plan, after the large settlement is established, the houses next to Zhongshan Road will still be retained so that beggars can bathe, change clothes, and receive medical treatment there before entering the settlement. Now, we are only waiting for the municipal authorities to approve the plan and first send carpenters, tailors, and other skilled beggars to the reception center for training so that they can become the core of the settlement and help guide the remaining beggars to engage in handicrafts next spring when the settlement accommodates all the beggars in Shanghai. A senior official of the Municipal Council said that the Council hopes that this plan will be realized as soon as possible. The work of eliminating beggars on the streets of Shanghai is an important part of the Relief Association's responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Tongshunxiang Rice Shop Thrown a Bomb; Thrower Apprehended</h3>
<p>Tongshunxiang Rice Shop at 426 Rue Foch, French Concession, is opened by Zhou Zirong (36 years old), a local. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a man wearing yellow clothes suddenly went to the front of the shop and threw an object wrapped in newspaper. It made a sound when it landed, and the man turned and ran away. The shop assistants followed and caught the man. The people in the shop opened the package and were horrified to find a small hand grenade. Fortunately, it did not explode. They immediately whistled to arrest the bomb thrower and brought him to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Chen Shenggen, 26 years old, from Longhua, Xixiang. He was instructed to throw the bomb to scare and extort money. The police chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation and prosecution. Meanwhile, a detective was sent to the rice shop to take the bomb back to the police station for destruction.</p>

<h3>Gang Den Smashed in Nanshi; Two Hostages Rescued; One Named Li Shu, One Named Zhao Zhaolian; Gang Members Caught in One Sweep; Car Confiscated According to a secret report from the Xinzha Police Station based on a clue, a large number of Chinese and Western police officers were dispatched together with Japanese military police to Liu Baojia's home at 175 Qiaojia Road, Nanshi, to rescue a hostage named Li Shuchun, and the suspects Pan Jirong, Hu Qingquan, Liu Quan, etc. and Liu Baojia were arrested and detained in the military police team. According to Liu's confession, [police] went to 178 Jiangyin Street, Nanshi,</h3>
<p>to rescue hostage</p>
<p>Zhao Zhaolian. According to Liu's confession, [police] continued to Yinghua Street, Datong Hotel No. 235, and arrested 5 accomplices, Sha Zaien, Chen Zheping, Yi Songgang, Bao Chongzheng, Yu Yongde, etc. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin represented the court to state the case, saying that the defendant Sha Zaien was previously a Chinese police officer No. 14 in the Shanghai Municipal Council, but was dismissed for dereliction of duty. He then colluded with the defendants and the detained civil servant Liu Baojia in Nanshi to commit illegal acts. On the evening of the 15th of this month at about 8 PM, [Sha Zaien] and Liu, etc.</p>
<p>drove a car</p>
<p>with two Japanese people to Nanyang Coal Ball Factory No. 1028 on Tokyo Road, falsely claiming to have been sent by the Japanese headquarters to discuss matters with the factory director. When Li Shuchun, an official of the material transportation section, came out to meet [the group], [Li Shuchun] was dragged into the car and driven to Nanshi, where he was hidden in Liu Baojia's home. After the police station was informed and solved the case the other day, according to the confession, [police] rescued the employee of Baolong Foreign Company Zhao Zhaolian (who lives at Lane 15, 345 Meibaige Road, and was kidnapped on the evening of the 25th of this month at 9:00 PM) on Jiangyin Street and seized a Mauser gun, 7 bullets, and</p>
<p>a pair of handcuffs.</p>
<p>Finally, after Sha Zaien was arrested at Datong Hotel, [police] seized two pieces of lead plate for manufacturing fake car permits, and [police] went to Guangxi Road and seized car No. 10488, which was used in the kidnapping case. Because the defendants have committed numerous crimes and Liu Baojia is still detained in Nanshi, the procedures for transferring custody have not been completed. It is requested that the hearing be postponed. Judge Zhong, after reviewing the case, briefly questioned the defendants about their ages and then ordered them to be returned to custody. The hearing was rescheduled to November 15th.</p>

Fortunately, the traffic regulator No. 1101 guarding the alley noticed it and immediately took steps to move the hand grenade to the side of the road. After the French police station was informed, it dispatched a police car to the address to take the hand grenade back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Dr. Zhu Chunting Begins Practice</h3>
<p>What Western medicine calls "Maggage" is actually the Chinese "Tuina" massage. It has miraculous effects in treating arthritis and various nerve-related ailments. The medical sage Hippocrates is said to have remarked that those studying medicine should also learn Maggage, indicating its importance. The art of Tuina in China originated in ancient times. The Yellow Emperor had a "Massage Classic," but unfortunately, the upper volume has been lost. This art is easy to learn but difficult to master. It requires guiding "qi" to penetrate the fingertips, and only with strong fingers can one guide the body's "qi" and blood, ensuring they flow unhindered, thereby eliminating all ailments. Zhu Chunting of Jiading is a student of the renowned Ding Fengshan. He is highly skilled in this art and has now opened his practice at Lane 73, Huanlong Road. Patients are flocking to him. For ailments such as numbness in the limbs, there's no need to take medicine; his touch brings miraculous recovery.</p>

<h3>Women's Shoe Industry Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Workers in the city's women's shoe industry, facing a threat to their livelihood, demanded a wage increase from management but were unsuccessful. A strike began on the 25th of last month.

<h3>Shanghai Prostitutes (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ke Qun</p>
<p>In these cheap brothels, each prostitute must entertain twenty-five customers every night. Although foreigners who visit them try to maintain some degree of hygiene, the fact is that, according to doctors, at least one-third of the customers contract venereal diseases because they do not take preventive measures beforehand.</p>
<p>From my investigation among the prostitutes in these brothels, I learned that most of them come from the countryside. They are not dissatisfied with their current fate, mainly because it is easier to live in the city than in the countryside. Upon closer analysis, most of these women were sold into prostitution by their impoverished parents. Many were pawned into brothels to work as prostitutes for several years. A few were abducted from the countryside and sold into brothels by criminals.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there exists a sinful profession: trading in young women. Many brokers are scattered throughout the countryside, specializing in buying, pawning, and even abducting women. On the other hand, they also deal in the buying and selling of prostitutes. If their "quality" deteriorates – if they contract venereal diseases or their beauty fades – they are often sold by one brothel to another. However, this is not unique to Shanghai. Many other countries still have this profession to this day. We cannot condemn them for the existence of this sin and disease in Shanghai – neither those who engage in human trafficking, nor the prostitutes, nor the police. It is Shanghai itself that needs the existence of prostitutes, and these women do not feel unhappy. I remember once when I visited a brothel, I heard someone ask: "Why haven't the giant ships of England and America come to Shanghai yet!" What is the reason?</p>
<p>Only a dozen or so high-class brothels in the Public Concession are regularly inspected by doctors; the rest are not. Prostitution is illegal in the Public Concession, but prostitutes are still widespread everywhere. In the French Concession, prostitutes must register. Prostitutes in the French Concession must comply with regulations and undergo medical examinations. However, this does not mean that all prostitutes in the French Concession are clean and disease-free. On the contrary, according to a doctor, the prevalence of venereal diseases in the French Concession is just as common as in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>When prostitutes in the French Concession contract diseases, the authorities can give them a few medical injections, but they are not treated. If they were to be treated, they would have to stop working for several weeks or months, which they cannot afford. Medical injections only remove the external symptoms of the disease. The internal condition remains the same. Therefore, whether they receive medical injections or not, there is no difference in their transmission of the disease to the public. Even if prostitutes have diseases, the brothel owners will not allow them to stop working. If all the prostitutes in the French Concession were given actual treatment, the medical expenses would be enormous. Moreover, this disease continues to flow from the Public Concession into the French Concession!</p>
<p>In the low-class brothels that the reporter observed, I have never seen any of the women pay attention to modern hygiene methods. Several women have also become addicted to drugs. However, most prostitutes never come into contact with narcotics until they have spent several years in this profession. Those who are too addicted to drugs will be expelled from the brothel, left to roam the streets, or resold to even lower-class brothels. Prostitutes who have worked in brothels for several years are sure to be completely infected with diseases. Although they may receive occasional medical injections, they still cannot change the appearance of their illness. At this time, their fate is either expulsion or being sent back to their hometown. If she is expelled, she will start selling sex on the streets, spreading the diseases she has contracted to the lower classes of the city. If she is sent back to her hometown, she will marry someone, and the diseases she has contracted will be passed on to her future children.</p>

<h3>More Than Three Years; Current Education Situation in Anhui Province (1) Registering Unemployed and Out-of-School Students; Adjusting and Strengthening Schools at All Levels</h3>
<p>(Lihuang News) Since the incident, education in Anhui has been divided into three stages. During the period from the "July 7th" Incident to 1938, schools at all levels in Anhui suffered damage and were mostly suspended. In 1939, the Education Department, under extremely difficult human and material conditions, engaged in registering unemployed and out-of-school students and restoring schools at all levels. In 1940, on the one hand, it re-adjusted and strengthened the schools that had been restored and established, and on the other hand, it sought to expand the functions of school education, urging schools at all levels to also handle social education, and actively planned to establish a university or college above the specialized level. The current situation of education since the struggle is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Elementary Education (1) Establishing Temporary Elementary Schools. There were originally 33 elementary schools in Anhui Province, but they were all suspended due to the impact of the war. Starting in 1939, the Education Department planned to establish 28 temporary elementary schools. In 1940, another ten schools were added, for a total of 38 provincial temporary elementary schools, with 241 classes, 390 faculty and staff, and 10,665 students. (2) Restoring General Elementary Schools and Short-Term Elementary Schools and Establishing Township and Bao Elementary Schools. There were originally 3,793 county, district, and private elementary schools and 3,800 short-term elementary schools in Anhui Province. In 1938, the Japanese army invaded Jianghuai, causing much destruction. In the spring of 1939, the Education Department urgently sought to restore them, resuming classes in 2,038 general elementary schools and 1,517 short-term elementary schools. In April of the same year, according to the principle of the integration of political education and health in Anhui Province, all original general elementary schools and short-term elementary schools were changed to township and bao elementary schools. According to the statistics reported by the counties, as of the end of 1939, there were a total of 131 township elementary schools and 2,865 bao elementary schools in the province, totaling 4,067 schools, with 5,843 classes, 8,910 faculty and staff, 172,000 students, and expenses of 85,165 yuan. In 1940, the Education Department continued to order counties to raise funds according to the original plan. According to statistics, the counties in Anhui Province had established 522 township elementary schools and four bao elementary schools in the first semester of 1940, an increase of 311 township elementary schools and 1,331 bao elementary schools compared to 1939. Currently, there are 2,723 township schools and 7,035 bao schools in the province. (3) Implementing Education for Orphans. Anhui Province is located in the rear of the Japanese army, and after the catastrophe, many children who suffered were displaced. In the spring of 1939, the Education and Youth Department ordered all temporary elementary schools to accept as many refugee children as possible, providing them with books, uniforms, board, and lodging.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Children in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiansan</p>
<p>According to my investigation, the total number of overseas Chinese children in the Southeast Asian islands is approximately 900,000. Thailand has the most, with 320,000; British Malaya is second, with 200,000. The Dutch East Indies has 180,000, French Annam has 70,000, and American Philippines has the least, with only 50,000.</p>
<p>These little "Babas" and "Nyonyas" who grow up overseas mostly develop very quickly because of the perennial spring-like climate of Southeast Asia. By the time they are fourteen or fifteen years old, they already have a strong physique and a broad chest, looking like a burly man. Anyone who sees their healthy physique must applaud them, which is incomparable to children who grow up in China.</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese children are like little angels. They are mostly intelligent, lively, and lovely. However, the hot climate of the equator affects the development of their brains. If they are older, their thinking and memory gradually become dull, and they gradually become foolish. Therefore, they are most unsuitable for learning the rigorous and meticulous sciences. Even a simple math problem of "479 × 368 = ?" often results in an eleven or twelve-year-old overseas Chinese elementary school student getting beaten several times by the teacher with a rattan cane. Their nature is more fond of art, music, sports, and other kinds of things. When they grow up, they often have great achievements. In addition, because they have always lived in foreign lands, they are also very proficient in foreign languages such as English, French, Dutch, and Malay. However, even if they study Chinese for ten or eight years, it is still like facing a Zhang Er Monk: unable to figure it out. This is due to the environment.</p>
<p>When they reach the age of five or six, they are mostly sent to overseas Chinese elementary schools. Their families are mostly well-off, at least middle-class families who do not worry about food and clothing. They have food to eat, things to play with, and books to read. They are happy! However, their smoggy family environment is their greatest misfortune. Their parents are mostly uneducated industrial and commercial classes, with very outdated minds. Therefore, they still use ancient methods to raise their children, which are absurd and inappropriate, to say the least. I say: We should open up that narrow path and let them go to another new world!</p>
<p>Their personalities are just like little monkeys. They are mostly active and dislike being quiet. They can spend the whole day running and jumping outside, such as playing ball, swimming, and climbing mountains, but they are unwilling to sit on a chair for three or two hours to read a thin collection of fairy tales. Their hearts are mostly straightforward and full of emotions. If you tell them a little about the history of China being invaded, it will cause them to clench their small fists and show righteous indignation. If one of their teachers is about to leave them, it will earn them countless innocent tears, like parting from family.</p>
<p>Finally, I must write in bold that the patriotism of these overseas Chinese children is very active. As far as I know, in various parts of Southeast Asia, they gather in groups of three or five after school, carrying a donation iron can on their backs, running five or ten miles, braving the scorching sun in the sky, to beg for relief for their suffering motherland. Over the years, at least one-quarter of the large donations from overseas Chinese to their motherland have been earned by them with their small throats, their sweaty faces, and their passionate patriotism. Lovely little angels!</p>

<h3>Eight Great Advisors of President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>— 義道</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt has eight great advisors who meet with him every evening to discuss strategies, report on news from various sectors, and identify and recommend talented individuals. President Roosevelt relies on them as his right and left hands. Below are sketches of these eight advisors:</p>
<p>(1)麥蘭脫 (Mai Lan Tuo)—The current Director of the Government Information Office, possessing strong decisiveness, is therefore deeply trusted by Roosevelt. Mai Lan Tuo previously served as a war correspondent and editor for Howard for many years, so he is very familiar with the ins and outs of the press. During his time as an editor, he wrote articles strongly criticizing the policy of subjecting news to censorship and control. Since becoming the Director of the Information Office, he has visited the White House almost every day to meet with President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>(2) 肖武 (Xiao Wu)—A famous playwright who has written scripts such as "Lincoln" and "Earth and Heaven," which have all been adapted into movies by Hollywood. Xiao Wu is tall and thin, but his enthusiasm and perseverance for work exceed ordinary people. He often drafts speeches for President Roosevelt overnight, not relaxing until they are completed.</p>
<p>(3) 伯力脫 (Bo Li Tuo)—Beautiful and charismatic, she was formerly the U.S. Ambassador to France. During the outbreak of the great war, Bo Li Tuo held almost daily long-distance telephone conversations with Roosevelt across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>(4) 羅純孟 (Luo Chun Meng)—The current Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court. He is busiest when Roosevelt is preparing to deliver his Fireside Chats. Luo Chun Meng possesses an incredible talent for interspersing humorous and insightful short sentences in speeches, adding a lot of color to the entire address. Luo Chun Meng has edited five major government documents for Roosevelt and can be called President Roosevelt's personal editor.</p>
<p>(5) 奧康諾 (Ao Kang Nuo)—When Roosevelt was practicing law, Ao Kang Nuo served as his assistant lawyer. His younger brother lost the election in 1938 due to Roosevelt's victory, but Ao Kang Nuo's friendship with Roosevelt did not cool down because of this. He is currently the President of the National Institute for Infantile Paralysis.</p>
<p>(6) 弗蘭克夫特 (Fu Lan Ke Fu Te)—It is said that the number of officials recommended by 弗蘭克夫特 is greater than the number personally identified and selected by President Roosevelt. He is erudite and versatile and is essentially Roosevelt's walking encyclopedia.</p>
<p>(7) 克利許 (Ke Li Xu)—The current Librarian of the House of Representatives. His familiarity with the history of various countries has won him Roosevelt's favor.</p>
<p>(8) 伯路起 (Bo Lu Qi)—伯路起 visits the White House every Tuesday to have lunch with Roosevelt and gives a detailed report on the national defense program after the meal. 伯路起 served as the Minister of War Industries from 1917 to 1918, so he has rich experience in wartime production.</p>
<h3>The Real Value of Life</h3>
<p>— 非了</p>
<p>Some days ago, a large advertisement for "China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory" was published in the newspaper, with this passage in the middle:</p>
<p>"We manufacture, not remodel: we seek quality, not low prices."</p>
<p>I can't help but nod in agreement, because this is a positive philosophy of life!</p>
<p>Many people think that life is about remodeling, utilizing, making roses more vibrant, and apples bigger.</p>
<p>Many people also think that life is about being opportunistic, economical, bypassing high mountains, and climbing small hills.</p>
<p>This is 100% wrong! A positive life is about manufacturing, inventing. A positive life is about rules and values. Scientists will tell you:</p>
<p>"Many times, I wanted to use a certain piece of knowledge, advocate it, and find a shortcut, but in the end, I ended up going around in circles. I realized that invention relies on self-discovery!"</p>
<p>Experienced businessmen tell you, "I can run an 'old shop,' I can also run a new shop, but I can't run a 'newly reopened old shop.'"</p>
<p>"Yes, silk stockings are discounted," but beware, they will come undone in two weeks. A professor with a white beard will tell you:</p>
<p>"If you want to learn French, it's best to forget English, because every language has its independence."</p>
<p>If you go to church, the pastor will also tell you:</p>
<p>"Christ does not repair the world, but gives the world a demolition and a building."</p>
<p>We have already seen enough, we are making bread, not cutting toast. Everything has to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>"Life is a mystery, a dream," that's just idle work by poets! Underestimating yourself proves that you are "not of good quality": we need a life of real value! No defective goods! No discounts!</p>
<h3>Rubber Made From Gasoline</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>Recently, someone in the United States invented a method of directly producing artificial rubber from gasoline. This is indeed very beneficial to the United States, as it allows them to no longer rely on foreign supplies of this important raw material. This type of newly invented artificial rubber looks very peculiar and interesting. Some people are already using it to manufacture tires and other items. Due to differences in raw materials and properties, the United States also has several other types of artificial rubber. Therefore, national defense experts can choose the rubber with the most suitable properties for manufacturing the desired items at will.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>Fourteen Dozen Heroes' Life</p>
<p>The man named Qian, after listening to his long and strange theory, couldn't think of anything to refute him for a moment.</p>
<p>Just then, Xiao Jiqing walked back smilingly.</p>
<p>"Boss Wu, we absolutely can't do it here; because, Brother Qian, as you know," he said, while constantly scanning Qian and Wu's faces with his eyes, "since the fighting started in Zhabei, the market has been terrible. Of the four major theaters in Shanghai, three have closed down in less than two months. Now only we are barely managing. But because of this, there are so many people backstage and in front of the stage, people who stopped working elsewhere are coming to me for a way out. Now there's no need to mention these things! Since it's Mr. Qian's face, as long as Boss Wu doesn't mind being treated unfairly, then there are two opportunities now, it's up to you to choose!"</p>
<p>Two opportunities came at once, which Begonia really didn't expect. Even Qian Ruomo almost dropped half of his cigar from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Then may I ask what those two occupations are?" Autumn Begonia asked in a low voice. (251)</p>

<h3>Examination and Impressions</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The "Fun Quiz" published on Double Ten Day was enthusiastically participated in by readers, and the letters of application poured in like snowflakes. Within the five-day deadline, a total of 7,534 pieces were received, which can be described as colorful, dazzling, and overwhelming. We started reviewing them on the 20th, and asked four colleagues to help open the envelopes. We first made a statistics of the occupations of the applicants, the results of which were 36% business, 24% academic, 12% labor, and 28% other. It was then decided that the selection would be divided into three steps: preliminary selection, re-selection, and final selection, with me being responsible for grading.</p>
<p>The preliminary selection was divided into two categories, A and B. The emphasis was on the first question. Those who answered with a similar number of days for the initial release period were selected, totaling 1,672 people, while 5,862 were eliminated, averaging less than one-fifth. The re-selection was divided into four categories, A, B, C, and D. The first and second questions were given equal weight, that is, those who got both the Chinese and foreign film initial release periods correct and matched all sixteen couples correctly were ranked A; those who got half of the initial release periods correct and matched the couples correctly were ranked B; those who were slightly off on the number of days but matched the couples correctly were ranked C; and those who were slightly off on both the number of days and the couple matching were ranked D. As a result, 89 people were ranked A, and 95 were ranked B, but the quota was only 100 people, so categories C and D were discarded, and a final selection process was carried out on the 179 people in categories A and B. Since it was called a final selection, it was of course necessary to be extra careful. It was still divided into four categories, A, B, C, and D, and 100 people were selected from the 179 people to finalize the results. The criteria were as follows: (1) those who got both questions correct, wrote neatly, and cut and pasted according to the format were ranked A, totaling ten people; (2) those who got both questions correct, cut and pasted according to the format, but whose writing was not neat were ranked B, totaling twenty people; (3) those who were slightly off on both questions but whose writing was neat were ranked C, totaling thirty people; (4) the remaining forty were ranked D. The total number was exactly 100 people. Looking at the more than 7,000 application papers, I felt that there were several common drawbacks, which was regrettable! For example, the writing was sloppy and blurred, the cutting and pasting was either too large or too small, and the specified format was not followed, resulting in uneven and messy papers, losing their beauty. Finally, the 100 selected papers were trimmed, neatly bound, and put into order. This is the most easily overlooked aspect by most people, and it is the starting point for everything being off track. As the ancients said, "Without rules, there can be no circles or squares." In order to correct these habits, I cannot help but make a slightly demanding criticism here. I hope the readers will forgive me.</p>
<p>In addition, the China United Film Company and the Renhua Grand Theater both sent letters to certify the start and end dates of the initial release of "Mulan Joins the Army" and "Gone with the Wind," which gave me a guideline and I am very grateful. Due to the limited number of places, they also express their apologies to the majority of unsuccessful applicants!</p>
<h3>Qilin Tong to Perform a Short Engagement</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>After Shifting Customs Society’s Qilin Tong discontinued performing Bian Er Deng, half a year will soon pass. It was once widely rumored he would perform at the Great Shanghai Theater, but that was proven to be only a speculation by those who admire Qilin's art. Now, according to reliable sources, the Golden Grand Theater will invite Qilin Tong for a short engagement. If negotiations are successful, then he will immediately follow Meng Xiaodong's engagement. Given the Golden Theater’s resources in hiring northern actors, it is expected that Qilin Tong will accept even if he has relatively extravagant demands.</p>

<h3>Blood-Rain Qiong Hua</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Vow to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of Personal Safety</p>
<p>San Gui read it once, then said to the envoy Xian Ting: "You wrote this letter very well. I have no choice but to beg for troops. After defeating the rebel, we can discuss matters further." He then sent Vice-General Yang Kun and Guerrilla General Guo Yunlong to deliver the letter and beg for troops. At that time, the Qing Dynasty's Regent Dorgon was leading the army as Grand General, seizing territory outside the Pass. Upon receiving Wu Sangui's letter begging for troops, he discussed with his civil and military officials whether or not to send troops to aid the Ming. Several civil officials, such as Grand Scholar Fan Wencheng, advocated denouncing the rebels and punishing the bandits, answering Sangui's request. "Troops move with righteousness, what achievement cannot be accomplished?" Dorgon himself also thought this was a good opportunity not to be missed, so he immediately wrote back to Sangui, agreeing to send troops. The letter contained phrases such as "In the past, Guan Zhong shot Duke Huan in the hook, but later Duke Huan used him as his minister, achieving hegemony. Now, if Bo Ruo leads his troops to return, he will surely be enfeoffed with his former territory and promoted to a princely rank, so that national revenge can be avenged and personal safety can be ensured." Thus, Dorgon's intentions can be imagined. After San Gui received Dorgon's reply, he sent another letter urging them to advance troops. This matter had already spread throughout the army. Zhang Cangqiu, upon hearing the news of the request for Qing troops, hurriedly went to see Xu Liu and Chen Fei, and they all gathered together for a discussion. Zhang Cangqiu spoke first, "You probably already know about General Wu's request for Qing troops. I don't think so at all. They are our dynasty's hereditary enemies, with the ambition of wolves – unpredictable. Our dynasty should strengthen its defenses to prevent Jianling. How can we ask them for troops to help us attack the rebels? This is no different from leading a wolf into the house, opening the door to invite thieves. What wisdom does General Wu have? Whoever advised General Wu to make this plan should have their head cut off! I must go see General Wu and advise him not to borrow Qing troops and bring enemies into the pass." (207)</p>
