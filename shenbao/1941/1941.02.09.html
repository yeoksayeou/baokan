<p>社評</p>
<h3>從義軍屢敗說起</h3>
<p>義大利在巴爾幹作戰不利，在地中海方面澤遭封鎖，在北非東非又無往而不吃敗仗；其陸軍似乎經不起大戰，前方統帥一再更調乃至三調四調；凡此所暴露的，眞是弱點重重。至於空軍，雖自命不凡，實際也毫無建樹，開戰未久，義國空軍元勛巴爾波上將即在神秘情形之下，一墜機而死」；降至今日，竟連堂堂外交部長也出任轟炸機隊長，想見其人材缺乏。海軍允爲不濟，八閱月來，非獨無聲無臭，不敢出戰，甚至躱藏泰蘭吐港內，亦被英方炸毀過半。最近阿爾巴尼亞境內戰局，雖較過去穩定了些，但亦未聞其乘希臘總理梅達克薩斯突然逝世的機會，有何特殊戰績，反而在號稱經營多年的北非與東非方面，一敗再敗；不但西里尼加首府班加齊港已繼杜勃魯克台爾納兩地之後而告陷落，即伊里特里亞和義屬索謀里蘭境內，亦復相繼告急；而征服了數年的阿比西尼亞，一方既處於英軍和南非軍自南北兩面夾攻之下，一方更受阿皇塞拉西奔走復國的嚴重威脅。照這幾天非洲戰局全盤形勢看來，的確應了一昨若干英國軍事專家的推測，使人懷疑黑衫軍在歸路被截的恐慌之下，或有全部放棄非洲陣地的可能。</p>
<p>當然，此際武斷義大利已經戰敗，似乎尚嫌過早，允其是聰明的希特勒早已一方反客爲主地，「借用」義國的空軍根據地，一方派遣許多「專家」到義國去「幫忙」，在這種變相的監視之下，除非義大利民族發生革命，若謂墨索里尼統治下的羅馬政府將因軍事敗衂，而首先「求和一，似乎還是不可想像的事。不過，就英國的角度來觀察，却不難明明白白地看出：倫敦政府在本部三島方面，固然取的是守勢，準備着應付德軍的登陸或大舉空襲；但在地中海方面，的確取的是攻勢，大有迅速殲滅義國全部作戰力，使羅馬首先「屈服的雄心。</p>
<p>本來，英國目下所進行之對軸心戰爭，在北海和大西洋方面，既因法國的休戰而無法再作進攻大陸的企圖，她爲爭取主動地位起見，惟有轉在地中海沿岸，向軸心中較弱的一環——義大利進攻。假使英國竟得把義國戰敗，不僅將因消極地拆散了軸心陣綫，而减少對德作戰的牽掣，更可積極地取得許多實際利益，而可能縮短最後制勝的途程。</p>
<p>第一，義國如果屈服，其一部份海軍實力或可移轉至英國手中，這樣，倫敦政府不獨可自地中海艦隊抽調多數軍艦，在北海和大西洋上對抗德國，甚至還可騰出一部份實力，以加强遠東艦隊，從而壓制日本對於南洋的蠢動。</p>
<p>第二，義國如果屈服，地中海便名符其實地成了「英國湖」，倘使法蘭西和西班牙兩國的艦隊繼續保持中立，英國的商船便可在地中海上暢行無阻，而遠東與印度航綫，也將因不必繞道好望角而縮短過半；航綫的短縮與維持，當然不僅是商業上的價値。</p>
<p>第三，在戰略方面言之，地中海倘完全爲英國所控制，那麽還繞地中海海四周各股的態度必然發生重大變更，據紐約民聲講壇報軍事記者艾黎沃特少校的估計，不但西班牙將更加「親英」，北非洲法國全部屬地將更加擁護貝當，以反抗德國的苛求；甚至巴爾幹方面也將受到影響，而使東南歐各國今後更可堅決對付軸心的壓力，而叙利亞一隅更將純粹成爲英國與土耳其兩國的勢力範圍。＝</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見英國倘能首先擊敗義大利，便能得到上述的種種益處。換句話說，義國如敗，希特勒便須感受上述的種種不利，此所以他在對於義希戰事觀望兩個多月之後，終於不得不變更方針，採取積極援義的行動。他的第一步驟，便是自德國空軍中抽調一部份實力，利用義國的根據地，以直接打擊地中海上的英國艦隊和商船；這一點，的確是英國地中海艦隊所不予忽視的。誠如美國史蒂林海軍少將一昨所稱，一個艦隊倘在敵方空軍根據地附近活動，而沒有充分的空軍實力加以保護，簡直成了敵機的「愴靶」，不免要受到莫大的困擾；因此之故，英國空軍此際之需要大量補充，確已到了「急如星火」的階段。至於希特勒這幾天之所以加緊壓迫維希政府，企圖取得法國殘餘艦隊並使用她的港口，正可以說明他是如何切望在地中海方面挽救義國的頹勢；因爲倘能利用法義兩國的艦隊，配合德義兩國的空軍更以法義兩國的港口爲根據地，希特勒對於爭奪地中海上的制空權和制海權，的確可和英國一較短長的。</p>
<p>德國在地中海方面加緊行動的時候，仍可隨時在英倫海峽或巴爾幹半島發動攻勢，以收牽掣之效，這是母庸疑惑的，在這軸心國必須最後挣扎，各方戰局行見擴大的前夕，全世界人士的視綫不禁要集中於舉足輕重的美國，因爲今後華盛頓政府究將如何積極援助英國，以制機先，確已成爲歐非戰局甚至遠東時局未來演變的轉捩點。</p>

<p>歐戰業談　（廿）（三）</p>
<h3>美國外交上的秘聞</h3>
<p>局勢瞬息萬變。四月五日，義大利動員軍隊，侵人阿爾巴尼亞，兩天內佔領全境。德軍開始勳員，英法深恐穗國乘其不備，先發制人。到了四月十一日，義大利徵召一九一〇年及一九四年兩級士兵入伍，德軍七師集中波蘭邊境。至此，歐局悲觀達於極點。</p>
<p>總統仍如往常一般，在大西洋電話中詢問駐歐洲各國大使，有無挽救的方法，各大使照舊回答「非有相當動作，難於挽回，」而任何動作又非美國當時與情所可贊同。但總統絕不氣餒，仍抱萬一之圖，想用私人名義，致電希特勒和墨索里尼，請其保證不攻他國。</p>
<p>電文到十三日方始擬妥。决日，總統和赫爾及威爾斯兩人，又把電文細讀一過。赫爾以爲拍發的時機尚未成熟，但總統不願坐失時機，逕命分發羅馬柏林兩處。總統原望這一决的呼籲可以獲得一勞永逸的結果，至少也可以獲得滿意的結果。殊知事實適得其反。墨索里尼和希特勒暫時沉默之後，就用演說方式，先後加以答復。事後，總統並召見義國大使科洛那，用溫和而確定的語氣告訴他說，墨索里尼不用書面答復，有失國際禮貌。國務院也向德國代辦湯姆遜表示同樣的遺憾。（未完）</p>
<p>一九三九年四月中旬，歐局危機益緊。羅斯福總統和赫爾鄭重的從長計議應付辦法。總統對於英法當局的放棄妥協政策。仍不無疑慮。赫爾則已較爲確定，相信戰爭爆發的危險性，較總統允甚，相信廢軍火禁止令，可以增加和平的機會。總統經過縝密考慮之後，表示同意。於是兩人開始勸告參衆兩院態度游移的議員。</p>
<p>他們白費許多脣舌，結果只有失望。衆議院外交委員會在六月杪某日深夜通過一個等於吾決的修正案，參議院外交委員會則於七月十一日以十二對十一票表決，將廢止軍火禁止出口案擱　不提。</p>
<p>形勢雖是如此不利，總統和赫爾仍不氣餒，決定召集各重要參議員，在白宮舉行會議，討論補救辦法。總統照例向他們說明戰爭的危機，爲廢止軍火禁令作一套辯護。各參議員足足聽了一個鐘頭，末了，總統表示他對於斡旋和平已瀕智窮力竭之境，因而說道，「這是我最後一策。此後我只好另起爐灶了。」「總統先生，」參院共和黨領袖麥克那萊揷嘴說，「你以爲從此刻到國會下屆例會期間，戰爭一定會發作嗎？」「我並不是說一定會發作，」總統回答說，「但我確信有極大的可能性。」</p>
<p>赫爾繼起發言，謂戰事當在夏末秋初發作，廢止軍火禁令一舉，至少可把戰爭的危機，减去一半。美國和此决戰爭關係重大。他愈說愈奮激，感情一發不可退制。起初還沒人有打斷他的話頭，到後來孤立派領袖以反對美國加入國聯會聞名的老將波拉，畢竟忍耐不住了，就放出他一套理論來。</p>
<p>「來日如何，無人可以逆料，」他打斷赫爾的話道，「但依我所見，我們不會遇着什麽戰爭。德國也並不準備作戰」</p>
<p>一我希望貴議員到我辦公廳來，讀一讀海外發來的電報，」赫爾用一種憂愁而帶耐性的口氣回答說。「我可以斷定，屆時他的結論，一定會承認戰爭的危險性，遠非他想像所及。」</p>
<p>「國務院裹的報告如何，我不管，」波拉堅決地回答說。「我自有我的情報，且有好幾次，我發現我自己的情報，比較國務院方面的可靠得多哩。」</p>
<p>波拉說出這句驚人的話後，全堂頓時寂然。赫爾眼眶裏禁不住消下熱淚。有人再向赫爾問詢意見時，他慘然地說，他在領敎過波拉的一番議論，不能再有什麼發揮了。幸而副總統賈納一向是樂觀派，就出來打圓塲。總統呢，靠在沙發裏吸捲烟，他自始即料到這塲會議沒有什麼好結果，儘管赫爾悲傷，他仍舊心平氣和答覆賈納說，他已竭盡所能，此刻須由參議院負其責任。波拉也插嘴說，這事「並無什麼困難」，會議就此草草終塲。（未完）</p>

<h3>經濟業譚  馮柳堂</h3>
<p>上元燈市</p>
<p>燈市，　來筆記者中不少見；至談燈市之由來，未之多覯；茲所談，即欲就此稍事推究耳！</p>
<p>上元燈節，由來已久，蓋出於方士者流；大抵形成於唐盛於宋，相沿迄今耳！道敎以正月十五日爲上元，七月十五日爲中元，十月十五日爲下元。而以三官上帝主上中下三元；三官者，天官地官水官也。何以燈市形成於店，此則非謂唐以前無掛燈之事也。李白所謂「古人秉燭夜遊，良有以也。」秉燭者，設無燈以籠之，火易滅，即不能作夜遊，故知必用燈。旣持燈以夜遊，則於夜間張燈以作樂，亦尋常之舉耳。再進而求張燈之美術化，造成形形色色之花燈，亦爲事實所應有。店承六朝之後，又硬拉老　作遠祖，於是道家之說盛行。道家以三官能爲人間降福，而三元觀燈之舉，遂爲大規模張燈之由來。再經君主提倡於上，人民風靡於下，爭奇鬥勝，花樣百出，以求一日之長，亦人情所恒有，於是有花燈。花燈不易製，有求之者，有製售之者，即燈市之所由起也。</p>
<p>何以知店代燈市已形成，此則觀於中宗景龍四年正月丙寅丁卯二日，兩决偕韋后微行觀燈可知之；帝后至微行觀燈，正見民間燈市之盛。何以謂盛於宋，蓋自唐以後，常於正月十五日之夜開坊市門燃燈。至宋又將燃燈擴展至上元前後各一日，即正月十四·十五·十六三日也。其後增至十七十八夜，而以十三日上燈也。故至今民間尙以十三日爲上燈夜，十八日爲落燈夜，蓋本於此。宋代張燈之日，自大內正門結綵爲山樓影燈，起路臺，敎坊陳百戲，天子先幸　觀行番，遂御樓，或御東華門及東西角樓，飲從臣。四夷　客：各依本國歌舞，列於樓下。東華左右掖門，東西角樓，城門大道，大　觀寺院，悉起山棚，張樂陳燈，皇城雉堞亦避設之。眞所謂火樹銀花，城開不夜，想見宋代張燈之盛。至微宗時尤　事增華，故水滸中所說看燈情形，非嚮壁虛造可比。</p>
<p>不但上元張燈，即中元下元亦張燈，蓋所謂「三元觀燈」是也。如宋史載太平興　二年七月中元節，御東角樓觀燈，賜從官宴飲。五年十月下元節，依中元例，張燈三夜。又如吳越王錢俶傳，七月中元，京師張燈，太宗令有司於俶宅前設燈山，陝聲樂以寵之。諸如此類，不一而是，故謂盛於宋。徽宗時，宮中乃至用龍涎沉腦屑，和蠟爲燭，兩行列數百枝，艷明而香溢，鈞天所無也。南渡後久絕此。惟草太后回鑾沙漠，復値高宗壽，高宗極天下之養，用宣政故事，然僅列數十炬，太后陽若不聞。高宗奉卮，問此燭頗愜聖意吾？后曰，爾爹爹每夜常設數百枝，諸閣亦然。高宗因后起更衣，微謂吳后曰，如何比得爹爹富貴。以見燭猶如此，宜政間燈市之奢靡可知矣。</p>
<p>風俗相沿，元宵之爲燈節，迄今猶然。淸室嘗於上元夕西廠舞燈，放烟火最盛。皇帝於未申之交，駕至西廠，先之以八旗馳馬諸戲，或一足立鞍　而馳者；或兩足立馬背而馳者；或攀馬鞍步行而並馬馳者，或兩人對面馳來，各在馬上騰身互換者；或甲騰出，乙在馬上戴甲於首而馳者，曲盡馬上之奇。日旣夕，則樓前舞燈者，三千人列隊焉，口唱太平歌，各執綵燈，循環進止，各依其所綴兆。一轉旋，則三千人排成一太字；再轉成平字，以次作萬歲字；又以次合成「太平萬袋」字所謂「太平萬賞字當中」（此爲宮詞中語）是也。舞罷則煩火大發，其聲如　　，火光燭半空，但見千萬紅魚，奮迅跳　雲海內，極天下之　觀也。</p>
<p>按樂舞中列成頌祝詞句，始於唐高宗武后所作聖壽樂中，舞者一百四十人，金鋼冠，五色畫衣，舞之行列必成字，十六變而　；有聖超千古，道泰百王，皇帝萬年，寳祚彌昌等字句，由此可知，太平萬歲之舞，殆亦脫胎於此也。（此風並流行及於高麗。）</p>
<p>燈之製，有紙有絹，精粗　絕。市上所售之燈，有走馬燈，蓮花燈，馬燈，兎燈，蟹燈，飛機燈，畫船燈，乃至於飛禽昆蟲，元寳金錢等，形形色色，莫不有燈。然皆粗陋小足觀，僅供兒童之玩弄。上海例於舊歷年初，陳燈於福佑路舊校塲街之一隅，即豫園相近處，設攤求售。自南京路幾家百貨公司，兼售燈，於是燈亦厠於大公司商品之林。及八一三滬戰作。豫園燈市星散，乃多由各紙紥店製成門售矣。</p>
<p>走馬燈之製，頗饒有科學意味，以蘆蓋作輪軸，植立於燈中。輪之面，以紙條斜拗折自中心輻射，分布於輪之四周，宛若白傘。在輪軸下端綴以針，用小蜆壳相承，故圓轉自如，而以紙筒籠之。又剪紙作人馬狀，自紙輸之緣，懸綫下垂於紙筒之外，燃燭於紙筒之內，軸下端橫桿上。及燭燄高燒，筒內空氣膨脹，加以冷熱交流之作用，鼓動上蓋之紙輪，牽動下垂之人馬，團　走轉，故謂之走馬燈。一日，朱志堯先生又相與談機械製造之業，亦及走馬燈，志堯先生云，輓近新式發電之透平Turbine，其製作與今之走馬燈上之紙輪無相殊，一則用以爲工業之原動力，一則僅爲兒童之玩具，得失之間，不可以道里計也。</p>
<p>晨初以各幫限價購買、開盤前人心較好、乃吿六千六百五十元開盤，且匯票大豐及天成德大德記等續有撈吸、再漲五元、爲六千六百五十五元、嗣報外匯鬆硬、銀行幫證劵幫不少賣戶菌集、而鑫源亦吐、跌勢頗猛、終於不支中退入六千六百元關內、吿六千五百九十八元、尙賴成記寳康等維持、不久回出六千六百元大關、達六千六百十五元、不料市塲忽傳日本對華正式宜戰之說、雖消息利空利多難斷、而賣戶更切、如鑫源續塞不怠、致重入六百元內、吿六千五百九十元低盤、但午收散戶檯面買進了結、升至六千六百十二元收市、比上日軋小二十四元、半日上落六十五元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤期交高六十餘元、收進比售價低四十元、現標金鮮聞做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦掛低十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行初仍掛六百九十元、十一點光景低十元、爲六百八十元、收進减三十元、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市多空角逐　—市價起落甚烈—</h3>
<p>公炸暗盤、昨日市况、多空雙方競爭甚烈、多方補空及新做頗見繁榮、如協康、長春·甡昶，各家均有數十萬胃量、丙種市價驟高至五元四角、比隔日幾好一元、不料隔日會買進之德隆號及允大號、忽來復出、市價漲又回小一元之譜、再以胡鶴記·易中·仁昌·買進、又回好五六角、而裕興·信孚·同康·聯　·恒康及一般散戶紛紛賣出、市價再回鬆一二角、多空雙方競爭之烈、使市價震盪波動不已、忽起忽落、趨勢已在緩緩轉變、前途當可漸漸好轉、昨日甲種爲連籤之最後一日、連籤不連籤、各人觀念不同、料於除中籤後甲種當可脫頴而出、戊種最賤、已漸有人垂靑、市價結果、乙丁兩種略小、餘均回好一角半至六角半、成交的有三百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、類別最高最低收盤比前日</p>
<p>股票交易、成交漢冶萍股五百股、價爲四元七角半、</p>
<p>紗花　雜牌紗價日下　雙馬尙在掙扎</p>
<p>紗市平淡乏勁、此因實際交易滯鈍、且各路運輸困難、所以有一部份做多心思轉趨淡泊、將多額逐步脫卸、惟證券幫大都拖進、雙馬籌碼關閉、仍不放鬆、因之雜牌紗因銷塲停頓、市價日下、但雙馬市價尙能獨昂也、二十支雙馬最高價爲一千四百九十六元、低價爲一千四百八十一元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因上日午後人氣散漫、情况仍續軟象、首盤價爲一千四百八十六元、此盤一開、市態益呈假痴假呆之象、檯面上多頭雖支持、然巨量的吃戶不勇、微升至一千四百九十六元、旋聞現紗交易、淸淡如常、絕少發展氣色、同時天女。金城等紗價目旣下、而乏受主、市價又轉下降至一千四白八十一元、然多方心意殊强、又復回昂在一千四百八十五元之間、站立一小時有半、可想多空兩方爭持劇烈也、最後收盤價爲一千四百八十八元、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港　九〇同行六、四五〇</p>
<p>統計六、五三五</p>
<h3>棉花再挫</h3>
<p>現棉情况續趨下挫、此因紗旣不振、銷路停頓、目雜牌紗價更廉、所以廠方購辦心思轉滯、同時外匯父見放長、棉花行情乃向下風、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因各方皆取觀望之態、故市况平淡呆滯不進、結果收盤價格、較之上日低落一二磅音、</p>
<p>印棉亦疲、仍因多頭了結而跌，昨連同預測低落二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來各方對於原棉之採購、頗覺不興奮、無論廠方同業、似皆等待機會、目下不願多進、因之市况已趨平靜、而大量成交、更不多見、或許繁盛之期、將暫隔數日也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布客銷呆滯　—售盤所跌過於漲</h3>
<p>廠布　咋市趨軟、乃緣客路實銷呆滯、兼以紗價日貶、人心下游、售盤紊亂、成交廖寥、白貨一部份粗細布斜紋每疋跌二角半至五角、富貴細布晨開四十四元七角半、午後跌至四十四元二角半、漂染布每疋跌五角左右、本街成交各布三百餘件、浙路甬台幫辦細布漂布等一百餘件、閩幫辦藍布色斜漂布等一百數十件、粤港幫新交易大見淸閒、</p>
<p>東布　昨因紗市挫跌、人心續軟、白貨細布每疋跌落五角之譜、十二磅龍頭現出至午牧盤爲四十九元六角半、交易所本月份期貨五十元零三角、色貨四君子嗶嘰成交雖不多、而貨底轉緊、仍售一元三角五、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆餅投機聲勢浩大</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、先承上日之軟勢、行情續見挫跌、入後內地幫及港幫略有現餅去路、致一般踢皮球作家又是掀風播浪、買聲高於一切、塲中市氣頓呈緊張局面、但結果求多供少、市面反無特色、祇回升四五分、統計成交元隆餅一車，價爲十五元三角、又二月下交一車、（價詳市價欄）三月上五車、三月下一車、肥字餅二月下十五車、利字餅二月上一千片、二月下二千片、姓記現餅五百片、二月下一千片、三月上一萬餘片、三月下一萬餘片云、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價升降摩定</h3>
<p>昨日糖市起伏不定、公會劃盤、二四粗白外棧現貨八十元零五角、本月十日打單八十元零八角至一元、後又回至零九角、小三角、二十五日打單八十一元六角至一元九角、升二角、下月一日打單八十一元六角至二元三角、升一角、下午現貨八十一元四角、太古車白B嘜八十元零八角至一元元五角、升五角、HX嘜現貨七十八元三角、二十五日打單七十九元二角、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤屑新貨到</h3>
<p>煤球原料之鴻基白煤屑、前曾一度缺少、以致外傳烟屑製球之說、後經證明不確、日昨某公司之（Melar）輪有新貨六千五百噸裝到、計統煤一千二百噸、煤屑五千三百噸、業在起卸上棧、故本市存底充實、煤球原料、無處缺乏云、</p>

<h3>確定計劃</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>—寫在開學的時候—</p>
<p>時光是匆匆的過去，轉眼之間，兩星期的寒假已毫不留情的和我們作趴，而自上星期起，每一個小朋友，又開始恢復了常態，去度學校生活。在這開學的當兒，筆者有一件事情要提醒小朋友的，就是確定未來半年中的讀書計劃。關於這，每一個小朋友是不可忽略而應該去實行的。</p>
<p>俗語說：一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨。我們讀書可以半年之計在於開學之初來說。天下的事如果沒有計劃，就決不會成功，我們讀書亦然。所以當此開學之初，最重要的一個問題，就在確定計劃。聖賢告訴我們，凡事預則立，不預則廢，所謂預」，就是預先確定了計劃，再照計劃去做，那無論怎樣困難的事，都可做得成功。反過來說，去做一件事情，事前一些沒有計劃，那就不會有成功的希望。</p>
<p>明白到這一點，那麽就可看出我們如果希望在未來半年之中，讀書得有相當的進步，事前非確定一個讀書計劃不可。過去比較不好的功課，本學期應加倍努力。比校好的，也不能有自滿之心而荒廢。每天抽幾小時當做課外工作。何時寫字？何時讀書？課外看此什麼書？每一個月看完幾部書？看那幾部書？寫些什麼文章？何時寫日記？什麽都要確定了計劃，並列成一個讀書計劃表。</p>
<p>然而最後，還有一點特別重耍的，就是要能够實打。讀書計劃確定了，就得每大，每月，依照表上所列的去讀，去寫。吾則計劃在開學之初確定，但開學後並不照計劃做，那和沒有計劃完全相同，遼是不發生效果。所以我們計劃確定了，就該什麼都依照計劃進行，那麽在未來的一學期中，準會有相當的進步的。</p>
<p>域，悲憤的情感，便把他激發起來。他刻苦自勵，暗自團結着國人，圖謀掀起革命運動來，把暹羅的國家光復。結果經過了三决的苦戰，三决打退緬人，暹羅是在鄭昭的手裏史生了。失地收復，國恥盡雪，那些暹民應該是多麽的感戴鄭昭呢？鄭昭在萬民擁戴之下做了暹羅復國第一個國王。此後亦復振作，直至與淸朝聯軍征服了整個的緬甸。</p>
<p>鄭昭沒有兒子，以暹羅土人華策格里做養子，後來却把女兒嫁給了他。鄭昭死後，華策格里承襲王位。這樣　代」代的推演下去，便成了今日的暹羅。我們的先輩是那樣的做了暹羅的功人：而今日的暹羅對我們華僑反是那樣的虐待備至！這究竟是什麽原因呢？小朋友，你們細細硏究一下吧。</p>
<h3>新年多吃的結果</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>過了一個廢曆新年，阿亮的肚子裏滿裝滿了那些油膩的東西，像紅燒肉鹹肉等等，一時不易消化，便囤積在胃腸中，於是使他的胃口减退了，飯量由二滿减到一碗碗也吃不完，而且排洩出來的大便也不正常，他便把種種在吃飯的時侯告訴了他的媽媽。</p>
<p>「這是你多吃油膩的東西以及其他糖果等閒食的緣故呀！從今以後，東西須少吃，而多吃些蔬菜，不久便會好的。」他母親喃喃地對他說着。</p>
<p>「這是什麽道理呢？」他更仔細的問着同桌的爸爸。</p>
<p>「把油膩的肉類食物吃入肚中，消化比較緩慢，如果一多吃，胃腸來不及把它們在一時中消化，於是囤積起來，便引起食慾不增的現象。食物雖是件很重要的事悄，它可以幫助成長，而且有保持康健，更能給與活動的力量的功用，但這是指正常的食物而言，如果吃得過多，非但無益，反而有引起胃病的害處。所以各人應當儘着自己的胃來吃。吃到適度爲止而且吃的東西不應偏於一二種的食物，有的喜歡吃肉不要吃蔬菜；有的愛吃蔬菜，而不甚吃肉類；這也是不對的。要知道各人應適應環境，跟從習慣而自由選擇食物的時候，使種的營養不致發生缺乏，所以應注意食物須供給必要份量的營養分蛋白質，礦物質和各種維他命，「換句話說。就是不論蔬菜和肉類，不分嫌好，都應該有一吃的必要。因爲蔬菜中供給礦物質很豐富，肉類中含有蛋白質比較來得多還有其他的維他命等等，我們食物的目的，並不是吃它們的鮮味如何，而是要攝取其中能維持生命的養分而已，而鮮味僅是引起我們想吃的動機罷了。你這幾天來的不消化現象，當然是多吃的結果，那你現在最好少吃爲妙讓它肚子餓，因爲肚子餓是件好現象。決不應肚肚子一餓便拼命的吃。下决你在食物的時候應當注意把桌面上每一樣小菜都有的一嘗必要。而且除了一日三餐之外，其他的閒食和點心都要戒掉，包你不會再發生這種消化不良的現象了。」</p>
<p>方法把水留住不使它流去，因此就要造堤壩了。它們的牙齒很厲害，把一棵小樹在近根地方四周咬着，越咬越細，這樹自己便會倒下來，然後把枝葉統統咬去，拖到河中，壓入水底，埋在河底泥土中，使它穩固，再將咬下的枝葉編織成壩，用泥土石塊堆在上面，它們的工具是嘴和兩隻前脚，因工作人員多而且認眞，所以不久便成績斐然了；再靠河中流來的砂泥雜物，積聚起來，越積越厚，越厚便越堅固了。假使它們肯在堤壩上開個缺口，使河水仍舊順利流去還好，否則河水被堤壩擋住，便向兩岸泛瀾起來，往往闖下大禍，把房屋田園冲去，所以海狸實是有害的動物。</p>
<h3>邏羅復興的主人</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>在這越南時局極度緊張的時候，我們瞧到報紙上面時有泰國如何如何的消息載着，這事不在本文範圍之內，暫且不談，泰國即是暹羅；我們來回溯暹羅復國的歷史，略述如後：</p>
<p>暹羅是曾經滅亡的，而爲滅亡的暹羅收拾殘局，再造光榮歷史的，却是中國人鄭昭。</p>
<p>在前淸時候，廣東潮州澄海縣有個姓鄭名昭的人，在很小的年紀便跟他爸爸飄流到暹羅去，他們在那裹一住便幾十年，這個鄭昭竟做了暹羅的宰相了。</p>
<p>暹羅和緬甸是兩個有着世仇的國家，乾隆年間緬王率兵攻伐暹羅，把暹兵打得落花流水，佔領了所有的土地。還把前王的遺族殲殺得一個不剩。那時鄭昭已經五十餘歲了，他早就罷官隱居在暹羅南部一個很幽僻的地方。國家發生了變故之後，他年紀雖老，而雄心不老，眼看着大好河山淪爲異</p>

<p>甲孩：你生在什麽地方的？</p>
<p>乙孩：我是生在醫院裏的。</p>
<p>甲孩：啊，你害什麽病？</p>
<p>敎師：你們大家要牢記着靠左邊走。</p>
<p>學生：先生，不對，來的靠左走，去的也靠左邊走，不是大家要碰頭了嗎？</p>
<p>敎師：你爲什麽又遲到了，老是每天這樣的。</p>
<p>學生：我走得慢呀！</p>
<p>敎師：爲什麽不走快些？</p>
<p>學生：路上許多的路牌叫我這樣的。</p>
<p>敎師：怎樣？你看到些什麽路牌？</p>
<p>舉生：「前有學校，慢行！」</p>
<h3>有建築技能的海狸</h3>
<p>— 方衡</p>
<p>海狸這個名字，小朋友們或許不大熟悉，是的，它們的家離我們很遠，住在北美洲呢！所以我得將它們的狀貌先介紹一下，然後說它們怎樣來建造屋子和堤壩。</p>
<p>因爲它們愛咬東西，像老鼠兔子一樣，研究動物的學者把來歸入齧齒類內。身體大的有二英尺長，頭部有點像鼠類，最奇怪的却是尾巴和後脚，造物者爲便於它們游泳起見，賜以一條扁平有鱗如同小漿的尾巴，和生着網　的後脚，游泳時後脚划着，尾巴就成了一面舵；不但可以當舵，還可以當作椅子，吃東西或咬樹木時候，就坐在這把椅子上。它們歡喜水，</p>
<p>所以家宅總在水邊的楊柳樹中間，它們在地面掘上兩個洞，直通到河底，像條隧道，這就是進出的大門，也就走這這條隧道到河底去找它們的糧食。</p>
<p>就在地洞上面蓋起屋子來，蓋得非常好，宛如一座小砲壘，材料是樹枝泥土和小石塊，它們把這些材料收集攏來，用天賦的建築天才，蓋造得相當堅固，內部也很講究，有細枝嫩葉編織成的地氈和床褥，海狸們就在這裹享受它們的天倫之樂。</p>
<p>海狸最愛水，但是冬季中河水要淺涸的，於是它們就想</p>

<h3>老旦的將來</h3>
<p>— 谷梅</p>
<p>老旦在元據中有用凈扮的，崑曲裏是小丑應工，平劇常把老生來抱演，北方謝寶庭周長山都是老生兼老且，正工老旦只有一龔雲甫，龔後有臥雲居士，陳文啟，文榮壽，李多奎。此外注桂芬，（附圖）汪笑儂，劉鴻聲，王鳳卿，都能演老旦。南方近二十年來，富仙舫外，趙君玉，毛韻珂，呂月樵皆能串老旦。現在老輩相繼云亡，後輩有嗓習老生，有貌學花衫，有嗓無貌唱大花臉小花臉，老旦成了冷門。近十年來，北方只有一李多奎還有些老旦氣味，可是只會唱不會做。文亮辰雖擅長於做派，又是沒有嗓子。李多奎自前歲和他的琴師陸五，柝夥以後，腔調就不如過去耐味。（陸本是龔雲甫琴手）文亮辰又於前年病故了，短中取長，只有孫甫亭。孫是做不及文亮辰，唱不過李多奎。現在起來一個馬履雲，曾配過金少山唱「斷太后」，除了嗓子以外，嘴上身上和腔調還須要大大加以研究。在更新唱過的張菊芳，何盛淸，黃金唱的張盛餘，李金泉，那都是等而下之了。</p>
<p>南方不出老旦，但是獨出武生串老旦戲。像何月山，楊瑞亭，應寶蓮，配角老旦倒有幾個，如何潤初，劉振庭，所以坤角老生改行的張少泉，儼然成了南方李多奎；現在她的姑娘出道，（就是電影明星李麗華）財吒身弱，張少泉不如三年前會唱肯做支持江南半壁河山時的張少泉了。南方再要聽老旦單挑戲，除了楊瑞亭反串以外，不會有了。</p>
<p>北方老旦現在都行龔雲甫一派，南方早年，是多宗汪桂芬。在桂芬在上海，喜歡唱老且戲，所以楊瑞亭，吳桂芬，孫桂芬串老旦，唱腔中多數還是在派。趙君玉私底下哼幾句也是在調。呂月樵，毛韻珂又是在的成份多。現在呢，串老且的多老了，學老旦的都死了，除了勿像腔，勿登樣，幾個總算老旦以外，大班裏都是小丑老生扮了。北方像馬連良班中馬富祿，李少春班中李寶奎，南方卡爾登李長山，黃金陳菊舫，大舞台張桂芳，都很好。不久將來老且一行無疑的要歸於淘汰，將回復了當年由老生小丑兼演的老例。守蕪</p>

<p>「塞上風雲」旣以塞外爲背景，外景隊便浩浩蕩蕩的去過一决，現在從塞外採辦來的該片服裝道具亦已到了重慶了，內景部分，便將立即開拍，屆時攝影塲上，當是一番塞外風光也。</p>
<p>民華的第二部鉅片「世界兒女」，聞將於中德央三國文字劇本全部完成後才開拍。該片中重要脚色有四五人之多，已決定者有張翼藍蘭兩人，餘者將儘量採用新人充任。</p>

<h3>曹禺新作　「北京人」脫稿寄滬</h3>
<p>曹禺在上海時，曾經答應上海劇藝社編寫一部劇本，該劇定名「北京人」，但是寫了一幕後，却又擱筆，另外完成「蛻變」「正在想」二劇，除「正在想」已爲上海劇藝社演出外，「蛻變」則因環境關係，無法公演。茲聞「北京人」劇已經完成，不日就可寄到上海，上海劇藝社當然立刻加以排練了。至於曹禺的又一作品「爭强」，劇藝社已元「撒謊世界」後公演。</p>
<p>「雷雨」一劇，自初决演出後，即哄動一時，吸引着無數觀衆，博得各界之好評，於是中旅劇團之聲譽，亦日漸響著。深爲一般觀衆所擁護直到現在，近來中旅又排演「雷雨」，於是各劇團也隨之而起，紛紛排演「雷雨」，這可知道「雷雨」之價値了。不過這戲演了這許多時候，我的腦海中始終浮起着這樣一個疑問，——就是劇中人的年齡問題。</p>
<p>在劇本上所載各人年齡：</p>
<p>周樸園—五十五歲</p>
<p>周繁漪—三十五歲</p>
<p>周萍—二十八歲</p>
<p>周冲—十七歲</p>
<p>魯貴—四十八歲</p>
<p>魯侍萍—四十七歲</p>
<h3>「雷雨」的年齡問題</h3>
<p>— 張慧宇</p>
<p>魯大海—二十七歲</p>
<p>魯四鳳—十八歲</p>
<p>以上的年齡，都是三十年後的。那末我們照上表推算他們三十年前的年齡，周樸園應是二十五歲，魯侍萍是十七歲，那末周萍和魯大海應是幾歲呢？此就是我懷疑的年齡問題</p>
<p>周樸園和魯侍萍分離三十年，是從侍萍抱了剛世的魯大海出走的時候起，此時周萍和魯大海都已出生了，唯周萍長魯大海一歲。照此算米，周萍至少有三十一歲，大海至少有二十歲。而人物表上之年齡周萍是二十八歲，魯大海是二十七歲。此眞是令人不解之疑問，問題雖然她無關緊要，若不加注意，則成笑話矣。</p>
<p>（編者按：關於「雷雨」劇中人的年齡問題，前曾有人談起過，這正如「一年間」的女主人生下一個懷孕十二個月的孩子一樣，不過是作者偶然的疏忽而已。各劇團以後演出時，不妨將年齡改正可也。）</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army in Southern Henan Recaptures Queshan - Fleeing Japanese Troops Retreat Towards Xinyang - Over 4,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action in Nanyang</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Today's news: Regarding the situation in Henan Province, the Japanese troops who launched an attack on January 24th have now been driven back to approximately their original positions. The Chinese army has successfully recaptured Queshan and several areas east and west of the railway. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to well-informed Chinese sources here, although the final outcome of the war in southern Henan remains to be seen, the Japanese offensive in Henan Province appears to be coming to an end without achieving any significant results. This Japanese offensive, which began on January 24th from Xinyang, was purportedly carried out by four divisions, but in reality, it only involved about two and a half divisions. Although the Japanese captured Nanyang on February 5th, the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack and recaptured the city on [day of the week]. As a result, the Japanese launched a general retreat and are now withdrawing towards Tongbai, in other words, back to their base near Xinyang. It is reported that the Japanese suffered heavy losses in this retreat. According to Chinese military authorities, the Chinese army had intelligence of the Japanese plans to attack at least a week before the Japanese advance, as it was learned that the Japanese mechanized units were heavily concentrated near Xinyang. Therefore, elite troops were quickly dispatched to southern Henan, arriving in time to resist the Japanese. These elite troops are known for their fighting prowess, and they dealt a severe blow to the Japanese, inflicting significant casualties. The Japanese could not withstand the attack and retreated southwest to their base. Well-informed Chinese sources here predict a major battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies this spring. The Japanese may attempt to take Enshi via Yichang along the south bank of the Yangtze River to infiltrate Chongqing, making a desperate gamble. It is estimated that the Japanese will mobilize fifteen divisions for this operation, but transportation will be a major difficulty. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army has inflicted a defeat on the Japanese in the Henan Province campaign. The Japanese troops, who advanced north along the Pinghan Railway from Xinyang on January 24th, reaching almost 120 miles and nearly reaching [city name], have now been driven back south of Suiping by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops who spread out east and west of the railway have also been repulsed. The Chinese army has also recaptured Puyang, 85 miles west of the railway, and has inflicted over 4,000 casualties on the Japanese in this campaign. The Chinese army has now established a new position at Tanghe. Chinese sources also stated that the Chinese army recaptured Suiping on Wednesday morning, and Zhumadian and Runan yesterday morning. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) After the Chinese army in southern Henan recaptured Zhumadian, they continued to attack Beiyue fiercely, annihilating many Japanese troops. The Japanese are collapsing towards Xinyang, and the Chinese are continuing to mop up. Also, many Japanese soldiers surrendered during the Nanyang campaign. (2) Since the 24th of last month, the Japanese who invaded Xiaocaodian, Lanqiandian, and Yangqiao from Xinyang, Taichangtai Pass, and other places were intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. It is estimated that over 700 Japanese soldiers were killed at Xiaocaodian and Zhangzhuangdian (both northwest of Xinyang), over 300 at Dougou (west of Changtaiguan) on the 26th, over 600 at Lanqiandian and Huchongdian (west of Minggang) on the 27th, and over 900 at Paiqiao (east of Zhumadian) on the 28th. (3) The Chinese army on the opposite bank of Yichang attacked the Japanese strongholds at Daqiuji and Zhaojiayao on the morning of the 4th. After a fierce battle, the Chinese captured many supplies. (4) On the morning of the 2nd, a Japanese unit invaded Lingbei Li, but after a heavy blow from the Chinese army, the Japanese abandoned their corpses and weapons and fled. (5) The Japanese who attacked Longgang bypassed Yangxia (northwest of Longgang). The Chinese army met them head-on, and a fierce battle is underway. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Lihuang - Since the Chinese army launched a counterattack on the invading Japanese forces on the Pinghan Railway front, after several days and nights of fierce fighting, they finally defeated the Japanese. Shangcai, Xiping, Wuyang, Xiangcheng, Luohe, and other places have been successively recaptured by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese forces were forced to retreat to the Zhaoche River area between Fangcheng and Nanyang, where the Chinese are encircling and annihilating them. The Japanese have suffered over ten thousand casualties in recent days. The Chinese have captured hundreds of rifles, over a thousand mules and horses, and many other military supplies, which are currently being inventoried. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Hosts Mr. Currie - Mr. Currie Visits Various Officials - And Attends a Banquet Hosted by Vice President Kung</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Mr. Lauchlin Currie, the US President Roosevelt's personal envoy to China, accompanied by his staff, paid courtesy visits to various ministries and commissions on the morning of the 8th, making initial calls. At noon, Vice President Kung hosted a banquet, inviting heads of various agencies to attend. In the evening, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for Mr. Currie. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet tonight to entertain Dr. Lauchlin Currie, the aide to the US President, and his assistant, Mr. Theodore Theberge. Before attending the banquet hosted by Chairman Chiang, they also attended a banquet hosted by Finance Minister Kung. According to diplomatic circles, these two foreign guests will be feted every day for the next two weeks. It is reported that the authorities have instructed six ministers to be in frequent contact with Mr. Currie and to assist in gathering information on the Chinese economy. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today, newspapers continue to comment on Mr. Currie's visit to China. The "Shishi Xinbao" stated that Mr. Currie intends to formulate precise, effective, and concrete plans for aid to China, and can point out appropriate directions for China's economic efforts. The "Dagongbao" stated, "Today, we no longer need to talk about gratitude for aid to China. In a nutshell, the question is how to defeat Japan and pacify the Pacific situation. Since the Washington Conference, the United States has missed opportunities many times. Now the problem has reached a narrow path, and Japan must fail no matter what. But how to achieve this? First, China must not fail. Effective aid to China and even the United States taking action themselves are necessary. The entire Chinese army and people are fighting bravely, and they are bearing the primary responsibility of defending the Pacific.

<h3>Japan Considering Declaring War on China - Demanding Belligerent Rights - To Establish a Blockade of Rangoon - Germany Attempts to Facilitate a Soviet-Japanese Pact</h3>
<p>Washington - According to newspapers affiliated with the Scripps-Howard syndicate, Japan is currently considering formally declaring war on China in order to demand belligerent rights and establish a blockade of Rangoon in the Indian Ocean. However, Japan first requested that Berlin pressure the Soviet Union to stop supplying China and to conclude a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty. Germany is currently striving to facilitate this agreement so that Japan will have a free hand to contain the United States in the Pacific and obstruct its continued aid to China.

<p>Tokyo - The "Hochi Shimbun" published an editorial today discussing Japan's southward advance policy, stating that it is obvious that Japan must find a way out in the South Seas, which needs no further explanation. The editorial stated, "Our country is now concentrating all its efforts on building a so-called 'highly tense nation.' This requires obtaining sufficient natural resources. Therefore, if we want to implement a southward advance, we must immediately resolve the various problems that hinder it. Japan's current tasks are threefold: (1) Resolving the 'China Incident,' (2) Adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations, and (3) Reforming the domestic system. As for the China Incident, the fact that it has been prolonged cannot be solely blamed on Prime Minister Konoe. The reason is that we were careless and unaware of its true seriousness, which led to this situation. Fortunately, we have a good grasp of the military aspects, which is somewhat comforting. However, there are many problems other than military ones that need to be resolved urgently. The reason why the current situation is still chaotic and why Japan is still suffering is all due to this. As for Japanese-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union is eyeing us in the north, posing a great threat to Japan. We have no choice but to station a large number of troops on the northern border to guard against unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, before advancing south, we must reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to withdraw these troops from the border. This is very clear. As for the reform of various domestic systems, it is not yet perfect. Before starting the great task of advancing south, we must gather the enthusiasm of the people and establish a new system, which is an urgent matter." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Qujiang - Chinese guerrilla forces shot down a Japanese naval aircraft near Zhongshan County on the afternoon of the 5th, killing several Japanese officers. Their bodies were shattered beyond recognition. From the documents they carried, it was determined that they were from the command headquarters of the Combined Southern Fleet. The deceased were identified as Admiral Osami, Vice Admiral Suga Hiko-no-jo, Lieutenant Commander Kakuda Takao, Shirahama Eiichi, Lieutenant Commander (Paymaster) Tatsumi Chugoro, Adjutant Lieutenant (Navy) Matsuda Hideo, and pilot Kurose Inashio (pilot in command), and engineer Kono Hiroaki, and officer Takaoka Shinmei. This further proves that Osami was leading his staff to assume command of the Combined Southern Fleet in order to launch a southward advance. Unexpectedly, he died en route after taking off from Guangzhou towards Hainan Island at noon that day. Osami was born in the 9th year of Meiji (1876), is 65 years old, and graduated from the Naval War College.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Starting with the Repeated Defeats of the Italian Army</h3>
<p>Italy has fared poorly in the Balkan campaign, is facing a blockade in the Mediterranean, and is suffering defeats in North and East Africa. Its army seems unable to withstand a major war, and the commanders at the front have been repeatedly replaced, even three or four times. All of this reveals numerous weaknesses. As for the air force, despite its self-proclaimed excellence, it has achieved nothing of substance. Shortly after the start of the war, Italian Air Marshal Balbo died in a mysterious plane crash. Even the Minister of Foreign Affairs has now taken on the role of bomber squadron leader, indicating a lack of talent. The navy is clearly inadequate. For eight months, it has not only been silent and inactive,不敢出戰， even hiding in Taranto, where more than half of it was destroyed by the British. Although the situation in Albania has stabilized somewhat recently, there has been no news of any special victories taking advantage of the sudden death of Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. On the contrary, in North Africa and East Africa, which have been supposedly cultivated for many years, defeats have been repeated. Not only has the capital of Cyrenaica, Benghazi, fallen after Tobruk and Derna, but Eritrea and Italian Somaliland are also facing emergencies. And Abyssinia, conquered years ago, is both under attack from the British and South African forces from the north and south and is also severely threatened by Emperor Selassie's efforts to restore the country. Looking at the overall situation in the African campaign these days, it confirms the speculation of some British military experts yesterday, leading to suspicions that, under the panic of having their return route cut off, the Blackshirts may completely abandon their positions in Africa.</p>
<p>Of course, it seems too early to assert that Italy has already been defeated. It is likely that the clever Hitler has already taken a reverse-takeover approach, "borrowing" Italy's air force bases and sending many "experts" to Italy to "help." Under this form of disguised supervision, unless a revolution occurs within the Italian nation, it seems unimaginable that the Rome government under Mussolini will be the first to "sue for peace" due to military defeats. However, from the British perspective, it is not difficult to see clearly that the London government, while adopting a defensive posture in the British Isles, preparing to deal with a German landing or large-scale air raid, is indeed adopting an offensive posture in the Mediterranean, with the ambition to quickly destroy Italy's entire war effort and force Rome to "yield" first.</p>
<p>Originally, the British war against the Axis powers in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean could no longer attempt to attack the continent due to France's armistice. In order to gain the initiative, they had no choice but to turn to the Mediterranean coast and attack the weaker link in the Axis, Italy. If Britain were to defeat Italy, it would not only passively dismantle the Axis line, reducing the constraints on the war against Germany, but also actively gain many practical benefits, which could shorten the path to final victory.</p>
<p>First, if Italy surrenders, part of its naval strength could be transferred to Britain. In this way, the London government could not only withdraw most of its warships from the Mediterranean Fleet to confront Germany in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, but also free up some strength to strengthen the Far East Fleet, thereby suppressing Japan's蠢動 towards the South Seas.</p>
<p>Second, if Italy surrenders, the Mediterranean would truly become a "British lake." If the French and Spanish fleets continue to remain neutral, British merchant ships could travel unhindered in the Mediterranean, and the routes to the Far East and India would be shortened by more than half because they would no longer have to go around the Cape of Good Hope. Shortening and maintaining sea routes are not only of commercial value, of course.</p>
<p>Third, strategically speaking, if the Mediterranean is completely controlled by Britain, then the attitudes of the various powers around the Mediterranean would inevitably undergo major changes. According to the estimation of Major Allie Ewart, a military reporter for the New York "Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao," not only would Spain become more "pro-British," but all French territories in North Africa would be more supportive of Pétain, resisting Germany's demands. Even the Balkans would be affected, allowing the countries of Southeast Europe to resolutely resist Axis pressure in the future, and Syria would purely become a sphere of influence for Britain and Turkey.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that if Britain can defeat Italy first, it can obtain the above-mentioned benefits. In other words, if Italy loses, Hitler would have to endure the above-mentioned disadvantages. This is why, after observing the Italian-Greek war for more than two months, he finally had to change his policy and take active action to aid Italy. His first step was to withdraw part of the strength from the German Air Force and use Italy's bases to directly attack British fleets and merchant ships in the Mediterranean. This is something that the British Mediterranean Fleet cannot ignore. As US Rear Admiral Sterling stated yesterday, a fleet operating near an enemy air force base without sufficient air force protection is simply a "target" for enemy aircraft and is bound to be greatly troubled. Therefore, the need for the British Air Force to be replenished in large quantities has reached a stage of "extreme urgency." As for why Hitler has intensified his pressure on the Vichy government in recent days, attempting to obtain the remaining French fleet and use its ports, it shows how eagerly he wants to save Italy's decline in the Mediterranean. Because if he can use the French and Italian fleets, in conjunction with the German and Italian air forces, and with the French and Italian ports as bases, Hitler can indeed compete with Britain for air and sea control in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>While Germany is intensifying its actions in the Mediterranean, it can still launch offensives in the English Channel or the Balkan Peninsula at any time to divert attention. There is no doubt that, on the eve of this final struggle of the Axis powers and the expansion of various fronts, the eyes of the world cannot help but focus on the pivotal United States. Because how the Washington government will actively assist Britain to seize the initiative has indeed become a turning point in the future evolution of the European and African war situation, and even the situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Non-Applicability of Lend-Lease to the Soviets; US House Rejects; Ban on US Ships Sailing in War Zones; Passed After Fierce Debate</h3>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday continued its heated debate on the President's Lend-Lease Act, having passed an amendment regarding the prohibition of American ships sailing in designated war zones, stipulating that the various measures of the Lend-Lease Act shall not alter the provisions of the Neutrality Act.  Another amendment, proposing to exclude the Soviet Union from the countries to be aided under the Lend-Lease Act, was voted down by 185 votes to 94.  The bill was proposed by Congressman Tinkham, a Republican from Massachusetts, who claimed that the Soviet Union opposes everything that is British. Government officials urged Congress not to pass it, otherwise it would force the Soviet Union into the embrace of the Axis powers. Congressman Johnson, a Democrat from Texas, said, "If the House passes this bill, it would be an unwarranted slap in the face to the Soviet Union. At a time when Germany, Italy, and Japan are trying to woo the Soviet Union into the Axis, if the United States suddenly delivers a gigantic slap, Germany and Japan will be overjoyed." Congressman McCormack, a Democrat from Massachusetts, called the bill "unwise and dangerous."  Furthermore, Congressman Rayburn, a Democrat from Texas and the majority leader, stated that the government would firmly resist any new amendments other than those proposed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, including the one proposed by Congressman Wadsworth, a Republican from New York, limiting the appropriation to $700 million. However, if any proposals are acceptable to the Foreign Affairs Committee, the government may allow them to be introduced. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - The House Democratic leadership has decided to submit the Lend-Lease Act to the Senate today without further concessions. Yesterday, while 66 Democratic congressmen were out for dinner, the amendment proposed by Congressman Sikes, a Republican, on Sunday, giving Congress the right to terminate the Lend-Lease Act at any time, was established. However, the Democratic congressional leadership intends to halt this amendment. The House has voted down, by 185 votes to 94, an amendment arguing that the Soviet Union should not be included among the countries that the President deems to have a defense closely related to the national defense of the United States and that can obtain US military equipment. Later, the House also voted down, by 150 votes to 35, an amendment stipulating that "the cession of territory in the Western Hemisphere is one of the methods for foreign countries to repay American aid." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US House of Representatives last night further restricted by 10% the powers granted to President Roosevelt under the Lend-Lease Act. The House has abandoned the attempt to pass the bill before tomorrow. The House also added a clause to the bill, allowing Congress to terminate the special powers granted to the President under the bill at any time, with the consent of a majority in both the Senate and the House. As for the amendment stipulating that military supplies may not be transferred or sold unless the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army certify that they are "not important" to US defense, it was rejected by 109 votes to 78. The House also resolved other amendments, including one stipulating that the President may negotiate the purchase of all British territories in the Western Hemisphere. The amendment proposed by Congressman Mundt, a Republican from South Dakota, to limit the appropriation to $2 billion and restrict government loans, was rejected by the House.

<h3>US Secretary of War Stimson Refutes Lindbergh's Remarks</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of War Stimson sent a letter to the Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that the sale of American aircraft to Britain would enable Britain to quickly build up its air force, thereby enhancing its hope of repelling attacks and also enhancing the defense of the United States itself. Aviation expert Williams testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, saying that "it is highly doubtful whether Britain can win. Even based on the current war, the destruction of the Hitler regime cannot be achieved without conquering the European continent, but conquering the continent is militarily impossible." He also said, "Not a single squadron of the US Air Force can stand on the European battlefield." Defending British territory and defeating Germany are two completely different things. He cannot say whether Britain can preserve its country, but it is impossible for Britain to defeat Germany. The Lend-Lease Act will weaken the strength of the US Air Force, and the US Air Force is merely a mythical weapon. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - Colonel Lindbergh's accusation that the US aid-to-Britain program is weakening the US Air Force itself was refuted yesterday by Secretary of War Stimson. Stimson strongly refuted the remarks of this famous aviator, saying that the aid-to-Britain program is actually accelerating the manufacture of American aircraft. Lindbergh testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the situation in Britain is now "desperate." He believes that American aid will not be sufficient for Britain to overcome Germany. Former US Minister to Canada and Commander of the American Expeditionary Force in the First World War, MacNaught, also vehemently criticized the aid-to-Britain bill. He believes that the bill is a "war plan" and pointed out that the bill would deprive the Army and Navy of weapons. Lindbergh said, "If we rely on the victory of foreign troops for our security and deprive the representatives of our people of their power, the United States will encounter danger, because the danger to the United States does not come from abroad." Lindbergh continued, "I do not believe it is possible or necessary for Americans to control the outcome of the European war. Any effort by the United States to simultaneously prepare for the defense of Britain and the Philippines is a reckless attempt." (International News Service dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>US Ambassador to Britain Winant to Assume Post in Britain in October; Gauss Has Served in China for Many Years; This Mission to China Will Surely Not Disappoint</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced that the new US Ambassador to Britain, Winant, will assume his post in Britain in October. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday unanimously approved President Roosevelt's nominations of Winant as Ambassador to Britain and Gauss as Ambassador to China. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also unanimously passed the nominations of Wilson as Ambassador to Panama, Dawson as Ambassador to Uruguay, and Muccio as Ambassador to the temporary governments of Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In addition, it also approved Johnson as Minister to Australia, Kirk as Minister to Hungary, Maffitt as Minister to Luxembourg, and Fish as Minister to Portugal. It is believed that the Senate will soon approve the nominations approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - After the US government announced the appointment of Gauss as Ambassador to China, the general reaction was that China now has one of the most capable American diplomats as its ambassador. The Washington Star said that the exchange of ambassadors between China and Australia allows Johnson to get some rest from his hectic life in Chongqing. At the same time, we are not using an inexperienced diplomat as our representative to China, as Gauss has been working in China as a leader for many years. People here generally believe that Johnson, who has been living in a "hot money" environment for a long time, should get a rest to relieve the hardships he has suffered in the wartime capital of China, which is constantly bombed. Gauss has served in various parts of China for many years and has achieved remarkable results, which has been praised by people, especially when he was the Consul General in Shanghai. In less than a year, he was promoted from Consul General to Ambassador, which is rare in the American diplomatic community, but his friends are confident that Gauss will not disappoint. It is said that the Japanese praised Gauss's political achievements in China and gave him special commendations, which is an honor for Gauss. According to "Life" magazine's comment on Gauss's mission to Australia, "He is upright and does not fear people or ghosts." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Eastern Libya Completely Under the Control of British Forces; Italy's Thirty Years of Rule Comes to an End; Fierce Fighting Underway in the Battle for Abyssinia</h3>
<p>London - British military circles claim that the British army's capture of Benghazi, the Italian headquarters in Libya, on Thursday, signifies that the entire eastern territory of Libya is now in the hands of the British army. The British army advanced 160 miles in seven days, with the army, navy, and air force acting together. The navy operated along the coast. At times, the weather was extremely bad, with sandstorms raging. Fortunately, the Italian army's resistance was not very strong. The impact of the British victory is as follows: (1) The enemy has been driven to 700 miles outside Alexandria and 800 miles outside the Suez Canal, making it impossible for the Italian army to conduct large-scale bombing of the British army on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean; (2) Britain has gained an air base to bomb Sicily, Italy (the island is only 450 miles from Benghazi), so the British air force can cooperate with the British fleet's air force in the Mediterranean, and Hitler's plan to use the island to cut off traffic on both sides of the Mediterranean has failed; (3) Italy has lost an important naval port, making it more difficult to supply its troops in Libya, because the British navy constantly monitors the coast from Benghazi to Tripoli; (4) The only way for Hitler to destroy British forces in the eastern Mediterranean is through the Balkans, but even if the Nazis can capture Istanbul, it is still 800 miles from Suez. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A British military spokesman claimed today that since the British army has captured Benghazi, the entire region of Cyrenaica, except for a few isolated outposts west of Benghazi, is now in British hands. People here generally believe that the Italian side had no intention of defending Benghazi. The slight resistance at Derna was probably intended to give the Italian army time to escape. As there is still little news coming from Benghazi, it is not yet known how many of the Italian divisions stationed around the city are left. The British army's occupation of Benghazi not only marks the end of Italy's thirty years of rule over Cyrenaica, but also provides a 3-400 mile stretch of land with very little drinking water, creating an obstacle to prevent the Italian side from attacking Egypt from Tripoli. People here are now focusing on Abyssinia, as all traffic between Abyssinia and Italy has now been cut off since the loss of Benghazi. Important battles are currently underway on the Abyssinian front. The Italian army clearly lacks fighting spirit, and many are surrendering. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent with the South African army in Abyssinia reports that the battle for Abyssinia is underway. A large South African British army has invaded from Kenya and occupied an Italian army's strong outpost in the Gora-hai volcano crater, 20 miles inside the border. The Italian army suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials. The casualties were 30 on each side, and 47 were captured. The South African army was divided into two teams that entered at the same time. The first team aimed to occupy the Italian army's fortified position in the Aare-Algrimmo area, and the second team aimed to occupy the Gora-hai front line. Both tasks were completed on the same day. Aare-Algrimmo was occupied at 4 pm, and Gora-hai fell one hour later. The one that occupied Gora-hai was a young South African soldier, formed a team when the war broke out, never participated in the war, so he lacked experience, but the commander commanded properly, and the soldiers were brave and took the lead, so he had this victory. First, there was a small contact, and the artillery team bombarded the Italian army's trenches and fortresses. Soon, the British army launched an attack, and after a fierce battle of 50 minutes, Gora-hai was captured. The place is an extinct volcano, and the crater has water containing sulfur, and there is almost no drinking water to be found anywhere around it. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A communiqué describing the capture of Benghazi states that the British armored car convoy advanced 150 miles in 30 hours, eliminating enemy resistance along the way and approaching the final line of retreat. The enemy army was shocked by this rapid battle result and was surrounded before it could retreat. Therefore, the enemy armored forces, which were larger in number, supplemented by infantry and artillery, fought hard to break through, but were all defeated and suffered heavy losses. The enemy army finally stopped resisting after 60 of its tanks were destroyed. A large number of troops surrendered, including one enemy general and one corps commander, as well as many other senior officers. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Britain Studies Strategy; Attack on Tripoli</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military commentator said that the fall of Benghazi was expected, but it fell faster than most people expected. The Italian army's resistance in Cyrenaica must have completely collapsed by now. Since the British army's capture of Derna, the Italian army has only engaged in rear-guard warfare once. The British army seems to have no other obstacles except for being tired from the rapid advance. It is now a matter of concern whether the remaining Italian troops in the Cyrenaica region will surrender around Benghazi or attempt to retreat a long distance to Tripoli. If they retreat, they will be harassed and attacked by the British air force, and even ambushed day and night by hostile Arabs along the way. Whether the British army will advance to Tripoli is a major strategic issue that remains to be decided. At that time, the British staff will have to put a lot of effort into organizing supply lines. However, Britain's control of the sea and air in North Africa will provide significant assistance to the army. According to the news received, the Italian side has failed to assemble a large army to defend Tripoli. Under these circumstances, a continued advance by the British army is not overly dangerous strategically and there are many reasons why it must be advanced. Once the British army occupies Tripoli, its benefits will not only have a great spiritual impact on the Italians and the world, including Britain's other enemies, but it will also be important for seizing a good port, which is very important for the British navy's strategy of operating in the central and eastern Mediterranean. The airfield there is closer to Malta and Sicily than any airfield that can currently be obtained, so it is worth occupying. Furthermore, attacking at this moment can at least prevent the Germans from occupying the area, which is also an important goal. The total collapse of the Italian side is not limited to Libya. The British army's attack into Abyssinia has been swift and successful, and since the British army's offensive in Eritrea began, it has captured another 3,500 enemy troops. The Italian army in Africa seems unable to resist for long. Even if they try to defend Keren or Asmara, the British army can also take the two key locations from the south. At the same time, the Greek army in Albania has overcome the great difficulties of cliffs, heavy snow, and dangerous roads, and is expected to attack the more open coastal area soon and capture Vlora and Durrës at an early date.

<p>British Army Wins by Surprise; Establishes Great Achievement</p>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent reports from the British Middle East Command that the British Imperial forces are advancing at an unprecedented rate in North Africa, launching lightning-fast strikes. On Thursday, in the blinding wind and sand, they captured Benghazi, the last stronghold of the Italian army in eastern Libya. It is believed that the Italian army's resistance was minimal. In less than two months since the British army launched its offensive, it has advanced to 400 miles from Sidi Barrani and 100 miles from Alexandria. The magnitude of its victory can be imagined. Today, British troops can be seen coming and going on the palm-lined thoroughfares of Benghazi, proving to the confused residents that the Italian Empire has collapsed. Although the capture of Benghazi was extremely rapid, the British side had already prepared a complete plan for managing the occupied areas. The details will be announced by the special official. Recalling the entire Libyan campaign, British tanks have played a great role, advancing hundreds of miles, breaking through enemy lines, and completely surprising the enemy, causing enemy cities to fall one after another. The British army's advance in Libya not only advanced along the coastal road, which is difficult to travel, but also advanced rapidly along the inland road that crosses the Cyrenaica region behind the mountain ridge. The capture of Benghazi is another great strategic achievement, comparable to the capture of Sidi Barrani. The Italian army initially expected the British army to attack along the coastal roads in the countryside, which are extremely difficult to travel, but unexpectedly, the British armored forces set out from El Merj and advanced rapidly along the arid desert path (these paths are usually only occasionally traveled by camel caravans) for 130 miles, enabling them to attack Benghazi from the east, like a bolt from the blue in the Sahara. The Italian army did not expect the British army to advance so quickly, so it was panicked and unable to resist. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>British Air Force Conducts Extensive Activities in Africa</p>
<p>Cairo - A communiqué from the British Air Force Middle East Command describes the British army's activities before the capture of Benghazi, stating that on Wednesday, British bombers attacked Benghazi, Berka, and Jedabia at night, dropping tons of bombs and inflicting heavy damage. One enemy aircraft was shot down and destroyed. British fighters continued their offensive patrols, strafing Benina airfield, destroying several enemy aircraft on the ground. British aircraft patrolled over Benghazi and did not encounter any enemy resistance. As for Italian East Africa, South African British Air Force squadrons engaged enemy fighters while patrolling near Asmara, shooting down two of them. The squadron also launched an aerial attack on Balda airfield, destroying three enemy aircraft and setting off a large fire in the gasoline depot. Keren was also attacked by British aircraft, with the railway and military buildings being the most heavily bombed. Bombs also fell on the transport yard in Assab. Military targets west of Tobruk in Albania were bombed on Thursday. Ammunition depots and motor transport vehicles were hit by many bombs. The weather was very bad during the air strikes, but the British aircraft suffered no losses. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Frequent Reports of Victory in North Africa; Great Joy Everywhere</p>
<p>Melbourne - Major General Sturdee, commander of the Australian army, who arrived here from the Middle East last month, said today after receiving news of the capture of Benghazi, "This is a great effort. Our army advanced as fast as a motor race, and the elimination of the Italian army was very fast." Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden said that he was delighted by the magnificent victory of the Australian army. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens - A cable from Athens reports that Athens received the news of the British army's occupation of Benghazi with great joy and enthusiasm. People generally believe that the British army commander's use of strategy will enable him to capture Benghazi, the Italian army's extremely important naval and military center, but the Italian army did not expect the British army to advance so quickly. The Italian expatriates in the African cities and towns occupied by the British army have expressed comfort to the British army that went to liberate them, which is of great significance. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>New Delhi - The news of the fall of Benghazi came as a surprise to New Delhi, as people here did not initially know that the British Imperial forces had penetrated so far. Indians are paying more and more attention to the African war because the Indian army has achieved significant results in the African war.</p>

<p>European War Talks (23)</p>
<h3>US Diplomacy Secrets</h3>
<p>The situation changes in an instant. On April 5th, Italy mobilized its troops and invaded Albania, occupying the entire territory within two days. German troops began maneuvers, and Britain and France were deeply concerned that the Soviet Union would take advantage of their unpreparedness and preemptively strike. By April 11th, Italy had called up soldiers born in 1910 and 1914, and seven German divisions had concentrated on the Polish border. At this point, the pessimism of the European situation reached its peak.</p>
<p>The President, as usual, asked the ambassadors stationed in European countries over the Atlantic telephone if there was any way to save the situation. The ambassadors replied as before, "It is difficult to reverse the situation without significant action," and any action was not something the United States could agree with at that time. However, the President was not discouraged and still held onto the hope of using his personal capacity to send a telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, asking them to guarantee that they would not attack other countries.</p>
<p>The telegram was not drafted until the 13th. On that day, the President, Hull, and Welles read the telegram carefully again. Hull believed that the timing for sending the telegram was not yet ripe, but the President did not want to miss the opportunity and ordered it to be sent to Rome and Berlin. The President originally hoped that this decisive appeal could achieve a once-and-for-all result, or at least a satisfactory one. However, the reality was the opposite. After a temporary silence, Mussolini and Hitler replied one after another through speeches. Afterwards, the President also summoned the Italian Ambassador Colonna and told him in a gentle but firm tone that Mussolini's failure to reply in writing was a breach of international etiquette. The State Department also expressed the same regret to the German Chargé d'Affaires Thomson. (To be continued)</p>
<p>In mid-April 1939, the European crisis became increasingly urgent. President Roosevelt and Hull seriously discussed how to deal with the situation. The President still had doubts about the British and French authorities' policy of abandoning compromise. Hull, on the other hand, was more certain and believed that the danger of war breaking out was greater than the President acknowledged and that abolishing the arms embargo could increase the chances of peace. After careful consideration, the President agreed. So the two began to persuade the wavering members of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p>They wasted a lot of breath and only ended up disappointed. The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed an amendment equivalent to rejection late one night at the end of June, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 11 on July 11 to shelve the repeal of the arms embargo.</p>
<p>Despite the unfavorable situation, the President and Hull were not discouraged and decided to convene key senators for a meeting at the White House to discuss remedial measures. The President, as usual, explained the crisis of war to them and made a defense of abolishing the arms embargo. The senators listened for a full hour, and at the end, the President said that he had exhausted his wisdom and strength in mediating peace, and therefore said, "This is my last resort. After this, I will have to start all over again." "Mr. President," Senate Republican leader McNary interjected, "do you think that war is certain to break out between now and the next regular session of Congress?" "I'm not saying it's certain to break out," the President replied, "but I'm sure there's a very high probability."</p>
<p>Hull continued to speak, saying that war would break out in late summer or early autumn, and that abolishing the arms embargo would at least halve the crisis of war. The relationship between the United States and this war was significant. The more he spoke, the more passionate he became, and his emotions became uncontrollable. At first, no one interrupted him, but later, Senator Borah, the old general of the isolationist faction, known for opposing the United States joining the League of Nations, finally couldn't bear it and released his theory.</p>
<p>"No one can predict what will happen in the future," he interrupted Hull, "but as I see it, we won't encounter any war. Germany is not preparing for war either."</p>
<p>"I hope you will come to my office and read the telegrams sent from overseas," Hull replied in a sad and patient tone. "I can be sure that at that time, his conclusion will definitely admit that the danger of war is far beyond what he imagined."</p>
<p>"I don't care what the reports in the State Department say," Borah replied firmly. "I have my own intelligence, and several times I have found that my own intelligence is more reliable than that of the State Department."</p>
<p>After Borah said these shocking words, the whole room was silent. Hull couldn't help but shed tears in his eyes. When someone asked Hull for his opinion again, he said sadly that he could no longer say anything after having been lectured by Borah. Fortunately, Vice President Garner, who had always been an optimist, came out to smooth things over. The President, leaning back on the sofa and smoking a cigarette, had expected from the beginning that this meeting would not have any good results. Despite Hull's sadness, he still calmly replied to Garner that he had done his best, and now the Senate must take responsibility. Borah also interjected that there was "nothing difficult" about this matter, and the meeting ended hastily. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Albanian Frontline: Greek and Italian Troops Engage in Bayonet Combat, Italian Troops Retreat from Tepelene, Corpses Litter the Field, Many Captured</h3>
<p>London - Athens Radio reports: Yesterday, the weather on the Albanian front was still bad. Italian troops, assisted by artillery fire, desperately attacked for two hours without success. A large vanguard of infantry was strafed by Greek troops, corpses littered the field, and they were finally driven back. Greek troops charged with bayonets, pursuing the Italian troops behind the line, capturing many Italian troops and seizing a large number of war materials. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - According to a Reuters dispatch from the Albanian border, Italian troops in Tepelene, an important town in Albania, have retreated. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia - According to news from the Yugoslav-Greek border, Valona on the Adriatic coast was bombarded by long-range artillery from Greek troops yesterday. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<h3>Greek King Inspects Troops at the Front</h3>
<p>Athens - King George of Greece recently went to the Albanian front to inspect the troops. The officers and soldiers of the three services were extremely excited. Many soldiers rushed to the side of his car, shouting the slogan "We will throw the Italian troops into the sea!" The King inspected most of the troops, all the way to the front line. He spoke with the commanders and awarded medals to junior officers and soldiers who had fought bravely. Wherever the King went, he was filled with an atmosphere of loyalty, joy, and enthusiasm.

<h3>British Colonial Secretary: Moyne Succeeds</h3>
<p>London - Former Army Secretary Lord Moyne was appointed Colonial Secretary today to succeed the late Lord Lloyd. He has been sworn in at the Privy Council. Mr. Moyne has held various government positions, including Minister of Agriculture, and has served on several government committees. In 1932, he served as a member of the Finance Committee sent to Kenya, and in 1938, he served as Chairman of the West Indies Royal Commission, traversing all parts of the Empire.</p>
<p>In addition to the news of Mr. Moyne's appointment, other cabinet reshuffles were announced today. Mr. Brown has been appointed Minister of Health, and Mr. MacDonald, who originally held the position, has been transferred to Commissioner to Canada. The position of Secretary of State for Scotland has been filled by Johnston. After Mr. MacDonald goes abroad, he will retain his seat in the House of Commons. Lord Moyne will succeed the late Lord Lloyd as Leader of the House of Lords, with Major Cater as Deputy Leader. The Duke of Norfolk is appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and Major Lloyd George is appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Food.

<h3>Pressure from Germany Forces the Puppet Government to Accept All Demands, Darlan Returns to Vichy to Report on Negotiations, Weygand Denies Tunisia's Cession to Germany, British Ultimatum to Syria Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital - Yesterday, a qualified neutral source here revealed to a reporter from the International News Service the full extent of the demands made by Germany and Italy to France (including Germany's use of the French fleet and naval bases, and the cession of important areas of France and its colonies to Italy). It is revealed that Laval is willing to hand over the entire French fleet to Germany as soon as he gains control of the Vichy government or the puppet regime in Paris supported by Germany. It is also learned that Italy's demands include the cession of Corsica and a part of the French coast west to Toulon, as well as France's full cooperation when the Axis powers attack Britain. It is said that French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain is fully opposed to this demand and is supported by the United States. It is said that the US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, is now in close contact with the elderly Pétain, but powerful elements in the government support Laval. They often want to reach a full understanding with Germany and want to impose a purely fascist government on the country. (International News Service, 8th) Vice Admiral Darlan, the Minister of the Navy of Vichy, went to Paris twice to meet with former cabinet member Laval and the German authorities, and has now returned here today. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy - There has been no change in the French political situation today. No changes are expected until Vice Admiral Darlan returns here from Paris tomorrow night. Vice Admiral Darlan had a meeting with Brinon, the French government's commissioner in the occupied zone, in Paris, and will also meet with Laval, the former cabinet member and foreign minister. The motive for all these talks is that the French government feels uneasy about domestic unity and Franco-German relations. As for the rumors that Germany has made certain demands on France regarding the Mediterranean, they are not true. As evidenced by the statement made yesterday by General Weygand, the commissioner of the French government in Africa, the claim that Bizerte in Tunisia would be ceded to Germany can be refuted. Also, Paris: A newspaper claimed that the British government had issued an ultimatum demanding that France hand over three destroyers and three submarines stationed in the Near East to Britain. Those responsible here are also unaware of this claim, and said that the only French shipping issue in the Near East that remains to be resolved is the obstruction of the French ship "Providence" by the British, but the reasons cited by the British are not acceptable to the French authorities of the Syrian Republic.

<h3>Churchill Scheduled to Broadcast Speech Today</h3>
<p>London - It was recently announced that Prime Minister Churchill will broadcast a speech to the country and overseas on the BBC at 8 pm on the 9th of this month. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Night Raid on the French Coast, Boulogne Ablaze</h3>
<p>London - British bombers soared across the English Channel last night, launching an unprecedentedly fierce bombing raid on the German invasion port on the French coast, dropping various bombs like raindrops. Fires broke out in many places. The center of the attack seemed to be in the Boulogne area, which had also been heavily bombed the night before. Yesterday, the English Channel was shrouded in dense fog, but it cleared slightly at night. British aircraft went on a raid, having to drop flares to find their targets, resulting in a terrible barrage of anti-aircraft fire. Seen from the southeast coast of England, tracer bullets crisscrossed, anti-aircraft shells burst into flames, and the explosions of giant bombs could be heard across the Channel. The sky over the bombed area was illuminated by flashes of light from time to time. An hour after the British attack, two clusters of flames shot out from somewhere east of Boulogne, followed by violent explosions. The doors and windows of houses on the coast of Kent felt the tremors, and soon the sky was red, indicating a large fire. The flames were suppressed by the dense fog in the Channel and could not be seen clearly. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Active Preparations for Municipal Council Election, US Community Presumes Candidates, Allman and McMullen Elected, British and Japanese Residents Will Also Convene Meetings</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council announced that April 2nd and 3rd would be the dates for the next Municipal Council Board election, foreign residents in this city have been preparing to participate in the election. The American Community Association first held a meeting the day before yesterday, according to the seat ratio of five, two, and two for British, American, and Japanese representatives, to presume Allman and McMullen as candidates for the American board members, and agreed on a strategy to cope with the election. As for the British and Japanese Residents Associations, it is said that meetings will be convened soon, but the date of the meeting has not yet been decided, because the Japanese are currently busy with the Residents Group election. It is believed that the British candidates will follow the usual practice of being five in number, while the Japanese were originally two, but since last year there was an ambition to seize five seats, but failed to achieve their wish, this year it seems that a new strategy will be adopted to overwhelm the British and Americans. Therefore, the candidates recommended by the Japanese will still be five. Since the British and Americans are unwilling to give up the directorships and allow the Japanese to control the administration of the concession, the competition this year will be even more intense than in previous years.</p>
<p>Candidate Names Must Be Submitted by Deadline</p>
<p>Danish Consul General to Shanghai and Leader Consul Hill issued an announcement stating, "To all national consulates, according to Article 9 and Article 6A of the Yangjingbang Charter, it has been decided that April 2nd (Wednesday) and April 1st (Tuesday) will be the dates for the election of directors and land committee members for 1941. The list of the aforementioned candidates should be submitted no later than 12 noon on March 25th" to the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Municipal Council at 209 Jiangxi Road, and must not be delayed.</p>
<p>Electoral Roll Being Compiled</p>
<p>The Municipal Council also issued an announcement stating, "Anyone or any firm not listed in the final confirmed electoral roll will not have the right to vote. This list will be published after March 1st and posted in the reception room of the Municipal Council Building at 109 Jiangxi Road and in each police station, and will be distributed to the consulates, foreign institutions, and clubs. Anyone or any firm wishing to be included in the final electoral roll and changing landowners and addresses must notify the Rates Office before March 2nd. All applications after that date will be invalid. If any errors or omissions are found in the preliminary electoral roll published on December 31, 1940, they should be reported to the Deputy Director of the Rates Office immediately."</p>
<p>American Community Presumes Two Candidates</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the American Community Association of this city held a meeting of the Executive Committee on the 7th, recommending Mr. Allman, an American lawyer in this city, and Dr. McMullen, the chairman of the American Community Association and the president of Hangzhou Zhijiang University, as candidates for the next American board member of the Municipal Council. Both gentlemen are well-known in Shanghai. Allman is currently an American board member of the Municipal Council. In last year's Municipal Council election, Allman received the most votes among the American board members. It is said that McMullen's nomination as a candidate must be approved by the authorities of his church. People in this city believe that the church authorities will approve it. It is the first time that an American missionary has been nominated to participate in the Municipal Council board election. It is said that the American Community Association is now suggesting to the Municipal Council that McMullen fill the vacancy left by the American board member Curnow, who resigned at the beginning of this week and will soon return to the United States.</p>
<p>McMullen Highly Reputed</p>
<p>Dr. McMullen, also known as Mingside, belongs to the American Southern Presbyterian Church. He came to China from the United States thirty years ago and engaged in missionary work in Hangzhou. He served as pastor of the Hangzhou Presbyterian Church and executive director of the Hangzhou YMCA. He interacted closely with the Chinese and was proficient in Chinese. Eight years ago, he was assigned by the church to return to Zhijiang University at Zhakou, Hangzhou, as director of school affairs and director of affairs. He was also the pastor of Zhijiang Tangshi (Church). Later, due to the outbreak of war, the school moved from Hangzhou to Shanghai to open. Principal Li Peien asked for leave of absence, and McMullen took over as acting. Since coming to Shanghai, McMullen has been quite active in American community groups. Last year, he was elected chairman of the American Community Association. He is eloquent and humorous. Although he is nearly sixty years old, he is in high spirits. This time, he has the honor of being a candidate for the board of directors, and the American community in this port is deeply gratified.</p>
<p>Formal Suggestion, Date of Annual Meeting</p>
<p>It is also said that the Municipal Council formally suggested to the Shanghai Consular Body yesterday that the annual meeting of foreign ratepayers should be held on April 16. This suggestion from the Municipal Council was given to Danish Consul General and Leader of the Consular Body Hill. It is hoped that formal permission can be obtained at the beginning of next week. Since the Municipal Council board election date has been decided to be April 2nd and 3rd, the expatriate committees of various countries in Shanghai have taken preliminary steps to recommend board member candidates, such as the American Community Association, which held a meeting yesterday. British and Japanese community groups will also meet soon to recommend candidates, but the meeting dates are not yet known, and the exact number of British and Japanese board member candidates to be recommended is also unknown. However, it is generally believed that both the British and Japanese sides will follow the usual practice of each nominating five candidates to participate in the Municipal Council board election.</p>
<h3>Assessor Candidates of Consular Court Presumed, British Consul-General Appointed as President</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has recently received notification from the Leader Consul that the assessor candidates for this year's Consular Court have been presumed as follows: British Consul-General George (also President), Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi, American Consul-General Lockhead, with Lang serving as Secretary.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Police Authority in the Northern District Are Underway, Major Bowan Has Formally Denied</h3>
<p>It is rumored that after the signing of the police agreement for the area outside the boundaries of the western Shanghai, the plan to establish a "new police district" in the northern district is also underway. The new police district, namely "District E," will employ one Japanese deputy police chief and a large number of Japanese police officers. However, Major Bowan, the chief of the police department of the Municipal Council, has denied this statement. It is claimed that he knows of no sign that these negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Curnow Retires and Returns to the United States, Chinese Host Banquet to Say Farewell, More Than Ten Groups Participated in Great Splendor, Seats and Exquisite Souvenirs Presented, Mr. Curnow is Scheduled to Depart from Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The Bank Association of this port, the Silver Coin Industry Association, and the Citizens' Federation, and more than ten other organizations, held a farewell banquet for Mr. Curnow, the Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Council, at the residence of Mr. Guo Shun, the Chinese board member of the Municipal Council. In addition to the representatives of the relevant groups, all the Chinese board members of the Municipal Council, such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, and Chen RuiRui, also participated. Mr. Curnow was dressed in black with white hair, and his spirit was prominent. During the banquet, there was a lot of talking and laughing, and the cups and wine were exchanged.</p>
<p>Recalling the Past, Reluctant to Part</p>
<p>On that day, Chairman Yu Qiaqing delivered a speech, praising Mr. Curnow's career development and spirit of serving the society in China for more than 30 years. Then, Mr. Curnow gave a reply. In addition to expressing his gratitude for the welcome from various agencies, he also described the past, and his words were quite reluctant to part. Finally, Mr. He Dekui, the Chinese Deputy Secretary-General, represented the entire group in presenting Mr. Curnow with an exquisite souvenir worth 500 gold, and everyone dispersed with applause. Mr. Curnow is the general manager of Mobil Oil Company, an American company in this port. He has been in China for more than 30 years, and his footprints have spread almost all over the provinces. He is very kind to others. He has been a director of the Municipal Council for many years, and last year he was promoted to Deputy Chairman. Now, he has retired due to old age and has resigned from his various concurrent positions. It was originally scheduled to return to the United States at the end of last month, but the Chairman Ke Ziwei was injured in the incident at the Taxpayers' Meeting, and Mr. Curnow took over as acting. Now that the official duties have been completed, it is scheduled to take the American President Line's President Cleveland to return to the United States with his family at 8:45 tomorrow morning. At that time, relatives, friends, and old acquaintances will go to the new customs pier to see him off, waving their handkerchiefs to say goodbye, and there will be a feeling of reluctance to leave.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Savings for National Construction Reaches 11 Million</h3>
<p>Savings for national construction through government bonds and savings accounts in the Shanghai International Settlement have been exceptionally enthusiastic. As of January 31 this year, Shanghai's result was 11 million yuan, ranking sixth in the country. It is said that Chongqing was the most, totaling 31.83 million yuan, while overseas Chinese totaled 30 million yuan, and the national total was 110 million yuan. Remote provinces are not included, exceeding the planned target of 110 million yuan.</p>
<h3>President Cleveland Mail Ship Arrives Last Night, Departure Changed to Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The American President Line's President Cleveland mail ship arrived from Hong Kong via Little Luzon last night at around 10:00 pm and berthed at buoys 12 and 13. It is said that there are 116 passengers on board who came to Shanghai, and 144 who are passing through Shanghai to the United States. After the ship arrived, the passenger building company prepared small boats to land at the new customs pier at 11:40 pm last night, and some passengers disembarked this morning. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the United States at 9:30 pm tonight. According to the company's announcement yesterday, due to the large amount of import and export goods, it was unable to load and unload in time, so it could not depart on time. It is now changed to depart at 10:00 am tomorrow morning, and the last trip of the small boat is also changed to 8:45 am tomorrow morning from the new customs pier.</p>
<h3>Inland Postal Rates from Shanghai to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>After the direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo was interrupted, travelers between Shanghai and Zhejiang had to detour through Chuanshan and Hengxi, or detour through Zhapu, through Yuyao and Andong. To go from Ningbo to Jinhua, they had to transfer to Xikou and change to a long-distance bus. The authorities recently stipulated the following transportation fees for Yinzhen, Fengyao, and Taixian Postal Transfers: (1) Yinxian to Xikou, 1.6 cents per 100 catties upstream and 1.6 cents downstream, (2) Yinxian to Baozhuang, 1.6 cents per 100 catties upstream and downstream, (3) Xikou to Genhetan, 3 cents per 100 catties, and then increase or decrease depending on the situation, (4) Yinxian to Hengxi, 2.7 cents per 100 catties upstream and downstream, (4) Yin to Andong, 1.8 cents per 100 catties upstream and 1.6 cents downstream, (6) Yinxian to Tongming, 1.6 cents per 100 catties upstream and 1.2 cents downstream, (7) Yinxian to Baiguan, 1.8 cents per 100 catties upstream and 1.6 cents downstream, (8) Baozhuang to Interconnecting light railway, 1.4 cents per 100 catties for heavy goods, and light goods up to 5 cents in principle, with increases or decreases depending on the size.</p>
<h3>German Ship Passengers Suffer from Infectious Diseases, Detained at Woosung for Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that it has been confirmed that a ship of the Ruilin Shipping Company was quarantined by the Japanese naval authorities outside Woosung, and not detained for attempting to smuggle goods to Shanghai as rumored in this city. According to a Japanese spokesman yesterday (7th), one of the passengers on the ship suffered from a rather serious infectious disease, so it was blocked for quarantine within the previous three days. According to rumors, the ship was carrying 300 bags of sugar and some other goods, and after crossing the Japanese blockade line off the coast of Zhejiang, it attempted to smuggle them to Shanghai and was detained as soon as it arrived in Shanghai. Passengers on board have been released, but the ship will be detained for a long time, as the Japanese authorities have a strict attitude towards ships that illegally cross the blockade line.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Restricts Entry of Travelers, Shanghai Travelers Must Apply for Visa One Week in Advance</h3>
<p>The Dutch East Indies government has also recently issued an order restricting the entry of foreign travelers to prevent undesirable elements from sneaking into the country and engaging in activities. In the future, travelers going to various places in the country must properly handle passport procedures and have them approved by the Dutch Consulate before being allowed to land. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who visited the shipping industry yesterday, travelers traveling from Shanghai to various ports in the Dutch East Indies must, one week before boarding, find a reliable guarantor, pay a passport fee and a Dutch Consulate endorsement fee of HK$28.10, and submit five 3.5-inch photos and a certificate from the Municipal Council's Health Bureau proving that they have been vaccinated against smallpox and typhoid fever, which will be sent by the ship they are traveling on to the Hong Kong company, which will obtain a passport endorsed by the Dutch Consulate in Hong Kong on their behalf before they can travel.</p>
<h3>Three and a Half Years Later: The Soviet Ship Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time, Currently Berthing at the Hefeng Factory in Pudong for Repairs, Scheduled to Sail North with Over a Hundred Passengers</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 8th), a Soviet ship flying the Soviet flag was seen in the Huangpu River. This was the first arrival in three and a half years. The ship is the Smoldy, with a deadweight of 5,300 tons. It is currently berthed at the Hefeng Machinery Factory in the Pudong area for repairs and is scheduled to sail north to Vladivostok on the 25th of this month. It is expected to carry 125 passengers leaving Shanghai, mostly Germans.</p>
<p>Repairs Completed, Sailing to Vladivostok</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Shanghai office of the Smoldy yesterday morning, the ship is currently being repaired in Shanghai because such facilities are not currently available in Vladivostok. This statement coincides with recent reports that the Soviet fleet is extensively using shipyards in various Siberian ports. It is reported that the ship can carry passengers directly to Vladivostok. Many Soviet and German expatriates in Shanghai cannot obtain permission to transit through Japan, and this difficulty will be resolved as a result.</p>
<p>Scheduled Flights: No Confirmation Yet</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired with an official at the Soviet ship's management office about the possibility of establishing regular voyages between Shanghai and Vladivostok, the reply was that no confirmation had been received. However, given the lack of cargo ships from the Far East, some Soviet ships may be transferred to the Chinese coast to transport rice and other goods from South China.</p>
<h3>Various Charitable Organizations Regularly Adjust Refugees</h3>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association's Riddell Case: Voting Results</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Proposal Effective, Rice Market Eliminates Malpractices, Most Foreign Rice Directly Shipped to Shanghai from Origin</h3>
<p>To prevent hoarding and speculation of grain, the Shanghai Municipal Council has approved the Grain Committee's recommendation to submit seven measures to the Rice Market Management Committee for implementation. Upon receiving the news, hoarders rushed to release their stocks, and foreign rice prices fell again yesterday. The proposal has clearly been effective. Although the seven measures appear to be old cases, the Rice Market has adopted various measures, but they are limited to one aspect. The regulations for personnel entering the market, such as firms and customers, are not beneficial to the rice market. Moreover, the intermediaries in the guest market are only recommended by the brokers' association. Therefore, this proposal seeking proper guarantees is different. The requirement that the guarantee must be satisfactory to the Rice Industry Association is also different from previous methods. As for shortening the delivery date from ten days to five days after the rice transaction and paying a deposit of five yuan, it is a supplementary statement.</p>
<p>Stop Rice Trading in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Regarding the trading of rice in the afternoon, it has now been revived. It is reported that the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, aware of its responsibilities, has not remained indifferent. It sent a letter to the Rice Grain Brokers' Association yesterday, severely questioning them and instructing them to notify their members not to sneak into the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange in the afternoon to secretly trade spot rice. If discovered, they will report it to the concession authorities for legal action and permanently refuse to mediate rice transactions. However, futures sold by foreign firms are not subject to the prohibition, but rice brokers who mediate must hold credentials issued by the foreign firm, otherwise, it will also be considered sneaking into the market. The responsibility for illegal transactions by rice brokers rests with the Rice Grain Brokers' Association.</p>
<p>Sea Defense Situation Unrelated to Rice Transportation</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that since the fourth, "Japanese troops have successively landed in Haiphong, and many Japanese warships, including several transport ships, have also been discovered in the waters of Haiphong. It is also said that after the Tokyo Peace Conference ends, Vietnam may allow the Japanese to enter Vietnam." A reporter from the Xinzheng News Agency, in order to clarify whether there would be problems with the source of foreign rice in the future, visited a major rice merchant yesterday. He was told that most of the current sources of foreign rice are shipped directly by sea or by French mail to Shanghai, and only a few pass through Haiphong. Therefore, problems in Haiphong are insufficient to affect the source of foreign rice. However, general rice speculators may take the opportunity to act rashly. All groups responsible for maintaining the people's food supply should pay close attention to this. As for the rice and grain for February that has been approved by the Vietnamese authorities for export from Saigon, it has been shipped to various places as usual.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor's Aide-de-Camp Arrives in Shanghai by Plane, Japan Takes Strict Precautions, Blocking All Bridges</h3>
<p>The English-language "The China Press" reports that Lieutenant General Ban Hasnnma, the Chief Aide-de-Camp to the Japanese Emperor, is scheduled to fly from Tokyo to Shanghai this afternoon (the 8th), and then proceed to Ningbo for a special meeting. Because the aide-de-camp will arrive in Shanghai, the Japanese side has taken strict precautions in the northern district of the International Settlement, and the bridges over the Suzhou Creek leading into Hongkou have been temporarily closed. It is reported that Chen Gongbo has gone to Ningbo today and is expected to participate in the meeting to be held in Ningbo next week. The nature of the meeting is unknown. The Japanese side in Shanghai is keeping silent about the arrival of the aide-de-camp, but according to unofficial sources, the aide-de-camp may be here to personally investigate the situation and return to Japan to report to the Emperor after the meeting.</p>
<h3>Announcer Appointed as Judge</h3>
<p>"The Continental Times" reports that Tiertelburg, who worked as a news announcer at XMHC Radio Station, was formally sworn in yesterday (the 7th) as Deputy Executive Officer of the U.S. Court for China. The oath was administered by Collins, Secretary of the Court. It is learned that Mr. Tiertelburg's appointment to this position was recommended by Li Quesun, Executive Officer of the U.S. Court for China, on January 7, and subsequently approved by the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington via radio. According to the announcement of the U.S. Court for China, Mr. Tiertelburg has gained extensive experience in crime prevention and investigation work in the United States, as well as in criminal, civil, and industrial matters, and is well-trained in technical matters such as fingerprinting and ballistics. He is well-suited for this position.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Not Dredged, Water Flow Rate Doubles Suddenly, Water Volume at Jiaoshan and Madang Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a Japanese military spokesman at a press conference the day before yesterday, the water flowing from the Yangtze River into the canal is now more rapid than before, increasing from one and a half nautical miles to three nautical miles, and navigation is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the narrowing of the riverbanks. However, according to observers, the dangerous conditions of the Yangtze River's water flow are actually caused by the Japanese side not dredging it. According to Jianghai Customs, the water volume of the Yangtze River has dropped sharply recently, especially in the waterways of Jiaoshan and Madang. It is difficult for ships to navigate during low tide. As a result, the water level at Wusongkou has also been affected and is quite low. However, as spring tides are about to rise, the above-mentioned shallow water conditions will not last too long.</p>
<h3>Prison Inspection Committee Appointed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently received a notification from the Consular Body that the members of the committee for inspecting the Shanghai Municipal Council prison for this year have been appointed, including the Polish Consul General, the Portuguese Consul, and the Dutch Deputy Consul. The secretary will still be Mr. Lang.</p>
<h3>Russian Constable Beats and Injures Driver, Arousing the Anger of Colleagues, Public Bus Association Briefly Goes on Strike, Police Promise to Dismiss the Russian Constable</h3>
<p>In front of the Jing'an Temple on the Shanghai-West, the police have set up wooden fences and barbed wire, and stationed Chinese and Western detectives to search passing vehicles and pedestrians when necessary. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a bus No. 1, traveling on that road from west to east, crashed into the barbed wire fence due to careless driving. The Russian constable stationed on the left side stopped the bus and dragged down driver No. 185 on the spot, hitting him violently with a whip, causing his face to bleed profusely. The bus terminal was only a short distance away, and all the drivers and conductors of buses No. 1, No. 2, and No. 7 witnessed the tragic scene and were filled with righteous indignation. They went on strike together. At one point, there were thirty or forty buses parked there. When the company heard the news, they immediately sent staff to negotiate with the police station in charge. After the police chief investigated and found the facts to be true, he promised to dismiss the Russian constable who caused the trouble. The employees then resumed work and restored traffic.</p>

He is 55 years old and resides at No. 50, Willow Grove Villa, Lane 532, YuYuan Road, Shanghai West. He owns a private car No. 2326, with Wang Shunxing, a native of Suzhou, as the driver. Every morning at 9:00 AM, he goes to the Exchange office at No. 422 Hankou Road. Two months ago, driver Wang Shunxing took sick leave, so Ah Er, a native of Nantong, was hired as Wang's temporary replacement to drive the car.</p>
<p>Kidnapped at the Lane Entrance</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:50 AM, Yin walked out of the villa to the entrance of the lane, intending to get into the car. Unexpectedly, four bandits were lying in wait by the roadside. Three bandits, armed with handguns, stopped Yin, threatened him with their guns, and got into the car first. Then, two bandits followed Yin and sat on both sides of him. One bandit forced Ah Er out of the car and drove off quickly, kidnapping both the person and the car. Ah Er stood dumbfounded at the entrance of the lane, watching the car disappear. He ran back home to report to Yin's family, who reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple police station, asking for their assistance in finding his whereabouts.</p>
<p>Car Found</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the police station, considering the case to be a kidnapping, sent officers to investigate the scene and questioned Ah Er. They have already ordered detectives to investigate the matter strictly. Around 9:30 AM, the car No. 2326, which was hijacked by the bandits, was discovered by a patrol officer on Xiaoshadu Road. The police station notified Yin's family to claim it. As of now, Yin's whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Colludes with Bandits, Arrested for Transporting Guns</h3>

The reasons for the arrest and the names of those arrested are unknown.</p>

<h3>Chinese Constable Wounded After Entering Someone Else's Bedroom Without Reason, Defendant Accuses Constable of Adultery with His Wife</h3>
<p>Ding Chengkou, a native of Tongzhou residing at No. 512 Gordon Road, works as a shop clerk in a miscellaneous grain shop, leaving early and returning late every day. The day before yesterday, he returned home at 3:40 PM because he forgot to bring his bicycle light when he left. Unexpectedly, he saw Chinese constable Liu Yongshun No. 2925 walking out of his room. Suspecting improper behavior, he started an argument. Ding immediately held a kitchen knife and slashed at the Chinese constable, causing Liu to be injured in his left arm. Later, Chinese constables No. 1068 and No. 112 arrived and took the injured person to the hospital and took Ding Chengkou, along with the murder weapon, to the Gordon Road police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit for the crime of injury and stated that the defendant was angry and committed the crime because he falsely accused the Chinese constable of improper behavior with his wife. However, according to the defendant's wife, she stated that she did not know the Chinese constable and that there was no improper affair. As Liu's injuries have not yet healed, a request was made to postpone the hearing. According to the defendant's confession, Liu has had an ambiguous relationship with his wife for a long time. He had repeatedly advised him to stop but he would not. He reported it to the police station. When he returned home yesterday, he saw Liu in his room, so he started an argument. The constable held a knife and slashed at him. He was disarmed, and in the struggle, he accidentally injured him. Judge Meng reviewed the confession and instructed the defendant to be held for further questioning of witnesses and rescheduled the hearing for next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Grain: Foreign Rice Sources Remain Uninterrupted, Various Rumors All Disproved, Hoarders' Tricks Exhausted, Hoarders' Courage Gone</h3>
<p>The source of foreign rice in Shanghai continues uninterrupted. Yesterday, the Yihua Shipping Company's Yong Sheng vessel arrived from Hong Kong with 2,826 bags and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Also, the Taikoo Company's Guiyang vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 12,669 bags of foreign rice from Siam, docking at the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. In addition, the Anhui vessel arrived yesterday afternoon and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong. Because it was Saturday afternoon and the office was closed, the exact number of bags of foreign rice loaded on the vessel is unknown and will be reported next Monday. (Zu)</p>
<p>After the foreign rice market turned weak from the prosperous market of the previous dynasty, the market sentiment yesterday was that all the rumors seemed to be castles in the air. Moreover, seeing the reports that the Thai-Vietnamese disputes were about to be resolved and that large batches of sources were continuously arriving, the market suddenly became unstable. At the opening of the morning market, the situation was unusually quiet. Regardless of whether they were local or out-of-town merchants, they all stood by and watched. Although the sellers tried to hold firm, they also followed the wind and changed direction, no longer resisting. The price drop spread frequently. By the middle of the market, each price had fallen close to a yuan. Unexpectedly, the market did not just fail to rise, but the price drop continued one after another. At the close, New Saigon No. 1 resulted in only 82 yuan, falling to 81 yuan, Old 84 yuan, No. 2 79 yuan, falling to 76 and a half yuan, Siamese No. 1, a high of 81 or 82 yuan, falling to 79 yuan, No. 2 77 yuan, Fire twisted 81 yuan, 80 yuan, Small twisted 74 yuan, 73 yuan 7 jiao, Pudong Wharf 72 and a half 72 yuan, Large twisted 72 yuan, Tokyo Pointed 73 yuan, Rice tea 71 yuan to 69 and a half yuan, Broken point a high of 65 yuan falling to 61 yuan. Overall, the above prices are all lower than the previous market by about one and a half yuan. After the short-term futures were sold off by He Yi the day before yesterday, there were more sellers than buyers, and the market was even more unsustainable. The February and March contracts both opened at 87 yuan yesterday, futures 86 yuan 8 jiao to 86 and a half yuan, January 15, 16, 87 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, totaling 5 or 600 tons opened. The spot rice transaction was less than 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice continued, it was not much, but because foreign rice turned weak, the sales market was also sluggish. In addition, the market rumors that the source of domestic rice would soon be restored to normal circulation, the owners' minds relaxed. Therefore, although the resulting selling price on the surface seemed similar to the previous market, in reality, depending on the quality of the goods, it was reduced by half a yuan to one yuan. Special original Japonica from Changbang opened at 106 yuan, sold at 102 yuan, Kunshan original white Japonica 104 yuan, sold at 100 yuan to 96 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice sold at 90 yuan and a half yuan, 94 yuan, original package 97 and a half yuan to 17 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice remained similarly supplied and demanded, with no major gains or losses, but the trend seemed to have turned weaker. The opening price in Hong Kong dollars was still 80 yuan to 78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amid Falling Rice Prices, Flour Market is Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot foreign flour market was particularly dull. After the increase in supply from the sale of flour at fixed prices by Chinese factories, the demand in this street decreased sharply, and the appetite of the guest merchants also became sluggish. Therefore, it was difficult to strengthen the market sentiment. However, there were still guests from Qilu asking about the road goods. Over 10,000 bags of February and March and road goods were traded. The current Australian flour Flower Bird Clock Tower brand mutually vilified each other again in the morning, and the later market slightly opened, with the price being 24 yuan 7 or 8 jiao. The road goods price was 24 yuan 1 or 2 jiao, which was also slightly affected by the spot goods. Because of the falling rice prices, the market was dull and lifeless. Over 6,900 bags of flour were sold at fixed prices by Chinese factories, with no temporary changes, and were all supplied for daily use in this street. The sales of this flour to guest merchants have not yet officially started.</p>
<p>Wheat: There were no transactions in the market yesterday, and the market supply had long been exhausted. Chinese factories also did not pay attention to purchasing. Japanese factories only made sporadic retail sales and slightly increased purchases. The limit price was still around 32 yuan. Foreign sources were still on the way. Under the control of a certain party, it would be difficult to develop inland Du wheat for a while.</p>
<h3>Finance A Weakening Trend Appears in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The underlying cause for the weakening US and British exchange rates in the unofficial market was an excess of supply over demand. The market generally declined, with the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan and the British pound also at 3 shillings and 34375 pence. The market opened in the morning with Japanese firms and speculators dumping currencies, leading to a decline. Later, rumors spread that Japan was about to formally declare war on China. Whether this news was beneficial or detrimental remained unclear, causing significant uncertainty. However, before the noon closing, Chinese banks sold British pounds, bringing the spot price to 3 shillings and 328125 pence. The closing prices were 3 shillings and 34375 pence for the spot British pound and 5.34375 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Dumped First</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's major bonds for both near and distant terms fell by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold prices remained stable. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and Shanghai were flat, while the US dollar was unchanged against the British pound, up two cents against Shanghai, and there was no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 shillings and 328125 pence for British pounds and 5.3125 yuan for US dollars, both unchanged from the previous day's closing prices. After the opening, Japanese firms dumped currencies first, causing the market to weaken. This month's US dollar was favorably absorbed by British banks at a price of 5.34375 yuan. Soon after, speculators also sold, and this month's US dollar was purchased by a certain American bank and Chinese banks, all at an average price of 5.34375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was low at 0.25%. Later, Japanese banks purchased US dollars for February, supplied by foreign banks, at a price of 5.34375 yuan. Subsequently, rumors spread that Japan was about to formally declare war on China, leading to conflicting opinions and uncertainty. At noon, Chinese banks sold some spot British pounds to foreign banks at 3 shillings and 328125 pence. The noon closing was firm, with spot and this month's British pounds at 3 shillings and 34375 pence and the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan. Next month's British pounds were at 3 shillings and 328125 pence and the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, up 0.015625 for the British pound and down 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of refined gold in the unofficial market continued to fall. It once dropped from 6,655 yuan to below 6,600 yuan, reaching a low of 6,590 yuan. In the morning, market sentiment was relatively good, with buyers such as Dafeng, Deji, and Deda. However, the weakening of foreign exchange rates triggered selling pressure, and rumors of Japan formally declaring war on China caused uncertainty and hesitation. However, bullish investors like Xinyuan were willing to sell, causing the price to fall below 6,600 yuan for the second time, reaching a low of 6,590 yuan. The market stabilized at the noon closing, rebounding to 6,612 yuan, down 24 yuan from the previous day. Over 5,000 taels were traded in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The decline in the price of refined gold was due to securities firms and money changers competing to sell. Defu sold 20 taels to jewelry stores, initially at a premium of 75 yuan over the forward price, but later reduced to 30 yuan. Shunyuan sold a total of 110 taels to Xintianbao and Xinfengxiang, at a premium of 45 yuan, and finally 50 yuan. Gold ornaments were down by 10 yuan, while Customs Gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Refined Gold Fell Another Twenty-Four Yuan</p>

<p>Lantern Markets on the Lantern Festival</p>
<p>Lantern markets are frequently mentioned by reporters, but the origin of lantern markets is rarely discussed. This discussion aims to delve into this topic.</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival has a long history, likely originating from Taoist practitioners. It likely formed during the Tang Dynasty and flourished during the Song Dynasty, continuing to this day. Taoism regards the fifteenth day of the first month as the Upper Yuan, the fifteenth day of the seventh month as the Middle Yuan, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month as the Lower Yuan. The Three Officials, namely the Heavenly Official, the Earthly Official, and the Water Official, are in charge of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan. The emergence of lantern markets in the Tang Dynasty does not mean that there were no lantern displays before the Tang Dynasty. As Li Bai said, "The ancients held candles for night游, and there was a reason for it." Holding candles requires lanterns to protect the flame from extinguishing, which is necessary for night游. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that lanterns were used for entertainment at night. Furthermore, the artistic refinement of lanterns, resulting in various shapes and colors, is a natural progression. The Tang Dynasty inherited traditions from the Six Dynasties and embraced Taoism as its ancestor, leading to the popularity of Taoist beliefs. Taoists believe that the Three Officials can bring blessings to humanity, and the tradition of viewing lanterns during the Three Yuan Festivals led to large-scale lantern displays. The promotion by emperors and the enthusiastic adoption by the people, competing for novelty and variety to prolong the enjoyment of the day, is a common human desire, thus giving rise to the creation of decorative lanterns. Decorative lanterns were not easy to make, so there were those who sought them and those who made and sold them, leading to the emergence of lantern markets.</p>
<p>How do we know that lantern markets had already formed by the Tang Dynasty? We can see this from the fact that Emperor Zhongzong and Empress Wei went incognito to view lanterns on the second and third days of the first month of the fourth year of Jinglong. The emperor and empress going incognito to view lanterns demonstrates the prosperity of lantern markets among the people. Why say they flourished in the Song Dynasty? Because after the Tang Dynasty, lantern displays were common on the night of the fifteenth day of the first month when market gates were opened. In the Song Dynasty, the lantern displays were extended to one day before and after the Lantern Festival, namely the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth days of the first month. Later, it was extended to the seventeenth and eighteenth nights, with the thirteenth day being the "lighting day." Therefore, even today, people still regard the thirteenth day as the "lighting night" and the eighteenth day as the "lantern extinguishing night," based on this tradition. During the Song Dynasty's lantern displays, colorful decorations were erected at the main gate of the palace, creating mountain-shaped lanterns. Stages were set up, and the imperial music department performed various plays. The emperor first went to the towers to observe the performances, then went to the towers or the East and West Corner Towers to drink with his ministers. Foreign guests from various countries performed their native songs and dances below the towers. Mountain sheds were erected at the left and right side gates of Donghua, the East and West Corner Towers, the main streets of the city, and large temples and monasteries, with music and lantern displays. Even the city walls were decorated. It was truly a scene of "fiery trees and silver flowers, the city open all night," illustrating the splendor of lantern displays during the Song Dynasty. Emperor Huizong especially added to the splendor, so the lantern viewing scenes described in "Water Margin" are not mere fabrications.</p>
<p>Not only were lanterns displayed during the Upper Yuan Festival, but also during the Middle and Lower Yuan Festivals, which is what is meant by "viewing lanterns during the Three Yuan." For example, the "History of the Song Dynasty" records that during the Middle Yuan Festival in the second year of the Taiping Xingguo era, the emperor viewed lanterns from the East Corner Tower and hosted a banquet for his officials. During the Lower Yuan Festival in the fifth year, the same lantern displays were held for three nights as during the Middle Yuan Festival. Similarly, the biography of Wu Yue King Qian Chu records that during the Middle Yuan Festival, the capital city displayed lanterns, and Emperor Taizong ordered officials to set up lantern mountains in front of Qian Chu's residence and provide musical entertainment to honor him. Such examples are numerous, which is why it is said that lantern displays flourished during the Song Dynasty. During Emperor Huizong's reign, the palace even used dragon saliva and agarwood shavings mixed with wax to make candles, with hundreds of them arranged in rows, shining brightly and emitting fragrance, unmatched by anything in heaven. After the Southern Crossing, this custom was largely discontinued. Only when Empress Dowager Cao returned to the desert and it coincided with Emperor Gaozong's birthday, Emperor Gaozong spared no expense to celebrate, following the example of the Xuanzheng era. However, only dozens of torches were lit, and the Empress Dowager acted as if she did not notice. Emperor Gaozong offered her a cup of wine and asked, "Does this candle please Your Holy Majesty?" The Empress replied, "Your father-emperor used to set up hundreds of them every night, and all the pavilions were the same." From this, it can be seen how extravagant the lantern markets were during Emperor Huizong's reign.</p>
<p>The custom of the Lantern Festival as a lantern festival has continued to this day. During the Qing Dynasty, there were lantern dances and fireworks displays in the West Factory on the Lantern Festival. The emperor would arrive at the West Factory between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM, preceded by equestrian performances by the Eight Banners, such as riding while standing on one foot on the saddle, or riding while standing on both feet on the horse's back, or walking while holding onto the saddle and riding alongside the horse, or two people riding towards each other and exchanging positions on horseback, or one person jumping off and another putting on armor on horseback and riding. Once evening arrived, three thousand people would form a line in front of the building to dance with lanterns, singing songs of peace and holding colored lanterns. They would move in circles, each according to their assigned formation. With one turn, the three thousand people would form the character "太" (great); with another turn, they would form the character "平" (peace), and then the characters "萬歲" (ten thousand years); and finally, they would combine to form the phrase "太平萬袋" (peace and prosperity everywhere). This is what the palace poem refers to as "太平萬賞字當中" (the characters for "peace and prosperity" are in the center). After the dance, fireworks would be set off, the sound like thunder, and the firelight illuminated the sky, revealing thousands of red fish leaping in the clouds, a spectacle unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>According to records, the practice of forming congratulatory phrases in music and dance began during the reign of Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty, in the "Longevity Music" performance. One hundred and forty dancers, wearing golden crowns and five-colored painted clothing, would form characters in their dance formations, changing sixteen times; there were phrases such as "圣超千古" (surpassing the past), "道泰百王" (peace reigns over all kings), "皇帝萬年" (emperor for ten thousand years), and "寳祚彌昌" (imperial throne prosperous). From this, it can be seen that the dance of "Peace and Prosperity" was likely derived from this. (This custom also spread to Goryeo.)</p>
<p>Lanterns are made of paper or silk, with varying degrees of refinement. The lanterns sold in the market include running horse lanterns, lotus lanterns, horse lanterns, rabbit lanterns, crab lanterns, airplane lanterns, painted boat lanterns, and even lanterns shaped like birds, insects, ingots, and coins, in various shapes and colors. However, they are all crude and unremarkable, only suitable for children to play with. In Shanghai, lanterns are typically displayed at the beginning of the lunar new year, on a corner of Fuyou Road and the old schoolyard street, near the Yu Garden, where stalls are set up for sale. Since several department stores on Nanjing Road also sell lanterns, lanterns are also included in the merchandise of large companies. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, the Yu Garden lantern market dispersed, and most lanterns are now made and sold by paper shops.</p>
<p>The construction of the running horse lantern is quite scientific. A reed cover is used as an axle, which is planted in the lantern. On the face of the wheel, paper strips are obliquely bent and folded, radiating from the center to the circumference of the wheel, resembling a white umbrella. A needle is attached to the lower end of the axle, supported by small clam shells, so that it can rotate freely, and it is enclosed in a paper cylinder. Paper cutouts of people and horses are hung on the edge of the paper reel, suspended from the outside of the paper cylinder. A candle is lit inside the paper cylinder, on a horizontal bar at the lower end of the axle. As the candle flame burns high, the air inside the cylinder expands, and with the effect of hot and cold air exchange, it drives the paper wheel on the top cover, pulling the hanging people and horses, causing them to revolve in a circle, hence the name "running horse lantern." One day, Mr. Zhu Zhiyao was talking about the machinery manufacturing industry, and he mentioned the running horse lantern. Mr. Zhiyao said that the recent new-style turbine for power generation is similar in construction to the paper wheel on the running horse lantern. One is used as the driving force for industry, and the other is only a toy for children. The difference in value cannot be measured.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, various syndicates bought with limited prices. The market sentiment was better before the opening, so it opened at 6,650 yuan. Banks such as Huipiao Dafeng and Tiancheng Deda continued to buy, rising another 5 yuan to 6,655 yuan. Subsequently, reports of weakening foreign exchange rates caused many sellers from banks and securities firms to gather, and Xinyuan also sold, causing the price to fall sharply, eventually falling below 6,600 yuan to 6,598 yuan. Thanks to Chengji and Baokang, the price soon rebounded above 6,600 yuan, reaching 6,615 yuan. Unexpectedly, rumors of Japan formally declaring war on China suddenly spread in the market. Although it was difficult to determine whether the news was good or bad, sellers became more eager, and Xinyuan continued to sell relentlessly, causing the price to fall back below 600 yuan to a low of 6,590 yuan. However, spot buyers closed out their positions at noon, raising the closing price to 6,612 yuan, down 24 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 65 yuan in the morning. The selling price of the main brand of spot gold was more than 60 yuan higher than the forward price of refined gold, and the buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There was little activity in current gold bidding.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Also Down 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was initially listed by Datonghang and Xintonghang at 690 yuan, but around 11 o'clock it was lowered by 10 yuan to 680 yuan, with the buying price reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Bond Market Battles Between Bulls and Bears - Market Prices Fluctuate Sharply</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds was highly competitive yesterday, with both bulls and bears actively covering shorts and establishing new positions. Companies such as Xie Kang, Changchun, and Shenchang all had volumes of hundreds of thousands. The market price of Class C bonds suddenly rose to 5.40 yuan, almost a yuan better than the previous day. Unexpectedly, Delonghao and Yundahao, who had bought the previous day, suddenly started selling again, causing the market price to fall back by about a yuan. Then, Hukehhao, Yizhong, and Renchang bought in, causing the price to rebound by 5 or 6 cents. However, Yuxing, Xinfu, Tongkang, Lianheng, Hengkang, and general retail investors sold off, causing the market price to fall back by another 1 or 2 cents. The intense competition between bulls and bears caused the market price to fluctuate wildly, rising and falling sharply. The trend is gradually changing, and the future should gradually improve. Yesterday was the last day for consecutive draws for Class A bonds. Opinions differed on whether the draws would be consecutive or not. It is expected that Class A bonds will stand out after the draw is completed. Class E bonds are the cheapest and are gradually attracting attention. As a result, Class B and D bonds fell slightly, while the rest rebounded by 1.5 to 6.5 cents. The transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>Stock trading: 500 shares of Hanyang Ironworks were traded at a price of 4.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn and Fabric Miscellaneous Brand Yarn Prices Decline Daily Double Horse Still Struggling</p>
<p>The yarn market is flat and lacks momentum. This is due to sluggish actual transactions and difficulties in transportation, so some bullish sentiment has turned bearish, gradually unloading large positions. However, securities firms are mostly holding on, and Double Horse shares are closed, not loosening. As a result, the prices of miscellaneous brand yarns are declining daily due to the cessation of sales, but the market price of Double Horse is still rising independently. The highest price for 20s Double Horse was 1,496 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,481 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with a soft appearance due to scattered sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,486 yuan. As soon as this price opened, the market became even more stagnant. Although the bulls on the trading floor were supportive, the large number of buyers were not aggressive, rising slightly to 1,496 yuan. Then, it was heard that the transaction of real yarn was as light as usual, with very little development. At the same time, the prices of Tiannv, Jincheng, and other yarns declined, and there were few buyers, so the market price turned down to 1,481 yuan. However, the bullish sentiment was very strong, and it rebounded again to between 1,485 yuan, standing for one and a half hours. The intense competition between the bulls and bears can be imagined. The final closing price was 1,488 yuan. The amount of purchases by various syndicates is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Ninety Syndicate 6,450</p>
<p>Statistics 6,535</p>
<h3>Cotton Falls Again</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation continues to decline. This is because yarn is not performing well, sales are stagnant, and the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is even cheaper, so factory purchasing sentiment has turned sluggish. At the same time, foreign exchange rates are rising, and cotton prices are trending downward.</p>
<p>In the New York cotton market, everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the market is flat and stagnant. As a result, the closing price was 1-2 points lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is also weak, still falling due to bullish closures, falling more than 2 rupees yesterday along with forecasts.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, everyone's purchase of raw cotton has not been very enthusiastic recently. Whether it is factories or fellow traders, they all seem to be waiting for opportunities and are unwilling to make more purchases at the moment. As a result, the market has become calm, and large transactions are even rarer. Perhaps the prosperous period will be temporarily separated for a few days.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Stagnant - Selling Prices Fell More Than They Rose</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market weakened yesterday due to stagnant actual sales in the passenger market and the daily depreciation of yarn prices. Sentiment was downstream, sales were chaotic, and transactions were scarce. Some coarse and fine twills of white goods fell by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fugui fine cloth opened in the morning at 44.75 yuan, and fell to 44.25 yuan in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 cents per piece. The street traded more than 300 pieces of various cloths, the Zhelu Yongtai Syndicate bought more than 100 pieces of fine cloth and bleached cloth, the Min Syndicate bought more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill and bleached cloth, and the Yuegang Syndicate's new transactions were very idle.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Dong cloth market fell due to the decline in the yarn market. Sentiment continued to soften, and fine white cloth fell by 5 cents per piece. 12-pound Longtou was now priced at 49.65 yuan at noon. The exchange's current month futures were 50.03 yuan. Although the transaction of colored goods, the Four Gentlemen, and serge was not much, the bottom of the goods turned tight and still sold for 1.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Soybean Cake Speculation Momentum is Huge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market continued to decline due to the soft trend of the previous day. After the mainland Syndicate and the Hong Kong Syndicate slightly had a way to go for the current cakes, the general kick-the-ball operators were creating wind and waves, and the buying sound was higher than everything else. The market atmosphere in the market suddenly showed a tense situation, but as a result, there were more demands than supplies, and the market had no characteristics. It only rebounded by 4 or 5 cents. According to statistics, one truck of Yuanlong cake was traded at a price of 15.30 yuan, and another truck was traded in the lower part of February (the price is detailed in the market price column). Five trucks were traded in the first half of March, and one truck was traded in the second half of March. Fifteen trucks of Feizi cake were traded in the second half of February. One thousand pieces of Lizhi cake were traded in the first half of February, and two thousand pieces were traded in the second half of February. Five hundred pieces of Xingji current cake were traded, one thousand pieces were traded in the second half of February, more than ten thousand pieces were traded in the first half of March, and more than ten thousand pieces were traded in the second half of March.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market fluctuated. The Association's price for spot goods of 24 crude white foreign stacks was 80.05 yuan, 80.08 yuan to 81.00 yuan for the 10th of this month, and then returned to 80.09 yuan, small triangle, 81.16 yuan to 81.19 yuan for the 25th of this month, up 2 cents, and 81.16 yuan to 82.23 yuan for the 1st of next month, up 1 cent. In the afternoon, spot goods were 81.14 yuan, Taikoo Che Bai B Mark was 80.08 yuan to 81.15 yuan, up 5 cents, HX Mark spot goods were 78.13 yuan, and 79.12 yuan for the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Dust New Goods Arrive</h3>
<p>Hongji white coal dust, the raw material for coal balls, was once in short supply, leading to rumors of making balls from smoke dust. After being proven inaccurate, yesterday a certain company's (Melar) ship loaded 6,500 tons of new goods, including 1,200 tons of lump coal and 5,300 tons of coal dust. It is being unloaded and stocked, so the inventory in this city is full, and there is no shortage of raw materials for coal balls.</p>

<h3>This Morning's International Cup Football Showdown: China vs. Portugal, 10:30 AM at Recreation Ground for Quarterfinals; France Plays Judea This Afternoon</h3>
<p>This year's International Cup football tournament, contested by seven strong teams, saw the Chinese team achieve a victorious start last week, defeating England 1-0. Judea won against Russia, and Portugal eliminated the World Team. Today marks the quarterfinals, with China facing Portugal, and Judea playing France, who had a bye last week. The China-Portugal match will kick off at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground on Avenue Albert, refereed by Canal. The Chinese lineup has already been announced, but Li Ning will be absent due to an injury sustained during practice. Zhuang Youren will be reassigned to left back, with Zhang Lingen, previously a reserve, filling Zhuang's position. Examining the overall team composition, it appears quite organized. Defensively, in addition to Qin Biguo as goalkeeper, the two iron gates of Zhang and Zhuang are present. The center-back line may be slightly weakened due to the absence of Liang Shutang and Han Longhai. The forwards have been bolstered by the return of Li Yichen from Shanghai, supported by the agile Sun Tuitui, and led by center forward Dai. Jia Youliang and Wan Jin on the left and right wings provide sharp attacks, capable of intimidating the enemy. The Portuguese team also boasts a strong lineup, with the defenders Victor and Mashan'er, center back Costa, right winger Favansiao, all seasoned veterans and dangerous figures. Oliveira and V. Su Ruo have been selected for the Shanghai Western United Team, their skills improving daily, making their strength formidable. Today's meeting of these two teams is akin to a final. In the last tournament's final, China had their championship title snatched away by a dubious penalty kick. This year, with old scores to settle, the Chinese team will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to defeat the strong opponents and avenge last year's humiliation. Furthermore, the Chinese team has announced that Zhang Lingen was not notified in time. He is requested to gather at 9:30 AM this morning at the Donghua Association on Route Lafayette after seeing this notice. The other quarterfinal match of the International Cup, Judea vs. France, will be held at 2:30 PM at the Racecourse. In addition, there are two league matches: Group B Yosheng vs. Russian Overseas Chinese, and Group C Huamao vs. Witoring. Today's schedule is as follows: China - Portugal (National) 10:00 AM Recreation Ground; Judea - France (National) 2:30 PM Racecourse; Yosheng - Russian Overseas Chinese Association (Group B) 3:00 AM Aurora University.</p>

<h3>Confirm the Plan</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>— Written at the Start of the School Term —</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, the two-week winter vacation has mercilessly ended, and since last week, every child has returned to their normal school life. At the beginning of this school term, I want to remind the children of one thing: confirm your study plan for the next six months. Every child should not overlook this and should put it into practice.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "A year's plan starts in spring, and a day's plan starts in the morning." We can say that a semester's study plan starts at the beginning of the school term. Nothing in the world will succeed without a plan, and the same is true for our studies. Therefore, at the beginning of this school term, the most important thing is to confirm your plan. The sages tell us that "preparation ensures success, lack of preparation ensures failure." The so-called "preparation" means determining the plan in advance and then doing things according to the plan. Then, no matter how difficult things are, they can be done successfully. Conversely, if you do something without a plan beforehand, there will be no hope of success.</p>
<p>Understanding this point, you can see that if we want to make considerable progress in our studies in the next six months, we must first confirm a study plan. For subjects that were relatively poor in the past, we should double our efforts this semester. For those that are relatively good, we must not be complacent and neglect them. Set aside a few hours each day for extracurricular work. When to write? When to read? What books to read outside of class? How many books to read each month? Which books to read? What articles to write? When to write a diary? Everything must be planned and listed on a study plan.</p>
<p>However, finally, there is one more particularly important point, which is to be able to actually implement it. Once the study plan is confirmed, you must read and write every day, every month, according to the items listed on the table. Otherwise, if the plan is determined at the beginning of the school term, but not followed after the start of school, it is exactly the same as having no plan, and it will not be effective. Therefore, once our plan is confirmed, we should proceed according to the plan in everything, and then there will be considerable progress in the coming semester.</p>
<p>He was inspired by a region, a feeling of grief and indignation. He worked hard to encourage himself, secretly uniting the people of the country, plotting to launch a revolutionary movement to restore Siam's national glory. As a result, after three decisive hard battles, Siam was revived in the hands of Zheng Zhao. After losing the land was recovered and national humiliation was wiped out, how grateful should those Siamese people be to Zheng Zhao? Zheng Zhao became the first king of Siam under the support of the people. After this, he also revived until he conquered the entire Burma with the Qing Dynasty's coalition forces.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhao had no sons, so he adopted a Siamese local named Hua Ce Geli as his adopted son, and later married his daughter to him. After Zheng Zhao's death, Hua Ce Geli inherited the throne. As these times continued, it became present day Siam. Our ancestors did that to become Siam's benefactor, but Siam treats us overseas Chinese with such abuse! What is the reason for this? Children, please study it carefully.</p>
<h3>The Result of Eating Too Much During the New Year</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>After spending a lunar New Year, A-Liang's stomach was full of greasy things, like braised pork, cured meat, etc. These were not easily digested for a while, so they accumulated in his stomach and intestines, causing his appetite to decrease. His rice intake decreased from two full bowls to the point where he couldn't even finish one bowl, and his bowel movements were also abnormal. He told his mother about all of this during mealtime.</p>
<p>"This is because you ate too much greasy food and other sweets and snacks! From now on, you must eat less and eat more vegetables, and you'll be fine soon," his mother muttered to him.</p>
<p>"What's the reason for this?" he asked his father at the table more carefully.</p>
<p>"When greasy meat is eaten, it takes a relatively long time to digest. If you eat too much, the stomach and intestines don't have time to digest it all at once, so it accumulates, causing a decrease in appetite. Food is a very important thing, as it can help with growth, maintain health, and provide the power for activity, but this refers to normal food. If you eat too much, it will not only be useless but also cause stomach problems. Therefore, everyone should eat according to their own stomach. Eat to moderation, and don't eat only one or two kinds of food. Some people like to eat meat but don't eat vegetables; others like to eat vegetables but don't eat much meat. This is also not right. You must know that everyone should adapt to the environment, follow habits, and freely choose food, so that the nutrition will not be lacking. Therefore, you should pay attention to the food that must provide the necessary amount of nutrients, protein, minerals, and various vitamins. In other words, no matter vegetables or meat, don't be picky, and eat everything that is necessary. This is because vegetables are rich in minerals, and meat contains more protein and other vitamins. The purpose of our food is not to eat how delicious they are, but to absorb the nutrients in them that can sustain life, and the deliciousness is just to cause us to want to eat them. Your indigestion in the past few days is of course the result of eating too much, so you should eat less for now and let your stomach get hungry, because being hungry is a good thing. You should never eat desperately when your stomach is hungry. From now on, when you eat, you should pay attention to trying every dish on the table. In addition to three meals a day, all other snacks should be quit, and you will never have this kind of indigestion again."</p>
<p>the method to keep the water from flowing away, so they build dams. Their teeth are very powerful. They bite a small tree all around the base, making it thinner and thinner until the tree falls over on its own. Then they bite off all the branches and drag them into the river, submerging them and burying them in the mud at the bottom of the river to secure them. They weave the bitten-off branches into a dam, piling mud and stones on top. Their tools are their mouths and two front feet. Because there are many workers and they are earnest, they soon achieve remarkable results. Then, relying on the sand and debris flowing in the river, they accumulate it, making it thicker and thicker, and the thicker it is, the stronger it becomes. If they are willing to open a gap in the dam to allow the river water to flow smoothly, that would be good. Otherwise, when the river water is blocked by the dam, it will flood both sides of the river, often causing disasters and washing away houses and fields. Therefore, beavers are actually harmful animals.</p>
<h3>The Master of the Lolo Restoration</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>At this time of extreme tension in the Vietnamese situation, we see news about Thailand on the newspaper from time to time, this is not within the scope of this article, let's not talk about it for now, Thailand is Siam; let's go back to the history of the restoration of Siam, briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Siam was once destroyed, but it was the Chinese Zheng Zhao who cleaned up the mess for the destroyed Siam and rebuilt the glorious history.</p>
<p>During the Qianlong era, there was a person named Zheng Zhao from Chenghai County, Chaozhou, Guangdong, who drifted with his father to Siam at a very young age. They lived there for decades, and this Zheng Zhao became the prime minister of Siam.</p>
<p>Siam and Burma are two countries with age-old feuds. During the Qianlong reign, the Burmese king led his troops to attack Siam, defeating the Siamese soldiers and occupying all the land. They also annihilated all the surviving members of the previous king's family. At that time, Zheng Zhao was already over fifty years old. He had long since resigned from his official position and lived in seclusion in a very remote place in southern Siam. After the country was in turmoil, although he was old, his ambition was not diminished. Watching the beautiful mountains and rivers become different countries,</p>
<h3>Children's Words</h3>
<p>— San San</p>
<p>Child A: Where were you born?</p>
<p>Child B: I was born in the hospital.</p>
<p>Child A: Ah, what sickness did you have?</p>
<p>Teacher: Everyone must remember to walk on the left side.</p>
<p>Student: Teacher, that's not right. Those coming walk on the left, and those going also walk on the left. Wouldn't everyone bump into each other?</p>
<p>Teacher: Why are you late again? It's like this every day.</p>
<p>Student: I walk slowly!</p>
<p>Teacher: Why don't you walk faster?</p>
<p>Student: Many of the road signs on the road told me to do so.</p>
<p>Teacher: How so? What road signs did you see?</p>
<p>Student: "School Ahead, Walk Slowly!"</p>
<h3>Beavers with Architectural Skills</h3>
<p>— Fang Heng</p>
<p>Children may not be very familiar with the name "beaver." Yes, their homes are very far from us, in North America! So I must first introduce their appearance and then talk about how they build houses and dams.</p>
<p>Because they love to bite things, like rats and rabbits, animal researchers classify them as rodents. The large ones are two feet long, and the head is a bit like a rat. The strangest things are the tail and hind feet. The creator gave them a flat, scaly tail like a small oar and webbed hind feet for easy swimming. When swimming, the hind feet paddle, and the tail becomes a rudder. Not only can it be used as a rudder, but it can also be used as a chair. When eating or biting trees, they sit on this chair. They like water,</p>
<p>So their homes are always in the middle of the willow trees by the water's edge. They dig two holes in the ground, leading straight to the bottom of the river, like a tunnel. This is the entrance and exit, and they also use this tunnel to go to the bottom of the river to find their food.</p>
<p>They build houses right above the underground holes, building them very well, like a small fortress. The materials are branches, mud, and small stones. They collect these materials and use their innate architectural genius to build them quite solidly. The interior is also very elegant, with carpets and mattresses woven from thin branches and tender leaves. Beavers enjoy their family happiness here.</p>
<p>Beavers love water most, but in winter, the river will be shallow and dry, so they think of</p>

<h3>The Future of the Old Female Role</h3>
<p>— Gu Mei</p>
<p>In Yuan dramas, old female roles were sometimes played by painted-face characters. In Kunqu opera, it's a clown's job. Peking opera often has elderly male actors portraying them. In the north, Xie Baoting and Zhou Changshan both played elderly roles while also being elderly characters. The only true old female role specialist was Gong Yunfu. After Gong, there was Wolun Jushi, Chen Wenqi, Wen Rongshou, and Li Duokui. In addition, Zhu Guifen (pictured), Wang Xiaonong, Liu Hongsheng, and Wang Fengqing could all perform old female roles. In the south, in the past 20 years, besides Fu Xianfang, Zhao Junyu, Mao Yunke, and Lü Yueqiao could all play old female roles. Now, the older generation has passed away one after another. The younger generation either practices elderly male roles or learns flowered shirts. Some have voices but not appearances, singing for painted face roles and little flowered face roles. The old female role has become a neglected art. In the past decade, there's only been one Li Duokui in the north who still has some old female role flavor, but she can only sing and not act. Although Wen Liangchen was good at acting, he had no voice. After Li Duokui and his qin player Lu Wu broke up a few years ago, her tone was not as good as before (Lu was originally Gong Yunfu's qin player). Wen Liangchen also died last year. Taking the best of the short, there's only Sun Futing. Sun is not as good at acting as Wen Liangchen, nor can she sing as well as Li Duokui. Now, there's a Ma Lüyun, who once partnered with Jin Shaoshan to sing "Broken Empress Dowager." Besides her voice, her mouth, body, and tone still need to be greatly studied. Zhang Jufang, He Shengqing, and Huang Jin's Zhang Shengyu and Li Jinquan, who have sung in the new era, are all inferior.</p>
<p>The south doesn't produce old female roles, but it does produce male martial roles who play old female roles. Like He Yueshan, Yang Ruiting, and Ying Baolian. There are a few supporting old female roles, such as He Runchu and Liu Zhenting. Therefore, Zhang Shaoquan, a female elderly male role who changed careers, has become the Li Duokui of the south. Now, her daughter is debuting (that is, the movie star Li Lihua), but with a weak body, Zhang Shaoquan is not as good as she was three years ago, when she could sing and act to support half the country south of the Yangtze River. If you want to hear old female roles performed alone in the south, it will only happen with Yang Ruiting's cross-dressing.</p>
<p>Old female roles in the north now follow the Gong Yunfu style. In the early years, the south mostly followed Wang Guifen. When Guifen was in Shanghai, she liked to sing old female roles, so Yang Ruiting, Wu Guifen, and Sun Guifen mostly followed the Wang style in their singing. Zhao Junyu also hummed a few Wang tunes in private. Lü Yueqiao and Mao Yunke had more Shen components. Now, many of those who cross-dress as elderly roles are old, and those who learn old female roles are dead. Apart from a few who don't have the right tone or appearance but can be considered old female roles, the big troupes are all clowns and elderly male actors playing the roles. In the north, there's Ma Fulu in Ma Lianliang's troupe and Li Baokui in Li Shaochun's troupe. In the south, there's Li Changshan at the Carlton and Chen Jufang at Huangjin. Zhang Guifang at the Grand Stage is also very good. In the near future, the old female role profession will undoubtedly be eliminated and will return to the old practice of being played by elderly male actors and clowns. Shou Wu</p>
<h3>Scattered Notes from the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Since "Frontier Storm" is set in the frontier, the location shooting team has been there once. Now the costumes and props for the film purchased from the frontier have arrived in Chongqing. The interior scenes will be shot immediately. At that time, the studio will be a scene of frontier scenery.</p>
<p>It is said that Minhua's second big film, "Children of the World," will only begin filming after the complete scripts in Chinese, German, and English have been finished. There are four or five important roles in the film. Zhang Yi and Lan Lan have been decided, and the remaining roles will be filled with new talents as much as possible.</p>
<p>It is said that the Hong Kong Xinsheng Company, under the leadership of Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin, and Tan Youliu, has organized reading groups, etc. According to Cai, this is to "make up for congenital deficiencies." There are also weekly seminars, which carpenters, workers, and tea attendants all attend. Since its inception, it has been very beneficial.</p>
<p>It is said that Cao Wan's "Transformation" is about various things in the rear hospital for wounded soldiers. Therefore, the Shanghai audience during the "isolated island" period will probably not have the fortune to see the play on stage.</p>
<p>Gu Zhengqiu, a student at the Shanghai Drama School, is very small, but when she dresses up, she looks like a female elderly role. This person is very photogenic, very much like Yuan Meiyun in her early days as a female actor. If you don't believe it, there's a picture as proof.</p>
<h3>Cao Yu's New Work, "Peking Man," Finished and Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>When Cao Yu was in Shanghai, he promised the Shanghai Drama Society to write a script. The play was named "Peking Man," but after writing one act, he stopped writing and completed the two plays "Transformation" and "Thinking." Except that "Thinking" has been performed by the Shanghai Drama Society, "Transformation" cannot be performed due to environmental reasons. It is heard that the play "Peking Man" has been completed and will be sent to Shanghai soon. The Shanghai Drama Society will of course rehearse it immediately. As for Cao Yu's other work "Competing for Strength," the Drama Society will perform it after "Lying World."</p>
<p>The play "Thunderstorm" caused a sensation and attracted countless audiences after its first performance, winning praise from all walks of life. As a result, the reputation of the China Travel Drama Troupe has also become increasingly popular. It has been deeply supported by the general audience until now. Recently, China Travel has rehearsed "Thunderstorm" again, so each theater troupe has also risen and rehearsed "Thunderstorm," which shows the value of "Thunderstorm." However, after this play has been performed for so long, a question has always floated in my mind: the age issue of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>The ages of each person listed in the script:</p>
<p>Zhou Puyuan - 55 years old</p>
<p>Zhou Fanyi - 35 years old</p>
<p>Zhou Ping - 28 years old</p>
<p>Zhou Chong - 17 years old</p>
<p>Lu Gui - 48 years old</p>
<p>Lu Shiping - 47 years old</p>
<h3>The Age Problem in "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huiyu</p>
<p>Lu Dahai - 27 years old</p>
<p>Lu Sifeng - 18 years old</p>
<p>The above ages are all 30 years later. Then, let's calculate their ages 30 years ago according to the table. Zhou Puyuan should be 25 years old, and Lu Shiping should be 17 years old. Then how old should Zhou Ping and Lu Dahai be? This is the age problem that I suspect.</p>
<p>Zhou Puyuan and Lu Shiping separated for 30 years, starting from when Shiping ran away with the newborn Lu Dahai. At this time, Zhou Ping and Lu Dahai had already been born, but Zhou Ping was one year older than Lu Dahai. According to this calculation, Zhou Ping should be at least 31 years old, and Dahai should be at least 20 years old. The ages in the character table are 28 years old for Zhou Ping and 27 years old for Lu Dahai. This is a truly puzzling question. Although the problem is not important, it will become a joke if you don't pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: The age problem of the characters in the play "Thunderstorm" has been discussed before. This is just like the heroine in "A Year's Time" giving birth to a child after 12 months of pregnancy. It's just an occasional oversight by the author. The theater troupes may wish to correct the age when performing in the future.)</p>
