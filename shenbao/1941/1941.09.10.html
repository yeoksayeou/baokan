<p>社評</p>
<h3>列寗格勒的爭奪戰</h3>
<p>依照這兩天國際觀察者的多數意見，蘇聯列寗格勒的形勢，大體已在緊急與危險之中了。當然，這僅僅是指牠對外幾條交通綫的危急情形而言，或者最多限度，也不過是指出牠有着被陷入圍困的危險；而絕不是說，蘇聯也許為了感到犧牲的慘重，及所受壓迫的緊急，最近將不得不考慮自動由該區的撤退，當然更不是說，德軍在最近的將來，就有一舉而擊潰的守軍，佔領該地的可能。</p>
<p>目前列寗格勒所受壓迫最重的，是西北與西南兩角。至於牠的東北兩正面，德軍固然一時無法衝到，即使牠牠東南角與莫斯科之間的交通綫，德軍雖已進攻多日，但短期間內，還是沒有加以切斷的可能。假定德軍能夠繼續最近這樣猛烈的攻勢，而不被蘇軍反攻擊退的話，那末，牠也許終於可以切斷莫斯科到列寗格勒的鐵道，然後向西北角上派出一支大軍，展開一個鉗形運動，再進而切斷列寗格勒與伏羅格達之間的鐵道交通。那時候，列寗格勒對外的交通幹線，就是宣吿完全被斷，而受到德軍的四面進攻。可是値得指出來的，縱使德軍佔據了牠的所有對外交通要道，離圍困還是差得很遠。象列寗格勒軍區那樣廣大的原野地面，再加上內有百萬大軍的固守，外有全體紅軍的策應，德軍要想使牠陷入重圍，內外不通水洩，然後慢慢環攻而加以消滅，那眞是談何容易！以目前配備於北路的德軍而論，如不大量增加兵源與戰具，這一舉，無論如何，是絕對不可能的；而且反過來，對於量的方面居於劣勢的攻擊者，這種圍困企圖的進行，却倒是一件非常危險的事。</p>
<p>德軍現在拼命進攻，想於冬季到來前佔領列寗格勒，暫且在北路方面，取得一個比較具有決定性勝利的企圖，是非常之明顯的。可是蘇聯方面，也不可不全力固守，或甚是準備孤守的，這其中，也有着許多非常重大的意義。首先，假如列寗格勒失守，蘇聯全綫的形勢，就要受到重大的震動。莫斯科的受到威脅，恐怕還算比較次要的事，而最重要的，那時蘇聯為了穩定自己的形勢，即使在中路與南路，勢也不得不考慮調整陣地，而全綫向後轉移。許多重要的工業地帶與軍事要點，也就要因之失去了。其次，在這莫斯科三强會議即將舉行的時候，蘇聯對於自己的軍事威信，在任何代價下，似乎都有加以保持的必要。最近這一區域的天空，正在進行着德，蘇大規模的空戰。對於制空權的保有，蘇聯尚且用盡力量，加以爭取，那末，何况關係到蘇聯全軍威信的，列寗格勒軍區的爭奪！這一爭奪戰役的成敗，對於三强會議的結果，是有着非常重大影響的。再次，蘇軍的固守列寗格勒，對於牠的整個後方，實在是盡了重要的屛蔽作用。列寗格勒一天不失守，德軍一天就無法向莫斯科進攻；否則，德軍在佔領列寗格勒之後，牠就可以向莫斯科展開一個鉗形運動，那時的形勢，方是眞正的包圍與殲滅戰的形勢。所以蘇聯無論如何，北路必須在列寗格勒堅守，縱使即行與德軍舉行大規格的決戰，大概也無法顧惜的。</p>
<p>因之看起來，德軍要想取得列寗格勒，除掉以軍事力量，澈底擊潰蘇軍外，實在別無他法；要想以包抄壓迫蘇軍，合牠自動撤退，是絕不可能的。蘇軍在南路與中路，自從開戰以來，者曾略有後退，而北路因地理關係，幾乎一開始就以爭奪列寗格勒的方式出現，使蘇軍無法退後。所以統計起來，德軍的進展地面，也以這一路為最少，列寗格勒不獨是一個重要的口岸與工業交通重心，而且，也是蘇聯最重要的堡壘之一。牠對蘇聯全國的重要性。要遠過於基輔，奧迪薩，明斯克等地，而僅僅次於莫斯科。</p>
<p>那末，德軍是否有以軍力攻下列寗格勒的可能呢？這，一方面固然要決之於德軍進攻的戰略與實力，而另一面，尤其要決之於蘇軍防守的決心與方針。列寗格勒軍區內，蘇聯現在集中的力量，大概已超過了百萬，而一切的器械與給養，縱使一時與外面斷了聯繫，短時期內，大約也可以自給自足，不成問題。南路奧迪薩至今的孤守，已經充分證明紅軍有從事更大規模孤守的能力與決心。何况，這回蘇軍的最高戰略，又似乎是以攻為守。那末，假定德軍圍困列寗格勒的可能一加緊，那時候不獨在這一地區的外環，蘇聯要增援反撲，對德軍形成一個更大的包圍；即使南路與中路的蘇軍，也就要同時更大規模地出擊，使德軍無法再集中力量，專攻列寗格勒。</p>
<p>最後我們要指出的，德軍全綫第三次攻勢的衝擊力量顯然每天都在衰减之中，北路當然也並非例外。除非德軍以大量生力軍及大量武器增加上去，大概在冬季以前，列寗格勒的爭奪戰，始終不會脫出拉鋸戰的相持狀態。</p>

<h3>華商銀行傾心合作　均準備經營外匯　中交兩行籌劃實行步驟　事實上與友幫銀行一致　九月份特准經營外匯銀行試行辦法發表</h3>
<p>爲管理上海滙市而頒定之必需品進口給滙辦法、由十四家友邦銀行通力合作一致實行後、紊亂已久之上海貿易局面、顯已回復正常、向爲投機淵藪之外滙黑市、亦吿戢止、但在中國國家銀行方面、對於此事、極守緘默、惟據新聲社記者昨日探悉、四行中之中國交通兩行（中央及農民兩家、向不經營外滙、由中交集中辦理）、正在籌備與十四家友邦銀行採取一致行動、對必需品之外滙、得代客向平準基金會申請核給、同時收賣貿易商之出口滙票、至華商銀行外滙業務、於上月十五日軋平、由中央銀行代爲收解淸楚後、本不能繼續經營外滙、茲經平準會特准、亦得轉由中交兩行向平準會申請外滙、從中取得〇三一二五之佣金、刻各華商銀行正與中。交接洽之中、但四行當局對於接到平準會由總行轉來之命令一事、旣未證實、亦不吾認、唯事實上、四行現所進行者、爲十四家外商銀行遵照平準會所令採取之措施、完全無異、</p>
<p>華商銀行　一致行動</p>
<p>中國國家銀行及華商銀行之將取一致行動、以由平準基金會之通吿證之、此一通吿、乃前日下午所發、除宜稱平準會議之目的、在會晤英美銀行代表、以便對英美政府凍結辦法所引起之最近發展、交換意見外、又力言英美銀行界決定按照平準會滙率買賣外滙、而華商各銀行亦允傾心合作、該通告末謂、所商妥之辦法與諒解、已有確實之進步、英美財部亦將儘力合作、俾平準會得獲與英美政府凍結法令有關之消息或情報、且美政府將特派人員駐中國及香港、辦理此事、昨日本埠中外銀行對於平準會之決議與通吿所述、竭誠歡迎、無不決心遵照當局命令、以加强上海外滙管理之機構與實施效率、</p>
<p>管理匯市　僉表擁戴</p>
<p>在華方銀行部份、因准同樣通過中交兩行經管外匯買賣、故對於外滙管理之實施、亦表擁戴、緣華商銀行之外匯業務、於上月十五日軋平、由中央銀行代爲收解淸楚後、因無美政府之特別照會、故不能再買賣外滙、但依照新規定、各華商銀行仍得代客轉由中交兩行向平準基金會申請法定外匯、而取得原應由中交兩行獲取之佣金〇三一二五、凡進口商向各華商銀行請求供給外滙者、須先塡申請書之有關各項、由原經手銀行彙交中國或交通、由中交塡寫保證一項、然後送達平準會、在此種塲合、進口商向原經手華商銀行負責、華商銀行向中交負責、中交向平準會負責、如平準會隨後發覺申請不符條例、但外滙已核給者、得飭最接近之負責銀行追回已給之外滙、</p>
<p>套匯套利　無法實現</p>
<p>上海外匯管理辦法實行、美英凍結令之漏罅、漸趨彌補、在此條件下、黑市外滙固將消聲斂跡、而任何方面之套滙舉動、勢將無法實現、此法顯可防止中國資金之無謂外流、但對於正當合法之進口貿易、自無影響、至套利一事、素爲投機市儈注意所在、利用現貨與期貨或各月期貨間之差額謀利、而今在平準會統制下之滙率、當然不致有此差額、即目前有行無市之黑滙、因平準會與各銀行之努力、此種給予投機商良好機會之差額、亦不復存在、如以咋日之黑滙而論、英滙現貨及期貨價格均爲二辨士八五九三七五、美滙現期貨價因爲四元八四三七五、此種套滙與套匯之禁絕、必將予整個滙市以安定之影響、</p>
<p>黑市尙圖　敬延殘喘</p>
<p>關於上海黑市外滙問題、猶能獲得多數人之注意、而昨日外傳「今後黑市將由出口商與進口洋行互商一執中價買賣」之說、此僅爲一般企圖黑滙苟延殘喘之投機商人所佈空氣、唯據關係銀行人士談、此舉難能實行、蓋黑市之所以生成、在買方爲進口商之扒吸、在賣方爲出口商之拋出、而今平準會一方面規定供給必需品或小額貿易進口之外滙、則進口商自無再向黑市扒吸之必要、另一方面、又規定出口商必須將出口滙票結售於十四家友邦銀行及中交兩行中之任何一家、否則拒絕給予進口外匯、因此出口商爲維持在進口時所能向平準會獲得外匯之權利、自不願將出口滙票向黑市拋出、職是之故、黑市之戢止消滅、自極合理、而一般投機商人之亂放空氣、徒見其心勞日絀而已、惟滬市情形特殊、將來禁止進口物品及非必需品奢侈品等之運入、其結滙手腕如何、又當別論、固與向來外滙黑市之投機行爲性質不同、且旣有法定外滙之標準、自難越軌行動也、</p>
<p>霍金士麥　凱今返滬</p>
<p>奉如自滬赴港參加平準會議之麥加利銀行總經理霍金士·及花旗銀行監事麥凱、茲以在港會議竣事、已於前日搭美國總統郵船公司克利扶輪號返滬、預計今日上午可以抵此、霍金士氏乃上海外商銀行公會會長、此决奉召赴港、代表外商銀行表示意見、並答應按照平準會滙率買賣外匯、關係各方僉表擁戴、麥氏則爲美商銀行領袖、自亦有相當勢力、雨氏茲聯袂返滬、對於上海匯市、將有更實際之貢獻、殆無疑義、至先兩氏赴港之平準會美幫辦泰萊博士、及繼兩氏離滬之英委霍爾巴樞、以尙須留港與美委福克斯商討各項問題、故短期內不致再來滬、</p>
<p>試行辦法　聞已頒佈</p>
<p>聞平準基金委員會昨叉授權麥加利銀行、發表一九月份特准經營外匯銀行試行辦法、」內詳載准給進口商外匯及個人申請外匯辦法、該辦法內、並載有週一所公佈之二物品清單、此類物品之進口、可由本埠特准或特許銀行、向平準會請給有限額之美匯或英匯、該試行辦法、載有一條、規定各銀行祗照法定匯率結匯、不得直接或間接、經營其他匯率之買賣、該辦法所載物品、淸單甲、規定食米·姻葉·石油產品·及煤、均受某項限制、當以本市需耍量爲限、淸單乙、所載物品頗多、（註有一九三四年海關進口稅則號數）包括棉花·棉紗及綫·羊毛及羊毛廢料·傳電及發電用電機·牛乳及乳酪·麵粉及穀類產物、淸單乙所包括得照法定滙率巾請外滙之物品、雖有數百種之多、但據大中社記者咋晤銀行界某員、據稱、該淸單所未列入者、尙有無數種物品、其不斷進口、實與滬市工商業之繁榮有關、又在九月內到期而尙未結滙之支票、得供給外滙、但銀行及進口商所執有之外幣特種保證金不在內、此項供給之外匯、應報吿平準會、</p>

<h3>工部局磋商補充　工廠應需煤斤　苟有頭緒一個半月可運竣　電力附加費屆時亦可取消</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、間諸負責人士、上海若能從華北獲得充量烟煤、以補充目前每年所短少之六七十萬噸、則影響本市高漲的生活費用之重大問題、可獲滿意解決、茲據披露、上海運入更多煤斤之問題、刻由工部局與日方進行磋商中、</p>
<p>電力公司　亦在商洽</p>
<p>而上海電力公司亦已商諸日方、以期獲取發電用之充量烟煤、尙未接覆、惟衆信日方陸海軍當局對於此事現擬採取若干步驟、日當局如果使上海能運到史多煤斤、當可促使電費大减、則各廠商受益匪淺、而高昂之物價、亦可望一致回跌、據負責方面聲稱、</p>
<p>所需用煤　缺少有限</p>
<p>上海每年所缺之煤、縱有半數、即三四十萬頓運來、亦可使情勢大爲好轉、而一般物價、殆必隨之跌落、目前上海運入之煤、年共二百萬噸左右、較所需之數、的少五十萬噸、上海電力公司產電所需之煤、前能自行供給、但在過去八閱月內、難獲止常數量之煤、故用煤不得不節减、苟該公司得獲更多之煤、則有减低或取消現行電力附加費之望、而各廠商旣獲較廉之電力、則所製貨物之成本、亦隨之减低、必於各方面俱有利益、即此間日商紗廠工廠、雖有設法向某方面獲得已廠所需之煤者、然對减低電費、亦必蒙其益也、</p>
<p>一個半月　媃中運竣</p>
<p>聞上海獲取更多煤斤之一項重大困難、爲目今船隻頗感缺乏、惟日當局若決計在上海現遇之困難中、予以台作、則仍有船可調供運煤來滬之用、果爾、祇須載重八千噸之輪船專運煤斤來埠、的一個月有半後、即能運到煤斤的四十萬噸、至於今冬家用煤、聞各方尙未採取加以補救之步驟、開　鑛務局與鴻基煤公司、現皆按期有煤運到上海、但能吾獲得充量煤斤以應全市家用所需、則未可知、</p>
<h3>俄輪蘇維脫　駛海參崴</h3>

<h3>電話公司　擴充電話　新用戶請裝電話　下月可按次接綫</h3>
<p>公共租界上海電話公司、自增加接綫費後、營業收人巳激增、惟前因原有綫路不敷分配、益之住戶呈現畸形繁榮後、工商各業對電話之需求隨之增加、但以原料因受戰事關係、不及補充、致一切計劃無法實現、茲該公司已有一部份材料裝運到滬、故該公司特分將「一號」「七號」「八號」「九號」以及「三號」「六號」等接綫臺從事加以擴充、同時對於架空電纜、亦積極敷設、一待竣工、即就用戶請求之先後、分別裝置、以利市民應用、各項工程、大致的於下月份內、即可全部竣事、</p>
<h3>克利扶輪　今午抵滬</h3>

<h3>核減熟水店水費　已在磋商</h3>
<p>熟水店業同業公會昨日午二時續向公共租界工部局請願、要求授命自來水公司、准予優待供給自來水、或變更計算辦法、當局代表允竭力設法、囑靜候命令、轉向自來水公司磋商、各代表始吿辭退、</p>
<p>水費比較</p>
<p>法商自來水公司之收費、素較英商自來水公司為廉、民國二十八年九月六日前、每度（即一立方公尺）僅收費八分七釐牛（銀子算）、至同年九月六日後、照上述價目加一成、又至同年十一月六日後、又加三成、至三十年一月二十六日後、照價加四成九、至三十年四月二十六日後、照價加七成半、現每立方公尺收費爲三角二分、校諸英商自來水公司收費相差懸殊、故望英國自來水公司之收取熟水店水費、亦按照該公司收費辦法收取、</p>
<p>平煤發售</p>
<p>熟水店所用平煤茲商得開　礦務局同意、決將尙餘三百噸三號煤屑平價發售、每戶限購半噸、每噸售國幣一百元、較前增售二十元、茲已定於（一）浴室十二日起開始發售、（二）熟水店十三日起開始至十五日止、</p>

<p>債臺高築被吿當初入按署供職、即債台高築、愈陷愈深、此即其盜賣槍械之動機、由是觀之、庭上須判被吿有罪云、被吿律師柯普士續起聲稱、　將於下次開庭時、爲被告辯護、檢察官乃請工部局警務處探長華爾出爲見證、華爾略稱、渠於滬西方面交來登記之九支手榆中、認明有一支係美按署者、</p>

<p>昨洋米初漲後跌、市價又見盤砌、早晨開市承前日漲風、買氣甚濃、蓋爲米商心理、無時不望上漲、政府已允供給上海洋米貨款以外滙、原爲民食着想、豈爲米商發財、有此接濟、本可安定民心、平準糧價、無如米商、反借此抬價、以爲即使照數核准、僅可獲得十五萬包乃至二十萬包之數、姑不論所推算者是吾準確、要知有此二十萬包一月新定貨、再加以二百萬包相近之存米、以及新米將陸續上市、足够有餘、論理在此半年內、尙用不着每月一二十萬包之定米、故米商如果言說多端、可將准供給之外滙、專供定購公賣米之用、惟米商昨以允供給之外滙不敷購米之造作、借題發揮、掀風作浪、米價乃又洶湧作勢、抬價居奇、皮球聲勢大振、市價立被踢起三四元、英華司小絞路貨一百三十七元五六角之價、現貨亦約一百三十二元至一百三十三元半、碎米大市貨九十五元七角至九十六元、高九十七元至九十七元半、允比現貨爲俏、現小絞前晚已漲、昨晨即自一百零八元開價大至一百十元零五角、其他各貨一致跟起、然市價高即有獲利者吐出、繼因美對遠東局勢有利、大不利於多方、午後市價又復喊低一二元、結果祇大一元至三元、成交數則加至近三萬包、又八九百噸云、</p>
<p>洋米不斷到滬、太古公司濟南輪前日（八日）傍晚到埠、由香港裝來洋米二千零七十包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、怡和洋行阜生輪昨午抵滬、亦由香港裝來洋米二千五百六十八包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司濟南輪除運來少數洋米外、叉有大批洋米、今日原輪運往靑島、本市又增裝一千五百包運靑、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米市本鄕店胃亦見轉濃、到貨仍屬有限、所以在貨主扳售之下、價並增高一二元、開南港早稻特自百五十三元半、决至百五十元、無錫白粳百五十元、浦東新粳百五十三元、</p>
<p>糯米邇來來源旣稀、是余洋米奔騰、賣買雙方均有向榮之心、其如零星胃口頗佳、日有大戶吸收、故懷貨者喊聲亦猛、結果市價並漲一三元、計開眞特團粒元達百二十九元、普通貨高自百二十六七元、决至百一十三元、中關百二十一元、糯茶百十三四元、</p>
<h3>麵粉乘高回出　坎麥一批接洽中</h3>
<p>洋粉早市即被謠言激刺、抬起三五角蓋謂洋粉定價雖通因不能結外滙而無法訂定、一般投機幫趁機活躍、金龍西棧自三十一元半開價大至三十一元七角、東棧三十一元九角半漲到三十二元二角、砲台高至三十三元二三角、乃在市氣蓬勃中即有獲，利浮多回出、故午刻已經平定、繼因不利多方之和平說又遍傳於市人心頓軟、賣氣又旺、市叉不支下墜、且洋粉雖無定貨、而洋麥劃價逐低、洋商又有包辦外滙之保證、並傳有坎麥一批、已在接洽中、因此砲台美粉即降至三十二元八角半收市、金龍東棧三十一元八角、西棧二十一元三角、均與前收相似、而本粉亦有二三百包、開價三十四元一二角、洋粉成交則有三萬多包云、</p>
<h3>油餅　青島生油　聞有直接成交</h3>
<p>昨日食油跌風頗熾、蓋以實銷去化猶滯、而來源續有少數扒埠、兼因謠傳利空、致拋賣者驟見衆多、價乃不支步趨挫落、結果菜油及棉子油比前又猛跌七八元、統市售開九月下交大有廠淸油六千多担、價爲一百七十八元至一百七十三元、又日華廠菜油四千餘桶、價一百七十九元至一百七十二元、聞靑島生油均有直接成交、價格不一、並傳某方有躉額菜油收進、價爲一百七十元、</p>
<p>十日豆子出口、有六百十五包運香港、三百包運新加坡、又運香港芝麻一百八十包、</p>
<h3>金融　客幫紛起活動　現金上落日大</h3>

<p>期貨變動愈小</p>
<p>自晨十月期每條（十兩）九點十五分開市、仍六千八百八十元、與上日收價回、天元多頭不斷加碼、升至六千八百八十五元、爲鑫源與德大新豐永售出、站在六千八百八十元關口、直至十一點牛、新豐永續售、賣小至六千八百七十二元、午收六千八百七十三元、下午德孚售予天元四十兩、爲六千八百七十五元、計開高二元、後無變動直至三點二十分恒記進三十兩、升至六千八百七十八元、天元復出、三點半收市六千八百七十五元、比上日收價軋小五元、當日十三元高低、現金號之本牌金、門市售價九千二百元、收進比售出低二百元、現標金仍無價無市、</p>

<h3>黑匯無可買賣　市態冷落</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央與匯豐兩掛牌及匯豐小櫃檯黑市央美滙價均已穩定、至英美滙之黑市仍少發展希望、據一未證實傳說、某外商銀行曾售出現美匯四元八七五、由非正式進口洋行購得、或謂代華商投機家、詢及匯豐花旗等行拒絕還價、掮客間漸見冷淸、英滙大的仍二辦士八五九三七五、美金四元八四三七五、照上日價無長縮可言、</p>
<p>香港匯市呆滯</p>

<h3>紗花　逢低收進逢高賣　紗市仍是隨流逐波　期貨尤為紊亂近漲遠跌</h3>
<p>紗市始昂繼平、但綫勢仍昂、此因原料問題、二則雜牌紗價頗固、所以人心良好、不過實際交易、未見巨量的發展、然　有一消息、南洋方面需要殷切、對於棉布交易愈旺、又有一說、廠方續有减工動議、因之一般財力充實之戶、依然逢低吸收也、但連朝上升程度已鉅、本日開高後引起盈利人出檔、檯面一鬆、市盤即速回落、不過就棉紗本身上着想、基礎尙固、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百七十二元、低價爲一千七百四十二元、午後初做一千七百四十六元、漸後升至一千七百五十八元、收盤又見回小爲一千七百五十一元、目前紗市或有一度盤旋、取引所行市、午後收盤已轉好面、布漲一四角紗遠漲九元、今日有棉紗八百七十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後　昂之氣續挺，買氣頗盛、首盤價爲一千七百六十五元、繼後得空頭之抵補，漲至一千七百六十九元、但有盈利人大都吐出、叉鬆至一千七百五十三四元、旋聞取引所開盤小、拍至棉布大跳、人心又見鬨起、買者紛紛而來、漲至千七日七十二元、嗣後取引所之盤回落、空頭又復活動、賣氣瀰漫、一疲跌至一千七百四十二元、然大戶某某等逢低落時、又來拖進、回好至一千七百五十二元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千〇十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>金變馬期貨市况、市氣紊亂、走勢已不若前日之挺秀、蓋美棉雖續進步、而以取引所兎起鶻落、謠諑頻繁、乃期紗此漲彼跌、遂變幻於瞬息之間、當晨初乃廠單首先憑藉洋花而再昂、是以期紗開出在買戶充塞下、亦見升騰、九月期爲一六五五元、猛漲達十五元之多、俱做至中途驟因謠傳利空、廠單突見下游、故期紗轉疲、十月期開出爲一六六五元、反降六元五角、旋以散戶逢低補進、忽又轉挺、十一月期做開爲一六九五元、微好二元、入後忽上忽落、走勢不一、午收近期見昂、遠期均疲、下午依然迂迴不前、各幫進出多出於廠單爲轉移故、仍參差、全日高低相差於十五元至二十五元之間、結果九月期爲一六五三元、尙漲十三元、而十月期爲一六二元、下跌九元、十一月期爲一六八一元、軋小上二元之多、茲將經過市價、列表於後、</p>
<h3>連朝風雨　新棉產將大減色</h3>
<p>現棉情况、突呈活躍、蓋邇來氣候時患風雨、並遭月前之暴飚、數度摧殘、致本埠四郊棉產大爲减色、故大衆覺未來之粗絨原料必有日趨稀貴之象、加以底貨亦薄弱、廠方雖無辦意、然執貨者意態頗强、且外棉新高峯層出不窮、故同業對於印棉交易昨日似頗繁榮也、茲將號家所做各花行情列左、</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方心思雖因海外棉市堅昂、及本市現紗步漲而依然熱烈、唯限於目下繼續不能結得美匯、交易無異形同停頓、連日除現棉聊資點綴外、定貨交易、實爲大衆期望、迫切解決外滙、以利各方訂購美棉之大問題、蓋若延不解決、或無具體保全之策、其影響整個棉市前途利害匪淺也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因政府報告利於空頭而跌、續後又因內地來源仍稀、同業及投機者不斷買進而反漲、結果昨日收盤價格較之上日的漲二十五六磅因不等、</p>

<h3>停供黑滙交易</h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>黑滙交易，在這四五年來，爲了十分之二三市塲上有這個需耍，把國家的經濟，也就是人民的生計，付出了過當的代價，來苦心維持着。可是維持的回聲，就造成了十分之六·七的大多數人的投機心理，投機的結果，物價騰貴，民生益艱。昨日平準會的限令各外商銀行，不得經營黑市外滙之買賣，也可以說是投機者所促請。</p>
<p>正當的外滙需要，嚴格審核，繼續供給，這是必然的，也是必要的。在這裏我們期望的，是必須鄭重手續，將罅漏之處，縝密堵塞。</p>
<p>國際間有了正當貿易，自不能沒有外滙的付與，可是在這個時候，洋貨的消耗品，人們早就不該再有豐裕的享受，現在停供黑市外滙，這個停供的促請者，實在還是洋貨消耗者揮霍的結果。</p>
<p>上海的工商界，在今日應有一個認識，即這個停供黑滙的命令，一面是國產品推銷的機會，不是國產品漲價的機會，一面是洋貨消耗品不該再在市塲猖獗。有這兩個必然的結果，我們工商界應該知道今後努力的方針。</p>
<h3>紀念汪孚禮先生　已於七日領帖追悼</h3>
<p>— 陳禾章</p>
<p>訊得二十六年秋間，在我服務的一家公司的董事會議席上，久耳大名的在孚禮先生，因此相識了。</p>
<p>去年春，我爲了撰寫一篇上海紡織業的情形，又與友人合編「中時戰時經濟志」，要請敎一些經濟資料，便在某天早晨至中行拜訪先生，承很和氣地接待。</p>
<p>後來叉擬造訪，先生因病未果，旋知先生以積勞成疾，方養病於格羅醫院，以常時俗覊，遲遲未往探視。隔幾天，忽見報端報喪，先生已於十十二月二日千古，傷哉！</p>
<p>先生一生盡瘁紡織事業，功績卓著。其生平事蹟，雖罄萬言，尙不能詳盡。現姑作一簡略的叙述，以興世人崇景之意。</p>
<p>先生早年官費留學於日本東京高工紡織科，學成歸國，就聘於上海恒豐紡織廠。其後歷任大中華紗廠，無錫申新三廠，滬申新二廠等總工程師及廠長職。後又全權整理中行管理的鼎鑫紗廠。經其擘劃，卓著成效，由是聲望日隆，自國家機關以及官商銀行多相委託。民二十四年轉任中國銀行總管理處業務稽核，主持棉業投資，　進該行有關各廠廠務。翌年兼任中國棉業公司副總經理。至此先生地位更高，凡新廠舉辦或舊廠改革，多以先生一言爲決。先生誠紡織界先進，而執斯界的牛耳。</p>
<p>尙有　　的，先生鬥弟子數千，今日全國紡織廠的中堅，多出訓導。先生公除之暇，輒撰文發表於報章　誌，讜論名言，爲世所　，　國家失此賢良，正是莫大的損失；可是先生的精神，常留人間，永垂不朽。</p>

<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>「消息，眞不知幾時有消息咧」。他關上了門，退回裹面去，沒精打采的坐着。</p>
<p>然而消息倒並不像他理想那樣的來得慢，只不是好消息罷了。</p>
<p>小狗子和陳大走後，第二天郵差便寄來了一封快信，是縣立初中的那位方校長寫的，吿訴他梅寳並無下落，最末的一段是說。</p>
<p>「……因尙某之友劉某，嫌疑重大，公安局曾將其傳訊三次，嚴加究詰，但亦無結果。現尊紀張某們暫寓敝校門房內，每日出外追尋，手持令嬡像片，四處訪問，雖猶未獲眉目，其惠我之忱，殊屬難得。或能因此而得令媛下落，亦未可知也。……」</p>
<p>秋海棠是從來不信神佛，或何種宗敎的，但看完這封信，也禁不住對天跪了下去。</p>
<p>「天啊！可憐可憐咱們吧！」他就在磚地上跪着，輕悄悄的禱告起來。　—當然他並不會像在舞臺上演戲那樣的先起什麽「叫頭。—「小狗子的腿，一定要跑斷了；我的心也快要碎了。可憐我實在並沒有造過什麽大孼，快讓我的女兒平平安安的回來吧……」</p>
<p>從這天起，他幾乎每天這樣不停的禱吿着。然而越禱吿，消息却越來得沉悶了。足足有一個禮拜，他不曾再從方校長那接到什麽信。（二〇七）</p>
<h3>一個獲得助學金者的真摯</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>不幸的我，爲了家庭貧寒，自小學畢業後，就到上海來，在書局內謀了一個練習生的位置。</p>
<p>我在書局內已六個年頭了。可是，我却依然是一個送貨打包的雜差。無疑地，這是受戰事影響的緣故；但是大部原因，却還是我自己沒有豐富的學識，不能管理複雜而較難的事務。</p>
<p>「書到用時方恨少」眞是一句至理名言：我爲了缺乏敎育，處處受虧，於是感到增進知識的重耍。去秋，我入滬江英專補習，蒙朱老師循循善誘，使我情緒興奮，對英文課發生了興趣，雖然讀的是初級英文，却好像是快要達到成功的月的似的，今春爲了環境逼迫，急欲達到目的，就不加老慮，盲目地跳了一級，自此，欲速不達，反無進步，我自己也不知在半年來得了些什麽！暑期間，因經濟而致輟學，雖仍在自修，但眼簾前好似被黑暗遮住了。</p>
<p>前月看到貴報助學金委員會工商組的創立，激起了我繼續進取的意志和求助的行動，使我了解人類互助精神的偉大，眼前漸漸地光明起來。</p>
<p>八月二十九日的下午，我帶着慚愧和感激的心緒，在濛濛細雨中向貴報館討了一份申請書，拖着疲倦的腿兒回來，翌日，備着小心請經理先生簽名蓋章，又在細雨傍晚中抱着希望的心將申請書送上，又决日接到的談的信，感到十分欣慰與暢爽。好容易，才給我等到了談話的時候。</p>
<p>問話的編輯先生，雖是那樣地和氣，大方，但是我却感到非凡嚴肅，當時，我經過簡單的被問後，他就關照我回去，核准或吾，注意每天的報紙。我充滿着感激，諾諾速聲地退了出來。在路上，好像是已核准了似的，覺得遍體輕鬆和愉快。</p>
<p>前（五日）申報的名單中，我的姓名果然也在其中了，我是多麼快慰和感謝此項助學金的義舉。午後，領到了保送免費信，申請的手續是完備了，我可安心即繼續求學了。現在我是一個得助於工商組助學金的人，我蒙受着社會上熱烈的幫助，心中是多麽地感激？我必將努力振作着，堅持意志，踏上光明的大道。</p>

<p>眞宗雖非本案之主角，而度爲本案之導綫，蓋劉后爲其配，仁宗爲其子。案眞宗爲太宗子，太宗違母兄之命，陷弟廷美於罪死，威姪德昭至自殺，趙普又出賣太視以希寵，揆之人倫道德，太宗與普，皆棄信蔑義不友不忠之入也。茲不必多言題外事，以言劉后，原非正配，出身亦微。眞宗之正妃潘氏，（潘美之第八女·未立爲后已死。决爲郭皇后，（郭守文第二女）生一子，即悼獻太子，九歲（咸平穴年）而殤。</p>
<p>后亦於景德四年薨。眞宗生五子，皆早殤，以仁宗爲最幼而獨存。眞宗最寵愛劉氏，亦最畏劉氏，後宮生子多不鞠育，甚至寄養於人（如張茂實，後避英宗諱，宋史作張孜）。故仁宗若非劉后子，亦不得立，即使得立，亦不得信任。何况仁宗誕世，已在悼獻太子死後第七年，眞宗已爲四十三歲，亦爲郭后死後之第三年。李宸妃爲劉后侍婢，職司寢，劉后若有子，恐不讓宸妃得幸於眞宗，則亦何有乎仁宗。仁宗後二年，（大中祥符五年十二月）劉氏始立爲后，故仁宗不能無劉氏，劉氏亦藉仁宗而益重。</p>

<h3>U.S. and Britain Determine Foreign Policy: Major Developments Brewing in the Far East, Grew and Toyoda Met Twelve Times Last Week, Newly Appointed Japanese Ambassador to Britain to Depart for London</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th (International News Agency) – It is widely expected that Washington will make a major decision this week regarding its foreign policy and relations between the U.S. and Britain with Japan. It is believed that Washington's decision is due to the stalemate in U.S.-Japan talks and Japan's reliance on the Axis powers. Officials and diplomatic circles believe that although the military faction and some newspapers in Tokyo have adopted a belligerent attitude, Japan has a significant chance of breaking away from the Axis and favoring closer ties with the U.S. and Britain. It is reported that Prime Minister Konoe is scheduled to make a public announcement on Wednesday after an audience with the Emperor, supporting amity with the United States. The State Department has been striving to reach a "standstill agreement" with Japan to prevent the United States from being drawn into the situation in the Pacific. According to the above information, there seems to be a greater possibility of progress in U.S.-Japan talks. However, as officials have not yet released any public announcements regarding the progress, the speculation that major developments are brewing is increasingly credible.</p>
<p>New York, 9th (United Press) – Columbia Broadcasting System has received a radio broadcast from Tokyo stating that qualified Japanese sources anticipate President Roosevelt will announce something regarding U.S.-Japan relations in his speech on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Foreign Minister Toyoda reported to the Cabinet today on recent diplomatic developments.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Information Bureau stated today that, from Japan's point of view, the most important issue at present is important, and that although some matters are important, "I regret that I cannot comment on this matter at this time."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew has met with Foreign Minister Toyoda twelve times in the past week, making it the busiest period of U.S.-Japan diplomatic activity in Tokyo during Grew's nine-year tenure. It was also announced that Nomura's special advisor, Wakasugi, will return to Washington by ship within a few days.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Declares in the House of Commons: Prevent a Pacific War</h3>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters) – When the House of Commons reconvened today after the summer recess, Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak amidst cheers. He first stated that the important conclusions reached during his meeting with President Roosevelt included the following four items: (1) the issuance of the Eight-Point Declaration; (2) methods of assisting the Soviet Union; (3) a policy towards Japan aimed at preventing further aggression in the Far East that would endanger the security or interests of the U.S. and Britain, and preventing the spread of war to the Pacific through timely action; and (4) discussions on a large number of purely technical matters and the establishment of close personal relationships between the senior command of the British and U.S. naval, land, and air forces.</p>
<p>London, 9th (United Press) – Officials announced today that the British government has reached decisions on the four main items of the recent Roosevelt-Churchill talks. The announcement stated that decisions have been made regarding the two leaders' Eight-Point Declaration, assistance to the Soviet Union, a policy towards Japan aimed at preventing the spread of war to the Pacific, and technical matters.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Haito News Agency) – Spokesman Ishii of the Japanese Information Bureau stated today that Britain is not participating in the ongoing talks between Japan and the U.S. in Washington, and that Japan and Britain are not conducting such talks in London. He continued by saying that the new Japanese Ambassador to Britain will soon be departing for London, but refused to announce his name.</p>
<p>Honolulu, 9th (United Press) – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, after completing his trip to Britain in April and meeting with President Roosevelt, left here yesterday aboard a Clipper en route to Antipodes. It is reported that "if the situation worsens and the small democracies of the Pacific face aggression, the United States will not stand idly by." He predicted that U.S.-Japan negotiations would be "completely successful," meaning that further wartime actions by Japan in the Far East would be prevented.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Governor-General of Taiwan, General Shao Lin, wrote in the "Kokumin Shimbun" yesterday that although the South Seas are Japan's economic lifeline, "if you mistakenly believe that the 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' is solely for the benefit of the Japanese, then you will never achieve the purpose of the 'Co-Prosperity Sphere.'" He also said that if Japan appears only as "another aggressor," then the natives of the South Seas will unite with the current rulers to resist Japan.</p>
<h3>Japan Sends Ships to British Territories to Evacuate Nationals</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that, in return for Japan's allowing Britain to send a ship to Japan to pick up British nationals, Britain has also agreed to allow Japan to send ships to British territories to evacuate Japanese nationals. The British ship sent to Japan will arrive on September 24 to evacuate 1,000 British nationals who are not of British descent. Three Japanese ships will be sent to the Straits Settlements, India, the Near East, and Africa, respectively. A fourth Japanese ship will transport diplomats and military attachés to Europe to replace those currently in Europe. When the ships return to Japan, they will carry Japanese nationals from Europe and other regions back home. It is reported that there are currently 600 Japanese nationals in Britain, 700 in Malaya, 60 in India, and 40 in East Africa.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (International News Agency) – State Department officials revealed that negotiations between the U.S. and Japan on the evacuation of nationals have made some progress. Japan has proposed that one Japanese ship carry 1,000 U.S. nationals back to the United States, and that the ship carry 300 Japanese nationals back to Japan on its return trip. Japan has also proposed that the U.S. and Japan operate a weekly service for mail and passengers. Although these evacuation negotiations are underway, they are completely separate from the exploratory talks on the fundamental relationship between the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<h3>Ishii Talks to Reporters About Japan-Soviet Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Information Bureau told reporters that the Japan-Soviet commercial treaty will soon be submitted to the Privy Council for approval, but the date has not yet been set. He also said that in previous years, when Japan-Soviet relations were tense, Japan did not object to the U.S. transporting oil to Vladivostok because the U.S. was also transporting oil to Japan. Reliable observers here speculate that Ishii's statement is roughly to the effect that if the U.S. resumes transporting oil to Japan, then the issue of transporting oil to Vladivostok will no longer exist.</p>
<h3>Indian Troops Defend Malayan Airfields</h3>
<p>Simla, 9th (Reuters) – Almost all of the British airfields in the Malay Peninsula are now being defended by Indian troops. These troops include those belonging to the Indian Army Headquarters, as well as infantry recruited from various princely states of India and dispatched by the British government. They have been trained to recognize the markings on British, U.S., German, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and Dutch aircraft, and are well-versed in the lessons learned from the air battles in Norway, Greece, and Crete, and methods of dealing with dive bombers and paratroopers. Recent demonstrations have shown that the defense arrangements are quite comprehensive. The important role played by Indian troops in the defense of Malaya is evident here.</p>
<h3>Japan's Obligations to the Axis to Be Carefully Studied, Believes U.S.-Germany Dispute Is Unrelated to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Information Bureau stated that there are many different opinions regarding the Greer incident, and that "we cannot determine who is telling the truth and who is not. Therefore, we must wait and see before we can criticize."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Reuters) – The "Japan Times," mouthpiece of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated yesterday that the Greer incident has placed U.S.-Germany relations in a new environment. From now on, if U.S. and German warships encounter each other in the German-designated blockade zone, war will inevitably break out. The "Asahi Shimbun" also predicts that similar conflicts will occur in the future, leading to war between the U.S. and Germany. If the U.S. continues to disregard the blockade zones established by Germany and Italy, war between the U.S., Germany, and Italy will be unavoidable. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that regardless of the new developments caused by this incident, Japan will continue its policy of working towards world peace, and that whether the obligations of the Tripartite Pact are affected by this incident will depend on a careful study of future developments.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Japanese newspapers in Tokyo unanimously predicted today that the Greer incident may become the path for the United States to enter the war. The newspapers also stated that the United States must be responsible for this incident, as the United States has repeatedly violated international law in the past. However, as of today, all Japanese reactions to the Greer incident consider it to be unrelated to Japan and not bound by the Tripartite Alliance. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that Japan will continue to maintain its independence and autonomy and work for world "peace," and that Japan will do its best to prevent the war from spreading to the Far East.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Fascist leader Nakano, leader of the Tohwa Society, announced that he would deliver a lion-like speech in the hall of Hibiya Park today. Nakano is a key proponent of the Tripartite Pact in Japan and opposes the current policy direction of the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Adjourns for Three Days to Mourn the President's Mother, Pétain Sends Condolences to Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th (United Press) – The Senate adjourned yesterday to mourn Mrs. Roosevelt and will reconvene on Thursday. The Senate also passed a resolution expressing its grief.</p>
<p>Vichy, 8th (Havas) – After receiving the news of the death of President Roosevelt's mother, Marshal Pétain sent a telegram of condolence to President Roosevelt. He had met her several times in Paris and always admired her demeanor. He was deeply saddened by her passing and sent his condolences.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Appoints Yosizawa as Ambassador to Vietnam</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – The government today appointed Yosizawa as Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Vietnam, and announced that the appointment was made because relations between Japan and Vietnam have become even friendlier after the conclusion of the mutual defense pact. Yosizawa will handle diplomatic negotiations with the Governor of Vietnam and lead all Japanese institutions in the area. Former Japanese Minister to Argentina, Uchiyama, will be sent as Yosizawa's assistant. Yosizawa said that Foreign Minister Toyoda asked him to take on this position, and that "the world knows that the Dutch East Indies are rich in natural resources, but Vietnam is also very rich in rice, coal, and rubber, all of which are very important to Japan. Therefore, Japan and Vietnam have very deep political and economic ties that should be promoted, and this is my mission." The government also appointed former Consul-General in Manila, Yoshida, as Consul-General in Hanoi to assist Yosizawa.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Battle for Leningrad</h3>
<p>According to the majority of opinions from international observers these past two days, the situation in Soviet Leningrad is, generally speaking, already in a state of emergency and danger. Of course, this only refers to the perilous state of its external lines of communication, or at most, only indicates that it is facing the danger of being besieged; it certainly does not mean that the Soviet Union may soon have to consider a voluntary retreat from the area due to the heavy sacrifices and the urgent pressure it is under, and it certainly does not mean that the German forces will be able to defeat the defending forces in one fell swoop and occupy the area in the near future.</p>
<p>Currently, Leningrad is under the most pressure from the northwest and southwest corners. As for its northeastern fronts, the German forces are unable to reach them for the time being. Even the line of communication between its southeastern corner and Moscow, although the German forces have been attacking for many days, there is still no possibility of cutting it off in the short term. Assuming that the German forces can continue their recent fierce offensive without being pushed back by the Soviet counterattacks, then they may eventually be able to cut off the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, then send a large army to the northwest corner to launch a pincer movement, and then cut off the railway communication between Leningrad and Vologda. At that time, Leningrad's external transport routes would be declared completely cut off, and it would be under attack from all sides by the German forces. However, it is worth pointing out that even if the German forces occupy all of its vital external transport routes, it is still far from being besieged. With such a vast area as the Leningrad Military District, plus the defense of a million-strong army inside, and the support of the entire Red Army outside, it is truly difficult to think that the German forces could trap it in a heavy siege, with no internal or external communication, and then slowly encircle and eliminate it! As far as the German forces currently deployed on the northern front are concerned, this move is absolutely impossible without a large increase in manpower and weaponry; and conversely, for the attacker who is at a disadvantage in terms of quantity, the conduct of this encirclement attempt is a very dangerous thing.</p>
<p>The German forces are now desperately attacking in an attempt to occupy Leningrad before winter arrives, in order to temporarily achieve a more decisive victory on the northern front. However, the Soviet Union must also do its utmost to defend it, or even prepare for a lonely defense, which has many very important implications. First of all, if Leningrad falls, the situation of the entire Soviet line will be greatly shaken. The threat to Moscow may be a relatively secondary matter, but most importantly, at that time, in order to stabilize its own situation, the Soviet Union, even on the central and southern fronts, would have to consider adjusting its positions and shifting the entire line backwards. Many important industrial areas and military strongholds would also be lost as a result. Secondly, at this time when the Moscow Tripartite Conference is about to be held, the Soviet Union seems to have to maintain its military prestige at any cost. Recently, large-scale air battles between Germany and the Soviet Union have been taking place in the skies over this area. The Soviet Union is already using all its strength to fight for control of the air, so how much more the struggle for the Leningrad Military District, which is related to the prestige of the entire Soviet army! The success or failure of this battle has a very significant impact on the outcome of the Tripartite Conference. Again, the Soviet army's defense of Leningrad is indeed playing an important shielding role for its entire rear. As long as Leningrad does not fall, the German forces will not be able to advance towards Moscow; otherwise, after the German forces occupy Leningrad, they can launch a pincer movement towards Moscow, and that will be the true situation of encirclement and annihilation. Therefore, no matter what, the Soviet Union must hold the northern front in Leningrad, and even if it immediately engages in a large-scale decisive battle with the German forces, it probably cannot be spared.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems that the only way for the German forces to take Leningrad is to completely defeat the Soviet forces with military power; it is absolutely impossible to force it to retreat automatically by outflanking and pressuring the Soviet forces. Since the beginning of the war, the Soviet forces on the southern and central fronts have retreated slightly, while the northern front, due to geographical reasons, has almost appeared in the form of a battle for Leningrad from the very beginning, making it impossible for the Soviet forces to retreat. Therefore, statistically, the German forces have made the least progress on this route. Leningrad is not only an important port and industrial and transportation center, but also one of the most important fortresses of the Soviet Union. Its importance to the entire Soviet Union far exceeds that of Kiev, Odessa, Minsk, and other places, and is second only to Moscow.</p>
<p>Then, is it possible for the German forces to capture Leningrad by force? This, on the one hand, depends on the strategy and strength of the German offensive, and on the other hand, it especially depends on the determination and strategy of the Soviet defense. Within the Leningrad Military District, the strength that the Soviet Union has now concentrated probably exceeds one million, and even if all the equipment and supplies are temporarily cut off from the outside world, they can probably be self-sufficient in the short term, which is not a problem. The lonely defense of Odessa on the southern front to this day has fully demonstrated the Red Army's ability and determination to engage in a larger-scale lonely defense. What's more, this time, the Soviet army's supreme strategy seems to be to defend by attacking. Then, assuming that the possibility of the German forces besieging Leningrad intensifies, at that time, not only in the outer ring of this area will the Soviet Union reinforce and counterattack, forming a larger encirclement of the German forces; even the Soviet forces on the southern and central fronts will simultaneously launch a larger-scale offensive, making it impossible for the German forces to concentrate their strength to attack Leningrad exclusively.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to point out that the momentum of the German forces' third offensive on the entire front is clearly weakening every day, and the northern front is of course no exception. Unless the German forces increase a large number of fresh troops and a large number of weapons, probably before winter, the battle for Leningrad will never escape the stalemate of a tug-of-war.</p>

<h3>Australian Minister to China Discusses Mission to China</h3>
<p>Singapore – Australia's first Minister to China, Eggleston, is en route from Australia to the wartime capital of China to take up his new post. Speaking here, he stated that Australia is extremely interested in China's restoration of its position as a strong country in the Pacific. His mission is of great significance because it represents the Australian government's and people's sympathy for the leaders and people of China. He only hopes that his first task after arriving will be to contact Chinese government officials to expand the existing good relations between the people of both sides. He hopes that his work in Chongqing can result in a large increase in trade between China and Australia. When China is revived, Australia will definitely be eager to assist it. Australia, along with other Pacific countries, will benefit from China's economic revival. Australia's policy is to closely follow Britain in everything. Before his first visit to , the Australian Minister will with local Chinese business leaders and national defense officials. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Discusses Recent Diplomatic and Financial Situation, Relations Between China and Canada and China and Czechoslovakia Become Closer, Reform Administrative System and Unify Finances</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Administrative Yuan Secretary-General Jiang Tingfu received Chinese and foreign reporters on the 8th and discussed the diplomatic relations between China and Canada and China and Czechoslovakia, as well as the situation of China's financial reform. Jiang first stated that the issue of China and Canada exchanging envoys has been announced, and the candidates for the first ministers of the two countries can be decided within days. What we are most satisfied with is the speech by Canadian Defense Minister Ralston, who stated that Canada will supply military materials to China and the Soviet Union, which not only indicates that the relations between China and Britain are increasingly promoted. He then stated that China recently recognized Czechoslovakia. President Beneš sent a reply to Chongqing, stating that China's kindness is extremely appreciable. Our people have always had a good impression of the Czech Republic, and President Beneš upheld justice on the Nine-One-Eight Incident in the League of Nations. The spirit of Czech democracy is also very admirable. The economic relations between the two countries in the past have also been very close. Jiang finally talked about the new initiatives in China's internal affairs, the main idea being that there will be a major reform in China's administrative system this year, namely the unification of finances. China has made very significant progress in political unification in recent years, but this is not yet apparent in the financial system. Starting from next fiscal year, the provincial budgets will be part of the central budget. The central government will instruct the main points of budget preparation and approve the estimated amount. The provincial governments will prepare the budget based on the situation within this estimated amount. At the same time, all provincial tax revenues will be directly collected by the central government. This is a major reform in Chinese politics. Afterwards, the central government can take into account the local conditions and coordinate the national financial affairs. The budgets of each province in the previous year increased by about 20 to 30 percent compared to this year. The provincial governments will certainly not feel any difficulties. This reform will inevitably involve the finances of the county governments. In the past, the finances of the provinces and counties were not clearly demarcated. In the future, the central government will decide on the revenues of the county governments, and those that are decided to belong to the county government will still be collected by the county. Those that are approved by the county council can increase taxes. Therefore, the county finances can truly become an autonomous unit in the future.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Since late last night, there has been heavy rain here. About two-thirds of the Western Suburbs Avenue has experienced soil erosion, destroying one house and damaging telegraph and electric light lines. At the same time, some houses in Chongqing were also washed away by the heavy rain. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chongqing experienced a very severe storm yesterday, followed by torrential rain, causing disasters that were even worse than those caused by any day of Japanese bombing this year. The roofs of the city's houses, already damaged by bombs, meant that almost every bed in the city was wet last night. The underground printing rooms of the famous newspapers here were also flooded, causing the publication of the newspapers to be delayed by several hours, but the newspapers were all published as usual. The newspapers also said that rainwater flowed in from the entrances and air vents, and the printing workers were working in knee-deep water. In the western suburbs, at least three cement surfaces collapsed, and many houses collapsed, injuring several people. In the only Western-style hotel, the Jialing Hotel, some ministers and foreign guests used umbrellas and raincoats to cover their beds, allowing them to sleep for a few hours. But when they woke up in the morning, the floor of the room was already half an hour submerged in water. (United Press, 9th)</p>

<h3>Air Raid on the Red Sea: American Cargo Ship Sunk, A Serious Incident Following the Greer Incident, US-German War Seems Unavoidable</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 9th: The State Department announced yesterday that the American cargo ship "Steel Seafarer" was sunk by bombs dropped by an aircraft in the Red Sea on September 7th. About twenty crew members were rescued. The identity of the aircraft that dropped the bombs is still unknown. According to Lloyd's Insurance Company, the "Steel Seafarer" belonged to the Isbrandtsen Company and had a displacement of 5,719 tons. This sinking is the first attack on an American ship in the Near East since the start of the war. Since President Roosevelt designated the Red Sea route outside the war zone on April 7th, American ships have resumed using it. The "Steel Seafarer" is the second American ship sunk in this conflict, the first being the "Robin Moor." The announcement of this American ship's sinking coincides almost exactly with the time of President Roosevelt's scheduled speech, but the speech has been postponed due to his mother's death. This incident may influence the tone of the President's speech on Thursday, as it is already speculated that the President will reiterate his policy of freedom of the seas in light of the Greer incident. Reliable sources in London say that an American supply ship, believed to be an oil tanker, has been sunk in the Near East.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 9th: The American ship "Steel Seafarer" sank 200 miles south of Suez on a moonlit night. Several survivors have been rescued by British ships. The ship was built in 1921 and belonged to the Isbrandtsen Steamship Company. It was carrying American military supplies for the US military in the Middle East. It is reported that German long-range bombers have recently been active at night in the area south of Suez, mostly departing from bases in the Dodecanese Islands.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 9th: The news of the American ship's sinking in the Red Sea has caused surprise here. Now, in addition to military supplies, Egypt's ordinary trade has also largely shifted to the United States to avoid going around the Cape of Good Hope. Therefore, in addition to a large number of military supplies, the United States is also shipping large quantities of goods and food. Any interference with this communication line will have far-reaching consequences. Most people are speculating about the impact of the American ship's sinking on the international situation.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: Regarding the sinking of the American ship in the Red Sea, people here commented today that the Red Sea has long been clearly declared a war zone by Italy. If President Roosevelt does not consider the Red Sea as a war zone according to the American Neutrality Act, it is obviously inappropriate. As for the nationality of the aircraft that bombed the ship, it is still unknown.</p>
<h3>US Future Maritime Policy: Meeting Force with Force</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th: President Roosevelt's upcoming broadcast speech has become a topic of discussion and speculation. Some people in Washington expect that the speech will announce that the future policy of the United States will be to meet force with force at sea. According to well-informed sources, the President will certainly propose the following points: (1) Germany and the world must know that the United States wants to maintain the smooth flow of its communication line with Iceland; (2) The discovery of any hostile warships or aircraft in the area between the United States and Iceland will be regarded as an effort to interfere with this communication; (3) American warships will be ordered to fire on any hostile warships or aircraft encountered in these territorial waters in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th: It is expected that President Roosevelt's remarks on Thursday will discuss the incident of the US destroyer Greer being attacked by a German submarine, and the work that the US Navy should be doing in the Atlantic now and in the future. This is clearly indicated by the observers' perception of the German reaction and comments on the Greer case, which indicate that the Atlantic war is unfavorable to the German side.</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 9th: According to the British Broadcasting Corporation's broadcast yesterday of a German radio station, if the United States continues to ignore the blockaded coasts, war will be inevitable. It also stated that the depth charges dropped by the American destroyer Greer may be the first shot in an open conflict between the United States and Germany.</p>
<h3>Berlin Full of Anti-American Rhetoric</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th: Yesterday's comments in Berlin newspapers regarding the battle between the American warship Greer and a German submarine were filled with abusive language towards President Roosevelt, with phrases such as "Roosevelt Creates Incidents," "Deceptive Depth Charges," "Lies Incite Anger," and "Roosevelt's Deceptive Actions." The Börsen Zeitung stated that Washington is currently trying to make Roosevelt's deliberately issued lies appear as facts. Its motive is just like the words of those close to Roosevelt, that is, to drive the American people into the war vortex by means of successive incidents.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: Dr. Helfferich, a foreign affairs reporter for the Hamburger Fremdenblatt, commented that "The Greer incident is only enough to prove that President Roosevelt has secretly ordered his fleet to fire on German boats. Because American domestic opinion has not reached a sufficiently mature level, he is unwilling to publicly issue a firing order. If Roosevelt does not allow the American fleet to operate in the European war zone, and does not want to involve an America that has not been threatened in the war vortex, then there is absolutely no possibility of an incident occurring between the United States and Germany." His argument is enough to represent the attitude of the German newspapers towards this Greer incident. They all stated that the American warships continuously dropped depth charges on the German submarine until midnight, even though there was no result. This is indeed an act of aggression by the American military. President Roosevelt deliberately wanted to cause an incident in order to use it as an excuse to participate in the war. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated, "This attack on the German submarine is a fraudulent means for Roosevelt to deceive the American people. Germany has always ignored the insults he has orchestrated. Unexpectedly, he became angry and ordered American warships to fire. This public enemy has long been thinking of creating incidents to put the people in danger, and now he has achieved his goal." The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated, "At a time when Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister King are eagerly awaiting American participation in the war, this incident suddenly occurred, which shows Washington's intentions. Roosevelt could not explain the incident in detail at the intelligence meeting. He only said that, in view of the current situation, this must be an act of aggression, so he has decided to eliminate these bandits. "The statement issued by Germany on Saturday tore off the American mask and completely exposed the background of this incident." The Berliner Abendpost stated, "Since last month, Roosevelt has exposed his true face. He and his party members pray to God every day to grant some kind of incident so that American aid to Britain can become more active. Roosevelt's policy of alliance with the Soviet Union has made his people very dissatisfied, so he had to find a way to shift his people's attention to the Atlantic Ocean, and thus this incident occurred."</p>
<h3>Allied Forces Occupy Spitsbergen Without Shedding a Drop of Blood, Aim to Prevent Germany from Utilizing the Island's Coal Mines, A Strategically Important Arctic Outpost</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Allied forces have landed on the Spitsbergen archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, with the main purpose of preventing the German side from using the island's rich coal mines. The landing forces are Canadian, British, and Norwegian troops, led by a Canadian commander. They encountered no enemy resistance. The British War Office announced this matter, saying that for various purposes, it was decided to send a combined Canadian-British-Norwegian force to the Arctic Ocean. Under the command of a Canadian general, they have landed on the Spitsbergen archipelago without encountering enemy resistance. The main purpose of the landing is to prevent the enemy from using the island's rich coal mines for their own war purposes. Previously, part of Spitsbergen's coal was used by the people of northern Norway, but now we know the enemy's plan to seize all the coal, including that produced in Spitsbergen, exclusively for military transport to the far north. Now the German side cannot obtain this fuel source. One direct result of the Allied landing on Spitsbergen is that a large number of Norwegian miners and their families have now come to Britain to participate in the Allied war effort here. Most of them will join the Norwegian army or serve in the Norwegian merchant fleet. Spitsbergen is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, located between the Franz Josef Land archipelago and Greenland, belonging to Norway. Its main islands are West Spitsbergen, Edge Island, Northeast Land, Barents Island, and Prince Charles Foreland. They are all mountainous, with the highest peak near Trollheimen Bay.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 9th: Allied forces landed yesterday on the Spitsbergen archipelago in northern Norway. Observers here all say that the island is not only of great military strategic value, but in the future, airplanes flying from North America to Murmansk, USSR, via Iceland, can also land there mid-way. In addition, it is generally believed that regarding Britain's occupation of the archipelago, and the British Air Force's continuous bombing of the Norwegian coast, it is expected that the British army will sooner or later attempt to land on the Norwegian mainland in order to echo the Red Army and achieve a restraining effect.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: British, Canadian and Norwegian troops landed on the archipelago of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean without shedding a drop of blood, then occupied the archipelago's valuable coal mines. Germany intended to use the coal mines after the German-Soviet war began to supplement its gradually decreasing coal reserves. The British War Office issued a public statement on Monday night, revealing the news of the Allied forces landing on the archipelago of Spitsbergen. The island is 1,500 miles from the northern tip of Britain and is located in the far north. Therefore, in the first year after Norway was occupied, the various belligerent nations seemed not to pay attention to it. Although the entire territory of Norway was full of German troops, there was no action taken on the island. When the Norwegian government was still in northern Norway, it used the warmer weather to transport ample supplies to the island, because for most of the year, the island's external communication was blocked by ice. Shortly after the German side occupied Norway, it sent three military officers or mining experts to the island, who merely inspected the coal mines hastily and left. The people were able to live peacefully and undisturbed as usual during the long Arctic winter, and the Norwegian civil administrator remained on the island and administered it independently. The Soviet Union enjoys mining concessions in the Barents Island of the Spitsbergen archipelago, employing about 2,300 workers to mine coal. Perhaps the German side delayed taking action because the Soviet Union had this concession on the island, but since the German attack on the Soviet Union, Spitsbergen has entered the military operation zone. According to German reports, when preparing for war against the Soviet Union, the German side tried its best to collect the fuel supplies it could obtain in Norway, and urgently needed the coal of the Spitsbergen archipelago to supply naval tools along the Norwegian coast. However, this year's export season for Spitsbergen was one month later than usual, and navigation was still not possible in May. The amount of coal exported in June and July was very small. The large amount of coal accumulated on the archipelago in winter was simply not exported. Germany planned to have two ships travel between Norway and Spitsbergen, but the German side was obviously worried about Allied actions and could not allocate warships to protect this transportation. Those living on the Spitsbergen archipelago are all Norwegians, and there are not a few who have avoided German forced military service from northern Norway and come to these archipelagoes. According to the miners, one part of their daily life is listening to Norwegian broadcast messages from London day and night. All the islands celebrate Norwegian Independence Day.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 9th: The British Navy has occupied the strategically important archipelago of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean. The British side here believes that this move is a valuable way to enable all sea routes to reach the important Soviet port of Murmansk, just as the British and Soviet forces attacked Iran, intending to keep the land entrance to the Soviet Union intact. The total population of the archipelago is between 700 and 1,000, most of whom work in the Norwegian coal mines, giving the island its important position today.</p>
<h3>Iranian Government Accepts All Demands from Britain and the Soviet Union; Axis Embassies and Consulates to be Closed; Waterway Transportation Under British and Soviet Control</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tehran, 9th: According to an announcement from the Iranian Prime Minister's office, the embassies of Germany, Italy, and pro-Axis countries will be closed, and all German nationals will be extradited in accordance with the Iranian government's acceptance of British and Soviet demands.</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 9th: An official announcement has been made that the conditions proposed by Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran include British and Soviet control to maintain all waterways from Basra to the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 9th: According to reliable sources, the armistice agreement agreed upon by Britain and Iran allows the Iranian army to continue to maintain its weapons and equipment and will not disarm them.</p>
<h3>German Interests in Iran Entrusted to Sweden for Representation</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 9th: It is declared here that German interests in the areas of Iran occupied by British and Soviet troops have been taken care of by Sweden.</p>
<h3>Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: The House of Commons reconvened today. While reviewing the war situation, the Prime Minister released the progress of the Atlantic war, stating that the total tonnage of British and Allied ships sunk by the enemy in July and August was less than one-third of the tonnage of German and Italian ships sunk by the Allies during the same period. Currently, three or four German aircraft are laying mines in British territorial waters every night, but this hazard has been largely eliminated by mine-sweeping vessels using various exotic equipment. The Prime Minister continued to describe the Soviet-German war, stating that in the past three months, through the fierce resistance of the Soviet Union, the German losses have been more severe than in any year of the last Great War. The German army is bound to spend a severe winter in Soviet territory. The Soviet Union's need for British and American aid is particularly urgent, because although it has 10 million to 15 million soldiers, they all need to be armed and equipped. Currently, a large number of supplies have set out to the Soviet Union. Britain must make great sacrifices for the benefit of the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister finally reiterated the Iranian incident, stating that all German and Italian nationals in the occupied territories must surrender.</p>
<h3>Germany Uses Secret Weapon: Acoustic Mine; Britain Already Has Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today that the German side is now using a secret weapon called "Acoustic Mine", which emits a metallic tone similar to the tone of a ship's engine. When it receives a similar tone, it explodes. He also said that the science and organization of the British Kingdom has largely controlled this new type of mine.</p>
<h3>Germany Applies Both Coercion and Enticement to Turkey; Large Army Gathers on the Turkish-Bulgarian Border; Negotiations for New Trade Agreement Begin</h3>
<p>United Press International, London, 9th: Reliable sources say that the Eastern Front war is currently still tense. It is heard that Hitler is intensifying pressure on Turkey. Although his threat to Turkey is not yet serious, this attempt must have been included in Hitler's timetable for aggression. It is heard that two German mechanized divisions have moved to the Turkish-Bulgarian border. It is also heard that plans to include Turkey in the Axis powers have been discussed in Germany for a long time.</p>
<p>United Press International, Ankara, 9th: German economic expert Dr. Clodius and his entourage of twelve arrived here yesterday morning and formally visited the Turkish Foreign Minister. Preliminary negotiations for a new German-Turkish trade agreement began in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Central Route Red Army Launches Major Counteroffensive, Recaptures Yelnya, Eight Nazi Divisions Defeated</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 9th: The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating that on the 8th, our army fought the enemy along the entire front. In the Smolensk area, the Soviet and German armies fought fiercely for the city of Yelnya (30 miles southeast of Smolensk) for 26 days, defeating eight German divisions. The numbers of the defeated divisions are as follows: the 15th Infantry Regiment, the SS 1st Division, the 17th Motorized Division, the 10th Tank Division, the 137th Infantry Division, and the 178th, 292nd, and 268th Infantry Divisions. The remnants of the enemy are fleeing westward in panic. Our army recaptured the city of Yelnya.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 9th: The Daily Mail published a message from the Swedish capital stating that Marshal Timoshenko urgently dispatched a large army to launch a fierce attack on the German positions in the central line, in order to reduce the terrible pressure from the German army on Marshal Voroshilov in the Leningrad area. Germany urgently dispatched hundreds of dive bombers, which are currently conducting group air raids on the Red Army in the Leningrad area, resulting in a very large air blitz, no less than the battles of Warsaw and Rotterdam.</p>
<h3>Germany Claims Completion of Encirclement of Leningrad; Soviet Defenders Still Receiving Steady Supplies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: The German side claims to have occupied the city east of Leningrad, completing the encirclement of Leningrad and cutting off all land transportation lines to the city. According to a special statement issued by Hitler's headquarters, the German mobile troops, assisted by aircraft, have advanced to the vanguard positions on the Neva River, 29 miles east of Leningrad, and occupied the city of Shlisselburg on Lake Ladoga. However, this news has not been confirmed by other sources. Moscow is also reporting that the Soviet troops under General Voroshilov, guarding Leningrad, are receiving relief from land and air, with supplies coming in steadily. The German radio station still claims that the Soviet troops in the Leningrad area are putting up a strong resistance, and admits that the Soviet troops are fighting for every inch of land, forcing the German army to switch to the defensive.</p>
<h3>Finnish Troops Advance to the Svir River, Threatening the Soviet Far North's Important Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Military commentators say that the statement from the Finnish and German command headquarters that the Finnish troops have advanced to the Svir River (between Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga) appears to threaten the two important supply lines between the Soviet Far North and the west. It has not been stated where exactly the Finnish troops have advanced to the Svir River, nor is their strength clear, but if this statement is true, then the Finnish troops' advance is of no small importance, because the main waterway connecting the White Sea and western Soviet Union, the Stalin Canal, runs along the Svir River, and the railway from Murmansk to the south also passes through the Svir River. In addition to cutting off these transportation lines, the Finnish army is obviously hoping to meet up with the German army east and south of Leningrad, in order to realize the German side's previous boast that Leningrad has been surrounded. However, according to recent news from Moscow, the German army has not yet attacked the east and southeast of Leningrad. Even if the Finnish and German armies are able to meet up, they will not be able to cut off all communication between the Soviet Union's north and the inland, because the northern city of Arkhangelsk still has a good railway running south directly to Moscow. This railway is still 250 miles away from the nearest German troops.</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 9th: A communiqué from Führer Hitler's headquarters stated that the German armored divisions have reached the south shore of Lake Ladoga, only a few miles away from the Finnish troops advancing south.</p>
<h3>German Troops Repeatedly Attempt to Force Crossing of the Dnieper River Without Success; Odessa and Kiev Are Impregnable</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Moscow's communiqué states that the German army's attempts to break through the Dnieper River defenses have all been defeated. According to news from the besieged city of Odessa, the German troops have attacked the local Soviet navy, army, and people's volunteers for 29 days without success. Odessa is now "impregnable," and Kiev has also become a strong stronghold. All residents have participated in the city's defenses, adding to the fortifications. Moscow newspapers report that General Purtini has concentrated his troops in Ukraine, while the German side says that the German army is preparing to repel the Soviet counteroffensive in this area and around Gomel in the central area.</p>
<p>TASS, Odessa, 9th: Fierce fighting has been going on near the city of Odessa for 19 days. The Nazi army's repeated offensives have been shattered by the heroic resistance of the Red Army Navy and the National Army. Under the heavy blows of the Red Army, the enemy's elite troops have suffered heavy casualties. This besieged city has now become an impregnable Soviet fortress, within sight but out of reach for the enemy.</p>
<h3>Nazis Throw All Their Strength into the Eastern Front War, Deploying 34 Divisions</h3>
<p>United Press International, London, 9th: Responsible Allied officials stated yesterday that in the past two weeks the Germans had used 34 divisions to attack the Soviet Union. The Germans had drawn no less than 500,000 soldiers from the occupied territories and Germany, and it was heard that the Soviet army's withdrawal from Tallinn had also allowed the Germans to draw 150,000 soldiers for use elsewhere. It is generally believed that these 150,000 soldiers must have been used to reinforce the offensive on Leningrad, but Voroshilov's troops continue to put up a difficult resistance. However, the German threat to Leningrad has caused the Allied and Soviet officials to become increasingly anxious.</p>
<h3>German Long-Range Gun Shells Dover Port Yesterday; Two Shots Fired Every Few Minutes for Half an Hour; Berlin Heavily Bombed by British Air Force</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th. A German long-range gun, positioned on the French coast, shelled the Dover area of England for half an hour last night. This was the first shelling in several weeks. Several houses were damaged. Each time the enemy gun fired, two shells exploded. When the shelling began, Dover immediately issued a shelling alarm. There was a pause of fifteen minutes, after which the enemy gun fired two shells every few minutes, flying high and landing in the Dover area. The sound of the artillery and the explosion of the shells caused houses within miles of the Kent coast to shake. Observers saw red flashes from the enemy gun firing on Cap Gris-Nez on the opposite shore, illuminating the sea. German anti-aircraft batteries in Calais also fired at British bombers in the sky during the shelling. The sound of a German plane was heard flying over the English Channel, presumably directing the German artillery.</p>
<p>Reuters, 9th. According to a public announcement yesterday afternoon by the Air Ministry, the British Air Force bombed Germany on Sunday night, inflicting damage. Targets in Berlin, Kiel, and elsewhere, as well as shipyards in Cologne, were attacked. The British squadron attacking Berlin was particularly effective. The night was bright with moonlight, and a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped, lasting for two hours. Large fires broke out in many parts of the city, causing significant damage.

<h3>Delegation Visiting Burma Returns to Chongqing via Mandalay and Lashio; Receives Warm Hospitality from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Chinese delegation visiting Burma returned to Chongqing on the evening of the 8th. The delegation flew to Rangoon from Chongqing on the 28th of last month. During their week-long stay in Rangoon, they received a warm welcome and hospitality from the Burmese government, the Burmese Governor, the Burmese people, and the overseas Chinese. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, they traveled by special flower car from Rangoon to Mandalay and arrived there the next morning. The local authorities and overseas Chinese also held a grand welcoming tea party. On the 7th, they traveled by car to Lashio, where the local magistrate, chieftain, and representatives of the overseas Chinese all welcomed them at the station and held a banquet at the China National Aviation Corporation's hostel. Burmese Governor Dorman-Smith telegraphed his best wishes for a safe journey home. The telegram was delivered in person by the local magistrate of Lashio. At 1:00 PM on the 8th, they left Burma by China National Aviation Corporation plane and returned home, landing safely in Kunming at around 3:00 PM. Delegation leader Chiang Meng-lin, deputy leader Miao Jia-ming, and delegation member Jin Long-zhang disembarked in Kunming. Delegation member Hang Li-wu, who also served as secretary-general, Zhang Wei-zhen, Chen Ji-yi, Tang De-chen, and Zhang Xue-qian, who also served as English secretary, continued to fly to Chongqing, arriving safely at the airport at around 7:00 PM. According to Deputy Leader Zeng Yang-fu and delegation member Xie Ren-zhao, they are still in Rangoon due to urgent matters. After returning to Chongqing, Delegation Secretary-General Hang Li-wu said that the delegation received a warm welcome from all parties in Burma. This enthusiasm is a manifestation of the friendship of the Chinese people, and those who have experienced it are particularly grateful. The ease and sincerity of the Burmese people left a deep impression on people. During the eleven days in Burma, we came into contact with no less than thousands of people from all walks of life, but without distinction between government and public, regardless of religion or race, there was a deep understanding of the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity. We went with the friendship of the Chinese people and returned with the goodwill of the Burmese people, which is a source of joy and happiness. The whole country (is consistent in words and actions, and the expectations of the leader and all parties are also almost the same. (Report on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Dissolve Major University; Rectify Academic Morale</h3>
<p>Chengdu. At the Provincial Government Memorial Week meeting on the 8th, Provincial Governor Zhang spoke about the student unrest at the Provincial Chongqing University. He briefly mentioned that Chongqing University was founded by the late Chairman Liu and is the only university in the province. In recent years, academic morale has deteriorated day by day. Whenever there is a change of president, students openly welcome or reject the new appointee, and their actions are perverse. In order to rectify academic morale, the government has had to take decisive measures to dissolve the university and appoint Wu Zexiang and others as supervisory committee members to be responsible for the reorganization. The Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government are now jointly planning the aftermath. This measure is a problem of rectification of the entire academic morale, and it is not only an unavoidable measure for Chongqing University alone. It has also been found that only a small number of students participated in this student unrest. Although the government has dissolved Chongqing University and punished the students who caused the trouble, it will still allow the majority of students who did not participate to continue their studies after registration and inspection.

<h3>Chinese Banks Cooperate Wholeheartedly; All Prepare to Engage in Foreign Exchange; China and Jiaotong Banks Plan Implementation Steps; In Fact, Consistent with Allied Banks; September Tentative Measures for Specially Approved Foreign Exchange Banks Published</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the Measures for Granting Foreign Exchange for Essential Imports, which were promulgated to manage the Shanghai foreign exchange market, by the concerted efforts of fourteen Allied banks, the long-disordered Shanghai trade situation has obviously returned to normal, and the black market for foreign exchange, which has always been a hotbed of speculation, has also been curbed. However, on the part of Chinese national banks, they have been extremely silent on this matter. However, according to reports from the New Voice Agency yesterday, the China and Jiaotong Banks (the Central and Farmers Banks do not engage in foreign exchange, which is handled centrally by the China and Jiaotong Banks) are preparing to take consistent actions with the fourteen Allied banks, and may apply to the Stabilization Fund on behalf of customers for the foreign exchange of essential goods, while also purchasing export bills of exchange from traders. As for the foreign exchange business of Chinese banks, it was balanced on the 15th of last month, and after the Central Bank took over and settled it clearly, it could not continue to engage in foreign exchange. Now, with the special approval of the Stabilization Fund, the Chinese banks may also apply to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange through the China and Jiaotong Banks, and obtain a commission of 0.03125. At this moment, all Chinese banks are negotiating with China and Jiaotong Banks. However, the authorities of the four banks have neither confirmed nor denied the receipt of the order from the Stabilization Fund transferred by the head office. However, in fact, what the four banks are currently doing is completely no different from the measures taken by the fourteen foreign banks in accordance with the order of the Stabilization Fund.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks - Unified Action</p>
<p>The unified action of Chinese national banks and Chinese banks will be evidenced by the announcement of the Stabilization Fund. This announcement was issued the day before yesterday afternoon. In addition to declaring that the purpose of the Stabilization Conference was to meet with representatives of British and American banks to exchange views on the recent developments caused by the British and American government freeze measures, it also emphasized that the British and American banking circles have decided to buy and sell foreign exchange at the Stabilization Fund exchange rate, and all Chinese banks have also promised to cooperate wholeheartedly. The announcement concluded by saying that the methods and understandings agreed upon have made substantial progress, and the British and American financial departments will also make every effort to cooperate so that the Stabilization Fund can obtain news or information related to the British and American government freeze decrees. The US government will also specially dispatch personnel to reside in China and Hong Kong to handle this matter. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign banks in this city expressed their sincere welcome to the Stabilization Fund's resolution and the announcement, and all were determined to abide by the authorities' orders to strengthen the organization and implementation efficiency of foreign exchange management in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Managing the Exchange Market - All Express Support</p>
<p>Because the Chinese banks are also allowed to manage foreign exchange transactions through the China and Jiaotong Banks, they also expressed their support for the implementation of foreign exchange management. The foreign exchange business of Chinese banks was balanced on the 15th of last month, and after the Central Bank took over and settled it clearly, it could no longer buy and sell foreign exchange due to the lack of a special note from the US government. However, according to the new regulations, all Chinese banks can still apply to the Stabilization Fund for legal foreign exchange through the China and Jiaotong Banks on behalf of customers, and obtain the commission of 0.03125 that should have been obtained by the China and Jiaotong Banks. When importers request the supply of foreign exchange from various Chinese banks, they must first fill in the relevant items on the application form, which will be collected by the original handling bank and submitted to China or Jiaotong. China and Jiaotong will fill in the guarantee item and then send it to the Stabilization Fund. In this case, the importer is responsible to the original handling Chinese bank, the Chinese bank is responsible to China and Jiaotong, and China and Jiaotong is responsible to the Stabilization Fund. If the Stabilization Fund subsequently finds that the application does not meet the regulations, but the foreign exchange has been approved, it may order the closest responsible bank to recover the foreign exchange that has been granted.</p>
<p>Arbitrage and Profit-Taking - Impossible to Achieve</p>
<p>With the implementation of the Shanghai foreign exchange management measures, the loopholes in the US and British freeze orders are gradually being filled. Under these conditions, the black market for foreign exchange will naturally disappear, and any arbitrage attempts will be impossible to achieve. This method can obviously prevent the unwarranted outflow of Chinese funds, but it has no impact on legitimate and legal import trade. As for profit-taking, it has always been the focus of attention for speculative merchants, who use the difference between spot and futures or futures of various months to make profits. Now, under the control of the Stabilization Fund, there is naturally no difference in exchange rates. Even the black exchange rate, which currently has a price but no market, is due to the efforts of the Stabilization Fund and various banks. This difference, which gives speculators good opportunities, no longer exists. As for yesterday's black exchange rate, the spot and futures prices for British exchange were 2 pence 859375, and the current futures price for US exchange was 4 yuan 84375. This prohibition of arbitrage and profit-taking will definitely have a stabilizing effect on the entire exchange market.</p>
<p>The Black Market Still Attempts to Survive</p>
<p>The issue of the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange still attracts the attention of many people, and yesterday's rumors that "the black market will be traded by exporters and import firms negotiating a median price" is just an attempt by speculative merchants who attempt to extend the life of the black exchange. However, according to people in related banks, this move is difficult to implement. The reason why the black market is generated is that the buyer is sucking in from the importers, and the seller is throwing out from the exporters. Now, on the one hand, the Stabilization Fund stipulates that foreign exchange is supplied for the import of essential goods or small trade, so there is no need for importers to suck in from the black market again. On the other hand, it is stipulated that exporters must sell their export bills of exchange to any one of the fourteen Allied banks and the China and Jiaotong Banks, otherwise they will be refused foreign exchange for import. Therefore, in order to maintain the right to obtain foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund when importing, exporters are naturally unwilling to throw out their export bills of exchange to the black market. For this reason, the curbing and elimination of the black market is extremely reasonable, and the random release of rumors by general speculators only shows that their efforts are increasingly exhausted. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. How to settle the foreign exchange for the import of prohibited goods and non-essential luxury goods in the future is another matter. This is different in nature from the speculative behavior of the black market for foreign exchange in the past, and since there is a standard for legal foreign exchange, it is difficult to deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>Hawkins and Mackay Return to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Hawkins, General Manager of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and Mackay, Supervisor of Citibank, who went to Hong Kong from Shanghai to participate in the Stabilization Conference, have completed the conference in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai on the American President Lines' President Cleveland. They are expected to arrive here this morning. Mr. Hawkins is the Chairman of the Shanghai Foreign Banks Association. This decision was made to go to Hong Kong to represent the foreign banks to express their opinions and promise to buy and sell foreign exchange at the Stabilization Fund exchange rate, which is welcomed by all parties. Mr. Mackay is the leader of the American banks and also has considerable influence. The two men will return to Shanghai together, which will undoubtedly make a more practical contribution to the Shanghai exchange market. As for Dr. Taylor, the American assistant of the Stabilization Fund, who went to Hong Kong before the two men, and Hall-Patch, the British commissioner who left Shanghai after the two men, they will not come to Shanghai in the short term because they still have to stay in Hong Kong to discuss various issues with American Commissioner Fox.</p>
<p>Tentative Measures - Reportedly Promulgated</p>
<p>It is reported that the Stabilization Fund Committee yesterday authorized the Chartered Bank to issue the "September Tentative Measures for Specially Approved Foreign Exchange Banks." It details the methods for approving foreign exchange to importers and individuals applying for foreign exchange. The measures also contain the list of two items announced on Monday. The import of these items can be applied for a limited amount of US exchange or British exchange from the Stabilization Fund by specially approved or licensed banks in this city. The tentative measures contain a clause stipulating that each bank shall settle foreign exchange only at the legal exchange rate and shall not directly or indirectly engage in the buying and selling of other exchange rates. The items listed in the measures, List A, stipulate that food rice, tobacco leaves, petroleum products, and coal are subject to certain restrictions, limited to the amount needed in this city. List B contains many items (annotated with the 1934 Customs Import Tariff Number), including cotton, cotton yarn and thread, wool and wool waste, electrical machinery for transmission and power generation, milk and cheese, and flour and grain products. Although there are hundreds of items included in List B that can be applied for foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate, according to a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency who met with a member of the banking community yesterday, it is said that there are countless items that are not included in the list, and their continued import is related to the prosperity of Shanghai's industry and commerce. In addition, checks that expire in September and have not yet been settled may be supplied with foreign exchange, but special foreign currency guarantees held by banks and importers are not included. The supply of foreign exchange should be reported to the Stabilization Fund.</p>
<h3>American Businesses Close for Half a Day Today; Mourn Mrs. Roosevelt; American Chamber of Commerce Issued a Notice Last Night</h3>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt, the mother of US President Roosevelt, passed away at Hyde Park at 11:15 AM on the 7th. The funeral will be held on the fixed day and she will be buried in the cemetery of St. James' Church in the park, which is also the burial place of President Roosevelt's father. The American Chamber of Commerce in this city issued a notice to its members last night to close for half a day this afternoon to show their condolences.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Discusses Supplementing; Coal Needed by Factories; If There is a Clue, It Can Be Shipped in One and a Half Months; Electricity Surcharge Can Also Be Cancelled at That Time</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that if Shanghai can obtain a sufficient amount of bituminous coal from North China to supplement the current annual shortage of 600,000 to 700,000 tons, the major issue of the rising cost of living in this city can be satisfactorily resolved. It is now disclosed that the issue of shipping more coal into Shanghai is currently being discussed by the Public Works Department and the Japanese side.</p>
<p>The Electricity Company is Also Negotiating</p>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company has also negotiated with the Japanese side in the hope of obtaining a sufficient amount of bituminous coal for power generation, but has not yet received a reply. However, it is believed that the Japanese military and naval authorities are now planning to take some steps in this regard. If the Japanese authorities allow Shanghai to ship in enough coal, it will greatly reduce electricity bills, which will benefit all manufacturers greatly, and the high prices of goods are also expected to fall back together. According to responsible parties,</p>
<p>The Amount of Coal Needed is Limited</p>
<p>Even if half of the coal that Shanghai lacks each year, that is, 300,000 to 400,000 tons, is shipped in, the situation can be greatly improved, and general prices will almost certainly fall accordingly. The amount of coal currently shipped into Shanghai is about 2 million tons per year, which is about 500,000 tons less than the amount needed. The Shanghai Power Company was previously able to supply its own coal for power generation, but in the past eight months, it has been difficult to obtain a normal amount of coal, so coal consumption has had to be reduced. If the company can obtain more coal, there is hope of reducing or eliminating the current electricity surcharge, and manufacturers will benefit from cheaper electricity, and the cost of the goods they produce will also be reduced, which will be beneficial in all aspects. Even Japanese-owned spinning mills and factories here, although they have found ways to obtain the coal they need from a certain direction, will also benefit from the reduction in electricity bills.</p>
<p>The Coal Can be Shipped in One and a Half Months</p>
<p>It is heard that a major difficulty in Shanghai's acquisition of more coal is the current shortage of ships. However, if the Japanese authorities decide to cooperate in the difficulties currently encountered in Shanghai, there are still ships that can be allocated to transport coal to Shanghai. If so, as long as ships with a load of 8,000 tons are dedicated to transporting coal to Shanghai, 400,000 tons of coal can be transported in one and a half months. As for household coal for this winter, it is heard that all parties have not yet taken steps to remedy the situation. The Kailan Mining Administration and the Hongji Coal Company are currently shipping coal to Shanghai on schedule, but it is not known whether they will be able to obtain a sufficient amount of coal to meet the household needs of the city.</p>
<h3>Russian Ship "Soviet" Sails to Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Of the Russian ships that came to Shanghai for repairs, there were originally as many as six, and now they have been repaired one after another and left Shanghai. Yesterday, the Soviet (SS Sovet) was also repaired and completed, and weighed anchor at around 2:00 PM yesterday and left Wusongkou at 4:30 PM to return to Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Expands Telephones; New Users Please Install Telephones; Lines Can Be Connected Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company of the Public Concession has greatly increased its business revenue since increasing the connection fee. However, due to the insufficient allocation of the original lines, and the abnormal prosperity of the households, the demand for telephones from various industries has increased. However, due to the war, raw materials have not been able to be replenished, so all plans have not been able to be realized. Now, the company has shipped some materials to Shanghai, so the company has specially expanded the connection stations of "No. 1," "No. 7," "No. 8," "No. 9," "No. 3," and "No. 6." At the same time, it is also actively laying overhead cables. Once completed, they will be installed separately according to the order of the user's request to facilitate the application of citizens. All projects are generally expected to be completed in the next month.</p>
<h3>President Cleveland Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, several large American President Lines ships will arrive in Shanghai one after another in the next ten days. It is heard that the President Cleveland will sail from Manila to Shanghai this morning. The ship has a large amount of American crushed wheat and is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one night and leave Shanghai on the 11th. It is learned that there will be 150 American expatriates, most of whom recently evacuated from Japan on the Ryuta Maru, who will take the ship back to the United States. In addition, Hal Reynolds, secretary of the American YMCA, will also return to the United States. It is also learned that the US government is still adhering to its consistent policy on the expatriation work in the Far East, and all expatriates who return to their home countries are still those who voluntarily leave.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Water Charges for Boiled Water Shops is Under Discussion</h3>
<p>The Boiled Water Shop Industry Association continued to petition the Public Works Department of the Public Concession at 2:00 PM yesterday, requesting that the water company be instructed to provide preferential water supply or change the calculation method. The representative of the authorities agreed to try their best to find a solution and asked them to wait for orders and consult with the water company. All representatives then left.</p>
<p>Comparison of Water Charges</p>
<p>The charges of the French Water Company have always been cheaper than those of the British Water Company. Before September 6, 1939, it only charged 8 fen and 7 li (silver calculation) per degree (ie one cubic meter). After September 6 of the same year, the above price was increased by 10%. After November 6 of the same year, it was increased by another 30%. After January 26, 1941, the price was increased by 49%. After April 26, 1941, the price was increased by 75%. The current charge is 3 jiao and 2 fen per cubic meter, which is significantly different from the charges of the British Water Company. Therefore, it is hoped that the British Water Company's charges for boiled water shops will also be charged according to the company's charging method.</p>
<p>Ping Coal Sale</p>
<p>Ping coal used by boiled water shops has now been agreed upon by the Kailan Mining Administration, and it has been decided to sell the remaining 300 tons of No. 3 coal slag at a flat price. Each household is limited to half a ton, and each ton is sold for 100 yuan in national currency, which is 20 yuan more than before. It has now been set to begin selling from (1) bathhouses on the 12th, (2) boiled water shops from the 13th to the 15th.</p>
<h3>Indian Residents Leave Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Company's Tai Sheng Lun has moved from the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow, sailing to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Calcutta. It is heard that the first-class cabins of the ship have been booked long ago, but most of the Indian residents are taking the third-class cabins. It is heard that the total number of Indian residents leaving Shanghai this time has increased to more than 200, and there is also a second batch preparing to leave Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Emergency Plague Hospital: This Summer's Treatment Results</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Plague Hospital, run by the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, is located west of the Xiaocaichang (Small Vegetable Market) on North Henan Road. Since its opening on July 10th, it has not charged any fees. As a result, hundreds of patients have sought treatment there daily. Among them, 97 patients suffered from genuine cholera (40 men, 45 women, and 12 children). Except for Sun Zhu's, who died from puerperal sepsis combined with uremia after a miscarriage, and Liu Xiaogou, who died because he was sent to the hospital too late for treatment, 71 others who had received saline injections have fully recovered and been discharged. Those still hospitalized have passed the critical period and are no longer in danger of losing their lives.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting will be held this Thursday (September 11th, noon) at the Race Club, 304 Rue Massenet. The program has been set: Mr. Yinson See, a Hong Kong member who is back in Shanghai for a short rest, will give a speech on "China and the Philippine Islands." Those who wish to attend should contact the club secretary at telephone number 16450 before noon on Wednesday to reserve a seat.</p>
<h3>US Court Marshal Thai Kiao Pang Accused of Stealing and Selling Public Property; Prosecutor Hills Officially Indicts; Detective Testifies at Continued Trial</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Special Marshal Rudun of the U.S. Court for China held a hearing today (the 9th) to investigate the case of Thai Tuo Pang, the former Deputy Executive Officer of the court, for stealing and selling public property. The defendant, Thai Tuo Pang, was escorted to the court by two police officers from the Police Department. He looked pale and quite uneasy, and smiled bitterly at his lawyer, Copts. Prosecutor Hills, representing the U.S. government, accused the defendant of stealing and selling public property.</p>
<p>Breach of Trust</p>
<p>It was stated that the defendant, while temporarily replacing the Executive Officer Li Quesun during his absence from Shanghai, had the authority to sign salary checks for court personnel and to safeguard public firearms and ammunition. He then took the opportunity to privately take two Colt .18-caliber handguns and 300 rounds of ammunition to a friend's house at 91 Dianmi Road, to discuss selling them. His friend then took the guns and ammunition and sold them to a Chinese person for 4,400 yuan in Chinese currency, all in cash, including some hundred-yuan notes. The defendant received 3,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Selling Firearms Illegally</p>
<p>He then returned to the court to get ammunition to give to his friend. This ammunition was also part of the transaction. It was decided that the defendant would deposit the money into his personal account at Citibank, but the bank did not accept hundred-yuan notes. The defendant also accompanied another person in an official car to Dianmi Road and then went elsewhere before returning to the Hui Zhong Hotel. According to the inventory list of the Executive Officer's office, the defendant stole and sold a total of eight firearms.</p>
<p>Heavy Debt</p>
<p>The defendant was already heavily in debt when he joined the court and became increasingly mired in it. This was the motive for his theft and sale of firearms. Therefore, the court should find the defendant guilty. The defendant's lawyer, Copts, continued to claim that he would defend the defendant at the next hearing. The prosecutor then called Wal, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police, to testify. Wal stated that among the nine handguns registered at the Ziccawei station, he recognized one as belonging to the U.S. Court.</p>
<p>Detective's Testimony</p>
<p>He reported this to the Deputy Director of the Police Department and then went to the court to meet with Executive Officer Li Quesun. Since Li had left Shanghai, he met with Thai Tuo Pang. The defendant initially pretended to investigate, then said the next day that he had given the gun to a Chinese person and asked him to keep it secret. Later, the defendant said that he needed more time. The aforementioned details are all from [his testimony]. After the evidence was presented, the judge announced a continuance for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Swedish Sailors Sail in Rowboat Across Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that a type of yacht, the "Ella," often participates in rowing races held by the Shanghai Rowing Club on the Huangpu River. Last Sunday, it was suddenly seen leaving the Wusong estuary and sailing down the Yangtze River. It is said to be heading to Manila. The boat flies the Swedish flag and is crewed by three Swedish sailors. They hope to eventually cross the Pacific Ocean, with San Francisco as their final destination. Rowing experts in Shanghai believe that the Swedish sailors' courageous attempt to sail a yacht across the ocean is extremely dangerous and requires luck to reach Manila safely. It cannot be achieved solely through navigational skills. The final attempt to cross the entire Pacific Ocean is extremely perilous.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Arrest a Person at a Place on Route Ratard</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 a.m., the Japanese military police sent five plainclothes military police officers in vehicles with military license plates 255 and 2023 and black license plates to the Louza Police Station of the French General Police to request a detective to accompany them to a house on Route Ratard. There, they arrested a Chinese man in his thirties, wearing a pai-li-sze (派力斯) long gown, and took him back to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>It was also reported that at 8:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the Japanese sent personnel to escort a Chinese person to the French police station, requesting a detective to accompany them to guard and arrest a certain Chinese person in front of the Gu'en Temple on Route Vouillemont. As a result, they did not catch him.</p>

<h3>Central Police Detective Yamaguchi Suddenly Attacked; Shot on Tram, Bullet Enters Abdomen, Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a shooting incident occurred at the tram stop near the Jade Buddha Temple at Route Gordon and Rue Pingliang in the Public Concession. The victim was Yamaguchi, a Japanese detective with the Public Concession Police Department. He was shot in the back, and the bullet penetrated his abdomen. His life is in critical condition. The details of the shooting are as follows:</p>
<p>Serving for Many Years, Promoted to Detective</p>
<p>Yamaguchi, Japanese badge number 611 of the Public Concession Municipal Police Department, is about 40 years old. He previously served at the Route Gordon Police Station in the Western District and was later transferred to the Central Police Station on Foochow Road, where he was responsible for criminal cases involving Japanese residents. He is fluent in Chinese and English and resides in the Guangming Village on Route Gordon. Recently, he was promoted to detective (探目) due to his success in handling cases. He routinely commuted to the police station by tram.</p>
<p>Waiting at the Station, Suddenly Attacked</p>
<p>At 8:40 a.m. yesterday, Yamaguchi finished breakfast at home, wearing a gray suit. He walked to the tram station near the Jade Buddha Temple on Route Gordon and Rue Pingliang to wait for the tram to go to the police station. Unexpectedly, there were five men lying in wait. One of them suddenly opened fire on Yamaguchi's back, firing three shots in an attempt to assassinate him. Yamaguchi was caught off guard, and a bullet penetrated his abdomen, causing him to collapse in a pool of blood with serious injuries.</p>

<p>After the police station received the news, they sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. The assassin had disappeared. An ambulance was used to send him to Fumin Hospital for treatment. The hospital sent him to Ward 1, a first-class ward on the fourth floor, and used X-rays to locate the bullet. They discovered that it was still lodged in his abdomen, making it extremely difficult to remove. Therefore, Yamaguchi's life is in extreme danger. The police station is currently investigating the details of the case. The recovered bullet casings have also been examined by specialists for clues.</p>
<h3>Shui On Lane, Route D'aghion; Landlord Cuts Off Water; Sues for Eviction After Years of Litigation; Selling in Sections Forces Tenants to Leave</h3>
<p>The entire property of Shui On Lane, Route D'aghion in the Public Concession, originally named Wenxiang Lane, was taken over by the landlord Wai Yan Tong (懷仁堂) in September of last year and renamed. It immediately appointed lawyer Lu Qi to sue all the tenants in the First Special District Court in the name of recovering the property for their own use, requesting a court order for eviction. The litigation has been ongoing for nearly a year. The landlord, knowing they were in the wrong, withdrew the original lawsuit from the court. However, in August of this year, they still hired a lawyer to publish advertisements in the newspapers, offering the houses in Shui On Lane for sale in sections. After advertising in various newspapers, the houses were quickly sold out. However, the new owners, unable to move in immediately, negotiated with the former landlord, Wai Yan Tong. Wai Yan Tong, disregarding the livelihoods of the residents, cut off the water supply to the entire lane on the morning of the 4th of this month, and it has been six days. All the tenants are complaining incessantly. Yesterday afternoon, the tenants held a public meeting and decided to, in addition to appealing to the police and various sectors of society to uphold justice, appoint Tao Zaiming as their chief representative and hire lawyer Ge Zhitan as their legal counsel to seek legal protection and demand that the landlord Wai Yan Tong restore the water supply to protect public life.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Chase a Man, Escapes at Last, Drops a Cigarette Can, Turns Out to be a Bomb</h3>
<p>At 9:20 p.m. last night, two Japanese military police officers were patrolling on East and West Seward Road in Hongkou when they saw a man in front of them wearing a long gown, in his twenties, walking slowly and acting suspiciously. They intended to go forward to search him, but the man noticed them and immediately ran away. The Japanese military police officers pursued him closely. While chasing him to the vicinity of Laojie on Yuanfang Road, a lead cigarette can suddenly fell from the man's gown onto the road. The Japanese military police officers picked it up and examined it. They realized that it was a homemade bomb and were greatly shocked. They continued to pursue him, but the man had disappeared. Afterwards, the Japanese sealed off the bridges over the Suzhou Creek and conducted a thorough search in the vicinity of the incident, but found nothing. It is said that the bridges were opened at midnight.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Chinese Constable Turns to Banditry</h3>
<p>A certain surname family, resident at 4 Wen Yuan Fang, Pi Sao Nai Road outside the Little North Gate of the French Concession, is a rice merchant whose family has been accumulating a considerable amount of wealth and caused bandits to salivate at the mouth. At 10 p.m. the night before, suddenly four or five bandits broke in, holding handguns, and robbed them of more than 2,000 yuan in cash and a gold watch. As the bandits were fleeing with their loot, the victim followed behind them. At the intersection of Min Ti Ni Yin Road, a detective named Shen Lianfang happened to be passing by and received the victim's report. He stepped forward and caught one of the bandits, seizing a handgun. The bandit confessed that his last name was Jin, and that he had previously been a patrolman in a certain unit of the French police force, but that he had now turned to banditry. Later, three more accomplices were apprehended in the Zaojiao Du area in Western Shanghai and taken back to the police station for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Looking for a Lost Girl</h3>
<p>A local girl named Gao Xi (高錫) (nickname Xiaohaoren), 11 years old, wearing a red floral cotton short shirt and pants, and yellow sneakers, was separated from her family at the intersection of Connaught Road and Xiaoshadu Road at 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 8th). Despite attempts to find her, she is still missing. Her father only works odd jobs and cannot afford to search extensively. It is hoped that anyone who is keeping her or encounters her will notify No. 156, Lane 577, Connaught Road, or Gao Fulin, the tea room attendant at the China United Press, telephone number 91831.</p>

<h3>Orphanage Hosting Tea Dance Fundraiser, To Be Held on the 14th of This Month at the Lido Ballroom</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Orphanage has been established for nearly four years. Since Mr. Gao Huailiang took over as director in March of this year, he has been determined to innovate and actively reorganize, so that the affairs of the hospital have been improving day by day. Recently, due to soaring prices and increased expenses, although efforts have been made to raise more than 200,000 yuan, it is still inevitable that there is a shortage of funds to educate and care for 500 orphans. Therefore, with the common support of social celebrities and enthusiastic people, a tea dance fundraiser has been launched, scheduled to be held at the Lido Ballroom on Route Medhurst at 3:30 p.m. on the 14th of this month. All the top stars of the Shanghai dance world have been hired to participate in the dancing, and the ballroom's band will perform famous songs, as well as performances by the orphans, including the Little Mermaid, the National Flower Dance, a one-act play, and many others. At that time, the fragrance of clothes and hairpins will make it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Grain: Permission to Supply Foreign Rice with Foreign Exchange Unexpectedly Becomes Pretext for Price Increase; Rice Merchants' Intentions Truly Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially rose and then fell, and the market price was seen to be consolidating again. The market opened in the morning carrying the upward trend from the previous day, and buying interest was very strong. This is because rice merchants always want prices to rise. The government has agreed to provide foreign exchange for the purchase of foreign rice for Shanghai, originally for the sake of the people's food supply, not to make the rice merchants rich. With this assistance, it would have been possible to stabilize public sentiment and level out grain prices. However, the rice merchants took this as an excuse to raise prices, arguing that even if all approvals were granted, only 150,000 to 200,000 bags could be obtained. Regardless of whether their calculations are accurate, it should be known that with this new order of 200,000 bags per month, plus the nearly 2 million bags of rice in stock, and the new rice that will be entering the market successively, there is more than enough. Logically speaking, in the next six months, there will be no need to order 100,000 to 200,000 bags of rice per month. Therefore, if the rice merchants make various excuses, the foreign exchange that is approved for supply can be used exclusively for ordering publicly sold rice. However, the rice merchants yesterday used the excuse that the approved foreign exchange was insufficient to purchase rice, seizing the opportunity to stir up trouble. The rice price surged again, and prices rose speculatively. The "football" momentum was greatly boosted, and the market price was immediately kicked up by three or four yuan. English and Chinese warehouses on Xiaojia Road were priced at 137.56 yuan, and spot prices were about 132 to 133.5 yuan. Broken rice was priced at 95.70 to 96 yuan for large quantities, and 97 to 97.5 yuan for high-quality rice, making it more sought after than spot rice. The small quantity of English and Chinese rice had already risen the night before, and in the morning, it opened at 110.05 yuan from 108 yuan. Other goods followed suit. However, as the price was high, those who had profits took them, and the market price fell again by one or two yuan in the afternoon due to the favorable situation for the United States in the Far East, which was very unfavorable to the bullish side. In the end, it only increased by one to three yuan. The number of transactions increased to nearly 30,000 bags, or 800 to 900 tons.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 8th) in the evening, carrying 2,070 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and unloaded at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession. Jardine Matheson's Fao Seng Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,568 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and unloaded at the Roosevelt Pier. In addition to transporting a small amount of foreign rice, Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel will transport a large batch of foreign rice to Qingdao today. The city will also load an additional 1,500 bags for Qingdao. (Zu)</p>
<p>The local market for thick and thin japonica rice (粳米) also saw increased activity. The arrival of goods is still limited, so the price has increased by one or two yuan due to the cargo owner's reluctance to sell. Early indica rice (早稻) from Guannan Port opened at 153.5 yuan, but was finalized at 150 yuan. Wuxi white japonica rice was 150 yuan, and Pudong new japonica rice was 153 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of glutinous rice has been scarce recently. In addition to the surge in foreign rice, both buyers and sellers have a bullish attitude. As the sporadic demand is quite good, with large buyers absorbing the supply every day, those holding goods are also shouting aggressively. As a result, the market price has increased by one to three yuan. The Zhente Tuanli sold for up to 129 yuan, the average quality opened high from 126 to 127 yuan, and was finalized at 113 yuan, Zhongguan was 121 yuan, and Glutinous Tea was 113 to 114 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Riding High to Sell Back Out; Batch of Canadian Wheat Being Negotiated</h3>
<p>The market for foreign flour was stimulated by rumors in the early market, raising prices by three to five cents. It was said that although the price of foreign flour had been agreed upon, it could not be finalized due to the inability to settle foreign exchange. Speculators took the opportunity to become active. Jinlong West Warehouse opened at 31.5 yuan and rose to 31.7 yuan, East Warehouse rose from 31.95 yuan to 32.2 yuan, and the Pao Tai rose to 33.23 yuan. However, in the flourishing market, there were those who took profits and sold back out, so the market had already stabilized by noon. Then, because of the spread of peaceful talk, which was unfavorable to the bullish side, market sentiment softened again, and selling interest increased again. The market could not withstand it and fell again. Moreover, although there were no firm orders for foreign flour, the price of foreign wheat was decreasing, and foreign merchants had a guarantee of handling foreign exchange, and it was also rumored that a batch of Canadian wheat was being negotiated. Therefore, the Pao Tai American flour fell to a closing price of 32.85 yuan, Jinlong East Warehouse was 31.8 yuan, and West Warehouse was 21.3 yuan, all similar to the previous close. Local flour also had 200 to 300 bags, opening at 34.12 yuan. The number of transactions in foreign flour was more than 30,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: Qingdao Crude Oil; Direct Deals Heard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of edible oil fell sharply. The actual sales were still slow, and there were still a few sources arriving at the port. In addition, rumors were unfavorable, causing many people to sell, so the price could not withstand the downward trend. As a result, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil fell sharply by seven or eight yuan compared to the previous day. A total of more than 6,000 dan of Ta You brand refined oil for delivery in September were sold on the unified market, priced at 178 to 173 yuan. In addition, more than 4,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua factory were sold, priced at 179 to 172 yuan. It was heard that there were direct transactions in Qingdao crude oil, with varying prices. It was also rumored that a certain party had taken in a large quantity of rapeseed oil, priced at 170 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 10th, 615 bags of soybeans were exported, transported to Hong Kong, and 300 bags were transported to Singapore. Another 180 bags of sesame seeds were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gangs of Merchants Are Rising to Activity; Cash Fluctuations Day by Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market was stagnant and weak, with little change. Due to the selling by gold shops, remittance shops, and securities shops, the price only ranged from 13 yuan high or low, ending at 5 yuan. The total volume of transactions did not reach 1,000 taels. The cash market was strong, exceeding 1,000 taels, first rising sharply and then falling, because Hong Kong gold was reported to be small. Hong Kong, Tianjin, Chaozhou and other gangs of merchants were rising to activity, causing the fluctuations to be even greater. In the morning, starting with Cheng Ji selling 20 taels to De Fu, priced at 9,200 yuan, the price immediately rose by 10 yuan. De Fu then bought 60 taels from the gold shop, for 9,235 yuan. Xiang He sold 10 taels to Tian Yuan, for 9,230 yuan. De Fu then bought 10 taels from Xin Yuan, and Dingsheng bought 10 taels from Fu Kang Yong, rising to 9,250 yuan. The Tianjin gang Yifeng sold 70 taels to Zhong Yu, for 9,230 yuan. Tian Yuan bought 40 taels from Xiang He, for 5,250 yuan. Dafeng bought 10 taels from Yifeng, for 9,270 yuan, and then bought 10 taels from Hesheng, for 9,260 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from Zhongxing for 9,300 yuan. Yifeng then sold 50 taels to Yongcheng, for 9,270 yuan. De Fu bought 10 taels from Xin Yuan, for 9,290 yuan. Yongcheng bought from Xiang He, and Yifeng each bought 50 taels, Hengji bought from Yiyuan, and Zhongxing each bought 10 taels, for 9,300 yuan. Hengji then bought 10 taels from Zhongxing, for 9,320 yuan, and then bought 30 taels from Yifeng, for 9,315 yuan. The Chaozhou gang bought 10 taels from Dafeng and Zhongxing each, for 9,320 yuan. De Fu bought 10 taels from Tian Yuan, reaching a high of 9,350 yuan. Decheng bought 40 taels from Cheng Ji, and 10 taels from Tian Yuan, for 9,340 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from Cheng Ji, and 10 taels each from Dafeng and Xin Yuan, for 9,350 yuan. Cheng Ji sold 10 taels to Tian Yuan, for 9,300 yuan, and then sold 10 taels, and Dafeng sold 20 taels, all bought by Zhongxing, for 9,290 yuan. Hong Kong gold was reported to be small, and market sentiment softened further. Xiang He sold 150 taels on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, and Tong Kang Yong sold 100 taels, for 9,270 yuan. Zhongxing sold 150 taels, and Cheng Ji sold 20 taels, for 9,260 yuan. Hesheng sold 10 taels for 9,250 yuan, and Yi Da sold 30 taels for 9,260 yuan, all bought by De Fu.

The price was down 10 yuan from the previous day, with a difference of 170 yuan. Transactions of 1,000 taels of gold jewelry first rose 20 yuan, then returned to level, still 940 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Fluctuations Less</p>
<p>Starting at 9:15 a.m., the October contract (ten taels) opened at 6,880 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. The Tian Yuan bulls continuously added to their positions, rising to 6,885 yuan, which was sold by Xin Yuan, De Da, Xinfeng Yong.

In the afternoon, De Fu sold 40 taels to Tian Yuan, for 6,875 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. There was no change until 3:20 p.m. Hengji bought 30 taels, rising to 6,878 yuan.

The selling price of cash gold from the own brand was 9,200 yuan, and the purchase price was 200 yuan lower than the selling price. The current gold bid still has no price and no market.</p>

<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver stores, both Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng, increased by 10 yuan at 10:00 a.m., and then increased by 10 yuan again at 10:30 a.m., to 960 yuan. At 11:00 a.m., it decreased by 10 yuan, and at 12:00 p.m., it decreased by another 10 yuan, finally settling at 940 yuan, leveling out. The purchase price decreased by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Foreign Exchange Unsable to Buy and Sell, Market Condition Cold</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for foreign exchange, the Central Bank and HSBC's two listed prices and the black market prices for U.S. dollars at HSBC's small counter have stabilized. As for the black market for British and American foreign exchange, there is still little hope for development. According to an unconfirmed rumour, a certain foreign bank had sold spot U.S. dollars for 4.875 yuan, which was purchased by an unofficial import and export company, or on behalf of Chinese merchants speculators. Enquiries to HSBC, Citibank and other banks refused to quote. Brokers gradually became cold. The great British currency is still 2 shillings 859375 pence, the U.S. dollar is 4.84375 yuan, with no increase or decrease compared with the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Stagnant</p>
<p>Hong Kong 9th (Tuesday) telegram: This morning the exchange market opening was exceptionally sluggish, the Shanghai exchange and Japanese exchange have not yet opened, there is a market without transactions, and there are no ups and downs in the rest.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Exchange Tight</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>#### Buying on Dips, Selling on Rallies; Yarn Market Still Rides the Waves; Futures Especially Chaotic, Near Months Up, Far Months Down</p>
<p>The yarn market initially rose, then leveled off, but yarn prices remain high due to raw material issues and the relatively stable prices of mixed-brand yarns, fostering positive sentiment. However, actual transactions have not seen significant growth. News suggests strong demand from Southeast Asia, boosting cotton cloth transactions. Some also say factories may further reduce production, encouraging well-funded entities to continue buying on dips. After several days of substantial gains, today's opening was high, prompting profit-takers to sell, causing the market to quickly decline. Nonetheless, cotton yarn fundamentals remain solid. 20-count Double Horse yarn traded at a high of $1772 and a low of $1742. Afternoon trading started at $1746, gradually rising to $1758 before closing slightly lower at $1751. The yarn market may now consolidate. Trading volume on the exchange improved in the afternoon, with cotton cloth up $0.14 and yarn for distant delivery up $9. Today, 875 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse futures opened strong, continuing the upward momentum from the previous afternoon, with robust buying interest. The opening price was $1765, subsequently rising to $1769 due to short covering. However, profit-takers mostly sold off, causing the price to drop to $1753-54. News of a small opening on the exchange and a sharp rise in cotton cloth prices reignited market enthusiasm, with buyers rushing in, pushing the price to $1772. Later, as the exchange market declined and short sellers became active again, selling pressure increased, causing a sharp drop to $1742. However, major players entered the market on the dips, pushing the price back up to $1752 at closing. Trading volume for the half-day totaled 8010 bales. The quantities purchased by various trading groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 60 Tongxing: 8,000</p>
<p>Total: 8,060</p>
<p>The Jinbian Double Horse futures market was chaotic, lacking the upward momentum of the previous day. Despite continued progress in U.S. cotton, the futures market was volatile due to rumors and speculation on the exchange, causing near-month and far-month contracts to fluctuate rapidly. In the morning, factory orders initially rose on the strength of foreign cotton, driving up futures prices with ample buying interest. September contracts rose sharply by $15 to $1655. However, midway through trading, negative rumors caused a sudden downturn in factory orders, weakening futures prices. October contracts opened at $1665, down $6.50, before rebounding as retail investors bought on the dips. November contracts opened at $1695, a slight increase of $2. Later, prices fluctuated erratically. Near-month contracts rose at the afternoon close, while far-month contracts weakened. Afternoon trading remained indecisive, with trading groups largely influenced by factory order shifts, resulting in mixed performance. The high and low prices for the day varied between $15 and $25. As a result, September contracts closed at $1653, up $13, while October contracts closed at $162, down $9, and November contracts closed at $1681, a slight increase of $2. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain and Wind Will Greatly Diminish the New Cotton Crop</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market has suddenly become active. Recent weather conditions, with frequent wind and rain and the previous month's storms, have severely damaged the cotton crop in the suburbs of the city. As a result, the public anticipates that raw cotton will become increasingly scarce and expensive. Combined with low inventories, although factories have no plans to act, holders of goods are quite firm in their intentions. In addition, foreign cotton prices continue to reach new highs, leading to a relatively active Indian cotton trading yesterday among industry participants. The transactions of various firms are listed below:</p>
<p>White Rock Removal: $407.00 for 100 bales, spot transaction</p>
<p>U.S. Peng Japa: $38.00</p>
<p>300 bales</p>
<p>Temit Ling: $760.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Firewood Machine Frame: $310.00 for 150 bales, also</p>
<p>Golan Palace: $339.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>$340.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>$342.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Golan Palace</p>
<p>$330.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>$334.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>$334.50 for 9 bales</p>

<p>Also</p>
<p>$334.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>$334.00 for 100 bales, also</p>
<p>Although trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai remains enthusiastic due to the firm rise in overseas cotton markets and the increase in spot yarn prices in the city, the inability to settle U.S. dollar exchanges is currently limiting transactions, effectively bringing them to a standstill. Apart from small spot cotton transactions, forward transactions are highly anticipated by the public, urgently requiring a solution to the foreign exchange issue to facilitate U.S. cotton purchases by all parties. If this issue is not resolved promptly or without concrete protection measures, it will significantly impact the future of the entire cotton market.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to a government report favoring short sellers, but subsequently rebounded as domestic supplies remained scarce and industry participants and speculators continued to buy. As a result, yesterday's closing prices were up by 25 to 26 points.</p>
<p>A New York dispatch on the same day stated that the U.S. government's second cotton crop report estimates 10,710,000 bales, a decrease of 107,000 bales from August.</p>
<p>The Indian market is quiet with limited trading. Yesterday's closing prices rose slightly by one rupee. The opening market conditions today are expected to be high due to the frequent rises in U.S. cotton, anticipating a rise of three and a half rupees.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>#### Type B Bonds Calculated After Lottery; Other Bonds Show Mixed Performance</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued its struggle, showing little upward momentum. However, buying interest emerged on small dips, making it difficult for prices to fall significantly. While trading volume remained low, prices were relatively stable. The 12th lottery for Type B bonds was held today, drawing a total of 30 winning numbers, one more than the previous draw. As a result, yesterday afternoon's market prices were calculated after deducting the lottery rights, which were valued at approximately $0.60-0.70. In the morning, Type C bonds opened at $71.20, with Yongchang Xinfeng and Lü selling on the market. Runli Lianyi's buying interest was weak, causing Type C bonds to fall below the $1.00 mark. In the afternoon, due to the deduction of rights for Type B bonds, followed by the lottery for Type C bonds, demand for Type C bonds increased. Type C bonds opened up by $0.30, reaching a high of $1.20, with Lianyi Lianhe buying, Runli re-emerging, and Tongkang Runde releasing slightly. The market ultimately showed mixed performance, with Type A and C bonds up $0.02 and $0.05, respectively, and Type E bonds down slightly by $0.05. Type D bonds did not trade at all during the day. Type B bonds, after deducting lottery rights, were down $0.085. The total trading volume was $1.45 million. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of $26.25 per share.</p>
<p>Public industrial stocks continued to be active, while rubber stock trading was relatively scarce. Market conditions at the opening were stable, with prices showing slight fluctuations. The closing trend was upward. Shanghai Woolen opened at $7.30, rising sharply to $7.90. China Textile also rose gradually from $14.40 to $15.10.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Monday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British commercial company stocks remain flat. Only HSBC Bank's UK-registered shares fell by one pound to 77 pounds, with no other changes.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>#### Sugar Trading Active in Both Spot and Futures Markets</p>
<p>Yesterday, buying interest in the sugar market remained strong, continuing to rise. According to the guild's assessment, spot prices for 24/7 coarse white sugar imported in July were $137.20 and $136, up $2.50. June was $137 and $135.40. May was $135.

<h3>Promotion of Vocational Supplementary Education Regulations in Public and Private Factories, Mines, and Farms; Ministry of Education, Together with the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Economy, Promulgate</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail News) In order to improve the living habits of employees, improve production skills, and strengthen production capacity, the Ministry of Education is actively planning to expand vocational supplementary education facilities. Recently, it has jointly consulted with the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Economy to formulate the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Vocational Supplementary Education and Utilizing Equipment to Provide Internship Opportunities for Vocational School Students in Public and Private Factories, Mines, and Farms." It has been jointly announced and implemented, stipulating that public and private factories and farms with 500 or more employees should establish vocational supplementary schools or training classes within one year.

<h3>Suspension of Black Market Exchange Transactions</h3>
<p>- Yugong</p>
<p>Black market exchange transactions, which have been around for the past four or five years, have been painstakingly maintained to meet the needs of 20-30% of the market, at an excessive cost to the country's economy and the people's livelihood. However, the response to this maintenance has created a speculative mentality among the majority of 60-70% of the people. As a result of speculation, prices have soared, and people's livelihood has become more difficult. Yesterday's order from the Stabilization Fund Committee, restricting all foreign banks from engaging in black market foreign exchange trading, can also be said to have been prompted by speculators.</p>
<p>The legitimate foreign exchange needs are strictly reviewed and continue to be supplied, which is both necessary and essential. Here, we hope that the procedures must be taken seriously and the loopholes must be carefully plugged.</p>
<p>International trade cannot exist without the payment of foreign exchange. However, at this time, people should no longer enjoy a rich supply of imported consumer goods. Now, the suspension of black market foreign exchange has been prompted by the lavish spending of consumers of imported goods.</p>
<p>The Shanghai business community should recognize today that this order to suspend black market foreign exchange is both an opportunity to promote the sale of domestic products, not an opportunity to raise prices, and an indication that imported consumer goods should no longer be rampant in the market. With these two inevitable results, our business community should know the direction of their future efforts.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Mr. Wang Fulai - Funeral Service Held on the 7th</h3>
<p>- Chen Hezhang</p>
<p>I learned that I first met the long-admired Mr. Wang Fulai in the fall of 1937 at a board meeting of a company I served.</p>
<p>Last spring, I was writing an article on the Shanghai textile industry and, together with a friend, co-edited the "Wartime Economic History of China," and wanted to consult some economic data. So, one morning, I visited Mr. Wang at the Bank of China. He received me very kindly.</p>
<p>Later, I planned to visit him again, but he was ill. I later learned that he was suffering from accumulated fatigue and was resting at Glough Hospital. Due to my usual worldly constraints, I delayed my visit. A few days later, I suddenly saw an obituary in the newspaper. Mr. Wang had passed away on December 2nd. What a loss!</p>
<p>Mr. Wang devoted his life to the textile industry and made outstanding achievements. His life's work, even in tens of thousands of words, cannot be described in detail. Now, I will give a brief account to inspire people to admire him.</p>
<p>In his early years, Mr. Wang studied on a government scholarship at the Tokyo Higher Technical School in Japan, majoring in textile engineering. After returning to China, he was employed by the Shanghai Hengfeng Textile Factory. Later, he served as the chief engineer and factory manager of the Dachina Yarn Factory, the Wuxi Shenxin No. 3 Factory, and the Shanghai Shenxin No. 2 Factory. Later, he was entrusted to reorganize the Dingxin Yarn Factory managed by the Bank of China. Through his planning, remarkable results were achieved, and his reputation grew daily. He was entrusted by state agencies and official commercial banks. In 1935, he transferred to the Business Audit Department of the Bank of China's General Management Office, presiding over cotton industry investment and promoting the factory affairs of the bank's related factories. The following year, he also served as the deputy general manager of the China Cotton Industry Company. From this point on, Mr. Wang's position became even higher, and his word was decisive in the establishment of new factories or the reform of old factories. Mr. Wang was truly a pioneer in the textile industry, holding the reins of this field.</p>
<p>What is even more commendable is that Mr. Wang has thousands of disciples, and today, the backbone of textile factories across the country has been trained by him. In his spare time, Mr. Wang often wrote articles and published them in newspapers and magazines. His upright and insightful remarks were admired by the world. The country's loss of such a virtuous and capable person is a great loss. But Mr. Wang's spirit will always remain in the world and will last forever.</p>
<p>Finally, I wrote a funeral couplet as a commemoration. The couplet reads: "His legacy lies in the people's livelihood, and his praises spread throughout the world. His great writings are translated, and his academic teachings are transmitted to the East Sea."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>- Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve. Unexpected Storm</p>
<p>"News, I really don't know when the news will come." He closed the door, retreated inside, and sat listlessly.</p>
<p>However, the news did not come as slowly as he had hoped; it was just not good news.</p>
<p>The day after Xiao Gouzi and Chen Da left, the postman sent a express letter written by the headmaster Fang of the county junior high school, informing him that Mei Bao was missing. The last paragraph said:</p>
<p>"...Because Shang's friend Liu is highly suspected, the Public Security Bureau has summoned him three times for questioning, but without result. Your relative, Mr. Zhang, is temporarily staying in our school's gatehouse, searching outside every day with a picture of your daughter, asking around. Although there are still no clues, his kindness is truly appreciated. Perhaps this will lead to information about your daughter's whereabouts, which is not certain..."</p>
<p>Begonia had never believed in gods, Buddhas, or any religion, but after reading this letter, he couldn't help but kneel down to the sky.</p>
<p>"God! Have mercy on us!" He knelt on the brick floor, praying softly. - Of course, he wouldn't start with some "cry" like he did when acting on stage. - "Xiao Gouzi's legs must be broken running; my heart is about to break too. I haven't really done anything terrible, please let my daughter come back safely..."</p>
<p>From that day on, he prayed like this almost every day. But the more he prayed, the more depressing the news became. For a full week, he did not receive any more letters from Headmaster Fang. (207)</p>
<h3>A Sincere Appeal from a Scholarship Recipient</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to my family's poverty, I came to Shanghai after graduating from elementary school and secured a position as an apprentice in a bookstore.</p>
<p>I have been at the bookstore for six years now. However, I am still just a delivery and packing errand boy. Undoubtedly, this is due to the impact of the war; but the main reason is still that I myself lack sufficient knowledge and cannot manage complex and more difficult tasks.</p>
<p>"You regret not studying when the time comes to use what you've learned" is truly a profound saying. Because I lack education, I suffer losses everywhere, so I feel the importance of increasing my knowledge. Last autumn, I enrolled in a preparatory course at Shanghai Baptist College. Thanks to Mr. Zhu's patient guidance, my spirits were high and I became interested in English class. Although I was studying elementary English, it felt like I was about to achieve my goal. This spring, due to pressing circumstances, I was eager to achieve my goal, so without thinking, I blindly skipped a grade. Since then, I tried to be quick but failed, and made no progress. I myself don't know what I've gained in the past six months! During the summer, I dropped out of school due to financial difficulties. Although I am still studying on my own, it feels like darkness is blocking my vision.</p>
<p>Last month, seeing the establishment of the Scholarship Committee's Industry and Commerce Group in your newspaper, it stirred up my will to continue to improve and to seek help. It made me understand the greatness of the spirit of mutual aid among humans, and my future gradually became brighter.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 29th, with feelings of shame and gratitude, I went to your newspaper office in the drizzling rain to get an application form. I dragged my tired legs back, and the next day, carefully had the manager sign and stamp it. Again in the drizzling evening, I submitted the application form with a hopeful heart. A few days later, I received a letter informing me of an interview, which made me feel very gratified and cheerful. It was not easy, but I finally got my turn for an interview.</p>
<p>The editor who interviewed me, although he was so kind and generous, I felt extraordinarily solemn. At that time, after a brief interview, he told me to go back and watch the newspaper every day to see if I was approved or not. Filled with gratitude, I quickly and quietly withdrew. On the way, it felt like I had already been approved, and I felt relaxed and happy all over.</p>
<p>In the list in the Shen Bao on the previous (5th) day, my name was indeed among them. How happy and grateful I am for this benevolent act of providing scholarships. In the afternoon, I received the letter of recommendation for free tuition, and the application procedures were complete. I can now study in peace. Now that I am a person who has received help from the Industry and Commerce Group's scholarship, how grateful am I in my heart for the enthusiastic help from society? I will definitely strive to be invigorated, persevere in my will, and embark on the path of light.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lü Yuanfu (I should be thankful)</p>

<h3>Biographies of Characters in the Raccoon Dog Case</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Ever since novels featured raccoon dogs swapping for pearls, and stage plays depicted raccoon dogs swapping for the prince, it has caused many Shanghai people to be "cat fanatics." The magical power of cats is truly great! Although I have never seen a cat play, I have heard about them and they are familiar to me. Spending long days bored, I am writing "Biographies of Characters in the Raccoon Dog Case" for the annals, based on historical records and supplemented by notes. Although the writing is unremarkable, the effort of research is considerable. Shanghai people only know about the raccoon dog swapping for the prince, but they do not know what it is all about. This work, "Biographies of Characters in the Raccoon Dog Case," is not meddlesome, nor is it making a big deal out of a small thing; it is merely catering to current customs. Calling it the Raccoon Dog Case is following custom. The ancient annals were works that respected the king and repelled the barbarians; today's annals are popular reading materials that respond to the times. Therefore, I have chosen what is seen and heard in common customs, collected widely and verified carefully, to create popular annals. As for the entire contents of the essays, what they are like, today's annals cannot fully reveal. Let us wait for a day when they are published, and then share them with the readers to seek contemporary criticism; it will not be too late. Enough talk, let's get back to the main topic. Readers, please be patient and listen as I tell the story separately.</p>
<p>Emperor Zhenzong of Song</p>
<p>Although Zhenzong is not the protagonist of this case, he is the guiding thread of the case. Empress Liu was his consort, and Emperor Renzong was his son. Zhenzong was the son of Emperor Taizong. Taizong disobeyed his mother and elder brother's wishes, framed his younger brother Tingmei, causing him to die in disgrace, and forced his nephew Dezhao to commit suicide. Zhao Pu also betrayed the crown prince to curry favor. Judging by human ethics, Taizong and Pu were both people who abandoned faith, despised righteousness, were unfriendly, and disloyal. There is no need to say more about extraneous matters. As for Empress Liu, she was not the legitimate consort, and her origin was humble. Zhenzong's legitimate consort was Lady Pan (Pan Mei's eighth daughter. She died before being made empress). He then made Lady Guo empress (Guo Shouwen's second daughter), who gave birth to a son, the Prince Daoxian, who died at the age of nine (in the Xianyue year of Xianping).</p>
<p>The Empress also died in the fourth year of Jingde. Zhenzong had five sons, all of whom died young. Renzong was the youngest and the only one to survive. Zhenzong loved Liu the most, and also feared Liu the most. Many concubines who gave birth to sons were not allowed to raise them, and were even fostered by others (such as Zhang Maoshi, later renamed Zhang Zi in the Song History to avoid the taboo of Emperor Yingzong's name). Therefore, if Renzong was not Liu's son, he would not have been established as heir. Even if he was established, he would not have been trusted. Moreover, Renzong was born seven years after the death of Prince Daoxian. Zhenzong was already forty-three years old, and it was also the third year after the death of Empress Guo. Consort Li was Empress Liu's maidservant, in charge of sleeping arrangements. If Empress Liu had a son, she would probably not let Consort Li be favored by Zhenzong. Then how could there be Renzong? Two years after Renzong (the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, December), Liu was finally made empress. Therefore, Renzong could not do without Liu, and Liu also became more important because of Renzong.</p>

<p>Writing Bitterly</p>
<p>An author was burying his head in writing in his room. His friend, a businessman, came in and asked him, "What are you doing?" The author replied, "I am writing a novel." The businessman said, "You are really silly. You can buy a very presentable novel for only two dollars. Why bother writing it so bitterly?"</p>
<p>Each Has Its Reasons</p>
<p>Wife A: Your dog barks so loudly in the middle of the night that it wakes up my baby and makes him cry uncontrollably!</p>
<p>Wife B: It's not like that. Your baby cries so loudly at night that it frightens my dog, so it barks.</p>
<p>Who Says I'm Impatient?</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang said to Mrs. Zhang, "Your daughter's face really looks like yours." Mrs. Zhang said, "But this child is impatient, just like her father." Mr. Zhang happened to hear this and angrily slammed the table, saying, "Bullshit, who says I'm impatient?"</p>

<p>The Arts</p>
<h3>Zhang Eyun Performs in Tianjin and Jin, Song Dezhu Forms a Troupe to Perform</h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Tianjin, who told me about the local opera scene in great detail. I am recording it here to inform this publication and also for those in Shanghai who are concerned about this art form. The famous female performer Zhang Eyun has been inactive in Shanghai in recent years and has not performed for a long time. There was also a rumor that she would marry a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, which caused a sensation in the opera world and became a topic of conversation. However, it was just an unfounded rumor and has not been confirmed. She has now been invited by the China Grand Theater to perform on stage, starting from the third day of the seventh lunar month. Zhuchen has an excellent reputation in Tianjin and is also her home base. She has not performed on stage for several years. This time, she is making a comeback, and the grand occasion can be expected. Her younger sister, Zhang Yiyun, is not performing for the time being, because there is no suitable role for her. The male actor An Shuyuan and the young male actor Ye Shenglan were her old partners in the Golden Age. The performance period is twenty-eight days, and the following troupe will be the sisters Xu Dongxia and Xu Dongming, who performed at the Carlton in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Song Dezhu, one of the four little famous female performers, lives in seclusion in the old capital and rarely performs. She raises pigeons and birds in her residence and enjoys herself. Since Yan Shishan has been partnering with the Golden Age for a long time, and Mao Shilai is also performing in Qingdao, the martial female performer scene is particularly desolate in the north. Recently, Dezhu was invited by someone and will form a troupe to perform at the Xiatianxian Theater in Tianjin. The male actor is Guan Dayuan, the young male actor is Jiang Shiyu, and the famous Jing actor Hou Xirui will also participate. The lineup can be said to be quite neat. The famous new play "Princess Pingyang Liang Hongyu" will be performed at that time. Looking back at the desolate opera scene in Shanghai, one cannot help but feel envious. But there is one good news to report: Cheng Yanqiu will be going to the Golden Age and will definitely come to Shanghai to perform around the Mid-Autumn Festival. Hearing the sounds of autumn in the season of chrysanthemums, those who have a penchant for Zhou Lang will surely be overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Han Langen Rescues Ge Xin</h3>
<p>— Hua Guang</p>
<p>The drama actor Ge Xin, who is currently a supporting actor in the Tianfeng Drama Society of the Xuan Palace Theater, is twenty-six years old and from Yangzhou. His family lives on Laidu Road, and his landlord is Han Langen. Ge is not yet married. On the evening before last night, around eleven o'clock, Ge, for some unknown reason, suddenly swallowed poisonous liquid at home in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, Han Langen returned home and discovered it, and urgently summoned an ambulance to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was mild and there was no danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Zhou Rongzhi Performs Opera</h3>
<p>The famous amateur actor Rongzhi is the vice president of the Liangyou Friendship Association. He loves Peking Opera and specializes in martial male roles. He is a disciple of the Gai school. His stances are stable, and his singing and recitation are excellent. He can perform plays such as "Baishuitan," "Flower Butterfly," and "Zhaojialou," all of which are his proud masterpieces. He is usually reluctant to perform easily, but he never lags behind in charity performances. He is charitable and generous, and worthy of the name "amateur actor." In the last Golden Age charity performance, he performed "Baishuitan." His baton twirling was skilled and he was extraordinarily heroic, winning thunderous applause. On the 12th, at the Russian Theater on Fuxu Road, a charity performance was held to raise educational funds. He was specially requested to perform "Baishuitan," the finale of the evening show. This veteran will surely give a wonderful performance.</p>

<p>Chapter 16: Taking the Beloved Bird Out of the Cage Early</p>
<p>Seeing Tian Hongyu so anxious, Yuanyuan couldn't help but feel amused. So she smiled slightly and said, "I have an idea." Tian Hongyu was overjoyed, stood up, walked to Yuanyuan, held her soft hand, and said, "Yuanyuan, if you have a solution, why didn't you say so earlier to make this old man happy?" Yuanyuan said, "This is what I just thought of. I don't know if the Master will agree when I say it?" Tian Hongyu said, "Tell me what you think, and then we'll decide." Yuanyuan said, "As the ancients said, when the world is at peace, pay attention to the prime minister; when the world is in danger, pay attention to the generals. Now is the autumn of chaos and danger in the world. Everything depends on military men coming out to quell the chaos and resist foreign enemies, because their subordinates have soldiers and their power is naturally strong. That is why the Emperor relies on General Wu Sangui. After all, civil officials do not have the power to defend themselves. Although the Master has a high rank, a powerful seal, and a rich property, they are all just a source of greed for bandits. If you don't befriend one or two military men to increase your own importance, once disaster strikes, you can neither die nor be captured. Where will you escape to? For the Master's sake, why not take this opportunity to befriend General Wu and win his favor, so that you may have something to rely on in times of emergency." Tian Hongyu nodded and said, "What you say is very true. But this old man has no relationship with General Wu. How can I ingratiate myself with him in order to win his heart?" Yuanyuan said, "The female musicians here are quite famous. I have heard that General Shan has always liked singing and dancing. As long as the Master invites him to listen to the female musicians, he will surely come willingly." Tian Hongyu frowned again and said, "That's right, Wu Sangui is romantic and refined, and has the legacy of Grand Tutor Dang. But the female musicians in my house are not easily shown to others. Suppose he…" Tian Hongyu had not finished speaking when Yuanyuan shook off his hand, turned her back, and said, "Does the Master not agree with this? In the past, Shi Chong of the Jin Dynasty was extremely extravagant. He also had female musicians in his Golden Valley Garden. Because he was very secretive and unwilling to show them to others, he made enemies with people, and in the end, he suffered a fatal disaster. Then, when everything is burned to the ground, will the Master be able to keep the Golden Valley Garden closed? Why can't you be more open-minded?" (164)</p>
<h3>Brief Biographies of People in the Opera World</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Guo Yi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(38) Wang Fengqing</p>
<p>Wang Fengqing first studied martial male roles, then switched to elder male roles. He studied under Wang Guifen. At that time, Guifen was close to death, and Fengqing was still young. He had little direct contact with him, and could not fully grasp the essence of his art. However, the art of Wang is not in danger of being completely lost now, thanks to Fengqing. Moreover, Fengqing was diligent and dedicated, adhering to one school and never changing it to cater to popular tastes. His ambition is commendable. His performances of "Chengdu" and "Zhaoguan," etc., do have something unique, and the style of Wang can still be seen in them. In his prime, Fengqing had a square face and a straight nose. His appearance was excellent and his demeanor was dignified, making him very suitable for imperial hat operas. His voice, foundation, and learning were all sufficient for this, so he was very famous. Mei Lanfang's fame was largely due to his support. That was the glorious situation at the time. However, Fengqing's physique declined greatly. Shortly after he passed middle age, his voice and breath suddenly deteriorated sharply. Although he still had one or two good tunes to listen to when he went on stage, his frowning and painful state was obvious, far from the unrestrained joy of the past. This damaged his reputation and he gradually parted ways with Mei Lanfang. Recently, he has been cramped in Shang Xiaoyun's troupe, barely filling in as a second-rate elder male role, which is also pitiful to see. Fengqing and his elder brother Yaoqing were both extremely talented people of their time. Fengqing is responsible for the continuation of the Wang school, and it is like the "Lingguang Hall of Lu" in ruined walls, while their twilight years have been marked by frustration and hardship, as if from the same mold. What did Heaven mean by first giving the Wang brothers their voices, and then taking them away later?</p>
