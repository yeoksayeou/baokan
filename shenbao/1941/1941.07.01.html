<p>社評</p>
<h3>論廉潔政治</h3>
<p>前代之考覈吏治也，曰清·愼·勤。清者嚴操守，愼者重民命，勤者服公務，蓋集行政·司法·財務於一官，故以三者相勗勉，用為考績所資，黜陟所憑。今則各個分立，民刑詞訟，有司法總其聽，財賦出納，有金庫筦其鑰；行政官吏之事務簡，應可專心於地方利弊之興革，敎育文化之推進，公益慈善之提倡，惠工商，勸農事，興水利，閎交通，造福民眾，斯可謂無愧於勤矣。勤則不怠，不怠，則不暇逸豫宴遊，兀兀從公，民同自為之丕變，此之謂德化。德化，在中國政治體系中最所重視，然必自上而下易，自下而上逆。清陸清獻公為著名之清官，尙為其上提倡理學厲行清廉為事，嘗謂「天下之民所倚以為生者守督撫又視乎部院大臣而行；藩臬之賢否，係於督撫；督撫又視乎部院大臣而行；部院大臣所行果正，則外自督撫而下至於守令，自為良吏矣。」然猶不免為疆吏所蔽，屈沒廉吏，蓋舞文弄法之風，不以今古而有所異。若當貪汚之世，貪汚者有貪汚之實，而可無貪汚之名；廉潔者無貪汚之實，而可蒙貪汚之名；黑白淆亂，有以為不至是，然政治無理性，人情尙私見，是非顛倒，黜陟不公，有所不顧也。</p>
<p>清廉言之更難；蓋必有克已節欲之精神，又必祿俸所入，足以維持其時代之適當之生活，亦必吏治風紀良好，使之不必貪，亦不欲貪，而後廉潔政治之實效可覩。不然，僅有少數束身自愛之士，不欲面紅耳赤，而甘此清廉生活。或則身家富厚，而以居官為立名，有如清初號稱操守為天下第一之張伯行，家道定罪饒，并任所日用之物，亦取諸其家，此之為表清廉固易，然其斥私資，濟公用，亦難能而可貴。大都仍為官僚之積習難除，偽善之心理畢見，故有「分內不取，而巧取別項；本地不取，而取償他省；或使其所欲扶持薦舉之人，幾時報效，而已則掠取清名；或有縱妻子奴僕暗受賄賂，而自命清官；」是為貪其實而清廉其名，另是一種風格。至於力不足以貪汚，行不足以覓不捷徑，而自好無疵者，尙不足以語清廉。惟有力足以貪而不貪，勢可以取而不取，不受幕夜之遺，不為強禦所奪，磨而不磷，湼而不緇，斯眞可謂廉潔政治矣。故廉吏者「亦非一文不取之謂，若纖毫無所資給，則居官日用及家人已不失之為廉。及為環境所迫，有如上官之誅求無饜，層層之剝削不窮，罄其月俸，猶不足供其酬應所費，試問將何以維持其日常生活，意志薄弱者，乃終於同流合汚，此固吏治腐敗之咎也，廉潔政治遂如河清之難俟。」</p>
<p>然而廉政治之養成，非僅由於人的問題，吏治問題，亦有風俗所囿習，經濟條件所牽掣，無一不有其相聯之影響，義理繁博，非本文所許。茲值誡飭吏治，稍申廉潔政治之論，以明其習染所由。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（六五）　英國苦戰中的實况</h3>
<p>這是個重要的辦法，即使不能消滅巨富，也可以使富人數目大爲减少，而加緊平等化。</p>
<p>至於極度的貧困，也已有許多方法，加以减輕。失業人數已减至戰前三分之一以下。戰時工資却亦戰前以上，且一家之中，夫婦同有收入，甚至兒童亦可掙錢。</p>
<p>兵士所得的餉並不甚多，但在衣食住方面，兵士和他們的家族，所得的常遠校戰前爲多。</p>
<p>所以戰爭在經濟上和社會上的變動，已使貧富兩極端更爲接近。其間度日最難的乃是中產階級，允其是低薪的白領階級，即小薪水職員。</p>
<p>富裕和小康之家，雖不免將生活程度，大爲减低，但儘可過得下去。貧苦階級則有政府　切，或以較高工資，吸引他們去做戰時工作，爲間接的援助，或以戰時救濟，作直接援助。</p>
<p>假使他們的房屋被敵機炸毀，必要時可由政府擔任費用，將他們撤退，或加以收容，直至他們有力租屋爲止，而政府也常分擔一部份租屋費用。</p>
<p>白領階級的處境，則較爲悲慘。例如書記等人，因不切需要，即未能增加薪資，反因物價增高而大受打擊。</p>
<p>假使被微入伍，除非幸而獲得委任，他們所得的餉和津貼，與平日的薪水殊不能同日而語，欲以此維持其家庭生活，不免困靴。</p>
<p>假使他們的房屋炸毀，就和貧苦家庭受到同等的待遇，當局先把他們收容於休息所，免費供給膳宿，至他們能移到別處爲止。</p>
<p>白領階級若無親友可投，其痛苦眞是難以言喩。假使他們不得小靠政府的救濟，便須與大多數生活水準較低的貧苦階級同過素小習慣的生活。再則花理論上他們所得房屋被燬的補助金，比例雖然相同，但是中等階級的進軟，大部份用於家庭方面，囚此他們還是感到創鉅痛深的。</p>
<p>所以在平等化之中，也有若干不平等之處。這不啻警告社會不平等和階級制度的取消，自有限度。又况中下階級的心目中，階級覜念並不弱於上等階級，要消滅或是减少這種區別，非經過長久的時間和教育不可。</p>
<p>在政治方面，英國的戰時革命雖小甚顯著，但其涵義却是一樣的重要。英國在政治上顯正趨向左傾。各黨對於議員補缺，選舉，並不競爭，即出同黨黨員充任。但是英國的政治專家，都共同承認全國的輿情確已左傾，且尚在進行之中</p>
<p>這種變動，雖不能在國會中見到，但在內閣中却很明白的反映出來。按照各黨在國會中的實力而論，工黨在政府全部和戰時內閣的小組內閣中所佔席數，已較任何黨派爲多。工黨在邱吉爾革命之下，雖不在實際上佔到政治優勢，却已獲得政治的有力地位了。</p>
<p>但是英國這種左傾，是吾已趨向社會主義化？</p>
<p>不。就是工黨領袖也不相信會有這事。要知道工黨領袖雖有完全屬於馬克思社會主義派的，然而勞動界的選舉人，即使在工業區域內，也極少有選舉工黨以圖推翻資本制度而代以社會主義的。</p>
<p>英國工黨已一再覺到人民不需要馬克思的社會主義。他們所要的是社會改革和較優的工資。因之工黨不得小訓令他們的競選黨員，「愼勿在演說台上講到社會主義，這是沒有好處的。一</p>
<p>工黨領袖所期望而且或者可以得到的，乃是若干主要工業和公用事業，實行某種程度的國家社會主義化。勞工部長貝文，一般人皆認爲是繼承邱吉爾首相最有希望的人，部有他自己的意見。他主張全部礦產，運輸，一般公用事業和信用的國有化，但此必須假以時日，並非朝夕可期。實際可以確定的中間步驟，即由國家對於英格蘭銀行施行更密切的統制。</p>
<p>但這許多僅是計劃而已。英國政治左傾的詳情，決不能絕對的預先推定，我最近詢問勞工運動中最得人心的現任內務及公安部長莫利遜氏，戰後的英國將社會主義化呢？還是國社主義化？他很肯定的答稱，在他看米，兩者都不可能。他說，英國將變爲「眞正自由的民治國。」</p>
<p>記者經過廣泛調查之後，覺得他的結論確有見地，英國各界都在爲自山而戰，並非爲資產階級或無產階級的獨裁而戰。倫敦金融界對於政府財政的操蹤，勢必大爲减輕，或竟全部消滅。</p>
<p>勞工在工業和政治上將有更大的發言權，但結果必仍爲英國式的，民治的，且是傳統的，甚至是保守的。</p>
<p>英國人欲保存過去的精華，自非根據更公平的財產分配而滲人更文明的社會計劃不可</p>
<p>這或許是英國本牌革命最精確的一個定義吧！</p>

<h3>日本海軍力的剖視</h3>
<p>——譯倫敦每日電報——</p>
<p>日本海軍艦隊的噸位，列於世界第三，實力僅次於英美兩國。</p>
<p>一九二二年的華盛頓海軍條約，從日本的心目中看來，顯然是故意使日本繼續處於這種劣勢地位，這個感覺一直留到一九三五—三六年倫敦海軍會議之時。當時日本代表團提出一個複雜的方案，即所謂「共同提高限額」，望文生義，就知道是要求三國艦隊均等。但日本所處特　優勢的軍略地位及沒有遙遠的海外屬地兩點看起來，他在海上的優越性，早已淩駕英美兩國之上了。</p>
<p>日本的提議失敗之後，就退出會議，從此便和「柏林羅馬軸心」沆瀣一起。同時該國政府對於造艦情形和一般海軍建設，諱莫如深，一經涉及，　蒙間諜嫌疑。在此絕對秘密情形之下，要知道該國的新舊艦隻確數，自然很難，但下面所舉的各艦，與眞相相差不遠。</p>
<p>日本現役戰鬥艦共有十艘，其中「金剛」，「榛石」，「霧島」和「比　」四艘是姊妹艦，排水量各二萬九千三百三十噸，於一九一二—一三年間下水。歷年來曾大加革新，「比叙」號雖遵照一九三〇年倫敦海軍條約，改為練習艦，不編入正式艦隊，但一般人相信，該艦現憶恢復舊觀。四艦各裝十四英寸口徑砲八尊，六英寸口徑砲十尊。</p>
<p>「扶桑」和「山城」兩艘，都在一九一三—一四年間下水，「伊勢」和「日向」兩艘，都在一九一六—一七年間下水，四艦排水量與「金剛」號同。前二艘配備十四英寸口徑砲十二尊，五·五英寸口徑砲十六尊。「長門」和「陸奧」兩艘係在一九一九—二〇年間下水，排水量已增至三萬二千七百二十噸，裝十六英寸口徑砲九尊，五·五英寸口徑砲二十尊。</p>
<p>在建造中的戰艦，據一般人觀測，至少有五艘，排水量都在四萬噸以上，砲數與「長門」號同。內中「日新」和「高松」兩艘聞已在一九三九年十一月與一九四〇年四月間分別下水，年內或可編入艦隊。</p>
<p>另有袖珍戰鬬艦三四艘，其中「樫野」號係於一九四〇年一月下水，「八孃」號係於同年四月下水，殆已編入隊伍。傳說中的「角來」號，完成時期更早一年。各艦排水量自一萬一千噸至一萬五千噸，配十二英寸口徑砲六尊，威力甚大。</p>
<p>日本現有航空母艦七艘，最大的「赤城」和「加賀」，排水量各二萬六千刀百噸，係於一九二七—二八年間完成，後來又加革新。每艦配英英寸口徑砲十尊，四·七英寸口徑砲十六尊，可載飛機五十架至六十架。次為「飛龍」，「蒼龍」和「赤龍」三艘，排水量各一萬零五十噸，係於一九三七—四〇年間完成，每艘可載飛機三四十架，配五英寸口徑砲十二尊。最小的「龍驤」號（一五三　年完成），排水量七千一百噸，「鳳翔」號（一九二一年完成），排水量七千四百七十噸，前者備砲與「　龍」等艦同。後者備五·五英寸口徑砲四尊。各載飛機二十架至二十五架、</p>
<p>新近落成的航空母艦至少有兩艘，即「瑞　」和「翔角」，都在一九三九年下水，排水量約在一萬四千噸至二萬噸之間，約可載機四十五架，配備五英寸口徑砲十二尊。</p>
<p>一等巡生民，共有十二艘。其中「愛宕」，「摩耶」，「高雄」，「烏海」，「那知」，「妙高」，「足柄」及「羽黑」八艘，排水量自九千八百五十噸至一萬噸不等，配備八英寸口徑砲十尊。「青葉」，「加古」，「古鷹」及「衣笠」四艘，排水量各七千一百噸，配備八英寸口徑砲六尊。各艦都在一九二五年—三一年間下水。其他巡洋艦如「利根」及「筑摩」（一九三七年—三八年完成），排水量八千五百噸，配備六·一英寸口徑砲十二尊。「最上」，「三隈」，「鈴谷」及「熊野」四艘（一九三四—三六年完成），排水量八千五百噸，配備六·一英寸口徑砲十五尊。「阿武隈」及「名取」經巡洋艦十四艘（一九一九年—二五年完成），排水量五千一百噸至五千一百九十五噸，配備五·五英寸口徑砲七尊。「夕張」號（一九二三年完成），排水量二千八百九十噸，配備五·五英寸口徑砲六尊。「天龍」和「龍田」兩艘（一九一八年完成），配備之砲，僅可發射八十二磅重的砲　，較之其他各國六英寸砲射兵艦，大有遜色。故後來，建造的兵艦，都配備六·一英寸口徑土砲，發射重一百二十磅的砲彈，以增實力。</p>
<p>新造成的巡洋艦，至少有五艘，排水量八千至九千噸。其中「通狩」號已於一九四〇年六月在橫須賀東港下水，「箸立」和「角田」兩艘，大批在一九三九年下水。各艦大約配備六·一英寸口徑砲十二尊。</p>
<p>現役驅逐艦在一百艘以上，排水量自七百七十噸至二千噸，尙有多艘或在建造中，或已完成。驅逐艦都以風雲雪月題名，詩意盎然，如「松風」，「大刀風」，「緒洛」，「峯雲」，「白雪」，「望　」，「無名火」等</p>
<p>潛水艇至少有六七十艘。最新式的潛艇亦已造成五艘，排水量二千一百九十噸，配魚雷管八枚，五　五英寸口徑砲一尊。最小的舊式潛艇，排水量僅六百五址五噸，於一九二三年完成，但不過三艘。</p>
<p>最近落成的海岸防艦兩艘，原是巡洋艦的替身。命名「香島」和「香島」，排水量各五千八百噸，配備五·五英寸口徑砲四尊。每小時速率僅十八海里，但可供載重水雷之用。水雷敷設六艘，排水量自一千一百三十五噸至九千二百四十噸。水雷艇十三艘，自四百四十三噸至七百二十噸。</p>
<p>舊式巡洋艦八艘（一八九九—一九〇二年落成），配備已列為海岸　艦。另有水上飛機運輸艦十一艘（八艘可供商用），潛水艇掃除艦十三艘，掃滅水雷艇十八艘，海岸防艦二艘，內河砲艦九艘及輔助艦，如修理艦，供應艦，油艦及運輸艦等多艘。</p>
<p>日本各報對於艦隊的攻擊力量，誇大過甚，實則艦身都負荷過重。　年以來，日本海軍擬在有限的噸位上，大事作為，已成一種顛撲不破的趨勢。其結果呢，水雷艇「友鶴」號，因裝砲過重，於陰天初次下海時，　告傾覆。費了許多功夫，纔把她救起，已犧牲不少生命。又聞「最上」號級巡洋艦四艘，在試水時，極為不穩，直至大事修改後，始得編入隊伍，仍不能令人愜意。後來的「筑摩」和「利根」號就徹底改變方針，所裝六·一英寸口徑砲，已自十五尊減為十二尊。</p>
<p>至於日本海軍官兵員額，上次統計為一萬零七百名，現已擴充不少了。</p>

<h3>馬萊敎授暢論事實　中國必獲最後勝利　就民氣實力言遠非他國所及　日本疲憊不堪實已無法支持</h3>
<p>本月四日、為美國獨立紀念、本巿英文大美晚報、曾於昨晚發行「民主之光」特刋一冊、以示紀念、該刋對中英美各民主國家、備致贊揚、其中一文、題爲「中國能否獲得勝利、」作者爲國立金陵大學敎授馬萊氏、盛稱中國民氣激昂、其艱苦奮鬥之精神、遠非法比等國所可及、今日本已疲憊不堪、如中國上下若能團結一致、堅持到底、而且滇緬路所得之外援、不虞斷絕、則最後勝利、必屬於中國無疑、茲迻譯其全文於後、</p>
<p>中國民氣甚為激昂</p>
<p>「當警報大作時、成都五十萬市民、方悉危機來臨、乃迅速避赴城外、在林木茂蔭下、伏處達四小時、旋見日機在成都上空出現、於數杪鐘內、投彈數百枚、在炸旣畢、彼等即返至故居、雖聞空襲所造成之慘狀、但對之毫不恐慌、蓋彼等皆以沉毅之精神處之？未及一小時、警報解除、於是叉繼續其工作、此即作戰將達四周年之中國一瞥、中國反抗侵略、却較法·比·等能持久奮鬥、</p>
<p>作戰政策收效甚宏</p>
<p>截止現時、欲謀和平者、爲日本而非中國、因後者堅持須日軍退出中國方有談判餘地、故中華民族精神、深可欽佩、以其人民所潛在之愛國熱忱、實非我人所能想像、如中國能得充份之軍火接濟、及國內能團結一致、必能獲得最後勝利無疑、今中國決心作戰之政策、業已收有宏效、且已露曙光矣、</p>
<p>日本幾難保持體面</p>
<p>就事實言、現時潰退者、非中國而爲日本、日本今已自廣西全省廣東一部及沿長江流域數處撤退、足證華軍實力、已漸加强、日方所恃作反攻之唯一武器、則爲宣傳耳、日方雖諱　日軍之撤退、乃出於「自動」、但設之東京方面宣稱、將派兵進佔荷屬東印度、新加坡、緬甸等地、則此種　言、無非爲維持「體面」而已、可知在華方正規軍及游擊隊之攻擊、日軍已不得不潰退、旣不得不潰退、叉欲保全「體面」、其窘狀可知、日木目前旣未能佔據全中國、叉未能控制全中國、故亦不得不極其所能、以保全其「體面」、</p>
<p>對佔領區無法控制</p>
<p>日方常以「佔據」自命、但迄未成功、例如在日軍嚴密監視下之京滬路、每隔數日、即有火車被炸出軌之事發生、又如某城駐有無數日軍、而華方官員、則仍能照常辦公並徵稅、且解送予中國政府、此即日方所謂佔領區域之一瞥也、目前日軍、同時須對前後實施防禦、猶如一拳擊家、自以爲强大莫敵、無須注意對方之深謀遠慮、實則日軍現時所最感困難者、爲無法控制佔領區域內之游擊隊、其軍隊與武器、殊不知均已於未及作戰前、皆落入游擊隊之手中矣、</p>
<p>華軍實力日見强大</p>
<p>華軍實力、則日見强大、例如華軍云冬曾有奪回山西全省之實力、但因軍事當局、不欲有此一舉、乃作罷論、以爲有如是、方能牽制何方强大兵力、吾人深知該處華方游擊隊實力甚厚、足能消滅日軍及其配備、日軍在佔領區域內、且無法獲得物資、因中國人民、旣拒絕交出、有時且將農產品先行焚毀、以免落入日軍之手、於是日軍不得不向國內內獲得農產品接濟、此實最不輕濟者、</p>
<p>日機空襲得不償失</p>
<p>在戰爭初期、日方每日所需戰費二千五百萬日元、就經濟方面言、日本已無往而不失利、如重慶每决遭空襲、其時間之長久、較之世界各國任何市鎭之遭轟炸爲久、且世界上米有一地、其所受之損失、有及於重　者、然日方所費、却遠勝華方所需用於重建者、重慶防空壕、無異一公共集會之所、因設備安全、人民常在壕中談笑遊戲討論陲眠、一如承平時節、該項工程之建築、其速度之快、遠勝歐洲各國、今日尚在建築中者、如以備置放汽車·汽油、以及其他給養物品、</p>
<p>中國勝利已具因素</p>
<p>中國人民現皆深信日軍最後必遭失敗、爲一毫無疑義之事實、故每人每日幾已不再談及此一問題、中國人民、現皆不避艱苦、爲其祖國不斷從事生產、以給養戰爭、且復由彼等中抽調一部、充正規軍及游擊隊、中國作戰勝利、要言之、實由於彼等沉毅之精神所造成、彼等對於此種日常生活、皆抱有絕大興趣、今美國對日本旣採强硬行動、而中國內部又能團結一致、此皆促成中國最後勝利之因素也、</p>

<h3>紗花　粵銷續旺雜紗狂跳　雙馬照原根結價　金雙馬乃吿抬頭</h3>
<p>紗市仍堅、此因香港幫需要接踵而來、對於雙馬廠單、仍有幾百包交易、總計生意有二千包外、二十三支金鷄大發在跳三十元、至今日須裝出者有二百十五件運香港、一百二十五件運暹羅、所以棉紗基礎甚爲鞏固、同業有一部仍在多頭地位、良以廠單愈抽愈緊之故也、不過市塲言、謂空方已絡續掉期過來、拿出的差金、爲數已鉅、因之有宜傳如果再要在升不已、多方一網扳足、勢必有吃倒賬之日、將來恐怕要取不到錢的、故昨晨開盤、大家都對原根可結價、一律結淸、市盤曾回平、繼後聞粤幫銷塲暢達、空頭紛起扒補、但上日某方由空翻多之大戶、復來吐出、額子的有六千包、售價由一千六百二十元至一千六百元、因之檯面轉鬆、一塲緊張之局面、方告安平過去矣、二十支雙馬最高價爲一千六百二十五元、低價爲一千五百八十五元、午後以七月一日二日均停市、未有成交云、</p>
<p>現貨雙馬晨關、人氣鬆弛、議論紛紜、首盤價為一、千六百零五元、但大戶出來維持賣出、一霎間鬆至一千五百八十五元、在六百元關內往返、爲時甚久、繼聞廣幫買胃甚强、且現紗售價漲二三十元之譜、人心頓振、買氣濃厚、市盤步步上升至一千六百二十五元、惟某大戶盈利了結而賣出、檯面一鬆、即至一千六百元收盤、查半日成交統計一萬一千九百包、內香港幫進一千九百包、同行投機生意一萬包、</p>
<p>金雙馬標紗市况、轉趨上升、此因買戶活動、同時廣幫紗銷約有二千包左右、於是人心振盪、午後漲風頗熾、結果七月期漲二十五元、八月期大漲三十六元、查該所交易、大爲發展、此因現貨軋空太厲、新做停頓、投機遂羣向期貨市塲、全日成交計一萬六千零五十包、比前增八千零五十包、茲將其一日間高低及收盤價如左、</p>

<h3>棉價日高　印棉續到三千件</h3>
<p>現棉情況、依然堅挺如常、美棉雖見回風、然本埠存貨日减、且來源不爽、所以棉商心思一致看昻、棉價可見上升四五元云、</p>
<p>大批印棉經香港轉來、怡和洋行裕生輪、前日（星期日）中午抵滬、除裝來大批洋米及麵粉外、又有印度棉花三千件裝來、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布囤積　重見熾盛　東疋期貨亦猛升</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市續堅、乃因業內外囤風重熾、交易紛繁、售盤忽劇烈上升、白貨粗細布斜紋漲每疋二角半至五角、士林布安安藍布每疋漲一元左右、英商綸昌怡和廠漂布色布亦提漲每疋一元至一元半、木街成交各布五百餘件、廠存各布因下月加統稅關係、有大批轉存堆棧、粤港幫辦藍布·色斜等二百餘件、仰光新加坡等地辦漂布·漂斜·粗布花布等三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　白貨細布因實銷與囤戶繼續搜辦、漲風甚銳、取引所龍頭期貨晨開頭二盤平平、三盤起直綫上騰、結果較上週六市價猛升每疋一元七八角、現貨市塲先跌後漲、交易允旺、龍頭廠棧單最高售開五十元、收盤微挫爲四十九元九角、色貨四君子嗶嘰下午一度升至一元六角四分二厘半、嗣以（一二日）銀行休假停市、散戶獲利撈現賣出、壓小至一元六角三分半收盤、</p>
<p>出口　七月一日有疋頭十二件運厦門、四百九十件運香港、二百七十五件運暹邏、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價續落　港米又到二萬餘包</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况平正、期現兩米均見續低元外、惟前日星期今日爲半年結賬停市、本客辦胃見加、市面尚稱活潑、惟在晨間開盤時、因連日到頭甚湧、而公賣小絞剩餘旣有十多萬包、尚在待沽、而後批貢米及公倉撥入公賣者爲數允鉅、因此人心已虛、兼以月底了結貶脫、故開市後各檔行情立即降小一二元、期路米英華司客囤不貪、市形尤軟、售開小紋現一百四十八元、路一百四十七元半、期一百四十六七元、碎米期貨一百十三四元、繼因現米實消添辦回振、期路英華司亦即跟踵喊高元外、現米跌後本街舖作與內地浙油各幫均趁平吸收、各檔售價立即回漲元外、故結果祇比週六蛟低數角至元許而已、全日成交現米二萬二千包、英華司八百噸、現米開一號西貢一百廿七元半至一百二十四元半、二號一百二十二元至　百二十元、碎米九十七元至九十五元半、三號次碎八十四元、小絞一百二十二元半至一百二十元、敏黨一百三十一元至一百二十六元、砶米一百十二三元、紅米一百零九元、客秈存到兩有、蕪湖機秈祇開一百十五元云、</p>
<p>大批洋米接連到滬、太古公司太原輪、於上星期六傍晚到埠、由香港裝來洋米九千九百九十八包、怡和洋行裕生輪前日（星期日）中午抵滬、亦由香港裝來洋米一萬四千九百七十六包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、二輪裝來之洋米均係工部局之平價米、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米到貨雖仍有限但以本鄉作客見洋米疲頽不振、心思亦懈、銷化不良、市面並難立足、步落元砠、開南港新鮮特別早晚稻百三十七元、大市百三十四元半、無錫原包宿粳高自百三十一元、决至百二十六元、</p>
<p>糯米銷塲、旣已落令、再兼洋米衰落、致巿面愈覺冷落、交易寥寥、售價相隨洋米帶落二元左右、香港白元開高百二十元、普通百十八元半、决百十六元、糯茶百十一元至百零四元、國糯際此庶亦難以維持、開高百二十二三元、中次百二十元、百十八元、</p>
<h3>平賣日內停售　粉巿盤旋</h3>
<p>美粉續到三萬六千餘包</p>
<p>昨日現洋粉市况、續居盤旋、來源方面、被由香港船「太原號　裝到美粉三萬三千八百五十包、其中以五燕脾粉爲大宗、該貨正在起卸、又怡和洋行裕生輪亦由香港裝來麪粉二千四百四十二包、咋亦已起卸、兼値六底比期、米價步鬆、人心不振、惟華廠平賣粉因原料已罄、決於七月二日起停止發售、故本街實銷方面、尚不寂寞、統市售開金龍粉三十二元一角至三十二元、砲台粉三十二元九角、汽船牌三十二元八角、成交的有一寓餘包、市面形勢、尚未脫醞釀之境、小麥供求兩寂、槪無正市、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油豆堅疲不同</h3>
<p>食油　邇又轉趨疲境、蓋以實銷零而不暢、囤戶因恐連油來滬、俱有脫手之意、市勢頗鮮起色、昨售開靑島生油二十桶、價爲一百七十四元、江北本塲生油三百聽、價一百五十八元、大有廠淸油七月上交一百十六元、七月下交一百十七元、比前均見疲落、</p>
<p>黃豆　略巳轉機、貨主態度業漸止吐爲守、是以形勢稍趨堅化、昨由本街辦去天津金元一百五十包、價爲四十七元半、膠州黃豆一百包、價四十四元、靑島黃豆二百包、價四十三元八角、歸德黃豆四十二元三五角、</p>

<h3>銀行準備半年結帳　匯巿淸淡</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌各滙皆平、英美滙暗市頗形穩定、交易殊稀、乃今日起中外銀行爲上半年度結算期、須休假兩天、銀行在小結束期前、供求皆稀也、僅華商投機家仍有八月期空頭拋出、華行少納、市勢故少變化、下午更未聞做開價仍呆定、終僅英滙微緊、美金平、</p>
<p>投機出八月美金</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市印銀略長、美英無市各國滙兌美對英獨跌二五、餘均勿更、中央掛牌各滙仍平、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英滙三便士三一二五、美滙五元四〇六二五、後美滙勢仍呆平、英滙則已還軟至售結三便士二九六八七五、滙豐掛牌各滙仍平、白銀平衡稅仍徵百分之二三·七五、華商投機家塞出予華行八月美金五元四三七五、洋商銀行供求皆稀、午收英金三便士二九六八七五、美金五元四〇六二五、</p>

<h3>結賬休假前　金巿穩定　六月期已了結淸訖</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、重趨穩定、價仍盤於六千四百元內外、兩决退入後、重見回出、各方人心甚穩定、交易轉稀、乃今明兩日爲銀行上半年度結賬休假、須停市兩天之故、自晨開市在證券帮及散戶跟起出籠即低、决見六千三百八十九元低價、不意滬西帮與滙票商忽來套進、立泰傾進允勇、步步盤升至午刻、達六千四百十五元、及聞美輪叉被德方擊沉、止漲始稍回下、下午盤於六千四百〇五元左右、僅十元起落、終軋升五元、全日交易淸稀、的二萬兩、收後價甚平、六月期所餘一千六百〇五條籌碼、昨屆月底、照滙豐小櫃檯美滙五元三七五、計六千四百七十九元一角、多空方了結淸訖、現金價穩、交易極淸、明豐售予天元三十兩、價照期交高三百二十元、下午未聞做開、價仍高三百二十元、比上週六升數元、飾金等仍平云、</p>
<p>期貨僅高五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市爲六千三百九十五元、比上週六午收價低九元、俄爲散戶進、抬上至六千四百元、益大·大豐吐售、漸退至六千三百八十九元、滬西帮來收吸、立見上升、立泰·成記·公大均進、升至六千四百〇四元、大豐·晋元售小至六千三百九十五元、立泰仍進、萬豐·祥興永亦買、午刻提升至六千四百十五元、爲浮戶脫手、重見盤進至六千四百元關口、午收六千四百〇五元、下午二點開市六千四百〇四元、計低一元、恒記來買進、散戶抬上至六千四百十元、證券幫同康明·德孚售出、退至六千四百元、爲公大·公和收吸、常叉提上至午收六千四百〇九元、比上週六午收高五元、照七月美金五元四〇六二五結價、爲六千四百四十二元、計撳三十三元、有二十六元差度、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高三百三十元、收進比售出低七十元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金兌價不更</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍掛六百九十五元、（收進减四十元）云、</p>
<h3>美鈔起伏亦微</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價平穩、英美金鎊因亦無甚上落、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票開盤三角九分、開後志成賣出、退至三角七分、嗣因大公及森記等購進、高至四角一分、午收四角、午後又高至四角三分收盤、比上週計漲七分、現貨較期貨仍須减低二角七八分、香港票趨勢穩定、市價站平、日金票略趨漲勢、晚市高至一元八角六分半、朝鮮票趨勢軟弱、晚市退爲一元五角六分、</p>
<h3>證券　銀行業結賬公債祇做一盤　今明兩日亦休假　衆業股市頗活躍</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市因銀行半年決算、今明兩日休假故公債市塲亦即停市、昨日亦祇做一盤、自七月三日起公債市塲改訂開收時間、上午九點半開盤、十點一刻收盤、下午二點開盤、二點半收盤、此爲天氣炎熱、集會時間、暫時减短、致昨行市初開、仍略高提高、因信孚聯益稍有買進、後以永昌德昌鴻大均有出籠、甫穿出三元之丙種、仍未能立定、復打破三元關、在此多方轉嫁時、暫時故不能抬頭、惟甲種愈覺吃虧、與丙種相差祇七元四角半、愈差愈遠、因抽籤期尚有四十天、必至七月中旬、空方始知難而退也、市價結果、除甲種略好五分外、餘則小一角半二角、丙種無上落、成交的五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交先施公司股五十股、價爲十元　角、</p>
<p>衆業股市活躍竟日、價格穩健上漲、橡皮股趨勢分外堅挺、此因邇來各公司所宜布股息、與人以良好影像故也、</p>
<h3>糖巿　赤白糖齊漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢續緊、赤白糖俱有回好、據荷蘭電訊、荷粗白八月份裝C．I．F．例爲美金三·七五、荷赤七八月份裝船C．I．F．例美金三·一三、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白六月份新貨初爲九十元六角、旋升至八角、更至一元、升六角、五月份入口九十元、四月份入口八十九元、升七角、三月份入口八十八元半、升五角、荷赤亦緊、KD嘜七十一元七角至七十二元、NT嘜六十九元半、升元許、太古車白B嘜西棧一百零六元半、升一角、DY嘜東棧九十六元半至九十七元、HX嘜東棧由八十八元五角、七角、更達八十九元至九元半、升元半、CC嘜車冰一百十元、本廠一號冰一百二十元、晶明冰一百二十元、香港來糖二千六百包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　雜紅杭銷奇旺</h3>
<p>雜路紅棗久無到貨、查市上所存長紅府紅共達三千包之譜、近因杭幫去胃大暢、幾被搜辦一空、以致號存告罄、行盤因之隨緊、如濟南府紅初售四十六元、未及三天、已升至五十二元、長紅亦由三十元、叫至三十八元矣、</p>
<h3>藥材　銀花堅定</h3>
<p>金銀花因產價不鬆、面滙水高昂、來本極難合劃、以致後貨近乏續到、故申市至爲堅定、昨市行盤較高者售五百元、次之四百九十元、不易回鬆、</p>
<h3>石決明回鬆</h3>
<p>石決明即鮑魚壳、近來到存較多、又値去化呆滯、故價見鬆、查號盤曾開過二百餘元、現在行盤、僅售一百九十元之譜、趨勢平軟、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤商倒行逆施　白煤仍在漲價</h3>
<p>同得利白煤、前週新貨到埠後、市氣本可一平、但卒因行家有意關住、拆盤自高、實則炎夏天氣、去銷固甚淸淡也、昨開一二三號塊、自車棧單、每噸四百四十元、較月初又好起二十元行情、倒行逆施、殊出意外也、</p>

<h3>消除種族偏見</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>人類的一大罪惡，就是心胸的狹窄，種族偏見的根深蒂固。歷史上不知有多少殘酷的行爲，是爲了異種的自私與不相容而發生的。</p>
<p>這一類無理的暴行，在極權國仍層出不窮，然而在世界上的其他各地，已經逐漸改觀。這表現人類是眞的在進步着了，最明顯的是在美國。</p>
<p>美國的黑人，本來是爲白種人所輕賤的，可是最近的兩件事實，足以表現黑人地位的逐漸改善。美國費城每年有一筆一萬元的獎金，贈與一年中對社會的進步最有貢獻的公民，今年這筆獎金是贈與著名的黑種女歌唱家安德生的，此舉已引起各方的贊譽。不久以前，羅斯福總統訓令實業界，對於有資格的工人，盡量容納，不得因種族，原來的國籍，宗敎，或膚色關係，而有所岐視。他以爲對於某種工人的繼續歧視，無異是在推行極權國家的政策。</p>
<p>種族偏見不是一朝一夕所能完全消除的，然而任何國家的一部份人士的醒悟，總是一個値得慶賀的可喜現象。</p>
<p>一個更好的世界，應該是像一個和陸的大家庭，每個人的地位是由他對於社會進步的信念與貢獻來決定的，與種族，國籍，宗敎和膚色毫無關係。</p>
<p>動物</p>
<h3>動物的防空</h3>
<p>— 吳福同</p>
<p>英國的動物，也有防空組織，大致是依着人民的防空組織而規劃的。英國共有家畜的一萬萬頭，等於人口的一倍，全國動物空防委員會現已完成一種計劃，包括救援隊，查察隊（入室時炸彈區查察有無被關在內的動物），担架隊，流動急救醫藥隊，和一個暫時的休息中心。</p>
<p>在急救中心看護動物的工作，多山女子擔任，現已招募大批志願的動物守衛隊，充任各中心區和動物主人問的聯絡員。每一條街道上，由委員會儘可能的委派一個動物守衛隊。他們不必在轟炸中進行工作，此一俟警報解除以後，便須立刻在各處尋覓待救的動物。</p>
<p>委員會已成立一種心愛動物的註册制度，每動物，都有個編號的圓牌，經此方法，在轟炸後歸還原主的動物，常以數千計。委員會的組織者史篤特上校說：我們已爲一千只犬和六百只貓尋得了新家庭。因爲這種計劃能使迷途的動物，得回本家，所以也爲警察所尊重。實際上，英國的六百萬頭犬貓，不啻舉行了一次全國檢查。史篤特上校說犬，馬，兎，猴，和鳥類等對於炸彈幾毫無恐怖。</p>
<p>因爲汽油缺乏，各城市街道上的馬，比往年更見得多了。馬主人也忙於增强汽車間的防禦力，以充臨時的動物掩蔽所，公園，棒球塲，足球塲和其他空曠之地，都設有緊急　的繫馬所，在白晝空襲時，可把馬繫在樹上或馬槽鐵圈上，以保安全。依英　法律規定，馬匹都有馬韁，所以一遇警　，可以把馬迅速的繫住。除報引導盲人的狗以外，貓犬都不准入公共的防空壕內。在倫敦的若干公園中，有牠們的特殃設備。甘星敦公園中，設有狗防空壕，每一頭狗用鏈繫在一個分格內，上有水泥建築掩蔽。海德公園中公共防空壕周圍有鐵柵，當主人藏身地下之時，任動物處於其間。</p>
<p>英國的農夫，也受到國家幫助，以保護全國三千七百五十萬頭的家畜和五千六百萬頭的家禽，此項工作，由糧食部和全國農民協會台作。流動的獸醫隊和當地動物管理隊，由一個敎區中的管理員指導一切。最近英倫北部有一封信來說：『在炸彈紛落和機關槍掃射之下，動物却很容易的驅入了安全地帶而一無死傷』。</p>
<p>在空襲之中，有好幾頭狗曾作極有價値的服務，乞姆就是其中傑出的一頭。牠是蘇萊省寳來郡莊脫夫婦所有的十二齡犬。當法倫叵夫人家房屋傾圯，被埋在防禦壕中的時候，乞姆正在近旁。牠竭力用爪爬成一洞，的有法倫叵夫人身子大小，牠又用口啣住夫人的衣服，幫她爬出洞外。牠和一班俠義英雄一般，見人已救出，便不留姓名的掉頭而去，後來追踪到寳來的華脫里夫路，才把牠我着，啞友會嘉其義勇，即以特製的金獎章一枚，贈與此犬。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十　慈父的心</p>
<p>於是秋海棠父女倆便遷到了這靠近山東省的衡水縣來。</p>
<p>「爸爸，咱們在道兒住得很好，爲什麽又要搬到一個生地方去呢？」梅實的心裏却委實不願離開李家莊，臨起身的一天，她還透着很不高興的神氣向她爸爸問。</p>
<p>「孩子，告訴你吧」秋海棠把她抱在自己的膝肩上，用着極低的聲音說：「上個月大伯打家裏回來，告訴我咱們有一個對頭就要我到這裏來了，所以…！你爸爸想凑他沒有來之前躲開去。」</p>
<p>「對頭是男人是女人啊？」梅寳似懂非懂地問。</p>
<p>「是女人。…！不，是男的！」秋海棠含糊着回答。但梅寳的銳利的眼睛，已看見他臉上有兩行淚珠在掛下來了。</p>
<p>「那末咱們就快一些搬走吧！」她不住的點着一顆小腦袋說。心裏禁不住想，爸爸提到這個對頭就害怕得會哭出來，那一定是頂厲害甚至會吃人的對頭了！</p>
<p>其實秋海棠那還有什麽對頭不對頭呢？他怕的是羅湘綺會我來。</p>
<p>「……銀行之事，實在沒法，小人雖已日夜奔跑，無奈大門緊閉，一人不見爲可恨也。袁姓三爺早於上禮拜在熱河兵敗身死，七爺亦下落不明，恐已亡故。此間袁宅人馬星散，亦無一人可以求懇……。」</p>
<p>雖然因爲代筆的人文理欠通，詞句委實很費解，但大概的意思却也不難明白了。</p>
<p>他知道袁寳藩是從不把家眷帶到承德去的，趙四旣然說「袁宅人馬星散，」大概所有的妻妾一定全逃開了；他對於湘綺的可以重獲自由，心裹當然覺得很安慰，並且也未嘗不希望和她團聚，但一想到自己這樣奇醜不堪的容顏，和和跟着銀行的倒閉而引起的經濟上的恐慌，他的心便冷得遠在冰點以下了。（一四六）</p>

<h3>無綫電控制的汽船</h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>美國的海軍，最近發明以一種無綫電控制的汽船，以爲轟炸機練習轟炸的目標。這種汽船長三十四呎，每小時行三十五哩，船中不必有駕駛員，由轟炸機中的無綫電控制，所以在練習轟炸的時候，不　損及人命。此外這種汽船並且是炸不沉的。</p>
<p>將來戰事爆發的時候，這種以無綫電控制的汽船，也許可以裝滿炸藥，向敵軍的軍艦所在地疾駛而去，以代施放魚雷。因爲是以無綫電控制的，所以共準確性當然是比魚雷有把握得多。</p>

<h3>兒童音樂會</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>最近將有一個規模非常偉大的兒童音樂會，要在共舞臺登臺表演了。記者爲了明瞭這大會的內容起見，特向各關係方面刺探消息，茲記詳情如下：</p>
<p>生辦兒童音樂會的是兒童戲劇敎育社。他們在今年的三月二十一日，已經在共舞臺演出過一次，成績很好，有全市數千兒童踴躍參加，得到各界人士的熱烈贊助。此次是第二决的演出了。</p>
<p>演出的日期是七月三日，從上午九點鐘起。票價分一元和六角二種，他們都是向全市各小學校推銷的。據說收入的用途，除了必需的開支以外，完全作爲創設「兒童音樂館」的基金。</p>
<p>演出的節目，有：「暴風雨」，「大地的呼聲」，「保衛大中華」，「新中華進行曲」，「不准通過」等，這都是一些很有意義的正氣之歌。其他還有，渭風音樂館的鋼琴表演，中國救濟婦孺會兒童音樂隊的管樂演奏，最後的一個精彩節目是：五百兒童大合唱，唱「咱們唱起歌」和「我們的歌」這二個歌。</p>
<p>現在正是暑假開始的時候，他們的演出，對於兒童的功課，是絕對沒有甚麼妨碍的。</p>
<p>我們很願意讓一般天眞無邪的兒童，唱出他們自己愛唱的歌，我們也很願意讓一般負有敎育使命的賢明的家長，去聽孩子們正義的歌聲。</p>
<h3>閻世善之十三妹</h3>
<p>— 鹿原學人</p>
<p>演十三妹一劇者，以余玉琴爲嚆矢，繼起者男女角中，實指不勝屆，其較得名者，前有王瑤卿，後有荀慧生，惟自作聰明，披改舊章，易硬蹺爲小蠻靴，其取巧藏拙之處，竊爲識者所不許。昔人曾論及之，蓋玉琴當年演此劇時，特以蹺工見長，徵諸兒女英雄傳悅來店中原文云·「公子（指安驥）速忙退了兩步，扭轉身子，要進房去，不覺得又回頭一看，見他頭上罩着一幅元靑縐紗包頭，兩個角兒，搭在耳邊，兩個角兒一直的蓋在腦後燕尾兒上，身穿一件搭脚面長的佛靑粗布衫兒，一封書兒的袖子不捲，蓋着兩隻手，（據此則現在所演十三妹，始終戴紅風帽，全身穿紅衫褲者，均有所不當，但僅可通融的用在能仁寺上）脚下穿一雙二藍尖頭繡碎花的弓鞋，那大小只好二寸有零，不及三寸。」益信余言不謬，而爲此劇踩蹺鐵板注脚，所以然者，瑤卿對於蹺工，完全不能，慧生能而不精，名曰改良，實則因陋就簡，偷工减料今世善遠追前賢，一仍其舊，力矯王荀，不蹈恒蹊，頗能保持先正典型於萬一。雖爲其處女作，（係初演能仁寺）說唱做表情身段上，未盡能絲絲入扣，頭頭是道，然規模旣具，基礎已立，則此後以獨步之蹺工，時時出演，不難日臻上乘，稱霸歌壇也。余披瀝所見於右，因喜其能匠心獨運，力爭上遊也。再賦詩一首以贈。</p>

<p>中國實騐劇團於二十九晚在夏光中學舉行座談會，出席者除該團中堅份子周一峰，褚羣等外，並有白雲，尤光照，華沙，常言道等影劇人參加擠擠共三十餘人。白雲在席間發表談話：「希望劇人站住崗位，認淸目標，更希望劇團爲大衆所有，而並非私人之財產。」語多勗勉。聞該團日內正在趕排「再生緣」。</p>
<p>華聲演風波亭被禁，原因是劇本未能通過，因內容方面，頗多激昻慷慨。據舒適談：此次損失，估計要在一萬元左右，華聲遭此打擊，此後必將再接再厲，奮發前進。</p>
<p>上海大中學生組織之華夏業餘劇社，準於七月十六日公演曹禺名著「雷雨」。該劇由周芻導演。在「風波亭」飾岳飛之黃河，及呂玉堃等，聞亦加入客串。</p>
<p>魏如晦爲上海劇藝社編寫「牛郞織女傳」，日內即可殺靑。</p>
<p>天風排練「淸宮怨」，爲鄭重起見，特請熟悉淸廷掌故者，臨塲指導，此劇成本浩大，服裝道具，均經設計添製，每一社員，無不傾全力以赴。</p>
<p>「正氣歌」之普及公演，座價一律五角，惟參觀者，只限靑年學生，並須憑各校校微入塲。</p>
<p>去年上海劇藝社暑期公演，是「名劇重演周」，今年已定爲「喜劇節」；第一個節目是「鍍金」與「求婚」，第個節目是「神，鬼，人」，由黃宗江編劇，第三個節目是「邊城故事」，第四個節目是顧仲彝編的「孤島男女」，此劇將請「人之初」、合作者吳仭之導演。</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and Food Minister Xu Kan Hold Inauguration Ceremony; Chairman Lin Presents the Seal, Wu Jingheng Supervises and Delivers a Speech; Guo Tells Reporters Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Peace Terms that Sacrifice Sovereignty Will Never Be Considered</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guo Taiqi, the first Minister of Food, Xu Kan, Permanent Vice Minister, Long Songzhou, Political Vice Minister of Finance, Yu Hongjun, and Acting Permanent Vice Minister, Gu Yiqun, held an inauguration ceremony on the morning of the 30th after the Central Joint Memorial Week. President Chiang, Chairman Lin, and members of the Central Committee all attended. Central Committee member Wu Jingheng supervised the oath-taking. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and after presenting the seals, Committee member Wu gave a speech, stating that in the past, the Founding Father greatly relied on Minister Guo. In recent years, Minister Guo has served abroad, negotiating and working tirelessly. Now that he has been transferred to serve in the central government, his future contributions to diplomacy will be significant. Today, aggressive nations are retreating from the peace-loving and righteous. As Minister Guo said recently, the anti-aggression group will further enhance diplomatic ties, strengthen cooperation, and jointly sanction aggressors. It is believed that warlike aggressors will inevitably collapse. Minister of Food Xu Kan has assisted in managing finances for many years with outstanding achievements. This decision to appoint him as Minister of Food demonstrates the importance the central government places on him. Our country's food supply was originally not a problem, but now there is an abnormal situation of having rice but no food. It is hoped that Minister Xu, after taking office, will continue to address the current food problem with revolutionary spirit. As for the three vice ministers, Pang, Yu, and Gu, whether they have served in the central or local governments, or have specialized in finance and economics, it is believed that they will all use their strengths to serve the party and the country. Chairman Lin then gave a speech, stating that for the past four years, our country's foreign policy has followed President Chiang's instructions, adhering to the principle of responding to changes with constancy. Therefore, no matter how international situations evolve, our country's diplomacy remains independent and autonomous. This is all due to President Chiang's foresight. Today, food must be managed, and the methods must be rigorous, thorough, and appropriate. Military and civilian food supplies must be considered simultaneously, and he hopes that the military and civilians, both in the front and the rear, will celebrate having sufficient clothing and food. Minister Guo then gave a reply, and finally, Minister Xu replied, saying that he would diligently follow the instructions of Committee member Wu and the Chairman, lead his colleagues, be faithful to his duties, and work hard to accomplish his mission. After the speech, the ceremony concluded. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi officially took office at 7:00 AM today. Guo took the oath half an hour before the first air raid alert. Guo will meet with the press tonight. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi announced today that China will not change its foreign policy in the future, and China will never consider any peace terms that sacrifice China's essential rights. Foreign Minister Guo officially took office this morning and will meet with foreign reporters tonight to issue a statement. He said that China's foreign policy will remain unchanged. China has independently resisted aggression and now has an increasing number of good international companions. Guo stated that China wishes to cooperate with all countries related to the Pacific and the Far East. "We believe that China's destiny is related to uniting with these countries to resist aggression." Guo emphasized that China will never consider any peace terms that force China to sacrifice its main rights. China is willing to contribute to the construction of a truly new world order at the end of the war. At that time, China will be willing to cooperate with countries that build this order. Guo also stated that under this new order, free and equal countries can live in a friendly state without terror and desire. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, Wang Chonghui, previously did not formally take up his new post because the newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi had not returned from Europe and America, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had many affairs. Now that Minister Guo has taken office on the morning of the 30th, Secretary-General Wang also went to the Supreme National Defense Council on the 30th to attend to his duties. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi is scheduled to officially take office this morning and will participate in the Executive Yuan meeting for the first time on Tuesday morning. Yesterday, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for Guo, inquiring about the latest international developments and providing detailed instructions on China's foreign policy. The Foreign Minister's official residence has recently been bombed, so Guo is currently staying at the Jialing Apartments. It is said that Guo plans to host press conferences twice a week.

<h3>Multiple Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing in Batches Again Yesterday; Bombing the Western District and the North Bank of the Jialing River</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Forty Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in two batches between 11:00 AM and noon today, concentrating on the western district and the Jiangbei district across the Jialing River. However, this attack was not as tragic as yesterday's. During yesterday's fierce attack, the consulate lane in Chongqing was bombed, and the British Embassy was also bombed. Three British diplomats and the wife of an official were also injured. Bombs exploded near the press association, causing minor damage. The windows of the United Press office were also shattered by fragments. A bomb landed thirty yards from the press association, destroying a house. A woman in the house had just given birth to a son twenty minutes earlier. Both mother and son were safely moved to the air raid shelter of the Propaganda Department, as the woman's husband is an engineer in the Propaganda Department. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - After the Japanese planes fiercely bombed Chongqing yesterday, 54 Japanese planes came in two batches to bomb the western suburbs this afternoon. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>

Two giant bombs hit the British Embassy, killing two people and injuring eleven others who were taking refuge in the embassy's air raid shelter. This attack was one of the most extensive attacks on Chongqing. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>In previous dynasties, the assessment of officials focused on cleanliness, prudence, and diligence. Cleanliness meant strict moral conduct, prudence meant valuing the people's lives, and diligence meant serving public duties. At that time, administrative, judicial, and financial powers were concentrated in one official, so these three virtues were used to encourage and assess performance, serving as the basis for promotion and demotion. Now, these functions are separated. Civil and criminal lawsuits are handled by the judiciary, and financial matters are managed by the treasury. Administrative officials have simpler tasks and should be able to focus on promoting local interests, reforming and innovating, advancing education and culture, promoting public welfare and charity, benefiting industry and commerce, encouraging agriculture, developing water conservancy, and improving transportation, thus benefiting the people. This can be considered worthy of diligence. Diligence prevents negligence, and without negligence, there is no time for leisure and pleasure. Diligent public service transforms the people. This is called moral influence, which is most valued in the Chinese political system. However, it must come from the top down, as it is contrary to human nature to expect it from the bottom up. Qing Luxian Gong, a famous honest official, still relied on his superiors to promote rational learning and strict integrity. He once said, "The people of the world rely on the governors and viceroys for their livelihood, who in turn rely on the ministers and officials of the central government. The virtue of the provincial administrators depends on the governors and viceroys, who in turn rely on the ministers and officials of the central government. If the ministers and officials of the central government act correctly, then from the governors and viceroys down to the local officials, they will naturally become good officials." However, he could not avoid being deceived by powerful officials and suppressed honest officials. The practice of twisting the law is the same in all ages. In a corrupt world, corrupt officials can have the reality of corruption without the name of corruption, while honest officials can have the name of corruption without the reality of corruption. Black and white are confused, and some may think this is not the case, but politics lacks rationality, human feelings favor personal interests, right and wrong are reversed, promotions and demotions are unfair, and no one cares.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is even more difficult to achieve. It requires a spirit of self-discipline and restraint, and the salary must be sufficient to maintain an appropriate standard of living for the time. It also requires good governance and discipline, so that officials do not need to be greedy, nor do they want to be greedy. Only then can the practical effects of clean governance be seen. Otherwise, there will only be a few self-respecting individuals who are unwilling to be ashamed and live a clean life. Or, those who are wealthy use officialdom to establish a name for themselves, like Zhang Boxing in the early Qing Dynasty, who was known for his integrity. His family was wealthy, and he even took daily necessities from his home for his official duties. It is easy to appear clean in this way, but using private funds for public use is also commendable. In general, the ingrained habits of officialdom are difficult to eradicate, and the psychology of hypocrisy is evident. Therefore, there are those who "do not take what is due to them, but cleverly take other things; do not take from the local area, but seek compensation from other provinces; or have those they want to support and recommend repay them later, while they themselves seize a reputation for integrity; or allow their wives and servants to secretly accept bribes, while claiming to be honest officials." This is corruption in reality but cleanliness in name, another style. As for those who lack the power to be corrupt and cannot find shortcuts, they are not worthy of being called clean officials. Only those who have the power to be corrupt but are not corrupt, the opportunity to take but do not take, do not accept gifts in the dark, and are not taken by force, remain uncorrupted and unstained, can truly be called clean officials. Therefore, a clean official "is not one who takes nothing. If one cannot afford the means for daily use as an official or for his family, then there is no cleanliness. When forced by circumstances, such as insatiable demands from superiors and endless layers of exploitation, one's monthly salary is not enough to cover the expenses of social interactions, how can one maintain daily life? Those with weak wills will eventually succumb to corruption. This is the fault of corrupt governance, and clean governance is as difficult to achieve as waiting for the Yellow River to clear."</p>
<p>However, the cultivation of clean governance is not only a matter of individuals and governance, but is also limited by customs and influenced by economic conditions. All these factors are interconnected. The principles are complex and cannot be fully discussed in this article. As we are now focused on admonishing officials, I will briefly discuss the theory of clean governance to clarify its origins.</p>

<h3>Announcement from the Prime Minister's Residence in London: Major Changes in the British Cabinet; Lord Beaverbrook Appointed Minister of Supply; Will Promote Tank Production in the Future</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 30th - Last night, a statement was issued from the Prime Minister's residence, stating that the King had approved the following appointments: Lord Beaverbrook, formerly the Minister of Aircraft Production, was appointed Minister of Supply, remaining a member of the War Cabinet. Duncan, the former Minister of Supply, was appointed Minister of Commerce, also serving as Chairman of the Import Administration. Lyttelton, the former Minister of Commerce, was assigned to special overseas duties. The special arrangements of the former State Minister serving as Vice Chairman of the Defense Supply Committee and arbiter of priority issues were terminated immediately. All these issues will be handled by the Defense Department or the Production Administrator. Now that the War Transport Department has been established, the Secretary of Parliament of the Transport Department, Llewellyn, and the Secretary of Parliament of the Shipping Department, Shakespeare, have both resigned. The King has approved the appointments of Llewellyn and Shakespeare as Secretaries of Parliament of the War Transport Department. Since taking office as Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook has devoted his energy to planning everything, enabling British aircraft production to reach an unprecedented speed and providing the British Air Force with aircraft and new bombs to destroy Germany's operational capabilities. Now, as Minister of Supply, he will definitely promote the production of tanks, artillery, and ammunition in the coming months. The Prime Minister's emphasis on production issues is also evident here.</p>
<h3>Military Exercises Held in London to Prevent Paratrooper Activity</h3>
<p>London, Havas, 29th - A large-scale military exercise was held here this afternoon to prevent paratrooper activity.

Military authorities expressed deep satisfaction with the results of this exercise.</p>
<h3>Italian Troops in Abyssinia Surrender</h3>
<p>Nairobi, Reuters, 30th - According to an official communiqué, the Italian garrison in the Dembi region of Abyssinia has surrendered to British forces. British forces south of Leghanti are making progress despite widespread sabotage.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 30th - An Italian communiqué announced that Italian artillery had heavily damaged British forces in the Tobruk region of North Africa. British aircraft had raided Benghazi and repeatedly attempted to bomb the port of Tripoli, but each attack was repelled by Italian fighter planes. In Abyssinia, British forces attacked Italian positions in the area between Dembi and Turo. Italian forces immediately counterattacked.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Set New Records in Air Battles Last Week; Destroyed 183 Enemy Aircraft from the North Atlantic to the Indian Ocean</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 30th - The British Air Force set a new record for any week this year, destroying 183 enemy fighters in air battles from the North Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The British also lost 65 aircraft, but most of the pilots did not die. If combined with what the Soviets announced, the enemy's losses in one week would be no less than 500 aircraft. In the skies over Britain, the enemy lost 11 aircraft at night, while the British had no losses. In the skies over Germany and occupied territories, German aircraft lost 96, and British aircraft lost 54. In the skies over the Middle East, enemy aircraft lost 73, and British aircraft lost 11. Last night, no enemy aircraft flew over the British coast, while the British Air Force flew over the English Channel twice yesterday. According to a communiqué, based on the results of the British Air Force's offensive actions in the Channel over the past few months, the new Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft are indeed better than the German Messerschmitt Me 109, which they claim to be the world's fastest and highest-flying aircraft. In the future, the British will have even more advanced Typhoon and Tempest aircraft than the Hurricane and Spitfire. Once they are deployed, German fighters will definitely be overshadowed unless they have newer models.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Raids German Territory; Industrial Areas Bombed</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 30th - After British aircraft raided Hamburg and Bremen last night, they bombed Bremen and Wilhelmshaven again this morning. According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, the weather was clear last night with good visibility. British pilots clearly witnessed the explosions of bombs in industrial areas and shipyards, causing large fires, especially in Hamburg. Other targets, such as Bremerhaven, Emden, and Heligoland, were also bombed. Eleven British aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 30th - British bombers raided northwestern Germany last night. A very small number of enemy aircraft flew over Britain last night and dropped bombs in eastern England, but so far there have been no reports of damage. One German aircraft has been shot down.</p>
<p>Cairo, Reuters, 30th - Enemy aircraft attacked Alexandria again last night, but according to announcements, the damage was minimal. The alert was lifted at dawn.</p>

<h3>Full-Scale German-Finnish Offensive Repelled by Heavy Artillery Fire; Lithuanian Red Army Retreats to New Positions; Tank Battle Underway at Lusk; Germany Claims Mechanized Units Have Reached Moscow Highway</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th: The following is the latest war report released here: (1) In the Minsk and Lusk areas, enemy vanguard tank units launched an offensive but have been prevented from advancing by us. Enemy tank units have suffered heavy losses. (2) In the Minsk and Baranovichi areas, enemy infantry is arriving in a steady stream to assist the tank units. Our army is fiercely engaging the enemy. In all these areas, our army, after counter-attacking, has prevented the enemy's main forces from advancing. (3) Large-scale tank warfare is still underway in the Lusk area. Our air force is assisting in the battle, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. (4) On the Soviet-Finnish border, enemy artillery and reconnaissance units are active. Enemy reconnaissance units attempted to break through our lines but were repelled. (5) On the 27th, an enemy submarine was sunk in the Gulf of Riga. On other fronts, our army is firmly holding its positions.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th: The Soviet Information Bureau announced tonight the latest war report, stating: (1) On the 29th, Finnish and German troops launched a full-scale offensive along the line from the Barents Sea to the Gulf of Finland, attempting to break through our lines, but were repelled. Thousands of corpses were left behind during the retreat. Our artillery fire forced the enemy to retreat to their original positions. (2) In the Vilnius and Dvinsk areas, enemy mobile units attempted to attack our flanks and rear, but all failed. (3) At Salakas, Pabrade, and Kaunas (the capital of Lithuania), our army, after fierce fighting, has retreated to new positions. During the counter-attack, our army inflicted heavy casualties and equipment losses on the enemy. (4) In the Minsk area, our land and air forces have prevented the enemy's motorized and mechanized units from advancing. In this area, the enemy's mechanized units' contact with their base has been cut off by our air force's intense bombing, and they are currently in an extremely dangerous position. Our covering forces are fiercely preventing the enemy's motorized and infantry units from advancing along the Lida and Volkovysk line. (6) In the Lusk area, a large-scale mechanized unit battle is underway. In that area, the enemy's tank forces are being reinforced in a steady stream, but their attempts to break through the Novograd-Volynsk and Pytovka lines have already failed. At the same time, due to our air force and tank units' continuous counter-attacks, the enemy's tanks and motorized units have been routed. Prisoners of war claim that the enemy's tank division has been completely annihilated near Lida. Our naval air force is engaging enemy aircraft with extreme effectiveness, continuing to bomb enemy tank units and soldiers, and assisting our infantry in battle. In the Lusk area, our air force's assistance to the infantry in battle is particularly effective.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: Yesterday, from Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and from Minsk to Lusk, a border area occupied by the Soviet Union, heavy fighting continued throughout the day as German and Finnish forces attacked along the entire Finnish border, and the German navy attempted to land at Vyborg (ceded to the Soviet Union after the Soviet-Finnish War) in the Karelian Isthmus. According to a Soviet communique, this landing has been repelled. Today's Soviet communique stated that German tanks that had broken through in Minsk have been cut off and are in an extremely dangerous situation. However, it acknowledged that Soviet forces in Lithuania have withdrawn. In the Lusk area, German forces attempted to break through towards Zhitomir and Novograd-Volynsk in Ukraine, but the Soviet side claims to have defeated the German mechanized units. It is said that yesterday, the Soviet Union shot down 53 German aircraft, while the Soviet air force bravely assisted the army in battle, also losing 21 aircraft. On June 27, a German submarine was sunk in the Gulf of Riga.</p>
<h3>Great Battle Between Soviet and German Forces on 3,000 Square Mile Battlefield</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: According to the latest news received here, large forces from both Germany and the Soviet Union, trained in modern tactics, are fiercely engaged in heavy fighting in Belarus and eastern Poland, deploying large tank units, artillery, and soldiers. The fighting has continued for a full day, with attacks and killings continuing in a war zone spanning approximately 3,000 square miles, from Minsk, the capital of Belarus, in the north, to Lviv, an important city in Poland, in the south. The Soviet side claims that Soviet forces are currently holding their positions. In this fierce battle, armored units, with their motorized units closely following behind, have penetrated deep into enemy lines ahead of the main force of infantry and artillery, resulting in intense fighting behind the armored units. Regarding this point, the German side reported last night that German tanks had crossed Minsk and reached the highway leading to Moscow, 400 miles away. However, the Soviet command claims that the German tank advance towards Minsk has been halted, and that Soviet forces are counter-attacking the main Nazi forces behind the tanks to prevent them from breaking through to meet up between Minsk and Baranovichi, 80 miles to the southwest. Berlin claims that, as a result of German tactics, large Soviet forces have been encircled in this area. Another major battlefield is around the city of Lusk, 250 miles southwest of Minsk (beyond the Pripet Marshes). The Soviet side claims that German tanks around Lusk have also been stopped. The latest Soviet communique states, "The enemy has suffered heavy damage." In the Lviv area in the south, fierce fighting is reported. The German side claims that German forces have captured stronger and newer fortifications west of the city of Lviv and are now advancing towards the city. At the same time, German forces have encircled two Soviet forces in the Bialystok area, far west of Minsk. The Soviet communique states that Soviet forces, after repelling the main German forces, are now advancing to meet up with the mechanized vanguard near Minsk.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 30th: The German News Agency reported that German mechanized units continue to advance deep into Soviet territory, having crossed Minsk and reached Mishko on the Moscow highway. This achievement is the result of outflanking the Soviet forces in Minsk.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: It was announced here this afternoon that, after fierce fighting with enemy forces, German forces have now broken through the Soviet army's resistance in the Rava area, destroying or capturing hundreds of tanks. In addition, 42 outdated 21 cm cannons have fallen into German hands.</p>
<h3>Lviv, a Key City in Southern Poland, Occupied by Germany</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: The German High Command released a war report from the Führer's headquarters stating that Lviv was occupied by German forces this morning. Since 4:20 AM this morning, the German war flag has been flying over the city's citadel. Lviv is an important city in southern Poland.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Responsible sources, in supplementing the German war report, briefly stated that the German High Command has abandoned last week's reserved attitude and released the war report from the Eastern Front. The German Air Force has destroyed over 4,000 enemy aircraft within seven days of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, which is astonishing. In comparison, during the Western Front fighting last summer, only 2,655 enemy aircraft were destroyed in 47 days. The Soviet Air Force, which the world viewed as a threat on the Eastern Front, has had its prestige shaken. Germany has destroyed or captured 2,233 armored vehicles, including 46 heavy tanks weighing 52 tons. The German war report includes three main points: (1) In the Battle of Lviv, elite German and Soviet units engaged, and the Soviet lines have been shaken. (2) Near Bialystok on the upper reaches of the Narew River, German forces annihilated two elite Soviet armies. German armored units have crossed Minsk and reached the highway leading to Moscow. (3) Soviet forces in the Baltic countries are collapsing in disarray, and German forces have reached Daugavpils. The Soviet retreat route has been cut off. The German Air Force has achieved air superiority on the Eastern Front, and German armored units and anti-tank guns have shown their superiority over Soviet forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Lviv, which German forces occupied this morning, is the largest city in Galicia. Before 1918, it belonged to Austria-Hungary. During World War I, the city was occupied by Russian forces in August 1914. It was briefly liberated during the Battle of Lviv from June 17 to June 22, 1915. On November 2, 1918, it was occupied by Ukrainians, and 20 days later it fell into Polish hands. After the dissolution of Poland, it became part of the Soviet Union. Lviv is an important industrial and commercial center, with breweries and sugar factories, and a population of 370,000.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 30th: The High Command issued information today from the Führer's headquarters stating that German forces have occupied Lviv and destroyed more Soviet aircraft yesterday. Last night, 77 Soviet aircraft were destroyed in the Minsk area, and 31 were destroyed in Lviv, including 14 on the ground. Along the entire Eastern Front, 48 Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, and 114 Soviet aircraft parked on the ground were damaged.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Have Intruded into Soviet Territory 324 Times in the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th: The Deputy Director of the Soviet Information Bureau, Lozovsky, received reporters for the first time on June 28 and delivered a speech stating: "As you all know, the Soviet Union has now become the target of provocative aggression by German fascism. The German side is relying on fabrications and lies to cover up its illegal attacks. Hitler's declaration of war against the Soviet Union is 100% self-deception. The Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, refuted the lies spread by Hitler and the German Foreign Minister in his radio address on June 22. However, because there are too many rumors, it is impossible to refute them one by one. Although lies can poison the atmosphere, for the sake of public health, we must rebut them at any time. Regarding the nonsensical remarks fabricated by these gentlemen, I will give three examples as proof: (1) Hitler insisted in his declaration that Soviet pilots had violated German airspace, intending to show that they considered themselves masters of German territory. However, the facts prove otherwise. From January 1, 1941, to June 22, German aircraft violated the Soviet border 324 times. Soviet aircraft only accidentally violated German airspace eight times. In January and March 1941, the Soviet Union sent notes to the German side, pointing out the facts of German aircraft violating the border. Later, the number of border violations increased daily. Soviet officials sent a note to the German ambassador to the Soviet Union on April 21, stating that German aircraft had violated the border a total of 80 times during the period from March 27 to April 21. However, this kind of communication was still ineffective. On June 21, the Soviet Council of People's Commissars sent another note to the German ambassador, pointing out that German aircraft had violated the border 180 times during the period from April 19 to June 19. Several times, German aircraft penetrated deep into Soviet territory to a depth of 100 to 150 kilometers. The purpose of these aircraft violations was to conduct reconnaissance of Soviet territory, and certainly not due to German pilots getting lost. From this point of view, all of Hitler's claims are distortions of the facts. (2) The German Foreign Minister claimed in his memorandum of June 23 that the Soviet Union had incited Turkey against Germany in March 1941 and provided Turkey with various assurances. Although this statement is extremely cunning, it lacks common sense. The Soviet Union had declared that if Turkey were attacked, the Soviet Union would remain neutral. Currently, Germany is at war with the Soviet Union, and several countries, such as Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and even the United States, are strictly maintaining neutrality. From the German point of view, all those who declare neutrality are taking a hostile attitude towards Germany. (3) Regarding the issue of the straits, we do not know Hitler's knowledge of music, but in his declaration, Hitler sang a high-pitched tune, claiming that Molotov had talked to him about ceding the straits when he was in Berlin. Regarding this point, the Soviet government has stated that it is absolutely not in accordance with the facts. This kind of rumor is nothing more than a way to deceive people who do not understand the Soviet Union's basic policies. At the same time, Britain is attempting to incite Turkey against the Soviet Union and arouse the antipathy of the Turkish people."</p>
<h3>Soviet and German Exchange of Diplomatic Personnel; Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th: After the Deputy Director of the Soviet Information Bureau received foreign journalists for the first time yesterday and delivered a speech, he also answered questions from the journalists. One journalist asked: "When the whole world understands that the German side is preparing for war, why is the Soviet TASS still saying that the German side is abiding by its commitments?" He replied: "Judging from the recent facts, the Soviet government's policy is extremely clear. The Soviet government is doing everything in its power to maintain the German-Soviet commitments. The purpose of TASS's statement is to force the German side to state whether it is abiding by the treaty. TASS's statement was not published in the newspapers of Germany and its slave countries, which shows that Germany is not prepared to abide by the treaty. The treacherous behavior of the German side proves that the German government is arbitrarily 'revising' international law. The purpose of signing non-aggression pacts is also to prepare to launch a sudden attack on the signatory country." Later, the journalist asked him to describe the actual war situation in detail. Regarding this point, he replied: "As you all know, the German side is using false information to confuse the international community. This kind of information is purely fabricated from beginning to end. You must also know this. We do not want to invent information. We want to report the facts to the people of the world. Our information may be slightly delayed, but this is because we must verify it before publishing it." Regarding the fate of the personnel of the Soviet embassy in Germany and the German embassy in the Soviet Union, he said: "Negotiations for the exchange of diplomatic personnel are underway. The people responsible for this negotiation are the Bulgarian legation in Moscow (representing the German side) and the Swedish legation in Berlin (representing the Soviet Union)." Then, after discussing the publication of the war report of the Soviet Information Bureau with the journalists, the meeting ended successfully.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on the European War (65): The Reality of Britain's Hard Fighting</h3>
<p>This is an important method, which, even if it cannot eliminate the extremely wealthy, can greatly reduce the number of wealthy people and intensify equalization.</p>
<p>As for extreme poverty, there are already many methods to alleviate it. The number of unemployed people has been reduced to less than one-third of what it was before the war. Wartime wages are also higher than before the war, and both husband and wife in a family have income, and even children can earn money.</p>
<p>Soldiers' pay is not very high, but in terms of clothing, food, and housing, soldiers and their families often receive far more than before the war.</p>
<p>Therefore, the economic and social changes of the war have brought the two extremes of wealth and poverty closer together. The people who have the most difficult time are the middle class, especially the low-paid white-collar class, that is, the small-salary employees.</p>
<p>Wealthy and well-off families, although they inevitably have to greatly reduce their living standards, can still get by. The poor have government assistance, either attracting them to do wartime work with higher wages as indirect assistance, or providing direct assistance through wartime relief.</p>
<p>If their houses are destroyed by enemy aircraft, the government will bear the cost of evacuating or sheltering them if necessary, until they have the means to rent a house, and the government often shares part of the rent.</p>
<p>The situation of the white-collar class is more miserable. For example, clerks and others, because they are not essential, have not had their salaries increased, but have been greatly affected by rising prices.</p>
<p>If they are drafted into the army, unless they are fortunate enough to be commissioned, the pay and allowances they receive are not comparable to their usual salaries, and they will inevitably be in trouble trying to maintain their family life with this.</p>
<p>If their houses are destroyed, they receive the same treatment as poor families. The authorities first shelter them in rest centers and provide them with free meals and accommodation until they can move elsewhere.</p>
<p>If the white-collar class has no relatives or friends to turn to, their suffering is truly indescribable. If they do not have to rely on government relief, they must live the same simple life as most of the poor, whose living standards are lower. Furthermore, although the subsidies they receive for destroyed houses are theoretically the same, a large part of the middle class's income is used for family expenses, so they still feel deeply hurt.</p>
<p>Therefore, in equalization, there are also some inequalities. This is nothing more than a warning that the abolition of social inequality and the class system is limited. Moreover, in the minds of the lower-middle class, the concept of class is no weaker than that of the upper class. It will take a long time and education to eliminate or reduce this distinction.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, although Britain's wartime revolution is not very obvious, its meaning is just as important. Britain is clearly moving towards left-leaning politics. The parties do not compete for by-elections of parliamentarians, but rather send members of the same party to fill the vacancies. However, British political experts all agree that national public opinion has indeed moved to the left and is still in progress.</p>
<p>This change, although not seen in Parliament, is clearly reflected in the Cabinet. According to the strength of each party in Parliament, the Labor Party occupies more seats in the entire government and the War Cabinet's small Cabinet than any other party. Under Churchill's revolution, although the Labor Party did not actually gain political dominance, it has gained a powerful political position.</p>
<p>But is this leftward shift in Britain moving towards socialization?</p>
<p>No. Even Labor Party leaders do not believe this will happen. It should be understood that although there are Labor Party leaders who belong entirely to the Marxist socialist school, there are very few voters in the labor sector, even in industrial areas, who elect the Labor Party in order to overthrow the capitalist system and replace it with socialism.</p>
<p>The British Labor Party has repeatedly realized that the people do not need Marx's socialism. What they want is social reform and better wages. Therefore, the Labor Party must instruct their campaigning members, "Be careful not to talk about socialism on the podium, it is of no use."</p>
<p>What Labor Party leaders expect and perhaps can achieve is the implementation of some degree of state socialism in several key industries and public utilities. The Minister of Labor, Bevin, who is generally considered to be the most promising successor to Prime Minister Churchill, has his own opinions. He advocates the nationalization of all minerals, transportation, general public utilities, and credit, but this must take time and cannot be achieved overnight. The actual intermediate step that can be determined is for the state to exercise closer control over the Bank of England.</p>
<p>But these are just plans. The details of Britain's political leftward shift cannot be absolutely predicted in advance. I recently asked Morrison, the current Minister of Home Affairs and Public Security, the most popular in the labor movement, whether Britain after the war will be socialist or national socialist? He replied very definitely that in his opinion, neither is possible. He said that Britain will become a "truly free democratic country."</p>
<p>After extensive investigation, the reporter feels that his conclusion is insightful. All sectors in Britain are fighting for freedom, not for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. The financial community in London's control over government finances will inevitably be greatly reduced, or even completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Labor will have a greater say in industry and politics, but the result will still be British-style, democratic, traditional, and even conservative.</p>
<p>The British want to preserve the essence of the past, and they must integrate it into a more civilized social plan based on a more equitable distribution of property.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the most accurate definition of the British revolution!</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Announces One Week of War News; Germany Fails to Achieve Blitzkrieg Victory; Frontline Communications Cut Off</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th: Hitler and his supporters, because they have never encountered difficulties in this imperialist war, recently claimed again in a radio broadcast that they had captured and destroyed 2,000 Soviet tanks, 600 cannons, and 4,000 aircraft in seven days, and captured 40,000 Red Army soldiers. During the same period, the German side only lost 150 aircraft, and said nothing about losses of tanks, cannons, etc. This kind of boastful rumor is not worth laughing at. The actual situation is very different from what Hitler claimed. The German side concentrated 170 divisions on the Soviet border, of which at least one-third were tank and motorized divisions. The German side took advantage of the fact that the Soviet army had not reached the border and started the war without authorization, attacking our border by theft. During the first day of fighting, our army lacked both tanks and cannons. The war progressed into the second day, and only our forward infantry units participated. On the third and fourth days, our regular army only made contact with the enemy in certain locations. Due to this situation, the enemy was able to continuously occupy Bialystok, Grodno, Brest, Vilnius, and Kaunas. The German side originally intended to block the deployment of our army within a few days, and to occupy Kyiv and Smolensk within a week using blitzkrieg tactics. However, the facts prove that the enemy did not achieve its goal. Our army is still deploying smoothly, and the so-called blitzkrieg attacks on Kyiv and Smolensk have also been thwarted. After seven or eight days of fierce resistance from our army, the German side lost 2,500 tanks and 1,500 aircraft, and 30,000 German officers and soldiers were captured. During the same period, the Soviet side lost 850 aircraft and 900 tanks, and 15,000 people were missing or captured. This is the actual situation on the front lines, which can refute the inaccuracy of German radio propaganda. Judging from the war situation in the past eight days, we can reach the following conclusions: the blitzkrieg victory expected by the German command has failed, the German frontline communications have been cut off, and the German offensive spirit has been frustrated. On the other hand, although the deployment of Soviet troops was slightly delayed, they were still able to defend Soviet territory, inflict heavy damage on the enemy, and exhaust them.</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Personnel Fight Heroically</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 30th: A Soviet communique stated that the air force personnel led by Comrade Rodakov are now heroically resisting the enemy. In total, the German aircraft shot down in air combat in the past three days have reached 13 bombers and fighter planes. Also, the squadron led by Comrade Karabinitz shot down five German aircraft in a certain air battle without suffering any losses to its own squadron. At dawn, our reconnaissance aircraft discovered German tank units advancing rapidly in a certain village. After receiving the report, the commander ordered his subordinates to cut off the German tanks' communications. Soviet bomber squadrons also set out to engage the enemy. As a result of this battle, our aircraft and tanks were superior, and the German army was defeated and retreated. A total of 15 German tanks were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Vichy Government Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union; Diplomats to Return Home; Albania Declares War on Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuter, Vichy, 30th. The French government has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union this morning. French Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Darlan has delivered the notification to the Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov. The French government subsequently issued the following official gazette: "The French government has determined that Soviet diplomatic and consular officials have engaged in activities detrimental to order and security in France. Therefore, it has decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The government has now instructed the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union to notify the Soviet government of this decision." Soviet diplomatic officials in France and French diplomatic officials in the Soviet Union are now preparing to return to their respective countries.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Tirana, 30th. Officials here announced yesterday that Albania has declared war on the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Paratroopers Land in Finland and Romania</h3>
<p>Havas, Finnish Capital, 29th. A local radio station has just announced that Soviet paratroopers have reportedly landed behind Finnish military positions. All citizens are required to cooperate in defense and report any suspicious individuals to the authorities immediately.</p>
<p>Havas, Romanian Capital, 29th. The German-Romanian Joint Command announced in its war report that fierce fighting continues unabated from the Bukovina region to the Black Sea coast.

<h3>Britain Expresses Determination to Cooperate with the Soviet Union; U.S. Ambassador Visits Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 30th. Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, carries a special letter from the British government to the Soviet government on his return. After introducing members of the British military and economic delegations to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the British Ambassador declared to Molotov that he was instructed by the British government to convey its sincere desire to assist in the victory of the Soviet army and its determination to fully cooperate in the common struggle.</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 30th. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday for approximately one hour.</p>
<h3>Pope Delivers Radio Address</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Vatican City, 30th. Pope Pius XII delivered his most pessimistic address since the outbreak of war via radio to the world yesterday. The day was the commemoration of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul. Unexpectedly, the Pope did not mention any hope for peace. The Vatican believes that he is preparing to cope with the long-term suffering of the war. Church officials generally believe that this speech, ostensibly the most pastoral broadcast by any Pope on the radio, in reality contains political implications and possible interpretations. His reference to the "ascension of atheism" is widely understood to refer to the heresy of the Soviet Union. Most Vatican observers believe that the speech contains criticism of world leaders, stating, "All mankind is as children before God. Even the most experienced leaders can only judge things with shortsighted eyes. God observes things with the unchanging center of the universe, while the leaders of various countries only have a limited perspective of a few years. God has the far-sighted perspective of generations."</p>
<h3>German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Discusses Objectives of War Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 30th. A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry stated frankly today that Germany's war with the Soviet Union aims to overthrow Bolshevism, not to restore Imperial Russia. Therefore, the wishful thinking of anti-Soviet White Russians has been shattered. When asked if Germany would allow White Russians the opportunity to organize legions to help Germany attack the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, the spokesperson replied that Germany fears it cannot allow the organization of a White Russian army. Aside from the issue of Germany attacking the Soviet Union, organizing a White Russian army is also very difficult.</p>
<h3>Turkish President Returns to Capital; To Receive French Representative; Implementation of Pre-War Treaties; Menemencioglu Continues Discussions with Turkish Authorities</h3>
<p>Reuter, Ankara, 30th. The Turkish President returned here today and is expected to receive Vichy Minister Menemencioglu. At that time, Menemencioglu will present the letter he carries from Pétain to the Turkish President. Turkish protocols stipulate that all official actions must take place in the Turkish capital. Therefore, the Turkish President did not receive Menemencioglu during his stay for several days at his summer residence in Yalova. Yesterday, a French spokesperson stated that Menemencioglu was in Ankara to discuss the withdrawal of Vichy troops from Syria. It is rumored that Menemencioglu's trip is to consult with Turkey on allowing weapons to transit through Turkey into Syria. The general public believes that Menemencioglu's efforts in this regard will not succeed. The former German Consul in Beirut, Rosse, and several staff members have arrived here, showing that Germany has not abandoned its concerns about Syria. German sources say that since the collapse of France, Rosse has been actively engaged in anti-British propaganda among Arabs and Syrians. Berlin Radio announced today that further news will be released regarding the activities of the Arab guerrilla leader, Sakhut Zogi, in the disturbances in Palestine. Local people believe that Sakhut Zogi may be related to the Arab mercenary corps currently being recruited by General Dentz.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 29th. Cabinet Deputy Menemencioglu continued talks with Turkish authorities today. However, responsible parties have not disclosed what was discussed. Diplomatic observers believe that Menemencioglu's trip is to discuss the implementation of various treaties signed between France and Turkey before the war with Turkish authorities.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 30th. The Independent French News Agency reports from Istanbul that four Vichy diplomats stationed in Turkey have resigned within a week, including Smaila, the counselor of the embassy, and the secretary and agent of the consulate general. This has disrupted Vichy's diplomatic affairs in Turkey. Furthermore, the number of French colonies leaning towards the Free French movement is increasing daily. It is feared that more officials will resign in the future. This is also the reason why Vichy Minister Menemencioglu is visiting Turkey.</p>
<p>Havas, Ankara, 29th. Officials stated that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu will not personally go to Berlin to participate in the ceremony for the exchange of ratification documents for the German-Turkish friendship treaty. Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sigi Jia, has departed for Berlin to represent Turkey in this matter.</p>
<p>English Ships Continue to be Sunk in North Atlantic</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 30th. It was announced here today that German submarines recently sank five British ships in the North Atlantic, totaling 25,400 tons, including one British auxiliary cruiser. In total, German submarines have recently sunk 96,100 tons of British ships in the North Atlantic.</p>
<h3>Turkey Hastens Construction of Two Railways to Iran and Iraq</h3>
<p>Havas, Istanbul, 29th. The Turkish government has recently decided to speed up the construction of two railways, one to Iran and one to Iraq.</p>
<p>Havas, Ankara, 29th. The semi-official "Anatolia" news agency has issued a message stating that rumors that British Foreign Secretary Eden will meet with the Turkish Ambassador to inform him that Britain is deeply concerned about Turkey's permission for German troops to transit, and that Turkey is about to abandon its neutral policy, are all denied by the local government.</p>
<h3>Extensive Scope of British-Spanish Talks</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 30th. Reuters diplomatic correspondent heard from responsible sources in London that the British Ambassador to Madrid, Hoare, had lengthy talks with Franco on Saturday and Sunday. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer was also present. The scope of the discussions was quite broad. The riots near the British Embassy were also among the topics discussed. Franco expressed sympathy to the British Ambassador regarding the riots and assured him that the Spanish government strongly disapproved of the riots, was determined to punish the rioters, and would take all necessary steps to prevent future riots.</p>

<h3>Owen Lattimore En Route to China Praises Chinese and American Leaders; Says Chiang is Symbol of Chinese Unity; Roosevelt Has Become Sole Leader of America</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 30th. Owen Lattimore, the newly appointed political advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, said yesterday that China and the United States are fortunate to have Generalissimo Chiang and President Roosevelt as leaders. He said that Generalissimo Chiang is a symbol of all Chinese and of Chinese unity, and President Roosevelt is a symbol of American leadership. He believes that President Roosevelt's recommendation to assist Generalissimo Chiang is a symbol of equality in the ideals pursued by China and the United States. This move also represents a great increase in the confidence of the people of China and the United States in the shared interests of the two countries. In four years of war, China is fighting to protect its ideals, and the United States has felt the need to increase its aid to China. Lattimore has lived in China for many years and is fluent in several Chinese dialects. He said that China represents the vanguard of various ideals, which are respected and defended by the American people. Lattimore is scheduled to leave San Francisco on July 8, taking a clipper via Hong Kong to Chongqing. His wife and ten-year-old child will remain in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th, Special Dispatch. People here believe that Lattimore's appointment as political advisor to China's Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is very important. It is widely believed that cooperation between the relevant governments and the Chinese government will be further expressed, and Lattimore's appointment as Chiang's advisor was recommended by President Roosevelt, and is the first person Roosevelt has recommended to Chiang, so all parties attach particular importance to this matter. In the past, Germany and Italy both sent advisors to serve under the Chinese government. Now the United States is doing the same, showing the depth of American concern for China's war of resistance. Today, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Lattimore to ask about his feelings. He said that he personally felt very honored for this position, and he was especially pleased to be able to serve beside China's wise leader. Lattimore lived in China for twelve years in his childhood, and between 1919 and 1937, he still traveled frequently between China and the United States. When he goes to China, he not only does not feel like he is leaving the country, but also feels like he is returning home, which shows the depth of his goodwill towards China. Lattimore continued to tell reporters that he was very excited to be able to personally participate in China's war of resistance this time. Lattimore speaks fluent Chinese, with a strong Beijing accent. He said the word (war) in pure Chinese, so Lattimore can talk to Generalissimo Chiang in person without a translator after he comes to China. Lattimore is known in the United States for being pro-China. During his stay in China, he specialized in writing about China, including Mongolia, Manchuria, Xinjiang, etc. Therefore, he knows very few people among the Nationalist government, and he and his wife have never met Generalissimo Chiang. Several weeks ago, Lattimore visited President Roosevelt several times, which must have been related to this matter. At the last meeting between Lattimore and Roosevelt last week, Currie, Roosevelt's representative to Chongqing, was also present. When Lattimore mentioned Sino-American relations, he said that China and the United States are fortunate to have President Roosevelt and Generalissimo Chiang, the two greatest leaders in the world, at this critical time. There is no third person in other parts of the world. Roosevelt is the symbol of American leadership, while Generalissimo Chiang is the symbol of the unity of all Chinese and all parts of China. Lattimore believes that his appointment as Generalissimo Chiang's political advisor shows that China and the United States have the same views, which is what the two peoples and their leaders are striving for, and shows that the people of China and the United States have more and more recognized that the interests of the two countries are the same. He said that China has been fighting a bloody war for four years to defend its ideals, and the United States is gradually recognizing the importance of helping China. China is in the vanguard of the ideals that the United States loves, needs, and defends. Although the world's attention is now mostly focused on Europe, the United States' aid to China is not less than its aid to Britain. The importance of China's war is the same as that of Britain's war, and he hopes for close understanding and cooperation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 30th. The press and government authorities here have not yet commented on U.S. President Roosevelt's recommendation of Far East expert Owen Lattimore as political advisor to the Chinese Nationalist government. The newspapers only published this news in an unimportant position with a few lines of text. However, judging from their tone in commenting on the German-Soviet war, the newspapers all believe that the United States and Britain will take the opportunity to intensify their pressure on Japan. Their only hope lies in Germany's rapid defeat of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Former U.S. President Hoover Delivers Speech Advocating Aid to China and Britain But Says U.S. Must Not Participate in War</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 30th. Former President Hoover delivered a radio address in Chicago last night, clarifying a plan to maintain peace in the Americas. The main points are as follows: 1. Do our best to assist China and Britain, but do not send troops to the war zones. 2. Strengthen military preparations to defend the Western Hemisphere, but do not provoke others. 3. The responsibility for war and peace should be borne entirely by the Senate and the House of Representatives. 4. Abandon the concept of ideological war, such as forcing other countries to accept "four freedoms." 5. Call on other countries to follow the United States and share freedom. 6. Use endless resources as a backing to promote a just and lasting peace, so that all exhausted countries can listen. 7. Change the idea of opposing peace conferences. In addition, the United States should fulfill its promise to assist the Soviet Union, but it is wrong to participate in the war because of this.</p>
<h3>U.S. Communist Party Advocates Aid to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuter, New York, 30th. The National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party recently issued a declaration advocating full aid to Britain, the Soviet Union, and all those who are hostile to Hitler. At the same time, the democratic freedoms and economic standards enjoyed by the American people must be maintained and expanded. Aiding China and not funding Japan is also included in the committee's anti-Hitler action program. According to a Washington dispatch from New York, some influential military strategists advocate consulting with the Soviet Union to give American aircraft the convenience of using Soviet air bases in Siberia opposite Alaska, which can be arranged in the same way as with Britain.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports Germany Hopes Japan Will Wage War Against Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 30th.

The German side is now quietly waiting to see what concrete actions Japan will take. The Nazi Party believes that Bolshevism is the "common enemy of mankind" and that Japan will be willing to cooperate in eliminating it. Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima said that Japan should temporarily adopt an extremely cautious attitude and closely study the German situation.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Signs Order to Induct New Recruits; Number Will Reach 900,000; Authorizes Secretary of War to Implement Starting in July</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Hyde Park, 30th. President Roosevelt, in order to "national interests," signed an executive order yesterday ordering that 900,000 newly drafted men be allocated to the U.S. Army this year starting on July 1 to replace the enlisted personnel whose terms of service will expire this autumn. The order authorizes Secretary of War Stimson to call up the new troops within twelve months starting on July 1 if necessary. The order indicates that the trained men can be replaced after a one-year term, but Chief of Staff Marshall has announced that the term of service for trainees may exceed one year. Extending the term of service beyond twelve months will require the approval of Congress.</p>
<h3>Filipinos in America Pledge Allegiance to United States</h3>

It is also said that one American is missing and the rest were rescued. The Navy Department announced on Saturday and Sunday that three Marine officers and 60 soldiers had set off for London because the work of the U.S. Embassy in London had greatly increased, and an office was added, so the Marines were sent to be responsible for traffic between the offices and fire prevention, to reduce the burden on the embassy staff.</p>
<h3>Paderewski Dies in America; Master Pianist and Polish Statesman</h3>
<p>Reuter, New York, 30th. Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the first Prime Minister of the Polish Republic and one of the most famous pianists of the era, died after a week of pneumonia. He was 80 years old. Paderewski was born on November 6, 1860 in a village in Podolia, Russian Poland. His father was a land agent, and he spent most of his later years in prison in order to restore his country's freedom. His maternal grandfather was a Polish patriot who was exiled to Siberia, so his mother was born there. Because she spent her childhood in snow and ice, she was in poor health and died shortly after giving birth to Paderewski. Although Paderewski had held the belief of restoring his country from an early age, he suffered repeated setbacks. It was not until the outbreak of the First World War at the age of 54 that the dream of an independent Poland had a chance of realization. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, he completely abandoned his artistic research and devoted himself to the work of liberating his country. In 1917, he organized a volunteer army among the Poles in America. After the United States entered the war, he was recognized as the representative of the Polish people in the United States. President Wilson's famous Fourteen Points, issued on January 8, 1918, specifically focused on the issue of Polish independence in its thirteenth point. Paderewski's struggle had not yet achieved results at this point. When he went to London and Paris, he was told that Poland would not be invited to attend the peace conference unless it could establish a government representing the entire nation within Poland. Paderewski immediately rushed to Warsaw and cooperated sincerely with Piłsudski, one in charge of military affairs and the other in charge of diplomacy. After repeated efforts, they were able to win victory at the Paris Peace Conference. An independent Poland had become a reality and gained an outlet to the sea. After taking office as the first Prime Minister, he eventually disagreed with Piłsudski and resigned on December 9, 1919. In 1921, he left Poland and politics and returned to his villa in Boisson, near Lausanne, Switzerland, which he had purchased before the war to recover. At this time, he had dedicated all his savings to the country and was once again a poor man. Forced by livelihood, he returned to America to perform piano, where he was welcomed everywhere. In the first season, he earned 100,000 pounds sterling. Since then, he has been known as a master pianist all over the world. He was married twice. His first wife was Ms. Kassak, a childhood sweetheart, who died a year after their marriage. His second marriage took place in 1899, and his wife, Baroness Rosen, also died in 1934.</p>
<h3>British Planes Bombard Syrian Territory; General Dentz's Private Residence; Nebek Confirmed as British-Occupied; Syrian Refugees Continue to Flee to Turkey</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 30th - A British communiqué released here last night stated that British forces had achieved partial progress in various areas of Syria and that the fighting was continuing. General Dentz's proclamation, however, declared, "The British army's efforts to break our resistance have not been successful," but admitted that Vichy forces in the southern Lebanese mountains had withdrawn from some outposts under artillery cover. The proclamation also stated, "British forces have made contact with our forces in the Nebek area, and enemy troops who penetrated our lines northwest of Damascus have been heavily attacked, suffering severe damage and retreating. The French garrison in Palmyra was heavily attacked on June 28th but continues to resist bravely and launched a partial counterattack. Enemy planes bombed Tair Sole, causing slight casualties among civilians." The Vichy News Agency subsequently reported that Nebek, 35 miles northeast of Damascus, had been occupied by Allied forces. Italian refugees fleeing Syria are now continuously arriving in Istanbul, taking long-distance buses to the Bulgarian capital. A dispatch from the Independent French News Agency in Istanbul stated that postal communication between the area and Europe has been completely cut off, with communication only possible with Britain and the Soviet Union. Due to the difficulty of communication with Europe, Turkey is currently accelerating the construction of two railway lines to Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 30th - The French military headquarters released a military report last night stating that the British army's attempts to break the French army's resistance had been ineffective. British warships continued to bombard French positions along the coast. French forces in the southern Lebanese mountains have retreated under the cover of artillery. The situation in Panzer Gorge has not changed. Enemy troops who penetrated French lines northwest of Damascus suffered heavy losses. The defenders of Palmyra, although bombarded by British planes, continued to resist bravely and launched a counterattack on June 28th. The French air force coordinated with ground troops. Tair Sole was bombed by British planes, causing slight casualties among civilians. Forty British soldiers have been captured in the past two days, including one colonel. It is solemnly declared that all prisoners were captured by French forces, not German forces. Only French forces are defending Syria.</p>
<p>Havas, Beirut, 29th - British planes bombed the private residence of General Dentz, the French High Commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, at 5:45 PM today, dropping a total of fifteen bombs. General Dentz and his wife were not at home, so they were unharmed. Five people were killed and four injured. According to sources here, there are no military targets in the vicinity of General Dentz's private residence, and it is the location of various charitable organizations. The French Red Cross meets there every day to carry out relief work, but fortunately, no meeting was held today.</p>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 30th - A Royal Air Force communiqué last night stated that Australian Royal Air Force American fighter planes shot down and destroyed six Vichy "Martin" bombers. These French aircraft were attempting to attack British forces near Palmyra, an air force base and transportation hub in Syria. There were no losses to British fighter planes. The communiqué stated, "The Royal Air Force bombed warehouses near Baalbek and other military targets in Rayak, with considerable success."</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 30th - The British Middle East Headquarters issued the following communiqué today: There has been no change in Libya. In Syria, our forces have completed the encirclement of Palmyra. Our forces continue to advance in Damascus and the coastal areas. The situation in the central area is largely unchanged. According to the official French news agency, Beirut was subjected to three heavy bombings between 10 and 11 PM last night, killing four civilians and injuring six. Meanwhile, news from London indicates that British authorities are now transporting 400 tons of food to Damascus daily, starting from the day the city was occupied. This news comes from responsible sources in London, which shows that rumors that the British are allowing the residents of Damascus to starve are unfounded.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Nine Americans Arrested on Suspicion of Espionage</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 30th - Twenty-nine people have been arrested here on suspicion of espionage. This is the largest number of arrests of espionage suspects since the Espionage Act was passed.</p>
<h3>American Aviation Expert Discusses Air Force Power</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 30th - American aviation expert Savsky recently published an article arguing that naval escorts alone cannot break the German blockade of Britain. Savsky pointed out that the greatest threat to navigation currently comes from the air. Bombers and destroyers are more important than the navy in protecting the sea lanes of communication from America to Britain, the third and last route. Savsky's article stated that the American people and their leaders now recognize the great importance of air power in the development and outcome of this war, but this recognition did not begin with the outbreak of the war. The significant losses inflicted on British merchant ships by Hitler's long-range bombers may have been a factor in prompting this awareness among Americans. Semi-official sources have indicated that at least half of the goods shipped from the United States to Britain have been sunk by aircraft. The proportion of ships sunk is increasing daily, as Hitler has been able to gradually send more four-engine Focke-Wulf Condor aircraft into the British blockade line. US Secretary of War Henry Stimson recently stated in a broadcast that the British Isles are not only under direct threat of air strikes but also under threat of supply shortages. Not only military supplies but also the food needed by the British people is gradually being cut off by the Nazi blockade. Therefore, we must not ignore the fact that bombers and destroyers are far more important than the navy in overcoming the German threat in the Atlantic Ocean when considering the widely discussed convoy issue. It should be known that the air force can engage enemy aircraft in the skies above the sea, but the navy cannot. Aircraft can also detect and destroy submarines, and their effectiveness is far greater than that of surface warships. Moreover, aircraft have strong speed, observation, and combat capabilities, making them the commanders protecting and directing the actions of surface warships. Convoys cannot reduce losses and achieve time efficiency without the assistance of the air force.</p>

<h3>An Analysis of Japanese Naval Power</h3>
<p>—Translated from the London Daily Telegraph—</p>
<p>The tonnage of the Japanese Navy fleet ranks third in the world, behind only the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>From Japan's point of view, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 was clearly designed to keep Japan in this inferior position. This feeling persisted until the London Naval Conference of 1935-36. At that time, the Japanese delegation proposed a complex plan, the so-called "common increase in quotas," which, as the name suggests, was a request for equal fleets among the three countries. However, considering Japan's particularly advantageous strategic position and the lack of distant overseas territories, its superiority at sea has already surpassed that of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>After Japan's proposal failed, it withdrew from the conference and has since been in cahoots with the "Berlin-Rome Axis." At the same time, the government of that country kept the situation of shipbuilding and general naval construction a closely guarded secret. Once involved, there were suspicions of espionage. Under such absolute secrecy, it is naturally difficult to know the exact number of the country's new and old ships, but the following list of ships is not far from the truth.</p>
<p>Japan currently has ten battleships in active service. Among them, the "Kongo," "Haruna," "Kirishima," and "Hiei" are sister ships, each with a displacement of 29,330 tons, launched between 1912 and 1913. They have been greatly renovated over the years. Although the "Hiei" was converted into a training ship in accordance with the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and was not included in the regular fleet, it is generally believed that the ship has now been restored to its former glory. Each of the four ships is equipped with eight 14-inch guns and ten 6-inch guns.</p>
<p>The "Fuso" and "Yamashiro" were both launched between 1913 and 1914, and the "Ise" and "Hyuga" were both launched between 1916 and 1917. The displacement of the four ships is the same as that of the "Kongo." The former two are equipped with twelve 14-inch guns and sixteen 5.5-inch guns. The "Nagato" and "Mutsu" were launched between 1919 and 1920, with a displacement increased to 32,720 tons, equipped with nine 16-inch guns and twenty 5.5-inch guns.</p>
<p>It is generally observed that there are at least five battleships under construction, all with a displacement of more than 40,000 tons and the same number of guns as the "Nagato." Among them, the "Nissin" and "Takasaki" were reportedly launched in November 1939 and April 1940, respectively, and may be incorporated into the fleet within the year.</p>
<p>There are also three or four pocket battleships. Among them, the "Kashino" was launched in January 1940, and the "Yawata" was launched in April of the same year, and they have likely been incorporated into the fleet. The rumored "Kakure" was completed a year earlier. Each ship has a displacement of 11,000 to 15,000 tons and is equipped with six 12-inch guns, making them very powerful.</p>
<p>Japan currently has seven aircraft carriers. The largest, "Akagi" and "Kaga," have a displacement of 26,900 tons each and were completed between 1927 and 1928, and later renovated. Each ship is equipped with ten 8-inch guns and sixteen 4.7-inch guns and can carry 50 to 60 aircraft. Next are the "Hiryu," "Soryu," and "Ryujo," each with a displacement of 10,050 tons, completed between 1937 and 1940. Each ship can carry 30 to 40 aircraft and is equipped with twelve 5-inch guns. The smallest, the "Ryujo" (completed in 1933), has a displacement of 7,100 tons, and the "Hosho" (completed in 1921) has a displacement of 7,470 tons. The former is equipped with the same guns as the "Hiryu" and other ships. The latter is equipped with four 5.5-inch guns. Each carries 20 to 25 aircraft.</p>
<p>There are at least two recently completed aircraft carriers, namely the "Zuiho" and "Shokaku," both launched in 1939, with a displacement of approximately 14,000 to 20,000 tons. They can carry approximately 45 aircraft and are equipped with twelve 5-inch guns.</p>
<p>There are twelve first-class cruisers. Among them, the "Atago," "Maya," "Takao," "Chokai," "Nachi," "Myoko," "Ashigara," and "Haguro" have displacements ranging from 9,850 to 10,000 tons and are equipped with ten 8-inch guns. The "Aoba," "Kako," "Furutaka," and "Kinugasa" each have a displacement of 7,100 tons and are equipped with six 8-inch guns. All ships were launched between 1925 and 1931. Other cruisers such as the "Tone" and "Chikuma" (completed in 1937-38) have a displacement of 8,500 tons and are equipped with twelve 6.1-inch guns. The "Mogami," "Mikuma," "Suzuya," and "Kumano" (completed in 1934-36) have a displacement of 8,500 tons and are equipped with fifteen 6.1-inch guns. The "Abukuma" and "Natori" are fourteen light cruisers (completed in 1919-25) with a displacement of 5,100 to 5,195 tons and are equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns. The "Yubari" (completed in 1923) has a displacement of 2,890 tons and is equipped with six 5.5-inch guns. The "Tenryu" and "Tatsuta" (completed in 1918) are equipped with guns that can only fire 82-pound shells, which are inferior to the 6-inch guns of other countries. Therefore, later warships were equipped with 6.1-inch guns that fired 120-pound shells to increase their strength.</p>
<p>There are at least five newly built cruisers, with displacements of 8,000 to 9,000 tons. Among them, the "Tsugaru" was launched in Yokosuka East Port in June 1940, and the "Hashidate" and "Kakuda" were launched in large numbers in 1939. Each ship is approximately equipped with twelve 6.1-inch guns.</p>
<p>There are more than one hundred destroyers in active service, with displacements ranging from 770 to 2,000 tons. Many more are either under construction or have been completed. The destroyers are named after wind, cloud, snow, and moon, with poetic meanings, such as "Matsukaze," "Tachikaze," "Oboro," "Minegumo," "Shirayuki," "Mochizuki," and "Onibi."</p>
<p>There are at least 60 to 70 submarines. The newest type of submarine has also been built in five units, with a displacement of 2,190 tons, equipped with eight torpedo tubes and one 5.5-inch gun. The smallest old-style submarines have a displacement of only 655 tons and were completed in 1923, but there are only three of them.</p>
<p>Two recently completed coastal defense ships were originally cruiser replacements. Named "Kashima" and "Katori," each has a displacement of 5,800 tons and is equipped with four 5.5-inch guns. The speed is only 18 knots per hour, but they can be used to carry heavy mines. There are six mine layers, with displacements ranging from 1,135 to 9,240 tons. There are thirteen torpedo boats, ranging from 443 to 720 tons.</p>
<p>Eight old-style cruisers (completed in 1899-1902) are equipped and have been classified as coastal defense ships. There are also eleven seaplane transports (eight of which can be used for commercial purposes), thirteen submarine sweepers, eighteen mine sweepers, two coastal defense ships, nine river gunboats, and many auxiliary ships, such as repair ships, supply ships, oil tankers, and transport ships.</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers exaggerate the attack power of the fleet too much, but in fact, the ships' hulls are overloaded. Since the 1920s, the Japanese Navy has been trying to accomplish great things with limited tonnage, which has become an irreversible trend. As a result, the torpedo boat "Tomozuru" capsized when it first went to sea on a cloudy day due to excessive gun weight. After much effort, it was rescued, but many lives were lost. It was also heard that the four "Mogami"-class cruisers were extremely unstable during sea trials and were only incorporated into the fleet after major modifications, which was still unsatisfactory. The later "Chikuma" and "Tone" completely changed their approach, reducing the number of 6.1-inch guns from fifteen to twelve.</p>
<p>As for the number of Japanese naval officers and soldiers, the last count was 10,700, but it has now been expanded considerably.</p>

<h3>Britain Launches Large-Scale Aid China Movement on "July 7th" Incident; "One Bowl of Rice" Fundraiser Dinner on the 17th; Written Appeal to British People to Strengthen Aid</h3>
<p>The British China Aid Committee is currently preparing a large-scale commemoration of China's eighth year of resistance and construction for freedom. Starting from the eve of July 7th, a nationwide expansion of China aid propaganda will be held. It has been decided to raise £1,000 from all sectors and remit it to China on "July 7th," and to use this day as the central starting point for a nationwide China aid movement. At that time, hundreds of thousands of propaganda pamphlets titled "Four Years of Resistance and Construction" will be distributed, detailing the special progress made by China in developing its original strength during the war and pointing out China's construction work to promote China aid among the British people.</p>
<p>China Aid Movements Held in Various Places</p>
<p>A fundraising dinner will be held on July 17th to raise funds for the relief of Chinese war victims. Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, will be invited to attend and preside over the event. At the same time, commemorative meetings will be held in various places to make the British people understand that China has assumed its current work in the struggle to liberate the world from the enslavement of the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Chinese-Related Programs</p>
<p>During the expanded China aid propaganda period, the China Aid Committee will jointly publish articles in major newspapers across the UK and London and formulate radio programs related to China, such as Chinese poetry and introductions to the living conditions of the Chinese people, to be broadcast on radio stations in various places.</p>
<p>Appeal for Donations on the Eve of July 7th</p>
<p>On the eve of July 7th (Sunday), churches will appeal to worshipers to donate to aid Chinese refugees. Hundreds of school boards have written China aid essay contests. The China Aid Committee has helped organize an industrial organization to link British aid with the work of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement.</p>
<p>Open Letter The Chairman of the China Aid Committee, Lord Listowel, published an article in the Manchester Guardian for the "July 7th China Aid Movement," calling on the British people to donate more to China's war effort to strengthen the strength of one of the three pillars of world freedom. Another open letter was also published, stating: "This year, July 7th marks the fifth year of China's war to defend freedom and national survival. We now intend to raise a special donation on July 7th to donate to China. In order to promote the effectiveness of China aid, we must continue to promote propaganda and practical work in the UK. The biggest shortcoming of the Western people is the lack of awareness. When Japan invaded China, China was insufficiently prepared in material terms, and the Western people were also insufficiently aware in terms of thinking and lacked understanding of the importance of Eastern events. How to strengthen genuine aid to China and promote improved policies are the dual responsibilities of the China Aid Committee. In today's turbulent situation, we dare not stop working, because we believe that this work is also preparing a new path for the future of the Chinese and British people. May you help our efforts."</p>
<p>Fundraising Results of All-American Chinese Assistance Federation Inserting Badges</p>
<p>New York News, the All-American Chinese Assistance Federation held street fundraising by inserting badges in New York on May 19, 22, 23, and 3. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. According to the association, the results of this fundraising campaign were excellent. One hundred sixty-seventy Chinese and American women participated, and forty to fifty American socialites and famous "models" also participated. Chinese women participants were all invited by Mrs. Zhao Bufan and worked hard, including the Overseas Chinese Women's New Movement Association, the Women's慰勞慰劳慰劳慰劳Association, male and female students from overseas Chinese schools, and other individuals. After three months of effort, approximately US$2,100 was raised. Mrs. Zhao Bufan's youngest daughter, Miss Jinqing, also received a red paper (cheque) worth US$500 from a wealthy friend to be donated to the association for refugee relief. It is heard that the family members of Mr. Sun Ke and the daughter of Mr. Lin Yutang have also joined, and their spirit is commendable and worthy of emulation.</p>
<h3>Various Industries and Markets Closed for Two Days; Abundant Funds at the End of June; Silver and Money Businesses to Resume Operations on the 3rd</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the semi-annual settlement period for the silver and money businesses in the first half of the Republic of China's 30th year. Various banks and firms completed interest payments and rushed to handle the semi-annual settlement. Although business hours were normal to the public, internal hours were extended. As the industrial and commercial sectors also handled semi-annual settlements, the receipts and disbursements were particularly heavy compared to usual. However, after adjustments across the financial sector, funds were exceptionally abundant, and all industries safely passed this end-of-June settlement period.</p>
<p>Extended Exchange and Lowered Discount Rates</p>
<p>The Bills Clearing House of the United Bank Preparatory Committee, in order to facilitate the exchange of bills between peer companies, specifically extended the bill exchange time for the settlement day of the first half of the Republic of China's 30th year to 4:45 PM. The original exchange time was from 3:15 PM, which is a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes. However, the time for collecting bills remained the same. Members of the Money Industry Association carried out settlements, which were usually at the end of the lunar year, but now, in order to facilitate settlements, they are conducting a regular settlement at the end of June. They have already started to handle this separately. Regarding the money market discount rate, since the influx of Shanghai capital has increased funds, the market discount rate has dropped to 3%. The discount rate for June has been resolved by the association to be 2%.</p>
<p>Various Industries Closed During the Settlement Period</p>
<p>Silver and money businesses will be closed for two days from today and will resume operations on July 3rd. Various industries and markets, such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, yarn and flowers, cotton, tobacco exchange, hardware, beans, rice, and grains, will be closed for two days from July 1st due to end-of-June settlements and will reopen for business on July 3rd. Foreign banks will also be closed for two days according to past practice. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau announced yesterday: "The Bureau will suspend the withdrawal of deposits on July 1st and 2nd as it is a period for settling semi-annual deposit interest." The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will not be closed to the public on these two days but will suspend deposits and withdrawals for two days to handle settlements. Depositors are urged to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Cargo Transportation to be Controlled; Similar to the Situation in Various Ports Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>It is learned that in order to control cargo transportation in the occupied areas, the Japanese side has ordered various business groups to organize trade associations. It is stipulated that if various businesses want to transport goods through Ningbo, they must apply through the trade association. Without a trade association, no accommodation can be made. Therefore, businesses will have many procedures to go through to transport goods in the future, and free transportation is no longer allowed. This situation will be the same as cargo transportation at the ports along the Yangtze River. Although the detailed measures have not yet been specified, it is expected that they will be implemented after the issue of commercial ship resumption is resolved.</p>
<h3>French Police Strictly Punish Rice Weevils; Determined to Fight Against Unscrupulous Merchants; Yong'an Rice Shop Changed Scale Capacity; Ordered to Close and Guards Sent</h3>
<p>The French police learned that the owner of Yong'an Rice Shop at No. 60 Xin Yong'an Street had used a file to lower the edges of the scales and other utensils used in the shop, reducing their capacity to exploit the common people and seek exorbitant profits. After verifying the above-mentioned circumstances, the police arrested the shop owner, revoked his license, ordered the shop to close, and sent guards to watch over it.</p>
<p>Cheating Situation</p>
<p>The cheating method was to reduce the original capacity of a five-liter utensil that could hold four kilograms to 3.92 kilograms, a two-jin utensil that could hold 1.6 kilograms to 1.56 kilograms, and a one-liter utensil that could hold 800 grams to 700 grams. The police hope that citizens who are aware of the cheating situation of various rice weevils will report it to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>Warehouse Rice to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the first batch of 27,150 bags of public warehouse small broken rice will arrive on the 4th, loaded on the Gran ship managed by the Norwegian firm Wah Lun Trading Company. The Lykee Trading Company has begun preparations for picking up the goods and storing them in warehouses today. It is heard that the public warehouse small broken rice will be issued to various rice shops for sale only after the first phase of foreign rice imported by the Public Works Department has been sold. The rice will be directly distributed to various rice shops by the Public Works Department and will no longer go through the hands of various miscellaneous grain stores. A senior staff member of the Xiang Mao Foreign Firm stated, "When he was inspecting the sales reports submitted daily by various rice shops selling foreign rice from the Public Works Department, he discovered that the number of sales filled in on the report of a certain rice shop was actually greater than the number purchased. This move is clearly contrary to the sales rules. Although the rice shop claimed that this was because the number of sales suddenly increased and they did not have time to purchase from the authorities, but temporarily transferred the goods from neighboring rice shops, whether this statement is credible or not, the authorities have long ago announced a clear stipulation that 'rice shops must not transfer foreign rice from the Public Works Department to another rice shop.'"</p>
<h3>Celebration of US Independence Day; Shanghai Businessmen Participate; Blessing for President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>The fourth of this month marked the 152nd anniversary of the founding of the United States. American expatriates in Shanghai and American authorities in Shanghai felt that celebrating this national holiday was especially necessary at a time when their country was helping democratic nations strive for victory. On that day at noon, the American Consul General, Lockwood, and all the American expatriates, held a social gathering and luncheon at the American Country Club on Great West Road to celebrate together. The American Chamber of Commerce also convened all its members at 12:30 p.m. on the same day to raise a toast to bless the nation. A celebratory ceremony was held at 1:00 p.m. Chinese business leaders, believing that the United States was intensifying its aid to China, and that the two countries shared the responsibility of establishing world peace, felt they should celebrate even more. They attended the celebratory banquet on this day to bless President Roosevelt of the United States.</p>
<h3>Public Notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council; Levying of Autumn Property Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the autumn property tax and the second half of the year's land tax would be levied starting July 1st. The Council will not send staff to collect land tax and property tax for Western-style houses. Landlords and residents, upon receiving the payment notice from the Council, should submit their taxes to the Tax Section at 109 Jiangxi Road for verification and collection. The tax collectors dispatched by the Council will carry identification documents with their photographs attached for identification. Taxpayers must pay attention when paying taxes.</p>
<h3>Slight Improvement in Living Standards After Small-Grain Rice Enters the Market; Shanghai Municipal Council Releases June Cost of Living Report; Purchasing Power of National Currency Increases by Half a Cent Compared to May</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council released the Shanghai workers' cost of living index and commodity price situation for June of this year, stating that since August of last year, the cost of living index for Chinese workers in Shanghai had only decreased this June. This was due to the entry of small-grain rice into the market, which immediately improved the rice market situation. Sales of small-grain rice far exceeded those of other types of rice. Previously, Saigon rice was used in this index, but small-grain rice was used starting in June. The total index for May was 802.68, and for June it was 772.82, a decrease of 29.86 points, or 3.72%. The purchasing power of the national currency increased from 1 jiao 2 fen 4 li 6 hao in May to 1 jiao 2 fen 9 li 4 hao, an increase of half a cent.</p>
<p>Prices of Food and Clothing Both Decrease Slightly</p>
<p>The food category index saw a significant decrease in June, while the clothing category saw a slight decrease. The fuel and miscellaneous categories increased slightly. The changes in June are shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Category Percentage Increase or Decrease Compared to Last Month</p>
<p>Food Category Decreased by 5.33</p>
<p>Clothing Category Decreased by 0.07</p>
<p>Fuel Category Increased by 0.38</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category Increased by 0.55</p>
<p>Within the food category, rice prices decreased, and vegetable prices also fell. However, fish and meat products were particularly expensive. Among fuels, firewood prices fell, but coal briquettes still rose. As a result of price changes in various clothing categories, there was a slight decrease, and demand was not strong due to the warmer weather. Among miscellaneous items, writing paper and soap fell in price, but other items continued to rise. The average price of indica rice was 109 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen per dan.</p>
<p>Required Income for Workers' Living Expenses</p>
<p>The following figures represent the actual income of the head of a worker's household and other family members, as well as other income in the household. Actual income refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of worker household income distribution and cost of living expenses in June. The table below shows the income required to maintain the first type of life (i.e., living standard A) below that of 1936, and the second type (i.e., living standard B) at a minimum.</p>
<p>Percentage Living Standard A Living Standard B</p>
<p>Income of Head of Household 53.3 86.10 79.86</p>
<p>Income of Other Family Members 34.0 5.92 50.94</p>
<p>Other Income in the Household 12.7 20.52 19.03</p>
<p>Total 100.0 161.536 149.834</p>
<p>Note This index is compiled based on the living standards of workers before the war in 1936. Recently, due to rising costs and declining living standards, the cost increased by 6.16 times in June of this year, based on the degree of reduction.</p>
<h3>Professor Malley Discusses Facts; China Will Surely Achieve Final Victory; Its National Spirit and Strength Far Exceed Those of Other Countries; Japan Is Exhausted and Unable to Support Itself</h3>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the American Independence Day, the Shanghai English-language newspaper "The China Press" issued a special "Light of Democracy" edition yesterday to commemorate the occasion. The publication praised the democratic nations of China, Britain, and the United States. One article, titled "Can China Win?", was written by Professor Malley of National Jinling University, who praised China's high national spirit and its spirit of arduous struggle, which far exceeded that of countries such as France and Belgium. He stated that Japan is now exhausted, and if China can unite from top to bottom, persevere to the end, and ensure that foreign aid from the Yunnan-Burma Road is not cut off, then the final victory will undoubtedly belong to China. The full text is translated below:</p>
<p>China's National Spirit Is Very High</p>
<p>"When the air raid sirens sounded, the 500,000 citizens of Chengdu realized that a crisis was coming and quickly evacuated outside the city, lying down under the shady trees for four hours. They then saw Japanese planes appearing over Chengdu, dropping hundreds of bombs in a few seconds. After the bombing was over, they returned to their homes, and although they heard about the tragic situation caused by the air raid, they were not panicked at all, but dealt with it with a steadfast spirit. In less than an hour, the alert was lifted, and they continued their work. This is a glimpse of China after nearly four years of war. China's resistance to aggression has been more persistent and tenacious than that of France, Belgium, etc.</p>
<p>The War Policy Has Achieved Great Results</p>
<p>"To date, it is Japan, not China, that seeks peace, because the latter insists that Japanese troops must withdraw from China before there is room for negotiation. Therefore, the spirit of the Chinese nation is deeply admirable, and the patriotism inherent in its people is beyond our imagination. If China can get sufficient supplies of arms and ammunition, and if the country can unite, it will undoubtedly achieve final victory. China's determination to fight the war has already achieved great results, and dawn is already breaking.</p>
<p>Japan Is Finding It Difficult to Maintain Face</p>
<p>"In fact, it is now Japan, not China, that is retreating. Japan has now withdrawn from the entire province of Guangxi, part of Guangdong, and several places along the Yangtze River, which proves that the strength of the Chinese army has gradually increased. The only weapon that the Japanese side relies on for counterattack is propaganda. Although the Japanese side avoids saying that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is 'voluntary', if the Tokyo side claims that it will send troops to occupy the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Myanmar, and other places, then this kind of statement is nothing more than to maintain 'face'. It can be seen that under the attack of the regular army and guerrillas in China, the Japanese army has had to retreat. Since it has had to retreat, and also wants to preserve 'face', its predicament is obvious. Japan has not been able to occupy the whole of China, nor has it been able to control the whole of China, so it has had to do its best to preserve its 'face'.</p>
<p>Unable to Control the Occupied Areas</p>
<p>"The Japanese side often calls itself 'occupying', but it has not succeeded. For example, on the Jinghu Road, which is under strict Japanese surveillance, trains are derailed by bombs every few days. Also, in a certain city where countless Japanese troops are stationed, Chinese officials can still work as usual and collect taxes, and send them to the Chinese government. This is a glimpse of what the Japanese call an occupied area. At present, the Japanese army must defend both the front and the rear at the same time, just like a boxer who thinks he is invincible and does not need to pay attention to the other party's deep-seated considerations. In fact, the most difficult thing for the Japanese army at present is that it cannot control the guerrillas in the occupied areas. Its troops and weapons, I don't know, before they could even fight, all fell into the hands of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>The Strength of the Chinese Army Is Growing Day by Day</p>
<p>"The strength of the Chinese army is growing day by day. For example, the Chinese army once had the strength to take back the entire province of Shanxi during the winter, but the military authorities did not want to do so, and dismissed the idea, believing that this would contain a strong force on the other side. We know that the Chinese guerrillas in that area are very strong and can destroy the Japanese army and its equipment. The Japanese army cannot obtain supplies in the occupied areas, because the Chinese people refuse to hand them over, and sometimes even burn their agricultural products in advance to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese army has to obtain agricultural supplies from its own country, which is really the least economical.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Raids Are Not Worth the Loss</p>
<p>"In the early stages of the war, the Japanese side needed 25 million yen per day for war expenses. In economic terms, Japan has been losing out in everything. If Chongqing is bombed every day, the duration of the bombing is longer than that of any other city in the world, and there is no place in the world that has suffered as much damage as Chongqing, but the cost to the Japanese side is far greater than the cost to the Chinese side for reconstruction. Chongqing's air-raid shelters are like a public gathering place, because the facilities are safe, and people often talk, laugh, play, and discuss sleeping in the shelters, just like in peacetime. The speed of construction of this project is far faster than that of European countries, and it is still under construction today, such as for the storage of cars, gasoline, and other supplies.</p>
<p>China Has the Factors for Victory</p>
<p>"The Chinese people now deeply believe that the Japanese army will eventually be defeated, which is an undoubted fact, so every person hardly talks about this issue every day. The Chinese people are now constantly engaged in production for their motherland, regardless of hardships, to supply the war, and a part of them are drawn from them to fill the regular army and guerrillas. The key to China's victory in the war is due to their steadfast spirit. They are all very interested in this kind of daily life. Now that the United States has taken strong action against Japan, and China can unite internally, these are all factors that will contribute to China's final victory.</p>
<h3>Central Broadcasting Station Broadcasts to the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>The Central Government expresses its deep concern for the people in the occupied areas who are struggling arduously, fearing that they cannot obtain real news. The Central Broadcasting Station broadcasts to the people in the occupied areas every day from 2:30 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., which is said to have started on the 19th of last month. People in all occupied areas who have radios can tune in on time.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai West Tax Collection Issue; Near Resolution; Said to be Completed by the End of the Month; Joint Tax Bureau to be Established in the Western District</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "The China Press", it is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Central District authorities will resume consultations on the issue of tax collection on the roads outside the Shanghai West Concession this week. At that time, representatives from both sides will hold a formal meeting in the Central District, and the tax collection issue is expected to be closer to a resolution. It is said that the discussion may be completed by the end of this month, and then the revised tax collection method will be implemented in the outer road area. It is heard that the progress of this consultation has been satisfactory so far, with only a few minor issues and general details still to be resolved, after which a complete agreement can be reached. It is noted that the previous high-level meeting on this matter was held in the Shanghai Municipal Council Building in May, after which the two sides had several informal talks.

<h3>Travelers to the US Must Obtain Approval from the US State Department; This New Law Will Take Effect Today; Prevent Foreigners from Entering the US to Engage in Illegal Activities</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the US State Department recently promulgated a new law, which will take effect today, stipulating that foreigners traveling to the United States must first obtain the approval of the US State Department, and then submit the application for approval to the consulate of the country where the applicant is located, and the US consulate will then issue a visa on the passport. Therefore, travelers to the United States from Shanghai or other Far Eastern ports will generally need two or three months to complete this procedure. According to US officials yesterday, the main reason for changing this visa procedure is to strengthen the national defense plan, to prevent foreigners from entering the United States at this time to engage in illegal activities. Therefore, entrants must have a personal resume and must sign an oath not to conspire to undermine the current US government. Students studying in the United States must also prepare the same documents and attach supporting documents to be sent to the US State Department for prior review.</p>

<h3>Verdict on the Assassin of Commander Xie; Commander Lei Issues a Statement; Commander Xie's Usual Focus is on Influencing People with Personality; The Assassin's Confession is Absurd</h3>
<p>The four rebel soldiers who assassinated Commander Xie were prosecuted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and after several trials by the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, were sentenced to death the other day. Commander Lei of the battalion issued a statement yesterday saying that the commander always focuses on influencing people with personality as the first priority. The bizarre behavior and impure thoughts of the four rebel soldiers were long known to the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion, but the commander always held the attitude that sincerity can move mountains and diligently persuaded them, unwilling to send them to court, which would tarnish the past glory of the entire battalion. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred. According to Commander Lei, the commander paid the most attention to the nutrition of the soldiers during his lifetime. All comrades in the battalion were sure to be full at every meal. The physique of our soldiers can make this clear. The so-called poor treatment and insufficient food of the rebel soldiers is purely fabricated and not worth refuting. In addition, the commander's finances have always been very open. All income and expenditure accounts are published monthly, and there is also an internal economic committee (composed of ten people elected by all officers and soldiers). The so-called undisclosed external donations of the rebel soldiers are even more absurd and not worth arguing. According to Commander Lei, the rebellious behavior of the four rebel soldiers was obviously premeditated.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, On June 28th of this year, according to Qi Zhaokang, the owner of Run Kangyong Yarn Company, our firm was entrusted with the task of suspending business and liquidation due to the influence of the market, and appointed a representative to handle it. After our lawyers accepted the commission, we immediately went to the company with the clerk to carry out the liquidation as usual, and the company's accountant and executor transferred the existing twenty warehouse receipts for Shuangma cotton yarn, twenty bags, as well as 92.5 yuan in cash, account books, documents, seals, etc. for takeover. At this time, some creditors requested that our lawyers deliver the warehouse receipts to offset debts, which was opposed by our lawyers and other creditors, resulting in a stalemate. Therefore, our lawyers reported the matter to the police and handed over all the above-mentioned items to the police for custody at the same time. This is the fact of the matter. As for whether the owner of the company is fraudulent, it is a question of the outcome of the trial, which is completely separate from the lawyer's acceptance of the liquidation, and when the lawyer accepts the principal's liquidation, it is impossible to suspend judgment on whether he is fraudulent. Now, reading the news published in your newspaper on June 29th of this year, the facts are not entirely consistent. We hereby send a letter, hoping that you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, Lawyer Qian Shusheng, June 30th.</p>

<p>Zhen Dan University Graduation Ceremony: Photo of French Ambassador, Mr. Cosme, Presenting Diplomas (Photographer: H.F. Pan)</p>
<p>History of the University</p>
<p>Zhen Dan University was founded in 1903 and has a history of 28 years. It is the only university established by the French Catholic Church in China. It was founded by Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and the initial campus was located at the old site of the Xujiahui Meteorological Observatory. In 1908, it moved to Lujiawan. Subsequently, school buildings were gradually added and managed with meticulous care, resulting in the Zhen Dan University of today. In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was approved and registered by the Ministry of Education. Currently, it is divided into three departments: Law, Science, Engineering, and Medicine, and the curriculum is known for its strictness.</p>

<h3>Yanjing University Enrolls Students in Shanghai: Registration Begins Today, Official Examinations Begin on the 10th</h3>
<p>Since Yanjing University of Beiping decided to enroll students in Shanghai, many people have been going to the YMCA Vocational Guidance Center to inquire about the application process. It has been learned that the person in charge of Yanjing University's enrollment in Shanghai arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to the person in charge, who spoke to a reporter from Shenjiang News, the current environment at Yanjing University is quite good. Students also have considerable freedom in extracurricular activities. Most of the professors are full-time and rarely hold positions at other schools, so they can focus on teaching. As for the number of students to be admitted, it will not be too many, but the questions will not be very difficult. Therefore, anyone who has graduated from a senior high school that is registered with the Ministry of Education and managed carefully can give it a try. Those who wish to apply can register starting today (the 1st) at 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The official examinations are scheduled to begin on July 10. As for the examination location, it may be held at the McTyeire School for Girls on Yidingpan Road. The person in charge also stated that the most important thing in the Yanjing University exam is the intelligence test. The test appears to be very easy on the surface, but it requires a calm mind and quick thinking, otherwise it will be difficult to answer. This is because some questions are very easy, but there is not enough time, or the large number of questions can cause mental confusion. As for Chinese, it focuses on new literature. The essay topics that are decided upon are also mostly new literature topics. In addition, there may also be translation (classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese) and new-style punctuation. The school attaches great importance to English. For essays, attention must be paid to sentence structure, grammar, and thought. If any of the three are lacking, it will be difficult to be selected. In addition, there is a "reading comprehension" test, which requires reading a classical Chinese text within a limited time and answering the questions listed within a specified time. Therefore, close attention must be paid during reading, and answers must be concise and rapid. The school's math exams are different from those of other universities. The materials are often easy, but there are many questions, so it is difficult to answer them all. There are also English questions included from time to time. There is nothing special to mention about the natural science and knowledge tests. In addition, the school's fees are very low. For ordinary students, in addition to tuition of 55 yuan per semester, board is only 80 yuan and lodging is only 20 yuan, so the annual cost will not exceed 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Center for the Unemployed Holds School Affairs Meeting to Discuss Reorganization Plans for the Next Semester</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Center for the Unemployed will end the current semester soon, so it convened its third school affairs meeting on June 29 to discuss reorganization plans for the next semester. Chairman Zhang, Director of Academic Affairs Zhu, Inspector Chen, and principals of various voluntary primary and secondary schools, including Li Baiqiang, Tao Yayu, Dai Qirui, Jin Chengyun, Li Guanghua, Wu Yueqiu, and Xue Huijin, attended, totaling over 20 people. Chairman Zhang, as chairman of the meeting, first led everyone in standing up to observe a moment of silence in memory of the late director, Mr. Zhou Jiyun. Then, he reported on the financial situation and academic situation of the current semester, stating: "This center was established for poor children who are unemployed, and the number of poor children is increasing due to environmental pressures. The center's funding comes entirely from donations from enthusiastic people in the community. Since we are serving poor children, we must do our best in our positions to achieve the greatest effect with the least amount of funds. What is the greatest effect? It is hoping that every poor child does not lose the opportunity to attend school. If so, we will not only gain supreme satisfaction in our conscience, but we can also tell the benevolent gentlemen in the community who enthusiastically donate funds that we have no shame. Therefore, each school must meet the specified standard for the issue of filling the number of students in the coming semester. This is what I solemnly propose to report to you. As for the curriculum, it must also be practical and relevant to the application of poor children, so that in the future, poor children can use what they have learned to apply to society and obtain a solution for their livelihood. Therefore, relieving poor children from unemployment is actually relieving poor children from their future livelihoods. Thinking of this, the responsibility is even greater. I hope to encourage everyone." Many important cases were discussed. After the meeting, Chairman Zhang earnestly inquired about any difficulties the schools had and resolved them one by one. It is reported that the schools under the center are scheduled to start school on August 22 for the next semester.</p>

<h3>Xin Jian Middle School Reduces Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>Xin Jian Middle School, located at 310 Sima Road in this city and specially approved by the Ministry of Education, has the aim of helping underprivileged middle school students in Shanghai who are out of school, so the tuition fees are low and the best among the schools in Shanghai. Although it is planned to increase tuition fees appropriately starting next semester, the school authorities, in view of the high cost of living in Shanghai, have decided to reduce tuition fees as much as possible in order to reduce the burden on students' parents. The junior high school tuition is 25 yuan, and the senior high school tuition is only 35 yuan. The school is known for its strict teaching and management, so it is expected that there will be a large number of students applying for admission this year. As the school building on Sima Road is not sufficient, a second branch has been opened at 146 Jing'an Temple Road, Hadong Road. The first application date has been set for 8:00 AM on the 12th of this month, to be held simultaneously at the main and branch schools. Those who wish to study at the school can quickly go to the first branch of the school on Sima Road to register.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Guangdong Sales Continue to Be Strong, Mixed Yarn Prices Jump Wildly, Double Horse Prices Remain at Original Base, Golden Double Horse Prices Begin to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm, due to continuous demand from Hong Kong buyers. There were transactions of several hundred bales of Double Horse factory orders, with total business exceeding 2,000 bales. 23-count Golden Rooster yarn rose by 30 yuan, and there are 215 pieces to be shipped to Hong Kong today and 125 pieces to Siam. Therefore, the foundation of cotton yarn is very solid, and some in the industry remain in a bullish position, due to the increasingly tight factory orders. However, it is said in the market that the shorts have been continuously rolling over their positions, and the amount of margin they have put up is huge. Therefore, it is rumored that if prices continue to rise, the longs will completely corner the market, and there will inevitably be bankruptcies. It is feared that money will not be recovered. Therefore, at the opening yesterday morning, everyone closed out their positions at the original base price. The market once returned to level. Subsequently, it was heard that sales in the Guangdong market were brisk, and the shorts rushed to cover their positions. However, a major player who switched from short to long the previous day came back to sell, offering 6,000 bales, priced from 1,620 yuan to 1,600 yuan. As a result, the market eased, and a tense situation was alleviated. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,625 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,585 yuan. In the afternoon, as July 1st and 2nd were both holidays, there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The spot Double Horse market closed in the morning, and sentiment was relaxed. There were many different opinions. The opening price was 1,605 yuan, but a major player came out to sell, and the price fell to 1,585 yuan in an instant. It fluctuated within the 600 yuan range for a long time. Subsequently, it was heard that the Guangdong buyers were very strong, and spot yarn prices had risen by 20 to 30 yuan. Confidence was immediately boosted, and buying interest was strong. The market gradually rose to 1,625 yuan. However, a major player closed out their profits and sold, and the market eased, closing at 1,600 yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume for half a day was 11,900 bales, of which 1,900 bales were from Hong Kong buyers and 10,000 bales were speculative transactions.</p>
<p>The market situation for Golden Double Horse futures yarn turned upward, due to activity from buyers and approximately 2,000 bales in Guangdong yarn sales. As a result, confidence was boosted, and the upward trend was quite strong in the afternoon. As a result, the July contract rose by 25 yuan, and the August contract rose sharply by 36 yuan. The exchange's trading has greatly developed, due to the severe short squeeze in the spot market. New spot transactions have come to a standstill, and speculators have flocked to the futures market. The total trading volume for the day was 16,050 bales, an increase of 8,050 bales compared to the previous day. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Starting from July 3, the Double Horse futures yarn market will add September futures yarn, and the quality grades of each yarn will be consistently set lower. The main counts of the same grade are listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Are High, 3,000 More Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive Continuously</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains as firm as ever. Although American cotton has seen a correction, local inventories are decreasing daily, and the supply is unreliable. Therefore, cotton merchants unanimously anticipate a rise in prices, and cotton prices are expected to rise by 4 to 5 yuan.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton came via Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuesheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (Sunday). In addition to a large batch of foreign rice and flour, there were also 3,000 bales of Indian cotton, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Hoarding Reappears, Eastern Piece Goods Futures Also Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market continued to be firm yesterday, due to the resurgence of hoarding by both industry insiders and outsiders. Transactions were frequent, and asking prices rose sharply. White cloth, coarse cloth, and twill cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Indigo cloth and An An blue cloth rose by about 1 yuan per piece. Drills and dyed cloths from British merchants such as Lundon &amp; Co. and Jardine Matheson also rose by 1 to 1.5 yuan per piece. Over 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on Mu Street. Due to the increased consolidated tax in the coming month, large quantities of factory inventory cloth are being transferred to warehouses. Hong Kong and Guangdong buyers purchased over 200 pieces of blue cloth and dyed twills, while buyers in Rangoon and Singapore purchased over 300 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twills, coarse cloth, and floral cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: White fine cloth has seen a sharp increase in prices due to continued purchases by both actual consumers and hoarders. The leading futures contracts on the exchange opened flat for the first two rounds and then rose in a straight line from the third round onwards. As a result, the price rose sharply by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan per piece compared to the Saturday market price. The spot market initially fell and then rose, and transactions were strong. The highest selling price for leading factory warehouse receipts opened at 50 yuan, and closed slightly lower at 49.9 yuan. Dyed cloths, Four Gentlemen serge, rose to 1.6425 yuan in the afternoon. Afterwards, as the banks were closed for the holiday (July 2), retail investors took profits and sold, pushing the price down to close at 1.635 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: On July 1, there were 12 pieces of piece goods shipped to Amoy, 490 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, and 275 pieces shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Over 20,000 More Bags of Hong Kong Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market situation was stable yesterday. Both futures and spot rice saw a continued decline of over 1 yuan. However, the day before yesterday, Sunday, was a half-year closing day, and the market was closed. Local buyers saw an increase in demand, and the market was still active. However, at the opening in the morning, due to the large influx of rice arriving in recent days, and the remaining unsold portion of the public sale rice was more than 100,000 bags, and more Tribute rice and public warehouse rice being transferred to the public sale, confidence was weak. In addition, due to the month-end closing sales, the prices of all grades immediately decreased by 1 to 2 yuan after the market opened. The futures prices for Lu Road rice and Yinghua Si rice were low. The asking price for small-grained spot rice was 148 yuan, Lu Road was 147.5 yuan, futures were 146-147 yuan, and broken rice futures were 113-114 yuan. Subsequently, as spot rice sales increased and purchases rebounded, futures prices for Lu Road and Yinghua Si rice also immediately followed suit, increasing by over 1 yuan. Spot rice prices also immediately rebounded by over 1 yuan after the decline, as shops on this street and the various Zhejiang oil groups in the interior took advantage of the low prices to purchase. Therefore, in the end, the decrease was only a few cents to 1 yuan lower compared to the Saturday price. The total trading volume for the day was 22,000 bags of spot rice, 800 tons of Yinghua Si rice, the opening price of first-grade Saigon spot rice was 127.5 to 124.5 yuan, second-grade was 122 to 120 yuan, broken rice was 97 to 95.5 yuan, third-grade broken rice was 84 yuan, small-grained was 122.5 to 120 yuan, Min Dang was 131 to 126 yuan, Bo rice was 112-113 yuan, red rice was 109 yuan, the arrival of guest sen rice was limited, and Wuhu machine sen rice was only opened at 115 yuan.</p>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice continuously arrived in Shanghai. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived at port on Saturday evening, transporting 9,998 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuesheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (Sunday), also transporting 14,976 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. The foreign rice transported by the two ships was all the Bureau of Public Works' low-priced rice.</p>
<p>Although the supply of thick-grain and thin-grain domestic rice was still limited, as local buyers saw foreign rice declining and weak, their sentiment also slackened. Sales were poor, and the market could not establish a foothold, declining by 1 yuan per shih. The opening price for fresh special early and late rice from Nangan was 137 yuan, and the general market price was 134.5 yuan. Unpackaged old rice from Wuxi fell from a high of 131 yuan to a final price of 126 yuan.</p>
<p>As sales of glutinous rice had fallen, combined with the decline in foreign rice, the market felt even more deserted, and transactions were sparse. Prices followed foreign rice, falling by about 2 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan opened at a high of 120 yuan, ordinary was 118.5 yuan, and the final price was 116 yuan. Glutinous tea was 111 to 104 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice will also be difficult to maintain under these circumstances. The opening prices were 122-123 yuan, medium grade was 120 yuan, and low grade was 118 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flat-Priced Sales to Be Suspended Tomorrow, Flour Market Hovering</h3>
<p>Over 36,000 More Bags of American Flour Arrive Continuously</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot foreign flour market situation continued to hover. In terms of supply, the ship "Taiyuan" transported 33,850 bags of American flour from Hong Kong, mostly Five Swallow brand flour. The goods are being unloaded. Also, the Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuesheng Wheel transported 2,442 bags of flour from Hong Kong, which were also unloaded yesterday. As the bottom of the month was near, rice prices were declining, and confidence was weak. However, as the Huachang flat-priced flour had exhausted its raw materials, it was decided to suspend sales starting on July 2, so the sales on this street were not lonely. The general market price opened at 32.1 yuan for Golden Dragon flour, 32.9 yuan for Battery flour, and 32.8 yuan for Steamship brand. Transactions totaled over 1 yuan per shih. The market situation has not yet escaped the brewing phase. The supply and demand of wheat were both quiet, and there was no regular market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil and Soybeans Have Different Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Cooking Oil: Has recently turned weaker, because actual sales are slow and not smooth. Hoarders are all intending to sell, fearing that more oil will come to Shanghai. The market trend is not likely to improve. Yesterday, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold at a price of 174 yuan. 300 cans of Jiangbei local raw oil were priced at 158 yuan. July delivery of Da You factory clear oil was 116 yuan, and late July delivery was 117 yuan, all showing a decline compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>Soybeans: Have slightly turned for the better. The attitude of cargo owners has gradually changed from selling to holding, so the situation has slightly strengthened. Yesterday, 150 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were purchased from this street at a price of 47.5 yuan. 100 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans were priced at 44 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao soybeans were priced at 43.8 yuan. 35 corner of Guide soybeans 42 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: 100 bags of soybeans were shipped to Amoy, and 130 bags of soybeans, 7,310 pieces of soybean cakes, 130 bags of sesame seeds, and 50 cans of sesame oil were all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Banks Prepare for Semi-Annual Closing, Exchange Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday was flat, and all exchange rates listed by HSBC were flat. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was quite stable, and transactions were very rare, as Chinese and foreign banks are having a two-day holiday starting today for the first half of the year. The market is quiet as banks are winding up their accounts at the end of the first half of the year before the holiday. Only Chinese speculators are still offering August short positions, but Chinese banks are buying little, so the market situation has changed little. In the afternoon, no opening prices were heard and the prices remained fixed. In the end, only British exchange rates were slightly tighter, and American exchange rates were flat.</p>
<p>Speculative Offering of August American Dollars</p>
<p>Since the morning's overseas telegraphic news showed a slight increase in Indian silver in the silver market, the exchange rates for British and American exchange rates were unchanged, and the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the British pound fell by 0.025, while the rest remained unchanged. The centrally listed exchange rates remained flat. The early opening selling prices for banks in the domestic market were 3 pence 3125 for spot British exchange and 5.40625 yuan for American exchange.

<h3>Before Year-End Closing and Holiday: Gold Market Stable, June Contracts Fully Settled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw fluctuating prices in off-hours trading but trended towards stability. Prices hovered around 6,400 yuan. After initial declines, there was a rebound, which instilled confidence among investors and led to reduced trading volume. This was due to the upcoming bank year-end closing and holiday for the first half of the year, which would necessitate a two-day market closure. The morning's opening saw the securities firms and retail investors selling, causing prices to drop to a low of 6,389 yuan. Unexpectedly, Shanghai West banks and remittance houses started buying, with Li Tai actively purchasing. Prices gradually rose to 6,415 yuan by noon. News of an American ship being sunk by the Germans curbed the rise, causing a slight decline. In the afternoon, prices fluctuated around 6,405 yuan, with only a 10-yuan difference, eventually closing up 5 yuan. The total trading volume was light, at 20,000 taels. Closing prices were stable. The remaining 1,605 contracts for June settlement were finalized yesterday at the month's end, using the HSBC small counter's exchange rate of 5.375 for US dollars, resulting in a price of 6,479 yuan and 1 jiao. Both long and short positions were fully settled. Spot prices were stable, with extremely limited trading. Ming Feng sold 30 taels to Tian Yuan at a price 320 yuan higher than the futures price. There were no reported trades in the afternoon, with prices remaining 320 yuan higher, several yuan higher than last Saturday. Prices for ornamental gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Futures Up Only Five Yuan</p>
<p>This morning, each contract (10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM at 6,395 yuan, 9 yuan lower than last Saturday's noon closing price. Retail investors started buying, pushing the price up to 6,400 yuan. Yi Da and Da Feng sold off, gradually dropping the price to 6,389 yuan. Shanghai West banks started buying, causing an immediate rise. Li Tai, Cheng Ji, and Gong Da all bought, pushing the price up to 6,404 yuan. Da Feng and Jin Yuan sold small amounts, lowering the price to 6,395 yuan. Li Tai continued to buy, and Wan Feng and Xiang Xing Yong also bought, lifting the price to 6,415 yuan by noon, as speculators exited positions. Prices then returned to the 6,400 yuan level. The noon closing price was 6,405 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 2:00 PM at 6,404 yuan, 1 yuan lower. Heng Ji bought in, and retail investors pushed the price up to 6,410 yuan.

Prices were constantly pushed up, reaching a noon close of 6,409 yuan, 5 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon close. Using the July US dollar exchange rate of 5.40625, the settlement price was 6,442 yuan, a difference of 33 yuan, with a spread of 26 yuan. The selling price of gold from cash shops was 330 yuan higher than the off-hours futures price, while the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There were no bids or offers for spot gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry at major silver shops like Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang remained at 695 yuan per tael (buying price reduced by 40 yuan).</p>
<h3>Slight Fluctuations in US Dollar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable off-hours prices. There was little fluctuation in British gold pounds or American gold pounds. British gold notes remained steady, with stable market prices. American gold notes opened at 39 cents, then dropped to 37 cents due to selling by Zhi Cheng. Subsequently, due to purchases by Da Gong and Sen Ji, the price rose to 41 cents, closing at 40 cents at noon. In the afternoon, the price rose further to 43 cents at closing, a rise of 7 cents compared to last week. Spot prices were still 27-28 cents lower than futures prices.

<h3>Securities: Banks Closing Accounts, Public Bonds Only Traded Once, Holidays Today and Tomorrow, Stock Market for Various Industries Quite Active</h3>
<p>Due to banks' semi-annual settlements and the holiday today and tomorrow, the public bond market also closed yesterday. Only one transaction was made yesterday. Starting July 3rd, the opening and closing times for the public bond market will be revised to 9:30 AM opening and 10:15 AM closing in the morning, and 2:00 PM opening and 2:30 PM closing in the afternoon. This is due to the hot weather, and the meeting times are temporarily shortened. At the initial market opening yesterday, prices rose slightly due to small purchases by Xin Fu and Lian Yi. Later, due to selling by Yong Chang, De Chang, and Hong Da, Class C bonds, which had just broken through 3 yuan, failed to stabilize and broke through the 3 yuan mark again. During this period of shifting positions, prices could not rise. However, Class A bonds became increasingly disadvantaged, with the difference between them and Class C bonds being only 7 yuan and 4.5 jiao, and the difference widened further. Because there are still 40 days until the lottery draw, short sellers will realize their difficulties and retreat by mid-July. As a result, market prices, except for Class A bonds which were slightly better by 5 fen, were down by 1.5 to 2 jiao. Class C bonds were unchanged. The turnover was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 80.50 | 80.30 | 80.35 | Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified B | 74.35 | 74.00 | 74.35 | Down 0.15</p>
<p>Unified C | 73.30 | 71.85 | 70.90 | Flat</p>
<p>Unified D | -- | -- | -- | --</p>
<p>Unified E | 70.90 | 70.70 | 70.75 | Down 0.20</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Sincere Company were traded at a price of 10 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<p>The stock market for various industries was active throughout the day, with prices rising steadily. Rubber stocks showed a particularly strong trend, likely due to the recent announcement of dividends by various companies, which gave people a good impression.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Both Red and White Sugar Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to tighten, with both red and white sugar seeing improvement. According to Dutch telegrams, August-shipment CIF prices were US$3.75 for Dutch coarse white sugar and US$3.13 for Dutch red sugar. The association's prices for current goods showed 24 coarse white, June new crop, initially at 90 yuan and 6 jiao, then rising to 8 jiao, and further to 1 yuan, up 6 jiao; May imports at 90 yuan, up 7 jiao; April imports at 89 yuan, up 7 jiao; March imports at 88.5 yuan, up 5 jiao.

DY Mark was 96.5 to 97 yuan at the Eastern godown. HX Mark at the Eastern godown rose from 88.5, 7 jiao, and further to 89 to 9.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. CC Mark rock candy was 110 yuan, the factory's No. 1 rock candy was 120 yuan, and Jing Ming rock candy was 120 yuan. 2,600 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Assorted Red Dates from Hangzhou Sell Extremely Well</h3>
<p>Assorted red dates have been out of stock for a long time. It is found that the stock in the market of long red dates and Fu red dates totals about 3,000 packages. Recently, because Hangzhou people went in to purchase in large quantities, almost everything was bought empty, so that the existing stock was exhausted and the price accordingly became tight. For example, Jinan Fu red dates initially sold for 46 yuan, but in less than three days, the price has risen to 52 yuan. Long red dates have also been called up from 30 yuan to 38 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Firm</h3>
<p>The price of honeysuckle at the producing area is not loose, and the foreign exchange rate is high, making it extremely difficult to meet the cost, resulting in the lack of follow-up shipments, so the market in Shanghai is very firm. Yesterday, the market price was 500 yuan for the higher grade and 490 yuan for the next, and it is not easy to loosen.</p>
<h3>Sea-Ear Shells Relax</h3>
<p>Sea-ear shells, that is, abalone shells, have arrived recently in larger quantities, and the de-inventory is sluggish, so the price is loose. It is found that the market price once opened at more than 200 yuan, but now the market price is only about 190 yuan, and the trend is flat and soft.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Merchants Act Perversely, White Coal Still Rising in Price</h3>
<p>After the new goods of Tung Tak Lee white coal arrived at the port last week, the market should have been stable, but the merchants intentionally closed the market and split the price high. In fact, in the hot summer weather, the sales are very slack. Yesterday, the price of No. 123 lump from the car station was 440 yuan per ton, which was 20 yuan higher than the beginning of the month. It is unexpected to act perversely.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric: Recent Situation of Woolen Fabric Industry</h3>
<p>European War Expansion…Supply Interrupted</p>
<p>Shanghai Factory Weaving…Raw Material Expensive and Scarce</p>
<p>Autumn and Winter Clothing…Great Need to Scour</p>
<p>The arrival of woolen fabrics has been extremely difficult recently, because the European war has spread and expanded, the Mediterranean Sea is dangerous, and the number of ships sailing has been reduced by two-thirds compared with before, and many ships have to take long detours, so those who occasionally arrive are often delayed. Looking at the recent situation, the only port for imported woolen fabrics is Shanghai, which is transferred from Hong Kong. 70% of the goods are British goods, and 25% are Japanese goods. Japanese goods will be difficult to transport to Shanghai in the future, and although British goods have settled down, there is no obstacle. It is impossible to judge in advance. As for the production of woolen fabrics in Shanghai factories, the recent natural raw materials are also subject to high prices and difficult sources, and the output has been reduced a lot. In the future, not only will their own spinning businesses have difficulties, but also foreign companies with strong capital such as Jardine Matheson, Wing On, Hong Kong and Shanghai plants will have difficulties. At that time, small factories will have to be forced to suspend operations.</p>
<p>Recently, since the start of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, and the tension between the United States and Japan, the local woolen fabric industry has become firm again, because it is said that the arrival of goods will be even more difficult, and the output of local goods will inevitably be scarce. In the future, the supply of various woolen fabrics will tend to be insufficient, so there is a great need to scour for autumn and winter goods. Yesterday, there were transactions for whatever single-sided flannel, suit flannel robe material flannel, serge Walter flannel, overcoat flannel women's color flannel, camel period brocade riding pants flannel, etc.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Floating Stock Disgorged, Soap Sales Mediocre</h3>
<p>The soap market is trending toward calm. Because real sales have been slack for several days, speculation is on the sidelines, and hoarders' buying has slightly relaxed, so floating stocks have gradually been disgorged. It is estimated that each box of Gu Ben soap is 54 yuan, each box of Bai Mao soap is 43 yuan, and each box of Huang Xiang Mao soap is 42.5 yuan, and there is no honor or disgrace compared with the previous.</p>

<h3>Eliminating Racial Prejudice</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>One of the greatest sins of mankind is narrow-mindedness and deep-rooted racial prejudice. Historically, countless cruel acts have occurred due to the selfishness and intolerance of different races.</p>
<p>These kinds of unreasonable atrocities continue to emerge in totalitarian countries, but in other parts of the world, they are gradually changing. This shows that mankind is truly progressing, most obviously in the United States.</p>
<p>Black people in the United States were originally looked down upon by white people, but two recent facts are enough to show the gradual improvement of the status of black people. The city of Philadelphia in the United States awards a prize of 10,000 yuan every year to the citizen who has made the most contributions to social progress in a year. This year, the prize was awarded to the famous black female singer Anderson. This move has aroused praise from all parties. Not long ago, President Roosevelt instructed the industry to accommodate qualified workers as much as possible, and not to discriminate because of race, original nationality, religion, or skin color. He believed that continuing to discriminate against certain workers was tantamount to promoting the policies of totalitarian countries.</p>
<p>Racial prejudice cannot be completely eliminated overnight, but the awakening of some people in any country is a commendable and gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>A better world should be like a harmonious family, where everyone's status is determined by their beliefs and contributions to social progress, and has nothing to do with race, nationality, religion, or skin color.</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<h3>Animal Air Defense</h3>
<p>— Wu Futong</p>
<p>Animals in Britain also have air defense organizations, which are generally planned according to the people's air defense organizations. Britain has a total of 100 million heads of livestock, which is equal to twice the population. The National Animal Air Defense Committee has now completed a plan, including rescue teams, inspection teams (inspecting whether there are animals locked inside when entering bombed areas), stretcher teams, mobile first-aid medical teams, and a temporary rest center.</p>
<p>The work of caring for animals in the emergency center is mostly done by women. A large number of volunteer animal guards have now been recruited to serve as liaisons between the central districts and animal owners. On each street, the committee appoints an animal guard as much as possible. They do not have to work during the bombing. Once the alarm is lifted, they must immediately look for animals in need of rescue everywhere.</p>
<p>The committee has established a registration system for beloved animals. Each animal has a numbered round tag. Through this method, thousands of animals are often returned to their original owners after the bombing. Colonel Stuart, the organizer of the committee, said: "We have found new homes for 1,000 dogs and 600 cats." Because this plan can enable lost animals to return home, it is also respected by the police. In fact, the six million dogs and cats in Britain are nothing more than a national inspection. Colonel Stuart said that dogs, horses, rabbits, monkeys, and birds have almost no fear of bombs.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of gasoline, there are more horses on the streets of various cities than in previous years. Horse owners are also busy strengthening the defense of garages to serve as temporary animal shelters. Parks, baseball fields, football fields, and other open spaces are equipped with emergency tie-up places for horses. During daylight air raids, horses can be tied to trees or manger iron rings to ensure safety. According to British law, horses have reins, so in the event of an alarm, the horses can be tied up quickly. Except for dogs that guide the blind, cats and dogs are not allowed to enter public air-raid shelters. In some parks in London, they have special equipment. Kensington Park has dog air-raid shelters. Each dog is tied to a grid with a chain, and there is a concrete building to cover it. Hyde Park has iron fences around public air-raid shelters, allowing animals to stay there while their owners are hiding underground.</p>
<p>British farmers are also assisted by the state to protect the 37.5 million heads of livestock and 56 million heads of poultry across the country. This work is carried out by the Ministry of Food and the National Farmers' Association. Mobile veterinary teams and local animal management teams are directed by a manager in a parish. A letter from northern England recently said: "During the bombing and machine gun strafing, animals can easily be driven into safe areas without any deaths or injuries."</p>
<p>During the air raids, several dogs have provided extremely valuable services, and Chim is one of the outstanding ones. He is a 12-year-old dog owned by the Stott couple in Pulborough County, Surrey. When Mrs. Fallon's house collapsed and was buried in the defensive trench, Chim was nearby. He tried his best to dig a hole with his paws, which was the size of Mrs. Fallon's body. He also used his mouth to hold Mrs. Fallon's clothes and helped her climb out of the hole. Like a group of chivalrous heroes, he turned around and left without leaving his name after the person was rescued. He was later traced to Walter Leaf Road in Pulborough before he was found. The Dumb Friends League praised his courage and presented him with a special gold medal.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>10 The Heart of a Loving Father</p>
<p>So Qiu Haitang and his daughter moved to Hengshui County, which is close to Shandong Province.</p>
<p>"Dad, we live very well in Dao'er, why do we have to move to a strange place?" Mei Shi was really reluctant to leave Li's Village, and she asked her father with a very unhappy look on the day she got up.</p>
<p>"Child, let me tell you," Qiu Haitang put her on his lap and said in a very low voice, "Last month, Uncle came home and told me that we have an enemy coming here, so...! Your dad wants to avoid him before he comes."</p>
<p>"Is the enemy a man or a woman?" Mei Bao asked as if she understood.</p>
<p>"It's a woman...! No, it's a man!" Qiu Haitang replied vaguely. But Mei Bao's sharp eyes had already seen two lines of tears hanging down his face.</p>
<p>"Then let's move away quickly!" She kept nodding her little head and said. She couldn't help thinking that her father was so afraid of this enemy that he would cry, so he must be a very powerful enemy who would even eat people!</p>
<p>In fact, what enemies did Qiu Haitang still have? He was afraid that Luo Xiangqi would find him.</p>
<p>"...The bank matter is really impossible. Although the villain has been running day and night, the gate is tightly closed, and it is hateful that no one can be seen. Master Yuan San died in battle in Rehe last week, and Master Qi is also missing, I am afraid he is dead. The Yuan family here is scattered and there is no one to ask for..."</p>
<p>Although the wording of the person who wrote the letter was not fluent and the sentences were really difficult to understand, the general meaning was not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>He knew that Yuan Baofan never brought his family to Chengde. Since Zhao Si said "The Yuan family is scattered," probably all the wives and concubines must have escaped; he was of course very comforted that Xiangqi could regain his freedom, and he had never hoped to reunite with her, but when he thought of his own ugly face and the economic panic caused by the collapse of the bank, his heart was colder than below freezing point.

<h3>Radio-Controlled Steamboat</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>The United States Navy recently invented a radio-controlled steamboat as a target for bombers to practice bombing. The steamboat is 34 feet long and travels 35 miles per hour. There is no need for a driver in the boat. It is controlled by radio in the bomber, so no lives are harmed during bombing practice. In addition, the steamboat is also unsinkable.</p>
<p>When war breaks out in the future, this radio-controlled steamboat may be filled with explosives and sped to the enemy's warship location to replace torpedoes. Because it is radio-controlled, the accuracy is of course more reliable than torpedoes.</p>

<h3>Children's Concert</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>Recently, there will be a very grand children's concert to be performed on the stage of the Joint Stage. In order to understand the content of this conference, the reporter inquired about news from all parties concerned, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Children's Drama Education Society is hosting the children's concert. They have already performed once on the Joint Stage on March 21 this year, and the results were very good. Thousands of children from all over the city actively participated, and they received enthusiastic support from people from all walks of life. This is the second performance.</p>
<p>The performance date is July 3, starting at 9 o'clock in the morning. The ticket prices are divided into two types, one yuan and six jiao. They are sold to various elementary schools in the city. It is said that the income will be used entirely as a fund to create a "Children's Music Hall" in addition to the necessary expenses.</p>
<p>The performance programs include: "The Tempest", "The Call of the Earth", "Defend Great China", "New China March", "No Passing", etc. These are all very meaningful songs of righteousness. There are also the piano performance of the Weifeng Music Hall and the wind music performance of the China Relief Women and Children Association Children's Music Team. The last wonderful program is: a chorus of five hundred children, singing "Let's Sing" and "Our Song".</p>
<p>Now is the beginning of the summer vacation, and their performances will definitely not hinder the children's homework.</p>
<p>We are very willing to let innocent children sing the songs they love to sing, and we are also very willing to let wise parents who have the mission of education listen to the righteous songs of the children.</p>
<h3>Yan Shishan's Thirteenth Sister</h3>
<p>— Lu Yuan Scholar</p>
<p>Yu Yuqin was the first to perform the play "Thirteenth Sister". The successors, male and female, are too numerous to mention. Among those who are more famous, there were Wang Yaoqing in the past and Xun Huisheng in the future. However, they were self-righteous, changed the old rules, and changed the hard qiao to small boots. Their tricks to hide their clumsiness were secretly disapproved by the knowledgeable. The ancients once discussed it. When Yuqin performed this play in those years, she was especially known for her qiao skills. In the original text of the Children's Heroes Biography Yuelaidian, it is said: "The young master (referring to An Ji) quickly retreated two steps, turned around, and wanted to enter the room, but he couldn't help but look back and saw that he was wearing a Yuanqing crepe veil headscarf, two corners, hanging on the side of his ears, two corners covering the swallowtail on the back of his head, wearing a Buddhist blue coarse cloth shirt that was long enough to cover his feet, and the sleeves of a letter were not rolled up, covering his hands, (according to this, the Thirteenth Sister that is performed now, who always wears a red hood and wears red shirt and pants, is inappropriate, but it can only be used in the Nengren Temple) wearing a pair of Erlan pointed toe embroidered broken flower bow shoes under his feet, the size of which is only two inches, less than three inches." It is even more believable that what I said is not wrong, and this is a footnote to the iron plate of qiao stepping in this play. The reason is that Yaoqing is completely unable to perform qiao skills, Huisheng can perform but is not proficient. It is called improvement, but in fact it is simplifying and cutting corners. Today, Shishan is far behind his predecessors, and he is still the same as before, striving to correct Wang Xun, and not following the same path. He can maintain the model of the first righteous in one out of ten thousand. Although it is his debut work, (it is the first performance of Nengren Temple) the singing, speaking, acting, expressions, and body movements are not yet seamless, and everything is in order. However, the scale has been established and the foundation has been laid. Therefore, in the future, with his unique qiao skills, he will be able to improve day by day and dominate the singing world. I express my opinions in the right, because I am happy that he can work hard and strive to be upstream. I will write another poem to give him.</p>
<p>He has inherited Yuqin's old style from afar. He is different from others when he takes the stage. Xun's different schools are difficult to be trained. It is admirable to learn from others and be a hero of the world.</p>
<h3>Strolling Through the Arts Scene</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>The China Experimental Drama Troupe held a symposium on the evening of the 29th at Xia Guang Middle School. In addition to core members of the troupe such as Zhou Yifeng and Chu Qun, film and drama personalities such as Bai Yun, You Guangzhao, Hua Sha, and Chang Yandao also attended, totaling over thirty people. Bai Yun delivered a speech during the meeting: "I hope drama practitioners stand firm in their positions, recognize their goals, and further hope that the drama troupe belongs to the public, and is not a private property." His words were full of encouragement. It is said that the troupe is currently rushing to rehearse "Regeneration Fate."</p>
<p>The performance of "Fengbo Pavilion" by Hua Sheng was banned because the script failed to pass. The reason was that the content was quite passionate and stirring. According to Shu Shi, the estimated loss this time is around ten thousand yuan. After suffering this blow, Hua Sheng will certainly make persistent efforts and strive forward.</p>
<p>The Huaxia Amateur Drama Society, organized by Shanghai university and middle school students, is scheduled to stage Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm" on July 16th. The play is directed by Zhou Chu. Huang He, who played Yue Fei in "Fengbo Pavilion," and Lü Yukun, among others, are also said to be joining as guest actors.</p>
<p>Wei Ruhui is writing "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" for the Shanghai Drama Society, which will be completed in the coming days.</p>
<p>Tianfeng is rehearsing "Grievances in the Qing Palace." To ensure authenticity, they have specially invited someone familiar with Qing court anecdotes to provide on-site guidance. The production cost of this play is substantial, with costumes and props being designed and newly made. Every member is giving their all.</p>
<p>For the popular performances of "Song of Righteousness," all seats are priced at fifty cents. However, attendance is limited to young students, who must present their school badges to enter.</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Drama Society's summer performances were a "Week of Re-staged Famous Plays." This year it has been designated as a "Comedy Festival." The first program is "Gilding" and "The Proposal," the second program is "God, Ghost, and Man," written by Huang Zongjiang, the third program is "Border Town Story," and the fourth program is "Isolated Island Men and Women," written by Gu Zhongyi. "Wu Ren, a collaborator from "Ren Zhi Chu," will be invited to direct this play.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Peony Blossom"</h3>

<p>Quick Sketches of Film Personalities</p>
<h3>Little Douglas Fairbanks</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>Little Douglas Fairbanks appeared on the screen at the age of thirteen. In addition to studying in his hometown of New York, he also studied in London, Paris, and other places, learning painting and sculpture. He has published poetry collections and satirical essay collections, making him a talented figure in the film industry. He married Joan Crawford, but they divorced shortly after. He is now married to Mary Medford. Recently, he was appointed by President Roosevelt to go to South America to connect with cultural circles and develop cultural undertakings, because South Americans admire him very much. This shows that Little Douglas Fairbanks' knowledge and talent are indeed a cut above the rest.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Shi Renwang, a harmonica expert who composes musical scores for this newspaper, has recently established a summer harmonica crash course at the Popular Harmonica Association, located at the east end of Chengdu Road, Baek Road. With his rich experience and the latest teaching methods, Mr. Shi can enable students to master all the elementary and advanced playing techniques and famous songs within two months. It is said that the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic in recent days. (2) A person in charge of the Xingxing Drama Society stated that the society, organized by young people in the education sector who love drama, has moved to the Shangqing Middle School, located at the intersection of Qingdao Road and Meibaige Road, for office purposes. They are currently actively rehearsing "Making Money with a Way," which will be performed in mid-July. However, due to the insufficient number of original actors, they plan to recruit a number of male and female members. Anyone with a junior high school education and a passion for drama should bring two two-inch photos and register with the society. (3) The Silver Song Selection published by Yiyi Company is a purely Western music songbook. The second issue is scheduled to be published on July 6th, containing interludes such as "One Night of Ecstasy" and "Peony Blossom," which are even more exciting than the inaugural issue. It is also reported that the company will broadcast Western music records at the New Glass Radio Station every night from 8:00 PM, starting from July 1st.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Heroic Demeanor Comes to Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Xu Jing also felt that the isolated city was in danger. Wang Yongtai had already sacrificed himself for the country. He and General Zhou did not know what would happen and could only resign themselves to fate. He also thought of Liu Yinying on Weifeng Mountain. This person was a chivalrous youth with much better skills than himself. That day, he playfully took the treasured sword at Wang Yongtai's house, captured the assassin alive, and displayed his skills with ease, earning people's admiration. Although their acquaintance was short, they were new companions, but in their conversations, he knew that he also had a strong patriotic enthusiasm. He had already agreed to go out with him to follow General Zhou to kill the bandits and had also promised General Zhou in person, so he should definitely come. However, when General Zhou's letter arrived, he suddenly made excuses that he had not obtained his aunt's permission and told him to come first. Now that the roving bandits had been attacking the city for many days, he would definitely know, so why was he so late in coming? Yesterday, General Zhou also asked him about it, hoping that he would come to help in the battle. If he does not arrive at this moment, I am afraid he will eventually be disappointed. Then knowing a person's face but not their heart, this person is just outwardly handsome but without righteousness, and is not as straightforward as Zhang Cangqiu and Li Xin. Moreover, his background is also evasive and he refuses to speak directly, which is really unpredictable and cannot be doubted. As Xu Jing thought this, the roving bandits under the city were attacking urgently, and more than a dozen people had climbed up the city wall from the cloud ladders. Xu Jing quickly ran over, holding a gun in his right hand and waving a sword in his left, and beheaded five or six of them. The remaining crowds fled down the city wall. Xu Jing also ordered the soldiers to release more rolling stones, smashing all the cloud ladders one by one. After a period of chaos, things returned to normal. The western gate was attacked with extreme intensity, and General Zhou Yuji defended it with all his might, preventing the roving bandits from entering. At night, they quickly repaired the damaged parts of the city wall. This stalemate continued for seven or eight days, with roving bandits attacking the southwest gates every day. The eastern gate was also sometimes attacked by bandits, and Zhou Yuji ordered Fan Cheng to take care of it carefully. Only the north gate had never been attacked. The terrain there was steep and mountainous, and it was feared that the roving bandits did not attack because it was more difficult to use troops. Therefore, Zhou Yuji relaxed the defense of this route and focused all his efforts on the southwest gates. Unexpectedly, one night at midnight, Xu Jing was patrolling the south gate when he suddenly heard a thunderous roar from the north gate. Several feet of the north gate's city wall suddenly collapsed, and a large group of roving bandits had stormed into the city from outside the north gate (103)—End of Chapter Eleven</p>
