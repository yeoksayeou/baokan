<p>路透社七日紐的電　羅斯福總統將於星期一日午後九時從白宮發表廣播言論、總統秘書哈息　未透露總統此次　論之性質、惟謂其言頗有重大童義、約歷一刻鐘之久、將譯成四種語言、由短波播送世界各處、或問以是吾與格里埃號驅逐艦事件有關、哈息特答稱、準不能言、並謂渠不以爲總統驟然決定於星期一日發言云、</p>
<p>哈瓦期社七日海德公園電　羅斯福總統定明晚發表重要演說、預料將力言美政府決心、使美國輪　駛往冰島、不受任何阻碍、此外、並將涉及遠東問題、</p>
<p>路透社七日紐約電　前共和黨候選總統威爾基、昨在慶祝南國君主彼得誕辰之節目中播音、勸新斯福總統以決心與定力、應付野蠻力量對美國所享海上自由權利之挑戰、謂渠發此言、渠知乃人多數美人所欲言者、渠希望美總統照會德國、告以美國期望其船隻得在北大西洋暢行無擾、苟有阻撓之者、定將受其應得之結果云、</p>
<p>路透社七日紐約電　紐約時報頃詳述格里埃號之意外事件云、德方已明白通告對於駛入其「作戰區域之任何美國艦船、將予轟擊、吾人對此威脅自不能退讓、廢止中立法案各項禁例之時、今已至矣、應武裝吾人之船隻、並在海軍保護之下、完成其指定之使命、</p>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　紐約各報載稱、羅斯福總統決定明日播音之動機、大的係由於驅逐艦格里埃號之被攻、一般人對於羅總統所將發表之言論、紛致推測、</p>
<p>德謂美艦先投炸彈　潛艇放雷係出還擊</p>
<p>海通社七日柏林電　德官方昨夜稱、所謂格里埃號車件、並非德國潛艇襲擊美驅逐艦、而係美驅逐艦在德國封銷區內德國潛艇放深水炸彈、並窮追不捨、該德國潛艇爲實施正當防衛權利起見、乃向該不明國籍之驅逐艦轟擊均未命中、但該驅逐艦乃繼續以深水炸彈追擊德國潛艇、德國官方認爲此决事件足以證明羅斯福已下令攻擊德國一切水上及水底船艇、故意引起糾紛關於此决事件之德國公報稱、一九四一年九月四日十二時三十分、德潛艇一艘在北緯六十二度三十一分與西經廿七度六分之德國封鎖區內、被一驅逐艦施放深水炸彈、並緊追不拾、德潛艇不能辨明該驅逐艦之國籍、爲正當防衛起見、乃於四時三十九分時、向該艦施放雙發魚雷一枚、未曾命中、該驅逐艦仍繼續追擊、至午夜始止、如美國官方若美國海軍部等稱、德國潛艇先向美驅逐艦攻擊、其目的無非欲卸去美艦違反中立攻擊德潛艇之責任耳、此决事件足證實總統已下令美國艦隊、如遇有德國船艇、非但應立即將其所在地報知、並應立即向其射擊、故美總統已在設法激起美國輿論之反德、以便參戰云、</p>
<p>美海軍部發表文告　駁斥德方聲辯言論</p>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　海軍發表文告如下、今日各報雖載有德方聲辯、謂美驅逐艦格里埃號首向潛艇開火云、實則此事之眞象確如海部所發表、係先由潛艇向格里埃號進攻、然後始予還擊也、</p>
<p>合衆社七日華盛頓電　大西洋艦隊昨奉命以飛機及軍艦搜索三度襲擊、格里埃號潛艇、加以「消滅」、德國指責格里埃號首先襲擊該潛艇、因此德方始予以還擊、海軍部乃重申其原來聲明稱、未發警告之魚雷、係先向格里埃襲擊、然後該驅逐艦始以深水炸彈還擊、白宮秘書哈息特在海德公園稱、德方所指責格里埃號嘗先向該潛艇襲擊、殊無加以評論之必要、一思此項指責之來源可知也、海軍部並無它塲之批評、惟某官方發言人則對原來之布告提出注意、柏林之聲明證實該濟艇爲德國者、並指稱格里埃號及其他美國驅逐艦不能「消滅」該潛艇、衆認爲搜索方在繼續中，</p>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　此間官塲指德方所稱美驅逐艦格里埃號有意開釁之說、絕不可信、參外委會主席康納立發表意見、謂德國應知、美國將保衛其船隻與人民、德方今承認此决事件牽涉德潛艇、是不啻承認此潛艇奉德政府命令、向美驅逐艦森擊、此種暗殺精神、絕不顧及他國權利者、已使美國加入上决戰局、吾人固不欲參加目前戰爭、但若吾人船隻或人民遭人攻擊、則吾人定保衛之云、康納立指柏林文告、不過欲使人發生德潛艇未被擊沉之印象而已、</p>
<p>合衆社七日冰島首邑電　格里埃號之船員咋日宜稱、上星期四襲擊天國驅逐艦之德潛艇、於深水炸彈施放時已被擊沈、此等並非不可能、柏林及華盛頓之消息則謂、該潛艇尚安全云、</p>
<p>高橋評論美德問題　認美國將提早參戰</p>
<p>合衆社七日東京電　日前任聯合艦隊司令之高橋大將告「讀賣　聞」云、美國參加歐戰、僅爲時間問題、又稱、格里埃號事件、已將參戰之時間提早、高橋大將稱、美國是吾將竟行對德宣戰、雖小可知、惟此項事件如再繼續發生、則大有引起不宜而戰之可能、又言、德國缺乏艦隊、當無從對美作大規模之決定戰、惟德國將採用潛艇戰術、而收得成效、又稱、德國當然希望美國採取公開戰事、俾德國亦可公開對商輪及戰艦小分玉石、於發現時、一致擊沉、高橋云、美國現時最憂慮者、　爲對日關係及其太平洋軍略、太平洋如有戰事發生、美國在兩洋作戰、至爲小和、惟高橋復承認、美國大西洋艦隊及英國艦隊、力足以應付德國而有餘、美國自可抽調其餘艦隊、在太平洋作戰云、</p>
<p>合衆社七日電　日文報紙本日皆顯著刊載、美驅遂艦格里埃號被襲消息、大多數指責美艦受此種襲擊、日日新聞星期刊稱、此種襲擊實可預期、因中立法已被廢止、蓋租借法案已使中立法中之現金購買及自已運送之條款失效也、該報指出、無論有何種藉口、以再加修改、但援助英國之船隻損失、將有使中立完全取消之效果、報知新聞稱、美國之佔領冰島、實際即等於取消中立、而格里埃號事件、實等於一交戰國之戰艦在戰區內被襲擊、該報稱、格里埃號事件之發生、實由於美國之一方面宣稱、同時又堅持有交戰國之權利、但該報指出、須謹愼防止太平洋有發生此種事件之可能云、</p>
<h3 id="c2">日方仍集中注意　靜待美總統覆文　美民意多主對日作戰 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>路透社七日東京電　東京人士現仍集中注意、以待羅斯福總統致近衛之覆文、因此覆文可表示刻在華盛頓進行中之談判性質也、官塲對於美、日談話、咸緘默無言、謂近衛致美總統之秘翰、內容如何、僅近衛與其左右知之、星期五日美國務卿赫爾所稱、美總統覆文不久當可發出、此爲當然之事一節、此間各報昨皆以大字刋載之、無論如何、負責觀察家皆謂、本月內或今後數日內、定有切實發展、少數樂觀者以爲、目前之悲觀、殆爲烟幕、以掩蔽時事之眞正趨向、蓋日本備有甚多船隻、可供利用、此點至少可爲妥洽的基礎之一也、惟悲觀者則謂、日本旣不能以榮譽方式改變其已採之步驟、而美國又不能贊同日本所已採之步驟、是以根本上解決乃不可能事、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社六日東電　關於美輪載運飛機用汽油駛抵海參崴一項消息、日方新聞檢查員禁止各報登戰、據此間可靠方面消息、美、日談判之獲有若干進展、益證明日本不欲阻撓美國接濟品經由日本領海運蘇、以免引起足以妨碍雙方修好之任何事故、惟日政府仍維持其上月中旬所決定之政策、即日本採行妥協態度、但以美、蘇在外交上有所讓步爲交換條件、美油經海參崴運蘇問題、或已在華盛頓與美、日間全盤問題一併加以討論、亦未可知云、</p>
<p>路透社七日紐約電　迦勒勃社舉行民意測騐、其所詢之問題爲「汝以爲美國現應設法使日本不能更臻强暴、雖冒對日作戰之危險、亦當爲之乎」、今調查竣事、結果投票以爲然者、佔百分之七十、不以爲然者、佔百分之十八、不置可吾者百分之十二、</p>
<p>合衆社七日華盛頓電　國務院昨日正式吾認阿根廷京城傳來之電訊、謂美國已請求阿根廷於一旦發生戰事時、在東京作美國外交上之代表、國務院稱、此種傳聞殊無根據、因美、日關係顯然木嘗瀕於破裂也、</p>

<h3 id="c7">格里埃事件與美日談話 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>太平洋局勢至今無所進展，大西洋又因美驅逐艦格里埃號被轟擊發生了軒然大波。連日美方輿情已極見激昂、而德政府竟悍然以此自承，並以該艦駛人德國封鎖區爲施以轟擊的理由，該艦雖然未遭損害，但此一問題之嚴重性質，已顯非羅賓摩爾號或圖拉號事件所能比擬。</p>
<p>五月間羅賓摩爾號之被德艇擊沉，當時世人多以爲意在迫使美國參戰，在事後看來，其眞實用意無寗到更在於試探美方反應的程度，藉以判斷美國會不會在侵蘇戰事爆發時牽制德國，正有如「七七」事變前日軍之在黑龍江擊沉蘇力兩艘砲艦一樣。蘇德戰事爆發後，國際形勢一變，無論交戰國或非交戰國　都處在一種牽一髮則動全身的微妙狀態之下。以全力攻蘇的德國，兩個半月以來，迄未獲有決定性的勝利，其切望在世界其他角落間發生對德有利的變化自不待言。假使美德而以兵戎相見、日本在法理上有赴援的義務，以利害言是擴展的良機，事實所趨　勢必要與德國密切結託並互相援助。德方此决有意對美爆發格里埃號的嚴重糾紛，大槪就正是這等的存心。</p>
<p>德方所藉口的美艦駛入封鎖區的理由，顯然絕非美當局所能接受，而且也正與美國主張海上自由的傳統政策相悖謬。現在美國大西洋艦隊所屬各艦艇已奉令搜索肇事的德潛艇加以毀滅，美方上下的反響當較六月間之於羅賓摩爾事件更爲重大。至於其對於此一事件如何決定或報復，則今晚羅斯福總統將要發表「意義重大」的演說，即使該演說並非爲此一臨時事件而發，甚且也未必一定明言此事，但此一問題的發生無疑當已深刻影響到美政府的精神與政策，其前途之何去何從，是小難從今晚演說中窺見端倪的</p>
<p>如果德方此决用意確如上面所指出，是着眼在美日關係的未來發展，則目前有關太平洋的形勢也許就正是決定未來國際大局最重要的因素。關於美日談話進行的情形，邇來傳聞互異，美當局始終聲言談話無所進展，來自東京的消息則謂談判進行頗爲順利、在這等撲朔迷離的形態之中，自難辨明事實的眞相。但是所可斷言者：談判已陷停頓之說，尚屬言之過早，進行順利之言也未免含有聊以自慰的意味。日方所望僅在經濟壓力的减輕，美方目標則在於政治癥結的澈底淸算，雙方出發點旣顯有不同，談話立塲亦富逈異，更何况日方根本用意也許只在藉此拖延時日，並小想也無從使此一問題獲得根本解決。不過在事實上儘管有此等隔閡存在，却始終並未堵塞進行談判的通路，近衛函件的送達羅斯福總統，美國油船的陸續安抵海參崴，都可看出日本極端份子　咆哮不耐並不能在日當局的現行政策上有所影響，美政府儘管一再聲明遠東政策不變並保證不再對日綏靖，也迄未放棄外交途徑上的嘗試。但是這一雙方相持不決的局勢極爲脆弱，任何國際間有關的變動都足以使其發生偏犄，格里埃事件的爆發。大槪也就正是納粹覷定此種形勢而佈置的一着。美日談話的進行，即使實際上毫無效果可言，在德國看來總是自身的危。假如美日間眞成立了妥協，不管日本肯不肯退出軸心，多少總要犧牲德國的利益，而且美國在太平洋的安全獲得保障之後，必更要增强進攻納粹的力量。以此寗自甘冒促美參戰的危險，在美德間爆發糾紛，藉以間接助長日本氣焰，使美日間妥協企圖歸於失敗。就納粹此際處境而言；只有使美國長此在太平洋大西洋雙方威脅之下，甚至不能不兩面應戰，纔是對德最有利的理想境界。</p>
<p>目前這一情勢，誠足使美國感到應付的困難，但歐局有英蘇力足支撑，納粹的海上實力應付英國且感不足，遠東有ABCD的堅强陣綫，以言應變，亦綽有餘裕。實際上美方並沒有感到焦慮的必要。目前大西洋方面固因德潛艇活動而又見緊張，國際大局的中心卻仍在太平洋；假使遠東得獲澈底澄淸，歐局的解決亦當减少重大牽制與困難。美日間的談判徒然費時害事，無所裨益，此决納粹之乘此時機威脅美國，正是美方所當注意的一個嚴重敎訓。</p>

<p>關於禁止進口對上海商品市塲之影響，已詳前期拙著。現在可觀察對本市金融市塲的影響？這可分從所禁各項物品的來源上說起：此等被禁進口之物品，大都屬於日本•朝鮮·臺灣·乃至東北各關的出口。如絲及人造絲之織物，呢絨及共製品•海產品•水菓。乾菓·糖菓·食糖用糖·洋酒•飲料•烟草·紙張皮毛骨角•木材竹蓆類·磁器·玻璃器·樂器·玩具•化妝用具·傘等等。此等物品之被禁進口，在中國則適足以調整國際收支，適足以促進國產產業，適足以改善民風而恢復其儉樸之美德；在日本，則將使共出口產業感受影響。此即禁止進口政策中具有經濟戰爭之作用也。口貿易政策最應注意者，不在被禁物品市塲今後之供需，而在厲行禁正進口辦法後之滙兌市塲所能發生之影響。因滙兌市塲之變動，即整個物價市場之變動。整個物價市上之變動，足以阻碍國家之財政令融，足以搗亂整個之國民經濟的安全者也、</p>
<p>經平準會特准辦理今後滙兌供需事宜之九家銀行，假定今後確能對於此項禁止進口物品之滙票需要，絕對拒絕供給。則我國合法之對外滙兌市塲方面，耶無形中减少此等進口需要之負担，如民廿七年時之達二萬三千餘萬元之鉅。亦即供給方面，在無形中增加二萬三千餘萬元之外滙資力。此於穩定匯市一點言，已可知共絕對有利。</p>
<p>禁進與黑匯市場　王海波</p>
<p>然曠觀當前我國進出口岸及其海關，什九皆在日軍佔領區內。因之希望各地海關執行此項禁令，杜絕此項禁運物品之進口，恐有所不能。若外滙管理奏效，黑滙市塲確實消滅，則縱有唯利是圖之商人企圖繼續其此項物品之進口，亦將因進口外滙之不得而無從達到其目的。但佔領區之土貨出口，什丸在日人之手。日商此時亦不難以輸出中國之土產，而換取此等禁止進口之舶來品來華銷售。此等商品市塲，正受禁止進口影響而在投機者抬價中，是則日商經營於此者，將獲更距之漁利。此猶爲一般人認爲今决禁止進口貿易政策之前途所憂者也。</p>
<p>此項顧慮，果合情理。但吾人認爲對於今决推行禁止進</p>
<p>假定除平準會之合法供給的匯兌市塲之外，尚有非法的黑滙市塲之存在。則此等禁止進口的匯票需要，勢將羣趨於此黑滙市塲。於是黑滙市塲之滙率，定較平準會下之合法供給市塲率更形低落。假定此時之所有合法進口，大部份雖已經平準會下之合法供給市塲予以滿足，但小部份不獲核准供給者亦有改趨於此項黑滙市塲之可能。因之黑滙市塲上所遭之壓力，雖已較過去爲輕，但仍不失爲重大。結果所致，黑滙市塲之低降匯率的維持，仍極困難。此則又爲一般人對於滙市前途尚存憂慮之處。但此項憂慮，仍不脫只知其一，不知其二之窠臼。試分析言之。</p>
<p>（一）假定黑匯市塲仍可存在，黑匯率且必較合法市塲之供給匯率爲低。則凡屬平準會勢力所不及之出口匯票，勢必仍趨黑匯市塲，而形成黑匯市塲上之供給來源。而原由黑匯市塲担任供給之所有進。需要，今後旣分共大部份由合法市塲供給；就黑匯市塲而言，不啻已减輕其負担。故黑匯市塲匯率之維持，事實上或校合法供給之市塲猶有可能。</p>
<p>（二）假定凡由合法供給之進口貨價，今後確能依其所結應進匯票之貨架，必較前者昂貴，於其銷售市場將大受打擊。職是之故，足使進口商對於合法進口貿易，寗待合法匯市之供給而不向黑市場染指。則黑匯市場之壓力，當可益減。然若由合法匯市場結匯之進日貨價，不予管理；則難保其不按黑匯市場結匯之進口貨價同等售出；此於合法供給匯兌一穩定物價之效用，即無形消失。</p>
<p>基此兩點觀之，黑滙市塲之滙率，事實上仍有其自然維持之可你。所成問題者，倒在於合法供給之市塲。一因出口滙票資源之將爲黑滙市塲所褻刮以去，使合法供給市塲陷於有供無人之困局。一因有黑滙滙率形成之昂貴的進口物價，足以誘致合法滙率形成之較廉的進口物價之非法的抬高，從而使匯兌管理之意義消失。欲解決此兩大缺點，則黑匯市場之消滅，實屬不可少之條件。</p>
<p>其實欲消減上海之黑匯市場，只須美英貫徹其凍結中國資金之法令巳足。即今後凡非平準會下各指定銀行所供給之外滙，一槪吾定其法律上的保障與效力。是則一切匯票之供給權，乃得絕對的集中於平準會勢力之下。從而一切出口匯票之出售可能，拾平準會勢力下之匯市即無其他。於是黑匯市塲不消而自減無疑。不急不需乃至奢侈物品之進口禁止，亦得以完全禁絕。</p>
<h3 id="c29">貿易與貨幣 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 朱如甫</p>
<p>不能不注意的問題</p>
<p>法幣問題，雖則依然是街談巷議中最關切的問題，但提出來公開討論的，最近幾個月來幾小一見。這種沉默，只會使各方對這問題的認識更混亂；只會增加這問題的決定者之意見更偏狹更固執；然而這決不是一件值得慶幸的事。</p>
<p>一國的貨幣問題，豈僅關係整個國民經濟的榮枯，凡與此有貿易關係的他國經濟，也切切相關。所以任何一國的貨幣變動，除了當事國人民及其經濟首當共衝外，共他貿易關係國也莫不感受影響。而且道種影響，以貿易關係越深者越大。在國際貿易對戰爭經濟頗具決定作用的這决中日戰爭中，貨幣問題的複雜性，原非意外。</p>
<p>美國凍結中日資金雖不澈底，但畢竟已使以法幣爲中心的貨幣戰爭，跨進一個具有決定性的新時代。正因凍結辦法不澈底，所以牠的伸縮力也就特别大。這個時代，可以說是靜待理智恢復的嚴重關頭。</p>
<p>日圓的貿易地位</p>
<p>中國的戰爭經濟中貨幣地位的重要性，比較的小於日本。目前日本尚能向民主國家方面維持相當的貿易關係，完全靠着民主國家自由經濟制度中個人的利潤追求慾點。利潤用貨幣來做尺度，日本幣制一混亂，對外貿易關係就無法維持。如果英美嚴厲執行資金凍結令的話，那末英美商人不復有追求利潤的可能，而且可使日圓在國際匯兌市塲上完全不復有立足的可能：這時日本對外貿易的最後一點維持力也將消失，除非用他的武力來控制他所需要的海外市塲，但這希望是很少的。</p>
<p>至於中國那就不同。中國對外貿易不僅建築於個人經濟的利潤慾求，同時又建築在關係國雙方政治上的需要。因之中國貨幣在國際匯市上旣有友誼的同盟者，同時在國際商品市塲上叉有互通有無的政治需要。換言之：中國的對外貿易，靠着雙方的個人經濟慾求外，又有雙方的國家全體欲求爲其背景。而日本則衹有前面一點。所以太平洋大戰一日發生，日圓的對外貿易可能，將限於極小區域；法幣對外貿易上的地位則仍無變化。航運條件，在中國的今後對外貿易上雖居絕對重要的地位，在日本則問題較小。但在政治上的大前提之下，情勢也將和現狀相反。像美國在蘇德戰爭中因與蘇聯的利害一致，所以除了提供汽油給蘇聯外，還不辭一切危險，供給八千四百二十八噸的聯合號油船，駛往海參崴。日本雖擁有若干海洋運輸船，但像美國此决宣佈凍結日資那天，日本貨船龍田丸雖已駛近舊金山，仍不得不折而他往，漂泊於洋面數日之久，而不敢</p>
<p>這是中日二國的對外貿易可能，在今後太平洋大戰中的絕對不同的兩大基本情勢。同時也足以反映法幣和日圓在今後太平洋大戰中所有命運的不同。一種貨幣而不能在國際貿易上盡其媒介的能事，那就根本失去其貨幣的價值。</p>
<p>法幣的貿易地位</p>
<p>在未來的太平洋戰爭中，日圓將被迫退出對外貿易中的媒介地位；法幣的地位，則依然不變。日文的上海每日新聞在美國宣佈凍結中日資金後會發表過一篇文章，大意說：如果太平洋戰爭一起，上海將和歐戰中的瑞士一般，變成軸心和民主雙方的物資交換中心區，那時上海的市面，非特不致衰落，而且反要繁榮，這種繁榮的維持力，由於法幣的從中撮合。因爲到那時祇有法幣具有國際上的通貨資格，所以法幣的價值，非特不會降低，且將益益增加。這種觀測的是非，固以貨船在那時能吾再駛上海爲斷？但如果貿船尚能繼續來，那末國際貿易上的媒介，無疑地只有法幣堪以勝任。換過來說：假使法幣在上海停止其關於國際貿易上的媒介機能時那末上海的對外貿易定將一落千丈；即使太平洋上尚無戰爭發生時，恐也不能有挽回的辦法。</p>
<p>中國目前爲杜絕日方利用法幣以套購外滙計，正在上海推行貿易管理制度。由平準會辦理上海所有外滙的供應事宜，而以合乎中國戰時經濟上有利的禁進與准進的那些貿易管理條例做外滙供給與吾的標準，因之法幣購買外滙的自由機能，業已受到限制。於是持有法幣的人，正像美國國內持有英鎊的人，雖則他不能將英鎊自由向海外購貨，但是他所有的英鎊之國際價值，無所損失。反因貿易一經管理，國際收支可以調整；匯兌統制發生的效果，貨幣的滙價便可相當穩定。顯然地，這是使法幣主人的財富，從此更有保證。</p>
<h3 id="c30">上海貿易的展望　John　Ahlers <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 著　蘇儒譯</p>
<p>將要來臨的秋季，遠東的經濟和金融遭遇到的多難題。日本是吾將冒險與英美公開戰而去嘗試佔領另一個領土？如果不，她將吾繼續去觸怒和威脅民主國家，寗冒經濟上和金融上史大的報復的危險如民主陣綫對日本勢力範圍內的一切地方，禁止所有經濟往來？如果這種情形都不實現，那末未來遠東怎樣和世界各地繼續進行貿易？非常嚴重的食料問題又將如何？</p>
<p>常常有些—即使現在仍舊有上海的大商人中之幻想者，他們希望美日開戰時，上海的商業仍能照常進行。他們相信上海日僑的財產是這樣的巨大，可以成爲對於軍事行動的一種限制。他們引用有名的日本商人曾說的：「日本絕不需要「另一個閘北，只有斷垣殘壁。」但是，懷抱這種希望的人，他們忽視了一點，即太平洋戰爭如果爆發，將使上海和英美勢力範圍隔絕起來；日本人便將因此失去所有的利益，這種利　曾保持日人中有力的一派，他們樂於維持這個城市的國際貿易，正如現在的半係一樣。</p>
<p>以爲儘管太平洋上日木和英美的海空軍在交戰，而上海的英美僑民仍舊允許居留此地，而且在日本人的鼻息之下進行日常貿易，那完全是一種狂想。日本和英美的開戰，其結果無疑的是在日本勢力範圍內—上海包括在內—所有敵產和商業的立即佔取和淸算。公開的戰爭，將使在日本掌握中的民主國僑民終止他們關於經濟和金融上一切的企劃。因爲他們將沒有東西，亦沒有人再去做生意。他們很可能將在日本的集中營裏。這是無庸再有什褻懷疑的。</p>
<p>要是日本和英美之間的公開戰爭，最近不致爆發，那末在本埠或在日本勢力下的其他各地，西人的商業仍有趨於「麻木」的可能。民主國家對於日本的報復，如果不是公開一戰，便是出之於經濟和金融的戰爭。在這一方面，民主國家的能力和機會尚未完全枯竭。雖然對付日本的凍結和統制貿易已經完成，執照制度的貿易在此種不過形式上禁止的策略下，仍舊允許維持英美荷印和遠東軸心區域實際上的貿易。</p>
<p>然而這種執照制度的貿易的繼續，並非根據任何條的或協定而得到，亦不是有外交上的担保。如果日本再一誤再誤，那末這種執照制度底貿易可以隨時中止，在情勢還未演到公開戰爭之前，可能到達一個中間階段，即澈底斷絕所有和日本的經濟關係。</p>
<p>只有如果日本開始行動得比過去稍爲合理些，英美和荷印才有機會在現行的凍結和禁運條例下採取若干步驟，許可有限地繼續和日本勢力範圍內各地繼續貿易。但是即使是這種辦法亦會覺得非常困難。民主國家和日本對於這個貿易的意見根本是兩樣的。明顯地，前者不欲以可以用於作戰和幫助日本完成軍備的貨物供給日本。而日本的意思則同樣明白地是想拿更多的日本占領區的輸出來換取戰爭的用品。這兩個完全相反的觀念幾乎是衝突的；如果能有若干點的同意，則對於雙方的不能同時滿足，可能使貿易縮小至比現在希望更小的程度，在新的凍結和禁運之下。</p>
<p>遠東在最近若干星期內的氣候狀况，將決定未來數月內遠東的貿易。現在食料在遠東貿易構成上，已成爲最最重要的商品。在一九四一—四二年中，米糧進出口狀况對於其他各方面的貿易都有極大的影響。一年中此時的氣候狀况，對於五穀的收成有決定性的作用，特別是米的收獲量，這與日本，朝鮮，華中，華南和法屬印度支那各地的經濟都極重要。</p>
<p>日本官方預期今年的米產量較去年减百分之五，朝鮮則正常，但現在無論如何是太早去斷定最後的收獲。最近的颱風曾使日本農作物大受損害，這是政府中收獲預測者所不及料的。要是日本和朝鮮短收一，五〇〇，〇〇〇噸的米，東京將繼續向揚子流域和越南去要米的供給；在另一方面，如果日本需要進口的米糧减少，則遠東各地將立刻覺得日本對於米糧的制壓的减輕。日本的收成如能滿意些，日本統制下的人民便能多吃一點比較便宜的食品，東京的分配制度亦可稍弛，航行的困難亦略可救濟。</p>
<p>遝貨船隻的充分供給，亦是遠東一個極大的問題。經美國來往的船隻的的束逐漸增加，但在最近，這不過有時躭擱了貨運的時間，並沒有使貨遝的數量减小。在另一方面，這裏經印度來的棉和煤的貨運在過去數月中减少極多，有時則暫中斷。</p>
<p>從第一决世界大戰以還，遠東海上航運沒有比現在更依賴於日本了；日本的商運隨海軍動員船隻作爲軍用而减少其噸位。現在，大的有三分之一日本的商務船舶，在中國和越南載述軍用物品。英國經遠東撤退商輪在繼續着，美國的航運則僅在南方擴展至新加坡和荷印。對上海方面美國的及早中止航運似亦非不可能。</p>
<p>一般的展望，自然並不能使人沒有疑慮。日本和英美在經濟上的公開戰爭或者可以避免。經濟和金融上的許多問題可以用經濟和金融上的方法去解決；但是即使是最好的解決方法終將無效，如果東京的好戰者佔了上風的話。（譯自The　ChineWeekly　Review,Ang.23）</p>

<p>外籍經濟專家阿勒斯、昨發表「德蘇戰爭與上海貿易」一文、茲迻譯於後、「自德蘇戰事消息傳至上海後、一般人當然認爲遠東對德貿易、從此告終、因此本埠貿易之另一鉅大部份、叉不得不陷於停頓、惟上海貿易所受損害程度若何、則非即可時所能知悉、蓋因本埠經由大連及西伯利亞輸德貨物之數量與價值、來向無明確之統計也、今海關旣已發表七月份國外貿易報告、吾人不妨對此問題、試作檢討、</p>
<p>滬貨運德　向經大連</p>
<p>當歐戰進入第二年之際，全能國家通過西伯利亞之貿易逐漸膨脹結果、上海輸入大連之貨物大爲增加、同時大連成爲德國與遠東貿易之轉運港、但同時日本之關東租借地及東北方面、對滬進口貨數量隨之增加、故上海到大連輸出增加之貨物、究有多少輸入德國、多少留存於日本控制區域、自屬錯綜紛亂、不可究詰、此種混亂情形、使日方史易吾認有大量商品、經由大連運往德國、</p>
<p>德蘇戰後　流至他處</p>
<p>將六月份及七月份上海對大連輸出作一比較、或能對此問題、獲有新的解釋、自六月杪德蘇戰爭爆發後、自滬運往大連經由西伯利亞輸入德國之貨物、即告停滯、但另一方面、以關東租借地及東北爲目的地之貨物、仍照常裝運、故謂七月份上海輸入大連之貨物、較諸上月即六月份輸入者大爲减少、係由於對德輪出流　他　所致、似非不合理、實則此項减少之各類物品出口貿易、似足以表示截至六月爲止、上海經大連輸入德國貨物之大槪數值、</p>
<p>最近兩月　降落甚鉅</p>
<p>七月份上海對大連輸出、與六月份相較、降落甚鉅、據正式估計六月份此項出口貨值、不下三五·四〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、幾佔上海出口總值百分之二十、但七月份出口貨值、佔計僅一六·一〇二·五〇三元、佔本埠出口總值不足百分之九、是七月份此項出口貨值、較前降落一九·三〇〇·〇〇〇兀、在七月份上海出口减少總值內、十足佔去三分之二、</p>
<p>麵粉與油　反見增加</p>
<p>又查七月份上海輸入大連之麵粉、計三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、植物油計二·五·〇〇·〇〇〇元、此兩項數值、不但不較六月份减少、且略有增加、殊堪玩味、就此兩項商品而言、大連顯然並未被作爲德國之轉口港、祇因去年東北各地歉收、故不得不輸入麵粉及食油、以供其用、但七月份上海輸入大連之共他貨物、其數值大抵較前銳减、</p>
<p>德國顏料　蠭湧運滬</p>
<p>但另一方面、七月份德國對滬輸入並未减少、反有激增、此因德蘇戰事爆發時、取道西伯利亞轉運之大批德國貨物、早已二度越過蘇聯邊境、而由日本控制區域繼續載運來滬、故七月份輸滬之德國顏料、較六月份之七一六·〇〇〇元、激增至一·一四二·〇〇〇元、佔本埠顏料進口總值百分之七十、同時、輸入本埠之德國化學物品及藥品、自一六二·〇〇〇元、增至四二九·〇〇〇元、但此類德國貨品之增加、其未來狀况、尚無法臆斷、</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>衣食住行周刊，自與讀者相見以來，已有了三年的歷史，對於道人生四大要件，總算已有了一些小小的貢獻；如今却要和讀者告別了。並不是說我們受了衣食住行嚴重的威脅，從此就可以不衣不食，不住不行，做一個地上的神仙；却爲的在目前這個大時代中，人生經緯萬端，斷不能單單顧全了個人的衣食住行，就可解決一切。由個人擴而大之，那就是家庭；家庭的範圍較大，所可討論和研究的問題也較多而較爲繁複，所以從今天起，就將衣食住行的周刋改爲家庭周刊。想起了古人家齊而後國治的名言，那麼這家庭周刊的出世，似乎不能說是無意義的吧。</p>
<p>一般人對於家庭，各有各的見解，有人以為家庭是一個重累，也有人以為結婚是愚笨的舉動，更有人以為家庭裏的事情，有什麼可以討論，因此許多人對於家庭的組織和處理方法，就不去研究，更談不到改良。然而不說固有的家庭組織，單瞧結爲夫婦的靑年男女，一天天在增多，他們不知道什麼是結婚生活，什麼是家庭經濟，憑着各人有限的智識，隨意處理，要得到美滿的效果，豈不困難！</p>
<p>我們不必談到家庭對於社會組織終究是不是必要的問題。旣然每一個人都有一個家庭，如果我們能够從討論而改良，積極地說，可以使家庭組織更爲健全，社會秩序，更爲整齊。消極地說，可以使家庭開支，因爲有計劃的消耗而大爲减省，家庭生活，因爲夫婦之間履行忠誠坦白的互愛條件而免除無謂的糾紛，所以家庭問題是值得討論，家庭的處理方法，是值得研究的。</p>
<p>然而這並不是一件輕易見效的事情，必須有相當的時間和不斷的努力。今後本刊的登載的文字，當以實用為主，興趣為副而以使一般家庭能夠過著合理化的生活，作為一個大前提。我們在深信讀者努力這個工作，不時貢獻意見孤合作條件之下，一定可以有相當的成就的。</p>

<h3 id="c72">中國家庭的大問題——育嬰 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 陳科美</p>
<p>談到中國家庭的改良，問題實在太多，這是任何社會變動時必然的現象；尤其是道個歷史悠久的古國，有着幾千年不變的家庭制度，又遇着亘古未有的世界大變——歐風東漸，簡直是焦頭爛額，甚麼都是問題。所以要討論中國的家庭問題，眞是千頭萬緒「談何容易」。此處先提到一個最大而又最重要的問題，請大家注意，這個問題就是養育小孩的問題。</p>
<p>育嬰的重要在中國似乎是用不着提；因爲中國一向就很講子孫主義，看重小孩，重視「香烟」，所謂「不孝有三，無後爲大」；但是：很奇怪的，中國人只要有小孩，並不要有健全活潑的小孩；只要小孩多，並不要小孩好；只重量，而不重質。道種態度好像下等的生物，多生可以多活，也就是預備多死；所以「虱婆虱婆，三天做外婆。」但是宇宙間最浪費的事莫過於此；下等生物之所以永爲下等生物，也就在此種完全盲目的浪費。不過下等生物的生命簡單得多，生殖和養育也容易得多，它們受得起此種浪費；而人類的生命如此的複雜，生育如此的艱難，養育又如此的費錢費力，實在受不起此種浪費。所以中國人此種重量不重質的熊度是十分錯誤的，是應立即改良的；否則不僅我們兒童的壽命會像朝生暮死的蟪蛄，他們的生活會像蠢笨汚穢的鹿豕。這就個人言，生活有何價值？人生有何趣味？若就民族言，此種生命短促和材質愚笨的人民有何競爭的能力？有何生存的可能？即勉強生存，亦不過供他人的驅策，作他人的牛馬而已。</p>
<p>所以育嬰的重要，小而言之，關係個人的幸福；大而言之，關係民族的生存；若從家庭來說，則育嬰須在家庭中進行；故家庭實負個人幸福和民族生存的雙重實任；故家庭問題未有如育嬰之重大者。</p>

<p>— 萬秋紅</p>
<p>在秋季的開始，一般的家庭，就耍想到窗飾問題，因爲在今後的幾個月中，關着窗子的時候比較多，因此就耍想怎樣在玻璃上放上一點裝前品。</p>
<p>製作窗帘的方法很多，像圖中左端上面的一種式樣是很普通的，適用於長窗子。即使是較短一些的窗子，也可以利用這一種式樣，只耍窗子的形式是長方形的。</p>
<p>第二種和第一三種方法，是比較新頴的，左端的一種可以使狹而長的窗子顯得寬大一些，下面的一種，可以使低而矮的窗子，顯得寬大一些。至於應用的材料，可以隨着自己的心意布，綢，紗，都可以，顏色方面，最好和墻壁或傢具的顏色相和諧。</p>

<p>— 隱名老人</p>
<p>隱名老人，別署「一世可憐人」。本報發起助學金運動，承老人熱烈贊助，爲本報資助中小各級學生五十人學費，計二千元之鉅，其古道熱腸，足爲楷模。此公復自承年近耳順，景入桑楡，小本經商，能力薄弱，願效棉薄，以作涓滴之助；如下學期尙在人世，營業不致驟變，仍當繼續飲助云。（原函見八月十日本報），茲獲老人手蹟，不營至寳，亟爲刊出，願與社會苦學諸君共勉之。（編者識）</p>
<p>僕因傾慕申報發起讀者助學金諸君子之熱忱，又深嘗靑年無力就學之苦痛，故竭我棉薄，輪將區區積儲。辱承申報編者，於上月二十一日社評內獎飾過當，曷勝愧郝！爰就鄙人身世，告之入選諸生，爲前車之鑒心。</p>
<p>鄙人幼失怙恃，家徒四壁，家兄雖靑一衿，膏火所入，微之又微，故予年十七，即遭失學。爲飢寒所迫，不得不離家就業，抑予滿懷好學之心，含淚遠走百里外之山村，於雜貨肆中充一學徒。肆主原非素豐　夫婦二人，添一學徒，已呼負擔太重。</p>
<p>故担柴，汲水，洗衣煮飯，均令予一人任之，且每餐飲食，祇限二盂，多添即遭店主白眼。嗟來之食，和淚俱嚥，致釀成胃病，壯年而益劇。店主奇儉，黃昏不燃燈火，且鄉村又　可讀。予偶向隣居醫油店主假得秋水軒雪鴻軒尺牘兩函，於月光下逐夕揣摩。又兼習珠算，盛夏蚊蚋集背，不知痛癢，而學亦弗輟。隣人吿店主謂予勤學如是，他年必出人頭地，汝縣善視之。期年後，始得月薪八角，能冬穿夾衣，但夏仍無蚊帳，苦何勝言。予年二十，家兄之友仆紹在餘姚布莊內爲司帳，月新僅三元，已爲異數。三年後始携破被一條，毫洋叫角來申應某書局之招考，以珠算第二名入選，每月薪金十四元，安步當車，分文不費。年二十五，爲先人安營窀穸，年二十七始娶妻，予念及寄人籬下，終非久計，因設書攤於福州路，迄今巳逾二十載，半商半讀，雖刻無寗晷，而手不忘書本。始得有今日之成就。年來兩鬢一斑，薄有盈餘，但　數資助於放中戚友，及慈善機關，因此依然淸貧如昨。而於捐助之款，概不記載姓名，因予不願藉此阿堵以沾名釣譽也。今諸生爲環境所迫，有讀書之志，而無讀書之力，幸賴援助，得以入學，此最難得之機緣也。昔唐太宗云：予年十八，尙在民間，深知民間疾苦，故能得貞觀之治媲美成康。晋時民有菜色，惠帝曰何不食肉糜，致有五代之亂，靑衣之辱，聖人云天降大任於斯人也，必先苦共心志，勞其筋骨，今諸生機遇，較僕爲優，尙望本囊螢擊壁之旨，寒暑勤讀不輟，將來爲國家柱石，社會導師。本申報社評人之諄誡，今日雖借助於社會，日後仍能還之社會，則豈但一人之幸，社會國家實利賴焉，諸生勉乎哉！</p>

<p>書誰都不能吾認它是人生最重要精神食糧的供給者。筆者素喜閱書，可憐在此百物高昂書價疊增的當兒，爲了經濟的脅迫，不得小使讀書慾常常鬧着飢慌。在這孤島令人窒息的氣氛裏，而不能獲得適當的精神食糧，確是一件萬分遺憾的事，但遺憾究是遺憾，不能以此饜足讀書慾望。跑跑圖書館呢，好的東西，難得輪到，就是借到，可是要在一個短短的時間內，要悉心體會一本書籍內容，實有一力所不逮」之感，因此對於舊書發生愛戀了。它雖「敗絮其外」，但內容未嘗因此减色，可謂「金玉其中」，所以常常乘着暇時，光顧各舊書店，以低廉的代價找尋心愛的書，往往能「如願以償」。在新書店內一經絕版便無法我到，而舊書店却往往可以發現。爲了「價格廉，種類多」的關係，購者衆多，舊書店的生意也興隆起來，書攤書店之設立如雨後春筍。</p>
<p>上海舊書攤書店的分佈情形，主要集中區有兩處，一是四馬路中段與河南路，一是卡德路，其他如普鐘路，辣斐德路和亞爾培路一帶也有幾家。</p>
<p>四馬路有上海書店，他們收賣種類尙多，但高價値書籍似不大多，美華書店與上述相仿，春秋書店善本少一點，惟售價尙屬公道。傳薪書店大都注重木版書所以新版書甚少。河南路一帶在救火會對面有書攤，靠近商務有一書店，書攤擁有書籍甚多，西書因不諳版子故老版書甚多，靠近商務的上海舊書商店，擁有的書籍很不少，但西書多於中書，所以購者水準甚高，價格較大，別家不敢收進的書籍他們却願收進。西書如此，中書亦然。</p>
<p>現在已屆開學時期，一班莘莘學子，奔波舊書店頗爲忙碌，深願各新舊書店「大大减價」以接濟孤島精神食糧，想負有文化職責的書店老闆們定能慷慨的犧牲一下。</p>
<h3 id="c80">工商業常識　螢光燈種種用途 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 義道</p>
<p>螢光的用途極廣，茲擇其要，略述如下：</p>
<p>因爲發光效率高而省電，所以螢光對於工商業，有莫大裨益。譬如在工廠中，起先用五支光的電力，裝了螢允燈後，足以供給三十五到六十支光，這樣，對出產的速度及精美，有很大的關係。各百貨商店，飯店及辦公室中。如裝設螢光燈，可省電百分之三十以上。博物院內，以前沒有好方法拿名貴難見的北極光，陳列給覜衆看，現在却可利用螢光來模仿北極光了。至於適用住宅的螢光燈，雖有幾種缺點，但現在已有工程師正在設法改善，預料不久就有一種六吋長，半吋粗，適合家庭之用的螢光燈出現了。</p>
<p>在醫學上，螢光能幫助醫生診斷病症，因爲在螢光顯微鏡的審視下，每種不同的微菌有一種不同特別的顏色。譬如；肺結核病菌是黃色的，甲種傷寒病菌是紫黃色的，乙種傷寒病菌是綠黃色的，毒癌菌是靑蓮色的，而康健人的細胞却是純黑色的。</p>
<p>螢光還能破獲罪案，允其是假冒簽名一類的案件。因爲在紫外光錢下，不同的墨水，能射出不同顏色的螢光來，所以塗改支票，文件或偷拆郵件，都可利用螢光的原理偵察出來。還有一種螢光粉劑，可塗在鈔票或商品上，倘若被人偷竊後，那竊賊的手上必染有這粉劑，在燈光下他的手會反射出綠色光來。還有，牛油和麥其林，在陽光下是一樣顏色的，但在紫外光綫下，麥其林却會射出藍色螢光來。新鮮鷄蛋是發射紅色螢光的，但貯藏在十天以上的鷄蛋，却發出紅赭石色，或甚至於藍色的螢光。利用螢光，還能將攙雜在咖啡中的芭菜，或不純潔，劣質的油類鑑別出來。所以螢光對於不良商人，魚目混珠的行爲，無異是一棒喝。</p>
<p>在軍事上螢光的用途，是不容忽視的。如最新式戰機中的燈光，都是螢光，一面可收不刺激機師目光的功效，一面又無被敵人窺見的顧慮。英國的地下防空壕的出入口，都塗有螢光粉劑，可避免敵機的注意。塗有該粉劑的軍事地圓，雖在極暗處，能很淸晰的顯現出來。還有利用螢光來尋覓鎢鑛　苗的美法，現在正在實騐中。</p>

<p>「十成，八成，這倒是神仙也說不定的！他假裝和同行的陳大說，只是把聲音提得很高，存心想讓後面的人聽見。「不過他們有本領盜人，咱們就有本領找人，且看找到了還有什麽話說？－」</p>
<p>秋海棠忙着回頭來向他使眼色，可是小狗子的話已經出口，再也收不回了。</p>
<p>孟老掌櫃的跟他兒媳在後面聽了，却並不回話。那個什麼事都不懂而偏愛管事的孟大嫂是根本沒有話好說，而那孟老頭兒是故意不願跟小狗子鬥口，他只是銜着一枝早烟管冷笑。</p>
<p>「憑你這樣一個不曾見過世面的莊稼人，想把人找回來，可還差得遠咧！」他把身子靠在櫃台上，望着秋海棠等三個人的背影，暗暗這樣想。</p>
<p>這一想，倒也的確有幾分合理。</p>
<p>儘管小狗子是懷着滿腔的忠心，恨不得拚着自己的性命不要，立刻去把梅寳我回來，然而他的能力和見識畢竟太有限。第二天，他雖然帶着那個縣立初中的校工陳大，在樟樹屯裏亂闖了一天，想把那個誆去梅寳的人先認出來，但事情那裏有這樣容易呢？（二〇五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Tensions Rise Between America and Germany: Roosevelt Scheduled to Broadcast Tonight, Willkie Urges a Decisive Response to Challenges and Armed Protection of Ships to Ensure Unobstructed Navigation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th—President Roosevelt will deliver a broadcast address from the White House at 9:00 PM on Sunday. Presidential Secretary Hassett did not reveal the nature of the President's address, but stated that it would be of great significance and last about fifteen minutes. It will be translated into four languages and broadcast worldwide via shortwave. When asked if it was related to the incident involving the destroyer USS Greer, Hassett replied that he could not say, and added that he did not believe the President's decision to speak on Sunday was sudden.</p>
<p>Havas, Hyde Park, 7th—President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver an important speech tomorrow evening, expected to strongly assert the US government's determination to ensure that American ships can sail to Iceland without any hindrance. In addition, it will also touch on the Far East issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th—Former Republican presidential candidate Willkie broadcast a message yesterday during a celebration of the birthday of King Peter of Yugoslavia, urging President Roosevelt to confront the challenge posed by barbaric forces to America's maritime freedom with determination and resolve. He stated that in making this statement, he knew he was speaking for the majority of Americans. He hoped that the US President would notify Germany that the United States expects its ships to navigate the North Atlantic freely and without interference, and that any obstruction would receive its due consequences.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th—The New York Times recently provided a detailed account of the USS Greer incident, stating that Germany has clearly announced that any American warships entering its "combat zone" will be bombarded. We cannot retreat from this threat. The time has come to abolish the various restrictions of the Neutrality Act, arm our ships, and complete their designated missions under naval protection.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th—New York newspapers report that President Roosevelt's motivation for deciding to broadcast tomorrow is largely due to the attack on the destroyer USS Greer. The public is widely speculating about the President's upcoming remarks.</p>
<p>Germany Claims US Warship Initiated Bombing; Submarine Launched Torpedo in Retaliation</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 7th—German officials stated last night that the so-called Greer incident was not a German submarine attacking an American destroyer, but rather an American destroyer dropping depth charges on a German submarine within a German blockade zone and pursuing it relentlessly. The German submarine, in exercising its right to legitimate self-defense, fired on the unidentified destroyer but missed. However, the destroyer continued to pursue the German submarine with depth charges. German officials believe that this incident sufficiently proves that Roosevelt has ordered attacks on all German surface and underwater vessels, deliberately provoking disputes. The German communique regarding this incident stated that at 12:30 PM on September 4, 1941, a German submarine at 62 degrees 31 minutes north latitude and 27 degrees 6 minutes west longitude within the German blockade zone was attacked with depth charges by a destroyer and pursued relentlessly. The German submarine could not identify the nationality of the destroyer and, in legitimate self-defense, fired a single torpedo at the warship at 4:39 PM, which did not hit. The destroyer continued its pursuit until midnight. If American officials, such as the US Navy Department, claim that the German submarine attacked the American destroyer first, their aim is solely to absolve the American warship of the responsibility for attacking the German submarine in violation of neutrality. This incident proves that the President has ordered the US fleet to not only immediately report the location of any German vessels encountered but also to immediately fire upon them. Therefore, the US President is attempting to incite anti-German sentiment in American public opinion in order to enter the war.</p>
<p>US Navy Department Issues Statement Refuting German Claims</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th—The Navy issued the following statement: Although newspapers today carry German claims that the American destroyer USS Greer fired first at the submarine, the truth of the matter is exactly as the Navy Department has stated: the submarine attacked the Greer first, and only then did it retaliate.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 7th—The Atlantic Fleet was ordered yesterday to use aircraft and warships to search for the submarine that attacked the USS Greer three times and "eliminate" it. Germany accuses the Greer of attacking the submarine first, leading the German side to retaliate. The Navy Department reiterated its original statement that the torpedo, fired without warning, struck the Greer first, and only then did the destroyer retaliate with depth charges. White House Secretary Hassett stated at Hyde Park that there was no need to comment on the German accusation that the Greer had attacked the submarine first, as the source of this accusation speaks for itself. The Navy Department offered no other criticisms, but an official spokesperson drew attention to the original announcement. The statement from Berlin confirmed that the submarine was German and indicated that the Greer and other American destroyers could not "eliminate" the submarine. It is generally believed that the search is continuing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th—Officials here indicate that the German claim that the US destroyer USS Greer deliberately provoked a conflict is absolutely not credible. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, stated that Germany should know that the United States will defend its ships and its people. Germany's admission that the incident involved a German submarine is tantamount to admitting that the submarine was ordered by the German government to attack the American destroyer. This spirit of assassination, which disregards the rights of other nations, has already brought the United States into the brink of war. We do not wish to participate in the current war, but if our ships or people are attacked, we will certainly defend them. Connally pointed out that the Berlin statement was merely intended to create the impression that the German submarine had not been sunk.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Reykjavik, 7th—The crew of the USS Greer stated yesterday that the German submarine that attacked the American destroyer last Thursday was sunk when the depth charges were deployed. This is not impossible. News from Berlin and Washington, however, indicates that the submarine is safe.</p>
<p>Takahashi Comments on US-German Relations, Believes the US Will Enter the War Sooner</p>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th—Admiral Takahashi, formerly Commander of the Combined Fleet, told the "Yomiuri Shimbun" that US participation in the European war is only a matter of time. He also stated that the Greer incident has accelerated the timeline for entering the war. Admiral Takahashi stated that although it is too early to know whether the United States will declare war on Germany, the continuation of such incidents could easily lead to an unwanted war. He also said that Germany lacks a fleet and therefore cannot engage in a large-scale decisive battle against the United States. However, Germany will adopt submarine tactics, which will be effective. He also stated that Germany certainly hopes the United States will engage in open warfare so that Germany can also openly attack merchant ships and warships, sinking them all upon discovery. Takahashi said that what the United States is most worried about now is its relations with Japan and its Pacific military strategy. If war breaks out in the Pacific, it will be very difficult for the United States to fight on both oceans. However, Takahashi acknowledged that the US Atlantic Fleet and the British Fleet are more than capable of dealing with Germany, and the United States can deploy the remaining fleet to fight in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Associated Press, 7th—Japanese newspapers today prominently published news of the attack on the US destroyer USS Greer. Most criticized the US warship for being subjected to such an attack. The Mainichi Shimbun stated that such attacks were to be expected because the Neutrality Act had been repealed, and the Lend-Lease Act had invalidated the cash-and-carry provisions of the Neutrality Act. The newspaper pointed out that regardless of any excuses for further amendments, the loss of ships aiding Britain will have the effect of completely abolishing neutrality. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the US occupation of Iceland is effectively equivalent to abolishing neutrality, and the Greer incident is tantamount to a warship of a belligerent nation being attacked in a war zone. The newspaper stated that the Greer incident occurred because the United States declared neutrality on one hand while also insisting on the rights of a belligerent nation. However, the newspaper pointed out that caution must be taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the Pacific.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Remains Focused, Awaiting US President's Reply; US Public Opinion Largely Favors War Against Japan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th—Tokyo is still focused on awaiting President Roosevelt's reply to Konoe, as this reply will indicate the nature of the negotiations currently underway in Washington. Officials are silent regarding US-Japan talks, stating that the content of Konoe's secret letter to the US President is known only to Konoe and his close aides. US Secretary of State Hull's statement on Friday that the US President's reply would be issued soon was prominently published in newspapers here yesterday. In any case, responsible observers say that there will be concrete developments within this month or in the coming days. A few optimists believe that the current pessimism is merely a smokescreen to conceal the true direction of events, as Japan has many ships available for use, which at least provides a basis for compromise. However, pessimists say that Japan cannot honorably change its adopted course, and the United States cannot agree with Japan's adopted course, so a fundamental solution is impossible.</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 6th—Regarding the news that American ships carrying aviation gasoline have arrived in Vladivostok, Japanese censors have prohibited newspapers from publishing it. According to reliable sources here, some progress has been made in US-Japan negotiations, further proving that Japan does not want to obstruct American supplies from reaching the Soviet Union through Japanese territorial waters in order to avoid causing any incidents that could hinder rapprochement between the two sides. However, the Japanese government is maintaining the policy it decided on in mid-August, namely that Japan will adopt a compromising attitude, but only in exchange for diplomatic concessions from the US and the Soviet Union. The issue of American oil being transported to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok may be discussed together with the overall US-Japan issue in Washington.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th—The Gallup Poll conducted a public opinion survey, asking the question: "Do you think the United States should now try to prevent Japan from becoming more aggressive, even at the risk of war with Japan?" Now that the survey is complete, the results show that 70% voted yes, 18% voted no, and 12% were undecided.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 7th—The State Department yesterday formally denied reports from Buenos Aires, Argentina, that the United States had requested Argentina to represent American diplomatic interests in Tokyo in the event of war. The State Department stated that such rumors were baseless because US-Japan relations were clearly not on the verge of collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Current Situation in Vietnam Under Japanese Control <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 7th—A Vietnamese government official told a Reuters correspondent today that rumors about the strength of Japanese forces in Vietnam, that French troops have been disarmed and confined to barracks under Japanese surveillance, and that the Vietnamese government's authority has been almost completely stripped away are all unfounded. The number of Japanese troops arriving in Vietnam is less than the theoretically stipulated number. Since the first batch arrived, only a few transport ships have docked, and most of what they carry is machinery. Although some French troops have been transferred out, and a joint defense zone has been agreed upon, the French military organization and command remain intact, and civil administration continues as usual. French and Japanese authorities have agreed on some restrictions to protect the interests of both sides and prevent the leakage of important military information. Although minor incidents occasionally occur, the Japanese are currently maintaining very strict discipline.</p>

<p>Reuters, Batavia, 7th—Lockheed aircraft, used as transports capable of carrying 20 airborne soldiers and paratroopers, are currently being used in the Dutch East Indies, and paratroopers are being trained here according to American methods. Military leaders here understand the significant value that paratroopers represent in this decisive war. Although they hope the Dutch East Indies will not have to use such troops, they believe that this equipment is indispensable in the Dutch East Indies' preparations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 7th—Five Dutch East Indies government officials will soon depart for the United States and then to England to serve in the Dutch government in London. After arriving in the United States, they will likely fly to London on bombers crossing the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 7th—The "Thai Capital Daily" published an article today welcoming the new Japanese ambassador's guarantee of Japanese friendship to Thailand, but stated that the Japanese ambassador should pay close attention to the behavior of newly arrived Japanese in Thailand, saying that they do not understand the character of the Thai people, and their words and actions harm the feelings of the Thai people. Thailand, for the sake of maintaining friendly relations between Japan and Thailand, has overlooked certain incidents, which will inevitably lead to serious consequences. It is hoped that the Japanese ambassador will strictly instruct newly arrived Japanese to have a better understanding of the Thai people. Thai people are peaceful, gentle, and generous, but will never accept insults.</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Greer Incident and US-Japan Talks <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The situation in the Pacific has made no progress, and a huge wave has risen in the Atlantic due to the bombing of the American destroyer Greer. The US public opinion has been extremely excited for days, and the German government has brazenly admitted this, using the ship's entry into the German blockade zone as a reason for bombardment. Although the ship was not damaged, the serious nature of this issue is clearly beyond comparison to the incidents of the Robin Moor or the Tuila.</p>
<p>The sinking of the Robin Moor by a German submarine in May was largely considered by the world to be intended to force the United States to enter the war. In retrospect, its true intention was more to test the extent of the American reaction in order to judge whether the United States would restrain Germany when the war against the Soviet Union broke out, just as the Japanese army sunk two Soviet gunboats in the Heilongjiang before the "July 7th Incident." After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the international situation changed, and both belligerent and non-belligerent countries were in a delicate state in which pulling one hair would move the whole body. Germany, which is attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength, has not achieved a decisive victory in the past two and a half months, and its eagerness for favorable changes to occur in other corners of the world goes without saying. If the United States and Germany confront each other with weapons, Japan has a legal obligation to provide assistance. In terms of interests, this is a good opportunity for expansion. The trend of events will inevitably lead to close cooperation and mutual assistance with Germany. Germany's decision to deliberately provoke a serious dispute with the United States over the Greer incident is probably exactly this kind of intention.</p>
<p>The reason cited by Germany that the American warship entered the blockade zone is obviously unacceptable to the US authorities and is also contrary to the traditional American policy of advocating maritime freedom. Now the various warships of the US Atlantic Fleet have been ordered to search for the German submarines that caused the incident and destroy them. The reaction from the US government and public will be greater than that of the Robin Moor incident in June. As for how it will decide or retaliate for this incident, President Roosevelt will deliver a "significant" speech tonight. Even if the speech is not made for this temporary incident and may not even explicitly mention it, the occurrence of this issue has undoubtedly deeply affected the spirit and policy of the US government. The direction of its future course is difficult to discern from tonight's speech.</p>
<p>If Germany's intention is indeed as pointed out above, focusing on the future development of US-Japan relations, then the current situation in the Pacific may be the most important factor in determining the future international situation. Regarding the progress of US-Japan talks, the rumors have differed recently. The US authorities have always stated that the talks have made no progress, while news from Tokyo has stated that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly. In this confusing state, it is difficult to discern the truth of the facts. But what can be asserted is that the claim that the negotiations have stalled is still too early, and the claim that they are proceeding smoothly also contains a sense of self-consolation. The Japanese side hopes only for a reduction in economic pressure, while the US side aims at a thorough resolution of political issues. Since the starting points of the two sides are clearly different, the negotiating stances are also very different. Moreover, the Japanese side's fundamental intention may only be to delay time through this, and there is no way to fundamentally resolve this issue. However, despite these differences, the channel for negotiations has never been blocked. The delivery of Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt and the successive safe arrivals of American oil tankers in Vladivostok show that the howling and impatience of Japanese extremists cannot affect the current policy of the Japanese authorities. Although the US government has repeatedly stated that its Far East policy remains unchanged and guarantees that it will no longer appease Japan, it has not abandoned attempts on the diplomatic path. However, this situation of stalemate between the two sides is extremely fragile. Any relevant international changes are sufficient to cause deviations. The outbreak of the Greer incident is probably a move arranged by the Nazis who have taken aim at this situation. The progress of US-Japan talks, even if it has no practical effect, is always a danger to Germany. If a compromise is reached between the United States and Japan, no matter whether Japan is willing to withdraw from the Axis or not, it will always sacrifice Germany's interests to some extent. Moreover, after the United States' security in the Pacific is guaranteed, it will inevitably increase its power to attack the Nazis. Therefore, it is better to risk prompting the United States to enter the war, provoking a dispute between the United States and Germany, in order to indirectly boost Japan's arrogance and make the attempt to compromise between the United States and Japan fail. From the perspective of the Nazis' current situation, only if the United States is under threat from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans for a long time, and even has to fight on both fronts, is the most favorable ideal state for Germany.</p>
<p>The current situation is indeed difficult for the United States to deal with, but the European situation has the support of Britain and the Soviet Union, and the Nazis' maritime power is insufficient to deal with Britain, and the Far East has the strong ABCD defense line. In terms of responding to changes, there is also more than enough leeway. In fact, the United States does not need to feel anxious. At present, the Atlantic is tense again due to the activities of German submarines, but the center of the international situation is still in the Pacific. If the Far East is thoroughly clarified, the resolution of the European situation will also reduce major constraints and difficulties. The US-Japan talks are simply wasting time and doing nothing to help. Germany's threat to the United States at this time is a serious lesson that the United States should pay attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Zhongshan University Professor Luo Xianglin Discovers Sun Yat-sen's Family Genealogy; Ancestors Originally Lived in Bianliang and Chenzhou; Moved to Guangdong During the Yuan and Ming Dynasties <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Guilin—From Sun Yat-sen's twelfth-generation ancestor Su Changgong to Sun Yat-sen, there were eleven generations. The ancestral birth and death records kept in Sun Yat-sen's hometown in Zhongshan County did not record anything before Su Changgong due to repeated migrations. Luo Xianglin, a professor at Zhongshan University, has been researching the origins of surnames for many years. He once discovered Sun Yat-sen's upper-generation genealogy in Dongjiang, Guangdong. The generations, names, and deeds from Sun Yat-sen's first ancestor to the twelfth-generation ancestor Lian Changgong are very clear, which is enough to prove that Sun Yat-sen's upper generations originally lived in Bianliang and Chenzhou before the Tang Dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang Dynasty, he was selected to live in Ningdu, Jiangxi, for leading troops to quell the Huang Chao rebellion. During the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, he was again selected to live in Guangdong. After the Manchus entered the Pass, he once resisted Qing soldiers in the countryside with Zhong Dingsheng of the same village. After the defeat, he dispersed the strong men who had surrendered. During the Kangxi period, he migrated to Yongkou, Zhongshan, for land reclamation. Several generations later, he moved to Cuiheng Township. Each decision to migrate was related to the changes of the times. It is reported that Mr. Luo discovered this valuable information and, at the same time, consulted various books and mutually authenticated them before obtaining this clear clue. He is now writing a special book to promote the origin of Sun Yat-sen's family, so that those who study the history of the party and the country can have a reference. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">U.S. Secretary of Security McNutt Publishes Article: China Will Surely Win; Heroic Combat Known Worldwide; International Aid Greater Than Before <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>New Aviation News: U.S. Secretary of Security McNutt published an article in the August issue of the New Aviation English China Monthly, titled "The Inevitable Victory of China." The gist of the article is that the heroic combat of China is now widely understood throughout the world. The aid that China receives from democratic countries around the world is also greater than before. Several years ago, there was a period when the world did not feel concerned about the issues of China, Austria, Abyssinia, or Czechoslovakia. For example, although people generally detested the creation of Manchukuo, they did not consider it (our business). However, those with foresight felt that the rights and interests of any country are related to the freedom, sovereignty, integrity, and goodwill of the people of other countries. Unfortunately, the world recognized this fact too late, so it is now more difficult to restore the previous order. I believe that the United States has the honor of taking action in the world, and I believe that maintaining this honor is our duty. Before I went to Manila (McNutt served as the High Commissioner to the Philippines from 1933 to 1939), and after taking office, I closely adhered to the government's policy on the Far East issue. The relationship between the United States and the Far East must not be abandoned to appease the political tools currently in power in Tokyo. Seventeen types of raw material necessities for our national defense strategy come from the Far East. The United States must not allow any country to monopolize and restrict our use. McNutt also said that in order to maintain the common destiny of free people around the world, we should stand with China today. The Pacific issue urgently needs to be resolved. After this issue is resolved, not only will the issues of China and Vietnam be resolved, but also the Japanese civilians who have long been in pain will gain new freedom. The time for action has arrived. The changes in the situation increasingly prove the necessity of action. It has now brought us into a new union. The United States and China must each assume the responsibility of destroying the violence that destroys free people around the world. Victory will surely come. China, in this victory, will lead the Far East. From the great past, we dare to assert that what will arise in its place must be an era of wise and upright governance. China, the British Empire, the Americas, and other free nations will be able to rebuild a standard for the world. Under this standard, wisdom and glory will surely be repeated. In addition, those who published in the magazine also include General Yan Luer's "(Defensive Lifeline)," Representative Kaufer's "Oil Embargo on Japan," Minister Weng Wenhao's "Sino-Japanese Economic War," Senator Kripinger's "Who are Japan's Allies?" and other papers, all of which are very valuable. The full text of Chairman Chiang's "Letter to Friendly Nations" has been published, which is receiving great attention from Americans, because American newspapers generally only carry the telegrams of the day, and the content is brief and cannot give a complete picture. In order to facilitate Americans' collection of important international and Far East documents, this publication's mission is extremely important (7th dispatch).</p>

<h3 id="e14">German-Finnish Allied Forces Reinforce: Siege of Leningrad Intensifies; Soviet Garrison Vows to Defend City to the Death; No German Progress on Central Front <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Havas Agency, 6th Dispatch from a certain location on the Soviet border: Seventy-seven days have passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The fighting in the Leningrad area is intensifying. The German army has repeatedly reinforced the siege of the city, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. However, General Voroshilov, commander of the Northern Red Army, is determined to defend the city to the death. In recent days, German heavy artillery and aircraft have continuously bombarded the city in an attempt to discourage the garrison. At the same time, Finnish troops have also approached the city and seem unwilling to abandon the war and make peace. The situation on the southern front at the port of Odessa is also the same. The Red Army is determined to extract a heavy price from the enemy before abandoning the port. The Romanian army's strength is not very strong, but it has received reinforcements from Italian troops, increasing its momentum slightly. However, on the central front, the German army has not made good progress. The two sides are still fighting in the areas of Gomel, Smolensk, and Bryansk. According to German war reports, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses, similar to the "annihilation war" that occurred in the areas of Bialystok and Minsk. In addition, the situation in the Dnieper River basin has not changed. According to Soviet sources, the German army's repeated attempts to cross the river have failed.</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: The Eastern Front war has reached its twelfth week. The intensity of the war in the Leningrad area has increased. Moscow news reports that last night Soviet troops drove German troops out of a certain village south of Leningrad. The German side claims to have occupied a station on the old Finnish border north of Leningrad. German radio reports admit that some traffic between Leningrad and the west has not yet been cut off, and that German troops along the Gulf of Finland have been continuously bombarded by Soviet ships. A German spokesman could not confirm the claim in Berlin newspapers that at least one part of the outer defenses of Leningrad had been breached, only stating that the city was under continuous artillery fire.</p>
<p>United Press, 7th Dispatch from Berlin: An authoritative German military spokesman announced last night that German and Finnish troops are intensifying their encirclement of Leningrad and have cut off all important railway and highway traffic between the city and the outside world. Soviet troops are now laying landmines in an attempt to prevent German troops from advancing through the swamps and fields around Leningrad. According to news received in Berlin, engineers from a German unit removed more than 2,000 landmines in a 75-mile advance. Soviet troops also destroyed roads every few hundred yards and placed artillery and tanks on small patches of hard ground in the swamps, making it almost impossible for German troops to reach. Another obstacle hindering the German advance is that Soviet snipers often harass German troops from the rear.</p>
<p>United Press, 10th Dispatch from Helsinki: Yesterday's Finnish news from the front said that the situation in Leningrad is extremely chaotic. German and Finnish troops are pressing toward the city with a fierce pincer offensive. The news stated that the dense smoke of the fire could be seen. At the same time, Berlin radio reported that German heavy artillery had successfully bombarded Leningrad's power plants and munitions factories.</p>
<p>United Press, 7th Dispatch from London: Well-informed sources in the United Kingdom stated last night that the battle of Leningrad has not changed significantly in the past 24 hours. Although the weather has been extremely bad in the past week, the war continues to unfold. These sources expressed skepticism about German reports that the city was under heavy artillery bombardment, believing that the Germans would not have enough time to excavate and construct positions for heavy artillery, as was done along the occupied areas of the English Channel. British experts suspect that the German army will attempt to bypass Leningrad, as there is a danger of leaving a strong fortress threatening its flanks.</p>
<p>United Press, 7th Dispatch from Moscow: According to news from the front yesterday, the Soviet Red Army gained the upper hand in the two areas of Kiev and the Dnieper River front. Fierce fighting continues to occur around the roads leading to Leningrad.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dispatch from Moscow: A Soviet communiqué released at midnight stated that yesterday, German motorized troops, infantry, and artillery were heavily attacked by the Soviet Air Force on the battlefield, and enemy aircraft were also destroyed on the airfield. Yesterday, Soviet troops fought fiercely with enemy troops along the entire line. According to accurate figures, 56 German aircraft were shot down on September 3, which corrects the previous inaccurate report of 33 aircraft. On September 4, a total of 61 German aircraft were shot down during aerial combat and attacks on enemy airfields. Seven Soviet aircraft were lost.</p>
<p>Red Army Launches Courageous Counteroffensive Along the Entire Front: German Side Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Moscow: A Soviet supplementary communiqué stated that on September 4, Soviet troops killed more than 15,000 German officers and soldiers along the entire line and destroyed more than 100 artillery pieces of various calibers, 34 machine gun nests, 40 mortar launchers, 18 pontoon and landing docks, 940 vehicles, and 180 tanks and armored vehicles. German troops in the central zone of the front also suffered heavy losses. In this area, Soviet troops launched an attack, destroying 22 fortifications, 8 flat-trajectory artillery teams, 12 machine guns, and 5 mortar launchers, killing 800 German officers and soldiers, and capturing many boxes of artillery shells and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. In another area of the central front, a Soviet unit defeated three companies of enemy infantry and destroyed or captured 12 machine guns, 2 tanks, and 18 mortar launchers.</p>
<p>Residents of Odessa Calm: Defense Line Approximately Seven Miles from the City</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: According to a Soviet general who recently returned to Moscow from Odessa, the defense line of Odessa is currently approximately seven miles from the city, forming an irregular semicircle. Streetcars, buses, and trucks in the city continue to operate as usual, and newspapers are still being published.</p>
<p>TASS, 7th Dispatch from Moscow: The attempt by fascists to break through the defenses of Odessa has been completely shattered by the unwavering strength of the city's heroic defenders. A naval unit, with the assistance of our artillery fire, launched two attacks on an enemy infantry division. As a result of the fierce fighting, the elite troops of the enemy division were defeated. The German-Romanian forces' attack on Odessa has suffered huge losses in both manpower and materiel.</p>
<p>Reports of British Aircraft Appearing Over Soviet Airspace: Blackshirts Open Eastern Front to Aid the War</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Rome: Rome Radio announced last night that British aircraft are currently being used in the fighting around Leningrad.</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Zurich: News from Rome states that some of the Italian mechanized units inspected by Mussolini yesterday in central Italy will be sent to the Eastern Front. It is said that when Mussolini recently met with Hitler at his headquarters, he promised to add these troops to the Soviet front.</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: Roman radio reports have reported that British aircraft were among the aircraft shot down by the German side, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, 7th Dispatch from Rome: Mussolini's spokesman, Gaida, published an article in the Italian People's Voice today, stating that Germany's operations on the Eastern Front originally did not intend to occupy the entire Soviet Union, but only planned to attack the European part of the Soviet Union, occupy important areas, and then stop when appropriate. These important areas should include the cities of Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev, and Kharkov. It is absolutely impossible for the Soviet Union to resist until 1942.</p>

<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: The "Observer" diplomatic correspondent claims that the aid issue is only one item on the great agenda of the British and American mission to Moscow. The entire issue of the Far East battlefield is likely to be included. It is reported that the US-Japan talks have stalled, and the distance to the "negotiation stage is still very far. It is generally believed that Japan will inevitably take some retaliatory action against the arrival of American oil tankers in Vladivostok. British, American, and Soviet discussions will be held on a complete military plan to counter Japan's possible war with the United States in the Far East. In short, this Moscow conference is bound to become one of the most important stages in the war.</p>
<p>United Press, 7th Dispatch from Washington: Authoritative circles announced yesterday that the United Kingdom and the United States hope to discuss providing large-scale assistance to the Soviet Union at the upcoming Moscow conference, even if it means reducing their own military equipment. It is understood that the two countries have drafted an agreement to provide the Soviet Union with more assistance than previously planned, because the Red Army's strong resistance is satisfactory. It is widely believed that the two governments have agreed that aiding the Soviet Union is currently the best way to defeat Germany. Well-informed sources claim that the Soviet Union's resistance has caused significant damage to Germany's manpower and resources. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union's resistance can last at least until the winter is over. Officials also said that although the German army has suffered 1.5 million casualties, it is widely believed that the British and American missions have a detailed plan for the maximum amount of aid to the Soviet Union, promising to immediately ship goods to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Edinburgh: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood spoke here yesterday, especially on providing all possible financial assistance to the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet side had stated that it did not want gratuitous financial aid, but requested credit loans. The United Kingdom has gladly agreed to this without restrictions. The United Kingdom is still able to support huge war expenditures. He believes that the United Kingdom can get through this fiscal year without raising taxes. The people must automatically make greater savings. The United Kingdom has spent £12.5 million daily in the past few weeks, of which £10.5 million was used for the war. We are willing to shoulder extremely heavy financial burdens, not only for ourselves but also for the common cause of freedom and justice. The people of other countries who voluntarily bear extremely heavy consumption taxes are not as numerous as the British. The British Empire also makes financial contributions. The autonomous territories and India have made great sacrifices, and the colonies have also generously contributed. He is deeply grateful. This year, the people must allocate their real savings to lend 200 million pounds to the country. In this war situation, the worst thing besides defeatism is leisure. We must redouble our efforts to increase the savings of the people.</p>

<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Washington: The newly built B-7E four-engine bomber will be mass-produced in the United States for use by the United Kingdom. It will be an improved flying fortress with a larger fuselage. The Department of War announced last night that the new aircraft weighs 30 tons, unlike the existing flying fortress, which weighs 24 tons. Gun turrets are placed above and below the fuselage, and there is also one at the tail, in order to defend against attacks from any direction. The Department of War also stated that there are four bomber command groups in the War Command of the Army Air Corps, which are the backbone of the air force. The Department of War continued to say that the aircraft ordered from the Boeing Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Seattle and the Douglas Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Santa Monica, California, totaled $347,156,000, including the new flying fortress, which is estimated to be worth more than $300,000 each.</p>

<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Tehran: A Reuters special correspondent claims that after British troops entered the town of Sudan Bad, all important oil wells within Iranian territory have been placed under British protection. Sudan Bad is located on the railway line across Persia. The British occupation has, in effect, gained a control point on this major transportation line between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. One German technician was arrested when British troops entered, and three other German nationals have fled to Isfahan. At the same time, the delay in the release of the terms of British and Soviet occupation has caused anxiety among the Iranian people. The Iranians' sincere welcome of the British troops was largely based on the hope of universal reform in the near future. However, the British promise not to interfere in internal affairs has made Iran responsible for all reforms, which may be difficult to achieve under the current political structure. Therefore, it is generally hoped that the conditions proposed by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will promote the realization of reform. Another result of the delay in the release of the British and Soviet conditions is that the Germans in Iran are becoming increasingly emboldened. The German nationals under surveillance by the Iranian police are now openly appearing in the streets. The leader of the Nazi spies in Tehran appeared on the market for the first time on Saturday. The reply handed over by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to the Iranian government on Friday afternoon was studied by the Iranian government yesterday morning. The parliament may declare something on this matter when it convenes today.</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Tehran: It is widely believed that the issue of dealing with German nationals in Iran is still under consideration. It is reported that the Iranian government, fearing future retaliation and considering that Germans and many Iranian dignitaries have good feelings for each other, is unwilling to ignore this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Prohibition of Imports and the Black Market <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Haibo</p>
<p>The impact of import prohibitions on the Shanghai commodity market has been detailed in my previous writings. Now, what about the impact on the city's financial market? This can be discussed based on the sources of the prohibited items: these banned imports mainly come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the customs districts of Northeast China. Such as silk and rayon fabrics, woolen cloth and its products, seafood, fruits, dried fruits, candies, sugar for food, foreign liquor, beverages, tobacco, paper, fur, bone, horn, wood and bamboo mats, porcelain, glassware, musical instruments, toys, cosmetics, umbrellas, and so on. The prohibition of these imports in China is enough to adjust the international balance of payments, enough to promote domestic industries, enough to improve social customs and restore the beauty of frugality; in Japan, it will affect its export industries. This is the economic warfare aspect of the import prohibition policy. The most important thing to pay attention to in import and export trade policy is not the future supply and demand of prohibited goods, but the impact that the exchange market may have after the strict implementation of import prohibitions. Because the fluctuation of the exchange market is the fluctuation of the entire price market. The fluctuation of the entire price market is enough to hinder the country's financial stability and disrupt the security of the entire national economy.</p>
<p>The nine banks specifically authorized by the Exchange Stabilization Fund to handle future exchange supply and demand matters are assumed to be able to absolutely refuse to supply the demand for exchange bills for these prohibited import items. In this case, our country's legitimate foreign exchange market will invisibly reduce the burden of such import needs, such as the huge amount of over 230 million yuan in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). That is, on the supply side, it invisibly increases foreign exchange resources by more than 230 million yuan. It can be known that this is absolutely beneficial to stabilizing the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Imports and the Black Market Wang Haibo</p>
<p>However, most of our country's import and export ports and their customs are currently in Japanese-occupied areas. Therefore, it is feared that the customs in various places will not be able to enforce this prohibition and prevent the import of these banned items. If foreign exchange control is effective and the black market is indeed eliminated, then even if unscrupulous merchants try to continue importing these items, they will not be able to achieve their goal because they cannot obtain foreign exchange for imports. However, the export of local products from the occupied areas is mostly in the hands of the Japanese. At this time, it is not difficult for Japanese merchants to export Chinese products in exchange for these prohibited imported goods for sale in China. These commodity markets are being affected by the import prohibition, and speculators are raising prices. In this case, Japanese merchants operating in this area will reap even greater profits. This is still what most people worry about regarding the future of the current import prohibition trade policy.</p>
<p>This concern is reasonable. However, we believe that for the current implementation of the import prohibition,</p>
<p>Assuming that in addition to the legitimate exchange market supplied by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, there is also an illegal black market. Then the demand for exchange bills for these prohibited imports will inevitably flock to this black market. As a result, the exchange rate in the black market will definitely be lower than the legal supply market rate under the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Assuming that most of the legal imports at this time have been satisfied by the legal supply market under the Exchange Stabilization Fund, but a small part that is not approved for supply may also turn to this black market. Therefore, although the pressure on the black market has been lighter than in the past, it is still significant. As a result, it is still extremely difficult to maintain the black market's low exchange rate. This is another area where the general public still has concerns about the future of the exchange market. However, this concern is still stuck in the rut of knowing only one thing and not the other. Let's analyze it.</p>
<p>(1) Assuming that the black market can still exist, and the black exchange rate must be lower than the supply exchange rate in the legal market. Then all export exchange bills that are beyond the reach of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will inevitably go to the black market, forming a source of supply in the black market. And all the import needs that were originally supplied by the black market will now be largely supplied by the legal market; as far as the black market is concerned, it has undoubtedly reduced its burden. Therefore, the maintenance of the black market exchange rate may actually be possible even in the market for legal supply.</p>
<p>(2) Assuming that the price of all imported goods supplied legally in the future is definitely more expensive than before according to the shelf of the exchange bills that should be settled for them, it will be greatly affected in its sales market. For this reason, it is enough to make importers prefer to wait for the supply of the legal exchange market for legal import trade, rather than get involved in the black market. Then the pressure on the black market can be further reduced. However, if the price of imported goods settled in the legal exchange market is not managed, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be sold at the same price as the price of imported goods settled in the black market; in this case, the effect of legal supply of exchange to stabilize prices will disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, the exchange rate in the black market can still be naturally maintained. The problem lies in the legally supplied market. First, the export exchange bill resources will be taken away by the black market, causing the legally supplied market to fall into a predicament of having supply but no one to buy. Second, the expensive import prices formed by the black market exchange rate are enough to induce the illegal increase of the cheaper import prices formed by the legal exchange rate, thereby making the significance of exchange control disappear. To solve these two major shortcomings, the elimination of the black market is indeed an indispensable condition.</p>
<p>In fact, to reduce Shanghai's black market, it is only necessary for the United States and Britain to implement their laws on freezing Chinese funds. That is, in the future, all foreign exchange not supplied by the designated banks under the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not be given legal protection and effectiveness. In this case, the right to supply all exchange bills can be absolutely concentrated under the power of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. As a result, all possible sales of export exchange bills, that is, the exchange market under the power of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has no other. Therefore, it is undoubtedly reduced without eliminating the black market itself. The import of non-urgent, non-essential, and even luxury goods can also be completely prohibited.</p>

<p>— Zhu Ruofu</p>
<p>Problems that Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>The issue of the legal tender (fapi) is still the most concerned topic in street gossip, but few people have openly discussed it in recent months. This silence will only make the public's understanding of this issue more confusing; it will only make the opinions of those who decide this issue more narrow and stubborn; however, this is by no means a cause for celebration.</p>
<p>How can a country's currency issue only affect the prosperity or decline of the entire national economy? The economies of other countries that have trade relations with it are also closely related. Therefore, any currency change in a country will not only affect the people and economy of the country concerned, but also affect other trading partners. Moreover, the deeper the trade relationship, the greater the impact. In this Sino-Japanese War, in which international trade plays a decisive role in the war economy, the complexity of the currency issue is not unexpected.</p>
<p>Although the US freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds is not thorough, it has, after all, pushed the currency war centered on legal tender into a decisive new era. Precisely because the freezing measures are not thorough, its flexibility is particularly great. This era can be said to be a critical moment of waiting for reason to return.</p>
<p>The Trade Status of the Yen</p>
<p>The importance of currency status in China's war economy is less than that of Japan. At present, Japan is still able to maintain considerable trade relations with democratic countries, entirely relying on the pursuit of profit by individuals in the free economic system of democratic countries. Profit is measured by currency. If Japan's monetary system is chaotic, it will be impossible to maintain foreign trade relations. If the UK and the US strictly enforce the fund freezing order, then British and American merchants will no longer have the possibility of pursuing profits, and it will make the yen completely unable to gain a foothold in the international exchange market: at this time, Japan's last bit of sustaining power for foreign trade will also disappear, unless it uses its military force to control the overseas markets it needs, but this hope is very small.</p>
<p>As for China, it is different. China's foreign trade is not only built on the individual economic desire for profit, but also built on the political needs of both countries involved. Therefore, China's currency has friendly allies in the international exchange market, and at the same time, it has political needs for mutual exchange in the international commodity market. In other words: China's foreign trade relies on the mutual individual economic desires of both parties, and also has the overall national desires of both parties as its background. Japan only has the former. Therefore, once the Pacific War breaks out, the possibility of Japan's foreign trade will be limited to a very small area; the status of legal tender in foreign trade will remain unchanged. Shipping conditions, although absolutely important in China's future foreign trade, are less of a problem in Japan. But under the major premise of politics, the situation will also be the opposite of the current situation. Just as the US, due to its alignment of interests with the Soviet Union in the Soviet-German War, not only provided gasoline to the Soviet Union, but also braved all dangers to supply the 8,428-ton tanker "United," sailing to Vladivostok. Although Japan has some ocean-going ships, on the day the United States announced the freezing of Japanese assets, the Japanese cargo ship Tatsuta Maru, although it had approached San Francisco, had to turn back and drift on the ocean surface for several days, daring not</p>
<p>These are the two fundamentally different basic situations in the future Pacific War regarding the foreign trade possibilities of China and Japan. At the same time, it is also enough to reflect the different fates of legal tender and yen in the future Pacific War. A currency that cannot fulfill its function as a medium in international trade fundamentally loses its value as a currency.</p>
<p>The Trade Status of Legal Tender</p>
<p>In the future Pacific War, the yen will be forced to withdraw from its role as a medium in foreign trade; the status of legal tender will remain unchanged. The Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun published an article after the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, roughly saying: If the Pacific War breaks out, Shanghai will be like Switzerland in the European War, becoming a center for the exchange of materials between the Axis and the Democrats. At that time, the Shanghai market will not only not decline, but will prosper, and the sustaining power of this prosperity is due to the role of legal tender in facilitating it. Because only legal tender has international currency qualifications at that time, the value of legal tender will not only not decrease, but will increase more and more. Whether this observation is right or wrong depends on whether cargo ships can still sail to Shanghai at that time? But if cargo ships can continue to come, then without a doubt, only legal tender is competent as a medium in international trade. In other words: if legal tender ceases its function as a medium in international trade in Shanghai, then Shanghai's foreign trade will definitely plummet; even if there is no war in the Pacific, there may be no way to recover it.</p>
<p>In order to prevent Japan from using legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, China is currently promoting a trade management system in Shanghai. The Exchange Stabilization Fund handles the supply of all foreign exchange in Shanghai, and those trade management regulations that are beneficial to China's wartime economy regarding prohibited and permitted imports are used as the standard for foreign exchange supply and refusal. Therefore, the free function of legal tender to purchase foreign exchange has already been restricted. As a result, those who hold legal tender are just like those who hold British pounds in the United States. Although they cannot freely purchase goods overseas with British pounds, the international value of all their British pounds is not lost. On the contrary, once trade is managed, the international balance of payments can be adjusted; the exchange control effect can stabilize the exchange rate of the currency to a considerable extent. Obviously, this is to make the wealth of legal tender holders even more guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Outlook for Shanghai Trade John Ahlers <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Su Ru Translation</p>
<p>The coming autumn will be a difficult time for the economy and finance of the Far East. Will Japan risk an open war with the United States and Britain to try to occupy another territory? If not, will she continue to offend and threaten democratic countries, risking the danger of greater economic and financial retaliation, such as the democratic front prohibiting all economic exchanges with all places within Japan's sphere of influence? If none of these situations materialize, then how will the future Far East continue to trade with the rest of the world? And how will the very serious food problem be resolved?</p>
<p>There are often some—even now there are still some dreamers among Shanghai's big merchants who hope that Shanghai's commerce will continue as usual when the US and Japan go to war. They believe that the assets of Japanese residents in Shanghai are so huge that they can become a constraint on military action. They quote a famous Japanese merchant as saying: "Japan absolutely does not need 'another Zhabei, only broken walls.'" However, those who harbor this hope ignore the point that if the Pacific War breaks out, it will isolate Shanghai from the sphere of influence of the United States and Britain; the Japanese will therefore lose all their interests, and this interest once kept a powerful faction among the Japanese who were happy to maintain the city's international trade, just like the current semi-state.</p>
<p>To think that even though the Japanese and American naval and air forces are fighting in the Pacific, the British and American expatriates in Shanghai will still be allowed to reside here and conduct daily trade under the nose of the Japanese is completely delusional. The outbreak of war between Japan and the United States will undoubtedly result in the immediate seizure and liquidation of all enemy property and businesses within Japan's sphere of influence—including Shanghai. An open war will end all economic and financial plans of nationals of democratic countries in the hands of the Japanese. Because they will have nothing and no one to do business with anymore. They will probably be in Japanese concentration camps. There is no need to have any doubts about this.</p>
<p>If an open war between Japan and the United States does not break out soon, then Western business in this port or other places under Japanese influence may still tend to "paralysis." If the democratic countries' retaliation against Japan is not an open war, it will be an economic and financial war. In this regard, the capabilities and opportunities of democratic countries have not been completely exhausted. Although the freezing and control of trade against Japan has been completed, the licensed trade still allows the maintenance of the actual trade between the British, American, Dutch, Indian, and Far East Axis regions under this strategy that is only formally prohibited.</p>
<p>However, the continuation of this licensed trade is not obtained based on any articles or agreements, nor is there any diplomatic guarantee. If Japan makes another mistake and another mistake, then this licensed trade can be suspended at any time. Before the situation evolves into an open war, it may reach an intermediate stage, that is, completely sever all economic relations with Japan.</p>
<p>Only if Japan begins to act somewhat more rationally than in the past will the UK, the US, and the Dutch East Indies have the opportunity to take some steps under the current freezing and embargo regulations to allow limited continuation of trade with various places within Japan's sphere of influence. But even this approach would be very difficult. The opinions of the democratic countries and Japan on this trade are fundamentally different. Obviously, the former does not want to supply Japan with goods that can be used for combat and help Japan complete its armaments. And Japan's intention is equally clear: it wants to take more exports from Japanese-occupied areas in exchange for war supplies. These two completely opposite concepts are almost in conflict; if some agreement can be reached, then the inability to satisfy both parties at the same time may shrink trade to a smaller extent than is now hoped for under the new freeze and embargo.</p>
<p>The weather conditions in the Far East in recent weeks will determine the trade in the Far East in the coming months. Food is now the most important commodity in the Far East trade structure. The import and export situation of rice in 1941-42 has a great impact on all other aspects of trade. The weather conditions at this time of year have a decisive effect on the grain harvest, especially the rice harvest, which is extremely important for the economies of Japan, Korea, Central China, South China, and French Indochina.</p>
<p>Japanese officials expect this year's rice production to be 5% lower than last year, and Korea is normal, but it is still too early to determine the final harvest. The recent typhoons have caused heavy damage to Japanese crops, which the government's harvest forecasters did not expect. If Japan and Korea have a shortfall of 1,500,000 tons of rice, Tokyo will continue to ask the Yangtze River basin and Vietnam for rice supplies; on the other hand, if Japan's need to import rice decreases, the various places in the Far East will immediately feel the easing of Japan's control over rice. If Japan's harvest is satisfactory, the people under Japanese rule will be able to eat more relatively cheap food, Tokyo's distribution system can also be relaxed slightly, and the difficulties of navigation can also be slightly alleviated.</p>
<p>The sufficient supply of cargo ships is also a major problem in the Far East. The restrictions on ships coming and going through the United States have gradually increased, but recently, this has only sometimes delayed the time of cargo transportation and has not reduced the amount of cargo stranded. On the other hand, the freight of cotton and coal coming here from India has decreased greatly in the past few months, and sometimes it is temporarily interrupted.</p>
<p>Since the First World War, maritime shipping in the Far East has never been more dependent on Japan than it is now; Japan's commercial shipping is reduced by the mobilization of ships by the navy for military use. Currently, about one-third of Japan's commercial ships are carrying military supplies in China and Vietnam. The British are continuing to withdraw merchant ships from the Far East, and the United States' shipping is only expanding southward to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. It also seems not impossible for the United States to stop shipping to Shanghai early.</p>
<p>The general outlook, of course, does not fail to cause people to have doubts. A public economic war between Japan and Britain and America may be avoided. Many economic and financial problems can be solved with economic and financial methods; but even the best solutions will ultimately be ineffective if the warmongers in Tokyo prevail.

<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of one-yuan banknotes and one-cent, five-cent, dime, and two-dime subsidiary currency notes, causing inconvenience for change-making in various industries. It is heard that hospital banknotes are being sold at a premium of about eight to nine yuan per thousand yuan, and dime notes are only exchanged for ninety-five cents per yuan. In order to facilitate passengers, the British-owned Public Bus Company has specially converted the previously printed green two-cent substitute coupons into five-cent coupons for circulation on vehicles. The effective period of the coupons is until the end of December this year. ( )</p>

<p>The New York cotton market is firm and active, rising due to purchases by the industry and the good spot market. As a result, both futures and spot prices rose by eight to fifteen points per pound respectively compared with the previous day.</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and spot traders, then fell slightly due to sales by professional brokers, and finally rose again due to purchases by the public. As a result, all brands rose by one to five rupees and twenty-five points respectively compared with the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the opening forecast for Indian cotton today is that various stocks will continue to rise by 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Hardware Transactions Sluggish <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Recently, transactions in hardware have been sluggish because the source of overseas supplies has been cut off, and merchants from the north, such as Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yangtze River Road, and inland river merchants, have been prohibited from exporting. There is nothing to say about destocking, so the market atmosphere is difficult to see lively. And the street sales in this port are also very sluggish, so the number of transactions is few throughout the day. At present, the spot goods on the market, such as foreign nails, are being sold out in large quantities because the hoarding merchants are eager to sell them, resulting in a large number of circulating goods and difficulty in raising prices. And the acceptance by users is very minimal, so those who hold goods have softened their minds. Yesterday, double nails were rarely seen opening at around 185 yuan per barrel. In addition, guild iron, plain white iron, foreign ingot heads, tinplate, and black iron billets are also very sluggish in transactions.</p>

<p>The soap market is trending firm again because the Arrow Knife Soap Company has raised its prices again, claiming that the raw materials and products are not enough to cover the costs, so the factory has no goods to distribute, causing those who hold goods to raise their prices again, and people's minds are showing firmness and bullishness again, causing the market to prosper. It is estimated that Solid Brand soap is 64 yuan per case, Bai Xiangmao soap is 53 yuan, and Huang Xiang soap is 49.6 yuan, all up two yuan from the previous day.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of autumn, fresh fruits and seasonal products, and various kinds of pears, have been launched on the market one after another. More than 2,000 pieces of Tianjin elegant pears and falling pears have been newly shipped by train, and the selling price is easing. The opening price of elegant pears is 70 yuan per 100 catties, and the falling pears are 50 yuan. There are also Yantai foreign pears with a price of 100 yuan. Yantai apples have also been shipped. New apples (tree-wrapped) are 100 yuan to 80 yuan per 100 catties, banana apples are 100 yuan, colored apples are 120 yuan, and Yantai big fresh fruits are 70 yuan, all falling back from the previous agreement. Only Florida tangerines are famous and expensive, with more than 100 pieces packed in each box, and the price is 140 yuan, requiring more than one yuan per piece. It is also heard that Hangzhou persimmons have already been launched on the market. Copper basin persimmons are 100 yuan, and ordinary shipments are 80 yuan to early prices on the market, and easing has already been seen. (Zhang)</p>

<p>The cigarette market has been slightly weak recently because the factory has passed down the news that there will be goods to distribute soon, which has softened people's minds, and sales have not been prosperous.

<h3 id="e37">Shanghai-Germany Trade at a Standstill; Dalian Transshipments Greatly Reduced; Pre-Soviet-German War Orders Still Being Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Economic expert Mr. Allers published an article yesterday entitled "The Soviet-German War and Shanghai Trade." Here is a translation: "Since news of the Soviet-German war reached Shanghai, the general opinion has naturally been that Far East trade with Germany has come to an end. As a result, another large portion of trade in this port has been forced to grind to a halt. However, the extent of the damage suffered by Shanghai trade cannot be immediately known, as there have never been clear statistics on the quantity and value of goods shipped to Germany via Dalian and Siberia. Now that the Customs has published its foreign trade report for July, we may as well try to examine this issue.</p>
<p>Shanghai Goods Shipped to Germany Via Dalian</p>
<p>As the European war entered its second year, trade through Siberia by totalitarian nations gradually expanded. As a result, the amount of goods imported to Dalian from Shanghai greatly increased. At the same time, Dalian became a transshipment port for trade between Germany and the Far East. However, the quantity of goods imported from Shanghai to the Japanese-controlled Kwantung Leased Territory and the Northeast also increased accordingly. Therefore, it is naturally intricate and difficult to determine how much of the increased exports from Shanghai to Dalian were imported into Germany and how much remained in the Japanese-controlled areas. This confusing situation made it easy for the Japanese to believe that a large quantity of goods was being transported to Germany via Dalian.</p>
<p>After the Soviet-German War, Flowing Elsewhere</p>
<p>Comparing Shanghai's exports to Dalian in June and July may provide a new explanation for this issue. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war at the end of June, goods shipped from Shanghai to Dalian for import into Germany via Siberia have ceased. However, on the other hand, goods destined for the Kwantung Leased Territory and the Northeast are still being shipped as usual. Therefore, it seems reasonable to say that the large decrease in Shanghai's imports to Dalian in July compared to the previous month of June is due to the flow of exports to Germany going elsewhere. In fact, the export trade of these reduced items seems sufficient to indicate the approximate value of goods imported into Germany from Shanghai via Dalian up to June.</p>
<p>Significant Drop in Recent Months</p>
<p>Shanghai's exports to Dalian in July dropped significantly compared to June. According to official estimates, the value of these exports in June was no less than 35,400,000 yuan, nearly 20 percent of Shanghai's total exports. However, the value of exports in July is estimated to be only 16,102,503 yuan, less than 9 percent of the port's total exports. This means that the value of these exports in July decreased by 19,300,000 yuan compared to the previous month, accounting for a full two-thirds of the total decrease in Shanghai's exports in July.</p>
<p>Flour and Oil Actually Increased</p>
<p>Furthermore, the amount of flour imported from Shanghai to Dalian in July was 3,000,000 yuan, and vegetable oil was 2,500,000 yuan. These two figures not only did not decrease compared to June but also slightly increased, which is quite intriguing. As far as these two commodities are concerned, Dalian was clearly not being used as a transshipment port for Germany. It was only because of crop failures in various parts of the Northeast last year that flour and cooking oil had to be imported to meet their needs. However, the value of other goods imported from Shanghai to Dalian in July generally decreased sharply compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>German Dyes Swarming to Shanghai</p>
<p>On the other hand, German imports to Shanghai did not decrease in July, but rather increased sharply. This is because when the Soviet-German war broke out, large quantities of German goods being transshipped via Siberia had already crossed the Soviet border twice and continued to be transported to Shanghai from Japanese-controlled areas. Therefore, German dye imports to Shanghai in July increased sharply from 716,000 yuan in June to 1,142,000 yuan, accounting for 70 percent of the port's total dye imports. At the same time, German chemicals and pharmaceuticals imported to the port increased from 162,000 yuan to 429,000 yuan. However, the future situation of this increase in German goods cannot yet be predicted.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Linked Responsibility System for Approved Foreign Exchange If Recalled; Handling Bank Responsible to the Exchange Stabilization Fund; Importer Responsible to the Handling Bank <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Control Measures, all Allied banks have received orders from the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to implement them uniformly from September 6th. For foreign exchange for essential goods imports, the Exchange Stabilization Fund's rate of 9.34375 yuan for US dollars or 3 pence 1875 for British pounds, less a commission of 0.03125, will be provided. However, the application procedures are extremely strict, and the handling bank must bear full responsibility to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Therefore, the implementation steps are quite thorough. According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's inquiry to related banks, each designated bank has already notified its customers of the settlement method and other details, so that everyone knows and can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Allied Banks' Announcement Contents</p>
<p>Allied banks are issuing a special announcement to relevant clients regarding the settlement of foreign exchange for essential goods. It states: "Attached are five copies of the foreign exchange application form. Those who need to apply for Chinese legal currency foreign exchange must fill in items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the form and fill out five copies according to the format. The last copy must be formally signed and sealed by the importer applying for foreign exchange. Application procedures can be conducted by telegraph or letter. Although the Exchange Stabilization Fund may approve upon receipt of the application telegram, it must still be based on the application form. If it is deemed that the application form has obvious discrepancies and the telegram application has already been approved, the original handling bank may be ordered to return the settled exchange. Under these circumstances, the original applicant importer must be responsible to the original handling bank and must repay the settled foreign exchange or replenish it from the black market. The importer shall bear the loss of the difference between the black market exchange rate and the Exchange Stabilization Fund exchange rate."</p>
<p>Importers Must Also Provide Guarantees</p>
<p>The above announcement to customers indicates that in order to avoid unknown losses, banks may require importers to provide appropriate guarantees when requesting the bank to apply for foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, just like the guarantees provided by the handling bank to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. According to the written guarantee provided by the bank to the Exchange Stabilization Fund, see item 10 in the application form: "Our bank hereby proves, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that all the items filled in above are completely accurate. The imported goods described here are in accordance with the conditions agreed upon in our bank's application form No. XXX on Month XXX, Day XXX. If the Exchange Stabilization Fund finds that the imported goods described here are not in accordance with those described in the application form, our bank is willing to sell back to the Exchange Stabilization Fund the foreign exchange obtained from the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the supply of entry products at the exchange rate at the time of purchase. In order to guarantee the accuracy of what is stated here, our bank is willing to provide the Exchange Stabilization Fund with such written evidence as the Fund deems necessary." The guarantee that the importer should provide to the bank is also of this nature, the only difference being that one is the bank's guarantee to the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the other is the importer's guarantee to the bank.</p>
<p>Plenary Meeting Held in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The current settlement method for essential goods implemented by various banks is the result of the preliminary meeting of the Hong Kong Exchange Stabilization Committee. The second plenary meeting of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will be held at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong in the coming days. American committee member Mr. Fox has already returned to Hong Kong from the Philippines yesterday. It is estimated that at least nine people will participate in this meeting, including Chen Guangfu, Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, Fox, Taylor, Holbartu, and other chairmen and committee members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. In addition, Mr. Hawkins, manager of the Shanghai bank McGillicuddy, and Mr. Mackay, manager of Citibank, will also be present as representatives of the Shanghai bank. Others include Mr. Adler, the representative managing the frozen funds in the Philippines. It is believed that the agenda of the formal meeting of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not be limited to the Shanghai exchange market issue. Other matters related to the freezing of funds, the basis of legal currency, and commodity prices will also be discussed. The overall results will be seen this week.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Eurasia Aviation Corporation Opens Hong Kong-Shaoguan Line; One-Way Fare is HK$270 <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate transportation, Eurasia Aviation Corporation has opened a new route from Hong Kong to Shaoguan (i.e., Qujiang). The trial flight was successful on the 30th of last month. Mr. Li Jingcong, the manager of the company, personally inspected the flight and was satisfied. It will be officially launched after Nanxiong informs that the construction is completed. The line is decided to be called Hong Kong-Shaoguan Line, flying from Hong Kong directly to Nanxiong. From Nanxiong onwards to Shaoguan by land, the company will not be responsible. In terms of cost, the passenger fare is HK$270 per person one way, and the cargo transportation fee is HK$3.7 per kilogram. According to the New Voice News Agency, the company was initially a Sino-German joint venture, and some of the aircraft were piloted by German pilots. However, in the past three years, they have been replaced by Chinese pilots. To date, there are no foreign flight personnel in the entire company, which can be said to be a completely state-run airline.</p>

<p>In order to rectify the cleanliness and safety of public rickshaws within the concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented a strict inspection operation in August. Vehicles that were old, dilapidated, or unusable were confiscated. A total of 200 vehicles were confiscated last month. It is now stipulated that the license must be obtained by the 6th of each month at the latest, otherwise the license will be refused. As for the rickshaw rental fee, the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the price increase on July 10 after a long-term request from rickshaw owners. However, in recent times, the prices of hardware, rubber, and other materials have continued to soar, and the original rental fee is insufficient to maintain the business. Therefore, the industry association has requested its members to complete the price investigation of materials and submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting to increase the rental fee by 50% in accordance with the precedents of other public vehicles in order to maintain their livelihood.</p>

<p>A tragedy occurred on Suzhou Creek yesterday morning. A small steamboat named Wanyu, located on the south bank of Suzhou Creek under the Tianhou Temple Bridge, had just been towed from the South Pier of the South City with four barges full of firewood and straw. When it was towed to the location at 8:20 yesterday morning, before it could moor, the boiler in the cabin suddenly exploded due to excessive heat. With a loud noise, the entire wheel was shattered. Three stokers in the cabin were killed on the spot, and three captains on the deck were also injured in the explosion. During the explosion, the wheel's chimney flew over to the roof of house number 398, Lane 400, Beijing Road, penetrated the roof, and fell into a room on the second floor, injuring a 12-year-old girl named Dai Jinmei and a 9-year-old boy named Dai Azong, and killing a two-sentence male of one year. Afterwards, they were sent to Renji Hospital and the coroner's office for treatment and inspection. It was also learned that the windows in the surrounding area were shattered by the explosion, which shows the magnitude of the blast. The ship's hull was damaged and soon sank into the water. After the Water Patrol Police received the news, they urgently dispatched a small wheel to the scene and temporarily cut off traffic near the accident site. It was not restored until after 9:00. The four barges towed by the wheel were intact and not affected.</p>

<h3 id="e51">General Manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory Wu Zhesheng Was Kidnapped Yesterday; 11 Kidnappers in Two Cars; One Car Found <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>At 7:11 yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred in Hua'anfang, Lane 1088, Xujiahui Road, French Concession. The kidnapped person was Wu Zhesheng, general manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory. A total of 11 kidnappers went in two black-plated cars. The situation that has been detected is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Gate Control</p>
<p>Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory is a giant of rubber factories in the city. The factory's general headquarters is located at No. 24, Lane 63, Dongqipan Street to No. 24, Lane 13. There is also a distribution office at No. 6, Lane 15, Jiangxi Road. Its first factory is located at No. 1102, Xujiahui Road, manufacturing various tires and galoshes. The scale is very large, employing more than 1,200 workers, and the business is quite developed. The general manager is Wu Zhesheng from Nanjing. He lives at No. 11 and No. 12, Hua'anfang, Lane 1088, next to the first factory. The gate control of the lane is strict, with two Sikh constables rotating day and night to guard it. Wu has a Shanghai Municipal Council car license No. 7963.</p>
<p>Forced the Gatekeeper</p>
<p>At about 7:00 yesterday morning, 11 bandits, 6 of whom were holding pistols, arrived at the entrance of Hua'anfang in two Shanghai Municipal Council black-plated car license Nos. 2235 and 3724. They jumped down and 5 of them guarded the entrance to keep watch, while the remaining 6 forced the day-shift gatekeeper with weapons, not allowing him to speak out, and took the bullets from the cylinder of his public duty pistol. They then forced him to lead them to No. 11 of the lane. They first knocked on Wu's back door, pretending to have something to look for Mr. Wu. The maid of Wu's house opened the door to greet them.</p>
<p>Forcibly Taken Away</p>
<p>At this time, the bandits forced the maid to lead 3 of the bandits to Wu's bedroom on the second floor. The remaining 3 bandits guarded the front and back doors separately. At that time, Wu and his wife, Mrs. Yang, were still in bed. Wu woke up startled when he heard the noise and was about to leave the room to investigate when he ran into the bandits. One of the bandits fired a shot to demonstrate his power. The bullet hit the floorboard under the bed. Without asking any questions, Wu was forcibly dragged away. Wu asked the bandits to allow him to change his clothes because he was wearing pajamas, but the bandits refused. They immediately dragged Wu downstairs and, together with the bandits guarding the front and back doors, left together. Wu was then kidnapped into the bandit vehicle and drove west quickly.</p>
<p>Bandit Vehicle Found</p>
<p>At about 10:00 yesterday morning, one of the bandit vehicles, No. 2235, was found at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Daxilu. However, there was no one in the car. Both cars were stolen by the bandits. Since Wu Zhesheng was kidnapped, there has been no news as of last night. The French Concession Police are currently trying to rescue him.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Letter <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor, This is to inform you that according to Xie Hao, the manager of Zhenyuan Fine Dyeing Company, he recently read a news item in the local section of your newspaper on the 5th about a bomb being found in Zhenyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. No. 11, Lane 172, Arlabaster Road, is only the location of our company, and there is no Zhenyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Moreover, our company has always treated its workers very generously, so labor and management have always been harmonious, and there have been no complaints so far. The report in your newspaper is presumably a rumor that is inaccurate. As this concerns our company's brand name, we are sincerely afraid of affecting our business reputation and confusing workers' hearing, so it is difficult to remain silent. Please issue a letter to clarify and correct the record. Lawyer Chen Kunyuan.</p>

<p>According to shipping industry sources, in order to strengthen the shipping and transportation capabilities of the Far East, the Soviet government intends to adjust the routes of the ships stranded in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Manila, dividing them into two lines: Hong Kong to Vladivostok, and the Dutch East Indies and Australian Sydney to Vladivostok. It is now heard that the Soviet shipping agencies in various locations have issued orders to all ships to prepare as soon as possible to strengthen the Vladivostok transportation line. According to reports, the Soviet ships currently undergoing repairs in Shanghai shipyards include Soviet (2,76x tons), Food Industry (10,078 tons), and Ke Fuda (2,763 tons). There are also three ships, including Molotov, undergoing repairs at the Taikoo Shipyard in Hong Kong, and three ships, including Volkohuo, in the Philippines. The Soviet ships stranded in Hong Kong are all preparing to wait for export orders but will not come to Shanghai Bay to avoid delaying the mission.</p>

<p>(Guilin Correspondence) The population of Guilin City has increased sharply in recent years, and the number of students in primary and secondary schools has also increased accordingly. The original schools are insufficient to accommodate them, especially primary schools. As the autumn semester begins this year, this phenomenon of school shortage has occurred again. Yesterday, the reporter specifically interviewed Qin Changqi, the chief of the Education Section of the Municipal Government, to inquire about solutions. According to him, Guilin City had a population of only about 50,000 people 27 years ago, and the existing schools were sufficient at that time. Since the outbreak of the war and the relocation of the provincial capital to Guilin, the population has gradually increased, and the schools have gradually become insufficient. The provincial government allocated 100,000 yuan, and the local government raised another 100,000 yuan, with the standard that Guilin City's population reached 100,000. Six Zhen Central Schools were built, including Bagui, Bailong, Yinan, and Dongjiang schools. Each school must open at least 24 classes, and it is planned to continue building Fengbei, Peifeng and other Zhen Central Schools. At this time, Guilin City was continuously bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing the completed central schools and major affiliated rural primary schools to be occupied by government agencies, preventing schools from opening. The population of Guilin City has now reached 280,000. Due to these reasons, the schools are not enough to accommodate students, which is an inevitable fact. According to statistics in May this year, about 10,000 primary school students in the city were unable to attend school and were stranded at home. Education is the foundation of the country, and the occurrence of this phenomenon has a significant impact on the future of the country. Therefore, the municipal government has actively sought solutions to this problem during the summer vacation this year. The following temporary measures have been decided: 1. To accurately count the number of school-age children in the city, a unified entrance examination for primary school students will be held on the 25th in each school. 2. Senior primary school students should pay attention to their physical and mental health and strictly assess their academic performance. Qualified students should be evenly distributed to various schools to avoid uneven distribution. 3. Senior primary schools should stipulate that each class should accommodate at least 50 students. 4. Primary schools should give priority to accommodating school-age children as much as possible without exceeding the quota. 5. If the number of students in each junior primary school is too large, a two-part teaching system should be implemented. 6. Increase the salaries of primary school teachers, stipulating from 75 yuan to 150 or 60 yuan. Schools that implement the two-part teaching system should also hire more teachers to teach classes.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Weekly" has been around for three years since it first met its readers. It has made some small contributions to the four essential elements of life. However, now we must bid farewell to our readers. This is not to say that we are so severely threatened by clothing, food, housing, and transportation that we can henceforth live without clothing, food, housing, or transportation, becoming earthly immortals. It is because in this great era, life has countless threads, and one cannot simply focus on personal clothing, food, housing, and transportation to solve everything. Expanding from the individual, there is the family. The scope of the family is larger, and the issues that can be discussed and studied are more numerous and complex. Therefore, starting today, the "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Weekly" will be changed to the "Family Weekly." Recalling the ancient saying that "when the family is in order, the state will be governed," the birth of this "Family Weekly" seems not to be without significance.</p>
<p>Generally, people have different views on the family. Some think the family is a burden, others think marriage is a foolish act, and still others think there is nothing to discuss within the family. As a result, many people do not study the organization and management of the family, let alone improve it. However, not to mention the existing family structure, the number of young men and women marrying is increasing day by day. They do not know what married life is, what family economics are. Relying on their limited knowledge, they handle things arbitrarily. Isn't it difficult to achieve satisfactory results?</p>
<p>We don't need to discuss whether the family is ultimately necessary for social organization. Since everyone has a family, if we can improve it through discussion, positively speaking, we can make the family organization more sound and social order more orderly. Negatively speaking, family expenses can be greatly reduced through planned consumption, and family life can avoid unnecessary disputes because of the conditions of mutual love, loyalty, and honesty between husband and wife. Therefore, family issues are worth discussing, and family management methods are worth studying.</p>
<p>However, this is not an easy task that yields quick results. It requires considerable time and continuous effort. In the future, the articles published in this journal will focus on practicality, supplemented by interest, with the overarching premise of enabling ordinary families to live a rational life. We firmly believe that with the efforts of our readers, their constant contributions of ideas, and cooperative conditions, we can certainly achieve considerable success.</p>

<p>The flowers embroidered on pillowcases are indeed very elaborate. If they are too vulgar, they can affect the owner's status. Embroidering a few foreign words seems a bit unnatural. Here is a border pattern that seems reproducible, with all kinds of flowers. You only need to enlarge it. If you particularly like a certain flower, you may want to draw it larger and use the other flowers as a foil. Why not try it right away?</p>

<h3 id="e72">A Major Problem in Chinese Families—Child Rearing <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Kemei</p>
<p>When it comes to the improvement of Chinese families, there are too many problems. This is a natural phenomenon during any social change, especially in a country with a long history and a family system that has remained unchanged for thousands of years. Encountering an unprecedented global transformation—the eastward spread of Western culture—is simply overwhelming, and everything becomes a problem. Therefore, discussing Chinese family problems is truly a complex and daunting task. Here, I would like to mention one of the biggest and most important problems first and ask everyone to pay attention to it. This problem is the raising of children.</p>
<p>The importance of child rearing seems self-evident in China because China has always emphasized the concept of descendants, valuing children, and emphasizing "incense." The saying goes, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest." However, strangely enough, Chinese people only want to have children, not healthy and lively children. They only want many children, not good children. They only emphasize quantity and not quality. This kind of attitude is like that of lower organisms, which reproduce in large numbers to ensure that some survive, which is also a preparation for many deaths. Therefore, "the louse becomes a grandmother in three days." However, the most wasteful thing in the universe is nothing more than this. The reason why lower organisms remain lower organisms forever lies in this completely blind waste. However, the lives of lower organisms are much simpler, and reproduction and rearing are much easier. They can afford this kind of waste. But human life is so complex, childbirth is so difficult, and rearing is so costly and laborious that we cannot afford this kind of waste. Therefore, the Chinese attitude of emphasizing quantity over quality is completely wrong and should be improved immediately. Otherwise, not only will our children's lives be like the cicadas that live only until dusk, but their lives will also be like the stupid and filthy deer and pigs. From an individual point of view, what value does life have? What fun is there in life? From the perspective of the nation, what competitive ability do people with short lifespans and dull minds have? What possibility is there for survival? Even if they勉强survive, they will only be used by others as beasts of burden.</p>
<p>Therefore, the importance of child rearing, on a small scale, is related to individual happiness. On a large scale, it is related to the survival of the nation. From the perspective of the family, child rearing must be carried out in the family. Therefore, the family bears the dual responsibility of individual happiness and national survival. Therefore, no family problem is as important as child rearing.</p>

<p>— Wan Qiuhong</p>
<p>At the beginning of autumn, ordinary families should think about the issue of window decoration, because in the coming months, the windows will be closed more often. Therefore, they have to think about how to put some decorations on the glass.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make curtains. The style on the upper left of the picture is very common and suitable for long windows. Even shorter windows can use this style, as long as the shape of the window is rectangular.</p>
<p>The second and third methods are relatively novel. The one on the left can make narrow and long windows appear wider, and the one below can make low and short windows appear wider. As for the materials used, you can use cloth, silk, or yarn according to your own preferences. In terms of color, it is best to be harmonious with the color of the walls or furniture.</p>

<p>— Lu Yu (Draft)</p>
<p>Ingredients... Bean curd dregs cakes, pork, soy oil, cooking wine, fine salt, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, refined white water chestnut flour</p>
<p>Preparation... First chop the pork into fine pieces, add a little cooking wine, salt, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, etc., and mix well with chopsticks. Use a knife to slice open the bean curd dregs cakes, but only slice them halfway through, not all the way. Mix the water chestnut flour with cold water to form a paste. Then gently embed the minced meat into the bean curd dregs cakes. At any time, use water chestnut flour to seal the slits that were cut. At the same time, heat an appropriate amount of soy oil until boiling. Then put the bean curd dregs cakes in and fry until both sides are yellow. This cake is loose and crispy and is a good dish for drinking and eating with rice. Bean curd dregs cakes are sold in small vegetable markets. They are made from bean curd dregs, about the size of a large copper coin, about two or three cents thick. It would be even better if they were the size of a silver coin.</p>

<p>I remember that in Mr. Qian Yunhe's solo exhibition last year, there was a painting of hyacinth beans, painted very meticulously. Mr. Shou Juan wrote a poem on it, with the line "Autumn scenery is no less beautiful than spring, enchanting the hyacinth bean flowers by the fence," which left a deep impression on me. I often recite it idly, because I love to eat hyacinth beans very much. Although hyacinth beans have been on the market for more than a month, they are still very tender and can be eaten. For a meat dish, you can stir-fry it with sliced meat and edamame, which is rich and delicious. If you want to eat vegetarian, then just add some dried tofu strips. If you add some sweet sauce, that would be even better.</p>

<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jiluan devoted his life to the newspaper industry, serving the country with his articles, upholding the truth, and being a model of integrity. His sincerity and passion were worthy of emulation by young people.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Zhang has unfortunately passed away, a giant star has fallen in the newspaper industry, and scholars have lost a teacher. I still remember that five years ago, on Mr. Zhang's fiftieth birthday, Mr. Yu Youren gave him a poem that included "Doing things for others every day, thinking of the country's difficulties at all times, entrusting his heroic feelings to Kunqu opera, defending the Divine Land with his pen."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's words and deeds are recorded in history. What we mourn about Mr. Zhang today is only the phrase "with a calm mind and passionate feelings." Only those who have accumulated virtue and can write articles like Mr. Zhang can achieve this. Although Mr. Zhang has passed away, his passion is radiant and will be remembered forever.</p>
<h3 id="e78">A Warning to Students Selected for Scholarship Assistance <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— An Anonymous Old Man</p>
<p>An anonymous old man, alias "A Pitiful Man of the World." This newspaper launched a scholarship assistance campaign, and the old man warmly supported it by providing 2,000 yuan to subsidize the tuition fees of 50 students of all levels in primary and secondary schools. His noble heart is a model for all. This man also admitted that he is nearly sixty years old, and his days are numbered. He runs a small business with limited capacity and is willing to do his best to provide a little help. If he is still alive next semester and his business does not change suddenly, he will continue to provide assistance. (See this newspaper on August 10 for the original letter.) Now we have obtained the old man's handwriting, which is more precious than treasure, and we are publishing it urgently, hoping to encourage all hardworking students in society. (Editor's note)</p>
<p>I admire the enthusiasm of the gentlemen who initiated the reader scholarship assistance fund in the Shenbao and deeply feel the pain of young people who cannot afford to go to school. Therefore, I have done my best to contribute my meager savings. I am extremely ashamed that the editor of the Shenbao praised me too much in the editorial on the 21st of last month! I will tell the selected students about my own experiences as a lesson from the past.</p>
<p>I lost my parents when I was young, and my family was destitute. Although my brother was a scholar, his income from teaching was very meager. Therefore, at the age of seventeen, I was forced to drop out of school. Driven by hunger and cold, I had no choice but to leave home to find work. Suppressing my eagerness to learn, I tearfully walked a hundred miles to a mountain village and became an apprentice in a grocery store. The store owner was not wealthy, and adding an apprentice was already too much of a burden.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was responsible for carrying firewood, fetching water, washing clothes, and cooking. Moreover, each meal was limited to two bowls. Adding more would incur the store owner's contemptuous looks. I swallowed the food of humiliation with tears, which led to stomach problems that became more severe in my prime. The store owner was extremely frugal and did not light lamps in the evening. Moreover, there was nothing to read in the countryside. I occasionally borrowed two letters of the Qiu Shui Xuan Xue Hong Xuan from the owner of the neighboring oil store and pondered them every night by moonlight. I also practiced abacus calculations, ignoring the mosquitoes gathering on my back in the hot summer. I never stopped learning. The neighbor told the store owner that I was so diligent in my studies that I would surely make a name for myself in the future, and he should treat me well. A year later, I finally earned a monthly salary of eight jiao, which allowed me to wear a lined jacket in winter, but I still had no mosquito net in summer. The hardship was beyond words. At the age of twenty, a friend of my brother introduced me to work as a bookkeeper in a cloth shop in Yuyao, with a monthly salary of only three yuan, which was already considered exceptional. Three years later, I carried a broken quilt and a few jiao to Shanghai to take the recruitment exam for a bookstore. I was selected as the second-best in abacus calculation and received a monthly salary of fourteen yuan. I walked to work and spent no money. At the age of twenty-five, I buried my ancestors. At the age of twenty-seven, I married. I thought that living under someone else's roof was not a long-term plan, so I set up a book stall on Fuzhou Road. It has been more than twenty years since then. I have been half-merchant and half-scholar. Although I have no time to rest, I never forget my books. This is how I have achieved what I have today. In recent years, my temples have turned gray, and I have a little surplus, but I donate most of it to relatives and friends in need and charitable organizations. Therefore, I am still as poor as before. I never record the names of the donors, because I do not want to use this money to seek fame and reputation. Now, the students are forced by circumstances and have the ambition to study but not the ability to do so. Fortunately, they have received assistance and can go to school. This is a rare opportunity. Emperor Taizong of Tang said, "When I was eighteen years old, I was still among the people and knew their hardships. Therefore, I was able to achieve the Zhenguan era, which was comparable to the rule of Cheng and Kang." During the Jin Dynasty, the people were malnourished, and Emperor Hui asked, "Why don't they eat meat porridge?" This led to the chaos of the Five Dynasties and the humiliation of the Qingyi. The sage said, "Heaven will bestow great responsibility on this person, and he must first suffer his mind, strain his muscles." The students have better opportunities than I did. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of reading diligently in cold and hot weather and become pillars of the country and mentors of society in the future. Remember the exhortations of the Shenbao editorial writer that although you are receiving assistance from society today, you will be able to repay society in the future. Then it will not only be the luck of one person, but society and the country will also benefit from it. Students, strive!</p>
<h3 id="e79">Shanghai's Used Book Industry <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Zuishi</p>
<p>No one can deny that books are the most important source of spiritual nourishment in life. I have always loved reading, but unfortunately, in this era of high prices and soaring book prices, I am forced to often go hungry for reading due to economic pressure. In this suffocating atmosphere of the isolated island, not being able to obtain adequate spiritual nourishment is indeed a very regrettable thing, but regret is still regret, and it cannot satisfy the desire to read. Running to the library, it is difficult to get to good things, and even if you borrow them, it is impossible to fully understand the content of a book in a short time, so I have fallen in love with old books. Although they are "ragged on the outside," their content has not diminished, and they can be called "gold and jade within." Therefore, I often visit various used bookstores in my spare time to find books I love at low prices, and I can often "get what I want." Once a book is out of print in a new bookstore, there is no way to find it, but used bookstores can often discover it. Because of the "low price and many types," many people buy them, and the business of used bookstores is booming. Book stalls and bookstores are springing up like mushrooms after rain.</p>
<p>The distribution of used book stalls and bookstores in Shanghai is mainly concentrated in two areas: one is the middle section of Sima Road and Henan Road, and the other is Carter Road. There are also a few in the Puzhong Road, Lafayette Road, and Albert Road areas.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bookstore on Sima Road sells many types of books, but there do not seem to be many high-value books. Meihua Bookstore is similar to the above. Chunqiu Bookstore has fewer rare books, but the price is still fair. Chuanxin Bookstore mainly focuses on woodblock books, so there are very few new books. There are book stalls on Henan Road across from the Fire Brigade. There is a bookstore near the Commercial Press. The book stalls have a large number of books. Because they do not know the editions of Western books, there are many old editions. The Shanghai Used Bookstore near the Commercial Press has quite a few books, but there are more Western books than Chinese books, so the buyers are highly educated, and the prices are higher. They are willing to accept books that other stores dare not accept. This is true for Western books, and it is also true for Chinese books.</p>
<p>Now it is the beginning of the school season, and a group of students are busy running around used bookstores. I sincerely hope that all new and old bookstores will "greatly reduce prices" to help the isolated island with spiritual nourishment. I think the bookstore owners who have cultural responsibilities will definitely be able to sacrifice generously.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Common Sense of Industry and Commerce—Various Uses of Fluorescent Lamps <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Yidao</p>
<p>Fluorescence has a wide range of uses. Here are some of the main ones:</p>
<p>Because of its high luminous efficiency and energy saving, fluorescence has great benefits for industry and commerce. For example, in factories, starting with five lights worth of electricity, installing fluorescent lights is enough to supply thirty-five to sixty lights. This has a great impact on the speed and refinement of production. In department stores, hotels, and offices, installing fluorescent lamps can save more than 30% of electricity. In museums, there used to be no good way to display the rare and difficult-to-see aurora borealis to the public, but now fluorescence can be used to simulate the aurora borealis. As for fluorescent lamps suitable for residential use, although there are some shortcomings, engineers are now working on improving them. It is expected that a six-inch-long, half-inch-thick fluorescent lamp suitable for home use will soon appear.</p>
<p>In medicine, fluorescence can help doctors diagnose diseases, because under the scrutiny of a fluorescent microscope, each different microbe has a different special color. For example, tuberculosis bacteria are yellow, typhoid A bacteria are purple-yellow, typhoid B bacteria are green-yellow, cancer bacteria are cyan-violet, and the cells of healthy people are pure black.</p>
<p>Fluorescence can also solve criminal cases, especially cases of forged signatures. Because under ultraviolet light, different inks can emit different colors of fluorescence, so altering checks, documents, or stealing mail can all be detected using the principles of fluorescence. There is also a fluorescent powder that can be applied to banknotes or commodities. If they are stolen, the thief's hands will be stained with this powder, and his hands will reflect green light under the light. Also, butter and margarine are the same color in sunlight, but under ultraviolet light, margarine will emit blue fluorescence. Fresh eggs emit red fluorescence, but eggs stored for more than ten days emit red-ochre fluorescence, or even blue fluorescence. Using fluorescence, it is also possible to identify beets mixed in coffee or impure, poor-quality oils. Therefore, fluorescence is no different from a loud warning to unscrupulous merchants and their deceptive practices.</p>
<p>In military affairs, the use of fluorescence cannot be ignored. For example, the lights in the latest fighter jets are all fluorescent, which on the one hand can achieve the effect of not irritating the pilot's eyes, and on the other hand, there is no worry of being seen by the enemy. The entrances and exits of British underground air-raid shelters are coated with fluorescent powder to avoid the attention of enemy aircraft. Military terrain coated with this powder can be clearly displayed even in extremely dark places. There is also a beautiful method of using fluorescence to find tungsten ore seedlings, which is currently being tested.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Begonia <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Qingou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Troubles</p>
<p>"But as I see it, there's an eight out of ten chance it wasn't him, right?" Old Meng deliberately added a tail, indicating that he could not assume responsibility.</p>
<p>Little Gouzi was already following behind Begonia, about to step out of the circle of wooden counters built against the street. Hearing Old Shopkeeper Meng say this, he became very angry. He forgot the consequences for a moment and turned back to sneer at him.</p>
<p>"Ten out of ten, eight out of ten, that's something even gods can't say for sure!" He pretended to be talking to Chen Da, who was in the same trade, only raising his voice very high, intentionally wanting the people behind to hear. "But they have the ability to steal people, and we have the ability to find people. Let's see what they have to say when we find them!"</p>
<p>Begonia was busy turning back to wink at him, but Little Gouzi's words had already been spoken and could not be taken back.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Meng and his daughter-in-law heard this from behind, but did not reply. That Mrs. Meng, who didn't understand anything but loved to interfere, had nothing to say at all, while that Old Meng was deliberately unwilling to quarrel with Little Gouzi. He was just smiling coldly with a pipe in his mouth.</p>
<p>"With you, a countryman who has never seen the world, wanting to bring people back, you're still far from it!" He leaned his body against the counter, watching the backs of Begonia and the other two, thinking to himself.</p>
<p>This thought was indeed somewhat reasonable.</p>
<p>Although Little Gouzi had a bellyful of loyalty and wished he could risk his life to bring back Mei Bao, his ability and knowledge were ultimately too limited. The next day, although he took that Chen Da, the handyman of the county middle school, and rushed around in Zhangshu Village for a day, trying to recognize the person who had tricked Mei Bao away, how could things be so easy?
