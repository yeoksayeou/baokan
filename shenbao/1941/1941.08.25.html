<p>社評</p>
<p>美日間的談判</p>
<p>近一個月間、美日關係至少曾有過三度的緊張：七月二十六日美英宣布凍結日本資金，三十日日機在重慶炸傷美砲艦圖圖拉，以及最近日文阻止美方僑民乘柯里治號輪返國、都一度引起重大的波動、此外有如美英對泰國表示關切、美國禁止飛機油運日，羅邱共同宣言的發布、美國援蘇油船開赴海參崴，日文亦不斷嘵嘵作反對的表示。美日兩國關係，近頃方在繼續惡化之中，但是上述的幾度緊張，並未導引到更大衝突的爆發，反而率多化險為夷，在一度喧呶之後迅歸平靜。而在格魯與豐田，野村與赫爾之間，又復至今仍循着外交途徑進行談判。照一般的常識：暴風雨的前夜照例要有相當的寂靜，但今日美日之間的情勢却顯非此一見解所能解釋。</p>
<p>首先需要明瞭的是美國遠東政策的基本立塲。自史汀生不承認主義的揭布以至今日，其間經過無數變化和長期演進，其最近所表現的積極性大概為四年前孤立派熱力最形囂張之際所不曾夢見的，但其反侵略的精神始終一贯，其對中國的同情與對日本的抨擊戒備亦始終一贯。噹武漢廣州相繼淪陷之後，正是中國戰事最形不利的時節，美方且曾聯合英法各以嚴峻照會警吿日本，則當日主實力已見耗竭，且遠東反侵略陣綫勢力正當如日中天之際，如果說美國反會過分遷就侵略者，甚且僅以運用綏靖政策為能事，自屬不近事理。目前世人對美國遠東政策所尚感觖望者，不過以其步驟尚欠積極，制裁有失嚴密，以至尚未完全掌握主動而已。這些漏洞的存在，相信決非不是美當局的千慮一失，而到是出於有意的佈置，俾在日趨嚴峻之中稍替侵略者留有反省悔禍的餘地。在羅邱會談之後，對於危機四伏的遠東當已有縝密的研討，應變的決策，且遠東問題亦當為此度會談最主要任務之一，他日一旦有變，必能收指揮若定之效，不過在目前，美當局顯然還不準備比現行步驟更進一步。這一方面是基於美方一贯視歐局重於遠東的立塲，値此納粹兇焰仍開鴟張之際，自更以加緊支援英蘇為第一要圖；另一方面，則由於相信者這一利害休戚判然的形勢之下讓日本自身去抉擇，一定能使日本斂跡止步。同時這也就是美方還不拒絕繼續對日進行談判的原因。</p>
<p>至於日本，三數年來，一贯以緩和美國關係為對外政策的基點，其對此重視之殷，有時甚且過於對軸心的結託，在第二屆近衛內閣的後期，尤以對美外交視為中心任務。近衛新閣成立後，在行動上雖處處激怒美國，在政策上則處處緩和美國，有如對於凍結資金報復辦法的故示寬容，對於圖圖拉事件的迅速對美表示道歉賠償，對於撤僑糾紛的極力辯解並非扣留作質，且公然聲稱不願有任何動人聽聞的撤僑之舉以免引起美國人民的情緖，都表現着一種妥恊的企圖，而日大使野村之在美國，對此尤進行不遺餘力。加以日本南進之今雖殷，而在侵華戰爭失敗且無法結束之餘，如非時機十分有利，總不能不審愼避免另一戰爭的暴發，如日藏相小倉，即曾公開表示日本迄未處於有備無患可以激怒英美之地位。則只要外交途徑一天尚未完全堵塞，日方斷不肯輕易放棄從樽俎間獲致實利的企圖。</p>
<p>但是美日之間的立塲，只有雙方都不願立即爆發武裝衝突一點是相同的。如果接觸到實際問題，則美方所要求為脫離軸心，放棄侵略政策，不再北進南進；日本的希望則在於承認「新秩序」，停止援華，限制民治國在南洋的軍備，雙方南轅北轍，勢如冰炭。即使退一步講，雙方都不無讓步的可能，也距離成立妥恊尚遠。更何况兩國一貫國策，絕無絲毫相同的地方，如竟眞形成妥恊，也一定更比蘇德不侵恊定為脆弱，賢明如美當局，絕不致見不及此。</p>
<p>除却主觀原因而外，目前美日之所以尚能從事談判者，是由於國際形勢對日不利，美國則急於應付歐局，以是乃能使風濤險惡的太平洋在表面形成剎那間的安靜。倘若大局稍有變化——最主要的自然是蘇德戰爭——無論其為好轉抑或逆轉，則美日間這一暫吿的平衡有局面必然立吿傾欹，而遠東大局亦將有更明朗的開展。</p>

<h3 id="c23">西南空中的旅程　（一）　香港·重慶·昆明·腦戌 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>美國Collier's週報近載赫明威夫人所著空航一文，詳述自香港飛重慶，再由重慶而昆明以抵臘戌之途中見聞。作者文筆犀利，覩點準確，讀者自能領會，不再詞費。</p>
<p>風雨飛航</p>
<p>這是晨間四點半，旅客渡海至九龍飛機塲時，冷風刺骨。幾塲四邊澄火明威，你就可以望見銀色的陶格拉斯DC-2號機停在塲中，翼上漆了黑色大字，右翼是英文的CNAO，左翼是五呎見方中文字：中國航空公司。在機塲四周是三千呎高的綠山，但在黑暗中你不能見到什麼。八個棄客在無光的機艙中找到了自己的坐位，把安全縛身帶收緊了坐好。</p>
<p>氣候的預告說飛機司升高至五白呎，視度二百哩，前面有暴風雨。這對於中航機是很好的飛行氣候。美國航室綫上從來不准飛機在這種氣候上飛離四山團繞的機塲。我們開始起飛，機身在風中滑勤搖擺。我們將在夜間飛過日軍陣地，穿越有九千二百呎高的山脈。如因環境惡劣，要被迫降落，此地無平原可供降落之需。此去重慶計程七百七十哩。</p>
<p>飛機迥旋向上，在香港安全區域高高飛起。香港城市漸次變小，在我們下面成為一方新月形的島嶼。圍繞在港口四周的山上燈火閃爍。港內有燈光强烈的船隻，和民船上搖曳不定的星火。DC-2號機漸漸上升，城市中和水上的光芒變得傾斜和跳躍。於是香港在視綫中消失，飛機包圍在白色雲層中。華籍旅客蓋好氈子，靜靜地坐在椅中朦朧睡去。你可以聽到飛機向前推進的聲音，你可以聽得呼呼風聲。我們已升至香港上室一萬三千呎。機翼上的紅綠燈此時即告熄滅。</p>
<p>現在飛機在黑暗高室中，機尾放出來的氣體的閃光，照耀着四周漂蕩的雲層。雲的形式巳起變化，不是疏而軟的；雲的結構如石，立機前升起像一面墻壁，飛機如同飛在一座砂岩上的邊上。機翼上的字母模糊不清，終至看不見什麼。飛機在絕對黑暗中往下側飛。</p>
<p>五時，我們遇到暴風雨。幾個中國人還是睡着。天氣嚴寒，有一美國軍官初次來華乘這飛機，望着我們大家苦笑，因為這是無能為力的。你自然相信飛機不會出什磨毛病。你一在機中就是屬於飛機的一部份，你便得永遠信任它。</p>
<p>DC-2號機在風暴中振盪，所以我們把安全帶再縛縛緊，以免撞向前面的兩位，或跌在地板上。冰雹打在機翼與機身，聲音有如一架打穀機器，電光閃閃，在雲層中隱隱照耀。你把兩手撐住椅子，脚支撐住自己的身體，使坐在椅上穩固一點，推進機與翼上結成薄冰，飛機逐漸高升，已抵雲層之上，如其不能達到一萬六千呎高空的雲層頂端，機師就只好飛回去，飛機上沒有除冰的設備。</p>
<p>一小時後，我們已飛離暴風雨區，不過周圍的雲仍厚如乳酷，機師跑到房艙中來告訴那美軍官，速率計程表在暴風雨中凍滯了。美軍官含笑示意，和他握手，機師說幸虧還無妨；他用窗推開一英吋，看風的速度來測定機行速率，他常常這樣試測的。</p>
<p>渝滇途中</p>
<p>飛機在空中打着盤旋，預備降落，雖然此時還望不見地面，重慶的視度現在是二百五十公呎，為了便於盲目降落起見，中航機機師採用德國式的探測方位無二綫電，這種無綫電周波可以自動調整發信機周率，以與任何長規波無二綫電台周率相適應，於是知道經緯度是在何度。方位探測器的綫圈可以旋在任何方向上，這方向檢視分度羅盤上的度數就可知道</p>
<p>但是全體乘客已在雲堆的隙縫中突然見到一條河流，一列參差不齊的棕色山脈。機師把飛機緩緩打旋，向下降落，周圍的雲已經消失，我們離地極低，可以望見晒在廣塲上的衣服，轟炸後的殘瓦頹垣，數千中國人忽忙地在山徑或街道上行走，重慶看去像是有不少散漫的農村，分佈在一圈山坳中，中央流着石綠的，棕色的長江。我們正飛臨房屋頂上，長江上面，即將在重慶機塲降陸，重慶飛機塲長一千九百呎，闊一百呎，位處江心的一個狹島上，周國羣山環繞，高度都在三千五百呎之上，此島每年有二次浸在水中六十呎，在最佳的季節中則有如密西西比河流中的泥地。、</p>
<p>午後，我們在重慶機塲中飲茶，等待氣候報告，我等即刻動身到昆明，但氣候太好了，人人都討厭明净的天空與日光，在這樣好的氣候下，日機可在越兩根據地飛出，襲擊昆明，我們還得在這晚上飛抵緬甸邊境臘戌，機師羅埃決定把日機轟炸這事不介於懷，想在垂暮時分抵達昆明，日機不會在晚上來投彈的。</p>
<p>田地似乎在山邊上下起伏，田畝的形狀不一，我們在空中看來像片片奇異的花瓣，禾黍被日光照耀，田是紫的，灰的，綠的，黃的。我們飛得很低，見到每樣東西，氣候又是特別的好，我們還可以欣賞風景呢。羅埃說：「我揀認為較有希望的路綫之。」他為適合氣候情形起見，創造一條新的飛行路綫，事實上我們飛臨昆明之前，日機一十七架巳準備飛回去了。</p>
<p>羅埃說：「你得知道，在這條飛行綫上其實是沒有一處可以降陸的。」由飛機下望，只見阡陌縱橫，高的山，狹的河床，在我們後面呢，也是綿互不盡的山脈，你如黑暗中或穿過雲時就不能見到這些，但山河永遠是存在的。</p>
<p>北望山石嶙峋，高矗天外，峯巔積雪猶存，南方更有不盡的山脈，連綿不斷，是一抹美麗的紫色。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談　（七六）</p>
<h3 id="c24">英內閣三健將寫照 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>英國戰時內閣，除邱吉爾首相之外，尙有三員健將：一是這次到美國去接洽軍火的軍需大臣皮孚勃洛克，一是勞工大臣貝文，一是保安大巨莫利遜，茲介紹如下</p>
<p>皮孚勃洛克男爵，蹲坐在辦公桌旁，有一躍而起之勢，經他若干月的督促，他的辦公桌巳為舉世所矚目了。英國大多數閣員，祇在灰褐色的房間中工作，辦公桌是陳舊的壁上的圖畫是褪色的，從窗中望去，祇能看到空白的牆維多利亞時代　掌什的建築，或是幽暗的方塲而巳</p>
<p>惟有這第一任飛機製造大臣現任軍需大臣却不然，他辦公處地位旣高，故能高瞻遠矚，俯視倫敦。當他怪聲吼着，「我們要趕快把飛機升空」之時，那一種莊嚴的姿勢，使他的言辭分外生動有力。他說話的姿勢祇有一種，雙臂舉起，手掌搖動，好似請求上帝斥責那些猶疑怯懦的人一般。</p>
<p>他的右手向窗搖動，左手徘徊於四架電話之問，兩眼却注視着辦公桌中央一個未爆發的定時炸彈。這一位身負重任，建築飛機多多益善的皮孚勃洛克究是怎樣個人物呢？</p>
<p>他這個人，與你們過去所想像的完全不同。他曾獎勵過兩個漫畫家羅氏和司杜柏氏，繪畫一個總是謂齒怪笑的衰老小人，有多年之久。從他自辦的報紙中，可以看出他的性格，似乎粗率而敏捷，新自西半球跑來，不諳英國禮貌，但能努力奮鬥。可是數百萬人依然以「報界怪人」目之，這原是英國人一種輕蔑的口吻。</p>
<p>第一，他並不是一個小丈夫。他身裁雄偉，高達五呎八吋。他難得露齒大笑，致損雅覩，加以性情柔和，人品很是漂亮，所以聲音雖然沙啞，也覺得溫柔動聽。</p>
<p>他雖來自加拿大，實在是蘇格蘭人，不過生長在加拿大而巳。他縱反對此說，但這是事實。他積極活動的生活中，在加拿大的年數不多，大半在英美兩國。他雖榮膺貴族的頭街，但久已懊悔接受，否則今日大可在下議院中說，「我不曾在三十年前，巳告訴過諸君嗎？」原來在一九一〇年時，他巳被舉為國會議員了。</p>
<p>他的老練與年俱增。頑劣的馬克斯（皮孚勃洛克的小名），已一變而為皮孚勃洛克爵士，但他並不是首次參加內閣，遠在一九一八年時，他早巳做過第一任情報部長，這次應邱吉爾首相之召，再度入閣，相隔已有二十年之久了。</p>
<p>他屢次擬擺脫報業主人，迄未如願以償。他擁有三家報紙，格式各各不同。那三種報紙就是「每日快報，」「標準晚報」和星斯快報。」皮孚勃洛克並不使牠們完全遵照他一己的意思辦理。他僅上個主要的投稿者與指導者，而不是獨裁者。</p>
<p>他對於才堪勝任的人，便不情授與全權，以盡其長。這種政策，至今未變。有一次，人家批評說他口裏說出的意見與他報紙論調不同，他便答道，「雖然我閱讀過這些報紙，但這裏邊的文字並非完全我寫的啊！」又有一個時期，故意反對他的主張，倒是最穩妥的辦法，漫畫家羅氏即於此大獲成功。他對於皮孚勃洛克所傾心的每一件事，都加以諷刺，甚至於神聖不可侵犯的帝國自由貿易，也照樣加以攻擊。有許多人至今仍以為這是皮孚勃洛克辦報最偉大的驚人手腕呢</p>
<p>從一九四〇年五月十四日起，他就坐在邱吉爾所指定的辦公桌旁了。靠他的才力識略，或能決定戰爭的勝敗。他坐在桌旁，時而沉思，時而狂吼，在外面走廊和穿堂內的人，都有尊敬的語氣，談着這位大臣的這樣那樣，正如若干年前談到他的父親一般，但是突然之間，這位戰時內閣中一員健將會發出叫聲，把他們的談話打斷，他喊着：「我的朋友，我要告訴你們應做的事，我要你們今天就做，我要你們立刻到那所工廠，我要你們把我的話轉告他們！」</p>
<p>他的秘訣在那裏？他的工作是怎樣？他成功了嗎？若干年前，漫畫家羅氏常把馬克斯畫成一個「强盜男爵，披着外憋，戴着寬邊帽子，上揷羽毛，腰懸短劍。皮孚勃洛克倒很喜歡這種諷刺，便把羅氏僱用了。現在他坐在軍需大臣辦公桌旁，就是强盜男爵的樣子。</p>
<p>英國飛機工業情形，最初很是岌岌可慮。英國的飛機，英國的設計和英國的技士工人，都是世界上最優秀的。但有一個最大缺點就是製造數量不足。因為三十家左右的飛機公司，都各自為政，不相聯絡，全依自己的型式製造。他們好像不知道全世界有崩潰之憂，而一以太平時的「平衡生產」為依歸。</p>
<p>皮孚勃洛克初到弗利脫街「即倫敦的報館街「時，對於「兎子籠式」的房間表示輕蔑，當時的報紙，在十幾間小室中分頭編輯，皮孚勃洛克却把全部編輯人員聚於一室，生客進來，決辨不出誰是總編輯，誰是當差。這果然不大舒服，但在需要速率的地方，却有極大成功。</p>
<p>皮孚勃洛克初任飛機製造大臣後的第一句口號，就是：　「我不要平衡生產！我要廢除平衡！我要飛機的製造迅速！我不要平衡生產！「所以這位强盜男爵就把飛機工業置於統一的基礎之上。緊急國防法旣　以權力，他就大權在握，派遣部屬分赴全國各地，視需要的緩急，把一廠的鋁金屬撥歸另一廠，或是把一廠的飛機間架和零件取來，交與需要更急的另一廠。他所施行於工廠的手段，旋即施行於部屬人員。他的手段，有時推心置腹，有時厲聲呵衆，有時故弄狡獪，雜然並用，令人莫測，即使受到最大打擊的人，亦祇好含笑忍受，除非拂袖而去，否則唯有耐心繼續工作。</p>
<p>據他的屬下說，他所喊的第一個口號是：「我們並不擬革除部中的繁文褥節。我們不需要這樣做。我們祇要跨過這些繁文褥節，而不必加以革除。」他就職時所表示的第一個決心，即拒絕一切個人宣傳。他告訴自己，本人的地位很是微妙，不得不兢兢自守（未完）</p>

<p>本市八老發起之學術講座、昨日上午十時仍假璇宮劇院舉行第九次公開演講、講師為陳選善博士、講題為「四十年來科學方法在敎育上之應用」、首由朱錫璇君代表該講座主席致詞、略謂、學術講座在暑期中徇各中小學敎員之請、延聘專家講述敎育方而各項問題、博得大衆贊譽、今日蒙陳博士惠臨演講、十分感謝、陳博十係現代之著名哲學家及敎育家、早年留美哥倫比亞大學、得哲學博士、回國曾任大夏大學敎育學院院長及各大學敎授、現任公共租界工部局華人敎育處處長、著述豐富、學問淵博云云、是日慕名前往聽眾、十分擁擠、陳氏講解透澈、聽者莫不凝神貫注、陳氏首先解釋科學方法之意義、</p>
<p>如何叫做科學方法</p>
<p>（一）科學方法是尊重事實、對任何問題之處理、必須根據事實、決不能參以絲毫個人之主觀偏見、（二）科學方法是分析的、係將內容複雜範疇廣泛之問題、先分析為若干小問題、然後分別解決、惟此法時或陷於錯誤、蓋往往所分析之各項、不能代表全面也、然此未盡為分析法本身之過、而在乎運用是否合理、（三）科學方法是測騐客觀事實、以求結果、不因個人之利害與成見影響問題的解決、（四）科學方法是應用以往經騐成立一假定並用許多資料、證明此假定之眞確性、（五）科學方法是採用定量方法、整理資料、對每一事物之說明、必加以程度上之限制、總之、科學方法之步驟為觀察事實、成立假定、試騐假定、確定問題、收集資料、而後加以主觀及客觀的考量、並再收集新資料以為說明、最後求出正確的理論、</p>
<p>在敎育上應用歷史</p>
<p>次述科學方法在敎育上應用之歷史略謂、從敎育學說及制度上之多方面觀察、科學方法之在敎育上應用、實肇始於四十年前、約在一九〇〇年左右、即以兒童敎育而言、首先應用科學方法研究兒童敎育者、係美國某敎育家、會於一八八〇年發表兒童發展之研究結果、其後復有人研究心理洲騐、至一九〇九年、敎育測騐之發展、大有成就、一八九八年更有動物實騐敎育方面之統計方法等、進展殊速、一九〇九年、有名敎育家愛爾斯者利用統計法則、研究學生之留級問題、要之、四十年來、自科學方法應用於敎育上後、貢獻殊巨、其間許多成就、咸賴科學方法而產生、且有若干傳統之錯誤觀念、至此亦被推翻、傳統觀念謂成人學習能力不若兒童之强、即被打倒、蓋經研究測騐結果、成人與兒童之學習能力、不相上下、雖然、科學方法、應用於敎育、會陷於僅限於形式訓練之弊、但惟其如此、始得改進、總之、四十年來科學方法、對敎育上之貢獻良多、惟吾人不能以此為滿足、而尙須賡續以求進步、</p>
<p>在敎育上研究方法</p>
<p>又次述及「敎育上科學方法之研究」謂、（一）以歷史的研究方法、參考以往事實改進今後之各種設施、（二）調查事實、以作研究之資料、為最切實際之需要、（三）重視實騐法、在理論上、自甚理想、但實則因敎育之過程、極形複雜、而運用此方法者、復未盡合理、故迄今此法仍未見有何成功、</p>
<p>今後成就尙須努力</p>
<p>來謂、總括言之、四十年來、科學方法已使大多從事敎育事業者、養成客觀態度、對任何問題不致輕下斷語、所言必有所根據、惟對於研究之工具、尙須力求改進、研究範圍應力求擴充、特別關於兒童發展情形、如兒童智慧之發展階段一問題、至今猶各執一詞、並無統一的結論、殊為憾事、又如敎育究竟是否屬於科學至今亦仍無結論、或謂敎育不是科學而是藝術、凡此種種、咸為急需解決而頗有趣味之問題云、</p>

<h3 id="c37">外匯暗市的校報估價 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 章榴</p>
<p>七月二十六日，美國下令凍結中日兩國的資金，英荷兩國也採取平行的辦法。這一個信息傳到了上海之後，各方面執筆奢，大都是望文生義，以爲這是暗市消滅的先機。其惟一理由是根據「凍結」解釋，以爲資金一經凍結，則買方旣無從出賣，買賣旣然消滅，外匯暗市自然也不能存在。是値得一件欣慰的事。</p>
<p>原則事實　截然不符</p>
<p>可是在事實上，外滙暗市的交易，並不因凍給辦法實施而有所變更，同時上海的外滙市塲上，也絲毫看不出有「凍結」的影子。因此，凡是根據凍結原則而寫文章，幾乎是全盤都錯了。依一般說，事實跟猜測的不相符合，這並不是一件怎樣意外的事。但是從凍結資金這一個題目下，理論跟事實的不相符合，實在並不是解釋者理解上的錯誤，而是因為事實上根本沒有「凍結」，既未「凍結」則那裏會影響到事實上的將來演變呢？有人懷疑暗市爲什麼會繼續存在，同時懷疑到暗市有吾其不能消滅的理由，其誤解都是從道裏出發的。</p>
<p>這樣，某某號執照雖然在繼續露布，上海的外滙暗市，除了投機者各依其本人的預測而繼續交易外，並沒有什麼主要的更變。到了八月十八日，平準會方面才正式在香港决定，以對美五元三四三七五的滙率，供給核准的暗市外滙，同時公布申請外滙，須向香港方面依照規定辦法取得核准。這樣，外滙暗市中因爲外滙還有核准與不核准之分別，核准者依掛牌向平準會申請，不核准者就自行向暗市塲中去購買，掛牌價在這一星期來雖還保留原價，而暗市塲中的實際交易價，則仍依供求情形而升降，大體上其匯價比掛牌價更緊縮。如十八日的外滙暗市掛牌價爲五元三一二五，而實際成交價，則爲五元〇三一二五，計相差三十二分之九。</p>
<p>平準措施　綱開一面</p>
<p>浚有方法知道平準會對外匯暗市所採的方式，但照外匯嗜市情形，可以測知平準會的政綱，截止目前止，爲：</p>
<p>（一）把中國外滙政策分成兩部份，一部是後方，一部是上海。後方部份，由財部採取嚴格的統制外滙政策，其滙率爲對美七元半。上海部份，則由平準會負責採取同樣核准制，其滙率爲五元三一二五。</p>
<p>（二）暗市雖然有掛牌，但因美國並未將資金實行凍結之故，仍許其自行買賣，此項買賣的市價，即爲暗市實際成交價。</p>
<p>（三）外滙暗市的成交價，平準會仍採取維持制度，（此項推定係根據暗市中頭寸源源不絕而知）並用買賣方式求其平衡。</p>
<p>因此，在凍結後的上海外滙暗市，可以說是一種比校有規律的統制方法。此項方法，或許是受英美凍結辦法的影響，但却並不是凍結辦法範圍內事。</p>
<p>這樣，外滙暗市在形式上，雖然有若干的變更，但在實質上，其爲中國之漏巵，則仍沒有絲毫轉變，其理由如次：</p>
<p>第一，所謂外滙曙市，其爲資金逃避與資金外流的集中營，這已是無人能吾認的事實。要杜塞此項漏卮。必須採取嚴格的統制外匯政策，至少要限制過去的自由買賣方式；凍結資金這法，原則上是可能消滅暗市的，因爲資金得能實行凍結，則外匯所有人的自由買賣權，與移動權，自然是受相當限制，但現在外匯暗市旣然繼續存在，則外滙的漏巵就也依然存在。</p>
<p>第二，外匯資源的總和，不論其爲後方或暗市流出，也不問在財部帳上或平準會基金帳上付出，其收益爲整個中國的在外資金，其損失爲整個中國對外的負債。外匯暗市流出的資源愈多，則可能維持上海暗市掛脾，與重慶的商業掛脾之外匯準備金愈少。所以暗市上的流出，即等於核准上的浪費相同。換句話說，暗市存在，即爲减低任何統制辦法的效能。</p>
<p>第三，以中國對外貿易情形推測，對外國際收支因爲入超而非出超。任其下去，則外匯基金無論如何充實，必有消竭之一天。要使外匯基金的實力加厚，一方面在竭力壓制外匯的消耗，一方面則在加多外匯的資源。在貿易方面，原則上須求進出口的平衡，在質的一方面，允須對貿易品加以分類，予以分別的待遇，庶幾進口的减少，不致對一般國民生活發生嚴重的影響。依平準會今後的工作與任務言，是沒有聽暗市存在的理由的。</p>
<p>個中關鍵　乃在政治</p>
<p>然而到了現在，外匯暗市還是存在的，有人以爲這是結束以前交易的應有文章，或以爲這是暗市消滅的先聲，這都是錯誤的，惟一的理由，是因爲資金並沒有凍結所造成的現象。</p>
<p>一般人對凍結辦法的本質，過份重視了援華，這是使他們對本問題會更不了解的。美國的凍結辦法，木質上爲其對外的一種策略，主耍目標爲控制日本，而相對的則爲對華有利，其副作用則爲影響匯市。凍結辦法不嚴密，並不是英美銀行不知凍結步驟，乃是說明美日關係尙沒有到嚴重決絕的階段上。如果以爲凍結是爲了法幣或法幣外匯而公布的，這也會使他們更誤解的。</p>
<p>事實上雖是這樣，可是在中國立塲上，旣然巳經要求美國凍結中國部份的資金，爲了加强此項效能計，實有請求施凍結步驟的必要。因爲照現在辦法，對於外匯投機方面，雖不無影響，但在外匯政策上，很少很少有什麼地方改善。至於離開我們預定的目標，自然是更遠了。</p>
<h3 id="c38">匯市的善後問題 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 吳師賢</p>
<p>截至現在，美英凍結中國資金，有什麼效果呢？合乎理想的絲毫米見：出乎意外的倒不少。第一是簪匯市製造了一個黑市的黑市。第二是替緊縮巳極的原有黑匯價，製造了一個再緊縮的機會。</p>
<p>三大滑稽性</p>
<p>雖說美政府已委託上海十四家友邦銀行和中國的四家國家銀行辦理申核供給，非特因無實施細則，故目前尙難奉行；且因不紅過申核的匯票，旣可在滬照常買　，又可在美照常收付；黑市中黑市的產生和存在，反極自然。</p>
<p>雖說申核制度已在積極安排，實現之期或已就在目前。但只做中核供給，而不作截留性的凍結，那來申核供給的實施，徒然使平準會喪失其資金，可能歸平準會獲得的新生出口滙票，反變成黑市中黑市的供給資源。甚至平準會經由申核供給的匯票，也難免不變成黑市中黑市的供給部隊。</p>
<p>雖說美商銀行對於外匯存戶前來提存時，只依黑價給付法幣，而拒付外匯。但在目前，此種辦法徒然增大黑市中黑市之求過於供的程度。而且有趣的，美商銀行處分此種結準的滙票，依然送往匯市中的　市去。而且必待黑市中黑市的匯價比他給進價更縮時才出售。因之更加强了黑市中黑市之匯價緊縮的劣勢。姑不談牠對於中美貿易前途的影響如何，僅就這辦法本身看，似乎有些「只許州官放火，不准百姓點燈」的專權。</p>
<p>至低的善後辦法</p>
<p>放任黑市塲存在，那末匯價的統一和穩定旣辦不到，連防止套購等等政治目標也成白日做夢。凍結與統制以愈嚴密愈妙，現在似乎反在增大窟窿的惡影響，這常然不是原則上錯誤。問題只在辦法的滑稽性太高。因之第一應設法消滅這種滑稽性，第二便應講求强調申核供給的實施辦法。現在外匯平準基金委員會的美英籍委員，都已先後來滬了；而且外　平準基金委員會從上週一起，　恢復其原有的活動了。我們有許多理由相信目前的滑稽</p>

<p>— 張一凡先生　陳君　筆記</p>
<p>——滬江大學商學院商業新聞」教材——</p>
<p>公債利益之算式：</p>
<p>購藏公債，在個人爲投資，對國家爲報效。惟旣發公債之賣買，僅係公債債權人間債權之轉移，無助國家財政之收益。故欲取得個人投資與爲國報效二層意義，則唯有購藏國家新發之公債。</p>
<p>我國自有債券公債後，公債市塲即隨之產生。在北伐之翁，各債價格常在票面四成之：北伐之後，經國府竭誠整理？債信日上，市價亦隨之上昇；市價上昇，則發行新債時之折扣得以提高，國庫損失乃得减免，在八一三戰事發生前，財部鑒於各公債投機在熱，佔價飛漲不得不實行最低限價政策。規定甲種至低七六·〇元，乙種至低七三·五元，丙種至低七一·五元，丁戊兩種至低均不得小於七〇·〇元，蓋其時各債市價較此限價猶高出三四元至十餘元不等。戰事旣開，交易所奉令停業；旋有黑市發生。其初各債暗盤幾較戰前跌去一倍模樣，其後逐漸回好；至於今日，巳恢復戰前現象。</p>
<p>公債不僅爲人民投資之可靠標的，且爲金融機關運用資金時最良好方法。因債息旣遠校存息爲高，且極可靠；如現款需急時可隨時出讓，在周旋資金上極爲方便。故各銀行之支付準備中公債常作其重要部份者蓋此。</p>
<p>統一各債現定每年一七兩月各付息還木一次，還本用抽籤方法；中籤奢即如數收本。由於本市各界投資於公債者至夥，每决還本付息，常使本市通貨界一時增大其流通額。此於投機狂熱之今日，自非安全，故現巳改每决還本付息，均分六期給付；如在財部所在地牧款，則可一决給付。每當還本付息前一個月內，各債市價輒較平時高漲；還本付息期一過，即一入二月及八月之第一日，市價即减去其應得之息金（即三元），此之謂除息，不能視債價之變動者也。辦法，已在淸算之中。</p>
<p>其實要消弭現行凍結辦法上的滑稽性，只有一條路可走，那就是電請美英財部立刻宣佈「非經申核供給之一切對美對英的進出口匯票，不論其用途如何？發票銀行爲誰？一槪不能在美兌現，或在中美英三國領土內轉移其債權。凡有私相轉移債權之事，非特仍不能在美在英兌現，而且吾認其法律上的效力」。同時宣佈「今後一切申核供給之對美對英匯蔡，除原有簽章外，復應加蓋中美英外滙平準基金委員會印童；如無外滙平準會印章，即作未經核准論」。此種辦法如獲實現，那末在黑市中的黑市上所交易的滙票，都變成了廢紙。黑市中的黑市，也就消減於無形了。而中國的出口匯票，即使在控制力不及的淪陷區裏，也不怕他不結售到平準會控制的市塲上去。因之平準會也可不致再蹈祇供無入的覆轍。而申核供給制度的强化與生效，也就不成問題了。</p>
<h3 id="c40">中國的農貸（續）　最近動態及其光明前途 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 陳禾章</p>
<p>在二十九年年底止的二〇九，五〇二，一六七元農貸中，中國農民銀行放出九六，七四一，〇〇〇元，佔百分之四六·一八；中國銀行敖出五一，三五〇，〇〇〇元，佔百分之二四·五一；農本局（二十九年十月改組之前）放出三七，八五五，三八二元，佔一八·〇七；交通銀行放出一二，五七九，七八五元，佔百分之六：中央信託局放出一〇，九七六，〇〇〇元，佔百分之·二四。</p>
<p>本年度（三十年）農貸總數，據四聯總處表示，希望達到四〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。經訂的的鉅額農貸，已有數筆，如四川省一三六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，陝西省三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>關於三十年度貸款的放出，各行的分配如下：中國農民銀行負責百分之四十五；中國銀行百分之二十五；交通銀行與中央信託局各百分之十五。</p>
<p>此種農貸的分類，可別爲農業生產貸款，農業供銷貸款，農產儲押貸款，農田水利貸款，農村運輸工具貸款，佃農購置料地貸款，農村副業貸款及農產推廣貸款等。四聯總處復依照如下的方針，辦理農貸：（一）促進大後方的農產增加，土地墾殖與疏通水利，舉辦手工業與小工叢；（二）直接輔助農民團體，並推進合作事業，樹立物市合作金康；（三）貸款分配力求平衡，其手續力求簡捷，適應農時。</p>
<p>農貨物前途</p>
<p>自戰事發生以後，中國政府積極鼓勵農貸的努力，可從上述農貸數字的增加證明，今後農貸的進行，當本政府旣定方針及改進之途徑邁進，母待贅述。然尙有一點陳述者：中國自創辦新式農業金融機關以來，多從事於短期　款，其經營中期放款的並不多見，對長期放款則多避重就輕，望然引去。考之各專家意見，均認中國農業發展的途徑，應以政府扶助佃農獲得耕地，扶助小農擴張耕地爲要圖，是以舉辦長期土地放款，有絕對的需要。</p>
<p>本年初中國農民銀行成立土地金融處，資金暫定一千萬元。據該處負責人謂，其業務方針以總理對於土地政策的指示爲方釘。其貸款種類，計分六類。（一）土地照價收買放款；（二）土地微用放款；（三）土地改良放款；（四）土地重劃放款；（五）扶助自耕農放款；（六）地籍整理放款。從放款的種類，可知政府已在舉辦畏期土地放款，但該處資金目前僅爲一千萬元，要舉辦上述各種放款，當需要大量資金，一千萬元的數額自不能應付裕如。况長期土地放款，資金較爲呆滯，利息更較低微，所以需要長期的低利資金，以供周轉。關於此，土地金融處自可以土地担保，而發行債券，以獲取資金。</p>
<p>考中國農貸資金的來源，大部分來自全囤性的金融機關，佔全部百分之七四·六五，各省地方銀行及農民銀行合佔百分之一一·五九。至商業銀行以業務性質關係，固不宜於舉辦農貸；可是兼辦儲蓄業務的商業銀行，應根據儲蓄銀行法之規定，必須以其儲蓄存款總額五分之一，投資於農村。看來各銀行之儲蓄存款，恐尙未能完全依照該法規定辦理。查截至二十八年底止，中國的商業儲蓄銀行有七十家，合其他銀行兼理儲蓄者，兩共已近百萬，所吸牧的儲蓄存款，　額當茶鉅。故政府對此辦理儲蓄業務商業銀行及兼營儲蓄業務的銀行，應嚴厲督促，務使其將應對農村合作社之質押放款及以農產品爲質之放款，購買土地金融處或國家農業金融機關所發行的債券，其數額不得少於存款總數五分之一。這不但可使農貸資令獲得可靠而豐富的泉源；並且可减少一般不良銀行的經營投機事業。</p>
<p>如上述的一點，能付諸實現，則中國農貸前途實有無窮的希望，而農業的發展，亦未可限量！</p>
<p>（注）此數字並非全年的總數，上年（二十八年）底前收回的貸款數額未統計在內，本年（二十九年）巳定而尙未付出的農貸亦未包括在內。</p>

<h3 id="c49">霍爾巴樞抵滬後　昨召開金融會議　對管理滬匯作重要決定　詳細實施辦法即可公表 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>中國外滙平準基金委員會美籍委員　現任英國遠東財政參贊霍爾巴樞氏（E．L．Hall　Pateh）、於前晚八時乘怡和洋行裕生輪自港抵滬、因該輪臨時決定在淞口拋　過夜、於昨晨方駛入浦江、十時餘、般靠羅斯福碼頭、移時、霍氏偕其女秘書自艙內出、緩步下輪、由迎接者陪同赴外灘二十七號英國大使館休息、隨即彙同　幫辦泰萊及中外銀行要員在大使館內會談有關上海滙市問題、歷三小時始畢、但此　係初步檢討、日內當有更縝密之研究與考慮、以決定結滙方案也、</p>
<p>前夜到滬　昨晨登岸</p>
<p>霍爾巴樞氏自港來滬之消息、最初由四行方面於前晨向記者透露、其所乘之裕生輪亦原定前晚八時　滬、後因在淞口拋錨過夜、延至昨晨十時許、方駛抵羅斯福碼頭、平準會駐滬美幫辦泰萊博士、有關各中外銀行負責人員、以及英國大使館高級職員、均聯袂赴輪埠迎迓、霍氏之艙位爲大菜間五號、隨從有女秘書一人、十時十五分、霍氏含笑下輪、與迎迓者一一握手、略表寒喧後、即乘英使館汽車、赴外灘二十七號英國大使館休息、有關銀行之負責人員及泰萊博士等、均陪同前往、</p>
<p>維護上海　正當貿易</p>
<p>霍爾巴樞氏久任英遠東財政參贊、對於中國經濟情形、極爲熟悉、自繼羅傑士而爲平準委會英委後、對於外滙政策之決定、貢獻甚多、此次由平準基金委員會八月十六日　渝首决會議、決定奉派來滬監督、一方向固爲加强平準委會與上海滙市之聯絡、另一方面則協同泰萊博士研討一最適用於上海特殊情形之結滙方法、以維護正當之進出口貿易、完成平準基金運用之目的、此外霍氏對於上海及叫圍淪陷區之貨幣情形、將從事專門之調查、俾擬定一鞏固中國法幣基礎之計劃、供平準會參考、</p>
<p>召集會議　商討辦法</p>
<p>但霍氏此决所以怱忽於八日內趕至上海、乃係應駐滬美幫辦泰萊博士之敦促、蓋泰氏與滬各關係銀行商定之結滙基本原則、有待霍氏之參加意見、並作進一步之籌擬也、霍氏於昨日上午十時半、抵英國使署稍作休息後、即邀集泰萊博士與滙豐·花旗·麥加利·中央·中國·交通·及農民等各行負責人士商談滬市必需品結滙具體方案，除先由各行報告目前由塲情形外、即集中根據已定之原則、討論必需品之結滙及奢侈品之　止結滙問題、會議歷時達三小時之久、至下午一時半始行散會、</p>
<p>討論內容　透露一般</p>
<p>昨日會議內容、雖嚴守秘書、但據接近銀行界方面透露、會議重　議程、計有五項、一、如何依照重要性將應供給外滙之必需品分成數類、除重要部份完全供給外、决要及冉决要部份、應行結滙之數、應佔申請額百分之幾、二、如何評定非禁止進口物品而具奢侈性質之物品、在何種情形、得供給一部、在何種情形下、得有權全部拒絕供給、三、在審核方面、如何確定貿易爲善意、如何調查其申請結滙數額是吾等於正當之需要、四、在申請手續方面、何種保證最爲確實可靠、何種標準最爲適用、五、如何加强中交兩行對於滬出口商結滙之統制、</p>
<p>詳細辦法　即將公佈</p>
<p>上列議程、在昨日會議中均已有所討論、大致上已獲得統一之意見、至於詳細實施辦法、已交由四行聯合辦事處根據一九三九年七月海關公佈之禁止進口貨品名單及一九四〇年九月行政院通過之准予進口貨品名單曁歷决泰萊與銀行界會議之決議、趕速擬訂、此一辦法、將可於短期內正式公佈、因外間銀行雖已供給一部份正常需要之外滙、但尚無確定辦法可以遵循、故辦法之公佈、實有愈速愈佳之必要、此一辦法公佈後、經美一般照會規定之中外銀行、均將一體照辦、</p>
<p>外商銀行　通力合作</p>
<p>又據現行界透露消息泰萊博士召集滬各指定中外銀行負責人昌，商議結滙辦法時、曾有激烈之辯論、　英商銀行方面、認爲對已行結售之非重要必需品外匯、得向平準基金委會補進、相反之意見、則謂此舉對於平準基金之消耗、影饗甚人、不能照結售額全數補進、最後經相互之眞誠諒解、決定今後在供給申請外匯之前、必須先得平準基金委員會之同意、吾則爲防止基金無限制消耗起見、不能補進、外商銀行對於此層表示接受與合作、故以後外匯管理制度、將益趨嚴密也、</p>

<p>昨據航業界消息、美國總統輪船公　在本月底將有總統輪一艘、由美抵滬、載運本埠撤退美僑、經舊金山返美、下月中、將另有總統輪二艘來滬、其中一艘、即爲本月十五日離滬、經好望角返美之世界班輪船哈立遜總統號、至荷蘭渣華輪船公司之芝沙丹尼號、頭二等艙位多已訂出、聞大部爲英美國　人士所訂購、蓋渠等如搭乘該輪至荷印轉澳洲返國、則較爲便利也、木埠荷　因遠東時局尚未至最嚴重時期、故擬撤退返國者、爲數甚少、</p>
<p>菲島日　　續撤一批</p>
<p>據悉、續有日本僑民一行一百六十名、於本月二十三日、乘法國郵船公司之開庭號、由馬尼拉撤退來滬、廿三日由馬尼拉乘法國郵船霞飛將軍號抵滬之日本婦孺等三百七十一名、其中二百名、已決定乘今日上午十時離滬開往神戶之淺間丸返國</p>

<p>— 諸君述葛亮撰</p>
<p>據在社會上有很深騐的人說：「一個人至少有兩副不同的面具，才能在社會——現在特殊情形的社會——上立足。」</p>
<p>可是，怎樣才可以有兩副不同的面具呢？玩具店中雖有着許多不同的假面具，然而怎麼能戴着去見人呢？想了兩天，靈機一動，我便預備了兩套衣服：一套派立司西裝和一件藍布長杉。</p>
<p>一則是畢了業沒有事做，終日在家中賦閒，簡直悶得發慌；再則我想在未踏進社會之前，先試探試探社會，免得將來吃虧。</p>
<p>起先，我把兩件衣服輪流的穿了，在衣櫥的鏡前照着。第一决，沒有發現；二决猶不够；於是連看了三决。啊！我覺得西裝中是個人，可是將我放在中裝之中，我何嘗不是一個人呢！換句話說，穿了西裝，我是我；但是穿了中裝，我也還是我自己，有什麼兩樣？</p>
<p>噢，有人說我穿了西裝像個靑年。哈！難道我穿了藍布長杉會變成鬚髮皆白的老公公嗎？啊，天地良心！</p>
<p>還有一件事似乎我不應該提起的，免得傷了一個朋友的友誼。不過那人是很豁達的，大概也會「君子不記小人之過的。」</p>
<p>一天，那服友說：「你走起路來姿勢很優美，活潑天眞、有些像好萊塢的泰降鮑華。」在明亮的眸子中，我看到了這並不是諷刺。</p>
<p>泰降鮑華，對他雖然不很熟悉，但在銀幕上也和他會面過一二次；至於像他，連夢想也沒有想到過。我記得戰國策上。說鄒忌不反城北徐公美，不過忌尚形貌映麗呢，我自己，窺鏡自視後，啊，又醜父可笑，那評語我受了，使我慚愧得汗流了一身，恨不得人地有鬥。</p>
<p>可是，有一天，那朋友又說：「你常常在走路時故意擺架子，眞所謂矯揉造作。」</p>
<p>奇哉怪也！起先譽我，後來非我，其中不知有什麼奧妙，研究了四天，我始終覺得自己的走路，無論在什麼時候都是一式一樣的，也許是我這位偵探還有些小聰明，竟然在第五天水落石出了。原來是前者會面時穿西裝，後者穿的是藍布長衫。</p>
<p>但是另一個問題又在腦中盤旋了，穿了西裝，動作優美；穿了長杉，怎麼會使人起惡感呢？</p>
<p>爲了那問題整整的失眠了兩夜。不，可以說三夜，因爲在第三夜的十一點五十七分的時候，我得到了答案，那答案使我從床上跳起來，興奮了一個晚上。</p>
<p>原因是很簡單的，你想，泰降鮑華他可曾穿過藍布長衫嗎？是了，那就是答案。</p>
<p>穿了藍布長衫，在某某公司中東張西望，竟會惹起一位稽查先生的注意，煩他勞動大駕，緊緊地「保護」我，當我在某某部前立定時，他便立在近旁，　炬般的眼光炯炯地瞪着我。我越是不買東西，越是使他疑心，承蒙他的盛意，一直將我送到門口。</p>
<p>不甘心，一星期後換了洋裝去，雖然那稽查沒有遇到，而女職員的晚娘臉孔，却和善得多了。也許是東張西望的態度，使伊注意。伊對我發問了。起初我以爲伊的問題或許和那個稽查的眼光是同一效用的；啊！我錯了。</p>
<p>「需要買些什麼東西嗎？」伊問。</p>
<p>我默默地回到家中，拿起一架放大鏡，在藍布長衫中搜尋了，上面竟然會沒有賊」字的。或許我的放大鏡不及那稽查的眼球吧？是的，世界上有許多人的瞳孔可以遠勝顯微鏡，因爲他們可以在衣服上明晰地觀察貧富，假使你用顯微鏡，哼，休想休想！</p>

<p>西瓜香瓜的時代已過去了，黃瓜早就老了。瓜類之中，惟有絲瓜冬瓜還在活躍於小菜塲上，絲瓜旣一些兒不覺得老，價格也還小貴，一角輔幣可買兩三條，買道麼二四角錢，加些輔佐品在內，也可敷衍日夜兩頓了。上回我曾說過，絲瓜只可做素菜，葷菜中是沒有它的位置的。可是承編者轉來讀者杜履冰先生一封信，說絲瓜可以炒蛋，並做蛋湯，做法很簡便，只須將絲瓜去皮，切成小塊，與蛋調和後，入鍋同炒，做湯時除絲瓜蛋花外，可加蝦米邊尖或干貝，其味也很鮮美。筆者對於這兩種做法，已分別試過，的確不錯，讀者們也何妨一試。</p>

<p>熱水瓶顧名思義是用來盛貯熱水的，使用的方法，大家都知道將熱水注入瓶內，再把軟木塞塞上，更沒有別的奧妙了。可是對於怎樣使它的壽命保長？怎使它的功効耐久？及怎樣使用才合乎衛生？這幾點，就許多人忽略了；往往有因使用的不合法，不但多耗金錢，而且找來無謂煩惱，眞是懊喪萬分。現在我把使用熱水瓶最普遍易犯應改善各點，寫在下面，希望產婦們加以注意，也可算是一種家庭間常識。</p>
<p>、盛注沸水之先，須用溫水渥過，免致瓶膽驟受熱力訇然爆裂。</p>
<p>二、冲水完畢，須將瓶殼各部水漬拭乾，否則滴留底部，漸漸腐爛，久之就有脫底之虞，幷且危及瓶膽。</p>
<p>三、冲水之前，須將瓶中存水傾出，及加以洗滌，以免水中雜質（俗謂水脚），棲附瓶中，日深月久，必至玻璃　起沙，此後倒出之水亦必帶有汚質，不慎飲下，至碍健康。</p>

<h3 id="c82">店員學徒如何進修？ <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>一般店員學徒不乏學養有素之士，但有的也有學識不敷應用的痛苦；他們會懷疑生產機械上的某種　成，商品的社會關係，甚或會計科目上的所以然……他們的基本業務因爲熟練之故，並非不能勝任；然而或許一接觸到工作的深度之時，效率因有若干限制，終不能十分愉快講求。店員學徒有些在就業之初，不過受到極有限度的學校敎育，雖然在服務經騐上竟至超過一班特殊的半瓶醬油一罐醋剛出校的畢業生。</p>
<p>現代社會的業務旣然如此複雜，一切趨於合理化科學化，一般企業家更爲其事業奮發圖强，力求出路，則大都從業員安能不適合潮流，善爲應付種種工作上的新變化？學問之道，端求進步。湯之盤銘曰：「苟日新，又日新，日日新，一做個時代的不落伍奢自不容易。</p>
<p>每見有一種人，抱着做一日和尚撞一日鐘的見解，無論爲方丈，主持，知客，香火，務求其因循敷衍，本份的工作馬馬虎虎做掉拉倒，遑言其怎樣唸經，鐘撞得新式不新式，老調不老調。服務旣嫌呆板而單調，則其生活自然有「度日如年」之感，此種心理日積月累，就養成「吃一行怨一行」的習慣，但是不聽見人家說嗎？一行行出狀元。」我的工作在使出品如何精良，運銷如何增多，待人接物如何改善，會計制度如何嚴密，這些都得講求，日日求其進步，才可出人頭地，獲得最後勝利。</p>
<p>現代開明的企業家從業員眼光並非不遠，（頗多機關出資使練習生深造，以求業務之適應，即其一例）他們埋頭苦幹，頗有作爲，業餘之時，不忘於學業之進修；冀望爲國家爲私人事業，打出一條光明之路來！</p>
<p>一個團體組織，養成了「好學」的風氣，對於整個業務上固有極大的幫助，就在個人的私生活上亦未嘗不可養成更良好的習慣。每見少數從業員，工作之後，無聊賴，好的呢，唱唱歌，吹吹琴，更甚者却是不斷的舞榭妓寮，大吃豆腐，生活因之則失其常度，預算因之而失其平衡。此中之故，在於有閒，救之之道，厥爲進修。古人說善養吾浩然之氣，所謂氣者確在修養中得來。由此可不動搖，不餒怯，可從善，可銳進。客觀的環境，實賴於主觀的改造，我在這裏正不敢作唯心的說敎。</p>

<h3 id="c83">用娘的姨難 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 煜兒</p>
<p>李家的娘姨回到鄕下去了，所以李師母只得扭着小脚親自到薦頭店裏去喊了一個娘姨——是一個身體高大的山東人，她力大如牛，各種繁重的事都做；李師母當然很合意，可是有一件事使她非常遺憾，那就是她每頓要吃三大碗飯，因此李師母打定主意情願多出幾塊錢工錢叫她少吃飯，她就和她商量了：</p>
<p>「噯，娘姨，儂事體做得蠻好格，不過飯吃得太多，所以我給你五元工錢之外再給你三元米貼，那就是說每頓你要少吃二大碗飯。」</p>
<p>「格啊啦勿做，出來做娘姨就是爲了吃飽飯呀。」說着提了包裹就走。李師母呆望着她的背影在門外消失。</p>
<p>從此李師母得到了一個教訓，就是身體粗大的娘姨飯量太大；因此她第二天到薦頭店裏去喚了一個身體瘦小的娘姨，她覺得很滿意，至少飯吃得少，不料，這個娘姨來了一個「自動辭職」，說是人太多，事體繁忙吃不消」。</p>
<p>李家人多，天氣父是熱，李師母那裏做得下這許多家事呢，所以她覺得很煩惱，晚飯後李師母搬了一只凳到弄堂裏去乘風凉，和鄰居談起用娘姨的事，隔壁的娘姨很「熱心」願替她介紹一個人，而且保證能够使她滿意。</p>
<p>次日早上，隔壁的娘姨果真領來了一個年輕力強的人，李師母把她留下，她注意她的做事，真的，被她發現百分之一百的滿意；她非但做事迅速，而且飯量很小，李師母在滿意之下不禁在心中打起「哈哈」來。第三天是「稱工錢」的日子，這是老規矩，李師母預備和她談談「工資問題」，但是，出她意料之外，這個娘姨先開口說：</p>
<p>「阿常有又麻將，請客阿是常有格，……工錢要十二元，外快祇少要有五元，格末做格。」</p>
<p>「外快碰「額角頭」格，工錢只有……」這個娘姨不等她說完，拍拍屁股就走。</p>
<p>李師母目瞪口呆了好久。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Envoy Nomura Visits Hull: Frank Discussion of Far Eastern Difficulties, Elaborating on the Positions of Various Countries but Reaching No Conclusion; Nomura Says U.S.-Japan Differences May Be Resolved <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th. Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Nomura, met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday and afterwards told reporters that he believed the differences between the U.S. and Japan could be remedied. Nomura said, "If this is not the case, its foolishness is beyond description." He declined to disclose the contents of the meeting but hoped that the navigation difficulties could be resolved. He declined to answer questions about whether he planned to raise the issue of the United States handling the transportation of war materials to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. Nomura told reporters, "Our conversation was not like that of diplomats, but like that of ordinary people. Mr. Hull outlined your government's position, which we already knew. I outlined my government's position, but no conclusion was reached." When referring to remedying the differences between the U.S. and Japan, Nomura said, "I firmly believe that this can be done, but I don't know how to do it yet."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 24th. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura, after meeting with Secretary of State Hull, hosted reporters and said that the differences between the U.S. and Japan's Far Eastern policies must be communicated, although he currently does not know how to communicate them, he firmly believes that they can be communicated. During his talks with Hull, he had a frank discussion of general difficulties related to the Pacific, but no agreement was reached. They did not consider each other as diplomats, but as people who wanted to seek a mutually satisfactory solution to the main differences.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th. The Hochi Shimbun this morning carried remarks by political commentator Shimizu criticizing Prime Minister Konoe, saying that Japan currently needs a firm and unwavering policy, but Konoe is overly influenced by conflicting forces. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association has failed to unify public opinion, now admits its weakness and requests public assistance. Other organizations initiated by Konoe have also failed to achieve anything, because Konoe listens to everyone and does nothing. If the country does not have a more resolute figure, it will be defeated by the enemy.</p>
<p>The Far East Crisis is Not Resolved, It is Difficult for Europe to Obtain Peace</p>
<p>Havas, Chongqing, 23rd. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun published a statement that China sent Cheng Qian to Moscow to participate in the British, American, and Soviet conference. The government spokesperson here refuted it, pointing out that it was completely fabricated. Also, the Japanese side broadcast the news of Yang Jie going to the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources also said that there was absolutely nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Havas, Chongqing, 23rd. Today's Central Daily News editorial, titled "The Moscow Conference and the Far East," said that under the current situation, long-term war preparation is extremely important, and how to enable the Soviet Union to intensify its resistance against Nazi attacks is particularly urgent. In order to enable the Soviet Union to fully confront the European Nazis, it must first be relieved of its worries in the East. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Moscow Conference will conduct a close review of the Far Eastern situation. Japan's strategy is eight big characters: "Burying head in preparation, waiting for the opportunity to move." All actions of the aggressor are swift actions at their most advantageous time. The invaded are in an extremely unfavorable position. If we do not change from passive to active in the future, the future will still be difficult to be optimistic. Roosevelt's, Churchill's declarations and the Moscow Conference are active, but still formally active, and still insufficient, and must be substantial and lively. The Moscow Conference discussed the utilization of united resources, and should recognize the entire situation to serve as the standard for distribution. On the eve of the meeting, we specially remind the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to pay attention that the Far East is more important than Europe, and that without first resolving the Far Eastern crisis, Europe will not obtain peace.</p>
<p>Havas, Manila, 23rd. Japanese residents here withdrew a batch last Monday, totaling about 400 people. Today, another batch of 150 people withdrew to their country.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Puget Sound Area: U.S. Military Exercises <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Sand Point, 24th. A large number of defensive forces have gone to the front line yesterday and will launch a massive counter-attack this morning to begin military exercises in the Puget Sound area. It is expected that the offensive of the defense forces will be carried out in the vicinity of Shelton to repel the aggressors of the "Gray Age." The "Red" Navy (the invading army has eight cruisers, twelve destroyers, and multiple aircraft carriers) is stationed at the entrance of the Puget Sound, and Seattle and Bremerton are also feeling the threat of "invasion." According to the defensive headquarters here, troop transports are leading the Red Navy and can land in Anacortes Harbor on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, because the defenders do not have a navy.</p>
<p>Burma Continues to Levy Transit Taxes on Goods Transported to China; U.S. Public Opinion Expresses Dissatisfaction; British Government Orders a 1% Reduction</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th. U.S. news agencies have instructed their London correspondents to inquire about information regarding Burma levying transit taxes on goods transported to China under the Lend-Lease Act. This move indicates that U.S. public opinion is dissatisfied with the continued collection of such transit taxes, because it is incompatible with the common purpose of assisting China. Since the United States has sacrificed everything under the Lend-Lease Act, Burma should also make some sacrifices.</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 24th. Authoritative sources here stated yesterday that the British government has sent an urgent official document to the Burmese government, stating that the tariff of 1% of the value should be reduced for all Lend-Lease goods transported to China via Burma. It is believed here that Burma is an autonomous political entity, especially with regard to all internal affairs, such as tariffs, and has complete autonomy, but authoritative sources said that the British government believes that all Lend-Lease goods should be exempt from taxes. The Burmese tax authorities' defense stated that the tax rate had already been reduced since the reopening of the Burma Road last October, and that the Burmese government had paid special expenses for the construction of the Burma Road. It also said that goods transported to China are often piled up in Lashio, which often requires the Burmese government to provide special police and unloading places. The Burmese government has also paid huge expenses for repairing this road.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th. The Ministry of Commerce has just issued an order prohibiting the export of any goods to China, Japanese-controlled Pacific islands, and Australia from Monday, except for those with licenses. However, this prohibition does not apply to those entering mainland China via the Burma Road from Rangoon. If those entering China from Rangoon are goods that require a license to be exported to any location outside the British Empire, they will also require a license in the future. It is heard that the purpose of this order is to intensify the suppression of exports to Japan and cut off the route of trade between the occupied areas of China and Japan. Therefore, this order is like the freezing of Chinese funds, and is not an action detrimental to China, but actually helps China. Its impact can keep the Burma Road open without any restrictions.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th. The U.S. Red Cross Headquarters here stated yesterday that its work in China is increasing day by day. Another report said that rice and wheat are transported to Hong Kong and Shanghai by American ships, and large quantities of medicines are transported to Rangoon via the Burma Road, so that they can go directly to the free Chinese area. The report also stated that the Red Cross's war relief expenses, to date, total US$47,087,052, of which the United Kingdom received US$25,340,330, and China received about US$3,000,000.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Groups Donate to Help Britain</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 24th. The first week of September will be "Aid Britain Week." At that time, overseas Chinese in Malaya will donate to help Britain to express their gratitude for being able to live in Malaya without disturbance, without being poisoned by the Japanese, and for Britain's aid to China. This move was decided at a meeting of overseas Chinese representatives in Southeast Asia. A representative said that the only way to avoid future suffering is to shorten the war period, and the best way to reduce the war period is to promote Britain's victory. Another representative told others that what the Chinese Foreign Minister said, that the victory of democratic countries will first be seen in the Far East, seems to be realized. Japan is now preparing to show its high-pressure tactics on both the sea and land, which just completes the encirclement it has called upon itself. The front line of democratic countries from north to south is about to be completed, and ABCD will do their best to defeat Japan and the Axis powers.</p>
<p>London, 23rd. Representatives of various overseas Chinese groups here held a League Conference to raise funds for the Chinese Disaster Relief Fund today, and decided to set the first week of September as Aid Britain Week to raise funds to relieve British refugees.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Burma Can Cope with Any Eventuality at Any Time; French in Saigon Oppose Vichy's Concessions <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, 24th. Burma is a very important place in the entire strategy of the Far East. If the war extends to that place, Britain's finest war equipment and troops can be used. This is known from the endless stream of young British sea and air warriors entering and leaving Rangoon. Although these strong men look young, they are indeed veterans. Many of them wear hard-won medals. Since Japan occupied the airfields of Vietnam, Burma has built an airfield line connecting to Malaya, so it can cope with the actions of other parties at any time.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th. The Free French Command bulletin stated that the French in Saigon publicly expressed their opposition to Vichy's concessions to Japan. A French officer who escaped from Saigon after the Japanese army arrived in Vietnam said that the French in Saigon were extremely indignant about the pro-Japanese attitude of Governor-General Decoux and repeatedly took public actions to express their dissatisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="e4">US Orders Seizure of Federal Shipyard to Avoid Hindrance to Shipbuilding Program <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Hyde Park on the 24th, President Roosevelt signed an executive order yesterday to seize the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Kearny, New Jersey. The plant has been on strike for sixteen days. The President ordered the Navy Department to take possession of the plant immediately, as the facility has $493,000,000 in national defense shipbuilding contracts. The shipyard will resume operations on Monday morning, including the construction of six destroyers, three oil tankers, and two cargo ships.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Hyde Park on the 24th, White House sources indicate that a decision on whether the government will purchase, lease, or seek a manager for the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company will be made after further study.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>US-Japan Negotiations</p>
<p>In the past month, US-Japan relations have experienced at least three periods of tension: the US and Britain announced the freezing of Japanese assets on July 26th, Japanese planes bombed the American gunboat Tutuila in Chongqing on the 30th, and recently, Japanese officials prevented American citizens from returning home on the Coolidge. All of these events caused significant fluctuations. Furthermore, matters such as US and British concerns over Thailand, the US ban on exporting aviation fuel to Japan, the issuance of the Atlantic Charter, and the US sending oil tankers to Vladivostok to aid the Soviet Union have all been met with repeated opposition from Japanese officials. US-Japan relations have been steadily deteriorating recently. However, the aforementioned periods of tension have not led to the outbreak of a larger conflict. On the contrary, most of them have been defused, quickly returning to calm after a period of clamor. And between Grew and Toyoda, Nomura and Hull, negotiations continue to proceed through diplomatic channels. According to common sense, there is usually a period of considerable calm before a storm. However, the current situation between the US and Japan cannot be explained by this view alone.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be clarified is the fundamental position of the US Far East policy. Since the unveiling of the Stimson Doctrine of Non-Recognition to the present day, there have been countless changes and a long period of evolution. The recent activism displayed is probably something that the isolationists would never have dreamed of four years ago when their voices were at their loudest. However, the spirit of anti-aggression has remained consistent throughout, as has the sympathy for China and the vigilance and criticism toward Japan. When Wuhan and Guangzhou fell one after another, at a time when China's war effort was at its most disadvantageous, the US, in conjunction with Britain and France, issued stern notes warning Japan. Therefore, now that Japan's strength has been exhausted and the forces of the anti-aggression front in the Far East are flourishing, it would be unreasonable to say that the US would excessively accommodate the aggressor, or even that it would only be capable of employing a policy of appeasement. What the world still feels disappointed about regarding the US Far East policy is only that its steps are not active enough and its sanctions lack rigor, to the extent that it has not yet fully taken the initiative. The existence of these loopholes, it is believed, is not a momentary oversight on the part of the US authorities, but rather a deliberate arrangement to leave the aggressor some room for reflection and repentance amidst the increasing severity. After the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, there must have been thorough discussions and response decisions regarding the crisis-ridden Far East, and the Far East issue must have been one of the most important tasks of this meeting. In the event of a change in the future, it will be able to command and control effectively. However, at present, the US authorities are clearly not prepared to go any further than the current steps. On the one hand, this is based on the US's consistent stance of valuing the European situation over the Far East. At a time when the ferocity of the Nazis is still rampant, it is even more important to intensify support for Britain and the Soviet Union as the primary task. On the other hand, it is due to the belief that, under the current situation where interests are so clearly intertwined, allowing Japan to choose for itself will surely make Japan restrain itself and stop. At the same time, this is also the reason why the US has not refused to continue negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>As for Japan, for the past few years, it has consistently taken the easing of relations with the US as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. Its emphasis on this is sometimes even greater than its alignment with the Axis powers. In the later period of the Second Konoe Cabinet, in particular, diplomacy with the US was regarded as the central task. After the establishment of the new Konoe Cabinet, although its actions have angered the US in many ways, its policies have sought to appease the US in many ways. For example, the deliberate display of leniency regarding retaliatory measures for the freezing of funds, the quick apology and compensation to the US for the Tutuila incident, the vigorous explanation regarding the evacuation of nationals dispute, asserting that they were not being detained as hostages, and the public declaration that it did not want any sensational evacuation of nationals to avoid arousing the emotions of the American people, all demonstrate an attempt at compromise. The Japanese Ambassador Nomura in the US has spared no effort in this regard. In addition, although Japan is eager to advance southward, given the failure and inability to end the war of aggression against China, it must cautiously avoid the outbreak of another war unless the timing is very favorable. Japanese Finance Minister Ogura once publicly stated that Japan is not yet in a position to be prepared for any eventuality and to provoke Britain and the US. Therefore, as long as diplomatic channels are not completely blocked, Japan will never easily give up the attempt to obtain practical benefits through negotiations.</p>
<p>However, the only point on which the US and Japan agree is that neither side wants an immediate armed conflict. If actual problems are touched upon, then the US demands that Japan leave the Axis, abandon its policy of aggression, and stop advancing north or south. Japan's hope is that the "New Order" will be recognized, aid to China will be stopped, and the build-up of military forces in the South Seas by democratic countries will be restricted. The two sides are diametrically opposed, like fire and water. Even if we take a step back and say that both sides may be willing to make concessions, they are still far from reaching a compromise. Moreover, the consistent national policies of the two countries have absolutely nothing in common. If a compromise were to be reached, it would certainly be even more fragile than the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Wise authorities like the US would never fail to see this.</p>
<p>Apart from subjective reasons, the reason why the US and Japan are still able to engage in negotiations is that the international situation is unfavorable to Japan, and the US is anxious to deal with the European situation. This is why the turbulent Pacific can superficially form a moment of peace. If the overall situation changes slightly—the most important thing being the Soviet-German war—whether it improves or reverses, this temporary balance between the US and Japan will inevitably collapse, and the overall situation in the Far East will have a clearer development.</p>
<p>Amidst the Evacuation of Nationals in Various Parts of the Far East, the Number of American Citizens in Free China is Gradually Increasing, Recognizing China as a Safe Place for American Citizens to Reside, Sufficient Proof that Americans Have Good Feelings Towards China</p>
<p>Chongqing – At a time when the issue of evacuating American citizens from various parts of the Far East is becoming increasingly serious, there are still 800 to 900 American citizens residing in the Free China area, which is frequently bombed, and they are not considering evacuation. In fact, not only do missionaries come to the Free China area, but also American technicians, medical advisors, and other representatives come to assist China's war efforts. The exact number of American citizens currently residing in the Free China area is unknown, but according to the registration of American citizens on January 1, 1941, there were 840 people residing in the Kunming consular district, of which 620 were adults. Approximately 520 were employees of various Chinese government agencies, 12 were American merchants, and more than a dozen were journalists. This number does not include the personnel on the US gunboat Tutuila, which has three officers and approximately sixteen soldiers. Americans traveling in China at that time who did not register with the consulate are also not included in this number. It is estimated that the number of American citizens will increase to around 1,000 by the end of this year, as American medical delegations for the Yunnan-Burma Railway, aircraft mechanics, ground personnel, and pilots of the American Volunteer Group, as well as transportation experts and technicians for the Yunnan-Burma Road, will all come to China. Currently, the routes through which American citizens can freely travel to and from China are the Chongqing-Hong Kong route of China National Aviation Corporation. The planes on this route fly specifically in hazy and cloudy weather, cross the Japanese battle lines at night, fly without lights for guidance, and have very few emergency landing fields. The secondary routes are through Burma, either via the Chongqing-Yangon air route or via the Yunnan-Burma Road. In the future, there may be air routes through northern Burma to India to supplement them. There is also a possible entry and exit route via Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, which has air and land routes, but so far, only a small number of journalists and embassy officials have used this route. Many American citizens have found an informal route, that is, from the Japanese-occupied areas and coastal ports of China, through the battle lines of both the Japanese and Chinese sides. However, only a very few people have come by this route, and no one is known to have left by this route. At the same time, although Chinese cities, especially Chongqing, have been bombed for the longest period of time, American citizens have not suffered any casualties, and they have the greatest confidence to continue living here. Their fears about the future are actually less than those of American citizens in other parts of the Far East. American citizens here feel that even if war breaks out in the Pacific, Free China is still a safe place for American citizens to live and work. The wives of American citizens working in Free China have not expressed opposition to coming to Free China, and if allowed, most of the American citizens residing in Free China would like to bring their wives here. This shows a glimpse of their feelings. (United Press correspondent Fess, 24th)</p>
<p>American Freight Transportation Experts' Suggestions Adopted by the Government, Yunnan-Burma Road to Accelerate Freight Transportation, Excellent Skills of Chinese Drivers</p>
<p>Chongqing – The American freight transportation experts who came to Chongqing a few days ago have departed for their country after inspecting the Yunnan-Burma Road. Before leaving, they made concrete suggestions to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on how to improve freight transportation on the road. It is reported that one of the suggestions is that the Chinese customs at the border between China and Burma should work day and night to accelerate freight transportation. Previously, the customs only inspected goods during regular office hours, which resulted in vehicles and trucks arriving after office hours being delayed. Reuters has learned that the suggestions have been adopted by the Chinese government. After the new rules are implemented, freight transportation through the border will be continuous for 24 hours a day. Mr. Arnstein, the leader of the group of American experts, told his friends here that the saying that the Chinese cannot drive is completely unfounded. Their excellent driving skills are no less than those of any other people in the world. It is also reported that after Mr. Arnstein and his group return to their country, a large number of American transportation experts will come to China to assist in supervising freight transportation on the Burma Road.

<p>Foreign Exchange Control Commission to Start Operations Soon, Relevant Agencies Hastening to Formulate Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Chongqing – Preparations for the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Commission are nearing completion and it will start operations soon. Some of the agencies originally under the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee of the Ministry of Finance and the Trade Commission that handle foreign exchange-related matters will be transferred or merged into the Commission to unify authority. In addition, the relevant agencies are still working on formulating specific measures regarding China's foreign exchange policy and foreign trade after Britain and the US froze Chinese assets. However, they will be completed as soon as possible to avoid any disruption in the foreign exchange market. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong Chambers of Commerce to Investigate Southeast Asian Business</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in light of the outbreak of the war and the shortage of European and American goods in various parts of Southeast Asia, the general overseas Chinese are eager for Chinese products to be promoted there. Therefore, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce have jointly formed a Southeast Asian Business Investigation Group. The group will consist of 10 to 15 members and will be freely attended by the heads of major manufacturers. They will gather and depart from Hong Kong and will be responsible for their own expenses, but the government plans to provide them with appropriate subsidies. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>National Water Conservancy Commission to Start Operations Next Month</p>
<p>Chongqing – The National Water Conservancy Commission's provisional secretariat and general affairs departments will be headed by Ma Beihong and Song Kai, respectively. Song was originally the director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Commission is scheduled to start operations on the first of next month and will take over various water conservancy agencies. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Invading Chongyang Completely Repelled by Chinese Troops, Japanese Troops Invading Chaoan Suffer Setback, Chinese Troops Launch Successful Attack on Hengshan</p>
<p>Changsha – More than 2,000 Japanese troops from Chongyang in southern Hubei, with more than ten artillery pieces, invaded the southeastern area of Chongyang on the 19th. Chinese troops intercepted and attacked them in several directions, engaging in repeated charges and fierce fighting throughout the day, and finally completely repelled the Japanese troops.

<h3 id="e5">German-Finnish Forces Jointly Attack, Leningrad in Critical Danger, Red Army North of Kyiv Crosses the River and Retreats West, Fierce Fighting in the Odessa Region <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 24th - Yesterday, German forces intensified their siege of Leningrad and Odessa to commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and advanced to cut off Soviet troops heading towards the western coast. It is reported that the German-Finnish allied forces on the northern front are converging on Leningrad from all directions, with their vanguard less than twenty miles from the city. The German News Agency stated yesterday that German forces had defeated a Soviet cavalry unit, achieving a major victory. This cavalry unit initially attempted a counter-attack but was immediately surrounded. It is reported that over four thousand Soviet soldiers were annihilated, and over three thousand one hundred were captured. The agency also stated that the vanguard of the Finnish forces advancing in the Karelian Isthmus had crossed the old Soviet border, attacking the rear of the Soviet base of Vyborg. However, the German side acknowledged that Soviet resistance on that line was particularly strong.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 24th - The Soviet-German war has entered its ninth week. The main Red Army seems to be resisting the fierce German attacks on Leningrad, but Soviet leaders acknowledge that the northern city is in a dangerous situation. Soviet forces continue their strong resistance, countering German forces 75 miles southwest of Leningrad at Kingisepp and 120 miles south at Novgorod. On the Smolensk front, the Soviet offensive on the road to Moscow seems to be making progress, with German forces pushed back considerably. There is no new news regarding the battle of Gomel. The fierce battle in the Odessa area is currently at a stalemate, with Soviet forces heavily damaging the attacking Romanian troops. Neutral military experts say that Odessa is only surrounded by land, and sea routes are still open. The Red Army has ample supplies and materials, enabling it to sustain its fighting in the bend of the Dnieper River. The German claim of crossing the bend of the Dnieper River has not yet been verified here.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - Moscow Radio broadcasted a Soviet communiqué yesterday at midnight, stating that on August 23rd, fierce fighting continued across the entire front, especially in the Kingisepp, Smolensk, Novgorod, and Odessa areas. In the aerial battles of August 21st, nineteen German aircraft were shot down, with the loss of seventeen Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 24th - Responsible officials here declared this morning that the encirclement of Vyborg is shrinking due to the rapid advance of Finnish troops.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 24th - The National Broadcasting Company relayed a British Broadcasting Corporation report yesterday, stating that German and Romanian troops are within nine miles of Odessa.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Leader's Headquarters, 24th - This afternoon's German war report stated that German forces in Ukraine have occupied the bridgehead of Kakhovka. Northwest of Kyiv, enemy forces have been driven across the Dnieper River. Enemy forces south of Lake Ilmen have been defeated and are retreating. In addition to over 10,000 being captured, the remainder fled across the Lovat River. German forces operating in Estonia are pressing towards Tallinn, and Finnish forces continue to advance along the coast of Lake Ladoga.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 24th - News from the eastern front yesterday stated that the Soviet-German war is being conducted on a large scale. Berlin announced that German and Finnish troops have advanced towards Leningrad, preparing for a "destructive offensive," and that German forces are advancing on Odessa, charging Soviet positions with bayonets. However, both Leningrad and Odessa are still in Soviet hands. The fiercest fighting is concentrated on the Dnieper River front, extending approximately 800 miles from the Black Sea to the Gomel area. The German side claims to have breached the Soviet defense line, completing contact with Nazi troops in Ukraine. Soviet troops continue to mount fierce resistance in Ukraine west of the Dnieper River. Neither side has disclosed the exact locations of the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Central Red Army Launches Counter-Offensive, Recaptures Nine Towns and Villages in Two Days <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that Soviet forces are launching a counter-offensive in the central sector of the front, retaking nine villages in the past twenty-four hours. Although the German side has rushed reinforcements with tanks and artillery, the Soviet forces remain in an offensive position. According to the latest dispatches from the front, the Soviet counter-offensive is still progressing, with fierce fighting continuing. The German 161st Infantry Division has suffered heavy casualties in the past few days. General Konev's troops have captured fourteen artillery pieces, seven light artillery pieces, three tanks, six vehicles, and other light military equipment in forty-eight hours up to Friday. The nine villages retaken by the Soviet forces mostly have fortified positions, but the Soviet forces retook them in less than forty-eight hours, forcing the German forces to retreat westward. Soviet artillery and air forces are actively bombarding German tank forces. On August 21st, Soviet forces used heavy bombs to bomb German vehicles, artillery positions, and infantry units six times, destroying multiple German tanks and six artillery positions. In addition to General Konev's counter-offensive in the central sector, the German rear has also been repeatedly attacked by Soviet cavalry. Reports from all sides confirm that the Soviet troops who are resisting the German advance on Leningrad in the north and fighting in the Gomel area have strong morale.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 24th - According to the German official news agency, the battle for Odessa is currently extremely fierce. German infantry surrounding the port have captured very important strongholds. Two railway stations have been captured by German forces in hand-to-hand combat. Aided by Romanian tanks, German forces are advancing on Soviet positions, breaching their defensive line at a certain key point. Two Soviet transport ships west of Crimea were destroyed by German aircraft. The news agency also stated that in the central sector of the front, German forces engaged Soviet cavalry, with 4,000 Soviet soldiers killed and 3,150 captured, while 1,730 Soviet war horses were also seized. German aircraft have repeatedly attacked Murmansk in the north, with many hits on its docks, factories, and warehouses, while Soviet railways in the central sector have also been bombed by German aircraft.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 24th - On the southern front in the Odessa area, the Red Army has inflicted heavy damage on Romanian troops. After fighting, some Romanian divisions only have 20% to 25% of their manpower left. The Romanian army has also suffered heavy material losses. Some divisions have lost 60% to 80% of their machine guns, and their anti-tank guns have been completely destroyed. This is the situation for the Romanian 15th Division. From the 10th to the 17th, our army's repeated counter-offensives were effective. As a result of one week of fighting, the Romanian 15th Division was completely crushed.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Germany Eager to Make a Show Before Winter, Controls Waterways to Facilitate Prolonged Defense <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 24th - Local newspapers citing Berlin dispatches state that the German side now claims that its goal in the Soviet war is the long line along the Dvina River and the Volga River from Arkhangelsk to Astrakhan. After reaching this front, it will build barracks for a long-term defense in anticipation of next spring. Once the Soviet side loses this waterway, it will rely solely on the Siberian Railway for transportation. However, it is not something that can be accomplished in a short time for the German army to reach this front, as its offensive on Murmansk has not yet extended beyond the Riga River, and Leningrad and Moscow have not yet been captured. It is also said that General Budyonny's Soviet forces will defend the line east of the Dnieper River. The general opinion is that the purpose of the battle of Gomel is clearly to advance on Moscow. Finnish forces now claim to have occupied Kokkoselkä and controlled the entire bank of the Vuoksi River, 80 kilometers from Leningrad. It is expected that Finnish forces will advance in order to encircle Vyborg. It is reported that German forces are currently trying to resolve the Soviet forces that have retreated to the Prebellochye wetlands, but judging from the current situation, the Soviet forces have crushed this alleged German attempt.</p>

<p>United Press, New York, 24th - Two years ago yesterday, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a treaty stating that for ten years, the two countries would not engage in armed conflict or mutual aggression, including not joining other countries in aggressive treaties, either individually or collectively. Article 5 of the treaty stated, "If any disagreement arises between the signatory countries, the two countries will adjust their disputes independently and mutually with friendly attitudes or views. If deemed necessary, an arbitration committee may be formed to mediate." German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and thirty-two aides flew to Moscow at the time to sign the treaty, with a major ceremony held, and the Swastika flag and the Red flag were displayed together for the first time. The Nazis in Berlin believed that Britain and France were "willing to be inferior to the Kremlin" and were no longer able to "encircle" Germany. The two countries simultaneously announced the treaty on August 31st. The next day, Germany invaded Poland, and on September 3rd, Britain declared war on Germany. One year ago yesterday, German newspapers stated that "the German-Soviet agreement indicates peace in the East," and another German newspaper stated, "This agreement makes a German-Soviet war impossible." In January of last year, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a friendship treaty, the content of which was based on the facts that occurred after August 23, 1939. On May 1st, a German spokesman stated that German-Soviet friendship remained "unchanged," but on June 22nd, Germany launched an attack on the Soviet Union. The great war between Germany and the Soviet Union has erupted, and as of yesterday, the war has entered its third month.</p>

<p>United Press, London, 24th - Yesterday, news here stated that the Soviet Union expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's refusal to grant priority to the Soviet Union for the release of American war materials. The Soviet Union is also deeply puzzled by Britain's decision not to send an expeditionary force to launch a pincer attack on Germany from the European continent.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 24th - According to news from American newspapers, the Soviet Union is currently ordering war materials in the United States for delivery next spring in preparation for a long-term war. These orders will not be fully delivered until after eight months, indicating the Soviet Union's long-term war plans. There is also one thing that is most interesting, which is the Soviet Union's preparation for transporting tanks by air. The Soviet Union has now announced that all of its transport aircraft are larger than the American Douglas aircraft and can carry tanks weighing up to fifteen tons. The Soviet Union is not only preparing for the war eight months from now but will also adopt an offensive strategy. This further shows that the German claim of annihilating the Soviet army is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - According to the Asahi Shimbun last night, a dispatch from Los Angeles stated that multiple American and Soviet oil tankers may be escorted by American destroyers and Soviet warships and aircraft to Vladivostok to prevent attacks from the Axis powers. It is also learned that one Soviet oil tanker in the Black Sea and one American oil tanker in San Pedro loading aircraft fuel may also sail to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 24th - A member of the administrative authorities stated yesterday that the oil industry has been requested to provide another one hundred oil tankers to Britain. He said that a senior British official learned that the United States had directly transferred eighty oil tankers to Britain in the early stages of the war, about half of which had been sunk. However, the Maritime Commission stated that only forty-one oil tankers had been transferred.</p>

<p>TASS, Moscow, 24th - The Italian Stefani News Agency and the Hungarian Radio Station, under the instructions of Berlin, falsely claimed that "the Red Army is preparing to conduct large-scale chemical warfare," and said, "This has been confirmed by Soviet prisoners from the Ukrainian front." This is a malicious and provocative fabrication that is completely inconsistent with the facts and absolutely inaccurate.</p>

<p>Reuters, Mexico City, 24th - The Mexican government has withdrawn recognition of all German consuls residing in Mexico. According to official announcements, this action is in response to the German order to close all Mexican consulates in France. The Mexican government's official statement strongly emphasizes that Mexico does not recognize the situation currently caused by violence in Europe.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 24th - According to Geneva news transmitted by Moscow Radio, Germany has twice proposed to King Leopold of Belgium to restore him to the throne in order to quell the anti-resistance trend in Belgium, but Leopold has refused.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - According to Moscow Radio, the Germans in Belgium, unable to recruit Belgian volunteers to go to the eastern front, have become enraged and are conducting large-scale arrests. Young men in Mons and other towns have been listed, and houses have been searched. The Germans have even planted anti-Nazi propaganda in Belgian homes as an excuse for arrests. Many people were arrested while asleep at night and sent to concentration camps. Although the Germans have used threats and violence for days, the number of volunteers is still very small. These few Belgian volunteers have been given uniforms and equipment by the German side and transported to Germany to be transferred to the front. Some people gathered at the station and loudly cursed these volunteers, and several women stepped forward and slapped their faces directly.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - The Norwegian News Agency here received news from Norway stating that the German authorities in Norway not only find it difficult to manage the Norwegian people but also have trouble dealing with their own soldiers. German soldiers often take the opportunity to desert, as can be seen from the German commander's notice posted by the Kitering local police. It stated that residents must not allow deserting German officers to reside, provide them with food, clothing, or other assistance. If deserters are found, they should be immediately reported to the nearest police station. Those who do not comply will be punished under German military law. According to news from the Swedish border, forty German soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled into Sweden after hearing of the German attack on the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 4th - According to foreign official news from Zurich, of the 40,000 Slovak troops that Germany transferred to the front for combat, 30,000 have already been sent back, and the remaining portion is not being used on the front lines. The Commander-in-Chief of the Slovak Army has returned to Bratislava, and his issued communiqués have ceased. Although the newspapers under German control are propagating that Germany was forced to take this step because the Slovak army lacks training in mechanized warfare, the real reason is that a regiment of the Slovak army has defected and surrendered to the Soviet army, and other parts are fleeing whenever they have the chance.</p>

<p>International News Agency, London, 24th - London is showing considerable tension over the growing crisis in the Near East. If Iran does not heed the British and Soviet demand to expel the German Fifth Column, senior officials here are even anticipating that military action will be taken soon. The Sunday Express declared that the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, has requested the Turkish government to allow Nazi technical units to pass through Turkey to Iran. Travelers from Iran spoke of about thirty Soviet divisions concentrated on the Iranian border. However, British officials neither confirmed nor denied this.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Capital of Turkey, 23rd - Regarding the ultimatum presented by Britain, the Iranian government has submitted a reply. It is rumored that its content is to allow German technical personnel to be reasonably dismissed after their service contracts expire, but it is unwilling to immediately expel all German nationals and risk breaking off relations with Germany. At the same time, the Iranian government has made urgent defensive deployments and summoned 1,072 reserve officers to enlist and serve in the border military districts.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Capital of Turkey, 23rd - Britain previously sent a note to the Iranian government, giving it until the end of this month to expel all German people from the country. It is learned that this deadline expired on the 19th of this month. People from all walks of life do not believe that the Iranian government can accept this request, at least not in this way. Currently, the Iranian government is waiting for the British side to respond to the reply. In addition, it is learned that British troops are currently concentrating in the border areas of Iraq and Iran, and a large number of reinforcements are being sent from Syria.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 24th - The situation in Iran remains serious. It is rumored that the Iranian reply, which is currently under consideration in London, has failed to improve the situation. However, Iran has made a concession to Britain, which is to stop the activities of the Rashid Ali faction, which is actively promoting cooperation with representatives of the Axis powers. It is estimated that there are 3,000 Germans in Iran, but the Iranian government only admits to 690 German nationals. It is likely that the Iranian government is not fully aware of the extent of German penetration, because many Germans bribed officials upon entry without reporting their entry, so there is no way to verify them with the central registry. The secret entry of Germans has increased the Axis powers' threat to Iran. Germany is eager to repeat the internal collapse tactic in Iran that was not successful in Iraq. A look at the map shows the severity of this threat. If Germany occupies Iran, it can endanger the Caucasus, India, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf, and affect the future oil supply to Iran and other places. Egyptian public opinion all leans towards the Allied powers, so they do not sympathize with Iran's support for the Axis powers. Iran is the Shia sect in Islam, while Egypt is the Sunni sect.</p>
<p>Iran's Policy Adheres to Neutrality, People Willing to Back the King</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - The Iranian capital said last night via radio that the whole country of Iran is now supporting the King, willing to obey his will and take any necessary actions for the benefit of the country. Iran's policy has always been strict neutrality. Whether in peacetime or wartime, the King's policy is to improve the domestic social situation and not interfere in foreign disputes. Turkey has an understanding attitude towards Iran, which is greatly appreciated, because Turkish newspapers call Iran's current policy wise. Iran's wishes are concentrated on improving the status of its people.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 23rd - Local newspapers recently carried news from Berlin that the German Foreign Ministry has confirmed that negotiations between France and Germany have been very active in recent days. However, political figures remain silent about the subject of the negotiations, only saying that these negotiations are commonplace and have been held periodically since the signing of the Franco-German armistice agreement, and have never been interrupted.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Capital of Switzerland, 23rd - According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the Journal de Genève, rumors are spreading that a compromise may be reached in the European war, and that there are talks of Germany and France concluding a peace treaty. The German Foreign Ministry has denied these rumors, saying that the Franco-German armistice agreement is the only treaty between the German government and France. As long as Germany is at war with Britain, this treaty will remain in effect. However, contact between Germany and France has been frequent recently, and the Wiesbaden armistice commission signs various measures related to cooperation between the two sides almost daily. In short, what the armistice commission is most concerned about at present is the security of the French Empire and its industry.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 24th - The Vichy Cabinet held two meetings yesterday, and then the Minister of the Interior hosted French and foreign journalists, discussing various domestic issues.

<h3 id="e25">Government Incentivizes the Transfer of Funds Inland: Foreign Exchange Assets Can Be Unfrozen; The Bank of China Purchases Foreign Currency Drafts at Market Prices; Foreign Exchange Still Supplied at Market Prices for Legitimate Uses; American Overseas Chinese in China Can Exchange Funds for Legal Tender at Market Prices <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the freezing of Chinese funds abroad by the British and Americans, how should the overseas deposits of Chinese nationals be unfrozen? How should foreign exchange needed by Chinese merchants be supplied? And how should it be made easier for American expatriates in China who hold foreign bank checks and drafts to exchange them for legal tender? These are all matters of concern to the public. An inquirer has learned from the Ministry of Finance that the spokesperson of the Ministry has issued the following statement: In order to incentivize the transfer of funds inland, the Chinese government will allow the Central Bank to unfreeze the foreign exchange assets of both Chinese and foreign nationals in the country. The measures are as follows: (1) If foreign currency drafts or bank deposit slips are brought to the bank for sale, the bank will purchase them at market prices. The price for U.S. dollars is 5 and 5/16 (i.e., 18.81 yuan of legal tender per U.S. dollar), the price for British pounds is 5 and 3/32 (i.e., 76.04 yuan of legal tender per British pound), the price for rupees is 17 and 1/2 (i.e., 5.71 yuan of legal tender per rupee), and the price for Hong Kong dollars is 21 (i.e., 4.76 yuan of legal tender per yuan). Personal checks must be guaranteed by a bank. (2) Individuals can transfer their foreign exchange to the bank and open a new account in the original currency. When withdrawing, they must apply in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and will be paid in the original currency. As for merchants who need foreign exchange for legitimate purposes, the bank will still supply it at the aforementioned purchase market prices, but they must complete the application procedures and submit them along with the contract invoice, customs import certificate, or tax payment receipt, as well as a document from the relevant authority, to the bank for review. The imported goods must not conflict with the Ministry's regulations on prohibited imports. U.S. deposits held by American expatriates in China are also subject to freezing under U.S. law, unless otherwise stipulated by permit. Currently, American cultural, charitable, and religious undertakings in China, such as schools, hospitals, and churches, as well as Americans permitted to travel in China who hold U.S. dollars or letters of credit from American banks, have a great need for legal tender. In order to facilitate these institutions and individuals, the Ministry has also notified the Central Bank to accept their U.S. dollars or checks and drafts and exchange them for legal tender at market prices for their use so that they will not encounter any difficulties.

<h3 id="e26">Journey in the Southwest Sky (1) Hong Kong · Chongqing · Kunming · Lashio <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The American "Collier's Weekly" recently published an article by Mrs. Hemingway about air travel, detailing her experiences on the way from Hong Kong to Chongqing, then from Chongqing to Kunming, and finally to Lashio. The author's writing is sharp and her observations are accurate. Readers will be able to appreciate it without further explanation.</p>
<p>Flying in Wind and Rain</p>
<p>It is 4:30 in the morning, and the cold wind is biting as passengers cross the sea to the Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. The four sides of the airport are brightly lit, and you can see the silver Douglas DC-2 aircraft parked in the center, with large black characters painted on its wings. The English letters "CNAO" are on the right wing, and five-foot-square Chinese characters: "China National Aviation Corporation" are on the left. Around the airport are green mountains three thousand feet high, but you can't see anything in the dark. Eight passengers found their seats in the dimly lit cabin and fastened their seatbelts.</p>
<p>The weather forecast said that the pilot would ascend to five hundred feet with a visibility of two hundred miles, and that there would be thunderstorms ahead. This is good flying weather for the China National Aviation Corporation aircraft. American airlines never allow aircraft to fly out of airports surrounded by four mountains in this kind of weather. We started to take off, and the aircraft body slid and swayed in the wind. We will fly over Japanese positions at night, crossing mountains with a height of nine thousand two hundred feet. If we are forced to land due to adverse conditions, there are no plains here for landing. The distance to Chongqing is seven hundred and seventy miles.</p>
<p>The aircraft circled upwards, flying high above the safe area of Hong Kong. The city of Hong Kong gradually became smaller, becoming a crescent-shaped island below us. The mountains surrounding the port were flickering with lights. There were brightly lit ships in the port, and the flickering lights of civilian ships. The DC-2 aircraft gradually ascended, and the light from the city and the water became tilted and jumping. Then Hong Kong disappeared from view, and the aircraft was surrounded by white clouds. The Chinese passengers covered themselves with blankets and sat quietly in their seats, dozing off. You can hear the sound of the aircraft moving forward, and you can hear the howling wind. We have ascended to thirteen thousand feet above Hong Kong. The red and green lights on the wings were now turned off.</p>
<p>Now the aircraft is in the dark high altitude, and the flashing light of the gas emitted from the tail illuminates the drifting clouds around it. The shape of the clouds has changed, they are not sparse and soft; the structure of the clouds is like stone, rising in front of the aircraft like a wall, and the aircraft seems to be flying on the edge of a sandstone. The letters on the wings are blurred and eventually nothing can be seen. The aircraft is flying downwards in absolute darkness.</p>
<p>At five o'clock, we encountered a thunderstorm. Several Chinese people were still asleep. The weather was very cold, and an American military officer who was coming to China for the first time on this aircraft looked at us all with a wry smile, because there was nothing he could do. You naturally believe that nothing will go wrong with the aircraft. Once you are in the aircraft, you are part of it, and you must always trust it.</p>
<p>The DC-2 aircraft was vibrating in the storm, so we fastened our seatbelts again to avoid bumping into the two people in front of us or falling on the floor. Hail hit the wings and fuselage, making a sound like a threshing machine, and lightning flashed dimly in the clouds. You hold the chair with both hands, and support your body with your feet, so that you are sitting firmly on the chair. Thin ice formed on the engine and wings, and the aircraft gradually ascended. It has reached above the clouds. If it cannot reach the top of the clouds at an altitude of sixteen thousand feet, the pilot will have to fly back. There is no de-icing equipment on the aircraft.</p>
<p>An hour later, we had flown out of the storm area, but the surrounding clouds were still as thick as cream. The pilot ran into the cabin to tell the American military officer that the airspeed indicator was frozen in the storm. The American military officer smiled, nodded, and shook hands with him. The pilot said that fortunately, it didn't matter; he pushed the window open an inch and looked at the speed of the wind to measure the speed of the aircraft. He often tried this measurement.</p>
<p>On the Way to Chongqing and Yunnan</p>
<p>The aircraft was circling in the air, preparing to land. Although the ground could not be seen at this time, the visibility in Chongqing was now two hundred and fifty meters. For the convenience of blind landing, the China National Aviation Corporation pilots used German-style direction finding radio. This type of radio wave can automatically adjust the frequency of the transmitter to match the frequency of any long-wave radio station, so that the longitude and latitude are known to what degree. The coil of the direction finder can be rotated in any direction, and the degree on the inspection compass can be known in this direction.</p>
<p>But all the passengers suddenly saw a river and a series of uneven brown mountains in the gaps of the clouds. The pilot slowly rotated the aircraft and descended. The surrounding clouds had disappeared. We were very close to the ground, and we could see clothes drying in the square, the ruins after the bombing, and thousands of Chinese people walking hurriedly on mountain paths or streets. Chongqing looked like there were many scattered rural villages, distributed in a circle of mountain valleys, with the emerald green and brown Yangtze River flowing in the center. We were flying over the roofs of houses, over the Yangtze River, and were about to land at Chongqing Airport. The Chongqing Airport is 1,900 feet long and 100 feet wide and is located on a narrow island in the heart of the river, surrounded by mountains, all above 3,500 feet high. This island is submerged in water sixty feet twice a year, and in the best season it is like a mudflat in the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we drank tea at the Chongqing Airport, waiting for the weather report. We were about to set off to Kunming immediately, but the weather was too good. Everyone hated the clear sky and sunlight. In such good weather, Japanese aircraft could fly out of the Yue Liang base and attack Kunming. We still had to arrive at Lashio on the Burmese border tonight. The pilot Roy decided not to mind the Japanese aircraft bombing, and wanted to arrive in Kunming at dusk. Japanese aircraft would not drop bombs at night.</p>
<p>The fields seemed to undulate up and down the mountainside, and the shapes of the fields were different. From the air, we looked like strange flower petals. The crops were illuminated by the sunlight, and the fields were purple, gray, green, and yellow. We flew very low and saw everything. The weather was particularly good, and we could still enjoy the scenery. Roy said, "I picked what I thought was the more promising route." In order to suit the weather conditions, he created a new flight route. In fact, seventeen Japanese aircraft were prepared to fly back before we flew over Kunming.</p>
<p>Roy said, "You have to know that there is actually no place to land on this flight line." Looking down from the aircraft, you can only see crisscrossing paths, high mountains, and narrow riverbeds. Behind us, there is also an endless range of mountains. You can't see these when you are in the dark or passing through the clouds, but the mountains and rivers will always exist.</p>
<p>Looking north, the mountains are rocky and towering to the sky, and snow still remains on the peaks. To the south, there are endless mountains, continuous and a beautiful purple color.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Portraits of the Three Leading Figures of the British Cabinet <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>In addition to Prime Minister Churchill, the British wartime cabinet also includes three leading figures: one is the Minister of Supply, Lord Beaverbrook, who went to the United States this time to negotiate for armaments, one is the Minister of Labour, Bevin, and one is the Home Secretary, Morrison. They are introduced below.</p>
<p>Lord Beaverbrook is squatting at his desk, ready to jump up. After several months of his urging, his desk has become the focus of the world's attention. Most British cabinet members work in drab rooms with old desks and faded pictures on the walls. From the windows, they can only see blank walls of the Victorian era, palatial buildings, or dark squares.</p>
<p>Only the first Minister of Aircraft Production and the current Minister of Supply is different. His office is located in a high place, so he can see far and wide and overlook London. When he roars in a strange voice, "We must quickly get the aircraft into the air!" The solemn posture makes his words particularly vivid and powerful. He has only one posture when he speaks, raising his arms and shaking his hands, as if asking God to rebuke those who are hesitant and cowardly.</p>
<p>His right hand is shaking towards the window, and his left hand is hovering between four telephones, while his eyes are staring at an unexploded time bomb in the center of the desk. What kind of person is this Beaverbrook, who bears the heavy responsibility of building as many aircraft as possible?</p>
<p>He is completely different from what you might have imagined in the past. He has rewarded two cartoonists, Low and Strube, for drawing an old man who always grins grotesquely for many years. From his self-run newspaper, you can see his character, which seems to be crude and quick, having just run over from the Western Hemisphere, unfamiliar with British etiquette, but able to work hard. But millions of people still regard him as a "press eccentric," which is originally a contemptuous tone among the British.</p>
<p>First, he is not a small man. He is majestic in stature, as tall as five feet eight inches. He rarely grins, which damages his elegance, and he has a gentle temperament and is very handsome, so even though his voice is hoarse, it feels gentle and pleasant.</p>
<p>Although he comes from Canada, he is actually Scottish, but he was born in Canada. Even if he opposes this statement, it is a fact. He has not spent many years in Canada in his active life, but mostly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Although he was honored with the title of nobility, he has long regretted accepting it, otherwise he could have said in the House of Commons today, "Didn't I tell you all thirty years ago?" Originally, he had been elected as a Member of Parliament in 1910.</p>
<p>His experience has increased with age. The mischievous Max (Beaverbrook's nickname) has changed into Sir Beaverbrook, but this is not his first time participating in the cabinet. As early as 1918, he had already served as the first Minister of Information. This time, he was called by Prime Minister Churchill to join the cabinet again, after an interval of twenty years.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly tried to break away from the newspaper owner, but has not been able to fulfill his wish. He owns three newspapers, each with a different format. Those three newspapers are the "Daily Express," the "Evening Standard," and the "Sunday Express." Beaverbrook does not make them completely follow his own intentions. He is only a major contributor and leader, not a dictator.</p>
<p>For those who are competent, he does not hesitate to grant full authority in order to make the most of their talents. This policy has not changed to this day. Once, someone criticized him for expressing opinions that were different from the tone of his newspaper, and he replied, "Although I have read these newspapers, the words in them are not entirely written by me!" There was also a period when deliberately opposing his claims was the most reliable way, and the cartoonist Low achieved great success in this way. He satirized everything that Beaverbrook was fond of, even the sacred and inviolable imperial free trade was attacked in the same way. Many people still think that this is Beaverbrook's greatest and most amazing skill in running a newspaper.</p>
<p>From May 14, 1940, he has been sitting at the desk designated by Churchill. With his talent and knowledge, he may be able to determine the victory or defeat of the war. He sits at the desk, sometimes pondering, sometimes roaring. People in the outer corridors and passages talk about this minister in a respectful tone, just like they talked about his father years ago, but suddenly, this leading figure in the wartime cabinet will let out a shout, interrupting their conversation, he shouted: "My friends, I want to tell you what you should do, I want you to do it today, I want you to go to that factory right now, I want you to convey my words to them!"</p>
<p>Where is his secret? What is his job like? Did he succeed? Years ago, the cartoonist Low often painted Max as a "robber baron, wearing a coat, a wide-brimmed hat, with feathers inserted on it, and a short sword hanging from his waist. Beaverbrook liked this satire very much, so he hired Low. Now that he is sitting at the desk of the Minister of Supply, he looks just like a robber baron.</p>
<p>The situation of the British aircraft industry was very precarious at first. British aircraft, British designs, and British technicians and workers are the best in the world. But there is one major shortcoming: the number of aircraft manufactured is insufficient. Because about thirty aircraft companies are each acting independently, without any connection, and all manufacturing according to their own models. They don't seem to know that the whole world is in danger of collapsing, and they are all based on the "balanced production" of peacetime.</p>
<p>When Beaverbrook first arrived at Fleet Street "that is, London's newspaper street," he expressed contempt for "rabbit cage-style" rooms. At that time, newspapers were edited in dozens of small rooms, but Beaverbrook gathered all the editors into one room. When a newcomer comes in, they can't tell who is the editor-in-chief and who is the assistant. This is indeed not very comfortable, but it has great success where speed is needed.</p>
<p>Beaverbrook's first slogan after taking office as Minister of Aircraft Production was: "I don't want balanced production! I want to abolish balance! I want the manufacture of aircraft to be rapid! I don't want balanced production!" So this robber baron placed the aircraft industry on a unified basis. Since the Emergency Defence Act granted him power, he had great power and sent his subordinates to all parts of the country. Depending on the urgency of the need, he transferred aluminum from one factory to another, or took the aircraft frames and parts from one factory and handed them over to another factory that needed them more urgently. He soon applied the methods he used in factories to his subordinates. His methods were sometimes sincere, sometimes stern, and sometimes deliberately cunning, used in a mixed way, making it unpredictable, and even those who suffered the greatest blows had to endure with a smile, unless they flung their sleeves and left, otherwise they could only continue to work patiently.</p>
<p>According to his subordinates, the first slogan he shouted was: "We do not intend to eliminate the red tape in the department. We don't need to do this. We just have to step over this red tape without having to eliminate it." The first determination he showed when he took office was to reject all personal publicity. He told himself that his position was very delicate and he had to be cautious and self-protective (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Application of Scientific Methods in Education Over the Past Forty Years - Academic Lecture Yesterday's Eighth Public Speech - Chen Xuan Shan, Director of Chinese Education Department, Gave the Lecture <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The academic lecture initiated by the eight elders of this city held its ninth public lecture at the Majestic Theatre at 10 am yesterday. The lecturer was Dr. Chen Xuan Shan, and the topic was "The Application of Scientific Methods in Education Over the Past Forty Years." First, Mr. Zhu Xi Xuan delivered a speech on behalf of the chairman of the lecture series, briefly stating that the academic lecture series, at the request of various primary and secondary school teachers during the summer vacation, invited experts to lecture on various issues in education, winning public praise. Today, we are very grateful to Dr. Chen for coming to give a lecture. Dr. Chen is a famous modern philosopher and educator. He studied at Columbia University in the United States in his early years and obtained a doctorate in philosophy. After returning to China, he served as the dean of the Education Department of Great China University and as a professor at various universities. He is currently the director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He has rich writings and profound knowledge. On this day, the audience who came to listen to his lecture was very crowded. Mr. Chen's explanation was thorough, and the listeners were all attentive. Mr. Chen first explained the meaning of scientific methods.</p>
<p>What is Meant by Scientific Methods</p>
<p>(1) Scientific method respects facts. The handling of any problem must be based on facts and must not be mixed with the slightest personal subjective bias. (2) The scientific method is analytical. It involves first analyzing a problem with complex content and broad scope into several small problems, and then solving them separately. However, this method sometimes falls into errors, because the analyzed items often cannot represent the whole picture. However, this is not entirely the fault of the analytical method itself, but rather whether its application is reasonable. (3) The scientific method tests objective facts to seek results and is not affected by personal interests or prejudices in solving problems. (4) The scientific method applies past experience to establish a hypothesis and uses a lot of data to prove the truth of this hypothesis. (5) Scientific method adopts quantitative methods to organize data. The description of each thing must be limited in degree. In short, the steps of the scientific method are to observe facts, establish a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, identify the problem, collect data, and then conduct subjective and objective considerations, and then collect new data for explanation, and finally find the correct theory.</p>
<p>The History of Application in Education</p>
<p>Next, the history of the application of scientific methods in education is briefly described. From the perspective of educational theories and systems, the application of scientific methods in education began forty years ago, around 1900. Taking children's education as an example, the first person to apply scientific methods to study children's education was an American educator, who published the research results of children's development in 1880. Later, some people studied psychological tests. By 1909, the development of educational tests had achieved great success. In 1898, there were also statistical methods in animal experimental education, which progressed very rapidly. In 1909, a famous educator, Aires, used statistical laws to study the problem of students repeating grades. In short, in the forty years since the scientific method was applied to education, it has made great contributions. Many achievements have been produced by scientific methods, and some traditional misconceptions have been overturned. The traditional concept that the learning ability of adults is not as strong as that of children has been overthrown. According to research and testing results, the learning ability of adults and children is comparable. Although the application of scientific methods to education may fall into the trap of being limited to formal training, it is only in this way that it can be improved. In short, scientific methods have made many good contributions to education over the past forty years, but we cannot be satisfied with this and must continue to seek progress.</p>
<p>Research Methods in Education</p>
<p>Next, it also mentioned "Research on Scientific Methods in Education," saying: (1) Use historical research methods to refer to past facts to improve various facilities in the future. (2) Investigating facts to serve as research data is the most practical need. (3) Paying attention to experimental methods is very ideal in theory, but in practice, because the process of education is extremely complex, and the people who use this method have not been completely rational, so this method has not yet seen any success.</p>
<p>Future Achievements Still Require Effort</p>
<p>It is said that, in summary, in the past forty years, scientific methods have enabled most people engaged in education to develop an objective attitude, so that they will not make hasty judgments on any problem, and what they say must be based on something. However, the research tools still need to be improved, and the scope of research should be expanded. Especially regarding the development of children, such as the stages of development of children's intelligence, there is still no unified conclusion, which is very regrettable. Furthermore, whether education belongs to science or not has not yet been concluded. Some say that education is not science but art. All of these are urgent problems that need to be solved and are quite interesting.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Children's Library has decided to make slight changes to the original opening hours, as the various primary schools in Shanghai have now started one after another, which inevitably conflicts with the original opening hours, so as to ensure that children's extracurricular reading does not interfere with school hours. However, how to change it will be decided next week. In addition, the library's children's patrol reading has not yet been implemented. It is reported that it may be implemented next month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Children's Singing Contest organized by "Children's News," a high-quality domestic children's newspaper, has received enthusiastic participation since registration began. Many schools have also universally selected outstanding children to participate, in order to increase children's interest in singing. They have requested the newspaper to postpone the date of the event. It has now been decided to change it to the sixth floor of the New Shanghai Company on Nanjing Road on the morning of September 14th (Sunday), and the registration date will be extended to September 5th. Musicians Chen Gexin and others have been hired as judges. In addition, the combined issue of the newspaper, issues 64 and 65, was originally approved to be published today, but has now been postponed due to the city-wide printing strike.</p>
<h3 id="e31">School News <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>

Most of the hired teachers are graduates of famous universities in China and have rich teaching experience. Recently, the school has seen that the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day. In order to help poor and studious students, in addition to the special donation of the Shenbao Scholarship at the second part of Hartung Road, a total of seven students from senior and junior high schools can be exempted from paying all tuition fees, which has been published in Shenbao yesterday. In addition, a number of free and half-price places for the poor and scholarships have been added to each grade to provide universal relief and benefit the scholars. The final recruitment has been scheduled for the 27th of this month. In recent days, students have been registering one after another, but the number of places in each grade is limited. Those who are interested in studying at the school should go to register as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Re-estimating the Exchange Rate on the Foreign Exchange Black Market <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Liu</p>
<p>On July 26th, the United States ordered the freezing of funds from China and Japan, and Britain and the Netherlands also adopted parallel measures. After this information spread to Shanghai, most writers took it at face value, believing that this was an opportunity to eliminate the black market. The only reason was based on the interpretation of "freezing," believing that once funds were frozen, the buyer would have no way to sell them, and since trading was eliminated, the foreign exchange black market would naturally not exist. This was considered a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>Principles and Facts are Completely Different</p>
<p>However, in fact, transactions on the foreign exchange black market did not change due to the implementation of the freezing measures. At the same time, the foreign exchange market in Shanghai did not show any signs of "freezing." Therefore, almost all articles written based on the principle of freezing were completely wrong. Generally speaking, it is not a surprising thing that facts do not match guesses. However, under the topic of freezing funds, the mismatch between theory and facts is really not an error in the interpreter's understanding, but because there was fundamentally no "freezing" in fact. Since there was no "freezing," how could it affect the actual future development? Some people doubted why the black market continued to exist, and at the same time suspected that there was a reason why the black market could not be eliminated. Their misunderstandings all came from reason.</p>
<p>In this way, although the licenses of certain firms continued to be publicly displayed, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai, in addition to speculators continuing to trade according to their own predictions, did not have any major changes. On August 18th, the Exchange Equalization Fund officially decided in Hong Kong to provide approved black market foreign exchange at an exchange rate of 5.34375 yuan to the US dollar. At the same time, it announced that to apply for foreign exchange, it was necessary to obtain approval from Hong Kong in accordance with the prescribed procedures. In this way, in the foreign exchange black market, there was a distinction between approved and unapproved foreign exchange. Those who were approved applied to the Exchange Equalization Fund according to the listed price, and those who were not approved went to the black market to purchase it themselves. Although the listed price remained at the original price this week, the actual transaction price in the black market still rose and fell according to supply and demand. In general, its exchange rate was tighter than the listed price. For example, on August 18th, the listed price of the foreign exchange black market was 5.3125 yuan, while the actual transaction price was 5.03125 yuan, a difference of 32.9 cents.</p>
<p>Exchange Equalization Measures Open Up One Side</p>
<p>There is no way to know the method adopted by the Exchange Equalization Fund for the foreign exchange black market, but based on the situation of the foreign exchange market, it can be inferred that the Exchange Equalization Fund's policy, as of now, is:</p>
<p>(1) Divide China's foreign exchange policy into two parts, one part is the rear, and the other part is Shanghai. The rear part is subject to strict foreign exchange control policy adopted by the Ministry of Finance, with an exchange rate of 7.5 yuan to the US dollar. The Shanghai part is responsible for the same approval system by the Exchange Equalization Fund, with an exchange rate of 5.3125 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Although there is a listed price in the black market, because the United States has not actually frozen the funds, it is still allowed to buy and sell on its own. The market price of this transaction is the actual transaction price of the black market.</p>
<p>(3) The Exchange Equalization Fund still adopts a maintenance system for the transaction price of the foreign exchange black market (this estimate is based on the inexhaustible short position in the black market) and seeks its balance through buying and selling.</p>
<p>Therefore, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai after the freezing can be said to be a relatively regulated control method. This method may be influenced by the British and American freezing measures, but it is not within the scope of the freezing measures.</p>
<p>In this way, although the foreign exchange black market has undergone certain changes in form, in essence, it has not changed in the slightest as a loophole in China. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>First, the so-called foreign exchange market is a concentration camp for capital flight and capital outflow, which is an undisputed fact. To block this loophole, it is necessary to adopt a strict foreign exchange control policy, at least to restrict the past free buying and selling methods; the freezing of funds, in principle, is likely to eliminate the black market, because if the funds can be actually frozen, the free buying and selling rights and movement rights of foreign exchange owners will naturally be subject to considerable restrictions, but now that the foreign exchange black market continues to exist, the foreign exchange loophole also still exists.</p>
<p>Second, the total sum of foreign exchange resources, whether flowing out of the rear or the black market, and whether paid on the Ministry of Finance's account or the Exchange Equalization Fund's account, its income is the entire Chinese foreign capital, and its loss is the entire Chinese foreign debt. The more resources that flow out of the foreign exchange black market, the less foreign exchange reserves can be maintained for the Shanghai black market listed price and the Chongqing commercial listed price. Therefore, the outflow on the black market is the same as the waste on the approval. In other words, the existence of the black market reduces the effectiveness of any control measures.</p>
<p>Third, based on China's foreign trade situation, the international balance of payments is in deficit rather than surplus. If this continues, the foreign exchange fund, no matter how sufficient, will have a day of exhaustion. To strengthen the strength of the foreign exchange fund, on the one hand, efforts should be made to suppress the consumption of foreign exchange, and on the other hand, the resources of foreign exchange should be increased. In terms of trade, in principle, a balance of imports and exports must be sought. In terms of quality, trade products must be classified and treated separately, so that the reduction of imports will not have a serious impact on the general national life. According to the future work and tasks of the Exchange Equalization Fund, there is no reason to listen to the existence of the black market.</p>
<p>The Key Lies in Politics</p>
<p>However, the foreign exchange black market still exists now. Some people think that this is the proper article for ending previous transactions, or that this is the precursor to the elimination of the black market, which are all wrong. The only reason is the phenomenon caused by the fact that the funds have not been frozen.</p>
<p>The general public overemphasizes aid to China in their understanding of the nature of the freezing measures, which makes them even more unable to understand this issue. The United States' freezing measures are essentially a kind of strategy towards the outside world. The main goal is to control Japan, and relatively, it is beneficial to China. Its side effects are to affect the exchange market. The freezing measures are not strict, not because British and American banks do not know the freezing steps, but to illustrate that the relationship between the United States and Japan has not reached a serious and decisive stage. If you think that the freezing was announced for the sake of the legal tender or the legal tender foreign exchange, it will make them even more misunderstood.</p>
<p>Although this is the case in fact, but from China's standpoint, since the United States has already been asked to freeze part of China's funds, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of this measure, it is necessary to request the implementation of freezing steps. Because according to the current method, although it has some impact on foreign exchange speculation, it has very little improvement in foreign exchange policy. As for leaving our intended goals, it is naturally even further away.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Aftermath of the Exchange Market <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shixian</p>
<p>As of now, what effect have the U.S. and British freezing of Chinese funds had? Not a single ideal result has been seen; there have been many unexpected results. The first is to create a black market within the black market of the exchange market. The second is to create an opportunity for further tightening of the already tight original black exchange rate.</p>
<p>Three Major Farces</p>
<p>Although it is said that the U.S. government has entrusted fourteen allied banks in Shanghai and four national banks in China to handle the review and supply, they are difficult to implement at present not only because there are no detailed implementation rules; and because the drafts that have not been reviewed can be bought as usual in Shanghai and can be collected and paid as usual in the U.S.; the emergence and existence of the black market within the black market is extremely natural.</p>
<p>Although it is said that the review system is being actively arranged, and the date of its realization may be imminent. But only doing review and supply, without a withholding freeze, will only cause the Exchange Equalization Fund to lose its funds. The newly generated export drafts that the Exchange Equalization Fund may obtain will instead become a supply resource for the black market within the black market. Even the drafts that the Exchange Equalization Fund supplies through review may inevitably become a supply force for the black market within the black market.</p>
<p>Although it is said that U.S. commercial banks only pay legal tender to foreign exchange depositors at the black price when they come to deposit and withdraw, and refuse to pay foreign exchange. But at present, this method only increases the degree to which demand exceeds supply in the black market within the black market. Moreover, interestingly, U.S. commercial banks still send these settled drafts to the black market in the exchange market for sale. And they must wait until the exchange rate in the black market within the black market is tighter than the price they gave before selling them. Therefore, it further strengthens the disadvantage of the tightening exchange rate in the black market within the black market. Without discussing its impact on the future of Sino-U.S. trade, just looking at this method itself, it seems to be a bit of a "only the state magistrate is allowed to set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps" authoritarianism.</p>
<p>The Lowest Aftermath Method</p>
<p>Letting the black market exist means that the unification and stability of the exchange rate cannot be achieved, and even political goals such as preventing arbitrage become pipe dreams. Freezing and control should be as strict as possible, but now it seems to be increasing the negative impact of the loophole, which is certainly not a fundamental mistake. The problem is only that the farce is too high. Therefore, the first thing to do is to find a way to eliminate this farce, and the second is to pay attention to emphasizing the implementation methods of review and supply. The American and British members of the Foreign Exchange Exchange Equalization Fund Committee have already come to Shanghai one after another; and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has resumed its original activities since last week. We have many reasons to believe that the current farce</p>
<h3 id="e42">News and Knowledge of the Bond Market (Continued and Completed) <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Notes by Mr. Zhang Yifan and Mr. Chen Jun</p>
<p>——Textbook for "Business News" at the School of Commerce, University of Shanghai——</p>
<p>Formula for Calculating Public Bond Interest:</p>
<p>Purchasing public bonds is an investment for individuals and a contribution to the country. However, the buying and selling of issued public bonds is merely the transfer of creditor's rights among bondholders, and does not contribute to the country's financial income. Therefore, to achieve the dual significance of personal investment and national service, one must purchase newly issued national public bonds.</p>
<p>Since China has had bonds and public bonds, a public bond market has arisen accordingly. During the Northern Expedition, the prices of various bonds were often only 40% of their face value. After the Northern Expedition, the national government sincerely reorganized, and creditworthiness improved daily, with market prices rising accordingly. As market prices rose, the discount on the issuance of new bonds could be increased, and losses to the national treasury could be reduced. Before the August 13th Incident, the Ministry of Finance, seeing the speculation in various public bonds and the soaring prices, had to implement a minimum price limit policy. It stipulated that Grade A bonds should not be lower than 76.0 yuan, Grade B bonds not lower than 73.5 yuan, Grade C bonds not lower than 71.5 yuan, and Grades D and E bonds should not be lower than 70.0 yuan. At that time, the market prices of various bonds were still 3-4 yuan to more than 10 yuan higher than this price limit. After the outbreak of the war, the stock exchange was ordered to close. Subsequently, a black market emerged. Initially, the unofficial trading prices of various bonds were almost halved compared to pre-war levels, but later gradually recovered. As of today, the pre-war situation has been restored.</p>
<p>Public bonds are not only a reliable investment target for the people but also an excellent way for financial institutions to manage their funds. This is because the bond interest rate is much higher than the deposit interest rate and is extremely reliable. If cash is needed urgently, it can be sold at any time, making it extremely convenient for circulating funds. Therefore, public bonds are often an important part of the payment reserves of various banks.</p>
<p>The unified bonds are currently scheduled to pay interest and principal once every January and July. Principal is repaid by lottery. Those who win the lottery receive the full amount of principal. Because various sectors of the city invest heavily in public bonds, each repayment of principal and interest often temporarily increases the amount of currency in circulation in the city. This is certainly not safe in today's speculative frenzy, so it has now been changed to pay the principal and interest in six installments each time. If funds are collected at the Ministry of Finance's location, a one-time payment can be made. In the month before each repayment of principal and interest, the market prices of various bonds tend to rise higher than usual. Once the repayment of principal and interest period has passed, on the first day of February and August, the market price is reduced by the interest due (i.e., three yuan). This is called ex-interest and should not be regarded as a change in the bond price. The method is currently being liquidated.</p>
<p>In reality, to eliminate the ridiculousness of the current freezing measures, there is only one path to take: telegraph the U.S. and British treasuries to immediately announce, "All import and export drafts to the U.S. and Britain that have not been approved for supply, regardless of their purpose or the issuing bank, shall not be cashed in the U.S. or transferred their creditor's rights within the territories of China, the U.S., and Britain. Any private transfer of creditor's rights will not only not be cashed in the U.S. or Britain, but we will also not recognize its legal effect." At the same time, announce, "In the future, all approved U.S. and British drafts should, in addition to the original signature, also bear the seal of the Sino-American-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. If there is no seal of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, it will be considered unapproved." If this method is implemented, then the drafts traded on the black market within the black market will all become waste paper. The black market within the black market will also disappear. And China's export drafts, even in the occupied areas where control is lacking, will not be afraid of not being sold to the market controlled by the Stabilization Fund. Therefore, the Stabilization Fund will also avoid repeating the mistake of only supplying without receiving. And the strengthening and effectiveness of the approval supply system will no longer be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e43">China's Agricultural Loans (Continued) – Recent Developments and Bright Future <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Hezhang</p>
<p>Of the 209,502,167 yuan in agricultural loans outstanding at the end of 1940, the Farmers Bank of China had issued 96,741,000 yuan, accounting for 46.18%; the Bank of China had issued 51,350,000 yuan, accounting for 24.51%; the Agricultural Credit Administration (before its reorganization in October 1940) had issued 37,855,382 yuan, accounting for 18.07%; the Bank of Communications had issued 12,579,785 yuan, accounting for 6%; and the Central Trust Bureau had issued 10,976,000 yuan, accounting for 5.24%.</p>
<p>The total amount of agricultural loans for this year (1941), according to the Joint Administration of the Four Banks, is expected to reach 400,000,000 yuan. Several large agricultural loans have already been contracted, such as 136,000,000 yuan for Sichuan Province and 30,000,000 yuan for Shaanxi Province.</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of loans in 1941, the allocation among the banks is as follows: the Farmers Bank of China is responsible for 45%; the Bank of China for 25%; and the Bank of Communications and the Central Trust Bureau for 15% each.</p>
<p>This type of agricultural loan can be categorized into agricultural production loans, agricultural supply and marketing loans, agricultural product storage and pledge loans, farmland irrigation loans, rural transportation equipment loans, tenant farmer land purchase loans, rural sideline occupation loans, and agricultural product promotion loans. The Joint Administration of the Four Banks is also handling agricultural loans according to the following guidelines: (1) promote the increase in agricultural production, land reclamation, and irrigation in the Great Rear Area, and promote handicrafts and small industries; (2) directly assist farmers' organizations and promote cooperative enterprises, establishing material-market cooperative finance; (3) strive for balanced loan distribution, simplify procedures, and adapt to agricultural seasons.</p>
<p>Future of Agricultural Commodities</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese government's active encouragement of agricultural loans can be proven by the increase in the aforementioned agricultural loan figures. The future progress of agricultural loans will undoubtedly advance along the government's established guidelines and improved pathways, which need not be elaborated upon. However, one point remains to be stated: since the establishment of new-style agricultural financial institutions in China, most have engaged in short-term loans, and few have engaged in medium-term loans. As for long-term loans, most avoid the important and take the light, looking away in disappointment. Examining the opinions of various experts, all believe that the path to China's agricultural development should focus on the government assisting tenant farmers in obtaining cultivated land and assisting small farmers in expanding cultivated land. Therefore, there is an absolute need to conduct long-term land loans.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the Farmers Bank of China established a Land Finance Department, with initial capital of 10 million yuan. According to the person in charge of the department, its business policy is based on Sun Yat-sen's instructions regarding land policy. Its loan types are divided into six categories: (1) land acquisition at assessed value loans; (2) land consolidation loans; (3) land improvement loans; (4) land replotting loans; (5) self-cultivating farmer assistance loans; (6) land registration consolidation loans. From the types of loans, it can be seen that the government is already conducting long-term land loans, but the department's current capital is only 10 million yuan. To conduct the aforementioned types of loans, a large amount of capital is needed, and the amount of 10 million yuan is certainly not sufficient. Moreover, long-term land loans have relatively sluggish capital and even lower interest rates, so long-term, low-interest capital is needed for turnover. Regarding this, the Land Finance Department can issue bonds with land as collateral to obtain capital.</p>
<p>Examining the sources of China's agricultural loan funds, most come from nationwide financial institutions, accounting for 74.65% of the total. Local banks and farmers' banks in various provinces account for 11.59% in total. As for commercial banks, due to the nature of their business, they are certainly not suitable for conducting agricultural loans. However, commercial banks that also conduct savings business must, according to the provisions of the Savings Bank Law, invest one-fifth of their total savings deposits in rural areas. It seems that the savings deposits of various banks have not yet been fully implemented in accordance with the provisions of the law. As of the end of 1939, there were 70 commercial savings banks in China, and together with other banks that concurrently handle savings, there were nearly 100. The amount of savings deposits absorbed must be substantial. Therefore, the government should strictly supervise commercial banks handling savings business and banks concurrently operating savings business, ensuring that their pledge loans to rural cooperatives and loans with agricultural products as collateral, and the purchase of bonds issued by the Land Finance Department or national agricultural financial institutions, shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. This will not only provide agricultural loan funds with a reliable and abundant source but also reduce the speculative business operations of general unsound banks.</p>
<p>If the aforementioned point can be implemented, then China's agricultural loan future will truly have infinite hope, and the development of agriculture will also be unlimited!</p>
<p>(Note) This figure is not the total for the entire year. The amount of loans recovered before the end of last year (1939) is not included in the statistics, nor are the agricultural loans that have been determined but not yet paid out this year (1940).</p>

<p>The bamboo joint steel bar market, which has been quiet for a long time, has been affected by the unpredictable changes in the financial market since yesterday. In addition, the construction trade on Wood Street has shown some activity. The market atmosphere has become active, and those holding goods feel that the prices are firm. The standard asking price has also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the 3-4 minute pattern was quoted at 3,350 yuan per ton, while the 5-minute to 1-inch goods were quoted at 3,300 yuan per ton, each rising by 50 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3 id="e45">New Wire Rod Trading Difficult to Smooth <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>New wire rod, also known as raw silk, is the main raw material for manufacturing native nails. In addition, screw factories, lead wire factories, and machinery factories also occasionally purchase it, but the number is not as large as that of native nail manufacturers. Recently, the native nail market has been fluctuating, and overseas transactions are difficult to continue. The number of daily transactions is also not large, so the trend of its raw material (wire rod) is also difficult to reach its peak. The standard price is still quoted at around 250-260 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Native Nails Hovering at 190 Yuan <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Native factory-made nails are still being produced by factories in this city due to the obstruction of overseas transactions. Although users on Wood Street are tirelessly purchasing, there are quite a few holders releasing goods, so the circulation of goods feels more and more congested, and it is difficult to see the standard price rising. The sentiment among the industry is flat, and the market does not seem to be very lively. Therefore, the standard market price is still hovering around 190 yuan, while the price of American wire nails must be around 200 yuan due to the interruption of overseas supply.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Black Steel Billets Showing Their Edge <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>2,000-pound black steel billets are being frantically searched for by thermos factories on Wood Street and are also affected by the soaring gold market. The market price is soaring, and the sentiment in the industry is extremely excited. The inventory of this product in Shanghai is not large, and the overseas supply has long been cut off. Those responding to the market are only relying on the spot goods on the market. Therefore, once the trend is good, it shows its edge. The standard selling price is rising rapidly. Yesterday, the market had already risen from 4,400 yuan to 4,600 yuan and is still continuing to rise. It is said that about 50-60 bundles were traded in the city yesterday, most of which were purchased by thermos factories and tin printing factories. It is expected that the market trend will be difficult to loosen in the future.</p>

<p>The New York cotton market is loose due to a lack of significant purchases and the liquidation of long positions, as well as short selling in the South. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by 2 to 9 points or so compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to sales by European exporters, then firmed slightly due to purchases by speculators, but ultimately weakened again due to the liquidation of long positions. As a result, the prices of various brands still rose by 1 rupee 25 to 4 rupees 50 or so compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the forecast opening price of Indian cotton today is slightly lower by 1 rupee 50 or so.</p>

<p>Cigarette prices are rising like lightning because the foreign exchange settlement for consumables is prohibited, resulting in an extreme shortage of raw materials. Factories have no scheduled shipments, and the demand in this city and for external sales is very strong. Spot goods on the market are very tight, and the market is advancing frantically. The price of the Great Britain brand has soared to 2,160 yuan per case, Old Knife brand to 1,820 yuan, Five Flowers brand to 1,210 yuan, Little Fairy brand to 1,410 yuan, Fine Sea brand to 1,470 yuan, and the medium case of 10-piece Big Beauty brand to 1,090 yuan, Pyramid brand to 1,020 yuan, all rising by 50 yuan to more than 100 yuan compared to the previous prices.</p>

<p>The soap market is rising because of a lack of raw materials and no shipments from factories for a long time. Sales on Wood Street are prosperous, and hoarders are also starting to store up, so the purchase price is soaring. Gu Ben soap has risen to 61 yuan per case, Bai Xiang Mao soap to 51 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap to 47 yuan and 50 cents, and Arrow Knife soap to 50 yuan, all rising sharply by more than 3 yuan compared to the previous prices.</p>
<p>The market price of matches is rising even more sharply, mostly because raw materials are gradually becoming scarce, and sales and domestic demand are extremely strong. Those holding goods are supporting prices, and few are selling, so the sentiment is gradually trending upward. The purchase price is soaring. The Beautiful brand has risen to 1,000 yuan per case, and the Phoenix brand to 980 yuan, rising by more than 100 yuan. The market is creating unprecedentedly high prices.</p>
<p>The candle market is brisk because sales orders are stepping up actively, and the buying sentiment is also strong, so the price is rising. The Ship brand is 37 yuan and 70 cents per case.</p>

<h3 id="e52">After Hall-Patch Arrives in Shanghai, Financial Conference Convened Yesterday, Making Important Decisions on the Management of Shanghai's Exchange Rates, Detailed Implementation Measures to Be Announced Soon <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Mr. E. L. Hall-Patch, American member of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and current British Far East Financial Advisor, arrived in Shanghai on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ship Yuesheng at 8:00 PM the night before last. Because the ship temporarily decided to anchor overnight at Woosung, it only entered the Huangpu River yesterday morning. Around 10:00 AM, the ship docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. After a while, Mr. Hall-Patch and his female secretary disembarked from the cabin and slowly walked down the ship, accompanied by those who greeted him, and went to the British Embassy at No. 27 The Bund to rest. He then gathered with the assistant Taylor and key personnel from Chinese and foreign banks at the embassy to discuss issues related to the Shanghai foreign exchange market. The meeting lasted for three hours. However, this was a preliminary review, and more thorough research and consideration will be conducted in the coming days to determine the exchange rate settlement plan.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last, Landed Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The news of Mr. Hall-Patch's arrival in Shanghai from Hong Kong was initially revealed to reporters by the Four Banks the morning before last. The Yuesheng, which he was on, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the night before last, but due to anchoring overnight at Woosung, it was delayed until around 10:00 AM yesterday morning before arriving at the Roosevelt Wharf. Dr. Taylor, the American assistant of the Stabilization Fund stationed in Shanghai, relevant responsible personnel from Chinese and foreign banks, and senior officials from the British Embassy all went to the wharf to greet him. Mr. Hall-Patch's cabin was No. 5 in the first-class cabin. He had one female secretary accompanying him. At 10:15 AM, Mr. Hall-Patch got off the ship with a smile, shook hands with those who greeted him one by one, exchanged brief greetings, and then took the British Embassy car to the British Embassy at No. 27 The Bund to rest. The responsible personnel from the relevant banks and Dr. Taylor all accompanied him.</p>
<p>Maintaining Shanghai's Legitimate Trade</p>
<p>Mr. Hall-Patch has long served as the British Far East Financial Advisor and is extremely familiar with China's economic situation. Since succeeding Sir Otto Niemeyer as the British member of the Stabilization Committee, he has contributed greatly to the decision-making of foreign exchange policies. This time, he was sent to Shanghai to supervise by the decision of the Stabilization Fund Committee's first meeting in Chongqing on August 16. On the one hand, it is to strengthen the connection between the Stabilization Committee and the Shanghai foreign exchange market, and on the other hand, to work with Dr. Taylor to study the most applicable exchange rate settlement method for Shanghai's special situation, in order to maintain legitimate import and export trade and complete the purpose of using the Stabilization Fund. In addition, Mr. Hall-Patch will conduct a specialized investigation into the currency situation in Shanghai and the surrounding occupied areas, in order to formulate a plan to consolidate the foundation of Chinese legal tender for the Stabilization Committee's reference.</p>
<p>Convening Meetings to Discuss Methods</p>
<p>However, the reason why Mr. Hall-Patch rushed to Shanghai within eight days was in response to the urging of Dr. Taylor, the American assistant stationed in Shanghai. The basic principles of exchange rate settlement agreed upon by Dr. Taylor and the relevant banks in Shanghai await Mr. Hall-Patch's participation and further planning. After resting briefly at the British Embassy at 10:30 AM yesterday, Mr. Hall-Patch invited Dr. Taylor and responsible personnel from HSBC, Citibank, Mercantile Bank, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to discuss the specific plan for exchange rate settlement for essential goods in Shanghai. In addition to each bank reporting on the current situation, they focused on discussing the settlement of essential goods and the termination of settlement for luxury goods based on the established principles. The meeting lasted for three hours and only adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Discussed Content, Revealed Generally</p>
<p>Although the content of yesterday's meeting was kept strictly confidential, according to disclosures from sources close to the banking sector, the meeting's main agenda included five items: 1. How to divide the essential goods that should be supplied with foreign exchange into several categories according to importance. In addition to the important parts being fully supplied, what percentage of the applied amount should be settled for decisive and re-decisive parts? 2. How to assess goods that are not prohibited from import but are of a luxury nature. Under what circumstances should a part be supplied, and under what circumstances should the right to refuse the entire supply be given? 3. In terms of review, how to determine that the trade is in good faith, and how to investigate whether the amount applied for settlement is necessary for legitimate needs? 4. In terms of application procedures, what kind of guarantee is the most reliable and what kind of standard is the most applicable? 5. How to strengthen the control of the China and Bank of Communications over the exchange rate settlement of Shanghai exporters?</p>
<p>Detailed Measures to Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The above agenda items were all discussed at yesterday's meeting, and a unified opinion was generally reached. As for the detailed implementation measures, they have been handed over to the Joint Office of the Four Banks to be drafted quickly based on the list of prohibited import goods announced by the Customs in July 1939, the list of goods allowed to be imported approved by the Executive Yuan in September 1940, and the resolutions of past meetings between Taylor and the banking sector. This measure will be officially announced in the short term. Because foreign banks have already supplied a portion of the foreign exchange needed for normal needs, but there is no definite method to follow, the announcement of the measure is indeed necessary as soon as possible. After this measure is announced, the Chinese and foreign banks designated by the general notice of the United States will all follow it uniformly.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Cooperating Fully</p>
<p>According to sources currently in the industry, when Dr. Taylor convened responsible persons from designated Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai to discuss the exchange rate settlement method, there was a fierce debate. The British banks believed that they should replenish from the Stabilization Fund Committee the foreign exchange that had already been settled for non-essential essential goods. The opposite view was that this would have a significant impact on the consumption of the Stabilization Fund and could not replenish the full amount of the settled amount. Finally, after sincere mutual understanding, it was decided that in the future, before supplying applied foreign exchange, the consent of the Stabilization Fund Committee must first be obtained. Otherwise, in order to prevent unlimited consumption of the fund, it cannot be replenished. Foreign banks expressed acceptance and cooperation in this regard, so the foreign exchange management system will become more strict.</p>

<p>According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the American President Lines will have a President ship arriving in Shanghai at the end of this month, carrying American nationals evacuated from this city, and returning to the United States via San Francisco. In the middle of next month, there will be another two President ships arriving in Shanghai, one of which is the President Harrison, a World-Class liner that left Shanghai on the 15th of this month and returned to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. Most of the first and second-class cabins of the Dutch Java Line's Tjisarua have already been booked, and it is said that most of them were booked by British and American personnel, because it is more convenient for them to take this ship to the Dutch East Indies, transfer to Australia, and return to their countries. Because the situation in the Far East has not yet reached its most serious stage, the number of Dutch nationals in this city who intend to evacuate and return to their country is very small.</p>
<p>Japanese Nationals Continue to Evacuate from the Philippines</p>
<p>It is reported that another 160 Japanese nationals will evacuate from Manila to Shanghai on the French shipping company's ship Kaiting on the 23rd of this month. Of the 371 Japanese women and children who arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship General Xiafei from Manila on the 23rd, 200 have decided to return to Japan on the Asama Maru, which will leave Shanghai for Kobe at 10:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Beautiful Writer Prevented from Leaving Japan</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, a group of 26 people, including officials from the American Consulate in Japan and officers from the Marine Corps, will arrive in Shanghai from Japan on the Tatsuta Maru on the 28th of this month. Among them, American travel writer Miss Green, who was also traveling with them, was suddenly refused a passport to leave Japan by the Japanese police authorities, so it is feared that she will not be able to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Miss Green has lived in Japan for two years and has written travel newsletters.</p>

<p>The counties of Northern Jiangsu, Jiangdu, Taixian, Gaoyou, and Xinghua, and the towns and villages under their jurisdiction, have suffered the most from the war. For example, Dinggou Tangtou in Jiangdu, Fanwen Xiaoji in Taixian, Yiergou Sanduo in Gaoyou, and Baiju Liuzhuang and nearby villages in Xinghua. Even the small houses of three or five families have all suffered terribly from the disaster. A total of 50 disaster areas, with a total of 38,000 households and 110,000 people, have not only had their houses and clothes burned to the ground after repeated looting, but also all the farming tools have been burned in the fire. Even the plowing cattle and rice seeds have been looted. Last winter, the government authorities, local charitable organizations, and fellow villagers in Shanghai and Chongqing have repeatedly tried to provide relief. Mr. Han Guojun, a respected elder from Northern Jiangsu, is extremely concerned. Recently, fellow villagers in Shanghai, including Bao Xiangzhong and Xin Zhixin, learned that the International Relief Council has some American wheat available for relief to war victims in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and has entrusted the Red Cross and Red Swastika Society to handle it. They asked to investigate, and if it was true, to provide a detailed account of the counties in Northern Jiangsu that were most severely affected and to request additional relief. It is reported that they have discussed this with Mr. Chen Zhenyan, Chairman of the Red Swastika Society in Chengdu, and Mr. Chen Mingfu, who is in charge of the Red Swastika Society in Qutang Town, Taixian, and have submitted a request for a report. It is now reported that the International Relief Council has agreed and approved the early release and that a transportation permit can be obtained.</p>

<p>Since the strike by printing industry typesetting workers on the 12th, the representatives of both sides have been actively mediating for days and have agreed on a solution. The union is advising those employers who have signed and complied to resume work first. For those who have not signed, the trade association must be responsible and make a final effort to urge them. However, the labor side claims that this procedure must be completed within three days.</p>

<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to levy a business tax, the Finance Committee met on the 18th to review it and decided to amend the original plan. The name will be changed to Business Property Tax Special Surcharge, and it will be levied in two levels: Level A for offices, shops, warehouses, docks, etc., with a property valuation of 3,000 yuan or more, the annual tax rate is 8%; Level B for exchanges, with a property valuation of 3,000 yuan or more, the tax rate is 15%. The proposal will be submitted to the Municipal Council meeting on the 3rd of next month for discussion.</p>
<p>The Council is Consulting with the Consular Body</p>
<p>In addition, Japanese sources have reported that, according to the decision of the special taxpayer meeting in April of this year, when any taxes other than those stipulated in the regulations on the land along the Yangjingbang Canal are levied, the opinion of the Advisory Committee should be sought. In order to make a final decision on this case as soon as possible, the Council is negotiating with the Consular Body, requesting that the Advisory Committee be formed as soon as possible. The consuls general of various countries are currently negotiating the selection of candidates.</p>

<p>A Publication from Over a Century Ago, Priced at Over 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Asse Woods, a broker from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, possesses a copy of "The Times" newspaper published in London over 130 years ago. It was auctioned off at the "Moonlight Drama Gathering" held at the Democratic Radio Station the night before last. Because the newspaper was published in 1805 and contains very detailed accounts of the Trafalgar War, it was auctioned publicly in the American style. The result was a bid of 103,150 yuan. Mr. Woods immediately donated the proceeds to the British War Relief Fund. In addition to this auction, another reprinted London "The Times," containing accounts of the Duke of Wellington's Battle of Waterloo, was also up for auction.</p>
<p>The final decision can be made, and the association will be formally established, with a membership of approximately 16 or 17 people, composed of representatives from various countries with authority. Once the association is established, the proposal to levy a special surcharge on business premises will be submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>Mid-September: A Decision Can Be Made</p>
<p>A general decision can be made around mid-September (as reported in yesterday's Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun"). However, when inquiring with a spokesperson of the Public Works Department about the reliability of the above news, it was stated that various committees of the Public Works Department had indeed discussed various plans to develop new sources of tax revenue, but the spokesperson was unwilling to disclose what resolutions had been reached in these discussions, as they had not yet been formally submitted to the Board of Directors. It was implied that various committees are currently studying several parallel plans, but which plan will ultimately be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval is not yet certain.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of the high tide in the Huangpu River in recent days, low-lying roads have been flooded. Areas near the Bund, such as Museum Road and Hong Kong Road, have also been inundated by tidal waters, turning them into watery lands, demonstrating the severity of Shanghai's flood problem, which deserves serious attention. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Public Works Department is actively carrying out flood control work. Currently, check valves have been installed in sewers at Henan Road and along the Bund to prevent backflow, and concrete flood barriers are being built along the Bund. At Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road and other locations, backflow prevention valves have been installed in sewers and workers have been assigned to manage them, and the situation is relatively good. Unless there is a high tide of more than eleven feet, or a combination of rainwater, it should not flood the roads.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Transit Visa Procedures for Burma and Hong Kong: Handwritten Signature Required on Passports for Burma; Two Important Points for Applying for Hong Kong Entry Permits <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>With Hainan Island occupied, Zhejiang and Fujian blockaded, and Vietnam forcibly garrisoned with troops, the routes from Shanghai to the mainland have been cut off. Fortunately, the Yunnan-Burma Road has reopened, and although the journey is long, there is still one route available. Therefore, the Shanghai-Rangoon air route has recently become a major transportation route. It is also understood that Guangzhou Bay is still accessible to the mainland, but the procedures for entry permits and visas for both places are relatively complicated. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Burma Visa: Validity Period Required</p>
<p>(1) Procedures for Burma visas: (A) The passport holder must sign their name in their own handwriting in the "Signature of Bearer" section on the seventh page of the passport; otherwise, they will be refused landing or detained. (B) When applying for a transit visa from the British Consulate, applicants should request the British Consul to specify the length of stay in Burma, such as one or two months. If the validity period is not specified, they must leave Burma within two weeks of arrival. Those who fail to leave within the specified period will be warned and fined two to three hundred rupees. If they still remain, once discovered, they will be subject to three months of detention. (C) According to the China Travel Service's Rangoon communication of July 25, "Travelers coming to Burma, whether for transit or entry, must deposit 200 kyats in Burmese currency as a deposit with the Home Department when applying for a visa. This cash deposit is refundable upon departure from Burma, but the application procedure is more troublesome." (2) The Guangzhou Bay route to the mainland is still open.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Entry Permits: Application Procedures</p>
<p>(3) Two Important Points for Hong Kong Entry Permits: A Hong Kong letter mentions two points to note regarding the procedures for applying for Hong Kong entry permits. They are copied below: (A) If the applicant has an address in Hong Kong, please fill it in detail. If the address in Hong Kong is forwarded by the China Travel Service on behalf of a transit traveler, a six-month entry permit cannot be obtained. Only a special term permit of one or three months will be issued. (B) Under the item "What is the purpose of your trip to Hong Kong," if it is stated that one is employed by a company or organization, it is quite difficult to obtain a permit, as the employer must personally go to the bureau to sign a guarantee before it can be obtained, which often delays the date. In the future, it is advisable to fill in the application form as "transit." Otherwise, the employee must first send a letter to the employer to contact the China Travel Service in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Two Labor Disputes Resolved Satisfactorily <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Noodle Industry</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the machine-made noodle industry has been resolved satisfactorily after fair mediation by various parties, and the following articles have been signed: (1) Wages below ten yuan will be increased by 80%, wages below fifteen yuan will be increased by 70%, and wages of fifteen yuan or more will be increased by 60%. (2) Workers who have worked for one full year will be paid double wages at the end of the year. If a worker has requested leave or been laid off, the worker is responsible for finding a replacement; otherwise, it will be considered absenteeism. (3) If a worker is sick, the employer will handle it as before and provide an appropriate subsidy. (4) Workers will be dismissed on a three-month probationary period. If the employer discovers any negligence in work during this period, the labor union will be notified five days in advance, and the wages will be calculated based on the number of days worked. (5) When the employer hires new workers, they will be introduced by the labor union after the labor union is established. If the labor union has no workers to introduce, the employer is free to hire. (6) Workers' meals will be treated the same as the employer's. (7) After the employer dismisses a worker, the wages of newly hired workers should be based on the wages of the dismissed worker as a standard, but if the work ability is not as good as the dismissed worker, the matter will be discussed with the labor union. (8) These articles will take effect on July 25.</p>
<p>Hengda Factory</p>
<p>The American-owned Hengda Machinery Factory at the intersection of Daxi Road and Dunxin Road was shut down on the 11th. After repeated negotiations, the workers have resolved the issue of dismissals with the employer, and all workers' severance pay will be in accordance with the American factory law (those who have worked for one month will be given five days' severance pay, those who have worked for one year will be given two months' severance pay, and so on). It has been agreed and approved that a mediation record will be signed today, and dismissal payments will be distributed to the workers.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Xin Puyu Hall Eagerly Awaits Continued Donations <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Still Short Over 50,000 Yuan This Year</p>
<p>Xin Puyu Hall in the Nanshi district, a well-known Catholic charitable organization, has been established for nearly thirty years. It is grand in scale and perfectly equipped, with a nursery, orphanage, nursing home, and disability home, accommodating thousands of orphans, the elderly, and the disabled. Under the leadership and education of the sisters of the Charity Society, they are no different from a paradise reborn for the poor, sick, orphaned, and suffering.</p>
<p>Before the war, the hall relied on the economic assistance of the Belgian Catholic Church and fixed donations raised from all parties by the hall directors, and its progress was extremely smooth. The relief work expanded year by year. After the war, external donations sharply decreased, and the Belgian Church, due to the fall of their homeland, was unable to take care of itself and stopped providing assistance. Due to these two major changes, coupled with soaring prices and a sharp increase in the need for supplies, it</p>
<p>Has fallen into difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>After on-site observation by this newspaper, it was felt that if such a complete orphanage and educational institution were allowed to close and be disbanded, it would be tantamount to sitting idly by and watching society suffer a great loss. Therefore, this newspaper has appealed to its readers on its behalf. Fortunately, it has been enthusiastically responded to by readers, and a total of more than 140,000 yuan in donations has been received from January to July. According to the</p>
<p>Budget prepared by the hall,</p>
<p>An annual expenditure of 192,000 yuan is required, and it is still short of over 50,000 yuan. It is eagerly hoped that all sectors of society will continue to make donations so that the education of hundreds of orphans will not be interrupted, and the elderly and disabled can enjoy their remaining years in peace. The titles of the donors before June have been published and thanked in the newspaper on May 12 and July 8, respectively.</p>
<p>Donations for July and this month will be publicly thanked in early September. Collection locations: (1) Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, 460 Hankou Road; (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (Overseas), Sassoon House, the Bund; (3) Jihua Hall Pharmacy, 47 Yunnan Road; (4) Huamei Pharmacy, 56 Fuzhou Road; (5) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street. Collection location for donated goods: Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Appeal to All Sectors to Save Disaster Relief Funds <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Frugality Movement Committee yesterday specially appealed to all sectors of society not to use useful surplus money for unnecessary extravagance during this national crisis. The general idea is that as the weather gradually becomes cooler, the number of disaster victims accommodated in the city increases. As commodity prices rise, supplies increase accordingly, and donations are limited, which will affect the supply of disaster victims. Beggars roaming the streets are also not a few, lacking both clothing and food, and their situation is particularly pitiful. Therefore, it is hoped that fellow citizens in the city will, with the righteousness of having already experienced hunger and drowning, save unnecessary expenses on ceremonies and donate to charity organizations to benefit disaster relief and stabilize social order.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Youthful Students Arrive at the Newspaper to Receive Aid: A Grand Occasion; Industry and Commerce Employees Begin Applying Yesterday <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Approved students from universities and middle schools received their educational aid at this newspaper yesterday morning. Employees in industry and commerce also started receiving application forms for aid for evening classes yesterday. Students and employees in industry and commerce, with joyful emotions, happily fulfilled their desire to learn, all thanks to the generous donations of the readers of this newspaper. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Surplus Aid: Voluntary Deduction</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, students from universities and middle schools who applied for aid came to the newspaper one after another to receive their educational aid according to the procedures. They were checked and distributed one by one. Among them, several students had originally applied to several schools. The amount of educational aid they originally applied for was higher than the tuition fees of the school they are currently enrolled in. They all stated at the time that they requested a reduction in the amount to be distributed to match the tuition fees of the school they are currently enrolled in. This kind of pure and sincere behavior is the inherent spirit of cultivating outstanding members of society. If the students can work even harder, their future achievements will be remarkable.</p>
<p>Approved Amount: Standard Set</p>
<p>Some applicants came in person or inquired in writing about the discrepancy between the approved educational aid and the amount of school tuition. The review standard is based on (1) economic situation and (2) academic performance. If the family is still able to manage and is not completely destitute, a portion of the aid will be provided, and this portion may not even cover the tuition fees. If the family is poor and there are two or more siblings applying at the same time, in addition to subsidizing tuition and miscellaneous fees for senior students in accordance with the regulations, junior students will be given a portion of the aid. There are also several extremely poor and hardworking university students whose tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the school are only thirty or forty yuan. This newspaper may specially provide aid beyond the regulations to be used for purchasing books, as the cost of books for each semester of university and college is very high. This method is also deeply appreciated by those who generously donate to benefit poor students. Several applicants will certainly be able to consider their own situation, or even be better off than others. There are many poor students, and it is deeply regrettable that we have not been able to benefit everyone. It is hoped that the students will apply early next semester to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>
<p>Late Applications: Difficult to Accommodate</p>
<p>Since this newspaper announced the approval of educational aid for all levels of elementary, middle, and high schools and began payments yesterday, the staff has already completed the work for this period and is now beginning to prepare for the educational aid specifically for employees in industry and commerce. However, we have continued to receive letters from poor students asking for special accommodation for applying for aid, and there are still quite a few. Yesterday, we also received a letter from Mr. Wang Jialin, stating, "Recently, because a small number of poor and studious students went to other places during the summer vacation to visit relatives or suffered serious illnesses, they were unable to complete the application procedures within the time limit stipulated by your newspaper, and therefore could not receive the educational aid from your newspaper and lost the opportunity to study. Such situations may still exist. However, this is a good opportunity that they themselves have given up, and there is no reason to forgive them. However, your newspaper's purpose is to help poor and outstanding children. I wonder if your newspaper can allow a special opportunity for applicants to provide a detailed reason. If it is considered forgivable, please approve it exceptionally. I wonder what your newspaper's opinion is?" Such a situation may be unavoidable. On the one hand, the staff deeply sympathizes with the plight of poor and studious youth, but on the other hand, they must abide by the decision and cannot change it on their own. Facts and reason are difficult to reconcile. Poor students urgently request aid, but we should not allow the staff to violate the law in any way. Therefore, we can only disappoint the hopes of poor students who applied late and hope that they will pay special attention when this newspaper holds the event on a scheduled date.</p>
<p>Shop Assistants and Apprentices: Enthusiastic Applications</p>
<p>Application forms for employees in industry and commerce were also issued for the first time yesterday, and more than 400 people came to the newspaper to receive them, which proves the large number of shop assistants and apprentices who have dropped out of school and their eagerness to study. Shop assistants and apprentices from various factories and stores sent letters yesterday expressing their deep admiration for the readers of this newspaper for their concern for shop assistants who have dropped out of school. For example, Mr. Wang wrote in his letter, "Your newspaper's announcement of providing aid to employees in industry and commerce to enroll in cram schools made me cry with joy. I am a trainee who has just completed my apprenticeship, and my income is very meager. The old clothes that I have worn for three or four years are still my friends, and my family often asks me for money. I really want to learn English, but I am unable to. Now your newspaper has educational aid for employees, which makes me see the light." Other letters also have the same feelings. What we want to comfort Mr. Wang is that although the clothes are old, it does not hinder his future. With sufficient knowledge, he can achieve something. Wearing old clothes and learning new skills, his future success is undoubtedly certain.</p>

<p>Mr. Teng Ruoqu, Gu, served as a counselor in the Executive Yuan for many years. He was knowledgeable and diligent in his work, and he was willing to enthusiastically promote cultural and artistic undertakings. His colleagues in the country all admired him. Unfortunately, he passed away in Chongqing in May of this year. When his relatives and friends in Shanghai suddenly heard the bad news, they were all shocked and grieved. Mr. Teng worked hard for the country during his lifetime and did not engage in family production. Therefore, his affairs after his death were extremely desolate. His elderly mother, widowed wife, and young children all need to be supported. Recently, many relatives and friends in Shanghai initiated the collection of funeral expenses, published advertisements in various newspapers, and widely solicited contributions. It is now heard that the donations for this funeral are quite enthusiastic, but the period for collecting funeral expenses is coming to an end. If there are any relatives and friends of Mr. Teng who have not yet donated funeral expenses, they can quickly send the funeral expenses to Mr. Cao at 528 Kang Nai Road within the next few days, as it may be too late. It is human nature to sympathize with the dead. To cherish and remember old friends is even more regrettable. I sincerely hope that Mr. Teng's relatives and friends in Shanghai will pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Two Shanghai Theaters, Hukuang and Jincheng, Were Struck by Smoke Bombs Yesterday; Explosions Occurred One After Another, Fortunately No One Was Injured; The Intention Seems to Be Intimidation <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, two major theaters in Shanghai, Hukuang and Jincheng, were struck by bomb explosions one after another. Fortunately, no one was injured in either location. The details learned are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hukuang</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, so Hukuang Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession added an early morning performance at 10:30 AM. At 11:30 AM, the theater suddenly received a strange phone call, informing the theater that there was a package in the men's restroom downstairs and to send someone to open it quickly, or it would explode. The theater immediately reported the situation to the French Concession police and sent workers to inspect the restroom. They found a package placed in one location. When the package on top was opened, it contained a bullet and a letter. At that time, the police had arrived and knew that there must be dangerous items in the other package, so they ordered it not to be touched. As expected, before the words were finished, an explosion occurred, with a loud bang and thick smoke billowing out. It was extinguished immediately. Because the explosive force was weak, no one was injured. However, at that time, it was the end of the show, and the audience was greatly alarmed. It is learned that the letter attached in the package roughly stated that the theater must send someone to Gaoqiao today (the 25th) to negotiate, and the person must carry a ham as a sign. The French Concession police have ordered a strict investigation of the case and the arrest of the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Jincheng</p>
<p>After the bomb incident in the French Concession, unexpectedly, around 12:00 noon, a bomb explosion also occurred in the Jincheng Theater on Beijing Road. The bomb was also a smoke bomb and was placed under a seat in the theater. Fortunately, the audience had already left the theater for a long time, so no one was injured. It is learned that the bomb was similar in size to the one at Hukuang. According to general speculation, the motive for placing the bomb must be the same as that of Hukuang.</p>

<p>Yongren Wang Linbao (19 years old), an apprentice at Sanyang South Goods Store on Nanjing Road, was in love with Wu Ayuan, a Nanjing woman who was a glass cup tea waitress in the movie department of the Wing On Company's rooftop garden. They lived together in a rented house at 185 McTaggart Road. Wang Linbao was successively deceived by the woman's mother, Wu Zhang, out of 3,600 yuan in betrothal gifts, and she also wanted 1,400 yuan for marriage expenses, causing Wang Linbao to resent her. Suspecting that she was intentionally extorting and wanting to marry his daughter to someone else, he took the opportunity to pour mercury into the oily bean curd vermicelli and gave it to her to swallow, intending to harm her life. After the case occurred, he was arrested and sent for trial. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend him. He was instructed to await sentencing. The presiding judge Jiang Xia visited the court the other day and sentenced Wang Linbao to five months in prison for harming someone's body. If he can commute the sentence to a fine, one yuan will be equivalent to one day.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Rong Wu Society Lectures: Responsibilities for Harmonizing Five Religions; Research on National Music After the Loss of the Classic of Music <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The 21st lecture of the Rong Wu Society was given by Mr. Shen Jueling on "Our Confucian Scholars Should Embody Confucius's Intention to Teach All People and Jointly Shoulder the Responsibility of Harmonizing the Five Religions," Section 2 of the "Liji Jingjie Pian," Six Classics, Han Shu, Yiwenzhi, Six Arts, and Analects, Classic of Filial Piety. Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "Research on National Music After the Loss of the Classic of Music." Mr. Shen began by saying,</p>
<p>Harmonizing the Five Classics</p>
<p>The Liji Jingjie Pian says, "Confucius said, by entering a country, you can know its teachings. If its people are gentle and sincere, it is the teaching of poetry. If they are insightful and know how to avoid harm, it is the teaching of history. If they are broad-minded and easy to get along with, it is the teaching of music. If they are clean, quiet, and subtle, it is the teaching of the Book of Changes. If they are respectful, frugal, solemn, and reverent, it is the teaching of rites. If they are skilled in rhetoric and compare events, it is the teaching of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Therefore, the loss of poetry is ignorance, the loss of history is deceit, the loss of music is extravagance, the loss of the Book of Changes is treachery, the loss of rites is annoyance, and the loss of the Spring and Autumn Annals is chaos. If its people are gentle and sincere but not ignorant, then they are deeply versed in poetry. If they are insightful and know how to avoid harm but not deceitful, then they are deeply versed in history. If they are broad-minded and easy to get along with but not extravagant, then they are deeply versed in music. If they are clean, quiet, and subtle but not treacherous, then they are deeply versed in the Book of Changes. If they are respectful, frugal, solemn, and reverent but not annoying, then they are deeply versed in rites. If they are skilled in rhetoric and compare events but not chaotic, then they are deeply versed in the Spring and Autumn Annals." The Six Classics were all edited by Confucius himself, so his teachings could be known by entering a country. Those who receive the teachings of the Six Classics sometimes inevitably have the disadvantage of losing balance, but Confucius still harmonized them with balance, which is why he is a sage. The Han Shu Yiwenzhi regarded the Six Classics as the Six Arts and prefaced the Six Arts by saying, "The texts of the Six Arts, music to harmonize the spirit, the expression of benevolence. Poetry to correct speech, the use of righteousness. Rites to make clear the good, the clear are obvious, so there is no training. History to broaden hearing, the art of knowledge. Spring and Autumn to judge events, the symbol of trust. The five are the way of the Five Constants, they need each other to be complete, and the Book of Changes is the origin." The Book of Changes uses Yin and Yang lines to be in the correct position to be upright, and when they are in the correct position, Yin lines are in the second place and Yang lines are in the fifth place to be balanced.</p>
<p>The Way of Balance and Harmony</p>
<p>The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Balance is the great foundation of the world, and harmony is the path to all people." The great Confucian scholar Zheng Kangcheng of the Han Dynasty said, "The Doctrine of the Mean is to clarify the use of balance and harmony. The meaning of harmony is great!" The Yiwenzhi preface to the Analects says, "The Analects is the dialogue of Confucius with his disciples and contemporaries, and the words heard by the disciples from each other and received from the Master. The disciples recorded them at all times. After the Master died, the disciples edited and abridged them together, so it is called the Analects." The preface to the Classic of Filial Piety says, "The Classic of Filial Piety is Confucius's statement of the way of filial piety to Zengzi. Filial piety is the warp of heaven, the righteousness of earth, and the conduct of the people. It speaks of the greatest things, so it is called the Classic of Filial Piety." The thirteen classics that are called today, the Han Zhi included the Analects in the Xiaoxue Jia (Elementary Learning) and the Erya in the Classic of Filial Piety Jia (School of the Classic of Filial Piety). It is clear that these three classics should all be recited and learned in childhood, and the Arts are the learning of higher education. Mr. Shen was old and recovering from illness, so he could not speak much, so Mr. Yang took over and said:</p>
<p>Chinese Musical Arts</p>
<p>Chinese musical arts developed the earliest. Yi Qi had earth drums and reed flutes, Ge Tian had the Xuan Bird dance music, Zhu Xiang had the five-stringed se, Mi Xi had the nine-stringed qin, the fifty-stringed se had Nuwa's sheng and reed pipes, and Shennong had the five-stringed qin bells and chimes. The details are described in the Liji Lvlan Shiben. When Huang ordered Linglun to create the twelve temperament pipes, he changed the silk strings to mulberry, and the eight tones were complete. The music has temperament, so it can "establish balance," "produce standards," and "prepare numbers." As for the few, there are five temperaments in Greece, the same as Babylon and Hebrew. Later, there were seven temperaments, the same as Egypt, and twelve temperaments, the same as China. There were fourteen temperaments in Siam, seventeen temperaments in Anxi Dash, twenty-two temperaments in Juan Du, nineteen temperaments by Italians in the Ming Dynasty, fifty-two temperaments by Belgians in the early Qing Dynasty, and forty-one temperaments by Hungarians in the late Qing Dynasty. The most were Jingfang's sixty temperaments and Qian's three hundred and sixty temperaments. Zheng Zhu of the Ming Dynasty created the twelve equal temperaments. More than a hundred years later, the Germans began to know how to advocate its use, and it has been popular to this day. Recently, there has been a proposal to adopt the twenty-four temperaments of Western Asia, which is the "Little One Temperament" of the History of Music in the Book of Wei (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Experiment of Clothing <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Narrated by Zhuge Liang</p>
<p>According to those who have deep experience in society: "A person must have at least two different masks to stand in society—the special society now."</p>
<p>But how can one have two different masks? Although there are many different masks in toy stores, how can you wear them to see people? After thinking for two days, I had a flash of inspiration, and I prepared two sets of clothes: a Parisian suit and a blue cloth long gown.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I had nothing to do after graduation and was idle at home all day, which was simply suffocating. On the other hand, I wanted to test society before entering it, so as not to suffer losses in the future.</p>
<p>At first, I took turns wearing the two pieces of clothing, looking in the mirror in the closet. The first decision revealed nothing; the second decision was still not enough; so I watched it three times. Ah! I feel that I am a person in a suit, but when I put myself in Chinese clothing, am I not a person? In other words, I am me in a suit; but in Chinese clothing, I am still myself. What's the difference?</p>
<p>Oh, some people say that I look like a young man in a suit. Ha! Would I become a white-bearded old man if I wore a blue cloth gown? Ah, God is my witness!</p>
<p>There is also one thing that I shouldn't mention, lest I hurt a friend's friendship. But that person is very open-minded, and probably "a gentleman does not remember the faults of villains."</p>
<p>One day, that friend said: "The way you walk is very graceful, lively and innocent, somewhat like Hollywood's Tyrone Power." In his bright eyes, I saw that this was not sarcasm.</p>
<p>Although I am not very familiar with Tyrone Power, I have met him on the screen once or twice; as for resembling him, I have never even dreamed of it. I remember the "Strategies of the Warring States" saying that Zou Ji did not think that Xu Gong of the north of the city was beautiful, but Ji still had a beautiful appearance. After I looked in the mirror myself, ah, You Choufu was ridiculous, I accepted that comment, which made me sweat with shame, and I wished I could find a hole to hide in.</p>
<p>However, one day, that friend said again: "You often deliberately put on airs when walking, which is really artificial."</p>
<p>How strange! He praised me at first, but then criticized me. I don't know what the mystery is. After studying for four days, I always felt that my walking was the same at all times. Perhaps my detective skills were still a little clever, and I finally found the truth on the fifth day. It turned out that I was wearing a suit when we met the first time, and a blue cloth gown the second time.</p>
<p>But another question was swirling in my mind: Why does a suit make my movements graceful, but a long gown make people feel disgusted?</p>
<p>I lost sleep for two nights for that question. No, it can be said that it was three nights, because at 11:57 on the third night, I got the answer. The answer made me jump out of bed and I was excited all night.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple. You think, has Tyrone Power ever worn a blue cloth gown? Yes, that's the answer.</p>
<p>Wearing a blue cloth gown and looking around in a certain company aroused the attention of an inspector, who bothered him to "protect" me tightly. When I stood in front of a certain department, he stood nearby, staring at me with torch-like eyes. The more I didn't buy anything, the more suspicious he became. Thank you for his kindness, he took me all the way to the door.</p>
<p>Not reconciled, I changed into Western clothes a week later. Although I didn't encounter that inspector, the female staff's stern face was much kinder. Perhaps it was my attitude of looking around that attracted her attention. She asked me a question. At first, I thought her question might have the same effect as the inspector's gaze; ah! I was wrong.</p>
<p>"Do you need to buy something?" she asked.</p>
<p>I silently returned home, picked up a magnifying glass, and searched the blue cloth gown. There was no "thief" character on it. Perhaps my magnifying glass is not as good as the inspector's eyeballs? Yes, there are many people in the world whose pupils can far surpass a microscope, because they can clearly observe wealth and poverty in clothes. If you use a microscope, hum, don't even think about it!</p>
<h3 id="e79">A Painting in the Study <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Master Zilan</p>
<p>In the past, Duke Jin lived in Jinling and brought Yuan An's snow painting to hang in his pavilion, and he felt that the summer heat was cool and the fatigue of official documents was relieved. Therefore, all comfort for people really belongs to the soul. Recently, Mr. Wells predicted world events as clearly as watching fire, but his conclusion is that when everything will not exist in the future, painters will definitely not be reduced. It can be seen what a great job it is!</p>
<p>Let's say that people like us who work at desks all day long, when we are tired, we look up and see a good painting on the wall. It has great lines and beautiful displays; let's say it is a Chinese painting, it contains a full ancient atmosphere, which makes people immediately energetic. I have always had a good hobby for traditional Chinese paintings, and I especially like the two old friends Wu Hufan and Chen Dieye. Hufan's spring exhibition of teachers and students allowed me to appreciate the great art; now Dieye also has a personal painting show at the Daxin Art Hall, which will last from today until the end of August. He has a full year of painting time, but only more than one hundred and twenty pieces are produced; he himself thinks it is already too much, and in the future, he will always advocate a personal exhibition with only a dozen or twenty pieces, and the preparation time is preferably two years. On this point, we can believe that his paintings can be carefully crafted and full of his own soul, giving us comfort.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The era of watermelons and cantaloupes has passed, and cucumbers have long been old. Among the melon family, only loofah and winter melon are still active in the vegetable market. Loofah doesn't feel old at all, and the price is still a bit expensive, two or three can be bought for a dime, and buying things for two or four cents, adding some auxiliary products, can also deal with two meals a day. Last time I said that loofah can only be used for vegetarian dishes, and there is no place for it in meat dishes. However, the editor forwarded a letter from reader Mr. Du Lubing, saying that loofah can be fried with eggs and made into egg soup. The method is very simple, just peel the loofah, cut it into small pieces, mix it with eggs, and then stir-fry it in a pot. When making soup, in addition to loofah and egg flowers, you can add dried shrimp or scallops, which also taste very delicious. The author has tried these two methods separately and they are indeed good. Readers may also want to try them.</p>

<h3 id="e83">How to Use a Thermos? <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Changcheng Ganmin</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a thermos is used to store hot water. Everyone knows how to use it: pour hot water into the bottle and put the cork on. There are no other mysteries. But for how to prolong its life? How to maintain its effectiveness? And how to use it in a hygienic way? Many people neglect these points; often, due to improper use, not only does it cost more money, but it also brings unnecessary troubles, which is really frustrating. Now I will write down the most common and easily made mistakes in using a thermos, hoping that mothers will pay attention to them. It can also be regarded as a kind of common sense in the family.</p>
<p>1. Before pouring boiling water, you must first warm it with warm water to avoid the bottle liner from suddenly exploding due to heat.</p>
<p>2. After flushing the water, you must wipe dry the water stains on all parts of the bottle shell, otherwise the dripping at the bottom will gradually rot, and after a long time, there will be a risk of the bottom falling off, and it will endanger the bottle liner.</p>
<p>3. Before adding water, you must pour out the water stored in the bottle and wash it, so as to avoid impurities in the water (commonly known as water feet) from attaching to the bottle. After a long time, the glass will definitely become sandy. After that, the poured water must also be contaminated, and if you accidentally drink it, it will hinder your health.</p>
<p>4. If the cork rots after a long time of use and is not replaced, drinking the broken wood chips with the water will also hinder hygiene. (Thanks for your payment)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Economic Drinks <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Jingxuan</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Hunger thinks of food, thirst thinks of drink." Food and drink are both necessities of life. The gap between rich and poor is huge at sea, and what people drink varies. In dance halls and restaurants, a glass of orange juice and a cup of ice cream cost two or three yuan, which is the drink of the rich. On street corners, a glass of fruit dew costs two cents, and a glass of sour plum soup costs one cent, which is the drink of the poor. The former is very expensive, and the latter is unhygienic. Therefore, I have recorded several kinds of ordinary drinks, which are both economical and hygienic. No matter where you are, they are very easy to obtain. Readers can try them.</p>
<p>(1) Honeysuckle Soup: Use a pinch of honeysuckle and chrysanthemum, add one or two fresh and old fragrant leaves, and one or two pieces of licorice (not too much, too much will be too sweet). Brew with boiling water and drink it cold. It is sweet and refreshing, and it can relieve heat and fire. Drinking it for a long time can prevent sores and boils.</p>
<p>(2) Barley Tea: Roast barley until it is dry, one property, brew it with boiling water, it has the aroma of coffee, and none of the bitterness of tea. Drinking it often in summer has more advantages than disadvantages.</p>
<p>(3) Homemade Coffee Tea: Take one liter of shelled and peeled peanuts, stir-fry them dry in a wok until nine-tenths of each grain is scorched, take them out, mash them with a mortar, and when drinking, take a spoonful of white sugar and a spoonful of homemade coffee, and brew them with boiling water. The taste is no less than that of Brazilian goods.</p>
<p>(4) Homemade Cocoa Tea: Take one liter of shelled barley, stir-fry it dry in a wok, put it into a grinder and grind it into a fine powder after it is scorched, and when drinking, add a spoonful of white sugar and brew it with boiling water. The taste is not much different from cocoa.</p>
<p>Brief News Since the publication of the Pocket Book of Hawthorne Detective Cases by Cheng Xiaqing, published by the World Book Company, it has been widely sold. Now, three more types have been released: (8) The White-Clothed Monster, (9) The Death Charm, and (10) The Contradiction Circle. The seventh type, "The Homecoming of the Dance Queen," was previously published in this newspaper and has now been made into a movie, renamed "Sound Inspection on a Rainy Night," which will be released soon.</p>

<h3 id="e85">How Do Shop Assistants and Apprentices Improve Themselves? <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Generally speaking, shop assistants and apprentices are not lacking in well-educated people, but some also have the pain of not having enough knowledge to apply. They may doubt a certain *cheng* in the production machinery, the social relations of commodities, or even the reason why accounting subjects are so... Their basic business is not incompetent because of proficiency; however, perhaps when they come into contact with the depth of work, efficiency is ultimately not very pleasant and well-considered due to certain limitations. Some shop assistants and apprentices received only very limited school education at the beginning of their employment, although their service experience has exceeded a special class of half-bottle soy sauce and a can of vinegar freshly graduated students.</p>
<p>Since the business of modern society is so complicated, everything is becoming rationalized and scientific, and entrepreneurs are striving to strengthen their careers and seek a way out, then how can most employees not adapt to the trend and be good at coping with new changes in various jobs? The way of learning is to seek progress. Tang Zhi's plate inscription says: "If you are new every day, and new again every day, and new every day, it is not easy to be an outdated luxury in an era.</p>
<p>Every time I see a kind of person, holding the view of being a monk for a day and hitting the clock for a day, whether it is the abbot, the host, the receptionist, or the incense burner, they strive for perfunctory and perfunctory, and the work is done haphazardly, let alone how to chant sutras, and whether the clock strikes new or old. Since the service is too rigid and monotonous, then their life naturally has a feeling of "living like a year". This kind of psychology accumulates over time and develops the habit of "complaining about everything", but don't you hear people say? A line of work produces top scholars. My job is to make the products excellent, increase sales, improve customer service, and make the accounting system strict. These must be carefully studied, and progress must be sought every day in order to stand out and win the final victory.</p>
<p>Modern enlightened entrepreneurs are not short-sighted, (many institutions pay for trainees to study in depth to adapt to the business, which is one example) they work hard and have made great achievements. In their spare time, they do not forget to improve their studies; they hope to create a bright road for the country and private enterprises!</p>
<p>A group organization that cultivates a "love of learning" has a great help to the overall business, and it is not impossible to develop better habits in personal private life. Every time I see a few employees who are bored after work, some sing and play the piano, and even more are constantly dancing in the pavilions, eating tofu, and their lives lose their normal order, and their budgets lose their balance. The reason for this lies in leisure, and the way to save it is to improve. The ancients said that we should cultivate our noble spirit, and the so-called spirit is indeed derived from cultivation. From this, we can be unshakable, undaunted, kind, and sharp. The objective environment really depends on the subjective transformation. I dare not make idealistic sermons here.</p>
<p>Let's look at the successful entrepreneurs and employees at home and abroad. Which one did not come from hard study? A chemistry encyclopedia, a new accounting, part-time tutoring, reading until midnight, holding your breath to knock on the door, climbing on the counter, sleeping under the quilt, and getting up the next morning to manage things, you feel refreshed. "Using the Yingshuo's axe to attack the good material of Qizi," a group of bosses and owners with brains treat shop assistants and apprentices just like the arms and wrists, and receive their effects. Therefore, they trust each other up and down and run in parallel without conflict.</p>
<p>Naturally, in this extraordinary period, the cost of living is so high, and most employees want to improve their studies, but they are limited by the environment. Fortunately, social figures with this enthusiasm have repeatedly urged, and all walks of life have responded sincerely. The Shen Bao's promotion of the shop assistant reading movement does not worry about not having any results. It can be shown as fulfilling its small role for the society.</p>
<h3 id="e86">It's Difficult to Hire an Ayi <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Yu'er</p>
<p>The Li family's ayi went back to the countryside, so Mrs. Li had to twist her small feet to personally call an ayi at the intermediary shop - a tall Shandong woman. She was as strong as an ox and did all kinds of heavy work; Mrs. Li was of course very satisfied, but there was one thing that made her very regretful, that is, she had to eat three big bowls of rice every meal, so Mrs. Li made up her mind to rather spend a few more yuan on wages and ask her to eat less rice. She discussed it with her:</p>
<p>"Hey, ayi, you do a very good job, but you eat too much rice, so I will give you three yuan for rice in addition to the five yuan in wages, that is to say, you have to eat two big bowls of rice less every meal."</p>
<p>"I won't do that. I came out to be an ayi to eat my fill." Saying that, she picked up her package and left. Mrs. Li stared blankly at her back disappearing outside the door.</p>
<p>From then on, Mrs. Li learned a lesson, that is, a big-bodied ayi eats too much; so the next day she went to the intermediary shop to call a small-bodied ayi. She felt very satisfied, at least she ate less rice. Unexpectedly, this ayi came with a "voluntary resignation", saying that there were too many people and the work was too busy to handle.</p>
<p>There are many people in the Li family, and the weather is hot. Mrs. Li can't do so much housework, so she feels very annoyed. After dinner, Mrs. Li moved a stool to the lane to enjoy the breeze, and talked to the neighbors about hiring an ayi. The ayi next door was very "enthusiastic" and was willing to introduce someone to her, and guaranteed that she would be satisfied.</p>
<p>The next morning, the ayi next door really brought a young and strong person. Mrs. Li left her behind. She paid attention to her work, and really, she found her 100% satisfied; not only did she work quickly, but she also ate very little. Mrs. Li couldn't help but laugh in her heart when she was satisfied. The third day was the day to "weigh the wages". This is the old rule. Mrs. Li was prepared to talk to her about the "wage issue", but to her surprise, the ayi opened her mouth first and said:</p>
<p>"There are always mahjong games, and guests are always invited... The wages should be twelve yuan, and the extra money should be at least five yuan. If not, then I won't do it."</p>
<p>"The extra money is based on "the forehead", the wages are only..." Before she could finish speaking, the ayi patted her butt and left.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li was stunned for a long time.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>12. Unexpected Troubles</p>
<p>The so-called "she," of course, is Mei Bao.</p>
<p>So, did Mei Bao ultimately escape Shang Lao Er's clutches? This requires the facts that occurred half a month later to prove it.</p>
<p>This day was the day before the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar. Hengshui County Middle School had only been open for three or four days, and classes had not officially started yet. Mei Bao was already being escorted into the city by Zhang Xiaogouzi.</p>
<p>On the morning of the day she left Zhangshu Village, Autumn Begonia specially locked the door and saw his daughter off to the market entrance west of the village.</p>
<p>"With your natural talent, you can definitely make a living as an opera singer." As they were about to part, he handed the small leather suitcase he was carrying to Mei Bao and said to her in a very solemn tone, "But you must know that I have already fallen into a big pit in this field. Unless it is absolutely necessary, I really don't want you to step into this very dangerous circle..."</p>
<p>Mei Bao lowered her head, fiddling with a short braid on her left side, listening quietly.</p>
<p>"Now I don't expect anything else, I just hope you study hard. Once this half year is over and you have a junior high school diploma, you can find a job in any elementary school. Even if it's a bit tough, we'll be much more at peace!" Autumn Begonia placed both hands on Mei Bao's shoulders and continued, word by word, "Child, listen to me, you must study hard in school, and don't take to heart the few operas I taught you. What Uncle Zhao said has always been a bit crazy, so don't take it seriously. Anyway, you'll have more free time when you become a teacher in the future, and I can slowly teach you then, it'll be in time..." (193)</p>

<p>Dancer A: Spending ten dollars today was worth it after all. That girl looks only eighteen years old, but somehow, her dance steps are very experienced.</p>
<p>Dancer B: What's so strange about that? The one I met the other day was much prettier, but small dance halls, walking in and out, are detrimental to one's dignity.</p>
<p>Dancer A: It's getting late, let's go to a restaurant for a bite to eat!</p>
<p>Dancer B: Brother! Save it! Not much money left. I still have to go for a decisive battle tomorrow night.</p>
