<p>社評</p>
<h3>「春季攻勢」的前夕</h3>
<p>這幾天的世界大局，在新聞報道中，以乎已不是緊張嚴重等抽象字眼所能形容於萬一·不論英倫海峽，巴爾幹·直布羅陀或南太平洋，都有局勢一步逼緊一步之感。人人心頭壓着許多疑問：喧騰已久的「春季攻勢」究竟是否即將爆發？爆發之方向如何？東西同時發作，抑或分別先後？如果德國先動，實行渡海攻英，還是先下巴爾幹或先奪直布羅陀？如果日本先動，逕取荷印，還是先犯緬甸？凡此種種，已成今日舉世所急欲解答的問題。</p>
<p>現階段的德義日三同盟國，確有同病相憐之概；一方苦於交戰對方的日益强固，甚恐前途夜長夢多；一方則懾於美國態度的愈趨積極，深知日久必成大患；而義國作戰的每况愈下，大有難乎爲繼之觀。，因此不得不互相加緊勾結，期在軍備租借法案成立與實施之前，僥倖行險，以打破當前的危局。此種挺而走險。孤注一擲的心理·原已盡人皆知，不過，二國在實行冒險之前，却不能不稹密準備其行動，並充分估計其後果，務求攻勢一旦發動，其危險性愈小愈佳，成功性却愈大愈妙。惟其三方面都充滿患得患失之心，遂使彼此之間暴露了爾詐我虞之象：德國以促成日蘇接近爲餌，竭力慫恿日本首先南進，以便利她自己的對英攻勢，同時日本也正切望德國首先攻英或向其他方面擴大戰事，以便牽掣英美，聽任日本完成趁火打刦式的南進政策。準此而論，德義日三國雖極盡其三位一體的外貌，實際上仍各有其取巧規避的私心；布這種情形之下，欲斷言東西兩組戰局中的侵略者，今後究竟何方首先一發難，」確是一個難題。最可能的答案，是雙方同時發動，俾聲勢上即可格外壯闊一點，在實際效果上似乎也更能牽掣美國的實力。抑不問是否同時發動，其間的日本終是處於配角地位，蓋其實力早經消耗過半，他日即使欲在南洋進行所謂閃電戰，其成功的把握。也必定較德國在歐洲方面所得有爲者爲少；又况在中英美三國乃至荷印澳洲同仇敵愾，嚴陣以待的現行情勢之下·日本僥倖得逞的機會，尤其渺茫之至。</p>
<p>至於歐洲方面·希特勒所計割的未來攻勢·當不難想像是一個多方面的攻勢，其最爲世人所熟道的，不外下述數種行動：（一）利用優勢空軍，掩護陸軍部隊，直接攻襲英倫三島：這固然是打擊英國神經中樞的理想戰略，但其失敗性最大，所需要的代價也最多，萬一登陸計劃不能奏功，不僅物質損失綦重，在精神上所能產生的後果尤其可怕：因此，除非德國能在地中海方面另有作爲，迫使英國自其本部抽調過量的艦隊與空軍，以致影響英倫三島的固有防務，而予德軍以可乘之機，恐怕希特勒還未必願輕易嘗試此項登陸計劃。（二）實行假道保加利亞或南斯拉夫，以直撲薩洛尼加：觀於近日德軍入保傳說之甚囂塵上，以及南國總理的遄赴德國，希特勒向巴爾幹擴大戰爭，確是十分可能的；不過，在進軍希臘之前，也還有若干値得考慮的地方，質言之，蘇聯的意向，土耳其的參戰，和英國利用近東根據地發動大規模反攻的可能性，似乎都需要慎重加以顧及；而南斯拉夫保加利亞兩國民意的向背，似乎也還在未定之天。（三）壓迫法國維希政府和西班牙的弗朗哥，使其參加軸心，聽任德軍假道攻略直布羅陀，以牽掣英國地中海艦隊，從而切斷不列顚帝國的生命綫，這是半年前的老問題，觀於法義西三國巨頭連日的會晤，希特勒似乎仍未忘情於此；但很顯明地，這步棋甚難如願；因爲貝當上將以海外殖民地和其殘餘艦隊作護符，‘對於德國的苛求，始終還沒有屈服的跡象可尋；而經過數年內戰的西班牙，在軸心威勢日落，而糧食猶依賴英美方面竭力接濟的今日，似乎更沒有自投羅綱的理由；又况西國萬一參戰，前此被國民軍戰敗的共和軍難保不死灰復燃，乘機復仇，使剛剛安定的西班牙民族，又要遭難。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，希特勒的未來攻勢也未嘗不是荆棘滿途，今後除非能夠把各種外交上政治上的阻力，完全打通，然後在比較順適的條件下，發動多方面的攻勢，以冀英國的無法兼顧，或冀以猝不及防；否則，他所處心積慮準備的一春季攻勢」，仍不免隨春風而俱逝吧！</p>

<p>歐戰業談（卅）（五）</p>
<h3>巴爾幹半島的疑陣</h3>
<p>這篇是紐約泰晤士報駐歐訪員的無綫電報吿，茲節譯如下：</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島正籠罩着一種烟幕，這烟幕尙非戰爭的烟火，而是德國故意宣傳造成的，換句話說，仍是德國宣傳部長郭培爾的拿手傑作。</p>
<p>起先，德國駐土耳其大使巴本會向駐在國政府保證，謂德國對於巴爾幹並無他意。南斯拉夫和瑞士兩國京城的德國秘密工作人員則散佈德軍向羅馬尼亞集中的謠言，間時，羅馬尼亞和匈牙利兩國京城方面也散佈德軍向匈牙利集中的一套杯弓蛇影之談。這種謠諑傳遍各地之後，德國駐匈羅兩國使館人員就分頭闢謠，矢口否認這種讕言。</p>
<p>德國在巴爾幹半島內外，週而復始地旋展這種宜傳策略，弄得人心惶惶，雞犬不寗，德軍便得借此造謠闢謠的烟幕，調動自如，暗中對蘇聯，對保加利亞，對希臘或對其他惴惴不安的國家，準備進行嶄新的攻勢。雖然這些　傳亦不過虛張聲勢而已。</p>
<p>歸納言之，巴爾幹方面現有兩大的因素；第一，實際上的停頓；第二，德國武裝齊全的十兵一百五十萬人正閑着無事。</p>
<p>據蘇聯方面的情報，德國在蘇聯邊境附近，自東普魯士起迄黑　止，雲集人軍約八十師。蘇聯亦備有足額部隊嚴陣以待，此外，德國在新佔領或併呑各地駐紮軍隊的六十師，以供鎭壓之用，但另有配備齊全的軍隊六十師尙未調動，其行動如何，則極爲蘇聯所注意</p>
<p>莫斯科方面所以如此担心者，實因德國聞已有冬季配備的軍隊六七師開入羅馬尼亞北部，另有十師至十二預定在二月十五日以前開到，還有五師左右，也已開到多瑙河一綫</p>
<p>不過這些都屬揣測之辭，未可盡信，其中至少有一部份是德國的烟幕作用。惟有一事是千眞萬確的，即德軍尙未開入保加利亞，而土耳其軍隊，數月以來，無時不劍及履及，以備不測。</p>
<p>一般人雖信德軍的集中，確有其事，甚或立即有所行動，亦屬可能。但土耳共仍能鎮靜自處，不爲所動，深信德國的巴爾幹政策，威脅的成份多於行動。土耳其並信，一朝捲入旋渦，蘇聯方面定能以煤油和糧食深深接濟，一如接濟　臘一樣。</p>
<p>土耳其對於英國的盟約，始終信守不渝，去年六月法國戰敗，英國危急萬分的時候，也沒有改變態度。希臘也知土耳其可靠，深信土耳其和保加利亞可以保衛右翼的安全，故巳將保加利亞邊境附近駐防的軍隊撤退一大部份，增援前綫了。</p>
<p>另據倫敦方面的觀察，德國當前問題，似在發動春季攻勢，以援助義大利對希臘作戰。其進攻巴爾幹的途徑不外兩路。一路自南斯拉夫穿越畢多奇口，直指希臘薩拉尼加；但希臘軍業已佔領阿爾巴尼亞之柯里柴，力足以控制畢多奇口，又况德國由這一路進兵，首先須與南斯拉夫發生衝突。另一路取道羅馬尼亞和保加利亞以撼希臘之側，此路雖利於坦克車戰術，但須準備直接與保加利亞間接與土耳其開釁，而蘇聯見德軍深入，能否再事袖手旁觀，實屬疑問。</p>
<p>土耳其一旦有事，同盟的英國也必以海軍及一部份空軍予以援助，並儘量以金錢和物質接濟。</p>

<p>東布昨市狂瀉、細布每疋猛跌四元、現貨龍頭晨開四十四元半、直瀉至四十一元一角收盤、（取引所）期貨本月份亦跌至四十二元〇一分、蓋以客銷阻滯、業內外心虛膽怯、一致拋售、遂成疲莫能興之狀、</p>

<p>昨呢絨行情、復又節節升漲、回顧前二日市面、大半每碼升漲三五角以至一元之譜、交易多數買方遷就賣方、否則若一考慮、價又上漲、甚至已被捷足者先登矣、無非鑒於洋貨到源困難、廠貨往後出品、勢必减缺、人心多轉興奮故耳、昨美綸聖誕老人板四呢海力司、每碼一律批沽十一元凈盤、維一有字條　維二十五元半、三十九號漢立蒙二十一元半、福泰元色子貢三十八元、條子春薄花呢四十二元半、法蘭絨三十一元、元常中厚嗶嘰二十二元五角、</p>
<h3>糖市　芝巴德輪荷糖　重行起卸　糖價立跌一二元</h3>
<p>昨糖市因荷輪芝巴德復接總行來電、准予起卸、故該輪裝來洋糖一萬七千五百包、業經昨日起卸於藍烟囱碼頭、故人心回平、遂見鬆淡、公會劃盤、本棧八十四元至八十五元半、小一元、外棧貨八十三元、四元、四元半、五元半、五元、四元、至三元六角、降二元四角、路貨八十四元至三元、小一元、荷棉白BS嘜八十二元、荷赤仍六十五元、太古車白B嘜八十三元至四元、四元半、四元、三元、小二元、下　較堅、DY嘜八十二元半、反升五角、HX嘜八十二元、本一號冰一零七元、晶明冰一百零八元、升三元半、本廠冰花再開二百餘包、七十二元半、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油欲漲不得</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、晟盤承隔日後市轉升之餘威、一度雖達目的、但實銷究屬有限、且期貨拋售尤盛、致人心虛弱、結果欲漲反跌、大有廠油二百擔、價為八十七元至八十六元七角半、大連油一百三十桶、價為一百十二元至一百十二元半、復至一百十二元二角半、三月上交二百桶、價為一百十三元至一百十三元五角、復至十三元、三月下交二百五十桶、價為一百十四元至十四元二角半、復至一百十三元五角、四月上交一百二十桶、價為一百十五元二角半、及烟台聽裝生油二百聽、價為一百二十九元、豆餅一似豆油之漲風在前、入後亦即回挫、結局祗有幾分上落、交易各牌期餅四萬餘片、現餅由汕頭幫辦去大有牌三千片、內地去元隆餅　車、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球劃一廠盤</h3>
<p>——提高質地恢復原價——</p>
<p>煤球行情、前因某新廠成立、同業競爭、暗盤曾跌至一百六十元、昨經同業會議、與其貶價减料、不若提高質地、劃一廠盤、用戶廠家兩受其益、故議決自即日起、恢復原價、大廠煤球、自車每噸一百六十六元、送到另加車力、本街發客、每担仍售九元、</p>

<h3>遠東危機暫不致爆發上海情勢漸平靜　美僑仍在準備撤退事宜　駐滬防軍繼續維護權益　西報認恐惶局面全由投機者掀起</h3>
<p>最近自日本南進野心、日趨積極後、太平洋局勢、驟見緊張、美國爲採取預防步驟起見、又已重申撤僑之勸吿、若風聲鶴唳、有不可終日之勢、但就昨日發展以觀、情形甚爲平靜、似無想像者之緊張、此間美僑、均抱良好精神、接受華盛頓再度發出之迫切警吿、然亦有不完全明瞭其意義者、本市美領署官員謂彼等不能向全體「非必要」美僑解釋國務院二次發出正式警告之原因、但警吿美僑歸國、必有良好理由、則無疑義、領署官員將賡續催促在此緊張時問、並無絕對留此必要之美僑回國、惟署方能給予何種合作、或有何種具體辦法、以促進撒僑之進行、則不甚明瞭、據領署估計、非必要美僑或有三分之二至四分之三、約計一千三百人、業已啟程回美、尙有若干美僑、依理亦應歸國、</p>
<p>仍有的款　足供急需</p>
<p>但依據美國法律、當局不能强迫人民離境、所幸多數美僑、皆竭誠與政府推行其遠東政策相合作、旅滬美僑利用政府特殊計劃、借款充返國川資者、不出二十人、足見美僑殊少乏款難以成行者、然就精神言、出貸川資之計劃、實有採行之理由、此間美當局現仍有的款可得、以備緊急時應用、</p>
<p>美輪艙位　預定一空</p>
<p>據輪船公司消息駛美輪船莫不乘客擁擠、一都份固屬撤退之美僑、一部份則係普通旅客、各船頭等艙船票、現已預定至四月份、普通艙船票至少亦已預定至四個月後、下次駛美者爲二月二十五日離滬之柯立芝總統號輪、船票業已全部售空、</p>
<p>日方認爲　無庸撤退</p>
<p>大陸報云、據同盟社消息、新任駐滬日陸軍發言人秋山少佐、於十五日下午後初次招待本市西籍新聞記者、各記者紛提問話、秋山答覆時、嗤笑外報所載太平洋區益趨緊張之電訊、據稱、渠不解美僑何故離中國、美國冉度勸吿其僑民撒退、事頗可奇、日人希望許多美國友人將留居上海、此種希望、亦適用於各國僑民、初不僅美僑而已、渠與全體日人、俱認日本將「盡力維持和平到底」云、日大使館與海軍發言人之觀察，與秋山完全相符、秋山雖承認遠東局勢更爲困難、但切言上海情勢已轉佳、</p>
<p>規化公民　返美限期</p>
<p>本市美領署某員昨（十五日）晨擊稱、此間美國公民向領　領取新護照者、皆須蓋指印、美國境內實行公民蓋指印辦法、已逾兩年、從總統以下、人人皆已蓋就指印云、關於近傳華人「歸化」爲美國公民者、若不返美、將喪失美國公民資格一說、據美領署某員稱、按照一八八〇年訂定之美國現行一項法律、東方人不能成歸化之美國公民、但外人可獲「重複的」國籍、如得有美國公民資格、而返其誕生地之國家者是、但若輩須於五年內回美國、庶能保持其公民資格、而在美國誕生之東方人、如持有美國護照、亦須依法於五年內返美國、</p>
<h3>西報分析局勢　認爲不必驚惶</h3>
<p>西報分析局勢　認爲不必驚惶宇林西報咋日以「不合理之驚惶」爲題、詳論此間人士最近所發生之恐怖、略謂、上海過去數日所發生之驚惶、實由兩種人所引起、第一種人爲杞憂家、其病在對事實無深刻之硏究、動輒危言聳聽、另一種爲混水摸魚之輩、利用民衆無知、散播聳人聽聞之言論、坐收漁人之利、局勢之嚴重、我人並不否認、然尙未臻於足以令人相驚伯有之境地、此點可以路透社倫教所發來之電報證明、電文稱、「倫敦消息靈通之協約國人士、感覺目下不致立即發生危機」、希特勒盡力設法使日本參戰、以分散英國在非洲之注意力、然渠並未能使日蘇兩國成立一互不侵犯條約、而使日本不能無後顧之憂前、日本決不致貿然南進、故遠東局勢、在日蘇互不侵犯條約成立以前、似不致急轉直下、亦無驚惶萬狀之必要、所可惜者、上海爲一國際都市對造謠生事者、不能繩之以嚴法、更不幸者、竟有若十不法之徒、竟乘機播揚謠言、以圖飽其私囊、即不幸而太平洋中掀起戰爭、我人亦不應似過去二日之惶恐、因之爲全社會之利益計、我人應具明敏之理知、與冷靜之頭腦、決心不爲無稽之謠言所惑、而靜觀事實之眞相、</p>
<h3>美對遠東權益　決不輕予放棄</h3>
<p>自美領署重申撤僑勸吿後、日方復大事鼓吹美國將撤退上海之駐軍、據昨晨出版之每日新聞謂、美麥令隊軍營內、已在收拾零星物件、並將各種軍器整理、移入倉庫中、故美國駐滬軍隊之撤退、僅係時問問題、預料最遲四月底可以實行、但以英方甚感恐慌、故現正向美國方面交涉、請勿實現此一計劃、以維護租界治安、但此一問題、須待赫德大將抵滬、方可決定云云、記者對　述種種、曾詢之美官方、是否確實、據稱、此說完全無稽、以美國務院此次重申撤僑勸吿，完全爲最近遠東局勢不可捉摸、故爲僑民安全計、不得不採此預防步驟、至防軍之撤退、固從未攷慮及此、以上海方面美國擁有絕大之權益、決不致輕予放棄也、</p>

<p>製盒工潮　可望解決</p>
<p>本市製盒業共五百餘家、該業「工會」於上月間要求資方加薪五成、曾經勞資雙方在第一次談判時同意、依照原薪增加三成、第二次談判勞方忽然要求增加一倍、資方因要求成數過大、不能接受、允召集會員大會決議後答復、於本月四日該業公會曾一度召開會員大會、後經一致議決自動加薪、該業公會據情答復「工會」、惟該「工會」認爲不能滿意、巳於本月十二日起全市五千餘製盒工人全體罷工、至今業已四日、在此罷工期內、已有十餘工塲被人搗毀、紙盒被撕者不計、前日勞資雙方代表在錦昌盒廠舉行談判、結果頗爲接近、昨日尙在繼續談判中、聞該業勞資糾紛、不日可望圓滿解決、</p>
<p>皮件糾紛　當局調處</p>
<p>本市各皮件製造廠所雇用之二千四百餘製造皮箱篋工人、日前聯名並委派代表向各該工廠資方提出要求改善待遇及增加生活津貼、因未獲資方允准、致引起全體工人之不滿、於日昨起宣吿聯合罷工、茲悉勞方爲亟謀解決雙方無謂糾紛起見、聞已呈請租界當局政治部出而調處、當局將於明日召集該業勞資雙方代表、舉行談話會議、</p>
<p>美聯工潮　實在情形</p>
<p>據美商美聯實業公司來司於去年十二月三十一日所開除之工人、均係遠反廠規在前、並非無故將工人代表停職、其要求改善待遇條件提出原文中、（二）爲「男女工一律每天增加生活津貼四角、連原有叫角、應改爲每天八角」、及（三）「食米每月增加二斗、連原有三斗、共發給每人每月五斗、男女工一律、並照原定價十四元一石計算、」與各報記載略有不符、而各工人佔據工塲晝夜不去、敝公司爲審愼計、不得不商請捕房暫行勸散、至於敝公司新雇工人一批工作一點、尤非事實、持函聲明、</p>
<p>排印工人　要求加薪</p>

<h3>爲新普育堂呼籲　急不容緩的需要拯救</h3>
<p>在任何地方，尤其是上海，大概可以把生活綫上的人們，分爲三個現象；一種是坐擁巨　毫無顧慮；一種是手胼足胝，以求溫飽；一種是貧窮孤苦無以生存。雖然這些目前的現象，經過相當時間以後，有的是昔日富貴，都成陳跡，有的是昔患不足，而今有餘。可是在這個生活艱難之際，我們目擊這些孤苦同胞，飢寒交迫，我們旣有同情而惋惜的感念，我們自應盡我們的心力，去拯救他們，這是我們所要紀述下邊的事實，來呼籲於讀者之前的一點微意。我們確信讀者必能盡十倍百倍乃至千萬倍於我們的力量，擴大這個同情　量來幼人之幼，來濟人之急，這是任何人所樂於贊助的。</p>
<p>登在下面的一張照片，是未來中國的主人，是多麽可愛活潑而伶俐的天使，可是他們却是從小就遭受悲慘運命的打擊者，他們現在正由上海新普育堂撫養着，祇耍社會人士能够繼續不斷的予普育堂以接濟，自然還有不少待撫養者可以繼續撫養。要是社會人十對於這種慈善救濟事業，因爲沒有能够詳細知道，而還沒有盡濟弱扶傾的責任，那就是我們失於紀述的天職，我們今日從事紀述，也是「盡心力而爲之」的意思。</p>
<p>「惻隱之心，人皆有之」「人之欲善，誰不如我。」祇凶救濟事業，名目很多，待救濟者觸目皆是，往往使有心救濟者有力救濟者不經意的放過，這當然不是不肯救濟，乃是感到無法救濟，因此我們覺得能够從事救濟事業最好，但還要使出錢出力者明瞭這個救濟事業過去的成績和未來努力的方針，已有的基礎如何，現在的狀况如何，將來的計劃如何。這種有辦法的捐輸，當更爲社會人士所樂爲。我們爲創辦三十年的新普育堂呼　捐輸，就是根據這個原則而來的。看呀！從這張照片裹，看見多少孤兒們得到了撫養，成長在林木蔚秀的亭園中，我們何忍使他們有衣食之憂，我們何忍使他們在成長中再遭受挫折？我們更何忍使其他孤兒不克獲得這種仁慈的撫養？</p>
<p>附圖中全體兒童所穿的絨綫衣服，都是安樂紡織廠捐贈，他們這種崇高的同情心，我們是很敬佩的，但是我們相信有同樣同情心的人，一定還不在少數，多救濟一人，也就是多替社會盡了一分心力，安樂紡織廠，這種勇於爲善不求人知的精神，我們認爲是應當表揚的。　（未完）</p>

<h3>讀報有感</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>本月十一日的各報上，登着一則紐約的航訊，大意謂：「中國救濟委員會兒童股，短期內將假此間市政廳，舉行歌詠會，名曰「爲中國而歌」參加者以兒童爲限，門票或付美金一角，或捐代乳粉，維他命丸及魚肝油，以便送往中國，節目開始由中國兒童穿本國服裝，唱國民黨黨歌，次由其他兒童合唱各國民歌。」</p>
<p>讀完這則航訊後，不知各位小朋友可會發生什麼感想？處於海外遠地的兒童，尙刻刻的未忘懷祖國，難道滯留在孤島上的兒童就不應該有了供獻r嗎？我知道你們一定會回答我，不是的！那麼怎樣來供獻出你們的力量呢？</p>
<p>小明友們！你們在學校內的假日不是很多，每星期至少有一天·擇了一個禮拜天，約了幾位同舉或者是同鄰的小伴侶，我們亦可以來舉行什麼歌詠會，參加的量力少捐出些東西，當然有能力的金錢爲最佳，1切與這則航訊內提到的完全相回，不同的唯有規模，你們是小集會；會終後結一結：捐到的余錢有若干？東西有幾件，或者所結的總數是很微小的，可是你們絕對不要看輕了這些，如果全市小朋友肯分頭組成此種歌詠會，那麼總聚的數目，我相信比之將來紐約那裏的成績一定有過之而無不及。至於會中的節目，不必僅限於唱歌一項，其他口琴，舞蹈…等何嘗不可加入；還有地點，如果爲了家庭的地位所限，不妨請求學校當局借一塊地方，你們有着高尙的動機，當局亦總肯接諾的。這時候你們更可以擴大規模至以1級甚至一校爲單位呢！</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！我希望大家能够趕快來發起這種有興趣而又有意義的集會，上海的兒童決不讓紐約的中國兒童專美於前的！</p>
<h3>支配時間</h3>
<p>— 令</p>
<p>我們每逢考試的時候，常常看到有些同學很空閒，而他們得的成績大半很優良，有些同學開早車開夜車拚命的讀着，得的成績不一定優良，這爲什麼緣故呢？並不是那些同學特別聰明，除了他們讀書方法得法外，最重耍的他們會支配時間，他們天天有溫書的時間，所以在考試時能處處泰然了。</p>
<p>有許多小朋友都不會支配時間，不是過分的遊玩，就是過分的讀書，這對於生長期中的小朋友是不適當而有害的。要知道學校寫爲什麼除了讀課本外，還有體育音樂勞作等課目，爲的是使兒童的身心向各方面發展，得到合理的發育，將來可担任一切重大的任務，不過我們在學校裹幾小時的訓練，是不夠的，還得在課餘或假期中有一僩規律的生活，沒有敎師的督促，沒有同學的幫助，須自己管理自己，監督自己，做着有修理的工作。這規律生活並不那樣呆板，用鈴聲來劃分課目，但也要有一個通盤計劃，把時間支配一下，什麼時候應專心的讀書，什麼時候應盡情的運動或遊戲，什麽時候應休息一下身體，什麼時候應幫助操作家事，每天井井有條的完成一天的工作。</p>
<p>我們能完畢每天的工作，又有適當的遊戲和運動，也有相當的休息，那麼不再怕成績低劣，或H作來不反做了，小朋友們，快去試騐一下吧！</p>
<h3>做蠟像</h3>
<p>— 羅盤</p>
<p>哥哥正在看書，弟弟哭喪著臉，帶跑帶跳地跑來了，兩隻手裏各拿著一半石膏模型。口裹喊著：「哥哥！石膏模型壞了！」</p>
<p>「怎樣弄壞的啊！」哥哥抬起頭來問著：</p>
<p>「我看見同學們帶了不少蠟的玩具到學校裏來，有白雪公主啦，矮子啦，魚啦，花花綠綠地很是好玩。他們說是買了石膏模型自己做的，所以我也去買了一個石膏模型來，可是一做就壞，蠟都膠在模型上面了。」</p>
<p>「你問過他們怎樣做法嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有！」弟弟覺得自己太粗心了。組心了。</p>
<p>「做蠟像的時候，先要把模型的內部浸些水，使蠟不致黏起來，然後將融化的蠟傾在模型裏趕快將模的另一半蓋上，四面搖轉，使蠟能很平勻分佈在模型的每一部分，做的時候要手脚快。轉好後略爲等一會，讓蠟凝硬，再把模型浸在水裏，輕輕拉開，蠟像就浮出來了。拿出來之後，還要經過一番修理工夫，將不好的部分修去，於是一隻美麗的蠟像就完成了。」哥哥停了一停，再繼續說：</p>
<p>「我們做的時候，可以將各色的蠟融在一起，配成美麗悅目的顏色，假使做壞了，可以融了再做，所以蠟像確是經濟美麗的玩具。至於你的模型，可以放在火上，慢慢地把點在上面的蠟曉去，只是當心不要把模型再燻黑了。」</p>
<p>弟弟一面答應著，一面忽忙地出去買模型了。</p>
<h3>四隻變八隻鴿子的故事</h3>
<p>— 沈鍚身</p>
<p>虬兒家中本來養着一對鴿子，自從前月那母鴿孵出了兩隻小鴿子以來，現在已有四隻鴿子了。那是前一個禮拜日的F午，虬兒方從一個同學處回家，媽媽就笑嘻嘻的對他說道；「虬兒，你可知道我們家中今天出了一件新聞」虬兒聽了這話，一時倒想不起是什麼新聞，忙問媽媽道：「是什麼新聞呀？」媽媽就對他說道：「今天午飯後，我走上晒臺去給鴿子餵食時，忽然看見晒臺上停着八隻鴿子，仔細一看，其中四隻是我們自家的，而其他的四隻，却是被它們別處去引來的，你想這不是一件新聞嗎？」虬兒聽了這話，就快活得手舞足蹈起來，忙走向晒臺去看時，果然已多了叫隻，這是它們正在鴿棚旁屋簷下舐潤羽毛，而其中的兩隻，顏色呈着金黃色，更覺美麗可愛，這事眞使虬兒高興極了！就不禁自言自語的說道：「開心呀！開心呀！」</p>
<p>這時虬兒的爸爸正從公司中回家，聽得虬兒一個人在樓上說話，便叫他定下樓來，問他什麽事？虬兒便道：「我們自家養着四隻鴿子，今天竟變了八隻，媽媽說這是他們在外來引來的，所以我很快活，」爸爸聽了這話，面上也露出了些笑容，就對虬兒說道：「鴿子是一種最喜歡合羣的鳥類，所以別處的鴿子會和我們的鴿子一起飛回來，他們飛騰極快，記憶力也最强；使把它們放到較遠的地方，一會兒就會飛回原處，所以從前軍隊中常差鴿子傳遞消息，稱爲信鴿；但現在科學昌明，要傳遞迅速消息，有無綫電報可供應用，所以信鴿也不再被軍隊中採用了！」</p>
<h3>幸福人的襯衫</h3>
<p>— 蘭葉</p>
<p>在古時，有一位國王，病得很嚴重，經過許多名醫的診治，所沒有效騐，斯以國王病在床上很是鬱抑，便出了一張吿示，說道：</p>
<p>「有誰能醫好我的病，我就分一半領土給他，決不食言·此佈。」</p>
<p>這樣，便召了很多有博學的人，但是總不能醫好國王的病症。後來有一個醫士經過長久的硏究後，便說：「假使有誰能找到一個美滿而幸福的人，將他所穿的襯衫，脫下給國王穿上，那末立刻就會把國王的病魔驅除。「</p>
<p>於是，國王便命許多使者，分頭去找尋這位幸福的人·可是使者們，自從得到這條命令後，便盡力的往各處去尋找，然而總是尋不到。因爲有錢的人，身體都不健康，健康的人吧，又家境淸寒，若說中等階級吧，也有缺陷的地方。不是他們羨慕富人，便輕視窮人。所以尋來尋去，總尋不到那位醫士所說的幸福的人。</p>
<p>是一個初冬的夜晚，黑沉沉的天空，沒有星月，冷風吹拂着，怪刺人的。周遭沉寂得如死一般，一點聲息都沒有，只聽得破陋的草屋中飛來一片歌聲：</p>
<p>「啊！流着你的血汗吃麺包吧！這樣我才能安眠！這是最美滿的生活啊！」</p>
<p>這時恰巧王子走過，聽了這歌聲，異常的與　。「啊！這是多麼好的敎訓啊！今晚給我發見道個美滿而幸靦的人了。將他的襯衫取來，給病重的父親穿上，那麼他的病就會痊愈了。啊！我是多麽的慶幸呵！」</p>
<p>王子急忙回到宮裏，立刻派使者到這幸福人那裏去取襯衫；使者帶了金錢飛也似的跑到那邊。</p>
<p>可是那個幸福的人，因爲太窮苦，連一件襯杉都沒有。</p>
<h3>小玩意</h3>
<p>— 厚霖</p>
<p>—方塊的蛋—</p>
<p>小朋友！當你看到這個名字，必定要大大的驚奇吧！其實它也不過是一個普通的蛋，略加以做作而已。其製法甚爲容易，只須將完整的蛋放入醋內，經過十天光景，將蛋取出，這時，蛋殼已變軟，然後將它放入方形的模型內，再過三四天後，蛋殼漸漸變硬了，於是方塊的蛋便製成了。</p>
<p>小朋友！當蛋殼變軟的時候，你們若有其他心愛的模型，不妨將它放進去，這樣過了三四天，它將變爲你們心愛的東西了。</p>

<h3>李琦年陳雲裳　她們的會見　在公宴「上海電影之友」席上</h3>
<p>— 南江</p>
<p>從香港北上投入中國好萊塢懷抱而終獲取今日上海電影界崇高地位的，一個是「天之驕子」陳雲裳，一個是「南國影后」李綺年·</p>
<p>美麗的故事已經常在這兩位光芒的藝人身上不斷地傳進影迷耳朶，可是，誰也沒法聽見她們在上海有　一次即使屬諸偶然的會見。</p>
<p>在金鬥，九樓的壽堂裹發現了不少燦耀巨星，有「小鳥」陳燕燕，「小妹妹」黎明暉，及童月娟，李紅，紅薇，夏舫等都穿了盛妝與會，電影界人士如嚴春堂，張善琨，柳中亮，李祖萊等也都出席。</p>
<p>這正是「上海電影之友」余祥琴及其夫人吳蓮影三十雙壽的金門公宴，而這也就是李綺年陳雲裳第二次會見的時候。</p>
<p>正像百樂門余光李紅訂婚那次席上一樣，李綺年陳雲裳的會見彼此都不通淡然一笑，略作點首，李綺年週圍有一大批明星作伴，陳雲裳自然也坐在義姊妹桌，由於爭躍交織的視綫以及自尊心限制了她們的自由，靜默時刻在警示她們</p>
<p>當石　望指揮大衆口琴會員獻奏祝壽歌時，全體賓客唱了，這時，陳綺年陳雲裳也開始一致站立，讓歌聲作了應和</p>
<p>石海倫作「邀舞」的鋼琴獨奏時，陳向其母微笑，李也肅然靜聽，音樂對於她們特別成了嗜好，但李的秘書陳鳳鳴這次却例外的離得很遠。</p>
<p>兩大明星這次的會見，算起來恰足有兩個半鐘頭。</p>
<p>在歸途中，不禁暗暗地想</p>
<p>「偶像們終被創造者所欺騙了。因爲偶像本身已經失去自由，失去自己，祇有一片孤獨和寂寞。」</p>
<h3>父子打對台　蓋叫天有進黃金訉</h3>
<p>— 何</p>
<p>短打武生宗匠蓋叫天，自戰後避難來申，作海上寓公，每年差不多祇演一兩次，去年繼譚富英後在更新舞台演了十三天，成績很是不壞。此老雄心勃發，有東山再起搭長班的意思，並且要和自己的兒子翼鵬，羽鵬和關福等合作。去年歲暮之時，會和更新舞台開過幾次談判，結果沒有成功，因爲翼鵬也已到了挑大樑的地位了。</p>
<p>更新舞臺放棄了邀聘平角的計劃，聘張翼鵬演唱新戲，而黃金大戲院也因平角的抬高包銀，有　改演新戲，不過担任台柱的人材，在　海祇有蓋叫天一人，據說雙方巳經進行談判，蓋叫天爲了要和兒子別別苗頭，倒是極想出山，大概沒有問題，如果成爲事實的話，父子打起對台來，却也有趣。</p>
<h3>大衛夫婦主演　「轟炸機隊」</h3>
<p>— 樹嘉</p>
<p>好萊塢的著名火籍明星大衛尼文，自歐戰爆發後，因祖國正在多事之秋，毅然買掉返央，投效英空軍，爲國宣勞。最近大衛已向英國軍部申請，只等准許令下，便將暫離　伍，回到水銀燈下，爲英美影片公司在英主演一部影片，由現在英國的好萊塢名導演李斯里方登導演，片名「轟炸機隊」，女主角便是大衛的嬌妻安桃芙拉（Ann　dvorak）。</p>
<p>「轟炸機隊」顧名思義，便可知道是以英空里的轟炸機隊爲題材，描寫它攻擊敵人和保衛領土的英勇事蹟，但這「轟炸機隊」不是單純的宣傳片。</p>
<h3>「今日之穌聯」</h3>
<p>三四年前曾有一張「今日之蘇聯國」開映過，不過，它在今天說，已成爲明日黃花了。最化將在杜美開映的「今日之穌聯」，完全是用最新的蘇聯新聞片集合而成，藉蘇聯各部門生活的一斑，反映出蘇聯的全貌。內容有人民生活，城鄉建設，保健情形，藝術活勸，武裝力量等。其中以保健一卷最饒興趣，把蘇聯政府如何關心每一個公民的生老病死的詳情反映無遺。</p>

<h3>America Decides to Defend the Bastion of Democracy, Cautiously Watches the Far East Crisis, and Will Exert Pressure Jointly with Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, and India, Hoping to Keep Japan Neutral in the War</h3>
<p>Washington - Roosevelt yesterday refused to comment to reporters on news of the Far East crisis, saying that the State Department's warning to American citizens to evacuate the Far East was merely a reiteration of previous warnings. The President told reporters to inquire with the State Department about the situation in the Far East. Reporters got the impression that the government is currently cautiously watching the situation in the Far East. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Wisconsin Republican Senator Wiley requested the Senate to hold a special, secret, full-Senate executive session, summoning Secretary of State Hull to report on secret information regarding the Far East and Near East. Wiley stated that the world situation in the coming days is full of explosives, and his suggestion should be adopted immediately. Before passing the Lend-Lease Act, the Senate should confirm the seriousness of the Far East situation. "If the world situation is indeed as bad as others tell us, then we can predict that not only should full authority be given to the President in the Lend-Lease Act, but full war powers should continue to be given as well." "Hitler is trying to persuade Japan to attack British and American interests in the Far East, but I personally do not believe Japan will be foolish enough to rashly attack our country's interests, or attack Singapore." (+5th United Press)</p>
<p>Washington - People here continue to pay great attention to the Far East situation. Although the general impression is that Japan is now engaged in another round of psychological warfare, the situation is indeed taken seriously. Judging from various phenomena, the United States does not seem to be in a position in the Pacific that is more vulnerable to being caught off guard than Britain or the Netherlands. The New York Herald Tribune editorial stated that sudden changes in the Far East occurring during an emergency period will lead to a world war that determines the fate of the earth's command center. Considering the news coming from the Far East and Europe, it truly gives the impression that a large-scale offensive is about to erupt on all fronts. However, upon careful study, there are loopholes in the幕 (screen/backdrop/plot). In the midst of the Far East disturbances, there is probably a large amount of psychological warfare. In any case, Japan's current actions are intertwined with Germany's, and their closeness is almost equal to America's security being tied to Britain's survival. Even if Japan is still hesitant now, it will eventually be like Mussolini last summer, who jumped into the war as soon as he felt that Germany had a victorious aura. Today's war has become a major strategic game, and its result is the fate of the entire globe, which cannot be forcibly divided into a Chinese war or an African war. If Americans are willing, they can cower in a false sense of isolationism and allow this last bastion of democracy to be crushed. However, Americans are not like that, and have chosen a brighter path, backing Britain with their economic power to resist attacks from all aspects. The only possible way to deal with the world's major offensive now is for America to have greater resolve, courage, and preparation to act immediately on any ocean." (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>New York - CBS announced today that the doorman of the Japanese Embassy in Britain gave the most reasonable and simple overview of the Far East situation. The doorman's statement was, "Yesterday we thought we might have to leave, today we think we might have to stay." This news was broadcast to New York by CBS's London correspondent, Murrow, who also said that this was the best comment on the tense Far East situation. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned here last night that Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands Indies are now engaged in the greatest pressure ever exerted on Japan. Authoritative sources say that Germany is putting pressure on Japan to join the war and attack British and Dutch territories in the Pacific. Therefore, the four governments are taking this action simultaneously to jointly resist Germany's pressure on Japan. This action by the four countries has shocked Tokyo and made it afraid to implement past policies and move closer to Berlin. American officials all hope that this action has been successful, at least for the moment. The same source pointed out that in the diplomatic war, if the Soviet Union can negotiate a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, then the Soviet Union can become Hitler's backer. However, if it never fulfills Germany's suggestions, it can also be a backer for the democratic countries. It is said that since the First Sino-Japanese War, Japanese territorial expansionists have dreamed of advancing southward. If Japan is not threatened by the Soviet Union in the north, it may follow the procedures set by Hitler for it. Since the Soviet Union is an incomprehensible mystery, although Japan has repeatedly sung the tune of advancing southward, the cold wind blowing from the Manchurian battlefield has cooled Japan's enthusiasm for joining the Axis powers. Therefore, the pressure from democratic countries makes it very likely that it will remain neutral in the war. (International News Service, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed political sources here believe that, given the tension in the Far East situation, the US Navy will send a fleet of warships to Australia, and it is quite possible that the port of Darwin in northern Australia will be used as a base for the US fleet. It is rumored that Australian Minister to the United States Casey will reveal this intention. (Haishe News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Peiping - The US Embassy in China yesterday advised American citizens in Peiping to return to their home country. There were 470 American citizens in Peiping a few days ago. It is reported that American citizens in Shanghai and Hong Kong have also received the same advice from their country's diplomats. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3>Large numbers of American Aircraft Sold to the Netherlands Indies, and the British Straits Settlements also Obtain Large Quantities of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Washington - It was announced today that the United States sold a large number of aircraft to the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements in December of last year. In December, export licenses for military supplies worth US$3,749,080 were issued to the Dutch East Indies for military aircraft, but only US$1,476,784 worth of goods were actually shipped to the Dutch East Indies. The Straits Settlements obtained export licenses for military supplies worth US$10,250,751, of which military aircraft accounted for US$9,882,353. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Nomura Presents Credentials, Seeks Understanding between America and Japan, Japanese Information Department Advises Overseas Chinese to Secure Their Livelihoods in the Americas</h3>
<p>Washington - The new Japanese Ambassador to the United States, General Nomura, presented his credentials to President Roosevelt in the Oval Office yesterday. The President told Nomura, "We are deeply concerned about the development of the situation between the United States and Japan." Ambassador Nomura replied that he guaranteed to make his best efforts to seek an understanding between the two countries. General Nomura told reporters that President Roosevelt and he had discussed the general situation in the Far East, but he could not reveal the content of the talks. When asked about the news of the Japanese fleet moving south, Ambassador Nomura said that he had not received this information. He then made some vague remarks about the movements of merchant ships and warships in the territorial waters near Japan. Most reporters believed that he meant "the territorial waters near Japan." The movements of Japanese merchant ships and warships are normal matters, but some believed that he meant that the southern territorial waters were "Japanese territorial waters." When reporters questioned him further, Ambassador Nomura only said that he had not received any information. He told President Roosevelt, "The recent developments in US-Japan relations have unfortunately caused considerable concern on both sides of the Pacific. At present, it is necessary to seek an understanding of the positions of both sides to guarantee the rights and welfare of both countries, and to maintain peace in the Pacific and the traditional friendship between the two countries. I am determined to work for this purpose." President Roosevelt replied to Ambassador Nomura, "I welcome your guarantee. I deeply believe in your enthusiasm for this goal. I believe that your long-term association with the American people makes you especially suitable for this position. I and the officials of the government will be ready to provide you with all kinds of conveniences at any time during your mission to our country." Secretary of State Hull personally accompanied General Nomura to the White House. The ceremony of presenting the credentials lasted about fifteen minutes. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Kokumin Shimbun" wrote an article yesterday commenting on Nomura's appointment as Ambassador to the United States, saying that the timing is too late today, and the new Japanese ambassador's mission will definitely be of no benefit. Nomura should not have gone to Washington to take office. Japanese-American relations have deteriorated so much that Nomura's personal friendship with President Roosevelt cannot save them. In fact, Japanese-American relations have fallen to the brink of rupture. The United States' current activities in the Pacific are tantamount to approaching a state of war. The Lend-Lease Act is aimed at Japan, because the act not only aids Britain, but also aids China. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters today that the situation between the United States and Japan is indeed worrying, but it cannot be arbitrarily said that the situation between the two countries will lead to war. The US and Japanese governments are doing their best to prevent the situation from reaching this point. There is no need for agitation. Various propaganda sources all say that the situation between the United States and Japan is extremely serious. A fair observer must recognize that this is a deliberate act by some foreign elements. Tokyo has received news that Japanese communities in the Americas are quite uneasy because of alarming news spreading in North and South America. The Japanese government has warned Japanese immigrants in North and South America not to be disturbed by irresponsible warnings, but to conduct business as usual. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Cabinet Information Department announced recently that although the situation between Japan and the United States is tense, it will not necessarily lead to war between the two countries. The Information Department's announcement was made to Japanese residents in North and South America. The announcement stated that Tokyo recently received reports that Japanese communities on the American continent were quite uneasy because of widespread reports in North and South America that the situation between Japan and the United States had become extremely tense. The situation between Japan and the United States is indeed tense, but it cannot be said that war will occur between the two countries. It must be known that the Japanese and American governments are currently working to prevent the situation from escalating into war. This goes without saying. At present, such strong propaganda from foreign countries must be recognized by neutral observers as an act with ulterior motives by some foreign elements. The imperial government advises Japanese immigrants in North and South America to continue their livelihoods as usual and not to be disturbed by such irresponsible and alarming news. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Australian Embassy in Japan Denies Evacuation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The rumor that Australian overseas Chinese in Japan have received an evacuation order has been denied by a spokesman for the Australian Embassy today. It is said that he has no knowledge of the rumor that the Australian Foreign Minister has instructed the Australian Minister to Japan, Latham, to warn Australians to leave Japan. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>American citizens in Thailand Have Not Received Evacuation Orders</h3>
<p>Bangkok - The American Embassy here recently announced that the embassy has not received instructions from the American government to notify American citizens to evacuate the Far East. Americans here believe that the new instructions to notify American citizens to evacuate the Far East do not include American citizens in Thailand. They also recalled that previous orders from the US State Department to notify American citizens to evacuate did not mention American citizens in Thailand. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Eve of the "Spring Offensive"</h3>
<p>In the news reports of the world situation these days, it seems that abstract words such as tense and serious can no longer describe even a fraction of it. Whether it is the English Channel, the Balkans, Gibraltar, or the South Pacific, there is a sense that the situation is tightening step by step. Everyone's mind is weighed down with many questions: Is the long-rumored "Spring Offensive" about to erupt? What direction will it erupt in? Will it erupt in the East and West simultaneously, or separately in sequence? If Germany moves first, will it carry out a cross-sea attack on Britain, or will it take the Balkans or Gibraltar first? If Japan moves first, will it directly seize the Dutch East Indies, or will it invade Burma first? All of these questions have become the questions that the world is eager to answer today.</p>
<p>The three allied countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan at this stage certainly have a sense of being in the same boat; one side is suffering from the increasing strength of the opposing party, and is very afraid that the future will be long and full of troubles; the other side is intimidated by the increasingly active attitude of the United States, and knows that this will inevitably become a major problem over time; and Italy's combat situation is deteriorating, with a sense that it is difficult to continue. Therefore, they have no choice but to intensify their collusion with each other, hoping to take a risk before the establishment and implementation of the Lend-Lease Act to break the current dangerous situation. This kind of taking a risk and gambling everything mentality is already known to everyone, but before carrying out the adventure, the two countries cannot but carefully prepare their actions and fully estimate their consequences, striving to minimize the risk and maximize the success once the offensive is launched. Because all three parties are filled with a heart of患得患失 (worrying about personal gains and losses), they have exposed the image of mutual deception. Germany is using the bait of facilitating Japanese-Soviet rapprochement to vigorously encourage Japan to advance southward first, in order to facilitate its own offensive against Britain. At the same time, Japan is also eagerly hoping that Germany will attack Britain first or expand the war in other directions, in order to restrain Britain and the United States and allow Japan to complete its 火中打刦 (taking advantage of the chaos) style southward advance policy. Judging from this, although the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have done their best to present a unified appearance, they actually have their own selfish intentions of seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages. Under this situation, it is difficult to assert which of the aggressors in the eastern and western war situations will launch the first attack in the future. The most likely answer is that both sides will launch simultaneously, so that the momentum will be particularly magnificent, and it seems that it will also be more able to restrain the strength of the United States in practice. Whether or not they are launched simultaneously, Japan is ultimately in a supporting role, because its strength has already been consumed by more than half. Even if it wants to carry out a so-called blitzkrieg in Southeast Asia in the future, the certainty of its success will definitely be less than what Germany can achieve in Europe. Moreover, under the current situation where the three countries of China, Britain, and the United States, and even the Dutch East Indies and Australia, share the same hatred and are waiting in strict formation, Japan's chances of succeeding are especially slim.</p>
<p>As for Europe, it is not difficult to imagine that Hitler's planned future offensive will be a multi-faceted offensive. The most familiar to the world is nothing more than the following actions: (1) Using superior air power to cover land forces to directly attack the British Isles: This is certainly an ideal strategy to strike at the British nerve center, but its chances of failure are the greatest, and the cost it requires is also the greatest. If the landing plan cannot succeed, not only will the material losses be severe, but the spiritual consequences that can be produced will be especially terrible. Therefore, unless Germany can do something else in the Mediterranean to force Britain to transfer an excessive amount of its fleet and air force from its headquarters, so as to affect the inherent defenses of the British Isles and give the German army an opportunity to take advantage of, I am afraid that Hitler may not be willing to easily try this landing plan. (2) Carrying out假道 (passing through) Bulgaria or Yugoslavia to directly attack Thessaloniki: Considering the rampant rumors of German troops entering Bulgaria recently, and the South Country's Prime Minister's trip to Germany, it is indeed very possible for Hitler to expand the war to the Balkans. However, before advancing into Greece, there are still some things worth considering. In short, the Soviet Union's intentions, Turkey's participation in the war, and the possibility of Britain launching a large-scale counter-offensive using its Near East base all seem to need to be carefully considered. The support of the public opinion of the two countries, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, also seems to be still up in the air. (3) Pressuring the French Vichy government and Spain's Franco to make them join the Axis powers and allow German troops to pass through to capture Gibraltar, in order to restrain the British Mediterranean fleet and cut off the lifeline of the British Empire. This is an old problem from half a year ago. Considering the meetings of the heads of the three countries, France, Italy, and Spain, Hitler does not seem to have forgotten this. But it is very clear that this move is difficult to fulfill because General Pétain is using overseas colonies and his remaining fleet as amulets, and there are still no signs that he has succumbed to Germany's harsh demands. Moreover, after several years of civil war, Spain, whose power of the Axis powers is declining and whose food still relies on the United States and Britain to provide relief, seems to have even less reason to投羅綱 (throw itself into the net). Moreover, if Spain were to participate in the war, it would be difficult to guarantee that the Republican army, which was defeated by the National Army in the past, would not rise from the ashes and take the opportunity to take revenge, causing the newly stabilized Spanish nation to suffer again.</p>
<p>In summary, Hitler's future offensive is also full of thorns. In the future, unless he can completely clear all kinds of diplomatic and political obstacles and then launch a multi-faceted offensive under more favorable conditions, hoping that Britain will not be able to take care of everything, or hoping to catch it off guard, otherwise, his "Spring Offensive," which he has been painstakingly preparing for, will inevitably disappear with the spring breeze!</p>
<h3>Australian Deputy Prime Minister Declares that the Situation Has Not Continued to Deteriorate, Singapore's Air Force Strengthens, Philippine War Preparations Are Very Tense</h3>
<p>Sydney - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Fadden, after discussing with the Australian Chief of the Defence Staff at the Australian War Cabinet meeting yesterday, announced to the people that the latest information from overseas has not shown signs of continued deterioration of the situation. The War Cabinet received reports on the progress of Australia's defense procedures and discussed the latest telegrams related to the international situation. The warnings that have been issued can indeed be considered necessary so that everyone knows the need for national interests to come first. Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, Brooke-Popham, also attended the meeting of the War Cabinet. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>New York - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Fadden broadcast a speech during the lunch break of the War Cabinet meeting yesterday, urging the people of the whole country to "face the future situation with calmness and determination, and not to easily believe rumors." (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Sydney - Australian Labor Party leader Burton told a secret meeting of trade unions that Australia does not have the nature of being immune from attack. Under the current situation, Australia cannot rely on foreign aid and must rely on itself to resist. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Sydney - Japanese Consul-General Akiyama said yesterday that he did not understand the reason for the Australian Privy Council's recent warning to its people about the possibility of war. Akiyama said that as far as Japan and Australia are concerned, relations are extremely friendly and such alarming news is incredible. He said, "I am receiving telegrams from Tokyo one after another, but there is nothing involving such warnings. I am surprised by such public commotion." (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Melbourne - Representatives of Japanese commercial firms here said yesterday that they had not received instructions to leave the country and said that they firmly believed that there was no danger of war. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi declared yesterday that Japan is now planning to attack not only Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, but will eventually attack the Philippines and Australia. Ambassador Guo said that Japan's first large-scale action will echo Germany's actions in Europe. Ambassador Guo pointed out that Japan's past actions have often coincided with European events. Although Japan is increasingly mired in China, it still intends to hold on to China, but Japan will not be able to because its military strength in China will be weakened by the dispatch of Japanese troops to other fronts. (International Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Tokyo Asahi Shimbun" reported from Singapore that the strength of the British Air Force in Singapore has recently been greatly enhanced. After bomber squadrons were dispatched to the northern border of Malaya, new air forces arrived in Singapore at the same time. (Haitong News, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to the sailors of the Japanese cargo ship "Nihon Maru," the war preparations in the Philippines are very tense. When the ship entered the port of Manila, several American planes hovered over the ship. There were seven or eight American submarines anchored in the port, and there were many new roads built from the coast to the inland, which were obviously for the use of the army. (Haitong News, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Discuss Japan's War Plans</h3>
<p>London - Many newspapers commented on Japan's plans to join the war and attack Malaya and the Dutch East Indies with extremely large headlines, but well-informed sources do not take it with excessive panic. When the Nazi propaganda machine in Japan is doing its best to incite, the danger of extreme elements trapping their country in a reckless gamble in order to compensate for its major losses in China should not be underestimated. However, it is not credible to say that the war in the Pacific will break out in the next few days or weeks. According to the opinions of close observers, Japan is not lacking in level-headed people, politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats, and high-ranking naval and army officers who also advocate moderation. However, they are not well-organized, while the extreme elements who tend towards Nazism are small in number but well-organized. If no changes occur in the next few days, it can be recognized that the Japanese sense of honor will eventually be weighed against Japan's role as Hitler's cat's paw (pulling chestnuts out of the fire). The cunning actions of Hitler secretly concluding a treaty with the Soviet Union in the summer of 1939 should not be easily forgotten by Japan. In any case, Japan will not take any action until Hitler's spring offensive in Europe has been clarified. Especially since there seems to be no clear cause for war between Britain and Japan at present, the Dutch government in London and the authorities in Batavia are still standing firm and refusing Japanese demands. The Times' Dutch reporter said that the Dutch government has recently instructed its minister to Japan to declare to the Japanese Foreign Ministry that the conveners of the Batavia conference are not local authorities, but plenipotentiaries of the central government who bear full diplomatic responsibility for the Netherlands. The Japanese side replied that it fully understood this situation. It is heard that the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Army, Brooke-Popham, has been arranging everything very seriously since taking office, so the entire national defense position is now much stronger than it was six months ago, and the British island outposts between Singapore and Australia are arranged even more powerfully.

(Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The central government has elected Tan Zan as a councilor of the current National 参政会, as stated in the explicit order of the National Government. A reporter visited a responsible person in the central government today to inquire about the selection process. According to reports, the central government previously selected Huang Xiangdi, an overseas Chinese residing in the United States, as a councilor in category D. This was because the quota for overseas Chinese in category C was limited, so one person was added in category D. Later, Councilor Huang passed away overseas. In order to encourage overseas Chinese to participate in discussing national affairs, the National Defense Supreme Council specifically requested the Central Standing Committee to decide to supplement with Tan Zan. Mr. Tan is from Guangdong, approximately 60 years old, and has resided in the central United States for many years, engaging in business. He is enthusiastic about patriotism and has a remarkable reputation, and will surely make many contributions to the 参政会. As for other councilors in this term who have passed away due to illness or have vacancies due to official appointments, it is heard that the Central Standing Committee has decided not to fill them in accordance with the resolutions of previous years.

<h3>Vietnamese Governor Orders the Establishment of an Import Association</h3>

<h3>Japanese Cigarette Sales Surge in Occupied Areas Last Year, Manchuria Tobacco Company Establishes Branch in North China, East Asia Tobacco Company Begins Operations in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to figures released here, of the 68 million cigarettes sold in occupied areas last year, at least 35 million were manufactured by Japanese factories or factories occupied by the Japanese, such as those owned by Chinese merchants. In 1935, approximately 86% of cigarettes consumed in China were produced by British-American Tobacco Company and its affiliated factories, with Japanese products accounting for only 2% and the rest being self-made by China. However, since the outbreak of the war, Japanese products have increased to 50%. Within three months of the start of the war, 21 of the 44 Chinese cigarette factories in Shanghai had been occupied by the Japanese, and 9 were forced to close, resulting in a 42% reduction in Chinese self-made products. The Manchuria Tobacco Company has established a branch in North China, named the North China Tea and Tobacco Company, with exclusive rights in Tianjin and along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The Japanese East Asia Tobacco Company has begun operations in Shanghai. The North China Tea and Tobacco Company is also selling products in Hankou and Guangdong. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia Expresses Refusal to Join the Axis Pact, Reaffirms its Determination to Maintain Neutrality, Prime Minister's Visit to Germany Did Not Sign Any Agreement</h3>
<p>Berlin – Yugoslav Prime Minister Šimović and Foreign Minister Marković returned home yesterday afternoon after holding a three-hour conversation with German leader Hitler at Berchtesgaden. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – An official announcement was made at 9:30 last night: "On Friday, the leader met with Yugoslav Prime Minister Šimović and Foreign Minister Marković at Berghof. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Discussions on various issues of mutual interest were conducted in the traditional spirit of friendship between the two countries." (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Yugoslav officials were tight-lipped yesterday about the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Germany. The government may issue an official report on the talks within twenty-four hours. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London – Authoritative sources here today say that Yugoslavia has no intention of joining the Axis Pact or signing any agreement with Germany. Yugoslav Prime Minister Šimović and Foreign Minister Marković's trip to Germany had one goal: they will reiterate Yugoslavia's determination to prevent the spread of war throughout the Balkans in extremely resolute terms, and will also inquire about Germany's aspirations for the Balkans. British sources said that Yugoslavia has no intention of abandoning its neutral policy. It is said that the mission undertaken by the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister is different from the mission undertaken by Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu on his previous visit, because after Antonescu's visit, Romania succumbed to Germany. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York – A correspondent for the "New York Times" in the Yugoslav capital reported that no agreement was signed during the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Germany. However, they met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in Berchtesgaden. The correspondent also said that responsible officials claimed that the main topic of discussion was Germany's proposal that Yugoslavia should sign an agreement with the Axis powers, but the Yugoslav leaders must consult with Prince Regent Paul before replying, so there were no results. A correspondent for the "New York Times" in Berlin reported that neutral observers in the German capital believed that the above meeting would not have any concrete results, and believed that Germany may demand that Yugoslavia cooperate with the Axis powers in exchange for territory. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia – Diplomatic and independent sources in the capital do not attach much importance to the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's trip to Germany, believing it to be only slightly more meaningful than a ceremonial visit. Most people believe that the mood of the military and the attitude of civilians will make major concessions impossible. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – News last night: After the sudden trip of the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Germany, there is a possibility that German leader Hitler will hold a trilateral meeting with the Yugoslavian leaders. It is said that this expected meeting may allow Germany to gain access to Thessaloniki, the Dardanelles Strait, and the Bosphorus under the guise of passing through Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. It is also said that Germany had previously attempted to bring Bulgaria and Yugoslavia into the Axis powers, but was prevented by Soviet intervention. At this meeting, Germany will reiterate the previous proposal. In view of the fact that Yugoslav leaders suddenly went to Germany without prior announcement, there is much speculation about the extent to which Hitler's talks with Yugoslav leaders can progress. No one believes that Yugoslavia will join the Axis powers alone. Diplomatic circles said that Hitler is preparing for another stage of "diplomatic victory," making Yugoslavia and Bulgaria seek glory and sign on the dotted line.

<p>Rumor has it that German troops are on standby, and Bulgaria may be invaded</p>
<p>Zurich – News here today: German troops in Romania seem to be preparing to invade Bulgaria. A United Press correspondent in the Bulgarian capital reported the news to the United Press office here by telephone. The correspondent said that the number of German troops concentrated on the Bulgarian border is constantly increasing. When asked if Bulgaria might be invaded, the correspondent said, "The German troops are like racers waiting for the order to start, waiting for the gunshot." Bulgarian inspectors did not allow the reporter to elaborate. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Ankara – According to opinions expressed here, if Yugoslav cabinet members do not earnestly declare to Hitler whether the country will take action in the event that Germany invades the Balkans, Germany's plan to occupy Bulgaria may be postponed until the spring at least. Turks all point out that there are only about ten to twelve divisions of German troops currently in Romania that can be deployed to occupy Bulgaria. This force is far from sufficient to establish an effective front line in Thessaloniki. Moreover, if Germany is not sure of the attitude of Yugoslavia and Turkey, which are located on both flanks of Bulgaria, it will inevitably risk additional dangers by rashly sending a small number of troops into Bulgaria.

<p>Two Major Forces Compete, Balkan Situation Delicate</p>
<p>Vichy – Diplomatic figures here believe that the visit of Yugoslav Prime Minister Šimović and Foreign Minister Marković to Berlin is of great significance and will have a major impact on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. The reason is that all countries in the Balkan Peninsula are willing to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Romania therefore ceded Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, Dobruja to Bulgaria, and Outer Transylvania to Hungary. At present, Romania's status is guaranteed by the Axis powers, and it has no choice but to follow the Axis's lead. Second, Hungary has joined the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and is in cahoots with the Rome-Berlin Axis. As for Bulgaria, it is controlled by Soviet forces and is trying to maintain a "balanced attitude." King Boris of Bulgaria's recent visit to Berlin did not seem to have caused any changes in the country's political status, but Britain believes that Bulgaria has already accepted certain restrictions from Germany, which can be seen from British Prime Minister Churchill's recent speech directly warning the Bulgarian government. Earlier, when the Italo-Greek War broke out, general observers believed that Bulgaria would take the opportunity to intervene to satisfy its demands on Greece, namely, that Greece cede the Thracian region to Bulgaria so that it could gain an outlet on the Aegean Sea. However, Bulgaria has always directly raised this issue, and to this day, the Bulgarian capital's radio station has broadcast the news that "the demands we have put forward are nearing realization," which is noteworthy. As for Yugoslavia, although it borders Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Bulgaria, it has made every effort to stay out of the current European war. Not only that, although Yugoslavia is one of the Balkan Entente countries, it has improved its relations with Bulgaria and reconciled with Hungary. At this time, Greece and Turkey are within the sphere of British influence, while Hungary and Romania are controlled by German forces. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are located in the middle, becoming the only barrier between the two major forces. It is for this reason that the Yugoslav authorities have to explain their attitude to Germany. (Fourteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Bulgaria openly demands a sea outlet from Greece</p>
<p>Sofia – A Bulgarian geography professor gave a radio speech last night, stating that Bulgaria's economic situation is such that it is necessary to obtain an outlet on the Aegean coast. The news shocked European countries, but foreign observers here said that the Bulgarian government had made this statement before noon, but had stated that a satisfactory solution should only be reached through peaceful negotiations, so European countries had no reason to be anxious. (Fourteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia – People here were shocked by the news that the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister had gone to Germany, believing it to be the most important event since Germany occupied Romania. Informed sources here, when commenting on this matter, referred to the understanding contained in the Soviet-German agreement that Germany must not interfere in the areas reserved by the Soviet Union, especially those related to Bulgaria. According to people here, it is still too early to predict the consequences of rumors that German troops are stationed on the Romanian border and that Germany is requesting passage through Yugoslavia. According to reliable sources here, there have been many troop movements in the Balkan border area recently. Several Greek divisions have been transferred from Albania to Thrace to prevent sudden actions from that direction, and a large number of Greek people in Thrace are currently migrating out of the area. The "Mir" newspaper here stated that Bulgaria should maintain neutrality and achieve its national demands through peaceful means, and Bulgaria's attitude towards its neighbors has not changed.

<p>Madrid – Both Italian and Spanish officials declined to comment on the meetings between General Franco and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French leader Pétain. The ABC newspaper here carried a dispatch from a Rome correspondent stating that, amidst the rumors, the two place names that have attracted the most attention are Africa and the Mediterranean, where Italy and Spain share common interests. Italian officials were very grateful for General Franco's visit to the country, believing that Spain's confidence in and sympathy for the country could be clearly demonstrated by this trip, and believing that any attempt to undermine the spiritual and ideological connection between the two countries could be eliminated as a result of this meeting.

(Fourteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy – Responsible officials here remained silent yesterday on the talks between General Pétain and General Franco. According to semi-official sources, the talks focused exclusively on issues related to the two countries and would not involve world issues. The issue of Spanish refugees in France, the Moroccan issue, and the issue of transportation and exchange of goods were the main topics of discussion. Authoritative sources here believe that these issues will be discussed further through diplomatic channels. Vichy officials expressed satisfaction with the meeting, and most believed that this was a sign of French-Spanish cooperation. According to Darlan, the issues discussed at the meeting were also beneficial to Germany. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Land and Air Forces in East Africa Cooperate in Fierce Attack on Keren; Continued Progress in the Somaliland Area; Italian-held Leros Island Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Cairo - British military headquarters issued a communique stating that the military operations to capture Keren are underway. British forces are continuing their advance towards Aleitai in rugged terrain. The activities of the Abyssinian patriotic forces cooperating with the British forces within Abyssinia are rapidly expanding their control. There are no changes in the battle situation on other fronts. Furthermore, the British Middle East Air Force Command issued a communique yesterday that on the night of February 12th, British heavy bombers fiercely attacked the port of Vits Island, which is under Italian control, setting several fires. British bombers were intercepted by a squadron of Italian fighter planes in the Beratte area. Two Italian planes were shot down. Two British bombers did not return. It is now reported that British forces have discovered another 54 unusable enemy aircraft in Banniina and Bacca. In the past two days, enemy aircraft attacked the Banniina airfield, but the damage was minimal. Bengasi was subjected to a night air raid by German aircraft on February 12th, and bungalows suffered slight damage. British aircraft in Italian East Africa are continuing to assist the army in the offensive in the Keren area. The Keren railway station was hit by a bomb, and enemy concentration points near Mount Amba were also heavily bombed. Yesterday, British fighter planes engaged enemy fighter planes in an encounter over Malta. One Junkers enemy aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire, caught fire, and crashed. It was no longer able to return to its base. All British planes returned safely. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss the Lend-Lease Bill; Senators Will No Longer Offer Opinions; It Could Become Law Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>Washington - After the House of Representatives passed the "Lend-Lease Bill," the Senate has scheduled a meeting for the 17th to discuss it. Senate Democratic Leader Barkley recently stated that it would not be surprising if the Senate passed this bill by a two-to-one majority. Some senators originally wanted to express their opinions during the discussion, but they have now decided to refrain from doing so. Therefore, the discussion period will be very short. This bill could become law within ten days. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Political figures say that Willkie, the Republican pre-election candidate, firmly supports the Lend-Lease Bill. Although he has the support of most members of the party, there are also many opponents. For this reason, the Republican Party may split. This can be seen from the fact that when the Republican Party held a memorial ceremony on the 12th of this month, the birthday of the late President Lincoln, Willkie attended and delivered a speech, but other important figures such as former President Hoover and Landon, the candidate for the 1936 election, did not participate. In addition, some Republican members of the Senate and House of Representatives have also condemned Willkie for failing to consider the party's platform. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Differing U.S. Opinions on the Issue of Supplying Destroyers to Britain</h3>
<p>Washington - Regarding the issue of the United States supplying destroyers to Britain, Willkie gave his opinion to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after returning from Britain, urging the Navy Department to supply Britain with five to ten destroyers each month to protect maritime merchant fleets. However, Secretary of the Navy Knox said that the United States should not provide more destroyers to Britain, otherwise it would hinder the strength of the country's fleet. This debate has attracted the attention of political figures here, who are commenting on it. Those who support Willkie say that according to the German High Command's announcement today, thirteen British merchant ships, fully loaded with military equipment from the United States, have been sunk by German warships in the waters off Portugal. Based on this, the United States urgently needs to continue to supply Britain with destroyers. Moreover, the United States has many old destroyers with low speeds. The United States currently has no need to protect merchant fleets, so these warships are useless. If they are given to Britain to protect merchant ships, it will be of great benefit. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - When President Roosevelt met with reporters today, a reporter asked the President about the debate between Secretary of the Navy Knox and Willkie regarding the issue of the United States supplying destroyers to Britain. He replied that this issue is quite complex and is currently under study. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Plans to Build Naval Base on Samoa Island; a Key Point in Pacific Strategy</h3>
<p>Washington - Several senior naval officials told the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that the Navy Department intends to establish a complete naval base on Tutuila Island in the Samoan Islands, because the island has great military value in the U.S. Pacific defense plan. At the time, Georgia Democratic Congressman Vincent asked, "Does this mean establishing a complete naval base in the Samoan Islands?" Rear Admiral Hill, one of the commanders, replied, "Yes." He further explained that the increased power of the air force has given Samoa new military value, and the area is now considered "the southwestern point of the entire Pacific line."</p>
<h3>House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Funding for Fortifications on Guam</h3>
<p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday approved a proposal to increase the operational convenience of Guam warships and construct air-raid shelters with $4,700,000 without comment. However, this controversial issue still needs to be discussed in detail at the next executive meeting. Chief Civil Engineer Rear Admiral Morell said that the Guam budget is entirely for improving military port construction, but he was unwilling to discuss the air-raid shelter budget in public. However, according to Morell, this measure is to protect the safety of key figures, which he believes is very important. New Hampshire Republican Congressman Jenks suggested that the budget was starting Guam's defense work regardless of previous congressional opposition. He said that the Pacific is an ocean, and he doubted whether the United States would extend its defense to it. Minnesota Republican Congressman Maas said, "This is exactly why we need this measure."</p>
<h3>Authorize Secretary Knox to Enhance Philippine Defense</h3>
<p>At the same time, the House Naval Affairs Committee unanimously approved authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to sell old naval equipment to the Philippine government at any time, but stipulates that once the Philippines becomes independent, the Secretary's power will cease, and stipulates that the Philippines is not allowed to transfer items taken from the United States to other countries. Members of the Naval Affairs Committee believe that the bill can be quickly processed in the House because the situation in the Pacific is very tense. Washington Democratic Congressman Magnuson said that he believes that the first military equipment delivered to the Philippines will be torpedoes needed by the island's torpedo fleet. He said that this step is more friendly to the Philippines, and the Philippines will receive a steady stream of American aid in the future. The bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to handle the purchase of military equipment for the Philippines. Magnuson said that he believes that the Philippines will obtain old American equipment at a very low price. He said that what the Philippines needs most now is torpedoes, currently needing about a thousand. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Greek Forces on Albanian Front Launch Full Offensive; Battle Line Extends Eighty Miles; Seven Thousand Blackshirts Captured</h3>
<p>London - The Athens radio station stated that yesterday, Greek forces continued their offensive along an eighty-mile battle line within Albania, capturing 7,000 Italian soldiers in one location, including many officers.

Greek forces have launched an offensive in the entire area of the source of the Shkumbin River. On the northern line, from Tepelenë to Moscopole, Greek artillery heavily bombarded Italian artillery positions. The front line was covered by low clouds, so air activity was suspended.

<h3>German Warships Active in the Atlantic; Six British Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Funchal, Madeira - According to survivors who arrived here after being rescued, a Nazi raider of the "Admiral Hipper" class attacked a British convoy in the waters between Madeira and the Azores at 10:00 AM yesterday, sinking six British merchant ships. When the German raider attacked the British convoy, the British ships also fired back for half an hour. As a result, six ships in the convoy were sunk, and the raider appeared to be undamaged and escaped. About a hundred survivors landed here. They said that the raider was a modern warship, so sailors believed that the ship must be one of the "Admiral Hipper" class cruisers. The Admiral Hipper class cruisers were completed between 1935 and 1936, with a displacement of 10,000 tons and eight 8-inch guns and twelve 4.1-inch guns. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Thailand Expresses Friendship to Britain; Does Not Antagonize Any Great Powers</h3>
<p>Bangkok - Newspapers here today carried articles stating that the Thai government firmly believes that although Britain has strengthened the defense of the Malaya-Thailand border, it will not invade Thai territory. This can be seen from the communique issued by the Thai government. The Seri newspaper said that although Britain is one of the great powers, it has always sympathized with Thailand. When Germany, Japan, and France pressured Thailand to the point of almost declaring war, Britain always intervened. Therefore, in the current crisis, the Thai people do not need to worry too much about Britain strengthening the defense of the Malaya border. Britain's integrity is well-known and will never infringe upon Thai sovereignty. The Suphapburus newspaper said that although Thailand accepted Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, this move does not mean that Thailand has joined Japan or Japan is trying to win Thailand over to its side and antagonize any great powers. Some people believe that since Thailand accepted Japan's mediation, it will side with Japan to resist Britain. They do not know that the Thai government has repeatedly stated that it will strictly adhere to neutrality and implement a friendly policy with all countries, so it will never antagonize any country. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

Oshima continued, "This is my first trip to Russia, and I feel very happy." After meeting with the Japanese ambassador to Russia, Tatekawa, he is scheduled to take a special Siberian Railway train to Germany tonight, and will arrive in Berlin around next Monday.

<h3>The Smokescreen in the Balkans</h3>
<p>This is a radiogram from the New York Times' European correspondent. A partial translation follows:</p>
<p>The Balkans are shrouded in a kind of smokescreen. This smokescreen is not the fire of war, but is deliberately created by German propaganda. In other words, it is still the masterpiece of German Propaganda Minister Goebbels.</p>
<p>At first, the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, assured the government of his host country that Germany had no ulterior motives in the Balkans. German secret agents in the capitals of Yugoslavia and Switzerland spread rumors that German troops were concentrating in Romania. Meanwhile, in the capitals of Romania and Hungary, the shadow of the bow in the cup spread that German troops were concentrating in Hungary. After these rumors spread everywhere, German embassy staff in Romania and Hungary went their separate ways to refute the rumors, categorically denying these slanderous words.</p>
<p>Germany repeatedly rotated this propaganda strategy inside and outside the Balkans, causing panic and unrest. The German army was able to use this smokescreen of creating and refuting rumors to maneuver freely, secretly preparing to launch a new offensive against the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Greece, or other anxious countries. Although these propaganda are only bluffing.</p>
<p>In summary, there are two major factors in the Balkans: First, a practical standstill; second, 1.5 million German fully armed soldiers are idle and have nothing to do.</p>
<p>According to Soviet intelligence, Germany has concentrated about eighty divisions in the vicinity of the Soviet border, from East Prussia to the Black Sea. The Soviet Union also has sufficient troops ready and waiting. In addition, Germany has sixty divisions stationed in newly occupied or annexed areas for suppression purposes, but there are another sixty fully equipped divisions that have not been mobilized, and their actions are of great concern to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Moscow is so worried because Germany is said to have sent six or seven divisions of winter-equipped troops into northern Romania, and another ten to twelve divisions are scheduled to arrive before February 15. About five more divisions have also arrived on the Danube line.</p>
<p>However, these are all speculations and cannot be fully believed. At least a part of them are Germany's smokescreen effect. The only thing that is absolutely certain is that German troops have not yet entered Bulgaria, and Turkish troops have been constantly on the alert for months in case of unexpected events.</p>
<p>Although most people believe that the concentration of German troops is indeed happening, and that immediate action is even possible, Turkey can still remain calm and unmoved, believing that Germany's Balkan policy is more threatening than action. Turkey also believes that once it is drawn into the vortex, the Soviet Union will definitely provide deep assistance with oil and food, just like assisting Greece.</p>
<p>Turkey has always adhered to its alliance with Britain, and has not changed its attitude even when France was defeated and Britain was in dire straits last June. Greece also knows that Turkey is reliable, and believes that Turkey and Bulgaria can protect the security of its right flank, so it has withdrawn a large part of the troops stationed near the Bulgarian border to reinforce the front line.</p>
<p>According to London's observations, Germany's current problem seems to be launching a spring offensive to help Italy fight Greece. There are only two ways to invade the Balkans. One is to cross the Bitolj Pass from Yugoslavia and head straight for Thessaloniki in Greece. However, the Greek army has already occupied Korçë in Albania, and is strong enough to control the Bitolj Pass. Moreover, if Germany advances from this route, it must first clash with Yugoslavia. The other route is to take Romania and Bulgaria to shake Greece's flank. Although this route is conducive to tank warfare tactics, it requires preparing to directly quarrel with Bulgaria and indirectly with Turkey, and it is doubtful whether the Soviet Union can sit idly by again if it sees German troops penetrating deep.</p>
<p>Once Turkey has an incident, allied Britain will also provide assistance with its navy and part of its air force, and will provide as much financial and material assistance as possible.</p>

<h3>Finance: Those with Foreign Exchange Are Uneasy; Fierce Sales Are Increasing</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's listing showed no change. In the unofficial market, the British and American exchange rates continued to loosen significantly. This was because Chinese merchants and speculators, seeing the various tensions in the international situation, tended to aggressively sell. Those holding foreign exchange, seeing the situation, also eagerly sold, resulting in the sale of another 1.4 million yuan of American exchange within half a day, with prices ranging from 5.5625 to 5.59375 yuan. However, after 10:00 AM, people became even more nervous, because they expected that once a war broke out in the Far East, China's foreign trade would change from an import surplus to an export surplus, and the demand for foreign exchange drafts would be extremely small. Therefore, the selling trend became even more intense. At around 11:45 AM, speculators sold American exchange for this month as low as 5.625 yuan. The result of the noon closing was that spot British exchange was 3 shillings 4 53125 pence, and American exchange was still 5.625 yuan, an increase of 0.046875 and 0.09375 respectively compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>The downward trend of market prices is becoming more intense</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's large條(large bar of silver) was down 0.0625 for the near term and flat for the far term. New York silver prices were flat. London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates: British to American unchanged; British to Shanghai up 0.03125; American to British unchanged; American to Shanghai up 0.02; American to French no market. The central government's listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices: British gold at 3 shillings 4.0625 pence, American exchange at 5.53125 yuan, unchanged from the previous day's closing price. After opening, the selling trend was already fierce. The selling by Chinese banks and speculators was particularly strong, all of which was absorbed by certain American banks, British banks, McCalley, and HSBC, etc. It was calculated that the price for February was 5.5625 yuan, reaching as high as 5.59375 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged. After that, it was heard that the general estimate was that if a war broke out in the Pacific, China's import settlements would be reduced, while export exchange drafts would increase, which would have a close relationship with going long on foreign exchange. Therefore, speculators sold more and more aggressively. February's rate fell to as low as 5.625 yuan, and March's rate also fell to 5.59375 yuan, still being bought by 利和某美行. This was around 11:45 AM. Not long after, the market closed. Spot and this month's British exchange closed at 3 shillings 4.53125 pence, and American exchange at 5.625 yuan. Next month's British exchange was 3 shillings 4.4375 pence, and American exchange was 5.59375 yuan, an increase of 0.046875 and 0.09375 respectively compared to the previous day's price. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rates Decline</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were all unchanged. Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by 4 yuan, to 440 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was flat. All exchange rates showed no improvement. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Plunge Spreads: Lowest Price Outside the Exchange Reaches 6,060 Yuan; Spot Goods Offered at 200 Yuan Premium</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a sudden and alarming collapse, with the downward trend intensifying once more. Amidst the chaos, gold prices successively broke through the 6,300 and 6,200 yuan levels. Because Saturday only had a half-day of trading, the price outside the exchange broke through the 6,100 yuan level in the afternoon. Everyone's expectations were uniformly downward. This was due to the increasingly deteriorating international situation, which continued to worsen. Foreign exchange was subject to speculative selling of millions of US dollars, only rising and never retreating. Although there were rumors of the Dutch ship resuming its voyage and tensions in the Far East easing slightly, the selling pressure had already begun, making it difficult to reverse the decline. Cheung and Wing were the sole sellers, while securities firms, money exchanges, and foreign exchange dealers were thriving. The price plummeted from 6,300 yuan at the opening to 6,130 yuan before the midday close, a sharp drop of over 185 yuan. More than 20,000 taels were traded in the half-day. Cash prices remained higher than forward prices. Shing sold 50 taels for an additional 150 yuan, and Wing sold 100 taels for an additional 170 yuan, both bought by Kwong Hing Wing. Later, there were buyers at a premium of 200 yuan. In swap transactions, February was rolled into March, initially with the seller, Sing Kee, paying the buyer, Tai, 70 taels for 5 yuan. Cheung Wo Loi then offered, rising to 17 yuan. Kung Wo finally offered Cheung Wo 30 taels for 12 yuan. Gold ornaments at jewelry stores were listed at 10 yuan less, at 650 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Futures Drop Close to 6,000 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (ten taels) was sold amidst intense pressure, with the price already quoted as low as 6,300 yuan. The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,290 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Tin Yuen initially bought more than 100 taels, raising the price to 6,300 yuan. Foreign exchange was reported to be easing, but a sudden wave of selling emerged. Sun Fung Wing Hop Shing and foreign exchange dealers rushed to sell, while Cheung and Wing money exchanges assisted retail investors in their frantic selling. The price quickly declined by 90 yuan to 6,210 yuan. News of the Dutch ship resuming its voyage arrived, and Tak Fu and Sing Kee made large purchases, while Sun Fung Wing covered their short positions, raising the price to 6,265 yuan. However, as foreign exchange continued to ease, another wave of selling soon emerged. Tung Hong Wing, Cheung Hing Wing, Shun Yuen, and Tak Shing retail investors only focused on selling, driving the price down by another 135 yuan to 6,130 yuan. The midday close was at 6,135 yuan, a further decrease of 185 yuan from the previous day. It has been declining for three consecutive days (excluding swap transactions), with a total drop of 345 yuan. Based on the US dollar exchange rate at the midday close of 5.59375, the price was 6,225 yuan, a difference of a significant 90 yuan. However, this was a phenomenon of futures trading. As for spot goods, even with a premium of 200 yuan, they were difficult to find. Since one is virtual and the other real, it is difficult to compare them. However, the current price manipulation is also a normal occurrence. After the close, there were sellers at 6,100 yuan. The range for the morning session (excluding after-hours trading) was 170 yuan. In the afternoon, there were transactions outside the exchange at 6,060 yuan, and the final price was 6,080 yuan. The selling price of cash dealers' own-brand gold was 220-230 yuan higher than the forward price. The buying price was 6 yuan lower than the selling price. The current margin gold still has no price.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Listed at Only 10 Yuan Less</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at jewelry stores, initially listed at 660 yuan by Tai Tung Hong and Sun Tung Hong, was reduced by 10 yuan at 11:15 AM, to 690 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan, it was said.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various currencies saw a large drop in prices. British and American gold pounds also plummeted by five yuan. British gold notes remained stable, and the market price remained level. American gold notes continued to decline, with the price falling from 17 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen to 17 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen, a decrease of 4 jiao from the previous day. Hong Kong notes suddenly rebounded by 6 fen. Canadian and Philippine notes both trended downward. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended upward, with the former rising to 1 yuan 7 jiao 4 fen and the latter rising to 1 yuan 3 jiao 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Metals: Sales of Iron from the Wai Say Company and Iron Street Are Excellent</h3>
<p>Transactions of iron from the Wai Say Company have been relatively active recently, as canneries, toy factories, and printing plants on this street all have demand, and the quantity is not small. Although merchants from other ports such as Tianjin and Qingdao have not been seen purchasing, it is difficult to curb the rising trend. Therefore, those in this business have good expectations. Yesterday, the quoted prices rose step by step. For example, each crate of 200-pound old steel from the steel factory sold for 200 yuan, and new steel from the steel factory also required 190 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Small Gardenia Arrives Sparsely; Price Rises More Than 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Small gardenia is scarce due to limited sources and high foreign costs. In addition, the price of the goods that arrived last year was relatively high and remained firm. Therefore, the market sentiment is very strong. It was reported that dozens of packages had been released, with prices rising by more than 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Rise Again to the Limit; But Another 60,000 Bags of Rice Are Seen; Rice Price Increase is Purely Speculative</h3>
<p>The foreign rice that rose sharply the day before, initially due to the falling gold price and rising exchange rate, softened again at one point. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the market was even more stimulated by rumors that the situation in Southeast Asia was becoming more urgent and that conflict between Japan and the United States was unavoidable, causing people's expectations to rise further. People started buying early, and the rumor that rice loaded on the Dutch ship would be returned to Hong Kong further exacerbated the situation. General speculators and retailers scrambled to buy, and selling prices reached the limit. However, those who were buying eventually felt that the surge was too strong, and after hitting a wall, they lacked hope and faced difficulties. Therefore, this price did not take hold and turned towards stability. However, with people's expectations fluctuating, general sales from local stores suddenly surged amid the stability, and large quantities were sold. The market shape returned to chaos. Small-batch rice even reached the limit, opening at 76 yuan. Pudong wharf reached 75 yuan 3 jiao, while Bank wharf No. 1 Saigon reached 84 yuan 5 jiao. Only fire-batch and No. 1 Siam rice were slightly inferior due to abundant market supply. Afterwards, the market became lively, and by noon, buyers had enough. Profiting speculators took advantage of the high prices to sell because the rice on the Dutch ship was still being unloaded. However, closing prices were 1 to 1.5 yuan higher than the previous session. No. 1 Saigon was 84 to 83.5 yuan, No. 2 was 79 to 78 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 83 to 82 yuan, Zhongguan was 80 yuan, No. 2 was 79 yuan, Fire-batch was 82.5 to 81.5 yuan, high-grade rice was 83 yuan, small-batch rice was 75 yuan 8 jiao to 75.5 yuan, old rice was 74.5 yuan, Pudong wharf was 75 yuan, and Tokyo grinded Zhongguan was 73 to 74 yuan. Rice from Mid-Year was from 73 yuan, Medium to 70 yuan, broken tip rice from 67 to 64.5 yuan. Forward rice was flat and soft. No new transactions were made. Futures prices retraced. Saigon No. 1 road goods opened at 96.5 yuan, No. 2 spot goods at 91 yuan 1 jiao, February at 94 yuan 2 jiao, small-batch spot at 89 to 88.5 yuan, March at 87 to 88.5 yuan, 89 yuan, broken rice end of February at 75 yuan 3 jiao to 75 yuan 8 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 700 to 800 tons. There were 15,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrived in port again yesterday. The French ship (Albert Sarraut) from Saigon, managed by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, brought 2,400 tons, approximately 24,500 bags. The details of its arrival in Shanghai were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the ship arrived at the port at about 5 PM yesterday and docked at the Pudong Longmao Wharf for unloading. The Java Company's ship, Ziba德輪, transported more than 33,000 bags from Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai at around 6 PM the day before yesterday and docking at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf. Before the ship arrived in Shanghai, it had received instructions from the head office to return to Little Luzon. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai the night before last, it urgently planned to set sail after the passengers disembarked, transporting the 3,300 tons of foreign rice, 400 tons of corn, rubber, and other goods to Hong Kong for unloading. The night before last, before setting sail, it suddenly received a telegram from the head office, allowing the ship to unload the rice and sugar in Shanghai. Therefore, unloading began yesterday.</p>
<p>Although the path for thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice is not as wide as that for foreign rice, domestic arrivals are also scarce. Seeing foreign rice soaring, they followed suit and rose by half a yuan. Regular white japonica was 108 yuan per dan, especially 104 yuan per dan. Kunshan high-quality white japonica was 106.5 yuan, 106 yuan per dan, especially 102.5 yuan, 100 yuan, Zhongguan 99 yuan, 98.5 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice dan was 96 to 95 yuan.</p>
<p>As the new year has passed, glutinous rice sales are about to decline and continue to be weak. Fortunately, the market supply is limited, and the market can still be maintained without change. Hong Kong special yuan still sells for 81 yuan, ordinary 80 to 78.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Agar-Agar Takes Advantage of the Situation to Speculate</h3>
<p>The agar-agar market situation is quite firm and high. This is because the international situation is tight, and there are concerns about the impact on foreign sources. Currently, the inventory is not sufficient, and there are concerns about whether large quantities of goods can be loaded as scheduled. Therefore, people are taking advantage of this to be optimistic. Those holding goods are all holding firm and waiting for an opportunity. The morning market trading was limited. The Clock Tower brand Australian agar-agar was 24 yuan, with little supply. Road goods were also speculating at the same time. As a result, spot goods were held firmly without opening. Only 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Clock Tower brand road goods were traded, at a price of 23 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, an increase of 3 to 4 jiao from the previous day. Sales of Hua Factory's plain agar-agar also increased. 6,932 bags were sold by the two factories, all of which were purchased by retailers on this street. The price was still 23 yuan, it was said.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation is also quite firm and strong. With both inventory and arrivals being low, and amidst calls for higher prices in the agar-agar market, people's expectations are even stronger. However, the Japanese factory has not officially eased its purchasing price for the time being, and the Chinese factory has not eagerly purchased either. Therefore, the market is still quiet. It is heard that the asking price in the market is as high as 39 yuan per 100 jin of Do麦, but there has been no corresponding transaction.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Prices Plunge; Double Horse Suffers a Sharp Drop of 110 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market plunged, falling in a straight line. This is because the tense situation in the Far East has caused people to panic, and bulls are increasingly uneasy. At the same time, actual sales have stagnated, and speculative winds are even more severe. The market could not withstand the pressure and fell. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,326 yuan, the low price was 1,220 yuan, it rose to 1,228 yuan, and then to 1,215 yuan. As a result, the price plummeted by 110 yuan compared to the previous day. Such a violent drop is terrifying. Twenty-seven pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The Double Horse market opened in the morning with a relatively calm situation. The opening price was 1,326 yuan. With this opening, selling pressure remained strong, falling to 1,270 yuan. There was a slight short covering in the middle, rising to 1,284 yuan, fluctuating between 72 and 82 yuan for an hour. It was then heard that the exchange had a limit down. Foreign exchange was released, and the gold price fell. People in the market suddenly became fearful, and investors rushed to sell, causing the market to be unsustainable and fall straight to 1,228 yuan. Profiting investors covered their positions, rising to 1,238 yuan. However, the market softened again at the close, falling to 1,218 yuan. The transaction volume for the half-day was 6,580 bales. The quantities purchased by various ports are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo 30, Hong Kong 0</p>
<p>Same Trade 6,0, Statistics 6,580</p>
<h3>Cotton Also Plummets</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation, following the sharp fall in the yarn and cloth market, is also silent, with no one inquiring. Cotton prices are down by about 10 to 20 points. There were no transactions. In the New York cotton market, due to the liquidation of long positions and the weakness of Wall Street stocks, the market was weak, resulting in a further drop of about 10 pounds sterling compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>Indian cotton remained flat. Yesterday, the combined forecast fell by only one rupee.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday, due to the strong decline in spot yarn prices, and the unfavorable environment for raw cotton transactions, people remained weak and the market situation gradually declined.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Buying Interest Turns Strong</h3>
<p>——Frequent Decline of English Bank Stocks——</p>
<p>Public bond after-hours trading only lasted for half a day yesterday. The market situation continued to fluctuate amidst competition between bulls and bears, rising and falling erratically. The bulls and bears engaged in several rounds of pushing and pressing. The bulls exerted their full strength in the last few minutes, and the closing price was ultimately dominated by the bulls. Its trend is different from the natural rise of last year, and it feels very forced. Yesterday morning, in half-day trading, Ren Chang and Xin Fu, and Juxin bought the most, followed by Chang Tai and Lian Yi. The capital side was mainly Tung Hong, Xinhua, Hong Da, and Zhongyi, followed by Chang Ding, Hong Lian, and Dun Yu. The speed and magnitude of the market price fluctuations were great. The attention of the entire market was almost entirely focused on types A and C, and the trading volume of types E and D was very small, so their prices were uniquely different. As a result, all continued to rise by 4 jiao to 1 yuan 4 jiao, with a total effect of about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Type A 71.40 70.00 71.40 Up 1.40</p>
<p>Type B 66.30 65.40 66.30 Also Up 1.10</p>
<p>Type C 63.40 61.40 63.40 Also Up 0.80</p>
<p>Type D 60.30 60.20 60.30 Also Up 0.40</p>
<p>Type E 61.50 60.20 61.00 Also Up 0.90</p>
<p>In stock trading, 40 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory were traded at a price of 19 yuan 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Friday) telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks are still flat and weak. Bank stocks have fallen sharply. The stock of Mecca Bank fell by 12 shillings and 6 pence, the price is 7 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. The English registered stock of HSBC fell sharply by 5 pounds, the price is 70 yuan. Also, Hong Kong registered stock also fell by 3 pounds, the price is 77 pounds, there is a market without transactions, and the rest are unchanged.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Only Seen Being Offloaded; Eastern Piece Goods and Fine Cloth Plunge by Four Yuan</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market continued to plunge yesterday. This was because of the emergency in the Pacific situation, people were panicked, and all cloth tended to be sold off. Buyers were extremely lacking, so all sales were pushed down. White goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 1 to 2 yuan per piece. Coarse cloth and coarse twill fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece. The market situation for bleached and dyed cloth was chaotic, generally falling by more than 1 yuan per piece. More than 200 pieces of various cloth were traded on this street. Zhejiang Road, Jiaotai, helped sell 40 to 50 pieces of colored cloth and fine twill. Fujian and Guangdong helped sell 100 to 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. More than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and Shilin colored cloth were sold by the Northern Road Yanjin help. On the 16th, 416 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth market crashed yesterday. Fine cloth plunged by 4 yuan per piece. The spot leader opened in the morning at 44 yuan 5 jiao, falling straight to 41 yuan 1 jiao at the closing price (exchange). Futures for this month also fell to 42 yuan 01 fen. This was because customer sales were blocked, and those inside and outside the industry were fearful and timid, and sold off unanimously, resulting in a situation of exhaustion and inability to recover.</p>
<h3>Woolens Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen market saw prices rise steadily again. Looking back at the market situation in the previous two days, most prices rose by 3 to 5 jiao or even 1 yuan per yard. Most transactions saw buyers accommodating sellers. Otherwise, if one hesitated, the price would rise again, or even be preempted by others. This is because it is difficult for foreign goods to arrive, and the output of factory goods is bound to decrease in the future, which has made people excited. Yesterday, Marlene Santa Claus, four-ply Hailis, was wholesaled for 11 yuan net per yard. Wei Yiyou's patterned one was 25.5 yuan, Han Limeng No. 39 was 21.5 yuan, Fook Tai Yuen's colored zigong was 38 yuan, patterned spring thin flannel was 42.5 yuan, and Yuen Chang's medium-thick serge was 22.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Ziba德輪 Dutch Sugar; Re-unloading; Sugar Prices Fall Immediately by One to Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, because the Dutch ship Ziba德輪 received a telegram from the head office, allowing it to unload, the 17,500 bags of foreign sugar loaded on the ship were unloaded at the Blue Funnel Wharf yesterday. Therefore, people's expectations returned to normal, and the market became soft. The association's price was 84 to 85.5 yuan per bag at the main warehouse, down by 1 yuan. External warehouse goods were 83 yuan, 4 yuan, 4.5 yuan, 5.5 yuan, 5 yuan, 4 yuan, to 3 yuan 6 jiao, down by 2 yuan 4 jiao. Road goods were 84 yuan to 3 yuan, down by 1 yuan. Dutch cotton white BS mark was 82 yuan. Dutch red sugar was still 65 yuan. Taikoo trolley white B mark was 83 to 4 yuan, 4.5 yuan, 4 yuan, 3 yuan, down by 2 yuan. The lower brand was firmer, DY mark was 82.5 yuan, up by 5 jiao. HX mark was 82 yuan. The factory's No. 1 rock sugar was 107 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 108 yuan, up by 3.5 yuan. The factory's rock sugar was reopened for more than 200 bags, at 72.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Cannot Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market situation, Cheng Pan inherited the momentum of the previous day's market turning upward, and once reached its goal. However, actual sales were limited, and futures sales were especially strong, causing people's expectations to weaken. As a result, it fell instead of rising. Dayou factory oil was 200 dan, priced at 87 to 86 yuan 7 jiao and a half. Dalian oil was 130 barrels, priced at 112 to 112 yuan and a half, then to 112 yuan 2 jiao and a half. March upper delivery was 200 barrels, priced at 113 to 113 yuan and a half, then to 13 yuan. March lower delivery was 250 barrels, priced at 114 to 14 yuan 2 jiao and a half, then to 113 yuan 5 jiao. April upper delivery was 120 barrels, priced at 115 yuan 2 jiao and a half, and Yantai canned raw oil was 200 cans, priced at 129 yuan. Soybean cake seemed to have the same upward momentum as soybean oil, but it also fell back after entering. In the end, there were only a few points of fluctuation. 40,000 pieces of various brands of futures cake were traded. Shantou help bought 3,000 pieces of Dayou brand spot cake, and inland areas sent Yuanlong cake by carriage.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquettes Unified Factory Prices</h3>
<p>——Improve Quality and Restore Original Price——</p>
<p>The price of coal briquettes, previously due to the establishment of a new factory and competition among peers, had fallen to 160 yuan in after-hours trading. Yesterday, after a meeting among peers, it was decided that instead of devaluing the price and reducing materials, it would be better to improve the quality and unify the factory prices, benefiting both users and factories. Therefore, it was decided to restore the original price from today. Large factory coal briquettes are 166 yuan per ton by carriage, and delivery is subject to additional carriage fees.

<h3>Far East Crisis Not Imminent, Shanghai Situation Gradually Calming Down; American Citizens Still Preparing to Evacuate; Garrison Troops Continue to Protect Interests; Western Newspapers Believe Panic Is Entirely Stirred Up by Speculators</h3>
<p>Recently, since Japan's southward ambitions have become increasingly active, the situation in the Pacific has suddenly become tense. The United States, in order to take preventive steps, has reiterated its advice to evacuate its citizens. The atmosphere is tense, with a sense of impending doom. However, judging from yesterday's developments, the situation is very calm, and there is no sense of tension as imagined. American citizens here are maintaining a good spirit and accepting the urgent warning issued again by Washington. However, some do not fully understand its meaning. Officials at the American Consulate in this city stated that they cannot explain to all "non-essential" American citizens the reasons for the State Department's second formal warning. However, there is no doubt that there must be a good reason for warning American citizens to return home. Consulate officials will continue to urge American citizens who do not absolutely need to stay here during this tense time to return home. However, it is not clear what kind of cooperation the Consulate can provide or what specific measures can be taken to promote the evacuation of American citizens. According to the Consulate's estimates, two-thirds to three-quarters of non-essential American citizens, approximately 1,300 people, have already started their journey back to the United States. There are still some American citizens who should also return home in principle.</p>
<p>Still Have Funds to Meet Emergency Needs</p>
<p>However, according to American law, the authorities cannot force people to leave the country. Fortunately, most American citizens are sincerely cooperating with the government in implementing its Far East policy. No more than 20 American citizens in Shanghai have used the government's special program to borrow money to cover the cost of returning home, which shows that very few American citizens lack the funds to make the trip. However, in spirit, the program to lend money for travel expenses is justified. The American authorities here still have funds available for use in emergencies.</p>
<p>American Ship Cabins Fully Booked</p>
<p>According to shipping company news, ships sailing to the United States are crowded with passengers. Some are evacuating American citizens, and others are ordinary passengers. First-class tickets on all ships are now booked until April. Ordinary-class tickets are booked at least four months in advance. The next ship sailing to the United States is the President Coolidge, leaving Shanghai on February 25th. Tickets have already been sold out.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Believes There is No Need to Evacuate</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that, according to the Allied Press, the newly appointed Japanese Army Spokesman in Shanghai, Major Akiyama, first received Western journalists in this city on the afternoon of the 15th. Reporters asked many questions. In his response, Akiyama ridiculed the news reports in foreign newspapers about the increasingly tense situation in the Pacific region. He claimed that he did not understand why American citizens were leaving China. The United States' repeated advice for its citizens to evacuate is quite strange. The Japanese hope that many American friends will remain in Shanghai. This hope also applies to citizens of all countries, not just American citizens. He and all Japanese people believe that Japan will "do its best to maintain peace to the end," he said. The observations of the Japanese Embassy and the Naval Spokesman are completely consistent with Akiyama. Although Akiyama acknowledged that the situation in the Far East is becoming more difficult, he emphasized that the situation in Shanghai has improved.</p>
<p>Naturalized Citizens Must Return to the United States by Deadline</p>
<p>An official at the American Consulate in this city stated on the morning of the 15th that American citizens here who apply for new passports from the Consulate must have their fingerprints taken. The practice of citizens having their fingerprints taken has been implemented in the United States for more than two years. Everyone, from the President down, has already had their fingerprints taken, he said. Regarding the recent rumor that Chinese who are "naturalized" as American citizens will lose their American citizenship if they do not return to the United States, an official at the American Consulate stated that, according to a current American law enacted in 1880, Orientals cannot become naturalized American citizens. However, foreigners can obtain "dual" citizenship, such as those who obtain American citizenship and return to their country of birth. However, such people must return to the United States within five years in order to maintain their citizenship. Orientals born in the United States who hold American passports must also return to the United States within five years according to law.</p>
<h3>Western Newspapers Analyze the Situation, Believing There is No Need to Panic</h3>
<p>Western newspapers analyze the situation, believing there is no need to panic. The Yulin Western News yesterday published an article entitled "Unreasonable Panic," detailing the recent terror that has occurred among people here. It stated that the panic that has occurred in Shanghai in the past few days has been caused by two types of people. The first type is alarmists, whose problem lies in not having a deep understanding of the facts and who often make alarmist statements. The other type is opportunists who take advantage of the public's ignorance and spread sensational rumors to reap the benefits. We do not deny the seriousness of the situation, but it has not yet reached the point where people are frightened. This can be proven by a telegram sent by Reuters in London. The telegram stated, "Well-informed Allied sources in London feel that there is no immediate crisis at present." Hitler is trying his best to get Japan to join the war to divert Britain's attention in Africa. However, he has not been able to get Japan and the Soviet Union to conclude a non-aggression treaty, and before Japan can have no worries about its rear, Japan will not act rashly to the south. Therefore, before the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, the situation in the Far East does not seem to be turning sharply downward, and there is no need to panic. Unfortunately, Shanghai is an international city that cannot strictly punish those who create rumors, and even more unfortunately, there are such unlawful people who take the opportunity to spread rumors in order to enrich their own pockets. Even if war breaks out in the Pacific Ocean, we should not be as panicked as we have been in the past two days. Therefore, for the benefit of the entire society, we should have clear intelligence and a calm mind, and resolve not to be misled by unfounded rumors, but to observe the truth of the facts calmly.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Not Easily Give Up Its Interests in the Far East</h3>
<p>Since the American Consulate reiterated its advice to evacuate its citizens, the Japanese side has also greatly promoted the idea that the United States will withdraw its garrison troops from Shanghai. According to the Daily News published yesterday morning, the American Marine Corps barracks are already packing up scattered items and sorting out various military weapons, moving them into warehouses. Therefore, the withdrawal of American troops stationed in Shanghai is only a matter of time, and it is expected to be implemented by the end of April at the latest. However, the British side is very panicked, so it is currently negotiating with the United States to ask them not to implement this plan in order to maintain the security of the concession. However, this issue must wait until General Hurd arrives in Shanghai before it can be decided, and so on. When the reporter inquired with American officials about whether the above statements were true, it was said that this statement was completely unfounded. The State Department's reiteration of its advice to evacuate citizens this time is entirely due to the recent unpredictable situation in the Far East. Therefore, for the safety of its citizens, it has to take this preventive step. As for the withdrawal of the garrison troops, it has never been considered. The United States has great interests in Shanghai and will not easily give them up.</p>
<h3>Under the Oppression of Life, Labor Strikes Occur Frequently: Commodity Prices Remain High and Multiple Strikes Erupt Again</h3>
<p>To suppress commodity prices, the two concessions have been proceeding swiftly. However, as the recent price surge has not subsided, employees in various industries are mostly finding it impossible to make ends meet. Those who have not received salary or allowance increases are finding it even harder to maintain their livelihoods. They are requesting employers to improve their treatment, and the authorities are paying close attention and mediating. Employers are also trying their best to find solutions to achieve satisfactory resolutions. It is reported that several strike events have erupted again, which are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Barber Strike Still Not Contained</p>
<p>The labor dispute at barber shops, which was resolved on January 21 with the signing of a contract to resume work, has yet to be implemented after a month. This has led to dissatisfaction among barbers, resulting in unfortunate events such as strikes. The dispute at barber shops like White Rose in the French Concession has not been fully resolved as of yesterday. Yesterday, similar unfortunate incidents, such as strikes, occurred again at Class B barber shops on Guangxi Road, Zhoujin Lane, etc. Relevant parties are now trying to mediate and strongly urge employers to fulfill the contract. At a barber shop located at 831 Medhurst Road, around noon yesterday, several outside striking barbers suddenly arrived and forced the shop's workers to join the strike, leading to a quarrel with the owner. Words escalated into physical violence, resulting in the owner being injured in the head and bleeding profusely. After someone called the police, the assaulting barbers were apprehended on the spot and taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Box-Making Strike Expected to Be Resolved</p>
<p>There are over 500 box-making businesses in this city. The "Union" of this industry requested a 50% wage increase from employers last month. During the first negotiation, both labor and management agreed to a 30% increase based on the original salary. In the second negotiation, the labor side suddenly demanded a doubling of wages, which the employers found unacceptable due to the excessive demand. They agreed to convene a general meeting of members for a decision and response. On the 4th of this month, the industry association held a general meeting of members, and it was unanimously decided to voluntarily increase wages. The industry association reported this to the "Union," but the "Union" considered it unsatisfactory. On the 12th of this month, over 5,000 box-making workers across the city went on strike, which has lasted for four days. During this strike period, over ten factories have been vandalized, and countless paper boxes have been torn. The representatives of labor and management held negotiations at the Jinchang Box Factory the day before yesterday, and the results were quite close. Negotiations continued yesterday, and it is expected that the labor dispute in this industry will be resolved satisfactorily soon.</p>
<p>Leather Goods Dispute Being Mediated by Authorities</p>
<p>Over 2,400 workers employed in various leather goods manufacturing factories in the city, who produce leather suitcases and trunks, jointly submitted a request to the factory owners through their representatives, asking for improved treatment and increased cost-of-living allowances. As the factory owners did not approve their requests, this led to dissatisfaction among all the workers, who jointly declared a strike starting yesterday. It is learned that in order to seek a resolution to this unnecessary dispute, the labor side has requested the political department of the concession authorities to mediate. The authorities will convene a meeting of representatives from both labor and management tomorrow to hold talks.</p>
<p>The Actual Situation of the U.S. Allied Industry Strike</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Allied Industrial Corporation, the workers dismissed on December 31st of last year had previously violated factory regulations. It was not a case of dismissing worker representatives without cause. Regarding the original text of their demands for improved treatment, item (2) states "Increase the cost-of-living allowance for both male and female workers by 40 cents per day, which, combined with the original amount, should be changed to 80 cents per day," and item (3) states "Increase rice rations by two dou per month, which, combined with the original three dou, should provide each person with five dou per month, uniformly for both male and female workers, calculated at the original price of 14 yuan per shi." This differs slightly from the reports in various newspapers. Furthermore, the workers occupying the factory and refusing to leave day and night has led the company to carefully request the police to temporarily disperse them. As for the claim that the company has newly hired a batch of workers who have completed a portion of the work, that is also not true. This statement is provided by letter.</p>
<p>Typesetting Workers Request Wage Increase</p>
<p>The affairs of thirty to forty small newspapers in Shanghai are mostly outsourced to printing shops. Among the printing shops that print newspapers are Dasen, Huadong, Jiangnan, Dongnan, Xinxin, and Liguo, with approximately 250 typesetting workers. Because the cost of living is rising, the original wages are insufficient to maintain a livelihood. The workers organized a Newspaper Workers' Mutual Aid Association and held a general meeting the day before yesterday, where the following resolutions were passed: (1) The standard for "paihuan" (typesetting and returning type) is 3,000 characters. (2) Increase the original salary of 40 yuan to 60 yuan, 45 yuan to 63 yuan, 50 yuan to 65 yuan, 55 yuan to 66 yuan, and 60 yuan to 69 yuan. (3) New members joining the Newspaper Workers' Mutual Aid Association will be paid 65 yuan. (4) Hiring of workers will be coordinated by the association. (If the work standard exceeds the above, the standard calculation will be based on increasing 50 yuan to 65 yuan.) The above measures have been communicated to employers and newspaper offices, requesting implementation starting today (February 16).</p>
<h3>Rice is Still Being Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, yesterday (the 14th), there were rumors that Dutch ships might cease operating in Chinese waters, causing considerable unease in the local rice market. However, business circles stated that the situation has not reached a critical stage, as a large amount of rice will soon be shipped from Vietnam and Burma to Shanghai. The ship Yinlute, carrying about 24,000 bags of rice, and the Laohe, carrying 13,000 bags of rice, are coming from Vietnam and are both scheduled to arrive in port within the next two days. Well-informed sources claimed that the current rice stock in Shanghai is about one million bags. Even if sea routes are temporarily cut off, there is no fear of a grain shortage in this city. Yesterday, the committee responsible for stabilizing rice prices stated that the plan to resume price stabilization will soon be finalized, with many businesses donating funds to assist. Although the date for price stabilization has not been decided, it is very near.</p>

<h3>The Zibad Ship Temporarily Ordered to be Allowed to Unload Cargo in Shanghai, and Also Allowed to Load Export Goods to Return to Surabaya</h3>
<p>The Dutch ships sailing on the Far East route were ordered to suspend operations. Therefore, the Java Company mail ship Zibad, which arrived in Shanghai at around 6 PM the day before yesterday, originally planned to set sail and return south from Shanghai at 9 PM that night after the passengers disembarked. The cargo it brought, including 1,750 tons of sugar, 100 tons of rubber, and 3,300 tons of foreign rice and 400 tons of corn (i.e. pearl rice) loaded from Hong Kong, would all be transported back to Hong Kong for unloading. Before the ship arrived in port, the company had completed the export customs clearance procedures for the ship, waiting for the ship to depart after the passengers disembarked. The above situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>Loading Export</p>
<p>It is now known that the ship did not leave Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to the company's announcement yesterday, before the ship set sail the day before yesterday, it suddenly received notification from the head office that it was allowed to unload cargo in Shanghai and could also load export goods. Therefore, the ship berthed at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf yesterday and began unloading incoming goods. Around next Tuesday, it will load export goods and return to Surabaya via the original route, passing through Xiamen, Hong Kong, and various Nanyang ports. As for whether the Zhizhayunja and Royal Ship TegelBerg, which were ordered to dock in the Philippines and were scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th, will arrive on schedule, the company was unable to give a definitive answer yesterday when asked.</p>
<p>British Ship Responding to the Call</p>
<p>It is also known that the British Admiralty continues to requisition British ships in the Far East. It is reported that the Taikoo Company’s Beiyang class ship, the Shengjing, has been ordered to respond to the call and has now suspended operations and is undergoing repairs in the dock. Once the work is completed, it will sail to Singapore to await deployment. Several ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are also waiting in Shanghai to sail to Singapore.</p>
<p>American and French Cargo Ships Setting Sail for Shanghai</p>
<p>The American cargo ship Taivus, carrying 2,000 tons of goods destined for Shanghai, has already departed from Baltimore in the United States and will arrive in Shanghai via New York, Norfolk, Savannah, Panama, Manila, and Hong Kong. After unloading the goods, it will return to the United States and continue its voyage. In addition, the American ship President Coolidge will leave Shanghai on the 25th to return to the United States. Most of the cabins have already been reserved by American expatriates evacuating from Shanghai. The French ship Carreer will also arrive in Shanghai soon. It is reported that the ship is carrying over 4,700 tons of coal and departed from Hongji at around 4 PM yesterday to come to Shanghai. After the arrival of this coal, along with the abundant coal reserves in the city, there should be no fear of a coal shortage in the future.</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops in Wujiang Area Launch Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>According to a person from Kunshan, the Chen Yuezong regiment, which has launched guerrilla warfare in the Kunshan, Wujiang, Jiashan, and Qingpu areas, has seen its strength doubled after four years of continuous fighting. They have clashed with the Japanese army no less than a thousand times and have won the deep love of the people. The Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to retaliate against the Chen regiment, but all have failed. Recently, on the morning of the 4th of this month, more than 300 Japanese troops from Wujiang, Pingwang, Kunshan, Jiaozhi, Jiashan, Xitang, and other places, on three motorboats and more than ten civilian boats, led by a shallow-water small warship, encountered the Chen regiment at Zhujia Lake, northwest of Zhouzhuang Town, Wuxian County. The Chen regiment responded with the special service company and the fourth company of the first battalion. The two sides fought fiercely for eight hours. Although the number of Japanese troops was large, they ultimately failed. It is reported that the Japanese troops suffered many casualties in this battle. The Chen regiment also clashed with the Japanese army in the Dayi Township area of the sixth district of Wujiang County on the 6th, after the 4th. At that time, many Japanese troops were killed, and a large number of spoils of war such as machine guns, rifles, and ammunition were obtained.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Milk Stall Found and Sentenced</h3>
<p>Chen Axiao, the owner of a milk stall in Nanshi, was selling milk in the Public Concession without a license. After being discovered by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, he was prosecuted in court and sentenced to a fine of 40 yuan on the 12th of this month. Furthermore, the milk sold was found to be unsanitary, and he was sentenced to four months in prison by the court. If he paid a fine, it would be commuted to one day for every three yuan.</p>
<h3>Appealing for the New Pu Yu Tang Orphanage: An Urgent Need for Rescue</h3>
<p>In any place, especially in Shanghai, people living on the line of existence can be roughly divided into three phenomena: one is those who possess great wealth and have no worries; one is those who work hard to make a living; and one is those who are poor, lonely, and unable to survive. Although these current phenomena may change over time, some may see past riches become relics of the past, while others may see past deficiencies turn into surpluses. But in these difficult times, when we witness our poor and lonely compatriots suffering from hunger and cold, we should, with compassion and regret, do our best to rescue them. This is the humble intention behind the facts we are about to relate to appeal to readers. We are confident that readers will exert ten, a hundred, even a thousand times more than our strength, to expand this compassion, to care for the young and help those in need. This is something that anyone is happy to support.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the future masters of China, such lovely, lively, and clever angels, but they have suffered tragic fates since childhood. They are currently being cared for by the Shanghai New Pu Yu Tang Orphanage. As long as society continues to provide assistance to the orphanage, there will naturally be many more who need care. If people in society have not fulfilled their responsibility to help the weak and support the disadvantaged because they do not know the details, then we have failed in our duty to report. Our reporting today is also "doing our best."</p>
<p>"Compassion is in everyone's heart." "Everyone wants to do good; who is not like me?" There are many types of relief efforts, and those in need are everywhere, often causing those with good intentions and the ability to help to unintentionally overlook. This is certainly not a refusal to help but a feeling of inability to help. Therefore, we feel that it is best to engage in relief efforts, but also to make those who contribute money and effort understand the past achievements of the relief effort and the direction of future efforts, what the existing foundation is like, what the current situation is like, and what the future plans are like. This kind of donation with a plan will be welcomed by more people in society. Our appeal for donations for the New Pu Yu Tang Orphanage, which was founded thirty years ago, is based on this principle. Look! From this photo, we can see how many orphans have been cared for and are growing up in a garden with lush trees. How can we bear to let them worry about food and clothing? How can we bear to let them suffer setbacks again in their growth? And how can we bear to let other orphans be unable to obtain this kind of benevolent care?</p>
<p>The velvet clothes worn by all the children in the attached photo were donated by the Anle Textile Factory. We deeply admire their noble compassion, but we believe that there are still many others with the same compassion. Saving one more person is also contributing to society. We believe that the Anle Textile Factory's spirit of bravely doing good without seeking recognition should be commended. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Three Portuguese Nationals Accused of Running a Gambling Den: One of Them Also Operating an Opium Den; Portuguese Consulate to Conduct a Formal Hearing</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, as disclosed yesterday (the 14th), three Portuguese nationals are currently being questioned by the Portuguese Consulate General on charges of running a gambling den. One of the three, Pu Beidu, was arrested by the police on December 26 after a gambling den was busted in a public residence at 1477 Jing'an Temple Road. Another, Chai Weier, had opened a gambling den in the German-Italian Building.</p>
<p>Opening a Gambling Den</p>
<p>Another, Bo Tailuo, operated a luxurious gambling den upstairs in the Yindu Dance Palace at 982 Foch Road. In addition to running gambling dens, Pu Beidu and Bo Tailuo are also accused of privately setting up opium smoking rooms. Portuguese law imposes particularly heavy penalties for this crime. According to the Portuguese Consul General and Consular Judge Melo, if the three are found guilty of running a gambling den, the Consular Court has already sentenced them to suspended sentences and released them. However, if there are private opium utensils in the busted gambling den, then the</p>
<p>Punishment Methods</p>
<p>will be very different. The three offenders will be sentenced to several years in prison. Melo also said that the punishment of the offenders is particularly pitiful, as they are blindly used by the Chinese for a small price. All three offenders have been released on bail, with Pu Beidu's bail of 1,000 yuan being the highest. It is reported that the Public Concession Police Department began to crack down on all gambling dens and drug dens within the concession on December 26, busting the gambling den at 1477 Jing'an Temple Road, and subsequently arresting eight Chinese and Pu Beidu. The Chai Weier operated</p>
<p>German-Italian Building</p>
<p>The gambling den was busted on January 11, and many account books and other items were seized. The Bo Tailuo operated Yindu Dance Palace upstairs gambling den and opium smoking room were busted by the police on February 1. Also, according to the English-language China Press, Melo will formally open the trial of the three next week.</p>
<h3>Four Major Thieves' Crimes Confirmed: Police Prosecute According to Law</h3>
<p>Central Police Huang Hairu and others previously arrested four thieves, Wang Weilang, Li Bin, Yan Qi, and Wang Gensheng, on Ningbo Road. Two pistols and ten bullets were seized. After being interrogated and detained by the First Special Court, they were found to have committed multiple robberies and assaults. These include: (1) On August 29th of last year, an attempted robbery of 18,800 yuan in wages from the Shanghai Shipyard near the junction of Yangshupu Road and Sheng Road failed. A foreigner, Ai Haigen, was shot and injured while transporting the money. (2) On the 7th of last month, an attempted robbery of the Shanghai Stock Exchange at 42 Jiujiang Road failed. (3) On October 21st of the 29th year, the robbery of 18,180 yuan from Xu Rongfang's home at 11, Lane 96, Moore Road. (4) On July 13th of last year, the robbery of Lu's family property at 52 Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road. (5) The robbery of Chen Nailing's family property at 14, Lane 452, Macau Road. (6) The robbery of Gu Hou's gold and silver jewelry at 1463 Edinburgh Road. (7) The robbery of Chen Fengqi's family property at 540 Wuding Road. This morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. Judge Chuan Lin opened a criminal court for interrogation. After the police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them case by case, Judge Chuan ordered them to be detained for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Shooting at the Farlen Nightclub</h3>
<p>At around 0:15 AM this morning, while the Farlen Nightclub at 325 Columbia Road, at the intersection of Great Western Road, was filled with bright lights, wine, and a mix of men and women, tragedy struck. Suddenly, ten thugs, two of whom were armed with pistols, rushed into the building without asking questions, pulled out their pistols, and fired twenty to thirty shots, while also throwing two hand grenades. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled without a trace. There were more than twenty people injured on the spot, all of whom were Westerners. Among them, one male, a Westerner who worked as a dance host at the club, was seriously injured, while the rest suffered minor injuries. Afterwards, they all rushed to the hospital for treatment. The police authorities are currently investigating the incident thoroughly.</p>

<p>Jiang Song-sheng, a 38-year-old man from Jiangbei, resided at No. 331, Kangle Fang, Kangnao Tu Road, West Shanghai. He worked as a ticket seller for the tram company. Around 0:30 AM yesterday, Jiang was on the night shift. At home were his wife, also 38 years old, and their three sons. Because of the spring chill, they had placed a coal briquette stove in the bedroom to keep warm, resulting in coal gas filling the small room. His wife and three boys were all poisoned and unconscious. When Jiang returned home, he discovered that his wife and children were all on the verge of death. He immediately reported it to the police station, and they dispatched an ambulance to the scene, transporting them all to the Tongren Second Hospital on Bailinan Road. The eldest son, Zu-hong, age eight, and the second son, Zu-fu, age five, had already died by the time they reached the hospital.

<p>International Cup Football Replay: China vs. Portugal This Morning; 10:30 AM at Yiyuan Again; Donghua vs. St. Francis in the Preliminary Group</p>
<p>The International Cup football replay between China and Portugal will be held at Yiyuan again at 10:30 AM this morning after their match last Wednesday ended in a 3-3 draw. The referee will still be Kanar. The Chinese lineup was announced a few days ago, with slight changes from last week. Zhou Qilin has been transferred to Wanjin, and Han Long will fill Zhou Qilin’s position. However, whether Han will be able to play today is still uncertain. If he can play, it will strengthen the team's power and enable them to deal a head-on blow to Portugal. As for the Portuguese lineup, several veterans were unable to play last week, but today Fafan Xiao, Oliveira, and V. Su Ruo, among others, have recovered from their injuries and will take the field, making their strength even greater than last week. Therefore, the rematch between these two powerful teams will be a tense and exciting performance. In terms of the league, there will be one match in the preliminary group, two in Group B, and three in Group C today. Donghua vs. St. Francis in the preliminary group and Yizhong Yan vs. Zhendan in Group C will both be played at the Zhendan Stadium on Luban Road. Donghua has been invincible in the preparatory group and will surely defeat their opponent easily. Yizhong Yan has only lost once in Group C and has strong strength, so their chances of victory are also high. The other matches are all between Western teams. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<h3>威托寗得初級杯　華聯慘敗　昨決賽四比零</h3>
<p>Vito Nning Wins Junior Cup; China United Suffers Crushing Defeat; 4-0 in Yesterday's Final</p>
<p>In the Western Football Association Junior Cup final, China United played Vito Nning at Zhendan yesterday. Vito had defeated Montins, Ruomens, and Peidehui to advance to the final week. China United had a bye in the first week, then defeated the French Navy 3-0 in the second week, and then defeated Hezibao 2-1 to secure their place in the final, showing great momentum. However, they were completely defeated by Vito yesterday, losing by a large margin of 4-0. Vito got the first kickoff in yesterday's game. In the 15th minute, Vito's center forward, Kelini, scored a cold shot, hitting the bullseye, and Vito took the lead 1-0. At the end of the first half, China United repeatedly failed to score, and Vito failed to break through China United again. The first half ended at 1-0. After switching sides, China United's attack still did not improve. At 10 minutes, Kelini made it 2-0. Five minutes later, Kelini made a comeback and scored again, creating a one-sided situation. China United tried to retaliate, launching several attacks in succession, but all failed. At 35 minutes, Vito's left winger, Kanu, advanced quickly along the side and scored a long shot, making it 4-0. Three minutes later, China United had a penalty kick opportunity, but the kicker rushed too quickly and shot wide, easily missing a great opportunity. When the allotted time was up, Vito Nning defeated China United 4-0 and won this year's championship. The beautiful silver cup, which was held by the Youyou Association in the previous year, has once again fallen into the hands of Westerners. After the game, the Vice President of the Western Football Association and Honorary Football Committee Member of the China Referees Association, Ai Qi, personally presented the awards.

<h3>讀報有感</h3>
<p>Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper</p>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>In the newspapers of the 11th of this month, there was a news report from New York, roughly stating: "The Children's Division of the China Relief Committee will hold a singing concert at City Hall here in the near future, called "Singing for China." Only children can participate, and tickets can be purchased for one US dime or by donating milk powder, vitamin pills, and cod liver oil to be sent to China. The program will begin with Chinese children wearing their national costumes singing the Kuomintang party song, followed by other children singing folk songs from various countries."</p>
<p>After reading this news report, I wonder what thoughts you children may have? Children in faraway lands overseas have not forgotten their motherland for a moment. Shouldn't children stranded on the isolated island also have something to contribute? I know you will definitely answer me, no! So, how can you contribute your strength?</p>
<p>My little friends! You don't have many holidays during the school year. Take at least one day a week - choose a Sunday - and invite a few classmates or neighboring friends. We can also hold a singing concert. Those who participate can donate a little something according to their ability. Of course, money is the best if you can afford it. Everything is exactly the same as mentioned in this news report, except for the scale. You are a small gathering; at the end of the concert, tally up: How much money was donated? How many items were collected? Or the total amount collected is very small, but you must never underestimate these things. If the children of the entire city are willing to form such singing concerts, then the total amount gathered, I believe, will definitely exceed the results of that event in New York in the future. As for the program of the concert, it does not have to be limited to singing alone. Other things like harmonica, dancing, etc. can also be added. Also, regarding the venue, if you are limited by your family's status, you might as well ask the school authorities to lend you a place. You have noble motives, and the authorities will surely agree. At this time, you can even expand the scale to be based on one grade or even one school!</p>
<p>Dear children! I hope that everyone can quickly initiate this kind of interesting and meaningful gathering. The children of Shanghai will definitely not let the Chinese children of New York take all the credit!</p>
<h3>支配時間</h3>
<p>Managing Time</p>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Whenever we have exams, we often see some classmates who are very free, and their grades are mostly very good. Some classmates are studying hard from early morning to late night, but their grades are not necessarily good. What is the reason for this? It is not that those classmates are particularly smart. Apart from the fact that they have effective study methods, the most important thing is that they know how to manage their time. They have time to study every day, so they can be calm and composed during exams.</p>
<p>Many children don't know how to manage their time. They either play too much or study too much. This is inappropriate and harmful for children who are growing up. You need to know why schools have subjects such as physical education, music, and crafts in addition to textbooks. It is to develop children's bodies and minds in all aspects and to obtain reasonable development so that they can take on all major tasks in the future. However, a few hours of training in school is not enough. We also need to have a disciplined life in our spare time or during holidays. Without the supervision of teachers or the help of classmates, we must manage and supervise ourselves, doing repairing work. This disciplined life is not so rigid, using bells to divide the subjects, but it must also have a comprehensive plan to allocate time: when to concentrate on studying, when to enjoy sports or games, when to rest your body, when to help with household chores, and complete the day's work in an orderly manner every day.</p>
<p>If we can complete our daily work, have appropriate games and sports, and also have adequate rest, then we no longer have to worry about poor grades or working in vain. Children, go and try it!</p>
<h3>做蠟像</h3>
<p>Making Wax Figures</p>
<p>— Luo Pan</p>
<p>The older brother was reading a book, and the younger brother ran over with a mournful face, half running and half jumping, holding half of a plaster mold in each hand. He shouted, "Brother! The plaster mold is broken!"</p>
<p>"How did you break it?" the older brother asked, looking up.</p>
<p>"I saw classmates bringing a lot of wax toys to school, like Snow White, dwarfs, fish, and all kinds of colorful things. They said they bought plaster molds and made them themselves, so I also went to buy a plaster mold, but it broke as soon as I made it. The wax is all stuck on the mold."</p>
<p>"Did you ask them how to do it?"</p>
<p>"No!" The younger brother realized that he was too careless. Too careless.</p>
<p>"When making wax figures, you must first soak the inside of the mold in some water to prevent the wax from sticking. Then pour the melted wax into the mold and quickly cover the other half of the mold. Shake it around in all directions so that the wax can be evenly distributed on every part of the mold. After shaking it, wait for a while for the wax to solidify. Then soak the mold in water and gently pull it open. The wax figure will float out. After taking it out, you still have to do some repair work to remove the bad parts, and then a beautiful wax figure is complete." The older brother paused, then continued,</p>
<p>"When we make them, we can melt waxes of various colors together to create beautiful and pleasing colors. If you make them wrong, you can melt them and make them again, so wax figures are indeed economical and beautiful toys. As for your mold, you can put it on the fire and slowly melt the wax on it, just be careful not to smoke the mold black again."</p>
<p>The younger brother agreed and hurried out to buy a mold.</p>
<h3>四隻變八隻鴿子的故事</h3>
<p>The Story of Four Pigeons Becoming Eight</p>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>Qiu'er originally kept a pair of pigeons at home. Since the mother pigeon hatched two baby pigeons last month, there are now four pigeons. It was one afternoon last Sunday when Qiu'er had just returned home from a classmate's house. His mother said to him with a smile, "Qiu'er, do you know that we had a news event at home today?" Qiu'er, hearing this, couldn't remember what the news was for a moment and hurriedly asked his mother, "What's the news?" His mother said to him, "After lunch today, when I went up to the drying terrace to feed the pigeons, I suddenly saw eight pigeons perched on the drying terrace. Upon closer inspection, four of them were our own, and the other four had been brought in by them from elsewhere. Don't you think this is news?" Qiu'er, hearing this, was so happy that he danced with joy and hurriedly walked to the drying terrace to take a look. Sure enough, there were four more. They were preening their feathers under the eaves next to the pigeon loft, and two of them were golden in color, making them even more beautiful and lovely. This made Qiu'er extremely happy! He couldn't help but say to himself, "Happy! Happy!"</p>
<p>At this time, Qiu'er's father was returning home from the company. Hearing Qiu'er talking to himself upstairs, he called him down and asked him what was going on. Qiu'er said, "We keep four pigeons at home, and today they have turned into eight. My mother said that they brought them in from elsewhere, so I am very happy." His father, hearing this, also showed a smile on his face and said to Qiu'er, "Pigeons are a type of bird that likes to be in groups the most, so pigeons from elsewhere will fly back with our pigeons. They fly extremely fast and have the strongest memories; if you put them in a farther place, they will fly back to their original place in a while, so pigeons were often used to deliver messages in the army in the past, called homing pigeons; but now that science is developed, there are wireless telegrams available for transmitting rapid messages, so homing pigeons are no longer used in the army!"</p>
<h3>幸福人的襯衫</h3>
<p>The Shirt of a Happy Man</p>
<p>— Lan Ye</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a king who was very seriously ill. Many famous doctors treated him, but none were effective. The king was very depressed while lying in bed, so he issued a notice saying:</p>
<p>"Whoever can cure my illness, I will give him half of my territory. I will never go back on my word. This is the notice."</p>
<p>As a result, he summoned many learned people, but none of them could cure the king's illness. Later, a physician, after long study, said: "If someone can find a contented and happy man and take off the shirt he is wearing and give it to the king to wear, then the king's illness will immediately be driven away."</p>
<p>So the king ordered many messengers to go in different directions to find this happy man. But the messengers, after receiving this order, tried their best to go everywhere to search, but they could not find him. Because wealthy people are not healthy, and healthy people are poor. As for the middle class, they also have their flaws. Either they envy the rich or they look down on the poor. So, searching here and there, they could not find the happy man the physician was talking about.</p>
<p>One night in early winter, the dark sky had no stars or moon, and the cold wind was blowing, piercingly cold. Everything around was as silent as death, without a sound, except for a song that flew from a dilapidated thatched hut:</p>
<p>"Ah! Let your sweat flow as you eat bread! This is how I can sleep peacefully! This is the most wonderful life!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the prince happened to be passing by and was extraordinarily happy to hear this song. "Ah! What a good lesson this is! Tonight, I have found a contented and happy man. Take his shirt and give it to my seriously ill father to wear, then his illness will be cured. Ah! How fortunate I am!"</p>
<p>The prince hurriedly returned to the palace and immediately sent a messenger to the happy man to retrieve his shirt; the messenger took money and ran to that place as if flying.</p>
<p>But the happy man was so poor that he didn't even have a shirt.</p>
<h3>小玩意</h3>
<p>Small Gadgets</p>
<p>— Hou Lin</p>
<p>— Square Eggs —</p>
<p>Children! When you see this name, you must be very surprised! In fact, it is just an ordinary egg that has been slightly modified. The method of making it is very easy. Just put a whole egg in vinegar. After ten days, take the egg out. At this time, the eggshell has become soft. Then put it into a square mold. After another three or four days, the eggshell will gradually harden. So, a square egg is made.</p>
<p>Children! When the eggshell becomes soft, if you have other favorite molds, you may put it in. After three or four days, it will turn into your favorite thing.</p>

<h3>Li Qinian and Chen Yunshang: Their Meeting at the Public Banquet of the "Shanghai Film Friends"</h3>
<p>— Nanjiang</p>
<p>One, the "Darlings of Heaven" Chen Yunshang, and the other, the "Southern Queen of Film" Li Qinian, came from Hong Kong to the embrace of China's Hollywood and ultimately gained a lofty position in the Shanghai film industry today.</p>
<p>Beautiful stories have constantly been passed into the ears of movie fans about these two radiant artists, but no one has heard of them having even a chance encounter in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the Golden Hall, on the ninth floor of the longevity hall, many dazzling superstars were found, including "Little Bird" Chen Yanyan, "Little Sister" Li Minghui, and Tong Yuejuan, Li Hong, Hong Wei, Xia Fang, etc., all dressed in盛妝盛妝, and film industry figures such as Yan Chuntang, Zhang Shankun, Liu Zhongliang, and Li Zulai were also present.</p>
<p>This was the Golden Gate public banquet for the thirtieth birthday of Yu Xiangqin of the "Shanghai Film Friends" and his wife Wu Lianying, and this was the second time Li Qinian and Chen Yunshang had met.</p>
<p>Just like at the engagement banquet of Yu Guang and Li Hong at the Paramount, Li Qinian and Chen Yunshang exchanged淡然淡然 smiles and slight nods upon meeting. Li Qinian was surrounded by a large group of stars, and Chen Yunshang naturally sat at the table with her sworn sisters. Due to the intertwined gazes and the constraints of self-esteem, their freedom was limited, and silence was warning them.</p>
<p>When Shi Wang conducted the harmonica club members in a performance of a birthday song, all the guests sang along. At this time, Chen Qinian and Chen Yunshang also stood up together, letting the singing echo.</p>
<p>When Shi Hailun performed a solo piano piece called "Invitation to Dance," Chen smiled at her mother, and Li listened quietly and respectfully. Music was a particular passion for them, but Li's secretary, Chen Fengming, was exceptionally far away this time.</p>
<p>The meeting between the two major stars lasted exactly two and a half hours.</p>
<p>On the way back, I couldn't help but think to myself,</p>
<p>"Idols are ultimately deceived by their creators, because idols themselves have lost their freedom, lost themselves, and are left with only loneliness and寂寞寂寞."</p>
<h3>Father and Son Face Off: Gai Jiaotian to Join the Golden Theater</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian, the master of short-play martial arts, came to Shanghai after the war to seek refuge and has been living as a recluse ever since. He performs only once or twice a year. Last year, following Tan Fuying, he performed for thirteen days at the New Stage, and the results were not bad. This old man is ambitious and intends to make a comeback with a long-term engagement, and he wants to cooperate with his sons Yi Peng, Yu Peng, and Guan Fu, etc. At the end of last year, he had several negotiations with the New Stage, but they were unsuccessful, because Yi Peng had also reached the position of taking on major roles.</p>
<p>The New Stage abandoned its plan to invite a plain actor and hired Zhang Yi Peng to perform new plays, while the Golden Grand Theater, due to the increased pay of plain actors, also plans to switch to new plays. However, the only talent in Shanghai who can take on the leading role is Gai Jiaotian. It is said that the two sides have already started negotiations. Gai Jiaotian is eager to make a comeback in order to compete with his son, so it is likely to happen. If it becomes a reality, it would be interesting to see father and son facing off against each other.</p>

Recently, David has applied to the British military department, and as soon as the permission is granted, he will temporarily leave the military and return to the limelight to star in a film for a British-American film company in England, directed by the famous Hollywood director Leslie Fenton, who is currently in England. The film is titled "Bombardier Squadron", and the female lead is David's charming wife, Ann Dvorak.</p>
<p>As the name "Bombardier Squadron" suggests, it is based on the bomber squadrons of the British Air Force, depicting their heroic deeds of attacking the enemy and defending the territory, but this "Bombardier Squadron" is not simply a propaganda film.</p>
<h3>"The Soviet Union Today"</h3>
<p>Three or four years ago, a film called "The Soviet Union Today" was released, but it has become outdated. The film "The Soviet Union Today", which will soon be released at the Dumei, is entirely composed of the latest Soviet newsreels, reflecting the overall picture of the Soviet Union through glimpses of various aspects of Soviet life. The content includes people's lives, urban and rural construction, healthcare, artistic activities, armed forces, etc. Among them, the healthcare reel is the most interesting, reflecting in detail how the Soviet government cares for every citizen's birth, old age, illness, and death.</p>

<h3>Lineup of the Liuxiang Society</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Xun Huisheng, the owner of Xiaoliuxiang Pavilion, the Liuxiang Society (formerly known as Qingsheng Society) is scheduled to come to Shanghai in mid-next month to perform at the Golden Theater. The lineup of the Liuxiang Society is slightly different from that of the Qingsheng Society era. The list of personnel going south this time is as follows:</p>
<p>Lead Actor: Xun Huisheng</p>
<p>Old Man: Wang Wenyuan</p>
<p>Martial Arts Actor: Wu Yanheng</p>
<p>Young Man: Xu Hecai</p>
<p>Clown: Zhu Binxian, Wang Duoshou</p>
<p>Supporting Old Men: Chen Xixing, Cao Lianxiao</p>
<p>Painted Face: Jiang Shaojin</p>
<p>Flower Dan: He Peihua</p>
<p>Old Woman: Sun Futing</p>
<p>Among the above people, martial arts actor Wu Yanheng, old woman Sun Futing, and clown Zhu Binxian all came south last year and are well known to the people of Shanghai, so there is no need to introduce them further. The other old man, Wang Wenyuan, originally named Wu Lingtong, was a disciple of Gao Cunsheng of the Binqing Society. After Yang Baosen and Huisheng separated, Wenyuan cooperated with Huisheng, so they are also old partners. Therefore, although the Golden Theater had the intention of inviting other old men for Huisheng's southern trip, they ultimately did not change him because Wenyuan had been with Huisheng for a long time. The young man Xu Hecai is a graduate of the Beijing Opera School. Among the young men from the opera school who have come south successively, there are Li Debin and Chu Jinpeng, but Xu Hecai's skills are even better than these two. The clown Wang Duoshou is a brother of Jia Duocai. Although he is a second-tier role, he has a lot of experience. Chen Xixing and Cao Lianxiao were the earliest old men to emerge from the Fuliancheng Opera School and are now both in supporting roles. Xixing has a voice and can sing, specializing in the style of Shi Zhinong. Chen is proficient in Shi's masterpieces "Ma'anshan" and "Shang Tiantai". Painted Face Jiang Shao Kui is the brother-in-law of the famous淨侯喜瑞侯喜瑞. His drama style is based on 喜瑞喜瑞, and he is an outstanding figure after Hao Hou, alongside Ma Liankun. Flower Dan He Peihua was affiliated with the Zhabei New Stage for a long time in her early years. People in Shanghai may still remember her. She was also a popular actress in the past. Looking at the above lineup, it can be said to be quite complete. Furthermore, it is learned that the Golden Theater sent a telegram to Beijing yesterday, firmly inviting the famous clown Ma Fulu to come along. With Furong Cao in Shanghai, the two are originally Huisheng's right and left hands. This time, working with Huisheng, the Liuxiang Society is like adding wings to a tiger, and the performances are expected to be even more精彩精彩.</p>
