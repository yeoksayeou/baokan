<h3 id="c9">恐慌高潮中之民食 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>近兩月餘以來之米市，橫破限價，貼價飛騰，就小絞米言，最高曾見每百包四千三四百元之貼價，以是人心惶恐，粒食維艱，輿論沸揚，民情怨憤。前日乃由工部局董事會會議之結果，謂不日當有安定米市之辦法發表，此在市民固無日不翹企以待，若大旱之望雲霓者，蓋已久矣。原此次米價上漲之最大原因，即爲太平洋之風雲愈緊張，囤米者之居奇愈貪狠；此所牽涉者，有船隻問題，運費問題，執照問題，凡百枝節皆成藉口。蓋彼輩以爲戰局延擴之日，必致海運絕，糧路斷，整個上海有絕糧之可能，於是有米皆珠，無糧不貴；至斯時也，惟我獨有，扶搖直上之價格，誰敢訾議，誰爲限制，暴利所獲，寗止倍稱。此其所以在目前，寗可受各方之唾駡，不念糧食恐慌固眞有此一日，囤戶之米尙得任其操縱自如，不爲徵發，此實不思之甚也。</p>
<p>米市紊亂至於今日之地步，非好爲苛　之論，怠於作爲，不以民食爲重，固亦有以致之。蓋事不宜偏聽，未能審愼於始，而顧忌於後，於是衆議龐雜，意志徬徨，一事不可爲矣。且以糧食問題內涵之複雜，時局變幻之莫測，非有專司負責籌畫策略之機關，早作未雨綢繆之計。掌有權宜應變之權，則鮮克有濟者。顧乃不此之圖，此所以糧市劇烈變動之來，應付每感棘手，行動未能切實，徒以監視市塲，評定限價謂足以褫奸商之胆，收安定之效，是亦計左矣。已往之事，無庸追論，惟於糧市之前途，尙有不能已於言者。</p>
<p>（一）上海租界本有其國際性，故世界事變無論動盪至如伺地步，上海之地位，若得仍以國際間之合作，保持其原有之地位，固各國商人之利。不然，社會杌隉不安愈甚，切膚之痛固爲最大多數之中國人身受之，而治安日見阽危，各國商人尙得安居樂業乎？此可見休戚利害，固各國僑商與中國人民共之。欲維持上海局勢之安寧，就經濟言，先去其足以危及治安者，莫若平準糧價，而後人各安其業，遂其生，則各國經商盡利矣。故關於上海糧食，如何接濟，如何積儲，如何調節，如何平準，此不僅兩租界當局有此責任，即各國僑商縱不直接担當調節民食之艱巨，亦當爲善意之協助，庶幾上海民食問題不致更趨嚴重也。</p>
<p>（二）米商囤戶所以振振有詞者，（甲）日軍南進將爲此後米糧到源唯一之障礙；（乙）裝運船隻缺乏，即有定米，亦不能獲得艙位：（丙）運費增加，而使成本加重，無法低减。（丁）西貢有米，大部分在日人把持之下，不易搬運；（戊）香港仰光之米，又往往以採運證不易領取，致影響到源。然此五者如得各國僑商共同合作，固亦不難解決。蓋日本果南進而發生戰事，本無與於上海，良以上海國際關係之複雜，遠甚於今後可能參戰之國家，故其本質既不因若干國家之態度而變化，亦即得始終保持之於局外。倘非國際混亂至於公法蕩然，則無有一國得封鎖上海，故屆時而有專司運糧之輪隻，當不致遭受攔截阻撓。一切錯綜之甚，上海則在夾縫之中；孰謀毀之，自屬易如反掌；共謀保全，則其間機運固微妙而繁多也。</p>
<p>（三）則市塲管理，宜屏除舊時之放任，而爲有組織有方法之事實上管理。現行限價之辦法，限價之最易發生暗盤；一有暗盤，則限價失其效；限一次，高一次，常得相反之結果。若取公開評價，宜無此弊。其無如目前所評者仍爲限價，故三日一評，五日一議，未能適應商情之變遷，烏足以見平準市價之宏效。蓋市價變動不盡，上下無常，有利則販，無利則已，此其恒情也。乃欲以刻畫之限價，齊無定之行市，此非限價之不爲效，是實誤用限價之過也。故公開評價所願爲者，與其有無法控制之暗盤貼價，不如視市塲供求情形，議定行盤，自由升降。應高則高，高非爲操縱居奇所致；應低則低，低不爲故意壓抑之故。庶幾商人無所藉口，而市面不至失常。其所以必由負責機關，遴派專員，躬蒞市塲，眼同開價，不全委諸商人公議者，正爲商人只重私利，罔顧公益，惟有共同評價，乃可去其泰甚，糾其不法，商塲之情况既明，取締與矯正較易。今乃以視同一般公務處理之，未採直接有效之行動，宜如治絲之益紊矣。</p>
<p>（四）若取公開評價，則到貨存貨消貨之盈虛消長，市况上下，必有可靠之調查登記，以資運用。蓋欲策民食之安全，在未能公買公賣之制度前，只有就各方利益兼顧之原則下，不爲已甚，不使放縱，無碍於民食接濟，無妨於稗販利潤，更不致有操縱居奇之事實發生，是固民食行政上最重要之技術問題，運用之者存乎其人，非盡立法課程所能衡功也。</p>

<h3 id="c42">國際軼事（十）（一）　日本南進的趨勢 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>美國艦隊分訪紐西蘭與澳洲的舉動，已使南太平洋的形勢爲之一變，這將紐約泰晤十報駐東京訪員關於日本南進政策的無綫電報吿譯錄於俊：</p>
<p>德國所謂「生存空間」，在日本却叫做「共榮團」。</p>
<p>日本所謂「大東亞」者，乃是以日本，中國和「滿洲國一組成不可分解的核心，所以東京爲其中心點，叫周環繞着許多屬國和島嶼，作成一個「太陽系」。像這樣的東西，與其稱爲現代的產物，母寗認爲封建的「遺老」，等於一國君主居中，四周都是藩屬，歲時朝貢，以答上邦保護之恩，可是這種保護，却不問人家是吾需要而一體給與。</p>
<p>日本政治家於說明大東亞政策時，總注重經濟利益，如前仟外相有田，步武一般有名的「烏托邦」主義者，昌言將世界重行劃分做幾個軍事經濟力量相等的里位，即可獲得永久和平。</p>
<p>尙有其他「先知」，却看到另外的利益，如日海軍少將石丸曾謂日本因此可獲得重要的戰略地位，而使小國有金湯之固。</p>
<p>—年以來空軍力量的發展，已使日本散佈在太平洋中的二千五白個小島，或爲一隊固定的航空母艦，吏日本勢力伸入太平洋中，橫梗於美國和菲律濱之間，且離開夏威夷的珍珠港更接近了二千哩。這許多島嶼嘗被稱做到荷屬東印度去的踏脚石。實際在航空時代，飛艇可在牠們的礁湖中停泊，確是一個立脚點，而以上述各島做根據地的空軍與日本軍艦合作，將使英華聯合艦隊感到棘手。</p>
<p>這許多島嶼在經濟上殊少價値，然在日本管理之下，却也並不虧本。若就戰略上講，牠們環繞熱帶中去產豐當的島嶼，作成一道不能穿過的屏障，（這些熱帶島嶼上所產的橡膠，油，錫，鎳，可使日本成一軍備自給的國家），牠們的地位，適又橫斷美國艦隊達到這些出產豐富的島嶼和亞洲大陸的主要路綫，所以在日本軍事計劃中允佔重要。</p>
<p>據日海軍前總司令末决大將說，一個艦隊若以美國領土作根據地，祗有三條路錢可以接近日本。其中最利於作戰的一條是經由舊金山，夏威夷，中途島，關島和菲律濱。可是日本在這一條路綫上已有堅强的防禦，任何艦隊走　路綫，必不免自投羅網。</p>
<p>從阿拉斯加經阿留申羣島的北路，則因多霧之故，不能大規模使用，所以末决大將相信，美國艦隊的戰略，必將採取經由夏威夷，澳洲和英國大海軍根據地新加坡的南路。</p>
<p>新加坡是全局的鎖鑰，也是日本最近戰略行動的目標所在。牠位於南洋的外緣，離東京二千八百九十哩，相距遼遠，不啻直布羅陀之與紐約，但對於日本的甫進政策，仍不免爲軍事上的嚴重障礙。新加坡控制歐洲與遠東間一切運輸的咽喉，與荷屬東印度近在咫尺，離馬尼拉亦不過一千五百五十哩，且爲澳洲，紐西蘭和不列顚帝國間的交通樞紐。</p>
<p>無論何國，只要佔有新加坡，即能把握其　部交通，與絕對控制荷屬東印度。</p>
<p>英國在十五年　來，已將新加坡的防務大爲增强。新加坡已能容納最大的戰艦，並可作爲空軍根據地，總司令爲一空軍將官，現有大軍歸其指揮。新加坡在海上固若金湯，唯陸路上有被敵軍自馬來半島進襲的危險，可是牠最大的威脅係在空襲方面。</p>
<p>日本距新加坡最近的根據地，一向都遠在二千哩外。惟該國海軍近來已兩次向南躡進。一九三九年春，日本佔領了中國最南的領土海南島，後來日本政府又宣佈位於南海交通要道向無人管的史柏脫萊珊瑚礁，此　將受臺灣當局管轄，臺灣總督是日本現役的海軍大將。</p>
<p>海南是一個大島，可容大軍集中。史柏脫萊羣島是地球上素不知名的區域，係由九十六個小島組成，僅露出在海面之上。島中出產有龜鼈，鳥　鯊魚之屬。</p>
<p>凡航行南海的船隻，都視這一羣珊瑚礁爲畏途，可是日本海軍已詳加探測，日本船隻亦能通行無阻，且在礁湖中躱避風暴。此島旣入掌握，遂為日本海軍南　的前哨，離日本的二千五百哩，離新加坡祇有八百哩。</p>
<p>但這許多收獲比之法國的屈服，殊覺渺不足道。越南東南海岸的康蘭灣是一個重要的天然良港。日本軍艦所開到的西貢，距離新加坡僅有七百五十哩。日本以壓力加諸越南，一方面固爲對華戰事的急迫，一方面亦是南進中的一部份。</p>
<p>在這地帶內，如欲藉武力以變更現狀，祗有新加坡是軍事上一大障碍。現在進攻新加坡的各點，比絞援助新加坡的各點，已日見迫近了。新加坡在西太平洋中，乃是唯一可以容納龐大艦隊的根據地。</p>
<p>英國海軍問題專家貝箠晚曾將全部局勢概括的說：「日本若　決心與英國開戰，必將突然以全力攻擊新加坡，這强固的保壘一旦陷落，就可以勝算在握了。攻取新加坡，比之侵略澳洲，當然是一件更簡單的工作嗎。」</p>

<p>法商電車公司四百餘工人、自於木月十九日聯合罷工後、截至昨晚發稿時止、尙未聞諸解決消息、又悉該公司水電工人亦於昨日上午十時起加入罷工、故局勢頗趨嚴重、英商上海電車公司工人所提十二條件、公司考慮後、昨日下午四時一度談判、茲分誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>法電調處　可望解決</p>
<p>法商電車公司全體工人、於十九日起聯台罷工後、法租界政治部等曾勸吿工人先行復工、靜待合理之調處解決、並派員於昨日午後與公司大班磋商解決辦法、關於四項條件、公司允予考慮、惟對第三條停職工人復職一節、資方認爲殊難出爾反爾、故未允考慮、政事部因勞資雖未融洽、但已接近多多、故現正竭其全力以謀即速解決、微聞昨日上午十時許、勞方又在南市召開全體大會、討論應付辦法、內容不詳、但據昨日傍晚社聞社所得消息、則謂法電勞資談判、已更進一步、同時某方將以壓力施諸勞方、使先行復工、繼談條件、故一般認爲該項工潮、有即日解決希望、決不致拖延時日、而法商電車公司之各路車輛、有於今日先行恢復駛行之說、</p>
<p>水電工人　加入罷工</p>
<p>又據新聲社記者探悉、法商水電公司、自電車部工人於十九日起聯合罷工後、迄已屆四日、雖經法租界當局設法調處、卒因勞資雙方意見相左、截止昨晚猶在僵持中、至於該公司所屬水電等部份全體工人、亦因要求增加工資等項、於昨日上午起亦加入罷工、惟據該公司大班法佛萊稱、法租界內自來水之供給、可不受影響、因該公司早於事前僱有俄籍工人若干名、可繼續開車出水、法租界居民可勿驚慌、</p>
<p>停車廠內　保護嚴密</p>
<p>法租界各路有軌無軌電車及公共汽車、昨晨依然停駛如故、所有車輛均停留呂班路工塲內、四週捕房派武裝探捕駐守保護、並置有鐵絲網架等障礙物、防範甚爲嚴密、惟法租界境內居民、因交通停頓、深感不便、均盼望早日解決、以維公共交通、惟昨日傍晚、據該公司有關部份透露消息、電車部查票員、可於今日出差工作、故車輛今日是吾恢復行駛、尙未可知、</p>
<p>英商電車　昨日談判</p>
<p>關於公共租界電車公司工人所提十二條件、昨日下午四時、勞資變方曾一度談判、勞方表示如所提要求、未能圓滿達到、將採取適當行動、條件中有一條要求、資方應允「工會」參與公司行政、並予完全承認「工會」一點、頗成問題、聞資方將拒絕接受、昨據該公司大班伊文語人稱、勞方要求加薪、非爲百分之一百五十、昨日所宣布者不確、但對於正確數額、則拒不透露、並對於工人所提條件、不允詳細公布、</p>

<p>疼痛有時候給予我們很多的麻煩，當我們有一點疼痛的時候，我們就會做出錯　的决斷，在營業上　受嚴重的損失，如果在集會的時候，不能把意見發表。至於在社交界中那是更有損害了，在約定的時候，不得不臨時取消我們的約會。</p>
<p>在家庭中之中，疼痛也是不容存在的，如果一個主婦患着月經痛，那末家庭生活就充滿着痛苦，兒童們儘是故　，當丈夫囘家的時候，看到睡在床上的妻子，　出無上的　　，所以疼痛足以影響我們身體的健康，間接也足以影響整個社會的安全。</p>

<p>— 顏省盦</p>
<p>「冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎？」大家這樣一喊，果然那塲雪也「馬後」到二月中旬才敷衍一下『能飲一杯無』的詩人底烟土披里純；然而氣候終究是春天，推窗一望，屋瓦未白，還是要「賦」也賦不起來的，其實普善山莊所發表的數字已是使人歎氣不已，除了「癡」人，那里還能「詩」興勃發呢！</p>
<p>現在像我這樣等等的人，自然是幸運的，因爲已經逃過『路有凍死骨』的一關而看到了鳥語花香，風和日暖的春天了，所以不免漫步一番，以示慶祝。—不過這「慶祝」是有個比喻的，有如犯了殺人之罪而一旦「無罪開釋」，法官雖然糊塗，心靈上不免還有無限歉意之感。</p>
<p>問題還不止內心的歉仄，外來的壓迫，春天也不會與冬天有什麼不同，醫如要漫步，穿一件短褂自然不妨事，（如果踏雪尋梅，那穿了皮袍，還缺不了紅綢的風兜及一匹羸弱的驢子；能有一個琴童更好。）然而肚子里總得裝一點東西的，—說得明白些，就是管別人家的事，也得吃飽自己的飯，還嫌說得不明白嗎？飯是要白米下鍋的，而白米的價格已超過了一百二十元！所以說是幸運，其實比不幸運的也不見得幸運了多少。</p>
<p>再說去年冬天還有些「慈善家」舉行平糶，穿了一襲破洋服擠在長蛇陣中，果然是見不得八面，（人家也不見得高興看你這付窮相！）但是這個世界是以「鈔票」來分等級的，所謂「祇重衣衫不重人」小過是一股怨氣冲天底發洩，不見頭髮高聳，洋服筆挺的大少爺正在計劃着綁「老頭子」的票，或者簽訂「待父天年」的票底兩重奏。一襲破洋服也管它媽的什麼「面子」！唉，春天一來，那才它媽的倒了霉！送終的送了終，沒有死的也好像已經「救濟成功」；長蛇陣愈接愈長，平糶的米却愈糶愈少，甚至拿了鈔票去換它個「沒有」！倒底米有沒有？據報上說是十萬包十萬包來的，眞弄得我好不糊塗。然而鈔票「沒有」却是眞的！</p>
<p>於是肥皂也「沒有」了！火柴也「沒有」了！……沒有」了！「沒有」！</p>
<p>春天來了。唉！唉！自然窮人不生富貴相，狗嘴里不出象牙，你如果再張大了眼睛看看，春天終究沒有虧待了老爺太太少爺奶奶們，正如冬天也沒有虐待他們一樣。</p>
<p>儘管船隻沒有，水脚增加，以致米（啊！又是米！）價飛漲，可是倫敦最新高貴衣料，已如期運來上海；一九四一年八汽缸××（那個名字忘了）汽車也已陳列在蠻大蠻大的玻璃窗厚毯的樣子間里。雖然標價已經改了U.S.Dorllor,然而抓進的外滙不也是美令嗎？於是：</p>
<p>『春天到了！一的歌聲從播音機中送了出來，「孤島」的空閒，就洋溢蒲溫暖的氣息，彷彿懷中小叭兒狗的微微鼾息一樣可愛。</p>
<p>不論是冬天，或春天，這兩種絕對的陣容在向着絕對的方向跑着，愈跑愈遠；換句話說，就是鈔票多者愈多，少者愈少！</p>

<p>— 石子</p>
<p>一個消息從城區傳到鄉間，說是五姑丈公為了囤穀，被糧警捉上去了，於是房族中無論男的女的，都把這消息當作新奇的新聞，互相傳告。</p>
<p>第二天，在浙東公報上刋登着一則小新聞，以觸目的標題：「劣紳劉××，囤榖居奇，昨已解縣懲處」登着。三伯父也因此而上縣城去設法營救</p>
<p>劉××就是我祖父的妹夫，以輩份上算，我應稱他為姑丈公；又為着他的妻子是我的第五個姑婆，因此我們小輩，都叫他五姑丈公，以咨與其他四個姑丈公有別。</p>
<p>五姑丈么寫得一手好字，他原本是個秀才，當地的人士，都公認他是個飽學之士。所以他應酬得頂忙的，就是替人家撰哀啟墓誌銘，及寫對聯，墓碑等事務。鄉下商店開張之喜的那天，假使中間沒有一副五姑丈公寫的對聯，那簡直是不成話。我的祖父就頂佩服五姑丈公的字，記得我小的時候，就是五姑丈公替我開的影格，那時他還對我大講其寫字秘訣，永字八法，可惜我不曾留心，現在都忘了。</p>
<p>這裏使我想起了已故的祖父，他老人家是個慈祥而又威嚴的人，而性情又是十分固執的，很少有個意見能在他的對面豎立起來，而獲得他的容忍；可是五姑丈公却例外地能建議祖父所不能容忍的，而竟能獲得祖父的同意。我每次見到五姑丈公拿着黃色捐簿進來，總是不失望的。</p>
<p>黃色的捐簿，大都是些募捐建造廟宇，重塑金身的玩意；而五姑丈公就是頂喜歡替佛門效勞。不僅如此，五姑丈公還每日做着佛門的功課，照着佛家的規矩，吃素，唸佛，每日祇吃兩餐，平時還時常對人講些佛法，勸人為善，他那副溫和的笑容，以及一刻不停的掄着手中唸珠，竟使素拘着「唸佛好當，放屁好壅田」主義的亡祖父，也動搖了意見，時時說，唸佛也不錯，至少是種修養。</p>
<p>眞的，五姑丈公最先給一般人的印像，是個大善士，吃素，唸佛的好人；父和氣，又肯幫助人。</p>
<p>祖父死後七期中，我碰到了五姑丈公，他還是那股大善士樣子，乖着三四寸長的花白鬍鬚，手掄着唸佛，未開口就滿　着笑瞼：</p>
<p>「上海可好？」</p>
<p>我告訴他上海的生活程度如何之高？米怎樣貴？餓死的怎樣的多？他連連的點着頭說</p>
<p>「還是上海好，還是上海好，你可知鄉下益發不得了？他停止了掄佛珠，騰出手來作姿勢：「近來鄉下每家的榖倉，都得搜查，多的就要充公；這算什麼話？有榖是我們自己有的，古人說「積榖防饑」，難道積榖就是犯了法嗎？那就祇好叫人餓肚子不吃飯了。」中途記起了掄念珠，「現在的政治，眞是無法無天，遠不如前淸的時候了。」</p>
<p>那天約略聽了他談了些「從何說起」的話，相隔不多幾天，就聽到他因為囤有數萬斤榖，而被查出，解到城裏去了。</p>
<p>立刻，這件事，就成了鄉下人談話的資料；紳士們大都是替五姑丈公抱不平，有的竟自願的到城裏云，找手使，以便援救五姑丈公。尤其是我的伯父們，更為了他們的五姑父，而奔走聲援；但是一般的鄉人，却是稱快一時。</p>
<p>據說五姑丈公在鄉間，因為勤儉耐勞，復加上一份祖上遺留的不薄的財產，居然是一鄉的首富。於是有許多窮苦的鄉民，以及小本經營而短資本的商人，大都向他借錢；而五姑丈公本着樂善好施的慈懷，無求不應；不過到了期，則須加上特別厚的利息，一起還淸。否則，寗願出些公費，請個律師，在法院裏告你一狀。鄉下人頂怕上衙門，於是祇得東湊西湊來淸償所欠；或者以次年的農作物，作賤價的抵押。因此，鄉下人凡是借過他錢的，沒有一個不恨得他入骨。</p>
<p>這次他就以歷年來鄉人所欠，而以榖作抵償的數萬斤榖藏着，起初，他也自知人緣不佳，把榖藏到機密的地方。後來，榖價由三百元一躍而到了五百元，於是他企圖把榖高價售人，但事機不密，讓鄉人告了密；第二天淸晨，糧警同着政工隊員突然光臨了，在柴間內搜出了數萬斤的積榖，連人連榖，如數的解上城裏云。不少的鄉下人，暗下拍着手掌說：「謝天謝地，活該，吃了窮人的，可得了報應。」</p>
<p>沒數天，三伯父從城裏歸來，聽說五姑丈公已釋放出來了，而查出的積榖，則充數作了平糶米。</p>

<p>「明天沈麻子的兄弟約定要來跟我們談談，想把明年的公事講一個妥當，那末這會的事就算一筆勾銷了。」趙四看着秋海棠說。</p>
<p>「大舞台的錢我可不想再賺了！」馬金濤放下烟槍，沒精打采地說；他也知道人家決不會再約他，便故意先這樣的說。</p>
<p>秋海棠慢慢地打烟舖上站起來，伸了伸腰。</p>
<p>「這會子我心裏亂得很，有事留着明天再商量吧！」他一面說，一面掀開門簾，就想跨出去；但走了一步，便又讓住了。「榮奎，跟我去問你一句話！」他回頭來單獨向榮奎說。</p>
<p>雖然他也知道這個小伙計太油滑了，多少帶一些危險性，可是幾年來已把他差使慣了，倒也很有些不能少他的感覺。</p>
<p>榮奎很恭順地隨着他走到樓梯口，想不出他有什麼話要問。</p>
<p>「下去向帳房裏間一個訊，可有人送過什麼信來沒有！」秋海棠用着很低的聲音囑咐他，臉上差不多就要紅起來了。</p>
<p>「慢些！」榮奎正想走下去，秋海棠又把他喊住了。「你告訴他們，只要有信送來，不管什麼時候，就給我帶上來…。那是很要緊的信！」</p>
<p>要榮奎去辦這種沒有銀錢出入的事，比較上是最可靠的，不消幾分鐘，他就回上來了。</p>
<p>「現在沒有什麼信，他們說一有就給你送上來。」</p>
<p>秋海棠掏出一隻夜光錶來看了一看，知道羅湘綺即使有回信，也不會在深夜十一點鐘的時候派人送來了。事實上，這封回信直到第三天早上才從郵政局寄來，信封以內，還有信封，顯見寄的人是怎樣的小心，信也寫得很長，至少有秋海棠去信的十倍。</p>
<p>這一個上半天，他差不多沒有和趙四馬金　金大個子一班人見過面，湘綺的信，像世界上一種最濃厚的膠水一樣把他牢牢黏住在床前的一張小桌上。　（六一）</p>

<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>在今日的醫學裏，毒瘤（Cancer）仍然是一種最感棘手的疾病。其原因乃是由於毒瘤的病徵不甚明顯，到了病人感覺痛楚時，可說是毒瘤的最後危險的信號，醫治是相當困難的。下面列舉五條毒瘤重要的信號。假如發覺了後，也用不着憂傷，也用不着恐懼，最安妥的方法，莫如平心靜氣的去找一位醫術高明的醫生，把病徵盡情告訴他，請他替你行一全身健康檢查，假如眞的發現了毒瘤，立刻施以合理的醫治，痊瘉就有大大的希望了。</p>
<p>（一）固定的瘤或腫厚物，特別是在胸部。</p>
<p>（二）身體各孔道，不正常的出血事排泄。</p>
<p>（三）不能治瘉的疼痛，特別是在口，舌，唇的周圍。</p>
<p>（四）持久的消化不良，隨之而體重頓减。</p>
<p>（五）墨痣或疣突然的改變形狀或改變生長的速率。</p>

<p>續集「夜半歌聲」，較之上部似乎有遜色的地方。可是它的題材，還是那麼的酋勁；它的意識還是那麼積極，反抗的雄圖。仍舊是溢揚於整個連續的畫面，毫不假借，一無含糊。從這裏，也可見馬徐維邦的藝術良心，鄭重的工作態度。我希望他，一直如此忠貞幹下去。</p>
<p>檢討該片最大的缺點，是言語多於行動。也因為這才使若干鏡頭感覺到稍嫌呆滯。假使嚴格苛求一點的話，太多的是理論的說敎，缺少對光明的歌頌，這朱始不是深以為憾的一點。</p>
<p>放鏡頭的角度，燈光的安置，膠片的剪接，導演者都有着優越的成就。證之畫面的美麗，即可見其對於構圖的用心。諸如淡入，淡出，複印等等攝影技巧，也為近年來國片中所不易看到的。</p>
<p>有人說：馬徐維邦是導演羣中瞭解電影手法，懂得「蒙太奇」的一個。確實的，他沒有把膠片浪費，手法也乾凈得很，這樣也許不為那輩看慣了交代淸楚的民間電影觀衆所歡迎，但是以整個的影片映出講，它是在一般水準以上的。</p>
<p>故事發展的合理，深深地暴露了封建制度的殘酷，勇敢發刻劃了千萬靑年誓死與黑勢力搏鬥的艱苦的過程。</p>
<p>劉瓊飾宋丹萍，成績超過他歷來的紀錄。尤其那段彳亍於村落中，無聲的表演，最為特色。他已把滿腔憤懣憎惡的心懷，絮絮地傳達出來；縱然他有着部分的缺點，可是他的用功，他的鄭重，是自今小生羣中特出的一個，我們祈望着他更努力！</p>
<p>王竹友校之施超，似有遜色。最大的缺點：悲哀時不够沉痛，跑步時不够英俊；表情也流於定型，這完全是事前太少想像的緣故。</p>
<p>談瑛與其他演員，由於導演的努力，他們都已達到了一定的水準。</p>
<p>總之，在當今影壇上，它的確可以炫耀於大衆，是一件非常完整的藝術品！</p>

<h3 id="c118">蕩婦心 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 黃新德</p>
<p>看了「蕩婦心」這樣的戲名而去看這部片子，那末在看過之後，至少可以得到兩種新奇的感覺。第一，一向以晤女郎著名的安秀麗丹，這一次領銜主演，而飾的並不是蕩婦。第二，飾蕩婦的伊黛羅碧諾，以前成績平平，却意外地獲得空前的成就。還有，那就是亨茀萊鮑嘉這回沒有做强盜。</p>
<p>以上雖是閑話，但似乎有一提的必要。因為故事的重心是安置在伊黛羅碧的身上。喬治賴甫德在劇裏，是飾一個汽車的司機，同時却也是一個頂天立地的男子漢。他的朋友兼老板的太太羅碧諾，看中了他，他毅然拒絕了她的愛，只和小家碧玉安秀麗丹往來，於是老板娘頓起毒心，將她的丈夫害死，以為賴甫德從此可以無所顧忌，但賴甫德依然敬謝不　，老板娘無計可施，只得反咬一口，說下毒手的固然是我，但主謀的却是他，可是當賴甫行德鬧到監獄裏的時候，她因太受刺激，神經反常，才將眞情吐露，賴甫德才能得免一死。</p>
<p>故事雖然和潘金蓮有些相似，但以本片角色支配的適當，以及劇情發展的有力，在演出上，就覺得非常緊張與刺激，全劇自老板娘看中汽車夫起以至公堂發瘋止，抽蕉剝繭，一氣呵成，使觀衆一點沒有放鬆的機會。演得最好的，要推伊黛羅碧諾，她不僅備具了蕩婦的姿態，而且也刻畫了蕩婦的心腸，初見時那般挑逗的熱情，和好事不成時那種不肯死心塌地仍舊希冀於萬一的樣子，在演技上講，該可以算是達到最高峯。尤其是法庭發瘋一塲，演來活龍活現，眞有觀止之槪。賴甫德演武松型的人物，剛毅强勁，也恰到好處。安秀麗丹也許是個性不合，也許是可演之戲太少，成績却甚平平。</p>
<p>此劇全半部側重於賴甫德和亨茀萊鮑嘉開汽車做生意，雖然那些汽車闖禍的塲面，攝製得十分逼眞，但似乎太長一些，因為把前面這些枝節　减，對於劇情的發展，是沒有妨碍的，導演者大槪是為了支配角色而不得不如此做的吧？</p>

<p>Washington - Mr. Bullitt, the US Ambassador to France, delivered a radio address tonight, calling on all sectors to support the work of the United American Relief Fund for Chinese Disasters. Bullitt said that Chairman Chiang is a great leader of a great people, and the army under his leadership is standing in an important position to defend democratic countries (including the United States). The American people are now focusing their eyes on Europe, so that we cannot imagine the bloodshed and suffering suffered by the Chinese people due to the Japanese invasion and their admirable and tearful heroism, which is even worse than the European war. Although China lacks modern weapons, it can still use rifles, intelligence, and courage to resist the Japanese army. Now the Japanese army has been blocked and cannot advance any further. After three years and eight months of war, Japan has fallen into the quagmire of China and cannot make any progress, while China is still continuing to resist. I still remember when I visited China in 1934, I had a long conversation with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing. At that time, Chiang not only predicted to me that Japan would definitely be defeated in China, but also predicted the time when the Japanese would attack and the place where they would launch their first attack. Chiang had already predicted the course of the war, roughly saying that he was already preparing for the war in Sichuan at that time. Now, Chairman Chiang's words have all come true. Chiang is now sitting in "China's Valley Forge. Valley Forge was the base of the American Revolution led by Washington." Bullitt's words refer to Sichuan. Chiang also said at the time that he would never surrender, and that he would never stop resisting until the Japanese army withdrew from Chinese territory. Now Chiang has insisted on resisting the war, and the Chinese people are even more determined to follow him with a renewed patriotic heart and determination. The Chinese people are still free people, and they still have the spirit of sacrifice and unyielding. I believe that if China maintains its independence and drives the Japanese out of the country, then in the next ten years, Chinese culture will be promoted and developed. Any assistance given to the suffering people of China at this time is a contribution to culture and to the anti-totalitarian dictatorship. (Dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Manila - US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, announced today that the Civilian Emergency Planning Office has drafted a group of detailed procedures, advocating that the Philippine government should promote self-sufficiency in food throughout the Philippines. Under this procedure, Sayre stated that this procedure depends entirely on the Philippines organizing and providing its finances. The question of whether the responsibility for protecting the people should be borne by the United States or the Philippines has been debated for a long time. Philippine President Quezon recently said that the United States should be responsible for defending the Philippines, and that the Philippine government has no funds to further expand the civilian defense program. Sayre said that he has not yet received a notification from the State Department to evacuate American families from the Philippines. He said that although there has been a significant increase in the number of Americans evacuating in the past few months, there are no plans to consider air raid drills or evacuation. The Philippines is the only place in the Far East that has not implemented air defense exercises. The Army and Navy have expressed their willingness to provide technical advice to assist this program, and have also stated that in the event of an emergency or the declaration of martial law, the Army and Navy may assume the entire program. The Army is now putting pressure on the Philippine government to establish a foreign registration law, which would provide a complete record of foreigners in an emergency. Although Sayre has announced the procedures planned by his office, reliable sources have pointed out that the movement to protect civilians has not made progress. In the event of a crisis in the Far East, this place will be the first to be at risk, because the authority is not unified at present. (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>London - The chairman of the McCallie Bank recently spoke at the bank's annual meeting, reporting that although almost all Chinese seaports were controlled last year, and the control and restrictions on trade in Shanghai increased, China's international trade was still maintained to a considerable extent. However, Japan's participation in the Tripartite Pact and the threat of war spreading to the Far East have further reduced this trade. Japan's internal economy is affected by the government's heavy burden of raising military expenses, which has dispersed its ability to take advantage of the opportunity for European countries to participate in the war to make great profits. If Japan can maintain regular relations with other countries, this opportunity will definitely belong to it. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Japanese journalist Nito recently published an article analyzing the current situation in the Pacific. His article roughly stated that if Japan goes to war with the United States, it should know that this is a long-term "life-and-death battle." If Japan can defeat the British and American fleets and control the Dutch East Indies and other important strongholds in the Pacific, then the United States will definitely fail. However, the United States is blessed with abundant natural resources, and even after the failure, its strength has not been lost at all. In addition, the Japanese army cannot be sent to land in the United States. The United States is bound to rebuild its navy to retaliate. From this, it can be seen that Japan will definitely encounter a long-term war if it fights with the United States. During this period, Japan must control the Pacific, as far west as Malaya, because the raw materials there are abundant, which is crucial for engaging in a long-term war. In short, if Japan goes to war with the United States, it will take at least ten years, and this "war is not limited to the military aspect, but will also unfold fierce struggles in the political, economic, and ideological aspects."

Mars also said that the tonnage of the super battleships did not exceed the 45,000-ton limit of the naval restriction treaty, because the tonnage stipulated in the treaty was the weight of the warships themselves, and after the installation of artillery and armor, "the tonnage will greatly increase."

<h3 id="e9">People's Food in the Midst of Panic <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>In the rice market in the past two months or so, prices have broken limits and soared. For small-milled rice, the premium has been as high as 4,300 to 4,400 yuan per hundred bags. As a result, people are panicking, it is difficult to obtain food, public opinion is boiling, and the people are resentful. The other day, the Board of Directors of the Public Concession held a meeting, saying that a plan to stabilize the rice market would be announced soon. The citizens are eagerly awaiting this, like a drought waiting for rain clouds, which has been a long time. The biggest reason for the rise in rice prices this time is the increasing tension in the Pacific situation and the increasing greed of rice hoarders. This involves ship problems, freight problems, license problems, and all kinds of details have become excuses. These people believe that as the war situation expands, it will inevitably lead to the interruption of sea transport and the cut off of food routes. The entire Shanghai has the possibility of running out of food, so rice is as precious as pearls, and no food is not expensive. At this time, only I have it, and who dares to criticize the skyrocketing prices and who dares to limit them? The exorbitant profits obtained are more than doubled. This is why, at present, they would rather be scolded by all parties, not thinking that the food panic is really happening this day. The rice of the hoarders can still be manipulated freely without being requisitioned, which is really unthinkable.</p>
<p>The rice market has been disrupted to the point where it is today. It is not to make harsh comments, to be lazy in action, and not to take people's food seriously, which has also led to this. Things should not be one-sided, and they have not been able to be cautious at the beginning, but have concerns in the future. Therefore, public opinion is complicated, and the will is hesitant, and nothing can be done. Moreover, the complexity of the content of the food problem and the unpredictability of the changing situation require an agency that specializes in responsible planning and strategy, and makes plans early. Having the power to act expediently, then few can achieve success. But this is not the plan, so when the drastic changes in the grain market come, the response is always difficult, and the actions cannot be practical. It is only said that monitoring the market and setting price limits are enough to remove the courage of unscrupulous merchants and achieve the effect of stability. This is also a left-handed plan. Past events do not need to be pursued, but there are still things that cannot be said about the future of the grain market.</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Concession has its international character, so no matter how turbulent the world events are, if Shanghai's position can still maintain its original position through international cooperation, it will be beneficial to merchants of all countries. Otherwise, the more unstable and uneasy the society is, the greater the suffering felt by the vast majority of Chinese people, and the more dangerous the public security will become. How can merchants of all countries still live and work in peace? This shows that the interests and harms are shared by merchants of all countries and the Chinese people. If you want to maintain the peace and stability of the Shanghai situation, in terms of economy, first remove what is enough to endanger public security, it is better to equalize grain prices, and then everyone can live and work in peace and achieve their lives, then merchants of all countries can make profits. Therefore, how to supply, store, adjust, and equalize Shanghai's food is not only the responsibility of the two concession authorities, but merchants of all countries, even if they do not directly assume the difficult task of regulating people's food, should also provide good-faith assistance, so that the Shanghai food problem will not become more serious.</p>
<p>(2) The rice merchants and hoarders are so eloquent because (a) the Japanese army's southward advance will be the only obstacle to the source of rice and grain in the future; (b) there is a lack of loading ships, and even if there is fixed rice, it cannot obtain cabin space; (c) the increase in freight costs makes the cost heavier, and it is impossible to reduce it; (d) most of the rice in Saigon is under the control of the Japanese and is not easy to transport; (e) it is often difficult to obtain collection and transport certificates for rice in Hong Kong and Yangon, which affects the source. However, these five points can also be easily resolved if merchants of all countries cooperate. If Japan really advances southward and a war breaks out, it has nothing to do with Shanghai. Shanghai's international relations are far more complicated than those of the countries that may participate in the war in the future, so its nature will not change due to the attitude of some countries, and it can always be maintained outside the situation. Unless the international chaos is so great that public law is swept away, no country can blockade Shanghai. Therefore, at that time, there will be special ships for transporting grain, and they will not be intercepted or obstructed. Everything is so complicated that Shanghai is in the cracks. It is easy to destroy it, but the opportunities to jointly preserve it are subtle and numerous.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, market management should abandon the old-fashioned laissez-faire and become organized and methodical de facto management. The current price limit method is the easiest to generate dark disks; once there is a dark disk, the price limit loses its effectiveness; once the price is limited, it is higher each time, and often gets the opposite result. If you take open evaluation, there should be no such drawbacks. The reason why the current evaluation is still a price limit, so the evaluation is made every three days, and the discussion is held every five days, which cannot adapt to the changes in business conditions, and how can it see the macro effect of equalizing market prices. The market price changes endlessly, up and down are impermanent, and there is profit in selling, and there is nothing in no profit, which is its constant situation. But you want to use the engraved price limit to equalize the uncertain market price. This is not that the price limit is not effective, but it is really the fault of misusing the price limit. Therefore, what the open evaluation wants to do is, instead of having an uncontrollable dark disk premium, it is better to determine the market disk based on the supply and demand situation in the market, and freely rise and fall. It should be high, but the high is not caused by manipulation and hoarding; it should be low, but the low is not for deliberate suppression. Merchants will have no excuse, and the market will not be abnormal. The reason why the responsible agency must select commissioners to personally visit the market and open the price with their own eyes, and not completely entrust it to the public discussion of merchants, is precisely because merchants only value private interests and disregard public interests. Only joint evaluation can remove its exaggeration and correct its illegality. The situation of the business market is clear, and it is easier to crack down and correct. Now it is treated as a general public affair, and no direct and effective action has been taken. It should be as messy as managing silk.</p>
<p>(4) If you take open evaluation, there must be reliable investigation and registration of the surplus and deficiency of goods arriving, inventory and sales, and the ups and downs of the market, so as to be used. If you want to ensure the safety of the people's food, before the system of public purchase and sale, only under the principle of taking into account the interests of all parties, do not do too much, do not let it go, do not hinder the supply of people's food, do not hinder the profits of small sellers, and do not allow the fact of manipulation and hoarding to occur. This is the most important technical problem in the administration of people's food. The use of it depends on the person, and not all legislative courses can measure the success.</p>
<p>(5) For the current plan, thoroughly investigating the actions of hoarders is not allowed to be delayed. It is clear that the investigation layer may have its difficulties, but these difficulties are not difficult to solve. To make a whole plan for the people's food, we must investigate how much rice is hoarded and not sold. On the one hand, we should first persuade rice merchants that before the rice price in Shanghai is equalized, all the rice sold should be limited to the sale of Shanghai rice industry. The method should be discussed by the public, and those who violate it should be punished. There is nothing else, temporarily use all the rice in Shanghai to help Shanghai's current use.</p>
<p>Public sale of food and rationing of grain according to the population is a fair method and the ultimate management method. Famous countries have their established rules, and there are many precedents in the world, but it is not necessary to talk about it in today's Shanghai. What Shanghai needs urgently: First, to enforce the law according to the current administrative orders, and to punish severely to remove the courage of unscrupulous merchants. One is to encourage group purchase of rice, eliminate profiteering, and open up sources of goods by themselves. One is that the public sector invests in purchase and transportation as the basis, and then makes good use of its power; either in the form of treasury bills, or in the spirit of requisition, releases the hoarded rice to the market. We recognize that the environment is bad and there are thorns everywhere, but this is not enough to justify inaction; the reason why we need to find a remedy now is precisely because the environment is bad. It is also like seeking treatment because of illness, and it is not allowed to postpone the medicine because the illness is difficult to handle.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Kong Xiangxi Issues a Statement on the KMT-CPC Issue, Believes the Stalemate Can Be Resolved, Denies Strict Action Will Be Taken <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - Vice President Kong recently told an Associated Press reporter that he believes that the stalemate between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party can be resolved and that there is no fear of conflict. Kong said, "I believe that a serious crisis will not occur and that the current stalemate can be resolved." Father said that the Communist Party, due to unreasonable fears, has recently gathered its main forces to engage in illegal expansion of territory and teams in an attempt to consolidate its forces. The disregard and even disobedience of orders by these people is caused by this unreasonable suspicion. He also said that he did not believe that any crisis would occur, because he believed that the Communist Party leaders were all intelligent people and determined to resist and build. These people have fully realized the consequences of rebellion against the government. He and his colleagues did not recognize the news that the government had decided to take strict action, and did not recognize the news that the Japanese had organized an "anti-communist army" to attack the Communist Party. When reporters asked Kong for comments on the rumors that Kong was one of the Chinese leaders who advocated peace, Kong smiled and said, "I certainly advocate peace. If I did not believe in peace, I would not be a descendant of my ancestor Confucius. If I did not believe in peace and friendship among mankind, I would not be a true Christian. But according to this doctrine, I believe in the doctrine that I want to survive, and others also want to survive. We did not attack Japan, and we have repeatedly tried to be patient. We were forced to resist, and we were forced to fight against Japan." When asked if China could cooperate with Japan, co-govern East Asia, conquer other parts of Asia, and incorporate China, Kong replied, "China's territory is already very large. What China requires is to be able to do what I want within its own territory. China has no intention of aggression and is not willing to cooperate with anyone in aggression. If other nations, such as Japan, think that they can induce us in this way, then Japan can be said to be ignorant of the Chinese people." (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Government is indeed confident in controlling the military situation of the Communist Party, which can be proved by the following figures. Although officials are unwilling to disclose the exact number of troops of the Central Government, it is reported that there are currently at least 300 divisions, while the Communist Party has a maximum of only nine divisions equipped with rifles, and the rest are mostly guerrillas without proper training or equipment.

<p>Chongqing - When the American Young Women's Christian Association presented a brooch to Madame Chiang Song Meiling yesterday, Madame Chiang made a reply, saying, "I personally dare not accept this gift, but I accept it as a gift to the Chinese women. In the past, China has had many talented women, but lacked organization to unite and cooperate women, but since the establishment of the Young Women's Christian Association, we have an organization to show how we should cooperate." Madame Chiang also expressed her hope that China, Britain, and the United States will continue to cooperate to achieve the final victory. This victory is not only China's victory, but also the victory of justice, human freedom, and international cooperation. Chairman Chiang also made a brief speech, ordering Chinese women to live up to the expectations of the American women and congratulating Chinese women on their achievements in war work and their current status in China. American Ambassador Johnson said that he had no right to participate in this grand ceremony, but in his capacity as the American Ambassador, he believed that the American women could be proud to know the Chinese women through Madame Chiang. He said, "A few weeks ago, I expressed to Madame Chiang my great confidence in the Chinese women, especially in the past ten years. I have observed the Chinese women and deeply admired their enthusiasm, courage, and wisdom. I want to congratulate the American women on knowing the Chinese women. The wife of Chongqing Mayor Wu Guozhen introduced Madame Chiang, claiming that this contribution was made by the American women voluntarily and not by official action, so its significance is even more important, and Madame Chiang and other recipients of the needle are listed alongside the British Queen (yesterday's newspaper reported the Central Queen, a mistake in the telegram) and Mrs. Roosevelt, promising to recognize Madame Chiang as the leader among the world's women and to recognize that the three countries have common ideals and goals, and Madame Chiang has also made many contributions to the cooperation of the three countries' people."

<p>Capital of the South Country: After ten days of extremely tense diplomatic activity, the cabinet convened a meeting last night that adjourned only this morning. The government's attitude towards the Axis powers' proposal may have been finalized. It is generally speculated that the discussions centered on finding a compromise between the conditions originally proposed by the South Country for concluding a non-aggression pact with Germany and Germany's desire for the South Country to join the Tripartite Pact. It is expected that government leaders will travel to Germany soon (possibly on Sunday) to sign a compromise agreement. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Reliable sources declared today that after three and a half hours of deliberation, the cabinet has approved the government's negotiations with Germany to adhere to the Tripartite Pact in a special form. This marks a further step towards the South Country's alignment with the Axis. However, official sources did not directly mention Germany, stating only that "the cabinet met from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and the meeting was entirely devoted to discussing the acute diplomatic and political situation." Reliable sources declared yesterday that negotiations between Yugoslavia have been completed and that the South Country government is only awaiting Germany's invitation for its Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to sign a special form of adherence to the Tripartite Pact. The so-called special form means that the South Country will not bear the obligations stipulated in the military clauses of the Tripartite Pact. The South Country's adherence to the Axis does not mean that German troops will enter the South Country, but the South Country must, of course, prohibit anti-Axis forces within its borders. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>London: Reuter's diplomatic correspondent stated that responsible sources here believe that the reports of a compromise between Yugoslavia and Germany should be treated with the utmost reservation. The experiences of Romania and Bulgaria must make Yugoslavia highly skeptical of any proposals from Germany. Therefore, before receiving more reliable information, people here are highly doubtful that the South Country has surrendered. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<p>Berlin: Dr. Balaje, President of the National Bank of Hungary, arrived here yesterday to visit Fink, President of the German National Bank. Mr. Balaje held talks with Fink yesterday afternoon to discuss issues related to economic relations between the two countries. (Haitong, 21st)</p>
<p>Budapest: As Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka is about to arrive in Berlin, Hungarian Foreign Minister Bardossy suddenly traveled to Munich, Germany, with the German Minister to Hungary, Edmund Veesenmayer. The nature of this is extremely important. According to diplomatic sources here, the Turkish President's reply to Chancellor Hitler has arrived in Berlin, and Germany has also obtained sufficient information on the Yugoslav issue and is about to decide on a response. Foreign Minister Bardossy's trip is probably related to these two matters. According to the influential "Ujsag" newspaper, Foreign Minister Bardossy will review diplomatic policies with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Hungary's participation in the negotiations of the Axis powers at the most appropriate time will allow it to share in the work of rebuilding the world. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Preventing War from Spreading to the Balkans: British and Turkish Opinions Converge</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu returned here yesterday after meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden on Cyprus and attended a cabinet meeting to report on his discussions with the British Foreign Secretary. It is reported that the meeting between British and Turkish diplomatic officials further proves that the two countries' opinions are completely in line with the desire to prevent the spread of war to the Balkans. The two foreign ministers reportedly discussed plans on how to achieve this goal. Eden undoubtedly informed Saracoğlu of the aid that Britain intends to provide to Greece. Turkish newspapers commenting on the meeting of the two foreign ministers all said that Eden's arrival in this crisis-ridden Near East is worth as much as an army corps of the American Empire. The newspapers also emphasized the position of Yugoslavia in the Balkans. The Turkish people are increasingly united in their determination to defend their national independence. It is reported that the Turkish government will dispatch personnel to the most remote areas to explain government policies. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Ankara: According to reliable sources, diplomatic officials from the Soviet Union and Turkey have recently been in frequent contact. The Soviet government has clearly explained its attitude towards Turkey to the Turkish government and provided concrete "guarantees." When British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps traveled to Ankara to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Army Committee General Dill, who will guide the storage of imported staple foods, expansion of transportation and trains, and expansion of air defense volunteer teams to prepare for possible emergencies, the Soviet government immediately provided Turkey with several guarantees. Afterwards, the Soviet Union and Turkey continued to hold talks and exchange views, and as a result, the Soviet Union's attitude has become completely clear. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu then rushed to British Cyprus to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden, and then hurried back to Ankara to meet with President İsmet İnönü to report on his trip. This afternoon, Prime Minister Saydam convened a cabinet meeting to discuss Foreign Minister Saracoğlu's report. According to well-informed sources, the two foreign ministers discussed issues related to the Salonika region and the Dardanelles Strait, as well as "other" issues. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Washington: It was learned yesterday that Germany is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the United States. The German Embassy in the United States, according to instructions from Berlin, has issued notices to German diplomatic and consular representatives in the United States, asking whether they wish to be sent back to their home country if Germany and the United States sever relations. It is understood that the notice strongly emphasizes that Germany does not intend to be the first to take this severe step of severing relations with the United States. However, the letter points out that this move by Germany is only intended to prepare for the rapid repatriation of representatives stationed in the United States in the event that US-German relations are severed. News in Washington recalled recent newspaper reports that all German diplomatic and consular personnel stationed in the United States had been ordered to "pack their bags" in preparation for returning home.

<p>Tokyo: According to Berlin sources, Foreign Minister Matsuoka and his party may arrive in Berlin on March 26. The Soviet government provided a special train for their passage through Siberia. Matsuoka and others will travel in two special carriages and arrive in Irkutsk on the morning of March 19. They may arrive in Moscow on March 23. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Moscow: German Ambassador to Japan, General Ott, left here last night for Berlin. (Haitong, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: Hayden, a well-known commentator familiar with Far Eastern events, recently stated that Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Europe aims to reduce Japan's constraints within the Axis, rather than impose greater obligations on Japan. Matsuoka will tell Hitler that the threat of a combined British, American, and Soviet attack prevents Japan from taking action unless Germany and Italy provide assistance, but German and Italian assistance is obviously impossible. Hayden said that his views are based on reports from observers in American official circles. State Department personnel do not seem to attach any importance to the "Asahi Shimbun" of Tokyo's claim that Matsuoka's trip will produce immeasurable and important results. The Tokyo talk of the importance of this trip is mostly by moderate elements, while supporters of Matsuoka's fascism are more silent. The reason why moderate elements have such talk is to set off the failure of Matsuoka's diplomacy. All Americans who know Matsuoka know that Matsuoka is merely a blowhard and has no substance. Therefore, his trip to Europe is not valued. American observers in Japan all say that if Matsuoka returns without a solid way for Japan to escape the Axis, unless the Axis powers achieve a significant military victory, Matsuoka will lose his position and the Konoe Cabinet will also fall.

<p>London: A Reuter correspondent from a location on the south coast of England reports that the British troops guarding the coast are fully prepared to repel any Nazi invasion attempts. The reporter recently visited a certain location on the south coast to inspect the defenses and witnessed the defense forces conducting enemy engagement exercises. Coastal searchlights shone far into the sea, emitting dazzling rays. If Nazi troops attempt to invade, there is no way to hide. Artillery and other weapons can deploy defensive power within half a minute of hearing the alert. Nighttime defense against surprise attacks relies on lighting. If the enemy attacks using dense fog or smoke screens, the British defense forces also have other detection methods to prevent the enemy from escaping. Coastal searchlights, reaching 15 million candlepower, sweep the sea surface, diminishing the moonlight. Six-inch coastal guns are densely deployed, ready to strike invading forces with 100-pound shells. Even if German ships carrying troops evade the central naval air force, they will be severely attacked by land forces. Heavy troops are stationed inland, guarding defense posts, bridges, and public buildings, ready to annihilate enemy forces attempting to invade England. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A local newspaper published an article by Colonel Klin on the Atlantic war, stating that the world's second "blitzkrieg" has now lasted for a year and a half. If the Axis powers want to win the war, they must achieve a decisive victory before the summer of this year. If they pass the summer, the Allied countries will become stronger and the Axis powers will not succeed. Germany can only seek victory through offense or blockade. However, Germany may not attempt to invade England. Since last fall, most people have recognized that invading England is too difficult. Now, it is even more difficult because England is becoming stronger. To invade England, one must have the ability to control the surface of the sea for the advance, protect against enemy air force interference, and break through coastal defenses. The German side does not possess any of these conditions. Therefore, invading England may only be a form of intimidation. If so, then Germany can only achieve victory through blockade. The German side now has better submarine bases, but the means to combat submarines are also constantly improving. Although the United States transferred 50 destroyers to England, it still has 211 ships. Japan only has 83 ships. Therefore, the United States can still allocate 100 destroyers to intervene directly across the Atlantic or transfer them to England to counter German submarines. In addition, the United States has a large number of military launches being manufactured and a large number of ships sheltering in American ports that can also be transferred to England. Furthermore, British bombers have repeatedly attacked German submarine bases, causing the German submarines to suffer heavy losses. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<p>London: A Reuter military correspondent reports that the British attack on the Lofoten Islands and the recovery of Baabilé have caused the enemy to fear that their war front is extended and that they may be subjected to similar attacks at any time from Norway in the north to the Red Sea in the south. The recovery of Baabilé has given the British army several advantages in the Abyssinian war, such as shortening the sea route by 400 miles and making the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway available for use by the British army, thus facilitating transportation. However, the attitude of Vichy officials in Djibouti towards this issue still needs to be watched. However, the control of all sea routes to the Far East by the Central Powers has now become more stable. At the same time, the Battle of Keren seems to be nearing a satisfactory conclusion.

<p>Athens: It is reported that Greek troops entered Tepelenë yesterday morning (the last important town on the road to Vlorë) and occupied the city after fierce fighting with Italian troops, capturing a large number of enemy soldiers and war materiel. Yesterday, the Athens radio station broadcast a statement from the Greek Information Department stating that an attempt by Italian troops in the central sector of the Albanian front to break through the Greek line failed again. The Italian troops launched a local counterattack with tanks, although on a limited scale, but its intensity was no less than the offensive of last week. The attempt was to open the road so that Italian infantry could advance, but the Greek troops were determined to resist and fired intensively with direct-fire artillery. One tank was hit and overturned, and two more were hit and destroyed. The remaining vehicles turned and retreated quickly, regardless of the Italian infantry being heavily bombarded by Greek artillery and machine-gun fire. The Italian counterattacks were brave, like a tide, but were swept across the battlefield, causing heavy losses to the enemy. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<p>Plymouth. Last night and this morning, a German air fleet dropped no fewer than ten thousand incendiary bombs and hundreds of high-explosive bombs on Plymouth, a city previously subjected to heavy bombing. Not only were the already shattered houses and shops completely razed, but also several new areas that had not been bombed were pockmarked with bomb craters. The dreadful bombing has turned the city into countless pits, and piles of broken rafters, shattered tiles, broken bricks are everywhere. As a result of the tragic bombing, no fewer than several thousand residents are homeless. The destroyed debris continues to emit thick smoke, rising into the sky. The scene in the city is as if it had undergone a severe earthquake. Residences, government offices, shops, apartments, and hotels, after several hours of violent attacks by German aircraft, have become a wasteland. Many streets have been destroyed, and countless destroyed buildings have piled up, blocking traffic. Almost everywhere in the city is in ruins. Large formations of German aircraft attacked the city continuously from dusk until after midnight. Fire and explosions shook the entire city, and the deafening sound of anti-aircraft fire was mixed into the chaos. Many places caught fire, and the red glow illuminated the sky. This morning, thousands of displaced people wandered the streets covered with broken bricks, tiles, glass shards, broken timber, and dust, their expressions terrifying. Some were in tattered clothes, others were wounded and wore blood-stained bandages. Most people had only brought out their bedding, as these items were taken out hastily while fleeing to safety. Still others dug through the ruins, salvaging the few possessions they had. Rescue teams are working courageously, tirelessly searching and digging through countless tons of rubble, hoping to rescue those trapped within. As of this morning, their work had not abated. Throughout the city, many people could be seen searching for their families, relatives, and friends, who had been scattered while rushing to various air-raid shelters during last night's bombing. This scene was another unbearable tragedy to witness. Two large hotels were completely destroyed, but fortunately, everyone in the hotels had been evacuated to safety beforehand, and no one was harmed. Three large department stores, six public assembly halls, and three churches were also destroyed in last night's tragic raid. Nazi aircraft followed their usual tactics last night. The first wave of aircraft arrived at dusk and dropped flares. After the first wave dropped flares, dozens of German aircraft took turns flying in, dropping incendiary bombs like rain. Finally, heavy bombers arrived, dropping high-explosive bombs and unleashing their destructive work. The violent air raid continued for six hours, and its intensity only subsided after midnight. According to a joint communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, many fires broke out last night. Most of the buildings attacked by fire were shops. Some fires were very intense, but by this morning, the fires had been brought under control. Many parts of the city were damaged, but according to reports received so far, the casualties are not very high. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. During the day, enemy aircraft activity was light over England. Last night, as twilight approached, an alert was issued in the London area, which was lifted at midnight. Enemy aircraft appeared to have snuck in from the Thames Estuary, and anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely. Enemy aircraft are also believed to have snuck into areas near the southwest and east of Anglia. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that enemy aircraft snuck into the Kent coast, strafing streets in a certain town and dropping bombs in two locations. It is reported that there was slight damage to houses and light casualties. Bombs also fell in an area on the south coast, causing very little damage. Furthermore, a Navy communiqué stated that German dive bombers attacked ships yesterday afternoon and were shot down by machine gun fire from two British boats. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin. A well-informed Nazi Party headquarters announced that the six-hour heavy bombing of London by German aircraft on Wednesday night was the beginning of the "Spring Offensive." Officials also explicitly stated that the goal of the Spring Offensive was to "completely starve the British Isles." The exchange of bombing raids between the British and German air forces has sufficiently proven that Germany has at least fifteen times more aircraft than Britain. In the coming weeks, when Germany expands its air raids, the ratio of German aircraft superiority will likely exceed this figure. All recent attacks on Britain have been concentrated on Britain's "lungs," such as Hull, Cardiff, Liverpool, Glasgow, and London, all of which are located around the island, and this is indeed a key strategy in strengthening the submarine war and cutting off Britain's sea lanes. Furthermore, a German evening newspaper warned the United States against aiding Britain, calling it "Roosevelt's Dangerous Gamble." (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>London. A Navy communiqué stated that British submarines have achieved another victory in attacking Italian maritime traffic. The British submarine "Utmost" attacked two Italian transport ships fully loaded with troops, weighing six thousand tons and four thousand tons respectively. Escorted by warships, they were hit by torpedoes fired by the British submarine, causing very violent explosions. At least one of them must have been completely destroyed. The British submarine "Triumph" sank two Italian supply ships carrying military supplies, weighing two thousand five hundred tons each. The British submarine "Unique" also fired a torpedo, hitting an Italian supply ship weighing three thousand tons, fully loaded with military supplies, in a convoy. It must have been lost. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. A communiqué stated that on the nights of last Saturday and Sunday, aircraft from the British Naval Air Arm repeatedly attacked the ports of Valona and Durazzo, sinking or damaging several ships. Among them was an Italian cruiser or a large destroyer. British aircraft achieved six or seven direct hits, causing significant damage to the Italian ships. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>London. Yesterday, the British Air Ministry issued a communiqué stating that on Wednesday night, British aircraft attacked factories in Cologne with heavy bombs and incendiary bombs. The communiqué stated that this was a "heavy raid." The traffic lines and industrial areas east of the Rhine River were the main targets of the air raid. Due to the very good weather, the results of the bombing could be clearly observed. Several factories were hit, including a large building that was apparently set ablaze by the bombing. The communiqué also stated that oil storage tanks in Rotterdam and the Dutch airfield under German occupation were also attacked. It further stated that there were no British aircraft losses in this air raid. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e34">War Situation for the Week of March 13th to 19th <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. A military commission spokesperson discussed the war situation this week as follows:</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Guanghai, Guangdong Province, were forced to flee to their ships after being pressed by Chinese troops on the 15th. Chinese troops immediately recovered the city and captured a large amount of military supplies. As a result, there are no more traces of the Japanese within 400 kilometers of the coast in Guangdong. However, there was a small-scale battle in the Dongjiang area. On the morning of the 17th, over a thousand Japanese troops landed at Xia Yongxu and Ren Shanxu (north of Aotou), joining up with the Japanese in Danshui and advancing towards Ping Shanxu. They were intercepted separately by Chinese troops, and fierce fighting is ongoing. Furthermore, a unit of Japanese troops from Xin Jie sneaked into Huacun and Zinizhuang on the evening of the 16th. They were severely attacked by Chinese troops and fled back with injuries.</p>
<p>Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Japanese troops on the west bank of the Gan River have launched a relatively large battle. According to Japanese broadcasts, they will preemptively strike and seek to destroy a certain main force of the Chinese army. As a result, on the morning of the 15th, they launched an attack with over three thousand troops from Anyi, attacking Fengxin City on multiple routes. Another five thousand Japanese troops launched an attack on Gaoan from Xishan Wanshou Palace on the 16th. The Chinese army had already learned of the Japanese army's intentions, so they consistently avoided decisive battles with the main force and maintained the initiative. As a result, the Japanese troops sneaked into Fengxin one after another in the afternoon of the same day and then sneaked into Gaoan. To prevent the Chinese army from flanking, the Japanese also left behind a unit of over two thousand Japanese soldiers, who crossed the Jin River south from Zhutoushan on the morning of the 16th. They sneaked into Qujiang at noon. After a courageous interception by Chinese troops, a large number of Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and many Japanese soldiers were captured.</p>
<p>Hubei</p>
<p>(1) On the west bank of Yichang, on the morning of the 13th, the Chinese army completely cleared out the Japanese troops, restoring the original situation from six days prior. On the east bank, Chinese troops attacked Yaqueling, encountering Japanese troops at Liangjiagou. Although the Japanese army sent massive reinforcements from Longquanpu and other places, the Chinese army was still able to hold its ground against the Japanese army. (2) Units of the Chinese army in southern Hubei launched a joint attack on the Japanese troops in Tongcheng and its outskirts, starting at dusk on the 12th. By 2:00 AM on the 13th, the Chinese army had formally recovered Tongcheng. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed and fled north.</p>
<p>Su-Wan</p>
<p>The Chinese armies in both provinces have also had small actions. The first is the Chinese army in southern Jiangsu. At 4:00 AM on the 16th, they attacked and entered Gaoyou, annihilating many Japanese troops. The Chinese army immediately recovered the city. The Japanese army in Wuhu sent reinforcements, and the Chinese army intercepted them. The second is in central Anhui. On the afternoon of the 12th, a unit of the Chinese army attacked Wuwei. Fierce fighting continued until 11:00 AM on the 13th, when the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and collapsed. The Chinese army then recovered Wuwei County. The Japanese army in Wuhu then sent large-scale reinforcements by land and water in two routes, one from Liujia Du and one from Yuxikou, transferring to Shijian Bu. The Chinese army did not allow them to arrive, set fire to the warehouses and barracks left behind by the Japanese, and withdrew calmly, maintaining a mobile posture.</p>
<p>North China</p>
<p>The Japanese army has been quite active this week, but all of its goals have not been achieved, and the results have been failures. In Shanxi Province, on the evening of the 11th, the Chinese army attacked and entered Nan Heihumiao, south of Tianjingguan. On the morning of the 14th, another unit of the Chinese army attacked Zhoucun Town, both achieving significant victories. This is part of the anti-encirclement battle of Lingchuan.

<p>Chongqing. The Stephen brothers, Peter and John, who left their hometown of Boomslangveni in 1936 and spent most of their years in Soviet prisons, left Chongqing for Hong Kong today, two weeks later than their scheduled departure date. Before boarding the plane to leave Chongqing, the Stephen brothers told a United Press reporter that they would be sailing back to the United States. Since their release from the Urumqi prison last autumn, each of the Stephen brothers has received £25 and spent $50 borrowed from both China and the United States. They could not prove that they were American citizens, but the American authorities believe that they may be able to prove it after returning to the country and have advanced funds to cover travel expenses. The Stephen brothers said that their passports were obtained in 1936, the year they were accused of being American spies and arrested in Kamchatka. They then spent their time in prisons in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Alma-Ata, and other places, finally residing in the Urumqi prison for 27 months until their release last autumn. They traveled to Chongqing by walking, riding horses, and riding camels, arriving here several weeks ago. The Stephen brothers left Boomslangveni for the Soviet Union to observe what the truth about the Soviet Union was like. They have now learned everything about Soviet prisons. They also said that the only evidence to prove that they are American citizens is their birth certificates, which are now in Boomslangveni. Because the two brothers have lived in the Soviet Union for so long, they are now fluent in Russian. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing. Regarding the registration of Dutch government bonds and securities, the Dutch Legation issued a public notice stating that in accordance with Order No. 11 (1) dated August 23, 1940, the Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai has begun to handle the registration of Dutch government bonds and securities in Shanghai. Bondholders in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces can also go to the consulate for registration within this month. Dutch government bonds and securities in the above-mentioned areas that have not been registered before April 1 of this year will not be recognized by the Dutch government. The registration fee is two percent of the face value. The Dutch Legation can assist with registration matters. (2) The Chongqing office is located at Huanglanya (Wen Feng Tower) on the south bank.

<p>Chongqing. According to related sources, although the important salt fields along the coast have fallen one after another since the start of the war, the production of salt fields in the rear has been increasing daily after the authorities worked hard to rectify them. It has now increased from 13 million dan per year to 25 million dan. The national annual consumption is only 20 million dan, so there should be no problem with the supply and demand of salt. The only problem to be solved is transportation. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Domestically Produced Tung Oil Expected to Sell Well This Year <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. A Chongqing foreign trade expert observes that domestically produced tung oil will definitely sell well this year. Its main target is naturally the United States, because (1) the United States is manufacturing military supplies in large quantities, and tung oil is one of the main raw materials. (2) Tung tree planting in the United States is limited by climate, soil, and manpower and has reached the saturation point. Therefore, a telegram from the United States recently stated that it will actively rush to transport goods from the East. Although the items are not listed in detail, it can be asserted that tung oil must be one of them. China originally has no problems in terms of supply, but in order to prepare for the ever-increasing demand, it is necessary to strive to increase production. Currently, the Trade Commission and the Fuxing Corporation are in charge and are adopting various methods, such as loans to planting households, which is one of them, and increasing the purchase price by 15 percent, which is the main means.

However, in areas too close to the front lines, implementation will be temporarily suspended to prevent agricultural products from falling into the hands of the Japanese army. According to the plan, (1) reclaim wasteland, (2) reduce unnecessary crops, (3) promote winter plowing, (4) disseminate improved seeds, (5) improve irrigation. In addition, it is also forbidden to feed livestock with rice and wheat or to make wine with rice, wheat, millet, or sorghum. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">International Anecdotes (10) (1) The Trend of Japan's Southern Advance <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The movement of the American fleet to visit New Zealand and Australia has changed the situation in the South Pacific. This is a translation of a radiogram from the New York Times' Tokyo correspondent regarding Japan's southward policy:</p>
<p>What Germany calls "Lebensraum" is called the "Co-prosperity Sphere" in Japan.</p>
<p>What Japan calls "Greater East Asia" is an indivisible core composed of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo." Therefore, Tokyo is its center, surrounded by many vassal states and islands, forming a "solar system." Instead of calling such a thing a product of modern times, it is better to regard it as a feudal "remnant," like a monarch in the center, surrounded by vassals, offering annual tributes to repay the kindness of protection from the superior country. However, this kind of protection is given regardless of whether people need it or not.</p>
<p>When explaining the Greater East Asia policy, Japanese politicians always emphasize economic benefits. For example, former Foreign Minister Arita, following in the footsteps of famous "utopian" theorists, declared that the world should be re-divided into several units with equal military and economic power to achieve lasting peace.</p>
<p>There are also other "prophets" who see other benefits. For example, Rear Admiral Ishimaru of the Japanese Navy once said that Japan can thus obtain an important strategic position, giving small countries the security of a fortified city.</p>
<p>The development of air power over the past year has turned Japan's 2,500 small islands scattered in the Pacific Ocean into a fixed aircraft carrier, extending Japan's influence into the Pacific Ocean, blocking the United States and the Philippines, and leaving Pearl Harbor in Hawaii even closer by two thousand miles. These many islands have been called stepping stones to the Dutch East Indies. In fact, in the age of aviation, seaplanes can dock in their lagoons, making them a foothold. Air forces based on the above-mentioned islands, cooperating with Japanese warships, will make things difficult for the British-Chinese joint fleet.</p>
<p>These many islands have little economic value, but under Japanese management, they are not losing money. Strategically speaking, they surround the abundant tropical islands, forming an impenetrable barrier (the rubber, oil, tin, and nickel produced on these tropical islands can make Japan a militarily self-sufficient country). Their position also cuts across the main routes of the American fleet to these abundant islands and the Asian continent, so they occupy an important position in the Japanese military plan.</p>
<p>According to former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Navy, Admiral Suetsugu, if a fleet is based on American territory, there are only three routes to approach Japan. The most favorable route for combat is via San Francisco, Hawaii, Midway Island, Guam, and the Philippines. However, Japan already has strong defenses on this route, and any fleet taking this route will inevitably fall into a trap.</p>
<p>The northern route from Alaska via the Aleutian Islands cannot be used on a large scale due to the heavy fog. Therefore, Admiral Suetsugu believes that the American fleet's strategy will inevitably take the southern route via Hawaii, Australia, and the British naval base of Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore is the key to the overall situation and the target of Japan's recent strategic actions. It is located on the outer edge of the South Seas, 2,890 miles from Tokyo, a great distance, like Gibraltar to New York, but it is still an important military obstacle to Japan's southward policy. Singapore controls the throat of all transportation between Europe and the Far East, is close to the Dutch East Indies, is only 1,550 miles from Manila, and is a transportation hub between Australia, New Zealand, and the British Empire.</p>
<p>Any country that occupies Singapore can grasp its entire transportation and have absolute control over the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Britain has greatly strengthened Singapore's defenses in the past fifteen years. Singapore can now accommodate the largest battleships and can be used as an air force base. The commander-in-chief is an air force general, and a large army is under his command. Singapore is impregnable by sea, but there is a risk of being attacked by enemy troops from the Malay Peninsula. However, its greatest threat is in air raids.</p>
<p>Japan's nearest base to Singapore has always been far away, over two thousand miles away. However, the country's navy has recently advanced southward twice. In the spring of 1939, Japan occupied Hainan Island, the southernmost territory of China. Later, the Japanese government announced that the Spratly Islands, an uninhabited coral reef located on the South China Sea traffic route, would be administered by the Taiwan authorities, and the Governor-General of Taiwan is a serving Japanese navy admiral.</p>
<p>Hainan is a large island that can accommodate the concentration of large armies. The Spratly Islands are an unknown area on earth, consisting of ninety-six small islands that barely protrude above the sea. The islands produce turtles, birds, and sharks.</p>
<p>All ships sailing in the South China Sea regard this group of coral reefs as a danger, but the Japanese navy has thoroughly explored them, and Japanese ships can pass unimpeded and take shelter from storms in the lagoons. With this island in their grasp, it became the vanguard of the Japanese navy's southward advance, 2,500 miles from Japan and only 800 miles from Singapore.</p>
<p>But these many gains are dwarfed by the surrender of France. Cam Ranh Bay on the southeast coast of Vietnam is an important natural harbor. Saigon, where Japanese warships arrived, is only 750 miles from Singapore. Japan's pressure on Vietnam is partly due to the urgency of the war against China and partly a part of its southward advance.</p>
<p>In this area, if one wants to change the status quo by force, Singapore is the only major military obstacle. The points of attack on Singapore are now becoming closer than the points of aid to Singapore. Singapore is the only base in the Western Pacific that can accommodate a large fleet.</p>
<p>British naval expert Beyers wrote a summary of the entire situation: "If Japan is determined to go to war with Britain, it will suddenly attack Singapore with all its strength. Once this strong fortress falls, victory can be assured. Capturing Singapore is, of course, a simpler task than invading Australia."</p>

<h3 id="e60">Grain, Hoarding Tigers' Arrogance Gradually Wanes, Foreign Rice Continues to Show Flat and Weak Status <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice hoarders came out of the cage yesterday, and the market has seen a reactionary decline. The rice price has already reached its highest peak, and new hoarders dare not inquire again. The investment silver money gangs are also afraid of the market price falling and come out of the cage with the market. Moreover, the 80,000 bags of rice stored in the public warehouse have already been ordered by the joint foreign firm and are being expedited to be loaded. Although the new order is rare, the place of origin is being loaded with the wheel, and with this unfavorable environment for buyers, the market immediately reacted and fell sharply. However, some large households still want to stick to long-term storage in order to make a final struggle and hope that there will be new changes to realize their dream of getting rich. However, under the deep resentment of the citizens and the accusations of everyone, they may not be able to follow their wishes. Foreign rice was already weak in the morning market, and the black market price has fallen. In the afternoon, the selling wind was very strong, and the decline was fierce. The morning market has fallen by two yuan, and the afternoon market has fallen further. In the afternoon, it fell by five or six yuan. The small price of special goods for the morning market is still 4,100 yuan and 4,000 yuan for every 100 bags. The big market goods are 3,7800 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell to 3,200 yuan. Although the afternoon market of Saigon No. 1 and other goods was not opened, the asking price was 2,500 yuan less. In the morning, the Saigon No. 1 premium was 3,400 yuan to 3,200 yuan, No. 2 premium was 3,550 yuan, Siam Miscellaneous No. 2 was 3,600 yuan, and broken rice was 2,700 yuan to 2,500 yuan. The transaction volume for the whole day was 7,8000 bags.</p>
<p>The continuous import of foreign rice has been reported in previous reports. The Taigongsi Qiongzhou wheel arrived at the port in the evening a few days ago (20th), carrying 4,004 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the Yuezhou wheel also loaded 1,363 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at the wharf of this firm in Pudong for unloading. It is heard that Jardine Matheson's Risheng wheel will arrive in Shanghai today with a large number of foreign rice and foreign flour loaded from Hong Kong. The exact number will be reported later. (Zu)</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice has suddenly turned sparse. Although store sales are not smooth, the owners' intention to sell is very firm. Under the support of not being willing to easily sell, the market price is relying on holding, showing a stable situation. If the Changbang special white japonica rice price is still 127 yuan and a half to 126 yuan, Kunshan rice is 1245 yuan, next to 120 yuan, the original bag is 126 yuan, Qingjiao rice thin rice is 115 yuan, 114 yuan, the original bag is 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, because the raw rice market has been weak for several days, those who hold the goods are thinking about making a living and are coming out of the cage quite a lot. However, the sales market has turned sluggish, so the supply exceeds demand, the market is difficult to maintain, and it has fallen by two or three yuan. The opening price of Hong Kong special yuan is 107 yuan, the ordinary price is 105 yuan, the second-rate goods cannot be opened, and there is no market.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Foreign Flour Arrives in Succession <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The price of flour has been falling, mainly because the goods transshipped from Hong Kong have arrived one after another, reaching about 100,000 bags in a few days. Foreign firms are also throwing out flour. With the international situation easing slightly and the price of rice falling back, people's hearts are naturally weak, and scattered retail investors are quite willing to sell. However, the handlers of the goods intend to hold on, so there is not much current stock circulating in the market, and the selling price is already showing signs of being unable to support it and falling. Today, the market price of Australian flour of the Flower Bird Clock Tower brand is 31 yuan and 34 angles, and the price of Cambodian flour of the Golden Dragon brand is 30 yuan and 012 angles. The actual sales are all customs-cleared, so the market is gradually trending towards a holding state. The flat-selling flour of the Chinese factory is still 25 yuan, supplied by Fuxin Factory with more than 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>There is nothing to hold on to for wheat, mainly because the national wheat in stock has been exhausted, and the market is almost completely out of circulation. Except for occasional sporadic purchases by Japanese flour mills, there are no whole-lot transactions. It is heard that the selling price of Gao Du wheat is still 456 yuan, and there is no change for the time being.</p>

At that time, Hong Kong Telecom suddenly bought the foreign firm's US dollar for this month at 5 yuan 4375, but soon the Oriental Credit Bank suddenly bought more than 200,000 US dollars (it is said that it was entrusted by a certain rice foreign firm), so the market trend was flat.

<p>Boiled Red Squeeze Small 30 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, because people's hearts were empty and tired, there were quite a few who were willing to sell according to the opening price, but there were few buyers, so the opening price was suppressed by 10 yuan, which was 6,370 yuan. Then it was made 2 yuan small, reaching 6,368 yuan. At that time, Xianghe aggressively entered, and Chengji Xin Yuan also followed suit, and they rose to 6,385 yuan together.

<p>The yarn market is slightly weak, and the trend is still uncertain. This is due to fierce contention between bulls and bears. In actual trading, Hong Kong buyers showed increased demand for Double Horse yarn. Due to the mills' efforts to promote sales with subsidies and incentives, customer interest was aroused, so sales were active, but prices were very low. There are differing views on this matter among bulls and bears. Bears say that the mills' subsidy of 60-70 yuan means the actual price is cheap, only selling for 1320-30 yuan. Bulls say that this will reduce inventories and be beneficial. The high price for 20-count yarn was 1415 yuan, and the low price was 1396 yuan. Initial trading in the afternoon was at 1412 yuan, then suddenly fell to 1385 yuan, with the final price at 1386.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Double Horse yarn market opened with ordinary conditions. The initial price was 1412 yuan, then slightly rose to 1414 yuan.

<p>The spot cotton situation is gradually improving. Chinese mills such as Rongfeng are starting to purchase raw materials for coarse yarn. At the same time, cotton brokers are increasingly excited to trade, so the market is rising. However, American cotton is turning downwards. Transaction prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose due to buying by traders, then fell due to profit-taking by foreign firms and selling by Southern brokers. As a result, closing prices were 11 to 21 points lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market first fell due to selling, then rebounded due to short covering and buying by traders. Yesterday's closing prices were about 6 rupees higher for Pingal and Yamla, except for White Locke, which was flat. Yesterday's forecast fell by 1.5 rupees compared to the closing prices.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading is still lively, and market conditions are gradually firming. This is because the city's raw cotton inventory is low, and the situation is actually favorable for purchases by various traders. There has been small-scale purchasing by all parties in recent days. Brazilian cotton has seen large-scale transactions.</p>

White cloth prices fluctuated within a narrow range, only one or two jiao. As a result, all prices showed little change from the previous day. Dark-colored fine yarn fabrics saw rising prices as inventory holders actively sought them. However, light-colored fine yarn goods were restricted by sales orders, and despite increased costs, they showed no ability to rise. The street saw transactions of over 500 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang-Taiwanese buyers purchased 100+ pieces of Fushi and Dapeng fine cloth and Yihe coarse cloth. Guangdong-Hong Kong buyers purchased almost 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and melton. 625 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 22nd.

<p>Since the unrest started on the ninth of last month, wholesale sales of local mill goods have been suspended. Although sales have now resumed, prices are rising day and night, even more so than during last year's dramatic exchange rate fluctuations. Chessboard and Dalu brokers are hoarding all local mill goods for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, refusing to sell them in full quantities. Brokers who sell samples have also issued notices stating that sample prices will be raised by 10% effective immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Continues to Rise <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market trend remained tight yesterday. A few hundred tons of Dutch raw white sugar for April shipment C.I.F. traded at US$5.45. The Association set the following prices: Spot 24 raw white sugar was 83.25 yuan at local warehouses, up 1.50 yuan; 82.67, 82.8, 83 yuan, 83.1 at outside warehouses. End of March was 82.8, 83, 83.2, 83.3, April 10th documentation was 83.1, 83.3, 83.5, 83.65 yuan, all up 0.55 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 65 yuan to 65.10 yuan, up 0.3 yuan.

<h3 id="e70">Coal: Only Heard Prices, No Transactions, Bituminous Coal Hits Repeated Highs <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the coal market has been rising steadily. Market sentiment is intoxicated and crazy. Regardless of bituminous coal, white coal, high, secondary, and various other grades, everyone is simply snatching it up without selling, resulting in repeated highs. Only prices are heard, and no transactions are seen. It has reached a situation of "priced but unsold". Yesterday, Kaiping bituminous coal lump was being quoted at 290 yuan per ton, and No. 2 slack was 220 yuan, but there was no spot supply. Therefore, the prices quoted by the street's coal dealers varied widely and were extremely chaotic.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Shanghai Municipal Council Officially Announces: No Fear of Rice Shortage in Shanghai; Warehouses Stock Over 800,000 Bags; Sufficient Inventory, All Sectors Need Not Panic; Constant Rice Arrivals, Speculators Release Holdings <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's rice reserves are becoming increasingly full, and there is no shortage in the future. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee yesterday. The committee's rice reserve survey for this period (from last Thursday to this Thursday) was completed yesterday. All Chinese and foreign warehouses in the city had a total of 800,2905 bags of grain. The Bank of China warehouse had the most, with 57249 bags, followed by the Taikoo Company warehouse, with 56345 bags, the Longmao warehouse third, with 54299 bags, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse fourth, with 51186 bags. Others such as Gonghexing and Shuntai all had more than 10,000 bags. The above rice reserves are limited to Chinese and foreign warehouses. As for rice shops' sales and storage, citizens' purchases and stockpiling, and various food groups' purchased and shipped rice, those responsible for the committee estimated yesterday that the reserves also reached over 500,000 bags, up to 600,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of rice in the city reaches about 1.5 million bags. At a consumption rate of 10,000 bags per day, the above rice reserves are enough for the city's four million residents for five months. Therefore, the abundance of the city's rice reserves is undeniable.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Announcement: No Need to Panic</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Rice and Bean Industry Association on the 19th of this month, as of the same date, the total rice reserves in warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, and south of Suzhou Creek, the Public Concession, and the French Concession totaled 802,905 bags, an increase of 77,594 bags from the report a week earlier. It can be seen that the city's rice reserves are increasing, not decreasing, and there is no fear of a shortage. All sectors need not panic.</p>
<p>Public Warehouse Rice Purchase: 80,000 Bags</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Public Warehouse Committee decided this Wednesday to first order 80,000 bags of stored rice to be shipped to Shanghai for storage to stabilize rice prices. Yesterday, it was learned that the ordering procedures were agreed upon a few days ago, with the price of each bag of Xiaowen rice being 100 yuan. They are expected to arrive in the city by the middle of next month. At that time, the city's rice prices should become more stable.</p>
<p>Supply Congestion: Speculators Sell Off</p>
<p>In recent days, the source of foreign rice has poured into the city. According to news from the foreign firms in the city, (1) the French cargo ship Sarraut, managed by the Hualun Foreign Firm, is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. At that time, the ship will dock at the Lao Gongmao Wharf in Pudong. The ship is carrying 25,000 bags of rice. (2) The French postal ship "Great Da Nang" is expected to arrive here from Saigon on the 25th of this month. At that time, the ship will dock at the Blue Funnel Wharf. The ship is carrying 70,000 bags of rice. It is said that once the unloading is completed, the ship will continue to export, loading foreign rice to Shanghai. In this environment of abundant arrivals, speculators, fearing a sharp drop in rice prices, have sold off their holdings one after another. Yesterday, the rice market traded more stably, and sentiment was very weak. As a result, the black market "discount" fell by 200-300 yuan compared to the previous market price. It is reported that the release of these stockpiled rice has allowed speculators to make substantial profits, each bag being about 50-60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Yu's Rice Account: Three Household Names <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency says that in Mr. Yu Qiaqing's recent announcement of his private rice account, there were three names: Zhao Qingji, Shenji, and Zhang Yuji. There has been much speculation about this. In fact, Zhao Qingji is Zhao Qinglan, chairman of the Rice Broker Association. Shenji is the Shenji Rice Firm on the floor of the Oriental Huili Bank on Beijing Road. Zhang Wangji is Zhang Yushu, manager of Tongmao Xinyi Rice Firm. All of them are retailers who resell to rice shops. At that time, it was limited by the space in the advertisement, so it could not be explained in detail.</p>
<p>Food Association: Notifies Subscribers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Cooperative Association yesterday notified all subscribers that (1) 748 households totaling 4,000+ bags entrusted to the Association to purchase foreign rice from January 9th to February 20th this year have already been purchased in four batches and distributed to the subscribers. In the week from February 21st to March 1st, another 200 households with a total of 911 bags were added. In the two weeks from March 3rd to March 15th, another 1049 households with a total of 549 bags were added. A total of 1,200+ households with 6,000+ bags have not yet been purchased. (2) The reason for the temporary failure to purchase foreign rice is not the lack of foreign rice abroad (Saigon, Yangon, and Java all have large quantities of foreign rice waiting to be purchased), but because all the ships that can transport rice have been raised in price and chartered out, so legitimate foreign rice firms cannot rent ships. (3) Foreign rice can be expected to be purchased soon, because after April, rice transport ships can be expected to be rented, and foreign firms can also be expected to purchase. (4) If subscribers need rice to cook and cannot wait one or two months, they can bring their original receipt to the Association to apply for a refund of their foreign rice deposit. Those who wish to wait will be notified by letter when the foreign rice is purchased. (5) The Association is still continuing to process registrations, but there will be some difficulty in the short term.</p>
<p>Yesterday Another Rice Grab Occurred</p>
<p>Since rice prices have been high, many poor people have nothing to cook, resulting in rice grabbing incidents. A reporter passed through the intersection of Longmen Road and Racecourse Road yesterday and witnessed two bags of rice piled on a small cart. As the carter was pushing the cart forward, seven or eight poor people suddenly rushed out of the alley, rushed forward, cut the rice bags with knives, and snatched away half a dan. After the incident was investigated, the rice belonged to Xielongsheng on Bubier Road. According to someone from the rice association, rice grabbing incidents among colleagues are reported daily, especially in the slums of Xinzha Road and western Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e74">French Electric Company Strike Expected to Resolve Today; Water and Electricity Workers Also Joined the Strike Yesterday; Anglo-Chinese Tram Labor and Management Began Negotiations <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The more than 400 workers of the French Electric Company, who jointly went on strike on the 19th of this month, have not yet heard of a resolution as of last night's press time. It was also learned that the company's water and electricity workers also joined the strike at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, so the situation is quite serious. The Anglo-Chinese Shanghai Tram Company workers submitted 12 conditions, which the company considered, and negotiated once at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>French Electric Company Mediation Expected to Resolve</p>
<p>After all the workers of the French Electric Company jointly went on strike on the 19th, the French Concession Political Department and others advised the workers to resume work first and wait for a reasonable mediation and resolution. They also sent personnel to discuss the resolution with the company's managers yesterday afternoon. Regarding the four conditions, the company agreed to consider them. However, the company believed that it was very difficult to go back on its word on the third article, the reinstatement of dismissed workers, so it did not agree to consider it. The Political Department believes that although labor and management are not in harmony, they are close to each other, so it is now doing its best to seek a quick resolution. It was heard yesterday morning around 10:00 a.m. that the labor side held another general meeting in the South City to discuss coping methods. The content is unknown, but according to news from the Society News Agency yesterday evening, the labor and management negotiations of the French Electric Company have made further progress. At the same time, a certain party will exert pressure on the labor side to first resume work and then discuss the conditions, so it is generally believed that the labor unrest is expected to be resolved today and will not be delayed. It is said that the French Electric Company's various vehicles will resume operation first today.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Workers Join the Strike</p>
<p>According to an inquiry by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the French Water and Electric Company has been four days since the workers of the tram department jointly went on strike on the 19th. Although the French Concession authorities tried to mediate, the opinions of labor and management were opposed, and they were still at a standstill as of last night. All the workers in the company's water and electricity departments also joined the strike yesterday morning because they requested an increase in wages. However, according to the company's manager Foflai, the supply of tap water in the French Concession will not be affected, because the company hired a number of Russian workers in advance, who can continue to drive and produce water. Residents of the French Concession should not panic.</p>
<p>Strict Protection in the Parking Lot</p>
<p>The French Concession's various tramcars, trolleybuses, and buses remained out of service yesterday morning. All vehicles were parked in the Lveban Road factory, and armed detectives were stationed around the area to protect them. Obstacles such as wire mesh racks were also placed to prevent them. However, residents in the French Concession were deeply inconvenienced due to the transportation stoppage and hoped for an early resolution to maintain public transportation. However, yesterday evening, the company's relevant departments revealed that tram ticket inspectors could go on duty today, so it is not yet known whether the vehicles will resume operation today.</p>
<p>Anglo-Chinese Electric Tram Negotiated Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the 12 conditions submitted by the workers of the Public Concession Tram Company, labor and management had a negotiation once at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The labor side stated that if the requested requirements were not fully met, it would take appropriate action. One of the conditions required that the management agree to the "union" participating in the company's administration and fully recognize the "union," which has become quite problematic. It is said that the management will refuse to accept it. According to the company's manager Ivan yesterday, the labor's request for a salary increase is not 150%, and what was announced yesterday was inaccurate, but he refused to disclose the correct amount and did not allow the detailed announcement of the conditions submitted by the workers.</p>

<p>Regarding the Anglo-Chinese Tap Electricity Company's application to reduce tap electricity consumption, the Municipal Council will negotiate with the French Concession Municipal Authorities, and the measures can be announced soon. It is expected that the results of the negotiations, any measures that will be taken to restrict the supply of tap electricity, will be implemented jointly in the Public Concession and the French Concession. There are also many tap electricity users in the French Concession. It is heard that one of the issues considered by the Municipal Council Board of Directors at its meeting on Wednesday was whether to supply tap electricity to new users.</p>
<p>Household Users Most Affected</p>
<p>It is heard from well-informed sources that the Anglo-Chinese Tap Electricity Company, due to its inability to obtain the required amount of coal, has submitted a plan to the Municipal Council to reduce tap electricity consumption, which has been approved by the Municipal Council. It is heard that the details of this plan are being formulated by the Bureau in conjunction with the Tap Electricity Company. The Municipal Council stated that it will issue a message about this plan in a few days. As the city's factories consume only a small amount of tap electricity, it is expected that household users will be most affected by this plan.</p>

<p>The National Medical Civilian Hospital is purely for the purpose of helping the poor and sick. There are about two to three hundred outpatients every day and more than one hundred inpatients. According to annual statistics, it can save and treat about 100,000 poor and sick people. Each inpatient needs 2-3 yuan per day for medicine and food expenses. The total monthly expenses require more than 7,000 yuan. Since its establishment, nine months have passed in an instant. All income and expenses have been published in the newspaper. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society and those who promote national medicine and Chinese medicine will consider that it has no foundation and make generous donations to help. Then the poor and sick will be able to receive assistance, and the hospital affairs will be able to be maintained.</p>

<p>Pain sometimes gives us a lot of trouble. When we have a little pain, we will make the wrong decisions, suffer serious losses in business, and be unable to express our opinions at meetings. As for the social world, it is even more harmful. When making appointments, we have to cancel our appointments temporarily.</p>
<p>In the family, pain is also not allowed to exist. If a housewife suffers from menstrual pain, then family life is full of suffering. The children are just deliberately making trouble. When the husband returns home, he sees his wife sleeping in bed, and a sense of helplessness arises. Therefore, pain is enough to affect our physical health and indirectly enough to affect the safety of the entire society.</p>
<p>However, we do not have to endure pain, because as long as we take one or two tablets of Sanlitong, the pain will stop within ten minutes. It is absolutely safe. No matter which part has a little pain, Sanlitong is the supreme remedy.</p>

<p>At about 8:15 yesterday morning, a murder case occurred in front of the Deshengchang cigarette and paper shop at the mouth of Hongxiang Lane on Xinzha Road, west of Yuqiaqing Road. The victim was Lou Dong, who was shot in the head. He fell to the ground at that time. When the police heard the sound and rushed to the scene, the shooter was nowhere to be seen. They took the injured person to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died of his injuries on the way. The various details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shot When Leaving Home</p>
<p>It was found that the person who was shot and killed was named Lou Dong, styled Tianquan, and also known as Hanmin. He was from Hangzhou, 62 years old, and currently works at the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank at No. 15 The Bund as the director of the Investigation Department. He lives at No. 62 Hongxiang Lane on Xinzha Road. He got up at dawn, finished breakfast, and walked out of the alley. He was taking a cigarette and lighting a fire at the counter of the Deshengchang cigarette and paper shop at the eastern end of the alley when a man suddenly jumped out from behind him, drew a pistol, and opened fire on Lou.</p>
<p>Bullet Hits the Head</p>
<p>A total of two shots were fired at the time. Lou was caught off guard and was shot in the head. The bullet entered from the back of his head and pierced through his forehead. He immediately fell to the ground with a thud, blood flowing out. He could no longer speak. The patrolling officer heard the sound and rushed to the scene of the incident, but did not know who the shooter was. They summoned an ambulance to take him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died on the way due to serious injuries. The detectives found several business cards next to him and learned his real name.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Deceased</p>
<p>It is heard that Lou's experience: He was a scholar in the former Qing Dynasty and had served in the Ministry of Finance of the National Government. After the National Army moved west, he transferred to Shanghai. He knew a little about the skills of Qihuang, so he also once practiced medicine. During the "Renovation," he served as Liang Hongzhi's secretary. After that, he changed to serve as the "Director of the General Affairs Section of the Ministry of Finance" and the "Director of the Ministry of Military Affairs." When the "Shanghai Reserve Bank" was established, he was transferred to this position. This time, he was suddenly murdered, and it is believed that it was a political relationship.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Japan's Plot to End the War: Another Bubble That Will Burst: Western Newspaper Says Sino-Japanese War Has Entered Final Stage <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>An editorial in the English-language *China Press* stated that although the Sino-Japanese War has entered its 45th month, Japan's attempt to reach a compromise with Chongqing to end the Sino-Japanese "undeclared war" is another bubble floating on the surface of the Far East. Because such efforts by the Japanese are similar to bubbles, it can be confidently asserted that this bubble will ultimately disappear without a trace. Everyone, including Japanese soldiers, admits that Japan is eager to end the current war to catch its breath. Therefore, the only question in the minds of the Japanese now is how to conclude the war without an "obvious defeat."</p>
<p>**Improving Situation, Increasing Strength**</p>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong, Japanese officers will attempt to negotiate peace with China in late April after the Konoe Cabinet collapses. It is reported that the terms will be very "generous." However, onlookers, upon hearing this news, will immediately ask what "generous" actually means. Recalling that three years ago, when the Chinese army was gradually retreating inland and foreign aid was woefully inadequate, Chiang Kai-shek refused to sue for peace with Japan. Now that the Chinese military situation has improved, its strength has increased, and foreign aid is constantly arriving, one can imagine how firm its attitude towards Japan will be.</p>
<p>**Final Round: How to Stop Fighting?**</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese boxing match has entered the fifteenth round (the final round). China has endured the opponent's fierce attacks in the past fourteen rounds. Now the opponent's strength has gradually weakened due to the intense fighting. Under these circumstances, China is naturally unwilling to stop. Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Guo Taiqi, addressed this question in a speech yesterday. Ambassador Guo said, "I can assure you that China will not listen to any peace proposal, no matter how attractive it may seem, if its purpose is to allow Japan to escape the mire late and engage in aggression elsewhere." Japan is reaping what it has sown. It will be difficult for it to succeed if it tries to shift the blame to others.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Coal Prices Soar Endlessly: Boiled Water Prices Increase: Temporarily Selling at Two Cents per Ladle <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since all types of bituminous and anthracite coal have been manipulated and monopolized by speculative coal brokers and major coal companies, market prices have skyrocketed. The highest price has now been raised to a new record of 300 yuan per ton, and the upward trend continues. However, the source of foreign coal has not been interrupted. Although ships are slightly scarce, the number arriving each day, in addition to supplying the market, is said to still be able to be stored in warehouses, and the reserves are abundant, so there is no danger of shortage. The current stock of bituminous and anthracite coal in Shanghai is sufficient for the city's factories, ships, residents, etc., for four months of consumption. Therefore, the soaring price of coal is entirely due to the manipulation and monopolization by speculative coal brokers and a few large coal companies. These people are harboring ulterior motives and are still wreaking havoc on the market, attempting to continue to raise prices, which is extremely hateful. Since the Coal Industry Association obtained approval from the Mining Bureau to raise the price of cheap No. 3 coal dust from 70 yuan to 80 yuan per ton from the previous period, the daily expenses of the boiled water and bathhouse industries have increased. Moreover, at a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cassia, business operations are particularly difficult. It is now known that the owners of the 503 boiled water shops in the city, in view of the repeated price increases of cheap coal, feel that their daily income is insufficient to cover their expenses. Although they have repeatedly advocated not raising prices in order to protect the livelihood of the common people and uphold the government's intention to keep prices stable, this time they have been forced to do so. Therefore, they have jointly decided to moderately increase the price of boiled water from the 20th of this month. The announcement is excerpted as follows: "Due to rising prices and high expenses, business operations are experiencing difficulties. After discussion among the industry, it has been decided to temporarily sell boiled water at two cents per ladle from today onwards. No unauthorized increases or decreases are allowed.

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the recovery of Shanghai by the National Revolutionary Army. All sectors recalled that on this day in 1927, the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, and the army and people cooperated to recover the area. Now, good news is frequently reported from various places, and the international situation is increasingly favorable to China. The citizens of the city, celebrating the glorious festival, unanimously made enthusiastic celebrations in an excited mood, but did not hold a commemorative ceremony. In order to continue to promote glorious historical achievements, all sectors strengthened their belief in supporting national policies, worked hard to move forward, completed the great cause of national rejuvenation, and continued to promote the movement of thrift, donation, and bond purchase to meet the needs of national construction and fulfill national responsibilities. The authorities of the concessions took strict precautions throughout the day yesterday, sending additional detectives to patrol and inspect the roads to prevent incidents.</p>
<h3 id="e88">British, American, and Japanese Consuls Suggest That the Board Elections Be Postponed: So That the Current Negotiations Can Be Discussed at Length: British and Americans Advocate That the Previous Board Members Be Re-elected <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to information obtained from reliable sources yesterday, the British, American, and Japanese sides in the city have submitted a request to the Consular Body, hoping that the annual election of the Municipal Council, originally scheduled for April 23, can be postponed to between April 18 and April 20, so that the current negotiations can be discussed at length. It is reported that the Consular Body is currently considering this matter and may issue a public announcement in the next two days. Although officials do not know whether the Consular Body will approve this move, other parties universally believe that the Consular Body will approve this request. According to inquiries last night, the current negotiations between the British, American, and Japanese sides suggest that the members of the previous Board be re-elected for another year, and that no elections be held this year. In addition, it is not possible to find out what other issues are being discussed. These negotiations are being conducted "cautiously" by the consuls-general of the countries concerned. It is reported that the opinions of the Japanese community are not consistent on this issue. The British community has declared that the British side has decided to put forward current British Board member as a candidate for the Board. Therefore, unless the new decision can guarantee the interests of our people, we will resolutely oppose the Japanese attempt to increase the number of Board seats.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Spring Stroll <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Shengan</p>
<p>"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Everyone shouted this, and sure enough, the snow finally "came late" and only perfunctorily appeared in mid-February, like the opium den of the poet who asked, "Can you drink a cup of wine with me?" But the weather is still spring, and looking out the window, the roof tiles are not white, so it's still impossible to "write" a poem. In fact, the numbers published by the Pushan Mountain Villa are already sigh-inducing, and besides "crazy" people, who can still be inspired to "write poetry"!</p>
<p>People like me who are still waiting now are naturally lucky, because we have escaped the "bones frozen to death on the road" and have seen the singing birds, fragrant flowers, gentle breeze, and warm sunshine of spring, so we can't help but take a stroll to celebrate. But this "celebration" is a metaphor, like someone who has committed murder but is once "acquitted." Although the judge is muddled, there is still an infinite sense of apology in the soul.</p>
<p>The problem is not only the inner guilt, but also the external pressure. Spring will not be any different from winter. If a doctor wants to take a stroll, wearing a short jacket is naturally fine (if you're looking for plum blossoms in the snow, then you need to wear a fur robe, and a red silk hood and a weak donkey are indispensable; it would be even better to have a pageboy). But you still have to put something in your stomach. To put it plainly, you have to eat your own fill even if you're minding other people's business. Isn't that clear enough? Rice needs to be cooked in white rice, and the price of white rice has exceeded 120 yuan! So it's said to be lucky, but it's not that much luckier than being unlucky.</p>
<p>Besides, last winter there were still some "philanthropists" holding cheap sales, wearing a tattered Western suit and squeezing into the long snake line. Sure enough, they couldn't show their face (and people weren't necessarily happy to see your poor face!). But this world is ranked by "money." The so-called "valuing clothes over people" is a small thing compared to a surge of resentment. I don't see the young master with his towering hair and neat Western suit planning to kidnap the "old man" or sign a double bill for "waiting for his father's natural lifespan." A tattered Western suit doesn't give a damn about "face"! Alas, when spring comes, that's when you're out of luck! Those who were seeing off the dead have seen them off, and those who weren't dead seem to have already been "successfully rescued." The long snake line gets longer and longer, but the cheap rice becomes less and less, even taking money to exchange for "nothing"! Is there really any rice? The newspapers said it came in 100,000 bags, 100,000 bags, which really confused me. But the "nothing" of the money is real!</p>
<p>So the soap is "gone"! The matches are "gone"! …"Gone"! "Gone"!</p>
<p>Spring has come. Alas! Alas! Naturally, poor people don't look rich, and dogs don't spit out ivory. If you open your eyes and look again, spring has not failed the old masters, ladies, young masters, and grandmothers, just as winter has not treated them badly.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of ships, increased water freight, and soaring rice prices (ah! rice again!), the latest high-class fabrics from London have arrived in Shanghai as scheduled. The 1941 eight-cylinder ×× (I forgot the name) car is also on display in the large, large, glass-windowed, carpeted showroom. Although the price has been changed to U.S. dollars, isn't the foreign exchange you're grabbing also U.S. dollars? So:</p>
<p>"Spring has come!" A song came from the radio, and the "isolated island" was filled with a warm atmosphere, as lovely as the faint snoring of a little pug in your arms.</p>
<p>Whether it is winter or spring, these two absolute lineups are running in absolute directions, getting further and further apart. In other words, those with more money get more, and those with less get less!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the threat to life is the same for both sides: the poor freeze to death, starve to death, hang themselves…; the rich, well—kidnapping! At once, it's 180,000, and the guards are still conscientious. Otherwise, one ripped ticket and you can't even get the "whole body" that the Chinese are most superstitious about! Amen!</p>

<p>Last year, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai raised donations for disaster relief in the Ningbo region. However, due to shipping disruptions, the disaster relief was suspended, and the association allocated a portion of the donations, totaling 340,000 yuan, to various counties in the Ningbo region for disaster relief. As the famine in various parts of Duobo has become more severe since the beginning of spring, various counties have requested disaster relief. The association specifically convened a disaster relief committee yesterday afternoon, chaired by Qin Runqing, and resolved to allocate all the remaining donations for disaster relief, except for 100,000 yuan temporarily set aside for the Ningbo office to remit water for rice, to various counties for disaster relief. The total amount is 210,000 yuan, designated for the relief of food needs in various counties and villages. Local gentry in each county are entrusted to distribute the funds fairly. The allocation is as follows: Yin County 60,000 yuan, Zhenhai 50,000 yuan, Cixi 35,000 yuan, Fenghua 30,000 yuan, Dinghai 20,000 yuan, and Xiangshan 15,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Police Authorities: Determined to Eradicate Gambling Dens: Completely Eliminated So Far: Gu Haitao of the Yin Gong Gambling Den Turns Himself In <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily*, the Public Concession Police Authorities have been vigorously cracking down on gambling for three months. Yesterday (the 20th), the police claimed that all the gambling dens in the Public Concession that had been discovered by the police had now been destroyed. This is the first time in five years. Although the police have already achieved this result, the detectives are still constantly paying attention to whether new gambling dens are being established, believing that foreigners and Chinese who run gambling dens in the Public Concession are only temporarily hiding and hoping that the police will relax their efforts in this regard.</p>
<p>**Three People Running Gambling Dens Are Wanted**</p>
<p>The Police Department is preparing to search for secret gambling dens at any time, and is also wanted the investors in various gambling dens that have been destroyed. For example, Gu Haitao (31 years old), a wealthy Chinese who set up a gambling den and provided drugs for people to use in the Yin Du Dance Palace on Foch Road No. 988, has been arrested and will be sent to the Special First Court for interrogation this morning (the 21st). The police said that Gu was the largest shareholder in the gambling den in the Yin Du Dance Palace that was destroyed last month, with an investment of more than 500,000 yuan. The other two investors are Xu Ruiyu and Zhuang Yinbao. It has been found that the above three people are all wanted by the police. Gu first fled the Public Concession, but suddenly went to the Jiangxi Road General Patrol Room to surrender last Thursday. However, we recognize that there were gambling and drug use incidents in the Yin Du Dance Palace. It is said that Xu and Zhuang are now hiding outside the Public Concession. If they enter the Concession, the police will arrest them immediately.</p>
<p>**Gambling King Intends to Take Action**</p>
<p>It is said that gambling dens in the Public Concession were extremely popular ten years ago, monopolized by a South American named Jia Xiya, so Jia was known as the "Gambling King." However, the gambling dens he set up were later destroyed. Jia recently purchased several ships in the United States and traveled between the United States and the California coast, but the gambling business he ran on the ships was also broken up by the police. He then came to Shanghai again and purchased a building in the Western Outlying Road area, with the aim of reorganizing his forces and opening a gambling den. In the past five years, gambling dens in the Public Concession have been opened and closed intermittently, and the police have admitted that at least one or two gambling dens must exist. It was not until now that they were completely eliminated.</p>

<p>— Shi Zi</p>
<p>A piece of news spread from the city to the countryside: the Fifth Great Uncle had been arrested by the grain police for hoarding grain. Thus, all members of the clan, both men and women, treated this news as something novel and passed it around.</p>
<p>The next day, a small news item was published in the Eastern Zhejiang Gazette, with the eye-catching headline: "Local Tyrant Liu ×× Hoards Grain for Profit, Yesterday Taken to the County for Punishment." My third uncle also went to the county seat to try to rescue him.</p>
<p>Liu ×× was my grandfather's sister's husband. By generation, I should call him Great Uncle; and because his wife was my fifth aunt, we juniors called him Fifth Great Uncle to distinguish him from the other four great uncles.</p>
<p>Fifth Great Uncle wrote beautiful calligraphy. He was originally a Xiucai (a successful candidate in the imperial examinations), and the locals all recognized him as a learned man. Therefore, he was extremely busy with social engagements, writing elegies, epitaphs, couplets, and tombstones for people. For the opening of a store in the countryside, it was simply unthinkable not to have a couplet written by Fifth Great Uncle. My grandfather greatly admired Fifth Great Uncle's calligraphy. I remember when I was young, Fifth Great Uncle taught me how to write calligraphy and told me the secrets of writing, the "Eight Principles of Yong," but unfortunately, I didn't pay attention, and now I've forgotten them all.</p>
<p>This reminds me of my late grandfather, who was a kind but stern man, and his temperament was very stubborn. It was rare for an opinion to stand against his and gain his tolerance; however, Fifth Great Uncle was an exception and could suggest things to my grandfather that he could not tolerate, and yet still gain his agreement. Whenever I saw Fifth Great Uncle coming in with a yellow donation book, I was never disappointed.</p>
<p>The yellow donation books were mostly for raising funds to build temples and re-gild Buddha statues, and Fifth Great Uncle loved to serve the Buddhist community. Not only that, but Fifth Great Uncle also did Buddhist rituals every day, following Buddhist rules, eating vegetarian food, chanting Buddhist scriptures, eating only two meals a day, and often talking to people about Buddhism and advising people to do good. His gentle smile and the constant twirling of his prayer beads in his hand even swayed my late grandfather, who adhered to the principle that "chanting Buddha is good for nothing, farting is good for fertilizing the fields," and he would often say that chanting Buddha was not bad, at least it was a kind of cultivation.</p>
<p>Indeed, Fifth Great Uncle's initial impression on people was that of a great philanthropist, a good man who ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddha; he was kind and willing to help others.</p>
<p>During the seven weeks of mourning after my grandfather's death, I ran into Fifth Great Uncle, who was still the same great philanthropist, with a three- or four-inch-long gray beard, twirling his prayer beads, his face full of smiles before he even opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"How is Shanghai?"</p>
<p>I told him how high the cost of living was in Shanghai, how expensive rice was, and how many people were starving to death. He nodded repeatedly and said,</p>
<p>"Shanghai is still good, Shanghai is still good. Do you know things are even worse in the countryside?" He stopped twirling his prayer beads and gestured with his hand: "Recently, every family's granary in the countryside has to be searched, and any excess grain is confiscated; what kind of talk is that? The grain is ours, the ancients said, 'Store grain to prevent famine,' is storing grain against the law? Then people will just have to starve." He remembered to twirl his prayer beads again, "The current politics are truly lawless, far worse than during the late Qing Dynasty."</p>
<p>That day, I roughly heard him talk about things "from where to begin," and not many days later, I heard that he had been found out for hoarding tens of thousands of catties of grain and had been taken to the city.</p>
<p>Immediately, this matter became a topic of conversation for the villagers; the gentry mostly sympathized with Fifth Great Uncle, some even volunteering to go to the city to find connections to rescue Fifth Great Uncle. Especially my uncles, who were running around and supporting their fifth uncle; but the general villagers were happy for a while.</p>
<p>It is said that Fifth Great Uncle, because of his diligence and hard work, plus a not-insignificant inheritance from his ancestors, was actually the richest man in the village. Therefore, many poor villagers, as well as merchants with small businesses and short of capital, borrowed money from him; and Fifth Great Uncle, based on his compassionate heart of being happy to help others, responded to every request; however, when the deadline arrived, a particularly high interest rate had to be added and paid off in full. Otherwise, he would rather spend some public funds and hire a lawyer to sue you in court. Villagers were most afraid of going to the yamen (government office), so they had to scrape together money to pay off their debts; or mortgage the next year's crops at a depreciated price. Therefore, none of the villagers who had borrowed money from him did not hate him to the bone.</p>
<p>This time, he hid the tens of thousands of catties of grain, which were compensated from the villagers in arrears over the years, using grain as collateral. At first, he also knew that his interpersonal relationships were not good, so he hid the grain in a secret place. Later, the price of grain jumped from 300 yuan to 500 yuan, so he attempted to sell the grain to others at a high price, but the matter was not kept secret, and the villagers informed on him; the next morning, the grain police, along with members of the political work team, suddenly arrived and searched out tens of thousands of catties of hoarded grain in the woodshed, and both the man and the grain were taken to the city. Many villagers secretly clapped their hands and said, "Thank God, he deserves it, eating from the poor, he's finally getting his due."</p>
<p>A few days later, Third Uncle returned from the city and heard that Fifth Great Uncle had been released, and the discovered grain had been used as low-priced rice.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, Shen Ma Zi's brothers are scheduled to come and talk to us. They want to settle the public affairs for next year, so we can consider this matter settled," Zhao Si said, looking at Begonia.</p>
<p>"I don't want to earn money from the Grand Theatre anymore!" Ma Jintao put down his opium pipe, dispiritedly. He knew that people would never ask him again, so he deliberately said it first.</p>
<p>Begonia slowly stood up from the opium couch and stretched.</p>
<p>"I'm very upset right now, let's talk about things tomorrow!" As he spoke, he lifted the door curtain, intending to step out; but after taking one step, he stopped. "Rongkui, come with me, I want to ask you something!" He turned to Rongkui alone.</p>
<p>Although he knew that this young clerk was too slick and somewhat dangerous, he had been using him for years and felt that he could not do without him.</p>
<p>Rongkui followed him to the staircase very respectfully, unable to imagine what he wanted to ask.</p>
<p>"Go downstairs and ask the accounting room if anyone has sent any letters!" Begonia instructed him in a very low voice, his face almost turning red.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Rongkui was about to go downstairs when Begonia stopped him again. "Tell them that as long as a letter comes, no matter when, bring it to me... It's a very important letter!"</p>
<p>It was most reliable to have Rongkui handle this matter that did not involve money. In a few minutes, he returned.</p>
<p>"There are no letters now, they said they would send them to you as soon as they arrive."</p>
<p>Begonia took out his glow-in-the-dark watch and glanced at it, knowing that even if Luo Xiangqi had a reply, she wouldn't send someone to deliver it at 11:00 PM. In fact, this reply only arrived from the post office on the morning of the third day, with an envelope inside an envelope, showing how careful the sender was. The letter was also very long, at least ten times longer than Begonia's letter.</p>
<p>He barely met with Zhao Si, Ma Jintao, Jin Dagezi, and the others during this morning. Xiangqi's letter, like the strongest glue in the world, firmly stuck him to a small table in front of the bed. (61)</p>

<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>In today's medicine, cancer is still one of the most difficult diseases to deal with. The reason is that the symptoms of cancer are not very obvious, and by the time the patient feels pain, it can be said to be the final dangerous signal of cancer, and treatment is quite difficult. The following are five important signals of cancer. If you find them, there is no need to be sad, and there is no need to be afraid. The most appropriate way is to calmly find a doctor with good medical skills, tell him the symptoms in detail, and ask him to perform a full body checkup. If cancer is really found, immediately administer reasonable treatment, and there is a great hope of recovery.</p>
<p>(1) A fixed lump or thickening, especially in the chest.</p>
<p>(2) Abnormal bleeding or excretion from various orifices of the body.</p>
<p>(3) Pain that cannot be cured, especially around the mouth, tongue, and lips.</p>
<p>(4) Persistent indigestion, followed by a sudden weight loss.</p>
<p>(5) A mole or wart that suddenly changes shape or rate of growth.</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e115">Sequel to "Song at Midnight" <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Ye</p>
<p>This is not a horror, supernatural, or absurd film!</p>
<p>It is a blood and tears picture of young men and women sacrificed under feudalism, a miserable cry of the oppressed, and a marching bugle of hot-blooded men!</p>
<p>Whether from the perspective of pure art or from the perspective of social value, there is no doubt that in this environment of inferior and shoddy workmanship, it is indeed a powerful work to restore reputation.</p>
<p>When Ma Xuweibang's "Diao Liushi" came out, we criticized him for his contradictions, his unreasonable catering to low tastes, even though he had some advantages, we did it for his bright future, we couldn't bear to see a spotless paper also stained with stains.</p>
<p>The song at midnight is like a sharp, long hiss; like a passionate elegy, it has been gripping our heartstrings for several years. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal positive theme, the poetic mood, the beautiful theme, the mood, the beautiful picture, we still miss it constantly.</p>
<p>The sequel "Song at Midnight" seems to be inferior to the previous one. But its subject matter is still so strong; its consciousness is still so positive, the ambition to resist. It is still overflowing in the entire continuous picture, without any pretense, without any ambiguity. From this, we can also see Ma Xuweibang's artistic conscience and serious work attitude. I hope he will continue to be so loyal and dedicated.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of the film is that there are more words than actions. It is also because of this that some shots feel slightly sluggish. If you are strictly demanding, there is too much theoretical preaching and a lack of praise for the light, this is by no means a point of deep regret.</p>
<p>The director has outstanding achievements in the angle of the lens, the placement of lights, and the splicing of film. The beauty of the picture shows his attention to composition. Photographic techniques such as fade-in, fade-out, and reprinting are also rarely seen in recent domestic films.</p>
<p>Some people say that Ma Xuweibang is one of the directors who understands film techniques and knows "montage." Indeed, he did not waste the film, and the technique is very clean. This may not be welcomed by the audience who are used to clearly explained folk films, but speaking of the entire film, it is above the general level.</p>
<p>The reasonable development of the story deeply exposes the cruelty of the feudal system, and bravely depicts the arduous process of thousands of young people vowing to fight to the death against the dark forces.</p>
<p>Liu Qiong's performance as Song Danping exceeds his previous records. Especially the section where he wanders in the village, the silent performance, is the most characteristic. He has conveyed his full of anger and hatred; even though he has some shortcomings, his hard work and seriousness make him stand out among the young actors, we hope that he will work harder!</p>
<p>Wang Zhuyou is slightly inferior to Shi Chao. The biggest shortcomings: not sad enough when sad, not handsome enough when running; the expression also tends to be stereotyped, this is entirely because there was too little imagination beforehand.</p>
<p>Tan Ying and other actors, thanks to the director's efforts, have all reached a certain level.</p>
<p>In short, in today's film industry, it can indeed be shown to the public, it is a very complete work of art!</p>

<p>After Yifang was taken over, the Xuan Palace Theatre has now been taken over by Tianfeng Company. Tianfeng Company is organized by Zhao Zhiyou, Lu Shidao, and others, and Mei Qian and others are responsible for organizing the Tianfeng Troupe.</p>
<p>Tianfeng officially starts performing today, and the first play is Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm." Because of the success of the script, "Thunderstorm" has become a famous play that is never tired of performing and never tired of watching. Therefore, Tianfeng chose this play as its first shot.</p>
<p>Tianfeng is scheduled to perform several other plays, including "Crossroads," "Gu Guan Chunqiu," "Song at Midnight," and "Ideal Wife," and others are being planned by the screenwriter and director committee.</p>

<p>Chapter Three: Makes One Recall Lord Pingyuan</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu stroked his beard and laughed: "Brother Xu, you are going to bring up heroes again. This is really needed in this situation, let's all work hard. I'm going to visit Li Xin with you today, and then I'm going to set off. I can't wait to fly to Guanwai to see what kind of person that General Wu is, and whether he can use me?" Xu Jing said: "Don't be impatient, let's have breakfast and then go immediately." So Xu Jing ordered Liu San to quickly bring up breakfast. He accompanied Zhang Cangqiu to finish breakfast, and then went to his old mother's room to pay his respects, instructed Liu San a few words, and then walked out of the door with Zhang Cangqiu and headed towards Li Family Manor. The two walked on the road and talked about Li Xin again. Zhang Cangqiu learned that Li Xin was a large household here, and also a person who was generous in helping others. Last year, when Henan was suffering from famine, Li Xin took out a lot of family wealth to help the victims, so his reputation was very high, and everyone knew him, and everyone called him Young Master Li instead of his name. Xu Jing also told him that Li Xin, in order to prevent theft, raised five fierce dogs in the manor, and at night, he removed their muzzles and let them patrol the garden. Once, six or seven bandits broke into the manor from behind the wall, intending to steal, but unexpectedly encountered these five fierce dogs, who bit them wildly, killing or wounding three of the bandits. Li Xin and others also heard the noise and came out, and the bandits had nowhere to escape and were all captured. Since then, no one dared to steal from Li Family Manor at night. Zhang Cangqiu recalled the situation of the giant dog biting last night and told Xu Jing with a smile. Xu Jing clicked his tongue and said: "How dangerous, how dangerous, probably both of you are highly skilled, so you were not injured." The two talked and walked, and soon arrived at the Li family. The front of the manor was very large. Zhang Cangqiu had entered from the back last night and had not looked closely. Now he saw that the Li Family Manor was indeed magnificent and gorgeous, and it could be said to be second to none in Qixian County. When the two arrived at the manor gate, there were already manor guards waiting there. As soon as they saw the two coming, they immediately ran inside to inform. After a while, Li Xin and Chen Zheng came out of the main gate to greet them. After meeting, Li Xin took their hands and invited them inside to sit. They went straight to the Jingxian Hall in the garden and sat down. After tea was offered, everyone talked freely about everything. Zhang Cangqiu very frankly told Li Chen and the others about his desire to wash his hands of banditry and join the army to go north. He also talked about the situation in the world. They all knew that great chaos was about to break out, the Ming Dynasty was in obvious danger, and it was difficult to predict what would happen in the future. People with ambitions would naturally have to prepare to come out and do something at this time. (18)</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Fallen Woman's Heart <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Xinde</p>
<p>If you watch this film after seeing the title "A Fallen Woman's Heart," you can at least get two novel feelings after watching it. First, Ann Sheridan, who has always been famous for playing the role of a charming woman, is the leading actress this time, but she is not playing a fallen woman. Second, Ida Lupino, who previously had mediocre results, unexpectedly achieved unprecedented success in playing the role of a fallen woman. Also, that's Humphrey Bogart not being a robber this time.</p>
<p>The above is just a digression, but it seems necessary to mention it. Because the focus of the story is placed on Ida Lupino. George Raft plays a car driver in the play, but he is also an upright man. His friend and boss's wife, Lupino, takes a fancy to him, but he resolutely rejects her love and only associates with the demure Ann Sheridan. As a result, the boss's wife has a malicious intention and kills her husband, thinking that Raft can be uninhibited from then on, but Raft still declines politely. The boss's wife has no choice but to bite back, saying that she was the one who did the poisoning, but he was the mastermind. However, when Raft was in jail, she was too stimulated, and her nerves became abnormal, so she revealed the truth, and Raft was able to escape death.</p>
<p>Although the story is somewhat similar to Pan Jinlian, because the film's role allocation is appropriate and the plot develops powerfully, it feels very tense and exciting in the performance. The whole play, from the boss's wife taking a fancy to the car driver to the madness in court, unravels step by step, making the audience have no chance to relax. Ida Lupino gives the best performance. She not only has the posture of a fallen woman, but also portrays the heart of a fallen woman. The provocative passion when she first met, and the unwillingness to give up when the good thing is not successful, still hoping for a miracle, in terms of acting, it can be said to have reached its peak. Especially the scene of madness in the courtroom is so vivid and has the overview of the whole drama. Raft plays the role of a Wu Song-type character, resolute and strong, which is also just right. Ann Sheridan may be incompatible with the character, or there are too few plays to perform, so the results are very mediocre.</p>
<p>The whole half of the play focuses on Raft and Humphrey Bogart opening a car business. Although the scenes of those car accidents are filmed very realistically, they seem to be too long. Because reducing these trivialities in front does not hinder the development of the plot. The director probably had to do this in order to allocate the roles?</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Ida Lupino was selected as the best supporting actress of the past year for playing in this film, see the picture above.)</p>
