<p>闡述外交政策及護航意見保衛美國委會促有效援華</p>
<p>華盛頓　從料羅斯福總統星期三日對游美之拉丁美利堅使命團發言時、將發表數月來關於美國外交政策之最重要言論、據若干消息靈通的國會議員之預料、美總統此次發言、將闡明現有之　　問題、而說明美國將招待以保障對英援助品安然送達之程度、因此理由、政府領袖已決定暫不在參議院發表關於護航問題之意見、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>紐約　紐約泰晤士報函報稱、羅斯福總統對於護航問題是否贊成、待至本月十四日向泛美洲聯合會發表演說時、即可分曉、緣國務赫爾、陸軍部長史汀生、海軍部長諾克斯、旣已公開聲明贊成護航之議、羅斯福總統對於一此問題、自己不能不發表意見矣、（　日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　白宮秘書歐萊昨稱、羅斯福總統熱度如常、惟因遵守醫師嚴厲指導、須繼續靜養、不能接見現時在美之丁丁美洲海軍代表、並以此深表遺憾、（十一日合眾社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　關於物資運英、以海軍護航問題及美國以海軍護航是否即等於參戰問題、此間及全國各報、均紛予以論列、孤立派人士、擁護政府派人士及主要以全力援英之人士等、日來均紛紛舉行會議、討論此事、眾料關於此事在數星期內必可有具體之決定、大多數報紙之社論、均贊助最近政府四要人所發表之援英演說、並信該四人演說之目的、在興起與論、俾便政府對歐局採取積極行事、羅斯福總統近兩週來稱病未接待記者、更引起各方之揣測、並對其下週將以何言向報界發表、亦紛紛加以推測、最近羅斯福總統又將向拉丁美洲協會發表演說、各方對之亦多加揣測、若干記者認爲、若形勢愈趨惡劣、則美國亦不致正式參戰、同時、德國亦不欲對美正式宣戰、因美國可因此而採用完全戰時體制、加緊生產、並不採取更積極之政策、上次美國之能戰勝德國、即因此故也、現此間各報不分黨派、均一致主張採取護航制度、後果如何、在所不計、惟仍有數家大報則仍贊助孤立派之主張、彼等對於林白、惠勒及奈埃諸人反對護航之言論、均一律表而彰之耳、中東部某報記者對中央社記者談、反對干預歐戰區域內之孤立派人士之意見、均已逐漸趨向擁護羅斯福外交主張之途徑、至於是否僅以海軍護航、或以全力支持民主國家爲彼等所贊同、彼謂一旦總統將其決意頒布全國、則一般民眾必予以擁護、保衛美國全國委員會七日發表宣言、主張美國立即宣告緊急狀態之存在、並利用海·空軍保衛西半球與美國間交通生命綫、該會同時主張對中國予以有效之援助、並實行對日封鎖、一面則宣布美國保衛新加坊及荷屬東印度之決心、實行封存軸心國在美存款、並以全力組成世界之永久和平云云、該委員會昨日更通過一決議案、主張美亦利用其海·空軍、以最有效之方法、保護運往抵抗侵略國家之物資、務令是項物品能到達其目的地、此外、另有「爲自由而戰委員會」、亦發表宣言、採取更積極之立塲、其宣言中有曰、吾人業已加入戰爭、故美國應立即宣告緊急狀態之存在、並立即以海軍力量將糧食及武器運往民主國集團之鬥士、一面則與各侵略國家斷絕邦交云云、（十日專電）</p>
<p>紐約　海員總工會昨已准許貨輪一艘渡太平洋條件爲以後船車如允許戰事津貼時、再行補發、至航行危險區域時、工會之要求爲海船員每日發獎金美金二元、每靠江海或亞丁海灣之海口一處時、每人給獎金美金五十元、此項要求會延緩盧肯白起、海巫及麥基斯波三船之啟航、前二船係駛往遠東、後一船往澳洲、（十一日合眾電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據昨日所發表美國航務委員會主席蘭德向參院商務委員會陳說之言論、美國水兵或海岸巡緝隊、得派登美國所沒收的外船、懸其原有國旗、駛入非戰爭區域、蘭德聲明、若干外船如懸其本國旗幟、則可租用之在海上熄燈而行、參議員樊登堡曾發問曰、君以爲船隻可懸外旗、而在美國水兵監視下行於海上乎、蘭德答曰、此當可能、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美對英船損失情形一般益見紛歧</h3>
<p>華盛頓　英海軍部發表四月份商船損失數字後、已引起此間嚴重反響、一般人對於此一問題所具意見、益見紛歧、據政界人士談稱擁護政府者、現在設法推動與論、務使政府對於派艦護送車械前往英國一項問題、早日加以決定、但按諸英海部所發表之數字、四月份該國商船僅失沉三〇一·〇七〇噸、實爲過去十一個月中最低之數字、且大半係在地中海被敵方擊沉、果然、則此一事實、似不足以加述護航辦法之決定、此輩政界人士承認、英國每月受此重大損失後、業使英國所能使用商船噸數、大爲减低、當此美國造船程序、將未能達到最高峯之際、自有設法保持現有噸位之必要、所惜英海部所發表之公報、語焉不詳、致使美國與論反而爲之惶感不定、在此種情形下、美政府自應明白提出解釋、務使全國上下一致決定以美國艦隊協助英國、例如、華盛頓日報」載稱、「英海部承認大西洋勢亦已好轉、是則問題之重心、厥爲英國商船在別的區域損失重大、其在大西洋上載運美國軍械者則否、果爾、則豈非事實週與美國一般主張利用軍艦護送軍械前往英國者之論調相反乎」、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　昨日倫敦所發表英船損失之數字、此間接到過遲、報紙未及加以批評、僅以大字刊載之、讀者咸發生深切印象、無綫電評論員謂、英方本不撥將此數字即行發表、惟鑒於美國與情之壓迫、乃不得不提前公布之云、參議員樊登堡星期三日所發表英船損失數字、含有大西洋戰爭中英船損失有限之意者、孤立派遂指此爲美國無須在海上續有行動之證、今知樊登堡數字並不完全、此種眞相旣經英方公布、美國會方面、定將有助之、（十一日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>現節段的美日關係</h3>
<p>歐局變化風譎雲詭，美國護航勢在必行，迥憶二月間租借法案在美國會討論時，不得護航且被厘為條文之一，曾幾何時，朝野主張已有絕大角度的轉變。可見美國的參戰問題，適如昨日本報社論所指出，至少已有五成的成熟，其實現只是時間問題。戰爭的擴大本不是可喜的事，但值此侵略罪惡威脅全人類之際，最應當受詛咒的不是戰爭而是侵略者的不戰而統治了全世界，即便向着最壞的前途去推測，至低限度，希臘荷蘭的前途總比丹麥羅馬尼亞更多具有光明之望。</p>
<p>就最近情勢而言，顯然是大西徉彼岸的風雲引起美國更大關切，無論護航抑或參戰，都是直接針對著軸心國家，直到此際為止，美當局迄未透露過到與德義公開決裂之後，對於她們的盟友將採何等步驟。納粹力面固然早在去年九月間在遠東佈置了一着棋，用以牽制美國，這在過去也曾聳人聽聞，但却已日益隨着時日演進而反見冲淡。最近目本確又有人講過履行軸心義務決心對美的話，而且還是出自外務省發言人之口；然而際此種種松岡遊美羅斯福赫爾遊日一類調整美日關係的龐雜論調中，顯然頗有孤獨寂寞之感。這可以不必細辨其間有無眞意與姿態之分，也不必深究其是否出於試探，總可看出此際日本對於太平徉對岸的動靜，正與其對於「中國事變」之不能結束感到同樣焦急。</p>
<p>最近日方輿論，突又强調日本不能以武力征服中國的意見，廣知報等甚且更進而考慮結束「中國事變」的途徑。中國之不能被武力征服早為世人共見的事實，即在日方朝野人士亦復不時表示承認這一認識的眞確，最近日本派駐南京的本多熊太郎在返日之前曾痛斥日方「直接交涉」的主張，你可窺知此際日方對於如何「解決中國事變」正有若干不同意見的爭執存在，廣知報所建議的意見大槪就是本多所反對的對象，於此又可見所謂和平攻勢的萌動在日本業已形成了問題。此其現實效果如何姑不多辯，大槪只是有如華盛頓方面的批評，只是表示日本的片面渴望，但其適在以全力注視美國之際有此萌動，至少可以證明此際日當局心目中的對華與對美，正有如兩條相交的直綫，她現在是企圖針對着兩綫的交叉點一舉予以把握。</p>
<p>東京方面對於美國態度之突呈活躍，不只是蘇日條約的刺激，更是由於國際大局的影響，旬日前合衆社東京消息中關於此點的解釋是值得注意的，牠說日本最近對美的種種姿態大約是根據着其駐美大使野村的報吿與鼓勵，他表示美國所主要關切者在歐洲，是以解決太平洋問題並非無望。同一消息又說：日擬對美談判新的商約以代替已廢止的舊約，有人認為這必須日本對中國作相當讓步始能做到。這大體上都是幻想，但却是日方突又在此際發為和平攻勢的主因之一。日前松岡曾表示將決心採用外交力式以「解決中國事變」，中外商業新聞則斥美方認中國為民治國家之無稽，對照而觀，此中消息實不難索解。質言之，就是日本認為美國往意力大體已被歐戰所牽引，對於太平洋暫無採取行動的意向，這是日本實行和平南進的良機，更是解決中國事變的良機，只要美方可以不干預或者不阻碍日方行動，日方也未必不可以某種保障給予美國。</p>
<p>荷印與日本的石油協定簽訂後，倫敦方面曾發為樂觀見解，表示太平洋之局勢已呈乎意外之改善，並特別提及三國盟約中關於美德開戰後日本並不必須參戰的特別條款。這種樂觀是危險的，固然，此際的目本對於參戰問題頗見審慎，不到絕對有利時不會有所決定，但假如三國同盟眞有那一秘密條款的規定，那却正是日本向着民治國討價還價的張本，也就是其上述幻想所寄託。不過，否人相信，美國對遠東立場之不可動搖，正有如中國自身抗建立傷之不可動搖一樣；日前外間風傳英國對於遠東曾在外交方面別有運用，但艾登否認冉度封鎖緬旬路的有力聲明，正說明了那種讕言之無稽。英國且不肯為了避免自身困艱而放棄對希臘的援助義務，比較英民族更為著重理念的美國當更不會輕蹈背信之愆，這一點可以不必過慮、只是遠東方面迄未能在歐局緊張之前先折斷侵略者的觸鬚，總是一個遺憾。不過美國今日對歐固極重視，對東方也不會放鬆，以其無盡藏的偉力，相信一旦太平徉風波眞也隨着歐局而見動漾，則美國手裏正還握有若干有力有效的武器。</p>

<h3>首批港米昨抵埠　各米號負責零售　成色與市上小絞米相同　洋米產價亦已直綫下瀉</h3>
<p>俟港米應市後將再評定各擋米價</p>
<p>公共租界工部局所採購之首批港米五千噸、（即五萬包）、已由英商怡和公司之明生輪、及太古輪船公司之漢陽輪、分載來滬、最先抵滬者寫明生輪、係下午一時半泊法租界外灘新開河碼頭、漢陽輪則於下午二時半抵埠、泊愛多亞路外灘、兩輪共載來港米約三萬包、當日即開始卸貨上棧、預料今日上午、當可竣事、聞尚有港米二萬包、今日將由太古公司之太原輪運滬、</p>
<p>成色甚佳　即可發售</p>
<p>大中社記者、昨日下午、曾登該兩輪視察、見該輪所　小絞米、其成色確與市上所售之四十粒小絞米、一般無二、昨日因係星期日、各堆棧停止出貨、故訂購是項港米之各行號、預料將於今日起、聞始前往出貨、承辦此項港米之立基洋行、昨日已將各項發售手續辦理完竣、預料即可分發各行號出售、市民如欲購賣是項港米者、可向鄰近各米號購買、每石價格規定為國幣一百十元、時間數量並無限制、</p>
<p>滬港聯合　防止操縱</p>
<p>據航業界消息、此後英商太古怡和兩公司之駛港船隻、將隨時承載當局所採辦之港米來滬、現下港政府除對上海公共租界當局所採購之米糧准許自由出口外、對其他商行採購港米、已實行許可證制、若未領有是項許可證者、則一律禁止出口、蓋此舉係防制有人操縱居奇、又傳、此次公共租界當局、向港政府購辦港米、得以　速見　順利實行者、皆得力於本埠航業界、自願减低水脚甚鉅、</p>
<p>米蠹技窮　市面穩定</p>
<p>據一般人觀察、上週末之米市、尚有大囤戶作最後之掙扎、以港方統制米糧、作為造謠之藉口、致每石米價、被非法抬高三四元、但港米現已抵滬、且即可發售、一般米蠹縱能將米價非法抬高、但市民儘可拒絕向其購買、且香港當局之統制米糧、實　對付米蠹而發、對本市米糧之供給、絕對有益、故時至今日、米蠹所施之一　技倆、均已完全失敗、故今日米價、勢必繼續下跌、而此後之米市、當日趨穩定、殆已無疑矣、</p>
<p>再評米價　即將實行</p>
<p>前曾盛傳、兩租界當局為謀解除平民倒懸、及維護社會治安起見、將於本月十日起、再度評定米糧新限價、予以切實執行、無論國米洋米、一律於是日起每石（一百六十市斤）不得超過一百十元之標準限價、今本市又盛傳、米糧新限價、因廉價港米未克提早抵埠、特將新限價轉期實行、惟本市居民之期待當局重訂米糧新限價、其至殷至切之情緒、已見一斑、務望當局尅日促其實現、</p>
<p>洋米產價　隨滬下瀉</p>
<p>昨向各承辦米糧洋行探悉、西貢·暹邏·仰光等產米區米價、前亦曾逐步上升、因滬市米價高昂、彼地米商亦乘機抬價漁利故也、其時本市米商因洋米產價昂貴、成本不無提高、曾有一部份停止添辦、以致本市米價愈抬愈高、茲因滬市米價猛跌未已、故上述各產米區米價、亦接踵下落、某注行前日曾接仰光　吿、「訂米已啟運、米價繼續直瀉」、又據另一方面稱、嗣後運船隻、可逐漸增多、</p>

<p>舉行午宴</p>
<p>惟以國際時局關係、當局不擬過事舖張、僅假美國　會舉行午宴、以中美兩國關係日趨親善、故屆時美國商會將招待本年赴美留學之中國學生、由美國學校之學生十餘人及其家屬陪座、是晚張盛宴、款待旅滬美僑、本年復以美僑之先後奉令歸國、已不若往歲之盛、</p>

<h3>護士的母親節</h3>
<p>中華基督教協進會為發揚孝親美德，特發起規定昨日為中國首屆父母節，各團體在熱烈舉行各僩孝親集會聲中，中華護士會上海支會也在貝當路美國教堂舉行護士們的「母親節。」紀念護士們的「母親」——英國弗羅倫絲那丁凱女士。Florence　Nightingale</p>
<p>連綿霪雨初霽，嫩綠的樹葉　着異樣光彩，靜穆的貝當路沐浴在煦麗的陽光中。繁茂的壁籐裝綴在美國教堂上，雄壯的讚美詩從敎堂裏傳入散步在草地上人們的耳中，每個人的心胸，感受聖歌的洗禮。下午二時敲過，白衣的護士小姐，陸續來到教堂旁邊的這片大草地上，嬉笑歡樂之聲，揚溢耳邊。敎堂旁邊的樓上，傳出洋人們午餐的樂聲。美好的陽光親灸在每個人的臉上，感覺初夏的溫熱。宇宙與宗教的偉大魔力，使我感得人生之所以可貴。</p>
<p>五百多位「白衣天使」聚集在草地上，攝入了開麥拉中，有秩序地雙雙魚貫進入教堂。包含着上海各大醫院如紅十字會第一醫院，仁濟醫院，紅房子婦擩醫院，伯特利醫院，南洋醫院，中華健康協會公共衛生護士部……等等。各醫院的畢業生排列在敎堂正中的樓座上，學生護士分列兩側樓廂，服務的護士坐於敎堂地面的排座上。雄壯的進行曲奏畢，接着是全體護士合唱的中華護士會歌。主席伍哲英女士致詞說：一年一度的護士們的集會，今天最是熱烈。接着是兪牧師的祈禱和讀經，其次是上海女子醫科大學唱詩班的合唱。下面是中華護士會幹事田粹勵女士的演講，她的話說得很多，以德·智·體三育勗勉護士們，希望護十們英勇忠誠地負起健康的責任，這責仟不單是在醫院，應及於社會的任何地方，尤其是國難時期。</p>
<p>沈葆昌夫人獨唱畢，接着又是兪牧師的演講，他說他生平只有過一次對醫生說話，是遠在許多年前的一次醫學會大會中。他說平常只有醫生教訓我們，而我能有敎訓醫生的機會，這是很榮幸的。今天該是第二次。</p>
<p>『今天是父母節；但今天眞眞是護士們的母親節，所以這意義格外深重。』俞牧師說：『護士們應該永遠不忘你們的「母親——弗羅倫絲那丁凱女士，紀念她的生日，紀念她爲國家民族服役，和創設護士事業的精神。』</p>
<p>『弗羅倫絲那丁凱女士生於一八二〇年五月十二日，卒於一、九一〇年八月十三日。』兪牧師繼續報吿這位護士們的「母親」的歷史。「她的身體原不十分强健，但她能享受九十歲的高壽，這是她畢生辛勞服務的結果。』</p>
<p>『她是生長在富有的家庭裏，但她富有爲人們服務的精神，即使她看見一隻狗因受了傷給牠的主人將要處死的時候，她給解救把這只傷狗醫好了。由這同情心促成她爲病人看護的動機。</p>
<p>「因爲她的家庭是富有的，所以常常有機會往各國各地去旅行。有一次她隨家屬到果處去旅行，忽然她自己生了病，經天主敎敎士們周密看護，她的病給醫好了。她在病中學得看護的方法，這是促成她決心要提倡看護事業的動機。</p>
<p>「一八五四年歐洲發生了戰事，她鑒於前綫受傷將士的痛楚，她毅然決然招集了三十八位經她調練過的護士，赴前方服務，在戰地後方經過三年的長期服役，歷經種種困難辛勞，給她醫好了數千萬的受傷戰士。從此她受到全國人民的熱烈擁戴歡迎，護士的工作從此被人們視爲病人的救星，她們的地位不下於醫生。</p>
<p>『必須要尊重護士的工作，才能提高護士的地位：弗羅倫絲那丁凱女士能成爲全世界護士的「母親」，就是因爲尊重她自己的工作，她以自己辛勞服役的成績，提高護士的地位，有如今日。這是她一身奮鬥的結果。她對於護士有下列四個條件：（一）祖續不斷的虛心學習，（二）嚴守紀律秩序如軍隊士兵，（三）像士兵對於長官的服從精神，（四）豐富的同情心；護士不具備這四條不能稱爲優良的護士。</p>
<p>『當一八五四年的時代，英國有兩位女子最受全國人們的擁戴，一位是伊利莎白女皇，一位就是護士的「母親」弗羅倫絲那丁凱女士。弗羅倫絲那丁凱女士逝世後，卜葬在倫敦惠斯敏士德大敎堂裏，可見她地位的崇高，和全國朝野人士的愛戴了。』</p>
<p>這確是對於護士們的一個最美麗的故事。</p>
<p>在雄壯的聖歌中，我隨着「白衣天使」們走出了美國教堂。下午四時半，正當一個美好的太陽照耀着明凈的馬路，和周圍新綠的樹枝上。（蔣萍）</p>

<h3>中國戰時的特產統銷</h3>
<p>— 禾章</p>
<p>中國的貿易政策，在此番戰事中，倒克服了一切困難，而健全的長成起來，一天天向着合理化途岸邁進。諸如管理範圍，則由局部統制；管理技術，則由簡單而進於嚴密；管理機構，則由重複而進於統一。這許多事實，實令我們興奮異常。</p>
<p>尤其是在這次戰時貿易政策中，國營機關對於特定幾項物品的統銷，以及與友邦易貨制度的確定，已有最偉大的成就。其實統銷與易貨是不能分的，統銷創意即起於易貨。現在政府規定的統銷特產是桐油，茶葉，猪鬃，鑛產四種，除鑛產中資　委員會經營外，基餘三種皆由貿易委員會經營。該會之下設立三個國營公司：復興公司辦理桐油；中國茶葉公司辦理茶葉；富華公司辦理猪鬃和雜貨。最初由政府統銷的是茶葉，茶葉的收歸政府統銷，即由於對蘇易貨，接着美國貸款成立，以桐油為担保而成立易貨協定，由復興公司辦理·因此，其他商品也有列入易貨物品的趨向。</p>
<p>一，特產統銷的設施</p>
<p>自財政頒布「管理全國茶葉出口貿易辦法大網」以後，貿易委員會即擬定「各省茶葉管理機關組織通則」，呈奉行政院核准，通令浙，閩，皖，湘贛，鄂等產茶的六省府，依照上述通則，組織茶葉管理處。此外，並由該會擬定各省茶葉貸款收購計劃，自二十七年起，成立鉅額茶貸，該會出八成，由各該省府二成辦理之。旋經財政部令將茶葉收購及內銷，銷及易貨事宜。民國二十九年復經財部中央信託局增資改組為國營專業公司，歸由貿易委員會管轄，統辦茶葉統購統銷，從此茶葉的推銷組織，益形健全。</p>
<p>桐油統銷自二十七年開始，貿易委員會於二十八年十月六日擬定全國桐油統一購銷辦法草案，呈請財政部轉呈行政院公佈施行。關於委託收購方面，該會於二十七年十二月間曾與中國植物油料廠訂立合約，旋又於二十八年二月訂「調整全國桐油貿易暫行細則」。關於管理四川桐油貿易方面，四川省政府為協助桐油輸出起見，與該會制定「四川桐油貿易暫行辦法大網」，以便利貿易委員會統購統銷的工作。後來財政部為求全國桐油購銷的更統一起見，於二十九年十月二十日公布「全國桐油統購統銷辦法」十五條，以及「全國桐油統購統銷辦法施行細則」十七條。自該辦法公布後，全國各地桐油的收購　銷事宜，則由復興商業公司統一辦理。</p>
<p>猪鬃是重要外銷貨品之一，四川年產白猪鬃三千餘担，約値二百餘萬元，向由上海外商及日人漂製運銷各國。軍興以後，國人有用渝漂鬃廠的設立，但資本不大，規模甚小。貿易委員會於是子二十八年一月間，予以收買，擴充其原有設備，增加其流動資金，自行運銷歐美。黑鬃方面，該會為促進外銷起見，曾與四川畜產貿易公司成立合約，委託代為收購。該公司於收毛貨時，可向該會預支貨價，以資週轉。二十九年三月三日財政部頒布「修正全國猪鬃統銷辦法」，規定全國各色猪鬃的收購運銷事宜，歸貿易委員會統一辦理。貿委會對於猪鬃的收購　理，得委託經營猪鬃業的商號行棧辦理。</p>
<p>中國的鑛產資源，甚為豐富，如，鎢，銻，錫，汞等在世界資源上，佔有極重要的地位。軍興以後，關於鑛產品的收購運銷，由經濟部指定資源委員會執行。經部為嚴密統制各地鑛產品起見，曾於十十八年十二月二日公布「鑛產品運輸管理規則」，根據此規則，復制定「資　委員會管理鑛產品實施辦法」，於二　九年一月間頒行全國，指定專吿管理機關及委託代辦之各省主管官署機關，綜理一切。此項機關，已在江西，湖南，廣東，廣西，雲南，貴州，四川，福建，浙江，湖北等省，先後成立。全部鑛產品，劃分甲乙兩種：甲種鑛產品為鎢，銻，錫，汞，　，銅等；乙種鑛產品為鋁，鎳，鉛，錳，等鑛砂，石灰，硫土，耐火粘土，苦土石，白雲石，酸碱弗石，明礬，石膏，磷礦，砒礦及其製品。甲種鑛產品的收購運輸及其他有關事項，都歸鎢，管理分處，或銻　管理分處管理，或委託其他機關執行，不得自由買賣，其收購價格，由資源委員會隨時核定公布。乙種鑛產品得自由買賣，但運輸出口，須呈資委會或其委託機關審核，塡發出口許可證，並向銀行結滙後方得報關。關於採煉甲種鑛產品之商人，應將該項鑛產品之實存量及可能與實際產量，報請登記，以便支配產量及銷量。這種辦法，較過去的更統一更嚴密</p>
<p>二、統銷出口的槪况</p>
<p>上述四種物品的出口，經政府當局的統購統銷之後，在極困難的環境中，仍能保持良好的現象，且有增加的趨勢。茲將這四種物品的出口槪况作一簡單的叙述：</p>
<p>華茶的銷路，向銷歐，非，美洲各國。軍興以後，中國因對蘇易貨關係，曾集中於對蘇貿易；可是因了運輸的不方便，也未能盡量地發展。按諸關册，二十六年各種茶葉出口總値為二千九百萬元。二十七年上半年出口較少，下半年則較多，總値為三千三百餘萬元。二十八年上半年出口又减，下半年較多，全年部値比上一年减少，為三千〇數十萬元。到了二十九年，出口價値與數量都有增加，在價値方面，竟達一萬萬〇四百餘萬元；在數量方面，較上一年增加十餘萬公擔。關於各種華茶的出口，大多由香港輸出。華茶的市塲，原來以英，美，南非，蘇聯為主，自從歐戰爆發之後，銷售的市塲大起變化。英國用進口限額制度，統制外茶輸入，華茶的銷塲影響至大。北非市塲，近祇摩洛哥尚有大宗銷路。美國近亦有增加。至於對蘇聯市塲，在關册中，最近無數字可查；但據本年一月間重慶已於去年底完成，其內容計分為三部，第一二兩部係以中國之羊毛及價値一萬萬元之茶業交換蘇聯之接濟品，早經簽字宣布。從這龐大的數値看來，可見中國的茶葉，大部是銷至蘇聯的。</p>
<p>桐油的銷路，以美國銷納最大，他如英，法，德，義，日以及其他各國，也均有相當輸入。自戰事發生之後，桐油出口所受的影響，可說甚鉅。如桐油出口，二十四年有七十三萬餘公擔，價値四千一百餘萬元；二十五年達八十六萬餘公擔，價値七千三百餘萬元。二十六年上半年，桐油出口殊為可觀，六月達一千餘萬元，七月達一千五百餘萬元，八月以後，則受到戰事影響，下降至月僅五六百萬元；可是全年的總數量與總値，仍甚巨大，數量達一百餘公擔，價値達八千九百八十四萬五千一百餘元。到了二十七年，是年九月以前，雖尚有粵漢鐵路可通，但桐油素用散艙裝船，今改由鐵路運輸，很不方便。所以二十七年全年桐油出口，數量下降至六十九萬五千七百餘公擔，價値僅三千九百多萬元。二十八年，桐油完全改由昆明與龍州出口，運輸困難，運費益高，因此國外市塲價格大增。故是年出口數量雖大减；但價値方面與上一年相仿。二十八年的三千三百餘萬元，增出二千多萬元；可是在數量上，因了運輸的理困難，却已减少。二十九年十月間財政部頒布「全國桐油統購統銷辦法」以後，桐油的外銷，當可增進。據本年三月二十二日報載電訊，對外貿易專家觀察，本年度國產桐油，必將暢銷，其主要對象，自屬美國，因為：　美國大量製造軍需品，桐油為主要原料之一；　美國桿桐受氣候土壤人力限制，已達飽和點。所以，今後桐油出口當可增加。</p>
<p>豬鬃本是中國向　盛譽的出口貨，近由於政府的提倡和統制，出口更增。二十六年一月至四月都是一百萬元左右，五月為二百餘萬元，六月為三百餘萬元，七月為四百餘萬元，八月雖降至一百餘萬元；但九月以後又是三百餘萬元。可見此項出口，並未受戰爭較大的影響。二十七年的情形，也還可觀，全年總値為二千八百萬元。二十八年以後，因政府當局銳意整頓，竭力增加出口，全年總値增加至四千一百餘萬元。二十九年的情形，更為增進，全年總値竟達九千四百餘萬元，居是年出口第一位</p>
<p>軍興以來，由於政府當局的努力促進，各種重要商品的出口量，無不大增。其間鑛產一項，尤為政府當局促進外銷的對象。這對象一面在保持國際市塲的地位，一面在維持國民經濟及金融的活潑。所以鑛產的出口，在戰時，尤値得重視。鑛產出口，近年總在一萬萬元以上，其中最重要的有錫，鎢，銻等。這在戰　早成為出口的大宗，戰時出口數量，每年仍是不少。二十五年，錫錠塊等値二千六百餘萬元。戰事發生之後，二十六年出口將近四千萬元。最近三年，也都在三千五六百萬元上下，大部由滇，桂兩省出口。鎢鑛在戰前出口數量甚少，二十四，五年，都只値八九百萬元上下，一直到二十六年，出口鎢砂値四千萬元，二十七年値五千萬元，二十八年値四千五百萬元，可是二十九年却减少了，僅値　千百萬元，這或是由於借款抵償關係，出口數字不能完全錄入關係，出口數字不能完全錄入關册。至於銻砂的出口，在上次歐戰中，是一種極重要的輸出貨品；在今次大戰中，當更有其重要性。但最近幾年出口的數量，都僅値五六百萬元，這　關册中所示的區區數字，　非全部。這種軍用原料的輸出，歸政府統銷後，實際的出口數値必甚可觀。</p>
<p>三、結論</p>
<p>上面四種特產的出口在困難的環境中，仍有如許成績，足見政府統制的成效。本年第一季這四種特產的輸出，大體上又有進步的現象。茲錄本年第一季輸出價値於下：　桐油八一，九九五公擔，二三，八六四，五七七元；上年同季五〇，二一〇公擔，七，五三八，七二四元。　茶葉二三，一三五公擔，六，三七二，五五五元；上年同季一六四，二七〇公擔，四三，五六九，三九二元。　豬鬃七五五，九三一公斤，二六，九〇九，一四七元；一年同　七三一，四七〇公斤，八，七七〇，二〇二元。　鑛產包括鑛砂金屬及金屬製品値一〇二，四〇八，四三七元；　年同季一六，五二二，七二七元。上面說過，政府統銷的貨品，有易貨或償債等關係，　册數字並非全貌；然而從本年第　季政府統銷物品的出口數字看來，也可槪見增　的一斑。</p>
<p>總之，這幾種特產在政府獎勵生產與統購統銷之下，今後出口，自然尚可增加。如　國人能與政府通力合作，更能收統制的宏效。這裏要說明的，戰時的輸出貿易實含有一種新的意義，這種貿易的外匯的重是來源，有了外滙更可鞏固金融，並從國外輸入生產工具。換言之，戰時的輸出貿易，是國防力量的一個重要來源。所以，國人如與政府的切實合作，實是義不容辭的。</p>

<h3>平準基金運用問題</h3>
<p>— YQ</p>
<p>中美貨幣談判，去秋已經開始，且當即決定中美貨幣聯盟的原則；但協定一直沒有簽字，大槪因為技術上尚有問題之故。</p>
<p>現在，協定已於上月底簽字，美國已提供五千萬美元，作為法幣匯兌平準基金之一：同時英國亦把基金額增擴到一千萬鎊，再與我國國家銀行提供之數合計，法幣的匯兌基金，至少已在一億一千萬美元之上。中英美一國當局現正遴選人員，合組匯兌平準基金管委會。不消說：前為懸案的打樁問題，現在當已完全解決了。</p>
<p>然而怎樣解決的呢？那就是怎樣去平準中英美三國間的匯兌市塲呢？決非局外人得而知之，然也最為局外人所想得而知的問題。</p>
<p>這幾大，本市外匯黑市塲上，中外銀行，特別是日商銀行，一致向匯豐銀行拋塞外匯，我想：除了逃避未來的損失之外，不無有意試探匯豐銀行對於今後滙兌平準方針的態度，亦未可知。</p>
<p>三國當局對於今後的平準方針，究已作何決定？吾人自也不得而知。但得以斷言的：法幣基礎從此更加强，法幣在國際匯市上的地位，從此必將提高；美財長毛根韜前天向國會報吿中美貨幣聯盟一事時，對此表示充分的樂觀；倫敦權威界人士，對法幣前途，也頻發觀論調。而且本市的黑滙率，已節節放長；金價正慘厲的狂跌等等；也是以反映一般投機者等好心理的普遍。正因為如此，所以現在拋塞外匯是逃避損失，收進變成接受損失。然為避免落入人手，匯豐却不得不酌予收進。於是滙豐銀行；的掛牌，不得不稍分步驟：匯豐小櫃台上的活動，也不得不變成非鬆若干不納的局面；而行外回軟，正是匯豐拉回法幣與轉嫁損失的機會，像上週末一度回軟，旋即回鬆的經過一樣。</p>
<p>所謂平準基金的運用問題除了穩定在何種水準外，在上海，尚有一個特殊的課題：那就是如何防止落入人手？過去一般人慣以「維持」「不維持」與此問題拉在一起；現在已不復成立。當中美中央貨幣協定簽字後，四行即斷然復業，足見「維持」實為旣定不變的固定政策。而對於此項威脅的解除，似一把遲到更緊要的機扭。這就是美國的擴大禁運，與美國的凍結存美之軸心國存款的兩個計畫。以日美關係極度緊張的現在，日方對於美匯的磚雕要已降到最小程度，今後更要每况愈下。一旦實施凍結，那更不成問題。唯其如此，所以今後中英中美滙兌的平準方針，已很明顯。一言以蔽之：平準基金的運用，今後將與自由中國的物價政策，並　批準？不復如過去之單純的囿於國際收支的調整。目標雖不是上海，上海則將第一個取得其良好的影響。</p>
<h3>看到聽到想到</h3>
<p>美財長毛根韜向國會報吿設立中英美滙平準基金同時，又正式要求國會授權總統减低美元黃金成份。此二事併為一談，過去從未有過。</p>
<p>中交兩行掛牌的商業滙率，是英滙四便士半，美滙七元五角，港滙二元三角三，過去從未在上海黑市上起過作用，今後恐裝飾變成纖滅投機份子的屠刀。</p>
<p>兩租界當局運米輸滬的偉舉，已把米蛙蟲的頭壓扁。活命無數。尚望進一步收拾市塲內部，肅淸殘閥，免貽後患。</p>
<p>據估計，投機棍徒犧牲於今次市塲好轉中，米市約三千萬元，金市約一億元，紗市約一億元，與外股證券等共計約在三億元以上。然而尚未計到盡頭啦！</p>

<p>白人的認識橡膠，應追溯到十六世紀的前半世，那是西班牙人剛已征服墨西哥的時候，有些敎士見土著們用一種石叫Castilloa的橡樹的津液，造成皮毬或衣甲，不過這種玩意並沒有惹起什麽反響。兩個世紀以後，就是一七三六年，在赤道La　Conasnrine　，又在疴勒諾哥河上游，看見印第安人使用「有伸縮性的梨形器皿」。他就寫成報吿，附帶着樣品，送交法國國立科學院，可是這種論文在十五年以後，纔由科學院印布出來，至一七六八年，又在當地研究橡膠的性質，由工程師Fresneau，送交科學院的報吿，但科學院連印也沒有印，不過，印第安人能用以擦去鉛筆筆痕的妙用，也漸漸為人所知，白人也膽怯的用橡膠作些不要緊的小器具了。總說一句，那時橡膠最大的用處，還只是把印第安人造成的膠球割裂以作擦去鉛筆痕跡的「小橡皮」而已。（未完）</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>精神上的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 余羽</p>
<p>本刊歷來對於衣食住行四事之論述，真是精彩非凡，使讀者得到了很多的益處，可是只說及一些物質上的衣食住行問題，對於精神上似乎很少研究。所以我今天想破例來說一些，使我們在精神上得有美好之衣食住行。</p>
<p>閒話不多說了，我現在也分四點來談：</p>
<p>衣——我們每天起身，必換清潔乾淨的衣服來穿，使別人和自己不致感到汗臭，且務使自己的衣服，給人們產生一種美感。但我們在精神上，卻也必須有一件精緻優美的衣服來穿在我們的身上，以使別人羨慕敬畏。但那是一件什麼樣子的衣服呢？我可以乾脆的說一句，就是“道德之衣”。道德高尚，品德良好的人，也就是穿著清潔的“道德之衣”，他們實在是比形式上穿著花花綠綠衣服的人爲漂亮的。</p>
<p>食——我們每天吃東西，才使我們生長起來，生活下去。但我們在精神上也必須有一種精神食糧，使自己的智識增廣，經騐豐富。所謂“精神食糧”就是指好的書本和現實的生活經騐，它們能使我們的學問淵博，強健我們精神上的身體。所以在形式上吃得肥肥胖胖的人，假使他沒有受過教育，那末他的身軀依然是瘦弱而且不健康的。</p>
<p>住——一個人假使住在很壯麗而舒適的屋子裏，在物質方面說，他確實是很寫意的了。但假使這個人是很孤獨的，那末我想他在精神上一定仍很痛苦。所以我以爲在精神上的“住”，則應　“住”在羣眾裏，那意思就是說，。我們做人應該處處爲群眾而著想，不自私自利，而把自己作為廣大的人羣中之一個，爲羣眾之舒適而舒適，爲群眾之痛苦而痛苦。所以，一個人在物質上雖然住在狹小而陰暗的亭子間裏，假使他能把他的精神寄託在群眾裏面，那末他這個人好比住在一座壯偉美麗的房子裏一樣。</p>
<p>行——我們行路，終是選擇清潔而寬廣的街道走，而不喜陰濕齷齪的狹巷。我以為我們在人生的旅程上，也應該選擇康莊大道走才是，不應該走入歧路，　使自己有跌入陷阱的危險。所以走著光明之路的人，他們的前程也是光明的。</p>
<h3>帽和鞋襪</h3>
<p>— 闌</p>
<p>帽子應以輕軟而沒有強壓力的爲佳，因為頭部的皮膚和他部皮膚相同，也要發散水蒸氣和炭酸氣，所以帽子裏有沒有或缺少通氣性，頭部蒸　的水蒸氣等便會充滿在帽子裏而增加帽中的碳酸量，因之就會發生頭痛。據專家考騐，帽子中的空氣只要所含碳酸量較外界多0.3%以上，便要感到頭痛。所以，務必要用通氣性良的材料制成帽子，如用沒有通氣性的材料制成如氈帽呢帽等，必須預備充分的換氣孔，便帽內的空氣易於流通。</p>
<p>頭發是頭部的天然保護物，所以本來沒有戴帽的必要，但許多人喜歡戴帽，幾乎把它作爲裝飾品了，但戴帽就不可忽略了上述條件。在冬天出外，只要戴能夠保持頭部溫度的帽子便得，否則頭部便會發生充血的危險。夏天出外若爲了遮避日光，可戴具有充分換氣孔的草帽，若攜帶著陽傘，那就不必戴帽了。</p>
<p>鞋子是種類很多，但以皮鞋爲最普通，皮鞋雖可防濡濕，但皮鞋內的空氣稀少，比重大而傳濕力強。因此，在冬天是不宜穿皮鞋的。而且，皮鞋沒有通氣性。從皮膚中發散出來的水蒸氣和碳酸氣都積滯在裏面，尤其在步行時，這些排洩物的發散更加旺盛，結果就出足汗而使足潤濕，釀成俗語所謂“濕氣”病，所以，皮鞋是不甚衛生的。羅紗或布類製成的鞋缺點較少，但就不漏水及經久耐穿而言，皮鞋是能壓倒一切的。總之以選擇能防水的而兼備通氣性材料制鞋最為優良。</p>
<p>鞋子第一有須注意是否適合腳寸。鞋子過小易招　皮膚的損傷或骨的變形，更有發生爪疾患的危險。又高跟鞋能使足指底部彎曲而發生足骨的變形，也極易操作腰部，故以不穿為佳。</p>
<p>襪子也是值得注意的。在夏天以薄的為宜，冬天若穿了保溫力大的鞋子，如皮鞋等，以穿厚而比　輕，含有多量空氣的襪子爲優，因為它有防止奪溫　少汗的分泌流通空氣之效。所以，冬天宜於穿毛襪。襪子因較之其他部分容易污穢，而且多吸水分，排洩物發散得多，發出一種不可名狀的惡臭，所以必須時常換洗無，以一天換一天最為適宜。而且，與其大污強洗，實不如小污輕洗實惠，洗的次數雖多，而破壞的機會卻減少了。</p>
<h3>洋山芋的故事</h3>
<p>— 弦外音</p>
<p>大約在二百年前，洋山芋在歐洲還是一個生疎的名字。有一次　個有錢的商人忽然得到他朋友送他的奇怪禮物——是一小袋洋山芋，所以他叫園丁把它種在最優良的土中，而且已經預備嘗嘗它的美味了。到秋天的時候，商人特地請他的朋友們來吃飯，於是他關照廚子，把洋山芋好好的做　碗菜。但是廚子從來沒有烹調過這種異樣的東西，因此他　把細嫩的莖，葉以　小而綠的果實用糖和香料調味，然後送到宴席上。賓客們嘗了之後都覺得沒有滋味。於是這新奇的食物又被帶回廚房而由僕人們吃光。幾個鍾頭之後，這班人都病倒了。醫生說：“這蔬菜含有相當的毒素，但是並不要緊，幾天之後就會好的”。而洋山芋就因此被擲在園子的角落裡。隔了幾天園丁命他的兒子把這已經乾了的洋山芋燒掉。小孩子很高興的去做了，當他在乾的莖和葉燒光之後，就在灰堆裡找到了洋山芋根上一塊塊的東西。剝去　層薄薄的皮就可以看到白而粉質的果肉。氣味好像很好聞？嘗了嘗滋味竟是十分好呢！於是他去告訴他的父親，而他的父親亦覺得十分可口中。至此園丁和廚子才知道他們的錯誤。結果由主人重新向他的朋友那裡要了些洋山芋。從這時候起洋山芋便成為歐洲家庭中的日常蔬菜了。</p>
<h3>扶梯</h3>
<p>— 範學暉</p>
<p>我幼年的時候，走慣了家裏的又闊又大的扶梯，偶然走到鄰居人家，看見他們的高平房，上面搭了一個擱，人要到上面去睡的時候，要從一部竹梯裏爬了上去，我想這是很危險。</p>
<p>後來，我第一次由故鄉到城市，看見城市中的扶梯，小　像我們故鄉竹梯一樣，他們似乎要將扶梯的地位省了。</p>
<p>當我由城市來到都市，更使我，原來都市中的扶梯要比城市中，更窄狹峻峭，而且很多的，黑暗異常，塵埃堆積。</p>
<p>因此我常想到，中國人不肯想到小處；雖然一輛小小的扶梯，它不但是便於行走；塵埃堆積，黑暗不堪，有礙衛生，一旦發生火警，有關全宅生命安全的問題。</p>
<p>我常觀歐美先進諸國，對於住在屋的扶梯，莫不十分重視，他們非但建築堅固，而且均處以相當的地位，或靠邊窗的地方，使它明亮，保障安全。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>這幾天來，不知怎的，連菜蔬也貴起來了，二三角　的一斤菜，真是稀鬆平常的事，至於新上市的時鮮菜，更不用說了。莧菜已上市了十多天，我還不曾配入菜單，就爲的價格太貴之故。莧菜之妙，妙在軟糯，你要做什麼一種魚羹，就少不了它，尤其是黃魚羹，一加了莧菜，就分外的可口。此外或與肉絲肉片一同做湯，味兒也不惡。至於做素的那麼只有清炒而已。紅的莧菜還不見上市，菜性也軟糯，不過湯汁紅紅的，有的人竟不敢吃，可發一笑。</p>
<p>星期一　竹筍炒肉絲　韮芽拌蛋皮　青菜炒線粉　筍丁炒蠶豆</p>
<p>星期二　芹菜牛肉絲　清蒸刀　魚　　菜燒豆腐　竹筍拌　茸</p>
<p>星期三　榨菜肉絲湯　生煎咸　魚　生炒金花菜　扁尖豆腐花</p>
<p>星期四　咖哩牛肉片　明蝦燒豆腐　紅燒蘿葡片　蝦米紫菜湯</p>

<h3>由昆明到臘戌</h3>
<p>— 觀射</p>
<p>一個朋友的來信：</p>
<p>在在此段行程，一路無食物可得，同人因事前未知，所帶乾糧太少，在此一日兩夜，只得竭力縮食節飲，倖免飢渴，縱有萬千金錢，亦無從購買，黃金到此全無用，此味亦不容不一領略之。二十一日下午二時又至一橋畔，前車司機突以手指天，大家都明白是怎麼一回事了，乃停車坐山石上靜看，未幾，土石飛揚，各人此時只念橋之安危，自身生命，反置度外；誠以　處臨空鐵索飛橋，碩果僅存，能無惴惴；數分鍾後，音響已息，乃偕司機下山繞道至橋邊。睹橋兀然無恙，不禁歡呼，否則至少須有一星期之耽擱，又至被烽處察看，拾得彈片兩塊，留為紀念，孰料後竟被人竊去，此賊而竊此物，可謂有心人。</p>
<p>公路是破壞了！但是不到天黑，已經修好。車輛魚貫行駛，十一時至臘猛（七八一·七公里），無食無宿，又睡車內一夜。二十二日宿芝市（八七三公里），屬土司管轄，居民十之七八是漢擺夷人，國人僅十之二三，此地每至雨季，瘴疫最盛。除真正貧苦者，均避至他處，無敢居留。中國銀行在此設有分處。是日適逢趕集之期——五天一集！故市場相當熱鬧。我得朋友之引導，遍遊各處。始知此處在亂山堆中，溝渠縱橫。雨後蚊蚋叢生，傳染惡性虐疾。居民又不講衛生，豬牛遍地，遺矢狼藉。在此初春時期，已覺濁臭難聞；天氣稍暖，經陽光蒸晒，其氣味自更不堪生活想像，實爲疫　之原。倘能改進此種狀況，不難化瘴鄉爲樂土也。市上華夷雜沓，山頭夷腰間繞鐵索　　道，或環繫竹片，口如血盆，上身半裸，聞甚野蠻。另有一種生擺夷。不常下山，以殺異族爲勇敢。二十三日宿畹町——九五九·四公裡——此地乃新近開闢，故市面更不如芝市。中緬交界處，有五尺見方之白十字分界，共有五六處。畹町亦屬土司管轄；國人甚少，僅旅客經過，過此即離國境而入緬界。二十四日下午五時許安抵臘戌，十一天旅程，至此乃告結束。</p>
<p>卡車行山上，顛簸甚劇，令人啼笑皆非。沿途時有覆車之事，萬丈深淵，縱不粉身碎骨，生命百無一存。此次旅行，亦屢屢遇險。一次山石崩墜，車適在轉灣處，煞車已來不及；幸司機靈敏，開足速力沖過。車過不及一分鍾，即聞轟然巨響，有石破天驚之勢。又一次亦在轉灣處，幾與來車互撞；司機習性頑強，魚按喇叭招呼來車，但均極勇敢。</p>
<p>臘戌地面頗小，完全是新開闢處女地。各街　大興土木，“伐木丁丁”之塊，不絕於耳。房屋均用木板做成，鐵皮作頂。間或有絕少數用水泥建築，而屋頂仍是鐵皮。柚木在臘戌，等於松板合吾國內地。居民緬人最多，印人次之。國人在臘，除華僑外，大半經營運輸事業。電燈甚少，因煤源關係，多數均用汽油燈。生活費用甚高；既無名勝與風景，亦無高等影院，只有印度人開疫影院一家，映印人自攝影片，間有英國制舊片而已。幸重慶報紙寄到甚速，隔三四日即可看見，此外尚有仰光報紙可看。氣候中午甚暖，早晚相差甚巨，國人到此者多患虐疾，上　航信，須二十日左右方能到達。（完）</p>

<h3>都市風景綫</h3>
<p>— 李鴻禮</p>
<p>都市的一角</p>
<p>爲着翁大那段路「包飯作」的緣故，小七子正和小馬子，阿五，咕咕地商量着。快座點時，遠遠地顯出挑飯的担子，餓了天半的翁大搶先跑上去，小七子們早防好了他，三脚兩步的追上了他，阿五緊抱着了翁大，他們倆很快的倒完了剩下的飯，菜，都一溜烟地跑了！</p>
<p>「追也是瞎子打燈籠！」他把地上還有遺下的米粒拾起來吃了就預備走。</p>
<p>「出老！想跑了，挑了走！」挑担的咆哮了。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？我又沒吃着」。</p>
<p>「你媽的，你們一夥，想打過門？吃白食不出力，挑不挑」？</p>
<p>翁大頭上覺得痛了兩下，挑起担子就走。</p>
<p>愈挑愈重，愈走愈慢的翁大，幾次求老司務讓他歇歇，可是終不得允許；到全身覺着輕時，雙脚祇能拖着走了！</p>
<p>他忽然發現了什麽似的，不知哪兒來的一股勇氣，向前搶了個行路人的麵包拚命的跑，跑……</p>
<p>後面的呼聲聽不見了半犬，他才停了腿，胸口一熱「喀」地一聲，鮮紅的血，吐在地上，他挨着牆角坐下，恨不得一口把麵包整呑下去。</p>
<p>癩脚阿四不知什麽時候穿了出來，翁大嚇得發抖，祇是想把那吃剩一牟的麵包藏起來。</p>
<p>「翁大！大家分分！」</p>
<p>「那有這樣容易，這是性命換來的！」</p>
<p>「給不給？」他帶着點怒意。</p>
<p>「不給」他也哼起來了！</p>
<p>也是癩脚阿四先動手，兩人厮打了一會。</p>
<p>等翁大醒來麵包早不知那兒去了！地上有點血，膿，是癩脚阿四留下的吧！</p>
<p>慢慢地站了起來，想去打癩脚阿四，小七子們去算個賬。</p>
<p>轉了個灣。一羣「同行」都站在路旁，由他們嘴裏得知回頭有輛米車要來呢！</p>
<p>幾個人都在商量着：誰願吊上車去割開米袋大家多分點給他，翁大却一口答應了！</p>
<p>路燈已亮了！車子果然來了，他吊上車去，拿出刀來就割那麻袋，上面的鞭子無情地抽在他頭上，手上，身上，他不放手，還在割着，米簌簌的出來，他們都接着了！</p>
<p>終於脫了手，掉了下來，可是那些「同行」却不知哪兒去了！</p>
<p>天全黑了！翁大滿是傷痕的身子，步入了小弄堂，一陣呻吟聲，震動了他的耳鼓膜，在慘澹的燈下他辨也了躺在地上的人。</p>
<p>「麻皮！……」</p>
<p>「水……」</p>
<p>麻皮大粒的汗珠從額上掉下來。</p>
<p>「水…水……」</p>
<p>翁大在近家要了碗水走到這兒：</p>
<p>「水來了！……」</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>麻皮的頭被他的手抬了起來，兩眼直瞪瞪地望着他。</p>
<p>「呃！……一股臭氣直　入他的鼻孔裏，麻皮脚上水泡已經破了！在流着白水。</p>
<p>「完了！……」</p>
<p>他想了一會兒，兩手在麻皮的衣服裏亂摸了半天，可是祇得了一小包「白粉」不過還能賣兩角錢呢！</p>
<p>他又想了一會兒。</p>
<p>等他離開這兒，麻皮的屍身已經是裸體的了！</p>
<h3>證婚　—喜事廳速寫</h3>
<p>— 鞠</p>
<p>「嚴先生，某先生到了！」門口分發車飯錢的小汪蹤連帶跳地進來，嚴總務正全神貫注的在佈排禮堂，小注的話在他耳邊沿被擋駕了。小在性急火起，一手把他拖了就走，嚴總務正待詢問，擎迎賓」牌高呼「客來」的，和他撞了一個滿懷。他眞機警，那後面跟着的不就是他邀請來證婚的某先生嗎？</p>
<p>「哈哈，某先生，勞駕，一勞駕。」</p>
<p>「哈哈，哈……哈」，某先生也似乎喜氣洋溢的附和着，眼睛向四週一掃。恭了喜，行過禮。敬茶，某先生在椅上坐了下來，眼睛再向四週一掃。</p>
<p>「某先生，有勞大駕，眞是不勝光榮，哈哈……」主人詔媚地彎腰曲背地說。</p>
<p>「哈哈，那沒關係，承蒙看得起……。嚴先生又是老朋友，哈哈。」</p>
<p>「某先生眞是言而有信」，嚴總務像得了褒獎般地，「那個，太早一點吧？我們中飯剛用過。」</p>
<p>「唔，也許差不多，二點半已過了。」某先生立了起來，在座的也一骨碌地立起來，「好在早點舉行更好，來得寬舒些……。」</p>
<p>「是是，堂會也可延長些了。」內中一個說。</p>
<p>「不錯，某先生高見極是。」又一個。</p>
<p>於是總管，主人，招待等，七手八脚地整理，堂中羅得很緊張，漸漸也有些莊嚴氣派，某先生也屢屢幫助，什麽證書，印泥，秩序表等分派好沒有？</p>
<p>某先生用絹巾撫額角，悠然的踱到臺前，典禮就在他的催促中進行了，比原來預定提早了一小時。</p>
<p>「哈哈，結婚結婚，是要『急急』的，哈哈哈哈，」某先生張着嘴笑說，好像替自己在辯護。</p>
<p>「哈哈，」……。進行曲很快地節奏了，新人忐忑着，賓客歡悅着，某先生小安目更焦急着。</p>
<p>「嚴先生，我去了。」某先生才把寳章放進袋去，不待說，「退」後下來，整整領管，向總管招呼。</p>
<p>「某先生，此地吃杯酒去！」主人發覺證婚人倏地下退後，親自趕過來。</p>
<p>「嗄，不客氣，別處還有應酬。」某先生回身欠了欠身。</p>
<p>「老兄眞是貴人多忙，那末我們不客氣了，今天還有別家？」總管邊談邊送他出門。</p>
<p>「唔，還有三家，……哈哈，實在分不轉身。」</p>
<p>「勞駕，勞駕，某先生。」主人在他跨上車廂時，行了個九十度深禮。</p>
<p>某先生是社會上的名流，又是這裏的證婚人，大家便在酒席上談到他。</p>
<p>「某先生的到來，眞是蓬門生輝。不是嗎，他是婦孺皆知的聞人，很不易請到呢！」</p>
<p>「他許是有請必到的？假使沒那個，他眞肯勞駕來剪彩揭幕，證婚等嗎？這裏嚴總管已準備好好地謝謝他呢！哈哈……。」</p>
<h3>媽媽掃米來</h3>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>當秋海棠第二度又回復知覺的時候，身體上最先感受到的反應，就是臉部的疼痛，簡直痛得比雞啄蟲鑽還難受，眞像有幾十百口絲花針刺在他肌肉裏一樣，尤其是左邊的一個眼睛，痛中帶癢，癢中帶痛，使他情不自禁的舉起一條右手來想撫摸一下。</p>
<p>可是他的手才舉到一半，便覺得有人把他按住了，接着又聽得一個女人的聲音，在他耳旁輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「別動！過一會就可以不痛了。」他這才把僅餘的一隻右眼睜開了，在强烈的電燈光下，他發覺自己所見到的幾乎是一片白色：白的天花板。白的窗簾，白的桌椅，白的牀毯，甚至連房內在走動的人所穿的衣服也都是白的。</p>
<p>「這是什麽地方啊？」腦神經在受了過度的刺激以後，元自覺得有些昏昏然。</p>
<p>「玉琴，你可以原諒我嗎？」一個很熟的聲音，在他牀前着響：他把右眼向四下裏脧看了好半響，才發現那幾個穿白野報的人的中間，有一個竟是袁紹文。</p>
<p>紹文的臉上雖還勉强透着一絲微笑，然而神氣是多麽慘淡啊？他不但不能安慰秋海棠，反倒提醒了他幾小時前所演出的一幕。</p>
<p>他知道自己從此就完了！這麽一張醜惡的臉龐，別說不能唱戲，簡直連站到人前去也不能了！他眞恨不得立刻把臉上包紮着的　多紗布一起揪下來。</p>
<p>「你請靜養幾天吧！」紹文握住了他的一手說：「所有的事都在我身上。」</p>
<p>「生命是絕對不妨的。」一個戴着眼鏡，神氣像是醫生一樣的人說。</p>
<p>秋海棠的一隻睜大着的右眼裏，慢慢地滾出了幾滴淚珠來。</p>
<p>「性命？性命當然是不妨的！」他雖然祇用着極低的聲音說，但憤怒的情緒，顯然很強烈地在他心頭燃燒着。「這就叫做死不饒人！」（一〇三）</p>

<h3>Pan-American Representatives to Meet the Day After Tomorrow; Roosevelt to Deliver Speech</h3>
<p>Elaborating on Foreign Policy and the "Protect America Committee" Urges Effective Aid to China</p>
<p>Washington - It is expected that President Roosevelt will deliver a major speech on U.S. foreign policy when he addresses the Latin American mission to the United States on Wednesday. According to well-informed congressional sources, the President's speech will clarify current issues and explain the extent to which the United States will go to ensure the safe delivery of aid to Britain. For this reason, government leaders have decided to postpone expressing their views on the convoy issue in the Senate. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Times reports that President Roosevelt's position on the convoy issue will be clear when he addresses the Pan American Union on the 14th of this month. With Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox having already publicly declared their support for convoys, President Roosevelt cannot avoid expressing his own opinion on this matter. (Havas, date unspecified)</p>
<p>Washington - White House Secretary O'Leary stated yesterday that President Roosevelt's temperature is normal, but he must continue to rest under strict medical guidance and cannot meet with the Latin American naval representatives currently in the United States, which he deeply regrets. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - The issue of naval convoys for shipping supplies to Britain, and whether U.S. naval convoys are equivalent to entering the war, is being widely debated in local and national newspapers. Isolationists, pro-government factions, and those primarily supporting all-out aid to Britain have been holding meetings to discuss the matter. It is expected that a concrete decision on this matter will be made within a few weeks. Editorials in most newspapers support the recent speeches by the four key government officials on aid to Britain and believe that the purpose of these speeches is to arouse public opinion to facilitate the government's adoption of proactive measures regarding the European situation. President Roosevelt's illness and lack of communication with reporters for the past two weeks have further fueled speculation, and there is much conjecture about what he will say to the press next week. President Roosevelt's upcoming speech to the Latin American Association is also subject to much speculation. Some reporters believe that even if the situation worsens, the United States will not formally enter the war, and Germany does not want to formally declare war on the United States because the United States could then adopt a full wartime system, accelerate production, and take even more aggressive measures. This was the reason why the United States was able to defeat Germany in the past. Currently, newspapers here, regardless of party affiliation, unanimously advocate adopting a convoy system, regardless of the consequences, but several major newspapers still support the isolationist position. They uniformly highlight the anti-convoy remarks of Lindbergh, Wheeler, and Nye. A reporter from a Midwestern newspaper told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the opinions of isolationists opposing intervention in the European war zone are gradually moving toward supporting Roosevelt's diplomatic policy. As for whether they support naval convoys alone or all-out support for democratic countries, he said that once the President announces his decision to the nation, the general public will support it. The National Committee to Defend America released a declaration on the 7th, advocating that the United States immediately declare a state of emergency and use its naval and air forces to defend the lifeline of transportation between the Western Hemisphere and the United States. The committee also advocated providing effective aid to China, implementing a blockade against Japan, and declaring the United States' determination to defend Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, freezing Axis assets in the United States, and forming a global permanent peace with all its might. Yesterday, the committee passed a resolution advocating that the United States also use its naval and air forces to protect supplies bound for countries resisting aggression in the most effective way possible, ensuring that these supplies reach their destinations. In addition, the "Fight for Freedom Committee" also issued a declaration taking a more aggressive stance, stating that, "We have already joined the war, therefore, the United States should immediately declare a state of emergency and immediately use naval power to transport food and weapons to the fighters of the democratic bloc, while severing diplomatic relations with all aggressor countries." (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - The Seafarers International Union yesterday approved a condition for a cargo ship to cross the Pacific Ocean: that war bonuses be retroactively paid if ship fares allow for it in the future. The union's demand for voyages to dangerous areas is a bonus of US$2 per day for seafarers, and a bonus of US$50 per person for each port call at the mouth of the Yangtze River or the Gulf of Aden. This demand will delay the departure of the Luchenbach, Sea Witch, and McKeesport, the former two bound for the Far East and the latter for Australia. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to the statement made yesterday by Maritime Commission Chairman Land to the Senate Commerce Committee, American sailors or coast guard personnel may be sent to board foreign ships confiscated by the United States, fly their original flags, and sail into non-war zones. Land stated that some foreign ships, if flying their national flags, can be chartered to travel at sea with lights off. Senator Vandenberg asked, "Do you believe that ships can fly foreign flags and travel at sea under the supervision of American sailors?" Land replied, "This is possible." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Opinions on British Shipping Losses Increasingly Divided</h3>
<p>Washington - The British Admiralty's release of merchant shipping loss figures for April has sparked a serious reaction here. Public opinion on this issue is becoming increasingly divided. According to political figures, those supporting the government are now trying to push public opinion to ensure that the government makes a decision on sending warships to escort vehicles to Britain as soon as possible. However, according to the figures released by the British Admiralty, the country's merchant shipping losses in April were only 301,070 tons, the lowest figure in the past eleven months, and most of them were sunk by the enemy in the Mediterranean. If this is the case, then this fact does not seem to be sufficient to justify the decision on the convoy method. These political figures acknowledge that Britain's monthly losses of this magnitude have greatly reduced the number of merchant ships available to Britain. As the U.S. shipbuilding program will not be able to reach its peak, it is necessary to find ways to maintain the existing tonnage. Unfortunately, the British Admiralty's communiqué is vague, causing American public opinion to become apprehensive. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government should clearly provide an explanation to ensure that the entire country unanimously decides to assist Britain with the U.S. fleet. For example, "The Washington Daily News" stated, "The British Admiralty admits that the situation in the Atlantic has also improved. Therefore, the focus of the problem is the heavy losses of British merchant ships in other areas, but not those carrying American military equipment in the Atlantic. If so, isn't this in fact contrary to the general American argument that military ships should be used to escort military equipment to Britain?" (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - The British shipping loss figures released in London yesterday arrived here too late, and newspapers did not have time to comment on them, but printed them in large print, leaving a deep impression on readers. A radio commentator said that the British side did not want to publish these figures immediately, but was forced to release them early due to pressure from the American situation. Senator Vandenberg's British shipping loss figures released on Wednesday, which implied limited British shipping losses in the Atlantic war, were cited by isolationists as proof that the United States does not need to continue to take action at sea. Now that it is known that Vandenberg's figures are incomplete, the British side's release of this truth will definitely be helpful to the U.S. Congress. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Million American Youths Called to Register</h3>
<p>Washington - Draft officials yesterday completed a notice calling for the registration of approximately one million young men who have reached their 21st birthday. This is the first time since registration in October last year. The notice is now awaiting President Roosevelt's signature. President Roosevelt will decide on the registration date, which is expected to be in July. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Continues to Announce Types of Embargoed Goods</h3>
<p>State Department Will Request Congressional Authorization to Extend Export Licensing System to the Philippines</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday ordered that, effective June 3, the following items be included under the export license system: Phaeosperma leaves (pharmaceuticals), Mentha arvensis (plant), vanadium, tantalum (both metallic elements), fluorite pillars (minerals), chemical wood flour, and Schizostylis (plant) seeds. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - Authoritative sources say that the State Department will soon ask Congress to authorize President Roosevelt to extend the export license system to the Philippines to prevent the shipment of chromium, manganese, hemp, and coconut oil to Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. The State Department believes that this measure is also a matter of national defense. These special goods are currently being shipped to Vladivostok in large quantities, and the government believes that their final destination is Germany. Once the export license system is implemented in the Philippines, important exports will be subject to strict control, and export licenses will not be granted for military raw materials suspected of being shipped to Germany. As for licenses for Japan and the Soviet Union, they will be strictly restricted. If the Soviet Union and Japan provide the United States with various economic and political conveniences on time, the United States will provide limited supplies to the Soviet Union and plug this loophole in the blockade line. Britain has long hoped for this, and the State Department's decision was made after consultation with the War Department. (International News Service, 11th)</p>
<h3>San Francisco Bay Area Machinists Strike; Affects National Defense Orders</h3>
<p>New York - The tide of national defense industry is becoming more uneasy. Nineteen hundred machinists in the San Francisco Bay Area are on strike, affecting national defense orders worth US$500 million, including four cruisers and twenty-seven destroyers. Although Secretary of the Navy Knox has loudly appealed to everyone to consider the importance of their work and to work as usual, the machinists have ignored him. Because these machinists are important, if the strike lasts until next week, it will make it impossible for another 25,000 shipbuilding machinists to work. Currently, there are a total of twenty-five strikes in various national defense industries, all small-scale strikes, with a total of 35,000 strikers. In addition, 61 manufacturing plants of General Motors Corporation are still threatened by strikes. 165,000 workers are demanding a wage increase of US$0.10 per hour. The company is undertaking national defense orders worth US$75 million. President Roosevelt may have to step in and submit the matter to public judgment. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador Gauss Passes Through Japan to China; Will Attend Meeting in Singapore with Key Figures from China, the Philippines, Australia, the Netherlands, Burma</h3>
<p>Kobe - The new U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, arrived here this morning aboard the President Garfield. Gauss reportedly told people that military and political personnel from the Philippines, Australia, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, and Chongqing will soon hold an important meeting in Singapore, but it is not yet known whether he himself will participate. Gauss is scheduled to go to Shanghai tonight. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Ambassador Kato Arrives in France</h3>
<p>Vichy - The new Japanese Ambassador to France, Kato, arrived here at 5:00 PM today. Marshal Petain's representative, Bauffre, greeted him at the station. Kato immediately met with reporters, made a statement, and strongly affirmed the friendly relations between France and Japan, saying that he firmly believes that although France is encountering unprecedented national difficulties, under the leadership of Marshal Petain, it will be able to revive and will certainly contribute to the work of establishing a new order and lasting peace in Western Europe. As for the various issues related to Vietnam, especially the French-Japanese economic negotiations, they have all been satisfactorily resolved. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Criticizes Roosevelt</h3>
<p>London - German radio said that the Berlin People's Front criticized President Roosevelt, pointing out that the North American president bears even more responsibility than Churchill. Judging from the documents found in Poland, one can see what kind of pressure Roosevelt's confidant Bullitt placed on the hesitant Chamberlain, forcing him to adopt an encirclement policy. This kind of pressure was especially evident after the Munich Conference. Therefore, it was the U.S. president and his promise of aid to Britain that made the war inevitable. Without the U.S. president, Churchill would never have been appointed prime minister. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia declared today that the U.S. government has decided to go to war with the Axis powers. The newspaper called on the American people to oppose this decision, otherwise they should bear part of the responsibility for the final outcome. At the same time, the Italian press and officials firmly believe that the U.S. is now heading towards a de facto war. (International News Service, 11th)</p>
<h3>Vietnam Has Become an Axis Nation; A Latent Arsenal in the Far East</h3>
<p>Fifty German Experts Depart for Vietnam; Economic Matters Will Be Controlled by Japan</p>
<p>London - It was learned yesterday from reliable sources that since the signing of the economic treaty on May 6 and the political treaty on May 9, Vietnam has actually become a dependency of Japan. The treaty of May 9 is a supplement to the treaty signed on September 23 last year. Washington protested against the treaty signed last year. The Vichy government has guaranteed that it will not participate in any agreement that conflicts with Japan's development. According to the aforementioned treaties, Japan has been able to import its main goods into Vietnam duty-free. Japanese investments in Japanese industries can be recognized as having the same status as French capital industries, including agriculture and mining. Industrial conferences will be held at any time, at which time Japan will decide to adjust and control all economic matters. Thereafter, financial measures will be based on the Japanese yen. Furthermore, a German technical team is rushing to this latent Axis arsenal in the Far East. Fifty experts left Berlin for Vietnam on May 8. (International News Service, 11th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Current Phase of U.S.-Japan Relations</h3>
<p>With the rapidly changing European situation, U.S. convoys are inevitable. Recalling that when the Lend-Lease Act was being discussed in the U.S. Congress in February, convoys were prohibited and even listed as one of the provisions. In a short time, there has been a significant shift in opinion in both the government and the public. It can be seen that the issue of U.S. participation in the war, as pointed out in yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, is at least 50% mature, and its realization is only a matter of time. The expansion of the war is not a welcome event, but at a time when the crime of aggression threatens all of humanity, what should be most condemned is not war, but the aggressor's conquest of the world without a fight. Even if we speculate towards the worst future, at the very least, the futures of Greece and the Netherlands are more promising than those of Denmark and Romania.</p>
<p>In terms of the recent situation, it is clear that the situation on the other side of the Atlantic is causing the United States greater concern. Whether it is convoys or participation in the war, both are directly aimed at the Axis powers. Up to this point, the U.S. authorities have not revealed what steps they will take regarding their allies after an open break with Germany and Italy. The Nazi forces indeed laid a chess piece in the Far East as early as September last year to contain the United States. This used to be sensational, but it has gradually faded with the passage of time. Recently, some Japanese have indeed spoken of their determination to fulfill their Axis obligations to the United States, and it even came from the mouth of a Foreign Ministry spokesperson; however, amidst all the complex arguments about adjusting U.S.-Japan relations, such as Matsuoka's visit to the United States and Roosevelt and Hull's visit to Japan, there is clearly a sense of loneliness. There is no need to discern whether there is sincerity or pretense, nor to delve into whether it is a test. It can be seen that Japan's concern about the movements on the other side of the Pacific is just as anxious as its inability to end the "China Incident."</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese public opinion has suddenly emphasized the view that Japan cannot conquer China by force. Guangzhi Bao and others have even gone further and considered ways to end the "China Incident." The fact that China cannot be conquered by force is a fact that has long been recognized by the world, and even Japanese officials and the public have repeatedly expressed their recognition of the truth of this understanding. Recently, Honda Kumatarō, who was stationed in Nanjing by Japan, vehemently criticized the Japanese side's advocacy of "direct negotiations" before returning to Japan. One can see that there are currently some disputes among the Japanese side about how to "resolve the China Incident." The opinions suggested by Guangzhi Bao are probably the targets opposed by Honda. From this, it can be seen that the germination of the so-called peace offensive has already formed a problem in Japan. The actual effect of this is not much to be argued, and is probably just like the criticism from Washington, just expressing Japan's one-sided desire. However, its germination at a time when it is fully focused on the United States can at least prove that the current Japanese authorities' views on China and the United States are like two intersecting straight lines, and it is now trying to grasp the intersection of the two lines in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Tokyo's sudden activity regarding the attitude of the United States is not only stimulated by the Soviet-Japanese Treaty, but also by the influence of the international situation. The explanation of this point in the United Press Tokyo news ten days ago is noteworthy. It said that Japan's recent gestures towards the United States are probably based on the report and encouragement of its ambassador to the United States, Nomura, who said that the United States' main concern is in Europe, so resolving the Pacific issue is not hopeless. The same news also said: Japan intends to negotiate a new commercial treaty with the United States to replace the abolished old treaty. Some people believe that this can only be done if Japan makes considerable concessions to China. These are generally fantasies, but they are one of the main reasons why the Japanese side suddenly launched a peace offensive at this time. The other day, Matsuoka expressed his determination to use diplomatic means to "resolve the China Incident," while China and Foreign Commercial News criticized the U.S. for recognizing China as a democratic country as absurd. Comparing the two, the message is not difficult to understand. In short, Japan believes that the United States' attention has been largely drawn to the European war and that it has no intention of taking action in the Pacific for the time being. This is a good opportunity for Japan to implement a peaceful southward advance and a good opportunity to resolve the China Incident. As long as the United States does not interfere or hinder Japan's actions, Japan may not be unable to provide the United States with certain guarantees.</p>
<p>After the Dutch East Indies and Japan signed the oil agreement, London expressed an optimistic view, saying that the situation in the Pacific has unexpectedly improved, and specifically mentioned the special clause in the Tripartite Pact that Japan does not have to participate in the war after the U.S. and Germany go to war. This optimism is dangerous. Of course, the current Japan is quite cautious about the issue of participation in the war and will not make a decision until it is absolutely advantageous, but if the Tripartite Pact really has that secret clause, then it is precisely the basis for Japan to bargain with the democratic countries, which is what its aforementioned fantasy is based on. However, no one believes that the United States' unshakeable position on the Far East is just like China's own unshakeable resistance to aggression. The other day, there were rumors that Britain had used diplomatic means in the Far East, but Eden's powerful statement denying the closure of the Burma Road proves that those rumors are absurd. Britain is unwilling to abandon its obligation to assist Greece in order to avoid its own difficulties, and the United States, which emphasizes ideals more than the British people, will not lightly commit the crime of breaching its trust. There is no need to worry too much about this point, but it is a pity that the Far East has not been able to break the aggressor's tentacles before the European situation became tense. However, although the United States today attaches great importance to Europe, it will not relax its grip on the East. With its inexhaustible power, it is believed that once the storm in the Pacific also fluctuates with the European situation, the United States still holds several powerful and effective weapons in its hands.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of Japanese Troops Invade Border Between Shanxi and Henan; 200,000 Chinese Troops Immediately Respond; General Wei Lihuang Personally Commands the Front Lines; Fierce Battles Have Continued for Days in the Suburbs of Yuanqu and Jiyuan</h3>
<p>Luoyang - The situation in Zhongtiao Mountain has become tense due to the Japanese invasion of Yuanqu, and a major battle is about to break out. Tens of thousands of Japanese troops invaded from the Hengling Pass and Gaoluozhen Avenue in the south. Japanese troops from Xiaxian and Qinshui also advanced towards the east and west sides. On the 8th and 9th, fierce battles broke out on all fronts. The Japanese launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army under the cover of intense artillery fire, poison gas, and air force. The Chinese army resisted bravely, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Currently, due to the terrain in Tanqu, the Chinese army has retreated to a favorable area and continues to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army. (10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A major battle broke out on the border between Shanxi and Henan on the 7th. The Japanese army, numbering tens of thousands, invaded Yuanqu from the various foothills of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, while a part invaded Zhiyuan from Wenxian and Mengxian in northern Henan. Their ultimate goal was to cross the Yellow River and invade the western section of the Longhai Railway. The Chinese army was prepared and has mobilized a large force of 200,000 to immediately respond. General Wei Lihuang personally went to supervise the battle. Fierce battles took place in the suburbs of Tanqu and Jiyuan yesterday. The Chinese army's positions along the Yellow River have been completely deployed for many years, making them impregnable. The Japanese army will never succeed. (10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military news, the fighting in the northern region is becoming more and more intense. More than 7,000 Japanese troops around Fenyang City to the outskirts of Jiyuan have been largely reinforced and invaded Jiyuan City on the afternoon of the 8th. Japanese troops from Mengxian continued to invade Beibaiban on the afternoon of the 8th. On the same day, at dusk, the two Japanese troops joined forces to invade Fengmenkou. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack with subsequent troops joining in the Xichengliu area. As of the 9th, the Chinese and Japanese troops were still fighting fiercely in the area east of Fengmenkou. The Japanese troops invading along the Henggao Avenue were strongly blocked by the Chinese, and suffered heavy casualties. On the 8th, the Japanese army continued to use aircraft to bomb all day and released a large amount of smoke screen, and the Chinese army was forced to transfer. The Japanese army was able to invade Yuanqu. Now the Chinese and Japanese armies are still fighting fiercely in the mountainous area of Banjian River to the west of Yuanqu. About 3,000 Japanese troops near Dangyang invaded Yuanan in separate groups via Shimachao, Yinzigang, Jiuligang, and Weijiagang on the 7th. After being blocked by the Chinese army, they are still fighting fiercely in the suburbs. The Japanese troops invading Zaolin Township from Qingmiao Town were blocked by the Chinese army and retreated from Taishan Temple to Tangxian Town. The Japanese troops from Tangwangdian continued to invade Baijiazhuang and Liujiagang. After being bravely counterattacked by the Chinese army, hundreds were killed and wounded. Currently, they are in a fierce battle. Another Japanese army invaded Jingmingpu from Taishan Temple and was intercepted by the Chinese, and the Japanese failed to succeed. A part of the Japanese army in Suixian invaded Lishan in the north on the morning of the 8th and is fighting fiercely with the Chinese army. (10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to sources close to this, the Japanese army, totaling at least three divisions, has concentrated in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, apparently intending to cross the Yellow River. If the Japanese army actually crosses the river, it will be the first time since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. According to reports, the Japanese army may attempt to cross the river near Mengxian, which is about twenty miles northeast of Luoyang and is a famous shallow crossing. However, the Japanese army may also cross the river near Sishui, about thirty miles west of Zhengzhou. In addition, there seems to be a development indicating that the Japanese army may advance towards Hancheng Town, sixty miles north of Tongguan. Currently, the Japanese army is attacking the Chinese army's positions in Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi and the towns in northern Henan north of the Yellow River, apparently intending to consolidate the rear before crossing the river.

<h3>Air Raid on Chongqing Causes Minimal Damage</h3>
<p>Chongqing The first week of bombing in Chongqing has revealed very few casualties and extremely minor property damage so far. The downtown area of Chongqing is almost entirely undamaged. More importantly, the number of attacking Japanese planes is fewer than last year and even two years ago. Last week's Japanese bombing seemed to be concentrated in the western suburbs. Although a few bombs fell on the downtown commercial area on May 3, the downtown area along the Yangtze River on the 9th, and the north bank of the Jialing Estuary yesterday, most of the bombs from the three bombings fell in the western suburbs. During the air raids on Friday and Saturday, bombs fell near the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the house was so badly damaged that it was almost uninhabitable. Because the houses in the western suburbs are scattered, most of the bombs fell in open spaces. Except for the shops and houses on the main roads, the damage to other houses was minimal, and the number of casualties was also very limited. Only in the bombing on May 9, many bombs fell along the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, causing the deaths of many boatmen. When Japanese planes attacked last year and two years ago, Chinese fighter planes took off to fight back, but this year no fighters have been seen taking off to intercept. The Chinese defense relies entirely on anti-aircraft fire, which is not very effective because the Japanese planes are mostly at an altitude of over 70 feet. Air-raid shelters have also been very effective. Although a few bombs directly hit the side of the shelters yesterday, and the entrance was almost blocked, all the people taking refuge were unharmed. After the air raid, everyone left the shelters and returned home without any difficulty. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union's Attitude Unfathomable; Sooner or Later Involvement Inevitable; Based on Its Own Interests and Ideology; Rumors of Meeting Between German and Soviet Leaders Soon</h3>
<p>London The "Times" diplomatic correspondent stated that Moscow's cancellation of recognition of the embassies of Belgium, Norway, and Yugoslavia at this time is likely due to two reasons: (1) Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, taking over the reins of power, means that he may participate in important diplomatic talks soon, given the emergency situation. These diplomatic talks can only be with Germany. In order to clear the barriers between the Soviet and German nations, Stalin has removed major diplomatic obstacles. (2) The recent actions may be a broad hint to the British government, as Britain has not yet recognized the Soviet Union's annexation of several Baltic countries. The Soviet Union considers this to be a major obstacle to improving British-Soviet relations. The "Times" reporter in the Swedish capital commented on Stalin's assumption of the premiership, saying that at a time when Europe is at war, Stalin's position gives him greater power to issue orders than as leader of the Communist Party. Stalin's assumption of the premiership has given him control of two important levers to deal with any eventuality. Stalin's "promotion" can be seen as reflecting his view that the Soviet Union's participation in the war is not unlikely, and that he has decided to personally be the true and formal head of a government that administers according to the Stalinist constitution. The question then arises: on which side will the Soviet Union join the war? The answer is that the Soviet Union's participation in the war is not for any side, but for its own interests and ideology. Then, which side will it attack? The answer is that, judging from the borders lined up in Poland and Romania, and other subtle signs, it does not intend to directly attack Britain, and Stalin will not easily do so unless he confirms that war is inevitable. As for whether he will preemptively strike, or allow Hitler to choose the timing and location to attack at his leisure, the "News Chronicle" and the "Daily Herald" both carried news that Hitler is now planning to meet with Stalin. The "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent stated that Hitler will propose in this meeting to allow the Soviet Union complete freedom of action in all of Asia, including India and Japan, and to give the Soviet Union an outlet to the Persian Gulf through Iran. The Soviet Union must guarantee that it will not change its current borders in Europe. Economically, Germany will ask the Soviet Union to allow it to purchase large quantities of Soviet raw materials, especially wheat from Ukraine and oil from the Caucasus, in exchange for German machinery and heavy industrial products. Stalin knows that Germany's preparations to attack the Soviet Union are complete. If Hitler's proposal contains appropriate promises to guarantee the Soviet Union's security and expand its influence, it is believed that Stalin will accept it. Otherwise, there is no other way to resolve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany except to resort to force. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London According to the Sunday Dispatch, Hitler met with Stalin on a ship in the Black Sea several weeks ago. Hitler declared that if Germany could not obtain the Soviet Union's cooperation, Germany would attack Ukraine. It is rumored that Stalin is prepared to satisfy Hitler's demands.

<h3>German-Soviet War to Break Out in Summer; U.S. Associated Press Reports Indications</h3>
<p>Istanbul During my (self-proclaimed special correspondent for this agency, Peters) two-day tour of Romania, I had conversations with local dignitaries. They predicted that the Soviet-German war would break out in June. Romania's two newest passenger ships, the "Basarabia" and the "Transylvania," have been converted into armed cruisers, equipped with 150-mm guns. Romania has been occupied by Germany for eight months. The country now hopes that the Soviet-German war will lead to the transfer of 750,000 German troops. When I was in Romania, local dignitaries all expressed the belief that the Soviet-German war would break out in June. Some even said that German troops would enter the Soviet cities of Kiev and Odessa on June 15. Others predicted that German troops would be able to occupy Moscow in the summer. A high-ranking source said that the Soviet Union had moved the telephone equipment in Kishinev and had evacuated all metal objects from Bessarabia. When the Soviet people withdrew from the Dniester, they also drove the cattle away with them. I also learned that six German submarines had sailed down the Danube River and concentrated in the Black Sea. The Soviet Union has sent 24 submarines from the North Sea. It is said that German sailors have appeared in the Romanian capital. It is believed that more German ships will arrive in the future. (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Anniversary of German Offensive on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Berlin Today is the first anniversary of the start of the German offensive on the Western Front. Newspapers here have published commentaries, all stating that Germany has not only achieved a decisive military victory in Western Europe, but has also had major political consequences.

The "Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger" stated that Germany's interests related to its survival had been demanded in the past by peaceful means, but were resolutely rejected. Now, after a year of struggle by Germany, it has been recognized by all countries. In addition, the "General Anzeiger" stated that the German troops' crossing of the border and launching an offensive on May 10 last year was a revolutionary act, the purpose of which was entirely to transform Europe, and that Churchill and his ilk were still obsessed and self-righteous, and could only be defeated by this kind of revolutionary action." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Lyon Today is the first anniversary of the German attack on the Western Front. The "Petit Parisien" newspaper recently published a commentary stating that on this day last year, Germany attacked our country. At this moment, we can only learn a lesson, but we must not be discouraged. Our country's failure was due to years of accumulated problems, and history will make its own judgment. Through this battle, we should understand that the so-called total war can cause popular unrest, damage transportation, and demoralize morale. The spirit of our army has not been defeated, but the mechanized units are coming in a torrent, which cannot be resisted by human power. Fortunately, although our country has been defeated today, it still maintains its honor." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Spain Sets Up Cannons to Threaten Gibraltar, Waiting for the Opportunity to Block the Mediterranean; Spanish Administrative Institutions Reformed and Renewed</h3>
<p>New York, United Press: According to reliable private European sources, Spain has completed the construction of its defensive lines at Algeciras and Tangier. The cannons installed are aimed at the Mediterranean Sea, ready to block the Strait of Gibraltar at any time. However, it is reported that General Franco will not decide to block the western mouth of the Mediterranean unless the German army occupies the Suez Canal and controls the eastern mouth of the Mediterranean. Hitler recently invited Franco to join the Axis, but the Spanish leader politely declined with well-known reasons, stating that Spain deeply wishes to maintain its current stance and will determine its course of action after Germany occupies the Suez Canal. (United Press dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish political situation has taken a sharp turn, with staunch supporters of the Franco faction suddenly seizing power and assuming important government positions. The reasons for this have not been explained. Valentín Galarza has been appointed Minister of the Interior, and the Falange Party's (i.e., Spanish Fascist) newspaper has been placed under government censorship. Other key appointments made on Friday include Cabanillas as Superintendent of National Security, Figuerola as Governor of Madrid Province (formerly the son of the former dictator Primo de Rivera), Yluruendi as Undersecretary of the Interior, and Sartova as Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (United Press dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Political figures here recently stated that General Franco's recent partial cabinet reshuffle and the replacement of provincial governors in Madrid and other provinces are part of measures to reform the existing administrative institutions. After this cabinet reshuffle, General Franco has obtained absolute power to control the Spanish state. However, there will be no changes in Spain's domestic or foreign policy. Suñer remains the Foreign Minister, solely obeying the orders of the Head of State. Therefore, this move only signifies that Spain is entering a new stage of national construction.

<p>London: Last night, the moonlight was clear, and enemy planes carried out attacks over London with great intensity, similar to the night of April 19th. Enemy planes came in successive waves, with the sound of exploding bombs and anti-aircraft guns echoing in the moonlit sky. Enemy planes first dropped incendiary bombs and then high-explosive bombs, with the offensive becoming increasingly fierce. Enemy planes dropped bombs indiscriminately at low altitude. However, London watchmen and firefighters still went out to serve. A large bomb fell in the city, injuring several people. Last night, a passenger train on British Railways was strafed by enemy planes, seriously injuring many people. The driver stopped the train and returned to a nearby station to avoid it. The driver later died of his injuries in the hospital. It is reported that four enemy planes were shot down in yesterday's air raid. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>London: London this morning suffered the most severe air raid since April. As this correspondent writes, German planes are still soaring over the British capital, dropping no fewer than several thousand incendiary bombs and hundreds of high-explosive bombs, causing new damage to the battered London and countless civilian casualties. Molotov bread baskets and incendiary bombs fell like hail on streets and houses, with the explosion of bombs and the intense firing of anti-aircraft guns creating a terrifying situation. (United Press dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>London: An Air Ministry communiqué has confirmed that 33 enemy planes were destroyed last night and acknowledged that casualties and losses were very significant in the air raid on London.

<h3>British Naval and Air Forces Jointly Attack Benghazi Port, Two Supply Ships Sunk, Desert Scorching Hot, Fighting at a Standstill</h3>
<p>London: A British Admiralty communiqué stated that on Thursday morning, British warships attacked Benghazi port, hitting enemy ships.

(Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Cairo: The British Middle East Air Force yesterday announced that British planes heavily attacked Benghazi and other places in Libya on the night of the 8th, causing numerous fires. On the same night, both the road east of Tobruk and the road north of Bardia were bombed, damaging the roads and destroying motor transport convoys. The Amba Alagi fortress in Abyssinia was heavily attacked by British planes, with many direct hits. South African squadrons repeatedly attacked places still held by Italian troops, paying particular attention to motor transport convoys and enemy troop concentrations. Enemy planes attacked ships near Malta, but were intercepted by British fighters, resulting in one enemy plane being shot down into the sea. In the above-mentioned battles, the British lost only one plane. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Cairo: There is no important war news to report in North Africa's Libya, but the British mechanized units are still engaged in active patrols in Sollum. The British forces in Abyssinia, advancing on Amba Alagi from the north and south, have continued to make progress, capturing several enemy soldiers. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Cairo: The indoor temperature in Cairo has now reached 111 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heat in the desert suburbs can be imagined. The reason why today's British communiqué stated that there was nothing important to report in the Tobruk area is likely due to this. If the climate in Libya is also like this, the scorching sun will make even tanks almost untouchable. There is currently light rain in Abyssinia, making the roads temporarily muddy and difficult to travel, and the fighting has quieted down slightly. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>France Will Not Abandon Its Mandate Over Syria; Vichy Aviation Minister to Meet with Weygand in North Africa</h3>
<p>Vichy: An official spokesperson yesterday denied that France has abandoned its rule over Syria or its League of Nations mandate. According to news from Istanbul, Syrian students held demonstrations celebrating "France's abandonment of its rule over Syria." The news stated that "Syrian students believe that France has no right to rule Syria because France has lost its League of Nations mandate since withdrawing from the League." The spokesperson refuted this, saying that according to League of Nations rules, although France has withdrawn from the League, it still has obligations to the League for two years. Therefore, at least for two years, the mandate should not be a problem. The spokesperson also pointed out that although Japan withdrew from the League long ago, it still has a mandate over the German-owned islands in the Pacific. The French have recently encouraged the new Syrian government to prepare for the establishment of a constitution. (United Press dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<h3>Vichy Promulgates New Law, Strictly Enforcing Anti-Semitism</h3>
<p>Vichy: French Head of State Pétain issued an order in today's official gazette, establishing a loan of 2,065,000 francs for the formulation of anti-Jewish laws and for the office expenses of senior officials in charge of Jewish affairs. These Jewish affairs officials have recently been assumed by Vallat, and their office is located in the former Rothschild Bank in Paris. According to news from Paris, the occupying authorities have adopted stricter new measures against Jews in Paris and the occupied provinces, especially against foreign Jews. The means to prohibit Jews from holding various businesses was not mentioned in previous regulations. Influenced by German forces, Vichy is preparing to implement new anti-Jewish laws and has already applied them to recent plans. These new plans will be implemented on May 20th and prohibit Jews from engaging in the following economic activities: (1) wholesale, (2) retail, (3) hotels, (4) restaurants, (5) insurance, (6) advertising, (7) travel, (8) various guidance or transportation industries, including rental cars, (9) pawnbroking, (10) shipping, (11) warehousing, (12) land, sea, and air transportation, (13) banking, (14) exchange business, (15) police or detectives, (16) intelligence agency personnel, (17) tax collection agencies, (18) marriage registration business, (19) rental business, (20) employment agency. However, the news industry is not prohibited. In addition, Jews may not be shop assistants, or engage in agency businesses, or other intermediary businesses related to buying and selling. Furthermore, Jews cannot engage in certain businesses or jobs that can be performed by non-Jews, nor can they work to share profits. According to the new plan, Jews who are dismissed may not request compensation for losses from their employers, and employers may not compensate them. Employers who violate the new plan and compensate dismissed Jews for losses will be severely punished. Positions vacated by Jews should be filled by Aryans. Aryan company authorities may sell or dispose of shares owned by Jews in the company. After Jewish capital is sold or disposed of, Aryan company authorities must not give Jews large sums of money, only allowing them a certain amount of essential living expenses. This new law is stricter than previous laws, because it also stipulates that anyone who converts to Judaism or marries a Jew should be considered Jewish. Anyone whose three generations of ancestors were Jewish is considered a pure Jew, even if the Jew has left Judaism and converted to Christianity, they should still be considered Jewish. In short, this new law has made it impossible for Jews to engage in any economic activities and has reduced the status of Jews to be equal to those working in the fields and factories.

<h3>Anniversary of Nazi Invasion of the Netherlands; Queen Wilhelmina Calls on Her People to Unite and Fight for Freedom</h3>
<p>London: Queen Wilhelmina broadcasted last night, expressing her confidence in the final victory and her gratitude for the assistance of the English people. The Queen first spoke to the Dutch people, saying that the Netherlands' resistance has become more united and determined, with everyone working hard to fight. The enemy is destroying international law and human rights, while we are persevering and bravely resisting tirelessly. Both the eastern and western parts of the Greater Netherlands are extremely willing to help their compatriots at home and are prepared to sacrifice everything to achieve this goal. At the same time, President Roosevelt and the American people will not rest until victory is achieved. In her second broadcast, Queen Wilhelmina expressed her gratitude to the English people for their assistance, saying that although Hitler invaded the land of the Dutch people, he could not destroy the spirit of the Dutch people. Even in the occupied areas, there is resistance, with the absolute belief that any negotiations or compromises with the enemy are impossible, because the enemy only knows how to use lies as a tool of its policy and relies on the secret police for its rule.

<h3>First Batch of Hong Kong Rice Arrives Yesterday; Rice Shops Responsible for Retail; Quality Same as Shanghai's Small-Grain Rice; Price of Foreign Rice Also Plummets</h3>
<p>Rice Prices to be Reassessed After Hong Kong Rice is Available on the Market</p>
<p>The first batch of 5,000 tons (i.e., 50,000 bags) of Hong Kong rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been brought to Shanghai by the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Mingsheng and Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's Hanyang. The first to arrive was the Mingsheng, which docked at the Xinkaihe Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession at 1:30 PM. The Hanyang arrived at 2:30 PM and docked at the Bund on Avenue Edward VII. The two ships carried approximately 30,000 bags of Hong Kong rice. Unloading began that day and is expected to be completed this morning. It is reported that another 20,000 bags of Hong Kong rice will be transported to Shanghai today by the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Excellent Quality, Ready for Sale</p>
<p>A reporter from the Great China News Agency inspected the two ships yesterday afternoon and saw that the small-grain rice was indeed no different in quality from the 40-grain small-grain rice sold on the market. Yesterday was Sunday, and the godowns were closed for cargo release, so it is expected that the companies that ordered this Hong Kong rice will start going to release the cargo today. The Leki Trading Company, which is handling this Hong Kong rice, has completed all the sales procedures yesterday and is expected to distribute it to various shops for sale. Citizens who wish to purchase this Hong Kong rice can buy it from nearby rice shops. The price is set at 110 National Currency per picul, with no restrictions on time or quantity.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong Jointly Prevent Manipulation</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the British Taikoo and Jardine ships sailing to Hong Kong will carry Hong Kong rice purchased by the authorities to Shanghai at any time. Currently, in addition to allowing the free export of rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Hong Kong government has implemented a permit system for other merchants purchasing Hong Kong rice. Anyone who does not have this permit is prohibited from exporting it. This measure is to prevent someone from manipulating the market for profit. It is also reported that the Municipal Council's purchase of Hong Kong rice from the Hong Kong government was able to be implemented quickly and smoothly thanks to the shipping industry in this city voluntarily reducing freight rates significantly.</p>
<p>Rice Profiteers' Skills Exhausted, Market Stabilizes</p>
<p>According to general observations, some large hoarders made a final struggle in the rice market last weekend, using the Hong Kong government's control of rice as an excuse to spread rumors, causing the price of rice per picul to be illegally raised by three or four yuan. However, Hong Kong rice has now arrived in Shanghai and is ready for sale. Even if rice profiteers can illegally raise the price of rice, citizens can refuse to buy from them. Moreover, the Hong Kong authorities' control of rice is actually aimed at dealing with rice profiteers and is absolutely beneficial to the supply of rice in this city. Therefore, to this day, all the tricks used by rice profiteers have completely failed. Therefore, the price of rice is bound to continue to fall today, and the rice market will become increasingly stable thereafter, which is undoubtedly the case.</p>
<p>Rice Prices to be Reassessed, Soon to be Implemented</p>
<p>It was previously rumored that the authorities of the two concessions, in order to alleviate the suffering of the common people and maintain social order, would re-evaluate the new price limits for rice on the 10th of this month and implement them effectively. Regardless of domestic or foreign rice, the standard price limit of 110 yuan per picul (160 catties) must not be exceeded from that day onwards. Now, it is again rumored in this city that the new price limit for rice has been postponed due to the low-priced Hong Kong rice not arriving early. However, the emotions of the residents of this city who are eagerly anticipating the authorities to re-establish the new price limit for rice have been evident. It is hoped that the authorities will expedite its implementation.</p>
<p>Price of Foreign Rice Plummets Along with Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries were made with various foreign rice companies, and it was learned that the price of rice in Saigon, Siam, Yangon and other rice-producing areas had also gradually increased. Because the price of rice in Shanghai was high, the rice merchants there also took the opportunity to raise prices for profit. At that time, rice merchants in this city stopped adding to their supplies due to the high price of foreign rice, which increased costs, causing the price of rice in this city to rise higher and higher. Because the price of rice in Shanghai has plummeted, the price of rice in the above-mentioned rice-producing areas has also fallen one after another. A certain firm received a notice from Yangon the day before yesterday: "The ordered rice has been shipped, and the price of rice continues to plummet." According to another source, the number of ships can gradually increase in the future.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Plan to Reorganize Market Rules</p>
<p>The rice merchant's tea market on Fuzhou Road and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake exchange on Avenue Edward VII have repeatedly adjusted the rice trading rules in the market and strengthened the organizational structure by the relevant industry associations. However, due to the general speculative merchants' insincere compliance and attempts to sabotage, there have been no great results. Market transactions are still quite chaotic and disorganized. Although there are clear regulations, rice profiteers simply ignore them. It is now learned that the rice market management committee and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry association, in order to make the market trading under their jurisdiction on the right track, have decided to re-discuss the market rules strictly, with the principle of making it convenient for companies to buy and sell and easy to comply with. They are currently in the process of consultation.</p>
<h3>US Overseas Trade Week Approaching: China and the US Celebrate Together; American Chamber of Commerce to Host Students Studying in America and Hold Impromptu Speeches on Sino-US Relations</h3>
<p>The 19th of this month, next Monday, is US Overseas Trade Week. Under the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce, American expatriates in Shanghai will commemorate "US Overseas Trade Week" during the week of the 19th to the 25th. US authorities have designated the 19th as "International Goodwill Monday." The American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of expatriates will hold grand celebrations separately.</p>
<p>Holding a Luncheon</p>
<p>However, given the current international situation, authorities do not intend to be extravagant. A luncheon will be held only at the American Clubhouse. As Sino-US relations are becoming increasingly friendly, the American Chamber of Commerce will host Chinese students going to the US this year, accompanied by more than ten students from American schools and their families. A grand banquet will be held that evening to entertain American expatriates in Shanghai. This year, as American expatriates have been ordered to return home one after another, the event will not be as grand as in previous years.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart; Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford; retired Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, Colonel Baker; the new commander, Howard; US Acting Commercial Attaché in China, Mr. Grand; US Assessor in China, Mr. Hamilick; and Mr. Smith of the American Chamber of Commerce will all attend the celebrations and deliver speeches on "Sino-US Relations," chaired by Mr. Smith of the American Chamber of Commerce. At 10:00 AM that morning, a special service will be held at the Grand Theater, presided over by Chaplain Choplin of the Fourth Marine Regiment, with a film screening to add to the occasion.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Prices to be Reduced</h3>
<p>The price of machine-made coal briquettes once reached a peak. Speculators hoarded existing coal briquettes, raising the factory price to 296 yuan per ton. The retail price was 16 yuan per "dan" (100 market catties). At that time, the black market was still rampant, with coal briquettes exceeding 300 yuan per ton. This has been going on for over a month. According to news from various coal industry associations, the supply of coal dust is now abundant, and market prices are gradually falling, having dropped by more than 30 yuan per ton in recent days. The cost of manufacturing coal briquettes has been reduced, and various machine-made coal briquette factories are preparing to reduce prices. Those holding inventory are uneasy and are scrambling to unload their stockpiles, leading to mutual undercutting. The black market is loosening, and there is hope for a sharp drop in prices in the coming days. Furthermore, the market price of smokeless white coal chunks has also been gradually decreasing. Large quantities of coal chunks are expected to arrive in port sequentially in the middle of this month.</p>
<h3>Latvian Residents Celebrate National Day</h3>
<p>Although the national situation is different from the past, Latvian residents in this city will still celebrate the 17th anniversary of the government's founding on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Commemorating Hu Hanmin and Chen Qimei: Promoting the Martyrs' Legacy, Emulating the Martyrs' Spirit, and Devoting Loyalty to the Party and the Nation</h3>
<p>May 12th is the memorial day for Mr. Hu Hanmin, a senior member of the Kuomintang who sacrificed his life for the country. Various offices in this city have decided to hold solemn commemorations separately. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Death</p>
<p>Today is the memorial day for the death of Mr. Hu Hanmin, the former President of the Legislative Yuan. Due to the special circumstances, various circles in this city have not held memorial ceremonies since the war, but only spiritual commemorations, recalling Mr. Hu's lifelong dedication to the National Revolution, following the late Premier, braving difficulties, and supporting the Northern Expedition. His perseverance and lifelong words and deeds are truly worthy of being a model for the people. In order to express the admiration of later generations for the virtuous, it is decided to mourn with deep sorrow and devote efforts to Mr. Hu's unfinished legacy, making it shine brightly as a revolutionary model.</p>
<p>Chen Qimei's Martyrdom</p>
<p>May 18th is the memorial day for the martyr Mr. Chen Qimei. In the past, various circles would lower the flag to half-mast and hold gatherings on this day. After the war, due to the circumstances, these gatherings were suspended. However, in order to commemorate Mr. Chen's revolutionary spirit and patriotic enthusiasm, although no extravagant gatherings will be held, it is decided to commemorate this martyr with the same spirit, silently recalling Mr. Chen's lifelong deeds, emulating his perseverance, and dedicating loyalty to the country to strive for the final victory.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Commander Xie: Held Yesterday Morning; Limited Number of Attendees, Notice Not Widely Distributed; Hundreds of Representatives from Various Groups Attended</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Commander Xie Jinyuan was held at his camp yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Due to the limited number of attendees, only the camp sent out invitations to various groups, with each group sending two representatives, totaling 350 people. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department specially dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to maintain strict security in the Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road area. Italian sailors were also deployed for defense. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue</p>
<p>The entire arrangement of the memorial service: at the entrance, there was a white silk crepe archway, about four "zhang" (over 13 meters) high, with a Kuomintang emblem made of white and blue colors on top, and a white bamboo cloth banner below, reading "Memorial Service for the Late Commander Xie." From there to the venue, about fifty steps, both sides were lined with bamboo racks forming a passage, covered with mourning banners and funeral streamers. The arrangement of the venue was the same as before, with an archway also erected in front of the door. Inside the venue, plain curtains were hung all around. An altar was set up in the front, with clear wine and sacrificial offerings, and white candles were lit. A portrait of Mr. Xie was hung above, and the coffin was placed in the middle, covered with the national flag of Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth. The national flags were hung on the back wall. A blue neon light in the shape of the character "奠" (diàn - offering) was placed in the center. The wreaths and funeral streamers donated by various circles were displayed in five rooms. In the open space outside the venue, there was a full-length portrait of Mr. Xie, over two "zhang" (over 6.5 meters) high, painted by artists Ran Xi and Gu Tingkang.

<h3>Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices; Loan Collateral Suspended; Fear of Repeating Last Year's Mistakes</h3>
<p>Yarn prices have plummeted in recent days, and banks have suspended loans secured by cotton yarn to avoid risk. According to reports from Datong News Agency, there is a large amount of cotton yarn stockpiled in this city, exceeding 300,000 bales. Previously, speculators manipulated the prices, raising them to over 1,500 yuan per bale, with a total value of over 450 million yuan. However, sales to other ports have almost completely ceased, leading to a price decline. Banks are concerned about the cotton yarn's loan, as its selling has greatly narrowed, for fear of repeating last year's mistakes, when yarn prices plummeted from over 1,500 yuan to 800 or 900 yuan, and many yarn stores went bankrupt. The banks deemed the risk of cotton yarn collateral too great. Besides, the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and money is becoming tight. Therefore, they have all suspended loans secured by cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Tang Receives Enthusiastic Social Assistance; Over 100,000 Yuan Donated in Four Months; Still Short 90,000 Yuan, Hoping to Accumulate Every Bit</h3>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang in the Nanshi area is a well-known Catholic charity. Since its founding, it has been in operation for 28 years. The hall, located on Guohuo Road, covers an area of over 100 "mu" (over 6.6 hectares), with magnificent buildings and perfect facilities. It is divided into an orphanage, an infant home, and a nursing home, and also provides care for disabled orphans, free medical treatment for the poor and sick, etc. The number of orphans who have been educated and become adults, the elderly and disabled who have enjoyed their old age, and the poor and sick who have benefited from it, are countless. Its contribution to society is self-evident. Recently, due to lack of funds and soaring prices, the hall's current situation is gradually approaching a dead end, especially the food supply, which is difficult to plan. It is likely to affect the continuation of the lives of nearly a thousand orphans and elderly people. Therefore, it is necessary to appeal to all sectors. This newspaper, in fulfilling its social responsibility, is happy to appeal to readers for donations. Fortunately, the enthusiastic response from all sectors has been quite considerable. The hall has prepared a report as follows:</p>
<p>Donation Achievements</p>
<p>Since this newspaper appealed to society on its behalf, donations from all sectors have been very enthusiastic. Some have generously donated large sums of money, some have taken on monthly donations, some have saved money from wedding banquets, birthday banquets, and soup noodle banquets to donate, and some have even donated the funds from dinner parties. Some Westerners have also been moved by sympathy and have generously donated, and have also raised donations from relatives and friends. Manufacturers and businesses have generously donated food, medicine, daily necessities, etc. Enthusiastic about doing good, they have sought each other out. From January 1st to April 30th, a total of 90,818.01 yuan in national currency and 12,163.80 yuan worth of goods have been received.</p>
<p>Use of Donations</p>
<p>From January 1st to April 30th, the hall's expenditures were: water and electricity bills (arrears from the 29th year of the Republic) 18,914 yuan, water and electricity bills 3,834 yuan, rice 37,500 yuan, vegetables, oil, salt, etc. 9,572 yuan, coal 2,306 yuan, clothing 5,210 yuan, medicine 457 yuan, supplies 8,778 yuan, 39 small iron beds 890 yuan, consumables (soap, grass paper, etc.) 1,618 yuan, kerosene 896 yuan, wages 2,421 yuan, transportation costs 602 yuan, totaling 90,998 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Budget Estimate</p>
<p>The hall currently averages 1,000 residents per day. The annual expenses are 1,200 bags of rice, 180 tons of coal, 54,000 yuan for vegetables, 5,400 catties of soybean oil, 3,600 catties of salt, 1,800 catties of soy sauce, 120 cans of kerosene, 6,000 yuan for soap and grass paper, 12,000 yuan for clothing, 18,000 yuan for medicine, 2,400 yuan for transportation, 8,400 yuan for wages, 12,000 yuan for water fees, and 20,000 yuan for various contingency expenses, totaling 192,000 yuan. Today, the cost of living is high, and everything is expensive. The above budget is the bare minimum and based on current market prices. Future changes are not yet included.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to Continued Donations</p>
<p>The use of previous donations has been detailed above. According to the hall's budget estimate, in addition to the more than 300,000 yuan already donated, there is still a shortfall of more than 90,000 yuan. If the goal can be reached, the hall's expenses for the 30th year of the Republic can be guaranteed, and the clothing and food of nearly a thousand orphans and elderly people can be ensured. We sincerely hope that readers of this newspaper will continue their past enthusiasm. Those who have not donated should donate generously, and those who have donated should donate again. Both funds and goods are welcome. Donation collection points: Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, No. 460 Hankou Road; Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, Sassoon House on the Bund; Jihua Tang Pharmacy, No. 47 Yunnan Road; Huamei Pharmacy, No. 156 Fuzhou Road; Catholic Church, Catholic Church in the French Concession.

<h3>Man and Woman Commit Suicide Together; Spiritual Marriage Held; Joining as Husband and Wife in the Underworld</h3>
<p>Ge Mingshi, from Suzhou, 28 years old, was the manager of the Wanli Printing Factory, set up by his cousin Ge Zhenghai at No. 7 XinKaiHe, which printed the money. He recognized the couple Ji Shishi from Zhenjiang, who lived at number 17 in the neighborhood, as righteous parents, and developed love with Ji's eldest daughter, Shundi, privately pledging their lifelong alliance. Later, Ge lost a large amount of shop money due to gambling, resulting in his cousin stopping his employment. After losing his job, he lived and ate at Ji's house. Because Ji's daughter was already pregnant and near her due date, Ji, having no sons, was willing to marry Shundi to Ge as his wife for support and urged Ge to quickly hire a matchmaker to get married. But Ge was not only unable to marry, but also worried about the problems that would arise in life after marriage. After discussing with Shundi, there was no good solution, so they both had a bad thought and went out together on the 13th. The following night, at the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao, they simultaneously committed suicide by poisoning, but they could not be saved and died. Their bodies were collected and coffined by their families. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. It is now heard that the relatives and friends of both the man and woman, because Ge was unable to get married due to economic difficulties and committed suicide together, and their love was passionate, asked both parents to agree and schedule a spiritual marriage to fulfill the wishes of the deceased, so that they could join as husband and wife in the underworld. Now the two coffins are temporarily placed at  Qian due to transportation reasons and will be taken back to their hometowns by the man's family for burial in the future.</p>

<h3>Two Kidnapping Cases Occurred in the French Concession Last Night; Zhang Yicheng, Prosecutor of the First Special District Court; The Wife and Son of Judge Fang Qinghuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Yicheng, a 65-year-old prosecutor of the First Special District Court from Suzhou, lived in the East Wing on the second floor of No. 4 Kanningli, near the Paris Theatre on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. At around 10:10 PM last night, two men suddenly drove to the place in car number 1121. The car stopped at the entrance to the alley, and the two broke into his room, went straight to Zhang's residence on the second floor, immediately drew their guns, threatened and intimidated him, forcibly dragged Zhang out, forced him into the car, and drove away quickly. The family immediately reported the matter to the French police. When Chinese and Western detectives received the news and arrived, the people and car had already left, and their whereabouts were unknown. The police are currently secretly investigating the case.

At that time, Fang happened to be away from home. It is learned that Ms. Chen previously served as a judge in the Second Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Mother's Day for Nurses</h3>
<p>The Chinese Christian Association, in order to promote the virtue of filial piety, specially initiated and designated yesterday as China's first Parents' Day. Amidst enthusiastic gatherings by various groups to celebrate filial piety, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Nurses Association also held a "Mother's Day" for nurses at the American Church on Avenue Petain, commemorating the nurses' "mother"—Ms. Florence Nightingale of England.</p>
<p>Following a long spell of drizzling rain, the tender green leaves glistened with an extraordinary radiance, and the tranquil Avenue Petain bathed in the warm sunlight. Lush ivy adorned the American Church, and magnificent hymns drifted from the church into the ears of people strolling on the lawn, each person's heart experiencing the cleansing of sacred songs. After two o'clock in the afternoon, white-clad nurses gradually arrived at the large lawn beside the church, their laughter and joy filling the air. From the upper floor of the building next to the church, cheerful sounds of foreigners having lunch could be heard. The beautiful sunlight warmed everyone's face, creating a feeling of early summer. The great magic of the universe and religion made me feel the preciousness of life.</p>
<p>More than five hundred "angels in white" gathered on the lawn and were captured by the camera, before entering the church in an orderly procession. Participants included graduates from major Shanghai hospitals such as the First Red Cross Hospital, Renji Hospital, Red House Women's Hospital, Bethel Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, and the Public Health Nursing Department of the Chinese Health Association, etc. The graduates of each hospital were arranged in the center of the church's upper balcony, student nurses were placed on the left and right balconies, and serving nurses sat in the rows on the church floor. After a majestic march, the entire nursing staff sang the Chinese Nurses Association's anthem. Ms. Wu Zheying, the chairwoman, delivered a speech saying: "Today is the most enthusiastic of our annual nurses' gatherings." This was followed by Pastor Yu's prayer and scripture reading, and then a chorus performance by the Shanghai Women's Medical College choir. Next was a speech by Ms. Tian Cuili, an executive member of the Chinese Nurses Association, who spoke at length, encouraging nurses in the three aspects of virtue, intellect, and physical fitness, hoping that nurses would bravely and loyally take on the responsibility of health, not only in hospitals, but also in any part of society, especially during times of national crisis.</p>
<p>After a solo performance by Mrs. Shen Baochang, Pastor Yu gave another speech. He said that he had only ever addressed doctors once in his life, which was at a medical conference many years ago. He said that usually doctors lecture us, but to have the opportunity to lecture doctors was a great honor. Today was his second time.</p>
<p>"Today is Parents' Day; but today is truly Mother's Day for nurses, so its significance is particularly profound." Pastor Yu said, "Nurses should never forget your 'mother' – Ms. Florence Nightingale, commemorate her birthday, commemorate her service to the nation and her spirit of establishing the nursing profession."</p>
<p>"Florence Nightingale was born on May 12, 1820, and died on August 13, 1910." Pastor Yu continued to report on the history of this "mother" of nurses. "Her body was not very strong, but she was able to enjoy a long life of ninety years, which was the result of her lifelong hard work and service."</p>
<p>"She was born into a wealthy family, but she was rich in the spirit of serving people. Even when she saw a dog about to be put to death by its owner because it was injured, she rescued it and healed the injured dog. This compassion prompted her to nurse patients.</p>
<p>"Because her family was wealthy, she often had the opportunity to travel to various countries and places. Once, she traveled with her family, and suddenly she fell ill herself. With the close care of Catholic priests, her illness was cured. During her illness, she learned nursing methods, which prompted her to decide to promote the nursing profession.</p>
<p>"In 1854, war broke out in Europe. Seeing the pain of the wounded soldiers on the front lines, she resolutely gathered thirty-eight nurses whom she had trained and went to serve on the front lines. After three years of long-term service in the rear of the battlefield, experiencing all kinds of difficulties and hardships, she healed tens of thousands of wounded soldiers. From then on, she received enthusiastic support and welcome from the people of the whole country, and the work of nurses was regarded as the savior of patients, and their status was no less than that of doctors.</p>
<p>"The work of nurses must be respected in order to raise the status of nurses: Ms. Florence Nightingale was able to become the 'mother' of nurses all over the world because she respected her own work. She improved the status of nurses with her hard work and service, as it is today. This is the result of her lifelong struggle. She has the following four requirements for nurses: (1) Continuous and humble learning, (2) Strict observance of discipline and order like soldiers in the army, (3) The spirit of obedience like soldiers to their superiors, (4) Abundant compassion; nurses who do not possess these four qualities cannot be called excellent nurses.</p>
<p>"During the era of 1854, there were two women in England who were most supported by the people of the whole country, one was Queen Elizabeth, and the other was the nurse's 'mother', Florence Nightingale. After Florence Nightingale passed away, she was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, which shows her lofty status and the love and support of the whole country."</p>
<p>This is indeed a most beautiful story for the nurses.</p>
<p>Amidst the majestic hymns, I followed the "angels in white" out of the American Church. At half past four in the afternoon, a beautiful sun shone on the clear road and the surrounding new green branches. (Jiang Ping)</p>

<h3>Teachers Demand Higher Salaries, and Peizhi Still Has Problems</h3>
<p>Peichu To Discuss Terms at Length</p>
<p>The faculty and staff of the Peichu Elementary School and Peizhi Elementary School in this city have requested the school to increase their salaries due to the fact that they cannot maintain their livelihoods. According to a Guanghua News Agency reporter, the Peichu Elementary School will hold a meeting with the faculty and staff at 4:00 p.m. today to discuss the matter at length. Although the Peizhi Elementary School has sent letters to various newspapers stating that the matter has been resolved satisfactorily through the mediation of the school board, according to reliable sources, the school's statement is completely untrue, and the inside situation is unknown to outsiders. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Future of Peizhi Is Difficult to Be Optimistic About</p>
<p>The school principal, Chen Yuqi (whose actual power is controlled by his younger brother, Chen Wei), originally divided the school into two parts: a junior high school and an elementary school. Eight elementary school teachers, including Yang Qizhan and Wu Tiemin, requested the school to improve their treatment under the principle of not neglecting their teaching due to the rising cost of living, and petitioned the relevant parties to deal with the matter impartially. After personnel were dispatched to go there every day for the past three days, they conducted a fair mediation based on the income and expenditure of both parties. Due to the fact that the school's expenses for this semester had already been slightly increased at the beginning of the semester, there was not much left over, so the salary was calculated for five months as usual, and it has now been temporarily increased to six months, and the remaining will be handled according to the means of making money in the next semester. As for the issue of teacher security, the school firmly refused, believing that the principal had the right to weigh it, and that the two teachers, Yang and Wu, should be replaced immediately. Fortunately, the teachers were able to take the overall situation into account and make a peaceful appeal under the condition of not neglecting their teaching and to submit to reasonable mediation. However, due to the school's lack of sincerity, they usually treat teachers like servants and often scold them publicly. After requesting a salary increase, they took the opportunity to conduct an emergency test. The principal and the director of teaching broke into the classroom, causing a major conflict with the teachers, and announced a one-day suspension of classes as a pretext for the replacement. Therefore, according to general observation, the future of the school is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<h3>Vicissitudes of the Ball Field—The Old Nanyang Football Team in the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Old Boy</p>
<p>The other day, this newspaper published about the old Nanyang football team of the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China. Now, tracing back further, I will record the lineup of the old Nanyang football team in the late Qing Dynasty at the end of the article, which is also historical material for the sports world.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunling</p>
<p>Gao Wenbing Tang Ronggeng</p>
<p>Gu Yingbiao</p>
<p>Tang Rongbing Huang Hao</p>
<p>Xi Demao Xi Debing Tang Rongjin Cheng Pengzhu Lu Pinlin</p>
<p>At that time, the most famous in the football world was the right winger Lu Pinlin. At that time, the fashion in the football field was to dribble the ball, and Lu was good at this, and people praised him. Among the eleven people, Zhang, Gao, Cheng, Lu, and the Xi brothers were all people from Jiangsu, and the Tang brothers and Gu and Huang were all from Guangdong. Chunling, Yingbiao, and Rongjin were good at punt pole and the standing triple jump. Rongbing was the strongest, and he was good at shot put. Huang Hao was good at sprinting and sledgehammer (this item is no longer in today's track and field, but at that time there was no discus throw and javelin throw). Demao was good at the 880-yard race. Now only the Xi brothers are famous in the financial world. Mr. Gan has been a railway engineer for a long time, and few people know about him. Huang Hao used to be a jockey, and perhaps some people still know about him. Most of the rest are unknown, and some have passed away, which is truly a vicissitude of the sports world. At that time, the St. John's football team was comparable to Nanyang, and they were repeatedly the leaders. The most famous football players were the Pan brothers, Wenhuan and Wenbing, who were also good at track and field, with the long jump being the best.</p>

<h3>Special Products Unified Sales During Wartime in China</h3>
<p>— He Zhang</p>
<p>China's trade policy, amidst the current war, has overcome all difficulties and grown healthily, advancing towards rationalization day by day. In terms of management scope, it has evolved from localized control; in terms of management techniques, it has progressed from simple to rigorous; and in terms of management institutions, it has moved from duplication to unification. These many facts truly fill us with extraordinary excitement.</p>
<p>In particular, in this wartime trade policy, state-run agencies have achieved the greatest success in the unified sales of certain specific items and in the establishment of barter systems with friendly nations. In fact, unified sales and barter are inseparable, with the idea of unified sales originating from barter. Currently, the special products designated by the government for unified sales are tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals. Except for minerals, which are managed by the National Resources Commission, the remaining three are managed by the Trade Commission. Under the commission are three state-owned companies: Fuxing Company handles tung oil; China Tea Company handles tea; and Fuhua Company handles bristles and sundries. Initially, the government unified the sale of tea, which stemmed from the barter trade with the Soviet Union. Subsequently, U.S. loans were established, with tung oil as collateral for the barter agreement, managed by Fuxing Company. Consequently, other commodities have also tended to be included in barter items.</p>
<p>I. Facilities for Unified Sales of Special Products</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Managing National Tea Export Trade," the Trade Commission drafted the "General Rules for the Organization of Tea Management Agencies in Various Provinces," which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and issued to the six tea-producing provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, instructing them to organize tea management offices in accordance with the aforementioned general rules. In addition, the commission drafted tea loan purchase plans for each province. Since 1938, substantial tea loans were established, with the commission providing 80% and the provincial governments providing 20%. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance ordered the inclusion of tea purchases, domestic sales, and barter matters. In 1940, the Central Trust Bureau of the Ministry of Finance increased its capital and reorganized it into a state-owned specialized company under the jurisdiction of the Trade Commission, which took charge of the unified purchase and sale of tea, thereby further strengthening the tea promotion organization.</p>
<p>The unified sale of tung oil began in 1938. On October 6, 1939, the Trade Commission drafted a proposal for national unified purchase and sale of tung oil, which was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for transmittal to the Executive Yuan for promulgation and implementation. Regarding commissioned purchases, the commission signed a contract with the China Vegetable Oil Factory in December 1938, and then formulated "Provisional Detailed Rules for Adjusting National Tung Oil Trade" in February 1939. Regarding the management of Sichuan tung oil trade, the Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to assist tung oil exports, formulated "Outline of Provisional Measures for Sichuan Tung Oil Trade" with the commission to facilitate the unified purchase and sale work of the Trade Commission. Later, in order to further unify the national purchase and sale of tung oil, the Ministry of Finance promulgated fifteen articles of the "National Tung Oil Unified Purchase and Sale Measures" and seventeen articles of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the National Tung Oil Unified Purchase and Sale Measures" on October 20, 1940. Since the promulgation of these measures, the unified handling of tung oil purchase and sale matters in various parts of the country has been undertaken by the Fuxing Commercial Company.</p>
<p>Bristles are one of the important export commodities. Sichuan produces more than 3,000 dan of white bristles annually, worth about 2 million yuan, which were previously bleached and sold to various countries by foreign merchants and Japanese traders in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the war, Chinese businessmen established the Yu Bleaching Bristle Factory, but its capital was small and its scale was very small. The Trade Commission then purchased it in January 1939, expanded its original equipment, increased its working capital, and sold it to Europe and the United States on its own. Regarding black bristles, in order to promote exports, the commission signed a contract with the Sichuan Livestock Products Trading Company, entrusting it to purchase them on its behalf. The company could pre-pay the purchase price from the commission when purchasing raw materials to facilitate turnover. On March 3, 1940, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Revised National Bristle Unified Sale Measures," stipulating that the purchase and sale of all kinds of bristles nationwide should be uniformly handled by the Trade Commission. The Trade Commission could entrust business firms and warehouses engaged in the bristle business to handle the purchase and management of bristles.</p>
<p>China's mineral resources are very abundant, such as tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, etc., which occupy a very important position in world resources. After the outbreak of the war, the purchase and sale of mineral products was executed by the National Resources Commission designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In order to strictly control mineral products in various places, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Mineral Products Transportation" on December 2, 1939. According to these regulations, the "Implementation Measures for the National Resources Commission to Manage Mineral Products" were formulated and promulgated nationwide in January 1940, designating specialized management agencies and entrusting the competent provincial government agencies to manage everything. These agencies have been established in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei and other provinces. All mineral products are divided into two types: Type A mineral products are tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, , copper, etc.; Type B mineral products are aluminum, nickel, lead, manganese, and other mineral sands, lime, sulfur soil, refractory clay, magnesite, dolomite, acid-base fluorite, alum, gypsum, phosphate rock, arsenic ore and its products. The purchase, transportation and other related matters of Type A mineral products are managed by the tungsten and antimony management divisions, or entrusted to other agencies for execution, and cannot be freely traded. The purchase price is determined and announced by the National Resources Commission at any time. Type B mineral products can be freely traded, but transportation and export must be submitted to the NRC or its entrusted agency for review, the issuance of export permits, and settlement of foreign exchange with the bank before customs declaration can be made. Merchants engaged in mining and refining Type A mineral products should report the actual stock and possible and actual output of the mineral products for registration, so as to allocate production and sales. This method is more unified and stricter than in the past.</p>
<p>II. Overview of Unified Sales Exports</p>
<p>After the government authorities' unified purchase and sale of the above four items, they were able to maintain a good situation in an extremely difficult environment and showed an increasing trend. The following is a brief description of the export situation of these four items:</p>
<p>Chinese tea is sold to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. After the outbreak of the war, China concentrated on trade with the Soviet Union due to its barter trade with the Soviet Union; however, due to transportation inconveniences, it was unable to develop it as much as possible. According to customs records, the total value of various tea exports in 1937 was 29 million yuan. Exports were less in the first half of 1938, but more in the second half, with a total value of more than 33 million yuan. Exports decreased again in the first half of 1939, but increased in the second half, and the total annual value decreased compared with the previous year, to more than 30 million yuan. By 1940, both the export value and quantity had increased, with the value reaching over 104 million yuan; and the quantity increased by more than 100,000 metric tons compared with the previous year. Most of the exports of various Chinese teas were exported through Hong Kong. The Chinese tea market was originally dominated by the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, and the Soviet Union. Since the outbreak of the European War, the sales market has undergone great changes. The United Kingdom used an import quota system to control the import of foreign tea, which had a great impact on the Chinese tea market. In the North African market, only Morocco still has a large sales volume recently. The United States has also recently increased. As for the Soviet Union market, there are no recent figures to be found in the customs records; however, according to reports in Chongqing in January this year, it was completed at the end of last year, and its contents are divided into three parts. The first two parts are the exchange of Chinese wool and tea worth 100 million yuan for Soviet aid, which has already been signed and announced. Judging from this huge value, it can be seen that most of China's tea is sold to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The tung oil market is the largest in the United States, and other countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries also have considerable imports. Since the outbreak of the war, the impact on tung oil exports can be said to have been very significant. For example, tung oil exports in 1935 were more than 730,000 metric tons, worth more than 41 million yuan; in 1936, they reached more than 860,000 metric tons, worth more than 73 million yuan. In the first half of 1937, tung oil exports were quite impressive, reaching more than 10 million yuan in June, more than 15 million yuan in July, and after August, they were affected by the war and fell to only 5 or 6 million yuan per month; however, the total quantity and total value for the whole year were still very large, with the quantity reaching more than 1 million metric tons and the value reaching 89.8451 million yuan. By 1938, although the Yuehan Railway was still passable before September of that year, tung oil was usually transported in bulk cargo ships, but now it was transported by railway, which was very inconvenient. Therefore, the total quantity of tung oil exports in 1938 decreased to more than 695,700 metric tons, with a value of only more than 39 million yuan. In 1939, tung oil was completely exported through Kunming and Longzhou, with difficult transportation and higher freight costs, which greatly increased prices in foreign markets. Therefore, although the export quantity decreased greatly in that year; the value was similar to that of the previous year. The more than 33 million yuan in 1939 increased by more than 20 million yuan; however, in terms of quantity, it has decreased due to transportation difficulties. After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "National Tung Oil Unified Purchase and Sale Measures" in October 1940, tung oil exports should increase. According to a telecommunications report on March 22 of this year, foreign trade experts observed that the domestically produced tung oil this year will definitely sell well. Its main target is the United States, because: 1. The United States is mass-producing military supplies, and tung oil is one of the main raw materials; 2. The United States’ tung oil production is limited by climate, soil, and labor, and has reached a saturation point. Therefore, tung oil exports should increase in the future.</p>
<p>Bristles have always been an export commodity with a high reputation in China. Recently, due to the government's promotion and control, exports have increased even more. From January to April 1937, they were all around 1 million yuan, more than 2 million yuan in May, more than 3 million yuan in June, more than 4 million yuan in July, and although they dropped to more than 1 million yuan in August; but after September, they were more than 3 million yuan again. It can be seen that this export has not been greatly affected by the war. The situation in 1938 was also impressive, with a total value of 28 million yuan for the whole year. After 1939, due to the government authorities' determination to rectify and do their best to increase exports, the total value for the whole year increased to more than 41 million yuan. The situation in 1940 was even better, with the total value for the whole year reaching more than 94 million yuan, ranking first in exports for that year.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, thanks to the efforts of the government authorities, the export volume of various important commodities has greatly increased. Among them, minerals are the object of the government authorities' promotion of exports. The object is to maintain the position of the international market on the one hand and to maintain the vitality of the national economy and finance on the other hand. Therefore, the export of mineral products is especially worthy of attention during the war. Mineral exports have totaled more than 100 million yuan in recent years, among which tin, tungsten, and antimony are the most important. These had already become major export commodities before the war, and the export volume during the war is still considerable every year. In 1936, tin ingots and the like were worth more than 26 million yuan. After the outbreak of the war, exports in 1937 were nearly 40 million yuan. In the last three years, they have also been around 35-36 million yuan, mostly exported from Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. The export volume of tungsten ore was very small before the war. In 1935 and 1936, they were only worth about 8-9 million yuan. It was not until 1937 that the export of tungsten ore was worth 40 million yuan, 50 million yuan in 1938, and 45 million yuan in 1939. However, it decreased in 1940, with only 10 million yuan, which may be due to loan repayment relations, and export figures cannot be fully recorded. As for the export of antimony ore, it was a very important export commodity in the last European War; in this great war, it should have even greater importance. However, the export volume in recent years has only been worth 5-6 million yuan, which is only the small number shown in the customs records, and not all of it. After the government unified the sale of this military raw material, the actual export value must be very considerable.</p>
<p>III. Conclusion</p>
<p>The above four special products have achieved such achievements in a difficult environment, which shows the effectiveness of government control. In the first quarter of this year, the export of these four special products generally showed an improved phenomenon. The following is the export value for the first quarter of this year: Tung oil: 81,995 metric tons, 23,864,577 yuan; 50,210 metric tons, 7,538,724 yuan in the same quarter of last year. Tea: 23,135 metric tons, 6,372,555 yuan; 164,270 metric tons, 43,569,392 yuan in the same quarter of last year. Bristles: 755,931 kg, 26,909,147 yuan; 731,470 kg, 8,770,202 yuan in the same quarter of last year. Mineral products including mineral sand, metals and metal products: 102,408,437 yuan; 16,522,727 yuan in the same quarter of the year. As mentioned above, the goods sold by the government have barter or debt repayment relations, and the figures are not the whole picture; however, judging from the export figures of the goods sold by the government in the first quarter of this year, we can also get a glimpse of the increase.</p>
<p>In short, under the government's encouragement of production and unified purchase and sale of these special products, exports can naturally be increased in the future. If Chinese people can fully cooperate with the government, they can achieve greater effectiveness in control. What needs to be explained here is that wartime export trade contains a new meaning. The foreign exchange of this trade is an important source. With foreign exchange, we can consolidate finance and import production tools from abroad. In other words, wartime export trade is an important source of national defense power. Therefore, the people's real cooperation with the government is an inescapable duty.</p>

<p>The translation of place names in the article "Wang Yi's Translation of the Strategic Meaning of Customs Trade" is inconsistent. Corrected translations based on letters and telegrams from Mr. Wu Chengxi, Mr. Fei Zengmin, and Mr. Zhu Zhi'an are as follows: Baltic States: Baltic States; Danube States: Danube States; Caribbean States: Caribbean States</p>
<h3>Issues in the Use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund</h3>
<p>— YQ</p>
<p>Sino-American monetary negotiations began last autumn and immediately decided on the principle of a Sino-American monetary alliance; however, the agreement has not been signed, presumably due to technical issues.</p>
<p>Now, the agreement was signed at the end of last month, and the United States has provided 50 million US dollars as one of the legal tender exchange stabilization funds: at the same time, the United Kingdom has also expanded the fund to 10 million pounds. Together with the amount provided by our national bank, the legal tender exchange fund is at least over 110 million US dollars. The Chinese, British, and American authorities are currently selecting personnel to form a joint management committee for the exchange stabilization fund. Needless to say, the piling problem that was previously unresolved has now been completely resolved.</p>
<p>But how was it resolved? That is, how to stabilize the exchange market between China, Britain, and the United States? It is not something that outsiders can know, but it is also the issue that outsiders most want to know.</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange black market in this city these past few days, Chinese and foreign banks, especially Japanese banks, have been throwing foreign exchange to HSBC. I think: in addition to escaping future losses, it may not be without the intention of testing HSBC's attitude towards the future exchange stabilization policy.</p>
<p>What decisions have the three countries made regarding the future stabilization policy? We naturally cannot know. But what can be said with certainty is that the foundation of the legal tender will be strengthened from now on, and the position of the legal tender in the international foreign exchange market will inevitably be improved from now on; US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau expressed full optimism about this when reporting the Sino-American monetary alliance to Congress the day before yesterday; authoritative figures in London have also frequently issued optimistic views on the future of the legal tender. Moreover, the black exchange rate in this city has been lengthening step by step; the price of gold is plummeting miserably, etc.; all of which reflect the general good psychology of speculators. Because of this, throwing foreign exchange now is to escape losses, and taking it in becomes accepting losses. However, in order to avoid falling into the hands of others, HSBC has to appropriately take it in. As a result, HSBC's listing has to be carried out in steps: the activities on HSBC's small counters have to become a situation where some are relaxed and some are not accepted; and the softening outside the bank is an opportunity for HSBC to pull back legal tender and pass on losses, just like the softening that occurred once last weekend and then rebounded.</p>
<p>The so-called use of the exchange stabilization fund, in addition to stabilizing at what level, has a special topic in Shanghai: that is, how to prevent it from falling into the hands of others? In the past, people were used to linking "maintaining" and "not maintaining" with this issue; now it is no longer valid. After the signing of the Sino-American Central Monetary Agreement, the four banks decisively resumed business, which shows that "maintaining" is actually an established and unchangeable fixed policy. And the removal of this threat seems to be a more important key. These are the two plans of the United States to expand the embargo and freeze the Axis countries' deposits in the United States. With the extremely tense relations between Japan and the United States now, the need for the Japanese side to steal American foreign exchange has been reduced to a minimum, and it will only get worse from now on. Once the freeze is implemented, there will be no problem. Because of this, the future Sino-British and Sino-American exchange stabilization policies are very clear. In a word, the use of the exchange stabilization fund will be linked to the price policy of free China from now on? It is no longer simply limited to the adjustment of the international balance of payments as in the past. Although the goal is not Shanghai, Shanghai will be the first to obtain its good influence.</p>
<h3>Seeing, Hearing, Thinking</h3>
<p>When US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau reported to Congress on the establishment of the Sino-British-American Exchange Stabilization Fund, he also formally requested Congress to authorize the President to reduce the gold content of the US dollar. These two things are talked about together for the first time.</p>
<p>The commercial exchange rates listed by China and Communications Banks are 4.5 pence for British foreign exchange, 7.5 yuan for US foreign exchange, and 2.23 yuan for Hong Kong foreign exchange. In the past, they never had any effect on the Shanghai black market. In the future, they may be decorated into a butcher knife to wipe out speculators.</p>
<p>The great move of the two concession authorities to transport rice to Shanghai has flattened the heads of the rice smugglers. Countless lives have been saved. It is hoped that the market will be further cleaned up internally, the remaining warlords will be eliminated, and future troubles will be avoided.</p>
<p>It is estimated that speculators sacrificed about 30 million yuan in the rice market, about 100 million yuan in the gold market, about 100 million yuan in the yarn market, and a total of about 300 million yuan in foreign stocks and securities, etc., in the current market improvement. However, it has not yet reached the end!</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: India Silver Plummets Five Annas</h3>
<p>Bombay, 10th (Telegraph) - The Bombay silver market suddenly plummeted by five annas. Spot prices were sluggish, with a total of 100 transactions. There was no market for American and British silver, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Cotton Markets are Rising</h3>
<p>New York cotton market: Initially rose due to purchases by Wall Street stock traders, then fell back due to profit-taking by bulls. The closing result was still up 4 to 13 pounds per ton compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Bombay cotton market: Initially rose due to purchases by speculators, then fell back due to cotton merchants hedging, and finally rose again due to short covering. The closing result was up 2.34 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the opening forecast for today is that prices will rise by 0.75.</p>
<p>Also, a telegram reports that the Indian cotton statistics from September 1, last year, to May 10, this year, are recorded on the left (per bale of 400 pounds):</p>
<p>Total listings in Bombay: 2,420,000</p>
<p>Remaining inventory: 1,458,000</p>
<p>Listings in Karachi: 1,218,000</p>
<p>Total exports: 987,000</p>
<p>Remaining inventory: 365,000</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Abalone and Scallops Both Rise</h3>
<p>Dried Abalone: Arrivals of high-quality abalone are scarce. If there is no more East-end abalone, supply will be cut off. Therefore, the side-end abalone is rising in price. Yesterday, the market opened at 784 yuan, and the market situation is very strong.</p>
<p>Scallops: Arrivals and inventory are also scarce, and the market situation is very strong. Yesterday, the market opened at 735 yuan for large scallops, 727 yuan for medium scallops, and 711 yuan for small scallops. Sales are very brisk.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Top-Grade Red Dates Rise</h3>
<p>Tianjin Red Dates: There have been few continued arrivals recently, and the market is not very thick. Therefore, the trend is upwards. Yesterday, the market price for first-grade red dates was 65 yuan, second-grade 55 yuan, and Cangzhou red dates 55 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to mid-month. However, miscellaneous grades are cheaper, with neighboring county government red dates at 49 yuan and long red dates at 26-27 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Silk-Like Feather Yarn is Selling Best</h3>
<p>Feather yarn is divided into Western goods and local factory goods, and into twill and plain-woven. Twill is needed in the cold winter and sells widely, while plain-woven is in demand in the hot summer. The trend of local factory feather yarn has recently been better than that of imported goods, because silk-like feather yarn is cheap and beautiful, and very much in line with customers' tastes. Not only do 80-90% of Western-style suits and clothing choose to use it, but it has also become popular as a lining material for Chinese-style clothing recently, so sales are even more robust. It is found that the best-selling item recently is silk-like feather yarn, followed by local factory plain-woven. In terms of prices, yesterday, imported double-width twill feather yarn was priced at 18 yuan per yard, first-grade plain-woven 17 yuan, and second-grade 16 yuan. Local factory plain-woven feather yarn, single-width first-grade was sold at 3 yuan 2.5 jiao, second-grade 1.89 yuan, and third-grade 1.45-1.5 yuan. Silk-like twill feather yarn, special grade 3 yuan, first-grade 2.5-2.6 jiao, second-grade 2.2-2.3 jiao, and third-grade 1.85-2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Saxe-Coburg Top is Steady</h3>
<p>Saxe-Coburg Top has been popular in Shanghai for five years since its arrival, and it is still popular. However, looking back at past actual sales, there is a big difference, because high-end goods are expensive and purchasing power is weakened. Lower-end goods are not sturdy and not durable, and customers mostly abandon them. On the supply side, there are shortages of goods from the East and West, and local factories produce little, so supply and demand are equal. The trend is unstable, and prices have not increased as much as other woolen fabrics. Yesterday, American-made first-grade Saxe-Coburg Top was priced at over 40 yuan per yard, and ordinary grades at around 30 yuan. Japanese goods, first-grade 9.5 yuan, second-grade 7.5 yuan. Local factory wide-width first-grade sells for 12 yuan, and second-grade 10.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Tortoise Shells Open Higher</h3>
<p>Tortoise Shells: There have been few continued arrivals recently. Some customers once brought dozens of packages from the Yangtze River and held onto them until recently, when they began to sell them. Although there was an increase of more than ten yuan compared to the initial arrival price, the difference was limited after adding warehouse rent and interest expenses. Market prices have slightly increased, but sales have not been strong, and there is no hope of excessive increases for the time being.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Deformed Steel Bars are Stagnant and the Market is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Deformed Steel: Deformed steel bars are a necessity for the construction industry, but recently, the construction industry has not been very enthusiastic about purchasing them. Therefore, the opening price is not as firm as before. Currently, 3-4 minute specifications are priced at 3,300 yuan per ton, and 5-minute to 1-inch goods are priced at 3,250 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rubber by Gao Jiannong</h3>
<p>Rubber is the white sap from the rubber tree—or simply the rubber tree—that has coagulated. There are many types of rubber trees, distributed across the three continents of Asia, the Americas, and Africa. Previously, Brazil produced the most, but now the South Seas Islands, especially the Malay Peninsula, are the leaders in production.</p>
<p>The White man’s knowledge of rubber can be traced back to the first half of the sixteenth century, when the Spanish had just conquered Mexico. Some priests saw the natives using the sap from a type of rubber tree called Castilloa to make leather balls or armor, but this did not cause much of a stir. Two centuries later, in 1736, near the equator at La Conasnrine, and upstream on the Orinoco River, someone saw Indians using “elastic pear-shaped vessels.” He wrote a report, attaching samples, and sent it to the French National Academy of Sciences. However, this paper was not published by the Academy until fifteen years later. In 1768, the properties of rubber were again studied in the area by engineer Fresneau, who submitted a report to the Academy of Sciences, but the Academy did not even print it. Nevertheless, the wonderful use of rubber by the Indians for erasing pencil marks gradually became known, and White men timidly used rubber to make some unimportant small tools. In short, the greatest use of rubber at that time was still just cutting up the rubber balls made by the Indians to make "small erasers" to erase pencil marks. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Spiritual Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>This publication has always had remarkable discussions on clothing, food, housing, and transportation, benefiting readers greatly. However, it has only discussed some material aspects of these things, and seems to have little research on the spiritual aspects. Therefore, today I want to make an exception and talk about some things so that we can have good clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the spiritual sense.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I will now discuss it in four points:</p>
<p>Clothing - Every day we get up and must change into clean clothes to wear, so that others and ourselves will not feel the smell of sweat, and we must also make our clothes give people a sense of beauty. But in the spiritual sense, we must also have a delicate and beautiful garment to wear on our body, so that others will envy and respect us. But what kind of garment is that? I can simply say that it is "the garment of morality". People with high morals and good character are wearing clean "moral clothing", and they are actually more beautiful than those who wear flashy clothes in form.</p>
<p>Food - We eat every day to grow and live. But in the spiritual sense, we must also have a kind of spiritual food to expand our knowledge and enrich our experience. The so-called "spiritual food" refers to good books and real-life experiences, which can make our learning profound and strengthen our spiritual bodies. Therefore, a person who eats fat in form, if he has not received an education, then his body is still weak and unhealthy.</p>
<p>Housing - If a person lives in a magnificent and comfortable house, in material terms, he is indeed very comfortable. But if this person is very lonely, then I think he must still be in great pain spiritually. Therefore, I believe that in the spiritual sense, "living" should be "living" among the masses, which means that we should think of the masses in everything we do, not be selfish, but regard ourselves as one of the vast masses, and be comfortable for the comfort of the masses, and be in pain for the pain of the masses. Therefore, although a person lives in a small and dark cubicle in material terms, if he can place his spirit in the masses, then he is like living in a magnificent and beautiful house.</p>
<p>Transportation - When we walk, we always choose clean and wide streets to walk on, and do not like dark and dirty narrow alleys. I think that in the journey of life, we should also choose the broad road, and should not go into a fork in the road, so that we have the danger of falling into a trap. Therefore, those who walk on the path of light, their future is also bright.</p>
<h3>Hats and Socks</h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>Hats should be light and soft and without strong pressure, because the skin of the head is the same as the skin of other parts of the body, and it also needs to emit water vapor and carbon dioxide, so whether or not there is ventilation in the hat, the water vapor, etc. in the head will fill the hat and increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the hat, which will cause headaches. According to experts, headaches will occur as long as the amount of carbon dioxide in the air in the hat is more than 0.3% higher than the outside world. Therefore, it is necessary to use materials with good ventilation to make hats, such as felt hats and woolen hats made of materials without ventilation, and sufficient ventilation holes must be prepared to make the air in the hat easy to circulate.</p>
<p>Hair is a natural protection for the head, so there is originally no need to wear a hat, but many people like to wear hats, and almost treat them as decorations, but when wearing a hat, the above conditions cannot be ignored. When going out in winter, just wear a hat that can maintain the temperature of the head, otherwise the head will be in danger of congestion. When going out in summer, you can wear a straw hat with sufficient ventilation holes to block the sunlight. If you carry a parasol, then you don’t need to wear a hat.</p>
<p>There are many types of shoes, but leather shoes are the most common. Although leather shoes can prevent moisture, the air in leather shoes is scarce, the specific gravity is large, and the moisture transfer is strong. Therefore, it is not suitable to wear leather shoes in winter. Moreover, leather shoes have no ventilation. The water vapor and carbon dioxide emitted from the skin are all stagnant inside, especially when walking, the emission of these excretions is more vigorous, resulting in sweating feet and moist feet, resulting in the so-called "dampness" disease, so leather shoes are not very hygienic. Shoes made of serge or cloth have fewer disadvantages, but leather shoes can overwhelm everything in terms of not leaking water and being durable. In short, it is best to choose a material that is waterproof and has ventilation to make shoes.</p>
<p>The first thing to pay attention to in shoes is whether they fit the size of the feet. Shoes that are too small can easily cause skin damage or bone deformation, and there is a risk of nail disease. Also, high heels can cause the toes to bend at the bottom and cause foot bone deformation, and it is also very easy to operate the waist, so it is best not to wear them.</p>
<p>Socks are also worth paying attention to. In summer, thin socks are suitable. If you wear shoes with great warmth retention in winter, such as leather shoes, it is better to wear thick socks that are lighter and contain a large amount of air, because it has the effect of preventing temperature loss and reducing sweat secretion and circulating air. Therefore, it is suitable to wear wool socks in winter. Because socks are more easily soiled than other parts, and absorb more moisture, and emit more excretions, emitting an indescribable stench, so they must be changed and washed frequently, and it is most appropriate to change them every day. Moreover, it is better to wash lightly when slightly dirty than to wash strongly when very dirty. Although the number of washes is more, the chance of damage is reduced.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Potato</h3>
<p>— Overtones</p>
<p>About two hundred years ago, potatoes were still an unfamiliar name in Europe. Once, a wealthy merchant suddenly received a strange gift from his friend—a small bag of potatoes, so he asked his gardener to plant them in the best soil, and was already prepared to taste their deliciousness. In the autumn, the merchant specially invited his friends to dinner, so he told the cook to make a bowl of potatoes well. However, the cook had never cooked this strange thing, so he flavored the tender stems, leaves, and small green fruits with sugar and spices, and then sent them to the banquet. After tasting it, the guests felt that it was tasteless. So this novel food was taken back to the kitchen and eaten by the servants. After a few hours, this group of people fell ill. The doctor said: "This vegetable contains a considerable amount of toxins, but it doesn't matter, it will be fine after a few days." So the potatoes were thrown in the corner of the garden. A few days later, the gardener ordered his son to burn the dried potatoes. The child was very happy to do it. After he burned the dried stems and leaves, he found lumps of things on the roots of the potatoes in the ashes. After peeling off a thin layer of skin, he could see white and powdery flesh. The smell seemed very fragrant? The taste was very good! So he went to tell his father, and his father also felt it was very delicious. At this point, the gardener and the cook realized their mistake. As a result, the master re-asked his friend for some potatoes. From this time on, potatoes became a daily vegetable in European families.</p>
<h3>Escalator</h3>
<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>When I was young, I was used to walking on the wide and large escalators at home. Occasionally, when I went to my neighbors' houses, I saw their high bungalows with a shelf on top. When people wanted to go up to sleep, they had to climb up from a bamboo ladder. I thought this was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Later, when I first went from my hometown to the city, I saw the escalators in the city, which were as small as the bamboo ladders in our hometown. It seemed that they wanted to save the position of the escalator.</p>
<p>When I came to the metropolis from the city, it made me even more surprised. The escalators in the metropolis were narrower, steeper, and there were many of them, extremely dark, and dust accumulated.</p>
<p>Therefore, I often think that Chinese people are unwilling to think about small things; although a small escalator, it is not only convenient for walking; dust accumulation, unbearable darkness, hinders hygiene, and once a fire occurs, it is related to the safety of life in the whole house.</p>
<p>I often observe that developed countries in Europe and the United States attach great importance to the escalators in houses. They not only build them firmly, but also place them in a considerable position, or near a window, to make them bright and ensure safety.</p>

<h3>One Week's Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>For some reason these days, even vegetables have become expensive. Two or three dimes for a pound of vegetables is a very common thing. As for the newly listed seasonal vegetables, needless to say. Amaranth has been on the market for more than ten days, but I have not yet included it in the menu, just because the price is too expensive. The beauty of amaranth lies in its softness and glutinousness. You can't do without it for any kind of fish soup, especially yellow croaker soup. It is extra delicious when you add amaranth. In addition, it is not bad to make soup with shredded pork or sliced pork. As for making vegetarian dishes, you can only stir-fry them. Red amaranth is not yet on the market, and the vegetable is also soft and glutinous, but the soup is red, and some people dare not eat it, which is laughable.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried bamboo shoots with shredded pork, scrambled eggs with chives, stir-fried green vegetables with vermicelli, diced bamboo shoots stir-fried with broad beans</p>
<p>Tuesday: Celery shredded beef, steamed pomfret, vegetable stewed tofu, bamboo shoots mixed with mushroom floss</p>
<p>Wednesday: Preserved mustard tuber shredded pork soup, pan-fried salted fish, stir-fried golden needle vegetable, broad bean tofu flower</p>
<p>Thursday: Curry sliced beef, braised prawns with tofu, braised radish slices, dried shrimp seaweed soup</p>
<p>Friday: Bean curd sheets stir-fried with shredded pork, sweet and sour fried ribbonfish, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts, sesame paste mixed with water celery</p>
<p>Saturday: Daylily stir-fried with shredded chicken, amaranth yellow croaker daylily, vegetarian quilt, sweet and sour shredded radish</p>
<p>Sunday: Duck offal soup, braised cuttlefish, stir-fried broad beans, mixed wormwood</p>
<h3>From Kunming to Lashio</h3>
<p>— Observer</p>
<p>A friend's letter:</p>
<p>There is no food to be had along the way in this section of the journey. Because my colleagues did not know this beforehand, they brought too little dry food. We had to try our best to reduce food and drink for one day and two nights to avoid hunger and thirst. Even if we had thousands of gold coins, we could not buy anything. Gold is useless here. This experience cannot be missed. At 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, we arrived at a bridge. The driver of the front car suddenly pointed to the sky. Everyone understood what was going on, so we stopped the car and sat on the rocks to watch quietly. Before long, earth and stones flew. At this time, everyone only cared about the safety of the bridge, and put their own lives out of their minds; sincerely because the iron cable flying bridge over the empty place is the only one left, how can we not be worried? After a few minutes, the sound stopped, so we accompanied the driver down the mountain and detoured to the bridge. Seeing that the bridge was still intact, we couldn't help cheering. Otherwise, there would be at least a week's delay. We also went to the place where the beacon was set up to check, and picked up two pieces of shrapnel to keep as souvenirs. Who knew that they were later stolen by someone? This thief can be said to have a purpose in stealing this thing.</p>
<p>The highway was destroyed! But it was repaired before dark. Vehicles drove through one after another. At 11:00 p.m., we arrived at Lameng (781.7 kilometers). Without food or accommodation, we slept in the car again for a night. On the 22nd, we stayed in Zhishi (873 kilometers), which is under the jurisdiction of the Tusi. Seven or eight out of ten residents are Han Baiyi people, and only two or three out of ten are Chinese. This place is most prone to miasma and epidemics every rainy season. Except for those who are truly poor, everyone avoids going to other places, and no one dares to stay. The Bank of China has a branch here. That day happened to be the market day—one market every five days! So the market was quite lively. I was guided by my friends to visit various places. Only then did I know that this place is in a pile of chaotic mountains, with crisscrossing ditches. Mosquitoes breed after rain, spreading malignant malaria. The residents do not pay attention to hygiene, and pigs and cattle are everywhere, leaving excrement everywhere. In this early spring season, I already felt a turbid stench. When the weather gets warmer and the sun shines on it, the smell is even more unbearable to imagine, and it is really the source of epidemics. If this situation can be improved, it will not be difficult to turn the miasma village into a paradise. The market is a mix of Chinese and barbarians. The barbarians on the mountain wear iron chains around their waists, or bamboo strips around them, their mouths are like basins of blood, their upper bodies are half naked, and they hear very barbaric things. There is another kind of raw barbarian. They do not go down the mountain often, and take killing foreigners as bravery. On the 23rd, we stayed in Wanting—959.4 kilometers—This place is newly developed, so the market is not as good as Zhishi. At the border between China and Myanmar, there are five or six white crosses of five feet square to demarcate the boundary. Wanting is also under the jurisdiction of the Tusi; there are very few Chinese, only travelers passing through. After passing this, you leave the country and enter Myanmar. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 24th, we arrived safely in Lashio. The eleven-day journey came to an end.</p>
<p>The trucks traveled on the mountains, bumping violently, making people laugh and cry. Accidents of overturned vehicles often occurred along the way. In the abyss of ten thousand feet, even if the body is not crushed, there is no life left. This trip was also full of dangers. Once, a mountain stone collapsed, and the car happened to be at a bend. It was too late to brake; fortunately, the driver was clever and opened the throttle to rush over. Less than a minute after the car passed, we heard a loud noise, with the potential to shatter the earth. Once again, it was also at a bend, and we almost collided with an oncoming car; the driver was stubborn and stubbornly honked the horn to greet the oncoming car, but they were all very brave.</p>
<p>The ground in Lashio is quite small, and it is completely newly developed virgin land. The sound of "chopping wood" can be heard endlessly in the streets. The houses are all made of wooden boards and topped with iron sheets. Occasionally, there are very few buildings built with cement, but the roofs are still made of iron sheets. Teak is to Lashio what pine board is to the mainland of our country. The most residents are Burmese, followed by Indians. In addition to overseas Chinese, most Chinese in Lashio are engaged in transportation. There are very few electric lights. Due to coal source problems, most use gasoline lamps. The cost of living is very high; there are no scenic spots or scenery, and no high-end cinemas. There is only one cinema opened by Indians, showing films taken by Indians, and occasionally old British films. Fortunately, Chongqing newspapers are delivered very quickly, and you can see them in three or four days. In addition, there are Yangon newspapers to read. The climate is very warm at noon, and the difference between morning and evening is very large. Many Chinese who come here suffer from malaria. Airmail letters take about 20 days to arrive. (End)</p>

<h3>Cityscape</h3>
<p>— Li Hongli</p>
<p>A corner of the city</p>
<p>For the sake of the "meal package" on Weng Da's road, Xiao Qizi was discussing it with Xiao Maizi, A Wu, and Gu Gu. When the time for fast seating came, the rice-carrying burden appeared in the distance. Weng Da, who was half-starved, rushed up first. Xiao Qizi and the others had already guarded against him, and chased him up in three steps and two steps. A Wu hugged Weng Da tightly. The two of them quickly emptied the remaining rice and vegetables and ran away in a puff of smoke!</p>
<p>"Chasing is like a blind man with a lantern!" He picked up the remaining rice grains on the ground and ate them before preparing to leave.</p>
<p>"Get out! Want to run, pick it up and go!" The man carrying the burden roared.</p>
<p>"Why? I didn't eat anything."</p>
<p>"Damn you, you guys want to cross the threshold? You eat free food without working. Are you going to carry it or not?"</p>
<p>Weng Da felt two twinges of pain on his head. He picked up the burden and left.</p>
<p>The more Weng Da carried, the heavier it became, and the slower he walked. He asked the old quartermaster to let him rest several times, but he was not allowed. When he felt light all over, his feet could only drag him along!</p>
<p>He suddenly seemed to have discovered something. He didn't know where a burst of courage came from. He rushed forward and grabbed a pedestrian's bread and ran desperately, ran…</p>
<p>He could no longer hear the shouts behind him. He stopped, and his chest felt hot. With a "click," he spat bright red blood on the ground. He sat down against the corner of the wall, wishing he could swallow the whole bread in one bite.</p>
<p>Laijiao A Si didn't know when he came out. Weng Da was so frightened that he trembled, just wanting to hide the half-eaten bread.</p>
<p>"Weng Da! Let's share it!"</p>
<p>"It's not that easy. This was exchanged for my life!"</p>
<p>"Are you giving it or not?" He was a little angry.</p>
<p>"I'm not giving it!" He also hummed.</p>
<p>Laijiao A Si was the first to strike. The two fought for a while.</p>
<p>When Weng Da woke up, the bread was long gone! There was some blood and pus on the ground, left by Laijiao A Si!</p>
<p>He slowly stood up, wanting to beat Laijiao A Si and Xiao Qizi and the others to settle the score.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, a group of "colleagues" were all standing on the side of the road. From their mouths, he learned that a rice truck was coming back!</p>
<p>A few people were discussing: who was willing to hang on the car to cut open the rice bag so that everyone could share it? Weng Da agreed!</p>
<p>The street lights were already on! The car really came. He hung on the car, took out a knife and cut the sack. The whip on top mercilessly hit his head, hands, and body. He didn't let go, still cutting. The rice rustled out, and they all caught it!</p>
<p>Finally, he lost his grip and fell, but those "colleagues" were nowhere to be seen!</p>
<p>It was completely dark! Weng Da, whose body was full of scars, stepped into the small alley. A burst of groans shook his eardrums. Under the dim light, he recognized the person lying on the ground.</p>
<p>"Ma Pi!…"</p>
<p>"Water…"</p>
<p>Large beads of sweat fell from Ma Pi's forehead.</p>
<p>"Water… water…"</p>
<p>Weng Da asked for a bowl of water near his home and walked here:</p>
<p>"The water's here!…"</p>
<p>"…………"</p>
<p>Ma Pi's head was raised by his hand, and his eyes stared straight at him.</p>
<p>"Uh!… a foul odor went straight into his nostrils. The blisters on Ma Pi's feet had already burst! White water was flowing out.</p>
<p>"It's over!…"</p>
<p>He thought for a while, rummaging in Ma Pi's clothes for a long time with both hands, but he only got a small packet of "white powder" that could still be sold for two dimes!</p>
<p>He thought again for a while.</p>
<p>By the time he left here, Ma Pi's body was already naked!</p>
<h3>Wedding Ceremony — A Sketch from the Hall of Joy</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>"Mr. Yan, Mr. So-and-so has arrived!" Little Wang, who was at the door distributing tips for the rickshaw pullers, hopped in excitedly. General Manager Yan, engrossed in arranging the hall, barely registered Little Wang's words. Impatient and agitated, Little Wang dragged him away. Just as General Manager Yan was about to ask what was happening, someone carrying a "Welcome" sign shouted "Guest has arrived!" and bumped right into him. He was quick-witted; wasn't the person behind him the Mr. So-and-so he had invited to officiate the wedding?</p>
<p>"Haha, Mr. So-and-so, thank you for your trouble, truly thank you for your trouble."</p>
<p>"Haha, ha... ha," Mr. So-and-so echoed, seemingly filled with joy as well, his eyes sweeping around. He offered congratulations, exchanged bows, and was offered tea. Mr. So-and-so sat down on a chair, his eyes sweeping around again.</p>
<p>"Mr. So-and-so, thank you for gracing us with your presence; we are truly honored, haha..." the host said obsequiously, bowing low.</p>
<p>"Haha, it's nothing, I'm honored to be considered... And Mr. Yan is an old friend, haha."</p>
<p>"Mr. So-and-so is truly a man of his word," General Manager Yan said, as if having received a compliment. "Is it, perhaps, a bit early? We just finished lunch."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe about right. It's past 2:30." Mr. So-and-so stood up, and everyone else in the room stood up with him. "It's better to start earlier anyway, gives us more leeway..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, and the performance can be extended a bit," someone inside said.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. So-and-so's insight is excellent," said another.</p>
<p>Thus, the manager, the host, the ushers, and others bustled about, tidying up the hall with great energy. Gradually, it took on a more solemn air. Mr. So-and-so also assisted frequently, making sure the marriage certificate, inkpad, order of ceremony, etc., were all properly distributed.</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so dabbed his forehead with a silk handkerchief and leisurely strolled to the front of the stage. The ceremony proceeded at his urging, an hour earlier than originally scheduled.</p>
<p>"Haha, marriage, marriage, is meant to be 'hurried, hurried,' haha, haha," Mr. So-and-so said with a wide grin, as if defending himself.</p>
<p>"Haha,"... The wedding march played at a fast tempo, the bride and groom were nervous, the guests were joyful, and Mr. So-and-so was even more anxious.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yan, I'm off." Mr. So-and-so had just put his badge into his pocket. Without waiting for a "goodbye," he stepped "backwards" and greeted the manager, straightening his collar.</p>
<p>"Mr. So-and-so, stay and have a drink!" The host, noticing the officiant suddenly backing away, personally hurried over.</p>
<p>"Ah, no need to be so polite, I have other engagements." Mr. So-and-so turned and bowed slightly.</p>
<p>"Sir, you are truly a busy person of importance. So we won't stand on ceremony. Do you have other families to attend to today?" The manager asked as he escorted him to the door.</p>
<p>"Well, three more... Haha, I really can't turn myself around."</p>
<p>"Thank you for your trouble, Mr. So-and-so." The host gave a deep, ninety-degree bow as he stepped into the car.</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so was a prominent figure in society and the wedding officiant here, so everyone talked about him at the banquet.</p>
<p>"Mr. So-and-so's presence is truly an honor to our humble abode. Isn't it so? He is a well-known figure, known by women and children, and very difficult to invite!"</p>
<p>"Does he accept every invitation? If not, would he really bother to come and cut ribbons, officiate weddings, etc.? General Manager Yan has already prepared a generous thank-you for him! Haha..."</p>
<h3>Mother Sweeping Rice</h3>
<p>— Chen Qi made</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) A Touching Friendship</p>
<p>When Begonia regained consciousness for the second time, the first reaction he felt in his body was the pain in his face. It was excruciating, more painful than a bird pecking at an insect, truly like dozens and hundreds of silk needles pricking into his muscles. Especially his left eye, it was both painful and itchy, making him unable to resist raising his right hand to touch it.</p>
<p>But as soon as his hand was halfway there, he felt someone holding it down. Then, he heard a woman's voice gently saying in his ear:</p>
<p>"Don't move! It won't hurt after a while." Only then did he open his only remaining right eye. In the strong electric light, he found that what he saw was almost all white: a white ceiling, white curtains, white tables and chairs, a white bedspread, even the clothes worn by the people walking around the room were white.</p>
<p>"Where is this place?" After suffering excessive stimulation, his brain felt somewhat dizzy.</p>
<p>"Yuqin, can you forgive me?" A very familiar voice rang out in front of his bed. He peered around with his right eye for a long time before discovering that among those people dressed in white, one was actually Yuan Shaowen.</p>
<p>Although Shaowen still managed a faint smile, his expression was so miserable. He couldn't comfort Begonia, but instead reminded him of the scene that had unfolded a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>He knew that he was finished! With such an ugly face, not only could he not perform, he simply couldn't even stand in front of people! He really wished he could tear off all the gauze bandages on his face right away.</p>
<p>"Please rest quietly for a few days!" Shaowen held his hand and said, "Everything is on me."</p>
<p>"Your life is definitely not in danger," said someone wearing glasses who looked like a doctor.</p>
<p>A few drops of tears slowly rolled out of Begonia's wide-open right eye.</p>
