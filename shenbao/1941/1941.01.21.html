<h3>有可修正的日常生活</h3>
<p>臘鼓頻催，朔風怒號，如此天時人事，原極尋常，但今年上海却越顯得一般社會的苦樂懸殊。患在不均，自是通病。此時此地則因在畸形發展之中而不均愈甚。富家巨室，碩腹大賈，持續它們的奢侈淫靡生活，可謂自昔已然，而今年上海在所謂特殊的時勢與市面之下，有明目張膽的榨取，有喪天害理的掠奪，不同其方面方式方法，又增添了無數暴富貧兒，造就了無數得志小人，此輩的忘形享樂，更屬不可嚮邇：這是今年上海的一面。至於小本營生的，薪給爲生的，小販苦力，以及失業的，避難的，乃至流落街頭的，直接爲了百物暴贵，間接爲了層層剝創，電漲價了，水漲價了，電車公共汽車無不漲價了，即使足不出户，無求於人，亦因捐稅加重，更影響於房租，忍飢耐寒，謂幸不死，至少亦必强自貶抑其經常的生活水準；這是今年上海的又一面。</p>
<p>我們不必遐想由不均而均的烏托邦。我們不原諒爲富不仁者，不羨慕富人享受，但望他們不復加害於人，亦就不必報之以詛咒。我們不必因目擊身嘗一般社會的苦樂懸殊而怨天允人。凡此所謂『不必』，祗因遐想了，詛咒了，怨允了，並無實益。</p>
<p>平心檢討自已的日常生活，觀察社會的一般生活，除了好多食不能飽，衣不能暖，僅免於饑寒至死的最可憐的活人之外，生活上不免尙有不合理之處，不經濟之處。倘若就習慣的生活之中，擺脫了習慣的見解，處處重加考慮，處處量力實行，則深信對於生活必有改進，必有實益。即以所謂量力而論，在習慣的見解下所量之「力」，亦未必準確；不妨澈底重「量」。例如食、一日三飧，並非必不可變更的制度。熟食是習慣，或有見解，以爲必須如此熟食，纔合衛生；其實食物有不可生食者，有不必熟食者，有不宜太熟者；理不宜太熟而習慣必煮之爛熟，是燃料不經濟，時間不經濟，抑且燬了其間的資養性能而太不經濟。半糙米勝於精白米，碎米同於整粒米，雜糧亦可代米。合理的飽，耍在足以養生；習慣的飽，却是塞滿了胃腸，而多耗了食物，多耗了消化力，種了病根又多耗了醫藥費，種種不經濟。弱了，病了，進補品，進藥餌，貴些在所不敢惜，以爲這是培本，似乎合理之至；其實還要科學分析，一般補藥中所含有益的成分究得百分之幾，千分之幾？直用菁華，所費幾何？電燈不能不用，有惜電而傷目者，自不足訓；然亦有受慣了亮的刺激，以爲非亮不可，其實不必要，或係過度；若早眠早起，電貴於我何與哉？通常家居，輒以爨洗購買等雜事，委之僕婢；以爲自己不會，其實一學便會；以爲歷來不慣，其實一習便慣，妻孥的溫飽尙成問題，室居處尙成問題，僅因體面而僱傭僕婢來硬撑塲面，其實不配亦不必有僕婢者，「上海灘」上眞多；由僕婢而連帶的不合理與不經濟，更不勝舉。家居煩悶而探親友，何若散步。電車公共汽車相率作無情的漲價，當然不容討價還價，然非必不可不坐；謂腰腿力量不夠，試問走過嗎？試走了十决八决，仍感乏力嗎？謂時間不夠，不能早些拔脚動身嗎？眞是不夠，不能走半程，乘半程嗎？不能半程，但祗走一站二站，不即是節省了一二站車資嗎？每日練習多走幾步路，經濟不必說，對於身體卻有意想不到的好處。凡此種種，說來瑣屑，但多數感覺生活艱難的市民，殆不免每人犯幾樣。倘若自抑制了遐想詛咒怨尤的情緒，試自修正習慣了的生活，必有幾分實益！</p>

<p>歐戰史痛（八）</p>
<h3>英法陣綫零亂回憶</h3>
<p>我和一班英國軍官在亞眠分手。我們雜在難民羣中，到達該地。城中難民充塞，車站左右更是人山人海，有坐在包裏上的，有坐在人行道上的，也有坐在舖道上的，都是精神萎頓，而有菜色。飯店中的伙食房，麪包店中的爐灶，雜貨店中的擱板，都被他們搜括一空，倒像蛆虫鑽吮屍體，使之毫髮不剩。</p>
<p>祇有救世軍給我一杯茶吃。我裏上軍毯，倒身便睡。</p>
<p>和我同來的梅列可大佐傳話給我說，留在亞眠，很是危險，因此他巳動身往布洛業。他本擬把英軍中的法國隨軍記者帶回巴黎，但因車輛缺乏，束手無策，所以把這一個實任轉交與我。</p>
<p>這個命令，傳出容易，實行却難。德軍巳經迫近，車站又被難民包圍得水洩不通。婦女被擠，發出尖銳的呼聲。到巴黎去的火車。祇有一班。有孩子的母親，像發在般把孩子塞進車窗，交給擠在車箱裏的陌生人，吿訴他說，你到了巴黎，再把這孩子還我吧！…</p>
<p>要在車廂中獲一個容身之地，巳是沒有希望。後來由一位聰明機警的軍官，想出一個通融辦法，把一輛行李車，預備把火車站和法蘭西銀行分行的現款送往安全地點，准許我們擠入車子。</p>
<p>我們擠在被德機追擊的火車裏，立在滿裝銀錢的箱子空隙間，就這樣地到了巴黎。在平常有行兩小時可達，現在却費了十五小時。每經于個交义路口，總有大羣難民如潮水一般的擁擠着。我所率領的一班報界朋友裝束異樣，與法軍制服不同，便引起了他們的注意。我又聽見羣衆在那裹交頭接耳的說他們是傘兵！在某處車站上，有一個婦人跑來吿訴我，巳在後面一節車上發現一個喬裝軍官的間諜，被警察用手槍擊斃了。這事是眞是假，，不得而知，但法軍崩潰後，民衆猜疑懊喪的情形，由此可見一斑。</p>
<p>這行李車上的管理員，是一個身體强壯，頭髮斑白的法國老人，却依然神色自若，行所無事。</p>
<p>他伸出兩臂，擂住車門，對難民羣說，「我絕對沒有辦法！你們決不能進來！這節車子裏，載着銀錢貴重，我奉命不准閑人上車，我也決不讓人上車。太太們，請不要弄錯，我並不是毫無心肝。只怪你們為什麽要拋棄家庭，倉皇出走？是因為你們村鎭上掉下一顆炸彈嗎？那有什麽要緊？在一九一四到一九一八年間，我會看見過無數炸彈，無數魚雷，無數砲彈，比現在正要厲害得多。可是人人都毫不在意，人人都不逃跑。你們說什麼？說你們不是兵士嗎？嘿，你們實在都是兵士。這决戰爭中，人人都遭受攻擊，因此人人都是兵士。你們不知道阻斷道路，擁塞車站、延遲火車，妨礙行軍，無異是幫助敵軍，為虎作倀？時到如今，我們只有一件事最要緊，就是爭取最後的勝利。」</p>
<p>火車行駛甚緩。德國轟炸機盤旋天空，想破壞地面上的鐵軌，英國戰鬥機叉追逐着敵機，想把他們趕跑。路堤上有幾個婦人指指天，又指指地，喜形於色的指點給我們看，一架被擊落的德機巳粉身碎骨了。我望那車當時，却依然不作理會，自顧自檢點錢箱。這時候我仍有一綫希望……但是一見沿亞眠到克來爾鐵路錢倉皇逃避的難民羣，不禁又發生一種感象，有如洪水泛濫，無法遏阻。</p>
<p>車抵巴黎，我已精疲力盡。我此時只有一個念頭—把我同伴和我在撤退時沿途的見聞，儘速報吿當局，或者不無小補。我們想有幾種較易採用的辦法，可以阻止敵軍一再運用而一再成功的狡謀。我立即草一節略，準備送交萊諾總理，促他注意下列幾點：把各村中老朽無能的司令官撤換，易以勇敢有為的靑年軍官，禁止平民逃難，採取防禦燒夷彈的方法和其他性質類似的措置。</p>
<p>我到陸軍部時，萊諾的外交秘書主任馬奇利對我說，「請稍待，總理即將親自如見」</p>
<p>少頃，果然將我引入總理辦公室，我就把節略呈上。但這時他巳四面楚歌，成為衆矢之的。我們所提出的和建議，能吾發生作用，我已不敢存非分之想。這時候的萊諾好像一個驍勇的拳鬥家，雖不甘屈服，竭力支撑，但已頭昏目眩，手忙脚亂，不免招架為難了。我在那裏祇停留一分鐘，臨去時我問總理，「你看還有希望嗎？」</p>
<p>他答道，「病人祇要還存一口氣，醫生總向他家屬說「尙有一綫生機。（未完）</p>

<h3>多頭痛斬條子　金市跌風突起　猛跌二百廿三元</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤市况、遽吿猛瀉、達二百餘元、初承前日堅勢、開盤後一度漲至六千九百三十元、嗣因傳說美國將計劃凍結軸心國外滙、料本市美滙價於六元凍結、致滙市突起賣風、走勢奇鬆、金市於多頭斬殺、及滙票商拋空勢力下、步退九百八百七百六百四重大關、在跌至六千五百元、午刻銀號如天元及現金號等買入維持向上、午收為六千六百三十元、後市初况依然不振散戶進至六千六百三十元、後重降達六千五百六十元、嗣因滙市趨軟、滙票商等力購、挺達六千六百九十元、但銀號祥興奮售、收盤僅為六千六百四十元、比上週末猛跌二百二十三元、全日交易甚旺、約一萬餘兩、銀樓飾金步降三十元、達六百七十元、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤有四百卅元上落</p>
<p>晨初人心本巳堅挺、乃上日塲外聞巳做達六千八百八十元開盤、銀號帮來進、吿六千九百元、比上週六收市高三十七元、並聞外滙開出、吿美平英緊、銀號帮買興逾濃、未幾漲至六千九百三十元、嗣因外滙已露鬆象、滙票商新豐等先塞、金號帮大豐曁銀號等跟售勇猛、連入九百元、與八百元大關、挫達六千七百八十元、稍頃銀號天元入市搜購、終被拉高至六千八百四十元、但外滙鬆勢奇速、因傳滙票將於　滙六元價凍結、於是賣風擴大、跌勢猛劇、鼎盛銀號帮等傾售至六千六百元、不久因浮空乘賤補進、回起至六千六百八十元、奈外滙冉長、滙票商銀號拋售甚巨、霎時慘降至六千五百元低價、後天元及現金號成記等來購、復走上游、收盤前高達六千六百七十元、而散戶塞出、結果僅六千六百三十元、午後開盤為六千六百元、而散戶零星搜入、微高數十元、達六千六百三十元、嗣於銀號多頭斬殺、再掀入六百元關、又降至六千五百六十元、不久滙票商金號等力進、外滙聞斯時帶軟、恒記亦買、頹勢稍挽、晋至六千六白九十元、此後係銀號祥興獨出、達六千六百四十元收盤、比上星期六收軋跌二百二十三元、全日上落竟達四百三十元、現金號之本脾金售價較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>外幣一致下瀉</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚亦市價、一漲即跌、英美金鎊、因亦一致暴落五元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票始曾高至十九元、旋因謠傳黑市外匯或將凍結、致市勢步鬆、故各方供給奇旺、於混亂中一度退至十七元八角、卒為十八元二角、比上週六軋跌五角半、香港票供給亦旺、市價突跌、坎拿大及菲列濱票等均稍趨疲、日金票及朝鮮票略趨堅挺、前者為一元五角八分半、後者為一元二角三分、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大片圓肉回漲</h3>
<p>片生晒圓肉、近因乏到、市存至稀、兼之客方硬扳少出、價乃回好二三十元、至於雜路貨存數較厚、無甚變動、趨勢平定云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債成交見新紀錄　甲在八十元上丁戊亦出七十元</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、咋日市况又復奔騰邁進、在此抗戰期內、有此意想不到之良好市價、一般人均驚為奇蹟、幾使橋舌不下、其實本報早經提醒不可以普通眼光以視昔日之公債、故此種現象、殊非意外、所謂各公司行號之股票、大半已高至票面、以上各種賣品已高數倍以及籌碼枯竭等說詞、猶係皮相之談、其眞實原因、當不在此、姑待事實證明、目下各種行市、均巳超出法定限價、下午各種行市再見新高價、丙種已至七十二元以上、乙種已至七十六元、前途恐尙非止境、不過在高價時連漲多日、當防回風耳、昨日上午交易行情不過略好數角、進出各戶尙屬不甚激烈、午後漲風驟猛、再漲一元許、怡泰吸收最猛、大通加碼、同康九成仁昌易中潤德均一二十萬或二三十萬買進、市上盲從買進者允為熱鬧、雖有七號裕興及鼎康順昌潤利及益昌供給曾見一度曲綫、仍復上騰、可見供求尙相懸殊也、結果再漲七角半至一元四角半、成交約有四百餘萬、開晤盤以來成交數目之新紀錄、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股五十股、價為二十一元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市、謠傳外人在美資產有受凍結可能、致使滙市轉鬆、股市亦略受其影響、開盤因買戶不多、市况即稍趨軟、嗣各著名股低價下不乏進者、下午價格極少變化、橡皮股寗靜、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬慘跌卅元</h3>
<p>連日七十八落之紗市、昨則又復大上大下、高低價相差五十元左右、此因投機商一致拉提之結果也、然人心依然望升者占多數、所以有此劇烈的反動下瀉也、但就事實而論、殊不足為奇、不過實際交易仍屬暗淡、而雙馬紗獨高過任何紗價、全係金子商及證券幫所吸收之故也、二十支雙馬高峯曾見一千四百五十五元、低盤價為一千四百零六元、今日有紗三件運廈門、九十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開承上日之謠風續升、首盤價為一千四百四十六元、在此買風圍襲之下、一律拉進、微升至一千四百五十五元、在一千四百四十至五十元迴旋殊久、但後聞外滙放長、金價慘落、紗市才遭打擊、在風驀地而起、謂美國有對於各國之存款凍結之說、於是市塲急變，買者轉賣，市盤乃起劇烈之反動、而下跌至一千四百零六元、後以浮空扒補、又見回上至一千四百十一元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千六百四十包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　三一〇　同行　六、三〇〇</p>
<p>寗波　三〇　統計　六、六四〇</p>
<h3>棉市亦軟化</h3>
<p>現棉情況略帶平象、因紗市大跌、而外滙放長、致人心軟化、同時廠家辦胃平庸、惟同行心思較堅昂耳、</p>
<p>另訊紐約棉市、平靜無定、先因同業購進而漲、後因紐奧倫期售出回跌、結果較之上日收盤價格的小三四磅音、印棉停市、昨日預測較低半羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、咋日滙兌逐有放長、終因新年將近、各方行將了理結束、故最近數日內暫吿靜淡安閒也、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米到七萬包之數　米蠧仍思把持卒致漲而復落</h3>
<p>昨日洋米、因評價委員會前日將各色洋米價繼續評低元砠、若一號西貢為八十六元、一號邏暹八十七元、安南粳八十八元、火絞八十五元、二號西貢八十一元、二號邏暹七十九元、小絞七十六元、砶尖七十五元、米菉七十三元、混合碎七十元、並公吿定本月廿三日起停市、所以一般店家均需備積、同時客販方面、以年關咫尺、亦不再扳持、市貨擁擠、形成供求相仿之局、然特別高貨、仍有堅守不出、因此各米一度拉起四五角、然定貨續有多起成議、獲利多頭亦隨市吐出、市乃漲而復落、午後以定貨與到頭兩湧、回籠期貨賣風尤旺、各檔英華司期貨立被抑低半元至一元、新成交計達孚小絞二三月份一千五百噸、價八十一元一角、建源一號西貢二月份七百噸、價九十元零七角、愼記又一千噸、價九十元零八角、回籠貨約近千噸、計一號西貢二月份九十元零五角、二號一二月間八十六元、小絞一月十三裝八十四元、二月五日八十六元半至八十六元、二月份八十四元至八十三元八九角、現米交易的有七八千包、計一號西貢高自陳貨開八十六元、八十五元半、新貨售八十四元半、八十四元、二號陳貨仍為八十一元至八十元、新貨七十八七元、一號邏暹八十四元至八十二元半、二號七十六七元、火絞八十三四元、小絞七十四元八角至七十四元、中關米菉六十九元、碎尖高六十七元牛、中六十四元二角、决六十一二元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、因時將臘底、販戶轉稀、到貨寥寥無幾、貨主手中懷有陳貨者、亟需銀根應用、再難守持、反都鬆脫、所以店胃雖爽、不以到稀而市面有所變化、且視形勢不若週前之堅、計開常幫原包白粳一百零八元、崑山中關原包白粳百零四元、斛見高白粳百零四元半、次至百零二元、靑角原包薄稻百零一元半、百零一元、斛見九十八元半、九十七元半、</p>
<p>糯米去路因時令應用、較前稍廣、但以存底頗豐、處此期間、懷貨者均思脫手、致市况猶難回好、售價與週前無相軒輊、宜溧國元仍開九十元左右、香港白元七十七八元至七十五元、</p>
<p>洋米來源旺盛、怡和洋行明生輪、由杳港運來一萬二千三百三十八包、貴生輪亦由香港裝來一萬三千九百二十八包、另有苞米六百包、兩輪均於前日（十九日）到滬、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、華綸洋行格蘭輪、直接由西貢裝來二萬七千九百九十包、前日（十九日）抵埠、停靠東鴻升碼頭起卸、昨日太古公司湖北輪到埠、由香港裝來一萬四千五百零四包、另有苞米四百包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起却、前咋兩日四輪裝來洋米、共計六萬八千七百六十包之鉅、（祖）</p>
<h3>兵船粉到一萬包　粉市先緊繼疲</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉市况、初緊繼疲、上午開盤、因歲暮在即、本客需要者尙稱熱烈、銷路仍以花鳥鐘樓牌兩種為主品、花鳥較鐘樓牌子為活、售價初開二十四元八角、旋以金市猛小、回降至五角半、後市更傳太古公司岳州輪新到兵船洋粉一萬包、散戶略有傾吐、市面暗鬆二三角、惟行囤手貨、均以寗券發行消息利多、大都把持不脫、致買賣頓失常態、良以雜糧市塲交易僅祇一天、各方均備結束、市面巳少變動云、</p>
<p>洋粉繼續來滬、怡和洋行貴生輪十九日到滬、除裝來大批洋米外、又由香港裝來麵粉五千包、又太古公司湖北輪昨日抵埠、亦有麵粉一千五百包運來、（祖）</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥交易、更見淸寂、因年關已迫、各廠停工在即、日廠與華廠、進胃均已怠懈、而各貨存到兩薄、執貨者亦都待守紅盤再售、故市面無形停頓、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市前途更難</h3>
<p>兩日來紐的橫濱皆無市、本埠「商品檢騐局」對於各項生絲、仍在停止檢騐中、故交易亦難展開、目前少數能出口者之生絲、乃以二百五十元之代價（每包計）於不公開形式下購得出口證之故、一般絲商、咸以舊歷年關間急切需用現款、故於不得已下只能出此高價以求脫售、然內地生絲市價、白當因此而更趨下游、故觀望生絲前途、益形困難、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價隨紗立降</h3>
<p>廠布　先漲繼跌、乃因市傳美將凍結軸心國存款、紗市暴跌、布價立吿軟化、浮多競求脫售、市盤混亂、白貨粗細布斜紋一部份跌每疋二角半至五角、漂染布平平、春令細紗綫織品價仍堅挺、本街成交各布五百餘件、溫甬幫辦一九〇號士林竹漂布細布等貨近百件、粵閩幫辦府綢色布等二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　因紗價狂跌、散戶轉賣、市盤步軟、晨開龍頭細布四十穴元、後市最低價小至四十五元、但終以同業心思穩定、收盤時又見回升為四十五元三角、四君子嗶嘰一元二角六分三七五、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭十一件運厦門、三百四十件運香港、又四十件運新加坡、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價疲軟</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯放長見軟、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白初平後跌、外棧貨八十二元半、八十二元、八十一元、八十一元七角、跌一元、二月十日打單、初市反好二角、爲八十三元四角、旋降至八十二元、最小為八十一元四角、後回至八十二元四角、小八角、荷赤六十六元半至六十六元、小一元、太古車白小四五角、B嘜八十二元半至八十二元、DY嘜八十元至七十九元半、HX嘜七十九元九角至七十九元五角、餘乏成交、</p>

<h3>美匯昨又放長　法幣價值益堅挺　各業深明大義拒收雜鈔　外商銀行表示步驟一致</h3>
<p>中國自民國二十二年廢兩改元、確立銀本位後、於二十四年十一月、始實行法幣制度、成立發行準備管理委員會、集中現銀、分區保管、嗣後中國貨幣始不受世界銀價漲落之影響、不但經濟日　繁榮、卽遇非常事變、亦可應付裕如、戰後因法幣政策收效、社會金融、得以運用靈活、安定如常、關於法幣之發行、向採穩健政策、戰前發行數額本屬太少、不但邊遠地方人民、咸苦籌碼不足、卽在腹地各市面、亦尙有通貨緊縮之感、戰後各地建設猛晋、通貨需要更殷、發行數目有相當之增加、但並不超過飽和點、而現金準備、依然充足、在其他各國之上、所以深得中外人士之擁戴、一切交易、均以法幣為主、</p>
<p>美匯放長　法幣堅挺</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（二十日）晨華盛頓電傳美總統卽將簽署命令、凍結侵略國或連被侵略國在美之款項、上海滙兌市塲接獲此電、頗感驚奇、電文簡略、不足闡明上海各銀行在美存款將吾亦遭凍結、但僅美國有凍結此等款項之可能性、已使此間美元投機商大量傾吐、致法幣頓形堅挺、因寗方「中儲銀行滬分行」今晨開幕、開盤美滙五元二八一二五卽法幣十八元九角三分、合美金一元、較上週六收盤縮〇三一二五、惟凍結款項一電傳到後、美滙大批叶出、致美滙長至五元五六二五、卽美金一元合法幣十七元九角七分、迄午市况平靜、收盤美滙五元半、卽美金一元合法幣十八元一角八分、幣堅挺、股票與商品受影響而步落、惟衆業公所仍甚平靜、</p>
<p>寧行分行　開市一瞥</p>
<p>「　備銀行」上海分行、於昨日上午九時、在外灘十五號中央銀行舊址、經探捕嚴密戒備之下開幕、事前由「總裁」·「副總裁」·出面邀請各界人士觀禮、憑柬入塲、觀禮者簽名入內繳銷請柬後、領得日記簿一本、但銀錢業公會會員行莊、以及各業同業公會一致拒絕參加、而參加觀禮者、均為寗方人員及日本籍人、叉昨日有人曾往巡視、見「行員」二百餘人、均無公可辦、雖分「滙兌」「存款」等十數部份、組織似甚龐大、但因無人光顧、冷寂非凡、</p>

<h3>納粹外僑會中　重評地稅建議　英僑對自用地另提辦法　市政總捐增高將遭反對</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃悉、公共租界納稅外僑、星期四日（二十三日）在跑馬廳舉行特別大會時、納稅英僑將提出建議、重行評定界內地主自用地產與未開發地之稅率、俾能减輕小納稅人之繳稅重負、</p>
<p>自用地產　增稅什四</p>
<p>查目下公共租界地主自用地產稅、仍為每方呎一元三角左右、至將提於納稅人特別大會之建議、則主張授權工部局、對地主自用地產之現行評價、加徵附加稅百分之四十、而自本年初起實行、此項附加稅、乃暫時實行之辦法、以待刻正研究地價問題之委員會對界內地產完全重行評定價値、</p>
<p>空地之稅　似可提高</p>
<p>建議中並主張對地主自用地產雖　附加稅什四、對租用地產加稅、則以較一九三九年之稅率提高百分之四十為限、此外、該建議主張授權工部局、對未開發地稅、增收巨額附加稅、所增之數、由工部局決定、</p>
<p>小納稅人　負擔减輕</p>
<p>據一方人士聲稱、上述建議中各點、若獲納稅人之贊助、則小納稅人之納稅重負、將大為减輕、而此新建議、理由極充足、因目前對地主自用地產評定之價、仍以一九三七年之價値為根據、市政總捐則巳從一九三七年之百分之十四激增至百分之二十七、工部局且擬增至百分之四十、此點星期四日若經納稅外僑核准、即予實行、聞新建議、諒可獲英僑聯合會會員與納稅日人之擁護、</p>
<p>市政總捐　必遭反對</p>
<p>惟星期三日大會中、納稅日人對於市政總捐附加稅增至百分之四十、料將加以反對、據本市日文「上海每日新聞」載稱、納稅日人聯合會昨（十九日）在蓬路日本總會舉行會議、決議反對附加稅百分之四十、</p>

<h3>歲幕的花市</h3>
<p>— 愛歲</p>
<p>血紅的猩猩木，把國歷新年點綴得異常美觀，可是一剎那間，國歷新年便也算隨着猩猩木的凋萎而逝去了。</p>
<p>近幾天來，正當寒梅含苞待放的時光，這是孤島上花市透來的消息，否則也無從得知梅花快開了，因為整個的孤島上是充塞了人和房屋。梅花更吿知我們農歷的新年快將到來。剛把國歷新年送去了不到一個多月，而叉在準備迎接農歷新年，而且是格外興奮。</p>
<p>梅花一開，探梅是件何等風雅的韻事。在往年，京滬杭甬兩路上總要運載着不知多少的「風流雅士」，到鄧尉孤山上去踏雪尋梅。可是自戰事發生以後，孤島上的人士便無形中變成了籠中之鳥，有翅難展了。然而筆者仍舊很有與地在歲暮的花市上，作了一番「人擠人「踏柏油路」式的探梅，這種「雅興」可說是少有的了。</p>
<p>最初的目的地便是在望平街慈淑大樓一帶，這是一年一度的「探梅勝地」，而在外國墳山一排牆壁上，已組成了一扇臘梅，天竹和寒梅的大屏風。這樣的「勝景」一年有一度，而且一定在歲暮的時光，舉行這不的而同的展覽會，我便首先向一枝枝的紅梅一「探之下，確見得伊正在含苞待放。花的精神雖不大飽滿，可是從鄉人口裏所討的價錢，每一紮也耍二三元左右，不過單瓣的野梅比較便宜一些，而綠梅却要貴得多。這種價錢眞是可觀，尤其在這幾天。</p>
<p>天竹蠟梅陳列得也不少，天竹纍纍殷紅的子，帶着片片翠綠的葉，襯托得很是可愛。在花市上所見的，價錢比較便宜一點的，每一株的子數寥寥無幾，葉子又打不起精神，也要賣到三塊錢一株。如果像樣一點，每株上能有二串紅子，竟要賣到二十二塊錢一株，這種價錢大可驚人，眞是望天討價，但是比較心平的鄕人，一塊錢也能買到天竹蠟梅了。在購買時，必須留意，吾則出了好價錢，還買到次貨的天竹，因為有些天竹有葉無子：有的有子無葉；有的子結得不多；於是那些聰明的鄕人便把它併紮起來，變成了一株十全十美的天竹，價　也賣得起了。今年天竹價錢眞是所謂「熱昏」，就是一棵有根可種的天竹也不消這價錢。如果在鄉下，就是送人恐怕也少受人家的歡迎。天竹和蠟梅眞是一對天生的配偶，「開花」和『子變紅」都是在同時發生，綠葉配紅子，再加上黃花一襯是多麽動人呀！</p>
<p>蠟梅以素心而磐口的最佳。所謂素心就是花心和花瓣是一樣的顏色，普通以紅心居多。所以素心蠟梅較為名貴，而香味也最馥郁。所謂磐口就是花瓣是圓而略帶卷的，並且花瓣和花瓣間排得很密接，好像一隻磬的口。如果，不是素心磬口蠟梅，香味也淡，俗稱「狗蠅」蠟梅，它的價格低落得多。可是花市上所見的，素心　梅尙多，但是磬口的不多見，眞是美中不足。不過今年的價錢也不廉，一株四五尺左右的蠟梅竟要賣八元，和一株天竹，共計三十元大洋，眞是少有的奇蹟。筆者被這價錢嚇到了慈淑大樓的國花市塲。</p>
<p>在市塲的入口，陳列着不少的水仙。普通人總以水仙是重瓣的好，但是說穿了；重瓣的水仙却不是眞正老牌的水仙，而單瓣的却是老牌水仙分蟹爪和直株，蟹爪是用人工雕成，故價錢較貴，的一元左右一株而直株八角錢左右可買到了</p>
<p>踏進了市塲，盆梅着實不少，足足有一千盆左右，其中以屏風紅綠梅居多，盆梅盆景也有，可是都不配我的胃口。、劈開的梅樁的有二三十盆活像一根柴爿上挿着梅花。居然也能開花，將來還生綠葉，但根據植物生理上講起來，眞是不可解釋。再擠進國貨公司的園藝部，據說是一位花業巨頭殷祥麟氏手包辦的，其中以盆梅居多，一盆大紅梅。題獨鶴，一盆玉蝶梅題鹿梅，看它們的形狀，很為妙肯；而共中一大盆松竹梅歲寒三友，比較最有些意義，佈置得也最美化。最後擠出了國貨公司，便踏上了電車往百樂商塲去。</p>
<p>最初看見的是華興花園馬紹棠氏配置的老梅樁，很是蒼老，據說是由蘇州鄧尉山運來，紅綠梅都有，而且花是很茂盛的。再進去是徐昇昶陶器號，據說，是上海陶器業的權威，今年孤島上盆梅所用的盆大都由他經售的，並且兼售盆梅和金魚。最後映入我的眼簾中的是孔志淸氏的盆梅，也是最配筆者的胃口。他所佈置的盆梅，原料是相同的，但是佈置的方法是經過一番藝術的洗鍊，畢竟和普通花匠所裝的盆景不同。他所陳列的盆梅，的有百盆之多，雖不能說每一盆都是精品，但至少可以說看得入眼的比較多一些，而其中以「梅花書屋」一盆最有詩情畫意今把共佈置的情形略述一下：在一雙橢圓形盆中，分栽五株紅梅，搭配得異常過當，其下有茅屋數橡作為書屋，中有蜿蜒的小溪，一隔為二，上有小橋可通，真像一幅古書，現今還陳列在百樂商場。在日落西下的當兒，筆者才踏上了歸途。今年的探梅總算是這樣的探過了；說起來眞有些可憐。但是盼望明年眞能爬上鄧尉山去踏雪尋梅，去做一個眞正的雅人，那才有說不出的快樂哩。</p>

<p>人生</p>
<h3>我要還債</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>我負債，我負了一筆重債。</p>
<p>我並沒向人借錢，我也從不賭博，我更不做投機生意，我從來不抱僥倖之心，然而我却負了一筆債，一筆永遠淸償不了的重債。</p>
<p>當我在母親肚裏生長的時候，我就開始負債了。這筆債並不是爸爸遺留下來的，而是我自己帶來的。當我呱呱墮地的時候，我巳經在媽媽的懷裹做了十個月的房客了。母親把那安穩舒適溫暖如春的房子給我住，並不收我租金，可是我無論如何是欠了媽媽十個月的房租了。這是我所負的第一筆債。</p>
<p>從我到世界上來的第一天起，媽媽變成我的奶媽兼保姆了。我餓的時候，她立刻把奶頭塞進我的嘴裏；我哭的時候，她就抱我，搖我，安慰我；我疲倦的時候，她很自然地唱起催眠歌來了。她幾乎一天到晚不離開我的左右。這樣我又負了一筆不輕的債。</p>
<p>我有吃，我有喝，我有衣服穿，我有房子住，我是一個幸福的人兒。後來爸爸把我送進學校去，在那裹，有誨人不倦的敎師，有切磋琢磨的同學，有增長智識的書本，於是，我又欠上一筆重債了。這次，爸爸，學校，國家，和社會是我的債主　。</p>
<p>我負了一筆重債，這筆債務一直掛在我的心頭。我的債主雖然不曾向我追索欠款，可是我感到沉重，我感到不勝負担。我一方面感激在我身上放賬的債主，另一方面覺得債主對我期望的重大，我感受到一種强大的壓力。這筆債務我雖淸償不了，可是我是非得淸償不可的。</p>
<p>我要還債，我要淸償這筆永遠還不了的債務。這不但是我的義務，也是我的責任。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>端起薄粥時</h3>
<p>— 鞠</p>
<p>當我每一次用手端起飯碗，把薄粥準備呵進嘴裏去的剎那間，手和脣不自主地顫動起來；心上的忐忑像粥上的熱氣，一般地上騰着。眼淚也汨汨下泄了。</p>
<p>老年的爸爸，在戰爭開始時就敲碎了飯碗；幾年來，他的神色更黯淡了，心境愈沉　了。上了年紀的人，怎禁得起憂慮一件又一件的打擊呢？頭髮白斑得使人觸目，身體逐漸削瘦下去，兩頰凸出得可怕；深陷的目光日常地對着我們呆望。有時　出他那焦黃得和他面色相同的手帕，把眼皮掩拭着；似乎在沉思，又似乎在泣啜。</p>
<p>我們更深深愧對母親的為人。她一方面耍百般慰藉像失去靈魂的爸爸，一方面要憐惜和惦念我們的行動。她的屢决想把爸的心境上所重懸着的憂慮」解除的努力，總是不能獲得絲微收獲。</p>
<p>你不是可出外去散散心嗎？」她像丐兒求乞般地，輕聲溫柔地向爸爸說。</p>
<p>「……爸爸垂下的頭，祇不過稍稍抬上了一點。</p>
<p>沒有一點第二步的動靜。媽祇得俯下頭，依舊把針穿進一疊疊的白色紙簿。她的機械的工作，使她的背脊駝了，眼花散了。有時我走近去向她說：「媽，息息力吧！」她可驚地看了看我，失神的目光中現出了猶豫，她的營養不足的面頰，在我的頭髮上親撫了一下說：「兒，你回來了嗎？」我告訴她經過，並且沒有被巡捕為難過。</p>
<p>「兒，你才該息息呢！你年輕，不應吃這樣的苦。」她一等我轉身，立刻又更緊緊地縫紉了。她的手不停地工作着，從清早到傍晚，從傍晚到我們都深眠後，她還孤筓地在燈光下把一本本釘成的本子整理着。她兩手所得，支持了我們的生活，但也侵奪了她的一切</p>
<p>當我把這碗血汗錢所換來的薄粥送進口裹去時，神經不由得抖動着，我彷彿見到爸爸的一副愁喪臉，媽媽傴僂地工作的情景，在粥氣沸騰間，我的淚珠也汨汨下泄了。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦慶鷗</p>
<p>紹文把身子略略移動了一下，還是很興舊地說：</p>
<p>「他本來就有圖畫天才，第二天我再去的時候，他已照着我所說的意思，畫了一張圖；雖然只是一片海棠葉和幾條毛蟲，倒也畫得很工緻，並且還在角上寫『觸目驚心四個黑字我因為覺得很難得，着實獎　了他幾句，還特地送了他一個鏡架，讓他把那幅畫掛起來。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，他又略略頓了一頓，隨手揣了面前的茶杯，但並沒有喝。</p>
<p>「上月裏，他的頭兒趙四再三來的他出去搭班，他因為母喪已滿百日，便不再堅拒，只是跟我討論，想把吳玉琴三個字掉換，以為太像女人了。我替他想了許久，想不出什麼好的名字，後來偶然靈機一動，才想到了秋海棠三個字；雖然一樣不脫脂粉氣，却還多少有些意義。他聽我說，便馬上贊成，我們三叔他老人家知道了，也說這三個字很喊得響，比吳玉琴的確好一些。反正他早巳出科，說改就改，還有誰能阻擋」？</p>
<p>瘦而且長的評劇大家俞仲遷先生，這才把他那顆上下皆尖的腦袋點了一點。</p>
<p>不錯，出了科的學生嬰改藝各是班子裏管不着的。」他接着又馬上堆出了十分自負的神氣說：「一記得三十一年前，馬鳳雲才從鳳鳴社出科，他也不歡喜那個名宇，便由兄弟替他改成馬玉鳳。他改名後第一天出　唱的是十三妹，有小寶芬的張金鳳，高壽林的公子，劉寳奎的鄧九公，周福…」</p>
<p>俞先生正吹得出神，不防驀地給那穿西裝的小夥子提出了一個破綻了。</p>
<p>奮鬬的人生觀（三十）</p>
<p>我的奮鬬，應付多少力量，視逆境的程度而定，逆境小，付小力，逆境大，付大力，我能控制逆境，逆境不能控制我，逆境應該怕我，我不怕逆境！</p>

<h3>午餐</h3>
<p>— 則之</p>
<p>兩隻時針劃成了一個三十度的角度，巳經是一點鐘了！可是我的腹中，還沒有加進今天的午餐，餓得巳在咕嚕咕嚕發着怪響，回到家裏去，飯早已冷掉了，不如往外邊去買了點點心吃吧！打定了主意，披上外衣就走出去了！</p>
<p>馬路上兜了一個圈子，中意的東西都貴得不得了，就買了兩塊蛋糕，想打回票啦。一隻怪齷齪的手，突然伸進了我懷中。一包蛋糕給他搶了跑走了。他媽的！我的東西也由得你們强搶嗎？眞的，我的東西他們是搶不著的！不上幾步，已經追上他，他的儀器已被我抓在手中了。他倒很識相，站着就不走了。怒火在我的胸中燃燒着揑緊了拳頭，高高的舉起了臂膊，恨不得打他個半死。可是，求饒似的可憐的笑容，十分不自然地流露在他的枯黃而污穢的瘦臉上；抖著他的嘴脣，——意思是要說點什麽話，但是沒有半點聲音流出他的喉嚨，這可憐的傢伙只是戰抖着，怒火給一盆冷水澆滅了；揑緊着的拳頭鬆了，臂膊軟得垂了下去。就在垂下去的時候，順手拿回了我的蛋糕。重新再看一看他的可憐的神態，腦海絞着亂蔴似的思想，不知不覺踏上了歸途。</p>
<p>雖然我的已經失掉的午餐，重新得到了，但是他的已經得到的午餐，仍舊失掉，乾聽着他的肚子咕嚕咕嚕地叫着！</p>

<p>某夫，卓別麟在他生日那天，舉行了一次盛大的宴會，是他親近的人。凡他的僕人，他的汽車次及秘書，都在被邀之列。席尾他唱了一支意大利名曲，當時，就有一位夫人問他：</p>

<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>因此身體也日漸衰弱，桑榆暮景，歡娛日少，時時要臥病。柳如是雖然為了殉國的事和牧齋意見有些不合，但夫婦感情方面仍是和好而沒破裂。不過牧齋對了這位華如桃李，凜若冰霜的愛姬，常覺神明內疚罷了。丙午某月，牧齋竟一病不起，醫藥無效。病中柳如是也很辛勤地侍奉湯藥，當牧齋易　之時，他緊握柳如是的纖手，長嘆一聲，顫着聲音說道：「謙益上負故國，下負愛卿，深悔以前沒有聽從你的金玉良言，雙雙殉國，博得萬古留名。現在我得到些什麼？偷生幾多年月而已，罪過滋多，今日我悔之不及了。願卿恕我。又我生平善逋，沒有積財。黃毓祺的事牽速及我，又幾毀家。我死後，這個重負拋與你去肩挑，這更是對不起的，千萬請卿看在昔日的情分，收拾我這臭皮囊，其他我也顧不得了。」牧齋說了這括，含恨而歿。柳如是哀哀痛哭，心如刀刺，忙着料理牧齋的後事，誰知堂上之屍方陳，責逋之　又起。這因牧齋生時逋負很多，而他對於鄉里族人等又大都沒有好感，有計多人不慊於他。湊巧牧齋的嗣子又是個文弱的書生，鄕里豪點之徒，很藐視他，以為此子易與，其勢可欺，所以大家聯袂而起，把索債為口實，一窩蜂似的趕上錢家大門，大聲噪呼，搪撞詬誶。嗣子宛如秀才遇了兵，有理購不淸，魂魄喪失，莫知所出。柳如是見了這種情景，悲憤不可自遏，便對嗣子泫然出涕，說道：「你不要恐懼，有我在此，足以當之。（四〇）</p>
<h3>修養要語（十七）</h3>
<p>從主觀的立場，看你的對方，越看越是生氣，覺得對方，故意與你爲難，非給他嘗些苦頭，不足以出胸中之氣，如果立在客觀的立塲，對方未必都錯，你未必都對，如果立在對方的立塲，更會發見許多可以原諒的地方。</p>

<p>為吳水剛傳威廉，演員除全體社員外，並特約影星劉瓊，舒適，周起，黃河，司馬英才，殷秀岑，上官雲珠，沈浩，嚴斐，維拉，張帆等參加，以一業餘劇社而具有此魄力，除了去歲新藝劇社的「海國英雄」之外，要算此「浮雲流水」了。該劇現在排演成熟，定一十三日起在卡爾登上演。</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Inaugural Address Calls on the People to Uphold Democracy, Inauguration Ceremony Simple and Solemn</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt today began his unprecedented third term in office. During his inaugural address, he called on the American people to forever maintain democracy in the face of this unprecedented crisis. He enjoys greater power than any previous president, and President Roosevelt, who is serving his third term, refuted the philosophy of those who generally believe that democracy has been lost and that tyranny and slavery will be realized. After President Roosevelt took the oath of office under the supervision of Attorney General Jackson, he said that democracy is not on the verge of dying. We know this because we already know that democracy will endure and develop. We know that democracy cannot die because it is built on the unconstrained initiative of individuals, both men and women, who are united for a common cause, a cause served by the free will of the free majority. President Roosevelt pledged to uphold and defend the United States and its Constitution. President Roosevelt insisted on adopting a simple ceremony for this inauguration. Therefore, the parade ceremony was shorter than in the past. The only new program was a surprise aircraft performance by naval and air force personnel. At this time, President Roosevelt reviewed the new military equipment in front of civil and military officials, diplomats, and representatives of the twenty-one American republics. The flags of the twenty-one American countries in the Americas fluttered in the field, expressing the atmosphere of friendship and unity among the countries of the Western Hemisphere. Thousands of people from all over the world went to Beijing to visit the grand ceremony, so Washington's hotels were full. In view of the world situation, the American security agencies were particularly vigilant during President Roosevelt's inauguration. The tension was greater than that of any previous presidential inauguration. At least 2,000 police officers and secret agents were involved in the security during the passage of the honor guard, and President Roosevelt was sitting in a car with tightly closed windows. Every police officer in Washington was on duty. In addition, eight detectives (uniformed police officers) and 300 people were transferred from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and Wellington to make up for the shortfall. Thousands of spectators also saw the latest equipment of the mechanized division, tanks, armored vehicles, technical teams, anti-aircraft artillery teams, and flat-fire artillery teams. All of these are the latest equipment for American defense, and they are now presented before our eyes. During the passage of the honor guard, dozens of fighter jets soared and hovered in the sky, and the sound of the planes echoed the cheers of the audience. During the inaugural ceremony, before President Roosevelt took the oath, Vice President Wallace declared, and President Roosevelt's historic speech concluded, "In the face of this unprecedented crisis, our strong purpose is to protect and maintain the integrity of democracy. In order to achieve this goal, we should invigorate the spirit of faith held by the American people. We will never retreat, we will never stop halfway, we are Americans, we should move forward courageously, and serve the country according to God's will." President Roosevelt did not specifically mention the section in his speeches on December 10, 1940, and January 7, 1941, which stated that the United States should become a military arsenal for democratic countries, but he took defending the principles of democracy as the main argument. President Roosevelt's oath was as follows: "I solemnly swear that I will faithfully perform the duties of President of the United States, and that I will do my best to maintain, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."

<h3>Wilkie Carries Prime Minister's Letter, About to Go to Britain for Inspection, Has Reservations About the Lend-Lease Act, But Supports the Policy of Aiding Democratic Countries</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull met with Wilkie at the White House yesterday to discuss the world situation. The President gave Wilkie a private letter asking him to hand it over to British Prime Minister Churchill, because Mr. Wilkie will soon be going to Britain for inspection. Mr. Wilkie first met with Mr. Hull at the State Department for a long time, and then went to the White House to meet with the President. Roosevelt had instructed the State Department in advance to give Mr. Wilkie all conveniences for his trip to Britain. After the meeting, Mr. Wilkie reported at the door when he left the White House, "The President wished me a safe journey. We discussed the general situation in Europe." "I cannot think that there is any other solution to this great war except British victory." Mr. Wilkie boarded a train to New York that evening. Before leaving, he said that after returning to the United States from Britain, he might compile his findings into a report or give lectures. Yesterday, Mr. Wilkie told the press that he had two reservations about supporting the President's Lend-Lease Act to Britain: (1) Congress should retain its power to control the nation's purse, so that it still has the power to restrain the President when he needs national defense funds; (2) Members of Congress should study the bill in detail and not rush it, so as not to give the President unnecessary powers. However, Mr. Wilkie also advocated giving Britain full assistance, saying, "If Britain wins, we have a good chance of escaping the war. On the contrary, we are in danger of being drawn into the war. Therefore, I deeply feel that the freedom of the United States will be greatly endangered if Britain cannot win." (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>New York - Wilkie, the defeated Republican presidential candidate, returned to New York last night from Washington after visiting President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull.

Mr. Wilkie also said that he would pay special attention to the British labor movement and would have a long talk with British Labor Minister Bevin. When pressed by the visit, Mr. Wilkie admitted that he strongly supported President Roosevelt's policy of aiding democratic countries. (International Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<h3>Isolationists Inciting Opposition to Lend-Lease Bill, Advocating That Aid to Britain Should Have Its Limits</h3>
<p>Washington - News today said that members of Congress who oppose the "Lend-Lease" bill proposed by the executive branch will launch an attack in Congress this week to prevent Congress from granting President Roosevelt the great powers stipulated in this bill. The opposition party's artillery fire against this bill will be launched tomorrow, at which time former Ambassador to Britain Kennedy will come to the House Foreign Affairs Committee to make his opinions known. The public expects opposition leader Kennedy to still advocate that the United States should provide large-scale aid to Britain, except for war, but will specifically clarify that the current emergency situation does not constitute a reason for Congress to transfer the powers and responsibilities listed in the bill. Socialist presidential candidate Thomas and Republican leader and former U.S. Minister to Canada McKnight will also attend on Wednesday to express their opposition. Aviation expert and isolationist stalwart Colonel Lindbergh and Howard newspaper political news editor General Johnson will also attend on Thursday to make their opinions known. House Foreign Affairs Committee opposition leader and New York Republican Congressman Fish also said that there are five other opponents of this bill who will also be called to attend. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman and New York Democratic Congressman Bloom said that he will do his best to conclude the committee's discussion on this bill this week. Several leaders in the House of Representatives, based on their personal views, all said that the House of Representatives might be able to pass this bill. Judging from the seats in the Senate, the executive branch actually has a majority of support. However, the non-interventionists in the Senate all firmly stated that they do not hope to agree or compromise, and will all come out to overthrow this bill. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Wheeler, a prominent American isolationist who was very active in opposing the passage of the aid-to-Britain bill last week, told people today that we have obtained a majority of senators in the Senate who oppose the aid-to-Britain bill. Most of these senators will vote in favor of providing a limited amount of money to aid Britain. Another method is to give Britain a gift of no more than 500 million pounds. We have no reason to grant the President full power under the guise of aiding democratic countries. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Pacific Airlines Refuses to Carry Japanese Passengers, Fearing Espionage of U.S. Defense Secrets</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun recently carried a telegram from its San Francisco correspondent saying that Japanese people going to the United States are often closely monitored by the U.S. authorities. There are many people who are refused to take Pacific money airlines, especially Japanese naval and army officers. A few days ago, a Japanese naval officer had booked a seat with Pan American Airlines. Before his departure, he went to the U.S. Department of the Navy to say goodbye and explained to the personnel of the department that he was about to return home on the Pacific line mail plane. Unexpectedly, two or three days later, he received a notice from Pan American Airlines canceling his seat reservation. The reason is that the U.S. authorities did not want the Japanese junior officers to spy on the U.S. defense situation on Guam and other islands in the Pacific from the plane. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Modifiable Daily Life</h3>
<p>The twelfth lunar month drums urge, the north wind howls, such timing and human affairs are very ordinary, but this year Shanghai seems to show the disparity between the joys and sorrows of general society. The suffering lies in inequality, which is a common disease. At this time and place, it is even worse due to the unbalanced development. Wealthy families, large merchants, and wealthy businessmen continue their extravagant and dissolute lives, which can be said to have been the case in the past. This year, Shanghai, under the so-called special situation and market, has blatant exploitation and outrageous plunder. Regardless of its aspects, methods, and methods, it has added countless nouveau riche and created countless petty people who have achieved their goals. The unrestrained enjoyment of this group is even more unattainable: this is one side of Shanghai this year. As for those who run small businesses, live on salaries, small vendors, coolies, the unemployed, refugees, and even those who are stranded on the streets, they are directly affected by the skyrocketing prices of all commodities, and indirectly by layers of exploitation. Electricity prices have risen, water prices have risen, and trams and buses have all risen in price. Even if you don't leave your home and don't ask for help from others, you will still be affected by increased donations and taxes, which will affect rent. Enduring hunger and cold, they say they are lucky to be alive, but at least they must force themselves to depreciate their regular living standards. This is another side of Shanghai this year.</p>
<p>We don't need to fantasize about a utopia where inequality becomes equality. We don't forgive the rich who are unkind, and we don't envy the rich's enjoyment, but we hope that they will no longer harm others, and we don't need to repay them with curses. We don't need to resent God or blame others because we witness and experience the disparity between the joys and sorrows of general society. All of this so-called "don't need" is only because fantasizing, cursing, and resenting have no practical benefit.</p>
<p>Calmly examine your own daily life and observe the general life of society. Apart from the most pitiful living people who are not able to eat their fill or keep warm, and are barely avoiding starvation and death, there are inevitable irrationalities and uneconomical aspects in life. If you break away from the habitual views in the accustomed life, reconsider everything, and implement everything according to your ability, then you firmly believe that there must be improvements and practical benefits in life. Even in terms of the so-called measuring ability, the "ability" measured under the habitual view is not necessarily accurate; it is better to thoroughly re-measure. For example, eating three meals a day is not necessarily an unchangeable system. Cooked food is a habit, or there is a view that cooked food is necessary for hygiene; in fact, some foods cannot be eaten raw, some do not need to be cooked, and some should not be overcooked. It is unreasonable to overcook food that should not be overcooked, but habit insists on cooking it until it is rotten, which is uneconomical in fuel, time, and even destroys the nourishing properties of the food, which is too uneconomical. Half-brown rice is better than refined white rice, broken rice is the same as whole grains of rice, and coarse grains can also replace rice. Reasonable satiety lies in being enough to nourish life; habitual satiety, however, fills the stomach and intestines, consumes more food, consumes more digestive power, and causes the root of the disease, which consumes more medical expenses, which is all kinds of uneconomical. When you are weak and sick, you take tonics and medicines, and you dare not spare the expense, thinking that this is cultivating the foundation, which seems very reasonable; in fact, it is necessary to scientifically analyze what percentage or thousandths of the beneficial ingredients are contained in general tonics? How much does it cost to use the essence directly? Electric lights cannot be used without, and those who save electricity at the expense of their eyesight are not worthy of instruction; however, there are also those who are accustomed to the stimulation of brightness and think that brightness is essential, but it is actually unnecessary or excessive; if you go to bed early and get up early, why should I care about the price of electricity? In ordinary homes, chores such as cooking, washing, and purchasing are often entrusted to servants; thinking that they themselves cannot do it, but in fact they can learn it easily; thinking that they are not accustomed to it, but in fact they can get used to it easily. The warmth and food of their wives and children are still a problem, and the residence is still a problem. They only hire servants to maintain their dignity, but in fact they are not worthy or do not need to have servants. There are really many people like this on the Shanghai Bund; the unreasonable and uneconomical aspects associated with servants are even more numerous. Instead of visiting relatives and friends when you are bored at home, why not take a walk? Trams and buses all raise prices mercilessly, and of course there is no room for bargaining, but they are not necessarily indispensable; saying that your waist and legs are not strong enough, have you tried walking? Have you tried walking eight or ten times and still feel weak? Saying that there is not enough time, can't you start earlier? If you really don't have enough time and can't walk the whole way, can't you take half the way? If you can't take half the way, but only walk one or two stops, isn't that saving the fare for one or two stops? Exercising and walking a few more steps every day, not to mention the economy, but also has unexpected benefits for the body. All of these things are trivial, but most citizens who feel that life is difficult inevitably commit a few of them. If you suppress the emotions of fantasizing, cursing, and resenting, and try to modify your accustomed life, you will definitely have some practical benefits!</p>

<h3>British Troops Recapture Gallabat on the British-Egyptian-Sudanese Border; British Land, Sea, and Air Forces in Joint Operations Intensifying the Siege of Tobruk</h3>
<p>Cairo: A communique issued here states that the Gallabat outpost on the British-Egyptian-Sudanese border, which British troops had previously withdrawn from, had been fortified by the Italian army and its defensive works were quite strong. However, British troops recaptured the area yesterday, and the Italian army in this section along the Eritrean district retreated. The British army recaptured this outpost at a minimal cost. The Italian army decided to retreat after suffering heavy casualties. British mobile units are currently pursuing them. Gallabat is located less than eighteen miles north of Eritrea, controlling trade routes leading to the eastern, southeastern, and northwestern parts of Eritrea. The Italian army invaded and occupied it in July of last year. A military spokesperson in Cairo praised the good news of the British army's recapture of the Atbara River Basin and the Italian army's decision to abandon Gallabat, considering it very satisfactory. The Italian army between Gallabat and Khartoum has now been completely cleared. The Italian army's abandonment of Gallabat is perhaps the end of the Italian offensive against Sudan. Although news received in Cairo did not specify the extent of the Italian army's retreat, it was reported that the British mobile units had penetrated the enemy's territory several miles. Recent news indicates that the Italian army is still retreating, with the terrain gradually rising several miles from the border. It is likely that the Italian army will continue to retreat from the plains to the mountains, and then resist from a position of advantage. The exact number of retreating Italian troops is not yet known. Other activities in Africa at the end of last week included another intense attack by British aircraft on the port of Tobruk. Large fires broke out near the gasoline pools in the port after being hit by bombs. According to a British Air Force communique, due to weather conditions, British aircraft were unable to see the extent of other damage suffered by Tobruk, but it was known that the bombs all landed within the target area. A British Air Force Australian pilot shot down an Italian bomber. At the end of the week, British aircraft also bombed a large transportation depot in Asseb. Military buildings in British Somaliland and enemy barracks five miles east of Umm Hagar were hit and caught fire. Asmara was also bombed. A British fighter plane that went on patrol over Libya did not return. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Today, an expert here strongly emphasized the importance of the British army's recapture of Gallabat, stating that when the Italian army withdrew on January 17, the Italian troops stationed in the area consisted of two divisions of imperial troops, two battalions of blackshirts, and a large number of indigenous troops. The British army had won small-scale victories continuously before defeating the enemy and forcing them to withdraw from their positions. Gallabat is the capital of the Sudanese Daga province. After the Italian army occupied it, it could control various railways and highways and serve as a starting point for attacking Sudan. Therefore, it is difficult to explain why the Italian army did not try to hold it firmly and abandoned it so easily. Currently, British reconnaissance teams are busy clearing out the remaining enemies, and the British Air Force is also providing strong assistance. The Italian army has suffered heavy losses from repeated bombings, and important transportation lines in the rear have also been cut off. In mid-December of last year, the Italian army made a final effort to attack the British army north of Gallabat in order to clear the position, but the result was a major defeat and heavy casualties. Since then, the Italian army has abandoned the initiative, and by Christmas, it was preparing to withdraw from its original position. On January 7, the headquarters of the Italian army northeast of Gallabat retreated. The British army followed and advanced. On the 17th, news came that the Italian army had withdrawn from the area, and the British army occupied it on that day. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: A reporter traveling with the British army in the Libyan Sahara telegraphed that the British Mediterranean Fleet has begun to jointly bombard Tobruk with the Air Force and land artillery units. British warships have been arriving at the coast all day to engage in shelling. British bombers are constantly circling over the desert, attacking airfields and aircraft within Libya. The British Imperial troops on land are currently busy repairing damaged transportation routes. The Italian army in Tobruk responds with intense anti-aircraft fire whenever British aircraft approach and attempts to use the fire of Italian cruisers berthed in the port to destroy the airfield south of the area.

<h3>San Francisco: German Flag Torn Down Incident; Germany Lodges Protest; US Expresses Apology</h3>
<p>Washington: On Saturday, the German consulate in San Francisco hung a large swastika flag to celebrate the establishment of the German Federation in 1871. Unexpectedly, a number of young people forcibly tore down the flag. At that time, thousands of people gathered outside the German consulate, causing traffic congestion. The police arrived and arrested five people, including two US Navy sailors in plainclothes. According to a spokesperson for the State Department, the State Department received a letter from the German ambassador afterwards, stating that the incident was an insult and provocation to the German flag. The State Department has apologized to the German government for this incident. Before the swastika flag was torn down, the German consulate had received a request not to hang the flag, or to hang it alongside the American flag. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>On the Eve of Roosevelt's Inauguration, German and Italian Leaders Meet; Strengthening Cooperation in Military, Economic, and Diplomatic Matters; It is Widely Believed to Be the Theme of Discussions Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the official Berlin communique stated that German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met to exchange views and discussed everything frankly, with complete agreement on all issues raised. The foreign ministers of both countries were present at the meeting. (20th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Swiss Capital: According to usually reliable sources reporting last night, German leader Hitler recently held another historic meeting with Mussolini to discuss the Axis powers' operational issues, but the details and location of the meeting were not disclosed. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Swiss Capital: According to reliable sources here, German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held a secret meeting yesterday in southern Germany to strengthen German-Italian cooperation in joint military, economic, and diplomatic actions. It is widely believed that the main item discussed was the issue of the Axis powers resisting the US's active aid to Britain plan. It is reported that the meeting will reopen today. It is widely believed that these two major dictators are drafting a new strategy for the Axis powers with their advisors, covering the entire Mediterranean region from Gibraltar to Suez and from Fascist France to Rabat. Diplomatic circles here believe that this meeting, whether in Munich or Salzburg, is being held on the eve of President Roosevelt's inauguration, and people are paying great attention to it because someone predicted several weeks ago that a new offensive by the Axis powers would be launched when President Roosevelt takes office. The same source predicted that an important joint declaration by Germany and Italy will be issued simultaneously when the US President takes office to achieve maximum effect. The news of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini has been banned from publication in Berlin and Rome, and officials have refused to confirm the news. Therefore, neither country's radio stations nor newspapers have mentioned the meeting. (20th International News Service Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zurich: Regarding the rumors in Roman newspapers that Hitler and Mussolini will meet in Germany soon, neither the German nor Italian capitals have confirmed it. However, political observers believe that the two dictators may hold another meeting soon because the recent victories of the British and Greek armies have changed the situation in the Mediterranean. What kind of assistance Germany can provide to the Allied forces, who have been repeatedly hit hard, will undoubtedly be the basis for discussion between the two dictators. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The British Broadcasting Corporation reported last night that well-informed sources in Britain believe that Hitler and Mussolini did indeed meet secretly recently. The company pointed out that the Rome radio station suddenly went silent from 12:20 PM to 8:40 PM yesterday, and when broadcasting resumed in the evening, it did not explain the reason for the interruption. Therefore, the company indicated that it was likely related to the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Post-War Pacific Shipping: United States Advances Rapidly; Possibility of Replacing Britain’s Position; However, Ship Tonnage Is Still Insufficient</h3>
<p>Washington – A report released by the Department of Commerce today stated that since the outbreak of the European War, the number of ships registered in the United States participating in trade between the United States and Liaodong has increased by 125%. However, the majority of commerce in this area is still transported by ships from other countries. This report, issued by the Department of Commerce's Transportation Division, has attracted considerable attention, as unofficial proposals for American ships to inherit British shipping routes in the Pacific, so that British ships can serve in the Atlantic and elsewhere, have been widely publicized. The announcement pointed out that in August 1939, one month before the outbreak of the European War, American ships participating in trade between the United States and the Far East totaled 59,000 tons. In October 1940, this had reached 330,000 tons. Although this increase is considerable, American ships account for only 25% of the total tonnage participating in this trade. The total tonnage of ships from various countries sailing between the United States and the Far East was 503,000 tons in August 1939, and 592,000 tons in 1940, an increase of 17.5% during this period. There has been no increase in the number of ships flying the American flag participating in trade between the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania during this period, although the total tonnage of ships from various countries participating in this line has increased from 61,000 tons to 64,000 tons, an increase of 5%, the tonnage of American ships remains at 10,000 tons. Therefore, observers express doubt as to whether the United States can replace any part of Britain's shipping routes in the Pacific. It is believed that the tonnage currently owned by the United States will either be used to expand routes to Latin America and elsewhere, or will fly the flags of Britain, Canada, or other parts of the British Empire. Experts believe that if the United States takes over Britain's shipping routes in the Pacific, America's current routes will inevitably be affected. Santessen, a shipping expert at the Department of Commerce, stated in a commercial newspaper that in June 1939, ships from the countries currently at war, or countries controlled by warring nations, accounted for 65% of the world's total merchant ship tonnage. Germany, Italy, and the regions currently occupied by the Axis powers own more than 30% of the total. However, many Axis ships have been captured by Britain, and Britain and its allies have acquired or can utilize the majority of ships from Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, and other countries. Mr. Sang also stated that as of November-December 1940, the loss of merchant ships due to various war causes, including those captured, appears to be close to 6 million gross tons, with Allied or neutral countries accounting for 4,325,000 tons. The monthly trend of these losses can be seen in the attached table. In June 1940, three months after the British Expeditionary Force withdrew from France, losses reached their peak. Since then, losses have decreased but have not fallen to pre-June levels. This may be because the Axis powers have gained more operational bases after the fall of France. It is interesting to compare the current wartime losses with the losses of the First World War starting from February 1, 1917, the date of the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare. After the commencement of this war, the average monthly loss for Britain, the Allied countries, and neutral countries was 270,000 gross tons, whereas from February 1, 1917, the average monthly loss was 473,000 tons. New ships built in Britain and old ships purchased from the United States have offset part of the losses. The United States has sold 148 ships to Britain, totaling 560,000 gross tons, and 43 ships to Canada, totaling 62,000 gross tons. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Sweden Reaffirms Strict Neutrality: Trade Suffers Great Losses Due to the European War</h3>

Although agreements have recently been concluded with the Soviet Union and Germany, and trade has revived, it cannot compensate for the loss of isolation from Western countries, especially the great loss in overseas markets.

<h3>Indian Sikh Community Issues Declaration: Resolves to Make the Greatest Effort to Assist Britain in the War</h3>
<p>Lahore – Leaders of various Sikh communities in the Punjab Province met yesterday and resolved to establish the Khalsa (Sikh) Indian Defense Association, aimed at making the greatest effort to defend India and ensure British victory.

The declaration also congratulated the Sikhs fighting on the Libyan front. The letter from the Maharaja of Patiala, which was read at the meeting, stated that we must fulfill the guarantee given to the British Empire last August, and support the war to protect the evolution of mankind. Since we understand that this is our religious duty, we must fulfill our promise to those who are fighting for the same ideals as us. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>A Painful History of the European War (8)</p>
<h3>Recollections of the Disorganized Anglo-French Front Lines</h3>
<p>I parted ways with a group of British officers in Amiens. We mingled with the crowds of refugees and arrived there. The city was filled with refugees, and the area around the station was even more crowded. Some were sitting on their bundles, some on the sidewalks, and some on the paving stones. They were all listless and haggard. The kitchens of the hotels, the ovens of the bakeries, and the shelves of the grocery stores were all ransacked by them. They were like maggots sucking on a corpse, leaving nothing untouched.</p>
<p>Only the Salvation Army gave me a cup of tea. I wrapped myself in a military blanket and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Major Meyerecq, who came with me, sent word that it was very dangerous to stay in Amiens, so he had left for Boulogne. He had intended to bring the French war correspondent from the British army back to Paris, but was unable to do so due to the lack of transportation. So, he transferred this task to me.</p>
<p>This order was easy to issue but difficult to carry out. The German army was closing in, and the station was surrounded by refugees. Women were being squeezed and发出尖锐的呼声. There was only one train to Paris. Mothers with children, like mad women, stuffed their children through the train windows, handing them over to strangers crammed into the carriages, telling them, "When you get to Paris, please return this child to me!"</p>
<p>There was no hope of getting a place in the carriages. Later, a clever and alert officer came up with a solution. A baggage car was being prepared to transport the cash from the train station and the branch of the Bank of France to a safe location, and we were allowed to squeeze into the car.</p>
<p>We stood in the gaps between the boxes full of silver coins, crammed into a train being chased by German planes, and that's how we got to Paris. The journey, which normally took two hours, now took fifteen hours. At every intersection, there were large crowds of refugees, like a surging tide. The group of journalists I was leading were dressed differently, not in French army uniforms, which attracted their attention. I also heard the crowds whispering that they were paratroopers! At one station, a woman ran up to tell me that a spy disguised as an officer had been found in the carriage behind and shot dead by the police. Whether this was true or false, I didn't know, but the public's suspicion and frustration after the collapse of the French army was evident from this.</p>
<p>The conductor of the baggage car was a strong, gray-haired French old man, but he remained calm and collected, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms, blocking the car door, and said to the crowd of refugees, "I absolutely can't! You absolutely can't come in! This car is carrying silver and money, and I am ordered not to allow anyone to board the car, and I will absolutely not allow anyone to board the car. Ladies, please don't be mistaken, I am not heartless. Why did you abandon your homes and flee in panic? Is it because a bomb fell on your town? What does that matter? Between 1914 and 1918, I saw countless bombs, countless torpedoes, and countless shells, much worse than what is happening now. But everyone didn't care, no one ran away. What are you saying? That you are not soldiers? Hey, you are all soldiers. In this war, everyone is attacked, so everyone is a soldier. Don't you know that blocking roads, crowding stations, delaying trains, and hindering military movements is tantamount to helping the enemy and acting as an accomplice? Now, only one thing is most important to us, and that is to strive for final victory."</p>
<p>The train moved very slowly. German bombers circled in the sky, trying to destroy the tracks on the ground. British fighter planes chased after the enemy planes, trying to drive them away. Several women on the embankment pointed to the sky and then to the ground, gleefully pointing out to us that a downed German plane had been smashed to pieces. I looked at the car at that time, but still didn't pay attention, and took care of checking the money boxes. At this time, I still had a glimmer of hope... but seeing the crowds of refugees fleeing in panic along the Amiens-Clermont railway, I couldn't help but feel a sense of something like a flood, unstoppable.</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Paris, I was exhausted. At this point, I only had one thought—to report our observations along the way during the retreat to the authorities as quickly as possible, which might be of some help. We thought there were several easier ways to prevent the enemy from using the cunning strategies that they had repeatedly used successfully. I immediately drafted a brief note, preparing to submit it to Premier Reynaud, urging him to pay attention to the following points: replace the old and incompetent commanders in the villages with brave and promising young officers, prohibit civilians from fleeing, and take methods to defend against incendiary bombs and other similar measures.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Ministry of the Army, Marchili, Reynaud's chief diplomatic secretary, told me, "Please wait a moment, the Prime Minister will see you personally."</p>
<p>Soon, I was led into the Prime Minister's office, and I presented the brief note. But at this time, he was besieged on all sides and became the target of everyone's criticism. I didn't dare to have any expectations that what we proposed and suggested would have any effect. At this time, Reynaud was like a brave boxer, although he was unwilling to give in and struggled to support himself, he was dizzy and flustered, and it was difficult to parry. I only stayed there for a minute. As I was leaving, I asked the Prime Minister, "Do you think there is still hope?"</p>
<p>He replied, "As long as the patient still has a breath, the doctor always tells his family, 'There is still a glimmer of hope.'" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance: U.S. Plans to Freeze Axis Funds; Forex Bulls Hit</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s foreign exchange market situation: HSBC’s listed prices showed no change. The unofficial British-American exchange market suddenly soared, presumably because the US exchange rate eased. According to news from New York, plans to freeze the assets of all foreign countries in the US are now awaiting presidential approval. This order will prevent funds from Germany, Japan, and Italy from entering or leaving the US. Therefore, the US exchange rate is also expected to be pegged at six yuan, and the bulls were greatly hit, selling off one after another. The firmest current US exchange rate was traded at 5.625 yuan, around 1:15 PM. However, there was still some interest in speculative buying at the morning opening. The February US exchange rate generally traded at 5.25 yuan. At the noon close, the current US exchange rate was quoted at 5.5 yuan. The market was strong first and then soft. Due to some purchases by Hong Kong Electric and others, the closing price of the current US exchange rate retreated to 5.4375 yuan, the British gold price was 3 pence 4.0625 yuan, compared to the Saturday close, the British exchange rate only eased 0.03125 yuan, the US exchange rate rose 0.125 yuan, while the forward rate eased sharply by 0.15625 yuan.</p>
<p>Speculators Dump En Masse</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rates were level between the British and the US dollar, the British against the Shanghai dollar fell by 0.0625, the US against the British dollar fell by 0.025, and there was no market against the Shanghai dollar, and against the French dollar. The official exchange rates listed by the Central Bank remained as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price: British gold was 3 pence 3.4375 yuan, and the US exchange rate was 5.325 yuan. Compared with the weekend closing price, the US was level and the British shrank by 0.03125. After opening, speculators still had the intention to enter, and the February US exchange rate was favorably closed at 5.25 yuan. The market was calm. At 9:30, HSBC announced the list prices, and all exchange rates were level. There was also no change in the silver equalization tax. After this, Chinese speculators suddenly started to dump. Rumors spread that the United States was planning to freeze foreign capital from the Axis countries, and that the US exchange rate would be pegged at six yuan. Therefore, operators considered the news bearish and sold off one after another. The market gradually became firmer. The US exchange rate for this month was traded from 5.3125 yuan by speculators to foreign banks, reaching 5.625 yuan. It was also heard that a certain American bank absorbed speculators' US exchange rates for this month at 5.5625 yuan, while Chinese speculators continued to dump at this time, selling the current US exchange rate to foreign banks until it eased to 5.625 yuan. However, foreign banks only heard of 5.5625 yuan for the current US exchange rate. By noon, speculators stopped selling, and the market slightly softened. The noon close spot price: British gold was 3 pence 4.375 yuan, and the US exchange rate was 5.5 yuan. Compared to the morning opening, the British eased by 0.09375 yuan and the US rose by 0.1875 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Ease More Sharply</p>
<p>The market was initially firm. Chinese banks traded the US exchange rate for this month at 5.53125 yuan. After 2:30 PM, Hong Kong Electric and others bought in, and the market trended softer. Speculators sold the US exchange rate for this month to Hong Kong Electric for 5.5 yuan and 0.4375 yuan. Until the evening closing, the trend remained stable. In the end, the spot and current British gold price was 3 pence 4.0625 yuan, the US exchange rate was 5.4375 yuan, the next month's British gold price was 3 pence 3.75 yuan, and the US exchange rate was 5.40625 yuan. Compared with the Saturday close, the British exchange rate was firm by 0.03125 yuan for both spot and futures, the US exchange rate eased by 0.125 yuan for both spot and this month, and the next month sharply rose by 0.15625 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Fluctuates Slightly</p>

<p>Tianjin Sees Tightening in Both British and US Currencies</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th (Monday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London and New York telegraphic transfers each softened by 0.0625, with London at 3 pence 6.25 and New York at 5.71875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 0.25 to 92 yuan. The unofficial price of "Lianchao" was 1.25 yuan, equivalent to 80.075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bulls Painfully Cut Losses; Gold Market Suddenly Plunges; Falls Sharply by 223 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the cooked red (chih) unofficial market suddenly plummeted, falling by more than 200 yuan. Initially, it carried on the previous day's strong momentum, rising to 6,930 yuan at one point after opening. Later, due to rumors that the United States was planning to freeze foreign exchange from the Axis countries, expecting the US exchange rate in this city to be frozen at 6 yuan, the exchange market suddenly saw selling pressure and the trend was surprisingly loose. Under the force of bulls cutting losses and exchange dealers selling short, the gold market retreated through the 900, 800, 700 and 600 major levels. When it fell to 6,500 yuan, silver shops such as Tian Yuan and Cash Store bought in to maintain upward momentum. The noon close was 6,630 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial market conditions remained sluggish. Retail investors entered at 6,630 yuan, then fell again to 6,560 yuan. Later, because the exchange market trended softer, exchange dealers and others bought forcefully, lifting it to 6,690 yuan. However, Yin Hao Xiang Xing sold it off, and the closing price was only 6,640 yuan, a sharp drop of 223 yuan compared to the previous weekend. The entire day's trading was very active, about 10,000 taels or more. Silver jewelry fell by 30 yuan, reaching 670 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained level.</p>
<p>Cooked Red (chih) Fluctuates by 430 Yuan</p>
<p>The public sentiment was initially strong. It was heard that the after-market was traded up to 6,880 yuan the previous day, and the silver shops came to buy, quoting 6,900 yuan, 37 yuan higher than the Saturday close. It was also heard that the foreign exchange market opened, reporting that the US dollar was level and the British pound tightened. The silver shops' buying interest was even stronger, and before long, it rose to 6,930 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange already showed signs of easing, exchange dealers Xin Feng and others sold first, and Jin Hao Bang Da Feng and silver shops followed the selling vigorously, breaking through the 900 yuan and 800 yuan levels, falling to 6,780 yuan. Soon after, Silver Shop Tian Yuan entered the market to search for purchases, and was eventually pulled up to 6,840 yuan. However, the US exchange rate eased surprisingly quickly. Because it was rumored that the exchange rate would be frozen at 6 yuan, the selling pressure expanded and the decline was sharp. Ding Sheng Silver Shop and others dumped it to 6,600 yuan. Before long, due to floating shorts buying in on the cheap, it rebounded to 6,680 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange rate rose, exchange dealers and silver shops sold off in large quantities, and it suddenly plummeted to a low price of 6,500 yuan. Later, Tian Yuan and Cash Shop Cheng Ji and others came to buy, and the downward trend slightly improved, reaching 6,670 yuan before the closing. But retail investors sold off, and the result was only 6,630 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 6,600 yuan, and retail investors sporadically bought in, slightly higher by tens of yuan, reaching 6,630 yuan. Later, the silver shops' bulls cut losses, and the 600 yuan level was once again entered, falling to 6,560 yuan. Soon after, exchange dealers and gold shops and others entered forcefully. It was heard that the foreign exchange market was soft at that time, and Heng Ji also bought, and the downward trend was slightly reversed, rising to 6,690 yuan. After that, it was only Silver Shop Xiang Xing that sold off, reaching 6,640 yuan at the close, a decline of 223 yuan compared to the Saturday close. The entire day's fluctuations reached 430 yuan. The selling price of the current gold at Cash Shop was more than ten yuan higher than that of Cooked Red (chih), and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The spot gold was listed at 5-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Also Drops Three Small Levels</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver jewelry per tael: lowered by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, continued to drop by 10 yuan at 11:00 AM, and then lowered by 10 yuan again at 11:30 AM. It rebounded by 10 yuan at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and then fell by 10 yuan again. As a result, Da Tong Heng listed at 670 yuan. The new peers had prices similar to the above, and the buying price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>All Foreign Currencies Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The cooked (chih) market price also rose and fell. The British, American and gold pounds, for example, all fell sharply by 5 yuan. The British gold ticket remained stable as before, and the market price stabilized. The American gold ticket initially rose to 19 yuan, but due to rumors that the black market foreign exchange may be frozen, the market trend eased. Therefore, the supply from all parties was surprisingly strong, and it once retreated to 17.8 yuan in the chaos, eventually reaching 18.2 yuan, a decline of 0.55 yuan compared to the Saturday close. The supply of Hong Kong tickets was also strong, and the market price suddenly fell. The Canadian and Philippine tickets also tended to weaken slightly. The Japanese and Korean gold tickets tended to be slightly firmer, the former at 1.585 yuan and the latter at 1.23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Large Slices of Dried Longan Rebound</h3>
<p>Sliced sun-dried longan meat, recently because of a lack of arrivals, is very rare in the market. In addition, the customers are resisting and releasing little, so the price has rebounded by 20-30 yuan. As for miscellaneous goods, the stock is relatively thick, and there is not much change. The trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Securities Public Bond Transactions See New Record; A at 80 Yuan, C-E Also at 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market surged again yesterday. During this period of resistance war, such unexpectedly good market prices have surprised the general public, almost rendering them speechless. In fact, this newspaper had already reminded everyone not to view public bonds with ordinary eyes, so this phenomenon is not unexpected. The so-called stocks of various companies and firms have mostly reached face value, and various commodities have risen several times above face value, and the saying that funds are drying up is just superficial talk. The real reason is not in these factors, and we await the facts to prove it. At present, various market prices have exceeded the legal limit. In the afternoon, various market prices saw new highs again, with Class C reaching over 72 yuan and Class B reaching 76 yuan. The future may not stop there, but after rising for many consecutive days at high prices, one should beware of retracements. The trading situation yesterday morning was only slightly better by a few cents. The transactions of various households were not very intense. In the afternoon, the surge intensified sharply, rising by another yuan or so. Ewo Tai absorbed the most intensely, Dah Tung increased its position, and Tong Kang, Jiucheng, Renchang, Yi Zhong, and Run De all bought in amounts of 100,000 or 200,000 to 200,000 or 300,000. Blind buying in the market was very lively. Although Yuxing No. 7, Ding Kang, Shun Chang, Run Li, and Yi Chang showed some supply, they still rose again, indicating that the supply and demand are still quite disparate. As a result, prices rose again by 7.5 cents to 1.45 yuan, setting a new record for the number of transactions since the opening of the grey market. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of New New Company stock were traded at a price of 21 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Enterprise Stock Market: Rumors that foreigners' assets in the United States might be frozen caused the exchange rate market to ease and the stock market to be slightly affected. Trading was slightly soft at the opening due to the lack of buyers. Later, many investors bought famous stocks at low prices. Prices changed very little in the afternoon, and rubber stocks were quiet.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton 　 Double Horse Plummets 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been declining for the past seven or eight days, rebounded sharply yesterday, with high and low prices differing by about 50 yuan. This was the result of unanimous price manipulation by speculators. However, most people still expect prices to rise, which is why there was such a drastic reactive plunge. But in terms of actual facts, it is not surprising. However, actual transactions are still sluggish, and Double Horse yarn, which is uniquely higher than any other yarn price, is entirely absorbed by gold merchants and securities firms. The peak price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1455 yuan, and the low price was 1406 yuan. Three pieces of yarn are being shipped to Xiamen today, and 90 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the rumors from the previous day, and continued to rise. The opening price was 1446 yuan. Under the assault of buying, prices were pulled up across the board, rising slightly to 1455 yuan, fluctuating for a long time between 1440 and 1450 yuan. However, after hearing that foreign exchange was loosening and gold prices plummeted, the yarn market was hit. The wind suddenly rose, saying that the United States was freezing deposits from various countries. As a result, the market changed rapidly, buyers turned into sellers, and the market rose dramatically, falling to 1406 yuan. Later, due to uncovered short covering, prices rebounded to close at 1411 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 6640 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 30 yuan. The amount bought by various parties is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 310 Peers 6300</p>
<p>Ningbo 30 Statistics 6640</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Also Softens</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly flat. Because the yarn market plummeted and foreign exchange loosened, people's sentiment softened. At the same time, factory purchases were mediocre, but peers' sentiment was relatively firm.</p>
<p>According to another report, the New York cotton market was calm and unsettled. Prices rose first due to purchases by the industry, and then fell back due to sales during the New Orleans period. As a result, prices were down by a small amount of 3/4 pound compared to the closing price of the previous day. Indian cotton was closed. Yesterday's forecast was half a rupee lower.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Yesterday, foreign exchange was gradually loosening, but because the New Year is approaching, all parties are about to finish clearing up, so the last few days will be quiet and leisurely.</p>
<h3>Food Grains 　 Foreign Rice Arrives in Quantities of 70,000 Bags; Rice Weevils Still Try to Take Control, Ultimately Causing Prices to Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice prices continued to fall, as the Evaluation Committee had lowered the prices of various types of foreign rice the day before. For example, Saigon No. 1 was 86 yuan, Siam No. 1 was 87 yuan, Annam glutinous rice was 88 yuan, Fire-milled was 85 yuan, Saigon No. 2 was 81 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 79 yuan, Small-milled was 76 yuan, Broken-tip was 75 yuan, Rice Sprouts was 73 yuan, and Mixed Broken was 70 yuan. Furthermore, the market was announced to be closed from the 23rd of this month, so most stores needed to stockpile. At the same time, merchants, because the end of the year was near, no longer resisted. The market was crowded with goods, forming a situation of similar supply and demand. However, particularly high-quality goods were still held back and not sold. Therefore, the price of each type of rice once rose by 40 to 50 cents. However, as more orders were agreed upon, profitable bulls also released their positions into the market, causing prices to rise and fall again. In the afternoon, with both orders and arrivals surging, the selling of returned futures was particularly strong. The futures prices of various companies, such as English-Chinese Co., were immediately suppressed by 50 cents to 1 yuan. New transactions included 1,500 tons of Dafu Small-milled rice for February-March delivery at a price of 81.1 yuan, 700 tons of Jianyuan Saigon No. 1 rice for February delivery at a price of 90.07 yuan, and another 1,000 tons of Shenji rice at a price of 90.08 yuan. Returned goods totaled nearly 1,000 tons, including Saigon No. 1 for February delivery at 90.05 yuan, No. 2 for December-January delivery at 86 yuan, Small-milled for January 13th shipment at 84 yuan, February 5th at 86.5 yuan to 86 yuan, and February delivery at 84 yuan to 83.89 yuan. Spot rice transactions totaled 7,000 to 8,000 bags, including Saigon No. 1, with old stocks opening at 86 yuan, 85.5 yuan, and new stocks selling at 84.5 yuan, 84 yuan. Old stocks of No. 2 were still 81 yuan to 80 yuan, new stocks were 78.7 yuan, Siam No. 1 was 84 yuan to 82.5 yuan, No. 2 was 76.7 yuan, Fire-milled was 83.4 yuan, Small-milled was 74.8 yuan to 74 yuan, Zhongguan Rice Sprouts was 69 yuan, High-quality Broken-tip was 67.5 yuan, Medium was 64.2 yuan, and Final was 61.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the approaching end of the lunar year, there were very few merchants for thick and thin glutinous rice and other domestic rice, and very few goods arrived. Holders of old stocks were in urgent need of cash and could no longer hold on, so they all loosened up. Therefore, although the shop inventory was refreshed, the market did not change due to the scarcity of arrivals, and the situation was not as firm as the previous week. The opening price for Changbang original-package white glutinous rice was 108 yuan, Kunshan Zhongguan original-package white glutinous rice was 104 yuan, Hulian high-quality white glutinous rice was 104.5 yuan, down to 102 yuan, Qingjiao original-package thin rice was 101.5 yuan, 101 yuan, and Hulian was 98.5 yuan, 97.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to seasonal demand, the market for glutinous rice was slightly broader than before, but because inventories were quite abundant, everyone holding goods wanted to sell them, making it difficult for the market to recover. Selling prices were not much different from the previous week. Yili national yuan still opened around 90 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan was 77.8 yuan to 75 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is strong. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng Wheel brought 12,338 bags from Chaogang, and Guisheng Wheel also brought 13,928 bags from Hong Kong, plus 600 bags of corn. Both ships arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 19th) and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Wah Lun Foreign Company's Grand Wheel brought 27,990 bags directly from Saigon and arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 19th), docking at the Dong Hongsheng Wharf for unloading. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Hubei Wheel arrived in port, bringing 14,504 bags from Hong Kong, plus 400 bags of corn, and docked at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. In the past two days, four ships brought a total of 68,760 bags of foreign rice. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Military Ship Flour Arrives, 10,000 Bags; Flour Market Tightens Initially, Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market was tight at first and then weakened. The market opened in the morning, because the end of the year was approaching, and the demand from local customers was still quite strong. Sales were still dominated by the Flower-Bird and Bell Tower brands. Flower-Bird was more active than the Bell Tower brand. The opening price was 24.8 yuan, but it fell back to 24.5 yuan due to the sharp decline in the gold market. Later, it was reported that Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel had newly arrived with 10,000 bags of military ship foreign flour, and retail investors slightly released their positions, causing the market to loosen by 20 to 30 cents. However, dealers and wholesalers were holding onto their goods, expecting the news of the Ningbo bond issuance to be positive, which caused buying and selling to become abnormal. Because the miscellaneous grain market only trades for one day, all parties are preparing to close, and the market has seen few changes.</p>
<p>Foreign flour continues to arrive in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Guisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai on the 19th, bringing not only a large amount of foreign rice but also 5,000 bags of flour from Hong Kong. Also, Taikoo Company's Hubei Wheel arrived in port yesterday, bringing 1,500 bags of flour. (Zu)</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat transactions were even quieter. Because the end of the year is approaching, factories are about to stop working, and both Japanese and Chinese factories have become lazy in their purchases. While the amount of goods in stock is low, holders of goods are waiting to hold onto them until the market improves before selling. Therefore, the market is virtually stagnant.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Market Prospects More Difficult</h3>
<p>In the past two days, New York and Yokohama have had no markets. The local "Commodity Inspection Bureau" is still suspending the inspection of various raw silks, so it is difficult to start trading. Currently, the few raw silks that can be exported are obtained by purchasing export licenses at a price of 250 yuan (per package) in an undisclosed manner. Most silk merchants urgently need cash for the lunar New Year, so they can only resort to this high price to sell. However, the domestic raw silk market price will therefore tend to fall further. Therefore, it is increasingly difficult to look forward to the future of raw silk.</p>
<h3>Textiles Cloth Prices Drop with Yarn</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: First rose and then fell. Because it was rumored that the United States would freeze the deposits of Axis countries, the yarn market plummeted, and cloth prices immediately softened. Many sellers competed to sell off their goods, and the market was in chaos. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fabrics fell by 25 to 50 cents per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth was average. The prices of fine yarn and linen fabrics for spring wear remained firm. About 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. The Wen Yong gang bought nearly 100 pieces of No. 190 Shilin bleached cloth and fine cloth. The Guangdong-Fujian gang bought more than 200 pieces of government satin and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, retail investors sold off their goods, and the market gradually softened. The opening price for Longtou fine cloth was 40 yuan, and the lowest price in the later market was as low as 45 yuan. However, because the industry's sentiment was stable, the closing price rebounded to 45.3 yuan. Sijunzi Serge was 1.26375 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, there were 11 pieces of textiles shipped to Xiamen, 340 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, and 40 pieces shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market softened due to the loosening of the exchange rate. The association's marked plate spot price for No. 24 crude white sugar was flat at first and then fell. Foreign warehouse goods were 82.5 yuan, 82 yuan, 81 yuan, 81.7 yuan, down 1 yuan. The February 10th order was good at first, up 20 cents to 83.4 yuan, then fell to 82 yuan, and the lowest was 81.4 yuan, then rebounded to 82.4 yuan, up 8 cents. Dutch red sugar was 66.5 yuan to 66 yuan, down 1 yuan. Taikoo auto white sugar was down 40 to 50 cents, B Mark was 82.5 yuan to 82 yuan, DY Mark was 80 yuan to 79.5 yuan, HX Mark was 79.9 yuan to 79.5 yuan, and the rest lacked transactions.</p>

<h3>US Dollar Exchange Rate Lengthened Again Yesterday, Legal Tender Value More Firm, All Industries Understood the Greater Good, Refused to Accept Miscellaneous Banknotes, Foreign Banks Expressed Consistent Steps</h3>
<p>Since China abolished the tael and changed to the yuan in 1933, establishing the silver standard, it implemented the legal tender system in November 1935, establishing the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, concentrating silver and storing it in different regions. After that, China's currency was no longer affected by fluctuations in world silver prices, and not only did the economy flourish, but it could also cope with unexpected events. After the war, due to the effectiveness of the legal tender policy, social finance was able to operate flexibly and stably as usual. Regarding the issuance of legal tender, a prudent policy has always been adopted. Before the war, the amount issued was too small. Not only were people in remote areas suffering from insufficient funds, but there was also a sense of currency contraction in the markets of the interior. After the war, construction in various places progressed rapidly, and the need for currency was even greater. The number of issues has increased considerably, but does not exceed the saturation point, and the cash reserves are still sufficient, above those of other countries, so it is deeply supported by Chinese and foreigners. All transactions are mainly in legal tender.</p>
<p>US Dollar Exchange Rate Lengthened Legal Tender Firm</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that this morning (20th), Washington telegrammed that the US President will sign an order freezing the funds of aggressor countries or countries that have been invaded in the United States. The Shanghai exchange market was surprised by this telegram. The text is brief and does not clarify whether the Shanghai banks' deposits in the United States will also be frozen, but only the possibility that the United States will freeze these funds has caused dollar speculators here to release large amounts, causing legal tender to become firmer. Because Ningbo's "Central Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" opened this morning, the opening US dollar exchange rate of 5.28125, that is, 18.93 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to one US dollar, was reduced by 0.03125 compared with the closing price last Saturday. However, after the telegram of the freeze on funds arrived, a large number of US dollars were sold off, causing the US dollar exchange rate to lengthen to 5.5625, that is, one US dollar was legally 17.97 yuan. By noon, the market was calm. The closing US dollar exchange rate was 5.5, that is, one US dollar was legally 18.18 yuan. As the currency was firm, stocks and commodities were affected and fell. However, the Public Enterprise Office was still very calm.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ningbo Bank Branch Opening</p>
<p>The "Reserve Bank" Shanghai Branch opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at 15 The Bund, the former site of the Central Bank, under strict security by detectives. Prior to the event, the "President" and "Vice President" came forward to invite people from all walks of life to attend the ceremony. Attendees were required to present their invitations to enter the venue, sign in, and hand in their invitations to receive a notebook. However, members of the Silver Money Industry Association and various industry associations unanimously refused to participate, and those who attended the ceremony were all Ningbo personnel and Japanese nationals. X Yesterday, someone went to inspect and saw more than 200 "employees" who had no public affairs to handle. Although they were divided into more than a dozen departments such as "Exchange" and "Deposit", the organization seemed very large, but because no one patronized, it was extremely deserted.</p>
<p>Adhering to the Original Intention Refusing to Accept</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Silver Money Industry and various industry associations received orders from the Ministry of Finance to refuse to accept and use miscellaneous banknotes that have not been approved for issuance, all industries, including factories, companies, and firms, have decided to adhere to their original intention and refuse to accept and use them, and will not have any relationship with them. Therefore, in business, although these miscellaneous banknotes have been issued, it is difficult to circulate them in the concessions. The so-called claim that they can be exchanged for legal tender without restriction, and that they can purchase foreign exchange without restriction, is aimed at inducing the general public to accept and use them, but the citizens of the two concessions are deeply aware of the greater good and are determined to strictly adhere to their position and refuse to accept them uniformly. For all transactions, they mainly use China's only legal tender. This is also the case for merchants from various friendly countries in Shanghai, who have always expressed their support for legal tender.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Consistent Steps</p>
<p>Foreign banks such as HSBC and Mercantile of British merchants, and Citibank of American merchants, have decided to take consistent steps to refuse to accept the miscellaneous banknotes issued by the "Reserve Bank". At the same time, the commercial firms of various friendly countries have decided to take the same steps as the banks. It is rumored that the "Bank" that issued the miscellaneous banknotes attempted to open accounts with banks in various friendly countries, but this has been rejected by banks in various friendly countries. They believe that China's legal tender is the only Chinese currency, and that it is well-prepared and has a clear reputation. The issuance and reserve situation is announced periodically by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, which is well known to people from various friendly countries, so they express their support.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Busy with Collections and Settlements Guard Protection Lunar New Year Firecrackers Still Strictly Prohibited to Avoid Affecting Public Safety</h3>
<p>The lunar New Year is approaching, and preparations for the final closure are underway. Collections and settlements have been quite busy in recent days. In order to prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to act rashly, the police authorities of the two concessions have stepped up security and taken necessary measures within the borders. The central commercial areas and the vicinity of various banks have been assigned additional Chinese and Western detectives to guard and protect them. On the border roads, the Public Works Department has newly set up wire mesh barriers, three or four at each location, to facilitate blockades or searches when necessary. In addition, armed patrols composed of Chinese and Western police detectives are patrolling, selectively inspecting pedestrians and vehicles on traffic arteries. The White Russian team patrol cars, which were recently handed over to the police department, also began patrolling from yesterday (20th). In the French Concession, French defense forces carrying rifles and hand-held machine guns are assisting in maintaining public safety. In addition, at the time of the lunar New Year, the police department strictly prohibits the lighting of firecrackers by the people for religious ceremonies, in order to avoid affecting public safety.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Executed Yesterday Newly Set Price Limits</h3>
<p>The re-evaluated new price limits for 15 kinds of foreign rice have been publicly announced and strictly enforced in the market since yesterday morning. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, the prices of foreign rice at each stall fell into the newly set price limits uniformly, and the market was stable and quiet, with abundant spot goods. The rice and grain industry participated in the city's public rice warehouse, and jointly recognized the storage of 30,000 bags of rice, which has now been allocated separately. The bean and rice industry accounted for 17,000 bags, the rice shop industry accounted for 5,000 bags, the miscellaneous flour industry, the Chaozhou sugar and miscellaneous goods gang accounted for 2,500 bags, the Guangdong gang Shenshoutang accounted for 2,500 bags, the Zhenjiang gang and Yuantang accounted for 1,500 bags, and the Hankou gang Zhichengtang accounted for 1,500 bags. They are currently actively raising funds to pay, and it is heard that the first installment will be paid by tomorrow (22nd), with half of the amount to be paid, and the second installment will be paid on February 10th, with the remaining half to be paid. The People's Food Regulation Association's tribute rice of 8,718 bags has begun to be unloaded and transported to the Maotai Foreign Company warehouse on Parker Road for temporary storage. Subscribers will pay the remaining amount from tomorrow and exchange the delivery order, so as to hold the order to the warehouse for delivery. However, the remaining amount must be paid within three days. The rice market will be closed from the 23rd.</p>
<h3>French Overseas Fundraising for Donations</h3>
<p>In order to help French people who are suffering from the war, the French overseas community held a charity sale in December last year, raising a total net income of 44,265.05 national currency, which has been remitted to France for the French Red Cross to coordinate and distribute.</p>

<h3>Nazi Overseas Chinese Association Revisits Land Tax Recommendations British Overseas Chinese Suggest Alternative Methods for Own Land The Municipal General Donation Increase Will Be Opposed</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that it has been learned that when the overseas Chinese taxpayers of the Public Concession hold a special meeting at the Racecourse on Thursday (23rd), the British overseas Chinese taxpayers will propose a suggestion to re-evaluate the tax rates on the own land and undeveloped land of the landlords in the concession, so as to reduce the tax burden on small taxpayers.</p>
<p>Own Land Property Tax Increase 14%</p>
<p>It is found that the current tax on own land property of landlords in the Public Concession is still about 1.3 yuan per square foot. The suggestion to be submitted to the special meeting of taxpayers is to authorize the Public Works Department to levy an additional tax of 40% on the current evaluation of the own land property of landlords, and it will be implemented from the beginning of this year. This additional tax is a temporary measure, pending the committee that is currently studying land price issues to completely re-evaluate the value of land property in the concession.</p>
<p>Tax on Vacant Land Seems to Be Increased</p>
<p>The suggestion also proposes that while adding an additional tax of 14% to the own land property of landlords, the tax increase on leased land property should be limited to 40% higher than the tax rate in 1939. In addition, the suggestion proposes that the Public Works Department be authorized to collect a large amount of additional tax on undeveloped land tax, the amount of which shall be determined by the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Small Taxpayers' Burden Reduced</p>
<p>According to one source, if the above suggestions are supported by the taxpayers, the tax burden on small taxpayers will be greatly reduced, and the reasons for this new suggestion are very sufficient, because the price currently assessed for the own land property of landlords is still based on the price value in 1937, while the municipal general donation has increased sharply from 14% in 1937 to 27%, and the Public Works Department intends to increase it to 40%. If this point is approved by the overseas Chinese taxpayers on Thursday, it will be implemented immediately.

<h3>Labor-Management Disputes in Various Industries Resolved Successively Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Clothing Industry Settles Terms and Resumes Operations; Barbers Sign Resumption Conditions Yesterday. As the end of the lunar year approaches and prices soar, business owners in various industries are increasing wages or living allowances for their employees to help them overcome these difficult times. Consequently, labor-management disputes have been resolved one after another. A reporter from the New Voice Society has compiled the following report on the dynamics of labor-management disputes in various industries yesterday:</p>
<p>New Clothing Industry Resumes Operations Yesterday</p>
<p>More than 500 employees from over 150 new clothing stores in the two concession areas of the city jointly submitted requests to their employers on the 13th of this month for increased wages and improved treatment. A strike began on the 17th. Now, both parties have agreed on the following terms: (1) A 30% wage increase; (2) A commission of one cent per dollar; (3) Wages below ten yuan will be raised to ten yuan; (4) In case of employee dismissal, one month's severance pay will be provided; (5) (Omitted). All new clothing stores in the city resumed operations at 5:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Bonus Approved</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Workers' Union issued Circular No. 113, stating that the year-end bonus, which is to be calculated and distributed together with the cost-of-living allowance, has been approved by the General Bureau. However, due to the short timeframe, it cannot be distributed at the same time as salaries but will be supplemented within the lunar year. Furthermore, the rice subsidy for January has been resolved by the Rice Price Evaluation Committee: 73 yuan for married employees and 36.5 yuan for unmarried employees. As for the rice subsidy for December of the 29th year of the Republic for various inland bureaus, the authorities have notified each bureau based on the amounts reported by their respective directors and will distribute the subsidies along with the January salaries.</p>
<p>Commercial Press to Rest for One Hour Today</p>
<p>To prioritize the overall situation and simplify matters, the Labor-Management Dispute Association of the Commercial Press, through resolutions passed by its Executive Supervisory Committee and the general assembly of all group leaders, will no longer insist on opposing the company's good-faith transfer of employees and the current rice subsidy method. However, regarding the dismissal issue, it will maintain its previous stance and has issued a solemn declaration. It will also hold a one-hour work stoppage from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM today to strengthen the declaration's impact and garner sympathy and attention from the company and the public. The association earnestly hopes that the company will promptly retract its order to dismiss employees.</p>
<p>Negotiations at the International Hotel Yesterday</p>
<p>All waiters and servants at the International Hotel at 164 Jing'an Temple Road in the city presented terms to the management, requesting improved treatment and increased cost-of-living allowances. Representatives from both labor and management held negotiations starting at 3:00 PM yesterday. The management representatives provided a detailed report on the hotel's operations and revenue, while the labor representatives expressed their grievances and repeatedly pleaded for the management to accept their requests. The two sides generally agreed, but as of the time of the reporter's dispatch, no resolution had been reached. Negotiations are expected to continue today.</p>
<p>Barbers Sign Labor-Management Agreement</p>
<p>Barbers throughout the city had already resumed work, awaiting the negotiated terms. Details were reported in previous issues. It is understood that the labor unrest in the industry has been resolved satisfactorily. The terms proposed by the labor side were formally signed by representatives from both labor and management yesterday afternoon. The contents of the terms are as follows: (1) For those splitting profits on a 4/6 basis, business hours are from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM; for those splitting profits on a 3/5 basis, business hours are from 8:30 AM to 7:00 PM; workers cannot be dismissed without cause; (2) All miscellaneous expenses in the shop are the responsibility of the management; (3) One meal and two servings of congee will be maintained as before; (4) Non-profit-sharing workers will receive a 40% wage increase; those who have already received an increase will still receive an additional 40%; (5) Female barbers will receive an additional subsidy of two yuan; the rest omitted.</p>
<p>Paint Workers</p>
<p>Paint workers previously requested an increase in meal allowances due to the high cost of living, but the request was not granted, leading to a work slowdown, as reported in this newspaper yesterday. It was learned yesterday that the workers had not yet resumed work. However, it is hoped that the management will show compassion so that the slowdown can end soon. The decision to slow down work was purely driven by the need to make a living and has no other background.</p>
<h3>US Court Judge Returns to Shanghai from North China</h3>
<p>Mr. Helmholtz, a judge from the US Court for China in this city, left Shanghai in the middle of last month to hear cases involving American expatriates in North China. It is now learned that Mr. Helmholtz has completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai to resume his work. He is scheduled to give a lecture on legal issues at the West YMCA at 9:00 PM on the 23rd of this month.</p>

<h3>The Flower Market at Year's End</h3>
<p>— Loving the Year's End</p>
<p>The blood-red poinsettias adorn the Gregorian New Year with extraordinary beauty, but in an instant, the Gregorian New Year also seems to fade away with the withering of the poinsettias.</p>
<p>In recent days, just as the winter plums are about to bloom, this is the news coming from the flower market on the isolated island. Otherwise, there would be no way to know that the plum blossoms are about to bloom, because the entire isolated island is filled with people and houses. Plum blossoms also tell us that the Lunar New Year is coming soon. It has been less than a month since we sent off the Gregorian New Year, and now we are preparing to welcome the Lunar New Year, and we are especially excited.</p>
<p>When the plum blossoms bloom, exploring the plum blossoms is such an elegant and romantic event. In previous years, countless "romantic scholars" would be transported on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo routes to Dengwei Gushan to seek out plum blossoms in the snow. However, since the war broke out, people on the isolated island have become birds in a cage, unable to spread their wings. However, I still had the rare "refined interest" of visiting the flower market at the end of the year, squeezing through crowds and "stepping on asphalt roads" in search of plum blossoms.</p>
<p>The initial destination was the area around Cishudalu on Wangping Street, which is the "scenic spot for exploring plum blossoms" once a year. A large screen of wintersweet, nandina, and winter plum had already been formed on a row of walls at the foreign cemetery. This kind of "scenery" occurs once a year, and it always takes place at the end of the year. At this exhibition, which is different from others, I first "explored" a branch of red plum blossoms and saw that they were indeed about to bloom. Although the spirit of the flowers was not very full, the price asked by the villagers was around two or three yuan per bundle. However, single-petal wild plum blossoms were cheaper, while green plum blossoms were much more expensive. This price is truly considerable, especially these days.</p>
<p>There were also many nandina and wintersweet on display. The clusters of bright red berries of the nandina, with their pieces of emerald green leaves, were very lovely. The ones seen at the flower market that were relatively cheaper, with only a few berries and leaves that were not very spirited, still sold for three yuan per plant. If they were more presentable, with two strings of red berries on each plant, they would sell for twenty-two yuan per plant. This price is astonishing. They are truly asking for the moon. However, from villagers who are more reasonable, one yuan could also buy nandina and wintersweet. When buying, one must be careful, or else one will pay a good price and still buy inferior nandina, because some nandina have leaves but no berries, some have berries but no leaves, and some have few berries. So, those clever villagers tie them together to make a perfect nandina plant, and the price can be raised accordingly. This year, the price of nandina is truly "crazy hot," even a rooted nandina plant wouldn't cost this much. In the countryside, even giving it away might not be welcomed by many people. Nandina and wintersweet are truly a match made in heaven. "Flowering" and "berry turning red" both happen at the same time. Green leaves with red berries, plus the yellow flowers as a contrast, is so moving!</p>
<p>Wintersweet with a plain heart and a chime-shaped mouth is the best. The so-called plain heart means that the color of the flower heart and the petals is the same; usually, the heart is red. Therefore, wintersweet with a plain heart is more valuable, and the fragrance is also the richest. The so-called chime-shaped mouth means that the petals are round and slightly curled, and the petals are arranged very closely, like the mouth of a chime. If it is not a wintersweet with a plain heart and a chime-shaped mouth, the fragrance will be weak, commonly known as "fly" wintersweet, and its price is much lower. However, what can be seen in the flower market are mostly wintersweet with a plain heart, but those with a chime-shaped mouth are rare, which is truly a pity. However, this year's price is not cheap either. A wintersweet plant about four or five feet tall sells for eight yuan, and a nandina plant costs thirty yuan, which is truly a rare miracle. I was frightened by this price and went to the National Flower Market at Cishudalu.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the market, many narcissus flowers are displayed. Ordinary people always think that double-petal narcissus flowers are better, but to be frank, double-petal narcissus flowers are not the truly old-fashioned narcissus flowers, while single-petal narcissus flowers are the old-fashioned narcissus flowers, divided into crab claw and straight stem types. Crab claw types are sculpted artificially, so the price is more expensive, about one yuan per plant, while straight stem types can be bought for about eighty cents.</p>
<p>Stepping into the market, there were indeed many potted plum blossoms, about a thousand pots, mostly red and green plum blossoms in screen form. There were also potted plum blossom bonsai, but none of them suited my taste. There were twenty or thirty pots of split plum tree stumps that looked like plum blossoms inserted into a piece of firewood. They could actually bloom and grow green leaves in the future, but from a plant physiology perspective, it is truly unexplainable. Squeezing into the gardening section of the National Products Company, it is said to be handled by Yin Xianglin, a flower industry tycoon. Most of them are potted plum blossoms. One pot of big red plum blossoms is titled "Lone Crane," and one pot of jade butterfly plum blossoms is titled "Deer Plum." Looking at their shapes, they are very wonderful. Among them, a large pot of "Three Friends of Winter" (pine, bamboo, and plum) is the most meaningful and the most beautifully arranged. Finally, squeezing out of the National Products Company, I took the tram to the Baile Bazaar.</p>
<p>The first thing I saw was the old plum tree stump arranged by Ma Shaotang of Huaxing Garden, which was very old and said to have been transported from Dengwei Mountain in Suzhou. Both red and green plum blossoms were present, and the flowers were very lush. Going further in was Xu Shengchang Pottery Shop, said to be the authority in the pottery industry in Shanghai. Most of the pots used for potted plum blossoms on the isolated island this year were sold by him. He also sold potted plum blossoms and goldfish. Finally, what caught my eye was Kong Zhiqing's potted plum blossoms, which also best suited my taste. The raw materials he used to arrange the potted plum blossoms were the same, but the arrangement method had undergone an artistic refinement, and it was, after all, different from the bonsai arranged by ordinary gardeners. He had more than a hundred pots of plum blossoms on display. Although it cannot be said that every pot was a masterpiece, at least it can be said that there were more pots that were pleasing to the eye, and among them, the "Plum Blossom Study" pot was the most poetic and picturesque. I will briefly describe the arrangement: In a pair of oval pots, five red plum blossoms were planted, matched extraordinarily appropriately. Below were several thatched huts serving as a study, with a winding stream in the middle, separating it into two parts, with a small bridge for passage. It was truly like an ancient book, and it is still on display at the Baile Bazaar. As the sun set, I finally embarked on my journey home. This year's plum blossom exploration can be considered to have been carried out in this way. Speaking of it, it is truly a bit pitiful. However, I hope that next year I can truly climb Dengwei Mountain to seek out plum blossoms in the snow and be a truly refined person. That would be indescribably joyful.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Dong Yu Shot and Killed Yesterday; Young Assassin Lies in Wait at Lane Entrance and Opens Fire; Bullet Hits Head and Death Occurs Before Reaching Hospital</h3>
<p>At around 10:15 AM yesterday, a shooting occurred suddenly at the entrance of the Tailasixin Village, Tailasitu Road in the French Concession. The person shot and killed was lawyer Dong Yu. He was shot twice in the head on the spot and died. The shooter took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The following is an investigation of the details:</p>
<p>Ambush at Lane Entrance</p>
<p>Dong Yu, courtesy name Jingxi, was 45 years old this year and from Wujin. He claimed to be a relative of former Minister of Justice Dong Kang. He had an office on the second floor of 89 Fuzhou Road, No. 221, and lived at No. 2, Tailasixin Village, 188 Tailasitu Road, in the French Concession. At around 10:15 AM yesterday, Dong was riding in his private car No. 602, driven by Wang Genquan from Suzhou. As soon as the car drove out of the lane, a young man lying in wait at the lane entrance saw the car approaching.</p>
<p>Fatally Wounded</p>
<p>He immediately pulled out a pistol and fired three shots at him. Dong, sitting upright in the car, was caught off guard. He was hit twice in the head on the spot, his brains splattered, and he fell onto the car cushion, bleeding profusely and on the verge of death. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the shooter fled with his weapon. The driver, Wang Genquan, seeing that his master had been attacked, quickly stopped the engine and rushed back to the residence to report to Dong's wife, Ms. Gong (43 years old), and called the Lujiawan Police Station. The police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene in patrol cars.</p>
<p>Vital Parts Hit</p>
<p>However, the shooter had already vanished. Several empty shell casings were found at the scene of the incident and taken back to the police station for investigation to pursue the culprit. The injured man was accompanied by his wife, Ms. Gong, to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road but died due to the bullets hitting vital parts. Afterwards, Ms. Gong took a car to the house of a relative at No. 19 Lafeide Lane, Lafeide Road, to discuss funeral arrangements. The security guard at the lane saw that the car's glass was shattered and the car was stained with blood, realizing something was amiss, and reported it to the police station by phone. When the police arrived to investigate, they realized it was Dong's private car.</p>
<p>Activities Before Death</p>
<p>It is said that Dong served as a legal advisor to the "Unified Tax Bureau" after the war, receiving a monthly salary of 300 yuan, and often frequented the New Asia Hotel in Hongkou. When the Wenhui Bao newspaper was flourishing, he once joined the newspaper through the introduction of the newspaper's editor, Ke Ming. The night before, Dong was playing mahjong with friends at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club until dusk before returning home in low spirits.</p>
<h3>Taji Maru Departs Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>78 Boxes of Relief Medicines to be Shipped to Shanghai for Distribution to Disaster Areas. The President Taji Maru, a passenger ship of the American President Lines, arrived from the eastern United States and passed through Kobe, directly heading to Hong Kong and the Philippines on the 5th of this month. It is now on its return trip from the Philippines, passing through Hong Kong and arriving in Shanghai, scheduled to arrive at the port at 6:00 PM today. It is scheduled to dock at buoys 12 and 13. Passengers will board small boats prepared by the company and disembark at the New Customs Wharf at 7:30 PM today. The passenger ship will stay in Shanghai for one day and night and depart from Shanghai for Kobe at 6:30 PM tomorrow (the 22nd), heading to Los Angeles via San Francisco. The last small boat to pick up passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM tomorrow. There are 159 passengers disembarking from the ship in Shanghai, and 171 passengers traveling to the United States on the original ship. There are also dozens of passengers traveling to the United States from Shanghai on the ship, but the exact number has not yet been announced. A large amount of mail has been transported this time, totaling 419 pieces, including 49 pieces of US Army and Navy mail. In addition, 78 large boxes of medicines from the American Red Cross for Chinese refugees, including various pills and liquid medicines, have also arrived in Shanghai on the ship.</p>
<h3>Cold Wave Moves South; Ice Seen This Morning</h3>
<p>The climate in this city became even colder yesterday. Thin ice was seen before dawn. It was learned from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday that the cause of the cold weather in this city is due to the Siberian cold wave invading the Yangtze River basin from the north, causing a sharp drop in temperature. Before dawn yesterday morning, it dropped to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit below the freezing point (i.e., slightly below -1 degree Celsius). The cold wave is now moving east, but the air pressure has not increased. The same is true in Wuhan in Central China. It is expected that the weather will warm up after the cold wave passes in a few days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council Schedule Holidays</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have stipulated that they will follow the usual practice of taking three days of holidays for the Lunar New Year, namely January 27, 28, and 29, and will suspend all office work. Public affairs will resume from the 30th, and the public has been notified.</p>

<p>At 5:30 PM yesterday evening, an attempted kidnapping occurred on Museum Road in the Public Concession, with bandits opening fire and injuring the intended victim.

When a man in his forties was walking out of the building, he was spotted by the bandits, who approached and attempted to kidnap him. However, the man was very alert. Seeing the situation, he knew he was in danger and shouted and ran away, angering the bandits. One of the bandits pulled out a gun and fired several shots at him, hitting the man twice in the abdomen. He fell to the ground bleeding. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the bandits fled in all directions without a trace. After nearby patrol officers heard the report and arrived, they took the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the injured man was named Zhou Zhijun, 45 years old, from Anhui, and is currently the chairman of Xinhe Yarn Factory. Due to the injuries to vital parts, his life is in danger.</p>

Yesterday (the 19th), another British national, Cole, was robbed. Cole was on Tangshan Road at 1:20 AM yesterday when he was pulled into a public toilet. Two bandits held iron rulers and threatened to strike Cole's head, while three other bandits stripped Cole of his clothes, shoes, and 2.3 yuan in cash and left. When the Hongshan Police Station received the report, they sent detectives to the scene to investigate, but the bandits were nowhere to be found.

<p>The China Press reported that Mao Jianqing, a wealthy businessman in this city, was about to board his private car when leaving his residence on Yuyuan Road at 9:30 AM this morning (the 20th). Suddenly, eight bandits rushed out from the roadside and attempted to kidnap him. The driver quickly abandoned the car and fled. Two Western constables from the Jing'an Temple Police Station happened to be passing by and opened fire twice. The bandits, realizing they had been discovered, fled in panic. Mr. Mao was thus spared from being kidnapped. The Pingming Society also reported that Mao Zhaozhang, in his forties, a senior employee of the Shenxin Yarn Factory in this city, lives at No. 7, Lane 805 (i.e., Jin Yuan), Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai.

<h3>Ministry of Education Promulgates Measures for Seniority Pay Increase for Elementary School Teachers; Counties Should Set Regulations Based on Local Financial Resources; Those Not Registered and Approved Will Not Enjoy the Benefits</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education recently promulgated measures for seniority pay increases for elementary school teachers and distributed them to subordinate units for implementation. Excerpts from the measures are as follows: (1) The educational administrative agencies of each county should make the following regulations based on local financial resources: A. Every two, three, or four years shall be designated as one seniority level; B. The salary increase amount for one seniority level shall be 2, 3, 4, or 5 national currency units. (2) Elementary school teachers who have continuously served at one school for each full seniority level and whose performance is still satisfactory shall be promoted one level and receive a seniority pay increase. (3) Elementary school teachers who have not continuously served at one school shall have their seniority level extended by one year. "For example, for those who have continuously served at one school, three years is considered one level; for those who have not continuously served at one school, four years is considered one level." If there is an interruption in the service period, the seniority level period shall be calculated based on the number of years of continuous service thereafter. However, those who are transferred by the educational administrative agency or who have an interruption due to illness and have not held other paid positions shall still be considered as having continuously served at one school. (4) Elementary school teachers who have received disciplinary actions such as reprimands or demerits during a certain seniority level period shall have their seniority pay increase for that level suspended. However, if they are commended during the same period, it may be restored. (5) Seniority pay increases shall be carried out concurrently with salary increases due to qualifications, positions, and the number of students taught, as stipulated in the regulations on the treatment of elementary school teachers. (6) Elementary school teachers who have not been registered and approved shall not receive seniority pay increases. However, the seniority pay increases they should have received during the registration period shall be supplemented after registration and approval.</p>

<h3>I Want to Repay My Debts</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>I am in debt, heavily in debt.</p>
<p>I haven't borrowed money from anyone, I never gamble, and I certainly don't engage in speculative business. I never harbor any wishful thinking. Yet, I am burdened with a debt, a heavy debt that can never be fully repaid.</p>
<p>When I was growing inside my mother's womb, I had already begun to accrue debts. This debt wasn't left behind by my father; rather, I brought it upon myself. When I was born into this world, I had already been a tenant in my mother's womb for ten months. My mother provided me with that safe, comfortable, warm, and spring-like dwelling without charging me any rent. However, no matter what, I owe my mother ten months' worth of rent. This is the first debt I incurred.</p>
<p>From the first day I came into this world, my mother became my wet nurse and nanny. When I was hungry, she would immediately put her nipple in my mouth. When I cried, she would hold me, rock me, and comfort me. When I was tired, she would naturally sing lullabies. She hardly left my side all day long. Thus, I accumulated another significant debt.</p>
<p>I had food to eat, I had drinks to drink, I had clothes to wear, and I had a house to live in. I was a happy child. Later, my father sent me to school. There, I encountered teachers who tirelessly imparted knowledge, classmates with whom I could learn and improve, and books that broadened my understanding. Consequently, I incurred yet another heavy debt. This time, my creditors were my father, the school, the nation, and society.</p>
<p>I am burdened with a heavy debt, and this debt constantly weighs on my mind. Although my creditors have never demanded repayment from me, I feel burdened, overwhelmed. On one hand, I am grateful to the creditors who extended credit to me. On the other hand, I feel the immense expectations that the creditors have for me. I sense a strong pressure. Although I can't fully repay this debt, I must repay it.</p>
<p>I want to repay my debts. I want to settle this debt that can never be fully settled. This is not only my obligation but also my responsibility.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>When I Lift a Bowl of Thin Porridge</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>Every time I lift a bowl of rice, preparing to bring the thin porridge to my lips, my hands and lips tremble uncontrollably; the trepidation in my heart rises like the steam from the porridge. Tears also flow freely.</p>
<p>My elderly father shattered his rice bowl when the war began; in the years since, his expression has grown even more somber, and his mood has become heavier. How can an elderly person endure the successive blows of worry? The white patches in his hair are striking, and his body has gradually thinned, with his cheeks protruding alarmingly; his deeply sunken eyes stare blankly at us every day. Sometimes, he takes out his yellowish handkerchief, the same color as his face, and wipes his eyelids; seemingly deep in thought, yet also seemingly sobbing.</p>
<p>We are even more deeply ashamed of our mother's burden. On one hand, she has to try to comfort our father, who seems to have lost his soul. On the other hand, she has to cherish and worry about our actions. Her repeated efforts to alleviate the anxiety weighing heavily on her father's mind" always fail to yield the slightest results.</p>
<p>"Why don't you go out for a walk to clear your head?" she says to my father in a soft, gentle voice, as if begging.</p>
<p>"...Father's head, which was drooping, only lifted slightly."</p>
<p>There is not even a slightest hint of a further movement. Mother can only lower her head, and stitch on the white paper books. Her work made her back bent and scattered her eyes. Sometimes I went to her and said: "Mom, rest a bit!" She glanced at me with a start, and her eyes showed hesitation, her malnourished cheeks stroked my hair and said: "Son, are you back?" I told her after, and I had not been captured.</p>
<p>"Son, you should rest! You are young and should not suffer so much." As soon as I turned around, she immediately began sewing more tightly. Her hands worked tirelessly, from early morning until evening, and from evening until after we were all fast asleep. She was still sewing books under the lamp all night. What her hands earned supported our lives, but it also robbed her of everything.</p>
<p>When I brought this bowl of thin porridge, bought with the money of blood and sweat, to my mouth, my nerves couldn't help but tremble. I seemed to see my father's sorrowful face, my mother's hunched over situation of my mother working, as the porridge steamed, my tears also rolled down.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Qingou</p>
<p>Shaowen shifted his body slightly and said with great interest:</p>
<p>"He originally had a talent for drawing. The next day when I went again, he had already drawn a picture according to what I had said. Although it was only a begonia leaf and a few caterpillars, it was very well-drawn, and he also wrote four black characters 'Shocking to the Eye' in the corner. Because I felt it was very rare, I really praised him a few words, and I even specially gave him a mirror frame so that he could hang up that painting."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he paused slightly, and casually picked up the teacup in front of him, but did not drink.</p>
<p>"Last month, his boss Zhao Si repeatedly came to ask him to join the troupe. Because his mother's mourning period had ended, he no longer refused, but he discussed with me, wanting to change the three characters 'Wu Yuqin' because it sounded too much like a woman's name. I thought for a long time for him, but I couldn't think of any good names. Later, I had a moment of inspiration and thought of the three characters 'Autumn Begonia'. Although it still had a bit of a feminine feel, it still had some meaning. When he heard me say that, he immediately agreed. Our third uncle also knew about it, and he also said that these three characters sounded very resonant, and they were indeed better than 'Wu Yuqin'. Anyway, he had already finished his training, so he could change his name if he wanted to, and who could stop him?"</p>
<p>The thin and long Pingju master, Mr. Yu Zhongqian, nodded his head.</p>
<p>"That's right, the troupe can't control the students who have finished their training, who can change their stage names," he continued, immediately putting on a very smug expression, "I remember thirty-one years ago, Ma Fengyun had just finished his training at Fengming Troupe, and he didn't like that name either, so his brother changed it for him to Ma Yufeng. The first day he changed his name and performed was 'Thirteen Sisters', with Zhang Jinfeng as Little Bao Fen, Gao Shoulin's son, Liu Baokui's Deng Jiugong, Zhou Fu..."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was just about to blow his own horn when the young man in the suit abruptly pointed out a flaw.</p>
<p>The Fervent Outlook on Life (30)</p>
<p>The amount of strength I use in my struggles depends on the degree of adversity. Small adversity requires little effort, and large adversity requires great effort. I can control adversity; adversity cannot control me. Adversity should fear me; I do not fear adversity!</p>

<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>— Ze Zhi</p>
<p>The two hands of the clock formed a thirty-degree angle, it was already one o'clock! But my stomach hasn't had my lunch today, hungry and snarling, going back to my house, the food is already cold, so it is better to go out and buy snacks! As soon as I made up my mind, I put on my jacket and went out!</p>
<p>I went around the road, and the things I liked were too expensive, so I bought two pieces of cake and wanted to return. A strange hand suddenly reached into my arms. A pack of cakes was snatched away and ran away. Damn it! Can my things be snatched by you? Really, they can't rob my things! In a few steps, I had already caught up with him, and he was already in my hands. He was very sensible and stood there without leaving. Anger burned in my chest, I clenched my fist, raised my arm high, wishing I could beat him to death. But, the pleading smile and look of pity, very unnaturally revealed on his yellowish, filthy, thin face; trembling his lips - meaning to say something, but not a sound came out of his throat, the poor fellow was just trembling, the anger extinguished by a basin of cold water; the tight fist was loosened, and his arms were soft and drooped down. Just when it drooped down, I took back my cake. Looking again at his pitiful appearance, my mind was tangled with messy thoughts, and unconsciously embarked on the way home.</p>
<p>Although my lost lunch has been regained, his already obtained lunch is still lost, just listening to his stomach growling!</p>

<h3>Charlie Chaplin's Humor</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Besides having the name of "Comedy Master" on the silver screen, Charlie Chaplin also has talent in music. The entire dubbing work of the "The Great Dictator" was done by him.</p>
<p>One time, Chaplin held a grand banquet on his birthday, which was his close circle. His servants, cars and secretaries are all invited. At the end of the meal, he sang a famous Italian song. At that time, one of the ladies asked him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhuo, I definitely didn't know you could sing so well."</p>
<p>"I can't sing, I'm just imitating Caruso." (Caruso is a deceased Italian musician)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuo has always maintained a humble attitude in his dealings with others. It can also be said that his current status is due to this.</p>
<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Therefore, her body gradually weakened, like the setting sun, with fewer days of joy, and she was often bedridden. Although Liu Rushi had some disagreements with Muzhai about sacrificing herself for the country, the couple's feelings remained harmonious and unbroken. However, Muzhai often felt guilty towards this beloved concubine who was as beautiful as peach and plum blossoms and as upright as ice and snow. In a certain month of the Bingwu year, Muzhai suddenly fell ill and could not recover, despite medical treatment. During his illness, Liu Rushi diligently served him medicine. When Muzhai was about to pass away, he tightly grasped Liu Rushi's slender hand, sighed deeply, and said in a trembling voice: "Qianyi has failed the late Emperor above and failed you, my beloved, below. I deeply regret not heeding your golden words and sacrificing ourselves together to earn eternal fame. What have I gained now? Just a few more years of survival, but with increasing sins. Today, I regret it too late. I hope you can forgive me. Also, I have always been good at borrowing and have not accumulated wealth. The matter of Huang Yuqi has implicated me and almost ruined our family. After my death, this heavy burden will be left for you to bear, which is even more unfair. Please, for the sake of our past affection, take care of this stinking carcass of mine. I can't worry about anything else." After saying these words, Muzhai died with regret. Liu Rushi cried mournfully, her heart pierced like a knife. She was busy arranging Muzhai's funeral, but before the corpse was even cold, creditors came demanding payment. This was because Muzhai had incurred many debts during his lifetime, and he did not have good relationships with the people in his hometown and clan. Many people were dissatisfied with him. Coincidentally, Muzhai's adopted son was a weak scholar, and the local bullies looked down on him, thinking he was easy to bully and that they could take advantage of him. So, they joined forces, using debt collection as an excuse, and swarmed to the Qian family's gate, shouting loudly, pushing, and insulting. The adopted son was like a scholar meeting soldiers, unable to reason clearly, losing his mind, and not knowing what to do. Seeing this situation, Liu Rushi could not contain her grief and indignation. She said to the adopted son with tears in her eyes, "Don't be afraid, I am here, and I can handle it." (40)</p>
<h3>Maxims for Self-Cultivation (17)</h3>
<p>Looking at your opponent from a subjective standpoint will only make you angrier and angrier, making you feel that the other party is deliberately making things difficult for you, and that you must give them a taste of hardship to vent the anger in your chest. If you stand from an objective standpoint, the other party may not be entirely wrong, and you may not be entirely right. If you stand in the other party's shoes, you will discover many things that can be forgiven.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water"</h3>
<p>In addition to the plays performed by Fudan University students themselves, recently, under the leadership of Huang Jiaxiang, the "Yunhai Drama Society" was organized. It was decided to use Zhang Wanqing's translation of "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water" as their debut performance. (Xu Xiejing's "Business Sutra" from the former Shanghai Drama Society was also adapted from the original work.)</p>
<p>The director is Wu Shuidigang, who is William, and the actors, in addition to all the members of the society, also include special guest stars Liu Qiong, Shu Shi, Zhou Qi, Huang He, Sima Yingcai, Yin Xiucen, Shangguan Yunzhu, Shen Hao, Yan Fei, Vera, and Zhang Fan. For an amateur drama society to have such power, besides last year's "Hero of the Sea" by the Xin Yi Drama Society, this "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water" can be considered another one. The play is now mature in rehearsals and is scheduled to be staged at the Carlton starting on the 13th.</p>
