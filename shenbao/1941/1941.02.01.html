<h3>今後之工商界</h3>
<p>上海工商百業胥於欣欣有喜色之中，渡過國難期間第四總結賬，此乃崎形發展中之收穫，不可諱也。世變方殷，來軫方遒，未來之百業趨勢誠難斷言，但就大體觀察，既得覘知其正常之前途亦必將於艱危之中獲致光明。蓋經濟之盈虛為決定戰爭勝敗之重要因素，戰爭之勝利為促進百業繁榮之重要動力，而上海之一切實隨中國國運以轉移；中國抗建之最後成就固無待贅言，而中國經濟之左右逢源則已見於今茲。蓋如蘇聯，自始迄今，物質之援華不輟。又如英國，雖孤軍苦戰，然其朝野均已曉然於與華提携之為兩利。又如美國，欲策太平洋之安全，解脫西顧之隱憂，自必將援英與援華等量齊觀；而蔣委員長則謂美國倘欲避免牽入遠東漩渦，僅須以援英之一半援華；是以純從美國之利害得失而權衡之，可以斷言於今日而後，美國自必對華作財政上之大量援助。更證以羅斯福總統所派來華之代表，不為軍事外交人員，而為饒有財政經濟統計學識，尤其對於「美國貨幣之供應及統制」有著作之古利博士，此其意義與使命蓋益顯見。攷美國之對華放款，截至本年初為止，約計為美金二萬四千萬元。大部分係由進口銀行經手，並不包括美財部穩定中國貨幣借款美金五千萬元在內；而原則早已確定之貨幣借款，遲遲未簽訂，非美國對於維持中國法幣之本身有所遲疑，却正為中國法幣計之，必須杜防種種可能之流弊，而後所援獲致實益，自有待鄭重考慮者在焉。誠以中國之貨幣問題非極簡單，因與英國商業具有悠久之歷史，而於改行法幣之際，又與英鎊發生密切之關係，故美國如對華貨幣作有力之搘持以與英國相約採取同樣步調為事半而功倍。目前之英國，雖自顧不遑，乞助於美，但對於遠東貿易舊有之地位，自不願輕易放棄。終必聯合屬地，結合美國，對華作盡力之援助。由此觀之，謂中國經濟有其優越而偉大之環境，有其至可樂觀之條件，洵非誇張之談也。</p>
<p>雖然，大體樂觀之義，非即無憂無慮之謂也。試以法幣一端而論，謀所以裨益之者，顧慮孔多：第一，投鼠忌器，必須兼顧英美商人貿易上之便利；第二，上海市塲雖仍集中於公共租界一隅之內，然而內在之齮齕爭攘，未易消弭；三則南洋方面一朝濤浪驟緊，則對於上海英美商人之地位，能否保持目前之狀態，疑問重重；四則蟄處於備辦內數百萬中國居民所衣所食所取資，幾乎無一不與外匯發生聯鎖，故外匯之獲取，以及匯價無論其為長為短，必與一般生活上發生絕大變動，自在必須顧及。因此之故，雖以英美合力，然求所以裨益法幣而有利無弊者，殊非輕而易舉者也。抑法幣之匯市如何，無關法幣之深厚基礎；一隅之得失如何，無關全局之國際大計；故匯市之升降，並非英美對華態度之風雨表。由大體之極可樂觀，知前途之必趨光明；但在光明實現前之一霎那，遭遇狂風暴雨，感覺昏天黒地，則皆在意中；但願工商辦咬緊牙關，謹慎營業，毋再投機居奇，善自保持兩三年來之盈利，先渡當前可能之難關，然後放大眼光，以所盈為憑藉，圖謀戰勝後之正常發展，斯實計至善也。</p>

<p>國際軼聞（二）</p>
<h3>日德義同盟的秘密</h3>
<p>這是美國的「日本通」富萊休所作「未被檢查報吿」之第三篇，原文亦載紐的Herald　Tribune，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>日本外相松岡某次在東原接見各國新聞記者，對他們說，美國如果進攻德國，日本爲實踐其「光榮的義務」，自當與美國一戰，但僅以美國首先開　爲限。這種談話洩露了去年九月德義日三角同盟的一個秘密。</p>
<p>德義日三角同盟條的原以第三條爲重心，該條規定，締的各國，倘被未參加現行歐戰或中日戰爭的一國所攻擊，則當在政治經濟軍事上互相援助。當時東京方面曾謠傳，盟的另有一種附加保留性質的條款，用以確定以國業已「被攻擊」，從而決定參戰與否。但把松岡的談話分析起來，可知並無這種條款存在，將來德國與美國萬一發生戰爭，日本當先確定德國是否先被美國攻擊，然後再決定日本是否應參加戰爭。</p>
<p>從盟的成立的時候起，各簽字國志在對付美國，從未嚴重的注意到應用在歐洲方面。它們爲避免提及美國名字起見，特別標明「未參加現行歐戰或中日戰爭的一國。」此外並在第五條聲明與蘇聯無關，把蘇聯也脫淸了。</p>
<p>義大利進攻希臘，可說是這個盟的的初次試金石。這次微妙的事件使東京噤若寒蟬，日本顯然沒有預料這個盟的應用到歐洲方面。依照盟約第三條，首須確定義大利是吾已被希臘攻擊，藉以決定日本應否援助義大利同盟國。去年十月廿八日，義希戰事爆發，這天日本各晨報紛紛注意到日本對於三國盟的的義務，但到晚報出版，已無隻字道及日本這種義務了。</p>
<p>日本政府對於此一事件，窘態畢露，感到無從措手之苦。假使確定義大利是侵略國，從此結怨一個盟國，以後休想請求她援助。反之，假使確定希臘「攻擊」義國，那麼不得不依照條的，在政治經濟軍事三方面援助義國。結果只好默不出聲，希臘駐日公使巴里蒂斯原已準備一接到逐客令，便立即下旗歸國，日本政府却許其繼續留任，希臘商船也准許繼續在日本各口岸寄椗。</p>
<p>日本許多人對於這種同盟，自始即表示不滿，但因天皇在盟的成立的時候，曾頒發詔書，表示「欣慰」。在日本史上，詔書涉及外交事務，絕無僅有，自從七年前日本脫離國際聯盟以來，還是第一次，一般國民焉敢公然疵議，但他們却都關切地問着，日木甘冒不諱，與美國齟齬，究竟有何益處</p>
<p>日人對於這個問題，始終沒有獲得滿意的答復。但鑒於盟的剛成立時遠東局勢的發展，允其是日本向法屬越南推進一事，顯示出該的不可知的要素，使人相信其內幕範圍的廣大，來日自可分曉。</p>
<p>東京外交觀察家都相信，德方已向日本提供下列的交換條件：</p>
<p>（一）日本在法屬越南可得一據點。</p>
<p>（二）上海法租界得於必要時遵照維希政府命令，移交日本</p>
<p>（三）德國代表蘇聯向日本保證，日本茍與美國在太平洋發生戰爭，蘇聯可保守中立。</p>
<p>（四）德國保證對於荷屬東印度「並不關切」，藉此暗示日本放心推行南進政策。</p>
<p>查日本加入三角同盟一事，自一九三六年十一月日德反共條的成立時起，歷屆內閣都曾加以辯論，直至一九四〇年九月十九日，始在御前會議中決定。御前會議開會時，天皇聞曾一反照樣核准的往例，表示不滿，海軍首腦也表示異議，終因軍部堅持之故而成立。御前會議閉幕後三日，日本即向越南推進了。</p>
<p>日本事先曾派西原少將率領軍事代表團前往越南，表面上是担任監視工作，防止軍械軍需經由越南運入中國，實際却是向河內法國當局提出條件，並限於九月二十二日晚間以前答覆。法方在威脅之下，就在是日午後四時三十分與日方簽訂協定。西原即派遣軍官一名前往諒山，通知華南日軍總司令安藤中將，謂協定業已成立，規定日本六千名可經由海防開入越南，華南部隊暫勿調動。安藤認爲與他無關，當晚即令所部從同登地方開入越南，因與法軍發生衝突。</p>
<p>西原聽得安藤部隊開動的消息，連忙另派軍官一名，趁飛機趕到諒山，企圖阻止他的部隊前進。這位軍官坐了汽車，上懸白旗，向日軍近面駛去，日兵見是本國軍官，都蠭集攏來，並把西原的意思轉吿該區指揮官，那知這位指揮官聲稱本人只聽安藤中將命令，不知其他，飭令所部繼續推進。法國當局於是急電駐日大使亨利，飭向日本外務省交涉，日方就用皇命一道，直達安藤，命其停止前進，交還所獲法國軍械，埋葬法方陣亡士兵。安藤至此始乃運命，飭令所部二千人從海防撤退，其中一部份聞係調往海南島，其餘調往台灣，安藤也被召回東京，解除軍權，在參踩本部掛一閑差。</p>
<p>但上述一事並不足以證明日本向越南推進，非出預定計劃。日本政府所以阻制安藤前進的原故，大半是由於維希政府背後有着德國壓力呢。</p>
<p>除此而外，法國戰敗之後，日本曾要求越南當局准許日本飛機經由越南飛往泰國。法方不得不表示接受，但是後來發覺法德停戰協定曾規定禁止外國飛機經過越南，便再通知日本打消原議。日方對於法國出爾反爾，頗爲震怒，結果終算山維希政府與德國商得同意，仍舊准許日機飛過越南。</p>
<p>日本最後加入三角同盟，希特勒的特使史泰美居功不小。他在去年四月九月二次到日左，行動很爲詭秘，直到盟的成立，各報放纔揭載他的名字和使命。聽說此人道出莫斯科時，蘇聯當局曾向他保證，日美如果在太平洋開戰，蘇聯當保守中立。</p>
<p>至於德國對於荷屬東印度的態度，自去年五月間，已表示「並不關切」，此際該國仍在鼓勵日本南進政策，以謀把美的國的注意力，從歐洲移轉到亞洲，而實現松岡所謂三角同盟志在「的束美國參加歐戰」的目的。</p>

<p>小麥昨無開展、假期中杜麥供源依然枯乏、滬市租界存底僅二千餘包、執貨者莫不居奇扳佾、惟洋粉紅盤市價平庸、各廠在新年中進胃亦屬怠懈、故麥市僅有叫盤、而乏正式交易、</p>

<h3>現棉情況仍堅</h3>
<p>－長織維者最歡迎－</p>
<p>現棉情况稍見堅昂、因紗市尙穩定、所以人心帶佳、不過廠方需要未見十分發展也、印度棉價塊角趨鬆、向海外購訂依然廉宜、惟細紗原料較少、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、先因現貨商頻頻購買、繼之又因棉布交易良好、故市况趨於堅定、結果收盤價格較之上日的漲四五磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、亦因紗廠略有購進、以及少數空頭抵補、故昨日連同預測再高三羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、咋日紅盤開出雖僅成交六百餘包、但以各方對於原棉之採購頗具誠意、尤以長絲毛者最爲廠方歡迎、故預下棉市之將來仍樂觀無疑也、</p>

<p>東布昨白貨龍頭細布、晨開四十五元九角、嗣以買進多而賣出少、至午收盤爲四十六元四角、午後無市、惟人氣高昂、貨盤緊俏、有繼續升騰之勢、色貨四君子嗶嘰開盤時、成交價爲一元二角八分、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜瓜子紅盤獨漲</h3>
<p>上屆北貨業各行均有盈餘、惟貨價大都已達高峯、爲慎重計、對於存貨結價較低、俾少風險、昨日首市金菜瓜子紅黑棗均有做開、計頂莊菜開一百六十元、漲二十元、仰花菜一百四十元、宿遷菜一百三十二元至一百三十元、普通衆興菜一百二十六元、共成交二百十二包、黑瓜子開濟魁子一百十八元、濟中子一百十四元、泰魁子一百十元、泰與子一百〇二元、明光子高九十六元、中九十二元、次八十八元、共四百包弱、濟陽統手黑棗六十包、六十七元、長紅棗二十包、二十六元、</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟開盤報漲</h3>
<p>香烟以廠方行盤漲價、因原料飛漲、故各廠改訂新價、永泰和公司經理老刀牌九百二十元、品海牌八百七十元、哈德門八百七十元、小仙女牌六百七十元、五華牌六百七十元、莊成公司小美麗牌九百二十元、金鼠牌九百二十元、均照舊價漲起二十元、本埠同業出貨每五萬枝、另加難民捐一元、</p>

<p>納稅日人常會務委員會、於三十日午後一時在日人總會開會、討論四小時許、仍未正式決定納稅日人是吾出席二月五日之公共租界納稅外僑特別大會、據同盟社消息、該常委會爲對此問題獲得最後決議起見、昨日午後一致同意於星期六（即今日）召開納稅日人大會、據悉納稅日人會常委大多數贊成納稅日人不參加定二月五日在跑馬廳舉行之大會、如果納稅日人決計不出席此大會、則納稅日人會將派員到會旁觀、按上海各馬路日人聯合會已於星期三日通過不出席納稅外僑大會之決議案、該聯合會會員、佔全體納稅日人十分之七、又據英文大美晚報消息、納稅日人會於三十日午後在日人總會會議、完全商妥不參加下星期三日公共租界納稅外人續會之決議案、聞此決議案、將影響全體納稅日人、其所根據者、爲日人完全反對公共租界捐稅與執照費擬增附加稅百分之四十、</p>
<p>英美人數已足法定</p>
<p>工部局方面、以日方即不參加、不足影響大會法定人數、因英美等國納稅人可能全部參加、大會人數、可達九千餘人、佔合格票數全部二分之一强、議案通過、絕對有效、故仍積極準備於二月五日重開大會、俾早日解決加捐案、减除目前財政之困難、日來一方面修葺會塲、一方面重發新印之表決票、所有納稅人一律憑票入塲、此項新表決票可於本月三日前發竣、如納稅人於四日下午二時尙未收到者、可逕向江西路二〇九號工部局捐務處索取、或電話一二八一〇接廿九號分機接洽、</p>
<h3>加捐案之各方意見</h3>
<p>昨日有某西人致函字林西報讀者信箱、內稱、工部局之所以加捐、其主要原因、實在於日軍對任何進出上海之物品、徵收重稅、上海人士過去對於此事、絕少加以注意、令人詫異、目前之米價、較承平時代高出六倍、其故安在、棉價麥價蛋價、皆有增加、其故又安在、此其原因、皆爲日方對此類重要物品徵稅、工部局所徵收之合法稅收、若與日軍所徵之非法捐稅相較、無異小巫之與大巫、然林雄吉氏猶曉曉不休、抨擊百分之四十之增稅、實屬不思之甚、林氏應鞠躬盡瘁、而其本國當局、要求供給品得自由出入租界、則一切經濟問題、即可迎刃而解、</p>
<p>局方失當另一外人致函字林西報稱、上海生活費用之所以高漲、除日人外、工部局亦應負同樣之責任、米價初漲時、各報即主張工部局應採取行動、一九三七年時、工部局有權購買及分發食米、該局當時若採取此類行動、則今後亦能行之、如是則各公司能先期購米以供雇員每月之需要、工部局之雇員、亦能享此利益、不致受米貴之影響、然工部局不此之圖、一再提高其雇員之生活津貼及米貼、工部局增加津貼、米商即乘此抬高米價、工部局不得不增加稅收、兩者之間、有似循環、而始作俑者、即工部局本身、工部局若能先期購進米糧、並加以分發、則大局決不至此、因不唯米價可以不漲、即其他糧食價格、亦不致隨米價俱貴也、</p>
<p>難昭公允昨日有一名提密特拉德斯之西人、亦致函字林西報、評論工部局現行執照費之不當、略稱、工部局僅向菜館·飲料店·建築材料·營造商·各式車輛及車夫征收執照費、彼等所付之執照費、幾佔全額百分之九十、而其他行業·職業·商業所付之執照費僅一元、若干商業幷此區區之一元亦不付、馴至一人力車夫所付之執照費、甚至較一藥房或日進萬金之商行爲巨、實令人大惑不解、工部局向日常必需品收執照費、而豁免奢侈品之執照費、其故安在、人力車夫終日嘗外國火腿之風味、而銀行家則受保護、其故又安在、余會詳細翻閱中國行名簿及電話簿、余以爲工部局若對無執照之營業征收捐稅、則欲籌二百萬元、並非難事、</p>
<h3>當局維持充分存糧　保證米價安定　越米五十萬包近期到埠　公倉簡章業已正式公佈</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、工部局某要員在米糧評價委員會兼任要職、昨日（三十日）聲稱、現已抵滬與行將運來之大量洋米、乃上海民食之最佳保障、西貢米與仰光米逾五十萬包、定今後六七星期內運抵上海、勢必使米價趨跌、當局更努力於遏制米糧之囤積與操縱、已獲良好效果、且本市存米充足、則促成米商囤積等活動之動機、必將减少、同時、刻正採取步驟、俾儘可能範圍、及早成立公倉、此舉將有穩定米價之功效、惟對於工部局食物委員會向評價委員會正式建議减低限價一節、尙未採取行動、</p>
<p>充實存米　最為重要</p>
<p>米糧之充足、較諸抽象的統制、更爲重要、當局所能保障民食之最佳方法、厥爲保持充裕之存米、及密切調查市塲交易、公共租界與法租界當局對此獲有完全諒解、以保證兩租界民食狀况之安定</p>
<p>已到米額　為數驚人</p>
<p>最近一月以來、洋米接連到滬、爲數驚人、過去每日到量、逐日在本報商業新聞欄批露、怡和洋行利生輪、於三十日傍晚靠埠、昨日探悉、亦由香港裝來一千二百五十包、至該輪爲止、統計一月份到滬洋米、有五十三萬九千二百六十六包、尙有大批暹越、甸各地洋米、繼續運來、本市民食當可無虞、米價昨日春節假滿、紅盤已見小、本街銷胃亦呆、有繼續下降之勢、</p>
<p>分別規定　米糧取佣</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業公會昨通吿云、「查邇來同業本街發米佣金、頗有參差、易滋流弊、茲經本會執監委員會議決自本年一月三十一日起、無論國米洋米、佣金一律定爲每石五角、各費照例外加、除陳報兩租界當局、暨致函米號業公會外、合亟錄案公吿、又米市塲管理委員會公吿云、「案據本市塲管理委員會年會議決、各費照例外加一案、公決暫行規定如下、浦東每包加四角、浦西及虹口每包加一角、如虹口船運者每包亦加四角、除函請豆米行業公會追認、轉請兩祖界當局備案外、特此公吿週知、」又米號門售每石取佣、照米糧評價委員會規定辦法、即一元五角、</p>
<p>公倉簡章　正式公佈</p>
<p>上海食米公倉管理委員會簡章、已經本年一月二十四日該會第二次委員會議時、在兩租界當局代表監督指導之下、修正通過、業已正式公布、與前報所載草案概同、惟第十一條規定由公共租界工部局暨法租界公董局各推西籍代表一人、爲監督委員、監督會務、並出席委員會議、有糾正制止之權、第十三條規定公倉儲米之數量、暫定爲二十萬包、每包爲一百公斤、由各業分担認購、第十四條規定暫以民國三十年一年爲期、</p>

<h3>所謂西區驚權協定　竟於今晨簽訂　協定全文於簽訂後露佈</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處公吿、「滬西警權協定、定於明（一）日上午十時在市中心上海市政府正式簽訂、協定全文、於簽訂後、即可露佈、」</p>
<p>磋商年餘　終告妥協</p>
<p>據英文大美晚報消息、昨日（三十一日）官方宣布、關於滬西越界築路之臨時協定警務部份、工部局與「市府」磋商約歷一年後、終將於今（一日）晨十時在市中心區簽字、簽字代表「市」方爲陳公博、工部局方面爲凱自威、聞此警務協定有利於公共租界當局、以其規定派大批外籍警官往雙方聯合管轄之越界築路區服務也、協定詳則、將於明日簽字後公布、按關於越界築路區之原來協定、係去歲兩月間工部局前總董樊克令與傅筱庵所訂定、預料西區警務協定今日簽定後、雙方不久將開會議、討論越界築路區之收稅與公共租界內華方法院之轄權事宜、</p>
<p>稅收問題　傳亦解決</p>
<p>據悉、此次警權協定簽字後、去年臨時協定所未得解決之兩大主要問題、可望獲得全局解決、（一）組織聯合警權、「管理」越界築路區域、（二）在越界築路區域成立一獨立之稅收機關、微收捐稅、憶一月前陳公博曾對西報記者表示、此項稅收、將用以維持聯合警權及該區域內之其他費用、該一組織、與聯合警械機關相似、係由雙方共同治理、然歸「市府」管轄所收之捐稅、若有不敷、則由「市府」津貼之、惟稱若有盈餘、並不交付「市府」、而用爲開發越界築路區域之用、</p>
<p>過去糾紛　時有發生</p>
<p>一九三九年十月二十日晨、工部局與「市府」之關係、達於最危險關頭當時「市府警察」企圖威脅侵佔愚園路憶定盤路間之交通崗位、攫奪警權、如是者二次、皆未成功、乃派出便衣隊五人、手持槍械、襲擊駐在該處之崗捕、結果死一華捕、並傷一印捆、彼等爲用暴力使工部局讓步計、復於一九四〇年一月六日作進一步之驚人舉動、企圖加害工部局　辦兼總裁費利浦、費氏汽車雖中彈多枚、然本人倖免於難、然雙方談判仍繼續進行、卒於二月十六日簽訂協定、</p>
<p>局方推薦　警務人員</p>
<p>該一協定之規定、關於越界築路之警務人員、由工部局推薦、「市府」任命外籍警官担任、至該區之警權首腦、則由「市府」在工部局所推薦之候選人中任命之、工都局則任命、聯絡員與越界築路警權合作、官員間若發生意見粉岐之事、則應向「市府警察局長」及警務處長請示、至警員之數目、則該的並未規定、僅稱「將來談判後再行決定」云、</p>

<p>職業</p>
<h3>所望於醫生者</h3>
<p>— 杞人</p>
<p>現在一般商業化的醫生，不但不肯自動的爲大衆服務，連出了鉅大的代價，還不肯盡他應盡的職責。像我從前患了下肢關節結核病，因震於某西醫的盛名，進了他的醫院，受他診治，但因他的失職與他的助診醫師的玩忽，使我的病勢遭受了不應該有的擴大（因敷製石膏細帶不愼，傷害了另一關節），引致了日後悲慘的結局－殘廢。我的就醫某醫生，本是家庭所强烈反對的，爲了我是信仰新醫生，並相信他是有本領有道德的，所以才鼓起了生平未有的勇氣進了他的醫院；乃結果如此，精神上所受打擊之深，可想而知！這些痛苦的舊事也不必去說它，現在所要說的是我對於醫生們的二點希望。</p>
<p>由於吾國大衆的衛生常識的貧乏，一般的健康狀態很是不良，因此灌輸大衆以疾病衛生常識，是件迫切需要的工作。除了在學校敎育，社會宣傳等方面努力外，醫生在診病時便是一個最好的宣傳機會。醫生的責仟不應該祇是替人治療疾病，使病家明瞭病的原因與內容也是醫生的重要副職務；這樣不但可以使病家因明白了病的成因，而防止以後的再患，同時還可幫助疾病的治療。因爲病在病人的身上，只有病人對於病的感覺最眞切，若是病人明白了病的所在與內容，便可隨時予以留意，趨避，加以藥物以外的合理措施，這樣可使疾病不致旁生枝節，同時可促進健康的恢復，對於醫生病人兩感便利。可是現在多數的醫生，還是抱着舊時醫家傳統的惡習，守術自秘，不但不肯－也許是不屑－自動的把疾病解釋給病家聽，就是病人問起他也吝於賜敎。我從前住了半年多醫阮，連我所患的是什麼病也沒有知道，我屢决問某醫生與他的助診醫生，我患的是什麼病，他們老是說骨癆；再問他病的成因，他們又一味說是虛弱。自然，病總是因虛弱而起，然而這祗是間接原因而不是　接原因。我當時沒有知道癆就是結核病的俗稱，如果我知道了我的病是關節結核病，我就會明白這病的嚴重性與長期性而予以更大的重視，那末我相信我的病不致陷於這樣悲慘的境地的！</p>
<p>此外，有不少診務忙碌的紅醫生，每天要診上數十百號的病八，這是件極不合理的事。要知醫生縱然神明，究竟不是神人，疾病不經詳細詢問診察，怎樣會有準確詳盡的診斷，診一病人僅費數分鐘，它的草率可知。爲病人的安全計，爲醫生的道德計，對於診病的號數應加限制，切勿來者不拒，抱多多益善的心理。（稿酬捐贈兒童圖書館）</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>烏煙瘴氣的家</h3>
<p>— 淸輝</p>
<p>父親早年是個政治家，終日只知以酒色爲能事，脾氣的暴燥，品性的惡劣，使生我的母親受不住痛苦，終於在生下我一週歲之後出走了。唉！她是何等的忍心啊！把親生的女兒丢在噬人的火坑裏，遭受種種壓迫，她自己却悄悄地脫離了這黑暗的家，祇害苦了我。在這十幾年的光陰中，受盡後母的氣。挨駡，挨打是每天不可少的功課。父親簡直就不把我當一個人看待，終日不理不睬，不問不聞，每一學期的開始向他討學費，不知要流幾許辛酸的淚。</p>
<p>三年前父親到廣東去經商，回來時多了一個細腰長身的女子，據說是他新娶的太太。起初，這女子的性格似乎還溫柔，說得一口軟綿綿的蘇白。可是不上牛年，她的本性顯露了；終日尋事生非，和撫養我的母親爭吵。她十足是一個野蠻，潑辣，刁毒的婦人。奇怪，一向凶暴的父親，見了她就溫馴得像綿羊似的，於是她更驕傲，更放肆地吵架，打駡。本來已是不安寗的家，到現在更形惡濁，墮落了。</p>
<p>這女子生了一個小妹妹，父親把她當珍珠般的看待，幾乎把我是他女兒的事淡忘了。有誰來愛撫我呢？有誰來同情我呢？母愛是最溫和的，最純摯的。可是我的母親呢？眼前的母親只會把我當做她的出氣洞，祇會每大賜給你幾决詬駡，在你破碎的心上，多劃上幾道傷痕。</p>
<p>木來在求學時，白天可以不在家中受氣，心裏也略覺寬舒些，可是從這一學期起，父親再也不答應給我進高中了。失學打擊着我不幸的命運，終日牢籠似的被束縛在道烏烟瘴氣的家中，一步也不能動彈，成大所看到，所聽到的，都是自己不願意聽也不願意看的事。</p>
<p>我恨不能在脅下生了兩個翅膀，飛出這黑暗，腐敗，不自山的囚籠，到社會上去自立，呼吸些新鮮的自由空氣。可是職業呢？一個初中畢業的人有甚麼職業可尋呢？</p>
<p>徬徨，徬徨，到何處去的問題，終日盤旋在我的腦海裏！（却酬）</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>討債</h3>
<p>— 仙娥</p>
<p>是一個秋末的傍晚，和着表姊倆奉了母親和姑母之命，到一家親戚那裹去討偵。本來我是最恨所謂一副討債者的臉孔，此時自己却奉命前去討債，不是太矛盾了嗎？但因表姊的要我作伴，便無法推辭，祇得快怏然披上大衣，跨上了公共汽車，向我們的目的地進發</p>
<p>在黯暗的光綫下，那緊閉着的黑門開了，替我們開的是一個年老的長者，他雖已年近古稀，但還很淸健。我們和他問好後，他便引着我們走進了一問旣狹且小的臥室兼膳室，在那裏放着幾張小小的床，六七個小孩有的坐在床上，有的站在地下，手中都在摺着手工，看見我們這兩個生客的到來，都張開了他們烏黑的眼珠，向着我們窺視。我看見我們所要找的那一位並未在塲，而那一個年老的長者又爲我們的到來而在忙着茶水，我把預備講的話正想說出來，因他那種不安的樣子，竟把到嘴口的話又縮回肚裏去了。他於是問起我們的近况，他自己又講起他心愛的工廠以前情形，他說：『在戰前，我們的廠本設在虹口，那時我們自己蓋了廠房，招了工人，自己製造電氣冰箱，熨斗，電爐裏種種電氣工具，不但銷在木埠，並且運到外埠，誰知事業剛在勃興，戰事爆發了，我們祇得遷到租界上來。幾年中根本因機器的缺乏而出品頗少，所以現在要維持血木尙難，那裏能說到賺錢呢？』說罷，他又頻頻搖頭，忽然他張開那乾枯的兩眼說『不過如今我們已經預備把工廠向內地移遷了。』我想起了內地的需要，不覺點了點頭道：『這樣是很好。』突然他向我們問道：『不知你們有沒有甚麽事到此嗎？』我急忙搶着回答說：『沒有甚麽事，不過是路過此地，而來拜望拜望你吧了」！即刻我們便吿辭了出來，他邊走邊說道：『眞都是好孩子！有空來玩唷！』我們急匆匆的跨出門口，表姊看着我道：『回去怎樣回答？』我望着遠處閃耀着的燈光，迷惑地說：『還是讓她們自己來吧！』</p>
<h3>朋友</h3>
<p>— 逢渠</p>
<p>不要靠餽贈來獲得一個朋友，你必須貢獻你誠摯的愛，學習怎樣用正當的方法，來贏得個人的心。——蘇格拉底</p>
<p>眞純的友誼，好像健康，失去時方才覺得它的可貴。——哥爾頓</p>
<p>要獲得朋友的唯一方法，便是自己先做人們的朋友——愛默生</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>那個老媽子就歡天喜地的去了。而從這一晚起，王掌櫃的媳婦的怪妖媚的臉，不覺更添上了幾分春色。，在她的內心裏，早有一種說不出的慾望在燃燒着了。好像老天也有心耍成全她，三四天之後，王掌櫃的爲了賣買的事，動身上天津去了，臨走照例還把家裹的一切交代了他媳婦。——中間當然包括着整千的現鈔，和幾扣外國銀行的存摺在內。——使她差一些就要開口向他道謝。</p>
<p>其實，王掌櫃在家，也阻擋不了她什麼；可是他一出門，當然對她史方便些。第二天中午，一只九百塊錢的鑽戒已給王大奶奶買到了；回去的時候，順便又到擷　去吃了一頓中飯，這是專門爲着預先察看那裏的地形而去的。——「地形」？不錯，正是地形！無論男人掠誘女人，或是女人玩弄男人，其情形都和獵人射獵相同；要射獵，當然是先要察看地形的！</p>
<p>王大奶奶差不多要等得絕望了，有一個晚上，當她照例在全神貫注的欣賞着秋海棠所幻化的那個千姣百媚女人時，她眞想把她新買的那個鑽戒馬上拋到台上去，幸而她多少還有幾分理智，才把自己勉强抑住了。</p>
<p>在這一個多禮拜以內，小榮奎的心裹委實也沒有安定過，他已經用盡了他所有的智力了。他的第一個困難就是袁紹文和秋海棠碰到的機會太多，每晚簡直老在一起吃飯，榮奎要假冒他的名字實在不容易；其次可要怪他自己了，儘管他的膽量很大，但吃虧就在沒有念過書，機智還不够，因此一直躭誤到第九天上，他才湊着袁紹文和袁鎮守使叔姪倆都有重要的公事，上吳總長家去吃飯的機會，很徼倖地把秋海棠誆到了　英去。　（一九）</p>

<h3>勞勃蒙高茂萊的成功（上）　演「蒙面人」一劇獲得地位　第一次上銀幕與嘉寶合作</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>賭博聖手　大的在十五年前，一個新聞記者在他的紐的州格林威村寓所，設筵款待大批賓客，包括電影從業員及百老匯舞臺若干名演員，就在這時，曼琳霍余絲帶來了一個陌生的靑年，神姿英爽，身材魁偉，使許多人的眼睛一亮，可是誰知他正鬧着失業恐怖呢！有人在開始一種賭博，這個靑年演員呆呆地注視着，顯得非常渴慕，同時亦非常失望，因爲他是這一種賭博的聖手，可惜身邊分文沒有。在無言的躍躍欲動的情形下，曼琳霍金絲猜透了他的心事，秘密授給他五元錢，於是他欣然入局，席捲了全局，將贏得的一半及原借的五元歸還她。勞勃蒙高茂萊就是這一類個性的傢伙，自經曼琳霍金絲的提携，他不再在賭局中博取金錢，而在社會中博取幸福，結果他是成功的，而且也成了巨富。</p>
<p>出身富室　欲描劃圓滑，謙遜，漂亮的勃蒙高茂萊爲一個農夫是頗爲難，雖然他曾一度做過農夫。他誕生於一九〇二年五月二十一日，他的父親亨利蒙高茂萊是紐的橡皮公司的副董事長，著名的鉅商。他和他的兄弟唐納爾得天獨厚，十六歲時便被送往波林地方的專門學校肄業，同時並在假期週遊美洲大陸，無奈好景不常，他的父親突然辭世後，竟身後蕭條，並無鉅額遺產，僅在波林地方遺下農塲一所，他於是便在那裏暫充農夫。後來他在當地冶鐵廠找到工作，有一次被幾個喜歡惡作劇的工人把他　在煤爐中，禁他出來，幾乎悶死。當他積蓄得一些錢的時候，他往紐的去找較好的工作，終於在美孚油公司的運油船得到船員位置，而隨船駛往聖彼得魯，因此得便往遊好萊塢，但當時他毫未加以思索或注意，回紐的後便解僱，與名期蒂傑　的合租斗室而居，傑南是一個未來的編劇家，他那時却以在百老匯舞臺幹些零星事情來維持生活，由他的介紹，勞勃蒙高茂萊第一次現身舞臺，扮演單身劇盜於「蒙面人」一劇中演出，結果美滿，爲名造片家喬其古克所賞識，而得識好萊塢大明星如蓓蒂台維斯，賴夫毛根，以及給他五元錢作賭本的曼琳霍金絲。</p>

<h3>Hitler's Threatening Remarks Strengthen Resolve to Aid Britain; U.S. Vessels, If Interfered With, Will Be Severely Punished; Lend-Lease Bill Amendment Passed by House Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>London - London commentators yesterday believed that Hitler's threat in his speech commemorating the eighth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule to attack escort vessels with torpedoes would absolutely not affect the country's aid to Britain. President Roosevelt has already stated that the United States is determined to implement its policy of aiding Britain, regardless of the dictator's threatening words. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Washington - Congressional circles believe today that Hitler's threat yesterday to torpedo any vessels transporting military supplies to Britain will not affect Congress's attitude toward the Lend-Lease Bill. Some members believe that the threat is precisely enough to provoke the United States to increase aid to democratic nations in order to fight the totalitarian states. Political circles believe that the fact that the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the amended Lend-Lease Bill and urged its speedy passage only a few hours after Hitler delivered his speech yesterday is of great significance. Committee Chairman Bloom, a Democratic Congressman from New York, stated, "The committee's report is a direct response to Liu Hitler. I hope everyone will add one to it." (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Glass of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee commented on Hitler's threat of torpedo attacks, saying that anyone who dares to interfere with American ships should be severely punished. He advocated that the United States send ships to where it is allowed to sail under international law, and anyone who dares to interfere should be severely punished. All American evening newspapers have prominently published Hitler's threatening remarks, and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have taken note of them. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator George, a Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged yesterday that Hitler's speech stating that he would attack U.S. aid to Britain was a warning to the United States not to use U.S. warships as escorts. George stated that the meaning of this statement is that Germany will treat American ships the same as those of belligerent nations. Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, stated that Hitler's speech was intended to remind the country that escorting ships with warships could lead to war, and there was nothing new to it. Senator Glass, a Democrat from Virginia, stated that the United States should do everything possible to help Britain. "When Hitler begins launching torpedo attacks, we should begin the war." (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London - Today, newspapers are all ridiculing and commenting on Hitler's threats against Britain in his speech to the German people yesterday. The newspapers believe that such threats are not enough to frighten Britain or the United States, and will only have the opposite effect of what Hitler wants. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington - The House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday approved the amendment to President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Bill, appending favorable comments and sending it to the House of Representatives. The House is scheduled to begin debating the bill on Monday. Among the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, seventeen approved the bill and fifteen opposed it. Congressman 約約, a Republican, suggested limiting the scope of aid to Britain to $2 billion, but the committee rejected it. The amendments passed by the House are as follows: (1) The Lend-Lease Bill's effective period will be limited to June 30, 1943. (2) The President is required to report to Congress every ninety days on the implementation of the bill. (3) The President is required to consult with naval and military officials before transporting military supplies abroad. At the same time, Gerard, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Germany before the European war, told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that if Germany defeats Britain, it will carry out a plan to conquer the world. In a general discussion of the world situation, Gerard stated that Brazil has nearly two million people of German descent, and together with the Italian population, they account for 35% of the country's population. The committee also invited Willkie to testify on the bill for the last time upon his return from London. Willkie is currently studying the wartime situation in Britain. The House Executive Committee also approved a bill to raise the national debt limit by $65 billion and authorized the government to collect taxes on bonds in the future. The committee also approved the issuance of small national bonds and Treasury bonds, as proposed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Washington - The Lend-Lease Bill proposed by President Roosevelt has been debated for a long time. When the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the bill by a vote of seventeen to eight, this Lend-Lease Bill passed its initial test in Congress today. After this, the bill can be directly discussed by the House of Representatives. According to the Foreign Affairs Committee, four amendments were made when the bill was passed: (1) The implementation period of the bill is limited to two years, ending on June 30, 1943. (2) A declaration is issued stating that the bill should not be interpreted as authorizing the President to allow American warships to escort merchant ships on belligerent waters. (3) The President should report to Congress at least once every ninety days on any actions taken under the powers granted by the bill. (4) The President should consult with the leaders of the Army and Navy before allowing the supply of national defense materials to other countries. Gerard, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany in the first few years of World War I, expressed his opinion in the Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that he supported declaring war on Germany, but later continued to say that there is no need to fight now.

<h3>U.S. Aircraft Production Last Year Reached 5,700</h3>
<p>New York - The Washington correspondent of the "New York Herald Tribune" telegraphed this morning that when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting yesterday, it invited Secretary of War Stimson to report. Stimson stated that the United States manufactured 2,800 fighter planes last year, of which 2,400 were sent to England and the remaining 400 were used by the U.S. Air Force. He also stated that the total number of airplanes manufactured nationwide last year, including training planes, was 5,700. As for the number of each type of aircraft manufactured, it is not convenient to announce. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Welles Delivers Speech Urging Aid to Democratic Nations</h3>
<p>New York - Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech yesterday stating that if the U.S. Navy is unable to defend both oceans, then the security of the United States will be greatly threatened. Welles stated, "After Germany defeats Britain, the Axis powers will implement a commercial and economic blockade in Latin America." He also stated that Germany will take political cleansing measures in the American republics, or even carry out military aggression. The Secretary of State urged Congress to approve the "Aid to Democracies Bill" because the bill can provide considerable convenience to aiding China, Britain, and Greece, and can also prevent those countries from being forced into a negotiated peace with the Axis powers. He said that such a "peace" document is worthless. He said that the Atlantic Ocean is closely related to the security of U.S. national defense. He solemnly pointed out that the reason Germany is currently unable to carry out aggression against Britain is because the British Navy is able to control the seas. Once the British Navy is destroyed, the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean will be open to attack. The current U.S. Navy is only enough to control one ocean, which is very dangerous. The Under Secretary of State also stated that since the United States has not been able to obtain a guarantee of stable peace in the Pacific, it has been forced to keep its fleet there. Therefore, the security of the Atlantic Ocean depends on the maintenance of the U.S.'s allies. This is an important issue of national security. Welles said that the Monroe Doctrine is completely different from Japan's "New Order." He also said that the U.S.'s relations with Far Eastern countries are based on adhering to treaties and accepting international rights. He said, "We find it quite humorous that the official spokesperson of the Japanese government stated that because we extended our defense to the Western Pacific, we intended to adopt an aggressive policy in the East. This official also told us that since the United States maintained the Monroe Doctrine and implemented it in the Western Hemisphere, it could not condemn Japan for establishing a 'New Order' in the Far East." The United States has always been willing to improve relations with friendly countries within the possible scope. The United States has recently never attempted to establish sovereignty in the Pacific. The U.S.'s entire defense line is influenced by foreign policies and actions. The reason we have demarcated this defense line is to ensure our country's security. The Monroe Doctrine has always been a self-defense policy, not an aggressive policy."

<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Expresses Determination to Fight Hitler and Die</h3>
<p>Chicago - Secretary of the Navy Knox told 2,000 members of the Illinois Road Merchants Association, "I would rather fight Hitler and die than be enslaved by him." The United States is currently standing on the sidelines of the most important battle in world history and cannot morally evade the responsibility of providing as much aid as possible to Britain. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>British and American Cooperation in the Far East, Matsuoka Says Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Matsuoka declared yesterday that if the situation in the Pacific deteriorates further due to the U.S. Congress passing the Lend-Lease Bill, the United States developing naval and air force bases in the Pacific, and British and American cooperation in that area, then Article 3 of the Axis powers' alliance with Japan may come into effect. As for China and the South Sea, British and American actions in those two areas are very relevant to Japan, so the Japanese government is currently paying attention to the situation in those two areas from diplomatic and military observation points. According to Matsuoka, this statement was made in response to questions in the House Budget Committee. The questioner stated that the Lend-Lease Bill currently being discussed by the U.S. Congress also includes Asia, and Japan's lifeline has been threatened by British and American cooperation in the Pacific and the United States strengthening its naval and air force bases in the Pacific. He asked what the government's attitude was towards this. When the spokesman for the Information Bureau received news reporters today, he clarified Matsuoka's views, stating that the invocation of the Tripartite Pact depends on Japan's decision. Future developments may inevitably lead to this. In any case, Japan will be loyal to the Tripartite Pact. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hitler Vows to Launch Submarine Offensive Against Britain; Warns U.S. Not to Interfere in European War</h3>
<p>Berlin - Hitler said yesterday in a speech commemorating the eighth anniversary of his rule in Berlin, "I have repeatedly heard that Britain wants to launch a general offensive. I would like to know where their general offensive will be launched in Europe so that I can evacuate the people there. I am happy not to give them any difficulty in landing, and we will express our views again in the only language they understand." Hitler warned the United States not to interfere in the war, saying that "Europe will reject all attempts by American countries to interfere in the European war." Apart from mentioning the spring submarine offensive, Hitler did not mention the future course of the war, only saying that "Wherever we can strike Britain, we will strike them." Hitler claimed that the people of Germany and Italy cannot be alienated by British propaganda, and that the close unity between the Italian people and Mussolini cannot be severed by one or two unfortunate events. A large part of Hitler's speech was devoted to criticizing Britain, and he reiterated the claim that Germany was not the culprit in the last war and that Germany had not failed. Hitler also said, "We are standing on the European continent, and no one can move us. We have created several bases. When the time is ripe, we will make a decision that will determine the overall situation. We are ready. They will learn a lesson from this year's history. They are now begging the United States for help, but we have already considered all possibilities. Germany has never had any interest in the Americas." Hitler continued to speak of his efforts to maintain peace, saying, "My peace efforts ultimately failed because they were opposed by the combined forces of the cruel Jewish nation of the bourgeoisie and the jealousy and intolerance of the [missing character] ambition. I have never had a point of contention with Britain." He also said, "British labor leaders are now copying Nazi socialism. If the war continues, Britain will suffer terrible consequences. At that time, they will send specialists to Germany to receive our social programs." Hitler reiterated his peace proposals since the start of the war, saying, "After the collapse of the Four European war, I extended my hand to Britain, but I was met with ridicule and angry scolding. They have spat in my face." Hitler spoke of the U.S.'s possible aid to Britain, saying, "Anyone who wants to help Britain must know that all ships sailing to our torpedo tubes will be torpedoed. If the United States wants to interfere in the European war, then Europe will reject this attempt." He also said, "Britain's extravagant hope of ruling the world has been shattered by the emergence of the German-Italian alliance. It is useless to predict discord between Germany and Italy, or to say that Italy will break away from Germany, and it is useless to create the myth of an Italian revolution. We will strike Britain where we can strike them. If Britain thinks that Italy's occasional misfortune is proof of British victory, then I really don't know what it's based on." Hitler spoke of his relationship with Mussolini, saying, "We are neither Jews nor shopkeepers. We have shaken hands, and this is a handshake between honorable people. If the British think that propaganda and slander can alienate the Germans, then I will say that they should not sleep so soundly. This is as absurd and ridiculous as their attempt to alienate the Italians from the Italian Prime Minister. We are now entering 1941 with the strongest armed forces in German history. This spring, we will begin submarine warfare. At that time, the enemy will realize that we have not been dreaming. We are confident that we will win. We pray to God not to abandon our struggle in 1941." After Hitler finished speaking, Propaganda Minister Goebbels shouted, "Fuehrer, we obey, listen to the Fuehrer's command!" (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin - The speech given by German Fuehrer Hitler yesterday was broadcast by sixty-seven radio stations and relayed to Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Slovakia, Argentina, Uruguay, the United States, and Japan. It was broadcast in twenty-six languages, including Italian, English, Greek, Serbian, French, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Flemish, Dutch, Danish, Arabic, Hindustani, and Malay.

<h3>Japan Intensifies Economic Plunder of Dutch East Indies; Raises Several Important Demands; War About to Imminently Approach Malaya</h3>
<p>London - According to reliable Dutch sources, the economic demands that Japan has made on the Dutch East Indies include laying a submarine telegraph cable connecting the Dutch East Indies and Japan, and establishing a regular air route between the Dutch East Indies and Japan. According to experts, the reason Japan insists on these demands is that Japan can use this to gain a favorable position in the Dutch East Indies. Dutch authorities here are very opposed to the principle of economic cooperation between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. In addition, it is reported that the demands also include Japan being able to obtain greater freedom in managing Japanese immigrants in the Dutch East Indies, allowing Japan to enjoy special interests in enterprises and mining, expanding fishing rights, and increasing imports of Japanese goods. The memorandum does not yet demand an increase in gasoline exports, but the Dutch side stated that when the oil agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, which was established last autumn for a period of six months, expires, Japan may make this demand. (United Press dispatch, 31st) Batavia -范摩克, the chief representative of the Dutch side in the current Japanese-Dutch negotiations here, recently stated that he doubted the six-point secret proposal made by Japan to the Dutch East Indies, which was reported by the Moscow Radio Station at 波特. He also stated that he knew that representatives from both sides were keeping the current proposal secret. He said that he could neither confirm nor deny the information transmitted by the Moscow Radio Station. When reporters asked the spokesperson of the Japanese delegation, he said that he had no comment on the information. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Batavaroa - 芳澤謙吉, the chief representative sent by Japan to the Dutch East Indies, declared yesterday to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that he could not be responsible for what Matsuoka said about Japan intending to rectify the attitude of the Dutch through diplomatic protests. He also said that he was half optimistic and half pessimistic about whether the Dutch East Indies would accept Japan's proposals. He also said that Matsuoka's claim that the Dutch East Indies business community would supply Japan with large amounts of oil referred to the time when then-Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi came here, and did not involve the current new negotiations. 芳澤 also said that he hoped that the Dutch East Indies' reaction to Matsuoka's speech would not affect the smooth progress of the negotiations.

<p>Singapore - Sir 多瑪, the Governor of Singapore and High Commissioner of the Malayan Federation, said today that the war is already imminent on the coast of Malaya. Sir 多瑪 declared, "I am not exaggerating, nor am I a nervous person. I clearly tell you that this state may encounter a war, the value of which will be inestimable. If we do not acknowledge this and do not make full material and economic preparations as soon as possible, then we will be too optimistic." (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>U.S. President's Birthday; Broadcast Speech Says Americans Are Still Happier</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, on his birthday yesterday, said in a brief radio broadcast that this birthday was not entirely happy for him. Roosevelt said that in this period, no one in the world can be completely happy, but the American people are still living under the philosophy of a free nation, and their cities are not subject to blackouts like other parts of the world, which is commendable. Roosevelt also said, "We are not indifferent to the situation of free nations elsewhere because we believe in and insist on the right of the weak everywhere to survive. We instinctively recognize the rights of these unfortunates. Under our philosophy of a free nation, it is created by the whole people, not granted from above like an autocratic regime." President Roosevelt also expressed his gratitude to those who supported the anti-infantile paralysis movement he advocated. On the President's birthday, it has become customary for grand "President's Birthday Dance Parties" to be held throughout the United States and its territories. The proceeds are used to help those suffering from infantile paralysis, and most of them are used for patients in Warm Springs, Georgia. President Roosevelt himself recovered in that area when he suffered from the disease. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Philippine President Quezon Says the Philippines Can Only Rely on the United States; U.S. Defense Should Include the Philippines</h3>
<p>嗚尼刺- Philippine President Quezon recently drafted a message from his sickbed to the Philippine Congress, saying that once war occurs, the Philippines will act in concert with the United States. Quezon said that national defense is the most important element of the Philippines, but due to lack of resources, the Philippines has to rely on the United States. The Philippines' affiliation with the United States is inevitable. As long as we are under the American flag, we will rely solely on the United States in peacetime or wartime. The Filipinos are prepared to take on all due responsibilities. The Philippines' manpower and resources are now at the disposal of the United States. The Philippine President also [missing character] that he has requested Washington to allocate the sugar tax and the funds that should be paid to the Philippines due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar to the Philippine national defense budget, and said that he hoped that the national defense program of the [missing character] country could include the Philippines. The defense of the Philippines is still the responsibility of the United States. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>

I and the people of our country all hope that the two countries will fight to the final victory and then stop." Hitler's reply telegram read, "I have received your telegram with great gratitude. Germany will always fight side by side with Italy for a new Europe, firmly believing in the final victory." (Haitong dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Future of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors are generally showing signs of prosperity and joy, having overcome the fourth financial accounting period during this time of national crisis. This is an undeniable harvest of deformed development. As the world situation is changing rapidly and problems are increasing, the future trend of various industries is indeed difficult to predict. However, based on a general observation, one can foresee that a normal future will inevitably be achieved amidst difficulties and dangers, eventually leading to brightness. This is because the prosperity or decline of the economy is an important factor in determining the victory or defeat of war, and the victory of war is an important driving force for promoting the prosperity of all industries. And everything in Shanghai changes with the fate of China. The ultimate success of China's resistance and reconstruction is self-evident, and the support from all directions for China's economy is already apparent. For example, the Soviet Union has consistently provided material assistance to China from the beginning to the present. And Britain, despite fighting a lonely battle, has realized that cooperation with China is mutually beneficial. As for the United States, if it wants to ensure the security of the Pacific and alleviate its concerns in the West, it will inevitably treat aid to Britain and aid to China equally. And President Chiang Kai-shek said that if the United States wants to avoid getting involved in the Far East vortex, it only needs to provide half the aid to China as it does to Britain. Therefore, purely from the perspective of the United States' own interests, it can be asserted that from today onward, the United States will inevitably provide substantial financial assistance to China. This is further evidenced by the fact that the representative sent by President Roosevelt to China is not a military or diplomatic personnel, but Dr. Currie, who is well-versed in finance, economics, and statistics, especially in "the supply and control of American currency." The significance and mission of this are even more evident. According to records, as of the beginning of this year, the United States' loans to China totaled approximately US$240 million. Most of this was handled by the Export-Import Bank and does not include the US$50 million in loans from the US Treasury to stabilize Chinese currency. The currency loan, the principles of which have long been determined, has been delayed because the United States is not hesitant about maintaining the Chinese legal tender itself, but is doing it for the sake of the Chinese legal tender. It must prevent all kinds of possible abuses before the assistance can achieve practical benefits, which requires serious consideration. Indeed, China's currency problem is not simple. It has a long history with British commerce, and it has a close relationship with the British pound when it switched to the legal tender. Therefore, if the United States provides strong support for the Chinese currency and agrees to take the same steps as Britain, it will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Although Britain is currently preoccupied with its own problems and is seeking assistance from the United States, it is unwilling to easily give up its old position in the Far East trade. It will ultimately unite its territories, combine with the United States, and provide all possible assistance to China. From this perspective, it is not an exaggeration to say that the Chinese economy has a superior and great environment and has optimistic conditions.</p>
<p>However, the meaning of general optimism does not mean being carefree. Taking the legal tender as an example, there are many considerations for those who seek to benefit it: First, one must avoid harming the innocent and must take into account the trade convenience of British and American merchants. Second, although the Shanghai market is still concentrated in a corner of the public concession, the internal conflicts and disputes are not easy to eliminate. Third, if the situation in Southeast Asia suddenly becomes tense, there are many doubts as to whether the status of British and American merchants in Shanghai can be maintained. Fourth, the clothing, food, and funds of the millions of Chinese residents living in the concession are almost all linked to foreign exchange. Therefore, the acquisition of foreign exchange and the exchange rate, whether long or short, will have a huge impact on general life, which must be taken into account. Therefore, even with the combined efforts of Britain and the United States, it is not an easy task to seek ways to benefit the legal tender without any drawbacks. Moreover, the exchange rate of the legal tender is irrelevant to its deep foundation; the gains and losses in one area are irrelevant to the overall international plan; therefore, the rise and fall of the exchange rate is not a barometer of Britain and the United States' attitude towards China. From the general optimism, we know that the future will inevitably tend towards brightness. However, in the instant before the realization of brightness, encountering storms and feeling dark, it is all within expectations. I hope that industrial and commercial companies will grit their teeth, operate cautiously, not speculate, and preserve the profits they have made in the past two or three years, so as to overcome the current possible difficulties first, and then broaden their horizons, relying on their profits to plan for normal development after the victory of the war. This is truly the best plan.</p>
<h3>### Thailand and Vietnam Sign Armistice Agreement; Buffer Zone to be Established Between Locations of Both Armies; Three-Month Border Dispute Comes to an End; Japanese Urgently Hold Peace Talks in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo:  The armistice agreement between Thailand and Vietnam was signed on a Japanese ship near Saigon this afternoon, bringing to an end the three-month border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam. According to an official announcement released tonight, the armistice agreement was reached at 8:00 PM today after a ceasefire conference was conducted on a Japanese warship near Saigon.  It was signed and sealed by plenipotentiary representatives from both sides and a Japanese representative.  A fundamental resolution to the border dispute will be discussed at a forthcoming peace conference in Tokyo.  According to Saigon sources, General Catroux, Governor-General of Vietnam, will be appointed as the chief representative to attend the Tokyo Peace Conference. The remaining representatives will be Captain Jon of the Military Bureau, Mr. Jenouvy of the Political Bureau's Diplomatic Section, and three others.  (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Saigon: The Thai-Vietnamese armistice agreement was signed at 6:00 PM this afternoon on the Japanese warship "Natori". The agreement stipulates that both sides will withdraw their troops from the front lines and establish a 20-kilometer-wide buffer zone between the locations of the two armies. The period of implementation of the armistice agreement will last until the resolution of the Tokyo Peace Talks. After the signing of the armistice agreement, representatives from France and Thailand and Japanese mediators toasted with champagne to celebrate. The armistice agreement also stipulates that a buffer zone must be established within 72 hours, and the troops of both countries must withdraw 10 kilometers from their respective positions. However, even if the Thai army withdraws 10 kilometers, it still occupies a certain area of the Laotian province of Vietnam and some small areas of the Cambodian province, because the area occupied by the Thai army far exceeds the 10 kilometers of land withdrawn. The armistice agreement also stipulates that a boundary line shall be drawn in the Gulf of Siam, and neither the Thai army nor the French army shall be allowed to cross this boundary. Furthermore, aircraft from both Thailand and Vietnam must not fly over the buffer zone. The Thai and Vietnamese representatives accepted the Japanese proposal on Wednesday evening. The implementation of the armistice agreement will be supervised by Japanese representatives, and both Thailand and Vietnam must provide Japan with the necessary convenience. After the signing of the armistice agreement, public attention turned to Tokyo, because peace talks will be held in Tokyo soon. The fate of naval bases and airfields in southern Vietnam may be decided by Tokyo, because Japan and France are already holding meetings in Tokyo on Vietnamese economic issues. Sources with inside information say that Japan may demand naval and air bases in southern Vietnam as a reward for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese conflict. People close to the armistice commission said that Japan urgently hopes to hold peace talks in Tokyo as soon as possible. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Saigon: Japan, Thailand, and France have organized a joint commission to discuss the Thai-Vietnamese armistice. The French delegation consists of five people: Mr. Catroux, head of the General Delegation of the Governor-General of Vietnam; Mr. Mantovani, Director of Civil Affairs; Lieutenant Joann, military attache to the Governor-General; Major Alexandre, Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces; and Colonel Bellisair, Commander of the French Air Force.

<p>Japanese Mediation Conceals Other Plans</p>
<p>Singapore: The special correspondent of the Free Press here recently stated that behind the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese war, there must be a plot by the Axis powers. This plot may, in the near future, cause the European war to spread to the Far East. The special correspondent said that Japan is determined to control Thailand and Vietnam. The special correspondent also said that Malaya may be in real danger of war in the coming weeks. He also said that the development of the situation has become an attempt to flank and plan to occupy Singapore from the back door. Fortunately, the back door of Singapore has been strongly defended. There are often opportunities to advise Japan not to continue its plot, but at this time, Malaya is indeed feeling threatened. This is a dangerous imagination. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<h3>### CATC Plane Crashes, Five Killed on the Spot; Cause of the Accident Was Encountering a Storm En Route; Wreckage of the Plane Discovered Near Ji'an</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to news today, a CATC plane crashed in the mountains near Ji'an, the wartime provincial capital of Jiangxi, on January 20, killing five people and seriously injuring one. The deceased were the pilot, Mr. Huang, the co-pilot, Mr. Hu, the radio operator, Mr. Chen, a CATC employee, Mr. Kuang, and Mr. Ye, who leased the plane. The only survivor is another radio operator, Mr. Zhang, who is currently recuperating in the hospital. According to CATC employees, the plane likely crashed due to encountering a storm. It was later discovered by a search team, who brought Mr. Zhang to the hospital last night. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: News of a plane accident in Jiangxi, resulting in five deaths and one serious injury, was learned here today. The plane belonged to China National Aviation Corporation and was leased by someone. It left Hong Kong for Chongqing at 6:00 PM on January 20. The plane was a large three-engine Ford aircraft. It encountered a storm near Shaoguan in Guangdong. Hong Kong tried to radio it to return, but the plane's radio was apparently damaged, and there was no news after that. The wreckage of the plane is said to have been found in the mountains near Ji'an, the wartime provincial capital of Jiangxi. The pilot, Mr. Huang, was from Chicago and left behind a Chinese widow living near Chongqing. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<h3>### Japanese Troops in Eastern Zhejiang Severely Attacked by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Jinhua: Japanese troops in the Haiyan and Pinghu areas of eastern Zhejiang have been cut off by Chinese forces in recent days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>### Japanese Forces in Guangzhou Bay Weak</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to travelers arriving here from Beisha Fort (transliteration), the Japanese troops in Guangzhou Bay are limited to the Xiyin District (transliteration) where the customs inspection posts are located. Other areas remain as they were. However, smuggling is rampant, and the cost of living in isolated Guangzhou Bay is very high. Gasoline, which used to be imported from abroad, must now be supplied to the mainland. British ships no longer go to Guangzhou Bay, so there is a shortage of foreign goods. Although the Japanese naval inspection team is there, goods are still transported out of Guangzhou Bay and into the Chinese mainland. Anti-Japanese slogans have been removed, and Chinese newspapers have been discontinued. However, Chinese residents can still obtain newspapers from the mainland. According to the travelers, the French side has blockaded China, and China has imposed a counter-blockade on France. However, neither blockade has been effective, and goods continue to enter and leave Guangzhou Bay. Chinese customs still operate near Chikan in Guangzhou Bay under the orders of Chongqing. Due to the surveillance of both the Japanese and French sides, Chinese residents can only engage in business. As for pro-Chongqing elements, they have either left the area or remain silent. Rumors that the Japanese navy intends to seize Guangzhou Bay are inaccurate. Chinese coastal cities such as Dianbai, Yangjiang, and Wuchuan have been bombed by Japanese planes. It is said that an understanding has been reached between France and Japan not to interfere in the administration of Guangzhou Bay. (International News Service, 31st)</p>
<h3>### Ministry of Communications Spokesman Discusses Plans to Improve Transportation; The Yunnan-Burma and Xukun Roads are Expected to be Completed Soon; Water Transport on the Sichuan-Hunan-Shaanxi Routes Will Be Improved</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The spokesman for the Ministry of Communications briefly outlined the plans for improving transportation in China this year. Regarding railways, the railways currently in operation are the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou, Hunan-Guangxi, and Longhai Railways. So far, they have all been used for military purposes. They are now being reorganized and will be available for commercial transportation soon. Although only the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is in operation, it is very important because it is used to transport rice and salt produced in the southeastern provinces. The Hunan-Guangxi Railway has been extended to Guilin and recently extended to Guizhou Province. The section of the Longhai Railway in operation is a section of about 100 miles east of Tongguan. After special arrangements, the railway will be unobstructed in the future. Even if Japanese troops bombard it across the river, there is nothing to fear. After the opening of the Burma Road, there is hope for the early completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway and the Xukun Railway. Several sections of the two railways are expected to be open to traffic this year. Regarding highways, the authorities will devote all their efforts to improving them this year. The Yang (Rangoon) - Xin (Xinjiang) highway, which passes through Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Lanzhou, and the water transport on the Sichuan-Hunan and Sichuan-Shaanxi routes will also be improved. Bridges on the highways will be strengthened to reduce the number of ferries. Regarding aviation, American aircraft fly an average of 175 hours per month. Although China is at war, Chinese aircraft fly an average of 120 hours per month. This year, the goal is to purchase more aircraft. The China-India air route is currently under negotiation, and the Ministry of Communications is also planning to open an air cargo service. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>### Japan Plans to Monopolize Vietnamese Products</h3>
<p>Saigon: In response to the British government's approved boycott of Japanese shipping, Japan has prohibited Japanese ships from carrying goods from Vietnamese ports to foreign ports. The port authorities announced last week that goods from Vietnam carried by Japanese ships would not be allowed to be unloaded ashore. Japan's new ban will cause all kinds of Vietnamese products to belong entirely to Japan. It is reported that the French authorities in Annam have agreed to sell 700,000 tons of rice to Japan from this year's rice harvest, paying in Japanese yen, which cannot be converted into foreign exchange. It is also reported that Japan is planning to exclusively control Annam's rubber production, about 60,000 tons per year. However, it is currently facing opposition from rubber producers, because rubber has always been sold to the United States for better prices. If it is sold to Japan, the income will be useless paper without exchange value. Therefore, the French authorities have not yet been able to agree. (All China News Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>### Japanese Plane Shot Down in Jiangxi Province; Body of Plane Falls Southwest of Shangrao; Chongqing Municipality Stipulates New Air Defense Measures</h3>
<p>Ji'an: At 8:00 AM on the 31st, four Japanese planes sneaked into the city's airspace from the northwest of Shangrao and dropped many bombs in the city. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units immediately exerted strong firepower. One Japanese plane was hit by Chinese forces, caught fire in the air, lost its ability to continue flying, and immediately fell 12 miles southwest of Shangrao. The body of the plane was completely destroyed. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The fog season in Chongqing is coming to an end. What the situation of Japanese bombing will be this year has become a topic of discussion among people. Some people believe that the Japanese may change their destruction policy to harassment, using light bombers, carrying small bombs, and dropping them everywhere. This situation has been discovered in Guiyang. The Air Defense Command here also believes that this is possible, so it has decided that in the future, if a single Japanese plane enters Sichuan, a triangular red flag will be hoisted so that citizens can continue to work as usual while being on alert. On the one hand, planes will be dispatched to drive them away, so as not to allow them to intrude into the city's airspace. (Havas News Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Law Preventing Espionage; Extremely Strict Restrictions; Foreign Correspondents Will Find it Difficult to Obtain Information Hereafter</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The bill for preventing espionage, which was submitted to the Diet yesterday by the Minister of Justice, will severely shackle foreign correspondents stationed in Japan. In addition to stipulating that it is illegal to publish or provide to foreign countries any information about diplomacy, finance, and economics that must be kept secret from a national defense point of view, the bill also imposes stricter penalties on various offenses stipulated in the Army and Navy Criminal Law, Military Secrets Protection Law, Military Resources Secrets Protection Law, and National Mobilization Law. Another feature of the bill is that if a person residing outside Japan commits the offenses outlined, he may be prosecuted once he is under Japanese jurisdiction. Article 8 is particularly strict, stipulating that anyone who disseminates any news unfavorable to Japan may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years. Anyone who leaks state secrets to foreigners may be sentenced to death. The foreign Ministry spokesman, Ishii, stated this morning that if the new law is implemented, it will have the most impact on him. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The influential Asahi Shimbun supports the government's bill for national defense security and protection of state secrets, but it said that officials holding such secrets for any espionage offenses that leaked national secrets, the punishment is from imprisonment to the death penalty. Asahi Shimbun said that the reason for supporting the severe penalties stipulated in the bill is to learn from the fact that Germany's conquest of France was greatly aided by the fifth column. However, senior officials and authorities who are directly involved are the sole holders of important national secrets, so if there is any leakage, it is also their responsibility for negligence. The newspaper said, "If the government requires strict compliance with the law, then the government must also be extremely cautious. As for the definition of the highest state secrets, it should be approved and stipulated in advance by the heads of the various ministries. However, when applying it, the authorities must thoroughly study the relevant issues and must not treat loyal and good people as spies." (Associated Press, 31st)</p>

<h3>British Forces Capture Derna, Continuing Advance Towards Benghazi, Terrain Rugged, Mechanized Units Ineffective, South African Air Force Attacks Italian Positions in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>London, Reuters Special Correspondent from the British Middle East General Headquarters reports: After capturing Derna, British forces are continuing their advance, but the terrain is becoming increasingly difficult. The open desert, which previously allowed for rapid advances by British mechanized units, is no longer present. Instead, the landscape consists of rolling hills. Most British mechanized forces are forced to remain on the main road between Derna and Benghazi. There are many locations where our forces can effectively resist, so the progress of the British forces will be slowed. One week after the British Imperial forces captured Tobruk, they occupied the small fishing port of Derna. British and Australian forces first occupied the outposts, then cleared out the last Italian resistance, driving out the Italian garrison. The Italian garrison numbered approximately ten thousand. Most may have already fled. The Derna area is larger and better fortified than Tobruk or Bardia. It has coastal artillery and anti-aircraft positions. Anti-aircraft guns are also positioned on the roads leading to Derna. Derna is one hundred miles west of Tobruk and has a good water supply. After the British captured Tobruk, they sent out patrols for continued rapid advancement, reaching the Gazala area, forty miles west of Tobruk, within two days. Although enemy planes attacked, they could not hinder the British mechanized forces. The Derna position did not have deep trenches, high ramparts, or permanent defenses. However, it is reported that the Italian forces there put up a stronger resistance than in previous battles along the coast. Their artillery also continuously bombarded British positions, but ultimately could not stop the British advance. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>London, According to sources here, British forces are now advancing along the coastal road towards Apollonia, forty miles from Derna. There is no news yet on the number of prisoners and the amount of spoils captured in Derna. It is reported that Italian resistance is much stronger than before. This is not due to German assistance, but is actually due to fresh reinforcements. British forces are now continuing their advance, similar to the battles of Bardia and Tobruk, and are pressing towards Agordat and Barentu. The report that Italian forces on the Albanian front have withdrawn from Tepelene has not yet been officially confirmed here. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>London, A dispatch from Nairobi reports that the South African British Air Force has launched successful attacks on Abyssinia for three consecutive days, inflicting great blows on Italian forces. The British aircraft themselves suffered no losses. As a result of the three days of attacks, a parking area for over one hundred and fifty vehicles in the Nichiri area was completely burned. The Yavello airfield was heavily damaged, with one Italian aircraft destroyed and several others damaged. Six Italian aircraft were also destroyed or severely damaged at Siassi Amanna, more than two hundred and fifty miles from the border. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

(Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>London, Athens Radio announced that the Greek Information Department released a statement announcing that Greek forces have achieved further victories on the Albanian front, inflicting heavy casualties on Italian forces. The statement outlined the battles of the past twenty-four hours, stating that Greek forces in a certain area advanced and won, repelling the Italian forces and inflicting heavy damage. The Greek forces then attacked an important Italian military base. Greek forces on the northern front took important offensive actions, on a larger scale than local activities. In other areas, Greek artillery heavily bombarded the Italian reserve assembly points, inflicting heavy damage. In the area north of Klisura, Italian forces were forced to retreat, eventually finding themselves in a difficult situation. According to a dispatch from Athens in the "News Bulletin," the Italian losses in Albania have exceeded 60,000. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Athens, Army officials confirmed that Italian forces in Tepelene, an important town in central Albania, have been resolutely resisting Greek forces' fierce attacks for several weeks. (Editor's note: Reports several weeks ago stated that Greek forces had indeed occupied the town, but Italian forces subsequently recaptured it.) Now, unable to withstand the pressure from Greek forces, they are preparing to withdraw. The Army Department also declared, "In local battles, we have also been very successful, capturing several enemy positions and taking 200 enemy soldiers prisoner, including four officers." The Public Security Department reported, "All is peaceful within our country." A report from Budapest stated that Greek radio reported that Italian forces in central Albania have collapsed. Greek forces are approaching an important Italian base. Greek forces in the northern region have been able to withstand large-scale Italian attacks. (United Press, 31st)</p>

<h3>German Air Force Raids London All Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>London, After enemy planes raided London on Wednesday night, more came to harass yesterday, causing continuous air raid alarms in London throughout the day. German planes harassed separately, dropping bombs in the London area and in various places in southeastern England and East Anglia, destroying some houses and shops. However, official sources stated that, as far as is known at present, the number of casualties is slight. During one air raid alarm, houses on three streets were damaged, and some women and children were trapped under the rubble, resulting in some deaths. One bomb hit near a tram line on a street, and another hit in front of an industrial building. Over Dover, German fighters repeated the old trick of last summer, shooting down some barrage balloons. There was heavy fog and low clouds under the balloons, so it was difficult to aim despite the intense anti-aircraft fire. In the afternoon, British fighters shot down a German plane in the skies over Essex. Enemy planes also sneaked in and dropped bombs in a town in the East Midlands yesterday, causing some damage and casualties. There have been no air raid alarms in London since dusk. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Suez Canal Area Suffered Air Raid, Material Damage Slight</h3>

<h3>U.S. Dignitary Willkie Inspects Dover Harbor, Meets with British First Lord of the Admiralty for Extensive Talks, Discussing the Entire Naval Situation, Roosevelt's Representative Hopkins Granted Audience with the King</h3>
<p>London, Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Willkie, while inspecting Dover Harbor today, twice witnessed anti-aircraft batteries firing at German Stuka dive bombers flying along the coast. During the first firing, Willkie was standing at the eastern end of Dover Harbor, only twenty miles from the German-occupied French coast. Willkie also inspected a long-range artillery battery. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>London, Willkie, a former political opponent of U.S. President Roosevelt, is now in Britain gathering direct information on the current situation. Yesterday, Willkie took time out from his stay at the Park Lane Hotel to visit a public recreation area, where he played darts with the workers and toasted drinks with many soldiers on leave. Willkie then accepted the invitation of the innkeeper to enter the bar and drink beer and champagne, chatting and laughing with the waitresses. Everyone asked Willkie to sign autographs to keep as souvenirs, and Willkie obliged one by one. Afterwards, Willkie attended a small banquet hosted by Lord Mayor Seaman. After the banquet, Seaman led Willkie on a tour of the bombed-out London Cathedral. Willkie shook his head, saying, "The devastation is such that it is almost unbelievable. Destroying the cathedral is useless to the German war effort." Seaman then took out brandy from the undamaged cellar to drink. Willkie raised his glass and wished for "the restoration of the cathedral" before drinking it all in one gulp. Subsequently, Willkie visited the Admiralty and met with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander. He encountered an air raid and was led into the basement. Afterwards, Willkie stated that he met with Alexander for half an hour and spoke with other officials, discussing the entire naval situation and what was urgently needed. Those who spoke with him were very candid, and he benefited greatly from the trip. Willkie also spoke about the small banquet with Lord Mayor Seaman, stating that they discussed the British court system and judicial matters under wartime conditions. His impression was that British courts are still open and free, and are operating according to long-standing regulations, which have only been slightly modified by wartime regulations. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>London, King George VI received Roosevelt's personal representative, Hopkins, at Buckingham Palace yesterday. He had lunch with the King and Queen at the palace.

Willkie told people yesterday that he plans to leave England on February 6. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<h3>Soviet-German Border Agreement: Exchange of Ratification Documents</h3>
<p>Moscow, It was recently announced here that the agreement on the legal status of the Soviet-German border has been ratified and ratification documents have been exchanged. On January 30, 1941, Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and Schulenburg, the German Ambassador, exchanged ratification documents for the agreement on the legal status of the Soviet-German border. The agreement was signed in Berlin on August 31, 1940, and included several appendices. The agreement is based on the Soviet-German Border and Friendship Treaty of September 28, 1939.

Industries benefited from this, while exports of agricultural products fell to the lowest level since 1869 in the second half of 1940. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>International Anecdotes (2)</p>
<h3>The Secret of the Japanese-German-Italian Alliance</h3>
<p>This is the third article in "Uncensored Report" by the American "Japan expert" Freda Utley, originally published in the New York Herald Tribune. A translation is provided below:</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka once met with foreign journalists in Tokyo and told them that if the United States attacked Germany, Japan would fulfill its "glorious obligation" and fight against the United States, but only if the United States attacked first. This statement reveals a secret of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact of September last year.</p>
<p>Article 3 is the core of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact. It stipulates that if any of the signatory countries is attacked by a country that has not participated in the current European War or the Sino-Japanese War, they shall provide mutual assistance in political, economic, and military affairs. At that time, rumors circulated in Tokyo that there was an additional clause with a reservation nature to the treaty, used to determine whether a country had already been "attacked," thereby determining whether to participate in the war or not. But analyzing Matsuoka's statement, it can be seen that there is no such clause. If Germany and the United States were to go to war, Japan would first determine whether Germany was attacked by the United States before deciding whether Japan should participate in the war.</p>
<p>From the time the treaty was established, the signatory countries aimed to deal with the United States, never seriously paying attention to its application in Europe. To avoid mentioning the United States by name, they specifically marked "a country that has not participated in the current European War or the Sino-Japanese War." In addition, Article 5 stated that it had nothing to do with the Soviet Union, also clearing the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Italy's invasion of Greece can be said to be the initial test of this treaty. This delicate incident made Tokyo silent. Japan apparently did not expect this treaty to apply to Europe. According to Article 3 of the treaty, it must first be determined whether Italy had been attacked by Greece in order to decide whether Japan should assist its Italian ally. On October 28 of last year, the Italian-Greek war broke out. On this day, Japanese morning newspapers paid attention to Japan's obligations under the Tripartite Pact, but by the time evening newspapers were published, not a word was mentioned about this obligation.</p>
<p>The Japanese government was completely embarrassed by this incident, feeling at a loss. If it was determined that Italy was the aggressor, it would offend an ally and lose any hope of asking for its help in the future. Conversely, if it was determined that Greece "attacked" Italy, then it would have to assist Italy in political, economic, and military affairs according to the treaty. As a result, it could only remain silent. Greek Minister to Japan Baritys was originally prepared to lower the flag and return home as soon as he received an expulsion order, but the Japanese government allowed him to continue in his post, and Greek merchant ships were also allowed to continue mooring in Japanese ports.</p>
<p>Many people in Japan have expressed dissatisfaction with this alliance from the beginning, but because the Emperor issued an edict when the treaty was established, expressing "satisfaction," it was unheard of in Japanese history for an edict to involve diplomatic affairs. Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations seven years ago, this was the first time. How dare the general public openly criticize it, but they were all concerned and asking, what benefit is there for Japan to brazenly antagonize the United States?</p>
<p>The Japanese have never received a satisfactory answer to this question. But given the development of the Far East situation when the alliance was first established, namely Japan's advance into French Indochina, it showed the treaty's unknowable elements, making people believe that the scope of its inner workings was vast and would be revealed in the future.</p>
<p>Tokyo diplomatic observers believe that Germany has offered Japan the following quid pro quo:</p>
<p>(1) Japan can obtain a foothold in French Indochina.</p>
<p>(2) The French Concession in Shanghai may be transferred to Japan in accordance with the orders of the Vichy government when necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Germany assures Japan on behalf of the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union will remain neutral if Japan goes to war with the United States in the Pacific.</p>
<p>(4) Germany assures that it is "not concerned" about the Dutch East Indies, thereby hinting that Japan can confidently pursue its southward expansion policy.</p>
<p>The issue of Japan joining the Tripartite Pact has been debated by successive cabinets since the establishment of the Japanese-German Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1936. It was not until September 19, 1940, that it was decided at an Imperial Conference. At the Imperial Conference, the Emperor was heard to have expressed dissatisfaction, contrary to the usual practice of simply approving, and naval leaders also expressed dissent. It was only established due to the insistence of the military. Three days after the Imperial Conference closed, Japan advanced into Vietnam.</p>
<p>Japan had previously sent Major General Nishihara leading a military delegation to Vietnam, ostensibly to monitor and prevent military supplies from being transported to China via Vietnam, but in reality to present conditions to the French authorities in Hanoi and set a deadline for a reply by the evening of September 22. Under threat, the French signed an agreement with the Japanese at 4:30 pm on that day. Nishihara immediately dispatched an officer to Lang Son to notify Lieutenant General Ando, commander of the Japanese army in South China, that the agreement had been concluded, stipulating that 6,000 Japanese troops could enter Vietnam via Haiphong, and that the South China troops should not be moved for the time being. Ando believed that it was not his concern and that evening ordered his troops to enter Vietnam from Dong Dang, causing a conflict with the French army.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news that Ando's troops had moved, Nishihara quickly dispatched another officer by plane to Lang Son in an attempt to stop his troops from advancing. The officer drove a car with a white flag, heading towards the Japanese army. The Japanese soldiers, seeing that it was a compatriot officer, gathered around and relayed Nishihara's intentions to the area commander. However, the commander claimed that he only obeyed the orders of Lieutenant General Ando and knew nothing else, ordering his troops to continue advancing. The French authorities then urgently telegraphed Ambassador Henry in Japan, instructing him to negotiate with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Japanese used an imperial decree to directly order Ando to stop his advance, return the captured French military equipment, and bury the French soldiers who died in battle. Ando finally submitted to fate, ordering 2,000 of his troops to withdraw from Haiphong. Some of them were reportedly transferred to Hainan Island, and the rest were transferred to Taiwan. Ando was also recalled to Tokyo, relieved of his military command, and given an idle post in the General Staff Headquarters.</p>
<p>But the above incident is not enough to prove that Japan's advance into Vietnam was not a pre-planned scheme. The reason why the Japanese government prevented Ando from advancing was largely due to the German pressure behind the Vichy government.</p>
<p>In addition, after France was defeated, Japan requested the Vietnamese authorities to allow Japanese planes to fly to Thailand via Vietnam. The French had no choice but to accept, but later discovered that the French-German armistice agreement prohibited foreign planes from passing through Vietnam, and then notified Japan to cancel the original agreement. The Japanese were furious at France's double-dealing. As a result, the Vichy government finally agreed with Germany to allow Japanese planes to fly over Vietnam.</p>
<p>Hidemaro Konoye, Hitler's special envoy, played a major role in Japan's final entry into the Tripartite Pact. He visited Japan twice, in April and September of last year, acting very mysteriously. It was not until the establishment of the alliance that the newspapers revealed his name and mission. It is said that when this person passed through Moscow, the Soviet authorities assured him that the Soviet Union would remain neutral if Japan and the United States went to war in the Pacific.</p>
<p>As for Germany's attitude towards the Dutch East Indies, it had stated that it was "not concerned" as early as May of last year. At this time, it was still encouraging Japan's southward expansion policy, in order to divert the United States' attention from Europe to Asia, and to realize the purpose of the so-called Tripartite Pact to "restrain the United States from participating in the European War."</p>

<h3>Grain: 540,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai in January, Prices Finally Fall After the Red Opening Day, Rice Prices Expected to Decline This Spring</h3>
<p>The Xiaoguanghan Rice Market, after a week-long closure for the annual year-end settlement, reopened yesterday as usual. The red opening day was auspicious, and prospects for the people's food supply are reassuring. Rice stocks have increased by no less than 400,000 to 500,000 bags, and large quantities of futures continue to arrive. Nearly 300,000 bags have arrived in port within this short week of the new year. Adding in the stock in shops, the total is no less than a million bags. People's confidence is growing. The red opening of the morning market saw merchants thronging to display samples, with the market crowded and lively with sellers. The calls for bids were less confused and more distinct than last year's red opening. As for buyers, whether local shops or others, they had mostly stockpiled during the year-end settlement period, and according to custom, this new year would only be for some social business, so their appetite was limited. Now that supplies were abundant and sales were sluggish, sellers eager to sell lowered prices at each turn. As a result, transactions for various types of foreign rice were still not many, and the closing prices on the red opening day fell by 1.2 to 3 yuan compared to the last sales before the closure. New futures transactions saw sellers but no buyers. January 15th shipment futures closed at 81 yuan, early February at 83 yuan, and prompt delivery at 83.2 yuan, all about 3 yuan lower than before the holiday. The volume of spot rice transactions for the whole day was less than 3,000 bags, and the volume of original bags was 300 tons.</p>
<p>Although the sources of thick and thin japonica rice have not yet been fully cleared, the number of bags arriving in small batches during this holiday period was also large, so owners were quite willing to sell. However, because the flow of goods was flat, prices also fell by 1 to 2 yuan. Wuxi Yuanbai special japonica was priced at 106-7 yuan per unit, Kunshan Yuanbai special japonica at 103 yuan, ordinary at 100 yuan to 96-7 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice at 94-5 yuan. The sales of glutinous rice were lively during this new year, but most of the purchases were in small quantities, so the market was only average, similar to last year. Hong Kong white was 77 yuan and 74 yuan.</p>
<p>The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai has been reported in this column. It is understood that the Jardine Matheson Line's Lesanglun arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 30th), carrying 1,250 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday (the 31st) no rice arrived in Shanghai. For the month of January up to the 30th, the amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai was considerable. Each day, this column reported the amounts. Today, we provide a summary: a total of 539,266 bags arrived, of which 19,143 bags were shipped directly from Haiphong, 82,569 bags were shipped directly from Saigon, 24,436 bags were shipped directly from Siam, and the remaining 413,118 bags were transshipped from Hong Kong. It is reported that a large batch of Burmese rice is about to arrive in Shanghai, so there is absolutely no need to worry about the food supply for the city. It is also reported that the rice prices have already fallen by 2 to 3 yuan at the red opening of the market after the Spring Festival holiday. The sales in this street are also dull. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Flat Selling Price of Flour Set at 23 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the new year's red opening day for flour transactions. It has been decided that the flat selling price of flour from Chinese factories will be changed to 23 yuan, plus 0.3 yuan for miscellaneous expenses. The Fu and Fu factories will continue to supply as usual. The term will be determined after the arrival of foreign wheat next week. The price of foreign flour showed a smaller increase, as 30,000 bags of Australian flour had just arrived, and there were more than 200,000 bags in Shanghai's existing stock. In addition, with the decline in rice prices, it seemed difficult to be optimistic about the market. The market's buying and selling were mostly for red opening transactions. Kaihua, Bird, Zhonglou, and other brands of Australian flour were priced at 24.65 yuan, Huashen and Wild Boar brands at 24.85-95 yuan, and Red Sun at 24.7 yuan. More than 10,000 bags were transacted. Buyers all made inquiries. The agency price for this flour was 24.5 yuan, with about 3,000 bags sold by agencies and 6,000 bags sold in this street. Currently, the retail price of foreign flour of all brands in the flour shops is above 25 yuan.</p>
<p>There was no development in wheat yesterday. The supply of Du wheat remained scarce during the holiday. The stock in the Shanghai concession was only more than 2,000 bags, and holders were all speculating and raising prices. However, the market price of foreign flour at the red opening was mediocre, and the mills were sluggish in purchasing during the new year. Therefore, there were only calls for bids in the wheat market, and no formal transactions.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Oil Most Expensive; Other Increases Limited</h3>
<p>The market for miscellaneous grains, oil, bean cakes, and other similar goods has reopened yesterday after a nine-day holiday break. Trading started on a positive note, with most transactions being routine business. While prices were uniformly higher than before the holiday, there were no significant changes in the overall market. Miscellaneous grains and beans saw increases of one or two yuan, but the demand was weak, and the gains were not sustained. Transactions included over 700 bags of soybeans, 300 bags of green beans, over 100 bags of red beans, 100 bags of black beans, 150 bags of field peas, 130 bags of broad beans, over 600 bags of corn, 300 bags of sorghum, over 700 bags of mung beans, and spot sales of bean cakes. Due to the need to catch shipping schedules, the market for bean cakes was quite active, and prices rose by more than one yuan. Over 10,000 pieces of various bean cakes were traded. Futures trading, which is speculative in nature, reached over 30,000 pieces, with prices rising by 40 to 50 cents. Oil prices varied; soybean oil was affected by continuous dumping from Dalian, leading to weakened confidence and a softening trend. Transactions included 50 dans of oil from local factories, 300 barrels of spot oil from Dalian, and 500 barrels of futures. Peanut oil was influenced by the production area, with supply fluctuating, causing instability in the market. As a result, the overall market leaned towards gains. Yesterday's prices rose about ten yuan compared to before the holiday, but actual trading volume remained low. The results included transactions of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 50 pieces of Yantai oil, 150 barrels of Qingdao oil, and 1,100 cans of Jiangbei oil. Today, 5,620 pieces of bean cake will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Abundant Foreign Exchange Supply</h3>
<p>The black market for foreign exchange saw alternating periods of tightening and loosening. It initially softened due to speculative traders and foreign firms settling accounts, but subsequently, Japanese firms sold and speculative traders also liquidated positions. After this, the supply was abundant, and the market trended towards easing.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Settling, Japanese Firms Selling</p>
<p>The opening exchange rates at the bank for spot transactions were 3/8 39.0625 pence for British pounds and 5.40625 yuan for U.S. dollars. Compared to the closing rates of the previous day, both British and U.S. exchange rates rose by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. However, shortly after opening, speculative traders started buying, and the banks, including the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and a certain American bank, supplied generously, so there was little change in prices. Speculative traders bought U.S. dollars for February delivery at 5.375 yuan. When HSBC announced the rates at 9:30, all rates were stable, but foreign firms began to settle accounts again, causing the market to soften slightly. Foreign banks were only willing to sell U.S. dollars for February delivery to foreign firms at 5.34375 yuan. However, Japanese trading houses conversely sold, and the price softened further. Foreign banks absorbed February delivery at 5.375 yuan. Additionally, some speculative traders followed suit and sold, leading to a brief period of tightening. U.S. dollars for February delivery once traded at 5.40625 yuan. However, the market stabilized by the afternoon closing. The closing prices were 3/8 39.0625 pence for spot British pounds and 5.40625 yuan for U.S. dollars, similar to the opening prices.</p>
<p>British and U.S. Exchange Rates Both Loosened</p>
<p>The outlook for the market is calm. Speculative traders sold, and foreign banks absorbed all the offerings, but prices had already softened. Speculative traders offered U.S. dollars for February delivery to foreign firms, all at 5.40625 yuan. The closing prices were 3/8 39.0625 pence for spot British pounds and 5. yuan bid for U.S. dollars, with next month's rates at 3/8 35.9375 pence and 5.375 yuan respectively. Compared to the previous day, spot British pounds loosened by 0.015625, and U.S. dollars increased by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Fell After Rising</p>
<p>Hong Kong, January 31 (Friday) - This morning, the exchange market opened steadily. Except for the spot U.S. dollar, which tightened by 0.0625 to 23.875 yuan, all other rates remained unchanged. At 10:10 AM, the market was reported as stable. The spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1.50 yuan to 443.50 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was reported as stable, with no fluctuations in any exchange rates. At 2:30 PM, the market was reported as stable. The spot U.S. dollar increased by 0.0625 to 23.9375 yuan, and the spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by 3.50 yuan to 440 yuan. All other rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin U.S. Dollar Alone Tightened</p>
<p>Tianjin, January 31 (Friday) - Today, the exchange market opened steadily. The London telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged at 3 7/8 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer rate tightened by 0.03125 to 5.90625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.25 yuan to 91.75 yuan. The "Joint Currency" on the black market also rose by 0.25 yuan to 80.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Severe Cash Shortage: 70 Yuan Higher Than Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw moderate activity on the black market, with relatively small fluctuations and a continued trend of indecisiveness. Prices initially rose before falling, causing the 6,700 yuan level to briefly be breached before returning. After foreign exchange shifted from loosening back to stable, and then hardened at midday, exchange houses bought and then sold again. The price saw 6,705 yuan, that immediately lead to decline. The price saw 6,625 yuan, eventually recovering to close only 2 yuan lower at 6,648 yuan. Based on the February U.S. dollar rate of 5.375 yuan, this equates to 6,479.1 yuan, a premium of 168.9 yuan. There were still 2,500 taels of January futures outstanding, and yesterday (January 31) was the final settlement day. All transactions were settled at the HSBC counter rate of 5.375 yuan for imported U.S. dollars, which translates to 6,479.1 yuan. Initially, Chen Da sold 30 taels to Cheng Ji at a premium of 40 yuan over the futures price. Subsequently, gold shops and brokers, backed by wealthy individuals, aggressively purchased, driving prices higher. Heng Ji sold 100 taels to Zhong Yu at a premium of 65 yuan and then sold 130 taels to Cheng Ji at a premium of 70 yuan. At midday, the price fell back, with sellers quoting a premium of 60 yuan. In the afternoon, prices continued to decline, and Xiang Kang Yong sold 50 taels to Bao Cheng at a premium of 45 yuan. Gold ornaments rose by 10 yuan to 690 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Moderate Decline of Two Yuan in Black Market</p>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rates for British and U.S. currencies opened stronger, leading to a decline in market sentiment. Gold shops and exchange houses sold off positions before the market opened, initially pushing the price down by 10 yuan to 6,640 yuan. Subsequently, with the support of banks, prices gradually rose, and there were reports of a softening in foreign exchange, expanding the buying interest. Ren Cheng Yong and others aggressively bought, briefly pushing the price above the 6,700 yuan mark to 6,705 yuan. However, with the aggressive selling by the gold shops Da De Cheng and the coordinated selling by banks such as Da Feng and Tian Yuan, the price plummeted from its high. Initially, the price hovered between 6,670 and 6,680 yuan, but sellers were eager to sell, pushing the price down to a low of 6,625 yuan. Notably, Da Feng and others were short selling. Fortunately, several banks took advantage of the low prices and bought, pushing the price up by 30 yuan to 6,655 yuan. At this point, with foreign exchange still soft, the price struggled to rise further, and the market closed at midday at just 6,650 yuan. The market opened well in the afternoon at 6,660 yuan, but shortly thereafter, the exchange house Xin Feng sold, and Da De Cheng continued to sell off a substantial amount, causing the price to fall to the morning low of 6,625 yuan. Although the price rebounded later, it was difficult to sustain the gains. With slight purchases by Qian Dui Ye Bao Kang and others, the price briefly reached 6,650 yuan, but the closing price remained at only 6,648 yuan, a moderate decline of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 80 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at the main gold shops was more than ten yuan higher than the black market price, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower, resulting in the gold standard being 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few actual transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Increased by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments at jewelry stores increased by 10 yuan at 10:15 AM, and remained unchanged thereafter. Da Tong Hang raised its price to 690 yuan, and the price at Xin Tong Hang was similar. The buying price was reportedly 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw a slight decline in black market prices. British and American gold pounds each fell by five cents, and the British gold pound tended to stagnate. The market price stabilized. American gold certificates saw minimal fluctuations, with sellers dominating, and the final price was 18.26 yuan, a decrease of six cents compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong certificates remained unchanged, and the market price continued to rise by one cent. Japanese gold certificates returned to stability after rising, with the evening price still at 1.58 yuan. The demand for Korean certificates was not weak, and the market price rose sharply, reaching 1.23 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Securities: After Dividend Payments, Public Bonds Suddenly Plummet; Another Old Rumor</h3>
<p>The unofficial public bond market opened positively yesterday, in accordance to schedule. Due to the fact that the 31st was the day of dividend payment, the Class C bonds opened at a price of 68.7 yuan. At the same time, Kang Youwei bought and the market price lifted up to 9 yuan. As of then there were no rumors. However, Yu Xing, Da Hua, and Xin mistaken the news that the discount issue in Chongqing did not receive a reply, so they sold forcefully. Lian Yi, Zhen Ren, Chang Xin, Fu, and Xie Kang followed suit, so the market price declined in a straight line. Even though Lian He, Yi Zhong Sheng, Da, and Heng Fu bought, they were unable to stabilize the price. Taking the dividend payments into account, it should've been a rising wind. The result, aside from Class C, all other bonds showed signs of decline. After the market closed, it was discovered that the coupons had been received and the rumours were completely baseless. The informal bond market then rose a yuan. The market can be said to be disturbed by fools. Those who are calm bought low and reaped the benefits. These rumors seem to take place whenever dividend payments are approaching, yet they are always unfounded. Currently, the United States is stepping up efforts to actively aid China, and the atmosphere of peace is continuously being spread, even if it is unlikely to be realized. This would suggest that the other side is in a difficult spot. Given how favorable the current situation is, and how consolidated the finance is, yet the public bonds are declining, the writer understands that the bonds will increase in value greatly. The resulting differential caused by the dividend payments are 2.4 yuan to 3.1 yuan. 200 yuan was transacted. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, public bonds will follow the previous custom, with only the morning session open. The market will close after noon until the 10th of the first lunar month (February 10). After that, the market will be open for the entire day.</p>
<p>In regards to stock transactions, 100 shares of Xin Xin Co. were traded for 21 yuan.</p>
<p>London, January 30 (Thursday) - Today's listing prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British stocks were stagnant. HSBC British-registered shares rose by one pound to 80 pounds. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Guangdong Traders Actively Buy Yarn, Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which was closed for six days, reopened as usual yesterday, and the trend continued to be positive. This was due to the active demand from Hong Kong traders, who were keen to purchase 32-count and 23-count yarn. Market sentiment was boosted, buyers were enthusiastic, and small banks were particularly keen to purchase. As a result, the yarn market recovered after a period of decline. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,439 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,427 yuan. The price for yarn to be shipped on Monday, February 3rd, was 1,443 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening trend for Double Horse yarn was peaceful, as market sentiment was largely cautious, with fewer people taking action. The opening price for Double Horse yarn was 1,435 yuan, rising slightly to 38 yuan. Subsequently, there were reports of inactivity in the outer market, leading to some selling and a decline to 1,427 yuan. However, with reports of increased demand from Guangdong traders and high prices for other brands of yarn, market sentiment was boosted, and the price rose again to close at 1,439 yuan, with strong momentum. It is estimated that 7,080 bales were traded in the morning session, with prices rising by 20 yuan. 210 bales of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong on February 1st. The amount of yarn purchased by each region is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Trade 5,350 Hong Kong 1,730 Total 7,480</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>-Long Staple Fiber Most Popular-</p>
<p>The spot cotton market is showing a slightly firmer tone, as the yarn market is quite stable and so market sentiment is good, but the factory demand has not fully developed yet. The price of Indian cotton has slightly softened, and overseas purchases remain cheap, but there are fewer raw materials for fine yarn.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market trended firm due to frequent purchases by spot traders, followed by good trade in cotton cloth. As a result, the closing price was four to five points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market also increased by three rupees in forecast because yarn factories slightly purchased, as well as the covering of a few short traders.</p>
<p>Although only 600 bales were traded in Shanghai yesterday, all parties were sincere in their purchase of raw cotton, and long filament wool was particularly welcomed by factories. So the future of the cotton market is still optimistic.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Surges - Continuing to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market saw prices rise uniformly, with strong buying interest. The cost of raw materials and weaving is increasing daily, and the factories raised the price of each bolt by 0.5 to 1 yuan, which made everyone more confident. The various guest traders and local wholesalers all opened at higher prices. Compared with the price of cloth before the closure, the price of fine cloth increased 1 yuan per bolt, the price of coarse cloth increased 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per bolt, and the price of bleached cloth increased 1 to 1.5 yuan per bolt. About 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. The Zhejiang, Wen, and Yong traders bought 170 to 180 pieces of fine cloth such as waterfall cloth, and the Jiangsu traders bought about 200 pieces of waterfall blue cloth. 885 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong today, and 4 pieces will be shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of fine cloth, the leader of white goods, was 45.9 yuan. Due to more purchases and fewer sales, the closing price at noon was 46.4 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but the atmosphere was high and the goods were tight, and there was a trend of continuing to rise. The opening price of the Four Gentlemen bi ji was 1.28 yuan per bolt.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Gold Melon Seeds Rise Alone</h3>
<p>The North-South Goods trade all had profits last year. But, in prudence, due to most of the goods having already reached a high price, the inventory settlement price was lower to lessen the risk. Yesterday, gold and black melon seeds and red dates were sold. Ding Zhuang mustard seed was 160 yuan, a rise of 20 yuan, Yang Hua mustard seed was 140 yuan, and Suqian mustard seed was 132 to 130 yuan. Common Zhong Xing mustard seed was 126 yuan, for a total transaction of 212 bags. Ji Kui black melon seed was 118 yuan, Ji Zhong black melon seed was 114 yuan, Tai Kui black melon seed was 110 yuan, Tai Yu black melon seed was 102 yuan, Ming Guang black melon seed was as high as 96 yuan, Zhong black melon seed was 92 yuan, and Ci black melon seed was 88 yuan, for a total of around 400 bags. 60 bags of Ji Yang unified hand black dates were at 67 yuan, and 20 bags of Chang Hong dates were at 26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Open with Price Increase</h3>
<p>The cigarette factory line increased prices. The raw materials increased, so the factories revised the price. Yong Tai He Company's manager Old Knife cigarettes were 920 yuan, Pin Hai cigarettes were 870 yuan, Hartmen cigarettes were 870 yuan, Small Fairy cigarettes were 670 yuan, and Wu Hua cigarettes were 670 yuan. Zhuang Cheng Company's Small Beautiful cigarettes were 920 yuan, and Gold Mouse cigarettes were 920 yuan. All of them raised 20 yuan from the original price. Local traders added an additional yuan to every 50,000 cigarettes sold as a refugee donation.</p>

<h3>British and American Taxpayers Actively Support Additional Tax Plan: Special Meeting Decides on Full Attendance; Japanese Residents to Hold Meeting Today to Decide Attitude</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side announced that they would not participate in the special meeting of foreign taxpayers to be reopened at the Racecourse General Assembly at 2:30 pm on the 5th of this month, British, American and other foreign taxpayers in this port have been deeply stimulated. Yesterday, a British taxpayer told a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency that the actions of the General Assembly have left an indelible and bad impression on the minds of non-Japanese taxpayers. The purpose of intending not to participate today is to make the General Assembly not meet the legal quorum and postpone the meeting again. Little do they know that this move will unite British, American and other countries, and all will attend to strive for the passage of the motion, and crush the Japanese conspiracy to oppose the additional donations. It is actually an attempt to change the status quo of the concession. Regardless of whether the Japanese side decides to participate or not, British, American and other countries are determined to fight to the end.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has Made Strong Representations</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - Foreign Minister Butler replied to questions from Conservative MPs Milner and Galway in the House of Commons yesterday that Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had made strong representations regarding the disorderly conduct of Japanese taxpayers in Shanghai, and urged that the appropriate punishment be given to the president of the Japanese Taxpayers Association, Lin Xiongji, who was shot and injured on January 23. The Japanese government agreed to send Lin Xiongji back to Japan for trial, and took various measures to prevent the recurrence of this unfortunate incident. In addition, he was happy to inform that Keziwei's injury was not serious. When Milner asked the question, he suggested that the British government should notify Tokyo that the Japanese side's request to increase the number of Japanese directors of the Public Works Department would not be supported by the British government. Milner also asked whether the Foreign Minister could guarantee that the British government would closely cooperate with the US government on all matters affecting relations with China and Japan. Butler replied that he had repeatedly stated in the past that the British government maintained contact with the US government on all matters relating to the common interests of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British government still adheres to this policy.</p>
<p>Japanese Taxpayers to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Japanese Taxpayers' Standing Committee met at the Japanese General Assembly at 1:00 pm on the 30th and discussed for about four hours. They have not yet formally decided whether the Japanese taxpayers will attend the special meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Public Concession on February 5th. According to the Domei News Agency, the Standing Committee unanimously agreed yesterday afternoon to convene a general meeting of Japanese taxpayers on Saturday (i.e. today) in order to obtain a final decision on this issue. It is understood that the majority of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association supports Japanese taxpayers not attending the conference to be held at the Racecourse on February 5. If the Japanese taxpayers decide not to attend this conference, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association will send personnel to the meeting to observe. According to news from the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association met at the Japanese General Assembly on the afternoon of the 30th and fully agreed to the resolution not to participate in the resumed meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Public Concession next Wednesday. It is heard that this resolution will affect all Japanese taxpayers, based on the fact that the Japanese completely oppose the Public Concession's proposed increase of 40% in donation taxes and license fees.</p>
<p>British and American Numbers Are Sufficient for Quorum</p>
<p>The Public Works Department believes that even if the Japanese do not participate, it will not affect the quorum of the conference, because taxpayers from the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries may all participate. The number of people at the conference can reach more than 9,000, accounting for more than half of all qualified votes. The motion is absolutely effective, so preparations are still being actively made to reopen the conference on February 5 to resolve the additional donation case as soon as possible and reduce the current financial difficulties. In recent days, the venue has been renovated and newly printed ballots have been reissued. All taxpayers must enter the venue with a ballot. These new ballots will be issued before the 3rd of this month. If a taxpayer has not received it by 2:00 pm on the 4th, they can go to the Public Works Department Donation Office at 209 Jiangxi Road or call 12810 ext. 29 to contact them.</p>
<h3>Various Opinions on the Additional Donation Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain Westerner sent a letter to the reader's mailbox of the Zi Lin Western Newspaper, stating that the main reason for the Public Works Department to increase donations is actually that the Japanese army collects heavy taxes on any goods entering and leaving Shanghai. People in Shanghai have rarely paid attention to this matter in the past, which is surprising. The current price of rice is six times higher than in peacetime. Why is that? The prices of cotton, wheat and eggs have all increased. Why is that? The reason for this is that the Japanese side levies taxes on these important items. The legal taxes collected by the Public Works Department are nothing compared to the illegal donations and taxes collected by the Japanese army. However, Mr. Lin Xiongji is still tirelessly criticizing the 40% tax increase, which is really inconsiderate. Mr. Lin should do his best and ask his country's authorities to allow supplies to enter and leave the concession freely, and all economic problems can be solved easily.</p>
<p>Another Foreigner Says the Bureau is Improper in a Letter to Zi Lin Western Newspaper, Shanghai's high cost of living is caused by both the Japanese and the Public Works Department. When the price of rice first rose, the newspapers advocated that the Public Works Department should take action. In 1937, the Public Works Department had the right to purchase and distribute rice. If the bureau had taken such actions at that time, it could have been done in the future. If so, the companies could purchase rice in advance to meet the monthly needs of their employees, and the employees of the Public Works Department could also enjoy this benefit and would not be affected by the high price of rice. However, the Public Works Department did not plan for this, and repeatedly increased the living allowances and rice subsidies of its employees. As the Public Works Department increased subsidies, rice merchants took the opportunity to raise rice prices, and the Public Works Department had to increase taxes. The two are like a cycle, and the one who started it is the Public Works Department itself. If the Public Works Department could purchase rice in advance and distribute it, the situation would never have reached this point, because not only would the price of rice not rise, but the prices of other foods would not be as expensive as rice.</p>
<p>Difficult to be Fair Yesterday, a Westerner named Demitraddes also sent a letter to Zi Lin Western Newspaper, commenting on the inappropriateness of the current license fees of the Public Works Department. The letter stated that the Public Works Department only collects license fees from restaurants, beverage stores, building materials, contractors, various vehicles and drivers. The license fees they pay account for almost 90% of the total amount, while other industries, professions and businesses pay only one yuan for license fees. Some businesses do not even pay this paltry one yuan. As a result, the license fees paid by a rickshaw driver are even greater than those paid by a pharmacy or a bank that makes a lot of money every day, which is really puzzling. Why does the Public Works Department charge license fees for daily necessities and exempt license fees for luxury goods? Why does a rickshaw driver taste foreign ham all day long, while a banker is protected? After carefully reading the Chinese directory and telephone directory, I believe that if the Public Works Department levies taxes on unlicensed businesses, it will not be difficult to raise 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Authorities Maintain Sufficient Grain Reserves, Guarantee Stable Rice Prices, 500,000 Bags of Vietnamese Rice to Arrive in Port Soon, Public Warehouse Regulations Officially Announced</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times reported that a senior official of the Public Works Department, who also holds an important position on the Rice Evaluation Committee, claimed yesterday (30th) that the large amount of foreign rice that has arrived in Shanghai and will be shipped here is the best guarantee for the people's food in Shanghai. More than 500,000 bags of Saigon rice and Yangon rice are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai within the next six or seven weeks, which will inevitably cause rice prices to fall. The authorities are also working hard to curb the hoarding and manipulation of rice, and have achieved good results. Moreover, the sufficient rice reserves in the city will reduce the motive for rice merchants to engage in hoarding and other activities. At the same time, steps are being taken to establish public warehouses as soon as possible to the greatest extent possible. This move will have the effect of stabilizing rice prices. However, no action has been taken on the official recommendation of the Public Works Department Food Committee to the Evaluation Committee to reduce the price limit.</p>
<p>Replenishing Rice Reserves is Most Important</p>
<p>The sufficiency of rice is more important than abstract control. The best way for the authorities to guarantee the people's food is to maintain sufficient rice reserves and closely investigate market transactions. The public concession and the French concession authorities have a complete understanding of this to ensure the stability of the food situation in the two concessions.</p>
<p>The Amount of Rice Arrived is Alarming</p>
<p>Since the recent month, foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai one after another, in alarming numbers. The past daily arrival volume has been disclosed in the commercial news column of this newspaper every day. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng Wheel docked in the evening of the 30th. It was learned yesterday that 1,250 bags were also shipped from Hong Kong. Up to that ship, the total amount of foreign rice that arrived in Shanghai in January was 539,266 bags. There is still a large number of Siamese and Vietnamese rice, and rice from various parts of Burma, continuing to be shipped here. The people of this city can rest assured about food. Rice prices saw a small increase yesterday after the Spring Festival holiday, and sales in this street are also stagnant, with a tendency to continue to decline.</p>
<p>Separate Regulations for Rice and Grain Commissions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating that "It has been found that the commission rates for rice issued by colleagues in this street are quite different, which is prone to malpractices. It has been decided by the Executive Supervisory Committee of this association that from January 31st of this year, the commission rate for both domestic and foreign rice will be uniformly set at 5 jiao per shi, and various fees will be added separately. In addition to reporting to the authorities of the two concessions and writing to the Rice Industry Association, this is hereby recorded and publicly announced." In addition, the Rice Market Management Committee announced, "The annual meeting of the City Market Management Committee decided that various fees should be added separately. The resolution temporarily stipulates as follows: 4 jiao will be added to each bag in Pudong, and 1 jiao will be added to each bag in Puxi and Hongkou. If the goods are shipped by ship in Hongkou, 4 jiao will also be added to each bag. In addition to writing to the Bean and Rice Industry Association for endorsement and forwarding to the authorities of the two ancestral circles for filing, this is hereby publicly announced for information." In addition, the commission for retail sales of rice per shi is 1.5 yuan, in accordance with the regulations of the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee.</p>
<p>Public Warehouse Regulations Officially Announced</p>
<p>The Regulations of the Shanghai Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee have been amended and adopted at the second committee meeting of the committee on January 24th of this year, under the supervision and guidance of representatives of the authorities of the two concessions, and have been officially announced. It is generally the same as the draft previously reported, except that Article 11 stipulates that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Directorate shall each appoint one Western representative as a supervisory committee member to supervise the committee affairs and attend the committee meetings, with the power to correct and stop. Article 13 stipulates that the quantity of rice stored in the public warehouse is temporarily set at 200,000 bags, with each bag weighing 100 kilograms, which shall be subscribed for and borne by the various industries. Article 14 stipulates that the period shall be temporarily set at one year in the 30th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>The So-Called West District Police Rights Agreement Was Signed This Morning: The Full Text of the Agreement Will Be Released After Signing</h3>
<p>According to a public announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office: "The Shanghai West District Police Rights Agreement is scheduled to be formally signed at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 1st) at the Shanghai Municipal Government in the city center. The full text of the agreement will be released after signing."</p>
<p>Negotiations of More Than a Year Finally Reach a Compromise</p>
<p>According to a report in the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", officials announced yesterday (the 31st) that the interim agreement on police affairs in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area, after approximately one year of negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government," will finally be signed at 10:00 AM this morning (the 1st) in the city center. The signing representatives for the "Municipal" side will be Chen Gongbo, and for the Shanghai Municipal Council, it will be Keswick. It is said that this police affairs agreement is beneficial to the Public Concession authorities, as it stipulates the dispatch of a large number of foreign police officers to serve in the jointly administered Extra-Settlement Roads Area. The details of the agreement will be announced after signing tomorrow. According to the original agreement on the Extra-Settlement Roads Area, it was signed between the then-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, and Fu Xiao'an in February of last year. It is expected that after the West District Police Affairs Agreement is signed today, the two sides will soon hold a meeting to discuss the issues of tax collection in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area and the jurisdiction of the Chinese courts within the Public Concession.</p>
<p>It is Rumored that the Tax Revenue Issue Has Also Been Resolved</p>
<p>It is understood that after the signing of this police rights agreement, the two major issues that were not resolved in last year's interim agreement are expected to be resolved comprehensively: (1) Organize joint police rights to "manage" the Extra-Settlement Roads Area; (2) Establish an independent tax collection agency in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area to collect donations and taxes. It is recalled that Chen Gongbo once told Western reporters a month ago that this tax revenue would be used to maintain joint police rights and other expenses in the area. This organization, similar to the joint police force, is jointly administered by both parties but is under the jurisdiction of the "Municipal Government." If the collected donations and taxes are insufficient, they will be subsidized by the "Municipal Government." However, it is claimed that if there is a surplus, it will not be handed over to the "Municipal Government" but will be used for the development of the Extra-Settlement Roads Area.</p>
<p>Past Disputes Occurred Frequently</p>
<p>On the morning of October 20, 1939, the relationship between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" reached its most dangerous point. At that time, the "Municipal Police" attempted to threaten and occupy the traffic posts on YuYuan Road between Yidingpan Road and seize police rights. This happened twice without success. Then, five plainclothes officers were dispatched, armed with firearms, to attack the patrol officers stationed there, resulting in the death of one Chinese patrol officer and the injury of one Indian patrol officer. In order to use violence to force the Shanghai Municipal Council to compromise, they made a further shocking move on January 6, 1940, attempting to harm Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Although Philips' car was hit by multiple bullets, he escaped unharmed. However, negotiations between the two sides continued, and an agreement was finally signed on February 16.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Recommends Police Officers</p>
<p>The regulations of this agreement stipulate that police officers in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area are recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and foreign police officers are appointed by the "Municipal Government." The head of police rights in the area is appointed by the "Municipal Government" from the candidates recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Shanghai Municipal Council then appoints liaisons to cooperate with the police rights in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area. If there are differences of opinion among officials, they should consult the "Director of the Municipal Police Bureau" and the Commissioner of Police. As for the number of police officers, it is not specified, only stating that it "will be decided after further negotiations."</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Published Last Year's Shanghai Living Statistics: Workers' Living Expenses Increased Again in January This Year, and the Purchasing Power of National Currency Decreased to Slightly Over Sixteen Cents</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>Real Wages</p>
<p>In factories established by Chinese, it decreased again this year. Taking 1936 as 100, the real wage index is 55.33, while it was still 58.59 last year. The so-called real wage refers to the purchasing power of actual income, in relation to changes in prices. The calculation method of the real wage index is to divide the actual income index by the cost of living index. Therefore, the real wage index has dropped from 58.59 last year by another 3.26 points to a low of 55.33. From this, it can be seen that although workers' incomes have increased, this year's living conditions are more difficult than last year.</p>
<p>Workers' Living Expenses in January</p>
<p>In January of this year, the cost of living for workers in this city increased again. The total index was 597.19, an increase of 17.49 points compared to December of last year, or 3.02 percent. The purchasing power of national currency decreased from 17.22 cents last month to 16.75 cents. The food index was 674.62, an increase of 13.40 points compared to December. The rent index was 385.26, an increase of 37.07 points. The clothing index was 432.44, an increase of 13.72 points. The fuel index was 563.05, an increase of 11.19 points. The miscellaneous items index was 497.18, an increase of 238 points.</p>
<p>Situation of Rice Although the situation of rice has improved, general prices in this month are still trending upward. Although the average price of rice in January was higher than last month, since the rice price evaluation committee re-limited prices on the 9th, prices have begun to fall back. Imported rice has arrived in large quantities, and hoarders are also in urgent need of cash. Compared with last month, flour increased by 16.16 percent, so the price of sliced noodles also increased by 21.3 percent. Due to the New Year holidays, prices of salted pork, duck eggs, and soybean oil have risen again. Vegetables such as green vegetables, spinach, and white radishes have decreased significantly, and fresh fish is also lower due to increased supply.</p>
<p>Rent Situation Rent is investigated and decided every six months. The first investigation this year was held in January. Among the families surveyed, 34.43 percent had increased their rent since July of last year. Rents for bungalows increased by 3.84 percent, houses without courtyards increased by 9.61 percent, and houses with courtyards increased by 24.94 percent. Houses of better quality have increased more.</p>
<p>Clothing and Other Items Clothing prices have also generally increased, ranging from 0.81 to 15.06 percent. Homespun cloth has increased the most. Among fuel items, coal balls have increased by 5.91 percent, kerosene has increased by 11.45 percent, and matches have increased by 23.76 percent. In the miscellaneous items category, outside of boiled water and tea, which have not changed, the rest have increased by 3.62 to 14.37 percent. In the index of 58 items, 37 items were higher in price than in December of last year, 15 items were lower, and 6 items remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Vietnamese Delegation to Japan Passes Through Shanghai and Makes a Statement: Confirms that France Will Definitely Restore Pétain</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Local News: Nguyen Dinh Luan, former Minister of Information of the Annam Imperial Court and private secretary to the Annam Empress, was recently appointed as one of the French representatives for the French-Japanese economic negotiations on Vietnam and has recently arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to stay for a few days before going to Tokyo to participate in the negotiations. Mr. Nguyen made the following statement yesterday at the French Radio Station in this city: "When France joined the Second European War, we firmly believed that it would be victorious. However, it suffered a disastrous defeat, which was truly unexpected. Although France has suffered defeat, our loyalty to France has never changed. I dare say that we have never had a moment of disloyalty. France has always treated us with leniency and has never infringed upon our will or cultural heritage. This is why we love France. Although it is now facing misfortune, it will definitely restore its greatness in the future, which can be asserted. As for us, the only thing we can do is to share its pain and assist in its reconstruction. In short, we must support Marshal Pétain. Marshal Pétain's plan to reform and revive France is based on the theory of three major elements, including work, family, and motherland. We know this principle very well, because the Annam nation lives and breathes in a family atmosphere, and what it usually admires most is order, government, and power, which Marshal Pétain already possesses. His Majesty Emperor Bảo Đại of our country expressed his admiration for Marshal Pétain at the beginning of his administration, which is of great significance. In addition, when His Majesty held grand ceremonies in the palace, he repeatedly stated that the people must sincerely support the leader's reform plan and his authority. His admiration for the Marshal can be seen from this. As for Vietnam, it is currently very peaceful, with good order and a prosperous economy. Goods are being exported as usual. The people of Vietnam know that in the midst of this world turmoil, they are fortunate to be spared, which is a great blessing from heaven. They also know that the French government will never disregard the people of Vietnam, so their only hope is to continue to live and work in peace under French protection. We look forward to the future with great confidence."</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Minister of the Navy, Osumi, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japan Again Blocks Bridges</p>
<p>Former Japanese Minister of the Navy, Admiral Osumi, is currently visiting Shanghai. The Japanese blocked the bridges over the Hongkou and Suzhou Rivers leading into Hongkou from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM yesterday (the 31st). Osumi will stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Japan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Elections</h3>
<p>The upcoming elections for the Shanghai Municipal Council are expected to be more intense than the last, as the Japanese side is attempting to undermine the status quo of the Public Concession and disregarding the gentlemen's agreement that the proportion of councilors from Britain, the United States, and Japan should be 5:2:2. However, judging from the current situation of the foreign ratepayers' special conference, it is undoubtedly that Britain and the United States still have the upper hand. The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities have chosen April 10 (Thursday) and April 11 (Friday) as the dates for the council elections, and are now submitting them to the Consular Body for review so that the Consular Body can issue a notice for public knowledge. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Revenue Department is currently rushing to compile a register of foreign ratepayers' names.</p>
<h3>Primary Postal Clerk Exam Papers to be Released in Early March</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration held the Primary Postal Clerk Examination on October 19. All 10,318 exam papers, with a total of 1,474 participants, require time for detailed review due to the large number of participants. The rumor that they will be released soon is inaccurate. According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai Post Office, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, has requested the examiners to start grading the papers at the office yesterday due to their busy schedules. The initial review period is 10 days. After the review and a two-week second review, all scores are expected to be finalized by the end of this month. The release date will be in early March.</p>
<h3>Westerner Argues with Military Officer Over a Woman, Attempting Suicide by Shooting: Rival Encounter Leads to Argument, Goes to Friend's Place to Discuss, Shoots Servant</h3>
<p>William John Cruz, a Westerner without consular jurisdiction (an unrecognized American who works as a clerk at the East Asia Transportation Company at 17 Guangdong Road, residing at 1, Lane 156, Goubert Road, French Concession), was in love with and engaged to a Western woman named Kempe. However, Cruz recently learned that his fiancée had a relationship with U.S. Navy Lieutenant Robert Wilkie, causing him great mental distress. At 5:10 PM the day before yesterday, Cruz saw his fiancée walking with Wilkie on Route des Soeurs, and he could not help but feel jealous. They argued on the street. Later, because they and a Western detective named Baden from the Central Police Station (who resides at Room 4B, Bank of China Building, 80 Jing'an Temple Road) were all friends, they went to Baden's residence to discuss the matter. At that time, Baden was about to go to the police station to work, so while he was putting on his uniform, he placed his duty pistol on the table. Unexpectedly, Cruz suddenly grabbed the gun, loaded it, and fled into the bathroom. Baden chased after him, but the bathroom door was already closed. While Cruz's hand holding the gun was being blocked by the door, a gunshot suddenly went off. The Western's Chinese servant, Shen Changfa, was hit, and his legs were injured and he collapsed to the ground. As a result, Cruz's gun was taken away. The Chengdu Road Police Station, hearing the noise, sent Western detective Tuiller to investigate. In addition to sending the injured person to Baolong Hospital for treatment, they took Cruz into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case, requesting that he be held in custody. When questioned, Cruz confessed that the purpose of grabbing the gun was to commit suicide. He hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to appear in court and request bail. The police station did not object. Judge Liu ruled that Cruz was granted bail of 500 yuan and released from custody. The case was adjourned for seven days for further review.</p>
<h3>Western Woman Falls From the Eighth Floor of the Washington Apartments</h3>
<p>Dies Instantly</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, a foreign woman in her forties suddenly jumped from the eighth floor of the Washington Apartments at 305 Route Pétain, French Concession, falling to her death on the ground. The police summoned an ambulance and sent her to the hospital, then transferred her to the mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>Accused of Assault for Claiming Patrolman Harassed Woman</h3>
<p>Conflict Over Boarding a Public Bus, Husband, Wife, and Concubine Fined The Zhejiang native, Li Wen, residing at 66 XinZha Road, currently works as a broker at the exchange. At 10:15 PM the night before last, he was with his wife, Li Wang, and his concubine, Li Bao, leaving Qi's house and waiting for the No. 10 public bus at the intersection of Connaught Road and Gordon Road. At the same time, Chinese patrolman Chen Shizhen, No. 2144 of the Shanghai Municipal Police, was also waiting for the bus at the same place. Due to the rush to board the bus, the patrolman's hand touched Li Wang's hair. Li immediately accused the patrolman of harassment and began to scold him, leading to a dispute. The couple and concubine surrounded and beat the patrolman, causing him minor injuries and damaging the belt on his uniform. The whistle was lost. When the bus arrived at Route des Soeurs, the patrolman summoned Chinese patrolman No. 13 to help, and together they detained Li and his family at the Gordon Road Police Station. Li and his family were violent towards the patrolman. After investigation, it was determined that Li and his family had committed a joint assault and were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, prosecuted them for assault and stated that Li Wen had previously been arrested for political reasons but was not prosecuted. Li Wang had been fined twice by this court for soliciting prostitution. When questioned, Li and others stated that the patrolman had harassed them first and then severely beat them. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, Li Wen was sentenced to a fine of 60 yuan, and Li Wang and Li Ju were each sentenced to a fine of 40 yuan. If they were to serve labor service, it would be calculated at 2 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Judge of the Civil Division of the Senior Second Branch Court, Luo Chongtai, Passes Away</h3>
<p>Luo Chongtai, also known as Yunbo, the current judge of the Civil Division of the First Branch Court of the Jiangsu Senior Court, was 54 years old this year. He was originally from Jurong, Jiangsu, and resided in Jinan. His Shanghai residence was at 30 Cihou North Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, Hartung Road. Luo originally suffered from heart disease, which came and went. On the first day of the Lunar New Year this year, at around 11:30 PM, Luo ordered his servant to spread out the bedding, turned off the lights, and went to bed. Although Luo went to bed, he did not take off his clothes, but lay down on the bed. Half an hour later, the servant found Luo lying stiffly on the bed, lifeless. He rushed to inform the mistress. Mrs. Luo was playing mahjong and, upon hearing the report, ordered people to look for a doctor everywhere. However, due to old customs, most doctors were unwilling to make house calls on the first day of the New Year, and it was also late at night, making it even more difficult to find a doctor. Moreover, heart disease could not be treated by ordinary doctors. It was not until around 2:00 AM that a doctor was found, but it was too late to save him. Luo passed away. His body was placed in a coffin at the Central Funeral Home the other day. The president, chief, judges, and prosecutors of the Senior Court and the Special First District Court all went to offer condolences. Luo graduated from the Beijing Judicial Training Institute and was a classmate of Feng Shide, the current presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Special First District Local Court. During the Beiyang government era, he served as a judge in the Shanxi Higher Court and the Local Court. Later, he followed Xu Weizhen, the then-president of the Senior First Branch Court, to serve as a judge in the Provisional Court. When the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special First District Court, Luo served as a judge in the Criminal Division of that court, and later transferred to the Civil Division. He later transferred again to the Civil Division of the First Branch Court. Luo had been a judge for more than a decade and had no savings. He had no children and only one wife. It is said that Feng Shide and others, recognizing that Luo had been a clean and upright official and had a meager estate, planned to jointly petition the Ministry of Justice to grant him a posthumous pension.</p>
<h3>Publication of the International Relief Committee's General Report</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee was closed at the end of April last year. It had accommodated more than 61,000 refugees and promoted refugee production and refugee education. It was also entrusted by the French Concession authorities to accommodate more than 1,400 street beggars, providing them with rehabilitation education and teaching them various crafts so that they could support themselves after leaving the center. Since August 13, in addition to receiving food and materials from the National Government and the Refugee Association, as well as donations from various sectors, the committee received a total of 742,774 yuan, one jiao, and eight fen in donations. It is said that the committee has completed the compilation of the general report, which includes 50 pages of refugee photos, with a new atmosphere and vitality on paper, which is a rare find in the report. A credit listing of more than 130 pages is attached for donors to check.

<h3>The Ministry of Education Rewards Guidance Personnel, Orders Compliance with Regulations on Vacation Procedures, One Year of Vacation Granted after Nine Years of Continuous Service</h3>
<p>Regarding education matters in this city, yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to reward guidance personnel in secondary schools. It instructed compliance with Article 113 of the revised secondary school regulations and Article 114 of the revised normal school regulations. Those who have served continuously for more than nine years, have outstanding performance, have not taken vacation for further study, and have reported to and been filed with the competent educational authority, may take one year of vacation for further study. Regarding this matter, yesterday a copy of the original text was made and forwarded to all schools for compliance. The original document will not be sent separately. It is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Ministry Order Original Text: It is noted that at the Guidance Conference convened by the Ministry this year, it was resolved that "to reward the work efficiency of guidance personnel, those who have worked in schools for more than five years should be given an opportunity of one year or half a year to investigate the actual conditions of guidance in various regions and schools, or to be assigned to study issues related to guidance." Furthermore, it is noted that the Ministry, in order to provide teachers who have served for many years with the opportunity to leave school for research or investigation to conduct more in-depth research, stipulated in Article 113 of the revised secondary school regulations and Article 114 of the revised normal school regulations that secondary school teachers who have continued to serve in a school for nine years or more may take one year of vacation to engage in research and investigation. However, the work of guidance personnel in various schools is heavy and busy, and they rarely have the opportunity to enjoy regular holidays for rest and recuperation like other teachers. If they have served for many years and are not given the same treatment as leaving school for investigation or research, it may be difficult to expect them to further their studies. Now, in order to encourage the service enthusiasm of guidance personnel in various schools and improve guidance efficiency, guidance personnel in charge of secondary schools who have been reported to and filed with the competent educational authority shall be allowed to follow the provisions of Article 113 of the revised secondary school regulations and Article 114 of the revised normal school regulations for further study in order to enhance guidance efficiency. It is hereby ordered to be forwarded for compliance. (Dahua News Agency)</p>

<h3>What is Expected of Doctors</h3>
<p>— Qiren</p>
<p>Nowadays, commercialized doctors not only refuse to serve the public proactively, but even with a hefty price, they are unwilling to fulfill their due responsibilities. For example, I once suffered from tuberculosis of the lower limb joints. Impressed by the fame of a certain Western doctor, I entered his hospital and was treated by him. However, due to his dereliction of duty and the negligence of his assistant, my condition suffered unnecessary expansion (due to improper application of a plaster cast, another joint was injured), leading to a tragic outcome - disability. My family strongly opposed my seeing that particular doctor. However, because I believed in new doctors and trusted that he was capable and moral, I mustered unprecedented courage to enter his hospital. The result was such that the spiritual blow I received was imaginable! There is no need to talk about these painful old events. What I want to say now are my two hopes for doctors.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of public health knowledge in our country, the general health condition is very poor. Therefore, it is an urgent task to instill disease and health knowledge to the public. In addition to efforts in school education and social publicity, doctors provide the best opportunity for publicity during the diagnosis. A doctor's responsibility should not only be to treat people's diseases but to make patients understand the cause and content of the disease, which is also an important secondary duty of the doctor. This not only allows patients to prevent future illnesses by understanding the cause of the disease but also helps with the treatment. Because the disease is on the patient's body, only the patient's feeling about the disease is most genuine. If the patient understands the location and content of the disease, they can pay attention to it at any time, avoid it, and take reasonable measures other than medicine. This can prevent the disease from branching out and promote the restoration of health, which is convenient for both doctors and patients. However, most doctors still hold the old bad habits of traditional doctors, keeping the skills secret. They are not only unwilling - maybe they disdain - to automatically explain the disease to the patient, but they are also reluctant to teach even when the patient asks. I stayed in the hospital for more than half a year, and I didn't even know what disease I was suffering from. I repeatedly asked the doctor and his assistant what disease I was suffering from. They always said bone tuberculosis. When I asked them the cause of the disease, they said it was weakness. Naturally, the disease always arises from weakness, but this is only an indirect cause and not a direct cause. At that time, I didn't know that tuberculosis was the common name for tuberculosis. If I knew that my disease was joint tuberculosis, I would understand the seriousness and long-term nature of the disease and pay more attention to it. Then I believe that my disease would not have fallen into such a tragic situation!</p>
<p>In addition, there are many red doctors who are busy with diagnosis and have to diagnose dozens or hundreds of patients every day, which is extremely unreasonable. You must know that even if a doctor is a god, he is not a god. How can an accurate and detailed diagnosis be made without detailed inquiries and examinations? It only takes a few minutes to diagnose a patient, and its perfunctoriness can be known. For the safety of patients and the morality of doctors, the number of diagnosed patients should be limited. Do not refuse anyone who comes, and embrace the psychology of the more, the better. (Remuneration donated to the children's library)</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Smoky Home</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>My father was a politician in his early years. All he knew was indulging in wine and women. His irritable temper and bad character made my mother unable to bear the pain, and she finally left one week after giving birth to me. Alas! How ruthless she was! Leaving her own daughter in a man-eating fire pit, suffering all kinds of oppression, she quietly broke away from this dark home, only to hurt me. In these ten years, I have suffered all the abuse from my stepmother. Scolding and beatings are daily lessons. My father simply doesn't treat me like a human being. He ignores me all day long, doesn't ask, doesn't listen. At the beginning of each semester, asking him for tuition requires shedding many bitter tears.</p>
<p>Three years ago, my father went to Guangdong to do business. When he came back, he had a slender woman with a small waist. It is said that she was his newly married wife. At first, this woman's character seemed gentle, speaking a soft Suzhou dialect. But in less than half a year, her true nature was revealed; she was finding faults all day long, and arguing with the mother who raised me. She is totally a barbarian, shrewish, and vicious woman. Strangely, my father, who has always been violent, becomes as docile as a sheep when he sees her. So she is more arrogant, and quarrels and scolds more recklessly. The already uneasy home has become even more turbid and degenerate.</p>
<p>This woman gave birth to a little sister. My father treats her like a pearl, almost forgetting that I am his daughter. Who comes to caress me? Who comes to sympathize with me? Maternal love is the most gentle and pure. But what about my mother? The mother in front of me will only treat me as her punching bag, only give you a few more scoldings, and draw a few more scars on your broken heart.</p>
<p>Originally, when I was studying, I could avoid being angry at home during the day, and I felt a little relieved, but from this semester onwards, my father no longer agreed to let me go to high school. Dropping out of school hits my unfortunate fate, and I am bound in a smoky home like a cage all day long, unable to move a step. All I see and hear are things I don't want to hear or see.</p>
<p>I wish I could grow two wings under my ribs, fly out of this dark, corrupt, and unfree prison, go to society to be independent, and breathe some fresh free air. But what about the profession? What profession can a junior high school graduate find?</p>
<p>Bewildered, bewildered, the question of where to go is hovering in my mind all day long! (Remuneration withheld)</p>
<p>Society</p>
<h3>Debt Collection</h3>
<p>— Xian'e</p>
<p>It was an autumn evening. My cousin and I were ordered by our mother and aunt to go to a relative's house to collect debts. Originally, I hated the so-called face of a debt collector the most. At this time, I was ordered to go to collect debts, wasn't it too contradictory? But because my cousin wanted me to accompany her, I couldn't refuse, so I quickly put on my coat, got on the bus, and headed for our destination.</p>
<p>In the dim light, the tightly closed black door opened. The one who opened the door for us was an elderly elder. Although he was nearly seventy years old, he was still very healthy. After we greeted him, he led us into a narrow and small bedroom and dining room. There were several small beds, and six or seven children were sitting on the beds or standing on the ground, all folding handicrafts in their hands. Seeing the arrival of us two strangers, they all opened their dark eyes and peered at us. I saw that the person we were looking for was not present, and the elderly elder was busy making tea for our arrival. I was about to say what I had prepared, but because of his uneasy appearance, I retracted the words back into my stomach. He then asked about our recent situation, and he talked about the previous situation of his beloved factory. He said: "Before the war, our factory was located in Hongkou. At that time, we built our own factory buildings, recruited workers, and manufactured various electrical tools such as electric refrigerators, irons, and electric furnaces. They were not only sold in this city, but also shipped to other ports. Who knew that the business was just booming when the war broke out, so we had to move to the concession. For several years, the production has been quite small due to the lack of machines, so it is still difficult to maintain the capital now, how can we talk about making money?" After saying that, he shook his head frequently. Suddenly, he opened his dry eyes and said, "But now we are already preparing to move the factory to the interior." I thought of the needs of the interior, and nodded without realizing it: "This is very good." Suddenly he asked us, "I wonder if you have anything to do here?" I hurriedly answered, "There is nothing, but we just passed by here and came to visit you!" Immediately we said goodbye and came out. He said as he walked, "You are really good children! Come and play when you are free!" We hurriedly stepped out of the door. My cousin looked at me and said, "How do we answer when we go back?" I looked at the flashing lights in the distance and said confusedly, "Let them come themselves!"</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>— Fengqu</p>
<p>Do not rely on gifts to gain a friend, you must contribute your sincere love and learn how to win people's hearts in a proper way. - Socrates</p>
<p>True friendship is like health, only when you lose it do you realize its preciousness. - Colton</p>
<p>The only way to gain friends is to be friends with people yourself - Emerson</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The old woman left happily. From that night on, the strange and charming face of Wang's wife unconsciously added a bit more color. In her heart, there was an unspeakable desire burning. It seemed that even God intended to help her succeed. Three or four days later, Wang left for Tianjin for business matters. Before leaving, he habitually explained everything in the family to his wife, including thousands of cash and several passbooks from foreign banks, which made her almost want to thank him.</p>
<p>In fact, Wang couldn't stop her from doing anything at home, but his departure was certainly more convenient for her. The next day at noon, Wang's wife had already bought a diamond ring worth nine hundred yuan. On the way back, she went to the theater for lunch, which was specifically to check out the terrain there in advance. "Terrain"? That's right, it's terrain! Whether a man seduces a woman or a woman plays with a man, the situation is the same as a hunter hunting; to hunt, of course, you must first check out the terrain!</p>
<p>Wang's wife was almost waiting in despair. One night, when she was, as usual, admiring the woman with a thousand charming faces transformed by the begonia with all her attention, she really wanted to throw the diamond ring she had just bought onto the stage, but fortunately, she still had some rationality, so she reluctantly restrained herself.</p>
<p>In this week or so, Xiao Rongkui's heart was indeed not at peace. He had exhausted all his intelligence. His first difficulty was that Yuan Shaowen and Qiuhaitang had too many opportunities to meet. They simply ate together every night. It was really not easy for Rongkui to impersonate his name; Secondly, he can only blame himself. Although his courage was great, he suffered from not having studied, and his wit was not enough, so he has been delayed until the ninth day, when he happened to take advantage of the opportunity that Yuan Shaowen and Yuan Zhenshoushi had important official business and went to Director Wu's house for dinner, and he managed to lure Qiuhaitang to the United Kingdom.

<h3>Robert Montgomery's Success (Part 1) Achieving Status Through "The Masked Man" Appearing on Screen for the First Time with Garbo</h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>A Gambling Expert Fifteen years ago, a journalist in his Greenwich Village apartment in New York City hosted a banquet for a large number of guests, including film professionals and some Broadway actors. It was then that Marilyn Hawkins brought in an unfamiliar young man, handsome and tall, who caught the eye of many. But who knew he was suffering from the terror of unemployment! Someone started a gambling game, and the young actor stared blankly, appearing very eager but also very disappointed, because he was an expert in this kind of gambling, but unfortunately had no money on him. Sensing his unspoken eagerness, Marilyn Hawkins secretly gave him five dollars, and he happily joined the game, sweeping the whole table, returning half of his winnings and the original borrowed five dollars to her. Robert Montgomery was this kind of guy. Since being supported by Marilyn Hawkins, he no longer gambled for money but gambled for happiness in society. As a result, he succeeded and became very wealthy.</p>
<p>Born into a Wealthy Family It is difficult to portray the smooth, humble, and handsome Robert Montgomery as a farmer, although he once was one. He was born on May 21, 1902. His father, Henry Montgomery, was the vice chairman of a rubber company in New York, a famous business tycoon. He and his brother, Donald, were blessed. At the age of sixteen, they were sent to a specialized school in Bolling and traveled around the American continent during the holidays. Unfortunately, good times didn't last. After his father suddenly passed away, he left behind a bleak situation with no huge inheritance, only a farm in Bolling. He temporarily worked there as a farmer. Later, he found a job at a local ironworks. Once, some mischievous workers locked him in a coal furnace, almost suffocating him. When he had saved some money, he went to New York to find a better job and finally got a crew position on a tanker for Mobil Oil, sailing to St. Peter's. This allowed him to visit Hollywood, but he didn't think about it much at the time. After returning to New York, he quit and shared a small room with a man named TJ, who was a future screenwriter. At that time, TJ made a living by doing odd jobs on Broadway. Through his introduction, Robert Montgomery first appeared on stage, playing a single episode bandit in "The Masked Man," which was a success. He was appreciated by the famous producer George Cukor and met Hollywood stars such as Bette Davis, Ralph Morgan, and Marilyn Hawkins, who had given him five dollars for gambling.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Hu Xueying</p>
<p>After the public screenings of "Baiyun Hometown" [White Cloud Hometown] and "Qiancheng Wanli" [Boundless Future] in Hong Kong resulted in a huge increase in business, they have attracted the attention of filmmakers in the area. It is expected that a large number of similar films will be produced in a short period of time. This is a good phenomenon because, in any case, they are somewhat related to resistance and construction. They are not like the "wooden fish book" and "folk films," which are either about princes in distress or maids disguised, or even demons and monsters, walking corpses, which leave people feeling cold.</p>
<p>Following Cai Chusheng's "Qiancheng Wanli," the second work of the Xinsheng Film Company has been decided to be "Love of the Motherland," directed by Situ Huimin, and will begin filming soon.</p>
<p>Rumors that Jin Xinmin, manager of the Minhua Film Company, will raise one million yuan to establish a large hotel are not true. According to Jin's spokesperson, he has been focusing all his energy on managing Minhua recently, and has not even considered other business ventures.</p>
<p>The play that Minhua is co-producing with the Shanghai Drama School has been tentatively named "Song of Ancient China." The theme is to promote the inherent morality of the nation, and the form is new and different from previous films like "Zhan Jing Tang" [Killing the Classics]. The production attitude has not changed, and they aim to make it a decent "Chinese opera."</p>

Therefore, ticket buyers are very enthusiastic, and seat reservations and exchanges for numbered tickets began on the 3rd.</p>
<p>The singing training class jointly organized by the Shanghai East Commune Women's Youth Association will hold a concert at 7:30 pm on February 1st at the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA.
