<h3>反抗侵略立場堅決　英美不變援華決心　日本向美接洽重開談判　可視爲未來意嚮試金石</h3>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電　星期日泰晤士報外交訪員稱、英國各自治領及美國抵抗日本優略政策任何繼續發展之意嚮、將儘量使日本明瞭之、各民主國之決心已因東條之堅持日本維持其與軸心之連繫而愈見增强、英國駐日大使將早日訪晤日本新首相、闡明英國之正式態度、同時更將探詢內閣更迭對於日本未來外交政策之關係、柬條所發將繼續促進解決中國事件之言論、並不影響英美繼續援助重慶政府之決心、至於日本未來之意嚮、將可視其接洽賡續華盛頓美日談話之情形如何而加以估量云、</p>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電　間人士對於日本現正設法與美國重開談話之消息、頗為注意、認為日本接洽此項談話之手段、將可視作其未來意嚮之試金石、據此間觀察家之判斷、近衛內閣傾倒理由之一、係若干方面對於美日談話之速度及途徑表示不滿、此間一部分人士雖疑慮日本或將乘機山背後襲擊蘇聯、但另一方面對於日新閣向華盛頓之提議則表示歡迎、認為係一種興奮之徵象、及有保持大平洋和平的眞正願望之存在、</p>
<p>路透社十九日華盛頓電　國務院披露星期五日國務卿赫爾與帮辦威爾斯曾與日方副大使若杉晤談頗久、國務院發言人聲稱、雙方曾交換美日關係上一般意見、若干官員相信若杉巳告國務院、柬京內閣雖有變更、然旨在解決美日爭執之談判將繼續進行、</p>
<h3>渝報分析　日本政局　國內有三派鼎立　新閣壽命難久長</h3>
<p>路透社十九日重慶電　中央日報今日載文、審愼分析日木新內閣之性質、斷定東條內閣僅為近衛內閣之延長者、而非為戰爭內閣、故巳注定失敗矣、該文曰、吾人審愼研究東條內閣之人物、可得下列之觀察點、（一）新閣中有多人為前閣員聯任、足徵東條不能覓得相當人物以實各缺、至少四席、此或囚多人不願加入新閣所致、（二）東條奉命組閣之際、日皇召見海相、命海軍與陸軍合作、此足徵日本海陸軍仍相對峙、意氣之不投、一如往日、（三）新閣員十人五人為近衛之閣員、代表近衛平沼强大之勢力、（四）資本家與實業家舉賀屋為藏相、足徵柬條仍處彼等勢力之下、再新外相東鄉為老練之外交家、從未聞共作冒險性之外交、而蘇日之中立協定談判、即由彼開始者也、（五）東條內閣確非戰爭內閣、蓋十人中僅有軍人四、而近衛內閣中則有軍人七、新閣中四軍人、海陸　各二、故吾人敢謂東條內閣乃以軍閥文員財政家合組而成、而無特殊性質、東條內閣不致採與近衛內閣逈異之外交政策、此非强有力之內閣、其壽命不久云、該報之外交訪員謂日本現三派並立、（一）主張籍談判與英美解決爭案者、（二）主張取較積極之行動、或北進或南進者、（三）立於二極端之中間者、東條足以代表之、近衛內閣因與美國談判四十九日而無結果、致為衆不滿而被迫辭職、但日皇與元老皆躊躇不欲將大權交與極端派之手、乃決議命東條組織折中之內閣、繼續努力以求英美之讓步、但近衛內閣所遭遇之梗阻、今仍依然存在、東條內閣之折中政策、經短促壽命後將歸失敗、於是極端份子將處控制政府之地位矣、</p>
<h3>日駐西大使抵葡　討論航空問題</h3>
<p>路透社十九日葡京電　駐西班牙之日大使星期五日由西班牙京城飛抵此間者、將討論關於日本與葡屬蒂摩爾島（在馬來羣島中）闢郵空綫之事宜、按據本週初之消息、葡總理與駐葡日公使已簽定成立此錢之協定、</p>
<h3>葡前總統　戈美斯逝世</h3>
<p>海通社十九日葡京電　曾為葡萄牙總統之戈美期、昨在法屬摩洛哥之勒布吉斯逝世、享壽七十九、</p>
<h3>日新閣外强中乾　外交採兩面政策　緩和美國援助軸心並進　不致對蘇遽作冒險行動</h3>
<p>合衆社十九日華盛頓電　此間昨日咸認東條大將之日本新內閣、將取堅强步驟以保障日本之地位、惟不信日本將立即作進一步之拓展行動、衆測外相東鄉之第一步驟、將企圖對蘇作談判之解決、同時櫃續其華盛頓之遠東問題談話，此問雖未認對蘇術突為絕對不可能能、信日本將先尋求外交之解決云、</p>
<p>路透社十九日華盛頓電　咋　此間各報皆大字皇載日相東條之言論與日副大使若杉訪國務幫之威雨斯士之談話、而以「東京請美國重作和平談話」及「日本援助軸心而擬和綏美國」為標題、星報批評東條之言論、謂日本已明白表示其政府為兩方面的、旣欲束縛美國之手腕、又欲援助希特勒達於極度、東條旣亦其正式言論中、承認渠將使日本與軸心格外密切聯絡、而若杉復向威爾斯轉述日本願重開和平談話之意云、澳政府首相寇丁所發澳政府密切注意各種變化之說、亦甚為各晚報所重視、惟澳政府諭令關於遠東危局之報紙消息、僅以官塲言論為限一層·則各晚報認為頗有意義、</p>
<p>合衆社十九日華盛頓電　「華盛頓星報「昨日之社評稱」除非政治之奇蹟產生、日本巳決意以武士劍、達成其在過東之霸權、非然者、則定實行國家切腹、作為敗北之懲罰、」該報稱、新首相東條英機乃一著名好戰之士、「時機成熟時日本即出以行動、尙有可疑乎、蘇聯在歐洲遭受慘敗之際、日本對西伯利亞之進擊巳迫在眉睫矣、」</p>
<p>日各報著文評論　對新閣期望甚殷</p>
<p>合衆社十九日東京電　日本新首相東條已於昨晚十時赴日本中部之伊勢神宮報告「接任新職、」此舉反映國際局勢之嚴重、渠將于今日返柬京、按照普通手續、首相固于組成新政府後之兩星期內、始首途赴該神宮者也、其他內閣官僚、則將于本週內前往、日文各報一　慶祝新閣之迅速組成、因日本正遭遇前此禾有之危機故也、</p>
<p>路透社十九日東京電　「讀賣新聞」稱、日本新內閣乃日本人民盼望已久可應付日木當前嚴重局勢之內閣、切望新內閣能履行其所因以成立之使命、同時其極力剗除可妨碍日本國策實現之內外各種阻力云、「日日新聞」對於新閣員較　前任內閣僅更易六人一事、加以評論、謂東條前以陸相資格為近衛內閣中之中堅份子、今為新政府之首腦、可見政策不致有何變更云、新商相聲稱、新政府所沿旨在促成東亞繁榮區之邊錢、採取物價低賤之政策云、衆認新內閣之保留前閣文官四人、乃僅為　事便利計、而非因政策關係、首相東條之自兼陸相與內相兩職、大可注意、而東條之任東鄉為外相、殆可視為日本將來外交政策之綫索、蓋駐英大使重光葵刻在東京、有長外交之資格而竟永用也、故若干人相信日本將設法維持北方寗靖而留南方以待將來發展、再不掌部務之閣員鈴木中將現任保留原職、此亦可注意之一點、</p>
<h3>威爾基播音演說　與軸心國勢不兩立　力主廢棄虛偽的中立法　雅納爾亦抨擊日本政策</h3>
<p>路透社十九日紐約電　威爾基頃在「自由奮鬭委員會所發起之全國播音中、發表演說云、美國必須放棄和平之希望、軸心各國現正漸占優勢、吾人苟不從速行動、則將失諸過晚、吾人應勿再自欺、須知柏林羅馬與東京之間、巳為征服世界之危險迷夢所連繫、牢不可破認為一國之勝利、即為全體之勝利、彼等之目的係控制世界、予自由及民洽主義以毀滅、吾人之船隻如不武裝、必將續中魚雷與擊沉　除非吾人以迅速增加之大量貨物、交付予為海陸目由而奮鬭之各國、則軸心之勝利將不能遏止、但即使如此亦尙感不足、吾人必須對於虛偽之中立法加以廢棄、吾人與東京之黷武者及柏林之獨裁者均無談判之餘地、唯有在任何大陸之上每一海洋之中予以制止而己、威氏因患感冒未親自播音、此項演辭係由湯潑生女士代為宣讀、</p>
<p>國際社十九羅特島州普洛微騰電　前美亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾海軍少將今日廣播演辭中、指斥日擴張論者之政策、僅係「籍口」而已、又謂東京之軍人、現正欲目中國戰事中國獲私利、雅氏繼謂、「吾人預料調解美日之無謂努力、現將告終矣」按雅氏素主對日採取强硬政策者，</p>
<p>合衆社十九日紐約電　「紐約時報」昨日選評六、美國無論遭遇何種艱困、決不能放棄其反對日本侵略之立塲、該報言、欲限制暴亂區域不使曼延、及在太平洋上之征服行動、唯一希望　如繼續美國政府之現行政策、該社評警告勿任日本恫嚇美國之政策繼續發展、該報指出美國太平洋艦隊力能收緊經濟壓力、同時且能自美國陸軍中遣幾更多轟炸機至中國、俾對日本內閣任何侵略行動、出以有效之抵抗、論壇先驅報」云「短短之腐收時代現已結束、新的誠實時代即將開始，然此將或使美日關係益趨惡化」「巴爾狄摩太陽報」解釋日本內閣危機、謂乃日本在想份子又勝利、此舉乃孤立之良好敎訓、彼輩嘗反對美國援蘇政策、惟經失收云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>透視今日之日本</h3>
<p>當近衛辭職與東條組閣消息傳布之初，國際間所蒙受的悸動和震驚正不亞於去秋三國同盟之締結。到現在，東條內閣的個性，即在日人亦尙表示「其精確之政治品質尙不十分淸楚」但在其組閣第一聲中，有如閣員陣容的遴選，內外政綱的發布，都還未予人以鹵莽滅裂的印象，反而與某些人士所猜測的「軍人一經登臺，則將改趨保守」的見解相近，準此以觀，則縱然連日有關太平洋的各個方面都極見緊張，却未必不會瞬即轉趨鬆弛，繼日閣改組而起者不一定是南進北進的發動，而或是美日談判的繼續。對蘇外交攻勢的發動。兩日以來，民治國方面已有樂觀見解在萌芽，在某些人的心目中，也許認為目前緊張的太平洋並不難恢復到月餘以前的局勢吧！</p>
<p>日本組閣大命之降到一個現役的少壯軍人身上，這自然可以舉出無數理由，但最主要一點，厥為除此以外，日本今日政治已無他路可走，換句話說，也就是在種種試驗都告失敗之後，不能不投出其最後的一張紙牌。東條是少壯軍人的重心，但他在幹練而外，又是個具有多面性格的軍人；他起草過對中蘇兩面作戰計畫，發動過反英反蘇運動，但他也曾在近衛第二第三兩內閣中耐性的贊助過蘇日中立協定與對美進行談判，他號稱急進，却和「革新派」一流絕少淵源，而且始終只是一個軍人，與軍人而具有强度政治性的小磯柳川建川小林等有所不同。在近來的日本，無疑保守陣容是失敗了，不過任憑急進份子如何叫囂，納粹在外交上如何運用，他們却甯自讓軍人的東條掌政而不肯放中野正剛之流抬頭，足見其對於政局並未放棄最後一步的控制，東條連日所表現者，也許就正是重臣幫對他屬望所在。「二二六」事變後以軍人的林銑十郞組閣，到意外的得到了財閥的合作，其設施也並不比較其前任更走極端，這在日本並不是沒有前例的。</p>
<p>然而事物的本質絕不能僅由其外觀去判斷，尤其今日的日本政局，更不應從一二枝節現象去窺測其全體。儘管東條內閣在人事和政綱上還缺少急進色彩，但即就新閣本身來看，已有若于極可注意的特點。第一，關於刷新日本軍務促進國防生產，在歷任日陸相中以東條致力最大：其隔昨所發布的四項政綱中，「增强國內軍事機構，並動員全國之力量」一項雖列在最後，却可信爲日新閣最主要的中心任務。第二，在近衛失敗了的「新政體制運動」中，本以軍政一元化為其最高理想，現在近衛下台，此一理想亦告完成，只是這不是由政治去統一軍權，而是開始由軍部名實相副的控制了政治。第三，日本內相一職在內政上關係重大，向例是由具有副首相資格的人物去承當，現在東條以首相陸相而更兼內相，集大政及軍事內於一身。在他以外，內閣中絕鮮坚强物、除去軍人，幾乎都是官僚一流，此在政制上爲極權的形態，對內部則加强軍權對一切的控制。凡此種種，用意原極簡單，只是效法納粹，把全國一切趕速形成一個適於戰爭的機構。這一趨勢絕不是其溫和外觀所能遮蓋的。</p>
<p>那麼，又何以在表面上並未表現出劍拔弩張之態呢？第一，因為準備不充分，一年以來「建立高度國防體制運動」只是犧牲人民生活上最低限度的享受去硬使輕工業佔優勢的日本走上發展重工業之途，但是因為受到資源人力不足與國際經濟重壓的緣故。和平產業極端萎縮了，戰爭工業的成績也並不良好，像美國在今年連續完成四艘三萬五千噸主力艦的奇蹟，在日本是無從夢見的。第二，要佇候適當時機，蘇聯固未一敗塗地。美國也尙未眞正臨到兩面作戰的危機，如此而對外遽採行動姿態，只有更刺激對方使之加强戒備。而第三，最重要的，在戰略上也還需要取得比較有利　形勢，如果目前立即南進或攻蘇，則日本所遭際者必難免是在四面包圍之中作戰，即使東條是對中蘇兩面作戰的倡導者，在目前形勢下也不能不有所踟躕。在其理想中，必須這一包圍陣勢有一面或兩面的打開纔能試行冒險。以是乃一面以有親蘇之目的東鄉任外相，一面由若杉對美提出繼續談判的要求，而在其四項政綱中，又首先就提出了對「中國事變」的解決。</p>
<p>林銑十郞內閣曾經是個在形態上比較溫和的內閣，在事實上却正形成了中日爆發的階梯，這一往事正是世人所應加以最大警惕的。</p>

<h3>格拉第遄返舊金山　預籌滬美航綫　計劃如何越過代管島嶼　視時局推移定各輪行止</h3>
<p>美國總統輪公司所屬輪隻、將停航遠東一說、尚未獲華盛頓總行任何電報、惟以國務院幫辦格拉第曾於八月十　日來遠東視察、研究經濟情形外、允注重於戰事一旦發生後之航行輪雙問題、衆信太平洋萬　惡化、格拉第現任美總統輪公司總經理之職、此次來遠東、對此必有全盤考慮也、</p>

<p>現在駛程</p>
<p>美總統各輪、就目前所　航行路程、已避免於來滬時、途經日本口岸改道馬尼刺香港來滬後返美、最近來滬如柯立芝總統輪、以及九月二十三日來滬之批亞士總統輪、及克利扶總統輪、悉取道馬尼刺香港來滬、僅於返美時由滬經日領海返舊金山、此種步驟、蓋依照原有航程之辦法、但萬一太平洋上有所舉動時、此綫航程、尚不能計策安全、航商正在躊躇中、</p>
<p>美方躊躇</p>

<p>新輪來滬</p>
<p>美國總統輪船公司所定船期、於十一月底以前、將有總統輪干　艘駛來上海、六月十六日美航務委員會雖徵用柯立芝·克利扶·塔虎脫·傑克遜·阿當·等七總統輪外、其命令塡缺者、增至十二艘之多、苟美總統輪總公司無特別命令前、小致變更、本月二十七日前、由香港回程抵滬者、有泰勒總統輪、由舊金山處女航加入遠東航行者有范倍倫總統輪、據新聲社記者探悉、白禮士將軍號定十一月一日抵滬、十一月十七日有好勃魯克將軍號由滬駛舊金山、又巴拿馬輪普立達號雖於三日前離滬、但悉該輪可望重行駛來上海、</p>

<h3>滬甬輪客廖廖</h3>
<p>義商實利輪被扣釋放後、該輪即租給中華輪船公司、更名爲華林、本定十八日首途航駛、滬甬綫、後因手續未妥、故未如期開出、茲悉該輪已定於二十二日駛甬、該輪噸位、校原有行駛該綫之鳴門萬吉超過二倍以上、故聞該輪正式聞航後、萬吉輪將退出另駛他綫、又悉有浙東輪船公司租賃之海通及大華兩輪、亦已加入滬甬綫、乘客極少</p>
<h3>免費種痘運動　定期開始</h3>

<h3>中國內衣織染廠</h3>

<h3>參觀中國內衣織染廠記</h3>
<p>— 努</p>
<p>近二十年來，我國織布業，蒸蒸日上，即上海一隅，亦工廠林立，不幸戰事發生，被燬者什之七八，惟中國內衣織染廠，得保持完整，因國內外需要殷切，故生產量日增，營業益臻發達。</p>
<p>該廠成立於民九，由留美紡織專家現任總經理黃鴻鈞君所發起組織。二十餘年來，專心經營，而巳成爲今日中國唯一之自織自染自漂自縫之偉大工廠矣。</p>
<p>廠址在康腦脫路，佔地二十餘畝，計分織布·漂染·縫衣三大部，織布部內分搖紗·經紗。穿紗·漿缸·整理等間，有布機五百六十五部，每部附有自動馬達一只，每日可出一千七百餘疋。漂染部亦置有最新之設備。內有燒平機·蒸缸·漂桶·染缸·烘缸車·拉闊車·軋光車·碼布車等。每日可漂白及染色布二千餘疋。縫衣部設在另一廠屋樓上，見各種機械，以電氣剪刀裁衣，能同時裁剪數十層之斜紋厚布，式樣旣正確，而工作又迅速；衣料剪成後，交與女工縫紉，其所用奢爲電力車衣機，形式雖與平常所見之縫衣機相同，惟每只機下，裝置小馬達，用足一踏，可隨意開關。據云，每日可出ABC內衣一百餘打，雨衣數十打，並出衣褲相聯之雙聯。（即衫聯褲），爲該廠獨家出品，以其備有特殊之雙聯機耳。</p>
<p>機器房內，備各種母機，宛如一機器工廠。發電機間，全部馬達發動，每日須燃煤十八噸。右有水廠，以電力吸取井水後，管入水池，此處宛如一自來水廠。其他爲堆棧。包裝間·裝璜問等。綜觀全部工塲，規模宏大，佈置井然，實爲我國罕見之織染廠。至其出品，有內衣布·絨布·陰丹士林布·黃斜紋布·直貢呢·嗶嘰·及雨衣布等五十餘種，行銷全國及南洋各地。</p>
<p>廠之發行所在南京路，並設百貨商塲，除推銷本廠出品外，尚售日用品及西裝。總經理黃君，爲作進一步之擴充計，早於民國二十六年，在崑山茶葭浜蘇州河旁，購進廠地四百餘畝，擬分三區建設，如大型工廠區及職工住宅區，餘地按照股東股份大小，分配與各股東，作爲股東住宅模範村等。該廠向前邁進，前途未可限量。</p>

<h3>前面紅燈駕車小心　爲新創銀行進一言</h3>
<p>— 奇</p>
<p>銀行有如婚姻介紹所。婚姻介紹所的任務是代人執柯，並非以自己去應廣男怨女的需要。如果以自己去應曠男怨女需要的，這不是婚姻介紹所而是男妓院。</p>
<p>銀行以撮合社會游資（等於怨女）和對於資本的需要（等於曠男）爲職責，使之各得其所，並非替自己開方便之鬥。此時此地，游資充斥，原屬勢所當然。然何以游資充斥而竟成爲當然現象奢？就因此時此地，對於資本，根本沒有正當需要。邇來各銀行之紛紛减息，足證各旣設銀行經營業務土之苦悶。只有曠男，或只有怨女，婚姻介紹所就無事可爲。如果男多女少，或男少女多，月下老人也無法克盡厥責的。如誠心爲人作伐的婚姻介紹所，在此塲合，只應减少，決無增設之理。除非他想利用怨女之需要，自充男妓以遂其玩弄女性之獸慾。以之喻此時此地新銀行之有如雨後春筍，吾不禁爲一般怨女担心。</p>
<p>本文係專對誠心爲人作伐之新銀行家而作，並非以男妓爲目標。如係男姣，則爲獸性所包圍，實已無理可喻。作者爲銀行界中人，就其所論各點，皆以銀行業務爲出發，又以銀行業務爲歸宿。語語中肯，句句着實，揭微抉要，發人猛省。情摯意懇，盡爲新創銀行設想。要非權成銀行家，曷克言此？編者敢爲讀者吿，作者爲當代著名銀行家之一，文下署名限署於文下而已。古語云：忠言逆耳良藥苦口。然有識者，則不致河漢斯言。（編者）</p>

<p>以上僅就筆奢所知，列入表內，其已籌備尚未舉行創立會者，或已在發起而未就緒者，不知尚有若干家數。姑以上述情形觀之，亦可見新創銀行之多，實爲空前未有之現象。然而環顧事實：目前上海市塲情形怎樣？是吾需要如許銀行？能吾容納如許銀行？而這許多銀行的產生，是不是爲着產業發達？能不能發育滋長？在市面畸形發展的今日，吾人實有未能已於言者。</p>
<p>存放相左　消化不良</p>
<p>上海市面的繁榮，看來日甚一日；然而揆諸實際，產業並不發達，貿易並不興旺，這種表面的繁榮，無疑的不是經濟正常發展，不過是戰時一種特殊現象。試就目前市面分析一下：造成市面繁榮的因素，第一是人口　集，淪陷區人民，仍是滯留滬上；第二是海外游資集中，各國統制匯兌結果，海外資金紛向上海市塲移動；第三是幣值下跌，物價暴漲，各業無往而小獲利；第四是投機市塲活躍，暴富戶層出不窮。因爲有這幾種因子來撑持市面，所以上海市面一方面在蓬蓬勃勃，一方面却鬧着資余過剩。在這種塲合之下，銀行的運用資金，也首先遭遇空前難關。大量放款，在這時局動盪之中，旣不敢多做；小額透支，工商業亦甚少需要；至若囤積貨物，目前貨價業已登峯造極，誰敢冒此風險？銀行處此時艱，應付當然不易。政府銀行緊縮業務，因爲環境關係，或許例外。但是商業銀行一向是靠着存放度日，放款旣不能多做，亦惟有從存款上打點算盤，所以最近商業銀行需要一再减息，對於存款施行種種限制。這種不歡迎存款的反常處置，也正所以表示目前銀行運用存款，困難已極，不得不設法减低存款，以輕負担。雖然：銀行存款的增加，是受了市面繁榮之賜；但是銀行業務够不上繁榮，也徒使銀行患起消化不良病狀。這種現象，究非銀行前途之福</p>
<p>動機各殊　冒險則一</p>
<p>目前上海的市面如此，銀行　處境又如此，而何以新興銀行，不避艱險，依然蠭起雲湧，其故何在？原因是：</p>
<p>（一）營業員想過經理的癮一般銀行或錢莊營業員，平日寄人籬下，不易騰達；於是乘目前游資充斥之際，在各方拉攏之下，組織銀行，實現其做經理的念頭。</p>
<p>（二）舊銀行不給存息　目前商業銀行對於活期存款，大多不結利息；而放款利息則仍在月息一分左右；在表面上一存一欠，即有年息一分以上之利益。如此便宜，千載難逢；於趁引起各方創辦銀行的興趣。</p>
<p>（三）暴富戶的衆多　最近由於投機市塲活躍，囤積貨物盛行，產生了許多暴富戶；此輩每於茶餘酒後，在片刻閒談中，便可組織銀行，認足股額。</p>
<p>（四）工商業自辦銀行　工商業鑒於以往與銀行往來，事事仰人鼻息；目前各業營業鼎盛，資金充沛，於是自辦銀行；一方面爲自己資金活動之餘地，一方面爲工商業揚眉吐氣。</p>
<p>（五）以銀行爲光榮事業　銀行爲百業之首，做銀行似乎覺得榮耀；並且可以藉此號召。一般想辦事業者，因此多改辦銀行。</p>
<p>（六）政府寬容政策　上海環境特殊，政府又遠在西南，鞭長英及；對於新興銀行呈請騐資註册等事，過於寬鬆；祗要有證明文件，便可核准註册，頒發執照；故創辦銀行手續，反較以前簡易尤多。</p>
<p>從以上各種因索觀之：可知新銀行的突起，並不是眞正由於環境的需要，乃是一般人視銀行爲時髦事業，大家都想冒險的嘗試一下。以這種心理來創辦銀行，前途的成敗，誠令人不堪想像。</p>
<h3>名目五花八門　業務不脫陳軌</h3>
<p>新銀行的產生，旣簡日易，家數之多，自在意中，此區區租界一隅，忽增加如許之銀行，營業上難免不起競爭？惟新銀行究非老銀行可比，若無特殊性質，不足以廣招徠，這些新銀行的性質究竟如何？從他們的業務上可以明瞭。考銀行主要業務：是辦理存款收付，承做各種放款，及經營信託事項項；在目前商業銀行中，大率千篇一律，並無特殊區別，但是在這些新興銀行中，有稱商業銀行，有稱鐵業銀行，有稱烟業銀行，亦有稱實業銀行；名目繁多，花樣百出；他們的業務，在商業銀行，是經營商業兼辦儲蓄信託業務，當然與一般商業銀行無異；而在專業銀行，顧名思義，其業務範圍，是應以某一業爲限；但是一窺實際，這些專業銀行仍不脫商業銀行性質，並未達到其專業的地步。即使專業銀行耍做到業務專業化，在中國金融現狀下，一時也未必就能辦到；中國已有之專業銀行，如興業，實業，墾業，鹽業，等爲數並不少，可是經過數十年的奮鬥，業務還未逕到專業目的。這些新興的專業銀行，當然史談不到，所以論起新創銀行的性質，並無特殊之處，與商業銀行亦無二致，雖然有此專業爲標榜，亦不過藉此號召，及在銀行界中增加許多專業銀行名詞而已。</p>
<p>如有路老　銀行佔先</p>
<p>銀行是個營業機關，靠着做生意以維持生存，新銀行旣無特殊性質，他的業務範圍，當然與老銀行並無二樣，然而在目前情形之下，老銀行的業務，是一天一天的緊縮：限制存款，减少放款，抑低存息，節省開支；這種現象，均足以表示銀行對外不能發展，惟有對內設法補救：老銀行情形如此，新銀行又何能例外？而且新銀行信用未孚，營業上的困難，祇有較老銀行格外加重，以下事實，可資佐證：</p>
<p>存欵</p>
<p>目前市面上游資充斥，銀行吸收存款，似乎並不困難：這在老銀行方面，因爲本着已有之　譽，可以招徠存款，却有此種感想。但是在新銀行方面，一則本身信用未著，二則新開銀行過多；欲吸收大量存款，究非易事，因此新銀行因爲吸收存款不易，往往引起同業競爭；因爲同業競爭，往往會　生放盤吸收存款的現象。</p>
<p>放欵</p>
<p>放款爲銀行主要業務，亦爲銀行利仔所在；如無特殊原因，豈肯輕易放棄？目前老銀行之不敢大量放款，當然有其內在的因素，亦爲新銀行所共同感覺的。而且就銀行放款時情形而言：壞的戶頭，銀行根本不敢往來；好的戶頭，在平時而寸小缺，銀行要他用款，反須買過交悄；在目前好戶頭依然用款很少，即使偶爾缺少頭寸，向銀行通融，亦得先與銀行講講條件，決不至飢不探食；故在此情形之下，銀行的放款，可以說大半是借款人市面。借款的條件；是由借款人來開的；老銀行的顧客尚且如此，新銀行爲推廣營業，對待顧客，恐怕更須遷就，這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>其他</p>
<p>在非常時期中，銀行所經營的業務，除存放之外，還有外滙，內匯，公債，股票，地產，貨物等；過去各銀行從這方面生財的，却也不少；但是這種生財之道，或因市塲沒落，或因變化狹小，或因市價業已登峯造極；目前小是門路閉塞，即是風險重重；已爲一般銀行視爲畏途。假如新銀行仍舊去做，恐怕不但不能拾人吐餘，或許弄得得不償失。</p>
<p>鉅額費用　何處塡補</p>
<p>所以目前銀行的業務，日眞趨狹窄；老銀行所不能做的，新銀行未必能做。而且老銀行不是傻子，有錢不賺；新銀行也未必獨具隻眼，生財有道。生意上的困難，新舊銀行是無分彼此的。</p>
<p>目前時局動盪不定，物價飛漲無已，而銀行業務不能跟着發展：要要維持一家銀行開支，却是相當困難；尤其是新創的銀行，在經常費之外，尚須費一筆巨大開辦費；這兩筆費用，出自何處？頗值得討論一下。</p>
<h3>開辦费越来越大</h3>
<p>銀行在開幕之前，第一年鉅大支出，便是房屋及裝修等費；銀行房屋不但須整齊美觀，並且應在市面中心地帶；目前上海中心市區，行號櫛比，幾無隙地；其能適合爲銀行行址者，更寥寥無幾，新銀行爲解決行址問題，不惜以巨額頂費號召，覺得優越整齊之房屋；因此頂費愈抬愈高，銀行開辦費亦愈界愈大；就目前情形而論；一家新銀行所費的頂費裝修費等，在十萬元二十萬元者，不足爲奇。假若銀行的資本不過一百萬元，则未開幕之前，流動資金已打了八折或九折，新銀行是否負担得起？却是一個嚴重問題。</p>
<h3>經常費如何著落</h3>
<p>近來物價飛漲，生活程度日高；銀行的經常開支亦隨着龐大。銀行爲一種服務社會事業，開支究未能過份節省省；以小規模銀行而言，以最省開支計算，每月經費恐不能少於二萬五千元，每年亦不能少於三十萬元。試問這三十萬元的開支，從何處取償？吾人不妨分析一下：銀行原靠着存放度日，以存放款利息的差金，來抵銷開支；新銀行是不能像老銀行不給利息，或酌給利息；所以他存放利息的差額，恐柏亦不過在三厘左右。假定存款是一千萬元，放款亦是一千萬元，則收支差足相抵，但是事實上所收的存款，不能悉數放出；而且時局飄忽不定，存款活期居多；銀行多少　須留點準備。如一千萬存款留五百萬作爲準備，則五百萬營運的收入，顯然的是不够開支。</p>
<p>以上不過就中等銀行來說，五十萬元規模的小銀行，或二百萬元規模的大銀行，其情形尤不止於此。姑就最簡單的營業上一盈一虧　算，目前確已捉襟見肘，將來如何長久維持？誠令人百思不得其解。</p>
<p>創辦時興冲冲　研究後呆瞪瞪</p>
<p>從　次新開銀行創辦時情形觀之，創辦人興高采烈，投資者踴躍參加，表面上似乎做銀行却有多大利益。然而細細研究起來，銀行處境日艱，業務無從開拓！開支日見浩大，盈虧如何彌補？前途困難重重，辦銀行也不是一件容易事業，而且目前大局未定，市面浮華，在風暴雨，隨時可襲；新銀行立足，偶一不穩，即有傾覆之虞，所以在如此環境之下，新銀行的唯一生路，亦惟有穩定基礎，徐圖前進，而穩定基礎最重要的法門」是：（一）生意不能濫做，（二）開支應力求節省，固然，在新銀行創辦之初，生意不能不求多做；物價高漲之際，開支無法可省；做起來却有相當困難。不過道兩難的情形，亦祇有看各銀行如何自決？筆者不過揭發事實，分析利害；新銀行家不乏精明之士，當能善於應付。</p>

<h3>青年會主辦　孝親徵文比賽有感</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>上海靑年會少年組，從上年起，規定上月份爲「孝親月」，今年循例舉行「孝親徵文比賽」，這的確是很有意義的。我們對於這發揚固有道德的舉措，自然十分同情而樂予贊助的。孝親本來是一種美德，每個人無論在幼年中年，甚至老年，父母在，必盡　孝道。父母心理上有所煩悶，精神上有所痛苦；或者經濟上有所需要；爲子女者應盡力設法解除，以安父母之心，這是爲人處世立身行道第一個條件。倘使一個人對父母不能盡其孝道，我可以斷定這個人對人羣社會，國家，決沒有偉大的建樹。自古以來，史蹟流傳，不一而足。你想：生我育我的第一恩人是父母，不孝父母，便是忘本！忘本的人，還了得麼？但我人於孝道之外，應得辨別知愚與是非，假定父母做出什麼大逆不道的行爲，子女也該直言相諫，免得貽禍將來，所以孝道也得尺度，愚孝是萬萬要不得的。</p>
<p>英國幽默犬師蕭伯納對於扶養子女，曾有一種見解。他以爲父母扶育子女是替社會作一種投資，將來應該由社會向這些子女索回他們應付的酬報，我以爲道見解的確是不能再好，那末我們在孝親的時候，擴大範圍而爲社會服務，豈不更好？</p>
<p>如果我們自己已經做了父母，那末我們更應當努力修養，創造合理的家庭生活，吾則我們怎可以把優美的性格，遺傳給我們的子女呢。</p>
<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3>徵文揭曉之三　我的續絃問題</h3>
<p>— 無雙</p>
<p>相處三年，臥病白日的妻，終於悄然永別了。遺下的是人事未通的三歲幼兒。一方面是形單影隻的丈夫，一方面是寂寞孤零的爸爸，這樣又是一百多天了。</p>
<p>雖然母親從鄉下趕來照應我的飲食起居！帶養這可憐的孩子。一個問題顯然地橫在面前：「續絃」。</p>
<p>從妻逝世不多久起，就有許多親戚朋友來跟母親談，跟我談做媒了。這無論如何是好意，然而在我這一方面，父母只有我一個兒子，孩子也只有我這一個最疼愛他的人，自己早先原是極有雄心的人，道雄心雖因爲從學校進入社會以後，於世道人心稍有理解而逐漸减縮，也還想乘此尚具精力的時候奮鬥一下，家庭自是需要一個的。祗是如何組成道個家庭，便很值得考慮。</p>
<p>有人說：「你是續絃，選擇配偶，應該將就些」。按妻的對於丈夫，原是得意時的臂助，失意時的安慰，終身的伴侶，唯一的知心，什麼事可以將就，選擇配偶，可以將就麼</p>
<p>又有人說：「娶妻的第一個條件，要性悄好」。是的，爲了我的孩子，新的妻性情自然要好，雖不能待孩子如他的生母一般，總不能虐待他，歧視他，實際上又有幾個做後母的不虐待或者歧視孩干的呢？十個做媒的就有九個牛要說這家姑娘性情好的，可是結婚以後，也許待人性情好的，待你會性情不好，待你性情好的，待孩子會性情不好，那時候就「悔之晚矣」。</p>
<p>又有人說：「找合於自己理想的配偶，須到外面去交際」。誠然，情塲徵逐，多少對美滿夫妻俱是由此而成！如說我，就沒有這麼好的興緻。而且，雖然受的是最新的敎育，總覺得自己是一個中國人，對於最新的交際方式，男女的觀念，不大表示贊同。</p>
<p>這樣便只靠人家的「做媒」了。然而男女問題而到「做媒」的階段，去結婚即不遠了。而我的意思是想由此而謀相互的認識，過了相當時期，再談婚姻。「認識」不是「允諾」，我不能隨便答應，可是做媒的那末誠意，被做媒的又那未認眞，我又怕誤了人家的靑春。</p>
<p>於是我的方法，便只限於初見時的印象，甚至於對方的一紙照片，媒人的幾句介紹爲根據，這不更是太難了麼？</p>
<p>一個自然科學的問題，我可以應用公式，檢查表格，解決得了。一個國際問題，我也可以參考書籍，諮詢專家，做得出一個答案。祇是一個「續絃」的問題，我可無法解答。</p>
<p>想起亡妻的音容，撫着孩子的圓臉，我猛地意會我還年靑，這個問題還是等幾時再說罷。（酬充申報讀者助學金）</p>
<p>編者按</p>
<p>無雙先生能彀把他的續絃問題，考慮得這樣周密，父盡力地爲着他的孩子着想，眞是難能可貴。我很希望他能彀繼續用他冷靜的頭腦，熱烈的父愛，去選擇他未來的配偶。</p>
<p>我不知道無雙先生的已經去世的夫人，是不是由，做媒而結婚的，夫婦間情感如何。在第二决結婚的時候，至少可以免去第一决結婚的錯誤。美國的婚姻專家在考查結婚生活是否美滿的時候，往往會提出這麼一個問題：「如果你再度結婚你是否將知你現在的妻子一樣的人結合」，眞可以請無雙先生自問一下。</p>
<p>在現代選擇配偶實在是應該愼重的，最好能彀在幾個女性之中，選擇一個（女子選擇丈夫，也得用相同的方式），單憑一紙照相和一决的會面是太危險了。</p>
<p>現在頗有許多人提倡相識和訂婚的距離時間要長，訂婚和結婚相隔的時間要短，山額夫人就是有這種主張的一個。至於正式的社交，是很高尚的，無雙先生，似乎不宜固執</p>
<p>最後，我很爲無雙先生對於他的孩子的摯愛而感動。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>將猪肉或牛肉斬細，做成肉糜，俗稱「千刀肉。」有些人不知爲什麼原故，生平不吃千刀肉；其實千刀肉沒有什麼不好吃，並且容易消化；而有許多菜和點心，也少不了千刀肉的。譬如菜心蟹粉獅子頭，肉末豆腐，薯泥牛肉餅，燒買，湯包，湯糰，水餃，鍋貼等等，都是很可口的菜肴和點心，不吃豈不可惜！在這米珠薪桂的時代，有肉吃已很幸福，切不可再揀精嫌肥的多所挑剔，一個家庭中，凡是做丈夫的，都應該知道這一點，免得使主持中饋的妻子，更增加了每天配菜的困難。</p>

<h3>（一三九）大炙蟹</h3>
<p>— 許養楨擬稿</p>
<p>預備…紫蘇　生薑　鎭江醋</p>
<p>製法…大炙蟹的煮法是最普通，不過有幾點應該注意的，煮時要放紫蘇以解其毒，蟹肚臍上嵌一片生薑以驅其寒，在煮蟹之前應該把蟹用蔴繩紮住，綑成一個五花大綁，煮的時候不要把蟹浸在水中，應該用一蒸架，或是用篾竹的黃籃頭架起來，把蟹放在上面蒸熟，如此煮法就不致因蟹浸着水而失去鮮味，吃的時候，不要忘記了鎭江醋和生薑末。</p>
<h3>（一四〇）豬肉嵌蟹</h3>
<p>— 曹馥錕擬稿</p>

<p>佳英女士：你的姊夫正在受孤寂的痛苦，自然他很需要你做伴侶。但是佳英女士，你處於現在的地位，應該要多用你的理智，不可以情感用事，因爲你實在舉足輕重，不是目前的事，而有關你今後幾十年的事情。你和你的　夫旨趣方面如何，性情是吾相合，年齡相差多少，如果結婚，能不能有美滿的結婚生活，這些都是你應該考慮的事情，如果你們有結婚的價值，自然也未曾不可，但也須經過正當的手續，使你有確切的保障，決不可被情感掩住了你的理智。萬一你認爲沒有結婚的可能，那末你可以向你的姊夫開誠地說明你的苦衷，請他以愛你姊姊的熱情，尊重你的意志。</p>
<p>乖乖女士，你和你的異母姊姊有很好的情感，很好，但你也不必重形式，不妨隨時看機會，何必急急，同時你可以用適富的方法，解除她和你母親中間的惡感。</p>

<h3>救一個可憐的孩子</h3>
<p>— 畏三</p>
<p>每天收到讀者許多來信，從來不肯忽略過，細小的問題，都隨時解決了。最令我們中心悲痛而又難以解決的，是一般貧困讀者的呼籲，不理罷，受着良心上的譴責，要去幫助他們罷，又沒有妥善的辦法，往往有若干困難的事件，擱在桌上，看了誠懇悲傷的來信，反來覆去，終於不忍輕易地掉入字紙麓中，結果每就個人棉力所及，分別設法，有些特懇友人幫助，有些指點一個塗徑。</p>
<p>昨夜有一位讀者來信說，在去年春天，鄰人送來一僩生甫數月的男孩，經他們夫婦收養，非常歡喜，每天用奶粉哺育，現在漸漸長大了，伶俐活潑，甚是可愛。這孩子不幸於最近生病了，中西醫都請遍，藥方積至數十張，可以訂成一本小賬簿。這護者經濟原極困難，化了一筆鉅大的醫藥費，已羅掘俱窮，靴以支持；現在孩子的病，日有起色，但是他絕對無力再負擔診治的醫藥費，所以希望我們想法，救救一個可憐的孩子。他說，他不忍一個活潑的孩子，走了很短的人生歷程，便結束了生命。</p>
<p>我們爲他感動了，經過一番考慮，不欲公開向讀者呼籲，已請一位素負聲望的醫生，去解決這個難題。我們和醫生的定，醫藥費完全免收，蜴力簪孩子診治，不過這位向我們呼籲的讀者，他的境况究竟如何，是必須調查淸楚的。</p>
<p>救一個孩子不難，但是如何去救無其數的「貧而無吿」的人呢？我們這樣想。</p>
<h3>本地風光　「走油」</h3>
<p>— 蔡杰楝</p>
<p>這裹是什麼地方？是油市塲。近來，生活越弄越困難，連起碼東西的大餅油條也要賣到一角一件，並且是越來越小了，這就是經過這裹而造成的局面：</p>
<p>「自然！市面還要漲，空頭尷尬，哈哈哈！」</p>
<p>「再漲漲到幾時！？走油走油，不得了！」</p>
<p>「只有買進，沒有買出，還下得落手？市面要不得了。」</p>
<p>於是大街小巷多的是買油者。</p>
<p>不多久才賣一元多點一斤，不幾日很快的升到二元幾角，日有限制，說多買賣不來，無非是以資調節的一派話。而出二元幾角買來的油，竟大異於一元多點的，油色褐黃，渾淘淘的，不知和過什麼。內行的說是攙淸油，淸油就是花汕，說得再通俗點，就是棉子油，是最劣等的，向來不大有人吃，然有什麼法子呢？</p>
<p>這時也有主持公道的出來說話了，這幾乎是老規矩，不還是你管你說我管我做？誰好管？眼前是非常時期，比不得平時。另一方面，袞袞諸公自己淘里却起鬥爭，這是發生在多頭與空頭間，多頭貪得無饜空頭倫鷄不着，要蝕多少把米是還在未定之天。空頭顯然有點吃不消，要掛「免戰牌」這當兒，多頭氣勢正盛，怎肯罷休？這怎麼好？也是不得了！</p>
<p>一天，市塲門口。忽然有異常的發現。……市塲方面爲求安全計，遂通吿禁止大家賣空買空，勸雙方讓步。不知怎樣一來，忽有說這完全是空頭方面的鬼計，也許多頭心裏不甘，又堅持起來。</p>
<p>不要管他們吧！大多數人都在嘆息着：</p>
<p>「人越弄越難做了！」</p>
<p>大多數人受少數人的搬弄，然而這世界不是屬於少數人的。天不會永遠不亮，有一天，人是會好做的。</p>
<h3>安全第一</h3>
<p>— 葛亮</p>
<p>一個女孩子懇切地問她的祖父的年齡，得到一個滿意的答復，又問他有沒有牙齒。</p>
<p>「有的，」</p>
<p>「唔！」</p>
<p>「可是只有幾隻了，並且那些牙齒已不中用了。」</p>
<p>「可以嚼硬的東西嗎？」</p>
<p>「不行不行，軟的食物上口後，也要咀嚼許多時候才能嚥下去呢，怎麼……」</p>
<p>「那麼，公公，這裏的包長生果代我保管一下，好嗎？」</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十三　流浪到上海</p>
<p>「孩子，南京固然也是好地方，但比起上海來，終究還差一些。咱們別再三心兩意啦！」因爲梅賽想在到達南京以後，找一個適當的團體加入工作，或是進傷兵醫院去充看護；一方面維持生活，一方而爲國家出一分心力。但秋海棠却認爲不怎樣妥當，便在離開徐州以前，又再三的向她解說。</p>
<p>自從出了尚老二的那件事，梅寳對於她父親便格外孝順了，聽他這樣說了幾遍，也就不再堅持要留在南京。</p>
<p>「祗要爸爸願意去，我總跟着你！」</p>
<p>「我想上海那邊不比南京，多少我還有幾個熟人，也並不是我一定歡喜那個地方。」秋海棠想起了從前那些遺老名十的拚命給自己捧塲，心裏多少兜起了一些希望；當然，他並不希望人家再像從前那樣的送行頭，送鑽戒，寫稿子在捧，甚至把自己的照片嵌在　　　　　，可是他想祗要這中間有一個人，能够把從而那樣的好意，再用百分之一分來，那末他和梅寳的生活就不成問題了。</p>
<p>要我生活總是揀容易的路走的，眞像飛蛾一定要望亮處撲一樣。</p>
<p>隔不到牛個月，秋海棠父女倆使流浪到這一個世界聞名的大都市中來了？但秋海棠的衣袋裏，却已僅僅的剩了十一塊錢。（二四〇）（十三章完）</p>

<h3>Resolute Stance Against Aggression: Britain and America's Unwavering Resolve to Aid China; Japan Contacts the U.S. to Reopen Negotiations: A Litmus Test for Future Intentions</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent stated that the UK and its Dominions, as well as the United States, intend to make clear to Japan their opposition to any continued development of its policy of encroachment. The determination of the democratic nations has been strengthened by Tojo's insistence that Japan maintain its ties with the Axis powers. The British Ambassador to Japan will soon meet with the new Japanese Prime Minister to clarify Britain's official stance and, at the same time, inquire into the relationship between the change of cabinet and Japan's future foreign policy. Tojo's statement that he will continue to promote the resolution of the China Incident does not affect the determination of Britain and America to continue aiding the Chongqing government. As for Japan's future intentions, they can be assessed by how it approaches the continuation of the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – Insiders are paying close attention to the news that Japan is currently seeking to reopen talks with the United States, considering Japan's approach to these talks as a litmus test for its future intentions. According to observers here, one of the reasons for the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet was dissatisfaction from some quarters regarding the speed and direction of the U.S.-Japan talks. While some here suspect that Japan may take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, others welcome the new Japanese cabinet's proposal to Washington as an encouraging sign and an indication of a genuine desire to maintain peace in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – The State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Hull and Assistant Secretary Welles met with Japanese Deputy Ambassador Wakasugi for a considerable time on Friday. A State Department spokesman stated that the two sides exchanged general views on U.S.-Japan relations. Some officials believe that Wakasugi informed the State Department that, despite the cabinet change in Tokyo, negotiations aimed at resolving the U.S.-Japan dispute will continue.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Analysis: Japan's Political Situation - Three Factions Stand Opposed Domestically; New Cabinet's Lifespan Unlikely to be Long</h3>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 19th – The Central Daily News today published an article, cautiously analyzing the nature of Japan's new cabinet, concluding that the Tojo Cabinet is merely an extension of the Konoe Cabinet, not a war cabinet, and is therefore destined to fail. The article states: "Upon careful study of the figures in the Tojo Cabinet, the following observations can be made: (1) Many members of the new cabinet are reappointments from the previous cabinet, indicating that Tojo was unable to find suitable individuals to fill the vacancies, at least four of them. This may be because many people were unwilling to join the new cabinet. (2) When Tojo was ordered to form a cabinet, the Emperor summoned the Minister of the Navy and ordered the Navy to cooperate with the Army. This indicates that the Japanese Navy and Army are still in opposition, their intentions not aligned as before. (3) Five of the ten new cabinet members were members of the Konoe cabinet, representing the forces of Konoe, Hiranuma, and Kido. (4) The appointment of Kaya as Minister of Finance by capitalists and industrialists indicates that Tojo is still under their influence. Furthermore, the new Foreign Minister Togo is an experienced diplomat, and he has never been known to engage in adventurous diplomacy, and he initiated the negotiations for the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. (5) The Tojo Cabinet is definitely not a war cabinet, as only four out of ten members are military personnel, while the Konoe Cabinet had seven military personnel. Of the four military personnel in the new cabinet, two are from the Navy and two are from the Army. Therefore, we dare to say that the Tojo Cabinet is composed of military figures, civilian officials, and financiers, and has no special character. The Tojo Cabinet will not adopt a foreign policy that is radically different from that of the Konoe Cabinet. This is not a strong cabinet, and its lifespan will not be long." The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that there are currently three factions in Japan: (1) Those who advocate resolving disputes with Britain and the United States through negotiations; (2) Those who advocate taking more active action, either northward or southward; (3) Those who stand in the middle of the two extremes, which Tojo represents. The Konoe Cabinet was forced to resign due to dissatisfaction with the 49 days of negotiations with the United States without results. However, the Emperor and the elder statesmen hesitated to hand over power to the extremist faction, and decided to order Tojo to form a compromise cabinet to continue efforts to seek concessions from Britain and the United States. However, the obstacles encountered by the Konoe Cabinet still exist. The Tojo Cabinet's compromise policy will fail after a short life, and then the extremist elements will be in control of the government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Spain Arrives in Portugal to Discuss Aviation Issues</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 19th – The Japanese Ambassador to Spain, who flew here from the capital of Spain on Friday, will discuss matters relating to the establishment of a postal air route between Japan and Portuguese Timor Island (in the Malay Archipelago). According to news earlier this week, the Portuguese Prime Minister and the Japanese Minister to Portugal have signed an agreement to establish this route.</p>

<h3>Japan's New Cabinet is Weak Externally but Strong Internally; Adopts a Two-Faced Diplomatic Policy: Simultaneously Seeking Rapprochement with the U.S. and Aiding the Axis; Unlikely to Take Rash Action Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 19th – It is generally believed here yesterday that General Tojo's new Japanese cabinet will take strong steps to safeguard Japan's position, but it is not believed that Japan will immediately take further expansionist actions. It is speculated that Foreign Minister Togo's first step will be to attempt to negotiate a resolution with the Soviet Union while continuing its talks with Washington on Far Eastern issues. Although an attack on the Soviet Union is not considered absolutely impossible, it is believed that Japan will first seek a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – Yesterday, all the newspapers here prominently featured Prime Minister Tojo's remarks and the talks between Japanese Deputy Ambassador Wakasugi and State Department official Welles, with headlines such as "Tokyo Asks the United States to Resume Peace Talks" and "Japan Plans to Aid the Axis While Seeking to Appease the United States." The Star criticized Tojo's remarks, saying that Japan has clearly stated that its government is two-faced, seeking to tie the hands of the United States while at the same time aiding Hitler to the extreme. Tojo even admitted in his official remarks that he would make Japan's ties with the Axis powers even closer, while Wakasugi relayed to Welles Japan's willingness to reopen peace talks. The Australian government's Prime Minister Curtin's statement that the Australian government is closely watching all developments is also highly valued by the evening newspapers. However, the Australian government's order that newspaper reports regarding the Far Eastern crisis be limited to official statements is considered significant by the evening newspapers.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 19th – "The Washington Star" stated in yesterday's editorial, "Unless a political miracle occurs, Japan has decided to achieve its hegemony in East Asia with the samurai sword, or else commit national seppuku as punishment for defeat." The newspaper stated that the new Prime Minister Tojo Hideki is a well-known warmonger, "When the time is ripe, Japan will take action. Is there any doubt? As the Soviet Union suffers a disastrous defeat in Europe, Japan's attack on Siberia is imminent."</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Comment Extensively, Expressing Great Expectations for the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 19th – Japan's new Prime Minister Tojo visited the Ise Grand Shrine in central Japan at 10 p.m. last night to report his "assumption of new office." This move reflects the severity of the international situation. He will return to Tokyo today. According to normal procedures, the Prime Minister usually makes his first trip to the shrine within two weeks of forming a new government. Other cabinet officials will go within this week. Japanese newspapers celebrated the rapid formation of the new cabinet, because Japan is encountering an unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that Japan's new cabinet is what the Japanese people have long hoped for, a cabinet that can cope with the serious situation facing Japan. It eagerly hopes that the new cabinet can fulfill its mission, and at the same time, it will strive to eliminate various internal and external obstacles that may hinder the realization of Japan's national policy. "Nichinichi Shimbun" commented on the fact that the new cabinet only replaced six members compared to the previous cabinet, saying that Tojo, who was a key figure in the Konoe cabinet in his capacity as Minister of the Army, is now the head of the new government, which shows that there will be no major changes in policy. The new Minister of Commerce and Industry stated that the new government's aim is to promote the edge of the East Asian prosperity sphere, and to adopt a policy of low prices. It is generally believed that the new cabinet's retention of four former cabinet civilians is only for the convenience of affairs, and not because of policy reasons. Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent appointment as Minister of the Army and Minister of the Interior is noteworthy, and Tojo's appointment of Togo as Foreign Minister can be seen as a clue to Japan's future foreign policy, as Ambassador to the United Kingdom Shigemitsu Aoi is currently in Tokyo, and has the qualifications for a long diplomatic career, but is not used. Therefore, some people believe that Japan will try to maintain tranquility in the north and leave the south to wait for future development. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Suzuki, a cabinet member who does not hold a ministry, is currently retaining his original position, which is also a noteworthy point.</p>
<h3>Willkie's Radio Address: Incompatible with Axis Powers; Advocates Abolishing Hypocritical Neutrality Law; Yarnall Also Criticizes Japanese Policy</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th – Willkie recently delivered a speech during a national broadcast initiated by the "Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies," stating that the United States must abandon the hope of peace. The Axis powers are now gradually gaining the upper hand. If we do not act quickly, it will be too late. We must no longer deceive ourselves. We must know that Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo are linked by the dangerous dream of conquering the world, unbreakable, believing that the victory of one country is the victory of all. Their aim is to control the world and destroy freedom and democracy. Our ships, if not armed, will continue to be torpedoed and sunk. Unless we deliver rapidly increasing quantities of goods to the countries fighting for freedom by sea and land, the victory of the Axis powers cannot be stopped. But even that is not enough. We must abolish the hypocritical Neutrality Law. We have no room for negotiation with the warmongers of Tokyo and the dictators of Berlin, but only to stop them on every continent and in every ocean. Mr. Willkie did not broadcast in person due to a cold. The speech was read by Ms. Thompson on his behalf.</p>
<p>International News Service, Providence, Rhode Island, 19th – Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnall, said in a radio address today that the policy of Japanese expansionists is merely an "excuse." He also said that the soldiers in Tokyo are now trying to profit from the war in China. Mr. Yarnall continued, "We anticipate that the futile efforts to mediate between the U.S. and Japan will now come to an end." Mr. Yarnall has always advocated a tough policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 19th – "The New York Times" stated in yesterday's editorial that no matter what difficulties the United States encounters, it must not abandon its opposition to Japanese aggression. The newspaper said that the only hope for limiting the area of unrest from spreading and the conquest actions in the Pacific is to continue the current policy of the U.S. government. The editorial warned against allowing Japan's policy of intimidating the United States to continue to develop. The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. Pacific Fleet has the power to tighten economic pressure, and can also send more bombers from the U.S. Army to China, in order to effectively resist any aggressive action by the Japanese cabinet. "The New York Herald Tribune" said, "The era of short-sighted appeasement is now over, and a new era of honesty is about to begin, but this may worsen U.S.-Japan relations." "The Baltimore Sun" explained the Japanese cabinet crisis, saying that it was another victory for the extremist elements in Japan. This move is a good lesson in isolation, and they opposed the U.S. policy of aiding the Soviet Union, but have failed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Arrive in New Zealand: Maiden Flight Postponed</h3>

At the same time, the "Clipper" on the route to Honolulu has also been postponed. The company did not want to give a reason for this measure, and refused to say whether it was related to the order to stop U.S. merchant ships from sailing to friendly ports.</p>

<h3>Australia Cooperates with Democratic Nations to Jointly Cope with the Far Eastern Crisis; Australian Prime Minister States that Preliminary Defense Plans Have Been Completed; Dutch East Indies Hints at Willingness to Provide Bases for U.S. Use</h3>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 19th – Australian Prime Minister Curtin warned last night that aggressors are now making desperate attempts to defeat the Soviet Union and expand the war in the Pacific. If the Soviet Union is defeated, Germany will be free to turn to Southwest Asia and North Africa in the winter, and return to attack Britain in the spring. If the war extends to the Pacific, the Australian people will take a completely realistic view of the protection of their vital interests. Australia wants to maintain peace in the Pacific, and does not want to participate in a policy of encirclement, nor does it want to take aggressive actions that could disrupt peace, but Australia is fully determined to do everything in its power to defend itself. All preliminary measures necessary for the defense of Australia and its territory have been taken. Important decisions have been made regarding cooperation with Pacific nations, which is the responsibility of the government. In summary, the Australian people and government are paying very close attention to all developments.</p>
<p>United Press, Canberra, 19th – Australian Prime Minister Curtin suddenly convened a special wartime cabinet meeting yesterday. Afterwards, an official gazette was issued stating, "I assure the people that the government is paying attention to all the facts and has taken all necessary preliminary defense steps to protect the territory of this country." Mr. Curtin said that he had recently discussed Pacific defense measures with the United States. He said, "Since I took office, the government has taken a number of important decisions to cooperate with other Pacific nations. These decisions have gone further than what was previously considered possible. Our naval strength is very abundant, the army is well-trained, and the armaments have greatly improved. Our air force strength has greatly increased, and the production of armaments, including aircraft, is progressing every week. In addition to our self-defense capabilities, it is particularly exciting that our country can closely cooperate with other democratic countries in the Pacific. If the war spreads to the Pacific, Australians will take an absolutely practical view of protecting their main interests, and will resolutely do everything in their power to defend themselves." He also said, "The government has jointly conducted a broad review of the situation with Sir Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces."</p>

We stand with the democratic countries in the Pacific."

They are now being instigated by the Germans, so these people should be awakened from their delusion immediately. The United States should take the lead in this matter." "The Sydney Morning Herald" also said, "The war is now on the verge of crisis. Tojo's appointment as the new Japanese Prime Minister can predict this island nation's pro-Axis policy. The United States should take on this most difficult responsibility in this time of crisis."</p>

<h3>A Perspective on Japan Today</h3>
<p>When the news of Konoe's resignation and Tojo's cabinet formation first spread, the international community experienced no less trepidation and shock than when the Tripartite Pact was concluded last autumn. Even now, the personality of the Tojo cabinet remains, in the eyes of the Japanese themselves, as something whose "precise political qualities are not yet fully clear." However, in its first declarations upon formation, such as the selection of cabinet members and the announcement of domestic and foreign policy platforms, it has not given the impression of reckless recklessness. Instead, it appears to align with the views of some who speculated that "once the military takes the stage, it will shift toward conservatism." Based on this observation, even though various aspects related to the Pacific have been extremely tense in recent days, it may not necessarily be difficult for them to relax momentarily. What follows the cabinet reshuffle in Japan may not necessarily be the initiation of southward or northward expansion, but rather the continuation of US-Japan negotiations or the launching of a diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union. In the past two days, optimistic views have begun to sprout in the democratic countries. Some may believe that the tense Pacific situation is not difficult to restore to what it was more than a month ago!</p>
<p>The mandate to form a cabinet in Japan being bestowed upon a young, active-duty military officer can naturally be explained by numerous reasons. However, the most important point is that, apart from this, Japanese politics today has no other path to take. In other words, after all other attempts have failed, it is necessary to play its last card. Tojo is the center of gravity of the young military officers, but in addition to being capable, he is also a military officer with a multifaceted personality. He drafted plans for operations against both China and the Soviet Union and launched anti-British and anti-Soviet movements. However, he also patiently supported the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact and negotiations with the United States in the second and third Konoe cabinets. He is known as a radical but has little connection with the "reformist" faction and has always remained a military officer, unlike other military officers with strong political inclinations such as Koiso, Yanagawa, Kawakami, and Kobayashi. In recent Japan, there is no doubt that the conservative camp has failed. However, no matter how much the radical elements clamor, or how Nazi Germany uses diplomacy, they would rather let the military officer Tojo take power than allow the likes of Nakano Seigo to rise to prominence. This shows that they have not given up the final step of control over the political situation. What Tojo has been displaying in recent days may be precisely what the senior statesmen expect of him. After the "February 26th Incident," Lin Senjuro formed a cabinet as a military officer and unexpectedly obtained the cooperation of the zaibatsu. His measures were not more extreme than those of his predecessors. This is not without precedent in Japan.</p>
<p>However, the essence of things can never be judged solely by their appearance. Especially in today's Japanese political situation, one should not attempt to discern the whole from one or two isolated phenomena. Even though the Tojo cabinet lacks radical colors in personnel and political platform, there are several noteworthy characteristics of the new cabinet itself. First, regarding the rejuvenation of Japanese military affairs and the promotion of national defense production, Tojo has devoted the most effort among successive Japanese Army Ministers. Of the four political platforms he announced the day before yesterday, the item "strengthening domestic military institutions and mobilizing the strength of the entire nation," although listed last, can be believed to be the most central task of the new Japanese cabinet. Second, in the "New Order Movement," which failed under Konoe, the highest ideal was the unification of military and political power. Now that Konoe has stepped down, this ideal has also been realized. However, it is not that politics is unifying military power, but rather that the military has begun to control politics in name and in fact. Third, the position of Japanese Home Minister is of great importance in domestic affairs and is usually held by someone with the qualifications of a Deputy Prime Minister. Now, Tojo serves as Prime Minister, Army Minister, and concurrently Home Minister, concentrating major political and military affairs in one person. Apart from him, there are few strong figures in the cabinet. Apart from the military, almost everyone else is a bureaucrat. This is an extremely authoritarian form of political system, strengthening military power and control over everything internally. All of this is intended to simply emulate Nazi Germany and quickly transform the entire country into an institution suitable for war. This trend cannot be concealed by its moderate appearance.</p>
<p>So, why hasn't it manifested a tense and confrontational stance on the surface? First, because preparations are not sufficient. For the past year, the "Movement to Establish a Highly Developed National Defense System" has only sacrificed the people's enjoyment of the lowest level of life to force Japan, which has a light industry advantage, to embark on the path of developing heavy industry. However, due to insufficient resources and manpower and the heavy pressure of the international economy, peaceful industries have shrunk extremely, and the results of war industries have not been good. The miracle of the United States completing four 35,000-ton battleships in a row this year is something Japan cannot dream of. Second, it must wait for the right opportunity. The Soviet Union has not been completely defeated, and the United States has not yet truly faced a two-front war crisis. If it were to take action against the outside world in such a situation, it would only further stimulate the other party and strengthen its vigilance. And third, and most importantly, it is still necessary to obtain a more favorable strategic situation. If it were to immediately advance southward or attack the Soviet Union, Japan would inevitably face fighting in an environment of encirclement on all sides. Even if Tojo is a proponent of operations against both China and the Soviet Union, he cannot help but hesitate under the current circumstances. In his ideal, he must open one or two sides of this encirclement before attempting to take risks. Therefore, on the one hand, Togu, who has pro-Soviet aims, is appointed as Foreign Minister, and on the other hand, Sugimura makes demands on the United States to continue negotiations. And in its four political platforms, it first put forward the resolution of the "China Incident."</p>
<p>The Lin Senjuro cabinet was once a relatively moderate cabinet in form, but in fact, it formed the ladder for the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. This past event is precisely what the world should be most wary of.</p>
<h3>Battles around Moscow Reach a Stalemate; Red Army in the Center Launches Fierce Counteroffensive; Recapture of Kalinin Not Yet Confirmed</h3>
<p>International News Agency dispatch, Moscow, 19th – The Soviet Supreme Command announced yesterday that the fierce resistance of Soviet troops at the approaches to Moscow has inflicted significant setbacks on the German forces. As the battles around the outskirts of Moscow have reached a stalemate, Moscow Radio announced last night, "When Soviet troops rise up to defend their sacred city, they are like a wall of steel." It is claimed that the Soviet 9th Regiment has repelled the German advance in the Vyazma district, annihilating two German infantry battalions. In the past five days, Soviet troops have annihilated 10,000 German soldiers in this area alone.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – Winter has arrived in Soviet territory, and the Eastern Front is now covered with ice and snow. Fierce fighting continues, especially in the center. German forces have repeatedly attacked the defense lines around Moscow but have been repelled. According to Soviet announcements, German forces have suffered particularly heavy losses in the Belinsk area, losing 3,000 soldiers, 50 tanks, and a large amount of other equipment in one decisive battle. According to reliable sources contacted by Angara, the unexpectedly fierce resistance of the Soviet forces on the central front has forced the German side to withdraw a large number of troops fighting on the southern front. Therefore, the pressure on General Rabuteni's forces has eased somewhat. Rabuteni's forces are still fighting valiantly around Mariupol.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch, London, 19th – The Red Army High Command broadcast an official communiqué on Moscow Radio last night, which did not confirm the Red Army's recapture of Kalinin, 100 miles north of Moscow, and Orel, 215 miles southwest of Moscow. However, the communiqué stated that Soviet troops fought stubbornly with German forces throughout the day yesterday on all fronts, with particularly fierce fighting on the western front.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – The Moscow newspaper Pravda stated that the German plan to encircle Soviet troops in the Belinsk area was anticipated by the Soviet side and dealt with accordingly, so the German forces ultimately failed to achieve the victory they had hoped for. Pravda's reporter in the Belinsk war zone reports daily on the situation in the area and on the southern front. It is said that the German attempt to encircle Soviet troops in Belinsk was repelled. It is difficult to predict how the battles in this area will develop. It is said that German forces have repeatedly suffered heavy losses. German forces on the southern front are now intensifying their attacks on the Donets Basin and the Sea of Azov. Soviet troops are fiercely resisting, and the fighting is extremely fierce. Many villages have been lost and regained repeatedly. At the same time, the German High Command also announced the end of the battles of Belinsk and Vyazma. A special communiqué issued by Hitler's headquarters stated that the battles of Belinsk and Vyazma have now concluded satisfactorily. General Bock's army, together with the air force commanded by General Kesselring, has almost completely annihilated the Soviet troops under Timoshenko, totaling as many as eight armies. Reuters' military commentator said that both Soviet and German communiqués indicate heavy fighting in the past 24 hours, especially in the center. However, the advance on Moscow has not made much progress, indicating the increased resistance of the Soviet troops and the slow progress of the German forces.</p>
<h3>Soldiers and Civilians United in Defending Moscow; Defense of Moscow as Solid as a Wall of Copper</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – No detailed reports other than official communiqués have been received from the Soviet Union. However, the situation in the past two days has not caused pessimism. The tenacity of Soviet resistance is stronger than the German ambition to advance, giving the Moscow garrison time to arrange defenses. Soviet radio mentioned that the defenses around Moscow are as strong as a wall of copper, indicating that the defense lines around Moscow are deeply layered and not easy to break through.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – Moscow Radio broadcasted to Leningrad last night, briefly stating that Moscow will forever be a Soviet city and will not allow the enemy to enter. The enemy is currently deploying many troops to the eastern theater, but we will never abandon this famous city. We are all participating in the defense, and the spirit of the people of Moscow is the same as that of our comrades in Leningrad. We will never abandon the Soviet capital.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Possesses Vast Military Strength; Determined to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch, London, 19th – Radio stations here broadcast news today, strongly asserting that the Soviet General Staff still possesses 150 fully equipped army divisions, totaling 2.5 million soldiers. These troops are stationed in the Ural Mountains and are actively training. They can be transferred to the front lines at any time to assist in the war.</p>
<p>International News Agency dispatch, London, 19th – The Sunday Express published an interview with Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky today, stating that the extent of British aid to the Soviet Union will determine how long it will take to defeat Hitler. "However, in the coming weeks, no matter what changes occur on the battlefield, the Soviet Union will fight Hitler's Germany to the end. The Soviet people know what the purpose of the war is, so they are united as one and as solid as iron. The two great powers of Britain and the Soviet Union, militarily, politically, and economically, should help each other as needed to achieve success."</p>
<h3>Soviet Garrison Completes Mission; Safe Withdrawal from Odessa</h3>
<p>TASS dispatch, Moscow, 19th – The Battle of Odessa lasted for about two months. From the first day to the last, the Red Army and the National Guard repeatedly repelled the German and Romanian forces. The valiant defenders of Odessa have completed their mission of destroying enemy manpower and materiel. The German claim that the Red Army withdrew from Odessa after being pressured by German and Romanian troops is a ridiculous lie. In fact, the German and Romanian forces mobilized 18 divisions and repeatedly attacked the city without success. If the Soviet High Command had not ordered a withdrawal for strategic reasons, the German forces would never have been able to enter the city. This battle cost the German and Romanian forces several divisions, with particularly heavy losses suffered by the 13th and 15th Romanian divisions. In the final battle, these two divisions suffered 6,000 casualties. The Red Army's withdrawal from Odessa was without loss, which proves the perfection of its organization.</p>
<h3>Britain Establishes Strong Base in the Near East; If Nazis Attempt to Invade the Caucasus, Britain Will Provide Military Assistance to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>International News Agency dispatch, London, 19th – News from Cairo released here yesterday stated that British and Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Wavell has established a strong base in northern Iran and Iraq.

Sir Croford, of the Army Ministry, declared yesterday that if Germany invades the Caucasus, Britain will provide military assistance to the Soviet Union. It is said that "the test of true strength is about to begin." It is also pointed out that German forces have advanced an average of 400 miles along a 1,400-mile front in Soviet territory. German forces will attack Baden and Baku to control Soviet oil fields. As for Britain, it will also support Soviet defenses in this area, because aiding the Soviet Union is also defending Egypt, India, and the Far East. Labor Minister Bevan stated yesterday that the Soviet Union has now lost a large amount of resources for national defense production, so its situation is indeed very difficult.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Decides to Move Capital to Samara</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Christian Organizations Establish Joint Secondary School, Classes Have Begun Successfully</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) To facilitate domestic youth enrollment, Christian organizations have recently established the "Guangdong Christian Joint Secondary School" in Shuangxi Mountain, Lian County, Guangdong. The principal is Pastor Guan Enzhu. According to what Mr. Guan told reporters in Hong Kong, the school is jointly run by ten Christian schools and several Christian organizations, including Lingnan, Zhenguang, Zhenzhong, Peiying, Lingying, Xien, Huaying, Xiehui, Guangzhong, and Meihua. Classes began on September 16, with a total of 200 male and female students in both senior and junior high school levels. The school has 35 faculty members, including three foreigners: Professor Paul from National Sun Yat-sen University, and Mrs. Chuan Xin and Ms. Carol, who have already departed from Canada and will arrive soon. To facilitate enrollment for poor students, those who cannot pay tuition are allowed to substitute with rice, paying 100 or 200 catties of rice depending on their grade level. This is a special feature of the school. The school has now set aside 10,000 yuan for scholarships to reward poor and diligent students. It also plans to open an agricultural studies program to cultivate agricultural talent and increase agricultural production. Mr. Guan also stated that Mr. Li Hanshun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has expressed great welcome to the organization of the school and has offered many words of encouragement, requesting the establishment of branch schools in various places. However, the school is financially strained and has limited capacity, so it is afraid that it will be difficult to meet Chairman Li's expectations. In the current situation, the establishment of each branch school would cost 10,000 yuan in national currency, but we are still willing to make the greatest effort in hopes of establishing a branch school.</p>

<h3>Chinese Football League Opens: Hong Team Wins 7-1 Against Xuhui, 3-1 at Halftime, Over 5,000 Fans</h3>
<p>This year's Chinese Football League did not stop due to the withdrawal from the Western League. Good news came yesterday, the first match between the Hong Team and Xuhui kicked off. The match was held at Xuhui Public School. Fans were excited, with over 5,000 people attending. The scene along the Xuhui Bridge was unprecedented. The Hong Team is the incarnation of Donghua, showing its strength from the beginning. Xuhui has many rising stars, but they were able to calmly cope with the strong opponent. Goalkeeper Gao Zhiwen and center forward Zhou Defa showed their experience. The Hong Team took the lead 3-1 in the first half, and ultimately won 7-1, defeating Xuhui.</p>
<p>Dai Linjing Scores First</p>
<p>Xuhui kicked off, testing their skills, but it was saved by Banglun. Li Ningquan led the Hong Team's center forward, with Linjing providing support. The Hong Team launched a fierce attack, and Gao Zhiwen made many saves. At 15 minutes, Binghao picked out Linjing who shot low from 15 yards and scored, opening the scoring. Huang Rengui of Xuhui then hooked a player with his foot and was penalized with a penalty kick. Lu Fang missed the shot. At 25 minutes, Lu Fang received a clever pass from Youliang and scored with a header. At 35 minutes, Zhou Defa broke through and scored, making it 1-2. Soon after, Binghao took a corner kick, and Youliang headed it in. The Hong Team led 3-1 at halftime.</p>
<p>7-1, Xuhui Defeated</p>
<p>The second half began, and Ah Dai of the Hong Team retreated to defense. Dianhua was moved to the front line, and Li Ning stepped down. Guodong entered the game. At 16 minutes, Han Longhai hooked the ball into the net, making it 4-1. Zhuang Wenquan scored an own goal, making it 5-1. At 31 minutes, Longhai lightly pushed the ball in, making it 6-1. Lu Fang charged into the box, and because Gu Zhiyi committed a handball, a penalty kick was awarded. The shot was invalid. Zhuang Youren took the penalty, but the goalkeeper moved his foot first, so it was retaken, and he missed again. Finally, Binghao scored again, and the Hong Team won 7-1.</p>

<h3>Applications for Foreign Exchange Not Approved: Stabilization Fund to Reconsider, Designated Operating Banks Have Been Notified, Actions to Collect US Dollars Can Be Suppressed</h3>
<p>The Sino-British-American economic conference, held in Hong Kong, concluded on the 15th. British representative Bomb Meier and American representative Kirkland, who participated in the conference, have flown to Chongqing. Members of the Stabilization Fund, Fox, Chen Guangfu, and others, also reviewed and adjusted the working principles of the Stabilization Fund as a result of the conference in Chongqing. Their mission in Hong Kong has ended, and they have returned to Chongqing together. As a result of this conference, news has emerged from the Hong Kong financial community that the following points will be given important consideration: (1) Controlling Anglo-American trade in Shanghai, (2) Strengthening control over finance between Hong Kong and Shanghai, (3) Curbing speculation by Shanghai merchants, (4) Determining countermeasures against the actions of Japan and Nanjing, (5) How to provide effective assistance to the Chinese government. As a result of the Hong Kong conference, more lenient measures have been taken regarding applications for foreign exchange from Shanghai importers.</p>
<p>Good Faith Applications to Be Reconsidered</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that all banks in this city holding special certificates from the US government to operate foreign exchange have recently received a notice from the Stabilization Fund, stating that the Fund is prepared to give favorable consideration to applications for foreign exchange in good faith by importers before August 18, which have not yet obtained the necessary backing for trade from any source. Once the amount of foreign exchange to be settled can be allocated to each bank, the Stabilization Fund will make a comprehensive decision on this matter. The financial community believes that most of the good faith applications for foreign exchange will be approved. Under these circumstances, the soaring price of US dollars will retreat to a considerable extent, making Shanghai's trade more regular. However, applicants must answer the following questions, which are included in the application form. The application form first states, "For goods imported before August 18 that lack all or part of the necessary foreign exchange backing, if you intend to request approval for foreign exchange, please submit an application form including the following questions together with the handling bank."</p>

<h3>Stock of Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>According to news from the miscellaneous grains industry yesterday, the stocks of various miscellaneous grains in this city, such as cooking oil, flour, beans, and buckwheat, are very substantial, and there is no fear of shortages in the future. From January to August of this year: (1) A total of 521,919 dan of wheat were shipped to Shanghai, worth 3,036,450 customs gold units, equivalent to 8,219,670 yuan in national currency, most of which came from the United States. (2) A total of 15 dan of sago flour were shipped to Shanghai, worth 237 customs gold units, equivalent to 642 yuan in national currency. (3) A total of 796,213 dan of wheat flour were shipped to Shanghai, worth 7,038,505 customs gold units, equivalent to 19,053,233 yuan in national currency, most of which came from the United States and Canada. (4) A total of 833,649 dan of unnamed miscellaneous grains were shipped to Shanghai, worth 2,625,581 customs gold units, equivalent to 9,814,448 yuan in national currency, most of which came from the Dutch East Indies.

Judging from the above sources, the substantial stock of miscellaneous grains in this city is not an exaggeration. Moreover, the sources are constantly arriving, and the outflow is as usual, so the stock is likely to continue to increase.</p>
<h3>American Tanker to Arrive This Weekend with One Million Gallons of Yellow Gasoline, Samples Received by Mobil and Other Companies, Cannot Be Used for Airplanes Even After Refining</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency learned from related sources yesterday that a tanker will arrive in Shanghai this weekend, carrying one million gallons of gasoline. Mobil and other gasoline companies in this city have already received samples of this gasoline, which is yellow in color and slightly darker than the yellow gasoline currently sold by Asia Petroleum Company. According to a gasoline merchant, the colorless gasoline currently sold on the market can be refined and used to power airplane engines, but this yellow gasoline cannot be used to power airplanes even after refining. Once this yellow gasoline arrives in port and is sold, colorless gasoline will gradually disappear from the market in this city.</p>
<h3>Three-Year Construction Plan for the Great Rear Area, Over 400 Coastal Factories Moved Inland, Carrying 70,000 Tons of Machinery to Meet Needs</h3>
<p>Economic construction in the Great Rear Area is still very tense, despite the widespread air raids. According to statistics, over one thousand new factories have been established. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from related sources in this city yesterday that the central government's three-year construction plan was initially drafted in principle by the Central Design Bureau and distributed to various agencies for compilation. Except for a few new agencies that have not yet completed the process, the remaining agencies have submitted their three-year plans to the Bureau for review. As for the first year of the three-year construction plan, it is compiled separately, stipulating that it should be compiled and submitted by each agency to the Bureau by the end of last month. The Bureau can complete the compilation of the two plans by the end of October.</p>

This type of work is a first in the country for the bank. The government has specially hired relevant authorities and experts to establish a Land Finance Review Committee, selecting Sichuan, Kang, Shaanxi, Hunan, and Guangxi as business areas, gradually seeking to promote and select demonstration areas in various provinces as demonstrations.</p>
<p>Factory Loans Around 200 Million</p>
<p>According to news from the industrial community in this city yesterday, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, over 400 factories have moved from coastal ports to the inland, carrying 70,000 tons of machinery, and have resumed work in the inland. Currently, they have hired over 100,000 male and female workers in the unoccupied areas. Although factories in the inland have experienced technical and economic difficulties, wartime factories have increased production by two or even three times. Since the beginning of the war, the government has provided a total of 200 million yuan in national currency to factories.</p>
<h3>Savings for National Construction: Increased Interest Rates</h3>

Those who purchased savings bonds before are also allowed to receive a supplementary payment according to the new interest rates upon maturity. The government guarantees the safety of the savings.</p>

Various companies, factories, and firms have begun to prepare for the repayment or extension of credit loans due at the end of October and for the establishment of new loans. Banks and firms are extending 70-80% of the loans due until the end of April next year. New credit loans are more than in previous years, with interest rates ranging from 8% to 1.2%, aiming to regulate industry and commerce finance. The Money Trade Association has scheduled an inner plate conference for 2 p.m. on the 25th of this month to publicly decide on inner plate market prices.</p>
<p>Special Preparation for Industrial and Commercial Reserves</p>
<p>Shanghai's industry and commerce, in accordance with the "Special Reserve Measures for Industry and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stipulate that when there is a surplus at the end of each business year, in addition to setting aside public reserve funds, a special reserve must also be set aside. Now that the end of the lunar year is approaching, they have all prepared to set aside reserves themselves to consolidate their own foundation. The methods for setting aside reserves are: (1) For surpluses exceeding one-fifth of the total paid-up capital, 10% of the surplus is set aside. (2) For surpluses exceeding one-quarter of the total paid-up capital, 20% of the surplus is set aside. (3) For surpluses exceeding one-third of the total paid-up capital, 30% of the surplus is set aside. This special reserve fund is deposited in banks approved by the government to be established.</p>

<h3>格拉第遄返舊金山 預籌滬美航綫 計劃如何越過代管島嶼 視時局推移定各輪行止</h3>
<p>Gladetti Returns to San Francisco, Prepares for Shanghai-US Shipping Route, Plans How to Bypass Mandated Islands, Determines Course of Ships Based on Situation</p>
<p>The rumor that the US President Lines' ships will suspend service to the Far East has not been confirmed by any telegrams from the Washington headquarters. However, Assistant Secretary of State Gladetti came to the Far East on August 10th to inspect and study the economic situation and to focus on the issue of shipping in the event of war. It is widely believed that the Pacific situation will worsen. Gladetti is currently the general manager of the US President Lines, and his visit to the Far East must involve a comprehensive consideration of this matter.</p>
<p>Considering Shipping Routes</p>
<p>According to informed sources in the shipping industry, Shanghai is a neutral port. Regardless of whether war breaks out in the Pacific, American ships can, in theory, sail to Shanghai as usual. The shipping route may avoid passing through Honolulu, Hawaii, and Japan from San Francisco to Shanghai. At that time, American ships will sail directly from Honolulu to Manila, then through Hong Kong to Shanghai. However, how to bypass the Japanese-mandated islands that cross the Pacific remains a question worth studying. Therefore, the shipping industry is finding it difficult to make a definitive statement about the future.</p>
<p>Current Voyages</p>
<p>The current voyage of US President Lines ships already avoids passing through Japanese ports when coming to Shanghai, instead changing course to Manila and Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai and returning to the US. Recent arrivals in Shanghai, such as the President Coolidge, the President Pierce, which arrived on September 23rd, and the President Cleveland, all took the route through Manila and Hong Kong. Only on their return to the US do they pass through Japanese territorial waters from Shanghai to San Francisco. This approach is based on the original voyage plan, but in the event of any action in the Pacific, this route cannot be considered safe. Shipping companies are currently hesitant.</p>
<p>US Hesitation</p>
<p>Mr. Gladetti, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, recently left China and returned to San Francisco. His decision to come to the Far East was to inspect the economy and the repercussions of the war in the Pacific, as well as the shortage of ships and the goods needed in the export market at that time. All of these issues were on Mr. Gladetti's agenda. Mr. Gladetti, not only in his capacity as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, but also in his capacity as manager of the US President Lines, is studying the allocation of wartime-controlled shipping tonnage. Mr. Gladetti has already returned to San Francisco and is working with shipping leaders in Washington to study the navigation of American ships to the Far East and Shanghai at length.</p>
<p>New Ships Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the schedule set by the US President Lines, several President ships will sail to Shanghai before the end of November. Although the US Maritime Commission requisitioned seven President ships on June 16th, including the Coolidge, Cleveland, Taft, Jackson, Adams, etc., the order has been increased to twelve ships. Unless the US President Lines headquarters issues special orders, which are unlikely to change, the President Taylor will return from Hong Kong to Shanghai before the 27th of this month. The President Van Buren will join the Far East route on her maiden voyage from San Francisco. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the General Pershing is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on November 1st, and the General Holbrook will sail from Shanghai to San Francisco on November 17th. Furthermore, although the Panama Line's Purita left Shanghai three days ago, it is expected that the ship will sail to Shanghai again.</p>
<h3>華捕兜拿兇手出力</h3>

<p>On August 15th of this year, at approximately 9:00 AM, at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road, a famous Chinese banker was suddenly assassinated by four or five bandits and died. At that time, a large number of police officers were dispatched to arrest the murderers. Among them, Chinese Constable No. 64 and Chinese Detective No. 154 were particularly brave and commendable. The Police Department's Award Committee has submitted a request to the Bureau for each of them to be awarded the Second Class Medal for Special Merit.</p>
<h3>滬甬輪客廖廖</h3>
<p>Few Passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo Ships</p>
<p>After the Italian merchant ship "Real" was detained and released, it was leased to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, renamed "Hualin," and originally scheduled to sail on the 18th on its first voyage on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, due to incomplete procedures, it did not depart as scheduled. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 22nd. The tonnage of this ship is more than twice that of the original "Naruto Maru" that sailed on the route, so it is said that after the official maiden voyage of the ship, the "Naruto Maru" will withdraw and sail on another route. It is also learned that the "Haitong" and "Dahua," two ships leased by the Zhejiang East Shipping Company, have also joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. There are very few passengers.</p>
<h3>免費種痘運動 定期開始</h3>
<p>Free Vaccination Campaign Scheduled to Begin</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has issued a notice stating that a free vaccination campaign will begin on the 20th of this month. At that time, citizens can request free vaccinations from the following health sub-bureaus near them:</p>
<p>Vaccinations will not be given on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, or holidays. Vaccination certificates for domestic use can be requested from any of the above health sub-bureaus. Vaccination certificates required by travelers leaving Shanghai can only be obtained from the sub-bureau at 340 Hankou Road. Factories wishing to request the dispatch of mobile vaccination teams to vaccinate their workers can apply in writing to the nearest health sub-bureau, but only for workers who are vaccinated at one time with 100 or more people. As for groups wishing to obtain vaccine seeds and hire doctors to administer the vaccinations themselves, they can apply in writing to the director of the Health Bureau for verification and allocation.</p>

<h3>Record of a Visit to the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory</h3>
<p>— Nu</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, the weaving industry in our country has been booming. Even in Shanghai alone, there are factories everywhere. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and seven or eight out of ten were destroyed. Only the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory has remained intact. Because of the pressing needs at home and abroad, the production volume has increased daily, and the business has become more and more developed.</p>
<p>The factory was established in 1920 and was initiated and organized by Huang Hongjun, a textile expert who studied in the United States and is now the general manager. For more than twenty years, he has been focusing on management and has become the only great factory in China that weaves, dyes, bleaches, and sews on its own today.</p>
<p>The factory is located on Connaught Road, covering an area of more than twenty acres. It is divided into three major departments: weaving, dyeing, and sewing. The weaving department is divided into spinning, warping, threading, sizing, and finishing rooms. There are 565 looms, each equipped with an automatic motor, and can produce more than 1,700 bolts of cloth per day. The dyeing department is also equipped with the latest equipment, including a singeing machine, steaming vat, bleaching barrel, dyeing vat, drying cart, stretching cart, calendering cart, and yarding cart. It can bleach and dye more than 2,000 bolts of cloth per day. The sewing department is located on the upper floor of another factory building. All kinds of machines are used to cut clothes with electric scissors, which can cut dozens of layers of twill thick cloth at the same time. The style is accurate, and the work is fast. After the clothing materials are cut, they are handed over to female workers for sewing. The machine used is an electric sewing machine. Although the form is the same as the sewing machines we usually see, each machine has a small motor installed under it, which can be turned on and off at will with a step. It is said that more than 100 dozen ABC underwear, dozens of raincoats, and double-linked shirts and trousers (that is, shirts connected to trousers) can be produced every day, which are the factory's exclusive products, because it has a special double-linking machine.</p>
<p>The machine room is equipped with various master machines, just like a machine factory. The generator room drives all the motors and needs to burn 18 tons of coal per day. To the right is the water plant, which uses electricity to draw well water into the water tank. This place is like a water plant. Others are warehouses, packaging rooms, and decoration rooms. Looking at the entire factory, the scale is grand, and the layout is well-organized. It is truly a rare weaving and dyeing factory in our country. As for its products, there are more than 50 types of underwear cloth, flannel, indanthrene cloth, yellow twill cloth, serge, and raincoat cloth, which are sold throughout the country and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The factory's distribution office is located on Nanjing Road and has a department store, which sells not only the factory's products but also daily necessities and Western-style clothing. General Manager Huang, for the sake of further expansion, purchased more than 400 acres of factory land in Kunshan Chajia Port next to the Suzhou River as early as 1937 and planned to build it in three zones, such as a large factory zone and a staff residential area. The remaining land will be allocated to the shareholders according to the size of their shares as a model village for shareholders' residences. The factory is moving forward, and the future is unlimited.</p>

<h3>前面紅燈駕車小心 爲新創銀行進一言</h3>
<p>Drive Carefully When There's a Red Light Ahead – A Word for Newly Established Banks</p>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>A bank is like a marriage agency. The task of a marriage agency is to act as a matchmaker, not to meet the needs of single men and women themselves. If it meets the needs of single men and women itself, it is not a marriage agency but a brothel.</p>
<p>A bank's responsibility is to match social idle funds (equivalent to single women) with the need for capital (equivalent to single men), so that each can get what it wants, not to open up convenience for itself. At this time and in this place, idle funds are abundant, which is of course inevitable. But why has the abundance of idle funds become a natural phenomenon? It is precisely because at this time and in this place, there is no legitimate need for capital at all. The recent successive interest rate cuts by various banks are sufficient proof of the business distress of the established banks. With only single men or only single women, a marriage agency has nothing to do. If there are more men than women, or more women than men, even the God of Marriage cannot fulfill his responsibilities. A marriage agency that sincerely works for others should only reduce in this situation, and there is no reason to increase. Unless it wants to take advantage of the needs of single women and play the role of a gigolo to satisfy its bestial desires to play with women. Using this as an analogy to the new banks at this time and in this place, which are like bamboo shoots after rain, I cannot help but worry about the general single women.</p>
<p>This article is specifically written for newly established bankers who sincerely work for others, not with gigolos as the target. If it is a gigolo, it is surrounded by bestiality, and there is really no reason to make an analogy. The author is a member of the banking industry, and all the points he discusses are based on banking business, and the destination is also banking business. Every word is pertinent, every sentence is practical, revealing the subtle and crucial points, and enlightening people to wake up suddenly. The emotions are sincere, and everything is to consider for the newly established banks. If not a banker with authority, how could he say this? The editor dares to tell the readers that the author is one of the most famous contemporary bankers, and the name under the article is only limited to under the article. As the ancient saying goes: Honest advice is unpleasant to the ear, and good medicine is bitter to the mouth. However, discerning people will not ignore these words. (The Editor)</p>
<h3>新創銀行風起雲湧 環顧事實無事可爲</h3>
<p>New Banks Springing Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain, But Looking Around, There's Nothing to Do</p>
<p>In the past year, the new banks established in Shanghai have been like bamboo shoots after rain, flourishing for a while. According to the author's statistics, there are dozens of them, large and small, that have already opened or are still in preparation.</p>
<p>(1) Those that have already opened</p>
<p>(2) Those that are in preparation</p>
<p>Name Capital</p>
<p>Dayuan Bank 2 million yuan</p>
<p>Great Wall Bank 1.2 million yuan</p>
<p>Guofu Bank 1 million yuan</p>
<p>Wuzhou Bank 5 million yuan</p>

<p>Zhenye Bank 1 million yuan</p>
<p>Maotai Bank 1 million yuan</p>
<p>Daye Bank 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Yongtai Bank 1 million yuan</p>
<p>The above is only what the author knows and is listed in the table. There are unknown numbers of those that have already been prepared but have not yet held an inaugural meeting, or those that have already been initiated but have not yet been completed. Looking at the above situation, it can also be seen that there are so many new banks that it is an unprecedented phenomenon. However, looking around at the facts: What is the current situation in the Shanghai market? Do we need so many banks? Can we accommodate so many banks? And is the emergence of so many banks for the sake of industrial development? Can they develop and grow? In today's abnormally developing market, we really cannot help but say something.</p>
<p>Deposits and Loans are Contradictory, Poor Digestion</p>
<p>The prosperity of the Shanghai market seems to be growing day by day. However, considering the actual situation, industry is not developed, and trade is not prosperous. This superficial prosperity is undoubtedly not a normal economic development but a special phenomenon during wartime. Let's analyze the current market situation: The first factor contributing to the prosperity of the market is the concentration of population. People from the occupied areas are still stranded in Shanghai. The second is the concentration of overseas hot money. As a result of exchange control in various countries, overseas funds are moving to the Shanghai market. The third is the depreciation of currency and the soaring of prices. All industries are making profits. The fourth is the active speculative market, and the number of nouveau riche is emerging one after another. Because there are these factors to support the market, the Shanghai market is booming on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is suffering from excessive surplus of funds. Under such circumstances, the banks' use of funds also first encounters unprecedented difficulties. Large loans are dared not to be made in this turbulent situation. Small overdrafts are rarely needed by industry and commerce. As for hoarding goods, the current prices of goods have already reached their peak. Who dares to take this risk? It is of course not easy for banks to cope with these difficult times. Government banks are tightening their business, which may be an exception due to environmental factors. However, commercial banks have always relied on deposits and loans to make a living. Since loans cannot be made much, they can only make calculations on deposits. Therefore, commercial banks have recently needed to reduce interest rates repeatedly and impose various restrictions on deposits. This abnormal disposition of not welcoming deposits is also precisely to indicate that it is extremely difficult for banks to use deposits currently and that they have to find ways to reduce deposits to lighten the burden. Although the increase in bank deposits is due to the prosperity of the market, if the bank's business cannot keep up with the prosperity, it will only make the bank suffer from indigestion. This phenomenon is ultimately not a blessing for the future of banks.</p>
<p>Different Motives, But the Same Risk</p>
<p>The current Shanghai market is like this, and the bank's situation is like this, but why do emerging banks still spring up like bamboo shoots after rain, regardless of the difficulties and dangers? The reason is:</p>
<p>(1) Clerks Want to Experience the Addiction of Being a Manager Clerks of general banks or money shops are usually underlings and are not easy to rise. Therefore, taking advantage of the current abundance of idle funds, they organize banks under the lobbying of various parties and realize their idea of ​​becoming a manager.</p>
<p>(2) Old Banks Do Not Give Interest on Deposits Most commercial banks currently do not pay interest on demand deposits, while loan interest rates are still around one point per month. On the surface, there is a profit of more than one point per year on a deposit and a loan. Such cheapness is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity, so it has aroused the interest of various parties in establishing banks.</p>
<p>(3) The Large Number of Nouveau Riche Recently, due to the active speculative market and the prevalence of hoarding goods, many nouveau riche have emerged. These people can organize banks and recognize sufficient shares in a moment's chat after tea and wine.</p>
<p>(4) Industry and Commerce Run Banks Themselves Industry and commerce, in view of the past dealings with banks, have been at the mercy of others in everything. Currently, each industry is thriving, and funds are abundant. Therefore, they run banks themselves. On the one hand, it is for their own funds to move around. On the other hand, it is for industry and commerce to stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding Banks as a Glorious Career Banks are the head of all industries, and doing banking seems to be glorious. Furthermore, they can take this opportunity to appeal to the public. Those who want to start a business often change to running banks.</p>
<p>(6) The Government's Tolerant Policy The Shanghai environment is special, and the government is far away in the southwest, so it is beyond its reach. The government is too lenient in accepting applications for verification of capital and registration for new banks. As long as there is proof, registration can be approved and a license can be issued. Therefore, the procedures for establishing a bank are easier than before.</p>
<p>Judging from the above factors, it can be seen that the rise of new banks is not really due to the needs of the environment, but because the general public regards banking as a fashionable business, and everyone wants to try it adventurously. Establishing a bank with this mentality, the success or failure of the future is really unimaginable.</p>
<h3>名目五花八門 業務不脫陳軌</h3>
<p>Various Names, But the Business is Still Stale</p>
<p>The establishment of new banks is easy, and the number of them is naturally in line with expectations. This small concession has suddenly increased so many banks, and competition in business is inevitable. However, new banks are not comparable to old banks. Without special characteristics, it is not enough to attract customers. What is the nature of these new banks? It can be understood from their business. The main business of banks is to handle deposit and withdrawal, make various loans, and engage in trust matters. In the current commercial banks, they are generally the same and have no special distinctions. However, among these emerging banks, there are those called commercial banks, those called iron and steel banks, those called tobacco banks, and those called industrial banks. There are many names and various patterns. Their business in commercial banks is to engage in commerce and handle savings and trust businesses, which is of course no different from general commercial banks. In specialized banks, as the name suggests, their scope of business should be limited to a certain industry. However, taking a look at the reality, these specialized banks are still commercial banks in nature and have not reached their specialized level. Even if specialized banks want to achieve business specialization, under the current financial situation in China, it may not be possible to do so for a while. There are quite a few specialized banks that already exist in China, such as the Industrial Bank, the Industrial Bank, the Reclamation Bank, and the Salt Bank, but after decades of struggle, their business has not yet reached the specialized purpose. These emerging specialized banks are certainly not talked about. Therefore, when it comes to the nature of newly established banks, there is nothing special about them, and they are no different from commercial banks. Although there is this specialization as a banner, it is only to appeal to the public and add many specialized bank terms in the banking industry.</p>
<p>With the Elderly on the Road, Banks Take the Lead</p>
<p>A bank is a business organization that relies on doing business to maintain survival. Since new banks have no special characteristics, their scope of business is naturally no different from that of old banks. However, under the current situation, the business of old banks is shrinking day by day: restricting deposits, reducing loans, suppressing deposit interest rates, and saving expenses. This phenomenon is sufficient to show that banks cannot develop externally and can only find ways to remedy internally. If the situation of old banks is like this, how can new banks be an exception? Moreover, new banks have not yet gained credibility, and the difficulties in business are only more serious than those of old banks. The following facts can be used as evidence:</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Currently, the market is full of idle funds, and it seems that it is not difficult for banks to absorb deposits. On the side of old banks, because of their existing reputation, they can attract deposits, but they have this feeling. However, on the side of new banks, first, their own credibility is not established, and second, there are too many newly opened banks. It is not easy to absorb a large number of deposits. Therefore, new banks often cause competition among their peers because it is not easy to absorb deposits. Because of competition among their peers, the phenomenon of releasing plates to absorb deposits often occurs.</p>
<p>Loans</p>
<p>Loans are the main business of banks and the source of interest. If there are no special reasons, why would they easily give up? The fact that old banks dare not make a large number of loans at present of course has its internal factors, which is also felt by new banks in common. Moreover, judging from the situation when banks make loans: banks simply dare not deal with bad customers. Good customers, in peacetime, if there is a small shortage, banks want him to use money, but they have to buy over the negotiations. Currently, good customers still use very little money. Even if they occasionally lack funds, they have to talk to the bank about the conditions before asking the bank to accommodate them. Therefore, under this situation, bank loans can be said to be mostly the borrower's market. The terms of the loan are opened by the borrower. Old banks' customers are still like this, and in order to promote business, new banks may have to accommodate customers even more. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In extraordinary times, in addition to deposits and loans, the business operated by banks also includes foreign exchange, domestic remittance, government bonds, stocks, real estate, and goods. In the past, many banks made money from this aspect. However, this way of making money is either because the market has declined, or because the changes are small, or because market prices have already reached their peak. Currently, it is either that the doors are closed, or that the risks are heavy. It has been regarded as a daunting task by general banks. If new banks still do it, I am afraid that not only will they not be able to pick up what others have spit out, but they may also end up losing more than they gain.</p>
<p>Where to Fill the Huge Expenses</p>
<p>Therefore, the business of banks is becoming narrower and narrower. What old banks cannot do, new banks may not be able to do. Moreover, old banks are not fools and will not make money. New banks may not have unique eyes and be good at making money. The difficulties in business are the same for new and old banks.</p>
<p>Currently, the situation is turbulent and uncertain, and prices are soaring endlessly, but the banking business cannot develop with it. However, it is quite difficult to maintain the expenses of a bank, especially for newly established banks. In addition to the regular expenses, they also have to spend a huge amount of start-up expenses. Where do these two expenses come from? It is worth discussing.</p>
<h3>Increasing Start-up Costs</h3>
<p>Before opening, a bank's largest expense in the first year is for premises and decoration. Bank premises must not only be neat and beautiful, but also located in the city center. Currently, in Shanghai's central business district, businesses stand shoulder-to-shoulder, leaving hardly any vacant space. The few suitable locations for bank branches are even scarcer. To solve the branch location problem, new banks are willing to offer huge transfer fees to secure superior and well-appointed premises. Consequently, transfer fees are driven higher and higher, and bank start-up costs also increase significantly. In the current situation, it is not surprising that a new bank spends ten or twenty thousand yuan on transfer fees, decoration costs, and the like. If the bank's capital is only one million yuan, then before opening, its liquid assets have already been reduced by 20% or 10%. Whether a new bank can bear this is a serious question.</p>
<h3>How to Secure Regular Expenses</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased daily. Banks' regular expenses have also grown substantially. As a public service, banks cannot excessively cut costs. For a small-scale bank, even with the most economical calculations, monthly expenses would likely not be less than 25,000 yuan, and annual expenses would not be less than 300,000 yuan. The question is, where will this 300,000 yuan in expenses come from? Let's analyze it. Banks rely on deposits and loans to survive, using the interest rate difference between deposits and loans to offset expenses. New banks cannot offer no interest, or only nominal interest, like established banks. Therefore, their interest rate spread is likely only around 3%. Assuming deposits are ten million yuan and loans are also ten million yuan, the income and expenses would balance out. However, in reality, not all deposits can be loaned out, and due to the unstable situation, most deposits are demand deposits. Banks must retain some reserves. If five million yuan of the ten million yuan in deposits are kept as reserves, the income from operating the remaining five million is clearly insufficient to cover expenses.</p>
<p>The above only applies to medium-sized banks. The situation is even more dire for small banks with a capital of 500,000 yuan or large banks with a capital of 2 million yuan. Assuming a simple break-even scenario in operations, the current situation is already stretched thin. How can they maintain long-term sustainability? It is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic During Founding, Dumbfounded After Research</p>
<p>Judging from the circumstances when new banks were founded recently, the founders are enthusiastic, and investors eagerly participate. On the surface, it seems that running a bank offers great profits. However, upon closer examination, banks face increasingly difficult circumstances, and business expansion is impossible. Expenses are growing rapidly, and how will the profits and losses be balanced? The future is fraught with difficulties, and running a bank is not an easy undertaking. Moreover, with the current uncertain situation and the superficial market, storms and rains can strike at any time. If a new bank's foundation is unstable, it is in danger of collapse. Therefore, in such an environment, the only way for new banks to survive is to stabilize their foundation and advance slowly. The most important methods for stabilizing the foundation are: (1) Do not overextend business, (2) Strive to save on expenses. Of course, at the beginning of a new bank, it is necessary to seek more business, and when prices are soaring, it is impossible to save on expenses. Undertaking it is quite difficult. However, how to handle this dilemma depends on each bank's own decision. The author is merely revealing the facts and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages. New bankers are not short of intelligent people and should be able to respond well.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Essay Contest on Filial Piety Sponsored by the YMCA</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's Junior Group has designated the previous month as "Filial Piety Month" since last year. This year, they are holding an "Essay Contest on Filial Piety" as usual, which is truly meaningful. We naturally sympathize with and are happy to support this initiative to promote traditional morality. Filial piety is inherently a virtue. Everyone, whether in childhood, middle age, or even old age, must do their best to be filial while their parents are alive. If parents are psychologically troubled, spiritually distressed, or economically in need, children should do their best to find ways to alleviate their concerns and put their parents at ease. This is the first condition for conducting oneself in the world, establishing oneself, and practicing the Way. If a person cannot fulfill their filial duty to their parents, I can assert that this person will not make great contributions to society or the nation. Throughout history, there are countless examples. Think about it: our parents are the first benefactors who gave us life and raised us. To be unfilial to one's parents is to forget one's roots! How can a person who forgets their roots be trusted? However, in addition to filial piety, we should also distinguish between knowledge and ignorance, right and wrong. If parents engage in rebellious or immoral behavior, children should directly admonish them to avoid future harm. Therefore, filial piety must also have its limits. Blind filial piety is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>The British humorist and playwright George Bernard Shaw had a perspective on raising children. He believed that parents raising children is a form of investment in society, and society should later demand from these children the rewards they owe. I believe this view is excellent. Then, when we practice filial piety, wouldn't it be even better to expand the scope and serve society?</p>
<p>If we ourselves have become parents, then we should work hard to cultivate ourselves and create a rational family life. Otherwise, how can we pass on excellent character to our children?</p>
<p>My Family Problems</p>
<h3>Excerpts from the Essay Contest: My Problem of Remarriage</h3>
<p>— Wushuang</p>
<p>After three years of companionship, my wife, who was ill for a long time, finally quietly passed away. What she left behind was a three-year-old child who didn't yet understand human affairs. On one side, there was a husband living a solitary life; on the other side, there was a lonely father. This has been going on for more than a hundred days.</p>
<p>Although my mother came from the countryside to take care of my food, clothing, and daily life, and to raise this poor child, a problem is clearly looming: "Remarriage."</p>
<p>Not long after my wife passed away, many relatives and friends came to talk to my mother, to talk to me about matchmaking. This is undoubtedly well-intentioned. However, on my side, my parents have only one son, and the child has only me, the one who loves him the most. I used to be an extremely ambitious person. Although that ambition gradually diminished after entering society from school and gaining a slight understanding of the ways of the world and human hearts, I still want to struggle while I still have energy. A family is naturally needed, but how to form that family is worth considering.</p>
<p>Some people say, "You are remarrying, so you should be more flexible in choosing a spouse." The wife is the husband's support in times of success, his comfort in times of disappointment, his lifelong companion, and his only confidant. In what things can you be flexible? Can you be flexible in choosing a spouse?</p>
<p>Others say, "The first condition for marrying a wife is that she has a good temperament." Yes, for the sake of my child, the new wife naturally needs to have a good temperament. Although she cannot treat the child as his biological mother, she must not abuse or discriminate against him. But in reality, how many stepmothers do not abuse or discriminate against children? Nine out of ten matchmakers will say that this girl has a good temperament, but after marriage, she may treat other people well, but not you; or she may treat you well, but not the child. Then it will be "too late to regret."</p>
<p>Others say, "To find a spouse who meets your ideals, you must go out and socialize." Indeed, many happy couples are formed in the arena of love! But I don't have that kind of interest. Moreover, although I received the latest education, I still feel like a Chinese person and don't quite agree with the latest forms of socializing and the concepts of men and women.</p>
<p>So, I can only rely on other people's "matchmaking." However, when the issue of men and women reaches the stage of "matchmaking," marriage is not far away. What I want is to seek mutual understanding through this, and then talk about marriage after a considerable period of time. "Understanding" is not a "promise." I can't casually agree, but the matchmakers are so sincere, and those being matched are so serious, I am afraid of delaying other people's youth.</p>
<p>Therefore, my method is limited to the first impression or even a photo of the other party, and a few words of introduction from the matchmaker. Isn't that even more difficult?</p>
<p>I can apply formulas and check tables to solve a problem in natural science. I can also refer to books and consult experts to come up with an answer to an international problem. But I can't answer the problem of "remarriage."</p>
<p>Thinking of my deceased wife's voice and appearance, stroking my child's round face, I suddenly realize that I am still young. Let's wait a few years before talking about this problem. (Contribution to Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund)</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>It is truly commendable that Mr. Wushuang can consider his problem of remarriage so thoroughly and do his best to think about his child. I hope he can continue to use his calm mind and passionate paternal love to choose his future spouse.</p>
<p>I don't know if Mr. Wushuang's deceased wife was married through matchmaking or how the couple's feelings were. When getting married the second time, at least he can avoid the mistakes of the first marriage. American marriage experts often ask this question when examining whether a marriage is happy: "If you were to marry again, would you marry someone like your current wife?" I would like to ask Mr. Wushuang to ask himself.</p>
<p>In modern times, choosing a spouse should be done with caution. It is best to choose one from several women (women should also use the same method to choose a husband). Relying solely on a photo and a meeting is too dangerous.</p>
<p>Many people now advocate that the time between getting to know each other and getting engaged should be long, and the time between getting engaged and getting married should be short. Mrs. Shan'e is one of those who advocate this. As for formal socializing, it is very noble. Mr. Wushuang doesn't seem to want to insist.</p>
<p>Finally, I am very moved by Mr. Wushuang's love for his child.</p>

<h3>Protecting Eyesight</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>To protect eyesight, don't make the light too bright or too dim. The light should come from over the left shoulder.</p>
<p>Do not lie down to read, and do not read in moving vehicles. If you must use your eyes constantly during the day, you should not use them too much at night. Every fifteen minutes of reading, look into the distance for a while and often rotate your eyeballs left, right, up, and down.</p>
<h3>A Week's Menu of Everyday Dishes</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Chop pork or beef finely to make minced meat, commonly known as "thousand-cut meat." Some people, for some reason, never eat thousand-cut meat in their lives. In fact, thousand-cut meat is not bad at all and is easy to digest. Many dishes and snacks also require thousand-cut meat. For example, cabbage heart with crab roe lion's head, minced meat with tofu, mashed potato and beef patties, shao mai, soup dumplings, tangyuan, shui jiao, guo tie, etc., are all very delicious dishes and snacks. Isn't it a pity not to eat them? In this era of expensive rice and firewood, it is already very fortunate to have meat to eat. You must not be picky and complain too much. In a family, every husband should know this to avoid making it even more difficult for the wife in charge of the kitchen to plan the daily meals.</p>

<p>Celestial Kitchen Recipes (77)</p>
<p>Holding a crab and admiring chrysanthemums has always been regarded as a joyous and elegant affair. Now, the "gutless gentleman" (crab) is running rampant in Shanghai from various production areas. Regardless of the season or flavor, everyone wants to enjoy a good meal. However, while the taste of crab is good, proper cooking is especially important. Therefore, I will publish various methods of eating crab in this recipe to add to everyone's enjoyment.</p>
<h3>(139) Roast Crab</h3>
<p>— Draft by Xu Yangzhen</p>
<p>Ingredients: Perilla, ginger, Zhenjiang vinegar</p>
<p>Instructions: The method for cooking roasted crab is the most common, but there are a few points to note. Add perilla when cooking to detoxify it, and embed a slice of ginger on the crab's belly button to dispel its coldness. Before cooking the crab, tie it with hemp rope into a tightly bound package. Do not immerse the crab in water when cooking. Instead, use a steamer rack or a bamboo basket to prop it up and steam it. This way, the cooking method will not cause the crab to lose its freshness because it is immersed in water. When eating, do not forget Zhenjiang vinegar and minced ginger.</p>
<h3>(140) Crab Stuffed with Pork</h3>
<p>— Draft by Cao Fukun</p>
<p>Ingredients: Crab, lard, salt, wine, ginger, soy sauce, fennel</p>
<p>Instructions: Wash the crab, open the back, embed a whole piece of lard, place it in a bowl, add salt and wine, put it in a pot and simmer. Once cooked, it can be eaten.</p>
<p>Dear friends: If you want to purchase "monosodium glutamate," "essence of Celestial Kitchen soy sauce," and oil, salt, medicine, and vinegar, please call "44594," and a special messenger will deliver it immediately without charging a delivery fee.</p>
<p>Family Mailbox</p>
<p>This publication originally planned to set up a family mailbox and is in the process of planning it. Recently, however, we received two letters from readers, and in fact, we have to reply immediately.</p>
<p>Ms. Jiaying: Your brother-in-law is suffering from loneliness, so he naturally needs you as a companion. However, Ms. Jiaying, in your current position, you should use your reason more and not act on emotions, because you are in a very important position. It's not just about the present, but about your next few decades. How are you and your brother-in-law in terms of interests, are your temperaments compatible, how much is the age difference? If you get married, can you have a happy married life? These are all things you should consider. If you have the value of getting married, naturally it's not impossible, but you must go through the proper procedures to ensure that you have solid protection. Do not let emotions cloud your reason. If you think there is no possibility of marriage, then you can explain your difficulties to your brother-in-law frankly and ask him to respect your will with the passion of loving your sister.</p>
<p>Ms. Guaiguai, it's great that you and your half-sister have good feelings, but you don't have to focus on formalities. Feel free to look for opportunities at any time. Why rush? At the same time, you can use appropriate methods to resolve the bad feelings between her and your mother.</p>

<h3>Saving a Poor Child</h3>
<p>— Weisun</p>
<p>Every day, we receive many letters from readers and never neglect them. Small problems are solved immediately. What makes us most heartbroken and difficult to solve is the appeal of general impoverished readers. If we ignore it, we suffer the condemnation of our conscience. If we want to help them, we don't have an ideal solution. Often, there are several difficult events on the desk. After reading the sincere and sad letters, we turn them over and over, and finally, we cannot easily throw them into the wastepaper basket. As a result, we try our best within our personal means to find ways to help them separately. Some are especially asking friends for help, and some are pointing out a path.</p>
<p>Last night, a reader wrote that last spring, a neighbor sent over a newborn baby boy. They were very happy to adopt him. They feed him milk powder every day. Now he is growing up, smart and lively, and very lovely. Unfortunately, this child recently fell ill. They consulted both Chinese and Western doctors, and the prescriptions have accumulated to dozens, enough to be bound into a small account book. The writer's financial situation was originally extremely difficult, and he has spent a huge amount of medical expenses and has exhausted all resources. Now that the child's illness is improving, but he is absolutely unable to afford the cost of diagnosis and treatment, he hopes we can think of a way to save a poor child. He said that he couldn't bear to see a lively child end his life after a short journey in life.</p>
<p>We were moved by him. After some consideration, we didn't want to appeal to readers publicly. We have already asked a respected doctor to solve this problem. Our agreement with the doctor is that the medical expenses will be completely waived, and he will do his best to diagnose and treat the child. However, it is necessary to investigate the writer's situation who appealed to us.</p>
<p>Saving a child is not difficult, but how to save countless people who are "poor and have no one to turn to"? That's what we think.</p>
<h3>Local Scenery: "Speculation"</h3>
<p>— Cai Jiedong</p>
<p>What is this place? It is the oil market. Recently, life has become more and more difficult, and even basic things like pancakes and fried dough sticks have to be sold for ten cents each, and they are getting smaller and smaller. This is the situation created after going through here:</p>
<p>"Naturally! The market will continue to rise. Short sellers are embarrassed, hahaha!"</p>
<p>"How long will it rise?! Speculation, speculation, it's terrible!"</p>
<p>"Only buying in, no selling out. Can you still start? The market is going to be terrible."</p>
<p>So, there are many people buying oil in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>Not long ago, it was only selling for a little over one yuan per catty. In a few days, it quickly rose to two yuan and a few cents, with daily restrictions. The words that the seller refused multiple purchases were used to regulate prices. The oil bought at two yuan and a few cents is very different from the oil at a little over one yuan. The oil color is brownish-yellow and cloudy. I don't know what it was mixed with. Insiders say it is mixed with Qing oil. Qing oil is refined from cottonseed, which is the lowest grade of oil. No one eats it much, but what can you do?</p>
<p>At this time, some people who uphold justice came out to speak. This is almost the old rule. Aren't you in charge of what you say, and I'm in charge of what I do? Who is willing to be in charge? The current time is an extraordinary period, not like normal times. On the other hand, public officials are fighting among themselves. This is happening between bulls and bears. The bulls are greedy and insatiable, and the bears are desperate. How much rice will be lost is still unknown. The bears are obviously a little overwhelmed and want to hang up the "no war" sign. At this moment, the momentum of the bulls is strong, so how can they give up? What's the solution? It's terrible too!</p>
<p>One day, at the entrance of the market. Suddenly, there was an unusual discovery... In order to ensure safety, the market announced that everyone was prohibited from selling short, and advised both parties to compromise. Somehow, someone suddenly said that this was completely the conspiracy of the short sellers, or perhaps the bulls were unwilling, and they insisted again.</p>
<p>Don't care about them! Most people are sighing:</p>
<p>"It's getting harder and harder to be a person!"</p>
<p>The majority of people are manipulated by a minority of people, but this world does not belong to a minority of people. The sky will not be dark forever. One day, it will be easy to be a person.</p>
<h3>Safety First</h3>
<p>— Ge Liang</p>
<p>A girl earnestly asked her grandfather about his age, got a satisfactory answer, and then asked him if he had teeth.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Um!"</p>
<p>"But there are only a few left, and those teeth are useless."</p>
<p>"Can you chew hard things?"</p>
<p>"No, no, even soft foods have to be chewed for a long time before they can be swallowed. How..."</p>
<p>"Then, Grandpa, can you keep this bag of peanuts for me?"</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Thirteen: Wandering to Shanghai</p>
<p>"Child, Nanjing is certainly a good place, but compared to Shanghai, it is ultimately a little worse. Let's not be indecisive anymore!" Because Mei Sai wanted to find a suitable organization to join in Nanjing after arriving in Shanghai, or go to a war wounded hospital to be a nurse, to both make a living and contribute to the nation. But Qiu Haitang did not think it was very appropriate, so before leaving Xuzhou, he repeatedly explained it to her.</p>
<p>Since the incident of Shang Laoer, Mei Bao has been particularly filial to her father. After listening to him say this several times, she no longer insisted on staying in Nanjing.</p>
<p>"As long as Dad wants to go, I will always follow you!"</p>
<p>"I think Shanghai is not as good as Nanjing. I still have a few acquaintances there. It's not that I necessarily like that place." Qiu Haitang thought of those old officials who desperately supported him in the past, and he felt a little hope in his heart. Of course, he did not hope that people would send him dowries, diamond rings, write articles, or even embed his photos in the newspapers, but he thought that as long as one of these people could use one percent of their previous kindness again, then his and Mei Bao's life would not be a problem.</p>
<p>For me, life always chooses the easy path, just like moths must flutter towards the light.</p>
<p>In less than half a month, Qiu Haitang and his daughter wandered to this world-famous metropolis. But Qiu Haitang's pocket only had eleven yuan left. (240) (End of Chapter 13)</p>
