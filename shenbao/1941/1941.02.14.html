<h3 id="c6">美國軍略的布置如何 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏前日對新聞記者所作重要表示，要旨在於說明美國即使被迫而加入遠東戰局，然對英之戰具供給小致稍受影響，本報對此談話、已加評述。據電訉，美國紐約交易所市塲昨日充滿戰爭的恐怖，各專家鑒於目前局勢不安定，咸不願發表預言，多具戒心云云。這在上海，也就有不少的人，錯覺爲美國即將參戰了。其實，不問誰對於美國參戰的願意或不願意，不問美國動定的影響所及之爲利爲害，亦不問事實上美國終於戰或不戰，若僅以羅總統的談話爲根據，絕對不夠取爲美國參戰的憑證。羅總統談話的內容，自有其新提示；亦即人們對於美國，在聆悉羅總統談話之前與後，應有異樣認識。蓋美國政策的堅定，夙爲世人所了然，美國對英有休戚攸共之感，亦爲世人所共見；於是世人多以爲美國所欲予厚援者是英國，美國所更戒備而致力者重在大西洋：今由羅總統的談話　殆可推想英美兩國對於國際的戢亂使命，是合作而分工，美國不重在大西洋而重在太平洋，即對於遠東方面有加人戰局的較大可能，將盡較大的力量；此其一。美國政策雖堅定，世人惟虞其事實所限，無法兼顧、而美國偏重歐后之結果，或對遠東侵略者予以寬恕與放縱，或使遠東力面的虛聲恫嚇獲收牽制美國對歐的功效：今由羅總統的談話，知美國對歐洲與對遠東、力能維繫其堅定政策而雙方並期貫澈，絕無顧此失彼之虞；更以羅總統此次談話，與去冬國務卿赫爾氏談話開宗明義、首先指斥遠東者相印證。眞是無獨有偶，決非偶然，而爲計畫的以遠東戡亂爲己任；此其二。所謂堅定的政策，當然不受何種動搖，然而企圖動搖之者，以及懷疑其或有動搖餘地者，大有人在；今羅總統的談話敲好發表於日本野村大使抵美之日，是擯絕了無聊的動搖的嘗試，避免了無聊的外交辭令德行迴與浪費；羅總統所保留的。祗待他得「老友」野村怎樣代表了日本政府，表示接受美國的政策與否；此其三。這已各龐大無倫的「民治國兵工廠」，究竟發揮其生產能力到如何程度，夙爲世人所注視；今由羅總統的談話，予世人以賅括的滿意的答覆了；此其四。從這四點，使世人對美的認識。肅淸而確鑒。但是並非謂美國即將參戰，美國即將在遠東參戰。羅總統所假定的參加遠東戰局，重載「被迫」；被迫是不由自己主動，故美國戰不戰的關鍵在于是否有人迫他參加遠東戰局；率言之，視日本迫他否？對此問題，吾人雖深信美國政策的堅定，但仍不免渺茫祗感，且不免迂疎之感。誠以日本向美國啓釁，若不從破壞九國公約說起，則甚難想像今後日本對美將作更甚於破壞九國公約的啓釁。所可想像的；一是日本瘋狂了，一是德義在歐洲大勝了。瘋狂者的行動，在它自已亦所無從說起，自不在吾人話下。至於德義制勝，雖經羅總統的談話而知美國仍不因此而變更其遠東政策，然複雜的事實不是簡單原則所得範圍。例如九國公約被蔑視了，保持越南現狀的宣言被蔑視了，今則頻傳泰國亦允予侵略者以海空根據地了；這些得步進步的事實，與美國利益不容再受侵損的原則，同時擺在美國面前。雖日影屬馬來新加坡與何屬東印度群島、當係美國所必視爲自己的國防前綫而不再放任，然越南與泰國的相繼淪爲侵略根據，這所予美國以「迫」的程度，在美國方面究竟作何感覺與估價？這在政策原則上儘有寬容的解釋，但在軍事戰略上豈得否認其爲機關重要的佈局。這些佈局，是啓寡的石；若不堦啓寡，則將跟着德義在歐洲的失敗而消失其機能；但英國倘若在歐洲失敗，則這些佈局又必將立即發揮其各種擊破與分嘗一　的宏效。故美國政策祗堅定，雖無可疑；美國軍實之儘量生產，雖見成績；然軍略的佈局固能不落人後與否，爲之不勝憂疑。</p>

<p>美國會參戰嗎？這是各人所探索的重大問題。茲將紐約泰晤士報上月二十一日所載的結論，譯錄如下：</p>
<p>美國對於這次歐戰，最初十能否避不捲入漩渦，現在已變成應否參戰的問題了。這種轉變十以證明戰爭本身與美國外交政策的動向。當戰事爆發之初，美國一面企圖在法理上保守中立，一面則在實際上援助民治國却又以非交戰國自居。及至義大利參戰，挪威，丹麥，荷蘭各國相繼淪陷，法國瓦解，英國慘遭空襲，商船迭被擊沉及對美匯率跌落，這個問題的外表　隨之改觀，即在法理上也不再保守中立。羅斯福總統甚且宣佈英美兩國休戚相關，存亡與共了。</p>
<p>據總統所信，德國對美宜戰有兩大不利：即（一）德美兩國一旦開戰，德國外交人員即不能在南北美洲各地活動，因而無從進行宣傳工作和策動各種陰謀，美國撤退駐德使節，並無多大影響。（二）德義兩國停泊在美國的輪船將全被沒收，英國艦隊且可把商船護航的責任委託美國辦理，然後以全力與敵相週旋，同時並可獲得美國海空生力軍。根據這種理由，總統和大部份人都信，美國雖以全力援助英國，仍可不致捲人戰爭漩渦。</p>
<p>但另一部人則調，美國須在太平洋方面留駐大部份艦隊，英美兩國的飛機製迭率，遠不及德國，在一九四二年以前，難與德國並駕齊驅。那時軸心各國迫不及待，恐早巳向美開募了。美國一旦參戰，其所可供給英國的軍火，就不免大减特减。</p>
<p>上次歐戰時，美國保守中立三年之後，始乃參戰，此次開戰不過一個月，　國即廢止禁運軍火出口，放棄中立。上次歐戰時，威爾遜總統直到準備宜戰以前，未曾聲明與英法休戚相關，現在羅斯福總統早已如此宜佈了。上次歐戰時，美國境內的外國人，均於交戰國態度，好惡不一，現在可不同了，無數的波蘭人，反國社黨的德國人，義大利人，捷克人，法國人，英國人，斯于的那維亞人，希臘人，荷蘭人，比利時人及愛爾蘭人，都一致擁護援英政策。</p>
<p>參議員范登堡原是孤立派健將，當初反對干與歐戰最力。當波蘭遭受侵略時，他力主嚴格施行中立法，反對總統廢止禁運軍火出口的主張，甚至說，他的舌頭一日沒有呆着，他必定死力反對美國軍隊出國作戰。</p>
<p>可是英軍遭遇挫折之後，一般人深以加拿大遭受侵略爲懼，范登堡也贊成加拿大如被侵犯，美國應派兵前往援助了。他鑒於挪威丹麥各小國的被佔，已覺悟希特勒的不顧信義，足以威脅全世界，便毅然擁　總統「在參戰以外」全力援英的政策。</p>
<p>到了去年十二月二十八日，總統廣播爐邊閑話，范登堡也表示同意，承認軸心國的勢力有戢止之必要。不特此也，他還說美國苟迫不獲巳，必須參戰以保障公允的和平，他願接受保障的責任。</p>
<p>總之，美國人民決心保衛民治一事，到了現在已成爲一種田經地義，無可反顧。他們此刻處於戰爭的邊綠，正在鎭定的注視着烏黑的深淵，不會被人推進去，只要自己在這邊沿上能立得住脚，也不會自動的投進去。</p>
<h3 id="c31">享受人生的樂趣 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>吾們生活就應該享受人生的樂趣，無論　　做　一種　業，終應該愉快歡樂，然後方秘能　感到工作的　　。中國有一句古語說「人無笑臉莫開店」的確是有陣理在內的，因爲一個人當時愁眉苦臉，怎會得成功呢？古時的希臘人也有一句格言，叫做「健全的心靈，寓於健全的身體」。所以無論我們所做得時什麽行業，我們必須遊健全的身體。</p>
<p>不過，一個人終究不能　生沒有疾病的。不要區說那些危險而嚴重的病症，即使是發生了一點疼痛—頭痛，牙痛風　　成者精神痛，或者月經痛—業就覺得痛苦非常樂。有了這種疼痛，我們感到失望，因爲我們不能作娛樂，不能參加宴會，卽使是看了一塲電影，也成爲不可能的事。</p>
<p>可是這種疼痛　可能很迅速地終止的，所以不必任受。最迅速安全的止痛方法，是吞服　利痛一片或者二片，在十分鐘之內，疼痛完全消減，我們的身體，也就十分舒適了。散利痛是瑞士　孚孟羅氏有限公司所製造的，所以絕對安全可靠。</p>

<p>據美國方面人士之表示、美國政府採取此種行動、（勸吿無必要之美僑、自遠東撤退）完全係對太平洋局勢、採預防步驟、有一事足資證明者、美國本部人民之赴夏威夷者、向不受任何限制、亦不必出示護照、今則非得當局之許可不可、且又頒佈一緊急法令、禁止婦孺至遠東旅行、有若干美僑最近自美國重返遠東、企圖携帶妻女同行、然因受該法之限制而不果、即美國男子欲來遠東者、未具備充分之理由、當局亦不允發給護照、</p>
<p>最近又頒　新公民法</p>
<p>據昨日自美領署當局處所得之消息稱、美政府所公佈新公民法、已於一月二十三日開始生效、本市數百入美國籟之華人、將因該法之生效、而受其影響、美國政府所頒佈之新公民法、對於入籍問題及喪失國籍問題、均有詳細之規定、該法對美國本國人民、影響並不重大、然入美國籍之外人、若在其母國繼續逗留三年以上、仍不回美、即須喪失美國國籍、然會在美國及美國屬地、繼續居住二十五年以上者除外、該法於一月十三日起實施、因之二年之內、將有若干歸化之美國人喪失美國國籍、該法又規定稱、入美國籍之外人、若至外國居住二年以上、即自動成爲該地之人民、則其美國國籟、亦因而喪失、此條係專對極權國家而發、緣極權國常召入美國籍之人人伍也、</p>

<p>在此情形下，日本最合理之步驟，莫如由中國撇退其軍隊與運輸艦，近六個月以來，日本迭次向中國提出和平建議，且其條件愈趨遷就，良有以也。蓋日人已認識欲消滅華軍，決無希望，在另一方面，日本受盡時間之壓迫，而南進之舉，又刻不容緩，然則何小先與中國謀和，以便將在華軍隊調往南太平洋？如果對星加坡之企圖得手旣有無限之資源，如油鍚，橡皮，食米，棉花等可得，而緬甸路亦可予以切斷，則以後再圖中國，亦不爲遲。日本乃以爲目下不妨給予中國以寬大之條件，一俟星加坡陷落後，一切協定，即成廢紙。此種如意打算，固似甚合理，但中國人所見，亦豈不及日人？深知大部日軍退出中國後，將給予吾人以暫時之休息機會，但星加坡一旦陷落恢，則非但爲英國之災禍，亦爲吾人之不幸，最後恐亦爲美國之不幸也。日木目下所提和議，旣僅爲暫時之休戰，祇有利於日本，因此吾人認中日戰爭爲目下普遍戰爭之一部份，故永久之和平，亦必須爲普遍世界和平之一部份，否則吾人惟有繼續作戰。但今後吾人之作戰，不僅爲維持吾人自己之地位，同時亦爲對日人施以壓力，使其無法抽調軍隊以從事於南進。</p>
<p>最後勝利　已獲保障</p>
<p>中國從事抗戰之時，遭遇缺乏金錢及缺乏飛機兩重大之問題，在三年破壞之戰爭中，其最富庶之工業區域，非毀於砲火，即遭人所掠奪，其交通大部份已告斷絕，然中國仍須供養數百萬戰士及游擊隊。中國法幣之國外滙價，雖跌至戰前滙價之五分之一，而在國內之價格，則高漲六倍。所幸英美兩國，在此困難之時，加以援手，貸以鉅款，據最近自國內來此之人語余，羅斯福宣佈以一萬萬元貸予中國時，其所生之反響，有似閃電，痛苦憂鬱之華人，聞此消息後，大爲興奮，最後勝利之心，又重得一保障矣。</p>
<p>人民備受　日方茶毒</p>
<p>世人對於英國城市鄉鎭之遭遇不分皂白之炸彈所發生之恐怖，固熟聞之矣，然英國最低限度，尚有高射砲，防空汽球，驅逐機及轟炸機爲之保衛，以之報復，而中國目下之情形，則截然與此不同。日木飛機得優游翱翔於我人之城市及鄉利之天空，選擇目標，加以轟炸；而絕無遭遇報復之危險，如一九三九年五月三四兩日，日機之狂炸重慶，平民因而死傷及焚斃者，爲數達三萬人。此數目較倫敦過去六個月中，每天所受之殘酷及在轟炸而死亡之民衆之總額，且爲衆多。日本爲濫用術語之老手，數百萬日兵或死或傷，數百萬日乒轉輾作戰之時，仍揚言中國戰事僅爲一事變而已。</p>
<p>中國對美　不辱使命</p>
<p>在此次世界戰事中，美國或永速不成爲一交戰國家，然不問美國人是否願聞此言，我人仍將以美國之同盟者自許。爲，國拱衛太平洋中之堡壘。余來美國以來，足跡所至之處，即深感美國人之友善，余以爲美國人對華人之友好，並非完全出于對被侵略之犧姓者之同情，亦非僅承認我人英勇防禦之結果，余爲其問尙有若　値得使美人對我之友善之理由，此卽汝等心中有一根深蒂固之本能，認爲汝等能信託一偉大之民族，使戰禍不迫及國門。此偉大之民族，若能渡過難關而生存，則將與汝等携手合作，使着了若孫，能在太平洋區域中，過安全之生活，在上蒼保佑，君等援助之下，我人必能不辱使命。（完）</p>

<p>記得「故事」中很多類似這樣的：</p>
<p>「一個人在屋子裏發現一隻小老鼠，他毫不在意。</p>
<p>後來小老鼠變了大老鼠，他也補在意。</p>
<p>後來又變了許多大老鼠，他還不在意。</p>
<p>後來老鼠咬壞東西，咬痛腳趾，才跳起來；可是，太遲了！」</p>
<p>本來「小不余則　大患」，「大意」自然要「失荊州」。</p>
<p>然而現在印偏儸多些明知故犯的「亮眼瞎子」，「聲帶」沒有壞就先做啞吧：「我是不會講話的！」公共汽車中發現一柄手槍，不是大家情願「行里去」做嫌疑犯嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c76">收學費記 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>校長先生急匆匆地趕進來，說是銀行裏來電話，要人趕快去幫收學費，否則，他們不收了，而且銀行裏等滿了繳費的人，他們沒有辦法。於是我就在校長先生的支配下，立刻趕上銀行去。</p>
<p>銀行裏擠飽了人，走不進去的就只能挨在門口人行道上，倒大有賣平米的樣子，於是我也只好被檔「駕」了。</p>
<p>好容易，鑽了進去，可是我這「洋盤」，却找不到走淮櫃台裹去的門路，只好去請求巡捕先生帶我去。可是這位老爺，却先在我周身上下用閃電般的目光掃射了遍之後，他來勢兇兇地逼着問我來幹嗎的，我說了來收費，他就更懷疑起來了，等他間了裹面的先生們，似乎才證實了我的身份是某校來的一位姓高的，的確是來收費的。這樣，那位巡捕先生才算放我走進了一扇用DAMM彈子鎖鎖着的邊鬥。</p>
<p>我不曉得是自己的心理作用呢，還是銀行員們沒有見過窮人，當我剛一走進銅欄干，幾十隻看慣了鈔票的眼睛，就直射在我身上，顯得分外有力地發着厥。</p>
<p>當我走進經理先生指定的，後面的小間的時候，我感到奇怪，「銀行裹也有灶坡間的嗎？……」</p>
<p>但當我正在往下想，兩隻脚還沒有完全跨進這小間的門檻，在我後面傳來了不算低的問話聲——「個種人是來幫收費個？」</p>
<p>我回過頭去，發覺一個已經上了年紀的女孩子在問着一個男職員，臉上塗得很有點噱頭，幾乎跟經過化裝的演員一樣「美麗動人」，於是我想多看她一眼，可是糟透了，她不但不覺得害羞，倒反比我狠起來，兩條綫似的眉毛往下一沉，眼睛像桂圓珠般大小地睜了我一下，這倒弄得我駭怕起來，「今天會不會到太歲頭上來勳土？J我暗自担心着。同時，我怪我自己不應該穿這件又黃又灰的倒霉掛子來，自討苦吃。</p>
<p>走進裏間，家長們已經雲集了，因爲我的職務是找收據，所以是第一個必經的關口，沒有它，銀行員十不能收費的。於是家長們都湧進了房間，幾乎軋得我氣都喘不過來，人儘往橙子上爬，站得老高。我也弄得沒有辦法了，就只好宜佈「停止分發」來要挾了，他們不退出去，我不發。最後，總算這條件兌現了，我菜繼續下去。</p>
<p>慢慢地跑上了軌道，擠軋的情形從我們這邊漸漸地移到櫃台上去了。繳錢的地方顯得熱鬧起來——多少隻手，拉着銅的欄干，累得道安穩地躺着的古銅色的柵欄，也格格地作起饗來，即使行員們高大的聲音，今天到底給外面的人潮掩沒了。</p>
<p>一個家長在自言自語：『送錢給他們，還假痴假呆，像煞有介事的搭足架子！』回過頭來，問我爲什麼學校裹今年不自己收呀？我吿訴他「不方便！」</p>
<p>差不多擠到吃中飯後，人漸漸地稀了，這才發覺有四個孩子還在那裹等着，問他們，說是有一個人替他們代繳學費，把錢拿了去，到現在還沒有繳好，其實這傢伙早就「溜」了·這時，孩子們才知道是受了騙，於是放聲大哭起來，但沒有用，錢是哭不回來的！</p>
<p>時鐘指着兩點，人頭又擠動起來。有人在吵，說是多繳了學費，也有人軋得滿頭大汗的說不出話來的，祇有熱蓬蓬的蒸氣向空中冒；更有人的口袋說是走了「私」，這些，又熱鬧起來了。</p>
<p>四點鐘過後，銀行拉上了鐵門，職員們感到愉快了，——可以鬆口氣。</p>
<p>爲了小孩子的讀書，多少人在忙碌着，這樣的收費還得收上他媽的好幾天，可是，我猜不出，不知今後將再收幾次？</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鶴</p>
<p>他和侯校長是姑表姊弟，又且利害相共，當然是沒有什麽話不好說的，當天晚上，馬廳長便把侯校長睛到自己家裹來，開始討論進行道件事的辦法，馬廳長的夫人也特地被邀列席。</p>
<p>馬廳長先把方才在督軍署裏會談的經過，一起吿訴了侯校長，僅僅因爲急於希望事情能够成功的緣故，沒有把自己對於袁寳藩的已否娶妻的一點所懷的疑慮說出來，並且還故意幫着袁寳藩解釋了幾句，藉以播除他那五十三歲的老表姐的猜疑。</p>
<p>「事情倒是很好的。」馬太太順着她丈夫的口氣說：「一個女學生能够嫁一位鎮守便，那就够她受用了！」</p>
<p>侯校長的一張瘦削得像乾枯了的橘子似的臉上，也略略透出了一絲笑意。</p>
<p>「不錯，事情倒是很好的。」她習慣地用着很低的語音說：「上個月裏，羅湘綺的父親也曾寫過一封信來，請求我待湘綺畢業之後，替她設法找一個位置，或是留在母校裹，隨便幹一些事，只望能够依舊供給食宿，別無他求。因爲這位老先生自己已失業了三年，兒子又害着肺病，正在杭州一門親戚家裹休養，所以家境非常困難。……」</p>
<p>「那末這件事就容易說了！」馬廳長很興奮地挿嘴出來說。</p>
<p>「問題不在她家裏，而在她自己。」侯校長搖着頭說：「因爲這個女孩子外貌雖是很溫柔，心地却非常高傲。前幾犬，我巳曾給她找到過一處門館，也有三十元一月的薪水，她却堅持着不願幹，理由是不願伺候富貴人家的孩子；她只希望當一個小學敎師，掙幾個　，補助她父親，待父親有了事，或是她哥哥病好之後，她還想目已積一些錢，繼續升學。所以這件事要是直接跟她自己去商量，我想十九是不會成功的。」　（三〇）</p>
<h3 id="c78">吃徒弟飯 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 乃流</p>
<p>拜了先生，當然想以後在先生那裹弁碗飯吃吃，照理我們該說吃「先生飯」或「吃師父飯」才對呀。可是不，」吃先生飯」「吃師父飯」的固然有，但是黑心先生「吃徒弟飯」的更來得多。</p>
<p>普通當徒弟，三年滿師，在這三年裏聽帥父先生們的喚使：老式的商店學徒，替先生們盛飯，掃地，做廳差，這是有傳統的習慣的；學手藝的呢，煮飯，洗菜也得做，這些雖沒有明文規定，但是不做這些就給你「回湯荳腐干」吃，那是不折不扣的。</p>
<p>現在米價貴，收一個徒弟實在養不起，但是僱一僩客師或先生，薪俸飯食更是可觀，店裏若要僱一個女傭的，那是更必說了。從這樣的比較起來，收學徒委實是便宜不過的事。黑心的師父先生們從這點着眼，於是寬宏大量的收學徒；但是另一方面却粉碎了客師的飯碗，學徒們收進來，因爲是來學的，薪俸當然沒有半分，說鞋禨剃頭錢之類，那眞是區區之數了。</p>
<p>所以，有些小的手藝店家，竟以一個師母娘，一個師父，一個學徒來充塲面。假使師母娘會操操手脚，那當然是好事，可是師母娘十個倒有九個愛擺擺架子的，於是學徒就不得不當r大脚娘姨」了。並且，因此在手藝上的學習倒隔得遠遠地了。師父們好聰明，他們會對這種事情婉轉地註下解釋的：「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人！」同時，他們又慣於說；「我們做師父的起先不也是這樣呢，老實說，不吃上這種苦，不會想上進。」</p>
<p>再說另外的一批「吃徒弟飯」者，他們嫌三年的學徒時間還太短（其實眞正的技巧上的學習，只要一年左右就可訓練得很順熟了），於是加到了五年（現在翻絲綿的就是這樣），在這五年之中，徒弟縱然很快的就學會了職業上的本領，也不會得到細微的工錢的；結果不過幫師父多賺一些錢而已。五年滿了，學徒假使找不到去處，還是在師父手下做事的話，那來學徒做來的工錢又有所調「四六拆」之類，不動手的師父却要拿個大股。</p>
<p>現在雖然有練習生工讀生等等，但在這生活像十層餅的上海，「吃徒弟飯」的還占到厚厚的一層呢！</p>

<p>假使上一天不是拍夜戲，李綺年小姐一定就很早的起身了。藝華公司的環境，雖不是山明水秀的所在，但是地曠人稀，空氣很　鮮，在空地上，她每犬要在這裏游戲一會，如跳躍，跳繩，跑步，騎自由車等。回到屋子裏，從香港帶來的老媽已爲她預備好一杯熱牛奶，有時候，還有鮮蛋，水菓，可是她的早餐很簡單，差不多總以一杯牛奶幾片餅乾居多。</p>
<p>吃完早餐，她開始整理早上由茶房送來的影迷們的信件。在這些信件中，各式各樣的性質都有。大部份是討照片的信，還有是詢問她的新作。有一次她拆開來信一看，赫然「我要自殺了」五個大字，把李小姐嚇了一跳，細看下去，下面却寫着「假　你不將照片送給我的話」幾個字。</p>
<p>許多來信中，她揀選大約有十封的樣子，自己親自作答。其餘的由她的秘書陳鳳鳴小姐依據李小姐的意思代寫回信，然後再由她自己簽名於後。應付這些影迷的來信，她每天得費去大約二小時的光陰。</p>
<p>看報是她每天上午的主要工作之一。她自己是訂閱申報的，其餘的報紙，都是向宣傳部借看，因爲宣傳部已在報紙上將與電影有關的文字都做上記號，這樣她可以省下許多寳貴的時間。</p>
<p>閱報以後，就是再熟讀她的劇本，這時候她謝絕見客，因爲她認爲這是她求進的重要準備，一定要專心從事，任何情事都不得阻礙她這時候的用心。</p>
<p>如果沒有賓客，她就與她的秘書等同吃中飯，如果有賓客，則菜餚比較豐富一點，大概三天中，必有一天她仍是吃純廣東風味的菜。她的老媽子可以做很好的廣東菜，有時也有同事們到她那裏去吃眞正廣東菜或是廣東湯。</p>
<p>飯後她約略休息一會就看看書，或是讀每天第二批的來信。有時候她也與同事們海關天空的談天，這時候，她會與小孩子一樣的嘻嘻哈哈，毫無虛僞。</p>
<p>普通拍戲總是在下午開始的，所以逢到拍戲的日子，她就準時化裝，準時上攝影塲報到。她認爲誤時是文明人的恥辱，所以她勸別人遵守時刻，而自己史不誤點，這是値得提出的。</p>
<p>在攝影塲上，她服從導演的指揮，而且也虛心的受敎，有時她偶有問題提出來和導演討論，也是根有總貌的，而且並不作肯定的表示。</p>
<p>要是下午不拍戲，她就在自己的屋子裏看看書。現在她新請了一位敎唱歌的女先生，還有一位粵劇的琴師，因爲她不但是一個電影紅星，她更是一個南國劇壇的紅伶，可是到了上海來之後，她對於粵劇幾乎爲了各種的私務荒疏了，所以現在　天至少有一小時，她在溫習各種廣東戲，將來如果有機會，她也許要在上海上一次臺。</p>
<p>有時她也出去看電影或平劇，至於舞塲，她說並不喜歡，所以去得很少。平時在吃過夜飯以後看看書報，寫完當天的日記，大概到十點鐘就睡了</p>
<p>可是一個影人的生活往往會被工作糾纒得漫無次序，　如拍戲通宵達且，白天睡覺等等，上向寫着的李小姐的一日問的生活情形，是依拍戲不多的日子而言，近來正在拍「風流寡婦」，她就祇好隨J作而轉移她的生活狀况了。</p>

<p>— 靜英</p>
<p>荀之長處是內心有戲，一字一腔，皆富戲情，一舉一動，胥具意思。嗓雖不如梅程尙，但功夫過之，故大四名旦合灌之「五花洞」，苟之嗓音唱腔能不弱於梅而又勝尙程也。白口以柔糯勝，其腔委婉，別具韻味，「還珠吟」之（擁鼻酸吟…）南梆子；「紅樓　尤」（替人家）四平調：「妒婦訣」（東牆見了）西皮原板；「釵頭鳳」之（與你一見二六（唱片），聽後能使人陶醉沈迷，近十年來悲慘調子，尤具感人功力。如「香羅帶」之二黃散板；釵頭鳳」之臨死快三眼，聆之悲從中來，心酸而淚落，莫怪荀演至此，台下女客多爲之眼紅巾濕也。一夕曾以梅苟二伶之「穆柯寨」唱片，各開二遍，細細聆來，覺梅之白口，富於音榮，苟之白口，極具戲情。梅得天獨厚，荀功夫卓絕，閉目聆荀白，儼是一小姑娘聲調口氣，此則爲梅所小及者。梅具富麗大方，尙以邁豪勝人；程之冷豓爲他伶所難學；荀之嬌媚，妖豓，悲切，詼諧，非梅尙程所長也。劍舞梅有「別姬」，程有、聶隱娘」，尙有「林四娘一，荀雖無之，第能踹蹺。梅之悲劇如「生死恨」，程之悲劇如「碧玉簪」「靑霜劍」，尙之「珍珠扇」皆述夫婦間之事，獨荀之悲劇多偏於風流債，苟非「慧」質大「生」，曷克臻此。</p>

<h3 id="c81">鶯歌蝶戀 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 黃新德</p>
<p>像「鶯歌蝶戀」道樣的片子，單看片名，似乎就頗有一看的必要，何况領街主演的又是平克勞斯貝，曼麗瑪丁和貝錫賴斯朋。然而一看之下，就難免要失望了。也許喜歡聽歌唱片的人會感到滿意，因爲片裹有「名歌七支」。然而在我看來，稱之爲一部電影終究不是新聞片！</p>
<p>「鶯歌蝶戀」的故事是什麼呢？它似乎在諷刺一個著名作曲家的無恥，因爲他所寫的作品，全是出於無名作家的捉刀。這無名作家便是平克勞斯貝和曼麗瑪丁，而那個名家也者，無義地，便是貝錫賴斯朋了。</p>
<p>像這樣的劇情，我們在畫面上見到的，應該是貝錫斯賴朋怎樣欺騙大衆，怎樣壓迫無名小卒，以及無名小卒怎樣艱苦奮鬥，而後達到成功之路。然而劇作者一心要把這齣戲變成喜劇，却把平克勞斯貝這一人物，變成一個竊玉偷香的公子哥兒，譬如前半部平克勞斯貝在公寓裹初次和曼麗瑪丁見面，那副樣子實在使人沒有好感。而後來在火車上「釘梢」一段，也不見高明。導演的手法，只够得上說一聲平平，有些地方，還拖泥帶水，不能使觀衆得到一個淸晰的概念。</p>
<p>至於各人的演技，平克勞斯貝本來不會做戲，飾這樣一個吃重的角色，無疑地是「力不從心」。曼麗瑪丁比較還好，但沒有怎樣出色的地方。貝錫賴斯朋在道片裏，眞是大材小用，不僅沒有戲做，而且這一角色的個性，也不怎樣適合。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Far Eastern Situation is Extremely Serious; American Policy Will Not Relax; New York Market Filled with the Terror of War; British Commander-in-Chief Discusses the Situation in Australia <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - The arrival of Japan's new ambassador to the United States, Nomura Kichisaburo, and the recent developments of serious matters have given observers of the Far East and Islands Committee yesterday the impression that the current situation is extremely serious. The arrival of Nomura, President Roosevelt's statement on the United States' position in the Far East, and the Navy Department's additional request for 900 million US dollars are regarded by those concerned as complex factors affecting the diplomatic situation in the Far East. President Roosevelt's statement to reporters that even if the United States were to be drawn into the Far Eastern war, its aid to Britain would not be affected was interpreted 24 hours later as a hint to Japan and Germany, namely that the joint action of the Axis powers would not affect the United States' tough policy in the Far East. A Royalist member of parliament from Rhode Island, a supporter of the government's foreign policy, said that the United States' policy toward Japan would not relax even if Britain collapsed. At the same time, the Congress expressed the possibility of accepting Japan's proposal for friendship. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>NEW YORK - The stock exchange market today is filled with the terror of war. In view of the current unstable situation, experts are unwilling to make predictions and are mostly cautious. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<p>CHONGQING - Today, the US Consul General in Shanghai issued a new announcement, advising American citizens with no need to stay in China to evacuate, which has attracted great attention here. The possibility, rumored from London, that Japan may take action in the Pacific while becoming involved in the European war has also become material for much discussion among people here. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>TOKYO - A spokesperson for the US Embassy stated today that they received instructions from the State Department in Washington last night, reminding American citizens to heed the order issued last September advising women, children, and men without essential business to evacuate Japan, which has not been revoked. The US consulates in Japan have planned to reissue the instructions. It is understood that US Ambassador Grew is not scheduled to leave Japan on the President Coolidge this month. The two female secretaries of the US Embassy are the ones scheduled to travel on the President Coolidge. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>SYDNEY - After the meeting of the Advisory Council today, a statement was issued warning the Australian people that the war has entered its most serious stage and that the nation must make unprecedented and maximum efforts for preparedness. Acting Prime Minister and Labor Party leader Curtin also jointly issued a declaration after the meeting, discussing the recent developments in the international situation. The Australian Minister for Munitions and the British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, Sir Brooke-Popham, have been invited to attend tomorrow's meeting to discuss the situation.

<p>WASHINGTON - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday accepted the House's amendments to the Lend-Lease Act, including a limit of 1.3 billion US dollars for the transfer of defense materials to foreign countries in cash or on order. The committee rejected, by a vote of 13 to 10, the Republican proposal that the President should obtain the approval of the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations before transferring vehicles of war to foreign countries. A motion by Republican Senator Taft of Ohio to lend 1.5 billion US dollars to Britain, 500 million to Canada, 50 million to Greece, and seven other amendments were all rejected. The committee also principally approved granting Congress the power to end the President's prerogatives under the Lend-Lease Act by a majority vote.</p>

<p>LONDON - Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky yesterday hosted a banquet at the embassy for British Foreign Secretary Eden, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, Bulgarian Minister Mozilov, and British Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton. It is said that the politicians discussed world politics. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has also voted on the same provision. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday rejected an amendment stipulating that the President must first obtain certification from the heads of the Army and Navy before transferring existing military equipment to any other country. Thus, an attempt to block the passage of the aid bill has been thwarted. It is noted that the House of Representatives had previously included a provision in the aid-to-Britain bill requiring the President to consult with the heads of the Army and Navy before taking action. There were rumors that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approved in principle four amendments to the bill passed by the House of Representatives: (1) Limiting the period of the act to the end of June 1943; (2) Congress has the power to terminate the effectiveness of the act before the end of June 1943 through the passage of a temporary proposal, which only requires a majority vote in the Senate and House of Representatives and is not subject to presidential veto; (3) The provisions of this act shall not be construed as permitting naval escort; (4) The President and the heads of the Army and Navy must first consult before the President can issue an order to transfer existing military equipment. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday that he "opposes further weakening the US Navy" by aiding the British fleet with another batch of warships. Knox said that the United States currently has 159 destroyers, with another 15 to be completed this year and 45 more to be completed next year. If we want to maintain a complete fleet, we cannot transfer our destroyers again. He also said that Britain has never requested to obtain the US fleet. The Navy Department is now working to quickly establish a two-ocean navy. The Secretary of the Navy pointed out that the speed of shipbuilding, including battleships, has been accelerated by 30 to 100 days compared to the original schedule. The 35,000-ton "North Carolina" will be completed in mid-April, and her sister ship "Washington" will be completed in mid-July. He also said that the Navy Department received destroyers in January that would have taken ten months to build, which was eight months ahead of schedule. He further stated that aircraft production has also increased, with a total of 900 to 1,000 produced last month, compared to only 799 in December of last year. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Willkie issued a telegraphic statement in New York yesterday, saying that President Roosevelt believes that the United States can immediately provide Britain with additional destroyers. "I am deeply surprised by Colonel Knox's statement." "The information given to me by senior government officials after I made my arguments yesterday proves that my claims are not wrong. We do have the power to provide Britain with additional destroyers as effective assistance without harming our navy and national defense." (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Informed sources say that President Roosevelt intends to strongly advocate that the British government, in order to obtain assistance under the lend-lease program, should agree to issue secret orders to the commanders of all ships of the British Navy that if Germany occupies Britain, the British ships should sail to American ports. This is not a plan by the President to prevent the British Navy from continuing to fight in other bases, but simply to prevent all or part of the British Navy from falling into German hands. At the same time, the International News Service predicts that the lend-lease bill to fully aid the democratic countries will pass in the Senate with 64 to 70 votes. Most of those who support the bill predict that the President will achieve his greatest victory since entering the White House. The rumored plan regarding the British Navy has been discussed with US military experts. According to the experts, the British fleet falling into German hands is the most tragic thing in the war, and this development will make the United States vulnerable to attack and render the current two-ocean navy ineffective.

<h3 id="e4">Dutch Ships Suddenly Ordered to Sail to Neutral Ports; East Indies Issues Statement to Japan Regarding the Position of Dutch Representatives <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>MANILA - The Dutch ship Titeleanga, with a tonnage of 12,000 tons, left here for Hong Kong last night, but returned here today. The return of the Dutch ship coincides with an unconfirmed report that the authorities in Batavia have ordered all Dutch ships to take refuge in neutral seaports and to stop all navigation of East Indian ships. The Dutch consul here said that he had ordered the Titeleanga to return in accordance with instructions from Batavia, and also said that he had ordered another Dutch ship, the Tiboshar, weighing 16,000 tons, which was sailing from Japan to the Dutch East Indies, to sail into here. However, the Dutch consul said that he did not know the reason why Batavia issued this instruction, and he did not believe that the order was issued because the situation would soon become serious. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>BATAVIA - It was officially announced today that the Dutch government in London has instructed the Dutch minister in Tokyo to state to the Japanese government that the diplomatic actions of the Dutch East Indies are directed by the Dutch government in London, and has told the Japanese government that the Dutch representatives in the recent Japanese-Dutch talks in Batavia were representatives appointed by the Dutch government in London, not just representatives of the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia. Officials also said that Japan has recognized the position of the Dutch government and replied that the position of the Dutch representatives in the Japanese-Dutch negotiations is now very clear. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>BATAVIA - Japanese sources said that the Japanese Consul General Ishizawa visited the Director of the Dutch East Indies Department of Commerce, Hogestraton, today to inquire about the reasons for the postponement and reopening of the economic negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. Hogestraton promised to reply after consulting with the Director of the Economic Department, Van Mook, within a day. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">How is America's Military Strategy Arranged? <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>President Roosevelt made an important statement to reporters the other day, the main purpose of which was to explain that even if the United States were forced to join the Far Eastern war, the supply of war materials to Britain would not be slightly affected. The newspaper has commented on this speech. According to the telegram, the New York Stock Exchange market was filled with the terror of war yesterday, and experts, in view of the current unstable situation, are unwilling to make predictions and are mostly cautious. In Shanghai, there are also many people who mistakenly believe that the United States is about to join the war. In fact, regardless of who is willing or unwilling for the United States to join the war, regardless of whether the impact of the United States' actions is beneficial or harmful, and regardless of whether the United States will eventually fight or not, it is absolutely not enough to take President Roosevelt's speech as evidence of the United States' participation in the war. The content of President Roosevelt's speech has its own new hints; that is, people should have a different understanding of the United States before and after listening to President Roosevelt's speech. The firmness of American policy has long been understood by the world, and the sense of shared fate between the United States and Britain is also common knowledge in the world; therefore, many people believe that the United States wants to give strong support to Britain, and the United States is more vigilant and committed to the Atlantic: now, from President Roosevelt's speech, it can be inferred that the United States and Britain cooperate and divide the labor on the international mission of suppressing chaos, and the United States does not focus on the Atlantic but on the Pacific, that is, there is a greater possibility of joining the war in the Far East, and will exert greater efforts; this is the first point. Although American policy is firm, the world is only worried that it is limited by facts and cannot take care of everything, and the result of the United States' bias towards Europe may be to forgive and indulge the aggressors in the Far East, or to make the empty threats of the Far East effective in containing the United States' efforts in Europe: now, from President Roosevelt's speech, we know that the United States can maintain its firm policy towards Europe and the Far East, and strive for implementation on both sides, with no fear of neglecting one over the other; moreover, President Roosevelt's speech is corroborated by Secretary of State Hull's speech last winter, which explicitly pointed out the Far East first. It is truly a coincidence, not accidental, but a plan to take the pacification of the Far East as its own responsibility; this is the second point. The so-called firm policy is of course not subject to any wavering, but there are many people who attempt to waver it, and who doubt that there may be room for wavering; now President Roosevelt's speech was aptly released on the day that Japanese Ambassador Nomura arrived in the United States, which rejected the boring attempts to waver and avoided the boring diplomatic rhetoric and waste; what President Roosevelt reserved was to wait for how his "old friend" Nomura represents the Japanese government to express whether to accept American policy; this is the third point. To what extent has the huge "arsenal of democracy" actually developed its production capacity has long been watched by the world; now President Roosevelt's speech has given the world a comprehensive and satisfactory answer; this is the fourth point. These four points have made the world's understanding of the United States clear and accurate. However, this does not mean that the United States is about to join the war, or that the United States is about to join the war in the Far East. President Roosevelt's assumption of participating in the Far Eastern war emphasizes "forced"; forced is not on one's own initiative, so the key to whether the United States fights or not lies in whether someone forces it to participate in the Far Eastern war; in short, it depends on whether Japan forces it. On this issue, although we deeply believe in the firmness of American policy, we still cannot help but feel a sense of vagueness, and a sense of detachment. Because if Japan starts a war with the United States, unless it starts with violating the Nine-Power Treaty, it is difficult to imagine that Japan will take an action against the United States that is even worse than violating the Nine-Power Treaty in the future. What can be imagined is: one is that Japan is crazy, and the other is that Germany and Italy have won a great victory in Europe. The actions of a madman cannot be said by himself, so they are not under our discussion. As for the victory of Germany and Italy, although we know from President Roosevelt's speech that the United States will not change its Far Eastern policy because of this, the complex facts cannot be covered by simple principles. For example, the Nine-Power Treaty has been despised, the declaration to maintain the status quo of Vietnam has been despised, and now it is frequently reported that Thailand has also allowed aggressors to use air and sea bases; these facts of progress and advancement, and the principle that American interests should not be infringed upon any further, are placed before the United States at the same time. Although the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, and the East Indies are all regarded by the United States as its own national defense front line and can no longer be allowed to be abandoned, the successive fall of Vietnam and Thailand into bases of aggression, what is the feeling and evaluation of the United States in terms of the degree of "forcing" the United States? There may be tolerant explanations in terms of policy principles, but in terms of military strategy, can it be denied that it is a strategically important layout? These layouts are the starting stones; if they are not removed, they will lose their function following the failure of Germany and Italy in Europe; but if Britain fails in Europe, then these layouts will immediately exert their various crushing and sharing effects. Therefore, although American policy is firm and there is no doubt about it, and although the massive production of American military power has been successful, we cannot help but worry whether the layout of military strategy can avoid falling behind others.</p>

<p>CHONGQING - Chinese military experts said today that the Japanese army's attack in southern Henan is equivalent to a sightseeing tour of suffering and starvation along the way. A spokesperson said that the Japanese army began its northward attack from Xinyang on the Pinghan Road on January 24, and at the same time launched a southward attack from Kai on the Suihai Road. The failure of this attack is the beginning of the decline of Japanese military action in China. The Japanese army has hundreds of thousands of troops, and uses strong mechanized units in the Daping Mountains of Henan Province, but still cannot occupy the area or inflict heavy damage on the Chinese army. The Japanese army has only been on a sightseeing tour of suffering and starvation north of Xinyang for two weeks. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>LUOYANG - Thanks to the courageous resistance of the Chinese army in the counties of southern Henan, the Japanese army was defeated and a great victory was achieved. The political department of the war zone, in order to comfort the soldiers on the front line and to comfort the displaced people everywhere, has specially invited the Provincial Action Committee to organize a consolation group to go to the front line to express its condolences. In addition, the Central Relief Committee has been asked to provide relief to southern Henan, and the political departments of the stationed troops have been asked to assist the local government and relief agencies in carrying out relief work as soon as possible.

<p>CHONGQING - Reuters recently learned from responsible sources that the rumor that Britain has agreed to China establishing a consulate in Hong Kong seems to be premature. Ta Kung Pao carried a report this morning that this matter had been agreed to by the British side. It is reported that the Chinese authorities have requested the British side to allow the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong, but this matter is still under discussion and no decision has been made. It is generally believed that the British side is very likely to express its agreement. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Shishi Xinbao reported that the missing China National Aviation Corporation plane flew from Hong Kong to France yesterday morning. When inquiring at the company's office this morning, it was said that the plane was still missing, and no report had been received from the pilot since the plane took off from Hong Kong. Although news from various newspapers said that the plane was a regular passenger plane of China National Aviation Corporation, the company's office in Chongqing said that the plane was not carrying passengers.

<p>Washington, Military circles here have closely studied the announcement from Manila yesterday regarding the recall of Philippine reserve forces for military training. Military personnel stated that this news is in line with the feeling here that Philippine defense preparations should be diligently adjusted. Elichate, the head of the Philippine Resident Commissioner in Washington, recently warned the Filipinos that the situation is becoming increasingly serious and urged them to make preparations. According to reliable sources, this warning by Elichate is also the reason for promoting Philippine preparations. Military circles here have abandoned the previous view that the Philippines is indefensible. Some military personnel even advocate that the United States should pay more attention to the Philippines than to Singapore. (United Press telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington, Philippine economic experts paid close attention yesterday to the news that the United States is setting up a steel mill in Houston, Texas, with US$10 million, recognizing it as a precursor to the shift of the steel industry to the west coast, which is closer to the Philippines' mineral resources. However, experts said that setting up a steel mill in Houston would not greatly help the development of the Philippine mining industry, because the shipping costs from the Philippines to Houston are almost the same as the shipping costs from the Philippines to New York and Baltimore. They also said that the biggest expense is the shipping cost through the Panama Canal. However, setting up a factory in Houston is a trend, so once a factory is also set up on the other side of the canal, the Philippines can economically ship its mineral products.

<p>Washington, The high command now recognizes the infantry as the "Queen of the Army." Although the air force and modern mechanized warfare equipment have attracted the world's attention, the need for the infantry to be up-to-date is still not being ignored. Tanks may be able to break through enemy lines and put enemy reinforcements in a state of panic. Aircraft may be able to fly into the enemy's rear and carry out bombing in areas beyond the range of heavy artillery, but the infantry is still the arm of the army. After all, to advance on enemy positions or hold the front line to wait for friendly forces or retreat, only the infantry can achieve this. One hundred and sixty-two rifles, five thousand and seventy-six rifles, thirty-six 37 mm anti-tank guns, eighty-one light mortars, thirty-six 81 mm mortars, and eight 75 mm tank guns, this number is larger than the old streamlined infantry division. When the military begins an offensive, the streamlined division quickly develops behind the armored division to consolidate the captured positions and transfers the positions to the ordinary division that follows closely behind. The army also believes that since the adoption of the Garand rifle, the power of the infantry has greatly increased, because the recoil of this new rifle is not as strong as that of the Springfield, so soldiers can fire several more rounds a day without feeling overwhelmed. In addition, the current improvement of the infantry is divided into two categories: one is to enable it to reach the front quickly, and the other is to equip it with heavy weapons so that it can attack fiercely when advancing and defend firmly when retreating. In terms of speed, it can be given a streamlined mechanical configuration. In terms of power, it can be achieved by adding heavy weapons such as automatic rapid-firing guns. At present, the US regular army has nine streamlined or triangular infantry divisions, and the National Guard has another eighteen old-fashioned or "square" infantry divisions from the last World War. The nine streamlined infantry divisions have a total of 13,567 people, of which 8,910 are infantry soldiers, and the rest are artillery and other soldiers. Each streamlined division has 144 .30-caliber heavy machine guns, 108 light machine guns, and 36 .50-caliber machine guns. Since the new rifle also has another advantage, namely that the speed has increased and is also more accurate. (United Press telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>London, A senior Soviet official here revealed last night that Germany will not forcibly invade Bulgaria without consulting the Soviet Union. However, Germany has not yet consulted the Soviet Union. It is said that Germany's "showing off its military might" to Bulgaria and its posturing in the Balkans is aimed at intimidating Greece and separately reaching a peace with Italy. As for the rumors that German troops are pouring into Bulgaria in preparation for an attack on Ukraine, in order to "coerce the Soviet Union to provide more assistance to Germany," they were denied. This speculation is quite prevalent here. It is pointed out that this move may enable the Soviet Union and Japan to sign a non-aggression pact, which Tokyo has long desired, but Stalin has been delaying month after month. It is also pointed out that once the threat of a Soviet attack on Manchuria is removed, Japan will be able to begin its southward advance, which, even if it does not engage in war with the United States, will at least restrain the US fleet in the Pacific, which will benefit Germany in any case. When this issue was raised to Soviet officials here, they replied that Germany had agreed with the Soviet Union to consult with the Soviet Union before invading Bulgaria. It was also implied that Germany cannot attack Ukraine at this time, as it would create another enemy. (International News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Tokyo, The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an article stating that the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania has expanded the power of the Axis powers to the Balkans. Germany will do everything in its power to crush Britain, but if Germany believes that the peace of the Balkans requires the maintenance of German troops, it will not hesitate to send troops to Bulgaria, especially since it can now be said that Germany has fully consulted with Bulgaria and the Soviet Union on this matter. Britain may rely on bombing the Romanian oil fields, but it is doubtful whether this move will be effective. German troops will now probably cooperate with Italian troops to control Greece in order to threaten the British naval base in the eastern Mediterranean. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, After the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania, the Romanian government, fearing that Britain might bomb its oil fields, plans to evacuate the people of Ciurgiu, Ploiesti, and Constanta in advance. Detailed methods are currently being considered. Ciurgiu and Ploiesti are both located in the oil fields, while the port of Constanta is the main port for oil exports. The Romanian government has taken various measures in politics and economics to prepare for emergencies, such as strengthening precautions against foreign activities. A curfew is enforced nationwide, and no one is allowed to go out from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am without special permits. The military authorities in Bucharest have notified the people that anyone who goes out during the curfew without a special pass will be punished by military law if caught. The national grain harvest has been sealed by the state to distribute food equally to the military and civilians. Economic activities in all aspects have been expanded to increase production, and 300 farmland tractors recently shipped from Germany have been distributed to farmers in various places to increase land production. Various glycerols are requisitioned for the manufacture of explosives, while the export of various drugs is reduced as much as possible. As for the rumors that Turkish expatriates will leave soon, this statement cannot be confirmed, but the fact that the Turkish embassy was closely guarded by military police this morning is a real situation.

Not only are there various facts to prove it, but Your Excellency has also repeatedly made statements to admit it. Your Excellency presented a note a few months ago stating that it has allowed many German military instructors to go to your country to train your troops with modern tactics and attach various military equipment. In fact, Germany's preparations to use your country's territory for military action have become increasingly obvious. In view of this situation, I have decided to recall the Minister of My Country and all diplomatic personnel." (Havas telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>London – According to well-informed sources, the news that Greece rejected Germany's peace plan is likely accurate. However, sources close to external affairs are unwilling to confirm or deny whether Britain has received such information. It is said that officials will naturally not comment before an announcement is made in Athens. A diplomatic writer here suggested on Sunday that Germany's activities in the Balkans were intended to threaten Greece, predicting that Germany would pressure Greece to cease hostilities and make substantial concessions to Italy. The writer further stated that Germany would only resort to force after diplomatic means had failed. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London – British government sources reported last night that the German ambassador to Greece has presented Greece with the following peace terms between Greece and Italy: (1) Greece will be allowed to retain the territory it currently holds in Albania; (2) Greek troops will demobilize, and Greece will declare neutrality in the European war; (3) Greece requests that British troops withdraw from Greek territory and Greek waters, including the withdrawal of naval and air forces from Crete. Germany guarantees Greece that Italy will not attack Greece again. (International News Service dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Bangkok – A senior government official told visiting reporters today that there has been absolutely no change in British-Thai relations, emphasizing that there is no misunderstanding between the two governments. The official also pointed out that the two governments are, as usual, exchanging intelligence regarding defense preparations in the border areas between Thailand and Malaya. Therefore, the Thai government does not find the reports of increased land and air force deployments on the Malayan border to be unusual. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Bangkok – The Thai Ministry of Propaganda has formally denied reports that Thailand has allowed Japan to use Thai airports. However, the ministry added that negotiations regarding allowing Japanese commercial aircraft to use the French airline route directly from Bangkok to Saigon, instead of the longer route through the Gulf of Siam, have concluded. The Thai Foreign Ministry declared that the Thai peace delegation negotiating with Vietnam in Tokyo was not authorized to discuss any issues unrelated to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. Thai Prime Minister Songgram hosted a banquet last night for General Sumida, head of the Japanese military mission to Vietnam. However, Thai officials remained silent on the purpose of the Japanese delegation's visit to Bangkok, but a Japanese official stated that the Japanese representative had come from Hanoi to consult with Japanese mediators here. General Sumida flew back to Saigon at 8:30 AM today. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">European War Discussions (34): The United States on the Brink of War <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Will the United States participate in the war? This is the significant question everyone is exploring. The following is a translation of the conclusions published in the New York Times on the 21st of last month:</p>
<p>The question of whether the United States can avoid being drawn into the vortex of this European war, which was initially seen as possible, has now become a question of whether it should participate. This shift demonstrates the movement of the war itself and American foreign policy. At the beginning of the war, the United States attempted to maintain neutrality in principle while providing practical assistance to democratic nations, yet claiming to be a non-belligerent. As Italy entered the war, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands fell one after another, France collapsed, Britain suffered severe air raids, merchant ships were repeatedly sunk, and exchange rates against the US dollar plummeted, the appearance of the question changed accordingly, even in principle, neutrality was no longer maintained. President Roosevelt even declared that Britain and the United States were closely linked, sharing the same fate.</p>
<p>According to the President, Germany has two major disadvantages to consider before declaring war on the US: (1) If Germany and the US go to war, German diplomats would not be able to operate in North and South America, preventing them from carrying out propaganda and plotting conspiracies. The US withdrawal of its ambassadors to Germany would not have a great impact. (2) All German and Italian ships docked in the US would be confiscated, and the British fleet could entrust the responsibility of escorting merchant ships to the US, allowing them to focus on fighting the enemy while also gaining fresh naval and air support from the US. Based on these reasons, the President and most people believe that the US can provide full assistance to Britain without being drawn into the war.</p>
<p>However, others argue that the US must keep most of its fleet in the Pacific, and the aircraft production rates of Britain and the US are far behind Germany, making it difficult to catch up before 1942. By then, the Axis powers may have already declared war on the US. If the US enters the war, its supply of arms to Britain would inevitably be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>During the last European war, the US maintained neutrality for three years before participating. This time, just one month after the war began, the US abolished the embargo on arms exports, abandoning neutrality. During the last European war, President Wilson did not declare a close relationship with Britain and France until he was preparing to declare war. Now, President Roosevelt has already declared this. During the last European war, foreigners in the US had varying attitudes towards the belligerent nations. Now, it's different. Countless Poles, anti-Nazi Germans, Italians, Czechs, French, British, Scandinavians, Greeks, Dutch, Belgians, and Irish all unanimously support the policy of aiding Britain.</p>
<p>Senator Vandenberg was originally a staunch isolationist, strongly opposed to intervening in the European war. When Poland was invaded, he strongly advocated for strict enforcement of neutrality laws, opposed the President's proposal to abolish the arms export embargo, and even said that as long as he could speak, he would vehemently oppose American troops being sent abroad to fight.</p>
<p>However, after the British forces suffered setbacks, and the general public became deeply concerned about the potential invasion of Canada, Vandenberg also agreed that the US should send troops to aid Canada if it were invaded. Seeing the occupation of Norway, Denmark, and other small countries, he realized that Hitler's disregard for faith could threaten the entire world, and he resolutely supported the President's policy of providing full support to Britain "short of war."</p>
<p>By December 28th of last year, when the President broadcast his fireside chat, Vandenberg also expressed his agreement, acknowledging the need to contain the power of the Axis countries. Not only that, but he also said that if the US was forced to participate in the war to ensure a just peace, he would be willing to accept the responsibility of guaranteeing it.</p>
<p>In short, the determination of the American people to defend democracy has now become an accepted principle, irreversible. They are currently on the edge of war, calmly watching the dark abyss, and will not be pushed into it, nor will they automatically jump in, as long as they can stand firm on this edge.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Enjoy the Pleasures of Life <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>We should enjoy the pleasures of life in our lives. No matter what kind of work we do, we should always be happy and joyful, so that we can feel the joy of working. There is an old Chinese saying that "one should not open a shop without a smiling face." Indeed, there is truth in this, because how can someone succeed when they are always frowning? The ancient Greeks also had a saying, "A sound mind in a sound body." Therefore, no matter what profession we are in, we must have a healthy body.</p>
<p>However, no one can live without illness. Not to mention those dangerous and serious illnesses, even if there is a little pain—headache, toothache, wind or nerve pain, or menstrual pain—it is very painful. With this kind of pain, we feel disappointed because we cannot enjoy ourselves, cannot attend banquets, and even watching a movie becomes impossible.</p>
<p>But this pain can be ended very quickly, so there is no need to endure it. The fastest and safest way to relieve pain is to swallow one or two Saridon tablets. Within ten minutes, the pain will completely disappear, and our body will feel very comfortable. Saridon is manufactured by Roche Ltd. of Switzerland, so it is absolutely safe and reliable.</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Far East Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious; The US Again Urges Citizens to Evacuate; US Consulate States It Is for the Safety of Citizens; They Should Evacuate as Soon as Possible While Transportation is Available <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday reiterated its advice to American women, children, and American citizens who do not have an essential reason to remain in Shanghai to quickly evacuate and return to the United States "for their own safety and the safety of the nation." The U.S. Consulate General's notice stated that the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai had previously issued a notice to American citizens within its jurisdiction, relaying the Secretary of State's recommendation that citizens evacuate and return to the United States. Now, the State Department has emphasized this recommendation, especially for American women, children, and men who are deemed to have no urgent need to remain here. This recommendation is issued for the safety, convenience, and national security of American citizens and is a necessary preventive measure. The State Department does not intend to send special ships to assist in the evacuation but hopes that American citizens will take advantage of the transportation currently available. The Consulate General, upon receiving the above recommendation, urgently urges the aforementioned three categories of American citizens to heed it and consider returning to the United States.</p>
<p>American Passports to be Replaced</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai announced yesterday (the 13th) that all American passports must be replaced with new passports of a completely different design before April 19th. From April 19th, old passports will be invalid. American citizens planning to depart for the United States before April 10th do not need to replace their passports. The U.S. Consulate has already mailed out passport application forms. American citizens only need to fill them out and mail them back. After receiving all the applications, the U.S. Consulate will notify American citizens individually to come to the Consulate to collect them.</p>
<p>Travel to the Far East is Also Restricted</p>
<p>According to American sources, the U.S. government's actions (recommending that unnecessary American citizens evacuate from the Far East) are entirely preventive measures regarding the situation in the Pacific. One fact proves this: previously, people from the U.S. mainland were not subject to any restrictions when traveling to Hawaii and did not need to show passports. Now, permission from the authorities is required, and an emergency decree has been issued prohibiting women and children from traveling to the Far East. Some American citizens recently returned to the Far East from the United States, attempting to bring their wives and daughters with them, but were unsuccessful due to the restrictions of the law. Even American men who want to come to the Far East without sufficient reason will not be issued passports by the authorities.</p>
<p>New Citizenship Law Recently Promulgated</p>
<p>According to news obtained yesterday from the U.S. Consulate authorities, the new citizenship law announced by the U.S. government took effect on January 23rd. Hundreds of Chinese in this city who have become American citizens will be affected by the law. The new citizenship law promulgated by the U.S. government has detailed provisions regarding naturalization and loss of citizenship. The law does not have a significant impact on American citizens by birth, but foreigners who have become American citizens will lose their American citizenship if they continue to stay in their home country for more than three years without returning to the U.S., except for those who have resided continuously in the United States and U.S. territories for more than twenty-five years. The law came into effect on January 13th, and therefore, some naturalized American citizens will lose their American citizenship within two years. The law also stipulates that if a foreigner who has become an American citizen resides in a foreign country for more than two years and automatically becomes a citizen of that place, their American citizenship will also be lost as a result. This provision is specifically aimed at totalitarian countries, because totalitarian countries often recruit people who have become American citizens into their military.</p>
<p>Market Rumors Run Rampant; Fluctuations Began Yesterday</p>
<p>In addition, after the U.S. Consul in Shanghai issued a statement recommending the evacuation of American citizens, rumors arose in the city, claiming that British authorities here had also taken similar steps, recommending that British citizens evacuate. However, after investigation by reporters, it was found to be completely baseless and untrue. However, after the occurrence of this rumor, the most affected was the stock market. Yesterday, the market experienced countless changes, and stock prices plummeted, reaching lows not seen in several weeks. Although the situation improved slightly in the afternoon, the increase was minimal. The largest declines in stock prices were seen in Wheelock and International, with the former falling from 103 yuan to 92 yuan and the latter from 24.75 yuan to 21 yuan. Other stocks also uniformly declined. At the same time, the exchange rate of the legal tender continued to be stable, with the U.S. exchange rate closing at 5 16/7. The silver dollar also declined slightly.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters today (the 13th) that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association will use postal ballots to elect Chinese directors to the Council because about half of the members are not in Shanghai, so a general meeting cannot be held. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Chinese Ratepayers have not held any meetings. It is reported that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has not yet received any notices recommending new candidates for Chinese directors, so the current five Chinese directors are expected to be re-elected this term.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Border Checks Between Two Concessions Become Stricter <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the movement of criminals, the police departments of the two concessions have recently become extremely strict in checking pedestrians at the border areas. Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police Department, assisted by French troops stationed in Shanghai, are stationed at the border areas of Route Ghisi, Xujiahui, and Avenue Haig, Route Say Zoong, Avenue Foch, and Avenue du President Doumer day and night, selectively inspecting suspicious individuals. On the Public Concession side, after the discovery of real and fake guns on buses and trams, attention is paid to vehicles passing through the two concessions. Detectives are dispatched to board vehicles and search passengers one by one.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce office, after being broken into and having some documents taken the day before yesterday, is of great concern to the business community in the city.

All important documents had been moved there earlier, and assistant secretary Cao Zhigong was handling daily work in Hong Kong. The association now considers that various commercial goods transported from this city to Free China must hold a certificate from the association to be sold, and for the convenience and freedom of work, it has decided to move a portion of the affairs previously handled by the Shanghai office to Hong Kong to continue its operations, for the benefit of commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e41">China Determined to Prevent Japan's Southern Advance (Continued) – Mr. Song Ziwen's Speech in New York <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Under these circumstances, the most reasonable step for Japan would be to withdraw its troops and transport ships from China. For the past six months, Japan has repeatedly made peace proposals to China, and its conditions have become increasingly accommodating, and with good reason. This is because the Japanese have realized that there is no hope of eliminating the Chinese army. On the other hand, Japan is under pressure from time, and the move to advance south is also urgent. So why not make peace with China first, so that the troops in China can be transferred to the South Pacific? If the attempt on Singapore succeeds, there will be unlimited resources such as oil, tin, rubber, rice, cotton, etc. available, and the Burma Road can also be cut off, then it will not be too late to plan for China later. Japan believes that it may be possible to give China generous terms now, and once Singapore falls, all agreements will become waste paper. This wishful thinking seems very reasonable, but can the Chinese not see what the Japanese see? We deeply know that after most of the Japanese troops withdraw from China, it will give us a temporary opportunity to rest, but once Singapore falls, it will not only be a disaster for Britain, but also a misfortune for us, and ultimately perhaps a misfortune for the United States as well. The peace talks proposed by Japan at present are only a temporary truce, which is only beneficial to Japan. Therefore, we recognize that the Sino-Japanese War is part of the current universal war, so permanent peace must also be part of universal world peace, otherwise we can only continue to fight. But from now on, our fight is not only to maintain our own position, but also to put pressure on the Japanese so that they cannot withdraw their troops to engage in the southern advance.</p>
<p>Final Victory is Guaranteed</p>
<p>When China engaged in the war of resistance, it encountered two major problems: a lack of money and a lack of aircraft. In the three years of destructive war, its most prosperous industrial areas were either destroyed by artillery fire or looted. Most of its transportation has been cut off, yet China still has to support millions of soldiers and guerrillas. The foreign exchange rate of China's legal tender has fallen to one-fifth of the pre-war exchange rate, while its domestic price has risen six times. Fortunately, Britain and the United States lent a helping hand in this difficult time, lending huge sums of money. According to someone who recently came here from China, when Roosevelt announced that he would lend 100 million yuan to China, the reaction was like lightning. The suffering and depressed Chinese people were greatly excited after hearing this news, and the hope of final victory was once again guaranteed.</p>
<p>The People are Severely Poisoned by the Japanese</p>
<p>The world is familiar with the horror caused by indiscriminate bombing of British cities, towns, and villages, but at the very least, Britain still has anti-aircraft guns, air defense balloons, fighter planes, and bombers to defend it and retaliate. However, the situation in China is completely different. Japanese planes can fly freely over the skies of our cities and villages, selecting targets for bombing, without encountering any danger of retaliation. For example, during the mad bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes on May 3rd and 4th, 1939, the number of civilians killed, injured, and burned to death reached 30,000. This number is more than the total number of people who died in the bombardment of London in the past six months. Japan is a master of abusing terms. When millions of Japanese soldiers are either dead or injured, and millions of Japanese soldiers are fighting, they still claim that the war in China is only an incident.</p>
<p>China Will Not Fail in its Mission to the United States</p>
<p>In this world war, the United States may never become a belligerent country, but regardless of whether Americans want to hear this, we will still regard ourselves as allies of the United States. Guarding the fortress in the Pacific for the country. Since I came to the United States, I have deeply felt the friendliness of the American people. I believe that the friendship of the American people towards the Chinese is not entirely out of sympathy for the victims of aggression, nor is it merely a recognition of the results of our heroic defense. I think there are still other reasons that make Americans friendly to us, that is, you have a deeply rooted instinct in your hearts, believing that you can trust a great nation to prevent the scourge of war from approaching your country. If this great nation can survive through the difficulties, it will join hands with you to enable your descendants to live safely in the Pacific region. With God's blessing and your assistance, we will surely not fail in our mission. (The End)</p>
<p>The Problem of the "Special Police" Organization is Being Addressed with Both Hands, First Discussing Uniforms and Police Station Locations, and a Final Decision is Expected Within the Month</p>
<p>According to news obtained yesterday, "Special Police Chief" Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Chief" Kelisha, recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council, have begun to negotiate the details of the "Special Police" organization. These negotiations are expected to reach a final decision on March 1st. Although the "Municipal Government" has not yet "approved" Kelisha as "Deputy Chief," this "acceptance" is only a "routine matter." Once Chen Gongbo returns to Shanghai, he can officially "accept." According to a police spokesperson, although Chen Gongbo is not in Shanghai, it has no impact on the current stage of negotiations. Once the agreement is signed by both parties, the remaining issues, such as uniforms, police station locations, etc., can be carried out by Pan Zhijie and Kelisha before the "Special Police" are formally established. As for the issue of micro-taxes on roads built beyond the boundaries, it remains a mystery. Although a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council claimed that the two parties would soon begin negotiations on the issue, he refused to make detailed comments on the matter.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Issues Not Yet Resolved</p>
<p>(13th) Morning According to well-informed sources, Chen Gongbo will return to Shanghai from Ningbo early next week, which is expected to allow negotiations on the establishment of the new police force in the Joint District of Western Shanghai to continue to progress. An official of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated yesterday morning that the issue of tax collection in the Joint District has not yet been resolved, but the two parties will soon discuss this issue to continue the talks that were previously held, it is believed that an independent tax bureau will be set up in the Joint District to collect taxes in the area, it is heard that the collected funds will be used exclusively to maintain the new police force and public services in the area.</p>
<p>Hopes to Extend Control Over Water and Electricity in the Western District</p>
<p>Residents of roads built beyond the boundaries in Western Shanghai have been paying taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council and obtaining the use of water and electricity. The electricity in the area is supplied by the American-owned Shanghai Western Electric Company. Since 1935, the company has had the exclusive right to supply electricity to the area for thirty years. Recently, since the establishment of the Western Shanghai Police Authority Agreement on February 1st, the Japanese side has recognized that the area is in fact under the jurisdiction of the "Municipal Government." Although the issue of taxation has not yet been resolved, the Japanese side's attempt to seize the water and electricity rights in the area is already evident in Japanese newspapers. According to the Continental News, which was published yesterday, on the one hand, it is inciting residents of the area to resist taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and on the other hand, it is instigating the municipal authorities to have the water and electricity in the area supplied by the China Central Water and Electricity Company.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Chinese landowners Fang Jiahe, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, Wen De, and others suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for collecting Fangdan land tax in the Consular Court, according to Langge, secretary of the Consular Corps, the hearing has been scheduled to continue on Tuesday (18th) or Wednesday (19th). According to the previous trials of the case, the plaintiffs' lawyer Liu Shifang and the Shanghai Municipal Council's lawyer Bolliang had fierce debates. The reasons held by the plaintiff are based on the land charter and the judgment of the First Special District Court, which states that Fangdan holders can be exempted from paying donations. The Shanghai Municipal Council itself is restricted by the charter and has no reason to violate the regulations and collect Fangdan land tax. On the defendant's side, it firmly stated that those who hindered the Shanghai Municipal Council from collecting donations were the Chinese authorities, the court, and the taxpayers' association. Bolliang also stated that at the next hearing, he would be able to present evidence to prove that the judgment of the First Special District Court was the result of "political pressure." He is determined to fight for the final victory in the century-old war between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the taxpayers, so it is expected that there will still be a fierce debate at the next hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Overseas Chinese Education in Honolulu (II) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese schools in Honolulu, many have requested subsidies from the central government. Any such subsidies should be used to increase teachers' salaries to solve this problem. The second problem is that some overseas Chinese schools use the Hakka dialect for teaching, and the teaching materials are not standardized. In the spring of 1938, Mrs. Zhao Yuanren and her daughter, Miss Zhao Rulan, opened a Chinese Mandarin supplementary school in Honolulu. This school uses phonetic symbols as a teaching tool, and the students are of all ages. However, they made great progress in a short period of time. Mrs. Han Qianghua, who succeeded Zhao, also worked hard. It seems that the Hakka dialect teaching will completely disappear in the near future under the influence of the promotion of Mandarin. As for unified teaching materials, we still need the education administration to impose stricter regulations to achieve faster results.</p>
<p>The University of Hawaii is the highest institution of learning in Honolulu. The Department of Chinese Language was established in 1935, which is the only place for overseas Chinese in our land to study the culture and academics of the motherland. The department offers many courses related to Sinology, such as (1) History of Chinese Cultural Contact, (2) Ancient Chinese History, (3) History of Chinese Culture, (4) Sinological Bibliography and Research Methods, (5) Chinese History, (6) Chinese Literature, (7) Chinese Literature in English Literature, (8) Chinese Philosophy and Art, (9) History of Chinese Music and Its Appreciation, (10) Chinese Philology, (11) Intensive Chinese, (12) Taoism, (13) Chinese Philosophy, (14) Oriental Philosophy and other courses. Many overseas Chinese students study in the college and are very interested in achieving great results. Before the establishment of a self-run higher overseas Chinese school (i.e., a school above the junior college level) in Honolulu, the Department of Chinese Language of the Oriental Institute has benefited the overseas Chinese students in studying our country's inherent culture. However, the current problem is how to communicate with domestic higher education and academic research institutions through the Chinese Department of the Oriental Institute of the University of Hawaii. In peacetime, we must fully play the function of communication, and in special times, the government of our country may allocate special funds to set up lectures in the college to promote the culture and academics of the motherland so that the overseas Chinese students will benefit more. In general, the education of overseas Chinese in Honolulu is still in the development stage. Both the quantity and the substance are not ideal, and it needs to be improved. In the past ten years, in Honolulu, in addition to the five overseas Chinese schools that have been approved or filed by the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, as well as one or two overseas Chinese education talks and student achievement competitions presided over by the Consul of Honolulu, local overseas Chinese education institutions and people have had very little contact with domestic education administrative agencies. Contact should be promoted in many ways to make it gradually closer. Then, the improvement and enrichment of teachers, equipment, and teaching materials in overseas Chinese schools will be solved easily. Honolulu is a paradise in the Pacific Ocean with a beautiful environment. The overseas Chinese in the land have already been blessed with material wealth. If they can be given education, today's overseas Chinese students will be the mainstay of the future overseas Chinese community, and their contribution to the motherland will be even greater. In this process of resistance and construction, I hope that the famous people at home and abroad will pay attention to it. (End)</p>

<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>I remember many similar stories in "Stories":</p>
<p>"A person finds a small mouse in the house and doesn't care.</p>
<p>Later, the little mouse becomes a big mouse, and he still doesn't care.</p>
<p>Later, it becomes many big mice, and he still doesn't care.</p>
<p>Later, the mice bite things and hurt toes, then he jumps up; but it's too late!"</p>
<p>Originally, "Small negligence leads to big trouble," and "Carelessness" naturally leads to "losing Jingzhou."</p>
<p>However, now there are too many knowingly wrong "bright-eyed blind people" who are committing crimes. The "vocal cords" are not broken, but they pretend to be dumb first: "I won't speak!" If a handgun is found on a public bus, wouldn't everyone be willing to go "into luggage" as suspects?</p>
<p>Everyone pretends to "not see," "not speak," and then "not move"...</p>
<p>"Destroy it while it's a snake, what will you do when it becomes a serpent?" We've seen robberies on the bus.</p>
<h3 id="e76">A Record of Collecting Tuition Fees <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>Mr. Principal rushed in, saying that the bank had called and asked someone to quickly help collect tuition fees; otherwise, they wouldn't accept them, and the bank was full of people paying fees, and they had no way to handle it. So, under the direction of Mr. Principal, I immediately rushed to the bank.</p>
<p>The bank was packed with people; those who couldn't get inside could only stand on the sidewalk by the door, looking like they were selling square meters. So I had no choice but to be "blocked."</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I squeezed in, but as a "bumpkin," I couldn't find a way to the counter, so I had to ask the police officer to take me. But this gentleman first scanned me from head to toe with lightning-like eyes, then aggressively asked me what I was doing. I said I was there to collect fees, and he became even more suspicious. After questioning the people inside, it seemed that he confirmed my identity as Mr. Gao from a certain school, who was indeed there to collect fees. Only then did that police officer allow me to enter a side door locked with a DAMM tumbler lock.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was my own psychological effect, or if the bank employees hadn't seen poor people before, but as soon as I stepped into the copper railing, dozens of eyes accustomed to seeing banknotes stared straight at me, emitting a particularly powerful glow.</p>
<p>When I walked into the small room in the back designated by Mr. Manager, I felt strange, "Does a bank also have a kitchen?"...</p>
<p>But as I was thinking about it, before my feet had completely crossed the threshold of the small room, a not-so-low question came from behind me—"Is this kind of person here to help collect fees?"</p>
<p>I turned around and noticed an elderly girl asking a male employee. Her face was made up a bit comically, almost like a "beautiful and moving" actress after makeup. So I wanted to take another look at her, but it was terrible. Not only was she not embarrassed, but she became even fiercer than me. Her eyebrows, like two lines, drooped, and her eyes, as big as longan beads, glared at me. This made me scared, "Will I offend the gods today?" I secretly worried. At the same time, I blamed myself for wearing this unlucky yellow and gray coat, asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Walking into the back room, parents were already gathered there. Because my job was to find receipts, it was the first hurdle. Without it, the bank employees couldn't collect fees. So the parents surged into the room, almost suffocating me. People climbed on top of each other, standing very high. I had no choice but to announce a "suspension of distribution" to coerce them. If they didn't back out, I wouldn't issue them. Finally, this condition was met, and I could continue.</p>
<p>Slowly, things got on track, and the crowding gradually shifted from our side to the counter. The place for paying money became lively—many hands pulled on the copper railing, so tired that the steadily lying bronze railing also creaked, and even the loud voices of the tellers were drowned out by the crowd outside today.</p>
<p>One parent muttered to himself: "Giving them money, and they still pretend to be stupid and put on airs!" He turned around and asked me why the school wasn't collecting fees itself this year. I told him, "It's inconvenient!"</p>
<p>It was almost time for lunch, and the crowd gradually thinned. Only then did I realize that four children were still waiting there. I asked them, and they said that someone had paid their tuition on their behalf, took the money, and hadn't paid it yet. Actually, this guy had already "slipped away." At this time, the children realized they had been cheated, and they started crying loudly, but it was useless; the money couldn't be cried back!</p>
<p>The clock pointed to two o'clock, and the crowd began to surge again. Some people were arguing, saying they had overpaid tuition, and others were dripping with sweat, unable to speak, only hot steam rising into the air; still others said their pockets had been picked. It became lively again.</p>
<p>After four o'clock, the bank pulled down the iron gate, and the employees felt happy—they could finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>For the sake of children's education, how many people are busy. This kind of fee collection will have to be done for several more days, but I can't guess how many more times it will be collected in the future?</p>

<p>— Qin Shouhe</p>
<p>He and Principal Hou were cousins ​​and shared common interests, so of course there was nothing they couldn't talk about. That night, Director Ma invited Principal Hou to his home to discuss how to carry out the matter. Director Ma's wife was also specially invited to attend.</p>
<p>Director Ma first told Principal Hou the details of the meeting at the Governor's Office just now. Only because he was eager to see the matter succeed, he did not mention his doubts about whether Yuan Baofan had married, and even deliberately helped Yuan Baofan explain a few words, so as to dispel the suspicion of his fifty-three-year-old cousin.</p>
<p>"Things are very good." Mrs. Ma echoed her husband's words: "It's enough for a female student to marry a garrison commander!"</p>
<p>A thin smile appeared on Principal Hou's gaunt face, which resembled a dried tangerine.</p>
<p>"Yes, things are very good." She habitually said in a very low voice: "Last month, Luo Xiangqi's father also wrote a letter asking me to find a position for Xiangqi after graduation, or to stay at the alma mater and do some work, just hoping to still provide food and accommodation, nothing else. Because this old man has been unemployed for three years, and his son is suffering from lung disease and is recuperating at a relative's home in Hangzhou, the family is in very difficult circumstances..."</p>
<p>"Then this matter is easy to discuss!" Director Ma excitedly interjected.</p>
<p>"The problem is not with her family, but with herself." Principal Hou shook her head and said, "Because this girl has a very gentle appearance but a very proud heart. A few days ago, I found her a tutoring job, with a salary of thirty yuan a month, but she insisted on not doing it, saying that she didn't want to serve the children of rich families; she only hoped to be a primary school teacher, earn a few dollars to help her father, and after her father had a job or her brother recovered, she still wanted to save some money herself to continue her studies. So if you directly discuss this matter with her, I think it's unlikely to succeed." (30)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Eating Apprentice's Rice <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Liu</p>
<p>After becoming an apprentice, of course, you want to have a bowl of rice to eat at your master's place in the future. Logically, we should say eating "master's rice" or "father's rice." But no, although there are those who eat "master's rice" and "father's rice," the black-hearted masters who "eat apprentice's rice" are even more numerous.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, when you are an apprentice, you finish your apprenticeship in three years. During these three years, you listen to the master's commands: old-fashioned shop apprentices serve the masters, sweep the floor, and do errands. This is a traditional custom; apprentices learning a craft have to cook and wash vegetables. Although these are not explicitly stipulated, if you don't do these, you will get "reheated tofu skin," without a doubt.</p>
<p>Now rice is expensive, and it's really unaffordable to raise an apprentice, but hiring a guest teacher or master, the salary and meals are even more considerable. If the shop wants to hire a maid, that's even more obvious. Compared to that, taking in apprentices is really the cheapest thing. Black-hearted masters see it this way, so they generously take in apprentices; but on the other hand, they shatter the rice bowls of guest masters. Apprentices are taken in, and because they are there to learn, they naturally don't get any salary. Saying things like shoe money and haircut money, those are really paltry amounts.</p>
<p>Therefore, some small craft shops use a master's wife, a master, and an apprentice to fill the space. If the master's wife can do some work, that's of course a good thing, but nine out of ten master's wives like to put on airs, so the apprentice has to act as a "big-footed nanny." Furthermore, this puts a distance between them and learning the craft. The masters are so smart; they explain this kind of thing in a tactful way: "Endure hardship to be above others!" At the same time, they are used to saying, "Wasn't that how we masters started? Honestly, if you don't suffer this kind of hardship, you won't want to improve."</p>
<p>Then there are other "apprentice rice eaters." They think that three years of apprenticeship is still too short (actually, for real skill learning, it only takes about a year to train very well), so they add it to five years (that's how silk floss is turned now). During these five years, even if the apprentice quickly learns the skills of the trade, they won't get even a small wage; in the end, they just help the master earn more money. After five years, if the apprentice can't find a place to go, and they still work under the master, then the wages they earn as apprentices are subject to things like "four-six split." The master, who doesn't lift a finger, gets the big share.</p>
<p>Although there are now interns and work-study students, etc., in Shanghai, where life is like a ten-layer cake, "eating apprentice's rice" still occupies a thick layer!</p>

<h3 id="e79">A Day in the Life of Li Qinian <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>If it wasn't a night shoot the day before, Miss Li Qinian would definitely get up very early. Although the environment of Yihua Company is not a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, it is spacious and sparsely populated, and the air is very fresh. She has to play here for a while every day on the open space, such as jumping, skipping rope, running, and riding a bicycle. Back in the house, the old nanny she brought from Hong Kong has prepared a cup of hot milk for her. Sometimes, there are also fresh eggs and fruits, but her breakfast is very simple, almost always a cup of milk and a few biscuits.</p>
<p>After breakfast, she begins to sort out the letters from fans sent by the tea boy in the morning. These letters are of all kinds of natures. Most of them are letters asking for photos, and some are asking about her new works. Once she opened a letter and saw the words "I want to commit suicide" glaring at her, which startled Miss Li. Looking down, she saw the words "If you don't send me a photo" written below.</p>
<p>From many letters, she selects about ten and answers them herself. The rest are written by her secretary, Miss Chen Fengming, according to Miss Li's intentions, and then she signs her name. Dealing with these fans' letters takes her about two hours a day.</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper is one of her main tasks every morning. She subscribes to the Shen Bao herself, and the rest of the newspapers are borrowed from the propaganda department, because the propaganda department has marked all the movie-related texts in the newspaper, so she can save a lot of valuable time.</p>
<p>After reading the newspaper, she rereads her script. At this time, she refuses to see guests, because she believes that this is an important preparation for her to improve, and she must devote herself to it, and no circumstances should hinder her from doing so at this time.</p>
<p>If there are no guests, she eats lunch with her secretary, etc. If there are guests, the dishes are more abundant. About three days a week, she still eats purely Cantonese-style dishes. Her nanny can cook very good Cantonese food, and sometimes colleagues come to her place to eat real Cantonese food or Cantonese soup.</p>
<p>After lunch, she rests for a while and reads books, or reads the second batch of letters every day. Sometimes she also chats with her colleagues about the sea and the sky. At this time, she will laugh and giggle like a child, without any hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Usually, filming always starts in the afternoon, so when it comes to filming days, she dresses up on time and reports to the set on time. She believes that being late is a disgrace to civilized people, so she advises others to be punctual, and she herself never misses a point. This is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>On the set, she obeys the director's instructions and also humbly accepts teaching. Sometimes she occasionally raises questions to discuss with the director, which are also well-organized and do not make affirmative statements.</p>
<p>If there is no filming in the afternoon, she reads books in her own house. Now she has hired a female singing teacher and a Cantonese opera musician, because she is not only a movie star, but also a red singer in the Southern Opera world. However, after coming to Shanghai, she has almost neglected Cantonese opera due to various private affairs, so now she spends at least one hour a day reviewing various Cantonese operas. If she has the opportunity in the future, she may perform on stage in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sometimes she goes out to watch movies or Peking opera. As for dance halls, she says she doesn't like them, so she rarely goes. Usually, after eating dinner, she reads books and newspapers, finishes writing the diary of the day, and goes to bed at about ten o'clock.</p>
<p>However, the life of a film person is often entangled in work and lacks order. For example, filming all night and sleeping during the day, etc. The description of Miss Li's daily life written above refers to days when there is not much filming. Recently, she is filming "The Merry Widow," so she has to adapt her life to the work.</p>
<h3 id="e80">My Views on Xun Huisheng <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ying</p>
<p>Xun's strength lies in having drama in her heart. Every word and every note is full of drama. Every move has meaning. Although her voice is not as good as Mei, Cheng, and Shang, her skill surpasses them. Therefore, in the "Five Flower Caves," which was jointly recorded by the four famous female roles, Xun's voice and singing are not weaker than Mei and are even better than Shang and Cheng. Her spoken parts are better because of her soft and sweet voice. Her tone is euphemistic and has a unique charm. The (sniffing and sad chanting…) Southern Bangzi in "Returning the Pearl"; the (for someone else) Siping Melody in "A Dream of Red Mansions"; the Xipi Yuan Ban in "Jealous Woman's Tips" (saw on the east wall); the Er Liu in "Hairpin Phoenix" (see you (record)), listening to it can make people intoxicated and fascinated. In the last ten years, her tragic melodies have been particularly moving. For example, the Erhuang Sanban in "Fragrant Silk Ribbon"; and the dying Kuai Sanyan in "Hairpin Phoenix," listening to it brings sadness and makes people cry, so it's no wonder that when Xun performs this, many female guests in the audience have red eyes and wet handkerchiefs. One night, I played the "Mu Kezhai" records of Mei and Xun twice each and listened carefully. I felt that Mei's spoken parts were rich in tonal brilliance, while Xun's spoken parts were full of dramatic emotion. Mei is blessed by nature, while Xun has superb skills. Closing my eyes and listening to Xun's spoken parts, it's as if it's the voice and tone of a little girl, which is something that Mei lacks. Mei has a rich and grand style, while Shang excels in boldness; Cheng's cold and enchanting style is difficult for other female roles to learn; Xun's charming, enchanting, tragic, and humorous style is not the forte of Mei, Shang, and Cheng. Mei has "Farewell My Concubine," Cheng has "Nie Yinniang," and Shang has "Lin Si Niang" in sword dance, Xun, although she doesn't have these, can tread on high-soled shoes. Mei's tragedy is like "Life and Death Hate," Cheng's tragedy is like "Green Frost Sword" and "Green Jade Hairpin," and Shang's "Pearl Fan" all tell about the affairs between husband and wife, while Xun's tragedy is mostly biased towards romantic debts. If Xun weren't a "wise" and "great" person, how could she achieve this?</p>
<p>Some people criticize Hui Sheng for not singing Fan Erhuang when singing the "Jade Hall Spring" escort scene, saying that Hui Sheng is not good at singing against the melody. In fact, Xun's Qingyi foundation is not as good as Mei, Cheng, and Shang. How could she not sing against the melody? In my section "Jingchai Ji," I sang a section of the Spirit and saved it by singing against the melody. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Nightingale and Butterfly Love <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Xinde</p>
<p>A film like "Nightingale and Butterfly Love," just looking at the title, seems to be worth watching, especially since the leading actors are Bing Crosby, Mary Martin, and Basil Rathbone. However, after watching it, it is inevitable to be disappointed. Perhaps people who like to listen to singing films will be satisfied, because there are "seven famous songs" in the film. However, in my opinion, calling it a movie is ultimately not a news film!</p>
<p>What is the story of "Nightingale and Butterfly Love"? It seems to satirize the shamelessness of a famous composer, because all his works are ghostwritten by unknown writers. These unknown writers are Bing Crosby and Mary Martin, and that famous person, without a doubt, is Basil Rathbone.</p>
<p>For such a plot, what we should see on the screen is how Basil Rathbone deceives the public, how he oppresses unknown people, and how unknown people struggle hard and then achieve success. However, the screenwriter is determined to turn this play into a comedy, but turns the character of Bing Crosby into a philandering playboy. For example, in the first half, when Bing Crosby first meets Mary Martin in the apartment, his appearance really makes people feel bad. And the "stalking" section later on the train is not clever either. The director's technique can only be said to be mediocre, and in some places, it is still muddled and cannot give the audience a clear concept.</p>
<p>As for the acting skills of each person, Bing Crosby originally couldn't act, and it is undoubtedly "beyond his ability" to play such an important role. Mary Martin is better, but there is nothing outstanding about her. Basil Rathbone is really wasted in this film. Not only does he not have any scenes to do, but the personality of this role is not very suitable either.</p>

<p>(Mr. Hua Nan Zheng asks) I work in a factory, and there are no female employees in the factory; but every night after sleeping, my genitals must act strangely. Is there any good method?</p>
<p>(Answer) Remove desires, do appropriate exercise, read more self-cultivation texts, and do not make bad friends.</p>
<p>(Mr. Peng Kan Zhi asks) There is a lot of white dandruff on my head, and it is very itchy. It has been like this for more than three years. What kind of disease is this, and how to treat it?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is probably ringworm. Wash it with medicated soap and then rub it with Jiufu Company's Bailing Oil.</p>
<p>(Mr. Yao Ming asks) Every night after sleeping, I must talk in my sleep. Is there a way to prevent this?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is because the brain cannot rest sufficiently. It is best to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth before going to bed; and do not eat too much for dinner.</p>
