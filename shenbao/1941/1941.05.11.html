<p>倫敦　中國法幣續有起色、此間人士以為、此乃上海方面因斯行復業、且料實力增强的平準基金會、不久能恢復其積極支持、空頭乃相率補進所致、倫敦之東方銀行家相信、平準基金會能在技術上會同香港美銀行之一、行使其職務、無需等候其美籍委員之任命、但料該會不致有倉促之行動、今日本方繼續獨攬輸出業、而戰具之購置、又使輸入增多、故貿易平衡、當然不利於中國法幣、惟近來貨幣不為貿易所決電矣、（十日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>逼近戰爭邊沿的美國動態</h3>
<p>美國之日益逼近戰爭邊沿，已成舉世所共見之事實，今後歐戰局勢倘仍照目前形態繼續演進，或南太平洋上終於發生大家所熟知的一慕，則預料美國和侵略國間的正面衝突殆將無可避免。</p>
<p>單就歐戰來講，自上月杪羅斯福總統宣佈擴大中立巡邏範圍，並明言「他日如有必要，美艦儘可駛入戰區」之後，護航問題顯已成爲全世界視綫集中的焦點。關於此事，不但華盛頓各富局已一再發出露骨表示，無疑地，美國海軍本身在事實上也正在從事必要的準備；何况在參議院即將正式辯論護航案之際，一方已有衆議院的通過「徵用軸心商船案」，一方更有政府當局之逮捕德義僑民，據聞美國當局已開始對於德義兩國旅美記者，船員以及其他可疑之人，實施「閃電式的搜捕」：這些舉措足以昭示美國與軸心間的關係，已到短兵相接的階段，同時更可以看出美國朝野確已有破釜沉舟，不惜一戰的決心。</p>
<p>護航辦法一旦實施，緊隨而來的當然便是軸心國方面的武力侵犯，因為德國當局早已一再揚言；「凡駛入德方所劃戰區之一切船隻，連美國軍艦在內，均將遭德方擊沉」。因此，不談護航則已，茍談護航，便須預先考慮到最惡劣的塲合，亦即考慮到參戰的可能，此所以美國自羅斯福總統以次各當局，近日疊連發表警闢演說，期以喚醒美國人民對於當前危機的注意和認識，質言之，華盛頓人士乃欲使全國瞭解英國若果戰敗，美國以及美洲大陸其他各國，均將難逃遭受軸心侵略的厄運，因此，與其等待英國失敗後自身被迫應戰，莫若此際盡量援助英國，使之不敗，使之制勝，以避免或减少美國直接被侵的危機；萬一因援英而致牽入戰渦，其代價也比他日自身應戰時為輕，因為今日參戰尙是英美合作之局，而他日應戰則將成為單獨抵抗的危險關頭。</p>
<p>觀於美國孤立派的依然頑强作梗，料想護航案在通過國會之前，尙須經過一番熱烈爭辯，但若翻閱連日美國若干要人所發出的「炸彈演說」，世人却又不難想像到美艦護航之議，甚至直接參戰之議，在美國一般輿論之前，已有五成以上的成熟，因為茍非然者，以身居現在陸海兩部部長的史汀生諾克斯二氏，斷斷乎不能發出像日前那樣坦率大膽的言論。</p>
<p>史汀生上校除公開主張利用海軍使軍火安全經過海洋運交英國外，並剴切說明美國茍欲保持自由　安全，環繞西半球的整個海洋，必須永在美國自己或友邦的管轄之下，否則美國便無法與侵略國的陸軍相隔離。此在諾克斯海長則一方響應史氏主張，聲明海軍已有準備，足以執行護航工作，一方更宣佈美國所有之一切資源，包括財政上實業上貿易上人力上及生產上的一切巨大資源，決供一「最高目的，之用，此最高目的，即是「使彼在大西洋保障美洲大陸的英國海軍，不致被公然與美國爲敵之國家所毀滅」。</p>
<p>美國政府現任軍政最高當局的表示如此，同時在野要人和一般輿論的見解，除少數例外在所不免外，往往比較政府當局還要積極，還要澈底；例如共和黨領袖威爾基一再批評現行巡邏辦法，尙嫌不足，堅決主張必須護航，衆議院海軍委員會主席文生亦具同感，此在弗洛利達州參議員披潑爾則熊度尤為急進，主張協同英國佔領大西洋上葡屬亞梭爾羣島綠角羣島，及法屬西菲洲達加爾港諸地，以期先發制人，其對於遠東，更要求「派一等飛機五十架，夷東京爲平地」，想見其能、度之激烈。</p>
<p>這許多言論已足夠反映美國民族今日的一般心理，如果再加上美國艦隊的局部動員，一百四十萬陸軍部隊的舉行空前大演習，以及全國飛機廠之決定在一九四三年以前趕造飛機八萬架諸事實，世人對於今後美國動向的趨歸，似乎已可母庸再抱絲毫疑念，吾人所唯一關切而不能已於言者，厥爲希望美國切記過去的敎訓，貫澈「爭制機先」的原則，不論何種援助，絕對小可等到民治陣綫再度受挫或侵略陣綫再度囂張的時候，然後再來付諸實施，須知一小時的躭延，便等於若干噸戰具的沉沒海底，若干英國工廠之遭受炸燬，或前綫若干據點之發生動搖，願賢明的美國民族在羅斯福總統領導之下，當機立斷，迅赴事機！</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（五三）　希特勒　覬覦近東的原因</h3>
<p>近代戰爭沒有煤油就無法推動。飛機，軍艦，戰車，砲車，運輸汽車，要是沒有煤油作爲燃料，便一動都不能動，還能談得到作戰麽？希特勒覬覦近東，在軍略上的原因雖不止一端，但其主因還是脫不了煤油問題。當然，他在控制羅馬尼亞以後，那里的油藏已可爲他所用，但是事實上，在這次戰爭中，油的消耗量着實可觀，最好伊拉克的油田也能歸入德國掌握，最少限度，也得使它不爲英國所用，减低英國海軍在地中海上的威力。至於近東的煤油概况與此次歐戰的關係，茲說明如下：</p>
<p>全世界煤油產量，最多要算美國，佔總數百分之六十，每年產量約爲二萬萬八千萬噸。蘇俄與委內瑞拉產量各佔百分之十。所以這三國產量就佔全世界百分之八十。荷屬東印度及墨西哥每年各產六百萬噸。希特勒徵發之下的羅馬尼亞油產，每年也在六百萬噸左右。再向東，伊拉克年產四百萬噸，伊朗一千萬噸。</p>
<p>希特勒進攻近東是一種手段，他的最後目標，當然還在英國身上，那沒英德兩國的油產情形，我們不得不先行明瞭。英國可說一些沒有油產，惟其海軍强盛，獨覇海權，運油船噸數很鉅，得以在海上自由來往。即在承平之時，英國每，年所消耗的煤油，百分之六十來自大西洋對岸。自從德軍在歐陸接一連二的攻陷各大城市以來，歐洲的油市塲，早經結束，因之英國自美國輸人的爲數更鉅。在必要的時候，英國又能由海道，從東方的伊拉克和荷屬東印度等地的獲得供給。其運輸路綫爲地中海或繞道好望角。全世界煤池的消耗，比之戰前並未見增，而且因爲各國竭力統制的關係，倒反較爲减少了。</p>
<p>無論在任何情况之下，美國的煤油產量及其地下蘊藏之富，總是高踞首位。而且即在戰前，煤油過剩的嚴重問題，迄無解決的辦法。爲了這種緣故，只要英國的海軍能把握住海權，煤油的供給決不至於發生困難。如以運油船而論，英國原在世界是數一數二的，現且英國擁有挪威國的運油船多艘，其噸數之鉅，在全世界上算起來位居第三。至於美國的運油船，比之英國雖較遜一籌，但是幫同運油至英，也是毫無問題的。在油的運輸方面來講，英國確比德國佔有優勢。</p>
<p>德國的煤油供給情形如何呢？她與英國不同，在德國的領土內尙有若干小油田，此外德人還會提煉。種代用油，這種提煉廠數目亦不在少。總之，以德國而言，（包括奧地利，捷克，及波蘭西部在內，）一九四一年的國內油產大的在四百萬噸之譜。這數目在德國人看來當然不能滿意，因爲即以承平之時而論，德國每年消耗已需六百萬噸，至於大德意志，義大利和其他被佔領各國合起來講，那末每年消耗就須二千萬噸。德國以自己的一些油產和可從外國獲得的輸入，除了供給戰塲上鉅額的陸軍和空軍消耗外，又須顧到國內日常的用途，同盟國義大利—義國自己並無油產—以及其他被佔領各國。</p>
<p>因之，德國對於油的問題，須視外國方面究能供給多少來解決。羅馬尼亞的油田每年可產原油六百萬噸，現在羅國巳在德軍統制之下，對於油的問題，自可不再打算。自從德蘇簽訂互不侵犯條的後，大家都以爲德國就可從蘇俄獲得大量煤油了。其實蘇俄產量雖居世界第二位，然其國內工業和農產方面，自從十年以來竭力開發後，油的消耗非常之鉅。除了運輸問題暫且不談外，蘇俄如果要把煤油運往國外，而不影響國內的經濟情狀，那是件不可能之事。一九三九年蘇俄輸出的油祇有五十萬噸，照目下的情形看起來，無論受何威脅，蘇俄可以放棄一切，而決不肯把高加索的油田供手讓於別人。</p>
<p>德方所覬覦的巴庫油田，和伊拉克北部及波斯灣等處的油產，遲早總要奪取的。目下只有羅馬尼亞在掌握之中，惟羅馬尼亞每年所產六百萬噸，在運輸上却沒有方法可以運到德國，因爲運油一事和別種運輸不同，不像木材或煤斤等，可以從任何船隻火車裝運，或在任何地方堆置。運油一定要用特製的船舶或火車，在輪埠及車站必先有油櫃車及油管等設備，即在中途亦須有倉庫及油櫃車以便隨時轉運。德國和羅馬尼亞的運輸綫爲多瑙河和由東徂西的兩三條鐵路。</p>
<p>從各方面看起來，德國能從羅馬尼亞取得的油，今年大約祇有二百萬噸。即使從國內提油廠仍能照常工作和其他若干小來源一起包括在內，德國也只能弄到六百萬噸，去供應平時每年須消耗二千萬噸用途的各國。德軍在各戰塲作戰所需的尙不計算在內呢。</p>

<p>昨日油餅雜糧市面、仍不脫米市之牽制、故豆油晨盤承上呈之趨勢、續升三四元、計開大連油百餘桶、價爲一百七十六元五角至一百七十七元、大有廠油一百擔、價爲一百二十七元、苞米上午亦挺升一元左右、至午後回落半元外、共成交現貨一千餘包、期貨五十噸、黃豆因無特殊刺激、發奮乏神、因之心思交易遠疏、故在到存兩接實銷平淡之情形下、行情頻跌、昨祗由本街及榨油廠辦去天津豆三百餘包、價爲四十八元五角、歸德豆一千三四百包、價爲四十六元至四十五元一角、豆餅波濤頗多起伏、大局先大後小、仍處投機操縱之淫威掌中、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有五百六十五包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙波動已小</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、仍無變更，英美匯暗市波動已轉小、乃金價業已轉入盤境也、晨開後華商投機家力塞、而英美商行吸胃甚佳、市有回緊之象、後經華行金城浙興售出、供求勢平衡、終英金三辦士二八一二五、微長〇一五六二五、美匯平、仍五元三四三七五、半日交易平淡、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>供求漸見辜衡</p>
<p>自晨外電、印銀略長、大條與美銀皆平、各國匯兌美對滬小五分、餘平、中央掛牌各匯未更、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英匯三辦士二六五六二五、美金平、仍五元三四三七五、投機家首來塞出下月美金五元三七五、麥加利大通先後吸進、市勢欲鬆又阻、匯豐掛牌各匯未更、白銀平衡稅仍徵百分之二四·五〇後、華行浙興與金城先後售予某掮客又有利五月美金五元三七五、後有一部份投機家獲利着手補進本月五元三四三七五未獲、午刻金價升近六千五百元、曾軟至僅結五元三一二五、旋即回平、正午收市、英匯期現貨均三辦士二八一二五、美金五元三四三七五、比前日晚收、英長〇一五六二五、美平</p>
<p>香港申匯獨升</p>
<p>香港十日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、英美日各匯俱無變動、申匯現貨獨升五角、爲四百五十五元五角、（昨收爲四百五十五元）、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英美放長</p>
<p>天津十日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤平定、倫敦電匯鬆〇三一二五、爲三便士三四三七五、紐的電匯長〇六二五、爲五元四二七五、申匯及「聯鈔」暗盤均站原盤、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>經濟談　馮柳圣　銀行週報</h3>
<p>中　國第一種談經濟文字的定期刋物，為銀行週報。前乎銀行週報的雖有雜誌發行，亦偶或看見談經濟文字，但是偏重於政治中學文藝，而此則全以經濟文字爲主體，不及其它。</p>
<p>銀行週報之成立，得力於張公權；時張公權爲上海中國銀行副經理。在當時充滿舊勢力之上海銀行界中，張公權卓然爲新智識派之領袖。會民國六年的夏天，張公權邀宴諸靑來，徐寄廎，范季美，徐永祚，至其寓中；時張之寓所，似乎在老靶子路相近的一座洋房中，經此一席話，而銀行週報不久就呱呱誕世。</p>
<p>張自任總編輯，而以諸靑來，徐永祚爲編輯，徐寄廎，范季美則分任社務的一部分。爲了張自任總編輯，故其時的銀行週報，頗多張之文字。並在漢口路中國銀行內關一室辦公；至於今之香港路五十九號的社址，乃自銀行公會新厦落成後遷入。</p>
<p>後來梁啟超出任財政部長，即調升張公權爲中國銀行副總裁，到了北京，遂以徐永祚爲總編輯，而由徐滄水担任日本通訊，楊端六担任倫敦通信，陳淸華担任紐的通信，並由潘士浩，朱義農，馮子明，徐裕孫，劉仲廉諸人，分任編纂。人才濟濟。故銀行週報的聲譽日上。　（未完）</p>
<h3>金市徘徊</h3>
<p>昨日金市赤烚暗市、轉呈迂週局勢、先跌後漲、曾升近六千五百元關邊、各方人心由疲轉露不定、乃美匯經英美商行吸收鬆勢受阻、五元三七五未易穿出、故證券號與銀號幫於晨開後力售、抑退至六千四百三十五元、不久即來與錢莊幫爭進、空方獲利着手補進、反動步見上升、午刻達六千四百九十五元、終反跌軋升二元、收後金證兩幫突來賣出、又降至六千四百五十元、半日交易共五萬兩左右、下午週六無市、塲外價已趨穩、現金價反軋小、先由德孚出中興一百兩、價照期交高二百四十元、繼之續售二百兩、熾人出一百兩、福康永出八十兩、均高二百三十元、由成記買進、比上日的小二十元、飾金關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌勢鐵定</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、承上日收後疲勢、九點十五分開市即低三十五元、爲六千四百五十元、後起落甚速、由同康永·順源力售、故抬至六千四百七十元、復退至六千四百四十八元、大豐，成記。德孚買進、頓見抬上至六千四百七十五元、爲益大·同康永·恒記·力售、散戶猛撳、九點五十分遜至六千四百三十五元、爲大豐·新豐永·德成·義豐·順源·德孚·見賤力進所提上、外滙亦由鬆轉軟、散空爭先急補、價大漲小回、於午刻升至六千四百九十五元、天元力售、退至六千四百七十五元、浮空再進、正午收市六千四百八十七元、比上日軋升二元、照五月美金五元三四三七五結價、爲六千五百十七元、計撳卅元、收市後德孚·成記·公大·合盛售出、跌至六千四百五十五元、益大進至六千四百六十五元、最後金號證券兩幫仍售、爲六千四百五十元、半日有六十元高低、下午塲外六千四白五十元有賣戶、金號本牌金售價比蛤赤期交價高二百五十元、收淮比售出低七十元、現標金仍無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金兌價不動</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍掛六百九十五元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣漸平定</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價明平暗跌、故英美金鎊亦小一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票漸趨穩定、卒吿下落四分、收盤價爲十八元四角四分、香港要繼續趨疲、日金票供求尙衡、晚市仍站二元零七分原盤、朝鮮票供給旺盛、市價疲落、晚市退爲一元七角七分，</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷狹日紗廉　雙馬暫難抬頭</h3>
<p>上日慘落之紗市、昨行稍形站定、此因兩日來在瀉百元之巨、當然有立定可能性、然實際地位、暫無上升能力、因銷路缺乏、二十支雜牌紗價格旣低、走勢愈滯、同時存貨充足、雙馬一鬆、更無買主接受、且日紗售價允廉也、所以就此而論、棉紗本身上暫難抬頭、不過有一部份經濟充裕之多頭、購進之額量、依然勿動、因之市面尙能支持一時、然一般浮多已落荒而走了、至於買方議論、目前國際風雲日急、外匯步長、標金下落、邇來百物一致下降、棉紗航運阻梗、對於多頭大都放棄矣、如斯一來、下檔行情恐見一千四百元不足爲奇也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百八十六元、低價爲一千四百七十元、午後因週末暗盤乏市、有人說做過一千四百七十三元云、明日有紗一千一百五十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因上日午後收盤稍昂、人氣略定、首盤價爲一千四百八十五元、但此盤一開、買者殊稀、因上日大跌之後、一般多頭已屬精疲力盡、無力掙扎、所以市塲上之氣勢、已成散漫之象、旋後標金開出平平、檯面賣多　少、情况轉趨下弱、跌至一千四百七十七元、但多方某某復來拉幾包、又復回好至一千四百八十一元、此後在一千四百七十八九元、廻旋甚久、嗣以標金微昂、漲至一千四百八十六元、迨至收盤又回疲至一千四百七十一元、查半日問成交統計九千七百七十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港二二〇　同行九、五〇〇統計九、七二〇</p>
<h3>棉紗市塲跌跌漲漲　投機分子哭哭笑笑　四月份棉紗狂漲橫跌之索隱</h3>
<p>（一）在四月十五日春假以前、二十支雙馬價爲一千四百三十元、此時證券幫及某幫看小、因雙馬存貨充斥、廠方爲求减輕存貨起見、獎勵出口、每包紗如果確裝運外埠、廠方願貼一百元、如此一來，「重賞之下必有勇夫」、廣幫購進一批、即運香港寄堆棧中、調查下來、絡續買去的六七千包之巨、上海存貨當然减少、然外埠現貨則利厚、</p>
<p>（二）投機的人們、借題發揮、大爲活動、在市宜傳、存貨减少、籌碼乾枯、工部局爲電氣節的問題、廠家勢逼减工、市面要看飛漲至一千六七百元、又說百物大昂唯有棉紗不貴、於此掀起買風、一時進多出少、籌碼不易應付、市盤軋　、逐步上漲、至五月五日爲一千五百八十六元、情况看好、當然做多、吸收爲夥、</p>
<p>（三）豈料雙馬紗在此在抬濫拖之下、被迫趨高、然價格一大、基礎反不能健全矣、何以見得、揆其原故、雙馬雖以裝運抽出一部份、然雜牌紗各廠之貨、堆積如山、且浙東軍事發生以來、運輸阻梗、銷路大打折扣、所以標準紗一味向前跑、但雜牌紗猶似木驢、趕追蹩斷脚、造成市價之距離愈趨愈遠、與雙馬廉宜二百二三十元相等之念支紗、懸殊之程度大可驚人也、以上之情形、足使雙馬受致命傷、</p>
<p>（四）市面旣高、又見樹大招風之險、一遇風浪、波濤碎湃、且大家在多頭地步反動更劇、有一部份投機的人們非多即空、手段比較靈敏、豈料謠諑紛紛、謂太平洋風雲緊急、香港運貨不通、加之外滙暴長、標金下瀉、惡劣消息頻傳、致多頭心意動搖、大量的出籠、數萬包籌碼、經此一個翻身，市盤當然支持不了、結果苦了一般小投機的人們、往往偷鷄不着蝕把米、</p>
<p>（五）又有人說、邇來看了商業新聞、無物不在下流中、又云昔日四二支　價飛騰、昨今已慘落一二百元、三二支價目旣跌、而乏銷塲、日紗念支尤廉、總總說素、一度又利於空頭、不過目下物價高昂、廠家成本提增、前途起伏關鍵、仍依消費之多寡、較爲妥帖、吾則專靠張三進、李四出、種種之做作、脚地不能鞏固、多數心理回落程度、或可到一千四百元邊口吧、本年之棉紗市塲屬於拉鋸戰、所以投機人們、有一部份雖能勝利、然其餘依舊愁眉不展、開消不能照排頭、何苦何苦、而大都必的生司、最好是小公司盤剝剩餘利益、滿載而歸、快哉快哉、（景）</p>
<h3>棉市冷靜</h3>
<p>現　棉情况、冷寂如恒、所以交易完全屬於停頓狀態中、市面受紗市在落打擊、廠需束手矣、</p>
<p>火機草包一九四　協新一三〇包棧交</p>
<p>另　訊、滬埠外棉交易、因紗市趨疲、外匯放長、及國際情勢搖曳小定之影響、各方乃取觀望之態、廠方旣無納胃、同行亦未干採購也、但棉市略與紗市不同、蓋美棉漲勢頗高、同時滬埠存底不多、故情勢如有好轉、棉市仍有堅實之希望也、</p>
<p>紐　約棉市、因華盛頓政治消息利於多頭、及棉布貿易情形良好、各方人心興奮、大衆購意熱烈、市况因之一再活躍堅挺、昨日收盤價格、較之上日的高漲二十五六磅音、</p>
<p>又電、去年八月一日起至今年五月九日止、美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>上市累計　一〇、六六八、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>廠用累計　八、〇五一、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>出口累計　九一〇、〇〇〇包</p>

<p>至中國　六〇、二〇〇包</p>
<p>至英國　　五六、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>至德國　一三九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>各港市存　六、〇九三、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>印　度棉市較平、收盤價格榮辱互見、漲跌一二羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况、因美棉漲勢猛烈、故看高叫羅比餘、</p>
<p>又印棉經港轉運來滬、怡和洋行富陞輪、由香港裝來印度棉花三千九百二十一件、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>證券　內債似鐵轉堅</h3>
<p>—兩家洋行派股息—</p>
<p>公　債暗盤、昨日市况稍見轉佳、市塲謠言又有和平消息、此種讕言、不値識者一笑、市價大都一般散戶買進、抬高二三角、甲種依然未有做開、人心依然不能振作、局部散戶做多、殊未能影響整個市面、昨爲週六、祇做上午一盤交易、同康順昌略有買進、仍以各散戶五千一萬買進爲多、聯和鴻大均有吐出、丙種會抬高四角、入後仍屬拉抬不起、結果除甲種未能做開不計外、餘均略好二三角、成交的計五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股　票交易、成交中一信託公司股一百股、價爲十五元二角半、</p>
<p>英　商上海企業有限公司定於五月二十六日開派一九四一年份中期股息每股國幣一元二角五分、又悉該公司經董事會議決、宣吿自行淸算將於最近期間召開股東臨時大會、討論淸算事宜、</p>
<p>英商匯通洋行經理之克羅華橡樹有限公司定於六月三日召開第三十一次常年股東大會、該公司一九四〇年純合計達國幣九十一萬餘元、除已派中期息每股國幣二角五分外、擬派末次息一角五分、全年共派國幣四角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布虛怯　情勢未减</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市續疲、乃因人氣虛怯、各方傾向觀望、買户更形缺乏、散户斬出小額貨、成交價續見低落、惟廠盤不鬆、大市尙形穩定、結果白貨細布跌二角半、粗布斜紋跌一角至二角半、漂染布跌三五角、本街成交各布二百餘件、浙閩幫辦色布·色斜·粗布等一百餘件、夸港南洋幫辦色布·色斜·漂布·斜紋等二百餘件、十一日疋頭一千四百九十五件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　現貨市塲仍停業、故無正式市盤、惟龍頭細布暗盤、一說先做四十九元七角半、嗣後因取引所標準續軟、降至四十九元四角、亦禾成交、四君子嗶嘰喊售每碼一元五角五分半、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白微鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚軒輊、僅三五角之出入、公會劃盤、現貨二四組白外棧老貨一百十四元、五月二十日期粗初爲一百十五元四角·八角·五角·三角、後稍緊爲一百十五元六角·八角·九角·七角·八角、小四角、五月底期亦已開始交易、開盤僅一百十四元七角、旋升至十五元八角·七角·九角·八角半、更至十六元、荷赤八十八元至八十八元半、小五角、太古車白B嘜東棧一百十六元二角至十六元、西棧一百十六元半、DY嘜東棧一百零五元·五元半·六元、HX嘜一百零三元半至三元二角、又糖今有一萬包運往天津、</p>
<h3>煤炭　淮南煤来源廣</h3>
<p>淮南烟煤、近以來源甚廣、銷塲呆滯、煤多石質、以致不爲用戶所喜、祇能摻和高貨合用、故行情漲後回跌、昨開同業行拆、淮南統煤每噸三百十元、篩塊三百三十元、煤屑二百九十元、棧房自車、行槓外加、</p>
<h3>五金　交易淸淡</h3>
<p>邇來五金市面、因受鐵品禁止出口影響、客幫生意不動、致淸閒異常、雖本埠採辦依然未停、然交易零星、故而市氣失常、人心亦疲、各貨開價盤旋、茲略述諸貨之趨勢列左、</p>
<p>新盤元　盤元亦稱元絲、爲製造本釘之原料、然其他用途如建築幫螺釘廠等、亦有所搜、惟因其開價昂貴、則交易頗覺不熱、就中躉批買賣尤少、蓋本街製釘廠因目覩出產品銷路不暢、行盤軟弱、故對於原料之採辦、不敢大量、致成交零星、標準行情、昨每擔沽二百三十元左右、</p>
<p>本元釘　本廠元釘交易、因外埠客商進意不濃、致出口貨異常稀少、且本埠囤戶幫時有出籠、致流通貨過多、市塲供過於求、標準遂吿下挫、較之新盤元價殊感懸殊、昨每桶倍司價僅沽一百八十五元耳、</p>

<h3>竇納暢游內地歸滬　讚中國進步迅捷　發展各種運輸簡便奏效　陪都廣建新厦空防完善</h3>
<p>醫藥府適當各種工業莫不開發</p>
<p>中華基督教靑年會全國協會竇納氏、在內地游歷四月甫畢、頃抵上海、前（九日）向記者談稱、內地運輸、簡便奏效、連絡自由中國、成一堅强團結之國家、渠對此印象良深、運輸工具、方式繁多、如担夫·馬馱·獨輪車·手挽車·馬達卡取與飛機皆是、運輸當局決計發展運輸系統、而各官員莫不堅抱賡續奮鬥之決心、</p>
<p>重慶防空設備完善</p>
<p>關於重慶、竇氏聲稱、該地空防、世無其　、　其是防空壕、設備完善、頗多通水電舖木板者、宣傳委員會之防空壕、設備尤佳、從在空襲進行時、亦能照常廣播、陪都雖受重大損害、但許多暫時與恒久的屋宇、巳在建造中、如新生活中心區、其中屋宇業已落成或迅將竣工者、亦已重建、有傷兵翳院·療養院·餐室·及戶外大講堂等、</p>
<p>靑年會已　重建新厦</p>
<p>重慶靑年會主厦已被摧毀、宿舍受損則已修竣，靑年會近已募得十萬元、興建新厦、蔣委員長夫婦慨捐萬元、並函賀靑年會在陪都進行之良好工作、靑年會除募得十萬元外、復以十二萬元之代價售去舊厦、共得二十二萬元、在重慶鳩工重建新厦、靑年會在市郊設有協助鄕民之機關、其防空壕可容三千人、藉竹管調節空氣、</p>
<p>西南西北　足跡殆遍</p>
<p>竇氏又稱、渠從靑島啟程至開封、乘手推車過沙地而至屢易地點之黃河渡頭、旋在鄭州駐足、至洛陽搭火車抵潼關、於彌天風沙中、步行過關、復乘火車經西安而抵終站寳雞、轉附郵政卡車、經成都歷二十四小時而至重慶、復飛昆明、然後搭卡車至貴陽與桂林間途半、換登火車、復取道湖南·江西·與廣東、終抵香港、</p>
<p>地方工業　迅速發展</p>
<p>竇氏對中政府應付醫藥需要、尤表欽佩、更讚楊防疫局與中國紅會之工作、據稱、該兩機關協助實騐所製造苗漿及他種醫藥品、經營此等實騐所者、乃美國各醫學校之留學生、內地對國產品之利用日廣、地方工業如開鑛溶煉、均有迅速發展、電氣設備、四十至五十匹馬力之馬達及無綫電機等、皆能自製、因戰專關係、民衆大舉遷移內地、如長沙·南昌與廣州三處靑年會、被迫遷往新址、不足兩年、已立定根基、會員皆達二三千人、</p>

<h3>港米定今日到埠　民食已有保障　法公董局着手貢米登記　決定售價不超出一百元</h3>
<p>泰晤士報云、法公董局前日與米商開會討論時、曾議决由米商組織一委員會、由米商商榷、而由該局統制之、該局發言人前日宣稱、將立卽運購之第一批西貢米價、決不超出每石一百元之數、本星期四晚討論時、米商會向法租界當局表示、彼等決澈底與當局合作、據當局之意、凡欲購買是項米糧者、可向該委員會登記、再由該會將是項定單、轉交於法公董局、俾便向安南購　、將來並山該委會負責在法當局指揮下、將米糧分配於各地段、此　計劃、與公共租界完全相同、至於第一批港米、雖將以一百十元之價發售、但隨後運到港米之數、諒將較此　低、</p>
<p>米蠹昨日　最後挣扎</p>
<p>連日米價暴跌達　十餘元之鉅、惟一般米蠹、猶仍力匮最後之掙扎、致米價於大跌後、昨日又被稍形抬高、昨日米市開做後、大囤戶以聞悉港米今日確可到滬、非持價格勢將繼續下跌、且所囤積之巨額米糧、亦無法出籠、遂製造無稽謠言、以混亂市塲聽聞、致各檔米價、被抬高數元、其後得悉港政府所採食米統制辦法、係杜絕囤積居奇、對上海方面所訂購之食米、照常供給、故米價於後市又回跌、終被非法抬高三四元、</p>
<p>下午交易　尙在活動</p>
<p>雜糧業公會之下午交去年十月間、由該會監察會議提議、經米糧評價委員會議決取締後、但不久故態復萌、又吿復活、囚現下之米市交易、悉爲投機份子所操縱、乃將交易時問加長、俾若輩多一活動機會、致昨晨米價、被此種下午交易所抬高、故各方甚望駐塲探員與公會負責者、應從速明查暗察、嚴予取締、以穩定米市、</p>
<p>首批港米　今日抵埠</p>
<p>公共租界工部局所採購之首批港米五千噸、因天氣關係、須延至今日抵滬、最先承載者爲英商太古輪船公司之漢陽輪與英商怡和公司之明生輪、承辦發售是項港米之立基洋行、昨日已進行各項上棧及批購手續、至承銷米行雜糧行及米號、因今日係星期日、大致明日起開始提貨發售、</p>

<h3>蘇州河舢板百餘艘　昨遭日方鑿沉　七百餘人立時流離失所　若干較大船隻沒收自用</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、麥根路一帶蘇州河中、向泊舢板小船頗夥，密集成行、船戶水上爲家、生活貧苦、乃今（十日）晨忽有日海軍陸戰隊多名、前往該地、盡驅船戶約七百人於岸、然後鑿船使沉、船戶冒雨呆立岸上、目覩其船隻連同雜物、盡沉河底、</p>
<p>日兵被剌　引起糾紛</p>
<p>事緣前兩週來、該區曾有日哨兵遭槍擊、日軍乃會同水巡捕房警昌搜查麥根路旁小船、以期緝捕兇手、聞當時有嫌疑犯兩人被捕、日兵搜查旣畢、不分皂白、竟將小船一一鑿沉、查星期一夜、駐守該區某麵包廠前之日哨兵兩名、曾遭行刺、兇手係從蘇州河中舢板船中開槍、旋圖登岸、逸入公共租界被捕獲、</p>
<p>船底鑿洞　任令沉沒</p>
<p>日兵今晨所施破壞方法頗簡單、即將惶然不知所措之船戶、盡驅上岸、在船搜查一過、鑿洞於船底、仟水浸入沉沒是、船戶無奈、相率取船上蘆蓆、沿岸蓋棚、以避風雨、記奢抵該地探訪所覩情景、慘悽已極、時船戶方就地煮中飯、船上雜物、有經携出者、零亂散置於地、尙有若干船戶、涉足沒膝之泥水中、檢取下沉船隻上之應用物件、</p>
<p>較大船舶　已被沒收</p>
<p>日兵此舉、旨在肅淸蘇州河中小船、以防該區日哨兵復被人藏身舟中、發槍狙擊、鑿沉船隻共百餘艘、聞若干較大船舶、則被日兵沒收、以供己用、當時岸上旁觀者甚多、美陸戰隊與公共租界巡捕到塲驅散閒人、未幾、美兵離去、留西捕在塲維持、</p>
<p>封鎖後之　嚴重步驟</p>
<p>日當局對此沉船事、今日未有言論發表、衆意此乃日方自去歲十一月二十六日至十二月十八日封鎖愚園路以來所取最嚴重之步驟、聞公共租界警務處亦有肅淸麥根路一帶船隻不許其久泊之意、又傳星期一日哨兵遭槍擊後、該處船戶曾有千餘人被押赴日軍司令盤問、</p>

<h3>舟山被扣航輪　已有七艘</h3>
<p>浙東戰事未發生前、航行滬浙間而遭日艦扣留在舟山洋面之外輪、迄今數月、仍未釋放、昨據航業界悉、在舟山被扣之航輪、目前已增至七艘之多、緣數月前先後由浙省各口岸駛來上海而遇扣之航輪、為謀福·常德·江蘇·安曼利·及阿維瑪里等五輪、此次增至七艘、其餘兩艘當係新近駛往該處者、惟該兩艘之船名、尙無從得悉、衆料恐係留怕甌江碼頭之葡商民和及英商大通兩輪、蓋兩輪當戰事發生、猶未啟椗、或係事後不得已而駛往該處者、至各輪雖經各輪公司呈請領署當避交涉釋放、但日方迄無答覆、致呈停頓狀態、溫州方面、甌海　雖已正式恢複辦公、滬溫航運暫時無法恢復、順利輪開航滬甬綫一節、純係投機營業、殊不可靠、現聞中華華中及東亞三公司對滬甬綫、正在爭奪中、又悉中意公司之德平輪（即前行駛滬甬錢者）、最近由日商山下汽船公司承租、不下用意何在、</p>
<h3>西報論日報見解　對華認識不足　日如欲在華繼續駐軍　卽不能解除摩擦原因</h3>
<p>半官性質之「日本泰晤士」及「廣知報」、九日於所撰社評中、力主向中國求和、本埠英文大美晚報、昨日曾加以評論云、日本人殆爲世界上「最偉大之美術家」、昨就「日本泰晤士及廣知報」所發表之霄論、則知彼輩之貢獻、又已創一新紀紀　、</p>
<p>日本對華　認識不足</p>
<p>當該報泛論中日戰爭時、據稱、日本不能以武力征服中國、並力主以和平方式解決事變、但該報所建議之唯一停戰辦法、爲能允許日本繼續在華駐軍、吾人認爲此一方式能致力和平、則我人甚願於和平降臨後、供任何人免費用膳、今該報雖有正確之認識、惜乎未有正確之辦法、</p>
<p>不允撤兵　無法解決</p>
<p>該報稱、解決戰爭、有二途可循、一爲解除摩擦之原因、一爲確立足以保證有秩序生活之環境、惟事實上日軍之得繼續居留中國、適足以延長戰爭、增加摩擦耳、今求和者非中國、乃日本、蓋中國非至日軍全部撤退後、中國決不言和、</p>
<p>諱疾忌醫　遂致失敗</p>
<p>日本愈需要和平、惟有與重慶媾和之一途、而日人諱言之、此日本所以失敗而不能向其國內宣佈之事實也、四年來在華日軍之行動、斑斑可考、故現下日本、決不能使重慶方面、信任其撇軍諾言、以尊重中國之主權、</p>
<p>中國決心　繼續作戰</p>
<p>値此國際環境日趨好轉、足使中國能充分自信其有偉大將來之時、中國殆已不願進行任何和平談判、因四年間之長期戰爭、已顯示中國能自力更生、故目前日本美術家所繪製之和平浪潮、決不能使中國停止作戰、日本雖求和甚切、但和平決非日本在想所可促成、而提出和平條件之權利、因在中國而不在日本也、</p>

<p>西法洗染業全體洗燙工人三千餘名怠工風潮、在一再讓步下、勞方於前日上午起先行復工、勞資雙方於昨日下午進行初度談判、卒因勞方所提要求過多、一時未能調解成立、故定今日下午、作再度談判、大致經今日談判後、可望獲得圓滿解決、</p>
<p>密勒工人衝突</p>
<p>北京路一〇六號密勒汽車運輸公司全體司機及小工、於上月十九日、聯名向資方提出增加工資及生活津貼等要求、當經資方拒絕、勞方嗣於二十九日晨起、宣吿罷工、詎於本月六日、全體罷工工人、因公司當局另雇替工裝運英美烟公司貨件、當在韜朋路雙方　生毆　衝突、工人當塲有六名受傷、茲悉公共租界政治部、鑒於工潮僵持不解、恐再引起意外事端、故最近兩日內、派　竭力向雙方進行調解、大致在短期間即可望獲得圓滿解決、</p>

<h3>書市一瞥</h3>
<p>— 蔣萍</p>
<p>閒來無事，常喜歡住四馬路河南路一帶的書店去躣　，其始並不想姿買什麽書，看着書櫃上花花綠綠的各種書籍，心中似乎舒暢了些。正如我喜歡常往公園裏去蹓躂抱着　樣的心情。即使在一家書攤上發現了一本自己心愛的書，看看版權頁上的定價，再摸摸自己的口袋，不覺因寒傖而臉紅起來。百物急劇在漲，書價也隨着上升，雖然書攤邊立着不少翻書的人，而眞眞付了書款帶着書回轉的人確是很少；因此想到書商的營業，該是相當的悽慘罷！</p>
<p>米煤及一切物價隨着革命底五月，瘋在似地上漲，印刷界也　恐落　，跟着漲價，排工每千要三元七角，（如裝邊點和人名綫，還要另加），印工每令要十元出關，裝訂漲起百分之百廿；外加紙張等費，試問一本書的成本要多少？再加書店的房和電費職員薪津等開支和應賺的和息，恐怕薄薄一百面的　，以目前物價而論，即售兩元，還賺不得錢。餓死事大，飯不可不吃；精神食糧的書雖然重要，究竟還可將就，非必需時可以不買；因此，想　書商的命運，決非囤積米煤的奸商們所能想像釗的。</p>
<p>物力這樣的艱難，但是書舖裏五花八門的　書，　　不斷地在出來，什麽教程，什麽讀本，什麽文藝社，什麽出版社……依舊在大量製作，大量出版；我眞佩服他們的勇氣，同時又不能不懷疑這些書能會很暢地銷售。而且這些書的內容也都値得檢討的：思想純正立論精確的固然不少，粗造濫製，欺騙讀者的又何嘗沒有？還有許多內容幼稚空泛的定期刋物，我更不能不說他們簡直是浪費呀！</p>
<p>書舖裏還有一類書，近來似乎也很引人注目，便是從功利主義的美國販來了什麽怎樣做領袖，怎樣；訓練你自己，什麽處世教育之類後，吾國出版界便大量地傚尤製作，都儼然以老師的資格，指導靑年，教訓靑年，我眞驚異中國文人爲什麽喜歡這樣教訓靑年，好像靑年們非看這些書無以得救。我也懷疑中國靑年眞會這樣願意接受人家的「教訓」。我曾看到一個靑年寄給一位作者的信說：你說辦法就在你的身旁，只要你留心去找，不難找到的。但是我找來找去總是找不到，請問這辦法究竟在那裏？（大意如此，原句記不得了。）這話眞够幽默，可以代表一般靑年　過這些「教訓」的書籍後的感想。</p>
<p>翻譯方面有幾部書是値得一提的，便是傅東華譯的『飄』Gone　with　the　Wind（又名亂世佳人），林語堂的二部英文著作『生活的藝術』，『瞬息京華』（有譯作『京華烟雲』者），和　文『諷頌集』的譯本，都相　出版了。尤其是傳譯的『飄』，一下餘頁白萬字以上的兩鉅册，譯者雖聲明自譯畢「吉訶德先生傳』　不再譯書，終於又破戒而完成這部鉅製。我也不惜化了法幣　元買了這部『名著』。我買這部鉅著的動機，可分三點：（一）是去年美國的暢銷書，曾轟動各國的讀書界；（二）由這部鉅著改編攝製的影片，在上海人華戲院演映很久；（三）繙譯傅　華所譯；有這一個原因，所以忍痛地把它購得。但我至今還沒有把它看完，不知是因我不會看書，或者是描寫南北戰爭的故事使我懨倦？或者兩種原因都有。但我不否認這書引起我的惡劣印象：（一）白瑞德與郝思嘉小姐談吐間的下流形容詞；（二）美國某些地名，我國已有沿用已久的譯名，在本書裏却譯得怪聲怪腔，很是特別；我懷疑這書或不是傅東華所譯，抑或是別有原因，非識淺的我所知的。繼之，這譯文我不很喜歡它。</p>
<p>在　　『美國書店』裏，發現洋裝四鉅冊以前申報新聞函授學校全部講義的合訂本，問問售價要六十元。事後調查，原份全部講義其中失散很多，經添印補充而成完璧，但　共仍只有十部，可說是絕版書。這全部講義，本報原本想到保存，經一位同事，徵得館方同意，出資添印配齊得以流傳，該是很寳貴的一部新即學全集吧！</p>
<p>馬路書攤　書價也隨各物飛漲了，讀書界受到嚴重的打擊，書店裏只見許多翻書的人，而眞眞買書的顧客却十不得一。在這情形之下，馬路上的舊書攤，應運而生，確是經濟的書市塲，所以眞眞的書店顧客倒仕舊書攤上。　　（康祖藝攝）</p>

<h3>在窮困中成長的名人</h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>——只要有志氣，不怕出身低——</p>
<p>一個人，只要有志氣，肯努力，總有一天，會達到自己的目的、說不定，還會成為有名的人物，蜚聲仐球呢。世界上，有不少成名的人，他們的出身，是很低微的，從小就生活在窮困的環境裹。結果，在不斷的奮鬥中，建立了偉大的事業，或對人類有了偉大的貢獻！</p>
<p>以政治家說：美國前總統胡佛及現在首相墨索里尼，他們的父親，都是窮苦的鐵匠；蘇聯的領袖史太林，父親是鞋匠，德元首希特勒，小時，是個貧窮的孤兒，少年時，做過搬運垃圾的小工；我們的國父孫中山，捷克的前總統貝納斯，法國的大總統勒白倫，都是農家出身。以文學家說：英國的文豪蕭伯納，曾在倫敦當過抄貨單，記帳薄的商店小職員；蘇聯的「一代巨人」高爾基，曾做過裱畫店學徒，鞋店小夥計，園丁，廚司，買圣像，麵包的小販；挪威的小說家哈姆生，曾做過修路工人及電車司機。以企業家說：美國的煤油大王洛克斐勒當過小書記；汽車大王享利福特，十七歲時，曾進機械工廠做過學徒。其他像法國的名將霞飛，父親是個箍桶匠：美國的大發明愛迪生，十二歲做過鐵路小工，報販，廿一歲時，在紐約街頭，家連飯都沒有吃。但他們的成就怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們現在的環境，多數比那些名人幼時好，假使再不努力，不是很慚愧的嗎？所以一個人在世上，不怕窮不怕出身低，怕只怕自己沒有忍氣！</p>
<h3>做事要有「有始有終」的精神</h3>
<p>— 康</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們無　做一椿什麽事情，都應該立定宗旨，認定目標幹去，不要朝三暮四，三心兩意，結果是弄得一件事也不得成功，這真是最要不得的事。尤其是小朋友們是未來國家的棟樑，社會的柱石，這種習慣更是要不得，否則將來一定幹不出偉大的事業來。</p>
<p>昨天我讀了一本英文書籍，看到了一篇文章名叫「十個足跡」，這篇文章很可做我們的一個榜樣，所以我特地節譯下來寫在下面：</p>
<p>「某次有兩個印第安土人，一個名叫哈自達，是一個神奇的弓手，既強健有敏捷另外一個叫却通，是較弱的弓手，用的弓呢，也是很軟弱，但他很能刻苦忍耐，他們兩人一同出去打獵。</p>
<p>當他們經過一個小山的時候，看見地面上有一個小鹿新近走過的足跡，却通就要循着足跡去追這小鹿，但是，哈白達說：「你要追就去追吧！不過像我這樣強有力的狩獵家是要捉較大的獵物的。</p>
<p>於是，他們就分道大各找自己的獵物去了！</p>
<p>哈白達走了一個多小時，尋到了十雙大的麋鹿向着各個方向跑去的足跡，他就擇其中最大的一個足跡，循着去追，追了許多路，但是追不上，他就想去追另一隻了。</p>
<p>所以，他就回到他最初看見十個獸跡的地方，去循另外一隻麋鹿的足跡追趕而去，經過了一小時，仍舊捉不到，於是他又根擄另外一個足跡去追另一隻了，他說：「我一定要捉它來做食物」，然而，略追了一段路，他又放棄了，又去捉另外一隻他認為頗有捉到的希望的了，如是的，他費了一天的功夫，依着十個足跡一個個的找去，結果是一無所得。</p>
<p>可是，卻通他的見解卻較哈白達高，同時忍耐心也強，所以他緊緊跟着他當初所看見的那個小鹿的足跡追去，結果是把小鹿捉住了，</p>
<p>這個故事給我們的教訓是，做事要專心一致，有始有終，切不可三心二意，像道個哈白達一樣，結果是忙了一天，是一個野獸也捉不到，倒白費了寶貴的光陰。</p>
<p>小朋友們，這是值得的嗎？</p>
<h3>植物玩具</h3>
<p>— 牧童</p>
<p>――蠢豆做猴子――</p>
<p>小朋友，當你看了這個題目時，你一定要問我：「蠢豆只能吃，那能做猴子呢？」然而我並不說謊，他的確可以做猴子。下面我要將作法告訴你們，但是首先要請你們想一想，到底如何做法才好。也許你所想到的，要比我們所說的好得多。</p>
<p>現在，我假定你們　經想過了。我得把我的方法說出來，看是否與你們所想的一樣。做猴子的材料，除了四粒蠢豆以外，還有三根短竹篯和一根長竹篯；不過這蠢豆必須是新從園裹摘小來的。（為甚麽？）</p>
<p>先說猴子頭吧！將一粒蠢豆剝去上半粒的皮，留下下半粒的皮。當你剝開皮以後，你一定要發現一個小小的芽尖；呀，那不是猴子的鼻子嗎？於是你這時便可知道留下的皮有甚麽用處了。那正像猴子戴了帽子。</p>
<p>其次要說猴子的腰身，不過我們可以知道，腰身是簡單的，只要將一粒蠢豆代替便可以了。</p>
<p>在要說的是猴子的手和腳。我們不是還剩了兩粒蠢豆嗎？這就是辦法了。請你將蠢豆的皮剝去，再請你將每粒蠢豆去裹邊的一小部份，便不很像彎曲着的手和腳嗎？</p>
<p>猴子的各部份都做好了。我們只要用竹篯雨以蓮接猴子的頭部用腰身，一根小竹篯連接猴子的背和手，另一根小竹篯連接猴子的腰和腳。勝下的一根長竹篯沒有用；將它插在猴子的屁股上吧！這時候你便可以舉起猴子來玩了。</p>
<h3>科學和迷信</h3>
<p>— 陽春綠</p>
<p>從前人們知識幼稚，看到自然界的各種事物，都以為有神道主宰着，山有山神，水有水神，火有火神，風有風神，連年老的樹有樹神。後來經過了科學家詳細的觀察和精密的實騐以後，才把這種迷信打破。</p>
<p>夏天的雷電，是引起人們的懷疑，有人說：「是雷公菩薩出來了，是雷閃娘娘出現了。」又有人說：「是天上菩薩擎鼓。」直到十八世紀的時候，美國人富蘭克林用紙鳶來吸引空中的電，於是證明了空中的放電現象，這神秘的幕，才被揭破。</p>
<p>日蝕和月蝕的現象，在古代也很有許多假說，有的說：「給天狗吞掉了。」又有的說：「被野日頭和野月亮吃去了。」所以遇到日蝕或有月蝕的時候，常要做出許多無意識的舉動來，有人燒香叩頭，有人大羅敲鼓。自從科學家把天體運行的道理發見了以後，這種迷信也就破除了。</p>
<p>科學不是空虛的，是遇事用方法求真明的。所以迷信一經碰到了科學，便不攻自破了。但是一般愚蠢的人，還有迷信的呢。我們有科學頭腦的小朋友，對於一切新奇的事物，不可跟着一般人的迷信，認為有神有鬼，應當知道用精密的觀察和實騐，求得確切的知識。</p>
<h3>節省紙張的好方法</h3>
<p>— 堃</p>
<p>小朋友，在這百物昂貴的當兒，你們一定很願意在可能範圍內幫助你的爸媽節省的，這裹我告訴你們一個節省紙張的方法（不是同樣的節省金錢嗎？）：</p>
<p>你們一定有，而且很多的舊抄書，作文薄罷！好了，你們就可以把它們的訂錢拆去，把它一張張的反過來（本來正面成反面）,再把它們訂起來就成了。你們可以把它當拍紙薄或別的用處；你們可以用鉛筆或墨筆寫。此外，算數薄也可以利用它的空地方寫字。</p>
<p>這些，都是節省金錢的好方法；小朋友，你們不妨試試看，把你們做好的薄子，給你們的爸媽看，一定能夠得到他們讚賞的。</p>
<h3>兩條魚</h3>
<p>— 端芳</p>
<p>有一次，在一個小池塘裹，住着三條快樂的魚。其中有一條魚時時刻刻的運用着自己的智慧，另外一條魚在必要地時候也會臨機應變，而第三條則從來也不會動過腦筋。</p>
<p>一天，兩個漁夫走過池邊，他們看見清澈的水中有三條魚來來去去的游着。</p>
<p>「快點，讓我們去拿網來！」</p>
<p>第一條時時運用智慧的魚聽見漁夫的話趕快逃走了。</p>
<p>一會兒漁夫拿網回來了，先把池塘的出口處堵塞住，不讓剩下的兩條魚逃走，然後才把網放下水去。</p>
<p>這時第二條魚，開始驚慌起來，但是不久它就浮在水面裝得像死去一樣，漁夫們終於受騙了。</p>
<p>結果被捉去的是不用腦筋的魚，可憐在晚餐的時候漁夫們大大的吃了一頓。</p>
<p>後來漁夫對那條裝死的魚懷疑起來，幾個月後又遇着它，但是不再受它的欺骗了，所以结果也惨得很呢！</p>
<p>小朋友呀！你们是不是時時刻刻的在運用自己的智慧呀！</p>
<h3>萬物之靈</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>人是萬物之靈的一句話，老是在阿慧的腦海中打着轉，因為這句話時常打從上課的老師口中講述出來，而且他的父親有時候也對他這樣的說，可是他不十分明白爲什麽人是萬物之靈？其他的動物却沒有資格，這是什麽緣故呢？他把道問題去問他哥哥阿明。可是阿明也沒有確切的答覆。後來他等着了一個很好的機會，去問他的父親。「人是萬物之靈」的一句話，說來一些也不錯。而萬物是指天地間一切的動物和植物，人也是動物界的一種，可是人的聰明比了萬物要優越得多，換句話說，就是天地間一切的生物，誰也不及人的來的有靈性。所以人在自然界中的地位最高，不論他們要什麽，終能得到什麽。譬如他要捉鳥，於是他利用種種的方法來取得，如用槍擊，網捉等等聰明的方法來達到目的，這是其他動物所不及的。那爲什麽唯獨人有靈性？這因為人有思想，肯努力，能耐勞，願刻苦，而且人的頭腦是比了其他動物更來得發達，所以思想很靈敏，而獲得了萬物之靈的「實座」，至於思想是怎麼一回事呢？人腦上部蓋有一　蛋白的物質，內含神經生活細胞，厚約十分之一至四分之一英寸，這　蛋白物質便是管理思想的東西，如果　蛋白物質愈豐富，思想也愈發達。人的蛋白物質是生在腦的外唇，所以能夠生長發育，可使思想特別進步，而一般的動物的蛋白物質也有的，不過僅有薄薄的一唇，並且還生在腦的內部，便不容易生長發育，思想也就難於　敏了。思想是怎樣會發生的呢？如有一種消息，密佈人體全部的微神經便發生作用，循環經過於腦部的蛋白物質的神經細胞中，於是發生了思想，例如你的眼睛，注視在這一頁的這幾個字，於是這幾個字，便由你的眼神經迅速傳遞而達到你的腦中，同時循環經過腦的各部份的細胞中，而腦的各部份細胞更彼此交換傳遞關於這幾個字的消息。以後如果這幾個字的消息，又在那裹循環經過你的腦部細胞的時候，你便發生了這幾個字的思想，或為回憶，或更引伸這幾個字而連帶發生一些新的意義，神經傳遞消息的速度，通常大約為每秒鐘四百零四英尺，如手指被或灼痛，這個消息由指端傳到腦部，約需要一百二十五分之一秒。而其他動物每秒知能傳遞消息九十英尺。如一個人多思想也是要消耗少許能力，不過數量是極微的，還不及臂力消耗數量的百分之一，因為思想既要消耗能力，所以腦也需要食料是血液，故腦部有無數血管，血管內有很豐富的新鮮血液在繼續不斷的流着，來供給神經細胞的需要。阿慧父親滔滔不絕的這種講着，使阿慧恍然大悟起來。</p>

<h3>狄安娜竇萍　會放棄電影生活嗎？</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>現在全好萊塢人們都注視而且關心着狄安娜竇萍的前途，人們對她發半了許多不可避免的問題：便是她和馮保　結婚後是否要終止她的電影生活呢？或是她由於結婚而會獲得更大的成功呢？</p>
<p>不能否認的，狄安娜要算是世界上最幸福的女孩子了，她有着美麗的向貌，她有着聰敏的頭腦，並且具有天賦的余嗓子，使她更獲得了影壇上的名譽和地位。她是在一九三六年躍登影壇的，至今已主演了八部片子，如「小鳥依人」，「丹鳳朝陽」，「三朶花」，荳寇年華」，「初戀」及「春到人間」等，每部片子公映時，其賣座之盛，總是空前的，並且使人百看不厭。所以狄安娜也成爲環球公司的台柱明星，公司裏的預算表中，把狄安娜片子的收入也列在裏邊，八部片子的再三重映，使該公司賺了許多錢。狄安娜的這種在電影史上空前的叫座實在很少有的。所以公司裏也在短期內預備給她兩部最後的片子，一張是Nice　Dirl一張是Ready　forRomance；因爲公司裏也不能決定她在婚後會不會再上銀幕呀，所以何不現在給她多拍些片子，多掙些錢呢？</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍非常歡喜孩子，並且現在也在實習家事了，對於家庭的佈置，設計，等問題都十分注意；看來像是不預備再過電影生活了，不過据好萊塢一般的觀測，她至少在短時期中不會再拍戲，就是重上銀幕後也不預備改變作風。狄安娜扮一個妖冶的角色的話，是沒有人來欣賞她的演技的。</p>
<p>總之，還是要狄安娜自己答覆和看她以後賣座的情形而定的。</p>
<h3>方沛霖籌攝社會片</h3>
<p>鳴谷</p>
<p>提起「阿方哥」，大家該不會不知道，他就是現在導演「銀槍大盜」之國聯導演方沛霖。他初入影界，本是擔任佈景方面的工作，先後在中南，心明，大中華百合公司等服務，直到進藝華公司，在「女人」一片之佈景獲得輿論界的好評後，才一躍而爲導演，第一部完成「化身姑娘」。</p>
<p>戰後加人新華陣容，拍成「雷雨」「武則天」「雁門關」等片，聲譽甚佳，現在攝張慧冲牛演之「銀槍大盜」，以張慧冲在十年前「水上英雄」的聲勢，此番重返影壇，與影界人十相見，預料當可騷動一下影圈內外人士的。</p>
<p>昨日，記者遇方沛霖，談及「銀槍大盜」攝製情形，工作極爲緊張，現先拍張慧冲之戲女主角壟秋霞的戲，至今還未開拍，本月底，可將張慧冲之全部演出趕成，原因是張慧冲將於下月起開始在蘭心大戲院或大上海大戲院作魔術表演了</p>
<p>大槪在下月中旬「銀槍大盜」也許可以全部吿竣，此片完成，「阿力哥」談一部片預備拍社會片，際此時裝片抬頭聲中，他感到社會性質的影片是不能忽略過去的。社會片之劇本，已在趕寫中，片名已決定爲「百刦玫瑰」，純粹反映現社會，諷刺現社會，而採取與「黑天堂」影片同一的方針。</p>
<h3>血雨瓊苑</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第八章　落花有意隨流水</p>
<p>剛纔走回房去，月光甚明，織形畢露，忽見桑一淸穿着短衣，趿着睡鞋，從內室那邊躡足向他自己房裏走去，輕輕閉上了門，好似做賊一般，許靖心裏怎不明白？知道今天是十六，王永泰守戒，在外房睡宿，不進何姬房的，明明是姦夫淫婦乘隙歡會了。可笑何姬旣有伊的表弟和伊私通，却又抱着得隴望蜀之心，偏要來引誘自己。伊當作天下烏鴉一般黑，那知我許靖是個頂天立地的大丈夫，豈肯幹此禽獸之行呢？唉！是可忍也，孰不可忍也？我倒要乘間向王永泰進言勸他好好防備，把道厮趕了出去，方是道理。我旣然知道了這事，豈能始終學金人之緘口呢？想定了主意，也就回房安宸。次日他到衙中去，恰逢周遇吉在城外閱兵，且習野戰，他也跟着出城去隨衆操練，軍容甚盛，他見了，心中也暗暗歡喜。因爲那時候李自成已破潼關，風聲日緊，周遇吉下令城防格外嚴密，以防寇侵，所以有此閱兵。下午回去，剛全自己房中，見何姬身邊的一個侍婢在他房裏收拾桌上放着幾樣乾點心，見許靖回來，便交代許靖說，這是如夫人贈送與公子的。許靖只得道謝而受。侍婢收拾畢，也就退去。許靖暗想何姫遭自己嚴拒，却還不恨我而送我食物嗎？可是伊對我的心尙未盡冷，我更不可不防了。到晚上睡眠的時候，發見枕邊有一塊香　帕，上面繡着一對雙飛蛺蝶，香氣撲鼻，明明是何姬身邊之物，怎樣到了我的炕上來呢？想了日間代他收拾枕被的侍婢，一定是那侍婢拿來暗暗放在我枕下的。這事究竟有何用意呢？雖道何姬痴情不死，故意送我這羅帕，春蠶縛繭，仍想來誘惑我嗎？那麼我也難以安居在此了。　（六〇）</p>
<h3>寄給「工華」</h3>
<p>— 譚風</p>
<p>—寫在看過「雷雨」公演以後</p>
<p>我和你們並不認識，這回看過你們第五次實騐公演之後，却想和諸位說幾句話。</p>
<p>一般的並非全體）講來，演員沒有把握住個性：魯貴是一個陰險狡滑的小人，這點陳鐘君似乎表現得不够明顯。要不是看過劇本，在他的外形上也很難辨出是周公館裏的僕人。他的第一幕的臺詞背得不熟，爲了太熟的緣故，中間便缺少停頓，語氣也欠變化，叫觀衆直感到平淡枯燥。</p>
<p>周萍的扮像似嫌蒼老了一點，演他的人，馬區君，缺乏眞實的情感，尤其對於動作事先缺少思索。移步太機械。莊華君的侍萍，欠衰老，動作亦太快，讀詞有好些都沒吐得明晰，暢快，看見樸園的那景，該有多少可以做戲的機會，可是她却平平地唸過了。</p>
<p>樸園的衣衫過新，雪白的領子露在鐵靑的長杉外面，不是一個對於世事感到消沉的老年人應有的服裝。你瞧：他右手還掛着一串佛珠，可是有了它，害得以禮君的一隻手老是彎着，像一個受了傷的兵士將手掛在紗帶匕一樣，因此他的動作便有些呆板了。梅蓮的化裝顯得太年輕，當她和萍，冲站在一塊兒的時候，要楚說冲兒是她親生的孩子或者說萍兒比她史年輕那是沒人會信的。她演繫漪我們覺得的不是過火，倒是不够。她笑得不頂自然，可是在第四幕的開端她演得很好。</p>
<p>我眞替演四鳳的江泓覺得抱怨，雖然我還是初次看她演戲，然而我認爲她是懂得怎樣演的一個人。你們的效果配得很不錯，雷雨很逼眞。譬如傢具太新，太「摩登」不像是樸　嘴裏所說的「十八年前的老樣子」。窗帘與盆花都採用了鮮紅色，這也是足以影響到悲劇的氣氛的。我吹毛求疵地說了這麼些不應當說的話，目的祇是想與你們有個硏討的機會。可是，你們也「願意和我拉拉手麼？」</p>

<h3>Washington Maritime Commission Announces Increased US Shipping to China; Another 20 Ships to Sail Red Sea; Non-Belligerent Status Soon to Change</h3>
<p>Washington - The Maritime Commission announced yesterday that it will dispatch more ships to China, details undisclosed. It also added a new US shipping line to the Red Sea. United Press had previously learned that seven US ships had been designated to sail the Red Sea, and 20 more will be added soon. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US Maritime Commission stated yesterday that US-registered ships have begun operating in the Red Sea, and shipping to China will also increase. The Maritime Commission did not allow details regarding this matter to be released, stating that "we have adopted a strong policy of not publishing any news of ship movements, lest it be detrimental to Britain." (Reuters World News, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - A Tokyo newspaper's pronouncements, supposedly from official sources, that Japan may cease its war against China, do not arouse suspicion here, but neither are they readily believed. Japan has been at war with China for four years and has failed to make China submit. This has even led to disappointment within Japanese military circles. Officials here have long been aware of this situation. However, observers wonder how Japan, deeply mired in the quagmire of continued warfare without showing any sign of weakness, can extricate itself and avoid disaster. It is undoubtedly eager to redeploy a large part of its army in China, and a large number of merchant ships traveling to and from China to supply its army, elsewhere. Therefore, its talk of ending the war against China is probably just wishful thinking. At the same time, some say that Japan is making this statement to show how much it loves peace, so that the United States will not immediately implement aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act, because Japan knows that China is preparing to take the offensive once American cannons and airplanes arrive. Furthermore, Japan's statement is also related to recent developments in the United States. According to news from the East, Japan is deeply concerned about the tense relationship between the United States and the Axis powers in Europe, fearing that Germany will ask Japan to fulfill the alliance agreement of last September. Well-informed sources here believe that the United States will change its status as a non-belligerent in the short term, perhaps within weeks, and join Britain in resisting the Axis powers. If that happens, Japan, as one of the three Axis powers, will have no escape. People here are now watching the progress of the ceasefire talks with China with great interest, but the plan to aid China will continue to move forward. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated this morning that although Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently expressed Japan's desire for peace, American politicians continue to view Japan's actions as warlike. Japan cannot remain indifferent to the United States' aid-to-Britain plan, which includes the Indian Ocean within the patrol range of the US Navy. Also, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun stated today that if one wants to sweep away the forces of Britain and America in the Far East, one must first resolve the conflict in China. If Japan sits idly by and waits for the United States to complete its war preparations before opening fire, would that not be too negligent? (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<h3>Burmese Authorities Issue Notice Restricting Export of Valuables</h3>
<p>Rangoon - The authorities previously issued an order based on the Burmese Defense Ordinance, prohibiting the import of items made entirely or mostly of gold into British Burma, except with the permission of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in Rangoon. The Governor had previously allowed anyone to bring such items into British Burma with a total value of up to 500 rupees. The authorities have now issued an amended notice based on the Defense Ordinance, prohibiting the export of diamonds, items made entirely or mostly of gold or platinum, gems, semi-precious stones, and pearls to any place outside British India, except with the permission of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in Rangoon. The Governor has previously allowed anyone to export items made entirely or mostly of gold with a total value of no more than 500 rupees from British Burma. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Holds Military Parade Commemorating German Invasion of the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Batavia - The Dutch East Indies held a solemn military parade yesterday to commemorate the anniversary of the German invasion of the Netherlands. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Starkenborgh Stachouwer, reviewed the parade of armored vehicles, marines, and Red Cross units. Airplanes soared overhead, and officials laid wreaths at the memorial monument at night. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Batavia - Special prayers were held in churches here last night to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the German invasion of the Netherlands on May 10th. Native leaders sent representatives to wish the Queen of the Netherlands well. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan and Dutch East Indies Conclude Oil Agreement; Supply to Continue for Six Months; British Believe Japan May Postpone Southern Advance</h3>
<p>London - According to special sources, representatives from Japan and the Dutch East Indies have concluded an oil agreement. The Dutch East Indies will supply Japan with 925,000 tons of oil over the next six months. The Dutch representative was the Director of Economic Affairs, Mook, and the Japanese representative was Kensuke Horinouchi. This agreement includes a small amount of low-grade aviation gasoline, but no highly volatile gasoline. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>London - News from the Far East last night indicated an unexpected improvement in the situation in the Pacific. Japan and the Dutch East Indies have reached a new agreement under which the Dutch East Indies will supply Japan with another 925,000 tons of oil over the next six months. The significance of this agreement is that the Dutch East Indies will continue the oil supply arrangement established last November for another six months. Political figures say that they believe the agreement is a reassurance that Japan will no longer insist on the massive increase it had repeatedly hoped for, and also state that this fact may indicate that Tokyo wants to do its utmost to resolve the war in China and postpone its southern advance for the time being. Judging from the situation, we can see that Japan does not want to provoke conflict in the Pacific at this time. However, there is one fact of far-reaching significance, which is not revealed by British diplomatic sources: the Japan-Axis Pact of last September contained a secret clause stating that if the United States entered the war due to the provocation of Germany and Italy, Japan would not necessarily have to join the war to help the Axis powers. Diplomats believe that this secret provision is largely based on Japan's own decision as to who is the instigator. In other words, if Japan believes that going to war with the United States is detrimental to Japan, then Japan does not have to blame the United States when the situation predicted by the secret clause occurs. As early as last October, European diplomats learned of this secret clause, but it has only now been confirmed. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Kobe Shimbun recently reported that although negotiations are underway between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities towards Japan has not improved. Restrictions on the activities of Japanese residents in the territory are becoming increasingly strict. According to information received, foreigners who wish to enter the Minahasa province of West Celebes must first obtain permission from the military authorities in Manado. Although this measure is nominally intended to prevent foreign fifth columnists, it is actually aimed at Japanese residents. Not only that, but the Dutch East Indies authorities have also stipulated that Japanese sailors can only land at Manado port and are not allowed to land anywhere else. In addition, Japanese who land must pay a deposit of 150 Dutch guilders (approximately 240 Japanese yen). This measure will inevitably delay Japanese travelers, as Japanese citizens must request permission from their government to take more than 200 yen out of the country. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Opposes Escort</h3>
<p>Washington - There are differing opinions on whether President Roosevelt will order an escort without seeking the consent of Congress. Just at this moment, the request for the US Navy to escort supply ships was strongly opposed by the Senate yesterday. Senator McNary, the defeated Republican vice-presidential candidate (opponent of the Lend-Lease Act), stated that he opposed escort and continued that the President should submit the issue to Congress before implementing it. Senator George, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from Georgia, echoed his opinion, stating that if the President believes that escort is necessary, he should consult Congress. George said, "If the President recommends escort, I will examine the recommendation based on the facts. Personally, I do not support escort unless I also support going to war." Senator Walsh, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee from Massachusetts, also held the same view on the issue. (International News Service, 10th)</p>
<h3>US President Requests Funds to Build New Airfields; Total of 140 Sites Requires Over 60 Million Dollars</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to appropriate $66,477,750 to build 140 new military and civilian airfields and to expand 20 airfields currently under construction. It is reported that the main reason for this expansion is the increase in the number of both the Aviation Technical Corps and aviation schools under the Army training program. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>US and South American Officials Discuss Western Hemisphere Defense</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires - The Argentine Foreign Minister and the Secretary of the Navy held a secret meeting yesterday. Although the content is unknown to outsiders, well-informed sources indicate that the two discussed a report from Argentine Admiral Guisasola from New York. It is said that Guisasola discussed Western Hemisphere defense with US naval officials Stark and several South American admirals. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires - The newspaper Crítica published an interview with former Argentine President General Justo, in which he was asked whether Argentina should join the war if American solidarity were threatened by Germany. General Justo replied that this war is attacking all the principles on which Argentina was founded. It is reported that at the Pan-American Conference held in Havana, Cuba, it was said that anything that endangers the Americas would not be tolerated. The current state of preparedness is not based on mere speculation. We should be loyal to our American obligations. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Legal Tender Continues to Improve; Stabilization Fund to Actively Support</h3>
<p>London - Chinese legal tender continues to improve. People here believe that this is due to the resumption of business by the banks in Shanghai, and it is expected that the strengthened Stabilization Fund will soon be able to resume its active support, leading to short sellers rushing to cover their positions. London's Eastern bankers believe that the Stabilization Fund can technically work with one of the American banks in Hong Kong to perform its duties without waiting for the appointment of its American members, but it is expected that the Fund will not take hasty action. Today, the Japanese continue to monopolize the export industry, and the purchase of war materials has increased imports, so the trade balance is naturally unfavorable to Chinese legal tender. However, recently the currency has not been determined by trade. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Gifts Dress to Madame Chiang</h3>
<p>New York - Mrs. Roosevelt gifted Madame Chiang Kai-shek with a Chinese-style printed dress, which was a product of the China Relief Society. The President also purchased two dresses for his own use. In her letter to Madame Chiang, in addition to the dress, she also thanked Madame Chiang for the warm hospitality her son James received when he passed through Chongqing. The letter ended with greetings to Generalissimo Chiang and his wife. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Pan American Aircraft Flies to Singapore</h3>
<p>Manila - The first Pan American Airways flying boat from San Francisco to Singapore, the California Clipper, took off from Cavite at 5:25 this morning, scheduled to arrive in Singapore at 5:00 PM today. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Health Improves</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's stomach ailment continued to improve yesterday, but he cancelled Friday's regular press conference and plans to go to his Hyde Park estate at the end of the week. (United Press, 10th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>American Actions Nearing the Brink of War</h3>
<p>It is a universally acknowledged fact that the United States is increasingly nearing the brink of war. If the situation in the European war continues to evolve in its current form, or if the scene everyone is familiar with finally unfolds in the South Pacific, then it is expected that a head-on conflict between the United States and the aggressor nations will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Speaking solely of the European war, ever since President Roosevelt announced the expansion of the neutrality patrol zone at the end of last month, and explicitly stated that "if necessary in the future, American warships may sail into war zones," the issue of escort has become the focus of worldwide attention. Regarding this matter, not only have various bureaus in Washington repeatedly issued explicit statements, but there is no doubt that the US Navy itself is also undertaking the necessary preparations in reality. Moreover, at a time when the Senate is about to formally debate the escort bill, on the one hand, the House of Representatives has already passed the "bill to requisition Axis merchant ships," and on the other hand, the government authorities have arrested German and Italian expatriates. It is reported that the American authorities have begun to implement "lightning-style searches and arrests" of German and Italian journalists, sailors, and other suspicious individuals residing in the United States. These measures are sufficient to show that the relationship between the United States and the Axis powers has reached the stage of close combat, and at the same time, it can be seen that the American government and public opinion indeed have the determination to burn their boats and risk war.</p>
<p>Once the escort method is implemented, the natural consequence will be armed encroachment from the Axis countries, because the German authorities have repeatedly declared; "All ships that enter any war zone designated by Germany, including American warships, will be sunk by Germany." Therefore, if we do not talk about escort, it is fine, but if we talk about escort, we must consider the worst-case scenario in advance, that is, consider the possibility of participating in the war. Therefore, since President Roosevelt and other authorities in the United States have recently issued repeated warnings and speeches, hoping to awaken the American people's attention to and understanding of the current crisis. In short, officials in Washington want to make the entire country understand that if Britain is defeated, the United States and other countries on the American continent will not be able to escape the disaster of being invaded by the Axis powers. Therefore, instead of waiting for Britain to fail and then being forced to fight, it would be better to help Britain as much as possible at this time, so that it will not be defeated, so that it will win, to avoid or reduce the crisis of the United States being directly invaded. If getting involved in the war because of aiding Britain happens, the price will be lighter than fighting by itself in the future, because participating in the war today is a situation of British-American cooperation, while fighting in the future will become a dangerous moment of independent resistance.</p>
<p>Given that the American isolationists are still stubbornly obstructing, it is expected that the escort bill will have to go through a heated debate before it passes Congress, but if one reads through the "bombastic speeches" issued by several important American figures in recent days, it is not difficult for the world to imagine that the idea of American warships escorting, and even the idea of directly participating in the war, has already reached more than 50% maturity in American public opinion. Because if this were not the case, then Stimson and Knox, who are now the Secretaries of the Army and Navy, would not have been able to make such frank and bold remarks as they did recently.</p>
<p>In addition to publicly advocating the use of the navy to safely transport munitions to Britain across the ocean, Colonel Stimson also explained that if the United States wants to maintain its freedom and security, the entire ocean surrounding the Western Hemisphere must forever be under the jurisdiction of the United States itself or its allies. Otherwise, the United States will not be able to isolate itself from the aggressor nations' armies. Secretary of the Navy Knox, on the one hand, responded to Stimson's proposal, declaring that the Navy is prepared to carry out escort work, and on the other hand, he announced that all of America's resources, including the vast resources in finance, industry, trade, manpower, and production, will be used for a "supreme purpose," which is "to ensure that the British Navy in the Atlantic, which protects the American continent, is not destroyed by a nation that is openly hostile to the United States."</p>
<p>The expressions of the highest military and political authorities of the American government are like this. At the same time, the opinions of important figures in the opposition and general public opinion, with a few exceptions inevitable, are often more active and thorough than those of the government authorities. For example, Republican leader Willkie has repeatedly criticized the current patrol method as insufficient, and firmly advocated that escort is necessary. Vincent, the chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, shares the same sentiment. Senator Pepper from Florida is even more radical, advocating the coordinated occupation of the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde Islands, and the French West African port of Dakar with Britain, in order to pre-emptively strike. Regarding the Far East, he even demanded "sending fifty first-class airplanes to level Tokyo to the ground," which shows the intensity of his ability and degree.</p>
<p>These many remarks are enough to reflect the general psychology of the American nation today. If we add to this the partial mobilization of the American fleet, the unprecedented large-scale exercises of 1.4 million army troops, and the decision of aircraft factories across the country to rush to build 80,000 airplanes by 1943, it seems that the world can no longer have the slightest doubt about the future direction of the United States. The only thing we are concerned about and cannot help but say is that we hope the United States will remember the lessons of the past, thoroughly implement the principle of "seizing the initiative," and absolutely not wait until the democratic front is frustrated again or the aggressive front is arrogant again before implementing any assistance. It must be known that one hour of delay is equal to several tons of war materials sinking to the bottom of the sea, several British factories being bombed, or several strongholds on the front line being shaken. May the wise American nation, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, act decisively and swiftly seize the opportunity!</p>
<h3>54 Japanese Planes Again Attack Chongqing Yesterday in Separate Waves; 200 Bombs Dropped, Destroying Over 100 Houses; French Embassy and British Envoy's Residence Both Affected</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Fifty-four Japanese planes, in two waves of 27 each, invaded the city's airspace from Hubei, one after the other at 10:47 AM and 11:25 AM. After the anti-aircraft troops fired at them, they dropped over 200 bombs in the vicinity of the city and flew east. Over 100 houses were destroyed, and over a dozen people were killed or injured. Many bombs fell near the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, damaging part of the building. The vicinity of the French embassy was also bombed, affecting a portion. The American Methodist Episcopal Church's Qiu Jing Middle School was bombed again today. The residence of the American missionary Mr. Reppert, who has lived in Chongqing for over 30 years, is within the school and has been damaged, making it uninhabitable. (10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - At 11:00 AM today, 54 Japanese planes dropped 300 bombs on the western suburbs of this city and other areas. The former French Embassy was destroyed, and a building of an American church was also damaged. This was the third air raid by Japanese planes this year. The residents here had already received the air raid warning and took shelter in air raid shelters, so the casualties were only about 30 people. The Japanese planes attacked in four waves. A large hole was blown into Chengdu Road, but it was repaired within an hour after the air raid ended. The air raid shelter next to the reporters' apartment was hit by a heavy bomb (said to weigh 100 pounds), but fortunately no one was injured, only a white pig wandering outside the shelter was killed. The building that housed the French Embassy last year, which was also damaged yesterday, had its front destroyed today. The French side had abandoned the house after it was damaged last year. A bomb fell outside the Qiu Jing Middle School grounds, damaging the residence of American missionary Rappe. According to Mr. Rappe, the Japanese planes seemed to want to kill us, because five bombs also fell on our grounds yesterday, and my house was also damaged today. As a result of today's bombing, at least 20 huge stones fell on my lawn. After the Japanese planes dropped bombs yesterday, they scattered leaflets. The leaflet contained a photograph of Stalin and Molotov announcing the signing of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty, and mentioned Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's tour of Europe, and even Stalin and Matsuoka embracing and kissing at the station were depicted in the leaflet. The leaflet also described the reactions of various capitals to the Soviet-Japanese treaty, with the opening lines stating "The United States sees this treaty as a 'threat'," "Britain, to console itself, claimed that this treaty would not change the situation," and "Chongqing is angry." According to news reports, the reaction of various countries to the Soviet-Japanese treaty was published long ago. It is believed that the Japanese planes dropped these leaflets to show "The Soviet Union is now my (Japan's) ally, not your (China's) friend." (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The lower city and inner suburbs of Chongqing were again heavily bombed today. Two waves of Japanese planes attacked Chongqing before noon.

<h3>Britain Will Spare No Expense to Defend Egypt and Suez; Naval and Air Forces Continuously Patrol the Seas to Prevent Enemy Military Equipment from Being Smuggled into North Africa</h3>
<p>London - It has been learned recently that after the British Navy in the Eastern Mediterranean carried back the British troops retreating from Greece, it is now concentrating its efforts on preventing enemy troops and war equipment from being transported from Italy or Sicily to Tripoli and Benghazi. British destroyers and submarines, based in Malta, are constantly monitoring to prevent Italian ships from sneaking through. It is widely believed that Italian ships are taking advantage of French territorial waters. Sources in London said that even with the assistance and protection of the British Air Force, the British Navy cannot guarantee to completely block the smuggling of enemy supplies to Libya. The entire British position in the Mediterranean depends on the defense of Alexandria. Now that the enemy forces in North Africa have advanced eastward along the coast, and Greece and the Aegean Islands are also in enemy hands, Alexandria is vulnerable to enemy air raids. However, the range of enemy fighter planes is still insufficient to protect their dive bombers from attacking Alexandria. This is of crucial importance. The British must prevent enemy fighters from reaching Alexandria at any cost, otherwise the British fleet there will feel extremely insecure. The defenses of the Suez Canal are also being strengthened to keep the canal open. Islands such as Crete and Cyprus are also of great value to British defenses and must be held at all costs. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - Germany's blitzkrieg in the Balkans has naturally focused the attention and emotions of the world on that area, neglecting the importance of developments elsewhere. However, observers must pay close attention to Germany's renewed activities in Africa. From a strategic point of view, the Nazi's sudden appearance in Libya may be as important to the future of the Mediterranean as the war in Greece and Yugoslavia. Commentators have noted Germany's apparent pincer movement against Greece from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. If we broaden this focus, we can discern a larger and less obvious pincer movement with Egypt and the Suez area as its target. One arm of this pincer is Hitler's offensive in the Balkans, and the other is his offensive in Africa. British estimates place the current German forces in Libya at more than three or four divisions, in other words, from 30,000 to 60,000 men. However, general reports indicate that these German forces are supported by transport vehicles, tanks, armored vehicles, and other heavy equipment. Regardless of the exact situation of the Nazi strength there, it is clear that a large number of mechanized troops have been safely transported across the 300-mile Mediterranean route from Sicily to the African coast. The strength of these mechanized units is clearly sufficient to force the British to withdraw from Benghazi and not dare to fight there. And we must assume that the German generals would not dare to attack unless they were confident that they could maintain their supply line to Europe. Therefore, all indications are that the Axis can maintain traffic in that part of the Mediterranean. The British Navy is very superior in this area, so this traffic is clearly maintained by the Air Force. Under the protection of the Air Force, the Axis has transferred its armored units and continues to maintain its supplies from Europe. Some reports say that the German forces are merely sneaking past the British blockade, but the German forces are careful planners and would not undertake such a secret and uncertain transport with severed support. Moreover, the theory of smuggling cannot be established. Although the nearest neutral point on the coast of Africa from Sicily is only 300 miles, it still takes more than a day's journey to sneak across in the dark, and the route is very close to the British base in Malta, so it is often under British surveillance. Even from Sicily to neutral Tunisia, which is less than 150 miles, the journey still takes ten or seventeen hours, so it still cannot be crossed in a few hours at night. Therefore, it is more reasonable to say that the Nazi Air Force concentrated its planes to patrol the area so that Axis ships could travel back and forth under their protection more safely. The strategic importance of the battles fought by the Nazi Stuka bombers with the British forces in that area is greater than outsiders realize. This may be the reason why the German Air Force can establish patrols. If so, it can show that once the sky over a specific location is occupied, ships can move without being harassed by the enemy. After the British Navy's great victory over the Italian forces, many commentators said that the Mediterranean had become a British lake, but this optimism was greatly exaggerated, because the Axis is still using the Mediterranean to transport its armored units to Africa. Here we should recall again the important lesson of the Nazi invasion of Norway. At that time, the German forces were able to transport troops and war equipment across the Skagerrak under the strong British naval surveillance. Now, also under British naval surveillance, they are transporting troops and machinery across a waterway five times wider than the Skagerrak. The importance of this incident and the Norwegian incident is that the Air Force has changed the old war situation. Anywhere within the range of true air power, even who controls the sea surface is no longer a question. The question is who controls the airspace above the sea surface. The above question is particularly evident, even when the British fleet severely damaged the Italian forces in the Ionian Sea and elsewhere, the Axis was able to use the Mediterranean waterway. Even if the last Axis warship in the Mediterranean is sunk, the flow of German troops into Africa will not be blocked. If you want to block the entry of German troops into Africa, you must use the British Air Force to break through the Axis Air Force that maintains traffic in the Mediterranean. When the two sides decide the outcome in the Mediterranean sky, the Navy in the Mediterranean cannot exist. The Italian Navy will be defeated to the point of no return, and the British Navy must temporarily retreat until the victory or defeat in the air is decided. Although the situation in North Africa is not very obvious in the news, it has shown its military importance. The above points can give the United States a lesson. Since Germany can pass through the Mediterranean, why can't the United States pass through the Atlantic to transport American goods to Britain? Our problem in the Atlantic is not to maintain the waterway, but to maintain the spatial power so that commerce can flow freely as before. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Offers Assurance; Respects Portuguese Sovereignty; Portugal Strengthens Defenses of Atlantic Islands; Confident It Can Resist Any Aggression</h3>
<p>Lisbon - The war in the Atlantic has shifted attention to Portugal. Although the Portuguese government has not been overly alarmed by the recent developments in the international situation, it has now adopted ordinary precautionary measures to strengthen its border defenses. Foreign statements involving Portugal have not been publicly announced in the past, but the bulletin issued last night, announcing the deployment of additional troops to defend the three Portuguese islands to safeguard Portuguese sovereignty, openly informed the Portuguese public that these three islands have been mentioned by the US Senate. Although the talk that the war may involve Portugal has often been met with condemnation, the government's issuance of a bulletin denying rumors spread by news agencies and radio stations is the first time. After the bulletin disclosed the US government's assurance of absolute respect for Portuguese sovereignty, it stated that the Portuguese government has not received any requests or suggestions from any belligerent or other country to use its ports or bases on the Portuguese mainland or its Atlantic islands. The bulletin responded to Senator Pepper's statement that the UK and the US should jointly occupy places such as the Portuguese Azores and Cape Verde Islands to prevent Germany from taking the lead, saying that although Portugal believes that other countries will not attack its territory, if they do, Portugal is capable of resisting them.

<h3>British Ambassador to the United States Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Minneapolis - British Ambassador Halifax said in a speech at the Rotary Club yesterday that victory depends on production and transportation. There are now signs that for every item produced by an authoritarian country, there will be two items produced by free nations in opposition. This date is approaching. The Nazis will soon be unable to plunder new spoils, such as France and the Netherlands, and will have to use their own reserves. This date is also approaching. There can be no compromise in this war. Death is far better than being enslaved by Hitler. Germany is again carrying out new terror in Poland on a large scale, using cruel, meticulous, and scientific methods, practicing barbarism unprecedented since Genghis Khan. In recent months, approximately 40,000 Poles have been killed. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>

<h3>British Troops Gain Air Supremacy; Iraqi Resistance Has Become a Spent Force; British Reinforcements Continuously Arrive in Iraq to Provide Support; The Rutbah Airfield Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>Cairo - Iraq, under heavy British attack, is showing signs of disintegration in its resistance. London has stated that the Iraqi Air Force no longer exists. British vehicles have occupied the high ground outside the Habbaniyah Airfield, and the unstable elements of the Iraqi forces surrounding the airfield have retreated to Fallujah and Ramadi. British special forces are very active in both locations. The situation in Basra is calm. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Even if the British Air Force has not completely destroyed Ali Gaylani's Air Force, it has already defeated it. Official sources said that Gaylani's Air Force no longer has the ability to fight. A senior British Air Force official said that since the Iraqi Air Force has been eliminated, it will certainly not be able to launch any more air offensives. The British Air Force launched a final destructive strike on the airfield north of Baghdad and Gaylani's Air Force base on Thursday. Gaylani's Air Force base caught fire on Thursday morning and was still burning fiercely in the afternoon. The British Air Force Command in the Middle East recently issued a statement on the situation of the heavy blow to the Iraqi army in the Habbaniyah area in the past two days, stating that in addition to inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi army, it has also seized a large amount of war equipment, including six howitzers, many other cannons, and many armored vehicles. Twenty-five enemy aircraft were shot down. The Iraqi airfields were also heavily bombed. The British women and children in Baghdad at the start of the war have been evacuated to Basra, and most have left Iraq by sea to India. After the American-made transport planes of the British Air Force carried reinforcements from India to Habbaniyah, one of them carried more than 200 British women south to Basra, and was shot at by Iraqi forces en route. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Beirut - According to telegrams received here from Amman, 2,000 British troops are now gathered on the Saudi Arabian border, under the command of Colonel Ballard-Hurst. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Well-informed Turkish sources here have confirmed reports that demonstrations against Iraqi Prime Minister Gaylani took place in Baghdad on Thursday. It is reported that similar protests also occurred in Mosul and Kirkuk on the same day. According to officially confirmed news this morning, British troops have driven the rebels out of the important Rutbah airfield. The airfield has now been recovered by the British Air Force. Rutbah is located 250 miles west of Baghdad and is a station on the air route to India, and is also located on the oil pipeline from northeastern Iraq to Haifa. In addition to driving the Iraqi army out of the suburbs of Habbaniyah, the British army is now in pursuit. Most of the Iraqi Air Force has been destroyed. The British army captured a large number of military supplies and inflicted heavy losses on the Iraqi army. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London - The British military operations in Iraq appear to be achieving great success. As a result of the British Air Force's complete control of the air, Gaylani and his followers are hesitating on which path to take in their future actions. If Gaylani cannot achieve some victories, the dissatisfaction of his followers with him will increase day by day. The most reliable information says that the report that Gaylani has fled Baghdad is not true. Political figures here believe that Britain will absolutely not accept any mediation and compromise with Gaylani, but Britain does not give up cooperation with another Iraqi government, even if the Iraqi government not only restores the power of the former regent, but also establishes a cabinet led by people from Gaylani's previous administrative department, it is not a problem. There is still no confirmation here regarding rumors that Vichy has allowed German troops to use Syrian airfields or engage in any important activities in Syria. However, British figures are already watching this situation with close attention and anxiety. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Army Appoints Two Domestic Commanders</h3>

It is reported that Iran, Afghanistan, and other Arab nationalist countries have expressed their solidarity with Iraq in resisting foreign aggression. As for Turkey's attitude towards the British-Iraqi war, it has not yet been clearly stated, because Turkey has not recognized the Iraqi government. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<h3>British and Allied Ships Lost Last Month: 106 Vessels, Totaling 488,000 Tons</h3>

<h3>Two German Armed Merchant Ships Lost: One in the Indian Ocean, One in the North Sea</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced yesterday that two German auxiliary vessels were destroyed. One was a merchant raider sunk in the Indian Ocean. This is the first time a German raider has been sunk in the Indian Ocean. The other was an armed minesweeper sunk in the North Sea. The German raider sunk in the Indian Ocean by the British ship "Cornwall" may have been the former Hansa merchant ship, displacing 10,000 tons, with a speed of 19 knots, and armed with six 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes and minelaying equipment. Such raiders carry a large number of crew members so that they can dispatch crews to operate captured enemy ships. The ship sunk by the British ship "Cornwall" carried a total of 300 crew members. The British Admiralty stated that the British Navy is intensifying patrols in the Indian Ocean to eliminate raiders from the shipping lanes. This is the first successful strike, as the main supplies from Australia or the United States are now heading to the Middle East battlefield via the Indian Ocean. It was also reported that a British naval patrol ship encountered the German "Montevideo" (5,619 tons) in the North Sea. This ship was originally a passenger ship but had been converted into an armed minesweeper. After an exchange of fire, the "Montevideo" was scuttled, and all crew members were rescued and taken prisoner. (International News, 10th)</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the European War (53): Hitler's Desire for the Near East</h3>
<p>Modern warfare cannot be carried out without oil. Airplanes, warships, tanks, artillery vehicles, and transport vehicles cannot move without oil as fuel. How can one even talk about warfare? Hitler's desire for the Near East has more than one strategic reason, but the main reason cannot be separated from the oil issue. Of course, after he controlled Romania, the oil reserves there could be used by him, but in fact, the consumption of oil in this war is considerable. It would be best if the oil fields of Iraq could also be brought under German control, or at least not be used by Britain, reducing the power of the British Navy in the Mediterranean. The general situation of oil in the Near East and its relationship to this European war are explained below:</p>
<p>The country with the highest oil production in the world is the United States, accounting for 60% of the total, with an annual production of approximately 280 million tons. The Soviet Union and Venezuela each account for 10%. Therefore, the production of these three countries accounts for 80% of the world's total. The Dutch East Indies and Mexico each produce 6 million tons annually. Romania, under Hitler's control, also produces about 6 million tons annually. Further east, Iraq produces 4 million tons annually, and Iran produces 10 million tons.</p>
<p>Hitler's attack on the Near East is a means. His ultimate goal is, of course, still on Britain. Therefore, we must first understand the oil production situation in Britain and Germany. Britain can be said to have almost no oil production. However, its navy is strong, dominates the sea, and has a large tonnage of oil tankers, allowing it to move freely at sea. Even in peacetime, 60% of Britain's annual oil consumption comes from across the Atlantic. Since the German army has successively captured major cities in Europe, the European oil market has long been closed. As a result, Britain imports even more from the United States. When necessary, Britain can also obtain supplies from Iraq and the Dutch East Indies in the east via sea routes. The transportation routes are the Mediterranean or around the Cape of Good Hope. The world's oil consumption has not increased compared to before the war, and has even decreased due to the efforts of various countries to implement controls.</p>
<p>Under any circumstances, the United States' oil production and its rich underground reserves always rank first. Even before the war, the serious problem of excess oil had not been resolved. For this reason, as long as the British Navy can hold the sea, the supply of oil will not be difficult. In terms of oil tankers, Britain was originally one of the best in the world, and now Britain owns many Norwegian oil tankers, the tonnage of which ranks third in the world. As for the United States' oil tankers, although not as good as Britain's, helping to transport oil to Britain is also no problem. In terms of oil transportation, Britain certainly has an advantage over Germany.</p>
<p>What is the situation of Germany's oil supply? Unlike Britain, Germany has some small oil fields within its territory. In addition, Germans also refine a kind of substitute oil, and there are many such refineries. In short, for Germany (including Austria, Czechoslovakia, and western Poland), domestic oil production in 1941 was approximately 4 million tons. This number is certainly not satisfactory to the Germans, because even in peacetime, Germany's annual consumption requires 6 million tons. As for Greater Germany, Italy, and other occupied countries combined, the annual consumption requires 20 million tons. In addition to supplying the huge amount of consumption by the army and air force on the battlefield, Germany must also take care of the daily uses of the country, its ally Italy – which has no oil production itself – and other occupied countries with its own oil production and imports from abroad.</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany must solve the oil problem by seeing how much foreign countries can supply. Romania's oil fields can produce 6 million tons of crude oil annually. Now that Romania is under German control, there is no need to plan any further regarding the oil problem. Since Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression pact, everyone thought that Germany could obtain a large amount of oil from the Soviet Union. In fact, although the Soviet Union's production ranks second in the world, its domestic industrial and agricultural sectors have been vigorously developed in the past decade, and oil consumption is very large. Apart from the transportation problem, it is impossible for the Soviet Union to transport oil abroad without affecting the domestic economic situation. In 1939, the Soviet Union exported only 500,000 tons of oil. Under the current circumstances, no matter what threats are made, the Soviet Union can give up everything, but it will never hand over the Caucasus oil fields to others.</p>
<p>The Baku oil fields, which the Germans are coveting, and the oil production in northern Iraq and the Persian Gulf, will have to be seized sooner or later. Currently, only Romania is under control, but there is no way to transport the 6 million tons produced by Romania annually to Germany, because oil transportation is different from other types of transportation. It is not like timber or coal, which can be loaded on any ship or train, or stacked anywhere. Oil transportation must use specially made ships or trains, and ports and stations must have tank cars and pipeline equipment, and there must also be warehouses and tank cars along the way for transshipment at any time. The transportation lines between Germany and Romania are the Danube River and two or three east-west railways.</p>
<p>From all perspectives, Germany can only obtain approximately 2 million tons of oil from Romania this year. Even if the domestic oil refineries can continue to operate as usual and include some other small sources, Germany can only obtain 6 million tons to supply countries that normally consume 20 million tons annually. The oil needed by the German military on various battlefields is not even counted in this number.</p>

<h3>US Government Personnel Arresting Italian Residents, Simultaneously Using "Dollar Diplomacy" to Undermine German and Italian Aviation Foundations in South America, Germany Protests US Confiscation of Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>Washington - Federal government personnel yesterday began arresting 90 Italian foreigners who were previously employed at the Italian exhibition at the New York World's Fair. Their crime is having expired passports and illegally entering the US. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - Yesterday, many armed police officers, detectives, and immigration agents raided luxurious hotels, restaurants, and clubs, conducting lightning-fast arrests of Italian residents. A total of 101 Italian residents were arrested, and the search continued for 15 other residents who had overstayed their visas. This large-scale arrest of Italian residents follows closely after the search and arrest of German sailors in various US ports on Thursday. (International News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - One hundred and sixty German sailors were arrested on Wednesday. It is now heard that several Italian sailors have also been arrested, and dozens more are being searched because their period of stay in the US has exceeded the permitted time limit. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned yesterday that the US government has embarked on a large-scale campaign to eliminate German and Italian aviation routes in Latin America, and considers this move a major part of the Western Hemisphere defense program. Informed sources claim that "American dollar diplomacy" is being used to undermine the Axis powers' aviation foundations in South America. It is said that Germany and Italy have been developing commercial aviation routes in South America for a long time and have reached a point where American airlines have difficulty competing. According to information obtained by the US government, these aviation routes could be converted to military use if needed after the Axis powers win. In their opinion, the Axis powers' development of aviation in South America is a clever strategy to strengthen control over South American countries. Its support for Axis power is complementary to Axis-run newspapers, "cultural" groups, and trade organizations. It is alleged that the airports used by German airlines can be converted into air force bases for attacking the United States. The German government also provides subsidies to make their fees lower than those of American airlines. The US government is observing this problem from a military perspective, rather than purely from a commercial perspective, so it has changed its approach and is planning how to undermine the Axis powers' aviation foundations in South America. (International News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US Attorney General announced last night that the United States has seized the funds of a German dye trust because the trust refused to appear in court after being sued under the anti-trust law, claiming that it does not operate in the United States and is not subject to US law. Therefore, the United States seized its funds. This trust is the strongest of the German forces and has considerable power to influence US industry. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin - An officially authorized spokesman confirmed yesterday that Germany has protested to the United States regarding the US Congress's plan to authorize the President to confiscate Nazi ships, but did not add any further comments. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to reliable sources, Germany has made its first protest against the US's aid to Britain in its diplomatic note protesting the US confiscation of foreign ships, claiming that the US's supply of its ships to Britain has reduced the number of US ships, and President Roosevelt cannot therefore claim that there is a state of tension in the shipping industry.

<h3>British Air Force Launches Fierce Attack on Northern German Industrial Centers, Dropping Tens of Thousands of Bombs, Flames Soaring into the Sky, Hamburg and Bremen Suffer Particularly Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>London - Information from the Air Ministry indicates that the British Air Force's attacks on Hamburg and Bremen were unprecedented in scale. More British bombers were used than ever before, dropping tens of thousands of incendiary bombs and hundreds of tons of high-explosive bombs. The two cities were bombed, shrouded in thick smoke, and the fire was extremely intense. Only a sea of flames soaring into the sky could be seen. German submarine docks and shipyards were also heavily bombed and caught fire. The moonlight and weather were favorable for the air raid. Although the Germans claimed that their defenses dispersed the attacking British planes, the British planes were not hindered by enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire and continued to fly in batches over Hamburg and Bremen, dropping all of their bombs on designated targets. Pilots reported "terrifying explosions" and "the most powerful bombs dropped into the center of the fire." A German communique said that on Thursday night, British planes flew over Berlin, reaching as far as the Posen area of Poland, and the areas along the northwestern border, including Hamburg and Bremen, were hit by large numbers of British planes dropping explosive and incendiary bombs. Factories were damaged, but the most severe damage was to residential areas, and civilian casualties were heavy. The German communique also stated, "German planes attacked factories in Hull and the Midlands area of Nottingham in England, as well as ports in southern England, causing extensive damage." According to the Air Ministry, the number of British planes attacking Germany on Thursday night was unprecedented. They began leaving England in broad daylight, flying east in continuous batches, with the largest German seaports of Bremen and Hamburg as the main targets of the attack. German heavy and light anti-aircraft guns and night fighters attacked, but were repeatedly driven back by British planes. However, one bomber crashed after engaging with a German fighter. Although German defenses were strong, the intensity of the British attacks was no less than those on Berlin, Emden, and other targets in northwestern Germany. A total of ten British planes were missing. The Hamburg and Bremen shipyards building submarines were heavily bombed, and the industrial areas were also severely damaged, with fires breaking out everywhere. Oil depots in both cities were hit and thick smoke billowed upwards, causing extremely heavy damage. On Thursday night, British planes flew over northern France and Belgium, dropping bombs on German airfields. A German fighter-bomber was hit by British planes, caught fire, and crashed into a forest a few miles from the airfield, exploding in flames. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Over England</h3>
<p>London - Today, in the bright sunlight, German planes made reconnaissance flights over the southwest coast of England. The British fighter patrol engaged them and drove them back. A small squadron of enemy planes flew over the Strait of Dover and tried to use cloud cover to fly inland, but because the northeasterly wind was very strong, the clouds moved quickly, leaving the enemy planes with no cover to rely on. As a result, they encountered British fighters and engaged in a fierce battle. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Yinqian Cup Basketball Finals: Shanghai Bank Wins Championship, Central Savings Society Loses 14-21, Women's Exhibition: Friendly Team Jingwu Draws</h3>
<p>The final of the 3rd Yinqian Cup Basketball Tournament, sponsored by the Shanghai Banking and Monetary Industry Association, between the Shanghai Bank and the Central Savings Society, was held last night at the Baxianqiao Youth Gymnasium. Shanghai Bank cooperated better and finally won the championship with a score of 21 to 14. In the first half, each team scored four points. In last year's final, Shanghai Bank was defeated by the Central Savings Society, so this year's victory was a revenge. Last night, the two teams were evenly matched, and the competition was fierce and intense. Both sides lacked skill in shooting, so the scores were low. Only one or two out of ten free throws were made. Each team scored four points in the first half, which shows the situation of the game. In the second half, Central Savings Society's star player Qu Xilin was fouled out after four fouls, and Shanghai Bank took the lead. After 13 to 12, Shanghai Bank had a smooth run and won with 21 to 14. Before the game, in a women's basketball exhibition, Jingwu and the Friendly Team drew 21 to 21. In the first half, Jingwu led 16 to 14. Huang Mingyuan of the Friendly Team was very active.</p>

<h3>Food: Hoarding Tigers Unwilling to Let the Public Have Food, Constantly Thinking of Undermining Public Sales, No Matter How Rumors are Created, They Ultimately Cannot Defeat the Facts, Suffering the General Public Who Want to Get Rich, Falling into the Trap of Big Players</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Yang Rice market initially rose and then fell, resulting in an increase of 235 yuan compared to the previous day. The market's sudden rises and falls have not yet reached a stable path. After the market opened in the morning, due to the continuous sharp decline in prices in recent days, the big hoarding players were feeling frustrated. They hoped that the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to transport rice monthly to supply the people of Shanghai would fail. Yesterday, they spread rumors in the market again, claiming that the rice stored in Hong Kong had been frozen by the Hong Kong government, and that transportation would be more complicated in the future. Therefore, it would be difficult for Hong Kong rice to come to Shanghai, and even the 50,000 bags that had already been processed would be delayed. When the rice parasites heard this, they were overjoyed, thinking it was true. Everyone applauded and cheered, "Heaven blesses the profiteers who cut off people's food!" All the rice parasites, hoarders, market manipulators, and speculators were mixing things up. New hoarding players continued to absorb the supply, and floating households were also quite anxious. Therefore, the market situation was quite tight in the morning, and all prices soared, with the highest price increasing by about ten yuan compared to the closing price of the previous morning. However, after this commotion, general merchants knew that there was no hope for the future of rice prices. They also confirmed that the low-priced processed rice would arrive on schedule, and that the second batch would also be shipped. Furthermore, the rice supply to Shanghai was not subject to the freeze, and the first batch of tribute rice from the French Concession authorities had also been shipped, with the same quantity as the processed rice shipped from Hong Kong. The market then weakened again. In fact, all of this was a sign that the big hoarding players were unwilling to give up, unwilling to let the public have food. Therefore, they were constantly thinking of undermining the Shanghai Municipal Council's food policy for the service of the public. There were also some unscrupulous merchants who wanted to take advantage of the high prices to sell their goods, so they constantly created rumors and manipulated the market. However, facts speak louder than rumors. A large number of spot goods poured out, and the profitable players sold them off. Suddenly, the market was flooded with goods, and sales became scarce. Furthermore, actual sales were not seen to be increasing. As a result, the market crashed, and prices fell sharply. At the close of the market, the price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 128 yuan, down from the initial price of 133 yuan. No. 1 Siamese rice was 125 yuan, processed rice was 120 yuan from the initial price of 126 yuan, Mindang rice was 120 yuan, broken rice was 97 yuan. The original packaged processed rice from the Yinghua Company for April and May was 146-147 yuan, and No. 1 rice was 150 yuan to 147.5 yuan, Road rice was 151-152 yuan, broken rice was 114-115 yuan to 119 yuan, and 115-116 yuan in the afternoon. A total of 6,000 bags of spot rice and nearly 1,000 tons of original packaged rice were traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice saw Yang rice return tightly, sales were slightly more active, and cargo owners' determination to sell was firm, so prices rose accordingly, with an increase of four or five yuan. The quoted price for original packaged Xijing rice was 142 yuan, and Kunshan offered Zhongguan white japonica rice at 133 yuan. Original packaged early and late indica rice from Nangang was 140 yuan to 137-138 yuan. The quoted price for rice in bulk was not available.</p>
<p>Yesterday, glutinous rice was also bought by cake shops and food vendors, and it also became tighter, but it was still difficult to compete with Yang rice. The quoted price for Hong Kong white glutinous rice was 123-124 yuan, and glutinous tea rice was 114 yuan.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>The tapioca vermicelli market has rebounded. After the continuous sharp decline in recent days, Jinlong brand kan vermicelli once fell below the 31 yuan mark. Based on the current market situation, it is considered cheap. Therefore, merchants and actual sellers gradually absorbed it at low prices. Furthermore, the rice market rebounded, and news of the tense situation in the Pacific caused people's hearts to stabilize. The market sentiment turned from decline to prosperity. More than 3,000 bags of Jinlong vermicelli were traded, and the price rose from 31.5 yuan to 32 yuan. 1,000 bags of Yangpaotai brand vermicelli were also offered, and the price rose from 31.7 yuan to 32.2 yuan, an increase of seven or eight cents compared to the previous day. The flat-priced vermicelli from Chinese factories remained the same. Fuxin Factory released more than 5,000 bags, and the price remained at 29 yuan.</p>
<p>There was no trade in wheat. Chinese and Japanese factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the demand for raw materials. There is also a lack of supply of spot goods in the market, so the market remains stagnant. The formal market will have to wait for the new wheat to be available.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Follows the Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake and miscellaneous grains market still could not escape the influence of the rice market. Therefore, soybean oil continued the upward trend of the previous day, rising three or four yuan in the morning. More than 100 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, with a price of 176.5 yuan to 177 yuan. 100 dan of Dayou factory oil was traded, with a price of 127 yuan. Corn also rose by about one yuan in the morning, but fell back by half a yuan in the afternoon. A total of more than 1,000 bags of spot goods and 50 tons of futures were traded. Due to the lack of special stimulus, soybeans lacked enthusiasm, and trading was distant. Therefore, with the situation of flat actual sales in both arrival and storage, prices fell frequently. Yesterday, only 300 bags of Tianjin soybeans were purchased by the local street and oil pressing factories, with a price of 48.5 yuan. 1,300-1,400 bags of Guide soybeans were traded, with a price of 46 yuan to 45.1 yuan. Soybean cake fluctuated greatly, with the overall trend being large at first and then small, still under the control of speculative manipulation.</p>
<p>Also, 565 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Have Decreased</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listings. Fluctuations in the black market for British and American exchange rates have decreased, as gold prices have entered a consolidation phase. After the market opened in the morning, Chinese speculators tried to push up prices, while British and American commercial banks had a strong appetite for buying. The market showed signs of tightening. Later, Chinese banks Jincheng and Zhexing sold off, balancing the supply and demand. Finally, British gold settled at 3/4d 2 8125, a slight increase of 0.015625. The American exchange rate was flat, remaining at 5.34375 yuan. Trading was lackluster in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Gradually Seen to Balance</p>
<p>Since the morning news from abroad showed a slight increase in Indian silver, and large bars and American banks were flat, exchange rates for all countries against Shanghai were down five points against the US dollar, and the rest were flat. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The early opening price for spot goods was 3/4d 2 65625 for British exchange, and the American dollar was flat, remaining at 5.34375 yuan. Speculators initially tried to sell next month's US dollars at 5.375 yuan, and Macgregor and Chase Manhattan successively absorbed them, hindering the market's downward trend. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. After a 24.50% silver equalization tax was still levied, Chinese banks Zhexing and Jincheng successively sold to a certain broker and also benefited from the May US dollar at 5.375 yuan. Later, some speculators took profits and started to buy back this month's 5.34375 yuan, but were unsuccessful. At noon, the price of gold rose to nearly 6,500 yuan and once softened to only settle at 5.3125. It then returned to flat. At noon, the spot and futures prices for British exchange were both 3/4d 2 8125, and the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan, an increase of 0.015625 and flat, respectively, compared to the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 10th (Saturday) - This morning, the exchange market opened flat. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars rose by 50 cents to 455.5 yuan (the previous close was 455 yuan). There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Rates Increase</p>
<p>Tianjin, 10th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate eased by 0.03125 to 3/4d 3 34375. The New York telegraphic transfer rate increased by 0.0625 to 5.4275. The black market rates for Shanghai exchange and "United Notes" remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Economic Talks: Feng Liusheng - Bank Weekly</h3>
<p>The first periodical in China to discuss economic texts was Bank Weekly. Before Bank Weekly, there were magazines published, and one could occasionally see economic texts, but they focused on politics, middle school literature, and art, while this one focused entirely on economic texts, without mentioning other things.</p>
<p>The establishment of Bank Weekly was due to the efforts of Zhang Gongquan. At that time, Zhang Gongquan was the deputy manager of the Shanghai Bank of China. In the Shanghai banking community at that time, which was full of old forces, Zhang Gongquan was a leader of the new intellectuals. In the summer of 1917, Zhang Gongquan invited Zhu Qinglai, Xu Jiqing, Fan Jimei, and Xu Yongzuo to his residence. At that time, Zhang's residence seemed to be in a Western-style house near Laobaizi Road. As a result of this conversation, Bank Weekly was born soon after.</p>
<p>Zhang served as the editor-in-chief, with Zhu Qinglai and Xu Yongzuo as editors, and Xu Jiqing and Fan Jimei taking part of the business affairs. Because Zhang served as the editor-in-chief, Bank Weekly at that time had many of Zhang's texts. They worked in a room in the Bank of China on Hankou Road. The current address of the company, 59 Xianggang Road, was moved after the new building of the Bank Association was completed.</p>
<p>Later, Liang Qichao took over as Minister of Finance, and immediately promoted Zhang Gongquan to Deputy Governor of the Bank of China. When he arrived in Beijing, Xu Yongzuo became the editor-in-chief, with Xu Cangshui taking over as the Japanese correspondent, Yang Duanlu as the London correspondent, Chen Qinghua as the New York correspondent, and Pan Shihao, Zhu Yinong, Feng Ziming, Xu Yusun, and Liu Zhonglian taking over the editing. Talents gathered. Therefore, Bank Weekly's reputation grew day by day. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Gold Market Lingers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in both the open market and the black market showed a circular trend, falling first and then rising, once rising close to the 6,500 yuan mark. People's hearts turned from tired to unstable. The American exchange rate was absorbed by British and American commercial banks, hindering the downward trend. It was not easy to break through 5.375 yuan, so securities firms and silver firms tried to sell heavily after the market opened in the morning, pushing the price back to 6,435 yuan. Soon after, they came to compete with the Qianzhuang for profit. The short positions took profits and began to buy back, and the rebound started to rise, reaching 6,495 yuan at noon. It finally rose 2 yuan against the downtrend. After the close, gold and securities firms suddenly came to sell, and the price fell again to 6,450 yuan. About 50,000 taels were traded in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The off-market price has stabilized, and the cash price has rebounded slightly. First, Defu offered 100 taels of Zhongxing, with a price 240 yuan higher than the futures price. Then, they continued to sell 200 taels, and Chiren offered 100 taels, and Fukangyong offered 80 taels, all 230 yuan higher, and Chengji bought them, which was 20 yuan less than the previous day. The prices of decorative gold and custom gold were both flat.</p>
<p>The Downtrend for Pure Gold is Certain</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the weak trend after the close of the previous day. The market opened 35 yuan lower at 9:15 AM, at 6,450 yuan. Then, it fluctuated rapidly. Tongkangyong and Shunyuan tried to sell heavily, so the price rose to 6,470 yuan, and then fell back to 6,448 yuan. Dafeng, Chengji, and Defu bought in, and the price rose again to 6,475 yuan. Yida, Tongkangyong, Hengji tried to sell heavily, and retail investors pressed down sharply. At 9:50 AM, the price fell to 6,435 yuan, which was pulled up by the strong buying of Dafeng, Xinfengyong, Decheng, Yifeng, Shunyuan, and Defu, who saw the low price. Foreign exchange also turned from loose to soft, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the price rose sharply and fell back slightly, rising to 6,495 yuan at noon. Tianyuan tried to sell heavily, and the price fell back to 6,475 yuan. The floating shorts went in again, and at noon the market closed at 6,487 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. According to the settlement price of 5.34375 yuan for the May US dollar, the price was 6,517 yuan, down 30 yuan. After the close of the market, Defu, Chengji, Gongda, and Hesheng sold off, and the price fell to 6,455 yuan. Yida advanced to 6,465 yuan. Finally, gold and securities firms were still selling, and the price was 6,450 yuan. The price fluctuated by 60 yuan in the morning. There was a selling household with an off-market price of 6,450 yuan in the afternoon. The selling price of gold in the gold shop was 250 yuan higher than the futures price of pure gold, and the received price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. The current price for standard gold was still unavailable.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate for Decorative Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of decorative gold per tael in silver shops, both Datonghang and Xintonghang, remained at 695 yuan, with a 40 yuan reduction for purchases.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Gradually Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a clear flat and dark falling market for pure gold, so the British and American gold pounds were also down by one yuan. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price was flat. The price of American gold notes gradually stabilized, and finally fell by 4 cents, with a closing price of 18.44 yuan. Hong Kong is expected to continue to weaken. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes was still balanced, and the evening market remained at 2.07 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was strong, and the market price was weak, falling to 1.77 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Are Narrow, Japanese Yarn is Cheaper, Double Horse Difficult to Rise Temporarily</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen miserably the previous day, stabilized slightly yesterday. This is because there was naturally a possibility of stabilization after the huge drop of 100 yuan in two days. However, the actual position has no ability to rise temporarily, because there is a lack of sales. The price of 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn is low, and the trend is even more stagnant. At the same time, there is sufficient inventory. Once the double horse loosens, there are no buyers to accept it, and Japanese yarn is allowed to be sold cheaply. Therefore, in this regard, cotton yarn itself is difficult to rise temporarily. However, some bulls with sufficient economic resources are still buying in the same amount, so the market can still be supported for a while. However, most of the floating bulls have already fled. As for the buyer's discussion, the current international situation is increasingly urgent, the foreign exchange rate is rising, and the standard gold is falling. All kinds of goods have been falling recently. The obstruction of cotton yarn shipping has caused most bulls to give up. In this way, it would not be surprising to see the downside market price below 1,400 yuan. The high price for 20-count double horse was 1,486 yuan, and the low price was 1,470 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the lack of market in the weekend black market, someone said that it was done at 1,473 yuan. There will be 1,150 pieces of yarn shipped to Hong Kong tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Double Horse market opened in the morning due to the slightly higher closing price in the afternoon of the previous day, and people's morale stabilized slightly. The first plate price was 1,485 yuan, but there were few buyers for this plate. Because after the big drop the previous day, the general bulls were exhausted and unable to struggle, so the market situation had become scattered. Shortly after, the standard gold opened flat, and there were many sellers on the table. The situation turned weak, falling to 1,477 yuan. However, a certain party of bulls came again to pull a few bags, and returned to 1,481 yuan. After that, it circled at 1,478-1,479 yuan for a long time. Later, with a slight increase in the standard gold, it rose to 1,486 yuan. When the market closed, it weakened again to 1,471 yuan. The statistics of the turnover of 9,770 bags in the morning are listed as follows. Hong Kong 220, Same Industry 9,500, Total 9,720.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Rises and Falls, Speculators Laugh and Cry: A Hidden Account of the Wild Fluctuations in Cotton Yarn Prices in April</h3>
<p>(1) Before the Spring Holiday on April 15th, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,430 yuan. At this time, securities firms and some speculators were bearish, because the inventory of Double Horse yarn was abundant, and the factories, in order to reduce inventory, offered incentives for export, offering a subsidy of 100 yuan per bale if it was indeed shipped to other ports. As a result, "Rewards bring forth brave men." Guangdong merchants purchased a batch and shipped it to Hong Kong for storage. According to investigations, they bought as many as six or seven thousand bales successively, which naturally reduced the inventory in Shanghai. However, there was a large profit to be made in spot goods in other ports.</p>
<p>(2) Speculators seized the opportunity to exaggerate and became very active, spreading rumors in the market that inventory was decreasing, the supply was drying up, and due to the electricity conservation issue imposed by the Municipal Council, factories were forced to reduce production. They claimed that the market would see prices skyrocket to 1,600 or 1,700 yuan, and also said that everything else was expensive except cotton yarn. This triggered a buying frenzy, with more buying than selling for a time, making it difficult to meet the demand. The market squeezed, and prices gradually rose, reaching 1,586 yuan on May 5th. With the situation looking good, of course, people went long, absorbing more inventory.</p>
<p>(3) Unexpectedly, the price of Double Horse yarn was forced higher due to excessive speculation. However, when the price became too high, the foundation could not be sound. How can we see this? Looking at the reasons, although a portion of Double Horse yarn was removed by shipping it out, the goods from various factories producing miscellaneous brands of yarn were piled up like mountains. Moreover, since the military conflict in Eastern Zhejiang, transportation was obstructed, and sales plummeted. Therefore, standard yarn ran forward blindly, but miscellaneous brands of yarn were like wooden donkeys, trying to catch up and breaking their legs, creating an ever-widening gap in market prices. The discrepancy between Double Horse and similar-count yarn, which should have been 220 or 230 yuan cheaper, was astonishing. The above situation was enough to deal a fatal blow to Double Horse yarn.</p>
<p>(4) When the market is high, it is also exposed to the danger of attracting wind, and once it encounters a storm, the waves break apart. Moreover, everyone being long made the reaction even more drastic. Some speculators are either long or short, and their methods are relatively flexible. Unexpectedly, rumors abounded, saying that the situation in the Pacific was tense, and goods could not be shipped from Hong Kong. In addition, the exchange rate soared, and the margin deposit plummeted. Frequent bad news caused the bullish sentiment to waver, and a large number of holdings were released. Tens of thousands of bales of supply could not withstand this reversal, and as a result, the small speculators suffered, often losing their shirts.</p>
<p>(5) Some people also say that lately, commercial news shows everything is in decline. It is also said that the price of 42-count yarn used to soar, but now it has plummeted by 100 or 200 yuan. The price of 32-count yarn has also fallen and lacks a market. Japanese yarn of the same count is even cheaper. All sorts of arguments have once again favored the short side. However, at present, commodity prices are high, and factory costs have increased. The key to future ups and downs still depends on the level of consumption. It is better to rely on this than to rely solely on buying from A and selling to B. Such manipulations cannot consolidate the foundation. The extent of the majority's psychological pullback may be around 1,400 yuan. This year's cotton yarn market belongs to a tug-of-war, so some speculators may win, but the rest are still frowning, unable to meet their expenses. Why bother? Most big companies will profit, but the best are the small companies that skim the remaining profits and return fully loaded. How wonderful! (Jing)</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Cools Down</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is as calm as ever, so transactions are completely at a standstill. The market has been hit by the falling yarn market, and factories are helpless.</p>
<p>Fire-engine grass bales 194 [unclear unit], Xie Xin 130 bales delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Shanghai's foreign cotton trade has been affected by the weakness of the yarn market, the rising exchange rate, and the instability of the international situation. All parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Factories have no appetite, and colleagues have not engaged in purchases. However, the cotton market is slightly different from the yarn market. The price of American cotton is quite high, and the inventory in Shanghai is not large. Therefore, if the situation improves, the cotton market still has hope of remaining strong.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is seeing enthusiastic buying due to Washington political news favoring the bulls and good cotton cloth trade conditions. The market is constantly active and firm as a result. Yesterday's closing price was 25-26 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Another telegram: American cotton statistics from August 1st last year to May 9th this year are recorded on the left (per 500-pound bale):</p>
<p>Cumulative Listing: 10,668,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Factory Use: 8,051,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports: 910,000 bales</p>
<p>To Japan: 96,000 bales</p>
<p>To China: 60,200 bales</p>
<p>To England: 56,000 bales</p>
<p>To Germany: 139,000 bales</p>
<p>Port City Inventory: 6,093,000 bales</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is relatively flat, with closing prices mixed, rising or falling by 1-2 rupees. A forecast of today's opening market situation is given, with prices expected to be higher by more than a few rupees because of the strong rise in American cotton.</p>
<p>Also, Indian cotton is being transshipped to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's ship "Fu Sheng" arrived from Hong Kong with 3,921 pieces of Indian cotton, docking at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Seems to Turn Stronger</h3>
<p>—Two Foreign Firms Distribute Dividends—</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds showed a slight improvement yesterday. There were rumors in the market of peace talks, but knowledgeable people did not find them credible. Market prices were generally raised by small retail investors buying in at two or three jiao above previous prices. Category A bonds still did not trade, and confidence remained weak. Local retail investors buying in did little to affect the overall market. Yesterday was Saturday, and there was only one trading session in the morning. Tong Kang and Shun Chang bought slightly, but most of the buying came from individual retail investors buying 5,000 to 10,000 [unclear unit]. Lianhe and Hongda both sold off. Category C bonds rose by four jiao, but still could not be pulled up. In the end, except for Category A bonds, which did not trade, the rest were slightly better by two or three jiao. The total turnover was about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock transactions, 100 shares of a trust company were traded at a price of 15 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.</p>

It is also learned that the company's board of directors has resolved to announce its self-liquidation and will convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in the near future to discuss the liquidation matters.</p>
<p>Crawford &amp; Co., Ltd., managed by the British firm Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co., is scheduled to convene its 31st annual general meeting on June 3rd. The company's net profit for 1940 totaled more than 910,000 yuan in national currency. In addition to the interim dividend of 2 jiao and 5 fen per share that has already been distributed, it is proposed to pay a final dividend of 1 jiao and 5 fen, for a total of 4 jiao for the whole year.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Weak and the Situation Has Not Improved</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to be weak due to weak sentiment. All parties are inclined to wait and see, and buyers are even more scarce. Retail investors are cutting out small amounts of goods, and transaction prices continue to decline. However, factory prices are not loosening, and the overall market remains relatively stable. As a result, white goods and fine cloth fell by 2 jiao and a half, coarse cloth and twill fell by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3 to 5 jiao. Over 200 pieces of cloth were traded on the street. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse cloth. Merchants from Kwangtung and Nanyang handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and twill. On the 11th, 1,495 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The spot market is still closed, so there is no official market. However, for the over-the-counter market for Dragon Head Fine Cloth, it was said that it first traded at 49 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. Afterwards, because the exchange standard continued to soften, it fell to 49 yuan and 4 jiao. Yih Wo made a transaction. Four Gentlemen Serge was offered for sale at 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen and a half per yard.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market did not fluctuate much, with only a few jiao in price changes. The guild's market price for spot goods of 24 groups of white sugar from the Outer Warehouse was 114 yuan.

<h3>Coal: Huainan Coal Has a Wide Source</h3>
<p>Huainan bituminous coal has been sluggish lately due to its wide source. The coal contains a lot of stone, so it is not favored by users and can only be mixed with high-quality goods for use. Therefore, after rising, the price has fallen back. Yesterday, the industry association opened for pricing. Huainan general coal was 310 yuan per ton, screened lumps were 330 yuan, and coal dust was 290 yuan. Ex-warehouse, delivery by own cart. Cartage costs are additional.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Transactions are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has been quiet due to the impact of the ban on the export of iron products, and the business of foreign merchants has been inactive, resulting in extreme leisure. Although local purchases have not stopped, transactions are sporadic, so the market atmosphere is abnormal, and people are also tired. The asking prices for various goods are fluctuating. The trends of various goods are briefly described below:</p>
<p>New Coil: Coil, also known as wire rod, is the raw material for manufacturing local nails. However, it is also used for other purposes, such as in the construction industry and by screw factories. However, because its asking price is expensive, transactions are not very active. Wholesale transactions, in particular, are few. The local nail factories, seeing that the sales of their finished products are not smooth and the market is weak, do not dare to purchase large quantities of raw materials, resulting in sporadic transactions. The standard market price yesterday was about 230 yuan per picul.</p>
<p>Local Wire Nails: The trade in local factory wire nails is exceptionally sparse due to the lack of interest from foreign merchants, resulting in an unusually small amount of export goods. Moreover, local speculators occasionally sell off, resulting in an oversupply of goods in circulation. Supply exceeds demand in the market, and standard prices have fallen. Compared to the price of new coil, the disparity is significant. Yesterday, the price of a barrel of Bessemer nails was only 185 yuan.</p>

<h3>Douner Returns to Shanghai After Traveling in the Interior: Praises China's Rapid Progress, Development of Various Convenient and Effective Transportation, Construction of New Buildings in the Capital and Improved Air Defense</h3>
<p>Appropriate Development of Various Industries Including Pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>Mr. Douner of the National Association of the Young Men's Christian Associations of China, recently arrived in Shanghai after completing a four-month tour in the interior. He told reporters the day before yesterday (the 9th) that convenient and effective transportation in the interior connects Free China and forms a strong and united country. He was deeply impressed by this. There are many types of transportation tools and methods, such as porters, pack horses, wheelbarrows, handcarts, motorcars, and airplanes. The transportation authorities are determined to develop the transportation system, and all officials are firmly committed to continuing their efforts.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Air Defense Equipment is Perfect</p>
<p>Regarding Chongqing, Mr. Douner stated that its air defense is unparalleled in the world, especially its air-raid shelters, which are well-equipped, many of which have running water, electricity, and wooden floors. The air-raid shelter of the Propaganda Committee is particularly well-equipped, and broadcasts can continue as usual even during air raids. Although the capital has suffered heavy damage, many temporary and permanent buildings are being constructed, such as the New Life Center, where buildings have already been completed or will be completed soon. There are also convalescent homes for wounded soldiers, sanatoriums, restaurants, and outdoor lecture halls.</p>
<p>The YMCA Has Already Rebuilt Its New Building</p>
<p>The main building of the Chongqing YMCA has been destroyed, but the dormitory has been repaired. The YMCA has recently raised 100,000 yuan to build a new building. President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife generously donated 10,000 yuan and sent a letter congratulating the YMCA on its good work in the capital. In addition to raising 100,000 yuan, the YMCA sold its old building for 120,000 yuan, totaling 220,000 yuan, to build a new building in Chongqing. The YMCA has an agency in the suburbs to assist the villagers, and its air-raid shelter can accommodate 3,000 people, with bamboo pipes to regulate the air.</p>
<p>Almost All Areas of the Southwest and Northwest Have Been Visited</p>
<p>Mr. Douner also said that he started from Qingdao to Kaifeng, rode a handcart over the sandy land to the frequently changing Yellow River ferry, then stopped in Zhengzhou, took a train to Tongguan in Luoyang, walked through the pass in a sandstorm, and then took a train through Xi'an to the terminal Baoji, transferred to a postal truck, passed through Chengdu and arrived in Chongqing after 24 hours, flew to Kunming, and then took a truck to the halfway point between Guiyang and Guilin, changed to a train, and then took the road through Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and finally arrived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Local Industries Are Developing Rapidly</p>
<p>Mr. Douner also expressed his admiration for the Chinese government's efforts to meet medical needs, and praised the work of the National Epidemic Prevention Bureau and the Chinese Red Cross Society. It is said that the two agencies assist in experiments to manufacture vaccines and other medicines. The people running these experiments are students who have studied at American medical schools. The use of domestic products in the interior is increasing, and local industries such as mining and smelting are developing rapidly. Electrical equipment, 40-50 horsepower motors, and wireless machines can all be manufactured domestically. Due to the war, the masses have moved inland on a large scale. The three YMCA locations in Changsha, Nanchang, and Guangzhou have been forced to move to new locations, but have established a foothold in less than two years, with members reaching two to three thousand people.</p>
<h3>Jin Huating: Memorial Service Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Many Friends from All Over Send Condolences. After the Reporter of Shen Bao, Jin Huating, Was Murdered, His Coffin Was Temporarily Placed in the Mainland Funeral Parlor. Tomorrow is the 100th day since his passing. The funeral arrangement at the Jin residence has been decided to be held at Huguo Temple on Mendelland Road to receive condolences. Mr. Jin had a wide range of social connections during his lifetime, and at that time, simple funeral carts and white horses, ought to be extremely mournful. It is said that recently, many friends from all over the world have sent letters and telegrams of condolence.</p>
<h3>The President Taft Leaves Shanghai</h3>
<p>The President Taft, a regular mail ship of the American President Lines, left Shanghai yesterday morning at 8 o'clock after arriving in Shanghai from the United States on the 8th, mooring at the eleventh and twelfth floating docks in the Huangpu River. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai around the 20th of this month to pick up overseas Chinese and return them to the United States.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Rice is Scheduled to Arrive Today: Food for the People is Guaranteed, The French Municipal Council Begins Rice Registration, Decides the Selling Price Will Not Exceed 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Times reported that the French Municipal Council had a meeting with rice merchants a few days ago to discuss the formation of a committee organized by rice merchants, which would be discussed by the rice merchants and controlled by the Council. A spokesman for the Council announced the day before yesterday that the price of the first batch of Saigon rice to be transported would definitely not exceed 100 yuan per shi. During the discussion on Thursday night, the rice merchants indicated to the French Concession authorities that they were determined to cooperate thoroughly with the authorities. According to the authorities, anyone who wants to purchase this rice can register with the committee, and the committee will forward the order to the French Municipal Council to facilitate purchases from Annam. In the future, the committee will be responsible for distributing the rice to various sections under the direction of the French authorities. This plan is completely the same as in the Public Concession. As for the first batch of Hong Kong rice, although it will be sold at a price of 110 yuan, the number of Hong Kong rice shipments that will arrive later is expected to be lower than this price.</p>
<p>Rice Weevils Make a Last Struggle Yesterday</p>
<p>Rice prices have plummeted by more than ten yuan in recent days. However, ordinary rice weevils are still making their last struggle, causing rice prices to be slightly raised again yesterday after a sharp drop. After the rice market opened yesterday, large hoarders, hearing that Hong Kong rice would definitely arrive in Shanghai today, believed that prices would continue to fall and that the huge amount of rice they had hoarded would not be able to be released, so they created absurd rumors to confuse the market. As a result, the prices of rice at various stalls were raised by several yuan. Later, it was learned that the Hong Kong government's food rice control measures were designed to prevent hoarding and speculation, and that rice ordered by Shanghai would be supplied as usual, so rice prices fell back in the afternoon market, eventually being illegally raised by three or four yuan.</p>
<p>Afternoon Trading is Still Active</p>
<p>The afternoon trading of the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association was proposed by the supervisory meeting of the association in October last year, and the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee decided to ban it, but soon the old habits recurred and it was revived. Because the current rice market transactions are all manipulated by speculators, the trading hours have been extended to give them more opportunities to operate. As a result, the rice price was raised by this kind of afternoon trading, so all parties hope that the on-site investigators and the responsible persons of the association should quickly investigate secretly and severely crack down on it in order to stabilize the rice market.</p>
<p>The First Batch of Hong Kong Rice Arrives Today</p>
<p>The first batch of 5,000 tons of Hong Kong rice purchased by the Public Concession Bureau is expected to arrive in Shanghai today due to weather reasons. The first carriers are the Hanyang, a ship of the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire, and the Mingsheng, a ship of the British firm Jardine Matheson. The Lijī firm, which is responsible for selling this batch of Hong Kong rice, carried out various loading and purchasing procedures yesterday. As for the rice shops, grocery stores, and rice vendors that are selling the rice, they will generally start picking up and selling the goods tomorrow because today is Sunday.</p>
<p>Rice Stock Found: 2 Million Bags</p>
<p>The current rice stock in this city has reached its most abundant period, and there is no fear of shortage in the future. According to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, the current rice stock is as follows, totaling 1,116,972 bags, an increase of 62,761 bags compared with the previous period: (1) Bank of China Warehouse: 47.63 bags; (2) Siming Bank Warehouse: 11.616 bags; (3) Zhejiang Xingye Bank: 59.167 bags; (4) China Industrial: 19.907 bags; (5) Jincheng Bank Warehouse: 16.354 bags; (6) Xinhua Bank Warehouse: 12.674 bags; (7) Donglai Bank Warehouse: 15.633 bags; (8) Jinyuan: 16.695 bags; (9) Zikang: 10.349 bags; (10) Guotai: 12.384 bags; (11) Maotai: 55.196 bags; (12) Hufeng: 14.584 bags; (13) Dinghe: 18.460 bags; (14) Roosevelt: 123.237 bags; (15) Taikoo: 74.587 bags; (16) Old Taikoo: 18.933 bags; (17) Qichang/Small Jardine Matheson: 76.334 bags; (18) Huashun: 33.212 bags; (19) Gonghexiang/Shuntai: 131.136 bags; (20) Company Warehouse: 82.124 bags; (21) Longmao: 136.175 bags. As for the retail sales of rice at various rice shops and the purchases of 4 million citizens, it is estimated that there are also more than 700,000 bags. Including the rice in the strong warehouses, the total rice stock in this city has reached about 1 million bags. The Bean and Rice Association has sent reports to the authorities of the two concessions and various rice industry organizations for their reference.</p>
<p>Rice Delivery Workers Take a Tough Stance</p>
<p>Workers who transport rice by cart oppose the rice shops entrusting the transport of rice to trucks, cutting off the livelihoods of thousands of workers, and have requested that the original situation be maintained and that the transport of rice continue to be entrusted to workers in this industry. There has been no reply so far. The workers are panicked and petitioned the Municipal Council for relief the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Rice Shop Association, limiting them to a specific reply before the 12th. Otherwise, the Rice Shop Association will be responsible for any accidents that occur. The authorities are paying close attention to whether there are any other circumstances involved.</p>

<h3>Provisional Municipal Council Will Meet Again Next Week to Study the Reports of Former Committees, a Decision Will Be Made on Utility Price Increases</h3>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the Provisional Municipal Council will hold its first regular meeting next Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. to study the reports of the former committees of the Bureau. In addition, at least three of the new committees of the Municipal Council are expected to meet next week. The most important of these is the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee, as it will decide whether to allow the various public utility companies to increase their prices. It is said that the four major public utility companies in the Public Concession have all applied to the Municipal Council for permission to increase their prices. The detailed content of the application is not yet known, but it is said that the bus and tram companies plan to double their fares. In their application to the Municipal Council, they stated that they would welcome any "substantial" increase that could be implemented. The other two companies that are expected to apply for fee increases are the water and electricity companies. It is not yet known how much they plan to increase their fees.</p>

<h3>More Than 100 Sampans in the Suzhou Creek Were Sunk by the Japanese Yesterday, More Than 700 People Were Immediately Displaced, Some Larger Vessels Were Confiscated for Their Own Use</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that there are many sampans and small boats moored in the Suzhou Creek near McKenna Road, densely packed together. The boat people live on the water and live a poor life. But this morning (the 10th), a number of Japanese naval marines went to the area, drove about 700 boat people ashore, and then scuttled the boats, causing them to sink. The boat people stood on the shore in the rain, watching their boats and belongings sink to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Attacked, Causing a Dispute</p>
<p>The incident stemmed from the fact that a Japanese sentry in the area was shot at a couple of weeks ago. Japanese troops, together with the Water Police Station, searched the small boats next to McKenna Road in order to arrest the murderer. It was said that two suspects were arrested at the time. After the Japanese soldiers finished searching, they scuttled the small boats one by one, regardless of right or wrong. It was found that on Sunday night, two Japanese sentries stationed in front of a certain bakery in the area were attacked. The murderers fired from a sampan boat in the Suzhou Creek, and then tried to land ashore, fleeing into the Public Concession and being captured.</p>
<p>Holes Drilled in the Bottom of the Boat, Allowed to Sink</p>
<p>The method of destruction used by the Japanese soldiers this morning was quite simple, that is, they drove all the bewildered boat people ashore, searched the boats, drilled holes in the bottom of the boats, and allowed the water to enter and sink the boats. The boat people had no choice but to take the reeds from the boats and build sheds along the shore to avoid the wind and rain. The reporter arrived at the area to investigate and saw a very tragic scene. At that time, the boat people were cooking lunch on the spot. Some of the belongings on the boats had been taken out and scattered on the ground in a mess. Some boat people were still wading knee-deep in the muddy water, retrieving useful items from the sinking boats.</p>
<p>Larger Vessels Have Been Confiscated</p>
<p>The purpose of this move by the Japanese soldiers is to clear the small boats in the Suzhou Creek to prevent Japanese sentries in the area from being shot at again by people hiding in the boats. More than 100 boats were scuttled. It is said that some larger vessels were confiscated by the Japanese soldiers for their own use. At that time, there were many bystanders on the shore. US Marines and Public Concession police arrived at the scene to disperse the idlers. Before long, the US soldiers left, leaving the Western police at the scene to maintain order.</p>
<p>Serious Steps After the Blockade</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities have not made any comments on the scuttling of the boats today. It is generally believed that this is the most serious step taken by the Japanese side since the blockade of Yu Yuan Road from November 26th to December 18th last year. It is said that the Public Concession Police Department also intends to clear the boats in the McKenna Road area and prohibit them from mooring there for a long time. It is also rumored that after the Japanese sentry was shot on Sunday, more than 1,000 boat people in the area were taken to the Japanese military headquarters for questioning.</p>
<h3>Silver and Coin Industry Consumer Cooperative Seeks Exercise Awards</h3>
<p>The Consumer Cooperative organized by the silver and coin industry colleagues in this city was established in May of the 28th year of the Republic of China and has now been in operation for two years. It has 3,000 members, its business is flourishing, and it is deeply appreciated by those in the industry. It is learned that the fourth round of recruitment of new shareholders has ended. Therefore, from today (the 11th) to the 18th, a welcome sale for new shareholders will be held for eight days to promote the interest of new shareholders in the cooperative business. A small exercise award ceremony is scheduled to be held this morning, and the president, Mr. Zhou Desun, will personally present the awards. All shareholders and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about the cooperative business are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Seven Ships Detained in Zhoushan</h3>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, foreign ships sailing between Shanghai and Zhejiang were detained by Japanese warships in the waters off Zhoushan. It has been several months, and they have not been released. According to the shipping industry yesterday, the number of ships detained in Zhoushan has now increased to seven. Several months ago, the ships that sailed from various ports in Zhejiang to Shanghai and were detained were the "Moufu," "Changde," "Jiangsu," "Anmanli," and "Aweimali." With this increase to seven, the other two ships should be newly arrived. However, the names of these two ships are not yet known. It is speculated that they may be the "Minhe" of the Portuguese merchants and the "Datong" of the British merchants, which were left at the Oujiang pier. It is likely that these two ships had not yet set sail when the war broke out, or they had to sail there afterwards. Although the various shipping companies have petitioned the consulate to negotiate for the release of the ships, the Japanese side has not responded, resulting in a standstill. In Wenzhou, although Ouhai has officially resumed operations, shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou cannot be resumed temporarily. The resumption of the "Shunli" wheel on the Shanghai-Ningbo line is purely speculative business and is unreliable. It is now heard that China, Huazhong, and Dongya are competing for the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is also learned that the "Deping" wheel of the Zhongyi Company (which previously operated on the Shanghai-Ningbo line) has recently been leased by the Japanese Yamashita Steamship Company, but its intention is unknown.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Discusses Japanese Newspaper's Views: Insufficient Understanding of China; If Japan Wants to Continue Stationing Troops in China, It Cannot Eliminate the Cause of Friction</h3>
<p>The semi-official "Japan Times" and "Guangzhi Bao" advocated seeking peace with China in their editorials on the 9th. The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" commented on this yesterday, saying that the Japanese are "the greatest artists" in the world, and that their contributions have created a new era.</p>
<p>Insufficient Understanding of China by Japan</p>
<p>When the newspaper generally discussed the Sino-Japanese War, it stated that Japan could not conquer China by force and advocated resolving the incident peacefully. However, the only ceasefire method suggested by the newspaper was to allow Japan to continue stationing troops in China. We believe that if this method can contribute to peace, we are willing to provide free meals to anyone after peace arrives. Although the newspaper has a correct understanding, it lacks a correct solution.</p>
<p>No Withdrawal, No Solution</p>
<p>The newspaper stated that there are two ways to resolve the war: one is to eliminate the cause of friction, and the other is to establish an environment sufficient to guarantee an orderly life. However, the fact that Japanese troops can continue to stay in China is sufficient to prolong the war and increase friction. Today, it is Japan, not China, that is seeking peace. China will not make peace until all Japanese troops have withdrawn.</p>
<p>Refusing to Treat the Disease Leads to Failure</p>
<p>The more Japan needs peace, the only way is to make peace with Chongqing, but the Japanese are reluctant to say it. This is the reason why Japan has failed and cannot announce it to its own country. The actions of the Japanese army in China over the past four years are well documented. Therefore, Japan cannot now make Chongqing trust its promise to withdraw its troops and respect China's sovereignty.</p>
<p>China Determined to Continue Fighting</p>
<p>At a time when the international environment is improving, allowing China to fully believe in its great future, China is unlikely to engage in any peace negotiations. The long-term war of four years has shown that China can be self-reliant. Therefore, the wave of peace painted by Japanese artists cannot stop China from fighting. Although Japan is eager for peace, peace cannot be promoted by Japan's wishes, and the right to propose peace terms lies in China, not Japan.</p>
<h3>Judge Yu Shuwei Kidnapped and Missing</h3>
<p>After Ms. Zhou Jingcai, a female clerk of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu, was kidnapped last Thursday, it was rumored that she had been released. Now, a similar incident has occurred. Yu Shuwei, a native of Changshu and former clerk of the Anhui Higher Court, is the nephew of Yu Chengxiu, a former judge of the Civil Court of the First Special Court and now a lawyer. Since the fall of Anhui Province, he was ordered by the Ministry of Justice to be assigned to the First Special Court and was assigned to work in the Criminal Court, where he was assigned to the Criminal Court judge to hold court once a week. His home is located somewhere on a road built beyond the boundary. Following Zhou Jingcai, he was also kidnapped, and there has been no news of him so far.</p>
<h3>Leadership Visits the New Chairman of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>At 10:30 a.m. on the 9th of this month, Consul General Hill formally visited Mr. Liddell, the new Chairman of the Public Works Department. Also, Rear Admiral Hiraoka Taichi, the commander of the Japanese Navy's Shanghai base, visited the Chairman of the Public Works Department yesterday (the 10th) morning.</p>
<h3>Miller Transportation Labor Dispute: Workers Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>Prolonged Business Labor Dispute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Press Staff Association has been on a hunger strike since the 23rd of last month. The company has suspended business and has been closed for nearly two weeks. During this long period, although various parties have mediated and the head office has sent special commissioners to Shanghai to handle the matter, no progress has been made. The labor and management sides are still deadlocked. After Mr. Li Bojia, the representative of the management, came to Shanghai, he once talked with the labor side, but did not continue negotiations afterwards. In order to break the deadlock, the labor side specially convened a meeting of the entire executive and supervisory committee yesterday.</p>
<p>Color Printing Labor Dispute Mediation</p>
<p>More than a thousand workers in the color printing industry in this city suddenly went on strike at 10:00 a.m. two days ago (the 9th). No specific conditions were put forward in advance, only a request to improve treatment. It is learned that this matter is being mediated by the Color Printing Industry Association.</p>
<p>Washing and Dyeing Labor-Management Negotiations</p>
<p>After repeated concessions in the strike of more than 3,000 washing and ironing workers in the Western-style washing and dyeing industry, the labor side resumed work in the morning of the day before yesterday. The labor and management sides held preliminary negotiations yesterday afternoon, but failed to reach an agreement due to the excessive demands made by the labor side. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold another round of negotiations this afternoon. It is expected that a satisfactory solution can be reached after today's negotiations.</p>
<p>Miller Workers Clash</p>
<p>All the drivers and workers of the Miller Automobile Transportation Company at No. 106 Beijing Road jointly submitted requests to the management on the 19th of last month, requesting an increase in wages and living allowances. The management refused, and the labor side announced a strike on the morning of the 29th. Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, all the striking workers clashed with the company authorities on the Taopeng Road when they hired replacement workers to load and transport goods from the British-American Tobacco Company. Six workers were injured on the spot. It is learned that the Political Department of the Public Concession, in view of the deadlock in the labor dispute and fearing that it would cause unexpected incidents, has been working hard to mediate between the two sides in the past two days. It is expected that a satisfactory solution can be reached in the short term.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Saves Birthday Feast Expenses and Donates One Day of Gruel</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Cilian Temporary Gruel Factory on North Zhejiang Road has been providing food to thousands of people every day, benefiting the poor in no small measure. Yesterday, Mr. Wang specially saved 500 yuan in national currency from his birthday feast expenses to donate to the factory for one day of gruel.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Season Has Arrived</h3>
<p>The hurricane season has arrived this year. The Harbor Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs will start reporting hurricane trends from today onwards to facilitate safe navigation and ensure the safety of import and export ships.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Service Restored in Yongjia and Eight Other Places</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the Shanghai Datong Dabeit Telegraph Bureau said that telegraph service in Yongjia, Huangyan, Xinchang, Haimen, Ruian, Shengxian, Wenling, and Gu'aotou has been restored one after another. Only Ningbo, Fenghua, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Cixi, and other counties in the occupied areas have not yet been connected.</p>
<h3>Cold Dishes Prohibited from June 1st</h3>
<p>Yiyou Society Injects Vaccine</p>
<p>It is summer, the season when epidemics are most easily transmitted. Therefore, the health authorities of the two concessions are actively promoting epidemic prevention movements and providing free vaccinations to citizens in order to reduce disease and death. In order to prevent epidemics before they occur, the Yiyou Society in this city has formulated prevention measures by the Health Section of the Welfare Committee and sent them to all sectors: (1) Those who want to be vaccinated can send a letter to inform the number of people, address, and time so that staff can be sent to carry out the vaccination; (2) Those who go to the Society for vaccination must do so between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and must make an appointment in advance to avoid crowding. Vaccination is free of charge. The permit issued after vaccination can be exchanged for a certificate of vaccination from the Health Department of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Banning Summer Cold Dishes</p>
<p>The Health Department of the Public Works Department believes that due to the concentration of population in Shanghai after the war, the number of patients with infectious diseases has also increased proportionally. From June 1st to September 30th, any dishes served at banquets must be cooked. Violators will be punished according to regulations. The Wine and Dish Industry Association has also decided to hold a meeting before the deadline to discuss supervision methods.</p>
<h3>Calling Someone from the Balcony, Lost Footing and Fell to Death</h3>
<p>Woman Li Zhou Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Li Zhou, a woman from Guizhou, is 40 years old. Her husband is doing business outside. Ms. Li and her seven-year-old son, Maomao, and her daughter, Li Yun (20 years old), rented a room on the third floor of No. 70 Qumen Lane, Ximen Road, and lived a very hard life. Ms. Li's younger sister, Yang Zhou, is 31 years old and lives at No. 71 毘. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, Yang Zhou came to Li Zhou's place to talk about something and left after a while. Li Zhou's son, Maomao, wanted to go back with his aunt Yang Zhou to play, but Yang Zhou had already gone out. Li Zhou could not bear to disobey her beloved son, so she rushed to the rooftop terrace and leaned against the railing to call Yang Zhou. Unexpectedly, because Li Zhou was tall and burly, she leaned her upper body down to call someone, and she lost her balance and fell headfirst from the railing to the cement floor. Her head was broken, and her brain was injured. She fainted immediately. After being discovered, an ambulance was called and sent to Guangci Hospital. It was too late to save her, and she died. The hospital reported to the police station, and detectives were dispatched to investigate. The body was sent to the mortuary and will be examined tomorrow before being collected by her family.</p>
<h3>Bandit Zhang Acai Commits Major Robbery</h3>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Old Zha Police Station recently arrested a bandit named Zhang Acai from Ningbo. He confessed to committing (1) a robbery on September 11th last year at 1:30 p.m. in Room 429 of the Securities Building at No. 429 Jiujiang Road, stealing gold bars and Japanese currency worth more than 257,000 yuan from Defu Silver Company; (2) a robbery on April 27th last year at the home of Lu Zhangliang at No. 118 Taiping Lane, Meibai Road, stealing property worth 5,886 yuan; (3) a robbery on August 3rd last year at the home of Ling Defu at No. 13, Lane 344, Baike Road, stealing property worth 1,994 yuan. This case was brought up by Judge Xiao Xiebin of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a charge of robbery and stated that the defendant confessed to the crime in the police station. When Zhang Acai was questioned, he suddenly completely recanted his confession and denied the robbery. After Judge Xiao questioned the victims, he ordered that he be detained for another interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>At around 8:00 p.m. last night, two robbers came to No. 194 Baike Road in the Public Concession. One drew a pistol, and the other held a sharp blade, prohibiting any noise. They robbed a gold ring and 60 yuan in cash. When they left with the loot, both robbers took a streetcar to escape. Unexpectedly, a member of the victim's family followed behind.</p>
<p>In Close Pursuit</p>
<p>Passing Baike Road to the entrance of the Jinmen Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, he saw Chinese policeman No. 246 stationed there. He immediately stepped forward to report, and the policeman chased after them. At this time, the two robbers on the streetcar had also received the news and abandoned the car to escape into the crowd. When the policeman saw the fleeing men, he knew they were not good people, so he</p>
<p>Opened Two Shots</p>
<p>Hitting one robber in the back on the spot, who fell to the ground with a thud, bleeding profusely. He died immediately. The other robber with the gun managed to escape. A portion of the original stolen goods was found near the body of the dead robber. The police then called an ambulance to</p>

<p>To Baolong Hospital, and then to the mortuary to await examination by the court. It is reported that the robber who was shot dead was named Wang Lansheng, about 30 years old, with two bullets in his back, neither of which penetrated. He was wearing a short shirt and was very ragged.</p>
<h3>Lone Robber Robs Pawnshop, Shot and Wounded by Detectives; Stolen Goods and Gun Found</h3>
<p>The back door of Yongkang Pawnshop at No. 255 Kaifeng Road is located in Xiexing Lane. At 6:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a robber in his twenties, wearing a blue striped suit, gray shorts, and running shoes, took advantage of the opportunity to pour out the chamber pot and broke into the room alone. Everyone was awakened from their sleep and threatened by a gun. He took out two pairs of handcuffs to prevent any noise and began to rob. After an hour, he robbed 1,000 yuan, a large bag of gold and silver jewelry worth thousands of yuan. As he was about to escape from the back door with the loot, he was reported to Chinese policeman No. 3236 stationed nearby. The patrol house immediately sent Western Detective Chief Kai Naidai, Chinese Detective Fang Qingyun, and Detectives Chen Guisen and Deng Shu, fully armed, to surround and arrest him. They fired at him, and the robber was hit by four bullets in the chest and legs, and fell to the ground behind the back door of the pawnshop, bleeding profusely. All the original stolen goods, a Mauser gun, four bullets, and two pairs of handcuffs were found on the spot. However, because the robber was seriously injured and unable to speak, he was sent to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. The seized items were taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Li Yunxiang of Xiesheng Silk Weaving Factory, our factory was set on fire by the neighboring Yumao Silk Weaving Factory at No. 14 on the 7th of this month, burning down seven houses, resulting in the tragic death of his wife, Ms. Lu, male worker Zhang Xianglin, female workers Zhang Guiying and Hu Fengying, and Ge Shiqi, the owner of Tingcheng Silk Factory, his wife, Ms. Zhou, his concubine, Ms. Zhao, and his son, Mingzhong. However, this morning's Shen Bao reported that the fire started at No. 13, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we entrust you to send a letter to the newspaper. Lawyer Zhou Yongquan, May 10, 30th year.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, saying that the mountains are sad, the sky is clear and cloudy with local fog, and there is a north wind. This area and the coastal area south of Ma'an Island are cloudy, foggy, turning cloudy, with gentle sad winds. Also, within 24 hours from 3:00 p.m. today, the temperature in this city will be 63.9 degrees high and 59.9 degrees low. On the same day last year, the highest was 64.4 and the lowest was 57.9.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Book Market</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>When I have nothing to do, I often like to go to the bookstores in the area of ​​Simmalu and Henan Road to take a stroll. At first, I didn’t want to buy any books. Looking at the colorful books on the bookshelves, I felt a little more comfortable in my heart. It's just like how I like to go to the park for a walk. Even if I found a book I loved in a book stall, looking at the price on the copyright page and touching my pocket, I couldn't help but blush because of my poverty. The price of everything is rising sharply, and the price of books is also rising. Although there are many people standing by the book stalls flipping through books, very few people actually pay for the books and take them home. Therefore, I think the business of booksellers must be quite miserable!</p>
<p>The prices of rice, coal, and everything else are rising wildly with the revolutionary bottom of May. The printing industry is also afraid of falling behind and raising prices accordingly. The price for each thousand characters of typesetting is three yuan and seven cents (additional charges for side dots and personal name lines). The price for each ream of printing is ten yuan upon export. The price of binding has increased by 120%. In addition to the cost of paper, etc., how much does it cost to print a book? Adding the bookstore's rent, electricity, staff salaries, and other expenses, as well as the interest and profits that should be earned, I'm afraid that even a thin book of 100 pages would not make any money if it were sold for two yuan at current prices. Hunger is a major issue, and food is essential. Although the spiritual food of books is important, it can still be managed. It is not necessary to buy it unless it is needed. Therefore, I think the fate of booksellers is something that profiteers who hoard rice and coal cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Despite such difficult material conditions, the various types of books in bookstores are still being published continuously. What kind of tutorials, readers, literary societies, publishing houses... are still producing and publishing in large quantities. I really admire their courage, and at the same time I can't help but wonder if these books will sell well. Moreover, the content of these books is also worth examining. There are indeed many that are pure in thought and accurate in argument, but how many are crudely made and deceive readers? There are also many periodicals with childish and empty content, and I can't help but say that they are simply a waste!</p>
<p>There is also a type of book in bookstores that seems to be attracting attention recently. That is, after importing "How to Be a Leader," "How to Train Yourself," and "Education for Living" from the utilitarian United States, Chinese publishing houses have massively imitated and produced them, all in the role of teachers, guiding and teaching young people. I am really surprised why Chinese writers like to teach young people in this way, as if young people cannot be saved without reading these books. I also doubt that Chinese young people would really be so willing to accept other people's "lessons." I once saw a letter from a young man to an author saying: "You said that the solution is next to you, as long as you pay attention to find it, it is not difficult to find. But I looked and looked and still couldn't find it. Please tell me where is the solution?" (The general idea is like this, I can't remember the original sentence.) This sentence is humorous enough to represent the feelings of young people after reading these "teaching" books.</p>
<p>In terms of translation, there are several books worth mentioning. These are Fu Donghua's translation of "Gone with the Wind" (also known as "Gone with the Wind"), Lin Yutang's two English works "The Art of Living" and "Moment in Peking" (some translate it as "Peking Smoke and Clouds"), and the translation of Evelyn Waugh's "Scoop". They have all been published one after another. Especially Fu Donghua's translation of "Gone with the Wind," a huge book of more than one million words, the translator declared that he would no longer translate books after translating "Don Quixote," but finally broke the rule and completed this masterpiece. I also spent 5 yuan of legal tender to buy this "masterpiece". My motivation for buying this masterpiece can be divided into three points: (1) It was a bestseller in the United States last year and caused a sensation in the reading circles of various countries; (2) The film adapted from this masterpiece was shown in the Shanghai Renhua Theater for a long time; (3) It was translated by Fu Donghua; for this reason, I bought it despite the pain. But I haven't finished reading it yet. I don't know if it's because I don't know how to read books, or because the story of the Civil War makes me tired? Or both reasons? But I do not deny that this book aroused my bad impression: (1) The vulgar adjectives in the conversations between Brett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara; (2) Some place names in the United States already have long-standing translations in our country, but they are translated in strange and peculiar ways in this book; I suspect that this book may not have been translated by Fu Donghua, or there may be other reasons that I, with my limited knowledge, do not know. Furthermore, I don't really like this translation.</p>
<p>I discovered a hardcover four-volume collection of all the lecture notes from the former Shen Bao Correspondence School of Journalism in the "American Bookstore". When I asked about the price, it was 60 yuan. After investigation, it was found that many of the original lecture notes were lost, and they were reprinted and supplemented to make it perfect. However, there are only ten copies in total, which can be said to be out of print. This newspaper originally wanted to preserve all the lecture notes. A colleague, with the consent of the museum, invested in reprinting and matching them so that they could be circulated. It should be a very valuable new collection of learning!</p>
<p>The price of old books in the street book stalls has also soared with the price of various goods. The reading community has been severely hit. In bookstores, there are only many people flipping through books, and only one out of ten are really buying books. Under these circumstances, the old book stalls on the street have emerged in response, and they are indeed economical book markets. Therefore, the real customers of bookstores are going to the old book stalls. (Photo by Kang Zuyi)</p>

<h3>Famous People Who Grew Up in Poverty</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>——As long as you have ambition, don't be afraid of humble origins——</p>
<p>If a person has ambition and is willing to work hard, one day he will achieve his goal. Maybe he will become a famous person and be known all over the world. In the world, there are many famous people who have very humble origins and have lived in poverty since childhood. As a result, through continuous struggle, they have established great careers or made great contributions to mankind!</p>
<p>Speaking of politicians: Former US President Hoover and current Prime Minister Mussolini's fathers were poor blacksmiths; Soviet leader Stalin's father was a shoemaker, German leader Hitler was a poor orphan when he was a child, and worked as a garbage porter when he was a teenager; Our national father Sun Yat-sen, Czech President Benes, and French President Lebrun were all from peasant families. Speaking of writers: British writer Shaw worked in London as a store clerk copying invoices and keeping accounts; Soviet "giant of an era" Gorky worked as an apprentice in a mounting shop, a shop assistant in a shoe store, a gardener, a cook, and a peddler selling icons and bread; Norwegian novelist Hamsun worked as a road worker and streetcar driver. Speaking of entrepreneurs: American oil tycoon Rockefeller worked as a clerk; Automobile King Henry Ford entered a machine factory as an apprentice at the age of seventeen. Others include French general Joffre, whose father was a cooper; American inventor Edison worked as a railway worker and news vendor at the age of twelve, and did not even have food to eat at the age of twenty-one on the streets of New York. But what about their achievements?</p>
<p>Children, most of your current circumstances are better than those famous people were when they were young. If you don't work hard, wouldn't you be ashamed? Therefore, in this world, a person is not afraid of poverty or humble origins, but only of not being able to endure!</p>
<h3>The Spirit of "Starting and Finishing Well" is Needed in Doing Things</h3>
<p>— Kang</p>
<p>Little friends! Whatever we do, we should set a purpose and identify a goal to work towards. Don't be fickle and indecisive. In the end, we won't be able to accomplish anything. This is the most undesirable thing. Especially for you, little friends, who are the future pillars of the country and the cornerstones of society, this kind of habit is even more unacceptable. Otherwise, you will definitely not be able to achieve great things in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read an English book and saw an article called "Ten Footprints." This article can serve as an example for us, so I specifically translated and wrote it down below:</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there were two Native American Indians. One was named Hazida, a magical archer, strong and agile. The other was named Quetong, a weaker archer with a very weak bow. However, he was very persevering and patient. They went hunting together.</p>
<p>When they passed a small hill, they saw the footprints of a young deer that had recently passed by on the ground. Quetong wanted to follow the footprints to chase the deer. However, Hazida said, "You go ahead and chase it! A strong hunter like me wants to catch bigger game."</p>
<p>So, they went their separate ways to find their own prey!</p>
<p>Hazida walked for more than an hour and found ten pairs of large elk footprints running in various directions. He chose the largest footprint and followed it. He chased it for a long time, but couldn't catch up. Then he thought about chasing another one.</p>
<p>So, he returned to the place where he first saw the ten footprints and followed another elk footprint to chase it. After an hour, he still couldn't catch it. So, he followed another footprint to chase another one. He said, "I must catch it for food." However, after chasing it for a while, he gave up again and went to catch another one that he thought had a good chance of catching. Like this, he spent a whole day, searching one by one according to the ten footprints, but in the end, he gained nothing.</p>
<p>However, Quetong's insight was higher than Hazida's, and he also had a stronger patience. So, he closely followed the footprints of the young deer that he had initially seen and chased it, and in the end, he caught the deer.</p>
<p>The lesson this story teaches us is that we must be focused and consistent in doing things, and we must finish what we start. We must never be indecisive, like Hazida, who was busy all day but couldn't catch any wild animals, and wasted precious time in vain.</p>
<p>Little friends, is this worthwhile?</p>
<h3>Plant Toys</h3>
<p>— Shepherd Boy</p>
<p>――Soybean Monkey――</p>
<p>Little friends, when you see this topic, you must ask me: "Soybeans can only be eaten, how can they be made into monkeys?" However, I am not lying. It can indeed be made into a monkey. Next, I will tell you how to make it, but first, please think about how to do it. Perhaps what you think of is much better than what we say.</p>
<p>Now, I assume you have already thought about it. I have to tell you my method to see if it is the same as what you thought. The materials for making a monkey, in addition to four soybeans, also include three short bamboo skewers and one long bamboo skewer; however, these soybeans must be newly picked from the garden. (Why?)</p>
<p>Let's talk about the monkey's head first! Peel off the top half of the skin of one soybean, leaving the bottom half of the skin. After you peel off the skin, you will definitely find a small bud tip; ah, isn't that the monkey's nose? So, at this time, you can know what the remaining skin is for. It's just like the monkey wearing a hat.</p>
<p>Next, we need to talk about the monkey's waist, but we can know that the waist is simple, just replace it with a soybean.</p>
<p>What we need to talk about are the monkey's hands and feet. Don't we still have two soybeans left? This is the solution. Please peel off the skin of the soybeans, and then please peel off a small part of the inside of each soybean, wouldn't it look very much like curved hands and feet?</p>
<p>All parts of the monkey are made. We only need to use bamboo skewers to connect the monkey's head and waist. A small bamboo skewer connects the monkey's back and hands, and another small bamboo skewer connects the monkey's waist and feet. The remaining long bamboo skewer is useless; just insert it into the monkey's butt! At this time, you can lift the monkey up and play with it.</p>
<h3>Science and Superstition</h3>
<p>— Yangchun Green</p>
<p>In the past, people's knowledge was naive, and they thought that all things in nature were governed by gods. Mountains had mountain gods, water had water gods, fire had fire gods, wind had wind gods, and even old trees had tree gods. Later, after scientists' detailed observations and precise experiments, this superstition was broken.</p>
<p>Summer thunderstorms aroused people's doubts. Some people said, "The Thunder God Bodhisattva has come out, the Lightning Goddess has appeared." Others said, "The Bodhisattva in the sky is drumming." It wasn't until the 18th century that the American Benjamin Franklin used a kite to attract electricity from the air, thus proving the phenomenon of discharge in the air. This mysterious curtain was then unveiled.</p>
<p>The phenomena of solar and lunar eclipses also had many hypotheses in ancient times. Some said, "It was swallowed by the heavenly dog." Others said, "It was eaten by the wild sun and wild moon." Therefore, when encountering a solar or lunar eclipse, people often made many unconscious actions. Some burned incense and kowtowed, and some beat gongs and drums. Since scientists discovered the principles of celestial body movement, this superstition has also been broken.</p>
<p>Science is not empty, it uses methods to seek truth in everything. Therefore, once superstition encounters science, it will collapse without being attacked. However, there are still superstitious people. We, the little friends with scientific minds, should not follow the superstitions of ordinary people about all new and strange things, thinking that there are gods and ghosts. We should know how to use careful observation and experiments to obtain accurate knowledge.</p>
<h3>Good Ways to Save Paper</h3>
<p>— Kun</p>
<p>Little friends, in this era of expensive goods, you must be very willing to help your parents save as much as possible. Here I will tell you a way to save paper (isn't it the same as saving money?):</p>
<p>You must have, and have a lot of, old notebooks and composition books, right? Well, you can remove the binding of them, turn them over page by page (the front side becomes the back side), and then bind them together again. You can use them as scratch paper or other purposes; you can write with a pencil or ink pen. In addition, arithmetic books can also be used to write in the empty spaces.</p>
<p>These are all good ways to save money; little friends, you might as well try it, and show the notebooks you have made to your parents, and you will definitely get their praise.</p>
<h3>Two Fish</h3>
<p>— Duanfang</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there were three happy fish living in a small pond. One of the fish used its wisdom at all times, another fish would improvise when necessary, and the third fish never used its brain at all.</p>
<p>One day, two fishermen walked by the pond. They saw three fish swimming back and forth in the clear water.</p>
<p>"Quick, let's go get the net!"</p>
<p>The first fish, which always used its wisdom, heard the fisherman's words and quickly escaped.</p>
<p>After a while, the fishermen came back with the net, first blocking the exit of the pond to prevent the remaining two fish from escaping, and then put the net into the water.</p>
<p>At this time, the second fish began to panic, but soon it floated on the surface of the water and pretended to be dead. The fishermen were finally deceived.</p>
<p>As a result, the fish that didn't use its brain was caught, and the fishermen had a big meal for dinner.</p>
<p>Later, the fishermen became suspicious of the fish that pretended to be dead. They encountered it again a few months later, but were no longer deceived by it, so the result was also very tragic!</p>
<p>Little friends! Are you using your wisdom at all times?</p>
<h3>The Spirit of All Things</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>The phrase "Man is the spirit of all things" was constantly swirling in Ah Hui's mind because this phrase was often uttered by the teachers in class, and his father sometimes said this to him as well, but he didn't quite understand why man is the spirit of all things? Other animals are not qualified, what is the reason for this? He asked his brother Ah Ming about this question. But Ah Ming didn't have a definite answer either. Later, he waited for a good opportunity to ask his father. "The phrase "Man is the spirit of all things" is not wrong at all. All things refer to all the animals and plants in the world, and man is also a kind of animal, but man's intelligence is much superior to all things. In other words, no creature in the world is as spiritual as man. Therefore, man's position in nature is the highest, and no matter what they want, they can eventually get it. For example, if he wants to catch a bird, he uses various methods to obtain it, such as shooting with a gun, catching with a net, and other clever methods to achieve the goal. This is something other animals cannot do. So why is it only man who has spirituality? This is because man has thoughts, is willing to work hard, can endure hardship, and is willing to persevere. Moreover, man's brain is more developed than other animals, so his thinking is very sensitive, and he has obtained the "real seat" of the spirit of all things. As for what thinking is, there is a layer of protein substance covering the upper part of the human brain, containing nerve cells, about one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch thick. This protein substance is what manages thoughts. If the protein substance is richer, the thinking will be more developed. Man's protein substance grows on the outer lip of the brain, so it can grow and develop, which can make thinking particularly advanced. Ordinary animals also have protein substances, but they only have a thin lip, and they grow on the inside of the brain, so they are not easy to grow and develop, and thinking is also difficult to be sensitive. How does thinking happen? If there is a kind of message, the tiny nerves that are all over the human body will function, circulating through the nerve cells of the protein substance in the brain, and then thinking will occur. For example, if your eyes are focused on these words on this page, then these words will be quickly transmitted to your brain through your optic nerve, and at the same time circulate through the cells in various parts of the brain, and the cells in various parts of the brain will exchange and transmit information about these words to each other. Later, if the message of these words circulates through your brain cells again, you will have the thought of these words, or recall them, or even extend these words and lead to some new meanings. The speed of nerve transmission of messages is usually about 404 feet per second. If a finger is burned or painful, this message takes about one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth of a second to travel from the fingertip to the brain. And other animals can only transmit messages at 90 feet per second. A person who thinks a lot also consumes a little energy, but the amount is very small, less than one percent of the amount consumed by arm strength. Because thinking requires energy consumption, the brain also needs food, which is blood, so there are countless blood vessels in the brain, and a lot of fresh blood is constantly flowing in the blood vessels to supply the needs of nerve cells. Ah Hui's father talked endlessly like this, which made Ah Hui suddenly understand.</p>

<h3>Will Diana Durbin Abandon Her Movie Life?</h3>
<p>— Huilin</p>
<p>Now all of Hollywood is watching and concerned about the future of Diana Durbin. People have raised many inevitable questions for her: will she end her movie life after marrying Vincent Frick? Or will she gain greater success due to her marriage?</p>
<p>Undeniably, Diana can be considered the luckiest girl in the world. She has a beautiful appearance, she has a clever mind, and she has a gifted singing voice, which has given her fame and status in the film industry. She stepped into the film industry in 1936, and has since starred in eight films, such as "Three Smart Girls," "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "Mad About Music," "That Certain Age," "First Love," and "It Started with Eve." Every time a film is released, the box office is always unprecedented, and people never tire of watching it. Therefore, Diana has also become the pillar star of Universal Pictures. In the company's budget, the income from Diana's films is also listed. The repeated screenings of the eight films have made the company a lot of money. Diana's unprecedented popularity in film history is very rare. Therefore, the company is also preparing to give her two last films in the short term, one is "Nice Girl?" and the other is "Ready for Romance"; because the company cannot decide whether she will return to the screen after marriage, why not shoot more films for her now and earn more money?</p>
<p>Diana Durbin is very fond of children and is now also practicing housework. She pays close attention to issues such as home decoration and design; it seems that she is not prepared to live a movie life again, but according to Hollywood's general observations, she will not shoot movies again for at least a short period of time, and she is not prepared to change her style even after returning to the screen. If Diana plays a charming role, no one will appreciate her acting skills.</p>
<p>In short, it still depends on Diana's own answer and her future box office situation.</p>
<h3>Fang Peilin Prepares to Shoot Social Film</h3>
<p>Minggu</p>
<p>When mentioning "Brother Fang," everyone should know that he is Fang Peilin, the director of "Silver Gun Bandit" of the United Film Company. When he first entered the film industry, he was responsible for scenery work, and successively served in Zhongnan, Xinming, and Great China Lily Companies. It was not until he entered Yihua Company that he gained critical acclaim for the scenery of the film "Woman," and then he jumped to become a director, and the first film he completed was "Avatar Girl."</p>
<p>After the war, he joined the Xinhua lineup and filmed "Thunderstorm," "Wu Zetian," and "Yanmen Pass" and other films, which were well-received. Now, he is filming "Silver Gun Bandit" starring Zhang Huichong, with Zhang Huichong's reputation in "Heroes of the Water" ten years ago, his return to the film industry this time, meeting with people in the film industry after a long time, it is expected that it will cause a stir among people inside and outside the film circle.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter met Fang Peilin and talked about the filming situation of "Silver Gun Bandit." The work is extremely tense. Currently, the scenes of Zhang Huichong are being filmed first, and the scenes of the heroine Long Qiuxia have not yet started. By the end of this month, all of Zhang Huichong's performances can be rushed to completion, because Zhang Huichong will start performing magic at the Lyceum Theatre or the Great Shanghai Theatre next month.</p>
<p>Probably in the middle of next month, "Silver Gun Bandit" may be completed. After the completion of this film, "Brother Fang" talked about a film he is preparing to shoot, a social film. In the midst of the rise of fashion films, he feels that social films cannot be ignored. The script of the social film is being rushed to be written, and the title has been decided as "Hundred Tribulations Rose," which purely reflects the current society, satirizes the current society, and adopts the same approach as the film "Black Paradise."</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in Qiong Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Falling Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>Just now, when I walked back to my room, the moonlight was very bright, and I could see everything clearly. Suddenly, I saw Sang Yiqing wearing short clothes and slippers, tiptoeing from the inner room towards his own room, gently closing the door, as if he was a thief. How could Xu Jing not understand in his heart? Knowing that today is the sixteenth, Wang Yongtai is observing the precepts and sleeping in the outer room, not entering He Ji's room, it is clear that the adulterer and adulteress are taking advantage of the opportunity to have fun. It's ridiculous that He Ji, already having an affair with her cousin, still holds the heart of wanting more, and insists on seducing himself. She treats the world as black as crows, but she doesn't know that I, Xu Jing, am an upright man. How could I do such a beastly act? Alas! This is tolerable, what is not tolerable? I want to take the opportunity to advise Wang Yongtai to be careful and drive that fellow out, that is the right thing to do. Now that I know this, how can I always learn from the Jin people to keep my mouth shut? Having made up his mind, he went back to his room and rested. The next day, he went to the yamen, and it happened that Zhou Yuji was reviewing the troops outside the city and practicing field battles. He also followed the crowd out of the city to practice, the military appearance was very grand, and he was secretly happy in his heart when he saw it. Because at that time, Li Zicheng had already broken Tongguan, and the rumors were getting tighter and tighter. Zhou Yuji ordered the city defense to be extra strict to prevent the invasion of the bandits, so there was this military review. In the afternoon, when he returned to his room, he saw a maidservant from He Ji's side tidying up the desk in his room, which was filled with some dry pastries. Seeing Xu Jing come back, she told Xu Jing that this was a gift from Madam Ru to the young master. Xu Jing had no choice but to thank her and accept it. After the maidservant finished tidying up, she left. Xu Jing thought to himself, He Ji rejected me severely, but she doesn't hate me and sends me food? It seems that her heart for me is not completely cold, I must be even more careful. When it was time to sleep at night, he found a fragrant handkerchief on the pillow, embroidered with a pair of butterflies flying together, the fragrance was fragrant, it was clearly something from He Ji's side, how did it get to my bed? Thinking of the maidservant who tidied up his pillows and bedding during the day, it must have been that maidservant who secretly put it under my pillow. What is the purpose of this? Although it is said that He Ji's infatuation is immortal, she deliberately sent me this handkerchief, a silkworm cocoon, and still wants to tempt me? Then I will have a hard time living here.

<h3>Sent to "Gonghua"</h3>
<p>— Tan Feng</p>
<p>—Written after seeing the public performance of "Thunderstorm"</p>
<p>I don't know you, but after seeing your fifth experimental performance this time, I want to say a few words to you all.</p>
<p>Generally speaking (not all), the actors did not grasp the personality: Lu Gui is an insidious and cunning villain, Chen Zhongjun seems to have not expressed this clearly enough. If I hadn't read the script, it would be difficult to tell from his appearance that he was a servant in the Zhou mansion. He didn't memorize the lines of the first act well. Because he was too familiar with them, he lacked pauses in the middle, and the tone was not varied enough, which made the audience feel plain and boring.</p>
<p>Zhou Ping's makeup seems a bit old. The person playing him, Ma Qujun, lacks real emotion, especially the lack of thought beforehand for the actions. The movement is too mechanical. Zhuang Huaqun's Shi Ping is not old enough, the movements are also too fast, and many of the words she read are not clearly and fluently uttered. Seeing the scene of Park Yuan, there should be many opportunities to act, but she read it flatly.</p>
<p>Park Yuan's clothes are too new, and the snow-white collar is exposed outside the iron-blue long shirt, which is not the clothing that an old man who feels depressed about world affairs should have. Look: he is still hanging a string of Buddhist beads on his right hand, but because of it, Hai Yili's hand is always bent, like a wounded soldier hanging his hand in a gauze bandage, so his movements are a bit stiff. Mei Lian's makeup is too young. When she and Ping and Chong stand together, no one would believe it if you were to say that Chong'er is her biological child or that Ping'er is younger than her. We feel that she didn't go too far in playing Fan Yi, but not enough. Her smile is not very natural, but she played very well at the beginning of the fourth act.</p>
<p>I really feel sorry for Jiang Hong, who plays Si Feng. Although it is the first time I have seen her act, I think she is someone who knows how to act. Your effects are very good, and the thunderstorm is very realistic. For example, the furniture is too new and too "modern," not like the "eighteen-year-old appearance" that Park often says. The curtains and potted flowers are all in bright red, which is enough to affect the atmosphere of the tragedy. I have said so many critical words, the purpose is just to have an opportunity to discuss with you. However, are you "willing to shake hands with me?"</p>
<p>I wish you success next time.</p>
