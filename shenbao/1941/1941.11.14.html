<h3 id="c27">奎松氏連任菲總統 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>菲列賓共和邦連日舉行大選，據隔昨所發表的選舉結果，現任菲總統奎松氏，已以絕對之大多數，當選連任；同時依照憲法修正案新組織之菲律賓第一屆國曾，其參衆兩院議員，也已分別選出，以代替舊有之一院制的國民會議。除中國外，菲律賓是遠東方面唯一的民主國家。菲律賓雖遲至一九三五年，始根據所謂泰丁麥杜飛法案，獲得獨立建國；美國對菲的控制，雖猶須等到一九四六年，始能完全放棄；然而菲律賓政治地位之日益增髙，則彰然在人耳目，實在是遠東全局中甚可樂觀之一因素。奎松氏為非律賓之元老政治家，自一九三五年第一次當選總統以來，其施政積極而穩健，有決斷而開明，所以深得國民的欽敬和擁護，觀於此次奎氏的當選連任，得票之多，卽足以說明菲島現行政治局勢之鞏固。同時美國諸最髙行政當局，對奎松氏也都有深厚的交誼，所以奎氏的述任，對於美菲提携，亦將多所貢獻。</p>
<p>最近南太平洋大局，空前緊張，菲律賓的地位，更加受人重視。就法埋上說，在一九四六年七月以前，非律賓還是美國治權下的一地域；就實際利害而論，則目前菲律賓的國家安全，也像美國在太平洋區的一切權益和領土一樣，正受到外來的嚴重威脅。因此之故，美菲軍事合作，於勢必須加强。在美國的國防體系中，菲律賓本來是一個突出的前哨，不易防守，所以從前美國國會中的孤立分子，頗多高呼放棄菲島，以免捲入遠東漩渦。但這種呼聲，至今已全被羅斯福總統所　服，這固然由於羅氏的目光如炬，知道對侵略者不容退讓，且不願在危險中拋棄菲律賓，使之陷於孤立無援之境，同時也由於英美合作的强化，新加坡已成為英美之共同堡壘，亦卽菲律賓已獲得一鞏固之後方，為之支持。今年四月二日及十月三日，英國遠東軍總司令樸芳元帥，曾兩度飛抵菲律賓，會商英美菲之武裝聯防；同時美國也會同菲律賓政府，採取了兩項重要而切實之步驟，卽：　由美總統於七月二十六日下令，將菲律賓海陸軍兵員編入美國軍隊，並任命麥克沃塞將軍為美國遠東軍總司令，加以統率；　上月二十五日，美陸軍部更委派第一流之航空專家培爾頓少將為第一任美國遠東空軍司令，駐在馬尼拉，受麥克沃塞將軍之指揮。經此一番布置後，菲律賓的防務，已大形鞏固，而空軍力尤強，這對於遠東的軸心勢力，將為致命之打擊。現時菲律賓，香港，和新加坡所構成的三角形地帶，一面屛障荷印，澳洲，及印度之安全，一面則興夏威夷的美國海軍主力遙相呼應着。更據英相邱吉爾氏在本月十日宣布，英國可於需要時以力量强大之重海軍，附以必要的輔助軍艦，服役於印度洋及太平洋；昨日外電，且傳英艦隊已出動遠東。然則將來太平洋大戰必不可免時，因有英艦隊駛入南太平洋之故，美艦隊的活動及作戰範國，也許將偏於北太平洋。但卽使如此，而菲律賓依然是英美海空軍的重要聯絡站。加以南太平洋日本代管諸島與越南日根據地之交通錢，其間遭菲律賓之遮斷，這」點，對於將來阻北軸心潛艇的活動，尤將發生重要作用。</p>
<p>菲律賓在軍事上之重要性，已如上述。現在因為奎松總統當選連任之故，當更易發揮行政效率，增强對美合作，以應付未來之變局。而世人對於菲律賓局勢的觀察，除重視其軍事價値外，還留有一更深刻的印象，這就是，民主主義和國際間的眞誠合作精神，已在遠東獲得重大的發展，目前菲律賓政局的進步，卽其顯明之徵象。菲律賓本來是文化發達較遲的地域，當西班牙統治時代，更曾受到許多磨難。自從美西戰爭後，美國雖然獲有菲律賓的統治權，但並不奴役菲律賓的人民，而一意以發展菲島人文及促進其工商業之責任自負，在政治活動上也予以充分的自由，使能接受民主主義，並終於產生了菲律賓共和邦。這一切眞誠促進國際合作的程序，和軸心集團的政策與行動，正是一個相反的對比。所以現時美菲間的聯繫，與其謂係强迫性的，母寗說是一種自願性的互助。菲律賓的「試行獨立」，為期十年，現在已過了大半。觀於此次菲島大選進行之順利，卽可斷言其前途之光明。此時太平洋上，波濤萬丈，戰雲密布，菲律賓正與諸大民主國家，携手共進，也許在不久的將來，還要經過一段極艱苦的大奮　，纔能撲滅一切黑暗勢力。但以國際反侵略陣綫目標之正大，實力之堅强，參加合作的菲律賓，一定可以在總勝利中得更光榮之收穫。願乘奎松總統當選連任的機會，向此遠東的新興共和邦遙致其祝賀。</p>

<h3 id="c35">法國的政界女禍 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>這篇講釗法國政界的女　，譯自　國Ksquire雜　，法國敗壊至此的由來，可見一斑，不僅砲火中的　事也。</p>
<p>在戰敗之前。法國有兩個女人，一個生長在肥皂相堆　，一個與沙魚議為伍。她們難非宦室千金，却是實業界巨頭的嬌女，不獨家資富有，而且美說絕倫，因此自視甚高，懷抱　一種野心。兩人皆與貴族締婚，皆欲干預政治，影響　運，第一個是鮑爾特伯爵夫人，第二這一次存亡絕續的危難中，都扮演着重要角色，她們兩人的芳名，將在歷史上永垂不朽了。</p>
<p>一九二九年某日上午，雷布斐爾小姐，正在巴黎，她玉腿交又，昂首仰視。她是個褐色美人，身材並不甚高，而肌肉丰滿，櫻　半啓，瓠犀微露，一雙棕色的眸子，發出閃動人的異光。那時雷斐爾小姐，剛好打定主意要征服法國哩</p>
<p>她以前是多麼煩惱呀！日月蹉跎，光陰虛擲，又使她多麽着急呀！她的父親是馬賽附近幾家主要肥皂工廠的主人。她曾　業於最優良的鄉村學校，亦會受敎於親戚家中，其後與中產階級的幾個政治領袖相識，於是雄心勃發，亟思脫頴而出，厠身於貴族名媛之列。</p>
<p>海倫自恃年輕貌美，旣具迷人之姿色，後有丰富的妝奩，加以她人極聰明，善於操縱，一班可供　遣的人，遂無不拜到在石榴裙下。</p>
<p>她生非世家，而立意成為貴族。這是她第一個要克服的障碍。</p>
<p>她有女友弗爾伯爵夫人，幼為居蒙小姐，系出名門，後嫁一富有的代議士，在交際塲中，王孫公子，無不與之相識。這班靑年貴冑，多有家道中落，求凰未遂者，海倫請弗爾夫人為之居間介紹。</p>
<p>弗爾先把她引見克魯沙侯爵，他是著名貴婦杜才公爵夫人之孫。海倫與之輕憐密愛，將有婚約，不料偶與飽爾特侯爵特加達涅公爵夫人之子鮑爾特伯爵相値。海倫素懐公爵夫人的夢想，鮑爾特伯爵又有晋襲公爵的希望，於是一見傾心，遽訂白首。伯爵雖言談無味，而風度翩翩，見此聰明風流的少女，亦為之顚倒不止。</p>
<p>海倫旣婚，耶欲效法弗爾伯爵夫人，設一客廳，晋接一班政治，財政，外交及學界中的名人碩士，她想效尤巴黎社　中一班美人，做一個隱身慕後的牽綫人物。</p>
<p>什麽叫做客廳？二十年來，牠在法國的政治上很佔重要地位，所以頗有一提的價値。</p>
<p>有一等法國女人，以為「弱女子」在世界大戰中的成績，並不亞於男子，因此想在法國領導女參政運勤。可是她們不僅遭逢國會議員的義請，且受到大部份女性的冷淡和敵視。就大體說來，法國女子對於政治，一向是存着嫌惡和畏懼之心的。</p>
<p>可是她們雖不願厠身政治，却想藉着她們的姿色和聰明，在幕後操縱政治。</p>
<p>前法國總理薩勞會於接見婦女參政團時說道：「你們還要選舉權做什麽？　　之內，早已感受你們的影響了。</p>
<p>參政團是啞口無言了，可是龐巴都夫人，都琶莉夫人，孟德儂夫人，特斯泰夫人，大郡主，達利盎夫人？喬治小姐，華留斯基，貝爾，苔絲麗，和梅洛特等的閨秀遺風，是雖歷第三共和政府而不衰的。</p>
<p>女人固無實際的權力，但她們間接的影響，却還要大些</p>
<p>一九一四年以前，法國政府的此起彼仆，都決定於呂納夫人，杜莉安夫人，波蓋夫人，和賈亞梵夫人（安得烈夫人之母）的客廳之中。</p>
<p>一九一八年以後，又有許多婦人包圍着國際聯盟。年輕有志的女子如海倫鮑　特者，自想烈烈轟轟，步武她們光榮的遺跡了。</p>
<p>鮑爾特夫人交際廣闊，時常宴客，或出外應酬。她的父親與常時掌握政權的泰狄歐相議，她第一次宴客，就請他為首席貴賓。她把丈夫的表弟法西斯派火十字團首領賴洛克上校介紹給泰狄歐，後來却由泰氏告發賴洛克請求和收受秘密款項一事，此次會見，不免為賴洛克所後悔吧，飽爾特小姐又藉同學奧台德彭奈之力，把喬治彭奈引為她的座上客，奧合德彭奈，就是急進社會黨的開創者貝勒當之孫女。</p>
<p>此外，她自幼相識的塔布衣夫人，和　為坎特公爵夫人的希臘瑪麗娜羣主，都是當日的嘉賓。</p>
<p>她于賴伐爾，佛蘭亭，和特蒙齊，都很注意，可是她應當選擇那一個呢？</p>
<p>她躇躇莫決了好久。她雖藉泰狄歐興萊諾相識，當時却並不屬意於他。後來在一九三一年時，皮倍斯哥郡主請她與萊諾同宴，私下對她說。「據廖戴上將吿訴我，此人前程速大，日　定能　黄滕達」，</p>
<p>自此以後，海倫方開始注意這位政治家，又見萊諾對她十分愛慕芳心便漸漸傾向他了</p>
<p>當時萊諾方初露頭角。他人很瘦小，帶有一點神經質，而談吐極佳。他的父親生於南阿爾卑斯，後在墨西哥致富。萊諾不　任何黨派，思想淸晰，吐屬不凡，因此知名於時。，</p>
<p>他先與法國酒吧問公會主席勞培的女兒亨利小姐結婚，產一女名柯萊脫，其後忽吿仳離。</p>
<p>萊諾在歐戰中頗著切續，故戰爭結束以後，即當選為議員，一九二四年雖選舉失敗，但不久又被　為巴黎第二匪的代　士。他在衆議院中　於德國的幾次演說，使他聲譽雀起，廁身於全國、演說家之列。</p>
<p>一九三○年時，萊諾因在六個月前預言美國的財政恐慌，及後其言果騐，因此得長財部。一九三一年他又痛斥法國陸軍的弱點，力主陸軍應全部機械化。未幾調任殖民部長，親赴越南，解決當地的事變。法國部長曾至蘇彝士運河以東的，應以萊諾為第一人，在當時確為一驚人的舉動。</p>
<p>海倫鮑爾特在皮倍斯哥郡主家中初次與萊諾訂交，正當莢諾自越　載譽婦來的時候，海倫時方盛年—　—二十六歲，而萊諾則已年逾知命—五十二歲了。</p>
<p>當時萊諾踮起脚尖，兩手揷在袋裏，即席演說道：</p>
<p>「中產階級以為祇有法西斯主義能保全資本主義，而免除共產主義的威　。但我們須回憶　索里尼的一件故事。那個故事說，一次某實業家剛把一塊金子送興墨索里尼，　氏就把金塊給他的老朋友法國社會黨賴伽台勒看，一面還笑着說：「資本主義，是要死在法西斯主義手裏的。」</p>
<p>可是海倫鮑爾特却是醉心於法西斯主義的。她心　想：「萊諾是個有作有為的人，也是共產黨的死敵，他不想獨裁，却是錯了。他是可以成為獨裁者的。」</p>
<p>她早已自命為獨裁者的夫人，不過當時還不敢反對萊諾，萊諾對她迷戀日深，她對於現狀，也就暫時安之若素了。</p>
<p>同時，裴齊埃小姐進行亦很順利，足與海倫鮑爾特　相輝映。她父親所製的沙丁魚，無盧有數千百萬罐，會為電布斐爾小姐未婚夫的克魯沙侯爵，便與裴齊埃小姐結婚。她是個快樂人，比之海倫小姐，雖較冷靜而稍欠活發，但其儀態高雅，却非海倫可及。她也像海倫一樣，需要一間會客廳。</p>
<p>鮑爾特伯爵和克魯沙侯爵在騎師總會鬥紙牌，那位侯爵夫人就在她客廳中招待左派和國際聯盟的要人。</p>

<h3 id="c49">螢光燈之裝置及電力公司管理章程 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 汪經鎔</p>
<p>螢光燈是屬於放雷管型之、一種燈，燈作管形，內無燈絲，惟管內灌以水銀及氬氣，管之裏層，塗上螢光質，（Fluoresoence）雷流一經通人管內後，即藉水銀蒸氣為導體，將　弧從一端傳於他端，此項　弧，即發生一種目不能睹之紫外光錢，此種紫外光綫，透過塗於管理之螢光質後，即發出明亮之燈光。</p>
<p>螢光燈之所以有種種色彩，其原因是管內塗有種種不同之螢光質，幅射之紫外光綫，能以不同之波長，透過不同之螢光質，於是發出各種不同之燦爛顏色。</p>
<p>輔助裝置　需學輔助之統制裝置，與其他放電管同，此種裝置，其主要者有二，一為調整器，（Ballast用以限制電流，二為發動開關，（StartngSwitch）用以自動啓閉電路，每燈需要裝置調整器一只，惟兩個調整器之機構，可合併裝於一匣之內，以供兩燈之用。</p>
<p>瓦特，週波，及電壓不同之燈管，均須裝置各種不同之調整器。</p>
<p>重要特點　茲將軍光燈與尋常之鎢絲燈比較，列其重要之特點如下：　在同一瓦特之下，螢光燈之光亮，較鵭絲燈多一倍。　其所發之熱度僅及錦絲燈之半。　根據一二兩條之推算，兩種燈於發出同等之光度時，螢光燈所生熱度，祇及鵭絲燈四分之一。　在室內溫度華氏七十至八十度時，螢光燈發光最强，室溫如降低，其發光力即隨之减弱，惟此種弱點，可以用燈罩裝在燈管外面，稍加補救。　螢光燈之標準壽命為二千五百小時。</p>
<p>利弊互見　世界各大城市所供給之雷流，其週波有五十與六二十之不同，而上海電力公司所發之電，係屬五十週波二二○伏脫之交流電，今年上海應市之螢光燈，頗多屬於六十週波者，茲據試騐所得，如以週波六十與週波五十之螢光燈，應用於上海公共租界內，則其各個之結果如下：</p>
<p>發光力　瓦特數　標準壽命五十週波燈　一○度　四○瓦　二，五○○小時六十週波燈　一一度　五二瓦　一，○○○小時（未完）</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>公元四世紀初年，晉司馬氏失政，五故交侵，中原倫　：這元帝　懷渡江，　都金陵：那些王　大族們，也紛紛南下以躲　　族的憑凌。是在這個時候，這些中原士大夫們　耳濡目染的學　了飲茶。你只要翻開當時人的詩文集或者如世說新語等書，你就可以看到那時人電飲茶已竟是多　平常和普通了。譬如吳中豪右在金昌　燕集，　季野造次　入，因為豪　不認識道位名士，所以只是、　左右多與著汁…不得食。任育長渡江，時賢此為　為茗？這有晉司徒長史王蒙好　飲茶，人　　命　之，士大夫皆患之，每　候往，必云…今日「水厄」…」更有隨安　　　，但設「茶果」等等：這不是很可證明　吃茶這件事情，已　成了當時招待客人的一種固定的禮節了麽？南北朝時，南方直接繼承東晋的流風遺俗，飲茶更是非常盛行。北方　呢，則因為和南朝信　往來或是有南人留　北土的關係，遂也把這種風氣　入，不過究竟只限於少數人士，而且後來還是阻力横生了的。洛陽伽藍記上把這事叙述的很淸楚，說是齊國的「王肅初入國，—魏國—不食羊肉及酪漿，常飯鯽魚　，渴飮茗汗。…經數年後，肅與髙祖燕會，食羊肉酪粥。髙祖怪之，顧肅曰（未完）</p>

<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>工部局日前雷厲風行實行管理物價，限制進口米每石不得超過一百三十元以來，市民們都感到極度愉快。目據公吿，李得爾由港來電稱：平準會已允以法定外滙供給工部局，以備採購足份食米，麺粉，食油，煤斤之用。這是個更可喜的消息。滬上民衆於風雨飄搖之下，得此扶助，眞有逖聽鼓舞感愧交迸之慨。此次政府為懷念無吿之滬上民衆，准予結匯，爽快地說，於國家經濟上乃是種不得已的浪費。但願我們於受惠之餘，永矢母負盛意。自然，對工部局此次的緊急措置，亦自覺愜意。</p>
<p>前些時候，當局在民食上，已數度有過限價的措置，但為了種種關係，效果未見良好；現在的一聲霹　，眞足警醒了一般上海冒險家的迷夢。（耍是還小會淸醒，一定是失掉了良知和靈魂。）當局曲突徙薪，更來個透底的物品登記，要這些魑魅魍魎，大顯原形。這須有賴於事關切身的市民們底合作。棧存米糧有一百二十萬包以上，足數本市食用半年而有餘，東西一淸二楚不過，最後自應不顧而子，公事公辦！</p>
<p>觀於昨日街頭　米長蛇陣，已絕跡無形，囤米公開發賣者更多，市民絕糧苦頭亦似可吿·一段落；然而更進一步，日用品的取得，亦不能再讓囤虎們施展伎倆。肥皂早已跌價，然而店家會一元一厚顏出籠；乳粉每罐限價十六元，而偏要二十二元才割愛，每匣火柴「內容」更見空虛，此亦是忍痛一法耶？煤球用戶一担一月者，今祇能用十六天，泥與膠水成份甚可疑惑；煤屑恐大都五成而已。……</p>
<p>用戶對於其他的偷工减料「常識大全」亦巳增進不少認識，如不肯做寃大頭，不妨與當局多多合作，此一時彼一時，囤戶大家可以休矣！</p>
<h3 id="c84">多多抑平日用品價格 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>兩租界當局，今番火速制裁米　後，全市數百萬市民，莫不額手稱頌，一般囤積之風，立受重大打擊，近日各種物價，大市行盤，一致傾瀉，此項斷然處置，眞是大快人心。</p>
<p>食米之管理辦法，已獲巨效，但一般日用品之物價，尙望兩租界當局，一如米糧辦法者然，目下一般奸商，雖懼查抄囤積，已有將貨物出節，尙有不少奸商，乘未臨頭實施之前，竟將價格狂抬，或用偷工减料之法，從中漁利，更有一般零售商店，批進時大市行般　巳跌價，出售反而加價，詐欺市民，其數亦不在少。如金神父路二十五號「餘×祥北貨海味號」，及四十七號之「豐×罐頭食品號」，均故意抬髙煉乳價格出售，會遭法捕房封閉，尙有同路七十六號之「兆×醬園」，亦被法捕房探員將所出之油類　瓶，携往馬浪路辦公處化騐油質成份及重量，與售價是否相符，法租界當局，對於零售商店，已逐步駁厲施行。筆者於月初時，向石路「××和」茶食店購買寸金糖三角起碼，其時白糖大市價三白四五十元；十一日去買起碼半元，問其每斤售價，答謂三元八角，然是日大市節價，已跌至二百六七十元矣。此種零售之上漲，莫明其土塊堂。</p>
<p>日用品中之最重要者，為煤球，火油，肥皂，煤斤來源絡繹大量抵滬，而烟白煤價仍在一味上漲，如九日之市情，暴漲一百元外，鴻基白煤，每噸七百八十元，抬髙至九百二十元；印度烟煤出千元關，均創新紀錄，是以近來之煤球出品，一般不顧信　之廠商，偷工减料，一擔煤球，出了十九元之高價，少燃三四日，人民受其不少暗　，火油限價每斤一元，竟無處去買，非再加三四角買不到一斤，（編者按。祇可買半斤。）有的竟不標售價。肥皂囤戶出籠，暗　狂瀉，不滿百元一箱，（一百二十塊），至零售商店，依然每塊售固本皂一元一二角，其餘如切麵點心店等食品，反在抬價，不勝枚舉。全市市民，尙仰盼兩租界當局，即將管理日用品價於短時期內付諸實施；或將物價一律標明，市民亦須台作，使非法謀利之徒，無所售其狡計，事固不難解決也。</p>
<p>兩當局採取嚴厲管理物價之舉，是奸商目作之孽。至於市民個人，對於米糧及日用百物，每家祇購取必需之數量，切勿乘機多購，或陰謀聚積，以免自尋煩惱。</p>
<h3 id="c85">靜安寺路戴上了孝 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 方明</p>
<p>從西摩路向南，在靜安寺路上向右轉，朝西了。這段路，在我是熟習的，也是常走的。見了横亙在半空中的一個「白彩懸橋」，中間加上了一個藍色的「奠」字，而且還「對」上了「頭銜」——東轅門。</p>
<p>這佈置，對我倒很生疏。</p>
<p>「那一家這樣神氣，「路祭」居然有上了這樣大的排塲？」</p>
<p>因為在上海看「路祭」是件很平常的事。只要是一張八仙桌，下面擱了幾條櫈子，或是另一張桌子，再在四面　上一條綉花桌圍，上面供上幾樣菜蔬。這樣一等棺材抬到，點起香燭，放幾個爆仗，燒掉些紙錠，這，就叫「路祭」了。</p>
<p>但，顯然地，今日的靜安寺路，不像是這套玩意兒了。</p>
<p>於是，為了一探究竟，就索性朝西。好在今日放假，而頭上面飄揚的就儘是中華民國的國旗，所以，心裏就感到　外的與奮。</p>
<p>在面朝着小沙渡路上的「愛儷園」門前前，就益發　得熱鬧了。這，才使我想起了今天是哈同夫人的領帖期，而恍然了。汽車，儘在門口出，進，進，出，忙得「不亦樂乎」？人頭也擠得漆黑地在蠕動。而園門上面的佈置，也不能算不「挺括」。</p>
<p>為了好奇，我跟妻兩人，預備進去一看究竟。到底，素色的佈置，使這哈同花園變成了怎樣的景色。可是，洩氣，到門口，被穿上「白長衫」的「執事」們擋了駕。而且，神氣得很。妻，在埋怨我多事。我却不以為然，只覺得有錢人好像是應該這樣的，要不，是　不出闊綽來的，於是，我默然了。</p>
<p>這樣，繞過「愛儷園」園門，我們叉向西了。</p>
<p>那知，出乎意料的，掛着「西轅門」頭銜的彩白「轅門」又出現在眼前了。中聞高髙的一個「奐」字，叉直覺地映進了眼　。</p>
<p>這，方使我瞭然了好不威風，像前天本刊上說工部局為公共交通，而商量哈同夫人將拋球塲（河南路口）的一段路面放闊而不同意。但工部局倒還是「慷慨地樣」偕用了靜安寺路給戴上了孝。甚至連人行道上的水門汀都連根找出來，給打竹樁子，這，不能不說交情濃厚了；但希望哈同遺產經管人，今後也能用治喪般的闊綽，用在公共事業上面！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops Possibly Attacking Yunnan from Vietnam; Chinese Troops Will Also Enter Vietnam to Bomb Japanese Military Targets; Drastic Increase of Japanese Troops in Northern Vietnam Preparing for New Offensive <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: A military spokesperson reported at a press conference this afternoon that this past week can be described as having no significant battles. The Xinyang battle is now in the past. Japanese troops have retreated to their original defenses. There are few Japanese troops remaining on the north bank of the Yellow River northwest of Zhengzhou. Therefore, the Zhengzhou battle is also coming to an end. The reason for the calmness on all battlefields is that the Japanese are busy preparing for a new offensive, possibly launching an attack on Yunnan from Northern Vietnam. Judging from the information received here, the Japanese new offensive is likely to focus on Yunnan. The number of Japanese troops in Northern Vietnam has increased from 30,000 to 60,000 and is still being continuously transported there. In the Hainan Island area, there are currently 130 to 140 various types of ships, 200 aircraft, several hundred tanks, and other transport vehicles, all of which will be transferred via Vietnam. Several Japanese warships are constantly patrolling the Pearl River estuary and the Qiongzhou Strait, presumably to cover a large-scale transportation. The aforementioned numbers may not be entirely accurate, but the overall situation is correct. Many reporters asked questions about the situation in Vietnam, but most of them could not be answered by the military spokesperson. For example, regarding rumors that Chairman Chiang had requested military assistance from Britain and the United States when the Japanese attacked, and whether the French would be considered an enemy state if the Japanese attacked Yunnan from Vietnam, the spokesperson declined to answer. However, he stated that if the Japanese attacked Yunnan from Vietnam, Chinese troops could certainly enter Vietnamese territory and aircraft could also go to bomb, but only military targets within the Japanese bases would be targeted. As for when the Japanese would launch the offensive, the spokesperson said that the Japanese should be asked. However, one thing that can be mentioned is that if Kurusu's trip to the United States fails, then the next two to three weeks will be crucial to watch. Regarding the aid China hopes to receive from Britain and the United States, the spokesperson said that it is not very clear, but it is no secret that China lacks air power. Therefore, assistance with air power would be the best. Assistance with ground forces, materials, and naval power would be even better. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson told reporters this morning that if Japan attacks Yunnan Province, China will bomb Vietnam, but this bombing will be limited to military targets only. Currently, the Japanese are busy in Vietnam preparing for an attack on Yunnan. The exact time of the attack cannot be predicted, but it is believed that there will be significant developments within two to three weeks when the success or failure of Kurusu's mission to the United States is revealed. It seems that the Japanese are likely to take four routes when attacking Yunnan Province from the north: 1. Meng Jiamo (transliteration) near Lao Cai, 2. Mali Lao (transliteration), 3. Qiancheng (transliteration), 4. Cheli (transliteration) near the Burmese border, because there are roads leading north into Yunnan from these southern Yunnan border towns. The other areas along the border are mostly sparsely populated forests. The main force of the Japanese army is currently concentrated in Lao Cai along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, clearly indicating an intention to attack from Meng Jiamo. It is believed that the number of Japanese troops gathered near the Burmese border is not very large. There are currently 5,000 Japanese troops along the Guangxi Province border engaged in building fortifications, clearly showing that the main attack will not take this route. When reporters asked whether China would request military assistance from Britain and the United States if the Japanese attacked Yunnan, the spokesperson did not answer. When reporters asked what kind of assistance China would most desire, the spokesperson replied that China would welcome naval and air force actions and the supply of materials. However, because China's air force strength is insufficient, assistance in this area is most needed. The spokesperson also answered questions about the nature of the ABCD military alliance, saying that because the alliance has not yet been formed, it is impossible to comment on it. When asked about the purpose of the visit to Yunnan by Major General Magruder, leader of the US military mission, and Major General Dennys, the spokesperson replied that he believed their purpose was to observe the deployment of Chinese troops in Yunnan Province and the transportation situation on the Burma Road. Finally, when a reporter asked about China's relations with Vietnam and Vichy, the spokesperson said that this matter should be directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is rumored that there have been movements of Japanese aircraft transport ships and warships in the Hainan Island area, possibly to Vietnam. (Reuters News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated today that the Japanese army has completed its deployments and is prepared to attack Yunnan Province at any time. The Japanese army will attack the Yunnan-Burma Road when it becomes clear that the talks between the Japanese envoy to the United States, Kurusu, and the US government have failed. However, if Kurusu reaches an agreement with the United States, the Japanese army will postpone its attack. The spokesperson pointed out that the Chinese air force will systematically bomb Japanese air force and army bases in Vietnam, but will only bomb military targets and not civilian areas. The spokesperson also stated that he could not comment on reports from Washington that Chairman Chiang had requested military assistance from Britain and the United States when Japan attacked the Yunnan-Burma Road. When asked what kind of military assistance China would welcome, the spokesperson said that all kinds of assistance would be welcome. Air force assistance and naval actions would be extremely valuable, and it would also be excellent if the Chinese army could be provided with armaments and supplies. The spokesperson stated that the Japanese army is extremely busy preparing for a new battlefield in Yunnan Province. The Japanese army's deployments have been completed and they can begin the attack at any time. In addition to Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Japanese army can attack Yunnan Province from four locations: Cheli, Jiangcheng, Mali Po, and Manhao from west to east. These four locations are all cities within Chinese territory. The spokesperson also said, "If the Japanese army attacks Yunnan, the Chinese army will drive them out of the border. If the Japanese army continues to fight after being driven out, then the Chinese army will continue to attack into Vietnam and regard Vietnam as a Japanese-occupied zone." The spokesperson added that Haikou is an extremely busy Japanese base, with several hundred tanks and tank transporters, a large fleet, and about one hundred transport ships gathered there. The Japanese army also has garrisons of less than a thousand men stationed at six locations on the Guangxi border. Major General Magruder, leader of the US military mission, and Brigadier General Dennys, the British military attaché, are currently inspecting the transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road, as well as the Chinese military preparations along the Yunnan-Burma Road and in Yunnan Province.

It is also reported that this case has been resolved by the Hong Kong government and the Japanese military authorities in Guangzhou. (United Press Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">US Treasury Department Revises Regulations for Managing Chinese Funds to Give China Complete Trade Control to Prevent Japanese from Exploiting Funds in Occupied Areas <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The Treasury Department yesterday revised the regulations for managing Chinese funds in the United States to give China more complete trade control. The Treasury Department amended the general note on Sino-US trade, allowing the Chinese Stabilization Fund or authorized banking groups to carry out trade matters. Treasury officials said that this change would allow funds transferred to China to proceed freely with the approval of the Stabilization Fund, whereas previously a special note was required. In the future, private individuals engaged in Sino-US import and export businesses must notify the Stabilization Committee with procedures already obtained from the Chinese government. All barter transactions are not included in this exception unless specifically authorized by the Stabilization Fund. Treasury officials explained that the tighter control of Sino-US trade will make all financial transactions impossible except through the Stabilization Fund. Therefore, it will give the Chinese government complete control over trade with nationals of both countries. Recalling that the United States ordered the freezing of Chinese funds on July 25, while also freezing Japanese funds, was requested by the Chinese government to prevent the Japanese from exploiting Chinese assets in Japanese occupied areas in China.

<h3 id="e12">Payment Methods for Sino-British Funds Also Changed <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>London: A new method for the payment of funds between China and Britain was implemented yesterday. Imports from China and exports to China from Britain will only be permitted on the condition that payments must be handled through approved banks. Other parts of the British Empire have also taken the same action. The above measures supplement the recent freezing of Chinese assets and the prohibition of exporting goods to China without a license. The current steps are being taken in cooperation with the Chinese authorities. The purpose is to help China gain control of its main source of foreign exchange and ensure that payments are made through approved institutions. This move will greatly enhance the ability of the Stabilization Fund Committee to adjust the value of Chinese legal tender and will provide more foreign trade. (Reuters News Agency, 11th-12th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Britain and the United States Maintain Firm Positions in the Far East; The Key to Peace or War Rests with Japan; The United States Will Not Abandon Basic Policies to Obtain Peace; If Japan Does Not Repent Soon, Disaster Will Be Imminent <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Washington, 13th: British Prime Minister Churchill's speech is naturally welcomed here and is what US authorities have been expecting. Tokyo's newspapers have been discussing it, which observers here see as another indication that Japan is gradually realizing the predicament caused by its own actions and its adherence to the Axis powers. Japanese diplomatic and military circles should now understand the perilous situation that will arise if they continue their aggressive policies, and have no illusions about it. As far as Britain and the United States are concerned, their policies have all been revealed. The only thing that is not clear is the strategy that Japan will decide upon when testing British and American policies. No warning is clearer than this about the crises lurking along the path of aggression. If Japan persists in its delusion, then its entire island nation will engage in a life-or-death struggle with the British and American maritime powers in the Pacific, with the support of China and the Dutch East Indies. This situation is the result of Japan's actions that have harmed British and American rights and its arrogant words that it will continue to harm British and American interests. It is now useless to be furious. From Washington's point of view, the US position has long been crystallized, that is, complete opposition to the Axis powers, and Japan's policy is inclined toward the Axis powers. The two are moving in opposite directions and have now reached a point of conflict. This is the danger that the US government is willing to take in its basic foreign policy of assisting democratic countries in resisting Hitlerism, because the US government sees Hitlerism as the greatest danger in the world today that can destroy the American way of life. Now that the conflicting policies of the United States and Japan have approached the point of conflict, there is only regret here, and no angry tones like those in Japan. The United States is still calm and closely engaged with all parties, which shows that the US policy will follow its established path. It is obvious and well-known that the United States does not want to buy peace from Japan at the cost of abandoning its basic foreign policy. Japan cannot hope that the United States will fight Hitlerism in the Atlantic on the one hand, and give way to Hitlerism in the Pacific on the other. Whether a US-Japan conflict will materialize depends on Japan. This is why the United States is quietly awaiting Kurusu's arrival in the United States with extraordinary interest. Many people here believe that the peace or war between the United States and Japan depends on what Kurusu is now carrying to the United States. There is no atmosphere of panic or anxiety in Washington, but a quiet atmosphere prevails because a faithful policy has already been formulated. Although the United States does not want war, if it is unavoidable, then 130 million people and the world's largest industrial organization will all do their best to support the government. In addition to the United States itself, British assistance will certainly not be insignificant, and China, assisted by the Allied air forces, is an effort that cannot be ignored. Churchill's speech is a clear expression of the parallel policies of Britain and the United States. The Baltimore Sun elaborated, saying that it was timely for the British Prime Minister to make these remarks, which showed that the positions of Britain and the United States are the same, with absolutely no intention of showing weakness or retreating, nor any provocation, so Japan has nothing to worry about except for the mania of its soldiers. Britain and the United States are giving Japan a choice and an opportunity. As far as the United States is concerned, national opinion has clearly reached a consensus, and even isolationist Senator Taft now supports the President's position. A contributor to the New York Times said that President Roosevelt will go to Warm Springs instead of staying in New York to wait for Kurusu, which is very meaningful and indicates that the President does not believe that Japan's attitude towards the China Incident has changed.</p>
<p>War Clouds Looming Over the Pacific</p>
<p>British Navy Completes Preparations</p>
<p>United Press Agency, Melbourne, 13th: Duff Cooper warned yesterday, "War clouds have spread over the Pacific, but Britain is ready." He also said, "In this world, the Pacific will be more important than in the past. Australia is a major power in the Pacific and will now bear unprecedented major responsibilities, obligations, and dangers. I am confident that Australia will also engage in adjusting Pacific issues." He said, "Churchill has warned that the Pacific is full of dark clouds, and he has told us that a large number of warships are heading to the center where a possible war will erupt. The navy in the Far East will immediately increase greatly. The warships have had excellent results elsewhere, so there is plenty of spare capacity to fight in any Pacific Ocean. Their participation will further determine the success or failure of the war." Duff Cooper also said that Australia's war effort, we only see a part of it, "If you know the majority of it, the whole world will be surprised."</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Singapore, 13th: People here are speculating about the nature of the naval forces that the British Prime Minister recently announced will be deployed to the Far East to deal with any emergency. Although officials have made no other statement other than guaranteeing that Singapore's great naval base is ready to receive British and American naval forces at any time, it is expected that at least one of the two latest aircraft carriers that the Prime Minister announced are ready for service will be sent here, as announced by Admiral Layton, Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet.</p>
<p>Another Symbol of US War Preparations</p>
<p>Plans to Deal with Enemy Aliens Prepared</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 13th: US Attorney General Biddle revealed yesterday that if friction occurs between the US and Japan, plans have been drawn up to detain Japanese nationals in the United States and its territories. This shows that US-Japanese relations are extremely tense. However, Biddle was very cautious and avoided using the word "war." It is said that this plan was jointly agreed upon by the Immigration Bureau under the Department of Justice and the Department of the Army. Officials have no intention of detaining all Japanese nationals in the United States, but in Hawaii and the Philippines, because their position has strategic importance for the security of the Pacific, group arrests of Japanese people will be inevitable at that time. According to the plan, Japanese who conspire and those who may be loyal to the United States will be detained together. The latter will be released immediately after individual investigations. The Attorney General, like other government officials, is concerned about the current state of US-Japanese relations because of the large number of Japanese people in Hawaii and the Philippines. However, it is also said that since the registration under the Alien Registration Act in 1940, there has been complete information on the loyalty of about 100,000 Japanese people in the United States, which is also one point that facilitates the implementation of the above plan.</p>
<p>Four Countries Form an Encirclement of Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo Newspaper Continues to Attack the United States</p>
<p>United Press Agency, New York, 13th: National Radio Corporation yesterday heard Tokyo Radio say, "Britain and the United States have already been pushed into a state of being unfit to fight against Japan." It also said, "What will happen on the battlefield in the future is only the inevitable result of the formation of the ABCD anti-Japanese unity."</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Today's editorial in "Chugai Commercial News" admits that Japanese diplomacy is too stubborn, and that the anti-Japanese sentiment of Britain and the United States is becoming more and more certain and cannot be tolerated. It continued, "We cannot sit and wait for destruction. We will not hesitate to cut the ropes that bind us." It is not difficult for us to do this. It also said that Japanese ships and Japanese people have suffered many losses due to Soviet mines. We can no longer remain silent. If the United States continues to carry out its current threatening actions in the Far East, the Washington talks will have no chance of success. At the same time, other newspapers are still attacking US Navy Secretary Knox's speech on Armistice Day. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" said that Knox should not have made irresponsible remarks and declared that peace had been lost at a time when Kurusu was going to Washington to pursue peace. Freedom of speech, if excessive, is also disgusting.</p>

<h3 id="e20">US Amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act Faces Serious Obstacles: Many Congressmen Suddenly Change Their Stance; Government Supporters Determined to Salvage the Situation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 13th: All news from Washington suggests that dissatisfaction caused by the government's labor policy will cause many congressmen, especially Southern Democrats, to vote against amending the Chinese Exclusion Act. Therefore, the vote is expected to be extremely close. It is said that House Speaker Rayburn was very surprised by this situation and reported to the President at the White House last night. It is currently estimated that about 140 Democrats will vote against it, and the changed Democrats may cause the passage of this bill to fail by one vote. Supporters of the government gathered for many meetings and did not disperse until this morning in an attempt to eliminate this shift in stance. All sponsors of this bill have been immediately recalled. Many congressmen who were scheduled to fly to England have been asked to postpone their trips until after the vote. Republican Congressman Fish predicts that opponents will win by a majority of fifteen votes. The "New York Weekly" today issued an appeal to the shifting congressmen, asking them not to vote against amending the Chinese Exclusion Act, saying that this move would greatly endanger the security of free nations around the world, and the domestic labor problem would still not be resolved.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 13th: According to House Speaker Rayburn, the House will pass the amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act, but he said that he will deliver a speech on this bill today, which is extremely rare for the Speaker. According to the previous plan, the vote on this bill will be held in the House between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM this afternoon. It is generally speculated that President Roosevelt may take some actions at the same time to help this bill, for fear that obtaining only a small majority may encourage Japan to continue its aggression. The "New York Times" also urged the House to pass this bill.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 13th: Although President Roosevelt personally made efforts to prevent the labor strike in the US coal mining industry, the US labor situation has now become bleak again, because the Long Distance Telephone Operators Union has officially announced that 15,000 long-distance telephone operators in 41 states will strike on Friday. The union is demanding a 4% pay increase. In his attempt to mediate the coal industry strike, the President has invited three leaders of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and three important officials of steel companies to meet with the President at the White House on Friday. According to steel companies, their own coal mines employ 53,000 miners. Although the dispute between the two parties has been handled by the National Defense Mediation Board, the mediation has rejected the miners' demands, which is not satisfactory to the workers, resulting in a strike that may occur, and other industries may also strike in response.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 13th: 350,000 US railway workers have received a notice from union leaders that they will start a strike on December 7, demanding a 30% pay increase.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 13th: The "New York Times" Washington dispatch states that, according to congressional sources, President Roosevelt is considering proposing a plan to end the strike if the House passes the amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act. It is said that this plan will guarantee the current wages in the national defense industry and increase them at any time to cope with the rising cost of living, but labor must promise not to strike in the national defense industry in exchange.</p>

<p>United Press, London, 13th: British King George VI declared yesterday that the British land, sea, and air forces in the Middle East have been greatly strengthened, and the British government is closely watching the progress in the Far East. "It is especially necessary to increase the troops there to protect the territory in that area." Speaking at the opening of the new session of the British Parliament, the King pointed out the memorable fact that the connection between Britain and the United States has been enhanced. The King said that this connection can be concretely demonstrated in the meeting between President Roosevelt and Churchill. The King guaranteed that the British people, the Empire, and its allies will continue to fight until they defeat the Axis powers and achieve final victory. He especially welcomed the Soviet Union as an ally and paid tribute to the heroic resistance of the Soviet army. He also pointed out that the Three-Power Conference held in Moscow was very satisfactory, and praised the work of the Royal Air Force and the determination of the British people. Field Marshal Sir Whitehouse addressed the King, warning Turkey of the danger of isolation. The King solemnly declared that post-war issues are already under discussion, and that the relationship between Britain and Turkey is based purely on confidence and friendship, and is very strong. He also warned that future work requires the continuous efforts of every individual. Churchill also issued a warning in Parliament, saying that Hitler's plan to starve the British Isles and force Britain to surrender has failed, and he may launch a full-scale invasion. Therefore, we must make full preparations so that we can cope with the incident when the weather is good and before the spring plums arrive." Churchill said that there will be no changes in the current cabinet.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e27">Quezon Reelected as Philippine President <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Republic of the Philippines has been holding general elections for days. According to the election results released yesterday, the incumbent Philippine President Quezon has been re-elected with an absolute majority. At the same time, according to the constitutional amendment, the first national congress of the Philippines, which has been newly organized, has also elected its members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, to replace the old one-house National Assembly. Apart from China, the Philippines is the only democratic country in the Far East. Although the Philippines did not gain independent statehood until 1935, according to the so-called Tydings-McDuffie Act; although the US control over the Philippines will not be completely abandoned until 1946; the increasing political status of the Philippines is obviously in sight, and it is indeed an optimistic factor in the overall situation in the Far East. Quezon is a veteran politician in the Philippines. Since he was first elected president in 1935, his administration has been active and steady, decisive and enlightened. Therefore, he is deeply respected and supported by the people. Judging from Quezon's re-election this time, the number of votes he received is enough to illustrate the consolidation of the current political situation in the Philippines. At the same time, the highest administrative authorities in the United States also have deep friendships with Quezon, so Quezon's re-election will also contribute a lot to the cooperation between the United States and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Recently, the overall situation in the South Pacific is unprecedentedly tense, and the status of the Philippines is even more valued. Legally speaking, the Philippines is still a region under US rule before July 1946; in terms of actual interests, the national security of the Philippines, like all US rights and territories in the Pacific region, is currently facing a serious threat from abroad. Therefore, US-Philippine military cooperation must be strengthened. In the US defense system, the Philippines was originally a prominent outpost, which is difficult to defend. Therefore, many isolationists in the US Congress shouted to abandon the Philippines to avoid being involved in the Far East vortex. But this call has now been completely convinced by President Roosevelt. This is not only because Roosevelt has a sharp eye and knows that no concessions should be made to the aggressor, and does not want to abandon the Philippines in danger, making it fall into a state of isolation and helplessness, but also because of the strengthening of British-American cooperation, Singapore has become a common fortress of Britain and the United States, that is, the Philippines has gained a solid rear to support it. On April 2 and October 3 this year, British Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham twice flew to the Philippines to discuss the joint armed defense of Britain, the United States, and the Philippines; at the same time, the United States also took two important and practical steps with the Philippine government, namely: The US President ordered on July 26 to incorporate the Philippine army and navy personnel into the US army, and appointed General MacArthur as the commander-in-chief of the US Far East Army to command them; On the 25th of last month, the US Department of the Army appointed Major General Pelletier, a first-class aviation expert, as the first commander of the US Far East Air Force, stationed in Manila, under the command of General MacArthur. After this arrangement, the defense of the Philippines has been greatly strengthened, and the air force is particularly strong, which will be a fatal blow to the Axis forces in the Far East. At present, the triangle formed by the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore shields the safety of the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and India on one side, and echoes the main force of the US Navy in Hawaii on the other. According to British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement on the 10th of this month, Britain can serve in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean with a powerful heavy navy, attached with necessary auxiliary warships when needed; yesterday, the foreign telegram also reported that the British fleet has set off for the Far East. Therefore, when the Pacific War is inevitable in the future, the activities and combat scope of the US fleet may be biased towards the North Pacific because the British fleet has entered the South Pacific. But even so, the Philippines is still an important communication station for the British and American naval and air forces. In addition, the traffic line between the Japanese-mandated islands in the South Pacific and the Japanese base in Vietnam is blocked by the Philippines, which will have an important effect on preventing the activities of the Axis submarines in the future.</p>
<p>The military importance of the Philippines has been described above. Now, because President Quezon has been re-elected, it will be easier to exert administrative efficiency and strengthen cooperation with the United States to cope with future changes. In addition to emphasizing its military value, the world also has a deeper impression of the situation in the Philippines, that is, democracy and the spirit of sincere cooperation between nations have been greatly developed in the Far East, and the current progress of the political situation in the Philippines is a clear sign of it. The Philippines was originally a region with a relatively late cultural development, and suffered many hardships during the Spanish rule. Since the Spanish-American War, although the United States has obtained the sovereignty of the Philippines, it does not enslave the people of the Philippines, but is determined to take the responsibility of developing the humanities and promoting its industry and commerce in the Philippines, and also gives it full freedom in political activities, so that it can accept democracy and finally produce the Republic of the Philippines. All these sincere procedures to promote international cooperation are a contrasting contrast to the policies and actions of the Axis group. Therefore, the connection between the United States and the Philippines is now a voluntary mutual assistance rather than a forced one. The "trial independence" of the Philippines is for a period of ten years, and most of it has now passed. Judging from the smooth progress of the general election in the Philippines this time, it can be concluded that its future is bright. At this time, the waves in the Pacific Ocean are turbulent and the war clouds are dense. The Philippines is joining hands with the major democratic countries, and may have to go through a very difficult struggle in the near future before it can extinguish all dark forces. However, with the correctness of the goal and the strength of the international anti-aggression line, the Philippines, which participates in cooperation, will surely gain more glorious harvests in the overall victory. Taking advantage of the opportunity of President Quezon's re-election, I would like to extend my congratulations to this emerging republic in the Far East.</p>

<p>International News Agency, Kupbishiv, 13th: Today's Soviet bulletin stated that the German army, which attempted to carry out a new pincer offensive against Moscow from the north and south flanks, has been repelled by the Red Army. It also stated that the Red Army in the counter-offensive has repelled the German army in the Kalinin and Tula areas. The counter-offensive on the southern front is still continuing in a sea of fire on the Donets Basin battlefield.</p>
<p>United Press, Kupbishiv, 13th: Soviet military news agency recently stated that the tension on the central Moscow front has eased in the past few days, and the Germans are currently reorganizing their troops and reinforcing new troops to prepare for a new attack on Moscow. A small German team in the Mozhaisk area attempted to break into the Soviet defense line, but was repelled by the Soviet army. The Soviet army also recaptured two villages. The news agency also stated that the German left wing has repeatedly attempted to invade the Vork River but ultimately failed, and that the Red Army on the Kororamsk side had surrounded a large German team on November 7, and is currently clearing the remnants in the area. Moscow's front has recently been snowing heavily, and the temperature has dropped to minus 15 degrees Celsius. The fighting in the Tula area has been silent for several days, and it has become fierce again yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: Soviet troops led by Focanov have repelled the German army by more than five miles after launching a fierce counter-offensive in the southern suburbs of Tula (10 miles south of Moscow). This is one of the major developments on the eastern front in the past 24 hours. Others worth mentioning are: Soviet troops continue to fight resolutely around Kalinin; The German side claimed to have reached the coast south of Kerch in the Crimean Peninsula; The German military spokesperson in Berlin admitted that various weapons are urgently needed; Trains carrying wounded soldiers are constantly entering Germany. According to Soviet Red Star News, the Soviet army in Tula is attacking the side of the German army. The German army, fearing encirclement, fled one after another, and was violently fired by the Soviet artillery and machine guns. The German army did not stop retreating until they encountered their military supply truck team. The Soviet army under Focanov allowed the German army to encounter a dense attack by German tanks and mechanized infantry, and was forced to retreat slightly, and then launched a fierce counter-offensive and made progress. According to TASS news agency, the German army in the Kalinin area is now suffering heavy losses. Although it has occupied several places, it has been driven back by the Soviet army's counter-offensive. The Berlin side claimed that the German air force violently attacked Kerch and Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula, and the port of Anapa on the Caucasus coast. In the Donets Basin, a large industrial area, the Axis army must pay a heavy price for every inch of land it occupies. The workers in the area implemented a scorched earth policy, and all factories that could not be transported were blown up. According to a dispatch from Soviet Zhen Daily, the German army saw only a piece of rubble in every city it occupied. The Soviet air force heavily damaged the enemy on the Donets front, and killed 3,200 German troops in one day. The German side admitted that the Soviet army in Leningrad also attempted to break through, but as usual, it said that it had repelled the Soviet army's break-through attack. The Hungarian Radio broadcast a Hungarian bulletin saying that the Axis army in the Ukrainian area had continued to occupy strongholds in front of Rostov and the Shakhty area.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 13th: According to diplomatic sources in Washington, Britain and the United States may make further efforts to end the Soviet-Finnish war. The plan they intend to make will provide some satisfactory guarantees for the security of Finland to prevent it from encountering attacks in the future. Washington believes that Finland's reply to the US message has not closed the door to continued discussions.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Washington, 13th: Finland has rejected the US proposal for a separate peace between Finland and the Soviet Union. After this news came out, Secretary of State Hull commented on it yesterday, criticizing Finland, saying that Finland is helping the Germans to obstruct the supply route to the Soviet Union via Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. It is not clear for a while whether the Finns are now helping the Germans in the overall war because of the Germans' good propaganda in the United States, but according to Berlin telegrams, the German military spokesperson said that the German-Finnish army has crossed the scope of the self-defense border, as for Finland's reply to the United States's proposal, I have not studied it yet, and its content has been published in the newspapers for limited time. It is believed that Hull's words are the final warning to Finland. If it does not make peace with the Soviet Union, it will risk Britain declaring war on Finland and the United States imposing economic sanctions on Finland.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th: Yesterday, authoritative sources here declared that the Murmansk railway line was bombed again by the German-Finnish air force on Tuesday. Traffic was blocked in several places, and Soviet property was heavily damaged. A Finnish aircraft squadron destroyed 12 locomotives and several transport trains in one week.</p>
<p>The joint action is making it extremely difficult for British and American supplies to reach Moscow and the Caucasus via Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. If this is true, then the actions of the Finnish army now appear</p>

<p>A Brief Biography of Huntziger</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 12th: The death of Minister of the Army, Huntziger, is a great loss to France. The following is a brief description of his life: General Huntziger was born on June 1, 1880, in Lesneven, Finistère, France. After graduating from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, he joined the French colonial army. In 1903, he participated in the Battle of Madagascar. Later, he returned to China to enter the Army University to seek further education. After graduation, he was promoted to Army Captain and was transferred to Vietnam to work in the French General Staff. By 1914, the European War broke out, and he returned to China from the Far East to lead the colonial army to the front to fight, repeatedly making meritorious service and repeatedly promoted. In 1918, he was assigned to the Third Hall of the General Staff and was awarded the Glory Medal. In 1924, he was promoted to Army Colonel, and was soon dispatched to China to serve as the commander of the French garrison. He served in China for five years until he returned to China in 1928 and was promoted to Army Major General. At that time, he was only 48 years old and was one of the young generals of the French Army. In 1935, he was transferred to the Middle East Command. In the spring of 1939, he led a military delegation to Turkey to negotiate a military agreement with the country. In September, the current European War broke out, and he served as the commander-in-chief of the Second Route Army. The general staff was in Yardanah City, resisting the German army in the Sedan area, which was very helpful. Later, he was transferred to the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Army Group, leading the French army to resist the German army on the upper reaches of the Aisne River, which made great contributions and was deeply trusted by Marshal Pétain. Therefore, after the armistice, he was dispatched as the French representative to attend the French-German Armistice Committee in Wiesbaden. In September 1940, Marshal Pétain summoned him back to Vichy and appointed him as Minister of National Defense. Later, he was transferred to Minister of the Army and began to carry out the army reorganization plan, reorganizing the French army within the scope of the French-German Armistice Agreement to make it a "unit with a small number of personnel but excellent quality." In addition, General Huntziger also devoted himself to boosting the morale of the "New French Army." In addition to increasing salaries and improving living conditions, he also vigorously promoted sports in the army.</p>

Atunkel has been appointed as the new Minister of National Defense, and Admiral Ekinci has been appointed as the new Minister of Communications. The motivations for the resignations of Alekan and Inticatay are related to the sinking of the Turkish ship "Refah" a few months ago. The ship was lost near the island of Cyprus. The cause of the disaster seems to have been due to striking a mine. After investigating the incident, it was claimed that the ship did not have lifebuoys or other necessary equipment. The route taken by the ship was also severely criticized. Therefore, the aforementioned two ministers submitted their resignations.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Female Calamities in French Politics <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>This article discusses the women in French politics. It is translated from the American magazine Esquire. The origins of France's decline can be seen here, not just the affairs during the artillery fire.</p>
<p>Before the defeat, France had two women, one growing up in a pile of soap, and the other befriending sharks. They were not daughters of high officials, but daughters of industrial giants. Not only were they wealthy, but they were also exceptionally beautiful, so they thought highly of themselves and harbored a kind of ambition. Both married into the aristocracy, and both wanted to interfere in politics and influence the fate of the country. The first was the Countess de Portes, and the second... In this crisis of survival, both played important roles. The names of both will be immortalized in history.</p>
<p>One morning in 1929, Miss Le Bèfevre was in Paris, with her jade legs crossed and her head held high. She was a brunette beauty, not very tall, but with full muscles, cherry lips slightly parted, and a pair of brown eyes emitting a moving and strange light. At that time, Miss Le Bèfevre had just made up her mind to conquer France!</p>
<p>How troubled she had been before! The days were passing, the time was wasted, and she was so anxious! Her father was the owner of several major soap factories near Marseille. She had studied at the best rural schools and had also been taught at the homes of relatives. Later, she met several political leaders of the middle class, and her ambition was aroused. She was eager to stand out and join the ranks of noble ladies.</p>
<p>Hélène relied on her youth and beauty, her charming appearance, and her rich dowry. In addition, she was extremely intelligent and good at manipulating people, so everyone who could be used by her fell under her spell.</p>
<p>She was not born into a noble family, but she was determined to become an aristocrat. This was the first obstacle she had to overcome.</p>
<p>She had a friend, Countess de Fleurieu, formerly Miss Gémon, who came from a famous family and later married a wealthy member of parliament. In social circles, princes and nobles were acquainted with her. Many of these young nobles were from declining families and had failed to find a spouse. Hélène asked Madame de Fleurieu to introduce them.</p>
<p>Fleurieu first introduced her to Marquis de Crussol, grandson of the famous Duchess du Cayla. Hélène and he fell in love and were about to get engaged, but by chance, she met Count de Portes, son of the Duchess de la Trémoille. Hélène had long dreamed of becoming a duchess, and Count de Portes had hopes of succeeding to the dukedom, so they fell in love at first sight and quickly got engaged. Although the Count was boring in conversation, he was elegant and debonair, and when he saw this intelligent and charming young woman, he was completely infatuated.</p>
<p>After Hélène married, she wanted to emulate Countess de Fleurieu and set up a salon to receive celebrities and scholars from political, financial, diplomatic, and academic circles. She wanted to imitate the beauties in Parisian society and become a behind-the-scenes figure.</p>
<p>What is a salon? For twenty years, it has played an important role in French politics, so it is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Some French women believed that the "weaker sex" had performed no less than men in the World War, so they wanted to lead the women's suffrage movement in France. However, they not only encountered the opposition of members of parliament, but also faced the indifference and hostility of most women. Generally speaking, French women have always had a sense of disgust and fear for politics.</p>
<p>But although they did not want to be involved in politics, they wanted to manipulate politics behind the scenes through their beauty and intelligence.</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Sarraut once said to a women's suffrage delegation: "Why do you still want the right to vote? Within the boudoir, we have already felt your influence."</p>
<p>The suffrage delegation was speechless, but the legacy of Madame de Pompadour, Madame du Barry, Madame de Maintenon, Madame de Teste, the Grand Princess, Madame d'Alienne, Miss George, Madame Walewska, Belles, Tessari, and Melotte and other women of virtue remained undiminished even through the Third Republic.</p>
<p>Women do not have actual power, but their indirect influence is even greater.</p>
<p>Before 1914, the rise and fall of the French government were determined in the salons of Madame Lunel, Madame Dauriac, Madame Bocquet, and Madame Jia Yafan (mother of Madame André).</p>
<p>After 1918, many women surrounded the League of Nations. Young and ambitious women like Hélène de Portes wanted to follow in their glorious footsteps.</p>
<p>Madame de Portes had extensive social connections and often hosted banquets or went out for social engagements. Her father discussed matters with Tardieu, who was in power at the time. She invited him as the chief guest at her first banquet. She introduced her husband's cousin, Colonel de la Rocque, leader of the fascist Croix-de-Feu, to Tardieu, but later Tardieu accused de la Rocque of soliciting and receiving secret funds. This meeting must have been regretted by de la Rocque. Miss de Portes also used the help of her classmate Odette de Peuneu to bring Georges Bonnet as her guest. Odette de Peuneu was the granddaughter of Bellerand, the founder of the Radical Socialist Party.</p>
<p>In addition, Madame Tabouis, whom she had known since childhood, and Princess Marina of Greece, who became the Duchess of Kent, were also guests that day.</p>
<p>She paid close attention to Laval, Flandin, and Tremoncier, but which one should she choose?</p>
<p>She hesitated for a long time. Although she met Reynaud through Tardieu and Renault, she did not initially take an interest in him. Later, in 1931, Princess de Bibesco invited her to dine with Reynaud and privately told her, "General Liautey told me that this man has a great future and will definitely rise to prominence."</p>
<p>From then on, Hélène began to pay attention to this politician, and seeing that Reynaud was very fond of her, her heart gradually leaned towards him.</p>
<p>At that time, Reynaud was just beginning to emerge. He was very thin, a little nervous, and spoke very well. His father was born in the Southern Alps and later made a fortune in Mexico. Reynaud did not belong to any party, and his thoughts were clear and his words were extraordinary, so he became famous at the time.</p>
<p>He first married Miss Henri, daughter of the chairman of the French Bar Association, Labour, and had a daughter named Colette, but later suddenly divorced.</p>
<p>Reynaud distinguished himself in the European War, so after the end of the war, he was elected as a member of parliament. Although he failed in the election in 1924, he was soon appointed as the representative of the second district of Paris. His several speeches in the House of Representatives about Germany made him famous and placed him among the national orators.</p>
<p>In 1930, Reynaud served as Minister of Finance because he had predicted the American financial panic six months earlier, and later his words were verified. In 1931, he also denounced the weaknesses of the French army and advocated that the army should be fully mechanized. Soon after, he was transferred to the position of Minister of Colonies and went to Vietnam to resolve local incidents. Reynaud should be the first French minister to go east of the Suez Canal, which was a surprising move at the time.</p>
<p>Hélène de Portes first met Reynaud at the home of Princess de Bibesco, just as Reynaud was returning from Vietnam with honors. Hélène was in her prime—twenty-six years old—while Reynaud was already over fifty—fifty-two years old.</p>
<p>At that time, Reynaud stood on tiptoe, put his hands in his pockets, and gave a speech:</p>
<p>"The middle class believes that only fascism can preserve capitalism and avoid the threat of communism. But we must recall the story of Mussolini. The story says that once a businessman had just sent a piece of gold to Mussolini, he showed the gold to his old friend, the French socialist La Catelle, and said with a smile: 'Capitalism will die in the hands of fascism.'"</p>
<p>But Hélène de Portes was fascinated by fascism. She thought: "Reynaud is a man of action and is also the enemy of the Communist Party. He is wrong not to want to be a dictator. He can become a dictator."</p>
<p>She had long appointed herself as the dictator's wife, but at that time she did not dare to oppose Reynaud. Reynaud's infatuation with her grew deeper, so she temporarily settled for the status quo.</p>
<p>At the same time, the progress of Miss Péchier was also very smooth, which complemented Hélène de Portes. The millions of cans of sardines made by her father were married by Marquis de Crussol, the fiancé of Miss Le Bèfevre. She was a happy person, more composed and less active than Miss Hélène, but her elegant demeanor was beyond Hélène's reach. She also needed a salon like Hélène.</p>
<p>Count de Portes and Marquis de Crussol played cards at the Jockey Club, while the Marchioness entertained leftists and League of Nations figures in her salon.</p>

<p>According to reliable sources yesterday morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) will begin taking action next Monday to suppress the abnormally high retail prices and will announce the maximum prices set by the Importers Association for imported goods and locally manufactured products. It is said that the new prices to be announced by the SMC on Monday will be supported by at least fifty major importers and manufacturers in the city who belong to the Importers Association.</p>
<p>SMC Decides to Take Immediate Action</p>
<p>The SMC announced yesterday morning that it will hold a special press conference at the SMC building today to describe the plan formulated by the Importers Association. According to Mr. Colai, secretary of the Importers Association, the Association will succeed in assisting the SMC to lower retail prices. A report has been submitted to the SMC, and action can be expected in two or three days. The Association is still seeking to acquire more members to strengthen its current strength. According to the Director of the French Municipal Council, French merchants will also join. Yesterday morning, all parties believed that as a result of the SMC's actions, prices here will quickly fall.</p>
<p>Flour Around Thirty Dollars Per Bag</p>
<p>It is understood that the SMC's fundraising of two million dollars to purchase flour is expected to receive full support. This morning (13th), the SMC received many applications from those willing to advance funds. It is expected that the decision can be finalized today. The SMC announced the previous day that it would solicit reputable firms to advance two million yuan to import flour. It is said that this money will be used to pay for the first batch of imported flour. The flour will arrive in Shanghai in a short period of time and will be sold under the complete control of the SMC, which will set the price. It is understood that Mr. Peterson of the Health Department will be in charge of the purchase and import of flour. This morning, the SMC held a special meeting to review the applications for advances for the first batch of flour. According to the above ratio of two million yuan for the purchase of 60,000 bags of flour, the future retail price of flour will only be around thirty yuan, which is much cheaper than the current market price of more than forty yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Restaurant Opens for Retail Sales</p>
<p>Mr. Jamie James, a well-known American restaurant owner in this city, opened the Silver Night Garden at the corner of Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road yesterday afternoon for the retail sale of major items. According to Mr. Lu, the items sold at the Silver Garden are limited to a profit of 10% to 20%. The items sold there include sugar, milk, coffee, soap, cigarettes, and several other items. Mr. James also said that the store will issue purchase books to 500 customers, all of whom must have family members. Once the variety and source of items increases, it is expected that the number of customers will increase.</p>
<p>Liddell and Others Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mr. Liddell, Chairman of the SMC, and American Director Smith, went to Hong Kong on the 2nd of this month to meet with the Price Stabilization Bureau to discuss the exchange rate and price issues in Shanghai and to request foreign exchange on behalf of the French Concession as well. Having completed their mission, they left Hong Kong by boat the day before yesterday and are expected to arrive here in the next day or two. It is believed that the SMC will convene an emergency meeting after the two return to Shanghai, and the two will report on the details of their contact with the Price Stabilization Bureau and the proposed plan for managing exchange rates and prices. Therefore, from next week onwards, the implementation of price management will inevitably have new developments, and the scope of management should also be expanded.</p>

<p>Eradicating the great enemy of the Shanghai people—tuberculosis—this is the goal of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association to raise one million yuan within one month from tomorrow. The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Liddell, and Mr. Smith, and three other gentlemen, specially hosted a banquet at the Citi Bank on Fuzhou Road at 8 pm yesterday, inviting the committee members of the Association and those who enthusiastically support the anti-tuberculosis movement. More than one hundred Chinese and foreign guests attended. The chairman was originally Mr. Liddell, but he was unable to return due to matters detained in Hong Kong, so Mr. Quan Shaowen took his place. He delivered a speech, welcoming the guests to participate in this grand event. Next, Dr. Haimingde reported on the horror of this fatal disease, tuberculosis, and hoped that all the attendees would give their full assistance to eliminate this fatal disease that is most rampant in Shanghai. Finally, Mr. Lu Meishen reported on the progress of the fundraising campaign, saying that the Association is conducting a one million yuan fundraising campaign to help build the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital and seek the health and happiness of all Shanghai citizens, appealing to all sectors of society for donations. The goal is one million yuan, starting from tomorrow for one month. Before this campaign has even begun, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have already generously donated large sums of money, with donations of 30,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan respectively, as well as US$300 and an X-ray inspection machine donated by a gentleman. Up to now, the amount pledged by various parties is at least 250,000 yuan. This kind of enthusiasm is admirable. Mr. Junfu said that all the expenses of this fundraising campaign of the Association are donated by private individuals, and all the funds raised will be used for public purposes. He hoped that all those present would work hard to promote it. After the speech, the meeting ended.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Laundry and Dyeing Industry Affected Due to Suspension of Coal and Gasoline Supply <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>After various goods in this city have been manipulated by speculators, market prices have risen daily, and some have even hoarded as much as possible without selling. Coal and gasoline are daily necessities for the laundry and dyeing industry. They were previously purchased from major oil companies such as Asiatic Petroleum, Texaco, and Mobil, and the Hongji Coal Company. Recently, these companies have stopped supplying due to a lack of sources, which has greatly affected the business of the industry. After the trade association requested the above-mentioned companies to accommodate, it is said that only Asiatic Petroleum will provide one hundred drums of kerosene per month, while the other companies have not had any results. Currently, the laundry and dyeing industries are only temporarily maintaining the status quo with a small amount of inventory. If the supply of raw materials continues to be tight, it is said that they will be forced to close down. There are about several thousand workers who depend on this industry for their livelihood. If they lose their jobs, their future is worrying, and it is also feared that it will create social unrest.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Study of the Origins of Islam <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongyi</p>
<p>"In the history of Chinese Islam, 'In the sixth year of the Daye era of the Sui Dynasty, it was declared to be holy.' According to the Religious Records, Year 44, and the Universal History, Year 45, it began to be declared to the public in the eleventh year of the Daye era, saying, 'An angel, Gabriel, threw this commandment, ordering the promotion of the teaching. Those who doubt that the scriptures are not divinely inspired will surely suffer divine punishment. Moses and Jesus were both angels, but I am the first to be enlightened, and I am to reform the old religion.'" Song Yuren's "Notes on the Customs of Western Countries" states, "Moses went up the mountain to receive commandments for forty days. Islam has forty days of fasting." The Dictionary of Christian Scriptures states, "Islam strictly observes circumcision," because Christianity replaced Moses' circumcision with baptism. Islam reformed the rituals of Christianity but still followed the Jewish rituals. His wife, nephew, friend, and five others were the first to follow him. After eight years, the number of believers increased daily. In the fifty-first year, the secret was leaked, and the bloodthirsty clan plotted to kill him, as seen in the "Comprehensive Records." The following year, he fled to Medina to avoid disaster. He met Jews and Christians who were fighting and killing each other over religion. The Qiyi people all abandoned their religion to follow him. This was in the fifth year of the Wude era of Emperor Gaozu of the Tang Dynasty, according to Quan Tu's collection. The "Foreign History" states the fourth year, and "Study of the Origins of Islam" states, "On June 16, 622 AD, he fled to Medina. The Islamic calendar began with this era." People from all directions converted, and the number exceeded tens of thousands. He then issued an order: "Those who disobey the command of my divine messenger will be attacked without mercy." Believers were willing to die for him, and they plundered the wealth of the city for their use. After several years of major battles, there were many deaths and injuries. Muhammad barely escaped with his life, and many complained. He then comforted them, saying, "God judges people who turn to evil and turn their backs on good, so he punishes them. If you sincerely believe, you will surely win the battle. If you give your life to promote the teaching, you will ascend to paradise. Those who are full of wounds and sores will emit light."</p>
<p>The "Study of the Origins of Islam" states, "The method of preaching is to hold the Quran in the left hand and a precious sword in the right hand, with the intention of unifying the Arab world. In the fourth year, he defeated Gulei, and in the eighth year, he captured Moga, and then subjugated all the vassal states, occupying the Arab world and ruling it." A Jewish girl poisoned the mutton shoulder that he ate, and he swore to destroy idols. As seen in Uchiyama Tadashi's "Encyclopedia of World Religions," he was about to attack the Fulin kingdom but fell ill. On February 28th, he gathered the people, entrusted them with matters, and passed away at the age of sixty-three. Mei Wending's "Zhaiqi" calculated the year of his death by inversely calculating the Islamic calendar, obtaining the year of death as the 14th year of Sui Kaihuang, which was July 14th of the Jia Yin year. The "Record of Waterways in the Western Regions" uses stone pillars to record the years, with the birth of Parka Gambal as the first year. Inversely calculating the Islamic year of 365 and one hundred twenty-eight out of 100,000 and twenty-one days, it should start on the third day of the third month of the sixth year of Wu.</p>
<p>His father-in-law, Biao Jie, relied on the power of his daughter, and his son-in-law, Ali, mobilized for war, fighting five battles over the power of the Qiyi. Because of this, the national language and classics were fixed. The people on the right, Biao Jie, were the leader of the Arab religion, called the Turkic sect. Ali won the war but eventually fled to another city, founding the Persian sect. Later, the Eastern sect, wearing black, traveled in Asia, the Western sect, wearing white, traveled in Europe, and the Southern sect, wearing green, traveled in Africa, forming seventy-three sects.

<h3 id="e49">Installation of Fluorescent Lights and Management Regulations of the Power Company <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jingrong</p>
<p>A fluorescent lamp is a type of gas-discharge lamp. The lamp is tube-shaped and contains no filament. Instead, the tube is filled with mercury and argon gas, and its inner surface is coated with a fluorescent substance. Once an electric current is passed through the tube, the mercury vapor acts as a conductor, transmitting an electric arc from one end to the other. This electric arc generates invisible ultraviolet radiation, which, when passed through the fluorescent substance coated on the tube, emits bright light.</p>
<p>The reason why fluorescent lamps have various colors is that the tubes are coated with different fluorescent substances. The radiated ultraviolet light, with different wavelengths, can pass through different fluorescent substances, thus emitting various brilliant colors.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Equipment Requires auxiliary control equipment, similar to other gas-discharge tubes. This equipment mainly consists of two parts: a ballast (used to limit the current) and a starting switch (used to automatically open and close the circuit). Each lamp requires a ballast. However, the mechanisms of two ballasts can be combined into one box for use by two lamps.</p>
<p>Different lamps with different wattages, frequencies, and voltages require different ballasts.</p>
<p>Important Features The important features of fluorescent lamps compared to ordinary tungsten filament lamps are listed below:</p>
<p>At the same wattage, fluorescent lamps are twice as bright as tungsten lamps.</p>
<p>They generate only half the heat of tungsten lamps.</p>
<p>Based on the above two points, when emitting the same amount of light, fluorescent lamps generate only one-quarter of the heat of tungsten lamps.</p>
<p>Fluorescent lamps emit the strongest light at room temperatures of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If the room temperature decreases, the light output will also decrease. However, this weakness can be somewhat compensated by installing a lampshade on the outside of the tube.</p>
<p>The standard lifespan of fluorescent lamps is 2,500 hours.</p>
<p>Advantages and Disadvantages The electric current supplied by major cities around the world has different frequencies, with 50 and 60 cycles being common. The electricity generated by the Shanghai Power Company is 220 volts alternating current at 50 cycles. Many of the fluorescent lamps available in Shanghai this year are designed for 60 cycles. According to tests, the results of applying 60-cycle and 50-cycle fluorescent lamps in the Shanghai International Settlement are as follows:</p>
<p>Light Output Wattage Standard Lifespan</p>
<p>50-cycle lamp 10 degrees 40 watts 2,500 hours</p>
<p>60-cycle lamp 11 degrees 52 watts 1,000 hours</p>

<p>De Kang, a three-year-old boy, son of Qian Jinfa, a Changzhou native and owner of Fuchang Box Shop at 34 Rehe Road, went out to buy things with cook Shen Xichu, worker Liu Chuanda, and relative Ma Erbao at 7:00 PM on the 20th of last month and never returned. The next morning, someone called to inform them that the child was eating somewhere and not to worry. Qian Jinfa was very surprised. The following day, he received a letter asking him to go to Tushanwan in the Chinese area to negotiate. Later, another letter stated that his child was in another port, taken by Shen, Liu, and Ma, and demanding a ransom of 400,000 yuan for his return, or his life would be in danger. Subsequently, Ma Mingqi, Ma Erbao's father, went to Tushanwan to negotiate with the gang several times. He negotiated a minimum ransom of 5,000 yuan. They agreed to send someone to talk near Guangdong Road and Hubei Road the day before yesterday afternoon. The gang leader, Yu Qin, claimed that 5,000 yuan was too little. Qian Jinfa reported the situation to the Huishi Police Station. Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Huang Fusen, Inspector Liu Zhaonian, and Detectives Ma Bingzhang and Guo Xiangyao, along with Western Detective Cheng Yicheng, disguised as merchants, went to the agreed location at the appointed time.</p>
<p>After observing the area, no one came to negotiate. After a while, they arrested a local suspect, Zhu Wenlong, in room 32 of the nearby Wuzhou Hotel. They found a photo of Qian's child on his person. Upon questioning, he confessed that his accomplices were hiding at 299 Lane 17 on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The detectives rushed to the address and arrested four Changzhou natives: Chen Meiqi, Wang Xiaolang, Ding Menqiao, and a woman named Ding Mao. They confessed that other accomplices, Zhou Heshang and Xia Heshang, both Changzhou natives and workers at the North Railway Station, were nearby near the junction of North Henan Road and the Chinese Concession. They lured those people and Xia's wife, Wei, out and arrested them.</p>
<p>They confiscated another photo of Qian's child and a silver neck ring that had been pawned at the Xinda Pawnshop in Changzhou for ten yuan, along with the pawn ticket. In total, eight suspects, men and women, were arrested and taken to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, detailed the case. Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Han Guangyi, a 41-year-old native of Zhenjiang, currently works as an employee of the Four Banks Savings Society. Years ago, he became acquainted with Fan Liu, a 35-year-old woman from his hometown, and they lived together in rented accommodation at 26 Hankou Road. Their relationship was still good. However, she was fickle and loved fashion. Every time she went to public entertainment venues, she met Yue Zhiyi, a wealthy businessman from Yangzhou, in a game hall. She transferred her affections to Yue and began a clandestine affair.</p>
<p>This secret affair was discovered by Han. Having ascertained the truth, he harbored the idea of killing the woman. He bought a dagger some days ago. On the morning of the day before, Han coaxed the woman out with the excuse of going out with him. They went to room 34 of the Traffic Hotel at 487 Avenue Edward VII. At around 10 p.m. that night, Han, seeing that the woman was asleep, pulled out the dagger and stabbed her, severing her throat. She died instantly. A waiter, hearing a strange sound coming from the room, went inside to investigate and discovered the tragedy. He immediately telephoned the French Police, who sent a Chinese detective to arrest the murderer and send the body to the mortuary for examination.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reports that a masked foreigner, armed with a handgun, broke into the residence of diamond merchant P. Bileiyu, located in the Matthews Apartments, shortly after noon this past Tuesday, with the intention of robbery. The perpetrator, identified as Chevali, a Georgian, was arrested yesterday (the 12th) by Public Concession Detective O'Siannikov. He will be brought before the First Court this morning (the 13th) for trial.</p>
<p>The details of the robbery are as follows: Shortly after noon on Tuesday, the Chinese servant at P. Bileiyu's residence opened the door and saw a masked foreigner with a handgun. The servant was unable to call for help and was bound hand and foot and locked in a small room. A minute later, P. Bileiyu's friend, Mr. A, came to visit and was also bound and locked up. The robber was about to search the premises when another friend of P. Bileiyu, Mr. Rosenbang, also visited. Caught by surprise, he was threatened with the robber’s gun pointed at his chest. Standing very close, Rosenbang, disregarding the danger, suddenly kicked the robber’s abdomen, causing the robber to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>As the robber fell, his finger jerked on the trigger, firing a bullet, which whizzed past Rosenbang and entered the door. The gun fell to the ground. Having lost his advantage, the robber leapt up and fled out the door. At the top of the stairs, P. Bileiyu happened to return and collided with the robber. P. Bileiyu, alert to the situation, knew that the robber was a villain and fiercely chased him from behind. However, the bound foreigner had escaped his bonds and shouted loudly. P. Bileiyu let the robber go, as he was armed. The robber was able to escape. The police were notified and immediately began an investigation, leading to the arrest of Chevali in Hongkou.</p>

<p>The Charity Basketball Tournament held by the Paramount Sports Association of this city to raise funds to donate to the Shen Bao's student aid fund, the Xinwen Bao's student loan fund, and the school advancement fund for children in orphanages, inviting Shanghai's strongest teams, Lan Bai and Hu Xing, to play two-game, two-win exhibition games with Paramount, has been successfully completed. All proceeds from ticket sales and the auction of autographed basketballs were supervised by Accountant Chen Fangjie, dispatched by Accountant Xu Yongzuo, who attended each event. Afterward, all accounts were submitted to Accountant Xu for voluntary audit and are now ready. The full figures were officially announced last night at the Paramount reception for newspaper reporters. The three games between Hu Xing and Paramount saw 200 honorary tickets sold in the first game, totaling 2,000 yuan, and 118 general admission tickets, totaling 354 yuan, for a total of 2,354 yuan. The second game saw 189 honorary tickets sold, totaling 1,890 yuan, and 130 general admission tickets, totaling 390 yuan, for a total of 2,280 yuan. The third game saw 154 honorary tickets sold, totaling 1,540 yuan, and 44 general admission tickets, totaling 132 yuan, for a total of 1,672 yuan. Paramount's three games against Lan Bai added a special honorary ticket category, priced at a hefty 100 national currency per ticket, with general admission tickets also raised to 5 yuan per ticket. However, special honorary tickets were not sold for the first game. 225 honorary tickets were sold, totaling 1,250 yuan, and 174 general admission tickets were sold, totaling 870 yuan, for a total of 3,120 yuan.

Adding the 1,500 yuan from the purchase of autographed basketballs by Mr. Zhu Shizhen, a steel industry magnate and director of the Lingyou Basketball Team, the grand total was 19,131 national currency, setting a new record for revenue from any basketball tournament in the city. This sum, after being equally divided into three shares by Accountant Xu, with each share amounting to 6,377 national currency, will be donated by Paramount to the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and the orphanage for the disabled within days. All expenses for the event were generously covered by the Gu Li Guangsen and Kang Kun brothers of Paramount. In terms of ticket sales, we also received sincere assistance from all sectors. For example, the 20 special honorary tickets, totaling 2,000 yuan, were exclusively purchased by Mr. Gu Qianlin, a celebrity who runs the Shu Ping Student Loan Fund. The Lingyou Basketball Team not only exerted physical effort but also sold a significant 3,660 yuan worth of honorary tickets. Other notables such as Shen Jialin, Li Xiangxu, and chief and deputy secretaries Lu Dazhen and Mao Hongfa, as well as famous performers Zhang Boming, Chuan Ru, and Chen Ruisheng, etc., each purchased 500-600 yuan or 300-400 yuan worth of tickets. Miss Zhang Peiying, a famous dance star, also promoted and sold a remarkable 1,000 yuan worth of tickets, a testament to her enthusiasm. Other dance stars such as Xu Liumei, Li Meili, Cai Didi, Xie Li, Wang Qinna, Tian Zhujun, Zhang Youyou, etc., also contributed enthusiastically.

<p>The grey market for public bonds suddenly experienced an unusual surge yesterday, with a rebound exceeding two yuan compared to the previous day and four yuan compared to November 3rd. The market was filled with buying sentiment, largely due to the Huachiao Bank's vigorous buying throughout the day, accounting for approximately half of the total trading volume. There were many short positions in the market, and a sudden wave of short covering and investment caused prices to rise sharply in a straight line, a rare phenomenon in the past two weeks. While Rundong led the buying on the floor, many parties were reluctant to sell due to the situation. However, short sellers remained active. Although prices of commodities and various speculative items are gradually declining, or due to the impending withdrawal of the US Defense Forces, these factors have little relation to public bonds. The outlook has been optimistic for several days, but the strength of the surge was unexpected. The future trend still has momentum. At the opening yesterday morning, Rundong first bought Class C bonds, opening at 66 yuan, which was 4.5 jiao higher than the previous day. Xiexingyuan and Renchang also had demand, supplied by Juxinlian and Jiuli, etc. Retail trading was also extremely active, with prices rising gradually from six yuan to seven yuan, which was already surprising. The closing price at noon was even higher than seven yuan. The afternoon trading was even more active, with Rundong absorbing even more volume. Tongshun and Dingkang increased their long positions, Jiufenglian and turned from short to long, and Datongshengda also covered positions. Renchang came back with long positions, Juxin continued to sell, Hongda and Zhongfu emerged, but demand still exceeded supply. Class B bonds rose to eight yuan, Class A also broke through four yuan, and Class B and E also rose by more than two yuan. As a result, market prices rose sharply across the board by 1.4 jiao to 2.4 jiao. The total turnover was approximately 3 million yuan. A summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 67.12 | 66.70 | 67.12 | Up 1.25</p>
<p>Unified B | 69.40 | 68.40 | 69.40 | Up 2.5</p>
<p>Unified C | 68.00 | 66.00 | 67.95 | Up 2.40</p>
<p>Unified D | 65.00 | 64.80 | 64.90 | Up 1.40</p>
<p>Unified E | 67.20 | 66.10 | 67.20 | Up 2.0</p>
<p>In stock trading, 500 shares of Huashang Electric were traded, with a price of 18.5 yuan per share. Other transactions were dominated by ABC underwear new shares, opening at 32.5 and closing at 24.25, showing the large number of investors in Chinese stocks, far different from the frequent ups and downs of foreign stocks.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market was dominated by selling pressure all day. It opened softly in the morning, and rumors were rife after the opening. Sellers sold off without price limits. There was a slight recovery in the afternoon, as Zhongxin's morning rumors were said to be unfounded. However, the sellers soon reapplied pressure, and the stocks fell sharply. It only stabilized slightly near the close, but the decline was significantly different from the high prices this week.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Monday) - Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East real estate companies' stocks: bank stocks fell again. The Jardine Matheson Bank share fell 5 shillings to £9 5 shillings. HSBC England-registered shares fell by half a pound to £79, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell by one pound to £85.

<h3 id="e71">Gold Market Falls <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was complicated and volatile, with the market trending downward. The price has fallen within the 20,000 yuan mark, due to unfavorable rumors about US-Japan conflict affecting gold, causing banks to re-enter forcefully. Dafeng bought another 1,540 taels. However, under the influence of Hong Kong, Chaozhou, and Tianjin gangs, the price was pushed down from 20,580 yuan to 19,100 yuan. Near noon, Tianyuan and Xianghe entered forcefully to over 20,000 yuan. However, in the afternoon, Qianzhuang gangs also came out to sell, and a fall was seen again, closing down 700 yuan, and further down to 19,850 yuan after closing. The total daily trading volume was 19,480 taels. Ornaments also fell 80 yuan to 2,020 yuan. Silver was still listed at 28 yuan, but the black market had fallen to 24-25 yuan.</p>

Shihe and Lianyu sold forcefully, and a further reduction of 200 yuan was seen to 20,100 yuan. Unexpectedly, Dafeng and Defu suddenly entered forcefully, and retail investors forcefully pushed up the price, immediately jumping 480 yuan to 20,580 yuan. However, as Shihe started selling again, Xianghe, Tianyuan, Xiangxingyong, and Hengji also competed to sell, and after hearing of US-Japan conflict, Defu suddenly dumped a large amount. Kangyong, Lianxing, and Shunyuan also sold, and the price fell by more than 1,400 yuan, retreating to 19,100 yuan. At noon, Tianyuan and Xianghe re-entered, urgently covering their short positions, and flew up 1,200 yuan, reaching 20,300 yuan. The noon closing was at 20,250 yuan. In the afternoon, the price was suppressed by selling pressure, reducing it by 250 yuan to 20,000 yuan. Decheng, Chengji, Xiangxingyong, Shunyuan, Tianyuan, and Xianghe competed to sell and forcefully suppress the price, and a further reduction of 450 yuan was seen, falling to 19,550 yuan.

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in the central exchange rate, and the small exchange rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchanges hardened, amidst rumors of US-Japan conflict. The US dollar bill fell to around 38 yuan. A Chinese businessman with funds offered to sell a U.S. dollar position for 3 yuan in British business bank accounts, but there was no response. British exchange 2/-125 had less supply than demand, and only stopped loosening at noon. The afternoon situation was more stable, British Exchange 2/- and U.S. Exchange 3 yuan were available for settlement, which was looser than before the break.</p>

<p>The yarn market is falling, due to the tension in the Far East and rumors, all negative, causing the long positions to feel uneasy, and the sellers are too enthusiastic, causing the market to gradually decline. The rumors are even more prevalent after New Year's Day, saying that the U.S. Defense Forces are preparing to withdraw, which makes people even more nervous. 20-count single-strand yarn opened at 2,730 yuan, but with more and more sellers, it fell to 1,670 yuan and was declared at the limit. The off-market price was 2,700 yuan, and the final price was 2,690 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is unanimously bearish, but raw materials are still difficult to loosen significantly.</p>
<p>Double-strand yarn opened at 2,820 yuan in the morning and briefly rose to 2,840 yuan. Later, after hearing that the exchange price fell, the market became looser as there was more selling than buying, and it gradually fell to 2,755 yuan. However, as the low price fell, profitable people replenished the market, and it rose again, fluctuating between 2,780-2,790 yuan for a long time. Upon reaching the closing bell, rumors spread, and the momentum was very weak, and it gradually fell to close at 2,708 yuan. It is found that the total turnover of the half-day statistics was 2,950 bales.</p>
<p>The gold-linked futures market was miserably suppressed under the shadow of negative sentiment. The cause was the uncertainty about how the overseas situation would unfold and the withdrawal of the U.S. military, causing extreme anxiety. Buyers were very cautious, and many long positions came out, coupled with the monopoly of short positions and speculators, causing the long front to be unsteady. Therefore, the market saw oversupply throughout the day, and the prosperous atmosphere of the past was swept away. In the near term, there was even a disastrous limit down in the afternoon. The market opened in the morning with many rumors, and the gold market softened. Yarn market followed downstream, with the near-term opening at 2,680 yuan, down 20 yuan, December 2,790 yuan, down 50 yuan, and January 2,850 yuan, a small drop of 90 yuan. Although there was a slight rebound in the afternoon, with the sellers continuing to dump, the trend continued to fall, and by noon, it had fallen by more than 150 yuan. In the afternoon, people were increasingly uneasy, and the market became more depressed. Factory orders first fell to the limit, and the yarn followed down. The near-term also fell to the limit, with December closing at 2,655 yuan, down 185 yuan, and January closing at 2,750 yuan, down 190 yuan. The table is shown below:</p>
<p>Month | November | December | January</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Opening | 2,680.0 | 2,790.0 | 2,850.0</p>
<p>Highest | 2,690.0 | 2,79.0 | 2,860.0</p>

<p>The current cotton situation shows a weak sentiment. However, those holding the goods are unwilling to sell at the low market price, but the situation is worse. Coarse lint is trending downward, while fine lint is still flat.</p>

<p>—Woolen fabrics are soaring like a runaway horse.</p>
<p>The cloth market trend was weak yesterday, due to many rumors. Short positions rushed to sell, but most buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, causing the price to fall even more sharply. Later, due to the slight rise at the exchange close, the decline gradually stopped. As a result, coarse and fine cloth twill fell by 2-7 yuan, and the prices of bleached and dyed cloth were also chaotic, falling by 3-5 yuan. More than 600 pieces were traded on this street.</p>
<p>Dongbu's actual sales are stagnant, and the falling wind is strong again. The exchange price for forward delivery of cloth fell sharply by 4.48 yuan to 6.71 yuan per bolt. In the spot market, the people were even more uneasy. The Longtou fine cloth factory orders opened at 99 yuan in the morning, and closed at 93 yuan in the evening, a sharp drop of 9 yuan per bolt compared to before the closure. The minimum price for the four gentlemen of colored goods, serge, was 3.445 yuan in the forward market, and returned to 3.45 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>Woolens: Spring goods such as willow pattern, herringbone, plaid thin wool, thin serge, Dali and Western-style plain spring wool, summer goods such as flannel feather yarn, standing valitin, fat skin and yarn linen rubber cloth, white straight tribute white serge, etc., have been trading, frantically stockpiling, and market prices are soaring like a runaway horse.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Rice Market Still Not Open <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Australian Yanglun brought 12,439 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The ship is currently docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf and will be moved to the Company's Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading in the coming days.</p>
<p>Since the authorities used a swift cut to limit the price of rice to 130 yuan per picul, the market colleagues have been tangled up over the sold goods. Although a meeting was held, it was still difficult to resolve. Because this method benefits the original local clients, and harms both the wholesale distributors and the rice colleagues, it has been opposed. Yesterday, various colleagues reconvened at the Food Guild to discuss solutions. The municipal market operations remain in a suspended state.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Although the Price of Foreign Flour Has Fallen, There Are No Buyers <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The sentiment in the foreign flour market is negative, and there are no buyers. The price of Golden Dragon brand has been lowered to 40 yuan, but there are still no buyers to receive the goods. Small bags of wheat bran have been lowered from 52-3 yuan to 50 yuan, and only a few rural households have a few ways.</p>
<p>The price of wheat is also flat, but there are very few stocks in the market. Since the sale opened at 75 yuan the day before yesterday, the sellers have not been willing to lower the price again. Spot hoarding sales are being sold.</p>

<p>Last month's forward contracts for oilseeds were settled and closed out in a complex market situation. (The market still saw yesterday) (Cooking oil due to scattered selling pressure saw a sharp price decline of ten to twenty yuan. Corn and other grains also showed weakness.) The quoted price for Dalian soybean oil was 345 yuan, Qingdao soybean oil was 330-340 yuan, and refined soybean oil was 225-220 yuan. Rapeseed oil was 230-220 yuan, Yoshida's rapeseed oil was 230 yuan, Taishan rapeseed oil was 220 yuan, and Chongming sand-red beans were 88 yuan. Yellow corn was 46-44 yuan, white corn was 44-43.5 yuan, and yellow glutinous corn was 50 yuan. It is also heard that the forward oilseed contracts for October are being mediated by a certain party commissioned by both the bulls and bears, and price settlements have already begun.</p>
<h3 id="e80">One Cannot Go a Day Without Speculation, Thus Turning to Sugar Market Development, First Falling Then Rising More Than Twenty Yuan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Since various speculative targets such as rice, flour, and daily necessities have been subject to market fluctuations and are gradually being controlled, speculation seems to have declined significantly. This can be used to raise prices, like gambling, giving the impression that "one cannot go a day without speculation." Thus, the sugar market is being developed. Yesterday, the sugar market first saw a decline due to hoarding and selling, showing weakness, but then the sugar market found an opportunity to rise. The previous large increase was 25 yuan, and the minimum was more than 10 yuan. By the afternoon, a certain party strongly supported the price, rising from 8 to 22 yuan. However, the spot price increase was limited, only 2-3 yuan, showing a clear difference between speculation and actual sales. Taking yesterday's market as an example, this is even more evident. Futures for 24th grade coarse white sugar for delivery on the 20th opened at 252 yuan, closed at 56 yuan, reached a high of 78 yuan, and a low of 45 yuan. Outside the exchange, it was 65 yuan. In the afternoon, it opened and rose to 80 yuan, closing even higher at 92 yuan, with after-hours trading at 98 yuan. Futures for the 30th opened at 272 yuan, closed at 78 yuan, reached a high of 85 yuan, and a low of 67 yuan. Outside the exchange, it was 74 yuan. In the afternoon, it opened at 87 yuan, jumping to 94 yuan, with after-hours trading breaking the 300 yuan mark, at 302 yuan. Spot prices for October imports were 262 yuan, 53 yuan, 60 yuan, 64 yuan, and in the afternoon, 70 yuan, 75 yuan, 69 yuan, 73 yuan. September prices were 256-263 yuan, and in the afternoon, 68-72 yuan, an increase of 2-3 yuan. Hong Kong group sugar suffered a severe drop in the morning to 220 yuan, then rose to 30 yuan, and in the afternoon, 40-44 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 210 yuan, briefly falling to 193 yuan, then rising to 204 yuan, and in the afternoon, 210-213 yuan, still a slight decrease of 12 yuan compared to before. Taikoo car white HX was 230 yuan, and in the afternoon, 40-50 yuan, with no change. A total of over 50,000 bags of coarse sugar futures were traded, and over 25,000 bags of coarse sugar spot were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,022 bags of granulated sugar arrived, transported by the Taikoo Company's Hanyang wheel from Xiangqiao. A large shipment of Dutch sugar came via the Zhazawa Company's Zhishaluya, originally scheduled to arrive the day before yesterday, but had not yet been imported as of last night. According to the company, it is expected to arrive today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Coal market, outside hoarders, learning from the past mistakes of the rice market, are all cautious and have come out of the cage one after another. Moreover, a certain company's urging of warehouse receipts has also become a problem, so after-hours trading has plummeted, collapsing like a torrent. Yesterday, Hongji white coal old orders were transacted at 800 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan from the previous week's peak, but few buyers came forward, and everyone held a wait-and-see attitude. People's hearts are looking downward, and the market atmosphere has calmed down.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Tea (2) <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth century AD, the Jin Sima clan lost power, and the Five Barbarians invaded, causing chaos in the Central Plains. Emperor Yuan crossed the river and made Jiankang the capital. Those Wang clans also went south to avoid the oppression of the barbarian clans. It was at this time that these Central Plains scholar-officials learned to drink tea through what they saw and heard. If you only look at the collections of poetry and prose by people at that time, or books such as Shishuo Xinyu, you can see how common and ordinary it was for people at that time to drink tea. For example, Wu Zhong's wealthy families held banquets in Jinchang, and Ji Ye suddenly entered. Because the wealthy families did not recognize the famous scholar, so the attendants gave him...mostly with vegetable juice... and he did not get to eat. When Ren Yuchang crossed the river, contemporaries regarded it as drinking tea? This is because Wang Meng, the chief clerk of the Jin Situ, liked drinking tea, and people considered it a calamity, and every time they went to visit, they would say... today there is a "water disaster"...". There are even banquets with only "tea and fruit", etc. Isn't this proof that drinking tea had become a fixed etiquette for entertaining guests at that time? During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the South directly inherited the customs and habits of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and tea drinking was very popular. In the North, because of contact with the Southern Dynasties or because of the Southern people staying in the North, this trend was also introduced. However, it was ultimately limited to a small number of people, and later there was still resistance. The Luoyang Qielanji describes this very clearly, saying that Wang Su of the Qi Kingdom, "When he first entered the country -- the Wei Kingdom -- did not eat mutton or cheese, and often ate crucian carp and drank tea. ... After several years, Su and Gaozu had a banquet together, and ate mutton cheese porridge. Gaozu found it strange, and turned to Su and said (unfinished)</p>

<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's recent swift and decisive implementation of price controls, limiting the import price of rice to no more than 130 yuan per picul, has made citizens extremely happy. According to public announcements, Liddell cabled from Hong Kong stating that the Stabilization Fund has agreed to provide the Shanghai Municipal Council with legal foreign exchange to purchase sufficient amounts of rice, flour, cooking oil, and coal. This is even more welcome news. The people of Shanghai, amidst the storm, are deeply moved and grateful for this assistance. The government's approval of foreign exchange settlement for the sake of the people of Shanghai is, frankly speaking, an unavoidable waste in terms of national economy. However, we hope that while benefiting from this, we will never betray this great kindness. Naturally, we are also satisfied with the Municipal Council's emergency measures.</p>
<p>Some time ago, the authorities had taken price-limiting measures on several occasions regarding people's food, but due to various reasons, the effects were not good. Now, this thunderous action is enough to awaken the delusions of some Shanghai adventurers. (If they are still not sober, they must have lost their conscience and soul.) The authorities are taking proactive measures and conducting thorough registration of goods, revealing the true form of these monsters. This requires the cooperation of the citizens who are directly affected. There are more than 1.2 million bags of rice in storage, which is enough for the city to eat for more than half a year. Everything is clear, but in the end, we should not hesitate to act impartially!</p>
<p>The long queues for rice on the streets yesterday have disappeared, and more people are openly selling stockpiled rice. The suffering of citizens without food seems to have come to an end. However, furthermore, the acquisition of daily necessities must not be allowed to be exploited by hoarders. Soap prices have already fallen, but stores shamelessly demand one yuan per bar. Powdered milk is limited to 16 yuan per can, but they insist on charging 22 yuan to part with it. The "contents" of each box of matches are even more empty. Is this also a method of painful concession? Coal briquette users who used to use one load per month can only use it for 16 days now, and the mud and glue content is highly suspect. It is feared that coal dust accounts for the majority, perhaps 50 percent.</p>
<p>Users have also gained a lot of knowledge about other ways of cutting corners. If they are unwilling to be taken advantage of, they should cooperate more with the authorities. Times have changed, and the hoarders can rest!</p>
<h3 id="e84">Suppress Prices of Daily Necessities More Often <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>After the authorities of the two concessions swiftly punished the rice merchants, millions of citizens in the city praised them. The general trend of hoarding has been severely hit, and in recent days, the prices of various commodities have been falling across the board. This decisive action is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>The management methods for food rice have achieved great results, but the prices of general daily necessities are still hoped to be managed by the authorities of the two concessions, just like the methods for food rice. At present, although some unscrupulous merchants are afraid of being searched for hoarding, they have already released some goods. However, there are still many unscrupulous merchants who, before implementation, are raising prices wildly or using methods of cutting corners to profit from them. Moreover, there are also many retail stores that increase prices instead of selling at lower prices when the market prices have already fallen during wholesale, deceiving citizens. For example, "Yu × Xiang North Goods and Seafood Shop" at 25 Jin Shenfu Road and "Feng × Canned Food Shop" at 47 Jin Shenfu Road intentionally raise the price of condensed milk for sale, and were closed by the French police. Also, "Zhao × Sauce Garden" at 76 Jin Shenfu Road also had the oil bottles sold by the French police detectives taken to the Malang Road office to test the oil quality composition and weight, and whether the selling price was consistent. The French Concession authorities have gradually begun strict implementation for retail stores. At the beginning of the month, when the author went to the "×× He" tea and snack shop on Shilu Road to buy inch-gold sugar triangles at the base price, the market price of white sugar was 340-350 yuan. When I went to buy it on the 11th, the base price was half a yuan. When asked about the selling price per catty, the answer was 3.8 yuan, but the market price had already fallen to 260-270 yuan on that day. The increase in prices from this kind of retailer is inexplicable.</p>
<p>Among the most important daily necessities are coal balls, kerosene, and soap. Coal supply sources are arriving in large quantities in Shanghai, but the price of smokeless white coal is still rising. For example, on the 9th, it soared by 100 yuan. Hongji white coal was raised from 780 yuan per ton to 920 yuan. Indian smokeless coal exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, both setting new records. As a result, the manufacturers of coal balls have been disregarding good faith, cutting corners, and charging as high as 19 yuan for a load of coal balls, which burn for three or four days less, causing people to suffer a lot of losses. Kerosene is limited to one yuan per catty, but there is nowhere to buy it, and it is necessary to add another 30-40 cents to buy one catty (Editor's note: only half a catty can be bought). Some don't even mark the selling price. Soap hoarders are selling off their stocks, and after-hours trading is plummeting, with less than 100 yuan per box (120 bars). However, in retail stores, each bar is still sold for 1.12 yuan. Other foods such as sliced noodles and snack shops are raising prices, which is too numerous to mention. The citizens of the city are still looking forward to the authorities of the two concessions implementing the management of daily necessities prices in the short term. Or mark the prices uniformly so that citizens can cooperate and prevent those who illegally seek profit from selling their tricks. The matter is not difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The strict price management measures taken by the two authorities are the result of the evil deeds of unscrupulous merchants. As for individual citizens, each household should only purchase the necessary amount of rice and daily necessities, and must not take the opportunity to purchase more or conspire to hoard them, so as to avoid self-inflicted trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Jing'an Temple Road Wears Mourning Clothes <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Ming</p>
<p>Turning south from Seymour Road, turn right onto Jing'an Temple Road, heading west. I am familiar with this road and walk it often. I saw a "white arch bridge" stretching across the air, with a blue "Dian" (offering) character in the middle, and it was even "matched" with the "title" - Dongyuanmen (East Garrison Gate).</p>
<p>This arrangement is unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>"Which family is so impressive that the 'road sacrifice' actually has such a large display?"</p>
<p>Because watching a "road sacrifice" in Shanghai is a very common thing. As long as there is a baxianguo table, with a few benches underneath, or another table, with an embroidered table skirt on all sides, and a few vegetables are offered on it. When the coffin is carried over, light incense and candles, set off a few firecrackers, and burn some paper ingots. This is called "road sacrifice."</p>
<p>But, obviously, today's Jing'an Temple Road doesn't look like that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, in order to find out, I simply headed west. Fortunately, today is a holiday, and the flags of the Republic of China are flying above my head, so I feel extra excited.</p>
<p>In front of the entrance of "Aili Garden" facing Xiaoshadu Road, it was even more lively. This reminded me that today is Mrs. Hardoon's invitation day, and I suddenly realized. Cars were constantly coming out, in, in, out of the gate, busy and "delighted"? The crowds were also packed tightly and wriggling. And the arrangement above the garden gate cannot be said to be not "stylish."</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, my wife and I prepared to go in and see what was going on. After all, what kind of scenery has this Hardoon Garden become with its plain decorations? But, disappointingly, at the entrance, we were stopped by the "deacons" wearing "white long shirts." And they were very arrogant. My wife complained that I was nosy. But I didn't think so, and just felt that rich people should be like this, otherwise, they wouldn't be able to show off their wealth. So, I was silent.</p>
<p>So, bypassing the entrance of "Aili Garden," we turned west again.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the colorful white "Yuanmen" (Garrison Gate) with the title "Xiyuanmen" (West Garrison Gate) appeared in front of us again. The character "Huan" (mourning) was clearly reflected in my eyes.</p>
<p>This made me understand how majestic it was. Just like what this publication said the day before yesterday, the Municipal Council was discussing with Mrs. Hardoon about widening a section of the road (Henan Road intersection) where the ball court was located for public transportation, but she did not agree. However, the Municipal Council still "generously" put mourning clothes on Jing'an Temple Road. Even the cement on the sidewalk was uprooted and bamboo piles were driven in. It cannot be said that the friendship is not deep; however, I hope that the Hardoon estate managers can also use the same generosity used in the funeral on public undertakings in the future!</p>

<p>How could Begonia know about this situation? Although he had been with several troupes in Shanghai, no matter how meddlesome he was, he would never have thought of going to the martial arts training ground in Jue Benyan to make an appointment. Around ten o'clock, it was finally his turn to fight.</p>
<p>"Third Brother, the situation is a bit off today, you have to be extra careful!" Before going on stage, the martial arts manager also saw through Zhang Yincai's intentions, so he quickly walked over and whispered a few words to Begonia.</p>
<p>Begonia was playing a small demon under the command of the Black Wind Monster in the fourth scene of Journey to the West that night. He had been on stage four times already. Because he was only following the old demon on and off the stage, he couldn't see how those colleagues were planning to make fun of him. When the martial arts manager told him, he felt a little anxious.</p>
<p>After a burst of loud gongs and drums, the four little demons played by Begonia and the four "little heavenly gods" under the command of the Monkey King waited together at the entrance of the stage.</p>
<p>He was ranked fifth, with a single knife stuck in his waist, watching the two demons and two gods in front of him with wide eyes. His heart was beating harder than when he first took the stage in the training class more than twenty years ago. (262)</p>

<p>Attention Qinghan University and Middle School Students</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student Relief Committee (sponsored by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA), which is known for its aim to provide relief to poor students and managing the "Qinghan Student Scholarship" and creating the "Student Economic Canteen" every semester, recently learned that the severe winter is coming. In order to solve the problem of winter clothing for poor students in the city, it has specially consulted with the Shanghai Friends Service Council and will distribute a portion of the winter clothes donated by American churches to Chinese compatriots to poor university and middle school students in the city, regardless of gender and religion, who are deemed permissible by the association. It is understood that there are as many as four types of clothing, namely: 1. Thick coats for men and women, 2. Men's suits, 3. Velvet shirts, 4. Leather shoes. The procedures are very simple. The applicant only needs to provide a letter of introduction from the school authorities or faculty members and personally bring it to the association for registration. However, it should be noted that the letter of introduction must include details of the applicant's academic performance, conduct, name and occupation of the parents, and family background, and must also have a recent photo of the applicant attached to the top of the letter and stamped by the school for verification, otherwise it will not be valid.</p>
<p>It is also known that the association has started registration on the 12th of this month, the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. Male students can register at the Student Department of the YMCA at 23 Minthini Avenue, and female students can register at the YWCA at 323 Mulming Road.

<p>— Jianzhou</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying came to Shanghai in succession, making the silent singing world shine brightly. Fish and bear's paw can be obtained at the same time, so what is the joy of the opera fans? Fuying's voice is becoming more pure and mellow this time. On the evening of the play "Taiping", I rushed to watch it. The wonderfulness of the play has long been established. Mr. Fei Mu even praised him as a treasure in the singing world. It is not an overstatement. "Wearing a golden helmet, a section of erhuang, the rhyme is very good, it is effortless to pull up the high notes, the capital is sufficient, there is no match in the world, the tiger jump of relying on when captured is clean and neat, the quick board of scolding the account is light, round and fluent, and does not fall into ingenuity, the body and eyes are especially good, the opening fight is slightly lacking in solemnity, and the skill is not yet pure. Wang Quankui's Chen Youliang has a full voice. The two good voices do not give way to each other. Listening to them is enough to relieve sorrow and hate. Hao Houjin and Liu in front of you are not the orthodox copper hammer. The late-comers are not self-reliant. Shishi is also a good deputy clean. Below Kui, it is not enough to count. Only Ma Liankun can match him. Jiang Miaoxiang's Zhu Wenxin is an old-fashioned type, which does not lose its rules, but twisting his head and shrinking his neck is not as good-looking as Sheng Lanzhenfei! Zhang Junqiu's Wuhua Cave is a play for rest. Although the voice is high, it is floating and unreal. Several new tunes are difficult to get rid of the axe marks at the turning point. When singing, the mouth is wide open, which damages the beauty. It is Wang Ranqiu, who plays the real Jinlian, whose old tunes are quite worth listening to. Yang Shengchun's Xifu Mountain is a play for civil and martial old students. Shengchun is lacking in voice, so it is not the right job, and the performance is less wonderful.</p>
<p>I watched Yanqiu's plays three times, with "Suo Lin Nang" being the best, "Wang Baochuan" being the second best, and "Daughter's Heart" being the third best. The big flowing section of "Suo Lin Nang" in the Spring and Autumn Pavilion is like pearls falling on a jade plate, with each word being clear. The wonderful thing is that it is fast without being chaotic. The new tune of Xipi Jiaduo board and Erliu turns the crying head is swaying and graceful. It is very interesting. Among the supporting roles, Liu Binkun's Meixiang is the best. "Wang Baochuan" is all old-fashioned. The slow board of "Wujiapo" and the sleeve work are excellent for a while. The figure of entering the kiln is fat and lacks agility. It is a pity that Baosen's voice is poor. When the two of them sing together, Yanqiu has to suppress his voice to accommodate him, and the excitement is lost. The warrior princess in "Furongcao" starts the circle, which is very skillful. It is not possible without a veteran. In "Daughter's Heart," Yanqiu plays Princess Baihua. The first half is a martial woman. The scene of Gu Yu and Jiang Liuling secretly meeting in Baihua Pavilion has complicated and beautiful body movements. The facial expressions are suddenly angry and happy, and the daughter's heart is truthfully transmitted. It is a masterpiece. The scene of raising troops and ordering generals is full of singing and dancing, like butterflies flying through flowers, which is dazzling. The second half retreats to the nunnery and has a large section of anti-erhuang, which composes a new voice for a cavity of sorrow, listening to it, the whole intestines are wavering, and I want to shed tears. Inserting all the clowns in the middle to play the disabled villagers who come to the nunnery to offer incense, although it is enough to relieve the humor, it is slightly unreasonable. Huang Jin uses excessive clowns. There are always such scenes interspersed in new plays. Baosen's body on the stage has no trace of anger. I think it is just right, which is better than Fuying. It is a pity that the talent is not as good as Fuying, and the voice is worse. If the strengths of the two people are combined into one, it would be a happy thing! This time, Huang Jin has Yang Baozhong and Zhou Changlin, two good violins, each showing their magical powers, doing their best to set off the moon. In addition to listening to songs, the audience can also enjoy the violin. Although the ticket price is high, it is worth it.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: At Dusk, Nomad Cavalry Fill the City with Dust</p>
<p>"Now, I can only ask my esteemed brother to wait a while. As long as we fight our way to Beijing, we will know what's what." Liu Yining sighed and said, "Fight our way to Beijing? By then, it will be too late for regrets. Since General Wu is determined to suppress the rebels, why did he retreat to Shanhaiguan, acting so timid and fearful, allowing the rebel bandits to run rampant? Alas! I know he doesn't truly want to suppress the rebels. He only wants to retrieve his beautiful concubine, Chen Yuanyuan. How can such a man, who only knows his family and not his country, accomplish great feats, eliminate the primary evildoer, and ultimately end up hesitating halfway, begging for help from foreign lands? It is truly reaching the end of the road and acting perversely. What ability does he have to recover the country? He is only creating opportunities for foreign races. Therefore, I really don't want to serve under him anymore. I advised you all to leave early. Who knew that Chai Ying would chase you back? Who are we going to work for from now on? Throwing a pearl into darkness, is it not a pity!" Xu Jing listened and nodded, saying, "Every word Liu brother speaks strikes my heart. I am not truly happy to serve here again either. Brother Zhang says whatever he thinks and is a man of great emotion. Since he has said so, we must stay temporarily for the sake of loyalty. Liu brother, don't be angry. In the future, you and I will always be together. If you really can't stand it and want to leave, I will definitely go with you. Although my brother and I met by chance and became sworn brothers, the weight of our friendship is far greater than others. I am honored by your kindness and constant attention. No matter what, I can't forget it. (128)</p>
