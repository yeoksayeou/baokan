<p>社評</p>
<h3>靜觀穩定外匯方案之實施</h3>
<p>自從平準基金委員會委員福克斯氏到了上海，上海的黑匯市塲驀然地起了波動，忽張忽弛；聯帶地發生許多言說，彼亦一是非，此亦一是非，究孰是而孰非，且不暇去論。但要講到外匯，本來是多方面，且亦富於錯綜性，原不是簡單一句話可以解決。何况今日之上海外匯，既然稱之為黑市，難免不名副其實，更不易覓得妥善之處理。古諺有之，「事難兩全；」兩全尙難，而欲多方面求全，不亦難之又難。大概每事常利弊兼生，而弊之所以生，即在於利，有利才欲作弊。所以防弊無論如何周密，理論如何堂皇，而事實所在，終有不可刋磨者在。</p>
<p>既有所謂平準基金，亦必有其不平不準者在，方欲平之準之。此在出產豐富收益浩大之國家，或許收多付少，無所用其平準，然至收益過多，黃金作祟，九仭宮墻，可望而不可即，終亦見其財多為患。更有物彙之不能齊，天產之不能勻，供求之不盡同，盈於彼，絀於此，不能無淸算，不能無調劑，此其間自然有順逆之分，高低之殊。至於出多進少，即不得不動用存項，或出於借，出於欠，不借不欠，不為維持，任其自生自滅固可，而信用隳落，有不可勝言。故儘有物物交換制度，儘管略取物產，以圖抵償，仍有未足，而欲套取外匯。至於管制外匯，所影饗於貿易者如何，各國儘多先例在，如以其為不便者除之，合於彼不合於此者則改善之，改善而無可改善，防範之，取締之，補救之，皆為應有之義，而不容因噎廢食，遂謂取締防範之不當。</p>
<p>事未可以一概論，亦不可以盲從，大抵公事應以公態度出之，不容存私見。今日之上海匯市，牽涉太多，一孔千瘡，補救匪易，以如此複雜之問題，只有從其大者　者，不應從小者近者以為言。一有人欲之私，即有所蔽有所蔽，即所見不淸。外匯問題，國策之所繫。所謂國　也者，必能於國計民生，兼籌並顧，內憂外患，利害輕　，比較得失，而後何去何從，廓然大公。自近數年來，金融上每有所措施，市塲上早有所動作，國家尙未見其利，人民尙未蒙其益，惟有於中一般投機分子，耳長手快，捷足先登，發大財，致巨富，腰槖豐滿。弊之所屆，使謠言往往成為事實，於是投機市塲之謠言更多，信之者益衆。即如福克斯氏方將自滬赴港，而香港方面即有維持英匯四辨士一二五之電訉，雖儘可闢之為謠，但謠至有確定之數字表示，非同無根之謠可比。今日外匯之所難，從一般生活之困苦艱難，及法幣信用，固冀其長。然長則既有巧取豪奪，復有投機吸收，若不於外匯買有所管制，所謂合法需要，乃至合於民生需要，與不合法及不合於民生所不必須之需要，紛然雜沓，仍無以別。短則更足以助長逆勢，人心搖惑，投機囤積之風愈盛，生活恐慌無所底止，此於民生非福，亦豈與國計有利。故維持至何種程度，自經福克斯氏來滬調查，想必胸有成竹，在未有依法表示之前，無所用其臆測。但冀其切實做到對於正當商業之合法需要，始終不予漠視，應儘量供給外匯，而於投機者之買賣外匯，以及陰謀者之套匯，均在嚴厲取締之列，採取有效杜絕之辦法。這一點，正是大衆所殷切盼望，靜待着香港會議之結果，非但用以穩定目前的外匯，且於未來的法幣，商業的興衰，民生的艱裕，均有深切的影響。</p>
<h3>美國將竭力援華　華軍定秋季反攻　英美注意保衛滇緬路　郭外長對戰事極樂觀</h3>
<p>香港　此間大公報所載專訪稿稱、中國外交部長郭秦祺宣稱、「羅斯福總統曾親口吿余、美國將竭力協助吾人人、」郭氏並謂、「美國將儘量利用緬甸公路、運軍用品於吾人、倘日本進攻緬甸、美國意見認此項進攻、其重要性正與侵略新加坡相等、」英國政府對於日本取道泰國侵入緬甸之可能性、現方予以相當之注意、郭氏相信、倘有充分之防禦準備、則日本難以實行此次進攻、蓋緬泰邊界一帶之山地、最難從事軍事行動也、郭氏宣布、英美不久即將實行協助中國、加强在未來反玫中之空軍實力、渠稱、「蘇德戰爭開始以來、日本遭遇前所未有之孤立、日本現旣不能戰勝中國、又無力攻擊蘇聯或向南海進攻、此實間接加强英美在該地區之力量、日本雖出以威脅與恫嚇、但在與荷印之談判中、無法獲得多少成就、日本可行之唯一途徑、厥為增加中國前綫之軍隊、但吾人之軍事力量、每經一戰而愈增加、吾人對於日方之最後努力、毫無所懼、囚美國對華支持巳成為非常確定、此間中國人士希望不久可得飛行堡壘、不僅用以資助陸軍之大舉反攻、抑且用以轟炸日本、惟衆認此種長距離轟炸機不得不由美國志願飛行員駕駛、良以中國飛行員、除在美國受訓者外、不熟悉此種巨型飛機之複雜機械也、中國定於秋季反攻、惟須視此後三個月內美國供應品是否大量運達及美國物品所不得不經過此緬甸路情形如何而定、（十一日國際社電）</p>
<p>郭外長對全國廣播</p>
<p>重慶　郭外長九日晚七時在中央廣播電台、對全國廣播、題為「國際反侵略陣綫」、大意謂、提起國際反侵略、我們就不禁有些豪意、在四年前、侵略的勢力開始抬頭、但是許多國家並不曾覺察、有些姑息容忍、乃至放任、以為不妨遷就一時、免得糜爛大局、獨有我們中國、在英明領袖的領導之下、認定侵略者得寸進尺、並無止境、要保障國際和平正義與人類自由幸福、只有不顧一切、予打擊者以打擊、我們不貪圖苟安、不囿於短視者所謂現實、更不為一國一時之私、以鄰為壑、儘管以弱敵强、儘管當時列强多勸我們妥協讓步、我們還是高舉義旗、發出反侵略的砲聲、決不養　貽息、我們是反侵略的先鋒、而後來事態的發展、和今日的國際局勢、更證明我們認識的絕對正確、說中國是全世界反侵略運動的前驅、我們也可當之無愧、為健全這個得來不易的國際反侵略陣綫、使他能够達成他的神聖使命、我特提出下面兩點意見、（一）助强陣綫的組織、（一）堅定必勝的信念、在此四年中、我們抱定反侵略的意志、以不變馭萬變、國際形勢的發展、正如我們的預期、一切愛好自由反抗侵略的國家、近已很自然地站在一條戰綫、反觀日本、內心愈惶怯、行為愈張皇、每次想取巧投機、總落得面面不討好、塲塲塌了空、現在我們要握住這個有利的時機、存着行百里半九十的戒心、繼續奮鬥、以竟全功、最後勝利、一定是屬於反侵略一方面的、也就是屬於我們的、但請記着努力、是成功的保障、（十日電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　（六八）　派特魯斯基印象記</h3>
<p>波蘭偉人及世界鋼琴聖手派特魯斯基，Ignace　Jan　Paderewske近在紐約逝世，茲將紐約秦晤士報記者關於他的印象記一篇，迻譯如次：</p>
<p>波蘭自古多豪傑之士，派特魯斯基，亦不同凡俗。他是藝術家而兼政治家，富於人道精神與愛國熱情。</p>
<p>不多幾天以前，他坐在紐約一家中等旅館的小會客室裏，體氣不十分健康，但工作不辭勞瘁，可見他因體力漸衰，不得不放棄政治生活云云，已證明全不可靠。他自去年十一月六日（他的八十歲壽辰）到紐約以來，曾向美國籍波蘭人發出幾次呼籲，並進行波蘭難民救濟工作。他不顧知已朋友的勸吿，依然工作不息，在嚴格規定的少數鐘點以內，悉心工作，不肯虛耗一分一毫的精力和光陰。他平均每天工作兩小時，有時還不止此。</p>
<p>我穿過一間堆滿什物的房間，但屋中沒有一架鋼琴，令人覺得奇怪，也為之怏快，到另一間屋子裏，便見到端坐在桌前的派特魯斯基。他的服裝，凡訪問過他或欣賞過他音樂的人們，無不瞭如指掌—長長的大禮服，軟領，熨貼的領結。他枯坐在那裹，如老僧入定，幾乎絲毫不動。他不做一個無謂的表情，不說一句廢話。他答復各種詢問，都切中要害，有時簡潔而且含蓄。</p>
<p>他的頭髮，比較四年前我看見他的時候，更加蒼白稀疏，但那是無關緊要的。從彼時起，他還向紐約聽衆作最後一次獻藝，紐約無綫電中心雷電華城並在兩年前把他鋼琴獨奏節目，播送到全世界數百萬聽衆的耳鼓裏。此刻他若老當益壯，重振舊調，自然不足為異。並且人們在欣嘗他的藝術前，還可聆聽他的演說呢。</p>
<p>我還記得一九一六年那年，第一次歐戰方興未艾。派特魯斯基週遊美國各州，一面演奏鋼琴，一面為波蘭獨立自由乞援。他在打開鋼琴，演奏波蘭大作曲家孝賓雄壯的樂譜前，曾用政治家的口才，樂台皇帝的氣宇，發表動人的演說。這篇演說稿，是他和顧問秘書們，費了一夜功夫寫成的，現巳成為歷史性的文獻。世上再沒有像他一般莊嚴和富於戲劇性的人物了。他的聲音（聽衆們未之前聞）和他溫雅堅毅的態度，相得益彰，好像從他的音樂中流露出來的一般。</p>
<p>派特魯斯基，依稀仍是當年人物，只是蒼老一些，衰弱一些，但無損於他藝術和人品的偉大。他的偉大和謙恭，在他的談吐之間隨時流露着。</p>
<p>我曾向他問，「大藝術家和大政治家，何者有功於人類？」</p>
<p>他本可抓住大好機會，醜詆政治家，而把藝術家的超凡入聖，抬上三十六天。然而他不願出此。政治家也好，藝術家也好。像他這樣一個有裨於邦國的偉人，總是不可或缺的。</p>
<p>又有一次我問他，這許多年的政治工作和音樂生活，使他功成名顯，是否巳償夙願？他的回答使我深刻不忘，他說「我只能對你說：我已打了幾次大仗。」</p>
<p>他繼續着打仗，現在是個坐守成敗的人了。他的體力巳衰，不比壯年時代的孔武有力。當年他任內閣總理時代，某天晚上，有一個刺客闖進他的屋子，一手拿着手槍，一手拿着辭職書，强逼他簽字。他起先假意服從，撲到刺客驀然間的身上，擊落敵人的手槍，他的妻子被噪聲驚動，進來察看究竟，只見她的丈夫把一個陌生人的頭顱在牆壁上猛撞呢。</p>
<p>壯年時代慷慨慇懃的派特魯斯基，現在已變成凝神默思的長者。他對人常常謙恭有禮，善於揣度別人心理。他不僅怠於表情，旦不浪費脣舌。有時為省力起見，他只說出一個中心題目，讓他的秘書史脫拉加慈詳細演繹他的意思。</p>
<p>「你可以想像，我必需為波蘭宣勞，」他從容不迫地對我說，「但波蘭的需要與整個世界的需要，不可分離，這是衆所共曉的。極權主義必須打倒，自由和自治政府必須恢復。除非此事見諸事實，一切都是空談！」</p>
<p>附錄：派特魯斯基一生大事記：</p>

<p>一八六三年，三歲，始學鋼琴。</p>

<p>一八八三年，赴柏林學習鋼琴及作曲。</p>
<p>一八八七年，在維也納舉行第一次鋼琴獨奏，獲得初次成功。</p>
<p>一八八八年，首度赴美國奏藝，載譽而歸。此後游歷美國先後共達十八次。歐洲，南北美洲，澳洲，紐西蘭及南菲洲各大城市，無不有其足跡。</p>
<p>一八九九年，與海倫特露新女士結婚，感情彌篤。夫人對其藝術上與政治上的成就，堪稱賢內助，於一九三四年逝世。</p>
<p>一九〇九年，任華沙音樂院院長。</p>
<p>一九一六年，歐戰進行中，在美國各地從事波蘭難民救濟運動。</p>
<p>一九一七年，開始政治生活，在美國組織波蘭志願軍，推進復國運動，被任為波蘭駐華盛頓代表。</p>
<p>一九一八年，波蘭復國，返國任第一屆內閣總理，並出席凡爾賽和平會議及國際聯合會。</p>
<p>一九二〇年，退出政治舞台，重操藝術生涯，以瑞士與美國為常住之所。</p>
<p>一九四〇年，波蘭戰敗，政府遷往巴黎，當　總統，再度奔走復國運動。</p>
<p>一九四一年六月卅日，病歿紐約。年八十一，遺骸暫葬西林頓塋地，俟戰後運返波蘭</p>
<p>派特魯斯基為世界最榮譽的鋼琴家，生前獲得世界各國的優禮。他保有英，法，比，義各國勳章，波蘭復國白　勳章，選法蘭西學院，美國文藝學院，義大利聖丹西西利學院，並獲得耶魯，牛津，哥倫比亞等十個著名大學名譽博士學位。</p>

<h3>香港設領的史料</h3>
<p>— 由義</p>
<p>（本報香港通訊）　中國與英國交涉在香港設置領事，已經有五十年的歷史了，在前淸光緒年間，便已有過兩度的談判，可是因為種種原因，始終沒有結果，直到這次新任外長郭泰祺回國，才算把這項交涉，原則上商得了結果。在懸案很久的中緬劃界結束以後，香港設領問題，得以連帶解決，這是中英外交史上展開了新的一頁。日前重慶哈瓦斯電傳，首任駐港總領，將以刁作謙氏充任。茲將香港設領交涉史料和刁氏略歷，分述如次：</p>
<p>交涉了五十年</p>
<p>五十年來香港設領的交涉始終沒有結果，近四年間香港人口不斷的激增，由七十多萬而增至一百餘萬，這總數的百分之九十幾是中國人，而且它在遠東的地位，是僅次於新加坡。但對中國而言，它比新加坡是更為重要；在經濟上，更成為中國重要據點，國際交通路綫的重心，更加增加助長它的繁榮。因此，中國設領一事，最近交涉，日有成功的可能，這是主要因素。此事在今年以來，由中英兩方代表積極談判，而已由新任外交部長郭泰祺氏在離英之前，與英當局接洽妥當，大約這回是會成為事實了。</p>
<p>曾紀澤的努力</p>
<p>最初的一次，我交涉的代表人是曾紀澤氏（曾惠敏公）。曾氏經幾度交涉，卒無效果，因英國旣不願中國設領，但又無辭足以拒絕，故只有以空辭遷延時日，結果自然是沒有辦法，而流產了。在薛福成出使英。法·義，比四國日記上，有這樣的一段紀述：</p>
<p>「曾惠敏公擬設香港領事，行文數次，英國外部以咨藩部為辭，藩部以官民不便為說，管禿唇焦，終無成議」。</p>
<p>薛福成的爭持</p>
<p>繼後，薛福成氏也曾着力交涉，因薛氏當時是欽差出使大臣，出使英·法·義，比四國，是適當的參與其事的人。最初引起他對香港設領事館的注意的，是光緒十六年（一八九零）五月十四日的總理衙門（淸朝負外交職責的最高機關）的咨文，請他向英國外部商議中國在新加坡附近英屬各島設立領事。因此，他想起香港設置領事館的重要，及決定交涉辦法。他以為「設立一處，商議一處，枝枝節節，徒費脣舌，向難確有把握」，但是有什麽辦法可達到這個目的呢？於是「英文參贊馬格里（淸臣）請先辦文照會外部，援照公法及各國常例，聲明中國可派領事分駐英國屬境，暫不必指明何地，且日本，暹邏皆已有領事在香港，而彼獨堅拒中國，本不公允，今但典之泛論通例，彼必無辭以難我，一經答允，則無論何處領事，惟我所派矣」。薛氏以為適當，因屬馬參贊代擬英文照會，而於光緒十六年八月十三日遞送至英國外交部，裏面所持的理由，是：</p>
<p>（一）「中國雖尙未將內地各地盡准西人通商，然即中國所做之事論之，亦足令中國有請准設領事官駐紮英地之理，中國是以望英國允派領事宜駐紥英地，照英國許各友邦領事官分駐之例辦理」。</p>
<p>（二）「中國有二十餘處地方准令外國人民居住經商，其收稅之輕，為各有約之別國所未有，計有二十一處，英國會派領事官駐紥其地」。</p>
<p>（三）「一千八百七十八年，貴爵部堂繕寫照會時，烟臺條約，尙未核准，內巳言中國有派領事官至英地之權；又一千八百六十多年十月二十四日條約中，曾明言英國願認中國有派領事官至英國各地之權，此約雖未經照行；……英廷巳早有允設中國領事官之意：」。</p>
<p>至十六日，薛氏遣參贊馬淸臣至英國外交部探問南洋各島設領事官之事，據淸臣與外次山特生談話，可分析如下：</p>
<p>山特生的意見：（一）「中英和約，究無中國在英境設領事之明文，所以從前議此事者，每多阻碍」；（二）「香港逼近廣東，盡係華人所居，若現設華官，難免喧賓奪主之虞」；（三）「中國風氣初開，恐在領事官者，不自知其職守，有侵權越分之舉」。</p>
<p>淸臣的意見：（一）「和約有准英國在中國設領事之明文，舉此見彼，原是一律，若必一一詳載，則約文未免太繁」；（二）「日本，暹邏皆已有領事在香港，而獨不許中國，此理殊難解釋，凡於理說不去者，即於勢不可行」；（三）「新加坡領事左秉隆……熟習華洋情事，辦理恰如分量，遠近均無間言，若香港設中國領事，聞當調左秉隆在之，開辦一切，必可如法」。</p>
<p>這次交涉，中心是兩個，一是新加坡附近各島設領，而新加坡改設總領事，以統轄之，這是總理衙鬥的意思，二是香港設領，這是薛氏的意思，而尤是這次交涉的着重點。</p>
<p>再後，到十月十九日，始接到英國外部照會，原文如下：</p>
<p>「為照會事，照得本爵部堂接准貴大臣西九月二十三日來文內開：</p>
<p>中朝欲派領事官駐紥英地等因，此事巳經英廷細心審量，今本爵部堂極喜吿知貴大臣，英廷願給文憑與中國所派之領事官，如給與外洋各友邦之領事官同樣辦理，但間有審量地方情形之處，刻下或有不能照給文憑者，此須由英廷察看情景定奪辦理。相應照會貴大臣，請煩查照，須至照會者，一千八百九十年十一月二十九日，自外部衙門發。」</p>
<p>這裏所說的「問有審量地方情形之處」的地方，指的是新金山，而不是香港，於是在二十日，薛氏「乃照復外部，稱其辦事之公道，且吿以中國應派之領事官，首在香港及新加坡附近之地，今已選得二員，候總理衙門核定。此二員者，歷練有識，持已謹嚴，接物和平，允堪勝任。駐香港者，擬調新加坡領事左秉隆任之，駐新加坡者，擬派使署二等參贊黃遵憲任之，非僅為新加披一處之領事官，並為檳榔嶼麻六甲及附近各處領事官，其檳榔嶼各處有應選派副領事者，俟審定後，再當奉聞。」</p>
<p>再過幾天，英「外部照會，稱已領悉，並無異言」，薛氏認為「此事大局遂定矣。」</p>
<p>總觀當時薛氏爭取香港設立領事館的根本原因，是「香港一區，尤為中外往來之咽喉，凡華洋各商貨物，均先至香港，然後轉運各省，而交涉事物之緊要者，一曰逃犯，一曰走私，一曰海界，粵省每出巨案，派員至港，祇以未設領事，聲氣陷絕，動多扞格。此處添設領事，萬不可緩。」</p>
<p>作為「大局遂定」的香港設領，後來事實吿訴我們，是成為泡影了。</p>
<p>在近年來，新中國建立起來了，因着英美蘇的不斷援助，邦交呈現前所未有的敦睦，這時的香港，已是中國國際通路的一個重心，人口已增加到一百數十萬，其中有百分之九十幾是中國人；中國在香港設立領事館，已是迫切需要的，而英國也覺得中國不再需要太懷疑了。中英邦交一日日的緊密起來，於是經過多時談判後，尤其在新任的個長郭泰祺氏離英前，已與英國當局商議，已有成效，而且領館組織已擬定為總領事一人，副領事一人，隨習領事四人。</p>
<p>首任港領人選</p>
<p>刁作謙，字成章，廣東興寗人，十歲隨父至檀香山，其後來滬求學，畢業於聖約翰大學，繼復赴英，入劍橋大學，得文學碩士及法學博士學位，曾充中國留英學生監督。宣統二年歸國，應留學生考試，給進士授翰林。辛亥革命，充英文北京日報主筆，歷任外部秘書，繼調駐英使館參贊，淸華大學校長，駐古巴公使，巴拿馬公使，新加坡總領事等職。刁好運動尤擅綱球，重慶電傳亦曾有任駐澳公使說，最近始傳將出任首任駐港總領，姑誌之以待證實。</p>

<h3>紗市大落　棉銷減色</h3>
<p>現棉情况本屬挺括、無奈紗市大落、致人心帶疲、然執貨者價格如廉、絕無放手脫售之念、所以交易較爲减色也、</p>

<p>粉市初疲後堅</p>
<p>昨日現洋粉初疲後堅、晨間開市因實銷不振、頗形萎頓、金龍粉開盤僅三十二元六角、砲臺粉三十三元六角、但不久忽有利多消息、兼聞米市轉堅、人心復好、本客實銷幫及做心思者、相繼收買、金龍粉由三十二元六角而七角八角九角全二十三元一角、砲臺粉婁時亦加二角至三十三元八角、結果比上日反緊一二角、尙有鐘樓牌開過三十四元、及尺燕牌三十三元、均吿平穩、成交一萬五六千包、市面脚地尙隱、</p>

<p>希特勒圖利用日本　沙遜又稱、渠不信美日兩國有開戰可能、蓋日本政府對美、審慎將事、且知德國若對蘇戰勝、而與日本爲鄰時、日本有與美國結盟之可能也、希特勒亟需日本之海軍、願予日本以共所要求之任何諾言、不論荷印·澳洲·印度與越南、希特勒皆願允許日本涉足、但求日本助以海軍爲報、</p>
<p>所謀若遂又將侵日但希特勒若遂其擊敗美國之願後、將轉向日本用武、渠信日本未爲希特勒所愚、而日本僅因目下於本身相宜、始對德訂的、去歲十二月渠卽知蘇德關係將破裂、時日政府巳接德蘇決裂、將於八月或九月實現之情報、不意希特勒再度變計、而對蘇決裂、竟較衆料者更爲迅速、</p>

<h3>兩位可愛的災童　敬向社會呼籲　已考入立達學園免費生　敬求各界資助膳宿等費</h3>
<p>接到法租界居爾典路二百八十五號災童敎養所兩位小學生的來信，文筆活潑，可憐可愛。一名倪兆祺，十四歲，鎭江籍；名包家增，十四歲，嘉定人。都是戰後故鄉淪咱，流浪到上海，經人介紹入災童敎養所，今夏暑期已經畢業，目巳考入了立達學園的淸寒免費生額。但學費雖免，書籍膳宿及雜費等，為數亦相當　觀。兩生貧苦無依，而好學求進之心，殊可愛憐。特向社會呼籲，請求援助。如蒙熱心人士賜予同情，解囊資助，本報當樂予代收，轉交兩生，以竟其志。茲將倪生兆祺來信，照刊如下：熱忱的編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是　個受了戰爭影響而遭難的災童。</p>
<p>自從鎮江被烽火燒毀後，我便隨看雙親兄弟姊妹們，淚別了錦繡的故鄉的懷抱，而飄泊於上海。從此家中經濟便窘迫異常，幸得慈善家的幫助，而介紹到上海災童敎養所去求學，因此我又能得到良好的敎養，好像又走上了段新生的旅途，這是我在不幸中而得到的安慰。</p>
<p>光陰滴在流水裏，一點水珠都小濺起，匆匆開畢業期已到了，於是又有一個更要緊，更難解决的問題，壓抑着我幼稚的天眞的好動的心頭！在近幾日內，－四歲的我，好似又長大了幾歲；草塲上跳的影子，跑的影子，活動的影子，全不見了，祗是浸在沉默裏思案中了。我為什麽要整日憂愁煩悶呢？為的是本所不辦中學，父母錢袋父空空，我小學畢業後，有誰米供給我升中學去呢？至於去就菜吧，憑我的淺底的知識和經騐，能够到那兒去討一碗飯來充實自已的肚子呢？所以我的小心是受到人間創傷悲痛而　淚了！</p>
<p>我的腦海中，常常道樣想：我旣是　個災童，茫茫然的前途，當然不免要有　錢的波擊，不過我總不要畏怯自餒，仍要鼓動勇氣，想個完善的方法來解脫這余錢的束縛，勇往直前，前途自然會光明的。</p>
<p>我的學費可不成問題了，因為我一考取立達學園的淸寒免費生的學額，但還有許多書籍費，膳宿費等等的費用，無力繳納，本所因經濟缺乏，對於畢業生一切雜費一概不幫助，所以還需懇乞社會上熱心的先生們生測隱之心，救濟我災童，我現在好似海中失舵的船，在中途徬徨着，眼見前途有成就，而不能航行　進，不能划到允明的境地去，多麼可惜！多麽値得人家憐憫而歎惜啊！</p>
<p>我在仰企着頭，仲着手，誠懇地求貴報館培養我，使我　涂芬芳燦爛圓滿，準備將來獻身於祖國。</p>
<p>我在靜候着佳音呢？敬祝編輯先生夏安！並祝工作勝　！！</p>
<p>災童敎養所災童倪兆祺，立正致敬。</p>
<p>又包家增，籍貫江蘇嘉定，年十四，戰事後，家鄕淪陷，父母失散，流浪上海，經人介紹入災童敎養所。今夏畢業，亦已考入立達學園的淸寒免費生，但因缺乏書　膳宿等費，請求各界賜予援助。</p>

<p>社會</p>
<h3>美國徵兵的喜劇  華志</h3>
<p>美國實行徵兵制以來，全國幾千個微兵所中，發生了無數趣劇。這些趣劇，有的情有可原，有的荒唐不經。足以代表美國國民性的一斑。茲摘錄</p>
<p>各地徵兵所對於體格健全的男子，果然歡迎之不暇，但對城不健全的男子，是享以閉門漢的、對付這些不自量力的應微者，有時非常棘手。某次有一個軍官，怒氣冲冲的闖進當地徵兵所，聞地們爲什麼把一個患着門雞眼，疝氣和部份麻痺症的人，送到軍營裏。那惶悚的微兵所長答道，這是他打發殘廢離所的惟一方法，免得此人苦苦要求入伍呀。，</p>
<p>有許多自作聰明的男子，在徵兵令頒佈而尙未有效的時候，趕緊結婚，以爲他有家庭的負担，就有谿免兵役的權利；可是結婚之後，發現家庭生活，不逮軍隊生活遠甚，願意立即入伍。微兵所裏不時接到一般妻子索取丈夫的信，內容是：「執事先生大鑒：妾與夫結褵，原期同偕白首。乃事隔未久，夫忽出亡軍隊。請將其交回爲感。」</p>
<p>遠在軍役年齡以下的孩子們，執意要入伍，也是一個難題。某徵兵所長質問一僩應徵的孩子道：「你的家長聽得你要出亡的消息，將說些什麼呢？」那孩子尷尬着而孔答道：「他們准會說：去罷，小東西!」　又有一個靑年，因爲須贍養母親，拒絕入伍。徵兵所傳到他的母親，請她證明他可以當兵。「我曾經當過敎員」，他的母親侃侃而談道，一此刻我還可以我一個工作過活。」這樣一來，徵兵所裏的人倒沒有辦法，只得命那個靑年留在家裹，至少等他母親找到了職業再說。</p>
<p>又有一個多妻主義者，他不願贍　第一第二兩個妻子和他們的孩子，而把第三個妻子，列爲倚靠者。第本個妻子便被傅到時徵兵所，證明他的話是吾確實。她遲疑了一響答道：「不，他連我也不贍養。」</p>
<p>跳舞家的入伍，在徵兵所中也成爲問題。舞藝家們聲稱，他的美妙舞趾，一穿軍用皮靴，便要失去效用。但當局認爲這不是充足的理由。只有一個滑稽跳舞家，因他的女伴藉賣藝贍養家庭，他若應微，她的生活便要陷於困境，徵兵所中便把他豁免了。</p>
<p>智識界中人不滿微兵的，亦復少。有一個和平主義者，聽得叫他當兵的消息，勃然大怒，碰着桌子道：「倘使你們不豁免我，我就耍向法院控訴，我要親自向總統聲訴，我要奮鬥，爲我的權利奮鬥。一</p>
<p>還有一個反對主義者，因鑒於俄國大革命時的種種慘劇，決定避免一切軍畫行動。他用打字機打了二十面的大文，向微兵人員訴說他托爾斯泰式的和戰道理。還有一位和平家，眼光更爲遠大，他說他信奉中國的道敎，要無爲自化。入聖超凡。</p>
<p>唐人街的許多中國未婚靑年，不能捏稱在中國有倚靠者以求豁免，大都服貼貼的應徵了。在陸軍當局，原存心提拔他們，但他們苦心經營的洗衣作和小吃店，倒反而因經營乏人，要關門大吉。有個自作聰明的華僑，不願放棄生意興隆的洗衣作，他向徵兵所人員說道，「我不會講美國話。」可惜事前他已用很好的英語，答復體格檢查員的問話，此刻再要躱避，巳太遲了。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>寂寞</h3>
<p>— 蘭紋</p>
<p>消沉的日子使生活變得麻木，麻木的生活顯得日子更加消沉。於是什麼也都完了。自己忘却了別人，別人也忘却了自己。甚至連自己也忘却了自已。</p>
<p>不幸的是現實多刺，白時也還記得自己是活在這樣的地方，這樣的時代。於是也仍不免有所感觸與思維。論理地說來，這該算是有幸的。</p>
<p>但，寂寞的影子還是那樣熟悉。寂寞竟是年輕人不可免的命運嗎？</p>
<p>有　朋友懷着「做點事情」的心情，跑了許多地方，身上沾滿了異鄉的塵土。他從這裏跑到那里，從遙遠奔向更遙遠。家園的夢也愈益遙長了。</p>
<p>一點理想的光；驅使着他，終於忘記了自己，忘記了過去。他吃苦，他耐勞；不求名不求利。所有的就是那份「做點事情」的心情。這也在稍嫌微薄，但你能說他不切實嗎？</p>
<p>然而，迎接他的是太多的磨折和阻撓。一個堅毅的人或者知道怎樣來回擊與制勝；不幸上帝造人的時候偶有疏忽：忘了毫無偏私地賜給人人以堅毅，如耳目口鼻。而遺傳却留給人們一種不算可愛的惰性。它使人懂得了甚麼叫厭倦。厭倦生活。於是靜下來，沉默了</p>
<p>征空跨海，朋友父歸來了。洋塲的熱鬧已隨年歲增長，繁華勝於昔日。但，聰明的先生，你說他能吿訴我些什麼，我父能吿訴他些什麼呢？相對久坐，我們像已都知道得頗多了。而夏夜却是更短促了呢！</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>輸血入骨</h3>
<p>— 修</p>
<p>據最近的報吿，血液能輸入骨髓，和接在血管中一樣。若干醫師曾替十四位病人，用這種新法試騐輸血十七次，其中祇有决效果不佳。</p>
<p>那些醫師說：注入骨髓的液質，能流到血中去，看林子顯　不生變化，而且和直接注入血管的液質，差不多流得一樣快。</p>
<p>骨中的空管並非就能代替血，作爲血液或別　液質被管注人病人的身體以後的流動的孔道。不過有時醫師若要將液質注人血管，感覺困難，或渚根本無法注射。譬如病人創口累累，遍體火傷，皮肉浮腫，突受震激，血管的發育本來不佳或者血管閉塞。在這等情形之下，骨髓輸血法也許能起死回生。嬰孩們的血管，大抵發育不佳，以致醫師們不容易或者簡直無法施行靜脈注射。</p>
<h3>活動地下室</h3>
<p>— 增修</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>

<p>話還沒有說完，淚珠巳打他的眼眶裏像泉水一樣的湧出來了。</p>
<p>秋海棠竭力把視綫避開去，嘴角上發出了淡淡的一笑。、</p>
<p>「你是孩子家，不能吃苦；我呢，年紀這麼大了，再苦一些也熬得住。這倒用不到你担心的。」</p>
<p>「不，這種話我不相信，人家從來不是這樣的！」梅寳很倔强地說。</p>
<p>「孩子，乖ｇ　些吧，你只要聽我的話，就是啦！」秋海棠還是照例用這一套話來回答她。「反正是我自己要這樣疼你的。該吃些什麽，穿些什麼，你又從來不曾和我吵過。孩子，相信我吧！我自己願意熬一些苦，完全不是爲了你！」</p>
<p>「別說下去了，爸爸，又是這麼一套老曲子！梅寳呶起着一張小嘴說。</p>
<p>現在，他們巳快走進屯口了。梅寳偶然望</p>
<p>免患濕溫及疰夏之苦　號</p>
<p>後面一看，只見住在他家左邊的十歲的小朋友梅如春，正赤着一雙泥腿，在大雨裏在奔着，混身淋得像一頭落湯雞一樣。</p>
<p>「爸爸你待我太好了！」她瞧着自己身上完全乾燥的衣服，情感極度衝動地說。</p>
<p>「不，孩子，我是應該待你這樣好的。你在別處一定會比這裏快活得多咧……！」秋海棠差一些就要把心頭所蘊藏着的秘密對他女兒傾吐出來，但終於竭力忍住了。</p>
<p>不幸梅寳是個絕頂聰明的孩子，雖然只聽到這麼很含糊的一句話，心上便立刻擁起了一團疑雲。</p>
<p>「在別處？爸爸，我不跟你在一塊兒，再能上什麽地方去呢？你的話眞奇怪！」她睜圓了一雙眼睛，牢牢地看定着秋海棠的高低不平的臉龐，彷彿要從那兩道創痕裏面，看出她父親的秘密來。</p>
<p>「你本來是可以上你媽那兒去的。」秋海棠望了一望天空裏的雨勢，不很經心地說。（一五六）</p>

<h3>戰時的蘇聯影業</h3>
<p>— 金川</p>
<p>一家攝影塲佔地有四方英里。其他影業重要地如列寗格勒，巴庫及裏海附近各城。蘇聯的影業相當發達，有許多設備也都採自美德二國。單莫斯科一處就有影院五百家，其中二百家放映敎育電影，完全免費。蘇聯影界也極力向好萊塢學習，每年都派有許多專家和製片家到好萊塢去參觀考察。但雖然如此，他們却覺得好萊塢應向他們學習的地方更多呢。他們自謂不論在藝術的或商業的價値上，蘇聯影片都遠超過好萊塢的出品。</p>
<p>但在蘇聯的影都里可沒有一多少多少萬薪俸的人，沒有誰像克拉克蓋博或嘉寳那樣週薪高至一千鎊。不過話又得說回來，如果誰以為蘇聯影界工作人員的薪俸完全是一律的，那也是大錯。在蘇聯每個工人都能找到工作是事實，但工資的大小却視工作的性質而定的。普通一個電氣師，錄音師等每月可得二百盧布，行政負責人員和明星等每月可拿到一千五百盧布。以上是戰前的大槪情形，戰後當然有些不同了。</p>
<h3>評中旅的「雷雨」</h3>
<p>— 沙飛</p>
<p>曹禺的「雷雨」這一個四幕大悲劇，賺人眼淚的故事，是婦孺皆知的，自然也毋須我再來介紹。只是此次中旅在天蟾演出，唐若靑因華年合同關係，不能登台，陣容方面，略有更動，演員的支配是：孫景璐的四鳳，唐槐秋的周樸園，葛鑫的魯貴，仇銓的魯大海，吳景平的周冲，夏多文的周蘩漪，張雪梅的魯侍萍，趙恕的周萍。</p>
<p>這一張鐘意，我覺得他不怎樣均衡，水準的高低，相差太遠，演技的成績，也有天壤之別，好的真好，使你佩服得說不出話來，壞的真壞，使你氣悶得　不過氣來。</p>
<p>孫景璐的四鳳，一出塲，就是滿口柔甜淸脆的國語，她從第一幕到第四幕，始終是抓住觀眾的一顆心的，她的臉部表情，舉止態度，都自然，活潑。唐槐秋的周樸園，從台後出來的時候，就有特殊的風格，那條左手呆呆地，身子硬硬的，給人是一種輕鬆的刺激。葛鑫的魯貴，演來很盡職，不過似乎還不夠在個性上舒暢的表顯；我們知道，魯貴在曹禺的筆底下，是一個又陰險，又俏皮，又糊塗，又會拍馬吹牛，又要欺弱附强的混蛋，葛鑫的表情，只是浮面的，以前我看過王獻齊的魯貴，就比他强得多深刻多了。仇銓的魯大海，很合身份，傻頭傻腦，而是一腔熱血，滿懷勇氣，他出塲以後，最能把觀眾注意力集中起來。吳景平的周冲，缺少天真而且近乎呆板。夏多文的周蘩漪完全是模仿唐若靑的作風，她對於這一角色，自始至終都不肯鬆弛一步，可惜過於冷靜沉悶。張雪梅的魯侍萍，只看見她在台上走來走去，而並沒看見她有甚麽內心的表情，其實這一角色，也是極容易討好觀眾的。趙恕的周萍，扮相太年輕，唸台詞的聲調不夠，並且動作也嫌生硬。效果方面，因為戲台太大的緣故，未能逼真，只是幾聲狗叫，還　使人悠然神往。</p>

<h3>Chinese Ambassador to England, Gu Weijun, Meets with the British King to Present Credentials, Gu Holds Reception at the Embassy, China's Four Years of Warfare Highly Praised by the British</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th – Chinese Ambassador to England, Gu Weijun, yesterday met with the British King to present his credentials. British Foreign Secretary Eden was also present. Ambassador Gu also led eight people, including Chinese Embassy Counselors Yu Ming, Shi Zhaokui, and First Secretary, in meeting with the King.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th – After the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to England, Dr. Gu Weijun, arrived here, Graves, who served as the foreign news editor of The Times for many years, said at the embassy's reception: "We deeply admire and are extremely grateful to your government and people. Your country's warfare has greatly assisted Britain and the English-speaking people in general. If the Chinese government had advocated prudence and appeasement at the beginning of the China Incident, I fear that militaristic Japan, emboldened by China's surrender, would not have been willing to remain subservient. Although the South Seas are still in grave danger, Japan's blade has been dulled, and the weapons it uses are no longer as sharp as they were four years ago. We welcome Your Excellency as the representative of a great ancient country that is now waging the same war as us in pursuit of fairness, order, and fidelity in international relations." Zhang Xuelou, former Far East Manager of Reuters and an old friend of Dr. Gu, also gave a speech, saying, "I first met Dr. Gu in Nanjing in 1931. At that time, when the national affairs were critical, Dr. Gu disregarded his own danger and took on the difficult task of Chinese Foreign Minister under the order of Chairman Chiang. The following spring, I accompanied Dr. Gu to the three northeastern provinces. Dr. Gu, as the representative of the Chinese government, accompanied the League of Nations investigation team to the three northeastern provinces to conduct an unappreciated and ultimately fruitless investigation. I still remember Dr. Gu's indomitable posture in the streets of Fengtian, serving the country with a fearless spirit in an environment surrounded by malicious gazes. We are fortunate to have such a prominent diplomat representing China in London, and at the same time, we have our close friend Dr. Guo Taiqi as the Chinese Foreign Minister in Chongqing. We deeply believe that this will be a solid bridge of friendship and understanding between the two major capitals and the two major democracies."</p>
<h3>American Journalist Ingersoll to Visit China</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 11th – Ingersoll, former editor of "Time" magazine and now the owner of the New York "PM" newspaper, flew to San Francisco yesterday and will transfer to a ship to Honolulu, then fly to Chongqing, Moscow, and London. He has scheduled meetings with Chairman Chiang, Stalin, and Churchill. Ingersoll said he will reside in Chongqing for a week to investigate the military and the morale of the people. Since Britain is resisting the German army in the English Channel and China is resisting the Japanese army in the inland day after day, the United States must take responsibility to immediately send effective assistance to defeat the invading countries. Ingersoll has met with President Roosevelt and Dr. Cooley. The trip is scheduled to arrive in Rangoon on July 28.</p>
<h3>Mines Placed in San Francisco Waterway</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 11th – The Navy Department announced yesterday that mines were placed in the waterway near San Francisco Bay on June 28. This condition will continue indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Chen Jie Returns from Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 11th – The German official news agency reported that the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Chen Jie, left the German capital last night with his entourage for Switzerland, and will return to Chongqing via the United States.</p>
<h3>Icelandic Parliament Approves U.S. Navy Garrison, Hoping U.S. Will Recognize Iceland's Freedom and Sovereignty Like Britain</h3>
<p>United Press, Reykjavik, 11th – The Icelandic Parliament yesterday approved the agreement between the government and the United States by a vote of 49 to 3. The agreement stipulates that the United States assumes the responsibility of protecting Iceland by military means. Those who voted against were all communists. The resolution passed by the Icelandic Parliament reads as follows: "The Icelandic Parliament approves the agreement between the Icelandic government and the United States government, stipulating that the United States shall be responsible for protecting Iceland by force during this war." At the same time, it is reported that the Regent of Iceland met with senior U.S. Army and Navy officers commanding the U.S. troops here on Wednesday. Yesterday, personnel from U.S. warships and supply ships, as well as aviators and troops, gathered in the streets here, buying souvenirs and surrounding the doors of various candy stores and ice cream parlors in heavy rain. Prime Minister Jónasson convened a special meeting of Parliament to report on the transfer of the right to occupy Iceland by force from Britain to the United States. Jónasson said that the British government, in its reply to him, stated that it recognized Iceland's sovereign independence and other rights under the peace treaty. It also stated that Britain would withdraw all British troops as soon as the United States had sufficient troops stationed in Iceland. Britain also agreed to increase trade with Iceland instead of reducing it. Mr. Jónasson also said that Iceland had requested Britain to release seven civilians detained in England. Finally, Britain has recognized that under the new procedures, the previous British declaration regarding the recognition of Iceland's free sovereignty has not changed, and both countries have agreed to be bound by their current diplomatic relations. Mr. Jónasson praised the good behavior of the British troops during their occupation of Iceland, and he dared to assert that the American soldiers would also be extremely satisfactory.</p>
<h3>U.S. Isolationist Senator Criticizes the Trusteeship of Iceland, Saying "This is No Different from a War of Aggression"</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 11th – Ohio Republican Senator Taft declared yesterday that a few weeks ago, "reliable authorities" had told him that the United States was building a naval and air base for Britain in Northern Ireland. Taft criticized the U.S. military occupation of Iceland, saying that the United States could use the same excuse to send troops to Ireland, Scotland, England, or Portugal. He also said that the above countries are very close to Iceland, and we will now be forced to protect a soldier already in Iceland. The U.S. military occupation of Iceland may allow 500,000 British troops to be transferred to other services, with 500,000 U.S. troops replacing them. If the U.S. military obtains a base in Ireland, it will be more effective in protecting British shipping than Iceland." Taft also said that he protested against the U.S. occupation of Iceland. If this policy continues, "Congress's constitutional right to declare war will become useless." Taft, a leading isolationist senator, said that President Roosevelt only has the right to take action to protect the U.S. mainland and has no right to launch a war of aggression. He also said that the occupation of Iceland is no different from a war of aggression. He has now sent 80,000 soldiers deep into the center of a foreign war zone." Taft ridiculed the view that Germany would attack the United States, saying that if the Nazis controlled the entire European naval line and the British Isles, the 80,000 U.S. troops in Iceland would only be a burden to the United States because "we cannot send a fleet to the Arctic Circle to protect them. At that time, we will lose all 80,000 soldiers in Iceland."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 11th – North Dakota Republican Senator Nye yesterday attacked the U.S. entry into Iceland. Nye, a staunch isolationist, said in the Senate, "Our leaders seem impatient because we have not been attacked." Referring to British Prime Minister Churchill's criticism of Senator Wheeler for prematurely announcing that U.S. troops would occupy Iceland, Nye declared, "It is disturbing that a foreign leader should criticize an American like Mr. Wheeler. In fact, Churchill seems to think we are his colony." Churchill's criticism of Wheeler's announcement was because it could endanger the lives of British troops withdrawing from Iceland.</p>
<h3>Peru and Ecuador Send Representatives to the United States to Negotiate Peace, Peruvian Cabinet Agrees to Peaceful Resolution, Mexico Sends Note to Both Countries</h3>
<p>United Press, Miami, 11th – Two special envoys representing Peru and Ecuador arrived here last night and will travel to Washington to meet with U.S. officials to discuss a resolution to the border conflict that began last Saturday. The arrival of Dr. Concha, former Peruvian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Eighth Pan-American Conference, was expected, but the arrival of Rafael, the special envoy representing Ecuador, on the same U.S. plane was unexpected. Both representatives declined to comment on the recent conflict caused by the old border dispute.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Capital of Chile, 11th – According to news from the capital of Peru, the Peruvian cabinet held a cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon, which lasted a long time. It is reported that they have agreed to a peaceful resolution of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian conflict.</p>
<p>Havas, Mexico City, 10th – After the governments of the United States, Argentina, and Brazil requested Peru and Ecuador to cease fire, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent notes to both Peru and Ecuador to promote the acceptance of the three countries' proposal, which stated: "At this time of serious international situation, the border dispute between Peru and Ecuador should be resolved quickly, so that the unity of the countries in the pan-American region can be clearly demonstrated."</p>
<h3>U.S. Has No Intention of Seeking Overseas Bases</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 11th – Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday answered questions from reporters based on Tokyo's broadcast news, saying that the United States does not want to seek naval and army bases in Portugal or Portuguese territories, or in Siberia. The external rumors are obviously German propaganda aimed at causing disputes between the United States and Japan. The broadcast news, reported by Tokyo newspapers, claimed that the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union are about to form an alliance, and the United States will establish military bases on the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Guo Visits British Ambassador</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Quietly Observing the Implementation of the Exchange Stabilization Plan</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Fox, a member of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, arrived in Shanghai, Shanghai's black foreign exchange market has suddenly fluctuated, rising and falling sharply. Many comments have been made in connection with this, some saying one thing is right, others saying another is right, and there is no time to discuss who is right and who is wrong. However, when it comes to foreign exchange, it is multifaceted and complex, and cannot be solved by a simple statement. Moreover, today's Shanghai foreign exchange, since it is called a black market, it is inevitably true to its name, and it is even more difficult to find a proper solution. As an old saying goes, "It is difficult to have everything." It is already difficult to have everything, and it is even more difficult to seek perfection in all aspects. Generally speaking, every matter is accompanied by both advantages and disadvantages, and the disadvantages arise from the advantages. Only when there are advantages do people want to cheat. Therefore, no matter how thorough the prevention of cheating is, and how grand the theory is, there are always things that cannot be erased in reality.</p>
<p>Since there is a so-called Exchange Equalization Fund, there must also be those that are unequal and inaccurate, so that they can be equalized and accurate. In countries with abundant production and vast income, perhaps there is more income than expenditure, and there is no need to equalize, but when there is too much income and gold is a problem, the nine-ren palace wall is visible but unreachable, and in the end, the wealth is seen as a disaster. Moreover, there are always differences in the types of goods, uneven distribution of natural resources, and differences in supply and demand. When there is a surplus in one place and a deficit in another, there must be clearing and adjustment. Naturally, there are differences in order and differences in level. As for when there is more outflow than inflow, it is necessary to use reserves, or borrow or owe. If there is no borrowing or owing, and no maintenance, it can be allowed to grow and perish on its own, but the loss of credit is unspeakable. Therefore, even if there is a barter system, and only a small amount of products are taken to offset the debt, it is still insufficient, and people want to obtain foreign exchange. As for how foreign exchange controls affect trade, there are many precedents in various countries. If those that are inconvenient are removed, those that are suitable for one place but not for another are improved. If there is no way to improve, prevent it, ban it, and remedy it, all of which are necessary, and it should not be abandoned because of choking, and say that banning and preventing it is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Matters cannot be generalized, nor can they be blindly followed. Generally speaking, public affairs should be approached with a public attitude, and private opinions should not be held. Today's Shanghai exchange market involves too much, and there are a thousand holes. It is not easy to remedy. With such a complex problem, one can only start from the bigger picture and should not speak from the smaller and nearer perspective. As soon as there is personal desire, there will be concealment, and what is seen will not be clear. The foreign exchange problem is related to national policy. The so-called national policy must be able to consider both the national economy and the people's livelihood, internal and external troubles, the advantages and disadvantages, and then decide what to do and how to proceed, with a clear and impartial mind. In recent years, whenever there have been financial measures, there have been movements in the market. The country has not yet seen its benefits, and the people have not yet received its benefits. Only those speculators who are quick-eared, quick-handed, and quick-footed can take the lead, make a fortune, become rich, and have full pockets. The problems that have arisen have made rumors often become facts, and there are even more rumors in the speculative market, and more people believe them. For example, just as Mr. Fox is about to travel from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Hong Kong has a message to maintain the British exchange rate at four pence one two five. Although it can be dismissed as a rumor, the rumor is even more determined by a specific number, which is incomparable to a baseless rumor. Today's foreign exchange is difficult, from the general hardship and difficulty of life, and the credit of the legal currency, we hope for its growth. However, if there is both clever acquisition and speculative absorption, if there is no control over foreign exchange purchases, the so-called legitimate needs, even those that meet the needs of the people's livelihood, and the illegal and unnecessary needs that do not meet the needs of the people's livelihood, are all mixed together, and there is no way to distinguish them. A short fall will only help the reverse trend, and people's hearts will waver. The wind of speculation and hoarding will become more prevalent, and the panic of life will be endless. This is not a blessing for the people's livelihood, nor is it beneficial to the national economy. Therefore, to what extent should it be maintained? After Mr. Fox came to Shanghai to investigate, he must have a plan in mind. Before there is a legal expression, there is no need to speculate. However, we hope that it will be done effectively to ensure that the legitimate needs of legitimate businesses are never ignored, and that foreign exchange should be supplied as much as possible, while the buying and selling of foreign exchange by speculators, as well as the arbitrage of conspirators, should be strictly banned, and effective measures should be taken to prevent them. This is exactly what the public is eagerly looking forward to, waiting for the results of the Hong Kong meeting, not only to stabilize the current foreign exchange, but also to have a profound impact on the future legal currency, commercial prosperity and decline, and the difficulty of people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Do Its Best to Assist China, Chinese Army to Launch Counteroffensive in the Autumn, Britain and the United States Pay Attention to Defending the Yunnan-Burma Road, Foreign Minister Guo is Very Optimistic About the War</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – According to an exclusive interview published in the Ta Kung Pao here, Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi declared, "President Roosevelt personally told me that the United States will do its best to assist us." Mr. Guo also said, "The United States will make the most of the Burma Road to transport military supplies to us. If Japan attacks Burma, the United States believes that this attack is as important as the invasion of Singapore." The British government is now paying considerable attention to the possibility of Japan invading Burma via Thailand. Mr. Guo believes that if there are sufficient defensive preparations, it will be difficult for Japan to carry out this attack, as the mountainous area along the Burmese-Thai border is the most difficult to engage in military operations. Mr. Guo announced that Britain and the United States will soon implement assistance to China to strengthen its air force strength in the future counterattack. He said, "Since the beginning of the Soviet-German war, Japan has encountered unprecedented isolation. Japan is now unable to defeat China, nor is it able to attack the Soviet Union or advance into the South China Sea. This has indirectly strengthened the strength of Britain and the United States in the region. Although Japan has threatened and intimidated, it has not achieved much in its negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. The only way for Japan to go is to increase its troops on the Chinese front, but our military strength increases with each battle. We are not afraid of Japan's final efforts, because the United States' support for China has become very certain. Chinese people here hope that they will soon be able to obtain Flying Fortresses, not only to assist the army in its large-scale counterattack, but also to bomb Japan. However, it is generally believed that these long-range bombers must be piloted by American volunteer pilots, because Chinese pilots, except for those trained in the United States, are not familiar with the complex mechanics of these giant aircraft. China is scheduled to launch a counteroffensive in the autumn, but it will depend on whether a large number of U.S. supplies arrive in the next three months and how the Burma Road, through which U.S. goods must pass, is in good condition." (11th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Guo Broadcasts to the Nation</p>
<p>Chongqing – Foreign Minister Guo broadcast to the nation on the Central Broadcasting Station at 7 p.m. on the 9th, entitled "International Anti-Aggression Front," which stated that when we mention international anti-aggression, we cannot help but feel a sense of pride. Four years ago, the forces of aggression began to rise, but many countries were not aware of it. Some were appeasing and tolerating, even indulging, thinking that it might be okay to compromise for a while to avoid disrupting the overall situation. Only we Chinese, under the leadership of our wise leader, recognized that aggressors would take an inch and want a mile, and that to safeguard international peace, justice, and human freedom and happiness, we could only strike the attackers at all costs. We did not covet temporary peace, nor were we limited to the so-called reality of the short-sighted, nor were we for the sake of one country or one time, harming our neighbors for our own benefit. Although we were fighting the strong with the weak, and although the powers at the time advised us to compromise and make concessions, we still raised the banner of justice and fired the shots of anti-aggression, determined not to foster enemies and leave troubles for future generations. We are the pioneers of anti-aggression, and the subsequent development of events and today's international situation prove that our understanding is absolutely correct. We can be proud to say that China is the vanguard of the anti-aggression movement in the world. In order to strengthen this hard-won international anti-aggression front so that it can fulfill its sacred mission, I would like to put forward the following two points: (1) Strengthen the organization of the front; (2) Firmly believe in victory. In these four years, we have adhered to our anti-aggression will, and have responded to all changes with the unchanging. The development of the international situation is just as we expected. All countries that love freedom and resist aggression have naturally stood on the same front. Looking back at Japan, it is becoming more and more panicked in its heart and more and more restless in its behavior. Every time it tries to take advantage of opportunities, it always ends up pleasing no one and failing in every attempt. Now we must seize this favorable opportunity, and with the warning of "halting after traveling ninety li out of a hundred," we must continue to struggle to achieve complete success. Final victory must belong to the anti-aggression side, that is, to us. But please remember that effort is the guarantee of success. (10th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Asks Britain to Launch a New Offensive Against the Nazis; Hopes to Establish a New War Zone to Achieve a Pincer Effect; and to Demonstrate its Determination and Sincerity in Aiding the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th. Stalin received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, today. This is the second time in three days that he has met with the British Ambassador. The two men conferred for an hour today, with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also present. Afterwards, the British Ambassador also met with the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. According to reliable sources from Moscow yesterday, the Soviet Union has requested that Britain launch an active second front against Germany to weaken the German forces attacking the Soviet Union, and to demonstrate Britain's sincerity in assisting the Soviet Union. This request was apparently delivered by Stalin to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, as they met on Tuesday. It is also understood that the content of this request is very clear. It is reported that the Soviet Union hopes to receive not only economic and expert assistance, but also supplies of armaments and ammunition. However, Moscow hopes to establish a new battlefield to show Britain's determination and sincerity in aiding the Soviet Union, and is unwilling for Britain to rely solely on air force activities. According to reliable sources, the Soviets believe that Hitler has concentrated 80% of the German air force's strength to deal with the Soviet Union. Many of the German airmen captured by the Soviet army have been transferred from Africa, Sicily, Greece, Crete, France, Belgium, and other areas. Although the Soviet side acknowledges that many outlying strongholds have been captured by the German army, authoritative sources here confirm that the Nazis have not yet broken through the main points of the "Stalin Line," although the fighting is still taking place east of Minsk. Some believe that the Soviet troops remaining in the occupied areas are deliberately doing so to disrupt the German rear, but this is not the case. These Soviet troops are unable to break through because they are forced, but they are unwilling to surrender, so they continue to fight, thereby disrupting the German rear from time to time. Reliable sources say that the main force of the German motorized units has so far been unable to break through the Ukrainian defense line. Whenever the Soviet army is surrounded by the German army, it can still maintain contact with the main Soviet force with the help of aircraft radio and tanks. This is because there is no fixed front, so that Soviet tanks can sneak through the German lines at any time to contact the surrounded Soviet troops. Reliable sources also said that the surrounded Soviet troops often break out after fierce fighting with the German army and join the main Red Army, regardless of the loss of a large number of personnel and supplies. It is also understood that the main tactics of the Soviet air force, although directly assisting the army, are strong enough to independently carry out long-range bombing, such as bombing Konigsberg, Danzig, Warsaw, Krakow, Rogin, Ploiesti, and Constanta. Experts here with inside information declare that the reason why the German army could not break through the Minsk position, causing a large number of Nazi mechanized units to be wiped out there, is primarily due to the Red Air Force. The Soviet side also said that the German air force is unwilling to engage the Soviet air force unless absolutely necessary. The Soviet side also said that Soviet naval aircraft have repeatedly engaged German naval aircraft in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, gaining the upper hand. The Soviets admit to losing countless aircraft, and also say that although they can fight independently, if Britain and the United States can help with armaments, aircraft, ammunition, and engines, the war is expected to end sooner. According to the most reliable sources, Romanian troops are being monitored by German troops, with 60 to 100 German soldiers in each Romanian unit. German troops are equipped with machine guns in the rear to supervise the troops, forbidding the Romanian troops to retreat. Someone asked a Soviet commentator whether the Romanian troops were really fighting. The Soviet commentator replied, "They are most outstanding at surrendering."</p>
<h3>Important Talks Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union; Soviet Ambassador Calls on Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 11th. The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, yesterday paid a courtesy visit to President Roosevelt, the first conversation in two years. After leaving the White House, he told reporters that he had informed the U.S. President of the good news of the Soviet-German war, and that all kinds of problems arising from this war, such as U.S. aid to the Soviet Union, had been discussed. He did not submit a list of Soviet needs to the President, because the U.S. government already knows very well what the Soviet Union wants to purchase in the U.S. When asked by reporters whether the Soviet-German war would last for a long time, Umansky only replied that it was a tough war. The Soviet Union is very grateful for the attitude adopted by President Roosevelt and the U.S. government towards the war against Germany, and especially admires the friendly and far-sighted attitude of the U.S. President in handling this issue. It is understood that the Soviet Ambassador's visit to the White House was at his own request. When the U.S. President received him, Assistant Secretary of State Welles was also present.</p>
<h3>Vichy Considers Reply to British Armistice Terms; Fighting in Syria Continues; Allied Forces Approach Beirut</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 11th. After General Dentz, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Syria, requested an armistice from the British forces, the British reply was forwarded here last night through the U.S. Embassy. The French government will immediately present its answer, but will never negotiate with the de Gaulle faction.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. According to information obtained here, the Vichy government received the British terms for an armistice in Syria in the early hours of today and is currently considering them. A reply is expected soon. Marshal Petain, General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of Vichy forces in North Africa, and Defense Minister Huntziger conferred on the matter this morning. The cabinet also convened a meeting this afternoon. The delay in General Dentz, Vichy's Special Commissioner in Syria, replying to the armistice terms, which led to many conflicting reports in the past 24 hours, was due to the interruption of telegraphic communication within Syria. The British authorities had no choice but to telegraph the armistice terms directly to Vichy on July 9. Meanwhile, the fighting in Syria is still continuing, especially on the coastal road north of Damascus to Beirut, where fierce fighting is underway. There is no information here about the news broadcast last night by the German-controlled Paris radio station that Australian troops had entered Beirut yesterday morning. According to reports from Reuters correspondents with the army, Australian infantry patrols have advanced to the hinterland of Kelte. Australian patrols are now engaged in mopping-up operations in the mountains. The main Vichy force seems to have retreated northwards. Fighting continued north of Damascus today, and there is no sign that General Dentz is preparing to surrender. It is reported that Australian troops are now advancing on Beirut, and their patrols have reached Abe, 10 kilometers southwest of the city.</p>

<h3>First Blackout Implemented in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 11th. Last night, the first blackout was implemented here from 11:00 to 11:30 PM. At that time, U.S. Army bombers monitored from the air. It is reported that the test results were very good, with few violations and no accidents. The public was quiet and interested.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Britain Arrives in Honolulu</h3>
<p>Reuters, Honolulu, 11th. Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, arrived here yesterday on his way back to Tokyo. Shigemitsu said that he was returning to Tokyo to report, and denied that he would succeed Matsuoka as Foreign Minister. He also said that he believed he would return to London at the end of the summer. He also said that he did not want to discuss Anglo-Japanese relations in detail, but said that relations between the two countries "could be improved." Shigemitsu also said that the Japanese Embassy in London had been destroyed by bombs, but said that there were very few Japanese casualties in London.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Uses Giant Tanks Weighing 120 Tons; Sharp Weapons for Charging and Breaking Through</h3>
<p>Havas, Rome, 10th. The Evening Post recently reported that the German army had captured a giant Soviet tank, weighing 120 tons, which is probably the largest tank in the world, equipped with three large cannons and four machine guns, and driven by twelve soldiers.</p>
<h3>Finnish Commander-in-Chief Announces to the Troops; Prepare for Any Sacrifice, Vow to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 11th. General Mannerheim yesterday issued a letter to all Finnish army soldiers stating, "In 1918, I told the Finns and Karelians that I must sheath my saber after I have obtained the liberation of Karelia. I swore an oath to the Finnish peasant army, believing that these brave men and women must prepare for any sacrifice. The new work has now begun. Karelia has formed an army and is advancing in step with the Finnish army. The hope of liberating Karelia and Greater Finland is now visible. All soldiers, the land on which you stand is stained with Finnish blood. Your victory will liberate Karelia and guarantee the future of Finland."</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 11th. According to political observers here, Finland may sever diplomatic relations with Britain. In addition, the military order issued by General Mannerheim is not only intended to recover the eastern part of Karelia, which was ceded to the Soviet Union last March, but also to recover the land ceded to the Soviet Union under the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.</p>

<h3>Encountering Strong Resistance from the Red Army, German Blitzkrieg Shows Failure; Front Line Warfare Became Quiet Yesterday; German Troops Busy Consolidating Acquired Positions</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. According to recent news from the Eastern Front, the German offensive has been temporarily stalled. London sources believe that the German armored units have been in continuous fierce fighting for more than two weeks and must urgently need rest. It is reported that the Soviet army is holding its ground in the Ostrov area and is making a strong counterattack in the central area. The German army is now trying to build strong positions north of the Tverna River near the Pripet Marshes to protect its flanks. Since the bloody battles in the Bialystok and Minsk areas, the land warfare yesterday seemed quite quiet. The Soviet military bulletin only announced the victory of the air force, saying that there was no major battle last night, and a total of 58 German aircraft were destroyed. According to a bulletin issued by the Soviet Information Bureau, there were no large-scale battles on the entire line last night. The Soviet air force continued to bomb enemy motorized and mechanized units and raided airfields. On July 10, a total of 58 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 9 Soviet aircraft were missing. Responsible sources in Moscow all believe that the cessation of activity on all fronts is the most significant development since the start of the war, and the blitzkrieg tactics have obviously failed due to encountering strong resistance. The Soviet Union is now doing its best to mobilize its manpower and technicians to prepare for continued war. The Soviet Union's attitude can be seen in the most popular war slogan, which is "Defeat the enemy on their own territory."</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 11th. The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following war report: All day on the 9th and on the morning of the 10th, the main battles in the Pruzhany and Novograd-Volynsky areas continued. (1) In the Ostrov area, our army repelled all enemy offensives, and the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. (2) In the Pruzhany area, fierce fighting is also underway, and our army is carrying out a resolute counterattack. (3) As a result of the fierce fighting in the Lepel area, one enemy motorized division was completely annihilated, 40 artillery pieces and other special machinery were also destroyed. (4) In the Borisov area, one enemy division suffered heavy losses. (5) In the Bobruisk and Novograd-Volynsky areas, our army repelled the enemy offensive and strictly guarded the lines. (6) In the Bessarabia area, the enemy offensive was curbed by our strong resistance. (7) There was no fierce fighting in other areas. (8) On the 9th, our air force destroyed 100 enemy tanks.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th. Last night's official report said that the entire line from Ostrov to Bobruisk was securely defended by the Soviet army. The German offensive still seemed to be concentrated on three main lines, namely Ostrov, Borisov, and Novograd-Volynsky. Experienced external military experts do not believe in the German claims of heavy Soviet air force losses, and say that the Soviet air force is very active and effective in assisting the Red Army. This communique is unable to confirm the German claims that Ostrov has been captured. According to news from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, the Soviet army still seems to control the city.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. A statement issued in Moscow last night stated that the Red Army has now established a fairly stable line on the entire front, and the recent Soviet information also has a confident tone. Therefore, commentators here with inside information are all in a quiet state of optimism. Although military observers are unwilling to be overly optimistic, they believe that if the Soviet army can continue to stop the German offensive for about two weeks and sometimes make small-scale counterattacks, their resistance can be extended for a considerable period of time. This may bring the German army to a standstill and give the Soviet army a chance to make a major counterattack later. Commentators cite three possible reasons for the German army's halt in advance, namely (1) the German army is exhausted after fighting the stubborn Soviet resistance for nearly three weeks, (2) deliberately stopping the advance to consolidate the positions it has acquired, and (3) the increase in Soviet resistance. British military experts mostly advocate the third reason, pointing out that the strategy of the Soviet high command is a policy of patience, allowing the enemy to advance to within the striking distance of its target, and then making the greatest resistance. At this critical juncture, the Soviet army will make a large-scale counterattack, but the Soviet army does not seem to intend to turn retreat into attack in the early stages of the war. If the Soviet army can limit the German army to the existing combat zone, it has already achieved its current goal, because it is believed that the German army must attack, otherwise it will admit defeat. It is believed that the German army is making the most of the relative calm to reorganize its rear lines of communication, which have obviously been destroyed by Soviet guerrillas and paratroopers.</p>
<p>End of the Minsk Encirclement Battle, Germany Claims Major Victory</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Führer Headquarters, 11th. The German High Command officially stated yesterday that the end of the Minsk and Bialystok double-pronged war has become the largest material encirclement battle in history. 323,898 Soviet soldiers were captured, including many commanders and division commanders. 3,332 tanks and armored vehicles, 1,809 artillery pieces, and countless other military supplies were destroyed or captured by our army. The total number of prisoners on the Eastern Front has increased to 400,000. The number of enemy tanks and armored vehicles captured or destroyed has reached 7,615, and the number of artillery pieces has reached 4,423. The loss of Soviet aircraft has reached 6,233.</p>
<p>Soviet Reserve Troops Complete Mobilization, Main Defense Line Unbreakable</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 11th. French military analysts concluded yesterday that the Soviet Union has completed the emergency call-up of two major reserve armies, north and south of the "Stalin Line," and that the mobilization of millions of Soviet reserve troops is still proceeding as usual. According to information obtained by the French, the German army has launched a two-pronged attack on the "Stalin Line." The first front is in Novograd-Volynsky, where the German army's direct offensive to break through the defense line failed. The second front is in Pruzhany, north of Minsk, where the German army is trying to build six bridgeheads across the Duna River by force. In the Bessarabia area, the German army and Romanian troops have begun to try to build bridgeheads across the Dniester River in the Balta area. Analysts say that the "Stalin Line" is about 10 to 30 miles deep. As far as is known here, the German army has only broken through a certain stronghold near Bobruisk.</p>
<p>Soviet Guerrillas Active Everywhere, Thoroughly Implementing Scorched Earth Policy</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. A correspondent for the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten reported from German territory in Ukraine that the Soviets in Ukraine are implementing Stalin's scorched earth policy, destroying everything as much as possible. The Soviets especially focus on destroying gas, water, electricity, and transportation. Grains have not been completely destroyed, because some have not yet matured. All the signs in Ukraine show that there have been fierce battles. The German troops have confirmed the stories of the Soviet soldiers' bravery. The German army is quite surprised by the excellent quality of the Soviet armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. Moscow Radio said that the Soviet army is implementing Stalin's scorched earth policy extremely thoroughly, so that farmers poison livestock before leaving the occupied areas. The radio station also described the activities of Soviet guerrillas behind the enemy lines on the front lines, saying that their activities are not only well-known, but also caused a Berlin correspondent for the Swedish newspaper to send out disturbing telegrams.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 11th. The newspaper "Izvestia" published an editorial today advocating that the Soviet Union should adopt guerrilla tactics behind the German lines. It said, in part, that any citizen living in an invaded war zone should regard himself as a member of the Red Army. The predecessors of our revolutionary army should be the guides of their guerrilla units. When the enemy approaches, they should move livestock, destroy all food, and systematically destroy all kinds of roads.</p>
<h3>Soviet Tank Fights Ten Enemies, Minsk Soviet Commander is a Mechanical Warfare Expert</h3>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 11th. Commander Nadin's tank stopped by the forest and found a group of enemy tanks in the road. Nadin waited until they were a little closer and shot the first enemy tank. The enemy tank's engine stopped, blocking the road. The German tank crew tried to retreat, but Nadin shot the tank in the back. Ten of the enemy's twelve tanks were surrounded by flames. Nadin and the gunner Kopytov took the opportunity to bombard the enemy. Thus, the Soviet tank defeated twelve enemies with one.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. General P. G. Grigorenko, the current commander of the Soviet forces in Minsk, is one of the Soviet Union's leading experts in mechanized warfare. During the Spanish Civil War, he organized and trained armored units for the Republican army. Mr. Grigorenko invented the practice of placing a number of elite soldiers on top of heavy tanks and driving them into the battlefield. These soldiers carry machine guns and hand grenades, which can greatly enhance the attacking power of tanks.</p>
<h3>German Army Major General Killed in Action in Finland</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 11th. German newspapers published yesterday that Army Division Commander Major General Ottu recently died in action in Finland because he took the lead.</p>
<h3>Toyo Keizai Comments on the German-Soviet War Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th. The "Japan Times" commented on the German-Soviet war today, saying that Germany took the initiative at the beginning of the war, using powerful methods at points between Finland and Bessarabia to establish an advantage and temporarily confuse the enemy as to the direction of the main German attack. But at this time, the Soviet command must have had the opportunity to estimate where the greatest attack force was used, and signs of Soviet resistance are now gradually appearing on the lines between the Prut River and Smolensk and Kiev. If the German side does obtain Ukraine militarily, then political movements must proceed simultaneously, with large-scale organization to make the Ukrainian peasants support national socialism. Now the whole situation is extremely complex, and politics and military affairs must complement each other, so that after the occupied land, the farmland and factories can continue their production necessary for long-term peace.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on the European War (68): An Impression of Paderewski</h3>
<p>Ignace Jan Paderewski, the great Polish man and world-renowned piano virtuoso, recently passed away in New York. The following is a translation of an impression of him by a reporter from the New York Times:</p>
<p>Poland has always had many heroic figures, and Paderewski was no exception. He was an artist and a politician, rich in humanitarianism and patriotic fervor.</p>
<p>Not many days ago, he was sitting in a small parlor of a modest hotel in New York. His health was not very good, but he worked tirelessly. It is now clear that rumors of his abandoning political life due to his declining physical strength were completely unfounded. Since arriving in New York on November 6th of last year (his eightieth birthday), he had issued several appeals to Polish Americans and carried out relief work for Polish refugees. Despite the advice of close friends, he continued to work tirelessly, meticulously working within the strictly limited hours he allowed himself, unwilling to waste a single moment of energy or time. He worked an average of two hours a day, and sometimes more.</p>
<p>I passed through a room filled with odds and ends, but strangely, there was no piano in the room, which was disappointing. In another room, I saw Paderewski sitting upright at the table. His attire was familiar to all who had visited him or appreciated his music—a long formal coat, a soft collar, and a neatly tied bow tie. He sat there, withered and still, like an old monk in meditation, barely moving. He did not make a pointless expression, nor did he say a superfluous word. He answered all inquiries directly to the point, sometimes concisely and subtly.</p>
<p>His hair was paler and thinner than when I had seen him four years ago, but that was inconsequential. Since then, he had given one last performance to the New York audience, and two years ago, the New York Radio City Music Hall had broadcast his piano solo program to millions of listeners around the world. It would not be surprising if he were to regain his vigor and revive his old tunes at this moment. Moreover, people could listen to his speeches before enjoying his art.</p>
<p>I still remember in 1916, when the First European War was in full swing. Paderewski traveled through the various states of the United States, playing the piano and pleading for the independence and freedom of Poland. Before opening the piano and playing the magnificent scores of the great Polish composer Chopin, he delivered moving speeches with the eloquence of a politician and the majesty of a monarch of the stage. This speech, which he and his advisors and secretaries had spent a night writing, has now become a historical document. There has never been such a solemn and dramatic figure as him. His voice (previously unheard by the audience) and his gentle and firm attitude complemented each other, as if flowing out of his music.</p>
<p>Paderewski is still the same person as he was then, only a little older and weaker, but this does not detract from the greatness of his art and character. His greatness and humility were revealed in his conversation at all times.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Which is more beneficial to mankind, a great artist or a great politician?"</p>
<p>He could have seized the opportunity to denigrate politicians and elevate the transcendence of artists to the highest heavens. However, he was unwilling to do so. Whether a politician or an artist, a great man like him who is beneficial to the country is always indispensable.</p>
<p>On another occasion, I asked him if his many years of political work and musical life, which had made him famous, had fulfilled his long-cherished wish. His answer made a deep impression on me. He said, "I can only tell you: I have fought several major battles."</p>
<p>He continues to fight, and now he is someone who sits and watches the success or failure. His physical strength has declined and is not as strong as it was in his youth. In those years when he was the Prime Minister, one night an assassin broke into his house, holding a pistol in one hand and a letter of resignation in the other, forcing him to sign. He initially pretended to obey and pounced on the assassin suddenly, knocking the enemy's pistol to the ground. His wife, alarmed by the noise, came in to see what was happening, only to see her husband slamming the head of a stranger against the wall.</p>
<p>The generous and courteous Paderewski of his youth has now become a contemplative elder. He is always courteous and considerate of other people's feelings. He is not only reluctant to express himself, but he does not waste words. Sometimes, to save energy, he only speaks of a central topic, allowing his secretary, Mr. Sztralaga, to elaborate on his meaning in detail.</p>
<p>"You can imagine that I must advocate for Poland," he said to me calmly, "but the needs of Poland cannot be separated from the needs of the entire world, which is universally known. Totalitarianism must be overthrown, and free and autonomous governments must be restored. Unless this is realized, everything is empty talk!"</p>

Chinese guerrilla units appear and disappear unpredictably, attacking Japanese troops and destroying transportation. They planted landmines on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, overturning many Japanese vehicles, and also destroyed highways and blew up bridges, achieving great battle results. The Japanese army felt deeply threatened and recently concentrated its forces to "mop up" the Chinese army, but due to the Chinese army's elusive actions, there were no results.

<h3>The Military Commission Released the Week's War Situation: July 4 to 10</h3>
<p>Chongqing The situation of the war for a week (from July 4th to 10th) was discussed by the spokesperson of the Military Commission. This week coincides with the fourth anniversary of the sacred Anti-Japanese War. First of all, we should express our infinite condolences to the national heroic spirits and our infinite respect to the brave soldiers. The Japanese are now encountering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the so-called "southward advance" and "northward advance," but they are unable to move and hesitate to reach out, which is all due to the merits of the Chinese national protection heroic spirits and brave soldiers. During this week, the Japanese have tried to make various gestures, as if they were about to do something, but their feelings were all fierce and weak. Therefore, there were only small battles in various coastal areas this week, as described below.</p>
<p>Zhao'an</p>
<p>It is a small bay in the area where Min and Yue are connected. In mid-February of last year, Japan once landed and invaded, but was immediately defeated by China, and 3,000 mercenaries defected, giving Japan a major blow. This time, on the morning of the 4th, Japan gathered more than a thousand people and took several Japanese warships to forcibly land in places such as Gongkou Xun Dachen Zhailin, intending to invade Zhao'an. The Chinese army immediately resisted them in the Zhuxi Ridge, Liuli Ridge, and Fenshuiguan areas south and west of Zhao'an. By the afternoon of the 6th, the Japanese were completely repelled, killing and wounding more than 400 of them. The Japanese then retreated, occupying Huanggang City and joining the Japanese who landed from Jingzhou Slope and occupied the city, closing the city and holding on, and burning all the houses in the northeast suburbs of the city to prevent Chinese troops from pursuing the stronghold. But it was still pressed by China, and a part of the Japanese reinforcements arrived, and then turned west and invaded Qiandong Xianzhou Zhanglin and other places. The Chinese army intercepted them along the Dabeishan Lianhua. By the morning of the 8th, the Chinese and Japanese were still in a bloody battle in the area north of Zhanglin.</p>
<p>Fuzhou</p>
<p>The guerrilla teams in the four suburbs were dispatched one after another, attacking the outer strongholds of Dabeishan and other places. On the evening of the 3rd, they broke into the North Gate, killing more than 100 Japanese troops and returning. It has now been confirmed that the Japanese Yoshida Regiment Commander who was killed by China in the Battle of Dahu has been cremated in Fuzhou and a memorial service was held. The Japanese troops in Nanfuqing fell into Honglu one day, but were recaptured by the Chinese army that night, and more than 200 were killed and wounded.</p>
<p>Yuhuan</p>
<p>The Japanese army landed in Kanmen Town in the southeast at 4 a.m. one day, and the Chinese army fought bravely, killing many Japanese. By the 3rd, the Japanese were unable to hold on and escaped on warships. There are no Japanese traces on the island now.</p>
<p>In addition</p>
<p>The Chinese guerrillas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line are unusually active and have made great achievements. On the morning of the 7th, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was destroyed in many places by China, and the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters in Nanshi, Shanghai, was also bombed by China. Japan was greatly panicked. A part of the Japanese army in Guichi, southern Anhui, invaded the southeast of the city at dawn on the 7th. Two thousand Japanese troops in Jingmen, western Hubei, also invaded the northwest of the city on the morning of the 7th and were repelled by the Chinese army. (Eleventh Telegraph)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Fiercely Attacked Italy's Southern Seaport; British Aircraft Flew into German Territory for Large-Scale Bombing; 130 Times in the 18th</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 11th The latest Italian communiqué announced that Naples, an important port and naval base in southern Germany, was attacked by British and Japanese air forces for nine consecutive nights. It was bombed by British aircraft again last night for a total of three hours. The damage to houses was heavy, with 35 dead and 33 injured.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 11th The British Air Force communiqué in the Middle East stated that on Wednesday, British aircraft attacked Italian seaplanes in Syracuse, Sicily. Three Italian aircraft were swept and burned, and many were heavily damaged. There were also many Italian aircraft crew casualties. British aircraft also fought with Italian aircraft in the airspace off the coast of Sicily, heavily damaging many Italian aircraft.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 11th In the 18 days since Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, the British Air Force has completed 136 consecutive attacks on the western front of Germany. The places bombed by British aircraft include the German-occupied areas of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway. Le Havre and Cherbourg are also among the places bombed. British aircraft have been bombing the above places almost day and night in order to reduce the pressure of German aircraft on the Soviet Union. British observers believe that this attack has been effective, as it has forced the German aircraft fleet to disperse its forces to pay attention to France. It is generally believed that the losses of British daytime air strikes in France are evidence that some of the best German airmen are still in France. However, the communiqué last night was very noteworthy. The communiqué stated that there had been fierce encounters in the airspace over France. In the air battle, Germany lost 13 aircraft, while Britain lost 11. The total losses of both sides in the 18th were 213 German aircraft and 192 British aircraft.</p>

<h3>Historical Materials on the Establishment of a Consulate in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— By Yi</p>
<p>(Our Hong Kong Correspondent) Negotiations between China and Britain for the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong have a history of fifty years. During the late Qing Guangxu reign, there were two rounds of talks, but for various reasons, no conclusion was ever reached. It was not until the new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi returned to China this time that a principled agreement was reached on this negotiation. After the long-pending Sino-Burmese border demarcation was concluded, the Hong Kong consulate establishment issue was resolved in conjunction, marking a new page in Sino-British diplomatic history. A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing recently stated that the first Consul-General to Hong Kong will be appointed as Mr. Diao Zuqian. The historical materials on the Hong Kong consulate establishment negotiations and a brief biography of Mr. Diao are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiated for Fifty Years</p>
<p>The negotiations for the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong have failed to produce results for fifty years. In the past four years, the population of Hong Kong has continued to surge, increasing from over 700,000 to over one million. Over 90% of this total is Chinese, and its position in the Far East is second only to Singapore. However, for China, it is even more important than Singapore; economically, it has become an important base for China, and the center of international transportation routes, further increasing its prosperity. Therefore, the recent negotiations for the establishment of a Chinese consulate have a good chance of success, which is the main factor. Since the beginning of this year, representatives from China and Britain have been actively negotiating, and the matter has been properly discussed with the British authorities by the new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi before leaving Britain, so it is likely to become a reality this time.</p>
<p>Zeng Jize's Efforts</p>
<p>The first representative I sent for negotiations was Mr. Zeng Jize (Duke Zeng Huimin). After several rounds of negotiations, Mr. Zeng ultimately achieved no results, because Britain was unwilling to establish a Chinese consulate, but had no reason to refuse, so it could only delay with empty words, and the result was naturally no progress, and it was aborted. Xue Fucheng's diary during his mission to England, France, Italy, and Belgium, contains the following passage:</p>
<p>"Duke Zeng Huimin intended to establish a consulate in Hong Kong, and sent letters several times. The British Foreign Office used the excuse of consulting the colonial department, and the colonial department used the argument that it was inconvenient for officials and civilians, but no agreement was reached after much pleading."</p>
<p>Xue Fucheng's Arguments</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Xue Fucheng also exerted efforts to negotiate, because Mr. Xue was then an imperial envoy to England, France, Italy, and Belgium, and was an appropriate person to participate in the matter. What initially drew his attention to the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong was the memorandum from the Zongli Yamen (the highest foreign affairs agency in the Qing Dynasty) on May 14th, Guangxu 16th year (1890), asking him to discuss with the British Foreign Office the establishment of Chinese consulates on British-owned islands near Singapore. Therefore, he thought of the importance of establishing a consulate in Hong Kong, and decided on a negotiation method. He believed that "establishing one place and negotiating one place, piece by piece, would only waste words, and it would be difficult to be sure of success." But what method could achieve this goal? Thus, "English Secretary Magery (Qing Chen) suggested first issuing a diplomatic note to the Foreign Office, citing public law and the usual practice of various countries, stating that China could send consuls to reside in British territories, without specifying where for the time being, and that Japan and Siam already had consuls in Hong Kong, but they alone firmly rejected China, which was unfair. Now, if we only discuss the general principles of common practice, they will have no excuse to reject us. Once they agree, then we can appoint consuls wherever we want." Mr. Xue thought it was appropriate, so he asked Secretary Ma to draft an English note, and sent it to the British Foreign Office on August 13th, Guangxu 16th year. The reasons stated inside were:</p>
<p>(1) "Although China has not yet allowed Westerners to trade in all parts of the interior, even from what China has done, it is enough for China to ask for permission to establish consuls in British territories, so China hopes that Britain will allow it to send consuls to reside in British territories, and handle matters in the same way as it allows consuls of other friendly countries to reside."</p>
<p>(2) "China has over twenty places where foreign people are allowed to reside and trade, and the taxes levied are lighter than those in other countries with treaties. Britain has sent consuls to reside in these twenty-one places."</p>
<p>(3) "In 1878, when your lordship drafted the note, the Yantai Treaty had not yet been ratified, but it already stated that China had the right to send consuls to British territories; also, in the treaty of October 24th, 1860, it was clearly stated that Britain was willing to recognize China's right to send consuls to various parts of Britain; although this treaty has not been followed... the British government had already intended to allow the establishment of Chinese consulates."</p>
<p>On the 16th, Mr. Xue sent Secretary Ma Qingchen to the British Foreign Office to inquire about the establishment of consulates on the various islands in the South Seas. According to Qingchen's conversation with Vice-Secretary Sandersen, it can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Sandersen's opinion: (1) "The Sino-British treaty has no explicit provision for China to establish consulates in British territory, so there have been many obstacles in the past when discussing this matter"; (2) "Hong Kong is close to Guangdong, and is entirely inhabited by Chinese, so if Chinese officials are established there, it is inevitable that they will overshadow the British"; (3) "China's customs are just beginning to open up, and it is feared that the consuls will not know their duties, and will engage in infringing on rights and overstepping boundaries."</p>
<p>Qingchen's opinion: (1) "The treaty has an explicit provision for Britain to establish consulates in China, and this should be applied equally. If everything had to be written in detail, the treaty would be too cumbersome"; (2) "Japan and Siam already have consuls in Hong Kong, but China alone is not allowed, which is difficult to explain. What cannot be explained in terms of reason cannot be done in terms of power"; (3) "Consul Zuo Binglong in Singapore... is familiar with Chinese and foreign affairs, and handles matters appropriately, without any complaints from near or far. If a Chinese consulate is established in Hong Kong, it is said that Zuo Binglong will be transferred there to start everything, and it will definitely be done according to law."</p>
<p>The focus of this negotiation was twofold: one was the establishment of consulates on various islands near Singapore, and the establishment of a Consul-General in Singapore to oversee them, which was the intention of the Zongli Yamen; the other was the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong, which was Mr. Xue's intention, and was the focus of this negotiation.</p>
<p>Later, on October 19th, the British Foreign Office's note was received, the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"To the matter of issuing a note, this Lordship's department has received Your Excellency's letter of September 23rd, stating:</p>
<p>The Chinese court wishes to send consuls to reside in British territory, etc. This matter has been carefully considered by the British government, and now this Lordship's department is very pleased to inform Your Excellency that the British government is willing to give credentials to the consuls sent by China, and handle matters in the same way as it gives to the consuls of other foreign friendly countries, but there are places where the circumstances of the place need to be considered, and there may be places where credentials cannot be given for the time being. This needs to be decided by the British government after examining the circumstances. Correspondingly issuing this note to Your Excellency, please bother to check it, it must be to the note, November 29th, 1890, issued from the Foreign Office."</p>
<p>The place referred to here as a place where "the circumstances of the place need to be considered" refers to New Gold Mountain, not Hong Kong. Therefore, on the 20th, Mr. Xue "replied to the Foreign Office, praising its fairness in handling matters, and informing it that the Chinese consuls to be sent should first be in Hong Kong and near Singapore, and that two officials have now been selected, pending approval by the Zongli Yamen. These two officials are experienced, knowledgeable, discreet, and peaceful, and are certainly competent. The one to be stationed in Hong Kong is planned to be Zuo Binglong, the Consul in Singapore, and the one to be stationed in Singapore is planned to be Huang Zunxian, the Second Secretary of the Embassy, not only as Consul in Singapore, but also as Consul in Penang, Malacca, and nearby places. As for the Deputy Consuls to be selected for Penang and other places, they will be reported after they have been reviewed and approved."</p>
<p>A few days later, the British "Foreign Office issued a note, saying that it had been received and that there were no objections." Mr. Xue believed that "the overall situation has been settled."</p>
<p>In summary, the fundamental reason why Mr. Xue sought the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong at that time was that "Hong Kong is a vital hub for Sino-foreign communication. All Chinese and foreign goods first arrive in Hong Kong, and then are transshipped to various provinces. The most important issues for negotiation are (1) escaped criminals, (2) smuggling, and (3) maritime boundaries. Whenever there is a major case in Guangdong Province, officials are sent to Hong Kong, but because there is no consulate, their voices are cut off, and there are many obstacles. The addition of a consulate here cannot be delayed."</p>
<p>As for the establishment of a Hong Kong consulate, which was "settled overall," history tells us that it became a bubble.</p>
<p>In recent years, a new China has been established. Thanks to the continuous assistance from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, diplomatic relations have become unprecedentedly cordial. At this time, Hong Kong has become a center of China's international transportation routes, and the population has increased to over one million, of which over 90% are Chinese. The establishment of a Chinese consulate in Hong Kong is urgently needed, and Britain also feels that China no longer needs to be suspected too much. Sino-British relations have become closer day by day, so after much negotiation, especially before the new Minister Guo Taiqi left Britain, he discussed the matter with the British authorities, and there has been progress. Moreover, the consular organization has been planned as one Consul-General, one Vice-Consul, and four Consuls.</p>
<p>Candidate for the First Consul in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Diao Zuqian, courtesy name Cheng Zhang, is from Xingning, Guangdong. At the age of ten, he followed his father to Honolulu. He later went to Shanghai to study and graduated from St. John's University. He then went to England and entered Cambridge University, where he obtained a Master of Arts and a Doctor of Laws degree. He once served as the Supervisor of Chinese Students in England. In the second year of Xuantong, he returned to China and took the examination for students studying abroad, and was awarded the title of Jinshi and appointed to the Hanlin Academy. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as the chief writer of the English Beijing Daily. He successively served as Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then transferred to serve as Counselor of the Embassy in England, President of Tsinghua University, Minister to Cuba, Minister to Panama, and Consul-General in Singapore. Diao is good at sports, especially tennis. A dispatch from Chongqing also mentioned that he would be appointed as Minister to Australia. Recently, it has been reported that he will be appointed as the first Consul-General in Hong Kong. This is recorded here for verification.</p>

<p>This newspaper recently received a letter from the owner of Mianxingxuan, saying that he reads your newspaper's commercial news every day, and is satisfied with all economic data, but recently the foreign currency market quotations published in your newspaper are extremely inaccurate for the buying and selling quotations of British and American gold pounds. At first, I thought it was a temporary error, and it would be corrected the next day, but it is like this today, and it is like this again tomorrow, which is deeply regrettable. Check the market quotations of the 7th, the British pound buying price is 185 yuan, the buying price is 180 yuan, the US gold pound selling price is 188 yuan, the buying price is 183 yuan, the difference between the buying and selling price is nine yuan, check that most of the collectors of this gold pound are women, they only know to buy based on the newspaper's report, if someone goes to a small money shop to buy, they will definitely say that there is no stock, but if they sell it, they will close the deal according to the market price in your newspaper, such a trace becomes fraud, please your newspaper investigate it for luck,</p>
<p>After receiving this letter, this newspaper immediately sent it to the foreign currency market quotation interviewer for reply, and now the reply letter is transcribed to answer the owner of Mianxingxuan and to inform the readers, roughly saying that regarding the exchange rate issue of British and American gold pounds, the following is explained, the British pound has always been based on the weight of 23387, to the closing price of the shabu red on that day (such as today's closing price is 6623.00) plus the cash premium of 290.00, two total 6913, to 6913.00x23387, the number obtained is 162 yuan, but because the amount of cash pounds in circulation is very small, so the market often raises, roughly raising the above price by four or five yuan, that is, each pound is 166 or 7 yuan, this is the actual formal market quotation, recently because small peers hoard goods for speculation, often do as high as 170 odd yuan, (but there is absolutely no market quotation outside of 180 yuan), the above wild market, I am unwilling to report and publish it, but since there are readers who come to question, I have to publish it according to the wild market,</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Fine Cloth Plunges, Futures Down About Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was affected by the sharp drop in Eastern piece goods, with fine cloth twills bearing the brunt of the impact. Sales suffered a significant setback, with fine cloth and fine twills falling by five to seven and a half jiao per piece. Some coarse cloth and coarse twills fell by two and a half jiao, while the remaining stocks remained stable. Bleached cloth and colored cloth also decreased by about five jiao. Over three hundred pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Buyers were in a wait-and-see mood. Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian buyers purchased over two hundred pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Shandong buyers purchased fifty to sixty pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Today, two hundred pieces of cotton cloth are being shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: As yarn prices continue to fall, short sellers in the exchange seized the opportunity to aggressively sell, causing a fierce downward trend. Prices plummeted in a straight line during both morning and afternoon sessions. Fine cloth futures for distant months fell by as much as two yuan. The spot market also followed suit, but mid-range fine cloth and fine twills fared better due to acceptable sales on this street, falling by only seven and a half to one yuan per piece.

It is noted that major players in the industry are holding firm, so although prices have fallen, the market remains tight.</p>
<p>Grain: Rice Stocks Steadily Increasing, Rice Prices Further Reduced, But Still Hoping for War</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market formed a fluctuating pattern. The morning market was flat and lacked positive signs, but soon selling pressure surged, leading to a sharp decline. This was because publicly investigated warehouse stocks of rice had increased dramatically due to continuous arrivals. Yesterday, the published figure reached 2,173,468 bags. The quantity held by shops and food households was also substantial, and the volume of publicly sold rice awaiting sale was considerable. Pricing gradually decreased, and further reductions were possible. As a result, many scattered sellers emerged, and prices for all current-term rice fell across the board. Xiaowen for July, which opened at one hundred and fifty-three yuan yesterday, fell to one hundred and fifty yuan. Dafu Yuangen Xiaozhi fell to one hundred and fifty yuan and five jiao. Other grades, such as Siamese futures No. 2 and various grades of spot rice, fell by varying amounts ranging from one yuan to two and a half yuan. However, this decline triggered inquiries from scalpers, and buying groups took advantage of the lower prices to make purchases. Subsequently, rumors spread throughout the market, all favorable to long positions. Speculators suddenly became excited, and July Xiaojiao rose from one hundred and fifty-one yuan, one yuan and a half, two yuan, two yuan and three jiao, to one hundred and fifty-two yuan and a half. Market prices immediately increased by two yuan. Current Xiaowen Yinghua Company was priced at one hundred and fifty yuan and eight jiao. Erqu Siamese rose from one hundred and forty-two yuan, three yuan and a half, to one hundred and forty-four yuan, ultimately closing only a few jiao higher than the previous close. Spot rice also recovered from its lows, ultimately closing only a few jiao to one yuan higher. Total daily transactions included fifteen to sixteen hundred tons for Yinghua Company and sixteen to seventeen thousand bags of spot rice. The closing price for high-quality Saigon No. 1 was one hundred and thirty-one yuan and a half, one hundred and thirty-one yuan, Zhongguan one hundred and twenty yuan and two jiao, one hundred and twenty-eight yuan and three jiao, No. 2 one hundred and twenty-three yuan and five jiao, one hundred and twenty-three yuan, small bags one hundred and seventeen or eighteen yuan, Siamese No. 2 one hundred and twenty-one yuan and a half, Mindang one hundred and thirty-three yuan, Ruofo rice one hundred and twenty-seven or eight yuan, Annam glutinous rice one hundred and thirty-three yuan, Tokyo polished tip one hundred and fifteen yuan and eight jiao, broken tip ninety-eight yuan to ninety-six yuan, No. 2 broken ninety-one yuan.</p>
<p>The Arrival of Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Continues to be Strong, but Sales are Slow, Continuing to Present an Uneven Supply and Demand Situation. Market Conditions are Difficult to Maintain, and Prices for Both Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Have Fallen Again by One Yuan Per Stone. Early and Late Season Fresh Rice from Kainan Port is Priced at One Hundred and Forty-Two Yuan to One Hundred and Forty Yuan, Wuxi Original Bag White Japonica Rice at One Hundred and Thirty-Five Yuan, Old Rice at One Hundred and Thirty-Two or Three Yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Due to Continued Weakness in Foreign Rice, Sales of Both Domestic and Foreign Glutinous Rice are Stagnant. Although Lenders See Scarce Goods and Still Attempt to Persist, They Ultimately Find it Difficult to Succeed. As a Result, Prices are Weak Across the Board, with Prices Falling by About One Yuan. Hong Kong White Yuan is Priced at One Hundred and Twenty-Four Yuan, Ultimately Falling to One Hundred and Twenty-One Yuan, Jindan Domestic Yuan One Hundred and Twenty-Seven Yuan to One Hundred and Twenty-Five Yuan, Glutinous Lv is Not Seen to be Opening.</p>
<p>Today, 1,500 Bags of Corn will be Loaded onto the Taikoo Company's New Beijing Ship for Shipment to Yantai.</p>
<p>Flour Market Initially Weak, Then Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market was initially weak, then firm. The morning market opened weakly due to sluggish actual sales. Jinlong flour opened at only thirty-two yuan and six jiao, and Paotai flour at thirty-three yuan and six jiao. However, favorable news soon emerged, and rumors of a firmer rice market improved sentiment. Local buyers and speculators successively purchased. Jinlong flour rose from thirty-two yuan and six jiao to seven, eight, nine jiao, then twenty-three yuan and one jiao. Paotai flour also increased by two jiao to thirty-three yuan and eight jiao. As a result, it closed one or two jiao firmer than the previous day. Zhonglou brand also traded above thirty-four yuan, and Chiyan brand at thirty-three yuan, both reported stable. Fifteen to sixteen thousand bags were transacted. Market fundamentals remain hidden.</p>
<p>New Wheat Supply Remains Severed, and the Japanese Factory Retail Price is Still Limited to Forty Yuan, Which is Not in Line with Production Costs. Therefore, Operators are Mostly Watching. Foreign Wheat Flour Shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the Taikoo Company's Hanyang Ship Arrived the Day Before Yesterday, in Addition to Loading Foreign Rice for the Public Works Department, Also Shipped 5,600 Bags of Wheat Flour from Hong Kong, Which Has Been Unloaded.

<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Mung Beans are Stagnant, Prices Fall, Bean Cakes Fill Shorts, Reversing Market Trends</p>
<p>Tea Beans: This Year, Due to High Prices and Stagnant Sales, Local Demand is Significantly Lower Than in the Past, Which is Quite Unexpected by Stockholders. As a Result, Market Momentum is Soft and Difficult to Revive. Yesterday, from this Street, 250 Bags of Qingdao Mung Beans were Priced at Twelve Yuan and Eight Jiao, and 200 Bags of Tianjin Mung Beans were Priced at Forty-Eight Yuan, Both Lower Than Before.</p>
<p>Bean Cakes: The Morning Market Opened Fairly Stable Yesterday, but Due to Continued Selling by Many Accounts, it Briefly Weakened by One or Two Jiao. Ultimately, Buying to Cover Shorts Led to a Reversal, and Prices Rose by a Jiao or So Compared to Before. 500 Pieces of Kai Da You Bean Cakes Were Sold, and 2,500 Pieces of Sheng Ji Bean Cakes Spot, Approximately 20,000 Pieces in Futures (Price Details in Market Price Column).</p>

<h3>Coal: Xiaoziting Coal is Scarce</h3>
<p>--Price increased by ten yuan--</p>
<p>Hongji No. 1 Xiaoziting coal, in recent months, due to the suspension of sales by a certain foreign firm in the French Concession, only Tong Coal is available, making pure Xiaoziting coal a rare commodity in the market. A certain firm has increased the price by ten yuan on fellow traders, from four hundred and twenty yuan to four hundred and thirty yuan. However, lump coal prices remain unchanged in the open market, but are slightly firmer in the informal market, as foreign exchange rates have tightened recently, and stockholders are resuming absorption. Sales of firewood remain flat.</p>

<h3>Sassoon Discusses Far East Situation: US and Japan Unlikely to Go to War, Japan Taking Cautious Steps Towards the US, Hitler Actively Trying to Induce Japan to Fight</h3>
<p>Sir Victor Sassoon, a leading figure in the city's financial circles, returned here on the President Pierce steamer the day before yesterday (10th) after being away from Shanghai for several months. Yesterday (11th) morning, he told the press that the United States and Britain should concentrate their land and sea forces to fight Hitler's totalitarianism. He believed that the United States, while linked to South America, could not guarantee its security, as the North and South American continents have no common economic ground. If Britain were to lose, South America would be entirely within the Nazi sphere of influence. For the connection between North and South America to succeed, Britain must win.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Will Not Be Defeated by Germany: Currently, the power of isolationists in the United States has diminished compared to before. Isolationists certainly do not want war, but they are even more disgusted with Hitler. Very few want to see Hitler control the United States, and their opinions are insignificant. Sassoon continued, "I am currently not sympathetic to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a totalitarian state and has also broken promises and torn up treaties when it suited itself. However, I do not believe that the Soviet Union will be defeated by Germany, as the Soviet Union has a large area and can continue to resist, just like China."</p>
<p>Hitler Intends to Use Japan: Sassoon also said, "I do not believe that the United States and Japan are likely to go to war, as the Japanese government is taking cautious steps towards the United States and knows that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union and becomes Japan's neighbor, Japan may ally with the United States. Hitler urgently needs Japan's navy and is willing to give Japan any promises it requests, whether it be the Dutch East Indies, Australia, India, or Vietnam. Hitler is willing to allow Japan to set foot, just asking Japan to assist with the navy in return."</p>
<p>If Successful, He Will Invade Japan Again: But if Hitler succeeds in defeating the United States, he will turn to Japan. He believes that Japan is not being fooled by Hitler and that Japan is only making treaties with Germany because it suits itself at the moment. Last December, he knew that Soviet-German relations would break down, and the Japanese government had received intelligence that the Soviet-German split would occur in August or September. Unexpectedly, Hitler changed his plans again, and the split with the Soviet Union was even faster than everyone expected.</p>
<p>Four Days on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Damaged Tracks Have Been Repaired, Destroyed Vehicles Piled by the Roadside</p>
<p>Along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, Chinese guerrillas have been unusually active since the 7th of this month. The work of demolishing tracks and laying mines has been discovered everywhere, causing trains to be bombed in many places and frequently interrupted, causing great inconvenience to passengers. Until the day before yesterday (Thursday), the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway had two sections of track destroyed between Longtan and Gaozi. Between Danyang and Lingkou, near Lujiabang Tianfu Temple in Kunshan, two landmines exploded. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, a landmine exploded between Linban Xucun. At 9:30 AM on the 10th, the Tianma Express train from Nanjing to Shanghai was bombed again between Qixia Mountain and Longtan. There were six incidents in four days. All the damaged tracks have now been completely repaired, so traffic has resumed as usual yesterday. However, some of the destroyed vehicles are still piled by the roadside.</p>
<h3>President Pierce Steamer Bids Farewell to Shanghai: Sailed Directly Back to the US Last Night, Japan Cancels Port Calls Along the Way, Future US Ships to Shanghai Will Be Irregular</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' President Pierce steamer arrived in Shanghai around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (10th), berthed at floating docks 12 and 13. Originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday to return to the US, due to insufficient loading, it was changed to set sail at 10:00 PM last night, heading directly to Honolulu, then to San Francisco, for transfer by the US Maritime Commission.</p>
<p>There Were Over 300 Passengers: Does Not Call at Japanese Ports, This Ship is the Last Time to Come to Shanghai. In addition to those disembarking in this city, there are about 200 passengers on the original ship returning to the US via Shanghai.

Next month, one ship will come from the US to Shanghai, heading to Hong Kong and Luzon. One ship will return from Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai. The date must be in the latter half of next month. As for the ship's name and exact sailing schedule, they are kept secret and not announced.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Returns Home by Ship: The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in the United States will hold exercises in Jiaozhou Park at 8:00 AM this morning (11th) to bid farewell to the regiment's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne. Mr. Wayne has been ordered to return to service in the town of Parissieu, South Carolina, and will depart from the Customs Wharf at 5:15 PM today, boarding the President Pierce steamer to return to the US.</p>
<h3>German Women and Children in Dutch East Indies Take Refuge in German School, Cared for by the German Embassy and Consulate, The Remaining 400-Plus People Go to Japan on the Original Ship</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that 666 German women and children residing in the Dutch East Indies were released from detention camps and arrived here yesterday (10th) on the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru. 199 of them have disembarked in Shanghai and are now staying at the German school on Avenue Haig. 70 of them will travel from Shanghai to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Beiping, while the rest will stay in Shanghai and be cared for by the German embassy and consulate in this city. The remaining 467 people will continue on the Asama Maru to Nagasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama in Japan, where they will also be cared for by German expatriates. A reporter visited the Asama Maru and interviewed the German women. According to them, they were given bread and canned meat in the detention camps in the Dutch East Indies. Their husbands, sons, or brothers, being able-bodied men, were still detained in the Dutch East Indies detention camps and would not be released until the end of the war. Some German women complained about the poor food in the detention camps, but they were all quite happy and not haggard. It is said that this was due to the excellent food and drink on the ship for the past eleven days. They have no definite plans for the future and can only eagerly await the end of the war.</p>
<p>As The Last of The Regular Ships: The Shanghai Times reported that the US mail ship President Pierce arrived in Shanghai yesterday (10th) afternoon from South China and is scheduled to set sail for the US tonight (11th). The President Pierce is the last of the regular US mail ships currently passing through Shanghai. Industry sources say that other US mail ships may soon sail to Shanghai, such as four Danish ships that have been requisitioned in the Philippines and will replace the US President Lines' ships on Far Eastern routes. However, these ships will not sail on a regular schedule. Since the US President Lines' Pacific passenger ships have been fully requisitioned by the US government, the President Pierce, which is leaving tonight, has become the last regular ship leaving Shanghai. There are a large number of passengers boarding the ship in Shanghai, a rare sight since the American expatriates received evacuation orders and returned to their country in droves.</p>
<p>Mr. Bredsdorff Also Left Shanghai Yesterday: Mr. Bredsdorff, President of the Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross and Chairman of the British American Tobacco Company, retired at an advanced age and left Shanghai on the President Pierce last night with his family to return to the US, where he will settle in Seattle and spend his remaining years. Among those who went to the wharf last night to see him off were Dr. Garder Means, Vice President of the Red Cross, US Consul-General Lockhart, and Chinese and Western friends in Shanghai. He shook hands with each of those who saw him off, and could not help but feel sad at the abrupt departure from his second hometown of China.</p>
<p>Izumo Docks at Zhongzhan Wharf</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy's Third Fleet flagship Izumo, which left Shanghai on the 26th of last month to patrol, returned to Shanghai around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (10th) and docked at the China Merchants Bureau East Dock in Pudong, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Izumo moved to the original China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan Wharf yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Shanghai Manufacturers Will Go to India to Investigate the Yarn Industry, Forming an Investigation Group</p>
<p>Bombay, India, is one of the world's textile industry centers, almost as famous as Manchester, England. However, due to the European War, production rates have been reduced. Manufacturers in this city will unite with manufacturers staying in Hong Kong to form an investigation group to go to that place to investigate in order to develop Sino-Indian trade.</p>
<p>Forming an Investigation Group: Sino-Indian trade has seen great progress this year. Recently, due to the expansion of the European War, the place is even more welcoming of Shanghai products. Sales of cotton yarn, cloth, towels, and knitwear are increasingly strong. In order to promote trade, manufacturers are preparing to form an investigation group to go to Bombay, India, to investigate the yarn industry and study the working equipment status of the yarn factories there, as well as the production and sales situation, as a reference. They will conveniently go to various ports in Southeast Asia to visit and further contact manufacturers in various places to strengthen the sales organization. It has not yet been decided whether we will unite with those in the Hong Kong industrial community or only have manufacturers staying in Hong Kong conveniently go there.</p>
<p>Strong Sales in the South: Recently, the south sales of domestic yarn, cloth, towels, etc. in this city have suddenly become strong. In addition to a part being sold internally from Hong Kong via Guangzhou Bay and other places, the rest is resold to India, Myanmar, Borneo, the Philippines, and various ports in Southeast Asia. The Yuezhou ship the day before yesterday, the Mingsheng ship yesterday, and the Hanli ship, etc., all had large quantities of cotton yarn, cloth, towels, and socks transported to Hong Kong. Mr. Fox, the American member of the Equalization Fund Committee, and his assistant Mr. Taylor, came to Shanghai to inspect financial foreign exchange and completed their trip. They left Shanghai on the Yihong Mingsheng ship for Hong Kong the day before yesterday afternoon. They will discuss with the committees who have just arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing the stabilization of foreign exchange and other strategies. Mr. Fox will also contribute the results of his inspection to the Equalization Committee for reference. Once a concrete plan for stabilizing the statutory foreign exchange and maintaining the Black Mountain exchange rate is discussed and decided in Hong Kong, it will be implemented immediately. However, it can be asserted that the Shanghai Black Mountain exchange rate will continue to be maintained to safeguard the interests of legitimate merchants, but effective measures will be taken to eliminate speculative activities and the arbitrage of conspirators.</p>
<p>Maintaining Methods Kept Secret: A Reporter Learned from Banking Circles Yesterday that Mr. Fox's Trip to Shanghai, What are His Observations and What are His Plans? Outsiders Have No Way to Guess. However, the Shanghai Market has Paid Attention to and Discussed the Traces of Mr. Fox Everywhere. The General Public Speculated About Maintaining the Black Market and Eliminating Speculative Measures, and No Conclusion Could Be Reached. However, Banking Leaders Concerned with Foreign Exchange Also Kept Their Mouths Shut. But How to Rate the Level of Black Market Foreign Exchange is Also Impossible to Know. Because if the Maintaining Method Leaks, it Will Have a Significant Impact on the Financial Market and Create Opportunities for Speculators. In the Future, When There are Foreign Exchange Fluctuations in the Shanghai Market, the Equalization Association Will Maintain and Adopt the Entrustment Method, Which Will Never Be Publicly Disclosed.</p>
<p>Free Areas Have Been Unified: Regarding the foreign exchange of the Free Areas, it has been completely unified. The statutory exchange rate announced by the Central Bank every day remains the same and has never changed. For the import of necessities for legitimate merchants, those approved by the government are provided with foreign exchange by the Bank of China and the Communications Bank as much as possible, but applicants must pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the Bank of China and the Communications Bank. As for the export of major native products, those stipulated to settle foreign exchange are entitled to receive the difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the settling bank from the settling bank after the actual settlement amount is cleared. As for luxury goods such as foreign wine, orders have long been issued to prohibit imports.</p>
<p>Restricting the Supply of Consumables: Due to the Temporary Inability of the Government's Power in the Isolated Island of Shanghai Trade, Goods Prohibited from Import by the Government, Such as Luxury Goods Like Foreign Wine and Cigarettes, and Semi-Luxury Goods, Can Still be Freely Imported, and the Activities of Foreign Exchange Black Market Speculators Still Exist.

<h3>Adopt Fair and Effective Measures to Maintain Exchange Rates in Shanghai, Those Who Speculate and Profit Will Be Crushed, Restrictions Will be Added to The Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Luxury Goods</h3>
<p>Mr. Fox, the American member of the Equalization Fund Committee, and his assistant Mr. Taylor, came to Shanghai to inspect financial foreign exchange and completed their trip.

<h3>Guangdong Steamer Loaded with Machinery: Japanese Forcibly Ordered Unloading Ashore; British Consulate General Seriously Intervened, Expected to be Resolved; Rumor Says Dutch Consulate Lodged Protest, Japanese Side Enraged</h3>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Company's Guangdong steamer, which departed from Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (the 10th) bound for Singapore and Rangoon, was carrying several pieces of machinery belonging to the Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co., which the Japanese side mistakenly believed to be the property of the Chinese government. The Japanese navy at Wusong ordered the Guangdong steamer to return and dock at the Donggou Rongpu Bureau Wharf and dispatched troops to monitor it. This matter was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that regarding the Guangdong steamer incident, although various parties are negotiating, there was no progress yesterday. It is reported that the Japanese side firmly insisted that the machinery be removed before the steamer could be released. Therefore, a definitive solution is expected today.</p>
<p>#### Japanese Claim Captain Has Agreed to Unload Ashore</p>
<p>The English-language "North-China Daily News" reported that the Taikoo Company's "Guangdong" steamer left Shanghai southward with machinery yesterday (the 10th) afternoon. It was suddenly detained by the Japanese army outside Wusong. According to Japanese sources, the captain of the Guangdong has agreed to unload the machinery ashore at 10:00 a.m. this morning (the 11th) for inspection by the Japanese.</p>
<p>#### Machinery Originally Stored in the Bank of China</p>
<p>According to a Japanese army spokesperson, the Guangdong was intercepted because it was carrying 500 boxes of machinery previously stored in the Bank of China in Shanghai. This machinery was entrusted to Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co. to be transported from Shanghai to the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese authorities suspected that it was the property of Chongqing and intercepted the steamer for inspection. The captain of the Guangdong unloaded the machinery at Wusong this morning after being detained for several hours outside Wusong and continued southward. This statement has not been confirmed by Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co. or Taikoo Company, as both companies have remained silent on the matter.</p>
<p>#### British and Japanese Consuls General Consulted Yesterday</p>
<p>It is reported that the British and Japanese Consuls General in Shanghai consulted yesterday morning on the Guangdong steamer detention. It is also rumored that a representative from the Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the detention of the machinery, but the Japanese side did not accept it. The Dutch authorities also remained silent when reporters inquired.</p>
<p>#### Sunspots Disappear, Communications Return to Normal</p>
<p>Several days ago, transoceanic radio communications suddenly experienced interference, disrupting some overseas news. The cause was found to be sunspots, which caused magnetic storms that interfered with communications. Magnetic storms often coincide with disruptions in telephone and telegraph services. At their strongest, they can even completely disrupt transportation (electricity) tools. These phenomena are related to solar activity. The bright disturbances around sunspots are the most active areas, and because they are composed of gases, they can erupt suddenly within minutes. The same situation occurred in the second half of last year but soon disappeared and returned to normal. This past Monday, two sunspots appeared on the left and right sides of the sun, causing slight interference to radio and telephone communications for the past few days. It is now learned that they have gradually disappeared and returned to normal.</p>

<h3>Western Newspaper Reports CCP Manifesto: Implementing Democratic Governance, Loyal to the "Nation First" Concept, Uniting All Parties and Factions to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that CCP members in the border provinces of China are currently preparing for general elections and are following war strategies to unite all classes and parties to resist aggression and develop the concept of "Nation First." Rumors to the contrary are self-defeating. The CCP is sincerely loyal to the "Nation First" concept and therefore implements democratic governance in the administrative system without practicing communism. It protects private property and ownership and welcomes external participation, and foreign clergy are also very welcome. The aforementioned CCP procedures are contained in an English translation of a manifesto received by the editorial department of the "North-China Daily News." The manifesto is entitled "CCP Political Program for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" and was published in preparation for the general election in the border region. It is said that very few outsiders have obtained this manifesto.</p>
<p>#### Unite All Parties to Defend China</p>
<p>It contains the CCP's 21-point program, which will be vigorously implemented in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. This political program was "approved" by the CCP Central Political Bureau on May 1st of this year. The first point is to "unite all classes and parties loyal to the national war effort to mobilize and utilize all manpower, funds, and natural resources to defend mainland China, the Northwest, and the border regions, and to repel the violence of the invaders."</p>
<p>#### Protect Private Property and Vigorously Implement Democracy</p>
<p>The second point refers to the protection of private property and the freedom of external investment, trade, and industrial development. The manifesto also emphasizes "promoting a cooperative election system with all parties and popular organizations," stating that "if CCP members are elected to important positions in administrative organs, the CCP guarantees that two-thirds of the personnel in the administrative organs will be non-CCP members, and will implement extremely strict parliamentary democratic regulations."</p>
<p>#### Truly Implement the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>In addition, the religious beliefs and customs of the Hui people must be respected, and the "Regulations on the Protection of Property Rights in Counties East of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway" have been implemented, which proves that the CCP is indeed implementing the Three Principles of the People and maintaining the United Front.</p>
<p>#### Black Market Car Robbed in Front of the Nanjing Theater</p>
<p>At around 11 p.m. last night, in front of the Nanjing Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, a black market car (license number 7605) was suddenly approached by two bandits, each wielding a handgun. They forcibly drove the car away, and its whereabouts are unknown. Whether there were any passengers in the car and what the car was used for are still under investigation by the police authorities.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Staff Allowances: Implemented Periodic Adjustments; Allowance Amounts Determined Based on the Cost of Living Index; Indeed Sufficient to Stimulate Prices and Affect All Industries</h3>
<p>The case of the Public Works Department providing a general allowance increase to its staff was recommended by the Selection Committee last month and approved by the authorities, retroactive to May 1st. A temporary measure for increasing staff allowances was announced, and permanent measures were planned to adjust staff allowances in line with prices. However, the general public believes that the salary increase for Public Works Department staff is sufficient to stimulate rising prices and hopes that the authorities will adopt a cautious attitude towards such matters in the future. Following the temporary measures, the Public Works Department has decided to have the committee discuss and adjust staff allowance percentages once a month in the future. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>#### Monthly Review</p>
<p>According to the Public Works Department Information Office, regarding the issuance of allowances to staff, a temporary measure for increasing allowances was decided in June, implemented from May, and it was announced that any new measures adopted would be retroactive to May 1st in terms of benefits granted to staff. By the end of June, the department instructed the Selection Committee to meet and discuss a plan to stipulate a permanent method of periodic adjustment. This adjustment is necessary due to changes in the cost of living. After the committee meeting, it was believed that several sub-committees of the Selection Committee members should be appointed to study and decide on this issue on a monthly basis. The allowance amounts for May, June, and July have now been studied and approved by the Selection Committee and submitted to the Board of Directors of the department as follows:</p>
<p>A. For Chinese staff without contracts; B. For foreign staff and Chinese staff with contracts.</p>
<p>#### Percentage of Allowance Increase</p>
<p>The above measures are intended to allow lower-paid Chinese staff to maintain the same standard of living as in December of last year. However, the compensation received by other Chinese and foreign staff is only half or less than half of the increase in the cost of living since December of last year. The reduction in the July allowance for Chinese staff without contracts reflects the decrease in the cost of living in May and June. The Selection Committee uses a monthly cost of living index to determine the allowance amount for the corresponding month.</p>
<p>#### Over One Million Bags of Rice Stored in Warehouses; Warehouse Staff Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association's rice storage survey was unable to proceed last week due to the semi-annual closing of accounts in various industries, resulting in a postponed report.

The total rice storage in Chinese and foreign rice warehouses throughout the city has reached 1,173,468 bags, an increase of 116,882 bags compared to the 117th period, an average daily increase of over 8,348 bags.</p>
<p>#### Rice Warehouse Survey</p>
<p>This includes 50,043 bags at Old Taikoo, 78,468 bags at Kee Chong Ewo, 64,436 bags at Wah Soon, 131,749 bags at Kung Ho Shien Shun, 128,482 bags at Kung Si, 126,565 bags at Loong Mao, 69,893 bags at the Bank of China, 12,236 bags at the Sze Ming Bank, 56,139 bags at the Chekiang Industrial Bank, 24,087 bags at the Shih Yih Bank, 53,746 bags at Mao Tai, 74,732 bags at Taikoo, and 89,764 bags at Roosevelt. The above storage amounts are limited to various Chinese and foreign warehouses. The rice sold or stored in rice shops, the purchases made by citizens, and the orders placed and transported to Shanghai by various civil food organizations are not included in the survey, totaling approximately 2 million bags.</p>
<p>#### Warehouse Staff Resume Work</p>
<p>The bean and rice industry warehouse staff strike that had been deadlocked for many days has come to an end as the employer representatives have accepted the principles. The warehouse staff has accepted the persuasion of the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Workers' Union and resumed work yesterday. The proposed conditions will be resolved continuously, with further discussions scheduled for the 16th.</p>
<h3>Bandits Robbed Large Sum of Money, Police Detective Found to Have Embezzled It, Detective Flatly Denies It, Detained Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Ren Fengwu, a Chinese detective of the Central Police Department, and detective Huang Hairu, etc., previously apprehended four robbers, including Wang Yongqing, inside and outside the Chekiang Industrial Bank on Peking Road. Four cases were uncovered, as reported earlier. Wang has now confessed that on May 1st of this year, he and Tang Zhongyao (also known as Xiao Zhou), who has already been sentenced to imprisonment, robbed a rice merchant of 5,000 yuan in legal tender in front of the Natural Restaurant on Zhifu Road. When they passed through Wufu Lane on Tianjin Road, they were apprehended by Shao Jinglin, Chinese detective number 84 of the Old Zha Police Department. The detective took the money at the time and returned 25 yuan, instructing them to leave. Tang made the same confession during interrogation.

<h3>Two Lovely Child Refugees, Respectfully Appealing to Society, Already Admitted to Lida Academy as Free Students, Respectfully Requesting Assistance from All Sectors for Boarding and Other Expenses</h3>
<p>Received letters from two primary school students at the Child Refugee Education Center at 285 Rue Courbet in the French Concession, with lively and endearing writing. One is Ni Zhaoqi, 14 years old, from Zhenjiang; the other is Bao Jiazeng, 14 years old, from Jiading. Both lost their hometowns in the war and drifted to Shanghai. They were introduced to the Child Refugee Education Center and have now graduated this summer. They have both been admitted to Lida Academy as impoverished free students. However, although tuition is waived, books, boarding, and miscellaneous expenses are also considerable. The two students are poor and have no support, but their desire to learn and advance is truly commendable. We are making a special appeal to society for assistance. If kind-hearted people show sympathy and contribute financially, this newspaper will be happy to collect and forward it to the two students to help them achieve their goals. The letter from Ni Zhaoqi is reproduced below: Dear and Enthusiastic Editor:</p>
<p>I am a child refugee who has suffered due to the impact of war.</p>
<p>Since Zhenjiang was burned down by the flames of war, I followed my parents, siblings, and sisters, tearfully bidding farewell to the embrace of my beautiful hometown and drifting to Shanghai. Since then, the family's finances have been extremely strained. Fortunately, I was helped by philanthropists and introduced to the Shanghai Child Refugee Education Center to study, so I was able to receive a good education again, as if I had embarked on a new journey. This is the comfort I received in my misfortune.</p>
<p>Time dripped in the flowing water, and not even a single drop of water splashed up. Graduation is approaching in a hurry. There is an even more important and difficult problem pressing on my childish, innocent, and active heart! In the past few days, I, who am -4 years old, seem to have grown up several years. The jumping shadows, running shadows, and active shadows on the grass are all gone, and I am just immersed in silent contemplation. Why am I worried and troubled all day long? It is because this center does not run a middle school, my parents' pockets are empty, and who will provide me with money to go to middle school after I graduate from primary school? As for going to work, with my shallow knowledge and experience, where can I go to beg for a bowl of rice to fill my stomach? So my little heart is wounded and saddened by the pain of the world!</p>
<p>In my mind, I often think like this: Since I am a child refugee, the vast future will inevitably be hit by the waves of lack of money, but I must not be timid and discouraged. I must still muster the courage and think of a perfect way to break free from this shackles of extra money, move forward bravely, and the future will naturally be bright.</p>
<p>My tuition is not a problem, because I have passed the exam for a free place for impoverished students at Lida Academy, but there are still many expenses for books, boarding, etc., which I am unable to pay. Because of its lack of finances, this center does not help graduates with any miscellaneous expenses, so I still need to beg the enthusiastic gentlemen in society to be compassionate and help me, a child refugee. I am now like a ship without a rudder in the sea, wandering in the middle, seeing a future with achievements but unable to sail-forward, unable to row to the promised land. How unfortunate! How worthy of people's pity and sigh!</p>
<p>I am looking up, stretching out my hands, and sincerely asking your newspaper to cultivate me, so that my path will be fragrant, brilliant, and complete, ready to dedicate myself to the motherland in the future.</p>
<p>I am waiting for good news! Wishing the editor a pleasant summer! And wishing you success in your work!!</p>
<p>Child Refugee Ni Zhaoqi from the Child Refugee Education Center, respectfully saluting.</p>
<p>Also, Bao Jiazeng, from Jiading, Jiangsu, 14 years old, whose hometown was occupied and parents were scattered after the war, wandering in Shanghai, was introduced to the Child Refugee Education Center. He also graduated this summer and has been admitted to Lida Academy as an impoverished free student, but due to lack of funds for books, boarding, etc., he requests assistance from all sectors.</p>

<h3>The Comedy of American Conscription Hua Zhi</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of conscription in the United States, countless funny dramas have occurred in the thousands of conscription offices across the country. Some of these funny dramas are excusable, and some are absurd. It is enough to represent a glimpse of the American national character. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Conscription offices in various places are indeed welcoming to men with sound physical conditions, but they are closing their doors to men who are not sound. Dealing with these people who overestimate themselves is sometimes very tricky. Once, an officer angrily barged into the local conscription office and asked why they had sent a person with a chicken eye, a hernia, and partial paralysis to the military camp. The panicked conscription chief replied that this was his only way to get rid of the cripple, so as to avoid the person's persistent request to join the army. ,</p>
<p>Many clever men got married quickly when the conscription order was issued but not yet effective, thinking that he had the burden of a family and would have the right to avoid military service; but after marriage, they found that family life was far less good than military life and were willing to join the army immediately. The conscription office often receives letters from general wives asking for their husbands, the content of which is: "To the Honorable Sir: My wife and I got married, originally hoping to grow old together. But after a short time, my husband suddenly ran away to the army. Please return him to me."</p>
<p>It is also a problem that children far below the military age insist on enlisting. A conscription chief questioned a child who was applying for enlistment, "What will your parents say when they hear the news that you are going to run away?" The child was embarrassed and answered, "They will probably say: Go, little thing!" Another young man refused to enlist because he had to support his mother. The conscription office summoned his mother and asked her to prove that he could be a soldier. "I used to be a teacher," his mother said eloquently, "and I can still earn a living now." In this way, the people in the conscription office had no choice but to order the young man to stay at home, at least until his mother found a job.</p>
<p>Another polygamist did not want to support his first and second wives and their children, but listed his third wife as a dependent. The first wife was summoned to the conscription office to prove that what he said was indeed true. She hesitated and replied, "No, he doesn't even support me."</p>
<p>The enlistment of dancers has also become a problem in conscription offices. Dancers claim that his wonderful dance toes will lose their effectiveness if he wears military boots. But the authorities did not consider this a sufficient reason. Only one comedian was exempted by the conscription office because his female companion supported the family by performing, and if he enlisted, her life would be in dire straits.</p>
<p>Intellectuals are also dissatisfied with conscription. A pacifist was furious when he heard the news that he was being drafted, and pounded the table and said, "If you don't exempt me, I will sue the court. I will personally appeal to the President. I will fight, fight for my rights. one</p>
<p>Another objector, in view of the various tragedies during the Russian Revolution, decided to avoid all military actions. He used a typewriter to type a twenty-page article, telling the conscription staff about his Tolstoyan theories of peace and war. There was also a pacifist whose vision was even more far-reaching. He said that he believed in Chinese Taoism and wanted to be transformed without action. Enter the sage and transcend the ordinary.</p>
<p>Many unmarried Chinese youths in Chinatown cannot falsely claim to have dependents in China to seek exemption, and most of them obediently enlisted. The army authorities originally intended to promote them, but the laundries and snack shops they painstakingly ran had to close down due to lack of management. A clever overseas Chinese did not want to give up his booming laundry business. He said to the conscription staff, "I can't speak American." Unfortunately, he had already answered the questions of the physical examination officer in very good English. Now it is too late to escape.</p>

<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Lan Wen</p>
<p>Depressed days make life numb, and numb life makes days even more depressed. So everything is over. I forgot others, and others forgot me. Even I forgot myself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, reality is thorny, and I still remember that I am living in this place, in this era. So I still can't help but feel and think. Logically speaking, this should be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>But, the shadow of loneliness is still so familiar. Is loneliness the inevitable fate of young people?</p>
<p>Some friends ran many places with the mood of "doing something", covered with the dust of foreign lands. He ran from here to there, from far to even farther. The dream of home is also becoming more and more distant.</p>
<p>A light of ideals; drove him, and finally he forgot himself, forgot the past. He suffers, he endures hardships; he does not seek fame or profit. All he has is that mood of "doing something". This is also slightly meager, but can you say that he is not realistic?</p>
<p>However, what greeted him was too much frustration and obstruction. A determined person may know how to fight back and win; unfortunately, God was negligent when creating people: he forgot to impart perseverance to everyone without bias, like ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. But heredity left people with a not-so-lovely inertia. It makes people understand what it means to be tired. Tired of life. So be quiet and silent.</p>
<p>Across the sky and across the sea, my friend's father is back. The bustle of the foreign country has increased with age, and the prosperity is better than in the past. But, clever sir, what can you say he can tell me, and what can my father tell him? Sitting together for a long time, we seem to know quite a lot. But the summer night is shorter!</p>
<p>Medicine</p>
<h3>Blood Transfusion into Bone</h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>According to recent reports, blood can be transfused into the bone marrow as well as into the blood vessels. Some doctors have tried this new method of blood transfusion seventeen times on fourteen patients, only one of which had poor results.</p>
<p>The doctors said: The liquid injected into the bone marrow can flow into the blood without any changes, and it flows almost as fast as the liquid injected directly into the blood vessels.</p>
<p>The hollow tubes in the bones cannot replace blood as the channel for the flow of blood or other liquids injected into the patient's body. However, sometimes it is difficult for doctors to inject liquids into blood vessels, or they cannot inject them at all. For example, patients have wounds all over their bodies, burns all over their bodies, swollen skin and flesh, are suddenly shocked, their blood vessels are not well developed, or their blood vessels are blocked. In these cases, bone marrow transfusion may be able to bring the dead back to life. The blood vessels of infants are generally not well developed, so it is difficult or even impossible for doctors to perform intravenous injections.</p>
<h3>Mobile Basement</h3>
<p>— Revised</p>
<p>American inventors have recently created a mobile basement called the "Underground Trailer" for use as a bomb shelter in air raids. This new type of shelter is equipped with beds, stoves, bathtubs, and all other facilities in a car trailer. All "Underground Trailers" have standard dimensions (8 feet high and 12 feet long), and the roof is made of 3/8-inch thick corrugated steel plates. Each part can be disassembled, transported to any safe and convenient cave for assembly, without the need for lifting machinery.</p>

<p>Ten Loving Father's Heart</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, tears welled up in his eyes like a spring.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang tried his best to avoid looking at him, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"You are a child, you can't endure hardship; as for me, I'm so old, I can endure some more hardship. You don't need to worry about that."</p>
<p>"No, I don't believe this kind of talk, people have never been like this!" Mei Bao said stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Child, be obedient, just listen to me!" Qiu Haitang still used this set of words to answer her. "Anyway, I want to love you like this. You have never quarreled with me about what to eat or what to wear. Child, believe me! I am willing to endure some hardship, not entirely for you!"</p>
<p>"Don't say any more, Dad, it's the same old tune again!" Mei Bao pouted her little mouth and said.</p>
<p>Now, they were almost walking into the village entrance. Mei Bao occasionally looked</p>
<p>Avoid suffering from dampness and summer heat No.</p>
<p>Looking behind, he saw Mei Ruchun, a ten-year-old child living on the left side of his house, running barefoot in the rain, his whole body soaked like a drowned chicken.</p>
<p>"Dad, you are too good to me!" She looked at the completely dry clothes on her body and said with extremely emotional excitement.</p>
<p>"No, child, I should treat you like this. You will definitely be much happier elsewhere than here...!" Qiu Haitang almost blurted out the secret hidden in her heart to her daughter, but finally tried her best to hold back.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mei Bao was an extremely clever child. Although she only heard such a vague sentence, a cloud of doubt immediately rose in her heart.</p>
<p>"Elsewhere? Dad, if I'm not with you, where else can I go? Your words are really strange!" She opened her eyes wide and stared firmly at Qiu Haitang's uneven face, as if trying to see her father's secret from those two scars.</p>
<p>"You could have gone to your mother's place." Qiu Haitang glanced at the rain in the sky and said nonchalantly. (156)</p>

<h3>Dog's Air-raid Shelter</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>In order to protect innocent animals in wartime, the British have organized the National Animal Air Raid Prevention Committee, which is responsible for protecting various domestic animals. If there are any displaced animals, they will find a new family for them. In Kensington, solid concrete air-raid shelters have been built for domestic dogs. Most domestic dogs are trained in advance, and as soon as they hear the alarm, they can automatically run to the air-raid shelter. The shelters are separated by wire mesh, with each dog occupying a room, and chained to prevent ignorant dogs from going out during the air raid. They will regain their freedom only after the alarm is lifted.</p>

<h3>Soviet Film Industry in Wartime</h3>
<p>— Jin Chuan</p>
<p>One photography studio covers an area of ​​four square miles. Other important film industry locations include Leningrad, Baku, and cities near the Caspian Sea. The Soviet film industry is quite developed, and many of the equipment is imported from the United States and Germany. There are 500 cinemas in Moscow alone, 200 of which show educational films, completely free of charge. The Soviet film industry is also trying its best to learn from Hollywood, and sends many experts and filmmakers to Hollywood every year to visit and study. But even so, they feel that Hollywood should learn more from them. They claim that whether in terms of artistic or commercial value, Soviet films far exceed Hollywood's productions.</p>
<p>But in the Soviet film capital, there are no people with salaries of hundreds of thousands, and no one has a weekly salary as high as £1,000 like Clark Gable or Garbo. But then again, it would be a big mistake to think that the salaries of Soviet film workers are completely uniform. It is true that every worker in the Soviet Union can find a job, but the size of the salary depends on the nature of the work. An ordinary electrician, recording engineer, etc. can get 200 rubles per month, while administrative personnel and stars can get 1,500 rubles per month. The above is the general situation before the war, and of course there will be some differences after the war.</p>
<h3>A Critique of China Travel's "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm," a four-act tragic drama, is a tearjerker known to women and children alike, so it hardly needs any introduction from me. However, this time, China Travel's performance at the Tianchan Theater has a slight change in the lineup because Tang Ruoqing is unable to perform due to a contract with Huanian. The cast is as follows: Sun Jinglu as Sifeng, Tang Huaiqiu as Zhou Puyuan, Ge Xin as Lu Gui, Chou Quan as Lu Dahai, Wu Jingping as Zhou Chong, Xia Duowen as Zhou Fanyi, Zhang Xuemei as Lu Shiping, and Zhao Shu as Zhou Ping.</p>
<p>I don't think this lineup is very balanced. The skill levels are too far apart, and the acting achievements are worlds apart. The good ones are truly good, leaving you speechless with admiration, while the bad ones are truly bad, making you so frustrated that you can hardly breathe.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu's Sifeng, from the moment she appears on stage, speaks in a clear and sweet Mandarin accent. From the first act to the fourth, she consistently captures the audience's hearts. Her facial expressions and demeanor are natural and lively. Tang Huaiqiu's Zhou Puyuan has a special style when he comes out from backstage. His left hand is stiff, and his body is rigid, giving people a subtle thrill. Ge Xin's Lu Gui is very dutiful in his performance, but it doesn't seem to be expressive enough in terms of personality. We know that Lu Gui, in Cao Yu's pen, is a villain who is insidious, playful, muddle-headed, good at flattering, and bullies the weak and clings to the strong. Ge Xin's expression is only superficial. I saw Wang Xianqi's Lu Gui before, and he was much stronger and more profound. Chou Quan's Lu Dahai is very fitting for the role, appearing foolish but with a passionate heart and full of courage. After he appears on stage, he is best able to focus the audience's attention. Wu Jingping's Zhou Chong lacks innocence and is almost stiff. Xia Duowen's Zhou Fanyi completely imitates Tang Ruoqing's style. She never relaxes her grip on this character from beginning to end, but unfortunately, she is too calm and dull. Zhang Xuemei's Lu Shiping is only seen walking around on stage, and we don't see any inner expression from her. In fact, this character is also very easy to please the audience. Zhao Shu's Zhou Ping looks too young, his intonation is not enough, and his movements are also awkward. In terms of effects, because the stage is too big, it is not realistic enough. Only a few dog barks still make people yearn for it.</p>
<h3>Words to Zhou Xuan</h3>
<p>— Wei Han</p>
<p>Three Solutions</p>
<p>Since the marital change of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua, there have been many records and commentaries from the outside world, but there has been no solution. It is a pity! Here are three solutions, sent to Zhou Xuan, hoping she will adopt them.</p>
<p>(1) Reconcile and get back together. If there is any more abuse, immediately get a divorce.</p>
<p>(2) Separate, devote to art, or leave Shanghai and transfer to work in the Great Rear Area.</p>
<p>(3) Divorce, and from then on, do not associate with anyone who is said to be related to the marital change, to prove that this change was purely due to disagreement.</p>
<p>Iron Fan Princess Completed by the End of August by Hai Xing</p>
<p>The feature-length cartoon "Iron Fan Princess," which the Wan brothers have been working on for more than a year, is now eight or nine tenths completed and is expected to be fully completed by the end of August. This film will be the third work after the opening of Xinhua (now the Great Shanghai Theater). At the same time, the interlude song "Journey to the West," sung by Han Langen and Yin Xiucen (the model for Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie), was recorded yesterday at the Guolian General Factory in the Lilac Garden.</p>

<p>(21) Li Shengzao</p>
<p>Li Shengzao is the sixth son of the late famous Kunqu opera artist Li Shoufeng (Shoufeng, along with painted-face Li Shoushan and martial artist Li Xinfu, were brothers). He began studying at the age of eleven when he entered the Fuliancheng Opera School, studying the Laosheng (old male) role under Jin Sihong Cai Yuting. Cai was one of the major contributors to the fame of Ma Lianliang. Seeing that Shengzao's singing and elegant figure were just like Lianliang's, he taught him to specialize in the spoken parts of the acting. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), Cai led the disciples of the Sheng class of the Fu Society south for the first time. Shengzao's name was prominently displayed, and the audience praised his acting and recitations as being close to Lianliang's, while his singing was even better. He was the only Laosheng among the fourth class of the Fu Society. His wife is Gao, the daughter of Gao Qingkui. Qingkui also taught him the plays he excelled at. Last year, he brought the Kun Dan (female role) Tong Zhinan south to work for Huang Jin, and his skills have improved and his reputation has grown. His fifth brother, Sheng Yin, initially studied martial arts, but now manages all of Shengzao's theatrical affairs.</p>

<h3>A Rare Flower in the Rain of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: As Helpless as Ning Wuzi</p>
<p>The old monk chanted "Amitabha" with his palms together and said, "Please follow this humble monk, Generals." So Liu Yinying and Xu Jing led their horses in. The old monk closed the temple door again, led them through a dilapidated hall, and settled them in a cloud room. He said tremblingly to the two men, "This small temple is in this mountain hollow, and the incense is very scarce. There were originally three or four monks and a incense server in the temple, but now because there is war at Ningwu Pass, they are all afraid that the bandits will come to burn and kill, so they have long avoided it. Only this old monk is old and frail, so I have stayed here alone. If you two generals have any orders, this humble monk will naturally comply." Xu Jing said, "Do you have any rice in your temple? Please cook us a pot of porridge, my stomach is a little hungry, but I don't need anything else." The old monk agreed repeatedly and left. Liu Yinying saw that Xu Jing's arm was still dripping blood, so he went forward and slowly rolled up Xu Jing's left arm, seeing that a piece of flesh had been cut off below the elbow, so Xu Jing's body was also stained with a lot of blood. Liu Yinying tore a relatively clean piece of cloth from his soiled battle robe and carefully wrapped the wound for him. He asked, "Brother Jing, how did you get hurt?" Xu Jing told Liu Yinying about the experience of rushing out of the pass to fight today and thanked him for his help. Then he asked him, "General Zhou and I have been looking forward to your virtuous brother coming to help us kill the bandits every day, and you have also personally promised that you can serve the country when the soldiers arrive. Why haven't you come all this time, making people look forward to you in vain? With your good skills, why don't you serve the country at this time? When are you waiting? I can't help but be suspicious." Liu Yinying frowned and replied, "Brother Jing, you don't know that although I want to come and kill the bandits together, my aunt will definitely not let me go out when she finds out. Later, my aunt heard that the bandits attacked Daizhou and was frightened, and she was bedridden again, and she would not allow me to go down the mountain. I was very anxious. When I heard that Daizhou had fallen, General Zhou retreated to Ningwu, and the old hero Wang had died on the battlefield, I was both respectful and sad. I was very concerned about your safety and thought you had retreated to Ningwu with General Zhou. (113)</p>
