<p>社評</p>
<h3>一　凍結資金與中國經濟</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統發表凍結所有在美之中日兩國資金，與英加政府宣布凍結所有在英帝國內之日本資金消息之傳來，猶如靑天霹靂，滬人士固無不大受震撼，惶惶不可終日。一般市民所引爲最疑懼者，則唯恐物價之將趨極度在漲，而生活勢必遭受最殘酷之壓迫！此在驚弓之烏，固不足怪，但此爲滬市之特殊現象，誠不可不注意者也。何以言之？請申其說。</p>
<p>在過去數十小時內，道聽塗說，無不含有恐怖之毒素，此為投機家之鬼蜮伎倆。早爲達人所識破，而在平民，因未見正確之議論，往往受彼等之愚弄而輕中其計。此在過去遇有重大改革時，靡不有類似之現象，凡經濟基礎建築於投機之機構上者，固無從糾正之也。孰知今日凍結資金之辦法非特無害於民生，抑且為挽救民生最有效之對策，而在此一籌莫展之際，實爲我國有史以來最足稱頌之設施，極應受全國人民之歡迎與擁護者也。</p>
<p>先請言上海之匯市。因美匯之不能如往昔之自由供給。整個之外匯市塲，似將受其牽制之影響，而陷於停滯之境地。在表面視之，此說似乎近情。但按諸實際，則固有大謬不然者。蓋美國雖不以無限之美匯自由供給中日兩國，但仍須繼續供給其他民治國或民治區域。因此中日兩國之投機家仍得與其他民治國之投機家爲間接之外匯交易。而實現其市塲上之套做。且除英美外匯外，其他各處之外匯如港幣，菲幣，越幣，日金等：仍可爲無限制之交易，因此仍可套做英美外匯。况美國已指定十四銀行爲特准美匯交易之市塲，將美匯供給正當商業之需要，足徵美匯之供給，決無中斷之虞。由此可知滬市之外匯市塲，絕不發生任何惡劣影響。而由於套　之使得，唯恐美匯之統制，不能如預定之嚴密，此固特殊國際市塲之癥結所在也。但可斷言者，外匯之投機，決無如以往之得肆意妄為，而外匯之購售，亦必須相當之手續，投機之風，於是可以稍戢，此即凍結資金之極大功用。</p>
<p>次論滬市之物價等問題，就表面觀之，由於美匯之不再自由供給，我人不復能自由使用美匯以購買應用物品，因此將趨在漲。顧揆諸事實；美國政府對於正當商業仍必供售美匯，前已言之，故是項疑慮，即應泳釋。且因前述之套做外匯關係，商人之得自由使用各國貸幣，與往昔並無大異，是以物價不應發生高漲之趨勢。假令滬市發生最惡劣之環境、竟與美國斷絕一切商業關係，滬市之物價亦不應趨漲，蓋除汽油，火油以及少數之工業用品外，所有日常必需用品，槪可由其他方面運滬應市。且一般市民所急需之日用品，概可由國內供給，故彼等生活所需絕不受外匯之影響。即以食米而論，由於日本之南進。售價似將趨高，而不知此番凍結資金，日金最受打擊，而其幣値必暴跌無疑。反之。我國法幣因受美匯之統制與用途之限制，反得增值，故米價更有低廉之希望，而絕無高漲之理由，此又為凍結資金之絕大貢獻。</p>
<p>總之，此番凍結資金對於我國有百利而無一弊。爲市民者固應鎭靜，以觀後效，而在投機家，固急應改變方針，而共謀改造全國之經濟基礎。設有欲藉此操縱物價，以圖漁利、其將必受嚴重之敎訓也無疑。</p>
<h3>二　英美的還擊</h3>
<p>正在日本趾高氣揚，宣佈法日成立協定，共同肪衛越南的時候，英美兩國政府却同時宣佈凍結日本在英美兩國及不列顚帝國各屬地的資金，雖然中國資金也在凍結之列，但這是出於中國政府的特別請求，其目的祗在幫助中國制止日本利用淪陷區商民所有的外匯，所以就英美此舉的本質而論，正是百分之百對於日本此决侵越行動的一種報復。</p>
<p>據華盛頓方面電訉，凍結資金不過是許多對日制裁辦注中之一端而已，其餘如完全禁運與抵制日輪等措置。也早已在美國當局考慮之中，今後祇要日本作進一步行動，所有各種經濟武器勢必一一予以運用，一直到雙方發生武力衝突或日本知難而退爲止。僅就目前論，這凍結資金的辦法，雖不能說已足制日本經濟的死命，但至少可以想像到日本在經濟上乃至國防上行將遭遇極其重大的打擊。因爲日本自侵華四年多以來，其唯一賴以維持本國經濟的，便是對外貿易，允其是對美國及英國遠東各屬地的貿易，前者以生絲爲大宗，後者以棉織品爲大宗，今後一切金融交易旣須受許可證制度的限制，英美政府自不難隨時用以限制日貨的輸入，從而陷日本出口工業於困境，這是第一種必然的打擊；其决。日本所賴以作戰或賴以生存的若千項重要資源，如美國的汽油戰具，澳洲的棉花羊毛等，又必須用美金英鎊去償付貨價，今後資金旣遭凍結，在許可證操縱之下，當然又須受到莫大的限制，而使日本逐漸陷於無法繼續作戰或無法維持其基本工業的境地，這是第二種必然的打擊。</p>
<p>不髯唯是，美國政府除於昨日起宣佈凍結令外，同時並由夏威夷軍事當局宣佈「戒備狀態」，如果再拿諾克斯海長隔昨所說「美國海軍已準完成」的話相印證，可見華府當局的作爲，不但沒有像近日外間所傳，對日抱有絲毫綏靖企圖，反而證　羅斯福總統一貫的反侵略政策，祇有愈加堅決愈加明期；益以年來英國在新嘉坡及馬來緬甸的積極充實兵力，荷印當局過去的不畏强力，毅然拒绝日本苛求，中國當局的明白宣佈將於今秋反攻，以及澳洲，菲律滨，紐西蘭諸地同仇敵愾，更不難意料到今後日本如果不知進退、繼续蠢动，則中英美荷四國甚至中英美荷　五國的遠东聯合戰綫，定必由相互默契的階層，進展至具體行動的節段。</p>
<p>檢討日本此决進一步壓榨越南的意義，原不過是近衛中的一種「不得已而求其次」的辦法，也就是郭泰祺外長所說日人希望「代價小而收穫多」的一種偸鷄政策，却萬想不到這種避重就輕的做法，竟依然招致了英美的重大還擊；因此，今後遠東時局的演變，將悉以日本的動態爲轉移；假使東京眞有決心，眞有膽量和英美一爭長短，則第一步當然是實行報復，凍結英美在日本及其勢力圈內的資金，同時則悍然佔領越南全境，以準備次一期的軍事行動，這樣，英美當然也不甘示弱，進一步對日實施全面的經濟封鎖，一直到雙方實行火併。報載日方定於明日召開特別樞密會議，討論緊急問題，此會當然與日本未來的行動有關。預料不出五日，遠東大局如何演變，便可有一個揭曉，世人面臨這樣重大的時局轉捩點，惟有磨礪以須，各自警策，準備應付一切最惡劣的事變，不必驚慌，更無所用其悲觀，因爲今後的一切變動，正是國際大局澄淸過程中最應有，抑且最有利於民治陣綫的發展，經過一番艱難奮鬥，必能撥霧見日，重現光明。</p>

<p>本報嘗謂上海匯市、牽涉太多、百孔千瘡、補救匪易、以如此複雜問題、為國策所繫、勢必於國計民生、兼籌並顧、內憂外患、利害輕事、比較得失、而後嚴厲取締投機買賣、及陰謀套匯、並須採取有效杜絕之方法、一面對於正當商業合法需要、盡力維持、當時以之希望於福克斯來滬返港之後、不意事隔兩週、因緣時會、已露端倪、而在此兩週中、只見日商出售美匯、收進法幣、為數甚鉅、月暈而風、礎潤知雨、以是知去凍結資金前途不遠、昨日本報外匯、仍以「獨有蟲內賣美匯」為標題、弦外之音、於此可見、不圖昨晨即有美國凍結日資金之舉、中國政府不惜犧牲、亦自在凍結之列、此種毒蛇螫手、壯士斷腕之精神、固所欽佩、實早為應有之舉、而獨遲至今日始見者、正以英美商人不脫妥協、不欲推動其金融上之勢力、商業上之運用、用以衝突上作緩和、政治上作綏靖、遂使上海黑匯市塲、無法管制、皆為一有人欲之私、即有所蔽、而所見皆非、即如手中有外匯者、做套利者、投機買賣者、自不贊成外匯管制、市上愈混沌愈好、好往混水摸魚、此惡劣心理、正與米商南進、一般無二、</p>
<p>如今已實行凍結、昨日各種商品無一不飛騰、此種心理、以為外匯一朝凍結、求取不易、法幣將失所支持、而連日日鮮鈔票竟無日不漲、用以反映上海商人之心理、實至無謂、要知凍結中國外匯、實際上只凍結淪陷區內之外匯、自由中國之外匯、本來在統制之列、正當商業之需求外匯者、照樣供給、並無不便、惟獨上海天津等處向來放任、予取予求、一無限制、此漏巵不杜塞、則所謂凍結之效果等於零、故必聯帶牽涉、方收全功、但可信中國政府決不能瞙視淪陷區民眾之福利、正當商業應有之活動、逆料其必有善後辦法、資其運用、此其一、上海尙有不少英美商業則與英美商業往來、如可保證其不影戤、不外洩、旣是ABC「一鼻管出氣」、取得外匯、自必便利、此其二、人民生活必需品所需之外匯、中國政府在可靠之審核制度下、仍予以維持、惟如奢侈品及不必需品之外匯供給、自必加以限制、此其三、至擁有外匯者、亦不必亡生疑慮、蓋中國政府決不使中外正當商入財產上受損失、此其四、惟拋空朋友、不無吃緊、欲補無往、故昨日匯價反縮此亦應得之咎、惟希望政府旣將外匯統一其供求、自可調整其趨勢、維持國計民生雙方兼顧之應有水凖、提高法幣價值、俾紓民生之困、此不僅淪陷區民生為然、即自由區民生、亦有相聯而至之影響、故盼早進一步之表示、以慰天下蒼生之望、</p>
<p>空頭被迫大量補進</p>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌各匯未更、英美匯暗市、先鬆後突劇緊、乃於晨間後日商銀行兜拋美匯無一應者、目英行匯豐亦有售出、美金賣　至五元四〇六二五、英匯三辦士二五、詎至九點半忽聞英國政府宣佈凍結日本及中國淪陷區資金、本市投機家現居空頭地位、羣起傾補、在混亂中、為數極巨、中途英美商行陸續售出、奈金價飛漲、投機扒風有增無已、於午刻美匯緊至五元一二五、英金三辦士一四〇六二五、後美金獨稍回硬、終乃英匯軋緊仍巨、半日交易大盛、華商約扒美金一百五十萬元左右、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>美緊五元一二五</p>
<p>自晨外電、英印銀市均跌、美銀未更、各國英美對外匯兌均平、中央掛牌各匯勿更、內盤早開銀行賣價現貨英匯三辦士二三四三七五、美金五元三四三七五、開後三井三菱正金等行來塞出八月美金五元四〇六二五亦無一應者、聞匯豐售本月五元三七五、外銀行互做五元四〇六二五、市況步鬆、英金亦硬至三辦士二五、匯豐掛牌均平、白銀平衡稅低二五、計徵百分之二四·二五後、外電傳來、投機家羣起補空翻多、爭扒七八月五元三七五未獲、再推五元三一二五及二八一二五、時美銀行稍有供意、十點左右回硬至五元三一二五可結、奈人心已向上、十點半後、外銀行供意復淡、投機扒風再起、競結七八月五元二五及五元一八七五、近午更緊至五元一二五、英匯亦緊至三辦士一四〇六二五、均已緊至匯豐掛牌之下、該行小櫃檯美匯亦由五元三一二五軟至五元一二五、、於午收前、外商銀行見貴稍供、美金回硬至五元二一七八五、正午收市上、現貨至八月期均英匯三辦士一四〇六二五、美金五元一八七五、比前日晚收現期貨均緊〇九三七五、美匯緊一五六二五、</p>
<h3>金市塲　突起巨變　現貨做七千四百元</h3>
<p>昨日金市粭赤暗盤、忽起驚人巨變、先跌曾破入六千五百元關後、突狂漲、竟飛出六千六百元外、各方人心由疲驟然轉堅、乃初因日銀行兜售外匯乏人過問、故在證券幫匯票商賣勢下、退見六千四百八十二元、距至九點二十八分、路透電傳美國政府宣佈同時凍結中日兩國資金、美匯在投機家一百五十萬元補空扒風中、與英匯均猛堅、塲內劇烈買風亦起、滬西幫義元德孚·益大（進八九千兩）、新豐永等傾進翻多、雖恒記（出一萬五千兩）、大豐（出一萬兩）、天元等一再力售、供求依然懸殊、且散戶已翻多、有抬無撳、價越盤越高、飛達六千六百七十元高價、終稍回、續軋升九十四元、收後漲勢重熾、上半日交易十餘萬兩、下午週六無市、塲外再升至六千六百六十元有求無供、掉期（七月轉入八月）賣方貼出予買方五十元未成交、現金飛漲尤銳、已打破去年五月六日之七千二百五十元歷來紀錄、再創七千四百元空前高價、上午由中興出成記二十兩、德成四十兩、價為七千三百元、午刻已升至七千三百五十元、下午七千四百元、某金號曾有售出、軋升二百三十元、飾金步高二十元、亦創七百六十元、高價、</p>
<p>期貨市塲風擴大</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、因外匯報鬆、日行出美金五元四〇六二五無對手、人心大疲、故在賣風中九點十五分開市、即已跌至六千五百元、計開低十六元、益大·新豐永·熾大來售出、散多傾軋、價續下跌至六千四百八十二元、俄見益大·新豐永忽來猛烈復進、散戶本在驚奇之際、利多消息傳來、外匯在投機扒風中、五元三一二五亦難售、買風擴大、立泰·義元·鼎盛·仁承永·德孚·同康永四起傾進、散戶翻多亦猛進、價頓飛上一百元、哄達六千五百八十元、十點光景、美金五元三一二五復可結、且鑫源·天元·同康永·恒記·大豐均力售、頓見回小至六千五百三十元、十點二十分、外匯又在投機扒風中步緊忽銳、利多謠傳更盛、義元·益大·新豐永·德孚·立泰再起傾進、同康永時爭進尤巨、價再飛上一百四十元、哄達六千六百七十元、午刻美金稍回至五元二一八七五可結、大豐·天元·恒記仍售、德孚復出、始見回降六十元、正午收市六千六百十元、比前日晚收價續漲九十四元、照八月美金五十一八七五結價、為六千七百十三元、計撳一百〇三元、收後又起買風、升至六千六百四十五元、上半日有一百八十八元上落、下午塲外價升至六千六百六十元有買戶、現金號之本牌金售價七千五百元、收價在七千四百元內、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金亦創空前高價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行初掛七百四十元、十點三刻升五元、十一點又漲五元、十二點高五元、下午四點再升五元、達七百六十元、收進減四十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣無一不漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、粭赤期現俱漲、英美金鎊因亦猛漲四元、英金票漲起一元、美金票開盤一千八百七十一元、開後利記盈泰來等售出、退為六十四元、嗣忽順泰永祥興寶祥等力購、抬至一千九百十三元、順泰永轉賣、正大亦售、退為一千八百九十五元收盤、比上日軋升二十四元、現貨為十八元九角、香港票趨勢亦堅、此外如新加坡·安南·羅比·坎拿大·菲列賓·等票均趨漲勢、日金票及朝鮮一致挺漲、前者高至二元一角、後者升為一元七角四分、</p>
<h3>證券　凍結聲中　債市無所措手</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市因謠言龐雜、莫衷一是、國外消息非常複雜、美國凍結中日資金、上海美國駐防軍隊、有奉令預備隨時撤退之謠言、公債從業者多數未知若何措手、按理應看小、而市塲初開即小、半日多方惟恐其欲墜、奮起拉抬、以亂人目、多數正在莫衷一是之際、見此即亦盲從買進、丙種由六十九元三角開盤、經過一度稍事盤旋後、即見逐步上騰、見七十一元高價、鴻大·聯益·協興元·同康·恒康·買進、聯和·益昌·大豐·潤德·賣出、但進銳退速、再敲破七十一元、前途變化正多、仍難抱樂觀、結果再漲五角半至九角半、成交約二百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交五洲藥房股票五十股、價為一百七十元五角、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市塲大受震盪　浮空抵補：雙馬新價一六四九元</h3>
<p>盤旋多日之紗市、昨則發生極大的變化、此因美國對日凍結資金、連中國亦在此列、於是市塲震盪、投機買風突然狂熾、一般浮戶處此環境之下、祇得急於抵補、情況當然上騰、不過實際交易、依然清寂如恒、所以漲勢為迂　、本日之頂高峰價已穿過七月三日之一千六百四十二元、中途回降至一千五百二十二元、今則大價已達一千六百四十九元、昨上午二十支雙馬高價為一千六百四十九元、低價為一千六百零五元、午後因週尾向例無成交、但遇大波浪來、昨又活動了初做一千六百三十八元、漲至一千六百四十六元、又回鬆一千六百三十九元、最後價為一千六百四十六元有人欲進云、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因美棉續昂、人氣挺秀、首盤價為一千六百十元、少頃漲至一千六百十三元、旋聞標金開市後、忽跳七八七元之譜、外匯改編、市塲買風驟起、漲至一千六百十八九元、在此有一度上上下下、豈料將近十一時左右、聞國外電訊已到、中日資金皆已凍結、於是投機買戶、紛紛活動、塲中買聲震天、市盤一出一千六百四十元、直見上騰至一千六百四十九元、繼後現銷不旺、及盈利人吐出、標金亦回下、跌至一千六百三十元、收盤後價回至一千六百三十七元、查半日間成交統計七千六百七十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市況、晨初開市、趨勢尙參差不定、市價近疲而遠堅、緣浮多在近期轉賣、尙疲一元半、但拍至遠月、因買戶見增、九月忽漲五元、十月漲七元、迨十時以後、突聞美國凍結日本資金、而美棉又告劇漲、金價亦猛昂、斯時買戶蠢起、空頭不利紛補、價遂一度昇騰、八月期竟高漲至一千五百零六元、九月期一千五百六十六元、十月期一千五百八十三元、嗣後以漲勢太猛、引起一部份多頭乘機出籠、各月俱回落十七元至二十三元、午收八月期比上日仍暴漲三十三元半、九月期漲三十一元、十月期漲二十元、成交數量激增、半日共成交二萬二千包、比上日大增一萬五千一百包、午後因週六停市、再將半日間開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>棉市前進亦速</h3>
<p>現棉情況大堅、一以美棉狂騰不已、二則外匯凍結、紗市大跳棉市隨之前進、不過廠方心思較平、然投機買賣大增、市價步騰矣、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉洋行定貨交易、市況雖屬堅昂、但因國際情勢、非常混亂、及上海地位漸趨惡劣而購意消沉、昨日除花號家略有羅致現貨之意向外、定棉貿易絕無過問也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因大眾購意熱烈而活濃堅昂、同時更因棉產收長穫情形見劣、及華盛頓政治報告、農業貸款部堅決反對、釋放貸棉而猛漲、結果昨日收盤價格、較之上日漲四十二至四十八磅首不等、</p>
<p>又電去年八月一日起、至今年七月二十五日止、美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者售出而跌、但後又因股票市塲等市況堅昂而回漲、結果收盤價格、漲跌一二羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市況、因美棉高漲而看高四·四五羅比、</p>
<h3>藥材　藥芡略鬆</h3>
<p>藥芡近以粵港兩幫去胃轉寂、而市價已到高峯、故趨勢稍見回軟、但存底終屬不多、一時未見過小、比前約降十元之譜、白皮藥芡叫二百十五元、以次照退、</p>
<h3>糧食　米商無所不用其極　借端又將來價抬　實際上存米充牣　洋米暢通仍如故</h3>
<p>洋米昨早市尙因存到兩多、而見軟弱、蓋本市存米公開調查者已有一百二十七萬四千八百五十二包、加入未經調查者、總計有二百數十萬石之鉅、本街有港米供應、外埠迄乏暢化、如此數量、足以抵制市價之上升、故早市曾見回小一元左右、不料資金凍結之說一傳、立即引起投機幫之活動、買聲哭起、興奮異常、市價逐喊逐高、早晨疲風盡被衝破、人心激昂、有加無已、蓋市面平疲已久、一經刺激、宜其加量興奮、拋頂宮踢皮球之流、更從而活躍、小絞米早市自一百十六元小至一百十四五元、又自一百十六元至一百十八元、英華司現貨自一百四十四元到一百四十六元、期自一百四十四元半至一百四十六元半、二號暹邏一百四十一元、他如敏黨普通貨開至一百二十三元半、次一百十八元、特別一百三十元、茄佛米大市一百二十二元三角、中關一百十七元、次一百十五元八角、特別自一百二十七元至一百二十九元、僅東京　尖以去路不廣、略見帶緊、開中次貨一百零九元一百零五元、高伙食米一百十二元、碎尖九十一元、次至八十八元、較前市收價又回升二三元至四元之巨耳、後市尙圓喊高、故今天開市或須再度引起業內外客囤之競爭、市面再見升漲、亦未可料、然而實際上存米充塞、航運通暢如故也、</p>
<p>洋米接踵到埠、連日到者已迭誌前報、茲悉太古公司瓊州輪、前日（二十五日）傍晚抵滬、同暹邏運來洋米一萬零四百四十六包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、聞有大批越米在途來滬、法公司勞亞斯號輪約月底月初到滬、由西負裝來大量洋米、確數尙未悉、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米市雖到貨仍屬有限、但天雨滂沱、頗多水漬之貨、以是貨主明見洋米奔騰、無力扳持、惟謀脫手、而本鄉店胃、亦仍平淡、結果市價未有變化、僅呈平定之局、計開南港新鮮早晚稻一百四十一二元至一百四十元、特別一百四十五元、無錫原包宿粳一百三十二元、</p>
<p>糯米去路仍不振、僅些須飯擔零星去胃、故如香港白元難能與洋米並駕齊驅、祇略為帶緊而已、至於國糯則以來源中斷、及市貨亦稀、未聞做開、</p>
<h3>粉市重振　華北需要活動　日商收買甚殷</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨現洋粉市況、疲而復振、初以金龍粉由香港轉來不少、市面本無特殊興奮、嗣以華北需要活動、日商在市收買甚殷、兼有外匯凍結消息、引起踢皮球囤戶之垂青、金龍粉開盤即抬至三十二元二角及三角四角、收市略鬆、做開三十二元二角半、砲臺粉三十三元〇五分至三角半、雙鷹牌三十二元、鐘樓牌澳粉過磅三十三元五角、比前各升三五角不等、成交總計二萬餘包、市面形勢、仍在動盪不定中、</p>
<p>小麥　新小麥來源、近郊稍有二三百抵埠、均為解送日廠門市收去、售價仍為四十一元左右、華廠進胃四十七元、但無現貨可收、</p>
<h3>外匯市塲有變動　百物飛騰</h3>
<p>赤白冰糖　昨日糖市因美國凍結中日資金、進口貨匯票無法購結、致人心大佳、價乃扶搖直上、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白六月份人口初為九十七元半、而至九十九元、後市直達一百零一元、五月份入口九十七元九十八元半、後為一百元零零八角、升四元半至四元八角、四月份入口九十七元至一百元、升五元半、七月三十日打單初市亦平、為九十七元八角·八元半·九元半、而至一百元、旋出百元關、為零一元·二元·三元半、升六元、荷亦NT嘜七十八元至八十二元、升五元二角、KD嘜七十八元半·八十元·八十二元·八十四元、升六元半、普通荷棉白九十四元半、太古車白B嘜見新紀錄為一百二十二元至一百二十五元、後叫一百二十八元、升五元、DY嘜一百十二元、HX嘜九十六元半·七元半·九元而至一百元、升四元、HM嘜八十八元、H嘜車亦七十八元、升六元半、本一號冰一百三十元、晶明冰一百三十二元、升六元、</p>
<p>油餅雜糧　昨日油豆餅市況、因受金融流言波動、人心皆呈堅化、投機商亦趁勢活躍、故行情一致向榮、結果食油激漲三四元、黃豆昂半元有奇、豆餅升二角、計售開膠州生油六十件、價為一百四十五元、青島生油六十桶、價為二百零五元至二百零七元、又豆油四十桶、價二百零六元、大連豆油四十桶、價二百零五元至二百零八元、天津金元二百包、四十九元至四十九元半、膠州黃豆三百包、四十七元半四十八元、歸德黃豆一千五百包、價四十四元半至四十五元半、濟寗黃豆一百包、價四十五元八角、大有豆餅二千片、價十五冗七角半至十五元九角、甡記豆餅、二千片、十五元八九角、又七月下交十六元五角半至十六元七角、</p>
<p>火柴燭皂　昨市日用品一致飛漲、蓋以美國凍結遠東資金、各方人心頓趨緊張、賣方極力扒進、執貨者扳持價格、大都觀勢拋售、少數脫手、致價愈呈緊俏、如火柴買價、劇漲甚烈、市價較前猛升五十餘元、計美麗牌每箱七百七十元、鳳凰牌每箱七百六十元、肥皂亦趨微漲、固本皂每箱五十三元、白祥茂皂四十三元、黃祥茂皂四十元、洋燭漲風加厲、蓋各方納強盛、買價如白禮氏船牌每箱高至三十二元、</p>

<h3>英美凍結中日資金　法幣基礎益鞏固　各界勿信流言應求鎭靜　正當需要外匯仍予供給</h3>
<p>美國羅斯福總統、於昨日起宣布凍結日本資金、英國亦採平行行動、故金融界咸認美國此舉、無異與日本斷絕關係、而以最有效之經濟制裁方法、以反抗日本侵略、此舉中國絕對有利、以日本於侵華四年後、經濟已瀕於枯竭、甚感有無法支持之苦、今受此重大打擊、當更不堪設想、至美國同時凍結中國資金問題、據金融界表示、上海為遠東金融中心、但已為淪陷區、如僅凍結日本資金、則上海龐大數字之外匯、仍將陷入日方之手、故中日必須同時凍結、方能生效、故美政府循中國之請、乃同時採此一行動、且中國被凍結之外匯、如經政府核准、當仍作正當用途、惟辦法尙未宣布耳、</p>
<p>實施限制一律停付</p>
<p>自美政府宣布凍結資金後、本埠美商銀行即將緊急措施、對本埠日商正金·朝鮮·台灣·等各銀行及華商銀行存於美國銀行之外匯、實施限制、一律停止付給美匯、凡欲提取外匯之中日銀行、一律須照下列二項暫時辦法辦理、（一）中日銀行及中日商、提取外匯者、美商銀行祇付以紐約之匯票、此項匯票、須向紐約兌付、而紐約之兌現與否、則須由美國財政當局決定之、（二）中日銀行或商人如欲提取美金存款者、不付美金、而照市價結算、付以法幣、至於英商匯豐銀行·麥加利銀行·及有利銀行、對於美匯存款、亦已與美商銀行採取平行行　、凡屬中日二國存戶之外匯、均付以倫敦匯票、或照市價折算而付以法幣、蓋為防止凍結資金之逃避也、</p>
<p>日本商業慘重打擊</p>
<p>日本對美主要輸出物為絲類、每年共五萬日元、對　主要輸出物為棉織品、每年為四萬萬日元、兩共九萬萬日元、自英美輸入日本東四省及關東貨物、總值為日本全部輸入百分之五十、今後此項貿易勢將完全斷絕、</p>
<p>對於中國絕無影響</p>
<p>但有人深慮中國資金同時被凍結後、則中國此後與美國·英帝國·南美洲·蘇聯及荷印間之進出口貿易、有中斷之虞、金融界則認、美凍結中國資金、旣係徇中國之申請、則此舉完全為防止日本套匯、係正本清源之舉、且羅斯福總統在頒佈凍結令前、美財政部已發出各種執照、對夏威夷及菲列濱、與中國及日本間商業一旦中斷後、作各種預防措施、此外並以一特別執照授權予十四家著名銀行、處理中國任何部分（東四省除外）與美國·英帝國·南美洲·蘇聯·及荷印間之進出口貿易事宜、故深信美國此舉、與中國對外商業關係外、決不致發生影響、而受嚴重打擊者、則為日本一國而已、</p>
<p>餐匯供給採執照制</p>
<p>昨據政府銀行方面消息、英美政府此項所採取凍結中日資金之辦法、乃由中國平凖基金委員會美籍委員福克斯、來滬考察返港與其他委員商決後、向美國政府所建議者、而英國政府為表示與美合作起見、亦採取同一步驟、以為響應、查平凖委員會對上海外匯黑市、始張濤主張予以維持、而今後為保障中英美合法貿易計、對各業正當需要外匯、決予儘量供給、並採取「執照制度」、與英美商各銀行通力合作、凡請求供給外匯者、必須陳述理由、經核准後方得購買、否則一概予以拒絕、此舉對日商投機者極為不利、</p>
<p>幣信鞏固杜絕陰謀</p>
<p>關於英美凍結中日資金引起上海金融市塲波動、而中國整個金融、則依然穩定如恒、況凍結中國之資金、係應將委員長之請求、實行之後、足使中國法幣信用愈見鞏固、自由區域必須品之輸入、依然得申請照中交兩行掛牌之商業匯兌、而上海之正當商人如需要外匯、亦決予儘量供給、所以盼望各業力持鎭靜、無庸過分憂慮、切勿為市塲謠言所惑、蓋維護正當商人合法營業、為中國政府旣定之政策、此後之上海匯市、將持久穩定、使陰謀者無法套取外匯、投機者亦無法再施其故技、此種凍結措置、尤使中國幣制金融前途、大為樂觀、</p>
<h3>煤氣附加費　自下月起核減　附加費減去百分之九十　公司經營合理造福公眾</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處發表、查上海自來火公司請將煤氣臨時附加費由百分之二五〇減至百分之一六〇一案、業經本局公用事業委員會開會討論、並經轉呈董事會例會通過、准目本年八月一日起實施、并得在本年十月底以前、隨時重行考量、際茲物價高漲時期、該公司所以能核減附加費者、一部份由於提早修竣曲頸蒸溜器所致、此種措置、使大部份較廉之煤斤、成為炭化、於是製造煤氣之成本、為之減輕、更因運用此項煤斤之增加、使公司可資出售之熟煤數量、得以提增、藉裕收入、此外出售剩餘品之所得、亦因售價較昂而增益公司之收入也、</p>
<h3>廣東輪被扣貨物　係荷政府所有　日已查明託荷領交還原主　馬勒輪扣貨正在陸續御下</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨日（二十五日）午後日方招待新聞記者席上、日陸軍發言人秋山中佐之代表松田少佐聲稱、日當局已查悉從太古公司廣東號輪御下之貨物九百噸、並非重慶中政府之財產如前所懷疑者、但係荷蘭政府所有、故全部貨物、昨已託滬荷總領事鮑雪汶轉交原主、</p>
<p>因未檢查致起誤會</p>
<p>荷政府已承認貨物被扣、咎在荷方、因裝英輪運出前、未經日當局檢查也、此項貨物係棉布與紡織機、分裝七百三十九箱、共約九百噸、昨已無條件發還云、查廣東號係七月十日被扣、所載貨物被日當局移入堆棧檢查、該輪始於上星期六日駛出、</p>
<p>馬勒扣貨約六百噸</p>
<p>發言人又稱、英輪海達馬勒號所載貨物、昨已御岸、交此間英當局看管、該輪載有機件與棉布約五百至六百噸、運往仰光與回爾各答、</p>
<p>日方認係重慶所有</p>

<p>英大使館發表聲明</p>
<p>本埠英國大使館、昨日對於廣東號輪及馬勒號輪被日軍所扣一事、發表聲明稱、此間各報所發表關於廣東輪及馬勒輪所載貨物、因日當局之請求而御落之各項消息、其中亦有根據日海軍發言人之談話者、茲將事實公布如下、廣東號輪所載之紡織機器、係屬荷印當局所有、此次被迫御落、英大使館並未獲悉、荷政府有申明承認該項機器被扣之應負責任、因該項機器於載於英國商船前、並未受有日本當局檢查之故、惟此項申明、事實上並無必需、蓋係爭之貨物、旣經履行報關手續、自無複經檢查之必要、　日憲兵之反對、乃於係爭貨物經報關手續後、於裝載廣東號輪開始提出、廣東號輪之被扣及所載貨物之御落、係經荷印當局向日本當局完全解釋貨物所有權後而始發生也、關於馬勒號輪之事、日本憲兵於各項貨物履行報關手續及裝船完竣後、始反對該貨物運往香港·西貢·及加爾各答、該項貨物係託運至上開三處之華人、並非屬於重慶所有、且並無經日本當局檢查之必要、茲將係爭貨物已由船方暫御於公和祥碼頭、至有確定之決定時為止、</p>
<h3>法輪航期　不再公布　滬越航運不受影響</h3>
<p>頃據航業界消息、法國航務公司近因遠東形勢驟緊、因環境需要、對所屬各輪之航期、將暫守秘密、不再預先公布、惟滬越航運、則並不因局勢嚴重、而發生影響、聞該公司大達南號輪已定於明日（廿八日）由滬啟椗駛往西貢·小呂宋·等處、洛司號輪則約於本月底由越載運貨米來滬</p>
<h3>滬甬間航運　被日獨佔</h3>
<p>滬甬間航運、雖有華人方面擬組織公司、參加航行、但喧傳多時、迄未實現、目前開航滬甬間之客輪、仍為日方專有之鳴鳳丸一艘、該輪往來滬甬、並無定期、惟因噸位甚小、客貨不能多載、每次載客約百餘人、票價頗高、所載之貨、除彼軍用所需之糧食及藥品而外、不載其他商貨、搭客携带行李、亦以四十公斤為限、故與實際貨運、未嘗有利、</p>
<h3>大新酒家罷工</h3>
<p>南京路大新公司附設之大新酒家、本設有茶室　粵菜部職工數十人、近因待遇苛刻、並反對強抽小賬及顧客賞金、突於昨宣告怠工、現該項工潮、仍在僵持中、</p>
<h3>電車月季票　下月起加價　增高百分之五十</h3>
<p>公共租界英商上海電車公司、自本月十四日起實行增價以來、已將半月、對於月季票加價、其加價額較前增高為百分之寶玉十、計頭等成人月票每張三十二元、十六歲以下兒童每張十六元、若通用兩租界者成人每張四十八元、兒童每張二十四元、公司方面、現已開始發售、</p>
<h3>日航運新辦法　並無明白規定　日郵會社仍售赴日客票　其他兩公司則暫行停止</h3>
<p>日大使館聲稱不明幕後原因何在</p>
<p>字林報云、日大使館發言人昨（二十六日）在此間招待新聞記者時聲稱、關於經營上海往日本與華北航業之日方航運公司新條例及航期、上海方面不明究竟、故渠已加查問而述明之、現日本郵船會社仍售赴日船票、東亞海運會社則不然、大連汽船會社亦不售赴日船票、但赴青島之船票依然出　、上海日方各航業分公司皆依照國內總公司命令行事、至於實施此項新辦法之幕後原因何在、日大使館與海軍發言人俱不知之、　據聲、為結束中日戰事起見、航期因軍事需要、當然應加變更、日方召集上海日僑後備兵與航運新辦法兩事、毫無關係、</p>

<h3>豆米公會昨發表　民食存底充實　全市存米總達二百十餘萬包　足夠八月需用前途無虞匱乏</h3>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會第一百二十一期存米調查、自於上星期五開始調查以還、卒因連日大雨、進行不無困難、延期於昨日始吿完竣、茲據該曾報吿云、本期（上週四起至本週四止）各華洋堆棧存米共達一百二十七萬四千五百五十二包、比上期增加七萬四千七百五十五包、惟前昨兩日由國內外運抵之米糧、因尙在卸貨進棧、均未調查在內、</p>
<p>各棧存米較前倍增</p>
<p>本期內存米查資、係包括浦東·虹口、中區等、約達九十餘家華洋米棧、其中以羅斯福·怡和·太古·公和祥·順泰·隆茂公司·中國實業·浙江興業·中國·交通等銀行堆棧、爲數最爲可觀、平均每棧存米的達二萬包之譜、查昨年今日全市堆米棧房僅七十餘家、而米棧存底亦不過四五十萬包不等、現豆米公會已將調查所得、彙報兩租界當局、曁七米業團體備查、</p>
<p>全市存糧足敷八月</p>
<p>據悉上項存米僅屬各華洋堆棧、惟米號門售及進儲、居民預購儲積、暨各民食團體代爲訂購而已運滬者、均本調查在內、據確切估計、該項存糧、現已逾越八十萬包以上、故本市整個民食存底、刻已激增至二百十餘萬包之譜、目前本市每日食米去路仍爲一萬石左右、較前並未增多、蓋本市所有存糧、足够全市居民八個月餘之需要、矧國內外來源、仍蟬聯於途、民食前途、決無匱乏虞</p>
<p>有效措置嚴格執行</p>
<p>本市各米業團體前曾奉兩租界當局諭令、從速取締米市塲各種非法交易、（一）同業在塲買賣一律以現貨交易、不得買空賣空、（二）參與市塲交易者、嚴禁輾轉買賣、藉口抬價漁利、（三）一俟米糧成交、務須由買進賣出雙方出立成進出單、以憑核對、茲悉兩當局對於此項有效措置、決將繼續嚴格執行、凡米商在塲買賣務各恪遵、不得陽奉陰違、吾則決照旣訂定章嚴厲懲治、</p>

<h3>資金凍結以後　上海所呈反應　一切估計似均嫌過早</h3>
<p>美羅斯福總統已於昨晨頒令凍結日方在美資產，英政府亦立即接踵而起，凍結央帝國境內之日方資金，其結果已使世界商業之一大部份陷於停頓。美總統旣宣布凍結，立即發出各柿執照，以防夏威夷·菲列賓·日本與中國間之貿易阻斷，並予著名銀行十四家以特殊執照，許其資助在中國任何部份（東四省除外）與美洲各共和國。英屬地·蘇聯與何印間經營進出口業之商人。</p>
<p>本市商界預料將頒凍結令者，已非一日，昨旣實現，上海滙市頓起爭購美元之風，致使滙率轉緊，滙市投機者多頭約達美金三百萬元，空頭的美金二百萬元，觀此可知空頭吃緊，不得不竭力補進，而不間滙率如何。本市各銀行因已不能在紐的補進美匯，故已停止美元之現貨期貨交易，僅結淸多頭而不予空頭以資助。</p>
<p>視滙市爲轉移之烚赤黑市，頗少現貨交易，期貨成交則巨，而期現兩種價格，均較隔日收盤漲起，紗價亦更趨堅挺，因衆料今後難以輸入原棉也。截至昨日午後爲止，凍結辦法對於上海將適用何種特殊條例及米棉等進口商如何證明其要求爲合法兩點，尙米可知，但美方各銀行對商人與進口商之能證明其活動不與美國利益相悖者，將給予許可，當無疑義。</p>
<p>至於美當局對存款於美銀行者之個人需要，將予以何種稈度之考量，現亦未悉。目前若欲估計美英凍結令對遠東之遠大影響，及太平洋中行將發生之事態，亦嫌過早，然日本之經濟制度，因中日戰爭消費日增，業已重負纍纍，今後更將捉襟見肘，亟應懸崖勒馬，以免慘禍，則屬無可置辯者。</p>
<p>至於本市烚赤與美元市塲之投機活動，茲後自將斂跡，昨日證券市塲無交易，故不能確知上海商人對凍結令之態度將如何，但據分析家之意，上海游資今後旣失出路，料將再度湧入證劵市塲，故證劵市價明日諒將高漲。太平洋戰爭，似無一觸即發之虞，商界與投發份子，是吾亦抱此意，未可逆料，就其他市塲之情况斷之，似無預料美日將於短期內開戰者。　（微中）</p>

<h3>誰是你的摯友</h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>我可以斷定每一個小朋友，都有許多的朋友，在朋友中感情有親疏，其中一定有你最要好最親近的朋友，就是我所謂的摯友。小服友們的認爲摯友，是吾他時常送心愛的東西給你吃或玩。是吾你們志趣相同，例如你們兩人都喜歡拍球，因爲天天在一起拍球而成爲摯友。是吾你們常常吃喝遊玩，相處過熟，才成爲摯友。可是假使你老是不送還東西給他，他也不肯任意的和你來往；假使你因事因病的好幾天不和他拍球，那麼他會漸漸的和你疏遠起來；假使父母不給你錢由你同摯友吃喝，他也不會讓你常常吃白食。這種朋友，在平時果然談得很投機，一同吃喝遊玩，相處得很快樂，如果你們一旦意見不合，發生利害衝突，就各走各的路，有的因此格外仇恨起來；或者你有了極大的困難不能解決，他也不來管你的事了，這種人是你的摯友嗎？</p>
<p>那麼誰是你的摯友呢？也許是你認爲最討厭的人吧！他時常指點你的錯處，規勸你改進，關心你的學業和行爲，你有了過失，他替你難過，你有了困難，他幫助你解決。在平日，他不一定跟你隨意和你的朋友們遊蕩，但是他終是處處留意你的行動，希望你力求向上。</p>
<p>小朋友們年齡小，經歷少，認不淸誰是你的摯友，以爲時常和你一起玩的，或者曾經幫你一次忙的，不管他的品行如何不端，學業如何低劣，你就認爲他是摯友，相處過久，你的行爲上也有了汚點，我親眼看見許多兒童，因交友不愼，學會了粗俗的話，做出下流的事，什麼結黨打架啊，眞是不勝枚舉，小朋友們，你們仔細想一想，認識不淸，交友不愼，那是多麽危險啊！</p>
<p>最後忠吿小朋友們！摯友並不是吃喝朋友，遊玩朋友，志趣上朋友，乃是能規勸你的，希望你向上的，才是你眞正的摯友。志趣上的朋友，只要他行爲正當，而且也是一個優良的兒童，那你多交幾個也不妨，可是誰是你的摯友，你非得認淸楚不可，認淸楚後，你要時常和他親近，接受他的好意。</p>
<h3>晏平仲的機警</h3>
<p>— 秤</p>
<p>在春秋時候，齊國有一個大夫，姓晏，名平仲，身長不過三尺，服飾又很樸實，但才能却是勝人。</p>
<p>一日，齊君派遣他出使到楚國去修好邦交，照例，這國的大臣，被派到彼國去修好邦交，招待使臣的禮貌，應當何等隆重，然而此番，楚王素知他是個矮子，便有意和他開玩笑，王宮明明有着大門楚王却特地在大門旁邊新闢一個小門，等到晏平仲到宮門口後，引導的人特地領他走小門，他這意思無非是嘲笑晏平仲是個矮子，用不着大門裏進出，他就對引導的人說道：「這是個狗洞啊！我是到楚國去，又不是進狗國的皇宮，何必走這狗洞呀！」引導的人，不防他這一頓痛駡，只得報吿楚王，重開大門請他進去。</p>
<p>這事楚王知道了，當然十分羞恥，一會兒平仲走進去，楚王懶洋洋和平仲行了個相見禮後，劈頭一句就是說一雖道貴國沒有人了嗎」？晏平仲不慌不忙的回答說：「齊京臨淄地方，在街上正是輪磨輪而肩碰肩，若每人一揮汗立可成雨，怎麽說沒人呢？」楚王便說「那麼爲何要派你這樣的人到我們堂堂楚國來呢？」平仲便答道「我國派使者是有定則的，大凡派到大國去，總是派遣偉大人物！到小國去，那就派遣像我這樣的人來了！」楚王本想譏笑他，不料反而被他所笑，他也只得忍受於心中。</p>
<p>後來楚王謂平仲宴會，忽然階下牽過一個犯人，楚王故意問着左右說：「這人犯了什麼罪？」左右就回答說：「這是一個齊國人，是犯了盜案」於是，楚王就嘲笑地望着晏平仲道：「呀！難道齊國人慣做强盜的嗎？」晏平仲就侃侃地說：「同是一　橘樹在淮南的時候是生橘子，一移到淮北，所生出來的便成枳子，剛才一個罪犯在敝國的時候不做强盜，偏偏一到了貴國，就幹出了打家刦舍的勾當來，說起來，還要謝謝貴國的好敎化呢？」</p>
<p>楚王聽了十分羞恥，便用上賓的禮制來和他周旋！</p>
<h3>吃凉粉</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>正是一個暑天的下午，天氣熱得像發燒似的。小弟弟囔着要吃冰棒。媽媽說：「一棒冰太冷了，你去買些洋菜來，我們做凉粉嘗嘗，好嗎？」</p>
<p>弟弟高興地說：「好的。」說罷，便去買洋菜了。</p>
<p>他們動手做凉粉：先拿洋菜一兩，浸在冷水裏洗凈。然後用白糖四　，溶化兩碗的沸水中，　在鍋子裏煮。等到糖已溶，便加入洋菜攪拌，直到洋菜溶化，和水混成膠狀爲止。再濾去糖和洋菜中不潔的東西，等它半冷，可加入果子露三四匙，繼續使它冷却。過一小時，便凝結成透明的膏狀的凉湯了。</p>
<p>於是，他們便分嘗着。弟弟一壁吃，一壁說：「這凉粉，又甜又香又淸凉，眞是好吃！」</p>
<p>媽媽說：「凉粉固然好吃，但是不要忘了做成凉粉的原料是什麽？」弟弟說：「還不是我買來好洋菜。」</p>
<p>媽媽說：「是的。那末，洋菜是怎樣做成的呢？」「……」</p>
<p>媽媽又說：「洋菜是一種國產的食物，是用海藻裏面的一種紅色的，叫做石花菜的植物，把它煮成溶液，過濾脫色，蒸發濃稠，等它冷後凝凍，切成細條，再使他乾燥，便成市上所賣的洋菜了。洋菜不僅可以做凉粉，也是我們常吃的菜餚呀！」</p>
<h3>打針</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>當阿慧的爸爸看到了報紙上，這一段消息：「本市霍亂有蔓延之虞，租界貧民區內曾發生時疫，死亡多人，故每一居民務必注射防疫針，注射後可在四個月內不染時疫，此後數星期內，霍亂有擴大蔓延之勢，以故未經注射防疫針者，須立即注射。「以後，他老人家便去請了一位熟識的醫生來，預備替合家的每一個人注射防疫針。</p>
<p>「爸爸，爲什麽霍亂能殺死人呢？」阿慧對於這「霍亂」二個陌生字，又發生了這個問題。</p>
<p>「霍亂是一種夏天特別容易生的疾病，而且能傳染的，所以這種時疫病很是可怕。要是生了這病，便要吐瀉發熱，不到一二日，更是凶險，不久那病人便死去了。道因爲霍亂病是有一種霍亂病菌，從蒼蠅和其他不淸潔和沒有燒熟的小菜上傳到我們嘴裏，而病菌是很細小而有生命的，它們一入身體，就侵入血液中，產生一種毒汁，把血液破壞。這個人就不能活着過日子了。」</p>
<p>「那麼爲甚麼要打針呢？」阿慧覺得打針很是件苦痛的事像年去打了針也不見得什麼好處，所以他把這個問題提出來，問着他爸爸。</p>
<p>「打了防疫針，就可預防霍亂傷寒等時疫病的發生，也就是不再生這種危險的病了。</p>
<p>但他爸爸所回答的還不是他所問的本意，所以再問了一下：「爲什麼防疫針能預防時疫病呢？」</p>
<p>「你可知道防疫針中像膠水一般的東西，它是怎樣做成的呢？」他爸爸反倒問起他來了。阿慧搖了搖頭，表示不知道。</p>
<p>他爸爸便接下去說：「這東西叫做疫菌，它的種類很多，那一種疫菌能預防那一種疾病，如要預防霍亂，那只需打霍亂預防疫菌。像預防天花要種牛痘，牛痘也是一種疫菌。這種疫菌的製造，費了很多醫學家的心學去研究，才能成功。先把霍亂病菌種在强健的動物身體上，像牛馬兎等，病菌一接觸到動物身上，當然也照樣的侵入動物血中，可是動物的抵抗力來得强健，不怕病菌發出的毒汁，反而去撲滅它們，便能减低毒力的程度，或者把病菌殺死，於是醫生把它取下來，經過了一番消毒，精製成各種疫菌把這種疫菌注射到人體裏，可以增加人體的殺菌能力，便不怕再生這種疾病了。」</p>
<p>有一天，打防疫針的醫生果然來了。阿慧情情願願的，首先讓醫生把長長的的尖針刺入他的嫩皮膚裏去，只覺得有一些脹痛而已，這因爲他已明白了打防疫針到底有些什麽功效，不像去年那樣了。這樣一個個輪着打針，最後輪到老媽子，那知伊響着喉嚨說着：」這種霍亂吐瀉病，我是生過了，今年不用再打了。」伊堅持着不肯打，結果只打進了小半管的疫菌。這又引起了阿慧的驚奇。「這是什麽道理？」他問着那位醫生。</p>
<p>「因爲伊生過霍亂病，身體裏便產生了抵抗霍亂病菌的一種抗毒素，能把這些病菌殺死，並且這種抗毒素還有多餘，便留在伊的身體裏，所以可以少注射一些疫菌，如第二次的身體內再發現這種病菌時，還留剩的抗毒素立即可以將它們殺死，而不會再生這種病了。」</p>

<p>— 自强小學張希賢</p>
<p>前大，我在申報上的敎育新聞欄裹，見載着一段兒實圖書館開幕的消息；那時我非常的欣喜，並且預備和我大哥一同到館去參觀一番。昨天飯後，我和大哥從普陀路出發，折向戈登路，到大華路的該圖書館去。</p>
<p>走了半個多鐘頭，才走到圖書館，門口有許多的人，如潮湧般的進去，我們也雜在人叢中擠了進去。</p>
<p>該館的設備，的確是非常完美，書橱靠着牆壁，橱內的書，排列得整齊非常，底下是一排凳，兒童們全坐着看書，臉上現着快樂的微笑，秩序却也很好。壁上掛着兩幅地圖，一幅是中華現勢大地圖，一幅是世界現勢大地圖。照像掛在牆上的很多，有吉安周母陳太夫人遺像，和董事會董事的照；偉人的照片有孫中由，岳飛，孔子。華盛頓，安迪生，林肯等，我們對他們肅然起敬。該館的職員先生，都很和藹可親，笑容可掬。我選了幾本書看看，如哥倫布，貝登堡的傳記，以及作文的修辭等，內容果然很好，很適合我們兒童的心理。續了一回，我抬頭見鐘上的長短針，正指在六和十二的中間，就隨着人們一同出來，和大哥回家。</p>
<h3>在人多的地方為什麼很易頭痛？（下）</h3>
<p>— 阿毛</p>
<p>有人以爲因爲我們呼出來的是碳酸氣，而需要的是養氣，當許多人聚在一間屋子裏的時候，碳酸氣的量就慢慢增多，氧氣不够，就要使人頭痛，這說法也是不對的。碳酸氣本身沒有毒，人不至因吸碳酸氣而生病。但是按照經騐，在人多的地方，若是碳酸氣的量增加，室內的溫度一定也跟着增加，這樣就有損我們的健康。所以公共塲所的換氣機，仍舊用碳酸氣作標準，來調整空氣的。</p>
<p>總之一句話，在人多的地方，所以很易頭痛的緣故，是因爲我們周圍的溫度太高，使我們身上多餘的熱不能再放出來。好像夏天在大太陽下走路會發痧，冬天坐在關着窗子並且生了很熱的火爐的房間裏，我們會頭痛一樣的道理。（酬移「續者助學金」）</p>

<h3>傳吳素秋將躍登銀幕</h3>
<p>— 貝士</p>
<p>吳索秋是一位皮黃劇壇的驕子，因爲容貌美麗，叉善交際，去年在更新舞台初次演出，立刻轟動一時，傾倒不少顧曲周郎，當時國聯影片公司曾計劃請她拍一部「平劇的電影」，後來因條件不合就作罷了。</p>
<p>民華金信民，平時非常愛好皮黃劇，他常感到：如果加以合理的改善，皮黃劇的前途不難發揚而廣大的。費穆也與金信民具有一般的觀念。因此，不久前攝竣的「古中國之歌」，就都利用電影手法加以攝製的。現在，美成廠規定八月一日起，由金星以一月半時間拍一部戲後，民華也以一月半的時間拍一部戲，如此，在時間與空間方面都不衝突了。民華當局，接受到這一個建議後，在會商下，如果拍一部新編起來的劇本，無論如何來不及的，於是，又擬計劃拍一部如「古中國之歌」的「平劇的電影」了。於是想到了去年轟動一時的吳素秋。</p>
<p>不過，問題很多，如果單獨請她從北平到上海來拍戲，非但沒有配角，而且依照梨園的習慣，一切旅途用費以及來滬後膳宿費等，均由公司當局負責，這未免太不上算了。因此，最好的希望，吳素秋能够到上海來演劇，可乘便接洽，負担方面也就减輕不少呢。</p>

<p>— 聿修</p>
<p>今年光裕社書塲的業務，有着很顯著的發展，東方書塲的中塲，開幕還沒有多久，現在新型的滄洲書塲，又接踵而起了。</p>
<p>滄洲書塲附設在滄洲飯店裏面，地方幽靜，交通又便，無疑是一個最合於理想的書塲；現在「靑龍檔」早，日，夜三塲，同時以簇新的姿態和堅强的陣容，來一新聽客的耳目。筆者就在某一天的日塲，去觀光了一回。</p>
<p>書塲佈置在一個南向的長方形的客廳裏，座位是一律的白帆布椅子，佔地不多，而聽客坐下來極爲舒服。面對着一方碧綠的草坪，而繞以一道寬大的走廊，長窗洞開，凉風習習，空氣淸爽，光綫調和，所以多坐一會，也不覺得氣悶或是疲倦。</p>
<p>日塲完全是彈詞，想來是因爲地位的關係，女聽客特別多，所以沒有一檔是評話吧。頭檔朱趙啼笑姻緣，不用介紹，大家早已在電台和書塲上聽的滾瓜爛熟，知道得很是淸楚了。二檔的蔣月泉，成名未久，所以口齒唱作，還欠老到，定要同周玉泉拚做，纔能收珠聯璧合之妙，現在獨做，就不免耍打一個老大的折扣了。三檔薛筱卿，自和沈儉安拆檔後，改做上手，說白表情，終脫不掉「揷邊花」（下手）的本色；可注意的倒是他現在的下手龐學卿。龐師事薛筱卿，而有着一條天賦的好喉嚨，牙淸齒爽，唱起來一波三折，大有靑出於藍的樣子。前幾年和倪萍倩拚檔，「倪龐檔」被稱爲後起之秀，而名噪一時。拆檔以後，所至潦倒，無復當年盛况，到現在差不多沒有人再提起他的名字了。藝人　零，往往如此，可爲一嘆！</p>
<p>綜觀滄洲書塲的佈置和陣容，多經過了一番仔細的推敲，當得起精審二偭字的推許，所以開幕以來，成績美滿，聽客始終未落，這不能不說是上海游藝界中一件可喜的事情。</p>

<h3>Parallel Measures Taken by the United States and Britain: Announcement of Freezing Japanese Funds as an Initial Retaliation for Japan's Invasion of Vietnam; Chinese Funds Also Frozen Upon Request</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) – Last night, President Roosevelt issued an executive order to freeze all Japanese funds in the United States, effective Saturday. Officials believe this is an initial economic strike in retaliation for Japan's aggression in Vietnam. At the same time, President Roosevelt, at the special request of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, froze all Chinese funds in the United States as a "continuation of the government's policy of protecting China." This announcement of the freeze was issued simultaneously in Washington and Hyde Park. President Roosevelt is currently spending his weekend in Hyde Park. The Treasury Department immediately issued general notices, the first of which aims to avoid the interruption of commerce between Hawaii and the Philippines and between China and Japan. One of the general notices was given to four banks in Hawaii and six banks in the Philippines. Another notice authorizes any Chinese or Japanese merchants in the Philippines to engage in normal commercial transactions in the Philippines. Another special notice grants fourteen major banks the right to conduct business within China, authorizing these banks to provide financial assistance for import and export trade between any part of China (excluding Manchuria) and the United States, Latin America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. Officials said that China is also included in the freezing order to avoid the misuse of any Japanese-controlled funds during the war and to counteract any Chinese currency issued by Japanese-controlled governments. Well-informed circles expect that Japanese businesses in Latin America will soon be added to President Roosevelt's blacklist. Although this freezing order is almost equivalent to an embargo, it is understood that a general embargo, or one that only includes gasoline and similar items, may be implemented soon. The fourteen banks are Chase Bank, Citibank, Allied Bank, American Express Bank, Tong Ji Long, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Old Sassoon &amp; Sons, New Sassoon &amp; Sons and Bank, Mercantile Bank, Netherlands Bank, Moscow National Bank, and Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (United Press) – The U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, presumably carrying President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese funds. In the afternoon, Grew also visited the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) – President Roosevelt will proceed cautiously when implementing the order to freeze Japanese funds and will give considerable consideration to the Japanese, it is said. In fact, officials here are implying that Japan is being put to the test. If Japan can maintain the status quo in the Pacific, it will receive reasonable treatment, it is said.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) – Officials here declared yesterday that the freezing order applies to all private funds owned by Japanese individuals, organizations, and companies.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) – The Treasury Department last night extended the rights under the general notice issued under President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese funds to Hong Kong, "considering Hong Kong as part of China."</p>
<p>London, 26th (United Press) – The British Foreign Office announced this morning that all Japanese assets in the British Empire would be frozen, effective this morning. The Foreign Office stated that all treasuries of the British Empire governments have been prohibited from engaging in transactions involving Japanese gold bullion and securities.</p>
<p>London, 26th (United Press) – Due to Japan's actions in French Indochina, all British colonies have agreed to fully participate in the joint retaliatory measures against Japan by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. It is expected here that the government will soon announce that the entire British Empire and the United States are united in taking economic and commercial sanctions against Japan. The freezing of Japanese funds by the United States and the British Empire, along with the previously reported broad consultation system on trade with Japan, is virtually a complete embargo on commerce with Japan. Until now, Japan has almost completely obtained regular imports from the British Empire, which are expected to cease in the future. This joint sanction will deal a fatal blow to Japan's main exports, including its annual export of 500 million yuan of raw silk, most of which is sold to the United States, and 400 million yuan of marked goods to China and Manchuria, with the British Empire being the main market.</p>
<p>U.S. Forces in Hawaii and the Philippines Have Taken Precautionary Measures</p>
<p>New York, 26th (United Press) – The United States, Britain, and the British Empire jointly froze Japanese funds in those countries last night and this morning as a retaliation against Japan, thereby further straining relations in the Pacific. This decisive action is a retaliation against Japan's establishment of air and naval bases in southern Vietnam. Although this severe economic action is not expected to trigger an armed conflict between the British-American bloc and Japan, qualified observers believe that this concerted action is the most serious blow Japan has suffered since it began ravaging China in 1932.</p>
<p>San Francisco, 26th (Reuters) – Forty-five Japanese ships, originally intended to sail to the United States, suddenly left the Pacific coast after Undersecretary of State Welles issued a statement condemning Japan as an aggressor. They have not responded to radio communications to date. The Tatsuta Maru was discovered a few miles from the Golden Gate, but its current whereabouts are unknown. It is believed that the ship is either sailing to Mexico or waiting for refueling in the ocean, as a Japanese oil tanker sailed back to Japan from here on Thursday night. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) still announces that the Tatsuta Maru is scheduled to arrive here at 8:00 AM on Saturday. At the same time, two Japanese freighters, originally intended to sail from Yokohama to the United States, have been canceled. Japanese ships in the United States are now rushing to load cargo, hoping to leave as soon as possible. Capitals of the United States, Britain, and France believe that this order to freeze funds is only the beginning of a series of coordinated strikes aimed at crippling the Japanese economy. A complete embargo on exports to Japan by the British Empire and the United States, as well as a boycott of Japanese ships, is gradually becoming apparent. The United States has also ordered the freezing of Chinese funds in the United States, but this measure was specifically implemented at the request of General Chiang Kai-shek to prevent Japanese in the occupied areas of China from transferring their funds to Chinese accounts. At the same time, the United States has ordered all U.S. troops stationed in Hawaii to immediately adopt a state of training and precautionary measures in preparation for any retaliatory actions planned by Japan, which greatly threatens U.S. territories in the Pacific. Troops on the Hawaiian Islands have immediately deployed to multiple locations on the islands and installed anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese Privy Council will convene an extraordinary meeting next Monday to discuss "important and urgent matters." Japanese officials remain silent on the freezing order, awaiting notification from the countries concerned, while simultaneously taking the opportunity to shift the focus of attention to the Far East situation and announce that Japan and France have concluded an agreement for joint defense of Vietnam. This matter was already known to the world a few days ago. This agreement involves Japan's entry into naval and air bases in southern Vietnam, thereby completely controlling Vietnam, as northern Vietnam is already under Japanese protection.</p>
<p>Hyde Park, 26th (United Press Urgent) – President Roosevelt today ordered the incorporation of the Philippine land and sea forces into the U.S. military to respond to emergency situations.</p>
<p>If Japan Invades the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, the United States Will Likely Intervene Militarily</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) – A United Press reporter learned yesterday from diplomatic circles that if Japan wants to occupy French Indochina without conflicting with other interested powers, it cannot do so safely. The so-called interested powers refer to Britain and the United States. Regarding the issue of economic retaliation against Japan, diplomatic circles stated that as soon as officials learn that Japan has formally begun occupying Vietnam, economic retaliation will be implemented immediately. On the other hand, some hope that this economic retaliation can be implemented within this week, while others firmly believe that the United States will eventually create a dangerous situation in the world. Roosevelt also stated that the public believes that the United States should act quickly in this crisis, adding that, unfortunately, the American people do not yet fully understand the danger of the situation. Roosevelt pointed out that the American people's lack of understanding of the Far East crisis is far greater than that of the Western Front. The President declined to discuss what actions would be taken today but said that he was confident that Washington would take action against the situation today. Observers have no doubt that the government will implement a freeze on Japanese funds, and it seems very clear that President Roosevelt is determined to proceed cautiously. The freezing of funds seems to be the first step in a series of countermeasures.</p>
<p>Britain Is Fully Supporting the United States, Washington Expresses Great Welcome</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (Reuters) – While negotiations are being conducted under the threat of Japanese naval guns aimed at Saigon, arrangements for U.S. action are quietly being made here. The news from London that Britain is willing to fully support the United States is welcomed here. Generally, it is believed that a new U.S. policy is being planned, and this policy will certainly not be welcomed by Japan. It is felt that if the U.S. policy toward Japan does not change, President Roosevelt would never publicly explain the reasons why he allowed U.S. oil to be shipped to Japan over the past two years. The remarks made yesterday by Undersecretary of State Welles regarding the interests of U.S. national defense can be seen as the prelude to a major upheaval in the Pacific if Japan does not change course. American newspapers today continue to unanimously demand strong action. The Washington Post, in reading Welles' warning, pointed to it as a prelude to U.S. action. Japan, like Hitler, will continue its aggression without end. The United States cannot sit idly by and watch it occupy Vietnam without protest. It is now time to implement economic and financial sanctions against Japan, it said. The Baltimore Sun stated that the danger faced by Britain in Singapore is also the danger faced by the United States. The United States must resist Japan and prepare for any necessary actions, it said. The New York Times stated that the appearance of Japanese warships off the coast of Vietnam should be a sign that U.S. policy must change because Japan has engaged in new aggression that endangers U.S. interests, and the United States no longer has reason to delay its effective sanctions, it said. It is widely believed that various U.S. government departments are now discussing the possible actions mentioned above, namely: (1) banning oil shipments, (2) suspending gold purchases, (3) freezing Japanese assets in the United States, (4) expelling Japanese consular personnel, and (5) detaining Japanese ships in the United States. Some or all of the above actions will be implemented once Japan begins to enter Vietnam. Freezing Japanese funds or taking further strong measures, such as a complete embargo on all oil to Japan, will be accompanied by the same and parallel measures taken by Britain and its territories, such as Australia. Diplomatic circles believe that the motive for this measure is to warn Tokyo not to further invade the Dutch East Indies by force. U.S. lawmakers are divided on the question of whether the United States should take military action against Japan or only explore economic retaliation. A senior senator who is a member of a foreign affairs committee stated that unless Japan invades the Philippines, the United States is unlikely to use force against Japan. He said that the United States does not have a good base in the Dutch East Indies, and the strength of British and Indian forces seems insufficient. However, another senator believes that if Japan invades the Dutch East Indies, the United States will likely intervene militarily. The U.S. Army and Navy already have a genuine understanding of the Far East situation and have complete confidence in defeating Japan. He also said, "If Japan occupies the Dutch East Indies, the United States will find it economically and strategically intolerable." He also stated that military estimates indicate that if the United States obtains an air base in Vladivostok, 250 aircraft could bomb all major Japanese cities, which have never experienced air raids and are therefore practically "completely undefended" in terms of air defense. He also pointed out that from an economic point of view, the United States is almost entirely dependent on the Dutch East Indies for its production of tungsten and rubber. From a strategic point of view, Japan's occupation of the Dutch East Indies would give it a superior position to invade the Philippines. If the United States is unwilling to give up its interests in the Philippines, Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies would be intolerable.</p>
<p>Hyde Park, 26th (United Press) – President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the United States will take the first step today to prevent Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East. The President stated that Japan's actions in Vietnam have reminded the United States of the urgency of the international situation it faces. Therefore, the first step will be an executive order freezing Japanese funds in the United States. This step is the same as freezing the funds of Germany, Italy, and the Axis aggressor nations in Europe. Roosevelt also stated that the events in the Far East, namely Japan's deployment of troops to Vietnam, where the Straits Colonies and the supply lines for Great Britain are threatened, have made the American public feel the full severity of the</p>
<p>Tokyo Announced Retaliation Yesterday: Freezing U.S. and British Assets</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) – Japan has frozen U.S. and British assets in Japan today in retaliation. The Ministry of Finance announced that transactions involving the people of the United States and the Philippines will require special permits.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) – Finance Minister Ogura made a statement this afternoon, saying that the U.S. freezing of Japanese assets will not have much impact, and assured the country that the government had anticipated this U.S. action and has made full preparations. Japan's remaining assets in the United States are few, and trade between Japan and the United States has recently decreased due to the tightening of U.S. export restrictions. Therefore, the economic impact of this U.S. move on Japan will be relatively small. The Japanese government will take appropriate steps as needed, he said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) – Semi-official Japanese sources said that President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese assets is intended to prevent Japan from building an East Asian order because the order was issued on the eve of the conclusion of the Japan-France agreement to jointly defend Vietnam. Because the issuance of the freezing order contains a political plot against Japan, the scope and intensity of its implementation are difficult to predict. However, this order will not only affect the Japanese assets that are directly frozen but will also affect Japan's commercial transactions with the United States, Latin American countries, and the British Empire, all of which have taken parallel actions with the United States against Japan to date. According to observers, Japan has long been prepared, saying that the Japanese government has taken all possible countermeasures in advance against the widespread rumors of U.S. economic pressure on Japan, especially after the U.S. President ordered the freezing of German and Italian assets in the United States on June 14 this year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Halt Sailings to the United States</h3>
<p>San Francisco, 26th (Reuters) – Forty-five Japanese ships, originally intended to sail to the United States, suddenly left the Pacific coast after Undersecretary of State Welles issued a statement condemning Japan as an aggressor. They have not responded to radio communications to date. The Tatsuta Maru was discovered a few miles from the Golden Gate, but its current whereabouts are unknown. It is believed that this ship is either sailing to Mexico or waiting for refueling in the ocean, as a Japanese oil tanker sailed back to Japan from here on Thursday night. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) still announces that the Tatsuta Maru is scheduled to arrive here at 8:00 AM on Saturday. At the same time, two Japanese freighters, originally intended to sail from Yokohama to the United States, have been canceled. Japanese ships in the United States are now rushing to load cargo, hoping to leave as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>I. Freezing Funds and the Chinese Economy</h3>
<p>The news that President Roosevelt announced the freezing of all Chinese and Japanese funds in the United States, and that the British and Canadian governments announced the freezing of all Japanese funds within the British Empire, came like a bolt from the blue. The people of Shanghai were undoubtedly greatly shocked and lived in constant fear. What the general public fears most is that prices will tend to rise sharply, and that life will inevitably suffer the most brutal oppression! This is understandable for those who are easily frightened, but this is a unique phenomenon in Shanghai that should not be ignored. Why do we say this? Please let us explain.</p>
<p>In the past few dozen hours, hearsay has been full of the poison of terror, which is the ghostly trick of speculators. The enlightened have long seen through it, but the common people, because they have not seen correct discussions, are often fooled by them and easily fall into their trap. In the past, whenever there were major reforms, there were always similar phenomena. Those whose economic foundation is built on speculation have no way to correct it. Who knew that today's freezing of funds is not only harmless to people's livelihood, but also the most effective countermeasure to save people's livelihood? At this time of helplessness, it is actually the most commendable facility in our country's history and should be welcomed and supported by the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the foreign exchange market in Shanghai. Because the supply of U.S. dollars cannot be as free as in the past, the entire foreign exchange market seems to be affected by its constraints and fall into a state of stagnation. On the surface, this statement seems reasonable. But judging from reality, it is very wrong. Although the United States does not freely supply unlimited U.S. dollars to China and Japan, it must continue to supply other democratic countries or democratic regions. Therefore, speculators in China and Japan can still engage in indirect foreign exchange transactions with speculators in other democratic countries and realize their market arbitrage. In addition to British and American foreign exchange, other foreign exchanges such as Hong Kong dollars, Philippine pesos, Vietnamese dongs, and Japanese gold can still be traded without restrictions, so British and American foreign exchange can still be arbitraged. Moreover, the United States has designated fourteen banks as markets for specially approved U.S. dollar transactions to supply U.S. dollars for legitimate commercial needs, which shows that there is no danger of interrupting the supply of U.S. dollars. From this, it can be seen that the foreign exchange market in Shanghai will never be adversely affected. Due to arbitrage, there is fear that the control of U.S. dollars cannot be as strict as expected, which is the crux of the special international market. But what can be asserted is that foreign exchange speculation will never be as reckless as in the past, and the purchase and sale of foreign exchange must also go through considerable procedures, so the wind of speculation can be slightly curbed, which is the great function of freezing funds.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's discuss the issues of prices in Shanghai. On the surface, because the supply of U.S. dollars is no longer free, we can no longer freely use U.S. dollars to purchase application items, so they will tend to rise. Considering the facts, the U.S. government must still supply U.S. dollars for legitimate commerce, as mentioned earlier, so this concern should be dispelled. Moreover, due to the aforementioned foreign exchange arbitrage relationship, merchants can freely use the currencies of various countries, which is not much different from the past, so prices should not rise sharply. Assuming that the worst environment occurs in Shanghai and all commercial relations with the United States are severed, prices in Shanghai should not rise either, because in addition to gasoline, kerosene, and a few industrial products, all daily necessities can be shipped from other sources to meet the market demand. Moreover, the daily necessities needed by the general public can be supplied domestically, so their living needs will not be affected by foreign exchange. Taking rice as an example, the price seems to be rising due to Japan's southward advance, but it is not known that this freezing of funds has dealt the greatest blow to Japanese gold, and its currency value will undoubtedly plummet. On the contrary, because our legal currency is subject to the control and use restrictions of U.S. dollars, it can increase in value. Therefore, there is hope for lower rice prices, and there is no reason for them to rise sharply, which is another great contribution of freezing funds.</p>
<p>In short, this freezing of funds has hundreds of advantages and no disadvantages for our country. The public should remain calm and wait and see what happens, while speculators should urgently change their policies and work together to transform the national economic foundation. If there are those who want to take this opportunity to manipulate prices to seek profits, they will undoubtedly receive a serious lesson.</p>
<h3>II. The Retaliation of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Just as Japan was striding high and announcing the establishment of an agreement between France and Japan to jointly defend Vietnam, the governments of Britain and the United States simultaneously announced the freezing of Japanese funds in Britain, the United States, and all territories of the British Empire. Although Chinese funds are also included in the freezing, this is at the special request of the Chinese government, the purpose of which is only to help China stop Japan from using the foreign exchange owned by merchants and residents in the occupied areas. Therefore, in terms of the essence of this move by Britain and the United States, it is a 100% retaliation for Japan's decisive invasion of Vietnam.</p>
<p>According to reports from Washington, freezing funds is only one aspect of the many sanctions against Japan. Other measures, such as a complete embargo and boycotting Japanese ships, have long been under consideration by the U.S. authorities. In the future, as long as Japan takes further action, all kinds of economic weapons will inevitably be used one by one, until either an armed conflict occurs between the two sides or Japan retreats in the face of difficulties. Judging only from the current situation, this method of freezing funds, although it cannot be said to have completely controlled the economic lifeline of Japan, can at least be imagined that Japan will encounter extremely significant blows in terms of economics and even national defense. Because Japan has relied on foreign trade to maintain its domestic economy since it invaded China more than four years ago, especially trade with the United States and British territories in the Far East, the former with raw silk as the main product and the latter with cotton textiles as the main product. In the future, all financial transactions must be subject to the restriction of the permit system, and the British and American governments will naturally be able to use it to restrict the import of Japanese goods at any time, thereby trapping Japan's export industry in a difficult situation. This is the first inevitable blow. Secondly, some important resources on which Japan relies for war or survival, such as gasoline for war equipment in the United States and cotton and wool in Australia, must be paid for in U.S. dollars and British pounds. In the future, since funds have been frozen, under the manipulation of permits, they will naturally be greatly restricted, gradually trapping Japan in a situation where it cannot continue to fight or maintain its basic industries. This is the second inevitable blow.</p>
<p>Not only that, in addition to announcing the freezing order yesterday, the U.S. government also announced a "state of alert" by the military authorities in Hawaii. If we combine this with the words of Secretary of the Navy Knox yesterday, "The U.S. Navy is ready to be completed," it can be seen that the actions of the Washington authorities not only do not have the slightest appeasement attempt toward Japan, as has been rumored recently, but instead prove that President Roosevelt's consistent anti-aggression policy is becoming more and more resolute and clear. In addition to Britain's active strengthening of its military forces in Singapore and Malaya and Burma over the years, the Dutch East Indies authorities' unwavering rejection of Japan's harsh demands in the past, China's clear announcement that it will launch a counterattack this fall, and the common hatred of Australia, the Philippines, and New Zealand, it is not difficult to expect that if Japan does not know how to advance or retreat and continues to act rashly, then the Far East united front of China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, or even China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands and five countries, will definitely progress from the level of mutual understanding to the stage of concrete action.</p>
<p>Examining the significance of Japan's decisive further oppression of Vietnam is nothing more than a "reluctant second best" method of Konoe, that is, a thieving chicken policy in which the Japanese hope for "small cost and large harvest" as Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi said, but it was unexpected that this method of avoiding the important and taking the light would still incur a major retaliation from Britain and the United States. Therefore, the evolution of the Far East situation in the future will depend on Japan's movements. If Tokyo really has the determination and courage to compete with Britain and the United States, then the first step will naturally be to implement retaliation, freeze British and American funds in Japan and its sphere of influence, and at the same time brazenly occupy the entire territory of Vietnam in preparation for the next phase of military action. In this way, Britain and the United States will naturally not show weakness, and further impose a comprehensive economic blockade on Japan until both sides engage in a fire. It is reported that Japan will convene a special Privy Council meeting tomorrow to discuss urgent issues, and this meeting is of course related to Japan's future actions. It is expected that within five days, there will be a revelation of how the overall situation in the Far East will evolve. The world is facing such a major turning point in the situation and must sharpen itself in preparation to cope with all the most adverse events, without panicking and without being pessimistic, because all future changes are the most necessary in the process of clarifying the international situation, and are most conducive to the development of the democratic front. After a period of arduous struggle, we will be able to see the sun through the fog and regain the light.</p>
<h3>Soviet Decision: To Send a Mission to the U.S.; Perilous Situation in the Pacific; U.S. and Soviet Union Need to Strengthen Cooperation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th – Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the Soviet Union is sending a special mission to the United States to negotiate the purchase of military supplies. He was unable to elaborate today. Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Umansky, has already discussed what the Soviet Union wishes to order in the U.S., but details were not disclosed.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 26th – According to news here yesterday, a Soviet military delegation will soon be sent to Washington, possibly to discuss plans to deter Japanese expansion in the Far East. The delegation will be led by Lieutenant General Golikov, a senior member of the current delegation to England.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 26th – Undersecretary of State Welles told the press yesterday that he had no comment on the news from London that a Soviet military delegation would be invited to Washington to discuss plans to deter Japanese expansion in the Far East. Welles said he might have something to say later. At the same time, Mr. Welles declined to discuss the content of his lengthy conversation with Soviet Ambassador Umansky on Sunday.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 26th – Since the meeting between Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Umansky, and Welles, U.S.-Soviet cooperation will become closer. It is widely believed that U.S. willingness to aid the Soviet Union is closely related to the situation in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Departs for [the U.S.]</h3>

<h3>Japan's Invasion of Vietnam; China Adopts Self-Defense Measures; Strengthening Defenses on the Yunnan-Burma Border; Elite Central Troops Deployed to Reinforce Yunnan-Guangxi Border; Long Yun to Establish Headquarters in Baoshan to Protect the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Reliable sources indicate that the Chinese government is closely monitoring the situation in Vietnam, but the sources pointed out that China's policies are limited to strict self-defense, which means ensuring that the Yunnan-Guangxi border is not violated, and that the Yunnan-Burma Road remains active and unobstructed. In accordance with this principle, elite troops of the Central Army were deployed last year to take on the defense of that border. These Central Army troops have the best material equipment. The sources also said that Yunnan Chairman Long Yun is fully cooperating with the Central Government. To strengthen defenses, Chairman Long will establish headquarters in Baoshan, between the Nujiang and Mekong Rivers on the Yunnan-Burma Road. Reliable sources say that this measure is to prevent Japan from entering Yunnan via the rivers and the Mekong River basin in order to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road. Reliable sources said that Japan plans to invade Burma via Thailand in order to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road, but British defenses in eastern Burma have changed. In the past, Britain never considered the defense of the Burmese border, but now the entire eastern border is densely fortified with fortresses and airfields. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – At a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the 26th, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made serious criticisms of the Japanese military's invasion of Vietnam and the attitude taken by the Vichy government. The spokesman first stated that he had pointed out last week that Japan's repeated fabrications were a prelude to another act of aggression, which has now come to pass. Japan has indeed extended its policy of aggression to the entirety of Vietnam. Foreign Minister Guo's statement has clearly expressed the attitude and determination of the Chinese government. Since the entire territory of Vietnam has become an occupied area of the Japanese military, China, for the sake of self-defense, should take necessary measures to deal with this situation. This action by Japan is the culmination of the conquest of all of Vietnam, and at the same time, it is part of its entire plan to conquer the world. The shadow of "Eight Cords, One Universe" (Hakkō ichiu) now looms over the entire Pacific. When reporters asked for his views on the statement issued by the Vichy spokesman, the spokesman replied that he deeply regretted that the Vichy spokesman echoed the Japanese rumors, but under the current circumstances, this statement is not worth taking seriously. What we pay particular attention to is the attitude that the United States government has already stated, and the actions that the United States government is about to take. The urgency of the current situation cannot be addressed with empty words. Only action can stop action. It is heard that the U.S. President has ordered the freezing of Japanese funds, and the British government will also take the same measures. This is indeed a wise policy of the British and American governments, and can also be regarded as a concrete manifestation of the determination of Britain and America to stop Japan's expanding aggression with action. (26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a reception for the press today, spoke of recent developments in Vietnam, saying that China will take self-defense plans to cope with the overall situation. This is the starting point for the end of France's sovereignty over Vietnam and the continued aggression by Japan in nearby areas. The Vichy claims of threats made by the British and Americans against Vietnam are not worth taking seriously. What is worth paying attention to are the actions that the U.S. government will announce to deal with this matter. Today, empty words are of no help; only action is effective. Therefore, all parties are now paying attention to the actions to be announced by the United States and the United Kingdom. When asked about Eden's claim of consulting with China, the spokesman replied that he was unable to comment on the issue. However, any aggression by Japan is not only related to China, but also related to friendly nations. Someone also asked what steps the United Kingdom and the United States seem to be taking. The spokesman replied that implementing a complete economic blockade against Japan would of course be the most effective step. Foreign Minister Guo also criticized the developments in Vietnam, saying that the Japanese government has now forcibly seized new land, sea, and air force bases in southern Vietnam from the French government. This move has expanded Japan's aggression in Vietnam and will make its southward advance plan one step closer. Therefore, the entire area of Vietnam can now only be regarded as being practically under Japanese military occupation. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that China will take necessary steps, because Vietnam should now be regarded as an area occupied by the Japanese. The spokesman accused Japan of promoting its policies of aggression, enslavement, and plunder throughout Vietnam. The spokesman said that China does not view the statements issued by the Vichy government in the current situation as important. The spokesman said that the United States should take action to stop Japan's current strategy, and should not only rely on empty words. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – At yesterday morning's routine meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Council, Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi reported. Guo did not criticize Vietnam's surrender, but said that seeing Japan's decisive action, the idea that the Konoe Cabinet was more stable could be shattered. As for whether Japan will advance south or north in the future, it will be judged by which is more advantageous. In other words, Japan will only decide its movements based on the standard of small price and large gains. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>Details of the Detention of Two British Ships by the Japanese; British Embassy Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Reuters, this dispatch – The Information Office of the British Embassy issued the following statement: "Various conflicting reports have been published concerning the unloading of cargo from the 'Guangdong' and 'Hydamailles,' ordered by the Japanese authorities, including statements made by a Japanese military spokesman. The facts of the case are as follows: The textile machinery purchased by the Netherlands East Indies government and unloaded from the 'Guangdong' has reportedly been admitted by the Netherlands government to be their fault, and they will bear full responsibility, because it was not inspected by the Japanese authorities before being loaded onto the British ship. This Consulate-General has no knowledge of this and doubts that the Netherlands government would make such a statement. The goods had followed all customs procedures and there was no reason for further inspection. It was not until the goods had passed through customs and were being loaded onto the 'Guangdong' that the Japanese Military Police raised objections and opposed the loading. After detailed explanations were given to the Japanese authorities that the goods were purchased by the Netherlands East Indies authorities, the 'Guangdong' was detained and the loaded goods were unloaded. As for the general cargo carried on the 'Hydamailles' destined for Hong Kong, Rangoon, and Calcutta, after all the goods were loaded onto the ship and followed all customs procedures, the Japanese Military Police opposed their export. The goods were to be transported to several Chinese merchants in the above three ports. The shipowner did not admit that the goods belonged to Chongqing or that the goods should be inspected by the Japanese authorities. Now the goods have been unloaded by the shipowner at the Gonghexiang Wharf and detained by the Japanese authorities pending a decision on whether or not to allow them to be exported."</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Informs Japanese Government of Abolition of Various Commercial Treaties; Imperial Departments Freeze Japanese Funds; Federated Malay States Makes Military Preparations; Dutch East Indies is Discussing Steps to Take</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th – According to responsible sources, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has notified the Japanese government that Britain intends to abolish the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, the 1934 Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, and the 1937 Burmese-Japanese Commercial Treaty. It is heard that the British government consulted with the various Dominions on this action, and they all expressed their approval. The effective dates of abolition will be in accordance with the provisions of each treaty. For example, the notification period for the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty is twelve months, and the other two treaties are six months. As of now, Britain has not taken any steps to freeze Chinese assets in Britain. It is heard that Britain's actions will be based on the wishes of the Chinese government. The Chinese side has not yet made such a request to Britain. Reuters, Ottawa, 26th – According to Canadian Prime Minister King, Canada has responded to the United States by freezing Japanese assets in Canada and, at the request of the Chinese government, freezing Chinese assets. Canada has taken the necessary plans to prevent Japanese expatriates from withdrawing their assets in Canada. A few hours after the U.S. President announced the freezing action, the authorities here issued a statement stating that no financial transactions involving Japanese expatriates may be made without the special permission of the Foreign Exchange Control Board. Prime Minister King also said that the current methods for Chinese expatriates in Canada to remit patriotic and charitable funds will not be affected by the freezing order. A spokesman said that he knew that the assets of Japanese expatriates in Canada had been frozen for at least a week for various purposes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 26th – The government of the Straits Settlements has ordered the freezing of Japanese and Chinese assets. Reuters, Singapore, 26th – Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, and the government spokesman's announcement that plans to resist the Japanese occupation of Vietnam have been agreed upon, have satisfied everyone. It is felt that a positive action will finally be realized to resist Japanese aggression. A senior official told Reuters that the era of empty words has now passed, and we have finally realized the need to order the other party to stop. As for the theoretical question of whether the defined action is purely economic in nature, or both economic and military, it has not caused much concern here. After months of continuous preparation, Malaya now believes that it can cope with any situation. This is not only true of Malaya, but of the entire ABCD line in the Far East. The troops are now eager to try. An officer told reporters, "The gloves have now been taken off, and a thumbs-up will soon be given here." This sentence can represent the spirit of anticipation for development here. It is gratifying to see that Britain is conducting consultations on the same speed with China and the Dutch East Indies and with the United States regarding the Far East issue.</p>
<p>All Civilized Nations in the Far East Express Excitement and Joy</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 26th – The entire ABCD line in the Far East is excited about President Roosevelt's order to freeze Japanese assets. Not only for the special nature of this retaliatory action, but mostly for the speed with which it was taken. It was feared that although the democratic countries had clearly decided to take action against Japan's new aggression in Vietnam, it would take some time to realize it. This emotion of necessary patience has been eliminated invisibly in the joy of yesterday's action, because it is recognized that this action will certainly shock the Japanese. People here believe that the Japanese military and political authorities must now understand that the ABCD line in the Far East is not just making a show of force, and that there is a dangerous signal for continued expansion. Well-informed people here compare the current situation to Europe after Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, meaning that if Japan continues to invade or expand, it will encounter military resistance. It is hoped that Japan can recognize this point. If the Japanese do not see this, then the responsibility for their repeated claims to want to avoid the spread of war to the Pacific will be borne by themselves.</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 26th – The U.S. order to freeze Japanese funds was extremely welcomed by the Chinese side today, saying that this order was the beginning of President Roosevelt's actively policy of ending appeasement towards Japan that he hinted at yesterday. According to them, after the freezing of Japanese funds, Japan has no way to purchase American goods except through China and the countries of Central and South America. On the contrary, China can obtain American goods through Lend-Lease loans and barter. Apart from the highest-ranking officials, the general public was shocked by the news that Chinese funds had also been frozen at Chongqing's request, and the petty bourgeoisie who had U.S. dollars deposited in American banks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila were also somewhat panicked. They asked whether the frozen funds were going to be transferred to the Chinese government and whether the assets of major Chinese investors who invested in the United States and were operated by American companies would also be subject to the freezing order. In the past two or three years, Chinese people have disposed of their main property in this way.</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Joint Defense Agreement Established in Vietnam; Tokyo Government Officially Announces 30,000 Japanese Troops to be Stationed in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: The Japanese government announced this afternoon that Japan and France have established a joint defense agreement for Vietnam. The content of the agreement was not disclosed, only stating that Japan intends to strictly adhere to existing obligations, promising to guarantee the integrity and sovereignty of Vietnamese territory. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry also issued a statement, briefly stating that since reaching a settlement last August in which France allowed Japan to station troops in Vietnam, the historical relationship between Japan and Vietnam has grown closer. However, recent changes in Asia and Europe have greatly affected Vietnam, even threatening its security. Japan, for the sake of self-defense, cannot ignore the possibility of unrest enveloping Vietnam. Therefore, negotiations initiated by Japanese Ambassador Kato in Vichy proceeded rapidly, and the joint defense agreement for Vietnam was established on July 21st. This agreement will not only create a closer relationship between Japan and France, but also greatly contribute to the stability, co-existence, and co-prosperity of the Greater East Asia. As for the Japanese government's intention to strictly abide by all articles of the Japan-France agreement regarding Vietnam, and to respect Vietnam's territorial integrity and sovereignty, it goes without saying. Japan will further increase its efforts to promote friendly relations between Japan and France, so as to realize the co-prosperity of both countries.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Vichy, 26th: A French government communiqué issued this morning at 4:00 AM (11:00 AM Shanghai time) announced that the Franco-Japanese joint defense agreement for Vietnam has been established. The communiqué stated that military and technical agreements have not yet been completed and are currently under review. French authorities insist that this final defense plan respects Vietnam's territorial integrity and French sovereignty. Cabinet Coordinator Darlan convened a cabinet meeting at 5:00 PM today to review the situation in the Far East and the Franco-Japanese negotiations regarding Japan's acquisition of bases in Vietnam. Marshal Pétain will end his vacation and return here today. Reuters, Hanoi, 26th: Representative Sumita of the Japanese military mission and his staff left here this morning for Saigon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 26th: According to the most reliable sources, the terms of the Franco-Japanese agreement regarding Vietnam are as follows: (1) Japan occupies Cam Ranh Bay; (2) Japan occupies the Saigon air force base; (3) 4,000 Japanese troops are stationed in Vietnam.</p>
<p>International News Service, New York, 26th: According to a report from Chongqing to here by the National Broadcasting Company, French Indochina has allowed Japan to occupy Cam Ranh Bay and station 12,000 troops at Saigon, Cape St. Jacques, and various airfields in southern Vietnam.</p>
<p>Kunming, 26th: According to well-informed sources here, more than 30,000 Japanese army troops will land in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Saigon, 26th: It was learned today that although the Franco-Japanese agreement permitting Japan to establish bases in southern Vietnam will take effect here next Tuesday, it is believed that Japanese troops will not land here before the end of this month. It is reported that in addition to establishing bases and stationing troops in important areas of southern Vietnam, Japanese warships will also be stationed in Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. A representative of the Japanese military delegation stated that it will take considerable time for Japanese military aircraft to arrive in southern Vietnam because factories, ground personnel, and gasoline pumps must first be deployed to support the aircraft. An authoritative official stated that only a small number of Japanese warships will be stationed here, declaring that approximately four destroyers will be stationed in and around Saigon, and one cruiser and three destroyers will be stationed in Cam Ranh Bay.</p>
<p>Japanese Invasion of Vietnam Supported by Germany and Italy</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 26th: A government spokesman announced yesterday that the German government had informed the Japanese government that the Germans would adopt cooperative measures in Vichy and Vietnam to resist British aggression in the Far East. The spokesman criticized the United States for interfering in the Eastern Hemisphere, saying that President Roosevelt and Undersecretary of State Welles "are pursuing war throughout the world." The spokesman continued, saying that he believed the Japanese would give a proper response to the German assurance at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 26th: Gaeda commented that the Japanese military occupation of bases in Vietnam is the first stage of its southward advance, and Berlin and Rome were notified in advance on July 15th. The German and Italian governments have fully agreed to this matter. The conditions Japan presented to Vietnam were: (1) Japanese troops will be stationed in Vietnamese territory; (2) Japanese troops will be allowed to establish naval and air force bases; (3) The integrity of Vietnamese territory and sovereignty will be recognized. Japan has now stepped into the gateways of Singapore and the Philippines and is increasingly close to the Dutch East Indies. In addition to the two military ports already occupied by Japan in Vietnam, Cam Ranh Bay and Beta Long have now been added, allowing Japan to completely control all of Vietnam and the waters where British and American bases are concentrated, thereby negating the effectiveness of the chain of encirclement of Japan by Britain and the United States. This simple fact is sufficient to demonstrate the significance of Japan's southward advance. From this, Britain and the United States can no longer gain a military advantage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Meeting Discusses Economic and International Situation; National Mobilization Committee to Control Metals</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: The cabinet held a regular meeting yesterday to discuss the Treasury Minister's report on the economic situation, and Foreign Minister Toyoda also explained recent international developments. It is widely believed that Treasury Minister Ogura will discuss all the possibilities for Japan in the event that Britain and the United States freeze Japanese assets. The National General Mobilization Committee is now preparing four measures for immediate implementation, submitting them to the 16th meeting next Wednesday for approval. These four measures are: (1) Control of metals; (2) Organization of large industries; (3) Management of seaports and transportation; (4) Management of power distribution. Tokyo newspapers continue to say that China, Britain, and the United States are threatening Vietnam, and that the security of Vietnam is necessary for the fulfillment of the Japan-Vietnam treaty, so the Japanese army cannot tolerate foreign interference. At the same time, the official document sent by the United States to Japanese Ambassador Nomura has only been published here in outline, and official circles are currently studying this document. Well-informed sources predict that Japan will issue a stern rebuttal.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th: The Japanese government did not comment yesterday on Undersecretary of State Welles' criticism of its occupation of Vietnam. It is reported that Japanese officials will not issue any document in response to Welles' criticism. Newspapers have also not published the full text of Welles' remarks. Unofficial Japanese figures believe that Welles' remarks will make Japan feel unpleasant and predict that the government will issue a reply to explain Japan's position in East Asia after discussing the issues raised by Welles. Observers believe that Welles' remarks will cause Japan-US relations to become increasingly tense, as Japanese newspapers have implemented anti-American propaganda after hearing that the United States is encircling Japan and interfering in Japan's "new order."</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that maintaining peace in the Pacific is currently most beneficial to the United States. The failure of the Axis powers hinges on peace in the Pacific, so the United States must avoid a direct conflict with Japan. The United States cannot lightly challenge the Japanese navy at this time. It is expected that the United States will now strive to maintain peace in the Pacific, warning that Japan should maintain its highest level of spiritual and material efficiency to cope with any contingency.</p>
<h3>Thai Troops Ordered to Prepare for Any Eventuality; British Ambassador Visits Thai Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: Japanese sources say that the Thai cabinet convened a special meeting to consider the new situation in the Far East. Troops have been ordered to prepare for any eventuality, and large anti-aircraft teams will soon be organized.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: British Ambassador Sir Josiah Crosby visited the Thai Prime Minister yesterday afternoon for an hour and a half. The Thai Prime Minister also holds the post of Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 26th: Today's Thai Siri newspaper said that the statements made by the Japanese are often contradictory. The Japanese once said that Britain boasted that its troops stationed in the East were only one-fifth of their claimed strength, and not even enough to defend Malaya. Now they say that Britain plans to invade Vietnam. Isn't this self-contradictory?</p>
<p>Associated Press, Bangkok, 26th: The King of Thailand yesterday awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand to the Japanese Minister and Colonel Tamura, and five other members of the Japanese Embassy were also awarded other types of medals.</p>

<h3>US-British Shipping Cooperation; US Sends Experts to the Far East; Headquarters in Singapore</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 26th: A spokesman for the Maritime Commission said yesterday that the commission had dispatched experts to various ports in the Far East and Africa to coordinate the shipping of vessels in times of emergency. Those stationed in Honolulu are Colonel Froude, Manila is Johnson, and Singapore is Gedjil. Their important tasks are to transport aid to Britain and load military raw materials for return to the country. The Commission also believes that they will use all Pacific vessels for shipping with significant strength, as the Pacific coast is the main source of military raw materials. The experts will also cooperate with Britain and other allied countries. At the same time, Philippine Resident Commissioner Elizalde yesterday discussed the matter with President Gray of the American President Lines for about an hour, possibly as Gray plans to go to Africa as a special representative of Commerce Secretary Jones, and the trip is related to the loan to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 26th: The Maritime Commission is sending seven shipping experts to the Far East and Africa. The commission said that the experts are stationed in Durban, Calcutta, Singapore, and Honolulu, but two are stationed in the Red Sea area and added that the headquarters are in Singapore.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Uncovers Nazi Conspiracy to Invade Turkey; Obtains Secret Maps and Documents; Half of the Content Has Been Notified to the Turkish Government</h3>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 26th: The Red Army, which defeated the German 52nd Chemical Division on July 15th, obtained secret maps and plans regarding Turkey and the European part of the Straits west of Sytschewo. The documents include:</p>
<p>(1) A booklet entitled "Military Geographical Statistics of the European Part of Turkey (including the Straits)," with charts and plans concerning Turkish airfields, military locations, and transportation; (2) A map of the European part of Turkey, scale 1:500,000, indicating the main roads of Turkey; (3) A military geographical plan of Istanbul, scale 1:15,000; (4) A map of the Bosphorus, scale 1:100,000, indicating Turkish military targets; (5) A map of the Gulf of Izmit, scale 1:100,000, indicating military targets.</p>
<p>All of these documents are marked "For Official Use Only." Turkish military targets are indicated by symbols, such as airfields, arsenals, ports, hardware factories, bridges, and even the condition of each object, as well as building materials, are explained. The number of Turkish troops, their locations, vehicle numbers, landing sites, the area of ​​the Klais harbor, and the depth of seawater at various locations are all included in the booklet. The advance routes of motorized units are also indicated. For example, the original text on page 9 reads: "The most difficult task for any army attempting to occupy or cross Turkey is to cross the Straits. The possibility of such crossing of the Straits will be stated in the section describing the Bosphorus, Istanbul, the Sea of ​​Marmara, and the Dardanelles."</p>
<p>Page 26 concerns the issue of stationing troops in Istanbul. The original text reads, "The most suitable location for European troops and headquarters is the Pera district. There are seven large hotels in this area, the best of which are the Pera Palace, the Tokatlian Hotel, and several smaller hotels. In addition, the French school and the German school can be used as administrative agencies. Taxim has wide avenues, most suitable for building barracks and parking lots."</p>
<p>On page 15, the fascist aggressors discuss the possibility of landing in the northern Black Sea, stating that landing is very difficult due to the large waves and rugged coastline, and can only be carried out using small fishing boats. South of this, landing is slightly easier, but will encounter fierce fire from the "Chatalja" line of defense.</p>
<p>These documents prove the goals of the Hitler government. These documents have been distributed by the German High Command to the various corps that will implement the plan. In the past, German fascists have repeatedly spread rumors of a Soviet "conspiracy to invade Turkey." Now they have revealed their ferocious face. On the one hand, German aggressors sign agreements with Turkey to divert its attention, and on the other hand, they secretly prepare to invade Turkey. The Soviet Union and Turkey have extremely friendly relations, so it is deemed necessary to notify the Turkish side. The Soviet authorities have notified the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union of Hitler's conspiracy to invade Turkey and the evidence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Zoo Saves Money by Feeding Dog Meat to Tigers</h3>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 25th: A certain Japanese zoo keeps five tigers, feeding them about 42 pounds of rabbit meat every day. The zoo authorities recently decided to switch to dog meat because the cost was too high, saving 500 yen in expenses per month. When the tigers first saw the dog meat, they sniffed it briefly and turned away, going on strike from eating. After a few days, they were forced to eat it reluctantly due to hunger.</p>
<h3>Latin American Countries Suppress Nazi Activities; US Says No Intention of Occupying Liberia</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: Several Latin American republics have recently taken self-defense actions to prevent the sabotage activities of private and public Nazi groups that have long enjoyed preferential treatment. News from Latin America received in London in recent days confirms that the long-suspected Nazi plan to first weaken South America and then invade the South American continent via the so-called Dakar Strait is true. It is expected that the investigation by South and Central American authorities into German espionage and conspiracy work will have surprising developments. The Bolivian government's pre-emptive move to curb the Nazi riot and expel the German Minister Winterle shows that the danger is imminent. London's criticism compares the failed rebellion of Rashid Ali in Iraq with the recent events in Bolivia, and calls it another failed German conspiracy. Chile's request that the former German Minister to Bolivia, Winterle, leave the country immediately and not stay is very satisfying here, and it can also prove that what the committee investigating Nazi activities in Chile recently discovered must be very serious. Argentine political police recently searched several offices of Nazi organizations (located in the same building as the German Embassy and Consulate) and seized several documents. What they have discovered will be announced one after another. General comments in London say that no country, no matter how far away from Berlin, can escape the Nazi threat unless it takes strong preventive action.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th: Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States has absolutely no intention of occupying the Republic of Liberia in Africa. It is reported that Parisian newspapers recently spread the rumor that the US government is preparing to occupy Liberia and suggested that a certain European power should occupy Dakar for protection.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: The Air Ministry Information Office stated that American-made Flying Fortresses and other British bombers heavily bombed the German battleships "Gneisenau" on Thursday. The Flying Fortress crews had received special training. They were ordered to depart after breakfast, carrying oxygen, and flew to over 36,000 feet to aim and drop bombs. Other British bombers also flew in to bomb. German aircraft took off to intercept fiercely. At night, British aircraft bombed the German naval bases of Kiel and Emden, both of which caught fire.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: German radio acknowledged that British aircraft attacked Berlin, saying that British aircraft flew to Germany last night, and after fierce resistance by German fighters, only a few were able to reach the city of Berlin, dropping several bombs in residential areas, causing no military or economic damage, and causing several deaths and injuries. Five aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 26th: Well-informed sources who recently arrived here from Berlin told a Reuters reporter that the people of Berlin are now making major preparations because they expect to be subjected to more intense attacks by the British Air Force due to the short nights and long days. When he left Berlin, a German friend said goodbye, saying, "Please pray for us this winter." The Germans are all concerned about the British Air Force and the food shortage next year, and fear that the Americans will go further in this war and repeat the history of the last great war. Throughout Germany, there is deep disappointment and anxiety about the progress of the war in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>American-Made Flying Fortresses Heavily Attack German Naval Ports; British Aircraft also Fly to Berlin to Bomb</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that according to assessments, British aircraft attacked the German battleships "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" yesterday, shooting down a total of 21 German fighters, including the 12 already announced.

<h3>Central Front Red Army Launches Large-Scale Counteroffensive, German Left and Right Wing Offensives Halted</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - British military circles have learned that on the Smolensk line, the Soviet army has launched a very large-scale counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 26th - An official communique stated that the Red Army, resisting the German forces in Smolensk, has defeated the Fifth Nazi Infantry Division in a counteroffensive. Neutral observers here seem to believe that the Soviet army is firmly defending the central front and its left and right flanks (namely, the Proskurov-Novgorod area in the north and the Bobruisk area in the south). The German offensives in the Polkov area and Zhitomir southwest of Kiev have also been apparently hindered. Fierce battles are ongoing on all fronts. As for the situation on the Finnish front, there is still no clear information. The German news there is attempting to break into Petrozavodsk. The communique also stated that the Soviet fleet is still cooperating with the army to attack German motorized units and German airfields.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 26th - Last night and this morning, our army continued its heroic resistance in Polotsk, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhitomir. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses, which has been confirmed by enemy command reports (the reports were intercepted by our side). Yesterday, our air force shot down 47 enemy planes and assisted the army in fighting enemy mechanized units.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that the German attacks on Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev are still being blocked. Currently, the German army is probing the Soviet army's lines for possible weaknesses along a 2,000-mile front in an attempt to succeed. The German army in the center has been deadlocked in front of Smolensk for a long time. In this area, the German army has penetrated the Soviet lines, forming a wedge shape, with its head and tail far apart, and there is a danger of being attacked from the side by the Soviet army. According to the latest Soviet communiques, fierce battles are still ongoing in five front-line areas. The German side has not claimed a major victory, only stating that "the war is proceeding according to plan." On the central front, in the Smolensk area and Polotsk and Nevel northwest of the city, there were continuous major battles last night. Because the Soviet army is resisting strongly, the German side cannot gain a military advantage and is now using propaganda methods to try to persuade the Soviet army to abandon its arms. The official Italian news agency in Berlin reported that the German army is now using powerful loudspeakers to urge the surrounded Soviet army to abandon its arms. Some German soldiers in the propaganda team have been awarded the Iron Cross for successfully installing these loudspeakers near enemy positions.</p>
<p>Soviet Capital Air Defense Strong, German Night Raid Foiled</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 26th - The previous night, Moscow enjoyed a relatively quiet night because the Soviet air force had defeated the German aircraft group that was attempting to attack the Soviet capital for the fourth time. Night fighters and anti-aircraft guns drove away all German planes. Only a few German planes broke through into the skies over Moscow to carry out indiscriminate bombing. At that time, two were shot down. According to official reports, in four air raids, the Soviet Union's defense measures shot down a total of 44 German planes. 10% of German planes that attacked the Soviet Union in the previous three raids have been shot down. On Thursday night, Moscow had two consecutive air raid alerts, one lasting 90 minutes and the other lasting nearly two hours. Thousands of men and women, expecting an air raid, took their food and bedding into the tunnels and stations at night, believing that the tunnels and stations were safe havens.</p>
<p>German-Soviet Five-Week War Casualties Reach Three Million</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - Soviet political commentator Avelin broadcast from Moscow last night, stating that the German-Soviet war in the past five weeks has resulted in a total of three million deaths and injuries, which must be blamed on the fascist criminals who are poisoning all of Europe.</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 26th - It was announced here yesterday that after the Soviet troops in the Nevel and Mogilev areas collapsed in the German encirclement, 20,000 Soviet troops in the Nevel area and 10,000 Soviet troops in the Mogilev area were captured by the German army.</p>
<p>German Side Frankly Admits Preparing for Poison Gas Warfare</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 26th - According to German officials, the Geneva Convention does not prohibit the preparation for poison gas warfare. All units are studying poison gas warfare and preparing to conduct poison gas warfare. No military authority can risk not preparing to deal with the enemy's use of poison gas. If the Soviet Union uses the discovery of German instructions for preparing for poison gas warfare as an excuse to launch poison gas warfare, the German army will respond appropriately.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - Moscow Radio stated that the Soviet side has seized German instructions to its troops on the use of poison gas and showed them to foreign reporters in Moscow. The instructions pay close attention to artillery units equipped with poison gas bombs and poison gas mines. Several sections of the instructions are as follows: Artillery units equipped with chemical bombs are designed to prevent the enemy from fighting, hinder their actions, reduce their combat effectiveness, and prevent them from breaking through the lines. Enemy troops can be affected by gas far from the gas explosion point, much farther than the range of shrapnel. The enemy cannot estimate the extent of the gas danger, so they are also psychologically affected. The effectiveness of artillery units equipped with poison gas depends on the weather and terrain. Calm weather or a slight breeze, cloudy skies, and weak sunlight are most suitable for gas. The use of certain gases is suitable for dark weather and drizzle. This climate is mostly available in the early morning or evening and at night, which is the most suitable time for artillery units equipped with chemical bombs to operate. Today, the Berlin official news agency published an article acknowledging that the methods of gas warfare have been distributed to the German army commanders on the Eastern Front, but said that the German military leaders' research of these rules is only a common occurrence. If the Soviet side wants to use the acquisition of these rules as an excuse to start gas warfare, Germany will respond appropriately.</p>
<p>Germany Plans to Invade Soviet Oil Region Through Turkey</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 26th - Due to the activities of the Bulgarian army, there are reports that the German-Soviet front war may temporarily subside. Military observers believe that the German-Bulgarian coalition forces may pass through Turkey and attack the Soviet Caucasus line. The purpose of this plan is to seize the Batumi and Baku oil production centers. Military observers believe that this plan will be implemented before September 15, as the arrival of the Caucasus cases is quite early.</p>

<h3>The Policy of Appeasement of Foreign Exchange Is Unreliable: The US Finally Freezes Japanese Funds; The Chinese Government Is Willing to Be Included in the Freeze Even at the Cost of Sacrifice; Only Hoping for Concrete Measures Soon to Comfort the Hopes of the People</h3>
<p>Our newspaper has often stated that the Shanghai foreign exchange market involves too much, with countless problems that are difficult to remedy. Such a complex issue, tied to national policy, must consider both national economy and people's livelihood, weigh both domestic and foreign concerns, compare the pros and cons, and then strictly ban speculative trading and conspiracy arbitrage. It must also adopt effective methods to prevent it, while making every effort to maintain legitimate commercial needs. At that time, we hoped that Fox would return to Hong Kong after his visit to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, two weeks later, the signs of an impending issue have already begun to appear. During these two weeks, we have only seen Japanese merchants selling US dollars and receiving legal tender, in large quantities. As the proverb goes, a halo around the moon indicates wind, and dampness on the plinth foretells rain. From this, we know that the prospect of freezing funds is not far off. Yesterday, our newspaper's foreign exchange report was still headlined "Only Someone Inside Is Selling US Dollars," the implication of which is evident. Unexpectedly, the US took action to freeze Japanese funds yesterday morning. The Chinese government, willing to sacrifice, is also included in the freeze. Such a spirit of a brave man cutting off his hand when bitten by a venomous snake is admirable, and should have been done long ago. The reason why it has been delayed until today is that British and American merchants are still engaged in compromise, unwilling to push their financial and commercial power to create a buffer in conflict and appeasement in politics. This has made it impossible to control the Shanghai black market, all because of selfish desires, which lead to blindness and inaccurate perceptions. For example, those who have foreign exchange, those who engage in arbitrage, and those who engage in speculative trading, naturally do not support foreign exchange controls. The more chaotic the market, the better, so they can fish in troubled waters. This bad mentality is no different from rice merchants advancing to the south.</p>
<p>Now that the freeze has been implemented, the prices of all kinds of commodities soared yesterday. This mentality assumes that once foreign exchange is frozen, it will be difficult to obtain, and the legal tender will lose its support. The price of Japanese fresh banknotes has risen every day, reflecting the mentality of Shanghai merchants, which is completely unnecessary. It should be understood that freezing Chinese foreign exchange, in reality, only freezes the foreign exchange within the occupied areas. The foreign exchange of free China is originally under control. Those who need foreign exchange for legitimate business needs are supplied as usual, without any inconvenience. Only Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have always been laissez-faire, allowing people to take whatever they want without restriction. If this loophole is not plugged, the effect of the freeze will be equal to zero. Therefore, it must be linked to achieve complete success. But it is believed that the Chinese government will not ignore the welfare of the people in the occupied areas and the legitimate commercial activities that should exist. It is expected that there will be appropriate solutions to help them operate. This is one aspect. There are still many British and American businesses in Shanghai that trade with British and American businesses. If it can be guaranteed that they will not be used as cover or leak information, and since they are all on the same side, obtaining foreign exchange will naturally be easier. This is another aspect. For the foreign exchange needed for the necessities of people's lives, the Chinese government will still maintain it under a reliable audit system. However, the supply of foreign exchange for luxury goods and non-essential items will definitely be restricted. This is another aspect. As for those who have foreign exchange, there is no need to panic. The Chinese government will never allow the legitimate property of Chinese and foreign merchants to suffer losses. This is another aspect. However, those who have sold short may be in trouble, and there is nowhere to cover. Therefore, the exchange rate rebounded yesterday, which is a deserved consequence. It is hoped that the government will unify the supply and demand of foreign exchange, so as to adjust its trend and maintain the appropriate level of both national economy and people's livelihood, increase the value of legal tender, and alleviate the suffering of the people. This is not only true for the livelihood of the people in the occupied areas, but also has interconnected effects on the livelihood of the people in the free areas. Therefore, we hope for further indication soon to comfort the hopes of the people.</p>
<p>Shorts Forced to Cover Heavily</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listed exchange rates did not change. In the grey market for British and American exchange rates, it first loosened and then suddenly tightened sharply. In the morning, Japanese banks peddled US dollars without any takers. Even the HSBC bank sold some. The US dollar was sold at 5.40625 yuan, and the British exchange at 3 shillings and 25 pence. Unexpectedly, at 9:30, the British government announced the freezing of Japanese funds and funds in the Chinese occupied areas. Speculators in the city, who were currently in a short position, rushed to cover their positions, in a very large amount amidst the chaos. During the process, British and American commercial banks successively sold off, but the gold price soared, and speculative buying increased unabated. At noon, the US dollar tightened to 5.125 yuan, and the British exchange tightened to 3 shillings and 14.0625 pence. Later, the US dollar alone rebounded slightly, but the tightening of the British exchange was still substantial. Half-day trading was very active. Chinese merchants bought about 1.5 million US dollars. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.</p>
<p>US Dollar Tightens to 5.125 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning's foreign telegraphic dispatches, the silver markets in the UK and India have fallen, while the US silver market has not changed. The exchange rates of various countries against the British and American currencies have been flat. The central government's listed exchange rates have not changed. The opening price of the domestic interbank market for spot British exchange was 3 shillings and 2.34375 pence, and the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan. After the opening, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yokohama Specie Bank came to offer August US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, but there were no takers. It was heard that HSBC sold this month at 5.375 yuan, and foreign banks traded among themselves at 5.40625 yuan. The market situation loosened. The British exchange also hardened to 3 shillings and 25 pence. The HSBC listed exchange rates were all flat. The silver balancing tax was reduced by 25 points, calculated at 24.25%. Later, foreign dispatches came, and speculators rushed to cover their short positions and went long, vying to buy July and August at 5.375 yuan without success. They then pushed it up to 5.3125 yuan and 5.28125 yuan. At that time, the US bank slightly showed willingness to supply, and it rebounded to 5.3125 yuan at around 10 o'clock, which could be closed. However, people's minds were already going up. After 10:30, the foreign bank's willingness to supply faded again, and speculative buying rose again, vying to close July and August at 5.25 yuan and 5.1875 yuan. Near noon, it tightened further to 5.125 yuan, and the British exchange also tightened to 3 shillings and 14.0625 pence. They had all tightened below the HSBC listed exchange rates. The small counter of that bank also softened the US dollar from 5.3125 yuan to 5.125 yuan. Before the noon closing, foreign commercial banks saw the price and slightly supplied, and the US dollar rebounded to 5.21875 yuan. At the noon closing, both spot and August term were 3 shillings and 14.0625 pence for the British exchange, and 5.1875 yuan for the US dollar, a tightening of 0.09375 and 0.15625 yuan respectively compared to the previous day's evening closing of spot and futures.</p>
<h3>Gold Market: Sudden Huge Changes; Spot Trading at 7,400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's black market suddenly underwent shocking and huge changes. It first fell, once breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark, then suddenly surged wildly, soaring beyond 6,600 yuan. Everyone's mood suddenly turned from fatigue to firm. Initially, it was because Japanese banks were peddling foreign exchange without anyone paying attention, so under the selling pressure of securities brokers and bill brokers, it retreated to 6,482 yuan. At 9:28, Reuters telegraphed that the US government announced the simultaneous freezing of funds of both China and Japan. The US dollar and British exchange both rose sharply amidst the 1.5 million yuan covering spree by speculators. A fierce buying frenzy also rose in the market. The Shanghai West Side gangs, such as Yi Yuan, De Fu, Yi Da (buying eight or nine thousand taels), Xin Feng, Yong, etc., turned long and bought heavily. Although Heng Ji (selling 15,000 taels), Da Feng (selling 10,000 taels), Tian Yuan, etc., repeatedly tried to sell, the supply and demand were still disparate, and retail investors had also turned long. With buying pressure and no selling pressure, the price rose higher and higher, soaring to a high price of 6,670 yuan. It then retreated slightly, and continued to rise by 94 yuan. The upward trend reignited after the closing. More than 100,000 taels were traded in the first half of the day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. The off-market price rose again to 6,660 yuan, with demand and no supply. The swap (July to August) seller offered 50 yuan to the buyer but did not trade. The cash price soared even more sharply, breaking the historical record of 7,250 yuan on May 6 last year, and creating an unprecedented high price of 7,400 yuan. In the morning, Zhongxing sold 20 taels to Chengji and 40 taels to Decheng, at a price of 7,300 yuan. By noon, it had risen to 7,350 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 7,400 yuan. A certain gold shop had sold it, a rise of 230 yuan. Jewelry gold rose by 20 yuan, also creating a high price of 760 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Market Expands</p>
<p>Since the morning, because the foreign exchange reported loosening, and the Japanese bank offered US dollars at 5.40625 without takers, people's minds were very fatigued. Therefore, the market opened at 9:15 amidst selling pressure, and it had already fallen to 6,500 yuan, a low opening of 16 yuan. Yi Da, Xin Feng Yong, and Chi Da came to sell, and retail investors squeezed. The price continued to fall to 6,482 yuan. Suddenly, Yi Da and Xin Feng Yong came to recover and bought fiercely. Retail investors were in surprise, and favorable news came. The foreign exchange was difficult to sell even at 5.3125 yuan amidst the speculative buying spree. The buying wind expanded. Li Tai, Yi Yuan, Ding Sheng, Ren Cheng Yong, De Fu, and Tong Kang Yong all rose and bought heavily. Retail investors also turned long and advanced fiercely. The price suddenly soared by 100 yuan, reaching 6,580 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan could be closed again. Moreover, Xin Yuan, Tian Yuan, Tong Kang Yong, Heng Ji, and Da Feng all tried to sell hard, and a small pullback to 6,530 yuan was seen. At 10:20, the foreign exchange tightened and sharpened again amidst the speculative buying spree. Favorable rumors became even more prevalent. Yi Yuan, Yi Da, Xin Feng Yong, De Fu, and Li Tai reignited and bought heavily. Tong Kang Yong was particularly keen to buy. The price rose again by 140 yuan, reaching 6,670 yuan. At noon, the US dollar slightly recovered to 5.21875 yuan, which could be closed. Da Feng, Tian Yuan, and Heng Ji were still selling, and De Fu came out again. A decline of 60 yuan was initially seen. The noon closing was 6,610 yuan, a continued rise of 94 yuan compared to the previous day's evening closing price. Based on the closing price of August US dollars at 5.1875 yuan, it was 6,713 yuan, a squeeze of 103 yuan. After the closing, there was another buying spree, rising to 6,645 yuan. There was a high-low fluctuation of 188 yuan in the first half of the day. In the afternoon, the off-market price rose to 6,660 yuan with buyers. The cash gold price of the local brand gold shop was 7,500 yuan, and the closing price was within 7,400 yuan. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Also Sets Unprecedented High Price</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang initially listed 740 yuan. At 10:45, it rose by 5 yuan. At 11 o'clock, it rose another 5 yuan. At 12 o'clock, it was 5 yuan higher. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it rose another 5 yuan, reaching 760 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan, it was said.</p>
<h3>All Foreign Currencies Are Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, both spot and futures rose sharply. British and American gold pounds also rose sharply by 4 yuan. British gold notes rose by 1 yuan. The opening price of US gold notes was 1,871 yuan. After the opening, Li Ji, Ying Tai Lai, etc., sold, and it retreated to 64 yuan. Later, Shun Tai, Yong Xiang Xing, Bao Xiang, etc., bought vigorously, raising it to 1,913 yuan. Shun Tai Yong resold, and Zheng Da also sold, retreating to 1,895 yuan at the closing, a squeeze of 24 yuan compared to the previous day. The spot price was 18 yuan and 90 cents. The trend of Hong Kong notes was also firm. In addition, notes such as Singapore, Annam, Robi, Canada, and Philippines all trended upward. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes uniformly rose sharply. The former rose to 2 yuan and 10 cents, and the latter rose to 1 yuan and 74 cents.</p>
<h3>Securities: No One Knows What to Do in the Bond Market Amidst Freezing Announcements</h3>
<p>Yesterday's grey market for public bonds was due to the complexity of the rumors. Foreign news was very complicated. There were rumors that the United States had frozen Chinese and Japanese funds, and that the Shanghai US garrison troops were ordered to prepare to withdraw at any time. Most public bond practitioners did not know what to do. It should be expected to go down, but the market opened low. In half a day, the multiple parties were afraid of it falling, and they lifted it up to confuse people's eyes. Most of them, while at a loss, saw this and followed blindly to buy in. Type C opened at 69 yuan and 30 cents. After a brief period of hovering, it gradually rose, reaching a high price of 71 yuan. Hong Da, Lian Yi, Xie Xing Yuan, Tong Kang, and Heng Kang bought in, and Lian He, Yi Chang, Da Feng, and Run De sold out. However, the advance was sharp and the retreat was rapid, breaking through 71 yuan again. There are many changes in the future, and it is still difficult to be optimistic. As a result, it rose by another 55 to 95 cents, with a transaction volume of about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>For stock trading, 50 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy stock were traded at a price of 170 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Is Greatly Shaken: New Price of Double Horse at 1,649 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been hovering for many days, underwent a major change yesterday. This was because the United States froze funds to Japan, and China was also included in the freeze. As a result, the market was shaken, and speculative buying suddenly became rampant. Under this environment, general floating households had to rush to cover their positions, and the situation of course rose. However, actual transactions remained as quiet as ever, so the rise was roundabout. Today's peak price has broken through 1,642 yuan on July 3. Midway, it fell back to 1,522 yuan. Now, the high price has reached 1,649 yuan. Yesterday morning, the high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,649 yuan, and the low price was 1,605 yuan. In the afternoon, there were no transactions as usual at the end of the week, but encountering a large wave, it also moved yesterday, initially making 1,638 yuan, rising to 1,646 yuan, then returning to 1,639 yuan, and the final price was 1,646 yuan, it was said that someone wanted to buy.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, because American cotton continued to rise, and people's spirits were outstanding. The first lot price was 1,610 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,613 yuan. Then it was heard that after the standard gold market opened, it suddenly jumped to 787 yuan. The foreign exchange was reorganized, and the market buying spree rose sharply, rising to 1,618 and 1,619 yuan. There was a period of ups and downs here. Unexpectedly, around 11 o'clock, it was heard that foreign telegrams had arrived, and Chinese and Japanese funds had all been frozen. As a result, speculative buyers were active, and the buying sound in the market shook the sky. The market released 1,640 yuan, directly seeing it rise to 1,649 yuan. Subsequently, the current sales were not strong, and profit-takers released their holdings. The standard gold also went down, falling to 1,630 yuan. The price returned to 1,637 yuan after the closing. The amount of purchases by each gang in the first half of the day is listed below.</p>
<p>Morning market conditions of the gold Double Horse futures yarn, the trend was still uneven, and the market price was near weak and far firm. Because the floating longs were reselling in the near term, it was still weak by 1.5 yuan. However, when shooting to the far month, because the number of buyers increased, September suddenly rose by 5 yuan, and October rose by 7 yuan. Until after 10 o'clock, it was suddenly heard that the United States had frozen Japanese funds, and American cotton had also risen sharply. The gold price also rose sharply. At this time, buyers were excited, and the shorts were unfavorable and rushed to cover their positions. The price once rose sharply, with the August term soaring to 1,506 yuan, the September term to 1,566 yuan, and the October term to 1,583 yuan. Afterwards, because the rise was too fierce, it caused a part of the longs to take the opportunity to exit the market, and each month fell back by 17 to 23 yuan. The August term at noon closing still rose sharply by 33.5 yuan compared to the previous day, the September term rose by 31 yuan, and the October term rose by 20 yuan. The transaction volume increased sharply. A total of 22,000 bales were traded in half a day, a large increase of 15,100 bales compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, because the market was closed on Saturday, the opening, closing, high, and low prices in the first half of the day are recorded on the left (net market price).</p>
<h3>Cotton Market also Advances Quickly</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is very firm. One reason is that American cotton has been soaring. The second reason is that the foreign exchange has been frozen. The yarn market has jumped greatly, and the cotton market has followed suit. However, the factory's thinking is more flat, but speculative trading has greatly increased, and the market price is rising step by step.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that the trading of foreign cotton orders in Shanghai port is firm and expensive, but due to the very chaotic international situation and the gradually deteriorating Shanghai situation, the intention to purchase has subsided. Yesterday, except for the flower number houses that slightly had the intention to purchase spot goods, the cotton trading was not concerned at all.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is active, concentrated and firm due to the enthusiastic buying intentions of the public. At the same time, it has risen sharply because of the deteriorating cotton production and harvest situation, and the Washington political report that the agricultural loan department firmly opposes the release of loan cotton. As a result, the closing price yesterday rose by 42 to 48 pounds for each grade compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that the statistics of American cotton from August 1 last year to July 25 this year are recorded on the left (each bale is 500 pounds).</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first fell due to speculators selling, but then rebounded due to the firm rise in the stock market and other market conditions. As a result, the closing price rose and fell by 12 Robi. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be viewed as high by 4.45 Robi due to the high rise in American cotton.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Medicine Galangal Slightly Loosened</h3>
<p>Recently, medicine galangal has seen a slight weakening trend, because the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs have gone to the stomach and turned quiet, and the market price has reached its peak. However, the bottom remains small, and it has not been seen to be too small for a while. It is about 10 yuan lower than before. White-skinned medicine galangal is called at 215 yuan, and then it will be lowered.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Merchants Use Every Possible Means to Raise the Future Price Again on the Pretext that the Actual Rice Reserves Are Sufficient and Foreign Rice Flows Are Still the Same</h3>
<p>Foreign rice was still weak in the market yesterday morning because there were many stocks. The published survey of rice stocks in the city was 1,274,852 bags, and adding those that had not been surveyed, the total was 200 to 300,000 stone. There is Hong Kong rice supply in this street, and the supply from other ports is still lacking. Such a quantity is enough to resist the rise in market prices. Therefore, the market saw a decline of about 1 yuan in the morning. Unexpectedly, as soon as the saying that funds were frozen was spread, it immediately triggered the activities of speculative gangs, and the sound of buying rose, which was unusually exciting. The market price was shouted higher and higher. The fatigue that had been in the morning was broken, and the people's minds were passionate. The ball-kicking flow was even more active, and the small jiao rice in the morning market was 116 yuan, down to 114.5 yuan, and then from 116 yuan to 118 yuan. Yinghua Si spot was from 144 yuan to 146 yuan, and the period was from 144.5 yuan to 146.5 yuan. No. 2 Siam was 141 yuan. Other common goods from Min Dang opened to 123.5 yuan, the next was 118 yuan, and the special was 130 yuan. The Da Shi rice from Jiafo was 122.3 yuan, the central control was 117 yuan, the next was 115.8 yuan, and the special was from 127 yuan to 129 yuan. Only Dongjing tip rice had a narrow path, and it was slightly tightened. The opening medium grade was 109 yuan and 105 yuan, the high ration rice was 112 yuan, the broken tip was 91 yuan, and the next was 88 yuan, which was 23 to 4 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous market. The back market was still rounded and shouted high, so the opening market today may once again cause competition for hoarding between internal and external customers, and the market may rise again, which is also unpredictable. However, in fact, the rice reserves are sufficient, and the shipping is as smooth as ever.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive at the port. Those who arrived in recent days have already been reported in the previous reports. It is now known that the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 25th and brought 10,446 bags of foreign rice from Siam. It was docked at the wharf of this bank in Pudong to unload. It is heard that a large number of Vietnamese rice are on their way to Shanghai. The French company's Laoyasi wheel is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month and the beginning of the month, carrying a large amount of foreign rice from the west. The exact number is not yet known. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although the supply of thick and thin indica rice in the country is still limited, there are many goods with water stains due to the heavy rain. Therefore, the cargo owners clearly see that foreign rice is soaring and have no power to hold it, but seek to sell it. The local shops and stomachs are still calm. As a result, the market price has not changed and is only stable. The open South Port fresh early and late rice is 1412 yuan to 140 yuan, the special is 145 yuan, and the Wuxi original package overnight indica is 132 yuan.</p>
<p>The path of glutinous rice is still not strong. Only a few rice porridge burdens have scattered stomachs, so it is difficult for Hong Kong Baiyuan to keep pace with foreign rice, and it is only slightly tightened. As for domestic glutinous rice, the source is cut off, and the market goods are also scarce. It has not been heard to open.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rejuvenates: Demand in North China is Active and Japanese Merchants are Buying Heavily</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday's spot western flour market was weak and then rejuvenated. At first, a lot of Golden Dragon flour was transferred from Hong Kong, and the market was not particularly excited. Later, due to the active demand in North China, Japanese merchants were buying heavily in the market. In addition, the news of the foreign exchange freeze caused the ball-kicking hoarders to favor it. The opening price of Golden Dragon flour was raised to 32.2 yuan and 34 cents. The closing price was slightly loose, making 32.25 yuan. The Bastion flour was 33.05 yuan to 30.35 yuan, the Double Eagle brand was 32 yuan, and the Clock Tower brand Australian flour was 33.5 yuan after weighing, which was 35 cents higher than before. The total transaction volume was more than 20,000 bags, and the market situation was still unstable.</p>
<p>Wheat: The new wheat source, a little bit of two to three hundred arrived at the port in the near suburbs, all of which were sent to the Japanese factory's retail outlets for collection, and the selling price was still around 41 yuan. The Chinese factory bought it at 47 yuan, but there was no spot to collect.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market Has Changed and Everything Is Soaring</h3>
<p>Red and White Rock Candy: Yesterday's sugar market was very good due to the US freezing Chinese and Japanese funds and the inability to buy and settle import exchange bills, which led to prices soaring. The association划盘, the initial spot price of 24 rough white June population was 97.5 yuan, and then it reached 99 yuan. The back market reached 101 yuan.

<p>Oilseed Cake and Miscellaneous Grains: Yesterday's oil soybean cake market, due to the volatility of financial rumors, people's minds were firm, and speculative merchants took advantage of the trend to be active. As a result, the market was unanimously prosperous. As a result, edible oil rose by 34 yuan, soybeans rose by more than half a yuan, and soybean cake rose by 2 jiao.

<p>Matches, Candles, and Soap: Yesterday, the prices of daily necessities all soared. This was because the United States froze funds in the Far East, and people's minds suddenly became tense. Sellers tried their best to buy, and those who held the goods held up the prices. Most of them watched the situation and sold off, and only a few sold, which made the price even tighter. The purchase price of matches increased sharply. The market price rose sharply by more than 50 yuan compared to before. The Beautiful brand was 770 yuan per box, and the Phoenix brand was 760 yuan per box. The price of soap also increased slightly.

<h3>The US and UK Freeze Chinese and Japanese Funds, Strengthening the Legal Tender Foundation. All Sectors Should Not Believe Rumors and Should Seek Calm. Legitimate Foreign Exchange Needs Will Still Be Supplied.</h3>
<p>US President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he would freeze Japanese funds. The United Kingdom also adopted parallel action. Therefore, financial circles generally believe that this move by the United States is tantamount to severing relations with Japan and using the most effective economic sanctions to resist Japanese aggression. This move is absolutely beneficial to China. After four years of Japanese aggression against China, its economy is on the verge of exhaustion and it is suffering from an inability to support itself. Now that it has suffered this major blow, the consequences are even more unimaginable. As for the issue of the United States simultaneously freezing Chinese funds, according to financial circles, Shanghai is the financial center of the Far East, but it has already become an occupied area. If only Japanese funds are frozen, then the huge amount of foreign exchange in Shanghai will still fall into the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, China and Japan must be frozen simultaneously in order to take effect. Therefore, the US government, at China's request, took this action at the same time. Moreover, the foreign exchange of China that has been frozen, if approved by the government, will still be used for legitimate purposes, but the specific measures have not yet been announced.</p>
<p>Implement Restrictions and Stop All Payments</p>
<p>Since the US government announced the freezing of funds, American banks in this city have taken emergency measures to restrict foreign exchange of Japanese banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, and Chinese banks deposited in American banks, and all payments in US dollars have been suspended. All Chinese and Japanese banks wishing to withdraw foreign exchange must follow the following two temporary measures: (1) Chinese and Japanese banks and merchants withdrawing foreign exchange will only be paid with New York drafts by American banks. These drafts must be cashed in New York, and whether or not they can be cashed in New York will be determined by the US Treasury Department. (2) If Chinese and Japanese banks or merchants wish to withdraw US dollar deposits, they will not be paid in US dollars, but will be settled at market prices and paid in legal tender. As for British banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank, they have also taken parallel actions with American banks regarding US dollar deposits. All foreign exchange of depositors from China and Japan will be paid with London drafts or converted at market prices and paid in legal tender in order to prevent the escape of frozen funds.</p>
<p>Japanese Commerce Suffers a Heavy Blow</p>
<p>Japan's main exports to the United States are silk products, totaling 50,000 yen per year. Its main exports to the United States are cotton textiles, totaling 400 million yen per year. The two total 900 million yen. The value of goods imported from the United Kingdom and the United States to Japan's Northeast Four Provinces and Kwantung is 50% of Japan's total imports. In the future, this trade will be completely cut off.</p>
<p>No Impact on China</p>
<p>However, some people are deeply concerned that after Chinese funds are frozen at the same time, China's import and export trade with the United States, the British Empire, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies may be interrupted. Financial circles believe that the US freezing of Chinese funds is based on China's application, and this move is entirely to prevent Japan from arbitraging foreign exchange and is a fundamental solution. Moreover, before President Roosevelt issued the freeze order, the US Treasury Department had issued various licenses to take various precautionary measures after the commercial interruption between Hawaii and the Philippines and China and Japan. In addition, it also authorized a special license to fourteen well-known banks to handle import and export trade between any part of China (except the Northeast Four Provinces) and the United States, the British Empire, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, it is firmly believed that this move by the United States will not affect China's foreign commercial relations, and the country that will be severely hit will be Japan alone.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Supply Adopts a License System</p>
<p>According to government bank sources yesterday, the measures taken by the British and American governments to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds were proposed to the US government by Mr. Fox, the American member of the Chinese Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, after returning to Hong Kong from Shanghai to discuss with other members. The British government also took the same steps to show its cooperation with the United States in response. It was found that Zhang Tao originally advocated maintaining the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai, but in the future, in order to protect legitimate trade between China, Britain, and the United States, foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries, and a "license system" will be adopted to work closely with British and American commercial banks. All those requesting the supply of foreign exchange must state their reasons and may purchase it after approval, otherwise they will be rejected. This move is extremely unfavorable to Japanese speculators.</p>
<p>Consolidate Currency Confidence and Eliminate Conspiracies</p>
<p>Regarding the fluctuations in the Shanghai financial market caused by the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by the United Kingdom and the United States, the entire Chinese finance remains as stable as ever. Moreover, the freezing of Chinese funds is in response to the request of Chairman Chiang, and after its implementation, it will make the credit of China's legal tender more consolidated. The import of necessities in the free area can still be applied for commercial exchange listed by the Central and Communications Banks, and legitimate merchants in Shanghai who need foreign exchange will also be supplied as much as possible. Therefore, it is hoped that all industries will remain calm and not worry excessively, and do not be confused by market rumors. Maintaining the legitimate business of legitimate merchants is the established policy of the Chinese government. In the future, the Shanghai foreign exchange market will be stable for a long time, so that conspirators cannot arbitrage foreign exchange and speculators can no longer use their old tricks. This kind of freezing measure makes the future of China's monetary system and finance very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Gas Surcharge Will Be Reduced Starting Next Month. The Surcharge Will Be Reduced by Ninety Percent. Reasonable Company Management Benefits the Public.</h3>
<p>According to the information office of the Public Works Department, the Shanghai Gas Company's request to reduce the temporary gas surcharge from 250% to 160% has been discussed at a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee of this bureau and approved by the board of directors at its regular meeting. It is approved to be implemented from August 1 of this year and can be reconsidered at any time before the end of October of this year. During the period of rising prices, the company is able to reduce the surcharge partly because of the early completion of the bent-necked distiller. This measure allows most of the cheaper coal to be carbonized, thus reducing the cost of manufacturing gas. Furthermore, the increase in the use of this coal allows the company to increase the amount of coke available for sale, thereby increasing revenue. In addition, the income from the sale of surplus products also increases the company's income due to higher prices.</p>
<h3>Goods Detained on Guangdong Ship Belong to the Dutch Government. The Japanese Have Confirmed and Entrusted the Dutch Consul to Return Them to the Original Owner. Goods Detained on the Mueller Ship Are Being Unloaded One After Another.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at a press conference hosted by the Japanese side yesterday (the 25th), Major Matsuda, the representative of Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, the spokesperson of the Japanese Army, stated that the Japanese authorities had learned that the 900 tons of goods unloaded from the Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship were not the property of the Chongqing Central Government as previously suspected, but belonged to the Dutch government. Therefore, all the goods were entrusted to Mr. Bowden, the Dutch Consul General in Shanghai, yesterday to be returned to the original owner.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Caused by Failure to Inspect</p>
<p>The Dutch government has admitted that the goods were detained due to the Dutch side's failure to inspect them by the Japanese authorities before being shipped out on British ships. These goods were cotton cloth and textile machines, packed in 739 boxes, totaling approximately 900 tons. They were returned unconditionally yesterday. The Guangdong ship was detained on July 10, and the goods on board were moved by the Japanese authorities to the godown for inspection. The ship sailed out last Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Approximately 600 Tons of Goods Detained on the Mueller Ship</p>
<p>The spokesperson also stated that the goods on board the British ship Haida Mueller were unloaded yesterday and placed in the custody of the British authorities here. The ship carried approximately 500 to 600 tons of machinery and cotton cloth, which were being transported to Yangon and Calcutta.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Believes They Belong to Chongqing</p>
<p>However, the Japanese side learned that these goods were actually being transported to Chongqing and decided to unload all the goods and hand them over to the Mueller Company for safekeeping, pending negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities. The export of goods on the ship should have been inspected by the Japanese authorities in advance. The unloading work began yesterday morning and is expected to be completed today (the 26th) or tomorrow (the 27th). It is reported that the Haida Mueller was originally berthed at Pujiang buoys 14 and 15, and was moved to the Company He Xiang Wharf yesterday so that the coolies hired by the Japanese side could unload the goods.</p>
<p>British Embassy Issues Statement</p>
<p>The British Embassy in this city issued a statement yesterday regarding the detention of the Guangdong ship and the Haida Mueller ship by the Japanese military, stating that the news published in the newspapers here regarding the goods on board the Guangdong ship and the Haida Mueller ship, which were unloaded at the request of the Japanese authorities, also included the statements of the Japanese naval spokesperson. The facts are now announced as follows: The textile machinery on board the Guangdong ship belonged to the Dutch East Indies authorities. The British Embassy did not know that it was forced to be unloaded. The Dutch government has declared that it should be responsible for the detention of the machinery because the machinery had not been inspected by the Japanese authorities before being loaded on the British merchant ship. However, this statement is not necessary in fact, because the goods in question have gone through customs formalities and there is no need to inspect them again. The opposition of the Japanese military police was raised after the goods in question had gone through customs formalities and started loading on the Guangdong ship. The detention of the Guangdong ship and the unloading of the goods on board occurred after the Dutch East Indies authorities had fully explained the ownership of the goods to the Japanese authorities. Regarding the Haida Mueller ship, the Japanese military police opposed the transportation of the goods to Hong Kong, Saigon, and Calcutta after all the goods had gone through customs formalities and completed loading. The goods were consigned to the Chinese in the above three places, and did not belong to Chongqing, and there was no need for the Japanese authorities to inspect them. The goods in question have been temporarily unloaded by the shipowner at the Gonghexiang Wharf until a definite decision is made.</p>
<h3>French Ship Schedules No Longer Announced. Shanghai-Vietnam Shipping Not Affected.</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the French Shipping Company has recently kept the schedules of its ships secret and will no longer announce them in advance due to the sudden tightening of the situation in the Far East and due to environmental needs. However, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping will not be affected by the severity of the situation. It is reported that the company's Da Danan ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Saigon, Little Luzon, and other places tomorrow (the 28th), and the Los ship is expected to transport rice from Vietnam to Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Monopolized by Japan</h3>
<p>Although there have been plans by the Chinese to organize a company to participate in shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, it has been rumored for a long time and has not been realized. At present, the only passenger ship operating between Shanghai and Ningbo is the Japanese-owned Mingfeng Maru. The ship travels between Shanghai and Ningbo on no fixed schedule. However, because the tonnage is very small, it cannot carry many passengers and goods. Each time it carries more than 100 passengers and the ticket price is quite high. The goods carried are only food and medicine needed by their army, and no other commercial goods are carried. Passengers are also limited to carrying 40 kilograms of luggage, so it is not beneficial to actual freight.</p>
<h3>Da Xin Restaurant Strike</h3>
<p>The Da Xin Restaurant, which is attached to the Da Xin Company on Nanjing Road, originally had a tea room and a Cantonese cuisine department with dozens of employees. Recently, due to harsh treatment and opposition to the forced withdrawal of tips and customer rewards, they suddenly announced a strike yesterday. The labor unrest is still deadlocked.</p>
<h3>Tram Monthly and Seasonal Tickets Increase in Price Next Month. Increase by 50 Percent</h3>
<p>Since the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession implemented price increases on the 14th of this month, half a month has passed. The price of monthly and seasonal tickets has increased by 50% compared to the previous price. The first-class adult monthly ticket is 32 yuan per ticket, the children under 16 years old is 16 yuan per ticket. If it is common to use two concessions, the adult is 48 yuan per ticket, and the children is 24 yuan per ticket. The company has now started selling.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Shipping Regulations Have No Clear Provisions. Japan Mail Society Still Sells Tickets to Japan. The Other Two Companies Have Temporarily Suspended Sales.</h3>
<p>Japanese Embassy Claims Unaware of Behind-the-Scenes Reasons</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Pao reported that the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference here yesterday (the 26th) that Shanghai is unaware of the new regulations and schedules of the Japanese shipping companies operating shipping between Shanghai and Japan and North China, so he has inquired and clarified them. At present, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (Japan Mail Society) still sells tickets to Japan, but the Toa Kaiun Kaisha (East Asia Shipping Company) does not. The Dalian Steamship Company also does not sell tickets to Japan, but tickets to Qingdao are still issued. All Japanese shipping branch offices in Shanghai are acting in accordance with the orders of their domestic head offices. As for the behind-the-scenes reasons for implementing these new regulations, the Japanese Embassy and the naval spokesperson are unaware. According to the statement, in order to end the Sino-Japanese War, shipping schedules should of course be changed due to military needs. The two matters of the Japanese side summoning reserve soldiers in Shanghai and the new shipping regulations are not related.</p>

<h3>Bean and Rice Association Announced Yesterday That Food Reserves Are Sufficient. Total Rice Reserves in the City Reach More Than 2.1 Million Bags, Enough to Meet Needs Before August, and There Is No Worry of Scarcity in the Future.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association's 121st rice reserve survey, which began last Friday, was finally completed yesterday due to continuous heavy rain, which made progress difficult. According to the report, the total rice reserves in Chinese and foreign godowns in this period (from last Thursday to this Thursday) reached 1,274,552 bags, an increase of 74,755 bags compared to the previous period. However, the rice and grain shipped from home and abroad in the past two days were not included in the survey because they were still being unloaded and entered the godown.</p>
<p>Rice Reserves in Each Godown Have Doubled Compared to the Previous Period</p>
<p>The rice reserve investigation in this period includes Pudong, Hongkou, and the Central District, covering approximately 90 Chinese and foreign rice godowns. Among them, Roosevelt, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, Gonghexiang, Shuntai, Longmao Company, China Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, China, and Communications Bank godowns are the most significant, with an average of 20,000 bags of rice stored in each godown. Last year on this day, there were only more than 70 rice godowns in the city, and the rice reserves were only between 400,000 and 500,000 bags. The Bean and Rice Association has now submitted the survey results to the authorities of the two concessions and the seven rice industry groups for record.</p>
<p>Sufficient Grain Reserves in the City for August</p>
<p>It is reported that the above-mentioned rice reserves only belong to the Chinese and foreign godowns. However, the retail sales and storage of rice numbers, residents' advance purchases and storage, and the food groups that have ordered and transported them to Shanghai are all included in this survey. According to accurate estimates, the grain reserves have now exceeded 800,000 bags. Therefore, the entire food reserves in the city have now surged to more than 2.1 million bags. At present, the daily rice consumption in the city is still about 10,000 piculs, which has not increased compared to the past. The grain reserves in the city are sufficient for the needs of the city's residents for more than eight months, and the domestic and foreign sources are still continuing. There is no shortage of food in the future.</p>
<p>Effective Measures Strictly Enforced</p>
<p>The rice industry groups in this city were previously ordered by the authorities of the two concessions to quickly ban various illegal transactions in the rice market: (1) All spot transactions are allowed in the same industry, and no empty buying and selling are allowed. (2) Those participating in market transactions are strictly prohibited from reselling and raising prices for profit. (3) Once the grain transaction is completed, both the buyer and seller must issue a receipt for verification. It is learned that the two authorities will continue to strictly enforce these effective measures, and all rice merchants must abide by the regulations in the market and must not act contrary to them. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the established regulations.</p>

<p>Dance Girl Readers Donate Flower Powder Fees</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ying from Yongqing Lane, Ai'er Road, wrote a letter saying, "I lost my education in my childhood, and I work as a dancer when I grew up. Under the lights and wine, I deeply feel the pain of lacking knowledge. However, I like to read newspapers and regard myself as one of the loyal readers of the real report. I read it every day, which enriches my experience. Recently, your newspaper has set up a scholarship for readers to benefit the poor and bless the society. I admire it very much. Now I will save 10 yuan from my flower powder expenses. I hope you will not laugh at it. I think there are no less than thousands of dancing sisters in the city. If they can all realize this and take this into consideration, a huge number can be raised. I hope your newspaper will work hard to advocate and promote its realization."</p>
<h3>Airmail Service to Southeastern Africa Resumes</h3>
<p>The British Overseas Airways Corporation's flights to southeastern Africa and the United Kingdom have resumed, and airmail to southeastern Africa and the United Kingdom via the British Overseas Airways Corporation will be accepted by the post office as usual from today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Response After the Freezing of Funds. All Estimates Seem Premature.</h3>
<p>US President Roosevelt issued an order yesterday morning to freeze Japanese assets in the United States, and the British government immediately followed suit, freezing Japanese funds within the British Empire. The result has brought a large part of world commerce to a standstill. As soon as the US President announced the freeze, he immediately issued various licenses to prevent the interruption of trade between Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan and China, and granted special licenses to fourteen well-known banks, allowing them to assist merchants engaged in import and export trade in any part of China (except the Northeast Four Provinces) and the American Republics, British territories, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch Indies.</p>
<p>The business community in this city had expected a freeze order to be issued for more than a day. Now that it has been realized, the Shanghai exchange market suddenly saw a surge in the purchase of US dollars, causing the exchange rate to tighten. Exchange market speculators had long positions of approximately US$3 million and short positions of US$2 million. From this, it can be seen that the short positions are tight and they have to try their best to cover, regardless of the exchange rate. Because the banks in this city can no longer cover US dollars in New York, they have stopped spot and futures trading of US dollars, only settling long positions and not providing assistance to short positions.</p>
<p>The black market, which sees the exchange market as a shift, has very little spot trading, and the futures trading is huge. Both the spot and futures prices have risen higher than the closing price of the previous day. The price of yarn has also become firmer, because everyone expects it to be difficult to import raw cotton in the future. As of yesterday afternoon, it was still unknown what special regulations would apply to Shanghai under the freeze measures and how importers of rice, cotton, and other items would prove that their requests were legitimate. However, there is no doubt that American banks will grant permission to merchants and importers who can prove that their activities do not conflict with American interests.</p>
<p>As for what degree of consideration the US authorities will give to the personal needs of those who have deposits in US banks, it is also unknown. At present, it is also too early to estimate the far-reaching impact of the US and British freeze orders on the Far East and the situation that will occur in the Pacific. However, there is no doubt that Japan's economic system is already heavily burdened by the increasing consumption of the Sino-Japanese War, and will be stretched even further in the future. It should rein in its horses before it is too late to avoid a tragedy.</p>
<p>As for the speculative activities in the black market and the US dollar market in this city, they will naturally disappear in the future. There were no transactions in the stock market yesterday, so it is not possible to know exactly how Shanghai merchants will react to the freeze order. However, according to analysts, since Shanghai's floating capital has lost its outlet in the future, it is expected to flood into the stock market again, so stock prices are expected to rise tomorrow. It seems that there is no imminent danger of a Pacific war breaking out. The business community and speculators also hold this view. It is unpredictable, and judging from the situation in other markets, it seems that no one expects the United States and Japan to go to war in the short term. (Wei Zhong)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Association Banquet Flags with the Letter V Hanging Everywhere</h3>
<p>The Shanghai British Royal Air Force Association held a luncheon at its clubhouse at 30 Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday to entertain American dignitaries in this city. Those who attended included President Hallen, former President Sir Sassoon, Alexander, the head of the information office of the British Embassy, and George, the British Consul General. Those who attended from the American side included American Consul General Lockhart, and Lawton, Beal, and Smith. Flags with the letter V were hung everywhere in the venue, which was inspiring. The Shanghai V-letter movement was officially discovered in public places, starting with the luncheon of the Royal Air Force Association. Hallen first gave a speech during the meeting, expressing his welcome to the American guests, because the United States has doubled its aircraft production capacity in the past six months, which has enabled the Royal Air Force to establish its dominant position in controlling the sky. We are welcoming the coming of victory, and the future of democracy is limitless. Lockhart then gave an informal reply, praising the greatness of American military production and saying that if anyone evades responsibility, there will be no satisfactory results today.</p>
<h3>Illegal Transactions in the Coal Market Should Be Banned Urgently</h3>
<p>In the Coal Industry Association market at 405 Tianjin Road, unscrupulous coal merchants were active in the market, causing the entire coal market to become loose and tight, and the price of flue-cured coal was fluctuating. The industry association has repeatedly issued notices strictly prohibiting various illegal transactions by the industry in the market. The reporter recently learned from people familiar with the coal market that those speculative coal merchants are still secretly active in the market, taking the opportunity to buy up various spot and futures goods at low prices, and then selling them at high prices on the spot in order to obtain illegal profits. This affects the entire coal market and is not insignificant. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions responsible for suppressing prices will ban them as soon as possible. The coal industry association is watching from the sidelines and does not ask, which is difficult to shirk the blame.</p>
<h3>Two Sailing Ships Sailing from Zhenhai to Dinghai Were Robbed. Women Were Forced to Be Humiliated.</h3>
<p>Recently, sailing ships sailing from Zhen to Dinghai often encounter pirates. On the 21st of this month, two sailing ships carrying more than 50 passengers sailed from Daqi Tou, Zhenhai to Dinghai Zhoushan. When sailing to the ocean in the middle of the journey, they suddenly encountered two pirate ships, which intercepted the sailing ships and carried out searches. All the legal tender clothes and items carried by the passengers were robbed, and even a few liters of broad beans were robbed. Two women and a 12-year-old girl were dragged to the pirate ship and forcibly humiliated before the ship was released. It was found that these passengers were all transferred from Yong to Dinghai to Shanghai. When they arrived in Zhoushan, the girl who was humiliated by the pirates was still walking unsteadily and suffered a lot.</p>

<p>Shipping Company Embezzles Passenger Cargo. Responsible Person Avoids Contact. Apprehended by Police.</p>
<p>Zhu Shenzhi, manager of Dingsheng Oil Company at 282 Fuzhou Road, entrusted Chongli Forwarding Company of Hele Lane, Zhejiang Road, to transport goods such as cloth and white sugar worth 18,000 yuan to Changshu on May 7 this year. Yunli then handed it over to Xinji Shipping Company at 329 Shandong Road for consignment on the 27th. Unexpectedly, the goods neither arrived in Changshu nor were returned to Zhu Shenzhi. The responsible personnel of the two companies avoided contact. Zhu knew he had been embezzled without a doubt, so he reported to the Central Police Station and requested investigation. It was not until yesterday that Detective Chen Yonggui and Detective Wang Shusheng of the Chinese Detective Team apprehended Zhou Sanyuan, a native of Jiangbei and manager of Xinji (resident at 19 Zhenxiu Lane, Kaifeng Road), Gu Yansheng, a native of Changshu and assistant manager (resident at 24 Jisi Feier Apartment), and Wang Jimin, a clerk of Yunli, all three from Changshu, at the Dadong Tea House on Jiujiang Road and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the defendants in this case had committed many similar incidents, so he requested that they be detained for further investigation. Lawyers Gu Zeting, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang defended them. Judge Fu then ordered them to be detained for rescheduling the trial in one week. It is learned that Luo Genji, Xue Jianbai, and others have also reported to the police station that they had been embezzled of lace worth 7,500 yuan.</p>

<h3>誰是你的摯友</h3>
<p>Who is Your Best Friend?</p>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>I can assert that every child has many friends. Among these friends, there are varying degrees of closeness, and surely there is a friend who is the closest and dearest to you, whom I would call your best friend. Little friends believe that a best friend is someone who often gives you your favorite things to eat or play with. It's someone with whom you share the same interests. For instance, you both like to bounce a ball, so you become best friends from bouncing a ball together every day. It's someone with whom you often eat, drink, and play, and through familiarity, you become best friends. But if you never return things to them, they won't willingly associate with you; if you are unable to bounce a ball with them for several days due to an event or illness, then they will gradually drift away from you; if your parents don't give you money to eat and drink with your best friend, they won't let you freeload all the time. These kinds of friends, in ordinary times, certainly have very engaging conversations, eating, drinking, and playing together, and getting along happily. But if you ever disagree or have a conflict of interest, you'll each go your own way. Some will even hate each other for it. Or if you have extreme difficulties that you can't resolve, they won't care about your problems. Is this kind of person your best friend?</p>
<p>Then who is your best friend? Perhaps it's the person you consider the most annoying! They often point out your faults, urge you to improve, care about your studies and behavior. When you make a mistake, they feel bad for you. When you have difficulties, they help you resolve them. On ordinary days, they may not necessarily hang out with you and your friends, but they are always paying attention to your actions, hoping that you strive to improve.</p>
<p>Children are young and inexperienced and can't clearly recognize who their best friend is. They think that the person they often play with or the person who once helped them, regardless of their character or academic performance, is their best friend. After getting along for too long, your behavior also gets tainted. I have personally seen many children learn vulgar language and do indecent things because of bad friendships. Joining gangs, fighting…it's just endless. Children, think carefully. Not recognizing clearly and being careless in making friends is so dangerous!</p>
<p>Finally, I advise all children! A best friend isn't a drinking and eating friend, a playing friend, or an interests-based friend. It's someone who can advise you and hopes that you improve. That's your true best friend. As for interests-based friends, as long as they are well-behaved and also excellent children, then it's fine to make several of them. But you must be clear about who your best friend is. After recognizing them clearly, you should often be close to them and accept their good intentions.</p>
<h3>晏平仲的機警</h3>
<p>Yan Pingzhong's Wit</p>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn period, there was a high official in the State of Qi, named Yan Pingzhong, who was only three feet tall and dressed very plainly, but his talent was superior to others.</p>
<p>One day, the ruler of Qi sent him as an envoy to the State of Chu to improve diplomatic relations. As usual, when a minister of one state is sent to another to improve diplomatic relations, the etiquette of receiving the envoy should be extremely grand. However, the King of Chu knew that he was a short man, so he deliberately made a joke of him. The royal palace clearly had a main gate, but the King of Chu specially opened a small door next to the main gate. When Yan Pingzhong arrived at the palace gate, the guide deliberately led him through the small door. His intention was none other than to mock Yan Pingzhong for being a short man, who didn't need to use the main gate. He then said to the guide, "This is a dog hole! I am going to the State of Chu, not entering the palace of a dog country. Why should I go through this dog hole?" The guide didn't expect him to scold him so harshly, so he had to report to the King of Chu, who reopened the main gate and invited him in.</p>
<p>The King of Chu knew about this matter, of course, and was very ashamed. After a while, Pingzhong walked in, and the King of Chu lazily gave Pingzhong a greeting and immediately said, "Could it be that there are no people in your country?" Yan Pingzhong calmly replied, "In the city of Linzi, Qi, people rub shoulders in the streets, and if everyone sweats at once, it can form rain. How can you say there are no people?" The King of Chu said, "Then why did you send someone like you to our dignified State of Chu?" Pingzhong replied, "Our country has rules for sending envoys. Generally, when sending envoys to large countries, we always send great men! When sending envoys to small countries, we send people like me!" The King of Chu wanted to ridicule him, but unexpectedly, he was laughed at instead, and he had to endure it in his heart.</p>
<p>Later, the King of Chu held a banquet for Pingzhong. Suddenly, a prisoner was brought up from the steps. The King of Chu deliberately asked those around him, "What crime did this person commit?" Those around him replied, "This is a person from the State of Qi who committed theft." Thereupon, the King of Chu looked at Yan Pingzhong mockingly and said, "Ah! Is it true that people from the State of Qi are accustomed to being robbers?" Yan Pingzhong said calmly, "The same orange tree bears oranges when it's in the south of the Huai River, but when it's moved to the north of the Huai River, it bears trifoliate oranges. Just now, a criminal didn't commit robbery in our country, but as soon as he came to your country, he engaged in robbery and theft. Speaking of which, I should thank your country's good education!"</p>
<p>The King of Chu was very ashamed and used the courtesy for distinguished guests to deal with him!</p>
<h3>吃凉粉</h3>
<p>Eating Jelly</p>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>It was an afternoon in the heat of summer, and the weather was as hot as if someone had a fever. The younger brother kept whining about wanting to eat popsicles. Mom said, "Popsicles are too cold. Why don't you buy some agar-agar, and we'll make some jelly to try, okay?"</p>
<p>The younger brother happily said, "Okay!" After saying that, he went to buy agar-agar.</p>
<p>They started making the jelly: First, they took one tael of agar-agar and soaked it in cold water to wash it clean. Then, they took four ounces of white sugar and dissolved it in two bowls of boiling water, and boiled it in a pot. When the sugar had dissolved, they added the agar-agar and stirred it until the agar-agar had dissolved and mixed with the water into a gelatinous state. Then, they filtered out any impurities from the sugar and agar-agar, and waited for it to cool halfway, then they added three or four spoons of fruit syrup and continued to let it cool. After an hour, it had congealed into a transparent, creamy, cool soup.</p>
<p>So, they shared it and tasted it. The younger brother ate and said, "This jelly is sweet, fragrant, and refreshing. It's really delicious!"</p>
<p>Mom said, "Jelly is certainly delicious, but don't forget what the raw materials for making jelly are." The younger brother said, "Isn't it the good agar-agar I bought?"</p>
<p>Mom said, "That's right. Well, how is agar-agar made?" "…"</p>
<p>Mom also said, "Agar-agar is a domestic food. It is made from a type of red seaweed called 'stone flower vegetables.' It is boiled into a solution, filtered to decolorize it, evaporated to concentrate it, and then left to cool and congeal. It is then cut into thin strips and dried, and it becomes the agar-agar sold in the market. Agar-agar can not only be used to make jelly, but it is also a dish that we often eat!"</p>
<h3>打針</h3>
<p>Getting a Shot</p>
<p>— Jin Jian</p>
<p>When Ah Hui's father saw the following news in the newspaper: "Cholera is in danger of spreading in the city. An epidemic has occurred in the slum areas of the concession, with many deaths. Therefore, every resident must be vaccinated against the epidemic. After vaccination, one can be immune to the epidemic for four months. In the following weeks, cholera is expected to expand and spread, so those who have not been vaccinated must be vaccinated immediately." After that, he went to invite a familiar doctor to prepare vaccinations for everyone in the family.</p>
<p>"Dad, why can cholera kill people?" Ah Hui asked about the two unfamiliar words "cholera."</p>
<p>"Cholera is a disease that is especially easy to get in the summer, and it can be contagious, so this kind of epidemic disease is very scary. If you get this disease, you will vomit, have diarrhea, and develop a fever. It's even more dangerous within a day or two, and soon the patient will die. That's because cholera is caused by a cholera germ that gets into our mouths from flies and other unclean and uncooked vegetables. These germs are very small and alive. Once they enter the body, they invade the bloodstream and produce a kind of poison that destroys the blood. This person can't live."</p>
<p>"Then why do we need to get a shot?" Ah Hui felt that getting a shot was very painful. He had gotten a shot last year, and it didn't seem to do any good, so he brought up this question and asked his father.</p>
<p>"Getting a vaccination can prevent the occurrence of epidemic diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever, which means you won't get this kind of dangerous disease anymore."</p>
<p>But what his father answered wasn't really what he meant, so he asked again, "Why can a vaccination prevent epidemic diseases?"</p>
<p>"Do you know how the glue-like stuff in the vaccination is made?" His father asked him back. Ah Hui shook his head, indicating that he didn't know.</p>
<p>His father then continued, "This stuff is called a vaccine. There are many kinds of them, and each kind of vaccine can prevent a certain disease. For example, to prevent cholera, you only need to get a cholera vaccine. Like to prevent smallpox, you have to get a cowpox vaccination. Cowpox is also a kind of vaccine. The manufacture of this kind of vaccine took a lot of research by medical scientists to succeed. First, cholera germs are planted in the bodies of strong animals, like cows, horses, rabbits, etc. When the germs come into contact with the animal's body, they naturally invade the animal's blood as well, but the animal's resistance is strong, not afraid of the poison released by the germs, and instead goes to destroy them, which can reduce the degree of toxicity, or kill the germs. Then the doctor takes it down, and after some sterilization, refines it into various vaccines. Injecting this kind of vaccine into the human body can increase the body's ability to kill bacteria, so you don't have to worry about getting this kind of disease again."</p>
<p>One day, the doctor who gave vaccinations really came. Ah Hui willingly let the doctor pierce his tender skin with the long, sharp needle. He only felt a little swelling and pain, because he already understood what the effects of getting a vaccination were, unlike last year. They took turns getting shots one by one. Finally, it was the old nanny's turn, but she cleared her throat and said, "I've already had this cholera vomiting and diarrhea disease before. I don't need to get another shot this year." She insisted on not getting the shot, and only a small amount of the vaccine was injected. This aroused Ah Hui's surprise again. "What's the reason for this?" he asked the doctor.</p>
<p>"Because she has had cholera, her body has produced an antitoxin that resists cholera germs, which can kill these germs, and there is even some of this antitoxin left over in her body, so she can get fewer injections of the vaccine. If this kind of germ is found in her body a second time, the remaining antitoxin can immediately kill them, and she won't get this kind of disease again."</p>
<h3>兒童圖書館參觀記</h3>
<p>A Visit to the Children's Library</p>
<p>— Zhang Xixian, Ziqiang Elementary School</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I saw a piece of news about the opening of the Children's Library in the education news column of the Shen Bao. At that time, I was very happy, and I planned to go to the library with my older brother for a visit. Yesterday after dinner, my older brother and I set off from Putuo Road, turned onto Gordon Road, and went to the library on Dahua Road.</p>
<p>It took us more than half an hour to walk to the library. There were many people at the entrance, pouring in like a tide. We also squeezed into the crowd and went in.</p>
<p>The facilities in the library were indeed very perfect. The bookshelves were against the walls, and the books inside were arranged very neatly. Underneath was a row of benches, and the children were all sitting and reading books, with happy smiles on their faces, but the order was also very good. On the walls hung two maps, one was a map of China's current situation, and the other was a map of the world's current situation. There were many photos hanging on the walls, including a posthumous portrait of Madame Chen, the mother of Ji'an Zhou, and photos of the board of directors. There were photos of great men, including Sun Zhongshan, Yue Fei, Confucius, Washington, Edison, Lincoln, etc., to whom we paid our respects. The staff members of the library were all very kind and approachable, with smiling faces. I chose a few books to read, such as biographies of Columbus and Baden-Powell, and rhetoric for writing. The content was indeed very good and very suitable for the psychology of us children. After a while, I looked up and saw that the long and short hands on the clock were pointing in the middle of six and twelve, so I came out with the people and went home with my older brother.</p>
<h3>在人多的地方為什麼很易頭痛？（下）</h3>
<p>Why is it Easy to Get a Headache in Crowded Places? (Part 2)</p>
<p>— Ah Mao</p>
<p>Some people think that because we exhale carbon dioxide and need oxygen, when many people gather in a room, the amount of carbon dioxide slowly increases and there isn't enough oxygen, which causes headaches. This statement is also incorrect. Carbon dioxide itself is not poisonous, and people won't get sick from inhaling carbon dioxide. But according to experience, in crowded places, if the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the temperature in the room will definitely increase as well, which is harmful to our health. Therefore, ventilation machines in public places still use carbon dioxide as a standard to adjust the air.</p>
<p>In short, the reason why it is easy to get a headache in crowded places is because the temperature around us is too high, which prevents our body from releasing excess heat. It's the same reason why you get heatstroke from walking under the hot sun in the summer, and why we get headaches from sitting in a room with the windows closed and a very hot stove in the winter.

<h3>It is rumored that Wu Suqiu will appear on the silver screen</h3>
<p>— Bei Shi</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu is a talented figure in the Peking opera world. Because of her beautiful appearance and good social skills, she caused a sensation and captivated many opera lovers when she first performed at the Xinsheng Stage last year. At that time, the Guolian Film Company had planned to invite her to shoot a "Peking Opera Film," but it was abandoned due to unmet conditions.</p>
<p>Jin Xinmin of Minhua is very fond of Peking opera. He often feels that if reasonable improvements are made, the future of Peking opera will not be difficult to develop and expand. Fei Mu also shares the same view as Jin Xinmin. Therefore, the recently completed "Song of Ancient China" was filmed using cinematic techniques. Now, the Meicheng Factory stipulates that Jin Xing will spend one and a half months shooting a play starting from August 1st, and then Minhua will also spend one and a half months shooting a play. In this way, there will be no conflict in terms of time and space. After receiving this suggestion, the Minhua authorities, after consultation, felt that it would be too late to shoot a newly compiled script. Therefore, they planned to shoot a "Peking Opera Film" like "Song of Ancient China." Then they thought of Wu Suqiu, who caused a sensation last year.</p>
<p>However, there are many problems. If she is invited alone from Beiping to Shanghai to film, not only will there be no supporting actors, but also, according to the custom of the opera world, all travel expenses and accommodation expenses after arriving in Shanghai will be borne by the company, which is not cost-effective. Therefore, the best hope is that Wu Suqiu can come to Shanghai to perform, so that negotiations can be carried out conveniently, and the burden will be reduced a lot.</p>
<h3>A glimpse of Cangzhou Bookstore</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiu</p>
<p>This year, the business of Guangyu Bookstore has seen significant development. The Zhongchang branch of Dongfang Bookstore has not been open for long, and now the new-style Cangzhou Bookstore has followed closely.</p>
<p>Cangzhou Bookstore is located in Cangzhou Hotel. The place is quiet and the transportation is convenient. It is undoubtedly the most ideal bookstore. Now, "Qinglong File" has early, day, and night sessions, simultaneously refreshing the audience's ears and eyes with a brand-new posture and strong lineup. The author visited the day session one day.</p>
<p>The bookstore is arranged in a south-facing rectangular living room. The seats are uniform white canvas chairs. The area is not large, but the audience sits extremely comfortably. Facing a green lawn, surrounded by a wide corridor, the long windows are open, the cool breeze is blowing, the air is fresh, and the light is harmonious, so sitting for a while does not feel stuffy or tired.</p>
<p>The day session is entirely storytelling with stringed instruments. Presumably, because of the location, there are particularly many female listeners, so there is no Pinghua show. The first act, "Zhu Zhao's Love Affair of Laughter and Tears," needs no introduction. Everyone has already heard it so well on the radio and in bookstores, and they know it very clearly. Jiang Yuequan in the second act has not been famous for long, so his articulation and performance are still lacking in sophistication. He must work with Zhou Yuquan to achieve the wonderful effect of a perfect match. Performing alone now will inevitably suffer a great discount. Xue Xiaoqing in the third act, after splitting up with Shen Jian'an, changed to being an upper hand. His narration and expressions cannot get rid of the "side flower" (lower hand) nature. What is worth noting is his current lower hand, Pang Xueqing. Pang studied under Xue Xiaoqing and has a naturally good voice. His pronunciation is clear and his singing is full of twists and turns, with a promising blue-out-of-blue appearance. A few years ago, he and Ni Pingqian teamed up, and the "Ni Pang Team" was hailed as a rising star and became famous for a while. After the breakup, they became destitute and could not return to their former glory. Now almost no one mentions his name anymore. Such is the fate of entertainers, often like this, which is a sigh!</p>
<p>Overall, the layout and lineup of Cangzhou Bookstore have undergone careful consideration and deserve the praise of being exquisite. Therefore, since its opening, the results have been satisfactory, and the audience has never declined, which has to be said to be a gratifying thing in Shanghai's entertainment industry.</p>

<p>When Chaplin was looking for a beautiful woman for the film "Modern Times," she was selling dances at San Goldwyn and was discovered by him. Later, she became Chaplin's wife. Her first divorce was from a marriage arranged by her mother when she was three years old. The second time, she divorced Edward James. Her marriage to Chaplin was her third. Mr. and Mrs. Chaplin have both been divorced three times. They are really a perfect match. There were rumors of a rift between them last year. But she recently won the honor of new dance queen. Born in Whitestone, Long Island, she is five feet four inches tall and weighs 110 pounds. She will soon co-star in a new film with James Stewart.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Qiong Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow to the Bandits</p>
<p>When Liu Yinying returned home this time; thinking that his aunt had already passed away, it was like a dream, and he felt a little sad. So, he and Xu Jing went to the Guanwang Temple on Shijiao Peak to visit the wise old monk to thank him for his help and to discuss the burial. Because Liu Yinying's uncle had been buried in Weifeng Mountain after his death, he was of course buried in the same cave now. The wise old monk chose an auspicious day for them and carried out the matter. All the earthworkers were handled by the wise old monk, which saved Liu Yinying a lot of energy. Liu Yinying thanked him a few words and retreated. Because Xu Jing's shoulder injury had not healed, Liu Yinying told him to go to bed early. The two horses were kept in the back garden for future use. From then on, Liu Yinying stayed on the mountain to observe the funeral, and Xu Jing recuperated his shoulder injury. For several days in a row, there was silence and nothing happened. Xu Jing's heart was always thinking about the past bloody battles in Dai County and Ningwu, lamenting the martyrdom of Wang Yongtai and Zhou Yuji for the country, and feeling that he really owed them too much. Therefore, when he chatted with Liu Yinying, he was saddened by the precarious state of the country. True patriots were preparing for battle, and the autumn of hearing the rooster crowing and rising to dance. General Zhou sacrificed himself to become a hero, and he was worthy of the country. His family was loyal and righteous, and he would naturally be recorded in history. He himself was unwilling to give up, and he had to continue to work hard, find another place to establish meritorious service, and lay the groundwork for repaying the country in the future. Liu Yinying naturally agreed with his statement, because now that his aunt was dead, he was alone and had nothing to miss. He could go anywhere in the world. Xu Jing also remembered that when Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei separated at Li Xinzhuang in Qi County before, they had gone to Wu Sangui, the general of Shanhaiguan, to join the army. He wondered what their situation was now. It was rumored that Wu Sangui was also a hero of the time, holding the tiger talisman and shouldering the important task of the frontier. At this time of turmoil in the world and the collapse of the building, he would definitely take heroic actions, issue orders to recruit talents, and make plans to stabilize the world in order to save his people from fire and water. Since he had nowhere to settle for the time being, why not go there and choose a tree to perch on, and also give long-separated friends the opportunity to meet again? So, he revealed this idea to Liu Yinying, hoping to invite Liu Yinying to take a trip outside the pass with him. (126)</p>
<h3>Talking about Zheng Bingru's Dramatic Art</h3>
<p>— Wu Sou</p>
<p>I have always liked watching dramas, but I am a layman in this field. The other night, I went to the Golden Theater to watch Zheng Bingru's masterpiece, "Peach Blossom." In my opinion, the whole drama is very tight. And Zheng Ling's pronunciation and singing can be described as round and smooth, and her posture and stage steps are all excellent. With the addition of Mr. Yu Zhenfei's Zhang Daonan, the peony and green leaves are all beautiful. Last year, Zheng Ling performed at the Xinsheng. When I watched her "Imperial Stele Pavilion," I saw the danger of her slipping on the muddy road when she went to the pavilion to avoid the rain, and the fearful posture when she was tried and punished in the three halls. Also, when she closed the kiln door in Fenhe Bay and listened to her husband outside the kiln telling about his past hardships, her sobbing and crying were rarely matched. Since then, whenever female actors come to Shanghai to perform the above-mentioned plays, I always go to see them one by one. However, those with outstanding reputations have not performed as beautifully as her. In addition, I don't know if Zheng Ling's masterpiece "Live Capture of Wang Kui" can be performed to satisfy the people of Shanghai and see her again. With this talent, if she studies further and performs in line with the true meaning of the plot, I am afraid that no female actor can compete with her.</p>
