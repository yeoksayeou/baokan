<p>社評</p>
<h3>本報讀者助學運動　——致謝各界兼勉諸同學——</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金之剏設，實始於上月十三日，至咋日核准全部名額之日止歷時凡三十有八日，於此極短促之期間中、辱承讀者寄予熱烈同情，或事輸將，或加督敎，凡醵資五萬四千餘金，各校學生領取表格者二千餘入，正式申請者八百五十六人，實際獲得資助者三百四十有七人，本報同人，分任訪問審查之事，而以最後取捨之決定，公之於特設之委員會。茲値學期開始之際，欣見入選諸生，得遂向學之願。譬之植樹。此其丕基，本報同人於奔走之餘彌覺興奮，忘其勞苦，願抒所懷，兼以勗勉諸生。</p>
<p>吾人自敎官之最高精義言之敎育者何？曰，民族生活經騐之傳遞與創造是也，故敎育實爲國家社會最基本建設工作之一，凡屬國民。均有享受敎育之權利，而國家亦應使人民有受敎育之義務。吾國倡導普及敎育凡數十年，而猶未及卓著成效者，實限於財力。格於地城。未臻理想之境地但就社會方面言。亦未盡協助推動之功能。夫今日之靑年即爲將來社會之一員，將　一有用之材以造福於人羣歟？抑以學養未足竟無裨於公衆歟？是則胥視此時所受之敎育以爲斷。當此世變日亟，生計維艱，淸寒子弟　困於財力環境，未能普遍獲償求學之願。竊吾人服務社會，應爲社會培養優秀份子，若任令淸苦子弟蹉跎歲月，不予以進修之機會，實爲社會無　補償之損失，每一念及寗能恝然！</p>
<p>此一年來。本報迭獲淸寒學子來書，陳述處境之艱困與夫向學之悃忱，所附學業成績，又均斐然可觀。自小學中學以上而專科大學，莫不具備；且已有人學數年而將功虧一簣者。本報素以服務社會，發揚文化爲職志，凡涉公衆福利，輒効棉薄，未敢後人，茲既同情於失學靑年之處境，自不得不以此問題，向本報廣大之讀者，作誠摯之呼籲，期以社會最嚴切之事件，訴諸社會，共謀解決之道。</p>
<p>社會之之烈同情，策勵督敎，誠有令同人鼓舞興奮而不能自已者。自助學金開始以還、讀者踴躍輸將，普遍及於各個階層，工商領袖，銀錢同業致送鉅額捐款，固無論矣，而市肆學徒，書販報童以及侍役女傭，亦莫不爭先恐後，致送其得來不易之金錢。以踐此爲善最樂之一念，馴至感動緇素，亦以唪經所入，慷慨助學，至於節省車資烟捲與夫天眞無瑕之兒童，罄其所有以從事者，允靡日無之。其最値得珍視者，爲一隱名氏之老人，獨捐鉅款，自承年近耳順，景人桑楡，小本經商，能力薄弱，願効棉薄，以作涓滴之助、如下學期尚在人世，營業不致驟變，仍當繼續佽助云云，同人於接晤老人之際，深爲敬佩，竊以此種眞誠偉大之義舉，實足以代表社會最高貴之正義感，憑此一念，何事不舉？吾人並已深切體會，社會間儘有無限盡之同情意識，潛伏於廣大之羣衆間，苟能善爲倡導推動，必可熱烈發揚。共成一有價値之事業，茲者此廣大同情心，已由本報與讀者共同獲得之矣。</p>
<p>同人懍於職責之綦重，承乏調查工作，訪詢不厭其詳，報告務期翔實，庶幾讀者熱心捐助之金錢，母作絲毫浪費，而淸寒向學之士，果成績優異，品行純謹，必使沾得實益，秉此信念，努力以赴，自始至終，未敢或渝。至申請諸生之家庭情况，亦承推誠相與，坦白見告、綜覈所述，的有數端：諸生中亦有家境向極優裕者，乃以轉徙流亡，遽告貧困，其恃薪給自膽者，或因失所棲止，饔飧不繼，又若父兄遠道服役，戔戔所入，難維個入生計，焉有餘力，以供子弟膏火？至於寡婦孤兒，窮愁煎迫，益處悲慘之境地、凡此種種，同人聞見所及，根觸萬端，益認助學之舉，不容稍緩。</p>
<p>審核之事，固力求學行之平均發展。而申請學生之父兄職業與夫全家人口。尤未敢忽視，蓋生活程度日高。八口之家，四人就學。其收入總數與支出比例，實有應予精密研究者在，同人逐件研討，再三審核。期無絲毫之疑問而後始簽具最後之意見。委員會諸先生俱敎育界知名之士，對各組工作，垂詢殷切，不厭周密，凡可予申請諸生以機會者，允從寬核准·其情緒之熱烈，與本報讀者捐輸之善念，同其旨趣。委員會先後凡集議三次，諸先生酷暑蒞止，歷時甚久。熱忱毅力，極堪欽佩，此本報與讀者所應鄭重致謝者也。</p>
<p>更有爲入選諸生告者。助學非救濟事業也，助學金之聚集蓋基於同情心而來，具有鼓勵及爲社會育才之價値。入選諸生，獲此資助，不應視爲解除經濟上暫時之困厄，應視爲無上之榮譽，抑若學校之榮譽獎金者然。吾人一生最寶貴之歷程，不外人助，自助與助人三者。今諸生既獲人助，應如何敦品勵學。努力前進而求自助之道，自助能力充沛。即應有以助人，諸生此日之受助於社會者，他年必千百倍還之於社會。竊願以本報讀者助學金爲其嚆矢，而有千百助學金繼其後焉，諸生勉乎哉！</p>

<h3>印度詩聖　泰戈爾訪問的回憶（五）</h3>
<p>— 徐寶謙</p>
<p>附錄（泰氏游華游俄經過）</p>
<p>民國二十三年，泰氏應中國友人之請，來華遊歷。四月十二日泰氏對上海學生團體演講，他說：「千餘年前，印度曾遺她親善使節到中國，後來這種往來雖然中斷，但我們曾能找出若干痕跡。我希望中印兩國能恢復這種光榮的友誼」</p>
<p>四月二十三日，泰氏到北京赴車站歡迎的有蔣夢麟和美人李佳白等。二十八日，泰氏在地壇對學生千餘人演說。五月初赴淸華大學演講。</p>
<p>他說：「我們生長在這個大時代，應當慶賀自己。你們中國靑年，應首先認識自己的文化。有人說，中國文化唯實的，是唯物的。我並不相信這句話。你們固有的社會組織處處表現出不自私的精神。你們的民族並不崇拜金踐，也不崇拜武力。我不信你們的文化是唯物的。我遊歷中國各地，看見土地培養的很肥美，一切日用的器具，都表現藝術的美；這些都衣現精神文化。我以爲你們能當物質却不爲物質所累，這正你們偉太的地方。從你們固有的文明，不難看出物質文明與精神文明的區別現在東西兩洋的文化主流，快要合流了，你們應當趕緊作你們的貢獻」。</p>
<p>泰氏的講詞，當時會引起中外人士的批許。其中措覺最巧妙的，要算淸華敎授王崑山氏，他說：「泰氏誠然是一位東方的先知，他們講詞，從神秘的意識中發出，似乎是無懈可擊。不過，仔細分析後，我們覺得他所要答的，是一個非常實際的問題，就是：中國文化，究有何種供獻？泰氏說：中國文化，處處表現着美精神，所以不是唯物的。但是，我們要問，難道別的民族，不是怎樣麼？難道中國文化的貢獻，祇此一點麼？泰氏以爲中國文化，已經勝渦了完全與進步間的矛盾。是的，我們也顧意作爲此看，不過，我們只能希望着作如此看法」。</p>
<p>五月廿五日，尚吳賢堂李佳白爲泰氏舉行歡送會，席上泰氏說明他的宗敎信仰如下：「我到中國後，有人問我，是吾相信上帝。對於這個問題，我覺得頗難回答。不過，世界旣有如此美麗，我總不能相信它是機械的產品。花呀，樹呀，烏呀，對我都俱活潑的使命。死後的情形怎樣，雖然我們無從知道，但是，宇宙間有一位偉大而慈悲的靈，那是我所感覺而深信不疑的。至於我們，稱呼這位大靈，那是一個次要的問題」。泰氏又說：對於各敎的信條及儀式，並不甚感興趣。他自己的家庭，曾從事於印度敎的改革。不過，他自己的宗敎觀，完全從自然所給予的美感中得來。他在自然之美的背後，發現了大靈的存在」。</p>
<p>泰氏旣然負起了國際文化的使命，對於蘇俄的新試騐，自然急欲前往一觀。一九二六年，蘇俄政府正式邀請泰氏，泰氏行抵維也納，因病中途折回，後來泰氏赴加拿大演講，本擬於一九二九年由加回國時，坐西伯利亞火車赴俄，又因病中止。</p>
<p>一九三〇年後，泰氏多年積願始告實現，於九月十一日抵莫斯科，到站歡迎者有蘇聯文藝界和文化界要人若干。泰氏在莫京逗留共兩星期，除與文藝界接談外，特別注意共產少年團，農民俱樂部，大學學生等團體。此外，泰氏且曾舉行個人畫展。</p>
<p>泰氏迸俄的宗旨，在第一决招待會席上，即有所說明：將我的目的，是來貴國學習你們怎樣處置世界文化問題的經騐。近代的文化，使人類違反自然增加了人類無窮的痛苦。現在你們對於人類文化問題，作大規模的解決，其成功與失敗，將來歷史自有定論，我不願在此作無理的批評。不過，你們的魄心，是値得佩服的。我的敎育理想，是在創造自由的人格，發展人類的創造力。我相信你們的理想，與我無異</p>
<p>九月十七日，泰氏舉行個人畫展，大受蘇俄藝術家的讚人。據泰氏自述：他不是一個畫家，他的繪畫，出於一時衝動。不過，據蘇俄藝術家的鑑賞，泰氏的畫，自成一派作風，生動有力，爲藝術界開一新紀元。</p>
<p>九月二十四日，即泰氏離俄的前夕，泰氏在工團總會會所致離別詞：「印度民眾的生活，敎育，經濟，衛生種種，都非常落後，而且各敎之間，常演武劇。因爲這個原故，我雖年老，仍不辭勞苦，到實國來參觀。我在居留期內，看見你們各種偉大事業，覺得非常佩服。你們的進步，可說是一秤神跡」。</p>
<p>二十五日，泰氏臨行之前，告訴眞理報訪員說：「你們的努力，大可欽佩。不過，你們排除異己的政策，却不敢贊同。因爲，你們最後的目標，也是爲全人類謀幸福，但是，全體人類的意見，決不能盡同。須知寃仇宜解不宜結。今日你仇恨對方，明日對方就會乘機報復，使你們傾覆的」（完）</p>

<h3>美作家赫明威夫婦　暢遊山區防綫（三）</h3>
<p>我們在朝上又行了五小時路程，于是向下游去的旅程告一段落。我們離開龍光旅館已有二十四小時，雨勢未止，離開前錢尚有二天路程。在中國是沒有什麼馬奇諾防綫或曼奴海防綫的。這裏有綿亘的山脈。以高山作爲屛蔽，用機槍即可守禦，不必架設重砲。</p>
<p>急進的攻勢此地是不可能的，因在狹隘的山徑中機械化部隊無法運用。不過日軍可用飛機，華方則付缺如。在叢山中你看前綫形勢，只是一座山頭，巍偉靜穆地雄踞于蒼穹之下。</p>
<p>此地戰區大小有如比利時，約有人口三千萬。駐在此地的兵有兩軍，約計十五萬人。前綫與司令部的交通全靠軍用電話，其距離總是在一天的路程之外。</p>
<p>艱苦卓絕</p>
<p>中國軍隊不能請假，因爲此地僅有五百哩長的一條火車路，汽車汽油都缺，兵士就是想回家，也是無路可尋。所以軍隊駐在這裏有長達二年的，軍隊必要訓練自己的生活。每一部隊都有操塲，運動塲，敎室，閱覽室，和兵舍。司令部與軍官訓練營常在與後方接近的村中。</p>
<p>中國軍隊有很驚人的軍事敎育。在每一决接觸後，由前錢調回若干任務已畢的軍官和低級將士，送至訓練營學校去研究一月至三月。等他們回到部隊後，就可以敎練普通兵士。故軍隊中常常探討實際經騐，改正自己缺點。這樣說來，在村中有白石的尾子，許多服裝漂究的年靑軍人都在那裏硏究軍事科學了，其實不然，司令部與學校是用竹籬和泥磚造成，非常簡單，都由兵士自己動手建造。</p>
<p>軍隊中房屋與塲地的清潔，管理完善，爲我們來華後所僅見。軍隊在設備方面的缺點都想由訓練與組織來補救。訓練採取普魯士式，注重嚴格與實效，結果就是造成五十萬人的軍隊，脚上連皮鞋也沒有穿，但對于怎樣作戰，却有充分知識。軍隊薪給在政府服務人員中算是最小的，其實這是在中國任何機關中薪水最小。一個上校，每月薪金只有法幣一百五十元。依美金計算，只合七元二角五分。但在重慶買一雙皮鞋就要二百元，米價比戰前亦漲七倍。普通兵士每月賺法幣四元五角（美金二角五分）另外還有一些米貼。米貼的台美金八角，拿了這些錢，他還是不能吃飽。據說一個搬東西的苦力每月比一個上校的進賬要好二倍。軍隊薪給低微的制度，以及害病與受傷者缺乏必需的食物，是中國軍隊中的二大不幸。</p>
<p>熱誠招待</p>
<p>我們在司令部下馬後，即見歡迎我們的英文標語。紅色字母下面劃着綫條，分別貼在警衛處，兵舍和司令部泥墻上。標語上大書：「歡迎主持正義與和平的代表。」「民主陣錢國家聯合起來。作戰至最後勝利爲止。」這種標語由政治部工作人員擬定後印貼。有一决他們特從鄰村跑來打　我們將赴何處，他們可以預先趕去張貼標語。</p>
<p>我們拂刷了面上的雨滴，含笑鞠躬，感謝這種竭誠的招待，總司令戴了白手套以示禮節隆重，向我們回禮不迭。風吹入屋子，吹　沒有玻璃的窗子中。我們坐在靠　一盆熊熊的炭爐旁，暗地烘乾鞋子和小腿，司令和我們在閑。</p>
<p>通宵括風，睡着似乎不冷，但明天朝晨，天朗氣淸，可以望見遠山起伏。我們騎馬上高崗。舌人馬君恰騎在我後面。馬君身材瑣小，戴了一副嫌大的玳瑁邊眼鏡，胃口甚好，曾得二個美國學位，但並無軍隊經騐。他現在在韶關政治部工作。</p>
<p>「馬光生，」我指了前面燒焦的山說，「他們爲什麼要把這山上的樹都燒掉？」「他們要趕掉山上的老虎，」馬君說。「你看，老虎要吃某數種植物的細根和草類，如其把樹木燒掉了，牠們要覺得飢餓，就要跑開了。」</p>
<p>經過九小時的騎馬，沒有食物和水吃，我覺得十分疲倦，但中國人却不感疲乏，他們能默然接受任何變故：飢餓，疲勞，寒冷，乾喝，苦痛與危險。他們是世界上最堅韌的民族。我們在一村中下馬，這裏也是一個團部的司令部。司令部房屋由火磚砌成，街道都是泥土小徑，廢物與汚穢小徑滿街都是，陰溝是沒有的。</p>
<p>我們跟着一位軍官騎馬到操塲，檢閱一營兵士，這些兵士原先木是農人與苦工，在未　入軍隊前，他們連一個如手電筒般複雜的東西都沒有拿過。如其單獨看來，或在山中分散的　小隊看來，他們可憐有如孤兒，襤褸好比乞丐。但　此地嚴正的組合中，配備有　　，機關槍，目動步槍，手　彈；看來就是堅固的經騐豐富的　隊。現在他們開始操練，由軍曹　出尖聲口令。村中老人靜靜地看着，站在田旁頗有自得之色。戰爭發動時，其他農　救死扶傷，用竹榻掮了傷者經過崎嶇不平的山路，以至後方醫院中。中途沒有水飲，沒有裏傷所，如其　人不願掮扛，那就沒有傷兵了，都要死亡的！</p>
<p>「今夜我們要演戲，」那軍官說。華軍在操塲上燃了燄火，有一千二百人坐在又硬又冷的泥土上，等戲劇開演。在竹製的戲台上掛了一面藍布幕，他們費了一個半鐘點裝置一盞煤氣燈。突然燈光亮了，再慢慢暗淡下來，總算配到　　　的光度。兩個兵士把布　　　，戲劇開始，劇名「羣鬼」。　有精彩，慕落，一千二百兵士掌聲電動，紐約上演一著名戲劇，亦沒有這種熱烈情緒。政治部每隔一星期爲兵士上演一劇。</p>

<p>昨洋米市况續見徘徊下降、早市承前日收市之轉機、投機客囤頗有隨市吸收、不獨皮球繼續活躍、即內地鄕莊本客各戶均有問津、市面似有轉振之模樣、乃市價一振、即有浮戶吐出、且因傳說尚有各路洋米二十多萬可到、又以洋米有外滙供給、今後可以隨時成交辦運、新交易已經成議外、並傳有直接洽定、人心頓虛、市價即在賣氣旺盛中趨落、收市價又比前日小去半元至一二元不等、小絞現米小至一百二十二三元、英華司一百五十一元、又路貨一百五十元、敏黨路貨傳有中關貨售同等價格、又二號暹　英華司開一百四十二元半、成交共計不到五百噸、現貨的有一萬五千包、米市已連跌數朝、惟各米店經售之工部局米仍爲一百二十四元、未見改動、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米仍以到貨身骨較潮、貨主售心仍鬆、致兼疲檔、本鄕去路懈淡、售價　降兀外、開南港早晚稻百五十一元百四十九元、無錫原包白粳特別百五十一二元、中關百四十六七元、宿决百四十二三元、浦東新粳並見帶軟、開中關百五十五六元、糯米則以市貨有限、且時屆秋令、應用漸廣、銷塲轉爽、故雖他貨續疲、仍獨能站住、呈平定之局、開香港白元特別百三十元、决至百二十五六元、糯茶百十七元、次至百十四元、國糯以貨稀胃香頗屬俏色、開百三十三四元、</p>
<h3>粉市續告平軟</h3>
<p>昨洋粉續告平軟、雖銷路尚有、市面不脫盤旋、金龍粉開盤三十三元五角、即軟至三十三元三角、砲台粉三十四元七角半至六角及香蕉粉三十四元、比上日略疲五分至一角、成交併計二萬四五千包、福新麩皮開出三十三元五角、小麥沉寂無市、</p>

<p>食油昨市生豆油因黃豆價跌、及靑島略有來貨、暗盤已轉鬆動、惟菜油及棉子油則受投機商之拉提、仍見略升一二元、計售開大有廠淸油一千担、　菜油近千担、日華廠菜油二千餘擔、立　廠及大生廠菜油各五十桶、吉田廠菜油二百桶、（價詳市價欄）</p>

<h3>煤炭　煤球一月三變</h3>
<p>平民負担大受威脅</p>
<p>煤球行情、週一自法公董局宜佈評高價格、廠盤由三百零八元、加高爲三百二十元、本街門莊零售、每担亦由十六元六角、漲至十七元二角、一月三變、平民負担、大受威脅、</p>
<h3>紗花　足證投機勢力超越現實　期紗行市支配現紗</h3>
<p>金雙馬期紗下跌亦甚鉅</p>
<p>紗市　平、但趨勢仍在飄盪不定中、此因人心不一、且連升多日、引起一部份獲利者吐出、以致籌碼轉鬆、空頭又復活躍，至於多頭以爲原棉難鬆、廠方成本有關、加之日紗價昂、雙馬廠單較爲廉宜、吸收之額、亦不放棄、所以多空兩方爭持益覺劇烈也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百〇一元、低價爲一千六百六十九元、午後停市、目前紗市因人心太佳、恐起反應、不過就原料方面着想、不得大墜、但以上海紗市塲、本來視現紗之盈虛爲消息、近則現紗勢力日漸式微、期紗買賣反可以支配現紗、以實就虛、此花投機狂盛之時期中、恒有此種現象、今日有棉紗八百件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開人氣尙佳、首盤價為一千六百九十五元、少頃漲至一千七百〇一元、繼以多頭肚出、回鬆至一千六百八十六元、惟價格稍廉、成進者尚不缺乏、在此一千六百八十七八元之間、曾見一度盤旋、但取引所價格、因多頭出檔、市盤下降、於是稍受影響、下墜至一千六百六十九元、迨至收盤、取引所價回昂、隨隨升上至一千六百八十六元、不過現紗交易不及上日之旺、又復軟弱至一千六百七十五元收盤、査半日問成交統計六千七百二十包、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一五〇廈門　二〇</p>
<p>同行六、五五〇統計六、七二〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市況、趨勢反常、忽起劇烈之暴瀉、當上午開出雖美棉續堅、然未能引爲多方之憑籍、故廠單開後即降、乃使期紗人心忐忑、且木月份叉爲最後一天交易買方收貨未見踴躍多數爭相出籠、八月期開盤爲一四九六元、即軋低十元、雖中途因空方扒補、亦以本月期爲最後一天之買賣、回高至一五〇六元、但旋又下墮、迨九月期開出突以現紗又起謠言、雖其中不無捕風捉影之因素、但未能節制人心騷動、是以廠單直降而下、引起期紗饗應、大戶逢高出籠、空頭跟踪加碼、一時檯面爲賣戶所壟斷、賣氣瀰漫、近速期慘遭打擊、幾成直降、午收八月期爲一四九四元、軋低十二元、九月期爲一五八二元、下跌十三元、十月期爲一五九六元、低落十五元、前市成交一萬〇九百五十包、午後由徘徊而再跌、脚地軟弱無力、多方沮喪之下、潛力殊覺减退、故空方乘間左右、市價繼續下跌、結果八月期爲一四八九元收市、跌落十七元、九月期爲一五七〇元五角軋低二十四元五角、十月期爲一五八二元五角、劇跌二十八元五角之多、收盤相差九十三元半、全日共成交一萬七千八百七十包、比上日减少三千二百五十包、茲將開收高低價錄左（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<p>附市塲通告、八月期紗定於廿九日交割、市塲停止集會、又自二十一日起、各月期棉紗買賣、暫改訂時間規定如後、</p>
<p>上午　十月期開二收各十分鐘</p>

<p>下午　九月期開收各十分鐘</p>
<p>十月期開收各二十分鍊</p>
<p>十一月期開收各三十分鐘</p>
<h3>花紗背馳愈顯</h3>
<p>現棉情況、依然上挺、紗市雖回疲、與棉市毫無相關、如斯情形、造成紗與棉脫離聯繫性、所以價格一味增高、以致消費者對於細絨無從下手、成交减色不少、印棉成交較厚、價格尚無變化、做開現貨錄後、</p>

<p>紐約棉市、堅穩活潑、緣棉產狀况不佳、及天氣報告惡劣而漲、結果期現貨均比上日漲十至十三磅音不等、</p>
<h3>證券　外債仍堅</h3>
<p>內債昨又趨軟</p>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市復又趨軟、買戶終未見踴躍、賣戶則仍繼續有現貨塞出、趨勢倘上漲三五角、賣戶即見熱鬧、所以稍有漲風、即邋挫折之故在此、昨日上午怡泰買進十六號新華及協興元賣出、檯面供過於求、比隔日小二角、午後三十八號恒康及信孚號買進、而新華再有買出、四十一號積記及聯和均有賣出、市價仍屬無力、結果除丁種與前毫無漲跌外、餘均小一角半至二角半、成交全日祇七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>糖市　比戰前僅漲起五倍　車戶以為有機可投</h3>
<p>近來不絕向糖市進攻</p>
<p>食糖連日上漲甚銳、其原因大都爲囤戶視爲目標所致、査事變前市價如粗白僅二十四五元、以現市比擬僅五倍之譜、故囤戶視爲尚未漲足、不絕吸收、價乃步升不已、昨公司劃貨二四粗白因週三下午無市、僅上午市面、八月底期一百二十一元·二十三元·二十三元四角、九月十日期一百二十五元三角·二十五元·二十五元四角、均升一元二角、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白七月份到貨一百二十三元·二十四元二角、下午二十五元·二十七元半、升四元、六月份到一百二十一元半·二十三</p>

<h3>南北貨　湘蓮獻新</h3>
<p>湘蓮首水新貨已見、計到本湖蓮十件、當爲香港幫如數辦去、價達五百元、較冷氣貨高起二十元、亦新高價也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠盤仍昂　粗布所漲獨鉅</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢依然堅挺、雖取引所已見盤小、市價影響甚微、乃因廠盤仍昂之故、怡和粗布廠盤各檔較上日價開高每疋一元二角半至二元半、祗十</p>
<p>磅照市不加、因之十一磅售價較軟、餘檔每疋漲五角之譜、粗斜漲五角至一元、細布細斜色布價均平定、本街成交各布六百餘件、以染廠及同業納意較濃、浙東溫台等幫辦粗布細布斜紋等一百餘件、粵　南洋幫辦漂染布卡其粗布斜紋等八百餘　、</p>

<h3>平準會訂新匯率後　已規定結售辦法</h3>
<p>指定中外銀行九家辦理　並派英委來滬監督實施</p>
<p>自平凖基金委員會於十八日起、公佈新滙率、准許若干家銀行、供給對　合法貿易者結售後、法幣價値、即告上漲、中外商人、咸蒙其利、於是人心甚爲振奮、咸認該會此舉措、在政治上及經濟上、均有重大意義、以英美徇中國政府之請、同時凍結中國資金之目的、為援助中國政府統制滙兌，管理貿易、防止資金落入日方之手、俾得消滅投機行動、今上述目的、業已發軔、見於行動、且頗著成效矣、</p>
<p>加派英委來滬工作</p>
<p>平凖基金會為欲明瞭上海之實際情形、俾經常採取對策以應付滬市外滙問題起見、除派現猶在滬之　幫辦泰萊博士繼續硏究、搜集各項有關資料外、並將另派新任之　委霍爾巴樞（E.L.Hall　Patch）於短期內來滬、霍氏乃英國遠東財政參贊、因原任　委羅傑士調任香港政府經濟顧問、乃被請繼任斯職、此行來滬、所負使命者五、（一）與上海友邦銀行及國家銀行當局聯絡指示平凖會之決定對策、（二）研究英美凍結資金令之成效、並儘量使之减少漏罅、（三）監督上海指定銀行按平準會新定匯率供給外滙之實施、（四）分析上海進出口貿易狀况、防止出口商之自由拋售外滙及杜絕進口商非必需品之請結外滙、（五）調查上海及淪陷區之中國法幣狀况及物價之漲落、竭力减少滙市變動對物價之影響、</p>
<p>九家銀行奉命辦理</p>
<p>大中社記者昨午特訪中國銀行某高級職員、叩詢一切、承詳爲解釋、據稱、此决率平凖基金委員會命、特准按照新滙率美元五元三四三七五、英鎊三便士一八七五、供給對華合法進口貿易者外滙之銀行、共祗九家、爲（一）英商滙豐·麥加利·有利·（二）美商花旗·大通·（三）華商中央·中國·交通·農民、至列入美國一般照會第五十五號內、指定獲有特權經營外匯業務之其他九銀行、如（一）美商友邦·　　·（一）蘇聯·莫斯科·國民·（三）英賽通濟隆·老沙遜·新沙遜·沙遜偎公司·（四）荷蘭安達·荷蘭則並不在內、</p>
<p>限於金鎊集團區域</p>
<p>此項外匯之結售、一、必需吻合一般照會第五十八號各項之規定、（一）須爲善意的進口貿易、其申請額必需與進口値相等、（二）不得爲中國以外封鎖國家或其人民及東三省人民所經營或委托代營之貿易、（三）不得爲有關中國以外封鎖國家或其人民及東三省人民利益之貿易、二、進口貨必須來自金鎊集團區域、三、必需爲一九三九年七月四日中國海關當局公佈及其後修訂增加之禁運條例所未列入之進口貨、</p>
<p>先予結匯補請核准</p>
<p>四、凡申請者、必需提出證明文件、如提單發票、及運輸單據、證明並非投機行爲、五、上述九銀行接受申請後、經審査合格、即可准予先行結滙、但　保留二星期、在此一期內、由各該行駐港辦事處或代理處向平準會駐港辦事處提出三聯申請書、然後呈請重慶平準會核准、如該會認爲遠反禁運條例、則應將所結得之外滙、再行出售、</p>
<p>米煤問題尙須請示</p>
<p>至上海租界區域所需要之米煤、是否可以依照新匯率結售、據稱、（一）以中國海關當局所頒佈之禁運條例、旣尚未到滬、內容作如何規定、不得而知、（二）進口貨既規定必須來自金鎊集團區域者、始得照新匯率結售、則今上海所進口之米煤、並非完全來自金鎊集團區域、如越南即屬明證、自不能按照此項有利匯率、結得外匯、此一問題尙有待請示、外間謂已可按照新匯率供給說、並非事實、</p>
<p>禁運物品分十二類</p>
<p>關於一九三九年七月四日中國海關當局公布之禁運條例、其後雖屢有修正、但仍以最初公布者爲根據、據大中社記者探悉、所列禁運貨物共爲十二類一百六十號、以限於篇幅、茲僅記其類名於下、（一）棉花及棉織物、（二）亞豚·苧麻·大麻·黃麻·及其製造品、（三）羊毛及其製造品、（四）絲及其製造品、（五）食物及飲料及植物類藥草、（六）烟草、（七）蠟燭·肥皂·脂肪·蠟·膠水及松香、（八）書籍、地圖及紙、（九）生熟動物物質及其製造品（如皮革·猪毛·馬　·象牙等均在內、）（十）木材·木料·竹·籐·草·及其製造品、（十一）磁器·搪磁·玻璃等物、（十二）雜類（如琥珀·珊瑚·龜甲及製造品·古董·古玩·漆器·金屬物裝飾品·扇子·留聲機·首飾等等、）</p>
<p>正式佈告即可發表</p>
<p>泰晤士報云、平準基金委員會關於協助民主國家貿易商人獲得有利匯率之命令、尚在靜候詳細消息、據匯豐銀行職員稱、「關於此事之正式佈告、今明二日內、或可發表、」重慶政府禁止進口貨物表、第一次發表於一九三九年七月、嗣後曾經數次修改、一般現正等候最近一次之修正、銀錢業職員暗示、目下購買外匯之困難、即使係合法輸入、亦將繼續至香港或重慶發表詳細情形時為止、</p>
<p>目前交易為數甚少</p>
<p>字林西報云、昨日（十九日）本埠進口商人、仍不知如何爲合法貿易、但在大體上昨日之情形、與星期一（十八日）相較、並無多大變化、由英美及金鎊區域與荷印之進口貿易、均在平準基金委會所發表新章程範圍內、凡進口貿易、須經證明確係合法後、然後始能結售新匯率因此昨日（十九日）依照新匯率之交易、爲數甚少、另一事實、使合法進口貿易大受不便者、爲僅有少數人、已獲有違禁進口品之名單、此項名單載於一九三九年七月份英國商會雜誌第一百三十九頁上、</p>
<h3>西區積潦未退　公共交通梗阻</h3>
<p>日前豪雨連朝、更兼潮位較高、致低窪馬路、悉成澤國、咋日天氣陰晦、秋風中時挾細雨、迄下午稍露晴光、租界心臟區域、積水業已退盡、公共租界西區、如靜安寺路慕爾鳴路哈同路赫德路福煦路康腦脫路小沙渡路等段仍有積水、法租界方面、霞飛路水已退盡、有軌電車業已復駛、惟巨籟達路蒲石路亞爾培路北首等處、則仍一片汪洋、滬西極司非而路地豐路億定盤路大西路海格路等馬路、水勢初未稍退、允以地豐路水深及腰、預測一二日內、難以盡退、昨日十叫路紅牌駛往惇信路之公共汽車、亦因水阻暫停、僅白脾十四路依然行駛至地豐路、駛往安和寺路之二路公共汽車、則仍涉水維持交通、其他各路車輛、駛往滬西區者、均以靜安寺爲終點、</p>
<h3>營業稅原案已修改　併入房捐徵收</h3>
<p>改稱為營業房捐特加稅</p>
<p>手續紛繁一時不致實行</p>
<p>關於公共租界工部局擬徵收營業稅一案、工部局財政委員會、曾於十八日下午四時半、在工部局會議室開會覆議、聞對原案已有修正、將名稱改爲營業房捐特別附加稅、並決定將此項修正案、提出工部局會議、作</p>
<p>最後決定以此項稅收、實質上原爲一種營業收益稅、爲求合法起見、故將改爲房捐之一種、並加以明確規定、今後對於各種企業活動、　以相當限制、務使無法逃避捐稅、至於此項稅捐內容、據調査大致如下、新稅係根據營業房屋之估價額徵收、分爲兩級、A級各種事務所·商店·工塲·倉庫·碼頭·等、一般營業房屋、B級各種交易所、A級稅率、按房屋估價額</p>
<p>滿三千元者年徵八分、B級稅率、按房屋估價滿三千元者、年　一成五分、總額每年約可收入七百萬元、（其分數之方法與稅率、與現時法租界所徵收之營業稅大致相似）、此案一俟工部局下月三日休假期滿後、即可提出討論、惟此稅係初創、尚須經過種種手　、故其開徵之期、或將延至明年一月起實行之、</p>
<h3>日商受凍結令影響　絲市轉</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國凍結中日資金之結果、上海絲市情况已完全改觀　結令頒佈前、日人盡可能範　、不使非日人出口商獲得華中之絲，以圖自運至紐的銷售、但日人亟欲避免被凍結之危險、故寗願將生絲在本市售予其他商號、據本市日文報載、日方華中絲公司已接訓令、不復對美輸出生絲、但可隨意售予本市非日人出口商、故過去兩週內、日方會將大量華中生絲、售予上海中英美等出口商、聞　輪柯立芝總統號上週從本埠載絲不下六千包、運往美國、</p>
<h3>傳蘇嘉路雙橋　列車出軌</h3>
<p>路軌拆毀數十丈　乘客數十人受傷</p>
<p>昨據蘇州來人稱、前晚蘇嘉鐵路中段、又發生翻車事件、據悉、前日下午二時五十五分、由蘇州開赴嘉興之客車一列、於下午五時許、駛經嘉興以北王江涇以南之雙橋附近、不知該處路軌已被人拆毀數十丈、列車遂告出軌、機車一輛、翻入河浜、傳聞乘客受傷者、亦有數十人、現日方正在趕速修理中、</p>
<h3>滬越間法輪　增加運費</h3>
<p>增加一成半　客票不加價</p>
<p>大中社記者昨向法國航務公司探悉、該公司新增之滬越間雜貨運輸費價格如下、（一）自上海至海防每噸運輸費由港幣二十八元增至三十三元、（二）自上海至西貢每噸運輸費由港幣三十一元增至三十六元、計增加百分之十五、據該公司職員稱、上項新訂運費之實行期、需待本月廿三日倍那聖庭庇號及廿四日離埠之霞飛將軍號開出後、下班駛越之船隻實行、惟該公司由馬尼刺駛滬船隻之運輸費、業已於上週增加百分之二十、至該公司所屬各屬客票、則並不增價、又悉最近因滬越間貨運繁盛、故航運殊為發達、除　飛將軍號外、尙有三艘於月內繼續抵滬、（一）金第安輪廿四日抵埠、開庭號廿七日抵埠、感犬　南號廿九日抵埠、各輪均載有大批米煤、至駛越之輪隻所載貨物、以布匹為大　、</p>
<h3>國內郵資加價說　滬局未奉明令</h3>
<p>國內郵資已於去年一度增加、茲又有於九月一日起增加國內郵資之傳說、大通社記者昨晨向上海郵政管理局負責方面探悉、該局迄目前止、尚未奉到總局加價之通令、未便懸　、惟以近來物價上漲之程度推斷、增加郵資實屬合理之措施、無可非議、</p>
<h3>日發言人否認　美僑被扣作質</h3>
<p>旅美日僑多於旅日美僑</p>
<p>美僑已能來滬轉道回國</p>
<p>大陸報云、日大使館發言人崛氏昨日（十九日）午後招待新聞記者時聲稱、美　不致如外傳之被扣於日本作質、渠雖未接關於此事之正式情報、但路透社電已傳旅日美僑能來上海、旣有此一隙口、則「扣僑作質」之計劃、自不能存在、日本若有此舉、其本身所受打擊、較美國爲重、因放美日僑、遠較旅日美僑爲多也、就渠所知、日方從未實行禁止美僑由日來滬之任何限制、日方境內近所採行之「鬥戶關閉」政策、禁止未獲特許之外僑出入、並非報復美英之凍結命令、此項新辦法、考慮有時、而於八月十五日正式實施、</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>轟炸機的功績</h3>
<p>— 郭洪迪</p>
<p>「轟炸機的功績嗎？」你也許要憤槪痛恨地說，「殺人就是轟炸機的功績！血肉糢糊，斷肢折臂，殺人如蔴，城市爲墟，這就是轟炸機的功績！」</p>
<p>你的話固然不錯，但是，且慢，我所要說的是轟炸機的另外一種功績，轟炸機救人的功績。</p>
<p>是一九三五年的年底，夏威夷羣島的大火山洛亞山突然活躍起來，濃烟直噴，火熖冲天，數星期中，溶巖激流成河，大有向夏威夷的第二大埠海羅城奔流而來之勢。當時美國的火山專家夏加博士，隨侍在側，逐日注意火山的活動情形，溶巖的奔流方向，他注意到如果溶巖繼續東流，在兩星期中，海羅城的二萬居民，祗好放棄數千萬元的財產而逃命，不然就要葬身溶巖中了。</p>
<p>這時形勢十分緊張，要救海羅城的二萬居民並保全他們的生計，惟有設法使溶巖停流或轉向。在這千鈞一髮之際，夏加博士靈機一動，想出了惟一的辦法，就是請陸軍當局派轟炸機去炸火山口。</p>
<p>當局答應了，先派偵察機去觀察火山形勢，然後先投試騐彈，最後才由五架轟炸機，輪流向火山口投擲二十顆六百磅重的炸彈。於是溶巖爬行的速度逐漸减低，三十三小時後，溶巖完全停流了，三天後洛亞山的爆發也停止了。於是轟炸機救活了二萬居民的性命。</p>
<p>不但科學無罪，轟炸機也是無罪的呢！</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>白衣使者的前途</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>『我是宇宙中的俘虜。」</p>
<p>「要飯的比我還强。」</p>
<p>『死也不幹這白帽子的鬼事了。</p>
<p>『……」</p>
<p>一連串的咒詛，從白衣使者的口中發出來。</p>
<p>如果您是知道的，您就會亳無餘地的同情她，向她那每一句牢騷點頭。</p>
<p>是呀，南丁格兒是偉大的。她那『捨己』的精神，値得我們永遠的景佩！但她、永不會想到，此時此地的某一角，居然有『救救護士』的呼聲。</p>
<p>一點不誇張地，嫻是欽倒南丁格兒的一個；至少，這漿過的『白帽子』，這怪悅耳的『Nurse』，這『服務人羣』的口號，着實成了她迷戀的中心</p>
<p>她小鳥般地進入這『高級護士學校』，不，這在嫻也許是天堂。</p>
<p>她已迅速學會了做棉花球，撕膏布，舖病床，測體溫，計脈息。</p>
<p>她也會問病人『大小便幾次』？</p>
<p>繼續，她更會調黃油膏，依克度，點硼砂水，灌雙　水等了。</p>
<p>從六時到六時，從晨曦至晚霞，從厠所到門診部，她打發達兩條腿努力牠的前程。</p>
<p>『這是基本工作』！</p>
<p>她記得院長的話，她支持她的疲乏。雖然，她對那兩本護士必讀』和『小兒護病學』始終沒有開課有些焦急。</p>
<p>雖然還沒有上過課，但嫻的實際工作却已經進入『榮譽階級」了——她已經可以在病狀表」上寫Sleep　well報告了。這是院長的『提拔』</p>
<p>院長出診了，他帶着兩個挺美的學生，他獎勵她們塗上口紅——是的，這是『給病人一個愉快的印象』。</p>
<p>嫻被派在『單病房』了。院長對頭等病人是特別『巴結』的，他吩咐嫻『要好好的』。</p>
<p>「多漂亮的小姐，尊姓大名』？甚至撫着嫻的酒渦。</p>
<p>院長不接受嫻的抗議，他的意思，護士應該義務地接受病人的調笑——不，「給病人精神上的慰藉』。</p>
<p>嫻疑問：『這是不是南丁格兒「捨己」原則下的產物？』</p>
<p>過些時候，嫻也讀過兩章『藥物學』了。接着，她也被調到「配藥間』。</p>
<p>配藥是這樣：</p>
<p>蘇打粉加上紅色素是「服藥』，蒸溜水注人『安配』是『補針』。</p>
<p>『還有更好的』！院長將補藥補針換了病人的鈔票。但他的解釋是：『這是心理治療法，是最新的』。</p>
<p>『菲，我不必再告訴您院長和護士們丟臉的事，反正是護士必須「犧牲」，「捨己」，甚至犧牲到像夏姓一般』。</p>
<p>『不，我不承認護士是沒有前途的』。</p>
<p>『有，有！我的前途不是醫生的姨太太，就是永世的老處女！』</p>
<p>嫻的話相當嚴重，甚至她的態度也發揮意志作用了，我奇怪這隻小鳥會變作鷹一般的冷酷。</p>
<p>『您別奇怪我的變遷，「白帽子」就是一個魔圈，它會使活潑變成木呆，熱情變成死灰，天眞變成假冒！</p>
<p>『進去那天我是拉開嘴的，接着我是鎖上眉的，現在我是放了火的」。</p>
<p>「什麽」？</p>
<p>『放了火，燒盡了黑暗的人生！」</p>
<p>我默然。</p>
<p>到底，白衣使者還有前途</p>
<p>我不禁撫一下頭上的白帽！</p>

<p>『像你這種膿包，跟你做朋友簡直倒霉！劉禿子把右腿蹺在一條板凳上，敞開了一條羊皮大掛的上襟，倒豎着兩條漆黑的濃眉，聲色俱厲的說，差不多就想撲上去跟尚老二打架。</p>
<p>尚老二是才從樟樹屯回來，坐在劉禿子所讓給他的一間不到兩丈大見方的臥房裏，神氣顯得非常沮喪。</p>
<p>「寫的字據可以不算，那末什麽東西才好作準呢？」劉禿子亡命似的接連喊了幾句，不覺把一張上銳下豐的倒圓臉也漲得通紅了；一條又胖又矮的身軀上，裝着這麽一張猪肝色的圓臉，要是人從七八步以外望過去，眞像一個已經熟透了的南瓜！</p>
<p>他瞧尚老二還是沉默着不說話，自己的氣便越發往上升起來了。</p>
<p>「他是個什麼柬西，難道連理也不講嗎！」雖在舞台上劉禿子是一個大花臉，到了私底下，他也一直歡喜賣弄他一條粗嗓子。</p>
<p>「不管他十年前一個紅角兒也罷，是一個跑龍套也罷，只要他的女兒跟你磕頭過，學過戲，他自己就管不着！再說字據也寫定了，他憑什麼能夠反悔啊？這樣的事，眞虧你還忍得住！他媽的，惹得老子動起手來，不打死他也得敎他躺上三年兩載……」</p>
<p>「老兄弟，別這樣毛包胞脾氣的，你還沒有聽我說到下文咧！」尙老這才抬起頭來，有氣無力的說。</p>
<p>「下文？還有什麼下文啊！」劉禿子惡狠狠地瞧定着對方問，眞像他是在跟尚老二生氣一樣。（一九〇）</p>

<h3>高射砲手的訓練</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>英軍當局爲訓練高射砲手起見，特製造飛機模型一種，能在電綫上往來滑駛，另由高射砲手以「照像砲」瞄凖，以便於飛機駛入高射砲之射擊範圍內之時，扭動彈機。此種訓練方法，旣合實用，又省彈藥及模型飛機之消耗。且於天雨之時，亦可移人戶內訓練，毫無困難與不便。預料此等大量生產之高射砲手，必將予侵略之勁敵以嚴重之打擊也。</p>

<h3>孜孜不倦</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>美國喬治·華盛頓大學一九四一年的畢業班中，有位七十八歲的老學生，名叫哈搿脫夫人（Mrs.Isabelle　Barnes　Haggett）的；她那種孜孜不倦的求學精神，眞値得我們來倣效。她在八年前來到美國，為了要做些事業，乃決定入大學念書。她自己承認：當剛開始的時候，她很難與年青的學生們相競爭。她裝有一口假牙齒，使她原來的法國音無法改正；但她有着一股好學的熱誠，不論天氣壞到如何地步，她總不缺課的，終於以三等成績畢業。讀者們以爲她老人家讀得了學士銜頭就算完事了嗎？不，不，據她親自告人說，在秋季開學時，她還要繼續硏究歐洲史，來獲得碩士</p>
<p>所謂「學無止境」，所謂「學到老，學不了」，我們看了這樣一個「老而益壯」的例子，當然愈感到這兩句話的眞實了；我們青年人還有什麼理由可以荒廢學業，荒唐嬉戲？</p>

<p>法國的大博物家勒馬克的所以成名，決不是沒有原因的</p>
<p>由於環境的關係，勒馬克在十七歲時，就毅然地走進了軍營，而馳騁戰塲了。眞是不幸得很，這位少年英豪，不到四年便遇到了意外。迫不得已，到巴黎去養病。然而，依他的病勢，必須安靜地與鐵床作一年的伴侶。</p>
<p>勒馬克的病室，是一間屋頂上的小樓，這時，他的苦痛，誰也想像得出的吧。不過，從全室所僅有的天窗望出去，天際，來來往往絡繹不絕的浮雲，却引起了他的興趣。在寂寞的時候，勒馬克利用空閒的時間，做着旁人認爲毫無意義的事。他把各種雲分門別類地根據它們的形式，結構，而判別出對於氣候所產生的影響。例如，大片的黑色「雨雲」會帶來粉紛的白雪。層層疊疊的「堆積雲」，若是出現在東方，該是冗長的炎暑消減的預兆，還有，美麗而薄薄的「白色卷雲」，可以決定一個晴朗的天氣。</p>
<p>後來，勒馬克終於全愈了，他可以再入軍隊，但是他對於各種天氣都能一目瞭然，於是，從此以後勒馬克便從事自然事業。</p>

<h3>台下藝術</h3>
<p>— 章崧然</p>
<p>臺上藝術，有像案目壟斷座位，小販穿梭般的叫囂，以及燈光的配合，安全的設備等等，也隨着時代在許多比較高尙些的遊藝塲中，逐漸改善了，現在只賸下整塲合的觀衆，還沒有領會到娛樂的眞諦，大而言之，就是社會上一般普通秩序，小而言之，就是我所耍說的「臺下藝術」。</p>
<p>到電影院裹去尋開心的上海人，比較最能够守時間，因爲遲了，「客滿」牌就要高懸院門以外，誤了卯，是要打回票的，即使僥倖買到了票子，而預告片已經開映，黑漆漆的一團，是不容易給你選上一個角度旣好而叉舒適的座位的。</p>
<p>話劇塲比不得低級的文明戲，百分之九十九的座上客都是智識份子，可是不守時間的就多了些，往往第二幕或第三幕剛開始時，還有人陸陸續續搖擺着進來，話劇這玩意兒，一幕有一慕的精彩，一景有一景的價値，少看一幕，就不能明瞭劇中人的個性和本位，更沒有方法懂得劇情的貫串，化錢也許不在乎，對你所需要的目的，豈不離開得很遠嗎？話劇演員是用一種平鋪直叙的對白來發揮的，不比京戲裏有什麼六字調乙字調，所以塲中更需要「靜」，可是也有些人在這當口，咳嗽吐痰，此伏彼起，一呼百諾，鬧得烏烟瘴氣。</p>
<p>國劇塲最糟，三層樓不在話下，從正廳說起，據云看開鑼戲的都是外行，內行是要到名角上塲才準時光臨的，這也是對號入座的好處。所以汽車階級看來，和案目時代一樣的沒有窒礙，來遲的人，站在你面前，一方面等侍者領座，一方面先覩爲快，至於是吾擋住旁人的視綫，那就不在他腦筋裹。入座之後，呼茶引烟，還要吃瓜子剝橋皮，假使臺上正演着精彩的一環，或是一句好腔，被這樣一來，豈不白白錯過！有時戲還沒有終了，其實距散塲不過數分鐘光景，有些人都在抽籤了，比如說馬謖斬了，孔明的哭頭，就不必聽了</p>
<p>總之，不妨碍大衆的自由，才算眞自由。</p>

<p>最近趙燕士費兩個月的心血將法國劇壇名著改編完成，就是劇藝社的開山戲「人之初」，顧蘭君白虹主演的「金銀世界」，過去此劇雖然很負盛名，但據法國領事館評說：「可惜把很好的喜劇演得太嚴重了！」這一决綠寶根據這句評語無論如何要抓住主題克服這一點，劇名就稱「金銀世界」作一次大規模的演出。</p>

<h3>Ambassador Hu Shih Meets with Hull, Exchanges Views on Far Eastern Issues, U.S. Orders Investigation into Sino-British-Soviet War Needs and Will Provide Credit Loans to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Washington, 19th – Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Hu Shih, visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull today to exchange various views on Far Eastern issues. They also discussed the Eight-Point Declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill, it is said.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th – U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Hu Shih, delivered a note from the Chinese government to the U.S. government this morning, stating that the Chinese government agrees with the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. The U.S. government is extremely pleased to learn of this. He also said that China is the first foreign government to express its support for the historic Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. Hull's attitude during the conversation showed great pleasure at this impulsive move by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th – According to a Washington dispatch from Dow Jones News Service, Secretary of State Hull, when entertaining reporters yesterday, mentioned the issue of the U.S. providing credit loans to the Soviet Union. Hull said that the Soviet Union only has four million dollars in cash deposited in the U.S., so it is difficult for the Soviet Union to immediately pay for war equipment worth more than this amount. However, the Soviet Union has stated that all purchases are intended to be paid for. The issue of providing credit loans to the Soviet Union will be decided by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Central Loan Administrator. Although the Soviet Union only has $40 million deposited in the U.S., according to some sources, the supply requested by the Soviet Union is worth more than one hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th – Two hundred reporters from various countries gathered at the White House today to listen to President Roosevelt's first remarks to reporters after the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Most of the content of Roosevelt's remarks was not allowed to be published.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th – President Roosevelt said yesterday after meeting with British and American defense officials that the current position of the United States is the same as during the Civil War. President Roosevelt met with British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook for an hour and a half regarding measures on how the United States can help Britain and the Soviet Union. The President, accompanied by Lord Beaverbrook and Lend-Lease Administrator Harriman, held a second arms conference with Mr. Nattson, Mr. Hieldom, Mr. Forrest, and Mr. Patterson. Forrest and Patterson were the Undersecretaries representing the Navy and Army Departments. President Roosevelt refused to comment on the Far East situation at the press conference. According to the President's remarks to reporters, his meeting with Churchill will increase U.S. aid to democratic countries. If necessary, this aid will be extended to 1943 to contain Nazi aggression. President Roosevelt said that the United States and Britain are currently listing the production needs of the Navy and Army Departments and a list of actual transportation for the summer of next year, urging that the U.S. wartime production be closely linked to the needs of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Current Situation is Extremely Serious, the War May Extend to Next Year</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 20th – President Roosevelt said on a yacht the other day that, in his view, the United States is not closer to war than before, but yesterday, when entertaining reporters at the White House, he said that the American people are currently in a situation almost similar to the Civil War era, and also hinted that the current European war may be extended to the end of next year. Political figures were quite surprised that the President's two statements contradicted each other. It is believed that after his first statement was released, foreign countries thought that the situation had eased, so he corrected it again yesterday. In fact, the main purpose of the President's remarks on the yacht was to explain that although he met with British Prime Minister Churchill at sea this time, this move would not prompt the United States to armed intervention in the current war. The key to whether Italy will be involved in the war is not in any U.S. initiative, but in the future actions of the Axis powers. In short, the President's first statement was to deal with the attacks of domestic isolationists, while the first statement made yesterday was to awaken public opinion to the seriousness of the current situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th – President Roosevelt said to reporters yesterday that if necessary, the war will continue in 1943, and Britain and the United States will investigate and count the needs and production of that year. When a reporter asked, "Does the Prime Minister believe that Britain can win without U.S. assistance?" The President replied that he thought this question was useless, just like a newspaper headline is good, but has no substance. The President then recited a passage from a biography of Lincoln, which said that in 1862, one year after the start of the American Civil War, President Lincoln said that the country could strategically extricate itself from difficulties, which the people did not know. The war must be carried out with perseverance and struggle, and some people will be injured in the struggle, which the people do not fully understand. A reporter asked, "If the President were to write a headline for this news, what would it be?" The President replied, "I would say 'The President quoted Lincoln's words as an analogy'." The reporter asked, "Is the analogy for the current situation of the country?" The President replied, "Yes." The President said that he and British cabinet member Lord Beaverbrook had instructed the Navy and Army to investigate and estimate the actual production and supply volume for the entire year of 1943 a week ago. If Britain also does this, he will be happy for it. As for the needs of China and the Soviet Union, they may also need to be handled. The United States conducted a similar survey a year ago, and now it needs to be done again, because if necessary, the war will continue in 1943. The President also mentioned the arrangements before the meeting with the British Prime Minister, saying that on the U.S. side, the overall U.S. arrangement was to ensure the safety of Churchill and other entourage members, so everything was kept secret. However, the newspapers must have noticed the appropriate relocation of some important people in Washington and London. It is commendable that the newspapers were able to remain silent during this week of strict secrecy as if implementing a blackout. Even today, the time and place of the meeting are still not convenient to disclose, and the details will have to wait until after the war to be announced.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th – British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook will have dinner with President Roosevelt and Hopkins today, presumably to discuss accelerating the shipment of war equipment to Britain and aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Two U.S. Warships Visit Australia, Will Sail to Batavia, Duff Cooper Talks About Future Mission, Britain Intends to Discuss Cooperation with Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Washington, 19th – It is reported that the two U.S. warships that recently visited Australia will sail to Batavia for a short stay. It is also said that the Batavia side has firmly denied the rumors from Japan that the Dutch East Indies is preparing to resume normal business with Japan.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th – British War Cabinet Representative to the Far East, Duff Cooper, told reporters here yesterday that he intends to visit Batavia soon to discuss cooperation with the Dutch East Indies authorities. He also intends to visit Australia. His mission is twofold: one is to investigate the facts and report to the British government, and the other is to implement the plans entrusted to him. The purpose of his visit to Batavia is to seek a basis for more direct exchange of views. He would like to state here that his mission was decided before the current tense situation in the Far East, and is not directed at Japan. Cooper is scheduled to depart from San Francisco on August 26 and arrive in Singapore on September 2.</p>
<p>Australian Parliament Holds Secret Meeting</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 20th – Australian Prime Minister Menzies said in a speech in the House of Representatives today that Australia recognizes Singapore and Malaya as important outposts. Although Australia loves peace, it will not hesitate to make any sacrifices when necessary. In view of the tension created by Japan in the Far East, he and all cabinet members believe that it is important for Australia to send a representative to London. He does not want to make any remarks that would disrupt peace in the Pacific. However, the so-called encirclement claimed by Japan, if the intention is to create the belief that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are currently carrying out military encirclement against Japan, it is obviously not true. What has caused the tension is Japan's actions, not ours. If the tension can be eased, the power is actually in the hands of Japan. He also praised the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting for opening a new era of Anglo-American cooperation, and said that the human rights declaration issued by both sides has a great spiritual impact on both inside and outside Europe. After the speech, Parliament held a secret meeting that lasted six hours before adjourning. The government and the Labor Party are scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss Menzies' trip to London. It is generally expected that the Labor Party will likely not agree.</p>
<h3>Scott Advocates Complete Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – Scott, liaison officer for the Committee to Defend America, recently telegraphed the committee in New York from London, advocating abandoning the slogans of "Defending America" and "Aiding Britain," and adopting a policy of complete participation in the war, joining Britain to defeat Nazism. The telegram said, "Our procedure advocates complete participation in the war so that we can win and create peace. If we are willing to contribute to the victory at any cost, we will have the right to speak when establishing world justice."</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Student Aid Campaign - Acknowledging Support from All Sectors While Encouraging Students -</h3>
<p>The establishment of this newspaper's student aid fund truly began on the thirteenth of last month, lasting a total of thirty-eight days until yesterday, the date of approval for all slots. During this extremely short period, we were honored to receive warm sympathy from readers, some donating funds, others giving advice. Over 54,000 yuan was collected, with over 2,000 students from various schools requesting application forms, 856 officially applying, and 347 actually receiving assistance. Colleagues at this newspaper were divided to handle visits and reviews, with the final decision entrusted to a specially established committee. As the semester begins, we are delighted to see the selected students fulfill their desire to learn. Like planting a tree, this is its foundation. In addition to running around, the colleagues at this newspaper feel excited, forgetting their hard work, and wish to express their thoughts and encourage the students.</p>
<p>From the highest essence of education, what is education? It is the transmission and creation of a nation's life experiences. Therefore, education is one of the most fundamental construction works of a country and society. All citizens have the right to enjoy education, and the state should also make it the duty of the people to receive education. Our country has advocated universal education for decades, but has not yet achieved remarkable results, limited by financial resources and geographical location. However, from the social aspect, the function of assistance and promotion has not been fully realized. The youth of today are members of the future society. Will they become useful talents to benefit the people, or will their lack of education prevent them from contributing to the public? This depends on the education they receive at this time. In these times of rapid change and difficult livelihoods, poor students are limited by financial and environmental constraints and cannot universally fulfill their desire to study. If we serve society, we should cultivate excellent members for society. If we allow poor students to waste their time and do not give them opportunities for further study, it is an irreparable loss to society. How can we remain indifferent at every thought!</p>
<p>In the past year, this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from poor students, stating their difficult circumstances and their sincere desire to learn. The attached academic records are also impressive, ranging from elementary school and middle school to vocational schools and universities. Some have studied for several years and are about to fall short. This newspaper has always taken serving society and promoting culture as its mission. Whenever public welfare is involved, it is always willing to contribute, never lagging behind. Now that it sympathizes with the plight of out-of-school youth, it has to make a sincere appeal to its broad readership, appealing to society with the most urgent social issues and seeking ways to solve them together.</p>
<p>The society's strong sympathy, encouragement, and supervision truly inspire and excite our colleagues and prevent them from stopping themselves. Since the start of the student aid fund, readers have enthusiastically donated, reaching all levels of society. Business leaders and members of the banking industry have contributed large amounts, which is of course the case, but shop apprentices, booksellers, newspaper vendors, and servants also raced to contribute their hard-earned money to fulfill this thought of "it is most joyful to do good." Eventually, they moved monks and nuns, who generously donated their income from chanting scriptures to help students. Even saving on transportation and cigarettes, and innocent children giving all they had to engage in this, it happened every day. Most worthy of cherishing is an anonymous old man who donated a large sum of money, admitting that he is close to sixty years old, in his twilight years, with a small business and weak ability, willing to contribute his meager strength as a small contribution. If he is still alive next semester and his business does not change suddenly, he will continue to help. Our colleagues were deeply admired when they met the old man. We believe that this kind of sincere and great act of righteousness is enough to represent the noblest sense of justice in society. With this thought, what cannot be done? We have also deeply realized that there is an infinite sense of sympathy latent among the broad masses of society. If it can be well advocated and promoted, it can be enthusiastically promoted and jointly achieve a valuable cause. Now, this broad sympathy has been jointly obtained by this newspaper and its readers.</p>
<p>Our colleagues are aware of their heavy responsibilities and have been entrusted with the work of investigation. They have asked questions in detail and strived to make the reports accurate, so that the money donated by enthusiastic readers is not wasted in the slightest, and that poor students with a desire to learn, who have excellent grades and pure conduct, must be able to gain practical benefits. With this belief, we have worked hard from beginning to end and have never dared to change. As for the family circumstances of the applying students, we have also been entrusted with sincerity and told frankly. Summarizing what has been said, there are several points: Some students have families that used to be very well-off, but have suddenly become impoverished due to relocation and exile. Those who rely on salaries for courage, or because they have lost their shelter, cannot make ends meet. Or if their fathers and brothers are serving far away, their meager income is difficult to maintain the livelihood of individuals, let alone provide for their children's education? As for widows and orphans, suffering from poverty and hardship, they are in a tragic situation. All these things that our colleagues have heard and seen have touched us in many ways, and we recognize that student aid cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>The review seeks to achieve an even development of academics and conduct. The occupations of the applicants' fathers and brothers and the number of people in the whole family cannot be ignored. As the cost of living is getting higher and higher, eight people in a family, four of whom are studying, the total amount of income and the proportion of expenditure should be carefully studied. Our colleagues studied each case and reviewed it again and again, striving to have no doubts before signing the final opinion. The gentlemen on the committee are all well-known figures in the education field. They asked about the work of each group with great concern and did not tire of being thorough. They approved applications from students who could be given the opportunity. Their enthusiasm was the same as the goodwill of the readers of this newspaper who donated. The committee held three meetings one after another, and the gentlemen came to a stop in the hot summer and lasted for a long time. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are extremely admirable, and this is what this newspaper and its readers should solemnly thank them for.</p>
<p>There is also an announcement for the selected students. Student aid is not a relief effort. The gathering of student aid funds is based on compassion and has the value of encouraging and cultivating talents for society. The selected students, who receive this assistance, should not regard it as relieving temporary economic difficulties, but as an honor, like a school's honorary scholarship. The most valuable experiences in our lives are nothing more than helping others, helping ourselves, and helping others. Now that the students have received help from others, they should strive to cultivate their moral character and study hard, strive to move forward and seek ways to help themselves. When they have sufficient self-help ability, they should help others. The students who receive help from society today will repay society a hundredfold in the future. We hope that this newspaper's student aid fund will be the beginning, and that there will be hundreds of student aid funds to follow. Students, work hard!</p>
<h3>Prelude to Sino-Soviet Military Negotiations, Cheng Qian Embarks for Moscow, Mutual Assistance Agreement Possible</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 20th – Sources here, known to be reliable, confirmed yesterday that Cheng Qian will depart from Chongqing via Zhengzhou for Moscow. It is widely believed that Cheng's trip is actually a prelude to Sino-Soviet military negotiations, and that the realization of Sino-Soviet military negotiations will likely lead to the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Free China and the Soviet Union. General Cheng Qian is one of Chairman Chiang's most trusted military and political observers, it is said.</p>

<h3>Memories of Rabindranath Tagore's Visit to India's Poet Saint (V)</h3>
<p>— Xu Baoqian</p>
<p>Appendix (An Account of Tagore's Travels in China and Russia)</p>
<p>In 1924, Tagore visited China at the invitation of Chinese friends. On April 12, Tagore gave a speech to student groups in Shanghai, saying, "More than a thousand years ago, India sent her friendly envoys to China. Although this exchange was later interrupted, we were able to find some traces. I hope that China and India can restore this glorious friendship."</p>
<p>On April 23, Tagore arrived in Beijing. Jiang Menglin and the American Ms. Li Jiabai, among others, welcomed him at the station. On the 28th, Tagore gave a speech to more than a thousand students at the Temple of Earth. In early May, he gave a speech at Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>He said, "We should celebrate ourselves for being born in this great era. You Chinese youth should first recognize your own culture. Some say that Chinese culture is realistic and materialistic. I don't believe this. Your inherent social organization expresses a selfless spirit everywhere. Your nation does not worship money, nor does it worship force. I don't believe your culture is materialistic. I have traveled all over China and seen that the land is cultivated very well, and all the daily utensils express the beauty of art; these all express spiritual culture. I think you can manage material things without being burdened by them, which is your greatness. From your inherent civilization, it is not difficult to see the difference between material civilization and spiritual civilization. Now the cultural mainstream of the East and West are about to converge, and you should hurry up and make your contributions."</p>
<p>Tagore's speech caused praise from Chinese and foreign people at that time. Among them, the most skillful was Professor Wang Kunshan of Tsinghua University, who said: "Tagore is indeed an Eastern prophet. Their speeches come from a mysterious consciousness, which seems to be impeccable. However, after careful analysis, we feel that what he wants to answer is a very practical question, that is: What kind of contribution does Chinese culture have? Tagore said: Chinese culture expresses beauty and spirit everywhere, so it is not materialistic. But we want to ask, is it not so for other nations? Is this the only contribution of Chinese culture? Tagore thinks that Chinese culture has already overcome the contradiction between completeness and progress. Yes, we are also willing to think so, but we can only hope to think so."</p>
<p>On May 25, Shang Wuxiantang and Li Jiabai held a farewell party for Tagore. At the banquet, Tagore explained his religious beliefs as follows: "After I arrived in China, someone asked me if I believed in God. I find it difficult to answer this question. However, since the world is so beautiful, I can't believe that it is a mechanical product. Flowers, trees, and birds all have a lively mission for me. Although we cannot know what will happen after death, I feel and firmly believe that there is a great and compassionate spirit in the universe. As for what we call this great spirit, that is a secondary question." Tagore also said: He is not very interested in the creeds and rituals of various religions. His own family has been engaged in the reform of Hinduism. However, his own religious views come entirely from the aesthetic sense given by nature. Behind the beauty of nature, he discovered the existence of the great spirit.</p>
<p>Since Tagore shouldered the mission of international culture, he naturally wanted to go and see the new experiment in Soviet Russia. In 1926, the Soviet government officially invited Tagore. Tagore traveled to Vienna, but returned midway due to illness. Later, Tagore went to Canada to give speeches. He originally planned to take the Siberian Railway to Russia when he returned to China from Canada in 1929, but he stopped again due to illness.</p>
<p>After 1930, Tagore's long-cherished wish was finally realized. He arrived in Moscow on September 11. Among those who came to welcome him at the station were several important figures in the Soviet literary and cultural circles. Tagore stayed in Moscow for two weeks. In addition to talking with literary and artistic circles, he paid special attention to the Communist Youth League, peasant clubs, and university student groups. In addition, Tagore also held a personal painting exhibition.</p>
<p>Tagore's purpose in entering Russia was explained at the first reception: My purpose is to come to your country to learn about your experience in dealing with world cultural issues. Modern culture has made mankind violate nature and increased human suffering infinitely. Now you are solving human cultural problems on a large scale. History will have its own conclusions about its success or failure. I don't want to make unreasonable criticisms here. However, your courage is admirable. My educational ideal is to create free personalities and develop human creativity. I believe your ideals are the same as mine.</p>
<p>On September 17, Tagore held a personal painting exhibition, which was greatly praised by Soviet artists. According to Tagore, he is not a painter, and his paintings come from momentary impulses. However, according to the appreciation of Soviet artists, Tagore's paintings have become a style of their own, lively and powerful, opening a new era for the art world.</p>
<p>On September 24, the eve of Tagore's departure from Russia, Tagore delivered a farewell speech at the Trade Union Confederation: "The lives, education, economy, and sanitation of the Indian people are all very backward, and there are often military dramas between various religions. Because of this, although I am old, I still do not spare any effort to come to your country to visit. During my stay, I saw your various great undertakings and felt very admired. Your progress can be said to be a miracle."</p>
<p>On September 25, before leaving, Tagore told a reporter from Pravda: "Your efforts are commendable. However, I dare not agree with your policy of excluding dissidents. Because your ultimate goal is also to seek happiness for all mankind, but the opinions of all mankind can never be the same. It must be known that grievances should be resolved rather than tied. If you hate the other party today, the other party will take the opportunity to retaliate tomorrow and make you collapse." (End)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Is Underway on the Entire Line from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>Southern Red Army Retreats to the East Bank of the Dnieper River; German Army Establishes New War Zone North of Kiev</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: Fierce fighting is reported in the Novgorod and Gomel areas, indicating that the Germans are continuing to exert significant pressure on Leningrad and have established a new war zone north of Kiev. The above two areas were initially mentioned in today's bulletin from the Soviet Information Bureau. Added to the information that the Soviet army is currently engaged in fierce rear-guard battles in Ukraine, it can be seen that major battles are underway on the entire line from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. Reuters, London, 20th: German forces in the south are attempting to break through the Soviet defenses of Odessa, a major port on the Black Sea. Fierce fighting continued yesterday. In the north, German pressure on the Soviet forces under General Voroshilov seems to have intensified. The Soviet army is resisting strongly in Kingisepp (70 miles southwest of Leningrad) and Novgorod (100 miles southeast of Leningrad). Other features of the war in Soviet territory yesterday were that there was also fighting in the Gomel area of Belarus (175 miles southwest of Smolensk) and Soviet bombers sank two transport ships in the Black Sea. A Soviet communiqué announced that on Sunday night, Soviet bombers again bombed Ploesti, an important oil-producing city north of the Romanian capital, while the German side reiterated that the German army's aim was not to occupy more land but to annihilate the Red Army. According to recent news from Ukraine, the Soviet forces led by General Budenny have retreated across the Dnieper. The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following communiqué at midnight yesterday: "On August 19, the Soviet army engaged the enemy along the entire line. The fighting was fierce in Kingisepp, Novgorod, Gomel, and Odessa. According to current information received, in an air battle on August 17, 28 German aircraft were shot down. On the 17th, Soviet aircraft raided Ploesti at night, and explosions and fires broke out immediately. On the 18th, 30 German aircraft were shot down in an air battle. The Soviets lost 12 aircraft. The Soviet army sank two enemy transport ships in the Black Sea, and another was hit and caught fire."</p>
<p>The Germans Have Demonstrated River-Crossing Skills; The Soviet Army's Decision to Breach the Dam Is Hardly a Good Strategy</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 20th: German pressure in the Ukrainian region and the northwest continues to be fierce. After the Soviets acknowledged the loss of Nikolaev and Krivoy Rog yesterday, there is no sign of progress in the fighting in this area. Judging from the current situation, the German army is now trying to ravage the entire industrial area within the Dnieper River Bay. In the next few days, it will be possible to see whether the Soviet army decides to defend this industrial area or prepares to defend the east bank of the Dnieper River, which is one and a half miles wide, with trenches. The German army's skills in crossing large rivers were demonstrated in France, so the Soviet army may not consider retreating to the east of the Dnieper River as the best option, or they may prefer to fight bravely before abandoning valuable industrial areas. A peculiar point in the Dnieper River battle is the famous Dnieper River Dam, which was created by the Soviet government at the cost of huge manpower and financial resources. If there is no impregnable defense, the German army may use this dam to cross the river. If the Soviets destroy this dam, the water level in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River will be reduced, which is especially dangerous. This is perhaps a difficult matter for the Soviets to decide.</p>
<p>German Forces Advance on Three Routes on the Northern Front to Encircle Leningrad</p>
<p>In the past few days, the German army has again put pressure on Leningrad, apparently intending to encircle the city on three or four routes. Some days ago, the German army reached the southern shore of Lake Ilmen. Their purpose is either to directly attack Leningrad to the north or to advance east to cut off the railway between Leningrad and Moscow. The situation in that area is currently unclear. The German army, which attacked the Pskov area several weeks ago, has abandoned its plan to directly attack Leningrad and turned east to attack Lake Ilmen. As for the task of directly attacking Leningrad, it is entrusted to the German army from Estonia. The road that the German army must have taken is the road that General Yudenich was defeated by the Red Army and the revolutionary workers of Leningrad in 1920. The defense of Leningrad is what every Soviet person aspires to. The area has important industrial resources, and the defense must be extremely strong, so it is expected that the great city will now demonstrate its heroic spirit and will to win, just as it did in the early days of the revolution. In addition, there has been an army from Finland advancing on Leningrad, but it has not yet succeeded, because the situation is favorable for the Soviet army to defend, and many Finnish soldiers are unwilling to serve for the German side. Another noteworthy development is that there are many Soviet troops trapped in various places on the northern and southern fronts, such as the Odessa area and within Estonia. In particular, several Soviet naval bases are still fighting to the end, such as the Soviet naval base on Hanko Island in the Netherlands, which is still in the hands of the Soviet army, causing major obstacles to German navigation in the Baltic Sea. Now that the German army is forced to fight in the winter, the activities of the Soviet army trapped in these places will become more important.</p>
<p>Soviets Resolve to Fully Defend the Capital; Fresh Troops Are Steadily Deployed to the Front Lines</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 20th: On the 17th, 15,000 workers in Moscow convened a conference to defend the capital. Pruning, Chairman of the Moscow City Executive Committee, delivered the opening speech. He said that the German air raids have not disrupted the daily work of the people of Moscow. The conference also issued a declaration to all the people of Moscow, stating, "We are facing a long and fierce struggle, which requires great sacrifice and endurance. People of the capital, you should stand ready and step up your work, turning every house and factory into an impregnable fortress." TASS, Moscow, 20th: The famous Soviet writer Pavlovrenko recently published an article in "Red Star" describing the situation of the Soviet Union actively training reserve forces. The article said, "Not far from the front line, large numbers of reserve personnel are arriving in teams every day, and the training camp is full of vitality. When a batch of teams are trained and leave the camp, they are immediately replenished by reserve teams coming from thousands of miles away. The training of tank crew members is particularly active. After familiarizing themselves with driving skills, they immediately set off for the front lines. Most of them are tractor drivers, car drivers, and other specialists, many of whom have participated in the battles of Lake Khasan and Mengnaxin."</p>

He hopes to return to the United States on October 24th or 21st.</p>
<h3>American Writer Hemingway and Wife's Tour of the Mountain Defense Line (3)</h3>
<p>We walked uphill for another five hours, and then the downstream journey came to an end. It had been twenty-four hours since we left the Longguang Inn, and the rain had not stopped. Before leaving, it was still two days away from Qian. There is no Maginot Line or Mannerheim Line in China. There are continuous mountains here. Using high mountains as a screen, machine guns can be used for defense, without the need to set up heavy artillery.</p>
<p>A rapid offensive is impossible here because mechanized units cannot be used in the narrow mountain paths. However, the Japanese army can use airplanes, while the Chinese side lacks them. In the mountains, when you look at the front line situation, it is just a mountain, majestic and silent, towering under the sky.</p>
<p>The size of this war zone is like Belgium, with a population of about 30 million. There are two armies stationed here, totaling about 150,000 men. The communication between the front line and the headquarters relies entirely on military telephones, which are always a day's journey away.</p>
<p>Arduous and Extraordinary</p>
<p>Chinese soldiers cannot ask for leave because there is only one 500-mile-long railway line here, and there is a shortage of gasoline for cars. Even if the soldiers want to go home, there is no way to do so. Therefore, some troops have been stationed here for as long as two years, and the troops must train for their own lives. Each unit has a parade ground, a sports field, classrooms, reading rooms, and barracks. Headquarters and officer training camps are often located in villages close to the rear.</p>
<p>The Chinese army has very amazing military education. After each decisive contact, a number of officers and junior soldiers who have completed their tasks are transferred back from the front line to training camps for one to three months of study. After they return to their units, they can train ordinary soldiers. Therefore, the army often discusses practical experience and corrects its own shortcomings. Speaking of which, there are tailors in the village with white stones, and many young soldiers in fancy clothes are studying military science there, but that is not the case. The headquarters and schools are made of bamboo fences and mud bricks, very simple, all built by the soldiers themselves.</p>
<p>The cleanliness and management of the houses and grounds in the army are well done, which is the only thing we have seen since we came to China. The army tries to make up for the shortcomings in equipment through training and organization. The training is based on the Prussian style, focusing on strictness and effectiveness, resulting in an army of 500,000 men who do not even wear leather shoes, but have a full understanding of how to fight. The army's salary is the lowest among government service personnel. In fact, it is the lowest salary in any institution in China. A colonel's monthly salary is only 150 yuan in legal tender, which is equivalent to only 7.25 U.S. dollars. But a pair of leather shoes in Chongqing costs 200 yuan, and the price of rice has also increased seven times compared to before the war. Ordinary soldiers earn 4.5 yuan in legal tender (25 U.S. cents) per month, plus some rice subsidies. The rice subsidy is 8 U.S. cents, and even with this money, he still cannot eat enough. It is said that a porter who carries things earns twice as much per month as a colonel. The low salary system of the army and the lack of necessary food for those who are sick and injured are the two major misfortunes in the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Reception</p>
<p>After we dismounted at the headquarters, we saw slogans in English welcoming us. The red letters were underlined and posted on the guard post, barracks, and mud walls of the headquarters. The slogans read: "Welcome the representatives who uphold justice and peace." "Democratic countries unite and fight to the final victory." These slogans were drafted and printed by the staff of the political department. Once, they ran from a neighboring village to inquire where we were going so that they could rush ahead to post the slogans.</p>
<p>We brushed off the raindrops on our faces, bowed with a smile, and thanked them for their sincere hospitality. The commander-in-chief wore white gloves to show his solemnity and returned our greetings repeatedly. The wind blew into the house, blowing through the windows without glass. We sat next to a pot of blazing charcoal fire, secretly drying our shoes and calves. The commander chatted with us in his spare time.</p>
<p>The wind blew all night, and it didn't seem cold while sleeping. But tomorrow morning, the sky will be clear, and we can see the distant mountains undulating. We rode our horses up the hill. The interpreter, Ma Jun, rode right behind me. Ma Jun was small in stature, wore a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses that were too big for him, had a good appetite, and had two American degrees, but had no military experience. He now works in the Political Department in Shaoguan.</p>
<p>"Ma Guangsheng," I pointed to the scorched mountain in front and said, "Why did they burn all the trees on this mountain?" "They want to drive away the tigers on the mountain," Ma Jun said. "You see, tigers eat the fine roots and grasses of certain plants. If they burn the trees, they will feel hungry and run away."</p>
<p>After nine hours of riding without food or water, I felt very tired, but the Chinese did not feel tired. They can silently accept any changes: hunger, fatigue, cold, thirst, pain, and danger. They are the most resilient people in the world. We dismounted in a village, which was also the headquarters of a regimental unit. The headquarters building was made of brick, and the streets were all dirt paths, full of garbage and filth. There were no sewers.</p>
<p>We followed an officer on horseback to the parade ground to inspect a battalion of soldiers. These soldiers were originally farmers and coolies. Before joining the army, they had never even held something as complicated as a flashlight. If you look at them alone, or in small squads scattered in the mountains, they are as pitiful as orphans, as ragged as beggars. But in this solemn formation, equipped with rifles, machine guns, automatic rifles, and hand grenades, they look like a strong and experienced team. Now they began to drill, with the sergeant shouting sharp commands. The old men in the village watched quietly, standing by the fields with a proud look on their faces. When the war broke out, other farmers rescued the wounded and carried them on bamboo stretchers through rugged mountain roads to the rear hospitals. There was no water to drink along the way, no dressing station. If no one was willing to carry them, there would be no wounded soldiers, they would all die!</p>
<p>"We are going to put on a play tonight," the officer said. The Chinese army lit bonfires on the parade ground, and twelve hundred people sat on the hard, cold dirt, waiting for the play to begin. A blue cloth curtain was hung on the bamboo stage, and they spent an hour and a half setting up a gas lamp. Suddenly the light came on, then slowly dimmed, finally adjusting to the appropriate brightness. Two soldiers pulled the curtain open, and the play began. The name of the play was "Ghosts." It was wonderful. At the end of the play, twelve hundred soldiers applauded wildly. Even a famous play staged in New York would not have such enthusiasm. The political department puts on a play for the soldiers every week.</p>

<h3>Under Economic Pressure, Japan Still Tries to Struggle</h3>
<p>Britain Denies Negotiating a Barter Agreement with Japan, Resolves Not to Relax the Freezing of Supplies to Japan</p>
<p>United Press, London, 20th - The news that Japan proposed to Britain and the Netherlands to establish a barter agreement but was denied by Britain yesterday proves that Tokyo is now beginning to struggle under the economic pressure of the Allied countries. Dutch authorities acknowledge that private companies in the Dutch East Indies have allowed their coffee, tea, and sugar merchants to discuss trade matters with Japan. However, these people solemnly pointed out that the Dutch East Indies government has no intention of approving export permits, so these merchants cannot sell goods to Japan even if they want to. Authorities here said that the Dutch East Indies has no intention of resuming oil exports, and it is impossible to include rubber in the scope of export discussions as rumored by private businesses.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 20th - A responsible statement was issued here last night, saying that the rumor that Britain and Japan were negotiating a barter agreement seemed to have originated from information obtained by the Yokohama Specie Bank. The information mentioned the use that the bank could allow in the future flow of approved goods. The fact is that, in order to fully maintain the effectiveness of the freezing order, frozen funds cannot be released to supply exports to Japan. However, a method is now being considered: if a license for the import of Japanese goods is decided to be issued in any special case, the payment for this licensed import must be paid into a clearing account, and the funds in this clearing account can only be used to pay for licensed exports to Japan. Export licenses can only be issued for approved goods that can be paid for by funds in the clearing account. Similar arrangements are currently being made elsewhere in the British Empire, and the maintenance costs of diplomats and consuls are also provided in the same way.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 20th - The Yokohama Specie Bank yesterday firmly denied that the bank is currently negotiating a barter agreement with the Bank of England.</p>
<h3>Toyota-Grew Talks Broad in Scope</h3>
<p>Tokyo Asks to Restore Commerce, U.S. Effectively Rejects</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Washington, 20th - Hull declared at a press conference yesterday that Foreign Minister Toyota and Ambassador Grew had a long conversation the day before. The discussion was not limited to the issue of American nationals leaving Japan. Political figures here believe that all important Japanese-American issues were mentioned.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 20th - Japan's request to restore normal Japanese-American commercial relations has been effectively rejected by the United States. It is evident that the U.S. will adopt a more advanced economic strategy to deal with Japan. The U.S. government has made it clear to Japan that the U.S. is unwilling to make economic concessions to Japan by restoring commerce, because the U.S. is certain that this trade may be used to strengthen Japan's military establishment, and the U.S. may one day suffer the consequences. The government replied to Japan's request that the U.S. is willing to supply Japan with crude oil to meet peacetime needs, but the U.S. insists on its policy of not transporting military supplies to Japan. If Japan still threatens to disrupt the status quo in the Pacific and the Far East, the U.S. will continue to impose economic sanctions. It is rumored that Tokyo is also aware that if it continues to cooperate with the Axis powers, it must be prepared to accept the consequences of possible retaliatory actions by the Allied countries. It is also implied that if Japan does not change its policy, it will be subjected to an economic blockade by Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union, and will not be able to obtain goods from any country.</p>
<h3>U.S. Awaiting Japanese Explanation on Rejection of Evacuation</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th - Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that the United States is still waiting for Japan to provide a satisfactory explanation for the rejection of the evacuation of American nationals. Hull said at a press conference that the report sent by U.S. Ambassador Grew to Washington is, so far, not sufficient to determine what action the United States will take. Before making this statement, Hull had a brief conversation with Secretary of War Stimson. Afterwards, Secretary Stimson said that the content of their conversation was only a general exchange of information on the international situation.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Talks Conclude with Four Points</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Washington, 20th - Both the "Washington Post" and the "Washington Times Herald" published editorials today stating that the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting has decided on four points: (1) to open an air route from the United States to Africa, with American pilots flying American planes and handing them over to the British Air Force; (2) Roosevelt and Churchill are very optimistic about the Soviet Union's resistance, believing that the Soviet Union can pay for American loans with food and gold; (3) the attitude of Britain and the United States towards Japan is becoming increasingly tough, in order to prevent Japan from taking any measures against Siberia or Thailand; (4) the United States has no obligation to participate in the war. The above four points were announced after the White House received the Democratic leaders.</p>
<h3>Heated Debate in U.S. Senate</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 20th - During a heated debate in the Senate yesterday over the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, Barkley claimed that when President Roosevelt and congressional leaders met at the White House, the possibility of the United States sending an expeditionary force to help Britain attack the European continent was neither discussed nor indicated. Republican Senator Johnson said that point six of the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration has established a defense alliance between Britain and the United States, which is an obligation that could lead the United States to war. Democratic Senator Clark asked Senate Majority Leader Barkley, "If President Roosevelt, his son, and key members of the U.S. Army and Navy were on the British warship Prince of Wales when it was bombed, would that not be an act of war? Does the President intend to place himself in a position that could lead to an act of war?" Barkley replied that when the U.S. President is on a British warship and a U.S. warship is docked next to it, if enemy aircraft or warships bomb or destroy the British warship, it would cause great shock to the American people and create a difficult situation for a certain foreign country. If boarding a British warship is risky, the President is willing to take the risk in order to provide the world with a joint declaration that results from it.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Standard Outline for Two-Year Short-Term Elementary School Curriculum</h3>
<p>Focusing on National Consciousness and National Concepts</p>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) In order to implement compulsory education and cultivate healthy citizens, the Ministry of Education, in addition to announcing the Provisional Regulations for Two-Year Short-Term Elementary Schools, has also formulated and announced the Standard Outline for the Two-Year Short-Term Elementary School Curriculum.

<p>(2) To develop essential hygiene habits for life.</p>
<p>(2) To cultivate a love for the country and revive national consciousness. (4) To develop basic knowledge and skills necessary for life. (5) To cultivate the spirit of labor and aesthetic interests.</p>
<p>2.

<p>3. Teaching Subjects: The teaching subjects of two-year short-term elementary schools are civic training (including hygiene habits), Chinese (including phonetic symbols, reading, speaking, writing, and calligraphy), general knowledge (including social, natural, and hygiene knowledge), arithmetic (including written calculation and abacus), work (including labor and art), and singing (including physical education and singing).</p>
<p>4. Time Allocation: The weekly teaching time for each subject in two-year short-term elementary schools is allocated as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Civic Training: 60 minutes in the first and second year.

<p>Explanation: (1) Civic training focuses on individual training at ordinary times. The time listed in the table is for group training. (2) Time for self-study and extracurricular sports may be allocated after class each day, but should not exceed 60 minutes at most. (3) If a two-part teaching system is implemented, the direct teaching time and automatic homework time of each class should be allocated properly. If a half-day two-part teaching system is implemented, the number of direct teaching hours may be appropriately reduced. (4) The allocation of teaching time for each subject should be based on 20 minutes per session in principle, and may be extended to 45 or 60 minutes depending on the nature of the subject.</p>
<p>5.

(2) The compilation of teaching materials for each subject should be based on psychological principles and supplemented by logical principles. (3) The teaching materials for each subject should be described in vernacular Chinese, and the vocabulary used should be mainly those commonly needed in daily life. (4) Chinese teaching materials should pay attention to the cultivation of national consciousness and national concepts on the one hand, and should be based on children's actual lives on the other hand, fully considering children's reading ability and interest. (5) General knowledge teaching materials should pay attention to national and livelihood needs on the one hand, and should pay attention to the universal nature and practicality of the teaching materials themselves on the other hand. Their compilation should be closely linked to Chinese teaching materials. (6) Arithmetic teaching materials should adopt a mixed compilation of written calculation and abacus. (7) Civic training should formulate items according to the social environment and the needs of children's lives in each locality and implement them seriously. (8) Work teaching materials should mainly be related to local production and specialties. (9) Singing should focus on games and basic exercises. In rural areas, climbing mountains, walking, and field work can be used instead. Songs can use local popular songs with educational value and interest, and local popular musical instruments can be used as auxiliary teaching aids. (10) In addition to the textbooks compiled by the Ministry, each locality may compile supplementary teaching materials themselves.</p>
<p>6. Teaching Methods: The teaching methods for each subject in two-year short-term elementary schools should pay attention to the following points: (1) The teaching of each subject should pay close attention to practical application, and children should acquire a full understanding and practice of the knowledge and skills necessary for daily life and suitable for the special needs of the local society. (2) Speaking and reading texts during teaching should use standard Mandarin or a common language close to standard Mandarin. (3) Teaching should focus on arousing students' existing experience and stimulating learning interest. (4) The teaching method should emphasize the heuristic question-and-answer style.

<h3>After the Stabilization Fund Sets New Exchange Rates, Settlement Methods Have Been Established</h3>
<p>Nine Designated Chinese and Foreign Banks to Handle; British Commissioners to Supervise Implementation in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Stabilization Fund Committee announced new exchange rates on the 18th, allowing certain banks to settle and sell foreign exchange for legitimate trade, the value of the legal tender has risen. Chinese and foreign merchants have benefited from this, and morale has been greatly boosted. It is widely believed that this move by the Committee has significant political and economic implications. At the request of the Chinese government, the United States and the United Kingdom simultaneously froze Chinese funds to help the Chinese government control exchange rates, manage trade, and prevent funds from falling into Japanese hands, thereby eliminating speculative activities. The aforementioned objectives have now been initiated and are being put into action with considerable success.</p>
<p>Additional British Commissioners to Work in Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation in Shanghai and to regularly adopt countermeasures to address the foreign exchange issues in the Shanghai market, the Stabilization Fund Committee, in addition to Dr. Taylor, who is currently in Shanghai assisting, to continue researching and collecting relevant information, will also send a newly appointed Commissioner, E.L. Hall Patch, to Shanghai in the short term. Mr. Hall Patch is the British Far East Financial Counselor. He was asked to succeed Mr. Rogers, the original Commissioner, who was transferred to Hong Kong as an economic advisor to the government. His mission to Shanghai includes five points: (1) to liaise with the authorities of Allied Banks and National Banks in Shanghai and instruct them on the decisions and countermeasures of the Stabilization Fund; (2) to study the effectiveness of the British and American freezing orders and minimize loopholes as much as possible; (3) to supervise the implementation of the designated banks in Shanghai providing foreign exchange at the new exchange rates set by the Stabilization Fund; (4) to analyze the import and export trade situation in Shanghai, prevent exporters from freely selling foreign exchange, and prevent importers from requesting foreign exchange for non-essential goods; (5) to investigate the situation of Chinese legal tender and price fluctuations in Shanghai and the occupied areas, and strive to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on prices.</p>
<p>Nine Banks Ordered to Handle</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency made a special visit to a senior official of the Bank of China yesterday afternoon to inquire about everything. He explained in detail that the Stabilization Fund Committee has specifically authorized only nine banks to provide foreign exchange at the new exchange rates: US$5.34375 and GB£3 3/16 per Spanish dollar, for those engaged in legitimate import trade with China. These banks are: (1) British: HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, Australia and China, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; (2) American: Citibank, Chase Bank; (3) Chinese: Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China. The other nine banks listed in General Ruling No. 55 of the United States, designated as having special privileges to operate foreign exchange business, such as (1) American Allied Banking Corporation, ____, (1) Soviet Moscow Narodny Bank, (3) British: Sassoon Banking Corporation, David Sassoon &amp; Co., E.D. Sassoon &amp; Co., Sassoon Trading Co.; (4) Dutch: Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, are not included.</p>
<p>Restricted to the Sterling Area</p>
<p>The settlement and sale of this foreign exchange must meet the requirements of General Ruling No. 58: (1) It must be a bona fide import trade, and the amount applied for must be equal to the import value; (2) It must not be a trade operated or entrusted by a blocked country outside China or its people, or by the people of the three northeastern provinces; (3) It must not be a trade related to the interests of a blocked country outside China or its people, or the people of the three northeastern provinces; Second, the imported goods must come from the Sterling Area; Third, it must be an imported commodity not listed in the embargo regulations announced by the Chinese Customs authorities on July 4, 1939, and subsequently amended.</p>
<p>Advance Settlement, Retroactive Approval</p>
<p>Fourth, applicants must provide supporting documents, such as bills of lading, invoices, and transportation documents, to prove that it is not a speculative act. Fifth, after the above nine banks accept the application and pass the review, they can grant the advance settlement of foreign exchange, but reserve two weeks. Within this period, the Hong Kong office or agent of each bank shall submit a triplicate application form to the Hong Kong office of the Stabilization Fund, and then submit it to the Chongqing Stabilization Fund for approval. If the Committee believes that it violates the embargo regulations, the foreign exchange settled must be sold again.</p>
<p>Rice and Coal Issues Still Need Instructions</p>
<p>Regarding whether the rice and coal needed in the Shanghai concession area can be settled at the new exchange rate, it is said that (1) the embargo regulations issued by the Chinese Customs authorities have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the specific provisions are unknown; (2) since the imported goods must come from the Sterling Area to be settled at the new exchange rate, the rice and coal imported into Shanghai are not entirely from the Sterling Area, as evidenced by Vietnam, and foreign exchange cannot be obtained at this favorable exchange rate. This issue still needs to be referred for instructions. The external statement that it can be supplied according to the new exchange rate is not true.</p>
<p>Embargoed Goods Divided into Twelve Categories</p>
<p>Regarding the embargo regulations announced by the Chinese Customs authorities on July 4, 1939, although there have been several revisions since then, the initial announcement is still the basis. According to investigations by Da Zhong News Agency, the embargoed goods are divided into a total of twelve categories and 160 items. Due to space limitations, only the category names are listed below: (1) Cotton and cotton fabrics; (2) Flax, ramie, hemp, jute, and their products; (3) Wool and its products; (4) Silk and its products; (5) Food, beverages, and herbal medicines; (6) Tobacco; (7) Candles, soap, fats, waxes, glues, and rosin; (8) Books, maps, and paper; (9) Raw and processed animal materials and their products (such as leather, pig bristles, horsehair, ivory, etc. are all included); (10) Wood, lumber, bamboo, rattan, grass, and their products; (11) Porcelain, enamel, glass, and other items; (12) Miscellaneous (such as amber, coral, tortoiseshell and their products, antiques, curios, lacquerware, metal ornaments, fans, phonographs, jewelry, etc.).</p>
<p>Official Announcement to Be Released Soon</p>
<p>The Times reports that the Stabilization Fund Committee's order to help merchants of democratic countries obtain favorable exchange rates is still awaiting detailed news. According to HSBC officials, "The official announcement on this matter may be released within the next two days." The Chongqing government's list of prohibited imports was first published in July 1939 and has been revised several times since. It is generally expected that the latest revision will be released soon. Bank and money industry officials suggested that the current difficulty in purchasing foreign exchange, even for legal imports, will continue until detailed information is released in Hong Kong or Chongqing.</p>
<p>Current Transactions are Few</p>
<p>The China Press reports that yesterday (19th), import merchants in this city still did not know how to conduct legitimate trade, but in general, the situation yesterday was not much different from Monday (18th). Import trade from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Sterling Area, and the Dutch East Indies is within the scope of the new regulations announced by the Stabilization Fund Committee. All import trade must be proven to be legitimate before it can be settled at the new exchange rate. Therefore, yesterday (19th), the number of transactions based on the new exchange rate was very small. Another fact that has greatly inconvenienced legitimate import trade is that only a few people have obtained a list of prohibited imports. This list is published on page 139 of the July 1939 issue of the British Chamber of Commerce Journal.</p>
<h3>Accumulated Water in the Western District Has Not Receded; Public Transportation Is Blocked</h3>
<p>The recent heavy rains continued for days, coupled with higher tides, causing low-lying roads to become swamps. Yesterday, the weather was gloomy, with occasional light rain in the autumn wind. By the afternoon, there was a slight glimpse of sunshine. In the heart of the concession area, the accumulated water had receded. In the western district of the International Settlement, sections of roads such as Jing'an Temple Road, Moorehead Road, Hart Road, Haig Road, Foch Road, Connaught Road, and Xiaosha Ferry Road still had accumulated water. In the French Concession, the water on Avenue Joffre had receded, and the trams had resumed operation. However, areas such as the northern end of Route Tenant de la Tour, Route Paul Henry, and Avenue Albert were still flooded. On the western outskirts of Shanghai, roads such as Avenue Haig, Route Zicawei, Route Lafayette, Route Pottier, and Great Western Road had not seen any decrease in the water level. The water on Route Lafayette was waist-deep, and it is predicted that it will be difficult to recede completely within a day or two. Yesterday, the No. 10 Red Plate bus traveling from Avenue Edward VII to Duncin Road was also suspended due to water obstruction. Only the No. 14 White Plate bus continued to operate to Route Lafayette. The No. 2 bus traveling to Anhe Temple Road still maintained traffic through the water. All other vehicles traveling to the western district of Shanghai terminated at Jing'an Temple.</p>
<h3>Original Business Tax Plan Amended; Incorporated into House Rate Collection</h3>
<p>Renamed Business House Rate Special Additional Tax</p>
<p>Complex Procedures Mean Implementation Not Immediate</p>
<p>Regarding the International Settlement's plan to levy a business tax, the Public Works Bureau's Finance Committee met on the afternoon of the 18th at 4:30 PM in the Public Works Bureau conference room to review the plan. It is reported that the original plan has been amended, renaming it the Business House Rate Special Additional Tax. It was also decided to submit this amendment to the Public Works Bureau meeting for a final decision. This tax is essentially a type of business income tax. In order to be legal, it will be changed to a type of house rate and clearly stipulated. In the future, there will be considerable restrictions on various business activities to ensure that taxes cannot be evaded. As for the contents of this tax, according to the investigation, it is roughly as follows: the new tax is levied based on the assessed value of business premises and is divided into two levels: Level A includes various offices, shops, factories, warehouses, docks, and other general business premises; Level B includes various exchanges. The Level A tax rate is 8% per year for houses with an assessed value exceeding $3,000. The Level B tax rate is 15% per year for houses with an assessed value exceeding $3,000. The total annual revenue is approximately $7 million. (The method of calculating the tax and the tax rates are roughly similar to the business tax currently levied in the French Concession.) This plan will be submitted for discussion as soon as the Public Works Bureau's holiday ends on the 3rd of next month. However, this tax is a new creation and still needs to go through various procedures, so its implementation may be delayed until January of next year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Affected by Freezing Order; Silk Market Turns</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that as a result of the U.S. freezing Chinese and Japanese funds, the situation in the Shanghai silk market has completely changed. Before the freezing order was issued, the Japanese tried their best to prevent non-Japanese exporters from obtaining silk in Central China in order to transport it to New York for sale themselves. However, the Japanese are eager to avoid the risk of being frozen, so they would rather sell raw silk to other firms in this city. According to Japanese newspapers in this city, the Japanese Central China Silk Company has received instructions not to export raw silk to the United States, but can sell it to non-Japanese exporters in this city at will. Therefore, in the past two weeks, the Japanese have sold a large amount of raw silk from Central China to Shanghai's Chinese, British, American, and other exporters. It is reported that the liner President Coolidge carried no less than 6,000 bales of silk from this port to the United States last week.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Train Derailment at Double Bridge on the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway</h3>
<p>Dozens of Yards of Track Destroyed; Dozens of Passengers Injured</p>
<p>According to people from Suzhou yesterday, another train derailment occurred on the middle section of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway the night before. It is reported that at around 2:55 PM the day before, a passenger train departing from Suzhou for Jiaxing derailed at around 5:00 PM near Double Bridge, north of Wangjiangjing and south of Jiaxing, because dozens of yards of track had been destroyed. One locomotive overturned into the river. It is rumored that dozens of passengers were injured. The Japanese are currently rushing to repair the tracks.</p>
<h3>French Ships Between Shanghai and Vietnam Increase Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Increase of 15%; Passenger Fares Not Increased</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired with the French Navigation Company yesterday and learned the new freight rates for general cargo between Shanghai and Vietnam: (1) The freight rate from Shanghai to Haiphong increased from HK$28 to HK$33 per ton; (2) The freight rate from Shanghai to Saigon increased from HK$31 to HK$36 per ton, an increase of 15%. According to the company's staff, the implementation date of the above-mentioned new freight rates will be after the departure of the Benares on the 23rd of this month and the departure of the General Joffre on the 24th. The freight rates for the company's ships sailing from Manila to Shanghai have already increased by 20% last week. The passenger fares for all ships belonging to the company will not be increased. It is also learned that the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam has been very prosperous recently, so the shipping industry has been very developed. In addition to the General Joffre, there are three more ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month: (1) The Kindian arrives on the 24th; The Kaiting arrives on the 27th; The Ganquinnan arrives on the 29th. Each ship carries a large amount of rice and coal. The goods carried by the ships sailing to Vietnam are mostly cloth.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Domestic Postage Increase; Shanghai Post Office Has Not Received Clear Orders</h3>
<p>Domestic postage rates were increased once last year, and there is now a rumor that domestic postage rates will be increased again starting September 1. A reporter from Da Tong News Agency inquired with the person in charge of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday morning and learned that the bureau has not yet received a clear order from the General Post Office to increase rates and cannot make a decision. However, judging from the recent increase in prices, increasing postage rates is a reasonable measure and there is nothing wrong with it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesperson Denies That American Nationals Are Being Detained as Hostages</h3>
<p>More Japanese Nationals in the United States Than American Nationals in Japan</p>
<p>American Nationals Can Now Come to Shanghai to Return Home</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Hori, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, stated yesterday (19th) afternoon when meeting with reporters that American nationals would not be detained in Japan as hostages as rumored. Although he had not received official information on this matter, the Reuters report had reported that American nationals in Japan could come to Shanghai. With this opening, the plan to "detain nationals as hostages" could not exist. If Japan took this measure, the blow to itself would be heavier than to the United States because there were far more Japanese nationals in the United States than American nationals in Japan. As far as he knew, the Japanese side had never implemented any restrictions prohibiting American nationals from coming to Shanghai from Japan. The "closed door" policy recently adopted by the Japanese in Japan, prohibiting foreigners who have not obtained special permits from entering or leaving, is not retaliation for the U.S. and British freezing orders. This new method had been considered for some time and was officially implemented on August 15.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: This Session's Undertaking Successfully Completed</h3>
<p>Donations from All Circles Suspended from Today; Donations Still Hopeful for Enthusiastic Contributions When Winter Session Resumes</p>
<p>Total Donations Amounted to $54,204.01</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, it has been misguidedly supported by all sectors of society. Within 38 days, the fund has raised more than $54,000. The number of people coming to the office to donate in the scorching heat every day is still very enthusiastic. From this, we can see the earnest expectations of the people in society for young students and the widespread promotion of the human spirit of mutual assistance. This kind of invaluable social heat has prompted the staff of this newspaper to work diligently and carefully on scholarship fund matters, which is profound and significant. At the same time, the sympathy and encouragement that the recipient students have received from society should inspire them to be more grateful and vigilant. Now that the schools are about to open, the quota for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund for this period has also been reviewed and finalized by the gentlemen of the committee and will be announced one after another. The scholarship funds will also be distributed within the next few days. All the procedures for this period will be explained in detail by the staff in accordance with the decisions and instructions of the committee. We hope that people from all walks of life and the gentlemen of the readers who generously donated funds will provide guidance and we will be grateful.</p>
<p>Donations for This Period Suspended</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of all sectors of society in donating this time, with some saving on food and clothing, some diverting entertainment expenses, some using business income, and some generously contributing out of sincerity, including banks, companies, pharmaceutical factories, firms, and social elites, men and women from all walks of life, workers, and children, have all been enthusiastic in helping. In addition, people carried money to the office in the sweltering heat. This kind of spirit is commendable. Now that the scholarship quota for this period has been reviewed and finalized and is sufficient to meet the needs of all students who have applied, this newspaper has decided that, except for the gentlemen who have confirmed monthly donations, it will stop accepting donations for the Readers' Scholarship Fund from today. There are many people who are enthusiastically helping with education and are continuing to donate generously. The staff of this newspaper believe that the organization of an event should have a clear sense of procedure. When the second period (winter) continues to be handled, we will announce it again and ask for the donations of readers. The staff will also take this period of suspension of donations to shift their efforts to pay attention to the academic progress of the recipient students in order to live up to the initial wishes of the readers who donated to the scholarship fund. We hope that people from all walks of life will understand our intentions.</p>
<p>Income and Expenditure Accounts to Be Released Soon</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the total amount of scholarship donations received from all sectors of society was $54,204.01. The approved quotas and amounts for university, vocational school, middle school, and elementary school students who applied this time have all been decided by the two committees. However, because the list of students approved for scholarships has not been fully announced and the funds are still to be collected, and the committee has decided that the educational funds for three disaster-stricken children and the funds for after-school tutoring requested by workers and businessmen should be allocated. Once all the procedures are completed, the amount of the remaining funds will be announced in detail and stored in a designated bank for use in supplementing the scholarship fund for the final period.</p>
<p>University Quota to Be Disclosed Tomorrow</p>
<p>The list of all students approved for scholarships, except for the elementary school section, which was published in this newspaper on the 15th, and the middle school students, which started to be published yesterday, has been repeatedly inquired by the applying students, which is due to the limited space of this newspaper and the inability to publish all of them on the same day. It is expected that the approved list of high school students will be fully announced on the 22nd. We also hope that the approved students will apply in person or be accompanied by their parents to the office to collect checks from the 25th of this month so that the staff of this newspaper can complete the procedures for the Readers' Scholarship Fund for this period as scheduled. As for those who the committee believes can be funded but need to be re-examined or submit additional documents, as well as the four free students, they will be announced after the review procedures are completed.</p>
<p>Comrades of Foreign Firm Collect Funds to Help Students</p>
<p>A letter from the comrades of the Moo Foo Foreign Firm reads, "Dear Sirs, recently, we read in your newspaper that you are organizing a scholarship fund, which not only benefits poor students, but also cultivates talents for the country and society. We, the comrades, uphold the principle of human mutual assistance and contribute to the best of our ability. We have collected a total of $200. We know that a drop in the bucket is limited, but the beneficiaries are limited, but every little bit helps, and we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will enthusiastically support it, and it will definitely be effective." Also, a letter from Mr. Ling Yongxiang of Universal Wireless Telegraph Company reads, "I had a new grandson last week. At this time of turmoil, I cannot bear to be extravagant, so I have allocated 50 legal currency from the expenses for the happy eggs to be sent to relatives and friends to donate to the scholarship fund. When the full month is over, I will save more on banquets and continue to offer it." The enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>Total of More Than $54,000</p>
<p>The gentlemen who donated yesterday are as follows: Mr. Wang Nianzu $100, Mr. Wang Nianzi $100, Mr. Zhao Peiwen $50, Zhenhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory $50, Mr. Ling Yongxiang (saving happy eggs for adding a grandson) $50, Mr. Zhang Tifang $30, comrades of Moo Foo Foreign Firm $200, (Ling Jinyuan $40, Zai Xuchun $30, Qian Qinghao $20, Chong Deyao $20, Xi Shunxing $20, Dai Gongbei $10, Xie Kaichun $10, Lu Junyao $10, Han Shichang $10, Bao Yongyun $5, Han Huilian $5, Wang Changjian $5, Miss Wang $5, Wang Bin $5, Yan Fulin $3, Chen Deming $2, Si Dongjun (manuscript fee) $8.50, Huang Songbai, a third-year student of Danhua Elementary School, $3, Qian Tinglian $1, a total of $592.50, previously deposited $53,611.51, for a total of $54,204.01. From today, donations from all sectors of society will be stopped.</p>

<h3>American Freighter "Alexander" Released</h3>
<p>Heard the reason for the detention was due to exceeding the draft limit.</p>
<p>The American President Lines freighter "Alexander" sailed from San Francisco Bay to Shanghai on the 16th of this month. After the ship entered, it had just passed the water barrier of the blockade line in Nanshi when it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy. After negotiations, the Japanese Navy released the ship on the afternoon of the 19th and allowed it to continue exporting. It is said that the reason for the detention was that the ship's draft exceeded the 7-meter limit, which hindered navigation. According to sources from the American President Lines, the ship had recently been ordered to come to Shanghai to participate in cargo transportation. It had been serving in San Francisco Bay. After arriving in Shanghai on the 16th, the ship docked at the Laoda Lai Shipping Company wharf to unload cargo, which led to the detention by the Japanese side. After being released, the ship originally planned to leave Shanghai empty on a certain day, but due to heavy rain, the sailing date was postponed.</p>
<h3>Increased Electricity Rates Affect Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that Shanghai business people believe that since the Shanghai Municipal Council has approved the Shanghai Power Company to increase electricity rates for electricity usage exceeding the allocated amount, the prices of products in this city may increase significantly as a result. The reason is that most manufacturers here will likely continue to use the same amount of electricity as usual and increase the selling prices of their products to cope with the rise in electricity rates. This is because many factories cannot continue to operate if they reduce their electricity consumption due to the extremely high excess electricity rates.</p>
<h3>American Court Counselor Luden Reappointed for Four Years</h3>
<p>Nelson E. Lnston, Counselor of the United States Court for China, upon the order of Judge Helmick of the Court, has been reappointed for four years and was sworn into office at the court the day before yesterday. Mr. Luden has served in this position three times. He first served as Counselor of the Court from 1918 until he resigned in 1927 to partner with lawyer Mr. Hall in a private law firm. He was reappointed to this position in 1937. The original term was scheduled to expire the day before yesterday. Because Judge Helmick took leave to return to the United States, and someone was needed to take care of court affairs, Mr. Helmick telegraphed from Washington requesting a reappointment. After Mr. Helmick left Shanghai, Mr. Luden acted as an agent in civil and criminal cases, but important cases still await Mr. Helmick's personal trial after he returns to Shanghai. For example, the recent case of Sheriff Taylor Bauer of the Court involved in corruption. Unless the American government appoints a special judge to handle the case, it must wait until Mr. Helmick comes to Shanghai before the trial can begin.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Costs Should Be Thoroughly Investigated by Authorities</h3>
<p>Prices Raised Arbitrarily Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The Coal Briquette Industry Association issued a rebuttal yesterday against the seven major coal briquette factories, including Yi Tai Xing and Nanyang, for withdrawing from the association, and issued a public notice to all sectors, pointing out that the withdrawal was without any reason. The ten factories, including Yi Tai Xing and Nanyang, also published their costs in the newspaper and changed their selling prices. According to the order of the French Concession Police Department, the retail price of coal briquettes is set at 16.6 yuan per dan. Now these factories have increased it to 17.2 yuan, causing a public outcry. The French authorities will thoroughly investigate. The manufacturing costs and raw material figures published by these factories are much higher than those calculated and published by the association, which further arouses public alarm. The coal dross used by the factories are all stockpiled goods with very low costs.</p>
<h3>Redemption of Debt and Payment of Interest Handled by Hong Kong Banks</h3>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has ordered chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions to allocate funds from the national treasury revenue for the principal and interest due on the public bonds of 500 million national currency issued on September 1, 1937, and deposit them in special accounts in the Central Bank and the Bank of China for payment. Bondholders are requested to collect the due principal and interest from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and their branches in various regions starting from August 31. The first interest coupon will be payable from August 31, 1938, and the three-year payment period will end on August 31, 1941. Bondholders who have not collected the interest are urged to do so before the deadline; payments will be stopped after the deadline. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications yesterday that due to environmental reasons, the Shanghai branches of these three banks will temporarily not handle payments. Bondholders are requested to collect the principal and interest from the Hong Kong branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Those who wish to collect the principal and interest should first obtain an application form, fill it out, and attach the winning bond or the interest coupon due to request payment.</p>
<h3>No Need to Obtain Permits for Shipping Goods to Syria</h3>
<p>British Embassy Announces</p>
<p>The British Embassy announced last night (the 19th) that from now on, there is no need to obtain British naval permits for shipping goods to Syria and Lebanon, except for those passing through Iran or Iraq. However, shippers should note that the authorities in Syria and Lebanon have implemented strict import permit systems, and the British naval permit only indicates that the British government does not object to the goods being shipped to the Persian Gulf, and does not mean that it has been allowed to be imported into those two places, or that no import permit is required. According to the British announcement on August 19, Syria and Lebanon are no longer occupied territories.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Concentrated in the Philippines to Withdraw to Shanghai Aboard the "General Chaffee"</h3>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai Delayed by One Day Due to Fog at Sea Dutch Ship "Zeeshan" Sails Today</p>
<p>The French postal ship "General Chaffee" will take a route from Haiphong and Saigon through Manila to Shanghai. When docking at the port of Little Luzon, it will carry 400 Japanese nationals concentrated in the Philippines from various parts of Southeast Asia to withdraw to Japan via Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday and was scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf. There are also 83 other passengers who boarded the ship in Haiphong to come to Shanghai. In addition to 150 tons of cargo,</p>
<p>there are also 5,000 bags of tribute rice, which were also transported to this place by the "General Chaffee." However, the ship had not entered port as of last night. It is said that due to bad weather and fog at sea, the voyage was delayed and is expected to arrive today. It is also learned that the Dutch ship "Zeeshan" arrived in Shanghai last Saturday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan today. It will return to Shanghai again next week and then return to the East Indies.</p>

<h3>Case of Abduction and Murder of Copper Factory Owner by Snatching Hua Police</h3>
<p>The Culprit Recovers from Injury and is Brought to Trial</p>
<p>Jin Huating, a native of Shaoxing and the owner of the Hujiang Copper Factory at 1200 Hart Road, was at work in his office at noon on June 4 of this year when his brother-in-law, Lu Renlin, together with three accomplices, brandished a handgun, made threatening noises, and handcuffed Jin, dragging him out of the factory gate and pushing him into a car with a forged pass, number 359 (military vehicle license). The car sped towards Hart Road on Route Robertsone in western Shanghai. There, they happened to encounter Hua Police officers No. 1062, No. 632, No. 901, No. 693, and No. 912, who glimpsed someone in the car</p>
<p>crying out for help.</p>
<p>They ordered the car to stop, but the car did not comply. Hua Police officer No. 632 pulled up the barbed wire fence to obstruct the car. In desperation, the group stopped the car, and the victim, Jin Huating, got out of the car one after another and fled separately. The Hua Police officers chased after them, and the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. As a result, Hua Police officer No. 632 was shot in a vital area and fell to the ground, dead. The remaining police officers were slightly injured. The driver of the bandit's car, Ma Songtao, a native of Ningbo, was also shot in the leg and captured on the spot. The victim, Jin Huating, was</p>
<p>rescued from danger and returned to the factory. Bandit Ma was taken to the police station and transferred to the police hospital for treatment. He only recovered the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special First Court, where Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Kong Guangxiao, who were handling the case, brought him to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution on charges of kidnapping and murder, stating that the mastermind behind the case was Jin's brother-in-law, Lu Renlin, because he had previously borrowed 5,000 yuan from Jin but was not granted the loan. Later, he wrote</p>
<p>threatening letters, but Lu and the three other escaped kidnappers could not be apprehended. He requested an extension. The victim, Jin Huating, was not present and was represented by factory workers Zhao Ruichu and Shen Jiting, who testified to the situation of Lu Renlin and three bandits entering the factory to kidnap him. The judge, Jiang Shuzi, questioned the defendant, who gave evasive answers, and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>
<h3>Xinqiao Street Iron Gate Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The iron gate on Xinqiao Street, which borders the French Concession's Nine Acres area in Nanshi, was originally scheduled to open on the 19th after being approved by the Japanese military authorities in Nanshi. However, it was not opened due to the lack of approval from the French Concession authorities. The details have been recorded in newspapers for days. The Japanese side notified the French Concession authorities on the tenth of the month, and the French Concession Police Department dispatched police officers to implement the opening at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, allowing residents of the north and south cities to travel freely. The time remains the same as before, from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Dishonest Weigher Beats Vegetable Vendor to Death</h3>
<p>Husband and Wife Both Beaten to Death</p>
<p>Zhang Liangdi, a local resident, lived at 22 Hejia Pavilion behind Guanghua University on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai and was a vegetable vendor by trade. On the day before yesterday (the 18th), at 6:00 a.m., Zhang, as usual, accompanied his wife, Zhang Wang (45 years old), to the Central Market's Xuhui branch on Hongqiao Road to buy vegetables to sell in Shanghai, hoping to make a small profit to make a living. At that time, they selected several catties of green chili peppers, which were priced at three yuan. Zhang only had 2.8 yuan on him, lacking 0.2 yuan, so he negotiated with the weigher, Xu Deyuan, that he could make up the difference the next day. Xu refused, and an argument ensued. Xu then brutally beat Zhang, seriously injuring him. Zhang collapsed to the ground, barely breathing. His wife, Wang, was shocked to see this and cried out for help, but she was also beaten to the ground by Xu and fainted. Other vegetable vendors rose up in protest and called for a car to send the Zhang couple to the hospital for treatment. Zhang died soon after due to his serious injuries, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Zhang's wife, Wang, also died of her serious injuries at noon yesterday. The assailant, Xu Deyuan, has also been detained.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen Association to Organize Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>In recent years, as the cost of living index has continued to increase, even eating has become a concern. The education of children is naturally even more difficult to solve. The number of young people dropping out of school is increasing day by day, and aspiring young people are being excluded from schools. This is a major loss. The Zhenjiang Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, recognizing this, has recently begun to organize a scholarship fund. It has specially hired fellow townsmen Chen Peide, Yao Hanbin, Hu Chunlin, Zhou Daoqian, Wu Yunzhai, Zhang Haicheng, Li Hongshou, Liu Tanlin, Yang Chong, Yin Huanzhi, Li Wenjie, and Chen Rongfa to serve as members of the scholarship fund committee and manage the affairs. The estimated scholarship amount is 6,000 yuan per semester, which will be donated separately by the committee members and enthusiastic fellow townsmen who care about education. The accounting for this fund will be independent and managed by a commissioner recommended by the committee. The distribution of the scholarship will be divided into three parts: high school, junior high school, and elementary school. High school students will receive a scholarship of 80 yuan per semester per student, junior high school students will receive a scholarship of 60 yuan per semester per student, and elementary school students will receive a scholarship of 20 yuan per semester per student. The application registration period for this semester is from August 18 to September 5. Application requirements: (1) Must be a student from Zhenjiang; (2) Must be from a truly poor family; (3) Must be of excellent character and academic performance. Those who meet the above three requirements can bring two 2.5-inch photos of themselves to the association's office at 3 Zhifu Road (intersection of Zhejiang Road), second floor, to obtain a registration form and apply for registration, and attach a transcript from the most recent semester. After the registration procedures are completed, staff will be sent to investigate and conduct interviews, and the list of approved scholarship recipients will be announced before September 10. Any young students from Zhenjiang who are studying in Shanghai and meet the above requirements can go to register. Members of the Zhenjiang Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association who are aware of outstanding students who are ambitious but unable to attend school can introduce them to the association to apply for registration.</p>

<h3>The Merits of the Bomber</h3>
<p>— Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>"The merits of the bomber?" You might say with indignation and hatred, "Killing people is the merit of the bomber! Flesh and blood are blurred, limbs are broken, people are killed like hemp, and cities are turned into ruins. These are the merits of the bomber!"</p>
<p>Your words are certainly correct, but wait, what I want to talk about is another kind of merit of the bomber, the merit of the bomber saving people.</p>
<p>It was at the end of 1935 that Mount Loa, the big volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, suddenly became active, with thick smoke and flames soaring into the sky. In a few weeks, the lava torrent became a river, and it had the potential to flow towards Hilo, the second largest port in Hawaii. At that time, the American volcanologist Dr. Xia Jia was closely monitoring the situation, paying attention to the volcano's activity and the direction of the lava flow. He noted that if the lava continued to flow east, the 20,000 residents of Hilo would have to abandon tens of millions of dollars worth of property and flee within two weeks, or they would be buried in the lava.</p>
<p>At this time, the situation was very tense. To save the 20,000 residents of Hilo and preserve their livelihoods, the only way was to find a way to stop or divert the lava flow. At this critical moment, Dr. Xia Jia had a flash of inspiration and came up with the only solution, which was to ask the army authorities to send bombers to bomb the crater.</p>
<p>The authorities agreed, first sending reconnaissance planes to observe the volcanic situation, then dropping test bombs, and finally five bombers taking turns dropping twenty 600-pound bombs into the crater. As a result, the speed of the lava flow gradually decreased, and after thirty-three hours, the lava completely stopped flowing, and three days later, the eruption of Mount Loa also stopped. Thus, the bomber saved the lives of 20,000 residents.</p>
<p>Not only is science innocent, but bombers are also innocent!</p>

<h3>The Future of the White-Clad Angel</h3>
<p>— Feile</p>
<p>"I am a prisoner of the universe."</p>
<p>"Even beggars are stronger than me."</p>
<p>"I'd rather die than do this ghost's work in a white cap."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>A series of curses erupted from the mouth of the white-clad angel.</p>
<p>If you knew, you would sympathize with her without reservation, nodding at her every complaint.</p>
<p>Yes, Florence Nightingale is great. Her spirit of "self-sacrifice" is worthy of our eternal admiration! But she would never have imagined that in some corner of this time and place, there would actually be a cry of "Save the nurses."</p>
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that Xian admired Florence Nightingale; at least, this starched "white cap," this strangely pleasing "Nurse," this slogan of "serving the people" had truly become the center of her fascination.</p>
<p>She entered this "Advanced Nursing School" like a little bird, or perhaps it was paradise for Xian.</p>
<p>She had quickly learned to make cotton balls, tear plaster, make beds, take temperatures, and count pulses.</p>
<p>She also knew how to ask patients, "How many bowel movements?"</p>
<p>Continuing, she could even mix petroleum jelly, measure units, dab boric acid solution, and administer enemas.</p>
<p>From six o'clock to six o'clock, from dawn to dusk, from the restroom to the outpatient department, she devoted her legs to their career.</p>
<p>"This is basic work!"</p>
<p>She remembered the dean's words, and she endured her fatigue. Although, she was somewhat anxious that she had not yet started the "Two Essential Nursing Books" and "Pediatric Nursing."</p>
<p>Although she hadn't taken classes yet, Xian's practical work had already entered the "honorary class" – she could already write "Sleep well" on the patient's chart. This was the dean's "promotion."</p>
<p>The dean made his rounds, bringing two pretty students with him, rewarding them with lipstick – yes, this was "giving patients a pleasant impression."</p>
<p>Xian was assigned to the "private room." The dean was particularly "eager to please" the first-class patient, and he instructed Xian "to be good."</p>
<p>"What a beautiful young lady, what's your name?" He even stroked Xian's dimple.</p>
<p>The dean did not accept Xian's protest. His intention was that nurses should obligingly accept the patient's teasing – no, "to give patients spiritual comfort."</p>
<p>Xian wondered, "Is this a product of Nightingale's 'self-sacrifice' principle?"</p>
<p>After some time, Xian also read two chapters of "Pharmacology." Then, she was also transferred to the "dispensing room."</p>
<p>Dispensing medicine was like this:</p>
<p>Soda powder plus red pigment was "oral medication," and distilled water injected into "Ampoules" was a "supplemental shot."</p>
<p>"There's even better!" The dean exchanged the patient's money for the tonics and injections. But his explanation was: "This is psychological therapy, it's the latest."</p>
<p>"Fei, I don't need to tell you any more embarrassing things about the dean and the nurses, anyway, the nurses must 'sacrifice,' 'give of themselves,' even sacrifice like Miss Xia."</p>
<p>"No, I don't admit that nurses have no future."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! My future is either the doctor's concubine or a perpetual spinster!"</p>
<p>Xian's words were quite serious, and even her attitude was exerting a will. I was surprised that this little bird would turn into an eagle-like coldness.</p>
<p>"Don't be surprised at my transformation. The 'white cap' is a magic circle. It will turn liveliness into dullness, passion into ashes, and innocence into pretense!"</p>
<p>"The day I went in, I was laughing, then I was frowning, and now I've lit a fire."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Set a fire, to burn away the dark life!"</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>In the end, the white-clad angel still has a future.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but stroke the white cap on my head!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>

<p>Twelfth Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>"Being friends with a pus-filled sack like you is just bad luck! " Bald Liu said, propping his right leg on a bench, his sheepskin coat open, his thick black eyebrows turned upside down, his voice full of fury, almost wanting to pounce on Shang Laoer to fight.</p>
<p>Shang Laoer had just returned from Zhangshucun, sitting in the bedroom Liu Baldy had let him have, a room less than two zhang square. He looked very depressed.</p>
<p>"If the written agreement doesn't count, then what can be trusted?" Baldy Liu shouted several times in a desperate manner, unknowingly making his inverted round face, which was sharp on top and broad on the bottom, flush red; a short, fat body with this liver-colored round face looked, from seven or eight steps away, like a ripe pumpkin!</p>
<p>He saw that Shang Laoer was still silent and not speaking, and his anger rose even more.</p>
<p>"What is he anyway, does he not even acknowledge reason!" Even though Baldy Liu was a painted face on stage, in private he always liked to show off his coarse voice.</p>
<p>"Regardless of whether he was a star ten years ago or just a bit player, as long as his daughter kowtowed to you and studied acting, he has no right to interfere! Besides, the written agreement has been settled, so why can he go back on his word? It's amazing that you can still put up with this! Damn it, if you provoke me to take action, I'll either beat him to death or make him lie in bed for three years or so..."</p>
<p>"Old brother, don't be so impulsive. You haven't heard me finish yet!" Shang Laoer finally raised his head and said weakly.</p>
<p>"Finish? What else is there to say!" Baldy Liu asked, staring fiercely at the other party, as if he was angry with Shang Laoer. (190)</p>
<p>Military Preparations</p>
<h3>Training Anti-Aircraft Gunners</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>In order to train anti-aircraft gunners, the British military authorities have created a model aircraft that can slide back and forth on electric wires. The anti-aircraft gunners then aim with a "photo gun" so that when the aircraft enters the firing range of the anti-aircraft gun, they can turn the firing pin. This training method is both practical and saves ammunition and the consumption of model aircraft. Moreover, in rainy weather, it can also be moved indoors for training, without any difficulties or inconveniences. It is expected that these mass-produced anti-aircraft gunners will give a serious blow to aggressive enemies.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Tireless Effort</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>In the graduating class of 1941 at George Washington University in the United States, there was an elderly student, Mrs. Isabelle Barnes Haggett, who was seventy-eight years old; her spirit of tireless pursuit of knowledge is truly worthy of our emulation. She came to the United States eight years ago, and in order to do some work, she decided to go to college to study. She herself admitted that when she first started, it was difficult for her to compete with the young students. She wore dentures, which made it impossible to correct her original French accent; but she had a passion for learning, and no matter how bad the weather, she never missed a class, and finally graduated with third-class honors. Do readers think that she was finished after getting her bachelor's degree? No, no, according to her own account, she will continue to study European history in the fall to obtain a master's degree.</p>
<p>The so-called "learning knows no bounds," the so-called "learn until you are old, but you will never finish learning," after seeing such an example of "the older, the stronger," we certainly feel more and more the truth of these two sentences; what reason do we young people have to waste our studies and engage in absurd pastimes?</p>

<h3>Utilizing Time</h3>
<p>— Zhong Liang</p>
<p>The reason why the great French naturalist Lamarck became famous is by no means without reason.</p>
<p>Due to circumstances, Lamarck resolutely entered the military camp at the age of seventeen and galloped on the battlefield. Unfortunately, this young hero encountered an accident in less than four years. He was forced to go to Paris to recuperate. However, according to his condition, he had to quietly stay in bed for a year.</p>
<p>Lamarck's sickroom was a small attic. At this time, his suffering can be imagined. However, looking out from the only skylight in the entire room, the clouds floating back and forth in the sky aroused his interest. In his loneliness, Lamarck used his free time to do things that others considered meaningless. He categorized various clouds and judged their impact on the climate based on their shape and structure. For example, large black "rain clouds" would bring powdery white snow. Layered "cumulus clouds," if they appeared in the east, were a sign that the long summer heat was diminishing, and beautiful and thin "white cirrus clouds" could determine a clear weather.</p>
<p>Later, Lamarck finally recovered completely, and he could rejoin the army, but he could see all kinds of weather at a glance, so from then on, Lamarck devoted himself to natural history.</p>

<p>London's beautiful neon lights were all turned off when the war broke out. But they now have "wartime work."</p>
<p>It turns out that British scientists have recently discovered that neon light can make plants grow very quickly. Therefore, small neon lights have been installed in gardens at various farms and plant research institutes. This type of neon light is called "Irradiators."</p>
<p>This idea originally came from the Netherlands. The Dutch had discovered that bayberries could ripen in February under glass.</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Art Offstage</h3>
<p>— Zhang Songran</p>
<p>The art on stage, such as seat monopolization, hawkers shouting like vendors, and lighting coordination, safety equipment, etc., has gradually improved in many more upscale entertainment venues with the times. Now, only the entire audience has not yet understood the true meaning of entertainment, broadly speaking, it is the general order of society, and narrowly speaking, it is the "art offstage" that I want to talk about.</p>
<p>Shanghainese who go to the cinema to have fun are relatively the most punctual, because if they are late, the "sold out" sign will be hung high outside the theater door, and missing the mark will result in a refund. Even if you are lucky enough to buy a ticket, and the trailer has already started, it is not easy to choose a seat that is both well-angled and comfortable in the darkness.</p>
<p>The theater is not comparable to the low-level civilization drama. Ninety-nine percent of the audience are intellectuals, but there are more who are not punctual. Often, when the second or third act has just begun, there are still people coming in one after another. The wonderfulness of a drama lies in its acts, and the value of a scene lies in its scenes. Watching fewer acts will make it impossible to understand the characters' personalities and positions, and there is no way to understand the continuity of the plot. Spending money may not matter, but aren't you far away from your desired purpose? Drama actors express themselves with straightforward dialogue, unlike Peking opera, which has six-character tunes and B-character tunes, so the theater needs "silence" even more. But there are also some people coughing and spitting at this time, one after another, making a noisy mess.</p>
<p>The national opera theater is the worst, with three floors no less. Speaking of the main hall, it is said that those who watch the opening act are amateurs. Professionals arrive on time only when the famous actors come on stage, which is also the advantage of assigned seating. Therefore, for the automobile class, it is as unimpeded as in the case table era. Those who arrive late stand in front of you, waiting for the attendant to lead them to their seats, while enjoying the view first. As for whether they are blocking other people's view, that is not in their minds. After being seated, they call for tea and cigarettes, and also eat melon seeds and peel melon rind. If the stage is performing a wonderful part, or a good tune, wouldn't it be missed in vain! Sometimes the play is not over yet, but it is only a few minutes away from the end. Some people are already drawing lots. For example, if Ma Su has been executed, then there is no need to listen to Kong Ming's crying.</p>
<p>In short, not hindering the freedom of the public is true freedom.</p>

<h3>Performing French Famous Play Gold and Silver World</h3>
<p>— Zihong</p>
<p>This year can be said to be the peak year of popular drama and improved local drama.</p>
<p>Green Treasure, the vanguard of popular drama, is still alive and well. In three years, it has continuously performed 250 different dramas, which is truly a great achievement in the drama world.</p>
<p>Green Treasure's audience is a follower of Molière of France, and most of them like to watch light and humorous satirical dramas. With the help of Zhang Xunzi and Zhao Yanshi, bold and drastic adaptations of famous plays have been made into complete colors, such as The Ideal Wife changed to Worried by Self-Disturbance, Drunken Dream, and Death changed to Wine, Sex, and Wealth, and Making Money in a Proper Way changed to Miser, which have all been universally and enthusiastically welcomed. Foreign scripts are not suitable for Chinese people's tastes, and after bold adaptations, the solid superstitious brand is broken without being attacked.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhao Yanshi spent two months of effort to complete the adaptation of a famous work in the French drama world, which is the opening play of the Drama Arts Society, "In the Beginning of Man," and "Gold and Silver World," starring Gu Lan Jun Bai Hong. Although this play was very famous in the past, according to the French consulate's evaluation, "It is a pity that the very good comedy was performed too seriously!" Green Treasure is determined to grasp the theme and overcome this point according to this evaluation, and the play is named "Gold and Silver World" for a large-scale performance.</p>
<h3>Drama Notes</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>The final decision for the new golden actors is Ma Lianliang, Li Yuru, Ye Sheng Lan, Ma Fulu, etc., who are allowed to go south to perform after Ji Yuliang's term expires.</p>
<p>Xiaosheng Yu Zhenfei has returned to Suzhou to marry his niece and has arrived in Shanghai. He is still working with Golden and will perform on stage at the same time as Ma Lianliang and others.</p>
<p>The new actors Chen Hongsheng and Chen Guilan of Tianchan Theater debuted last night with good results. Many ticket buyers went to support the show. The theater has abolished the table system, changed to assigned seating, and hired female staff, which can be said to be completely new and has changed the old look.</p>
<p>The updated scriptwriting committee held a meeting yesterday and decided to add the festival play Cowherd and Weaver Girl from the 29th.</p>
<p>The second edition of my new play at the Gongtai Theater will be performed after "Cowherd and Weaver Girl."</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have read a message in your journal the other day, "The Shanghai Opera School was originally prepared to sing a twelve-day daily show at the Tianchan Theater, but because of the golden actors, it has been abandoned. After Ji Yuliang's term expires, the school will take over the backstage night show." After checking, there was no such negotiation as the school prepared to sing a twelve-day daily show at the Tianchan Theater, which is presumably a misrepresentation. The school sings daily shows at Golden every Wednesday and Saturday, which is a long-term schedule. Whenever the Beijing actors' term expires, the school will take over the night show for a short period of time, which is also a common occurrence, but all are agreed upon temporarily. I am deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, so I have sent a special letter to correct it. I hope you will investigate and publish this letter on the news, which is very much desired. Sincerely, Yellow Xianzhong, Vice President of Shanghai Drama School.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Where Does the Powerful Family Forcefully Take Her Away?</p>
<p>Yuan Yuan's adoptive mother sighed and said to Yuan Yuan, "I have been with you for a long time, and you are no different from my own daughter to me. The relationship between mother and daughter is very deep, so although there are many people outside who want to marry you back, I always feel reluctant to separate from you and am not willing to agree easily. Now I can't make the decision." As Yuan Yuan listened, her heart was beating faster and faster. She quickly said, "What is Mother saying? I don't understand. Why can't Mother make the decision?" The adoptive mother said, "Let me tell you the truth, it's that State Father Tian who came here because of your reputation. He drank two rounds of wine here. I don't know what kind of fate it is. Although he is old, his heart is not old. He loves your unparalleled beauty, so he wants to redeem you and take you to Beijing to serve him in his daily life. He is willing to pay any price, and he insists that I agree..." Before the adoptive mother finished speaking, Yuan Yuan was as if struck by lightning. Her whole body trembled involuntarily, and she let out a cry of "Ouch" from her cherry lips. She stared at her adoptive mother and leaned her hands on the table, standing up and asking, "Tian Hongyu, that old... old man, really has intentions for me? Then have you agreed to them? When did you tell them? Why didn't you tell me last night? How strange, how strange!" Yuan Yuan was still a little doubtful at this time, and her heart seemed to be going up and down. The adoptive mother sighed and said, "You can't blame me. Gao Gongzi and I talked about this matter downstairs yesterday afternoon. He said that he was ordered by State Father Tian to come here to act as a matchmaker, asking me how much money I wanted for your price, and he was prepared to redeem you. At that time, I said that I must discuss it with you before I can reply. He then said that this matter only requires me to make the decision, and I am not allowed to discuss it with you, nor am I allowed to tell you yesterday. He must have me agree. He also said that if I don't agree, I will anger the State Father, and he can immediately order the officials to seal my door and force me to hand you over, and I won't get a penny. He used such a great force to oppress me, so I had no choice but to agree. Eight thousand taels of silver is what they promised me, and I didn't dare to ask for too much. You must know how reluctant I am to be separated from you one day!" (147)</p>
