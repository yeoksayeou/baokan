<p>社評</p>
<h3>檢討日本</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福所提出租軍具案，正在美國會討論中，由於近數日孤立份子態度的再度頑梗，預料此案在國會中並非毫無阻礙，所謂加以修改或限制的見解也不是沒有實現的可能。但是無論反對者流如何堅持已見，加緊援助中英的建議實屬美國上下普遍的要求；對於遠東的堅强立塲尤為民主共和兩黨所一致主張，縱其前途運用還不免稍費周章，大體的趨勢却絕無可置疑，這一點世人儘可加以信賴的。</p>
<p>在美國這一態度之下，各民治國以至舉世反抗侵略的人士自感到莫大快慰，而在美當局所痛斥反對的侵略國家，尤其是所特別針對着的日本，對於此重壓究發生何等反應，自屬極可注意的問題。近衛隔昨對財界代表演說中對美國的抨擊。東條陸相召集圓桌會議關於所謂「國家緊急現狀」的討論，都可略見日方動態的一斑。這自然並不足以代表日本全國的見解，惟日政府既全在極端份子刦持之下，自亦絕無退嬰悔禍的可能；現在即使將太平洋風暴的是否終於爆發，仍列為疑問，但綜觀波濤激盪的趨勢，則無疑的逐步向那境界愈迫愈近。</p>
<p>檢討日本現狀，誰也難於理解其所以要對外從事冒險的理由何在。當一九〇〇年前後的對外行動，還可藉口於打破日本資本主義發展的桎梏；而在四十年後的今日，其經濟產業都在空前衰落萎縮之中，僅僅「天然願望」四字絕不足以日本人民深切體會這種絕無止境擴展的必要。大角，岑生說：「圖謀南進，自無說明理由的必要，』也許就是因為確屬無從說明吧！自美國另緊經濟制裁以來，日朝野高唱開發本國資源，實現三島的自足自給；既然其本國還不無尚待開發的餘地，又可見前此所謂「無」（Have-nots）的理論與重新分配資源的要求全屬欺人之談．更就其四十年來的演進歷史來說：征韓論時代日本朝鮮看成勢在必得的生命綫，不惜發動兩度對外太戰，付出重大代價去爭奪；及至所欲獲逐之後；目標推進到中國的東北；及其霸佔了滿洲，控制了中國若干富庶之區以後，其貪慾更飛躍到南洋；誠使南洋唾手可得，則繼之而起的，必謀實現田中奏章所說的以『征服亞洲為征服世界之起點』．這種逐步擴大絕無　止的願望，如果是上古的蠻族求逞於蠻族之間，那還不足為怪，若乃一個二十世紀號稱「一等文明國家」，而「理」竟不足以制其「欲」，蔚為不可思議的在想與暴行，是誠屬咄咄怪事．假如今日日本眞像亞歷山大之所至披靡，成吉思汗之氣吞山河，則其慾念之繼長增高，或不為過；今並侵華戰事且由日閥自承為不能取勝，在國際間除却左右支絀的德義而外亦復別無與國，以窮蹙凋敝之餘，而乃欲與全世界的民治强國為敵，並把美國當做主要對象，這原因也許只有精神病態學者纔能解答。在日政府的嚴格新聞統制之下，有時亦間可看到一些深抱疑懼的讜言危論；尾崎齊籐的往事不必說了，即如最近，馬洲談話而外，朝日新聞以至中外商業新聞之類也不時透露出悲觀論調；對於日本能吾能貫澈其預期目的表示懷疑，恐怖本年度經濟會趨於破產危險。然而自從政黨解散，議會僅類餼羊，這一類的卓見並不能從民間反映到政府，反而是國民新聞那種極端論調，儘管日當局謂其不能代表官方路綫，事實上却適與政府政策相合拍，有如對美備戰論即其一例。而最近右傾軍人政客態度之虛矯妄誕，尤竭盡內荏色厲的能事，並沒有一個力量能夠加以駕馭或控制，這一點實在是日本最大危臉所在。廻顧維新時代的歷史。主張擴展的軍閥如同山縣有明固然舉足重輕，而穩健持重的政治家如伊籘博文亦隱然與之形成均衡；因之卒能避免過分的操切和冒險，造成日帝國主義的黃金時代。三國的干涉還遼，樸資茅斯的和約，居然竟見能在戰勝之餘，力事隱忍，予以接受，實不能不歸功於陸奧宗光桂太郞之流的眼光識見，懂得惡滿忌盈的道理，不肯把新發於硎的日本國運輕易付之一擲。持此以與此際當權的日本軍人政客相較，相去固不可以道里計，同時也就不難從這裏瞭解其今昔興衰異勢的所以然。</p>
<p>國際間的角逐終須決之於彼此實力，虛聲凌厲的激烈論調，只能刺激對方，自長驕矜，騖虛聲，賈實禍，對於國家命運有百害而無一利，在歷史上實不乏顯例可尋。今日日本朝野初乏對美作戰的情緒與決意，但若干言論舉措又儼然在促進美日不幸前途的速臨，這是一個矛盾，也是日本內部失掉正常理智控制的結果。去年此際，曾有人提過不瞭解「東亞新秩序」的質問，最近又發現其國內一般人士對於「新機構」的含義亦復茫然，國策指導的中心如此，其他可知。今日日當局與其亟謀答覆美國的堅決政策，到不如先對國民多做些「新秩序」「新機構」的啓蒙工作，藉以測驗政府政策在民間的反應．這一存在於日本內部的弱點與暗影，其實際影響所至，絕不是美國日趨削弱的孤立主義所能幫它消弭的。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談　（三）　（十）</p>
<h3>希臘的政治軍事</h3>
<p>希臘地處巴爾幹半島南部，面積不過五萬方哩，人口不過七百十萬。論其實力，常備兵祇有十四萬人，預備兵六十萬人。各種野戰砲，連過山砲在內，不過四百三—五鬥，飛機祇有一百架左右，多數還是舊式。像這樣蕞爾小國，實力薄弱，竟把號稱世界一等强國人口四千三百萬的義大利擊敗，眞足以保持他們過去歷史上的光榮。</p>
<p>希臘在歐洲古代歷史中曾佔極光明的一頁，文化旣盛極一時，武功亦頗卓著。耶穌紀元前四百零九年，波斯帝國以大兵侵犯雅典，希臘將軍米勒狄率兵抵抗，大破波軍於馬拉松，道是歷史上有名的一次戰役，今日希臘軍隊在阿爾巴尼亞所獲的勝利，大可與之後先輝映。</p>
<p>希臘土地磽瘠，糧食缺乏，間或靠著海上貿易，顯得繁榮，而大部份的船隻，實際多租與英國，所以從經濟上講，本不足以引起野心家的覬覦。可是她所處地位，形勢衝要，為軍事上所必爭，因此常不免遭受外來的侵略。希臘的薩隆尼加，是中歐洲的後門，是通到達達尼爾海峽和黑海的跳板。由愛琴海至土耳其沿岸，希臘島嶼，星羅棋布。貝巴羅尼西半島接近義大利，克萊特島適居希臘到菲洲的中途。德義東進的三條路綫，希臘掌管着其中兩條的鎖錀。</p>
<p>義大利進攻希臘計劃的全部樞紐，原擬穿過希臘北部的平度期區域，沿奧斯河流域而下，以冀佔領曼德沙伏鎭，這是義大利軍隊第一個目標。然後分兵兩路，一路東趨卡拉巴卡，以窺西撒萊平原，一路西趨阿泰，與沿希臘海岸進攻的一軍會合。</p>
<p>假使這個計畫能順利進行，希臘南北兩部的聯絡，即被截斷，希臘前綫軍隊將與根據地隔絕，目有全部被包圍在愛比勒斯之慮。</p>
<p>不料希臘軍隊先發制人，在戰事初起後數日內，便把阿爾巴尼亞，南斯拉夫，希臘三國交界處普萊斯巴湖及文屈羅斯湖附近的高地乘機佔領，使出人柯立柴僅有的兩條公路，全在他們砲火控制之下，這路義大利軍隊的攻勢，便因此停頓。</p>
<p>在共他兩方面，祇因義大利軍司令部存了輕敵之心，把希軍抵抗力估計太低，以致原來的作戰計劃，都被粉碎。</p>
<p>在平度斯區域，義大利軍沿奧斯河流域而進，已到達曼德沙伏的中途，前鋒直抵斯馬立加高地，在愛比勒斯境內，也巳開到卡拉馬斯河。可是希軍此時，已經厚集兵力，奮勇抵抗，使義大利軍不能再越雷池一步，徒然消耗無數子彈，終至飢疲交迫，束手坐困。希軍以逸待勞，等到敵軍實力消耗，士氣衰竭，便乘勢反攻，銳不可當。在愛比勒斯的卡拉馬斯河一帶，希軍陣地鞏固，憑堅扼守，也把敵軍渡河的企圖，始終未能成功。</p>
<p>希臘現任首相兼陸軍部長梅達克薩斯，在第一次世界大戰時原是個親德份子，不料此决竟　成一個强硬的反軸心派。當六個月以前，一般人都以為梅達克薩斯或將不惜賣身投靠，傾向墨索里尼。可是英國已在挪威比利時受到第一次世界大戰時的教訓，便經由希臘王喬治、　世，壓迫梅氏。</p>
<p>喬治二世的父王康士坦丁，在第）次世界大戰中，因有親德嫌疑而失去王位。喬治二世，雖也曾一度遜位，但終以親英關係，而於一九三五年重登寳座，這一次當然不能不感恩圖報，特英國稍効微勞了。</p>
<p>前王康士坦丁，因不肯參加協　國作戰，而在一九一七年被迫去位，帶同長子喬治出奔。他的次子亞力山大被立為王，實權都操於親英首相威尼齊洛之手，希臘便在這時加入協約國參戰。一九二〇年十月，亞力山大因脚踝被猴咬傷，卒致不起，希臘舉行公民投票，要求康士坦丁回國，復辟。康士坦丁歸國兩載，終以英法拒絕承認，而不安於位，由太子喬治繼承。這位新君，臨朝祇有十五個月，又因威尼齊洛和他意見不洽，難於合作，以致被迫出國，王位虛懸。至一九二四年三月二十五日，為希臘獨立一百零三週年紀念，國會即於此時宣布由君主政體改為共和。</p>
<p>從一九二三年到一九二五年，在此短短十一一個月中，希臘政制改變，不下二十五次之多，外加兩次短命的獨裁制，一次由潘加洛斯將軍主動，歷時十四個月，即行崩潰，一次由柏萊斯蒂拉將軍領導，祇有十四小時，便巳壽終正寢。到了一九三五年十月，希臘陸軍發動政變，推戴康狄里斯將軍為首相兼攝政，取消共和中，恢復君主，經過相當波折以後，便迎請喬治二世歸國。他們父子兩人，一個曾二次遜位，一個又兩度登基，洵足後先媲美了。</p>
<p>喬治二世原是個風流天子，他流亡在外的十二年中，大半係僑居倫敦。他常喜於晚間出外閒遊，躑躅街頭，有一次踽踽獨行，竟蒙神女垂靑，這也可說是現代帝王的風流佳話。喬治又喜和貴族婦女交游，曲意周旋，致引起王后的妒忌，而於歸國復位之　，宣告離異。</p>
<p>他現巳年屆知命，膝下無兒，也不想再續鸞膠。曾有一時，盛傳他已和克萊文伯爵長女訂了嚙臂之盟。女家一方面從事闢謠，一方面却又說她和喬治一世已有十五年密切的友誼，個中真相，殊非局外人所得而知。當英皇愛德華八世巡弋亞德里亞海的時候，喬治會設宴款待。他們兩人本是表弟兄，喬治單請愛德華赴宴，愛德華携着他情人辛博森夫人偕往，後來愛德華覆請喬治，喬治也携着他的膩友出席。這幾位表弟兄，一個是不愛江山愛美人，一個是旣愛美人又愛江山，眞有異曲問工之妙。</p>
<p>喬治對於家庭生活和學識硏究都不感輿趣。他歡）喜騎馬，又歡喜開汽車在街路上疾馳。他也歡喜打獵，跳舞，愛聽第一夜開演的戲，愛穿着上好衣服。</p>
<p>自從他的父親在一九一七年被迫遜位，倉猝出奔，在十八年之中，他除一度做過短期的愧儡成立（一九二二至一九二三年）以外，常感流離失所。他嘗自稱為「一個失業者？希望恢復他原有的職業」。</p>
<p>可是到了一九三五年，他突然覺到自已成為國間際的重要人物了。希臘陸軍部長康狄里斯是個親義大利派人物，喬治二　則主張親英。當時的首相蔡達里斯本屬共和黨，後來翻然一變而為勤王黨。終於壓逼着康狄里斯操縱公民投票，而以百分之九十八的絕大多數，迎請喬治二世復位。他於一九三五年十一月二十五日自倫敦重返希臘國土，復理萬幾。</p>
<p>喬治雖得復位，希臘政治依然紊亂如故，康狄里斯志在專政，喬治又不甘以傀儡國王自居，旋將康氏罷黜，宣布自由選舉。不科事情愈弄愈糟，新國會中，威尼齊洛派和反威尼齊洛派勢均力敵，舉足輕重之權，反操於十五席共產黨人之手。威尼齊洛和蔡達里斯兩人，又相繼死亡，無人輔助憲政。喬治不得已，請陸軍部長梅達克薩斯擔任組閣，梅派在國會中雖僅佔七席。却一口應允，並不推辭。但恐投票表決時不利於已，突請下令解散國會，翌日即改組內閣，廢除政黨，實施嚴密檢查，至一九三八便自任終身總理，喬治雖欲乾綱獨斷，依然不能掌握實權</p>
<p>梅達克薩斯在國內亦深不孚人望，他所支持的政體，旣不是君主立憲，亦不是專制而帶些法四斯化，以國王命令，秘密警察，和靑年運動治全國「人民沒有自山。以首相　長外交，敎育，及陸海空軍諸部。他和喬治二世之間，還有一個小小秘密存在。喬治雖為一國兀首，手頭常感拮据，因此他曾簽發一道命令，支取他流亡在外這幾年的俸給，這個把柄，落在梅氏手中，喬治知道他若一旦和自己翻臉，便會把這秘密宣布，引起人民反對。因此事事容忍，梅達克薩斯所以欲挾持希王　獨軍攬政大權，大槪全在這點吧</p>

<h3>美日關系惡化的現階段（下）</h3>
<p>米內內閣成立，有田出任外相，他久巳擁護一柏林羅馬軸心」政策，無意與格魯大使賡續談判。在去年夏天米內內閣傾覆之前，有田雖曾和格魯談判幾决，但在近衛再度組閣投入軸心懷抱之後，此種談判的希望父歸泡影。迄至最近三個月來，松岡和格魯雖曾舉行幾决很坦白的談話，但僅就兩國齟齬日深一點，加以認識罷了。</p>
<p>在日本嚴厲的新聞檢查制度之下，凡是英義法德義蘇各國大使與外務省官員問的各種接觸，或是荷蘭公使和日木官員間的一切談話，當地報紙都不准登載隻字，即向外國拍發電報亦在禁例。即美商日本廣知報（按現已由日人收買，與日本泰晤士報合併）因在社交新聞欄裏登載了一張美國大使格魯請客名單，列入美國駐蘇聯大使史丹哈特與松岡外相，結果竟遭當局禁止發行。在松岡本人對於公佈他的姓名，原無　對之意，但情報部堅持該報已觸犯禁例，須加懲處。日本境內所有美國僑民對於時局本來極感不安，美國國務院勸吿撤退後，即紛紛淸理業務，趕快回國，但態度從容，並無慌張之象。美國駐東京總領事統計，美國公民留居日本的共有六千餘人，其中四千多人是入美國籍的日本人，他們大部份不致離日。截至目前為止，已有一千美僑撤退回國。他們因為感覺日常生活困難，日用品如煤，汽油，奶油，麵包，金屬品及進口貨的缺乏，奢侈品的遭受禁止，早就準備回國了。</p>
<p>日本警察特別是憲兵的四出干涉，性質允其嚴重，這種恐佈行動無疑的是針對外國人而發，日本人和美國人的接觸，因之成為禁律。日本人都不敢和德義兩國以外的外國人交際，否則便引起嫌疑，遭受盤詰。日木當局警吿人民勿和外國人接觸，或替外國人工作，現巳發生效力。</p>
<p>近來凡有人前往英美兩國大使館的，多遭逮捕鞠訊，拘留數日之久，英美使館曾為此事向日方提出抗議。</p>
<p>要之，日本國內恐怖情形，片言難盡，各國僑民，除軸心國僑民和外交官員不致被捕外，誰都惴惴不安，有隨時被捕入獄的戒心。</p>
<p>英美兩國僑民對於日本與英美萬一在今年春間開戰，他們如何離開一層，正在紛紛討論。外交官屆時雖可乘「大使船」安全離日，但其他僑民能否在最后一分鐘附乘「外交船」返國，還是沒有把握。美國僑民多在考慮，一旦戰事發生，他們是吾將被圈禁，或留作人質，以便與美國境內的日僑相交換，事實上美國境內日僑人數與日本境內美僑人數成為二百與一之比。至於英日一旦開戰後，英僑因無美元或加拿大元存款，不能前往美洲，大多數將退往金鎊集團的澳洲避去難。</p>
<p>英華僑民所感的不安，並非純由政治情勢使然，實因日本是一個島國，太平洋如果發生戰事，即有無法躱避砲火之苦，所以他們多遵守木國政府的勸吿，從容不迫地實行撤　了。（完）</p>

<p>談判完成　常態恢復</p>
<p>談判結果、校方接受下列三條件、（一）下學期起增加薪給二成至四成、（二）決不藉故更調敎員、（三）各敎員均可寄宿校中、談判至此各敎員巳大體認為滿意、惟尙有六個月計薪一項、校方因經濟力不堪負担、允以五個半月計薪、尙未能完全決定、但雙方均巳允由關係方面負責解決、故校務立即恢復常態、校長與敎職員亦復和好如初、一塲風波、由此結果、關係方面及社會人士對於雙方尙能顧及大體、深明大義、極表歡慰、至六個月計薪一節、關係方面一俟決定辦法、即當分飭遵照、任何方面、不得另持異議云、</p>

<p>華商早市塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期跌〇六二五、遠期平定、紐的銀價仍平、倫教生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬等均平、美對英不動、對滬小三分、對法俱無市中央掛牌各如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四六八七五、美滙五元半、與上日晚收價相埒、開後華商投機及華商銀行咸有求售之心、先後售予匯豐及美行木月份美滙都為五元五三一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、平衡稅低百分之〇、二五、此後美行如大通等亦賣、市面仍帶硬化、計有利入一月份美匯五元五三一二五、但十時半後、扒風忽起投機家扒結甚夥、以賣戶斯時已極减少、供求相差中、遂見趨緊、計投機家結下月份美匯軟達五元四六八七五、延至收盤、為狀愈俏、計現貨及本月份先令告三辦士四六八七五、美匯五元半、下月份先令三辦士四五三一二五、美滙五元四六八七五、午後週三無市、比上日英美兩滙、榮辱不分、</p>

<h3>掉期方過買風突來　金價跌後大漲　午後塲外抬至六六五〇元　現金照明交須低一百念元</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、先跌後突劇漲、已破入六千五白元內、後竟飛出至六千六百元關、各方人心由疲轉堅、乃巨多大豐、天元來加碼猛進、外滙山鬆轉軟、故證券幫德孚亦來傾售、小至六千四百六十五元、後來復進、故飛上至六千六百十五元高價、中途雖有滙票商套賣、仍難稍挽已熾之漲勢、終反跌軋升八十四元、為六千六百元、照二月期美滙午收結價、為六千三百八十九元、計抬二百十一元、上半日交易近萬兩、下午週三無市、塲外價已飛至六千六百五十元、掉期一月份轉入二月期、買方貼出予賣方由一百四十元、回升達一百六十元、現金聞益大。熾大照期交低一百廿元有買意、無做開、飾金升十元、達六百六十元、關金等仍平</p>
<p>烚赤好八十四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市即低六元、為六千五白十元、次見六千四百六十五元、證券幫德孚與銀號滙票商來傾出、散多傾斬、價遂步降五十元、入六千五百元內、降至六千四百六十五元、天元大豐加碼來進、頓起回風、金及大號德成證券號同康來買、且外滙止鬆回平、價逐飛上七十七元、回出六千五百元外、達六千五百四十二元、時見天元復出、鑫源亦售出、退至六千五百卅元、大豐再來傾進、德孚亦來復購、祥和補空、散戶紛起猛抬、漲勢突銳、價再飛上八十五元、午刻飛出六千六百元外、升至六千六百十五元、終因新豐套出、收市六千六百元、比前日晚收價升八十四元、收後六千五百九十五元、旋即升至六千六百〇五元、半日有一百五十元上落、下午無市、聞價再飛上至六千六百五十元、現金號之本牌金、售價比期交易低一百十元、收進比售出低四十元、現標金無出入、乏價、</p>
<p>首飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行初掛六百五十元、正午升十元、達六百六十元、收進减卅元云、</p>
<h3>外幣亦升不少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、跌後突漲、英美金鎊、終升二元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票始曾退至十七元九角七分、午後突然抬至十八元三角三分、卒為十八元二角半、比上日軋升二角二分、香港票需要不少、市價挺漲、日金票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市價為一元五角八分、朝鮮票需要仍殷、晚市續高至一元二角二分、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機愈形熱烈　紗價昂騰　雙馬最高四一〇元　廠方續開五千七百包</h3>
<p>紗市續堅、且漲風允熾、此因投機者異常活躍之故也、市塲情形、全依標金作根據、至於實際交易、本屬平庸、無奈雙馬步步上升、心思亦被其激昂、稍稍採辦矣、不過廠方乘機開出日見湧旺、二十支雙馬高峯為一千四百二十五元、低價為一千三百九十一元、午後始做一千四百三十元、後做一千四百二十七八元、永安　開出二十支特金城三千五百包、價為一千三百三十五至四十元、二三月期每包定洋二百元、崇信廠開出二三支大發千包、價為一千三百四十元、三月份、申新二廠開出十支童子軍二百包、價為九百五十元、三月期云、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上午後市人氣始昂繼軟、市氣尙平、買戶零星不旺、首盤價為一千四百〇四元、此價一開、生大及金子幫吐出、市盤見鬆、後以金子掉期貼價殊鉅、而市價仍平疲、反趨下降、跌至一千三百九十一元、在九十六七元迥旋時期甚久、但金價稍好、紗市隨之上升、時近十一時半以後、謠風大熾、投機商大為活動、市盤直上至一千四百二十三元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千五百四十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　六、二〇〇　香港三四〇</p>
<p>寗波　四〇　統計六、五八〇</p>
<h3>棉不及紗之俏</h3>
<p>現棉情况、隨紗市而昂、但銷路僅華廠一部份有需要、外廠絕無辦意、此因直向海外購訂之故也、所以棉市不及紗市之向榮、不過棉紗含投機性質交易爲多、能上能下也、</p>
<p>另訊紐的棉市、先因外商售出而跌、旋因一部份同業購進稍漲、卒以紐奧倫期售出再跌、結果較上日收盤價格又小七八磅音、印棉市况、日來因日廠之購買、交易殊形活躍、昨日連同預測、漲二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、良以紗價步趨漲勢、華棉來源稀少、棉市頓呈堅定狀態、廠方旣乘高價開出棉紗、同時抵補原棉亦殷、故近日各同業間之販買、甚為活躍、總計成交之數、竟近千包左右、棉市樂觀、拭目可待也、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債穏定　匯豐銀行派息　怡和紗廠股漲</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况大戶雖不少進出、而市價竟極為穩定、成交雖尙稱熱鬧、而競爭仍為多方佔優勢、檯面多方雖有出籠、而大戶亦有補空及做多、如同康雖有出籠、而順昌號忽有大數買進、信孚於上午賣出、而午後忽又有補進、十六號亦有買回、餘如德孚易中買進亦不少、同順牲昶永康亦有吸收、鼎康久豐賣出較多、協康五和聯和均有結出、市價仍甚堅挺、結果除丁種因交易極少、市價無上落外、餘均略好一角至一角半、成交約二百二三十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交浙江興業銀行股三十股、價為一百十四元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市趨勢穩定、交易甚為繁忙、怡和紗廠股最受歡迎價格一度漲至四十八元半、中營曁業廣二地產公司股價亦有相當進展、後者曾見十五元八角高價、但因獲利了結者衆多、收盤步回至十五元一角、橡皮股岑寂、</p>
<p>英商匯豐銀行昨接總行電告、一九四〇年末次股息、每股仍派二鎊十先令、未扣所得稅、父攤提營業房地產港幣一百萬元、叉滾入下屆港稱三百四十二萬二千元、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米源源接濟民食　連日均有數萬包到埠　昨市米價頗見參差狀</h3>
<p>洋米不斷而來、昨日又有一萬九千餘包到滬、計太古公司湖南輪昨午抵埠、由香港裝來五千五百八十八包、又怡和洋行定生輪亦由香港運來一萬三千八百六十一包、昨晨到滬、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、該輪另有二百十三包、定日內原船運往烟臺、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨晨開市後、即承前日之漲風、市氣頗見挺秀、且市上謠言蠭起、執貨者趁機扳俏、早市一度喊高近元、旋以越南之國防費越幣二兀半尙有求免之可能、人心又為向下、惟匯水回縮定價劃高、洋行打出電報三千噸尙未復實、故在存充到湧定多之際、市價依然挺站、結果現期兩米各漲半元左右、回籠原包開出七百噸、計小紋十二月九日八十八元、一月十六日八十一元四角、一月份八十二元、二月份八十一元六角、現未成交七千多包、洋</p>
<p>早市開手、買方零星店胃亦頗添購、當時形勢仍覺栗落、若一般較為落低之二號西貢及小絞等貨、價曾提六七角、最高時、二號西貢開八十元、小絞開七十二元二三角、不過經此一提之後、洋行家突將大批期路貨拋出、且懷有多數現貨者、將繼乘高脫售、一時人心頓虛、本街銷塲轉懈、於是上風市面、即復回軟、行情節節落低、直迄近午方稍站住、結果收盤價除小絞及二號西貢等以去路較熱、價則較足、又見增高三五角、小絞為七十二元、次七十一元、二號西貢七十九元八角、中至七十七元外、他如一號西貢火紋等高貨以價貴銷滯、反比前市短元砠、總觀昨日米市大勢、似乎各視去路之凉熱、及價格之廉貴而變化、所以頗多參差、堪稱為升降不一之局也、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、昨日到貨獨稀、而店胃頗爽、所以形成供求不勻、售價回升元砠、開常幫眞特斛見白粳一百零四五元、原包一百零八元、崑山白粳一百零二元至九十七元、原包一百零六元、靑角薄稻斛見九十七元、九十六元半、原包一百零二元、一百零一元半、</p>
<h3>辦胃稍貪　洋粉緊一角</h3>
<p>麵粉日昨粉市、尙稱平穩、查本客銷塲、因米價疲後稍振、進胃較貪、執貨者亦以目下新到暫時缺乏、滬存洋粉、亦不過多、更值年關將屆、一般有力貨主、均思待守善價、故市塲求脫者漸尠、局勢已入醞釀之態、熱烈牌子鐘樓花鳥牌澳粉、價開二十三元六角、香港新到之藍麥花脾價開二十三元四角、均比上日各緊一二角、成交綜計五千餘包、悉由本客零星辦去、華廠平賣粉供出四千包稍零、價均為二十一元五角、結束期近、各業均呈歲暮景象、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨小麥交易、仍鮮做開、華廠因新到洋麥一船、額計四千餘噸、業已起卸、並不亟亟收買、日廠方面、僅門市略有零星收　、為數甚微、售價仍守原盤、市塲賣買、概無聽聞、</p>
<h3>疋頭　漂染費將加價　坯布交易突旺　本街趕早發染</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市堅穩如故、浮多獲利頗有轉賣、然因廠方開價步昂、業內外囤戶納胃續健、售盤堅挺、組細布斜紋大市平平、一部份漲每疋一角至二角半、漂染布及坯布亦續升每疋二角半至五角、聞漂染整理費、過農歷年關後、將一致增加、故本街批發號均趕早發染、坯布交易生色不少、木街成交各布八百餘件、浙閩幫略辦藍布漂布粗細布等二百餘件、粵港幫辦色斜漂布等一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　繼漲增高、市盤續昂、龍頭細布後市高峯到四十四元六角半、收盤為四十四元五角、四君子嗶嘰一元二角五分三七五、</p>
<h3>糖市　日商囤糖</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙見緊、而日商復進B嘜車白及荷赤共達三四千包、故趨勢續緊、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧八十元半至八十元、外棧七十九元六元角至八十元、升八角、二月十日打單八十元三角至六角、升二角、荷棉白BS嘜七十八元半、荷赤六十五元二角至四角、不動、</p>

<h3>自然界的囤積商（下）</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>性吝</p>
<p>又一種喜歡囤積的昆虫，也是我們最常看見的，就是螞蟻。這傢伙的囤積手段，幾乎是純粹出於侵略和搶掠之一途的。允其是非洲著名的白蟻，有多少旅客作過牠們的兇惡可怕的叙述啊！可是越是囤積家越是慳吝：螞蟻的性吝，證之於法國文學家拉風歹納（LaFontoine)所著寓言詩的開宗明義的第一篇就可明瞭。這詩的大意是說：秋蟬向鄰居的螞蟻借糧，可是「蟻性非慷慨，是乃其小疵。向客前致問：「盛夏君何處？——朝暮向客唱，想君不見訾。」螞蟻凛然語：「君唱余悅怡！而今更請君，婆娑舞多姿！」——假設有人敢向囤積商人通融一點什麼柬西，我想他那「免開尊口」的盾牌，和她訑拒人於千里之外的神情，較之道螞蟻，恐怕要厲害千倍了。</p>
<p>視短</p>
<p>在我國北方田野裹，有一種囤積食糧的動物，俗名叫作「瞎墳猪。」牠有一尺多長，形狀很像猪。至於所以叫為「墳猪，」是因為牠掘作地道，把土運到外面堆積成墳的緣故。所以稱為「瞎」的，是因為牠只知道埋頭囤積，「眼雖設而常關，」於是久而久之，把兩眼退化到完全瞎了。牠當着秋天禾稼成熟的時候，通夜的搬運囤積：據說有人掘牠的巢穴，竟有獲得食糧至二三斗的！——把這副圖畫給眼光如豆，不能高瞻遠矚的囤積商人作寫真吧！</p>
<p>憑高</p>
<p>在動物中，憑高而作囤積事是物也：身體輕盈，手腕圓活，高據樹巔以左瞻右矚，故能消息靈通，遇險先逸！兼之狡兎三窟，遷徙靡常，故失事之時極鮮。——囤積商人的作崇枝倆，乃是他們的不傳之秘，恕我這門外漢不多贅吧。</p>
<p>多刺</p>
<p>在中南美洲各又有無數的大囤積家滋生著：那便是巍峨成林的仙人掌（Cactus），團圓成球的仙人頭(Mami)llaria），和一枝挿天高到六丈的仙人棒（Cierne）。這許多東西，為保護它們自己的囤積品免得叫旁的動物分肥起見，沒有不是渾身長着堅固鋒利儼如刀劍的硬刺的。假設有胆敢前來作染指之想的不識相者：「當心！看傢伙！」那個不感覺棘手，知難而退呀？——囤積商人身上的芒刺，一定更多，不然的話，怎麽國法，與論，和懷着滿腔憤怒的人，竟沒有一個敢搖動其分毫的呢？</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>世界上的生物，一定要合作互助，纔能達到共同滋長，共同繁榮的目的。一味的囤積居奇，置大衆的性命於不顧，旁人盡死，自己又豈能獨生呢？按原始狀態的蜜蜂說：蜜造成後，有野熊野猪的光顧，食其蜜而毀其巢。按螞蟻說：有食蟻獸的追蹤尋跡，犁庭掃穴。按瞎墳猪說：有狐狸的喧賓奪主，鵲巢鳩佔！那一個能安然享受牠囤積的物品而毫無隱憂呢——囤積家啊！由於蜜蜂的前車，你應該記着！「釀得百花成蜜後，為誰辛苦為誰甜？」因着螞蟻的敎訓，盼望你槐夢速醒，從瞎墳猪的結果，盼望你不要自掘墳墓！</p>
<h3>女人難做</h3>
<p>— 南人</p>
<p>因為自己是一個女人，叉因為自己老是毛手毛脚的行動不當心，因此，碰釘子的事，在我竟是每年都要遭到一兩决。雖然社會巳經進化到够文明，可是在道世間，女人總還似乎不是個吉祥的東西。</p>
<p>記得還在孩提的時候，一决，因為沒留心，動了動隔壁公公的黃烟筒，吃那老傢伙的兩記巴掌，還挨上母親一頓痛駡：</p>
<p>「小鬼頭，做什麼弄壞了公公的烟筒？那東西有二十年沒觸過女人的手，裹面的烟龍只差缺一個頭啦！」</p>
<p>但孩子的心，是不會懂得那么多事的，我只是咕著嘴不服氣，因為我並沒打折那煙筒。</p>
<p>又有一决，那是在舅舅家做客的時候，巳經十六七歲啦，為了不高興讓自己的襯杉袴，給女傭人洗得墨黑黑，自個兒洗了，不留心晒上了專晒舅舅衣服的竿子。</p>
<p>究竟是人大啦，而且又做客，我居然沒有吃耳刮子，也不曾挨上駡，只看了舅母一張灰色的臉，女傭人給我傳過來一些人們背後的嘰咕：</p>
<p>「這麽大的女孩子，還不知道規矩，襯衫袴也可以拉着竹竿就晒的？將來也好到婆婆家吃飯！」</p>
<p>像這樣的事，眞是遭遇到太多，常常為了跨過一根小販的扁担，或是動了動木匠們的鑿子，墨斗，耳朶裹就裝滿了髒骯的話，一次次的白眼，是連記也記不起了。</p>
<p>但我對於這些事，總也只是難過一會就過去了，對着那些無智識的人，原也只能退後一二個世紀看，我能够怪他們一點什麽呢？</p>
<p>可是這一决，我終於有點茫然了，雖然仍是同樣的一個釘子，但我直到今天還覺得有點兒難堪。</p>
<p>事情是發生在一星期之前，一個晴朗的天氣，為了母親生病，我不能不搭船回鄕間去。</p>
<p>心是急的，一個人買點兒東西，跨上船，每一處都是黑壓壓的擠滿了人。</p>
<p>「坐頭等艙吧！那兒人總淸一點。」心裹想着，就急急的往那邊跑。</p>
<p>「猪玀！沒有生眼睛嗎？」肩膀被一隻手緊緊的抓住了，回過頭來，是一張斯文人的臉。</p>
<p>『你看，這是什麽東西？』</p>
<p>依着他手指的地方看去，我發覺一隻帽匣子正趟在我的脚旁邊，於是，本着過去碰釘子的經騐，我立刻明白那是怎麽回事了。</p>
<p>『新的帽兒，八塊半錢買來的，就觸了這霉兒！』</p>
<p>他像獅子樣的吼着，我覺得沒有辦法，溜開吧，肩膀被他緊抓着，就只好呆看他的臉了，那是一張斯文人的臉，蒼白的，戴着玳璈邊的眼鏡，那臉決不會是一個沒受過敎育的人底，我茫然了。</p>
<p>「識相點，給我八塊半錢，誰要這觸了霉的東西！」</p>
<p>雖是冬天，我可滿身都淌了汗了，袋裹僅剩有一張十元的法幣，他竟然要我賠這頂帽子。</p>
<p>「喂！你到底打算怎麼的？」那東西把我的肩膀只一鈕，我痛得幾乎叫了出來。</p>
<p>「把錢給他吧，拿着頂帽子也好的。」這樣想着，我立刻摸出了那張僅剩的法幣：</p>
<p>「拿去，找我一塊半錢，帽子拿來！」</p>
<p>從那東西手裹，接過來兩張破碎的票兒和一隻帽匣，我眞想哭了，那果然是不吉的東西嗎？</p>
<p>抬起頭來，幾十雙眼睛都望着我，一些人還在竊竊的私語。</p>
<p>揭開匣蓋，帽子還是那麽鮮明的！</p>
<p>兩張破碎的法幣，恰恰够買回家的三等票。</p>
<p>「女人的一切眞是都不吉的嗎？」想着這問題，有好幾個夜晚我都失眠了。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>他很得意地回頭去向跟定在後面的幾個人說，但就在道時候，突然驀地瞧見有一件黑越越的東西，向他道邊飛過來了。</p>
<p>「快把你的手放下去！雞道帶兵的人就好吃人嗎？」一條很高的嗓子，驀地在右邊在吼起來；，距離他不到一二十步路光景，正有一個同樣打扮的年輕人，鐵靑着臉，目眦欲裂的看着他。雖然只是一個科班學生，却自有一種不可輕視的胆氣。</p>
<p>現在所有的人全驚動了，宋師傅也立刻發覺自己方才不該忽略了這一個孩子。劉玉華是他姊姊遺下的一個孤兒，他的性格他是向來知道的，差不多世界上沒有可以使他害怕的人，又是和玉琴最親密的把兄弟；他眞懊悔方才沒有想到他，不先向他可嚀一番，此刻終於閙起來了，那還有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>袁師長從三年前高升以後，眞可說是任性慣了。只要他想做的事，天下就沒有什麼人可以阻擋，也沒有什麼人敢，除非這個人是不想吃飯了！什麽叫法律，什麽叫人情，在他看來，都是笑話；他覺得他自己就是法律，自己的意志，就可以決定一切。什麼督軍，什麼大總統，都不在他的心上！所以劉玉華的竟敢公然賣駡他，眞幾乎使他懷疑自己是在做一個惡夢，以致失了對付的能力，反而眞把他托着玉琴下額的手收回去了，同時還向玉華丟過來的那頂黑皮帽兒，很吃驚地看了一眼。</p>
<p>但那個陪他同來的玉振班的財東却早巳嚇壞了。</p>
<p>「老……宋，這……孩子……可……可……有瘋病……嗎？」</p>
<p>「誰有瘋病？你才是瘋子呢！」王華像一頭小大蟲似的忘了一切的顧忌，指着財東說：一讓這種東西來欺負學生，還不是瘋子嗎！」</p>

<h3>沈西苓追悼會昨日舉行　費穆認為影壇失一最優秀導演　友好決議集送賻金一千五百元</h3>
<p>沈西苓先生於去年十二月十七日在重慶因患腸出血症不治逝世，上海的朋友們，咋天爲他舉行了一個座談會式的追悼會，到者都是他的生前友好，和幾位留日同學。沒有什麼儀式，除向遺像行一鞠躬幷靜默三分鐘以誌哀思外，就由大家輪流說一點感想，周劍雲先生首先發言，認爲沈氏是藝人的楷模，後來者應該向他學習。繼之，費穆先生說：一我和西苓先生，私交並不很厚，現在，我作爲一個他的作品的觀衆來說一點感想，我覺得西苓的風格像孫瑜，但比孫瑜接近現實，也像楚生，但表現在作品上的，楚生尖刻，西苓却是溫厚，所以我認爲西苓的死，並不誇張，可以說中國電影界喪失了一位最優秀的導演。」費導演叉把席上的幾幀沈氏銀幕遺作的照片指給在座諸君看，他說：「許多電影照片是不能隔過幾年再拿出來看的，但我們看到這幾張照片，非但還有鑒賞的價值，而且現在還不容易看到，每一個微細的地方，都可以看出西苓曾費過番心血，這是一位多方面的優秀藝人！」接着還有許多人談話，歸納起來，對西苓從事藝術的刻苦，用功，誠摯，認爲不可多得，所以西苓的逝世，損失的不僅是他的友好，更是尙在萌芽中的中國藝壇－－特別是在烽火連天中，少不掉西苓這麼一個人！</p>
<p>最後決定集送賻金一千五百元，匯交沈氏的未亡人熊輝女士，除友好之外，也收景仰沈氏的外界諸君的賻贈，並定於半月內收齊。外界賻贈，可交申報（游藝界）中美（藝林）正言（草原）神州（神臯雜俎）大晚（剪影）大美（夜光）等六報副刊編輯部代收。</p>

<h3>US Government Authorizes Navy Department to Supply Armed Assistance to Philippine Islands; Orders All Warships to be Fully Equipped for Wartime; Increases Personnel as if Enlisting National Guard</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Executive Department took action yesterday, authorizing the Navy Department to sell naval weapons and supplies to the Philippines at any time, in order to provide prompt assistance for the defense of the Philippines. Congressman Vinson, a Democratic Representative from Georgia and Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, was the one who, accepting the Navy's request, suggested the bill to the House. He told a United Press reporter that the bill would be considered by the Naval Affairs Committee in the shortest possible time. Resident Commissioner Elizalde told a United Press reporter that Vinson's bill has the full support of the Philippines. He said that he would represent it in his personal capacity. According to the opinion of the Philippine Commission, the bill was drafted after consultation with Philippine officials, and is part of the US's program to arm the Philippines. The Philippine Commission also stated that the US Army has obtained the right to supply the Philippines with army weapons and supplies, but the Navy has not yet done so. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Walsh, a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts and Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, told a United Press reporter yesterday that the recent naval reorganization is a matter of naval strategy and does not require a resolution or consideration by the Senate. The administrative leaders have apparently all recognized the establishment of this new naval organization, hoping for an effective naval tactic, as a reasonable matter, and he has not seen any objections raised. The naval reorganization includes the appointment of Admiral Kimmel as Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, succeeding Admiral Richardson, ordering all warships to be fully equipped for wartime, and dividing the US Fleet into three major fleets: the Atlantic, Pacific, and Far East. Washington rumors recently are rife that Richardson may be appointed as Ambassador to the United Kingdom, succeeding Kennedy, who recently resigned. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>President Lambasts Isolationists; House Reviews Aid Bill</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt yesterday, during his regular meeting with reporters, vigorously attacked Senator Wheeler, an isolationist, who had said that the President's aid-to-Britain bill was "endangering the lives of one in four American youths." Therefore, the President called it "the most untruthful, cowardly, and unpatriotic statement ever made. In this era, we have not heard of such political depravity." Afterwards, Wheeler replied, "The President seems to be in a rage. I hope that my words will not come true in the future, and that American youths will not sacrifice their lives. The most unpatriotic thing is to incite national emotions and lead the country into war, causing American youths to be killed on foreign battlefields. I declare to the nation that every statement the President has made since his re-election has gradually led the country to fight for foreign countries." (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said yesterday that regarding the bill to aid democratic countries, the committee plans to summon Willkie, the defeated Republican presidential candidate, to testify. Also, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet today and will also summon former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy and Ambassador to France Bullitt to testify separately. Furthermore, in order to strengthen national defense, President Roosevelt has ordered six divisions of the National Guard and smaller units, a total of 100,800 men, to serve on active duty for one year. The implementation date has not yet been determined. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) House Speaker Rayburn said yesterday that he is willing to accept any restrictions on the Lend-Lease Act, as long as they do not hinder the main purpose of the bill. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom stated that he plans to propose one or two amendments to the bill. Today, when the Foreign Affairs Committee examines the bill, Secretary of State Hull will first express his opinions, and then listen to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement. On Thursday, Navy Secretary Knox and US National Defense Council Director Knudsen will both attend to express their views. He does not intend to summon former Ambassador to France Bullitt and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy to testify before the Foreign Affairs Committee, but if Willkie, Bullitt, or Kennedy request to speak to the Foreign Affairs Committee, he can find a way to listen to them. Representatives of the America First Committee have requested to make a statement to the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee has granted their request. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>US Assistance Greatly Increased; Britain Establishes Supply Committee in the US</p>
<p>(London) The large increase in North American supplies to Britain has made it necessary to reorganize the British-American liaison mechanism. Therefore, a committee has now been established, called the British Supply Council in North America, chaired by Purvis, who is currently a leader of a purchasing committee in the United States. Other members include Baleau, the Australian representative of the British Imperial Economic Committee, Self, the director of the British Aviation Committee, and Evans, the chief representative of the Admiralty in Canada. All matters relating to supply policy, such as contacting the US authorities, will be handled by this committee, and Baleau will assume the position of leader of the British Purchasing Committee in the United States. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Ottawa) A spokesman for the Canadian Department of Munitions and Supply told a Reuters interviewer last night that the organization of the new British Supply Council aims to implement a method of completely adjusting North American operational efforts. In the future, the extraordinary efforts of Britain, the United States, and Canada to manufacture war equipment will be the direct result of this organization. People here consider Purvis's appointment as chairman of the British Supply Council in North America to be satisfactory. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Washington officials believe that the US organization of the North American Supply Council is fully in line with the current development of economic and military supply methods between the United Kingdom and the United States. Although the scope of activities of the British Purchasing Committee in the United States is very broad, it is still insignificant compared to the amount of war equipment transported from the United States to the Atlantic in the next two years under the Lend-Lease Act. This new organization is necessary to facilitate the transport of US war equipment to the United Kingdom, and Purvis's leadership is considered to be the right person. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Miller, First Secretary of the British Embassy here, in an interview with the International News Service, Britain wants to build its destroyers in US shipyards. Miller said, "You built destroyers for us last year, and they will be useful now." Miller did not reveal whether his proposal had been formally submitted to the US government, nor did he state how many destroyers Britain would like to build in US shipyards. Miller said that the process of manufacturing British merchant ships in the US is urgently needed by Britain. "The most important thing now is to build merchant ships quickly." When reporters asked if Britain would use US shipyards to repair its damaged British warships if the President's full aid-to-Britain program passed as originally proposed, Miller was quite skeptical. Miller pointed out that the implementation of this matter would take a long time. He also expressed doubt about whether the US would be able to complete the preparation of repair equipment in the naval bases obtained from Britain in the near future. He predicted that the lease of naval bases would soon be finalized. As for the British criticism of the island bases, Miller expressed disappointment. Miller also said, "The British side did not force the US government to accept the equal status as bases. We should make every effort to satisfy the Americans." Recent news reports that the British side will levy import taxes on US raw materials shipped to the leased bases. Miller said that this issue has not yet been decided, but "we do not want to build any tariff barriers around these bases." (International News Service, 15th)</p>
<p>Japan Building Several Large Airfields in the Paracel Islands</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Several large Japanese airfields on the Paracel Islands have recently been completed. These airfields are large enough to accommodate 300 aircraft and have equipment for seaplanes. According to local newspapers, each airfield also has underground hangars and repair shops. After the completion of this new air force base, more than 50 Japanese aircraft have been transferred from the Japanese airfield on Hainan Island to the islands. The Japanese seaplanes in Yulin Port have also been moved to this new base. The Paracel Islands are more than 100 miles southeast of Hainan Island, closer to Japan's southward target. According to local sources, the Paracel Islands may have been used to refuel and inspect German raiders. Reliable sources said that the Japanese army on Hainan Island has increased from 20,000 to 30,000 after two detachments of the Japanese army from Guangzhou arrived. These newly arrived Japanese troops will not be used for immediate southward advance but will remain on Hainan Island for training in subtropical conditions. Although the Japanese military strength on the South Island has increased, the guerrilla activity of the Chinese side has been on a larger scale since Christmas. Jiaji has been attacked by the Chinese many times, and Wenchang has also been attacked by the Chinese army. The guerrillas penetrated into Jiaji and attacked the Japanese military headquarters. Major General Inoue was injured by a hand grenade. At the time of the attack, Inoue was busy handling new affairs, which he had just taken over from Major General Yoda a few days ago. Dan County in the northwest, although in the hands of the Japanese army, the Dacheng gathering twenty miles south, which was seized from the Japanese army a month ago, is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The Japanese army attacked the city on New Year's Eve but was eventually repelled. Guerrilla warfare is also taking place in the southern part of the island. (International News Service, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Suffer a Terrible Defeat If It Invades the Dutch East Indies: Observations of the Dutch Consul in the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Dutch Consul General here, Schurman, said last night that the Dutch East Indies may very well welcome Japan's attempt to invade the area, because if Japan invades the Dutch East Indies, it may suffer an unprecedented defeat. Schurman also said that it is a complete fallacy to say that the Dutch have surrendered in the war, because there are still 60 million Dutch people in the colonies. We will fight to the end in this war. Most of the Dutch fleet, as well as land and air forces, have joined the British army. Our entire merchant fleet of 2.5 million tons is acting in accordance with this common goal. (United Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>US Purchases Mercury from Mexico to Prevent It from Flowing into Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news today, the United States will increase its purchases of mercury produced in Mexico in order to reduce the amount of the item flowing into Germany. A senior official told a United Press reporter that the more mercury we purchase, the less mercury the Axis powers will allow Japan to purchase. However, President Roosevelt acknowledged the importance of this fact during his conversation with reporters yesterday.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Examining Japan</h3>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act is currently under discussion in the U.S. Congress. Due to the renewed stubbornness of isolationists in recent days, it is expected that this bill will not be without obstacles in Congress. The idea of ​​modifying or restricting it is also possible. However, no matter how much the opponents insist on their views, the proposal to step up assistance to China and Britain is a universal demand of the United States. A strong stance on the Far East is especially a consistent proposition of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Even if the future application is bound to take some effort, the general trend is beyond doubt. The world can trust this point.</p>
<p>Under this attitude of the United States, all democratic countries and even anti-aggression people around the world feel greatly gratified. What kind of reaction will the aggressive countries that the U.S. authorities have severely criticized, especially Japan, which is specifically targeted, have to this heavy pressure? This is a very noteworthy issue. Konoe's criticism of the United States in his speech to financial representatives yesterday, and the discussions convened by Army Minister Tojo on the so-called "national emergency situation," can all give a glimpse of the Japanese side's movements. This is naturally not enough to represent the views of the entire country of Japan, but since the Japanese government is entirely under the control of extremists, there is absolutely no possibility of retreating or repenting. Even if the question of whether the Pacific storm will eventually break out is still listed as a question, comprehensively viewing the turbulent trend, it is undoubtedly getting closer and closer to that state.</p>
<p>Examining Japan's current situation, it is difficult for anyone to understand why it wants to engage in external adventures. The external actions around 1900 could still be excused by breaking the shackles of Japan's capitalist development; but today, forty years later, its economy and industry are in unprecedented decline and shrinkage. The mere words "natural aspirations" are absolutely insufficient to make the Japanese people deeply understand the necessity of this endless expansion. Ōkaku and Cen Sheng said, "There is no need to explain the reason for seeking to advance southward." Perhaps it is precisely because it is indeed impossible to explain! Since the United States has tightened economic sanctions, Japan's ruling and opposition parties have chanted the development of domestic resources to realize the self-sufficiency and self-supply of the three islands. Since there is still room for its own country to be developed, it can be seen that the previous theory of "Have-nots" and the demand for redistribution of resources were all deceptive talk. Furthermore, in terms of its evolutionary history over the past forty years: In the era of the "Conquest of Korea" theory, Japan regarded Korea as a lifeline that it was bound to obtain, and did not hesitate to launch two external wars and pay a heavy price to compete for it. After what it wanted was obtained, its target advanced to Northeast China; after it occupied Manchuria and controlled some rich areas of China, its greed leaped to Nanyang; if Nanyang were readily available, then what would follow would be the realization of what the Tanaka Memorial said, "Conquering Asia is the starting point for conquering the world." This gradually expanding and endless desire would not be surprising if it were an ancient barbarian tribe seeking to assert itself among barbarians. If a 20th-century country claiming to be a "first-class civilized country" cannot use "reason" to restrain its "desire," and it becomes an incredible act of imagination and violence, it is truly an astonishing thing. If today's Japan were truly like Alexander, invincible wherever he went, or Genghis Khan, with his spirit swallowing mountains and rivers, then the continuous growth of its desires might not be excessive; but now, even the war of aggression against China is admitted by the Japanese financial groups to be unwinnable, and internationally, apart from the left-right dependent Germany and Italy, there are no other allied countries. With the exhaustion and decline of the country, it wants to be an enemy of the world's democratic powers and regard the United States as the main target. Perhaps only scholars of mental illness can answer this reason. Under the strict news control of the Japanese government, one can occasionally see some sincere and dangerous arguments holding deep doubts. It is not necessary to mention the past events of Ozaki and Saito. Even recently, apart from the Mazhou talks, the Asahi Shimbun and even the Chugai Business News and other newspapers have also revealed pessimistic tones from time to time, expressing doubts about whether Japan can achieve its expected goals, and fearing that this year's economy will tend to be bankrupt. However, since the dissolution of political parties and the parliament is only like a sacrificial lamb, this kind of brilliant insight cannot be reflected from the people to the government. On the contrary, the extreme views of the Kokumin Shimbun, even though the Japanese authorities say that they cannot represent the official line, in fact coincide with the government's policies. The theory of preparing for war against the United States is one example. And recently, the hypocritical and absurd attitude of right-wing military politicians has exhausted their ability to act inwardly weak but outwardly stern. There is no force that can manage or control them. This is really the greatest danger in Japan. Looking back at the history of the Meiji Restoration, although military leaders advocating expansion, such as Yamagata Aritomo, were undoubtedly pivotal, steady and prudent politicians such as Ito Hirobumi also formed a balance with them. Therefore, they were able to avoid excessive haste and adventure, creating the golden age of Japanese imperialism. The Triple Intervention and the Treaty of Portsmouth were surprisingly able to see restraint and acceptance after victory. This must be attributed to the vision of people like Mutsu Munemitsu and Katsura Taro, who understood the principle of hating fullness and avoiding overflowing, and were unwilling to easily throw away the newly emerged Japanese national fortune. Comparing this with the current Japanese military politicians in power, the difference is certainly immeasurable, and at the same time, it is not difficult to understand the reasons for the different trends of their past and present rise and fall from here.</p>
<p>The competition between countries must ultimately be decided by their respective strengths. Empty and aggressive arguments can only stimulate the other party, increase arrogance and complacency, pursue empty fame, and sell real disasters. It is harmful and not beneficial to the fate of the country. There is no shortage of obvious examples to be found in history. Today, the Japanese ruling and opposition parties initially lack the emotion and determination to go to war with the United States, but some words and deeds seem to be accelerating the unfortunate arrival of the future between the United States and Japan. This is a contradiction and also the result of Japan's internal loss of normal rational control. At this time last year, someone raised the question of not understanding the "New Order in East Asia." Recently, it was discovered that the general public in their country is also at a loss for the meaning of the "New Structure." The center of national policy guidance is like this, and others can be known. Today, instead of rushing to respond to the firm policy of the United States, the Japanese authorities should first do more enlightenment work on the "New Order" and "New Structure" for the people, so as to test the reaction of the government's policies among the people. This weakness and shadow existing within Japan, the actual impact it has, is absolutely not something that the increasingly weakened isolationism of the United States can help it eliminate.</p>
<h3>### Repeatedly Suffered Serious Blows from Chinese Troops, Heavy Losses in Northern Jiangxi, Japanese Invade from Three Sides but Fail, Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Achieve Important Results</h3>
<p>Gao'an The Japanese army, after failing in northern Hunan and southern Hubei, attempted to move around in various parts of northern Jiangxi. Unexpectedly, they suffered another serious blow from the Chinese army, resulting in the victory of the northern Jiangxi war since the New Year. The Japanese army's decision to move was divided into three aspects, all launched on the morning of the 11th. One group crossed the river at Ya Potan, northeast of Fengxin, and advanced towards Hualingbei Li and the suburbs of Fengxin City. The Chinese army ambushed from all sides, and as a result, the Japanese army was ambushed, injuring most of them, and seized many spoils of war. Another group advanced from west of Nanchang towards Xishan in the Chinese direction. As a result, they were also ambushed by the Chinese, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. Another group of more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers advanced towards Dingfang, Xiangtang, and Shabutantan, southeast of Nanchang. Although the Japanese army once invaded, as a result, after the Chinese army counterattacked, they drove the invading Japanese back to their original places, and killed 400-500 Japanese soldiers. In summary, the Japanese army's move on the northern Jiangxi battlefield resulted in more than 1,000 casualties. Other seizures are still being checked. (15th dispatch)</p>

<h3>### Food Prices Soar in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou It is reported that food prices in Hankou have been unusually high recently. Many poor classes have been trapped in famine because of this, and social unrest has occurred, resulting in some civilians being shot and even more serious turmoil threatening. However, the local authorities have not been able to take special steps to eliminate this dangerous situation. At present, food prices, especially rice prices, have reached a peak. Although the authorities have issued announcements saying that they will take measures to prevent merchants from profiting, in fact, no methods have been adopted to suppress this terrible price soaring. Although in areas within 50 miles of Hankou, rice is only 20 yuan per dan, in Hankou city, first-class rice has been sold for 160 yuan per dan, and second-class rice has been sold for 130 yuan per dan. Church people have tried to transport in cheap rice for relief, but they have been stopped by the Japanese military authorities. (15th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>### Sichuan Administrative Meeting Opens Group Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing The Sichuan Provincial (3rd) (6th) (7th) (8th) (9th) Administrative Conference opened a grain group review meeting on the morning of the 14th. In the afternoon, the problem of local finance was discussed. Zheng, Deputy Director of the Financial Reorganization Office, presented a report on provincial and county finance, stating that the province's budget for this year has been decided not to exceed 150 million yuan. There are also two important measures for provincial finance. The first is the problem of converting grain tax to in-kind collection. The provincial government has now organized a committee to study the implementation methods in detail. The second is that the tax revenue in each county in the 29th year differs greatly, and there are still those that have not been collected. We hope that special attention will be paid. As for the reorganization of county finance, after adjustments, if it can be implemented in accordance with regulations, it is expected that revenue and expenditure can be balanced. The county budget has now been set at 120 million yuan. The source of this is, first, the income from public school properties in each county and city in the 29th year was more than 9 million yuan. After reorganization, 20 million yuan can be obtained in the 30th year. Second, the slaughter tax can be at least more than 35 million yuan. Third, the franchise fee was originally listed as more than 1 million yuan. If the collection and management methods are improved, it can be increased at least tenfold, and 15 million should be added. Together with other income, the income of each city in the 30th year should reach 120 million yuan. If the 138 counties in Sichuan are averaged, the burden of each county increasing by 80,000 to 100,000 yuan is not too much. As a result, except for counties in border areas, all other counties expressed that they could work hard to achieve it. Later, Director Hu Juewei presided over a discussion on the issue of collecting miscellaneous items. The attending committee members detailed their opinions on the benefits and difficulties of collecting in-kind items, and most believed that it was possible to try collecting rare items, which would not be difficult.

<p>Restricting Immigration, Preventing Smuggling</p>
<p>Hong Kong Hong Kong's first immigration bill, used to restrict Chinese immigrants, has been implemented today. Although there is no provision in the treaties signed between Britain and China to restrict Chinese people from entering the country, Chinese people entering Hong Kong will now require a permit. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the number of Chinese people entering Hong Kong has greatly increased, and Hong Kong's population has increased to 2.5 million. This increase in population has led to problems with food, housing, and medical care. It is said that British tax officials have discovered that the amount of narcotics transported into Hong Kong from North China and Taiwan is increasing daily. It is heard that Hong Kong's drug trafficking is supported by saboteurs. The Hong Kong High Court heard a case and found that Chinese women from Shanghai were carrying cocaine into Hong Kong. It is said that the drugs were transported in biscuit tins. This new immigration ordinance is designed to stop smuggling and prevent the entry of undesirable elements. Hong Kong's special police are continuing to search for saboteur groups. (15th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>European War Anecdotes (3) (10)</p>
<h3>Greek Politics and Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Greece is located in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula, with an area of only 50,000 square miles and a population of only 7.1 million. In terms of its actual strength, it has only 140,000 regular troops and 600,000 reservists. It has only about 430-500 various field guns, including mountain guns, and only about 100 aircraft, mostly old models. Such a small and weak country actually defeated Italy, a so-called first-class world power with a population of 43 million, which is truly worthy of maintaining the glory of its past history.</p>
<p>Greece occupied an extremely bright page in ancient European history, with a flourishing culture and remarkable military achievements. In 490 BC, the Persian Empire invaded Athens with a large army. The Greek general Miltiades led his troops to resist and defeated the Persian army at Marathon, which is said to be a famous battle in history. The victory won by the Greek army in Albania today can be compared with its previous glory.</p>
<p>Greece has barren land and lacks food. It occasionally relies on maritime trade to appear prosperous, but most of its ships are actually rented to Britain. Therefore, from an economic point of view, it is not enough to arouse the covetousness of ambitious people. However, its strategic location is crucial, making it a military stronghold, and therefore it is often subjected to foreign invasions. Thessaloniki in Greece is the back door to Central Europe and a springboard to the Dardanelles Strait and the Black Sea. From the Aegean Sea to the Turkish coast, Greek islands are scattered like stars. The Peloponnese Peninsula is close to Italy, and Crete is conveniently located midway between Greece and Africa. Greece controls two of the three routes for the German-Italian eastward advance.</p>
<p>The entire hub of Italy's plan to invade Greece was originally intended to pass through the Pindus region in northern Greece, down the Aoos River valley, in the hope of occupying Metsovo, which was the first goal of the Italian army. Then, the troops would be divided into two routes, one heading east to Kalabaka to spy on the Thessalian Plain, and the other heading west to Arta to join the army advancing along the Greek coast.</p>
<p>If this plan could proceed smoothly, the connection between the northern and southern parts of Greece would be cut off, and the Greek front-line troops would be isolated from their base, with the risk of being completely surrounded in Epirus.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Greek army preemptively seized the highlands near Lake Prespa and Lake Ventsiros, where the borders of Albania, Yugoslavia, and Greece meet, within a few days after the start of the war. The only two roads out of Koritsa were entirely under their artillery control, and the offensive of this Italian army was thus halted.</p>
<p>In the other two directions, the original battle plan was shattered because the Italian military command underestimated the enemy and underestimated the resistance of the Greek army.</p>
<p>In the Pindus region, the Italian army advanced along the Aoos River valley and had reached midway to Metsovo, with its vanguard reaching the Smalika heights. In Epirus, it had also reached the Kalamas River. However, at this time, the Greek army had amassed heavy troops and resisted bravely, preventing the Italian army from taking another step beyond the line, merely wasting countless bullets, and eventually becoming hungry and exhausted, surrendering and being trapped. The Greek army waited at leisure for the enemy's strength to be depleted and its morale to be weakened, and then took the opportunity to counterattack with irresistible force. In the Kalamas River area of Epirus, the Greek army's position was solid, and it guarded the fortress firmly, and the enemy's attempt to cross the river never succeeded.</p>
<p>The current Greek Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, Metaxas, was originally a pro-German figure during World War I. Unexpectedly, this decision turned him into a staunch anti-Axis figure. Six months ago, it was generally believed that Metaxas might not hesitate to sell himself out and lean towards Mussolini. However, Britain had learned its lesson from Norway and Belgium during World War I, and pressured Metaxas through King George II of Greece.</p>
<p>George II's father, King Constantine, lost his throne during World War I because of his suspected pro-German stance. Although George II had also abdicated once, he finally returned to the throne in 1935 due to his pro-British relations. This time, he naturally had to repay the favor and make a small contribution to Britain.</p>
<p>Former King Constantine was forced to abdicate in 1917 because he refused to participate in the Allied war, and fled with his eldest son, George. His second son, Alexander, was established as king, and the real power was in the hands of the pro-British Prime Minister Venizelos. Greece joined the Allied Powers at this time. In October 1920, Alexander died of a wound on his ankle caused by a monkey bite. Greece held a referendum, requesting Constantine to return to the country and restore the monarchy. Constantine returned to the country for two years, but finally could not settle down because Britain and France refused to recognize him, and his son, Prince George, succeeded to the throne. This new monarch was only in power for fifteen months, and was forced to leave the country due to disagreements with Venizelos, leaving the throne vacant. On March 25, 1924, the 103rd anniversary of Greek independence, the parliament announced that the monarchy would be changed to a republic at this time.</p>
<p>From 1923 to 1935, in this short period of eleven months, the Greek political system changed no less than twenty-five times, plus two short-lived dictatorships, one initiated by General Pangalos, which lasted for fourteen months before collapsing, and the other led by General Plastiras, which only lasted for fourteen hours before it came to an end. In October 1935, the Greek army launched a coup, supporting General Kondylis as prime minister and regent, abolishing the republic and restoring the monarchy. After considerable twists and turns, they welcomed George II back to the country. Both father and son, one had abdicated twice, and the other had ascended the throne twice, which can be said to be comparable to each other.</p>
<p>George II was originally a romantic emperor. During his twelve years of exile, he mostly lived in London. He often liked to go out for leisure walks in the evening, wandering the streets. Once, walking alone, he was favored by a goddess, which can also be said to be a romantic story of modern emperors. George also liked to socialize with aristocratic women, pleasing them in every possible way, which aroused the jealousy of the queen, and he announced his divorce upon returning to the country and resuming his position.</p>
<p>He is now of the age to know his destiny, has no children under his knees, and does not want to renew his marriage. There was a time when it was rumored that he had made a blood oath with the eldest daughter of the Earl of Craven. The woman's family denied the rumors on the one hand, but on the other hand said that she and George I had had a close friendship for fifteen years. The truth of the matter is not known to outsiders. When King Edward VIII of England was cruising the Adriatic Sea, George hosted a banquet to entertain him. The two were cousins. George invited Edward to the banquet alone, and Edward brought his lover, Mrs. Simpson, with him. Later, Edward invited George back, and George also brought his close friend. These cousins, one loved beauty more than the country, and the other loved both beauty and the country, which is truly wonderful in different ways.</p>
<p>George is not interested in family life or academic research. He likes to ride horses, and he also likes to drive cars at high speed on the streets. He also likes to hunt, dance, loves to listen to the premiere of the play, and loves to wear good clothes.</p>
<p>Since his father was forced to abdicate in 1917 and fled in a hurry, he often felt displaced in the eighteen years, except for a short period of being a puppet monarch (1922 to 1923). He once called himself "an unemployed person? Hoping to restore his original profession".</p>
<p>But in 1935, he suddenly felt that he had become an important figure in the country. The Greek Minister of the Army, Kondylis, was a pro-Italian figure, while George II advocated pro-British. The Prime Minister at the time, Tsaldaris, originally belonged to the Republican Party, but later suddenly changed and became a royalist. Finally, he pressured Kondylis to manipulate the referendum and welcomed George II back to the throne with a majority of 98%. He returned to Greece from London on November 25, 1935, and resumed his official duties.</p>
<p>Although George was restored to the throne, Greek politics remained chaotic. Kondylis was determined to be a dictator, and George was unwilling to be a puppet king, so he dismissed Kondylis and announced free elections. However, things got worse and worse. In the new parliament, the Venizelos faction and the anti-Venizelos faction were evenly matched, and the power to make decisions was in the hands of the fifteen communists. Venizelos and Tsaldaris died one after another, and no one assisted the constitutional government. George had no choice but to ask the Minister of the Army, Metaxas, to form a cabinet. Although the Metaxas faction only occupied seven seats in the parliament, he agreed without hesitation and did not decline. But fearing that the vote would be unfavorable to him, he suddenly ordered the dissolution of the parliament. The next day, he reorganized the cabinet, abolished political parties, and implemented strict inspections. By 1938, he had appointed himself as the lifelong prime minister. Although George wanted to make decisions independently, he still could not grasp the real power.</p>
<p>Metaxas is also deeply unpopular in the country. The political system he supports is neither a constitutional monarchy nor a dictatorship with some fascism. He governs the country with the king's orders, secret police, and youth movements. "The people have no freedom." The prime minister concurrently holds the posts of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force. There is also a small secret between him and George II. Although George is the head of a country, he often feels financially strapped. Therefore, he once signed an order to withdraw his salary for the years he was in exile. This handle fell into Metaxas's hands. George knew that if he turned against him, he would announce this secret, arousing public opposition. Therefore, he tolerated everything. Metaxas wanted to hold the Greek king hostage and monopolize the military and political power, probably all because of this.</p>

<h3>German and Italian Air Forces Attack British Escort Convoy in the Mediterranean; British Acknowledge Three Warships Damaged; Germany Uses Sicily as Air Force Base, British Aircraft Repeatedly Bombard It Heavily</h3>
<p>London - The British Admiralty announced that an Italian destroyer sank in the Strait of Sicily in the central Mediterranean on January 10. Subsequently, the British destroyer "Brazen", the aircraft carrier "Illustrious", and the cruiser "Southampton" were attacked by enemy aircraft and suffered minor damage. During the period from January 7 to 13, the British Navy was active in the central Mediterranean, escorting the convoy through the Mediterranean. On the morning of January 10, it encountered two Italian destroyers, one of which was sunk and the other escaped. Subsequently, the British ship "Brazen" was damaged by a mine or torpedo, but the ship has safely arrived in port. During the battle, German and Italian dive bombers, taking off from Italian bases, launched a large-scale attack on British ships. The British ship "Illustrious" was hit by a bomb and suffered minor damage, and some crew members were slightly injured. The British ship "Southampton" was also hit by a bomb and suffered some casualties. At least twelve enemy aircraft were shot down, and many others were damaged. However, the British escort convoy, which was in combat, has safely sailed from west to east, as planned, passing through dangerous areas. The convoy was carrying important materials to aid Greece. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - British Air Force bombers heavily bombed the port of Catania on the coast of Sicily on Sunday night, destroying nine German Junkers dive bombers. The German air force's "nest" in the Mediterranean, which aided Italy in attacking the British fleet, was severely punished. The announcement of the attack on Catania was made by Cairo last night. Since the Italian Air Force Chief of Staff announced on January 2 that German aircraft would participate in the "sea and air struggle in the Mediterranean", the German Air Force immediately launched attacks in the Mediterranean, with its departure point likely being the port of Catania. The Mediterranean base given to the German Air Force by Italy must be more than one place, and Sardinia is likely to be another German base. The British Air Force is currently paying attention to it. The British aircraft carrier "Illustrious", which was damaged by enemy aircraft in the central Mediterranean on January 10, had its naval air force and the air force on other British ships launch a major blow to the Italian Navy at Taranto. The "Illustrious" is one of Britain's newest aircraft carriers, with a displacement of 23,000 tons and carrying 70 aircraft. For the past three days, Axis news agencies have greatly exaggerated the German aircraft's participation in the Mediterranean war, even claiming that German aircraft hit two British aircraft carriers. On Friday night, the British naval air force launched a large-scale attack from aircraft carriers on ships in Palermo, Sicily. Also, the British cruiser "Southampton", which was damaged on January 10, has a displacement of 9,100 tons and was launched in 1936. At the beginning of the war, when German aircraft attacked the Firth of Forth, three crew members were killed or injured. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - A British Air Force Headquarters in the Middle East communique stated that 15 enemy aircraft were shot down, including nine German Junkers Ju 87 bombers destroyed during the bombing of the Catania airfield on the east coast of Sicily. The other six were destroyed by British aircraft bombing Benina in Libya. It is reported that there is nothing to report on land activities around Tobruk, but the concentration of troops and supplies is still in progress. It is generally believed here that the intensification of British air force activities may be the prelude to a final attack. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome - Rome Radio announced today that at least ten British ships were sunk in the German and Italian air raids in the Mediterranean over the weekend. An earlier Rome Radio report claimed that at least sixteen British warships were sunk or destroyed. Italy claims that the sunk British ships included four cruisers, three submarines, two transport ships, and one giant auxiliary cruiser. (International News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Italian-owned Sicily No Different than German Territory</p>
<p>Washington - According to sources in diplomatic circles here, Sicily has in reality become German territory. In recent weeks, the island has been occupied by a large number of German troops, air force personnel, and cavalrymen. Italy, seeking German assistance, fears that Germany will inevitably demand a political price, so it has remained silent for a long time. However, it finally stated that the current price paid by Italy seems to be that a large number of German troops have arrived in Trieste in northern Italy, where several German merchant ships are also docked in the port. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Reuters diplomatic correspondents learned this afternoon that the responsible parties here have not confirmed the claim that Italian-owned Sicily has actually been occupied by Germany. This news was transmitted by the United States, mainly because German air force personnel and ground service personnel have arrived at several airfields in Sicily. In fact, the British have already obtained reliable information that the German air force assisting Italy is using Sicily as a base. This can be seen from the communique announced by the air force that British aircraft destroyed nine German Junkers aircraft during the bombing of Catania. The fact that the German air force participated in the attack on the British convoy in the Strait of Sicily on January 10 also confirms this belief. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>British and Australian Forces Intensify Siege; Tobruk's Situation Becomes More Precarious; Royal Air Force Active in Eastern Libya; British Forces Attack Italian Positions on Moonlit Night in East Africa</h3>
<p>Cairo - British artillery is continuously bombarding the defenses of the Italian army in Tobruk. The army is also gathering in preparation for the final attack. The British Air Force is soaring over eastern Libya, west to Benghazi, without encountering any resistance. When the Italian army retreated, they did not destroy the airfields and landing fields, which is very helpful for the British Air Force to control most of Italian-owned Libya. British and Australian forces continue to move large cannons, tanks, and military supplies across the western desert to accelerate the fall of Tobruk. Wrecks of Italian aircraft shot down in recent engagements are often found. According to the Aviation Department, an Italian bomber in Sidi Barrani was damaged by British fighter planes and attempted to land at the airfield, but crashed just two yards outside the airfield. Three Italian crew members died. The pilot and the remaining crew members, as well as a team of Italian soldiers sent to rescue them, were all captured. The road from Sidi Barrani to Solum, which the Italian called "the Road to Victory", also has many marks left by the British Air Force, including a destroyed Italian bomber with its nose touching the ground and its fuselage standing upright. British forces also discovered Italian aircraft abandoned by the Italian army undamaged outside Solum. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>After the news of the great battle between the British and Italian forces in Khartoum, British-Egyptian Sudan, in the black night and the British victory reached here, it was reported today that a powerful British army has advanced into Italian-owned East Africa, Abyssinia, and Eritrea. Gallabat is adjacent to the scenic Faleq district in northwestern Abyssinia. The British army first launched a large-scale bombing of the heavily defended Italian positions in the area, and then provided artillery cover. When the two armies encountered each other, they engaged in a fierce bayonet fight. British mechanized units and infantry, aided by the clear African moonlight and under the cover of heavy artillery, attacked and occupied the Italian fortifications. According to reports, fierce battles took place in several closely spaced locations. Subsequently, the Italian army's resistance collapsed and they began to retreat, leaving behind at least sixty corpses. (International News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Italian General Captured</h3>
<p>Cairo - It has just been announced that Italian General Argentino has been captured by British forces besieging him about seven miles east of Tobruk. However, the circumstances of his capture have not yet been disclosed.

<h3>Greek Offensive Like a Hot Knife Through Butter; Advances Towards Berat; Italian Army Repeated Counterattacks Fail; Italian Nationals Begin Evacuating from Cities in Albania</h3>
<p>Athens - The Greek High Command announced today that a fierce battle took place north of Kleisoura in Albania this morning. The Italian army launched several counterattacks, but were repelled by the Greek army. The Italian army suffered heavy losses in manpower and materiel. British bombers flew over the Italian army and launched fierce and effective attacks on Berat, a heavily defended road junction. Berat is the key to the interior of Albania's southern coast. It is reported that British aircraft used bombs and machine guns to bombard the Italian army and its defense lines and transportation lines. The Greek army's advance towards Berat has the potential to encircle the flanks of the Italian defense forces north of Valona. When the Greek military spokesman spoke about the Italian army's counterattacks today, he believed that "although the scale of this offensive is small, it is very fierce." (International Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Athens - It was announced here today that the British launched a fierce and effective bombing of the winding city of Gonderat. At the same time, it was also reported that the Italian authorities are now evacuating residents from cities such as Berat, Valona, and Elbasan. Just as the Greek army was fiercely pursuing the Italian army that retreated from Kleisoura to Berat, the British Air Force stated that some targets in Berat and its surrounding traffic were fiercely bombarded on Sunday. Yesterday, the fighting between the Greek and Italian armies in Tepeleni was still taking place in heavy rain and sub-zero temperatures. News from the area said that the Greek army was climbing dangerous and extremely slippery mountain paths, and had forced the Italian army to retreat. However, the details of the reported advance are unknown. (International News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Athens - A Greek official spokesman said that the Italian army launched a small-scale counterattack yesterday, but was repelled and suffered heavy casualties. The Greek army captured some enemies and seized four Italian cannons, which were immediately used to bombard the enemy. An Italian aircraft was shot down by machine gun fire. Last night's communique announced that there was not much activity on either side. The Greek army made some minor captures. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Bulgaria Denies Foreign Troops Entering; Hungarian and Bulgarian Prime Ministers Urge Citizens to Prepare for Contingencies</h3>
<p>Sofia - Last night, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency was ordered to declare that no foreign troops have crossed the border into Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian government has not discussed this matter with any foreign government, because there is no reason to take this step. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Diplomatic sources report that the Soviet Union has informed Turkey that it firmly opposes Germany obtaining a foothold in Bulgaria. (International News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov both delivered speeches in their respective capitals yesterday. Local newspapers believe that the content of the two speeches is very similar, and that their main purpose is to urge citizens to prepare for any contingencies and to emphasize the need for each country to maintain its national identity. The unity of the countries of Southeast Europe can be clearly demonstrated here. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Situation in the Balkans Eases; British and German Activity in Ankara</h3>
<p>Ankara - According to senior Turkish officials, there is no reason for Turkey to worry about the recent rumors of German troop movements in the Balkan Peninsula and that German troops may be fighting the British in Greece. The situation in the Balkans is now "quite clear." Turkish authorities have declared that Turkey will not change its current attitude unless it is attacked. German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen is scheduled to meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu this morning. All parties are paying close attention. Von Papen met with Neuman, a senior official of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, yesterday. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Three senior military officers representing the British Middle East Command held lengthy talks with the Turkish General Staff in Ankara yesterday.

<h3>Luo's Dictatorial Prime Minister Reportedly to Visit Germany</h3>
<p>Southern Capital, Roman Capital - The Berlin correspondent of the Southern Capital Political Newspaper claims that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu will arrive in Salzburg from Romania tomorrow to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. This meeting will be strictly confidential. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital - Romanian officials neither confirm nor deny the rumor that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has been summoned to Berlin. News from the Romanian capital states that the Prime Minister was still in the capital yesterday morning. The Romanian Deputy Prime Minister and Iron Guard leader, Horia Sima, has convened representatives of the Iron Guard from various towns and cities for a meeting on the 19th of this month. Speakers will discuss "Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy striving to establish a new European order." Furthermore, the Romanian "Curentul" newspaper published an article arguing, in a tone of resistance, against Germany's plan to sacrifice Romania's development and turn it into its granary and oil depot, stating that the ruling authorities must not dream of abandoning Romania's industry. Not only should Romania's industry not be abandoned, but it should also be expanded. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>German Delegation Leaves Soviet Union for Home</h3>
<p>Moscow - The head of the German delegation and representative of the German Foreign Ministry, Schnorre, left here yesterday to return home. Those who saw them off at the station included the Deputy Commissioner of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, Kruglyakov, the Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry, Sobolev, the German Ambassador, and all members of the German Embassy. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Analyzes Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>Lyon - The Soviet semi-official news agency TASS issued a statement yesterday stating that "the Soviet Union neither knew nor agreed" regarding the entry of German troops into Bulgaria. "Le Temps" recently published an editorial that attaches great importance to this denial. The article states that the Soviet government's newspaper "Izvestia" recently published an article emphasizing that as long as countries do not directly or indirectly hinder the integrity and inviolability of the Soviet Union's borders, "we are willing to maintain a peaceful stance towards them." This, coupled with the aforementioned denial from TASS, shows that the Soviet Union has always been concerned about the fate of the Slavic peoples in the traditional spirit, without changing due to any political or ideological considerations. If we want to judge the situation in the Balkans, we must not ignore the South Slavic theory that the Russians have always advocated. In addition, when "Izvestia" commented on the economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, it stated that "we are willing to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with all countries bordering the Soviet Union, and at the same time, we are willing to establish diplomatic relations with all countries." The denial issued by TASS is consistent with this statement. Furthermore, the Soviet government has repeatedly stated that the German-Soviet agreement is not directed against any third country. "Izvestia" stated that "there is mutual trust and understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union, and no matter what problems arise in the future, solutions can be found under mutually beneficial conditions." In short, the deep meaning of Soviet policy is often easy to cause confusion. The above analysis should make it easier to see the truth behind all of Moscow's motives and reactions. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Bad Weather, London Quiet, British Aircraft Stop Activity</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday, German aircraft were not seen in the skies over London all day and all night. This is apparently due to bad weather at the German bases, as the English Channel was also shrouded in dense fog yesterday. Residents of Plymouth began to emerge from their basements yesterday after a three-hour air raid on Wednesday evening. The air raid on the city the day before, which began at dusk, was the most violent since the beginning of the war. The first wave of German planes, a total of thirty, first dropped incendiary bombs on the city. Men, women, and children fought against these fire-causing bombs, and the city was saved from a real disaster. However, major fires broke out in some areas, and a second wave of German planes concentrated their attack on the area, dropping tons of high-explosive bombs. Many houses and shops were destroyed, and a church was also destroyed in the air raid. (United Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>Australian Prime Minister's Tour of England</h3>
<p>London - Reuters has learned from Australian sources in London that Australian Prime Minister Menzies will travel to London. (Menzies will be the first Prime Minister of a Dominion to visit England since the start of the war.) This is by no means an indication that the Dominion Prime Ministers will hold an Imperial Conference. It is said that Menzies is eager to visit the "front line" in person to study the progress of the war. Although he will talk with Churchill and other key members of the British government, these talks will only relate to events related to Australia's contribution to the common war effort. Reuters has also learned from South African sources that the South African Parliament will soon convene in Cape Town, and it is unlikely that South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts or other important cabinet members will visit London in the near future.

<h3>Rumors of Further German and Italian Pressure on France, Demanding the Transfer of Fleets and Seaports - Berlin Officials Say They Know Nothing - Vichy Orders Abolition of Naval Conscription</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital - Diplomatic circles are rumored that Hitler and Mussolini were scheduled to secretly meet with French Army General Huntziger and Navy Chief Darlan at the German Head of State's residence in Berchtesgaden last night. If this rumor has any credibility, Germany and Italy may demand that France cede key naval ports in the western Mediterranean, such as Toulon in France, Bizerte in Tunisia, and the French fleet. However, Berlin officials claim that they know nothing about this meeting. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Vichy - French Prime Minister Pétain and Navy Chief Darlan jointly issued an order yesterday to place the French fleet under peacetime organization in accordance with the armistice agreement. This order abolishes the previous naval conscription system and replaces it with a five-year enlistment. However, the French Navy still possesses full strength, unlike the army, which has been completely disbanded, because, in accordance with the armistice agreement, France's overseas colonies must be protected by the navy.

<h3>Pro-British Sentiment Grows Among the French</h3>
<p>London - Minister of Information Cooper broadcast on Tuesday evening, stating that pro-British sentiment in France has greatly increased, and mentioned "absolutely accurate" evidence from above, proving that disappointment in France has been replaced by enthusiasm, and resentment has been replaced by reason. The French people also know that the only hope for France to gain freedom and independence in the future is the victory of Britain. Cooper also said that a young French man built a plane in a cowshed and flew it to Britain on a day when German planes were rarely seen due to storms and heavy rain. He landed safely and joined the Free French forces, fighting for the goals of the Allies. This young man's actions are just a faint reflection of what millions of brave French people are hiding in their hearts today, waiting for the opportunity to show what they support and wish victory to. Cooper continued to praise the Free French and their leader, General de Gaulle, saying that they sacrificed everything for the purpose they cherished most, the glorious principles deeply rooted in the souls of French soldiers and the love of freedom deeply rooted in the souls of French people who urge French soldiers to continue fighting. Their task is extremely difficult now, but on the day of victory, their task will gain the greatest glory. At that time, French people in exile will return to their country magnificently as conquerors, restoring the freedom that has been taken away from their fellow countrymen. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake on New Britain Island</h3>

<h3>The Deteriorating State of US-Japan Relations (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The Minai cabinet was formed, and Arita became Foreign Minister. He had long advocated a "Berlin-Rome Axis" policy and had no intention of continuing negotiations with Ambassador Grew. Before the collapse of the Minai cabinet last summer, Arita had almost concluded negotiations with Grew several times, but after Konoe reorganized the cabinet and embraced the Axis, the hope of such negotiations vanished. Until the last three months, although Matsuoka and Grew had several very frank talks, they only recognized that the rift between the two countries was deepening.</p>
<p>Under Japan's strict censorship system, local newspapers are not allowed to publish a word about any contact between the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and officials of the Foreign Ministry, or any conversations between the Dutch Minister and Japanese officials, and even sending telegrams abroad is prohibited. Even the American-owned Japan Advertiser (now bought by the Japanese and merged with the Japan Times) was banned from publishing because it published a guest list of US Ambassador Grew in the social news column, listing US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Matsuoka himself originally had no objection to the publication of his name, but the Information Department insisted that the newspaper had violated the ban and should be punished. All Americans in Japan were originally very uneasy about the situation. After the US State Department advised them to withdraw, they cleared their business and hurried home, but their attitude was calm and not panicked. The US Consul General in Tokyo estimates that there are more than 6,000 US citizens residing in Japan, more than 4,000 of whom are Japanese who have become US citizens, and most of them will not leave Japan. As of now, more than 1,000 American citizens have withdrawn and returned home. They had long been preparing to return home because they felt that daily life was difficult, with shortages of daily necessities such as coal, gasoline, butter, bread, metal products, and imported goods, and luxury goods being banned.</p>
<p>The interference of the Japanese police, especially the military police, is of a very serious nature. This kind of terrorist action is undoubtedly aimed at foreigners, and contact between Japanese and Americans has become prohibited. Japanese people do not dare to associate with foreigners other than those from Germany and Italy, otherwise they will be suspected and questioned. The Japanese authorities warned people not to contact foreigners or work for foreigners, which has now taken effect.</p>
<p>Recently, anyone who goes to the British and American embassies has been arrested, interrogated, and detained for several days. The British and American embassies have protested to the Japanese side about this.</p>
<p>In short, the state of terror in Japan is difficult to describe in a few words. All foreigners, except for those from Axis countries and diplomatic officials who will not be arrested, are uneasy and wary of being arrested and imprisoned at any time.</p>
<p>British and American citizens are discussing how to leave if Japan and the United States go to war this spring. Diplomats can safely leave Japan on an "ambassador ship" at that time, but it is uncertain whether other citizens can board the "diplomatic ship" at the last minute to return home. Many American citizens are considering whether they will be confined or held hostage in the event of war, so that they can be exchanged for Japanese citizens in the United States. In fact, the number of Japanese citizens in the United States is two hundred times the number of American citizens in Japan. As for British citizens, if war breaks out between Britain and Japan, because they have no US dollars or Canadian dollars in their accounts, they cannot go to the Americas, and most of them will retreat to Australia, which belongs to the Sterling Area, to seek refuge.</p>
<p>The unease felt by Chinese citizens in the United Kingdom is not purely due to the political situation, but also because Japan is an island nation, and if a war breaks out in the Pacific, there will be no way to avoid the suffering of artillery fire. Therefore, most of them follow the advice of the British government and calmly implement the withdrawal. (End)</p>

<h3>Abolition of the Title of Head Teacher in Secondary and Higher Schools, Ministry of Education Orders National Education Departments and Bureaus to Comply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to forward it to secondary and higher schools nationwide, stating that the head teacher stipulated in the Outline of the Teacher System for Secondary Schools, in the Supplementary Measures for the Administrative Organization of Secondary Schools, which was revised and added by the Ministry, is required to concurrently serve as the Director of Student Affairs or the Head of the Student Affairs Section. Although the powers and responsibilities are clearly defined, the titles are repetitive and not very necessary. After a recommendation by the Guidance Conference convened by the Ministry in October 1940, it was approved to abolish the title of head teacher in secondary and higher schools. All matters related to school-wide guidance shall be the responsibility of the Director of Student Affairs or the Head of the Student Affairs Section, who shall be responsible for their duties.

<h3>The Teachers' Strike at Xingzhong School Resolved Satisfactorily Yesterday, Mediation by Relevant Parties, Normalcy Restored Today</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Some faculty and staff members of the private Xingzhong Primary and Secondary School at the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Xue Huali Road in the city submitted six demands to the school due to meager treatment and difficult living conditions, causing a teachers' strike that lasted for four days and remained unresolved. Since the occurrence of this incident, relevant educational parties have sent personnel to mediate. Yesterday, they summoned both parties for sincere talks, urging them to consider the overall situation and restore the school to normal. The various parties involved deemed it satisfactory, and the strike was completely resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Going to Extremes, the Situation is Serious</p>
<p>The teachers and staff of the school originally made six demands to the school, including (1) paying double salaries for the current month of this semester, (2) increasing salaries by 50% from the next semester, (3) calculating salaries for six months from the next semester, (4) not dismissing teachers without cause, (5) not arbitrarily insulting teachers, and (6) providing rice subsidies for non-boarding teachers, etc. The school stated that the salaries of the teachers had been increased every semester, and the school's funds were not very sufficient. They believed that the conditions proposed by the teachers were unacceptable and published a public response in the newspaper. The wording was slightly lacking in consideration. The striking teachers then took the students' examination papers and grade books and left the school together, further escalating the situation. Another group of teachers and staff expressed their dissatisfaction with the actions of the striking teachers and published a statement in the newspaper expressing their attitude towards this unfortunate incident. The striking teachers then issued an appeal declaration, and the situation became very deadlocked, causing concern in all sectors of society. The relevant educational parties, due to their positions, were running around day and night, doing their best to mediate, but there was no progress in the past three days.</p>
<p>The Mediation Process, Full of Twists and Turns</p>
<p>At the beginning of the mediation by the relevant educational parties, the school principal believed that the conditions proposed by the teachers were impossible to accept and there was no room for negotiation. The striking teachers had already left the school, expressing their determination. Therefore, the mediation work could not be started. They then explained the righteousness to the school principal, ordering him to consider the teachers' difficult living conditions, which were indeed a fact. For the sake of the school's future, the door to negotiations could not be closed, and he was immediately ordered to notify the teachers to listen to mediation and not to remain in a deadlock. They then summoned the teachers and gave them a serious warning, telling them not to use strikes as a means to demand improved treatment, and ordered them to resume work immediately. The teachers were also able to comply with the administrative orders. The relevant parties then sent personnel to accompany them to the school at 1:00 pm yesterday to meet with the principal and begin negotiations on the conditions. Fortunately, both parties had some understanding, and with the persuasion of the administrative personnel, everything went smoothly and was resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Negotiations Completed, Normalcy Restored</p>
<p>As a result of the negotiations, the school accepted the following three conditions: (1) increasing salaries by 20% to 40% from the next semester, (2) not transferring teachers without cause, and (3) all teachers can stay in the school. The teachers were generally satisfied with the negotiations so far, but the school was unable to bear the cost of calculating salaries for six months, so it was agreed to calculate salaries for five and a half months, which has not yet been fully decided, but both parties have agreed that the relevant parties will be responsible for resolving it. Therefore, school affairs immediately returned to normal, and the principal and teachers were reconciled as before. A storm has ended with this result. The relevant parties and people from all walks of life expressed great satisfaction that both parties were able to consider the overall situation and understand the righteousness. As for the matter of calculating salaries for six months, the relevant parties will issue an order for compliance as soon as a decision is made, and no party shall hold any other objections.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Tournament, Huaxing Won Against Liangxi Again Last Night, Military Officers Won Against Shangxing, Little Bears Won Against Giants</h3>
<p>Three Xiqing basketball games were held last night. The game between Shangxing and the military officers could have been evenly matched, but because Da Mao was unable to play due to injury, the team lacked leadership and its strength was greatly reduced, resulting in a one-sided game. At the end of the first half, the military officers had twenty-four points, while Shangxing had only six points. The final score was fifty for the military officers and eighteen for Shangxing. In the second game, Huaxing played against Liangxi. Huaxing is a perennial winner of the Chinese team, while Liangxi is gradually improving. As a result, the Xiqing stadium was packed last night. Unfortunately, Wang Zhongzhong and Nan Zhen have returned to their hometowns, and their strength has been greatly reduced. After the battle, Huaxing's shots were like a string of beads, and Liangxi had almost no chance to fight back. At the end of the first half, the score was thirty-five to eleven. During the second half, Huaxing's Jiang Xuechong and Hong Bin retired one after another, and Liangxi took the opportunity to advance. Sure enough, the situation changed, and the points soared. When the score was forty-four to twenty-nine, Liangxi was only fifteen points behind. Huaxing brought on Jiang Xuechong, Hong Bin, and others, and the game continued until the end. Huaxing won with a score of fifty-eight to forty-one. In the last game, the Little Bears played against the Giants. The Little Bears won twenty-six to twenty-one. In the first half, the Little Bears also took the lead with a score of fourteen to nine.</p>

<h3>With the End of the Lunar Year Approaching, Labor and Management Should Understand and Cooperate; Labor Disputes in Various Industries Should Be Resolved Promptly; As the Cost of Living Rises, Wages Should Also Be Adjusted</h3>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, employers in various industries are busy settling accounts, and employees are scrambling to secure funds for the New Year. However, due to the high and unabated prices of goods, there are many disputes between labor and management regarding future wages. Prolonged contention is not beneficial for either party. Yesterday, there were several labor disputes. All sectors hope for harmonious cooperation to resolve these issues quickly and overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Telegraph Company Messengers Demand</p>
<p>All messengers from the American Pacific, British, Great Eastern, and Danish Great Northern submarine telegraph companies on Avenue Edward VII previously requested improved compensation from the company authorities, but a satisfactory resolution was not reached. Yesterday, messengers from the Coastal, Global, and American telegraph companies also joined, with a total of six telegraph companies' messengers jointly submitting five demands to the respective telegraph companies. Their original petition stated: "We, the messengers, are deeply grateful for the patronage we have received since joining the company. However, due to the rising cost of goods, we are unable to make ends meet despite our diligent work. With the New Year approaching, our living expenses are increasing. This situation is unbearable. Therefore, we are compelled to unite all messengers from the six companies and jointly request the following five points from your esteemed office. We earnestly request your office to carefully consider and approve: (1) A year-end bonus for 1940 equivalent to one month's salary, including allowances for rent, rice, and cost of living, plus a special bonus of 100 yuan per person; (2) A salary increase of at least 15 to 20 yuan starting from January 1941; (3) A housing allowance (including water and electricity) of 30 yuan starting from January 1941; (4) Starting from January 1941, the company will subsidize the rice price if it exceeds 20 yuan per picul, with a limit of one picul per person; (5) Starting from January 1941, in addition to the previous 50% salary increase, an additional 80% increase will be granted. We hope that the above five points will be approved and a definite response provided within three days, so that the messengers can serve with peace of mind and alleviate the urgent situation and avoid unnecessary complications." The petition was submitted in six copies to the authorities of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, Pacific, Global, Coastal, and American telegraph companies. It is understood that the company authorities understand that the messengers' actions are purely aimed at improving compensation and increasing wages. Therefore, they are likely to resolve the messengers' demands satisfactorily in the coming days.</p>
<p>Barbers' Strike Unresolved</p>
<p>A portion of barbers in the Shanghai International Settlement suddenly went on strike the day before yesterday. The reason is that the traditional practice is for barbers and barber shops to split the business income with a 30/70 split (labor/management). The barbers requested to adjust this to 40/60 (labor/management) due to the high cost of living. The capital refused to allow the change, which led to the strike, and it has not yet been resolved. Yesterday morning, dozens of striking barbers gathered and forced the barber shops along Gordon Road that were still operating to close down and join the strike. This was discovered by the relevant police department, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest 17 of the leading barbers. They were taken back to the police station, and because they were suspected of disrupting public order, they will be transferred to the First Special District Court today for punishment.</p>
<p>Commercial Dispute Urgently Needs Mediation</p>
<p>Since the Commercial Press labor-management dispute sent an urgent telegram to General Manager Wang in Hong Kong for a final appeal the day before yesterday, a reply has been received from Hong Kong yesterday, indicating that it will no longer be considered. The Tongren Association convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon and decided to telegraph General Manager Wang in Hong Kong again, hoping that the Tongren Association's purpose and the future of the dispute were not optimistic. It is hoped that both labor and management can handle it carefully and prevent the situation from escalating, which would be a blessing for the cultural and educational circles. A reporter from Xin Sheng News also learned from the capital side of the company that they also received a telegram from General Manager Wang yesterday, which stated: "Having received telegrams from the Shanghai office and representatives of the Tongren Association, it is regrettable that the Tongren Association does not understand the company's difficulties after the issuance of notices No. 372 and 373 by the head office. The company's current situation is critical. After years of consideration, Yunwu could not bear to see the company and the Tongren Association perish together, and had no choice but to make the decision to adopt the methods in the two notices. The company has done its utmost to treat the retained, transferred, and dismissed colleagues fairly. Now, I sincerely advise my colleagues that if you want to maintain the survival of our company and the livelihoods of the majority of colleagues, and to obtain the greatest possible special preferential treatment for the minority of dismissed colleagues, you can only accept the methods determined by the company this time. Otherwise, the company will not be able to survive, and the Tongren Association will not be able to obtain special preferential treatment for all unemployed people. My colleagues are all reasonable, and I hope you will appeal to reason and conscience. A change of mind will benefit both parties."</p>
<p>Post Office Issues Bonuses</p>
<p>The year-end bonuses for all employees of the Shanghai Post Office have been approved by the General Post Office at 75% and are scheduled to be officially distributed to each employee on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>HSBC Shop Assistants Request</p>
<p>More than a hundred shop assistant trainees from the British-owned HSBC bank in Shanghai suddenly requested an increase in rice subsidies from the bank authorities yesterday afternoon around 2 p.m. due to the rising cost of goods and difficult living conditions. After a third party came forward to mediate, they agreed to resume work first and then discuss the matter at length. They resumed work about half an hour later. It is understood that the labor dispute had not been resolved by the evening.</p>
<h3>Millions of US Dollars in Relief Supplies Set to Depart for China</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Shanghai branch of the American Red Cross, relief supplies donated by the American people are continuously being transported by sea to Burma and then by the Burma Road to Free China. Although the Burma Road has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, this transport has never been obstructed. Recently, 50 trucks loaded with medical supplies have passed through and safely arrived in the rear, ready for distribution to medical organizations. The medical organizations are greatly encouraged by this news, as they feel a great lack of such supplies. The American people have been very enthusiastic in donating relief funds, and relief supplies worth one million US dollars have been purchased and are about to depart for China. It is also said that Dr. Baker's advocacy has contributed significantly to the success of the American fundraising efforts. Therefore, various charitable organizations in Shanghai have decided to host a banquet for Dr. Baker on the 17th, and welcome outsiders to join the meal at their own expense.</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year Approaching, Security Measures Increased</h3>
<p>The security authorities of the two settlements in Shanghai, in view of the approaching Lunar New Year and the ninth anniversary of the Shanghai War on January 28th of the Lunar calendar, and the fact that various industries are busy with year-end closings and account settlements, making it easy for bandits to covet and rob them of their money, have specially dispatched Chinese and Western armed detectives to patrol commercial areas and key transportation routes in teams to protect safety and maintain good public order. The barbed wire fences on the borders have been repaired and restored to their original configuration. However, there are no plans to implement a blockade. As for the roads in the illegal road construction area across the boundary, because gambling is rampant in the area, at the intersection of Foch Road and Avenue Haig, and at the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour and Route des Soeurs, in addition to the construction of tortuous barbed wire fences, vehicles must detour, and armed detectives and French soldiers are stationed there with machine guns and other weapons to check pedestrians and vehicles to prevent and control crime.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Increase in Gas Surcharge, Effective from February 15th, Increased to 250 Percent</h3>
<p>According to a statement from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, the Shanghai Gas Company has recently applied to the Municipal Council to increase the gas surcharge to raise funds, due to the high price of fuel and other increased operating expenses. According to the company's application, the increase in operating expenses urgently requires increased revenue to offset them. The largest increase in expenses is for fuel, estimated to cost 5,016,440 yuan in the first half of this year, compared to only 2,708,132 yuan in the same period last year. Due to the high cost of living, it is necessary to increase allowances for employees. In addition, expenses such as imported materials and freight must be paid according to foreign exchange rates, resulting in significant increases in expenditure. The case has been discussed at a meeting of the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee, which believes that the request is reasonable and should be approved to increase the gas surcharge from 158 percent to 250 percent from February 15th for a period of three months, at which time it will be reconsidered. In addition, several proposed amendments to the conditions of gas supply, such as the minimum monthly charge for domestic users should be equal to the cost of 1,500 cubic feet of gas, and the minimum monthly charge for industrial users should be equal to 20 percent of the gas meter capacity, have also been approved. The above recommendations have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Rumor of Eight Bombs Found Near Japanese Naval Barracks, but Huishan Police Deny the Report, Saying Only One Old-fashioned Hand Grenade Was Found</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an English-language evening newspaper reported that eight bombs were found by the Japanese Marines on Fairyland Road. According to reporters, police officers at the Huishan Police Station in the area stated that this was not true. According to what they knew, a Jewish child found an old-fashioned hand grenade at the location, took it home, and then his family turned it over to the police station for safekeeping. The English-language Da Mei Evening Post stated that the Japanese Marines discovered eight bombs in a broken house next to the Japanese naval barracks on Fairyland Road yesterday (the 14th). The Marines then managed to remove them. When the news first came out, it was generally mistaken that the bombs had been placed there by terrorists intending to harm the Japanese army, but this morning (the 15th), authoritative sources indicated that the bombs were probably left behind by the Chinese army during their retreat in 1937, confirming the actual source of the explosives.</p>
<h3>Police Department Takes Over White Russian Regiment</h3>
<p>Hat badges and emblems have all been replaced; Garrison defenses have also been supplemented</p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of the White Russian Regiment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to the Police Department, the Pingming News reporter learned from relevant sources in the Corps headquarters yesterday that the transfer of the White Russian Regiment has been implemented from midnight yesterday (the 15th), but there was no ceremony. Before 12 o'clock last night, the orders for the White Russian Regiment were still directed by Corps Commander Hembel, but since midnight last night, they have been directed by Police Commissioner Bown.</p>
<p>The Regiment Commander Pays Farewell Visit to the Commander</p>
<p>After the change of command, the name of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps White Russian Regiment has been eliminated and has become a trace in the history of the Shanghai Municipal Council. From now on, the White Russian Regiment has become police officers of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and its name is the White Russian Reserve Team. The regiment commander, Ivanoff, paid a special visit to Corps Commander Hembel at 11 a.m. yesterday to say goodbye. All the military supplies of the White Russian Regiment have been transferred, and the two White Russian staff members in the headquarters have also been transferred to the Police Department to serve. From midnight last night, the hat badges, shoulder patches, and buttons of the White Russian Regiment were all changed to the special emblems of the Police Department.</p>
<p>English and Americans Replace Russian Regiment's Defenses</p>
<p>According to the Pingming News reporter, the White Russian Regiment, under the command of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps headquarters, was still responsible for the defense of the Waibaidu Bridge along the Suzhou Creek. Now that the White Russian Regiment has become police officers, the defenses of the Waibaidu Bridge that it left behind have been taken over by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Therefore, the headquarters of the four Volunteer Corps decided to have English and American volunteer members take over the defenses. Starting yesterday, members of the American "B" Company took over the defenses, and starting today, the English "A" Company took over. In the future, English and American volunteer members will take turns defending.</p>
<h3>Hong Shih-hao, Lawyer, Can Apply for Hong Kong Entry Permits on Your Behalf</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong British authorities have promulgated restrictions to prevent undesirable elements from entering the country. This has been reported in the previous newspaper. It has now been found that the Hong Kong government's immigration office has officially commissioned Mr. Hong Shih-hao, a lawyer who has been practicing in Shanghai for a long time and enjoys a good reputation, to handle the matter. All the forms have been printed. In the future, anyone who wants to go to Hong Kong must find a guarantor, bring a half-length photo of 2 inches, fill in the application form, and pay the fee. Mr. Hong will then submit it to the Hong Kong British authorities. Once approved, it will be distributed. This round-trip procedure takes about two to three weeks. The cost varies depending on the length of stay in Hong Kong. However, if those going to Hong Kong have urgent circumstances, they can explain the reasons. Mr. Hong has the right to issue temporary entry permits.</p>
<h3>Xiangtai Vessel Released After Being Detained for Half a Year, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British-owned Xin Xiangtai vessel, which had been detained near Zhoushan for nearly half a year, was released and returned to Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 14th. It is temporarily berthed at the Roosevelt floating pontoon. The vessel is loaded with a large quantity of charcoal and native paper. Because the formalities with the Japanese side have not been completed, it cannot be unloaded temporarily.</p>
<h3>Twelve French Nationals in Shanghai Head to Hong Kong to Join the Special Forces; Led by the Former Head of the French Police; British Military Attaché in Shanghai Accompanies Them to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening Post reported that yesterday at noon, twelve French nationals in Shanghai, led by former Deputy Director of the French Police Service Qiaoboshi, took the Taikoo Company's Haikou vessel to Hong Kong to join General Tegor's Free French Army. In total, sixty-five people have left Shanghai to join General Tegor, more than double the number who left Shanghai to fight before France surrendered last summer. Qiaoboshi served as Deputy Director of the French Police Service for five years and resigned last year. He joined the Tegor movement when it was launched in Shanghai last summer. When he resigned, the French in Shanghai were quite dissatisfied with him. He has four children who are still in Shanghai. In addition, British Military Attaché to Shanghai Mr. Spooke-Hot also took the vessel to Hong Kong yesterday to join the British combat troops. Mr. Spooke-Hot is well-known throughout Shanghai. He came to China in 1913 and served as an interpreter at the British Embassy in Beijing. When the European War broke out, he returned to his country to fight in France. Later, he was transferred to Egypt and served in Tripoli. After the war, he was reassigned as an attaché to the Allied Military Commission. He then came to China and served as a major in the British Army in Tianjin. Later, he was transferred to the British General Staff in Hong Kong, and then served as the Commander of the Artillery in Singapore, and then came to Shanghai as a military attaché. It is understood that some British volunteers in Shanghai will leave for Hong Kong with a group of British residents in Tianjin at the beginning of next week to join the British Army. The exact number has not yet been determined, but the British volunteers in Shanghai will leave Shanghai one after another to join the army in their respective locations.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Should Be Reassessed; No Delay Permitted</h3>
<p>Since the price of rice in the producing areas has fallen sharply, the goods have arrived in an endless stream, and the authorities have used the law to impose sanctions on speculation beyond the limit, the wind has temporarily calmed down, and not only those who hold a large amount of spot goods are intimidated, but the citizens are also greatly relieved. Generally, the public hopes that the authorities can take resolute action to relieve the long-term hardship. Therefore, the market price has gradually fallen, and in the past three days, it has fallen to three or four yuan within the limit price, setting a precedent for this serious problem in the past year. The citizens believe that since the facts have gradually become clear, it may be possible to bring it into the right track and there will be no more abnormal actions as before. However, if you want to maintain this good phenomenon, you have to rely on the Rice Assessment Committee to quickly reassess the rice price, so as to be able to solve all problems once and for all. Do not hesitate for a moment, for if there is any delay, speculators can use other methods to continue to control and hoard. Generally, rice merchants believe that since there is a limit price as a range, although the spot price has fallen within the limit price, they are determined not to trade at the price within the limit price and lose their illegal profits. Indeed, good times do not last long. Yesterday and today, the price of foreign rice is still within the limit price, but it has risen again compared with the previous day. If the Rice Assessment Committee remains silent and does not set a new price, the price will inevitably rise to the edge of the limit price in the coming days, because this kind of price increase is not illegal as long as it does not break the limit price. Although people from all walks of life have repeatedly called for it, the authorities cannot punish it by law. Therefore, whether the public food problem will become serious again depends entirely on whether the Rice Assessment Committee can quickly deal with it and catch up quickly.</p>

<h3>The United States Will Build 200 Cargo Ships with 300 Million US Dollars; 100 Ships Will Operate on the Far East Route; Can Be Converted into Military Transports When Necessary</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, American shipping has flourished due to the suspension of shipping by the belligerent countries. Sources in the shipping industry have learned that American shipping will become even more developed in the future and will dominate the world. The shipping on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans will be controlled by the United States. President Roosevelt's plan to build 200 cargo ships of 7,500 tons each with 300 million US dollars has already begun.</p>
<p>Completion Within the Year</p>
<p>It is expected to be completed within one year. According to recent news from the United States, another 35 million US dollars has been allocated to the Shipping Committee to build shipyards. After the ships are completed, half of them will be used to assist the United Kingdom, and the other half will be used exclusively for carrying cargo between the United States and the Far East, on the one hand to replace British ships in maintaining the Far East shipping industry, and on the other hand to engage in competition in the Pacific shipping. It is believed that once a war breaks out in the Pacific, these ships can be converted into military transports to travel between the United States and its defense areas, so their nature is extremely important.</p>
<p>Current Shipping Status</p>
<p>The American President Mail Line, which is still the giant of American Far East shipping, will continue to expand its existing plans step by step. The new giant ships of the World class, which were built with 100 million US dollars, include not only the President Jackson, which has passed through Shanghai and returned to New York, and the President Monroe, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 5th of next month, but also the five remaining ships, President Adams, President Hayes, President Van Buren, President Polk, and President Garfield, which will be completed one after another and will operate regularly to various parts of the Far East. Each ship weighs 16,900 tons and has a net weight of 9,400 tons, which are the largest of the American Mail Line's ships. There are also two ships of the same type as the President Coolidge and four Pacific shipping ships that are under construction.</p>
<h3>Yongfeng and Maller Ships, Export Interrupted</h3>
<p>The German Jiangding ship was previously sailing to Haikou when it was blocked and turned back on the Zhejiang ocean surface. It is now learned that the ship has reached an agreement with the Japanese side and decided to sail to Haikou again. The ship has been berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf yesterday and is planning to start loading cargo. It will leave Shanghai in the coming days. The Yongfeng and Maller ships were prevented from loading cargo. The ship ignored the Japanese obstruction and continued to load cargo for export. When it arrived at the Wusongkou, the Japanese side detained the ship. The ship is now anchored in the Jiangmian of the 16th Pu, and there is a Japanese yacht monitoring it.</p>
<h3>The First Special District Joint Association Publicly Announces to Reduce New Year's Eve Dinner Expenses and Help with Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizen's Federation issued an earnest public announcement yesterday, urging people from all walks of life to reduce the cost of the New Year's Eve dinner and donate to winter relief efforts. It stated that time flies like an arrow and it is again the end of the Lunar Year. The Shanghai custom is to eat New Year's Eve dinner. Friends and relatives entertain each other, which costs a lot. However, a reunion dinner is, of course, a common human sentiment, but a few dishes are enough to express joy and connect feelings. If you seek to be too sumptuous, at this time when the streets are full of cold and hungry people, how can you bear to eat it? Therefore, we earnestly appeal to all companies, stores, factories, families, and individuals to be considerate of the difficult times, do their best to reduce the cost of the New Year's Eve dinner, and donate it to the winter relief needs of various charitable organizations to benefit the poor people on the streets. We pray for this.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of the National Recovery Bonds to Be Paid at the End of February</h3>
<p>The tenth redemption of the principal of the 25th year of the Republic of China National Recovery Bonds has been drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on the 10th of this month. Regarding the payment method for the principal and matured interest of the drawn bonds, the Central Bank has recently been ordered to pay the bills jointly with the China and Transportation Banks starting on February 18th. The principal is 2.72 million yuan, and the interest is 9,608,400 yuan, for a total of 12,328,400 yuan. The principal and interest fund was originally allocated from the customs surplus. After the tariff in the occupied area was intercepted, in order to maintain the creditworthiness, it was changed to be paid by the Central, Communications, and Agriculture Banks.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Remit 40,000 Yuan to Relieve the Rice Shortage in Zhenhai</h3>
<p>The Zhenhai Shanghai Compatriot Disaster Relief Committee held a solicitation meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday, the 15th, on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association. More than 50 people attended. Yu Qiaqing presided over the meeting. Fang Jiaobo first reported that 116,000 yuan had been received in donations as of today. Zhenhai has donated a rice fund, and Shanghai has remitted 300,000 yuan. Wu Yaqin reported in detail the number of donations from each household. Yan Fang proposed that the donations have been collected and that, in addition to the 80,000 yuan that had been remitted previously, another remittance should be made. It was decided to remit another 40,000 yuan and to pay the finance committee members Sheng Ansun and Liu Pinsan to remit it within the donations. Next, the methods for carrying out the solicitation were discussed. It was decided to send letters to the solicitation committee members and actively promote it and issue propaganda texts to promote it. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry to Discuss Year-End Settlement Methods Tomorrow</h3>
<p>As the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China approaches, the silver and money industries and other industries are beginning to handle the settlement. In addition to deciding to operate as usual on New Year's Eve (January 26th), the Silver and Money Industry Association will decide on the receipt time, deposit interest, etc. at a meeting tomorrow. Factories, firms, and companies have rushed to complete the year-end settlement. During this period, all external transactions are suspended, and personnel are dispatched to collect the loans that have been issued previously. Due to the settlement, speculation has slightly subsided in various commodities and speculative markets, and the entire finance remains stable. (1) After the Qianye Association resolved that January 26th would be the end of the settlement period, all banks have handled the settlement with their counterparts, and the interest on deposits will be settled up to the 20th, but the interest on arrears will be calculated as usual. The foreign exchange market in the Qianye market will be open until the 25th. The bills on New Year's Eve will be resolved as soon as they arrive. (2) The banking industry settles at the end of June and the end of December. During the general settlement period of various industries, it is only busy with receipts and disbursements. All loans are not limited to being repaid before the end of the Lunar Year, and reasonable loans are still granted to various industries as needed, but mortgage loans are the main focus.</p>
<h3>Honda Passes Through Shanghai on His Way Back to Japan; Japan Imposes Martial Law Again; Suzhou Creek Bridges Were Closed Yesterday and Today; Special Martial Law Implemented in the Hongkou District</h3>

<h3>Bishop Geddes' Visit to Zhejiang: A Personal Account of the Severe Disaster Situation in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-based English newspaper, *North-China Daily News*, reports that Bishop Geddes, a foreign missionary, recently returned from a trip to Zhejiang Province. He provided detailed accounts of the recent conditions in Zhejiang Province. Bishop Geddes left Shanghai on October 22nd to inspect major cities in Zhejiang Province. The main news he brought back concerns events that transpired at the end of October.</p>
<p>Local Losses</p>
<p>According to Bishop Geddes' estimate, local losses range from approximately 20 million to 30 million yuan. The Japanese army advanced from Fuyang, through Zhuji, to Shaoxing. Before the Japanese troops entered the cities, these areas were bombed, with Zhuji suffering the most severe damage. It is claimed that only about one-tenth of the residential buildings remain habitable; the rest were either burned or bombed. The Japanese army was stationed there for only six days before advancing to Shaoxing. The damage there was relatively lighter, but public buildings and central areas within the city were also destroyed. Subsequently, due to the counterattack by Chinese troops, the Japanese army was forced to withdraw. Fortunately, foreign properties and church assets did not suffer losses.</p>
<p>Food Shortage</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Bishop Geddes, the cost of living in Zhejiang Province is exceptionally high. In the northern and eastern parts of the province, rice prices have increased fourfold to twelvefold compared to before. In some areas, it is even difficult to purchase daily necessities. Reduced harvests are certainly a cause of the famine. However, the failure of various towns and villages to adopt a cooperative attitude has prevented efficient food transportation from balancing surpluses and deficits, thus exacerbating the rice shortage. Ningbo has already implemented rationing, with allocations only amounting to one-third of the normal amount.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Travel</p>
<p>Coastal Zhejiang Province has suffered from blockades. Although a few ships are sailing, they are insufficient to meet demand. Bishop Geddes also experienced considerable hardship during his journey. He stated that he waited five days just to board a ship. Accommodation consisted of lodging in small Chinese inns and dining in small restaurants. After boarding the ship, he shared a cabin with nine passengers and six crew members. Meals were served twice a day, at 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM. After three days, they received biscuits and coffee once each. Later, he was detained in Wusong for five days for quarantine because Ningbo is currently a plague-infected area. There have been 94 reported cases of plague there, all resulting in death. The locations where the plague occurred were all cordoned off and then burned to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>

<h3>American Machinery and Tool Factory Robbed of a Huge Sum, Approximately 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The American-owned Remington Rand machinery and tool factory at 111 Avenue Haig employs four to five hundred workers and boasts a large scale and excellent products. Yesterday was payday for the factory. The factory specially dispatched two employees in a company car to the Netherlands Bank to withdraw over 60,000 yuan in cash, packed in two leather briefcases. At approximately 2:00 PM, as the car returned to the factory gate, suddenly eight bandits, four armed with guns, blocked the car, intimidating and threatening them. They forcibly seized one of the briefcases, containing approximately 30,000 yuan. The Russian security guard of the factory witnessed this and immediately drew his gun and fired two shots. The bandits also returned fire to resist arrest. As a result, one bandit was shot in the foot, but they managed to escape. The Russian security guard also suffered a gunshot wound to his left finger and was taken to the hospital for treatment. Afterward, the factory manager reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station, instructing detectives to rush to the scene to investigate and apprehend the bandits to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Ye Daoben Case: Kidnappers Executed</h3>

They were temporarily detained at the "Municipal Police Bureau" in the refugee area. Yesterday morning, they were requested for extradition by the French police for interrogation. Around noon, the Japanese side then took them away and executed all the kidnappers at Hongqiao Airport.</p>
<h3>Notorious Bandit Chen Xuewen, Repeatedly Committed Major Crimes, Sentenced to Fourteen Years of Penal Servitude</h3>
<p>Chen Xuewen, a bandit from Jiangbei, was recently arrested by the Central Police Station after being wanted for some time. The defendant confessed that on October 7th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], at 11:00 PM, he and his accomplices, armed with weapons, robbed two Western women, Mrs. Yi Shankeer, of 2,422 yuan in foreign currency at Lane 824, Yuyuan Road. Furthermore, on November 22nd of the same year, at 5:00 PM, they robbed the Lisheng Silk Firm at No. 10, Lane 400, Beijing Road of 14,069 yuan in cash. On March 2nd of last year, at approximately 1:00 AM, they and their accomplices, armed with weapons, broke into the Shanghai Electric Tramways Company factory on Hart Road, robbing it of 3,500 yuan in national currency. Additionally, on May 9th of last year, at 9:00 AM, they and several others who are still at large attempted to kidnap the wealthy real estate magnate Cheng Linsheng at Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, but were unsuccessful. The police station filed public prosecutions with the First Special Court based on the facts of the case. Judge Fu Lin concluded the trial, and yesterday morning, the Criminal Division of the court sentenced Chen Xuewen to ten years of penal servitude for repeatedly committing armed robbery at night with accomplices, four years of penal servitude for possessing Mauser firearms and ammunition for criminal use, and two years of penal servitude for receiving stolen goods. The sentences were to be served concurrently, totaling fourteen years of penal servitude.</p>
<h3>Tram Crashes into Car, Fortunately No One Injured</h3>
<p>Tram No. 10 of the French Concession, while traveling east along Avenue Joffre at the intersection of Rue Cardinal Foch at approximately 8:50 AM yesterday morning, when the traffic police officer was signaling with a green light, there were three cars proceeding one after another. Unexpectedly, the tram driver sped forward at full speed, causing the front of the tram to violently crash into the rear car with a loud bang. The car's engine block exploded, and the fenders and wheels were severely damaged. The rear ends of the two cars in front also suffered minor damage. Traffic was blocked for a time, and many passersby stopped to watch. Fortunately, the Rue Cardinal Foch police station was nearby. After the accident, it ordered several Chinese and Western detectives to exert themselves to maintain order at the scene. The damaged cars were then measured and photographed by the officers, and reports were submitted to the police chief for review and handling.</p>

<h3>Adulterous Couple's Tryst Ends in Extortion, One Suspect Arrested Afterward</h3>
<p>A Ningbo woman named Wang Acai, in the prime of her youth, was married to Gui Yuan, who resided in Ningbo. However, Wang Acai had an affair in Shanghai with a man named Shen Ruilin. A few days ago, Wang Acai and a fellow Ningbo woman named Rong Jie came to Shanghai from Yongshan. Rong Jie stayed elsewhere in the French Concession, while Wang Acai resided at 634 Niuzhuang Road. Wang Acai, having been separated from Shen Ruilin for a long time, eagerly sought to reunite with him. Therefore, the day before yesterday, she booked Room 557 at the Dongfang Restaurant and invited Shen to come for a clandestine meeting. As a result, at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, while Wang and Shen were sound asleep from exhaustion, Rong Jie unexpectedly led three men and four women into the room. The men claimed to be detectives from the French police and accused Wang and Shen of adultery, threatening to arrest them. Wang, being a married woman committing adultery, and Shen, committing adultery with a married woman, were naturally intimidated. The men seized the opportunity to demand money. As a result, they took 125 yuan in national currency and five pieces of clothing from Wang and Shen and then fled. Wang Acai, reflecting on the incident afterward, realized that the men were definitely not police officers and must have been impostors. She reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station. Following an investigation by Chinese Detective Song Wenqing, Xu Biaoqing was arrested at 15 Lane 188 Wangzhi Road. Wang identified him as one of the individuals present at the scene. He was detained and escorted to the First Special Court Criminal Division yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan explained the circumstances, stating that the mastermind behind the incident was the so-called Rong Jie and that the police are currently intensifying their efforts to apprehend her and bring her to justice. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned for further investigation. Wang Acai then testified that Xu was indeed present at the scene and had slapped her in the face. After questioning by the investigating judge, Xu was ordered to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Innocent Man Killed in Robbery, Police Provide Compensation</h3>
<p>The Yangzhen Ginseng Shop at 403 Avenue Edward VII was broken into by four armed robbers at 7:00 PM on November 30th of last year. At that time, Sun Boxiang (22 years old), a young employee of the shop from Ningbo, fearing that the police would arrive and arrest him, engaged in a gunfight with the robbers. Consequently, he fled and ran into the Yuanshun Porcelain Shop five doors down to the east. He was mistakenly shot by a Western police officer who thought he was one of the criminals. As a result, Sun Boxiang and Yan Zhongmin (28 years old), a Hubei worker at the Yuanshun Porcelain Shop, were unfortunately killed on the spot. Afterward, the Western police officer and the police department realized the mistake and apologized to the two shops. The Western police officer was also disciplined by the police department. The families of the deceased filed a complaint, demanding compensation for the damages. The police department expressed its acceptance and willingness to resolve the matter peacefully. These details have been reported in previous news articles. The police department provided a compensation payment for Sun Boxiang's family at that time. Since the deceased had not yet started a family and only had an elderly mother, they did not demand compensation or reparations. Wang Jiping, the manager of the Yangzhen Ginseng Shop, offered approximately 3,000 yuan from the shop's profits to provide for Sun's mother. He also took responsibility for Sun's funeral arrangements and the expenses of transporting the body back to Ningbo for burial. As for Yan Zhongmin's family, they demanded considerable compensation. It is now reported that the French Consulate has notified the police department to go and negotiate, and a satisfactory resolution has been reached.</p>
<h3>Armed Bandits Apprehended</h3>
<p>Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and Chinese Detective Kong Guangxiao of the Putuo Road Police Station apprehended four robbers, Sun Jianxian, Zhang Hongsheng, Lü Shoujiang, and Zhang Qiguo, at Lane Sanyou, Binlang Road at 5:00 PM the night before last. Two handguns and three bullets were seized. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Jiang ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziming, a robber arrested by the Hongkou Police Station at the beginning of last month, has been identified by the police as having conspired with others on August 18th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939] to break into No. 1954, Jing'an Temple Road, attempting to rob the owner, Li Maoting. The robbery was unsuccessful, and the suspects shot at Li Maoting but missed, then abandoned their guns and fled. Therefore, yesterday morning, he was formally charged with attempted murder. After questioning by Judge Jiang of the First Special Court, he was ordered to be remanded in custody pending further trial.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaoliuzi, a native of Jiangbei, was carrying an iron imitation pistol at 7:30 PM the night before last. He hired Fan Yiqing's rickshaw to go to Caojiadu to commit a robbery. While passing Avenue Edward VII and Hart Road, he happened to see several Western Third-Class Constables signing documents at the Chinese Police Station at No. 557. Zhang mistook them for a search team and quickly stuffed the pistol into the rickshaw puller's pocket, urging him to pull faster. The rickshaw puller agreed. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the vicinity of the Chinese and Western police, it suddenly stopped, and the rickshaw puller shouted, "Robber!" The Chinese and Western police rushed forward and arrested Zhang, taking him and the imitation pistol to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested a postponement. The court ordered Zhang to be remanded in custody pending a further hearing on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the "Spring and Autumn" column in yesterday's (15th) edition of your esteemed newspaper, the statement that "Three Movements" [public buses] will increase fares on the 26th of this month is actually a mistake for the tram company increasing fares on that day. Fearing that the public may misunderstand the true situation, we are writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Secretariat of the China General Omnibus Company Limited, January 15th, 30th year of the Republic [1941]</p>
<p>To the Esteemed *Shen Bao*,</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our client, Madam Kuang Liang. She informs us that her family resides at No. 56, Lane 54 (Ren Da Li), Hart Road in this city, and have done so for many years. Her late husband, Mr. Kuang Gongli, was returning home from a friend's house on the evening of the 12th of this month when he encountered a robbery alert at the entrance of the lane. A Chinese constable, No. 659, drew his gun to shoot at the robbers. Mr. Kuang immediately walked into the lane. Unexpectedly, the on-duty constables No. 247 and No. 2350, without asking any questions, drew their guns and fired at Mr. Kuang, hitting him three times in the head and chest, resulting in his tragic death. We are informed that Mr. Kuang studied in the United States in his early years, graduating from the University of California, and was known to be well-behaved and friendly. He rarely quarreled with others. His death in this incident was truly unjust. The reports in various newspapers on the 13th of this month were completely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we have been specially commissioned to write to your newspaper to request a correction, so that the truth may be known.</p>
<p>We have reviewed the report in your newspaper on the 13th of this month and confirmed that it does not match the facts and is clearly based on unreliable hearsay. We respectfully request that you make a correction to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Sheng Peidong, Republic of China, January 15th, 30th year [1941]</p>
<p>To the Esteemed News Editor of *Shen Bao*,</p>
<p>Having read the "Letters to the Editor" column in your esteemed newspaper, which contained a letter from Chen Xinji Knitting Factory requesting a correction to the facts of the fire at No. 66, Laobeimen Road, we noted that the letter stated, "The ground floor is sublet to Huafeng Factory as a warehouse, storing flammable materials such as wood flowers, which suddenly caught fire around 5:00 AM on the 12th." This seems to be placing the blame for the fire on our company's wood flowers, which is a distortion of the facts. The wood flowers stored by our company are still there today, snow-white in color, and show no signs of burning. Furthermore, if the fire had been caused by the burning of the wood flowers downstairs, why would the staircase not have been broken and the ceiling still white? The floorboards, however, are charred and beyond repair. Moreover, the front half of the space rented by our company is used as a warehouse and has no one living inside. How could it have spontaneously caught fire around 5:00 AM? Chen Xinji's letter seems to have ulterior motives. The news published in your newspaper last time was not inaccurate. We are writing to request that you still make a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Huafeng Enamel Company, January 15th</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Buying Surge Near Noon</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The gray market for Sterling and U.S. Dollars initially strengthened but then retreated to level. This was because speculators suddenly launched a buying spree after 10:30 AM. Within an hour and a half after the morning opening, Chinese merchants and banks unanimously sold off. Furthermore, American banks also started selling, and HSBC and Mercantile Bank supplied tens of thousands of pounds sterling. The trading price for U.S. Dollars for this month was consistently 5.53125 yuan. Subsequently, speculative demand increased, but sellers were nowhere to be found. U.S. Dollars for this month settled at 5.46875 yuan. At the noon close, the prices of both Sterling and U.S. Dollars were stable compared to the previous day's close: Sterling at 3 shillings 4.46875 pence and U.S. Dollars at 5.5 yuan.</p>

HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The equalization tax was lower by 0.25%. Afterward, American banks such as Chase also sold, and the market remained firm. There were reports of profits on U.S. Dollars for January at 5.53125 yuan. However, after 10:30 AM, a buying frenzy suddenly arose, with speculators buying heavily. Because sellers were extremely scarce at that time, supply could not meet demand, so prices tightened. It was reported that speculators settled U.S. Dollars for the following month down to 5.46875 yuan. This trend continued until the close, becoming even more active. Cash and the current month closed at 3 shillings 4.46875 pence for Sterling and 5.5 yuan for U.S. Dollars. Sterling for the following month was at 3 shillings 4.453125 pence and U.S. Dollars at 5.46875 yuan. The market was closed Wednesday afternoon, and the gains and losses of Sterling and U.S. Dollars compared to the previous day were indistinguishable.</p>

<h3>After Swap Trade, Buying Frenzy Suddenly Arrives; Gold Prices Surge After Falling; Gray Market Price Rose to 6,650 Yuan in the Afternoon; Cash Transaction Required a 120 Yuan Discount</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday experienced volatile fluctuations on the gray market, with prices initially falling but then suddenly and dramatically surging, breaking through the 6,500 yuan level and eventually soaring to the 6,600 yuan mark. Market sentiment shifted from fatigue to firmness, driven by large-scale buying from Daya, Tianyuan, and others. As the foreign exchange market transitioned from tight to soft, the securities firm Defu also started selling, driving the price down to 6,465 yuan at its lowest. However, prices rebounded later, soaring to a high of 6,615 yuan. Although exchange bill merchants attempted to sell to profit from the volatility, they could not stem the increasingly fierce upward momentum. Prices ultimately reversed course and rose by 84 yuan, to 6,600 yuan, which, based on the noon closing price of U.S. Dollars for February delivery, meant a premium of 211 yuan. Nearly ten thousand taels were traded in the first half of the day. The market was closed Wednesday afternoon, and gray market prices soared to 6,650 yuan. The swap trade for moving from January delivery to February delivery involved buyers paying a premium to sellers that rose from 140 yuan to 160 yuan. Cash transactions reportedly required a discount of 120 yuan compared to forward transactions, with buying interest but no transactions taking place. Jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan, to 660 yuan. Customs gold and other instruments remained stable.</p>
<p>Hot Red Increased by 84 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning opening, each bar (ten taels) opened 6 yuan lower at 6,510 yuan at 9:15 AM, then fell to 6,465 yuan. The securities firm Defu and bullion and exchange merchants sold off, with small speculators taking losses, causing the price to gradually fall by 50 yuan and enter the 6,500 yuan range, dropping to 6,465 yuan. Tianyuan and Daya increased their buying activity, causing a sudden turnaround. Gold and the major brokerages Decheng Securities and Tongkang came to buy. Furthermore, as the foreign exchange market stopped easing and returned to level, prices rose by 77 yuan, re-entering the 6,500 yuan range, reaching 6,542 yuan. Tianyuan then reappeared to sell, and Xinyuan also sold, retreating to 6,530 yuan. Daya then came to buy again, and Defu also repurchased. Xianghe covered short positions, and small investors rose up to aggressively push prices higher. The upward momentum suddenly intensified, and prices soared by 85 yuan, exceeding 6,600 yuan by noon, reaching 6,615 yuan. Finally, Xinfeng sold to take profits, and the market closed at 6,600 yuan, up 84 yuan compared to the previous day's late closing price. Prices rose to 6,595 yuan after the close and then quickly rose to 6,605 yuan. There was a 150 yuan fluctuation in the first half of the day. The market was closed in the afternoon. Reportedly, prices soared again to 6,650 yuan. The selling price of the standard-brand gold from the cash gold shops was 110 yuan lower than the forward transaction price. The purchase price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There were no changes in the current standard gold, and prices were sluggish.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at 10 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The asking price for jewelry gold from Ta Tung and New Ta Tung was initially listed at 650 yuan per tael. At noon, it rose by 10 yuan, reaching 660 yuan. The purchase price was 30 yuan lower, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Rise Considerably</h3>
<p>The foreign currency market yesterday saw gray market prices initially fall but then suddenly surge. Sterling and U.S. dollars ultimately rose by 2 yuan. Sterling bank notes remained stable and unchanged. Market prices remained level. U.S. dollar bank notes initially retreated to 17.97 yuan but then suddenly rose to 18.33 yuan in the afternoon, eventually reaching 18.25 yuan, up 0.22 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong bank notes was considerable, and market prices rose sharply. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were even, and market prices remained level. The evening price was 1.58 yuan. Demand for Korean bank notes remained strong, and the evening price continued to rise to 1.22 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Becomes Increasingly Heated; Yarn Prices Soar; Shuang Ma Reaches a High of 410 Yuan; Factories Continue to Offer 5,700 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be firm, and the upward momentum is becoming increasingly intense. This is due to the extraordinary activity of speculators. Market conditions are entirely based on standard gold prices. As for actual transactions, they are generally mediocre. However, Shuang Ma's steady rise has also stimulated market sentiment. Slight purchases are being made. However, factories are taking advantage of the opportunity to offer increasing volumes of yarn. The peak price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,425 yuan, and the low price was 1,391 yuan. Transactions began at 1,430 yuan in the afternoon and then at 1,427-28 yuan. Wing On offered 3,500 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn at prices ranging from 1,335 to 1,340 yuan, with a deposit of 200 yuan per bale for February-March delivery. Chongxin Factory offered 1,000 bales of 23-count Dafu yarn at a price of 1,340 yuan for March delivery. Shenxin No. 2 Factory offered 200 bales of 10-count Boy Scout yarn at a price of 950 yuan for March delivery, it was said.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Shuang Ma: Due to the initial rise and subsequent softening of market sentiment in the morning, market conditions were relatively level. Buying activity was sporadic and sluggish. The opening price was 1,404 yuan. With this price, Shengda and Jinzi helped sell off, causing the market to ease. Later, because the premium for Jinzi swaps was particularly high and market prices were still flat, prices reversed and declined, falling to 1,391 yuan. Prices fluctuated around 96-97 yuan for a long time. However, as gold prices improved slightly, the yarn market rose accordingly. Around 11:30 AM, rumors spread widely, and speculators became very active. The market rose directly to 1,423 yuan at the close. According to statistics, 6,540 bales were traded in the morning. The quantities purchased by each group are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade: 6,200 bales Hong Kong: 340 bales</p>
<p>Ningbo: 40 bales Total: 6,580 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Not as Active as Yarn</h3>
<p>Current cotton conditions are rising in line with the yarn market, but only some Chinese factories have a need for it. Foreign factories have no intention of buying because they directly order from overseas. Therefore, the cotton market is not as prosperous as the yarn market. However, cotton yarn transactions are more speculative in nature and can rise and fall.</p>
<p>In other news, the New York cotton market initially fell due to selling by foreign merchants, then rose slightly due to purchasing by some domestic firms. However, it ultimately fell again due to selling of New Orleans futures, resulting in a price decrease of 7-8 points compared to the previous day's closing price. In the Indian cotton market, trading has been very active recently due to purchases by Japanese factories. Yesterday, including forecasts, prices rose by more than 2 rupees.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai cotton market, because yarn prices are trending upward and the supply of Chinese cotton is scarce, the cotton market has become firm. Factories are taking advantage of the high prices to offer cotton yarn and also actively replenishing their raw cotton supplies. Therefore, trading among domestic firms has been very active recently. The total number of transactions is close to 1,000 bales. A positive outlook for the cotton market is within sight.</p>
<h3>Securities Stable Public Bonds · HSBC Bank Issues Dividends · Jardine Matheson Textile Stock Rises</h3>
<p>Public Bond Gray Market: Although many major players entered and exited the market yesterday, prices remained extremely stable. Trading was still lively, with buyers having the upper hand. While some short positions surfaced, major players also covered shorts and went long. Tong Kang appeared, but Shun Chang Hao suddenly bought a large quantity. Xin Fu sold in the morning but suddenly bought back in the afternoon, and No. 16 also bought back. Other firms like De Fu and Yi Zhong also bought a lot, while Tong Shun, Sheng Chang, Yong Kang also absorbed some. Ding Kang and Jiu Feng sold more. Xie Kang, Wu He, and Lian He all settled positions. Market prices remained firm. As a result, except for Category D bonds, which had very little trading and no price movement, the rest were slightly better by ten cents to fifteen cents. The trading volume was approximately 2.2 to 2.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Zhejiang Xingye Bank were traded at a price of 114.5 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The overall stock market trend was stable, and trading was very busy. Jardine Matheson Textile stocks were the most popular, with prices once rising to 48.5 yuan. China Merchants and Guangdong Real Estate shares also made considerable progress, with the latter once reaching a high of 15.8 yuan. However, due to many profit-taking transactions, the closing price fell back to 15.1 yuan. Rubber stocks were quiet.</p>
<p>HSBC Bank received a telegram from its head office yesterday stating that the final dividend for 1940 would remain at £2 10s per share, before deducting income tax. It also allocated HK$1 million for depreciation of business properties and rolled over HK$3,422,000 to the next fiscal year.</p>
<h3>Grain Foreign Rice Continuously Supplying Civilian Food Tens of Thousands of Bags Arrive at the Port Daily Yesterday's Rice Prices in the Market Showed a Mixed Picture</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, another 19,000 bags arrived in Shanghai. Taikoo's Hunan arrived from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon carrying 5,588 bags. Jardine Matheson's Ding Sheng also arrived from Hong Kong carrying 13,861 bags, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. That vessel also had 213 bags, scheduled to be shipped to Yantai on the same ship within the day.</p>
<p>After opening yesterday morning, foreign rice continued the previous day's upward trend, and the market appeared to be quite bullish. Rumors were rife in the market, and those holding goods took the opportunity to raise prices. The early market once shouted prices up nearly a yuan. Subsequently, with the possibility of waiving the Vietnamese defense fee of 2.5 Vietnamese currency units, people's hearts turned downward again. However, the exchange rate rebounded, setting higher prices. Foreign firms sent out telegrams for 3,000 tons that had not yet been confirmed. Therefore, with the surplus still arriving, the market price remained firm. As a result, both current rice prices rose by about half a yuan each. Original package buybacks opened for 700 tons, including Xiao Wen December 9th at 88 yuan, January 16th at 81.4 yuan, January at 82 yuan, February at 81.6 yuan. Currently, more than 7,000 bags have not been traded.</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning market, sporadic retail buyers also added purchases. At that time, the situation still felt chilly. For some of the lower-priced No. 2 Saigon and Xiao Jiao goods, prices had been raised by six or seven jiao, with the highest prices being 80 yuan for No. 2 Saigon and 72.2-72.3 yuan for Xiao Jiao. However, after this increase, foreign firms suddenly dumped a large batch of forward goods, and many holders of spot goods continued to sell at high prices. The market's sentiment turned weak at once, and sales in this street slackened. As a result, the upward market returned to softness, and the price declined gradually, stabilizing slightly near noon. In the end, the closing price was higher for Xiao Jiao and No. 2 Saigon because they were selling well, with Xiao Jiao at 72 yuan, then 71 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon at 79.8 yuan, then 77 yuan. Other higher-priced goods such as No. 1 Saigon and Huo Wen were selling slowly due to their high prices, and their prices were one yuan lower than the previous market. Overall, the rice market trend yesterday seemed to vary depending on the sales conditions and the cheapness of prices, so there were many differences, which can be called a situation of uneven rises and falls.</p>
<p>The arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin Japonica was rare yesterday, while retailers were quite brisk, resulting in uneven supply and demand. The selling price rose by one yuan, with Changbang Zhen Te Hu seeing white Japonica at 104-105 yuan and original packages at 108 yuan. Kunshan white Japonica was 102-97 yuan and original packages at 106 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice saw 97 yuan, 96.5 yuan, and original packages at 102 yuan, 101.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Retailers Slightly Greedy · Vermicelli Tightens by One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was still stable. Sales in this market were slightly invigorated due to the rice price fatigue, and retailers were more eager to buy. Those holding goods also believed that the new arrivals were temporarily lacking, and the inventory of foreign vermicelli in Shanghai was not too large. Moreover, with the end of the year approaching, most powerful holders of goods were thinking of waiting for better prices, so fewer people in the market were seeking to sell, and the situation had entered a brewing stage. Hot brands such as Clock Tower, Flower &amp; Bird Brand Australian flour were priced at 23.6 yuan, and Hong Kong's new arrival Blue Wheat Flower Brand was priced at 23.4 yuan, each being one or two jiao tighter than the previous day. A total of more than 5,000 bags were traded, all bought by retailers. Chinese factories supplied 4,000-odd bags of cheap flour, with prices at 21.5 yuan. With the end of the period approaching, all industries presented a year-end scene.</p>
<p>Wheat: Wheat trading yesterday was still rare. Chinese factories had already unloaded a ship of new arrival foreign wheat, totaling more than 4,000 tons, and were not eager to buy. Japanese factories only made sporadic purchases at the storefront, in very small amounts. Selling prices remained unchanged, and there was no buying or selling in the market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods · Dyeing Costs Will Increase · Gray Fabric Trading Suddenly Booms · Local Streets Rush to Send Out Dyeing</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market remained firm yesterday. Speculators who made profits sold some, but because the factory price rose, domestic and foreign stockpilers continued to buy, and selling was firm. Group fine cloth and twill were average, and some increased by one jiao to 2.5 jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth and gray cloth also continued to rise by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao per bolt. It is rumored that the cost of bleaching and dyeing will increase uniformly after the Lunar New Year, so wholesale shops in this street are rushing to send out dyeing early. Gray fabric trading has improved significantly. Wooden Street traded more than 800 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang-Fujian group bought slightly more than 200 pieces of blue cloth, bleached cloth, fine and coarse cloth. The Guangdong-Hong Kong group bought more than 100 pieces of colored twill and bleached cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Continued to rise and increase, and the market continued to rise. Longtou fine cloth futures peaked at 44.65 yuan, closing at 44.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge was 1.225 yuan three seven five.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market · Japanese Merchants Hoarding Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw tight foreign exchange, and Japanese merchants bought another 3,000-4,000 bags of B-mark white sugar and Dutch brown sugar, so the trend continued to tighten. The association's trading price for spot goods was 80.5 yuan to 80 yuan for 24 coarse white sugar in this warehouse, and 79.6 yuan to 80 yuan for sugar in other warehouses, an increase of eight jiao. The order date for February 10th was 80.3 yuan to 80.6 yuan, an increase of two jiao. Dutch cotton white BS mark was 78.5 yuan, and Dutch brown was 65.2 yuan to 65.4 yuan, unchanged.</p>

<h3>The Hoarders of Nature (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Miserliness</p>
<p>Another kind of insect that likes to hoard, and which we see most often, is the ant. This fellow's hoarding method is almost purely based on invasion and plunder. Think of the famous African termites, how many travelers have given accounts of their ferocity and dreadfulness! But the more a hoarder, the more miserly: the miserliness of ants can be proven by the very first fable in LaFontaine's collection of fables. The gist of the poem is this: the cicada in autumn asked the neighboring ant to borrow grain, but "the ant's nature is not generous, it is its small flaw. It asked the guest: 'Where were you in the summer? - Singing to guests morning and night, I suppose you weren't criticized?'" The ant said coldly: "You sang and I enjoyed it! Now please, dance gracefully!" - Suppose someone dares to ask a hoarding merchant for a little something, I think his shield of "don't even mention it" and his expression of rejecting people from a thousand miles away, compared to that of an ant, would probably be a thousand times more severe.</p>
<p>Short-sighted</p>
<p>In the fields of northern China, there is an animal that hoards food, commonly called the "blind tomb pig." It is more than a foot long and looks very much like a pig. The reason it is called "tomb pig" is because it digs tunnels and carries the soil outside, piling it up into a tomb. The reason it is called "blind" is because it only knows how to bury itself in hoarding, "although it has eyes, they are always closed," and so over time, its eyes have degenerated to complete blindness. It carries and hoards all night when the crops ripen in the autumn: it is said that someone dug up its nest and obtained as much as two or three dou of food! - Let this picture be a true likeness for hoarding merchants who are as short-sighted as beans and cannot see far ahead!</p>
<p>Relying on Height</p>
<p>Among animals, the creature that relies on height to hoard is this: its body is light, its wrists are flexible, it sits high in the trees to look around, so it can get information quickly and escape danger first! In addition, it has three burrows like a crafty hare, and it moves around constantly, so it is rare to fail. - The hoarding merchants' tricks are their unwritten secrets, forgive me, an outsider, for not elaborating.</p>
<p>Prickly</p>
<p>In Central and South America, countless big hoarders are breeding: these are the majestic forests of cacti (Cactus), the round-shaped ball of the Mammillaria, and the Cierne, which rises to a height of six zhang. To protect their hoard from being divided by other animals, all of these things are covered with hard thorns as sharp and strong as knives and swords. Suppose there is an ignorant person who dares to come and try to get a share: "Be careful! Watch out!" Who wouldn't feel pricked and retreat in the face of difficulty? - The hoarding merchants must have even more thorns on them, otherwise, how is it that the law, public opinion, and people with a belly full of anger, dare not shake them in the slightest?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The creatures of the world must cooperate and help each other to achieve common growth and common prosperity. Hoarding and speculating for profit, disregarding the lives of the masses, even if others all die, how can you live alone? According to the original state of the bees: after the honey is made, wild bears and wild boars come to visit, eating the honey and destroying the nest. According to the ants: there are anteaters tracking and searching, plowing through the courtyard and sweeping the caves! Which one can safely enjoy the items it hoards without any hidden worries - hoarders! Because of the bees' lesson, you should remember! "After brewing hundreds of flowers into honey, for whom do you toil and for whom is it sweet?" Because of the ants' teaching, I hope you wake up quickly from your dream, and from the result of the blind tomb pig, I hope you do not dig your own grave!</p>
<h3>It's Hard to Be a Woman</h3>
<p>— Nan Ren</p>
<p>Because I am a woman, and because I am always careless and clumsy in my actions, I run into trouble once or twice every year. Although society has evolved to be civilized enough, women still seem to be unlucky in this world.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, once, because I wasn't careful, I touched the old man next door's yellow pipe, and got two slaps from that old guy, and a scolding from my mother:</p>
<p>"You little devil, why did you break the old man's pipe? That thing hasn't been touched by a woman's hand in twenty years, the smoke dragon inside is just missing a head!"</p>
<p>But a child's heart doesn't understand so many things, I just pouted and didn't accept it, because I didn't break that pipe.</p>
<p>Another time, when I was a guest at my uncle's house, I was already sixteen or seventeen years old. Because I didn't want my shirt and pants to be washed pitch black by the maid, I washed them myself, and carelessly hung them on the pole that was specifically for drying my uncle's clothes.</p>
<p>After all, I was older, and I was a guest, I didn't get slapped, nor did I get scolded, I just saw my aunt's gray face, and the maid passed on some whispers behind people's backs:</p>
<p>"A girl this big doesn't know the rules, you can just hang your shirt and pants on the bamboo pole? It'll be good for her to eat at her mother-in-law's house in the future!"</p>
<p>I have encountered too many things like this, and often when I step over a peddler's carrying pole, or touch the carpenters' chisels or ink lines, my ears are filled with dirty words, and I can't even remember the repeated glares.</p>
<p>But I always just get over these things after being sad for a while. Facing those uneducated people, I can only look back one or two centuries. What can I blame them for?</p>
<p>But this time, I finally felt a little lost. Although it was still the same problem, I still feel a little embarrassed today.</p>
<p>The incident happened a week ago, on a sunny day. Because my mother was sick, I had to take a boat back to my hometown.</p>
<p>My heart was anxious. I bought something alone and got on the boat. Everywhere was crowded with people.</p>
<p>"Sit in first class! It's always cleaner there." Thinking in my heart, I hurried over there.</p>
<p>"Pig! Are you blind?" A hand grabbed my shoulder tightly. Turning around, it was a refined face.</p>
<p>"Look, what's this?"</p>
<p>Looking in the direction he was pointing, I found a hat box lying next to my feet. Based on my past experiences with trouble, I immediately understood what was going on.</p>
<p>"A new hat, bought for eight and a half yuan, and it's touched this bad luck!"</p>
<p>He roared like a lion. I felt helpless. If I slipped away, he was holding my shoulder tightly, so I had to stare at his face. It was a refined face, pale, wearing tortoiseshell glasses. That face could not belong to an uneducated person. I was at a loss.</p>
<p>"Be sensible, give me eight and a half yuan, who wants this unlucky thing!"</p>
<p>Even though it was winter, I was sweating all over. I only had a ten-yuan bill left in my pocket, and he actually wanted me to pay for this hat.</p>
<p>"Hey! What exactly are you planning to do?" That thing twisted my shoulder, and I almost cried out in pain.</p>
<p>"Give him the money, it's good to have a hat." Thinking this way, I immediately took out the only remaining banknote:</p>
<p>"Take it, give me back a yuan and a half, and give me the hat!"</p>
<p>Taking two torn bills and a hatbox from that thing's hand, I really wanted to cry. Was it really an unlucky thing?</p>
<p>Looking up, dozens of eyes were staring at me, and some people were whispering.</p>
<p>Opening the box, the hat was still so bright!</p>
<p>Two torn banknotes were just enough to buy a third-class ticket home.</p>
<p>"Is everything about women really unlucky?" Thinking about this question, I have had insomnia for several nights.</p>
<p>Droplets of Wisdom</p>
<p>— Chen Junmian</p>
<p>People who are new to society are often afraid when they see all the people around them wearing false faces, but before long, this person will also put on this false mask, causing fear to those who come later.</p>
<p>A poor person climbs from the bottom of the tower to the top of the tower of wealth, and he will often forget his former fellow sufferers at the bottom of the tower.</p>
<p>Smart people in the world can dispose of money at will, while fools are often dominated by money.</p>
<p>Rather than chanting slogans to save people, it is better to bury oneself in the work of saving oneself.</p>
<p>Roses have thorns, but their flowers are beautiful; bees also have thorns, but their honey is quite sweet. If there were no beautiful flowers and sweet honey as enticements, people would never know that they also hide sharp thorns. This principle can also be applied to people.</p>
<p>People often say that spring is lovely, but in fact, spring is like nitric acid, digesting people, far less than the perseverance of winter in tempering life.</p>
<p>Those who understand me will not scold me, and those who do not understand me, even if they scold me, I will not feel pain.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>He turned around triumphantly to speak to the few people who were following him, but at that moment, he suddenly caught sight of something dark flying toward him.</p>
<p>"Put your hand down! Do the people leading the troops like to eat people?" A very high voice suddenly roared from the right, less than ten or twenty steps away from him. There was a young man dressed in the same way, his face ashen, staring at him with his eyes wide open. Although he was just a student, he had a boldness that could not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Now everyone was alarmed, and Master Song immediately realized that he should not have overlooked this child. Liu Yuhua was an orphan left by his sister, and he had always known his character. There was almost no one in the world who could make him afraid, and he was the closest sworn brother to Yuqin; he really regretted not thinking of him just now, not cautioning him first, and now it had finally started, what could he do?</p>
<p>Since Master Yuan was promoted three years ago, he could be said to have been acting as he pleased. As long as he wanted to do something, no one in the world could stop him, and no one dared, unless that person didn't want to eat! What is law, what is human sentiment, in his view, were all jokes; he felt that he himself was the law, and his own will could determine everything. What governor, what president, were not on his mind! So Liu Yuhua's daring to publicly scold him almost made him suspect that he was having a nightmare, so that he lost his ability to deal with it, and actually took back his hand holding Yuqin's chin, and glanced at the black leather hat thrown at him by Yuhua in surprise.</p>
<p>But the owner of the Yuzhen troupe who came with him was already terrified.</p>
<p>"Lao... Song, this... child... could... could... be mentally ill...?"</p>
<p>"Who's mentally ill? You're the crazy one!" Wang Hua forgot all caution like a little tiger, pointing at the owner and saying: "Letting this kind of thing bully students, aren't you crazy!"</p>
<p>The owner was almost so angry that he fainted, and Song Shi was only left with dryly shouting "Presumptuous! Presumptuous!"</p>
<p>At this time, Master Yuan's power had finally recovered.</p>
<p>"Come on! Tie this kid up!" (10)</p>
<h3>The Struggle of Life (9)</h3>
<p>Facing the current adversity, have the determination to fight to the end, control all your energy, and fight the adversity fiercely, without fear of sacrifice, with a clear goal, consistent effort, and concentrated spirit. My struggle is great, urgent, and unavoidable. I will never let go until I reach the goal.</p>

<h3>Memorial Service for Shen Xiling Held Yesterday Fei Mu Believes the Film Industry Lost Its Most Excellent Director Friends Decide to Raise a Condolence Fund of 1,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Xiling passed away in Chongqing last December 17th due to intestinal hemorrhage. His friends in Shanghai held a symposium-style memorial service for him yesterday. Those who attended were all his friends and several classmates from Japan. There were no rituals, except for bowing to the portrait and observing three minutes of silence to express condolences. Then everyone took turns to share their feelings. Mr. Zhou Jianyun spoke first, believing that Mr. Shen was a model for artists and that those who came later should learn from him. Next, Mr. Fei Mu said, "Mr. Xiling and I did not have a very close personal relationship. Now, as an audience member of his works, I would like to share some thoughts. I think Xiling's style is similar to Sun Yu's, but closer to reality than Sun Yu's. It is also similar to Chu Sheng's, but Chu Sheng is sharp in his works, while Xiling is warm and kind. So I believe that Xiling's death is not an exaggeration, it can be said that the Chinese film industry has lost its most excellent director." Director Fei also pointed out several photos of Mr. Shen's screen works on the table to the audience. He said, "Many film photos cannot be taken out and looked at again after a few years, but we see that these photos not only still have appreciative value, but are also difficult to see now. In every minute detail, you can see that Xiling put in a lot of effort. This is an excellent artist in many ways!" Then many other people spoke. To sum up, they thought that Xiling's hard work, dedication, and sincerity in art were rare, so Xiling's death was a loss not only for his friends, but also for the Chinese art scene that was still budding - especially in the midst of war, Xiling was indispensable!</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided to raise a condolence fund of 1,500 yuan and remit it to Mr. Shen's widow, Ms. Xiong Hui. In addition to friends, contributions will also be accepted from outsiders who admire Mr. Shen. Donations from outsiders can be submitted to the editorial departments of the six newspaper supplements: Shen Bao (Entertainment), Zhong Mei (Art), Zhengyan (Prairie), Shenzhou (Shengao Miscellany), Da Wan (Silhouette), Da Mei (Night Light).</p>
<h3>Zhang Tai Liu</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>(10) Chivalrous Bones and Fragrant Soul</p>
<p>However, Huang Yuqi, holding a spirit of unyielding determination, was not discouraged by failure, and still wanted to plan the restoration of the country. He once wrote a poem that said: "Pitifully God □□□, self-sighing foolish people and stubborn stones, even if defying the heavens achieves something, reversing the day is not known." It is a pity that three characters are missing. Later, his father Qian raised troops simultaneously in the five counties of Chang County to restore the country. He gathered people to station troops in the Baitu area of Wujin, wanting to attack Changzhou. Shi Da, because of the previous decision to capsize at sea, failed to fight the Qing soldiers and establish a career, so he was even more eager to serve here. Huang Yuqi listened to his relative Xu Qu's words, thinking that Changzhou city was empty and had internal support, so it was not difficult to win it with a single drumbeat. The worry was that heavy Qing troops were stationed in Danyang, and the Qing general Ali Tai had always been known for his bravery. If he heard the news and came to help, he had to be prevented. So he ordered Youda to lead six hundred strong men to feign an attack on Danyang, so that they could not come to the rescue. Shi Da naturally obeyed the order and left. He rode a dark horse, holding a spear with a Zhang-8 snake spear, and led the volunteer soldiers, marching urgently at night, and arrived under the city at five drums. He knew that there were not many people and horses, fearing that he would be seen by the enemy, which would be detrimental to himself, so he planted banners all over the forest as suspicious soldiers. At dawn, he beat the war drums and shouted to attack the city, and the people inside and outside the city were all panicked. The Qing general Ali Tai suddenly did not know how many volunteer soldiers had come, and quickly divided half of the troops to guard the city, and led the other half of the troops out of the city to resist. Shi Da saw hundreds of officers and soldiers rushing out of the city, with banners waving, and the general at the front, with bright armor and strong horses, knowing it was Ali Tai. So he glared and shouted: "Tatars that can't be killed, today the righteous army of the Great Ming has arrived, you will die without a burial place!" He thrust the spear straight. Ali Tai also wielded the big knife in his hand and fought fiercely with Shi Da. Shi Da's righteous indignation filled his chest, and he had no fear of death, and a spear was as fast as wind and rain. Ali Tai was experienced in battles for a long time, and of course he was not weak. They fought fiercely for more than sixty rounds, without a winner. (36)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Training Class Completes Its Term; All Students Sign Three-Year Contracts with the League</h3>
<p>— Xing Gu</p>
<p>In order to discover talent, the League of Nations Company advertised publicly seven months ago to recruit talent. For a time, many young men and women applied, numbering in the hundreds. As a result, under the strict examination of the League of Nations, more than thirty new men and women were admitted and formed into the League of Nations Actors Training Class. Wan Cang, Yan Gongshang, Zhou Yibai, and others were appointed as professors to impart knowledge and skills in various aspects of film. The scheduled training period was six months. Later, the League of Nations authorities extended it by one month for the sake of achieving more satisfactory results for the students. Now, the training period is officially declared to be over.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter met with the students of the training class. According to them, after taking an examination, they have now all signed contracts with the League of Nations Company, with a term of three years, from January 1, 1941, to December 31, 1943. Regarding the salary, it is said that it is temporarily divided into two types, A and B, with type A being one hundred and twenty yuan, and type B being one hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Aphorisms on Self-Cultivation (30)</h3>
<p>Everyone has leisure time, and everyone wants to make use of this leisure time. Using it properly benefits both body and mind, while using it improperly harms both body and mind. Casual entertainment is originally meant to be occasional, but who knows that what starts as occasional can become habitual, and then one falls into a dark hell.</p>
