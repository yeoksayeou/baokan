<p>合衆社二十二日洛杉磯電　前駐華美國大使現往澳洲途中、就任駐澳洲美國公使之詹森氏昨晚表示、渠對中國之最後勝利、具有極大信心、渠稱、「中國一旦戰勝、美商必能繼續營業、彼等生活將可恢復原來狀態、」詹森係由舊金山搭「蒙脫利亞」號啓程、但該輪抵此以後、尚延未出發、因欲在未繼續其航行前、將更載其他船客至澳洲也、</p>
<p>合衆社二十二日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨日用堅强之字句、重申美國在太平洋之區域、反對一切以武力轉移領土之政策、此項批評之發表、係因所傳於紐約出版之報吿謂、日本地圖表明欲割據於匪列賓七十里內之小島、包括斯巴拉脫島、赫爾稱、渠對發行地圖或報吿之事實、尚不十分明瞭、但提醒詢問者謂、對以武力割據在太平洋或其他海洋之領土者、美國之一貫政策仍屬不變、國務卿又稱、渠對此事作特殊批評前、將更調査其詳細情形、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨夜在新聞記者招待會中聲稱、日本如正式續將太平洋中島嶼併入本國版圖、則美國將視為嚴重而不予以承認云、按東京新印之地圖、將中國海即南海之西沙羣島列入日本版圖、以表示日本原有兼併地之擴充、西沙帬島計有七島、日本於一九三九年佔據之、指為無主島嶼、實則法國於一九三三年已佔領之矣、當時因該帬島形勢險要、曾引起不少爭執、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日東京電　情報局發言人答新聞記者所發西沙帬島與其海南島、將否交還中國之問話、謂西沙帬島已併入臺灣、而海南島則為中國之一部云、</p>
<p>合衆社廿二日倫敦電　羅斯福總統與英首相邱吉爾、昨信已決定若日本對南進更取進一步行動、則必將遭遇英美之聯合武力抵抗、衆信此興趣即自然表明聯合ABCD（即美·英·中·荷印）陣綫、藉以阻止日本之行動、此興趣衆信係於羅邱最近之可紀念之海上會議中所議定者、當時曾重申民主國之決意以阻止日本之野心而引起將來太平洋之大戰、但戰略家之觀察、以為英美一致同意認日本之南進已至終點、英美雖有此項決定、但仍分頭與日本作外交談判、太平洋之火藥庫目前雖極鎭靜、惟此非表示危險局勢已减少之謂、在另一方面英美祗給與日本可能機會、望能放棄其侵略政策耳、關於此項消息之未證實報吿謂、美國已限定時期、於數星期後華盛頓以為將不必與日本再繼續談判、可靠方面稱、於最近數星期之非正式談判中、美國要求日本使越南及泰國中立、（此項提議、欲使泰越二國之地位與歐洲之瑞士國地位相同）日本之答覆作否認之遁辭、與遁辭之否定、此事傳係於日本佔領越南前所發生者、但日本旣已佔領矣、故美國之請求祗好置之於垃圾桶中耳、但出於衆人意料之外者、華盛頓與東京之談判竟仍在繼續中、日本且稱已提出欲與美國成立協定、限制在新加坡·荷印·澳洲及菲律濱之軍備、且要求美國同意减去對華之援助、以結束中日戰事日本之意、以為欲得美國之合作、其目前的至少須减去上述地點之加强軍備、華盛頓方面對日本之提議、指為「荒謬之滑稽」之幻想云、</p>
<h3>泰國安不忘危　決心抵抗侵略</h3>
<p>路透社廿二日盤谷電　盤谷無綫電昨夜勒令泰國人民安勿忘危　早作萬一事變之準備、謂時局現無變化、泰國未遇被人攻擊之危險、此時誠不宜發驚人言論、然民衆究宜準備防空壕避彈室燈火管制與防毒方法云、新任副外相法柴康昨夜以泰語播音、譯成英法德義日文轉播各處、略謂英日對泰之保證、泰國竭力嚴守中立之決心、與泰國寗願戰死以爭自由之準備、乃泰國安全之重要担保、泰國外交政策已於七月二十九日與八月九日詳言之、承英日雙方發言人如艾登樸芳等給予保證、泰人甚感謝之、茍有無故侵犯者、不論出自何方、泰人準備犧牲一切以應付之云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十二日羅馬電　義報紙昨日期以顯著地位、登載一項消息、謂英國現正密集大軍於泰國邊境、法西斯極端派之「伊爾鐵維爾報」云、現時中英美大軍集中於泰國邊境者不下十萬人、皆武裝齊備、又言、「據羅馬所接上海傳來之報吿稱、美國決意於六月二十五日撤退其在上海之海軍陸戰隊」、（編者按、關於駐滬美軍撤退之消息、美當局業已予以否認云）、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>燃料問題</h3>
<p>自戰後物價暴漲至今日，尤以煤之漲率爲最烈。蓋金價雖貴多至九倍；米價已貴，則爲十倍；惟煤色最黑，所漲亦最多，白煤小子等幾二十倍於戰前，煤球以其中非盡煤屑，然亦相近於二十倍之數，故今日燃料問題之嚴重，正不亞於米麵油豆，甚或過之。</p>
<p>一談燃料，在一般以爲俯拾皆是，宜無問題之可言，蓋薪材到處皆有也。而不知今日之上海，旣非五年前可比，亦非十五年前可擬，十五年之前，尙是杭柴溫炭之世界，白煤之運用，塊煤除冬令火爐，小子除少數酒飯店爐灶之外，絕少供家庭烹飪。白煤屑更無論已，正惟其去路狹，經營之者擱積巨，吃本重，而有煤球之製造，以廣其銷塲，去其過剩。不意一番推銷之力，爲其適合於一屋數家，烹庖無迥旋餘地，爐灶無安放塲所之小家庭之用：轉相推行，乃有今日家家戶戶，幾無有一家一戶不有煤球者矣。五年之前，柴炭猶可以供求相劑，故煤球雖盛行，用柴炭者亦參其半，今則淪陷區內，巨材則砍伐以爲防禦工程，道路橋樑；小則濫施斧斤，薪材而外，用以烤火。且搬運不易，動遭攔阻，橫施封鎖，杭柴溫炭，乃幾絕跡於市塲，有之，亦寖寖乎無薪不桂。於是家庭燃料，乃有大多數仰給於煤球，少數亦有用小子煤供爨事，頓使煤與煤球之地位愈形重要，不禁有多財善賈，唯我獨尊、而深其夜郞自大，居奇操縱之念矣。</p>
<p>貨物之供給分配、集中於少數人之手，易爲害。此孟子所謂有賤丈夫焉，必求壟斷而登之；以左右望，而罔市利，人皆以爲賤。蓋賤之者，惡其專利也；專於私利，則於公衆之福利有所不暇顧。今之煤，運銷出於一二洋行，煤屑之定購，又把持於一二廠家，故一經聯絡，左右市塲，易於反掌。夫小廠之不滿於大廠，由來已久，即大廠之欲鯨吞小廠，豈日匪遙，今之鼠雀所爭，安問曲直。特所不解者何以煤球又高至十七元二角一擔，或日早經揭示於報端，奚必問，問亦奚益，誠然，惟是否就存貨實際上所支出之成本，平均扯算，而定煤球目下應有之行盤。蓋每見今之工商界，匯價甫短，即已據此而重估提高其貨價；水脚報漲，而將存貨之水脚，照此揭算。故貨物往往未屆應漲之際已先漲，及至成本較高之貨到埠而再漲，一漲再漲，不問消費者能否負擔，不問層層剝削爲多行不義，而惟數千萬萬盈餘在握是圖，方以爲未足。絕不念此如山如阜烏黑有光之存貨，安知非爲數百萬用戶心血勞力之結晶品。是則何必問其成本之如何計算，即揭示成本，亦覺多此一舉；蓋漲則漲矣，孰得而變更之，孰得而根究其眞正之成本，以確定其應有之售價；若果照盈餘攤提以論存貨之成本，一噸之煤，不知能値得多少也。</p>
<p>在今日而言平物價，只有破除情面，不顧財勢，而後在公允合理之原則下，不祇顧公衆福利，以損工商業應有之利益；亦不偏聽工商業一面之詞，而欺罔民衆，爲之作烟慕。夫事亦甚難，蓋尊重工商業之營業自由，工商業乃得利用其自由，以對抗非常時期應有之拘束。如放任不之理，則民衆之呻吟咨嗟，是豈有地方之責者充耳可不聞。但欲處理生活必需品之合理的調節，端賴有縝密合理之方案，與夫堅靱不揍之毅力以執行之。然在目前果能使洋行所運銷之煤，煤球廠所製造之煤球，不出棧車，不爲囤戶所居積，亦不爲煤炭店所操縱，即行廠自身欲居奇，亦不能以備解棧單貨作爲口實，來相搪塞，而拒絕眞正消費者之需求。以滬上存貨之夥，一旦解除囤積之束縛，實行其現貨現賣，專應門莊，普及於大衆消費者，其價自平，其利甚溥，事亦輕而易舉。一面調查各行廠實際所存貨物之多寡，及其平均成本之大小，遇有新進之貨，亦加入扯算，從其成本高下，保持其應有利益，而裁制其過分誅求，訂定合理售價，以應消費者之使用，此則仍視能否痌　在抱而以民瘼爲念耳！</p>

<p>申請辦法卽可寄滬</p>
<p>關於進口商及進口貨物、須備具何種條件、始能獲得照新匯率供給外匯、昨據中國銀行某高級職員談、原則雖已到滬、但詳細書面之規定、迄未由香港寄到、故尚無所遵循、此為困難原因之一、蓋現時重心移於香港、交通不便、此種文件、決非如少數文字、可用電傳者、預料此項詳細辦法、不久即可到滬、過去困難當易解決、</p>
<p>辦理手續　約二星期</p>

<p>滙兌業務　發生困難</p>
<p>字林西報云、滬市銀行業務之紊亂狀態、今己達於極點、由市塲盛行之談話推想、可見在匯兌市塲新狀態之下、蒙受最大不利者、莫如進口商人、第一、由於貨船缺乏、郵遞緩之故、香港與上海間之距離、視昔更為遙隔、此乃不可否認之事實、例如有合法進口商與當地銀行簽訂合同、該銀行當將一日間所收到之申請書彙齊寄至香港、遇有船隻開行時、此信可於八天左右抵達香港、香港當局考慮此事、又須經歷八天、始能決定答覆、是進口商自申請以迄獲得答覆、至少須時三星期、此輩進口商大抵並不積儲大量存貨、通常以商品出售於當地華人商行、足見此種長時交易所冒之危險殊大、復次、經營新章程所未指定商品之進口商、不得不在黑市塲內覓取其外匯需要、但本埠銀行大都不願從事非法營業、因此昨日外匯需要激增、而供給則殊有限、黑市匯率分別降落二又四分之三及四又八分之五、但成交甚鮮、</p>

<h3>日方對上海美僑　不致實施覊留　旅日美僑仍可及時撤退　如阻美僑離滬不啻宣戰</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報編輯高爾德、八月二十二日華盛頓電云人、美國國務院官員相信旅日美僑所遇之困難、不久將吿消除、美僑未能離日之誤會、多因日方對日輪龍田丸在僑金中所受之待遇、頗感憤恨而起、</p>
<p>龍田丸事　法律觀點</p>
<p>緣美國人託龍田丸載貨者、於該輪抵舊金山後、提出訴訟、迫令該輪卸貨、而日方運貨者、則寗願將該批貨物、在未遭凍結之市塲出售、日方遂認美國務院何故不加干涉、而收回法院之卸貨命令、華盛頓方面因此會對民治國家法院之權力有所解釋、然東京對此、不予注意、顯有報復之氣槪、故柯立芝總統號若　泊日本、除旅客問題外、該輪本身或遭遇危險、</p>
<p>報復之說　不予置信</p>
<p>現美國務院不信日本扣留美僑作質、且以為日方不擬在上海採取平行之舉動、此乃處理對日局勢的國務院數官司員與記者晤談時所表示之相同意見、當局已委對遠申事務頗有經騐之亞契遜氏担任撤退旅日美僑之任務、據亞氏稱、渠未接日方不準美僑離境之報吿、但日方對外僑出入所加新條例、僅係八月十五日起實行、而華北日軍前亦施同樣條例、另外僑之申請出入者、恒延宕不決、人皆憤懣、然最後仍予准　云、</p>
<p>現狀僅屬　過渡階段</p>
<p>國務院官員相信現况僅係過渡階段、且蓋住數人、業已依法離日、故今之問題、厥在　運、而非恃强覊留、記者以上海美僑被覊留之可能性相叩、國務院官員謂、日方欲圍附一止美僑離滬、將利用海關實行之、但日方對上海未必實施封鎖、而阻美僑離境、良以此舉不啻可戰也、現國務院之政策、並無變更、凡非必要之美僑、自無留滯遠東之藉口、有重要職務之美僑、則不妨留居、</p>

<h3>偉大與平凡</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>青年們往往憧憬着偉大的事業，偉大的功績，想做萬人崇仰的英雄豪傑。然而很少人注意到眞正的偉大是從平凡的生活中日積月累而來的。</p>
<p>境遇的坎坷與困難，生活的平庸與單調，往往使青年們對於自己的前途發生了懷疑。有些人因此而心灰意懶了，有些人因此胆寒志喪了。他們雖然憧憬着要做偉大的人物，然而他們不知道偉大正是從平凡中生長出來的。</p>
<p>世界上並不是沒有一鳴驚人的事情，然而一鳴驚人往往也是從長時期的堅苦奮鬬中所收獲的後果，不是投機取巧所能達到的。</p>
<p>以「血，汗，淚」在為國努力的英國首相邱吉爾，其崛起並不是偶然的。四十年前，當他以二十四歲的青年在非洲參戰的時候，就已經表現了勇敢，鎭靜，百折不撓的態度：當九年前希特勒以無名小卒而獨攪大權的時候，他就已經馮着那付敏銳的限光，看出國社黨的抬頭，是歐洲的危機與英國的威脅。九年來他始終以一貫的態度高聲疾呼，希望引起國民的注意。邱吉爾的偉大並不是偶然二的。</p>
<p>一切偉大的人物，都是盡着一種克盡厥聯的精神，從平凡的日常生活中日積月累而來的。祇要我們在這平獻的生活中守住崗位，我們就有着偉大的精神了。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>勿失良機</h3>
<p>— 系之</p>
<p>在我的那本精緻的紀念冊中，第九頁上至今還留着這樣兩句話；「抓住時機，萬勿猶疑！」那是在我離校的前一天，一位奧籍敎授替我寫下的。記得他當下寫完這兩句話，署了名，註上年日之後，會拍拍我的肩膀說：「青年人，這裏面還有一個很慘酷的故事呢」下面就是他所講的那個故事：</p>
<p>當我還在維也納續書的時候，我們同班中有個十六歲的男生最叫入敬愛，他的儀表旣佳，天才卓絕，而又勤懇，溫文，而有大志。我們給他個綽號叫做「梅特湼」，因為我們深信他有這樣超人的智識，未來的事業是決不弱於這一位外交大家的。我們惟一不滿意的地方就是他的考究。他每次入學總身着新燙的業服，領帶也打得平整伏貼；遇陰雨時，他父親的車夫就駕了一輛簇新的車接送；然則他却是一個好人，毫不驕奪得，我們全很喜歡他</p>
<p>一天早上，「梅特湼」的座位二直地空着。此中理由我們在午飯時分就知道了。他的父親原是一個大金融機關的頭腦，昨天夜裹被執下獄了；此人所開的原來是一個大規模的詐財機關，被他連累的小商人不知凡幾。新聞紙用大號字登載這件欺詐的事，並且把記人的照片甚至於運他家屬的都登了出來。</p>
<p>至此我們知道了我們那不幸學友缺席的原因了。他羞愧了。報紙把他父親詐財的事連續登了半個月，在這半個月裏，他的座位就一直空着。</p>
<p>後來有一天，門開處，「梅特湼」溜了進來，走進他的座位，立刻翻開書，連上兩課，他的眼光都不曾從書上抬起過。</p>
<p>休息十分的鐘響起時，我們像往常一樣走進了走廊。「梅特湼」却一直向走廊盡處，一個人站着，背向着我們，凝視着窗外，似乎那街上有什磨引他注意的事物，其實我們知道，他是怕和我們的眼光相接觸啊。</p>
<p>我們體會到他當時破碎的心情，我們的私語與嘻笑沈寂下來了。顯然地，他在等待我們向他作友誼的表示。但我們不知道怎樣去和他接近，纔不至有傷他的自尊心，我們猶疑了，沒有一個人有道個男氣來開一個頭。</p>
<p>這樣一分鐘一分鐘地猶疑下去，鐘聲把我們叫進了課堂，「梅特湼」陡然地回轉身跨了進來，望也不望我們。緊閉的嘴脣更形慘白了。早課上完後，他忽忽地離開了課堂，誰也沒有和他交談的機會。</p>
<p>我們都覺有點罪過，都想求贖罪補過之道。但太遲了；他不再給我們機會了。次日早上，他二座位又復空了下來，我們打電話到他家裏去問，打聽出來的只是他在當天由校回家之後，突然向他母親宣佈他輟學的決心，並且立刻離開了維也納，到了一個小鎭去當了一名藥店的學徒。於是這樣一個卓越的天才，就因我們的猶疑不決而無聲無臭了。</p>
<p>青年人！僅只有了解，關切，友誼藏在心裏是不够的，我們還要有男氣，有想到就幹的勇氣，因為為善，助人的機會是稍縱即逝的啊！（稿費捐助學金）</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>然而他那裏知道像尙老二這樣一個陰險狠毒的鴉片烟鬼的用心呢？</p>
<p>「我說你毛包，眞最一些不錯的。尙老二吐出了一口濃烟，似笑非笑的瞅足着劉禿子說：「一這樣一件大事，咱們就能讓它輕輕地過去嗎？老實說，第一我就不服氣！怎見得她老子敎的戲準會比我尙老二好？就算他眞有幾分小頑意的話，他的女兒已經跟我磕過了頭，他也不能搶走我的徒弟：再說他們旣然不願跟我學戲，為什磨不爽爽快快的說，一定要挨過怎麼許多時候，說了許多謊，待我自己找上了門去，才肯說實話。這種地方，的確太欺人，我要是肯放過他們就决不姓尙！」</p>
<p>儘管尚老二說話的聲音還是非常的低，但其中所含的那一股陰毒之氣，却委實要比劉禿子的亂跳亂嚷可怕得多了。</p>
<p>「那末你打算怎麼樣呢？」現在劉禿子的腿是放下來了，神氣很平靜地，就在板牆上靠着</p>
<p>尙老二並不就回答，在屋子裏繼續轉了三四個圈子。</p>
<p>「現在我也並不打算怎磨樣。」他那一張黑灰色的臉龐上，突然透出了，　笑意來；可是這種笑，無論誰一看，都會覺得有一勺冷水巳澆到了自己的脊標上來。「反正這種事情性急也沒有用且過幾天等我那個外甥進城來報告了消息再說。隨便怎樣，我不相信她會逃出我的手掌去！」（一九二）</p>

<h3>盲人地圖</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>美國敎育界人士，因鑑於一部份視力薄弱之兒童，倘照常運用目力，大有終致盲目之危險，為保全其固有之目力起見，特設目力節約班，專收深度近視或將近盲目之學童，利用柔和適度之光綫，黑板上及敎科書中特大之文字以為敎育之工具。並令彼等學習盲人所用之文字及打字機，使彼等於不幸盲目之時，仍可繼續其敎青。此等兒童所用之地圖，與盲童所用之浮離地圖相同。舉凡山海川河，均可以手一棄即得，亦別開生面之敎育法也。圖示目力節約班兩學生研習美國地圖情形。</p>

<h3>狄斯耐第三部卡通　「幻想曲」的新作風</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>經過了兩年之久，華德狄斯耐的第三部長篇傑作「幻想曲一終於拍攝完成而在美國公映了。為了「幻想曲」，狄斯耐會費去不少心血，加以設計。據他目己所表示者，這一部畫片，和過往的不同。公映的時期，比較長久，也許將來他本人死去之後，「幻想曲」還在世界上面公映。主要的原因就在「幻想曲」是配有音樂的，而音樂這一種藝術，是具有，永久性的。</p>
<p>的確，在電影史上，影迷的　賞「幻想曲」者，還可算第一次看到全部配以古典音樂的影片呢！這部畫片之中，配以世界著名八大音樂指導所合作的偉大的音樂，弦樂，管弦樂，無所不有。所以影片在公映之時，充滿了音樂的氣息，因為狄斯耐早就想使「幻想曲」是這樣製作，所以意音樂特別豐富</p>
<p>音樂部分的演奏時間，有二小時之久，中間祇有十五分鐘休息。所以當影片公映時，也不再有新聞片作為前奏，甚至連藝術，攝影，技術顧問等台銜的冗長字幕，也一槪取消。的確，狄斯耐這次拍攝「幻想曲」，音樂部分所以有如此成功，為的是獲得好多大音樂家的幫助。</p>
<p>當狄斯耐拍「幻想曲」時，據接近他的朋友說，他對於製作畫片的藝術和事業，竟絕少說起，祇是說這部畫片，應如何製作，集中精神於指導方面。假如他日後決心想寫他的自傳，也許將請米老鼠，唐老鴨，和三小猪來說出他的故事了</p>
<p>然而有人和他談起「幻想曲」的時候，他就很高興的告訴人們，在他的生命史上，這是一次新的嘗試，而且更使他因而獲得許多經騐。他表示並非要破壞電影的傳說，但假如傳統老是沒有人破壞，那電影決不會有今日的進步，所以一般拘泥於傳統的人，無非是愚蠢者而已。</p>

<h3>United States Reiterates Unchanged Policy: Opposes Forcible Occupation of Territory; Unauthorized Incorporation of Pacific Islands into Japanese Territory; Secretary of State Hull Declares Will Never Recognize</h3>
<p>Final Victory Will Surely Belong to China: Johnson Makes Remarks En Route to Australia</p>
<p>United Press, Los Angeles, 22nd: Former US Ambassador to China, Johnson, currently en route to Australia to assume the post of US Minister to Australia, stated last night that he has great confidence in China's eventual victory. He said, "Once China triumphs, American businesses will be able to continue operating, and their lives will return to their original state." Johnson departed from San Francisco on the "Monterey," but the ship has not yet departed after arriving here, as it wishes to load more passengers to Australia before continuing its voyage.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of State Hull yesterday reiterated in strong terms the United States' policy of opposing any forcible transfer of territory in the Pacific region. This criticism was issued in response to a report published in New York stating that a Japanese map indicated the intention to seize small islands within 70 miles of the Philippines, including the Spratly Islands. Hull stated that he was not entirely clear about the fact of the map or report being issued but reminded those inquiring that the United States' consistent policy regarding the forcible seizure of territory in the Pacific or other oceans remains unchanged. The Secretary of State also stated that he would investigate the details further before making specific criticisms on this matter.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference last night that if Japan formally continues to incorporate islands in the Pacific into its territory, the United States will regard it as serious and will not recognize it. According to a newly printed map in Tokyo, the Paracel Islands in the China Sea, i.e., the South China Sea, are included in Japanese territory to indicate the expansion of Japan's original annexed territories. The Paracel Islands consist of seven islands, which Japan occupied in 1939, claiming them as ownerless islands. In fact, France had already occupied them in 1933. At that time, the strategic importance of the islands caused considerable controversy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: An Information Bureau spokesperson, in response to a reporter's question about whether the Paracel Islands and Hainan Island would be returned to China, said that the Paracel Islands have been incorporated into Taiwan, while Hainan Island is part of China.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 22nd: President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill have reportedly decided that if Japan takes further action in its southward advance, it will inevitably encounter the combined armed resistance of Britain and the United States. It is widely believed that this intention naturally indicates a united ABCD (i.e., America, Britain, China, and Dutch East Indies) front to prevent Japanese action. It is believed that this intention was discussed during the recent memorable maritime meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, during which the determination of the democracies to prevent Japan's ambitions from causing a future Pacific war was reiterated. However, strategists observe that Britain and the United States have unanimously agreed that Japan's southward advance has reached its end. Despite this decision, Britain and the United States are still conducting diplomatic negotiations with Japan separately. Although the powder keg of the Pacific is currently very calm, this does not mean that the dangerous situation has lessened. On the other hand, Britain and the United States are only giving Japan a possible opportunity to abandon its aggressive policies. Regarding this news, an unconfirmed report states that the United States has set a deadline, after which Washington believes it will not be necessary to continue negotiations with Japan. Reliable sources claim that in recent informal negotiations, the United States demanded that Japan neutralize Vietnam and Thailand (this proposal aims to give Thailand and Vietnam the same status as Switzerland in Europe). Japan's response was evasive and denied it. This matter reportedly occurred before Japan occupied Vietnam, but since Japan has already occupied it, the United States' request had to be discarded. However, unexpectedly, negotiations between Washington and Tokyo are still continuing, and Japan even claims to have proposed an agreement with the United States to limit armaments in Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and the Philippines, and to ask the United States to agree to reduce aid to China to end the Sino-Japanese War. Japan's intention is that to obtain US cooperation, it must at least reduce the increased armaments in the aforementioned locations. Washington has dismissed Japan's proposal as a "ridiculous farce."</p>
<h3>Thailand, Vigilant Even in Peace, Resolves to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 22nd: Bangkok Radio last night ordered the Thai people to be vigilant even in peace and to prepare for any eventuality, saying that the situation is currently unchanged and that Thailand is not in danger of being attacked, so it is not appropriate to make alarming remarks at this time. However, the public should still prepare air-raid shelters, bomb shelters, light control, and methods of protection against poison gas. The new Deputy Foreign Minister, Phra Chaiyosombat, broadcast in Thai last night, which was translated into English, French, German, Italian, and Japanese and rebroadcast everywhere, stating that the assurances of Britain and Japan to Thailand, Thailand's determination to strictly adhere to neutrality, and Thailand's willingness to fight to the death for freedom are important guarantees of Thailand's security. Thailand's foreign policy has been detailed on July 29th and August 9th, and the assurances given by spokespersons of both Britain and Japan, such as Eden and Pufang, are greatly appreciated by the Thai people. If there is an unprovoked aggressor, no matter where it comes from, the Thai people are prepared to sacrifice everything to deal with it.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 22nd: Italian newspapers prominently published a news item yesterday stating that Britain is currently concentrating a large army on the Thai border. The fascist extremist newspaper "Il Tevere" said that no fewer than 100,000 British, Chinese, and American troops are currently concentrated on the Thai border, all fully armed. It also said, "According to reports from Shanghai received in Rome, the United States has decided to withdraw its Marines stationed in Shanghai on June 25th." (Editor's note: US authorities have already denied the news about the withdrawal of US troops stationed in Shanghai.)</p>
<h3>US War Supplies Shipped to Vladivostok: Japan Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Information Bureau spokesperson Ishii, when meeting with news reporters today, said that legally, both the Soya Strait and the Sugaru Strait are international waters, but the issue of transporting war supplies through these two straits to the Soviet Union cannot be discussed solely from a legal point of view, as it also involves emotions. He recalled the case on January 21st last year when the Japanese mail ship "Asuma Maru" was stopped and searched by an American cruiser in the outer sea of Tokyo Bay, which caused a national emotional reaction in Japan. The current issue also involves emotions. If war supplies were transported to the Soviet Union via the Indian Ocean, the matter would be different. When asked if Japan would oppose it if the United States aided the Soviet Union with war supplies but did not transport them via routes close to Japan, Ishii declined to comment, only saying that the newspapers' expressed concern about American war supplies being shipped to Vladivostok sufficiently represents the views of most of the Japanese people. When asked if Japan had obtained guarantees that American bombers would not remain in Vladivostok, Ishii replied, "I don't know. I can't say anything about this now."</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Official spokesperson Ishii told foreign visitors this morning that Japan's opposition to American oil being transported to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok is mostly an emotional matter because it feels too close to Japan. However, he could not say whether Japan would also oppose such goods being transported to the Soviet Union via more distant locations. At the same time, although both the Tsuruga and Soga straits are legally international waters open to international traffic, using them for current purposes raises complex issues.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: "Hochi Shimbun," "Kokumin Shimbun," and "Miyako Shimbun" today all published editorials with similar wording discussing the issue of American oil being transported to Vladivostok and acknowledging that given Washington's concern for aiding Britain and the Soviet Union, such oil shipments are highly likely to increase in the future. The newspapers called on Japan to express a strong attitude regarding such Vladivostok shipments. The newspapers pointed out that although high-octane gasoline is embargoed to Japan, the Soviet Union can still obtain such supplies. The newspapers all said, "What's more, all the oil tankers are passing through our country's territorial waters to enter Vladivostok, making this matter even more concerning to Japan." The three newspapers believe that such shipments are creating a preliminary step in dragging the Soviet Union into the so-called "encirclement."</p>
<h3>British Naval Officer Arrives: Malayan Defenses Strengthened</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 22nd: Rear Admiral Spooner has arrived here to assume the post of Rear Admiral of the Navy in Malaya, succeeding Rear Admiral Millar, and is responsible for naval affairs in Singapore.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 22nd: Travelers arriving here from the Thai border said that Japan used to underestimate British forces in Malaya and Burma, but now the tone has changed greatly. On Wednesday, Tokyo Radio said that there are now 220,000 British troops stationed on the border from Singapore to Burma. Disregarding Bangkok and Singapore's explicit denials, Japan still claims that Thailand has received British requests to use bases.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 22nd: Officials announced that due to reduced production capacity, the Singapore-Bangkok train, which currently runs twice a week, will be changed to once a week starting September 2nd.</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Towards the United States: Initially Arrogant, Then Respectful; Japan Claims Traditional Hospitality, Denies Detaining American Nationals as Hostages</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: An official spokesperson, when meeting with reporters this morning, mentioned the issue of American nationals leaving Japan, which arose in the last conversation, saying that the claim that American nationals were being held in Japan as hostages is completely untrue and directly violates Japan's traditional hospitality.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: Japanese Information Bureau spokesperson Ishii said that the United States and Japan should begin "routine meetings" to resolve the various inconveniences felt by both sides due to the freeze order. These inconveniences mostly concern shipping matters. Ishii said, "Our traditional civilization would never stoop to detaining foreigners as hostages." The "President Coolidge" incident has ended, but the Japanese government has made arrangements for American officials and naval officers to travel to Shanghai on Japanese ships. According to a statement issued by Ishii earlier this week, the Japanese government had agreed to allow the "President Coolidge" to dock in Japan to transport 22 American officials, but when the American embassy attempted to negotiate for 100 American civilians hoping to leave Japan to also depart, the Japanese government cancelled the original arrangement.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: The Japanese shipping company, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, or yielding to pressure from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this morning allowed American officials to purchase tickets on August 26th to sail on the "Tatsuta Maru" from Kobe to Shanghai on August 8th. The group of American officials includes nine from the Navy Department, two from the Marine Corps, four from the Army, two consular secretaries, and nine consulate officials recently withdrawn from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Fighter Planes Shipped to the Soviet Union; US Issues General License to Supply Goods to China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: Exchange Telegraph correspondent in Washington reports that fighter planes have been shipped from the US to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 22nd: The State Department yesterday issued a general license to allow the export of chemicals, machinery, non-ferrous metals, iron, copper, and plant products such as rubber, wood, and paper to the Soviet Union and China (transported via the Burma Road, so that it can directly reach the free China area), Britain, Latin America, Dutch and French Indochina, Libya, and Turkey, Iran, etc.</p>
<h3>Japan Requisitions Merchant Ships: War Preparations Increasingly Urgent; Imperial Edict Issued for Immediate Implementation</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: Authoritative circles, commenting on news from New York that Japan is preparing to requisition all merchant ships for military purposes, pointed out that the cabinet approved measures to control shipping on August 19th. These measures, based on a future imperial edict, will take effect soon. Under this imperial edict, the government will be authorized to requisition ships and implement wartime transportation under the National Mobilization Law.</p>
<h3>Koki Hirota's Return to Post Uncertain; Sugimura Departs US to Return Home</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii was asked today whether Koki Hirota, the Japanese ambassador to Britain who recently returned to Tokyo, will return to his post in London, Ishii replied that he did not know. He also said that Sugimura, the diplomatic advisor to Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura, has already left San Francisco on a Japanese cargo ship to return to Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesperson Discusses Completion of Border Demarcation between Mongolia and Manchuria</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Information Bureau spokesperson Ishii, when meeting with news reporters today, said that after the 300-kilometer border line between Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia in the Nomonhan area was peacefully demarcated and officially announced on August 20th, the Manchuria-Soviet Commission is now discussing clarifying the ambiguous border lines. Whether this will be handled by the Border Demarcation Committee or whether a new committee will be appointed will depend on future circumstances. The success of the border demarcation relies entirely on mutual concessions and harmonious cooperation between the two sides. Plenipotentiary representatives of Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia are scheduled to meet in Harbin on August 22nd to exchange official documents.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Thai Envoys Promoted</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Semi-official sources say that the Japanese government has officially announced its recognition of the current Thai Minister to Japan, Thawan Thamrongnawasawat, as Thailand's first ambassador to Japan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fuel Problem</h3>
<p>Since the post-war surge in prices to this day, the price increase of coal has been the most severe. While the price of gold has increased greatly by up to nine times; the price of rice is already expensive, ten times more; only coal is the blackest in color, and the increase is also the most, with white coal *xiaozi* (small lumps) being almost twenty times more expensive than before the war. Coal balls, even though they are not entirely made of coal dust, are also close to twenty times the price. Therefore, the seriousness of the fuel problem today is no less than that of rice, flour, oil, and beans, or even more so.</p>
<p>Speaking of fuel, it is generally thought that it is readily available everywhere, so there should be no problem to speak of, as firewood is available everywhere. However, today's Shanghai is neither comparable to what it was five years ago, nor can it be compared to what it was fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, it was still a world of Hangzhou firewood and Wenzhou charcoal. The use of white coal, aside from stoves in winter and small lumps in a few restaurants, was rarely used for household cooking. The use of white coal dust was even more out of the question. It was precisely because its channels were narrow, and those who managed it accumulated huge stocks and ate up a lot of capital, that coal balls were manufactured to expand their sales market and get rid of the excess. Unexpectedly, the force of promotion made it suitable for small families with several households in one house, where there was no room to turn around in the kitchen, and there was no place to put the stove. It was promoted from house to house, and today almost every household has coal balls. Five years ago, firewood and charcoal could still supplement the supply and demand of each other. Therefore, although coal balls were popular, half of the people still used firewood and charcoal. Today, however, in the occupied areas, large timber is cut down for defensive projects, roads, and bridges; small timber is indiscriminately axed. Apart from firewood, it is used for heating. Moreover, transportation is difficult, often subject to obstruction, and blockades are imposed arbitrarily. Hangzhou firewood and Wenzhou charcoal have almost disappeared from the market. If they exist, they are increasingly expensive. As a result, most families rely on coal balls for fuel, and a few also use small lumps of coal for cooking, which makes the status of coal and coal balls increasingly important. The wealthy merchants cannot help but feel superior and deeply inflated with the idea of manipulating the market by hoarding.</p>
<p>The supply and distribution of goods concentrated in the hands of a few is prone to harm. This is what Mencius meant when he said, "There is a mean fellow, who will surely seek to monopolize and climb to a high place; looking around from left and right, he can see no profit in the market, and people all think him mean." This is because those who despise him hate his monopoly; when he is focused on private gain, he has no time to care about the welfare of the public. Today's coal, the transportation and sale of which is in the hands of one or two foreign firms, and the purchase of coal dust is controlled by one or two factories, so once they collude, they can easily control the market. The dissatisfaction of small factories with large factories has long existed, and is the desire of large factories to swallow up small factories far away? What is at stake now is what the mice and sparrows are fighting for; who cares about right and wrong? What is particularly incomprehensible is why coal balls are as high as 17.20 yuan per *dan* (a unit of weight). Some say that this has already been revealed in the newspapers; why ask? What is the point of asking? It is true. However, is the current market price of coal balls based on the actual cost of the existing stock, averaged and calculated? It is often seen that when the exchange rate falls slightly, the business community will immediately re-evaluate and raise the price of their goods accordingly; when the freight rate rises, they will include the freight rate of the existing stock in the calculation. Therefore, goods often rise in price before they should, and when goods with higher costs arrive at the port, they rise again and again, without asking whether consumers can afford it, without asking whether layer upon layer of exploitation is an immoral act, and only seeking to have tens of millions of dollars of surplus in hand, thinking that it is not enough. They never think that this mountain of black, shiny stock is the result of the hard work and effort of millions of users. In that case, there is no need to ask how the cost is calculated. Even revealing the cost is superfluous. After all, the price has already risen. Who can change it? Who can get to the bottom of the true cost to determine the appropriate selling price? If the cost of the existing stock is calculated based on the profit margin, how much a ton of coal would be worth is unknown.</p>
<p>When it comes to stabilizing prices today, only by breaking through personal connections, disregarding wealth and power, and then, under the principle of fairness and rationality, not only taking into account the welfare of the public and sacrificing the due interests of industry and commerce, but also not listening one-sidedly to the words of industry and commerce and deceiving the public by creating smoke and mirrors. The matter is very difficult. Respecting the freedom of operation of industry and commerce allows industry and commerce to use their freedom to resist the restrictions that should exist in extraordinary times. If they are left unattended, then the groans and sighs of the public, how can those in charge turn a deaf ear to them? However, to deal with the rational adjustment of daily necessities depends on having a meticulous and rational plan, and the tenacious and unrelenting perseverance to implement it. However, at present, if we can ensure that the coal transported and sold by foreign firms and the coal balls manufactured by coal ball factories do not leave the warehouse, are not hoarded by hoarders, and are not manipulated by coal stores, even if the factories themselves want to hoard, they cannot use the pretext of having no delivery orders to prevaricate and refuse the demands of genuine consumers. Given the large amount of stock in Shanghai, once the shackles of hoarding are lifted, and it is sold on a spot basis, exclusively to door-to-door retailers, and made available to the general public, the price will naturally be stable, and the benefits will be great. The matter is easy. At the same time, investigate the actual amount of goods stored by each firm and factory, as well as the average cost. When new goods arrive, they should also be included in the calculation. According to the cost, keep the due profits, and control the excessive demands, set reasonable prices to meet the needs of consumers. This still depends on whether one can feel the people's suffering and take the people's hardships to heart.</p>
<p>As for whether foreign exchange will be truly controlled in the future, that is, the source of coal, whether we will be able to obtain a normal supply of foreign exchange at that time, how can we be sure of this? However, in addition to coal, if the British, American, and Dutch East Indies provide a large amount of kerosene, it can also slightly reduce the consumption of coal and be used for part of the cooking, which may be able to slightly alleviate the panic that may be caused by fuel shortages. However, the situation is not so simple. Therefore, in today's world, if we can avoid exploiting each other and help each other to overcome this difficult situation, this is also the duty of the people. Why should we persecute each other so urgently?</p>
<h3>US President's Message to Congress: Determined Not to Compromise with Nazis; Eight Principles for Democratic Nations to Fight for Freedom; Once Endorsed by Congress, Can Become National Policy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a special message to Congress, reporting on his maritime meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill. The message was brief and was included in the Congressional Record. Attached was an official statement issued by the White House a week ago, containing the eight points of war and peace objectives agreed upon by the leaders of the two major democratic nations. The President stated in this message that the principles announced are very clear. If one loses self-respect by acknowledging a willingness to compromise and agrees to a world peace that would allow Nazism to rule many conquered countries, it would be difficult to oppose. Such a peace would only benefit Nazism, allowing it to catch its breath, reorganize, and launch the First World War to expand its rule in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The words of the Nazi government, whether spoken or written, are completely unreliable. This is known to all and hardly needs to be reminded. There is also no need to point out that this declaration naturally includes the world's need for freedom of belief and freedom of speech. A world society based on the principles in the declaration cannot exist without this freedom, and this freedom is an integral part of our struggle. White House staff said that the President's submission of the message to Congress was based on the suggestion of Democratic Congressional leaders during a brief discussion with the President on August 18th regarding the maritime meeting. The President's message mentioned Canadian warships, which is believed to be the first official announcement of the presence of Canadian warships at the site of the maritime meeting. The President's official notification to Congress of the maritime meeting was based on the precedent in the case of the American ship "Robin Moor," to inform the legislative body of the actions taken and the policies that have been decided. This message did not ask Congress to take any action, but Congress will certainly endorse this message. If so, the eight principles will become national policy and not just government policy. The talks at sea, the activities of British Cabinet Minister Beaverbrook here, and the meeting of British, American, and Soviet generals in Moscow all clearly indicate a new supply strategy with Washington as the central nerve center, opening up the production of British and American war goods, which are now being consolidated into a whole with one purpose and one goal. The result will be greater efficiency. It is rumored that Britain and the United States are now working to bring the Soviet Union into this supply system, so that the industrial efforts of the three major powers can be concentrated and directed in the best way towards a common goal. Currently, the Soviet Union has not provided sufficient information about the war or production, but it is believed that Britain and the United States have clearly explained this relationship to the Soviets, and it is hoped that when the trilateral talks begin, if necessary, Britain and the United States will speak to the Soviet Union again.</p>
<h3>The Only Way to Stop Mad Aggression Is to Use Force; The United States Is Threatened and Cannot Isolate Itself; Roosevelt Issues Warning to Isolationists</h3>
<p>United Press, Louisville, Kentucky, 22nd: President Roosevelt stated in a letter to the National Convention of Young Democrats here yesterday, "The only possible weapon to deal with force is force." President Roosevelt wrote, "On the other side of the ocean, above the ocean, and in the sky above the ocean, a struggle of force is taking place, the astonishing result of which is the unprecedented destruction and slaughter in modern history. This is inevitable. Aggressors create this kind of war, and defenders can only use destruction to deal with destruction, and slaughter to deal with slaughter." President Roosevelt's letter stated that "only the defeat of the treacherous nations' mad conquest" can place the United States "outside the scope of the war."</p>
<p>Reuters, Louisville, 22nd: President Roosevelt telegraphed the National Convention of the Young Democrats Club today, stating that the participation of Democratic committee members in Congress who hinder America's preparation process is a mistake. He hopes that domestic politics will not involve America's national defense measures. Unfortunately, there are still appeasers and compromisers in the United States and overseas. Regarding the steps needed to curb the Nazis, he will definitely tend to accept the judgments of naval and military experts and will not consider the concept that the United States can isolate itself in a world of turmoil.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Not Participate in the War: Sir Victor Sassoon's View</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 22nd: Sir Victor Sassoon arrived here yesterday and said that Japan does not have air supremacy, and its navy cannot fight. Therefore, if Japan joins the war, it will be suicidal. He believes that Japan will not participate in the war.</p>
<h3>Cantonese-Chinese Army Captures Strongholds, Recaptures Qingqi and Other Places</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing – A unit of the Japanese army from Sanshui launched a forced landing towards the Qingqi-Xia Legang area at dawn on the 19th, under the cover of machine guns and using motorboats and pontoons. The Chinese defending forces resisted fiercely along the river, and the Japanese were unable to withstand the resistance and retreated. At noon, reinforcements arrived and launched another bloody battle. Due to strategic considerations, the Chinese, after exacting a considerable price, shifted to defending the Hantang-Zhuzhou line, setting an ambush to lure the Japanese to occupy Qingqi. The Japanese then continued to advance into Hantang and Zhuzhou, whereupon the Chinese launched a major counter-offensive, and by 4 p.m., had completely recaptured all locations. According to military observers, the Japanese army has no intention or possibility of advancing west. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Northern Henan Charges into Northern Gate of County, Engages in Fierce Street Fighting with Japanese Army, Burns Down Two Japanese Warehouses</h3>

<h3>Two Thousand Miles of Soviet Border in Fierce Fighting, Soviet Troops Retreating in the Central Sector, Little Change in the Ukrainian Battle Situation Near Gomel</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd – Hitler's third offensive against the Soviet Union has now reached its peak, with major battles raging in key areas along the thousand-mile front. Soviet General Voroshilov is appealing to the people of Leningrad to help the army resist the enemy, while the German side has officially announced the capture of three cities on its way to invading the Soviet naval base of Leningrad, namely Novgorod (100 miles south of Leningrad), Narva (on the Estonian border west of Leningrad), and Kingisepp (15 miles east of Narva, 75 miles west of Leningrad). The Soviet side had previously acknowledged the fall of Kingisepp and now admits that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Gomel, an important railway hub halfway between Smolensk and Kiev. Operations in this area began two days ago. A German military headquarters communiqué stated that after several days of fierce fighting, German troops in the northern sector destroyed strong Soviet defenses on Lake Ilmen and Lake Peipus before occupying Novgorod and other cities. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, extremely fierce battles appear to be underway around the port of Odessa. The Soviet troops under General Budenny, who are defending the port, are holding firm in their trenches, resisting fierce attacks from land and air by German, Romanian and Hungarian forces. A German military headquarters communiqué last night stated that the German air force attacked retreating Soviet troops from Odessa and Ochakov (40 miles to the east), inflicting heavy casualties and sinking a 6,000-ton transport ship and damaging three large merchant ships in the Black Sea. The German communiqué also announced the capture of Kherson (100 miles east of Odessa) at the mouth of the Dnieper River. The Soviet Union recently reported that the waters and area were [secure], but news from Ukraine received in Moscow yesterday stated that a crack German infantry division had been destroyed after ten days of fighting, with three-quarters of its soldiers killed or wounded and the remainder surrendering. The third main battle area is the Gomel area, which is east of the Dnieper River. London believes that the German advance there may threaten Kharkov in an attempt to cut off the communications of Soviet troops defending the Dnieper line. The German side claims to have decisively defeated Soviet forces around Gomel and to the north, capturing 84,000 prisoners and 848 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 22nd – A recent communiqué issued by the Soviet Information Bureau announced that Soviet troops had withdrawn from Gomel (175 miles southwest of Smolensk) after fierce fighting. Yesterday, Soviet troops engaged the enemy along the entire front, with particularly fierce fighting in the Kingisepp, Novgorod, and Gomel sectors. According to incomplete figures, in air battles on August 20th, the Germans lost 21 aircraft, while the Soviets lost 11. In the afternoon of the 20th, five German reconnaissance aircraft that approached Moscow were shot down by Soviet fighter planes. Previous reports of three aircraft being shot down were inaccurate. Soviet spokesman Lozovsky, speaking to reporters here last night, was asked about German claims of capturing a battleship and other ships in the Black Sea port of Nikolaev. Lozovsky replied that this claim was false. The Nikolaev shipyard had one unfinished battleship and one cruiser, neither of which had been fitted with engines, and these had been destroyed by Soviet troops, along with the shipyard, before the retreat. Lozovsky also told a Reuters reporter that Odessa was neither like Dunkirk nor like Tobruk, and that the battle of Odessa was one of the fiercest and most memorable battles of the war.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd – On the previous night, Soviet aircraft raided Berlin, dropping a large number of incendiary and high-explosive bombs on military and industrial targets, causing large fires. All of our aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<h3>Red Army Commander Calls on People to Rise Up and Defend Leningrad</h3>
<p>TASS, Leningrad, 22nd – Voroshilov, Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army in the Northern Sector, Zhdanov, Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the [Communist] Party, and Popov, Chairman of the Leningrad City Executive Committee, made the following appeal to the working masses of Leningrad: “Citizens of Leningrad, dear comrades and friends, our city is now threatened by an attack by German fascist troops. The enemy is pressing towards Leningrad, intending to destroy our homes, seize our factories, kill our innocent residents, and enslave the free sons and daughters of our motherland. But this must not be allowed to happen. Leningrad is the birthplace of the labor revolution and the center of our country’s industry and culture. It has never fallen into enemy hands before, and it must never fall into enemy hands in the future. We live in a prosperous city, built factories and tall buildings with our own hands, and we will certainly not leave them for the enemy to use. Leningrad has repelled reckless enemies more than once, and this time the enemy's perfidious plan must be thwarted. The Red Army is bravely defending the city's approaches, and the naval and air forces are constantly attacking the enemy. Even so, the enemy has not yet been defeated, and their reserves have not been exhausted. Therefore, they have not given up their plan to capture Leningrad. Millions of Leningrad citizens are fighting bravely on the front lines, and the residents of Leningrad should become model soldiers of the Red Army, united with the Red Army and cultivating a spirit of fearless loyalty.” The appeal also called on the working masses of Leningrad to assist the Red Army with action, to organize new units of the People’s Volunteer Army, and to prepare to defend Leningrad with arms, including workers, staff, cultural figures, and all others. Voroshilov, Zhdanov, and Popov said to women and young people: “Women, quickly encourage your husbands, sons, and brothers to join the army. Young people, quickly join the ranks of the People’s Volunteer Army.” The appeal continued, “The Red Army’s demand of the people of Leningrad is to increase the output of military equipment. Those who work in factories should continuously supply the Red Army on the front lines with munitions and armaments. The people should also organize volunteer armies to armedly assist the Red Army. The German side is venting its anger by bombing peaceful cities and shooting women and children. The Hitlerite bandits are even preparing to use more despicable weapons, poison gas, but the enemy will eventually find out that our city’s anti-air raid and chemical warfare defenses are complete.” The appeal also stated, “We must be united and rise up to defend our city, honor, and freedom. The Leningrad City Soviet and the Communist Party City Committee are absolutely confident that the workers of Leningrad and all the working masses of the city will be loyal to the motherland and will not give the enemy a chance to advance. At the same time, we will further crush the arrogant and rude enemy. May the German fascist bandits perish! Victory will be ours!”</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd – According to recent reports, the large-scale German offensive against Leningrad does not appear to be making continued progress. War news from Moscow and Berlin still indicates that fighting is still taking place in Kingisepp, which is about 70 miles southwest of Leningrad. The situation in Ukraine remains unclear. A US spokesperson stated last night that fierce fighting is taking place some distance from Odessa.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 20th – Aftenposten's Berlin dispatch reports that according to sources in Berlin, German troops advancing via Gatchina were less than [illegible] kilometers from Leningrad on Tuesday night. The German army divided into one route to attack Leningrad, with the strongest force on the route advancing via Gatchina.</p>
<h3>Soviet Intelligence Bureau Chief Estimates Two Million German Deaths in Two Months</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 21st – Soviet Intelligence Bureau Chief Zovsky announced that, according to Soviet estimates, the German side has suffered approximately two million casualties, including deaths and injuries, in two months of fighting on the Eastern Front, with approximately half of them killed in action. Such heavy losses in two months are unprecedented in history. It is true that Hitler has incurred these losses to occupy some Soviet territory, but the occupied territory has no food supplies, only destroyed cities and villages, and bombed-out factories. Furthermore, the German army must cope with guerrilla warfare and the resentment of the people in the occupied territories. The three points that the German side initially propagated have been proven by the fighting of the past two months to be absurd. These three points are: (1) The Red Army is not a formidable enemy. (2) Soviet industry cannot withstand the strain of wartime. (3) The people of the Soviet Union welcome a government that is free from armed force. The fact is that the Red Army has fought with exceptional bravery, and the German side has had to eat its words after claiming to have destroyed the Soviet air force and tank corps. As for Soviet morale, a German newspaper had to say yesterday, "Over the past twenty-five years, Bolshevism has established the power to be accepted by the people without dissent. From this point of view, we can understand the reason for the strength of Soviet defense."</p>
<h3>Soviet Army's Steady Tactics Inflict Heavy Losses on Attacking German Army</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd – Military commentators say that the German side's claims yesterday of having occupied Narva, Novgorod, and Kherson, there is talk of fierce fighting. The west bank of the lower reaches of the Dnieper River has been ravaged by the German army, so the fall of Kherson was expected. The city is a major commercial port but has no defenses. The Soviet troops stationed in the port of Odessa are putting up a desperate fight, which is proving to be beneficial. The German army may be hoping for assistance from Romanian forces to capture the port, but this is unlikely to succeed. The situation in other parts of the Ukrainian front has not changed significantly, and the German army has not yet launched a major crossing of the Dnieper River. The German commander will have to take some time to gather sufficient troops and all the equipment needed to cross the river in order to launch an attack. The main focus of the attack now seems to be shifting northwards towards Leningrad. The German offensive here is currently in full swing, but it may not last as long as the previous two offensives. The Soviet army still has room to employ its steady tactics. The Soviet army has been effective in using these tactics, allowing it to withstand the German army's fierce attacks, inflict heavy losses, and avoid significant losses on its own side. The Soviet army is now close to fighting a battle to the death to defend the major industrial zone of Leningrad, but whether the German offensive will lose its momentum remains to be seen. In the central sector, the German army is also advancing in the Gomei region between Smolensk and Kiev, achieving local victories. However, it is not yet clear whether the German army in this sector will continue to advance eastwards towards Moscow or southwards to threaten the rear of Kiev. A large number of troops are involved in these bloody battles, so the German side cannot deploy its maximum forces to attack simultaneously along the entire front, but the German side attaches great importance to the central sector, without a doubt. This is because the central sector is directly opposite Moscow. The German army has repeatedly attempted to break through the Soviet lines without success, and it may now make another attempt to break through the lines in the central sector and attack with all its might.</p>
<h3>Wavell's Troops Reportedly Entered Iran, This is to Prevent German Invasion of India</h3>
<p>Havas, Saint-Lin, 22nd – The German News Agency recently issued a Boston dispatch stating that, according to reliable sources, the troops of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, have entered Iran.</p>
<p>Havas, Bulgarian Capital, 22nd – According to Bulgarian sources, after British troops invaded neutral Iran and entered its territory, they will be able to make contact with Soviet troops, but this move can only prevent a German invasion of India and cannot save the collapse of the Soviet Union. The attitude of Turkey is now attracting attention.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd – A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Berlin has not yet received official reports regarding Britain's recent actions in Iran, and therefore cannot express an opinion at this time.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Sweden, 22nd – A local newspaper reported a report from a London correspondent stating that Britain and the Soviet Union requested the Iranian government to dismiss German technical personnel and hire British engineers to replace them. If difficulties arise as a result, Britain will resolve them. The British government does not object to the Iranian government hiring Turkish engineers. It also stated that if the Iranian government cannot absolutely guarantee that no accidents will occur, Britain and the Soviet Union will take necessary steps. It is not yet clear whether Britain and the Soviet Union intend to occupy Iranian territory, and it is difficult to speculate.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Advocates Declaring War on Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 22nd – The American "New Republic Weekly" argues that the President should propose declaring war on the Axis powers, and Congress should support it, saying that a joint attack by the US, Soviet Union, and Britain at this time would have the opportunity to immediately and completely defeat Hitler. The United States would be more certain of defeating Germany by joining the Allies in fighting Germany than by fighting Germany alone in the future. If today's war is not related to us, then we should not be involved. But we have now decided to be involved. Since today's war is related to us, we should treat it as our own war and do our best to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Rumors of German Troop Movements in Bulgaria, Possibly Seeking Transit Through Turkey, Italian Troops Echoing Simultaneously, Turkey Refuses Request, Troops Will Attack Turkey</h3>
<p>United Press International, Turkish Capital, 22nd – A report received here yesterday stated that many German reinforcements and air forces are currently moving towards Bulgaria, while Italy is also carrying out large-scale movements in Thrace and the Aegean Islands. All of these indicate that Germany may request transit through Turkey. If Turkey refuses, Germany will attack Turkey. Other developments that support this belief are as follows: (1) The German war against the Soviet Union will extend into the winter, and there is no hope of a decisive victory in the short term. (2) Events may occur in Iran soon. (3) Turkish-German diplomacy is very active. Diplomats from the Balkans believe that if Turkey participates in the war against Germany, it will deal a fatal blow to Germany's plans in the Balkans, because the Slavic peoples and troubled areas in the region will at that time face serious difficulties due to the increased sympathy of the Bulgarian government for the Soviet Union and the Slavic peoples. Although Romania is fighting against the Soviet Union, this is not what the people want. According to neutral observers, 90% of Romanians oppose the war against the Soviet Union and hope to withdraw from the war if they have the opportunity. It is also said that Yuan Mengniu, the leader of the most powerful political party in Romania, has completed the reorganization of all his troops. As for the recent letter to Prime Minister Antonescu warning him not to drive Romanian troops across the eastern front of Bessarabia to fight against the Soviet Union, he said that the world knows that the final victory will not belong to Germany, but to the United States. It is believed that Mengniu will appeal to the democratic country for assistance to seize power in Romania as soon as he has the opportunity. [Illegible] who recently arrived here, when discussing Hitler's invasion of Turkey to realize his original plan to attack India, said that 200,000 German troops have been concentrated on the Turkish border, and trains transporting soldiers, military supplies, and artillery are constantly arriving with other reinforcements.</p>

<h3>280 Japanese Families Evacuated from the Philippines Arrive in Shanghai, Their Ancestral Home</h3>
<p>Thorough Searches Conducted by Philippine Port Authorities; Local Defenses Have Reached a Solid State</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," 280 Japanese, 8 German, and 2 Italian evacuees from the Philippines, after undergoing strict searches by port authorities in Manila, embarked on the French Postal Steamship Company's "Chafei" and arrived in Shanghai this morning (22nd), mooring at buoys 12 and 13. The Japanese passengers disembarked at the Japanese Mail Shipping Company's Bund wharf, while other passengers, including the families of 10 French nationals from Saigon, landed at the Customs wharf at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Feel It Is Impossible to Continue</p>
<p>Among the Japanese who arrived in Shanghai on the "Chafei" was Mr. Imamura, who operated a lumber business in Manila. He stated that in recent months, Japanese businesses in the Philippines have been unable to operate, making it absolutely necessary for Japanese to leave the country. Furthermore, the cost of living in the Philippines is extremely high, making it impossible for most Japanese to sustain themselves, especially with the recent issuance of the U.S. freezing order. Therefore, the evacuation of Japanese is a logical course of action, he said. Mr. Xu Erfus, a German employee of an American grain company in Manila, also arrived in Shanghai on the "Chafei." Mr. Xu declined to comment on the situation in the Philippines, only stating that besides German missionaries, there are still a large number of Germans in Manila.</p>
<p>Subjected to Strict Inspection Before Leaving the Philippines</p>
<p>Another passenger recounted the Manila port authorities' search of the "Chafei," stating that almost every passenger on board was subjected to inspection. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Manila in the morning, but departure was delayed until noon. During this delay, most of the passengers, mainly Japanese, underwent thorough searches. Bedding and luggage were all examined in detail. It was said that several Japanese attempted to carry US$50,000 back to Japan, but were discovered and confiscated by port authorities. Even American passengers were subjected to strict scrutiny, with several being questioned by port officials and ordered to wait in the ship's lounge from 8:00 AM until departure.</p>
<p>Sense of the Situation Has Changed</p>
<p>Mr. Goerting, the general manager of the Shanghai branch of the American shipping company Reifeng, traveled to Hong Kong and Manila on business about six weeks ago, taking the opportunity to travel. He stayed in Manila for over two weeks and returned to Shanghai this morning (22nd). He said that while most residents of Manila are uncertain about future developments, their view of the situation in the Far East has gradually shifted from pessimistic to optimistic. Defense measures in the Philippine capital are being expedited. The main concern is the possibility of aerial bombardment in the event of war, but air defense preparations are believed to be complete, and plans have been made to evacuate women and children to the countryside if war breaks out.</p>

<h3>Reportedly Reduced War Risk Insurance in the Pacific Region</h3>
<p>Near the close of trading the day before yesterday, there was a sudden rumor that war risk insurance rates in the Pacific region had been reduced, but insurance companies in this city denied this, only stating that the war risk insurance rates in Shanghai had been adjusted according to the rates set in Hong Kong. It is understood that the war risk insurance rate for goods loaded on ships from Shanghai to the United States has been reduced from 1.5% to 0.5%, and the war risk insurance rate for goods loaded on ships from the United States to Shanghai has been reduced from 1.75% to 0.75%. However, this news had a slightly positive impact, and the market closed in a relatively stable state.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill to Broadcast Next Monday Regarding His Meeting with Roosevelt</h3>

<p>Go-Slow by Letterpress Workers</p>
<p>The Letterpress Printers Association of the Letterpress Industry stated that there are more than 50 printing houses in this city engaged in letterpress printing, employing approximately 1,000 workers. Wages have always been extremely low. Since the sharp rise in prices, workers have found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. In the spirit of labor-management cooperation, they had an open discussion at the end of last year to seek a fair adjustment to wages, resulting in a 10% reduction. By early May, as prices continued to rise sharply, they requested a 20% wage increase (agreed upon by both labor and management and announced in the Xin Shen Pao on May 5). However, some operators did not comply with the standard price, making it difficult for management to implement externally, and the agreement was overturned. Workers were unable to resist and have endured this for over three months. As prices have recently skyrocketed uncontrollably, making it impossible for workers to make a living, they sent a letter on July 25th requesting the trade association to restore the previously agreed-upon wage scale and add another 10%. Thanks to the efforts of the trade association, an agreement was reached, and more than 30 employers signed to comply. However, the agreement could only be implemented if all employers complied. For days, both labor and management have been urging the few employers who have not signed to comply, but several have ignored them, hindering the implementation of the entire agreement and preventing the promised wage increases from being realized. Workers are understandably uneasy, and the labor unrest that has been brewing for days finally erupted yesterday in a go-slow.</p>
<h3>To Benefit Unemployed and Out-of-School Young People in Commerce and Industry, Two Schools Respond Enthusiastically; Special Free Commercial Knowledge Classes Established; Store Clerks and Apprentices May Apply for Admission</h3>
<p>Application Forms for the Shen Pao Readers Scholarship are Being Printed</p>
<p>The Shen Pao Readers Scholarship is sponsoring vocational training for commercial and industrial employees, hoping to provide opportunities for further education for store clerks who have dropped out of school. Yesterday, many letters were received from all sectors requesting application forms, which will be distributed as soon as they are printed. In addition, some have written to offer suggestions, for which we are extremely grateful. Yesterday, the Shanghai Second Vocational Supplementary School at No. 301 White Crane Road also sent a letter supporting this newspaper's sponsorship of vocational training for commercial and industrial employees, offering a special free quota, which is good news for the store clerk education movement. We will publish the two letters separately as follows:</p>
<p>Meng Xian Business School Establishes a Free Quota</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Mingxian, the principal of the private Xian High-Level Business and Cultural School, wrote yesterday: "Dear Sirs, we are deeply impressed and admire the kind intentions of your newspaper's student aid program. However, we believe that young vocational people who aspire to study, regardless of who they are, are unable to study during the day due to the demands of life, and are hindered from vocational training by economic constraints, leaving them without access to education. In light of this situation, our school has made a small effort to establish a quota of 20 impoverished students, 10 for the advanced level and 10 for the elementary level, completely free of charge. All books and stationery will be provided by our school as support. Any young vocational person who is willing to take vocational training in Chinese, English, and mathematics, and who is verified by your office as impoverished, can be recommended for admission. We are writing to inform you of this and hope that you will disclose this information so that students can apply. We will be extremely grateful." The staff of this newspaper believes that Chinese, English, and mathematics are the main subjects that commercial and industrial employees urgently need to supplement. This school's action is a great and significant benefit to vocational youth and is worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Second Vocational School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Vocational Supplementary School wrote: "Dear Sirs, we are deeply impressed and admire the good and charitable intentions of your newspaper's Readers Scholarship, which benefits out-of-school children and contributes to society and the nation. Our school has always been committed to helping out-of-school young people, and we are now donating five free places to express our support. The procedure is that those who have been reviewed and certified by your newspaper can be admitted free of charge, and they can choose any subject and class time." We are extremely respectful of their enthusiasm for helping students.</p>
<p>University and Middle School Students to Receive Funds Tomorrow</p>
<p>The list of students approved for the scholarship from universities and middle schools has been successively announced. In addition, the four schools of the newly established Second Department, Yu Cai Middle School, Zhengzhong Girls' Middle School, and Jingzhi Girls' Middle School, have a special free quota for the Shen Pao Readers Scholarship, and many impoverished students have applied for admission. It is now decided to publish the list of approved admissions on the 24th. The scholarships for students from universities and middle schools will be distributed starting at 9:30 AM on the 24th. We hope that all approved students will bring their seals to the office to collect their funds in person at that time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Will Not Detain American Nationals in Shanghai; American Nationals in Japan Can Still Evacuate in Time; Blocking American Nationals from Leaving Shanghai Would Be Tantamount to a Declaration of War</h3>
<p>Gold, editor of the English-language "China Press," wired from Washington on August 22nd, stating that officials at the U.S. State Department believe that the difficulties encountered by American nationals in Japan will soon be eliminated. The misunderstanding that American nationals were unable to leave Japan was largely due to the Japanese side's resentment over the treatment of the Japanese ship "Tatsuta Maru" in San Francisco.</p>
<p>"Tatsuta Maru" Incident from a Legal Perspective</p>
<p>American shippers who entrusted goods to the "Tatsuta Maru" filed a lawsuit after the ship arrived in San Francisco, forcing the ship to unload. The Japanese shippers preferred to sell the goods in a market that had not been frozen. The Japanese side wondered why the U.S. State Department did not intervene and reverse the court's order to unload. Washington therefore explained the power of the courts in a democratic country, but Tokyo paid no attention to this and clearly had a retaliatory attitude. Therefore, the "President Coolidge" may encounter danger if it docks in Japan, aside from the passenger issue.</p>
<p>Retaliation Theory Not Believed</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department does not believe that Japan is holding American nationals as hostages and does not intend to take parallel action in Shanghai. This is the common opinion expressed by several officials at the State Department who are handling the situation with Japan in discussions with reporters. The authorities have assigned Mr. Acheson, who has considerable experience in Far Eastern affairs, to be responsible for the evacuation of American nationals in Japan. According to Mr. Acheson, he has not received reports that the Japanese side is not allowing American nationals to leave the country. However, new regulations imposed by the Japanese side on the entry and exit of foreigners only took effect on August 15th, and the Japanese army in North China had previously implemented similar regulations. Applications from foreigners for entry and exit have been constantly delayed, causing widespread resentment, but they have ultimately been approved.</p>
<p>The Current Situation is Only a Transitional Phase</p>
<p>State Department officials believe that the current situation is only a transitional phase, and that several people have already left Japan legally. Therefore, the current problem lies in transport, not in forced detention. When reporters asked about the possibility of American nationals in Shanghai being detained, State Department officials said that the Japanese side might try to block American nationals from leaving Shanghai by using the customs, but the Japanese side is unlikely to impose a blockade on Shanghai to prevent American nationals from leaving the country, as this would be tantamount to war. The current policy of the State Department has not changed: non-essential American nationals have no excuse to remain in the Far East, while American nationals with important jobs may remain.</p>

<h3>U.S. Consul General Denies Holding Meeting; Says He Never Met British Consul Yesterday; May Have Been a Mistake for a Visit to the New Commercial Counselor</h3>
<p>There have been reports that the Allied Consular Corps held an important meeting at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai on Thursday (the 21st) morning, and that the U.S. and British Consuls General exchanged views for two hours. However, according to U.S. Consul General Locke Hart to reporters, this is not the case. Locke also said that he never met the British Consul General that day. Perhaps the British Consul General came to visit the new Commercial Counselor Groves, but he cannot be sure. According to the reporter's understanding, the rumored withdrawal of the U.S. Navy's Fourth Fleet from Shanghai is also completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Famous Doctor Wang Boyuan Kidnapped Yesterday</h3>
<p>Western-trained doctor Wang Boyuan, founder of the Chinese Hospital (with its affiliated Hongkou Public Maternity Hospital), whose main branch is located at the intersection of Huade Road and Tilanqiao in Hongkou, and whose branch is located at No. 251 Pike Road on New Zhabei Road, was kidnapped yesterday morning at 9:45 AM. As usual, Dr. Wang was riding in his private car to the Hongkou Weaving Hospital to work, when he passed the intersection of East-West Huade Road and Gongping Road, suddenly encountering three kidnappers who blocked the way. They all drew weapons and threatened Wang and the driver not to make a sound. Two of the kidnappers approached the car and dragged Wang out of the car, forcing him into a car parked by the side of Gongping Road by the kidnappers. Seeing the weapons, Wang dared not resist and had to get into the car. The three kidnappers then got into the car and drove away at full speed, heading east and disappearing. Afterwards, the driver reported the incident to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate.</p>

<h3>Monks in Yishou Temple Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Arrested and Awaiting Sentence Together</p>
<p>Huai Si police detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen, and detective Yang Yunfeng, learned that the monks and tea servers at Yishou Temple at No. 121 Gansu Road were all using heroin instead of opium. They then secretly went to the address with Western detectives at around 7:00 PM on the 21st and arrested eight people, including the abbot Wang Kun, the guest master Yongming, Yinxi, Miaoshun, the nun Yueding, and the tea servers Lin Meisheng, Lu Shunan, and Ye A'gen, along with ten packs of heroin. They were taken to the police station and questioned. They learned that the abbot Fa Kun, Yimiao, and the guest master monk of Yuelin Temple at No. 822 Haining Road were also using the same heroin, which was delivered daily by the little monk Miaoshun from Yishou Temple. They then rushed to search, but they had already heard the news and hid the heroin, and nothing was found. Yesterday morning, the monks and tea servers of Yishou Temple were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Chiang Baolian detailed the case and stated that the tea server Lin Haifeng had no addiction and admitted at the police station that eight packets of drugs were delivered daily by a certain agency, which he received and handed over to the monks. The nun Yueding was one of those who used drugs in the temple. He asked that they be severely punished according to the law. Judge Jiang Shuzi clarified the facts and ordered that they be returned to custody to await sentencing.</p>

The watchman Hu Song Daxing shouted, but was tied up. As a result, the three people Da Paitou, Xu, and Chen murdered him and buried the body in a wasteland on Yishan Road. After the incident, the police at Gordon Road arrested the criminals Chen Xuebao, Fei Jinbao, Shen Qifa, and Miao Qitai from Jiangbei, as well as the receiver of stolen goods Chen Daoying and Xu Wenyi, and five suspects, including Bu Jinshan, and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The receivers of stolen goods hired lawyers Yan Fangang, Yu Enliang, and Wang Yaotang to defend them. The verdict was delivered and awaiting pronouncement. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Jiang Shuzi came to court to pronounce the verdict: Chen Xuebao and Fei Jinbao were each sentenced to life imprisonment, Shen Qifa and Miao Qitai were each sentenced to six years imprisonment, Chen Daoying and Xu Wenyi were each fined 500 yuan, and the remaining five people, including Bu Jinshan, were acquitted.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Reached 1,020 Yuan in Legal Tender - For One Taels of Gold - Futures were Controlled by Small Counter Market - Closing at 6,780 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was erratic and opaque, with prices rising and falling. From noon onwards, prices stabilized and strengthened, entirely driven by the squaring of positions by both bulls and bears. Because there was an expectation that the HSBC small counter's US dollar exchange rate would be difficult to sustain, people were uncertain and apprehensive. Initially, prices rose to 6,925 yuan, following the previous day's surge. However, they were soon pushed down by those selling gold. The black market US dollar exchange rate eased from tight to loose, inevitably adding to the selling pressure, and prices retreated to a low of 6,840 yuan. Although the Shanghai Gold Exchange then stopped new buying and selling, it was reported that the Shanghai West faction continued to buy small amounts. At noon, prices rebounded, and in the afternoon, they continued to stabilize and strengthen, eventually rising by another 17 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was around 100,000 taels. For deferred settlement (August to September), buyers offered sellers 120 yuan, gradually increasing to 110 yuan. Even at the end of the month, the price was still more than 100 yuan cheaper than the HSBC small counter's US dollar exchange rate. The cash price surge expanded, breaking the record for the largest price increase in recent market history. In the early morning, Xin Fengxiang bought 10 taels from Yongfeng, with the price already rising to 9,480 yuan. Subsequently, Yi Da bought another 30 taels, and Heng Ji sold 10 taels to Chengda, both at 9,500 yuan. Mingfeng bought 10 taels from Dingsheng for 9,630 yuan. Yutai Feng sold 10 taels to Shun for 9,660 yuan. In the afternoon, Tian Yuan sold 10 taels to Hesheng for 9,850 yuan, and another 10 taels for 9,860 yuan. Da Feng sold 10 taels to Chi Da, and Yongfeng Yu sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop, both for 9,880 yuan. Tian Yuan then sold 10 taels each to Hesheng and Chengda for an unprecedented high of 9,960 yuan, a horizontal increase of 660 yuan from the previous day. Gold jewelry also continuously increased seven times, rising by a huge 70 yuan, also producing a new high of 1,020 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Rise Seventeen Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) followed the previous day's surge. With the black market US dollar exchange rate difficult to settle at 4.625 yuan, there was heavy short covering. The market opened at 6,905 yuan at 9:15 AM, a gap up of 45 yuan. Deda and Tianyuan actively bought, especially keen to cover short positions, and the price continued to rise by 20 yuan, reaching 6,925 yuan. Yong'an, Xiang Xingyong, and Shi Helai sold, and the price quickly retreated by 35 yuan to 6,890 yuan. After Chengji and Yida bought, the price was raised again to 6,910 yuan. The black market US dollar exchange rate eased, and Litai and Renchengyong sold. With fewer buyers, the price gradually retreated to 70 yuan, lowering it to 6,840 yuan. At noon, Hesheng and Dafeng absorbed the selling, and the price began to rise again. The noon closing price was 6,862 yuan. The market opened at 6,860 yuan at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, down 2 yuan. Litai and Chengji bought one after another, but because Xiang Xingyong and Hengji supplied the selling, the rise was very slow, gradually rising to 6,878 yuan. Xinfengyong sold, and the market closed at 6,877 yuan at 3:30 PM, a rebound of 17 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Based on the September US dollar settlement price of 4.6875 yuan, the price was 7,429 yuan, a premium of 552 yuan. Based on the HSBC small counter's US dollar exchange rate of 5.3125 yuan, the price was 6,555 yuan, a premium of 322 yuan. After the close, the price was 6,880 yuan. The daily price range was 85 yuan. The counter price of cash gold in gold shops was above 10,000 yuan, and the purchase price was 200 yuan lower. The bidding price was unavailable.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Prices Increase Seven Times Consecutively</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was raised seven times consecutively by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, for a total increase of 70 yuan, reaching an unprecedented high of 1,020 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Exchange Rate Eases from Tight to Level</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rate remained unchanged, and the small counter's US dollar exchange rate remained at 5.3125 yuan. The black market exchange rates for British and American gold were stagnant, effectively nonexistent. The US dollar exchange rate eased from tight to level. After the market opened in the morning, under conditions of limited supply and strong demand, the US dollar exchange rate softened again to a new tight price of 4.5625 yuan. Banque de l'Indochine had some interest, while American banks such as Citibank supplied selling, and Chinese banks also came to sell off their current month positions. The market situation immediately hardened back to 4.625 yuan for settlement. In the afternoon, Chinese speculative buyers also came to sell, resulting in a US dollar exchange rate of 4.6875 yuan, which was difficult to sell and could be settled. The market closed with a rise of 0.0625 yuan. The British gold rate was level, and trading was quite active, mostly between banks.</p>
<p>Chinese Speculators Liquidated Positions</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign telegraphic transfers for silver were strongly higher, and American silver was level. The exchange rates for all countries against Shanghai dollars contracted by 1.6 cents, recording a level. The early opening selling prices of banks in the domestic market were a spot British exchange rate of 2 shillings 8 and 1/8 pence and a US dollar rate of 4.625 yuan. The softest settlement was only 4.5625 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained level. The balance tax for silver was still 24.25. Later, Oriental Bank and Deutsch-Asiatische Bank successively bought current US dollars at 4.625 yuan from Chinese banks. Afterwards, Chinese speculators remained hesitant. Chinese banks sold a significant amount of August US dollars at 4.6215 yuan. Foreign banks and importers closed their positions. The underlying trend eased from tight to level. The closing prices were still a central gold rate of 2 shillings 8 and 1/8 pence and a US dollar rate of 4.625 yuan. In the afternoon, many Chinese speculators sold August US dollars at 4.6875 yuan. Foreign merchant banks turned cautious after absorbing the sales, so it was difficult to sell. By the 3:30 PM close, the spot rate and the September US dollar rate were at 4.6875 yuan for settlement, and the British gold rate was at 2 shillings 8 and 1/8 pence. Compared to the previous day, the US dollar was up 0.25 yuan, and the British gold rate was level.</p>
<h3>US Notes Sold for 23 Yuan, US Gold for 270 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: Cash had already reached 10,000 yuan for ten taels, so the exchange rates for British and American gold pounds also rose by 10 yuan each. The trend for British gold notes was relatively stable. The opening price for US notes was 1,982 yuan. After the opening, Da Chang, Tong Yi, Lemei, and other companies bought, raising the price to 2,000 yuan. Yingtai, Xiangyuan, Yongdinghe, Xingji, and others sold, causing the price to retreat to 1,975 yuan. The noon closing price was 78 yuan. The market opened at 78 yuan in the afternoon. After the opening, Da Gong and other companies bought, raising the price to 87 yuan. Yingtai, Xietaiyong, and others sold, causing the price to retreat to 80 yuan. The closing price in the evening was 1,983 yuan, an increase of 9 yuan from the previous day. The total transaction volume for the day was over 500,000 yuan. The spot rate continued to rise to 23 yuan and 20 cents. The trend for Hong Kong notes was firm and stable, and market prices leveled off. The price of Japanese gold notes rebounded slightly, retreating to 2.50 yuan in the evening market. The trend for Korean notes remained firm, rising to 1.92 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Understanding the Optimism for 20-count Yarn - Yarn Prices Too Expensive... hoarding Thread is not as Good as Stockpiling Yarn - Blue Phoenix Prices Surge... Cloth Factories have Switched to Buying Chinese Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market has shifted towards an upward trend, with the rising trend becoming more pronounced. This is due to the black market exchange rate shrinking, which has caused speculators to shift their focus and become optimistic. At the same time, raw materials are unusually expensive, which is related to the cost for factories. Furthermore, the situation for Japanese yarn has been quite positive recently. Examining the factors, 32-count yarn is approaching 3,000 yuan, 42-count yarn is at 4,000 yuan, and 20-count yarn is between 1,600 and 1,700 yuan. Comparatively, 20-count yarn is relatively cheaper. Therefore, speculators are shifting towards 20-count yarn for trading. Generally, those who are hoarding find it better to buy cheap 20-count yarn rather than expensive thread. Another explanation is that Japanese yarn is being shipped overseas, so 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn has already risen to 1,720 yuan, exceeding the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn by several tens of yuan. As for the prices of Chinese miscellaneous brands of yarn, they continue to rise, also due to the cheap prices. Cloth weaving factories in this city have all switched to buying Chinese yarn instead. In this regard, the foundation for 20-count yarn is more solid. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,708 yuan, and the low price is 1,688 yuan. According to market reports, there are both large long and short positions in Double Horse yarn, and the future may see a period of contention. In the afternoon, yarn traded on the stock exchange rose by 26 to 35 yuan, and cotton cloth also rose by 80 to 90 cents.</p>
<p>Double Horse Opened Higher: Due to the increase in yarn prices traded on the stock exchange in the afternoon of the previous day, people were enthusiastic. The first transaction jumped 23 yuan to 1,695 yuan. The price fluctuated within the 96-97 yuan range for a long time. After 9:00, it was reported that the opening price on the stock exchange rose again by 20 yuan, boosting morale and increasing buying interest, with heavy short covering. The price gradually rose to 1,708 yuan. It was also said that a certain major player was selling off outside the 700 yuan range, and at the same time, the price on the stock exchange fell slightly, and sentiment eased, falling to 1,688 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers bought back, and the price returned to 1,696 yuan at the close, an increase of 24 yuan from the previous day. The half-day transaction volume was 5,550 bales. The amount of purchases by each firm is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 50, Counterparts 5,500, Total 5,550</p>
<p>The gold horse futures rose again and again, and the situation became more vigorous. Under the stronghold of the bulls, the market was renewed, and there was a phenomenon of spring bamboo shoots after rain. When the market opened in the morning, although American cotton fell, people were mostly optimistic, especially the factory orders opened sharply, rising by more than 20 yuan, so the futures yarn rose accordingly, and new highs continued to emerge. The September contract opened at 1,600 yuan, followed by 9 yuan, the October contract was 1,615 yuan, and the November contract was even more energetic, reaching 1,646 yuan, an increase of 13 yuan. Afterwards, the market price gradually increased due to speculators on the left and right, and new peaks were often seen. The noon closing was slightly lower, with the September contract at 1,595 yuan, the October contract at 1,612.5 yuan, and the November contract at 1,640 yuan, each rising by 0.5 to 7 yuan. The front market traded 10,940 bales. In the afternoon, the market situation was even stronger, and the rising trend became more apparent. The buying sentiment permeated the entire market, especially the short-covering, so the price reached its peak, and at the closing time, a new high price was seen once again. The September contract once rose to 1,605 yuan, the October contract to 1,630 yuan, and the November contract to 1,660 yuan. Afterwards, due to scattered sales by retail investors, there was a slight decline of 3-5 yuan. As a result, the September contract closed at 1,600 yuan, up 9.5 yuan, the October contract was 1,628 yuan, up 16 yuan, and the November contract was 1,654 yuan, a huge increase of 21 yuan. The difference between the closing prices of near and distant months was 53.5 yuan. The whole day traded 21,120 bales, an increase of 6,580 bales from the previous day. Also, as of the 31st, the amount of deposits in three months was 20,600 bales, with 8,070 bales in September, 10,360 bales in October, and 2,170 bales in November. In terms of trends, since the fluctuations in other markets are narrow, general speculators abandon them and seek this. Therefore, the table surface expands and the transaction becomes more frequent, but although the market price has more opportunities for continued growth in the future, it is also advisable to pay attention to selling at high prices. The opening and closing high and low prices for the day are recorded on the left (based on the net price).</p>
<h3>Although Fine Velvet is Stagnant - The Public Welcomes Coarse Velvet - The Price of Lan Gong Rises Suddenly by Seven or Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has entered a period of straight rises without any intention of returning. As a result, the turnover has been greatly reduced. However, coarse velvet cotton is favored by people, and they are collecting and hoarding it. Therefore, recently, the fine velvet has been slow and stagnant, which is the infinite mystery of speculators. However, some people say that although the price of fine velvet is expensive, the profit margins for weaving thread are still high for the factories. Yesterday, the transaction of coarse velvet was extremely prosperous, and the price of Lan Gong cotton suddenly rose by seven or eight yuan. The selling prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai foreign cotton transaction market situation has weakened due to the recent decline in American cotton, the purchase intention of all parties is still excited, and the transaction is not bad. Only American cotton has had few orders for many days, and sales are less than 200 bales. However, Brazilian cotton has become the target of the public, and most of the flower companies are constantly renewing their orders.</p>
<h3>Grain: Saigon Rice Arrives - Spot Rice Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The amount of foreign rice directly transported from Saigon has recently decreased slightly. Yesterday, the French company's General Xia Fei steamboat arrived in Shanghai, transporting 5,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, and a large amount of lumber from Luzon. Therefore, it was anchored at floating buoys 12 and 13. After the lumber is unloaded, the foreign rice will be unloaded at the Gonghexiang Wharf (Zu).</p>
<p>The market situation for foreign rice yesterday: first fell and then stabilized, with the market showing signs of rotating. The reason for the early market was that Xinyi continued to sell 1,000 tons of Xiaojiaolu goods in the new transaction of foreign rice, priced at 149 yuan. There were also continued negotiations on other things, and people's hearts were already soft. Following the public sale of Siamese rice in public warehouses, the authorities in the concession also approved hundreds of tons of broken rice at 101 yuan, and people's hearts became even weaker, and the market once fell. However, the hoarding households did not decline, rumors favored the buying side, and the mainland's local street also asked about the price while it was flat, especially the large households with intentions, and the market gradually returned to its previous level. As a result, it was once again close to the previous market: Xiaojiao Yinghua Company's spot price was 146 yuan for the second grade, and the high-priced goods even reached 148.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice also opened at 149.5 yuan, and the total transaction of broken rice was about 1,000 tons. The current transaction of foreign rice was 16,000 bags.</p>
<p>The market for thick and thin japonica domestic rice changed as the weather cleared. The rain hindered each cargo from arriving in port, causing the arrival of goods to suddenly surge. People's hearts were exceptionally weak. The local shops relaxed their stomachs, and the cargo owners all lowered their prices to get rid of their goods. As a result, the market prices of both thick and thin japonica rice fell by 1-2 yuan. Ten-opened Nangang early rice was 152 yuan and 150.5 yuan. Wuxi original package special japonica was 154 yuan, Dashi white japonica was 149 yuan, Su Ci was 144-5 yuan, and Pudong new japonica was also lower by about 2 yuan, opening at 157 yuan and 156.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: A Large Batch of Raw Soybean Oil - Reportedly Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, edible oil turned from rising to falling. It was reported that a certain party took advantage of this high price to ship a large batch of raw soybean oil from Tianjin to Shanghai. The first batch of 2,000 barrels can be started. There are still thousands of barrels to be transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the oil painting manipulation is lacking, and the heart suddenly became panic. The market was consistently easy to tighten. The Qingdao raw oil dark plate was relaxed to 310 yuan, and there was still no owner. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil also started to rise and then flattened, and the trend was tired. The general market sold 700 dans of clear oil, 300 dans of rapeseed oil, and 2,000 dans of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory. 200 barrels of rapeseed oil from Taishan and Lide factories. (Price detailed in the market price column)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Prices Repeatedly Seen for Sugar - The Rising Trend is Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market appetite for sugar remained strong, and the rising trend continued to be weak. The stock market futures 24 crude white, the one to be delivered at the end of August was 136 yuan, 40 yuan 2 angles, 37 yuan 6 angles, in the afternoon 40 yuan, 38 yuan 2 angles, 37 yuan 9 angles, up 2 yuan 9 angles. September 10 period was 142 yuan, 38 yuan and a half, 39 yuan and 9 angles 6 angles, 41 yuan in the afternoon, 39 yuan 8 angles, 39 yuan 6 angles up 3 yuan. The council divided spot price 24 crude white July to the cargo 139 yuan, 40 yuan to the afternoon 4 yuan and 8 angles, June 138 yuan and 3 angles, to 39 yuan and a half in the afternoon, up 4 yuan.

The factory's No. 1 Ice was 173 yuan, and Jingming Ice was 175 yuan, up 15 yuan. Today there are 100 packs of sugar shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Bond Market is Brewing for Change</h3>
<p>The bond gray market was still brewing yesterday, with the transaction becoming less and less frequent, and both sides were looking forward to something. The most recent hope is that the market price and trading will begin to develop after receiving the first payment of the tenth interest due this time and the first payment should be received at the end of August. During this brewing period, it may not be easy to take any action, because both the long and short sides are watching. Dahua bought in the morning, and the sellers were still Xinhua, Naidechang, Dingkang, etc., with market prices falling between five points and one angle. In the afternoon, Yixing bought in, and the sellers were still No. 16 and Dingkang Xinchang. If Xinhua and others continue to be released, there is a situation of dumping the whole basket, and the spot goods are flooded, which is really confusing. As a result, the market price was uneven, high and low between five points and one angle, and the transaction was only five or six hundred thousand yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Greatness and Ordinariness</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>Young people often yearn for great careers and great achievements, wanting to be heroes and heroines admired by all. However, few people realize that true greatness accumulates from the ordinariness of daily life.</p>
<p>The hardships and difficulties of circumstances, the mediocrity and monotony of life, often make young people doubt their future. Some become discouraged, and others lose their courage and ambition. Although they yearn to be great figures, they do not know that greatness grows out of ordinariness.</p>
<p>It is not that there are no overnight successes in the world, but these often result from long-term, arduous struggles, not from opportunistic shortcuts.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill, who strives for his country with "blood, sweat, and tears," did not rise to prominence by accident. Forty years ago, when he was a 24-year-old youth fighting in Africa, he already displayed courage, composure, and a persistent attitude. Nine years ago, when Hitler rose to power as an unknown, he already saw, with his keen vision, that the rise of the National Socialist Party was a crisis for Europe and a threat to Britain. For nine years, he consistently cried out, hoping to draw the nation's attention. Churchill's greatness is not accidental.</p>
<p>All great figures accumulate their greatness from ordinary daily life, fulfilling their responsibilities with dedication. As long as we hold our positions in this ordinary life, we possess a great spirit.</p>

<h3>Don't Miss the Opportunity</h3>
<p>— Xi Zhi</p>
<p>In my exquisite souvenir album, the ninth page still bears these two sentences: "Seize the opportunity, never hesitate!" It was written by an Austrian professor for me the day before I left school. I remember that after he finished writing these two sentences, signed his name, and added the date, he patted me on the shoulder and said, "Young man, there is a very cruel story behind this." The following is the story he told:</p>
<p>When I was still studying in Vienna, there was a sixteen-year-old boy in our class who was most loved. He had a handsome appearance, outstanding talent, diligence, gentleness, and great ambition. We gave him the nickname "Metternich" because we firmly believed that with his extraordinary knowledge, his future career would be no less than that of the great diplomat. Our only dissatisfaction was his meticulousness. Each time he came to school, he wore a newly pressed uniform, and his tie was neatly tied. When it was rainy, his father's chauffeur would drive a brand-new car to pick him up. However, he was a good person, not arrogant at all, and we all liked him very much.</p>
<p>One morning, "Metternich's" seat was empty. We knew the reason for this at lunchtime. His father was originally the head of a large financial institution and was arrested last night. It turned out that he was running a large-scale fraud scheme, which had harmed countless small businessmen. The newspapers printed the news of the fraud in large font, and even published the photos of the defendant and his family.</p>
<p>At this point, we knew the reason for our unfortunate classmate's absence. He was ashamed. The newspapers continuously published his father's fraud for half a month, and during these two weeks, his seat remained empty.</p>
<p>Later one day, the door opened, and "Metternich" slipped in, walked to his seat, and immediately opened his book. For two lessons, he never looked up from his book.</p>
<p>When the ten-minute break bell rang, we walked into the corridor as usual. However, "Metternich" walked straight to the end of the corridor, stood alone, facing away from us, staring out the window, as if something on the street had caught his attention. In fact, we knew that he was afraid of making eye contact with us.</p>
<p>We understood his broken heart at the time, and our whispers and laughter subsided. Obviously, he was waiting for us to express our friendship to him. But we didn't know how to approach him without hurting his self-esteem. We hesitated, and no one had the courage to make the first move.</p>
<p>We hesitated like this minute after minute. The bell called us back to the classroom. "Metternich" suddenly turned around and strode in, not even looking at us. His tightly closed lips looked even paler. After the morning classes, he hurriedly left the classroom, and no one had the opportunity to talk to him.</p>
<p>We all felt a bit guilty and wanted to find a way to atone for our mistake. But it was too late; he no longer gave us the opportunity. The next morning, his seat was empty again. We called his house to ask, and all we found out was that after returning home from school that day, he suddenly announced to his mother his decision to drop out of school and immediately left Vienna to become an apprentice at a pharmacy in a small town. Thus, such an outstanding talent became silent and unknown due to our hesitation.</p>
<p>Young people! It is not enough to only understand, care for, and hold friendship in your hearts. We must also have courage, the courage to act on what we think, because the opportunities to do good and help others are fleeting! (Royalties donated to scholarship fund)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Storms</p>
<p>How could he know the intentions of an insidious and ruthless opium addict like Shang Laoer?</p>
<p>"I said, Mao Bao, you are really not wrong at all." Shang Laoer exhaled a thick cloud of smoke, looking at Liu Tuzi with a half-smile. "Can we just let such a big deal go by so easily? To be honest, first of all, I'm not convinced! How do you know that the opera taught by her father is definitely better than mine? Even if he really has some little tricks, his daughter has already kowtowed to me, and he can't take my apprentice away. Besides, if they didn't want to learn opera from me, why didn't they just say so clearly? Why did they have to wait so long, tell so many lies, until I came to their door myself before they would tell the truth? This kind of thing is really too欺人 (bullying), and I will never let them go if I can!"</p>
<p>Although Shang Laoer's voice was still very low, the insidious aura it contained was indeed more terrifying than Liu Tuzi's jumping and shouting.</p>
<p>"So what do you plan to do?" Now Liu Tuzi had put down his legs and was leaning against the wooden wall calmly.</p>
<p>Shang Laoer did not answer immediately, continuing to walk around the room three or four times.</p>
<p>"I don't plan to do anything now either." A smile suddenly appeared on his dark gray face; however, whoever saw this smile would feel as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on their spine. "Anyway, there's no use being impatient about this kind of thing. Let's wait a few days for my nephew to come to town and report the news. No matter what, I don't believe she can escape from my palm!" (192)</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Map for the Blind</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>American educators, seeing that some children with weak eyesight are in danger of becoming blind if they continue to use their eyesight as usual, have set up eyesight conservation classes to protect their inherent eyesight. These classes are specially designed for students with severe myopia or those who are nearly blind, and use soft and appropriate light, as well as extra-large characters on blackboards and textbooks as educational tools. They also teach them the characters and typewriters used by the blind, so that they can continue their education even if they unfortunately become blind. The maps used by these children are the same as the raised maps used by blind children. All mountains, seas, rivers, and rivers can be grasped by hand, which is also a unique educational method. The picture shows two students in the eyesight conservation class studying a map of the United States.</p>

<h3>Disney's Third Cartoon, "Fantasia," Has a New Style</h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>After two years of effort, Walt Disney's third feature-length masterpiece, "Fantasia," has finally been completed and released in the United States. Disney put a lot of effort into designing "Fantasia." According to his own statement, this film is different from the past. The release period will be longer, and perhaps even after his death, "Fantasia" will still be screened around the world. The main reason is that "Fantasia" is accompanied by music, and music is an art form that has permanence.</p>
<p>Indeed, in film history, "Fantasia" is the first time movie fans have seen a film entirely set to classical music! The film is accompanied by great music, strings, and orchestras, all composed by eight world-renowned music directors. Therefore, when the film is released, it is filled with musical atmosphere, because Disney wanted "Fantasia" to be made in this way, so the music is particularly rich.</p>
<p>The musical part has a playing time of two hours, with only a fifteen-minute break in the middle. Therefore, when the film is released, there will be no newsreels as a prelude, and even the lengthy credits of artistic, photographic, and technical consultants will be eliminated. Indeed, Disney's success in the musical part of "Fantasia" this time is due to the help of many great musicians.</p>
<p>When Disney was making "Fantasia," according to friends close to him, he rarely talked about the art and business of making films, only saying how the film should be made, focusing his energy on directing. If he ever decides to write his autobiography, he may ask Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and the Three Little Pigs to tell his story.</p>
<p>However, when someone talked to him about "Fantasia," he was very happy to tell people that this was a new attempt in his life and that it had given him a lot of experience. He said that he did not want to destroy the legend of film, but if tradition was never broken, film would never have progressed to this day. Therefore, those who are bound by tradition are nothing more than fools.</p>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: Where Does a Powerful Family Forcibly Carry Her Home?</p>
<p>His power is as great as the heavens, what power do we have to oppose?" Yuan Yuan said, "Father-in-law of the nation, father-in-law of the nation! Just because he's the father-in-law of the nation doesn't mean he can eat people like a tiger or a wolf! You're telling me this today, it's too late! I only hate you for not telling me sooner!" The stepmother said, "Good young lady, you must understand, they said this to me, how could I dare disobey? Even if I had told you last night, there would have been no way to escape. We can't just run away, they'll be everywhere trying to catch us, right? Alas! This is the plight of ordinary people." As the two were talking, they suddenly heard a commotion downstairs. It was Tian Hongyu and Flower Butterfly bringing many servants with them. The stepmother hurriedly left Yuan Yuan and went downstairs to greet them. Today, Tian Hongyu had brought eight thousand taels of silver, all packed in a box, and handed it over to the stepmother, saying that he would take Yuan Yuan away today. As he and Flower Butterfly walked up to the dressing room, Yuan Yuan stood with her back turned, both crying and laughing, and in great pain. At this moment, Tian Hongyu walked forward, patted Yuan Yuan's fragrant shoulder, and said, "Yuan Yuan, I'm taking you back today! I can't bear to see you, with your beauty that could topple a nation, fall into the red dust, so I spared no expense of ten thousand gold to protect the flower and bring you back to the capital, to be kept in a golden house. I hope you don't mind that I'm old, right?" Yuan Yuan turned around and said with her head lowered, "Thank you, Lord. But although this humble woman is willing to entrust herself to you, why not choose an auspicious day so that I can depart with composure?" Flower Butterfly had already said from the side, "Today is an auspicious day and a propitious time. The father-in-law of the nation has already chosen it. I congratulate you on your happy marriage and wish you both many happy stories." Tian Hongyu also said, "We could have waited a bit, but because I have asked for leave to go south, there is not much time left, so I want to return home as soon as possible. I will take care of everything myself. You just need to come with me." Yuan Yuan knew that if Flower Butterfly was not involved, things might not have happened so quickly or so badly. She could have eloped with the poet and avoided being taken away. Now they are using such swift methods that it is difficult for me to deal with. (149)</p>
<h3>Autumn in the Chrysanthemum Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Shao Xian</p>
<p>(IV) Cheng Yuqing's Many Romantic Affairs (Continued)</p>
<p>But in practical terms, his mistress, Miss Hua, deserves the most credit. However, such an abnormal thing happened. One day, Wang Yuqing secretly bought some kind of anesthetic and made Hua Xiaofang swallow it. Soon, she became drowsy and lost consciousness. Yuqing took advantage of this opportunity to steal all her valuable jewelry and cash, which he sold to support his own extravagance. Later, she had no other way to go and ended up in poverty. After entering the Wang family, Yuqing found new love and abandoned Hua Xiaofang. In a fit of anger, Hua Xiaofang returned to the sea, intending to rise like a cloud out of the cave, but by this time, Hua Xiaofang's beauty had faded, and she had acquired an addiction. She had long lost her original appearance. In this state, how could she attract attention? Thus, her situation worsened day by day. Hua Xiaofang had already spent all her possessions on Yuqing. Later, she even became homeless and became a beggar, dying of madness. Such an ending can truly be said to be self-inflicted. But Cheng Yuqing's ingratitude is also hateful. Yao Qing never lacked this view at the time, but because Yuqing's relationship with Yao Qing was deep, Yao Qing only had to let things take their natural course, even though she expressed dissatisfaction. Later, because Yuqing represented her teacher in speaking about opera for Hua Huilin, she went to Hua's house every day. At the same time, Yuqing was also in Huilin's troupe. Because of this relationship, Yuqing had an affair with Huilin's younger sister, Huiwen, and soon they also lived together. At that time, Yao Qing thought that Yuqing could finally settle down and study, so she did not oppose this. Unexpectedly, Yuqing's nature was difficult to change, and he even got into the trouble of beating and humiliating her teacher. Truly, people's hearts are not ancient, and the world is declining!</p>
