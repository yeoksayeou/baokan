<p>社評</p>
<h3>南太平洋危機益迫</h3>
<p>這幾天南太平洋形勢的嚴重，隨着時間而增加。吾人試將最近各種事態的進展，重爲檢討覆按，則可知民治陣綫國家採取的步驟，異常堅決，循着預定的計劃，先後實施；絲毫沒有猶豫的意嚮；蓋明知一切已到最後關頭，惟有以武力打擊侵略，以信心獲取勝利，只須時間來臨，這不可避免抑且無法避免的南太平洋大戰，或將終於爆發。</p>
<p>以最近兩日間關於遠東事件的進展言，最令人興奮的，是澳大利亞已有六十萬兵士準備總動員，澳政府並報告此數係表明澳洲已統制國家的人力，從事於軍役，戰事工業及社會各方面之戰爭基礎。同時，澳相孟席斯已取消赴澳洲各處考察的程序，其理由爲事態發展，不容稍緩，必須立即返都，參與昨日的內閣會議，以應付非常的局勢。這顯然是說明了遠東已屆準備採取行動的階段；更足以證明無論冒險者向何方面行進，澳洲必以其全力協助同一陣綫的國家、駢肩作戰，去抗拒可能的侵略。</p>
<p>至於菲島，在表面上所顯示的，僅限於訓練民衆，燈火管制，防禦空襲等等，其軍事上的計畫，爲一般人所不及知，但目前所能明瞭者，則自本月起，所有菲島陸軍常備兵與後備兵一律併入美國陸軍；而菲島的軍營，則將於下月一日起，由美軍接收。這一舉措，非但把菲島整個的武力，放在美軍統一指揮之下，抑且以事實表示美國以全力保衛菲島，把牠作爲美國在南太平洋上的前哨站，絲毫不允許侵略者有任何企圖的。</p>
<p>復據昨日電訉，美國陸軍已於即日起在太平洋沿岸。舉行空前大演習。參加部隊，達十萬員名，並有摩托化部隊及砲兵一萬五千員名；而演習的主題爲「沿海侵略防禦戰」。從美國這回演習看來，至少具有一種潛在的深切意義，這就是說縱使美國的海軍有事於太平洋，國內沿岸的防務，並不空虛，儘有龐大的實力，足以保衛。此外，吾人更應注意到美總統方在海上垂釣與邱吉爾會談之際，國內忽有陸軍空前大演習的舉措，吾人似不能不承認其間必含有若干微妙的作用。</p>
<p>綜上所述，此兩日間遠東事態的進展，却眞是隨着時間而增加了嚴重性。吾人研討一般局勢，有下列幾點感想</p>
<p>第一，不管日本迭次所謠傳的民治國軍事同盟是怎樣，日內閣情報局發言人石井所承認的ABCD各國企圖「包圍」日本又是怎樣，我們在目前應得認識，民治陣綫國家對於抗拒侵略，維護人類文明，旣具同一信心，則此後南太平洋掀起大戰，爲共同利害着想，ABCD在行動上必歸於一致。</p>
<p>第二，南太平洋大戰的導火錢，世人均集中注意力於泰國。在過去，吾人對於泰國的行動。誠無法予以宥恕，然而昨日盤谷所傳來的消息，是「吾人確已經歷逆境，然在患難中已知誰爲友人矣」的明朗語句，又傳泰國現已籲請人民一致起來反對可能的侵略者，謂獨立可以失去，光榮則須保持，甚至勗勉人民於不得不退却時，應燒燬其城鎭，五穀，森林及道路橋樑云云，這些，都足以說明泰國已在覺醒中。</p>
<p>第三，羅斯福的游艇雖仍泊在霧中，但是經過一週餘與邱吉爾會談的結果，最低限度說，必可使日本對民治國的決心，不再有所懷疑。羅斯福已定於本星期內遄返白宮，此後行動，當極明白堅決，世人斷無『如墮五里霧中』之感。</p>
<p>第四，誠如駐倫敦的某國記者所言，英國至今春爲止，尙圖努力避免在遠東作戰，但自蘇德戰爭爆發後，此項態度已有劇變，日本倘再南進，英國即將毫不遲疑採取必要之行動。吾人更知英國前任情報大臣特夫古柏，已奉政府特殊使命，前來遠東坐鎭，而英國在星加坡軍事方面之積極佈置，更不待言說，英國的態度，也無庸疑慮。</p>
<p>當茲局勢日益迫切，危機間不容髮的時際，吾人期望冒險者審察利害，度德度力，不要輕舉妄動，儘有從容自省，挽回自已刧運的機會。</p>
<h3>王世杰稱政府決心　穩定滬市場法幣</h3>

<p>歐戰叢談（七五）</p>
<h3>民治陣綫的聯絡員</h3>
<p>然而霍浦金不顧別人輕視，抓住機會就力圖發展。他的活動範圍漸由社會事業推廣至其他方面。到一九三四年已引起人家的歧視，共和黨方面，且有人反他利用救濟名單上巳有三百五十萬人，他可以說是全國最大的「雇主」了。</p>
<p>一九三九年一月，羅斯福推舉他為商務部長，參議院可決時，却很費周折，因為大家對於這樣一個來歷不明的人，一躍而爲這樣的大官，有點覺得人地不相宜。在總統的意思，一方面想利用部長的地位，給他個副總統候選資格。再者霍浦金，體弱多病，給他較優越的職位，以資調養。霍浦金的地位旣已愈高，他的政敵也愈多，如都格威爾和內政部長伊克斯之類，向他攻擊最力。</p>
<p>一九四〇年五月，歐戰急轉直下，法國崩潰的朕兆已見。這時白宮中函電交馳，公務百倍繁重。霍浦金便被邀到白宮住宿，俾得早夕在總統一旁。他傳達事情，十分迅速，並且消息靈通，應對如流。國際局勢最緊張的時候，他夙興夜　，歷兩星期而無倦容。總統從沒有知道他的至友有如此能耐，就越發看重他了。</p>
<p>羅斯福對於霍浦金的公私交誼，都出乎常情。新政派激進份子向總統說他壞話的時候，總統向不表示意見，却暗中照顧霍浦金。霍浦金在貧病交迫的時候，總統慨然延私人翳生，給他治療，愛惜可謂無微不至。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統夫人，對於社會事業，向亦甚感興趣，不時向霍浦金有所獻議。他對於總統夫人的意旨，自然很重視。總統夫人也禮如上賓。一九三　七年，霍浦金夫人逝世的時候，總統偕命體閣員親柱送殯，總統夫人且把無母的幼女第安娜領到白宮裏撫養，愛如己出，住了三年之久。</p>
<p>一九四〇年八月，總統致函霍浦金，准其辭去商務部長，措辭比給別個部長刻板的批准書，至少要懇切二十倍。總統的書翰裏說：「閣下可卸去現職，但僅以官職爲限，不及其他。爾我交誼當一如往昔。」</p>
<p>一九四〇年秋，羅斯福競選連任，霍浦金竭其全力，代法萊主持選舉運動，他先代表總統到芝加哥，出席民主黨全國代表大會，部署一切，此後又隨總統在紐約，波士頓各地演說，結果獲得空前的成功。至此總統對他的寵信，又進一層。</p>
<p>是年底，大選完畢，總統帶了這位老友，坐了游艇，出巡加勒賓海，休閑身心。這時總統把心裏籌劃成熟的「民治國援助法案」和盤托出。</p>
<p>至於本年一月間，總統派他爲專使的事，却是他做夢也想不到的。在此事發生前的兩星期，總統曾向他打趣道：「哈萊（霍浦金的小名），你想被炸彈擊中的光景怎樣？你不曾打算過乘飛機旅行嗎？我聽說那些防空室中擠得非常厲害呢。」霍浦金照例也把打趣的話回答。他以爲總統不過隨便向他開玩笑而已，決不會有什麼嚴重的事故，殊不知總統早已成竹在胸，故意秘而不宣罷了</p>
<p>一九四一年一月三日，總統出其不意，突在新聞報道席上宣佈，說已派定霍浦金，以特使名義，爲個人代表前往英國。事後，總統情報秘書歐萊，　把這事吿訴霍浦金。</p>
<p>「你替我想想看！」他情不自梵地向歐萊說。「只要想一分鐘好了。我是幹社會事業的人。我的父親是個皮匠，我的母親是個小學敎員。我現在要去和英國首相邱吉爾和英國政府諸公晤談，眞叫我摸不着頭腦了。」後來霍沛令專使到了英國，和英國各界領袖晤談的有三百人之多。他和邱吉爾首相更一見如故。</p>
<p>羅斯福派他出任特使的用意，是要等他歸國之後，在完成國防及援助民治陣綫計劃中，担任重要工作。霍浦金在出發前，對於英國各種需要，早已瞭如指掌，比任何美國人要知道得詳盡。回憶美國參加上决歐戰前，威爾遜總統也會派遺政治顧問好斯上校出使歐洲，結果與英國外相格萊發表共同宜言。至於霍浦金此行的結果，在他出發之前，已可逆料了。</p>
<p>霍浦金向白宮的朋友們公開表示，他不愛高官厚祿。他現在最重要的職責，是在主持民治陣綫援助法實施事宜。他的大部份工作則在白宮二樓林肯寢室中辦理。他在室中接聽電話，往往達數小時之久。這樣的一種工作，對於這樣一個不愛虛榮不貪錢的人，實是莫大的興奮。每當忙裹偷閑憑几小息的時候，這位伊沃華州的小夥子想到自己正目覩着歷史的演化，而他自己呢，對於這種大時代的蛻變，與有力焉。（完）</p>

<p>洋米昨市初定後疲、市價曾有一二元出入、早市因本街週一天晴隨市略辦、而皮球幫等投機客囤亦興緻濃厚、各洋米售價均見微砌三五角至元外、然價勗後實銷即已不繼、且時局和緩、定貨通暢、業外客囤已無意添辦、一般浮戶散戶則以獲利求脫、市塲中賣氣立濃、各米售價站而復落、小絞早市大至一百二十五元一角者又回小至一百二十四元半、四元、三元、收市祇一百二十二元半、英華司小紋一百五十二元、乃自一百五十一元半至一百五十一元、二號暹米早市一百四十四元、繼自一百四十三元半、三元、至一百四十二元半、碎米一度會開一百十元、後乃一百零九元亦乏受主、結果大致與週六收價相似、而一部份反較小數角、成交現米的一萬包之譜、英華司亦祇四五百噸、若一號西貢高貨早開百三十六七元、後僅百三十四五元、中關百三十三元、三號百二十五元、特別暹羅百四十四元半、一號暹羅百三十二三元、二號百二十二元半、百二十二元、次百二十一元、敏黨高百三十八元半、百三十六元、中關百三十二元、百三十元、次百一十六七元、茄佛米百三十二元、百三十一元、高百三十六元、小絞銀行棧早開百二十五元、後僅百二十四元、百二十三元半、外棧自百二十四元、後至百二十二元半、荷蘭米百三十四元、東京砶尖高自百五十六元、次至百十二元、碎尖九十六元、九十四元、次九十一元、九十元、</p>

<h3>洋粉滯銷見疲</h3>
<p>昨現洋粉市况、已轉軟化、査上午開盤、形勢尙定、嗣以米價回鬆、獲利浮戶、趁高吐售、金龍粉初盤卅二元五六角、旋即回鬆至三十二元三角、砲台粉三十三元八九角、及香焦粉三十二元九角、比上週末微小一二角、鐘樓粉擯持乏交、惟連日本廠紛、以生產極微、存底早枯、本街需要者甚衆、老車回籠貨三十四元一二角、兵船三十四元、亦有三五百包新成交、市面形勢雖疲、暫時亦難過小、</p>
<p>新小麥來源、因附近戒備期中、到貨極少、各廠以收買不易、迭經放價、聞日廠方面收進一二百包、價爲四十四五元、因門市收貨不足、正向內地接洽中、</p>

<p>雙馬晨開因浮多了結、市態頗虛、首出價爲一千五百八十元、且賣戶頗湧、少頃疲至一千五百七十九元、但聞標金不跌、空頭扒補、又回上至一千五百八十六七元、不料取行所拍至遠期下墜、人心激動、又跌至一千五百七十六元、惟廣幫現紗交易不惡、市况略振、不過在此一千五百八十八九元之間、返往不下、有三四次之夥、豈料十二時左右、以標金不鬆、散空扒補、檯風一轉、買者即起、漲至一千六百〇六元收盤査半日間成交統計八千一百二十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如左、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市況、由萎頓而直上、起伏突形擴大、全日有十七元至三十三元之高低、晨初開出、首以外匯放長、現紗軋跌十餘元、一時多方觀望、進意淡漢、而空方與投機家則乘隙力塞、故八月期開盤爲一四四八元、竟軋跌十七元之巨、九月期爲一五三〇元、十月期爲一五三七元、各小五至七元、惟中途謠傳美日形勢鬆弛、且有某大戶吸收現紗之說、人心振奮、買戶待機而動、空方亦多抵補、塲中買氣濃厚、市價重堅、會一度回高至四元半至十七元不等、午收八月期爲一四五二元五角、九月期一五二七元五角、十月期一五四九元、較週六八九兩月尙小七元五角至十二元五角、十月期平、午後開盤初勢奇堅、蓋爲現紗與金市激漲所繫之故、是以升達一四八〇元開盤、竟軋漲二十七元半有奇、入後終因浮多與賣戶逢高出籠、遂復一致回降、結果八月期爲一四六〇元、九月期个五三五兀、十月期个五四四元、收市與上週末九月期除平外、八十兩月尙軋小五元、觀趨勢、其脚地尙未臻鞏固、蓋現紗與金市之高峯相較、已有背道之象、乃其最大主因、實爲客銷所阻、與廠方之賣出、故從事者尙宜注意及此也、茲列全日經過市價表於後、</p>
<h3>花價太昂　廠胃難展</h3>
<p>現棉情况頗昂、但消費未旺、標金雖步上、然紗價漲九不强、所以廠方吸收原料近滯無興也</p>

<p>蘇州河一帶橋樑、計外白渡橋·乍浦路橋·四川路橋、自戰後即由日方控制、茲日方仍將乍浦路四川路新閘路各橋斷絕往來、僅外白波橋一處可通虹口、其餘江西路橋盆湯弄橋、則由公共租界封鎖、老閘橋僅准行人往來、浙江路橋僅准車輛通行、天后宮橋車輛打人均可通行、惟各橋南北堍、均由武裝探捕駐守、實施搜查、</p>
<p>滬郊日軍大施戒備</p>
<p>本埠日軍連日在滬郊各地大施戒備、除將各橋樑予以封鎖外、爲預先預備計、早將沿租界四周之水陸交通綫嚴加封鎖、凡不能出示特別證明文件者、一概不准通行、又悉十日上午十時四十五分至十時五十九分間、日方曾將熙華德路橋樑封銷、斷絕交通、並由日海軍陸戰隊等、在該區內大事搜査、結果並無所獲、</p>
<p>各路電車行程縮短</p>
<p>公共租界電車公司、昨遵警務富局通知、自於昨晨起、已將山三洋涇橋至曹家渡之十六路無軌電車路綫暫爲縮短、祇駛至大自嗚鐘爲終點、同時行駛北火車站之五路六路七路電車、亦改在第一特區法院門前爲止、又二路九路一路－四路公共汽車、僅駛至靜安寺爲終點、十路七路公共汽車、均以康腦脫路公共汽車公司門前爲終點、須至十五日起、仍照以前行程往來開駛、</p>
<h3>泰德爾龐被拘案將　另有發展</h3>
<p>公開審問尙待訓令　連日偵查同謀案犯</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、駐華美按察使署代理執行官泰德爾龐、因盜用美政府財產、日前被捕、無力交保美金五千元、遂被押入華德路西牢、聞泰氏已要求按署派律師爲其辯護、諒可邀准、現按署正候華盛頓之訓令、以便在此</p>
<p>公開審問至於何時開庭、尙未可知、因美按察使海爾密克刻在美國休假也、聞華盛頓致美按署當局之訓令、可望於本週內到滬、以決定是吾囑海爾密克提早返此、或另派特別按察使審問此案、美按署檢察官希爾滋今（十一日）晨以文告發交報界、內暗示此案或有其他發展、並陳述上星期六逮捕泰氏之經過、但對偵査詳情、</p>
<p>不予披露、文吿謂、按察使海爾密克離職期間、美僑均奉公守法、無須加以法律上之注意、按署於執行官李却遜離滬休夏後、即派泰德爾龐爲代理執行官、負責款項及分發署員之薪金、並保管按著產業、連軍器在內、乃前星期六日、工部局警務處以蒐集之證據交渠、經一週之研究、渠始正式按泰氏犯盜用其所保管的美國財產之罪、按署執行官旣已離職、除泰氏外、僅副執行官命根夫人而已、故不得不請金夫人實行此似非婦女所應爲之任務、將泰氏</p>
<p>拘捕到案金夫人當即轉請警務處探長克賴埃登逮捕泰氏、文吿末稱、渠偵査泰氏之活動、殊爲繁忙、不能發表關於此案之其他詳情、蓋恐打草驚蛇、而免泰氏之同謀犯逃逸也、</p>
<h3>月下劇會舉行　大不列顚夜</h3>

<h3>留滬荷僑暫不撤退　荷輪並未停航</h3>
<p>遠東局勢未達最後階段　為商業關係荷僑仍觀望</p>
<p>芝沙丹尼輪下週可抵滬</p>
<p>荷蘭政府鑒於遠東局勢、日趨緊張、爲維護僑民安全計、曾下令勸吿在華僑民、應儘速撒離中國淪陷區、駐滬荷蘭總領事館奉命後、即於九日佈吿、凡「華族荷蘭臣民」希即前往領署報到、茲悉因遠東局勢目前尙未臻最嚴重階段、故荷僑前往登記、擬作撤退準備者、爲數甚少、惟證實前日離滬之荷輪芝巴德號、頭等艙位、幾盡爲英美由滬撤退僑民所佔、</p>
<p>撤僑措施未雨綢繆</p>
<p>據大中社記者探悉、自荷蘭領署發出佈告後、凡來滬或離去之荷籍人民、均須向領事館登記、但前往報到者僅數十人、現荷僑在滬總數、的爲四百餘人、其中百餘爲荷蘭人、餘爲荷籍華族人、在荷籍華族人中、一部爲在滬肄　之學生、其生活費用、按月由在荷印之家屬匯寄、其匯寄數額、必須經荷印當局核准、限制甚嚴、故甚少餘款、設遠東局　演進至最嚴重階段、則匯兌必發生困難、此輩生活甚屬可慮、自應爲之未雨綢繆、</p>
<p>在滬商業照常維持</p>
<p>荷蘭人二百餘名中、除婦孺外、男子僅九十餘人、多數在滬經營商業、現荷蘭在滬企業、有荷蘭·安達兩銀行·渣華輪船公司·上海保險公司·望萊保險公司·及進出口行十餘家、均照常維持、荷僑爲職務及業務上關係、不願即行離去、故實際上能奉令撤退甚少、</p>
<p>荷輪滯航原因所在</p>
<p>荷商渣華郵船公司、不定期班輪芝沙力號、此决由爪哇來滬、原定本月一日到滬、不料中途奉荷政府命撤退、中止來滬、近聞正班郵船芝楂連加號、亦中途回返巴城、在滬郵船芝巴德號、延期出口、致引　外界臆測、記者昨特往訪該公司、據該公　負責華員聲稱、芝沙力號不來、確奉政府命令、芝楂連加號郵船之不來上海、因芝巴德輪在滬延期回返爪哇、如芝楂連加號仍再來滬、船期恐有問題、因此中途開回、芝巴德輪遲遲出口者、有二種關係、一因出口貨擁擠、一時不及裝載、二適値颶風過境、因之延至十日中午始啟椗出口、仍依原航程、經厦門香港、及南洋各埠回返泗水、外傳荷輪停航一節、與事實不符、又稱雖遠東局勢緊張、惟目下航運仍無阻、又息該公司芝沙丹尼號郵船、下週內可到埠、</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、上星期五日颶風過滬時、沿虹橋路之電綫、有被吹墜於地者、致昨（十日）晨發生馬夫一人及馬兩匹觸電斃命之慘劇、並有三外人亦險遭非命、此三人係漢彌登大厦二四二號裕德洋行總經理旭斯德·博物院路六六號興成洋行股東薛森·及薛森女士、於</p>
<p>昨晨八時三十分、結伴策騎行於虹橋路上、旭氏所僱華籍馬夫一人、則跨馬前行、該馬忽觸及地面電綫、受震跌倒、馬夫被壓馬下、掙扎脫身時、不愼攀住電綫、立即觸電、與馬同斃、且薛森女士之騎、亦觸電綫受震躍起、薛女被拋墜地、幸遠離電錢、並未受創、僅稍擦傷而已、其</p>
<p>所乘之馬則已斃命、馬夫屍體、旋經法公董局救護車載去、聞墜地之雷錢、係日方軍用電綫、被颶風吹離電桿、墮於上海電力公司之主綫上、故電力極强、復垂至地面、觸者頓時喪生、事後電力公司已派員到塲修理、</p>

<p>巨籟達路的起端，正在淸晨菜市的擾攘中，走進了一爿肉莊，說明了來意，在店堂的背後，摸案着踏上狹小的扶梯，到了二樓，再登上臨時裝置的一架小木梯，那是三層擱，上面便是我要訪問的那位小學生的住所了。我因個子很長，進門的時候，必須彎着腰，低着頭，纔得入內。窒內當然祗有簡陋的陳設。那時他的母親，正坐在小矮凳上，身上躺着一個嬰孩，兩手正在揀選蔬菜，我說明了來意，她立刻起來把身上的嬰孩，很不經意的向床上一放，便用廣東口音的上海話來訴述他家中艱難的情形。另外有大小不等的三個小孩，都穿着不很整齊的衣杉，環立着注視我們的談話。</p>
<p>由她的談話中知道了她的家裏共有五個小孩，最大的就是我所欲訪問的一個十三歲的小學生，她丈夫在輪船上服務，一偭月難得有幾天住在家裏，每月的收入祗有百元，在這米珠薪桂的重壓下，維持一家七口的家庭，的確是十分困苦的，那時這位小學生適奉母命外出購物，沒有遇對。我又向他母親要了小學生在學校時的國，英，算作業，證實了他的成續，的確相當優良，允其是字寫得十分老練。</p>
<p>他母親叉吿訴我一伴値得記載的事實：「他的父親，因爲家境困難，實在無法　續担負他的學費，已託了朋友，替他找尋商店學徒的位子，他得到了這個消息，竟整整地哭了數小時，經他母親解勸，才行停止，但他仍準備着等他父親下决到家時，懇求他父親設法繼續求學，隔了數天，他聞知了本報有助學金的義羅，欣喜地吿訴了他母親，迅速的辦妥了應有的手續，數日來內心悲哀的情緒，立刻變了一種欣喜和熱望的態度」。那時床上的嬰孩，已在哭着，我也就起身別辭。</p>
<p>馬路上是那麽熱鬧，大公館的娘姨，手提着滿筐的魚肉匆匆的往來走着。（C）</p>
<p>大司务的兒子</p>
<p>拉都路三百九十三弄是一個平民區，兩旁都是高大的樓房，誰想到這條弄裏竟有無數的苦力，居住在數十間平房裏？這些平房，矮而簡陋，沒有門牌，倒使我楞住了，叫我到那裏去找這位姓洗的申請人呢？弄裏有十數個洗脚裸體的苦孩子在玩着遊戲，我便出申請表上的照片給他們看，問他們知不知道這個大孩子，都說不知，其中有一個十歲模樣的孩子他却知道，便領着我直走向弄裏去，才找到了姓冼的住家，無疑的，那也是一間平房，不幸這申請的孩子去看他母親去了，家裏只有一位十七八歲的女子，原來是姓冼的表姊。孩子的母親在外國人家幫傭，父親在香港當大司務，這孩子讀書非常聰明，暑期後將是初中二年級，上學年因成績優良，校中特予半費優待。暑期後仍准半費，所以他所申請的也只是學雜費的一牛。</p>
<p>貧苦之家不知有多少優秀的子弟被埋沒着，無力深造，這該是社會的損失吧！（T）</p>
<p>掙扎在生命綫上</p>
<p>在徐家滙路汶林路口的一家裁縫舖的假三層樓上，發現了一個意想不到的悲慘的家庭，住室的面積，只佔這個假三層的一半，地七舖着兩條破蓆，旣無床舖，也無凳椅，僅壁隅堆置着一些雜亂的什物，地中有一只鉛桶，別無長物。一個十二三歲的孩子和一個滿頭生着濃瘡的女小孩坐在靠壁的蓆子上，一個僂腰曲背的中年以上的男子，坐在沿窗一面的地上，唉聲嘆氣地已病得不成樣子。駭得我不敢跨進去，便和他們的隔鄰一對中年夫婦攀談起來，　這位女主人口裏，我知道了他們生活情形的半面，後來叉和這個十二三歲的男孩子問明了他們家庭的全貌。</p>
<p>他的母親和他的十一歲的弟弟上菜塲賣小菜還沒有回家，他的父親從前一度在隴海路某段當堅工，現在失業已久，眞是貧病交迫，不堪聊生。他的母親沒法，經人介紹，向「夜聲」借了三十元的小本貸金，販賣小菜，藉博蠅頭之利，以維一家五口的生命。他的弟弟，便是向本報申請助學金的孩子，暑期後將是六年級了，現在因放假，所以伴着他的母親，每天一淸早往徐家滙販了小菜，再担往雷米路菜市求售，據說每天可賺得二三四元。這大孩子自己，每天上午販賣蔴球或油條大餅，下半天賣冰棒，全家便這樣地過活着（T）</p>

<p>教育</p>
<h3>愛護天才</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>位朋友吿訴我兩個令人扼腕感慨的故事。有一位從小就表現着卓越的音樂天才的女同學，從小學而中學而大學以至出洋留美，都很順利地過去了。她能專修的正是她所擅長的鋼琴和梵娥林。大家正在希望她學成歸國，對音樂方面能够有重大的貢獻，不料消息傳來，她臂部生了罕見的癌症，醫生不許她再奏演樂器，結果她祇能放棄音樂而轉科了。</p>
<p>另外一位女同學，聰明活潑，也表現着光芒燦爛的前途，不料在大學畢業的前幾星期，却患了沉重的肺病，現在正在靜養中。</p>
<p>中國靑年能够有受學校敎育的幸運與機會的，原就不多。在道些受敎育的幸運兒中，有天才的就已經很少，有天才而能够順利地讀到大學和出洋留學的，當然更少。然而不料在這少數的天才幸運兒中，却父有一部份要受到無情的病魔的磨折，可見世界上成功的天才的稀少與可貴了</p>
<p>看了這種令人慨嘆的命運多舛的現象，我們並不必灰心喪志。我們要因此而更知道愛護天才。凡是有良好的機會與天才的人，也該因此而更知自愛。</p>
<h3>聾子的福言</h3>
<p>— 江新亮</p>
<p>薩摩克羅博士（Dr.　Samuel　Crowe）在美國喬斯霍金斯醫院耳科硏究所一九三九年的報吿書中吿訴我們說：「如果年靑的學生，每年能够有一决檢騐，幷且及早以輻射來治療那歐氏管周圍的淋巴組織的話，我們是可能把聾子的數目减低百分之五十的。』</p>
<p>這個著名的耳科研究所，正在埋頭試騐以鐳來防止（幷不說是醫治）耳聾。克羅博士與他的幾個助手，曾把一千五百個自八歲起至十四歲止的孩童，予以詳細的檢査與測騐；其所得結果是：兒童時代的耳聾，是可以防止的。成人的耳聾則與孩子的不同；因爲這種病在幼時還祇剛剛開始，直到地到長大成人之後，身心各方面的機構都牢固了，耳聾也就不容易醫治。</p>
<p>目前除了由科學家與醫師們在積極地及早預防耳聾之外，我們還可以看到許多的聾子學校。當那個發明電話的貝爾，在波期頓燈塔街十八號第一個開設他的「聲學學校』時，他就相信，聾孩的敎育應該儘早開始。時至今日，美國的聾校巳經多得不可勝數。其中規模最大的，常推費城外人氣山中的潘雪文尼亞聾校；當地的一般居民，都把它叫做「聾啞養育院」的。</p>
<p>在那座灰白色的建築中，現在有五百三十七名男女學童在讀書。他們有的簡直就聾得一點聲音都聽不出，就來這裏住讀。他們與那些不聾的學生同樣，可以得到德，智，體三方面的訓練。學校當局盡力使他們在十二年中讀完了九班；畢業後，就由校方介紹工作。</p>
<p>該校一位名叫韋爾特爵士（Sir　William　Wilde）的著名外科醫生，曾對人如此設道：『爲了錢財，人們寗願出賣他們的靈魂；爲了名譽，人們寗願犧牲他們的生命。……但對於我，當一個聾啞敎師乃是世間最快樂的事了。』由此可見那些敎師都是多麽的誠懇的啊。他們懷着一顆堅忍的，和善的，愉快的心，一心一意地就想使聾子們同樣也能獲得說話及做事的能力。</p>
<p>據他們對人稱：聾孩大多都是知道用功的。他們一班班的升上去，模仿着敎師們怎樣用嘴脣發音。同時，他們還學簡易的數學與如何寫信。等到稍有頭緒之後，校里就敎他們以各種實用的技能。潘雪文尼亞聾校的男生大概學印刷，木工，理髮與裁縫。女生則學縫級，洗濯，煮菜與打字。</p>
<p>孩子們照樣也有游戲。據校中人言：他們都能玩得狠好，踢起球來眞　旣快又準。此外，他們還出版一種名叫『大氣山世界』的刊物；無論攝影，裝訂，印刷或內容，都有非常的成就。</p>
<p>最後，値得我們一提的，華盛頓地方還有一個茄侖特學院，係專供那般聰敏的聾學生作研究高深的學問用的。目前該校共有學生一百六十名。一九三八年，喬斯霍金斯大學曾予一個從小即聾的學生以哲學博士的學位。最近，還有個聾子也在哈佛得到了哲學博士</p>
<p>『聾子也是人」，讓我們牢記住這句話，努力地爲聾子謀取福利吧！</p>
<h3>苜蓿</h3>
<p>— 柷敔</p>
<p>—艾子新解之一—</p>
<p>齊國是個出產不豐寫的地方，加以齊王歡喜作樂，所以人民生活的艱難，是可想而知的了。在齊王的宮裏，有謎語專家淳于髡，踢球專家孫顧，吹竽專家東郭；但在齊王的宮外，是沒有力氣的男人，沒有奶汁的女人，沒有衣穿的小孩</p>
<p>乞丐充滿了整個齊國，齊國彷彿要變成一個乞丐國了。尤其是冬天，氣候是那樣的冷，食糧一點沒有貯蓄，大批貧民就踏着雪挨戶乞討，是一幅多麼悽慘的畫圖啊！</p>
<p>飢餓的人都有憤怒的心，但也只是憤怒而已，誰敢在帝王的鐵一樣可怕的面前發句怨言？憤怒是要表示的，不過要俏皮一些。於是他們尋到在齊王那邊做事的艾子作泄怒的對象，因爲艾子愛俏皮的。</p>
<p>春來了，寒冷已不在人間，田裹零零落落地有些植物長着。</p>
<p>一天，一個衣衫襤褸的老頭子尋到艾子家裏來；艾子是敬老的，連忙迎將出來，看見他手裏捧着一束叫做苜蓿的野草。</p>
<p>「艾大夫」，老人說，「田裏剛生了這件時新食物，老漢不敢先嘗，特來孝敬你老人家。」</p>
<p>「喔——」艾子知道來勢不對，就換了溫和的口氣說，「那要謝謝你了，不過，我嚐了之後，要輪到那一位了，」</p>
<p>「孝敬你老之後，就把它割下給我餓的驢子。」老人說罷就走</p>
<p>艾子呆在門口，心裹想：「洽國是要從根本上着手的。」</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>照相書信</h3>
<p>— 孫思</p>
<p>兵士爲了國家的生存，效命沙塲；但是兵士也是屬於這個社會中的人，所以也得需要人們的幫助，兵士受傷以後，當然有陣地醫院來担負這救死醫傷的責任，就是沒有受傷者亦需要人們的隨時協助－如爲了調劑枯燥緊張的生活，我們應當使兵士們有音樂的娛樂，或圖畫書報的消遣等等……不過這是輕而易舉的而已。如最近英國郵政局最近採用的「照相書信」則可說爲戰士的服務，已至於周密妥善，無微不至</p>
<p>最近赴中東叙利亞等地作戰的英軍，遠涉重洋，如想由平常方法，遵海道寄發一封家信，則不知要隔幾天才能抵達家中。以現在戰爭的變化多端，父母妻子對於遠征者之盼切安危，由這樣迂緩方法的郵遞，眞要令人感到「家書抵萬金」的。所以郵政局即想法用一種規定格式的紙張，爲八吋闊，十一吋長的信紙，由兵士在上面作書。這封信即攝在一張小的底片上，由飛機運往英國。運到英國後的底片，放大顯出，按址送往戰士家中？</p>
<p>據估計，四千張小底片只有一磅重，如其是四千封信則至少要重一百五十磅，那當然是不能用飛機運送，而只得用迂緩的船運了。</p>
<p>爲了以血肉之軀來維護世界正義的戰士，無分中外，都應爲其國家社會所愛戴，因此對於他們而設想的種種便利設施，是戰士應享之權利，也是未上沙塲上的社會各階層應盡的義務。</p>
<h3>無形玻璃</h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>美國女科學家波羅奇博士（Dr,　Katharine</p>
<p>B.　Blodgett）現已發明製造無形玻璃的方法。她用一層百萬分之四吋厚的液體肥皂蓋在玻璃上，因爲玻璃之所以有形，是由於光綫從它表面上反射回來的緣故。現在加了一層肥皂薄膜，就有了兩僩反射。因爲距離配得合適，百萬分之四時厚的肥皂薄膜的反射恰可與玻璃的反射相抵消，所以玻璃的形體也就看不見了。</p>
<p>但這種玻璃傳光力却非常强，差不多百分之九十九的光綫可以透過來。波羅奇博士所發明的道種玻璃可做保護美術展覽會式博物院中名畫之用。此外的用處的有下列數種：汽車前面的玻璃，橱窗，陳列箱，照相機，眼鏡及望遠鏡等。</p>

<p>「旣然這樣，我也不願故意難爲你。」尙老二突然叉改變了笑容說：「戲是一定要學下去的，可是做師傳的總不能不體恤你一些，」那末這樣吧！過一兩天你就依着你老子的話到城裹去念書，說不得我也祇能辛苦一些，跟你一起去；那邊我也有一個朋友，我就在他家裏待着，咱們天天規定一個時候，你從學堂裏出來找我，這樣你的老子跟前就可以瞞過了。」</p>
<p>「可是……梅寳奕然又想到了尙老二要她父親寫的那一張字據。</p>
<p>「這樣你還有什麼說呢？」孟老掌櫃當然總是幫着他大舅子說話的。</p>
<p>「可是那一張紙怎麼樣呢？」梅寳竭力趁着勇氣問。</p>
<p>這一問，倒把孟老掌櫃父子倆連他的兒媳一起問住了，三個人都獃着臉，向尙老二看，大家都明白這一個最重要的關鍵是祇有他自己可以決定的。</p>
<p>可是這件事壓根兒就跟尋常黎園界收徒弟的辦法大不相同，現在更因秋海棠的反對，連一張由父母出面寫的字據也辦不成，這就越發和習慣離得遠了；無論尙老二的腦神經給鴉片煎熬得怎樣的刁巧靈活？一時竟也想不出什麽好的計較來。</p>
<p>「這倒不妨，就是遲一些寫也可以。」他皺緊着兩條又細又淡的三角眉慢慢地說：「眞的，梅寳，你千萬別聽信別人的話，以爲我要你學戲是完全爲了我自己！好在你過一天就要進城了，城裏的人見得總比莊稼人多，不信你自己打聽打聽，看他們怎麽說。」（一八二）</p>

<h3>蘇灘衰敗的原因（上）</h3>
<p>— 錦濤</p>
<p>「寗可同蘇州人相駡，不要和寗波老說話。」蘇州人講話的受人歡迎，原因是音調「和諧。」爲了音調的和諧，唱起戲來，自然更容易悅耳動聽。「曲艷品」上說：「今尙吳歈，－歈是歌曲－以其亮而潤，宛而淸。」的確，蘇州人唱的小調戲劇，音調和諧得像「珠圓玉潤。」只有不忠不孝的吳三桂却不大喜歡它，說它「何音之悽……這大概是武人心情暴躁喜歡大鑼大鼓，特別熱鬧；近於幽雅文靜的玩意兒，不配胃口吧。</p>
<p>蘇州人唱灘簧，起於何時，不可得而考了，根據杭俗遺風：「灘簧以五人分生旦凈丑等脚色，用絃子，琵琶，胡琴，鼓板，所唱亦係戲文，不過另編七字句，每本五六齣－幾塲幾幕的意思－叉有鑼鼓灘簧風行於蘇杭……」它的組織，音樂，和現在無大分別，依據灘字的冠在上面，想來和紹興戲中的秧歌戲－使上海人明白些，可以叫紹興灘簧－一樣。「秧歌」本來是農人在田訴苦，有時又感覺異性的需要，阡陌行人少，隨便嚼嚼（瞎說瞎話的意思）經過許多無名田園文學家的修飾句子，慢慢的形成歌曲。後來覺得很有趣味，趁着農忙過去的月夜或下雨時候，翻轉稻桶，聚集幾個年靑的小夥子，配着簡單的響器絃索，自娛娛人。蘇州人起初唱灘簧，一定也不是職集化，是業餘性質，從事的都是農人，那是一定不會說錯的。不信只要一翻前幾年出版的「蘇灘集」裹面搜羅的材料多數是講農村男女互相愛慕的。</p>
<p>蘇州山明水秀，過去着實出過不少的文人，「文化之邦，」委實當之無愧，因爲文化的發達，農人中也很有幾個會咬文嚼字的。所以蘇灘的詞句，有不少極像崑曲、調子也有很多從崑曲蛻化而來。前一十年，上海遊藝界還沒有像現在的五花八門「滑稽」還不曾獨立，申曲沒有像今日的出風頭，喜慶堂會，多數是唱蘇灘，那時候的蘇灘，是走過相當紅運的。</p>

<h3>America Holds Unprecedented Military Exercises on the Pacific Coast</h3>
<p>Far East Situation Reaches Most Critical Period; Australia Willing to Cooperate Further with Britain and the United States</p>
<p>New York, 10th (Havas) – The United States Army is scheduled to commence unprecedentedly large-scale exercises tomorrow, starting from Fort Lewis in Washington State, along the Pacific coast. The participating forces will number 100,000, including 15,000 motorized troops and artillerymen, along with several hundred mules and horses. The theme of the exercises is "Coastal Invasion Defense." Cavalry units will bear the brunt. Army authorities have warned the shipping industry that Puget Sound is mined and that no ships may approach Fort Walton without permission.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 11th (United Press) – An extraordinary meeting of the Federal Cabinet will be held here today, believed to be due to the tense situation in the Far East. The Australian Prime Minister had originally planned to tour the country, but has now cancelled those plans and decided to return immediately.</p>
<p>Adelaide, Australia, 11th (Reuters) – Australian Prime Minister Menzies has cancelled his planned tour of Australia and decided to return immediately to Melbourne to participate in a full Cabinet meeting. According to him, the situation is developing so rapidly that he cannot delay, which is why he decided to return to the capital. The full Cabinet meeting is scheduled for this afternoon. Minister for the Navy Hughes stated in Melbourne that the situation in the Pacific has deteriorated, but not due to us. We desire peace, but we must also defend our interests. Japan's massing of troops and deployment of warships are not harbingers of peace. We have clearly stated our position, while Japan has not. This is the difference between us and Japan.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 11th (United Press) – Australian Prime Minister Menzies suddenly cancelled his tour of southwestern Australia yesterday and rushed back to Melbourne today to attend the hastily convened Cabinet meeting to deal with the tense situation in the Far East. It is said that due to the seriousness of the situation, the Cabinet's discussion of this matter cannot be delayed, and even the highest-ranking cabinet members do not understand the reason for Menzies' sudden change of plans. However, the best guess from cabinet members is that the Cabinet will hear the results of the important negotiations that Britain and the United States are currently conducting regarding general cooperation in military and economic relations, the future policies of the Allied countries, and greater direct cooperation with the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Sir Stewart stated, regarding Japan, that if Japan advances further and approaches Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, it will be considered a direct threat to British and American interests. Only if Japan pulls back from the brink can accidents be avoided. Menzies issued a statement before today's Cabinet meeting, saying, "The situation in the Pacific is clearly more dangerous than before, but in the past two years, Australia's self-defense capabilities and equipment have improved invisibly." He said, "Although we are clearly facing a serious period, I do not want the Australian public to have any unfounded worries about the state of national defense. Although we still want to maintain peace in the Pacific and do not want to disrupt peace with acts of aggression on our part, we also do not want to evade the fact that Singapore is part of Australia's frontier, as revealed by geography."</p>
<p>Wellington, 11th (Havas) – Acting Prime Minister Nash recently announced that the New Zealand government plans to send a military team to the United States for tank driving training.</p>
<p>U.S. Key Figures Urge Government to Take Action to Sanction Japan</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (United Press) – American congressional leaders and Far East experts advocated last night that if Japan invades Thailand, the United States should take action. These leaders broadcast to the nation from Washington and Chicago, calling for the United States to take a firm stance. Former U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, discussed U.S.-Japan relations in a radio broadcast here. He stated, "We should make it clear to Japan that Japan's aggression, in both the north and south, has now reached its final limit. If it takes further action, it will encounter the combined forces of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Japan's seizure of Thailand will be regarded as the same as Germany's seizure of Dakar. Both are part of a major encirclement of the United States. The United States cannot tolerate either. If Japan abandons its path of building an empire through aggression, then America's friendship with Japan is not severed. Otherwise, we will recognize the seizure of the Philippines." He stated that Japan's government must be overthrown. He also said that if President Roosevelt and his cabinet advocated that the United States should strike Japan now, then he would support declaring war on Japan immediately. However, he believed that America's strength was sufficient to stop Japan without war. Fish declared that he had no affection for Japan because Japan was waging a barbaric war against China, and said that there were very few Americans who were friendly to Japan. He also accused the United States government of following a muddled diplomatic policy of empty threats. Maverick advocated tightening economic sanctions and increasing aid to China. He strongly emphasized that China's war of resistance against Japan had given the United States an opportunity to reorganize its military to resist aggression.</p>
<h3>Cooper Believes Far East Situation Will Have New Developments</h3>
<p>New York, 11th (United Press) – Former Minister of Information Duff Cooper arrived at La Guardia Airport yesterday aboard the Pan American Clipper from Lisbon. He is en route to Singapore to investigate the British war liaison work between Britain and the Far East. When reporting on his work, Cooper said, "The British government believes that there will be new developments in the Far East situation in the near future. Therefore, the British government should establish a more centralized political control mechanism than it has now." He also stated that this work is best coordinated with Singapore. Duff Cooper also stated that the Japanese government's reaction to the harsh measures taken by Britain and the United States for Japan's occupation of southern Vietnam has had a considerable impact on the situation in Asia.</p>
<p>U.S. President to Resolve Major Issues Upon Return to Washington</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (International News Service) – Defense officials announced today that President Roosevelt may return to Washington on Wednesday, and upon his return, he will take decisive action to end the labor dispute at the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey. Contracts for warships and merchant ships worth $460 million cannot be fulfilled due to the strike. Government officials here expect the President to order the Navy to take over the shipyard until normalcy is restored. After returning to Washington, the President will also have to deal with various issues regarding the international situation, such as assisting the Soviet Union without risking war with Japan, increasing cooperation with Germany and France, and responding to Vichy, etc. The three proposals put forward by the government to extend military service, stabilize prices, and increase national defense taxes have caused disputes in Congress. After the President returns to Washington, he may encounter serious opposition.</p>
<p>Washington, 11th (International News Service) – President Roosevelt will probably return to Washington within this week. Rumors of a meeting between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill are still rife. The presidential yacht Potomac sent out a message: "Everything on board is quiet." The yacht is anchored in the fog.</p>
<p>London, 11th (International News Service) – It was learned here yesterday that the Paris Radio Station reported that President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill had a long consultation on the President's yacht Potomac, and that decisions had been made on joint British and American actions in the Far East. The radio station expects that the decisions made by these two major British and American leaders at the meeting will be announced today, including British and American actions against Japan. It is rumored that U.S. Chief of Naval Operations General Marshall and Admiral Stark attended the meeting. It is also rumored that the meeting was held somewhere off the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Actively Training Youth to Prepare for Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Batavia, 11th (United Press) – Australian and indigenous youth in the Dutch East Indies are currently training together with military and other groups to prepare for aggression. Reserve officers of the Indian Army of the Dutch East Indies have been dispatched to various schools to preside over basic semi-military training. The government does not neglect the national ideology of youth groups, and distributes a large number of Dutch national anthem originals with added explanations in school central areas. In addition, patriotic poems such as "The Netherlands will restore glory" are currently circulating widely among the people. The Dutch East Indies Ministry of Education also distributed a small book called "Five Days of the Netherlands" to every school child, describing the facts of the German invasion of the Netherlands on May 10, 1940. From the next semester, a course in Dutch East Indies national defense will be added to the curriculum, with detailed lectures on defense matters. Although the Dutch East Indies authorities know that most residents of the Dutch East Indies have a deep understanding of the war, they still believe that it is necessary to solemnly promote patriotism at this time. The natives here who have received considerable education now have a surprisingly good understanding of the situation in the Far East. However, the Dutch East Indies government hopes that every one of the Dutch Queen's subjects can have a clear understanding of the situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Analyze British Policy Towards Thailand</h3>
<p>British Attitude Changes After Soviet-German War; If Japan Advances Further South, It Will Not Hesitate to Fight</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (United Press) – Apart from the recent statement by Ishii, spokesman for the Cabinet Intelligence Department, that the CDAB is attempting to encircle Japan, the Japanese government has remained silent today regarding the joint warning from Washington and London to Japan not to take rash action towards Thailand. However, some well-informed sources say that since Japan has repeatedly declared a peaceful policy towards Thailand, the government is unlikely to issue any statements. "Kokumin Shimbun" said that the British and American insinuations that Japan is threatening Thailand's independence are "too serious to be ignored." The newspaper demanded that the government "break its silence and smash the inaccurate propaganda of Britain and the United States." "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that if the government remains silent for a long time, the world will think that what Britain and the United States say is true, and will "create disturbing forces in the turbulent East Asia." At that time, people will not realize that the United States is in fact coercing Thailand. "Nichinichi Shimbun" carried news from Bangkok that, according to Chinese sources, Britain had requested Thailand to ban the transport of white rice, rubber, and tin to Japan. It is rumored that Britain also requested Thailand to refuse to cede bases to Japan, expel pro-Japanese officials in Thailand, and terminate Thai-Japanese economic relations, while Britain would promise to return "some" Burmese territory to Thailand as an exchange condition. An "Asahi Shimbun" London reporter stated, "Britain's policy towards Japan until spring was to avoid war in the Far East in order to prolong the European war. However, this attitude of Britain has changed since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. Now, if Japan advances further south, Britain will not hesitate to fight." The reporter believed that the reason for this change in Britain's attitude was that Britain recently had confidence in defeating Germany, believing that any incident in the Far East would not hinder the war in Europe. The news also stated that Britain would rely on the strength of the United States, so Japan must pay attention to the actions of the United States. "Hochi Shimbun" criticized Britain for making military preparations for Thailand, saying that Britain's move was not only to protect Singapore, but also to make various gestures to drag Thailand, which "loves peace," into the anti-Japanese encirclement line of "China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands." At the same time, "Miyako Shimbun" published a special dispatch from San Francisco, stating that six American oil tankers sailed to Australia last week, and the U.S. Navy is currently storing large amounts of oil supplies in Australia. The rumored anti-Japanese encirclement line has taken this action, which is worthy of attention. The newspaper also stated that these oil tankers will meet other giant transports full of military supplies to Rangoon en route, and then sail to Australia together under the protection of warships.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 11th (Reuters) – After two weeks of extreme crisis, Thai cabinet members and diplomats are now concentrating on weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the situation. Thailand's sentiments can be glimpsed from the following prudent criticism in a certain newspaper, which says, "We have indeed experienced adversity, but we have learned who our friends are in times of trouble. Of course, we all know that we have not yet escaped the crisis."</p>
<h3>Thailand Resolves Not to Give Up an Inch of Territory</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 11th (Reuters) – Thai Radio announced last night that the Thai army will not give up an inch of territory, will use all possible methods to annihilate the enemy, and will adopt various tactics, including the most brutal scorched earth tactics. If necessary, Thailand would rather fight to the last person than forfeit its freedom. Any aggressor, even if it succeeds in ravaging Thailand, will find that Thai territory has become the great graveyard of the Thai nation. Finally, the reporter reminded the hypothetical aggressor that Thailand only mobilized a small portion of its troops in the recent conflict on the Vietnamese border. The general audience was surprised by the extremely fierce tone of this startling and solemn warning, and speculated about the immediate causes of this broadcast and the recent changes in the situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Malaya Begin to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Singapore, 11th (United Press) – Japanese residents began to evacuate Malaya yesterday. Fifteen Japanese businessmen have already traveled to Bangkok by train or coastal ship. Japanese sources say that due to the situation caused by the freezing order, 300 Japanese residents in Malaya hope to evacuate. They have requested the Japanese consulate to transport them back to Japan. It is understood that since the freezing order took effect, many Japanese businessmen in Malaya have planned to go to Bangkok and Saigon to set up offices because they cannot continue to operate here. Reliable Japanese sources say that Osaka Shosen Kaisha has not yet ordered its Singapore office to close, but this order may come at any time. It is expected that the Hakone Maru will arrive here from Mumbai in early September and return to Japan. After that, no Japanese ships will sail to Singapore, so the evacuating Japanese residents must travel to Bangkok by train or coastal ship.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Crisis in the South Pacific Intensifies</h3>
<p>The seriousness of the situation in the South Pacific these past few days has increased with time. If we try to review and re-examine the recent progress of various events, we can see that the steps taken by the democracies have been extraordinarily firm, implementing them one after another according to a predetermined plan, with no hesitation whatsoever. They clearly know that everything has reached the final moment, and that the only way is to strike at aggression with force and to gain victory with confidence. Once the time comes, this inevitable and unavoidable great war in the South Pacific may finally erupt.</p>
<p>Speaking of the developments in the Far East events in the past two days, the most exciting thing is that Australia has 600,000 soldiers ready for total mobilization. The Australian government also reported that this number shows that Australia has unified the country's manpower and engaged in military service, war industry, and various aspects of society on a war basis. At the same time, Australian Prime Minister Menzies has cancelled the process of going to various parts of Australia for inspection. The reason is that the situation is developing rapidly and cannot be delayed, and he must immediately return to the capital to participate in yesterday's cabinet meeting to deal with the extraordinary situation. This clearly illustrates that the Far East has reached the stage of preparing to take action; it is even more sufficient to prove that no matter in which direction the adventurers advance, Australia will assist the countries on the same front with all its strength and fight side by side to resist possible aggression.</p>
<p>As for the Philippines, what is shown on the surface is limited to training the people, light control, air raid defense, etc. Its military plans are beyond the knowledge of the general public. But what can be understood at present is that, starting this month, all regular and reserve soldiers of the Philippine Army will be incorporated into the US Army; and the military camps in the Philippines will be taken over by the US military starting on the first of next month. This move not only puts the entire military force of the Philippines under the unified command of the US military, but also shows in fact that the United States is protecting the Philippines with all its strength, making it its outpost in the South Pacific, and not allowing aggressors to make any attempts.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's telegram, the US Army has begun to hold unprecedentedly large-scale exercises on the Pacific coast starting today. The participating troops will number 100,000, and there will be 15,000 motorized troops and artillerymen. The theme of the exercise is "Coastal Invasion Defense." Looking at this exercise by the United States, it at least has a kind of potential profound significance, that is to say, even if the United States Navy has an accident in the Pacific, the domestic coastal defense will not be empty. It has a huge strength to defend. In addition, we should pay more attention to the fact that while the US President was fishing at sea and meeting with Churchill, there was a sudden unprecedented large-scale army exercise in the country. We seem to have to admit that there must be some subtle effects in between.</p>
<p>To sum up the above, the progress of the Far East situation in these two days has truly increased in severity with time. We have the following points of thought from studying the general situation</p>
<p>First, no matter what the military alliance of democracies that Japan has repeatedly spread rumors about, or what the ABCD countries are attempting to "encircle" Japan, as admitted by Ishii, spokesman for the Japanese Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, we should recognize at present that the democracies have the same confidence in resisting aggression and maintaining human civilization. Then, if a great war breaks out in the South Pacific, for the sake of common interests, the ABCD will definitely be consistent in action.</p>
<p>Second, the world is concentrating its attention on Thailand as the fuse for the great war in the South Pacific. In the past, we were unable to pardon Thailand's actions. However, the message that came from Bangkok yesterday was the clear words "We have indeed experienced adversity, but we have learned who our friends are in times of trouble." It is also reported that Thailand has now called on the people to unite against possible aggressors, saying that independence can be lost, but glory must be maintained, and even encouraging the people to burn their towns, grains, forests, and roads and bridges when they have to retreat. These are all sufficient to show that Thailand is in the process of awakening.</p>
<p>Third, although Roosevelt's yacht is still parked in the fog, after more than a week of talks with Churchill, at a minimum, it will make Japan no longer doubt the determination of the democracies. Roosevelt is scheduled to return to the White House within this week, and his actions thereafter will be extremely clear and firm. The world will definitely not have the feeling of "being lost in a five-mile fog."</p>
<p>Fourth, as a reporter from a certain country stationed in London said, Britain was still trying to avoid fighting in the Far East until this spring, but since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, this attitude has undergone drastic changes. If Japan advances further south, Britain will take necessary action without hesitation. We also know that Duff Cooper, the former British Minister of Information, has come to the Far East to sit in town with a special mission from the government, and the active deployment of Britain in Singapore's military aspect goes without saying. Britain's attitude is also beyond doubt.</p>
<p>At a time when the situation is becoming more and more urgent and the crisis is imminent, we hope that adventurers will examine the advantages and disadvantages, measure their virtues and strength, and not act rashly, and that they will have the opportunity to calmly reflect on themselves and save their own calamity.</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie Says Government Determined to Stabilize Legal Tender in Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>Still Supplies Foreign Exchange to Legitimate Merchants; Designates Bank of China to Handle Overseas Chinese Remittances</p>
<p>Chongqing – When Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie received news reporters this afternoon, he stated that the government is determined to stabilize the legal tender in the Shanghai market. He believes that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will be able to implement the government's decision. The funds required have already been allocated to the committee. The members of the committee are Chen Guangfu, Bei Zuyi, Xi Demao, Hall-Patch (UK), and Fox (US). They will start work immediately. Wang also mentioned the impact of the British and American freezing orders, saying that the government has decided to respond as follows: (1) The four banks of the Central Bank of China have received licenses issued by the United Kingdom and the United States and continue to supply foreign exchange to domestic and foreign merchants engaged in legitimate trade as usual. (2) The government is currently negotiating with British and American authorities to designate the Central Bank of China to handle remittances from overseas Chinese and prevent these remittances from falling into Japanese hands. (3) The government has decided to expand the Foreign Exchange Committee subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, and authorize it to handle all matters related to the freeze. The decisions of the committee will be implemented by the Central Bank of China. Wang did not confirm the rumor that 20,000 Chinese troops had been dispatched to the Shan region of Burma, saying that Thailand's attitude seemed to be firmer, largely due to the declarations of the British Foreign Secretary and the US Secretary of State, but he believed that the situation was still uncertain. If Britain and the United States hope to contain Japanese aggression and increase Thailand's resistance, they must provide Thailand with more appropriate assistance in addition to economic means. When asked about Zhang Xueliang's recent situation, Wang replied that although Zhang's sentence had been reduced, the military tribunal ordered the Military Commission to place him under strict surveillance for five years. It has been more than four years now. Wang also said in response to another question that there had been no reports of large-scale conflicts between the Communists and the Central Army in the past two weeks. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing – More than 100 Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in six batches, day and night on the 10th, blindly dropping bombs in various suburbs of the city. More than 20 Chinese were killed or injured, and dozens of houses and shops were destroyed. In addition, there were two fires, which were extinguished by firefighters in a timely manner, resulting in minimal losses. Although the citizens were in a state of alert day and night, they were very calm. Protection and rescue personnel also worked very hard. (10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Japanese planes have been bombing Chongqing for four consecutive days and nights since the morning of August 8th. It is estimated that the Japanese have used a total of 400 planes and dropped nearly 3,000 bombs.

<h3>Guerrilla Warfare in North China: Counteroffensive Against Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A high-ranking Chinese military officer informed me today that Chinese troops have crossed the Yellow River north of Zhengzhou and launched a general guerrilla counteroffensive against Japanese positions, hoping to prevent Japanese forces from withdrawing from their North China positions to reinforce the South Pacific. (United Press report, 3rd)</p>
<h3>President Yu Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Chongqing – An August 3rd Shanghai Allied News Agency dispatch reported rumors that President Yu had issued a letter criticizing certain public figures. A reporter encountered President Yu yesterday and casually mentioned this. President Yu smiled and said that Japan has repeatedly fabricated rumors against us, creating falsehoods out of thin air, intending to confuse the public. It is absurd and laughable, and not worth refuting. (11th)</p>
<h3>Poor Rice Harvest in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, August 11th, United Press – According to domestic Japanese statistics, this year's rice harvest in Japan "will be smaller," but there is no fear of food shortages. It is said that the normal annual production is about 65,800,000 koku, but this year it will be 5% less, due to unfavorable weather in July. Statistics also show an increase in rice production in Korea and Taiwan.</p>
<h3>American Nationals Evacuated from Vietnam Arrive in Manila</h3>
<p>Manila, August 11th, United Press – Fifty-five American nationals evacuated from Saigon arrived here today aboard the French mail ship "Marshal Joffre." They will remain in Manila while awaiting passage back to the United States. It is reported that the Japanese mail ship "Tatsuta Maru," originally scheduled to arrive here on August 22nd, has canceled its Manila voyage.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Battle Situation for One Week (August 1st to 7th)</h3>
<p>Chongqing – One-week battle situation (August 1st to 7th). A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that in the past two weeks, although the Japanese army has undertaken somewhat large-scale actions in western Hubei, they are all the result of the Japanese instigating trouble, and they are bogged down and unable to extricate themselves. Activities of Japanese forces in central Hubei, northern Jiangxi, southern Anhui, and southern Guangdong are not worth mentioning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Western Hubei</p>
<p>Yichang is a salient in the Japanese line, and they deeply feel the threat from surrounding Chinese forces. Therefore, on the 24th of last month, they dispatched a portion of their forces in a rash attempt to reach Fenxiangchang. They were attacked by Chinese field forces, unexpectedly suffering heavy losses and returning defeated. Angered, on the 27th, they gathered the majority of their forces and launched a three-pronged attack. When they reached Wujinshan, Changlinggang, and Faguanquan, they were again fiercely attacked by strong Chinese units, who completely captured the above locations. The Japanese, humiliated and enraged, launched a large-scale reinforcement and simultaneously launched a multi-pronged attack on Chinese forces from Dangyang west, Yichang north, and other locations. Besides the central route, which snuck through Sijieping and Changjialing to Xujiapo, the right route which snuck through Yujia'ao to Biejia Shan, and the left route which snuck through Meizi'ao to Shajiadian, on the 31st, the central route snuck to Zhaojia Yizi, the right route to Guanlinbao, and the left route attacked Jigongshan. By the morning of the first, the Japanese had reinforced each route of the central and right armies to over 8,000 troops, and continued sneaking to Caijiawan, Fenxiangchang, Hengshan, Huangtupo and other places, then attacking Caijiahe and Huanggongshan. The Chinese forces immediately launched a fierce attack, and by the morning of the second, the Chinese forces had completely recovered strongholds such as Huangtupo, Fenxiangchang, Hengshan, and Caijiawan. Except for a portion of the Japanese being surrounded in Huangjiachang, Yangjiawan, and other locations, the majority of the Japanese army retreated along the original route. The Japanese suffered another defeat in this battle, leaving behind more than 1,700 bodies on the battlefield and countless abandoned military supplies. By noon on the 3rd, Chinese pursuing troops had continued to capture places such as Guojiachong and Tianshishan. On this day, in order to struggle, they changed the direction of the left route of more than 5,000 Japanese soldiers, launching a westward attack on the mountainous area west of Wuduhu. One force crossed the southwest from Jiangjunnao, on the morning of the 4th, splitting from Jujihe and Xiaping to forcefully cross and attack Shibanwan and Longwangdong. At the same time, another force attacked Caojia'ao from Erliupo and other places in the north. Chinese forces met them head-on, and fighting has been fierce for several days. At this moment, Chinese and Japanese forces are still fiercely fighting on the line of Baiguoyuan, Longwangdong, and Caojia'ao.</p>
<p>Central Hubei</p>
<p>In the Jingmen and Shayang areas, the Japanese army has gathered more than 5,000 people and launched a four-pronged attack on Haoxue, intending to open up the waterway between Shayang and Yueyang, cut off Chinese transportation on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, and plunder supplies. Because their goal has not been reached, (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Rumors Suggest Both Soviet and Japanese Sides Wish to Maintain Friendly Relations</h3>
<p>Japan is Engaged in the South Pacific and Temporarily Cannot Advance Northward; May Reaffirm Adherence to the Neutrality Treaty</p>
<p>Tokyo, August 11th, Havas – According to reliable sources, both Tokyo and Moscow currently wish to maintain friendly relations and fulfill the Neutrality Treaty. Generally speaking, the Soviet Union is prepared to strengthen and expand the economic concessions that Japan currently holds in the Soviet Far East territories, especially fishing rights and oil extraction rights, and is willing to guarantee to Japan that although the Soviet Union has received aid from the United States, it will not cede its territory as a base to the United States. There is good reason to believe that Japan attaches the utmost importance to this guarantee and is willing to reaffirm the validity of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty, despite the German-Soviet war, as an exchange condition. It is generally expected here that the mechanism of Japanese-Soviet negotiation, which has been disrupted by the German-Soviet war, needs to be adjusted. The Japanese and Soviet governments are likely to demonstrate their amity through the revision of negotiations. According to diplomatic circles here, there are two reasons why Japan wants to maintain a cautious attitude toward the Soviet Union: (1) The progress of the German army in the Soviet Union is not as rapid as certain circles in Japan had expected; (2) Japan hopes to strengthen economic and political ties with Thailand, but the United Kingdom and the United States are determined to resist this and are making various military preparations. The situation is pressing, so the situation in the South Pacific remains tense. Therefore, it would be premature to say that after Japan reached an agreement with France, it has achieved its wishes in the south and is now fully focused on the north. In short, the key to the Far Eastern situation lies in Vietnam, and especially Thailand. Although Japan can continue to make preparations on the border between Manchuria and Siberia in case of emergencies, it can be safely asserted that if there are no unexpected changes in the situation, there will be no major developments in the north for the time being.</p>
<h3>Japan Requests Expansion of Government Structure</h3>
<p>Tokyo, August 11th, United Press – Japanese newspapers stated today that because the Japanese cabinet is currently facing a "critical" situation, it is still insufficient even though it is doing its utmost to deal with this new international situation. Therefore, government circles are requesting an expansion of the government structure. It is reported that the government will appoint a separate Minister of Commerce and a Minister of Railways, as these two positions are currently concurrently held by Foreign Minister Toyota and Communications Minister Murata.</p>
<h3>Wakasugi Discusses US-Japan Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, August 11th, Reuters – Asahi Shimbun carried a conversation by long-distance telephone across the Pacific Ocean by Japanese Minister to the United States Wakasugi, saying that the United States seemed to have formulated practical procedures to confront Japan, or any possible steps that might be taken. Although the United States may have a desire to maintain friendly relations, Washington seems prepared to deal with any serious escalation of the current situation with determination and agility. He does not believe that the United States will necessarily take proactive action, as the rapid changes in international developments make it a serious mistake to compare today's United States with last year's. The newspaper also asked about the United States' attitude towards the Far East. He replied that Washington's concerns were based on the assumption that Japan, with the help of Germany, is now imitating Nazi actions in the Far East. At the same time, stimulated by this concern, measures to counter them are being drafted. He said that the United States' attitude towards Thailand is extremely delicate. He had originally planned to return home, but due to the current shortage of ships, he is temporarily unable to do so.</p>
<h3>Rogers Appointed Economic Advisor to Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, August 11th, Reuters – Hong Kong is facing various problems after freezing the funds of Chinese and Japanese people and joining the Sterling Area. Therefore, Rogers has now been appointed as the economic advisor to the Hong Kong government. British Financial Commissioner for the Far East Holberton has gone to Chongqing and is temporarily serving as the British commissioner of a certain gold foreign exchange equalization fund.</p>
<h3>Over One Thousand Red Army Officers and Soldiers Decorated for Meritorious Service</h3>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, TASS – 1,207 Red Army generals and soldiers have been awarded medals by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for their bravery, courage, and meritorious service in fighting the enemy. Among them, 31 people were awarded the Order of Lenin and 444 were awarded the Order of the Red Banner.</p>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, TASS – Three Red Army commanders, Army Captain Badarov, Adjutant Kemensichekov, and Junior Adjutant Lidni, have achieved outstanding results in battle and have been awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Not Freeze Funds of Japanese Officials in the United States</h3>
<p>Tokyo, August 11th, United Press – The U.S. Embassy notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance yesterday that the United States is prepared to unfreeze the funds of Japanese officials in the United States, provided that American officials in Japan also receive reciprocal treatment. Japan has already relaxed its position on British funds in the same way and is believed to be accepting the U.S. proposal.</p>

<h3>Eighth Week of Soviet-German Struggle: Fierce Battles Unfold in the Central and Southern Regions</h3>
<p>Red Army Strengthens Defenses in Three War Zones</p>
<p>The United States Believes Germany Cannot Achieve Its Goals</p>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, United Press – It was reported yesterday that the Soviet Red Army has checked the recent German offensive and launched several counteroffensives, while strengthening the defenses of the Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv war zones. Official reports claim that the 307th Brigade of the German 163rd Division was almost completely annihilated. This brigade was transferred from Narvik in Norway to the Finnish front. Information obtained by Moscow from all regions of the 1,800-mile front indicates that the German army has failed to achieve its three major objectives: Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv, showing that the blitzkrieg against the Red Army has failed. It is reported that war is unfolding around Korosten, 85 miles northwest of Kyiv, around Smolensk, and around Bila Tserkva, 45 miles south of Kyiv. According to reports, Red Army units continue to repel German offensives in Smolensk, Korosten, Bila Tserkva, and the western Estonian war zone. At the same time, Soviet guerrillas are disrupting and harassing Nazi rear transportation and troops moving to the front lines.</p>
<p>Vichy, August 11th, United Press – Paris's 午報 (Mornign News) yesterday published information from Ankara stating that the Soviet People's Committee, chaired by Stalin, has appointed six new generals to command Soviet troops against Germany. The newspaper claimed that the committee dismissed Marshal Timoshenko from his command of the central and western regions after a bitter debate, and his vacant position may be filled by Marshal Budyonny.</p>
<p>Washington, August 11th, United Press – Military and diplomatic observers here watched yesterday as the German-Soviet war entered its eighth week, saying that no matter what the outcome of the war, the Nazis have suffered serious material and psychological setbacks, which will have a major impact on Hitler's future. These experts said that Germany's estimations have been greatly frustrated by the strong resistance of the Soviet Union's impressive war machine. Although German advances have been somewhat successful in the past few days, Hitler has not been able to achieve a major objective in Soviet territory. Even if Soviet resistance collapses in a few weeks and German troops occupy most of the European part of the Soviet Union, Germany will not be able to achieve one of its main goals: obtaining the rich grain supplies of Ukraine to feed Germany and the occupied areas this winter. According to sources here, Soviet resistance has prompted collective farmers to seize what they can. All of these factors have greatly reduced the German threat to invade England, while England also has the strength to launch large-scale air raids on German industrial and military targets, causing at least some damage. Recently, the Red Army's air force has also been trying to break through Goering's so-called impregnable air defense line.</p>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, TASS – The Red Army led by Lukyanov yesterday defeated two battalions of infantry and one battalion of motorized infantry of the German 312th Infantry Regiment. 400 German soldiers were killed, countless were wounded, and 219 were captured. Red Army hand grenade throwers displayed their power, destroying 23 enemy tanks and 8 artillery pieces. Previously, German troops, led by tanks, attacked the right wing of the Red Army. The Red Army remained unusually calm, deliberately allowing the tanks to break through, and then launching a surprise attack, cutting off the German tanks from the German infantry and annihilating them individually.</p>
<p>German Troops in Southern Ukraine Eager to Seize Odesa</p>
<p>Berlin, August 11th, Sea News Agency – This afternoon's German war report stated that in southern Ukraine, German troops are bravely pursuing the retreating enemy army, making rapid progress. The actions of German troops elsewhere on the Eastern European battlefield are proceeding according to plan. Last night, German bomber groups heavily bombed Moscow airfields, dropping many tons of bombs and incendiary bombs. The northwest and eastern parts of the city were particularly heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Berlin, August 11th, United Press – A Nazi spokesman said yesterday that he expected Odesa and Mykolaiv, the Soviet naval base 70 miles northeast of it, to be occupied by German troops, who are currently invading Ukraine, through a three-pronged attack. German troops, who have been engaged in the Soviet war for eight weeks, are reported to be entering this Soviet "breadbasket," which stretches 45 miles long from Smolensk to the Black Sea, after defeating more than 500,000 Soviet troops from three divisions. The German High Command's Sunday communique, while only saying that the war continues according to plan, stated that German troops had shot down 10,000 Soviet aircraft in seven weeks. It also stated that the Red Army's losses, including deaths, injuries, and captures, total nearly five million people. Although the communique boasted of victory, it ultimately had to acknowledge the effectiveness of Soviet resistance, as it stated that German troops would deal ruthlessly with any Soviet civilians, regardless of age or gender, who engaged in guerrilla warfare or sabotage. The Nazi spokesman's remarks indicated that Odesa and Mykolaiv are what the Germans currently want to obtain, and are more urgent than Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. It is reported that Kyiv is surrounded on all sides after the fall of Korosten, a transportation hub 85 miles northwest of it. The German side also claimed that the destruction of the troops led by Marshal Budyonny in the "pocket" 130 miles south of Kyiv is making the fall of Odesa more imminent, as the position of this "pocket" is appropriate to be on the way to Odesa, and at the same time, the encirclement of Kyiv will inevitably be tightened.</p>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, United Press – The Soviet High Command admitted this morning that strong German forces were approaching Leningrad and had penetrated deeply into Ukraine, reaching the vicinity of Uman, an important transportation center. The statement said that the northern Red Army had stubbornly resisted German forces in the Soltsy area, 120 miles south of Leningrad.</p>
<h3>Rumors Say Britain Plans to Transport Troops to the Caucasus via Iran</h3>
<p>Military Authorities Have Already Drafted Plans to Send Indian Troops to Land in the Persian Gulf</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, August 10th, Havas – The "Basler Nachrichten" stated that British military authorities have drafted a plan to transport troops to the Soviet Caucasus via Iran. The plan stipulates that Indian troops will be dispatched to land at the port of Bandar Shahpur in the Persian Gulf, and then transported by rail to a port on the Caspian Sea coast, and then to the Soviet port of Baku. At the same time, British troops in Iraq and Syria can also be transported to the Caucasus via this route. According to the Swedish "Social-Demokraten", British troops are now on standby.</p>
<h3>Fourteenth Attack on Moscow</h3>
<p>Ten German Aircraft Shot Down; A Giant Bomb in the Kremlin</p>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, United Press – Officials announced that the German air force attacked Moscow yesterday morning, the fourteenth time in nineteen nights. Only a few aircraft broke through the capital's air defense line. Nine German aircraft were shot down before reaching the Soviet capital, and several braved the night fighters, anti-aircraft balloons, and anti-aircraft fire to reach Moscow, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs. Residential buildings caught fire, and there were slight casualties among civilians. The air raid alarm lasted for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Moscow, August 11th, TASS – On the 9th, our air force shot down 45 enemy aircraft, and we also lost 25. On the 10th, enemy aircraft attacked Moscow and ten were shot down (the previous report of eight was incorrect). On the 9th, our air force shot down five enemy reconnaissance planes in Moscow.</p>
<p>Berlin, August 11th, Sea News Agency – German officials announced last night that, according to reports received here yesterday, the German air raid on Moscow on August 9th was the most violent and successful air raid by the German air force. One hundred German bombers participated in the air raid, dropping five types of powerful explosive bombs and thousands of incendiary bombs. A giant bomb hit the Kremlin in Moscow, causing heavy damage. Several fires broke out near the Kremlin and soon spread. Fires also broke out in the southeastern part of the city, and several oil pools were burned. A large factory also caught fire.</p>
<h3>If Vichy Yields Further, the United States Will Break Off Relations with France</h3>
<p>Nazis Demand Bases in West Africa; British and American Authorities Closely Monitor</p>
<p>New York, August 11th, Reuters – According to sources here, Washington is closely monitoring the meeting of French officials in Vichy to determine what is being discussed, which is likely to be a demand from Germany similar to the complete use of key bases along the Atlantic coast of French Africa. If Vichy agrees to this demand, the United States will immediately break off diplomatic relations with Vichy. The entire issue of French territories in the Western Hemisphere has become a matter of serious study for Washington due to recent developments in Vichy. It is reported that President Roosevelt and Washington officials are paying close attention to this matter. It is widely believed that this issue is now being actively discussed by British and American authorities. According to opinions in Washington, Germany's current demands on Vichy are only part of a far-reaching plan by the Nazi side, as Germany wants to obtain new and important bases to strengthen its air and submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping this winter.</p>
<p>London, August 11th, Reuters – A Washington dispatch from the Observer said that the American people are completely disgusted with Vichy's concessions to Germany and Japan, and advocate that the United States should launch an attack to seize Dakar in a timely manner to prevent Germany from preempting it. However, the State Department believes that as long as the hope of keeping Vichy neutral is not extinguished, the United States will not break off relations with it. In practice, the US government is currently trying to win over General Weygand, while only occasionally dealing with Vichy. It is still doubtful what General Weygand's attitude is. From the perspective of the Allied countries, if Weygand continues to stand pat in French North Africa, everything will be fine, and the State Department will continue to allow supplies such as sugar and tea to be shipped to North Africa. But if Weygand joins the Axis or Vichy forces him to abandon his neutral policy, American supplies will naturally be cut off. Vichy is well aware of this situation. This is the psychological offensive currently maintained by Britain and the United States, and the results of its adoption are now gradually being recognized as encouraging.</p>
<p>London, August 11th, United Press – The Daily Telegraph reported yesterday that Nazi Germany's demands that Vichy grant "facilities" in Bizerte, Dakar, Algiers, and Casablanca as the price of Franco-German cooperation. Bizerte is only 130 miles from the naval base and port of Trapani in western Sicily, and the current route for German and Italian reinforcements to Libya is from Catania to Tripoli, the distance of which is provided. In addition to shortening the distance of Axis shipping to Africa, the occupation of Bizerte will give Germany a base that is not easily accessible to British bombers. The occupation of Bizerte will open the door to Tunisia for the Axis powers, and the operations of the German Africa Corps from Libya to French North Africa will be extended. It is estimated that the German African army has a total of 17 divisions. It is widely believed that if Vichy succumbs, most of it will be "for the more direct interest of the United States in maintaining French sovereignty over Atlantic seaports such as Dakar." Recalling the United States' warning to Vichy that cooperation with Germany exceeds the scope of the armistice treaty, this attitude is half due to the United States' fear that Germany will seize Dakar.</p>
<p>French Officials Busy Meeting Under Tense Atmosphere</p>
<p>London, August 11th, Reuters – Vichy cabinet members have repeatedly gathered for meetings, and a tense atmosphere fills the air. According to German wireless news, former French Foreign Minister Flandin, who has always advised Marshal Pétain to cooperate with Germany, is now the last French official to arrive in Vichy. German wireless also said that according to rumors in Vichy, Darlan will be appointed as Admiral of the French Navy for his outstanding achievements, and will also hold the rank of General of the Army, so as to have greater power over military affairs. A Berlin dispatch from the Swedish Democraten stated that political circles in Berlin believe that the discussions at Vichy this weekend, in addition to the political relations between France and the three Axis powers, also involve military cooperation, such as using German assistance to defend French colonies. Darlan is said to have expressed his willingness, but Pétain is still hesitant. It is rumored that Weygand shares the same views as Pétain. Darlan is aware that this agreement means breaking off relations with the United States, but is willing to accept the consequences. Berliners also believe that Vichy's next step will be to join the Tripartite Pact, and the armistice agreement will be revoked and replaced by a peace agreement. The dispatch went on to say that Berlin is now actively studying the United States' intentions towards West Africa and expects the United States to take action soon. The Vichy News Agency stated that a cabinet meeting will be held on Monday, but what will be discussed remains a secret. It is only known that the scope of the talks includes the entire issue of domestic and foreign affairs. The Vichy News Agency also released another message, saying that the discussions among Vichy officials on Saturday and Sunday focused on political issues. Recently, newspapers in the occupied area have argued that if a new impetus is given to general policy, especially foreign policy, it is necessary to completely reorganize the government. In short, in any aspect, domestic and foreign affairs seem to be closely linked, and the events of Saturday's meeting will be studied under these two aspects. The attitude of Justice Minister Barthelemy during the exchange of views is still very noteworthy. It is rumored that the report on judicial matters and the implementation of the armistice conditions was written by him.</p>
<p>Vichy, August 11th, United Press – Although officials say that the cabinet will not hold a cabinet meeting until today at the earliest, cabinet members held an informal meeting at 5 pm yesterday after Marshal Pétain and General Weygand returned from watching the horse race. This was not a full cabinet meeting, but most cabinet members continued negotiations with General Weygand in parks and hotels, which had begun on Saturday. While watching the horse race, Ambassador Scapini, the French representative for prisoners of war in Berlin, approached him for a meeting. He has just returned here directly from Berlin. It is widely believed that he is discussing further prisoner releases with German authorities.</p>
<h3>Slavic People's Congress Held in Moscow</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th – The Slavic People's Congress was held in Moscow on Sunday afternoon. Representatives from Poland, Czechia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Montenegro attended and delivered speeches. The famous Soviet writer Alexei Tolstoy gave the opening address, stating that Slavs worldwide must unite to swiftly destroy the German Fascist Party. Although divided into different groups, Slavs are now united and equal. Slavs will inevitably obstruct, destroy, and annihilate Fascist war institutions everywhere. A certain Polish general, speaking in Polish, said that Poland's resistance and sacrifice had hindered enemy plans. The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was the beginning of German Fascism's self-destruction. The treaty concluded with the Soviet Union by the Polish government led by Sikorski demonstrated its political wisdom. The Polish people are determined to support his work. Their task is to implement this treaty immediately. Now is not the time for doubt; we must do our best to defeat Hitler. Poland is now forming an army to fight alongside the Red Army, and its troop strength will soon be full. However, all Poles must fight, even those in the rear, must use their wisdom to deal with cunning and brutal enemies. The thousand-year-old feud of the Slavs being massacred will now be avenged. We must fight for a better world. German Fascism is not only the enemy of Slavs, French, and British people, but also wants to create a despicable world of violence and enslavement of others.</p>
<h3>British Destroyer Sunk</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th – The British destroyer "Hyacinth," which once belonged to the British fleet stationed in China about three years ago, has recently sunk. The details are unknown. A naval communiqué stated: "The Admiralty regrets to announce that the 'Hyacinth' has sunk. There were no casualties among the crew." This ship displaced 1,375 tons, and its main armament was four 4.7-inch guns.</p>

<h3>Liaison Officer of the Democratic Front</h3>
<p>However, Hopkins disregarded others' contempt and tried to develop whenever he had the opportunity. His scope of activity gradually expanded from social undertakings to other aspects. By 1934, he had already aroused people's discrimination. Some Republicans even opposed him, saying that with 3.5 million people already on the relief list, he could be said to be the largest "employer" in the country.</p>
<p>In January 1939, Roosevelt nominated him as Secretary of Commerce. The Senate's approval was quite tortuous because everyone felt that such a person with an unknown background suddenly becoming such a high-ranking official was somewhat inappropriate. In the President's view, he wanted to use the position of Secretary to give him a vice-presidential candidate qualification. Furthermore, Hopkins was weak and ill, and giving him a more superior position would help him recuperate. As Hopkins' position rose higher and higher, he had more and more political enemies, such as Tugwell and Secretary of the Interior Ickes, who attacked him the most vigorously.</p>
<p>In May 1940, the European War took a sharp turn for the worse, and the signs of France's collapse were already visible. At this time, the White House was filled with telegrams and correspondence, and official duties were a hundred times more burdensome. Hopkins was invited to stay at the White House so that he could be by the President's side day and night. He conveyed matters very quickly, had well-informed news, and responded fluently. During the most tense international situation, he rose early and slept late, without showing any fatigue for two weeks. The President never knew that his best friend was so capable and valued him even more.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's personal and official friendship with Hopkins was extraordinary. When New Deal radicals spoke ill of him to the President, the President never expressed his opinion but secretly took care of Hopkins. When Hopkins was struggling with poverty and illness, the President generously hired a private doctor to treat him, showing meticulous care.</p>
<p>The First Lady, Mrs. Roosevelt, was also very interested in social undertakings and often made suggestions to Hopkins. He naturally attached great importance to the First Lady's wishes. The First Lady also treated him with the utmost respect. When Mrs. Hopkins passed away in 1937, the President and his cabinet members personally attended the funeral, and the First Lady even took the motherless young daughter, Diana, to the White House to raise her, loving her as her own for three years.</p>
<p>In August 1940, the President wrote to Hopkins, approving his resignation as Secretary of Commerce, and the wording was at least twenty times more sincere than the standard approval letter given to other cabinet members. The President's letter said: "You may resign from your current position, but only in terms of your official position, not in other respects. Our friendship will remain as it was in the past."</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1940, Roosevelt ran for re-election, and Hopkins did his best to preside over the election campaign on behalf of Farley. He first represented the President in Chicago, attended the Democratic National Convention, and arranged everything. After that, he followed the President to give speeches in New York and Boston. As a result, he achieved unprecedented success. At this point, the President's favor towards him increased even further.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, after the election, the President took his old friend on a yacht to tour the Caribbean Sea to relax. At this time, the President revealed the "Democratic Nation Aid Act" that he had planned in his heart.</p>
<p>As for the fact that the President sent him as a special envoy in January of this year, it was something he never dreamed of. Two weeks before this happened, the President joked with him, saying: "Harry (Hopkins' nickname), what do you think it would be like to be hit by a bomb? Have you ever thought about traveling by plane? I heard that those air-raid shelters are very crowded." Hopkins replied with jokes as usual. He thought the President was just joking with him casually and that there would be nothing serious, but he did not know that the President had already made up his mind and deliberately kept it a secret.</p>
<p>On January 3, 1941, the President unexpectedly announced at a news conference that he had appointed Hopkins as a special envoy to Great Britain as his personal representative. Afterwards, the President's press secretary, O'Leary, told Hopkins about this.</p>
<p>"Just think about it for me!" He said to O'Leary involuntarily. "Just think for a minute. I am a person who engages in social undertakings. My father is a cobbler, and my mother is an elementary school teacher. Now I am going to meet with British Prime Minister Churchill and the British government officials. It really makes my head spin." Later, Special Envoy Hopkins arrived in Great Britain and met with more than 300 leaders from all walks of life in Great Britain. He and Prime Minister Churchill became friends at first sight.</p>
<p>Roosevelt sent him as a special envoy to take on important work in completing the national defense and aid to the Democratic Front plan after he returned home. Before departing, Hopkins was already very familiar with the various needs of Great Britain and knew more details than any other American. Recalling that before the United States joined the European War, President Wilson also sent political advisor Colonel House to Europe as an envoy, and as a result, he issued a joint declaration with British Foreign Secretary Grey. As for the result of Hopkins' trip, it was predictable before he departed.</p>
<p>Hopkins openly expressed to his friends in the White House that he did not love high office or great wealth. His most important responsibility now is to preside over the implementation of the Democratic Front Aid Act. Most of his work is done in the Lincoln Bedroom on the second floor of the White House. He often answers the phone in the room for hours. Such a job is a great excitement for such a person who does not love vanity and is not greedy for money. Whenever this boy from Iowa stole a moment to rest, he thought that he was witnessing the evolution of history, and that he himself was contributing to this great era of transformation. (The End)</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Throws Out Huge Amounts of US Dollars</h3>
<p>Market Tightens Twice, but British and American Rates Finally Level Out</p>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Fluctuations in the black market for British and American exchange rates have lessened, and the market tightened twice during the day before finally leveling out. After opening on a loose note in the morning, importers came in to buy aggressively. HSBC was only willing to supply US dollars at HK$4.75 at the small counter, so the market softened. British gold at 2 pence 859375 was also difficult to settle. Hong Kong sent a huge amount to sell off (the total sales were US$600,000 for the day, reportedly to maintain the black market on behalf of the Exchange Fund). The US dollar then depreciated to HK$4.8125. At noon, there was news of a peaceful atmosphere between England and Germany, and HSBC absorbed the supply, returning the market to a flat position. In the afternoon, foreign British and American firms and import firms continued to have good appetites, but even more Hong Kong telegram sales poured in. The market quickly tightened and then flattened out, with both exchange rates ending up the same as the closing price on Saturday. Trading was quite active throughout the day, with minor buying and selling by Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Importers Rush to Settle</p>
<p>Since the morning, there was no market for silver prices from foreign telegrams. The exchange rate of various countries, British to Shanghai, decreased by 125, calculated as 3 pence 0625, the rest were flat. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening bank selling price for spot British gold was 2 pence 859375, and US dollars were HK$4.8125, which was 015625 higher for British gold and 03125 higher for US dollars than the afternoon closing price on Saturday. Foreign banks were willing to supply at slightly higher prices, and the situation was very firm. After 9:20 a.m., importers suddenly rushed to settle, and foreign banks such as HSBC were less willing to supply, and the market was seen to be softening. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was still levied at 24.25%. After HSBC listed US dollars at HK$4.75 at the small counter, speculators mostly waited and watched, while importers aggressively bought August US dollars at HK$4.75. HSBC released a small amount of supply, and American banks also supplied at slightly higher prices. Telegrams from Hong Kong came to sell August at HK$4.8125, and banks were willing to supply at slightly higher prices, and the tightness immediately began to loosen. Until noon, HSBC repeatedly absorbed August US dollars at HK$4.8125, and the tightening trend rose again. The noon closing price softened to 2 pence 84375 for British gold and HK$4.78125 for US dollars.</p>
<p>Speculators' Buying and Selling Uneven</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Chinese merchants and speculators' buying and selling were uneven. They first sold August at HK$4.8125, and then bought at HK$4.78125. HSBC and American banks and importers absorbed the supply at the slightly higher prices. The supply was all from Hong Kong telegrams, so the market softened to HK$4.75 and returned to a flat position. At the 3:30 p.m. closing, the spot to September futures were all 2 pence 84375 for British gold and HK$4.78125 for US dollars, which was the same as the afternoon closing price on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Cash Gold Has Risen Significantly, So Shift to Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold market fluctuated drastically, which was unexpected. It started to fall, then suddenly soared, and finally retreated slightly. The people's determination to be firm has turned flat due to the foreign exchange not being tight. Since the morning, importers were buying US dollars, and HSBC only supplied at the small counter price of HK$4.75, and it suddenly turned tight from loose, so the securities firms sold small amounts to HK$7,065. Soon, Litetai reversed to buy aggressively, going long 5,000 taels. Chengyi covered shorts and Yida reversed to buy, each going long about 3,000 taels. Under the rush to buy from remittance merchants and retail investors, the soaring trend broke out again, and the Western Shanghai gang sold at the HK$7,200 mark, slightly suppressing it. At the noon close, there was a peaceful atmosphere between England and Germany, and it rose sharply again. After the noon close, it broke through HK$7,200 and soared to an unprecedented peak of HK$7,275 in the chaotic buying frenzy. However, the foreign exchange was still flat, and remittance merchants Sinfengyong sold 5,000 taels, and securities firms also sold, so a counter-current decline began. Finally, it rose again by HK$87 to HK$7,220, and the August US dollar closed at HK$4.78125, which was HK$7,283, a squeeze of HK$63. After the close, it fell to HK$7,175, and finally HK$7,190. A total of 160,000 to 170,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The rise in cash has stopped and retreated slightly. Shihan sold Jin Yuan 20 taels at a price of HK$8,860, and Taikangrun sold Mingfeng 10 taels at HK$8,850. In the afternoon, Hongqingyong sold Xinyuan 20 taels at HK$8,860, Shunyuan sold Decheng 20 taels at HK$8,870, and then sold Xinyuan 30 taels at a price of HK$8,860, and then sold Jin Yuan 30 taels at HK$8,850, a small squeeze of HK$30. Jewelry gold was still HK$910.</p>
<p>Futures Rise Again by HK$87</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels), initially due to the loose foreign exchange, the market was weak. The opening at 9:15 a.m. was HK$7,080, which was HK$53 lower than the noon closing price on Saturday. It soon rose to HK$7,100, but was sharply reduced to HK$7,065 due to the aggressive selling from Yida and Defu. Unexpectedly, Litetai suddenly reversed to buy aggressively, and Sinfengyong and Yifeng also competed to buy at the low. When it was heard that the foreign exchange was reported at HK$4.8125, making it difficult to settle US dollars, the buying frenzy expanded. Chengyi, Dingsheng, and Yida aggressively bought, and the price soared by HK$135, reaching the HK$7,200 mark, which was suppressed by the selling of Yiyuan Defu and limit-price sellers. It fell by HK$60, retreating to HK$7,140. Only five minutes away from noon closing, the US dollar was reported tight, and buyers rose up one after another. Litetai, Yida, Chengyi, Jinyuan, Lianxing, and Hesheng all bought in a frenzy of HK$40. The noon closing was HK$7,180. After the close, Chengyi and Defu bought again, rising to HK$7,230. The sentiment was very good. The afternoon opened at 2 o'clock, continuing to rise to HK$7,250, a high opening of HK$70. Then, it rose to HK$7,260 in the chaos, and then retreated back to HK$7,230, which was the large-scale selling by remittance merchant Sinfengyong. Ruo saw Yida, Dafeng, and Gonghe aggressively buying, in a frenzy of HK$45, rising to HK$7,275. However, the foreign exchange was still flat, and US dollars at HK$4.78125 were still available to settle. The market softened, and Yida sold again, Dingsheng, Sinfengyong, and Defu competed to sell, and floating longs rose up to sell, and it immediately retreated sharply to the HK$7,200 mark. It was then aggressively bought by retail investors, raising it to HK$7,240. The 3:30 p.m. closing was HK$7,220, which was a sharp increase of HK$87 compared to the price on Saturday. It was found that it had been rising for six consecutive days, with a total increase of HK$539. After the close, the selling frenzy rose again, squeezing it down to HK$7,190. The difference on the day was HK$210. The selling price of gold bars at the gold shop was HK$8,900, and the buying was reduced by HK$200. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Shops Have Not Changed</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at the silver shops, Datongxing and Xintongxing, is still listed at HK$910 and has not changed, with the buying price reduced by HK$40, it is said.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes Are High in Both Spot and Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable cash prices, so although gold futures trended up, British and American gold pounds did not fluctuate much. British gold notes remained the same, with market prices holding steady. US dollar notes opened at HK$2,034. After the opening, Dale and others sold, falling back to HK$30. United, Zhenhe, Tongxing, Dagong, Zhichengxiang, Yuanyong, and others competed to buy, raising it to HK$58. Xiangxing sold, falling back to HK$45. In the afternoon, it was as high as HK$56. The afternoon opened immediately as high as HK$72. Then Zhicheng and Shunyuan came in to buy, rising to HK$78. United, Tongxing, Xiangyuanyong, Yingtai, and others sold, falling back to HK$64. Tongli and Zhongxing rose up to search and buy, and the closing price was raised to HK$2,070, which was squeezed up by HK$28 compared to last week. A total of HK$1.6 million was traded throughout the day. Spot prices rose to HK$21.10. Hong Kong notes tended to be stable, and market prices held steady. Japanese gold notes fell and then returned to a flat position, with the evening market also standing at the original price of HK$2.30. Korean notes tended to be weak, falling to HK$1.82 in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Securities: Differing Conclusions for Bulls and Bears, Uneven Domestic Bonds</h3>
<p>Rubber Stocks Are Particularly Colorful</p>
<p>The private bond market saw continued fluctuations, as differing conclusions from both sides led to different levels for each bond. Market sentiment was indifferent. Bulls were still holding firm, and the bears remain in the minority. Observing the environment, there was no reason or basis to be bullish, but it was still too early to be bearish, so the market situation was uncertain. Without new stimulus to the environment, dramatic changes are unlikely. In the morning, Shuntai and Jiufeng bought, Tongkang entered Class C and exited Class E, but the exits were more than the entries. Yitai and Shengda exited Class C, Lianhe exited Class A, and Xinhua sold all except Class D. The market went from high to low, indicating that the bulls were still on the table. In the afternoon, Lianhe re-entered Class A, and No. 41 also received Class A. Yongchang and Runli received Class B and C, Gongmao received Class E, Lianhe and Lianyi exited Class A, B, and C, and Hongda exited Class C, which was surging. Market sentiment was lax, and the market resulted in highs and lows five times. Except for Class D, which was not opened, the rest saw mixed gains and losses of 1-2 corners. The total number of transactions was less than HK$1.3 million. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 60 shares of Bank of Communications were traded at a price of HK$89 each.</p>
<p>The public company stock market opened actively, with rubber stocks being particularly colorful. After opening, prices rose steadily. Chen's stock had the most transactions, rising linearly from the opening price of HK$1 to HK$1.31. Garentan also rose from HK$0.87 to HK$1.06, closing at HK$1.02.</p>
<h3>Food: After the Hurricane, More Than 60,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Initially Think of Raising Prices but Ultimately Know It Is Difficult</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice arrive in Shanghai. The four boats were delayed due to the hurricane a few days ago, and yesterday, four boats arrived on the same day. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou arrived in the morning, with 12,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The Nanning also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, with 23,000 bags of Yangon small-grained rice from Hong Kong, temporarily docked at Pudong, and will be moved to the Puxi wharf within a few days. The Hunan also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, with 18,437 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docked at the Bund wharf of the company within the French Concession for unloading. The Chongqing arrived in the afternoon, with only 272 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. However, the amount of foreign rice transferred to North China was very large, with 3,836 bags shipped to Qingdao, 793 bags to Yantai, and another 3,038 bags of flour. There were 9,258 bags shipped to Tianjin, which will be transported by the original ship tomorrow. The Anshun arrived on Saturday evening, with 828 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday), with 7,655 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The above six boats transported a total of 62,196 bags of foreign rice, of which the Yuezhou and Yusheng were Bureau of Works price rice, and the rest were cargo for customers. (Zu)</p>
<p>The foreign rice market initially stabilized yesterday, but then weakened, and prices fluctuated by one or two yuan. In the early market, business was slightly better as the street was sunny on Monday, and speculators such as the "ball gangs" were also very interested in hoarding. The selling prices of various foreign rice saw a slight increase of three to five corners to more than one yuan. However, the actual sales did not continue after the price was high, and the situation was eased and the orders were smooth. Outside guests were not interested in adding to their hoards, and generally floating households and retail investors sought to sell for profit. The selling atmosphere in the market was strong, and the selling prices of various rice stood and then fell. The early morning price of small-grain rice was as high as 125.1 yuan, but then returned to a low of 124.5 yuan, 4 yuan, 3 yuan, and the closing price was only 122.5 yuan. Yinghuasi small-grained rice was 152 yuan, falling from 151.5 yuan to 151 yuan. The early morning price of No. 2 Siamese rice was 144 yuan, followed by 143.5 yuan, 3 yuan, to 142.5 yuan. The price of broken rice once opened at 110 yuan, and later 109 yuan also lacked buyers. The results were generally similar to the closing price on Saturday, and some were even slightly lower. The trading volume of spot rice was about 10,000 bags. Yinghuasi also had only 400-500 tons. If the early opening price of No. 1 Saigon high-quality rice was 136-137 yuan, then it was only 134-135 yuan, the mid-range price was 133 yuan, No. 3 was 125 yuan, special Siamese rice was 144.5 yuan, No. 1 Siamese rice was 132-133 yuan, No. 2 was 122.5 yuan, 122 yuan, and then 121 yuan. The price of Min Dang high-quality rice was 138.5 yuan, 136 yuan, the mid-range price was 132 yuan, 130 yuan, and then 116-117 yuan. Kafu rice was 132 yuan, 131 yuan, high-quality was 136 yuan, and small-grained rice was opened at 125 yuan in the morning, and then it was only 124 yuan, 123.5 yuan. The price of non-bank stores was 124 yuan, and then it was 122.5 yuan. Dutch rice was 134 yuan, and the price of Tokyo premium pointed rice was originally 156 yuan, and then it was 112 yuan, broken pointed rice was 96 yuan, 94 yuan, and then 91 yuan, 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty of transportation and the lack of arrivals of thick and thin Japonica rice, people's hearts were still prosperous. Local shops were enthusiastic, and the owners cherished their goods, so the selling price was raised by 2-3 yuan after bargaining. The early and late rice of the new Kaian Port was 156 yuan to 154 yuan, the original bag of Wuxi Japonica rice was 150 yuan, 148 yuan, the high-quality rice was 153 yuan, and the inferior rice was 143-144 yuan. The new rice from Pudong is subject to changes in the weather. Now that the weather is clear, people's hearts are inevitably weaker, and although it is opened at 8 shih, the price has depreciated by 2 yuan, opening at 157 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also stabilized, following the trend of foreign rice. The opening price was similar to that of the previous week, and Hong Kong white rice was still high at 126 yuan to 124 yuan, and glutinous green beans were 115 yuan to 113 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Stagnant and Weak</h3>
<p>The current foreign flour market has softened. It was found that the market was still stable at the opening in the morning, but as rice prices softened, profit-taking floaters took the opportunity to sell at high prices. The initial price of Golden Dragon Flour was 32.56 yuan, but it quickly softened to 32.3 yuan. The prices of Battery Flour 33.89 yuan and Banana Flour 32.9 yuan were slightly lower by one or two corners compared to the weekend. The market for Clock Tower Flour was weak, but the supply of Lianri Japan Factory Flour was extremely small. The stock has long been depleted, and there are many people in the street who need it. The return of the old shipment was 34.12 yuan, and the battleship was 34 yuan. There were also 300-500 bags of new transactions. Although the market situation is weak, it is temporarily difficult to get through small.</p>
<p>Due to the nearby period of security, the source of new wheat is extremely small, and the factories have repeatedly released prices due to the difficulty of purchasing. It is heard that the Japanese factory has received 100-200 bags at a price of 44-45 yuan. Due to the shortage of goods received at the store, they are negotiating with the inland.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Are Subjected to Manipulation</h3>
<p>The source of soybeans has been quite delayed recently, and the price of oil has risen sharply, so those who hold the goods are all taking advantage of the situation to bargain for higher prices. Yesterday, 800 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, and the price hit a peak of 62 yuan. The price of 500 bags of Qingkou soybeans was 52 yuan to 53.5 yuan. The price of 600 bags of Guide soybeans was 51.5 yuan to 52 yuan, which was 1-2 yuan higher than before. On the 11th, 1,135 bags of soybeans and 3,000 pieces of bean cake were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Edible Oil Is Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market was clearly stable and secretly firm, because the authorities once again implemented price limits. The price of Dalian soybean oil per 50 quintals must not exceed 214.4 yuan, and the price of Qingdao raw oil must not exceed 213.56 yuan. However, the oil merchants generally cited the lack of sources as an excuse, and speculation was still fierce, so the potential trend was still firm. Tongshi sold 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, and the price was 274 yuan. There were also 30 barrels of soybean oil, and the price was 272 yuan. The price of 20 pieces each of Jiaozhou raw oil and soybean oil was 190 yuan. The price of 1,500 dan of Dayou Factory's pure oil was 180 yuan to 181.5 yuan, and the upper trade for August was 182 yuan, and the price of 700 dan of rapeseed oil, lower trade for August, was 185 yuan to 188 yuan. The rapeseed oil from Xintai and Lide was 182 yuan, and the rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory was 200 barrels, and the price was 182 yuan to 183 yuan. The door-to-door selling price of raw soybean oil has reached 2.1 yuan per catty.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Shipments of Cotton Yarn to Hong Kong Continue Uninterrupted; Fluctuations in Futures Yarn Prices Suddenly Widen</h3>
<p>Mill Orders Still Mostly Dumped Due to Poor Conditions</p>
<p>The yarn market over the past two days has been in a state of flux, with trends difficult to grasp due to sudden rises and falls. The spot yarn situation is quite good, with strong sales of 32-count single yarn and shortages of spot goods, leading to a significant price surge. Other 20-count mixed-brand yarns are also rising in price daily, but 20-count Double Horse mill orders are relatively weak. This is because the mills face unfavorable conditions, leading speculators to unanimously dump them, and holders of spot goods are also eagerly selling to lock in profits. Therefore, even though foreign exchange has tightened and margin calls have soared, the price of Double Horse yarn, the benchmark for speculative purposes, has not risen accordingly. However, the gold trading and securities trading groups are consistently buying, maintaining long positions, resulting in fierce competition. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,589, and the low was $1,576. In the early afternoon, the price initially rose to $1,606, then followed the rise in gold prices to $1,617. As those who had profited took their gains, the price fell back to $1,596, with the final price being $1,600. Shipments of yarn to Hong Kong continue uninterrupted, with 1,650 bales shipped yesterday.</p>
<p>Double Horse futures opened higher in the morning due to profit-taking, leading to a somewhat weak market sentiment. The initial price was $1,580, with a significant influx of sellers, soon dropping to $1,579. However, hearing that margin calls were not falling, short sellers covered their positions, pushing the price back up to $1,586 or $1,587. Unexpectedly, the auction house's auction of forward contracts led to a price drop, causing widespread anxiety and a further drop to $1,576. However, the Cantonese merchants' spot yarn trading was not bad, slightly boosting the market sentiment, but the price fluctuated between $1,588 and $1,589 several times. Around noon, with margin calls remaining tight, short covering led to a reversal in the market, with buyers emerging and pushing the price up to $1,606 at the close. A statistical analysis of trading volume during the half-day shows 8,120 bales were traded. The amount purchased by various groups is as follows:</p>
<p>The Gold Double Horse futures market situation went from sluggish to straight up, with price fluctuations suddenly widening. The range of highs and lows for the day was $17 to $33. At the beginning of the morning, the initial opening saw foreign exchange rates lengthen, and spot yarn prices fell by more than ten dollars. For a time, many parties were watching and intending to buy was light, while short sellers and speculators took the opportunity to forcefully cover their positions. Therefore, the opening price for August futures was $1,448, falling a substantial $17. September futures were $1,530, and October futures were $1,537, each down by $5 to $7. However, in the middle of trading, rumors spread that the situation between the U.S. and Japan was easing, and there were reports that a major trader was absorbing spot yarn. This boosted market sentiment, and buyers waited for opportunities to move. Short sellers also mostly covered their positions, and the market was filled with buying interest, causing prices to rebound, rising by as much as $4.50 to $17. The midday close for August futures was $1,452.50, September futures were $1,527.50, and October futures were $1,549, with August and September futures still down by $7.50 to $12.50 compared to Saturday, while October futures were flat. In the afternoon, the opening price was remarkably strong, due to the surging spot yarn and gold markets. As a result, the opening price reached $1,480, a rise of more than $27.50. However, as those who had made profits took their gains and sellers emerged to sell at high prices, the price fell back down. The closing price for August futures was $1,460, September futures were $1,535, and October futures were $1,544. Compared to the previous weekend, September futures were flat, while August and October futures were each down by $5. Looking at the trend, its foundation is not yet fully consolidated, as the high peaks of the spot yarn and gold markets show signs of divergence, which is the biggest reason. In reality, it is hindered by customer sales and the mill's selling, so those involved should pay attention to this. The table of daily market prices is listed below:</p>
<h3>Flower Prices Too High: Mill Demand Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is quite expensive, but consumption is not strong. Although margin calls are rising, yarn prices are not rising strongly. Therefore, mills' absorption of raw materials is sluggish and unpromising.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Sharply Rise</h3>
<p>- 4,900 Bags of Sugar from Hong Kong -</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a surge in prices due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the rise in gold prices, coupled with a 2% increase in war risk insurance fees. This led to a rush of imports, causing prices to soar by $4-5 to $6-7. For company futures, 24 coarse white sugar for August 20th delivery initially traded at $113.60, then rose to $116.80, $118, and $119.20. It later closed at $117.90, a rise of $4.40. August-end contracts opened at $117, $119.80, and $118.60, reaching a high of $122.50, and closing at $120.07 and $120.30. The guild quoted spot 24 coarse white sugar for July delivery at $115, $117.80, $119.70, and $118.50, a rise of $6. Older goods for other months were discounted by $0.50 per month.

There were rumors in the market that the supply of Dutch sugar would be cut off, but 4,920 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Tightening of Foreign Exchange Benefits Cotton Fabric Exports</h3>
<p>Mill Fabric: The market was stable yesterday, and fabric prices were firm and strong, mainly because foreign exchange has recently tightened, while fabric prices have risen only slightly, making exports more favorable. Therefore, buyers from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia are most interested. Dyeing factories are also purchasing large quantities of gray cloth, with the Shenxin No. 9 Mill supplying the most. Over the past week, nearly 1,000 pieces of Fuguì fine cloth twill have been released as spot goods, and over 900 pieces of 11-pound coarse cloth futures. The supply from other mills is minimal. Yesterday, the opening prices for various fabrics were flat. Over 1,000 pieces were transacted on this street, and buyers from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia purchased over 800 pieces of bleached and dyed fabric. 1,630 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 11th.</p>
<p>Eastern Fabric: Selling prices were slightly firm. Medium-grade fine cloth rose by $0.05 to $0.25. Longtou fine cloth fell by $0.10, fine twill rose by $0.10 to $0.25, and Sijunzi serge new and old store orders rose by 0.5% to 1%.</p>
<h3>Coal: Using Tightening Foreign Exchange as an Excuse, Coal Briquette Plants Increase Prices Again</h3>
<p>Coal briquette prices have been relatively stable in recent months due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, the plants, using the excuse of tightening foreign exchange and high costs of materials, increased their prices again by $12. Nanyang and Yitaixing's prices from their own warehouses were $308 per ton. The price for storefronts on this street, delivered to customers, was $332, and the retail price was $16.60 per dan, also an increase of $0.60.</p>

<h3>Regulations of the Bank of China: Handling Unsettled Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Checks and drafts pledged before the freeze will still be paid; accounts must be transferred to the Central Bank within a specified time.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. government issued special notices to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China, safeguarding China's legitimate foreign trade, the handling of foreign exchange transactions by Chinese commercial banks will be concentrated in these four banks. Chinese commercial banks, unless specifically authorized, will no longer be allowed to engage in foreign exchange business. It is learned that over ten Chinese commercial banks in this city that engage in foreign exchange have separately received English circulars from the Bank of China last week, specifying five points for handling various unsettled foreign exchange transactions.</p>
<p>Five Regulations Specified in the Circular</p>
<p>The circular begins by stating that the New York office has telegraphed that all accounts with that office have been frozen, except for the following situations: (1) Funds used to finance trade between the U.S. and China, which must comply with the provisions of General Notice No. 58. (2) All checks and drafts issued before July 26, 1941, will still be paid from these accounts, but must comply with the provisions of General Notice No. 55. However, this notice expired on August 26, 1941. (3) If transferring funds to any bank in the U.S., it can be done through the Central Bank account in accordance with General Notice No. 60 (Note: No. 60 is specifically addressed to the Central Bank). (4) Special notices may be issued for all other individual transactions. (5) Effective from June 14.</p>
<p>Chinese Commercial Banks Prepare Reports</p>
<p>According to a report from the Dazhong News Agency, various Chinese commercial banks in this city that engage in foreign exchange business have received official letters from the Bankers Association, instructing them to list the detailed amounts of all unsettled foreign exchange transactions before July 26 of this year and submit them to the Association. Last week, these documents were submitted one after another.</p>
<h3>American President Lines: Two Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The news of the U.S. President Lines' ship, the President Coolidge, which was requisitioned by the Aviation Committee, temporarily resuming its voyage to the East, has been repeatedly reported. It is now learned that this ship decided to resume its voyage, departing from San Francisco, via Honolulu, and directly to Little Luzon. It is scheduled to return from Little Luzon this afternoon (time uncertain), via Hong Kong to Shanghai, berthing at buoy numbers 11 and 12. It is expected to spend a sufficient amount of time in Shanghai, and is scheduled to depart for the U.S. on the morning of the 14th. It will still not call at Japanese ports. It is heard that in addition to the President Coolidge, the company has another ship departing from Los Angeles, via San Francisco and Honolulu, directly to Shanghai, and then from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. It is expected to arrive this week, but the ship's name has not been announced.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates and Prices Will Soon Return to Normal</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee believes that since the U.S. implemented the freezing of funds at China's request, the legal currency exchange rate has become increasingly stable. It has decided to follow its established policy and continue to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate to safeguard the legitimate trade of Chinese merchants and friendly nations. The sharp contraction of the Shanghai market exchange rate is due to short covering and speculation by importers using false names. This is a temporary phenomenon and will soon return to normal. The unreasonable rise in prices in Shanghai is due to hoarders deliberately exaggerating the impact of the freeze. Once the exchange rate returns to normal, prices will also return to normal. Therefore, it is hoped that the people will not be misled by rumors and cause unnecessary panic.</p>
<h3>Price Controls on Cooking Oil</h3>
<p>The French authorities have issued a notice that prices will be based on those of the 8th.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the situation in the Far East, the prices of soybean oil and peanut oil have increased significantly in recent weeks, indicating illegal price gouging. The French authorities have decided to strictly punish this and have issued a notice to merchants, setting the retail price at $2.16 per jin (half a liter) based on the prices of August 8. No increases are allowed without the approval of the Price Evaluation Committee. The French authorities have also decided not to allow price increases without valid documentation to prove the reasons for the increase.</p>
<h3>Control of Various Essential Goods Ordered by the Ministry</h3>
<p>Implementation of Price Tagging and Invoicing System</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has issued a notice to chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions, instructing them to implement operational controls on essential goods in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Control of Industry, Commerce, and Organizations During the Extraordinary Period," and to crack down on speculation. It stipulates that: (1) All companies, firms, and factories must apply for registration in accordance with the law. (2) Small-scale businesses engaged in essential goods must join trade associations. (3) All companies, firms, and factories must comply with the operational controls of trade associations and chambers of commerce, and there must be no speculation. Those who violate the above items should be reported to the competent authorities for punishment, and members should be supervised to comply with laws and regulations, strive to increase production, reduce costs, develop business, guide members to report hoarding, assist the authorities in stabilizing the market, implement price tagging and invoicing systems, prevent unfair competition among businesses, and sell at prices stipulated by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>The regular meeting of the Rotary Club of Shanghai this week is scheduled for noon on Thursday, August 14, at the Metropole Hotel. Dr. Huizenga will speak on "Various Issues Regarding the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association." This topic not only concerns public health issues in this city. Those who wish to invite friends to attend should call (16450).</p>
<h3>Australia's First Minister to China Will Soon Go to Chongqing to Assume His Post</h3>
<p>Anticipating Possible Shortage of Daily Necessities, Supplies Are Being Prepared and Shipped via the Burma Road</p>
<p>According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australian Minister Sir Frederic Eggleston and his staff will bring a large amount of goods to Chongqing from Australia to alleviate the difficulty of lacking certain foods after arriving in the capital. Foods such as butter, meat, and other canned foods, which were previously abundant in Chongqing, are now in short supply. Therefore, Sir Frederic Eggleston has this plan. At the same time, it is heard that Sir Frederic also intends to bring glassware and household daily necessities to China, as a suitable embassy and residence have not yet been found in Chongqing. Even if there is a suitable place, the furniture and other equipment are also quite problematic. Sir Frederic and his staff plan to transport the luggage, food, and furniture they bring via the Burma Road, and purchase a car in Rangoon. Sir Frederic already has three secretaries and needs to hire a clerk and a chauffeur.</p>
<h3>Citywide Military and Police Mobilization: Special Alert Begins Today</h3>
<p>Traffic Restrictions on All Bridges Over the Suzhou Creek; Tram Routes Ordered to Be Temporarily Shortened</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the International Settlement began a special alert on the morning of the 9th, it has been peaceful for the past three days. As tomorrow is the anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai, the authorities have decided to strengthen security measures starting this morning to make prevention more stringent. In addition to the full mobilization of all police officers, all U.S. and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai have also been fully mobilized, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has also been ordered to mobilize. The tense situation is more serious than last year and is unprecedented in the history of this city.</p>
<p>Security Especially Tight in Newspaper District</p>
<p>The police authorities have always been extremely careful in preventing problems with the various newspapers in the International Settlement. As the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai is approaching, starting yesterday, additional detectives were stationed near the North-China Daily News, the China Press, The Times, the Chang Geng Li Sino-American Daily, and the Chinese newspapers on Hankou Road to maintain safety.</p>
<p>Bridge Blockades and Traffic Restrictions</p>
<p>The bridges along the Suzhou Creek, including the Garden Bridge, the Zhapu Road Bridge, and the Sichuan Road Bridge, have been controlled by the Japanese since the war. The Japanese will continue to cut off traffic on the Zhapu Road, Sichuan Road, and Xinza Road bridges, with only the Garden Bridge open to Hongkou. The Jiangxi Road Bridge and the Potang Nong Bridge are blocked by the International Settlement. The Laozha Bridge is only open to pedestrians, the Zhejiang Road Bridge is only open to vehicles, and the Tianhou Gong Bridge is open to both vehicles and pedestrians. However, all the northern and southern ends of the bridges are guarded by armed detectives who conduct searches.</p>
<p>Japanese Military on High Alert in the Suburbs of Shanghai</p>
<p>The Japanese military in the Shanghai suburbs has been on high alert for several days. In addition to blockading the bridges, they have also strictly blockaded all land and water transportation lines around the settlement as a precautionary measure. Anyone who cannot produce special identification documents will not be allowed to pass. It is also learned that the Japanese blocked the Xiaohuaide Road Bridge and cut off traffic between 10:45 AM and 10:59 AM on the morning of the 10th, and the Japanese Marines conducted a major search in the area, but found nothing.</p>
<p>Tram Routes Shortened</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tramways Company, following a notice from the police, has temporarily shortened the route of the No. 16 trolleybus from Shan'anyangjing Bridge to Caojiadu, starting yesterday morning. It will only run to Dazimingzhong as the terminus. At the same time, trams on routes 5, 6, and 7, which run to the North Railway Station, have also been rerouted to stop in front of the First Special District Court. Buses on routes 2, 9, 1-4 will only run to Jing'an Temple as the terminus. Buses on routes 10 and 7 will all terminate in front of the Connaught Road Bus Company. They are expected to resume their previous routes on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Further Developments in the Case of Theodore Pont Arrested</h3>
<p>Public Trial Awaiting Instructions; Conspiracy Being Investigated</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", Theodore Pont, acting chief executive officer of the U.S. Court for China, was arrested for embezzling U.S. government property. Unable to post $5,000 bail, he was jailed in the Ward Road prison. It is reported that Pont has requested the Court to appoint a lawyer to defend him, which is likely to be approved. The Court is now awaiting instructions from Washington to determine whether to</p>
<p>Conduct a public trial. It is not yet known when the trial will begin, as U.S. Judge Helmick is currently on leave in the United States. It is expected that instructions from Washington to the U.S. Court will arrive in Shanghai this week to decide whether to instruct Helmick to return to Shanghai early or to appoint a special judge to hear the case. U.S. Court Prosecutor Hils issued a statement to the press this morning (11th), implying that there may be other developments in the case and describing the arrest of Pont last Saturday, but did not disclose details of the investigation. The statement said that during Judge Helmick's absence, U.S. citizens have been law-abiding and do not require legal attention. After Executive Officer Leech returned to Shanghai for a summer vacation, Pont was appointed as acting executive officer, responsible for funds, distributing salaries to staff members, and managing the Court's property, including military equipment. On Saturday, the police of the Public Works Department handed over the collected evidence to them. After a week of research, they formally charged Pont with embezzling U.S. property in his possession. Since the Executive Officer had already left his post, and apart from Pont, only Deputy Executive Officer Mrs. Minge was in position, they had no choice but to ask Mrs. Minge to carry out this task, which did not seem appropriate for a woman, to</p>
<p>Arrest Pont. Mrs. Minge immediately asked Detective Kraedon of the police department to arrest Pont. The statement concluded by saying that he was busy investigating Pont's activities and could not disclose other details about the case, for fear of alarming the snake and allowing Pont's accomplices to escape.</p>
<h3>Moonlight Theater Party Held: "Great Britain Night"</h3>
<p>The "Moonlight Theater Party" founded by the North-China Daily News has been held many times with great success, beyond expectations. If the weather permits, "Great Britain Night" will be held this Wednesday. At that time, British dignitaries here will attend and participate. In the future, "Russia Night," "Norway Night," and "Greece Night" will be held in turn. There will be a lucky draw program at the last event. According to the person in charge of the event, all proceeds from "Russia Night" held on Thursday evening will be donated to the Russian War Fund.</p>
<h3>Dutch Citizens Staying in Shanghai Will Not Evacuate for Now; Dutch Ships Have Not Suspended Service</h3>
<p>The Situation in the Far East Has Not Reached the Final Stage; Dutch Citizens Are Still Watching for Business Reasons</p>
<p>The "Zhishadani" Ship Can Arrive in Shanghai Next Week</p>
<p>The Dutch government, in light of the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, in order to protect the safety of its citizens, ordered and advised Dutch citizens in China to evacuate the occupied areas of China as soon as possible. The Dutch Consulate in Shanghai, after receiving the order, posted a notice on the 9th stating that all "Chinese Dutch citizens" should report to the consulate immediately. It is learned that because the situation in the Far East has not yet reached the most serious stage, very few Dutch citizens have gone to register in preparation for evacuation. However, it has been confirmed that the first-class cabins of the Dutch ship "Zhibade" that left Shanghai the other day were almost entirely occupied by British and American citizens evacuating from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Preparedness for Evacuation Measures</p>
<p>According to a report from the Dazhong News Agency, since the Dutch Consulate issued the notice, all Dutch people entering or leaving Shanghai must register with the consulate. However, only a few dozen people have registered. The total number of Dutch citizens currently in Shanghai is estimated to be over 400, of which over 100 are Dutch, and the rest are Dutch Chinese. Among the Dutch Chinese, some are students studying in Shanghai, and their living expenses are remitted monthly by their families in the Dutch East Indies. The amount remitted must be approved by the Dutch East Indies authorities and is strictly limited, so there is little surplus. If the situation in the Far East escalates to the most serious stage, remittances will be difficult, and the lives of these people will be very difficult. Preparations should be made for this in advance.</p>
<p>Business Maintained as Usual in Shanghai</p>
<p>Of the 200 Dutch citizens, apart from women and children, there are only over 90 men, most of whom are engaged in business in Shanghai. Currently, Dutch companies in Shanghai include the Dutch Bank and the Anda Bank, Java Shipping Company, Shanghai Insurance Company, Wanglai Insurance Company, and over a dozen import and export firms, all of which are maintaining business as usual. Due to their duties and business relationships, Dutch citizens are unwilling to leave immediately, so in practice, very few can comply with the order to evacuate.</p>
<p>Reasons for Delays of Dutch Ships</p>
<p>The Dutch merchant Java Mailboat Company's irregular liner "Zhishali" was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Java on the 1st of this month. Unexpectedly, it received an order from the Dutch government to evacuate and cancelled the trip to Shanghai. Recently, it was heard that the regular mail ship "Zhizhalianjia" also returned to Batavia midway. The mail ship "Zhibade" in Shanghai delayed its departure, leading to speculation from the outside world. Yesterday, a reporter visited the company and learned from a Chinese employee in charge that "Zhishali" did not come because of a government order. The reason why the mail ship "Zhizhalianjia" did not come to Shanghai was that the "Zhibade" ship was delayed in returning to Java. If "Zhizhalianjia" still came to Shanghai, there might be problems with the shipping schedule, so it turned back midway. There were two reasons why the "Zhibade" ship was delayed in departing: first, the export goods were congested and could not be loaded immediately, and second, there was a typhoon, so it was delayed until noon on the 10th to depart. It will still follow its original route, returning to Surabaya via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and various ports in Southeast Asia. Rumors of the suspension of Dutch ships do not correspond with the facts. It was also said that the company's mail ship "Zhishadani" can arrive this week.</p>
<h3>French Authorities Reviewed the Rice Market Yesterday, Adding Evaluations of White Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Evaluating the Price at $153 per Stone; Prices of Other Imported Rice Remain the Same</p>
<p>The French Concession Price Evaluation Committee repeatedly decided to invite leaders from various industries in this city to discuss stabilizing the entire food supply in Shanghai. At the first meeting on the 28th of last month, it evaluated and set price limits for four types of imported rice, ordering all rice shops in the city to comply. This measure by the committee not only benefited the food supply for Shanghai citizens, but also won praise from all sectors of the city. The Committee, to</p>
<p>Continue Reviewing</p>
<p>The entire rice market in Shanghai and examining whether the prices of the four types of imported rice that have been evaluated and set price limits are up to standard, convened leaders from various industries again yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the rice market. The attendees included over a dozen representatives from the rice industry, the firewood and coal industry, the wine and soy sauce industry, the Chinese and foreign catering industry, and the fresh meat industry. Zhu Yigui, Chinese Secretary of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, also attended. The meeting was still chaired by Weiner. As a result of the discussions, in addition to evaluating a type of white rice at $153 per stone, the</p>
<p>Price limits for the other four types of imported rice will remain the same as those evaluated on the 4th of this month, namely: (1) Saigon No. 1: $126; (2) Saigon No. 2: $119; (3) Cheap Little Jiao Rice: $116; (4) Mixed Broken Contributions of No. 1 and No. 2: $89. Yesterday, according to a member of the committee speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, rice shops and residents who are unable to obtain the mixed broken contributions of No. 1 and No. 2 purchased by the French authorities can contact Mr. Zhu Yigui, Chinese Secretary of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, from today. At the same time, rice shops selling the above-mentioned rice grains must not secretly raise prices or steal or adulterate measurements. Anyone who knows of such base behavior can report it to the nearest police station so that it can be investigated and dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Wire Broken by Wind, One Life Tragically Lost</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that during the hurricane that passed over Shanghai last Friday, some electric wires along Hongqiao Road were blown down, resulting in a tragic incident yesterday (the 10th) morning in which a groom and two horses were electrocuted. Three foreigners also narrowly escaped death. These three were Mr.旭斯德, general manager of 裕德洋行 at 242 Hamilton Mansion, Mr. 薛森, a shareholder of 興成洋行 at 66 Museum Road, and Mrs. 薛森.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:30, they were riding together on Hongqiao Road. Mr. 旭氏's Chinese groom was riding ahead when the horse suddenly touched a wire on the ground. It was shocked and fell, and the groom was pinned under the horse. As he struggled to free himself, he inadvertently grabbed the wire and was immediately electrocuted and died along with the horse. Mrs. 薛森's horse also touched the wire, was shocked, and jumped up, throwing Mrs. 薛森 to the ground. Fortunately, she was far from the wire and was not injured, only slightly scratched.</p>
<p>The horse she was riding died on the spot. The groom's body was taken away by the French Municipal Council ambulance. It is said that the fallen wire was a Japanese military wire, which was blown off the pole by the hurricane and fell onto the Shanghai Power Company's main line, so the electricity was extremely strong. It then hung to the ground, causing instant death to anyone who touched it. Afterwards, the power company sent personnel to the scene to repair it.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Water Level Surges, Embankments Collapse Along the Banks</h3>
<p>Surging Over Twenty Feet, Extremely Dangerous Conditions in Madang and Other Places</p>
<p>Due to the heavy rainfall this summer and the melting snow from the Kunlun Mountains upstream, the Yangtze River has surged, and many embankments along the river have been submerged. According to inquiries with the Jianghai Customs Maritime Affairs Bureau, the Yangtze River has been rising rapidly recently. In the middle reaches, such as Yichang, the water level suddenly rose from over ten feet to over thirty feet. The water level in Hankou has also increased sharply, affecting the water level in the lower reaches. The water levels in Jiujiang, Anqing, and Wuhu have all increased by more than twenty feet. Currently, in waterways such as Madang and Jiaoshan, many embankments have collapsed due to the high water level, and even more riverbanks have been submerged. Navigation at night is extremely dangerous, and difficulties in navigation are increasing. Before the war, the customs offices in Jiujiang, Wuhu, and Anqing all had water level indicators to guide navigation, but these have been neglected for a long time.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached Between Labor and Management in the Hosiery Industry</h3>
<p>Recently, disputes arose between labor and management in the city's hosiery industry due to wage increases. The trade association and the labor union have now reached an agreement that both parties are willing to accept, expressing sincere cooperation. The agreement is recorded as follows: (1) Wages will be increased uniformly by 60% according to the trade association's average price list. (2) Regarding the issue of food and lodging, based on the nature of each factory in the past, male workers will not be provided with food and lodging, while female workers will be provided with food. This will continue according to the old practice, but the employers will subsidize the food costs by 55 cents. (3) Employers may not dismiss workers without reason. If a worker resigns or the factory stops a worker's work, both parties must give ten days' notice to each other, unless there is serious misconduct, but direct mutual agreement is the main principle. (4) This agreement will take effect immediately.</p>
<h3>Current Methods for Exchange in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Regarding exchange in various parts of Eastern Zhejiang, (1) Shaoxing, Ningbo, Zhuji, Xiaowangmiao, Cixi, Shipu, Zhenhai, Shangyu, Fengqiao, Paitou, Yuyao, Changkou, Dongguan, Daqitou, Songxia, Sunduan, Anchang, Chaiqiao, Hushan, Guali, Zhendaqiao, Ma'an, Yiqiao, Guanhaiwei, Zhouxiang, Xiafangqiao, Xikou, Luotuoqiao, Zhuangqiao, Shenshiqiao, Xiangshan, Haiyou, Wufu, Keqiao and other places are currently suspended for exchange. (2) Jinhua, Yongkang, Dongyang, Yiwu, Shengxian and other places are continuing to provide normal exchange services, with amounts ranging from 30 to 100 yuan. There is a supplementary water fee of 2 cents per yuan and an exchange fee of 1 cent per yuan.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Americas Achieve Excellent Results in Contributing to the Purchase of Warships: Their Enthusiasm, Though Not From the Wealthy, Is Unsurpassed; Their Organized Efforts Serve as a Model</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, overseas Chinese in the Americas have successively established patriotic organizations and actively donated funds to support the war effort. Their enthusiasm is unprecedented in past patriotic movements. It is estimated that the total number of overseas Chinese residing in North, Central, and South America, including native-born Chinese, is 225,000. In the past four years, their patriotic donations have amounted to US$15 million. In the United States alone, the number of overseas Chinese, including men, women, children, and the elderly, is less than 80,000. According to statistics, their donations have exceeded US$10 million, which is equivalent to 200 million National Currency based on the current exchange rate. On average, each person has donated US$125. If we exclude women, children, the elderly, and those who are unemployed and unable to donate, the number of people with the ability to donate is 40,000, which means that on average, each person has donated US$250.</p>
<p>Appraising Amounts and Subscribing Monthly: These donations are earned through the hard work and sweat of ordinary overseas Chinese. Adult overseas Chinese in various places are required to donate monthly, with the amount determined by the local patriotic associations. Generally, each person must donate US$5 per month. Those with better financial means donate according to their ability. For those who cannot afford to donate, there is a donation assessment committee to determine the amount they should donate. Only those who are poor or ill and unable to donate are allowed to have their donations reduced or waived. Taking Los Angeles as an example, there are over 2,300 overseas Chinese in the area who make a living through business. Since the war began, they have donated over US$500,000 to the country, including US$140,000 in national salvation bonds, US$30,000 for refugee relief, 64 ambulances totaling US$65,000, US$110,000 for aviation salvation donations, and US$30,000 for winter clothing donations. Most of them work in the laundry or restaurant business and are not wealthy, but their patriotic enthusiasm is a model for the world.</p>
<p>Collaborating to Promote the Industrial Cooperatives Movement: Furthermore, the overseas Chinese in Chicago, numbering over a thousand, have modest incomes, but their donations have also reached over one million US dollars. Liang Shichun, director of the China Industrial Cooperative Association's Promotion Office, went to the United States in March, and in addition to assisting in expanding fundraising efforts across the United States to support China, he also reported on the development of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement to foreign friends. As a result, overseas Chinese in various places have a deeper understanding of the Industrial Cooperative Movement and are willing to help promote it. On May 30, the "Overseas Chinese Promotion Committee for the Industrial Cooperatives in the United States" was established. At the same time, the Honolulu Industrial Cooperative Promotion Committee also announced its establishment. These associations have been approved and registered by the Chongqing headquarters, and it is reported that Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the association, has sent letters of commendation. In order to strengthen overseas promotion work, the Industrial Cooperative Association has specially appointed overseas Chinese leaders in various places as directors.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Myanmar Launch Vehicle Donation Campaign: As for the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, they are also enthusiastically making contributions. According to official reports, from the beginning of the war to October of last year, overseas Chinese in Singapore remitted 12,576,800.61 yuan, in the Dutch East Indies 37,569,755.04 yuan, in the Philippines 25,684,356.55 yuan, in Thailand 10,429,090.95 yuan, in India and Myanmar 9,885,248.01 yuan, and in Vietnam 7,390,870.67 yuan. Recently, the Myanmar Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Association launched a vehicle donation campaign among overseas Chinese throughout Myanmar to strengthen transportation in the motherland. It has now raised over 300,000 kyats and purchased 150 new vehicles, which will be donated to the government.</p>
<p>Two Ships Test Navigation to Ao River</p>
<p>Ships Registered Under German and Italian Consulates Are Prohibited From Sailing to Coastal Ports in Zhejiang and Fujian: After the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese navy, foreign ships sailing to Zhejiang and Fujian have been suspended for almost a year. Recently, it was reported that two small ships, Da Xin and Da Li, were testing navigation to Ao River. It is said that Da Li has already returned to Shanghai, and Da Xin has also arrived at Ao River. These two small ships have a load capacity of only a few dozen tons and are both chartered by Hakkas. The freight rate is as high as 1,400 to 1,600 yuan per ton. It is rumored that the German company Far East Company's ship, Hanna, is also planning to test navigation to Gu'aotou. However, the company stated yesterday that this is absolutely not true, because the Hanna is several times larger than the two small ships and is a more conspicuous target, making it impossible to sail stealthily on the sea. It also stated that only ships of the same size as the two small ships can sail, and larger ships have no hope of resuming navigation. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired with the shipping industry, the German and Italian consulates general in Shanghai recently notified the shipping companies registered under their respective consulates that, for the sake of navigation safety, they are prohibited from sailing to the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian. There are no restrictions on sailing to the ports in the Chinese occupied areas of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It is generally believed that this measure is to prohibit German and Italian ships from sailing to the unoccupied areas of China, and the duration is not temporary.</p>
<p>China-Soviet Trade Company Decides to Liquidate</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, cargo transportation on the Siberian Railway has become prosperous, and those in Shanghai who engaged in China-Soviet trade have sprung up like mushrooms, showing promising development. However, since Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, transportation has been affected first, and business has changed accordingly. The China-Soviet Trade Co., Ltd., located at 430 North Shansi Road, is a fairly large-scale company, and the Chinese founders are all well-known figures. It is reported that the company moved to a corner of the third floor at 2 Bund, French Concession, yesterday and drastically reduced its staff. It has been confirmed that the company's board of directors has decided to liquidate and cease new transactions. It is a pity that a new and emerging business has become a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>New Japanese Financial Officer Arrives in Shanghai by Ship</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, after the former financial officer of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai, Kiuchi, was ordered to return to his home country to take up a new position, the Japanese side appointed Masaki Obara, director of the Tokyo Monopoly Bureau, to succeed him. At 6:30 PM on the 10th, Obara arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru and disembarked at Huishan Wharf. Accompanying him was Kazuhira Okamoto, a Japanese official of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th, but was delayed by one day due to encountering a hurricane en route. According to Obara, he had previously visited Shanghai for a short stay of two or three days when traveling to Europe, so he was not familiar with the situation in Shanghai. In the future, he will listen to opinions from all parties for reference.</p>

<h3>Enrollment Issues Resolved Satisfactorily: Disaster Orphans Have Food and Lodging, Banks and Businesses Respond Enthusiastically with Donations, and Zhengzhong Girls' High School Establishes Special Shen Bao Scholarships</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund received generous donations from a certain bank and its fundraiser, Shan Ji, yesterday. In one day, over 4,000 yuan was raised. The banking community's enthusiastic support for education is commendable and will greatly expand the fund and brighten its prospects. The investigation work continued actively yesterday, and more than twenty students came to the office for interviews. Those who have already applied and have been admitted to schools or have gone to other schools should promptly send a letter to notify us for verification. Regarding the food and lodging arrangements for the three disaster orphans, Ni, Bao, and Wu, who were the first to be called for relief, Director Hua of the Disaster Orphanage has made satisfactory arrangements. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Food and Lodging for Disaster Orphans Resolved Satisfactorily: According to Director Hua of the Disaster Orphanage, "For the past two weeks, we have been earnestly seeking assistance from various churches and charitable organizations, but to no avail. Fortunately, Lida Academy received sponsorship from Fuxing Restaurant. After several discussions, the owner of the restaurant agreed to provide food for 36 yuan per person per month, including one porridge and two meals, and lodging on the upper floor of the restaurant, completely free of charge. We have paid half a year's worth of food expenses in advance. If prices rise further in the future, they will definitely not increase the price mid-way." The Scholarship Committee has decided to grant 250 yuan per semester per person to the three disaster orphans for food and lodging. After paying 216 yuan for food expenses, the remaining amount is only for books and miscellaneous expenses. The cost of clothing will continue to be provided by the orphanage, so that the three disaster orphans can study with peace of mind. On Sundays or holidays, the three students will return to the Disaster Orphanage, where Ms. Hua will check their homework and diligently teach them, so that their studies can improve steadily, living up to the expectations of the orphanage and the original intention of the scholarship fund. Finally, Ms. Hua said, "There is a special connection in the fact that these three students have found a place to live. The owner of the restaurant has three children studying at Zhenxin Primary School on Guling Road. The principal of the school, Ms. Tang Aimei, is a standing director of the Disaster Orphanage. It was through Ms. Tang's intercession that this was achieved. She also agreed to consult the restaurant from time to time to inquire about the students' studies, so as to coordinate the education they receive at the orphanage."</p>
<p>Zhengzhong Girls' High School Establishes Free Scholarships: Shanghai Zhengzhong Girls' High School also sent a letter establishing three free scholarships each for the second and third grades of high school. The original letter stated, "We are writing to express our deep admiration for your newspaper's launch of the Readers' Scholarship Fund to benefit aspiring impoverished students. Although our school's student representatives previously presented a small donation as a show of support, the amount was minimal. Our school was founded to implement education, cultivate talent, and reserve it for national use. At a time when living expenses in this city have suddenly increased dramatically, many young women will be unable to complete their high school education. Therefore, the school affairs committee has decided to establish three Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship positions in each of the second and third grades of high school. Those who are at this level and are introduced to the school after passing your newspaper's review will be exempt from all tuition fees in order to promote this cause." Our newspaper is very grateful for Zhengzhong Girls' High School's kindness and will adopt special flexible measures as published in yesterday's newspaper: (1) Any female student who believes that her academic ability is sufficient may write a letter stating her detailed academic history and family situation to apply, without having to fill out an application form. (2) All applicants should send a letter by the 16th of this month. Those who meet the requirements will be invited to the office for an interview. Those who do not meet the requirements will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Banks and Yarn Shops Respond to the Scholarship Fund: A certain bank wrote in a letter, "We are writing to send you a check for 3,000 yuan in national currency and a check for 1,000 yuan from Shan Ji as donations to your newspaper's Readers' Scholarship Fund. Please acknowledge receipt and issue two receipts respectively." Shen Da Yarn Shop also wrote in a letter, "We are writing to send you 104 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen in legal currency for your newspaper's scholarship fund. This amount is a small profit that our shop earned last month due to a business dispute that was resolved through mediation. We dare to offer it to show that our shop is not overly concerned with profit."</p>
<p>Over 4,000 Yuan Donated Yesterday: A certain large bank, 3,000 yuan; Shan Ji, 1,000 yuan; Shen Da Yarn Shop, 104 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen; Mr. Gong, 30 yuan; Miss Gu Miaojin, 15 yuan; Mr. Zhu Zhongguang of the New Sassoon Bank (missed collection, 11 yuan, 6 jiao, and 3 fen); Mr. Ye Yongkang, 10 yuan; Mr. Sun Shangxuan, 10 yuan; Mr. Zhang Zhuding, 4 yuan; Miss Gu Jing, 2 yuan. The above totals 4,187 yuan, 9 fen. Added to the previous deposit of 40,390 yuan, 6 jiao, and 9 fen, the total is 44,577 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Construction Factory, Indian Watchman Strangled to Death: More Than Ten Suspects Arrested and Sent to Court for Interrogation; Wife of the Deceased Arrives to Testify About the Incident</h3>
<p>On July 24, at around 1:00 AM, the Japanese-owned Yamaguchi Construction Factory on Baoshan Road was broken into by about ten Jiangbei ruffians, including Da Kua Tou, Xu Mao Tou, and Chen Er Mao, who had pre-hired three trucks. They climbed over the wall from the factory's back door and tied up the Indian watchman, Song Daxing, and his wife with ropes and stuffed their mouths with towels to prevent them from making noise. They opened the factory gate and stole building materials such as iron bars worth 18,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The stolen goods were loaded onto trucks and stored at the warehouse of Chen Daoying, a fellow villager of Huangjiasha on Carter Road. Later, because the Indian watchman, Song Daxing, was able to shout and resist slightly, the gang dragged him out of the factory gate and strangled him to death in a wasteland near Shiyulu. They then dug a hole to bury the body in an attempt to cover up their tracks. Recently, detectives Xu Decheng and Xie Zhiguang of the Gordon Road Police Station received information from informants and arrested the suspects, Chen Xuebao, Fei Jinbao, Shen Qifa, Sun Afa, Miao Qitai, Chen Daoying, Yang Baolin, Xu Wenyi, and suspects Bu Jinshan, Xu A'er, and Feng Yongfu, eleven Jiangbei residents, in hotels on Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road and on Avenue Edward VII. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian requested their detention on charges of theft and murder of Indian Song Daxing under the criminal law, stating that Song Daxing's body was found six days after the incident in a wasteland twenty-five yards from the factory and was identified by his wife, Qiang Daike.</p>
<p>She testified in court, saying that she suddenly saw four Chinese men arrive and, without asking why, tied her husband, Song Daxing, and herself with ropes, stuffed their mouths with towels, and blindfolded her. Later, her husband was able to call for help and was dragged out of the factory gate by the gang and murdered. Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated each of the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<p>Rice Shop on Avenue Petain Robbed, Shopkeeper Abducted</p>
<p>Car on Avenue du President Doumer Robbed</p>
<p>Lin Tai Rice Shop at 426 Avenue Petain, owned by Qian Linrong (31 years old) from Dachang, was thriving and attracted the attention of bandits. Yesterday at around 11:15 AM, six bandits, two armed with pistols, broke into the shop and kidnapped Qian, forcing him into a white-牌 taxi number 18074, which was waiting nearby, and speeding away. The shop reported the incident to the police. As of the time of publication, neither the man nor the car has been found. It is also reported that at around 12:00 PM yesterday, a black-牌 car number 1862 on Avenue du President Doumer was robbed by three bandits, who drove away without a trace. It is suspected that the car robbery is related to the previous case and is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Rice Shop's 8,000 Yuan Cash Escorted, Suddenly Robbed: Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, a major robbery of pedestrians occurred at the intersection of Beijing Road and Songjia Lane in the Public Concession. Gao Wenjun (32 years old), a shop assistant from Tongzhou at De Chengxin Rice Shop at 272 Avenue Haig, was ordered to escort 8,000 yuan in cash, which was the store's sales revenue from the previous day, to Zhengming Bank at 103 Ningbo Road for deposit. Gao placed the money in a small cloth bag for rice samples and took a taxi (license number 38047) to the bank. When he traveled from West to East, crossing Zhejiang Road, and drove to the scene of the incident, three bandits, who had been lying in wait, suddenly jumped out from the roadside. All of them were wearing long robes, one in a gray silk long gown, one in a serge long gown, and the other in a black short shirt, holding a pistol to block the road. After intimidating Gao, they robbed the cloth bag containing the 8,000 yuan in cash and fled without a trace. The shop assistant reported the incident to the police for investigation.</p>
<p>Rice Thieves Arrested</p>
<p>Hua detectives Li Pengfei and Wang Jinsheng of the Old Zhabei Police Station arrested rice thieves Lu Jifang, Hong Sanxi, Zhou Ajin, Wu Lugen, Su Binggen, Su Fuji, Chen Jinshi, and female Yang Xiaogou on North Suzhou Road and North Shansi Road. It was discovered that these people are mostly boatmen and warehouse managers who are responsible for managing the loading of rice for export on inland river shipping companies. They steal a portion of the rice during loading and sell it to Hefeng Rice Shop at 563 Tiantong Road, sharing the proceeds for their own use. Thirty-nine and a half bags of stolen rice were recovered at the rice shop and other places. They were transferred to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Because a detailed investigation is needed, police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested permission for their detention, and Judge Xiao ordered their detention for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<p>Dr. Wen, a Physician, Cures Strange Diseases</p>
<p>Dr. Wen Zanzen, a doctor of medicine from the University of Göttingen in Germany, served as an internist at the Berlin University Hospital for many years. After returning to China, he set up a clinic at Room 308, 3rd Floor, 587 Jing'an Temple Road and has cured many dangerous diseases. Recently, he also cured the strange disease of oral and tongue ulceration suffered by Mr. Zhou of Duofu Lane, Avenue Foch, which has increased the number of patients seeking treatment from him.</p>

<h3>A Record of Field Visits to Applicants for Financial Aid (6)</h3>
<p>The beginning of Julaida Road was in the hustle and bustle of the morning vegetable market. I entered a butcher shop and explained my purpose. Behind the shop, I groped my way up a narrow staircase to the second floor, then climbed a makeshift wooden ladder to the third level. That was the residence of the elementary school student I was to visit. Because I am tall, I had to bend over and lower my head to enter. The room was, of course, sparsely furnished. His mother was sitting on a small stool with a baby lying on her lap, picking vegetables. I explained my purpose, and she immediately got up and casually placed the baby on the bed. She then used Shanghai dialect with a Cantonese accent to describe the difficult situation of her family. Three other children, of varying ages, all wearing untidy clothes, stood around watching our conversation.</p>
<p>From her conversation, I learned that there were five children in her family. The oldest was the thirteen-year-old elementary school student I wanted to visit. Her husband worked on a ship and rarely stayed at home for more than a few days a month. His monthly income was only one hundred yuan. Under the heavy pressure of the high cost of living, maintaining a family of seven was indeed very difficult. At that time, the elementary school student had been sent out to shop by his mother and was not there. I also asked his mother for the student's Chinese, English, and math homework from school to verify his grades, which were indeed quite good. In particular, his handwriting was very mature.</p>
<p>His mother also told me a fact worth recording: "His father, because of the family's financial difficulties, really could not continue to afford his tuition. He had asked a friend to find him an apprenticeship in a store. When he received this news, he cried for several hours. Only after his mother's persuasion did he stop, but he was still prepared to beg his father to find a way for him to continue his studies when his father made a decision to come home. A few days later, he learned that this newspaper had a financial aid program. He happily told his mother and quickly completed the necessary procedures. The emotional state of sadness in his heart for the past few days immediately turned into one of joy and eager anticipation." At that time, the baby on the bed was crying, so I got up to leave.</p>
<p>The road was so lively. The maids of the wealthy families were hurrying back and forth with baskets full of fish and meat. (C)</p>
<p>The Son of the Chief Clerk</p>
<p>No. 393, Lane Radou, is a working-class neighborhood. Both sides are tall buildings. Who would have thought that countless coolies live in dozens of bungalows in this lane? These bungalows are short and simple, without house numbers, which made me stunned. Where should I find the applicant surnamed Xi? There were dozens of barefoot children playing games in the lane. I showed them the photo on the application form and asked if they knew this older child. They all said they didn't know. One child, who looked about ten years old, knew him and led me straight into the lane. Only then did I find the residence of the Xi family. Undoubtedly, it was also a bungalow. Unfortunately, the applicant had gone to see his mother. Only a girl of seventeen or eighteen was at home, who turned out to be the cousin of the Xi family. The child's mother worked as a servant for a foreign family, and the father worked as a chief clerk in Hong Kong. This child is very smart in his studies. After the summer vacation, he will be in the second year of junior high school. Last school year, due to his excellent grades, the school gave him a half-fee discount. He will still be eligible for the half-fee after the summer vacation, so he is only applying for half of the tuition and fees.</p>
<p>I wonder how many outstanding children from poor families are buried, unable to pursue further education. Shouldn't this be a loss to society! (T)</p>
<p>Struggling on the Lifeline</p>
<p>On the fake third floor of a tailor shop at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Wenlin Road, I discovered an unexpectedly tragic family. The area of the living room only occupies half of this fake third floor. The floor is covered with two worn mats. There are no beds or chairs, and only some messy clutter is piled in the corner of the wall. There is a lead bucket in the middle of the floor, with nothing else. A twelve or thirteen-year-old child and a girl with thick sores all over her head were sitting on the mat against the wall. A middle-aged or older man with a hunched back was sitting on the ground along the window, sighing and groaning, already too ill. I was so horrified that I didn't dare to step in, so I started talking to a middle-aged couple next door. From the woman's mouth, I learned half of their living situation. Later, I asked the twelve or thirteen-year-old boy about the whole picture of their family.</p>
<p>His mother and his eleven-year-old younger brother had not yet returned home from selling vegetables at the vegetable market. His father used to work as a supervisor on a section of the Longhai Railway, but has been unemployed for a long time. He is truly suffering from poverty and illness, and life is unbearable. His mother had no choice but to borrow a small loan of thirty yuan from "Night Sound" through an introduction to sell vegetables, hoping to earn a meager profit to maintain the lives of the five people in the family. His younger brother is the child who is applying to this newspaper for financial aid. After the summer vacation, he will be in the sixth grade. Now, because of the vacation, he accompanies his mother to Xujiahui every morning to sell vegetables, and then carries them to the Remi Road vegetable market to sell. It is said that they can earn two, three, or four yuan a day. The older child himself sells sesame balls or fried dough sticks and pancakes every morning, and popsicles in the afternoon. The whole family lives like this (T)</p>

<p>Summer Basketball Invitational League To Start Fighting for Supremacy the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Venue Changed to Ballroom</p>
<p>The Summer Basketball Four-Strong Invitational League was originally scheduled to start fighting for supremacy tomorrow, but due to the anniversary of August 13th, the organizing committee decided to postpone it by one day. Therefore, the opening date has been changed to this Thursday (that is, the day after tomorrow). The time is set to start at 5:45 in the afternoon. The venue was originally assumed to be the Guoqiang Middle School stadium at the intersection of Cade Road, but the stadium has recently been renovated for the charity basketball and volleyball competition. The charity competition has not yet ended, so it is not convenient to use it immediately. At the same time, because the Summer Basketball Invitational League and the charity basketball and volleyball event organized by the Disaster Relief Children's Home are fundamentally two different organizations, the organizing committee of the league has changed the venue to the Ballroom in Jing'an Temple. Fortunately, the transportation in Jing'an Temple is also very convenient, so it should not make the audience who love to appreciate the highest basketball skills feel the labor of trekking. The four strong teams invited to participate in this Summer Basketball League are all the elite of Shanghai basketball. This year is the first session, and it will be held once a year in the future, so that basketball can have an opportunity to be examined in the summer after the end of the season. The opening program is as follows:</p>
<p>Blue and White vs. All Black 5:45</p>

Since Blue and White defeated Shanghai Star the other day, their edge has been fully revealed. Unnamed has Shu Shi, Liu Qiong, Mei Xi, and Zha Ruigen, and Chen Bangzhen has defected to help, so their strength is also considerable. There will be a tense situation at that time. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Blue and White) Li Zude, Fan Qingxian, Zhang Jinxuan, Bao Songyuan, Qiu Xiaoci, Huang Peijun, Zhang Maozheng,</p>

<h3>Cherishing Genius</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>A friend told me two stories that made me sigh with regret. There was a female classmate who showed outstanding musical talent from a young age. She went smoothly from elementary school to middle school to university to studying abroad in the United States. She was able to specialize in the very things she was good at: piano and violin. Everyone was hoping that she would return to the country after completing her studies and make a significant contribution to music. Unexpectedly, news came that she had a rare cancer in her arm, and the doctor would not allow her to play instruments anymore. As a result, she could only give up music and switch majors.</p>
<p>Another female classmate, who was smart and lively and also showed a bright future, unexpectedly contracted a serious lung disease a few weeks before graduating from university and is now recuperating.</p>
<p>There are not many young Chinese people who are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to receive school education. Among these lucky children who receive education, there are already very few geniuses. Of course, it is even rarer for geniuses to be able to smoothly study at university and study abroad. However, unexpectedly, among these few lucky geniuses, there is a part that has to suffer from the torment of ruthless illness. It can be seen that the success of geniuses in the world is rare and precious.</p>
<p>After seeing this kind of phenomenon of unfortunate fate that makes people sigh, we don't need to be discouraged. We should therefore know how to cherish genius even more. People with good opportunities and talent should also know how to cherish themselves even more.</p>
<h3>The Blessing of the Deaf</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xinliang</p>
<p>In his 1939 report from the otolaryngology research institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States, Dr. Samuel Crowe told us, "If young students can have an examination every year and receive radiation treatment early for the lymphatic tissue around the Eustachian tube, we may be able to reduce the number of deaf people by fifty percent."</p>
<p>This renowned otolaryngology research institute is diligently experimenting with radium to prevent (not cure) deafness. Dr. Crowe and his assistants conducted detailed examinations and tests on 1,500 children aged eight to fourteen. The result is that childhood deafness can be prevented. Adult deafness is different from that of children because the disease only just begins in childhood, and it is not easy to treat deafness until the physical and mental institutions of the body are solid after adulthood.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to scientists and doctors actively preventing deafness early on, we can also see many schools for the deaf. When Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, first opened his "School of Acoustics" at 18 Beacon Street in Boston, he believed that the education of deaf children should begin as early as possible. Today, there are countless schools for the deaf in the United States. Among them, the largest is the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf on Mount Airy outside Philadelphia; local residents generally call it the "Deaf and Dumb Asylum."</p>
<p>In that gray-white building, there are now 537 male and female students studying. Some of them are simply so deaf that they cannot hear any sound at all, and they come here to live and study. Like students who are not deaf, they can receive training in morality, intelligence, and physical education. The school authorities do their best to have them complete the ninth grade in twelve years; after graduation, the school introduces them to jobs.</p>
<p>A famous surgeon named Sir William Wilde of the school once said to others: "For money, people would rather sell their souls; for fame, people would rather sacrifice their lives... But for me, being a teacher of the deaf and dumb is the happiest thing in the world." This shows how sincere the teachers are. With a steadfast, kind, and cheerful heart, they are single-mindedly trying to enable the deaf to acquire the ability to speak and do things as well.</p>
<p>According to them, deaf children mostly know how to study hard. They move up class by class, imitating how the teachers pronounce words with their lips. At the same time, they also learn simple mathematics and how to write letters. After they have a little clue, the school teaches them various practical skills. Boys at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf generally learn printing, woodworking, barbering, and tailoring. Girls learn sewing, washing, cooking, and typing.</p>
<p>Children still have games. According to people in the school, they can all play very well, and they are very fast and accurate when kicking the ball. In addition, they also publish a publication called "Mount Airy World"; whether it is photography, binding, printing, or content, it has extraordinary achievements.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that there is also Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., which is dedicated to deaf students who are intelligent to study advanced knowledge. Currently, there are 160 students in the school. In 1938, Johns Hopkins University awarded a doctorate in philosophy to a student who had been deaf since childhood. Recently, another deaf person also obtained a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard.</p>
<p>"Deaf people are also people," let us keep this sentence in mind and work hard to seek welfare for the deaf!</p>
<h3>Alfalfa</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>— One of Ai Zi's New Interpretations —</p>
<p>The state of Qi was a place where production was not abundant, and coupled with the fact that the King of Qi liked to have fun, the difficulty of the people's lives can be imagined. In the palace of the King of Qi, there were riddle experts Chun Yukun, soccer experts Sun Gu, and reed pipe experts Dong Guo; but outside the palace of the King of Qi, there were men without strength, women without milk, and children without clothes.</p>
<p>Beggars filled the entire state of Qi, and Qi seemed to be turning into a beggar country. Especially in winter, when the weather was so cold and there was no food stored, a large number of poor people trudged through the snow and begged from door to door, which was such a miserable picture!</p>
<p>Hungry people all have angry hearts, but it is only anger. Who dares to utter a complaint in the face of the emperor's iron-like terror? Anger must be expressed, but it must be clever. So they sought out Ai Zi, who worked for the King of Qi, as the target of their anger, because Ai Zi loved to be clever.</p>
<p>Spring has come, the cold is no longer in the world, and some plants are growing sparsely in the fields.</p>
<p>One day, an old man in tattered clothes came to Ai Zi's house; Ai Zi respected the elderly, and hurriedly greeted him, seeing that he was holding a bunch of weeds called alfalfa in his hand.</p>
<p>"Ai Daifu," the old man said, "this new food has just grown in the field, and the old man does not dare to taste it first, so I specially came to offer it to you."</p>
<p>"Oh—" Ai Zi knew that the situation was not right, so he changed to a gentle tone and said, "Then I must thank you, but after I taste it, who will it be the turn of?"</p>
<p>"After offering it to you, I will cut it down for my hungry donkey," the old man said and left.</p>
<p>Ai Zi stayed at the door, thinking in his heart: "Governing Qi must start from the root."</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Photo Letters</h3>
<p>— Sun Si</p>
<p>Soldiers serve on the battlefield for the survival of the country; but soldiers also belong to the people in this society, so they also need people's help. After soldiers are injured, of course, field hospitals are responsible for saving lives and healing injuries, and even those who are not injured also need people's assistance at any time - such as to regulate the boring and tense life, we should let the soldiers have musical entertainment, or picture books and newspapers for recreation, etc... But these are easy things to do. The "photo letters" recently adopted by the British Post Office can be said to be service for soldiers, which has been comprehensive and meticulous.</p>
<p>Recently, British troops who went to the Middle East, Syria, and other places to fight have traveled across the ocean. If they want to send a family letter home by ordinary means and following the sea route, they do not know how many days it will take to reach home. With the ever-changing nature of war now, parents and wives are eager for the safety of those on expeditions. Sending letters by such a circuitous method is truly heart rendering. Therefore, the Post Office came up with the idea of using a paper of a specified format, a letter paper that is eight inches wide and eleven inches long, for soldiers to write on. This letter is photographed on a small negative and transported to the United Kingdom by plane. After the negative is transported to the United Kingdom, it is enlarged and developed, and sent to the soldier's home address.</p>
<p>It is estimated that four thousand small negatives weigh only one pound. If it is four thousand letters, it will weigh at least one hundred and fifty pounds, which of course cannot be transported by plane, but only by circuitous sea transport.</p>
<p>Soldiers who use their flesh and blood to uphold world justice, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, should be loved by their country and society. Therefore, the various facilities designed for their convenience are the rights that soldiers should enjoy, and also the obligations that all levels of society who have not yet gone to the battlefield should fulfill.</p>
<h3>Invisible Glass</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>The American female scientist Dr. Katharine B. Blodgett has now invented a method for manufacturing invisible glass. She covers the glass with a layer of liquid soap that is four millionths of an inch thick, because the reason why glass has a shape is because light is reflected back from its surface. Now that a thin film of soap has been added, there are two reflections. Because the distance is properly matched, the reflection of the soap film, which is four millionths of an inch thick, can exactly cancel out the reflection of the glass, so the shape of the glass is no longer visible.</p>
<p>But this glass has very strong light transmission, and almost ninety-nine percent of the light can pass through. The glass invented by Dr. Blodgett can be used to protect famous paintings in art exhibitions and museums. Other uses include: car windshields, shop windows, display cases, cameras, glasses, and telescopes.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Eleven A Midnight Song</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, I don't want to deliberately make things difficult for you." Shang Laoer suddenly changed his smile and said, "The play must be learned, but the master cannot help but be considerate of you." Then let's do this! In a day or two, you will go to the city to study according to your father's words, and I have to work harder and go with you; I also have a friend over there, and I will stay at his house. We will stipulate a time every day, and you will come out of the school to find me, so your father can be deceived."</p>
<p>"But..." Mei Bao Yi Ran thought of the note that Shang Laoer wanted her father to write.</p>
<p>"Then what else do you have to say?" Of course, Meng Lao, the shopkeeper, always helped his brother-in-law to speak.</p>
<p>"But what about that paper?" Mei Bao asked with all her courage.</p>
<p>This question stumped Meng Lao, the shopkeeper, his son, and even his daughter-in-law. The three of them stared blankly at Shang Laoer, and everyone understood that this most important key could only be decided by himself.</p>
<p>But this matter is completely different from the usual method of apprenticeships in the Pear Garden world. Now, because of Qiuhaitang's opposition, even a note written by the parents cannot be done, which is even further away from the habit; no matter how cunning and flexible Shang Laoer's brain nerves have been tortured by opium, he could not think of any good plan for a while.</p>
<p>"This doesn't matter, it's okay to write it later." He frowned, his two thin and pale triangular eyebrows slowly said, "Really, Mei Bao, you must not listen to other people's words, thinking that I want you to learn opera entirely for my own sake! Fortunately, you are going to enter the city in a day, and the people in the city always see more than the farmers, if you don't believe it, you can ask around yourself and see what they say."

<p>Military Equipment</p>
<h3>Shallow-Water Fast Boat</h3>
<p>— Ke Si</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy authorities, in order to facilitate the transportation of troops, specially built a type of shallow-water fast boat that can climb beaches, built by the Chris factory. It is 30 feet long and can carry 35 soldiers. The speed can reach 35 miles per hour in peacetime, and the speed is also 12 miles per hour when transporting troops. The characteristic of this fast boat is that although the hull is large, the draft is less than six inches, so it can travel freely even near extremely shallow beaches. It is extremely convenient for transporting troops.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Decline of Suzhou Tanchun (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jintao</p>
<p>"It is better to quarrel with a Suzhou person than to talk to a Ningbo person." The reason why Suzhou people's speech is popular is that the tone is "harmonious." In order to achieve harmony in tone, singing operas is naturally more pleasant to the ear. "Qu Yan Pin" says: "Today, Wu Yu is still respected, - Yu is a song - because it is bright and moist, gentle and clear." Indeed, the tunes of Suzhou people's small operas are as harmonious as "pearls are round and jade is moist." Only the unfaithful and unfilial Wu Sangui did not like it very much, saying that it was "why is the sound so sad..." This is probably because martial artists have a violent mood and like loud gongs and drums, which are especially lively; elegant and quiet things are not to their liking.</p>
<p>It is impossible to examine when Suzhou people started singing tanchun. According to the Hang Su Yi Feng: "Tanchun is divided into five people for the roles of male, female, net, and clown, using strings, pipa, huqin, drums, and clappers. The songs are also opera texts, but they are rewritten into seven-character sentences, with five or six episodes per book - meaning several scenes and acts - and there are gongs and drums. Tanchun is popular in Suzhou and Hangzhou..." Its organization, music, and the present are not very different. According to the word tanchun being crowned above, it is thought to be the same as the Yangko opera in Shaoxing opera - to make Shanghai people understand, it can be called Shaoxing Tanchun. "Yangko" was originally farmers complaining in the fields, and sometimes feeling the need for the opposite sex. There were few pedestrians in the fields, so they casually chewed (meaning nonsense). After many unknown pastoral literary writers modified the sentences, they slowly formed songs. Later, they felt it was very interesting, taking advantage of the moonlit nights or rainy times after the busy farming season, turning over rice buckets, gathering a few young guys, and matching them with simple musical instruments and strings, to entertain themselves and others. Suzhou people did not originally sing tanchun in an occupational way. It was amateur in nature, and those engaged in it were all farmers, and that must not be wrong. If you don't believe it, just look through the materials collected in the "Suzhou Tanchun Collection" published in the past few years, and most of them are about the love between rural men and women.</p>
<p>Suzhou has beautiful mountains and rivers, and in the past, it has indeed produced many literati. The "land of culture" is indeed worthy of the name. Because of the development of culture, there are also several farmers who can write articles. Therefore, many of the lyrics of Suzhou Tanchun are very similar to Kunqu opera, and many of the tunes are also transformed from Kunqu opera. Ten years ago, the entertainment industry in Shanghai was not as diverse as it is now. "Comedy" had not yet become independent, and Shenqu opera was not as popular as it is today. Most of the celebratory gatherings were singing Suzhou Tanchun. At that time, Suzhou Tanchun had a considerable amount of good luck.</p>
<h3>Chen Yunshang's Active Posture</h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang is a top screen star in the Shanghai film industry. Recently, she starred in a "New Sisters" at the National Federation. Recently, it was learned from reliable sources that after she completes "New Sisters," she will immediately go to Hong Kong, because the Grand View Company is waiting for her to shoot a new film. It is said that the Grand View Company has been urging her to return to Hong Kong for a long time, but the National Federation authorities insisted on retaining her to shoot "New Sisters," so it has been delayed for a long time. The picture above is a recent photo of Yunshang. (Yan Ciping photo)</p>
<h3>Xin Yanqiu Gets Married</h3>
<p>From then on, there is no singing in the music world</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu recently married a famous scholar in Tianjin. The two have been in love for many years. When Yanqiu was imprisoned in Ping'an the year before last, this gentleman did his best to help her. Because he was grateful for his kindness, he promised himself to him. However, his family has a legal wife, and there seems to be a problem in name. Now the new couple is going to Pingdu for their honeymoon. Yanqiu's possessions have been given away or sold separately. Secretly hidden scripts such as Yujing Taoist, Pipa Xing, and Chun Zuo Xuanxu will be given to the rising Kunling Qin Yumei. Yanqiu will retire from now on.</p>
<h3>Drama Arts Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>Various Ping theaters have decided to close for one day tomorrow to commemorate August 13, and will resume performances on the 14th.</p>

Tianchan officials have internally scheduled the date of his debut to be a week later, and the details of the opening show will be discussed after Hong Nong himself arrives.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Xinfang disbanded Yifeng Society, several basic members such as Wang Lanfang, Liu Yunfang, Li Renjun, Jin Qingkui, and Zhang Yueting are still retained. It is said that his contract with Carlton has not yet expired, so there may be a possibility of reviving after the autumn.</p>
<p>Huang Jinjin Yuansheng and Sun Lanting took the opportunity to go north the day before yesterday. The purpose is to invite Ma Lianliang's troupe to the south, and to investigate the situation of inviting actors in the north. The theater's representative for inviting actors, Ma Zhizhong, will also serve as the manager of Ma Yunliang's troupe.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Yuan Yuan's Small Characters Jiao Luo Qi</p>
<p>She was twelve points unwilling to entertain these guests in her heart, but after all, she was a woman in the brothel. If she ate this bowl of rice, she could not refuse or offend the guests who came to her door, especially the noble person, she could not help but fool him. Therefore, she forced a smile, suppressed her unhappy emotions, and went to deal with them. After sitting down, the old man looked at Yuan Yuan from head to toe, and said, "Yuan Yuan's two words, petite Luo Qi, are extremely fragrant and beautiful. I have long heard of your reputation in Beijing. Today, I came south to sweep the tomb and take a small tour of Lingyan. I didn't expect to meet you suddenly. I have a relationship with you in this life, so I came in the rain to visit your boudoir, and I am willing to enjoy the joy of one night. I believe that you are so intelligent that you will not refuse me." When Yuan Yuan heard the old man call her "Qing" at their first meeting, she thought that the old man did not want her and lowered her head without answering. Hua Butterfly, however, said aside, "Yuan Yuan, do you know who the distinguished guest who came tonight is? This is the Emperor's father-in-law, Tian Hongyu. This time, he came to Jiangnan to sweep the tomb. I and the Emperor's father-in-law have a distant relative relationship, so we traveled together in Lingyan yesterday. As soon as the Emperor's father-in-law saw your charming face, he was surprised to see you as the goddess of Luoshui, which is rare in the world. He repeatedly asked me to find out where your fragrant nest is located. Although it is a drizzling spring rain today, he is very interested in asking me to take him to visit you. Yuan Yuan, you must serve the distinguished guest well." When Yuan Yuan did not answer, Tian Hongyu had already laughed and said, "There is no need to be restrained. We are here with interest, and we must be happy with each other. Don't treat me as a noble person, and if you have this intention, you will lose your interest. Yuan Yuan, do you think what I said is right?" Yuan Yuan said, "What you said is right, sir. It is an honor for the little girl to be favored and driven to the door." Tian Hongyu said, "Good, good, I want to drink a few cups of wine in your boudoir tonight." The few people accompanying him all said that the Emperor's father-in-law was in high spirits, and we should all be happy with him, and we should also make Yuan Yuan lively. Then he ordered the fake mother to prepare wine and dishes quickly. The fake mother naturally obeyed the order and hurried to do it. Tian Hongyu held Yuan Yuan's soft hands in Yuan Yuan's room, and said, "White hair and red face are happy with each other. I have a deep relationship with you." (139)</p>
