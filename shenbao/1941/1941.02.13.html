<p>美總統羅斯福氏，隔昨在新聞記者招待席上答覆記者問話，表示美國縱被迫而加入遠東戰局，然對英之戰具供給不致稍受影響。這雖是半正式的表示，其內容却充滿了新的意義。不久以前，當羅氏向美人籲求援助民治國家的時候，其所持的動聽論據，還只是以可使美國避免戰禍爲援助中英的最大理由；到現在，則已不復諱言美國或有被迫牽入戰局的可能；月所謂戰局，明白指出是遠東方面的戰局：這不僅可見月餘以來的國際局勢業已發展到另一新的階段，而美當局應付時局的決意，亦已非復一味惟恐戰禍波及的畏懼心理所能拘束。</p>
<p>截至屬稿時止，羅氏談話全文尙未傳達上海，而所傳的寥寥二語，却挾有雷霆萬鈞之力，足使風雲變色而有餘。第一，美國對於侵略者挑戰之無所畏憚，自去秋十月初間以來，不惟屢屢有所表示，亦且見之於實際應付，而其公然言及加入戰爭的可能，則實以羅氏隔昨那一談話爲嚆矢。這正如路透社所解釋，是明白表示着「美國在太平洋之海軍，有可以自衛並在太平洋洋中海戰的完全能力一；因此假如遠東局面的發展，證實了和平手段不足以遏止侵略的時候，預料美國將立起應戰而不辭。第二，因爲地理位置的關係，同時應付來自兩洋的攻擊，這原是美國國防上的艱難課題；但是近半年來，因爲英國作戰地位的危而復安，更在中東北非重創了義軍，造成軸心的頹勢，已使美國在大西洋方面遭受威脅的程度大爲减少，而美方對英支援的義務，原僅以充分供給戰具爲已足。最近美國國防工業的調整於增進，已使此一任務的遂行，可不受應付遠東危局的任何影響；另一方面，業就是明白昭示：美國縱使對英擴大增援、却也毫不妨碍其遠東政策的獨立堅定之運用。雖然美國兩洋海軍完成之期尙遠，現在已能充分自由應付大西洋與太平洋雙方的威脅，並已準備應付最惡劣事態的發生。侵略國家一向所用遂行其慾望的兩大法寳，即虛聲恫嚇與各個擊破，早爲各國所識破，而這次羅斯福氏的堅決表示，更證明了法寶的旣被破法。</p>
<p>三國盟約的締結，無論其當事人如何掩飾解說，總無法否認其主要用意在對付美國；針對着美國地跨兩洋的地理弱點，企圖以同盟國的呼應動作加以牽制，俾使美國對於亞歐雙方無法兼顧。這一企圖，假如在締盟之初，三國能夠立以迅速步驟共採攻勢，則美方事先旣乏充分準備，又屆大選關頭，應付自感困難，也許侵略陣綫會有一獲逞的可能。但是由於同盟國先天的弱點與互相利用的存心，彼此觀望推諉，誰也不肯冒着重大犧牲，爲其同盟者先盡火中取栗的任務；這一情態，日本當局在去冬的屢次表現之中，尤爲顯明。但是美國因此一問題而激起的强烈反應，並不因松岡的辭令或野村的友誼而有所遲疑動搖，却繼續以其劍及屨及的精神從事積極運用。及至同盟國看到一切其他企圖均歸無效，而重謀乞靈於盟約條款以謀牽制美國，則已事異情遷；羅氏這一談話，正是告訴他們這種牽制企圖業已失却了最後的時效，即使戰禍眞因爲同盟國的策動而擴大到太平洋，美國將毫不遲疑的舉起她的劍，而援英計畫則斷不受到任何阻礙，其唯一的小幸結果，至多只是南太平洋的遭逢戰禍與日本的自貽伊戚而已。</p>
<p>這種情形，即在日本當局，似亦非毫不理會；故有時而表示不惜一戰，有時而不願冒戰事危險，閃爍迷離，令人莫窮究竟，固屬一種對外姿態的運用，却也不能盡掩其內心的憂疑與矛盾。以日方的政策傳統與此際處境而言，自然只圖不勞而獲，斷難從井救人。其右翼的軍人政客之高唱結託德義敵對英美者，無非都是建立在淺薄的功利見地上而以德義必勝爲其主要前提：假如必須打硬仗，冒大險，前途諸在不可知之數，則可斷言其南進呼聲斷不至如此之高唱入雲。野村的使美，固懷有延宕美方步驟的用意，另一方面，未嘗不是利用野村在美國人士間的私人交誼，及其海軍軍人的條件，以求確定美方眞意及軍事虛實，這正與另一陸軍軍人建川之同時出使蘇聯同樣非出偶然。據說羅斯福氏緊接這一談話之後，更將向其新蒞美的一老友一以明白堅定的方式，說明美國的立塲，預料只要對方未至理智全失，當不致把這些警告完全視同等閒。</p>

<p>這時候遠東方面又有，重要的發展·一九三九年春間日本對鎖天津英租界，英法都有對日妥協的意思。總統和赫爾原已老慮廢止美日商約，抵制日本貿易，箱使日本軍人感到軍火來源斷絕的威脅·赫爾當即與參議院外交委員會秘密商議，決定由參議員范登堡提出廢止商約的動議案，此舉出讀孤立派領袖人物，正是總統和　爾求之不得。該商約就在七月梢宣吿廢止了。</p>
<p>一九三九年八月，希特勒集中大軍，準備進攻波蘭，英法已向波關，羅馬尼亞及土耳其提供保證，願予援助英法與蘇聯的談判則已瀕於流產的坡後階段。戰爭一觸即發。美國方面，因軍火禁令尙未廢止，說話缺乏聲勢，但總統和威兩斯商議結果，決爲和平作最後一次的呼籲·預定致電義大利國王愛麥虞限三世，請其斡旋和平。</p>
<p>約在八月一日至五日之間，德國駐蘇聯大使舒倫堡示意蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫，謂希特勒準備奧蘇聯談判德蘇條約。這消息傳到國務院的時候，總統已離華盛頓，到紐約海穗公園鎮休假。</p>
<p>其他國家聽到這個消息，無不大爲驚詫。但美國自一九三四年以來，早已接有警吿，發出警吿的就是美國駐法大使蒲立德。英法雖也接有同樣警吿，却總不信它眞會實現。實則演在穗國淸黨運動以後，史太林早已向希特勒建議合夥攻擊西歐各國，當時希特勒因畏懼英國，且還沒有放棄東進的計劃故表示拒絕。不過兩國對於此事的談判，絕未閒斷，時時經由特別外交途徑及在商務代表團與雙方軍事當局之間，互相接觸。</p>
<p>溯在一九三九年初，希特勒因外交部長李本特洛浦的慫患及英國政策的軟弱，對英態度乃大改變，蘇德秘密談判隨之轉入新階段。五月間，蘇聯以莫洛托夫繼李維諾夫爲外交委員長，英國和波蘭成立臨時協定，希特勒便訓令舒倫堡大使通知莫洛托夫，謂德國與日本義大利所訂的反共協定，並無什麼意義，英國乃是蘇德共同的敵人，蘇德兩國應該在貿易及其他方面，增進關係。希特勒的本意但願蘇聯置身於英法波三國聯合陣綫以外，不料莫洛托夫的答覆竟主張在增進貿易關係之外，更須增進政治的關係，舒倫堡驟聞此言，覺出乎意外。</p>
<p>德蘇旋即開始談判商務協定，但希特勒仍希望蘭對於但澤問題，表示屈服，俾利用「波蘭走廊」，進攻蘇聯的烏克蘭。莫洛托夫的建議一時未得切實的反應，正在力促舒倫堡答覆的時候，史太林却命國防委員長伏羅希洛夫，與英法討論反德陣錢。稍後但澤問題陷於僵局，希特勒知道波蘭不可屈服，對蘇談判乃急轉直下。</p>
<p>英法對於此事，也和美國國務院一樣，接到同樣的情報，但英一駐蘇大使西慈和法國駐蘇大使那齊雅都不以蘇德勾結　可能，他們深信伏羅希洛失那種響亮而誠懇的主張（伏羅希洛夫也完全不知道史太林和莫洛托夫暗中所玩的把戲）·當時只有中國得着消息之後，即見機而行。中國行政院長蔣介石所派私人代表於八月八日飛抵巴黎，訪晤美國駐法大使蒲立德，獲得密報，當即電述重慶，蔣院長接到此項電報，再參酌行政院幾位部長的意見後，便將蘇聯所要求締結某糧條約，婉詞予以拒絕。到了八月十六日，伏羅希洛夫暗示英法代表，只耍波蘭允許蘇聯一部份軍隊開入境內，蘇聯就可以加入他們的陣綫，與德國相抗。他不知道就在這天，舒倫堡和莫洛托夫已將蘇德條約的文字全部商妥了。</p>
<p>一九三九年九月一日黎明，總統給巴黎報吿德軍侵入波蘭的無綫電話喚醒，捻亮電燈，撐起身來，倚在枕上，燃着一支捲烟，就分別打電話給赫爾·威爾斯·陸軍部長伍特林及海軍部長愛迪遜，通知這個警訊。伍特林和愛迪遜也分別通知陸軍參謀長馬歇爾和海軍參謀長史帶克，立刻用無綫電報傳令太平洋與大西洋的各艦隊及自南太平洋薩馬亞島以至麻州台文斯要塞陸軍部隊。</p>
<p>赫爾和威爾斯都忽忽起身，趕到國務院，不多一會，國務院幫辦裴爾，歐洲司長摩法等也陸續趕到。實際上他們這時除守候電報外，原是無事可辦，大部份時間都是圍着赫爾的辦公桌呆坐着，無意義的討論戰爭，彷彿送殯的人悼惜死者一樣，只有裴爾慨然歎道，「我們守候歐洲死亡，可說已經守出頭了。」</p>
<p>總統却自在得很，通知完畢之後，又呼呼入睡、直到六時半，駐法大使蒲立德發來第二次無綫電話，再把他叫醒。蒲立德在短短的時間內，已和法總理達拉第晤談，達拉第聽天由命的說，他早已聲明英法必須援助波蘭，否則無以立國，且須失去抵抗國社黨勢力仲展的最後機會。蒲立德並報吿總統，英法一定參戰。這種消息，旁人聽了當然意亂如麻，總統却不慌不忙，又小睡四十五分鐘，直到駐英大使甘納第從倫敦打來電話，纔第三次把他攪醒。甘納第報吿與英國首相張伯倫會談經過，性質與湝立德和達拉第所談的無異，但但甘納第語氣極爲悲觀，至此，總統不再打算睡了，便喚僕人預備早餐，並在床上把全般局勢統盤籌劃了一個鐘頭。</p>
<p>總統的籌劃還沒定當，戚爾斯已闖進臥室，和總統舉行床邊會議，當即決定，一俟英法對德宣戰，立刻召開汎美洲特2［J會議，總統主張在美洲各國領海昆連海面，劃出安全區域，由美國艦隊實行「中立性的巡戈，」藉使整個西半球不受海戰影響。威雨斯退出後，總統即命愛迪遜草擬計劃。</p>
<p>這時總統披衣起床。走入辦公室，會見各報訪員。稍後赫爾也到了，他們便分別和駐英駐法大使駐波蘭公使及駐德代辦通無綫電話。他們覺得戰爭旣已爆發，人心震恐，修改中立法，廢止其中禁運軍火前往交戰國條款，以便援助民治國，必可獲得大多數人的擁護，但必須待輿論成熟，方可召集國會特別會議。</p>
<p>九月三日星期日淸晨四時許，總統床上的電話父響起來了。甘納第大使將張伯倫宣戰的演說稿要旨，報吿總統，這個演說稿是在發表前兩小時交給甘納第的。甘納第大使感情極易衝動，此時傷心已極，不斷的說着，「這世界完了，一切都完了。」</p>
<p>但總統並不同甘納第一般的感情用事，竭力在電話中撫慰他一番，於是總統又用電話叫醒各閣員，涌知戰爭的新發展。總統稍睡片刻，提早起床，預備他的廣播演說。威爾斯晨間已把召集汎美洲特別會議的通知單發出。他在十一時許到白宮把汎美會議議程和安全區域範圍呈總統覆核。這圖劃定西半球四周海面一百芡里爲安全區，但總統不以爲然，親自用了戒尺，重新劃分，把安全區範匯擴大爲平均三百英里，並將界綫拉直。</p>
<p>下午二時半，總統在白宮林肯書齋宣讀廣播演說，赫爾，威爾斯，裴爾等人，圍繞總統而坐。總統的演詞大意說，美國當守中立，中立法未修正前仍屬有效，外國的宣傳須予杜防，南北美洲各國務須促其團結。他又鄭重地說，一我希望美國不致捲入此次戰爭漩渦，並信我們定可做到。」</p>
<p>九月初頭一番騷動的局面，至此吿一段落。此後，總統和赫爾等人仍努力進行修改中立法，第一步廢止軍火禁令，第二步設法援助民治國，抵抗侵略。（完）</p>

<p>字林西報云：宋子文博士，一月二十三日，在紐約中國學會發表演說，對於日軍在中日戰爭中所遭遇之困難，多所論列。據宋氏之意見，中國廣大之地區與潛在之人力，將使侵略者無從施行其閃電戰術，其初對方雖希望於數月內蹂躪全中國，但此項計劃，卒成泡影。以下爲未氏演詞之摘要。</p>
<p>約七年前，在余赴倫敦出席經濟會議之途中，對於日軍攫取滿洲之問題，曾向諸君有所論述，當時余曾謂滿洲問題，雖在者干人視爲並非急切之問題，但此爲若干年來第一次之國際掠奪行爲，若不加以譴責，其影嚮所及，勢將造成爲其他各處同樣不法行爲之前例，直至全世界捲入普通之大火中。後抵倫教時，余以同樣之情緒，向下議院援華委員會演說，當時由外相西門爵士任主席。余曾引述英國文舉家麥考來之歷史論文一段，該文描寫歐洲經多年之和平後，大腓德立如何由奧大利攫取薛爾西亞一地，因而引起「七年戰爭」，戰禍蔓延，幾遍全世界。又「黑人於刊羅曼台爾沿海相鬥，紅人於北　洲之大湖邊互相殘段一。當吾人目見今日之世界　於　　烽火中。</p>
<p>深慶中國　領袖得人</p>
<p>余在七年　所述者，果不幸而言中，此固非令人滿意之事。但憶及當時余所發表之第二層意見，即日本之侵略，將成爲鍛鍊中國統一之鐵錘，及中國將以血肉與物質損失之代價，覓得國魂一節，亦已證實，此則令人深感滿意者。中國在民族生命最高之危機中，得有如蔣介石將軍者領導一切，實爲幸事。在希特勒墨索里尼與近衛結合下，吾人得有邱吉爾與蔣介石將軍爲傑出之領袖，並有偉大人物如羅斯福者爲之後援，此實爲民治國家之幸。吾人往往以爲蔣介石將軍僅一軍人而已，其實蔣氏不但爲一軍人，且亦爲一政治家，對於戰爭中錯綜複雜之因素；以及其中各種政治與物質之動力，瞭如指掌。吾人必須注意，與其稱蔣氏爲軍人，不如稱其爲政治家，蔣氏與日本軍閥逈然不同，蓋蔣氏不以戰爭爲手段，以期逢到政治家所懷之目的也。</p>
<p>日本侵略　輕舉妄動</p>
<p>一九三七年，當日本對華發動戰爭之時，實爲日本之輕舉妄動。當時近衛對某本國人民及外報記者稱，三月後將使中國屈膝，其意所指，蓋即目今一般所稱之「閃電戰」，但日人祗知有已而不知有人，吾人深知時間一點，有利於中國。時問將使日人之資源竭蹶，蓋日人爲維持其世界第三位之最人海軍，以及在戰爭狀態下數百萬軍隊與數千架飛機之供給，其資源之易吿竭蹶，不言而喻。中國民族欲發揮其龐大堅實之力量，自必須經相當之時間，且時問能使各民治國家明瞭中國之作戰，不僅爲自身之利益，亦且爲各民治國家之共同利益；民治國家有此醒覺，自將欣然援助中國。</p>
<p>無法控制　淪陷區域</p>
<p>今日諸若如果翻閱中國地圖，將見巨大之醜形，即一般所稱之日軍佔領區，但日人佔領此等土地，僅爲表面上之狀熊。各大城市雖爲日人所據，但距城不數里以外之土地，仍在中國政府之手中，由中國政府征收賦稅，流通貨幣，發號施令，以及判理訟案。同時日人雖佔領鐵路及一部份惠要之公路，但路之兩旁，均駐有華軍興游舉隊，不時破壞橋樑，拆毀路軌，及埋伏殲滅日軍最遠之前哨。西部達於宜昌，但上海，南京，北平等處，僅數哩外即華方正規軍數帥。</p>
<p>南進野心　有如一夢</p>
<p>最近軸心國家所訂劃分勢力範圍之協定，寳寫一四九三年西班牙與葡萄牙瓜分世界之企圖。日本分配所得之目的物，區域甚廣，包括中國及南太平洋諸地，如越南，馮來，東印度，暹暹，緬甸，印度以及澳洲與紐西蘭，此誠如貪婪之黃金夢。但日本旣禾到手，甚至如星加坡之砲壘，亦未被攻下，該埠若無英國之主力艦隊，而僅賴澳洲與荷蘭兩國之海軍分隊以爲保術，自非日本全部海空軍並以陸軍爲後援之敵手。如一旦進攻星加坡，當然須顧及美國龐大可畏之戰鬥艦隊，但在日本之意嚮，以爲港與其軸心伙伴進攻英國，直布雜陀與蘇伊士之時，同時發動進攻星加坡，使大西洋之危機加重，則美國或將對星加坡袖手旁觀。日本之艦隊與空軍，雖尙完整，但其陸軍已不足以支持及鞏固一巨大之南進計劃。</p>
<p>屢次求和　係一詭謀</p>
<p>據中立國　陸軍操威力面之估計，日軍在華戰死病死以及永久殘廢者，其數當在一百十萬人以上。此外，尙有一百二一五萬軍隊被牽制中國，至在滿洲防備蘇聯之日軍，尙未計算在內。故軍事學專家之意見，日本國內因出征軍人有去無還，對於新冒險，遂甚少鼓勵。（未完）</p>

<p>自由談家庭男子漢  石子　　祖父死了，還沒到一月、父親同四叔父爲日賬務問題，起了口角。　　「你敢說你沒有得着好處嗎？那隻洋箱爲什麽變成了空的？」四叔父惡狠狠地說。　　「天知道，要誰暗下得着了好處，天雷擊的·」父親也不示弱，報復地說：「你可不耍强舌，房裏一只盛放契券戶摺的小提篋，會不翼而飛嗎？」　　祇有五叔父一向是個抱一多吃飯，少管事一主義的，所以任何爭鬧的漩渦，總不能把他也捲進；但他也決不頤守份，他常常站在旁邊，冷言冷語的東敲一下，西擊一下，等到人家的槍尖，對準了他，他又俏皮的溜開了。這次爲了管理賬務的事情，引起了四叔父同父親的口角，五叔父同着已寡的大伯母，三叔母，都在一旁；也不知是解勸，還是煽惑，五叔父回大伯母三叔母都不約而同的說：　　「算了吧，我們是吃虧定了，也沒得說什麽？」　　父親沒說什麽，轉是四叔母趕着報復：　　「誰得了好處？天雷　的」，四叔母想想似乎太可氣，於是索性提高了聲音，「亂嚼舌根的，不得好死，要斷種絕代的：」　　這話刺了沒有兒子的大伯母及五叔母的心，於是廳堂內混是一片女人的聲音，鬧成一團。　　母親病着，她睡房就是廳堂的間壁，所以廳堂中的吵鬧，都聽得淸楚；她嘆了一口氣，對着我說：　　「唉！先人屍骨未寒，就鬧到如此地步，你祖父生得如此好兒子，娶得如此好媳婦」　　第二天廳堂中，破例地冷淸了；賬桌上亂疊着賬册。昨天吵鬧的伯母們叔母們，也祇緊在外廊下，又似乎和衷共濟地聚在一堂，討論着賬務事情：父親同四叔父反了目，二個都不肯管理；五叔父素來閒散慣的，除了釣魚，打鳥外，根本不懂理賬的方法，自然也祇能擠在伯母，叔母羣中開會·在伯母叔母羣中頂　幹的，就是四叔母，她時以最高的喉嚨摻在其中。　　「把賬務擱着，儘管自己人吵鬧，這終不感話呀！大家得想個辦法，趕速把賬務理淸楚，就按房攤派，我眞是等着錢用呢：這樣的你也不管，我也不管，倒叫我看着白飯餓肚皮不成？……」　　不等四叔母說完，三叔母也接了上來：「怎不是嗎？我的姊姊聽說爺爺死了，就寫信來向我討取欠她的債洋二千元，欠着人家多討厭，攤分了也好敎我還債」。　　上伯母也說　着錢用，因爲她女兒在中學裹的用　很大，於是大家同了一顆「等錢用」的心，就你一句她一句地討論着，終究定了一個主意出來。　　四叔母提高着喉嚨，作了個結東：「不再管他們男子漢這樣那樣的，民國世界，我們女人也得作主意了。準定去城內請1個律師來，苒僱一個賬房淸理賬日，這樣憑着公正人，決不會有厚此薄彼的，對嗎？」「對的，明天呌划船去請×律師」　　大家都同意了，一塲會議就此結束。　　祖父生前會做過鄉長，鄉下人都異服他，甚至連小孩子，見了祖父，也會躡手躡脚的不敢吵鬧？鄉下凡有糾紛事件，差不多都來祖父面前，求祖父一言爲決。因此祖父在世的時候，家裏的客人，永沒間斷過。但是自祖父死後，家鬥口除了隔隣的所蓄的小鴹，偶而躍了進來，除此以外，簡直沒有一個人進出。父親同四叔父，先忙於反目吵架，後又忙於賭博，伯母叔母等又忙於分床桌，椅，木板，錫箔灰，因此，沒有人覺得這一個鏡頭的特殊轉變，祇有我，受悶於充滿戰氛的家庭中，覺得很不舒服，就想跑到街上去散步。　　街上差不多都在談着我家情形，看見了我，都投我以神秘的眼光，刺地低聲談論着　　「你如道他爲什麽從上海回來的？」　　「因爲他祖父死了！」　　「那裏？他祖父已出了裏，他才趕到呢！」　　「那是交通的關係。」　　「不是的，老實吿訴你，他回家來，就是幫助他父親來分財產的·」　　「哦！」　　「你知道他父親是嗜睹若命的，人又是老實的，難保不在分財產h吃虧；因此他趕回來，終究是個大學生，幹事一定能幹的，你看着罷，便宜一定是他的。」　　「哦……哦哦！」　　男一堆人在我背後指着我，也在月旦。　　「好了，蓋叫天到了！這準是全武行的好戲了。」　　「你是說他嗎？」　　「是呀，你想他家的伯母，叔母，都是鄉裏著名的雌老虎，辦起事比男子漢都幹練，聽說×店王一死，臥房裏的東西，就你搶我奪的拿了個精光。以後七期中，也都忙着順手牽羊的勾當，差不多天天都爲爭多爭少而吵嘴。如今他來了，這戲一定更鬧得大了。」　　「你怎會知道？」　　「不信嗎？好，你等着熊吧，」　　我忍不住人家的指談，加緊了脚步，跑回家去；一跨進門口，又聽見四叔母的聲音：　　「還少一隻缸，誰藏着？快些拿出來！偷着可不得好報的！」玻璃碎的速度  靜　　大家都知道玻璃碎起來是非常快的。玻璃窗跌在地上，「乓浪」一響，這當然碎得非常快；就是平常一顆子彈打在玻璃上，這玻璃也會很快地破碎。不過玻璃究竟碎得怎樣的快呢？美國的科學家曾用很好的照相機，把子彈經過玻璃的一刹那間的情形，拍了出來。他們研究的結果，發覺玻璃碎的速度是每秒鐘一英里。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　胡督軍是軍人中較工心計的一個，他熊袁實藩這樣指手劃脚的胡鬧，已引起了許多人的注意，實在太不成話了，便忙着把身子向他靠近一些，爽快對症發葉的送了他一顆定心丸。　　「老兄弟，這有什麽急的？你心裏想的事都有辦法，現在還是安靜一些，待俺回去之後，一定給你出主意！」胡督軍用極低的聲音，湊在袁寶藩那顆幾十斤重的大腦袋邊說。　　他倒不是存心哄騙他，當天下午，他就在雅片烟舖的旁邊，接見了馬敎育廳　，開始給袁寳落辦起正事來。　　「可是……可是……」馬爲長聽胡督軍說完了一篇鬼話，便用手捻着臀上一簇準東洋化的短髭，遲疑不決地說：「兄弟前年在京裹就聽人家說，袁鎮守使府上已有了好幾位太太，怎麽說不曾娶過呢？」　　胡督軍還不曾回答，袁寳藩自己開口了。　　「那兒來的話！」他因爲正有事要求敎人家，便顯得毫無架子地堆着笑說：「老兄別纒錯了門子！我可以給你發誓：誰娶過老婆，誰就是忘八蛋！」　　說得馬廳長幾乎大笑起來，尤其是早知道他家裏已有　妻二妾的胡督軍，更有非笑不可的困難。　　「老袁想娶個女學生，連忘八蛋也顧不得了！馬大哥，還有什麼說的，快成全了他吧。」　　袁寳藩也不想老胡這話是存心駡他，聽了反喀嘻哈哈的裂開着一張人嘴儘笑。　　現在馬廳長却沒有工夫再笑了，他的腦神經已得開始　轉起來，因爲這到於他的親戚侯校長，果然是一個相當困難的題目；但近來汪省長對他所發生的一些誤會，已使馬廳長的綠位有了不穩的現象，耍設法挽救，胡督軍當然是一位大力王菩薩。難得胡督軍爲了袁寳藩的事，先來求敎自已，這樣好的機會，如何能够輕輕放過呢？　　「我的地位不保，侯老表姐的校長也就不用想冉做下去；爲了兩個人的祿位，即使題目再難一些，也得硬着頭皮把它答應下來。」馬廳長這麽一想，便不再推辭了。　（二九）</p>

<p>游藝界卓別麟拒絕膺獎  斯華　　「余之成功乃演員努力之結果」　六年來拒絕「影協」評判第一人　　紐約市影評人協會每年例有評選最佳影片及男女演員之舉，根據紐約時報的記載，一九四〇年最佳男性演員爲「大獨裁者」的製片人編劇人導演及主角却利卓別麟氏。這次評選係在去年十二月二十九日由全紐約影評人舉行，卓氏得票三分之二，遂獲得首選，其餘得票最多的男星則爲詹姆史都華與湯麥斯密契爾。最近在紐約市「虹室」影評人年會中舉行給獎典禮，影壇名人咸集，頗極一時之盛。　　卓氏接得膺獎通知後，默無表示，直到年會前夜，紐約時報影評人，紐約影評人協會主席包士萊才接到卓氏自Waldorf－Astoriaa寓所拍來的回電：「包士萊先生閣下：遲延作覆，請加原宥，承選爲一九四〇年最佳演員，十分榮幸近日正百般沉思如何報命，方能使各位不致爲難。按照事理，余得諸演員之助力爲多，故不能單獨膺獎。余製片時，竭力思如何使觀衆滿意，幸未失敗，然此係演員們努力之結果，其功不全在余。紐約影評人集團所賜殊獎，實愧於接受，而閣下等對，影各方面之扶掖指導，余實寄無限之期望與至高之崇仰。愚見以爲貴會之評選不無貨緣之處，而離正確之評價甚遠，余不敢掠他人之美，妄自膺獎，並表謝忱。却利卓別麟啟。」包士萊及其他影評人對卓氏的決定表示無限遺憾，去甯吿知彼之來電原文將在給獎之日於國家廣播電台中對衆宣讀，藉致敬意。　　影評人協會自有評獎以來，六年內被拒絕膺獎者尙係第一次。一九三八年時，葛雷泰嘉寳入選，她僅拒絕在給獎典禮對衆播音，而欣然接獎。　　此次給獎典禮中，曾有偉大空氣節目，最佳外國影片，法國出品之「The　Baker’s　Wife」，其輸入代理人勞勃漢津，膺特獎的卡通專家華脫狄斯耐，最佳導演約翰福特，以上三人係從好萊塢當地廣播；最佳女演員「菲城故事」主角凱塞玲赫本遠在德克塞司州，亦從當地播演；全美一九四〇年最佳影片「The　Grapes　Of　The　Wrath」（怒火之花）之製片人丹紐爾柴紐克特從好萊塢飛往紐約參加給獎大典。　　「怒火之花」最後一幕之劇情則由主角享利方達與零黛慧兒在好萊塢同時播演。卓別麟亭名甚早，擁雄厚之資金，憑特出之才藝，稱霸影壇，自不必斤斤於膺獎，而樂得拱手讓人，顯出－代笑匠的風度。荀慧生之我見  靜英　　不久將出演於黃金之荀慧生，本是梆子花且，藝名白牡丹，後以梆子沒落，乃改弦易轍而習皮簧，始易今名。自易名迄今，其中可分爲四個時期。第一是努力靑衣時期，從吳菱仙研究腔調，向王瑤卿學白口身段，「二進宮」「寳蓮燈」「金榜樂」「母女會」皆常貼。「二進宮」之腔全宗時小福；「寳迷燈」之神　力學王瑤卿；「金榜樂」雨後三滑步爲梅程尙所不及；「母女會」神態尤佳，曾與襲靈甫合演於錢府堂會，內行皆稱譽之。第二是翻古本時期，「花田錯」以昇平署本寫藍本編成「花田八錯」；「玉堂春」由嫖院起；「英傑烈」由茶館起；「得　緣」帶歸田；「十三妹」帶洞房；「虹霓關」仍存洞房；「辛安驛」編成全部，改名「金鐘單」；將崑本「盤絲洞」加添塲子；又將「破洪州」「蘆花河」「金光陣」三戲聯成爲一，定名全本「金光陣」；並編有「元宵謎」「　零淚」「丹靑引」「　國夫人」（即續襦記）「西湖主」「香　帶」「妒婦訣」新　，皆出自鄭劍西陳墨香等手筆。第三是改變作風之期，此時坤角輩出，廢蹺　盛，慧生內體肥，隨潮流而讃同廢蹺，每演上蹺戲，或廢蹺，或改紮改良蹺，別人唱全部「紅鬃烈馬」，除「大登殿」扮化戰外，皆飾王寳川，惟慧生獨演「趕三關」「銀空山」之代戰。「虹霓關」他伶皆前東方氏，後丫嬛，慧生後來由一人扮東方氏到底，思春與洞塲二塲，賽如看一齣「戰宛城」。第四是名利雙收不斤斤於鬻藝的時期，因生活安定，體肥日增，時與厭棄紅氍毺上生活，除津沽因與北平相離非遠外，對於外埠相邀，皆婉言謝絕，即在平亦深居簡出，每次出臺，上座反因此特好。　　荀之新劇，似比梅程尙爲多，除早年所編外，後編有「荀灌娘」「杜十娘」「西湖主」「江天雪」「紅梨記」「至孝圖」「竊兵符」「釵頭鳳」「魚藻宮」「還珠吟」「埋香幻」「荊釵記」「柳如是」「庚娘傳」「一丈靑」「明妃」「東吳女丈夫」「實桂娘」「孫策招親」「流民圖」「張金奇」「香祖樓」「賽金花」「紅樓二尤」「紫玉欽」「紅娘」等三四十齣，其中最具號召力是「釵頭鳳」「玉堂春」「十三妹」。　（明日續完）劇藝新聞  何途　　遠征菲列濱的滬星國劇團，盛傳即將返申，昨天該團上海辦事處主任戚少英已經接到團長戚厚卿的來電報吿，於昨日乘輪首途返國，在十八號可以抵達上海。　　靑年伶人李羣到了桂林，記者接到他的來信，裏面有一段涉及歐陽予倩，原文說：「歐陽予倩先生已見着了，他說近來編了幾個戲，大概預備排演，不過是關於桂劇和話劇的，却沒有平劇的，因爲這裏平劇演員，都有很好收入，就不願再作改革運動，我看歐陽先生對於平劇很消極的。」　　更新無台主角張翼鵬，將自廢曆二月份起排演頭本「新西遊記」，不過不是魏如晦編的，是將舊本子加以修改，用新頴的佈景綵頭，改換觀衆的耳目。　　裴冲寫的「甘鳳池」已經寫好一大部份，近來因爲翼罵先演「新西遊記」，他就將「甘鳳池」暫時擱起來，趕寫一個時裝的話劇本子。棋苑  莆田連學正編　　第二五三局　五路進兵　　秦永耀擬　　「玉總難緊」着法列下（紅先勝）　　車一進四　車七退七　車一平三　車七退五　馬二進三　　兵四進一　帥五平六　馬一退三　車一平六　砲一平四　　車六進三　馬三進四　砲九平六　馬四進六　卒七平六　　馬六進四　卒六進一　馬一進二　帥六平五　車七平九　　卒六進一　馬二退四　卒五平六　（勝）</p>

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt declared yesterday in an executive press conference that if the United States were to engage in war in the Pacific, the return of Wilkie, who had been transporting American military supplies to Britain, would not be affected. When a reporter asked the President when he would accept the credentials of the new Japanese Ambassador to the United States, the President replied that Ambassador Nomura would visit the White House on Wednesday or Thursday. A reporter asked, "Does the President also believe that there is a risk of war in the Pacific?" The President replied, "No," but declined to elaborate further. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Wilkie began a conversation with President Roosevelt after 10:00 PM last night, lasting ninety minutes. Afterwards, he told reporters, "We discussed many things, and we also discussed national defense production." When a reporter asked about rumors that Wilkie might decline a position in defense production, he replied, "Absolutely not." He further stated that his conversation with Roosevelt was very sincere and smooth. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt, in an executive press conference yesterday, answered a question that many people have had in their minds for a long time with a very thoughtful attitude, stating that even if the United States were forced to join the war in the Far East, the supply of war materials to Britain would not be affected in the slightest. The President continued with a firm attitude, unwilling to answer speculative follow-up questions in detail, but judging from his answers to these follow-up questions, the United States Navy in the Pacific has the full ability to defend itself and engage in naval battles. American industry is also able to continue to produce goods. Regarding the Japanese Ambassador Nomura, when a reporter asked when Nomura would present his credentials, the President replied that he believed that he could present his credentials today (i.e., Wednesday) and said, "He is an old friend of mine, as you all know." Although official circles have not expressed anything, the general public believes that the President may intend to explain the position of the United States to his old friend in a clear and resolute manner. Coupled with the failure of the Axis powers in Europe and the psychological and strategic progress of Britain's position in the war, this clear explanation from the President should influence even the most frivolous and arrogant elements in Tokyo. At the same time, the fact that British bombers are flying from Singapore to northern Malaya is also a matter of great concern to Washington. The Japanese side points out that this is a kind of nervous reaction by the British authorities to defend Singapore in preparation for future disasters. However, many people believe that this statement by the Japanese side appropriately expresses the nervous anxiety that Tokyo already has. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Roosevelt's speech yesterday regarding the possibility of the United States being drawn into war in the Far East is considered by diplomatic observers here to be the most important statement he has made in recent weeks. Although the President warned reporters not to speculate wildly, general observers acknowledge that the President's words have their own importance. In answering inquiries, the President stated that if the United States were to engage in war in the Pacific, the export of American military supplies to Britain would still not be affected. Observers consider this statement noteworthy for the following reasons: (1) American factories and shipyards will still be able to continue working hard to produce military supplies for Britain when the United States participates in the war in the Far East. (2) Based on the above reasons, many believe that the United States will believe that it can conduct the war in the Far East entirely through the use of the Navy. (3) If the Navy is the main instrument of war in the Far East, then this war will undoubtedly be an economic war of blockade. (4) Many believe that President Roosevelt does not want the United States to be the leader in the war in the Far East unless Japan excessively infringes upon American interests in that area, and then he will take this step. Many believe that the President made this firm statement for two reasons: first, the question came from a reporter from a newspaper affiliated with Secretary of the Navy Knox; second, he wanted the newspaper to publish this statement to reach the ears of the leaders of the Japanese government, because the leaders of Japan are the ones who will decide whether Japan will attack Singapore or the Dutch East Indies at the same time that Germany attacks Britain.

<p>London – Hitler is now trying hard to drag Japan into the war in order to relieve the pressure on the German side caused by the collapse of the United States. People in London are closely watching this. What the German side is plotting is a sudden invasion of Britain in the spring, while Japan invades the Dutch East Indies and Malaya, so as to contain the British fleet and resources. Many believe that Hitler, in order to induce Japan to pull chestnuts out of the fire for him, has promised Tokyo that he can persuade Moscow to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, so that Japan can avoid worries about its rear when it begins operations in the South Seas. A small number of extremely pro-Axis elements in Japan will undoubtedly support Hitler, but people here believe that the sentiment among knowledgeable Japanese people against Japan continuing to take adventurous actions for the sake of the Nazis is becoming increasingly strong, because once the German side's own goals are achieved, it will disregard Japan's situation.

<h3 id="e3">Wilkie Asks All of America to Unite, Rapidly Implement the Lend-Lease Act, Testifies Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Isolation Will Destroy Freedom and Cause Economic Panic, Agrees That Aid Should Be Limited to Britain, China, and Greece <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington – Former Republican presidential candidate Wilkie stated his views to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that Britain needs both immediate and long-term aid. The only way the United States can aid Britain is to implement the Lend-Lease Act with amendments. What he calls immediate aid is, for example, that the United States should supply Britain with five to ten destroyers per month. We should be able to handle this in a direct and rapid manner and should not engage in dubious lawyerly interpretations. If we want to provide Britain with more destroyers, we should equip them in our own shipyards. I advocate that the aid proposed by the United States should be limited to Britain, China, and Greece. I am certain that an isolationist policy will eventually destroy America's civil liberties and cause economic panic. Even if Britain obtains American aircraft, it will still take some time to gain air superiority. If American aid is insufficient, then Britain may fail. I also agree with the time limit added to the President's power by the House amendment. I believe that the amendment should aim to limit the unnecessary powers granted by this bill. I want to see the American people united before the world as enemies of those who strive to destroy democracy. For the sake of national unity, I urge those who oppose this bill to support it. If so, the agreement of the millions of people they represent will surely give the nation a united strength. This strength is greater than the strength of arms and warships. Although Britain has already obtained fifty American destroyers, it still needs more destroyers. British merchant ships now travel the high seas without adequate protection. Sometimes, only two destroyers protect thirty or forty merchant ships. Aiding Britain is not a solution to Britain's problems. If Britain wins, the enslaved democratic countries can still be revived. As for the long-term aid that Britain needs, it is aircraft and munitions, etc., which are currently being ordered in large quantities in the United States. We are speeding up production, but it will be many months before our efforts show significant results. Taking the aircraft program as an example, this program will not be able to immediately give Britain air superiority until 1942. Britain's greatest danger is the destruction of its merchant ships. When I toured England, I saw the destruction in the northern industrial areas, which was shocking, but the convenience of production was not greatly damaged. If the United States is content to remain isolated, then Britain's survival may be extremely difficult. At this time, no one can say whether Britain can win without the aid of American ships, armaments, and supplies. However, we know for certain that if Britain fails, the totalitarian powers will rule the world. They will not only dominate Europe but will also encompass a large part of Africa and will dominate the Atlantic. After that, Germany may extend its power economically or militarily to the Latin American nations, and Japan will also advance south to covet the Dutch East Indies. Thus, the United States and Canada will be under the pressure of the totalitarian powers. Friction will continue, and the United States will be forced to fight. At that time, we will be alone in the same battle that Britain is in today, but in a different situation. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked, "If Britain fails tomorrow and Germany obtains the British Navy, will the United States not be at war in one or two months?" Wilkie replied, "I believe that Germany will not succeed in invading Britain. British Prime Minister Churchill has said that Britain's greatest needs are destroyers, large bombers, and merchant ships." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Manila – US military authorities announced today that approximately 400 family members of US military officers stationed in the Philippines will return to the United States by transport ships "Etolin" and "Grant" within a week, due to Washington's advocacy of evacuating overseas citizens. At the same time, the Philippine military announced that reserve officers have been called up to begin two weeks of rigorous training starting on February 17. At the same time, close attention is being paid to supervising the training of the Philippine military. Therefore, US military officers stationed here must be increased. The Army Air Corps here is also rapidly expanding. 5,000 specially selected Philippine reservists will participate in a year of training with the indigenous troops in the US military. In addition to the "Grant" and "Etolin," there are six other US transport ships currently en route to the Philippines. According to reliable sources, these ships may bring continuous supplies. When these six ships return to the United States, they will transport the evacuated US military families here. The officers whose families are returning to the United States in the first batch are those whose terms of service in the Philippines will end within the next six months. However, it is understood that subordinates have received orders to remain in the Philippines after their terms of service expire. The families of the US Navy have already evacuated the Philippines. Those who are evacuating this time are the first batch of Army families. In the past, Army authorities had declared that in the event of a crisis, Army families would remain on the Philippine Islands. (United Press International dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Issue of Full American Aid to Britain Has Reached a Critical Juncture: Decision on Whether US Ships Will Escort Merchant Vessels Is Imminent <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>New York – (Dispatch from News Editor Holster) The US government has today approached the most difficult point in the issue of full American aid to Britain. Within a few weeks, it must decide whether to use American warships to escort merchant vessels sailing on the dangerous seas. Britain has reached a point where it clearly needs the United States to decide quickly and give a direct answer. However, the US President cannot make any promises, and his advisors all believe that the use of American warships for escort is fundamentally unavoidable. These advisors report to the President that ships are more important than aircraft. If Britain does not have ships, it will be doomed. However, ships must have naval protection, and Britain does not have enough warships. What is urgently needed at present is at least 300 cargo ships, destroyers, and long-range surface aircraft. Government officials admit that the addition of warships to the service may inevitably trigger a German-American war. If German submarines sink US destroyers or German aircraft sink US cruisers, what other option does the United States have? Therefore, the question of how the US naval escort can be implemented has become a problem. The government authorities have proposed two methods: 1. The United States resumes its former policy of openly patrolling the coast to reduce the threat of attacks on neutral ships, thereby reducing the burden on British ships. 2. Utilize the US-Canada joint defense agreement to withdraw from Newfoundland into the Atlantic, 600 miles out, and have British ships take over. This move can avoid the threat of German aircraft. There are many obstacles to implementing the first method, such as a lack of bases and the inability of Central and South America to cooperate. The disadvantage of the second method is that although the escort distance can be shortened and accelerated, the actual number of ships needed by Britain cannot be reduced. Therefore, an alternative method is not as good as directly transferring destroyers to Britain. However, Secretary of the Navy Knox has stated that the United States can no longer transfer destroyers, otherwise it will weaken its own strength. Senior naval officials agree. In addition to warships, the lack of transport ships is even more important, because without these ships, the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of American armaments for aid to Britain cannot be sent to Britain. The current situation is unstable, approximately as follows: * The current American aid to Britain issue is focused on the fear that Britain will be "defeated" in March. The United States believes that at this time, one aircraft, one ship, or one warship is worth one hundred aircraft and one hundred warships in the future. * The United States is currently building 260 new ships, but none will be completed within a year. * Since June, Germany has sunk 100,000 tons of British ships every week. Even if the 260 American ships are completed overnight, their total of 1 million tons is only enough for Britain for five months. Therefore, the US government must overcome the difficulties of the public enemy escort issue before it can deliver the large quantities of armaments produced next year to Britain. The United States itself only has a slight surplus of armaments for training soldiers. Once this large-scale armament manufacturing is on track, it can be produced in large quantities, reaching hundreds of millions of American dollars per month, and Britain will receive most of it.

<p>Moscow – The Soviet Union has a total tea cultivation area of 56,000 hectares, mostly in Georgia, but in recent years it has expanded to the Caspian Sea area and the subtropics. Each hectare can yield an average of 2,300 kilograms of tea leaves, but there are also records of yields of 11,000 kilograms per hectare. In 1940, the 38 Soviet tea factories produced a total of 13,000 tons of black tea, green tea, and tea bricks. Currently, the Tea Research Institute is conducting investigations to improve the tea industry. The machines invented by the institute can reduce the tea leaf ripening time from 20 hours to 6 hours. At the same time, it is also planned to improve the tea drying method to ensure that the tea leaves do not lose their fragrance. As for tea cultivation in the north, the institute has also invented new methods. (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Mr. Roosevelt's Important Statement <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>President Roosevelt of the United States, in answering reporters' questions at a press conference the day before yesterday, stated that even if the United States were forced to join the war in the Far East, the supply of war materials to Britain would not be affected in the slightest. Although this is a semi-official statement, its content is full of new significance. Not long ago, when Roosevelt called on Americans to aid democratic countries, his appealing argument was only that aiding China and Britain could enable the United States to avoid war. Now, he no longer shies away from the possibility that the United States may be forced to be drawn into the war. The so-called war clearly refers to the war in the Far East. This not only shows that the international situation in the past month or so has developed to another new stage, but also that the US authorities' determination to deal with the situation is no longer restricted by the fearful mentality of avoiding the spread of war at all costs.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the full text of Roosevelt's speech has not yet been transmitted to Shanghai, but the few words that have been transmitted have the force of a thunderbolt, enough to change the situation. First, the United States' fearlessness of challenges from aggressors, since the beginning of October last autumn, has not only been repeatedly expressed, but also seen in actual responses. The public mention of the possibility of joining the war actually began with Roosevelt's speech the day before yesterday. As Reuters explained, this clearly shows that "the United States Navy in the Pacific has the full ability to defend itself and engage in naval battles in the Pacific Ocean." Therefore, if the development of the situation in the Far East proves that peaceful means are not enough to stop aggression, it is expected that the United States will stand up and fight without hesitation. Second, due to its geographical location, dealing with attacks from both oceans at the same time has always been a difficult issue for US national defense. However, in the past half year, because of the recovery of Britain's combat position and the serious defeat of the Italian army in the Middle East and North Africa, the threat to the United States in the Atlantic has been greatly reduced. The US obligation to support Britain was originally only to fully supply war materials. The recent adjustments to and improvements in the US defense industry have enabled the fulfillment of this task to be unaffected by dealing with any crises in the Far East. On the other hand, this is a clear indication that even if the United States expands aid to Britain, it will not hinder the independent and firm implementation of its Far East policy. Although the completion of the US two-ocean navy is still far away, it is now able to fully and freely deal with the threats from both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and is prepared to deal with the worst-case scenario. The two magic weapons used by aggressor nations to achieve their desires, namely, intimidation through false declarations and piecemeal destruction, have long been seen through by various countries. Roosevelt's firm statement this time further proves that the magic weapons have already been broken.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, no matter how its participants conceal and explain it, cannot deny its main intention of dealing with the United States. Targeting the United States' geographical weakness of spanning two oceans, it attempts to use the corresponding actions of allied countries to restrain it, so that the United States cannot take care of both Asia and Europe. If the three countries had been able to take rapid steps to jointly launch an offensive at the beginning of the alliance, then the United States, lacking sufficient preparation beforehand and facing the critical juncture of the election, would have felt it difficult to cope. Perhaps the aggression front would have had a chance to succeed. However, due to the inherent weaknesses of the allied countries and their intention to exploit each other, they are watching and procrastinating, and none of them is willing to risk major sacrifices to complete the task of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for their allies first. This situation was particularly evident in the Japanese authorities' repeated expressions last winter. However, the strong reaction aroused by this issue in the United States did not hesitate or waver due to Matsuoka's rhetoric or Nomura's friendship, but continued to actively implement its spirit of prompt action. When the allied countries saw that all other attempts had been ineffective and tried again to appeal to the terms of the alliance to restrain the United States, the situation had changed. Roosevelt's speech was telling them that this attempt to restrain them had lost its final effectiveness. Even if the war truly expanded to the Pacific due to the instigation of the allied countries, the United States would not hesitate to raise its sword, and the aid to Britain plan would not be hindered in any way. The only slight fortunate result would be, at most, the South Pacific encountering war and Japan bringing suffering upon itself.</p>
<p>This situation seems not to be completely ignored by the Japanese authorities. Therefore, sometimes they express that they do not hesitate to fight, and sometimes they are unwilling to risk war. This flickering and confusing attitude, which makes it impossible to determine the truth, is indeed a kind of external posture, but it cannot completely conceal their inner worries and contradictions. In terms of the traditional policies of the Japanese side and their current situation, they naturally only seek to gain without effort and are unlikely to rescue people from danger. The right-wing military men and politicians who loudly advocate colluding with Germany and Italy to oppose Britain and the United States are all based on superficial utilitarian views and take Germany and Italy's victory as their main premise. If they must fight a hard battle and take great risks, with the future being full of unknowns, then it can be asserted that their calls for advancing south would not be so loud and reach the clouds. Nomura's mission to the United States certainly has the intention of delaying the US's steps. On the other hand, it is not without the intention of using Nomura's personal friendships among American people and his naval officer status to determine the true intentions and military strength of the US. This is exactly why the other army officer, Kawatake, was simultaneously sent to the Soviet Union, which was also not accidental. It is said that Roosevelt, immediately after this speech, will further explain the US position in a clear and firm manner to an old friend who has just arrived in the United States. It is expected that unless the other party has completely lost their senses, they will not completely regard these warnings as trivial matters.</p>

The Japanese troops facing the war zone are the 18th Independent Brigade, the 30th Division, the 4th Division, the 3rd Division, the 40th Division, the 236th Regiment, the 14th Independent Brigade, the 64th Battalion, the 116th Division, the 109th Regiment, the 13th Independent Brigade, the 17th Division, the 53rd Regiment, and the 67th Regiment of the 15th Division, totaling approximately three and a half divisions, with approximately 80,000 infantry, approximately 8,000 cavalry, over 550 cannons, over 300 tanks, and over 200 armored vehicles. From mid-January, they first launched a feigned attack from Yuan'an near the west bank of the Xiang River in western Hubei, intending to draw Chinese troops to fight on the west bank of the Xiang River. The front line extended from ××× via ××××× to ××××, a total front of ××× kilometers. In addition to the guard units, the Chinese troops responsible for the first line of defense had only ×× divisions. To consolidate the occupied territories and fearing Chinese attacks, the Japanese took preemptive action to break the Chinese offensive and launched a major offensive against China in southern Henan on January 24th, taking advantage of Chinese troop movements. (II) Japanese war preparations. The Japanese 17th and 15th Divisions, which participated in the Xiangxi Campaign, secretly concentrated in the southern Henan and northern Hubei area in December of last year. Another part of the 40th Division was transferred from southern Hubei to the vicinity of Xinyang. They also stockpiled food and ammunition in the area and built railways and roads. By mid-January, intelligence obtained by the Chinese side indicated that the Japanese had concentrated approximately 30,000 troops, forty or fifty aircraft, and dozens of tanks near Xinyang, and transported many railway materials. In mid-January, they began guerrilla sweeps north along both sides of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. On the 23rd, they attacked Chinese positions on the west bank of the Xiang River, attempting to contain the Chinese troops in that area. The units concentrated in southern Henan included the entire 3rd Division, attached with the 8th Regiment of the 4th Division, and the Mizuno Tank Unit, under the command of Division Commander Toyoshima of the 3rd Division, forming the left-wing corps. The 17th Division and the 53rd Regiment, attached with the 67th Regiment of the 15th Division and the Yoshimatsu Seto and other tank units, under the command of Division Commander Hirabayashi of the 17th Division, formed the central corps. The 234th, 235th, and 236th Regiments of the 40th Division, as well as the division's cavalry regiment, under the command of Division Commander Amagai of the 40th Division, formed the right-wing corps. Starting on January 21st, they advanced towards Chinese positions in separate routes. The Japanese commander was Kazuo Sonobe, commander of the 11th Army. (II) A summary of the operational process. 1. On the Japanese side. After the Japanese troops advancing in the above three routes broke through the Chinese ×× army's positions on January 25th, their left-wing corps advanced west of the Pinghan Railway, repeatedly attempting to surround the Chinese ×× army between Maoji and Gaoyi. After several days of fierce fighting, on the 27th, they detected the concentration of Chinese troops in the southwestern area of Wuyang and turned north, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese ×× division on the Xiaoshidian Weidian line. On the 30th, they advanced to attack Bao'anzhai and Wuyang. The central corps advanced along the front of the Pinghan Railway. After breaking through the positions near Minggang on the 25th, they engaged in fierce fighting with a part of the ××th Division in Queshan on the 26th. On the 27th, a part attacked Zhugou to the west, with the main force advancing north to Zhumadian. On the 28th, another part attacked Runan to the east, with the main force advancing north to Suiping. On the 29th, a part attacked Shangcai and Xiping, with the main force splitting into two routes and attacking Fangcheng to the west. Three days later, they occupied Wuyang. On the evening of February 2nd, they began to retreat south. The right-wing corps retreated in part to Zhengyang, with the main force retreating to Runan on the 28th, merging with the Japanese army that attacked east from Zhumadian. On the 29th, they attacked Shangcai, merging with the Japanese army that attacked east from Suiping. A part attacked Xiangcheng to the east, while another unit, a motorized force of two to three thousand, attacked Xihua to the north on the 31st, then retreated to Runan to merge with the main force. As for the main force of the corps, on the evening of February 2nd, they also attacked south from Shangcai. The Japanese army that attacked Bao'anzhai in Wuyang to the north attacked Fangcheng to the west on February 1st. With a part attacking Tanghe to the south, the main force, approximately five thousand (belonging to the 3rd Division), split into four routes and advanced to attack Nanyang. After fierce fighting with the Chinese ××××× army in Zhaohe Town, they arrived at Nanyang on the evening of the 4th. After being defeated by a certain Chinese unit at dawn on the 6th, on the same day, a portion of the Japanese army, its main force, retreated towards Xinyang after being heavily attacked by Chinese troops. Currently, there are no Japanese troops in the area west of Tongbai, south of Tanghe, and north of Biyang, Zhumadian, and Zhengyang. Five to six hundred Japanese troops in Tongbai have been surrounded and annihilated by a certain Chinese unit. On the Chinese side. Chinese military operational guidance. Recently, Commander-in-Chief × came to Chongqing on official business. Chairman Chiang personally instructed him, giving him face-to-face instructions. At the same time, the Ministry of Military Affairs followed the instructions and issued operational guidance guidelines. This is based on our strategy of attrition warfare and protracted warfare. The use of military force must be suitable for the requirements of the strategy. Based on this strategy, the supreme guiding principle is to determine the operational plan. The key decision at that time was "secrecy." Therefore, after the Japanese advanced north to the line of Shangshui, Luohe, and Nanyang, they only struck empty air, unable to find the main force of the Chinese army. Their flanks, such as Xinyang, Queshan, Zhengyang, and Biyang, were instead subjected to serious attacks by Chinese troops. Furthermore, the rear lines of communication were repeatedly intercepted, and the supply of food and ammunition was cut off. Therefore, the Japanese made a large swing to the left, retreating towards Fangcheng, Nanyang, and Dianhe. The original intention of the Japanese was to eliminate the Chinese field army, open up the Pinghan Railway, and cut off Chinese transportation, so that our army west of the Pinghan Railway would lose contact. The result was striking at empty air everywhere, gaining nothing. Not finding the main force of the Chinese army, they suffered heavy attacks from the Chinese. At this point, the Japanese plan was completely shattered by China. This campaign yielded great results. The number of Japanese casualties was very large. When retreating from Nanyang, they automatically burned over three hundred cars. We seized approximately three hundred long and short rifles and countless other military supplies. A certain army has been continuously attacking the flanks of the Japanese army in Biyang, and has also obtained many spoils of war. In addition, many Japanese soldiers were captured. Commander-in-Chief Wei Guan Chen reported that, according to the report of a certain commander-in-chief, an educated soldier among the prisoners confessed that the Japanese army advanced rapidly in this invasion with a week of forced marching without rest. At the same time, there was insufficient supplies, and some even had not eaten for three days. They also had no woolen or cotton uniforms, all wearing only單uniforms, which could not withstand the cold. Therefore, their combat effectiveness was weakened. The prisoner also stated that the Japanese troops participating in this battle were transported from Hankou by柴轮to Guangzhou. This shows that the Japanese are indeed eager to advance south. I have previously reported this matter. The most gratifying thing about this campaign is the brave fighting of the soldiers and the appropriate guidance of the officers. The commanders at all levels of the ×th war zone, from the commander-in-chief down, were able to thoroughly carry out orders. This proves that the thinking of Chinese military tactics has become completely consistent. The theories of attrition warfare and mobile warfare that have been advocated in recent years are very correct. (B) In the ×th war zone. The Japanese landed east of Dapeng Bay, Duntou Bay, and Aotou, advancing towards Danshui and Pinghu, attempting to cut off our transportation between Hong Kong and Huizhou. These are currently only small-scale battles. According to a telegram from Commander-in-Chief ××, and a report from Commander Yuan of ××, who is advancing towards Doumen, on the fifth of this month, a large plane was destroyed with machine gun fire in Dachikan, District 8, Zhongshan County. Naval Admiral Baron Osamu Osami and several naval officers also died. Various forces have proven that Osamu intended to go to Hainan Island from Guangzhou to preside over the southward advance plan. Here, we can also see his active pursuit of a risky southward advance, which coincides with the confession of the prisoners interrogated in the ×th war zone. After receiving the report, the central government ordered Commander Wei Guan of × to transport the body of Admiral Osamu to Kunlun Pass to be buried with the Japanese officers and soldiers who died in the previous Battle of Kunlun Pass, in order to show preferential treatment to the fallen Japanese soldiers. The above is a summary of the war in the ×× two war zones. Currently, we are indeed confident in military affairs, and the foundation for final victory has been laid. The most important issue in the future is not military affairs, but to promote our political and economic construction with all our spirits, hoping to complete the great cause of nation-building at the same time as winning the war.

The news especially warned British Prime Minister Churchill, saying that the German Air Force will use Bulgaria as an operational base. According to news from the Hungarian capital, about one hundred aircraft have flown over the Hungarian capital in the past forty-eight hours.

It is said that Germany is gathering heavy troops in the Balkans, and its actions are becoming more active. Therefore, most people believe that Germany is speeding up preparations to invade the Balkans. British sources believe that Germany is at least preparing to show off its power and exert pressure on Greece, so as to alleviate the difficulties encountered by Prime Minister Mussolini in Albania. Later, the British also believed that Germany would exert pressure on Turkey. (12th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland - It is reported that Hitler, Pétain, Mussolini, and Franco will meet at 11:00 AM today on the French Riviera coast to discuss the collapse of Italian forces in Africa. General Franco's special car entered French territory from the Barcelona area at 8:00 AM this morning. (United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Vichy - French Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Darlan, and Interior Minister Béraud, left Vichy by car this morning to attend the Franco-German talks to be held tomorrow afternoon on the French Riviera. The two will likely meet with Marshal Pétain, Franco, and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer at Pétain's villa. At the same time, French officials stated that they had not heard of any Anglo-Italian peace negotiations being held on the French Riviera. It is said that this rumor may have arisen from a misunderstanding regarding Franco's visit to Italy. Officials stated that General Franco was not in the Riviera today; he crossed the border into Italy last night and will return to France on Thursday. It is said that Pétain and Franco will largely not be involved in Anglo-Italian peace talks, as Pétain has no qualifications to speak on behalf of either England or Italy. Well-informed sources expressed doubt as to whether England and Italy would send representatives to France without notifying their governments. However, observers said that Darlan's departure today to join Pétain for talks was quite important. Previously, it was believed that the meeting between Pétain and Franco was merely a ceremonial contact between the heads of two states, but a Spanish source indicated that the talks would have deeper and broader significance. It is reported that Marshal Pétain arrived at the villa in Villeneuve-Loubet on the Riviera at 8:45 AM this morning. (United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome - As rumors circulate that Spanish dictator General Franco has arrived in San Remo to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, yesterday Italian newspapers hinted that the Axis powers would take significant actions involving Spain. A reporter for the "Italian Daily" reported from the current location that "the Axis powers' precise and unchanging military procedures will soon be completed." The newspaper also warned that if the United States arrived in time to rescue Britain from destruction, "America will see that all of Europe will fight against its armed forces." Rumors that General Franco came to Italy to mediate the Italian-Greek war have been denied by officials here. Officials said that the Italian-Greek war cannot be mediated. They hinted that General Franco's visit was related to a major Axis action involving Spain, but the nature of this action was not disclosed. Whether Franco's visit is related to Spain joining the Axis powers or an attack on Gibraltar has aroused much speculation. It is said that General Franco appears to sympathize with the Axis powers on the one hand, but is also forced to comply with American foreign policy on the other. Mr. Franco's situation is truly a mystery. (International News Service dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>England Denies Intention to Make Peace with Italy; Downplays Italian-Spanish Talks</p>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that a responsible spokesperson in London solemnly denied rumors that Britain is preparing to negotiate a separate peace with Italy, saying that the war against Italy will continue with increased force. Informed sources also believe that Mussolini has no intention of seeking peace. The true intention of this meeting with Franco is to seek new assistance to resist Britain. However, the general opinion in London is that Franco has already announced a policy of "peace, tranquility, and food," and may not be willing to get involved in the war. People here do not attach much importance to the meeting between the leaders of Italy and Spain, considering it merely a ceremonial visit by Franco to his old friend. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Spain Evolves from Neutral Status to Non-Belligerent Status</p>
<p>Vichy - Reliable sources here recently confirmed that Spanish head of state Franco, accompanied by Foreign Minister Suñer, has traveled through France to Italy to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. German leader Hitler may also travel to Italy to meet with them. On his return journey, General Franco will also meet with Marshal Pétain in southern France. There are many rumors about the purpose of Franco's trip. One says that Spain, on the one hand, has close relations with Italy, and on the other hand, maintains friendly relations with Britain, so it is an ideal mediator for the current war between Britain and Italy. But other sources say that the dictators of Italy and Spain have the possibility of meeting with German leader Hitler at the same time, which shows that this is a sign of the Axis powers consulting with each other before launching a large-scale offensive against England. The French government has remained silent on this matter, neither denying nor confirming what has been published in the newspapers in semi-official statements, only reiterating Spain's position since the outbreak of the European war. It is generally said that General Franco first issued a statement on September 4, 1939, declaring that "Spain's interests in the Mediterranean and Africa will be strictly neutral with respect to the European war as long as they are not directly hindered." This position has been repeatedly stated in editorials published by the country's newspapers. It was not until after Italy declared war on England last June that Spain evolved from a neutral country to a "non-belligerent country." Subsequently, semi-official statements repeatedly stated that "non-belligerent country" did not mean that the country sided with one of the belligerents, but only meant that the country was in a "state of alert." Until October last year, the authorities of Germany, Italy, and Spain again held direct talks. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer visited Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Berlin, and then traveled to Rome to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. Before Marshal Pétain and Hitler met in Montoire, France, on October 23 last year, Franco personally crossed the border between France and Spain and met with Hitler in Hendaye. This is a general overview of the changes in Spain's position over the past year and a half. However, in recent weeks, the situation in the Mediterranean has entered another stage. Franco must meet with the leaders of Germany and Italy again, and take the opportunity to meet with Marshal Pétain, because since the end of the Spanish Civil War, General Pétain has served as the first French ambassador to Spain, and the leaders of France and Spain know each other very well.

South African troops have penetrated enemy-occupied territory southeast of Lake Rudolf and are advancing along the ring road connecting the Abyssinian capital with the Red Sea to the northeast, threatening two important routes traversing Abyssinia from east to west, linking southern Abyssinia with Italian Somaliland. It is reported that this military operation is progressing smoothly. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London - London has just received a detailed battle report stating that British South African troops made great contributions in the British army's capture of Hobok, a southern Abyssinian town. South African troops met with a British unit from Turkana, camped on the border, and then advanced through 18 miles of dense jungle towards their target. A brigade commander described the march, saying that the rapid advance of the British motorized troops through this extremely difficult jungle was an unprecedented achievement for motorized troops. In the western desert, Indian infantry, engineers, and mechanized cavalry also achieved great successes in operations in Eritrea. The terrain in this area is similar to the northwestern border of India, so Indian troops found it easy to operate. In bayonet fighting, they repeatedly captured heights held by Italian troops and immediately attacked down the slopes. In the Battle of Barentu, Indian troops fought for many days before capturing the area. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

Shoes made of pigskin and shark skin are not only strong, but also very beautiful in color. Therefore, the general public is increasingly happy to use them. In addition, hard rubber is widely used and can replace metals such as lead, tin, and antimony in the manufacture of various daily necessities. Waterworks in Tokyo and Osaka will use this material to manufacture water taps. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - U Ba Khin, head of the Burmese Journalists' Delegation, gave a broadcast speech after returning to Rangoon a few days ago, expressing his impressions of the trip. He praised Chairman Chiang's leadership in China's resistance and reconstruction efforts. He said that Chairman Chiang, who is admired by the people of the whole country, is a sincere, talented, and virtuous leader, worthy of the people's support. The most profound impression the reporter had during this trip to China was the unity and solidarity of the whole country in resisting and building the country. The development of Chinese industry is also worthy of praise. As for China's foreign trade, the reporter dared to say that there is great potential for trade between China and Burma. The Yunnan-Burma Highway has been completed, and the Yunnan-Burma Railway has also begun construction. This highway and this railway will increasingly promote trade between China and Burma. China needs many goods from Burma, just as Burma needs goods from China. How to seize the current opportunity to develop trade with China depends on the efforts of the Burmese people. U Ba Khin then discussed China's achievements in eliminating illiteracy. It is said that the efforts of Chinese scholars and teachers have made a deep impression on individuals. The spirit of the Chinese people in enduring and overcoming all obstacles and difficulties is admirable. Before the war, there were only 33 colleges in inland China, but now there are 101. This is enough to prove the progress of the Chinese people in the war. The reporter saw Chinese students studying in temporary venues without being deterred by repeated Japanese bombings, which was admirable. The simplicity of life is also touching. (Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>At this time, important developments also occurred in the Far East. In the spring of 1939, when Japan blockaded the British Concession in Tianjin, both Britain and France had intentions of compromising with Japan. President Roosevelt and Hull had already considered abolishing the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty to counteract Japanese trade, threatening the Japanese military with the cutoff of military supplies. Hull immediately consulted secretly with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and decided to have Senator Vandenberg propose a motion to abolish the treaty. This move came from a leading figure of the isolationist faction, which was exactly what President Roosevelt and Hull were seeking. The treaty was declared abolished at the end of July.</p>
<p>In August 1939, Hitler concentrated a large army to prepare for an attack on Poland. Britain and France had provided guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Turkey, willing to provide assistance. Negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were on the verge of collapse. On the American side, due to the arms embargo not yet being lifted, their words lacked weight. However, after discussions between the President and Welles, it was decided to make one last appeal for peace, planning to send a telegram to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, asking him to mediate peace.</p>
<p>Around August 1st to 5th, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg hinted to Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov that Hitler was preparing to negotiate a German-Soviet treaty. When this news reached the State Department, the President had already left Washington for a vacation in Hyde Park, New York.</p>
<p>Other countries were greatly astonished by this news. However, since 1934, the United States had already received warnings, issued by U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt. Although Britain and France had also received similar warnings, they never believed it would actually happen. In fact, after the purge in the Soviet Union, Stalin had already suggested to Hitler that they jointly attack Western European countries. At that time, Hitler refused because he feared Britain and had not yet abandoned his plan to advance eastward. However, negotiations between the two countries on this matter never ceased, with frequent contact through special diplomatic channels and between business delegations and military authorities of both sides.</p>
<p>As early as the beginning of 1939, Hitler, influenced by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's urging and the weakness of British policy, greatly changed his attitude towards Britain. Secret German-Soviet negotiations then entered a new stage. In May, the Soviet Union replaced Litvinov with Molotov as Foreign Affairs Commissar. When Britain and Poland formed a temporary agreement, Hitler instructed Ambassador Schulenburg to inform Molotov that the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Germany, Japan, and Italy had no real meaning, that Britain was the common enemy of the Soviet Union and Germany, and that the two countries should increase relations in trade and other areas. Hitler's original intention was only to keep the Soviet Union out of the united front of Britain, France, and Poland. Unexpectedly, Molotov's reply advocated not only increasing trade relations but also enhancing political relations. Schulenburg was surprised to hear this.</p>
<p>Germany and the Soviet Union then began negotiations on a commercial agreement, but Hitler still hoped that Poland would yield on the Danzig issue, so as to use the "Polish Corridor" to attack Soviet Ukraine. Molotov's suggestion did not receive a concrete response for a while. While urging Schulenburg to reply, Stalin ordered Defense Commissar Voroshilov to discuss an anti-German front with Britain and France. Later, the Danzig issue reached a stalemate, and Hitler, knowing that Poland could not be subdued, abruptly changed the course of negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Britain and France, like the U.S. State Department, received the same intelligence. However, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds and French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Payart did not believe a German-Soviet alliance was possible. They deeply believed in Voroshilov's resounding and sincere proposals (Voroshilov was also completely unaware of the tricks that Stalin and Molotov were secretly playing). At that time, only China, after receiving the news, acted accordingly. Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Chinese Executive Yuan, sent a personal representative who flew to Paris on August 8th to meet with U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt. After obtaining confidential information, he immediately telegraphed Chongqing. After receiving this telegram, Chiang Kai-shek, after consulting with several ministers of the Executive Yuan, politely refused a certain grain treaty that the Soviet Union had requested to be concluded. On August 16th, Voroshilov hinted to the British and French representatives that as long as Poland allowed a portion of Soviet troops to enter its territory, the Soviet Union could join their front to resist Germany. He did not know that on that very day, Schulenburg and Molotov had already finalized the text of the German-Soviet treaty.</p>
<p>At dawn on September 1, 1939, the President was awakened by a wireless telephone from Paris reporting the German invasion of Poland. He turned on the light, propped himself up on the pillow, lit a cigarette, and then made separate phone calls to Hull, Welles, Secretary of War Woodring, and Secretary of the Navy Edison, notifying them of the warning. Woodring and Edison also notified Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Chief of Naval Operations Stark, immediately ordering the fleets in the Pacific and Atlantic and the army units from Samoa in the South Pacific to Fort Devens in Massachusetts via wireless telegraph.</p>
<p>Hull and Welles quickly got up and rushed to the State Department. Shortly after, Under Secretary of State Welles, Chief of the European Division Moffat, and others also arrived one after another. In reality, they had nothing to do at this time except wait for telegrams. Most of the time, they sat around Hull's desk, discussing the war aimlessly, like people at a funeral mourning the deceased. Only Welles sighed with emotion, "We have waited for Europe to die, and it can be said that we have finally seen it happen."</p>
<p>The President, however, was very at ease. After completing the notifications, he fell back asleep until 6:30 AM, when a second wireless telephone call from U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt woke him up again. In a short period of time, Bullitt had met with French Premier Daladier, who said fatalistically that he had already declared that Britain and France must aid Poland, otherwise they would not be able to establish themselves and would lose the last chance to resist the spread of National Socialist forces. Bullitt also reported to the President that Britain and France would definitely join the war. Such news would naturally throw others into confusion, but the President remained calm and unhurried, sleeping for another forty-five minutes until a telephone call from British Ambassador Kennedy in London woke him up for the third time. Kennedy reported on his meeting with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, the nature of which was no different from what Bullitt and Daladier had discussed, but Kennedy's tone was extremely pessimistic. At this point, the President no longer intended to sleep. He called his servants to prepare breakfast and spent an hour planning the overall situation in bed.</p>
<p>Before the President's plans were finalized, Welles barged into the bedroom and held a bedside meeting with the President. It was immediately decided that as soon as Britain and France declared war on Germany, a special Pan-American conference would be convened. The President advocated drawing a safety zone in the territorial waters and contiguous waters of the American countries, and implementing a "neutrality patrol" by the U.S. fleet, so that the entire Western Hemisphere would not be affected by naval warfare. After Welles left, the President ordered Edison to draft a plan.</p>
<p>At this time, the President got out of bed, put on his robe, and walked into the office to meet with reporters. Shortly after, Hull also arrived. They then made separate wireless telephone calls to the ambassadors in Britain and France, the minister to Poland, and the chargé d'affaires in Germany. They felt that since the war had already broken out and people were terrified, amending the Neutrality Act to abolish the provisions prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to belligerent countries in order to aid democratic countries would surely gain the support of the majority of people, but a special session of Congress could only be convened after public opinion had matured.</p>
<p>At around 4:00 AM on Sunday, September 3rd, the telephone by the President's bedside rang again. Ambassador Kennedy reported the gist of Chamberlain's declaration of war speech to the President, which was given to Kennedy two hours before its release. Ambassador Kennedy was extremely emotional and at this time was extremely sad, constantly saying, "The world is over, everything is over."</p>
<p>However, the President did not react with the same emotionalism as Kennedy, and tried his best to comfort him over the phone. Then, the President again called each of the cabinet members to notify them of the new developments in the war. The President slept for a while, got up early, and prepared his broadcast address. Welles had already sent out notices in the morning to convene a special Pan-American conference. At around 11:00 AM, he went to the White House to present the agenda of the Pan-American conference and the scope of the safety zone for the President's review. The plan designated a safety zone of one hundred leagues around the sea surrounding the Western Hemisphere, but the President did not agree. He personally used a ruler to redraw the boundaries, expanding the safety zone to an average of three hundred miles and straightening the boundaries.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the President read his broadcast address in the Lincoln Study of the White House, with Hull, Welles, Welles, and others sitting around the President. The main points of the President's speech were that the United States should remain neutral, that the Neutrality Act would remain in effect until amended, that foreign propaganda should be prevented, and that the countries of North and South America must be urged to unite. He also solemnly said, "I hope that the United States will not be drawn into the vortex of this war, and I believe we can definitely do it."</p>
<p>The chaotic situation of early September came to an end. After this, the President and Hull and others continued to work hard to amend the Neutrality Act, first abolishing the arms embargo, and then finding ways to help democratic countries resist aggression. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Office Searched Yesterday Morning Important Documents of the Association Had Been Transported to Hong Kong Only National Loan Domestic Sales Certificates Are Now Being Issued The Police Department Has Sent a Large Number of Detectives to Protect It <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The address of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was originally located at the north end of Tianhougong Bridge on North Henan Road. After the National Army withdrew westward, it was forcibly occupied by a certain party. The association, in addition to moving most of its important documents to Hong Kong with Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Standing Committee Member Du Yuesheng, Jin Runyang, and others to establish an office, set up an office in Shanghai at Room 305, 3rd Floor, No. 59 Hong Kong Road. This has been nearly three years. Yesterday morning, at Huashi, it was suddenly invaded and some documents were seized. Later, after the detectives and the American Team of the Chamber of Commerce arrived, the invaders left one after another. The Chamber of Commerce is now preparing for the aftermath and continuing to work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Large Number of People Invaded and Searched</p>
<p>At 9:30 yesterday morning, more than 50 people, in two trucks, accompanied by several foreigners, went to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce office at No. 59 Hong Kong Road, intending to seize all the documents. At that time, more than a dozen staff members of the association were busy working, and after being forced to search, they were driven out one by one, and some of the documents were wrapped up and taken away.</p>
<p>Detectives and Chamber of Commerce Team Rushed to Protect</p>
<p>The association reported the above situation to the Public Concession Police Department, which dispatched a large number of detectives from the smoking room and dispatched the American Team of the Chamber of Commerce to protect and stop the seizure of items. When these people saw this situation, they left one after another. Yesterday afternoon, the office was guarded by detectives, and the American Chamber of Commerce team was stationed in front of No. 59 Hong Kong Road and the east and west ends of Hong Kong Road to provide protection.</p>
<p>Continuing to Issue National Product Certificates</p>
<p>It is reported that the documents seized from the association's office were not important. The most important task of the association is to issue national product certificates, because goods from Shanghai merchants transported to the mainland cannot be sold without the association's certificates. Since the Shanghai business community has this need, the association is preparing for the aftermath so that it can continue to work as usual.</p>
<p>Newspaper Report on What Happened</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that today (the 12th), the Japanese attempted to take over the documents of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. It is reported that at 10:00 in the morning, 12 Japanese men in plain clothes, accompanied by several Chinese, went to the Chamber of Commerce office in the Bank Club at No. 59 Hong Kong Road and "requested" the surrender of the records and documents of the Chamber of Commerce. However, people in the Chamber of Commerce reported to the General Patrol Room. Before long, many senior police officers arrived and negotiated for a long time before resolving the matter and preventing the Japanese from moving a single item. It is reported that these Japanese did not carry any formal proof papers. At that time, the Japanese also drove several trucks to the side of Hong Kong Road, apparently intending to transport all the documents of the Chamber of Commerce. However, after the Public Concession police arrived at the scene, the Japanese did not obtain any documents from the Chamber of Commerce and left.</p>

<p>The authorities of the two concessions continue to implement price supervision policies within the concessions. The Price Control Committee of the French Concession Public Works Department and the Price Investigation Office of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau cooperated closely last year to crack down on high prices and improper habits of merchants, which was quite effective. Last year, the Price Investigation Office of the Public Concession filed 187 lawsuits against unscrupulous merchants in some months of the second half of the year. Most of them were fined for charging prices exceeding the label or for selling items with insufficient weight, which made these people know how to restrain themselves. The authorities of the two concessions, in view of the fact that prices are still high since the new year, have decided to continue to maintain close contact and strengthen cooperation in some aspects in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. In addition to effectively monitoring the wholesale and retail prices of major items, the weights and measures used by merchants will be inspected at any time, and the evil practice of monopoly and hoarding will be strictly cracked down on. In order to fundamentally suppress the prices in Shanghai, the restrictions on the shipment of some major items to Shanghai will be resolved step by step with the assistance of relevant parties.</p>

<p>Du Ting, a well-known Far East reporter and current Shanghai correspondent for the "New York Times," returned to Shanghai on the SS President Coolidge yesterday, the 11th, after vacationing in the United States. According to him, the United States itself does not know whether it will join the European war. The world is now asking about the psychology of the American people. In fact, the American people have abandoned their fatalistic ideas and mostly believe that the United States' participation in the war is inevitable. Du Ting has been in the Far East for ten years. It was not until October of last year that he and his wife left Shanghai for the first time for a vacation. When staying at his residence in Pecos City, Texas, he witnessed the presidential election. According to Du Ting, Roosevelt's election as the third president is the clear will of the people. Du Ting also criticized the national defense program that the United States has been carrying out for six months, saying that the entire United States has only now begun to devote itself to the national defense program. Isolationists and advocates of compromise are still active under the leadership of Senator Wheeler. However, on the whole, the United States has united and is determined to work hard to rebuild its armaments. According to reports, Du Ting was stationed in Chongqing as the representative of the "New York Times" before his vacation last year. This time, he came to China as the Shanghai correspondent for the newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="e47">This Year's Engineering Bureau Election Decided to Be Handled According to the Chen Method The Qualifications of Electors are Strictly Regulated The Japanese Proposal is Not Allowed by Legal Facts <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Engineering Bureau issued a bulletin yesterday, announcing the regulations regarding the qualifications of electors and the method of compiling the electoral roll. It is reported that these provisions have been approved by the Engineering Bureau and will be implemented in the election of the directors and land committee members of the Engineering Bureau for the 1941-42 fiscal year in April. Several of the provisions issued by the Engineering Bureau adopted the recommendations of the Special Election Committee. However, the issue of the "scattered voting method" was not mentioned. It is reported that the Engineering Bureau will use last year's method for the election this year and will not change the "scattered voting method." At the meeting of the Special Election Committee, the members failed to reach a resolution on the issue of the "scattered voting method." Representatives of Japan, Germany, and Italy requested that "extraordinary" measures be taken for the "scattered voting method" and demanded that it be abolished. However, the three members from Britain, the United States, and France believed that the Engineering Bureau did not have the legal right to require landowners to prove that they were genuine owners.</p>
<p>Election Qualifications Strictly Limited</p>
<p>The provisions on the qualifications of electors issued by the Engineering Bureau stipulate that any individual or business firm who wishes to apply to be added to the final electoral roll must submit the application at least one month before the date of election of the directors. After this deadline, all applications will not be accepted. The Secretary-General of the Engineering Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Charter, will publish a preliminary list of individuals or business firms eligible to participate in the election on or around December 20. The final electoral roll, which has been revised, will be published as soon as possible one month before the election date. Landowners who have been registered, if they fail to pay the land rent for the year prior to the Engineering Bureau election and the annual meeting of taxpayers one month before the election, their names will not be added to the final electoral roll. The names of registered landowners whose land ownership was acquired between January 1 and the date the Engineering Bureau publishes the final electoral roll will not be added to the final electoral roll. However, this registered landowner will be listed as an exception if he pays the land rent for the first half of the year one month before the date of the directors' election. The regulations on the qualifications of electors and the method of compiling the electoral roll issued by the H-Bureau are mostly the same as those issued last year.</p>
<p>Japanese Proposals Cannot Be Adopted</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Engineering Bureau officials today refused to comment on the interim report released yesterday by the Bureau's Special Election Committee, saying only, "The public must be able to draw their own conclusions." The opinions of the Special Election Committee on the election issue are now divided into two equally powerful units, namely, the German member Grede, the Italian member Fumagalli, and the Japanese member Yasui Gengo, who support Yasui Gengo's proposal. Others, such as the American member Kana, the British member Mitchell, and the French member Chavret, unanimously opposed this proposal. According to An's proposal, a special committee of five people should be organized to investigate the qualifications of voters and land transferors in the Public Concession. The reason for this is that no business firm or individual should have more than one vote. However, another member of the committee claimed that this was beyond the powers of the Engineering Bureau. An also made a suggestion to the committee, saying, "According to the established procedure, the transfer of land ownership should not be used as a reason for joining the electoral roll before the transfer is made at the Chinese Land Office. However, at present, the Chinese Land Office has stopped working. Therefore, to prove that they are landowners, they should submit all files and other relevant documents to the Engineering Bureau." At that time, some members raised opinions, saying that the Engineering Bureau did not have the power to require others to prove that they were landowners. Another member said that if the election used the registered method, a large number of current voters would object. If the Engineering Bureau removed their names from the electoral roll, they could sue the Engineering Bureau in the Consular Court and force the Engineering Bureau to re-add their names to the electoral roll.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnhold's Candid Expression</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that the American Chinese Association had decided to nominate Arnhold and McMullen as candidates for the Engineering Bureau directors after several meetings, and would no longer resolve the matter by voting among the overseas Chinese. However, some overseas Chinese expressed their opposition. After seeing the report, a reporter from the Great China News Agency visited Mr. Arnhold yesterday afternoon to inquire about his opinion. According to reports, "It seems too early for me to express my attitude at this time." The reporter also asked, "According to what is currently known, the American Chinese Association has already nominated you and McMullen as candidates. With the current situation, it seems that there will be no preliminary election of American directors this year. In the future, will there be any chance for the American Chinese Association to change this issue?" The reply was, "Although the American Chinese Association has already nominated us two as candidates, if there are still some overseas Chinese who advocate adding one or two candidates, then a preliminary election must be held." When Mr. Arnhold made this statement, his attitude was extraordinarily candid, believing that his actions were all based on the will of the public, without any prejudice whatsoever. This is especially admirable.</p>
<p>Five Chinese Directors Decided to Continue</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Chinese Taxpayers Association said yesterday that the current situation is critical, and it is not planned to hold the election of the five Chinese directors this year. It has been decided to respect the unanimous opinions of the taxpayers and ask the five Chinese directors to continue. According to an Engineering Bureau official, the Engineering Bureau has no direct control over the election methods adopted by the Chinese Taxpayers Association. After the Chinese Taxpayers Association decides who will be elected as Chinese directors, it only needs to notify the Engineering Bureau of the decision, and the Engineering Bureau will recognize the directors it has put forward as legal.</p>

<p>The authorities of the two concessions have specially proposed seven measures for the Rice Market Management Committee and instructed the market to earnestly implement them as of today. The association has discussed and revised them one by one in a meeting a few days ago. Yesterday, it was reported to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, requesting a review before implementation. The Bean and Rice Association has scheduled a temporary committee meeting for 3:00 PM tomorrow at No. 15 Edward Road to discuss the matter at length so that a decision can be made. A letter from the Rice Grain Brokerage Association has been sent to the Miscellaneous Grain Association, stating that the association has informed all its members that they must not sneak into the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange under any pretext every afternoon. If they dare to do so deliberately, they will report to the concession authorities for investigation. However, the letter also stated that senior officials in the rice industry are also involved in such illegal transactions, and the association is requested to find a way to stop them.</p>

<p>Colonel Xiang Pei, the commander of the Shanghai International Chamber of Commerce, will be returning to China in the near future after completing his three-year term. Yesterday evening, he made a farewell inspection of the members of the Chinese Team and the Translation Team of the regiment in the Engineering Bureau drill hall. At 5:30 PM, all the members of the two teams and the newly replenished reserve team arrived on time. Major Chen Shixia, the commander of the Chinese team, served as the general commander and formed three horizontal teams. At 6:30 PM, Colonel Xiang Pei and Deputy Commander Xu Tonghao arrived. First, the entire team raised their guns with both hands in salute, and then the inspection was held. After the inspection, Captain Chen led the officers of the two teams to the officer's room on the fourth floor for a drink. At around 7:00 PM, they returned to the regiment's gym to ask the commander to distribute the awards to the members of the Chinese team from the previous session. Those who received the 12-year Engineering Bureau Long Service Medal included Wang Tingkui, Liu Mingshan, Ye Renqian, Liu Hanzhang, Gao Junzhi, Chen Yueqiu, Shen Guanbao, Ding Guobao, etc. Yu Xian'en received the 25-year Merit Award, Li Yushu and Gu Runsheng received the 20-year Award, Zhang Qixiang, Pan Mingxin, Shen Guanbao, and Jiang Zhongjia received the 15-year Award, and Cao Siqin and Zhang Huaiqing received the 10-year Award. (There were many others who received the 5-year, 3-year, and full award medals and certificates, whose names are omitted.) After the awards were given, Captain Chen used the name of the Chinese team to commemorate something. The commander gave a speech, admonishing everyone. He especially praised the Chinese team members for their neat uniforms, excellent military appearance and discipline, enthusiastic participation in training, and their past enthusiasm for serving public security. After the ceremony, everyone dispersed with cheers.</p>

<p>Although it is now spring, the weather is bitterly cold, even more so than last winter. Yesterday, starting from noon, amidst the drizzling rain, snow pellets suddenly fell, and snowflakes fluttered in the air. It was the first snowfall of the year, lasting about two hours before stopping. The snow continued to fall into the evening, accumulating to about an inch. In addition, there was a high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday, causing water to accumulate on the low-lying roads in the two concessions, almost submerging ankles.</p>

<p>According to news from the agency, the day before yesterday evening, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai, a man opened fire on a passing car but missed. "Police" heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, shooting and killing the man. It is reported that a black car (number unknown) was traveling east when, near the wire mesh fence of the Paramount Hotel, the man suddenly drew a gun and fired three shots at the car. The driver of the car quickly accelerated and crossed the wire mesh, so he was not hit. The shooter was then shot and injured by the guard "police". One bullet hit a vital spot, and he fell immediately near the Tailai car dealership at the intersection of Yuyuan Road. He died after a while. The deceased was about twenty years old and was wearing a blue long robe.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Robbery on the Street, One Culprit Killed <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Ling Hongxi, a nineteen-year-old youth from Wanlai Youth Association, residing at 344 Ying Shi Road in the French Concession, his father, Ling Yufa, is currently fifty-eight years old and has always been a peddler. Hongxi is unemployed. At around 10:00 PM on the 7th of this month, while passing Lane 131 on Rue Bourgeat, two street robbers dashed out from the lane. He fled forward, with Hongxi running wildly behind him. When he fled to the entrance of No. 189 Route Lafayette, he happened to encounter a patrolman No. 923 who ordered him to stop for inspection. Not only did they not listen, but the three of them continued to rush forward. The patrolman then opened fire to pursue and arrest them. The two robbers in front quickly disappeared, while Ling Hongxi, who was behind, was hit by nine bullets, injured and fell to the ground. When the patrolman approached to check, he found a fake pistol left beside Ling's body, determining that Ling Hongxi was suspected of being a thief. The patrolman took the fake pistol back to the police station, reported to the head, and sent Ling to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He also sent detectives to investigate. According to his family, Ling was still studying at a certain school but could not provide conclusive evidence of innocence. Ling died from his injuries yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police station and the body was taken to the Tongren Funeral Home, awaiting family members to claim the body for burial today.</p>

<p>Zhang Er Guniang, a twenty-four-year-old woman from Jiangbei residing in a non-numbered bungalow in Hangzhou, on the night of February 21st of the 28th year of the Republic of China, colluded with her lover Pang Kaishi and, while her husband Bao Youqing was sound asleep, used an axe to shatter Bao's head and moved the body to a nearby pond. They then escaped together. In early March of the same year, Bao's body floated to the surface, and his mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou (i.e., Zhang Er Guniang's mother), identified the body and reported it to the police station, which arrested Pang Kaibao and sentenced him to death by the First Special Court. The appeal was also rejected. Zhang Er Guniang then secretly cohabited with Gao Yuanjia, a fellow townsman, and became pregnant. Recently, she was arrested by the Gordon Road police station, taken to the First Special Court, and prosecuted for murder. The trial was adjourned. The continued trial yesterday morning could not take place because the defendant, Zhang Er Guniang, gave birth in the detention center and could not appear in court. The court ordered an adjournment until the 21st of this month for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Remembering Mr. Xiong Deshan (3) - Nanhai <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>In the years 25 and 26, I traveled to Liangguang from time to time, and had many opportunities to meet with Mr. Xiong. Southwestern political figures such as Mr. Li Zongren and Mr. Li Jishen also had many opportunities to meet with him, but he had no intention of pursuing an official career. However, the Gui province authorities often consulted his opinions on southwestern political issues.</p>
<p>After the "August 13th" incident, he took his family to Gui from Shanghai. I was very worried about his health, but he said, "Now that the Japanese army has penetrated deep into China, every Chinese person should stand at their post, embrace the determination to sacrifice, and actively resist under the leadership of the sole leader, Chairman Jiang. Personal health is really nothing!" He went to Wuzhou and learned that Xida was closed and the Faculty of Arts and Law had been dismissed. At that time, the war had just begun, and he was struggling to find a place to settle his family, so he had to go to Guilin. He did not resume his professorship until Xida restored its old appearance in the 27th year. The North China University in Beiping moved to Chengdu and planned to hire him to be a professor in the Department of Sociology, but he declined due to illness. At that time, information was sparse. I only heard that during the Japanese air raids on Guilin, the house he lived in on Xincang Street was repeatedly bombed, and all his books were destroyed. He had no choice but to move with his illness to Dabuxiang in the countryside near Liangfeng. Medical treatment was inconvenient in the countryside, and his illness turned critical, leading to his death.</p>
<p>Ever since Mr. Xiong edited the Today's Magazine in Beijing, he had resolved to devote himself to scholarship. For many years, he worked hard consistently. His life and scholarship were always strict and arduous, which led to the gradual deterioration of his physical strength and severe neurasthenia. When he was a professor at the Dapuqiao College of Law and Politics, doctors already considered treatment difficult. When he was a professor of history at Xida, he only taught five or six hours a week, but he was very serious about editing his lectures, never being perfunctory. At the same time, he had to spend a lot of energy collecting reference materials and writing lecture notes to prepare for explanations in the classroom. This was how serious he was about being a professor. He studied a wide range of books in his childhood and had a very good foundation in old learning. In his middle age, he embraced socialism and had a deep understanding of methodology. He was also a meticulous person, so his achievements in history in his later years were mostly careful and precise, with few extravagant or rash claims. In this great era of resistance and reconstruction, although he did not directly go to the front line, he remained consistently loyal to scholarship and his own beliefs. From the perspective of a scholar, he fulfilled his greatest task.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong's childhood name was Xuejun, his courtesy name was Desan. He changed his name to Kangnian when he studied in Japan, and later changed it to Deshan. He was born in Guangxu Ji Chou (1889) in Hao Xue Xiong Gang, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, and died on February 4th in the 28th year of the Republic of China, at the age of fifty. His wife, Ms. Deng Lichang, was from Jingde, Anhui Province. She lived in Jingzhou with her official husband. She was virtuous, diligent, and frugal, and taught her children the right way. She married Mr. Xiong on January 1st in the second year of the Republic of China. They had four sons. The eldest, Yongzhu, is twenty-four years old and is currently studying in the Department of Economics at Guangxi University. He is taciturn, hardworking, and able to carry on his father's legacy. The other three sons are still young. In addition, his wife and mother also lived in Dabuxiang in the countryside of Guilin. Mr. Xiong's funeral was simple, almost without anything for burial. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, the leaders of Guangxi, Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the province, as well as Zhang Huaijiu, Feng Yuxiang, and Yan Lisan, the acting chairman of Hubei Province, all sent generous contributions. Li Renzhong, Gan Jiaju, Li Da, Zhang Yingnan, and Xiong Zimin also acted as agents for his funeral affairs. These are all worthy of our gratitude. Mr. Xiong dedicated his life to the era. All that remains is a body of works and contributions in thought and scholarship.</p>

<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange saw a slight decline, but speculators continued to sell in the morning, because foreign firms continued to buy, so the underlying trend tightened.

HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced, and the exchange rates remained unchanged. There was no change in silver tax. Afterwards, because of rumors that a certain bank wanted to forcibly join a certain association, people's sentiment was slightly weak, so speculators re-entered the American exchange price for this month at 5.40625 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the black market for smelted gold turned into a stalemate, from falling to rising, and finally falling again. Although there were rumors that a certain bank wanted to forcibly join a certain association, the swap from February to March will be held tomorrow (the 14th). The buyers have suffered losses in the previous session, and the sentiment of all parties is not easy to stabilize. After opening in the morning, the selling momentum was strong, and the market fell to 6,445 yuan. Upon hearing favorable rumors, securities firms, draft merchants, Xinyuan, and Hengji, etc., advanced their positions, and the price flew up to more than 6,500 yuan, once reaching 6,525 yuan. Finally, because sellers were active, those who saw high prices came out in droves, falling by 50 yuan, and the price rose by only 3 yuan. Half-day trading totaled 6,700 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The cash price rose again. Initially, it was said that the term price had been 45 yuan higher. Hengji then offered Baokang 50 taels, 50 yuan higher. The cash number offered Xianghe 200 taels 55 yuan higher. Fukangyong sold 50 taels to Xianghe, 55 yuan higher, and then 50 taels 60 yuan higher. Hengji offered another large 20 taels plus 60 yuan.

<p>At the beginning of the morning, the market outside the market after the previous day's late closing was still quite active, so the opening price was only 6,470 yuan, 7 yuan smaller than the previous day. After opening, the price rose by 20 yuan thanks to the efforts of retail investors, to 6,490 yuan. When the foreign exchange market opened, it continued to be in a selling mood, causing Ren Chen, Chen Shui, Xinfeng, and Yong to sell vigorously, falling to 6,445 yuan. After a period of hovering, favorable rumors suddenly spread, and foreign exchange also slightly weakened, so the buying wind suddenly rose. China, Tongkangyong, Sui Fu, and Xinyuan all frantically bought, and the price was raised out of the 6,500 yuan mark, reaching 6,510 yuan. However, Yi Shi, Baokang, Xinfeng, and Yong took advantage of the high price and sold again, so it re-entered the 500 yuan mark, falling to 6,485 yuan. Afterwards, relying on Hengji, Dafeng, and others to pull again, it rose to the high peak of 6,525 yuan for the whole day. However, Chengren and the customers of the silver shop wanted to sell again, pressing it down to 6,475 yuan. The noon closing was 6,480 yuan, only 3 yuan higher than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon. The half-day fluctuation was 80 yuan. Based on the settlement price of 5.40625 yuan for the US dollar, it was about 6,441 yuan, a rise of about 40 yuan. The retail price of the cash number's own brand of gold must be 70 yuan higher than the term price, and the purchase price is 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current premium for gold is still without a price.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Grain: Rice Continues to Arrive, Rice Price Around Half a Yuan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s vessel, the Yisheng, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the holiday, carrying 4,470 bags from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. The Taikoo &amp; Co.'s vessel, the Hunan, arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 3,671 bags from Hong Kong. It is scheduled to sail to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession today to unload.</p>
<p>After foreign rice turned weak, although there was no major change, it has been falling continuously for several days. The market situation is weak. Merchants are wary of excessive inventory and are adopting a cautious approach, unwilling to rush into the market. On the other hand, they are also unwilling to lightly sell. Yesterday, in the sales market, only local shops were adding to their purchases. Sellers were unwilling to loosen their prices, so the overall situation from morning to noon remained hovering between three and five jiao. The closing price, compared to the previous market, except for small gains in prices, there was not much change. Other goods fell by about half a yuan. Foreign merchants were still selling in the market. It is said that there are 3,000 tons of broken rice for sale at 73 yuan. The market rose and then fell, and the result was slightly lower than before. However, large futures traders are holding firm, and the market remains stable. No. 1 Saigon February is 93.5 yuan, Xiaojiao is currently 86 yuan, January is 86 to 87 yuan, and February is 86.5 yuan. 6-700 tons were traded, and 8,000 bags of spot were opened.</p>
<p>Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica rice, was affected by foreign rice, and sales were sluggish. Therefore, sellers were unable to push prices up, and selling prices continued to depreciate by half a yuan. Changbang Yuanbai japonica rice opened at 105 yuan, 105 yuan, and a special appearance was 102.5 yuan, 102 yuan. Kunshan Yuanbai japonica rice was 103.5 yuan, 103 yuan, and a special appearance was 100 yuan, 98.5 yuan. Qingjiao thin indica rice, a special appearance was 94 yuan, 93.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of glutinous rice also turned scarce yesterday, and sellers were eager to sell, so the market was difficult to sustain. The price fell by nearly one yuan. Hong Kong special round grains opened at 81 yuan, 80 yuan, and Zhongguan was 79.5 yuan, 78.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Fewer Flour Imports <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The foreign flour market is showing a weakening trend because a large number of goods are on the way and will arrive soon. The supply of goods transshipped from Hong Kong is also continuous. Merchants' buying appetite is getting weaker, and sentiment is becoming more and more sluggish. In this area, there is still plenty of cheap flour supply, so the demand for foreign flour is even weaker. The entire market only opened with more than 500 bags of Lock Tower brand Australian flour, which has fallen into the 24 yuan mark. The price opened at 23.8 yuan, another decrease of 0.2 jiao compared to the previous day. The Beautiful brand was offered at 24 yuan. I heard that 200 bags of matching goods had been received. The cheap flour from the Yan factory is still 20 yuan for the local street to sell in small quantities.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Countless Malpractices by Rice Merchants <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of rice has soared tenfold, not only rice merchants and hoarders have profited handsomely, but the malpractices of Chinese and foreign ordering merchants are also very deep. There are no fewer than ten Chinese and foreign trading houses ordering rice. Ordering a ship of rice, from two to three thousand tons to seven or eight thousand tons, can earn a profit of one hundred thousand to two hundred seventy-eight thousand ninety thousand yuan. Each ton is estimated to have a profit of more than forty yuan, which is a huge amount exceeding the legal profit. According to the price in Saigon, the origin is about US$2.9 per 100 kilograms, plus a legal commission of 5%, US$0.145, shipping cost US$0.45, and insurance US$0.2, totaling US$3.695. Why is the Shanghai price 80 yuan outside? The secret of this is to be disclosed to the public.</p>
<p>(1) The hefty commission of Chinese and foreign ordering merchants controls the Shanghai rice market, and they do not do it without hefty profits. At least a 10% commission is charged, and 40% of the deposit is collected before the transaction is made, disregarding the authorities' legal profit of 5% and increasing the burden on citizens.</p>
<p>(2) Taking advantage of tricks. Whenever Shanghai's inventory is low, the market is soaring, and people are panicked, they often disregard credibility. According to the CIF example, they re-ship from the origin and settle the surplus difference, or sell spot goods to a third country, creating a food crisis in this port. Last year's Saigon No. 1 rice has not yet arrived, which is one example. General Chinese merchants are especially shameless. When the market rises, Xiaojiao rice is delivered to Dajiao rice, Hao rice is delivered to No. 1 rice, and No. 3 rice is delivered to Hao rice. The 40% deposit has become a fact, and they take whatever they want, regardless of the pain of others.</p>
<p>(3) Shortage of Weight: The law strictly prohibits unscrupulous merchants from shortchanging and deceiving customers, but it is a strange thing that the ordering merchants, when acting as officials, are shortchanging. Each bag weighs about 100 kilograms (there are large and small bags), and each ton has about 1,000 bags with zero. If you order 100 tons of foreign rice, and pay 80 yuan of legal currency per 100 kilograms, you pay a deposit of 12,000 yuan. When the ship arrives, you pay 1,015 bags and pay 48,000 yuan to be sufficient. However, the foreign firm must demand the remaining 15 bags of 1,200 yuan, pulling the original price of 81.2 yuan per bag. This 1.2 yuan is the unnamed loss of shortage of weight. In fact, what the Shanghai rice merchants ordered is the tonnage of 100 tons, regardless of whether it is 1,000 + tens of bags, and it is included in the tonnage. Therefore, it is calculated that 1,015 bags is 100 tons, without shortage of weight. Calculated with 1,000 bags plus 15 bags, each bag is short of 3 kilograms. In addition, the losses at the Shanghai docks are even more absurd. Chinese merchants actually deliver with 1,000 bags and sell the remaining 15 bags separately.</p>
<p>(4) Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees. Chinese and foreign ordering merchants charge miscellaneous fees, including insurance, military insurance, special military insurance, additional military insurance, foreign exchange swap losses, and various other fees. In fact, what the Shanghai rice merchants order is delivery at the Shanghai warehouse, Shanghai legal currency, and everything else should be borne by the seller, and they should not demand it on the pretext. They collude with brokers and issue cost notifications indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions are determined to eliminate the malpractices of rice merchants, it seems that they should not sit idly by and let the malpractices of ordering merchants reduce costs and alleviate the people's difficulties. They should order Chinese and foreign ordering merchants to submit the original English and Chinese documents of the origin, verify the original weight, submit the origin's insurance policy and military insurance policy and all expense bills, prepare a cost bill, and stipulate legal profits, so that the foundation can be strengthened, the source can be cleaned up, the price can be evaluated and limited, and there will be a real meaning.

<h3 id="e70">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Without Special Features, Actual Sales Still Sluggish <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is unpredictable, but actual transactions remain sluggish. The shorts are still active. As for the longs, because they have fallen back by more than 100 yuan, they think it has reached a considerable level and may as well buy again, so the long and short sides see it differently. At present, most people's psychology is to sell when it rises and buy when it is weak, so the ups and downs of yarn are still huge. The highest price was 1,425 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,396 yuan. In the afternoon, the price started at 1,412 yuan, and the average was 1,406 yuan. On the 13th, 40 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yangon and 25 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning. Because the popularity of the market turned high in the afternoon of the previous day, there were more buyers in the market. The first-board price was 1,410 yuan, a slight increase to 1,415 yuan. Then, because of short selling and settlements, the market suddenly turned downwards, to a low price of 1,396 yuan. At this point, short covering and temporary large amounts of orders resumed their activities, rising by 400 yuan. At the same time, the securities firms and gold firms became stronger, and rumors suddenly rose, all of which were favorable. In an instant, it rose to 1,425 yuan, but actual sales were still sluggish and without special features. Those who profited settled, and then fell back to 1,405 yuan. The closing price was 1,408 yuan. The statistics of the half-day transactions totaled 7,560 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 14 yuan. There were no transactions with the customer firms.</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is still not improving. This is because the yarn market is sluggish, and Japanese factories have no purchases at all. Most of them order directly from overseas, which is much cheaper, so it is very difficult for the cotton market to rise. On the 13th, 50 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In other news, the overseas cotton market, the New York cotton market, rose in the morning due to purchases by speculators and spot merchants. Afterwards, the closing price fell by 3-4 pounds due to some reactive selling. The Indian market was flat. Yesterday, the forecast was for a fall of one rupee.</p>
<p>The transactions of imported cotton in Shanghai have been very quiet recently. Because of the straight fall in cotton yarn, the cotton market has not improved. However, according to the current market situation, the cotton price will not fall as sharply as the yarn price, because the inventory of raw cotton on the market is not as excessive as that of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Piece Goods: Cloth Falling Continuously, Industry Players Add to Positions <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market turned firm after falling yesterday. This is because the sharp fall in the past few days has caused customers to purchase and industry players to cover their positions. The holders are also raising prices and unwilling to sell cheaply, so the selling pressure has slightly rebounded. White coarse cloth has rebounded by about 0.15 yuan per bolt, and fine cloth and fine twill have risen by about 0.5 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth remains flat. The local street traded more than 300 pieces of various cloths. Zhejiang firms traded more than 100 pieces of Fuchou and Shilin cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong firms traded more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 365 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong and 11 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Because the yarn price rebounded yesterday, the East cloth market turned firm. The spot market for white goods, cage heads, and fine cloth has been changed to full-day operation, rising and falling sharply, hovering around 47 yuan. The closing price was 47.1 yuan. (Exchange) The closing price for futures in the afternoon was 47.6 yuan for February, 49.11 yuan for March, 50.066 yuan for April, and 51.4 yuan for May.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Securities: Bond Market Still Weak <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds: yesterday, rumors suddenly arose in the port, and people's sentiment was already unstable. After being hit, it became even weaker. The market was flat and weak in the morning, and a sharp drop occurred in the afternoon, falling by more than one yuan. The market was mostly floating and unreal, and weak. A slight rumor would cause a fall, because many in the financial sector have surrendered in recent days, and the footing is too loose. Also, there are not many powerful people this year, so the formation is easily shaken. Yesterday morning, most of the sellers, such as Nos. 16 Xinhua, 38 Hengkang, and Tiansheng Hongda Zhenkang, were spot outflows. Renchang and Hu bought a lot, but they were afraid that it would be difficult to maintain. The noon closing was quite flat and weak. In the afternoon, there was a matter of the Market Chamber of Commerce, which had nothing to do with the bond market, but one virtuality led to a hundred virtualities, and most people turned pale at the mention of it, which caused an unnecessary fall. The resales of Tongkang, Hengfu, Lianyi, Yuxing, Hengkang, Hongda, and Renchang filled the market with selling pressure, while the buyers, such as Tongxing Lianhe and Juxin, were mostly covering their positions. Some retail investors bought in small quantities, and the market price fell sharply by more than one yuan. As a result, all were less than one yuan. Category D was down by 0.15 jiao in the morning because it was not done in the afternoon. The turnover was about 3.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of China Match Company were traded at a price of 34.25 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot transactions of oilseed cakes were still very few. The futures market was entirely controlled by speculation. The trend of the day, first inheriting the previous day's weak situation, the oil market fell by another yuan, and the bean cakes continued to fall by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. After entering, the market price rose repeatedly due to the usual style of the four firms. As a result, the futures oil exceeded the previous day's market price, and the futures cake also turned up beyond expectations. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 2,000 containers of Jiangbei local workshop total raw oil, 200 loads of Dayou factory bean oil, and 30 barrels of current Dalian oil were opened, with 100 barrels ordered for delivery in the lower part of February, 200 barrels in the upper part of March, 150 barrels in the lower part of March, and more than 60,000 pieces of various brands of futures cake.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was generally flat. The public association's prices for spot: 4 coarse white, 81 yuan for local warehouse, 80.8 yuan for foreign warehouse, lacked ups and downs. The order at the end of February was softer at 81 to 80.9 yuan, and the order for March + 10 days was 81.2 to 81.15 jiao, and a small 2.5 jiao. Dutch cotton white KD brand local warehouse was 80 yuan, and Dutch red was 62.5 yuan, down 0.5 jiao. Tai brand white B brand order in February + 10 days was 80 yuan, DY brand West warehouse was 78.6 jiao, up 0.2 jiao, and East warehouse was 78 yuan. HX brand was 78.3 jiao, up 0.1 jiao. The Benchang cotton white Zhenji No. 4 goods opened at 74.5 yuan, No. 1 ice was 102.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 103.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Guotang Diaoging rose slightly because it had been in short supply for a long time, but there were no transactions.</p>

<p>Because the source of Qiaohong tangerine peel has been lacking for a long time, the stock on the market is almost exhausted. It is found that only Chen Ju has a little stock. The price has risen by more than ten yuan, but it has not yet been traded. New goods cannot be delivered due to inconvenient transportation. Although telegrams have been sent to urge delivery, they have not yet arrived. The first market is bound to be expensive.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Gas Company of the Public Concession has applied to the authorities of the two concessions to increase the temporary surcharge from 158% to 250% from the 15th of this month, limited to three months, due to the soaring price of gas and insufficient operating surplus to maintain shareholder interests. The matter will be re-examined at that time based on the general situation. It is now learned that the authorities of the two concessions have approved the company's request, but with the following provisions:</p>
<p>Revising Rates After Three Months</p>
<p>(1) The rate shall be re-established before April 15, 1941, after investigation according to the provisions of Section 3 below. (2) The public shall be notified of the price increase no later than January 15, 1941. (3) The review of the company's proposed minimum fixed gas period and the increase in security deposits for new customers in January 1941 shall be delayed until the bureau's investigation yields results, in order to verify whether the increase in gas costs borne by industrial users under the company's current rates is fair. (4) The minimum consumption volume on household gas bills shall be increased to 1,500 cubic feet. As for industrial users, their minimum sales volume shall be equal to 20% of the monthly nominal quota per meter.</p>
<p>Separate Office for Concession Appliances</p>
<p>(5) The company may temporarily suspend the rental of appliances, and new users shall purchase them from the company at cost. However, when this method is implemented, if existing users request to move their appliances elsewhere, the company shall not recognize them as new users, and the repair costs of the appliances shall still be borne by the users. The company shall rent the gas meters to the users while retaining ownership of the meters. (6) The current reduced fee method for users who use gas for heating, hot water, and cooking purposes shall be cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="e82">China Resolves to Block Japan's Southern Advance - Mr. Song Ziwen's Remarks in New York <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports: Dr. Song Ziwen delivered a speech at the China Institute in New York on January 23, discussing the difficulties encountered by the Japanese army in the Sino-Japanese War. According to Song, China's vast territory and potential manpower will make it impossible for the invaders to carry out their blitzkrieg tactics. Although the other side initially hoped to devastate all of China within a few months, this plan ultimately failed. The following is a summary of Mr. Song's speech.</p>
<p>About seven years ago, on my way to London to attend the economic conference, I discussed with you the issue of the Japanese army's seizure of Manchuria. At that time, I said that although the Manchurian issue was not considered urgent by some, it was the first international act of plunder in many years. If it is not condemned, its impact will create a precedent for similar illegal acts elsewhere, until the whole world is engulfed in a common conflagration. When I arrived in London, I spoke with the same sentiment to the China Aid Committee of the House of Commons, which was chaired by Foreign Secretary Sir Simon. I quoted a passage from the historical essay by the British writer Macaulay, which described how Frederick the Great seized Silesia from Austria after years of peace in Europe, thus causing the "Seven Years' War," and the war spread almost all over the world. "Blacks fought on the coast of Cameroon, and Indians killed each other on the shores of the Great Lakes in North America." When we see today's world in the midst of war.</p>
<p>Deeply Pleased that China's Leaders are Talented</p>
<p>I am deeply grieved that what I said seven years ago has unfortunately come true. But I am pleased to recall the second point I made at the time, namely that Japan's aggression would become a hammer forging China's unity, and that China would find its national soul at the cost of blood, flesh, and material losses. It is fortunate that China has leaders such as General Chiang Kai-shek to lead everything in the greatest crisis of national life. Under the combination of Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoe, we are fortunate to have outstanding leaders such as Churchill and General Chiang Kai-shek, and great figures such as Roosevelt as their supporters. We often think that General Chiang Kai-shek is only a soldier, but in fact, Chiang is not only a soldier, but also a politician who understands the intricate factors in the war, as well as the various political and material forces within it. We must note that it is better to call Chiang a politician than a soldier. Chiang is very different from the Japanese warlords, because Chiang does not use war as a means to achieve the goals desired by politicians.</p>
<p>Japan's Aggression is Reckless</p>
<p>In 1937, when Japan launched a war against China, it was a reckless act. At that time, Konoe told some of his own people and foreign reporters that he would make China kneel in three months. What he meant was the so-called "blitzkrieg" that is generally called today. But the Japanese only know about themselves and do not know about others. We know that time is on China's side. Time will exhaust Japan's resources, because it is self-evident that the Japanese resources will be exhausted to maintain its world's third largest navy, as well as the supply of millions of troops and thousands of aircraft in a state of war. The Chinese nation must take a considerable amount of time to exert its huge and solid strength, and time can enable the democratic countries to understand that China's combat is not only for its own interests, but also for the common interests of the democratic countries. The democratic countries will be happy to help China when they are aware of this.</p>
<p>Unable to Control Occupied Areas</p>
<p>Today, if you look at the map of China, you will see a huge ugly shape, which is generally called the Japanese-occupied area, but the Japanese occupation of these lands is only a superficial state. Although the major cities are occupied by the Japanese, the land a few miles outside the city is still in the hands of the Chinese government. The Chinese government collects taxes, circulates currency, issues orders, and adjudicates lawsuits. At the same time, although the Japanese occupy railways and some important highways, there are Chinese troops and guerrillas stationed on both sides of the roads, who constantly destroy bridges, demolish rails, and ambush and annihilate the most distant outposts of the Japanese army. The west reaches Yichang, but in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, etc., there are several Chinese regular armies just a few miles away.</p>
<p>Southern Ambitions are Like a Dream</p>
<p>The agreement recently signed by the Axis powers to divide spheres of influence is like the attempt by Spain and Portugal in 1493 to divide the world. The objects that Japan has been assigned are vast in area, including China and various parts of the South Pacific, such as Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, India, Australia and New Zealand. This is truly like a greedy golden dream. But Japan has not even gotten its hands on the fortifications, even Singapore has not been captured. If the port does not have the British main fleet, and only relies on the naval detachments of Australia and the Netherlands for protection, it will naturally not be a match for the enemy with Japan's entire navy and air force and the army as a backup. If Singapore is attacked, the massive and formidable battle fleet of the United States must of course be taken into account, but in Japan's mind, it is attacking Singapore at the same time as its Axis partners are attacking Britain, Gibraltar and Suez, which will aggravate the Atlantic crisis, and the United States may turn a blind eye to Singapore. Although Japan's fleet and air force are still intact, its army is not enough to support and consolidate a huge southern advance plan.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Seeking Peace is a Conspiracy</p>
<p>According to estimates by military experts in neutral countries, the number of Japanese soldiers who have died in battle, died of illness, and been permanently disabled in China is more than 1.1 million. In addition, there are still 1.25 million troops tied down in China, not counting the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria to defend against the Soviet Union. Therefore, military experts believe that because the soldiers who have gone to war have not returned, there is little encouragement for new adventures in Japan. (To be continued)</p>
