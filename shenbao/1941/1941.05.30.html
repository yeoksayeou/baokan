<p>社評美總統談話所引起的反應</p>
<p>羅斯福總統前天那一具有歷史意義的談話發出之後，迅即傳遍世界各個角落，引起種種不同的波動和反應；的略言之，在民主國及其人民方面，一般都表示着欣慰滿意，而於羅氏對於此後具體步驟之未能明白宣示，間或微表遺憾之意；在侵略國家，則大都繼續日前李德爾對美恫嚇之詞，但也不能盡掩內心的惶悸，準此而論，可見美當局所宣示的態度，縱也引起侵略者的敵意，而若十殷切期望美國明白表示其未來計劃者則尙感未足，關於於這種情形，實有進一步加以剖析和解釋的必要。</p>
<p>細繹美國種種動態，對於當前局勢早具有堅定不拔的立塲，質言之，即擊敗侵略者，扶助民治國家作戰勝利的完成，這一羅斯福的根本抱負，遠在歐戰未經發生之前，即業已一再有所宣示；至於其實際的運用，則外須適應國際形勢的發展，內要適應本國的實力與輿情，因而有時未必盡能完全滿足若干人士的要求。假如美國能在去夏法國敗北萊諾向美呼籲之際，能立以數千飛機接濟法國，說不定可能挽救貢比臬一慕悲劇，其效果自非此際之支援在苦戰中的英軍所能比擬，但那却是彼時美國輿情與國防生產能力所允許，於此可以瞭解美當局自有其小得已的苦衷，苛責只是徒然。這一年中，美國從決定竭力援助民治國作戰到宣布全國緊急狀態的存在，在美國的政治傳統上已經是飛躍，較之國際局勢的各方發展却不能算很快，但在克服內外阻力方面已屬盡了最大的努力和呂心，即在羅斯福隔昨那一談話中，旣較斥閉關派的和平謬見，更警告美國調解工業糾紛的機構須早日實行工作，可見即在業巳臨到戰爭邊沿之際，還有若干內部問題需要顧慮。不過這些問題，眞臨到重大的決定關頭，可斷言其並不能發生何等有力的阻撓牽制作用。現在美國以非交戰國的地位則言，其支援民治國家的舉措貫已達到最大限度，再進一步只有參戰；此際美當局顯然不願把參戰一舉放到種種有效措施之前，雖然緊急狀態的存在已然表示着美國臨到作戰的前夜。假如侵略國家一定要把美國從戰爭邊緣推進戰爭漩渦，則美國不只在所不辭，且亦有備無患；髯自在實際上巳從事於變相的作戰，却小肯自已先在形式上採取着戰爭的姿態，這大槪是此際美當局的根本信念。至於援英戰具之如伺送達，究將採取護航抑或運用最近成立的「特務艦隊」從事搜索，那是美方國務院當前要縝密考慮的問題，在方式上也許並非一成不變。無限制的緊急狀態旣經存在，羅斯福總統巳取得了除却參戰而外的種種權力，對於未來的發展和步驟可想像其必經籌之已熟，縱然在談話未作具體的宣示，在這一點上他可以充分運用他自已的權力。</p>
<p>美當局的堅決態度之在軸心方面引起强烈衝動自屬當然，但其能力究能實行李德爾的恫嚇大言到何等程度則尙為疑問。俾斯麥號的沉沒，證明了英國海上權威之不容輕侮，德國爭取大西洋霸權的企圖只是幻滅了的空想。固然希特勒不甘坐視援英戰具的到達，而其海上實力確不能達到完全加以阻撓的效果；目的固難得遂，反而徒然得到多樹立一個交戰敵國的後果，如是納粹當局不願過分意氣用事，就不能小做重大的考慮。上决大戰中，帝德當局關於緩和美國因海上糾紛而參戰，曾盡過許多努力，納粹當局未必竟沒有帝德時代聰明吧；另一方面，這又自然是用着三國盟的的時候，李德爾日前談話恰好是向着同盟社記者發　，大槪也非出偶然。連日東京論調頗見浮動，且一再發現久見沉寂的炎炎大言，這可以意料是出於德日間為了應付美國的一種默契，而美國總統在談話中或讚中國的作戰並保證予中國以額外援助，無疑也正是針對着三國盟的的援用。最近松岡一派對華對英美的溫和政策失敗後，又是軍人派的强硬對華對美論佔了上風，然而連最近發動的對華大規模軍事攻勢且陷於進退維谷，侈言對美作戰，其現實意義實甚薄弱，俾士麥號的沈沒證明了優良傳統比較軍艦本身的堅强更有決定性。姑無論侵略國家的强硬姿態並不足以嚇退美國，即使其竟由姿態而進於實踐，則以今日民治國家力量的總和，應付盟的國的共同攻勢，成敗利鈍之數，也並不是個難予斷定的問題。</p>
<h3>羅斯福未提日本謂具有重大意義</h3>
<p>華盛頓　據在羅斯福總統兩日前發表其廣播演說前數小時、曾與其晤談之負責各議員談稱、政府人士漸信日本之參加軸心國、或將不久趨於衰微、彼等舉羅總統在其廣播演詞中未提及太平洋問題為證、彼等之信念、係根據　業　關現在東京逐漸得勢之消息、或終將使軍閥受其影響、參院外交委員會主席益議員喬治曾表示意兒、　為羅總統之未討論太平洋、實具有重大意義、渠意遠東局勢或將稍生變化、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>威爾基全力擁護總統宣示之政策</h3>
<p>紐約　共和黨領袖威爾基、昨晚對羅總統星期二晚所發之爐旁談話、給與全力擁護、威氐曾預備一文告謂、「總統巳將吾人所須聽者以極好之言詞道之、總統對於納粹戰勝英國後對於美國經濟上社會上政治上及軍事上之影響認職、甚為明白　正確、總統並將以前並未發表之事實、宣示吾人、以表明英國情形嚴重、吾人之外交政策、父經宣布、現時吾人無論為共和黨為民主黨或為新政者、皆應聯合一致、共同使</p>
<h3>渝各報熱烈讚美羅斯福爐邊談話</h3>
<p>重慶　今晨各報、均以第一條新聞地位、刋載羅斯福演說、並於評論中熱烈加以讚美、中央日報云、「美國元首已有最後決心、而美國保衛自由、亦巳達最後關頭、在這篇演說發表前、美國尙只是民主國兵工廠、在發表伖、我們相信美已步入全面行動時期、美國若未被被征服、中英兩國的抗戰、不會失敗、換句話說我們深信中英已獲得勝利的保證」、又云「羅氏為古今中外有數偉大之政治家、此時担任美國元首、旣是美國人民的幸運、亦是世界民主各國的幸運」、大公報謂、讀此大演說後、可知美國中立已成過去、轉而進入戰時體制、充任民主主義最後堡壘、惟演詞未特別道及日本、難免被日本誤認為有意規避、</p>
<h3>義評論羅氏演說仍爲其賣弄慣技</h3>
<p>羅馬　此間消息靈通方面昨夜評羅斯福總統之演說稱、該項演詞公布之方式、與美國之選舉運動的略相同（以英國而論、對於羅氏之演說、未免失望、因美關並未參戰、僅宣佈緊急狀態、羅氏所申述之理由、僅備國內人民諦聽之用、可見美國反戰派尙相當有努力、羅氏言論之焦點、仍為倘軸心國勝利、美國所遭受之威脅及極權制度之威嚇歐洲、反之、民主主義則不然、羅氏稱美國之社會改革已見進步、但對軸心國社會改革之進步、則予以忽視、未免矛盾、羅氏承認英國所喪失之商船、比所造者、超出三倍、比央美所造者高出一倍、至於為海上自由面奮鬥而言、軸心國之作戰亦即為此、總而官之、該項演詞、係依照羅氏政策之舊貫、使美人相信、美國必須參戰云、（二十九日海通社電）</p>
<p>羅馬　美國新聞報主筆蓋達評羅斯福總統之演說稱、羅氏賣弄其慣技、對於英國出讓西牛球領土之報答、僅稱願予英國援助、但未作具體之表示、羅斯福所下之決斷、非視英國之需要、而視美國之利益為轉移、羅氏之演說、矛盾之處甚多、其理由即美國參戰派所欲言者其日的為以防禦為名、而行侵略之實云、（二十九日海通社電）</p>

<p>東京　日本時報廣知報載有批評美總統演詞之社論、題為「在戰爭邊際」、謂美總統詞中毫無中立痕跡、但表示堅決反對希特勒之立塲、甚至發反抗英國領海中德權利之諾言、美國今巳晚除最後的中立形跡、其致之者非為中立法案所表示之民意、但為總統之言行云、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　國民新聞與報知新聞均責羅斯福總統、表示以更有力之援助給予蔣介石之言論、報知新聞日、美國今巳敢明白表露仇對日本矣、美國當懷日本現居之地位、巳能被迫取各種有效方法、對付敵意恫赫、國民新聞謂美國巳表示彼為建設大東亞共榮圈之仇敵、日本對此不能束手旁觀、都新聞則促羅總統軍行考慮美國援助現困居重慶之蔣政府、蓋此傘之結果、徒使中國許多兆人民續受戰禍耳、否則美國必須負責亂遠東和平之咎、護賣聽聞謂羅斯福總統之演說中之政治臭味、不足介意、蓋其言一方面志在恫嚇軸心國、一方面志在煽動國內參戰之在熱云、（廿九路透社電）</p>

<h3>英認美民眾將予總統便宜行事權</h3>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員稱、倫敦某發言人昨日所發美總統已着手備戰之評語、可概括一般人對於總統演詞之印象、英國民衆認此演詞、可使美國民衆予其元首以便宜行事之權、倫敦人士到於海上自出之宣布、允為注意、以為此語不僅至關重要、且亦為美總統政治手腕異常敏捷之證、因總統於衆人爭論運送援英戰具事之時、以解決租軍案之簡單方式破此糾紛也、總統未詳示護航辦法、但宣布海上自由之廣大基本政策、而將關於護航之各事悉包括其中、故其重要性較宣示護航詳情為允大、美國境內所具軸心國定不歡迎總統演詞之預測、此間人士認為正確、因此演詞不獨切實保證對英之援助、且分析希</p>
<h3>德外部發言人稱該演說毫不足奇</h3>
<p>柏林　德外部發言人昨夜評羅斯福總統之演說、稱為「不動人」、所談者、僅為戰事之發展、及交戰國之地位、求言及助英之具體辦法、德國之立塲、由元首在國會之演說及海軍總司令雷德上將到軍盟社發表之談話、已言之甚詳、羅氏對於保持海上自由一層、即美國有權可將軍火隨意運輸、但對於交戰國為平民攫取給養之自由、及保障中立國之貿易二事、則完全忽略、至於甫北美洲被德國威脅一事、實屬一片胡言、關於宣佈緊急狀態、此乃與美國人民直接發生關關、即削減人民若干自由權而增大總統之權力、吾人無驚惶之必耍云、（二十九日海通社電）</p>
<p>柏林　德外部發言人本日宜稱、羅斯福總統之演詞最中要之點、當為宜吿全國處於無限制之緊急狀態中、易言之、美國政府為謀增强英國對德作戰之利益計、將要求美國人民作更大犧牲是也、又稱羅氏嗣吿外報記者、本人無意廢除中立法、柏林對此言已予以注意、惟認為此言與其演詞似未能契合云、（二十九日海通電）</p>

<h3>公共租界水電煤氣　自七月起再增價</h3>
<p>電加附加費百分之五十</p>
<p>水增至百分之二百五十</p>
<p>煤氣則限制用量超過須加數倍取費</p>
<p>本埠公共租界上海電力公司。上海自來水公司及上海自來火公司。三大公用專業機關、前以特價暴漲、開支浩大、乃呈請工部局董事會核准酌加月費或限制消耗、當由董事會將此案交由公共事業委員會討論、經該會於本星期一召集常會、審查各該公司所呈報告及原案後、認為所請尚無不合、乃通過增加水電用費及限制自來火（煤氣）消耗數量辦法、復於前日由董事會例會批准、定自本年七月一日起實行、唯本市人民、以水電煤氣各費暴漲不已、生活負担、日益加重、希望當局能作最後之考慮、價量減輕市民生活負擔、茲將各項辦法、分誌於後。</p>
<p>電費加價</p>
<p>據工部局發表、本局前據上海電力公司呈、以物價與水脚等等、繼續昂騰、以是各項營業用費、無不激增、應付為難、用是呈請本局准在現行[燃料]與[匯兑]附加費以外、對於各類用户、加徵基本電費之[臨時]附加費百分之五十、藉資挹注、此項新附加費之核算、將以美金五元二角五分折合國幣一百元之匯價為依據、附加費數額之高下、按月由本局與該公司按照現行[匯兑]附加費之計算方法、酌核調　。</p>
<p>應用物品</p>
<p>無不高漲</p>
<p>查該公司各項用物品、幾無一不購自國外、而電費之增加、比諸本埠生活費用之高漲情形、相形見絀、譬如二號粳米、在一九二八年每石為九元二角七分者、在本年五月二日，則已增至一百二十五元、計漲十二倍有奇、又如同年煤斤每噸為十二元三角二分者、在本年五月二日漲至一百七十五元零三分、較增十二倍許、　該公司所收一般小住宅用户之電費、在一九二八年每月為三元零八分者、本年為九元五角五分、計增百分之二二○、又如大住宅用户之電費、在同年每月為二十五元九角者、本年為九十七元五角五分、計增百分之二七七、又如小工廠之電費、在同年每月為一百五十四元者、本年為六百三十五元五角二分、計增百分三一三、又如大工廠之電費、在同年每月為二萬八千餘元者、本年為十二萬三千餘元、計增百分之四七一、</p>
<p>新附加費</p>
<p>業經核准</p>
<p>參閱該公司附呈國外各埠、如東京.尼　.香港.以及本埠法租界.　北等處之電費比較表、可知該公司所收電費、（包括各項附加費連同本案之附加費在內、）除法租界以外、誠屬最為低廉、案經本局公用事業委員會提出詳細討論、結果認為該公司所請加價一節、核　特許營業章程、尚無不合、應准照辦、業經轉呈本局董事會本月二十八日例會通過、准自各用户用電期在本年七月一日或同日以後終止之日起實行、再新附加費、僅適用於基本電費、合併聲明。</p>
<p>水費增加</p>
<p>據工部局發表、茲據上海自來水公司呈以近來物價續漲、尤以燃料與電力之費用為最、同時、發給職工津貼、數亦較增、一以致各項開支、罔不激增、維持為難、用是檢附本年度收支預算書表、呈請本局准將自來水附加費、由百分之一一○提增至百分之二五○、以裕收入、藉資挹注、同時得以應付營業章程規定發給之英金股息、並提撥公司資產之折舊、案經本局公用事業委員會討論、結果認為該公司所請加價一節、核與特許營業章程之規定、並無不合、應准照加、業經轉呈本局董事會本月二十八日例會通過、准自各用户用水期在本年七月一日或同日以後終止之日實行</p>
<p>煤氣用量</p>
<p>據工部局發表、查上海自來火公司、鑒於燃料之供給情形、捉摸不定、為防止煤氣之消耗、超過上年度之用量起見、　經呈請本局准予實施限制煤氣消費辦法、案經本局公用事業委員會討論以後、認為所請尚無不合、應凖照辦、業經轉呈本局董事會、於本月一十八日開會通過、准予實行、其辦法如下、</p>
<p>新申請書</p>
<p>一概拒絕</p>
<p>一自本年六月一日起、凡請求供給工業煤氣之新申請書、概予拒絕、此外請求供給家庭煤氣之新申請書、倘查有為經濟着想、需要改用煤氣、以代其他燃料之情形者、亦在拒絕之列、</p>
<p>超過限度</p>
<p>分别收費</p>
<p>二自使用煤氣期在本年六月一日或同日以後開始之日起、任何用户之每月煤氣消費、限止不得超過上年同一用期之消費量、倘屬不能、則限於本年內以前一期之消費量、倘再不能、則限於經公司估計之相當需要數量、超過此項限度時、其超越部份之取費如下、（甲）第一次超過限度（一個月）、按現行收費率加倍取費、（乙）第二次超過限度（一個月）、按現行收費率三倍取費、（丙）第三次及後繼之超越（一個月）、按現行收費率四倍取費、以上各項辦法、係屬臨時性質、得隨時提出修改或廢止之、用户之每月准許消費量、當由公司方面分别通知、至於按照上開第二項辦法所加收之費、將由該公司劃入準備金項下、用於經本局與該公司同意之有利於用户之用　、</p>
<p>電力與煤氣</p>
<p>最低收費額</p>
<p>據工部局發表、查上海電力公司與上海自來火公司對於各用户之收費、會有應付最低額之規定、此項辦法、最近曾經本局公用專業委員會加以考量、據上海電力公司表示、就經濟觀點而言、　項收費辦法、確屬需要、第以目前正在切盼公眾節減用電、擬將上項辦法、在燃料緊急時期內、除對於大量用户以外、暫予停止、　便公司遭受損失、在所不計、同時、上海自來火公司主張將此項辦法仍予保留、否則將使公司收入、大為減縮、以致引起議增附加費、補償收入之短絀、本案公用事業委員會認為以上兩公司之情形、完全不同、緣電力公司因目前燃料供給失常、均　請一般不受減電限制之用户、自動節電、而自來火公司則僅欲使煤氣消費、不致超出上年度之用量、至就家庭用户之消費量而言、此項消費量、在電力公司之電力產量中僅占一小部份、而在自來火公司之煤氣產量中、則占有百分之七十左右、在原則方面、前項收費辦法、應予保留、但為避免妨害節者消耗起見、此項費額、應即按照消耗之節減成數、加以核減、用是建議將電力公司之電費最低額、減至現行數額之百分之七十、此後視情形如何、再行調整、同時自來火公司之此項收費辦法、仍准保留、但倘實行節減消費、則其收費之最低額、亦應照減、上項建議、業經本局董事會本月二十八日例會認可矣、</p>

<h3>米商訂購貢米已達一萬餘噸　係下月期貨到埠即發售　港米與貢米質地有區别</h3>
<p>據工部局公告查最近本埠各報、對於法租界公董局所運西貢碎米、將以每包一百另八元或每石約八十七元之價格發售一節、發表意見、關於此層、應請注意者、即上項價格與本局洋米（仰光特别小絞）售價之間、有所區别者、僅為由於米質之各異、以上兩種洋米因本質之不同、故在本埠市場上、開價亦異、試觀下列、比較則事實顯然、計五月二十日計仰光米為一○四元、西貢碎米為八十一元、五月二十六日仰光米為一一五元、西貢碎米為九十三元、</p>
<p>訂購貢米</p>
<p>先付定洋</p>
<p>法公董局採辦運滬之西貢一二號混合碎米、由上海方面之進口委員會及西貢方面之出口委員會負責辦理、而法公董局與越南政府處於監督地位、以統制之、凡本埠經營越南洋米之外商洋行、以後不能與本市米商私自交易、務須加入進口委員會、方能辦理是項貢米交易事宜、故目前參加進口委員會之洋行、已有達孚合　等四十家、是項貢米、係六月份期貨、須至下月一日至三十日間、始能裝運來滬、現各雜量行向進口委員會訂購貢米、須先付定洋五成、而各零售米號向雜糧行購買、亦須付定洋三成至五成、至各進口委員會洋行成交之數額、須逐日向法公董局審閱備案、據米業界消息、目前各雜糧行向進口委員會洋行訂購貢米之數量、約在一萬噸以上、至於是項貢米何日抵埠發售、目前尚雖確定、惟以西貢駛滬之船隻、至多不過十二日、</p>
<p>港米批價</p>
<p>略予提高</p>
<p>公共租界工部局根據本市各米號家向祥茂洋行退回每包米糧不足二百二十四磅貨款之統計、該局出售之洋米、每包平均虧蝕數量約一磅半左右、而該局出售與各批發米行每包之價格為一百二十二元九角一分、各批發米行售與各米號之價格為一百三十三元五角、每包可獲利潤達十元零五角九分、較之米號家所得百分之四之利潤、增加倍餘、當局為彌補因辦理是項米糧不足之開支起見、特於昨日起、各批發米行訂購工部局洋米之價格、每包由一百二十二元九角一分增至一百二十四元七角、計每包增加一元七角九分、但售與米號之價格、每包仍定為一百三十三元五角、門市每石仍為一百十元、</p>
<p>不付米款</p>
<p>取銷售權</p>
<p>前日祥茂洋行奉工部局　、取消本埠兩租界內三十三家米號發售平價港米之權利、據平明社記者所悉、其被處刑之原因、為不依照訂購手續、而遲遲不往祥茂洋行付款之故、昨日見報後、即紛紛前往祥茂洋行要求、聞工部局已許可通商、福泰新.晋盛昌.裕成泰.公盛昌.顧昌盛.和順公.泰山.等八家米號、恢復其發售港米獲利、昨已付款出貨應市、祥茂洋行已定於六月一日遞地辦公、新址為外灘一號亞細亞火油公司大樓六樓、又據裕大豐米號函稱該號並未接到工部局停售港米處分之通知照常營業云、</p>
<p>怠工職工</p>

<h3>剖腦目睹記　王顯理</h3>
<p>昨晚在梦中看見了一顆血淋淋的人頭。</p>
<p>自從對心理學發生了興趣以後，對於自己所做的梦，總喜歡拿來分析一下，尋根究底，多數的時候總算把梦的來源找了出來，使自己的心中[如釋重負。]</p>
<p>這一次當然也不能例外，剛要分析，心裏就　覺好笑，昨天不是親眼看見粟醫生在剖人頭嗎？而且不折不扣地看了兩個半鐘頭！</p>
<p>很早就親見今日醫術的昌明，已經到能夠解剖　部的地步了，總是以没有親眼看見為憾。有一次碰到紅十字會的神經精神病科主任粟寧波聲醫生，知道他是會開腦子的，我就把想看腦部開刀手術的意思告訴他，没料到他竟一口答應，說下一次有機會的時候一定來通知我。</p>
<p>就在前天的下午，有一位女護士打了一個電話來通知，說粟醫生明天下午二時要開刀，叫我去看。</p>
<p>我心中　覺好笑，粟醫生開刀竟慎重其事地叫護士打電話來約，好像是請吃飯或請看電影似的。好！我決不失誤了這千載難逢的機會。</p>
<p>二十二日下午二時，　五月的炎陽底下走進了海格路的紅十字會醫院。在開刀　中，見到了粟宗聲醫師，已經穿好了白衣白褲，正在白瓷水槽邊賣力地用肥皂毛刷洗刷子手臂。他看見我，就滿臉笑容地替我介紹另外的兩位醫師和幾位護士小姐。一位身材高大的醫生對我說，[你不怕嗎？]我一時不知道該怎樣回答，我勉强說[我想我不怕。]</p>
<p>另外一位助理醫師把我帶進更衣室中去，我把外衣脱去，他替我戴上白布　，罩上白布的口鼻罩，套上雪白的短衣。我對鏡自照，儼然也是一位醫生了！一位冒牌的醫生。</p>
<p>管理手術室的小姐到更衣室裏來，懷疑地問我道，[你真的不怕嗎？]她說明開刀向來是不能隨便讓人看的，現在既然是粟醫師請來的，就馬馬虎虎，不過[你真的不怕嗎？]她睜大着眼用英文問了。我不知如何是好，我還是回答那麼一句：[我想我真的不怕。]帶我進更衣室的醫生　　嘴說，[你怕就告訴我。]我點點頭。</p>
<p>出更衣室，粟醫師依舊在洗刷手臂。他說普通在開刀以前，總要花半小時以上的時間去洗刷手臂，用肥皂洗好以後不夠，還要用藥水洗，藥水洗過以後，要剪指甲、指甲剪好以後，還要再洗，洗好以後用酒精揩幹，然後帶上手套。</p>
<p>粟醫師一面叫一位助手到辦公室中去把桌上的骷髏樣本拿來，一面說病人是一位四五十歲的婦人，在兩年前來看病以前，說患右頰神經痛好久了，起初用打針法診治，可是打了針總不是根治的辦法。到一星期前，這位病人又來求治了，因為痛楚非凡的緣故，已經幾日幾夜不眠不食了。粟醫師表示開刀才是根治的辦法，病人表示願意，她的決心正表現了她所受苦楚的深重。</p>
<p>骷髏標本的頭頂骨，已經鋸去了一半，　骨用一根繩子連　着，嘴巴可以一開一合，儼然是電影中的恐怖鏡頭。粟醫師還在洗他的手，叫助手把他所要動手術的部份指給我們看，並說明穿過右頰骨的三套神經的來蹤去跡。</p>
<p>二點十五分，幾位白衣天使，蜂擁着把病人從另外一間房裏推進手術室，我們也尾隨着跟進去，雪白的手術室一時忙碌了起來，病人全身裹着白布，已經受了全身麻醉，頭上右面的頭發已經完全剃去了，在手術桌上熟睡着，不時發出鼾聲。</p>
<p>手術室是方形再加個半圓形的，半圓的部份，全部裝着白紗玻璃窗，使光線能夠透射進來。手術桌的上面，照　着六盞光亮的電燈。手術桌旁，擺着兩個放紗布，棉花，藥品，和一切開刀工具的盤架，由一位護士管理　。</p>
<p>施行手術以前，一位助理醫師割破病人經部的血管，用滴注法替她輸葡萄糖和鹽水，以防流血過多或其他的意外。另一位護士坐在病人的左邊，注意病人的脈搏和血壓。</p>
<p>二點二十五分，是手術室中空氣最緊張的時候，粟醫師在兩位助理醫師，五位護士小組的幫助下，在另外兩位醫師和我這冒牌的醫師的注視下，在病人的頭上動起手術來了。</p>

<h3>糧食　米囤戶屢思蠢動　幸到來絡繹而來志不得逞</h3>
<p>洋米昨巿初漲後跌、市面仍居盤旋局勢、早巿漲二三元、午市回小元許、下午進出兩稀、市乏軒輊、結果僅比前晚祇大一元至二元而巳、早展因太平洋風雲、買氣頗見濃厚、而日商之轉口與本街內地均有點綴、囤戶異常興奮、小絞開價即至一百二十元高至一百二十元零五角、西貢一號至一百二十六元、一號至一百二十一元、碎米至九—五元、敏黨至一百二十五九、暹邏二號至一百十九元、　米一百—八元、英藥司一號西貢一百四十五元半至一百四十四元半、小紋一百四十一元至一百四十元、碎米一百零七元至一百零六元、但巿價漲後、實銷轉寂、國際風雲亦無尊外發展、大戶客囤亦須守待節後問津、浮戶散多趁高售出、故市面即轉疲風、結果收盤行情、一號西貢為一百二十四元、二號一百十九元敏黨一百二十三元、一百二十元、小絞一百十八元半、一百十八元、東京砶尖一百十一元、至一百零九元半、特別一百十四元、碎尖九十三四元統計先緊後疲、較之前巿、猶漲一二元左右、全日現米成交一萬三四千包、英華司原包的有千外噸、</p>
<p>工部局公賣米又有到滬、怡和洋行定生輪、由香港運來一萬包、昨午抵埠、停靠羅期福碼頭起卸、法公司郵船B．DE．S．Pierre號、由西貢直接運來大批洋米、昨晨到滬、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、確數俟今日探明後精報、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、昨日來源因趕節、抵埠者頗夥、且若輩搬運者資力有限、亟須晚手、遂不顧洋米緊俏、而售意殊鬆、故雖銷塲頗爽、市面無甚變化、且尙略帶軟、計開崑山鮮粳一百三十二三元、中關一百三十兀、南港早晚稻鮮特一百三十四元、普通一百三十一元半、中關一百三十元、原包木開、</p>
<p>糯米因見洋米回昂、人心並佳、去路不獨作舖轉旺、即飯擔零星胃口均聲、所以售全扳售之下、市價一致提升二三元、開香港團粒一百十五六元、畏粒一百十三四元、决至一百十一元、糯菉一百零五元决至一百零一元、國糯一百十五六元、</p>
<p>今日為夏屬端節、各該同業從事結賬、照例休業一天無市、</p>
<h3>麫粉漸漸向上</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、父見轉好、蓋以端陽　邊、投機買賣並無盡興、而本街　銷、尙不寂寞、良以連日米價逐漸回好、人心隨之向榮、執貨者動輒扳持、一時頹唐之氣、又見消散、金龍粉開盤二十九元九角及二十九元八角半、一度提高六七角、後市略鬆祗開一十九元七角、砲台粉三十元〇五角至三十元〇三角、成交的有一萬包强、惟目下存到兩充、市面脚地尙難鞏固、仍不脫浮盪小定之態、小麥無巿、今日端陽節停巿一天、</p>
<h3>雜項　黃豆與苞米　—行情有半元上落—</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市面、依然平庸、惟一日間市風尙屬熱烈、但實銷太弱、環境刺激不够引起投機者之新興奮、故各種巿價尙無巨大變遷、昨黃豆市因辦胃寥寥、（膠州豆三百包、歸德豆元百包）、行情跌去半元左右、苞米本街內地問津、市略升三五角、成交千譜包、豆餅近期棧單尙有收吸胃口、故上半天踢皮球生意頗緊湊、行情曾抬高五六角、下半日賣氣轉重、皮球被迫下降、結果較上日巿祗在一二角之間上落、共計做開期現各餅四萬四五千片云、</p>
<p>又有豆子二百五十五包、及豆餅一千二百叫十塊、今（三十日）俱運新加坡、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯補空套買　一時並作</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况滙豐尚牌、各滙未更、英美匯隨巿轉趨軟化、乃華商投機家空頭已着十補進與套買、更　港電來收吸、外商銀行乘機扳價、於午刻忽有朴多空氣、美滙一度軟至五元二七五、英金三辦士三一二五、旋悉前傳不確、美金獨稍回硬，下午日商銀行少扒、投機家觀望、銀行賣意稍佳，市勢穩定、直至收市、兩匯均軋緊〇三一二五、交易不稀、</p>

<p>後市謠風已息</p>
<p>下午雖日行三井吸進六月美金五元四〇六二五、因外商銀行尙有供給、投機家觀望、局勢穩定、現貨至六月期美金三辦士三一二五、美金五元四〇六二五、比上日收價、英滙均軋緊〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港美匯微緊</p>

<p>天津匯市平定</p>
<p>天津二十九日（週四）電、今晨滙巿開盤呆滯、倫敦及紐的電滙仍無上落、申匯降五角、為九十二元、「聯鈔」暗鰲亦賤五角、為五十九元、</p>
<h3>金市昂漲　現貨已見回降</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤　緊、續漲多盤、起伏於六千四百元十關左右、乃承上日昂勢、外匯再緊、各方人心於恍忽中緊堅、自晨開市即升至六千四百元關、機續向上、金號及匯票商套賣、數度回退至六千四百元內、會見六千三百九十二元距至午刻、忽來不根之誤、證券幫錢莊及散戶羣起事爭匯美滙又軟至五元三七五、價遂哄上至六千四百四十元、及悉前傳不確、浮多軋結、廣幫出籠、上漲頓見下挫、下午公和亦來猛出、又曾退至六千四百元內、終見金號及證券幫收吸、散戶有抬無撳、重見盤上、收市六千四百十元、續漲三十四元、全日交易五六萬兩、掉期（五月轉入六月）賣方貼出予買方曾喊低至五十五元、下午義元貼出予益大一百十兩、貼價六十元、最後回平、至七十元、現金巳見回降、誠達出寳成公記二十兩、價照期交高三百四十元、順源出祥和五十兩、高三百二十元、天元售予時和上下午各五十兩、均高三百十五元、比上日的低十元、飾金關金等均平、今日夏（端午）節、銀行休假、金匯兩市亦停假無市，</p>

<h3>金鎊漲後回平</h3>
<p>昨日外幣巿况、烚赤市價雖趨堅漲、然現貨獨見低落、故英美金鎊漲後回乎、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票一度高至一角二分、卒以十八元一角二分收盤、比上日　漲六分、香港票趨勢仍挺、日金票及朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、前者仍為一元九角七分、後者仍為一元六八角半、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交先施公司股五十股價為十元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、開盤續形穩定、價　迂緩上趨、成交額不大、橡皮股價、雖亦上升、興趣仍感缺乏、</p>

<h3>災區復興公債　十七决抽籤還本</h3>

<h3>紗花　連跳兩日之紗布　引起獲利出籠　雙馬最高一四六〇元　粗細紗港幫去路突旺</h3>
<p>上日大漲之紗巿、昨則始昂繼平、但趨勢尙堅、不過二日在跳、的有百元之數、一般盈利之戶、當然吐出、而再撈進、如期一來、市盤一日間有三决之變化、但現紗生意較昔大為起色、港幫買去粗細紗的有二千包左右、二十支　單五百十包，其餘二三支余鷄·大發二十支余城牧羊及十支粗紗共計一千五百包、於是多方人心愈振、據巿塲言、外客方面、巳有出籠一批、等待價格回鬆些、再當拖進、底盤即可扯輕、內慕究屬如何、局外人當然不得而知也、二十支雙馬高價一千四百六十元、低價一千四百三十八元、午後以今日端節將停巿、暗盤交易殊鮮、初做一千四百三十八元、同好至一千四白四十元、最後價為一千四百三十九元、目前紗巿、仍在流動不定中、今日有棉紗一千五百四十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨　盤、氣勢和平、首盤價為一千四百五十元、此時塲上情形、平澹之局、浮戶賣出較衆、即鬆至一千四百四十四元、但某方多頭復來收進、徐徐回上、同時標金開盤趨升、人心驟昂、直漲至一千四百六十元、中途盈利者了結、挫回至一千四百五十一元、在此五十二元周旋甚久、繼聞廣幫採辦甚殷、的有二千包交易、買氣復濃、重昂至一千四百六十元、繼後傳言外客多頭稍有吐出、又鬆至一千四百四十四·五元、時達十二時正、叉到一千四百五十五元、豈料十二點一刻、忽然下落至一千四百三十八元半收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬一千九百十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港一、九一〇同行一〇、〇〇〇統計二、九〇〇</p>
<h3>棉市良好</h3>
<p>現棉情况、稍形良好、此因現紗銷路活潑、廠方以熟貨出路旺盛、對於原料將有吸淮補償、所以粗細棉花頗有發展希望、惟昨巿緣端節在邇、號家咸乏興趣、實際成交非常冷靜、僅米得林做開一百件、棧交價四百二十元、</p>
<p>另訊滬　洋行外棉交易、略因紗市平穩而熱鬧、連日除同業不斷成交小額巴西棉外、廠方如保豐亦購米特林共三百包、目售價均在三百五十元左右、因之棉巿或有轉機之希望也、</p>
<p>紐的棉巾、先因氣候不利農業而漲、但續後又因多頭了結、華盛頓政治消息、斯密斯議案利於空頭而跌、結果，盤價格、較較上日漲跌三二磅音不等、印棉續停、預測今日開盤市况、較昨日看高二至八羅比、</p>

<h3>粽子</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>訪一個朋友，剛推進房門，火腿粽子味兒就直透七竅！</p>
<p>『哈……巧極巧極，快乘熱吃。』</p>
<p>話不講倒不害事，吃要緊。</p>
<p>在這一刻工夫，似乎人生就是粽子，萬念俱消，唯吃是從。我本想問問託他的事情；可是給狼吞虎嚥的「吃相」嚇住了，沒敢響。</p>
<p>咀嚼停止，咂咂嘴，然後那麼有點好萊塢「派頭」地聳一聳肩。『今天有空？』</p>
<p>其實道句話問了也等於不問，他明知道我一天到晚閑着。</p>
<p>『是啊！』我舌頭禁不住朝外一舐，火腿味的確三月不知了，旣香日酥。</p>
<p>『一年容易又端午，媽的，日子跑得緊！』他臨時「編」了句「詩」，看上去不勝感慨系之！</p>
<p>我可實在搬小出話，連腦角落裏都我遍了。半嚮，才榨出一句四面不靠邊吊在半空中的無聊話：『近米作何消遺？」</p>
<p>『多著多著，』他開始屈指計算，『補習學校吃吃豆腐，電影院裹搭搭壳子，跳舞塲蹓蹓，咖啡館坐坐；再不然公園裏跟在女人背後吹吹口哨兒……』接着「噓」地一聲，粽子氣撲鼻欲涎。</p>
<p>『老兄雅興倒很濃。』我有時候也「俏皮」，這一點自巳常常引以為「了不起」。</p>
<p>大約大家都身出禮義之鄉，我們彼此很客氣地「應酬」了半個點鐘，我才「打開天窗」來。於是，覺得自己臉上皮笑肉不笑地笑了一笑。：『拜託的事情有無頭緒？』</p>
<p>『喔——』他從五車霧中直跌下來，眼睛巴眨巴眨，『這個……我還正在想法子。』</p>
<p>好險！總算沒有回絕，他「還正在」想法子。</p>
<p>出得門來，我「彷彿」記起去年吃粽子的時候也從他家裏拿了「還正在」的回音打回老家去！</p>
<p>一年復一年，粽子倒年年有了吃處。</p>
<h3>定米</h3>
<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>我們的主任跨進了辦公室。他一進門，就是：</p>
<p>『報吿各位一個好消息，工部局所定的「港米」，我們也可以定，每担一百十元，每包作一担兩斗半算，計國幣一百三十七元半，每人最多定二包，每包先交定洋七十元，不過要退袋！」</p>
<p>停了一停，他又提高了啜子——</p>
<p>『各位要的話，今天就要決定，讓我夫接治。』</p>
<p>於是同人們中間就不寗靜起來，因為這是有關「民食」的大事，大家都感到一陣舒暢，像患着氣喘病，覺得平服了一點似的。</p>
<p>但當時，大家却決定不下來，因為都得回家去商量一下，到底要多少包。</p>
<p>下午，辦公室裏又熱鬧起來，大家出都議論紛紛，不過有的人家裏有米，願意放棄權利，於是大家接洽，『你名下的讓給我好哦？』</p>
<p>『太爺，我定四包！」</p>
<p>『邵先生，我定二包！』</p>
<p>不多時，已經有三十包米了。</p>
<p>第二天，邵主任太爺又來報吿消息了，說這米不能直接到「洋行」裹去拿，或是要他們送。而是一定要由一家指定的「米店」裏去承辦。由我們的同事（注意是同事）之一所開的米店去辦理這項工作。</p>
<p>當然，我們大家沒有反對的，反正　要拿米就是了！好在每家米店不都是屬於「蛀虫之流」的！</p>
<p>隔了一天，更「具體的辦法」又來了，說是××米號為了手續麻煩，為了「不能告人的損失」，不得巳而定出了這樣的辦法：</p>
<p>（一）每包以實足重量計算，暫時先收一担二的價錢，因為來貨的包頭有大小，　得吃虧便宜。</p>
<p>（二）要袋的先收壓袋錢國幣五元正。</p>
<p>（三）每包加送力國幣」元正</p>
<p>但同入間却頓時像浪潮似的。理由是——</p>
<p>『大家都是同事，而且外面也同樣可以買得到，我們何苦一定要去麻煩朋友呢？我們退了吧，省得費事』</p>
<p>一下子，就退走了十六包！</p>
<p>倒驟的第一號就是我——忙着開支票——因為收錢的時候是現款，但都繳到銀行裏去了，要退款，就只好開支票了</p>
<p>這樣，我們總算是定過米了，而且也煩勞過回事，但××米　的五六十塊大洋的「準　　　　不能打個折扣了！</p>

<h3>「抓一抓」</h3>
<p>— 淇水</p>
<p>一天了，肚裏還沒有放下一點點。</p>
<p>啊，肚子不答應了，飢，飢的哭起來，我忙束束褲帶，喊道：「乖乖的，再熬一下吧，再一刻，只要再一刻，「便宜米』就好吃了！」於是我方始仍得拖起兩條柴骨的腿走。</p>
<p>路旣遠，燃料叉沒有加—幾元錢。加侖的汽油，人家燒了去玩，自己却連大餅油條也加不起。坐車吧，袋底也翻了，我不出什麼。</p>
<p>「先生，幫幫忙！抓一抓！」突然，一個女子氣喘的聲音，我急抬起頭，那個女子正灘了兩手，擺着欲跑叉不跑的姿勢。急再向後一望，一個……就叫他癟三吧，捧了個紙袋已跑得很遠，女子嘆口氣，長長的。</p>
<p>「幫幫忙，抓一抓！」六個字，無異六把刺刀，刺破我每個細胞？</p>
<p>我的肚子又飢飢的哭起來了，這回却哭得更厲害。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鳥</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「你又不是玉華，難道也怕袁寳藩那個混賬東西嗎？」</p>
<p>「忘八蛋才怕他！」玉崑差一些從床上直跳起來。「不過你旣然說起劉老大，我倒先要問間他近來怎麼樣啦？你們兩個筆下都來得，大　總有消息吧！」</p>
<p>提到劉玉華，秋海棠的心上不覺又擁起了一障不快。</p>
<p>「他一直在上海搭班，只是南方人都愛看本戲，老大一時還冒不起來。去年李玉芳從上海向來，吿訴我他的景况很不好，大烟倒巳抽上了：我便馬上給　滙了二百塊錢去，另外寫了一封長信，竭力勸他把烟戒掉，有機會馬上回北方來，祇要跟我。起出台，那怕不紅。豈知這信去了許久，始終不見他有回信給我，想必我那幾句勸他戒烟的話，說得太激切了些，反惹他生氣了……。」秋海棠接連着說了這一長篇話，才覺得氣力有些不濟起來，可是從大體上講，他今天的情形的確巳比昨天好多了。</p>
<p>「本來你是多餘的！他們唱譚派鬚生的怎麼能不抽烟？不抽烟還成個譚派鬚生嗎？」玉崑忍不住這樣信口取笑着。</p>
<p>秋海粱也知道他仔心要逗開自巳的心思，別再為了玉華添上一重愁悶，便立即又把話鋒移到正文上來。</p>
<p>「閒話少說，老二，你究竟肯去不肯去？」</p>
<p>「不去諒你也放我不過。」玉昆的手又在衣袋裹摸弄着他那一支僅餘的捲烟，可是這决並沒有掏出來。「反正像這樣降妖捉怪的勾當，也還算得是我的本工戲，不怕趙四榮奎這一班東西飛上了天去！」</p>
<p>然而事實却不然，待他在第二天趕到北京，畢竟因為日子巳過了好幾天，榮奎金大個子和秋海棠家裏　外幾個興妖作怪的下人，巳經都逃得不知去向了，只剩一個並沒有出過什麼花樣的趙四，還在那裹坐守潸。（一一九）</p>
<h3>上海居民的營養問題</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>上海自從成了「孤島」以後，在統制，囤積，操縱的各種複雜原因下，各種物價的飛漲，無疑是自所幾白萬居民的一個極度嚴重的生活威脅。一般人因為遭受物價嚴重的影響，生活是更感到困難了。當和居民的營養問題，正在此地嚴重地醞釀着。</p>
<p>不論在那一個角落裏，允其是比較此層的窮困地方，總可以看到許多因為營養不足而有各種病態的人們；這種情形顯然對一個社會是極端不利的。</p>
<p>據工部局調查報吿，最近食物價格由於運滬物品所受統制的擴大，以致來貨稀少。魚類等水產物之供給亦因海岸被封鎖而銳减。此外更因囤積操縱壟斷居奇，促成目關非常高漲的物價。根據該局的統計，除了食米不必再談外，豆腐在一九三六年（即滬戰以前）每方價是〇。〇〇七二元，但是現在却增漲到五倍。靑菜本來每斤只〇·〇三五元，目前巳貴到一倍。蘿蔔，洋山芋，韮菜，豆芽……等向來被人視為最普遍最基本的食料，現在都漲了五倍以上。鮮猪肉在一九三六年每斤價僅〇·二九二元，現在亦已需一·一二〇元了，鮮魚原只〇·一六三元一斤單位，最近巳漲了七倍。其他鷄卵，猪油，水果等各種富含營養的食品，現在已受高價影響而大量地减少了一般人的吸收量了。</p>
<p>不久以前，當局發起了國民營養研究會，對於一般食物如五穀，豆類，蔬菜，肉類，糖，及猪油雜物等營義原素的分配數量和價値，會經召集專家加以研究，以期合乎科學化及戰時的需求。</p>
<p>上海居民營養問題的嚴里性，顯然超過一般的地方，補救的追切正是是每一個人所關切着。</p>
<p>中央衛生署最近在全國衛生會議席上，對個人營養問題，曾加週密檢討。並且依據科學方法，訂了補救一般營養缺乏標準七項；這些也可以供上海居民的參考，現在特貢獻給上海居民參考：（一）多用豆類及雜糧，以米蛋白質之過於單純（錏基酸不完備）有害營養。（二）竭力鼓勵養鷄義魚及牛羊畜牧事業，使人人能享受肉類食物，改善吾人動物蛋質的缺乏。（三）提倡糙米黑麵，改良蒸飯方　及傾棄米湯等不良習慣，以免維生素礦質之廢棄。（四）多食蔬菜水果，若太菜以能殺菌及寄生蟲為度。不應過久，致維生素减少或滅絕。（五）多利用日光，以補助維丁素丁之不足。（六）在經濟可能範園內，酌加油類脂肪調劑食物，俾可以增淮食物。</p>
<p>目前上海醞釀着的民衆營養問題的嚴重，已是無可否認的事；我希望這能引起大家的注意。當然我們不能忽略此時此地的實在悄形，徒然「說食數寳」，不免為人所笑，但在可能範圍內這正不是多餘的提議。</p>

<h3>跑冰表演花絮錄　千變萬化…猶如天馬飛行　粉墨登場…居然台步唱詞</h3>
<p>— 茜蒂</p>
<p>昨日永安跑冰場為紀念三周紀念，特舉行盛大的技術表演和化裝平劇。這也可以說是一種刺激的新鮮新聞，在上海地方，還是創見。下午三點三十分，跑冰塲的四周，已擠得水洩不通，許多男男女女的跑冰迷的視綫，都集中在空塲上。不一會，無綫電報吿：「技術表演開始！」於是十二個穿着黃襯衫黑長褲的跑冰隊的隊員，排着一字長蛇陣出塲了，領隊的是十餘年前的冰壇宿將沈維後，觀衆都報以熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>表演開始了！</p>
<p>全塲是靜靜的，大家屛息而觀，第一個節目是「三周紀念」，全體隊員繞塲跑了三個圈子。接下去有：「梅花椿」，「金鷄倒掛」，「南極戲鶴」，「蓮花旋轉」，「百步穿楊」，「天平秤」，「轟炸機」，「車輪大轉」，「龍門陣」。在這些表演中，耍以繆懷秋的「百步穿楊」和沈維德領導的「轟炸機」最為精彩了。「百步穿楊」是先有三個人脚劃八字步，然後繆君以一字矮步由彼等袴下穿過，之後，人數逐漸增加，直至穿過十二人，觀衆便高聲喊道：「好身手！」「轟炸機」除了跑冰鞋踏出「轟轟」之聲外，在飛機頭上，還有一面我們大中華民國的國旗，當國旗在塲中飛揚時，觀衆都自動地拍起手來，這是表顯了每個人內心對於國家敬愛的熱忱。</p>
<p>所謂「化裝平劇」，就是由跑冰隊隊員穿了跑冰鞋，扮花旦，起小生，居然粉墨登塲，而且也有鑼鼓，也有胡琴，這較之於「黃金」，「卡爾登」諸名角的演戲，又是一種風味。</p>
<p>「化裝平劇」是在晚上七點鐘開始的。他們這一决演的是「戰地鴛鴦」，由跑冰塲敎練丁金福起旗牌，趙國傑起王伯儻，繆懷秋起東方氏。出塲是四個隊員扮搖旗吶喊之流，以各種不同姿勢與觀衆見面，上海人大概還第一决看到穿戲裝的，可以不着靴子，而以跑冰鞋代替。這不能算是稀奇，好戲尙在後面哩！</p>
<p>旗牌出來的時候，手裹捧了牌位，那副鬼頭鬼臉的樣子，引得全塲人都哈哈大笑了，而目脚步中一顚一聳，顯出其功夫之不凡。</p>
<p>沈維德手捧大刀，以燕步出塲，脚平手直，姿勢美妙，眞不愧是冰壇宿將。</p>
<p>繆懷秋的東方氏，以扭扭之態出塲，手中耍槍，嬌健飄逸，猶如柔龍脫兎，天馬飛行。接着趙國傑的王伯儻也出塲了，台步很穩，要槍的姿態，雖比不上京角兒，然而也相當有功夫。</p>
<p>關於唱的一方面，因為我是外行，所以不大喜歡聽，只是看着弄槍的花樣，倒也頗感興趣，槍來槍去，槍去槍來，一會兒跌，一會兒起，這邊一讓，那邊一推，千變萬化，式樣繁多。我眞懷疑脚上穿了跑冰鞋，怎麼會有如此大的本領呢？</p>
<p>看完表演，我心裏在想：「跑冰這玩童兒，旣是運動，也是娛樂，牠給予人們的身體的健康，精神的調劑，都是有着極大的裨益的。」</p>

<h3>US President Issues Statement: No Intention to Amend Neutrality Act, Emergency Powers to be Implemented Gradually, Naval Actions May Extend to the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt, while claiming yesterday that he did not intend to request the repeal of the Neutrality Act, avoided discussing whether he would ask Congress to amend it. The President told reporters in Washington that such questions were too delicate to answer. The President also stated that the policies he intended to implement did not conflict with the Neutrality Act's restrictions on American ships entering combat zones. The President would not depart from the fundamental principle. He said that maintaining freedom of the seas also allowed for the prohibition of ships from entering specific ports. The President insisted that, in the history of the current Neutrality Act, Congress indeed wished to retain complete rights over maritime freedom as a traditional American policy, even though it had designated certain combat zones and prohibited American ships from entering them. Regarding the invocation of priority for steel production, the President cited revised government reports indicating that, as a result of increased demand due to the Lend-Lease Act and expanded national defense programs, the steel shortage in 1941 was 1.4 million tons, whereas initial estimates had indicated a surplus of 10 million tons. In 1942, the shortage would reach 6.4 million tons, compared to initial estimates of a surplus of 2 million tons. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he would implement powers in a gradual manner to fulfill the order issued Tuesday night placing the nation in a state of full emergency. He stated that these actions would be implemented from time to time in the form of announcements or executive orders. The President told reporters that he had no intention of requesting Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, which would prevent the US from transporting raw materials into war zones. Roosevelt also mentioned that priority would be given to steel production because steel production facilities were quite inadequate. Furthermore, he noted that if mediation of labor disputes failed, the government might take further direct action. Well-informed circles yesterday interpreted the President's assurance to Britain as a signal that American naval operations would extend to the Atlantic, or that the "special task force" established to deal with the Axis threat might be deployed. It was also stated that "this American fleet" might consist of battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. They predicted that the fleet's operations at sea would be similar to the British fleet's pursuit of the "Graf Spee." Some sources claimed that the right to open fire first would be given to the Axis powers. If the Axis powers were unwilling to fight a superior fleet, the United States could deliver goods to Britain without a fight. However, they believed that if Axis warships opened fire, the United States would have to retaliate and could transport goods to Britain. Millions of Americans, from New York to Manila, from St. John's Island to Alaska, were vying to seek from the President's eloquent speech what special steps the government would take. The President's speech and the announcement of full emergency powers have heightened national attention to the threat facing the Western Hemisphere. In addition to informing the world that the United States was determined to assist China and Britain at any cost, President Roosevelt stated that the imminent material crisis must be addressed by the nation's utmost strength in national defense production. He said that this must be done at any cost, whether for private individuals or capitalists, for labor or managers. Therefore, the country has now made the following clear policy decisions: (1) Assist China and Britain with raw materials in any way possible; (2) Maintain freedom of the seas; (3) Defend the two hemispheres from all aggression and threats of aggression; (4) Support this policy with force if necessary. The United States must now choose between supporting this policy, even to the point of engaging in war with the Axis powers, or allowing the government's credibility to collapse under the pressure of public opinion. Observers believe that the government will choose the former. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, told reporters yesterday morning that the President would have a special meeting with reporters in the afternoon. When reporters told him that the President's remarks had caused some confusion regarding the convoy issue, O'Leary replied that he thought the President would clarify it in the afternoon, but he thought the President had already clarified it. A reporter also asked if the President's call for the nation to prioritize national defense should be interpreted as the end of the debate period. O'Leary replied that free speech would indeed continue. He also said that the President's remarks represented 80% of the matter, with 20% left to be announced later. O'Leary also stated that, according to a survey by Columbia Broadcasting System, the number of people who listened to the President's speech exceeded any previous record. It was estimated that there were 65.65 million listeners in the United States, 20 million in Canada, and many listeners in South America and Britain. The White House received an endless stream of telegrams and phone calls, breaking previous records, the number of which was impossible to count. Secretary of State Hull told people that the reaction to the President's speech was very positive, as was the reaction from diplomats in Latin American countries. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt met with British Ambassador Halifax and renowned British economist Keynes for two and a half hours on Wednesday. It was heard that the discussions involved American defense production and the general economic situation. Halifax claimed that the issue of taking further steps to escort convoys to Britain was not discussed, as it was a matter for the US President himself. The President informed them how war material production was progressing, which he considered to be extraordinary. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<h3>Germany Reissues Warning to the United States</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German government yesterday "mocked and refuted" President Roosevelt's speech and reissued a warning stating that the "total blockade" of Britain still existed and that any American ships attempting to break through it would be sunk. Reliable sources said, "Germany has no quarrel with the United States, but Germany is prepared to deal with new enemies. Roosevelt's reiterated freedom of the seas was dismissed as one-sided. Roosevelt was also accused of trying to create a "panic situation" and attempting to speak unilaterally on behalf of the Americas. It was also stated that the declaration of a state of emergency would be "the end of American liberalism." (International News Service, 29th)</p>
<h3>American Flying Fortress to Face Extraordinary Threats, Resolve Human Demons, Indeed Physical and Mental Freedom</h3>
<h3>Reactions of US Senators and Representatives to the President's Speech</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday led the United States to the brink of an undeclared war, and he was prepared to fulfill his declaration of unlimited emergency powers. In his eloquent fireside chat, he emphasized that labor strikes and various obstacles must be stopped immediately. He expanded the scope of the aid-to-Britain program and used force to protect the transportation of military supplies to support his declaration. President Roosevelt's assurances exceeded the scope of escorting convoys. His speech elicited different reactions across the country, with some in favor and others in opposition. People across the country, from government leaders to ordinary people on the street, had different views. Minnesota Republican Representative Maas said, "This is what we call war." Texas Democratic Senator Connally called the President's speech a "bugle call to enlist all Americans to do their duty." Ohio Republican Senator Taft said, "The declaration of an unlimited national emergency has no legal effect. The President has no authority to declare such a state of emergency and revoke constitutional rights. Virginia's people considered the President's speech an ultimatum, which was not an exaggeration." Another famous commentator from the Howard newspaper chain, Kreckel, said, "Our America has changed overnight." Thus, after a small wait, President Roosevelt has acquired new powers. The Presidential Palace has been placed in a position to start an undeclared war, or even to wage an undeclared war against the Axis when he deems it necessary. This speech and announcement are no different from the government announcing that a state of war has been established. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<h3>All Parties in the United States Give High Praise, While Republicans Criticize It</h3>
<p>Washington – Congressional criticisms of President Roosevelt's remarks were mixed. Democrats and those in favor of aiding democracies praised it, while Republicans criticized it. The Republican candidate for president in 1936, Landon, who has always advocated non-interventionism, claimed that the democratic system in the United States has now come to an end, at least temporarily. Most Washington newspapers gave it high praise. The Washington Post stated that Hitler is no longer just the enemy of our friends, but also our enemy. New York Times Democrat Senator Glass agreed with every word and sentence in the speech. Georgia Democratic Senator George, who is also Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the speech was a very powerful statement of the government's basic policy. The leader of the isolationists, New York Republican Representative Fish, called it "an excuse for interventionists." North Dakota Republican Senator Nye said, "The President is telling us that we are already escorting convoys." Nevada Democratic Senator McCarran said, "This speech is just another way of declaring war." New York Democratic Senator Wagner said, "The American people, in the face of an unprecedented global crisis, have placed an unparalleled responsibility on President Roosevelt's shoulders. The President has only resolutely accepted it and bravely implemented it." (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – A well-known commentator from the "Scripps-Howard" newspaper chain, Simms, wrote yesterday, "Diplomatic envoys here warn their governments that the United States is now only waiting for the Axis powers to take an 'excessive action' to join the war." Simms said, "This is their interpretation of President Roosevelt's speech and announcement." He also said, "Diplomats believe that the President's move to inform congressional leaders of everything in advance (before the speech) is the closest the President can get to declaring war within the possible scope. Envoys here interpret American policy as similar to an ultimatum. In fact, we are reporting to Rome that the President's decision will have a far-reaching impact on Italy. Italians who heard the speech yesterday morning were shaken by it. It is heard that newspapers and wireless telegraph operators are saying that the United States is not only moving towards war, but also deploying armed forces in key locations to prepare. This is alarming. Italy is awaiting this speech with great concern, not only government officials, but also the public. Therefore, a large number of people listened to the speech in the morning. Generally speaking, this decision will be a blow to Italy. Any Italian should know its importance." Positive reviews continue to come from all over the United States, showing that the people are deeply moved by the speech. The New York Post wrote in large letters, "The President has declared that the Navy will guarantee Dakar, the Azores, and Fortaleza at any time." New York Governor Lehman said that those who fight for their own freedom and the freedom of others will definitely have stronger beliefs and more courage after hearing the President's words. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>New York – The largest labor union in the United States, the "American Federation of Labor," has responded to President Roosevelt's speech and asked all unions to join the federation and to do their best to mediate any disputes in national defense industries, and not to lightly announce strikes unless all efforts have been exhausted. Willkie also gave a speech today, urging American workers, "We cannot be satisfied with just building one plane when the Nazis build one plane, or building one tank when the Nazis build one tank. We must overwhelm the Nazi armories." (Reuter, 29th)</p>

<p>Editorial: The Reaction to President Roosevelt's Speech</p>
<p>After President Roosevelt's historically significant speech two days ago was broadcast, it quickly spread to every corner of the world, causing a variety of different fluctuations and reactions. Briefly speaking, among democratic countries and their people, there was generally a sense of comfort and satisfaction, while occasionally expressing slight regret that Roosevelt did not clearly declare the specific steps to be taken thereafter. In aggressive countries, for the most part, the threatening words of Liddell continued to be heard, but they could not completely conceal their inner fear. Based on this, it can be seen that the attitude declared by the US authorities, even though it aroused the hostility of aggressors, still felt insufficient for those who earnestly hoped that the United States would clearly express its future plans. Regarding this situation, there is a need to further analyze and explain it.</p>
<p>Careful analysis of the various developments in the United States shows that it has long held a firm position on the current situation. In essence, that is to defeat the aggressors and assist democratic countries in achieving victory in the war. This fundamental aspiration of Roosevelt's was declared repeatedly even before the outbreak of the European war. As for its actual implementation, it must adapt to the development of the international situation externally, and adapt to the strength and public opinion of its own country internally. Therefore, it may not always be able to completely satisfy the requirements of some people. If the United States had been able to provide thousands of aircraft to France when France was defeated last summer and Reynaud appealed to the United States, it might have been possible to save the tragedy of Compiègne. The effect would naturally not be comparable to the current support for the British army in the bitter fight, but that was not allowed by the public opinion and national defense production capacity of the United States at that time. From this, we can understand that the US authorities have their own unavailing difficulties, and criticism is only futile. During this year, the United States has made a leap in its political tradition from deciding to do its best to assist democratic countries in the war to declaring the existence of a national emergency, which cannot be considered very fast compared to the various developments in the international situation. However, it has made the greatest effort and loyalty in overcoming internal and external obstacles. Even in Roosevelt's speech the day before yesterday, he not only rebuked the peace fallacies of the isolationists, but also warned the US agencies mediating industrial disputes to do their work early, showing that even when the brink of war has been reached, there are still some internal problems to consider. However, it can be asserted that these problems will not have any strong obstruction or restraint when the critical moment for major decisions arrives. As the United States is speaking in the status of a non-belligerent country, its measures to support democratic countries have reached the maximum extent, and the next step is only to participate in the war. At this moment, the US authorities clearly do not want to put the act of participating in the war ahead of various effective measures, although the existence of the state of emergency has already indicated that the United States is on the eve of war. If aggressive countries must push the United States from the edge of war into the vortex of war, the United States will not only not hesitate, but is also prepared. Although it is already engaged in a disguised war in practice, it is not willing to take on the appearance of war itself in form. This is probably the fundamental belief of the US authorities at this moment. As for how to deliver aid to Britain, whether to adopt convoying or use the recently established "special task force" for reconnaissance, that is a matter for the US State Department to carefully consider, and the method may not be immutable. Since the unlimited state of emergency already exists, President Roosevelt has obtained all kinds of powers except for participating in the war, and it can be imagined that he must have thoroughly planned the future development and steps. Even though he did not make specific declarations in his speech, he can fully exercise his own powers on this point.</p>
<p>It is natural that the firm attitude of the US authorities aroused strong agitation on the Axis side, but it remains questionable to what extent its ability can fulfill Liddell's threats and rhetoric. The sinking of the Bismarck proved that British maritime authority should not be taken lightly, and Germany's attempt to seize dominance of the Atlantic was only a frustrated illusion. Of course, Hitler is unwilling to sit idly by and watch aid to Britain arrive, but its naval strength cannot achieve the effect of completely obstructing it. The goal is difficult to achieve, and instead only leads to the consequence of establishing another belligerent enemy. If the Nazi authorities do not want to act too emotionally, they cannot avoid making major considerations. During the last war, the Imperial German authorities made many efforts to mitigate American participation in the war due to maritime disputes. The Nazi authorities may not be less clever than the Imperial German era. On the other hand, this is naturally the time for the Tripartite Pact, and Liddell's remarks the other day happened to be made to reporters of the Allied News Agency, which was probably not accidental. The tone in Tokyo has been quite fluctuating in recent days, and the long-silent rhetoric has been repeatedly discovered, which can be expected to be the result of a tacit understanding between Germany and Japan in order to deal with the United States. The American President, in his speech, praised China's war effort and promised to give China additional assistance, which was undoubtedly also aimed at the application of the Tripartite Pact. Recently, after the failure of the moderate policy towards China, Britain, and the United States by the Matsuoka faction, the hard-line anti-China and anti-US arguments of the military faction have prevailed again. However, even the large-scale military offensive against China that was launched recently has been trapped in a dilemma, and there is very little realistic significance in extravagantly talking about war with the United States. The sinking of the Bismarck proved that a good tradition is more decisive than the strength of a warship itself. Regardless of whether the tough stance of the aggressive countries is enough to scare the United States, even if it moves from stance to practice, the sum of the forces of democratic countries today to deal with the joint offensive of the allied countries, the number of successes and failures, is not a difficult problem to determine.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Failure to Mention Japan is of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Washington – According to responsible members of Congress who met with President Roosevelt a few hours before he delivered his radio address two days ago, government officials are increasingly confident that Japan's participation in the Axis powers will soon decline. They cited President Roosevelt's failure to mention the Pacific issue in his radio address as evidence. Their belief is based on news from Tokyo that [a force] now gaining ground is gradually influencing the military clique. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his opinion that President Roosevelt's failure to discuss the Pacific issue is of great significance, and he expects that the situation in the Far East will change slightly. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<h3>Willkie Fully Supports the Policies Announced by the President</h3>
<p>New York – Republican leader Willkie last night gave his full support to President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Tuesday night. Willkie prepared a statement saying, "The President has said what we need to hear in excellent language. The President is very clear and correct in his recognition of the economic, social, political, and military impact on the United States after the Nazis defeat Britain. The President has also announced facts that have not been made public before to show that the situation in Britain is serious. Our foreign policy has been announced. Now, whether we are Republicans, Democrats, or New Dealers, we should unite to</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Enthusiastically Praise Roosevelt's Fireside Chat</h3>
<p>Chongqing – This morning, all newspapers published Roosevelt's speech as the top news item and enthusiastically praised it in their commentaries. The Central Daily News said, "The American head of state has made a final decision, and the United States' defense of freedom has also reached a final juncture. Before the publication of this speech, the United States was only an arsenal of democratic countries. After the publication, we believe that the United States has entered a period of full action. If the United States is not conquered, the resistance of China and Britain will not fail. In other words, we firmly believe that China and Britain have obtained a guarantee of victory." It also said, "Roosevelt is one of the greatest politicians in ancient and modern times, and his assumption of the head of state of the United States is both the fortune of the American people and the fortune of all democratic countries in the world." Ta Kung Pao said that after reading this great speech, it can be known that American neutrality has become a thing of the past and has turned to a wartime system, serving as the last bastion of democracy. However, the speech did not specifically mention Japan, which may be mistaken by Japan as an intentional avoidance.</p>
<h3>Italian Commentary on Roosevelt's Speech Remains His Usual Trickery</h3>
<p>Rome – Informed sources here last night commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that the manner in which the speech was published was somewhat similar to the American election campaign. (As far as Britain is concerned, it is inevitably disappointed with Roosevelt's speech, because the US did not participate in the war, but only declared a state of emergency. The reasons stated by Roosevelt are only for domestic people to listen to, which shows that the anti-war faction in the United States still has considerable efforts. The focus of Roosevelt's remarks is still the threat to the United States if the Axis powers win, and the threat of totalitarianism to Europe. On the contrary, democracy is not the case. Roosevelt claimed that the social reform of the United States has seen progress, but it is contradictory to ignore the progress of social reform in the Axis countries. Roosevelt admitted that the merchant ships lost by Britain exceeded those built by three times, and one time higher than those built by the United States and Britain. As for struggling for maritime freedom, the Axis countries are also fighting for this. In short, the speech is in accordance with Roosevelt's policy of making the Americans believe that the United States must participate in the war. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome – Gedda, the editor-in-chief of American News, commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that Roosevelt was selling his usual tricks. In return for Britain's cession of the Western Hemisphere territory, he only expressed his willingness to give Britain assistance, but did not make a specific indication. Roosevelt's decision was not based on Britain's needs, but on the interests of the United States. There are many contradictions in Roosevelt's speech, and the reason is that the interventionist faction in the United States wants to say that its goal is to carry out aggression in the name of defense. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Believes that This Speech Has Removed the Appearance of Neutrality</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Japan Times published an editorial criticizing the American President's speech, entitled "On the Edge of War," saying that the American President's speech had no trace of neutrality, but expressed a firm opposition to Hitler's position, and even made a promise to resist Germany's rights in British territorial waters. The United States has now abandoned the last appearance of neutrality, and the reason for this is not the public opinion expressed by the Neutrality Act, but the President's words and actions. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Kokumin Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun both criticized President Roosevelt for expressing his intention to provide more powerful assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. Hochi Shimbun wrote, "The United States is now daring to clearly reveal its hostility towards Japan. The United States should be wary of the position Japan now holds, which has been forced to take various effective measures to deal with hostile threats. Kokumin Shimbun said that the United States has shown that it is an enemy of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and Japan cannot stand idly by. Miyako Shimbun urged President Roosevelt to carefully consider the consequences of the United States assisting the Chiang government, which is currently trapped in Chongqing, for the result of this umbrella is only to make many trillions of people in China continue to suffer from the war, otherwise the United States must be responsible for disrupting peace in the Far East. The press heard that the political stench in President Roosevelt's speech was not worth worrying about, because his words were intended to threaten the Axis countries on the one hand, and to incite domestic enthusiasm for participating in the war on the other hand.

<h3>Britain Acknowledges the American Public Will Grant the President Discretionary Power</h3>
<p>London, Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent: A London spokesperson's comment yesterday that the American President had begun preparing for war summarized the general impression of the President's speech. The British public believes this speech will allow the American people to grant their leader discretionary power. Londoners noted the declaration of freedom of the seas, considering it not only crucial but also evidence of the American President's extraordinary political acumen. This is because the President, amid the public debate over transporting aid to Britain, resolved the dispute with a simple solution—the Lend-Lease Act. The President did not detail escort methods but announced a broad, fundamental policy of freedom of the seas, encompassing all matters related to escorting. Therefore, its importance is far greater than declaring escort details. Predictions within the United States that Axis nations will not welcome the President's speech are considered accurate here, as the speech not only practically guarantees aid to Britain but also analyzes.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson States Speech is Not Surprising</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry spokesperson commented last night on President Roosevelt's speech, calling it "unmoving." It only discussed the developments of the war and the status of belligerent nations, failing to mention concrete measures to aid Britain. Germany's position has been thoroughly explained by the Führer's speech in the Reichstag and Admiral Raeder's remarks to the Axis Allies. Roosevelt's assertion of maintaining freedom of the seas—that the United States has the right to transport munitions at will—completely ignores the freedom of civilians in belligerent nations to obtain provisions and the protection of neutral countries' trade. As for the recently claimed threat to North America by Germany, it is utter nonsense. Regarding the declaration of a state of emergency, this directly affects the American people, reducing some of their freedoms and increasing the President's power. We have no need to panic. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared today that the most important point of President Roosevelt's speech was the declaration of a national state of unlimited emergency. In other words, the U.S. government, to increase Britain's advantage in the war against Germany, will demand greater sacrifices from the American people. It was also stated that Roosevelt later told foreign reporters he had no intention of abolishing the Neutrality Act. Berlin has taken note of this statement but believes it does not seem to align with his speech. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Soong Tzu-wen Resigns as President of the National Defense League</h3>
<p>Washington: Soong Tzu-wen, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, announced yesterday that he has resigned from the position of President of the China Defense League. He has already reported the reasons for his resignation to Clark, the secretary of the association. (Editor's note: The China Defense League that Mr. Soong announced his resignation from has absolutely no connection with the China Defense Supplies Corporation based in the United States. The nature of this so-called China Defense League is not clearly understood here. However, according to reliable sources, the association's location is in Hong Kong, and its participants include not only people from various Chinese political parties but also many foreigners. Its nature is like a privately organized research group, aimed at promoting American aid to China in the form of military materials. (May 29th, United Press)</p>

<p>Fierce Battle Rages Between British and German Forces on Crete</p>
<p>British Troops Withdraw Voluntarily from Canea, Sea Still Controlled by British Fleet</p>
<p>Cairo: British overseas troops fought desperately in a do-or-die battle on Crete yesterday, trying to block the Nazis. Sources say fierce fighting on Crete is ongoing, especially between Canea and Maleme. New Zealand troops are engaging in hand-to-hand combat with German forces. British reinforcements have been shipped in by sea, while German forces have not used tanks. (May 29th, United Press)</p>
<p>London: According to the latest news from Crete, New Zealand, Australian, and British troops are now fighting shoulder to shoulder on Crete, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The fighting is intensifying daily. It is reported that German troops continue to pour into the main battle areas around Maleme and Canea. Yesterday, an official in Cairo said that Allied forces had been forced to retreat due to heavy attacks and intense aerial bombardment. Last night, a spokesman for the Cairo headquarters said that this battle was a desperate struggle. A New Zealand officer who had recently returned to Cairo from the island said that the battle was old-fashioned on land but completely new in the air. Dominion troops had to close in on the enemy for close combat. According to the latest reports, the two sides are fighting so closely that it is difficult to see the progress of the battle. There are isolated battles in Rethymno and Heraklion, but the main battle is taking place in the Canea area. British forces are defending a broad front there, constantly under attack from the enemy on land and in the air. The New Zealand officer left in Cairo said that when the German paratroopers first landed and attacked, they looked like lost sheep. London claimed today that Germany had used</p>
<p>London: A Cairo dispatch states that British Empire troops and German forces in Crete are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat west of Canea, using light machine guns, hand grenades, rifles, and bayonets. German claims that Canea has completely fallen have not been officially confirmed by London. However, several British correspondents in Cairo have telegraphed that British troops have voluntarily withdrawn from Canea. The British War Office says that this withdrawal is not surprising. It is believed that the fighting in the Canea area is among the fiercest seen in this decisive battle. Australian and New Zealand troops, who have been fighting hard for a long time and remain determined, still want to repel the German forces, who are constantly being reinforced with paratroopers and troops carried by planes, but are constantly subjected to bombing. A British spokesman in Cairo said, "This is a fierce, decisive battle." If the German forces occupy Canea, their next target will be the naval base at Suda Bay. However, it is believed that this place is not very useful to either side at present. The German air force is extremely dominant, so it would be too dangerous for the British to use Suda Bay. But even if Germany does occupy it, it will not be of great use, as the British navy still controls the sea and can still prevent any Axis convoys from approaching Crete. In any case, if the German forces want to effectively control Suda Harbor, they must also occupy the Akrotiri Peninsula, which is a broken land rising to 1,000 feet and extending to the south bank of Suda Bay, all the way to Cape Tríbuna. The German landing in Heraklion is also considered dangerous, as the German forces may be able to gather sufficient forces there to attack from the east, which would seriously threaten the British defenses in western Crete. After consolidating their position in Maleme, the German forces are no longer using paratroopers and gliders in that area. They are now only using troop transport planes. London estimates that the German forces are using 1,200 Junkers Ju 52 planes to transport German troops to Crete. At the height of the German attack, one plane was arriving every minute. (May 29th, United Press)</p>
<h3>German Mountain Troops Reach Suda Bay, Italian Troops Land on Crete</h3>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that German warships sank 52,000 tons of enemy merchant ships at sea yesterday, 41,000 tons of which were sunk by the same warship. The Bismarck shot down five British planes on the evening of the 24th of this month and sank a British destroyer on the night of the 26th. In addition, another British ship was hit and caught fire. German mountain troops on Crete are pursuing fleeing enemy troops and have reached Suda Bay, capturing many enemy soldiers. The bay is a British naval base and is now free of British troops. Yesterday, German bombers and dive bombers fiercely attacked British positions in northern Crete, sinking a merchant ship and a patrol boat near the island. German anti-aircraft guns shot down two British bombers. Italian troops have landed on Crete. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>London: Military authorities in Cairo stated last night that the battle of Crete is continuing to develop and intensify. The fiercest fighting is in the area between Canea and Maleme. The situation is somewhat unclear, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information. German reinforcements are arriving constantly. The British Empire forces, holding a discontinuous line, are now retreating under German attack. There are enemy sightings in Rethymno and Heraklion. The fighting in these two locations is not coordinated with other areas and is not very important. The main battle is in Maleme. The British Empire forces currently fighting fiercely are mostly New Zealand and Australian troops, with some British troops as well. It was reported yesterday from London that one of the reasons why the British Air Force cannot use bases on Crete is the lack of air defense. The small squadron of British fighter planes moved from Greece to Crete is far fewer than the number of German planes, so it has been withdrawn from the island. It is also reported that Germany has recently reduced its air force stationed in northwestern Europe and transferred a large number of dive bombers and fighters through the Balkans to Greece, a flight distance of 1,200 miles, while British ships transporting military supplies to British troops in North Africa must travel 12,000 miles around the Cape of Good Hope. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin: It was learned this morning from responsible sources that the German troops fighting on Crete are advancing eastward. The British and Greek troops on the east coast of Suda Bay, although they fought fiercely from dangerous positions, were ultimately defeated by the German troops. In addition to obtaining a large amount of military equipment and supplies, the German troops captured hundreds of enemy soldiers. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Rome: The Supreme Command announced today that Italian troops have landed on Crete and are cooperating with German troops already fighting the British there. This announcement marks the first Italian landing on Crete, but the announcement did not state whether the Italian troops were transported to Crete by German or Italian troop transport planes, or whether the Italian troops were paratroopers. Italian bombers and torpedo planes have repeatedly attacked British ships in the eastern Mediterranean, hitting three British cruisers with torpedoes and another with bombs. (May 29th, United Press)</p>
<h3>Three Towns on Crete Heavily Bombed, British Cruiser York Sunk</h3>
<p>London: According to a naval communiqué, the British cruiser York (8,250 tons) must be considered lost. The ship had previously been damaged and was under repair in Suda Bay when the battle of Crete broke out. Since then, it has been repeatedly bombed. The only casualties were two dead and five wounded. The ship was built in 1930. Its main armament consisted of six 8-inch guns and eight 4-inch guns. The ship's speed was 32 knots per hour. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo: A British Army officer was unable to confirm last night that German combat losses on Crete totaled 18,000 men, but they pointed out that this number is equal to more than two paratrooper divisions. It is reported that three divisions of paratroopers landed on Crete, and a fourth division is currently landing. Officials said that although German losses were heavy, detailed losses were difficult to determine. (May 30th, United Press)</p>
<p>London: According to news received by the Greek Embassy in London, the German offensive on Crete is extremely fierce. The three important cities of Canea, Heraklion, and Rethymno have all been heavily bombed. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Air Force in the Middle East Successfully Attacks</h3>
<p>London: A communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East stated that, regarding Crete, on the night of Monday and Tuesday, the British Air Force repeatedly attacked the Maleme airfield occupied by the enemy and was quite successful. When the airfield was heavily attacked during the day, many enemy planes on the field were hit and suffered considerable damage. British fighters intercepted a squadron of Junkers Ju 88 enemy bombers north of the island and shot down three of them. During the night attack on the Maleme airfield, it is believed that five enemy planes on the field were destroyed. Several enemy planes on the nearby beach were also bombed and strafed. Regarding Libya, on the 26th, British planes attacked the port of Benghazi at night, destroying a house. The dike was also hit and caught fire. Near Sidi Barrani, an enemy fighter plane was forced to land and was captured by the British army. A Junkers Ju 52 (troop transport plane) was shot down by artillery fire over Tobruk. On Tuesday, British planes attacked enemy ships off the coast of Africa, and two enemy merchant ships, each with a displacement of 8,000 to 10,000 tons, were hit several times and immediately began to smoke. Regarding Abyssinia, the South African Air Force and the Free French Air Force bombed and strafed the enemy airfield at Gondar and enemy positions near the Omo River and the Gibo River. Regarding Syria, the Aleppo airfield was bombed by British planes on Tuesday, hitting an ammunition depot. Two attacking British planes were lost. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>German Planes Launch Large-Scale Raid on Britain Under Moonlight, Coastal Areas of Northern Germany Also Bombed by British Planes</h3>
<p>London: As the moonlight gradually appeared, large numbers of German night raiders again dropped bombs on various parts of Britain last night and this morning.

<h3>Situation Unchanged on Egyptian Border, No Progress for German Troops East of Mountain Pass, East African Campaign Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>London: A dispatch from Cairo last night stated that regarding the second day of the Nazi invasion across the Egyptian border in the western desert, apart from the occupation of Halfaya Pass, there was little change. Most of the German troops are still on top of the mountain pass, with only a few German soldiers appearing across the mountain pass. Therefore, the scope of the military operations currently underway within the enemy territory is difficult to estimate. German troops have not made significant progress east of the mountain pass. German troops are being transported by trucks, with some attached tanks and planes, but not as many as during the invasion three weeks ago. The fighting is now concentrated on a line six or seven miles long south of a location seven miles from the sea. At the same time, the war in Abyssinia is nearing completion. Although it has become more difficult due to continuous heavy rains, it is still progressing satisfactorily. The strength of the Italian army has diminished and it has lost its fighting spirit, especially suffering from British planes and British army fire. The Italian garrison at Daibatate Fort, halfway between Dessie and Gondar, is now surrounded by a large number of patriotic troops. The important activity in Iraq is air raids. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: It is estimated here today that British troops in Abyssinia must still confront 40,000 Italian troops scattered in the Great Lakes region and Gondar. The total number of prisoners taken after the surrender of the Italian 26th Division is between 80,000 and 90,000. It is expected that there are currently 17,000 Italian troops in Gondar and 25,000 Italian troops in Chima. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent on the Libyan border stated that on Tuesday afternoon, British troops stopped the German troops advancing about two miles east of Sollum. Yesterday, the German troops did not attempt to advance, but appeared to be consolidating the strongholds of Halfaya Pass and Sidi Suleiman, in order to prevent British troops from flanking their right wing and attacking their rear. It is believed that German casualties are many times higher than British casualties. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>British Minister Praises Indian and African Colonial Troops</p>
<p>London: General Sir Frederick Ingram, known as the "Father of the Indian Army," and Minister of War Croft stated in the House of Lords yesterday that General Wavell is simultaneously addressing the North African campaign and completing the conquest of Italian East African colonies. Sir Frederick Ingram said that the authorities have not fully praised the outstanding achievements of the officers and soldiers transferred from the Indian Dominions and colonies in the East African campaign, and he feels quite uneasy about this. Most of these troops come from South Africa, India, and various African colonies. Hitler must have ordered Italian Duke Aosta to try to prolong the war as much as possible in order to restrain the British forces in Abyssinia and consume a large amount of their military supplies, but the war in Abyssinia progressed extremely quickly. When the Italian army collapsed, they secretly buried mines and carried out large-scale destruction, but our Indian friends overcame these difficulties quickly and properly, and no army could have done better. Croft enthusiastically endorsed Sir Frederick Ingram's praise of the imperial troops from India and South Africa, saying that the distance from the coast of East Africa to Addis Ababa is extremely far, but in less than a month, the capital of this Italian East African colony fell. The Axis powers' strategy in East Africa was clearly to seize Egypt and the Suez Canal, and to drive British troops out of the Mediterranean, so our first priority was to eliminate the serious threat of Aosta leading a large army of 250,000 to attack us through Sudan and Suez. The victory in the East African campaign will have a decisive impact on the crucial period we are encountering in the Middle East. The army led by Aosta was said to number 300,000, and more than 90,000 of them have been captured by the Allied forces in East Africa, so it is expected that there are currently 17,000 Italian troops in Gondar and 25,000 Italian troops in Chima.

<h3>British Ships in the Mediterranean Display Power, Sinking Five Italian Ships, Including a Giant 18,000-Ton Liner, German Ships Off European Coast Heavily Attacked</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday's Admiralty communiqué stated that the British Navy has recently sunk an 18,000-ton enemy liner and several other ships. The number of enemy troops and military supplies bound for the North African battlefield that are lost en route is increasing. In addition to the enemy destroyer mentioned in the communiqué of May 23, there are also one troop transport ship with a displacement of 9,000 tons, one oil tanker with a displacement of 7,000 tons, and one giant ammunition ship that were sunk by the British Navy. Another smaller enemy ship was shelled and hit several times. In April, the British Navy intercepted five enemy supply ships sailing south escorted by three Italian destroyers and destroyed them between Sicily and Tripoli. Not only are enemy ships feeling the power of British ships in the Mediterranean, but also ships that the German side has sent to transport supplies along the coast of occupied Europe due to insufficient railway capacity are repeatedly subjected to heavy attacks by the British Air Force during the day. On Wednesday, one German supply ship outside Brest (with a displacement of 5,000 tons), escorted by five armed fishing boats, was attacked by a British Air Force coastal plane and hit by two bombs, gradually sinking. The armed fishing boats all opened fire, but the British plane only sustained two injuries to its fuselage. (May 29th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Central Standing Committee Member Wang Faqin Passes Away in Chengdu; Central Party Headquarters Sends Personnel to Assist with Funeral Arrangements; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sends Condolences to the Wang Family</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Central Standing Committee member Wang Faqin passed away at his residence in Chengdu at 7:00 AM on the 28th due to incurable cancer. Upon hearing the sad news, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed his deep condolences. The Central Party Headquarters specially dispatched a commissioner to Chengdu to assist with the funeral arrangements, and Zhang Qun, a Central Committee member stationed in Chengdu, and Huang Jilu, Chairman of the Committee, are in charge of everything. It is reported that Wang's remains were placed in a coffin tonight and will be buried in Chengdu temporarily within three days. Wang was a native of Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, born in the 42nd year before the founding of the Republic of China. He joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in his early years, followed the National Father of the country in the revolution, and was always elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, he also served as a member of the National Government. At the Fifth Plenary Session in the 29th year of the Republic of China, he was elected as a member of the Central Standing Committee and concurrently served as the Chairman of the Central Pension Committee.

<h3>Those Going Abroad Must Sign Their Names on Their Passports</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Relevant sources stated that anyone using a passport should sign their name on the passport. This is a common practice in all countries. The passports issued by our country also have a space for the passport holder's signature. Those who obtain passports to go abroad should sign their names as soon as they receive the passport. However, many Chinese people do not comply with this. Recently, the authorities in Burma have been very strict in inspecting the passports of foreigners entering the country. Many Chinese officials and businessmen traveling to Burma have been detained. The main reason is that the passports they held were not signed by the passport holder. The Burmese side considers such situations to be illegal. In the future, Chinese people going abroad should pay attention to the passport signature regulations. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>After the US Export Control Act is Implemented in the Philippines, the Axis Powers Cannot Obtain Oil and Metals; Many Cargo Ships Have Stopped Loading</h3>
<p>Manila – The US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, announced at noon today that US President Roosevelt has signed the Export Control Act, extending the export licensing system to the Philippines. From now on, the Axis powers will not be able to obtain metals and vegetable oils from the Philippines. Officials of the Philippine Customs Service have ordered several ships here to stop loading, including the Japanese cargo ship Ikawa Maru, which attempted to load 1,600 tons of iron before the deadline, but ultimately failed. In the first four months of 1941, the quantity of coconut oil, iron ore, manganese, copper, chromium, and hemp transported to Japan broke previous records. Military authorities believe that a large part of it was transshipped to Germany. At the same time, due to the implementation of export controls, President Roosevelt's fireside chat, and Japan's seizure of American goods in Vietnam, the Philippines is also stepping up its defense activities. It is reported that President Quezon will broadcast to the Philippines next week via radio, clarifying the Philippines' position on President Roosevelt's policies. President Quezon said that President Roosevelt's speech was "breathtaking," and therefore it is expected that he will guarantee the full cooperation of the Philippines, making the Philippines a forward post of the American defense line in the Far East. Military circles here said that Japan's activities in Vietnam are a test of whether Washington is too busy paying attention to Europe and can allow the resumption of the southward advance policy. The Philippine Congress is scheduled to convene a special session on June 9 to discuss legislation to adjust the defense of the Philippines and the defense of the United States. At the same time, cargo ships from England have also brought the largest amount of military supplies in the history of the Philippines to supply the American troops. The US garrison in the Philippines is constantly increasing, so additional land has been acquired to provide camps for the newly arrived troops or to build temporary barracks. Troops are exercising daily in the city center of Manila along the city walls, which were used by the Spaniards for defense in the past. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Public Concession Water, Electricity, and Gas to Increase Prices Again Starting in July</h3>
<p>Electricity to Increase by an Additional 50% Surcharge</p>
<p>Water to Increase to 250%</p>
<p>Gas Usage to be Limited, with Several Times the Fee for Exceeding Usage</p>
<p>The three major public utility organizations in the Shanghai Public Concession, namely the Shanghai Power Company, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company, previously requested approval from the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) to appropriately increase monthly fees or limit consumption due to skyrocketing special prices and huge expenses. The Board of Directors referred the case to the Public Utilities Committee for discussion. After the committee convened a regular meeting this Monday to review the reports and original proposals submitted by the respective companies, it found the requests to be justified. It then passed a measure to increase water and electricity fees and limit the consumption of gas. The Board of Directors approved this measure at its regular meeting the day before yesterday, and it is scheduled to take effect on July 1st of this year. However, the people of this city are burdened by the ever-increasing costs of water, electricity, and gas, which places a heavier burden on their lives. It is hoped that the authorities will give it a final consideration, reduce the price and quantity, and lighten the burden on citizens' lives. The details of the various measures are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Electricity Fee Increase</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Power Company previously submitted a report stating that the prices of materials and water rates continue to rise, which has led to a sharp increase in various operating expenses, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, it requested the approval of the Public Works Department (工部局) to levy a [temporary] surcharge of 50% on the basic electricity fee for all types of users, in addition to the current [fuel] and [exchange rate] surcharges, in order to supplement funds. The calculation of this new surcharge will be based on an exchange rate of US$5.25 equivalent to 100 National Currency (國幣). The amount of the surcharge will be adjusted monthly by the Public Works Department (工部局) and the company in accordance with the current calculation method of the [exchange rate] surcharge.</p>
<p>Prices of All Used Items</p>
<p>Have Skyrocketed</p>
<p>It has been found that almost all of the items used by the company are purchased from abroad, and the increase in electricity fees pales in comparison to the rise in the cost of living in this port. For example, the price of No. 2粳米 (japonica rice) was 9.27 yuan per picul (石) in 1928, but it had increased to 125 yuan by May 2nd of this year, an increase of more than twelve times. Similarly, the price of coal per ton was 12.232 yuan in the same year, but it rose to 175.03 yuan on May 2nd of this year, an increase of more than twelve times. The electricity bill for a typical small residential user, which was 3.08 yuan per month in 1928, is 9.55 yuan this year, an increase of 220%. The electricity bill for a large residential user, which was 25.9 yuan per month in the same year, is 97.55 yuan this year, an increase of 277%. The electricity bill for a small factory, which was 154 yuan per month in the same year, is 635.52 yuan this year, an increase of 313%. The electricity bill for a large factory, which was over 28,000 yuan per month in the same year, is over 123,000 yuan this year, an increase of 471%.</p>
<p>New Surcharge</p>
<p>Has Been Approved</p>
<p>Referencing the comparative table of electricity fees in various foreign ports attached by the company, such as Tokyo, [unclear name], Hong Kong, as well as the French Concession and [unclear name] in this port, it can be seen that the electricity fees charged by the company (including all surcharges, together with the surcharge in this case) are indeed the lowest, except for the French Concession. The case has been thoroughly discussed by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局), and the result is that the company's request to increase prices is in accordance with the chartered business regulations and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) and approved at its regular meeting on the 28th of this month, and will be implemented from the date of termination of the electricity usage period for each user on or after July 1st of this year. The new surcharge only applies to the basic electricity fee, and this is hereby declared.</p>
<p>Water Fee Increase</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Waterworks Company submitted a report stating that the prices of goods have continued to rise recently, especially the costs of fuel and electricity. At the same time, the number of allowances issued to employees has also increased, resulting in a sharp increase in various expenses, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, it attached the budget statement of revenue and expenditure for this year and requested the Public Works Department (工部局) to approve the increase of the water surcharge from 110% to 250% in order to increase revenue, supplement funds, and be able to pay the British gold dividends stipulated in the business regulations and allocate depreciation of the company's assets. The Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局) discussed the case and concluded that the company's request to increase prices is in accordance with the provisions of the chartered business regulations and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) and approved at its regular meeting on the 28th of this month, and will be implemented from the date of termination of the water usage period for each user on or after July 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Gas Usage</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Gas Company, in view of the uncertain supply of fuel and in order to prevent gas consumption from exceeding the amount used in the previous year, requested the approval of the Public Works Department (工部局) to implement measures to limit gas consumption. After discussion by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局), it was considered that the request was justified and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) and approved at its meeting on the 18th of this month, and will be implemented. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>New Applications</p>
<p>Will Be Rejected</p>
<p>1.  From June 1st of this year, all new applications for the supply of industrial gas will be rejected. In addition, new applications for the supply of household gas will also be rejected if it is found that there is a need to switch to gas instead of other fuels for economic reasons.</p>
<p>Exceeding the Limit</p>
<p>Will Be Charged Separately</p>
<p>2.  From the date of commencement of gas usage on or after June 1st of this year, the monthly gas consumption of any user shall not exceed the consumption amount of the same usage period in the previous year. If this is not possible, it shall be limited to the consumption amount of the previous period in the current year. If this is still not possible, it shall be limited to the amount reasonably required as estimated by the company. When this limit is exceeded, the excess part will be charged as follows: (A) For the first time exceeding the limit (one month), the current rate will be doubled. (B) For the second time exceeding the limit (one month), the current rate will be tripled. (C) For the third and subsequent exceedances (one month), the current rate will be quadrupled. The above measures are of a temporary nature and may be modified or abolished at any time. The company will separately notify users of their monthly allowable consumption. The fees collected in accordance with the above Item 2 will be allocated by the company to a reserve fund for use in ways that are beneficial to users, as agreed upon by the Public Works Department (工部局) and the company.</p>
<p>Electricity and Gas</p>
<p>Minimum Charge</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Gas Company have provisions for minimum charges for each user. This measure has recently been considered by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局). According to the Shanghai Power Company, from an economic point of view, this charge measure is indeed necessary. However, in view of the current urgent need for the public to conserve electricity, it is planned to temporarily suspend the above measure during the fuel emergency period, except for large users, even if it causes losses to the company. At the same time, the Shanghai Gas Company argues that this measure should be retained, otherwise it will greatly reduce the company's revenue, leading to the need to increase surcharges to compensate for the shortfall in revenue. The Public Utilities Committee believes that the situations of the two companies are completely different. The Power Company is requesting users who are not subject to power reduction restrictions to voluntarily save electricity due to the abnormal fuel supply, while the Gas Company only wants to prevent gas consumption from exceeding the amount used in the previous year. As far as household users' consumption is concerned, this consumption only accounts for a small portion of the Power Company's power output, while it accounts for about 70% of the Gas Company's gas production. In principle, the previous charging measure should be retained. However, in order to avoid hindering the consumption of savers, this fee amount should be reduced according to the percentage of consumption reduction. Therefore, it is recommended that the minimum electricity fee of the Power Company be reduced to 70% of the current amount, and then adjusted according to the situation. At the same time, the Gas Company's charging measure should be retained, but if consumption is actually reduced, the minimum amount of the fee should also be reduced accordingly. The above recommendations have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) at its regular meeting on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>New Appointed Officers of the 4th Marine Regiment of the US, a Total of Ten Field Grade Officers</h3>
<p>Since Colonel Howard took over the command of the 4th Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai, he has been actively rectifying the defenses and strengthening the strength. According to the reporter of Daguang News Agency who inquired from the authorities yesterday, a batch of US military officers will arrive in Shanghai soon. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the President Coolidge liner of the American President Lines in early June. They include Lieutenant Colonel Asted, Majors Ryderly, Woolf, and Jensen, Captains Blanc, Clayke, Lyme, Roe, and Wagner, and Lieutenants Picked and Shofner, a total of ten people.</p>
<h3>Postal Service to Fengqiao, Zhuji, is Open, Telegraph has not Yet Been Restored</h3>
<p>The postal service between Shanghai and various places in eastern Zhejiang, Fengqiao and Zhuji, has been opened. Telegraph equipment is being installed. Although the Ningbo Post Office has been restored, only mail from Ningbo to Shanghai is open, and mail from Shanghai to Ningbo is not yet smooth. However, the post office still accepts mail from Shanghai to various occupied areas in eastern Zhejiang that are lightweight, but the actual delivery is very slow.</p>
<h3>British Nationals Requesting to Enlist, There is No Age Limit</h3>
<p>Mr. Wells, an officer of the British Supplementary Team, recently [unclear] stated in an interview that regarding the request of British nationals in Shanghai to join the British Navy [unclear], he would like to clarify that their age ranges from 19 to 35 years old. It is said that for all British youths who request to join the army and enlist, the authorities have not set a maximum age limit.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Ordered Over 10,000 Tons of Tribute Rice, to Arrive Next Month and Be Sold Immediately, Hong Kong Rice and Tribute Rice Have Different Qualities</h3>
<p>According to the announcement of the Public Works Department (工部局), recently, various newspapers in this port have expressed opinions on the fact that the French Concession (法租界) Public Works Bureau (公董局) will sell Saigon broken rice at a price of 108 yuan per bag or about 87 yuan per picul (石). In this regard, it should be noted that the only difference between the above price and the price of Yang Rice (Rangoon Special Small Broken) sold by the Public Works Department (工部局) is due to the difference in rice quality. Due to the different nature of the above two kinds of Yang Rice, the asking price is also different in the market of this port. Looking at the following comparison, the facts are obvious: On May 20, Rangoon rice was 104 yuan, and Saigon broken rice was 81 yuan; on May 26, Rangoon rice was 115 yuan, and Saigon broken rice was 93 yuan.</p>
<p>Ordering Tribute Rice</p>
<p>Paying a Deposit in Advance</p>
<p>The Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice purchased and shipped to Shanghai by the French Concession (法公董局) is handled by the Import Committee in Shanghai and the Export Committee in Saigon, while the French Concession (法公董局) and the Vietnamese government are in a supervisory position to control it. Foreign firms in this port that operate Vietnamese Yang Rice will no longer be able to trade privately with rice merchants in this city, and must join the Import Committee before they can handle the trade of this tribute rice. Therefore, there are currently 40 foreign firms participating in the Import Committee, such as [Dafu Corporation]. This tribute rice is a futures product for June and will not be shipped to Shanghai until between the 1st and 30th of next month. Currently, various grain stores (雜量行) are required to pay a 50% deposit in advance to the Import Committee when ordering tribute rice, and retail rice shops (零售米號) are also required to pay a 30% to 50% deposit to the grain stores (雜糧行) when purchasing. The amount of transactions concluded by each Import Committee foreign firm must be reviewed and filed with the French Concession (法公董局) on a daily basis. According to rice industry sources, the current quantity of tribute rice ordered by various grain stores (雜糧行) from the Import Committee foreign firms is about 10,000 tons or more. As for when this tribute rice will arrive and be sold, it is not yet determined, but the ships sailing from Saigon to Shanghai will take at most twelve days.</p>
<p>Wholesale Price of Hong Kong Rice</p>
<p>Slightly Increased</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Shanghai Public Works Department (公共租界工部局) on the compensation for each bag of rice returned to Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) by rice shops (米號家) in this city with less than 224 pounds of rice, the average loss per bag of Yang Rice sold by the department is about one and a half pounds. The price sold by the department to each wholesale rice firm (批發米行) is 122.91 yuan per bag, and the price sold by each wholesale rice firm (批發米行) to each rice shop (米號) is 133.50 yuan, with a profit of 10.059 yuan per bag, which is more than double the 4% profit obtained by the rice shops (米號家). In order to make up for the expenses caused by the lack of rice, the department has specially increased the price of Yang Rice ordered by each wholesale rice firm (批發米行) from the Public Works Department (工部局) from 122.91 yuan to 124.70 yuan per bag from yesterday, an increase of 1.79 yuan per bag, but the price sold to the rice shops (米號) is still set at 133.50 yuan per bag, and the retail price is still 110 yuan per picul (石).</p>
<p>Not Paying for Rice</p>
<p>Taking Sales Rights</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) [unclear] by order of the Public Works Department (工部局), revoked the right of 33 rice shops (米號) in the two concessions in this port to sell Hong Kong rice at a fair price. According to the reporter of Pingming News Agency (平明社), the reason for their punishment was that they did not follow the ordering procedures and were slow to pay Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行). After it was published in the newspaper yesterday, they rushed to Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) to request [something]. It is heard that the Public Works Department (工部局) has permitted Tongshang (通商), Futai Xin (福泰新), Jinshengchang (晋盛昌), Yuchengtai (裕成泰), Gongschengchang (公盛昌), Guchangsheng (顧昌盛), Heshungong (和順公), and Taishan (泰山) to restore their profit-making sales of Hong Kong rice. Yesterday, they have paid and delivered goods to the market. Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) is scheduled to move into its office on June 1, and the new address is on the sixth floor of the Asia Petroleum Company Building at No. 1 The Bund. In addition, according to a letter from Yudafeng Rice Shop (裕大豐米號), the shop has not received a notice from the Public Works Department (工部局) to stop selling Hong Kong rice and is operating as usual.</p>
<p>Striking Workers</p>
<p>Have Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>After a part of the workers of the rice shops (米號) in the two concessions went on strike the day before yesterday, the market was not affected because the shops still had apprentices to work with the shop owners. The strikers sent representatives to the Rice Shop Association (米號公會) in Mao Yi Lane (懋益里), Shanhai Pass Road (山海關路), at 2:00 pm yesterday, stating that they were taking into account the business of the rice shops (米號), and on the one hand, they persuaded all the workers to resume work immediately, and on the other hand, they hoped that the association would quickly respond to the conditions put forward by the workers, so as to avoid a stalemate. Therefore, all the workers of the Rice Shop Association (米號業) resumed work yesterday morning. It is also heard that at 10:20 am on the morning of the day before yesterday, someone drove to Huasheng Rice Shop (華盛米店) at No. 233 Weihaiwei Road (威海衛路) to instigate a strike, and was discovered by Deputy Detective Wang Guanren (王關仁) of Chengdu Road Police Station (成都路捕房), who arrested Tong Xinyi (童心一), Chen Zhioren (陳治仁), Wang Chunyuan (王春元), Li Guangtian (李廣田), Zhu Yifei (朱一飛), Li [unclear] (李[unclear]), Tao Guozhang (陶國章), Xiong Fucai (熊福財), Gu Wangxing (顧王興), Xiong Fangzheng (熊方正), Zhu Senyuan (朱森元), Huang Zhongyuan (黄中元), Wang Qiming (王啟明), Zhou Sichun (周思椿), Shen Jinwen (沈金文), Zhang Zhisheng (張至生), Ma Miaogen (馬妙根), Wang Derong (王德榮), Yan Zhongzheng (岩中正), and Chen Wende (陳文德), a total of twenty people, and took them to the police station (捕房). Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First Branch (特一院刑八庭). The police station (捕房) lawyer Qian Xun [unclear] (錢恂[unclear]) stated the facts and requested [unclear] for custody. The court approved the custody and postponed the trial for seven days.</p>

<h3>Today is the Anniversary of the May 30th Movement, All Circles are Somber and Encouraged, Commemorating the Historically Significant Martyrs</h3>
<p>Today is the 16th anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. Due to the special environment, the people of this city, in accordance with the wishes of the concession authorities, will not hold extravagant ceremonies, but will only mourn the great achievements of these historically significant martyrs for the country and the nation with a somber spirit, and will all remotely worship the souls of the martyrs at [unclear] noon. The authorities of the two concessions, because today is a revolutionary anniversary and the end of the Dragon Boat Festival accounting period for the business community, are afraid that unscrupulous elements will cause trouble, so they have decided to implement joint defense for one day in accordance with the joint defense measures. As for the May joint defense, it will be revoked from midnight tomorrow, but ordinary precautions will still exist to ensure the security and order of the concession.</p>
<p>Youth Federation Statement</p>
<p>Commemorative Significance</p>
<p>Today is the 16th anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. The Youth Federation of this city believes that with the current changes in the times, the changes in the international situation, and the Sino-British relations are also very different from those of today sixteen years ago. Therefore, it specially issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, expounding the commemorative significance. The original text is roughly as follows: Today is the sixteenth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. Every year today, we always use a sad and indignant mood to commemorate the martyred worker Gu Zhenghong and countless compatriots. But today we no longer use a sad and indignant mood to commemorate it. We have already taken resolute action to avenge the martyred heroes. Our more than four years of fighting, although it is to strive for the eternal freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation, is also to turn the commemorative day of national humiliation into a glorious holiday. Now our struggle has awakened the illusions of the general imperialists. We believe that the tragedy sixteen years ago will never happen again, because the current era has changed, and the international situation has also changed. Countries that did not understand us in the past now understand us. Not only do they no longer use brutal means to oppress us, but they also actively help us. Compatriots, as long as we can work hard and struggle, any difficult cause can be successful. Victory will always belong to us.</p>
<h3>China's Mainland is Progressing Day by Day, Economic Power is Expanding</h3>

<h3>Record of a Brain Dissection by Wang Xianli</h3>
<p>Last night, I saw a bloody human head in my dream.</p>
<p>Since developing an interest in psychology, I've always liked to analyze my dreams, seeking their roots. Most of the time, I manage to find the source of the dream, relieving a burden in my heart.</p>
<p>Of course, this time was no exception. I was just about to analyze it when I chuckled to myself. Didn't I witness Dr. Su dissecting a human head yesterday? And I watched it intently for two and a half hours!</p>
<p>I had long heard of the advancements in modern medicine, that it had reached the point of being able to dissect the brain. I always regretted not having seen it with my own eyes. Once, I met Dr. Su Ningbo Sheng, the director of the Neuropsychiatry Department of the Red Cross Society, and learned that he could perform brain surgery. I told him about my desire to see brain surgery, and to my surprise, he agreed immediately, saying he would definitely notify me next time he had the opportunity.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, a nurse called to inform me that Dr. Su would be operating at 2 PM tomorrow and asked me to come and watch.</p>
<p>I chuckled to myself. Dr. Su was so serious about this operation that he had a nurse call to make an appointment, as if inviting me to dinner or a movie. Great! I would not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 22nd, at 2 PM, I walked into the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road under the scorching May sun. In the operating room preparation area, I saw Dr. Su Zongsheng, already dressed in white gown and trousers, vigorously scrubbing his arms with soap and a brush at the white porcelain sink. When he saw me, he greeted me with a smile and introduced me to the other two doctors and several nurses. A tall doctor said to me, "Are you not afraid?" I didn't know how to answer for a moment. I勉强勉强 said, "I think I'm not afraid."</p>
<p>Another assistant physician led me into the changing room. I took off my outer clothes, and he put a white cloth cap on my head, covered my mouth and nose with a white cloth mask, and put on a snow-white short gown. I looked at myself in the mirror, looking every bit like a doctor! An imposter doctor.</p>
<p>The lady in charge of the operating room came to the changing room and asked me suspiciously, "Are you really not afraid?" She explained that it was not allowed to watch surgery casually, but since Dr. Su had invited me, it was fine, but "Are you really not afraid?" she asked, her eyes wide open in English. I didn't know what to do. I still answered the same way: "I think I'm really not afraid." The doctor who led me into the changing room嘴角嘴说, "If you're afraid, just tell me." I nodded.</p>
<p>When I came out of the changing room, Dr. Su was still washing his arms. He said that usually before an operation, he always spent more than half an hour washing his arms. After washing with soap, it wasn't enough; he also had to wash with disinfectant. After washing with disinfectant, he had to cut his nails. After cutting his nails, he had to wash again. After washing, he wiped them dry with alcohol and then put on gloves.</p>
<p>Dr. Su asked an assistant to bring the skull model from the office while saying that the patient was a woman in her forties or fifties who had come to see him two years ago, complaining of long-standing trigeminal neuralgia on her right cheek. Initially, he treated her with injections, but injections were not a permanent solution. A week ago, the patient came to him again because the pain was unbearable and she had been unable to sleep or eat for several days and nights. Dr. Su explained that surgery was the only permanent solution, and the patient agreed, her determination reflecting the depth of her suffering.</p>
<p>Half of the skull model's cranium had already been sawn off, with the skull cap connected by a rope, and the mouth could be opened and closed, resembling a horror movie scene. Dr. Su was still washing his hands, instructing an assistant to point out the part of the head he would be operating on and explaining the origin and path of the three sets of nerves that passed through the right cheekbone.</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM, several white-clad angels swarmed the patient from another room into the operating room. We followed behind, and the snow-white operating room was bustling with activity. The patient was completely wrapped in white cloth, already under general anesthesia, and the hair on the right side of her head had been completely shaved. She was sound asleep on the operating table, occasionally snoring.</p>
<p>The operating room was rectangular with a semicircular extension. The semicircular part was entirely fitted with white frosted glass windows to allow light to penetrate. Above the operating table, six bright electric lights were shining. Next to the operating table, there were two trays for gauze, cotton, medicine, and all the surgical instruments, managed by a nurse.</p>
<p>Before the surgery, an assistant physician cut open a blood vessel in the patient's neck and used a drip to infuse her with glucose and saline to prevent excessive bleeding or other accidents. Another nurse sat to the patient's left, monitoring her pulse and blood pressure.</p>
<p>At 2:25 PM, the atmosphere in the operating room was at its most tense. With the help of two assistant physicians and a team of five nurses, and under the gaze of two other doctors and me, this imposter doctor, Dr. Su began operating on the patient's head.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Food - Rice Hoarders Repeatedly Tried to Stir Up Trouble - Fortunately, the Arrival of Goods Was Continuous, and Their Ambitions Were Not Realized</h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice on the market yesterday initially rose and then fell, and the market remained volatile. The price rose by two or three yuan in the morning market and fell by a small amount in the midday market. There were few transactions in the afternoon, and the market lacked momentum. As a result, the price was only one or two yuan higher than the night before. In the early market, due to the storm in the Pacific, the buying interest was quite strong, and the re-export by Japanese merchants and the domestic demand were both active. Hoarders were extremely excited. Small traders immediately raised their prices to as high as 120.05 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rose to 126 yuan, No. 1 to 121 yuan, broken rice to 95 yuan, and Minden to 123 yuan. Siamese No. 2 rose to 119 yuan, 　 rice to 108 yuan, British Yao's Saigon No. 1 to 145.5 yuan to 144.5 yuan, Xiaowen to 141 yuan to 140 yuan, and broken rice to 107 yuan to 106 yuan. However, after the market price rose, actual sales became sluggish. The international storm also did not develop beyond what was expected. Large households and hoarders also had to wait for inquiries after the holiday. Many small floating households took the opportunity to sell at high prices, so the market immediately turned weak. As a result, the closing price for Saigon No. 1 was 124 yuan, No. 2 was 119 yuan, Minden was 123 yuan, 120 yuan, Xiaojiao was 118.5 yuan, 118 yuan, Tokyo broken rice was 111 yuan to 109.5 yuan, and special broken rice was 114 yuan, 93 or 4 yuan. Statistics showed that the market was tight at first and then weak, and the price was still about one or two yuan higher than the previous market. The total transaction volume of spot rice for the whole day was 13,000 to 4,000 bags. There are thousands of tons of original bags of British Huasi.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's publicly sold rice has also arrived in Shanghai. The Yihua Shipping Company's Dingsheng Wheel transported 10,000 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, docking at the Luo Qifu Wharf for unloading. The French company's postal ship B.DE.S. Pierre transported a large batch of foreign rice directly from Saigon and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading. The exact number will be reported after it is investigated today. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, many national rice varieties such as thick and thin japonica rice arrived due to the rush for the holiday. Moreover, those porters have limited financial resources and urgently need to sell, so despite the tight supply of foreign rice, the selling intention was very loose. Therefore, although the sales were quite good, the market did not change much, and was even slightly soft. Kunshan fresh japonica rice was priced at 132-3 yuan, Zhongguan was 130 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice were priced at 134 yuan for special grade and 131.5 yuan for ordinary grade. Zhongguan was priced at 130 yuan. The original package was opened with wood.</p>
<p>Due to the rebound in the price of foreign rice, people's hearts are good, and the road ahead is not only becoming more prosperous in shops, but also in the retail appetite for rice carriers, so the market price has been raised by two or three yuan across the board due to the full sale. Hong Kong Tuanli was priced at 115-6 yuan, Weili was priced at 113-4 yuan, Juezhi was priced at 111 yuan, glutinous green beans were priced at 105 yuan, Juezhi was priced at 101 yuan, and national glutinous rice was priced at 115-6 yuan.</p>
<p>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the industry will be closing accounts. According to practice, there will be no market for one day.</p>
<h3>Flour Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>The current foreign flour market is showing signs of improvement. Generally, there is no excitement for speculative trading on the side of the Dragon Boat Festival, and local sales are not lonely. Because the price of rice has gradually rebounded in recent days, people's hearts have been rejuvenated. Those who hold goods often hold on, and the depressed atmosphere of the past has dissipated. The opening price of Golden Dragon flour was 29.9 yuan and 29.85 yuan, once rising by 67 cents, and the subsequent market slightly loose, only opening at 19.7 yuan. The opening price of the Fortress flour was 30.05 yuan to 30.03 yuan. There were 10,000 bags of strong transactions, but the current inventory is full, and the foothold of the market is still difficult to consolidate, and it still cannot get rid of the floating and unstable state. There is no market for wheat. The market is closed for one day for the Dragon Boat Festival today.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous - Soybeans and Corn - Prices Fluctuate by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grains and oil cake market remained mediocre. However, the market atmosphere was still enthusiastic during the day, but actual sales were too weak, and the environmental stimulus was not enough to arouse the new excitement of speculators. Therefore, there were no huge changes in various market prices. Due to the lack of soybean stalls in yesterday's soybean market (300 bags of Jiaozhou beans and 100 bags of Guide beans), prices fell by about half a yuan. There was local demand for corn, and the market rose slightly by three to five cents, with 1,000 packets of sales. The recent stack of soybean cakes still has an appetite for absorption, so the kick-the-ball business was quite tight in the first half of the day, and prices once rose by five to six cents. In the second half of the day, the selling pressure increased, and the kick-the-ball was forced to decline. As a result, the fluctuation was only between one and two cents compared to the previous day's market. A total of 44,000 to 5,000 pieces of spot and forward cakes were traded.</p>
<p>There were also 255 bags of beans and 1,290 pieces of soybean cake, all of which were shipped to Singapore today (the 30th).</p>
<h3>Finance - Foreign Exchange Covered Short Positions and Engaged in Arbitrage - All at Once</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was dominated by HSBC's standard exchange rates, which did not change. British and American exchange rates softened with the market as Chinese merchants and speculators covered their short positions and engaged in arbitrage. Hong Kong telegrams also absorbed the market. Foreign banks took the opportunity to raise prices, and there was suddenly a lot of air at noon. The US exchange rate once softened to 5.275 yuan, and British gold softened to 3 pence 3125. After learning that the previous rumor was not accurate, the US dollar alone rebounded slightly. In the afternoon, the Japanese merchant bank was less aggressive, and speculators watched. Banks were more willing to sell, and the market stabilized until the close of the market. Both exchange rates were squeezed by 0.03125, and trading was sparse.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Continues to Buy In</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign and other silver coins, British, American, and Indian coins have not changed. Among the exchange rates of various countries, only the British exchange rate against Shanghai increased by 0.03125, and the rest remained unchanged.

The bank's selling price for spot British exchange rates immediately tightened by 0.015625 at the beginning of the market, to 3 pence 328125. The US dollar remained unchanged at 5.4375 yuan. Chinese merchants and speculators first came to settle at the above price but failed to obtain it. It was also heard that Hong Kong telegrams also bought in positions, and the situation appeared to be softening. HSBC's posted exchange rates did not change. After the silver equalization tax was still levied at 23.75%, speculators tried to arbitrage US dollars in May and June at 5.40625 yuan. It was heard that Hong Kong telegrams also came to pay in at the same price. Foreign banks were not willing to sell. Near noon, amidst rumors of prosperity, it softened to 5.375 yuan. After learning that it was inaccurate, it rebounded slightly. The afternoon closing price for British gold was 3 pence 3125, and the US dollar was 5.40625 yuan.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Rumor Has Ceased</p>
<p>Although the Japanese Bank Mitsui absorbed US dollars in June at 5.40625 yuan in the afternoon, because foreign banks still had a supply, speculators watched, and the situation stabilized. Spot US dollars for the June period were 3 pence 3125, and the US dollar was 5.40625 yuan. Compared to the previous day's closing price, British exchange rates were all squeezed by 0.03125.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Surges, Spot Prices Already Showing Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was red-hot. Tight conditions persisted, prices continued to rise in large volumes, fluctuating around the 6,410 yuan mark. This was a continuation of the upward trend from the previous day. Foreign exchange remained tight, and general sentiment was nervously strong. From the opening of the market in the morning, the price rose to the 6,400 yuan level, and the momentum continued upwards. Gold firms and exchange dealers engaged in arbitrage selling, causing the price to retreat several times to within 6,400 yuan, reaching 6,392 yuan. Around noon, an unfounded rumor suddenly emerged. Securities firms, money shops, and individual investors rushed to buy, causing the U.S. dollar exchange rate to weaken to 5.375 yuan. The price then surged to 6,440 yuan. When it was discovered that the previous rumor was inaccurate, those with long positions rushed to close them out, and Guangdong merchants entered the market to sell. The upward momentum immediately reversed. In the afternoon, Kung Wo also aggressively sold, causing the price to retreat again to within 6,400 yuan.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Two Days of Jumps in Cloth Prices Trigger Profit-Taking; Double Horse Reaches a High of 1,460 Yuan; Suddenly Strong Demand for Coarse and Fine Yarn from Hong Kong Merchants</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, initially rose yesterday, then remained flat, but the trend was still firm. However, after two days of jumps, some of which were as high as 100 yuan, profit-taking was inevitable, and traders then re-entered the market. The market saw three changes in one day. However, the spot yarn business has improved greatly compared to the past. Hong Kong merchants bought around 2,000 bales of coarse and fine yarn, including 510 bales of 20-count yarn. The remaining 2-3 count, Yu Ji, Da Fa 20-count, Yu Cheng herding and 10-count coarse yarn totaled 1,500 bales. This further boosted confidence among various parties. According to the market, some foreign buyers have already emerged, waiting for prices to ease slightly before buying again, which would lighten the underlying pressure. What the inside story is, outsiders of course cannot know. 20-count Double Horse reached a high price of 1,460 yuan and a low price of 1,438 yuan. In the afternoon, with today being the Dragon Boat Festival and the market about to close, gray market trading was scarce. The initial price was 1,438 yuan, then 1,440 yuan among those in the know, with the final price being 1,439 yuan. The yarn market is still fluctuating.

<h3>Cotton Market Good</h3>
<p>The situation with spot cotton is slightly good. This is because spot yarn sales are brisk, and factories, with strong sales of finished goods, will replenish their raw materials, so there is hope for development in both coarse and fine cotton. However, yesterday, with the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, firms lacked interest, and actual transactions were very quiet. Only Middling was traded, opening at 100 pieces at a warehouse price of 420 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai: foreign firms' cotton trading was slightly lively due to the stable yarn market. In addition to continuous small-volume transactions of Brazilian cotton among traders, factories such as Bao Feng also purchased a total of 300 bales of Middling, with current selling prices around 350 yuan. As a result, there is hope for a turnaround in the cotton market.</p>
<p>New York cotton initially rose due to unfavorable weather for agriculture, but subsequently fell due to profit-taking and Washington political news that the Smith bill favored shorts. As a result, closing prices were up or down 32 points depending on the delivery month. Indian cotton remained suspended. It is predicted that the market situation at the opening today will be 2 to 8 rupees higher than yesterday.</p>

It was recently heard that a certain firm had 1,700 tons of Mentougou white coal arriving at the port, the first new arrival after the war. However, sales have not yet started.

The standard, which had been weak, once again became firm. Yesterday, the asking price was 400 yuan per dan, slightly more than ten yuan higher than the previous market.</p>

The public and private primary and secondary schools in these nine counties have all suffered losses.

It is now found that although the counties have been successively recovered, the number of schools suspended due to the war is quite large. In addition to the secondary schools having separate relief measures and being supervised to quickly resume classes, arrangements should also be made to accommodate the primary school students and teachers. The department has also received an order from the Ministry of Education to provide immediate relief. In order to unify the methods, seven relief measures have been formulated: (1) The school buildings and equipment of primary and secondary schools and national schools in townships (towns) that have suffered losses should be repaired and supplemented by county allocations and by supervising the townships (towns) where the schools are located to raise funds. Private schools should be handled by school boards allocating funds to restore classes in the shortest possible time. (2) Schools suspended due to the war, whose school buildings and equipment have not been damaged, should be ordered to resume classes on a specific date. (3) The original principals and teachers should be re-employed in all schools that resume classes. (4) Students who have moved to other places from the war zone with their parents should request to transfer to equivalent primary schools in their relocated locations. (5) In addition to the existing primary schools in various places accommodating as many primary school students withdrawn from the war zone as possible, the county government should increase the number of classes in public and private primary schools as needed to accommodate them. (6) The expenses required for increasing the number of classes, if belonging to township schools, should be allocated by the county or local authorities. Private schools should be allocated by the school boards.

<h3>Li Huitang Talks About South China's Expedition Aspirations: A Group of Nineteen to Depart in February</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong, 15th Dispatch) The South China Football Team is embarking on a Southeast Asian expedition. A group of nineteen, led by team leader Chen Jingtao and captain Li Huitang, departed from Hong Kong at 8:30 this morning aboard the "Female Micro" vessel, heading first to Singapore. After playing three matches in Singapore, they will proceed to Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Selangor, Penang, and other cities, with a duration of two months. The expected return is in mid-July. According to Li Huitang's pre-departure statement, he has three aspirations for this trip: (1) Singapore currently has two first-class Chinese football teams, with no shortage of emerging talents whom I (Li himself) have yet to meet. I sincerely hope this trip will discover outstanding individuals. (2) Foreign teams that come to Singapore for football matches often have the pleasant feeling of "good ball skills, good audience, and good referees." Overseas Chinese compatriots support the games, not seeking victory or defeat, but hoping for satisfactory performances with good sportsmanship. I sincerely hope that this good atmosphere in Singapore can return with our team to Hong Kong. (3) Sports development in Singapore is very widespread. In my opinion, comparing football talents between Singapore and Hong Kong, Singapore should be ranked first. Singaporean overseas Chinese children are very fond of sports, lively and robust, truly worthy of being called the new youth of the great era. Furthermore, it is decided that in addition to the team's entire elite, the South China expedition team will also borrow Wei Weiquan, Xu Cheng, and Zhong Yongsen, three major generals from the Eastern Club, making the team's strength even more formidable.</p>

<h3>Zongzi</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Visiting a friend, I had just pushed open the door when the aroma of ham zongzi permeated my senses!</p>
<p>"Ah... how perfect, how perfect, eat it while it's hot."</p>
<p>Speaking wouldn't cause any harm, eating was the priority.</p>
<p>At that moment, it seemed that life was just a zongzi, all thoughts vanished, and eating was all that mattered. I originally wanted to ask about the matter I entrusted to him, but I was intimidated by his ravenous "eating posture" and didn't dare to speak.</p>
<p>Chewing stopped, he smacked his lips, and then shrugged his shoulders in a somewhat Hollywood-esque manner. "Are you free today?"</p>
<p>In fact, asking that question was equivalent to not asking, he knew very well that I was idle all day long.</p>
<p>"Yes!" I couldn't help but lick my tongue, the taste of ham had indeed been missed for three months, fragrant and crisp.</p>
<p>"Another year easily passes by, it's Dragon Boat Festival again, damn, time flies by so fast!" He temporarily "composed" a "poem", looking utterly moved!</p>
<p>I really couldn't think of anything to say, even searching through the corners of my brain. After a long while, I squeezed out a meaningless sentence that was neither here nor there: "What have you been doing lately?"</p>
<p>"Plenty, plenty," he began to count on his fingers, "Eating tofu at cram schools, flirting in movie theaters, strolling around dance halls, sitting in cafes; or else following women in the park and whistling..." Then a "shush" sound, the aroma of zongzi was tempting.</p>
<p>"You have a strong sense of elegance." I am also "witty" sometimes, and I often consider this "remarkable".</p>
<p>Probably because everyone is from a land of propriety and righteousness, we "socialized" very politely with each other for half an hour before I "opened the skylight." So, I felt myself forcing a smile on my face. "Any progress on the matter I asked you about?"</p>
<p>"Oh--" he fell straight down from the clouds, blinking his eyes, "This... I'm still thinking of a way."</p>
<p>How fortunate! At least he didn't refuse, he "is still" thinking of a way.</p>
<p>Leaving his door, I "vaguely" remembered that when I ate zongzi last year, I also took the "still in progress" reply from his house back to my hometown!</p>
<p>Year after year, there is always zongzi to eat every year.</p>
<h3>Fixed Rice</h3>
<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>Our director strode into the office. As soon as he entered, he announced:</p>
<p>"Reporting a good news to everyone, we can also order the 'Hong Kong Rice' fixed by the Public Works Bureau, priced at one hundred and ten yuan per dan. Each bag is calculated as one dan and two dou and a half, totaling one hundred and thirty-seven and a half yuan in national currency. Each person can order a maximum of two bags, and a deposit of seventy yuan in foreign currency is required for each bag, but the bags must be returned!"</p>
<p>After a pause, he raised his voice again——</p>
<p>"If anyone wants it, you need to decide today, so I can let my wife handle it."</p>
<p>Then the colleagues became restless, because this was a major matter concerning "the people's food." Everyone felt a sense of relief, as if having asthma, they felt a little better.</p>
<p>But at the time, everyone couldn't decide because they all had to go home and discuss how many bags to order.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the office became lively again, with everyone discussing. However, some people had rice at home and were willing to give up their rights. So, everyone contacted each other, "Can you let me have the rice under your name?"</p>
<p>"Sir, I'll order four bags!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Shao, I'll order two bags!"</p>
<p>Before long, there were already thirty bags of rice.</p>
<p>The next day, Director Shao came to report the news again, saying that the rice could not be directly picked up from the "foreign firm", or they would have to deliver it. Instead, it had to be handled by a designated "rice store." This work was to be handled by a rice store opened by one of our colleagues (note that it's a colleague).</p>
<p>Of course, none of us objected, as long as we could get the rice! Fortunately, not every rice store belongs to the "vermin class"!</p>
<p>A day later, even more "specific measures" arrived, saying that ×× Rice Store, due to the troublesome procedures and "unmentionable losses," had to come up with the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) Each bag will be calculated based on its actual weight, and a price of one dan and two dou will be charged for the time being, because the size of the incoming packages varies, and there will be losses and gains.</p>
<p>(2) Those who want bags will have to pay a bag deposit of five yuan in national currency first.</p>
<p>(3) Each bag will be charged an additional one yuan in national currency for handling.</p>
<p>But the colleagues suddenly reacted like a tidal wave. The reason being——</p>
<p>"We are all colleagues, and we can buy it outside anyway. Why do we have to bother our friends? Let's withdraw, to save trouble."</p>
<p>Suddenly, sixteen bags were withdrawn!</p>
<p>The first one to make the withdrawal was me - busy writing checks - because the payment was made in cash when the money was collected, but it was all deposited into the bank. To get a refund, I had to write checks.</p>
<p>In this way, we finally ordered the rice, and we also bothered a colleague, but the fifty or sixty yuan earned by ×× Rice Store "cannot be discounted"!</p>

<h3>"Grab One"</h3>
<p>— Qishui</p>
<p>A whole day has passed, and I haven't put anything in my stomach.</p>
<p>Ah, my stomach is protesting, crying out in hunger. I hurriedly tightened my belt and shouted, "Be good, just hold on a little longer, just a moment longer, and the 'cheap rice' will be delicious!" So I finally managed to drag my bony legs.</p>
<p>The road is long, and no fuel has been added—a few dollars worth of gasoline. Others burn it for fun, but I can't even afford sesame seed cakes and fried dough sticks. Take a bus? I've already emptied my pockets, I can't.</p>
<p>"Sir, please help! Grab one!" Suddenly, a woman's panting voice, I quickly looked up, the woman was stretching out both hands, posing as if she wanted to run but not. Looking back quickly, a... let's call him a scoundrel, holding a paper bag, had already run very far. The woman sighed, a long one.</p>
<p>"Please help, grab one!" Six words, no different from six bayonets, piercing my every cell?</p>
<p>My stomach is crying out in hunger again, but this time it's crying even harder.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouniao</p>
<p>(8) Perceptible Friendship</p>
<p>"You're not Yu Hua, are you also afraid of that scoundrel Yuan Baofan?"</p>
<p>"Only a fool would be afraid of him!" Yu Kun almost jumped straight out of bed. "But since you mentioned Old Liu, I want to ask how he's been lately? You two are both writers, you must have some news!"</p>
<p>Mentioning Liu Yuhua, an unpleasant feeling arose in Qiu Haitang's heart again.</p>
<p>"He's been performing in Shanghai, but southerners love to watch local plays, and Old Liu hasn't been able to make a name for himself yet. Last year, Li Yufang came back from Shanghai and told me that his situation was very bad, and he had even started smoking opium: I immediately wired him two hundred yuan, and also wrote a long letter, urging him to quit smoking and come back to the north as soon as he had the chance, just follow me onstage, and we won't have to worry about not becoming popular. Who knew that after this letter went out for a long time, I never received a reply from him, I guess my words urging him to quit smoking were too strong and made him angry..." Qiu Haitang said this long passage in a row, only then did he feel his strength was a little lacking, but generally speaking, his condition today was indeed much better than yesterday.</p>
<p>"You were being superfluous! How can they sing Tan-style male roles without smoking? If they don't smoke, can they still be considered Tan-style male roles?" Yu Kun couldn't help but tease him like this.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang also knew that he was trying to distract him from his thoughts, so that he wouldn't add another layer of sadness because of Yuhua, so he immediately shifted the topic back to the main subject.</p>
<p>"Enough idle talk, Second Brother, are you ultimately willing to go or not?"</p>
<p>"Even if I don't want to go, I doubt you'd let me off." Yu Kun's hand was again fumbling in his pocket for his last cigarette, but he ultimately didn't take it out. "Anyway, this kind of demon-subduing and monster-catching task can also be considered my specialty, I'm not afraid of Zhao Sirongkui and that gang of people flying up into the sky!"</p>
<p>However, the reality was not so, when he rushed to Beijing the next day, because several days had already passed, Rongkui, Jin the big guy, and several servants inside and outside Qiu Haitang's house who had been stirring up trouble had already fled and disappeared, leaving only Zhao Si, who had not done anything significant, sitting there guarding the house.

<h3>The Nutritional Problems of Shanghai Residents</h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," under various complex causes such as control, hoarding, and manipulation, the soaring prices of various commodities have undoubtedly posed an extremely serious threat to the lives of its millions of residents. The general public is feeling even more difficult lives due to the severe impact of rising prices. At the same time, the nutritional problems of residents are seriously brewing here.</p>
<p>No matter in which corner, especially in relatively poorer areas, one can always see many people with various morbidities due to malnutrition; this situation is obviously extremely unfavorable to a society.</p>
<p>According to the Public Works Bureau's investigation report, the recent food prices are due to the expansion of control over goods entering Shanghai, resulting in scarce supplies. The supply of aquatic products such as fish has also sharply decreased due to the coastline being blockaded. In addition, hoarding, manipulation, and profiteering have contributed to extremely high prices. According to the Bureau's statistics, besides rice, which need not be discussed, the price of tofu per piece in 1936 (i.e., before the Shanghai Battle) was 0.0072 yuan, but now it has increased fivefold. Green vegetables originally cost only 0.035 yuan per catty, but now they are twice as expensive. Radishes, potatoes, leeks, bean sprouts... etc., which have always been regarded as the most common and basic food, have now risen more than five times. Fresh pork cost only 0.292 yuan per catty in 1936, but now it costs 1.120 yuan. Fresh fish originally cost only 0.163 yuan per catty, but recently they have risen sevenfold. Other foods rich in nutrients such as chicken eggs, lard, and fruits have now been affected by high prices and have greatly reduced the intake of the general public.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the authorities launched the National Nutrition Research Association, which convened experts to study the distribution quantity and value of nutritional elements of general foods such as grains, beans, vegetables, meat, sugar, and lard, in order to meet scientific and wartime needs.</p>
<p>The severity of the nutritional problems of Shanghai residents is obviously greater than in other places, and the urgency of remedial measures is what everyone is concerned about.</p>
<p>The Central Health Administration recently conducted a thorough review of individual nutrition problems at the National Health Conference. And according to scientific methods, it set seven standards for remedying general nutritional deficiencies; these can also be used as a reference for Shanghai residents, and are now specially offered to Shanghai residents for reference: (1) Use more beans and coarse grains, as the overly simple (incomplete amino acids) of rice protein is harmful to nutrition. (2) Vigorously encourage chicken, fish, and livestock farming, so that everyone can enjoy meat foods and improve our lack of animal protein. (3) Promote brown rice and dark flour, improve steaming methods and avoid bad habits such as discarding rice soup, so as to avoid the waste of vitamins and minerals. (4) Eat more vegetables and fruits, if vegetables are to be cooked, it should be for the purpose of sterilizing and removing parasites. It should not be cooked for too long, so as not to reduce or eliminate vitamins. (5) Make more use of sunlight to supplement the deficiency of vitamin D. (6) Within the scope of economic possibility, add oil and fat to adjust food, so as to increase the lubrication of food.</p>
<p>The severity of the public nutrition problem brewing in Shanghai is already undeniable; I hope this will attract everyone's attention. Of course, we cannot ignore the actual situation at this time and place, and merely "talk about food and count treasures", which will inevitably be ridiculed, but within the possible scope, this is not a superfluous proposal.</p>

<h3>Fragments of the Ice Skating Performance: Ever-Changing...Like Heavenly Horses Flying; Painted Faces Take the Stage...Unexpectedly Opera Steps and Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Qian Di</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yong'an Ice Skating Rink held a grand technical performance and a costumed Peking opera to commemorate its third anniversary. This can also be said to be a stimulating and fresh piece of news, a first in Shanghai. By 3:30 in the afternoon, the surroundings of the ice skating rink were already packed, with many male and female ice skating enthusiasts focusing their attention on the empty rink. After a while, the radio reported: "Technical performance begins!" Then, twelve members of the ice skating team wearing yellow shirts and black trousers, formed a long line and entered the rink. The leader was Shen Weihou, a veteran of the ice skating world from over a decade ago, and the audience gave him warm applause.</p>
<p>The performance began!</p>
<p>The whole rink was quiet, everyone watched breathlessly. The first program was "Third Anniversary Commemoration," and all the team members skated around the rink three times. Next were: "Plum Blossom Stakes", "Golden Rooster Hanging Upside Down", "Antarctic Crane Playing", "Lotus Spin", "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow", "Balance Scale", "Bomber", "Cartwheel", "Dragon Gate Formation". Among these performances, Miao Huaiqiu's "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow" and Shen Weide's leadership of "Bomber" were the most brilliant. "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow" started with three people drawing eight-shaped steps with their feet, and then Mr. Miao passed through their legs with a low one-word step. Afterwards, the number of people gradually increased until he passed through twelve people, and the audience shouted loudly: "Good skill!" In addition to the "boom boom" sound made by the ice skating shoes, the "Bomber" also had the national flag of our great Republic of China on the nose of the plane. When the national flag flew in the rink, the audience spontaneously clapped, which showed everyone's inner enthusiasm for loving the country.</p>
<p>The so-called "Costumed Peking Opera" is that the ice skating team members wore ice skating shoes, dressed up as female roles, and played young male roles, actually taking the stage in painted faces, and there were also gongs and drums, and also huqin, which was a different flavor from the performances of famous actors such as "Golden" and "Carlton".</p>
<p>The "Costumed Peking Opera" started at 7:00 in the evening. What they performed was "Battlefield Lovers", with ice skating rink coach Ding Jinfu playing the flag bearer, Zhao Guojie playing Wang Botang, and Miao Huaiqiu playing Dongfang Shi. At the beginning, four team members dressed as flag-waving and cheering people, meeting the audience with various different poses. Shanghai people probably saw for the first time people wearing opera costumes who could not wear boots, but instead replaced them with ice skating shoes. This is not considered strange, the good show is still in the back!</p>
<p>When the flag bearer came out, he held a memorial tablet in his hands, and his ghostly face made the whole audience laugh, and the up-and-down steps in his feet showed his extraordinary skills.</p>
<p>Shen Weide came out with a large knife in his hand, with a swallow step, his feet were flat and his hands straight, his posture was beautiful, he really deserved to be a veteran of the ice skating world.</p>
<p>Miao Huaiqiu's Dongfang Shi came out with a twisting posture, wielding a gun in his hand, delicate and unrestrained, like a gentle dragon breaking free from a rabbit, a heavenly horse flying. Then Zhao Guojie's Wang Botang also came out, his stage steps were very steady, and although his posture with the spear was not as good as that of a Peking opera actor, he also had considerable skill.</p>
<p>Regarding the singing aspect, because I am a layman, I don't like to listen to it very much, I just watched the tricks of playing the gun, and I was quite interested. The gun came and went, the gun went and came, sometimes falling, sometimes rising, giving way on this side, pushing on that side, ever-changing, with many styles. I really doubt how you can have such great skills with ice skating shoes on your feet?</p>
<p>After watching the performance, I thought to myself: "Ice skating, this child's play, is both a sport and entertainment, it gives people great benefits for the health of their bodies and the regulation of their minds."</p>

<h3>Symphony of Drama and Film</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Since Li Hong married Yu Guang, she has been pregnant, so she had to speed up her work in "Where the Soul Returns," which she starred in at Lianhe. At the same time, Yang Xiaozhong's another horror film after "Zombie Revenge" "Tomb Human Slave" is scheduled to be jointly performed by the original cast members Li Hong and Jiang Ming, and they are now looking for a female lead early.</p>
<p>After Ai Wu's article "On the Bad Tendencies of the Ping Opera Circle" was published in the previous issue of Shanghai Weekly, it caused the resentment of all Ping Opera critics in Shanghai due to its distorted content. Yesterday, they specially jointly wrote a letter to Flit, the editor of the newspaper, raising three questions and asking Ai Wu to be responsible for answering them.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's "Red in Iron Window" was unanimously praised by public opinion after its premiere. The content of the whole drama completely exposes the deformed phenomenon after the August 13th Shanghai battle, which can be compared with Xia Yan's stage play "Suspended City".</p>
<p>After playwright Yu Ling arrived in Hong Kong, he changed his style and began to write film scripts. The story outline still imitates the principles of "Flowers Splattered with Tears" and "Night Shanghai", depicting the current state of Shanghai. According to his letter to a friend, he said that he will be able to finish the script soon, the film title has not been determined, and the script will be prepared for production by the Xinsheng Company.</p>

The company originally planned to hold a celebration to celebrate its eighth anniversary, but now it is known that the authorities believe that this event is close to extravagance, so it plans to change to electing famous films, which is more meaningful. It is reported that it is planned to elect two representative works, one representing before the war and one representing after the war, limited to the company's productions. Now the owner of Lianhe, Zhang Yangkun, has authorized the distribution department to plan everything.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden</h3>
<p>— Li Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Gongsun’s Sword Qi Initially Emerges, Part One</p>
<p>What was the purpose of this visit? It was nothing more than to expose the dark secrets of that adulterous couple. Firstly, to let Wang Yongtai know the truth of the matter, so that he would not let the house thief go unpunished and suspect good people. Secondly, to take this opportunity to eliminate future troubles for Wang Yongtai, which is why he deliberately chose this date to come. It was rare that the dog-like couple were already in a clandestine meeting, so he could capture them both at once. As for this unexpected turn of events, Ran could not have foreseen it. Since I cannot dare to return the precious sword for the time being, that dog-like couple must not be let off lightly. Although I have no weapons in my hands, my fists alone are enough to deal with them. With this thought, Xu Jing immediately turned around, leaped back onto the wall, and walked silently to the front of He Ji's room. Peeking through the window, he saw Sang Yiqing and He Ji inside the mosquito net, moaning and groaning, seeking the pleasure of the Yang Terrace. Xu Jing's anger grew more intense, his rage escalated, and he used all his strength to push open the first window panel on the left. With a sound, the window fell to one side, and Xu Jing jumped into the room in one stride. Sang Yiqing, hearing the window noise from inside the net, poked his head out and saw Xu Jing standing upright in front of the net, his face full of anger. He couldn't help but cry out "Ah yo!" and shrink back into the net. Xu Jing shouted, "Dog thief! You are so bold as to engage in bestial acts behind the old man's back, do you have no humanity?" Sang Yiqing knew he was in a bad situation and, without time to dress, grabbed a pair of trousers and jumped out of the net naked, trying to escape. However, Xu Jing lifted his leg and kicked him, causing him to tumble and fall to the ground. Xu Jing went over, stepped on him with one foot, and sneered, "Tonight, your doomsday has arrived!" He snatched a waistband from him, tore it in two, and tied up his hands. Sang Yiqing was pleading, "Master Xu, I have no previous grudges with you. Please spare me. Please don't let the old man know, or else both my cousin and I will lose our lives. If you let us go, it will be a great act of kindness, and we will never forget your great virtue. We will enshrine your longevity tablet with incense and flowers, and our rebirth will be granted by you, Master Xu. If you are ever in need, my cousin will show her respect with gold, silver, and jewels, as long as you spare us tonight." Xu Jing ignored him and lifted the curtain with one hand, only to see He Ji covering her lower body with a large cloth, with nowhere to hide on the bed. (76)</p>

<h3>Li A Mao's Health Mailbox</h3>
<p>(Encountered a moralistic gentleman's question) On May 23rd, someone asked, "Is the recent appearance of small pustules on my face after having relations with a dancer related to this contact?" The reply was to have further contact. What is this all about? Isn't it too obscene?</p>
<p>(Answer) In general, the appearance of small pustules on the face of unmarried young men and women is a sign that the body is strong and there is a physiological need for marriage. The cure is simply to get married, and once married, the pustules will disappear. Many people suffer from this, and this mailbox has answered this question several times. Now, this person suspects that the small pustules are caused by having relations with a dancer, which is a big mistake. In fact, it is exactly the opposite. It shows that one encounter is not enough to prevent the appearance of pustules. Therefore, since a relationship has already occurred, it would be good to continue it. This is prescribing the right medicine for the ailment, so what's inappropriate about it? In short, your moralistic views are too deep. A medical perspective is different from an ordinary perspective. A medical perspective is above the waterline. What ordinary people consider obscene, medicine considers very ordinary. For example, when a woman gives birth, a doctor cannot refuse to examine her or deliver the baby because her actions when she conceived were obscene. Please take off your old-fashioned glasses.</p>
