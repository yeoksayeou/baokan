<p>社評</p>
<h3>美日和戰關頭</h3>
<p>適當日本特使來栖三郎飛美途中，美當局突於隔昨下令駐華海軍陸戰隊作迅速撤離的準備，這是去夏進行撤僑以來更進一步的露骨措施，並且與本月五日之撤退關島美民同樣表示着美政府的嚴重警戒態度。據說不久以前，日方曾向美提出此項要求，因此有人懷疑此舉之是否含有對日讓步意向，日方對此亦復有表示欣慰的論調。但是倘若拋開美方此一措置的偶合性質而從其對於遠東全盤與一貫的政策去觀察，更與兩日前美總統在勞工大會所發表的演說相印證，則加以懷疑者固未免悲觀，驟表欣慰者亦太嫌淺薄，如果已經美國的撤退遠束僑民並非綏靖日本，則此次之進一步的準備撤退駐軍也必不是對日本的讓步。</p>
<p>對於此一消息，首先自然是上海感到莫大悸動，一般都惴懷慮着美軍一旦撤離以後的安寗問題。誠然，年來美軍對於滬市維護之功極値得稱讚，而尤以英軍撤離之後負責更重貢獻最大；但是上海的地位和前途實決定於整個的現實國際關係，並非這不滿千名的軍士所盡可得而左右，假如太平洋風暴眞吿爆發，那時大家所應首先關切的是整個人類和文化的前途，一城一地的遭際，比較起來已不値得十分重視，而上海及其居民的安寗與福利，也只有在正義重張侵略匿跡之後繼能獲得眞正保障。是以此際的中心問題是動盪的速東大局，美軍的撤離與否不過等於時局的一具溫度表。假如局勢不到最後關頭，已在準備中的美軍撤退當不致驟付實施，美軍而眞竟撤離，那也就是說明了遠東大局的和平解決已全吿絕望。從近年往事來觀測美當局的舉措。其任何設施進退都必有充分有力的根據，斷不會輕妄從事的。</p>
<p>十一月十五日危機之說，日前曾極見聳動聽聞，而遠東大局之繼續向着惡化前途推移亦屬不可否認的事實；不過當此納粹攻蘇成效未可驟睹之際，遠東ABCD的聯合應變準備又復空前堅强，這絕不是滴於投機冒險的時機，稍具理智者當不難辨此，倘其眞竟悍然從事蠢動，則休戚之數亦早判然，自尋絕路的事大槪是任何人都要設法避免的。近頃美方對於繼續對日談話顯已無甚興趣，而日方則束條內閣旣於部署未定之際卽訓令野村若杉繼續進行折衝，最近又加派來栖趕赴美國，且傳携有日皇核准的方案，美國之於遠東正與其對於歐局一樣，始終保持着不挑戰不畏縮的一貫立塲，其間顯得焦急不耐且竭力試求作最後妥協者也判明並不是美國方面。於此足徵美國近數月來對於遠東所採取的堅强應變措施與經濟制裁手段，業已發生了初步效果。</p>
<p>但是主觀要求爲一事，客觀可能又爲一事，目前所見於事實者只是日本亟欲求美日關係的鬆弛於美方經濟壓力的減輕，却並未見其準備付出相當代價。七十餘日談話之一無成就，已足證明美國之不容干以非義，美方之堅持日軍退出中國與決不承認「大東亞共榮圈」，正是見其始終嚴守立塲，不事牽就，因此有如廣知時報所提七點建議之類，只能博得華盛頓方面的一哂，假如來　所携方案與此相類，則他的失敗早已決定在開始奉命登程之時，此行也證明爲多此一舉。然而另一方面，證以日方最近輿論之極形囂張，像前此齋藤陸夫尾崎行雄等人所發的儻言已不可復見，東條自身就任後亦曾一再聲言「旣定國策不可移易的決心」，則又不容想像來栖此行竟能提出為美國所接受的條件。以意度之，來栖此行，於日本的基本擴張政策大體殆無甚改變，其所恃以聳動美當局者當為關於三國公約的義務問題。世人如不健忘，當可憶及當美日從事談話之初，美方曾透露過希望日本脫離軸心的見解；事實上，日本從未就不曾有過斷然履行對德義務的決心，期間納粹曾一再誘引日本入　，但直到最近羅賓傑姆斯事件發生後，日方仍復保持模稜兩可態度，這大槪也就是來栖此度赴美最大期望所寄託，關於其他問題則希望美方讓步以為交換。然而從最近美方動態看來，其於所謂兩洋作戰問題已遠不如　昔顧忌之甚，武裝商船與駛入戰區之竟得在國會通過，更可見對於進一步的參戰問題亦有成竹在胸。最近美國朝野的關切程度，在遠東與歐局之間頗有新的消長，國會方面且表現着主張在遠東保持地位較竭力制止希特勒之決心更甚。則日方倘僅視擺脫三國盟約如環寶而欲以此打動美國，其必無成就殆可斷言。此度來栖赴美，美方反應空前冷淡，與前此之對待野村者頗異其趣，此一談判前途的展望，實不難於此觀之。</p>
<p>總而言之，來栖此行對於遠東大局之為禍為福，在目前仍然是一個未知數，不過惡化的可能却遠較好轉成分為高；而且此一談判，實具有最後和戰關頭的嚴重性質，則美國此際之向着最惡劣的前途去準備，實屬毫無足異，準備撤退駐華陸戰隊不過其中一端而已。久在茫茫長夜中的遠東，現在已將走進陰暗最甚的最後一段過程，但是對此實無所用其憂疑，因為繼之而至的也就是光明的破曉。</p>

<h3>美國撤軍聲中上海人的準備</h3>
<p>— 成仁</p>
<p>美總統羅期福已於前天向報界宣佈考慮撤退駐華軍隊，此間的美國海軍陸戰隊，據說也已奉到命令，準備立即撤退了。雖則「考慮」和「準備」，或許尙有文章。各方的猜測，也都認為此舉旨在加强對日談判時的地位，同時也在表示美國海軍準備作戰的決心。撒退駐華軍隊與美日大戰開始，其間或尙有一個相當的時距；夜長夢多，前途究將如何？目前未可立下斷語。然無論如何，日本若不停止侵華，美國即不辭戰。日本派來栖赴美，並申言於十一月十五日日本召開臨時議會前應作最後的決定；美國也就必需以撤退駐華軍隊，準備作可能立刻發生的大戰。如果說日本上項宣稱是一種神經戰，那未美國此舉，也可作為一種神經戰的答復。如果說日本確有蠻幹到底的胆量，此舉即表示美國已準備奉陪。如果報上所說來栖去美所携的談判內容，確如日前廣知報所列舉的那些；那末他勢必空勞往返。來　的空勞往返或成爲事實，是否就是遠東局勢已屆最後關頭？在此國際風雲千變萬化的現在，果也未可逆諸。尤其像日本常會以改組內閣，作為綏和緊張局面的手段。然則遠東前途，在此又多了一個註脚。那就是日本若不能以武力擊破ABCDR的聯合陣線，便非取消其「東亞共榮圈」的計劃不可。沒有人敢相信日本有這種把握，因此沒有人不相信此舉使中國更接近勝利了。然則中國國族越接近勝利，上海目前處境也就越惡劣。為了國族的前途與世界和平的降臨，上海的中外居民必也甘心接受這麽一個時代。然則在此時代尙未降臨而大有即將降臨的現在，上海的中外居民究應作何準備？實際一大問題。値此美國撤軍聲中，此一問題的解決，更覺其迫切了。</p>
<h3>六項準備</h3>
<p>講到準備，那眞千頭萬緒。扼要說來，下面幾點，非先準備不行。</p>
<p>準備提供自己的生命和勞力，以助「東亞新秩序一的建立。</p>
<p>日本僅僅對華作戰，已感兵源枯竭。如果日美戰起，蘇聯必將建立東西兩大戰塲。於是日本有三面作戰的必要。五百萬上海人中，被目為有「破壞東亞新秩序危險」的份子，罪重者斬，藉省一筆囚糧；罪輕者送入集中營給他做工。馴服份子，强壯者或送上戰錢充兵役或勞役，或驅入工廠給他做工。殘廢老弱者，如有節糧必耍時，可能來一個積極辦法，完成其减少人口的目的。</p>
<p>準備提供自己的財物，以助「東亞新秩序建設」的物資調整計劃之完成。物力是現代戰爭的要素，</p>
<p>日本正苦物資恐慌，本市租界內靠百億元的囤貨，在日本的作戰需要上果佔不了多大地位，畢竟也大可挹補一番。集中此項囤貨的方式有二：一是無條件徵發，一是按官價强制收買，房地產亦不能例外，鬥窗牆壁上的鋼骨，必要時也得來一偭徵發，像上屆歐戰時，德國住宅裏門窗上的任何銅鐵　品，一概拆去供鑄　軍火之用。可能在上海匕演一番。</p>
<p>準備繳出金銀等貴金屬作為贖罪留命的條件。</p>
<p>金銀等貴金屬，雖非軍需材料；，在太平洋大戰開始之日，日本對外買易也將全盤停頓，似乎也無集中金銀等貴金屬的必要。然而日本為了戰後的賠款支出，或戰後復興的需用，特別是為了戰後幣制整理上的需要，那末　集在今日上海租界區內的貴金屬，便非「收歸國有」不可，便非運往東京不可。如有匿藏不缴，則將命抵罪。</p>
<p>準備繳出工廠管理權，聽受「戰時工業生產管理法令」的支配。</p>
<p>此際一切生產，以適應日本作戰上的軍需為第一。然則今日上海的一切工業生產設備，其能配台日本此種需要者極少。因之凡能改裝而作軍需生產者，果可保留其機件；凡不能改裝為軍需作業的機件，便將全部拆卸，運往日本，投入鎔爐，改　為槍砲或其他機件</p>
<p>準備繳出商店管理權，聽受「戰時商業管理法令」的管理</p>
<p>日本要在上海建立其戰時經濟秩序，像今日如此這般的自由商業制度，自非根本改造不可。倉庫堆棧裏的囤貨，果應貼上封條，不得擅自搬移，違者嚴懲不貸。就是對於商店裏的存貨生財，也得全盤　報登記，合乎軍需的應先繳出，合乎民需的便得申請許可設才可交易。</p>
<p>準備呈騐銀錢業的賬簿冊據，並接受「戰時金融業管理法令」的管理</p>
<h3>整頓米市要策　裕民</h3>
<p>統一米售價　根絕自由市場實施統運統銷　確維公賣機構送貨一律禁止　運米先領派司</p>
<p>租界當局辦理港米小絞米的公賣，嘉惠平民，自是功德無量。然奸　從中漁利，流弊百出，報上載不勝載，局方也像防不勝防。為甚麼會弄到這副樣子？純因米市塲上另有港米小絞米的昂貴售價，才使奸宄之徒，利慾薰心；俗謂「只有千年做賊，沒有萬年防賊」。要消滅借公濟私，只有一個辦法：便是根本禁止港米小絞米的自由市塲，根本禁絕港米小絞米的自由價格。如果港米小絞米在上海市塲上，只有一個售價，那末營私舞弊的情事便不致發生，如果公賣售價之外，另有昂貴的自由市價，那未利令智昏之事，勢所難免。局方的嚴厲查禁，便至多只能做到「鞠躬盡瘁而已」了，結果仍將勞而無功。</p>
<p>租界當局辦理港米小絞米的運銷之初，聽說已採統運統銷制度，商人已無從挿足。要確保公賣機構的持久和穩固，原非實旅統運統銷不可。然則旣已實施統運統銷，那末港米小紋米的供給，顯已集中在當局之手：為甚麽現在米市塲上另有港米小絞米的昂貴售價發生？莫非統運統銷制度，尙未實施？</p>
<p>若確因尙米做到統運統銷的原則，那末就該根據這次的失敗經騐，立刻實行統運統銷的辦法。否則。。向港越定購時，既會遭到奸商的髙價爭購競爭，到上海發賣時，公賣價格之外也就免不了發生貴賤不同的另一種市價。如果另一種售價錢於公賣價，果不失為已收平抑米價之效，然於公賣政策的持久，顧在自取危機。如另一種售價竟能賣於公賣價，那末營私舞弊，勢難禁絕，因為局米和私米並無區別，大可魚目混珠，從中漁利。</p>
<p>港米小　米的公賣，原係一個穩定民食的德政，並非平　式的善舉。因為善舉，非有雄厚的財力爲後盾不可。試問增稅不遑之今日的租界財政，能否勝任愉快，何况事實上，今日的公賣資金，據說是取之於年初募集的公倉基金。這筆基金，性質上旣非公款，數量上叉極有限，作為善舉經費，殊非相宜。而且要做善舉，必須做得澈底；如果同仁輔元堂每年限收路屍一千具，此外即任其暴屍於市：那末他對於公共衛生的貢獻，便不能像今日無限制收屍時為大。租界當局旣有意為善，尤應善用這宗基金才行。</p>
<p>想到這次米風潮的開始，首由米號業髙掛「局米售罄」的紙牌而展開，繼而發生市塲上小　米等自由售價的暴漲。在比塲合，理應一方澈查市塲上小絞米的來源，另一方面應嚴辦米號家的隱匿不售與借公濟私。若是果係「局米售罄」，那就奇怪。因為旣有的款，運銷上的資金周轉，已無問題。若在初辦公賣時，或不免有靑黄不接的現象。此後就不該再有中斷的理由，除非經辦的未將出售所得的款項，立刻去續訂。或則平準會對於供應購米外滙措置，一時延宕。如係前者，誠盼當局一查米賬，以杜後患，如係後者，尤盼該會今接勿再犯舉棋不定的過失。</p>
<p>最後，凡看到今日公　情形的，誰都要感慨係之。人羣的鵠候街頭，荒時廢日，已屬寃枉之至，而鄰近商店居民之通道被阻，出入困難，營業無形停頓；尤屬寃枉。每當擠湧一起，鞭撻立下。而擠湧的發生，常由鄰近商店或居民的突圍而出所引起：因之店夥居民的受辱或挨打，勢所難免。此在維持秩序的巡警，旣已疲於奔命，現行辦法的不妥，由此也可以。想見何况鵠候終日而尙多不獲升斗者。</p>
<p>為什麼公賣時會弄到如此地步，一言以蔽之，蓋在防止承辦公賣號家的舞弊，與阻止有資者的鉅額購藏。而號家的舞弊與有資者的購囤，純受昂貴的市價所蠱惑。所以第一應根絕港米小絞米的自由市塲及其自由價格，第二便應根絕隱藏與囤積。要達到根絕隱藏與囤積，最簡易有效的辦法，莫如禁止米店向顧客的送貨。因為凡屬大宗交易，非送貨不可。號家旣向客家送貨，那就難保客家不多購多囤。</p>
<p>實施禁止送貨辦法，必須附以運米的給照辦法。凡米業中的搬運米糧，應先領取派司。沿路警捕，對於任何米車，均應查騐，如無派司，即予扣留·惟此項派司的發給，應具上列數條件，否則也難免不發生流弊的。</p>
<p>派司的效用，只限一次。須四聯式：一聯存局，一聯存起運站之崗捕，一聯存落貨站附近之崗捕，一聯由收貨號家於收貨後立即繳局。每天由局彙集各聯對銷之。</p>
<p>派司上應註明起迄地點，買賣商名，運輸路由，數量（每車一張，故每張數量不能超過一車容量之上），有效日期及時間，以及發行機關之印肥。</p>
<p>任何米車，均應領照，每次一張；而不限其為何種米。落貨站限於號家。凡屬新進口米糧入棧，則發給特別照會。</p>
<p>果能照此辦理，那末不僅囤藏局米的流弊可以防止，就是囤藏其他米糧的企圖，也難於遂願。上海米價的前途，庶幾有　。</p>
<p>編者註：運米離界，租界當局由昨天起，巳實施領取許可證辦法。但對界內的囤積活動，尙望採進一步辦法取綿，如本文所建議，値得注意。</p>
<p>銀錢業的賬簿冊據，非繳呈騐查，不足以明「重慶敵產」：同時亦不易明瞭上海今日的囤貨實况。而且為了便於利用上海人的人力起見，也得分別貧富，而後可以決定「免服軍役」的標準。因為凡有申請「免服軍役」者，其納「免役稅」應依其「納稅能力」為標準，方稱合乎「平等原則」。</p>
<h3>至於法幣</h3>
<p>至於上海的法幣，那倒未必會發生問題。因為牠雖則不能用以套購外匯，但尙可在鄰近游擊區套取物資。而且瞻望戰爭前送，卽在東京和南京，都無自信。為了日本戰後的幣制設想，保留僅有的金銀之外，尙有保有此項與金銀相同價値之法幣的必要。因為法幣已和國際金融權威的美金與英鎊聯繫，所以持有法幣，可以彌補存余存銀量之不足。所以很可能的，在今後日本銀行的紙幣發行準備中，利用法幣為牠的保證準備之一。即是南京方面有意推行新鈔，也有利用法幣為保證準備的必要。唯其如此，爭奪法幣的儲藏，或反出乎意外地演出，也未可知。</p>
<h3>至於糧食</h3>
<p>至於那時的糧食，大概也沒有問題，一因人口的疏散，一因囤貨的出籠，一因上海已成日本的「兵站」與「後方的重鎭」，再則日本將盡其可能，把中國沿海連越南拉在一起，構成一個「東亞共榮圈」而「調整一切」。但是要享受那時的便宜米，應先作前述六項的準備。申言之：非把自己的生命和財物繳出，那就無權享受。然則繳出了自己的生命和財物，也就斷送了戰後的生命與財物。苟安一時呢？還是為更多的未來生活設想呢？那就看各人的自　了。</p>
<h3>美駐軍撤退後　上海經濟地位如</h3>
<p>— 何梁溪</p>
<p>雖則烽烟四起，居留在上海的中外人民，却因當地的情形特殊，偏安一隅，而獨享「繁榮」。然而物極必反，盛極必衰。據合眾社八日華盛頓急電，美國駐華海軍陸戰隊已奉命令，準備立即撤退。誠以美日一且開戰，美國駐華海軍陸戰隊就絕對沒有在華逗留的必耍，同時美國的僑民也就沒有再事留戀的道理。</p>
<p>美國駐華海軍陸戰隊果眞撤退，上海的經濟地位，必然因此成為問題。</p>
<p>首從資金方面說：上海鉅大數字的一筆游資，識者早為担憂着，可是言者諄諄，而聽者藐。擁有大量游資的人們，只把它用在投機上面，以求暴利。而新近銀行錢莊和銀號的開設，竟如雨後春筍；立脚未穩，就將遭此大變，前途危險，可想而知。如果金融界一有變動，結果不免造成動一髪而牽全身的局面。</p>
<p>再從商品方面說：商品怎樣呢？也許有人以為囤貨，因有眞貨在手，不怕什麽。然而皮之不存，毛將焉附，囤貨也是不會安全的，而將遭受更不利的厄運．到了某方對上海無利用或享用的時候，勢必採取殺雞的手段。說得明白些，某方必以武力控制一切存貨與生產機關；再來一下「調整勅令」，以為「調整本市物資的供需」，結果所至，家倉變成公倉，要吃用自己的囤糧和儲貨，也得向某方當局請領「許可證」。至於一般倉庫堆棧裏的存貨，更不消說了，客氣一點，是以雜鈔按「官價」強制收買；不客氣呢，來個沒收充公，並嚴申「　藏者死」。一般人囤貨莫非爲的是自己吃用，或藉此發「財」，囤貨旣不能自己食用，又不能待善價而沽，反而懷貨者有罪，眞是何苦！奉勸囤貨諸君，與其將來受苦落空，不如趕早脫手，樂得現惠；並將其所得，投諸大後方正當事業　，藉作彼本人生活之保障</p>
<p>隨着上述兩種可能後果的產生，上海的人民和資金，勢將逃散，那時的上海，正是死港荒島，　配稱「鼓搗」。但是我們用不着憂懼，因為美國的堅決立塲，早日見諸行動，則遠東局勢亦可早日澄清。黎明的前一剎那，共黑暗更甚。所以，暫時的困苦，應當忍受而克服之，那末，苦盡甘來，當不在遠了。</p>

<p>徐家匯天文臺昨日午後四時三十分氣象預報云、山東四　天晴頗凉、有勁峭之北風、此間與馬鞍島以南沿海由晴轉　、頗冷、有從和緩而轉勁　之北至柬風、又昨日午後三前二十四小內、本埠氣溫最高七三。○、最低五五·四、去年同日最高六〇·一、最低四二·四、</p>
<p>先說電燈</p>
<p>螢光燈為近代科學界之一有趣發明、且以其甚合經濟原則、頗切實用、故銷路頗廣、惟以其所屬公司爲欲專利計、輒不顧將其構造公諸大眾、故頗値研究、吾人茲先就電燈言之、電燈分有絲無絲兩種、有絲電燈係利用電流通過一電阻、由發熱而發光、此項電燈首先發明者爲愛迪生、　於一八七九年以縫衣之綫、經過科學方法煉製後、用做燈絲、但其性質過於脆弱、極易燒斷、故成績欠佳、經數度改進、易用金屬後、迨至一九〇七年、始知應用鎢絲、一九一一年益見進步、乃將鎢絲拉成細絲、裝於燈內、此種燈絲不易損壞至燈泡中則係眞空、因茍有空氣儲存其間、則電燈發光、即起氧化作用、燈絲於頃刻間損壞矣、迨至一九一三年經屢度改進後、乃知燈泡內可　若干性質穩定之氣體、使成相當真空、名之爲　氣鎢絲燈、此燈所容納電力瓦特數較前者爲多、今日所用之有絲燈亦即屬此種、</p>
<p>無絲電燈</p>
<p>有絲燈之進步固極迅速然另一方面無絲電燈之進展、耍亦未可輕視、無絲電燈之發光、係應用放電作用、即陰極放出　子、與某種相當氣體相逢時、電子　散氣體之原子後、叉反複還原、由是成激動狀態、在此狀態中、氣體遂發光輝、當十五世紀時、此項硏究、即頗風行、迨至一八九三年有　爾（More）比者、首先對此有所貢獻、一、九〇四年”在美國、照上述原理、製成電燈、一九一○年英人克洛氏利用氖、氬等氣體、製成無絲燈、亦即令日市上所見之霓紅燈、至其所呈現之顏色、視燈內所貯氣體而各異、如所貯者為氖則色紅、爲氬則色黄、所　螢光燈、與上述者屬於一類、所異者、上述氣體燈、係由氣體直接發光、而螢光燈　係屬間接也、</p>
<p>早已有之</p>
<p>實則螢光燈之發明、遠在一八六六年即已有之、惟僅屬初步而已迨至一九三三年、美國某電氣公司、於硏究之後、個成功之螢光燈、以成績頗佳、管、兩端置燈絲、（但此燈絲並非用於發光）、兩端俱屬陰極、蓋交流電源之正負兩極係相互交流、並不固定、故該燈之兩端、均可吸收交流電源之陰電子、此外該玻璃管內並置有氣體水銀管之裏面、且塗有化學粉　、此粉　之成分、因專利者嚴加守秘、刻下尙待研究、又該燈尙有三大重要部份、即整流器觸發器、容電器是也、裘氏對於螢光燈物理部分、化學部分、工程部分、機械部分、逐一解釋、叙述至詳、惜黑板反光、板上所書各項名詞、聽眾多無法窺見、至於螢光燈之光與眞正太陽光、並不完全相同、其差異之處頗多、據試騐所得、七月間無雲晴天之太陽光、其光譜包含各項色素、與螢光燈不同、最顯著者、螢光燈所含藍色太多、紅色太少、故市上所見之螢光燈、較之日光、終有差異、又現今之螢光燈、常有閃光、對眼睛衛生、頗有影響、要之、螢光燈實尙有待吾人之加緊研究、力加改進也、</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>因徐案聯想到　改良家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>最近發生的徐案，使社會震驚，一般人對於該案的發展，非常關切，一切經過，另有記載，不涉本刊範圍，自不必再加論列。但以家庭立塲而論，從積極的謀進步，俾使一般家庭都能有合理而優美的生活起見，特就結婚的重耍，丈夫的責任，母敎的可貴，和金錢的眞正價値四點，與讀者作如下的討論。</p>
<p>家庭對於我們每一個人關係的密切，母庸多說，因為無論天南地北，貧賤富貴，誰都有一個家，我們一生的時間，至少有三分之二是在家中過去的，然而許多人偏不去為自己三分之二的生命打算，使人生吏有意義，豈不可惜。</p>
<p>固然，在我們的幼年，在父母撫育之下，說不到什麽改良家庭，但當達到結婚的年齡時，就應該對於自己一生的重要部份加以考慮了。</p>
<p>結婚本來是一種藝術，易卜生會經說過，結婚的成功，是基於相互的眞誠，自由和智慧上的。當一個人踏上結婚的禮壇時，他就對於社會，負起了極大的責任，他得檢討他從自己的父母那裹，遺傳得到了那幾種優美的性格，而自己有沒有特殊的長處，將來能毅遺傳給自己的兒女而使他們成為有用的人才。有許多名垂千古的偉人和文學家科學家，都會從他們的父親或是母親那裏，獲得了優美的性格。</p>
<p>做丈夫的往往要說，他們為着經濟間題，不得不專心一致地在事業上努力，這種見解，自然未可厚非，然而人生的責任，並不止於解決經濟問題，用自己的勞力和精神，去換取適當的代價，這是做事，也是人人會做而能做的事，未必有過於社會，但也不能說是有功。他們必須以相當的精神，去使家庭組織得健全合理，樣是做人，這做人的程度，就能　分出高下而確定一個人的人格。我們先得知道怎樣做人，然後方能談到怎樣做事，專為金錢着想而做事，不為社會着想而做人，我們就要虛此一生了。</p>
<p>自然啦，做妻子的具有同樣的責任，生養兒女，那是每一種生物都能　做的事，即使最卑賤的東西，也會得產生他們的後代，然而人類所以不同，就是要生而能敎，養而能育。安迪生如果沒有他的母親，也許會成為一個流浪街頭的頑童，羅斯福總統得到他母親的敎養，成為舉世屬目的人物，然而他的母親並不會希望他升官發財，只希望他成為一個優秀的公民。所以安迪生的母親是光榮，羅斯福總統的母親是快樂的。</p>
<p>中國本來是一個重視母敎的國家，孟母，岳母以及歐陽修的母親的故事，差不多是每一個人所知道的，即使看看京戲和地方戲，也可以看到許多關於敎子的戲。敎子自然不是一件容易的事，兒童敎育，本來也是一種科學，而市上關於講述兒童敎育的書籍不能說少，費幾角錢就可以買到，然而懶於敎養的父母，仍舊很多，結果破壞自己的家庭，影響社會的進步。其實我們把自己的子女敎養成社會的棟樑，雖只盡了自己的本份，如能更進一步而為社會造就多數的幹才，纔能說是替社會做了一個實際的服務。美國弗萊納根神父，創設孤兒樂園，愛娜葛萊台夫人，創辦兒童保育所，用着堅強的毅力，始終不懈地在實幹，令人可敬。</p>
<p>一個人要有可貴的智慧，先得有充分的學識，但學識是隨時可以求取的，歐美不乏白手起家的企業家，他們到了相當時期，就設法充實自己，因此就能發做齊，寫文章，作精彩的演講，出入於學者之門。所以他們有一句話，就是·「人生肇始於四十歲」。因為到了四十歲，已經具有充分的人生經騐，以前的錯誤，可以加以改革，要求社會做一點有益的事，這就是一個黄金時代。已經富有的人，可以想到貧苦的人而施散他們的財富，這樣就能　明白金錢的眞正價値，而他們的精神，將是快樂而安愉的。</p>
<p>一般的家庭，往往問題重重，但如果不去改良，那末過了十年，還是同樣的問題重重，為我們自身的幸福，為我們國族的煎途起見，我們不禁要大聲疾呼地請每一個人注意家庭生活的改良問題。</p>
<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3>徵文揭曉之六　拖油瓶</h3>
<p>— 鴕</p>
<p>「拖油瓶一是一個滿含着辣性的名字，因着這個名字的產生，所以在我的家庭裏就有一種說不出的苦難存在着。</p>
<p>我的媽和那個爸，（就是後來的）他們時常口角，而結果，伊總是被壓下的，伊唯一的希望便是望著我，一聲不響地望着我，好像在我的週身要找出些什麽來似的。有一次我獨自一個人站在窗前，看着五六隻鴿子在一塊兒遊戲，忽然在我的後腦感到一陣溫暖，我回過頭去一看，原來是媽，她正在靜靜地望着我出神。所以當我回過頭去一看，我們的視綫又接觸着了，我雖不說一句話，但是在我的內心是非常明白的。媽總是默默地向我呆望，我怕她道樣做，因為我知道她這樣作時又在想着我已故的爸爸了。</p>
<p>現在我一天天地長大起來，我知道羞恥，我怕見人，因為我是一個拖油瓶，有時客人見了我，就對那個爸說：「老兄，你的福眞不淺，兒子也這樣大了」，這時他微微應諾而已，而這時的我眞不堪設想，可謂上天無路，入地無門的難堪，但如此以外又可怎樣呢？我知道我心裏的沉痛，道是普通一般人所不能了解的。我很怕和他聚在一起，即使在一起也不常談笑，我簡直連頭都不願抬起來見他，我相信他也知道我的，我更相信他所以對媽常常爭吵的緣故，或許都是為了我，雖有時是因為刖的緣故，但是因此他可以借題發揮了。寫到這裏，我的淚直向心弦中送，因為我實在對不起媽，她因着不願拋棄我，因着我的生命與以後的生活，所以她忍着一切的苦痛，忍着一切的辱駡，才實行另嫁，而嫁後又暗暗備我流淚，為我嘆息，自己又如牛馬一般的被人指揮，還加上社會上許多人將她當作淫婦一般地輕視她，欺侮她……哦，我不能再寫，因為我的心如一個病者正在離世一瞬間，那麽地感到痛苦，我的手在發抖，頭也漸漸地昏了，我忍不住了，我需要休息一會。（酬稿費十元家庭月刋全年）</p>
<p>編者按鴕君的苦衷，</p>
<p>我很同情他，然而在這樣一個新時代裏，決不容拖油瓶這個名詞存在了。鴕君旣然知道母親的苦處，就應　努力謀進步，決不該顯出颓唐的態度。將來能够在社會上有偉大的貢獻的時候，那一個人再會來說你是以個拖油瓶呢。</p>
<p>一般人對於無父無母的孤兒，也具有輕視的態度，然而美國的英雄安德露傑克遜是一個孤兒，從前英國的首相勞合喬治也是一個孤兒。</p>
<p>每一個人誕生到這個世界上來，他就是屬於全人類的，他是人類的一份子，他應該享受人類應享的權利，他也應該盡人類應盡的義務，希望鴕君記住這幾句詁。</p>

<p>上星期說起抄蟹粉東西果然是筆者所愛吃的，可是單純的，炒蟹粉，總覺得貴族化以些，為了經濟關係，不得不打打算盤。要吃蟹粉，又要打算盤；自然必須在輔佐品上着想。比較經濟些的還是加些豆腐在內，做一個蟹粉豆腐羹。此外如蟹粉炒靑菜，蟹粉炒綫粉，蟹粉炒薺菜，都比軍純的炒蟹粉要經濟不少，而風味亦自不惡。不過炒時少不了猪油，炒綫粉尤其需要較多的猪油，　覺腴美可口，這是，不能省的。</p>

<h3>願大家反省一下</h3>
<p>— 無為</p>
<p>工董明思德氏未去滬前，筆者曾和他談道上海的食糧及物價管制問題。講到米價的上漲靡已，明先生喟然而嘆，頗有不勝其扼腕的樣子。他說：要求各種困難的解決，一定耍市民起來，大家和局方合作。</p>
<p>操縱居奇，濫抬物價的商人，我們暫且不談。現在且願大家平心靜氣的自我檢舉一下：直接和間接的，有沒有「助成」物價的漲勢。</p>
<p>當然，一個人多買一包火柴，或多購三塊肥皂，似乎對於整個的上海物價，不會發生嚴重問題。但是大家要知道，我們過的是社會集體生活，一而十，十而百，而千，而萬，而百萬……怎樣不會叫偌大的一個上海，發生重大變化呢？</p>
<p>一般「外行」商人－指並不營經商者－把各種貨物，用各種方法囤積起來，以求善價而沽。他們的心理，以為大家在做這件事，為什麽單單我做不得；別人能賺錢，為何我獨是例外；於是，不問資金多寡，但求市上貨還未斷，總覺得無限的希望，就在眼前了。</p>
<p>願大家自己反省一下：我雖無法抑止物價的，使其平穩；可是我多少有沒有「助成」物價的上漲呢？</p>
<h3>開米店專辦平糶</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>茲有一事，敬向先生請敎。</p>
<p>日來滬市金融紊亂，百物奇昂，柴米油鹽，日漲夜大。一般貧苦之升斗小民，或中下之薪水階級，無不叫苦連天，望洋興嘆。鄙人目擊心傷，補救無術，苦思焦應，至廢寢餐。茲本救己救人之義，作身體力行之　。擬邀知己數人，集款三千元，開一小小米店，專向工部局購買平　米，憑門市限價出賣與升斗平民。惟鄙人素無商業知識，此事是否可行，殊無把握，為此敬向先生請敎下列五事：</p>
<p>（一）專賣平米，是否可以維持日用，及門面，伙食等開支？</p>
<p>（二）領開米店執照，要經過何種手續？</p>
<p>（三）資本三千元，是否足敷？</p>
<p>（四）購平米，工部局是否可以供給無缺？</p>
<p>（五）向工部局購米，要經過一些什麽手續？敬祝撰安！熊鋤辛頓首編者答：</p>
<p>（一）賣平米，有手續費可賺。（每石約法幣十元左右）。</p>
<p>（二）同普通營業執照。</p>
<p>（三）資本三千，嫌少。因一切店基生財，目前置辦非輕。</p>
<p>（四）可以供給無缺。</p>
<p>（五）已經登記者可以向當局請求。（由四川路外灘立基洋行辦理）申請核准後付款（劃頭）領米。察足下之意，實以服務為主，不妨一詢當局，接洽目前「平米出售處」或更適合之事務如何？</p>
<h3>再談哈同</h3>
<p>— 益凡</p>
<p>最近上海社會受人注意的事要算羅迦陵女士死後哈同遺產的發落了。一個八萬萬元的數目不是小的！除哈同夫婦的嗣子女要求遺產權外，並帶「紅」了很多人的「眼」。這一局遺產繼承之訟，我們很可以看下去。</p>
<p>哈同是英國籍猶太人。猶太人有經商聚財的特技！猶太人刻苦精神，普通地說來很可佩服。但其人生態度還有加勉的必要。</p>
<p>我們經過一條長長地靜安寺路時，幾乎完全踏在哈同的產業上。公共租界市民納稅維持的警力的一部份！即在靜安寺路之警備－幾乎完全為保護哈同私產而設，依情理來說在靜安寺路一帶的擊備，應由哈同負担。但工部局無從達此目的，祇分攤之而已。有人說在靜安寺路西段仍有鄕村式房屋而不繫榮者，因哈同深恐增加納稅義務之故也。數年前工部局曾商之哈同夫人，為改善南京路河南路十字路口之交通而欲購哈同之地，結果以哈同要求太苛而罷，凡我上海人士路過該處者，不難嘗到該處交通滋味如何。五次大戰，工部局特請哈同捐助紅千字曾。哈同</p>
<p>哈同生前無大貢獻於上海，而上海則會為哈同之發祥地並樂園也。哈同猶人，已死矣。哈同嗣子女則猶在也，其將何以善其後歟？</p>

<p>照他自己想，反正這一次進紅舞台去錢若默已知照蕭吉淸不要說起自己從前的事，後台祇用一個呉三喜的假名，到得出台的時候，臉、上總得抹彩，無論記心怎樣好，眼力怎樣尖的看客，也決不會想到自己就是秋海棠。這樣在面子的一點上，是不成問題了！再說第二件體力問題。他記得從前也有好幾個師弟兄因為搭不到班子，漸漸淪為武行，看他們樣子，也並不怎樣累；，一天至多有兩　武戲而且並不是每一齣武戲裏都要大開打，有時候僅僅扎幾鎗，使幾刀便算了，自己的功夫雖然已荒了幾年，不見得連道一些也對付不了。無所表示。臨行贈紅會五十銀元而已。</p>
<p>可是第二天晚上，他上紅舞台一試，便險些累得速走回家來的力氣也沒有。</p>
<p>因為是第一天上台，他當然格外巴結，在六點五十分的時候便趕到後台了。那個武管事的見了他也非常客氣，而且因為隔夜蕭吉淸已特別囑咐過的綠故，還親自領着他在後台兜了一個圈子，所有管事的人和班底裏的一班二三路角色，也替他逐一引見。（二五八）</p>

<h3>Headquarters Conference of War Zones in China Discusses Plans to Defend the Yunnan-Burma Road; British Military Defenses Reinforced at the Burma-Thailand-Vietnam Border; Elite Central Army Troops Stationed at the Yunnan-Vietnam Border</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - According to sources in Chongqing, in light of the increasingly tense international situation, Chairman Chiang convened an emergency meeting of the commanders of various war zones on Wednesday and Thursday. This was earlier than the originally scheduled meeting in mid-November. It is said that the defense of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the import of raw materials, and military cooperation with various countries were the main topics of discussion at this meeting. After the meeting, General Shang Zhen and Minister of Interior Zhou Zhongyue flew to Kunming to assist General Long Yun in planning how to defend the Yunnan-Burma Highway. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi - A special correspondent for Reuters, who had traveled by car from Kunming to the Vietnamese border of China, has recently returned. He told people that he could solemnly declare that there were no extraordinary Japanese military activities in the area he passed through. He was impressed by the difficult terrain of the area and considered it suitable for defense. The entire border area has towering cliffs, densely forested mountains, and narrow valleys and passes, which will become a paradise for guerrillas in the event of war. According to reliable sources, the Chinese side has a very strong central government force stationed along the border, commanded by officers and soldiers who participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang. (Reuters, 9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rangoon - According to military special correspondents, since 1939, Burma's defenses have been gradually and carefully increased to meet the needs of the ever-changing international situation. This is not speculation, but reality. Although there is still room for various efforts in all aspects of national defense preparations, especially air defense and other emergency training, Burma's planned defense forces today are non-existent since 1939, and this strength is increasing every week. The outbreak of war has made Burma the focus of global attention. The reason for this is the opening of the unparalleled Yunnan-Burma Road. The Yunnan-Burma Road is the lifeline for China to receive military assistance from Europe and the United States. However, Burma's equipment in the eastern triangle defense of the empire, including Hong Kong, Malaya and Burma, was inferior until the Commander-in-Chief of Burma was promoted to Lieutenant General in early 1940, and the defense situation changed dramatically. This move put the Burmese army on an equal footing with the Malayan army. In order to adapt to Burma's defense needs and the possibility of direct attacks on the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain dispatched more British-Indian troops to strengthen Burma's defenses, and built heavily armed outposts on the 900-mile border between Burma and Vietnam and Thailand. At the same time, it established resistance against attacks from the sea and air, and prohibited foreigners from living and traveling in certain special areas. More modern weapons and the latest mechanical vehicles and equipment began to arrive. Air defense matters began in Burma under the command of European deputy commanders. The Royal Air Force also arrived and stepped up the mobilization of the Burmese Rifle Corps, the Mechanical Corps, etc. The Burmese people are enthusiastically participating in national defense work. When Burma's strength is enhanced, the important export for the empire's wartime efforts will not be affected. At the same time, a large number of leased goods transported to China from the United States via land or highways, such as armaments, munitions, aircraft and other war equipment, will not be affected. On this busy road, China transports important tung oil, mineral seedlings and other raw materials to American arms factories. China relies on this road to establish new export trade and economically assist it in continuing its strong war with the invaders. (Reuters, 9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Newspapers here continue to demand that Japan attack Yunnan Province and the Yunnan-Burma Road in order to cut off American aid to China. (United Press, 9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Zhongmu Area</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military sources report that the Japanese troops who retreated to a corner of the old Yellow River iron bridge and the city of Zhongmu have been continuously attacked fiercely by the Chinese army and are in a state of disarray. They were reinforced by a unit from the opposite bank, and under the cover of machine guns and cannons, they launched a counterattack against the Chinese army, but were severely beaten by the Chinese army and failed to succeed. The battle continues in the original battlefield. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese military sources recently stated that the entire Chinese front is currently generally quiet, with fighting only occurring in Henan Province, where the Chinese army has penetrated deeply into Zhongmu, which is occupied by the Japanese army. It also stated that the Chinese army has driven the Japanese army to Xinyang. (United Press, 9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northwest China of Xinjiang Recaptures a Stronghold</h3>
<p>Xingji - The Japanese troops entrenched in Gudui (northwest of Xinjiang) have suffered heavy casualties after continuous and fierce attacks by the Chinese army in recent days. On the evening of the 5th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the village and launched another fierce attack on the Japanese army. After fierce fighting until 10 pm, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated to the city of Xinjiang. The Chinese army then recaptured Gudui. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attacking Xiangshan Repelled by Chinese Army</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military sources report that about 1,000 Japanese troops from Shipu and other places in eastern Zhejiang Province harassed Fangjiaqiao (west of Xiangshan) via Maoyang on the 5th. They were repelled by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 6th, the Japanese troops attacked Xiangshan City via Nanbu and were intercepted by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Panjiaqiao, killing and wounding over 100 of them. The Japanese troops retreated in defeat. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation Report from October 31 to November 6</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Commission said that last week he talked about the Japanese army in Shanxi and Vietnam simultaneously gathering troops, appearing as if they were launching attacks from both the north and south at the same time. Subsequently, the attack was launched first in Shanxi, because the Donglongmen Mountain, which shields the ferry crossing of the Yellow River, has been maintained by the Chinese army from last week to today. Therefore, the "attempt to sweep through the Lüliang Mountains" was not realized. On the Vietnamese side, the Japanese army is still transferring troops and actively deploying. In this dull space, the news of the defeat of the Japanese army in the Zhengzhou area suddenly came. The Japanese army in Zhengzhou was originally launched to contain the various Chinese troops in northern Hunan, and the fundamental operation has ended. Due to the unfavorable terrain of being backed by water, and the continuous attacks by the Chinese army since its occupation, the Japanese army retreated in defeat on the night of the 31st, and also declared an "automatic retreat." Unexpectedly, in recent days, the wind and waves on the Yellow River have been strong, and the wharf has collapsed, making it impossible to cross. It is currently being surrounded by the Chinese army in the area near Qiaonanpu and Zhongmu. Although the Japanese army launched small-scale battles in southern Henan to play a containment role, I am afraid that it will not be able to relieve the siege on the south bank of the Yellow River. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Since November 2nd, the Japanese troops who crossed the old and new Yellow Rivers to invade Zhongmu, Zhengzhou and the old Rongze County have repeatedly launched attacks on nearby areas, but were repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army also continuously attacked the Japanese troops invading these areas, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. On the morning of the 31st, the Japanese army gathered more than 10,000 troops to make a final struggle, and launched a fierce attack on the line from Zhangzhuang Street, 38 miles south, to Hehuanggang Temple, Xushui Town, to the Foshan and to Hanwangcheng in separate directions. The Chinese army fought bravely against the attacking Japanese army, and after fierce fighting until 10 pm, the attacking Japanese troops retreated in defeat. The Japanese army in Zhengzhou was also forced to retreat towards Jingshui Town. The Chinese army then advanced in separate directions, one route recovering the city of Zhengzhou at 12 pm that night, one route approaching the suburbs of Zhongmu City before dawn on the 1st, and one route attacking towards Jingshui. They captured Pipa Chen, Xiaoxin Village, Dahe Village and other areas. By dawn on the 3rd, they killed and wounded hundreds of Japanese troops. The Japanese army retreated west to Dongzhao Village, and the Chinese army completely recovered Jingshui Town and continued to capture Dongzhao Village at 2 pm, killing and wounding more than 300 Japanese troops. The rest retreated towards the old Yellow River. One unit was surrounded by the Chinese army in the river bank area northwest of Dongzhao Village. After a fierce attack until the evening, most of the Japanese army was eliminated, and the remaining small unit could not escape and fell into the Yellow River, where they were shot and killed by the Chinese army in the river. The other unit south of the Yellow River iron bridge is still entrenched on the line from Rongze County to Bawangcheng, stubbornly resisting. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, the old Rongze County was completely recovered at 3 pm on the 2nd. At the same time, strongholds such as Fanhezhai and Bawangcheng were also captured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army retreated to the vicinity of the Yellow River iron bridge. However, due to the strong wind and waves in recent days and the collapse of the wharf, heavy weapons could not be transported north. Therefore, most of the Japanese troops were suppressed by the Chinese army in the area on the banks of the new and old Yellow Rivers. The Chinese troops are advancing fiercely towards the Japanese army in a pocket-shaped formation and have already surrounded the Japanese army separately. The Japanese army has run out of food and ammunition and is only being supplied by aircraft. The Chinese army is currently striving to tighten the encirclement and launch an all-out attack on the Japanese army. It will not be difficult to eliminate them all.</p>
<p>In order to contain the pursuing troops of the Chinese army in the Zhengzhou area, the Japanese army ordered more than 3,000 Japanese troops from Yanghezhen, northeast of Xinyang, to attack north on the morning of the 1st. After invading Tugou, they split into two units. One unit invaded Zhengyang at noon and continued to increase to more than 3,000, continuing to attack north and invading Runan to Balipu at noon. Reinforcements continued to arrive. A unit was divided into two units again on the morning of the 4th, one unit to Shangcai and one unit to Shaocheng. The Chinese army fought bravely to meet them in separate directions, defeating the Japanese army and killing and wounding many Japanese troops. The rest retreated to Runan, and the Chinese army is pursuing them. The other unit that harassed Dushansi also increased to more than 1,500 and invaded Zhumadian at 5 pm on the 4th. The Chinese army is bravely resisting them, but they are already in a state of disarray and will also retreat. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Undemarcated Section of Northern Yunnan-Burma Border to be Surveyed Starting Next New Year’s Day; Chinese Side Appoints Yin Mingde as Boundary Commissioner; Demarcated Southern Section Will also be Marked Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Kunming - The Sino-British Yunnan-Burma southern border line has been finalized through an exchange of notes in Chongqing this summer.

<h3>MacDougall Discusses Impressions of Travel in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Director of Information MacDougall recently visited the wartime capital for a week or two and returned here last night. He said that he had a much better impression of the general situation in the capital.

Although most of the rebuilt houses are temporary structures, the speed is truly amazing. He also mentioned that he had talks with Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Minister Wang Shijie and other government leaders. He was moved by the firm optimism of the Chinese government leaders.

<h3>Guizhou Actively Developing Water Conservancy Projects</h3>
<p>Guiyang - The work on farmland water conservancy in Guizhou Province is currently proceeding very intensely. The Lianjiang irrigation project in Huishui, which has taken more than a year, has been surveyed and completed. After its success in the future, it can irrigate more than 30,000 mu. In addition, the Mengguan irrigation project in Huishui has already started. As for Zhongcaosi in Guizhu County, with thousands of mu of fields, there are plans to divert the water from the Youmin River for irrigation. Caohai in Ziyun County, which spans more than 30 li, has also sent personnel to survey it, in order to turn this large wasteland into fertile farmland. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Jiangsu, Shandong and Henan Actively Eradicate Opium Seedlings; Internal Reports on Achievements to be Copied and Sent to the External Affairs Ministry to be Translated and Forwarded to the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on Narcotics</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to related reports, the Japanese are using various methods in provinces such as Shanxi, Suiyuan, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Jiangxi to implement their toxicification policy. The details of each situation are described below. The Japanese in Taiyuan recently sent personnel to Ning County to investigate opium seedlings and stipulated that the entire county should plant 3,000 mu of opium. Those who exceed the regulation will be levied 11-12 liang of opium and 10 yuan of miscellaneous bills per mu. The Japanese army in Jie County recently re-manufactured heroin by secretly infiltrating toxins, making it even more poisonous. Initially, it was found that yellow water would flow from the nose after the first inhalation, and red water would flow from the urine after three days of continuous inhalation. The Japanese army in Suiyuan forced the people to plant opium, and the area was extremely wide. They recruited poor people from Shenshui, Fugou in northern Shaanxi, and Hequ in northwestern Shanxi to harvest it. The Japanese army in Jiangsu and Shandong forced the people to plant poppies in their occupied areas, and offenders would be punished. The Japanese army in Xinjian, Jiangxi, ordered the people to plant opium seedlings and sent people to manufacture opium in the residences of the people in Hucun, implementing a toxicification policy in every possible way. In order to comply with anti-narcotics regulations and break the Japanese toxicification policy, our government has instructed all units under the various war zones, as well as economic guerrillas, to go deep into the Japanese-occupied areas and do their best to eradicate them. According to a recent report from the Jiangsu-Shandong war zone, a certain division eradicated 439 mu, 3 fen and 5 li of opium seedlings in Juxian, Anqiu, Zhucheng, and Linguan counties. Another division eradicated 83 mu, 3 fen and 4 li in Mengyin area, and 234 mu and 9 fen in ×× county area. The ××× column eradicated 132 mu and 2 fen in Rizhao, Juxian, and Zhucheng counties.</p>

<h3>Panda Presentation Ceremony Held in Chongqing Yesterday Morning; Madame Chiang and Madame Kung Broadcast to the United States; Graham Reports on the Capture Process</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Before 4 am today, Madame Chiang and Madame Kung braved the rain to go to the radio station to formally present two pandas to the United China Relief and the New York Zoological Society and broadcast a brief message to the United States. One of the pandas was accepted by Mr. Teevan, a member of the Zoological Society, on behalf of the society and the United China Relief, and will soon be taken back to New York. Dr. Graham, who came from Chengdu and directed the capture of the pandas in the mountains of western Sichuan, and Mr. Teevan both reported on the capture of the pandas and the preparations for taking them to the United States. In her presentation speech, Madame Kung broadcast to the United States, "These two pandas are so lovely. Madame Chiang and I hope that in the future, we will be able to offer your country even more gifts comparable to these two rare animals. We are presenting this gift to express our friendship with your country and our gratitude to the United China Relief for relieving China." Madame Kung also said that she felt that giving pandas to the United States was more appropriate than other gifts. First, because pandas are unique to China and are not found anywhere else in the world; second, because pandas are rare animals, and only seven have been given by China to date; and third, because we want to give a pleasant gift, because we have been through the worries of war and deeply feel that giving this gift is our time to seek happiness in bitterness. She also said that pandas are produced in the far west of China, which is enough to symbolize the situation of 400 million Chinese people moving from the coastal areas to the west. In her speech, Madame Chiang said that your association has given us so much, such as medicines and supplies, that it is impossible to list them all. The wounded soldiers in our country all know that the medicines and other supplies are donated by your association. Our soldiers all feel that friends overseas have taken the time and effort to care for these unfortunate friends. Madame Chiang also described the fact that the Chinese people were forced to use various items, such as bamboo tubes, as substitutes for medical supplies, and to convert scrap iron and broken shrapnel into surgical instruments. She also said, "However, we cannot replace microscopes, X-ray machines and many other medical necessities with other items. We have to rely on foreign countries for these items." Madame Chiang also said that she visited orphanages and saw that when many young children mentioned the United States, their eyes and expressions showed special attention. They all knew that American children were saving money and raising funds to help Chinese children. Madame Chiang also said that the United States is by no means like a Fascist country that enjoys harming the weak. The United States' support for justice and humanity is the same as China's, which has been fighting hard for more than four years to maintain justice and humanity. I believe that the friendship between the two countries is based on the same ideas, and I believe that even if those who do not know the law but only know how to use barbarian force to benefit themselves become our common enemy and launch a fierce offensive, the same ideas held by the two countries will still stand firm. Through the work of the United China Relief, you are relieving the suffering of our people and rescuing countless innocent wounded. In order to express our gratitude, we are presenting you with a panda. We hope that this gift will bring great joy to the children of America, just as America's friendship has brought to our people. After the speeches of the two Madame Chiangs and Madame Kung, Mr. Teevan made a speech in response, and Mr. Graham reported on the process of capturing the pandas before the meeting ended.

<h3>Addressing the Grave International Situation: White House Holds Military Conference; Possible Increase of American Fleet to the Far East, No Longer Tolerating Japan, Taking Preparatory Steps</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 9th - According to sources from Washington, regarding Roosevelt’s sudden summoning of Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, and other senior generals on Friday for a meeting, American newspapers say that President Roosevelt often convenes such meetings when the situation in the Far East enters a new phase. Several newspapers predict the possibility of the United States Navy immediately sending ships to the Far East to strengthen American defenses there. The "New York Post" states that the arrival of Japanese Ambassador Kurusu in the United States is not for mediation, but to demand a clear "yes" or "no" answer from Washington.</p>
<p>Washington Special Dispatch, 8th - US President Roosevelt today suddenly announced at a reception for reporters that the US government is considering withdrawing the US Marine Corps from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping. Generally, Far East observers consider this equivalent to the US President's "preparatory" order, and say that Roosevelt's brief statement is a concrete warning to Kurusu and the Japanese government, indicating a determination not to tolerate Japan any longer. A final decision will be made on this matter in the short term. This represents a further resolve by the United States to break with Japan, even if it means war. During the session, Roosevelt explained that this move was not the result of talks with Japan. He stated that he did not know what impact this would have on American interests in China, or whether it would create a new situation for American residents there. Secretary of State Hull also declined to comment on Roosevelt's statement, saying only that the State Department does not intend to issue new notices ordering American residents in the Far East to return home. The Navy Department stated that there are only 970 Marines in China, and it is widely believed that after a final decision is made, they will be transferred to Manila.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th - The "Washington Star" newspaper said in yesterday's editorial that President Roosevelt's order for the US Marine Corps to prepare to withdraw from China has increased the severity of the current crisis in US-Japan relations. The newspaper said that the importance of this order is that "the military faction controlling the Tokyo government will definitely not ignore it." It was learned yesterday that an order has been issued instructing the commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in China to prepare for a swift withdrawal. It is understood that this order was issued after Roosevelt announced on Friday that he was considering withdrawing all Marines in China.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 9th - New York Mayor LaGuardia returned here yesterday from a meeting in Washington. He said, "I deeply believe that the situation in the Far East will make all other matters unimportant." He also said, "The situation is very bad. Any action by Japan is of vital concern to us."</p>
<p>Deeply Anxious About American Actions: Eastern Newspapers Issue Articles to Criticize Vigorously</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, Japan - Japanese newspapers today have written editorials, attacking Washington for assisting Thailand and instigating Panama to expel Japanese residents as the peak of provocations. At the same time, "Asahi Shimbun" paid serious attention to the US order to withdraw the Marine Corps from China, believing that this order could be interpreted as the final preparation to cope with the "worst situation" for Japan. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the United States, foreseeing the failure of US-Japan negotiations, has continuously taken anti-Japanese actions, such as withdrawing Far East residents, increasing military and economic aid to China, and intensifying the policy of encircling Japan. The "Kokumin Shimbun," a nationalistic extremist newspaper, stated that the "violent actions" of Panama, a puppet of the United States, regarding the expulsion of Japanese residents may develop into a political incident between the United States and Japan. If the United States and Japan go to war, our loyal and brave navy will find it easy to blockade the Panama Canal. The fact that the United States suffers from "Japanophobia" and exerts pressure on Panama is ridiculous. The newspaper questioned President Roosevelt, saying, "Since the United States advocates human freedom and equality, is this kind of racial discrimination legal?" "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a special article by a correspondent in Bangkok stating that the United States, after the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, has abandoned its indifferent attitude in the Pacific and is now actively supplying Thailand with military supplies. It also stated that the United States has already handed over dozens of various types of military aircraft to Thailand. According to reliable sources, the two countries recently signed a contract under which the United States will hand over two warships of 3,000 tons and many anti-aircraft guns to Thailand by the end of next year. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Panama's actions are violent, inhumane, and absolutely unprecedented in international history. The newspaper stated that "the US policy of not allowing Japanese to reside in the Panama Canal Zone has been implemented through this step." After a spokesperson from the Foreign Ministry announced that Japan could not ignore Panama's move and said that Japan would make another strong protest, Japanese newspapers launched this attack. The Japanese spokesperson pointed out that Asians have suffered the same treatment as blacks after Japanese people were prohibited from engaging in commerce and agriculture in that area. He also said that only Chinese people are still allowed to continue working there, so it can be seen that the Panamanian government's move is purely intentional discrimination against Japan. He also said that the Panama case is obviously due to recent pressure from Washington. He also said that Japan "hopes that the Panamanian government can change this policy of relying on others."</p>
<h3>Decisive War Will Erupt in the Near East; Britain and the Soviet Union Will Cooperate to Defend the Caucasus; Turkey's Position is Crucial</h3>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 9th - Various parties here are gradually recognizing that the decisive battle of this world war will take place in the triangle of the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea. This place has always been known as the "cradle of mankind." It is generally believed here that this historic battle will break out in that area when German forces advance southeast into Iran after reaching Rostov. At that time, Germany will try to seize the Baku and Grozny oil fields, or even try to cross Turkey at the same time. At that time, Britain will have to make a decision on how much manpower it can send into the Caucasus to protect the oil supply in that area, and Turkey will also be forced to make a decision on whether to join any of the warring countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Darwin, 9th - Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Australian Forces, General Blamey, has arrived here from Singapore to participate in the defense conference. It is said that we must fight hard to win. Maintaining manpower and equipment supply is very important. He dares to assert that Tobruk is difficult to conquer. If German forces attack it, it would be a huge mistake. Various equipment are now arriving in the Middle East in large quantities, and negotiations with the Air Force are also very satisfactory. He hopes to return to the Middle East soon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Beirut, 9th - It was officially announced here that General Lavarack, commander of the Australian forces in Syria, has been appointed as acting commander-in-chief of the Australian forces in the Middle East, because the original holder of that position, General Blamey, has now returned to Australia to discuss matters with the government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in the Philippines Continue to Return Home</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - "Asahi Shimbun" reported that since the freezing order was issued, Japanese residents have not been able to engage in commerce in the Philippines, so they have returned home in droves. On Saturday, another 500 Japanese residents, including many women and children, left the Philippines to return to Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Delegation Arrives in Thailand</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 9th - The nine Japanese representatives of the Thai-Vietnam Boundary Demarcation Committee arrived here from Saigon at 11:20 a.m. yesterday on a military aircraft, instead of a civilian aircraft as expected. The Thai and French members will arrive here one after another on Monday and Tuesday. It is heard that the Boundary Demarcation Committee did not complete its work in Saigon due to a lack of certain conveniences, and will now continue discussions in Bangkok.</p>
<h3>Yoshizawa Arrives in Hanoi and Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa and his entourage arrived in Hanoi yesterday afternoon from Haiphong. The French delegation welcomed them on the scene. He met with reporters and said that his mission is to strengthen the political, economic, and cultural relations between Japan and Vietnam. Japan and Vietnam are also geographically close, and it is especially appropriate for them to cooperate with each other. It is heard that Yoshizawa will establish contact and hold talks with the Vietnamese government next week.</p>
<h3>Freedom World Association Holds Meeting in the United States</h3>
<p>Taiwanese Press Agency, New York, 9th - Wu Zhaofang (transliteration), a representative of the Freedom World Association's international peace movement, announced yesterday that the Freedom World Association will convene a conference in New York on November 16 to study procedures to sponsor world economic cooperation. The meeting will be the same as the meetings held in Chongqing, China, and other places on Friday. The 3,000 representatives at the Chongqing meeting sent a message to President Roosevelt, expressing hope for closer military and economic cooperation between the ABCD countries and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>November 20th Set as American Thanksgiving Day; The Whole Country Prays for Peace on This Day</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - President Roosevelt has signed a proclamation designating November 20 as Thanksgiving Day, and asking Americans to pray on this day for a speedy end to the war, and for the early establishment of freedom and justice.</p>
<h3>US Navy Expands Patrol Range in the Atlantic; The Establishment of a Base in Iceland is of Great Significance, Facilitating the Escort of Goods to Britain</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th - Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that the Navy has established a base in Iceland for "administrative and special purposes." This is the sixth base that the United States has obtained in the Atlantic. The United States' bases in the Atlantic are: Newport, Rhode Island; Norfolk, Bermuda; Guantanamo, and Antigua. If the proposed Trinidad is included, then there are seven bases. Reliable sources say that the new base in Iceland will facilitate the escort and patrol work in the North Atlantic. If American merchant ships begin to transport raw materials to the British Isles in accordance with the amended neutrality legislation, then the establishment of a base in Iceland will be of great significance, because the Navy will be able to provide greater protection by taking advantage of Iceland.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 9th - The Navy Department's announcement that the United States has established a naval base in Iceland is generally regarded here as a prelude to the US Navy's large-scale activities in the Atlantic. US warships' patrols and escorts will expand their range. In addition, the amendment to the Neutrality Act has been passed by the Senate and will be returned to the House for review. It is expected that by the end of next week, US ships will be able to carry goods directly to British ports. In addition, the naval base established by the United States in Iceland is of great importance for American goods to be transported to the Soviet Union via the Arkansaw port.</p>
<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Hosts Diplomatic Corps</h3>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 9th - On the 7th, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky held a reception here for the diplomatic corps in commemoration of the October Revolution. Attendees included the leaders of the British, Czech, and Polish legions, the American special mission, and other diplomatic figures. Personnel from the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs also participated in the reception.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Churchill Reiterates Determination to Fight to the End; Britain's Position is Not Comparable to a Year Ago; Beaverbrook Speaks to Munitions Workers</h3>
<p>Please work hard to produce and increase assistance to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Reuters, Sheffield, 9th - British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here from Hull yesterday, spending the night on the train. Although the northeast coast was attacked by enemy aircraft, the British Prime Minister was not disturbed. After arriving here, he addressed thousands of workers on the balcony of the City Hall, saying that we cannot say when the call for a ceasefire will be sounded, but what we do know for sure is that no matter how long or difficult the war is, the British Empire can ultimately achieve victory in a united, fearless, unblemished, and unyielding manner. We will fight unremittingly. Fifteen months ago, we were isolated and unarmed, and the situation was extremely dangerous, but today it is different. The position is already firm, and the future is extremely promising.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manchester, 9th - Minister of Supply Beaverbrook met here yesterday with trade union representatives from seven counties in northern England to discuss wartime production issues. In his opening remarks, Beaverbrook praised the bravery of the Soviet army and expressed confidence in the success of the Soviet resistance, saying that although the war has lasted a long time, the righteous will ultimately win. Beaverbrook also talked about his meeting with Stalin in Moscow with US representative Harriman. It was agreed at that time to supply the Soviet Union with a certain number of tanks per month as needed by the Soviet Union. This has been fulfilled without interruption, and a large amount of raw materials are also being shipped to the Soviet Union, such as Canadian wheat and sugar, all shipped from the United Kingdom. This shows that the British government and the British-Soviet Committee deserve to be trusted. October was a month of great victory in the production of tanks and artillery. Compared with the same month last year, production increased fourfold. British workers have indeed contributed, but they have not yet done their best. It must be known that we are currently fighting on two fronts, one is the British front and the other is the Soviet front. Therefore, what we need to produce is not only what is needed for the British front. He hopes that American workers will double their September production. After the Dunkirk battle, Britain lost most of its sources of aluminum and bauxite, but now it has rectified the import of aluminum and newly obtained the supply of bauxite. The Soviet Union has lost its aluminum, and before he went to Moscow, the Soviet Union issued a notice prioritizing the supply of aluminum. He discussed with Prime Minister Churchill by telephone that the amount required by the Soviet Union was not small, and it was impossible to supply it all. Churchill replied, give it as much as possible, and take a risk for the time being. Stalin was very happy when he heard that we helped with aluminum as needed, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Stalin is indeed a great man, and the Soviet people are well-led, and the Soviet resistance will eventually win. All of this is trustworthy. However, we cannot rely solely on the Soviet resistance. This war is different from the last war. We have not yet fully tasted the pain of this war. Everyone will be harmed by this war, regardless of men or women. What we must contribute and endure in the future will be greater than before. Today, the heavy burden borne by the Soviet Union will be borne by us tomorrow. Beaverbrook then replied in the meeting discussion that the manufacture of British aircraft is distributed everywhere, so it will not be destroyed by enemy attacks. The German side currently has 100,000 or more artillery pieces. There has never been such a large number of artillery pieces gathered in the world, even less than what all countries in the world have. The German side also has many tanks and large aircraft. These weapons will eventually be applied to Britain. We must know that there is only one place in the world where the Germans can get a final settlement, and that is London. As long as we resist, the enemy will have no peace, so sooner or later 100,000 artillery pieces will be aimed at Britain and fired.</p>
<h3>Large-Caliber Aerial Shooting: Combining Speed, Mobility, and Firepower, Can Resist Mechanized Team Offensives</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - The Sunday Times air force interviewer said that the Soviet Union has now discovered a method to stop German mechanized units, which is to shoot from the air with large-caliber guns. Because to stop tanks, three items must be available: range, mobility, and firepower, and an aircraft carrying a large-caliber gun position is the appropriate choice. If Britain and the United States can supply the Soviet Union in large quantities, then it will not be difficult to change the war situation.</p>
<h3>New American Bomber Holds Test Flight</h3>
<p>United Press, Baltimore, 9th - The new 67-ton patrol bomber of the American Navy, which can be called the largest in the world, held its maiden flight ceremony in front of the Army, Navy, Congress, and local celebrities here on the 8th. This new bomber can fly fully loaded with bombs to Europe and then fly back without stopping to add fuel. Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Aeronautics, Gittis, gave a speech, saying that if this new aircraft (named "Mars") is successful, the Navy plans to set up a team of this aircraft. Officials said that this new aircraft has been specially inspected, but further inspection without leaving the water will be tested during the maiden voyage. According to a staff member of the Glenn Martin Company, which built the new aircraft, the company has plans to build aircraft that are still 125 tons, capable of carrying 40 tons of bombs to Europe, averaging 300 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Braving Adverse Weather, British Aircraft Vigorously Attack Berlin: Hundreds of Aircraft Participated in This Battle, Public Communiqué Said 35 Lost</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - On Friday night, the British Air Force launched a very large-scale attack on Berlin, Cologne, and Munich. About 300 to 500 various types of bombers participated in this battle, of which 25 did not fly back, mostly due to bad weather forcing them to land on the way back. Those in charge said that such losses sometimes occur and are unavoidable in war. There is no need to feel frustrated because of this misfortune, and this loss was not caused by improvements in German defenses, but because the weather suddenly changed after the bombers took off, resulting in this loss. The observer of the Wellington bomber claimed that there were dense clouds along the way, and he could not see anything. He had to look up at the stars to determine his direction. The temperature was as low as 34 degrees below freezing, and his fingers were stiff and painful. Another pilot said that the windows of the aircraft were frozen, and the moisture in the aircraft also froze. Thirty miles away from Berlin, he looked down through the gaps in the clouds and saw a river, and was able to determine the direction and head straight for Berlin. After arriving over Berlin, he still detected the target through the gaps in the clouds, and then dropped bombs. Although the people in the aircraft were warmly dressed, they still kept jumping their feet and rubbing their hands, fearing that they would become stiff. The crew of the Halifax bomber said that they were very proud of the battle in Berlin and did see the target being destroyed. The weather in Munich was better, so they could see the bombs exploding and the fire breaking out. The weather in Cologne was not as bad as in Berlin, so the British aircraft flew low to drop bombs and were mostly able to hit the target.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States and Japan at the Crossroads of War and Peace</h3>
<p>Just as Japanese special envoy Saburo Kurusu was en route to America, the U.S. authorities abruptly issued orders yesterday for the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China to prepare for a swift withdrawal. This is a more blatant measure than the evacuation of American citizens carried out last summer and, like the evacuation of American civilians from Guam on the 5th of this month, indicates a serious state of alert on the part of the U.S. government. It is said that Japan had previously made such a request to the U.S., leading some to suspect that this move implies a concession to Japan, a view that has been met with expressions of relief in Japan. However, if we disregard the coincidental nature of this U.S. action and examine it in light of its overall and consistent policy toward the Far East, and in conjunction with the speech delivered by the U.S. President at the Labor Congress two days ago, then those who harbor doubts are perhaps being unduly pessimistic, while those who express relief are being too superficial. If the U.S. withdrawal of civilians from the Far East was not an act of appeasement toward Japan, then this further preparation to withdraw troops is certainly not a concession to Japan.</p>
<p>Naturally, Shanghai is the first to feel a great tremor at this news, and many are worried about the security situation after the U.S. military withdraws. Indeed, the U.S. military's contribution to maintaining order in Shanghai has been commendable in recent years, especially after the withdrawal of British troops, when its responsibility and contribution became even greater. However, Shanghai's position and future are determined by the overall reality of international relations and cannot be entirely controlled by these fewer than a thousand soldiers. If a storm in the Pacific truly breaks out, then what everyone should be concerned about first and foremost is the future of all of humanity and culture. Compared to that, the fate of a single city or region is not worth much consideration. The security and welfare of Shanghai and its residents can only be truly guaranteed after justice is restored and aggression is eradicated. Therefore, the central issue at this moment is the turbulent Far Eastern situation; the withdrawal of U.S. troops is merely a barometer of the times. If the situation does not reach a final breaking point, the U.S. military withdrawal, which is already in preparation, should not be implemented hastily. If the U.S. military truly withdraws, it would indicate that a peaceful resolution to the Far Eastern situation is utterly hopeless. Judging from the actions of the U.S. authorities in recent years, any measure they take, whether it be advancing or retreating, must have a sufficient and powerful basis; they would never act rashly.</p>
<p>The claim of a crisis on November 15th was sensational in the news recently, and it is undeniable that the overall Far Eastern situation continues to move toward a deteriorating future. However, at a time when the success of the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union is still uncertain, and the ABCD powers' joint preparations for contingencies in the Far East are stronger than ever, this is definitely not a time for opportunistic adventures. Anyone with a modicum of reason should be able to discern this. If they recklessly engage in rash actions, then their fate is already sealed; deliberately seeking their own demise is something that almost anyone would try to avoid. Recently, the U.S. side has shown little interest in continuing talks with Japan, while the Tojo cabinet, even before its arrangements were finalized, instructed Nomura and Wakasugi to continue their negotiations. More recently, Kurusu was dispatched to the United States, reportedly carrying a plan approved by the Japanese Emperor. The U.S. approach to the Far East is the same as its approach to the European situation: consistently maintaining a stance of not provoking but not shrinking back. It is clear that it is not the U.S. side that is showing anxiety and impatience, and is desperately trying to reach a final compromise. This is enough to show that the strong contingency measures and economic sanctions taken by the U.S. in the Far East in recent months have already had some initial effect.</p>
<p>However, subjective desires are one thing, and objective possibilities are another. What is currently seen in reality is only Japan's eagerness to ease U.S.-Japan relations and reduce U.S. economic pressure, but there is no sign that it is prepared to pay a corresponding price. The failure of more than seventy days of talks is enough to prove that the U.S. will not tolerate anything unjust. The U.S. insistence on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and its refusal to recognize the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" shows that it is consistently adhering to its position and not making compromises. Therefore, suggestions like the seven points proposed by the Kuangchih Daily can only elicit a smile from Washington. If the plan that Kurusu is carrying is similar to this, then his failure was already determined when he was ordered to embark on his mission, and this trip is proving to be superfluous. However, on the other hand, judging by the extremely arrogant public opinion in Japan recently, the candid remarks made by Saito and Ozaki Yukio in the past are no longer to be seen. Tojo himself has repeatedly stated since taking office that he has a "determination not to change the established national policy," which makes it impossible to imagine that Kurusu's trip could propose conditions acceptable to the U.S. It is speculated that Kurusu's trip will not bring about much change in Japan's basic expansionist policy. What he relies on to impress the U.S. authorities will be the obligations regarding the Tripartite Pact. If people have a good memory, they may recall that at the beginning of the U.S.-Japan talks, the U.S. side revealed its view that it hoped Japan would break away from the Axis. In fact, Japan has never had the determination to decisively fulfill its obligations to Germany. During this period, the Nazis repeatedly lured Japan to join the war, but even after the recent Robin James incident, Japan still maintained an ambiguous attitude. This is probably the greatest hope that Kurusu places on his trip to the U.S. As for other issues, he hopes that the U.S. will make concessions in exchange. However, judging from recent U.S. trends, its concerns about the so-called two-ocean war issue are far less than in the past. The fact that the arming of merchant ships and their entry into war zones could be passed in Congress shows that it has a well-thought-out plan for further participation in the war. Recently, there has been a new shift in the degree of concern in the U.S. government and public between the Far East and the European situation. The Congressional side is expressing a stronger determination to maintain its position in the Far East than to stop Hitler. If Japan only regards getting rid of the Tripartite Pact as a treasure and wants to impress the U.S. with this, it can be asserted that it will not succeed. This time, the U.S. response to Kurusu's visit is unprecedentedly cold, which is quite different from its treatment of Nomura in the past. It is not difficult to see the prospects of this negotiation from this.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whether Kurusu's trip will bring disaster or good fortune to the Far Eastern situation is still an unknown at present, but the possibility of deterioration is far greater than the chance of improvement. Moreover, this negotiation has the serious nature of being at the final crossroads of war and peace. Therefore, it is not surprising that the U.S. is now preparing for the worst-case scenario, and the preparation to withdraw the Marines stationed in China is just one aspect of this. The Far East, which has been in a long and dark night, is now entering the darkest and final stage of the process, but there is no need to worry or doubt about this, because what follows will be the dawning of light.</p>
<h3>Moscow's Defenses Are Consolidated, the Red Army Takes the Initiative, and Launches a Counteroffensive Along the Entire Line on Ice and Snow; Germany Claims Progress in the Crimean War</h3>
<p>United Press International, Kubyshev, 9th: Front Line News: The Red Army launched another fierce attack on the German army yesterday, taking the initiative in the Volokolamsk area and repelling the German army. The German army's attack on Tula, south of the capital, has been stopped after fierce fighting. However, it is reported that the German army is now preparing to launch another attack with heavy tanks and other mechanized reinforcements.</p>
<p>United Press International, Berlin, 9th: The German High Command recently stated that the Romanian army rushed straight along the southern coast of Crimea yesterday and has occupied Yalta.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: According to the latest news received here, the Red Army defending the Soviet capital is still engaged in fierce counterattacks in many places, especially in the Mozhaisk area, which is the most successful. On this, the 21st week of the Soviet-German war, although the German army is trying to make the situation around Moscow chaotic, it is clear that the Nazis have been hindered and have switched to the defensive.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: The most noteworthy of the communiqués issued by both the Soviet and German sides in the past 24 hours is the Soviet army's offensive on the Moscow front and the German army's advance in the Crimea region. The German side said that the unfavorable climate has forced the German army to halt its advance on Moscow. The Soviet army is also feeling the pain of ice, snow, and cold wind, but its courage to counterattack seems to have increased rather than decreased. The Soviet army in the Volokolamsk area, under the command of General Durrato, celebrated the anniversary of the October Revolution by repelling several divisions of the opposing German army. German Marshal Bock has ordered the 70th Regiment under Rosis to attack north of Kalinin in order to stop the Soviet army's actions on this road. The Soviet side admits that there has been fierce fighting in the area. According to the latest intelligence, the Soviet army is now fiercely counterattacking but has not yet broken the German army's resistance. The Soviet side admits that it has been forced to retreat by the German army in some places, but the fact that only 20 German bombers participated in the battle in that area shows that the Soviet side has not lost much ground. The German side is still applying pressure in the Kalinin area, but has not been able to make deep advances. The Soviet army near Mozhaisk is consolidating its defenses on all fronts. It can be seen from this that the Soviet army is preparing to defend and spend the winter. As for whether the German army is also digging trenches and changing from offensive to defensive, there is no definite news yet. The German army's attacking spirit in Crimea has not diminished greatly. If the German side's recent claims are to be believed, then the position of the Kerch Isthmus is now very precarious. According to the German side, the German army has penetrated 6 miles deep into the defensive area there.</p>
<h3>The United States' Shooting Policy: Germany Takes Self-Defense; Hitler Delivers a Speech in Munich, Shifting Responsibility for the War and Exaggerating War Achievements</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Munich, 9th: Führer Hitler delivered a speech to veteran comrades here yesterday on the anniversary of the Nazi Party's uprising, stating that he made efforts for peace in 1939, but these attempts were sabotaged by international democratic warmongers. After Poland surrendered in 18 days, his peace proposal was again rejected by the enemy. Therefore, in 1940, he resolved to annihilate Germany's enemies in the West. After the collapse of France, he again reached out to Britain for a reasonable understanding, but the drunkards who controlled Britain's destiny mistook this for a sign of Germany's weakness and did not dare to continue the war. In fact, his wish was to disregard the loss of life on both sides, but in the background of the hostile countries, there were Jews who lived off war and engaged in global incitement. Therefore, the Soviet Union, a slave of the Jews, also rose up against Germany. Although Stalin was on the stage, Kaganovich and the Jews who controlled the Soviet Union were behind the scenes. When the German army was engaged in Western Europe, a large number of Soviet troops were concentrated on Germany's eastern border, and military preparations increased with time. Therefore, Germany invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Berlin. The result of the negotiations proved that the Soviet army would mobilize at the latest in the autumn of 1941. The demands made by Molotov were the fuse for the Soviet army's invasion of Germany. Therefore, he believed that the die was cast, and Germany could not shirk its arduous task. The Soviet Union's activities in the Balkans further proved its ambitions. Before long, the Soviet army's mobilization was completed. Except for the Soviet army in Moscow and the Far East, all Soviet troops were concentrated on the western border of the Soviet Union. Hitler then released some secret intelligence, claiming that the British House of Commons held several secret meetings in 1940. After heavy drinking, Churchill revealed that the Soviet Union was about to send troops, and Britain only needed to maintain itself for another 18 months to be sufficient. When the war in Southeast Europe was underway, he spied on the Soviet Union's movements. In mid-June, various signs became more and more frightening. In the second half of June, the Soviet Union was already preparing its troops. Therefore, he was forced to order the German army to attack the Soviet Union on June 22. This was the greatest decision he had ever made in his life. He also made preparations on the Western Front and welcomed the enemy's visit. The German-occupied countries in Western Europe have built strong defensive works, most of which were the labor of the Todt Organization. This anti-Soviet campaign is a unanimous action by the whole of Europe. The purpose of this war is twofold: one is to annihilate the enemy army, and the other is to occupy the enemy's fire centers and major agricultural production areas. Regarding the battle of Leningrad, before completing the encirclement, the German army was purely on the offensive, but now it has switched to the defensive, because what he is concerned about is not the city of Leningrad, but to destroy its military industry.</p>
<h3>Achievements on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Summarizing the achievements of this campaign, the number of Soviet troops captured to date is approximately 3,600,000. To be more precise, it is 3,660,000. Stalin now claims that our army's losses have reached 4,500,000, while 378,000 Soviet troops are missing, 350,000 were killed in action, and 1,000,000 were wounded. He now asks why the number of Soviet troops lost is only half that of our army, but they have retreated 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers away. We will make the Soviet prisoners engage in useful work for Europe. At that time, everyone will be able to find that the number is not 370,000, but 3,600,000. In addition, the number of Soviet military equipment destroyed or seized by our army is also quite considerable, including 15,000 aircraft, more than 22,000 tanks, and more than 27,000 cannons. It would take a long time for the world's industry, including Germany's industry, to replenish this loss. Of course, the democratic countries will not be able to replenish it within a few years. Our army has occupied 1,670,000 square kilometers of Soviet territory. Sixty to seventy-five percent of the Soviet Union's industry and raw material production areas are located in this area.</p>
<h3>Admitting Operational Difficulties</h3>
<p>Hitler then refuted the claim that the German command was unable to carry out a blitzkrieg, saying that if they thought they should carry out a blitzkrieg, they would do so, but in any case, the soldiers must have time to walk. The distance from the German border to Rostov, Crimea, or Leningrad is considerable, and the roads are extremely rugged. He never used the term blitzkrieg, which is crazy talk. No country in the world's history has been defeated and resolved faster than the Soviet Union. The German army's victory was achieved under difficult circumstances, and the infantry's contribution is especially undeniable. Now, behind the first line of defense on the front, there is the second line of defense in Berlin and Rome, and behind that, there is the third line of defense composed of the whole of Europe. The enemy's boasted armament plan does not interest us at all, because Germany's arms industry has always been and will always be above the enemy's. Germany is able to utilize the resources of the entire German-occupied territories. The Germans participating in the war today are not the Germans of World War I. The German people are never willing to do the same work. He personally has never done one thing twice. The German troops stationed in the occupied areas are extremely polite to the civilians. The German army never rapes or loots, and always considers the civilians. It is probably because the German army is too polite that tragedies continue to occur. If anyone believes that they can intimidate us with assassination and other means, we will never forgive them and will deal with them in the same way. The enemy has claimed that the war will be extended to 1942. In any case, no matter how long the war is extended, the final victory will undoubtedly belong to Germany.</p>
<h3>Discussing Relations with the United States</h3>
<p>Hitler then discussed the United States, saying that the U.S. President thinks that the shooting order is enough to make us afraid. We can only answer that Roosevelt ordered his ships to shoot at German ships as soon as they see them. He ordered German ships not to shoot at American ships as soon as they see them, but if they are attacked, they must immediately take self-defense actions. German officers who do not take self-defense will be subject to military law. Therefore, if American ships obey their President's orders and attack German ships, they are taking their own risks. German ships will immediately defend themselves, and German torpedoes will not spare those who do not attack. Regarding the so-called map of Germany dividing South America, Hitler said that he is not a small student and is not good at drawing maps in the classroom. As for how many kinds of religions there are in the world, he is not interested. Everyone in Germany is able to believe in the religion they like. The German government grants 900 million marks to various churches every year. Priests have never been killed for publicly preaching their doctrines, but if they interfere in national affairs, they should be punished according to the law. In short, the campaign against the Soviet Union is to remove the danger in Eastern Europe so that the natural resources of the East can benefit the whole of Europe, rather than be occupied by a few thugs who threaten Europe. The fate of Europe for the next few thousand years will be determined by this campaign. The ultimate goal of our campaign is to achieve our consistent and unchangeable goal.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Stalin Exchange Letters, Agreeing to Direct Communication if Future Circumstances Require It</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: In the letters exchanged between President Roosevelt and Stalin regarding the $100 million U.S. loan, it was mentioned that if circumstances require it, the two men could communicate directly. Today, Moscow Radio broadcasted the contents of the two men's letters as follows: President Roosevelt wrote that he had read the protocol of the Moscow Conference and discussed its details with the delegation members. All military resources and various armaments have been approved by him, and he has ordered the acceleration of the transportation of raw materials as much as possible. President Roosevelt's letter also mentioned that after thanking Stalin and others for enabling the Moscow Conference to be concluded quickly, he said that he hoped that Mr. Stalin would feel free to communicate directly with him if he wished, without hesitation. Stalin's reply also praised the perfection of the work of the Moscow Conference and attributed the achievements of the conference to the U.S. representative Harriman and the British representative Lord Beaverbrook. Stalin expressed his gratitude to President Roosevelt, especially for his full support and the huge loan this time. The letter also said that he fully agreed with the proposal for direct communication between the two sides.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Residents' Preparations Amidst the U.S. Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>— Chen Ren</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt announced to the press the day before yesterday that he was considering withdrawing troops stationed in China. It is said that the U.S. Marine Corps here has also received orders to prepare for immediate withdrawal. Although "considering" and "preparing" may still have some nuances, various speculations believe that this move aims to strengthen its position during negotiations with Japan, while also expressing the U.S. Navy's determination to fight. There may still be a considerable time lag between the withdrawal of troops stationed in China and the start of the U.S.-Japan war; the night is long and fraught with dreams, and what the future will hold is currently impossible to say definitively. However, in any case, if Japan does not stop its invasion of China, the U.S. will not hesitate to go to war. Japan sent Kurusu to the U.S. and stated that a final decision should be made before Japan convenes an extraordinary parliament on November 15; the U.S. must also respond by withdrawing troops stationed in China, preparing for a major war that may break out immediately. If Japan's above-mentioned claim is a kind of psychological warfare, then this move by the U.S. can also be regarded as a response to that psychological warfare. If Japan truly has the courage to act recklessly, this move indicates that the U.S. is prepared to accompany them. If the content of the negotiations that Kurusu took to the U.S., as reported in the Kuangchih Daily a few days ago, is indeed true, then he is bound to make a futile trip. Would Kurusu's futile trip becoming a reality mean that the Far Eastern situation has reached a final juncture? In this present time of ever-changing international winds and clouds, it is also impossible to predict. In particular, Japan often uses cabinet reshuffles as a means of easing tense situations. Then, there is another footnote to the future of the Far East. That is, if Japan cannot defeat the joint front of the ABCD powers by force, then it must abandon its plan for a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." No one dares to believe that Japan has this certainty, so no one believes that this move brings China closer to victory. However, the closer the Chinese nation is to victory, the worse Shanghai's current situation will be. For the sake of the future of the Chinese nation and the coming of world peace, the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai must also be willing to accept such an era. Then, in this present time, when this era has not yet arrived but is about to arrive, what preparations should the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai make? This is a truly major problem. At this time, amidst the news of the U.S. troop withdrawal, the resolution of this problem feels even more urgent.</p>
<h3>Six Preparations</h3>
<p>Speaking of preparations, there are truly a thousand and one things. In summary, the following points must be prepared in advance.</p>
<p>Prepare to offer one's life and labor to help establish the "East Asia New Order."</p>
<p>Japan is already feeling its sources of soldiers drying up due to the war against China alone. If a war between Japan and the U.S. breaks out, the Soviet Union will inevitably establish two major battlefields in the East and West. Therefore, Japan will need to fight on three fronts. Among the five million people in Shanghai, those who are deemed to have a "danger of disrupting the East Asia New Order" will be dealt with severely: those with serious crimes will be executed, saving a sum of prison food; those with minor crimes will be sent to concentration camps to work. Submissive elements, the strong ones, may be sent to the front lines to serve as soldiers or laborers, or driven into factories to work. The disabled, old, and weak, if there is a need to conserve food, may be subject to an active measure to reduce the population.</p>
<p>Prepare to offer one's property to help complete the "resource adjustment plan for the construction of the East Asia New Order." Material resources are an element of modern warfare.</p>
<p>Japan is suffering from a material panic. The hundreds of billions of dollars worth of hoarded goods in the concessions of this city may not play a large role in Japan's war needs, but they can still provide some supplementary assistance. There are two ways to concentrate this hoarded goods: one is unconditional requisition, and the other is compulsory purchase at official prices. Real estate is no exception. Steel rebars in the windows and walls may also be requisitioned if necessary, just like during the last European war, when any copper and iron products on the doors and windows of German residences were removed to be used for casting military supplies. This may be staged in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Prepare to hand over gold, silver, and other precious metals as a condition for redeeming one's life.</p>
<p>Although gold, silver, and other precious metals are not military materials, on the day the Pacific War begins, Japan's foreign trade will also be completely suspended. It seems that there is no need to concentrate gold, silver, and other precious metals. However, Japan needs to pay reparations after the war, or for the needs of post-war reconstruction, especially for the needs of post-war monetary reform, then the precious metals collected in the Shanghai concession area today must be "nationalized" and transported to Tokyo. If anyone hides and does not hand them over, they will be punished by death.</p>
<p>Prepare to hand over the management rights of factories and listen to the command of the "Wartime Industrial Production Management Ordinance."</p>
<p>At this time, all production must be adapted to Japan's military needs in its operations. However, very few of Shanghai's industrial production equipment today can match Japan's needs in this regard. Therefore, the machines that can be refitted for military production will be retained; the machines that cannot be refitted for military operations will be completely dismantled, transported to Japan, and put into the furnace to be converted into guns, cannons, or other machines.</p>
<p>Prepare to hand over the management rights of stores and listen to the management of the "Wartime Commercial Management Ordinance."</p>
<p>Japan wants to establish its wartime economic order in Shanghai, and the current free commercial system must be fundamentally transformed. The hoarded goods in warehouses should be sealed off and not be moved without authorization, and those who violate this will be severely punished. Even the inventory and working capital in stores must be fully reported and registered. Those that meet military needs should be handed over first, and those that meet civilian needs must apply for permission before they can be traded.</p>
<p>Prepare to present the account books and records of the silver and money industry and accept the management of the "Wartime Financial Industry Management Ordinance."</p>
<h3>Essential Strategies for Reforming the Rice Market: Supporting the People</h3>
<p>Unifying Rice Prices: Eradicating the Free Market, Implementing Unified Transportation and Sales, and Ensuring Only Publicly Operated Agencies Deliver Rice. Absolutely Prohibiting Unlicensed Rice Transportation.</p>
<p>The concession authorities' public sale of Hong Kong rice and small polished rice, benefiting the common people, is undoubtedly a great virtue. However, unscrupulous merchants profit from it, leading to endless abuses, as reported in the newspapers countless times. The authorities seem unable to prevent it effectively. Why has it come to this? Purely because the rice market has another expensive price for Hong Kong rice and small polished rice, which makes unscrupulous people obsessed with profit. As the saying goes, "You can only be a thief for a thousand years, but you can't defend against thieves for ten thousand years." To eliminate using public office for private gain, there is only one way: to fundamentally prohibit the free market for Hong Kong rice and small polished rice and completely ban the free pricing of Hong Kong rice and small polished rice. If there is only one selling price for Hong Kong rice and small polished rice in the Shanghai market, then private gain and corruption will not occur. If, in addition to the public sale price, there is another expensive free market price, then the phenomenon of being blinded by profit will be inevitable. The authorities' strict investigation and prohibition can only achieve "exhausting all efforts," and the result will still be labor without success.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the concession authorities' handling of the transportation and sale of Hong Kong rice and small polished rice, it was said that a unified transportation and sales system had been adopted, and merchants could not interfere. To ensure the sustainability and stability of the publicly operated agency, it is essential to implement unified transportation and sales. However, if unified transportation and sales have already been implemented, then the supply of Hong Kong rice and small polished rice has obviously been concentrated in the hands of the authorities. Why is there now another expensive selling price for Hong Kong rice and small polished rice in the rice market? Could it be that the unified transportation and sales system has not yet been implemented?</p>
<p>If the principle of unified transportation and sales has not been achieved, then based on this failure experience, the method of unified transportation and sales should be implemented immediately. Otherwise, when ordering from Hong Kong and Vietnam, there will be competition from unscrupulous merchants bidding up prices, and when selling in Shanghai, another market price with different prices will inevitably occur in addition to the public sale price. If another selling price is cheaper than the public sale price, it will indeed have the effect of suppressing rice prices, but it will be taking a risk for the sustainability of the public sale policy. If another selling price can be sold at the public sale price, then it will be difficult to prohibit private gain and corruption, because there is no difference between the bureau rice and private rice, and it is entirely possible to pass off fish eyes as pearls and profit from it.</p>
<p>The public sale of Hong Kong rice and small polished rice was originally a virtuous policy to stabilize the people's food supply, not a philanthropic act. Because philanthropic acts require strong financial backing. Can the concession's finances, which are already overwhelmed by tax increases, be up to the task? Moreover, in fact, the public sale funds today are said to be taken from the public warehouse fund raised at the beginning of the year. This fund is not public money in nature, and its quantity is extremely limited, making it unsuitable as philanthropic funding. Moreover, to do philanthropy, it must be done thoroughly. If the Tongren Fuyuantang only collects 1,000 corpses from the streets each year and leaves the rest to rot in the streets, then its contribution to public health cannot be as great as it is today when it collects corpses without restriction. Since the concession authorities intend to do good, they should make good use of this fund.</p>
<p>Thinking about the beginning of this rice crisis, it started with rice shops hanging up signs saying "Bureau rice sold out," followed by a surge in the free selling price of small polished rice, etc., in the market. In comparison, it is reasonable to thoroughly investigate the source of small polished rice in the market on the one hand, and strictly punish rice shops for concealing rice and not selling it and using public office for private gain on the other hand. If it is really "Bureau rice sold out," then that is strange. Because the funds already exist, and there is no problem with the turnover of funds for transportation and sales. When the public sale was first started, there may have been a phenomenon of running out of stock. After that, there should be no reason to interrupt it, unless the manager does not immediately use the proceeds from the sale to continue ordering. Or the equalization association's foreign exchange measures for supplying rice purchases are delayed for a while. If it is the former, I sincerely hope that the authorities will check the rice accounts to prevent future troubles. If it is the latter, I hope that the association will not make the mistake of indecision again.</p>
<p>Finally, anyone who sees the current public sale situation will sigh with emotion. The people's waiting on the streets, wasting time and abandoning their work, is already extremely unjust, and the blockage of passages for nearby shops and residents, making it difficult to enter and exit and invisibly suspending business, is even more unjust. Every time there is a crowd surge, beatings are inevitable. And the occurrence of crowd surges is often caused by nearby shops or residents breaking out. Therefore, the humiliation or beating of shop staff and residents is inevitable. This shows that the current method is inappropriate, as the patrol police maintaining order are already exhausted. Imagine those who wait all day and still don't get a peck or a liter of rice.</p>
<p>Why does the public sale reach such a point? In a nutshell, it is to prevent the publicly operated rice shops from engaging in corruption and to prevent wealthy people from hoarding large quantities. And the corruption of the rice shops and the hoarding of wealthy people are purely lured by the expensive market price. Therefore, the first thing to do is to eradicate the free market for Hong Kong rice and small polished rice and its free prices, and the second thing to do is to eradicate concealment and hoarding. To achieve the eradication of concealment and hoarding, the easiest and most effective way is to prohibit rice shops from delivering goods to customers. Because all large transactions require delivery. Once rice shops deliver goods to customers, it is difficult to ensure that customers do not buy more and hoard more.</p>
<p>The implementation of the ban on delivery must be accompanied by a permit system for transporting rice. All rice merchants transporting rice should first obtain a permit. The police along the way should inspect any rice carts, and if there is no permit, they should be detained. However, the issuance of this permit should meet the above conditions, otherwise, abuses will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>The validity of the permit is limited to one time. It must be in quadruplicate: one copy is kept by the bureau, one copy is kept by the guard at the shipping station, one copy is kept by the guard near the unloading station, and one copy is submitted to the bureau by the receiving rice shop immediately after receiving the goods. The bureau compiles and cancels each copy every day.</p>
<p>The permit should indicate the origin and destination, the names of the buying and selling merchants, the transportation route, the quantity (one sheet per cart, so the quantity per sheet cannot exceed the capacity of one cart), the effective date and time, and the seal of the issuing agency.</p>
<p>Any rice cart should have a permit, one for each trip, regardless of the type of rice. The unloading station is limited to rice shops. A special notification will be issued for any newly imported rice entering the warehouse.</p>
<p>If this can be done, then not only can the abuses of hoarding bureau rice be prevented, but also the attempt to hoard other rice will be difficult to achieve. The future of Shanghai's rice prices is almost assured.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The concession authorities have implemented a permit system for transporting rice out of the concession since yesterday. However, we hope that further measures will be taken to address hoarding activities within the concession, such as those suggested in this article, which are worth noting.</p>
<p>The account books and records of silver and money businesses are not enough to clarify "Chongqing Enemy Property" unless they are submitted for inspection. At the same time, it is also not easy to understand the current hoarding situation in Shanghai. Moreover, in order to facilitate the use of Shanghai people's manpower, it is necessary to distinguish between the poor and the rich, and then the standard of "exemption from military service" can be determined. Because all those who apply for "exemption from military service," their "exemption tax" should be based on their "ability to pay taxes" in order to be in line with the "principle of equality."</p>
<h3>As for Legal Tender</h3>
<p>As for Shanghai's legal tender, that may not be a problem. Although it cannot be used to buy foreign exchange, it can still be used to obtain materials in the neighboring guerrilla areas. Moreover, looking forward to the war, even in Tokyo and Nanjing, there is no confidence. For the sake of Japan's post-war monetary system, in addition to retaining the only gold and silver, it is also necessary to retain this legal tender, which has the same value as gold and silver. Because the legal tender has been linked to the international financial authorities' US dollar and British pound, holding legal tender can make up for the insufficient amount of remaining silver. Therefore, it is very likely that the legal tender will be used as one of its guarantee reserves in the future issuance of banknotes by the Bank of Japan. Even if Nanjing intends to promote new banknotes, it is necessary to use legal tender as a guarantee reserve. Because of this, the competition for the storage of legal tender may unexpectedly be staged.</p>
<h3>As for Food</h3>
<p>As for the food at that time, there will probably be no problem, partly because of the dispersal of the population, partly because of the release of hoarded goods, partly because Shanghai has become Japan's "supply depot" and "important rear base," and partly because Japan will do everything possible to connect the Chinese coast with Vietnam to form an "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" and "adjust everything." But to enjoy the cheap rice at that time, you should first make the six preparations mentioned above. In other words, if you don't hand over your life and property, you have no right to enjoy it. But then, handing over your life and property will also ruin your life and property after the war. Is it to be safe for a while? Or to plan for a better future life? That depends on each person's choice.</p>
<h3>After the Withdrawal of US Troops, Shanghai's Economic Status as</h3>
<p>— He Liangxi</p>
<p>Although the flames of war are everywhere, the Chinese and foreign people residing in Shanghai, due to the special circumstances of the area, are living in a corner of peace and enjoying "prosperity" alone. However, things will turn bad after reaching the extreme, and prosperity will decline after reaching the peak. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 8th, the US Marine Corps in China has been ordered to prepare to withdraw immediately. Indeed, once the US and Japan go to war, the US Marine Corps in China will have absolutely no need to stay in China, and at the same time, the US expatriates will have no reason to stay any longer.</p>
<p>If the US Marine Corps in China really withdraws, Shanghai's economic status will inevitably become a problem.</p>
<p>First, from the aspect of funds: the huge amount of floating capital in Shanghai has long been worried about by those who are knowledgeable, but the speakers are sincere, and the listeners are contemptuous. People with a large amount of floating capital only use it for speculation in order to seek exorbitant profits. And the recent opening of banks, money shops, and silver firms is like bamboo shoots after a rain. Before they have a firm foothold, they will encounter this major change, and the danger of the future can be imagined. If there is a change in the financial world, the result will inevitably create a situation where one hair moves the whole body.</p>
<p>Second, from the aspect of commodities: what about commodities? Some people may think that hoarding goods, because they have real goods in hand, are not afraid of anything. However, if the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? Hoarding goods will not be safe either, and will suffer even more unfavorable fate. When a certain party has no use for or enjoyment of Shanghai, it will inevitably take the means of killing the chicken. To put it plainly, a certain party will use force to control all existing goods and production machinery; then comes an "adjustment order" to "adjust the supply and demand of materials in this city." As a result, family warehouses become public warehouses, and you have to apply to the authorities for a "permit" to eat your own hoarded grain and stored goods. As for the goods stored in general warehouses and godowns, not to mention, to be polite, they are forcibly bought with miscellaneous banknotes at "official prices"; impolitely, they are confiscated and confiscated, and it is strictly stated that "those who hoard will die." The general people hoard goods for their own consumption, or to make a "fortune." Hoarding goods cannot be eaten by themselves, and cannot be sold at a good price, but the holder of the goods is guilty. What is the point! I advise you gentlemen who hoard goods, instead of suffering and falling empty in the future, it is better to sell them early and enjoy the present benefits; and invest the proceeds in legitimate businesses in the great rear area to protect your own lives.</p>
<p>Following the emergence of the above two possible consequences, the people and funds of Shanghai will inevitably flee. At that time, Shanghai will be a dead port and a desolate island, not worthy of being called a "hustle." But we don't need to worry, because the firm stance of the United States will be seen in action as soon as possible, and the situation in the Far East can be clarified as soon as possible. The moment before dawn, the darkness is even greater. Therefore, temporary difficulties should be endured and overcome, then the end of suffering will not be far away.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Implementation of Price Controls: Rice Prices Limited from Today: No More Than 100 Yuan Per Stone, Residents Limited to 8 Kilograms for Retail Purchases, Violators Will Be Expelled from the Concession</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department, in view of the fact that it is necessary to first solve the problem of the food supply for the entire city in order to suppress the ever-increasing prices in the port, has been holding meetings every day for the past two weeks to discuss and study the implementation methods. Especially since the approval of the new appendix by the consular corps, the Public Works Department has insisted on the greatest determination, and all kinds of implementation details have been prepared. The Equalization Fund Committee has also agreed to supply 250,000 bags of foreign rice per month for the foreign exchange needed for import. Therefore, the Public Works Department held a special board meeting in the board meeting hall at 11 o'clock yesterday morning. Because the director general, Mr. Liddell, went to Hong Kong on business, the meeting was chaired by the deputy director general, Mr. Okamoto. All other directors of all nationalities attended, except for Mr. Minds, the American director, who was also on official business in Hong Kong. At the meeting, a broad review was made of the recent price and rice market situation, and a final conclusion was made on all issues. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Fessenden, the chief executive and director general, received Chinese and foreign reporters and announced the price control plan. Two hours later, the Information Office released a variety of announcements based on what Mr. Fessenden said, including: Fessenden's announcement on the management of food rice methods, a supplementary explanation of the announcement, a notice of the establishment of rice sales points, the regulations on the price increase of foreign rice, the measures to limit the quantity of rice sold by rice shops, the regulations on the time of rice sales by rice shops, the methods for factories and institutions to purchase flat rice, and the methods for taxpayers in the Puxi border area to purchase flat rice. The Public Works Department has obtained the cooperation of the French Municipal Council on all of the above points.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Notice</h3>
<p>(The French Concession issued a similar notice through French Consul General Majella.) For the purpose of notice, this bureau is now in complete cooperation with the French Concession authorities to prohibit the manipulation of the main food supply of the public for profit, and hereby publishes the following measures:</p>
<p>From November 10 (Monday) of this year, the price at which wholesale merchants sell imported rice to other retail merchants shall not exceed 158.95 yuan in national currency per bag (total weight of 224 pounds out of the warehouse (i.e., the gross weight including the bag)). The price at which retail merchants sell shall not exceed 130 yuan in national currency per stone (sufficient weight of 160 market catties) (i.e., the net weight).</p>
<p>If anyone sells imported rice at a price exceeding the price specified in the above section of this notice, this bureau will revoke the license granted to him to sell food in the Public Concession and will not protect or expel him.</p>
<p>Any wholesale or retail merchant who refuses to sell imported rice stored in the shop shall also have his license to sell food in the Public Concession revoked, and shall not be protected or expelled. The rice stored in the shop shall be purchased by this bureau, at a price of up to 120 yuan in national currency per stone (depending on the grade and quality of the rice).</p>
<p>No one shall transport any quality or quantity of rice out of the Public Concession (except to the French Concession) without first obtaining a special permit from the police department of this bureau. Except for the quantity of rice purchased by food households from retail merchants that has been approved at any time, which may be transported within the Public Concession without applying for a permit, rice without a permit shall not be transported within the Public Concession. Permits for transporting rice in quantities exceeding the amount of food rice will only be granted to recognized merchants. If rice is transported without authorization in violation of the measures stipulated in this notice, it shall be seized on the spot by the patrolmen once it is discovered and no compensation shall be given. This is hereby announced. November 9, 1941, Fessenden, Chief Executive and Director General.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Provide as Much Mortgage as Possible: The Equalization Fund Committee is concerned about the food supply for the people of Shanghai and agrees to provide foreign exchange for the Public Works Department's foreign rice, up to 250,000 bags. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency also learned from authoritative sources yesterday that the funds for the Public Works Department to order foreign rice are mortgaged by foreign banks. The original maximum limit was not to exceed 15 million yuan in national currency per time. Since the foreign exchange settlement has been approved, foreign banks have been providing as much mortgage as possible for rice, without limiting the amount. Therefore, there will be no shortage of food for the people of Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Two Authorities Issue Supplementary Announcements</p>
<p>The two concession authorities have taken strong steps to crack down on the hoarding of rice for profit. Along with the Public Works Department's announcement, the Information Office of the bureau issued a supplementary announcement stating that the huge amount of foreign rice issued in the past two weeks undoubtedly shows that the trend of hoarding is still very common. This trend has created the opportunity for the current hoarding. Looking back at May of this year, the bureau proved its ability to stabilize the rice market. To this day, the bureau's determination to prevent the profiteering of rice and other important food has not weakened at all. The announcement issued by this bureau with the consent of the French Concession Municipal Council should be regarded as an appeal to all residents for cooperation. For the sake of the interests of all, strong measures are now being taken, and at the same time, it should be regarded as a warning to anyone who opposes the public interest.</p>
<p>Cooperation from Users to Eradicate Profiteering: If we can obtain the enthusiastic cooperation of users, then the bureau is confident that the various methods currently being taken and expanded due to the new appendix can permanently eliminate the profiteering of rice. All citizens should know that the current rice stock in the Public Concession is sufficient to meet the needs of all users. When the bureau stipulated the high selling price of imported foreign rice at 130 yuan, (according to this selling price, the foreign rice should be sold to food households from the aspect of legitimate business,) it knows that the profit given by this selling price is no less than the legitimate profit that imported rice should get. As for the selling price of Saigon broken rice, it should be lower. At a time when the problem of the main food of the majority of residents in the Public Concession is extremely important, there are still those who buy rice at high prices in order to seek profit. It can be seen that they will be in a difficult situation and it is difficult to obtain public opinion.</p>
<p>Refusal to Sell Rice is Prepared to be Purchased</p>
<p>According to the above notice, it is illegal to sell rice more than 5% higher, or to sell at a retail price of 100 yuan per stone. It is also an illegal act for licensed retail rice merchants to refuse to sell their stock. In addition, it is also an illegal act to transport rice without authorization within the boundary of the Public Concession without a permit, but this does not apply to the small amount of the highest quantity that users are allowed to purchase at any time announced by this bureau. Except for those deemed necessary by this bureau in the aspect of normal business, such as the transfer from importers to wholesalers or retailers, rice transportation permits will not be issued. This bureau sincerely requests the cooperation of all levels of society, and at the same time hopes that there will be no need to take more severe measures in the future, and in order to establish the confidence in the ability to ensure the satisfactory distribution of rice, we are prepared to purchase rice stocks. This kind of rice stock is what the owners refuse to sell to the public. Once the bureau purchases it, it will immediately sell it to retail rice merchants who are willing to cooperate with the bureau, so as to retail it, or place it in the rice sales points established by this bureau and sell it directly to the public.</p>
<p>Violators Will Be Expelled from the Country</p>
<p>The penalties for violating the provisions in the notice include the revocation of licenses, expulsion from the country, and the confiscation of rice transported without a permit, etc. At the same time, the price of foreign rice at this bureau has been increased to 130 yuan per stone, which has nothing to do with limiting the selling price of other foreign rice. Because the original price of foreign rice at this bureau in Hong Kong has risen, it is necessary to increase the price by one level. The selling price of foreign rice sold in this port shall be determined according to the price, freight, and other expenses of the place of origin. This bureau has now continued to order foreign rice, and it is firmly believed that the above-mentioned selling price of 130 yuan can be maintained for some time. This bureau has now established four rice sales points, two of which will supply general users who cannot buy rice from rice shops with another number of stars, one for institutions and factories in the boundary, and the other for taxpayers in the Puxi border road area. See the bureau's announcement for details.</p>
<p>The Adopted Method Can Still be Stricter</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities added yesterday that the announcement issued jointly by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the French authorities can be regarded as a request for the residents to cooperate (the adoption of this measure is for the benefit of the residents). The announcement can also be regarded as a kind of warning to those who continue to violate the public interest. I think the residents will fully understand that although the measures have inconveniences, the authorities firmly believe that the method adopted (the angle is heavier and more possible) can eliminate the speculation of rice. The public should know that the rice stored in the French Concession and in the Public Concession is sufficient for (the residents to eat and have more than enough. Those who transport rice in the boundary will also be punished, except for the quantity of rice that the residents are allowed to purchase for their own needs (stipulated to be eight kilograms, i.e. 17.6 pounds).</p>
<p>Bureau Sales Implemented: The Public Works Department has just released an announcement stating that the two rice sales points established by this bureau have been established. From now on, citizens can purchase rice from each rice sales point in the same way as buying rice from retail rice shops in the boundary. Residents south of the Suzhou River should purchase from the rice sales point established at the Gordon Road Police Station. As for residents north of the Suzhou River, they should purchase from the rice sales point established at the corner of Fair Road and Zhoujiazui Road. The sales time of each rice sales point is tentatively set from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm every day.</p>
<p>Flat Rice Price Increase: The Public Works Department announced that from the 10th of this month, the selling price of the bureau's foreign rice will be increased, and the highest retail price will be changed to 130 yuan in national currency per stone (net weight of 160 market catties). From the 10th of this month, the rice selling time of each retail rice shop in the Public Concession will be limited to 6:00 am to 2:00 pm, and 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>Purchase Method: The Public Works Department has just released an announcement stating that offices, factories, hospitals, charitable organizations, and schools in the boundary can apply to the bureau's General Office, Room 703 (enter and exit from the bureau's square) to purchase the amount of rice they need each month. When applying for purchase, the person in charge shall fill out the application form on the spot. The rice price must be paid in cash, and then a delivery voucher will be issued. Once the applicant has obtained the delivery voucher, he shall quickly collect the rice from the bureau's rice storage office. The ex-warehouse selling price of the bureau's foreign rice is currently 165.1 yuan per bag.</p>
<p>Quantity Restriction: The Public Works Department issued an announcement on restricting the quantity of rice sold by rice shops, stating that the quantity of any foreign rice sold by retail rice shops within the Public Concession shall not exceed the quantity of the bureau's foreign rice sold. The amount of this sale is determined by the Mountain Wood Bureau at any time.</p>
<p>Puxi Purchases Law: The Public Works Department has just released an announcement stating that all taxpayers can apply to the bureau's General Office, Room 703, 209 Jiangxi Road (enter and exit from the bureau's square) from 9:00 am on the 10th of this month to purchase the amount of rice they need each month. When applying for purchase, they shall present their receipt for the Municipal Special Donation (i.e., special housing donation) paid to the bureau, proving that they have paid the special donation for the past quarter of this year, and the person in charge shall fill out the application form on the spot. The rice price must be paid in cash, and then a delivery voucher will be issued. Once the applicant has obtained the delivery voucher, he shall go to the foreign rice storage office in the Jing'an Temple Police Station, 172 Yuyuan Road, to collect the rice. If the quantity of food rice collected is less than one bag, the applicant must prepare his own container for transportation. The ex-warehouse selling price of the bureau's foreign rice is currently 165.1 yuan per bag and 130 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Business Groups Send Defense to Assist in Investigation</p>
<p>The International Business Group has received orders to stand by armed. All teams of all nationalities are now ready. Once the official order to mobilize is issued, they can be sent out within 30 minutes. However, when the orders to send out each team will be issued is still undecided. Only C-Team Armored Car Team has received orders to be sent out armed at 5:00 am this morning (10th). However, it is said that the Japanese team of the International Business Group has not received orders to send out. Therefore, it is still unclear whether the sudden defense of the Business Group is related to the withdrawal of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China. One saying is that the defense is to help the Public Works Department deal with suppressing rice prices, and investigations will be conducted at shops. If hoarding of rice and refusal to sell or exceeding the price limit are found, they will be expelled from the country. Therefore, it is expected that after the two concession authorities take these severe measures, the serious food problem can be expected to calm down.</p>
<h3>Prices of Daily Necessities Sold at Tobacco and Exchange Businesses Relax, Retail Prices Not Uniform</h3>
<p>Since the Tobacco and Exchange Businesses Association stipulated six measures and notified the market to strictly implement them, general businesses have been visibly constrained in their buying and selling activities. Illegal transactions such as acting as agents for buying and selling have now diminished. According to the association's information yesterday, the tobacco exchange market is now very sluggish, market conditions are stable, and the prices of various daily necessities such as soap, matches, and kerosene have been gradually relaxing, and will soon decline further. As for those who are now hoarding goods in the market, hoping to profit by raising prices, their transaction prices are not reliable. Furthermore, the retail prices of tobacco shops are not only exceeding reasonable profits, but also inconsistent.</p>
<h3>Retail Price Limit for Milk Powder</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council announced that, according to Consular Decree No. 78 of February 19, 1940, the French Concession authorities have set the following retail prices for Klim brand canned milk powder: 1-pound cans at 10 yuan in legal tender per can, 2.5-pound cans at 37.50 yuan in legal tender per can, and 5-pound cans at 70 yuan in legal tender per can.</p>
<h3>Flourishing of Rear Area Industry: Seven Factories Have Started Production: Chemicals, Pigments, Paper, Needle Manufacturing, Steel Refining, Waterworks, Flour Mill</h3>
<p>According to information revealed by various industrial groups in the city on November 9, 1941, the private factories relocated and newly established under the auspices of the Industrial Adjustment Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have recently started production and shipping goods one after another, greatly benefiting production and supply in the rear area.</p>
<p>Qinghua Chemical Pigment Factory: All production parts of hydrogen sulfide dyes and sulfide auxiliary dyes have started production one after another. Its various products, after being tested by a Chongqing dyeing factory, are indeed comparable to German products, making it the only sulfide blue dye manufacturer in the rear area.</p>
<p>Tongliang Paper Mill: Tongliang has always produced Sichuan Gong paper, sold throughout the country, and is famous domestically. However, due to a lack of improvement in production methods, sales have declined in recent years. All products of this factory are made by machine, and test runs have now been completed, preparing for official production and shipment. Products include white paper and glazed paper. Last month, the factory increased production of high-quality paper such as cigarette paper, tracing paper, and match paper.</p>
<p>Dachuan Industrial Company Needle Factory: Sponsored by Tai Tai, Yin Zhizhong, etc., relocated from Qingdao to Sichuan. Since relocating to Sichuan, they have been working to resume production. It has now started production and shipping goods, producing 500,000 large and small sewing needles per day. Other household needles and buttons can also be shipped, making it the only needle and button factory in the rear area.</p>
<p>Xingye Company Steel Department: Headed by Hu Guanglu, Xiao Wanwei, etc. The Bessemer steel furnace designed by the department has recently completed its trial run and will soon be in continuous production. The thirty-ton iron smelting furnace planned by them also started its trial run at the end of July, with excellent results.</p>
<p>Lijiatuo Water Supply Company: The chairman of the company is Lin Yong, and the manager is Xu. Water supply began on the 12th of last month. China Chemical Industrial Society: Relocated from Shanghai, managed by Li Zudi, and chemist Wang Xiuyin. Started work in the first ten days of last month, producing magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, toothpaste, mosquito coils, soap, and cosmetics.</p>

It recently started production in the middle of last month, producing 3,000 bags of flour per day, managed by Li Guowei. Although the above factories have started production and shipping goods separately, they are still actively seeking ways to increase daily production. However, many factories, although they have been relocated to their destinations in time, have not yet found addresses, but will soon start production and shipping goods.</p>
<h3>Concerns Expressed About the US Military's Withdrawal Preparations; It Is Generally Believed That the Work Performed by the US Military Is Important, and Security Arrangements Must Be Made Once They Leave</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt announced that the United States Marine Corps will withdraw from China. After this news spread, business people in the city felt deeply concerned. A well-known businessman pointed out that the troops stationed by the United States in Shanghai are the only real guarantee for Shanghai at present. They can undertake good work in maintaining order. If they withdraw, people may spread rumors. However, the authorities must have thorough plans for the security issue after the US Fourth Marine Corps leaves Shanghai, so there is no need to panic.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Merchants in Shanghai Donate Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Bian Ruixin of the Ningbo yarn industry in Shanghai, in view of the increasingly cold weather and soaring prices, making life difficult for the poor, specially made a grand wish to donate a large sum of money to purchase 600 sets of cotton clothing and 400 dan of corn. 300 sets of cotton clothing will be distributed in Shanghai and Ningbo respectively, and 100 sets will be donated by the Buddhist Benevolent Society Ningbo Congee Distribution Center in Ningbo.

In addition, 7,000 yuan will be donated to the Buddhist Benevolent Society Ningbo Congee Distribution Center as funds for congee and rice distribution.</p>
<h3>Curfew Measures to Be Tightened This Week</h3>
<p>According to news from the Public Concession工部局, residents in the concession have not paid much attention to the curfew order because the penalties are too light. Therefore, new penalty regulations are being re-drafted. In the future, anyone caught violating the curfew without a police pass during curfew hours will be subject to other more severe punishments in addition to detention. Strict enforcement will be implemented within this week.</p>

<h3>Sudden Death of US Financial Commissioner in Shanghai, Nicholson: A Commodity Valuation Expert Relied Upon by Both China and the United States</h3>
<p>Nicholson, the US government's representative in Shanghai and US Financial Commissioner, age 63, who had been living in Shanghai for 24 years, suddenly died of a heart attack in his office on Foch Road at 11:00 AM on Friday (the 7th).</p>
<p>The Consular Court Scheduled an Examination</p>
<p>The body has been moved to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. The US Consular Court, due to his sudden death, has scheduled an examination. It is reported that on the day of his death, Nicholson had dinner with friends at the Jinmen Hotel. He returned to the office at 10:30 to review the telegrams sent to the Department of the Treasury in Washington. At that time, the driver, Zhang, was sitting in another room when he suddenly heard the sound of a chair falling to the ground. He rushed to check and saw Mr. Nicholson lying stiff on the ground. Miss Jackson, Nicholson's confidential secretary, and Miss Griffin, a clerk, were just coming from outside, intending to help him send telegrams. Upon seeing the situation, they immediately called Dr. Cadena, but it was too late. At that time, Dr. Lambert, Mr. Daley, the US Treasury representative in Kobe, and Judge Loudon of the US Court in China were all notified to handle his affairs.</p>
<p>Many Contributions to Tariff Regulations</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson is survived by a brother and a niece. His brother is now in San Francisco, and his niece is in California. Mr. Nicholson was born in San Francisco on October 22, 1879. In 1897, he joined the US Customs Service and served as a customs appraiser in San Francisco for a long time, specializing in Eastern commodities. In September 1917, he came to Shanghai as a special commissioner, and later became a financial commissioner. Because he was a valuation expert, he was recalled to the United States when the US government formulated new tariff regulations. When China revised its tariff regulations, he was also appointed as an expert. He had extensive contacts with Chinese exporters and American importers.</p>
<h3>Police Accomplices Beat a Woman and Took Her to the Police Station</h3>
<p>Li Chen, a local woman residing at No. 7 Anlin Lane, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, age 41, was washing clothes at the tap at noon the day before yesterday when Chen Gengqing (age 25), who also lived there, came to wash rice. Li accidentally dripped dirty water into Chen's rice, causing Chen to scold her loudly. After mediation, Chen went upstairs, intending to return to his room. Unexpectedly, while walking halfway up the stairs, Wang Jiaohui, a patrolman No. 1024 (age 28) who also lived in the house and worked for the French police, came down the stairs and met Chen. Without asking the reason, Wang pulled Chen into the pavilion room. At that time, Chen Gengqing also arrived. The two tightly closed the door and beat Chen severely, causing serious injuries. At that time, a resident reported to the police station, and the police arrested all the above people and took them to the police station. After questioning by the chief, Wang Jiaohui was charged with being an illegal civil servant who committed violence without reason and was ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Kidnapping of a University Student Was Masterminded by a Classmate, and the Criminal Has Been Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhao Dianyao, a student at Great China University, was kidnapped by bandits on the morning of October 7 last year while going to school from home, passing the intersection of Nanyang Road and Hartung Road. A large ransom was demanded. Zhao later took advantage of the bandits' laxity and escaped. Subsequently, the Public Concession police captured many of the bandits involved in the case, who were interrogated and sentenced by the Special First Court. It has now been found by Zhao Lianbi, Yang Zhaoqing, and Wang Zhenfei, detectives of the Central Police Station, that the kidnapping of Zhao Dianyao was masterminded by Zhang Yousheng (also known as Zhang Jiajun, Zhou Luming), a classmate from Great China University. Because Zhang had been to Zhao's house, he knew the situation of his family very well. Therefore, he colluded with the bandits to kidnap him. After the detectives made every effort to investigate, they arrested Zhang at the Dongchang Hotel, No. 4 Lane 398, Xiafei Road, together with the French police. At the same time, Zhang Dongping, also from Jiangbei, was also arrested and sent to the Criminal Division of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case, requesting permission for detention for further investigation, as the case still needs investigation. Zhang Yousheng confessed to the crime of instigating the kidnapping of Zhao Dianyao without denial. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and ordered him to be detained for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>After Leaving a Wedding Banquet, He Was Suddenly Sniped at Upon Leaving, Wang Chunting Was Shot in the Back, and the Wedding Car Sent Him to the Hospital</h3>
<p>Pang Yongnian, from Wuxing, is an employee of the Meikang Silk Weaving Factory at No. 80 Lane 810, Jiaozhou Road, West Shanghai. He got married at the Laobanzhai Restaurant at No. 96 Hankou Road yesterday. Men and women were mixed together, and it was very lively. Around 8 PM, as the wine was running low and the guests were thanking each other, it turned out that a friend named Wang Chunting, 29 years old, a local, residing at a certain address on Binlang Road, had just stepped out of the restaurant and walked a few steps when someone lying in ambush on the side of the road, without asking the reason, took out a pistol and fired a shot at him. The shot hit him in the back, but the bullet did not penetrate. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately fled with the weapon without a trace. After being injured, Wang was still able to support himself because he was young and strong. He returned to the restaurant, went upstairs, and reported the sniping situation to the host. Yongnian urgently used the wedding car to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Laoza Gate police station, ordering detectives to investigate. However, Wang claimed to be an inspector at the Meikang Silk Factory, but Meikang denied his employment. As for Wang's sniping this time, it may be related to a labor dispute.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Negotiations Resolved at the British Public Bus Company</h3>
<p>The workers in the car and engine departments (including drivers, conductors, coppersmiths, etc.) of the British Public Bus Company in the city have recently found it difficult to make a living due to the sharp rise in prices. Therefore, they specially requested the company's authorities to increase subsidies. After days of negotiations between labor and management, a satisfactory solution has been reached. Starting this month, all workers will receive an additional living allowance of 6 jiao 5 fen in legal tender per day from the company, combined with the original daily allowance, totaling 2 yuan in legal tender. It will also be paid retroactively on the 8th of this month. All workers expressed their satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Jewish-Owned Cinema Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>Two months ago, the employees of various cinemas in the city requested the employers to increase their salaries and subsidies in order to maintain their livelihood. After several rounds of negotiations between labor and management, a solution was reached. While the Chinese cinemas have come to an end, there are still several foreign-owned cinemas that have not yet reached a result and have been delayed until now. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, the employees have raised the issue again, requesting a solution. Therefore, the employees of the Jewish-owned Zhejiang, Lafayette, and Guanglu cinemas went on strike the day before yesterday. The issue was still not resolved yesterday. The above-mentioned cinemas remained closed, and the loss was not small. The labor side still insisted on a universal increase of 20 yuan. It is also reported that a labor dispute occurred at the Rongjin Grand Theater on Labor Father Road yesterday morning, resulting in a one-day closure. It is heard that the labor-management relationship at the Almond Grand Theater on Taiping Bridge and Brier Road is harmonious, and the special subsidy of 20 yuan per person has already been issued.</p>

<p>Let's Talk about Electric Lights First</p>
<p>Fluorescent lamps are an interesting invention in the modern scientific world, and because they are very consistent with economic principles and very practical, they are quite popular. However, because the company to which they belong wants to monopolize the account, they often do not consider making its structure public to the public, so it is worth studying. We will first talk about electric lights. Electric lights are divided into two types: with filament and without filament. Filament electric lights use electric current to pass through a resistor, which generates heat and emits light. The first inventor of this electric light was Edison, who used sewing thread in 1879, which was refined through scientific methods and used as a filament, but its nature was too fragile and easily burned, so the results were not good. After several improvements, after changing to metal, it was not until 1907 that it was known to use tungsten filament. In 1911, it made even more progress. It was to draw the tungsten filament into a thin filament and install it in the lamp. This kind of filament is not easily damaged. The bulb is vacuum, because if there is air stored in between, the electric light will emit light, which will cause oxidation, and the filament will be damaged in an instant. After repeated improvements in 1913, it was known that some stable gases can be placed in the bulb to make it a considerable vacuum, called gas-filled tungsten filament lamp. This lamp can accommodate more power watts than the former. The filament lamp used today also belongs to this type.</p>
<p>Filamentless Electric Light</p>
<p>The progress of filament lamps is extremely rapid, but on the other hand, the development of filamentless electric lamps cannot be underestimated. The light emission of filamentless electric lamps is based on the discharge effect, that is, the cathode emits electrons, and when it meets a certain gas, the electrons scatter the atoms of the gas, and then repeatedly restore them, resulting in an excited state. In this state, the gas emits light. In the fifteenth century, this research was quite popular. It was not until 1893 that Morel made some contributions to this. In 1904, in the United States, electric lights were made according to the above principles. In 1910, the British Crockett used gases such as neon and argon to make filamentless lamps, which are also the neon lights seen on the market today. As for the colors they present, they vary depending on the gas stored in the lamp. For example, if the stored gas is neon, the color is red, and if it is argon, the color is yellow. The fluorescent lamp is of the same type as the above. The difference is that the above gas lamps emit light directly from the gas, while fluorescent lamps emit light indirectly.</p>
<p>It Has Already Existed</p>
<p>In fact, the invention of fluorescent lamps dates back to 1866, but it was only preliminary. It was not until 1933 that an electrical company in the United States successfully produced a fluorescent lamp after research. The results were quite good. There are filaments on both ends of the tube (but these filaments are not used for emitting light). Both ends belong to the cathode, because the positive and negative electrodes of the AC power source are interchanging and are not fixed, so both ends of the lamp can absorb the negative electrons of the AC power source. In addition, the inside of the glass tube is also equipped with a mercury tube, and the inside is coated with chemical powder. The composition of this powder is still under study because the patentee strictly keeps it secret. In addition, the lamp also has three important parts, namely rectifier trigger and capacitor. Mr. Qiu explained the physical, chemical, engineering, and mechanical parts of the fluorescent lamp one by one, describing them in detail. Unfortunately, the blackboard reflected light, and the audience could not see most of the terms written on the board. As for the fact that the light of fluorescent lamps is not completely the same as the real sunlight, there are many differences. According to the test results, the sunlight on a cloudless sunny day in July contains various pigments, which is different from fluorescent lamps. The most obvious thing is that fluorescent lamps contain too much blue and too little red, so the fluorescent lamps seen on the market are always different from sunlight. In addition, today's fluorescent lamps often have flashes, which have a significant impact on eye health. In short, fluorescent lamps still need our further research and improvements.</p>

<h3>Mini-Soccer Charity Match: Ruitang Wins 3-2 Over Aurora University; Huamei Defeats Mighty Lions 2-1</h3>
<p>In the charitable mini-soccer charity match organized by the Catholic Orphanage yesterday afternoon, Huamei defeated the Mighty Lions 2-1, avenging the shame of the Black Man Cup charity match. Ruitang narrowly defeated Aurora University 3-2. At the beginning of the game, Mighty Lions' He Jiatong shot from about 20 yards and hit the goal. In less than three minutes, Huamei's Chen Dongbing violated the rules. Referee Wei Shipai judged a foul, and He Jiatong took the penalty kick, but unfortunately he did not hit the goal. In the first half, Mighty Lions took the lead 1-0. After switching sides, Huamei worked hard to counterattack. Han Longhai went straight to the goal, lying down and reflecting the ball, and sure enough, he hit the goal, making it 1-1. After 15 minutes, Huamei's Sun Lufang passed the ball through the defense and lightly passed the ball to Cao Wenhu, who shot from 15 yards into the left corner. Huamei then defeated Mighty Lions 2-1, coming from behind. Ruitang and Aurora University took the stage. In the 5th minute, Aurora University's Wang Xisheng committed a foul, and Xiao Ziwen took a 9-yard penalty kick, which hit the goal. In a few seconds, Aurora University's Wu Wei fouled again for a 9-yard penalty kick. Ruitang's Xuan Shenghua took the penalty kick but failed. In the first half, Ruitang took the lead 1-0. In the second half, Yan Meixiang led his team to attack. He shot fiercely in the penalty area and scored, pulling back a goal. After 17 minutes, Ye Yiting took the opportunity to advance and shot a cannonball, but unfortunately the ball hit the left post and bounced out. Yi Shenghua took the opportunity to pull back a goal. After three or four weeks of back and forth, Aurora University's Yan Xingxiang attacked alone. Hu Hanwen miscalculated, and the goal was broken again, making it a tense situation of 2-2. In less than a minute before the end of the game, Ruitang's Cao Qinfang made a contribution on the border, and then secured the victory with 3-2. The authorities announced that they plan to invite the Ruitang and Aurora University teams again this week for another match to help with income and expenditure. The lineups for yesterday's game are as follows: (Huamei) Han Longgen, Chen Dongjing, Chen Guansheng, Han Longquan, Jiang Yanli, Sun Zili, Han Longhai, Cao Wenfu (Mighty Lions) Li Zuomin, Pan Honghai, Lu Penglin, Xia Pangjiwen, Shang He Jiatong, Tang Genchu, Xiao Ziwen, Qian Zuzi, Xu Guangming (Ruitang) Gu Biao, Chen Xian, Hu Hanwen, Lin Dianzhang, Xuan Shenghua, Xiao Ziwen, Cao Qinfang, Ye Yiting, Liu Shaolin, Wang Xisheng, Wu Xie, Yan Xingxiang, Xing Guozhi, Ke Luoruifu, Chen Daye</p>

<h3>Yu Cheng Wins the Jingwu Cup Individual Table Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>The runner-up was Li Zhen, and the third place was Li Guangyao. The Jingwu Sports Association organized the third member individual table tennis championship, and the authorities specially made a large silver cup, named the Jingwu Cup. More than ten people participated in this competition. The previous two champions, Zhang Mei and Rong Deneng, and famous players such as Ouyang Wei, in order to increase the interest of the generals in winning the championship, all gave up participating. Qi Shi, a hardball master, Weng Zhichao, withdrew halfway due to work reasons, which is a pity. After more than two months of round-robin battles, the two new players Yu Cheng and Li Zhen won the right to the final with a full victory record. The championship match was held in the club's ball room at 8 PM last night. Yu is an outstanding player among the up-and-comers, with both offense and defense. Li is good at chopping balls, which is unusually stable. When the two met, Yu hit hard head-on, and his shots were like continuous beads, which was even more fierce. Although Li saved a lot of dangerous balls, he was defeated in the first game by a score of two points. The courage of the big hall had an impact, and he did not become discouraged. He lost three games in a row. Yu cheered up and accumulated points. Except for the first game, which was more intense, the other two games were won without much effort. As a result, Yu Cheng defeated Li Zhen with a straight victory to win the championship, and Li came in second. The third place was won by Li Guangyao. After the game, Liang Jintang, the head of the recreation section of the association, gave a speech and presented awards. The champions and runners-up each received a large silver cup, the third place received a silver medal, and the other winners each received a bronze medal.</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Xu Case: Improving Family Life</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The recent Xu case has shocked society, and the public is deeply concerned about its development. All the details have been recorded elsewhere, so there is no need to repeat them here, as they fall outside the scope of this publication. However, from a family perspective, and to proactively promote progress so that families can enjoy reasonable and fulfilling lives, I would like to discuss the importance of marriage, the responsibilities of husbands, the value of maternal education, and the true worth of money.</p>
<p>The close relationship between the family and each of us is self-evident, because regardless of location, social class, or wealth, everyone has a home. We spend at least two-thirds of our lives at home, yet many people fail to plan for this significant portion of their lives, making life more meaningful. This is regrettable.</p>
<p>Of course, during our childhood, under the care of our parents, we cannot talk about improving the family. But when we reach the age of marriage, we should consider the most important aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>Marriage is an art. As Ibsen once said, successful marriage is based on mutual sincerity, freedom, and wisdom. When a person steps onto the altar, they assume a great responsibility to society. They must examine the positive traits they have inherited from their parents, and whether they possess special strengths that they can pass on to their children, making them useful individuals. Many great figures, writers, and scientists who have gone down in history have inherited positive qualities from their fathers or mothers.</p>
<p>Husbands often say that they must focus on their careers to address economic issues. This view is understandable, but a person's responsibilities do not end with solving economic problems. Exchanging labor and effort for appropriate compensation is work, something everyone can and will do, which may not be a great contribution to society, but also cannot be said to be without merit. Husbands must devote considerable energy to organizing the family in a healthy and rational manner. This, too, is being human, and the degree to which it is done well will determine a person's character. We must first know how to be a person before we can talk about how to work. Focusing solely on money and not on society means we will have lived our lives in vain.</p>
<p>Of course, wives have the same responsibilities. Bearing and raising children is something all creatures can do. Even the lowliest beings can produce offspring. However, what distinguishes humans is the ability to educate and nurture. If Edison had not had his mother, he might have become a vagrant child. President Roosevelt, through his mother's education, became a world-renowned figure. However, his mother did not hope for him to become wealthy or powerful, but simply to become an outstanding citizen. Therefore, Edison's mother is glorious, and President Roosevelt's mother is happy.</p>
<p>China has traditionally valued maternal education. The stories of Mencius's mother, Yue Fei's mother, and Ouyang Xiu's mother are known to almost everyone. Even watching Peking Opera and local operas, one can see many plays about educating children. Teaching children is naturally not easy; early childhood education is a science. There are many books on child education available for a few coins, yet many parents are too lazy to educate their children, thereby harming their families and hindering social progress. In reality, educating our children to become pillars of society is merely fulfilling our basic duty. However, if we can go a step further and cultivate numerous talents for society, we can be said to have provided a tangible service to society. Father Flanagan in America, who founded Boys Town, and Mrs. Edna Gladney, who founded the Children's Home and Aid Society, are admirable for their unwavering dedication to practical work.</p>
<p>To have valuable wisdom, one must first have ample knowledge. But knowledge can be acquired at any time. In Europe and America, there are many self-made entrepreneurs who seek to enrich themselves at a certain stage, enabling them to write articles, deliver inspiring speeches, and move in academic circles. Hence the saying, "Life begins at forty." Because by the age of forty, one has sufficient life experience. Past mistakes can be corrected, and one can seek to do something beneficial for society. This is a golden age. Those who are already wealthy can think of the poor and distribute their wealth, thus understanding the true value of money. Their spirits will be happy and peaceful.</p>
<p>General families often have numerous problems, but if they are not improved, the same problems will persist ten years later. For our own happiness and the future of our nation, we cannot help but loudly urge everyone to pay attention to the issue of improving family life.</p>
<p>My Family Problem</p>
<h3>Essay Contest Announcement 6: Stepchild</h3>
<p>— Tuo</p>
<p>"Stepchild" is a name full of bitterness. Because of this name, there is an indescribable suffering in my family.</p>
<p>My mother and that "father" (my stepfather) often quarrel, and in the end, she is always suppressed. Her only hope is to look at me, silently, as if trying to find something in me. Once, I was standing alone by the window, watching five or six pigeons playing together, when I suddenly felt a warmth on the back of my head. I turned around and saw my mother quietly staring at me, lost in thought. When I turned around, our eyes met. Although I did not say a word, I understood perfectly. My mother always stares at me silently. I am afraid of her doing that, because I know that when she does, she is thinking of my late father.</p>
<p>Now that I am growing up, I know shame. I am afraid of seeing people because I am a stepchild. Sometimes when guests see me, they say to my stepfather, "Brother, you are truly blessed, your son is so big." At this, he simply nods slightly. At that moment, I feel indescribably, utterly embarrassed, as if I have nowhere to turn. But what else can I do? I know the pain in my heart is something ordinary people cannot understand. I am afraid to be with him. Even when we are together, we do not often laugh or talk. I do not even want to look at him. I believe he knows this, and I also believe that the reason he often quarrels with my mother may be because of me, though sometimes it is for other reasons, which he can then use as an excuse. Writing this, tears well up in my heart because I am truly sorry for my mother. Because she did not want to abandon me, because of my life and future, she endured all the suffering and insults to remarry, and after marrying, she secretly cried for me, sighed for me, and was bossed around like an ox or a horse, while also being looked down upon and bullied by many in society as if she were a promiscuous woman... Oh, I cannot write anymore because my heart feels like a sick person at the moment of death, so painful. My hand is trembling, and my head is gradually spinning. I cannot bear it anymore. I need to rest for a while. (Ten yuan for manuscript fee, full-year subscription to Family Monthly)</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>I sympathize with Tuo's plight. However, in this new era, the term "stepchild" should no longer exist. Since Tuo knows his mother's suffering, he should strive for progress and not show a despondent attitude. When he can make a great contribution to society in the future, no one will ever say that he is a stepchild.</p>
<p>Generally, people also look down on orphans without parents. However, the American hero Andrew Jackson was an orphan, and former British Prime Minister Lloyd George was also an orphan.</p>
<p>Everyone born into this world belongs to all of humanity. They are part of humanity, and they should enjoy the rights that humans are entitled to, and they should also fulfill the obligations that humans must fulfill. I hope Tuo will remember these words.</p>

<h3>One Week of Home-Style Recipes Ms. Hua Ying</h3>
<p>Last week, I mentioned stir-fried crab roe, which is indeed something I love to eat. However, simply stir-fried crab roe feels a bit too luxurious. For economic reasons, I have to think carefully. If I want to eat crab roe while being thrifty, I naturally have to consider complementary ingredients. A more economical option is to add tofu and make a crab roe tofu soup. Other options include stir-fried crab roe with vegetables, stir-fried crab roe with cellophane noodles, and stir-fried crab roe with shepherd's purse, which are all much more economical than simply stir-fried crab roe, while still having good flavor. However, you can't do without lard when stir-frying. Stir-frying cellophane noodles especially requires more lard to make them rich and delicious, and this is something you can't skimp on.</p>
<p>Monday: Celery stir-fried with shredded pork, dried scallops with radish, shrimp stir-fried with gluten, spinach soup</p>
<p>Tuesday: Soybean sprouts with beef, crab roe tofu soup, scallion broad beans, pan-fried golden pomfret</p>
<p>Wednesday: Steamed minced meat cake, vinegar-glazed yellow croaker, stewed tofu with vegetables, plain stir-fried garland chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Thursday: Beef stir-fried with cellophane noodles, dried shrimp and meat stew, stir-fried greens, braised radish slices</p>

<p>Heavenly Kitchen Recipes (80)</p>
<p>Last issue, this column featured Sun Mingjing's recipe for crab roe lion's head meatballs.</p>
<p>The method is very unique, but I have done some research on the meat used and the cutting method for crab roe lion's head meatballs, and I am recording it below. Preparation: Fresh meat, Chinese cabbage, MSG, refined salt, cooking wine, scallions, water chestnut flour, lard, vegetable oil. Method: Prepare four or five female crabs (because female crabs have more roe), they don't have to be very large. Select about half a catty of fresh pork that is 60% lean and 40% fat, and four or five heads of Chinese cabbage (preferably all cabbage hearts). After cooking the crabs, peel out the crab meat and set it aside. Mince the fresh meat, the meat should be finely sliced and coarsely minced, too fine and it won't be flavorful enough. When mincing, remove the tendons from the meat. After mincing, add the crab roe and meat to a large bowl, add an appropriate amount of MSG, refined salt, chopped scallions, ginger, cooking wine, and water chestnut flour, and mix well. Then use a wine cup to cover the meat, making it into a round meatball. Then put it in a lard pan and fry until both sides are slightly yellow. Use another vegetable oil pan (not too much, because the meatball already has oil), pour in the cabbage heart and stir-fry. When it is cooked, use a spatula to flatten the cabbage heart, and place the meatballs on top of the cabbage heart one by one. Cover and braise for 20 minutes. The umami of the crab meatball will all flow into the cabbage heart. The yellow crab oil floats on the surface, its deliciousness is truly unparalleled. Gentlemen: If you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and oil, salt, medicine, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special delivery person will be sent immediately, without charging a delivery fee.</p>

<h3>I Hope Everyone Reflects</h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>Before Mr. I.S. Dungan left Shanghai, I spoke with him about the issue of food and price controls in Shanghai. When I mentioned the unstoppable rise in rice prices, Mr. Dungan sighed and seemed deeply concerned. He said: To solve various difficulties, citizens must rise up and cooperate with the authorities.</p>
<p>We will not talk about the merchants who manipulate and hoard goods, and arbitrarily raise prices for the moment. Now, I would like everyone to calmly and quietly self-examine: Whether directly or indirectly, have you "contributed" to the rise in prices.</p>
<p>Of course, one person buying an extra pack of matches, or buying three extra bars of soap, does not seem to pose a serious problem for the overall price level in Shanghai. But everyone must understand that we live a collective social life. One becomes ten, ten becomes a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a million... how can such a large Shanghai not undergo a significant change?</p>
<p>Ordinary "non-professional" merchants – meaning those who do not normally engage in business – hoard various goods through various means in order to sell them at a good price. Their mentality is that everyone is doing this, so why can't I? If others can make money, why should I be the exception? Thus, regardless of the amount of capital, as long as the market has not run out of goods, they always feel that unlimited hope is just around the corner.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will reflect on themselves: Although I cannot suppress prices and stabilize them, have I contributed in any way to the rise in prices?</p>
<h3>Opening a Rice Shop to Sell Rice at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have a matter on which I would like to seek your advice.</p>
<p>Recently, the financial situation in Shanghai has been chaotic, and prices have risen sharply. The price of rice, oil, salt, and firewood is increasing day and night. Ordinary poor people, or middle and lower class salary earners, are all crying out in distress. I am heartbroken by what I see, but helpless to remedy it. I have been racking my brains, unable to sleep or eat. In the spirit of helping myself and others, I plan to take action. I intend to invite a few close friends, pool together 3,000 yuan, and open a small rice shop, specializing in purchasing cheap rice from the Public Works Department and selling it to ordinary people at a limited price in the store. However, I have no commercial knowledge, and I am unsure whether this is feasible. Therefore, I respectfully seek your advice on the following five matters:</p>
<p>(1) Can specializing in selling cheap rice cover daily expenses, such as rent and food costs?</p>
<p>(2) What procedures are required to obtain a rice shop license?</p>
<p>(3) Is 3,000 yuan of capital sufficient?</p>
<p>(4) Can the Public Works Department guarantee a steady supply of cheap rice?</p>
<p>(5) What procedures are required to purchase rice from the Public Works Department? I wish you good health! Xiong Chuxin sincerely</p>
<p>Editor's Reply:</p>
<p>(1) Selling cheap rice has a handling fee to earn (approximately 10 yuan per stone).</p>
<p>(2) The same as a regular business license.</p>
<p>(3) 3,000 yuan is insufficient. Because all the shop's equipment and capital is not light to set up at present.</p>
<p>(4) A steady supply can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>(5) Registered individuals can request this from the authorities (handled by the Lichiji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road Bund). After the application is approved, pay the fee (劃頭) and collect the rice. Observing your intention, which is mainly to serve, it may be better to inquire with the authorities and discuss how to proceed with the current "Cheap Rice Sales Outlets" or more suitable matters.</p>
<h3>More on Hartung</h3>
<p>— Yifan</p>
<p>Recently, the matter of the distribution of Hartung's estate after the death of Ms. Luo Jialing has attracted attention in Shanghai society. A sum of 800 million yuan is not small! In addition to the adopted children of the Hartung couple claiming inheritance rights, it has also caused the "eyes" of many people to turn "red". We can watch this inheritance lawsuit unfold.</p>
<p>Hartung was a British Jewish man. Jews have a special skill for doing business and accumulating wealth! The spirit of hard work of the Jews is generally admirable. However, their attitude toward life still needs to be improved.</p>
<p>When we pass along the long Jing'an Temple Road, we are almost entirely walking on Hartung's property. Part of the police force, maintained by taxes paid by citizens of the Public Concession! That is, the security on Jing'an Temple Road - is almost entirely set up to protect Hartung's private property. In all fairness, the security in the Jing'an Temple Road area should be borne by Hartung. However, the Public Works Department has no way to achieve this goal, only to share it. Some say that in the western section of Jing'an Temple Road, there are still rural-style houses that are not connected, because Hartung is deeply afraid of increasing tax obligations. Several years ago, the Public Works Department discussed with Hartung's wife about improving traffic at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road and wanted to purchase Hartung's land. In the end, it was abandoned because Hartung's demands were too harsh. Those of us in Shanghai who pass by that area will not find it difficult to experience the traffic situation there. During the Fifth Great War, the Public Works Department specially asked Hartung to donate to the Red Cross. Hartung</p>
<p>Hartung did not make any major contributions to Shanghai during his lifetime, but Shanghai was the birthplace and paradise for Hartung's fortune. Hartung, a Jew, is already dead. Hartung's adopted children are still alive, how will they manage the aftermath?</p>
<h3>Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>— Yaoyao</p>
<p>A: "It's such a shame, I fired that typist."</p>
<p>B: "Is business not so good?"</p>
<p>A: "No, because I'm too busy, I don't have time to play."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fourteen: Living the Life of a Stuntman</p>
<p>According to his own plan, now that he was going to the Red Stage, Qian Ruomo had already informed Xiao Jiqing not to mention his past. Backstage, he would use the alias Wu Sanxi. When it was time to perform, his face would be painted. No matter how good someone's memory was or how sharp their eyes were, they would never think that he was Begonia. In this way, the issue of identity was resolved! Next was the issue of physical strength. He remembered that several of his fellow apprentices had gradually become stuntmen because they couldn't find roles. They didn't seem to be too tired. At most, they had two action scenes a day, and not every action scene required a big fight. Sometimes, they would only thrust a few spears or swing a few swords, and that was it. Although his skills had deteriorated over the years, he couldn't be so useless that he couldn't even handle that. Not showing anything. He only donated fifty silver dollars to the Red Cross before leaving.</p>
<p>But the next night, when he tried it out at the Red Stage, he was so exhausted that he barely had the strength to walk home.</p>
<p>Because it was his first day on stage, he was naturally extra attentive. He arrived backstage at 6:50 PM. The stunt manager was very polite to him. Because Xiao Jiqing had given special instructions the night before, he personally led him around backstage, introducing him to all the managers and the second- and third-tier actors in the troupe.
