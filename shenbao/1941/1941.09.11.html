<h3>美所接收丹麥货船　在水島海外被擊沉　華盛頓國務院已正式宣布　西沙號船員二十四人喪生</h3>
<p>合衆社十日華盛頓急電　國務院昨日午後獲悉、美國所管之巴拿馬輪船「西沙號」、八月十七日在冰島海外被魚雷所擊沉、船昌廿四名喪生、包括美國人一名、餘生者三名、於九月八日獲救、此間非官方人士消息稱、最近在紅海被擊沉之美國貨船「鋼水手」號於被炸時、燈火燃明、並有標示美國之火炬、該「西沙」號之唯一美籍船員、爲一無綫電生、名莫罕默德、年四十四、該輪之船員有愛爾蘭人一名、丹麥人七名、挪威人二名、瑞典人二名、冰島人二名、葡萄牙人五名、比利時人一名、英國人五名、西班牙人一名及船主丹麥人尼爾生、國務院宣布稱、該「西沙」號係運載糧食·榖類·木材及其他普通貨品、並無軍火或戰爭軍械、該批貨物係冰島致府所有、國務院關於「西沙」號被沉之布吿、原文稱、一海軍部於九月六日晨通知國務院稱、海軍部於冰島西南海外的約三百哩地方、救起「西沙」號之餘生船員三名、其他船員二十叫名諒已喪生、國務院獲悉、該餘生者言該船係八月十七日被魚雷所擊沉、船員中有美國人一名、姓氏未明、亦非餘生者之一、至該獲救者三人之姓名、國務院亦未獲通知、「西沙」號前爲一丹麥輪、於最近准許接收美國領海內賦閒之外國貨船之法案下、由丹麥政府得來者、該輪係在巴拿馬註冊、當日係運載冰島政府之接濟物品往冰島、該批貨品包括糧食·榖類材料暨其他普通貨物、並無軍火」某國務院發言人稱、該輪係由美國航務委員會所接收、此决航程中、乃紐的某公司所管理云、</p>
<p>合衆社十日華盛頓電負責官員宜布、美國之戰爭威脅、已自太平洋轉移至大西洋、並謂德國或係對海洋航務採取無限制之戰爭、彼等並引美國船艦格里埃號、西沙號及鋼水手號之被擊沉事件以爲證、</p>
<p>國際社十日紅海某港電美貨船「鋼水手」號所有軍官及士兵三十六名、昨在此問安然登陸、據稱、當轟炸機擊沉該艦時、該艦及美旗均淸晰可見、遇救者均不能認明該機、惟均指爲「德國」云、</p>
<p>華盛頓政界騷動　認德將拖美參戰</p>
<p>台衆社十日華盛頓電　些間政界內最近美輪剛艘相機遭受襲擊、昨引起騷動、並認爲邱吉爾氏所警吿納粹對美大西洋巡暹路綫之行動一致之可能攻擊一語、足以採取非常嚴重之態度、此間以前一般均認爲希特勒將避免對美國船隻之襲擊、蓋恐引起美國之憤怒、然今日若干方面相信、希特勒於橫行無忌中或將授命襲擊重蹈一九一七年德皇之覆轍、希特勒固認識此舉或將捲美國於戰爭也、</p>
<p>合衆社十日華盛頓電美國所管之巴拿馬註册貨船「西沙」號被擊沉消息、適與邱吉爾所稱希特勒或將擴大戰爭至美洲之警告相吻台、奧克拉賀馬省民主黨議員湯姆斯稱、「因格里埃事件之結果、美國已承諾予英以更大之海軍援助」、國務卿赫爾於報界會議中稱、該「西沙」號雖掛巴拿馬旗、然爲美國之公司所管、赫爾稱、主使襲擊「西沙」號者、吾人可無疑惑、惟渠於接獲較多報吿以後、始肯予以討論、「西沙」號被擊沉之宜布係繼「鋼水手」號在蘇彝士河口被炸沉之宣布以後、此爲格里埃號事件後之四十八小時、事態之發展、加强一種信心，即美國海軍將在美國領海內以武力對付武力、向德國任何企圖切斷英國接濟路綫之攻擊挑戰云、</p>
<p>美政策正在轉變　決確保海上航道</p>
<p>路透社十日華盛頓電　現有理由可信、美船「鋼水手」號與「西沙」號之爲德方所擊沉、與美艦格里埃號之遭德方攻擊、刻正促使美國政策轉變、此間認為「四沙」號之沉失、較其他兩事件更爲重要、「西沙」號懸巴拿馬旗幟一點、未必改變美國之反響、因該船乃美國所有、正從巴拿馬改向美國登號也、各方對於「西沙」號沉失之消息何故久不發表一層、頗多揣測、據路透社所聞、上星期四日氷島美陸戰隊無綫電台曾　　西沙」號愆期未到、恐已遭魚雷襲擊之消息、英、美無綫電台似均未收得此訊、故國務院昨日宣布此船沉失、聞者爲之震觸、衆意此訊所以不早予發表者、乃欲待接獲脫險船員之詳報也、路透社聞諸可靠方面、羅斯福總統原擬於星期一夜播音中宜布沉失事、因喪母、展至星期四日廣播、屆時總統諒將答復邱吉爾所發續予海軍援助之呼籲、實則邱吉爾在未發此呼籲時、已獲答復、蓋總統之廣播演詞稿早已擬就、而定星期一日發表也、聞總統於播音中將說明由於納粹攻擊美船之故、大西洋巡邏政策將予變更、消息靈通人士相信、羅斯福總統將宜佈美國與冰島聞莫可侵犯之海上航道、而在此道上發現任何有敵意的軍艦即予以消滅、質言之、任何德方潛艇水面船隻或飛機、入此區對將冒立遭美海軍摧毀之險、縱僅侵入此區、亦將視爲敵對行動、而加以摧毀、此海上航道之闊度、尙未可知、但可猜定此航道將有充足之闊度、以保障運英接濟品在美國與冰島間之絕對安全、</p>
<p>衆院外委會主席　主張廢除中立法</p>
<p>路透社十日華盛頓電　據消息雲通方面之可靠傳說、羅斯福總統明日之演說中、將要求德國對於內納粹行動而造成之美國船雙及生命損失、予以嚴密之注意據稱、美方因上述原因而損失之船隻共計五艘、美國人民之遇難者、至少當有六十五人、聞美總統現仍從事於此項演辭之草擬、此間對於總統或將宣布任何行動、以實現美國海上權利之被尊重雖尙無消息可得、但以爲總統之將明白表示、美國堅持海洋自由主義、自少疑義、衆曉外交委員會主席勃羅姆宜稱、束縛吾人援英之中立法案、應予以廢除云、</p>
<h3>美國務卿邀集　遠東專家會談　預籌將來對日政策</h3>
<p>國際社十日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨日召集其遠東事務主　顧問、開重要會議、同時美國正等待日本宣布其允於明日宣布之「重大決定」該項決定、將影響日本之作戰政策、衆信赫爾所召開之會議、目的在於預籌對策、萬一近衛之宣言使日、美間太平洋關係更趨緊張，如何應付、然亦有人以爲、近衛或將發表、日本政策業經改變、以美·日和睦爲原則、甚或背離軸心、亦未可知、正値赫爾召開會議之際、美國關稅委員會公布日貨輸美詳細調查表、證明此項貿易若完全停頓、對於美國國防程序或國家前途、絕無影響、</p>
<h3>豐田樞密院　解釋美日談判</h3>
<p>合衆社十日東京電　可靠方頷宣稱、豐田外相本日在樞密院解釋歐洲局勢時、曾透露現時日·美間之修好談判、觀察家察覺日·美官員及商界對於日·美修好有成功之可能、已漸表樂觀、日本報紙似亦盡力提倡、故皆已停止發表反美評論、</p>
<p>合衆社十日華盛頓電　國際方面昨接得報吿、謂若干主要人均信德國已不能在此次戰爭中獲勝、因此日本企圖减輕與軸心國之關係、而在可能範圍內、迅速增强與英·美之邦交、以盡力「挽救自己之面子」、但此報吿並未表明日本將公開或正式與軸心國決裂、據該報吿稱、此舉將極危險、恐將引起嚴重之內部反響也、東京發言人之批評謂、若美國能恢復運油至日本、則日本亦不反對美國運油至蘇聯、此舉即說明日將與美調整國交一例、靈通界推測首相近衛最近之宣言、似將對日本人之表示謂、美·日二國已開始談判、以改進二國間之關係、衆認爲此種談判係屬「試探性質」、在於尋求途徑、使日本於當前之困境中、獲得「光榮」之退路、據稱、日本以後或將放棄軸心、允以蘇聯之抵抗依然頑强也、</p>
<p>合衆社十日東京電　美童公學董事會本日集會、討論淸算該校、結果議決仍然佔用現時之校舍、但本學期將暫緩開學、此舉反影日·美修好漸有希望</p>
<h3>美鐵路工人　醖欀罷工　參加者近百萬人</h3>
<p>路透社十日華盛頓電　上星期五日鐵路工會十九處之領袖、曾奉命發動罷工、其中非機械人員工會共有會員約九十萬人、已定星期四日爲罷工日期、機械人員工會五處共三十五萬人、則定九月十五日罷工、彼等要求增加工資、據鐵路勞工法之規定、凡有上項情形發生時、羅期福總統須指派一調查委會、於一個月內呈報、故工會方面所定之罷工日期、未必即爲眞正停止工作之日、因在調查委會呈報後之三十日內、不能發動合法之罷工也、羅總統大約今日返京後、即將遴選此項委員、</p>
<h3>協約軍完成任務　退出斯畢茨柏根島　島上居民不遺一人　所有煤礦悉遭破壞</h3>
<p>路透社十日倫敦電　官塲宜佈、遠征斯畢茨柏根羣島之英協的軍巳安然返英、而該羣島已不留可供敵用之物、協的軍在期舉茨柏根羣島作短時間勾留時、已摧毀煤礦、內包括十五萬噸之存煤、並搗毀以有價値情報供給德方之無綫電臺一，座、島上居民已全體撇退、不遺一人、當加拿大軍乘小艇在該島登陸時、有一招待委員會迎之、投以大批糖菓與紙烟、島上居民旋即襄助加軍從事破壞工作</p>
<p>合衆社十日柏林電　德國權威界咋日評論英軍在斯畢茨柏根登陸之事稱、「吾人謹祝其在彼處穩渡冬季、」此外別無他言動合法之罷工也、羅總統大約今日返京後、即將遴選此項委員、</p>
<h3>特夫古柏　抵新加坡　將往游緬澳荷印</h3>
<p>路透社十日新加坡電　英戰爭內閣遠東特別代表特夫古柏、昨日抵此、據稱、日本之熱度縱未降低、但其動率似已轉緩、此乃頗可欣慰者云、據路透社探悉、美國駐泰翁公使貝克亦與古柏同機抵此、彼此會作若千次之坦白談話、兩氏皆以此等談話在將來或極有用爲言、古柏聲稱、吾人刻與美國密切合作、此種合作、極爲重要、余意不妨明言者、英國或美國皆不欲見戰爭波及太平洋、但如竟不能免、則吾人準備應付任何發展云、古柏末稱渠爲調查遠東局勢起見、殆必往游緬甸、澳洲與荷印、且有赴重慶之可能、但未必往游日本云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國德國與日本</h3>
<p>羅斯福氏在本月八日所準備發表的演說，不幸因羅母逝世而展緩到今天。在這三天當中，東西局勢都有新的事態發生：一方面繼格里埃號之後，又有鋼海員號貨輸的遭德擊沉與西薩號沉失事件的公布，另一方面，美日之間，在最近密切接觸之後，亦已有新的進展。則經過這一躭延，羅氏原有演詞勢必適應這些新的事態有所是正，而一般世人，亦復因此對於美方政策與反應得獲有更加深切瞭解的機會。</p>
<p>在此度歐戰初期，德方曾經審愼從事，避免觸犯美國，是以縱在上决大戰中在美國中立期間擊沉美方船隻之事層出不窮，此决則直到不久以前，年餘之間迄未觸犯美國海上權利，由此可見最近轟擊美船事件之層出小窮，德方並悍然以此自承，當絕非偶然事件可此。格里埃與鋼海員號事件，德國都以美船駛入封鎖下的　區爲唯一藉口，姑無論此目爲堅持海上自由的美國所決難承認、而且美政府也從未同意於把紅海和冰島附近列入所謂戰區，德方用意　無非要激怒美國，甘冒美國參戰的後果，關於這一點，本報日前已有所述。此種策略，假如施之一年以前，也許會更增强孤立派氣焰，使一部習於安逸的美人望而却步；然而以現在美國參戰醞釀的成熟，納粹聲勢的衰落、潛艇暴行之不足嚇退美國固極顯然。就想藉此把美國拖進戰爭漩渦亦復難遂所願。今年五六月間，德艇在大西洋活動會達到最高峯，使英關於戰具以至食物的航運遭受莫大困擾，但自從美方擴大巡邏制度與英方銳意改進海戰戰術以來，情勢大有起色，隔昨邱吉爾的戰局的報告於此已有詳盡說明。美國海軍主力並不在大西洋，不過以該方面英美海空軍　合作，對付僅能伺隙襲擊的德方機艇，即使還有若干困難、並不一定要美國正式參與戰爭纔能克服。因此美國雖距離戰爭邊緣更進一步，却並不見得會立即因德方挑釁而參戰，更何况中立法案迄今且猶存在，從現狀發展到實際作戰還有相當距離。另一方面，希特勒即使具有拖美國參戰的存心，他却不致鹵莽滅裂到自動對美宣戰，那不只不足助長聲勢，反會促成三國同盟的解體，早在數月之前，日當局已曾聲言，假如美德戰爭是因爲德國對美進攻而爆發，日本是可以不負赴援義務的。</p>
<p>倘使此際日本還具有尙堪一戰的實力，抑或確具納粹必勝的信心。則當此德方不斷對美挑釁之際，日本必亟謀利用此一時機，在履行同盟義務之中滿足自身的擴展願望。不過三國盟的的簽訂，歷時雖僅一年、一切都已勢異情遷，以是美德關係的惡化，乃並未引起日方何等興趣，格魯豐田間一週十二决的會晤，足徵日本之於美日關係，實遠較對盟的義務更加重視。假如說此際德方行動對日有所影響，那至多只是使美日談話更加積極，也許美國對日容或暫假辭色，却斷不會增進三國同盟的效果。目前國際形勢，任何稍有辨別力的人都可看出納粹頹勢日增，困難愈甚，即以攻蘇戰事而論，在戰略上舉棋不定。在戰果上無足稱述，轉瞬隆冬屆臨，希特勒未必不重蹈拿破崙的覆轍。伊拉克叙利亞伊朗問題相繼解決後，東西暴力陣營彼此匯合的唯一可能亦遭堵塞，事實若此，日本已被迫不能不爲自身利害打算。最近美日談判的進行，在日本是爲了窘境的打開，同時也是希望在英美優容之下另闢出路，無論其脫離軸心與吾，可斷言德國必難因美德交惡而收到三國盟的的實效。不過日方這種打算，只是爲一時利害着想，旣不是停止擴展，更談不到根本悔禍。</p>
<p>連日美日妥協即將成立之說極盛，就現勢論，誠屬不無可能，不過這至多只是暫時相安。絕不是主要癥結的打開，時至今日，無論在心理上以至政策上，在美日雙方之間還發現不出共同之點。據邱吉爾隔昨所表示；英美現行對日政策實與八項要點宣言等同出於最近羅邱會議的決定，八項要點既槪括着英美作戰的主要目標，則在同一會議中所決定的對日政策當不致在精神上與之刺謬。加以最近美當局所發出關於遠東問題的聲明與保證，更無異間接說明了美日談話的輪廓。至於中日間的問題，則中國當局已屢有聲明，無論美日間對此是吾觸及，都無需多事憂疑。凡此種種，今晚羅斯福的演說，相信必能予人以滿意的闡述</p>
<h3>中區前線紅軍　發動猛烈總反攻　德軍向西潰退二十公里　蘇獲空前大捷全國歡騰</h3>
<p>國際社十日莫斯科電　今日消息、中綫蘇軍大反攻、已擊潰德軍十萬、克復村莊五十餘、現正逼近斯摩倫斯克、同時紅軍高級司令部稱、列髯格勒奧迪薩守軍、迭决力拒敵軍之進攻、奧迪薩羅軍遭重大損失、高級司令部第一次正式宜佈、蘇軍巳改局部反攻爲總反攻、惟又承認列寗局勢危急、丁莫生柯元帥此次在中綫反攻得勝、蘇聯全國歡騰、蓋爲近來之最大勝利也、</p>
<p>塔斯社十日莫斯科電　「眞理報」著評、力言斯摩倫斯克附近紅軍大捷之重要、據謂雅爾尼亞城經紅軍克復後、德軍進攻莫斯科之企圖已完全失敗、蓋德佔雅爾尼亞之目的、即在利用該城集重兵進取蘇聯京城也、該報復謂紅軍擊潰德兵八師及克復村鎭五十餘處後、仍繼續推進、目前砲火綫已離雅爾尼亞二十公里、</p>
<p>合衆社十日倫敦電　權威方面稱、在戈美爾方面、蘇軍昨亦發動反攻、其規模雖或較之雅爾尼亞方面反攻爲小、但已有成功、但彼等相信尙未至足以阻止德軍自戈美爾向東南進攻之程度、列寗格勒戰綫之他處亦有劇戰、但並無顯然變、化</p>
<p>合衆社十日倫敦電　英國權威界昨稱、蘇聯已動員一千萬至一千五百萬員、並於三個月內予德國以較第一决歐戰任何一年中爲大之傷亡、列寗格勒之戰已加緊、聞雙方在惡戰中、柏林方面相信、德軍於十一月降雪以前、將佔領列寗格勒及奧迪薩、同時據英方消息、德國已增派生力軍五十萬、由歐洲之佔領區內及德國調往蘇聯、保衛由芬蘭以迄拉多加湖之一百哩前綫云、</p>

<h3>英首相在下院　檢討一般戰局　海戰有起色但危機未去　決盡力援蘇爭最後勝利</h3>
<p>路透社十日倫敦電　英相邱吉爾昨在下院檢討一般戰局、對於大西洋戰爭言之頗詳、謂「民衆已發生最近兩月事態大有起色之印象、余亦不能認爲不然、海戰起色見於兩方面、一方面爲英國與協的國船隻喪失之大减、與安抵吾人口岸的貨物噸數之大增、不獨可補足余於本年初所作一九四一年貨物愉入數量之估計、且亦超過之、另一方面爲德義船隻在過去三個月內喪失數之激增、此乃英國海岸指揮部與轟炸機隊新戰術之發展所致、而亦英潛艇之功績、敵船之爲我空軍與潛艇所殲滅者爲數甚衆、此點尙望下院予以注意、蓋七八兩月英國與協的國船隻之因敵方行爲而喪失者、尙不及德義船隻之爲我飛機與潛艇所擊沉者三分之一、此點尤可視爲重要者、以我方船隻行於海上可爲敵方攻擊之目標者、較諸敵船之可爲我方攻擊目標者多十倍或二十倍、而敵船僅作短程航行橫渡狹海、或在飛機保護下往來於有防禦工事之口岸、逈不似吾方經營遍及世界之貿易、無時不有二千艘以上之船隻行於海中、即行於危險區中者、亦無時不在叫百艘以上也、</p>
<p>協約國潛艇隊　造成優異成績</p>
<p>英國武裝在此戰局中受相失最車者無過於潛艇隊、而危險最甚者亦無過於此、計在一九四一年中、英潛艇共擊沉或重毀敵方軍艦十七艘、其中有敵潛艇若干、叉敵方供應船亦爲英潛艇所轟沉、平均計之、每月擊沉敵船十五艘、換言之即每兩日毀其一船是已、此項供應船中、包括許多滿載兵士之運輸船與油船、大都係行經地中海以接濟里比亞敵軍者、荷蘭與自由法國海軍之潛艇聯合行動、遂有此優異成績、</p>
<p>德敷音感水雷　現已不足爲患</p>
<p>水雷爲患今不常聞、但每夜輒有敵機三四十架用其種種方法、在船隻所可經過之處、拋落水雷、此種攻擊、常以音感水雷與磁性水雷爲之、但英方之科學與組織已戰勝之、故不常聞其爲患矣、英方有二寓人與船隻一千艘每晨工作不懈、用許多新奇器具以肅淸敵方夜間在港口與海峽所埋置之兇器、無論氣候如何惡劣、敵方如何攻擊此種工作未嘗稍停、吾人向無所聞者以此工作秘密進行絕不聲張也、開戰以還、撈船工作、已撈起沉船一百餘萬噸雖七八兩月海上損失業已大减、然若謂當前嚴重危險業已終止、則未免愚妄、蓋敵方現已使用較前更多之潛艇與長程飛機、而吾人料其今後將更甚也、</p>
<p>美英海軍合作　局勢爲之一變</p>
<p>美國在大西洋之行動、甚爲廣泛、不斷的巡邏通至西半球之路、德人對之甚形棘手、蓋恐與强大的美國海軍發生衝突也、此乃大有助於吾人者、余祝其可爲更大之助力、惟德國策略至此或將一變、希特勒無疑的亟願先解決英蘇、然後再與美國短兵相接、此乃其素行的個別擊破之策略、但希特勒亦亟欲阻止寳貴之軍械與供應品現依照美政府政策源源渡大西洋而來者之運抵英國、苟希特勒果欲阻止之、則危險區又將遍及大西洋矣、吾人此時莫作大西洋戰爭已獲勝利之空談、吾人對於所有之成功、爲吾人忍耐與奮勉之報酬者、固不妨認爲滿足、但戰事變化無窮、今尙未達止境也、</p>
<p>視察冰島防務　獲得良好印象</p>
<p>余與羅斯福總統晤談後欣然返國時、曾游冰島、備承冰島朝野之熱切招待、並獲檢閱英美軍隊之機會、此兩國軍隊因完全不同之理由、奉行其各別之職務、居然共同擔任此極重要島嶼可爲納粹橫跨大西洋從事侵略之起點地者之防務、英美海軍與空軍集於該島與紐芬蘭者亦復不少、定將在大西洋巡邏中與大隊重轟炸機不斷的每夜飛行中擔仟與日俱增之工作、蓋此種工作乃最後勝利中最有決定性的工作之一也、</p>
<p>英國先發制人　中東局勢穏定</p>
<p>吾人在東戰區之各事亦頗順利、吾人與伊拉克之關係、爲一種盟的所支配、此項盟的在戰時或其他緊要時、予吾人以保衛伊拉克與英國利益之大權、當德人肆其陰謀於伊拉克與親德派拉希德阿里攫取政權之時、吾人並非無備、吾人有保護伊拉克境內交通之櫛責、故立調準備應變之印軍一師開入巴斯拉、而拉希德阿里對我軍之入境猶佯作觀迎、蓋希望欲吾人承認其政權也、拉希德阿里屢請德方踐約、但德機從叙利亞入境者僅三四十架、欲駐於報達與摩蘇爾兩處、按德方之不能多派軍隊援助伊拉克、有一原因、緣德方傘兵與空中運輸之軍隊本可經叙利亞飛往伊拉克作戰者、巳泰半殲滅於克里特島之戰役也、德方特別訓成之空兵陣亡於此役者逾叫千人、而運兵飛機亦毀滅不少、故克里特之惡戰、雖使協的軍不得不撒退、然亦使德方喪其精銳而不能用於他處矣、迨伊拉克新政府成立、吾人乃能恢復友好合作之基礎、今雙方均忠實遵守盟的、雖伊拉克仍有須加注　之危險、但未引起重大悼慮、（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花　局勢之為寬為緊　卽紗市之為漲跌　去揭曉之期不遠靜觀為得</h3>
<p>上日大漲回挫後之紗市、昨則續趨下疲、此因空頭活躍、且謠諑紛紜、皆屬利空、允使多頭不安、然一般財力充實之戶、將多額非但不斬結逢低反而購進加碼、探其原因、實謂原棉來源艱難、且售價高昂、據云紡製二十支紗之原料價、每担須售三百五十元至三百八十元、一包棉紗需花三担半、再加開繳雜費二百五十元至三百元、如斯廠方成本在一千八九百元之間、所以膽力强壯者依然拖進、然一般投機的人們觀念閆相懸殊、謂國際局勢一緊市價即將大落、方始撈進、已可獲利到手、所以近來市塲上拋空者異常活躍、足使市面動盪不定、但除投機目的外、遠柬局勢之寬緊、允爲紗市投機命脈所擊、最近數日內確乎關係重要如其局面居然鬆下來、不但細絨的美棉可得、即粗絨未始不可得、種種情况、叉將大翻而特翻、若終不免拉破面皮、不但粗絨依然刦持不能來、即細絨或許砲火所阻檔、雖稈度不至快慢到如此地步、做投機的人們、還以暫時觀望爲得、至昨日紗市基礎似猶穩固、二十支雙馬市價爲一千七百五十二元、低價爲一千七百三十二元、午後開盤價爲一千七百三十五元跌至一千七百二十六元、牧盤聞取引所三盤已回好、隨之上升至一千七百三十九一兀收盤、塲外已做一千七百四十三元、取引所紗布晨跌午回、紗市若固人云亦云、漲亦漲而跌亦跌、亦是無甚意味、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因人心望小、首盤即下十元、爲一千十百四十元、但盈利人補進、漲至一千七百五十一元、旋後取引所開盤趨落、人心大鬆、即至一千七百三十七元、惟大戶某某逢低拖進、且原斜殊昂、買者尙有勇氣、再升至一千七百四十四元、不料十一時以後、塲中流言蠭起、空頭拋出、受其壓迫、又疲至一千七百三十二元、收盤價回好一步、至一千七百三十七元、查半日間成交統計八千六百三十五包、今日有紗五百八十件、運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左。</p>
<p>香港　一五五　同行　八、　五〇〇</p>
<p>統計八、六　五</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、　動激烈、雖然一度下瀉、當上午開出、雖洋花又高、但以謠傳美日談判和緩、致人心惶惶、浮多大起搖動、廠單首先下傾、而期紗初做尙稱穩後因取引所下跌加勁、故九月期自一六五〇元做開後、高至一六五二元、而　即低至一六四三元、十月期由六六四元、開出乃亦降　十　　、十一月期乃亦自一六七八元、跌至一六六九元、惟中途起伏、買戶多係進期貨出現貨之套頭故跌勢未見十分擴大、故午收僅各降十元左右、午後做開先以取引所繼續不振、廠單亦覺無力、期紗賣戶活潑、乃又續降、迨至收盤時、突起</p>
<h3>結匯或有通融辦法　洋花之盛况再起　啟椗在運之巴西棉尤所注目</h3>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、大衆購意熱烈、盛况遂有東山再起之象、良以外滙之結得、銀行已允或可有通融辦法、同時再因廠方觀於現棉羅致售價過昂、反不若直接訂購外棉得益良多、政適逢各外商棉業洋行能有大批巴西棉、將於近期內啟椗來滬之消息時、實爲大衆所不能輕易放棄之良機、於是連日各廠方之紛紛成定、已使各外商棉業洋行應接不暇、成交總額、半日間已達千包以上、預料因機會難逢、後來者愈見踴躍、棉市無疑更有順利進展也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、購意活躍、市况猛挺、先因同業買進而漲、續後再因華爾街買進、及空頭抵補熱烈推進、結果收盤價格、較之上日再漲念一至念六磅因不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、因有多頭了結、及投機者賣出而跌、收盤價格、各跌一羅比左右、預測今日開盤市况、看漲二·七五羅比、</p>

<p>我們結婚五載，現有二個半孩子，大的男孩四歲，小的女孩二歲，還有半個不久就將出世。在平時，住屋寬敞，帶幾個孩子還不至成問題，而現在則困難到了極點。要租房子就碰到「有小孩不租」的釘子，總算租了房子後才生小孩，房東不好意思叫你走。但是偌小的一間，小孩不知放在什麽地方好。放他在街上，則有走失與車輛的危險；放在家裏，不是信箋撕掉，就是把脚踏進痰盃，動一動就是闖禍。要他不動，自己亦不好意思。</p>
<p>孩子的模仿性太大了，大人的一言一動，他們都看在眼裏，等有機會的時候模仿出來。如我家同居打牌的很多，他們居然在拿到一塊圖章或類似竹牌的東西時，就會用小手一丢，嘴裏喊一聲「碰」！大孩子在街堂裏聽了幾句下流的駡人語，他回來就駡起他的爸來。可見得一個孩子的品性，受到環境的影響委實不比受到敎育的影響來得小。</p>
<p>孩子的興趣與大人完全兩樣，他們最感到興趣的是狗貓等小動物與會動的柬西。這些東西大人未必最感興趣，所以大人把自己喜歡的東西，硬要孩子亦喜歡，這是最笨拙的舉動。孩子對一切事物，亦有他特殊的理解。有一次，大孩子看到他爸爸的領帶，他說：「這是爸爸的尾巴」，因爲他看貓狗都有尾巴，爸爸這一條東西拖着，大概也是尾巴了。還有一次小孩子剛睡醒，一眼張開時，大孩子說：「妹妹」隻眼睛睡醒了」這種理解有時錯誤，有時反比大人理解的更正確一些。當他們在無法理解而發問時，這是敎育的最好機會。</p>
<p>制止小孩過失最普通的辦法是打，但是這辦法大都祇能見效一時。因爲孩子挨打　哭泣一塲之後，往往不明白打的原因，而反在避免打的方法上着想，有時會把打當作應盡的義務。有一次有幾個孩干在手上塗一種野草的液汁，他們說塗了這東西可以打手心不痛，可見得打的效果很細微。</p>
<p>我覺得糾正小孩過失的最好方法是鼓勵，以他最熟識的小伴作榜樣，譬如在孩子偷一樣東西吃後，你對他說某孩不偷吃，某孩多吃了生病等事實，三翻四覆向他講，他自會感到不應該，以後改正。人類有向善向上的本性，積極的因勢利導，反比消極的事後痛打來得有效。有許多打慣了的孩子會養成一種奴性。</p>
<p>我覺得做父母最担心的，是學校與社會隔得太速，孩子在學校裹學到的做人態度，與他在校門外，甚至下課後所見到的，不但兩樣，而且恰恰相反。這對於他們弱小心靈上的影響多麼重大，他們亦會變得很乖巧，很虛僞，持着兩★人格，下一代的國民將如何呢？</p>

<h3>簡單的希望</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福的太夫人逝世了。這位民主國的台柱的母親，其平日的嘉言懿行，當然値得我們注意。</p>
<p>據羅斯福的母親生前自述，她從來沒有想到她的兒子會做美國總統，也不敢抱這種非分的夢想。</p>
<p>可是她對於她的唯一的孩子，並不是完全沒有抱着甚麼希望的。她跟其他的母親一樣，也替自己的孩子懷着一個重要的希望。可是她的希望很簡單。她祇希望羅斯福長大的時候，能和他的父親一樣，公正率直，溫和誠懇，做一個高尙有用的美國人。</p>
<p>羅斯福的母親依着這個目標去敎育他的兒子，終於達到了她的目的了。這目標雖然簡單，然而却是合理的，根本的。</p>
<p>父母對於子女所抱的理想與希望，是應該從根本的方面着想的，也唯有從根本着想，才是合理的。職業以及社會地位，跟一個人的機會和能力，有密切的關係，往往不是父母的空想所能達到的。過高的期望，所得到的不過是夢的幻減與心的破碎而已。</p>
<p>羅斯福的母親對於她的兒子的希望，是可以做天下做父母的人的借鏡的。</p>

<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>假使孟老掌檯還有一分人心的話，他應該就自動的給秋海棠幫忙了。每天無論什麼時候，只耍他從後進的屋裏走到外面的舖子裏來，把眼睛看向對面去，就可以看見秋海棠獨自掇着一條板櫈，垂頭喪氣的坐在大門口。逢到街上有一個人走過，他總是立刻昂起頭來，睜大着一雙眸子，急急向來人打量。及至看明白不是小狗子，或是那個他所想望的郵差時，他才嘆一口氣，又把腦袋垂下去了。像這樣從早到晚的盼望着，簡直連一些東西也不見他吃下去</p>
<p>「今兒又是沒有，待明天再瞧吧」！郵差先生顯着一種無可奈何的神氣說。半個月來，他已經也習慣了，在經過吳家的門首時，不等秋海棠問他，便往往自動的這樣說，結果當然是又給秋海棠加上了一種愁悶。</p>
<p>愁悶愈壓愈重，不知不覺就把人的精神壓得一天不如一天了。</p>
<p>僅饉隔了二十天不到的工夫，秋海棠在外表上，已比先前顯得老了許多；他這樣整天愁眉不展的神態，雖然打不動那個做了三四十年賣買的孟老掌櫃的心，但看在他兒媳的眼裏，却已覺得很不安了。</p>
<p>「你放寬心吧！吳家伯伯，梅寶迎早一定可以回來的」。有一個晚上，她終於悄悄地掩到了吳家來，漲幻着臉，向秋海棠說：一現在你憂急也沒有用，她準是好好地在什麽地方留着，不過……不過……」，（二〇八）</p>

<p>圓圓說的這幾句話太激烈了，伊也不顧忌諱，奪忤田宏遇的意，却不肯不說，這也因爲伊心中別有一種痴望。以前伊在姑蘇臺畔時，吳三桂慕伊的艷名，曾遺一使者從關外遠道前來，齊金往聘。但是當時伊的一片芳心已屬于惜王詞人，所以婉言辭却。等到吳三桂後來再派心腹前來時，圓圓已被田宏遇强載而去了。現在圓圓聽得吳三桂在京，不禁心有所感，悔當初不早嫁了三桂，那麼侍奉風流名將的巾櫛，豈不勝於這暮氣沉沉，龍鍾衰朽的田老頭兒嗎？伊被田宏遇緊問有無辦法，遂想出這一條計策，無非借此要想和吳三桂一覲容顏罷了。田宏遇起初聽了圓圓這樣說，心中不免有些惱怒，以爲圓圓把他和石崇相較，很覺不祥。但再一轉念自己欲求安寗，非要結交將軍不可，那麼吳三桂自是一時之俊，理當和他相交，投其所好了。圓圓之言未嘗不是，不過太直率一些罷了。遂對圓圓說道：「好，你說得眞爽快？老夫聽你的辦法就是了。」圓圓方纔回轉身來說道：「大人以爲我的話說得對嗎？小女子胡說八道，還要請大人裁酌。」田宏遇一摸髭髯，說道：「老夫旣要保全身家性命，有個泰山長城之靠，也祇有這樣做了。」於是次日田宏遇就跑到吳三桂那裏去拜訪。原來吳三桂的老家本在京中，父親吳　現任督理御營之職。吳三桂來京時即住在家裏，常有宴會，門庭問熱鬧異常。這天三桂剛燕處小憇，忽聞田國丈駕臨。自思我和此人素不親近，突然下訪，可有何事。立即請入相見。（一六五）</p>

<h3>US-Received Danish Cargo Ship Sunk off Iceland; Washington State Department Officially Announces Loss of 24 Crew Members of the "West Sesia"</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 10th (Urgent Telegram) - The State Department learned yesterday afternoon that the Panamanian ship "West Sesia," under American management, was torpedoed off Iceland on August 17th, with 24 crew members lost, including one American. The three survivors were rescued on September 8th. Unofficial sources here say that the American cargo ship "Steel Mariner," recently sunk in the Red Sea, had its lights on and American torches displayed when it was bombed. The only American crew member of the "West Sesia" was a radio operator named Mohammed, aged 44. The ship's crew included one Irishman, seven Danes, two Norwegians, two Swedes, two Icelanders, five Portuguese, one Belgian, five Britons, one Spaniard, and the Danish shipowner, Nielsen. The State Department announced that the "West Sesia" was carrying food, grain, timber, and other ordinary goods, with no munitions or war ordnance. The cargo belonged to the Icelandic government. The State Department's announcement regarding the sinking of the "West Sesia" stated that a naval department notified the State Department on the morning of September 6th that the naval department had rescued three surviving crew members of the "West Sesia" about 300 miles southwest of Iceland. The other 21 crew members are presumed lost. The State Department learned that the survivors said the ship was torpedoed on August 17th. One of the crew members was an American, whose name is unknown and who was not among the survivors. The State Department has also not received notification of the names of the three rescued. The "West Sesia" was formerly a Danish ship, obtained by the Danish government under the recent law permitting the reception of idle foreign cargo ships in American territorial waters. The ship was registered in Panama and was carrying supplies from the Icelandic government to Iceland, including food, grain, materials, and other ordinary goods, but no munitions. A State Department spokesman said that the ship was received by the U.S. Maritime Commission and managed by a company in New York during the voyage.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 10th - Responsible officials declared that the American war threat has shifted from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and said that Germany may be adopting unrestricted warfare against maritime navigation. They cited the sinking of the American ships Greer, West Sesia, and Steel Mariner as evidence.</p>
<p>International News Service, Red Sea Port, 10th - All 36 officers and soldiers of the American cargo ship "Steel Mariner" safely landed here yesterday. It is said that when the bomber sank the ship, the ship and the American flag were clearly visible. The rescued could not identify the aircraft, but all identified it as "German."</p>
<p>Washington Political Circles Stirred Up; Believe Germany Will Drag America Into War</p>
<p>Universal News Service, Washington, 10th - The recent attacks on American ships have caused a stir in political circles here, and it is believed that Churchill's warning that Nazi actions against American Atlantic patrol routes may be consistent, and should be taken very seriously. It was previously generally believed here that Hitler would avoid attacks on American ships, fearing American anger. However, some now believe that Hitler, in his recklessness, may order attacks, repeating the mistakes of the German Emperor in 1917. Hitler is aware that this action may drag the United States into the war.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 10th - The news of the sinking of the American-managed, Panama-registered cargo ship "West Sesia" coincides with Churchill's warning that Hitler may expand the war to the Americas. Oklahoma Democratic Senator Thomas said, "As a result of the Greer incident, the United States has committed to providing greater naval assistance to England." Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference that although the "West Sesia" flew the Panamanian flag, it was managed by an American company. Hull said, "We can have no doubt who instigated the attack on the 'West Sesia'," but he would only discuss it after receiving more reports. The announcement of the sinking of the "West Sesia" followed the announcement of the bombing of the "Steel Mariner" at the mouth of the Suez Canal, 48 hours after the Greer incident. The development of the situation strengthens the belief that the American Navy will meet force with force in American territorial waters, challenging any German attempt to cut off British supply routes.</p>
<p>American Policy Is Changing; Determined to Ensure Maritime Routes</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th - There is now reason to believe that the sinking of the American ships "Steel Mariner" and "West Sesia" by the Germans, and the attack on the American ship Greer by the Germans, are currently prompting a change in American policy. It is believed here that the sinking of the "West Sesia" is more important than the other two incidents. The fact that the "West Sesia" flew the Panamanian flag may not change the American reaction, as the ship is American-owned and is being re-registered from Panama to the United States. There is much speculation as to why the news of the sinking of the "West Sesia" was not announced for so long. According to Reuters, the U.S. Marine Corps radio station in Iceland reported last Thursday that the "West Sesia" was overdue and feared it had been torpedoed. Neither the British nor American radio stations seemed to have received this message, so the State Department's announcement of the ship's sinking yesterday came as a shock. It is believed that the reason this news was not announced earlier was to await detailed reports from the rescued crew members. Reuters has learned from reliable sources that President Roosevelt originally intended to announce the sinking on a broadcast on Sunday night, but due to the death of his mother, it was postponed to a broadcast on Thursday. At that time, the President is expected to respond to Churchill's call for continued naval assistance. In fact, Churchill had already received a response before making this call, as the President's broadcast speech was already drafted and scheduled to be delivered on Sunday. It is said that the President will explain in his broadcast that due to the Nazi attacks on American ships, the Atlantic patrol policy will be changed. Well-informed sources believe that President Roosevelt will announce an inviolable maritime route between the United States and Iceland, and that any hostile warships found on this route will be destroyed. In other words, any German submarine, surface vessel, or aircraft entering this area will risk destruction by the U.S. Navy, and even if they only enter the area, it will be regarded as a hostile act and destroyed. The width of this maritime route is not yet known, but it can be guessed that it will be wide enough to ensure the absolute safety of supplies to Britain between the United States and Iceland.</p>
<p>Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Advocates Repealing the Neutrality Act</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th - According to reliable rumors from well-informed sources, President Roosevelt will, in his speech tomorrow, demand that Germany pay close attention to the American ship and life losses caused by Nazi actions. It is said that the United States has lost a total of five ships for the aforementioned reasons, and the number of American casualties should be at least 65. It is said that the American President is still engaged in drafting this speech. Although there is no news yet as to whether the President will announce any action to realize the respect of American maritime rights, it is believed that the President will clearly state that the United States insists on maritime liberalism, without any doubt. Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declared that the Neutrality Act, which binds our assistance to Britain, should be repealed.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of State Convenes Meeting of Far East Experts to Prepare for Future Policy Towards Japan</h3>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 10th - Secretary of State Hull convened an important meeting of his Far East affairs advisors yesterday, while the United States awaits Japan's announcement of its "major decision," which it has agreed to announce tomorrow. This decision will affect Japan's military policy. It is believed that the purpose of the meeting convened by Hull is to prepare countermeasures in case Konoe's declaration further strains the Pacific relations between Japan and the United States, and how to respond. However, some also believe that Konoe may announce that Japanese policy has changed, with U.S.-Japan harmony as the principle, or even abandoning the Axis. At the same time as Hull convened the meeting, the U.S. Tariff Commission published a detailed survey of Japanese goods imported into the United States, proving that if this trade were completely stopped, it would have no impact on the American defense program or the nation's future.</p>
<h3>Toyota Privy Council Explains US-Japan Negotiations</h3>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 10th - Reliable sources claim that Foreign Minister Toyota revealed at the Privy Council today, when explaining the European situation, that the current friendly negotiations between Japan and the United States are proceeding. Observers have noticed that Japanese and American officials and business circles are gradually becoming optimistic about the possibility of success in friendly relations between Japan and the United States. Japanese newspapers also seem to be making every effort to promote this, so they have all stopped publishing anti-American commentary.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 10th - Reports were received from international sources yesterday that some major figures believe that Germany will not be able to win this war, so Japan is attempting to reduce its relationship with the Axis powers and, to the extent possible, quickly strengthen its relations with Britain and the United States in order to "save face." However, this report did not indicate that Japan would openly or formally break with the Axis powers. According to the report, this move would be extremely dangerous and could cause serious internal repercussions. A Tokyo spokesman's criticism said that if the United States could resume oil shipments to Japan, Japan would not oppose the United States shipping oil to the Soviet Union. This move illustrates an example of Japan adjusting its national relations with the United States. Informed circles speculate that Prime Minister Konoe's recent declaration seems to be telling the Japanese people that the United States and Japan have begun negotiations to improve relations between the two countries. It is believed that this kind of negotiation is of a "probing nature," seeking ways for Japan to obtain a "glorious" retreat from its current predicament. It is said that Japan may later abandon the Axis, allowing the Soviet Union's resistance to remain tenacious.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 10th - The board of directors of the American School in Japan met today to discuss liquidating the school. As a result, it was decided to continue occupying the current school building, but the semester will be temporarily postponed. This move reflects the growing hope for friendly relations between Japan and the United States.</p>
<h3>US Railway Workers Prepare to Strike; Nearly One Million Participants</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th - The leaders of 19 railway labor unions were ordered last Friday to launch a strike. Among them, the non-mechanical workers' union has about 900,000 members and has set Thursday as the strike date. The mechanical workers' union, with five branches totaling 350,000 members, has set September 15th as the strike date. They are demanding wage increases. According to the Railway Labor Act, whenever the above situation occurs, President Roosevelt must appoint an investigation committee to report within one month, so the strike date set by the union may not be the real date of the work stoppage, because a legal strike cannot be launched within 30 days after the investigation committee reports. President Roosevelt is expected to return to Washington today and will select this committee.</p>
<h3>Allied Forces Complete Mission; Withdraw from Spitsbergen Island; Not a Single Resident Left on the Island; All Coal Mines Destroyed</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th - Officials announced that the British Allied forces who had been dispatched to the Spitsbergen Islands have safely returned to England, and that the islands have been left with nothing that can be used by the enemy. The Allied forces, during their brief stay in the Spitsbergen Islands, destroyed the coal mines, including 150,000 tons of stored coal, and destroyed a radio station that had been providing valuable information to the Germans. All the residents of the island have been evacuated, without leaving a single person behind. When Canadian troops landed on the island in small boats, they were greeted by a reception committee who showered them with candy and cigarettes. The residents of the island then assisted the Canadian troops in carrying out the destruction work.</p>
<p>United Press International, Berlin, 10th - German authorities commented yesterday on the British landing in Spitsbergen, saying, "We wish them a stable winter there." There was no other movement or legal strike. President Roosevelt is expected to return to Washington today and will select this committee.</p>
<h3>Duff Cooper Arrives in Singapore; Will Visit Burma, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 10th - Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's Special Representative for the Far East, arrived here yesterday. It is said that although the heat from Japan has not subsided, its momentum seems to have slowed down, which is quite gratifying. Reuters has learned that U.S. Minister to Thailand, Baker, also arrived here on the same plane as Cooper, and the two have had several frank conversations, both of whom said that these conversations may be very useful in the future. Cooper stated that we are currently working closely with the United States, and this cooperation is extremely important. I think it is fair to say that neither Britain nor the United States wants to see the war spread to the Pacific, but if it cannot be avoided, we are prepared to deal with any developments. Cooper concluded that he would visit Burma, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies to investigate the situation in the Far East, and may also visit Chongqing, but not necessarily Japan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States, Germany, and Japan</h3>
<p>The speech that Roosevelt was preparing to deliver on the 8th of this month was unfortunately postponed to today due to the death of his mother. In these three days, new developments have occurred in both the Eastern and Western situations: on the one hand, following the Greer incident, the sinking of the "Steel Mariner" cargo ship and the announcement of the loss of the "West Sesia" have occurred; on the other hand, between the United States and Japan, there have been new developments after recent close contacts. With this delay, Roosevelt's original speech will inevitably be revised to adapt to these new situations, and the general public will also have the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of U.S. policy and reaction.</p>
<p>In the early stages of this European war, Germany acted cautiously to avoid offending the United States, so even though there were countless instances of sinking American ships during the U.S. neutrality in the previous Great War, Germany did not violate American maritime rights until recently, for over a year. This shows that the recent series of attacks on American ships, which Germany has brazenly admitted, are by no means accidental. In the Greer and Steel Mariner incidents, Germany used the excuse that the American ships had entered the blockade zone as the only reason, regardless of whether this was a decision that the United States, which insists on maritime freedom, could hardly recognize, and the U.S. government has never agreed to include the Red Sea and the vicinity of Iceland in the so-called war zone. Germany's intention is nothing more than to anger the United States, risking the consequences of American participation in the war. As this newspaper mentioned some days ago, if this strategy had been implemented a year earlier, it might have further strengthened the isolationist sentiments, causing some Americans who are accustomed to comfort to retreat in fear; however, with the maturity of American participation in the war and the decline of the Nazi momentum, it is extremely obvious that the submarine atrocities are not enough to deter the United States. It is also difficult to achieve the desire to drag the United States into the war. In May and June of this year, German submarines were most active in the Atlantic, causing great difficulties for British shipping of war materials and food, but since the United States expanded its patrol system and Britain has been keen to improve its naval tactics, the situation has improved greatly. Churchill's report on the war situation yesterday provided detailed explanations on this point. The main force of the U.S. Navy is not in the Atlantic, but with the cooperation of the British and American naval and air forces in that area, dealing with the German aircraft that can only attack opportunistically, even if there are still some difficulties, does not necessarily require the United States to formally participate in the war to overcome. Therefore, although the United States is one step closer to the edge of the war, it does not seem to be immediately drawn into the war by German provocations, not to mention that the Neutrality Act still exists, and there is still a considerable distance from the current situation to actual combat. On the other hand, even if Hitler has the intention of dragging the United States into the war, he will not be reckless enough to automatically declare war on the United States. That would not only fail to boost his momentum but would also promote the disintegration of the Tripartite Pact. As early as a few months ago, the Japanese authorities had stated that if the U.S.-German war broke out because of German aggression against the United States, Japan could not be obligated to go to the rescue.</p>
<p>If Japan still had the strength to fight, or if it had the confidence that the Nazis would win, then at a time when Germany was constantly provoking the United States, Japan would inevitably seek to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfill its expansionist desires while fulfilling its alliance obligations. However, although the signing of the Tripartite Pact has only been a year, everything has changed. The deterioration of U.S.-German relations has not aroused any interest from Japan. The twelve meetings between Grew and Toyota in a week are sufficient evidence that Japan attaches far greater importance to U.S.-Japan relations than to its alliance obligations. If German actions have any impact on Japan at this time, it is only to make U.S.-Japan talks more active. Perhaps the United States will temporarily treat Japan kindly, but it will never enhance the effect of the Tripartite Pact. In the current international situation, anyone with a little discernment can see that the Nazi decline is increasing day by day, and the difficulties are becoming more and more severe. Even in the war against the Soviet Union, the strategic indecision and the insignificant war results are readily apparent. With the imminent arrival of the severe winter, Hitler may not repeat Napoleon's mistakes. After the successive solutions to the problems of Iraq, Syria, and Iran, the only possibility of the East-West violence camps merging together has also been blocked. Given these facts, Japan has been forced to consider its own interests. The recent negotiations between the United States and Japan are intended to open up a way out of the predicament for Japan, and at the same time, they hope to open up a new path under the indulgence of Britain and the United States. Regardless of whether it leaves the Axis or not, it can be asserted that Germany will not be able to achieve the practical results of the Tripartite Pact due to the deterioration of U.S.-German relations. However, this plan of Japan is only for temporary gain. It is not a cessation of expansion, and even less a fundamental repentance.</p>
<p>In recent days, there has been a great deal of talk that a U.S.-Japan compromise is about to be reached. In terms of the current situation, it is indeed not impossible. However, at most, this is only a temporary peace and by no means a resolution of the major issues. As of today, there are no common points between the United States and Japan, either psychologically or politically. According to what Churchill indicated yesterday, the current British and American policies toward Japan are the same as the Eight-Point Declaration, both stemming from the decisions of the recent Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Since the Eight-Point Declaration outlines the main goals of the British and American war efforts, the policies toward Japan decided at the same meeting should not be inconsistent with it in spirit. In addition, the recent statements and assurances issued by the U.S. authorities regarding the Far East problem indirectly illustrate the outline of the U.S.-Japan talks. As for the problems between China and Japan, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly stated that regardless of whether the United States and Japan touch upon this, there is no need to worry about it. All of this, Roosevelt's speech tonight, I believe, will be able to provide a satisfactory elaboration.</p>
<h3>Red Army on the Central Front Launches a Fierce General Counter-Offensive; German Army Collapses Westward for Twenty Kilometers; Soviets Achieve Unprecedented Victory, Nation Rejoices</h3>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 10th - Today's news: the Soviet Army on the central front launched a major counter-offensive, defeating 100,000 German troops and recapturing more than 50 villages, and is now approaching Smolensk. At the same time, the Red Army High Command stated that the defending forces of Leningrad and Odessa have repeatedly resisted the enemy's offensive. The Romanian army in Odessa suffered heavy losses. The High Command officially announced for the first time that the Soviet Army has changed from a partial counter-offensive to a general counter-offensive, but also acknowledged that the situation in Leningrad is critical. Marshal Timoshenko's victory in this counter-offensive on the central front has caused the Soviet Union to rejoice throughout the country, as it is the greatest victory in recent times.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 10th - The "Pravda" newspaper, in a commentary, emphasized the importance of the Red Army's great victory near Smolensk, saying that after the Red Army recaptured the city of Yartsevo, the German attempt to attack Moscow has completely failed, because the purpose of the German occupation of Yartsevo was to use the city to concentrate heavy troops to capture the Soviet capital. The newspaper further stated that after the Red Army defeated eight German divisions and recaptured more than 50 villages and towns, it continued to advance, and the current artillery line is 20 kilometers away from Yartsevo.</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 10th - Authoritative sources stated that the Soviet Army also launched a counter-offensive in the Gomel area yesterday. Although its scale may be smaller than the counter-offensive in the Yartsevo area, it has been successful. But they believe that it is not yet sufficient to prevent the German army from advancing southeast from Gomel. There were also fierce battles elsewhere on the Leningrad front, but there were no obvious changes.</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 10th - British authorities stated yesterday that the Soviet Union has mobilized 10 million to 15 million soldiers and has inflicted greater casualties on Germany in three months than in any year of the First European War. The battle of Leningrad has intensified. It is heard that in the fierce fighting, Berlin believes that the German army will occupy Leningrad and Odessa before the snowfall in November. At the same time, according to British sources, Germany has sent 500,000 additional troops from the occupied areas in Europe and Germany to the Soviet Union to defend the 100-mile front from Finland to Lake Ladoga.</p>
<p>Germany Claims to Have Occupied Schlüsselburg; Intensifies Encirclement of Leningrad</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 10th - Today, a special communiqué was issued here on the progress of the German-Soviet war, stating that the German army has occupied Schlüsselburg to the east of Leningrad and has completely encircled Leningrad. The communiqué also stated that because the German and Finnish armies have occupied the source of electricity supply, the electricity outside Leningrad has been completely cut off from the city. The German radio station praised this victory today, saying that Leningrad is the most important industrial city in the Soviet Union after Moscow, and 50% of the country's shipbuilding industry is concentrated there. It also said that the occupation of Schlüsselburg has enabled the Germans to completely control all ships on the Neva River and the White Sea Canal. The German High Command stated today that Leningrad is now under heavy artillery fire, and the city's 3 million residents are currently under heavy bombing by the German air force.</p>
<p>Red Army Crosses River and Inflicts Heavy Losses on Italian Army; Battles in Odessa Region Stall</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 10th - The United Press International radio station here obtained a report acknowledging that Soviet troops have crossed the Dnieper River again, an area where the Italian army is stationed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th - Recent German war reports stated that the Ukrainian front, where the Italian army is stationed, has stalled due to the strength of the Odessa defenses.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 10th - There are still fierce battles near Odessa, the southern city. The Romanian army suffered extremely heavy losses. In the past ten days, the Romanian army has lost 20,000 officers and soldiers. The First Regiment of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet Marines fought extremely bravely, constantly attacking the enemy. In the past three days, the regiment annihilated two Romanian regiments and obtained a large number of spoils of war.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister in the House of Commons Reviewing the General War Situation: Naval Battles Improving, but the Crisis Remains; Determined to Fully Support the Soviet Union and Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: British Prime Minister Churchill yesterday reviewed the general war situation in the House of Commons, speaking in detail about the Atlantic war. He said, "The public has the impression that the situation in the last two months has greatly improved, and I cannot disagree. The improvement in naval battles is evident in two aspects. On the one hand, there has been a significant reduction in the loss of British and Allied ships and a substantial increase in the tonnage of goods safely arriving at our ports, which not only makes up for my estimate at the beginning of this year for the quantity of goods imported in 1941 but also exceeds it. On the other hand, there has been a sharp increase in the number of German and Italian ships lost in the past three months. This is due to the development of new tactics by the British Coastal Command and bomber squadrons, as well as the achievements of British submarines. The number of enemy ships destroyed by our air force and submarines is very large, which I hope the House will pay attention to. In July and August, the losses of British and Allied ships due to enemy actions were less than one-third of the German and Italian ships sunk by our aircraft and submarines. This is particularly important because our ships at sea are ten or twenty times more likely to be targeted by the enemy than enemy ships are to be targeted by us. Enemy ships only make short voyages across narrow seas or travel between fortified ports under aircraft protection, unlike our worldwide trade, with more than two thousand ships constantly at sea, and even in dangerous areas, there are always hundreds or more."</p>
<p>Allied Submarine Force Achieves Excellent Results</p>
<p>The British armed force that has suffered the most losses and faced the greatest dangers in this war is undoubtedly the submarine force. It is estimated that in 1941, British submarines sank or severely damaged seventeen enemy warships, including several enemy submarines. Enemy supply ships were also sunk by British submarines. On average, fifteen enemy ships were sunk each month, which means one ship was destroyed every two days. These supply ships included many troop transports and oil tankers, mostly traveling through the Mediterranean to supply enemy forces in Libya. The combined actions of the Dutch and Free French naval submarines have led to these excellent results.</p>
<p>German Acoustic Mines No Longer a Major Threat</p>
<p>Mines are not often heard of as a problem now, but every night, thirty or forty enemy aircraft use various methods to drop mines in areas where ships may pass. These attacks often involve acoustic and magnetic mines, but British science and organization have overcome them, so they are not often heard of as a problem. The British have two hundred people and one thousand ships working tirelessly every morning, using many novel devices to clear the deadly weapons the enemy has planted at night in ports and straits. Regardless of the weather or enemy attacks, this work has never stopped. We have never heard of it because this work is carried out in secret and is never publicized. Since the beginning of the war, salvage work has recovered more than one million tons of sunken ships. Although maritime losses in July and August have been greatly reduced, it would be foolish to say that the current serious dangers have ended. The enemy is now using more submarines and long-range aircraft than before, and we expect they will do even more in the future.</p>
<p>US-British Naval Cooperation Transforms the Situation</p>
<p>The United States' actions in the Atlantic are extensive, continuously patrolling the routes to the Western Hemisphere, which is very troublesome for the Germans, who fear a conflict with the powerful American navy. This greatly helps us, and I hope it can be of even greater assistance. However, German strategy may now change. Hitler undoubtedly wants to resolve the British and Soviet issues first and then engage the United States in direct combat. This is his usual strategy of defeating opponents individually. But Hitler also desperately wants to prevent valuable armaments and supplies, which are now flowing across the Atlantic in accordance with US government policy, from reaching Britain. If Hitler really wants to prevent this, then the dangerous zone will spread throughout the Atlantic. We should not engage in empty talk about the Atlantic war already being won. We can be satisfied with all the successes that are the reward for our patience and hard work, but the war is constantly changing and has not yet reached its end.</p>
<p>Inspection of Icelandic Defenses Yields a Good Impression</p>
<p>When I happily returned home after meeting with President Roosevelt, I visited Iceland and received a warm welcome from all levels of Icelandic society and had the opportunity to review the British and American troops. These two countries' troops, for entirely different reasons, are carrying out their respective duties, jointly defending this extremely important island, which could be used by the Nazis as a starting point for aggression across the Atlantic. There are also many British and American naval and air forces stationed on the island and in Newfoundland, which will increasingly play a role in the Atlantic patrols and the continuous nightly flights of large heavy bombers. This kind of work is one of the most decisive factors in the final victory.</p>
<p>British Preemptive Action Stabilizes the Middle East Situation</p>
<p>Our affairs in the Eastern theater are also progressing smoothly. Our relationship with Iraq is governed by a treaty of alliance, which grants us broad powers to protect Iraq and British interests in wartime or other critical times. When the Germans were plotting in Iraq and the pro-German Rashid Ali seized power, we were not unprepared. We had a responsibility to protect transportation within Iraq, so we immediately dispatched a ready-to-respond Indian division to Basra, while Rashid Ali pretended to welcome our troops, hoping we would recognize his regime. Rashid Ali repeatedly asked the Germans to fulfill their promises, but only thirty or forty German aircraft arrived from Syria, intending to station themselves in Baghdad and Mosul. One reason why the Germans could not send more troops to assist Iraq was that the German paratroopers and airborne troops who could have flown to Iraq via Syria to fight had been mostly annihilated in the Battle of Crete. More than ten thousand specially trained German airborne troops were killed in this battle, and many transport aircraft were destroyed. Therefore, although the fierce battle of Crete forced the Allied forces to withdraw, it also caused the Germans to lose their elite forces and prevented them from being used elsewhere. When the new Iraqi government was established, we were able to restore the basis for friendly cooperation. Now both sides are faithfully adhering to the alliance, although there are still dangers in Iraq that require attention, but they have not caused major concerns. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Iran Fulfills Armistice Conditions, Eradicates Nazi Influence</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: Foreign Secretary Eden today clearly announced in the House of Commons that Britain will not allow any delay in the fulfillment of the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian agreement. In response to questions, the Foreign Secretary said that the Iranian government has accepted the Anglo-Soviet conditions, which stipulate that the German ambassador and his staff must leave Tehran immediately, and the German embassy will be closed, as will the Italian and Hungarian embassies. The Iranian government has announced that it has asked the aforementioned four countries' embassies to comply and has ordered the cessation of coded or wireless communications facilities for the Axis embassies. The Iranian government is now taking steps to transfer German nationals to the British and Soviet governments.</p>

<h3>Battles in Northern Hunan Province Gradually Expanding; Japanese Troops Advance Southeast from Yuezhou; Chinese Elite Troops Launch Attacks on Japanese Rear</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to front-line war reports, the battles in northern Hunan province are gradually expanding due to the successive arrival of Japanese reinforcements. Approximately 15,000 Japanese troops are participating in the fighting. About 9,000 Japanese troops are advancing southeast from Yuezhou, of which 3,000 have reached Mengcheng and Fuzhong (both transliterated). Another column of more than 5,000 troops has departed from Taolin and Xidian (transliterated), heading south towards Qibuling and Zhaoxialing (both transliterated). One contingent of about 2,000 troops is currently attacking Zhanjiaqiao and Lingdian (transliterated). Chinese troops are currently resisting the Japanese advance in both the southeast directions and have dispatched elite troops to attack the Japanese rear. According to Chinese sources in Changde, a Japanese unit is currently advancing north from Liqiaohe (transliterated). (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Wartime Macau Increasingly Prosperous</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Wartime Macau is becoming increasingly prosperous, ushering in a new era in Macau's history, exceeding the dreams of the people of Macau. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, wealthy refugees moved to Macau from various parts of South China. Because Portugal maintained neutrality in the European war, Macau benefited greatly in commercial terms. Macau has no military significance, and there are no defenses, so the idle and wealthy classes of Hong Kong have moved to Macau and are spending lavishly. Macau has mountains of goods waiting to be shipped to all parts of the world. Before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Axis goods transshipped from Siberia and Shanghai used Macau as a distribution center. Macau has steamships connecting to Saigon, Hanoi, and Guangzhou Bay, and Japanese ships also frequently arrive in Macau. There are also civilian ships connecting to the mainland. In the past, Macau's transportation with the outside world relied entirely on Hong Kong, but now transportation is developed, so business is also booming. Some people are planning to develop Macau into a deep-water port to accommodate the anchorage of ocean-going mail ships. South of Macau are two islands, one is Taipa Island (transliterated) and the other is Coloane Island (transliterated). If the shallow sandy beaches on these two islands are filled in, and then the northern waterway of the two islands is filled in, then the Greater Macau plan can be achieved. Although the cost of this project is very large, the Portuguese authorities have abundant tax revenues, so it is not difficult to raise funds for this construction. If Macau can become a first-class port in the Far East, then the three types of taxes on opium, gambling, and prostitution, which have always been regarded as major sources of revenue, may also be eliminated. The Portuguese government also plans to build a powerful shortwave radio station in Macau to connect with various parts of the Far East and relay messages to various parts of the United States.

<h3>Heavy Rain Causes Disaster in Chongqing; Landslides in Several Parts of the City; Roads Damaged and Houses Collapsed; Bridges Destroyed and Transportation Interrupted</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since Sunday night, heavy rain has been pouring down, almost unprecedented, causing major landslides in several parts of Chongqing, damaging roads, collapsing houses, causing casualties, and starting at least one fire. On Sunday night, Jiang Jieshi's political advisor, Dr. Wilhelm Haas, and Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, narrowly escaped disaster. A huge stone above their residences slid down from the rock and collapsed a house, killing one person and injuring several. The stone stopped only a hundred yards away from the two men's residences. After the landslides, the roads were blocked and impassable. Yesterday, Dr. Haas had to climb over the mountains and rocks and wade through the mud to leave his residence in order to attend Jiang Jieshi's banquet. Many important intersections have large signs warning the public that the bridges and roads ahead have been destroyed and that vehicles cannot pass. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Australia Extremely Sympathetic to China; Eggleston Issues Statement; Australian and British Policies Fully Aligned</h3>
<p>Singapore: Australia's first Minister to China, Frederic Eggleston, met with reporters this afternoon and said, "I believe that my work in China is just as valuable as the work of Minister Casey in the United States and Minister Latham in Japan. My task is to promote political, cultural, and commercial relations between China and Australia. But I would like to solemnly declare that although Australia has sent ministers abroad, its policies are still consistent with the policies of the British Empire and do not violate the policies of Australia, which closely follows and advances together with the policies of Britain. China is fighting to resist aggression, and Australians have long expressed admiration for China's perseverance and courage. My appointment as minister is an expression of the extreme sympathy and admiration of the Australian people for the Chinese people and for Chairman Jiang Jieshi." Eggleston continued, "He hopes to meet with Xu Mo and Mr. Tev Cooper before going to his post via Yangon." Eggleston visited Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places in 1929. He does not understand Oriental languages but said he is very willing to learn Chinese. Eggleston's hobbies are gardening and collecting works of art. (8th)</p>
<h3>Production Value of Southwest Provinces Increases Sevenfold</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to sources from the Gold Mining Bureau, domestic gold mining organizations have spread throughout the provinces of Sichuan, Kangding, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, and Qinghai. The larger ones are jointly operated by government and merchants, with government loans being used for large-scale mining. The gold obtained is purchased by the national bank. According to the Bureau's estimates, gold production this year can reach seven times that of before the war, valued at more than 50 million yuan at the official price. If traded on the black market, the amount would be even more staggering. Currently, 95% of gold miners still use manual panning. The Gold Mining Bureau is making efforts to encourage the use of machinery. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>Central Government Takes Steps to Regulate the Movement of Legal Tender; Experts Will Be Invited to Solicit Opinions; So That Legal Tender Can Gradually Move Inland</h3>
<p>Chongqing: After important foreign banks in Shanghai stopped the free buying and selling of foreign exchange, officials here generally believe that the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai no longer exists. The Japanese tactic of using legal tender to obtain foreign exchange can no longer be implemented. Legal tender in Shanghai can no longer be easily exchanged for foreign exchange at will, which means that it is possible for us to gradually move it inland. The Economic Committee of the Executive Yuan will invite experts to solicit opinions and study how the government should adopt subtle methods to regulate the movement of legal tender.

In the future, the exchange rate will be determined by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, which will greatly facilitate the stabilization of legal tender and the control of foreign exchange and trade. The Central Daily News carried a plan to gradually move the foreign exchange market from Hong Kong and Shanghai to the interior and to adjust the fluctuations of legal tender, and said that this plan will be discussed by the Secretariat of the Economic Conference of the Executive Yuan, convening experts for a meeting soon. The members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will return here soon. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Efforts to Raise Silkworms; Expected Increase in Raw Silk Production; Nearly 20,000 Market Loads</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The US has frozen Japanese funds, affecting the export of Japanese silk to the US. Chinese silk could take the opportunity to regain its position of twenty years ago. However, the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been occupied. Although Sichuan Province also raises silkworms, its production is limited and has always only been used for consumption in the province and is not sufficient for export. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believes that the opportunity is rare and has specified a plan to open 3,000 mu of mulberry nurseries in Sichuan this year, planting 64.5 million seedlings, increasing the production of original silkworm seeds by 10,000 sheets, and improving 800,000 sheets, with an expected increase in raw silk production of 19,715 market loads. The areas for increased production have also been designated as the five districts of Leshan, Nanchong, Santai, Guanzhong, and Hechuan, which are further divided into 56 guidance areas, each with one director and two to five roving personnel, and each area has one to three instructors to provide practical guidance to silkworm farmers to improve silk production and increase production.

<h3>Gauze Yarn: Whether the Situation Becomes Relaxed or Tense Will Determine Whether the Yarn Market Rises or Falls; The Time for Revelation Is Not Far Off, It Is Best to Observe Quietly</h3>
<p>After the yarn market's previous day's sharp rise and subsequent pullback, it continued to weaken yesterday. This was due to the activity of short sellers and the proliferation of rumors, all of which were bearish, causing anxiety among the bulls. However, generally, those with substantial financial resources are not only refusing to cut their losses on large amounts but are instead buying in and increasing their positions when prices are low. The reason for this is that the source of raw cotton is difficult to obtain, and the selling price is high. It is said that the raw material price for spinning 20-count yarn must be sold for 350 to 380 yuan per dan. One bale of cotton yarn requires three and a half dan, plus opening and handling fees of 250 to 300 yuan. Thus, the factory's cost is between 1800 and 1900 yuan. Therefore, those with strong courage are still buying in. However, the views of general speculators are vastly different, saying that as soon as the international situation becomes tense, the market price will fall sharply, and they can then buy in to make a profit. Therefore, short selling has been unusually active in the market recently, causing market volatility. However, apart from speculative purposes, the tightness or relaxation of the Far East situation is the lifeline of yarn market speculation. The next few days are indeed crucial. If the situation actually relaxes, not only can fine-staple American cotton be obtained, but even coarse-staple cotton may be obtainable. Various situations will then undergo a major reversal. If, in the end, a complete breakdown is unavoidable, not only will coarse-staple cotton still be impossible to obtain, but even fine-staple cotton may be blocked by artillery fire. Although the degree may not be so fast, speculators should temporarily observe. As of yesterday, the foundation of the yarn market still seemed stable. The market price of 20-count Double Horse was 1752 yuan, the low price was 1732 yuan, the opening price in the afternoon was 1735 yuan, falling to 1726 yuan. It was heard that the three sessions of the Exchange had recovered, and it subsequently rose to 1739 yuan at the close. The off-exchange price was already 1743 yuan. The Exchange's yarn and cloth fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. If the yarn market is solid, people will follow suit, rising and falling without much meaning.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning due to a lack of confidence, and the first session fell by 10 yuan to 1740 yuan. However, profit-takers bought in, rising to 1751 yuan. Shortly after, the Exchange's opening session trended downward, and confidence greatly eased, reaching 1737 yuan. However, a certain large firm bought in at low prices, and because raw cotton was particularly expensive, buyers still had the courage to buy, rising again to 1744 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 11 o'clock, rumors spread in the market, and short sellers sold, causing the price to weaken again to 1732 yuan. The closing price recovered slightly to 1737 yuan. It is found that the transaction volume for half a day totaled 8635 bales. Today, 580 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 155, Peers 8, 500</p>
<p>Total: 8,655</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market was volatile. Although it once fell sharply, the opening in the morning, despite the high price of foreign cotton, was met with rumors of eased U.S.-Japan negotiations, causing panic and large fluctuations among longs. Factory orders were the first to decline, and futures yarn initially remained stable, but as the Exchange fell more sharply, the September contract opened at 1650 yuan, reached a high of 1652 yuan, and then fell to a low of 1643 yuan. The October contract opened at 664 yuan and also fell. The November contract also fell from 1678 yuan to 1669 yuan. However, the fluctuations in the middle were due to buyers mainly entering into futures to hedge against spot goods, so the decline was not very large. Therefore, the noon close only fell by about 10 yuan each. In the afternoon, the opening first showed the Exchange continuing to be weak, and factory orders also felt powerless. Sellers of futures yarn were active and continued to decline. Until the close, a sudden rise occurred.</p>
<h3>Exchange Settlements May Have Flexible Measures; The Flourishing Situation of Foreign Cotton Reappears; Special Attention Is Paid to Brazilian Cotton That Has Been Weighed and Is Being Shipped</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market is seeing enthusiastic buying interest, and a flourishing situation is showing signs of resurgence. This is because banks have agreed to allow flexible measures for foreign exchange settlements. At the same time, factories believe that the purchase price of existing cotton is too high, and it is much more beneficial to directly order foreign cotton. It is also opportune that foreign cotton companies can have a large batch of Brazilian cotton that will be shipped to Shanghai in the near future, which is an opportunity that the public cannot easily give up. Therefore, the continuous orders from various factories in recent days have made foreign cotton companies overwhelmed. The total transaction volume has reached more than a thousand bales in half a day. It is expected that because the opportunity is rare, later arrivals will be more enthusiastic, and the cotton market will undoubtedly have more smooth progress.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market saw active buying interest and a sharp rise in prices. First, it rose due to buying by peers, and then due to buying on Wall Street and enthusiastic short covering. As a result, the closing price rose again by 11 to 16 points per pound compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell due to long liquidation and speculative selling. Closing prices fell by about 1 rupee each. The market situation at the opening today is expected to rise by 2.75 rupees.</p>
<p>Another report: The spot cotton situation remains strong as usual. Because American cotton is rising steadily, and it is not easy to apply for foreign exchange for overseas purchases of raw materials, the rebound in strength is the immediate recovery of the Exchange. The buyers are flocking in, and the spot price has risen sharply by more than 10 yuan. It can be seen that the stability of futures yarn, judging from its trend, is the rise of the Exchange at the close and the recovery of futures yarn, which contains good factors. Therefore, sellers should be cautious about today's continued rise. A table of transaction prices is listed below.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the lack of ships, most people are bullish. At present, the factories are still holding back a lot. Once they need to move, the market price will rise.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: South Asian Sales Remain Strong; Lun Chang Cloth Company Sees Huge Gains</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend continued to be firm, but it was once pulled back by the impact of negative rumors. The evening close rebounded again. As a result, sales prices of various cloths were generally stable. Only the British Lun Chang Cloth Company's price rose by 1 yuan per piece. Transactions on this street were limited to about 200 pieces purchased by real sales customers. Sales to customers in South Asia and the Cantonese/Hong Kong groups were relatively strong. In total, there were more than 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth from the Zhejiang East, Wenzhou, and Yongzhou groups.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The Exchange crashed, followed by a rise. Closing prices for each month fell by 1 jiao to 4.5 jiao. The current leading fine cloth fell by 3.5 jiao, medium-grade fine cloth twill fell by 1-2 jiao, and Sijunzi woolen cloth fell by 5 ya to 1 fen. The closing price for new orders with new taxes was 2 yuan and 2.8 jiao. Ito and other foreign firms bought more than 300 pieces of woolen cloth and various local fine cloth twills in the afternoon. Dyeing factories also purchased more than 200 pieces.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, there were 870 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Hong Kong and 55 pieces shipped to Kalga.</p>
<h3>Securities: Signs of Disaffection from Fu; Strong Attraction of Domestic and Foreign Securities; Categories B, C, D, Geng, and Wu All Rose by More Than 1 Yuan; Famous Foreign Stocks Also Reached New Highs</h3>
<p>Public bonds in the gray market yesterday showed that there was a symbol of Japan's exit from the Axis powers. It was speculated that the US-Japan talks must also be close, and that there is hope for peace in China and Japan. Because of this centrifugal force, it became the attraction of domestic bonds. The market sentiment was greatly excited. With continuous absorption, Category C broke through the 72 yuan mark, and Category E also reached over 70 yuan. Even Category B, which had just been drawn, was still within 3 yuan the day before yesterday and is now over 4 yuan. The excellent market price is a new high price after interest payment. The future has progress and no retreat, but a reversal of the wind is inevitable. Yesterday morning, Yi Chang, De Long, Hong Da, Run De, Jiu Cheng, Xie and Yuan all sold one after another. The noon close was 3-5 jiao better. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Run De continued to buy. Da Hua, Yong Kang, Da Zhong, and Ding Kang either added to their long positions or covered their short positions. Yi Tai and Lian Yi continued to sell. Tong Kang and Tong Shun slightly sold off. Xie Xing and Yuan Deli settled out. For a time, the market was high. After the interest payment, it was never seen. As a result, the market price rose by 7 jiao to 1.4 yuan across the board. The total transaction volume for the whole day was about 2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 550 shares of ABC Innerwear Company were traded at a price of 12.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the Public Chamber of Commerce continued to rise, and prices were exceptionally firm. Many famous stocks reached new high prices. Rubber stocks were also very prosperous. The most rising stocks were Yingda, Qu Ying Zha Hua, Lang Gezhi and Rubber, etc.</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Electricity Continues to Fall; Spot Price Enters the 9,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw the October futures continue to trend flat, only 8 yuan high or low, and finally continue to fall by a small 5 yuan, with 7-800 liang traded. The spot opening was still above 1,000 liang. Because it is spot trading, the supply and demand chips are slightly unbalanced, and huge waves are easy to rise. However, a fierce decline unfolded, and the price has broken into the 9,000 yuan mark. It is said that the US-Japan talks have caused a certain atmosphere between China and Japan. It is also heard that the gold price in Hong Kong continues to fall. Local Hong Kong, Tianjin, Chaozhou and other customer groups are selling out. The sentiments of all parties are even more weak and difficult to revive. Starting in the morning, Chengji sold 10 liang to Xianghe first, for 9,150 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. It continued to decline. Yutaiyan sold 10 liang to Xianghe for 9,100 yuan, and another 10 liang, and Chengji sold 20 liang, Lianyu bought in for 9,060 yuan, Chengji sold 30 liang to Xianghe, and Wanfeng 10 liang, 9,005 yuan. At the same price, Xianghe bought another 20 liang from Tianyuan. Then the sellers waited and saw a rebound immediately. Xianghe bought 50 liang each from Yutai Feng for 9,060 yuan, and another 50 liang each from Dafeng and Defu for 9,100 yuan, and another 50 liang from Defu for 9,110 yuan. The Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs sold out, and the upward trend stabilized. Defu sold 50 liang to Xianghe and 10 liang to Tianyuan for 9,100 yuan. Yongcheng sold 10 liang for 9,090 yuan. Defu sold 20 liang for 9,100 yuan, all bought by Xianghe. Defu sold 6 and 10 liang to Xinyuan, and Chi Da 20 liang for 9,080 yuan. Xinyuan resold 10 liang to Chengda. Defu sold 60 liang to Xianghe, and Mingyan sold 50 liang to Xianghe, all for 9,090 yuan. Defu resold 10 liang to Xianghe for 9,080 yuan. Bang Yifeng sold 50 liang to Shihe for 9,050 yuan. Defu resold 10 liang to Tianyuan at the same price, and another 20 liang for 9,030 yuan. Defu bought in and continued to sell to Tianyuan 10 liang for 9,010 yuan. Chengda sold 10 liang to Tianyuan for 9,000 yuan. Decheng asked for sale, and immediately stepped down another 80 yuan before selling 10 liang each to Tianyuan and Xiang Xing Yong, down to 8,920 yuan. At 11:50, suddenly saw Xianghe come to buy in Fuka Yong 10 liang for 8,930 yuan. Later, there were fewer sellers, so it was raised by 170 yuan in 2 minutes before continuing to buy in 20 liang from Chengji for 9,100 yuan, and then 50 liang from Yongcheng and 30 liang from a certain gold shop for 9,120 yuan. Defu sold at a limited price. Xianghe's purchase was full, so it was shouted down to 9,000 yuan again in 1 minute, and finally saw Tianyuan sell 10 liang to Shihe for 8,980 yuan, 200 yuan less than the daily squeeze, with 230 yuan high or low. The market price of the gold shop's own brand gold was 9,050 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 200 yuan. The price of decorative gold was also 20 yuan lower, for 920 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Can't Bear to Look Back</p>
<p>The opening price for the October gold contract (10 liang) at 9:15 was 6,865 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan. Heshneg first asked to sell, bought in by Tianyuan 30 liang, and then by Yifeng and Decheng, so from 6,862 yuan, gradually rose to 6,870 yuan. Defu sold out, and it lost to 6,865 yuan. The noon closing was 6,870 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan from the previous day. The difference on that day was only 8 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Decorative Gold Fell by Two Small Increments</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver shop decorative gold per liang, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, fell by 10 yuan at 10 o'clock in the morning, and then by another 10 yuan at 11:30, falling back to 920 yuan (purchase reduced by 50 yuan), a decrease of 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Is Quiet; Let's See How the Bulls and Bears Settle</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices and the HSBC small rights counter price were fixed. The black market for British and American exchange rates has been difficult to develop. The market price of 2.859275 for British exchange and 4.84375 for American exchange has gradually become quiet. The reporter inquired in many ways. At present, Chinese speculators have a net long of less than 1 million US dollars, with 1.2-3 million US dollars long in September contracts and 3-400,000 US dollars short. What price will this transaction be settled at? It is not known whether the Stabilization Fund has discussed this. If it is settled at the price of 5.4375 sold by exporters to the 14 local banks, it will cause huge losses to speculators. If it is settled at the transaction price at that time (around 5 yuan), the banks are afraid it will be difficult to allow it. Therefore, it depends on whether the black market will exist in the future, or whether it will be settled at a price set by the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund.</p>
<h3>Grains: Although Rice Merchants Will Use False Excuses, They Will Ultimately Be No Match for the General Trend; Yesterday's Market Price Has Already Seen a Small Recovery</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market has turned into a volatile situation with many changes. Because of the sudden surge in foreign exchange and other issues in the previous dynasty, yesterday's market saw a decline again. The market fell sharply by 3-4 yuan in the morning. The reason for this is nothing more than the thick reserves and people's fear. Therefore, once the price is raised, the real sales stagnate again. At the same time, general profit-takers take advantage of the high prices and emerge. Skin ball business is also fading. Therefore, the market lacks a foundation and is often shaky. At the beginning of the morning market, in the absence of inquiries, the shouting price was low. The small grain of the Bank Zhan was the most tired, opening only 109 yuan. Then there were more and more chips, and the market shape became more and more tired. If the small grain of the Bank Zhan fell to 107 yuan, the outer Zhan fell to 106 yuan, and the tired wind was even stronger before the evening market. There was a shouting price of 104.5 yuan, which was 12-13 yuan lower than the official selling price of 117 yuan in the market. Therefore, some rice shops in the market have automatically reduced to 108-9 yuan. Other goods have been devalued one after another. Thus, all the way down, until the close of the market, a wind of replenishment suddenly rose, and the recovery was slightly tighter, and the recovery was 1-2 yuan, but it was still 2-3 yuan lower than the previous market. The closing price of Saigon No. 1 was 121.5 yuan to 120 yuan, No. 2 was 111 yuan to 110 yuan, Siam Transport No. 1 was 119 yuan, Siam Er No. 2 was 105 yuan to 103 yuan, He Fojian was 115 yuan, Huojiao was 116 yuan, Mindangjue was 111 yuan to 110 yuan, Yin Zhan Xiaojiao was 108 yuan, Outer Zhan was 107 yuan, Broken Jian was 82.5 yuan to 80 yuan, and Yinghua Si Xiaojiao was also in the process of stepping down. The spot goods opened yesterday at 135 yuan, and the road goods were as small as 133.5 yuan, Siam Transport No. 2 was 128 yuan, and Broken Rice was initially opened at 94 yuan, and then from 93.5 yuan to 92.8 yuan, with a transaction of more than 700 tons. Direct transactions in the afternoon were also suppressed by 1-2 yuan. The total number of spot rice transactions for the whole day was more than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Due to the slightly larger amount of arrival, the thick and thin Japonica rice market was affected by the foreign rice, resulting in a sluggish sales and loose sales, and the selling price fell by more than 2 yuan. The opening price of Nanhai early indica rice was 150 yuan, and it was reduced to 148 yuan. Wuxi Gaojing was about 150 yuan, Pudong New Jing high goods was 152 yuan, and the general market was 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice alone continued to be beautiful by 1-2 yuan due to the scarcity and fragrant taste. The opening price of Hong Kong Baiyuan was as high as 127 yuan, and the second was 123-4 yuan, and the glutinous tea was mediocre, still at 113 yuan, reduced to 110 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Vermicelli Foreign Exchange Settlement Is Not Yet Ready</h3>
<p>The vermicelli market was stimulated by the crazy drop in foreign rice and rumors. The market was tired and weak, and the selling atmosphere was very strong. It seemed to be following the failure of foreign rice. However, in the current Mid-Autumn Festival Mooncake season, the daily real sales of local customers often reached 13-4,000 bags. In addition, the customer's skin ball had 2-30,000 bags of transactions per day. Although foreign wheat can be settled in foreign exchange, the foreign exchange settlement of foreign vermicelli has not yet been completed. Therefore, the market has been fluctuating and hovering in recent days. The market price has always been hovering outside 30 yuan for several weeks, and has not been able to fall directly like foreign rice. However, yesterday's market finally saw a sharp drop of about 5-8 jiao due to the timid sentiment and the sale of large accounts, but it was still raised by the customer's low-price replenishment in the middle, and the closing price was restored. The opening price of Jinlong West Zhan in the morning was 30.06 jiao, up to 31.05 yuan, and the afternoon closing fork recovered by a small 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, floating highs and big buyers competed to sell down to 30.025 jiao. Before the evening closing, the former goods were shouted higher again, Jinlong East Zhan 31.4 yuan, 31 yuan in the afternoon, Cannon 32.4 jiao, Banana 32.2 jiao, Five Swallow 31.6 jiao, local flour stock and production are both dry, still standing at about 34 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: The Decline in Edible Oil Is Getting Worse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in edible oil became more widespread. Raw soybean oil has been arriving in Shanghai one after another. Another 4,000 barrels and 16,000 cans have arrived and been imported. Driven by the rumored selling trend, the sentiment became more weak, and all parties started to depreciate and sell. As a result, the market fell sharply. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil fell by 8-9 yuan more than before. Tongshi sold more than 7,000 dan of Xiajiao Qing oil from Daguo Factory in September. The opening price was 173 yuan, the highest was 173.5 yuan, the lowest was 162 yuan, and the closing price was 163.5 yuan. Also, the opening price of Caiyou from Rihua Factory was 169 yuan, the highest was 171.5 yuan, the lowest was 161.5 yuan, and the closing price was 163.5 yuan. Spot goods were rarely favored, only sporadic openings.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Exchange Can Be Supplied; Sugar Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because foreign exchange could be supplied in the sugar market, the sentiment weakened and the price turned loose. The spot goods from the Guild's Liu Pan, the import of 24 rough white in August, was 133.3 yuan to 35 yuan, in July 132.5 yuan-34.5 yuan-32 yuan to 34 yuan, small two yuan, Dutch red spot was 122 yuan, the same degree of decline. Taikoo's carriage white B mark was 162 yuan, HX mark was 143.5 yuan, small two yuan to one and a half yuan, H mark carriage red was 113 yuan, 15 yuan, 17 yuan, the company's futures contract for the delivery of 24 rough white on September 20 was 134.5 yuan, small to 31.2 jiao, and then recovered to 33 yuan to 33.4 jiao, a small 1.2 yuan, the 30-day period was 134 yuan, 33.1 jiao-16.5 yuan-35.4 jiao, a total of more than 31,000 bags of futures were traded, and more than 3,000 bags of spot goods were traded.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Stone Wharf Circle Has Not Yet Formed</h3>
<p>The new goods of Guilin cinnamon have been reported to be in short supply this year, and the production price is exceptionally high. This is worth the stage. The first batch of five boxes has been shipped to Shen for testing. Yesterday, the goods were sampled. The quality of the goods is still good. Although the lines reluctantly picked up the price due to the small quantity, it is still difficult to reach the cost. As a result, no transaction was made. From the perspective of the towel market, the price is already high. If it is raised to the peak again, it is feared that it will not be very suitable.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Joint Agricultural Bank to Handle Foreign Exchange and Export Settlement Matters Following Order; Crossover of Two Banks Responsible for Operations</h3>
<p>Hawkins and Mackay Return to Shanghai Yesterday with Detailed Instructions</p>
<p>Following the fourteen allied banks, the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Joint Agricultural Bank officially received an order from the Stabilization Board yesterday to handle foreign exchange applications and export settlement matters for customers. All foreign exchange businesses of the four banks will be centralized and handled by the Sino-Japanese Joint Bank. The scope of its operations includes the import of foreign exchange for goods approved by the Stabilization Board, small-scale import trade, and foreign exchange supply for a small number of individuals. The Sino-Japanese Joint Bank can also handle the settlement and sale of export drafts. Furthermore, to facilitate the Stabilization Board's understanding of the actual situation, the two banks must regularly report the settlement status to the board. Chinese-owned banks such as Dalu, Zhongnan, Kenye, Xingye, Jincheng, Shanghai, Overseas Chinese, Dongya, Zhongxing, Xinhua, and Siming have already reached agreements with the Sino-Japanese Joint Bank. When importers request foreign exchange, the banks will transfer the request to the Sino-Japanese Joint Bank for approval from the Stabilization Board. However, the original handling bank must bear full responsibility for the approved foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Hawkins, etc., Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkins, General Manager of the Mercantile Bank, and Mr. Mackay, Supervisor of the National City Bank of the United States, who were summoned from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 29th of last month to participate in a Stabilization Board meeting to discuss methods for supplying foreign exchange for essential goods, have returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:30 pm aboard the American liner President Cleveland, having completed their work in Hong Kong. They will, in the shortest possible time, use an informal meeting format to instruct designated Chinese and foreign banks to comply with the Stabilization Board's decisions on managing the Shanghai foreign exchange market.</p>
<h3>Two French Warships Suddenly Entered Port, Sailed from the Yangtze River to Shanghai for Repairs at the Jiangnan Shipyard</h3>
<p>After the expansion of the European War, the French warships stationed in China, except for one shallow-water gunboat remaining in this city, all sailed to Vietnam. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 pm, two French warships were suddenly seen arriving at the port. The ship names were Fr.G.B.Beryl and Fr.G.B.Valeureux. They sailed directly to the Gaochangmiao waterfront on the southern Huangpu River and anchored. It is said that the two ships came to Shanghai from the Yangtze River. They are small in tonnage, the hulls are old, and the gun positions have also been removed. Generally, due to years of disrepair, they sailed to Shanghai to be repaired in the docks of the French-owned Jiangnan Shipyard.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Troops Take Over</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a partial movement of the French Defense Forces stationed in Shanghai. Two hundred and seventy-four soldiers from French-owned Vietnam arrived in Shanghai last Monday aboard the Bena Saint Pierre of the French Post Boat Company to replace the Vietnamese soldiers who are about to leave Shanghai and be transferred to Vietnam. They are now stationed in the French Defense Forces barracks on Avenue Albert and other locations. Officials from the French Consulate General in Shanghai have externally stated that this batch of Vietnamese soldiers came to strengthen the defense within the French Concession, which is not our understanding. They claim that this is merely an ordinary transfer of personnel.</p>
<h3>Tai Tuo Pang's Trial Continued Yesterday, Sentencing Set for the 12th; Interrogation of Impersonating Fingerprints, Concealing the Truth; Multiple Evidence Presented in the Case of Stealing and Selling Public Property</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Mr. Ludun, Special Commissioner of the U.S. Court for China, opened court today (the 10th) to continue the trial of Tai Tuo Pang, former Deputy Executive Officer of the Commissioner's Office, for stealing and selling public property. Three witnesses testified that the defendant had debts at several hotels and nightclubs.</p>
<p>Concealing the Truth</p>
<p>After the questioning, the Commissioner set the sentencing for the 12th of this month, and then continued the trial on the charge of impersonating another person's fingerprints on the resume submitted by the defendant to the U.S. Department of Justice, concealing the truth. The witnesses who testified in court today were one employee each from the Fa Lansi Nightclub, the International Hotel, and the Dids Cafe, stating that the defendant owed debts ranging from over two hundred yuan to over one thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Shaking Head to Signal</p>
<p>When the defendant's lawyer, Wu Lushi, wanted to question the witnesses, Tai Tuo Pang shook his head to signal him to stop. Then, Prosecutor Hill of the Commissioner's Office summarized the process of the defendant stealing and selling government-owned pistols and ammunition, and presented multiple pieces of evidence. His conclusion was that the defendant was heavily in debt due to his fondness for nightlife, and therefore resorted to this.</p>
<p>Appearing Quite Uneasy</p>
<p>When the prosecutor was narrating eloquently, Tai Tuo Pang looked at him intently, appearing quite uneasy, his lips moving as if he wanted to respond. Ultimately, the defendant's lawyer spoke, making some arguments regarding the defendant's debts and Luo Senpang's handling of the sale of firearms.

<h3>Gasoline and Oils Arriving as Usual; More Detailed Reports on Supply Situation Expected Next Week</h3>
<p>The supply of gasoline and oils in Shanghai is expected to continue to arrive as usual. According to the head of an American oil company in this city this morning (the 10th), more detailed news about this matter can be obtained next week, at which time the situation of the oil supply in Shanghai will be clarified. Rumors that gasoline and fuel oil may be in short supply have spread throughout the city. In fact, some people are hoarding oil to profit. Therefore, each oil company has implemented new restrictions starting this month to prevent gasoline from being hoarded or prices from soaring. Currently, Shanghai is continuously receiving a normal supply of gasoline and oils, and it is expected that they will continue to arrive in the future. Although each oil company has implemented restrictions to prevent hoarding, it does not intend to sell gasoline by the carload.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Steward Seriously Injured in Beating</h3>
<p>An Italian man, Rafael, 35 years old, serves as a steward on the Italian post boat Conte Verde. The ship came to Shanghai a few days ago. Rafael disembarked the ship the night before last and spent the night playing in a dance hall. At 7:00 am yesterday, he was returning home when he was suddenly stopped by six white-skinned teenagers near the Tilanqiao neighborhood in Hongkou. They held sticks and other objects and violently beat Rafael. As a result, he was struck in the head and seriously injured, collapsing in a pool of blood. The perpetrators fled in all directions upon seeing this. A patrolman discovered him, summoned a car, and sent him to the Gōngjì Hospital for treatment. He is also investigating the circumstances of the incident.</p>
<h3>Japanese Detective Yamaguchi Dies of Serious Injuries; Said to Have Made Enemies While Handling Cases; Accomplices Ambush for Revenge</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reports that Yamaguchi Muneyo, a Japanese detective from the Public Concession Police Department, was ambushed on the morning of the 9th at the corner of Gordon Road and Penang Road, sustaining three gunshot wounds. He was rushed to Fumin Hospital, where two bullets were removed. One bullet, however, had penetrated his spine and could not be removed. He succumbed to his injuries at 6:30 am on the 10th. His wife was by his side, and he left behind a daughter who is only three years old. Yamaguchi's body has been moved to the Honganji Temple on Zhapu Road for a memorial service. The date of the funeral has not yet been determined. The Continental Daily News also reports that, according to officials from the Police Department, Yamaguchi was 34 years old and had been working for the Police Department for 13 years. He had just been transferred from the Central Precinct to the Gordon Road Precinct eleven days ago. This assassination is believed to be due to Yamaguchi making enemies while handling a certain case in the past. The assassin was attempting to avenge him for his accomplices. According to the police officers investigating this case, this is the only motive for the shooting, as Yamaguchi has no connection to politics.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Food Cooperative Association Resolves to Temporarily Cease Operations; Dissenting Members Account for Less Than Two Percent</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Food Cooperative Association has assisted the general public in handling small-amount fixed-price rice, achieving remarkable results. Now, the association believes that the current Shanghai rice problem has been resolved, and it seems unnecessary for the association to continue operations. Therefore, it was resolved at the eighth board meeting to temporarily cease operations, return the funds according to regulations, and solicit opinions from all members. If there are any objections, please submit them in writing within one week. If the written objections received do not account for two-tenths of the total membership, the board of directors will handle the cessation of operations. Now that the deadline has passed, only six people have raised objections. Considering that there are 336 current members, this accounts for less than two percent. It was resolved at the ninth board meeting to proceed with the temporary cessation of operations. Once the procedures are completed, the funds will be returned according to regulations. If there is a need for service in the future, it can be carried out again based on past experience.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shipping Vessels Are Preparing; Shanghai-Zhejiang-Fujian Will Resume Shipping; Freight Rates Greatly Increase, Each Ton Requires 2,500 Yuan; Customs Will Allow Certain Goods to Be Transported to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>According to news this morning (the 10th), fifteen foreign shipping vessels are currently preparing to sail to Fuzhou and other coastal ports in Fujian Province, as the Japanese army has withdrawn from Fuzhou and other areas.</p>
<p>These ships originally sailing to Fuzhou ceased operations after the Japanese army landed on the coast of Fujian Province and occupied Fuzhou in April. The date of resumption of shipping is not yet known, but it is believed that several of them are currently preparing to sail within a few days. There have already been inquiries about transporting goods from Shanghai to Fuzhou and various ports in Fujian Province, but the freight rates will be greatly increased, estimated at around 2,500 yuan per ton, which is more than</p>
<p>double the previous rate.</p>

<h3>Wu Zhesheng Kidnapping Case; Police Arrest Driver Who Used to Drive for Ding Xishan's Japanese Advisor; Jointly Arrested with Japanese and Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>Wu Zhesheng, General Manager of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, was kidnapped on the 7th of this month at 7:15 am from his residence at No. 11, Hua'an Lane, No. 1088, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, by more than ten kidnappers in two cars with black license plates No. 2235 and No. 3724, who broke into Wu's bedroom and kidnapped Wu. To this day, there is no news. The car used by the kidnappers, No. 2235, was discovered at around 10:30 am on the same morning at the intersection of No. 1626, Jing'an Temple Road, Public Concession. The responsible police station, considering that the incident occurred in the French Concession, notified the French police station to drive the car back for investigation. It is now learned that the French police station, based on the origin of the car, arrested a suspect in the kidnapping case. The process of solving the case is as follows: after discovering the car, the French police investigated and found that the car, No. 2235, belonged to Todo, the Japanese advisor in Ding Xishan's army stationed in Beiqiao, and was usually driven by the driver Yan Fulai (from Ningbo, 45 years old). The French police, together with the Japanese, went to Beiqiao according to the address and arrested the driver Yan Fulai. Jin Zhihe, the factory doctor of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory who witnessed the incident at the scene, went to the police station to identify him. It was confirmed that Yan Fulai was driving the car at the scene when Wu was kidnapped, making Yan a major suspect. However, when the French police interrogated Yan, he claimed that he had joined Ding Xishan's army last November to drive for Todo, but he absolutely denied being involved in the kidnapping case. He claimed that he had gotten up on that morning, gone to a teahouse for tea, and returned after breakfast, still seeing the car parked in the garage at more than 7 o'clock. As for how the car was stolen later, he did not know. Although the car's engine key was on him, perhaps others could also make a copy, and so on. The French police, considering the seriousness of the case, have now detained Yan at the police station to await a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Further Arrests Made in the Case of Shooting a Gambling Den Shareholder; Three Criminals Confess Without Regret</h3>
<p>Zhang Kangmei, a shareholder of the Yongyuan gambling den at No. 121, Lane 1912, Zhuanbang, Jing'an Temple Road, who lived at No. 6, Le'an Lane, Jessfield Road, was shot and assassinated at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Difeng Road on July 28, 1939, due to a gambling den dispute. The police station had previously arrested the criminals Mao Xiangyun and Wang Shouzhang and sent them to the First Special Court, where Mao was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and Wang to life imprisonment. An arrest warrant was issued to arrest the accomplices Liu Jincheng and others who were still at large for strict handling of the case. Two years later, the Chinese detective Li Yinmin and Chen Jinsheng from the New Gate Police Station learned that Liu Jincheng, also known as Da Maotou, was hiding in Room 311 of the New World Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. They secretly went and arrested Liu, along with his accomplices Yin Jiajia from Jiangyin, Pu Jieshang and Zhang Zhensheng from Baoshan, Zhou Tiebao from Jiangbei, and Gao Linbao from Haimen, totaling six people, who were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. When questioned, Liu Jincheng confessed that this case was discussed in the French Park beforehand, deciding to assassinate Zhang Kangmei. At that time, Wang Shouzhang and Zhou Tiebao each held a pistol, and he fired the shots, killing Zhang. Zhou Tiebao confessed that Zhang Kangmei had a feud with the shareholder Wang Shouzhang, so he went and shot Zhang. He was only watching the scene at the time and did not hold a gun. Judge Shi instructed the defendants to be detained to await rescheduling and review.</p>
<h3>Divorce of Elderly Couple, Daughter's Suicide, Continued Inquiry</h3>
<p>The news item "Elderly Couple Divorces, Daughter Commits Suicide" published on the 9th of this month contains some inaccuracies. According to letters from Zhao Jingzhai and his divorced wife Ding, as well as the owner of Mintian Rice Store Tang Huaxing, the true facts are supplemented as follows: (1) Zhao Jingzhai and his wife Ding signed a divorce agreement on the 6th without any conditions and without any loss of 1,000 yuan in compensation. (2) Ding is a doctor who "serves in the hospital and does not return day or night, only returning home to collect clothes and to diagnose illnesses with the owner of Mintian Store, with evidence such as fever records and prescriptions." "Master Tang has been ill for a long time, and Ding was treating him. Because the air in his room was not very sufficient, he ordered Biyu's room and Master Tang's room to be temporarily exchanged." There was no adultery, and there were no major disputes between the couple that led to the split. (3) When the daughter, Biyu, was packing her clothes, she found the divorce agreement in the closet. Upon seeing it, she felt ashamed and indignant, and committed suicide by taking poison. It was not due to the mother and daughter breaking up due to the daughter regretting the agreement. According to Ding's letter, her daughter committed suicide because she failed her academic grades, leading to a short-sighted act of taking poison.</p>

<h3>Stallholders in the French Concession Request Exemption from Increased License Fees</h3>
<p>The license fees for stallholders in various vegetable markets in the French Concession were only 2.5 yuan per month before the war, but have now increased to three types: 7.5 yuan, 10.5 yuan, and 13.5 yuan. It is now heard that the Municipal Council plans to further increase the license fees by 50% to 115% starting this month, causing panic among tens of thousands of stallholders in the French Concession. It is learned that the stallholders have elected representatives to discuss the matter yesterday. After discussion, they decided to jointly send a letter to the Municipal Council requesting an exemption from the increase in order to reduce the burden.</p>

The grenade did not explode. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. It is learned that after the incident, the Japanese blocked the Suzhou River bridges and reopened them at about 1:00 am yesterday. The Japanese military police mobilized to search because the man who threw the grenade had escaped into Cishan Lane, Yuanfang Road, Huade Road. Therefore, they immediately surrounded the lane and searched house by house. As a result, it is reported that three or four suspects were arrested.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ship Sails South to Load Supplies; Expands Cargo Capacity to Load Raw Materials in Thailand and Metals in the Philippines; Two More Soviet Ships to Arrive in Shanghai for Repairs Soon</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, it is reported that the two Soviet ships, including the Kovda, which arrived in Shanghai in mid-March this year for repairs in dry dock, have been modified to accommodate more cargo.</p>
<p>The modifications have now been completed, and the ships will leave port early next week, possibly heading to Thailand and Manila to load relief supplies. It is expected that after arriving in Thailand, these two ships will load strategic raw materials in accordance with the commercial treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Thailand in April. In Manila, they may load a large number of machine parts and metals that were held up in Manila two years ago due to the American embargo on the Soviet Union. Now that the American embargo on the Soviet Union has been lifted,</p>
<p>their export is permitted. It is also reported that another Soviet ship, the Food Industry, which is currently being repaired in Shanghai, was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai last week, but due to the need for further repairs, it is still in dry dock and will leave port in three months. According to reports this morning (10th), two more Soviet ships are expected to arrive here within the next ten days for</p>
<p>repairs and refurbishment.</p>
<p>However, the names of these two ships are not yet known. In addition, Su Levichu, the manager of the Soviet shipping company Hongyun Navigation Bureau in this city, fell from a gangplank while inspecting the departure of the repaired Soviet ship Gorky at the Yangshupu Shipyard last week, fracturing his left foot. He is still being treated at Hong En Hospital, and doctors believe that Su's left foot may need to be amputated.</p>

Mr. Yang of Qihoutang had previously donated one hundred yuan. Today, Mr. Yang's respected father, moved by the article "An Anonymous Elder Encourages Students" (original text can be found in the "Chunqiu" column of this newspaper on the 8th), donated another 500 yuan, which is deeply appreciated. The Xinya Bookstore on Henan Road has decided to recommend several staff trainees to this newspaper to apply for further studies. Today, the owner of the bookstore specially donated 100 yuan to benefit the employees and students, which is admirable. Mr. An of Zheng Guanghe Company raised more than 1,700 yuan for student aid, and his enthusiasm and perseverance are commendable.

<p>Qihoutang Yang</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have been studying for eight years without making any progress. Having read the article on student aid funds in your newspaper, I was deeply moved. I think of my fellow youth who, with the protection of their fathers and brothers, can study with peace of mind, while other students are trapped by their environment and unable to fulfill their wishes. I reported this to my father and wanted to contribute a small amount to help, so I asked him to allocate 100 yuan from the funds given by my late grandmother, receipt number 394 on August 4th, to do my part. This morning, my father read the article by the anonymous elder in your newspaper, and his encouragement to the students in the last paragraph was profound and far-reaching. If they can act accordingly, then benefiting the community will be limitless. He immediately handed over 500 yuan to be sent to you and asked that it be included under the student aid fund and a receipt issued (Qihoutang Yang), I would be fortunate. Yang Zhuodun bowed on September 8th.</p>
<p>Xinya Bookstore</p>
<p>To the Editor: This time, your office has gone to great lengths to organize a student aid fund for bookstore employees, benefiting the employees and students, which is truly significant. The enthusiasm of your colleagues is also commendable. We now present 100 yuan, hoping that it will be included in the next student aid fund. The amount is small, but it is a small gesture to respond to your righteous act and express our feelings. This is addressed to the Shen Bao. Sincerely, Xinya Bookstore.</p>
<p>An Junjing Raised Funds</p>
<p>To the Editor: The student aid fund organized by your newspaper benefits the poor, which is truly significant. We wholeheartedly express our support. We are now sending all the funds raised to the best of our ability, in order to contribute to the cause and provide a small benefit to children who have lost the opportunity to study. A total of 1,757 yuan. An Ji of Zheng Guanghe Company, No. 44 Fuzhou Road, bowed.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Gift for Student Aid</p>
<p>To the Editor: My second son, Zeyi, has reached his full month. I received congratulatory gifts from friends. In this time of national crisis and economic hardship, I dare not do anything, so I declined all of them. However, some congratulatory gifts were firmly refused. I estimate that there are more than 200 yuan. I am now aware that your newspaper is organizing a student aid fund for the poor, benefiting young people and cultivating the foundation of the nation, which I greatly admire. Therefore, I specially collected 300 yuan and sent it to people to benefit friends and express my small intention to support. Jiang Guozhang bowed, September 4, 30th year.</p>

<h3>Ministry Order for the National Southwestern Associated University Teachers College to Add Two Junior Classes</h3>
<p>(Kunming News) The National Southwestern Associated University and the Provincial Department of Education recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to issue regulations for the establishment of junior classes in the Teachers College, in order to cultivate teachers for junior high schools and simplified normal schools in various provinces. The Yunnan Provincial Department was designated to send 80 qualified students from the province to the junior classes of the National Southwestern Associated University Teachers College. The National Southwestern Associated University Teachers College was approved by the Ministry to establish two junior classes, offering courses in physics, chemistry, history, and geography. The Provincial Department of Education is currently inquiring with the National Southwestern Associated University Teachers College about the opening date and actively preparing for the sending of students. It is said that the Teachers Training Department, which the Provincial Department of Education had previously agreed with the National Southwestern Associated University to establish, has the same regulations as the junior classes, and it seems that there is no need to repeat the establishment of the Teachers Training Department since the Ministry of Education has ordered national university teachers colleges to establish junior classes.</p>

<h3>International Lober Cup Doubles: China vs. Portugal in Today's Final; At 1:00 PM This Afternoon, Wu-Li vs. Ke-Ma; China Defeated the United States in Straight Sets Yesterday</h3>
<p>In this year's International Lober Cup Doubles Championship, the preliminary match between China and the United States, originally scheduled for the day before yesterday, was delayed due to rain. It was temporarily decided to hold a makeup match at the Association Stadium at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Few people knew about it beforehand. In yesterday's match, China was represented by Wang Wenzheng and Li Guofan, while the United States was represented by Shi Guiya and Robert Chi. Wang and Li have strong strength and tacit cooperation. In contrast, Shi Guiya's sharpness has diminished since losing Carson's assistance, and although Mr. Lao is a veteran of twenty years ago, he is already old and fading. Without even making contact, the outcome was already decided. In yesterday's match, China swept away the United States in a one-sided situation, advancing to the second round of the week. The entire match took only more than 30 minutes. There were a total of six sliding games. China won five, and the United States won only one. In addition, the second round match between China and Portugal is scheduled to be held at the same location at 5:00 PM this afternoon. China will still be represented by Wang and Li. The Portuguese team is likely to be represented by Kela Shamasanaer, and victory is within reach.</p>

<h3>Sino-Portuguese Mini Football Tournament: Organized by Both Sides' Players</h3>
<p>Regarding the Willie Dunn Sino-Portuguese International Mini Football Tournament, according to Mr. Qian Willie, the donor of the Willie Dunn tournament from the Xinyuan Tobacco Factory, the Xinyuan Sports Association was organized in the past for the physical health of hundreds of employees in the factory. This time, with the urging of his friend Mr. Wang Ruilong, the Coco Cup Charity Mini Football Championship was initiated. As it is a good deed, all preparatory matters related to income and expenditure are planned by the poor education hospital authorities in order to show great faith. In addition to promoting this charity competition and producing trophies and prizes, the factory will not provide any other advice. As for this Willie Dunn tournament, it is in response to the request of the Hualian team members to donate a champion prize and has nothing to do with the factory. It is not organized by the factory. According to Mr. Cai, the organizer of the Hualian team, Mr. Qian is a person who is enthusiastic about sports and charity. The Willie Dunn tournament is completely initiated by the players of both sides. No third party is manipulating it. It has nothing to do with charity. It is not organized by the Poor Children's Education Center or Xinyuan. It is completely organized by the players themselves.</p>

<h3>My Child</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>We've been married for five years and now have two and a half children. The older one, a boy, is four, the younger one, a girl, is two, and the half one will be born soon. Normally, with a spacious house, taking care of a few children wouldn't be a problem, but now it's extremely difficult. When trying to rent a house, we always run into the "no children allowed" sign. Luckily, we rented the house before having children, so the landlord is too embarrassed to ask us to leave. However, in such a small room, it's hard to find a good place for the children. If they're on the street, there's the danger of getting lost or being hit by a vehicle; if they're at home, they'll either tear up letters or step into the spittoon, and they're always getting into trouble. But I feel bad if I tell them to stay still.</p>
<p>Children are great imitators. They watch every word and action of adults and imitate them when they have the chance. For example, many people in my house play mahjong, so when they get a stamp or something that looks like a bamboo tile, they throw it down with their little hands and shout "Pong!" The older child heard some vulgar curses on the street, and when he got home, he started cursing his dad. It shows that a child's character is influenced by the environment at least as much as by education.</p>
<p>Children's interests are completely different from adults'. They are most interested in small animals like dogs and cats and things that move. Adults may not be as interested in these things, so it's foolish for adults to force their children to like what they like. Children also have their own special understanding of everything. Once, the older child saw his dad's tie and said, "That's Daddy's tail," because he saw that cats and dogs have tails, so he thought that the thing Daddy was dragging around must also be a tail. Another time, when the younger child had just woken up and opened her eyes, the older child said, "Sister's eyes are awake." This kind of understanding is sometimes wrong, but sometimes even more correct than adults'. When they ask questions because they can't understand something, it's the best opportunity for education.</p>
<p>The most common way to stop children from making mistakes is to hit them, but this method is mostly only effective for a short time. After being beaten and crying, children often don't understand the reason for the beating, and instead focus on how to avoid being beaten, sometimes even treating the beating as a duty. Once, some children were putting the juice of a wild grass on their hands, saying that applying this would make their palms not hurt when they were hit. It shows that the effect of hitting is very subtle.</p>
<p>I think the best way to correct children's mistakes is to encourage them, using their most familiar playmates as examples. For example, if a child steals something to eat, you can tell him that a certain child doesn't steal and that another child got sick from eating too much. If you tell him these facts over and over again, he will naturally feel that he shouldn't do it and correct his behavior in the future. Human beings have an inherent tendency towards goodness and progress. Actively guiding them in this direction is more effective than passively punishing them afterwards. Many children who are used to being beaten develop a kind of slavishness.</p>
<p>I think the most worrying thing for parents is that schools and society are too separated. The attitude towards life that children learn in school is not only different from what they see outside the school gates, or even after school, but often the exact opposite. This has a huge impact on their weak minds. They will also become very obedient, very hypocritical, and have two-faced personalities. What will become of the next generation of citizens?</p>
<h3>The Astonishment of a Ghost</h3>
<p>— Written by Luo Xiaohua</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>— Hu Keli</p>
<p>(1) Does hot water freeze more easily than cold water?</p>
<p>Answer: No, cold water always freezes more easily than hot water. However, boiled cold water freezes more easily than water from the tap because boiling the water drives out some of the air bubbles it contains.</p>
<p>(2) What are the chances of a pregnant woman having twins?</p>
<p>Answer: Once in every eighty-seven deliveries.</p>
<p>(3) How can flies hang upside down on the ceiling?</p>
<p>Answer: The membranous fleshy pads on the fly's feet secrete a small amount of a sticky liquid, which allows it to adhere to the ceiling.</p>
<p>(4) Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?</p>
<p>Answer: Conventionally speaking, a tomato is a vegetable. But from a horticultural point of view, a tomato should be a fruit because it belongs to the soft-fleshed fruit category.</p>
<p>(5) Why can fear turn a person's face pale?</p>
<p>Answer: Fear stimulates the adrenal glands, causing them to pour out excessive secretions. This excessive secretion constricts the blood vessels on the surface of various parts of the body, so the blood on the surface of the skin is squeezed out, resulting in a sparse state. Extreme anger can also cause the same reaction.</p>
<p>(6) In a race between a human and a horse, who is faster?</p>
<p>Answer: For short distances, the horse is faster; for long distances (referring to consecutive races lasting several days), the human is faster.</p>
<p>A Brief Talk</p>
<h3>A Simple Hope</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>The mother of American President Roosevelt has passed away. The exemplary words and deeds of the mother of this pillar of a democratic country are certainly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>According to Roosevelt's mother's own account, she never thought that her son would become the President of the United States, nor did she dare to harbor such an excessive dream.</p>
<p>However, she wasn't completely without hope for her only child. Like other mothers, she also harbored an important hope for her child. But her hope was simple. She only hoped that when Roosevelt grew up, he would be as fair, straightforward, gentle, and sincere as his father, and become a noble and useful American.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's mother educated her son according to this goal and finally achieved her purpose. This goal, although simple, is reasonable and fundamental.</p>
<p>The ideals and hopes that parents have for their children should be considered from a fundamental point of view, and only by considering them from a fundamental point of view can they be reasonable. Occupation and social status are closely related to a person's opportunities and abilities, and often cannot be achieved by parents' fantasies. Overly high expectations will only lead to shattered dreams and broken hearts.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's mother's hope for her son can serve as a mirror for parents all over the world.</p>

<h3>Airplane Parachute</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>American aviator Goodwin believes that after aircraft parts are damaged in the air, there is no need to crash to the ground. Therefore, he designed an airplane to carry a parachute so that it can land safely when it cannot fly. This method has been successfully tested. The parachute used by the aircraft in the picture is 52 feet in diameter. When the parachute was opened at a height of 500 feet above the ground, the aircraft was able to land safely, and the result was exceptionally satisfactory. The use of parachutes on airplanes may become an important page in the history of aviation.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Disturbances</p>
<p>If Old Man Meng, the shopkeeper, had any humanity left, he would have helped Begonia on his own accord. Every day, no matter what time it was, as long as he walked from the back room to the front shop and looked across the street, he could see Begonia sitting alone on a stool in the doorway, looking dejected. Whenever someone walked by on the street, he would immediately raise his head, open his eyes wide, and eagerly look at the person coming. When he realized that it wasn't Little Dog, or the postman he was hoping for, he would sigh and lower his head again. He was waiting and hoping like this from morning to night, and he didn't even seem to be eating anything.</p>
<p>"Nothing again today, let's see tomorrow!" the postman said with a helpless look. For half a month, he had gotten used to it. When passing by the Wu family's door, without waiting for Begonia to ask, he would often say this on his own accord. As a result, he added to Begonia's depression.</p>
<p>The depression became heavier and heavier, and unknowingly it made the person's spirit worse day by day.</p>
<p>In less than twenty days, Begonia looked much older than before. Although his constantly frowning expression couldn't move the heart of Old Man Meng, who had been a merchant for thirty or forty years, it made his daughter-in-law feel very uneasy.</p>
<p>"Don't worry! Uncle Wu, Meibao will definitely come back soon." One evening, she finally quietly came to the Wu's house, her face flushed, and said to Begonia: "Worrying now is useless. She must be staying somewhere safely, but... but..." (208)</p>

<h3>The Power of the Giant Bell</h3>
<p>— Guo Guo</p>
<p>The giant bell—once again emits its heart-shaking reputation.</p>
<p>Having seen the other great film of Min Hua, "Song of Ancient Bell", one may retain an unforgettable impression regarding the "beauty" of its content, the purity of its consciousness, its abandonment of some old materials, and its emphasis on a spirit of "hard fighting" and "hard defense" among the characters, with each doing their duty and welcoming victory. This is coupled with Mr. Fei Mu's meticulous attitude toward production.</p>
<p>However, I don't intend to elaborate on this further in this article. What I want to talk about is Min Hua, from which this film originated.</p>
<p>"Min Hua is organized by a group of young people," "They deeply believe they can understand their goals 'clearly'." This is a fragment from the preface published by the owner of Min Hua when "Confucius" was released. "Human beings are on the path of 'upward' and 'towards good', and film should be one of the tools for 'leading upward' and 'leading towards good'." This is their interpretation of their goals. And the serious and uncompromising work attitude shown in Min Hua's several profound and powerful products over the years is enough to prove that they are constantly striving towards this goal.</p>
<p>Therefore, standing from the perspective of a pure audience member, for this Min Hua, which has a good tendency and is composed of extremely serious and responsible people like Mr. Fei Mu and a group of young people, there is nothing but a fervent hope that it can expand its organization, increase its speed, and film more works that combine "light" and "heat" for the people in the isolated island, so that it can use its heart-shaking bell sound to dispel the darkness, awaken justice, and fully exert its power of "leading upward" and "leading towards good."</p>
<h3>Gai Jiaotian's Unique Skills</h3>
<p>— Que Wei</p>
<p>The unique skills of Gai Jiaotian recorded in this article are neither Chang Yuchun's whip in the play "Wisely Capturing Beihuzhou" nor Nezha's Universe Ring, but three famous plays uniquely created by Gai Wu.</p>
<p>In "Evil Tiger Village," Huang Daba's single-blade swings with a whooshing sound, and his agile circling when shooting two friends with darts is unparalleled.</p>
<p>Wu Song's Drunkenly Beating Jiang Menshen and Hu Sanniang are best performed with Tan Yongkui and Qi Caifen. Using a dagger to throw at Hu Sanniang, the dagger lands on her neck, deeply embedded in the stage floor, with no room to spare. Furthermore, using a rectangular table to throw at Hu Sanniang, Qi Caifen can kick it away with her slender feet, which is amazing.</p>
<p>In "Three Iron Roosters," when Zhang Jiaxiang is playing towards the Marshal, he wears a fake braid with black coarse silk forming a beard at the end. When Zhang Jiaxiang is leading the horse for the Marshal, he does more than ten somersaults, and finally stands facing the Marshal, slightly pulling his neck. The fake braid can wrap around the neck three times, and the right hand makes a gesture of holding the reins while the left hand uses two or three fingers to hold the beard at the end of the braid. The wonderful thing is that it matches the gongs and drums on the stage perfectly, truly a unique skill.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Shanghai Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) Scene</h3>
<p>— Xue Weihan</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Xiangqi scene is thriving, with chess matches, chess magazines, and chess clubs springing up like mushrooms after rain. The lively situation is unprecedented.</p>
<p>I am very excited about the widespread dissemination of this proper form of entertainment, so I am briefly reporting on what I have seen and heard in the chess world as an introduction:</p>
<p>The Weihan Cup Xiangqi Tournament was held, causing a sensation, and the number of enthusiasts increased sharply. The art of Xiangqi has been valued, considered to cultivate the mind and body, release intelligence, and is worth promoting.</p>
<p>As a result, the popularity of Xiangqi in Shanghai is booming. The "Hua Lian Cup", "Yiyou Cup", and "Jingwu Cup" Xiangqi tournaments were held one after another, with excellent results. The long-planned charity tournament will also open, with a large chessboard suspended in the auditorium of the Hua Lian Tongle Club. Shan Xiafeng, Lian Yi, Customs, Qingyun, Qunying, Yi Lian, Nanhua, Donghua, Nanfeng, Xinguang, Dehua, Zaifeng, Juehuo and other groups are participating in the competition. Ticket sales and recording charity sales are considerable.</p>
<p>Promoting national essence, chess clubs stand in great numbers, such as Xafeng, Cequn, Lewen, and Lianyi. These are all high-class chess playing venues.</p>
<p>Contemporary masters of Xiangqi include Lian Xuezheng, Luo Tianyang, Li Wushang, Bao Zibo, and Pan Minggang. Rising stars include Wu Jianqiu, Xie Wenjun, Jia Antai, Wang Qianzhong, Zhou Xueming, Song Yishan, Cen Minggao, Chen Rongtang, Wu Chuanggui, Tao Qingyuan, Xu Daqing, Huang Jingen, Yu Zeru, Cai Yifei, and Cai Wende, all of whom have outstanding skills and prominent reputations. Gu Junyuan, Tang Shouchun and others are particularly enthusiastic about promoting and spare no effort. Therefore, I have high hopes for the Shanghai Xiangqi scene!</p>
<p>Due to space limitations today, the chess garden will be published tomorrow. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Escaping the Cage with a Lovely Bird</p>
<p>The few words that Yuanyuan said were too intense. She didn't care about taboos and defied Tian Hongyu's wishes, yet she refused to remain silent, and this was because she held another kind of foolish hope in her heart. Before, when she was by the Gusu Terrace, Wu Sangui admired her beauty and sent a messenger from outside the customs to propose marriage with generous gifts of gold. However, at that time, her heart was already devoted to the lyricist, Prince Xi, so she politely declined. When Wu Sangui later sent a confidant to propose again, Yuanyuan had already been forcibly taken away by Tian Hongyu. Now, hearing that Wu Sangui was in Beijing, she couldn't help but feel something in her heart, regretting that she hadn't married Sangui earlier. Wouldn't it be better to serve a dashing and famous general than this senile, declining old man Tian? When Tian Hongyu pressed her for a solution, she came up with this plan, wanting nothing more than to see Wu Sangui's face again. At first, when Tian Hongyu heard Yuanyuan say this, he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed, thinking that Yuanyuan was comparing him to Shi Chong, which felt very ominous. But then he thought to himself that if he wanted to seek peace and security, he had to befriend a general, so Wu Sangui was a brilliant man of the time, and he should associate with him and cater to his preferences. Yuanyuan's words were not unreasonable, just a bit too straightforward. So he said to Yuanyuan, "Alright, you speak so frankly? I'll listen to your plan." Yuanyuan then turned around and said, "Does Your Lordship think my words are correct? This little woman is talking nonsense, and I would like to ask Your Lordship to consider it carefully." Tian Hongyu stroked his beard and said, "I must protect my family's life and property, and have a strong backer, so this is the only way to do it." So, the next day, Tian Hongyu ran to Wu Sangui's place to visit. Originally, Wu Sangui's family home was in Beijing, and his father, Wu _, was currently serving as the director of the Imperial Guard. When Wu Sangui came to Beijing, he lived at home and often had banquets, and his door was very lively. This day, Sangui was resting after a banquet when he suddenly heard that State Father Tian had arrived. He wondered why this person, whom he had no close relationship with, would suddenly come to visit. He immediately invited him in to meet him. (165)</p>
