<p>紐約　「紐約時報」本日稱、英美在馬尼刺舉行之海陸軍事會商、並非欲反應軸心之密切接觸、而係東亞局勢逐漸闡明之自然而合理之結果、英美在亞洲之利益係平行趨向於一共同目標、即東方國家得自由解決其自身之問題是也、（四日合衆電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>第三階段中之上海民食</h3>
<p>上海米價日趨昂貴，米市日見惡劣，綜觀經過，迄今茲而可謂進入第三階段矣。蓋自淪陷區米糧遭刦持，滬上米價步漲，致有國米限價之辦法；及限價寬放仍不能維持，終於被迫廢棄，是為第一階段。此一階段，其時期為自華軍西撒之後至民國二十入年終止，價格則自每市石二十元左右直高至四十餘元。再自放棄國米限價，專評洋米限價，及洋米替代國米居民食中之主耍地位起，荏苒至本年三月杪米糧評價委員會無形消減止，歷時一年光景，旣一再衝破限價，發生暗盤貼價，而致米價寖寖十倍於戰前，有如本年三月份一百十餘元之洋米價，是為第二階段。此一時期中米糧漲風最為猛烈。今則第三階段在發軔之始，來日方長，變化正多，何時方可作一結束，殆待蕩牛戡亂之後歟。</p>
<p>曠觀大勢，盰衡時局，第三階段中之民食，不言而喻之為最嚴重時期，然亦未始非為剝復之交也。蓋自其變化以觀之，（一）則米糧季節性之變遷，愈接近夏季愈烈，此去靑黃不接時期伊邇，在平時尚見其漲，今且更甚。（二）由肥料如豆餅等無不昂貴異常；再加以食用貴則人工亦貴，米之生產費既高，則新米之價亦難平。（三）則寄生之羣一日不去，則淪陷區內產量縱豐，仍不能舒民食之急；何况尚與我爭海外之糧，西貢米之不來，蓋為有七十萬噸正在搬運中也。（四）淪陷區不但無米運滬，反至倚滬上相接濟，於是滬上米商更居為奇貨，米價之漲，振振有辭，囤積之風，不可嚮邇矣。（五）歐戰發生，輪船多被徵調，船隻既缺，水腳節節上漲，果如市上所傳仰光之米一噸運滬，需水腳一百四十先令，幾等於噸米之價，則滬上一石米價之所費，固半為運費也；若戰事延長，運費再漲，不將使米價隨之而俱高耶！（六）為上海糧市，蘄求合理處置之難，難於理論雖好，而事實不相符；用意雖佳，而人情不可通，既不可操切從事，亦非可以敷衍塞責，又非可以偏重一部分之利害，而以為民食行政如是而已；凡此一偏之見，非徒不能造福民食，行且如治絲而益棼。</p>
<p>就上而言，上海民食，行將無辦法已，是亦不然。蓋今日最所困難者不能以中國之糧濟中國之急，於是不得不求諸異域；求諸異域，則市價之高下悉聽人意，而如匯兌上運輸上保險上種種額外之損失，又所不能免，米價遂不易平準，此既為事實所已然，則惟有忍受一時高價米糧之苦痛，以待後來其　耳！至泰越之米，雖為日商所壟斷，然日商所與交易者。非現金，而為日本之貨物，當非泰越之人所受之而心願也。况有為日貨所不能交換者，尚有緬甸之米也。緬甸之米，非現款不易購得，如欲與中國爭購，其競爭之方法，與中國等，同是外匯，此日人所不為，亦無力出此也。緬甸為英屬，中英方謀合作，則以緬甸之糧，濟中國之食，用英商之船，運英屬之糧，縱在軍運頻繁之秋，不難量為調撥，以應中國民食之所求，此應為情理所容許之事。何况上海工部局已有租船委員會之設置，更無虞運輸不盡；即水腳問題亦將隨租船問題之解決，獲得相富之解決。此在法公葦局為保全界內治安，自必採取同樣步驟，運越南之米，以來上海，想不至為日商搬運而竟絕迹，如此則上海米糧貴則有之，尚不至於絕粒也。若以日本南進為慮，將併緬甸之米而亦不能來，此雖非過慮；然世事變化難測，日人之所重者，皆欲出以不戰而服人也。今東非之戰事有結束望，巴爾幹之變化未可知，而美國援助民治國家着着進行；美英遠東海陸軍長官又在密切晤談中，於是松岡方欲作歐陸之遊，而遽傳奉召回國之訉；則南進實現之一問題，更形撲朔迷離，又焉知不慮紙糊木屋之遭殃，舍生張，投熟魏，而點爾以息乎？即不然，今以工部局之船隻，轉運地方民衆所需之食糧，此在無論何一方面，當不至甘心破壞，阻撓上海一隅之運糧，更可證諸運人法國自由區內糧食不受封鎖制限，上海更非法國比，可益信不致橫遭干涉，於以見南洋即使有戰事，在上海之地位，不難於泰越緬三國之中獲得可能之接濟。所難者，上海米糧之分酊問題。此一問題至複雜，按戶口以授糧，從集團以購米，理論非不佳，而集團購米禆益於上海民食者幾何，或未嘗有其實。至按口授糧，事更艱鉅，非倉卒所能舉。即如辦理平糶。事尚易為，尚且人言藉藉，不謂互相勾結，從中侵占；即謂倚勢强買，莫敢誰何；或且分購合販，轉地牟利。眞正貧民，反至連日奔走，不得購米；則欲按口授糧，苟無先之以精密人口調查，繼之以戶口異動登記，若仍委之於米行米號轉售於食戶，則漏巵浩大，弊不勝防。吾則又何從辨其為貧民或為非貧民購買乎？至工部局租船委員會所運之糧，將為商辦之糧，抑為公辦之糧，未聞確切決定，如為公辦之糧，且有振濟貧民之意義於其間，則糧食之如何分配轉賣，稽核防弊，事亦誠難。况仍將兼運商辦之米，以供全市良食所需，則米質固不必限定於何號，而到銷採辦各方面仍應由公家作相當之控制。要知處理整個民食問題，非為消極之振濟，乃為積極之建設。今既困於環境，不能從生產以相調整，而惟就運銷以事補救，則宜乘限價方在無形撒銷，為改正上海民食管理最適宜之時機，一則米價已如是其高，二由存糧又如是其豐，三則定貨復如是之盛，而運輸水腳得有相當解決，則所欠缺者厥惟分配之方式未善耳！夫去其泰甚，匡其不足，而納之於軌物之中，固亦匪襲，其在目前之上海，則舍兩租界當局誰能負此艱鉅哉！</p>

<p>歐戰業談（四三）</p>
<h3>戰時德國的內幕</h3>
<p>比較工廠受損還要厲害的，那就是工人們在空襲時所曠廢的工作時間，和失眠而致工作效率的銳減。德國軍火廠的熟練工人，過去和現在工作時間之長誠令人難以置信。戰事爆發之始，有些工廠的工人每天工作十二小時，每星期工作七天。在這樣情狀之下，工人們的康健，紀律和效率的大有妨害，因而後來工作時間已略為減短。但是最近德國工廠裹的工人，平均每天還須工作十小時，每星期工作六天。</p>
<p>各地辦理工廠的實業家們，每隔一個星期，在週末那一天，總要到柏林去好好的睡一會子，由此可見睡眠問題業已影響到工廠的管理了。一到星期六下午，市內各旅館的房間門口，都掛上「請勿擾亂」的牌子。在雙門臥室之內，只聽得那班疲倦不堪的實業界巨頭們，鼾聲大作。德國的工人們却得不到，這樣休養的淸福。</p>
<p>到我於去年十二月離開柏林為止，柏林市中心區的巴資丹和安哈爾透兩個車站從未被英空軍的炸彈擊中。但是後來有一次，柏林市空並未發現英機，而安哈爾透車站却發生了神秘的爆炸，屋宇起火，燒毀了車站的一部份。柏林有幾處地方受損情形，當然也曾逃過美國新聞記者的眼睛，當柏林遭受轟炸之初，當局常帶我們到報稱被炸最劇烈的地方去視察。後來，英機之來襲，已習以為常，這種視察也就廢止了。除了最高軍事指揮當局與宣傳部方面所發表的公報外，每次柏林的被炸情形均不得有隻字的新聞洩漏。我個人已有好幾次聽見英國轟炸機在頭頂上飛過，並目擊市內的高射砲紛紛放射，可是翌日公報上竟還說，英國飛機並未侵入柏林上空。</p>
<p>為什麼柏林所受英空軍轟炸的損害情形，不甚嚴重呢？這是因為英空軍進襲拍林時，飛機的數量太少，所帶炸彈也不重，不能像德空軍那般的予倫敦以嚴重的損毀。中立國的航空參贊對於空襲柏林的英飛機數目，估計雖各不相同，但據最切近的估計，英機每夜轟炸柏林，最多為三十架，平均則為十五架。若以德境全部來講，每當良夜，英機之飛入德境者，其數自六十架至八十架不等。英軍用終襲德之長距離航程飛機，以威靈吞式及勃侖海式兩種為多。但是有天晚，德方曾在市內擊下一架改造的樂克希特式英機。德方在柏林擊下這第一架美國飛機的消息，在德國方面嚴守秘密，不准美國新聞記者把這種消息傳播出去。</p>
<p>德機用重磅炸　襲擊倫敦，而英機所擲於柏林者則祇限終輕磅炸彈，其理由甚為簡單，這原不過是數學上的關係而已。德空軍襲英所用的轟炸機，一次來回，計程不過二百英里。這樣短程飛航目無須多帶汽油，而所携的炸彈都為五百磅，一千磅，甚至兩千磅。英空軍襲擊柏林一次，其來回必須飛航一千一百英里。他們所帶的總以一百磅重的炸彈為多，惟後來我們也感覺到所擲下的亦有重至二百五十磅的了。英機除了炸彈之外，其鹼裝得最多的，就是汽油。美國所造的飛行堡壘，能把巨型炸彈帶往柏林，從事破壞，然後安全地飛返英國。但是直到現在為止，柏林上空還沒有發現過這種巨型機哩。為了上述的原因，英國的航空人員，無疑的為世界上最勇敢的空軍戰士，每次空襲，在柏林上空找尋目標的時間甚為短促，只有一刻鐘至二十分鐘之久，即須忽忽遄返家鄉。他們一定要用記分秒的按停錶，來計算時間，要是留滯過久，就有汽油告罄，回不得家鄉的危險。有幾架英國飛機因為缺乏汽油而在離開本國海岸數英里之外被迫下降的，這種情形，柏林方面知之基詳，在我離德之後，亦已由英方證實此說之不謬。</p>

<h3>糧食　一日間到米四萬餘　傍晚另有四千二百噸到埠</h3>
<p>洋米紛紛而來、英商夏老臣洋行經理之永貞輪、由仰光直接運米來滬等情、已誌剪報、茲該輪已於昨午抵埠、運來洋米一萬七千一百包、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、又渣華公司新郵船芝楂運加號、昨午到滬、亦由香港裝來洋米二萬四午餘包、停靠浦東藍煙囪碼頭起卸、開平公司經理之芬蘭輪悌爾達Tilda號、直接由西貢運來洋米及苞米四千二百噸、昨日傍晚六時抵滬、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>昨日洋米市初以店舖等舖銷、見大批來源續有抵埠、米市前途、一時似難轉機、遂均觀望鮮進、所以晨開延久未開、浮囤散戶、際此即首先甩脫、大戶客囤亦難擯持、相繼貶售、各價乃續低二元有奇、斯時適市塲公告、今日掃墓節休業一天、店舖作客爲謀添備、不約而同、乘廉突出、頃刻銷塲轉海、市形帶緊、行情漸漸回高、結果較前市僅貶元砠而已、一號西貢百零八九元、二號百零五六元、一號暹邏百零七八元、火絞百零七元、小絞百零五元半、百零五元、中關百零四元半、百零四元、東京砶尖九十七八元、特碎尖八十六元、次八十一二元、英華司小絞回籠原包路貨亦開一百二十六元大至一百二十六元半、期貨一百二十四元半、比前日大起半元、而西貢等市石交易更見活潑、售價統見逐步遞升、較之前市較大半元至一元不等、下午消化依然活絡、形勢續呈挺俏、全日交易亦加至二萬七八千包、原包約三四百噸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、本鄉店胃納意更淡、貨主堅持無效、卒告貶落一二元不等、開常幫特粳斛見百十七八元、高粳百十六元、崑山斛見高粳百十四五元、大市百十一二元、中次百零八九元、青角斛見薄稻百零九元、百零八元、原包百十二元七角、</p>
<p>糯米去路亦僅零星胃口、不過賣方已無累脫之意、所以結果在堅持之下、市面呈勉定之局、開香港特元百零四五元、中關一百元、糯菉特自九十六七元、次至碎九十元、</p>
<h3>存粉一百萬包</h3>
<p>昨日現洋粉市況、逐趨下游、蓋以大批坎粉到滬後、香港轉口粉又絡繹而至、存底已達一百萬包左右、客幫去化亦有自定洋粉、進胃殊屬呆懈、本街舖銷、更有平賣粉供應、需用又減、故市衆賣氣旺盛、市面益呈不支、今市花鳥牌澳粉開盤二十八元六七角、鬆至二十八元四五角、金龍牌坎粉已跌至二十八元關口、比前日又小五六角、華廠平賣粉二十五元、由福新配出五千餘包、其餘仍以洋粉搭配云、</p>
<p>小麥昨日平靜異常、蓋以國產麥存到兩少、市塲早已乏貨供應、故廠方對於原料之採辦、亦不再向市搜索、僅日廠門市偶有收進、市面亦因粉價下游、局勢帶鬆、</p>
<h3>雜糧　苞米終難抬頭</h3>
<p>昨日驃糧油豆餅交易均見減色、行情大都徘徊於小面、原因舖銷終嫌不振、人心難案定、又值該市塲今日循例休市（農曆清明節）、又是六日爲星期、連續有兩天無市、故潛勢平疲乏神、似苞米尤受天時影響、賣氣充溢。市價下瀉、在昔如何之漲、至今有如此之跌、早在一般預料之中、總之醬裏活、醬裏死、歷歷不爽、昨日西項苞米內棧貨、其最低價已開至三十元零六角、外棧爲三十元、四月份交爲六十三元五角、三月下至四月上亦爲三元半、荷蘭白苞米爲三十二元、黃苞米爲三十三元、現貨英華司爲三十三元二角、四月份交六十二元、三月下至四月上交六十二元五角、共計成交現貨十車、期貨十二三車、今日有豆餅二千二百四十塊運香港、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙市勢　重臻穩定</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌仍平、英美匯暗市、情況殊靜、幾無變化、而投機商續來拋空五月期美匯四五十萬地獄、但匯豐等外行吃胃尚有、故結果收盤較隔昨英金尚軋於〇一五六二五、爲三辦士二三四三七五、美匯則無軒輊、仍爲五元三一二五、期貨趨勢相仿、</p>
<p>投機仍有塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條均平、紐約銀價及倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英美名匯等俱無上落、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行開現貨賣價、英金三辦士二三四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、較隔昨英緊〇一五六二五、美則告平、開後匯豐稍扒、進同行本月份美匯五元三一二五、斯時若向之結進本月與五月美匯、則須五元二八一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦平、此後投機商前來拋塞五月期貨美匯四十萬元光景、價爲五元三一二五、均由某美行等吸入、時聞華行亦有對做、而市況缺乏變動、午刻五月份美滙五元三一二五、或可結得、收盤英金現期均告三辦士二三四三七五、美匯現貨與本月俱爲五元三一二五、五月份則告五元二八一二五、</p>
<p>芟緊美則軋平</p>
<p>後市投機商結有少數塞出、計成交過四月份美匯五元三一二五、入後鮮聞做開、迄收盤英金仍三辦士二三四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、五月份英金三辦士二一八七五、美滙五元二八一二五、結果比上日現期英均微緊〇一五六二五、美則榮辱不分、</p>
<p>香港匯市平定</p>
<p>香港四日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、申滙現貨獨升五角、爲四百六十三元、（昨收爲四百六十二元半）、餘無榮辱、十一時三十分告平、申滙現貨回降五角、仍爲四百六十二元半、餘無變動、</p>
<p>天津英美俱縮</p>
<p>天津四日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤告軟、倫敦電匯緊〇三一二五、爲三便士三一二五、紐約電匯縮〇六二五、爲五元四三七五、申匯升五角、爲九十六元二角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤昂三角八分、爲六十三元三角七分</p>
<h3>見高便來出籠　金市乏勁</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤漲落互見、起伏不大、初乃英匯稍緊、人心尚佳、一度曾漲至六千五百五十五元、旋因浮鑫羣起出籠、即告跌至六千五百二十二元、入後市勢更平、新豐永同康永等雖續來了結、但合盛恒記補空亦切、且立泰多頭代某戶加碼、故結果收盤尚有六千五百三十八元、較上軋漲六元、全天交易約一萬七八千兩、現金先堅後疲、初由新天寶吸入天元九十兩、及成記十兩、價加二百元、同時成記又賣予鳳祥和記十兩、價仍加二百元、午後實貨需要缺少、竟比上價做小三十元、曾聞某銀樓吐予德孚五十兩、價加一百七十元、</p>
<p>全日微漲六元</p>
<p>晨初每條（十兩）開市、人心尚好、照掛牌（即開盤）有人買進、遂抬起十八元、爲六千五百五十元、俄頃益大成記吐塞、小至六千五百三十八元、但斯時德大祥和及新豐永天元等頻吸不已、故復又漲達六千五百五十五元、而此後新豐永止進返賣、接跡大豐義豐德孚同康永德成等力塞、且匯市期貨微硬、買戶束手、遂步跌至六千五百二十二元、午刻成記恒記及散戶等補空、市勢稍轉、曾回至六千五百三十二元、午後開市爲六千五百三十六元、繼因益大吐出步小數元、但不久合盛力吸補空、（代新豐洋行）、加之德大及散戶亦進、遂反高達六千五百四十五元、然其時祥和多頭出籠、而新豐永亦跟之多頭了結、雖立泰代某戶多頭加碼狂吸、計有一千二三百兩、然仍求不敵供、終被撳至六千五百廿五元、入後鑫源扒進不少、又抬至六千五百四十元、收盤爲六千五百三十八元、結果比上日軋漲六元、全天三十三元上落、現金號之本牌金及現標金等、均無行無市、</p>
<p>飾金原價不動</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出、終日未動、大同行與新同行仍均懸六百九十元、收進減低四十元光景、</p>
<h3>金幣各漲一元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價穩中帶堅、且現金市勢甚俏、故英美金鎊各漲一地獄、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票初做十八元五角半、繼而步高至五角九分、但旋又下落至五角一分、午後又高至十八元五角六分、比上日軋升二分、香港票需要尚殷、市價微漲、日金票及朝鮮票均趨低落、前者退爲一元九角七分、後者降至一元六角一分、</p>
<h3>證券　內債前途明朗</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況反動漸起、午前堅定、午後忽傳美國新借款又有二萬五千萬元成功之希望、此在寇利特使回國、經濟援華實現之第一聲、事實確有可能、但尚未實現、因此市塲萎靡不振之空氣、頓覺爲之一振、趨勢前途、漸漸明朗而挺秀、昨日上午、聯和協大同康信孚恒孚順昌均有買進、無如裕興出戊種獨多、餘如恒康仁昌仁豐永孚等均有多頭了結、故午收市價參差不一、午後初開仍屬平平、入後消忽好、聯益進胃極強、入甲種約三四十萬、協興元入乙丙兩種、約三十萬、餘如德昌公茂信孚和豐通記均有買進、仁豐仁昌兩家約賣出四十萬、永昌鴻大潤昨均有賣出、聯合進出均極熱鬧、市價即在大進大出中冉冉上騰、結果繼續上漲二角至六角半、成交總數共計約二百八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　七六·二〇　七五·四〇　七六·二〇　漲〇·六五</p>

<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價爲九十四元正、倫敦三日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均告平滯、行情概無上落、</p>
<h3>紗花　要負擔三日風險　紗市清淡</h3>
<p>紗市依然無甚榮辱可分、日趨殊覺萎靡不振、此因實際地位絕鮮進展、港幫納胃殊狹、至於其他幫口、皆受封鎖影響、生意日蹙、所以買戶興趣澹泊、但原棉情形尚昂、就此拋賣亦不十分相宜也、於是大家擯持勿動、須俟瞄頭一來、再當下手、或進或出、則決定方針矣、惟有一部份賣出雙馬、掉進天女地球、所以近來雜牌紗堅昂之由來也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千三百九十四元、低價爲一千三百八十八元、午後因明日清明節、市塲停市、有三日之風險、大都不願舉動、未曾成交、喊價一千三百九十三四元之譜、今日有棉紗一千八百五十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬居開市象極其和平、首盤價爲一千三百九十二三元、塲上成交未旺、少頃、微升至一千三百九十四元、然買戶均渙散乏勁、在此盤週旋悠久、繼聞外匯亦屬寗靜、一般投機的人們、都喊「無做頭」、心意乏味、市況帶鬆、跌至一千二百八十八元、迨至收盤時、并二十支天女雙地球有人收進幾包、售價較昂、回上一步、至一千三百九十一元收盤、查半日間成交統計四千五百包、茲將各幫口買去之客量分別如左、</p>
<p>香寗　四〇　內地　一二〇</p>
<p>寗波　一〇　同行　四、三三〇</p>
<p>統計　四、五〇〇</p>
<h3>棉紗賣不起價　改買棉花一時稱盛　印棉市塲轉以東非獲勝而跌　上海市塲長絲毛美特林更俏</h3>
<p>現棉情況、轉趨活潑、華廠申新裕新採辦較爲起色、惟永安廠辦意未旺、邇以美棉步步上升、致人心良好、同行中之皮球交易、異常熱鬧、大衆對於棉花者日見增加、大衆意見、謂棉花存底既薄、而外棉情勢看昂、至於棉紗囤積既厚、而出路窮蹙、所以將紗之籌碼移轉在棉花做輸羸矣、惜乎廠方因紗價賣不起、盈利薄弱、吸收興緻、較爲退步、因之上升力量尚屬迂緩也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、晨初因有同業及華盛頓買進而堅強挺進、唯續後又因一部分獲利了結而稍跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日連漲十至十六磅因不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市先因棉商套賣進口之蘇丹棉埃及棉而跌、旋因買方支持平復、但最　再因非洲戰事、英國獲勝、將有大量埃及蘇丹等非州棉進口而跌、昨日收盤價格各跌一至三羅比不等、又預測今日開盤、略漲一羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因上月底有荷輪載來巴西棉四千餘包、故連日廠方與同業競購、頗爲熱烈、市況亦突飛猛進、尤以細絨原料之長絲毛美特林晚緊俏、預料因各方局勢有利、故將有更活躍之棉市也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　大宗布疋運港</h3>
<p>廠布昨市續堅、同業賣買及本街實需仍見活動、惟各幫祗粵港幫一路可通、採辦亦最踴躍、今日有疋頭二千一百六十件運往香港、售盤白貨大鵬細布經華豐等廠繼續搜羅、獨漲五角、餘檔細布斜紋均較遜色、開價平平、怡和各檔粗布手貨漲二角半至五角、惟仍較行盤爲廉、深色細紗貨綫呢嗶嘰漲三五角、本街成交各布五百餘件、粵港幫辦三羊嗶嘰華豐藍布大新色斜等貨三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布市勢平穩、白貨因實銷清淡、稍漲即挫、無甚榮辱、龍頭細布最高盤售四十九元七角五分、低盤四十九元五角、收市時現出成交四十九元六角、四君子嗶嘰續漲五厘、爲一元四角五分、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價續鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市因連日盛漲之後、囤胃漸足、頗有人傾向吐出、價乃續鬆、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧八十七元九角至五角、降八角、期貨四月十日打單初尚堅穩、爲八十九元至八十八元半、旋鬆至八十八元二角、八十七元八角、六角、降元許、四月二十日打單、開盤爲九十元、後爲八十九元五角、八十九元、八十八元六角、降九角、荷赤六十八元半、小三角、太古車白B嘜八十九元六角、五角、無軒輊、DY嘜八十四元、小四角、HX嘜八十三元二角、小二角、昨由荷蘭來糖二萬四千包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭竹枝行盤見升</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝因到存漸稀、市勢略見轉低、號盤已開升五元、行盤亦隨之見增、惟烏葉枝收去化仍疲、存數雖稀、依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>海味　蝦米到銷兩稀</h3>
<p>蝦米邇來到貨稀少、但各方去化亦屬清淡、故市勢極爲平定、惟朝邊尾較昂、現市售六百五十元、田邊尾四百三十元、元東尾四百五十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　同得利白煤　昇騰益速</h3>
<p>同得利白煤、市氣蓬勃、貨盤繼續漲高、因本客需求續旺、而同業手貨、漸形枯竭、行家又關住不出、暗盤昇騰益速、昨同得利一二號塊已喊　三百八十元、老單出貨、棧租照除、本街門莊店、亦水漲船高一致抬上、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵街銷甚活</h3>
<p>二百磅新老鋼廠會司鐵、現因市上流通貨不多、兼之海外來源斷檔、故本街製罐廠·玩具廠·印刷廠·餅乾廠以及同業拆貨等市面殊不岑寂、逐日成交之數、常在百箱出外、故而執貨者心思挺蓬、行情明漲暗緊、較前加起三四十地獄不等、刻每箱售四百元左右、其次狹條鐵·青鉛雙連板及青鉛會司鐵等漲風京堪稱可驚、又前市之平白鐵市價、因囤戶幫之出籠、曾減售至十五六元一張、惟昨市忽因客邦及廠銷稍動、喊價又漲、須二十一二元一張、</p>

<h3>變更工董名額　必經過合法手續　大會議後卽通知領團　再行呈報各國政府核准</h3>
<p>官方人士昨（四日）晨語西報記者、關於提議中之工部局董事名額更變、謀取對華締的各國輿中國政府核准時、或將有所困難、但此終工部局毫無影響、聞工董名額之更變、將謀取領事團之整個核准、而非各個領事之核准、查領事團十二國領事、除日本外、皆承認重慶政府為中國之合法政府也、</p>
<p>最後決定　為時尙早</p>
<p>官方人士又證實英美日三國總領事現正草擬更變工董名額之建議、將以決議案方式於四月十七日納稅人特別大會中提出、據稱、公共租界納稅人若核准此項更變、則將通知領事團領袖領事、然後呈報對華締的各國之高級代表與重慶中政府、記者問工董名額更變、可否邀准、官方人士答稱、今尚過早、或有意外發展、故不能斷言、</p>
<p>額外董事　人選問題</p>
<p>同時本市各界仍以本年工董競選結果為討論主題、工部局除華英美日董外、既有添增其他國籍董事之可能、旅滬人數較少之數國僑民團體、乃巳擇定理想中之額外董事候選人、但除美僑已於二月間舉薦兩候選人外、他國僑民、尚术確切推定候選人、</p>
<p>俄僑協會　從事竸選</p>
<p>本市俄僑協會、昨日下午曾召開緊急會議、討論將向領事團提出一建議、要求在工部局中、增加俄籍董事一名、昨晨各俄文報對此一建議、咸以巨大之篇幅記載、鼓吹能達成其目的、彼等所持之理由、在滬俄僑人數甚多、所擁有之財產與利益、亦日見增加、故要求在工部局中、應擭董事一席或二席、俄僑方面承認白俄在滬並無領事、故競選時、不無困難、惟吾認俄僑大部份係寄寓法租界之說、並稱、俄僑在公共租界之利益、較其他目下在工部局無董事席之僑民為多、又據俄僑協會主席伊凡諾夫語記者、本埠俄僑、現正推舉候選人一名、參加工部局「其他國籍」董事之競選、</p>
<h3>全市存米　一百六十萬包</h3>

<p>冒充探員　敲詐米號</p>

<h3>法租界當局　切盼居民減電　已特組電流限制委員會　發電柴油短絀公司困難</h3>
<p>關於法租界內節减電流三項根本原則已誌昨報、茲悉法租界當局巳特組電流限制委員會其人選如次、</p>
<p>（主席）法國領事杜伐</p>
<p>（委員）公董局會辦白衣、公董局總工程師蒲貢、警務處副總監薩理、法商水電公司經埋法佛萊·許樂·趙志游·拉班兒·桑且、</p>
<p>該會於最近在公董局開會、當由水電公司經理法佛萊報告公司所遇困難情形、謂公司每月需柴油二千一百噸、而火油公司僅允應於三月及四月每月供給一千五百噸、而以後之供給數量、則不予保證矣、水電公司現存油五千二百噸、僅敷三月之需、故不得不擬定切實減電計劃、减電辦法、將分別緩急施行之、界內用電最多者、厥為各工廠、但工業影響社會問題頗大、故其所用軍量、在可能範圍內、將盡力維護、至於電熱路招霓紅燈等所耗電流、則務須節省、而居戶更應體諒公司苦哀、自動减其所用電量、以渡難關、聞電流限制委員會、定於下星期四再行召開會議、</p>
<p>按目下法租界內每月所耗電量如左、</p>
<p>住戶　2．656．000　K．W．H．</p>
<p>工廠　3．088．600　K．W．H．</p>
<p>電熱　385．000　K．W．H．</p>
<p>民族掃墓節</p>
<h3>沉痛默祭　追念衛國英靈</h3>
<p>今日為民族掃墓節（即廢歷淸明節）、前經政府明令決定、在此日期祭奠祖先及烈士、本市各界人士、均於堅毅肅穆空氣中、準備分赴租界內各公墓丙舍、拜祭死亡家屬外、並一致揷柳掛桃、招忠貞衛國之英靈、原擬赴廟行無名英雄墓、江灣孟州烈士墓祭奠、以環境特殊、故仍循例中止、僅作沉痛默祭抗建衛國之陣亡將士、誓繼承先烈未竟之遺志、終國民崗位上齊一步伐、為國家民族爭取最後勝利、</p>
<p>殺牛公司宰豬作　工潮突發　工人工會收取豬毛　公會理事反對被毆</p>
<p>本市法租界段牛公司宰作業共有六十餘家、內分江陰·蘇州·本地三幫、共雇宰猪工人二百餘名、近因該業同業公會理事陳金海反對該業工人工會收取猪毛三天、充作兩會之經費、（前該猪毛係屬於勞資雙方所有）致遭工方不滿、前日（三日）下午八時三刻、陳由家至公司辦公、行抵敏體尼蔭路公司門口時、突遭工人廿餘人毆傷甚重、結果由崗捕到來、將羅事之工人兩名拘解捕房、一面由捕召救護車送廣慈醫院醫治、捕房並於昨日起訴、詎昨日（四日）下午、該業工人突然罷工、致殺牛公司工作、現已全部停頓、惟工方突然宣告罷工、事前事後、均未說明理由、僅悉工方此次罷工目的、即為要求抽房釋放被捕之兩工人、</p>
<p>西服工潮　調解結果</p>
<p>霞飛路·湖北路·四川路·等處百數十家西服店成衣工人、鍳於邇來本市米價已超出一百元以外、（按該業於去年十月二十八日所訂之勞資協的所規定，以秈米（二號）超出一百元、則另繼工資、）要求資方改善待遇、雙方意見懸殊於二十八日起、實行罷工、茲悉、該項工潮、前晚經公共租界工部局政治部調解結果、除霞飛路因資方米出席、故仍未有解決、其餘湖北路·四川路等處、勞資均巳同意簽訂協定、辦法如下、（一）增加工資如（甲）現有工資四元或四元以內者、增加四成、（乙）現有工資八元或八元以內者、增加三成四、（丙）現有工資八元以上者、則一律增加三成、（丁）長工裁剪、根據現有工資增加三成二、（二）以上係長襖之工資、其他夏衣·大衣·背褲·出件工頭等工資、一律按照長襖之增加成數增加之、例如某店長襖增加三成、則其餘一切工資亦增加三成、（三）本協定為米價（二號秈米）漲至一百五十元時、則照新碼子再增加二成、以後每增加米價五十元、則再照新碼子增加二成、例如現在工資六元者、加二元〇四分、如米價超出一百五十元時、則再增加一元六角〇八厘、共計九元六角四分八厘、依此類推、</p>
<p>郵工要求　兩項辦法</p>
<p>本埠郵政局職員、因鑒於物價高漲、會二度向乍配林請求加薪、局方乃於日前復電總局示、務請於三日內覆示辦法、據稱此次郵局職員要求加薪、擬有二項辦法、第一、郵務工會方面要求、每人加薪百元、而郵務職工會、則請求月薪在百元以下者、增加百分之二百五十、月薪一百至二百元者、加百分之二百、二百元以上者、加百分之一百五十、</p>
<p>一部秤店　已經復工</p>
<p>衡器業（即秤店）總數共有四十餘家、職員以薪水微薄、要求店主增加薪水六成、未為店主容納、全體罷工、探悉資方己有三十餘家、接受職員請求、酌量加薪、尚有十餘家、因未容納要求、故現　停業中、</p>
<p>皮鞋工人　罷工滋擾</p>
<p>皮鞋業於本月一日起、又以成本飛漲、增加售價後、該業勞方、鑒終本年一月問所增加津貼二成與米貼二成、尚不敷維持生活、乃於本月一日向資方要求再予增加津貼、未獲要領、一部份鞋店工人、即於二日起、開始罷工、昨日上午十時左右、有罷工工人三十名、前往新閘區照常工作之鞋店、要求工人參予罷工、捕房聞訊後、恐有礙治安、將罷工工人十三名、予以拘押、</p>

<h3>稅制不平等當局建議補救　小組委員會擬具報告書　將交納稅外人年會討論</h3>
<p>工部局前　研究稅制之不平等情形起見、曾設置一小組委員會、負責研究、並建議如何補救方法、委員人選原爲樊克令·鍾思·孫瑞璜·梅翰·暨岡本五人、繼復加聘地產業公會代表伊善靈頓一人爲委員、茲已討論竣事、並提呈報告書兩份、一份係經委員五人同意者、另一份則爲伊氏單獨提出者、以上兩報告書、均經工部局董事會昨日（四日（特別會議提出討論、結果決定將前者移付本屆納稅外人年會討論、其內容如下、</p>
<p>房捐之不平等情形　查公共租界以及所調界外馬路區域內之業產租用人所付房捐、在過去及現在、大多以所付租金之實數爲依據、另一方面、業產自用人所付房捐、則以工部局作價爲根據、此種作價、在論理上係參照租戶對於同樣業產所付之租金而確定、在房租價值有一變動之時、遲早必須調整自用業產之佔價、使與房租價值之變動情形相吻合、</p>
<p>工部局之現行稅制、對於各納稅人、向稱相當公允、倘本埠情形一如往昔、則此種稅制、當無缺憾可言、第以自滬戰以還、情勢反常、以致過稱滿意之稅制、發生不平等情形、應即設法補救、此種不平等情形、可約略分折爲（一）、業產租用人間之不平等、（二）業產租用人與業產自用人兩者間之不平等、（三）由於捐稅之混合計算辦法而發生之不平等、</p>
<p>受保障與不受保障　關於第一點、如欲切實研究業產租用人間之不平等情形、應先將租戶分爲兩類、即受保障之租戶與不受保障之生戶、所謂受保障之租戶者、即該租戶受中國民法之保障、非經法院之裁定、不得動遷或加租、此外、租戶因訂有長期租賃契約者、亦受同樣保障、中國民法之規定、按照中國法院之解釋、凡訂有按月計算之租賃契約或未訂契約者、業主除非欲將房屋收回自用或拆卸翻造。不得飭其遷移、且非經法院裁定、不得向其加租、因此、自一九三七年以來、業主欲得加租之允許者、非常困難、即經核准加租者、爲數亦屬有限、且所加之數、大半限於二成或不滿二成、據正確之估計、受保障之租戶、約占上海租戶全數百分之八十、至於一般不受保障之租戶、均屬不受中國法管理、而在戰前並未訂有長期租賃契約者、</p>
<p>租戶因享受保障之利益、以致所付租金、或仍與虞前相彷、或所加之數、至二成爲止、但在另一方面、一般不受保障之租戶、祗得聽任業主之意旨、結果其所付房捐、係以頻頻增加之租金爲依據、但受保障之租戶所付之房捐、仍根據戰前之租金、或有限之增加爲依歸、</p>
<p>戰前戰後市面不同　查中國民法、雖非新近頒布者、但在一九三七年戰前期間、征稅制度、已稍稍感覺不平等矣、其理由爲出租業產在戰前有公開之市面、且租金有正常與自然之水準、例如一九三七年春間、倘一業主意圖加租、所加之數、經租戶認爲並不合理、則該租戶可遷至另一房屋、其時受保障之租戶、其情形不如今日爲佳、蓋一九三四至三五年間、房租趨跌、至一九三七年春間、猶未完全恢復一九三三年之水準、迨滬戰發生以後、上海及其四郊遭戰禍之糜爛、範圍頗廣、以致租界及其所轄區域、發生擁擠情形、於是是局勢改觀、彼不受保障之租戶、因加租而欲另覓佳所、頗感棘手、業產之公開市面、消於無形、而以上兩類租戶所付之租金、其數額之懸殊、愈趨愈烈、結果造成付捐之不平等情形、</p>
<p>重新估價尚未告成　租金之或漲或跌、在工部局現行稅制之下、以上兩類租戶所付房捐、自必發生不平等情形、工部局有鑒於斯、爰於上年年初、成立一重估價委員會、從事於自用業物之再估價、對於自用工商業房屋、如一九三七年六月卅日之估價予以估定、再照加二成、以定期現行價值、而備上捐之用、所加之一成、認爲係自一九三七年以來租金之平均增加額、同時捐務處亦依據上項標準、重估自用住宅房屋之價值、</p>
<p>該委員會雖經努力加緊工作、但在上年年底以前、未克將所有自用房屋重估剖腹產、自本年一月份起、各該已經重估之房屋、則按其重新估計之價值、征收房捐、所有未經重估之房屋、則聽候重估、此舉使租用房屋與已經重估之自用房屋間之不平等情形、當可減輕、但另一方面、則在經重估價與未經重估價之自用房屋之間、發生不平等情形、該委員會之估價工作、在本年秋季以膠、恐未能全部造成、則上述後者之不平等情形、在本年秋季以前、恐未能全部消除、（未完）</p>
<h3>歡樂的兒童節</h3>
<p>昨日爲兒童節，全市兒童，莫不歡欣鼓舞，慶祝佳節，學校敎員與學生家長，均率領小朋友至公園游覽，中德醫院並舉行兒童健康比賽，盛況空前。（上圖）中德醫院兒童表演疊羅漢。（王爵榮攝）（下圖）潛艇界顧家宅公園兒童運動會之一瞥，一羣天眞活潑之兒童，正作蹺蹺板之遊戲。（康祖藝攝）</p>
<h3>兒童節游園</h3>
<p>— 蔚</p>
<p>兒童節是兒童解放的日子，該讓兒童們盡情地玩樂，大孩子上午由學校裏集團伴往杜美戲院看電影，下午我決定伴他們往公園裏去遊玩。我覺得孩童們由校裏老師領導著去公園遊玩，是多麽愚笨呀！照顧孩子們是敎師們委實太感麻煩，而孩子們因爲要受團體的約束，反不能隨心所欲地暢玩。當我看到幾個失羣的孩子，因不見了他的同伴與老師那種徬徨啼哭的情形，他的老師也將因不見了一個孩子而多麽苦痛呀！</p>
<p>法國公園因爲離家很近，孩子們平素自己也會去玩了，便決定去到較遠的公園，亦可以使他們感覺到像是旅行的樂趣。</p>
<p>飯後一點半鐘出發，等過四輛公共汽車，才擠上了第五輛車，直到愛多亞路外漢下車，大孩子問我屹立在愛多亞路口的銅像是什麽。我告訴他這是第一次歐戰的和平紀念塔，這個生翅膀的女身，叫做和平神，但是這個和平之神並沒有嚇退那些瘋狂的侵略者，現在全世界又都在打仗了呀！</p>
<p>沿著黃浦，不知不覺走到了外灘公園，小的一個孩子，看到浦江裏大小船隻很感興趣，他最愛一隻破浪飛駛的白色小汽船，也許他以爲就是面盆裏盛滿了水開著玩的玩具汽船呢。</p>
<p>走進了外灘公園，遊人並不很多，草地都顯著憔悴枯黃的顏色，沿蘇州河口的一片較大的草地而且是禁止踐踏的，除了沿馬路這邊有些綠樹和花草之外，半個園子是荒涼而無生趣。我們在沿浦的長椅上坐了一會，海關的老鐘正敲二下，新鐘點該是三時了，便決意出來再往兆豐花園去。</p>
<p>在南京路外灘匯中飯店門前，登上一路公共汽車的上層最前一排，由極東把我們送到極西的兆豐花園。園門前利國利民，遊人，小販，　三奏著喧囂的都會之曲。</p>
<p>走進門，滿園都是一羣羣一團團的人，孩子們如出籠的小鳥，爭著向草地上飛奔而去。我們便坐在草地上把帶來的點心吃了，便隨興往各處蹓躂</p>
<p>成羣的孩子，由他們的先生領著，在草地上玩著各種遊戲，或者在矮樹下奔路追逐，橡皮球像流星在空中上落，河中飄著小帆，池塘邊在捉小魚和蝌蚪。滿園是孩子們的世界。</p>
<p>我們向東面走著，跨過池塘上的小橋，走入土坵上的樹木間。有時奔跑，有時慢步，穿過了廣大平坦的綠草，深入西北角上樹林中，轉彎曲折，到了一處潢種花草的所在。有各種顏色的花，淡褐色的楓葉，如雪海的梨花，滿目都是鮮豔的色彩。好像我們變了「綠野仙蹤」裏的四個角兒，那末九歲的明兒，就讓她充作桃樂賽吧，六歲的霖兒，他很勇敢但還不能思想，那末就稱他是稻草人吧，十四歲的大孩子鍾兒性情比較溫和，但記心似乎不好，那末就由他權充機器人吧，然而我該來扮這匹柔順的獅子了。我們並不要去找翡翠宮裏的老博士。</p>
<p>我們走得相當疲乏，便在樹蔭下憩息，然後經過西邊的那座高高的種滿花的土坵，到了那座黃牆的祖廟，見後門口畫著龍的牆壁邊，有兩個妖艷的女子，給一個男子拍照，做出妖異的舉動，我不忍再看一眼，直穿到門前，在樹下厚厚的軟軟的草地上，吁了一口濁氣，便走出了園門。</p>
<h3>防止汽車喇叭聲　下月將舉行宣傳週　深夜擾人清夢甚爲可厭　警務處決採取調整方法</h3>
<p>本市汽車甚夥、往來街頭、其喇叭聲不絕於耳、白晝尚不覺其煩、入夜則其聲鳴鳴、擾人清夢、尤其在夏季、市民多啟窗而臥、驟聞喇叭聲、驚醒酣眠、頗以爲苦、</p>
<p>防喇叭聲擾人運動　工部局警務處有鑒於斯、將於五月份復興法租界警務處合作、依照頗收成效之「安全第一」運動方針、推行防喇叭聲擾人之運動、歷時一週、若獲期望中之結果、則夜眠可不爲喇叭聲所擾矣、</p>

<p>實地表演機械器具　往年警務當局、曾對汽車於不必要時亦按喇叭事、有所告誡、無甚效果、故希望於此次運動中實地表演用機械器具、使喇叭聲音減至最低限度、聞警務處爲推廣減聲器具之使用起見、將免費爲私人汽車與出租汽車調整喇叭聲浪、警務處交通塗某警官昨曾向記者表演用此器具、使喇叭聲減低之方法、</p>

<h3>謹防第五縱隊</h3>
<p>— 伍俗</p>
<p>近來有個風行一時的新名詞，叫做『第五縱隊』。自從德國在歐陸大獲勝利以後，『第五縱隊』更是名震一時，尤其是在美車，報章雜誌所登載的，總脫不了第五縱隊的故事。第五總隊幾乎弄得草木皆兵了。</p>
<p>其實第五縱隊這東西，不僅國際間有，也不是在軍事上政治上才有；而是在你的身上，在我的身上，在他的身上，隨時隨地都可以有的。</p>
<p>甚麽是你的第五縱隊呢？你的惡習慣就是你的第一縱隊。今天偷懶，少做幾分鐘的工作；今天放肆，多發幾次脾氣，多想幾次壞念頭，在惡環境中多逗留一會兒，多做一件使良心不安的事，初看起來似乎是沒有甚麽關係的，可是，你無形中已經在自己的性格上佈置　第五縱隊了。</p>
<p>你如果這樣敷衍下去，不去加以注意與糾正，有一天，你的第五縱隊將在你的身上加緊進行破壞工作，到那時候，你將失業，你將得病，你將陷於不能自救的境地；至那時候，你後悔也來不及了。</p>
<p>所以，你得謹防第五縱隊！</p>

<h3>我的野孩子</h3>
<p>— 野孩子的朋友</p>
<p>野孩子，有些討厭相！破碎的衣服，骯髒的手臉，粗暴的舉動，鄙俗的語言；疥瘡，癩痢，蟲子佈滿了全身。高貴人家的孩子快離遠些，接近了可不得了，非但要過著粗野的習氣，而且要傳染惡性的疾病。於是做父母的相率警告自己的兒女不要接近小癟三，不要和野孩子一塊兒玩耍。這是對的。可是單將自己的孩子關起來，不和野孩子接觸，就能保險野孩子的野氣不會影響到家孩子的身上嗎？請眼光放遠些瞧：現在的歹人主濁從前的野孩子，現在能保護自己兒女的父母就是從前的家孩子；歹人多了，日子好過嗎？國家像樣嗎？這樣看來，單把自己的孩子和野孩子隔絕是不夠的，除非把野孩子都變成了家孩子才可以放心。野孩子是否可以也變爲家孩子？這要看社會大衆的決心如何。</p>
<p>我和一部份的野孩子做了兩年的朋友，覺得他們的本性並不十分可厭，環境壓迫他們做出種種不好的行爲，日子多了，積習難反，又似乎是他們的生性下賤。我將他們譬爲一幅白布濺滿了污穢，等乾久了才去洗滌，一時洗不乾凈，人家誤以爲無法洗凈，由空去罷。然而若能經過塗學的漂洗，任你什麽顏色都可以漂得雪白。野孩子肯經過適當的敎育，任你多麽討厭，也可以變得可愛。我雖然不能像一加一是二那樣確切的保證，至少丙年來經騐告訴我如此。</p>
<p>記得幾年前在某報看到某將軍的軼事，那將軍有一次向人家演說，劈頭一句就是：『中國有我，決不會亡。』聽衆大爲驚奇，怎麼他這樣誇大，難道他一個人就能挽救中國嗎？接著那將軍說道：『每一個人都有一個我，全中國四萬萬人民就有四萬萬個我，集四萬萬個我難道還不中用嗎？』掌聲雷也似的從聽衆中轟出。</p>
<p>我不敢模仿那將軍的口吻，而且應用在談談野孩子的問題上面，不免要被譏爲喻之失當。可是每一個成人若能把無人顧問的野孩子認做『我的孩子』，用對『我的孩子』的態度去待野孩子，去救野孩子，去改造野孩子，非但野孩子得以出水火而登袵席，家孩子將來也可以避免被侵襲的危機。愛護自己兒女的賢明家長請三思之。</p>
<p>上海兒童保育會正在進行營救野孩子的工作。經保育院敎養的流浪孩子已改換頭面跳出了地獄，踏進人間。他們愛讀書，不肯做工，懂禮貌，有精神。凡是訪問過他們的仕女，都點頭稱許，覺得他們不是廢物，而是有前途的孩子，但是會中人力財力微薄，不能普渡他們，因此發起了一個徵求『苦兒之友』的運動。希望幸福的同胞們踴躍參加，藉大衆的愛心，作爲他們的慈航。（上海兒童保育會的辦公處是在圓明園路一六九號四樓四一九號。）</p>

<h3>父親是我們的朋友</h3>
<p>— 莫梓</p>
<p>我的父親，五十多歲的年齡，兩鬢已經花白，卻有著一顆年青的心。</p>
<p>也像許多人無法去掉環境給予他們的約束一樣，我的父親出身在一個頑固的封建的大家庭裏面，從此養成拘謹和謙讓的性格。五十多年來，看過許多世變，經歷許多滄桑，卻仍有著一顆沒有和世俗同流合污的良心，用自己的勞力換取生活資料。我的父親雖有時同世俗不合，但並不對他們表示厭惡的態度。他仍舊滿足於自己的大地，樂觀地過著自己的生活。</p>
<p>一般人都用　嚴代表父親對待子女的態度，但這兩個字於我們卻並不適合。尤其是近幾年來，我和弟弟都漸漸長大，知道得也漸漸多了。我們常常任意的談笑，議論世事，批評人物。高興的時候，父親往往說：</p>
<p>『我們倒不像是父子了，我們是朋友，哈哈我們是朋友。』</p>
<p>父親讀過許多古書古經，但是他也願意接受新知。最近他曾看過不少爲時代青年所信仰，而常爲上一代或思想頑固的人所詬病的書，他看了卻擊節讚賞。有許多新穎的名詞，他發現了便來問我們，我們知道的便詳細的解釋，他聽了很快慰，常常說：</p>
<p>『現在你們懂得比我多了。從前青跟老年人走，現在老年卻要跟青年人走了。』</p>
<p>往往有許多子女長大以後，跟父母一天天的疏離。我們卻能夠得到格外的接近，在不忘記前途的爭取中，仍保持著家庭的溫愛，我常爲這種幸福慶祝。</p>
<p>父親在過去二十多年污濁的政治潮流中沉浸了整個中年，既沒有『升官』也沒有『發財』，但是這並不使他們有絲毫懊悔。他常常可惜的倒是沒有趁較空的機會多讀點書，以及戰後所損失的五千冊書籍。近兩年來，他改業敎書，新的職業帶來的興趣，他並不以爲敎書是很清苦的事。學生們都喜歡上他的課，說他常常露著笑容，引她們開心。有一次我問她們中間的一個同學，說：</p>
<p>『你們上他的課，比別的先生開心，你們見他怕不怕呢？』她的回答很週到：</p>
<p>『雖沒有怕懼，但尊敬的心總是有的。』我覺得我們對父親所以能沒有隔膜，也不會放肆，這兩句話也同樣的中肯。</p>
<p>談到我們的將來，他希生我們能自立，卻並不責備豐富的供養。他準備將來回到故鄉去，運淡泊寗靜的生活。我有時對他說：</p>
<p>『父親，你做了幾十年的好從，至現在還有著一顆年青的心。你還可以和青年們一樣轟轟烈烈地幹一塲，也許成就更大……』他聽了往往用微笑代替回答，不知道他是首肯呢？還是昭示我們努力。</p>
<p>現在，父親經過一天的工作，靜靜的安睡。燈光下我望著他慈祥的臉，白的頭髪，感愧充滿了我的心。我只有用努力自己的前途，祝他永遠的健康和年青來報答他。</p>
<h3>米食人</h3>
<p>— 小月作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鴿</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>但在當時，秋海棠卻並沒有連帶想到這一件事，因此也就沒有把湘綺這幾句話深印在腦海裏。</p>
<p>一星期之後，他已經無法再使自己安坐在北京了，華樂園三天約定的戲唱完之後，他便告訴袁紹文和趙四等一班人說，劉玉華最近從南方回來，在香河家裏害病，有電報來要他去一次，所以不能不出門三四天。這一篇謊話別人聽了，倒果然很相信，只是無法瞞過榮奎；他想自己和三老板是差不多永遠在一起的，這幾天工夫裏，何嘗見過有電報給他呢？</p>
<p>『這裏頭一定有文章！』當他把秋海棠送出大門的時候，便禁不住暗暗這樣想。</p>
<p>秋海棠卻萬萬料不到這小子會如此生心，跨上火車，便巴不得立刻就到天津；然而火車究竟不是他造的，也不是爲他一個人而開的，在規定的鐘點以前，他當然祗有坐在車廂裏發悶的份兒。</p>
<p>『忘記沒有向袁紹文打聽一下，不知道老袁幾時也想到天津去。』在悶坐的時候，他才想起自己動身以前，竟沒有顧忌到這一點。可是再一想，心又放下了，第一，他以爲老袁無論那一天從北京動身，湘綺那裏總應該有些消息；第二，他想自己只在糧米街走動，不到袁家去，彼此也就絕對不會撞見了。</p>
<p>可是一見到湘綺，他才知道自己所料的有一些不對。</p>
<p>『他的脾氣太古怪，每次來從不先通知我。』湘綺倒一直還住在糧米街的家裏，和七八天前一樣，因此秋海棠竟不需再費寫信約會的手續，便馬上見到了她；待秋海棠問起了袁寶藩的消息之後，她便皺著眉頭這樣說：『所以我第二封信上就勸你少上天津來，反正我們的心已永遠拴在一起，身子疏遠些有什麽關係呢……！？』</p>
<p>湘綺今天穿的還是一身很樸素的布衣，只是髪髻上插著一朶尚未全放在紫紅色的雛菊，似乎另外又添了一重風韻。（七三）</p>

<h3>「返魂香」</h3>
<p>— 莫野</p>
<p>這是一部由囂俄名著「狄四娘」加以改編的劇本，在時裝片的浪潮中，它是較之那些「啼笑咽緣」之類的片子，有着顯著的高下；雖然題材的發展與形成，還離不開兒女之私，掙脫戀愛的範疇。</p>
<p>「返魂香」的改成中國化，全劇的氣魄情調，都能保持原有作風；分塲也很簡潔，允其是過塲戲，並不感到如何瑣煩，這是改編者的得意之筆。又能處處以危險緊張抓住觀衆，這是他成功的地方。</p>
<p>自然有許多地方，還是値得商榷的，諸如不適合現實的中國，故事又渲染蒼那麽濃厚的偶然性，人物性格的與現實人生的脫離，這些可以說都有改善的餘地。</p>
<p>題材之必須突出主題，那是無異於讀書的要用功一樣，「返魂杳」的主題是相當可取的，反軍閥惡勢力的成長，全劇又以很多的塲面，暴露着軍閥政治的黑暗，無辜良民的被慘殺，片初即把無恥者的殘酷，揭露於觀衆之前，繼之以金大帥的兇逞，副官長的醜臉，似一面照妖鏡似的，透澈地形象於觀衆之前。</p>
<p>導演似乎是勝過他前一次的作品——「雪豔娘」的。有氣氛，每個塲面都非常緊張，不流於鬆困，這是他唯一成功的地方。</p>
<p>國產電影有着這麼一個惡劣的傾向，膠片的剪接太馬虎，甚至為什麼要剪接，有許多導演尚不能瞭解其所以然。其實鏡頭的呆滯，一半是膠片的太冗長，分散了觀衆的注意力。「返魂香」似乎已力矯此弊，節奏的快慢，也非常合理，確實的，羅靜私訪白麗珠這一塲面，如以靜的旋律，可增加情調的幽美，對於空氣也會有着莫大的幫助。</p>
<p>黃河的以正式小生姿態出現，在銀慕上還是第一次。無疑的，他還不能把舞台上過火的動作，一洗淸凈，無論是臉部表情，內心表現，一看即見其火氣重重。</p>
<p>英茵最成功也是最値得嘉許的地方，那就是劇中人內心情緒的呈現。姚玉蟾是一個久歷風霜的人，她一心愛着她的表弟羅靜，藉此想我得些人生的樂趣，當她知道她的意中人戀着另一個人的時候，那人又是她的恩人；為愛人，為報恩，內心矛盾的交織，倚在壁上訴說着憂悒，這一段是很可貴的表演。其餘角色平平，就是屠光啟亦未見如何進步。</p>
<h3>奮鬥的人生觀</h3>

<p>為了奮鬥你要犧牲金錢，犠牲幸福，犧牲名譽，犧牲精力，甚至犠牲性命，要犧牲什麽，便犧牲什麽。常人對於金錢幸福名譽精力，都肯犠牲，逢到要犧牲性命，就要吝惜，於是許多奮鬥，功敗垂成</p>

<p>在這個時候，李自成等已擾及河南，河南各地災民和綠林嚮馬等乘勢響應，竟成土崩瓦解，不可收拾。那杞縣自然也不免捲入游渦之中，風聲鶴唳，一夕數驚，大家傳說某山的强盜已和李自成結合，不日將來進攻縣城了；有的說某處的土匪將要前來焚劫縣城，已暗派不少黨羽，喬作飢民，混人城中，預備裹應外合了。杞縣令見情勢如此嚴重，不得不謀安定人心。先命當地駐軍感百餘人，由馬守備率領了，到城外一面坡駐紮，因為那地方是個衝要之區，可以抵抗流寇的。又感覺到城防的不足，便招募壯丁，幫同守城。因素知李信在本地頗有聲望，門客甚衆，地方上人對終他很信仰，所以特地差人請李信進城，共議大事。李信以保衛桑梓，義無可辭，遂允許杞縣令同負守城之責。立即回到自己莊中，收拾收拾，將自己的眷屬送入城中居住；至於莊裹早吩咐家丁看守，聚集了十數門客，預備馬上進城去。他忽然想着了許靖，便教莊丁去請許靖過來一談。那許靖自從送別張蒼虬陳飛等去後，他心裹充滿着投筆請纓的壯志，再沒有心思伏案讀書了。而他的老母這幾天有些不適，半日睡，半日起的，茶飯减少，疲倦無神。許靖雖會請了一個大夫前來診治，可是服了藥後，也不奏效。他心裏自然有些煩悶，又聞得外面時局不太平的消息，和土匪攻城的謠耳，更是不安，坐在書室中書空咄咄，無可奈何。忽見李家莊有人來請他前去，他就跟着來人跑到了李家壯，和李信相見。李信便將這事告知他，要請許靖相助合作。許靖當然一口允諾。遂回去教劉三雇一肩小轎前來，載着他的母親先送到城中去，和李信的衆人一同居住。因為土匪到來時，城外難免首先遭劫，還是城中尚可堅守。但他把這事在他母親面前很含糊的說過，恐防直說了，他母親年老之人又當有病之時，受不起這個驚嚇的。並吩咐劉三同往好好服侍老太太，帶了幾笙箱籠而去。　（三〇）</p>

<h3>U.S. Decides to Provide Economic Aid to Strengthen China's Fighting Power; British and American Consultations on Far East Defense Cooperation; British Commander-in-Chief Pownall Arrives in Hong Kong from the Philippines</h3>
<p>Washington – A senior government official stated yesterday that the United States intends to intensify its economic power to simultaneously weaken the Axis powers and strengthen the position of the United States and other countries opposed to the Axis. The spokesperson indicated that most of the government's measures are consistent with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's recent observation, namely, that the military phase of the Sino-Japanese War has become a thing of the past, favoring China. Hereafter the main point of the war lies in the economic aspect. Various signs here yesterday all indicated that the government is planning to implement the following seven economic activities more directly: (1) The United States has provided great assistance to China, Britain, and Greece, and has approved assistance worth $8,300,000,000 to these three countries. (2) The United States, through embargoes and export license systems, controls countless major raw materials to ensure that they do not benefit the enemy. The spokesperson stated that such items will be subject to even stricter controls when necessary. (3) The United States, by controlling shipping and shipbuilding power, is able to maintain transportation lines to friendly countries while also seizing enemy cargo ships. (4) The United States, through the purchase of military raw materials such as steel, coal, and tin, has shown friendship to certain countries while also enhancing its own war preparedness. (5) The vast reserves of food stored by the United States are an economic weapon, which will be used hereafter with a prudent attitude to assist friendly and neutral countries. (6) The United States is capable of using a $200 billion stabilization fund to assist friendly countries' currencies. (7) The United States, by freezing the assets of certain countries, can prevent such funds from being transferred to unfriendly countries to the detriment of America's friends. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday, citing news from New York, the U.S. government is currently considering banning gasoline shipments to Japan, reportedly to prevent American goods from being transshipped to Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Manila – Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Station, departed from here today for Hong Kong. During his two-day stay here, Phillips met with Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and Major General Grunert, commander of the Philippines Department. According to the Manila "Tribune", Phillips will return here within a week for a few days. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – It is confirmed that British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Admiral Phillips, yesterday, while consulting with U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart and Philippine military advisor General Grunert in Manila, comprehensively discussed the strategic position of the Philippines in the defense of British and American territories in the South Pacific. This is reportedly the first time that British and American military representatives in the Far East have made contact in this way. Washington has not yet received the details of yesterday's talks, but well-informed sources say that the outcome of the talks will certainly enable British and American defense plans in the South Pacific to achieve closer links. Here, all circles are paying great attention to Phillips's visit to the Philippines and Hong Kong. Observers say that since the Italian Navy's defeat in the Adriatic Sea, there is hope for a relaxation of the situation in the Pacific. The naval power of Britain and the United States has also greatly increased compared to before October. (News Agency Report, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – Paul Vories McNutt, administrator of the Federal Security Agency, and generally regarded as a spokesman for Roosevelt, recently delivered a speech at a Far East issues forum, strongly urging the United States to provide all possible assistance to China in its war against Japan. McNutt, a former High Commissioner to the Philippines, said that although Japan could threaten the United States, he did not believe that the United States needed to wage war against Japan. However, the United States cannot abandon its position in Asia and seek compromise with any foreign country. McNutt opposed Congress's resolution to grant complete independence to the Philippines, saying that if the United States withdraws from the Pacific, it will seriously damage the prestige of the United States as a world-class nation and cause irreparable economic losses. McNutt also said that the Sino-Japanese War already has the character of preliminary actions on the outer defensive line of the Philippines and is intertwined with our hopes for peace. Therefore, he told people that all economic assistance given to China is also strengthening our own outer defensive line. (Aviation News, March 15)</p>
<p>New York – The "New York Times" stated today that the British-American naval and military consultations held in Manila are not intended to react to the close contact of the Axis powers, but are the natural and reasonable result of the gradual clarification of the situation in East Asia. The interests of Britain and the United States in Asia are parallel, tending towards a common goal, namely, that Eastern countries can freely solve their own problems. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Burma Plans to Build Railroad to Facilitate Transportation to China</h3>
<p>Rangoon – The Burmese House of Representatives, in a motion to adjourn, discussed the Yunnan-Burma Railway due to the growing danger of Burma being drawn into the vortex of the Far East war. Several members argued that Burma should build the railway with funds provided by the British government so that Burma would have full management rights over the road. Defense Councilor Crawchet said that China has requested transit of goods through Burma, and Burma has no reason to refuse, as China is Burma's great neighbor. Is it wise for a small country not to be friendly to a large neighbor? Prime Minister Saw denied that the construction of the new railway was in danger of being strategically outflanked.

<h3>Important Changes in the Konoe Cabinet; Toyota Appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry; Suzuki Appointed President of the Planning Board</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Prime Minister Konoe received imperial approval this afternoon for the appointment of Vice Admiral Teijiro Toyoda of the Navy Ministry as Minister of Commerce and Industry and Lieutenant General Suzuki, acting president of the Asia Development Board, as president of the Planning Board. Given Konoe's remarks to reporters on April 1, that there was no intention to reshuffle the cabinet, the general public is surprised by these changes to important economic positions in the cabinet. The ceremonies of appointment for both men will be held tonight. The original Minister of Commerce and Industry was Kobayashi, and the president of the Planning Board was Hoshino. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Talks Between Generalissimo Chiang and Communist Party Representatives in Summer of the 28th Year of the Republic; First Announcement by Chinese Magazine</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The bi-weekly magazine "The Chinese" today announced for the first time the contents of talks between Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Communist Party delegation members Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying on June 10, 1939. Generalissimo Chiang specially invited Zhou and Ye for these talks because of the many frictions between the Communist Party and the Central Government.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Generalissimo Chiang explained that the focus of the current Communist Party issue is not the land in a few counties in northern Shaanxi, but whether the Communist Party will sincerely obey the orders of the Central Government and implement national laws, setting an example for the Chinese revolutionary movement and not placing itself outside the national system, creating a special status, and setting a bad precedent for other reactionary elements seeking to establish independent authority. As the leader of the national revolutionary movement, in handling state affairs, he takes the upright position of the state in everything, does not listen to the private words of individuals or groups, or take a biased attitude. All resolutions are based on the state and the nation, for the sake of the doctrine of the revolutionary movement, and never seeks compromise or favoritism. The Communist Party often creates special situations in order to solve certain problems, intending to exert pressure. As the leader of the national revolutionary movement, he must fairly resolve various problems in the spirit of revolution, so he cannot tolerate this attitude. He then urged the Communist Party to sincerely obey the orders of the Central Government and restore normalcy. If they do so, then he will never discriminate against the Communist Party. He said that he always emphasizes benevolence in this matter, and this is also true of the Communist Party. All orders or reprimands are actually for the sake of protecting the Communist Party, hoping that the party can set a good example in the national revolutionary movement. Everything he does has national unification and independence as its sole purpose. If there is no unification, then there can be no independence, so the effort to achieve unification is entirely for the benefit of the state and the nation, which should also be the goal of the Chinese Communist Party. According to the magazine, a new publication in Chongqing, its articles almost all discuss Communist Party affairs. The latest issue exposes Ye Ting, commander of the New Fourth Army, and blames Xiang Ying, deputy commander of the army, saying that Xiang disobeyed the orders of the commander-in-chief and only obeyed the directives of the Yan'an Communist Party authorities.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Hold Conference</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to the Central Daily News, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia held a conference in Singapore. Representatives from Chinese communities in the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines participated. The conference concluded yesterday, and unanimously elected Tan Kah Kee to continue serving as the chairman of the Joint Council of the China Relief Fund Committee. They also sent telegrams to the British and American governments to express thanks for their aid to China, and telegrams to the National Government to express their loyalty.

<h3>Children's Day Celebration Held in Guiyang</h3>
<p>Guiyang – Guiyang enthusiastically celebrated Children's Day. A celebration meeting was held at noon, with over ten thousand children in attendance. They passed a resolution to send telegrams of respect to Chairman Lin Sen and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, as well as telegrams of慰問to the soldiers at the front. They also sent telegrams of greetings to the children of the nation and to children around the world. After the meeting, a fundraising event was held, with the participating children being extremely enthusiastic and achieving excellent results. (News Agency Report, 4th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Shanghai People's Food Supply in the Third Stage</h3>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai is rising daily, and the rice market is deteriorating daily. Looking back, it can be said that it has now entered the third stage. Since rice and grain in the occupied areas were looted, the price of rice in Shanghai began to rise, leading to the method of setting a price limit for national rice. And when the price limit was relaxed but still could not be maintained, it was finally forced to be abandoned, this was the first stage. This stage lasted from after the Chinese army withdrew westward to the end of the 28th year of the Republic of China. The price rose directly from about 20 yuan per picul to more than 40 yuan. Then, from the abandonment of the national rice price limit, to the exclusive evaluation of the price of foreign rice, and the rise of foreign rice to the main position in the diet of residents, it lasted for a year until the rice and grain evaluation committee virtually disappeared at the end of March of this year. It repeatedly broke through the price limit, resulting in secret price subsidies, and the price of rice gradually became ten times higher than before the war, such as the foreign rice price of more than 110 yuan in March of this year, this was the second stage. During this period, the rice price surge was the most violent. Now, the third stage is just beginning, the future is long, and there are many changes. When will it come to an end? Probably after the quelling of the rebellion?</p>
<p>Looking at the overall trend and weighing the situation, the people's food supply in the third stage is self-evidently the most serious period, but it is also not necessarily a time of change. Looking at it from the perspective of change: (1) the seasonal changes of rice and grain become more intense as summer approaches. The period of shortage between crops is approaching, and it is already rising in normal times, and it is even worse now. (2) Fertilizers such as bean cake are all extremely expensive; in addition, if food is expensive, then labor is also expensive. Since the production cost of rice is high, the price of new rice is also difficult to level. (3) If the parasitic groups are not removed for a single day, then even if the output in the occupied areas is abundant, it will still not alleviate the urgency of the people's food supply. Moreover, they are still competing with us for overseas grain. The reason why Saigon rice is not coming is that there are 700,000 tons being transported. (4) Not only is there no rice being transported from the occupied areas to Shanghai, but Shanghai is relied upon for relief. As a result, Shanghai rice merchants are even more hoarding goods, the rise in rice prices is well-justified, and the hoarding wind is irresistible. (5) With the outbreak of the European war, many ships were requisitioned. With the shortage of ships, the water freight rate is rising steadily. If, as rumored in the market, it costs 140 shillings to transport a ton of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai, which is almost equal to the price of a ton of rice, then half of the cost of a picul of rice in Shanghai is transportation costs. If the war is prolonged and the freight rate rises again, will it not cause the price of rice to rise accordingly? (6) It is difficult to ask for a reasonable solution to the Shanghai grain market. Although the theory is good, it does not match the facts; although the intention is good, it cannot be communicated with human feelings. It is neither possible to act rashly, nor can it be perfunctorily. Nor can it be biased towards the interests of one part, and think that this is all there is to food administration. All these biased views will not only fail to benefit the people's food supply, but will also make it more chaotic like untangling silk.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it seems that there is no solution to the Shanghai people's food supply, but this is not the case. What is most difficult today is the inability to use Chinese grain to relieve China's urgent needs, so we have to seek it from foreign lands. If we seek it from foreign lands, then the market price will be at the mercy of others, and the various additional losses such as exchange rates, transportation, and insurance cannot be avoided, and the price of rice is not easy to stabilize. Since this is already a fact, then we can only endure the pain of temporarily high-priced rice and grain, and wait for the future. Although the rice of Thailand and Vietnam is monopolized by Japanese merchants, what Japanese merchants trade with is not cash, but Japanese goods, which are not willingly accepted by the people of Thailand and Vietnam. Moreover, there are things that cannot be exchanged for Japanese goods, and there is still rice from Burma. Burmese rice is not easy to buy without cash. If you want to compete with China for purchase, the method of competition is the same as China's, which is foreign exchange. This is something that the Japanese do not do, and they have no power to do so. Burma is a British colony, and China and Britain are planning to cooperate, so using Burmese grain to relieve China's food supply, using British merchants' ships to transport British colonial grain, even in the autumn of frequent military transport, it is not difficult to allocate some to meet the needs of the Chinese people's food supply. This should be a matter that is permitted by reason and sentiment. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council already has a ship chartering committee, so there is no need to worry that transportation will not be sufficient; the water freight problem will also be resolved relatively well with the solution of the ship chartering problem. In order to protect the security of the concession, the French Concession Bureau will inevitably take the same steps, transporting Vietnamese rice to Shanghai, thinking that it will not disappear because it is transported by Japanese merchants. In this way, rice and grain in Shanghai may be expensive, but it will not be out of stock. If we are concerned about Japan's southward advance, which will prevent Burmese rice from coming as well, although this is not an over-concern, the changes in the world are difficult to predict. What the Japanese value most is to subdue people without fighting. Now the war in East Africa is expected to end, the changes in the Balkans are unpredictable, and the United States' assistance to constitutional countries is proceeding step by step. The British and American military commanders in the Far East are also in close talks. As a result, Matsuoka was about to travel to Europe, but suddenly there was news that he had been summoned back home. Then, the issue of realizing the southward advance becomes even more confusing. How do you know that you don't worry about the disaster of paper-made wooden houses, abandon Zhang and vote for Wei, and appease them? Even if it is not the case, now the ships of the Municipal Council are transferring food needed by local people. In any case, they should not willingly destroy and hinder the transportation of grain in a corner of Shanghai. This can also be proved by the fact that the transportation of food to the French free zone is not subject to blockade restrictions. Shanghai is not France, which can further believe that it will not be interfered with. In this way, even if there is a war in Southeast Asia, in Shanghai's position, it is not difficult to obtain possible relief from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. What is difficult is the distribution problem of Shanghai rice and grain. This problem is extremely complicated. Distributing grain according to households and purchasing rice in groups are theoretically good, but how much does group purchase of rice benefit the Shanghai people's food supply? Or it has never been the case. Distributing grain according to population is even more difficult and cannot be done in a hurry. Even managing the distribution of cheap grain is still easy to do, but people still say that there is collusion and embezzlement from it; they also say that they rely on power to buy strongly, and no one dares to say anything; or they buy and sell together, and sell to other places to make profits. The truly poor people have to run around for days without being able to buy rice; then if you want to distribute grain according to population, if there is no detailed population survey first, followed by household registration changes, if you still entrust it to rice shops and rice numbers to resell to food households, then the leakage will be huge and the abuses will be endless. Then how can we distinguish whether they are poor people or non-poor people buying? As for the grain transported by the Ship Chartering Committee of the Municipal Council, whether it will be grain for commercial use or for public use, there has been no definite decision. If it is grain for public use, and there is a meaning of helping the poor, then the issue of how to distribute and resell the grain, check and prevent abuses is also difficult. Moreover, commercial rice will also be transported to supply the needs of the city's food supply, then the quality of the rice does not have to be limited to any number, and the government should still have considerable control in all aspects of procurement and sales. It is important to know that dealing with the entire food problem is not a passive relief effort, but an active construction. Now that we are困于环境, unable to adjust from production, and only remedy the transportation and sales, it is appropriate to take advantage of the fact that the price limit is being invisibly removed, which is the most appropriate time to correct the management of Shanghai's food supply. First, the price of rice is already so high, second, the existing stock is so abundant, third, the orders are so abundant, and transportation and water freight have a considerable solution, then what is lacking is only an imperfect distribution method. To remove the excess, supplement the deficiency, and put it into the궤物, it is not difficult to find someone who can take on this difficult task in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee - Summary of Resolutions: Centralized Management of Land Taxes in All Provinces; Establishment of a Ministry of Trade and a Ministry of Food within the Executive Yuan; Mobilizing All Resources to Establish a Wartime Economic System</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from Yesterday) Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee:</p>
<p>(3) In order to meet wartime needs, it is proposed to transfer the management of land taxes in all provinces to the central government for unified planning and reorganization (submitted by the Director-General). Approved by resolution.</p>
<p>Main points of the proposal and reasons: Land tax in our country has always been a national tax. Since the promulgation of the standards for the division of national and local revenue and expenditure in the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], land tax has been classified as local revenue. Provinces have regarded it as a major source of income, and most have increased land taxes to meet their needs, resulting in inconsistent tax rates and various surcharges. The burden is uneven, and the people are troubled by it. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of reorganization, requested the approval of the land reporting method and supervised the provinces to complete it within a time limit. After several years of implementation, some progress has been made, but since the outbreak of the war, most of it has been suspended. However, simultaneous progress in resistance and construction is the established national policy of the central government, and the aforementioned reporting method should be actively continued. Recently, food prices have soared, and land profits have increased, affecting military and civilian food supplies. It is impossible to enrich the country and benefit the people without reorganizing land taxes. Wartime finance relies on unified planning, and the central and local governments are a unified whole. Division leads to small scale and difficulty in advancement, while unity leads to strength and rapid results. Therefore, in order to adjust local revenue and expenditure and balance the land burden, it is urgent to transfer the collection of land taxes in all provinces to the central government for reorganization in order to meet the needs of the war. The reasons are as follows: (1) The tax rates for land tax in various localities are inconsistent and uneven, and limited by their location, it is impossible to carry out large-scale reforms. After central management, it is possible to actively complete land reporting and handle land value tax, so that tax rates are fair and excessive charges are abolished. (2) After the central government reorganizes land taxes and taxes land value appropriately, the revenue can be increased by more than four times compared to the current amount. In addition to offsetting the originally set amount of land tax, financial assistance can be appropriately provided based on the financial situation of various localities, so that local education, culture, healthcare, and sanitation can be effectively promoted, and national economic construction can be evenly developed through financial regulation. (3) According to the National Construction Outline, the burden of each county on the central government should be a percentage of the annual income of each county for central government expenses. Therefore, land tax revenue cannot be exclusively for local use. If it is managed by the central government, the central government's unified revenue and expenditure can lead to a reasonable allocation. (4) In order to regulate military and civilian food supplies in various regions, the central government can make overall plans and adjust the situation of supply and demand in various regions, changing to levy in kind, storing, transporting, and providing relief, so that production and sales can be balanced and food prices can be stabilized. (5) When land tax is unified by the central government for unified revenue and expenditure, the connection between central and local finances will be closer, and the local tax system can be effectively adjusted under the guidance of the central government. All conflicting taxes can be abolished. (6) Centralized collection of land tax by the central government will make affairs and expenses more rational and economical.</p>
<p>Methods (Omitted)</p>
<p>(4) Proposal to establish a Ministry of Trade and a Ministry of Food within the Executive Yuan (submitted by the Director-General). Approved by resolution.</p>
<p>The original proposal involves the management of import and export trade and foreign barter, as well as the management of national food. In this wartime, its mission is particularly important. It is proposed to establish a Ministry of Trade and a Ministry of Food within the Executive Yuan to strengthen its powers and increase its business efficiency. The original Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the National Food Administration should be abolished. A special request is made to the Congress for a decision.</p>
<p>(5) Proposal to actively mobilize human, material, and financial resources to establish a wartime economic system (submitted by the Presidium). Approved by resolution and referred to the Standing Committee for attention.</p>
<p>Original text of the proposal and reasons: In wartime, the sustainability of a nation's economic strength is the key to final victory, and the ability of economic strength to cooperate with military development depends on the soundness of its organization and flexible application. Since our country has been at war for three and a half years, measures in various economic sectors have established a solid foundation. At present, the Japanese military has been trapped in a difficult situation for a long time, and is only focusing on economic blockade against us, gradually pressing closer. However, the prices in our rear still have a tendency to gradually rise. Therefore, future countermeasures should actively mobilize national human, material, and financial resources to strengthen the wartime economic system, so as to increase production, ensure fair distribution, and strictly implement frugal consumption, so that all economic forces can be used in a planned and controlled manner. The needs of the military will be guaranteed, and the certainty of victory in the war lies in this. Therefore, the current priority is to establish a wartime economic system and implement wartime economic laws and regulations, so that personnel serving in economic affairs are aware of the special importance of their responsibilities, and the general public should also attach importance to the status and contribution of economic personnel, so as to actively improve the spirit of self-reliance and self-respect of economic personnel, and to achieve the goal of economic combat victory. It is urgent to first decide the basic policy by the Congress and hand it over to the competent government authorities to earnestly formulate specific implementation methods and organizations. Now, we respectfully propose ten outlines for establishing a wartime economic system for discussion at the meeting. Please make a public decision.</p>
<p>Basic Outlines for Establishing a Wartime Economic System: (1) Confirm that the economic struggle in the current situation is the main key to victory, abandon all outdated and untimely economic concepts, and replace them with the basic beliefs of military first and economic national defense, and establish the direction of efforts for the wartime economic system. (2) All Party comrades should deeply understand the importance of the new era of national defense economic policies, lead the national people, and promote it with all their strength, regardless of any difficulties and costs, to achieve the ultimate goal of victory in the war. (3) Decide on unified steps, and set a minimum period to enrich and adjust economic institutions at all levels, paying special attention to basic organizations such as financial and tax authorities, cooperative organizations, transportation agencies, anti-smuggling agencies, and salt and grain management agencies, and establish sound economic institutions as a stronghold for the implementation of comprehensive economic control. (4) Mobilize national professionals and allocate them to economic institutions at all levels, so that they can take on management and technical work, determine their powers and responsibilities, and protect their status, so that they can become cadres for economic operations. (5) Mobilize outstanding young people across the country, conduct short-term training, and fill the ranks of economic combatants. Their importance should be recognized as equal to that of soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front line, and the state should give them the same preferential treatment and awards as front-line soldiers. (6) Mobilize workers, farmers, and women across the country to organize and train them in stages and actively engage in production. (7) Economic institutions should be unified under military management and scientific management, with clear division of responsibilities, simplified procedures, to achieve military-style speed and reality, and determine efficiency standards, and conduct regular assessments. The treatment of personnel at all levels should be adjusted to make it rational, and paid in kind when necessary. (8) For people's economic activities, from the production process to final consumption, a systematic plan should be made for control, and gradually strengthened, so that it can be fully controlled to match military operations. (9) For key businesses such as finance, trade, transportation, and production, the expansion of state-owned enterprises, the combination of private enterprises, and the strengthening of ties should be used to make them an entire collective of economic operations, and public operation methods and financial means should be used to strive for fair distribution. For the minimum needs of people's lives, the government should make overall plans, stabilize prices, and distribute them through public and cooperative means. At the same time, mobilize the people to strictly implement frugality and gradually develop the habit of collective life. (3rd Dispatch)(End)</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Conversation with British Reporters: Highly Praising the Indomitable Spirit of the British; British Government and Public Expressed Regret at Guo's Return to China</h3>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, who has been newly appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs and is about to return to China to take office, told reporters from the Daily Telegraph today that he felt a mixture of regret and hope at his decision to leave the United Kingdom. He said that he was deeply reluctant to part with the friends he had made in the United Kingdom over the past eight or nine years, and that he admired the indomitable spirit of the British people in recent months. He added that the Chinese people had had the same experience, and that he knew that the spirit of the British people had never flagged even in the darkest times.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Chinese people is also the same, because bombing can often strengthen the determination of free people. The diplomatic correspondent of the Times claimed that British diplomatic circles and many non-official figures would express infinite regret at the departure of Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. During his tenure as ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo handled his country's affairs with a calm and persistent attitude. There would have been many disappointments, but he never showed any pain. His departure now comes at a time when the cause of freedom-loving people around the world has been united. President Roosevelt has placed China alongside Britain and Greece, and Britain, which has aided China in many ways, has also firmly refused to sacrifice China in the Far East to seek a compromise. Guo has earned the respect of all for his difficult work, and his new position will be even more difficult at a time when the Japanese Foreign Minister is seeking to sever Soviet aid to China. As Guo departs from the United Kingdom to return to China, he is asked to bring back the blessings and respect of one country resisting aggression to another country with the same fate, and to convey them to the Chairman of China.

<h3>Academia Sinica Establishes Ant Guangyan Scholarship</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The late Ant Guangyan, an overseas Chinese in Thailand, spared no effort in promoting and supporting overseas Chinese education in Thailand and schools in the motherland. After Ant's martyrdom, overseas Chinese in Thailand held a public memorial service and collected 25,000 yuan in paper money. Ant's family upheld his last wishes, and in addition to all the paper money, they raised a huge sum of money to raise a total of 50,000 national currency, which was handed over to the Thai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to transfer it to Academia Sinica to set up (Ant Guangyan Academic Scholarship) to promote culture and commemorate it. Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, has sent this scholarship to Academia Sinica, and it is said that the Academy has agreed to set up (Ant Guangyan Academic Scholarship) and is currently drafting implementation methods, which will be announced soon. In addition, Academia Sinica has set up two kinds of scholarships in memory of the late cadres Yang Quan and Ding Wenjiang, namely the Yang Quan Scholarship and the Ding Wenjiang Scholarship. In the previous year, Li Juncheng, an overseas Chinese in Singapore, donated 100,000 yuan in national salvation public bonds to set up the Li Juncheng Scholarship. This decision added the Ant Guangyan Academic Scholarship, and a total of four scholarships were set up. (4th Dispatch)</p>

The discussion was very heated. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Address</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang's address on the opening day of the National Cooperation Conference is as follows: "The Ministry of Social Affairs is convening the National Cooperation Conference, which I believe is of great significance, and I hope it will achieve very good results. Our war and national construction must be firmly based on the Three People's Principles as the highest criterion, and then the war can be won and the national construction can be successful. Therefore, our social and economic construction must also have the characteristics of the Three People's Principles cooperative enterprise. In the spirit of equality, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and with the means of peaceful struggle, self-reliance, and regeneration, we can unite our forces, transform society, and establish a new social and economic system that is fully consistent with the ideals of the Three People's Principles national, democratic, and livelihood construction. Therefore, your joint efforts in promoting cooperative enterprises are worthy of being the backbone of the Three People's Principles construction. In recent years, our country's cooperative enterprises have shown a sudden leap forward, which is very gratifying. In the future, the universal implementation of the new county system and the cooperative enterprises will proceed in coordination, and its development should be even more rapid. However, to date, cooperative administration in various provinces, cities, and counties is not fully sound, cooperative enterprises have not been able to enrich cooperative education, and cooperative finance needs to be flexible and smooth. In the future, we must earnestly reorganize and strive for improvement, so that the Three People's Principles social and economic construction can truly establish a foundation in cooperative enterprises. There are high expectations. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German Troops Assist in North Africa; British Troops Abandon Benghazi and Retreat to Positions North of Agedabia; British Troops in East Africa Force Massawa to Surrender</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to the German military headquarters, after a German-Italian coalition force engaged British troops in North Africa, the British troops lost the bases of El Agheila and Biri Sulah and retreated from Agedabia. At the same time, they were repeatedly bombed by German and Italian air forces. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Cairo - It was officially announced that after the advance British troops in Libya retreated to positions north of Agedabia (about 100 miles south of Benghazi), the British troops in the Cyrenaica area had also withdrawn from the key port of Benghazi. Benghazi was occupied by the British troops who advanced rapidly along the coast from Derna on February 6. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin - In North Africa, German and Italian troops occupied Himennes south of Benghazi yesterday. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>London - A special correspondent for Reuters with the army reported that the British army has now demanded the surrender of the port of Massawa. A total of 3,000 Italian soldiers captured by the British army in Asmara. Cairo has issued a special bulletin explaining the reasons for the withdrawal from Benghazi, stating that in view of the strong German and Italian troops advancing resolutely with many tanks and in order to choose our own battlefield, all the light cover units have been withdrawn to choose a concentrated area. Benghazi is militarily indefensible and the British army did not use it as a port. This time, all the captured military supplies and equipment were destroyed before the withdrawal. The British army inflicted heavy losses on enemy vehicles, soldiers, and tanks. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A British military spokesman here said last night that before the British army entered Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, the Italian colonial army rioted and looted the city. The Italian bishop and police chief of the city, in order to protect the safety of the Italian families in the city, appealed to the British army to occupy the city and restore order. From this, it can be seen that the remaining Italian army in East Africa is suffering from the threat of serious internal unrest. The latest British communiqué stated that the British army captured many enemies in Eritrea and obtained many cannons and a large number of war materials. They are currently advancing south from Asmara. After the enemy's mechanized army in Libya moved, the British advance troops moved to positions north of Agedabia. The spokesman said that the war in Libya was a small contact and had no special importance. In addition, the British Air Force Command in the Middle East issued a communiqué stating that the British Air Force continued to attack the Italian military transport vehicles retreating south of Asmara in Eritrea yesterday. The Free French bombed the enemy camp on the Avenue of Adduwa. Motor transport vehicles on the Taixi to Asassa Avenue were also strafed and bombed, and many vehicles were damaged. On Wednesday, four enemy bombers attempted to attack Volos (Greece) and were intercepted by central fighter planes. Three were shot down and another was severely damaged. On the 1st of this month, the British Air Force launched a night attack on the port of Tripoli, hitting the breakwater. Enemy transport vehicles were also heavily attacked and destroyed. No British aircraft were lost. The communiqué also announced that the British army had occupied Messu, about 180 miles from Addis Ababa, stating that the British aircraft and army cooperated and repeatedly bombed the enemy's formations and its traffic, which was quite effective. A British military spokesman said that after the South African army estimated Messu, it is now putting pressure on the enemy. Cairo expects Addis Ababa to be declared a demilitarized city, because there are many Italian women and children there. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Night Attack on German Naval Base; Two 20,000-Ton German Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>London - This afternoon, the Ministry of Aviation announced that during the British aircraft's air raid on Brest last night, it was witnessed that the German 26,000-ton battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had sunk. The Scharnhorst was the first battlecruiser built by Germany after the Great War. The Gneisenau was its sister ship. It was launched in 1934 and completed on May 21, 1938. The Gneisenau was completed in September of the same year. The ship's military equipment includes nine 11-inch heavy guns, twelve 5.9-inch guns, fourteen 4.1-inch anti-aircraft guns, sixteen 37-caliber anti-aircraft guns, and four aircraft. The total number of crew members is 1,461. The Scharnhorst officially joined the fleet for service in Wilhelmshaven on January 7, 1939. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Southern Government Has Already Announced: The Capital Is a Demilitarized City; The Southern Prime Minister Is Determined to Uphold Independence; Machek Accepts the Position of Deputy Prime Minister</h3>
<p>London – Southern National Capital Radio claimed last night that the Southern Capital had been declared a "demilitarized city," and the authorities warned the people to implement a blackout at any time. At the same time, Southern Capital officially announced that Croat leader Machek had accepted the position of Deputy Prime Minister in the new Southern National Government. According to news from Southern Capital, Machek is now departing from Zagreb to head to Southern Capital with the belief of doing his utmost to maintain peace and join the Simović cabinet. Machek said to guests, "I believe that I should do my best to maintain peace, which is the highest blessing for mankind. I deeply believe that the Serbian leaders and people also sincerely desire peace." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Southern National Mobilization: Already Completed</p>
<p>Rome – According to Southern German refugees entering the country, passenger trains in Southern National are now completely suspended, and only military vehicles can pass. Although the general mobilization has not been announced by the authorities, it has already been completed. Reservists of the Serbian ethnic group born in 1893 have also been mobilized, and the descendants of Germans have been mobilized up to the 1900 age group, mostly for labor services. A large number of people are now fleeing military service into the country of Romania, and the Romanian border guards are assisting the entry of German refugees. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>Germany Claims Tolerance Has Its Limits</p>
<p>A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson claimed yesterday that the shocking events regarding the latest developments in Southern National's situation are the anti-German activities of Southern National's foreign envoys, supported by the Southern National government, hoping to gain foreign intervention in Southeast Europe. Not only do the powerful countries of Europe want to interfere in Southeast Europe, but even countries across the ocean have expressed this attitude. Whether Southern National's agreement to foreign intervention is in accordance with the basic principles of the Three-Power Pact is not up for discussion at this time. The anti-German sentiment in Southern National can be seen in the anti-German demonstrations and riots. The Southern National government has not stopped these terrorist actions at all, and its diplomats have fueled the flames, making the current diplomatic and political problems even more difficult. The people of Southern National have no understanding of the serious situation caused by the government reorganization and the riots and acts of terror, and they are not aware of the scope of the crisis. The spokesperson confirmed that the German envoy to Southern National, He Lun, is still in Berlin, but did not say when he would return to his post. Regarding the rumors that Southern National's envoy, An Teli Zhi, brought a special official document from the Southern National government to Germany, he said he had not heard of it. The decision on German-Southern National relations depends on the attitude of the Belgrade government, not Berlin. Germany is observing the developments in Southern National's affairs with the greatest tolerance and patience, but it is difficult to say how long Germany's tolerance can last.

<p>New York – Travelers in the Balkans report that Germany is concentrating 200,000 of its most elite troops on the Romanian border, mostly in the 110-mile area from Timisoara to Turnu Severin. The people who witnessed this are extremely reliable. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Rumor: Southern Prime Minister Will Go to Rome</p>
<p>Vichy – It is rumored that General Simović, the Prime Minister of the Southern National Cabinet, intends to dispatch a special envoy to Rome, or go in person, to request the Italian government to mediate the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. Regarding this matter, diplomatic figures here recently said that although Italy does not want the situation in the Balkans to become unmanageable, it also does not want the relationship between Germany and Yugoslavia to break down. As for the choice of a special envoy, Southern National's Foreign Minister, Ning Xie Zhi, signed an agreement with Italy in 1934, so if there is a trip to Rome, he would be the most suitable person. Italy is unwilling to volunteer to mediate and must wait for Southern National to request it before it is willing to do so. As far as Southern National's attitude is concerned, it seems that the country wants to avoid the deterioration of the situation. After several cabinet meetings, a policy has been decided, and it is said that the content focuses on internal stability and external resistance. The Croat problem will be solved first. The Croat leader, Machek, has already accepted the position of cabinet assistant, and the agreement established in 1939 (stipulating that the Croatian region be divided into a province and granted autonomy) has also been reaffirmed by the government. In terms of diplomacy, although the new cabinet has stated that it will not neglect the obligations undertaken by the previous government in joining the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is not yet known whether the German government is willing to accept this opinion and whether Southern National will provide other guarantees such as the demobilization of the Southern National Army.

<h3>After Teleki's Suicide, Bardossy Appointed Prime Minister; Hungary's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; The Late Prime Minister's State Funeral Set for the 7th</h3>
<p>Budapest – It was announced here last night that Hungarian Foreign Minister Bardossy had been appointed Prime Minister to succeed the late Teleki. Mr. Bardossy will also serve concurrently as Foreign Minister, as a way to ensure that Hungary's foreign policy does not change. Other cabinet members have not been changed. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki was the first victim of Hungary's joining the Tripartite Pact, and committed suicide because he "could not carry out his difficult and unpleasant task." The reason why Teleki could not bear this burden was that Germany put pressure on Hungary, forcing it to break with Southern National. One of Teleki's proudest achievements during his tenure was the establishment of an agreement with Southern National, removing the cause of political friction between the two countries and establishing a foundation of harmony, cooperation, mutual trust, and economic understanding. It seems that the German side cannot tolerate its vassal state Hungary living in friendship with the independent-minded Southern National, causing Teleki to feel unable to cope with the struggle between his principles and German pressure, so he resorted to suicide. In the Hungarian capital, there is no shortage of politicians who can be used by the German side as tools and used at will, but Hungarian Regent Horthy has always been independent, so his choice of Teleki's successor, even if it does not hinder the German plan, will prevent the German plan from being realized early. Bulgaria also has a treaty of friendship with Southern National, and this treaty is welcomed by the Bulgarian people. Now the Bulgarian people are also under the same pressure and have risen in opposition. The closeness between the Bulgarian people and the Serbian people of Southern National has made a great contribution to the peace of the Balkan Peninsula. Even if the German side drives the Bulgarian people to make open expressions of hatred toward Southern National, it will be difficult to destroy the relationship between the Bulgarian and Southern National peoples. According to dispatches from the Hungarian capital, Teleki committed suicide by shooting himself in the right temple with a pistol. The official news agencies of Germany and Italy in the Hungarian capital reported that Hungarian Regent Horthy has invited Bardossy to serve as Prime Minister, and Bardossy has accepted. It is noted that Bardossy has a good reputation in London diplomatic circles, having served as a counselor and chargé d'affaires at the Hungarian Embassy in the UK for many years. He left London in 1934 to serve as the Hungarian ambassador to Romania, and became Foreign Minister in 1938. According to news from the Hungarian capital, Mr. Bardossy will continue to serve concurrently as Foreign Minister, and there will be no changes in other ministries. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>The Hungarian capital – According to news that has not yet been confirmed by the government here, it was reported yesterday that Chancellor Hitler demanded that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki have Hungary join the war and fight against [Missing country name]. After this request was made, Teleki committed suicide. Teleki was pessimistic about Hungary's future, so after a night-long cabinet meeting, he committed suicide in his bedroom yesterday morning. According to Teleki's friends, the Hungarian Prime Minister had always opposed joining the Axis powers, and recently became pessimistic about Hungary's future, predicting that Hungary might become a battlefield between the Axis powers and the Allied forces. (International News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>The Hungarian capital – The body of Cabinet Prime Minister Teleki was recently examined by forensic doctors, proving that he died by suicide at one or two o'clock this morning by shooting himself in the right forehead with a Browning pistol. According to Teleki's former attendants, when they entered the Prime Minister's bedroom at 6:45 this morning, they found his body lying on the floor, already cold. The Prime Minister ordered me last night to call him to get up as usual and prepare the Boy Scout uniform so that he could participate in the Boy Scout service this morning. His attitude was no different from usual. In addition, it is also learned that the Prime Minister left behind two letters, one to his beloved wife, and the contents of the other letter and to whom it was addressed are still unknown. As for the rumors that the Prime Minister's wife has also committed suicide, this is incorrect. However, the wife has been feeling unwell for a long time and is now recuperating in a private hospital. The government authorities have also announced that a state funeral will be held for the late Prime Minister at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Returns to Berlin from Rome; Meets with German Dignitaries Again</h3>
<p>Milan – At 11:30 last night, the special train carrying Matsuoka and his entourage arrived at the Brenner Pass. When the train arrived at the border between Germany and Italy, Matsuoka first bid farewell to the Italian officials who were escorting him, and then met with officials sent by the German Foreign Minister to greet him, and took the same train to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to news here, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is expected to arrive here from Rome at 2:25 p.m. today. He will stay here until tomorrow night and meet with German dignitaries again. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>London – Diplomatic figures here recently said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has tried to avoid taking responsibility for attacking the British colonial empire. This avoidance is obviously because Matsuoka is deeply afraid of triggering a Japanese-American war as a result. Japanese figures here said that Tokyo has ordered Matsuoka to return quickly and stop his trip to Vichy. It is speculated that this is the reason why the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Shigemitsu Aoi, changed his plan to fly to mainland Europe to meet Matsuoka. In addition, well-informed people are quite skeptical about whether Matsuoka's visit to Moscow again will produce a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union. According to reliable sources, Matsuoka's one-hour talk with Stalin last week only discussed general issues, and most of the time was spent on translation. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka may arrive here from Rome today. Many Japanese ambassadors in Europe are waiting here for the arrival of the Japanese Foreign Minister. Matsuoka has summoned most of the Japanese ambassadors, ministers, and chargés d'affaires to hold a meeting. Except for the ambassadors to Rome, London, and Moscow, the rest have arrived here today. Matsuoka left the St. Paul's Station in Rome at 8 o'clock last night, and was seen off by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and senior government officials. News from London said that Shigemitsu Aoi, the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, has cancelled his plan to meet with Matsuoka in Vichy. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Feels Resentful About Fletcher's Remarks; Britain Has Apologized to Shigemitsu</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to news reported from London, Fletcher, the Private Secretary of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Alexander, said in a certain radio speech on March 29 that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Berlin seemed to cause many British people to think about the position of the Japanese Ambassador in London. Ambassadors and their entourages often have many opportunities to report events that are beneficial to the enemy. They often observe us when we are fighting the enemy with bare hands and broomsticks. There is no reason to tolerate seemingly hostile observers in our midst while wearing kid gloves to deal with this matter. When the Information Bureau spokesman Ishii received foreign news reporters today, he mentioned this matter, saying that the Japanese ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi had asked the British Foreign Office to pay attention to Mr. Fletcher's remarks. British Under-Secretary Butler has acknowledged that his remarks are not "appropriate" and has apologized to Shigemitsu Aoi. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Inside Story of Germany During Wartime</h3>
<p>What is more serious than the damage to factories is the working time wasted by workers during air raids and the sharp decline in work efficiency caused by insomnia. The skilled workers in German munitions factories have worked incredibly long hours in the past and present. At the beginning of the war, some factory workers worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Under such circumstances, the workers' health, discipline, and efficiency were greatly hampered, so the working hours were slightly reduced later. But recently, workers in German factories still have to work an average of 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.</p>
<p>The industrialists who run factories everywhere have to go to Berlin every other week on weekends for a good sleep, which shows that the sleep problem has already affected the management of the factories. By Saturday afternoon, the doorways of the city's hotels are hung with "Do Not Disturb" signs. Inside the double-door bedrooms, one can only hear the exhausted industrial giants snoring loudly. German workers, however, cannot enjoy such a blessing of rest.</p>
<p>Until I left Berlin last December, the Basdan and Anhalter stations in the city center of Berlin had never been hit by British Air Force bombs. But later, on one occasion, the sky above Berlin did not detect British aircraft, but a mysterious explosion occurred at Anhalter station, and the building caught fire, burning down part of the station. Some of the damage in Berlin, of course, also escaped the eyes of American journalists. When Berlin was first bombed, the authorities often took us to inspect the places that were reported to have been most heavily bombed. Later, the attacks by British aircraft became commonplace, and this kind of inspection was abolished. Except for the announcements issued by the highest military command and the propaganda department, not a word of news about each bombing of Berlin was allowed to be leaked. I personally heard British bombers flying overhead several times and witnessed anti-aircraft guns in the city firing one after another, but the next day's announcement still said that British aircraft had not invaded the airspace of Berlin.</p>
<p>Why isn't the damage caused by the British Air Force bombing of Berlin very serious? This is because when the British Air Force invaded Berlin, the number of aircraft was too small and the bombs they carried were not heavy enough to cause serious damage to London like the German Air Force did. The aviation consultants of neutral countries had different estimates of the number of British aircraft attacking Berlin, but according to the closest estimates, at most 30 British aircraft bombed Berlin each night, and the average was 15. Taking the entire German territory as a whole, the number of British aircraft flying into German territory on a good night ranged from 60 to 80. The British military uses Wellington and Blenheim aircraft, which are long-range aircraft, to attack Germany. But one night, the German side shot down a modified Lockheed British aircraft in the city. The news that the German side shot down the first American aircraft in Berlin was kept strictly secret in Germany, and American journalists were not allowed to spread this news.</p>
<p>The German aircraft used heavy bombs to attack London, while the British aircraft only dropped light bombs on Berlin. The reason is very simple, it is just a mathematical relationship. The bombers used by the German Air Force to attack England only travel 200 miles round trip. There is no need to carry too much gasoline on such a short flight, and the bombs carried are 500 pounds, 1,000 pounds, and even 2,000 pounds. The British Air Force must fly 1,100 miles round trip for each attack on Berlin. They mostly carry 100-pound bombs, but later we also felt that there were also bombs weighing up to 250 pounds being dropped. In addition to bombs, the British aircraft are mostly loaded with gasoline. The American-made Flying Fortress can carry huge bombs to Berlin, carry out destruction, and then safely fly back to England. But until now, this kind of giant aircraft has not been found in the skies over Berlin. For the above reasons, the British aviation personnel are undoubtedly the bravest air force soldiers in the world. Each air raid spends a very short time searching for targets in the skies over Berlin, only a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, and they must quickly return home. They must use a stopwatch to calculate the time in seconds, because if they stay too long, there is a danger of running out of gasoline and not being able to return home. Berlin knows the details of several British aircraft being forced to land a few miles off the coast of their home country due to lack of gasoline, and this statement has been confirmed by the British side after I left Germany.</p>

<h3>Countering Axis Conspiracy: US Adopts Strong Measures, Demands Italy Recall Naval Attaché, Seized Ships Fully Requisitioned</h3>
<p>Washington - The United States yesterday demanded the departure of the Italian Naval Attaché from Washington because he was involved in the sabotage of Italian ships in American seaports. Secretary of State Hull sent a note to the Italian Ambassador to Washington, Goro, demanding the departure of Naval Attaché General Lais, because General Lais was not recognized by the US government as a diplomat. Hull stated that President Roosevelt had discovered that General Lais was not recognizable by the US government and had notified the State Department of this matter. Hull indicated in answering questions that the same consideration might be given to German diplomats. Hull's note to Ambassador Goro stated, "The US government has taken note of and is concerned about various facts and circumstances concerning General Lais, whose actions violate US law." Hull told reporters that the note was related to the damage suffered by Italian ships in US seaports. He indicated that Italy had not yet responded to the State Department's request of March 5 regarding the closure of the Italian consulates in Teterboro and Newark, which is also noteworthy. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to responsible sources here, the United States has directly rejected Germany and Italy's protests against the seizure of ships and has refused to release the ships and crews. It is reported that US Secretary of State Hull sent notes to the Axis powers last night, strongly asserting the United States' right to detain these ships. It is also reported that thirty crew members of the German ships "Memphis" and "Hammonses," which secretly left the port of Callao on Monday night, have been captured by a Peruvian cruiser and transported to Casma, 100 miles north of Callao, where they have been immediately detained. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - The United States has requisitioned a total of 28 Italian ships, 2 German ships, and 39 Danish ships, totaling 300,000 tons. A well-known public law scholar explained the confiscation, saying that according to international law, any country enjoying belligerent rights can requisition foreign ships in its territorial waters and pay fair compensation. Although this right is often exercised by belligerent countries, it is sometimes exercised by non-belligerent countries. During the last World War, many non-belligerent countries requisitioned German ships. In 1916, Italy, although not yet at war with Germany, had already requisitioned 37 German ships. In 1916, Portugal took over 72 German ships. In 1917, Brazil confiscated 42 ships. In 1919, Peru and Spain also took the same steps, with Spain confiscating over 90 ships. Although Germany protested this action, it did not declare war on Spain and Peru. When the United States declared war in 1917, it confiscated many German ships in domestic ports, but found that the engines of many ships had been severely damaged and further ruined, some ships were sunk in the harbor, and others were set on fire and destroyed. The United States, to prevent future sabotage, passed the Espionage Act in June 1917, stipulating that whenever the President declares a national emergency, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, if he deems it in the national interest, has the right to take over foreign ships in US territorial waters. It is said that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's reception last Sunday of Axis and Danish ships anchored in US ports was based on this law. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Boston - Ten German crew members were charged in court yesterday with sabotage on an oil tanker seized by the United States. The defendants refused to plead. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Nazi Organizations - Secret Activities</p>
<p>Washington - Hull told reporters that he could not currently answer the question of whether the same measures would be applied to any other German officials in the United States. Sources with close contact with the development of Central and South America now have evidence that German diplomats were involved in the self-sinking of German ships in South America, proving that President J's order to take over Axis ships was indeed appropriate. A German official named Hans, under the guise of Commercial Counselor of Guatemala in Central America, is actually the propaganda chief and leader of the Fifth Column. He recently traveled to Costa Rica, and shortly thereafter, two German ships were sunk in Costa Rican ports. Local officials generally suspect Hans of being responsible for this. It was also found that Hans used checks for $20 each in San Jose, Guatemala. It was discovered that these checks were issued by Nazi organizations from the United States for anti-American activities by secret Nazi propaganda organizations in Central America and Mexico. Therefore, Hans's participation in secret work is becoming increasingly evident. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Colon Italian Consul Arrested and Imprisoned</p>
<p>London - According to news received here today, the Italian Consul in Colon, Panama Canal Zone, has been arrested and imprisoned, and his residence has also been searched. In addition, three employees of an Italian shipping company and three crew members of the seized Italian ship "Conte Picamarno" have also been arrested. The "Conte Picamarno" was one of the four major Italian ships that sailed between Shanghai and Genoa before Italy's participation in the war, with a displacement of 23,255 tons. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Germany Arrests American Citizens in Retaliation</p>
<p>Berlin - At least seven or more Americans were arrested on Wednesday and yesterday. According to Nazi sources, their crime was in retaliation for the detention of German ships in American seaports. Police indicated that they had been completely released after being detained at the Alexanderplatz Secret Police Headquarters. United Press reporter Hodelier is still being held there. The first person arrested was Dickson of New York, a representative of the Mutual Broadcasting System and part-time employee of the Chicago bureau here.

<h3>Grain: Over 40,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in One Day, Another 4,200 Tons Arriving in the Evening</h3>
<p>Foreign rice is coming in one after another. The Yongzhen Wheel, managed by the British merchant Xia Laochen Foreign Bank, directly transported rice from Rangoon to Shanghai. The news clippings have been recorded. The wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, carrying 17,100 bags of foreign rice, and was berthed at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Java Company's new postal ship Zhizha Yun plus, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also loaded over 24,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and was berthed at the Lanyan Chuan Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The Finnish wheel Tilda, managed by the Kaiping Company, directly transported 4,200 tons of foreign rice and corn from Saigon, arriving in Shanghai at 6:00 p.m. yesterday evening, and was berthed at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market initially sold through stores and other shops. Seeing the continuous arrival of large quantities of sources, the future of the rice market seemed difficult to turn around for a while, so everyone watched and waited without actively buying. Floating hoarders first shed their goods at this time, and large-scale customer hoarders also found it difficult to persist, and continued to sell at lower prices. Each price then continued to drop by more than two yuan. At this time, a market announcement was made that it would be closed for one day for the Tomb Sweeping Festival today. Stores and customers were preparing to stock up, and coincidentally, they took advantage of the low price to rush out. In an instant, the sales turned over. The market tightened, and the market gradually rebounded. As a result, it only depreciated by one yuan compared to the previous market. Saigon No. 1 was 1089 yuan, No. 2 was 1056 yuan, Siam No. 1 was 1078 yuan, Huojiao was 107 yuan, Xiaojiao was 105 yuan and a half, 105 yuan, Zhongguan was 104 yuan and a half, 104 yuan, Tokyo sharpened tip was 978 yuan, special broken tip was 86 yuan, second was 812 yuan, British Hua Si Xiaojiao returned to the original package of road goods and also opened 126 yuan to 126 yuan and a half, the futures were 124 yuan and a half, half a yuan higher than the previous day. Stone trading in Saigon and other markets was even more active, and selling prices all saw gradual increases, more than half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market. Digestion was still active in the afternoon, and the situation continued to be strong and brisk. The total daily transaction also increased to 278,000 bags, and the original package was about 3400 tons.</p>
<p>Local stores' willingness to take in thick and thin japonica and other national rice was even weaker. The seller's insistence was ineffective, and the price finally fell by one or two yuan. Changbang special japonica saw 1178 yuan, high japonica 116 yuan, Kunshan japonica saw high japonica 1145 yuan, big market 1112 yuan, mid-second 1089 yuan, Qingjiao saw thin rice 109 yuan, 108 yuan, original package 112 yuan and 7 corners.</p>
<p>The outlet for glutinous rice was also only sporadic, but the sellers had no intention of being burdened and selling, so as a result, under their persistence, the market presented a reluctantly stable situation. Hong Kong special yuan opened at 1045 yuan, Zhongguan opened at 100 yuan, glutinous green special opening at 967 yuan, second to broken opening at 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>One Million Bags of Stored Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for foreign flour trended downward. This was because large quantities of Canadian flour arrived in Shanghai, and re-exported flour from Hong Kong kept pouring in, with total stocks reaching about one million bags. Buyers were also hesitant to purchase foreign flour, and sales were sluggish. Furthermore, local shops were offering flour at discounted prices, further reducing demand. Consequently, sellers were eager to sell, and the market showed increasing weakness. Today, "Flower Bird" brand Australian flour opened at $28.67, dropping to $28.45. "Golden Dragon" brand Canadian flour fell to the $28 mark, down another 5 or 6 cents from the previous day. Flour from Chinese factories was sold at a discounted price of $25, with Fuxin distributing over 5,000 bags, the remainder being sold with foreign flour as a bundle.</p>
<p>The wheat market was exceptionally calm yesterday. This was because the amount of domestically produced wheat in storage was very low, and the market had long been lacking supply. Therefore, factories were no longer actively searching the market for raw materials, with only Japanese stores occasionally making purchases. The market was also easing due to the decline in flour prices.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Corn Ultimately Fails to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions in grains, oils, soybean cakes all decreased in volume, with prices mostly hovering around a small range. The reason was that sales at shops remained weak, and people's minds were uneasy. Furthermore, the market was closed today as usual (Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar) and Monday was Sunday, resulting in two consecutive days without trading. Therefore, the underlying trend was listless, and corn in particular was affected by the seasonal factors, with sellers eager to sell. The market price declined. How it previously rose is how it is now falling; this had long been anticipated. In short, "live in soy sauce, die in soy sauce" has proven to be true. Yesterday, the lowest price for Westside corn stored in warehouses opened at $30.06, while corn stored outside the warehouse was $30. April deliveries were at $63.50, and late March to early April deliveries were at $3.50. Dutch white corn was $32, yellow corn was $33, and spot goods from Inghua Company were $33.20. April deliveries were $62, and late March to early April deliveries were $62.50. A total of ten carloads of spot goods and twelve or thirteen carloads of futures were traded. Today, 2,240 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates remain unchanged. The unofficial markets for British and American exchange were very quiet, with almost no fluctuations. Speculators continued to short sell May US dollar futures by four or five hundred thousand, but HSBC and other foreign banks had the capacity to absorb these sales, so the closing rate for spot British pounds was slightly higher than the previous day at 3/234375, while the US dollar remained unchanged at $5.3125. The trend in futures was similar.</p>
<p>Speculation Still Present</p>
<p>In the early morning, with London bars flat and New York silver prices and London gold prices stable, exchange rates for British and American currency showed no movement. Central Bank listed rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices at 3/234375 for British pounds and $5.3125 for US dollars, with the British pound slightly higher than the previous day by .015625, while the US dollar remained flat. After the opening, HSBC bought slightly, purchasing May US dollars at $5.3125 from other banks. If one were to settle contracts for the current month and May US dollars at that time, it would cost $5.28125. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also flat. Afterwards, speculators came to short sell 400,000 US dollar of May futures, priced at $5.3125, which were absorbed by some American banks. It was heard that Chinese banks were also conducting counter trades, but the market lacked volatility. At noon, May US dollars could be settled at $5.3125. At the close, both spot and current month British pounds were quoted at 3/234375, spot and current month US dollars were $5.3125, and May US dollars were $5.28125.</p>
<p>Slightly Higher British Pound, Flat US Dollar</p>
<p>Later in the market, speculators made a few settlements. A small volume of April US dollar contracts were traded at $5.3125. Afterwards, there was little trading activity. At the close, British pounds remained at 3/234375, US dollars at $5.3125, May British pounds at 3/21875, and May US dollars at $5.28125. As a result, the spot British pound was slightly higher than the previous day by 0.015625, while the US dollar showed no change.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Steady</p>
<p>Hong Kong, April 4 (Friday) Telegram: This morning, the exchange market opened steady.

<p>Tianjin: British and American Currencies Both Declined</p>
<p>Tianjin, April 4 (Friday) Telegram: The exchange market opened soft this morning. London telegraphic transfers decreased by .03125 to 3 pence 3125.

<h3>Gold Market Lacks Momentum, Selling Occurs at Highs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for refined gold saw mixed price movements, with only slight fluctuations. Initially, the British exchange rate was slightly higher, and market sentiment was good. The price briefly rose to $6,555, but then fell to $6,522 due to profit-taking. Afterwards, the market became even calmer. Although Xinfeng, Yongtong, Kangyong, and others continued to settle contracts, Hesheng and Hengji were also keen to cover short positions. Furthermore, Li Tai acted as an agent for a certain client to increase long positions. As a result, the closing price was still at $6,538, up $6 from the previous settlement. Approximately 17,000 to 18,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The spot market was initially firm but later weakened. Initially, Xintianbao absorbed 90 taels from Tianyuan, and Chengji 10 taels, at a premium of $200. At the same time, Chengji sold 10 taels to Fengxiang Heji, at a premium of $200. In the afternoon, due to a lack of demand for physical goods, the price was $30 lower than the previous high. It was heard that a certain silver shop sold 50 taels to Defu, at a premium of $170.</p>
<p>Slight Increase of Six Dollars for the Day</p>
<p>In the early morning, the market opened at $6,500 per bar (ten taels), and market sentiment was good. There were purchases at the listed price (opening price), pushing the price up by $18 to $6,550. Soon, Yidachengji sold off, bringing the price down to $6,538. However, Dada, Xianghe, Xinfeng, Yongtian, and others were continuously absorbing supply, pushing the price back up to $6,555. Afterwards, Xinfeng Yong stopped buying and started selling. Dafeng, Yifeng, Defu, Tongkangyong, Decheng, and others followed suit, and the exchange rate futures market hardened slightly, causing buyers to hesitate. The price gradually fell to $6,522. At noon, Chengji, Hengji, and retail investors covered short positions, slightly shifting market sentiment, and the price recovered to $6,532. The afternoon session opened at $6,536. Yida sold off in small quantities, but soon Hesheng strongly absorbed supply to cover short positions (acting as agent for Xinfeng Foreign Company). In addition, Dada and retail investors also bought, pushing the price up to $6,545. At that time, Xianghe took profits, and Xinfeng Yong also liquidated their long positions. Although Li Tai acted as an agent for a certain client to aggressively increase long positions, totaling 1,200 to 1,300 taels, demand could not keep up with supply, and the price was pushed down to $6,525. Later, Xinyuan bought aggressively, pushing the price back up to $6,540. The closing price was $6,538, resulting in an increase of $6 from the previous settlement. There was no activity in the spot market for cash shops' own-brand gold and spot standard gold.</p>

Both Japanese and Korean gold notes trended lower, with the former falling to $1.97 and the latter falling to $1.61.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Prospects Clear</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market showed a rebound yesterday. It was firm in the morning, and in the afternoon news suddenly spread that a new US loan of $250 million had been successfully obtained. This was the first signal that the economic aid to China after Corley's return was about to happen. Although it had not yet materialized, it was possible. As a result, the pessimistic sentiment in the market was suddenly lifted, and the trend and prospects became clearer and more promising. Yesterday morning, Lianhe, Xie Da, Datong, Kangxin, Fuxin, and Shunchang all made purchases. However, Yuxing sold a large number of E-type bonds, while Hengkang, Renchang, Renfeng, Yongfu, and others liquidated their long positions. Therefore, the closing prices at noon were mixed. The afternoon session opened quietly, but then became bullish, with Lianyi showing extremely strong buying interest, purchasing about 300,000 to 400,000 units of A-type bonds. Xiexing Yuan purchased about 300,000 units of B and C-type bonds. Dechang, Gongmao, Xinfu, Hefeng, and Tongji also made purchases. Renfeng and Renchang sold about 400,000 units.

<p>Type | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Bearing Three Days of Risk, Yarn Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained unchanged, increasingly sluggish. This was because the actual situation showed little progress. Buyers from Hong Kong were limited, and other buyers were affected by the blockade, and their business was declining daily. Therefore, buyers' interest was weak, but raw cotton prices remained high, making it unsuitable to sell off. Therefore, everyone maintained a wait-and-see approach. Once a signal appeared, they would then take action, either buying or selling, and determining their strategy. However, some were selling "Double Horse" brand and switching to "Angel" and "Earth" brands. This was the reason for the recent firm prices of miscellaneous yarn brands. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" was $1,394, and the low price was $1,388. In the afternoon, due to the Qingming Festival tomorrow and the market being closed, there was three days of risk, and most were unwilling to take action. There were no transactions, and the asking price was around $1,393 or $1,394. Today, 1,850 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"Double Horse" brand opened very peacefully, with the opening price at $1,392 or $1,393. Trading on the floor was not brisk. Shortly after, it rose slightly to $1,394, but buyers were scattered and lacked energy. The price hovered around this level for a long time. It was also heard that the exchange rate was quiet. Speculators said, "There's nothing to do," and their spirits were low. The market was easing, falling to $1,288. By the time the market closed, someone bought a few bales of 20-count "Angel" and "Earth" brands at higher prices, recovering slightly to close at $1,391. A statistical summary of half-day trading shows the following volumes purchased by each group:</p>
<p>Hong Kong/Ningbo: 40; Mainland: 120</p>
<p>Ningbo: 10; Traders: 4,330</p>
<p>Total: 4,500</p>
<h3>Inability to Sell Cotton Yarn at a Good Price Leads to a Surge in Cotton Purchases; Indian Cotton Market Falls as East African Cotton Wins; Shanghai Market Sees Stronger Demand for Long-Staple Wool-Like US Cotton</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation has become more active, with Shenxin and Yuxin factories increasing their purchases. However, the purchase intentions of the Yongan factory are not strong. As US cotton prices rise steadily, market sentiment is good, and "skin ball" transactions among traders are extremely active. Interest in cotton among the general public is increasing daily. The general opinion is that cotton inventories are low and the outlook for foreign cotton is bullish, while cotton yarn is overstocked and has limited outlets, so shifting capital from yarn to cotton to make profits is the way to go. Unfortunately, factories' enthusiasm for absorption is declining due to the inability to sell yarn at a good price and weak profits. As a result, the upward pressure is slow.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was strong and advanced in the early morning due to purchases by traders and Washington, but subsequently fell slightly due to profit-taking. As a result, closing prices rose by 10 to 16 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell because cotton merchants were short selling imported Sudanese and Egyptian cotton, then recovered due to buyer support. But most importantly, the market fell again due to the British victory in the African war, which would lead to a large amount of African cotton such as Egyptian and Sudanese cotton being imported. Yesterday's closing prices fell by 1 to 3 rupees. Forecasts predict that today's opening will rise slightly by 1.5 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has seen factory and trader competition due to over 4,000 bales of Brazilian cotton arriving at the end of last month, and the market has been surging. The demand for long-staple wool-like US cotton of fine-count raw material is particularly strong. It is expected that as the situation in all regions is favorable, there will be a more active cotton market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Large Quantities of Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market continued to be firm yesterday. Transactions among traders and actual demand in the local market remained active. However, only the Cantonese and Hong Kong buyers can get through, and their purchases were the most enthusiastic. Today, 2,160 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong. White goods from the sales disk, such as Dapeng fine cloth, continued to be sought after by Jinghua, Huafeng and other factories, rising by 5 jiao alone. Other grades of fine cloth and twill were inferior, with flat opening prices. Yihe's grades of coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, but were still cheaper than the market price. Dark-colored fine yarn fabrics, melton, and serge rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in the local market. Cantonese and Hong Kong buyers purchased more than 300 pieces of goods such as Sanyang serge, Huafeng blue cloth, and Daxin-colored twill.</p>
<p>The Dongbu (Eastern Cloth) market was stable. White goods rose slightly due to weak actual sales, but the increases quickly failed, with little change. The highest selling price for Longtou fine cloth was $49.75, the lowest was $49.50, and the closing transaction price was $49.60. The price of Sijunzi serge continued to rise by 5 li, to $1.45.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Ease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, after several days of large price increases, had gradually built up inventories, and many were inclined to sell, so prices continued to ease. The association's quoted prices for spot goods were: $87.95 to $87.50 for 24-grade coarse white sugar stored outside the warehouse, down 8 jiao. Futures for April 10 delivery were initially firm, at $89 to $88.50, but then eased to $88.20, $87.80, and $87.60, down about one yuan. Futures for April 20 delivery opened at $90, then went to $89.50, $89, and $88.60, down 9 jiao. Dutch red sugar was $68.50, small triangle. Taikoo granulated sugar B mark was $89.60 and $89.50, unchanged. DY mark was $84, small four corners. HX mark was $83.20, small two corners. Yesterday, 24,000 bags of sugar arrived from the Netherlands.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branch Market Sees Rise</h3>
<p>Due to gradually decreasing stocks of orchid bamboo branches, the market trend has slightly shifted lower. Listed prices have risen by $5, and market prices have also increased accordingly. However, the sales of black leaf branches remain weak. Although the stock is scarce, it remains sluggish.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shrimp Roe Sees Both Scarcity of Arrivals and Sales</h3>
<p>The arrival of shrimp roe has been scarce recently, but sales from all regions are also sluggish, so the market trend is very calm. The price of "Chaobian" tail is relatively high, currently selling for $650, "Tianbian" tail is $430, and "Yuan Dong" tail is $450.</p>
<h3>Coal: Tongdeli White Coal Increases Rapidly</h3>
<p>The market for Tongdeli white coal is booming, and the price of the goods continues to rise. Because customer demand continues to be strong, and traders' stocks are gradually depleted, market participants are holding back from selling, and the unofficial price is increasing rapidly. Yesterday, Tongdeli No. 1 and No. 2 lump coal was quoted at $380, for old orders, warehouse rent is excluded. The prices of the shops in this street also rose in unison with the tide.</p>
<h3>Metals: Huisi Iron Sales in This Street are Very Active</h3>
<p>Two hundred-pound Huisi iron from the new and old steel mills, because there is not much circulating goods in the market, and the overseas sources of supply is cut off, so this street's can factories, toy factories, printing factories, biscuit factories, and traders unloading are all very active. The number of transactions every day is often over a hundred boxes. The market participants holding goods are energetic, and the market is rising with prices tightening. The price is about 30-40 points higher than before, and now selling about $400 per box. The price increase of small strip iron, blue lead double-connected boards, and blue lead Huisi iron, are also alarming. Previously, the market price of plain white iron sheets once dropped to $15-16 per sheet due to hoarders selling off, but yesterday, because of slight movements in customer demand and factory sales, the price rose again, with a asking price of $21-22 per sheet.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Number of Directors Must Go Through Legal Procedures; The Consular Body Will Be Notified After the General Meeting, and Then Reported to the Governments of Various Countries for Approval</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 4th), an official told a Western newspaper reporter that there might be some difficulties in seeking approval from the countries that signed treaties with China and the Chinese government for the proposed change in the number of directors of the Municipal Council, but this would ultimately have no impact on the Municipal Council. It is reported that the change in the number of directors will seek the approval of the entire consular body, not the approval of individual consuls. All twelve consuls of the consular body, except for Japan, recognize the Chongqing government as the legitimate government of China.</p>
<p>Too Early to Make a Final Decision</p>
<p>The official also confirmed that the Consuls General of Britain, the United States, and Japan are currently drafting a proposal to change the number of directors, which will be presented as a resolution at the special taxpayers' meeting on April 17. It is said that if the taxpayers of the Public Concession approve this change, the leader of the consular body will be notified, and then a report will be submitted to the senior representatives of the countries that signed treaties with China and the Chongqing government. When asked if the change in the number of directors could be approved, the official replied that it was too early to tell and that there might be unexpected developments, so it was impossible to say for sure.</p>
<p>The Question of Additional Directors</p>
<p>At the same time, all sectors of the city are still discussing the results of this year's Municipal Council election. In addition to the Chinese, British, American, and Japanese directors, there is a possibility of adding directors of other nationalities. The expatriate groups with fewer residents in Shanghai have already selected their ideal candidates for additional directors. However, except for the American expatriates who recommended two candidates in February, other expatriates have not yet definitively determined candidates.</p>
<p>The Russian Expatriate Association Engages in the Election</p>
<p>The Russian Expatriate Association of this city held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss a proposal to be submitted to the consular body, requesting the addition of a Russian director to the Municipal Council. Yesterday morning, various Russian-language newspapers reported on this proposal with great fanfare, advocating for the achievement of their goal. The reason they gave was that there are a large number of Russian expatriates in Shanghai, and the property and interests they own are also increasing daily, so they demand that they should have one or two director seats in the Municipal Council. The Russian expatriates admit that the White Russians in Shanghai do not have a consul, so there will be difficulties in the election. However, we believe that most of the Russian expatriates reside in the French Concession and claim that the interests of the Russian expatriates in the Public Concession are greater than those of other expatriates who currently do not have a director seat in the Municipal Council. According to Ivanov, the chairman of the Russian Expatriate Association, the Russian expatriates in this city are currently electing a candidate to participate in the election of "other nationality" directors of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Citywide Rice Stockpile of 1.6 Million Bags</h3>
<p>The Rice Industry Association's 105th survey of rice stocks in Chinese and foreign warehouses (from last Thursday to this Thursday) has been completed. The citywide (including Pudong, Hongkou, and the central district) total reached 849,197 bags in more than 60 rice warehouses, an increase of 7,922 bags from the previous period. Roosevelt had the most, with 73,741 bags. The number of rice door-to-door sales and residents hoarding is estimated to reach more than 600,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of rice stored in the city is still more than 1.6 million bags. Assuming a daily consumption of 10,000 bags, the rice stock is sufficient for the city's 4 million Chinese and foreign residents for six months.</p>
<p>Impersonating Detectives Extort Rice Shops</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the first of this month at 3 PM, Yin Yuzhang, who impersonated a detective from the Political Department of the Public Concession, suddenly arrived at the Yucheng Rice Shop at 299 Guangxi Road, claiming that the Saigon rice sold by the shop exceeded the price limit, and then extorted 100 yuan of national currency. Afterwards, Mao Guodou, a detective from the Political Department, learned of the incident and went to the shop to investigate with detectives Li Haifeng and Li Bijun. The facts were verified, and they immediately found out Yin Yuzhang's formal address. On the morning of the 3rd, they lured him to the corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road and arrested him. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, he was sent to the court by the Central Police Station for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Pihan Shelter Closing at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Yan Family Residence Pihan Shelter of the Cilian Association, which houses more than 1,000 impoverished people, is scheduled to close at the end of this month. The impoverished people in the shelter have made hundreds of mops and hundreds of straw sandals, which are urgently waiting to be sold. If anyone needs them, they can contact the association's office at 35 Yunnan Road, Renji Shantang.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Eager for Residents to Reduce Electricity Consumption; Special Electricity Restriction Committee Has Been Formed; Diesel Shortage at Power Company, Difficulties</h3>
<p>Regarding the three fundamental principles of reducing electricity consumption in the French Concession, which were mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, it is learned that the French Concession authorities have formed a special Electricity Restriction Committee, whose members are as follows:</p>
<p>(Chairman) French Consul Dufour</p>
<p>(Committee Members) Bai Yi, Director of the Municipal Council; Pu Gong, Chief Engineer of the Municipal Council; Sa Li, Deputy Director of the Police Department; Favreli, Manager of the French Water and Electricity Company; Xu Le, Zhao Zhiyou, Laban'er, Sang Qie.</p>
<p>The committee recently held a meeting at the Municipal Council. At the meeting, Favreli, the manager of the water and electricity company, reported on the difficulties the company was facing, saying that the company needed 2,100 tons of diesel per month, but the oil company only agreed to supply 1,500 tons per month in March and April, and the quantity to be supplied in the future could not be guaranteed. The water and electricity company currently has 5,200 tons of oil in stock, which is only enough for March. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a practical electricity reduction plan, which will be implemented according to the urgency. The biggest electricity consumers in the concession are the factories, but industry has a great impact on social problems, so the amount used will be protected as much as possible within the possible range. Electricity consumption for electric heating, road signs, neon lights, etc. must be saved. Residents should also understand the company's situation and voluntarily reduce their electricity consumption to overcome the difficulties. It is heard that the Electricity Restriction Committee is scheduled to hold another meeting next Thursday.</p>
<p>The current monthly electricity consumption in the French Concession is as follows:</p>
<p>Residents 2,656,000 KWH</p>
<p>Factories 3,088,600 KWH</p>
<p>Electric Heating 385,000 KWH</p>
<p>National Tomb Sweeping Day</p>
<h3>Solemn Silent Tribute: Remembering the Heroic Souls Who Defended the Nation</h3>
<p>Today is National Tomb Sweeping Day (also known as the abolished lunar Qingming Festival). The government previously issued an explicit order to commemorate ancestors and martyrs on this date. People from all walks of life in this city, with resolute and solemn spirits, are preparing to go to various public cemeteries in the concessions to pay respects to deceased family members. They will also uniformly insert willow branches and hang peach charms to summon the heroic souls who were loyal and defended the nation. Originally, it was planned to go to the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes in Miaohang and the Tomb of Martyrs Mengzhou in Jiangwan for commemoration, but due to the special circumstances, it was decided to suspend the activity as usual. Instead, a solemn silent tribute will be held for the fallen soldiers who fought to resist the Japanese and defend the nation. We vow to inherit the unfinished legacy of the martyrs, to move forward in unity in our respective national duties, and strive for the final victory of the nation.</p>
<p>Slaughterhouse Pig Butchers Strike: A Sudden Labor Dispute; Union Collects Pig Bristles; Union Directors Oppose and Get Beaten</p>
<p>There are over sixty slaughterhouses in the French Concession of this city, divided into Jiangyin, Suzhou, and local groups, employing over two hundred pig butchers. Recently, Chen Jinhai, a director of the industry association, opposed the union's collection of pig bristles for three days as union funds (previously, the pig bristles belonged to both labor and management). This caused dissatisfaction among the workers. On the afternoon of the 3rd, at 8:45 PM, as Chen was going from his home to the company office, he was ambushed by over twenty workers at the entrance of the company on Min Ti Ni Yin Road and severely beaten. Police officers arrived and arrested two workers involved in the incident and detained them at the police station. An ambulance was called to take Chen to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The police also filed charges yesterday. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon (the 4th), the workers suddenly went on strike, causing the slaughterhouse operations to come to a complete halt. The workers suddenly announced the strike without stating any reasons before or after the event. It is only known that the purpose of this strike is to demand that the police release the two arrested workers.</p>
<p>Tailor Strike: Resolution Reached</p>
<p>Hundreds of garment workers in Western-style clothing stores on Xiafei Road, Hubei Road, Sichuan Road, and other areas, noting that the price of rice in the city has exceeded one hundred yuan (according to the labor-management agreement signed on October 28th of last year, if the price of Xian rice (No. 2) exceeds one hundred yuan, wages would be adjusted), demanded that management improve their compensation. Due to significant differences in opinion between the two sides, a strike was implemented starting on the 28th. It is now known that the strike was resolved the night before last through mediation by the Public Concession 工部局 Political Department. Except for Xiafei Road, where the management representative was absent, labor and management in Hubei Road, Sichuan Road, and other areas have agreed to sign an agreement with the following measures: (1) Wage increases will be as follows: (A) Those with current wages of four yuan or less will receive a 40% increase. (B) Those with current wages of eight yuan or less will receive a 34% increase. (C) Those with current wages above eight yuan will uniformly receive a 30% increase. (D) Long-term tailors will receive a 32% increase based on their current wages. (2) The above rates are for long robes. Other wages for summer clothing, overcoats, vests, and outwork foremen will be increased according to the same percentage as the long robes. For example, if the wage for long robes is increased by 30%, all other wages will also be increased by 30%. (3) This agreement will be adjusted again when the price of rice (No. 2 Xian rice) rises to 150 yuan, with a further 20% increase based on the new wage. Subsequently, for every 50 yuan increase in the price of rice, there will be another 20% increase based on the new wage. For example, if the current wage is six yuan, an additional 2.04 yuan will be added. If the price of rice exceeds 150 yuan, an additional 1.608 yuan will be added, for a total of 9.648 yuan. This will continue proportionally.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Demands: Two Proposed Solutions</p>
<p>Due to rising prices, postal workers in this city have twice requested a raise from the Bureau chief. The bureau has now telegraphed the headquarters to request a response within three days. It is reported that the postal workers have proposed two solutions for the pay increase: First, the Postal Workers' Union is requesting a raise of 100 yuan per person. Second, the Postal Employees' Union is requesting a 250% increase for those with monthly salaries below 100 yuan, a 200% increase for those with monthly salaries between 100 and 200 yuan, and a 150% increase for those with salaries above 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Some Scale Shops Have Resumed Work</p>
<p>There are over forty weighing instrument businesses (i.e., scale shops). The employees, feeling that their salaries were too low, requested a 60% increase in wages from the shop owners, which was not accepted, and they went on strike. It is learned that over thirty businesses have accepted the employees' requests and have moderately increased their wages. However, over ten businesses have not accepted the requests and are currently closed.</p>
<p>Shoe Workers Strike and Cause Disturbances</p>
<p>Since the 1st of this month, due to soaring costs and increased prices, the shoe industry's labor force, feeling that the 20% allowance and 20% rice subsidy increased in January of this year were insufficient to maintain their livelihood, requested management on the 1st of this month to further increase the allowance. This request was not met, and some shoe store workers began a strike on the 2nd. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, thirty striking workers went to shoe stores in the Xin Zha District that were still open and demanded that the workers join the strike. After hearing this, the police, fearing it would disrupt public order, arrested thirteen of the striking workers.</p>

<h3>Authorities Propose Remedies for Unequal Taxation: Subcommittee Prepares Report to be Submitted to the Annual Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting for Discussion</h3>
<p>The 工部局 previously established a subcommittee to study the inequalities of the tax system and to propose remedial measures. The initial members of the committee were F. Cranston, J. Johns, Sun Ruihuang, Mei Han, and Okamoto. Later, E. Ising, a representative of the Property Owners' Association, was added as a member. The discussions have now been completed, and two reports have been submitted. One report was agreed upon by five members, and the other was submitted independently by Mr. Ising. Both reports were submitted for discussion at a special meeting of the 工部局 Board of Directors yesterday (the 4th). As a result, it was decided to submit the former report to this year's Annual Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting for discussion. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>Inequalities in House Tax: It has been found that the house tax paid by lessees of properties in the Public Concession and the so-called "outside road area" has been based primarily on the actual rent paid in the past and present. On the other hand, the house tax paid by owner-occupiers of properties is based on the 工部局's valuation. This valuation is theoretically determined by referring to the rent paid by tenants for similar properties. When there is a change in rental value, the assessed value of owner-occupied properties must be adjusted sooner or later to match the change in rental value.</p>
<p>The 工部局's current tax system has been considered fair to all taxpayers. If the situation in this city were the same as in the past, there would be no shortcomings in this tax system. However, since the Battle of Shanghai, the situation has been abnormal, causing the previously satisfactory tax system to become unequal, and remedies should be found immediately. This inequality can be roughly divided into (1) inequality among property lessees, (2) inequality between property lessees and owner-occupiers, and (3) inequality arising from the mixed calculation of taxes.</p>
<p>Protected and Unprotected: Regarding the first point, in order to thoroughly study the inequality among property lessees, tenants should first be divided into two categories: protected tenants and unprotected tenants. A "protected tenant" is one who is protected by Chinese civil law and cannot be evicted or have their rent increased without a court ruling. In addition, tenants who have long-term lease agreements are similarly protected. According to the provisions of Chinese civil law, as interpreted by Chinese courts, for leases calculated on a monthly basis or without a lease agreement, the landlord may not order them to move unless they intend to take back the property for their own use or demolish and rebuild it. Furthermore, they may not increase the rent without a court ruling. Therefore, since 1937, it has been very difficult for landlords to obtain permission to increase rents, and even those who have been approved have been limited to an increase of 20% or less. According to accurate estimates, protected tenants account for approximately 80% of all tenants in Shanghai. As for the general unprotected tenants, they are not subject to Chinese law and did not have long-term lease agreements before the war.</p>
<p>Because tenants enjoy the benefits of protection, their rent either remains the same as before the war or has increased by only 20%. On the other hand, general unprotected tenants have no choice but to obey the landlord's wishes, and as a result, their house tax is based on frequently increasing rents. However, the house tax paid by protected tenants is still based on pre-war rent or limited increases.</p>
<p>Different Market Conditions Before and After the War: Although Chinese civil law is not newly promulgated, the tax system was already feeling somewhat unequal during the period before the war in 1937. The reason for this is that there was an open market for leased properties before the war, and rents had a normal and natural level. For example, in the spring of 1937, if a landlord intended to increase the rent and the tenant considered the increase unreasonable, the tenant could move to another property. At that time, the situation for protected tenants was not as good as it is today. From 1934 to 1935, rents tended to fall, and by the spring of 1937, they had not fully recovered to the levels of 1933. After the Battle of Shanghai, Shanghai and its suburbs suffered widespread devastation, resulting in overcrowding in the concessions and their jurisdictional areas. Thus, the situation changed, and it became difficult for unprotected tenants to find better accommodation due to rent increases. The open market for properties disappeared, and the disparity in the amount of rent paid by the two types of tenants became increasingly severe, resulting in unequal tax payments.</p>
<p>Reassessment Not Yet Completed: Under the 工部局's current tax system, the house tax paid by the two types of tenants will inevitably be unequal due to rising or falling rents. Recognizing this, the 工部局 established a reassessment committee at the beginning of last year to revalue owner-occupied properties. For owner-occupied commercial and industrial buildings, the valuation as of June 30, 1937, was used to determine the current value, and then an additional 20% was added for tax purposes. The additional 10% was considered to be the average increase in rent since 1937. At the same time, the Tax Bureau also revalued the value of owner-occupied residential buildings based on the above standards.</p>
<p>Although the committee worked hard to speed up the work, it was unable to complete the reassessment of all owner-occupied houses by the end of last year. Since January of this year, house tax has been levied on those houses that have been reassessed based on their newly estimated value. All houses that have not been reassessed will wait for reassessment. This measure will reduce the inequality between rented houses and owner-occupied houses that have already been reassessed. However, on the other hand, it will create inequality between owner-occupied houses that have been reassessed and those that have not been reassessed. The committee's valuation work is expected to be completed this autumn, and the latter inequality mentioned above may not be completely eliminated before this autumn. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Happy Children's Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Children's Day, and children all over the city were excited and celebrated the holiday. School teachers and parents led the children to parks for outings. The Sino-German Hospital also held a children's health competition, which was unprecedented. (Top picture) Children at the Sino-German Hospital perform a human pyramid. (Photo by Wang Juerong) (Bottom picture) A glimpse of the children's sports meeting at the Gujiazhai Park in the submarine sector. A group of innocent and lively children are playing on seesaws.

<h3>Children's Day Outing</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Children's Day is a day of liberation for children, and they should be allowed to play and have fun. The older children went to the Dumi Theater in groups with their schools in the morning to watch a movie. In the afternoon, I decided to take them to the park for an outing. I think it's so silly for children to be led by their teachers to play in the park! It's really too much trouble for teachers to take care of children, and children can't play as they please because they are restricted by the group. When I saw several children who had lost their groups crying in confusion because they couldn't find their companions and teachers, I thought about how distressed their teachers would be to lose a child!</p>
<p>Because the French Park is very close to home, the children usually go there to play by themselves, so I decided to go to a park that was farther away so they could feel like they were on a trip.</p>
<p>We set off at 1:30 PM after lunch. After waiting for four buses, we finally squeezed onto the fifth bus. We got off at the outer end of Avenue Edward VII. The older child asked me what the bronze statue standing at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII was. I told him that it was the Peace Memorial Tower of the First World War. The winged female figure is called the Goddess of Peace, but the Goddess of Peace did not deter those crazy invaders, and now the whole world is at war again!</p>
<p>Walking along the Huangpu River, we unknowingly reached the Bund Park. The younger child was very interested in the big and small boats in the Huangpu River. He loved the white speedboat that was speeding through the waves. Maybe he thought it was the toy speedboat he played with in a basin full of water.</p>
<p>When we entered the Bund Park, there were not many visitors. The grass all showed a haggard and withered color. A large area of grass along the mouth of the Suzhou River was prohibited from being trampled on. Except for some green trees and flowers along the road, half of the park was desolate and lifeless. We sat on a bench along the river for a while. The old clock at the Customs House was striking two, and the new clock should be three o'clock, so we decided to leave and go to Zhaofeng Garden.</p>
<p>In front of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road, we boarded the front row of the upper level of Bus Route 1, and Jidong sent us to the far west of Zhaofeng Garden. In front of the park gate, there were slogans "Benefit the Country and Benefit the People," and tourists and vendors were playing a noisy metropolitan melody.</p>
<p>As soon as we walked in, the park was full of groups of people. The children were like small birds out of their cages, rushing to the grass. We sat on the grass and ate the snacks we brought, and then strolled around as we pleased.</p>
<p>Groups of children were led by their teachers and played various games on the grass, or chased each other under the bushes. Rubber balls fell and rose in the air like shooting stars, small sails floated in the river, and small fish and tadpoles were caught by the pond. The whole park was a world of children.</p>
<p>We walked towards the east, crossed the small bridge over the pond, and walked among the trees on the earthen mound. Sometimes we ran, sometimes we walked slowly, crossed the vast and flat green grass, and went deep into the woods in the northwest corner, turning and winding until we reached a place where various flowers and plants were planted. There were flowers of various colors, light brown maple leaves, and pear blossoms like a sea of snow, and our eyes were full of bright colors. It was as if we had become the four characters in "The Wizard of Oz." Let nine-year-old Ming'er play Dorothy, six-year-old Lin'er, who is brave but not able to think, can be called the Scarecrow, fourteen-year-old Zhong'er, who has a relatively mild temperament but doesn't seem to have a good memory, can temporarily play the Tin Man, and then I should play this docile Lion. We don't need to find the old doctor in the Emerald City.</p>
<p>We were quite tired from walking, so we rested in the shade of the trees, and then passed the tall earthen mound planted with flowers on the west side and arrived at the ancestral temple with the yellow walls. We saw two enchanting women taking pictures of a man by the wall with the dragon painted on the back door, making strange movements. I couldn't bear to look at it again, so I walked straight to the front door, took a deep breath on the thick and soft grass under the tree, and walked out of the park gate.</p>
<h3>Preventing Car Horn Noise: Promotion Week to be Held Next Month; Late-Night Disturbances Extremely Annoying; Police Department Decides to Adopt Adjustment Methods</h3>
<p>There are many cars in this city, and the sound of their horns is endless on the streets. It is not very annoying during the day, but at night, the sound is deafening, disturbing people's sleep. Especially in summer, when citizens often sleep with their windows open, they are startled awake by the sudden sound of horns, which is very distressing.</p>
<p>Anti-Horn Noise Disturbance Campaign: Recognizing this, the 工部局 Police Department will cooperate with the French Concession Police Department in May to launch a campaign to prevent horn noise disturbance, following the "Safety First" campaign, which has been quite successful. It will last for one week. If the desired results are achieved, then people will be able to sleep at night without being disturbed by the sound of horns.</p>
<p>Cooperation and Extensive Promotion: In order to extensively launch this campaign, the Public Concession police authorities will cooperate with other relevant authorities in the city. During the promotion week, extensive publicity will be used to urge car owners, drivers, and visiting car drivers to help eliminate the horn noise that disturbs good dreams. In this new campaign, the methods of promoting the "Safety First" campaign will be followed, using radio, leaflets, banners, and speeches for publicity.</p>
<p>Practical Demonstration of Mechanical Devices: In previous years, the police authorities have warned against honking car horns unnecessarily, but it has had little effect. Therefore, it is hoped that mechanical devices will be demonstrated in this campaign to reduce the sound of horns to a minimum. It is heard that the Police Department will adjust the sound waves of horns for private cars and taxis free of charge in order to promote the use of sound-reducing devices. A certain police officer from the Police Department Traffic Department yesterday demonstrated to reporters the method of using this device to reduce the sound of horns.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Mr. Zhu Ziqiao: Raising a Permanent Fund</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: I have just returned from another city. A friend told me that your newspaper published a news item on the first of this month about counterfeit Black Man Toothpaste, which stated that Shen Shanchang of Shanghai Chemical Company, in collusion with the owner of Shanghai Tube Factory, manufactured inferior toothpaste. The part about me is obviously inconsistent with the facts. Fortunately, the original document is still there and can be reviewed. Moreover, my factory has been implicated for no reason and has filed an appeal against the fine. Right and wrong are subject to public judgment. It is difficult to accept misinformation that damages years of reputation. I hereby request that you correct the matter. Please investigate and handle it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Shen Zhaoji. April 4, Year 30.</p>

<h3>Beware of the Fifth Column</h3>
<p>— Wu Su</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a popular new term called "Fifth Column". Since Germany's great victory in Europe, the "Fifth Column" has become even more famous. Especially in the United States, the newspapers and magazines are always full of stories about the Fifth Column. The Fifth Column has almost made everyone panic.</p>
<p>In fact, the Fifth Column does not only exist internationally, nor only in military and political affairs; it can exist in you, in me, and in him, anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>What is your Fifth Column? Your bad habits are your First Column. Being lazy today, doing a few minutes less work; being presumptuous today, losing your temper a few more times, thinking a few more bad thoughts, lingering in bad environments for a while, doing one more thing that makes your conscience uneasy, it may seem to have nothing to do with it at first, but you have invisibly arranged the Fifth Column in your own character.</p>
<p>If you continue to perfunctorily like this, without paying attention to and correcting it, one day, your Fifth Column will intensify its destructive work on you. At that time, you will lose your job, you will get sick, you will fall into a state of being unable to save yourself; by then, it will be too late to regret.</p>
<p>So, you must beware of the Fifth Column!</p>

<h3>My Wild Children</h3>
<p>— A Friend of Wild Children</p>
<p>Wild children, somewhat annoying! Broken clothes, dirty hands and faces, rough movements, vulgar language; scabies, mange, worms covering the whole body. Children from noble families, stay away, it's terrible to get close. Not only will they adopt rough habits, but they will also spread malignant diseases. So parents warn their children not to approach the little rascals and not to play with wild children. This is correct. But can simply locking up your own children and not letting them come into contact with wild children guarantee that the wildness of wild children will not affect the children at home? Please look further: the villains today are mostly the wild children of the past, and the parents who can protect their children today are the children from home in the past; if there are more villains, will life be good? Will the country be decent? From this point of view, it is not enough to simply isolate your own children from wild children, unless all wild children are transformed into home children can you rest assured. Can wild children also be transformed into home children? It depends on the determination of the general public.</p>
<p>I have been friends with some wild children for two years, and I feel that their nature is not very annoying. The environment forces them to do all kinds of bad behaviors. After a long time, bad habits are hard to change, and it seems that their nature is inferior. I compare them to a piece of white cloth splashed with dirt. If you wait until it dries for a long time before washing it, it won't be clean for a while. People mistakenly think that it cannot be washed clean, so they just give up. However, if it can be washed with bleach after coating, you can bleach it as white as snow, no matter what color it is. If wild children are willing to undergo appropriate education, no matter how annoying they are, they can become lovable. Although I can't guarantee it as definitely as one plus one equals two, at least the experience of the past few years tells me so.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago I saw an anecdote about a general in a certain newspaper. The general once gave a speech to people, and the first sentence was: "China has me, and it will never perish." The audience was very surprised, how could he be so exaggerated, could he save China alone? Then the general said: "Everyone has a 'me', and 400 million people in China have 400 million 'me's. Is it not useful to gather 400 million 'me's?" Applause like thunder roared from the audience.</p>
<p>I dare not imitate the general's tone, and it is inevitable to be ridiculed for inappropriate analogy when applied to the issue of wild children. But if every adult can recognize the unattended wild children as "my children", treat wild children with the attitude of "my children", save wild children, and transform wild children, not only will wild children be able to escape the water and fire and ascend to the hall, but home children will also be able to avoid the crisis of being invaded in the future. Wise parents who love their children, please think twice.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is carrying out the work of rescuing wild children. The homeless children who have been educated in the orphanage have changed their appearance and jumped out of hell and into the human world. They love to read, are unwilling to work, are polite, and have spirit. All the ladies who have visited them nod and praise them, thinking that they are not waste, but children with a future, but the manpower and financial resources of the association are weak and cannot universally save them, so they have launched a campaign to solicit "Friends of Suffering Children". It is hoped that happy compatriots will actively participate and use the love of the public as their merciful boat. (The office of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is located at Room 419, 4th Floor, No. 169 Yuanmingyuan Road.)</p>

<h3>Father is Our Friend</h3>
<p>— Mo Zi</p>
<p>My father, in his fifties, has graying temples, but he has a young heart.</p>
<p>Like many people who cannot get rid of the constraints given to them by the environment, my father was born in a stubborn feudal family, and from then on developed a cautious and humble character. For more than fifty years, he has seen many changes in the world and experienced many vicissitudes, but he still has a conscience that has not gone along with the world, and exchanges his labor for living materials. Although my father sometimes does not agree with the world, he does not express an attitude of disgust towards them. He is still satisfied with his own land and lives his life optimistically.</p>
<p>People generally use strict to represent the attitude of fathers towards their children, but these two words are not suitable for us. Especially in recent years, my brother and I have gradually grown up and know more and more. We often talk and laugh arbitrarily, discuss world affairs, and criticize people. When he is happy, my father often says:</p>
<p>"We don't seem like father and son anymore, we are friends, haha we are friends."</p>
<p>My father has read many ancient books and classics, but he is also willing to accept new knowledge. Recently, he has read many books that are believed by young people of the era and are often criticized by the older generation or people with stubborn ideas. He read them and praised them. He would ask us about many new terms that he discovered. We would explain them in detail if we knew them. He was very happy to hear them and often said:</p>
<p>"Now you know more than me. In the past, young people followed the elderly, but now the elderly have to follow the young people."</p>
<p>Often many children grow up and become more and more estranged from their parents. But we are able to get extraordinarily close. While not forgetting the struggle for the future, we still maintain the warmth of the family. I often celebrate this happiness.</p>
<p>My father spent his entire middle age immersed in the muddy political tides of the past two decades. He neither got promoted nor got rich, but this did not make them regret it in the slightest. What he often regretted was not taking the opportunity to read more books when he was free, and the 5,000 books lost after the war. In the past two years, he has changed his career to teaching. The interest brought by the new profession did not make him think that teaching was a very hard job. Students like to attend his classes, saying that he often smiles and makes them happy. Once I asked one of her classmates, saying:</p>
<p>"You are happier in his class than other teachers, are you afraid of him?" Her answer was very thoughtful:</p>
<p>"Although there is no fear, there is always respect." I feel that the reason why we can have no gap with our father and will not be presumptuous, these two sentences are equally pertinent.</p>
<p>Speaking of our future, he hopes that we can be self-reliant, but does not blame us for rich support. He plans to return to his hometown in the future and live a simple and quiet life. I sometimes say to him:</p>
<p>"Father, you have been a good person for decades, and you still have a young heart. You can still do a vigorous job like young people, maybe you will achieve even greater things..." He often replaces his answer with a smile. , I don’t know if he agrees? Or show us to work hard.</p>
<p>Now, my father is sleeping peacefully after a day's work. Under the light, I looked at his kind face and white hair, and my heart was filled with gratitude. I can only repay him by working hard for my own future and wishing him eternal health and youth.</p>
<h3>Rice Eater</h3>
<p>— Written by Xiaoyue</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouqiao</p>
<p>(6) Love's Offspring</p>
<p>But at the time, Qiu Haitang did not think of this matter at all, so he did not deeply imprint Xiangqi's words in his mind.</p>
<p>A week later, he could no longer sit still in Beijing. After the three-day play agreed upon at Hualeyuan was over, he told Yuan Shaowen, Zhao Si, and others that Liu Yuhua had recently returned from the south and was sick at her home in Xianghe. He had received a telegram asking him to go there once, so he had to go out for three or four days. Others believed this lie, but he couldn't fool Rongkui; he thought that he and the Third Boss were almost always together. In these few days, he had never seen a telegram for him.</p>
<p>"There must be something going on here!" When he sent Qiu Haitang out the door, he couldn't help but think to himself.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang never expected that this kid would be so suspicious. When he got on the train, he couldn't wait to get to Tianjin immediately. However, the train was not made by him after all, nor was it opened for him alone. Before the scheduled time, he could only sit in the carriage and feel bored.</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask Yuan Shaowen when he also plans to go to Tianjin." While sitting bored, he realized that he had not taken this into account before he set off. But when he thought about it again, he felt relieved. First, he thought that no matter what day Lao Yuan set off from Beijing, Xiangqi should have some news there. Second, he thought that he would only be walking around in the Grain and Rice Street and would not go to Yuan's house, so they would never bump into each other.</p>
<p>But when he saw Xiangqi, he realized that some of his expectations were wrong.</p>
<p>"His temper is too strange. He never notifies me before coming." Xiangqi was still living at her home in Grain and Rice Street, just like seven or eight days ago. Therefore, Qiu Haitang did not need to go through the formalities of writing a letter to make an appointment and saw her immediately. After Qiu Haitang asked about Yuan Baofan's news, she frowned and said: "That's why I advised you in the second letter to come to Tianjin less often. Anyway, our hearts are forever tied together, what does it matter if our bodies are a little distant...!"</p>
<p>Xiangqi was still wearing a very simple cloth dress today, but her hair was adorned with a dark red chrysanthemum that was not yet fully bloomed, which seemed to add another touch of charm. (73)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>"Opopanax"</h3>
<p>— Mo Ye</p>
<p>This is a play adapted from the famous Russian work "Di Si Niang". In the tide of fashion films, it is significantly superior to those "Crying and Laughing Fate" type of films; although the development and formation of the theme is still inseparable from personal affairs of children, breaking free from the category of love.</p>
<p>The adaptation of "Opopanax" into Chinese, the spirit and mood of the whole play can maintain the original style; the division of scenes is also very concise, and even the transitional scenes do not feel how trivial, this is the brilliant stroke of the adapter. It can also grab the audience with danger and tension everywhere, which is where it succeeds.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are still many places worth discussing, such as the fact that it is not suitable for realistic China, the story renders such a strong coincidence, and the disconnection between the characters' personalities and real life. These can be said to have room for improvement.</p>
<p>The theme must be prominent in the subject matter, which is no different from the importance of studying hard. The theme of "Opopanax" is quite commendable, anti-warlord and evil forces grow, the whole play also exposes the darkness of warlord politics in many scenes, the innocent people are brutally killed, and the cruelty of the shameless is revealed to the audience at the beginning of the film. Then, Jin Dashuai's fierceness and the ugly faces of the adjutants are like a mirror, thoroughly shaping the image in front of the audience.</p>
<p>The director seems to be better than his previous work - "Xue Yan Niang". There is atmosphere, every scene is very tense, and it does not fall into slackness, this is his only successful place.</p>
<p>There is such a bad tendency in domestic films, the splicing of film is too sloppy, and even many directors cannot understand why it should be spliced. In fact, the stagnation of the lens is half due to the excessive length of the film, which distracts the audience's attention. "Opopanax" seems to have tried to correct this shortcoming, and the pace is very reasonable. Indeed, the scene of Luo Jing's private visit to Bai Lizhu, if played with a quiet melody, can increase the beauty of the mood, and it will also be of great help to the air.</p>
<p>Huang He's appearance in a formal young male role is still the first time on the screen. Undoubtedly, he still cannot wash away the excessive movements on the stage. Whether it is facial expression or inner expression, you can see that he is full of anger.</p>
<p>Ying Yin's most successful and most commendable place is the presentation of the characters' inner emotions. Yao Yu Chan is a person who has experienced a lot of hardships. She loves her cousin Luo Jing with all her heart, and wants to get some fun in life from this. When she knows that her sweetheart is in love with another person, and that person is her benefactor; for the sake of her lover and for the sake of repaying her kindness, the inner contradictions are intertwined, and she leans against the wall and tells her worries. This is a very valuable performance. The rest of the roles are mediocre, and Tu Guangqi has not made any progress.</p>
<h3>A Life of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>For the sake of struggle, you must sacrifice money, sacrifice happiness, sacrifice reputation, sacrifice energy, and even sacrifice your life. Whatever you have to sacrifice, sacrifice it. Ordinary people are willing to sacrifice money, happiness, reputation, and energy. When it comes to sacrificing their lives, they are reluctant. So many struggles fail.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in Qiongyuan</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Red Skirt Makes the Pomegranate Jealous</p>
<p>At this time, Li Zicheng and others had disturbed Henan, and disaster victims and green forests in various parts of Henan took the opportunity to respond, and it became a complete collapse, which could not be contained. Naturally, Qixian could not avoid being involved in the vortex. There were rumors everywhere, and there were several shocks in one night. Everyone said that the bandits on a certain mountain had joined forces with Li Zicheng, and would attack the county seat soon; some said that the bandits in a certain place would come to burn and loot the county seat, and had secretly sent many accomplices, disguised as hungry people, mixed into the city, and prepared to cooperate from within and without. Seeing that the situation was so serious, the magistrate of Qixian had to seek to stabilize people's hearts. First, he ordered more than 100 local garrison troops, led by Commander Ma, to be stationed on the slope outside the city, because that place was an important area that could resist the insurgents. He also felt that the city defense was insufficient, so he recruited strong men to help defend the city. Because he knew that Li Xin had a good reputation in the local area, had many followers, and the local people had great faith in him, he specially sent someone to invite Li Xin into the city to discuss important matters together. Li Xin believed that it was his duty to protect his hometown, so he agreed to the magistrate of Qixian to jointly defend the city. He immediately returned to his own manor, packed up, and sent his family members to live in the city; as for the manor, he had already instructed the servants to guard it, and gathered a dozen followers, preparing to go to the city immediately. He suddenly thought of Xu Jing, so he asked the servants to invite Xu Jing over for a talk. Since sending off Zhang Cangqiu, Chen Fei, and others, Xu Jing's heart was filled with the ambition to abandon his pen and join the army, and he had no more心思 to sit at his desk and read books. And his old mother had been feeling unwell for the past few days, sleeping half the day and getting up half the day, eating less and feeling tired. Although Xu Jing had invited a doctor to come and treat her, the medicine did not work. He was naturally a little upset in his heart, and when he heard the news of the unstable situation outside and the rumors of bandits attacking the city, he was even more uneasy, sitting in the study and murmuring to himself, helpless. Suddenly he saw someone from Li Jiazhuang come to invite him, so he followed the man to Li Jiazhuang and met Li Xin. Li Xin told him about this matter and asked Xu Jing to help him cooperate. Xu Jing naturally agreed. So he went back and asked Liu San to hire a small sedan chair to carry his mother to the city first, and live with Li Xin's people. Because when the bandits arrive, the outside of the city will inevitably be robbed first, while the city can still be defended. But he said this very vaguely in front of his mother, fearing that if he said it directly, his elderly mother would not be able to withstand the shock when she was sick. He also instructed Liu San to go with him to take good care of the old lady, and take several boxes and cages with him. (30)</p>

<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lingjie United Association is a very authoritative group of Pingju actors. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it has only set up a temporary office in the concession, specializing in charity work and serving its members. Recently, it has spawned two branches, the Small Group Association and the Wusheng Association.</p>
<p>The Small Group Association is an organization formed by general small characters in various opera troupes. The purpose is to seek business protection and progress, which is enough to enhance the power of the Linglian Association: The Wusheng Association was initiated by Liu Hanchen, Zhao Songqiao, Li Zhonglin, and Wang Xiaofang. A number of decisions were convened at Guanle Club. Their purpose is, of course, more narrowly defined, to seek happiness for the future of their industry. Unfortunately, this group does not have a sound organization, and the members who participate are also like scattered sand without unity. In the end, this Wusheng Congress quietly disappeared without a sound.</p>
