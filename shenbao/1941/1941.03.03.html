<h3 id="c8">法越再度被迫屈服以後 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>一度極形緊張的泰越糾紛，經維希政府於二十八日會議決定接受日方的「調解」建議；雖其條件尙未正式公布，最後結果亦有待於東京談判的進行，然大體無疑是法越的再度屈服。日前世人所憂盧着泰越間戰事的擴大，殆已不致實現，銳意索土的泰方，與以脅迫為調解的日本，對此都將感到躊躇滿意；只有法國和越南，於竭力支撑之餘，終以格於內外環境與種種困難，不能不繼去秋河內協定之後，使越南領土遭受割裂，再經歷着慘痛的一幕。身當其衝的法越當局，今茲之所遭遇，誠較去秋更為嚴重而複雜，但我人仍不勝為之惋惜其未能始終堅守其立塲，但此一問題之重要性，並不在泰越本身，而在於其與整個南太平洋局勢的關聯；今僅雙方領十爭執略獲解決，其未來演變尙在未定之天，昨論既已稍發端緒，茲請進進畢其所見。</p>
<p>所謂泰越領土糾紛，就其本質而論，初不過與七八年前南美玻巴兩邦間的大廈各的爭執相類似；但因為環境與背景的複雜，却形成今日遠東危局中重要的一環，這一環又被侵略者所緊緊把握着以搭造其南侵的跳板。如果日本不能在這一半島上攫得戰略的據點，則無論其未來南侵主力究將借重於海軍抑或陸軍空軍，終難想像其竟能遠離後方根據地到千數百哩以上而作戰。如果說海南島之被佔是太平洋的一九一八一，則從去秋河南之役以迄最近泰越糾紛的導演以至「調解」，便正無異於「八一三」前夜的種種侵略佈置；徦如此後更不遭遇任何阻礙面逞其所欲，則一遇適當時機，南太平洋未來事變的爆發殆將有類水到渠成之無可避免；這在泰越雙方，又何嘗得因領土爭執解決而暫獲瓦全！預料不久之後，法越當能發現其一再屈服，不過是招致更多的覬覦和脅迫；泰方縱以領土慾望得遂而感到滿足，最後亦必發現無異於吞服了一付有毒的甘餌將，有無窮禍患隨着這一「復土運動」以俱來，終於捲入了為其自身所掀起的南太平洋戰禍而無以自拔。這一不幸前途的造成，泰越雙方與有關列强都應担負相當責任；而另一方面，日方的運用却也頗見其技巧。有如對於法越則利用其孤立無吿的地位而厲加威逼；對於泰方則曲意結歡，甚至不惜慷他人之慨，以越南領土換取泰人好感；這無非預料法越終將無能為力，而泰國近逼印緬，假如加以脅迫，則必轉而與英國相結託。也正因為這種運用乃得在兩邦之間遂其採縱導演的手腕。</p>
<p>但是目前日方所已經完成的還僅是經營這印度支那半島的一個前奏，而其主題則在於如何從雙方索取利益以為酬勞，這也就是完成南侵步驟的重要關鍵。此一要索之如何進行，至今只有種種揣測和傳聞，其究在一調解」之初即已提出了索酬條件而獲得默契，抑或要到「調解」獲有結果之後再恃功向雙方要索，尙乏可資信賴的報告。但若就已往泰越雙方之肯欣然接受日方「調解」而論，似乎以後一假定較為近情。然而所謂調解一舉，日方對泰固足邀功，對越則只有賈怨；而且其間經過月餘時日與若干波折，最近始以法越之無力撑拒而在極端勉强與憤懣中接受其「建議」，則如果更進而索酬，可料其進行必較調解過程更多艱難，這也正是日方一味示惠泰方而壓迫法越所必然得到的結果。如果不是國際間更發生新的變化，日方在越亦未必竟能一切都輕易的如願以償。國際儘多嶄新而酷似的先例：一係借重納粹代為索土而即投入軸心懷抱的匈保，一係曾受德義重惠而至今保持其獨立立塲的西班牙；泰國究將效顰匈保呢，還是取法法於西班牙？這是泰國當局的識見與魄力的試金石。原來它向法越索土是暴露其不智，但是今後却又到了主權名實的存亡關頭，應能加以縝密的考慮了吧</p>
<p>祇在數日之前，日方因為泰越談判擱淺而叫囂焦躁，怨天尤人，從這些表現看來，其對於泰越的控抽，舊顯見還缺乏充分的把握；徒以泰越雙方既不能互信互諒，而有關之列强復旁觀坐視，乃使日方導演得吿完成。隨着歐洲的侵略攻勢，此後南太平洋的演變瞬將屆臨重要階段，而印支半島形勢的每一步推移，皆將成其間極關重要的每一序幕；尙望有關各方能從已往覆轍中領取可寳貴的敎訓。</p>

<p>維希　今日消息、維希政府已允將越南之老撾及柬埔寨區域諸省讓與泰國、緣政府已接受日本之調停方案、該方案保主張將前記爾區域中各省讓泰、法政府此項決議係昨晚閣　決定、應讓與之省有五、一為湄公河以西老撾區域之朗布拉　及巴克西（均譯音）柬埔寨西北境之希姆里浦（譯音）全部、巴坦般（譯音）大部及坎彭東（譯音）省、（二日合衆電）</p>
<p>河內　可靠中立方面昨晚稱、日僑五十人已於昨日下午自河內赴海防、惟據消息靈通界相信、東京日人所稱、謂已維希接受日人調停泰越邊境糾紛之條件、或實有其事、多數觀察家相信、法人接受條件、實係唯一解決辦法、因法國之軍力過弱、不能與日泰聯軍作戰也、同時越督德古中將、拒絕接見地人之訪問、其他政府官吏、亦緘默不肯有所解說云、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>柏林　德官方通訊社維希電訊云、稱法方消恩靈通人士宣稱、由法國駐日大使亨利轉遞之法方對日　調停提議覆文、或可認為係屬認可、惟其中尙有若干點法方需要說明、據云覆文之性質、係開放繼續談判之可能性、並晤示糾紛之和平解決、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>維希　政府關於泰越糾紛所抱態度、業經昨日國務會議在原則上有所決定、並於事後發表公報、簡略提及、外傳半官方面、不久尙須發表文吿、具體說明法國立塲、但此間負責人士對此拒不有所增益、總之、政府在昨日國務會議舉行以前之觀點、不外對於泰國所提各項要求、不承認其在法理上具有充分理由、法國在東京談判中、雖表示妥協精神、顧對於此項法理觀點、未必有所變更耳、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>東京　日半官方而稱、就國外消息觀之、維希政府對日本調解泰越邊界糾紛辦法之態度、有趨向溫和之象、故衆料駐日法大使亨利將於今日與日外相松岡晤談、消息靈通方面咸信法方覆文、將較前溫和、尤其是關於交還柬埔寨西部之問題、聞法大使亨利原定三月一日與松岡會晤、但卒取銷之、因欲硏究維希之訓令並向其政府請予詳示也、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　據昨日「東京日日新聞」載越南特的訪員來電稱、法國全部遠東艦隊已於昨日駛回西貢、按該項艦隊係於　月二十三日突然離　四貢、企圖威嚇進行中之泰越和平談判、該項艦隊現重返西貢、衆料當係貝當對日本幹旋泰越戰事、願意採取較為及好態度之表示云、（二日海通社電）</p>
<p>東京　駐日決大使亨利、今日與日外相松岡會談一小時、法大使似係向日外相詳細解釋法方對日木所提解決泰越爭端條件之答覆、昨日報紙所載維希消息、雖謂法政府已基本接受日方條件、但日本政府在法大使本日訪晤松岡之前、似求曾接獲法政府之正式通知云、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　中央日報載文稱越泰爭案之永久圓滿解決問題、不繫於法國是否接受日　調解之建議、在泰越能否不受外方干涉、而彼此開直接談判、以解決各爭點、英美兩國對於南越發展、不能束手旁觀、蓋日本在泰越之地位、一旦鞏固、則日本第二步驟必為進攻緬甸新加坡、故英美宜速起應付、以免失之過晚、（二日路透社電）</p>

<p>紐約　美聯社訊、據　屬東印度總司令白倍肅特稱、荷屬印度之軍隊數量已增加數倍、以前軍隊祇集中爪哇及蘇門塔拉、但目前　軍已遣往保衛　羅洲及新基尼間各島之海軍根據地、將來軍隊之增加、繫於軍火之運輸、目兩軍火運輸至為遲緩、荷屬東印度決心保衛領土及所有島嶼、（二日塔斯電）</p>
<p>仰光　據報紙所戰之公報緬甸爲保存境內所有鋼鐵起見、凡鋼鐵出口之執照、僅在非常特殊情况下、始許發給、因出產鋼鐵之國、對於鋼鐵亦需求大增也、該公報稱、印度爲鋼鐵出產國、緬甸則否、雖　印輸出、目前固不禁止、然　聽令緬甸所存鋼鐵因此而竭、實非緬甸之福、故勸令商人限制其對印之銷數不得超過戰前原有之數量云、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　蘇聯駐美大使鳥曼斯基、昨向國務副卿威爾斯保證、美國運往蘇聯貨品、正由蘇聯獨自採用、按英政府官吏前會向美提出怨懟、謂美國貨物正由蘇聯漏入德國、又謂蘇聯雖或不致直接將美貨運德、而巳則以美貨塡補缺德云、烏曼斯基之保證以卽對此而發、（二日合衆電）</p>

<p>倫敦　羅馬無綫電消息云、德軍得保國政府之完全同意、將於今日開入保境、此爲軸心方面第一次公開承認德軍擬開入保國、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>蘇菲亞　英使館代言人昨夜宣稱、因德國武力伸入保國利亞之故、英國與保國絕交、祗係數小時內之事、據倫敦消息、英政府已援權駐保公使任臺爾斟酌局勢、隨時與保絕交、英使任台爾定於今日敎堂禮拜後、覲見保王鮑利斯而斷絕外交關係、與兩國宣戰祗差一間、此項步驟何時實行、尚須倫敦訓令、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員今日宣稱、保加利亞駐英公使蒙特基洛夫、已電保政府辭職、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>南國京城　據保京消息、昨日有德機二百五十架越該處、聞保國南部各機塲已落德人手中、並有德方俯衝轟炸機開抵該處、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>保京　德軍團今晨已加緊控制保國主要各地、德工兵方在伐爾那裝設海岸大砲、其意以欲轟擊開入韃靼尼爾之英艦、德軍官技師、佔據私人住宅與別墅、而軍隊分駐於學校及市政廳等處、保京業經正式宣佈爲不設防城市、德軍大本營設於城東南四十哩之處、保京已下嚴厲之熄燈令、無通行證者概不許離城、德軍已完全控制無綫電臺鐵道公路船塢等等、德大軍正沿海岸而下、顯將在鄰近王國之黑海邊境、建立主要前哨、（二日國際電）</p>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　「政治報」頃載有駐保京訪員來電稱、德機二百五十架、已於今晨在保京飛行塲降落、德國摩托化部隊亦於本日午後五時開抵保京、此外保國伐爾那·維亭·暨勒斯契克等城、已見有德軍蹤跡云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>保京　全部武裝準備應戰之德軍、昨夜已控制保京蘇斐亞、彼等搭每次鐵甲車·火車·運兵機·紛紛開入保國各部、似向希臘東北邊境開去、知保國在維也納會議中加入軸心盟約二小時、戴盔之德軍、即搭乘鋼甲汽車開入保京、昨日保京上空德機蔽天、蓋當褐衫軍開過自羅至保之若干橫跨多瑙河橋樑時、胥由大隊德轟炸機及戰鬥機掩護其前進也、保政府殊見驚惶、保京街道上羣衆皆靜觀德軍列隊而過、德軍之開入保國、其速度出於彼等意料之外、高級方面對德軍是否即開希臘抑僅在保國佈防、頗引起熱烈之猜測、但因德軍一般之方向、皆爲希臘邊境、故彼等即將攻希之說。似見更爲合理、（一日國際電）</p>
<p>德勢力伸入巴爾幹企圖促成義希停戰</p>
<p>南國京城　自保國局勢展開後、此間外交界即預測德立將對南國提出最後通牒、衆信業已進佔保國之德人、在彼等企圖利用南國調停希義戰爭以前、暫時將未必進攻希臘、此間政界方面僉以爲、希臘拒絕軸心國所提解決希義戰爭之條件、結果必將使德方之閃電戰進展至薩洛尼加區、外交家泰半均信、南斯拉夫不復能安然處於軸心國之外、（二日國際社電）</p>
<p>維希　據此外交界人士觀察、保國適在巴爾幹局勢危急之秋、加入三國同盟、此在軸心國方面、自將日此爲對於英土兩國最近在土京進行談話之一種答覆、至於德軍開抵保京之說、雖未獲官方證實、但爲保國加入三國同盟後之必然結果、良以軸心國此際實以儘量擴展其第一道防綫爲有利故也、此外尚有一事殆可斷言者、即不論英國或土耳其倘若採取任何含有侵略性質之舉行、軸心國定必立即有所反響、例如英軍倘在希臘境內登陸、則德國定必有所舉動、此其用意不啻警告英國、務勿干涉巴爾幹半島戰事、要之、希臘現已陷於孤立、現行局勢演變之結果、將使該國對於單獨與義國媾和之議、不得不予以較大之重視、亦未可必云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>德國完成軍事佈置　殆爲援義攻希先聲</p>
<p>維希　德軍開入保國之後、此間各觀察家咸認爲此舉、未必在軍事上立即產生何項後果、特保國與希臘交界地帶、不僅多係山地、抑且正在希臘薩洛尼加港之北面、德軍開抵保國邊境之後、將有居高臨下之勢、此則對於未來軍事行動、自不免發生重大影響耳、查英國自在菲洲方面迭獲勝利以還、其在愛琴海沿岸之軍略地位、亦已因此而佔有優勢、但上種優勢、今後殆將難以保持、良以截至月下爲止、英軍在巴爾幹方面作戰之對象、僅爲遠涉海道備受英艦隊威脅之義大利軍隊、今後剛須直接與德軍對壘、據倫敦泰晤士報估計、德國陸軍全部實力不下二百二十五師、其中鐵甲師佔十三師、摩托化部隊佔十師、其在多瑙河下游者、當有五十萬員名之譜、此項部隊雖因散於羅保兩國境內、而致交通綫甚長、但其防地莫不遠離海岸、因此正可不受英國艦隊之困擾、此殆德軍作戰較義軍便利之又一理由云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>南國處境陷於孤立　德對南施恐怖策略</p>
<p>南國京城　德人現正對南斯拉夫採取恐怖策略、今日有德轟炸機飛越斯柯爾普傑地方、但其中一架已被南斯拉夫戰鬥機迫令降陸、又有德機七架曾侵犯希佛林對面之南國領土、南國守軍曾開機槍射擊、迫其向羅馬尼亞方面退去、南國已在多瑙河區域各重要地點、布置高射砲位、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>維然　保加利亞加入三國盟約之後、一般人咸以該國或將積極援助軸心爲慮、但此間若干政治觀察家認爲、該國未必立即實施盟約、緣盟約第三條規定、必須一簽約國遭受「目下尚未參戰各國之攻擊」、其他各簽約國始乃出而予以援助、彼英國既早爲交戰國、按諸法理自不能適用此項條款、職是之故、所謂互助條約、必須俟土耳其採取侵略行動之後、始可予以援引、無如多數觀察、家均不信土國即將忽遽有所行動、並力言該國歷來外交活動、與其謂爲傾向戰爭、毋寗謂爲傾向和平、準此而論、三國盟約之重要性、殆不在其理論的運用、而在其精神的影響、至以保國而論其加入盟約不啻聲明將過云拒絕參加任何盟約並與各國審愼訂交之一貫政策予以放棄、曠觀今日、巴爾幹半島各國中惟一南斯拉夫國尚未與交戰各國發生任何盟約關係、惟是該國處境孤立此種態度究竟能否維持久遠、殊屬疑問耳、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>土國安全倘受威脅　準備與英駢肩作戰</p>
<p>土京　德軍開入保國之消息、使土京如受電震、土政府發言人昨日謂、若巴爾幹因此發生戰事、土國安全遭受威脅、則土或將被迫與英駢肩作戰、此語之發展、係在英外相艾登與參謀大臣狄爾離土以後、艾狄二氏與土領袖商妥政治外交軍事之聯合計劃後、已由土啟程前往開羅、（二日國際社電）</p>
<p>安加拉　此間對於保加利亞之參加三國公約、不甚表示驚異、並認此爲德國對英外相艾登訪問土京之答覆、土內閣曾召集會議、檢討艾登該問之結果、（二日路透社電）</p>

<p>名評論家伍德海、昨日在英文大美週報發表一文、評論日本　處泰越糾紛事件、略稱、過去一週遠東人士之注意力、全部集中於泰越糾紛、及日本之調停、日本為强迫越南割讓土地　於泰國計、不惜提出維希所不能接受之條件、限其於一定之時期內答復、並訓令旅越日僑、作撤退準備、又於越南附近結集大批陸海軍、在此種情勢下、越南惟有被迫接受日方之建議、此種强權政治、在歐洲已屬司空見慣之事、因之、第三個軸心　若師承　特勒墨素里之故智、實無令人驚異之必要、我人若不健忘、則應　及數月　、日本曾向越　保　尊重越南領土之完整、最近期內、日本之政治家、亦曾一再宣稱、日本並無在東亞各處使用武力之意、此種言論、毫不足奇、因任何軸心國家、在從事侵略之前、必先發表此種言論也、泰國乘人之危、賴他國之援助、從事侵略、以為得計、然不自知其本身亦已　　「東亞共榮國」之中、引狼入室、雖獲得若干土地、但已喪失、孰得孰失、不待　者而後知、泰國其為遠東之保加利亞乎、</p>
<p>越南所受經濟束縛</p>
<p>著名經濟評論家阿勒　、昨日在英文大美週報發表一文、評論日本之經濟的南進政策、略稱、日本希望東亞各國能自動參加其所謂「東亞共榮國」、然各國於目擊日越·日荷·經濟談判情形後、對所謂「東亞共榮圈」已有認識、殊乏自動參加之熱誠、蓋日本與越南·荷印·談判時、殆已明白表示無意實行平等互惠原則、其目的僅圖能獲得片面利益、而不擬交出任何貨物作為交換條件、</p>
<p>政治軍事同施壓力</p>
<p>同時、為强迫越南荷印接受其要求計、不惜使用政治的及軍事的壓力、越南與日本談判時、因日軍業已侵入、同時沿海及湄公河下游、皆有日艦游弋、故其處境不如荷印為侵、荷印至今仍處日本勢力範圍之外、其防　亦較為鞏固、因之與日本作經濟談判時、能堅持若干原則、</p>
<p>越南屈服一任擺布</p>
<p>越南情形　不同、幾一任日本擺布、日文所提重大要求、十九皆已接受、證之日越雙方一月二十日在東亞所成立之經濟協定、越南在經濟上、已竭力使日本滿意、日本對於越南最重要之經濟資源、有優先選擇之權、據最近自西貢傳來之　國消息稱、越南將於本年度內供給日本食米七十萬噸、（佔日本外米進口額三分之一）、橡皮　萬五千噸、（佔越南橡皮出口額三分之一、日本進口需要額二分之一）、此外、越南尙　以大宗玉蜀黍·煤·燐·灰石等物、供給日本、</p>
<p>履行義務限制出口</p>
<p>越南為履行其對日之義務計、採取特殊辦法多項、例如自上月份起、西貢米出口、已受益禁運限制、除運至日法兩國者外、已不得運至其他各地、（過去所預定者除外）同時組織一特別出口機關、採用限額制及執照制、統制對外貿易、如限制橡皮出口等等、越南對於運至日本之物品、雖盡量謀所以使日本滿足、然對於日本運至越南之物品、擬效法日本之組織、成立進口機關、予以統制、但日方大表不滿、日本報紙復大肆抨擊、認越方有意破壞一月二十日所成立之經濟協定、</p>
<p>越南方面並無所獲</p>
<p>日本此舉之目的、　在壓迫越南允許日本貨物侵入、越南並非不需要日本貨物、當日越在東京談判時、越南曾通知日本、希望日本能以越南所需要之物品、諸如五金·化學品·藥品及染料等物供給之、當時日方曾允諾、時至今日、越南已接受其要求、而日本所允供給之物品、則　面不予、　以越南所不需要之繼維織品·及玩具等物、供給越南、</p>

<p>雙方在河內東京進行此項談判時、日方又急不及待、壓迫法方根據一月份所成立之協定、履行其片面之義務、目下、西貢米已大批運赴日本、橡皮不久亦可運去、荷印目擊越南所受之痛苦後、物喪其類、當然不能無斷於中、荷印在去年所成立之煤油協定下、對日本已特別寬　、以油產之三分之一供給日本、</p>
<p>荷印不懼任何威脅</p>
<p>根據去年之協定、其中一部份之油產、係用物物交換辦法、日本貪得無饜、最近又希望荷印以更多之油類供給之、荷印之答復為、「請付現款」在荷印首府所舉行之談判、其主要癥結、即在於此、日本第二次派赴荷印之經濟代表團　然不若首次準備之充分、日本之目的、似在用威脅恫嚇之辦法、迫荷印步越南之後塵、與其成立同樣之片面商業協定、荷印對於合理之要求、並非不肯接受、然荷印旣非絕無辦法、亦無失敗主義之情緒、因之、企圖以威脅越南之辦法、行之荷印、必難奏效、</p>

<p>若其不繼又當別論</p>
<p>據初步之佔計、公共租界减供　流以後、受影響甚嚴　者為紡織及機器工業、而華商廠家　之目下開工達最高限度者、或將首蒙影響、因此而發生之失業逆流、當然為委員會所應予考慮之一題、惟法租界之廠家及公眾因法佛萊已作明白之保證、故仍有用電之自由、時局若有不能預測之事發生、則又當別論、</p>
<p>油料供給來自荷印</p>
<p>良以本埠所有之燃料油之供應、均仰給於荷屬東印度、法佛萊作該保留的限制之原因、顯然為南太平洋之局勢動盪不定、至上海電力公司之發電、大部份均藉煤斤、某一部份機件、最近經改革使用燃燒油、然佔全部機器之比率、不及百分之二十、惟南洋一且有事、燃燒油之供給、亦將與煤斤發生同　困難、因交戰國必互相集中於　沈油船也、</p>

<p>該文原係蘇聯石油人民委員會轄下瓦斯總管處長兼工程師鮑克謝門（U.Boksierman）所作，載在莫斯科一月三日出版伊茲魏斯基亞（Izvestia）報。　——譯音</p>
<p>天然汽油按最高熱量計（每立方俄碼達八千略洛列（熱度單位）暨化學上組成，乃係對工業企業與城市不僅作為絕佳燃料，且為有價生產品，優等揮發油，汽油所產出之煤烟及其他類伊品之製造原料。故第二次大戰時資本主義國家認為應廣大發展之工業即天然汽油，尤其以美國為最。</p>
<p>美國天然汽油之採取，一九三九年時為六百二十二億六千萬立方俄碼，一九三八年時，又管理所有天然汽油之採量，工業企業佔百分之七十九，生活需要佔百分之十六。生產汽油井量於一九三八年末時已達五萬三千個。</p>
<p>美國有最大之汽油輸運長程，計汽油網長距（幹綫長分配）於一九三八年時達三十萬公車；其中全年產生汽油為一百八十萬萬立方俄碼，特如比率上一九三九年間優質揮發油山天然汽油中所產出計五百五十萬噸，一九四零年瓦斯工廠達六百二十所。</p>
<p>美國巨大擴充石油燒成液體瓦斯之事業，其販賣量於一九三九年時約九萬萬利　，較一九三八年增百分之三十六。自從一九二九年至一九三九年（共十年）間液體瓦斯之需用在美國高至九十倍，液體瓦斯具有高度熱量計為一百，適用代替揮發油，以作自動運輸或推動器暨生活上需要。美國汽油工業投資為美金四百九十八萬萬元，其中天然汽油之工業為美金二百六十七萬萬元。較其他投　猶巨：如汽車工業為十三萬萬美元，鑄鋼工業為四十萬美元n·烟油之出產，於一九三九年間已達二十三萬八千噸以上。</p>
<p>蘇聯預定天然汽油之儲備，約與美國相等；猶以其產區之試掘及設備之不足，蘇聯中央執行委員會第十八屆全體會議大會後列為主要議案，決定擴充石油上獲取汽油利益及清理汽油產區暨地下煤炭瓦斯化，在第三期五年計劃中應增為三倍半。</p>
<p>天然汽油產額於一九四二年必須增產二倍，近兩年間之基本工作，在注意蘇聯國內石油地域別之需要，佔計產額之發展，及石油上汽油之改造。</p>
<p>共產黨中央執行委員會及蘇聯人民委員會議不久頒布奪門對於石油汽油利用暨揮發油生產之發展命令。此種決定乃係石油工業工作人員之進行程序。</p>
<p>天然汽油工業為蘇聯國民經濟上幼芽之一，其本體上在五年計劃斯達林年（即本年）被其已組成或現組成，阿齊爾巴也仁（Azerbaig　zanskaja地名）石油工業中汽油之掘取較一九一三年已增高十倍以上。</p>
<p>一九四零年蘇聯石油工業人民委員會汽油經濟工作之改良已被達到，自七月間起實際上超過完成汽油掘採計劃，並改良其施用。雖前此少有汽油之掘採及施用上之改良，唯一問題在於整理汽油及揮發油之損失。</p>
<p>汽油在石油營業上消損尙甚巨大，其基本原因在汽油產區建築秘密制度之缺乏，（由石油掘井口至貯油池進貨所之鍊取組織）及新油井暨新石油區汽油區汽油取得工作停頓。</p>
<p>石油營業上尙有土塊，消耗汽油，及蒸發分溜等問題。首先應消滅此種土塊，因此需先改良噴油之油池暨汽油唧筒之建造以及壓榨器，由空氣壓入吸油法替代石油壓榨採取法。</p>
<p>蘇聯共產黨中執行委員會及人民委員會議決定規訂一九四一年至一九四二年營業及秘密建築工作之程序，此種工作須於近兩年內在巴庫，馬也廣巴，伊什姆巴雅，蒲科羅斯拉那等蘇聯基本油區完全成就。汽油之貯池及運輸最大工作須敷設於喀薩斯垣，土爾克敏，及比黎喀姆等地。</p>
<p>秘密建築工作首先為阿速夫石油公司總托拉司，第一期賜與顯著工作，「斯太林」「喀岡諾維赤」及「阿茲伊茲別克」等石油公司各托拉司已曾建有石質及鐵質石油　備室，鍊製　及管筒，該處計有數百掘井交換公開倉庫，由空氣轉取汽油之壓榨站七所。其揮發油之發展，較一九三八年，計蘇拉哈石油增千分之六至七油喀拉楚霍爾石油增千分之七至十，波丁石油增百分之一以上。</p>
<p>阿齊爾巴也仁公司，聯同黨部機關堅決掘採石油，用氣壓採汽油計一畫夜達百餘噸。而其他石油掘採托拉司，　二十至三十噸。因此「基洛夫」「喀岡諾維赤」，「更爾吉茲」及其他等石油公司各托拉司設法吸取噴油，凝結黑色拚發岩，由公開倉庫中結成掘井，敷設汽油唧筒及其他等。</p>
<p>其結果進行甚速，共公司具體上非但完成，且超過國家計劃，汽油產量平日採取增百分之二十，尤其以喔爾約尼基特齊石油公司之托拉司採取汽油結果最佳。確可保證由新井上掘採汽油，步入系統化，同時宜配設唧筒及黑色迸發岩。</p>
<p>政府今頒布關於一九四一年一月一日建築新油井及油池掘採汽油未經實施工作之禁令，此項禁令施於秘密建築工作，同時以及營業經濟之一般發展。</p>
<p>關於瓦斯二廠建設工作，唯一問題在乎短期內保證由石油中所採掘之揮發油之抽取，因此建設新工廠，使於短期間內載運現有瓦斯工廠之汽油，巴庫及格魯茲工廠工作並非全有力量，雖具有載運之可能。</p>
<p>近兩年內必須實施液體瓦斯利用之偉大工作，在液體瓦斯示出天然汽油分溜之斷塊草堆，汽油揮發油生產巨大發展，勵行擴充液體瓦斯之富源。</p>
<p>液體瓦斯在汽車輸運上替代燃料，蘇聯已進入實騐時期。由政府機關設計，企圖前驅，並將優良部份廣布介紹汽車供給站必須建立瓦斯工廠（現有或建設）歸由飛機及自動車儲倉管轄。巴庫第一站建設已經完成。</p>
<p>有關各人民委員會（如中等機器，黑金屬，及石油等三會）關於此問題表示不容遲緩，留別列次基工廠液體瓦斯塲在短期間內得將揮發油運往莫斯科公共汽車塲（約二三個月）。莫斯科市政府頒布此項命令尙在一九三九年，但迄今尙未做到。</p>
<p>第三期五年計劃中，努力於清深汽油產區的天然汽油之生產利用。該產區設備尙覺不足，更須大為組織與試掘。</p>
<p>近兩年內必須發展汽油之利用，以廣米自治國之伊茹姆之烏克蘭西部區域為最要。</p>
<p>現在已被建造之達沙瓦，喔巴利及喀羅什等產區，已可保證工業　業及烏克蘭西部各市之汽油供給。儲備而提高該區域之需要，故將汽油唧管溝通基也夫地方，五年以來基也夫作成汽油供給草案，但殊覺不足，故輸入唐聶次燃料。</p>
<p>伊茹姆汽油產區掘有十一油井，伊茹姆之汽油可用支配管轉運北烏拉爾，畢列茲尼基，蘇列格姆斯克，莫洛托夫及其他地方之工業中心，此轉運汽油其實施長程上應再組織之。</p>
<p>此外必須組織達吉斯坦汽油試掘，該處已有化學玻璃，碘酒及其他工廠之設立，但達吉斯坦產區廣大，猶未充分利用。</p>
<p>薩波羅茹州提鍊汽油，大可發展近美利都波利地之沿阿速無產區，油泉深僅七十至八十碼，開井毋須十日至十五日；喔爾特約基特齊邊疆之沃洛什洛夫斯克，亦可開發。</p>
<p>一九四一至一九四二年石油工業工作人員勵行推動天然汽油工業，為蘇聯國民經濟上最有力量之準備。</p>

<h3 id="c66">物價高漲的秘密 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 沈雷春</p>
<p>自從近日遠東風雲緊張以後，美日的和戰戰問題，為一般人所注意，尤其是一般操縱市塲的投機商人，他們把中日戰局以致無論任何有關遠東的國際問題都認為是製造　塲漲跌空氣的好現象。尤其是在上海的擁有鉅大游資的大腹賈們，他們的三部曲是：一，製造謠言，二，　積居奇，三，抬高物價，這本來是三位一體而進行的。但我們為了抗建，為了中華民族的前途，為了民生問題的普遍好轉，我們應該怎樣去制止物價的上漲，這可以說是目前經濟戰綫上最嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>本來上海物價的上漲，與內地不同，自從歐亞戰事爆發以來，對於上海與各方面的運輸綫，尙還沒有發生到如自由中國般的絕對的困難，所以上海的物價飛漲，並不是由於運輸困難，和供需失調，如去年秋天的內地物價上漲的種類與倍數：一，金屬材料十二倍，二，燃料九倍，三，衣料七倍，四，雜類四倍奇，五，建築材料四倍，六，食料三倍。這是內地交通較便利的普通一般情形，但在上海看來，一般說來，雖然是一樣的在上漲，但從種類看來，却大不相同，或幾乎成了一個反比例，食料與日用品的上漲，也幾幾乎站在第一位上，如申報社評內說：「戰事以來，物價上漲最高者，莫過於米煤麵粉，駸駸乎十倍之數。」所以如果說上海的物價上漲，是由於供求不平衡，那更是牛頭不對馬嘴。</p>
<p>說到上海，雖然還是中國社會之一，它的經濟機構，與自由中國的半封建半殖民地的性質不同，因為它是買辦階級構成部份之一，半封建本來是不存在的，但是自從國軍西撤，上海淪為孤島以後，上海的經濟，沒有一天不在畸形中成長，發展，因為京滬，滬杭兩綫本來就是富饒之地，自從他們的家鄉淪陷以後，凡是擁有鉅額流動資金的富翁們，大多數是跟着淪陷區中的銀行一起撤退，他們雖然還列入於「高等難民」，但在上海來作了「寓公」以後，因為投身在買辦階級，殊不容易，所以對於這些鉅額資金的置處問題，當然不外乎投資與投機兩途了。</p>
<p>所以我認為對於上海物價上漲的問題，實在不是怎麽供需失調。我們不要相信那些投機份子的鬼話，尤其是米蛀蟲的鬼話，供需失調是有它的物價上漲的平衡律的，現在上海物價上漲律與供需失調大相逕庭，所以我們說不是供需失調。</p>
<p>有些自命為懂得經濟學的人以為：戰事爆發，通貨必然膨脹，但照上海的物價上漲的情形說來，可以說並不是法幣流通額的增加，我們大家知道，自從淪為孤島以後的上海游資，可以統計的有了二十萬萬元，但據去年六月底中中交農四行正式發表過的法幣發行額共計為三十九萬萬餘元，如果上海的流資都是法幣的話，那末四行的法幣發行額一定不止此數，這一點可以證明出，上海的游資，還是銀行存款和公債期貨居多數，而收藏大量法幣為財產的，却還很難見到，所以上海的游資，多於無形的法幣而少於有形的法幣，所以可以說上海的物價高漲，既不能說供需失調，也不能說通貨膨脹。</p>
<p>但是近幾年來，一般平民因了生活程度的高漲，在切身痛苦之餘，所感覺到的新發明的辭句，是：「鈔票不值錢」，鈔票不值錢這句話，雖也脫胎於通貨膨脹。雖然通貨膨脹的結果，使幣值下跌，而影響到物價上漲，這確是顛撲不破的理由。但照一般通貨膨脹說來，引起物價上漲，是逐漸的，而近來上海物價的飛漲情形，並不是逐漸的，而是跳躍式的，尤其是隨着時局風聲的轉變而轉變，雖然四行在戰前發行的法幣額僅十四萬萬餘元，與三十九萬萬元的比例，尙不到三倍，但上海的物價上漲與通貨增發是沒有怎麽大關係的。</p>
<p>不過歸根的說來，穩定法幣價值，是戰時經濟政策上所必需做的，但回頭說起來，平抑物價還是防止通貨惡性膨脹上實際工作的措施。</p>
<p>又有人說：外滙降跌也是物價上漲的一個原因，尤其上海是一個外滙黑市的大市塲，滙價影響物價，在經濟不能獨立的國家，這是勢所必然的，我　　也承認中國的經濟勢力尙不能完全獨立。也是毋庸諱言的事實，當戰事開始的時候，法幣對英滙率是一先令二便士半，為法定滙價，一直到現在，從滙價下跌的比率上看來，也不過跌落到四分之三左右而矣，與英鎊聯系的港幣滙價看來，也差不多。照滙價說來，外貨進口的價格，應該上漲到一律四倍左右，方能說與滙價的比率相平衡，但目前洋貨進口的價格，較抗戰開始時漲起七八倍至十倍的指數，那至少不能說明滙價的變動是物價飛漲的主因，而尤為奇怪的是目前暴漲的物價，以國內產銷的日常必需品居首位，那尤其與外滙黑市下落無關了。</p>
<p>穩定外滙黑市價格，也是戰時對外經濟政策所必要的，但上海外滙黑市下跌的原因，並不是因為近來洋貨進口的特別旺盛，而主要點是被某方以法幣套取外滙，其次是國內大腹賈與腐敗份子的資金向海外逃亡，以致上海黑市外滙不住的下跌，而目前在上海進口的洋貨，而並不是怎麽軍械，食糧雖有，而還是居次要地位，而主要的還是富翁達貴們所消耗的奢華品。他們有錢，在上海操縱了市塲，發國難財，生活上儘量可以醉生夢死。中下等的人們，雖然不需要用洋貨，不消耗外滙，而他們所用的國貨，却負担了用外貨的責任，那就是國貨物價的同時高漲，在此扶搖直上的高漲聲浪中，已追出了洋貨的高漲價率，這就是用洋貨的少數人把國貨來囤積居奇，就是二十萬萬游資在作怪，而並不是外滙跌價。</p>
<p>物價高漲的秘密，如果說以上三項都不是主因，那末就是囤積居奇了。我們也認為是這一點，因為以上三點，雖然可以幫助物價高漲，但不是主要原因，就是以二十萬萬游資麕集而成在作怪的囤積居奇了。</p>
<p>囤積貨物，壟斷居奇，這不是投資，而是投機的行為。自從戰事以後，他們眼見到上海附近一帶的民族工業因戰爭而毀滅與受某方的摧殘，淪陷區域的被統制，自由中國之被封鎖，尤其內地物質條件缺乏，交通困難之類，都能使投機家有機可乘，有隙可入，囤積居奇，本來是投機之一種，他們為了穩妥起見，囤積的都是些日用必需品為大宗，現在日用品價格之飛漲，就是　個證明。</p>
<p>投機商人為了發國難財，把國計民生，都拋到九霄雲外去了，他們看到囤積愈甚，物價愈漲，盈利愈厚，但不知道他們的反面，物價漲而使消費者購買力愈感薄弱，由生活恐慌而形成社會恐慌，戰事階段，愈益延長，一般人民，受到更大的痛苦，雖然國府在提倡努力生產，節約消費，但給囤積居奇的投機家在抵消，從民眾艱苦的生活達到勝利階段當然在延長，這些老實說都是囤積居奇的投機者之所賜。</p>
<p>我們要壓低物價還到原來的價格，固然是事屬困難，但如果用怎樣的方法來消滅囤積居奇者的投機家，至少上海的物價可以回跌些，即使不易回跌的話，亦可以使將來的物價不再上漲。</p>
<p>對於制裁囤風，這是目前急需的一件事，但怎樣去制裁，確是當務之急，雖然有人主張：一，良心制裁，二，政治制裁，三，警告制裁，但又有人說，良心制裁，於投機家是對牛彈琴，政治制裁，國府的命令到達上海時，上海可惜己為一孤島矣，無法使其執行，警告制裁，警告到無辦法時，也只有實行懲治之一途，但我認為用精神　動員法在上海執行，用良心，政治，警告三種辦法同時執行，雖不宜操之過火，但總比不辦好些，將來至少可以收到一部份效力，物價高漲的祕密，並不是一個謎，只要我們趕緊的　多方面的執行制裁囤積居奇者就是了。</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>飲咖啡的風俗，在十六世紀初傳到埃及，到了十七世紀中葉纔傳到歐洲；自從土耳其大使用以　客以後，它格外的大出風頭起來，可是那時的咖啡貿易，完全操縱在埃及人手裏：他們從Moka城把咖啡捆載到歐洲各國去，如同各種專賣機關一樣，價值當然是隨意劃定了。這不免把歐洲人剝削的有點疾首蹙額起來：他們不願意仰埃及人的鼻息，向他們多納這一種過境稅，在一七一〇年的時候，有法國Bretagne省Saint·Male城的商人，組織了一個公司，繞過非洲好望角而直接往Moka城去採購咖啡。同時歐洲人看見咖啡的需要日殷，利息豐厚，也想法經各殖民地試行培植起來。首先實現這計畫的是荷蘭人Nicolas　Witsen：他在一六九〇年，把第一棵咖啡樹携到爪哇，到了一七四三年，已竟能把三百五十萬斤咖啡豆運到荷蘭母國去了！錫蘭島和印度的咖啡樹全是從爪哇傳過去的。法國的初有咖啡樹，是在一七一四年，就是那西班牙王位繼承戰爭結束的一年。荷蘭阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam）城的市長，從爪哇得到了些咖啡樹，就贈給法國名王路易第十四一株，路易十四把它栽植到　名的巴黎植物園裏。公元一七二三年，有一個名叫De　Clieu的法國軍官，得到國王路易十五的特許携帶着從植物園分種出來的三棵咖啡樹，渡海往西印度羣島的Martinique島赴任去，在途中食水短少了，兩株咖啡樹已竟乾死；DE　Clieu不忍把這心愛的第三株旱壤，乃同甘共苦的把自己剩的一口水與那小樹平分，纔救了它的性命。這是西印度羣島有咖啡樹的　始，以後各島的咖啡樹差不多全是這一株的嫡系子孫·至於現在執着咖啡豆的牛耳，出產量佔全世界十分之八九的巴西，它的正式栽培咖啡樹較晚，不過開始於一八一五年，雖說在一七七三年已竟有一位敎士把咖啡樹移植過去。</p>
<p>現在　一談在現代都市中佔社交上那麽重要的位置，和茶寮酒肆　　而三的咖啡館的簡史。咖啡館的創立，實始於十五世紀的初年，首先發現於回敎聖　的麥加城中；以後在全阿拉伯半島，埃及，叙利亞各地，如同雨後剋筍似的到處設立起來。土耳其帝國京城君士坦丁堡的初有咖啡館是在一五五三年，是兩個叙利亞人開辦的。自從這咖啡館設立以來，無數的回敎徒，摩　接　的麕集在它裏頭，營業眼看着一天一天的興盛。回敎敎主目擊這種情形，恐怕回敎聖堂將來沒有人光顧，要變成一片曠野了，乃勒令咖啡館停閑：罰飲咖啡的顧客在公斷的日期，身上披着如同咖啡渣滓一般黑的獸皮，把咖啡館的兩個主人每人責打了八十棍了事。可是飲咖啡已竟蔚為風氣，非暴力所可阻抑的，後來禁令取銷，各處又開設起咖啡館來，不過給國家出點捐稅罷了。法國的咖啡館，是在一六五四年首先創立於馬賽；稍後，在一六七二年，在歷史上久負盛名，而為無數著名的文學家，哲學家，或政客們光顧集會地方的巴黎Procope咖啡館，和Pascal咖啡館，也先後成立了·而且是Procope咖啡館首先發明製造「冰結漣」的法子用以供給，立刻得到顧主們的歡迎而各地風行起來。倫敦的咖啡館是創立於一六六二年；可是它的數目加增的那麽快，以致到了一六六五年國王Charles第二已竟有些戰悸，不能不把它們封閉了：說這是藏垢納汚，陰謀叢生的奸人澤藪！至於歐洲其他大都市的咖啡館也差不多是同時風起雲湧的到處成立了。後來有人另出花樣，在咖啡館裏附帶着演戲，跳舞，作音樂，以廣招徠，它的生意當然要日興月盛因循一直到現今的狀况了。</p>

<h3 id="c73">家庭的新生活運動 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>蔣委員長提倡的新生活運動，很快的已整整七年了。在這整整七年之中，有幾許人袪除舊惡習，走上新生路？又有幾許人遵守禮，義，廉，恥，實踐整齊，淸潔，簡單，樸素，迅速，確實的規的？從個人推想到一家家庭裹的情形，大多數是散漫，凌亂，無秩序，什物亂堆，不成樣子；當主婦的一切委之於無知識的傭婦，自己却俾夜作畫的遊竹園（义麻雀）看電影，聽戲，跳舞，恣　享樂；第二天日上三竿，猶未起身，蓬頭亂服，精神不振，還有什麼整齊，淸潔可言？還有什麼簡單，樸素和迅速確實可言呢？這現象尤以被稱為冒險家樂園的孤島上的家庭為甚；其次，淪陷區居家的烟賭盛行，也是不可諱言的。蔣委員長說：「這是大家自取滅亡的內在的敵人！」誠痛切言之。筆者認為家庭主婦的能否實踐「家庭新生活運動，」是國族復興與否的起點，古聖賢說：「身修而後家齊，家齊而後國治，國治而後天下平，」朱伯廬先賢的家訓裏也說：「黎明即起，洒掃庭除，要內外整潔，旣昏便息，門戶必親自檢點……」云云，都是主婦們治家的「座右銘」。要「人家興旺不衰」！非實踐整齊，淸潔，簡單，樸素，迅速，確實等規的不為功。</p>
<p>蔣委員長在　運七週年紀念席上廣播的演詞，大家尤應深切牢記，努力信守奉行。他說：「……我們為什麼要提倡禮，義，廉，恥呢？大家須知「禮」的對面，就是不重秩序，不守紀律，不諳規矩；「義」的對面，就是不講信義，不盡職責，不負責任；「廉」的對面，就是不明是非，不辨公私，不重操守；「恥」的對面，就是沒有氣節，沒有羞惡，沒有覺悟；所以我們必須改正這種缺點，纔算實踐了「四維」……大家須知，「整齊」的對面，是混亂，散漫，「淸潔」的對面，是汚穢腐敗，「簡單」的對面，是複雜，繁瑣，「樸素」的對面，是奢侈浮華，「迅速」的對面，是遲鈍，麻木，「確實」的對面，是虛僞，欺詐，這六大病根，如果能完全剷除，中國的建國工作，便一日千里………」我說在家庭方面，能够做到蔣委員長所昭示的剷除那六大病根，這個大好家庭，纔是中國建國工作中的一個堅强的細胞。主婦們！起來吧！革面洗心吧！大家庭方面的大大小小的「衣，食，住，行，」要趕快做到整齊，淸潔，簡單，樸素，迅速，確實，六大生活規的，嚴守生活紀律，纔不愧為將來新中國的新家庭。</p>
<h3 id="c74">中國女子果眞需要帽子嗎？ <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 亦珍</p>
<p>讀了　月二十四日本刋期　君的大作「中國婦女為什麽沒有帽子」一文，眞感佩斯君劉中國婦女的帽子，會有這樣週詳的研究；可是中國女子果眞需要子帽子嗎？那倒有商榷的必要。</p>
<p>中國女子並不是絕對沒有帽子，是無可諱言的，而鳳冠包頭的淘汰，提作所以沒有帽子或不用帽子的證明則可，若認為就是缺乏帽子的理由，則萬萬不可，須知「缺乏」和「沒有」是逈然異　的！</p>
<p>至於髮網和絲帶的流行，就說「中國婦女需要帽子」也多少帶有附會：婦女們並不致因不戴帽子而生神經病且不去說它；實則髮網和絲帶的流行，正單是以避免頭髮散亂為指歸的，這句話可用目今少女梳辮子的濫觴，和中年以上婦女盛行梳頭來證實，講到「偶然發現鄕婦戴有碗狀帽子」，也就是說這是由於伊們生活環境的特殊而形成的；同時更可窺出：在大部份中國婦女的生活圈內，沒有這種多餘的所謂「需要」！</p>
<p>實際的講：外國婦女的所以戴帽，自有伊們的歷史背景，和　統的習俗；而七矮人奇特帽子能在美國風行，更可藉以洞悉美國婦女心理的缺點！穿旗袍的中國女子，決不願這樣盲目地望帽興歎，除非伊是十足道地的洋奴！</p>
<p>女帽的是否需要旣如上述，况且今日的中國正在實行着節的運動，誰還儍瓜似地甘願担當背道而馳的嫌疑呢？</p>
<p>末了有二點，筆者認為有一提的價値：第一服裝的唯一條件在實用，不在奇特，第一歐內服飾雖有可取之處，但一味效顰，做洋人的尾巴，却是要不得而父要不得的。</p>
<h3 id="c75">經濟煮飯法 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 英鈞</p>
<p>際　米珠薪桂的時代，人人感覺生活困難，孤島受時局影　，商業比　上年已有遜色，故謀生之艱難，可想而知。開源已無方法，節流實屬急要，惟拇節之道，至多且廣，決非短篇文字所可盡述。茲先將每大三餐所必需要之米，應如何用經濟的力法煮成可口白飯，詳陳於下以供採擇：</p>
<p>每天預剩冷飯二三碗，於炊飯時將冷飯摻入淘凈之米內，攪和使勻，然後入鍋，與平常炊煮之法同；而煮熟後所得之飯，必較不摻冷飯之純米飯為多，此冷飯俗稱「冷飯娘」，即表示生生不巳也。據筆者經騐所得，大的冷飯與生米之比率，冷飯至多不得超過生米三分之一，否則味遜。譬如八口之家，每餐須用米八碗，而煮成之飯約二十四碗，如摻加冷飯一碗半，則所煮熟之飯二十七碗，可供九人之食，所增飯的一碗半，即可節省生米半碗；日積月累，每年節省米錢，亦殊可觀。凡欲實騐上項辦法者，請先多煮一二碗飯，留作次餐之冷飯娘，備摻人生米煮飯之用可矣。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 拜石</p>
<p>庭　在住的一項中佔着個很重要的地位，更可以說是精神食糙，可是在孤島上有庭園設備的實在是少得有如鳳毛麟角，</p>
<p>一個庭園中非得有幾塊玲瓏的湖石點綴其間，才足以使庭園生色，更可得到不少的雅趣、所以庭園和湖石是不可分離而打成一片的。講到湖石，皺，透，瘦，漏是它四大必要條件，如果其中有一項缺如，便不能算是一塊上　的奇石。在戰後的孤島上，這種十全十美的湖石是不大看見。可是筆者最近在高恩路黃園中却發現了不少的奇石，而其中最奇的要算是那塊上　刻着「小支機」的一石，的摸有七八尺高，重有二三噸左右，而且皺，透，瘦，漏的四大條件都具備的，簡直不像是塊天然的湖石，而似乎是由人工雕鑿而成的。「支機」石的來源，根據辭源上說：「有人尋河源，見婦人浣紗，問之，曰此天河也，乃與一石而歸，問嚴君平，君平曰此織女支機石也」。此石稱為「小支機，神妙可知。其次要算那塊「朶雲」石，比「小支機」石還要來得大。石上刻着的字是顯得很蒼老的了。後來據該園主人黃岳淵老先生說：「這批湖石是由蘇州常熟間的個舊園子中拆下來的，一路運到上海，煞費九牛虎之力。况且我　有一年不曾出過鐵絲綱，但此次聽到了這消息，非常興奮，竟毅然踏出了鐵絲網而帶回來這些紀念品……」那老先生很是健談，精神也矍鑠得很。筆者更在園中走了一圈，眼見得那些龍柏，紅楓，垂枝梅等等，栽植得井井有條，更有那成千株的牡丹，將來開花時，　有可觀，聽說有一種黃牡丹，非常名貴。於是和老先生的了一個賞牡丹的佳期，將來定要前去一廣眼界。他老人家在眞如本有數百畝的種植塲，規模極大，而聽說最近開幕的張園，其中樹木部分也完全是眞如種植塲中的出品，由他公子德鄰先生一手包辦而佈置的；這樣的魄力，眞是使人佩服。</p>

<h3 id="c80">駡人的藝術 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 小木風</p>
<p>據說：駡人也有藝術。</p>
<p>我是傻子，我可不能理會得這句話的意義於是，老張又自吿奮勇地解釋給我聽。</p>
<p>「譬如，」他一本正經地說，「譬如你與一個境况和你差不多的同事在一起談話，大家訴說着生活的苦况，怨恨百物騰貴和收入絲毫沒有增加。那時候，你若拍拍你同事的臂膀，親密地鄭重地對他說——</p>
<p>他媽的這小器鬼科長！津貼老不加，叫我們吃什麼？喝空氣！暍風！看他這樣小器，永做不出大事來！…倘使你老兄做了這個科長，哼！那大家都有活路了！不是嗎？你老兄向來寬容大量！</p>
<p>——你說着，還得帶着笑，說到後來，還得向他豎起大拇指。那，那你的同事準會大樂，他會跟着你笑！」老張說到這兒停住了，透了一口氣。</p>
<p>可是，我仍舊茫然，這跟「駡人也有藝術」這句話有什麼關係呢？</p>
<p>老張看見我一副糊塗的臉色，知道我還沒有瞭然。於是，他先向我扮了個鬼臉，然後露出了他的鑲金牙，噴着口水，向我講：</p>
<p>「老弟，你還不懂嗎？你駡了科長，又拍了你同事的馬屁，不是一舉兩得？倘使你單駡科長，那太危險。萬一你同事跟你搗蛋，到科長那兒去戳你壁脚，那你，那你…，你自己總懂得。現在，你拍了他的馬屁，他就不會背後跟你搗蛋了，而你自己呢，駡過後，也總算出了一口惡氣…」老張是「大塊子」，說得接不上氣來，我眞有點憐惜他，因為他誠懇地敎我「駡人的藝術」；他還接着說：</p>
<p>「而且，…而且在另一方面講，你也駡了那同事，駡了他，他還架，還跟着你笑，覺得你拍了他馬屁！」老張竟然張口大笑了，我還望見了他那隻鑲金牙的旁邊牙縫裏，有一小片靑的菜葉。</p>
<p>我更加茫然了。</p>
<p>老張停住了大笑，又是一個鬼臉，再拍拍我的肩頭，說</p>
<p>「老弟，你怎麼不懂？你的同事不是跟你一樣地一個小職員，又不是科長，也…也永不會做科長…你這樣說，不是也駡了他，駡了他嗎？而他還樂！」老張又笑了，笑得抽不過氣來。</p>
<p>我也跟着他笑了。但是，即刻我又覺得糊塗起來……我忍不住問老張說：</p>
<p>「這就是駡人藝術嗎？但，但我們店裏却沒那勞什子的科長呀！」</p>
<p>老張笑得更烈了，倒在沙發上立不起來。</p>
<p>「你眞是傻子！」最後老張硬勁忍住了笑聲，這樣說。</p>
<p>我也覺得自己眞有點儍，弄了大半天還弄不明白這幾個字的意思。我只好報那辛苦的老張以一笑。忽然，我想起了，老張駡我「儍子」我却還對他笑。「他媽的！這就是駡人的藝術！」我想。</p>

<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>「你要吃什麼東西不要？」</p>
<p>秋海棠自己雖不是個胖子，却也知道食物和胖子的關係。一天四餐，在趙叫是萬萬不能少的，尤其在需要他充跑腿的時候，吃飽更是第一要件，便不待他冉說，忙招呼茶房去做二十鍋貼帶下一碗大肉麵來。</p>
<p>趙四道才不打呵欠了。</p>
<p>「三爺這件事，聽說做得很有趣，倒像是一齣玩笑戲，你難道沒有聽七爺說過嗎？」在等候麵和鍋貼的時候，趙四突然這樣沒頭沒腦地問。</p>
<p>「什麼事？」</p>
<p>「他娶天津這一位姨太太的事，你沒有知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有。」秋海棠絲毫不感興趣地說。</p>
<p>「據一個朋友吿訴我，」趙四倒是最歡喜管人家的閒事。「這個女人壓根兒是給三爺騙來的！」</p>
<p>秋海棠只冷冷地一笑。他雖然沒有知道這會事，但憑袁寳藩道個人平日的行為來揣測，那裏會有幹不出道種勾當的？騙還算跟人家客氣，逢到高興時，搶也得搶咧！</p>
<p>「對親的時候，聽說用的是七爺的照相。」</p>
<p>「七爺的照相？」這倒很使秋海棠覺得奇怪了！因為他是知道袁紹文的性格的，深信他無論怎樣，也不致給他叔叔做幫兇。</p>
<p>「眞不眞我也不知道。」趙叫把腦袋探向門外去張了一張，奇怪鍋貼和麵為什麼還沒有來。「只是聽人家說，那個女人很厲害，是個女學生，後來跟　爺吵得翻江擾海，抵死不肯干休。七爺也怪　爺不是，當晚就溜回北京去，不願冉替他調停。還虧這裏的胡督軍跟好些做官的人，竭力排解，才把事情平了下去；結果三爺還依了她三件大事，想必不回北京去跟大太太同住，一定也是那樣講定的了！」</p>
<p>「這樣說來，七爺的照片大概也是給三爺騙去的。」秋海棠點點頭說。</p>
<p>「着啊！」趙四也忙順着他的口氣說：「七爺這個人，論起來比三爺倒要正經得多咧！」</p>

<p>退一步言，即使這樣，究竟還可以「苟延」一下的；然總無過於「扼喉撫背」者……</p>
<p>易經上說：「剝床以膚，切近災也。」今巳跡近「剝膚」之痛，又安得置若罔聞而讓人來「剝」耶？</p>

<p>Chongqing The Second National Political Conference is being held at an undisclosed location here. It opened on Saturday and lasted for a long time. The closed-door meeting resumed this morning. At the opening, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Lin Sen both delivered speeches. Out of the 240 members of the conference, 190 attended the opening ceremony. The conference is being held in an auditorium. The entire area is heavily guarded by military police and police. Except for vehicles of government officials, representatives of the conference, journalists, and a few others specially permitted, all other traffic is completely cut off. During the opening ceremony, the audience sang the national anthem and the party anthem, and bowed three times to the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China. Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the president of Nankai University and Chairman of the Conference, Zhang Boling, and Minister of Propaganda, Dr. Wang Shijie, stood on the stage. Chairman Lin delivered a welcoming speech to the representatives. The key points of his speech were threefold: first, the whole country should unite; second, the requirements for national defense construction should be put forward; and third, a description of the reports of the representatives after inspecting various war zones. Chairman Lin said that these reports are of great benefit to the government. At the same time, he asked the representatives to put forward more proposals related to construction. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Strive for Final Victory; Complete Secure National Defense</p>
<p>Chongqing At the opening ceremony of the National Political Conference yesterday morning, Chairman Lin delivered an address, first praising the past achievements of the conference, and then expressing hopes for this session: (1) Spiritual unity to support unification; as long as it is beneficial to the country and the nation, everything should be sacrificed to strive for final victory; (2) The war at the front is already under control, and the construction in the rear needs more suggestions from the councilors to the government; (3) The councilors have extensive contact with various localities and overseas and should convey the actual situation to the government as much as possible, and at the same time explain the various facilities of the central government to the people, so as to infuse the emotions between the two. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek then spoke, and after describing the internal and external situations, solemnly explained the improvement of China's diplomatic situation, saying that although Japan is trying to take advantage of opportunities, friendly countries are increasing their aid to China. The unity of all countries related to the Pacific is becoming Japan's greatest panic and the greatest force for maintaining world peace. Although the European war is at risk of expansion, it is actually beneficial to China's resistance. The goal of China's resistance and construction is very simple, that is, the war must strive for the final victory, and the nation-building must achieve absolute national defense security. (All councilors applauded these two sentences.) As for the ways to achieve this, (1) In the political aspect, left-leaning and right-leaning should no longer exist. All parties and factions should take the construction of safe national defense and the defense of the country as the only goal and work together; (2) National defense construction must be industrialized for national defense and national defense for industry, and should echo and advance with military construction to improve national defense strength; (3) In the economic aspect, efforts should be made to lay the foundation for national defense, which must be absolutely safe whether in wartime or after the war; (4) Educational and cultural facilities should also be centered on and based on national defense. All citizens must reduce their personal lives to the minimum and strive to increase their public lives to the maximum. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Speech; Enthusiastic Applause from All</p>
<p>Chongqing At the opening ceremony of the National Political Conference yesterday morning, 189 councilors attended. Zhang Boling served as temporary chairman. Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen personally attended and delivered instructions, which was the first time since the establishment of the conference. Then, Chiang Kai-shek spoke for thirty minutes. In the middle, he stated that the goal of China's nation-building was to strive for the final victory and complete a safe national defense. His tone was particularly powerful and won enthusiastic applause from all. The councilors elected Zhou Daogang, the leader of the Sichuan army, to respond. The opening ceremony ended there. According to the agenda, the preparatory meeting should have been held next to elect the presidium, and the first plenary session should have been held in the afternoon to listen to reports on foreign affairs and economy. However, more than 40 people, including Zhang Junmai and Huang Yanpei, made a temporary motion to postpone both meetings to this morning. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing At the first plenary session of the National Political Conference held secretly this morning, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and Economic Minister Weng Wenhao will give separate reports on international and economic matters. The presidium elected this morning includes Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Boling, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, and Ms. Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's College. Out of the 188 votes cast, Chiang Kai-shek received 186 votes alone. Chiang Kai-shek serves as the Chairman, and Zhang Boling serves as the Vice-Speaker, taking turns to preside over the meeting. A total of 201 representatives have registered. In addition to Mao Zedong, all Communist representatives are also included, but none of the Communist representatives attended the meetings yesterday and today. The National Political Conference is the most democratic institution in wartime China for expressing public opinion. The conference was established on July 6, 1938, when the government was still in Hankou. Four plenary sessions were held in Hankou. The first plenary session held in Chongqing was on April 10, 1940. The session of the National Political Conference was originally scheduled for October last year, before the convening of the First National Political Conference was completed. However, due to transportation difficulties and the election of the Central Executive Committee, which was not completed, the conference scheduled for November 12, 1940, was delayed. The list of the conference has also been expanded from 200 to 240 people. The names of these councilors were announced on December 23. This afternoon, Chairman Lin will host a banquet for all the councilors at the Jialing Apartments. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing Representatives from Shanghai, Nanjing, the three northeastern provinces, and other occupied areas are also attending the National Political Conference being held here. Representatives from Mongolia and Tibet are wearing Mongolian and Tibetan costumes. When the meeting was held last autumn, it was held in the auditorium of Chongqing University. This time, it is being held in the newly built National Assembly Hall, which can accommodate 2,200 people, so the representatives were surprised when they were taken to the venue.

<p>Chongqing The Japanese side has repeatedly claimed that 20,000 Chinese troops have entered Burma and that 6,000 Chinese troops have gone to Singapore, as if they had witnessed it themselves. A military spokesperson recently issued a responsible statement, saying that such malicious propaganda by the Japanese side is intended to confuse the world and is not worth a single inch. It should be known that Burma is Burma for the Burmese and is ruled by the British. Without the consent of both the central and Burmese governments, how can they arbitrarily enter Burmese territory? The British side has repeatedly stated that they are able to cope with any events in the Far East in the Malay Peninsula and Burma, so why would they need the southern assistance of the Chinese army? Therefore, the central government has long denied this, and the Japanese side has also made a public announcement, which is enough to prove that the previous rumors were unfounded. However, the Japanese are accustomed to using the technique of provocation and discord. The Chinese, British, and Burmese people should pay close attention to their intentions. (Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e8">After the Forced Submission of France and Vietnam Again <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The once extremely tense Thai-Vietnamese dispute was resolved by the Vichy government's decision at a meeting on the 28th to accept Japan's "mediation" proposal. Although the conditions have not yet been officially announced and the final result is pending negotiations in Tokyo, it is generally undoubtedly another submission by France and Vietnam. The expansion of the war between Thailand and Vietnam, which the world was worried about a few days ago, is unlikely to materialize. The Thai side, which is determined to seize territory, and Japan, which is using coercion for mediation, will both feel hesitant and satisfied with this. Only France and Vietnam, after exhausting their efforts to support themselves, finally succumbed to internal and external environments and various difficulties and had to make the tragic scene of the division of Vietnamese territory after the Hanoi Agreement last autumn. The situation faced by the French and Vietnamese authorities, who are in the midst of the storm, is indeed more serious and complicated than last autumn, but we cannot help but regret that they have failed to maintain their position from beginning to end. However, the importance of this issue does not lie in Thailand and Vietnam themselves, but in its relationship with the entire South Pacific situation. Now that the territorial dispute between the two sides has been slightly resolved, its future evolution is still uncertain. The theory of yesterday has already started, and now we invite you to give your full view.</p>
<p>The so-called Thai-Vietnamese territorial dispute, in essence, is only similar to the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America seven or eight years ago; but because of the complexity of the environment and background, it has formed an important part of today's crisis in the Far East, which is tightly grasped by the invaders to build a springboard for their southward invasion. If Japan cannot seize strategic strongholds on this peninsula, it is difficult to imagine that it can fight more than a thousand miles away from its rear base, regardless of whether its future main force for the southward invasion will rely on the navy, the army, or the air force. If the occupation of Hainan Island is the "19181" of the Pacific, then the directing and even "mediating" of the events from the Hanoi affair last autumn to the recent Thai-Vietnamese dispute is no different from the various aggressive arrangements on the eve of the "August 13th" incident; if there is no further hindrance and it is allowed to do whatever it wants, then when the time is right, the outbreak of future incidents in the South Pacific will be as inevitable as water flowing into a canal; how can Thailand and Vietnam be able to achieve temporary completeness because the territorial dispute is resolved! It is expected that soon, France and Vietnam will discover that their repeated submissions are only inviting more covetousness and coercion; even if the Thai side feels satisfied with the fulfillment of its territorial desires, it will eventually find that it is no different from swallowing a poisonous bait, and endless troubles will follow this "restoration movement," and finally be dragged into the South Pacific war that it has initiated and be unable to extricate itself. Thailand, Vietnam, and the relevant powers should all bear considerable responsibility for the creation of this unfortunate future; on the other hand, Japan's use of it is quite skillful. For example, for France and Vietnam, it uses its isolated and unguarded position to exert severe coercion; for the Thai side, it deliberately pleases them, even at the expense of being generous to others, exchanging Vietnamese territory for Thai goodwill; this is nothing more than expecting France and Vietnam to be unable to do anything in the end, while Thailand is approaching India and Burma. If Thailand is coerced, it will turn to unite with Britain. It is precisely because of this that they can use the tactics of picking sides to direct and control between the two countries.</p>
<p>However, what Japan has already completed is only a prelude to the operation of this Indochina Peninsula, and its theme is how to extract benefits from both sides as a reward, which is also an important key to completing the southward invasion steps. How this request will proceed, there are only various speculations and rumors so far, whether the conditions for asking for a reward were proposed at the beginning of the "mediation" and a tacit agreement was obtained, or whether it is to ask for a reward from both sides after the "mediation" has achieved results, there is a lack of reliable reports. However, judging from the fact that both Thailand and Vietnam have readily accepted Japan's "mediation," it seems that the latter assumption is closer to the truth. However, the so-called mediation is meritorious to Thailand, but only generates resentment to Vietnam; moreover, after more than a month of time and several twists and turns, recently France and Vietnam accepted its "proposal" in extreme reluctance and anger due to their inability to resist, then if they further ask for a reward, it can be expected that its progress will be more difficult than the mediation process, which is precisely the result that Japan will inevitably get from favoring Thailand and suppressing France and Vietnam. If no new changes occur internationally, Japan may not be able to achieve everything easily in Vietnam. There are many new and similar precedents internationally: one is Hungary and Bulgaria, which relied on the Nazis to demand land and immediately joined the Axis powers, and the other is Spain, which has received great benefits from Germany and Italy and still maintains its independent stance; will Thailand emulate Hungary and Bulgaria, or will it take France as an example in Spain? This is the touchstone of the insight and courage of the Thai authorities. Originally, its demand for land from France and Vietnam was exposing its imprudence, but now it has reached the critical juncture of the survival of the name and reality of sovereignty, so it should be able to make careful considerations.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, Japan was clamoring and anxious because the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations were stranded, complaining and blaming others. From these manifestations, it is obvious that it still lacks full confidence in controlling Thailand and Vietnam; it is only because Thailand and Vietnam cannot trust and understand each other, and the relevant powers are watching from the sidelines, that Japan was able to complete the direction. With the offensive of the European invasion, the evolution of the South Pacific will soon reach an important stage, and every step of the development of the Indochina Peninsula will become every crucial prologue in it; it is hoped that all parties concerned can learn valuable lessons from the past mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Weekly War Situation February 22nd to March 1st <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, discussed the war situation of the past week as follows:</p>
<p>Hubei &amp; Hunan</p>
<p>On the Hubei-Hunan front, Japanese troops at Cenhekou in central Hubei were counter-attacked by Chinese forces on the morning of the 19th, suffering considerable casualties. The remaining Japanese set fire to Zifu Temple, and retreated northward amidst the smoke and fire. After capturing Zifu Temple, Chinese forces pursued the Japanese, successively capturing Panzhang Bridge and other places, directly threatening the southern suburbs of Shashi. Another unit of Chinese forces circled to the vicinity of Caoshi north of Shashi, simultaneously launching a fierce attack on the Japanese troops. Japanese officer Hayasaka was wounded. Japanese troops northeast of Yichang harassed Jigongshan on the evening of the 18th, suffering losses and retreating in defeat. Over a thousand Japanese troops at Nanfengkou in Mianyang suffered considerable losses after being counter-attacked by Chinese forces and are currently engaged in fierce fighting at Hongsha Temple. On the 26th, a unit of Japanese troops attacked Jiankou and were intercepted by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties. On the night of the 20th, a certain unit of Chinese forces northwest of Jiangling City was attacked, and much was captured. The Japanese troops are now entrenched within the city, defending to the death. Jiangling is under Chinese attack. The mercenary leader Li Zhi was killed by Chinese forces north of the city on the 16th (previous reports that Li was executed by Japanese troops were inaccurate). On the afternoon of the 19th, over a thousand Japanese troops from Tongshan, with four cannons, attacked Huangjiajian, Chengshan, Hengcen, and other places. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, they ultimately failed to succeed. On the morning of the 21st, they launched a large-scale reinforcement and even briefly broke into the east gate of Chengshan and Xinshi. Chinese forces launched a fierce counter-attack, and by 5 PM, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated to Nanlin Bridge and other places in Tongshan. In this battle, over five hundred Japanese troops were killed, and many firearms and military supplies were captured. On the 20th, Chinese forces attacked Shibisi, Tieluchong, Weijiacen and other places around Tongcheng. After half a day of fierce fighting, all the fortifications at Shibisi were destroyed, eliminating over two hundred Japanese troops and destroying four Japanese military vehicles. Japanese troops at Lengjiawen on the Yuehan Railway were attacked by Chinese forces on the evening of the 17th, suffering heavy casualties, and two engineering vehicles were blown up. The next morning, another Japanese train was destroyed by landmines, causing significant losses in personnel and supplies. On the same day, another unit of Chinese forces attacked the Japanese strongholds at Yangguan and Xiongjiawo southeast of Yueyang, achieving considerable gains.</p>
<p>Jiangxi &amp; Guangdong</p>
<p>On the Jiangxi-Guangdong front, on the 19th, a unit of Japanese troops advanced southward via Changshe and were ambushed by Chinese forces near Dashaping. The Japanese retreated northward, suffering heavy losses. The remaining Japanese fled towards Zhenhuatang. In this battle, over two hundred Japanese corpses were left behind. Japanese troops near Pengze attempted to cross Taibai Lake at dawn on the 20th to attack Rongjiajiao. Chinese forces waited until they were halfway across before launching a fierce attack. Many Japanese soldiers fell into the water, and four Japanese boats were sunk. The remnants fled. At the same time, Japanese troops east of Malukou attacked the vicinity of Maozishan and were repelled by Chinese forces after fierce fighting lasting for some time. In the Danshui area of eastern Guangdong, the fighting this week was more intense. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and reinforced several times, but were all defeated. Chinese forces have captured Huangsha Broken Temple and are currently expanding their gains.</p>
<p>Shanxi &amp; Suiyuan</p>
<p>On the Shanxi-Suiyuan front, on the 25th, over two thousand Japanese troops from Heilongguan, Jindianzhen, Liucun and other places in western Shanxi simultaneously attacked Tianjiagou and Yukou. They were wiped out from both sides by Chinese forces. At dawn on the 19th, Japanese troops from the Suiyuan border attacked Enqibei in over twenty vehicles, with over ten artillery pieces, dividing into three routes. After fierce fighting until evening, reinforcements arrived from Xuchuangfen. The next morning, Chinese forces launched a fierce counter-attack, causing heavy Japanese casualties. The remnants fled back, abandoning many bullets. Enqibei remains in Chinese hands.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>On other fronts, (1) Chinese forces in southern Henan continued to capture strongholds such as Paoma Rock, killing over a hundred Japanese troops. The Japanese fled to Changtaiguan. (2) The Japanese airfield in Xinxiang was destroyed by Chinese forces, destroying two aircraft and burning down the military supplies depot near the railway station. (3) Japanese troops, who were encircled and annihilated by Chinese forces at Zheche northwest of Chaoxian, escaped to Daozigang on the night of the 18th. On the 19th, they sent reinforcements to Cuozhen east of Hefei and attacked Zheche again. After about four hours of fierce fighting, they fled westward in different directions. At this time, another unit of Chinese forces entered Qingxizhen in Chaoxian, and another unit shelled Dianbu east of Hefei, destroying many Japanese barracks, killing over seven hundred Japanese troops and capturing five artillery pieces, firearms, ammunition and other military supplies. (4) In various parts of northern Shandong, there were seventeen battles of varying sizes this week, killing or wounding over two thousand Japanese officers and soldiers and capturing many rifles, helmets and other military supplies. (5) Chinese guerrilla forces in the townships of Nantong, Haimen, Jingjiang, Gaoyou, Jiangdu and other places are becoming increasingly active.

<h3 id="e12">Rumor that Vichy has Accepted Japanese Mediation Terms, Ceding Five Border Areas to Thailand, Ambassador to Japan will Submit Reply <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: Today's news, the Vichy government has agreed to cede provinces in Laos and Cambodia of Vietnam to Thailand, because the government has accepted the Japanese mediation plan. The plan insists on ceding the provinces in the aforementioned areas to Thailand. This decision of the French government was decided by the cabinet last night. There are five provinces to be ceded, one is the entire area of Luang Prabang and Pakse (both transliterations) in the Lao region west of the Mekong River, the entire province of Siem Reap (transliteration) in the northwest of Cambodia, most of Battambang (transliteration), and Kampong Thom (transliteration) province. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Reliable neutral sources claimed last night that fifty Japanese residents had left Hanoi for Haiphong yesterday afternoon. However, sources familiar with the matter believe that the claim by Japanese in Tokyo that Vichy has accepted the terms of Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute may be true. Most observers believe that accepting the terms is the only solution, because France's military strength is too weak to fight against the Japanese-Thai allied forces. At the same time, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux refused to meet with local people, and other government officials remained silent and unwilling to explain. (United Press Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency Vichy telegram stated that French sources claimed that the French reply to the Japanese mediation proposal, transmitted by French Ambassador to Japan Henri, could be considered an approval, but there are still some points that France needs to clarify. It is said that the nature of the reply is to open the possibility of continued negotiations and to show a peaceful resolution of the dispute. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Vichy: The government's attitude towards the Thai-Vietnamese dispute has been decided in principle at yesterday's State Council meeting, and a brief communiqué was issued afterwards, mentioning that semi-official sources will soon publish a document specifically explaining France's position. However, responsible officials here refuse to add anything to this. In short, the government's view before yesterday's State Council meeting was that it did not recognize that Thailand's various demands had sufficient legal basis. Although France expressed a spirit of compromise in the Tokyo negotiations, it may not have changed this legal view. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese semi-official sources claim that, judging from foreign news, the Vichy government's attitude towards Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute is trending towards moderation. Therefore, it is expected that French Ambassador to Japan Henri will meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka today. Sources familiar with the matter believe that the French reply will be more moderate than before, especially regarding the issue of returning western Cambodia. It is said that French Ambassador Henri was originally scheduled to meet with Matsuoka on March 1, but it was cancelled in order to study Vichy's instructions and request further clarification from his government. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a telegram from a correspondent in Vietnam carried in yesterday's "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the entire French Far East Fleet returned to Saigon yesterday. According to reports, the fleet suddenly left Saigon on the 23rd of [Month missing] in an attempt to intimidate the ongoing Thai-Vietnamese peace talks. The return of the fleet to Saigon is believed to be Petain's expression of willingness to adopt a more amicable attitude towards Japan's involvement in the Thai-Vietnamese war. (Haitong Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The current French ambassador to Japan, Henri, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka for an hour today. The French ambassador seems to have explained in detail to the Japanese foreign minister the French response to the conditions for resolving the Thai-Vietnamese dispute proposed by Japan. Although Vichy news carried in yesterday's newspapers said that the French government had basically accepted the Japanese conditions, the Japanese government does not seem to have received formal notification from the French government before the French ambassador's visit to Matsuoka today. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News published an article stating that the permanent and satisfactory solution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute does not depend on whether France accepts Japan's mediation proposal, but on whether Thailand and Vietnam can engage in direct negotiations without foreign interference to resolve all disputes. The United Kingdom and the United States cannot stand idly by regarding the development of South Vietnam, because once Japan's position in Thailand and Vietnam is consolidated, Japan's second step will be to attack Burma and Singapore. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States should take action as soon as possible to avoid being too late. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>New York: Associated Press News, according to General Commander Bai Beisu of the Dutch East Indies, the number of troops in the Dutch East Indies has increased several times. Previously, the troops were only concentrated in Java and Sumatra, but currently the Dutch troops have been sent to defend naval bases on the islands between Borneo and New Guinea. The future increase in troops depends on the transportation of military supplies. At present, the transportation of military supplies is very slow. The Dutch East Indies is determined to defend its territory and all its islands. (Tass, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rangoon: According to the newspaper's announcement, in order to preserve all steel within Burma, export licenses for steel will only be issued under very special circumstances, because countries that produce steel also have a great increase in demand for steel. The announcement stated that India is a steel-producing country, but Burma is not. Although exports to India are not currently prohibited, if Burma's steel reserves are exhausted as a result, it would not be beneficial to Burma. Therefore, merchants are advised to limit their sales to India to no more than the original pre-war quantities. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Washington: Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky assured Deputy Secretary of State Welles yesterday that goods shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union are being used exclusively by the Soviet Union. According to British government officials, they had previously complained to the United States that American goods were leaking into Germany from the Soviet Union, and that the Soviet Union, even if it did not directly ship American goods to Germany, was using American goods to fill the gaps. Oumansky's guarantee was issued in response to this. (United Press, 2nd)</p>

At the same time, the US Navy can also have 15,000 aircraft of various types. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

According to news from London, the British government has empowered the ambassador to Bulgaria, Rendel, to assess the situation and sever relations with Bulgaria at any time.

<p>Bulgarian Capital: German army corps strengthened their control over major parts of Bulgaria this morning. German engineers are installing coastal artillery in Varna, intending to bombard British ships entering the Dardanelles. German officers and technicians occupied private houses and villas, while troops were stationed in schools and town halls. The Bulgarian capital has been officially declared a demilitarized city. No one is allowed to leave the city without a pass. The German headquarters are located forty miles southeast of the city. The Bulgarian capital has imposed a strict blackout order. The German military has complete control over radio stations, railways, highways, docks, etc. Large German armies are moving along the coast, apparently establishing a major outpost on the Black Sea border of neighboring countries.

German motorized units also arrived in the Bulgarian capital at 5 PM today. In addition, German troops have been seen in cities such as Varna, Vidin, and Ruse in Bulgaria. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Bulgarian Capital: Fully armed German troops, ready for war, controlled Sofia last night. They entered various parts of Bulgaria on armored trains, trains, and troop carriers, apparently heading towards the northeastern border of Greece. Knowing that Bulgaria had joined the Axis pact in the Vienna Conference two hours ago, helmeted German troops entered the Bulgarian capital in armored vehicles. Yesterday, the skies over the Bulgarian capital were filled with German aircraft. When the Brownshirts crossed the bridges across the Danube from Romania to Bulgaria, they were escorted by large numbers of German bombers and fighters. The Bulgarian government was quite alarmed. The crowds on the streets of the Bulgarian capital watched silently as the German troops paraded by. The speed of the German troops' entry into Bulgaria exceeded their expectations. Senior officials have been hotly speculating as to whether the German troops will immediately attack Greece or simply deploy in Bulgaria, but because the general direction of the German troops is towards the Greek border, the theory that they will soon attack Greece seems more reasonable.

It is believed that the Germans, who have already occupied Bulgaria, will not attack Greece for the time being before attempting to use Yugoslavia to mediate the Greek-Italian war. Political circles here all believe that Greece's rejection of the Axis powers' proposed conditions for resolving the Greek-Italian war will inevitably lead to Germany's blitzkrieg advancing to the Thessaloniki area. Most diplomats believe that Yugoslavia can no longer safely remain outside the Axis powers. (International News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to observations from foreign diplomatic circles, Bulgaria's joining of the Tripartite Pact at a time when the Balkan situation is critical will be regarded by the Axis powers as a response to the recent talks between the United Kingdom and Turkey in Ankara. As for the claim that German troops have arrived in the Bulgarian capital, although it has not been officially confirmed, it is a natural result of Bulgaria joining the Tripartite Pact, because at this moment the Axis powers are actually expanding their first line of defense as much as possible. In addition, it can be asserted that if the United Kingdom or Turkey take any aggressive actions, the Axis powers will immediately respond. For example, if British troops land in Greece, Germany will definitely take action. The intention is nothing more than to warn the United Kingdom not to interfere in the Balkan Peninsula war. In short, Greece is now isolated. As a result of the current situation's evolution, that country will have to give greater consideration to the proposal for a separate peace with Italy, which is not necessarily impossible.

<p>Germany Completes Military Deployment, Possibly a Prelude to Aiding Italy in Attacking Greece</p>
<p>Vichy: After the German troops entered Bulgaria, observers here generally believe that this move may not immediately produce any military consequences. In particular, the border area between Bulgaria and Greece is not only mostly mountainous, but also is located north of the Greek port of Thessaloniki. After the German troops arrive on the Bulgarian border, they will have a commanding position, which will inevitably have a significant impact on future military operations. Since the United Kingdom has won successive victories in Africa, its military position on the Aegean coast has also gained an advantage as a result. However, it will be difficult to maintain this advantage in the future, because until the end of the month, the British troops' target in the Balkans was only the Italian army, which was travelling far by sea and threatened by the British fleet. In the future, they will have to confront the German army directly. According to estimates by The Times of London, the entire strength of the German army is no less than 225 divisions, of which 13 are armored divisions and 10 are motorized units. There are 500,000 officers in the Lower Danube region. Although these troops are scattered in Romania and Bulgaria, resulting in long transportation lines, their defenses are far from the coast, so they can be free from the trouble of the British fleet. This is probably another reason why German troops can operate more easily than Italian troops. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia is Isolated, Germany Implements Terror Tactics against Yugoslavia</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital City: The Germans are currently adopting terror tactics against Yugoslavia. Today, German bombers flew over the area of Skopje, but one of them was forced to land by Yugoslav fighters. Seven German aircraft also violated Yugoslav territory opposite Gevgelija. Yugoslav guards opened fire with machine guns, forcing them to retreat towards Romania. Yugoslavia has deployed anti-aircraft artillery positions at important locations in the Danube region. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Vienna: After Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact, people generally worry that the country will actively assist the Axis powers. However, some political observers here believe that the country may not immediately implement the pact, because Article 3 of the pact stipulates that other signatory countries will only provide assistance if one signatory country is subjected to "attack by countries that are not currently at war." Since the United Kingdom is already a belligerent country, this clause cannot be applied according to legal principles. Therefore, the so-called mutual assistance treaty must wait until Turkey takes aggressive action before it can be invoked. However, most observers do not believe that Turkey will take any sudden action and strongly assert that the country's diplomatic activities have historically been inclined towards peace rather than war. On this basis, the importance of the Tripartite Pact lies not in its theoretical application, but in its spiritual influence. As for Bulgaria, its joining the pact is nothing less than declaring that it will abandon its consistent policy of refusing to participate in any pact and cautiously making friends with all countries. Looking at the Balkan Peninsula today, Yugoslavia is the only country that has not entered into any treaty relationship with the belligerent countries. However, it is questionable whether this isolated attitude can be maintained for a long time. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>If Turkey's Security is Threatened, it is Prepared to Fight Shoulder to Shoulder with the UK</p>
<p>Ankara: The news of the German troops entering Bulgaria has sent shockwaves through Ankara. A Turkish government spokesperson said yesterday that if war breaks out in the Balkans as a result and Turkey's security is threatened, then Turkey may be forced to fight shoulder to shoulder with the UK. This statement was made after British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of Staff Dill left Turkey, and after Eden and Dill had agreed with Turkish leaders on a joint political, diplomatic, and military plan, they departed from Turkey for Cairo. (International News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Ankara: There is not much surprise here about Bulgaria's participation in the Tripartite Pact, and it is regarded as Germany's response to British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Ankara. The Turkish cabinet convened a meeting to review the results of Eden's visit. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Istanbul: It is heard that the Turkish naval authorities have issued an order that all ships intending to pass through the Dardanelles Strait must report their identities to the authorities in the future and request the assignment of a pilot. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Moscow – The eighth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded successfully on March 1st. The Chairman of the People’s Committee of Finance of the Soviet Union, Zverev, delivered a speech on behalf of the People’s Committee, stating that the Soviet government agreed to the proposed amendments to the 1941 budget by the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities. It was decided to increase revenue by 990 million rubles and expenditures by 17.3 million rubles. Zverev continued, saying that the People’s Committee of the Soviet Union believed that the proposals of the delegates to increase economic and cultural expenditures in various states and regions should be immediately approved. An additional 6.6 million rubles should be allocated for industrial construction in Latvia, 1.5 million rubles for municipal construction in Tashkent, and construction funds for Ukraine, Armenia, and other states. After the above amendments, Zverev proposed approving the 1941 Soviet budget, with estimated revenue of 216,840,224,000 rubles and expenditures of 216,520,134,000 rubles, including 70,865,000,000 rubles for the Red Army and Navy. Subsequently, the chairmen of the Budget Committees of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities delivered speeches, thanking the Soviet government for its concern for various states and regions and supporting Zverev's proposal, requesting approval of the budget and all amendments. The two houses voted in succession, and the budget was unanimously approved. At this point, everyone stood up and cheered. When the national defense budget was passed, everyone applauded even more enthusiastically. In addition to approving the 1941 budget, the following items were also approved at the meeting: (1) the Collective Farm Income Tax Law and amendments to agricultural taxes; (2) an amendment to several articles of the Soviet Constitution regarding the renaming of the Aikemen district to the Isimo district; (3) the establishment of the People's State Management Committee; (4) the division of the People's Internal Affairs Committee into two departments; (5) the decrees promulgated by the Presidium since the seventh session of the Supreme Soviet.

The elected were the chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of Moldova, including Lobovko, and the chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of the Baltic republics: Barrykists (Lithuania), Kojistans (Latvia), and Valres (Estonia). In addition, based on the proposal of Belarusian delegates, Volkov was removed from his position as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet due to other assignments, and Ponomarenko was appointed as his successor. At this point, the agenda of the conference had been discussed and completed, and it was declared a successful conclusion. (1st, TASS)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Japan Coerces Vietnam to Cede Land with Threatening Posture; Guarantee of Territorial Integrity Is Empty Words; Thailand Invites the Wolf into the House, Future Is Worrying; Renowned Commentator Woodhead Writes an Article Discussing This <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Renowned commentator Woodhead published an article in the English-language Greater American Weekly yesterday, commenting on Japan's handling of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, stating that the attention of people in the Far East has been entirely focused on the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and Japan's mediation over the past week. Japan is forcing Vietnam to cede land to Thailand at any cost, even proposing conditions that Vichy cannot accept, setting a deadline for a reply, and ordering Japanese residents in Vietnam to prepare to evacuate, while amassing large numbers of land and naval forces near Vietnam. Under these circumstances, Vietnam can only be forced to accept Japan's proposals. This kind of power politics is already commonplace in Europe. Therefore, there is no need to be surprised if the third axis follows the old tricks of Hitler and Mussolini. If we are not forgetful, we should recall that a few months ago, Japan guaranteed to Vietnam that it would respect the territorial integrity of Vietnam. Recently, Japanese politicians have repeatedly stated that Japan has no intention of using force anywhere in East Asia. Such remarks are not surprising, because any Axis country must make such remarks before engaging in aggression. Thailand takes advantage of the situation and relies on the assistance of other countries to engage in aggression, thinking it is a good plan, but does not realize that it has already been incorporated into the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It has invited the wolf into the house. Although it has gained some land, it has already lost something more important. One does not need to be a wise man to know what has been gained and lost. Is Thailand the Bulgaria of the Far East?</p>
<p>Economic Constraints Faced by Vietnam</p>
<p>Renowned economic commentator A. Arlander published an article in the English-language Greater American Weekly yesterday, commenting on Japan's economic advance into the South, stating that Japan hopes that countries in East Asia can voluntarily participate in its so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." However, after witnessing the Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Dutch economic negotiations, various countries have a good understanding of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and lack enthusiasm for voluntary participation. When Japan negotiated with Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, it made it clear that it had no intention of implementing the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and its purpose was only to obtain unilateral benefits without offering any goods in exchange.</p>
<p>Applying Political and Military Pressure Simultaneously</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to force Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies to accept its demands, it spared no effort in using political and military pressure. When Vietnam negotiated with Japan, Japanese troops had already invaded, and Japanese warships were patrolling along the coast and the lower reaches of the Mekong River, so its situation was not as good as that of the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies is still outside the sphere of Japanese influence, and its defense is more solid. Therefore, it can adhere to certain principles when conducting economic negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>Vietnam Yields and Is at Its Mercy</p>
<p>Vietnam's situation is different; it is almost entirely at Japan's mercy. Nineteen out of twenty major demands made by the Japanese have already been accepted. As evidenced by the economic agreement established between Vietnam and Japan in East Asia on January 20, Vietnam has made every effort to satisfy Japan economically. Japan has the right to prioritize the most important economic resources of Vietnam. According to recent news from Saigon, Vietnam will supply Japan with 700,000 tons of rice this year (accounting for one-third of Japan's foreign rice imports), and 15,000 tons of rubber (accounting for one-third of Vietnam's rubber exports and one-half of Japan's import needs). In addition, Vietnam will also supply Japan with large quantities of corn, coal, phosphorus, and limestone.</p>
<p>Fulfilling Obligations by Restricting Exports</p>
<p>In order to fulfill its obligations to Japan, Vietnam has adopted many special measures. For example, since last month, Saigon rice exports have been subject to export bans, and except for those transported to Japan and France, they may not be transported to other places (except for those previously scheduled). At the same time, a special export agency was organized, adopting a quota system and a licensing system to control foreign trade, such as restricting rubber exports. Although Vietnam tries its best to satisfy Japan with the items transported to Japan, it intends to imitate Japan's organization and establish an import agency to control the items Japan transports to Vietnam. However, Japan expressed great dissatisfaction, and Japanese newspapers criticized it extensively, believing that Vietnam intended to undermine the economic agreement established on January 20.</p>
<p>Vietnam Has Gained Nothing</p>
<p>The purpose of Japan's move is to pressure Vietnam to allow Japanese goods to enter. It is not that Vietnam does not need Japanese goods. When Vietnam and Japan negotiated in Tokyo, Vietnam notified Japan that it hoped that Japan could supply it with the items it needed, such as hardware, chemicals, medicines, and dyes. At that time, Japan promised. Today, Vietnam has accepted its demands, but Japan has not fulfilled its promises and has supplied Vietnam with textiles and toys that Vietnam does not need.</p>

<p>When both parties were conducting these negotiations in Hanoi and Tokyo, the Japanese side could not wait to pressure the French side to fulfill its unilateral obligations in accordance with the agreement established in January. At present, Saigon rice has been transported to Japan in large quantities, and rubber will soon be transported there as well. After witnessing the suffering of Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies felt sympathetic and could not remain indifferent. Under the oil agreement established last year, the Dutch East Indies has been particularly generous to Japan, supplying it with one-third of its oil production.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Not Afraid of Any Threats</p>
<p>According to last year's agreement, part of the oil production is exchanged for goods. Japan is greedy and insatiable, and recently hoped that the Dutch East Indies would supply it with more oil. The Dutch East Indies replied, "Please pay in cash." The main issue in the negotiations held in the capital of the Dutch East Indies is this. The Japanese economic delegation sent to the Dutch East Indies for the second time was not as well-prepared as the first time. Japan's purpose seems to be to use threats and intimidation to force the Dutch East Indies to follow in Vietnam's footsteps and establish the same unilateral commercial agreement. The Dutch East Indies is not unwilling to accept reasonable demands, but it is not without options and has no defeatist sentiments. Therefore, it will be difficult to achieve results by trying to threaten the Dutch East Indies in the same way as it threatened Vietnam.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Electricity Supply in French Concession Temporarily Not Restricted, Because Generators Use Fuel Oil Instead of Coal; Situation Can Obtain Safe Supply if There Are No Changes <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Times reported that the Public Concession may reduce electricity supply to industries such as textiles and machinery due to the failure to obtain sufficient coal storage. However, on the French Concession side, there has been a temporary guarantee that there is no such emergency, at least not before now.</p>
<p>French Company Uses Fuel Oil</p>
<p>The manager of Shanghai French Electricity Company, Fafle, said yesterday morning (1st) that the company's power generation equipment all uses fuel oil instead of coal, and a safe supply can be obtained in the near future. However, he also warned about the delicate situation, which could cause changes at any moment.</p>
<p>If Supply Fails, Other Plans Will Be Made</p>
<p>According to preliminary estimates, the textile and machinery industries will be most severely affected by the reduction in electricity supply in the Public Concession, and Chinese factories that are currently operating at maximum capacity may be the first to be affected. The resulting unemployment is of course a topic that the committee should consider. However, factories and the public in the French Concession still have the freedom to use electricity because Fafle has made a clear guarantee. If there is an unforeseeable event in the situation, then other plans will have to be made.</p>
<p>Oil Supply Comes from Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Because the supply of fuel oil in this city all depends on the Dutch East Indies, the reason for Fafle's reserved restriction is obviously the volatile situation in the South Pacific. As for the power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, most of it relies on coal. Some equipment has recently been reformed to use fuel oil, but it accounts for less than 20% of all equipment. However, once something happens in the South Seas, the supply of fuel oil will face the same difficulties as coal, because the belligerent countries will definitely concentrate on sinking oil tankers.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Western Chamber of Commerce has decided to ask United States Lines to extend the Hong Kong route to Shanghai in order to promote commerce and benefit foreign residents. It is reported that United States Lines has considered it, because Shanghai merchants have been affected by the war, and shipping schedules are uncertain, causing airmail sent from Shanghai to not be able to catch ships to transport it to Hong Kong to be attached to the Clipper ship to the United States. Therefore, they requested the opening of the Hong Kong-Shanghai air route. The company is also planning to extend the Hong Kong-Philippines route to Singapore and believes that this plan is even more important than the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Therefore, it decided to open the Singapore route first, and then open the Hong Kong-Shanghai route.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Sufficient Food Reserves for Shanghai Residents; Urgent Need to Suppress Hoarding; Over 500,000 Quintals of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai in January; Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Rescheduled to Meet Today <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Sources of Foreign Rice Never Interrupted Regarding the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai in January, the Jianghai Customs has just completed the statistics, and a summary is provided below. The total amount is 501,733 quintals, worth 3,528,318 gold units, equivalent to a national currency value of 9,551,186.076. The third largest is Siam, with 66,862 quintals, and other places account for 2,513 quintals. This foreign rice can supply the city's food needs for more than a month, so the abundance of the city's food reserves can be imagined. However, because these reserves are monopolized and hoarded by speculative rice merchants and non-industry speculators, market trading has reached a situation where there are markets but no goods. The only important thing now is to suppress hoarding and encourage the procurement of food. Anyone who tries to hoard in the market should be severely punished in accordance with the law, otherwise the rice reserves will be manipulated.</p>
<p>Rice Evaluation Committee Rescheduled to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, in view of the frequent rise in rice prices, which is related to social order and the livelihood of civilians, and in order to comply with the intentions of the authorities, was originally scheduled to convene an evaluation committee meeting yesterday to discuss ways to lower the price limit of 15 types of foreign rice from a long-term perspective. However, yesterday was a Sunday, and the authorities were closed for the usual holiday, so they could not send representatives to attend. Now, for the sake of prudence, it has been rescheduled to convene the evaluation committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. today at the association hall on the third floor of No. 15, Edward Road. It is reported that the meeting will discuss (1) How to deal with the intentional increase in rice prices by foreign rice trading companies, which has increased the costs of the same industry; (2) Whether the price limit for foreign rice should be lowered again.</p>
<p>20,000 Bags of Tribute Rice Arrive Today</p>
<p>According to a revelation from the rice industry yesterday, the Pluto ship of Baolong Foreign Company, a Portuguese company, is expected to arrive in port from Saigon this afternoon. The ship is loaded with 20,000 bags of tribute rice and will be docked at pontoons 23 and 24 in the Huangpu River. As soon as unloading is completed, it will continue to export and load foreign rice to Shanghai. According to a rice industry committee member, there will be no interruption in the source of foreign rice. Last week, the number of foreign rice shipments to Shanghai was not as abundant as in previous weeks due to a slight reduction in foreign flights. Now, everything has been arranged gradually, and the number of ships carrying rice will increase. Therefore, it is expected that the source of foreign rice will be abundant.

<p>Today is Friends Day</p>
<h3 id="e45">Originator Huang Jingwan Encourages Friendship and Composes a Folk Song with Profound Meaning <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Today marks the seventh anniversary of the March 3rd Friends Day. The originator, Huang Jingwan, issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the most important thing in life is friendship. However, there are good and bad friends. Good friends encourage each other to overcome bad habits and make gradual progress, learn to be good people, and reverse the declining trends. Having lived in the world for thirty years, and witnessing the decline of friendship and the treacherousness of people's hearts, I initiated Friends Day seven years ago to emphasize the promotion of friendship. This year, on this day, we still face severe national crisis and a fierce European war. Countless friends are suffering. Due to the special circumstances, we cannot hold commemorative ceremonies or private banquets to celebrate. Therefore, I am issuing a declaration on this day to encourage friends at home and abroad to self-reflect. Every year on this day, I strive in various ways to inspire interest in friendship, awaken the psychology of friends loving groups and the world, and awaken the world's attention to the welfare of friends as the purpose. In other words, the purpose of Friends Day is to enhance the friendship between men and women, cultivate noble and pure personalities, foster a spirit of universal love and mutual assistance, realize the important mission of life, and then strive for one's position, improve virtue, study diligently, and become great assets to society and the nation. At the same time, it also calls on public opinion to pay attention to friendship, love people, and at all times and in all places, do its best to support social welfare undertakings (such as poverty relief, disaster relief, caring for children, and respecting the elderly, etc.). In short, it is hoped that all ethnic groups will not infringe on each other, but cooperate and assist each other, coexist and prosper together, and be able to deeply understand and practice, and seek the revitalization of humanity.</p>
<p>Folk Song</p>
<p>Mr. Huang recently composed a folk song for Friends Day amidst his busy schedule, which is recorded as follows: "Winter goes and spring comes quickly, young men and women, don't waste your youth. Making good friends brings smiles, encountering bad friends brings frowns. It's not just about academic inferiority, but a lack of character and trustworthiness. Usually, treating people may be too casual, but don't throw away morality. Cultivate your mind and nature peacefully, believe in optimism and write poetry. If you encounter difficulties, help each other. A noble personality is known far and wide. Working diligently brings happiness, old and young, men and women, take what you need. Faithfulness, righteousness, courtesy, and harmony are the virtues of friendship. Sharing joy is like the full moon, a helpful friend is better than gold. May you cherish the good spring, I offer this folk song to you. Don't forget the March 3rd Friends Day."</p>

<p>Shuyou, the five-year-old son of He Yurong, a native of Yangzhou residing in a bungalow in Caoxiebang, Gordon Road, was playing near his doorstep at 7:30 AM on the 24th, when he was lured away by Wang Xiaosanzi, a native of Jiangbei. Wang Xiaosanzi enticed the boy by saying he was taking him to play somewhere and offering him a beautiful pencil. The child, unaware of Wang's ill intentions, followed him to the entrance of Caoxiebang. There, Dai Xiaomei, the wife of the child's neighbor Shen A'er, spotted them. Dai remembered that her sister, Hongwen (age 7), had been lured away by Wang Xiaosanzi last winter but was later found and brought back. She immediately cried for help and apprehended Wang, taking him to the Putuo Road Police Station and handing him over to the Special Court for investigation. Recently, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, requested a severe punishment. The defendant confessed that he had previously worked at a certain yarn factory but had recently lost money gambling. He resorted to this desperate measure and begged for leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Wang Xiaosanzi to one year and six months in prison as a warning, and the pencil was confiscated.</p>

<p>Some businesses act as agents for pawning goods and even accept pawn tickets as collateral for cash. Their exorbitant interest rates exploit the poor to an extreme degree. The largest number of such shops is in West Shanghai, where they have been springing up like mushrooms after rain.

They are already relocating to the Xujiahui and Zhaojiabang areas, where there are over fifty such establishments. When will the harm they inflict on society finally be eradicated?</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:50 AM, three robbers suddenly broke into a house on 544 Baker Road, Public Concession. The robbers brandished imitation pistols and threatened the occupants, stealing two watches and a coat. The victims shouted "Robbers!"

<p>Yesterday, the focus was on the A League football match between Tung Wah and North-West YMCA, which ended in a 1-1 draw. In the first half, North-West YMCA led 1-0. In the second half, Tung Wah returned a goal, resulting in a draw. Tung Wah's hopes for the A League championship are not extinguished yet. In the future, everything will depend on the final battle against West Police. If West Police cannot defeat Tung Wah again, Tung Wah will have a hard time winning the championship. If Tung Wah wins the next two matches, it can still win the title. Yesterday, there were about 7,000 fans at the Canidrome. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Qin Bigao, He Jiatong, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Huang Kehou, Han Longhai, Wan Jin, Dai Linjing, Li Yichen, Fei Chunhua, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>North-West YMCA</p>
<p>Snichung, Paul, Rugen, Cairo, Lialio, Glevife, Dingel, Te, Nick, Kocklan, Katepei, Tauberlinki</p>
<p>An Unfavorable Start Results in Conceding a Goal</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tung Wah changed Li Yichen to lead the central attack, with Aja playing on the left wing. As a result, the performance was not good. In the second half, Huang Kehou was substituted, and Li Yichen retreated to center back. The situation improved significantly, demonstrating the significant impact of a single adjustment. North-West YMCA had a strong attack yesterday, but unfortunately, they failed to score multiple times. North-West YMCA kicked off first. As soon as the battle began, the ball went to Tung Wah's feet. Aja darted forward several times, passing the ball horizontally to Wan Jin, who swept it along the ground. Snichung caught it directly. Dingel cut in, lacking support. Aja made a high pass, and Li Yi laid it off. Dai Lin made a sharp angled shot. Dingel made a forceful kick along the touchline, which was swift and fierce. Qin Bigao saved the dangerous situation.</p>
<p>The situation became a stalemate. After 35 minutes, Dingel charged up like a raging horse, making a quick pass to the center. Kocklan took advantage of the opportunity to make a sliding shot, hitting the upper right corner, making it 1-0. North-West YMCA took the lead. The first half ended like this.</p>
<p>Changing the Formation to Achieve a Draw</p>
<p>After the lemon break, Tung Wah deployed troops and arranged a new formation. Zhuang Youren was moved to the left side, Han Longhai to the right back, He Jiatong to left winger, Liang Shutang to the right side. Little Fei and Aja had already been rotated in the forward line. At this time, Li Yi was moved to center back, and Huang Kehou replaced him in the front line. The formation took on a brand new look.</p>
<p>On the North-West YMCA side, the two inside forwards also swapped positions. Tung Wah's luck was extremely poor, making it impossible to make a comeback. Aja, Dai, Little Fei, Little Wan, and Huang Kehou all took a series of shots, but either missed or went too high. Half an hour passed again. After a dangerous shot from Kocklan, Tung Wah launched a desperate counterattack. Li Yi intercepted the ball from the midfield, made a long pass to Aja, and Aja charged forward fiercely, passing Rugen and Paul, and crossed the ball to the center. The landing point was less than five yards from the goal. Little Wan Jin was waiting on the side, lightly touching the ball, and Snichung was caught off guard. The ball flew straight into the net, and the whole stadium erupted with firecrackers. Tung Wah was fortunate enough to avoid defeat with a 1-1 draw.</p>

<p>Youyou and Yousheng, two strong Chinese B League teams, played a B League match at the Aurora University field yesterday. For Youyou, Sun "Iron Leg" was absent to watch the game, and Chairman Cheng Yize made a personal appearance. On the Yousheng side, they had solid kicking skills and entered the field with a strong presence. After the match began, both sides had their own attacks and defenses, and they remained stalemated for 15 minutes. Zhang Mingsheng flicked the ball with his right foot and shot with his left foot, a skillful move that caught Yousheng goalkeeper Wei Zhenxing off guard, making it 1-0. After the center kick-off, within a minute, Yousheng's Ye Yiting attacked the goal. Tao Ziwu parried it away, but not far enough. Gan Zhiyi added a shot, which was both close and difficult, tying the score at 1-1. After that, both sides exchanged attacks, forming a back-and-forth battle. Neither side gained anything, and the first half ended in a 1-1 draw. In the second half, the situation became a stalemate again. Until the last ten minutes, Youyou, under dangerous circumstances, scored a goal by Cao Qinfang, making it 2-1. The victory was almost secured. Soon after, Chairman Cheng added the finishing touch, shooting a goal from close range, making it 3-1. Youyou won with a score of 3-1. Their chances of winning the championship are now even higher.

<p>The Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee held a reception for recruitment team leaders at noon yesterday. Over a hundred people attended, including Yuan Ludeng, Chen Qingshi, Hu Zuyin, Huang Yantang, and Lin Chongzhi. The meeting was chaired by Yuan Ludeng, the head of the recruitment team. During the meeting, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech, stating: "Today, the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee is holding a reception for team leaders. I, as the head of the recruitment team, would like to say a few words on behalf of the entire Preparatory Committee. First, on behalf of the entire Preparatory Committee, I extend a warm welcome to all of you. Despite your busy schedules, you have still found time to raise funds for the Children's Library. Your enthusiasm is truly admirable. You are the benefactors of the children of Shanghai. I should also express my gratitude to you on behalf of the children of Shanghai. Second, preparing the funding for the Children's Library is not an easy task. Although the amount of 50,000 yuan is not very large, it is indeed difficult to raise this amount given the current high cost of living. Therefore, I want to encourage everyone not to underestimate this task. At the same time, do not be discouraged if you encounter obstacles during the process. Finally, we have a saying in China, 'Where there's a will, there's a way.' I firmly believe that as long as everyone works hard, we will surely achieve satisfactory results. I wish you all a smooth recruitment process and look forward to the early completion of the Children's Library." Chen Qingshi, the chief strategist, then spoke, elaborating on the importance of establishing a Children's Library and reporting that the Public Works Department is also preparing to establish a small-scale Children's Library within the Northern District Elementary School on Connaught Road to enhance children's welfare. This can be complementary. Hu Zuyin, representing the Standing Committee, reported on the progress of the preparation. Ding Bingnan, the deputy secretary, reported on the fundraising situation. Huang Jingwan, Zhang Zupei, Li Shanzhan, Liang Zhongyuan, Su Luxiang, and others spoke successively, contributing their opinions. After the chairman summarized the results: (1) It was agreed to request all major primary and secondary schools in the city to universally organize recruitment teams to assist in fundraising. (2) It was agreed to request all newspapers to promote the cause of children's welfare as much as possible. (3) Fundraising efforts should be intensified to complete the fundraising target before this year's Children's Day. (4) The revised reward measures for enthusiastic donors are as follows: (1) Those who donate one dime or more will receive a commemorative badge. (2) Those who donate one yuan or more will receive a specially made commemorative badge. (3) Those who donate five yuan or more will receive a bronze commemorative badge. (4) Those who donate fifty yuan or more will receive a silver commemorative badge. (5) Those who donate one hundred yuan or more will receive a banner. (6) Those who donate five hundred yuan or more will receive a plaque. (7) Those who donate one thousand yuan or more will receive a plaque and have their photograph displayed for permanent commemoration.</p>
<p>Suggesting Fundraising on March 8th</p>
<p>Madam Qin Shuluan, the wife of Mr. Ying Yongwang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, suggested that since the March 8th Women's Day coincides with the period of fundraising for the Children's Library, and considering the close relationship between women and children, she sent a letter to the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) yesterday, initiating a fundraising campaign for the Children's Library Committee on March 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Natural Gasoline in the Soviet Union by Xu Boxiao <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>This article was originally written by U. Boksierman, the Director and Engineer of the Gas Directorate under the People's Committee of Petroleum of the Soviet Union, and published in the Izvestia newspaper in Moscow on January 3rd.  ——Transliteration</p>
<p>Natural gasoline, measured by its highest calorific value (8,000 calories per cubic Russian yard, a unit of heat) and chemical composition, is not only an excellent fuel for industrial enterprises and cities, but also a valuable product, a high-grade volatile oil, and a raw material for the production of soot and other similar products derived from gasoline. Therefore, the capitalist countries consider natural gasoline as an industry that should be widely developed during the Second World War, especially the United States.</p>
<p>In the United States, the extraction of natural gasoline in 1939 was 62.26 billion cubic Russian yards. In 1938, the industrial enterprises accounted for 79% of the total extraction of natural gasoline, and the needs of life accounted for 16%. At the end of 1938, the number of gasoline wells reached 53,000.</p>
<p>The United States has the longest gasoline transportation network, with a total distance (main line distribution) of 300,000 kilometers in 1938. Among them, the annual production of gasoline was 1.8 trillion cubic Russian yards. Specifically, in 1939, the high-quality volatile oil produced from natural gasoline accounted for 5.5 million tons, and the number of gas plants reached 620 in 1940.</p>
<p>The United States has greatly expanded its business of burning petroleum into liquid gas. Its sales volume in 1939 was about 90 million liters, an increase of 36% compared to 1938. From 1929 to 1939 (a total of ten years), the demand for liquid gas in the United States increased as high as 90 times. Liquid gas has a high calorific value of 100 and is suitable to replace volatile oil for automatic transportation or propulsion and life needs. The investment in the gasoline industry in the United States is 49.8 billion US dollars, of which the natural gasoline industry accounts for 26.7 billion US dollars. This is a larger investment than other industries: such as the automobile industry, which is 13 billion US dollars, and the steel casting industry, which is 400 million US dollars. The production of soot reached more than 238,000 tons in 1939.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's estimated reserves of natural gasoline are roughly equivalent to those of the United States. However, due to insufficient exploration and equipment in its production areas, the 18th plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union listed it as a major agenda item, deciding to expand the acquisition of gasoline benefits from petroleum, clean up gasoline production areas, and underground coal gasification, which should be increased by three and a half times in the third five-year plan.</p>
<p>The output of natural gasoline must be increased by two times in 1942. The basic work in the past two years is to pay attention to the needs of different petroleum regions in the Soviet Union, estimate the development of production, and transform petroleum into gasoline.</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union soon promulgated a decree on the development of petroleum gasoline utilization and volatile oil production. This decision is the procedure for the petroleum industry workers to follow.</p>
<p>The natural gasoline industry is one of the seedlings in the Soviet Union's national economy. It has been composed or is currently being composed in the Stalin year of the five-year plan (i.e., this year). The extraction of gasoline in the Azerbaidzanskaja petroleum industry has increased more than ten times compared to 1913.</p>
<p>In 1940, the improvement of the gasoline economic work of the People's Committee of the Soviet Union Petroleum Industry has been achieved. Since July, the gasoline extraction plan has been practically exceeded and its application has been improved. Although there was little improvement in the extraction and application of gasoline before this, the only problem lies in sorting out the loss of gasoline and volatile oil.</p>
<p>The consumption of gasoline in the petroleum business is still very large. The basic reason is the lack of a secret system for the construction of gasoline production areas (the organization of refining from petroleum well openings to oil storage ponds) and the stagnation of the work of acquiring gasoline in new oil wells and new petroleum area gasoline areas.</p>
<p>There are still soil blocks, gasoline consumption, and evaporation fractionation issues in the petroleum business. The first thing to do is to eliminate these soil blocks, so it is necessary to first improve the construction of oil ponds and gasoline pumps for spraying oil, as well as pressers, and replace the petroleum pressing extraction method with the air-pressure oil suction method.</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union decided to stipulate the procedures for business and secret construction work from 1941 to 1942. This work must be fully achieved in the basic oil areas of the Soviet Union, such as Baku, Mayangba, Ishimbaya, and Pukoroslana, in the past two years. The largest work of gasoline storage ponds and transportation must be laid in Kazakhastan, Turkemen, and Birikam.</p>
<p>The secret construction work is first the Azov Petroleum Company's General Toras, and the first phase is given significant work. The "Stalin," "Kaganovich," and "Azizbek" petroleum companies have built stone and iron petroleum storage rooms, refineries, and pipe cylinders. There are hundreds of well exchange open warehouses, and seven air-converted gasoline pressing stations. The development of its volatile oil, compared to 1938, has increased by 6 to 7 per thousand for Surakha Petroleum, 7 to 10 per thousand for Karachukhor Petroleum, and more than 1 percent for Bodin Petroleum.</p>
<p>The Azirbayen Company, together with the Party organs, resolutely extracts petroleum, and uses air pressure to extract gasoline at a rate of more than 100 tons per day and night. Other petroleum extraction Toras extracts 20 to 30 tons. Therefore, the "Kirov," "Kaganovich," "Gergez," and other petroleum companies have tried to absorb the spraying oil, condense the black bursting rock, form wells from open warehouses, lay gasoline pumps, and so on.</p>
<p>As a result, the progress is very rapid. The company has not only completed but also exceeded the national plan in a concrete way. The daily gasoline production has increased by 20%, especially the Toras of the Oljonikitzi Petroleum Company has achieved the best results in gasoline extraction. It can be guaranteed to systematically extract gasoline from new wells, and at the same time, pumps and black bursting rocks should be equipped.</p>
<p>The government has now promulgated a ban on the construction of new oil wells and oil ponds extracting gasoline without the implementation of work on January 1, 1941. This ban applies to secret construction work, as well as the general development of business economy.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction work of the two gas plants, the only problem lies in guaranteeing the extraction of volatile oil extracted from petroleum in the short term. Therefore, new factories should be built to transport the gasoline of existing gas plants in a short period of time. The work of the Baku and Gruz factories is not fully capable, although they have the possibility of transportation.</p>
<p>In the past two years, great work must be carried out to utilize liquid gas, showing the fractured haystacks of natural gasoline fractionation in liquid gas. The huge development of gasoline volatile oil production encourages the expansion of liquid gas resources.</p>
<p>Liquid gas is used as a substitute fuel for automobile transportation, and the Soviet Union has entered the experimental period. Designed by government agencies, attempts are made to lead the way and widely introduce the excellent parts. Automobile supply stations must establish gas plants (existing or under construction) under the jurisdiction of aircraft and automobile storage warehouses. The construction of the first station in Baku has been completed.</p>
<p>The relevant People's Committees (such as the three committees of Medium Machines, Black Metals, and Petroleum) expressed that they cannot delay on this issue, and the Liu Beretzki Factory's liquid gas plant will transport the volatile oil to the Moscow bus yard (about two to three months) in a short period of time. The Moscow Municipal Government issued this order as early as 1939, but it has not been done yet.</p>
<p>In the third five-year plan, efforts are made to produce and utilize natural gasoline in the deep gasoline production areas. The equipment in the production area is still insufficient and needs to be greatly organized and explored.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the utilization of gasoline must be developed, with the western region of Ukraine in the Guangmi Autonomous Region of Izrum being the most important.</p>
<p>The Dashava, Obaoli, and Kaloshi production areas that have now been built can guarantee the gasoline supply for industries and cities in western Ukraine. To reserve and increase the needs of the region, the gasoline pumping ditch will communicate with the Kief area. Kief has been making gasoline supply drafts for five years, but it is not sufficient, so it imports Donetsk fuel.</p>
<p>The Izrum gasoline production area has 11 oil wells. The gasoline from Izrum can be transferred to the industrial centers of North Ural, Berezhniki, Sulegemsk, Molotov, and other places by a distribution pipe. The implementation of this transfer gasoline over a long distance should be reorganized.</p>
<p>In addition, it is necessary to organize the gasoline exploration of Dagestan, where chemical glass, iodine, and other factories have been established, but the vast Dagestan production area has not been fully utilized.</p>
<p>The Zaporozhye state refines gasoline, which can greatly develop the along-Azov proletariat area near Melitopol. The oil springs are only 70 to 80 yards deep, and it takes only 10 to 15 days to open a well. Voloshilovsk in the Olteyo Kitzi border area can also be developed.</p>
<p>From 1941 to 1942, petroleum industry workers will vigorously promote the natural gasoline industry, which is the most powerful preparation for the Soviet Union's national economy.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance reiterated the ban on privately purchasing gold. A certain person frankly said: "It doesn't matter—I'm doing futures."</p>
<p>Everyone is worried about the price of rice in Shanghai after the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, and hoarders are preparing to make a fortune. Unfortunately, when that time comes, the hoarded grain in the warehouse will become the Japanese army's military grain, and it will all be confiscated and "publicly" charged. The only way for hoarders to prepare for a rainy day is to quickly get out of the cage, but unfortunately, no one wants to be a scapegoat. As a result, the rice price plummeted, completely unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The fixed deposit for group purchases of rice is 40 yuan per bag. Transactions in the rice market have never paid a deposit. At the end of last year, there was a method of paying a fixed deposit of 5 yuan per bag. But it always gives people a different feeling of "restriction" and "reward." Speaking of which, they are all good deeds to "stabilize the people's food."</p>
<p>The rice brokers temporarily suspended entering the market the day before yesterday, saying that "at this time of chaos in the rice market, they will temporarily suspend entering the market as intermediaries to avoid external criticism." Some people said, "This is coy," but no one would pay attention to their pretty faces. Some people said, "This is a strike." That's right: there was a notice on the surface that "rice stored in the warehouse should be cleared within a time limit" that day.</p>
<p>As soon as the news of the reduction in power supply came out, the price of yarn became popular. But no one thought that if coal could not continue to come and the power had to be reduced, the cloth would also have no customers.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Secret of Rising Prices <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Leichun</p>
<p>Since the recent tensions in the Far East, the question of war or peace between the US and Japan has drawn widespread attention, particularly among speculators who manipulate the market. They view the Sino-Japanese conflict and any related international issues in the Far East as opportunities to create artificial market fluctuations. Especially in Shanghai, wealthy merchants with vast amounts of floating capital operate in three stages: first, fabricating rumors; second, hoarding goods; and third, raising prices. These three actions are inherently intertwined. However, for the sake of resistance and national reconstruction, the future of the Chinese nation, and the overall improvement of people's livelihoods, how should we curb rising prices? This is arguably the most critical issue on the economic front.</p>
<p>The rise in Shanghai prices differs from that in the interior. Since the outbreak of the European and Asian wars, Shanghai's transportation lines have not faced the same absolute difficulties as those in Free China. Therefore, Shanghai's soaring prices are not due to transportation difficulties or supply-demand imbalances. In contrast, the types and multiples of price increases in the interior last autumn were: first, metal materials up twelvefold; second, fuel up ninefold; third, clothing up sevenfold; fourth, miscellaneous goods up slightly over fourfold; fifth, construction materials up fourfold; and sixth, food up threefold. This reflects the general situation in the interior, where transportation is relatively convenient. However, in Shanghai, while prices are generally rising, the types of increases differ significantly, almost in inverse proportion. Food and daily necessities have seen the most substantial increases. As stated in the Shanghai News editorial, "Since the war, the highest price increases have been for rice, coal, and flour, nearing tenfold." Therefore, attributing Shanghai's price increases to supply-demand imbalances is a complete misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is part of Chinese society, its economic structure differs from the semi-feudal, semi-colonial nature of Free China. It is a component of the comprador class; semi-feudalism does not truly exist there. However, since the National Army's westward retreat and Shanghai's transformation into an isolated island, its economy has grown and developed in a distorted manner. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were originally prosperous regions. After their homelands were occupied, wealthy individuals with large amounts of liquid capital mostly retreated with banks from the occupied areas. Although they were considered "high-class refugees," finding a place as "retired gentlemen" in Shanghai, where integration into the comprador class was difficult, their options for managing these vast funds were limited to investment and speculation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe the problem of rising prices in Shanghai is not truly about supply-demand imbalances. We should not believe the nonsense of speculators, especially rice weevils. Supply-demand imbalances have their own price equilibrium laws. The current price increases in Shanghai deviate significantly from these laws, so we assert that it is not a matter of supply-demand imbalances.</p>
<p>Some self-proclaimed economists believe that war inevitably leads to currency inflation. However, considering the price increases in Shanghai, it cannot be attributed to increased legal tender circulation. We all know that since Shanghai became an isolated island, the available floating capital that can be statistically accounted for has reached 200 billion yuan. However, according to the official figures released by the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) at the end of June last year, the total amount of legal tender issued was just over 390 billion yuan. If all the floating capital in Shanghai were legal tender, the four banks' legal tender issuance would certainly exceed this figure. This proves that Shanghai's floating capital is mostly in bank deposits and public bond futures, while large holdings of legal tender as wealth are rare. Therefore, Shanghai's floating capital consists more of intangible legal tender than tangible legal tender. It can be said that the high prices in Shanghai cannot be attributed to either supply-demand imbalances or currency inflation.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, ordinary people, deeply affected by the rising cost of living, have coined a new phrase: "Paper money is worthless." This phrase originates from currency inflation. Although currency inflation leads to a decline in currency value, which affects price increases, this is an irrefutable argument. However, in general currency inflation, the resulting price increases are gradual. The recent soaring prices in Shanghai are not gradual but jump-like, especially changing with the changing political climate. Although the legal tender issued by the four banks before the war was only slightly over 140 billion yuan, less than three times the 390 billion yuan, the price increases in Shanghai are not significantly related to the increased currency issuance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, stabilizing the value of legal tender is essential for wartime economic policy. However, curbing prices is a practical measure to prevent rampant currency inflation.</p>
<p>Some also say that the decline in foreign exchange rates is a reason for rising prices. Shanghai, in particular, is a major market for the foreign exchange black market. In countries with economically dependent economies, the exchange rate inevitably influences prices. We also acknowledge that China's economic strength is not yet fully independent. This is an undeniable fact. When the war began, the legal tender exchange rate against the British pound was one shilling and two and a half pence, the official exchange rate. Up to now, judging from the rate of decline in the exchange rate, it has fallen by only about three-quarters. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, linked to the British pound, is almost the same. In terms of exchange rates, the price of imported foreign goods should increase by about four times to balance the exchange rate ratio. However, the current price of imported foreign goods has risen by seven or eight to ten times compared to the beginning of the war. This indicates that the exchange rate fluctuation is not the main reason for soaring prices. Even more strangely, the current soaring prices are primarily for domestically produced and sold daily necessities, which are irrelevant to the fall of the foreign exchange black market.</p>
<p>Stabilizing foreign exchange black market prices is also necessary for wartime foreign economic policy. However, the reason for the decline in Shanghai's foreign exchange black market is not the recent surge in foreign goods imports. The main reason is that one party is using legal tender to acquire foreign exchange. Secondly, wealthy merchants and corrupt elements are fleeing overseas with their funds, causing Shanghai's black market foreign exchange to continuously decline. Currently, the foreign goods imported into Shanghai are not primarily military equipment or food, although they exist, but are secondary. The main imports are luxury goods consumed by wealthy and noble individuals. They have money, manipulate the market in Shanghai, profit from the national crisis, and live a life of extravagance. Ordinary people, although they do not need foreign goods or consume foreign exchange, bear the responsibility of using foreign currency for the domestic goods they use. That is, the prices of domestic goods rise simultaneously, outpacing the price increases of foreign goods. This is because the few who use foreign goods hoard domestic goods, causing trouble with 200 billion yuan of floating capital, not the depreciation of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>If the above three factors are not the main reasons for the secret of rising prices, then it is hoarding and speculation. We also believe this is the case. Although the above three points can contribute to rising prices, they are not the main reason. The main culprit is the hoarding and speculation caused by the accumulation of 200 billion yuan of floating capital.</p>
<p>Hoarding goods and monopolizing for profit are not investment but speculative behavior. Since the war, they have witnessed the destruction and damage caused to national industries near Shanghai by the war and the enemy, the control of occupied areas, the blockade of Free China, and the lack of materials and transportation difficulties in the interior. All these provide opportunities for speculators to exploit. Hoarding and speculation are inherently speculative activities. For the sake of stability, they primarily hoard daily necessities. The soaring prices of daily necessities now serve as proof.</p>
<p>Speculators, seeking to profit from the national crisis, have cast national welfare and people's livelihood to the winds. They see that the more they hoard, the higher prices rise, and the greater their profits become. However, they fail to realize that rising prices weaken consumers' purchasing power, leading to social panic due to livelihood anxieties. The war is prolonged, and ordinary people suffer more. Although the National Government is promoting production and thrift, it is being offset by the hoarding and speculation of speculators. The path to victory from the hardships of the people is prolonged. All this is thanks to the speculators who hoard and speculate.</p>
<p>It is difficult to reduce prices back to their original levels. However, if we can eliminate the speculators who hoard and speculate, at least Shanghai's prices can fall somewhat. Even if it is difficult to bring them down, we can prevent future price increases.</p>
<p>Sanctioning hoarding is an urgent matter. However, how to sanction it is the immediate concern. Some advocate: first, moral sanctions; second, political sanctions; third, warning sanctions. However, others say that moral sanctions are a waste of time for speculators. Political sanctions cannot be implemented when the National Government's orders reach Shanghai because Shanghai is already an isolated island. Warning sanctions can only lead to punishment when warnings are ineffective. However, I believe that the spirit of mobilization should be implemented in Shanghai, using moral, political, and warning methods simultaneously. Although it should not be overdone, it is better than doing nothing. At least some effect can be achieved in the future. The secret of rising prices is not a mystery. We only need to quickly implement sanctions against hoarders and speculators from multiple perspectives.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Piece Goods: Among Woolens, Only Plush Falls <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of woolen goods, whether yarn, silk, woolen fabrics from local factories or foreign goods, have been firm, and most are still rising. Only plush goods (except camel hair) such as mohair, sea tiger plush, long and short hair sea dragon plush, bear hair plush, and spiral plush have been falling in price. Sellers are willing to cut prices to sell, but in fact, even if they are cheap, no one is buying. Those who need them only need the fast-selling products of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Because plush is only suitable for winter coats, it is now off-season. To wait for the market, one must wait another seven or eight months. Moreover, prices have reached their peak. If new goods can arrive, the cost can still be calculated. Moreover, the colors are incomplete, and there is a large inventory, which makes importers even more disinterested. Currently, ordinary mohair is sold at a reduced price of 75 yuan, long-haired sea dragon plush at 61 yuan, short-haired at 56-57 yuan, bear hair plush with the Water Overflowing Jinshan brand at 63 yuan, and spiral plush at 12 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Coffee (Continued) <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The custom of drinking coffee was introduced to Egypt in the early 16th century and to Europe in the mid-17th century. After the Turkish ambassador used it to entertain guests, it became even more popular. However, at that time, the coffee trade was entirely controlled by the Egyptians. They transported coffee from the city of Moka to various European countries, and like various monopoly organizations, the value was of course arbitrarily determined. This inevitably made Europeans feel exploited and annoyed. They were unwilling to rely on the Egyptians and pay them such a transit tax. In 1710, merchants from Saint-Male in the Brittany region of France formed a company to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and directly purchase coffee in Moka. At the same time, Europeans saw that the need for coffee was increasing day by day and the profits were high, so they also tried to cultivate it in various colonies. The first to realize this plan was the Dutchman Nicolas Witsen. In 1690, he brought the first coffee tree to Java, and by 1743, he was able to transport 3.5 million catties of coffee beans to the Dutch mother country! The coffee trees on Ceylon and India were all passed down from Java. France first had coffee trees in 1714, the year the Spanish War of Succession ended. The mayor of Amsterdam in the Netherlands obtained some coffee trees from Java and gifted one to the famous French King Louis XIV, who planted it in the famous Paris Botanical Garden. In 1723 AD, a French officer named De Clieu obtained a special permit from King Louis XV to carry three coffee trees propagated from the botanical garden across the sea to Martinique Island in the West Indies to take up his post. On the way, water was in short supply, and two coffee trees had already withered. De Clieu could not bear to let the beloved third tree dry up, so he shared his last sip of water with the small tree, saving its life. This was the beginning of coffee trees in the West Indies. Later, almost all the coffee trees on the islands were direct descendants of this one tree. As for Brazil, which now holds the reins of coffee beans, producing 80-90% of the world's output, its formal cultivation of coffee trees started later, beginning in 1815, although a priest had already transplanted coffee trees there in 1773.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the brief history of coffee shops, which occupy such an important position in modern cities socially and are as numerous as teahouses and taverns. The establishment of coffee shops actually began in the early 15th century, first discovered in the holy city of Mecca in Islam. Later, throughout the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and Syria, they were established everywhere like bamboo shoots after rain. The first coffee shop in Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire, was in 1553, opened by two Syrians. Since the establishment of this coffee shop, countless Muslims have flocked to it in droves, and the business has flourished day by day. The Islamic religious leader, witnessing this situation, feared that Islamic churches would be deserted in the future and would become a wilderness, so he ordered the coffee shop to be closed. The customers who drank coffee were fined on the date of the public judgment, wearing animal skins as black as coffee grounds, and the two owners of the coffee shop were each beaten eighty times. However, drinking coffee has already become a trend and cannot be suppressed by violence. Later, the ban was lifted, and coffee shops were opened everywhere again, but they had to pay some taxes to the state. Coffee shops in France were first established in Marseille in 1654. Later, in 1672, the Procope coffee shop and the Pascal coffee shop in Paris, which have long been famous in history and are frequented by countless famous writers, philosophers, or politicians as gathering places, were also established one after another. Moreover, the Procope coffee shop was the first to invent and manufacture "frozen ripples" for supply, which was immediately welcomed by customers and became popular everywhere. Coffee shops in London were established in 1662, but their number increased so quickly that in 1665 King Charles II was already somewhat frightened and had to close them: saying that this was a den of filth, a nest of treacherous people full of conspiracies! As for the coffee shops in other major European cities, they also sprang up almost simultaneously everywhere. Later, some people came up with new tricks, attaching performances, dances, and music to the coffee shop to attract customers, and its business was of course becoming more and more prosperous, following the current situation.</p>

<h3 id="e73">The New Life Movement in the Family <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang has quickly been going on for seven full years. In these seven full years, how many people have gotten rid of old bad habits and embarked on a new path? And how many people abide by propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and practice the standards of orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, and frugality, promptness, and reliability? Thinking from the individual to the situation of a family, most are scattered, disorganized, and without order. Things are piled up randomly and do not look good. The housewife entrusts everything to ignorant servants, but she herself enjoys painting bamboo at night in the amusement park (i.e., playing mahjong), watching movies, listening to operas, and dancing at will. The next day, the sun is already high, but she still hasn't gotten up, her hair is disheveled, and her spirit is low. What orderliness and cleanliness are there? What simplicity, frugality, promptness, and reliability are there? This phenomenon is especially true for families on the isolated island, which is known as the paradise of adventurers. Secondly, the prevalence of smoking and gambling in homes in the occupied areas is also an undeniable fact. Chairman Chiang said, "This is everyone's internal enemy who is self-destructing!" These are truly incisive words. The author believes that whether housewives can practice the "New Life Movement in the Family" is the starting point for the revival of the nation. Ancient sages said, "Cultivate oneself and then regulate the family; regulate the family and then govern the state; govern the state and then pacify the world." The family precepts of the sage Zhu Bolu also say, "Get up at dawn, sweep and clean the courtyard, keep the inside and outside clean, rest when it is dark, and personally check the doors..." All these are "maxims" for housewives to manage their families. To have a "prosperous and never-declining family," one must practice the standards of orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and reliability to be effective.</p>
<p>Everyone should deeply remember and strive to believe in and follow the broadcast speech given by Chairman Chiang at the 7th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting. He said, "...Why do we promote propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame? Everyone must know that the opposite of 'propriety' is not valuing order, not abiding by discipline, and not being familiar with the rules; the opposite of 'righteousness' is not speaking of integrity, not fulfilling one's duties, and not being responsible; the opposite of 'integrity' is not understanding right and wrong, not distinguishing between public and private, and not valuing moral character; the opposite of 'shame' is having no integrity, no sense of shame, and no awareness; therefore, we must correct these shortcomings to be considered practicing the 'Four Cardinal Principles'....Everyone must know that the opposite of 'orderliness' is chaos and disorganization; the opposite of 'cleanliness' is filth and corruption; the opposite of 'simplicity' is complexity and tediousness; the opposite of 'frugality' is luxury and extravagance; the opposite of 'promptness' is slowness and numbness; the opposite of 'reliability' is hypocrisy and deception. If these six major ills can be completely eradicated, China's nation-building work will advance rapidly...." I say that in the family, being able to achieve what Chairman Chiang has indicated to eradicate those six major ills, this great family is a strong cell in China's nation-building work. Housewives! Arise! Cleanse yourselves! In the big and small aspects of "food, clothing, housing, and transportation" in the family, quickly achieve the six major living standards of orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and reliability, strictly abide by the discipline of life, and then you will be worthy of the new families of the future new China.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Do Chinese Women Really Need Hats? <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Si's great work "Why Chinese Women Don't Have Hats" in the current issue of this publication on July 24, I truly admire Mr. Si's thorough research on Chinese women's hats. However, is it really necessary for Chinese women to have hats? That needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Chinese women are not absolutely without hats, and the elimination of phoenix coronets and headscarves can be taken as proof that they have no hats or do not use hats. However, it is absolutely not possible to think that this is the reason for the lack of hats. You must know that "lack" and "absence" are completely different!</p>
<p>As for the popularity of hairnets and ribbons, saying that "Chinese women need hats" is also somewhat far-fetched. Let's not talk about the fact that women will not get nervous diseases because they don't wear hats. In fact, the popularity of hairnets and ribbons is only to avoid disheveled hair. This can be confirmed by the current trend of young girls wearing braids and the prevalence of hair combing among middle-aged and older women. Speaking of "accidentally discovering that rural women wear bowl-shaped hats" also means that this is formed due to the special living environment of the women. At the same time, it can be seen that in the living circle of most Chinese women, there is no such superfluous so-called "need"!</p>
<p>Practically speaking, foreign women wear hats because of their own historical background and traditional customs. And the fact that the strange hats of the seven dwarfs can be popular in the United States can be used to understand the shortcomings of American women's psychology! Chinese women who wear cheongsams will never blindly sigh for hats in this way, unless she is a complete and authentic foreign slave!</p>
<p>Whether women's hats are needed is as described above. Moreover, today's China is practicing the movement of frugality, who would be foolish enough to be willing to bear the suspicion of running counter to it?</p>
<p>Finally, there are two points that the author thinks are worth mentioning: First, the only condition for clothing is practicality, not peculiarity. Second, although European clothing has its merits, blindly imitating it and acting as the tail of foreigners is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Economic Rice Cooking Method <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Jun</p>
<p>Now that the price of rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, everyone feels life is difficult. The isolated island is affected by the current situation, and business is inferior to last year. Therefore, the difficulty of making a living can be imagined. There is no way to increase income, so reducing expenditure is urgent. However, the ways to economize are numerous and broad, and cannot be fully described in a short article. Here, I will first describe in detail how to cook delicious white rice with an economical method for the three meals a day, so that you can choose from them:</p>
<p>Every day, save two or three bowls of leftover cold rice. When cooking rice, mix the cold rice into the washed rice and stir well. Then put it into the pot and cook it in the same way as usual. The cooked rice will definitely be more than the pure rice cooked without adding cold rice. This cold rice is commonly known as "cold rice mother," which means endless generation. According to my experience, the ratio of cold rice to uncooked rice should not exceed one-third, otherwise the taste will be inferior. For example, if a family of eight needs eight bowls of rice per meal, and about twenty-four bowls of rice are cooked, if one and a half bowls of cold rice are added, then twenty-seven bowls of rice will be cooked, enough for nine people to eat. The added one and a half bowls of rice can save half a bowl of uncooked rice. Over time, the money saved on rice each year is also considerable. Anyone who wants to try the above method, please cook one or two more bowls of rice first, and keep it as the cold rice mother for the next meal, ready to be mixed with uncooked rice for cooking.

<h3 id="e76">The Strange Stones of Huang Garden <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>Gardens occupy a very important place in one's residence, and can even be said to be a spiritual food. However, on this isolated island, there are very few gardens with equipment, as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>A garden must have a few exquisite Taihu stones to embellish it, so that the garden can be more beautiful and you can get a lot of elegance. Therefore, the garden and Taihu stones are inseparable. Speaking of Taihu stones, wrinkles, transparency, thinness, and leakage are the four necessary conditions. If one of them is missing, it cannot be considered a top-grade strange stone. On the isolated island after the war, it is not easy to see such a perfect Taihu stone. However, I recently discovered many strange stones in Huang Garden on Gaun Road, and the most peculiar one is the stone carved with "Little Weaver Girl Stone." It is about seven or eight feet high, weighs about two or three tons, and has all the four conditions of wrinkles, transparency, thinness, and leakage. It does not look like a natural Taihu stone, but seems to be carved by hand. According to the dictionary, the origin of the "Weaver Girl Stone" is: "Someone was looking for the source of the river and saw a woman washing silk. He asked her, and she said that this was the Milky Way. So he gave her a stone and went home. He asked Yan Junping, and Junping said that this was the Weaver Girl's Weaver Stone." This stone is called "Little Weaver Girl Stone," and its mystery can be known. The second most important stone is the "Cloud" stone, which is even larger than the "Little Weaver Girl Stone." The characters carved on the stone are very old. Later, according to Mr. Huang Yueyuan, the owner of the garden, "This batch of Taihu stones was removed from an old garden between Suzhou and Changshu, and transported to Shanghai, which took a lot of effort. Moreover, I haven't been out of the barbed wire fence for a year, but when I heard this news, I was very excited and resolutely stepped out of the barbed wire fence and brought back these souvenirs..." The old gentleman was very talkative and energetic. I walked around the garden and saw that the dragon cypress, red maple, weeping plum, etc. were planted in an orderly manner. There were also thousands of peonies, which would be very beautiful when they bloom in the future. I heard that there is a kind of yellow peony, which is very precious. So I made an appointment with the old gentleman to appreciate the peonies, and I will definitely go there to broaden my horizons in the future. He has hundreds of acres of planting fields in Zhenru, which is very large. I heard that the trees in Zhang Garden, which recently opened, are also completely produced in the Zhenru planting field, and were arranged by his son, Mr. Delin. Such courage is really admirable.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Water chestnuts are originally a very ordinary thing among fruits, but it is said that they have the effect of clearing heat and digesting food. It can be eaten as a fruit, or it can be used as an auxiliary product for meat and vegetarian dishes. Cantonese families often use it. Although we are not from Guangdong, we also like to use it to cook. For example, when stir-frying diced meat, diced chicken, or stir-fried shrimp, cut the water chestnuts into small pieces and stir-fry them together. When eating, you feel that it is crisp and sweet, and it is especially delicious. As for vegetarian dishes, such as braised vegetarian ten scenes, stir-fried bamboo shoots with dried mushrooms, you can also add water chestnuts, whether you cut them into dices or slices, they are very suitable.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Art of Scolding People <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaomu Feng</p>
<p>It is said that there is also an art to scolding people.</p>
<p>I am a fool, and I can't understand the meaning of this sentence. So, Lao Zhang volunteered to explain it to me.</p>
<p>"For example," he said solemnly, "for example, you are talking with a colleague who is in a similar situation to you, and everyone is complaining about the hardships of life, resenting the rising prices and no increase in income. At that time, if you pat your colleague on the arm, and sincerely and solemnly say to him——</p>
<p>Damn it, that stingy section chief! He never increases our allowance, what are we supposed to eat? Drink air! Drink wind! Seeing how stingy he is, he will never accomplish great things! … If you, old brother, were the section chief, huh! Then everyone would have a way to survive! Isn't that right? You, old brother, have always been tolerant and generous!</p>
<p>——As you speak, you have to smile, and at the end, you have to give him a thumbs up. Then, then your colleague will be very happy, and he will laugh with you!" Lao Zhang stopped here and took a breath.</p>
<p>But I'm still at a loss. What does this have to do with the phrase "There is also an art to scolding people"?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang saw my confused face and knew that I hadn't understood yet. So, he first made a face at me, then showed his gold-inlaid teeth, sprayed saliva, and said to me:</p>
<p>"Old brother, don't you understand? You scolded the section chief and flattered your colleague, isn't that killing two birds with one stone? If you only scold the section chief, that's too dangerous. In case your colleague messes with you and goes to the section chief to expose your shortcomings, then you, then you… , you understand yourself. Now, you flattered him, so he won't mess with you behind your back, and you yourself, after scolding, can finally let out a breath of anger…" Lao Zhang is a "big guy" and spoke breathlessly. I really felt sorry for him because he sincerely taught me "the art of scolding people." He continued:</p>
<p>"Moreover… and on the other hand, you also scolded that colleague. After scolding him, he still agrees and laughs with you, thinking that you flattered him!" Lao Zhang actually laughed loudly, and I even saw a small piece of green vegetable leaf in the gap next to his gold-inlaid tooth.</p>
<p>I was even more at a loss.</p>
<p>Lao Zhang stopped laughing, made another face, patted my shoulder again, and said</p>
<p>"Old brother, how can you not understand? Your colleague is just a small clerk like you, and he is not a section chief, and he will… he will never be a section chief… When you say that, aren't you also scolding him, scolding him? And he's still happy!" Lao Zhang laughed again, laughing until he couldn't catch his breath.</p>
<p>I laughed with him too. But, immediately I felt confused again… I couldn't help but ask Lao Zhang, "Is this the art of scolding people? But, but we don't have that damn section chief in our shop!"</p>
<p>Lao Zhang laughed even harder and fell on the sofa, unable to stand up.</p>
<p>"You're really a fool!" Finally, Lao Zhang barely suppressed his laughter and said.</p>
<p>I also felt that I was a bit of a fool, and after working so hard for so long, I still couldn't understand the meaning of these few words. I had no choice but to reward the hard-working Lao Zhang with a smile. Suddenly, I remembered that Lao Zhang scolded me "fool" but I still smiled at him. "Damn it! This is the art of scolding people!" I thought.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Begonia <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(4) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>"What do you want to eat?"</p>
<p>Although Begonia himself was not a fat man, he also knew the relationship between food and fat men. Four meals a day were absolutely necessary for Zhao Si, especially when he needed him to run errands. Eating his fill was the top priority, so without waiting for him to say anything else, he hurriedly asked the waiter to make twenty pot stickers and bring a bowl of pork noodles.</p>
<p>Zhao Si stopped yawning.</p>
<p>"Third Master's matter, I heard that it was done very interestingly, like a farce. Haven't you heard Seventh Master talk about it?" While waiting for the noodles and pot stickers, Zhao Si suddenly asked this question out of the blue.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you know about his marrying that concubine from Tianjin?"</p>
<p>"No." Begonia said without the slightest interest.</p>
<p>"According to a friend," Zhao Si was most happy to mind other people's business. "That woman was completely tricked by Third Master!"</p>
<p>Begonia only gave a cold smile. Although he didn't know about this matter, judging from Yuan Baofan's usual behavior, how could he not do such a thing? Tricking was still being polite. When he was happy, he would have to rob people!</p>
<p>"I heard that Seventh Master's photo was used for the match."</p>
<p>"Seventh Master's photo?" This made Begonia feel very strange! Because he knew Yuan Shaowen's character, and he firmly believed that no matter what, he would not help his uncle.</p>
<p>"I don't know if it's true." Zhao Si stretched his head out the door to take a look, wondering why the pot stickers and noodles hadn't come yet. "I just heard people say that that woman is very fierce, a female student. Later, she quarreled with Third Master until the sky turned upside down, and she refused to give up. Seventh Master also blamed Third Master for being wrong. That night, he slipped back to Beijing, unwilling to mediate for him again. Thanks to Governor Hu and some officials here, who tried their best to mediate, the matter was settled. As a result, Third Master also agreed to her three major demands. I guess the reason why he didn't go back to Beijing to live with the first wife must have been stipulated like that!"</p>
<p>"In that case, Seventh Master's photo was probably also tricked away by Third Master." Begonia nodded and said.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Zhao Si hurriedly followed his tone and said, "Seventh Master is much more decent than Third Master!"</p>

<h3 id="e82">"Sweeping Snow" and "Peeling Skin" <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>"Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs." This is a "God-given teaching"; we are "eating according to God," so naturally we shouldn't have any behavior that goes against God; therefore, just "sweep the snow."</p>
<p>But now there are people who don't even sweep the "snow"!</p>
<p>Not sweeping the "snow" is still a minor matter; who knows that when people see that you don't sweep, they will sweep all the "snow" to your door! If everyone sweeps, day after day, wouldn't it be to "cover up death" and then stop?</p>
<p>Or, you think that once the "sunlight" comes out, the "snow" will "melt" by itself; however, before it comes out, it is not just "not melting"!</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even so, you can still "barely survive" for a while; but nothing is worse than "choking your throat and caressing your back"……</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says: "Stripping the bed with the skin, it is close to disaster." Now that it is close to the pain of "skinning", how can we turn a blind eye and let people "peel" us?</p>

<p>So the movie theater pulls the iron door tightly all day long, the theater tickets are sold out every other day, so the hotel rooms are noisy and full (you can't spend money, book a month in advance!), so</p>
<p>Madness, the enthusiastic "happy to enjoy happiness"!</p>
<p>However, the more people who are "happy to enjoy happiness", the more people seem to be "doomed to be unlucky". Look: the "full" refugee camps and beggar shelters (this place is not worthy of being called full.) The "daily statistics" of the hungry and frozen (today's newspaper can add this column, alas!), the days of welcoming the God of Wealth must be counted, the suicides are committing suicide with "methods" that are constantly innovating…… The "mold" that is discharged from the "Adventureland" that "should" "fall" also created a void…… (Unprecedented what, clumsy me, can't say)</p>
<p>Therefore, in short, the more people who are "happy to enjoy happiness", the more people who are "doomed to be unlucky" will follow, but, but the people on the isolated island are always these people, right? When the "unlucky" are finished, how will the "happy" enjoy it?</p>
