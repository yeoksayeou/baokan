<p>華盛頓　日外相忪岡歐洲之行、雖報紙不予軍視、然此間政界對此行之理由與其可能的結果、現仍加以討論、據一般意見則尙無所聞、據華盛頓所得遠東通訊、近年來政治家挾不願意之情緒、前往德國者、以松岡爲最甚、聞松岡首途以前、自知</p>
<p>維希　關於日本外相松岡洋右報聘德義兩國一事、「時報」頃加以評論云、「茲有各種理由、足資證信日本至少在中日戰爭期間、不願見現行歐戰擴大至遠東、且日本政府對於能吾與蘇聯成立協定一層、亦復毫無把握、但日本亦有因非本身所得控制之理山、而被迫採取行動之可能、例如履行德義日三國同盟條約所負義務或採取步驟、以阻止他國在太平洋上取得優勢、皆足以迫使日本出則允足以促使日本與軸心國史謀密切、並在三國同盟條的範圍之內、決定對美態度、總之日本外相松岡洋右此次聘問德義兩國之行、意義甚爲重大、各全能國家之聯帶一歡關係、暨三國在締結同盟時之精神、均將於此重言以申明之」云、（十丸日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>柏林　據消息靈通方面稱、昨日蘇聯大使第根諾索夭之訪問德外部、係屬常例、據德負責方面稱、此事大概與日外相松岡來柏林之事有關云、（二十日海通社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德國駐日大使奧特少將、返國述職、於咋晚抵達莫芳昨於遊歷馬來半島之怡保中、表示架對其軍隊之力量、甚爲信任、樸芳稱於確信馬來亞即在目前、亦可表演一眞正之好戲、馬來亞現已足可自衛、但予非至獲有一切、吾人所需之軍隊及軍備時、決不心滿意足、樸芳於檢閱志願軍時謂、雖將來尙有更多之軍隊抵此、然仍不能减輕馬來志願軍之防衛責任云、（二十哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>東京　巴達維亞日官方消息、此行殆無結果、縱有之、亦復細微已甚、無足介意、此間所接未證實之消息、謂軸心國不期望莫斯科在松岡過境之時、有何發展、惟稍緩德義日將召集一度會議而請蘇聯派員出席、屆時軸心國希望日蘇妥洽、可以議定、而於松岡歸途中、在英斯科簽字、至於蘇聯將有何種要求、以爲援助軸心國之代價、不能有所成就、以迭福於日本、渠所以不得不行者、實爲外務省中以大橋爲領袖並以軍閥爲後援之有勢力派所逼迫云、往來美國與葡京間之美船、每星期一次放洋時、輒有日本軍官十五人至二十人附之前往、甫抵葡京、即乘德機飛赴德國、足徵德日軍人密切接觸之說非無因也、（廿日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c5">設立蘇維埃地帶 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>在日本國內，歷年反蘇維埃最慷慨激昂的，往年主張與德義簽訂反共公約最出力的，乃至近年代日本軍部宣傳謂侵華爲了反共防共云云最肆其詭辯的，誰都知道是東京國民新聞，他是日本極端國家主義派的機關報。誰知昨日東京電訊，謂國民新聞於表示希望中日戰爭儘速解決之外，竟然謂「日本可以考慮在中國內地設立獨立之蘇維埃地帶」。這不是咄咄怪事嗎！</p>
<p>太幼稚了。他想以此爲香餌，誘惑蘇俄，騙他上鈎，成立妥協。他想以此蜜餞砒霜，鉤引中國共產黨，促進中共糾紛，分化中國團結。反正是中國的內地，設立獨立的蘇維埃地帶，於他無損；反正兼併中國至少在目前已經證明其不可能了，落得慷他人之慨，送一筆厚禮；反正他有他所處心積慮的計畫，在中國姑且設立無論幾個五色繽紛的地帶，何關宏旨。他幻覺種種：一以爲中國對日戰爭不是中國全民族的自覺，而共黨所鼓煽；一以為中國不屈膝不妥協皆不因為中國爭獨立自由與主權領土的完整，而因爲共黨的挾持；一以爲辦到了中共背離其國族，中國便將分崩離散；一以爲可望蘇聯不再繼續援華，亦即可望中國不能繼續作戰；因此種種幻覺，遂曼然以「日本可以考慮在中國內地設立獨立之蘇維埃來希望中日戰爭的所謂儘速解決。然而幼稚得太可憐了。要是中國容許他的內地設立獨立的蘇維埃地帶，則早已由中國容許，更何待日本考慮？獨立的中華民國尙且成爲日本侵犯的目標，誰復希罕先經日本考慮後的獨立？每一個幼稚傢伙必自以爲唯有自己最聰明，而以每一別人爲笨伯，日本現在以爲蘇聯與中共是會被利用的工具。於此却可窺見這一次日外相松岡往柏林，將挽了德國人向莫斯科許些什麼願。亦可窺見日本企圖不顧一切，消弭了後顧之憂而悍然南進。調整蘇日國交，解決中日戰爭眞是日本南進的理想條件啊。</p>
<p>日本南進與北進，不是分岐的兩政策，而是政策的兩方面；故目前亟亟於調整對蘇關係，結束在華軍事，並非改變其北進政策而南進。如果中國不戰，則日本北進的初步已成功了；如果中國不戰且蘇德不妥協，則日本威脅蘇聯的北進第二步或已發動了；如果中國屈服，而蘇德妥協，且歐戰繼作，或日本尙未武力侵華而歐戰遽作，則日本南進將不但已經發動殆或已有豐富收穫。總之，他的南北進之間，具有密切的因果消長關係。他不幸而遭遇了中國英勇的長期作戰，雖有大好的南進機會，却爲目前的國力所不許。擺在眼前的是大好機會，擺在嘴邊的是幅員遼闊，土著落後，物資豐饒，天時燠暖，最宜於日本拓殖而爲歷來最所垂涎，却不敢動手，無法染指的南洋。在他本意，以爲得了中國，實力充沛，然後經營南進，則誰敢攖其鋒。故發動了侵華。到現在，又以爲得了南洋，則侵華所耗的國力瞬息便得弭補，屆時又誰敢攖其鋒。故不妨以彼所謂解決中日戰爭來暫時保留殘損的中國，以設立所謂獨立的蘇維埃地帶來暫時穩住蘇俄，以待南進凱旋之後，對中蘇兩國大兇圍完成之時，探囊而取。總之，他即使辦到北顧無憂，亦祗是暫停北進而非放棄北進。</p>
<p>這是簡單而必然的。因此，國民新聞所示意，松岡外相所示惠，作用不夠。</p>

<p>紗巿仍不離徘徊之境、良以客方銷路未能接踵而來、港幫採辦不及上日之旺、同時外匯亦屬寗靜、所以人心較爲軟化、但多數心理望高、因爲大家買幾包、當然看升可盈餘、然環境不能如願也、至於要下墜亦難、因拉力殊强、由此遂呈進退維谷之局面、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百二十四元、低價爲一千四百十三四元、午後初做一千叫百十六七元、就此而論紗市、恐有長期間之廻旋也、</p>

<h3 id="c68">節减電流後 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 司馬駿</p>
<p>廠長到辦公室，寫字檯上已放着一封長形信壳的英文信，幸虧還好，裏面有中文對照的。</p>
<p>廠長皺皺眉，重複的再看了一遍，總之，還不是增加電費。</p>
<p>他心亂如麻，一切的事都繞緊着腦子，彷彿越繞越緊；貨物都已定出，顧客每天盈門，可是廠絲六千元，人造絲三千餘，而且又是缺貨—簡直沒有。</p>
<p>雖然這是好生意，但來路斷絕，動煞他的腦筋，加上節减電流的事，更使他坐立不停。</p>
<p>他燃着了烟，倒在沙發上，想：「本來用電每月二萬字，節减一來，要打上一個七折，祇能用電一萬四千，可是這六千字呢？三倍，三倍！」</p>
<p>他好像很痛苦的猛抽了口氣，「總之開支又要加大！</p>
<p>騫地，他從沙發上跳起來，撳了一下雷鈴到工塲，心神忐忑地，踱着步。</p>
<p>工務主仟走進辦公室的時候，廠長怪客氣的揩揩沙發椅「請坐，坐！」自己也一屁股挨到沙發上，用商量的口吻對工務主仟說：</p>
<p>「電流已實行要减，本廠每月祗少要用過六千字，我想白天的電燈可多關幾只。但是馬達，我想將小馬達一律改用大馬達，你以爲怎樣？」</p>
<p>工務主任沒有料到會發生這樣突然的問題。他想着工塲改用大馬達的困難，於是回答說：</p>
<p>「這　大成功，改用大馬達危險性重，而且，房屋，地位都不配，假使改用，這筆裝製費用也很大！」</p>
<p>廠長像噴上了一桶冷水，但，「改大馬達電費可省呀！」</p>
<p>「省常固然省，但一切先決條件不能够。」</p>
<p>廠長始終不相信，他拿起了電話，叫電氣顧問急速來一趟。</p>
<p>電氣顧問米後，廠長陪他到工塲裏視察了一下，回到辦公室，就問：「這樣改一下要多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>「至少三萬元！」</p>
<p>廠長呷呷嘴，搖搖頭，「不得了，這樣貴！」</p>
<p>電氣顧問却說：「不貴呢，過幾日說不定還要漲！」</p>
<p>廠長總感到這一筆浩大的費用合不算，作罷了罷？可是這意外六千字三倍費用怎麼辦呢？節省，節省，無論如何不能節省六千字呀！</p>
<p>道一晚上，他沒有睡覺，一切「辦法」在他腦子里打滾，終於滾出一個辦法來了。第二天老淸早就趕到辦法室，先把節减電流信再看了一遍，他叫過賬房先生：「你去擬張草稿，因節减電流本廠不得已自本月二十日起將一切貨物增加三倍！」</p>
<p>「不是剛漲過價嗎？賬房先生問。</p>
<p>「你看電費不是漲三倍呀！」</p>
<p>下午，又逼緊着印刷所將印刷品拿來，賬房先生埋頭查地址，客戶，寫信封，廠長也立在旁邊，催促着送貨員：</p>
<p>「今晚信要送完，明天一律新價！」</p>
<h3 id="c69">讀虞氏「啟事」有感 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 齊爲德</p>
<p>虞洽卿先生到香港去了，臨行時登載了巨幅啟事，將購米的來蹤去跡以及盈虧利潤詳細地開了一張「淸單」，雖然日期只到本年一月十九日爲止，及售出項　有「愼記」「趙慶記」等戶名，尙不免使人懷疑者外，但「能在短時期內，陸續購米至二十萬擔之多」，確是「於滬市糧食問題當有涓埃之助」，何况曾「先　墊款　一千萬元以上」，以及「認助三北平糶會虧耗三十四萬九千八百八十四元九角五分，又捐助寗波平糶會十萬兀」，即以凈盈的二十萬零四百三十四一角二分「移充」，更「補足不敷之數」！虞氏自謂「誠信未孚，致獲求全之毀」，實在使「未明眞相」者「彌目增慚」！</p>
<p>這「事件」現在當然是成爲陳跡了，虞氏的功過也可以不辯自明了，不過民食的隱憂並不因虞氏之行而得到解决，甚至反而愈形嚴重，正如虞氏臨別贈言所云「源源接濟，仍有賴於衆擎」，然而像虞氏這樣爲全市四百萬人口謀福利的，尙且「流言四起」，那末，眞正「誠信未孚」之流怎當得起這付軍擔？</p>
<p>不過話也得說回來，在這艱難困難的年頭，也不是求功過的時候，祗要所做的事，「撫躬循省」，確實是爲社會國家謀福利的，儘可不顧毀譽，努力以赴，我們希望後起者能在這最商的原則下出而負此重任，也好使離開了「第二故鄕」的虞氏安心，而小民亦幸甚焉！</p>

<p>但有一件事却很使秋海棠憂慮，那就是趙玉崑的失蹤。據警察局說，昨天下午已經把他放了，可是直到第二天下午，玉崑還沒有回天津飯店。榮奎跟秋海棠的琴師金大個子兩個人出去找了一晚，把附近所有的小酒店全走遍了，只是不見他的影子。</p>
<p>「不要給那些混混們做了？」趙四昂起着一張胖臉，透出怪緊張的神氣問。</p>
<p>其時他們都在馬金壽的房間裏，這個實際上還不到卅歲的唱鬚生的靑年人，外貌却萎頹得巳像六七十歲的老人了，他的一大半的光陰是消磨在烟榻上的，因爲他的頭銜是譚派鬚生，上台去必須陰陽怪氣，爐火純靑，抽大烟當！」</p>
<p>然是必須具備的條件了！</p>
<p>「這倒不怕！祇要他們不用傢伙，一二十個混混還不够二老板打發咧！」金大個子倚在門框上，右手不停的搔摸着自己的光頭說。</p>
<p>「毒龍難鬥地頭蛇，不要把人家看得太輕了！」趙四却不以爲然。</p>
<p>秋海棠默默地坐在馬金壽的烟榻上，並不表示什麼意見，他知道趙玉崑不但膂力强大，身子滑溜，而且爲人很機靈，照理不致會在那些光棍面前裁跟斗，而且事實上一時也的確無法找到他，看來祇好等回京以後再說了。　（六〇）</p>

<p>— 程冰奴</p>
<p>露茜鮑兒在「迷樓飛燕」裏有很好的成就，因此由她主演的這部「百花爭春」引起了我的注意。「百花爭春」的原名叫Too　Mlany　Gilrs，和的中文譯名一樣，也是頗有生意眼的。不過「女人太多」云云，似乎與劇情不合，雖則這片裹的女人不好算少，甚至可以說一個男人有十個女人，但作為本片主角的露茜鮑兒，却有四個男子在一同追求她。</p>
<p>原來露茜飽兒是一個富翁的女兒，她將繼承她父親鉅大的資產，所以她父親雇了四個强壯的男子去當她保鑣，結果和其中之一的李却卡爾遜發生了戀愛。這樣的故事，眞是匪夷所思，我想卽使在社會情形和我們不同的美國，也不致眞正發生這樣的事實。</p>
<p>但除却這個牽强附會的故事之外，「百花爭春」如果有什麼「優點」的話，那末便是熱鬧，風趣，有歌，有舞，有年靑男女學生那股不可遏抑的熱情。可是，作為本片背景的某大學，如果沒有那塲足球比賽，我幾乎懷疑它是「跳舞塲」了。</p>
<p>講到歌舞，本片導演者無疑地是盡了他最大的力量。幾個大塲面，處理得甚為有勁，安蜜拉和臺西阿那茲所作的侖擺舞，美艷而有熱力，是本片最「出色」的地方，而數十人的大合唱，熱情奔放，雄壯嘹亮，確也動人，主角露茜飽兒，一貫地妖冶嫵媚，戲雖不多，但演得頗為風趣，尤其是她和男中角李却卡爾遜由疑而愛，由愛而悄的幾個階段，描摹得十分細緻。</p>
<p>此片雖為雷電華公司集合多數歌舞人村集合而攝的「巨構」，但就趣味講，似乎尙不及該公司的「娜娜小姐」，可見劇本的編製，對於演出的形式是多麼需要呀。</p>

<p>張蒼虬道：「只要不是敷毒藥的東西，俺的行囊中帶有金創良藥，少停回去給許兄敷上一些，便可早愈的。」李信瞧張蒼虬英武豪莽，着實可愛，便要許靖和張蒼虬馬上到他莊裏去一聚。許靖因為家中無人，這事已告一段落，急欲回去，便答應李信，明日他邀了張蒼虬到李家莊上來拜望。李信遂冉三叮囑許靖等不可失約。張蒼虬也一口答應道：「明天俺一準來拜訪李爺便是，俺們再會吧。」便一手將許靖扶起，扶掖着他向李陳兩人點了點頭便走了。李信也說一聲「恕送，明天再見。」同陳飛等衆人回去。張蒼虬伴着許靖，回到許家。許靖到他房裏坐下，張蒼虬便去取出金創藥給他敷上患處，重行包紮一過。二人因時候已近五鼓，也不多講話，各自去安睡。次日大家起身，張蒼虬便問許靖傷處如何。許靖答道：「敷藥後就止痛了，不日自會好的。」張蒼虬笑道：「昨夜那姓陳的雖然徒勞往返，但是却使你無端受了傷，我眞對不起你。」許靖道：「道是我自已不慎，以致受人暗算，與壯士何尤。古人云，謾藏誨盜，我們雖沒有金銀珠寶，却有了這些刀劍和馬，被識貨的人冷眼窺見，便發生道麼一回事了，眞是使人料想不到的。」張蒼虬笑道：「那位李信究竟是何許人物？他的門客怎麼也有鷄嗚狗盜之流？許靖答道：「李信是這裏的武舉人，性好遊伙，略知武勢，和我是一樣的。但他個儻不羣，喜歡交遊，一縣的人大都認識他。我和他也是朋友，時常到他莊裏去奕棋談天的。他那裏門下士很多，文武皆有。昨夜來的姓陳的，武藝也是很好。若非張壯士本領高出於他，他也不會輕易敗北的啊。這樣可見你是一位英雄，無怪李信只一見面已要請你到他莊裏去了。」　（一七）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Guo Taiqi's Alert Speech: China's Combat Strength Increases, Resolving Never to Accept Any Aggressive Peace, General Counter-Offensive Period Will Be Sooner Than Expected <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London - At a banquet held by the "Waste Border Society" in London yesterday, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi delivered a speech stating, "The world should not mistakenly believe that Japan has slightly abandoned its aggression, making a big mistake. Japan is now only waiting for an opportunity to cooperate with its Axis partners to divide the spoils of war. I can assure you that any peace proposal, no matter how good it may seem on the surface, whose intention is to help Japan escape the quagmire in order to engage in aggression elsewhere, China will never listen to it. China has never been conquered and is more unconquerable than before. We are more resilient than before and more resilient than the world expects. God blesses China with an outstanding leader. China's Chiang Kai-shek is like Britain's Prime Minister Churchill and America's President Roosevelt. Since the outbreak of the war, China's military strength has more than doubled, and various military equipment is sufficient for self-supply. However, aircraft and artillery, which are necessary for the general counter-offensive, must be transported from abroad. The time for China's general counter-offensive may be sooner than most people expect. In reality, China is the first to bear the brunt of mechanized aggression. Aggression cannot be stopped by theory, and China is at the forefront of resisting this abhorrent ideology. Although we have been fighting alone for more than two years, we have always felt that we are fighting not only for ourselves but also for others. We revealed Japan's aggression to the world ten years ago, but the world is only now awakening."</p>
<p>Amazing Development of Natural Resources Is More Important Than Any War Outcome</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo did not acknowledge the occurrence of friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but said that the Japanese propaganda was distorted and untrue. He was confident that the Communist Party now understands the paramount importance of internal unity and will continue to provide the government with cooperation and assistance, as it promised at the beginning of the war. After recounting the Chinese army's achievements in the past six months, Ambassador Guo urged the audience to pay attention to the amazing development of natural resources in southwest and northwest China since the Chinese government moved to Chongqing, saying that the consequences of this matter, Liu Yu's future influence in Asia, is more important than any war effect. Ambassador Guo has long been known in London as an orator. This speech was very lively and well-received. The audience was very large, and they all considered this speech to be the most insightful and illuminating, with applause erupting frequently, especially when mentioning the leaders of the three countries and when the Chinese army caused millions of Japanese troops to be mired in China and unable to extricate themselves.

<p>Cowles' Final Report Submitted to President Roosevelt Yesterday</p>
<p>Washington - Roosevelt's special representative to China, Cowles, submitted the final part of his report on his visit to China to President Roosevelt today. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - It is rumored that the Japanese military, due to the United States potentially expanding its aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act, will establish a military cabinet after the collapse of the Konoe cabinet in July, seeking peace with China to eliminate the effectiveness of American aid to China. Foreign observers here said that when President Roosevelt's advisor Cowles visited China last month, he drafted a specific economic plan. After that, China can not only rely on the Lend-Lease Act but also obtain greater assistance from the United States based on this plan. The purpose of the Cowles plan is to build a free Chinese economy and monetary system, thereby increasing the exchange rate of the legal tender and reducing prices. In addition, there is one more thing that the Japanese military must deal with, that is, the improvement of the Burma Road's freight. After the improvement, the transport of American supplies to China and the transport of Chinese tungsten ore and tung oil to the United States will all increase. (International News Agency, 20th)</p>

Accompanying Mr. Gauss were his wife and son, but his family will not accompany him to his post. Mr. Gauss stated that relations between the United States and Australia have greatly improved since the mutual establishment of embassies, and the two countries have received considerable economic and military benefits. He saw two squadrons of American warships visiting New Zealand and Australia en route in Pago Pago (the capital of Samoa). This move greatly demonstrates the unity and friendship between the United States and Australia. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Matsuoka's Trip to Europe: Almost No Achievements to Speak Of, Domestic Strongmen Forced Him to Do This, No Confidence in Concluding an Agreement with the Soviet Union <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Although the newspapers are not paying much attention to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Europe, political circles here are still discussing the reasons for this trip and its possible results. According to general opinion, nothing has been heard yet. According to Far East dispatches received in Washington, Matsuoka is the most reluctant politician to visit Germany in recent years. It is said that before Matsuoka set off, he knew</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's reciprocal visit to Germany and Italy, "Le Temps" recently commented, "There are various reasons to believe that Japan, at least during the Sino-Japanese War, does not want to see the current European war expand to the Far East, and the Japanese government is also not confident in being able to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. However, Japan may also be forced to take action due to reasons beyond its control, such as fulfilling its obligations under the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, or taking steps to prevent other countries from gaining an advantage in the Pacific. All of these are sufficient to force Japan to act, and they are also sufficient to promote close cooperation between Japan and the Axis powers and to determine its attitude towards the United States within the scope of the Tripartite Pact. In short, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's visit to Germany and Italy is of great significance. The relationship between all powerful countries and the spirit of the three countries when they concluded the alliance will all be reiterated." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to German Foreign Ministry officials, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will not meet with dignitaries from other European countries during his visit to Berlin. It is expected that Matsuoka will arrive in Berlin next week to discuss matters related to Germany and Italy. Therefore, he will not engage in any negotiations in Moscow, but he will still pay attention to his talks with Soviet leaders because the Japanese side is eager to conclude a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression pact. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to well-informed sources, Soviet Ambassador to Germany Dekanozov's visit to the German Foreign Ministry yesterday was routine. According to responsible German sources, this matter is probably related to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Moscow - German Ambassador to Japan Ott, who returned to his country to report on his work, arrived in Moscow last night. While traveling through Ipoh in the Malay Peninsula yesterday, he expressed great confidence in the strength of his army. Park Fang said he was confident that Malaya could put on a real good show even at the moment. Malaya is now sufficient to defend itself, but it will not be satisfied until it has obtained all the troops and military equipment it needs. Park Fang said when inspecting the volunteer army that even if more troops arrive here in the future, it will not reduce the Malayan volunteer army's responsibility for defense. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to Batavia Japanese official sources, this trip is almost fruitless, and even if there are results, they are very minor and not worth mentioning. Unconfirmed news received here said that the Axis powers do not expect any developments in Moscow during Matsuoka's transit. However, the Axis powers will convene a meeting and invite the Soviet Union to send a representative. At that time, the Axis powers hope that a Japanese-Soviet agreement can be reached and signed in Moscow on Matsuoka's return trip. As for what kind of demands the Soviet Union will make as the price for assisting the Axis powers, it cannot be achieved, which is difficult for Japan. The reason why he had to go was that he was forced by powerful factions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led by Oohashi and backed by warlords. Every time American ships traveling between the United States and Lisbon set sail once a week, 15 to 20 Japanese military officers would attach themselves to them. As soon as they arrived in Lisbon, they would take German planes to Germany, which shows that the close contact between German and Japanese military personnel is not without reason. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>It is difficult to say at present whether all these possibilities of acting against one's will will be realized. However, it is very clear that the Japanese government is deeply concerned about the joint action taken by the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific. In addition, there is another factor that may drag Japan into the vortex of the European war, which is the United States expanding its aid to the United Kingdom in accordance with the "Democracy Aid Act." In addition, President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech stating that the aid program also applies to China. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will stay in Moscow for one, two, or three days in order to pay his respects to the Soviet government on behalf of the Japanese government. The spokesman also said that Matsuoka's stay in Moscow is only because he is passing through Moscow on his way to Germany and Italy. The schedule of Matsuoka's activities in Moscow has not yet been determined, but he may meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to reminisce about the past. Matsuoka's mission is only Moscow. Those who welcomed him at the station included German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg, Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa, and many other members of the German and Japanese embassies. Ott left Moscow today and hurried back to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency)</p>

The above-mentioned naval officers will be in the capacity of observers and are not American diplomatic or consular personnel. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>In Japan, the one who has been most generous and impassioned in opposing the Soviet Union over the years, the one who has worked the hardest to advocate for the signing of an anti-communist pact with Germany and Italy in the past, and even the one who has most unscrupulously propagated the Japanese military's claim in recent times that the invasion of China is for the purpose of opposing and preventing communism, everyone knows is the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun. It is the organ of the Japanese extremist nationalist faction. Who knew that yesterday's Tokyo telegram said that the Kokumin Shimbun, in addition to expressing its hope that the Sino-Japanese War would be resolved as soon as possible, actually said that "Japan can consider establishing an independent Soviet zone in mainland China." Isn't this a strange thing!</p>
<p>Too naive. It wants to use this as a fragrant bait to lure Soviet Russia, trick it into taking the bait, and reach a compromise. It wants to use this honeyed poison to lure the Chinese Communist Party, promote CCP disputes, and divide Chinese unity. Anyway, it is the interior of China, and establishing an independent Soviet zone will not harm it; anyway, annexing China has at least proven to be impossible at present, so it is better to be generous with other people's things and give away a generous gift; anyway, it has its own carefully planned plans, and it does not matter how many colorful zones are temporarily established in China. It has various illusions: one, that China's war against Japan is not the awakening of the entire Chinese nation, but the incitement of the Communist Party; one, that China's refusal to surrender and compromise is not because China is fighting for independence, freedom, and the integrity of sovereignty and territory, but because of the Communist Party's coercion; one, that if the CCP can be made to betray its nation, China will disintegrate; one, that it is hoped that the Soviet Union will no longer continue to aid China, and thus it is hoped that China will not be able to continue fighting; because of these various illusions, it is leisurely hoping for the so-called speedy resolution of the Sino-Japanese War by saying that "Japan can consider establishing an independent Soviet in mainland China." However, it is pitifully naive. If China were to allow its interior to establish an independent Soviet zone, it would have been allowed by China long ago, so why wait for Japan to consider it? The independent Republic of China has already become the target of Japanese aggression, who would want independence after being considered by Japan first? Every naive fellow must think that only they are the smartest and that everyone else is a fool. Japan now thinks that the Soviet Union and the CCP are tools that can be used. From this, we can get a glimpse of what kind of promises the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will ask the Germans to make to Moscow on this trip to Berlin. We can also get a glimpse of Japan's attempt to eliminate its worries and advance south without regard for everything. Adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations and resolving the Sino-Japanese War are truly ideal conditions for Japan's southward advance.</p>
<p>Japan's southward advance and northward advance are not two divergent policies, but two aspects of the same policy; therefore, the current eagerness to adjust relations with the Soviet Union and end the military operations in China is not to change its northward advance policy to a southward advance. If China does not fight, then the initial stage of Japan's northward advance has succeeded; if China does not fight and the Soviet Union and Germany do not compromise, then the second step of Japan's northward advance to threaten the Soviet Union may have been launched; if China surrenders, and the Soviet Union and Germany compromise, and the European war continues, or if Japan has not yet militarily invaded China and the European war suddenly breaks out, then Japan's southward advance will not only have been launched, but may already have abundant harvests. In short, there is a close causal relationship between his southward and northward advance. He unfortunately encountered China's heroic long-term warfare, and although there is a great opportunity for southward advance, it is not allowed by the current national strength. What is in front of him is a great opportunity, and what is on his lips is a vast territory, backward natives, abundant resources, warm weather, most suitable for Japanese colonization, and the most coveted region in history, but he dares not act and cannot touch it: the South Seas. In his original intention, he thought that if he got China, his strength would be abundant, and then if he managed the South Seas, who would dare to challenge him? So he launched the invasion of China. Now, he thinks that if he gets the South Seas, the national strength consumed by the invasion of China will be compensated in an instant, and then who will dare to challenge him? Therefore, it is possible to temporarily retain the damaged China with what he calls resolving the Sino-Japanese War, temporarily stabilize Soviet Russia by establishing the so-called independent Soviet zone, and wait until the southward advance is triumphant and the encirclement of China and the Soviet Union is completed, at which time it will be easy to take them. In short, even if he manages to eliminate his worries, he is only temporarily stopping the northward advance, not abandoning it.</p>
<p>This is simple and inevitable. Therefore, the Kokumin Shimbun's suggestion and Foreign Minister Matsuoka's gift are not enough.</p>

<h3 id="e10">US House Passes Military Expenditure for Lend-Lease to Aid China, Britain, and Greece to Complete Aircraft and Various War Equipment for Democratic Countries to Resist Aggression <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives, by a decisive majority (with 336 votes to 55), passed a huge appropriation bill, which appropriates US$7 billion for lend-lease military equipment to aid the central government, Britain, and Greece. This will enable the We President to implement his "full force" aid program. The bill will facilitate the construction of huge quantities of aircraft and various war equipment, as well as various raw materials and other major supplies to aid democratic countries in their fight against the Axis powers. The bill will be submitted to the Senate, and the Senate Budget Committee will begin studying the bill today. Senate Majority Leader Barkley said that he hopes the Senate can begin debating the bill early next week. Barkley also predicted that the Senate will be able to hold a final vote after two or three days of discussion. According to reliable sources, non-interventionists have not planned to launch an attack on this bill. In the House of Representatives, the unity of the Republican and Democratic parties has broken any attempts to prevent the appropriation of funds for the lend-lease bill before the bill was passed. Today, Senate leaders also said that any attempts in the Senate to reduce the amount of funds for the lend-lease bill will also be defeated. In the House of Representatives, an amendment was proposed, advocating reducing the amount of funds for the US to equip weapons and ammunition from US$1,343,000,000 to US$959,000,000. This amendment was rejected by the House of Representatives by 162 votes to 63. In addition, several other amendments proposed by some people were also rejected. When this US$7 billion appropriation bill was voted on, as many as 336 people voted in favor, while only 355 people voted against it. This bill shows that Congress is implementing the policy it determined when it passed the Lend-Lease Act. From this point of view, the House of Representatives' move can be said to be another step in making the United States the arsenal of democratic countries. According to President Luo, after signing the Lend-Lease Act, he asked Congress to immediately appropriate funds. The president's proposal to Congress was accompanied by an analysis table from Budget Director Smith, which showed that the amount of US$7 billion could be used until June 30, 1942.

At present, no ships have been transferred to Britain. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>

It is said that "there is no doubt that the President will do his best to aid Britain, but I have not seen naval strength weakening as a result, especially in the Pacific." Democratic Senator Thomas shared this view, saying, "No matter what the Lend-Lease Act requires of the US fleet, full strength will be maintained in the Pacific to prevent emergencies."

<p>Chongqing: The First Council Meeting of the Academia Sinica recently resolved that the Academy should consult with the Ministry of Education to jointly initiate a National Academic Conference. As the matter is unprecedented, reporters visited Director Zhu Jiahua of the Academy to inquire about everything. Zhu told the reporter that the Council's resolution to consult with the Ministry of Education to initiate a National Academic Conference is of great significance, approximately as follows: Since the establishment of the Academy fourteen years ago, the foundation for academic research has gradually been established, and some departments have been valued by the academic community in various countries. However, on the whole, the organization of academic research in China is only in the initial stage of establishment. The Academy's human and material resources are limited, and it often feels difficult to independently shoulder the important task of promoting national academics. Therefore, the Academy Council resolved to convene a National Academic Conference, gathering scholars from across the country and inviting foreign scholars to participate, to work together with colleagues from the Academy to promote the effort, so as to awaken the attention of the whole country, create a widespread atmosphere of emphasis on science, and improve the environment for academic research, so that the promotion of national academics can proceed smoothly, so as to promote the rapid advancement of research work. Academic research is not something that can be achieved in a short time, nor is it something that one person or one place can do. There must be a huge amount of funding, complete equipment, and the unanimous enthusiasm of scholars across the country for scientific research, accumulated over a long period of time, before academics can be far-reaching. Secondly, in the current period of resistance, the country and society are in extremely urgent need of the application of science, and science can assist in its application to contribute to its development. Therefore, the Academy must establish contact and cooperation with the government and experts in practical research and technical work across the country, on the one hand, to help them solve problems and benefit the current resistance and construction work, and on the other hand, to promote the development of academic work. The Academy Council is a body that deliberates on national academic education, and the national councilors are all outstanding figures in the Chinese scientific community, with great responsibility. To fulfill its own responsibilities, it is also necessary to gather wisdom and expand work. This is also what is expected from the concerted efforts of the National Academic Conference. As for how this conference will be held and its detailed methods, the Council has appointed personnel to be responsible for drafting them. How to jointly handle it with the Ministry of Education is also being discussed with the Ministry of Education. The date of the conference will be approximately in the spring of next year, so that preparations can be made in a leisurely manner to ensure that it is properly done. (Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The US YWCA recently presented a triangular brooch to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The gift was specially presented by YWCA Secretary Hayes in front of Generalissimo Chiang, US Ambassador Johnson, and many important officials and their families. It is reported that the women who have received this gift in the world are US President Roosevelt's wife and Queen Elizabeth of England. Now Madame Chiang is the third person. However, the same brooches are now sold in the United States, and the proceeds are used for relief work by the YWCAs of China and Britain. When presenting the brooch, Ms. Hayes said that the triangle on the brooch represents the three democratic countries of China, Britain, and the United States. Those American women who buy the same brooch, in view of the fact that this item is being presented to three famous women in the world, will surely recognize that it has special significance. "I respectfully represent the US YWCA in presenting this brooch to Madame. We feel that Madame is united with us Americans, fighting together for justice, peace, and righteousness." When Madame Chiang received the brooch, she said that the brooch was a gift from the United States to Chinese women, and said that Ms. Hayes recognized that the triangle on the brooch represents the democratic countries. "We have obtained it, and I am extremely grateful. I hope that these three sister republics will work together to seek final victory. This final victory is the victory of justice, freedom, and international cooperation." (United Associated Press, 20th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: On the 20th, twelve Japanese planes raided Sichuan from Hubei, reaching Suining, and strafed with machine guns twice. Seeing that the Chinese were prepared, they immediately fled eastward, and strafed with machine guns again in Liangshan and Wushan on the eastward flight. The Chinese suffered no damage. (Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, it was reported that nine Japanese light bombers were rapidly flying towards Chongqing. An air raid alert was issued here at 9:50 a.m., and an emergency alert was issued half an hour later. However, the Japanese planes did not appear. According to previous reports, the Japanese planes were flying towards Tongliang, 50 kilometers northwest of Chongqing. Later, a telegram was received from Tongliang, stating that no bombs were dropped. It is estimated that the Japanese planes were trying to lure the Chinese planes into battle in order to first determine the strength of the defending forces before launching an attack. The air raid alert was lifted at noon. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Board of Directors Decides to Take Swift Action to Stabilize People's Food Supply; French Police Urge Residents to Report Hoarders; Measures to Prevent Rice Hoarding Are Being Planned; Public Warehouse Committee Resolves to Order 80,000 Bags of Warehouse Rice Immediately <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>At 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 19th), the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting. A considerable amount of time was spent discussing the issue of stabilizing the people's food supply. Although no concrete measures were announced as a result of the discussion, the highest authorities of the Municipal Council decided to take swift action, and concrete measures to stabilize the people's food supply will be announced to the public within two or three days. It is understood that the directors present at the meeting the day before yesterday included Chairman Keswick, British Directors Mitchell and Powell, McDonald, Herrle, American Director Minds, Allman, and three of the five Chinese Directors, with Yu Qiaqing and Guo Shun absent. Those present were Chen Qingrui, Yuan Ludeng, and Xi Yushu, as well as one Japanese Director. After discussing the report of the Food Supply Sub-Committee, British Director Mitchell and American Director Minds were put in charge of handling the matter.</p>
<p>Police Authorities Welcome Reports</p>
<p>According to inquiries from sources close to the police authorities in the French Concession, the authorities in the French Concession, in light of the fact that hoarders are accumulating and speculating on food rice, which has a profound impact on the security of the concession, have now decided to impose severe sanctions on those who violate the regulations or hoard. Residents within the concession are welcome to report rice merchants or hoarders who violate regulations or hoard and refuse to sell to the police, and the police will thoroughly punish them.</p>
<p>Hoarders' Minds Already Wary</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council Board of Directors discussed the issue of stabilizing the city's rice supply in detail the day before yesterday and stated that a resolution would soon be decided, rice merchants in this port have been waiting quietly for the announcement of this measure, and speculators have also become wary. Therefore, the price of foreign rice on the black market yesterday continued to fall by one or two yuan per picul. The source of domestic rice was abundant, and the price also continued to fall by two yuan per picul. The amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday reached 25,000 bags. The TaiKoo Shipping Company's Yingchuan Wheel brought 12,184 bags, which have already been unloaded at the Bund wharf in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Arriving Rice Must All Be Supplied to the Market</p>
<p>According to inquiries by the reporter, there are no vacancies for ordering rice shipments to Shanghai for loading in April, which shows that the quantity shipped to Shanghai next month will be large. However, a large number of those ordered are not by those in the rice industry. When merchants try to order, there are no slots available, and individuals who are not in the rice industry are ordering large quantities of rice to ship to Shanghai, which can easily become an act of hoarding and speculation. It is heard that the authorities, in light of this, will negotiate with the rice trading firms in this city to ensure that they can supply the rice merchants in the market with the rice shipments that have been ordered for Shanghai and obtain priority ordering rights.</p>
<p>Transporting Foreign Rice Does Not Have Risks</p>
<p>Some people in this city say that transporting foreign rice from the production area to Shanghai is very risky, but according to investigations by the reporter, from October of last year to the present, no special accidents or dangers have occurred in the transport of foreign rice from the production area to Shanghai. Only sometimes, due to special circumstances, delivery is delayed. Although the rice trading firms in this port collect so-called war risk fees and special fees from fixed customers, it has not been heard that they have paid compensation as a result. Therefore, in the situation of encouraging legitimate rice merchants to order in large quantities and encouraging various groups of citizens to participate in group rice purchases, there is no need to worry too much about the transport of foreign rice to Shanghai at present.</p>
<p>The First Batch of Warehouse Rice Orders 80,000 Bags</p>
<p>The Food Rice Public Warehouse Committee held its fourth committee meeting in the afternoon. Those present included Marshall, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee, Secretary Arcona, Du Pei, chairman of the Food Commission of the French Concession Municipal Council, Secretary Qi Bai, Zhu Yigui, and committee members He Dekui, Xu Jiyu, Ye Fuxiao, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Yuqing. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Order the first batch of 80,000 bags of warehouse rice immediately. (2) Approve the charter of the "Grand" and "Delta" ships for transport, with a freight rate of 95 shillings. (3) Urge the British Consul General's Office to issue shipping permits. (4) After the first batch of 80,000 bags is purchased, continue to order more immediately.</p>

<p>It has come to light that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Public Concession, left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 17th of this month, intending to proceed to Manila for medical treatment. Yesterday, he also published an account of his personal rice dealings, along with a brief overview of the accounts, in the newspapers. Regarding the reasons for Mr. Yu's departure from Shanghai, a reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired yesterday with individuals close to Mr. Yu. It was learned that his departure was solely to seek a radical cure for his illness. Before leaving Shanghai, Mr. Yu had left two draft advertisements, one of which was published yesterday. The other was a notice, which originally stated, "I, in my humble capacity, have been experiencing declining energy and frequent bouts of fever recently. In accordance with my doctor's instructions, I will be temporarily relocating to seek medical treatment to achieve a radical cure. I am deeply sorry that I am unable to bid farewell to all my Chinese and foreign friends individually. As for the various groups and public welfare affairs in which I participate, I entrust them to the respective groups for their continued handling. I hope that this information will allay any concerns. I respectfully announce this." It is rumored that after arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Yu will proceed to Chongqing for a meeting. The central government is extremely concerned about rice prices in Shanghai and must inquire with Mr. Yu in person to clarify the truth. Mr. Yu is also willing to personally visit the authorities to provide a report and dispel any doubts. It is understood that several key figures from the financial and business communities in Shanghai will also inquire about everything.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Fifty French Foreign Legionnaires Return to Shanghai in a Wretched State from Vietnam Following the French Defeat, German Officers Arrive in an Endless Stream, Forcing Them to Do Menial Work and Subjecting Them to Humiliation <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>No Travel Funds Given and No Words of Gratitude Upon Discharge</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that fifty young legionnaires of the French Foreign Legion in the Far East have arrived in Shanghai from Vietnam aboard the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes' Laos. The ship was extremely crowded, like "sardines in a can." After six days at sea, they arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) afternoon in a wretched state and are temporarily quartered in the French military camp.</p>
<p>Enlisted in the French Army for a Year and a Half</p>
<p>Most of these fifty men are Slavs, while the rest are German Jewish refugees and Greeks. There are also two Englishmen. According to them, they previously resided in Shanghai and Tianjin and voluntarily enlisted in the French Foreign Legion at the outbreak of the European war to fight in the Far East. Since being sent to Vietnam, they have served for eighteen months until March 13 of this year, when they were discharged. During this time, they participated in the war against the Japanese and Thai armies and were quite brave. One of them even received the Grand Cross medal.</p>
<p>German Officers Are Brutal and Unreasonable</p>
<p>After the collapse of France last year, they remained in the ranks to defend France's Far Eastern interests, receiving only twenty-five cents a day. However, German non-commissioned officers from French colonies in North Africa were continuously sent to Vietnam to join the Foreign Legion. To this day, 65 percent of the officers in the Vietnamese Foreign Legion are German. They treat their subordinates brutally and unreasonably, caring only for their own comfort and disregarding military discipline. They force the legionnaires to do the most menial work and subject them to humiliation at all times.</p>
<p>No Money Given Upon Discharge</p>
<p>One of them was even imprisoned for four months for disobeying the orders of a German officer. Therefore, life in the Foreign Legion was unbearable. Several people attempted to escape but failed. When they were discharged on March 13, the colonel in command of the Foreign Legion not only did not give them any severance pay but also did not express any words of gratitude. As a result, they all set off wearing uniforms without insignias and had no money to buy civilian clothes.</p>
<p>Continuous Rain and Many Suffer from Illness</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shanghai, most of them were penniless and could not even afford cigarettes, let alone lodging. More than fifty people from Shanghai and Tianjin who enlisted in the French Foreign Legion were sent to Vietnam. They had all defended the trenches for two months. They encountered continuous rain and many suffered from malaria and other illnesses and could not leave Vietnam temporarily. Therefore, these fifty people have returned to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Colonel Turner, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in North China, arrived in Shanghai on the New Peking at 7 p.m. the night before last. He disembarked at the Jardine Matheson Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Colonel Baker, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, personally welcomed him at the wharf. It is reported that Mr. Turner has been ordered to return to the U.S. and has come to Shanghai to wait for a ship. He is scheduled to return to the U.S. on the President Taft of the American President Lines on the 25th to assume a new position in Washington. After arriving in Shanghai the night before last, U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Lockhart, hosted a banquet for him at the Cathay Hotel. Many well-known figures from the U.S. expatriate community were invited to attend. At 12:30 p.m. yesterday, Colonel Baker also hosted a luncheon at the same location. It is reported that Mr. Turner is very busy with social engagements in Shanghai. At 6:30 p.m. last night, Mrs. Harkin hosted a tea party at the Metropole Apartments. At 7:30 p.m., Colonel Baker hosted another banquet at the Cercle Sportif Français. The intelligence officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, Hamilton, will host a tea party at the American Club at 5:30 p.m. tonight. The chief of staff of the Fourth Marine Regiment, Wynne, will host a banquet at the Cercle Sportif Français tonight, and U.S. Embassy Counselor to China, William, will host a banquet on the 22nd.</p>

<h3 id="e31">After "Municipal Police" Are Transferred to the Special Police, Raises Are Being Planned The Original Salaries Will Match 20% of Those of the Chinese Constables Requirements May Be Submitted Within Days <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Evening Post" reports that it has been learned that those "municipal police" who have been transferred to the special police force in the Western District are currently agitating to have their salaries brought into line with those of the Chinese constables transferred to the special police force. Since the special police force was only established at the beginning of this week, the above-mentioned problem has not reached a serious level. However, it is heard that these "municipal police" may formally submit their requests within days, because the monthly salary they receive is only 20 to 30 yuan, while the Chinese constables transferred from the Public Concession receive a regular monthly salary of 100 to 150 yuan. The reporter inquired with officials of the Public Works Department about this matter being something that they could hopefully resolve soon. According to them, the salary increase problem has no impact on the authorities of the Public Concession and will be resolved by the "Municipal Government authorities" themselves. At the same time, the special police force continues to carry out its work today, and all matters relating to police work in the Western District are handled by "Special Police Commissioner" Pan Da and "Deputy Commissioner" Ke Lisha. As for when gambling and other criminal activities in the Western District will be prohibited, neither of them expressed an opinion, only saying that they hoped they would be prohibited soon.</p>

<p>The Central Book Review Committee, in order to investigate various improper film books, magazines, etc. published in Shanghai and Hong Kong, believes that their content is obscene and not only sufficient to affect the morale of the people in the rear areas, but also consumes paper and printing, which is contrary to the wartime policy of strict economy. Therefore, it has issued a special order to the book review committees of various provinces and cities to strictly prohibit their import and distribution. Those stored in bookstores must also be completely cleared out by the end of February.</p>
<h3 id="e33">French Electric Workers' Strike Preliminary Negotiations Underway Labor Representatives Also Agree to Mediation British Tram Workers Submit Demands Yesterday <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>After the French tram workers went on strike the day before yesterday, the British bus workers followed suit, causing a sensation in society for a time. Yesterday, the political department of the French Concession police department, because the labor dispute was unresolved and had a great impact on public transportation, tried hard to persuade the labor force to resume work quickly and wait for a reasonable solution. At the same time, the company authorities originally scheduled a direct discussion with the labor representatives at the company yesterday morning, but the labor representatives did not attend at the time. Yesterday afternoon, the iron gates along the French Concession's border with the Chinese areas were closed for a time. As for the British bus workers, after formally accepting mediation and signing a labor-management agreement the night before last, all the workers resumed work that night, and a small number of vehicles were dispatched. As of yesterday morning, all vehicles were running completely as usual. Until yesterday afternoon, the British tram workers suddenly submitted 12 demands to the management, including salary increases and improved treatment. The company authorities agreed to reply, so the vehicles on all routes continued to operate as usual.</p>
<p>French Tram Workers' Attitude</p>
<p>After all the workers of the French Water and Electric Company went on strike the day before yesterday because their demands were not met, all traffic in the French Concession came to a standstill. The political department of the French police station sent personnel to contact the labor representatives yesterday, and the labor representatives also agreed to mediation. It was also reported that the two sides had held preliminary negotiations yesterday afternoon. The French side at that time advised the labor representatives to resume work immediately, and they would give careful consideration to the demands. Although the labor representatives were not satisfied, the resumption of work did not materialize, but the labor representatives' attitude was still moderate, indicating that as long as the management brought forward the deadline for reply from the 25th and held negotiations as soon as possible, they could also resume work in advance, so the resolution of the labor dispute has not fallen into pessimism.</p>
<p>Oil Tankers Resume Operation</p>
<p>The French electric workers' strike the day before yesterday included the water plant and the power plant, so the nature was particularly serious. However, because the plants usually have White Russian workers, the water and electricity supply was fortunately able to continue as usual. However, the company's large number of diesel oil tankers, which are usually driven by Chinese workers, transport 50 tons of diesel oil from the company to the Public Concession every day. Once they stop, the French Concession power plant will be unable to work, so the relationship is extremely important. The workers who drove these vehicles also participated in the strike the day before yesterday, causing the power plant to only be able to use its existing oil reserves to maintain operation. However, the labor representatives were able to understand the overall situation, so they ordered these workers to resume work first yesterday. As for the vicinity of the French Electric Company, detectives were still densely deployed yesterday, and protection was extremely strict.</p>
<p>Demands</p>
<p>The labor representatives went on strike this time because the written demands they submitted to the management several times after the 3rd of this month had not been answered. On the eve of the strike (the 18th), they submitted a fourth request to the management, the content of which was: (1) In recent times, prices have risen sharply, please generously increase various subsidies. (2) If there is a suspension of work due to roll call penalties, all subsidies and rice subsidies should be paid as usual, but this rule does not apply to employees who take leave of absence. (3) The workers who have been suspended before the announcement of the rewards and punishments should be reinstated. (4) The tram third-class or trailer and bus should add door attendants, and the operating hours of each route should also be extended to avoid danger to the public. Although the management agreed to reply to this request on the 25th, the labor representatives obviously did not want to wait, so they went on strike.</p>
<p>Bus Labor and Management Sign Agreement</p>
<p>After the workers of the British China Bus Company went on strike for a time the day before yesterday to demand rice subsidies, etc., fortunately, the Industrial Division of the Public Works Department quickly mediated and immediately signed an agreement to resolve the issue. All the workers resumed work that night. Starting yesterday, the buses on each route have completely resumed operation. The Public Concession authorities' temporary precautions for the bus workers' strike have been completely lifted since yesterday. Regarding the workers' rice subsidies for March, the company has issued 55 yuan of national currency (equivalent to five pecks of rice) to each person temporarily in accordance with the agreement and will settle the actual amount of the rice subsidy based on the retail rice price investigated by the Public Works Department, using today's market price as the standard, by March 31.</p>
<p>British Electric Workers Make Conditions Again</p>
<p>The workers of the British Tram Company also submitted 12 demands to the management the day before yesterday to improve their treatment, the main ones being: (1) Increase wages by 150 percent. (2) Increase rice subsidies by 20 cents per person per day. (3) The company should wash and iron each person's uniform. (4) Allow the establishment of a labor union and allow it to interfere in company affairs. Yesterday morning, the labor and management held a meeting. It was heard that although the results were not completely resolved, the talks were quite smooth because both sides were able to be sincere with each other.</p>
<p>Discussed Yesterday</p>
<p>The tram workers of the French Concession were still on strike yesterday (the 20th). The tram workers of the Public Concession submitted 12 demands to the company yesterday morning. The general manager of the company, Owen, held preliminary discussions with the workers' representatives on these demands yesterday morning. According to Owen, the workers did not show signs of striking, as they did not state that they would strike if their demands were not met.</p>
<p>Smooth Talks</p>
<p>Owen also said yesterday morning that the talks with the workers were progressing smoothly. He hoped to negotiate a peaceful way to amend the workers' demands so that the tram services in the Public Concession could be spared from suspension. Yesterday morning, the police and tram company personnel stated that the workers were instigated by political motives to make demands, but it is hoped that no incident will occur this time.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Limiting the Consumption of Electricity Will Also Be Implemented <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The British Shanghai Electric Construction Company has applied to the Public Works Department to consider measures to limit electricity consumption within the Public Concession in accordance with the policy of saving electricity. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department considered this application at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon. It is heard that because this matter is quite urgent, the Public Works Department will issue a public announcement soon to announce its decision. It is also heard that the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company has submitted certain suggestions to the Public Works Department regarding the control and reduction of electricity consumption. The issue of supplying electricity to new users is also under consideration by the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>New Applications Will Not Be Supplied</p>
<p>It is heard that among the several suggestions submitted by the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company to the Public Works Department for consideration, one requires the cessation of supplying electricity to new users. At the same time, the Shanghai Power Company continued to ask the public to save electricity as much as possible yesterday (the 20th) and to prepare for the restriction of electricity. The power company has asked reporters from the Chinese, English, Japanese, and Russian newspapers in the city to visit the company's Riverside Power Plant on Wednesday. It is expected that 50 journalists will visit at that time.</p>

<p>According to a statement made to the outside world yesterday by an official of the British Consulate General in Shanghai, regarding the request of the Shanghai Power Company to the U.K. to send ships to the Far East to transport coal in order to solve the fuel shortage problem, the reply from the British Shipping Department has arrived in Shanghai. It is heard that the reply said that the hope of sending a British ship to Shanghai at the moment is "extremely difficult to realize." It also stated that although the British Empire is currently in wartime, the London Shipping Department is still maintaining close cooperation with the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, the Shanghai Power Company, and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., doing its best to help solve the difficulty. Therefore, the British Consulate General's Deputy Shipping Consul is still trying to get British ships that regularly come to Shanghai or come to Shanghai for repairs to transport coal to Shanghai. There are a total of 27 ships registered in Shanghai. According to precedent, ships of this type registered in Shanghai must be docked for repairs once every nine months. The Shanghai Power Company is now relying on this somewhat uncertain supply. Furthermore, it is not yet known how many of these 27 ships will come to Shanghai for repairs in the future. The British government authorities may order these ships to be repaired in Calcutta or other ports. These ships may have been concentrated in Greece due to the British involvement there. Therefore, no matter how one studies the situation, it is extremely difficult for the British government to help with Shanghai's coal problem. The Shanghai Power Company is also deeply aware of this point.</p>

<p>Wang Yongsheng, a native of Changshu, 41 years old, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown and is temporarily staying in a hotel. At 2 p.m. yesterday, he went to a gambling den at the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road in western Shanghai alone. After a while, he won 200 yuan in national currency and happily left to return. He boarded a No. 70 tram's first-class car on Route 2 at Jing'an Temple, traveling from west to east. Unexpectedly, three bandits followed him closely, step by step. Two bandits sat to Wang's left and right in the car. When the car reached Seymour Road on Avenue Haig, one of the bandits took out a Mauser pistol and forced him to hand over the national currency. At first, Wang only gave 100 yuan. The bandits repeatedly said to be more sensible, that this wasn't enough, and hit his leg hard with the gun handle. Wang was stunned by this situation, at a loss and unable to move. He hurriedly handed over all 400 yuan of national currency in his pocket. The bandits took the loot and got off the car, transferring to a Route 24 trolleybus.

<p>Zhu Boquan (44 years old), a man of Xiaoren in the joint reserve of the Bank of China and important positions in the Kenye Bank and China Insurance Company, was leaving his home at 640 Haig Road at about 10 a.m. on November 29 last year, taking his own No. 48 black car to the Kenye Bank to work. The driver, Zhang Zhengfa, from Pudong, was suddenly intercepted by several bandits wielding pistols and Mauser pistols as he passed near Haig Road and Yidingpan Road.</p>
<p>The Car Was Intercepted</p>
<p>Threatening Zhu and shouting, they drove the chauffeur Zhang Zhengfa away and sped off in the car, kidnapping him to an empty room in the Yiji Construction Factory rented in advance by Ruo Bei at 315 Daxilu, holding him temporarily for a few hours, then transferring him to a straw room in the Houjia House on Columbia Road in western Shanghai, writing a letter and notifying his family to demand 700,000 yuan, or they would harm his life. Later, his friends and others managed to pay a ransom of 60,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the gang leader in this case, named Liu Zhenguo, after receiving the money,</p>

<p>At 12:25 p.m. yesterday, on the southern side of Xinzha Bridge on West Suzhou Road in the Public Concession, an incident occurred in which two pedestrians were shot and wounded. Zhu Jianggong (30 years old), a native of Hangxian, lived at 211 Changhai Road, Zhabei, and used to be a bodyguard for Chuan Xiaoan, so he had his own pistol. At about 9 a.m. yesterday, Zhu's friend Zhuang Zhitang (also named Zhitang, 38 years old, residing at 6 Ai Duoli, Zhengjia Muqiao, French Concession), from Jiangxi, went to visit Zhu. After chatting for a long time, the two went out together, planning to go to a certain place in the concession. At the time of the incident, when Zhu and Zhuang were walking on the south side of Xinzha Bridge, they were suddenly sniped by a man lying in ambush. He quickly fired two shots, one hitting Zhu in the back, the bullet piercing his left shoulder, and the other hitting Zhuang in the buttocks, passing through his lower abdomen. The two immediately fell to the ground at the same time, bleeding profusely. The shooter, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled without a trace. Afterwards, after the patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, they telegraphed the Xinzha Police Station and called a car to send the injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is heard that Zhuang's injuries are more serious than Zhu's. The police station is currently investigating the case in detail. One said that Zhu is currently a reporter for the Japanese Embassy.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Grain Prices: Speculators and Market Manipulators Run Rampant; Rice Prices Surge After a Brief Dip; Who Said Saigon Had No Deliveries... When Rice Arrives Daily Now? <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Early morning trading of imported rice saw little interest from speculators. Supply lines appeared endless, and settling orders were easily announced. However, Chinese and foreign merchants were actively communicating via telegram, arranging for shipments from the production areas. It's expected that the supply of imported rice will gradually increase. Besides the recent arrival of a bulk shipment of 25,000 bags, smaller quantities continued to arrive. As a result, some of the speculators and foreign traders engaged in short-term speculation began to sell off their holdings. After the market opened, selling was brisk, and the black market premium for Xiaojiao rice (a type of rice) immediately dropped by 4,000 coins per hundred bags, reaching a low of 3,700 yuan. Saigon rice fell to as low as 3,300 yuan, and broken rice to 2,600 yuan. The market seemed to be trending towards stability. Unexpectedly, after the slight price drop, "market manipulators" and short-sellers seized the opportunity to buy low to cover their positions. Moreover, large speculators, unwilling to accept their losses, started to prop up prices again, causing the market to rise steadily. Xiaojiao rice rebounded from 3,800-3,900 yuan to 4,000-4,100 yuan. Annam glutinous rice, initially offered at 3,600 yuan, found little further demand. Saigon Number One rice reached 3,600 yuan again, and Number Two rose from 3,500 yuan to 3,800 yuan. Broken rice also climbed to 3,000 yuan, recovering 300-400 yuan from the morning's low. However, it was still about 2 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Total transaction volume for the day was reported to be 14,000-15,000 bags.</p>
<p>Large quantities of imported rice continued to arrive. Two French ships arrived, directly carrying over 40,000 bags from Saigon, as previously reported. It's now known that the Eldorado, a ship managed by the Bao Long Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 10th) in the evening, also directly carrying over 18,000 bags from Saigon. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou ship, carrying 12,143 bags from Hong Kong, docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Furthermore, the company's Qiongzhou ship arrived in port yesterday evening, also carrying imported rice. The quantity is still being investigated and will be reported later.</p>
<p>Yesterday, among domestic rice varieties, Bao rice saw weakening sales and was unable to sustain its price, falling by another 1-2 yuan. Early Qingjiaojiao rice was offered at 114.5 yuan and 114 yuan per dan (unit of measurement), while original-packaged rice was priced at 120 yuan. Thick Japonica rice, due to its broader distribution and firm quality, was more resilient. Sellers remained firm, and prices were stable. Regular grain stores offered premium Japonica rice at 127.5 yuan and 126 yuan per dan, while Kunshan rice offered high-quality Japonica rice at 124-125 yuan, down to 120 yuan. Original-packaged Zhongguan rice was priced at 125-126 yuan. Xiang rice saw little activity and minimal price fluctuations. Hong Kong special grade rice opened at 110 yuan, ordinary rice at 107-108 yuan, down to 104 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Flour Market Gradually Weakening <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw imported and domestically produced flour facing challenges. Although foreign-ordered flour wasn't arriving in Shanghai as scheduled, goods being transshipped from Hong Kong were steadily on their way. The market supply was increasing daily. Amidst the news of stable and weakening rice prices, speculators lacked the excitement for speculation. Australian Flower Bird Clock Tower brand flour, with recent arrivals being abundant, saw its market unable to sustain its price, falling back to 32 yuan. Evening trading was even more sluggish, with rumors of prices falling below the 32 yuan mark. Jinlong brand flour was at 31.1 yuan, down 5-6 jiao compared to the previous day. Factory-direct cheap flour from the Fuxin Factory remained at 25 yuan, with over 50 bags supplied, supplemented by imported flour to make up for any shortfall.</p>
<p>Wheat market conditions for both domestic and imported wheat were quiet with little supply or demand. High-quality wheat was priced at 45-46 yuan. Occasional small sales were quickly absorbed by a certain party. The Hua Factory saw little activity in either sales or purchases. The market remained stagnant as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil and Corn Decline <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil and corn markets continued their downward trend. Soybean oil fell by 2.5 yuan to 1.5 yuan. Transactions included 150 dan of factory oil, 70 barrels of Hankou oil, 50 barrels of Dalian oil, and 700 barrels of forward oil. Corn futures opened with 1,500 bags for immediate delivery and 600 tons for forward delivery (detailed prices are listed in the market price section). While the adverse weather conditions haven't yet cleared, the crisis hasn't been resolved. If speculators continue to ignore the warnings, they will eventually face the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>500 tins of crude oil from Yantai were scheduled to arrive on the 30th.</p>

After the morning opening, speculators rushed to sell, causing the U.S. dollar rate for this month to briefly become difficult to sell at 5.4375 yuan. However, British firms and banks with favorable exchange rates absorbed the supply and the rate softened. The British pound rate also faced difficulty settling at 3/125 of a tael due to a certain American bank buying it up. However, a telegram from Hong Kong announced sales, and the rate quickly stabilized. Around noon, speculators slightly increased their purchases, and banks were willing to supply, leading to a stagnant and stable U.S. dollar rate. In the afternoon, trading became even quieter, with the final British pound rate at 3/125 of a tael and the U.S. dollar rate at 5.40625 yuan, unchanged from the previous day's closing price.

Also, there were rumors of a peace agreement with Japan. The bank subsequently started selling, selling U.S. dollars for March delivery to HSBC at 5.4375 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's speculative gold market was initially strong, briefly breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,420 yuan. This was due to competitive buying by two groups of securities firms in western Shanghai. Later, rumors of a peace agreement with Japan spread, and those who had speculated began to sell off. By noon, it had fallen back to the 6,400 yuan mark. The afternoon was uneventful, with a flat and weak trend. Money exchange firms like Shunyuan and Decheng resumed short selling, resulting in a final drop of 2 yuan. After the market closed, Dafeng sold off, but there were few buyers, resulting in a further small drop. Total trading volume for the day was 7,000-8,000 taels. For forward trading, sellers were willing to offer a premium of 40 yuan for the rollover from March to April, but there were no transactions. For immediate delivery, Xianghe (representing foreign firms) and Xiangxingyong (representing Chinese clients) were actively buying, accumulating a total of 800-900 taels at a price of 280 yuan. This was supplied by cash houses like Chengji, Yongfeng, and silver firms like Mingfeng.</p>
<p>Speculative Gold Only Down Two Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened stable and flat, initially reaching 6,400 yuan, 8 yuan higher than the previous day. Shortly after, Chengji and Dafeng suddenly began selling on behalf of the exchange firms, while securities firms like Defu, Xinfeng and Yong also sold, dropping the price to 6,375 yuan. Later, as the exchange market softened, Deda and Tianyuan aggressively bought low, and the western Shanghai group secretly moved, returning to the 6,400 yuan mark. Later, with the sudden pulling by securities firms like Defu, Tong Kangyong and Yida, and retail investors taking the opportunity to push up prices, although Xianghe and the exchange shorts supplied, once rose, reaching 6,420 yuan. Because the buyers' appetite turned sluggish, floating households took profits and sold off. Soon there were also Japanese peace news. Yida, Xiang and Yongheng Kee sold at a loss, dropping to 6,387 yuan. At noon, they had relied on Cheng Fei to stop the sale and buy up, and recovered to 6,410 yuan.

<p>The yarn market continues to waver, as sales to customers have not kept up with supply. Hong Kong buyers are less active than the previous day, and the foreign exchange market is quiet. As a result, sentiment has weakened. However, most hold a high price expectation because of course everyone buys a few bags, of course looking at the rising to be able to make a profit.

<p>The football match between the referee team and the reporter team, which was originally scheduled to be held last week, has been postponed due to certain reasons and changed to be held at Nie Zhongcheng Huatong Public School at 3:00 p.m. this Saturday. It is now known that the Western Association notified both sides yesterday that the competition will be temporarily cancelled this year. It is said that the reason is also due to the Yiyuan incident last week.</p>

<p>The Shankun Cup Medium-Sized Football League Tournament was originally scheduled to be unveiled last weekend, but due to the unfortunate incident in the Donghua vs. Western Police A-League football final at Yiyuan Stadium on Saturday, a notice was temporarily received from the French police station to stop the event. Last night, the association held a competition committee to discuss the results and decided to move the competition to the Public Concession. A venue has now been agreed upon at the Guangxia Middle School Stadium on Fuxu Road. However, due to the smaller size of the venue, it can only be used as a small rubber ball stadium. After the suggestion of the members, the cup will use small rubber balls, which has been approved. The league grouping is still the same as originally planned. Anyone who wants to withdraw should contact the association's office within days. In order to make the association's work easier, it is hoped that all the teams that have participated will not make a request to withdraw, so as not to reduce the interest in the competition. The tournament will begin on Saturday next week (29th).</p>

<h3 id="e68">After the Electricity Reduction <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Sima Jun</p>
<p>The factory director arrived at the office. A long, narrow envelope with an English letter was already on his desk. Fortunately, it had a Chinese translation inside.</p>
<p>The factory director frowned, rereading it repeatedly. In short, it was another electricity fee increase.</p>
<p>His mind was in turmoil, everything tightening around his thoughts, as if getting tighter and tighter. The goods had all been ordered, customers thronged the door every day, but the factory lacked 6,000 yuan of raw silk and over 3,000 yuan of rayon—practically nothing.</p>
<p>Although business was good, the supply route was cut off, racking his brains. Adding the electricity reduction made him restless.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette, slumped on the sofa, and thought: "Originally, we used 20,000 units of electricity each month. After the reduction, it will be reduced to 70%, so we can only use 14,000 units. But what about the 6,000 units? Three times, three times!"</p>
<p>He seemed in great pain, taking a deep breath. "In short, expenses will increase again!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, he jumped up from the sofa and pressed the buzzer to the factory, pacing anxiously.</p>
<p>When the workshop supervisor walked into the office, the factory director politely wiped the sofa chair, "Please sit, sit!" He himself plopped down on the sofa and said to the workshop supervisor in a negotiating tone:</p>
<p>"The electricity reduction has been implemented. Our factory will use at least 6,000 units less per month. I was thinking, we can turn off more lights during the day. But the motors, I want to replace all the small motors with large ones. What do you think?"</p>
<p>The workshop supervisor did not expect such a sudden question. Thinking about the difficulties of converting to large motors in the factory, he replied:</p>
<p>"That won't work. Converting to large motors is dangerous, and the buildings and space aren't suitable. If we convert, the installation costs will be very high!"</p>
<p>The factory director felt like he had been splashed with a bucket of cold water, but, "We can save on electricity fees by converting to large motors!"</p>
<p>"Saving is certainly good, but all the prerequisites aren't there."</p>
<p>The factory director still didn't believe it. He picked up the phone and called the electrical consultant to come quickly.</p>
<p>After the electrical consultant arrived, the factory director accompanied him on an inspection of the factory. Back in the office, he asked, "How much would it cost to convert?"</p>
<p>"At least 30,000 yuan!"</p>
<p>The factory director clicked his tongue and shook his head. "That's terrible, so expensive!"</p>
<p>The electrical consultant said, "It's not expensive. It might go up in a few days!"</p>
<p>The factory director always felt that this huge expense wasn't worth it. Should he give up? But what about the unexpected triple cost of 6,000 units? Save, save, but there's no way to save 6,000 units!</p>
<p>That whole night, he didn't sleep. All kinds of "solutions" swirled in his brain, finally rolling out one. The next morning, he rushed to the office early, first rereading the electricity reduction letter. He called over the accountant: "Go draft a notice stating that due to the electricity reduction, the factory has no choice but to increase the price of all goods threefold, starting from the 20th of this month!"</p>
<p>"Didn't we just raise prices?" the accountant asked.</p>
<p>"Look, aren't the electricity fees tripling!"</p>
<p>In the afternoon, he urged the printing house to bring the printed materials. The accountant buried himself in checking addresses, customers, and writing envelopes. The factory director also stood by, urging the deliveryman:</p>
<p>"The letters must be delivered tonight. All new prices tomorrow!"</p>
<h3 id="e69">Thoughts After Reading Mr. Yu's "Announcement" <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Weide</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing has gone to Hong Kong. Before leaving, he published a large announcement, detailing the sources and destinations of rice purchases and the profits and losses in a "list." Although the dates only go up to January 19th of this year, and the sales items include the names of "Shen Ji" and "Zhao Qingji," which still inevitably raise suspicions, the fact that he "was able to purchase as many as 200,000 dan of rice in a short period of time" is indeed "a drop in the bucket for Shanghai's food problem." Moreover, he had "advanced more than 10 million yuan beforehand" and "donated 349,884 yuan, 9 jiao, and 5 fen to the Sanbei Price Equalization Association's losses, and also donated 100,000 yuan to the Ningbo Price Equalization Association." He even "transferred" the net profit of 200,434 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen and "made up the shortfall!" Mr. Yu himself said that "sincerity has not been fully believed, resulting in damage in the pursuit of perfection," which really makes those who "do not understand the truth" "increase their shame!"</p>
<p>This "incident" is now, of course, a thing of the past. Mr. Yu's merits and demerits can also be clearly distinguished. However, the hidden worries about people's food have not been resolved by Mr. Yu's departure. On the contrary, they have become more serious, just as Mr. Yu said in his farewell message, "Continued supply still depends on everyone's support." However, even someone like Mr. Yu, who sought welfare for the city's four million people, still "suffered rumors." Then, how can those who are truly "not fully believed" bear this heavy burden?</p>
<p>However, it must also be said that in these difficult and challenging years, it is not the time to seek merits and demerits. As long as what is done is "reflecting on oneself and following the rules," and it is indeed for the welfare of society and the country, one can ignore slander and defamation and strive to do one's best. We hope that those who come later can emerge and take on this important task under this most commercial principle, so that Mr. Yu, who has left his "second hometown," can rest assured, and the common people will be fortunate!</p>
<h3 id="e70">Begonia <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Lust</p>
<p>The letters and gifts were all sent out smoothly the next morning. At the same time, according to Zhao Si's report, the 100 yuan he promised to give to Ji Zhaoxiong was also brought to him. The recipient seemed very happy.</p>
<p>But one thing worried Begonia a lot, and that was Zhao Yukun's disappearance. According to the police station, he had been released yesterday afternoon, but Yukun had not returned to the Tianjin Hotel until the afternoon of the next day. Rong Kui and Begonia's pianist, Jin Dagezi, went out to look for him all night, going through all the small hotels nearby, but they couldn't find him.</p>
<p>"Could he have been done in by those hooligans?" Zhao Si asked, raising his fat face, revealing a strangely nervous look.</p>
<p>At that time, they were all in Ma Jinshou's room. This young man who sang male roles, who was actually less than 30 years old, looked as if he was an old man of sixty or seventy, because most of his time was spent on the opium couch. Because his title was a Tan School male singer, he had to be weird and perfect on stage. Smoking opium was a necessary condition!</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that! As long as they don't use weapons, one or two dozen hooligans aren't enough for the second boss to deal with!" Jin Dagezi leaned against the door frame, scratching his bald head with his right hand non-stop.</p>
<p>"A poisonous dragon can't fight a local snake. Don't underestimate them too much!" Zhao Si disagreed.</p>
<p>Begonia sat silently on Ma Jinshou's opium couch, not expressing any opinion. He knew that Zhao Yukun was not only physically strong and slippery, but also very quick-witted. Logically, he shouldn't have stumbled in front of those rascals. And in fact, it was indeed impossible to find him for the time being. It seemed that he could only wait until he returned to Beijing to talk about it. (60)</p>

<p>— Juehui</p>
<p>In adverse circumstances, in inferior circumstances, truly wise people must have three conditions:</p>
<p>First, recognize the situation; second, understand the people's livelihood; third, understand the responsibility. Anyone who violates one of these three, regardless of whether they are high officials, well-known philanthropists, or important figures from all walks of life, must all be regarded as "enemies of the people"!</p>
<p>But recognizing the situation does not mean pretending to be a "hero"; understanding the people's livelihood does not mean habitually being perfunctory; and understanding responsibility does not mean using it as an excuse to shirk responsibility. Because we have already reached the point where "the map is unrolled and the dagger is revealed." Who is right and who is wrong, who is good and who is bad, who is complacent and who compromises, is clearer than a mirror a thousand times over!</p>
<p>Going back to the point, "the past is gone, the future can be pursued." It's "not too late" to pull back the runaway "wild horse" halfway. Otherwise, when a person is extremely hungry, they can do anything! (This is not a "threat," pay attention.)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Making a Move <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hufu</p>
<p>"A true gentleman does not speak when watching chess, and a great man never regrets a move." This is said to be the "personality" of a "gentleman" playing chess.</p>
<p>However, nowadays, the world is deteriorating, and the chess pieces for playing chess have been changed to the latest "substitutes"—called "whole bags of white rice"!</p>
<p>Therefore, white rice, which is of utmost importance to the people, has now been devalued and even used as a "toy" by a few people, manipulated on the chessboard.</p>
<p>Of course, moving bags of rice on the chessboard is a "laborious" game, but "gentlemen" can use "cranes" to do the work, and they only need to stand by and plan! Fortunately, "victory or defeat is common in war," and it has nothing to do with them!</p>
<p>Moreover, I heard that "immortals play chess endlessly." The friends watching the chess next to them, one by one, ran out of saliva and fell down, but the "immortals" laughed loudly and became more and more energetic! Fortunately, no one dares to break into the "White Tiger Hall" in the "Lingxiao Palace"!</p>
<p>So they simply grabbed the chess (rice) with one hand and held a knife in the other, strictly enforcing their "gentlemen's agreement"—"A true gentleman does not speak when watching chess," you bystanders don't speak anymore; otherwise, it will be "a great man never regrets a move," and the steel knife will fall with a snap, telling you to be sensible!</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e75">"A Hundred Flowers in Bloom" <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>Lucille Ball had great success in "Flying Down to Rio," so this film "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom," starring her, caught my attention. The original name of "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom" is Too Many Girls, which, like the Chinese translation, is quite business-minded. However, "too many women" doesn't seem to fit the plot. Although there are quite a few women in this film, one might even say that one man has ten women, Lucille Ball, as the protagonist of this film, has four men pursuing her at the same time.</p>
<p>It turns out that Lucille Ball is the daughter of a wealthy man, and she will inherit her father's huge assets. So her father hired four strong men to be her bodyguards, and as a result, she fell in love with one of them, Lee Carisson. This story is truly bizarre. I don't think even in the United States, where social circumstances are different from ours, such a thing would actually happen.</p>
<p>But aside from this far-fetched story, if "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom" has any "advantages," it is that it is lively, humorous, has songs, dances, and the irrepressible enthusiasm of young male and female students. However, as for the university that serves as the background of this film, if there hadn't been that football game, I would almost have suspected it was a "dance hall."</p>
<p>Speaking of song and dance, the director of this film undoubtedly put in his best effort. Several large scenes are handled very vigorously. The Rumba dance performed by Ann Miller and Desi Arnaz is beautiful and energetic, and it is the most "outstanding" part of this film. The large chorus of dozens of people is enthusiastic, unrestrained, majestic, and sonorous, and it is indeed moving. The protagonist Lucille Ball is consistently enchanting and charming. Although she doesn't have many scenes, she plays them quite humorously, especially the several stages in which she and the male protagonist, Lee Carisson, go from suspicion to love and from love to secret love, are depicted very delicately.</p>
<p>Although this film is a "giant structure" made by RKO Pictures, bringing together a large number of song and dance performers, in terms of interest, it seems to be inferior to the company's "Nana." This shows how necessary the script is for the form of the performance.</p>

<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>The greatest enemy in life is boredom. Extraordinary talent is stolen by boredom, precious vitality is destroyed by boredom, full spirit is consumed by boredom, endless hope is killed by boredom, and physical health is destroyed by boredom. Boredom is truly the enemy of struggle—</p>

<p>Chapter 3 He Recalled Pingyuan's Appeal</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu said, "As long as it's not something with poison, I have good wound medicine in my luggage. I'll go back and apply some to Brother Xu later, and he'll recover soon." Li Xin looked at Zhang Cangqiu's heroic and bold appearance and found him very likable. He wanted Xu Jing and Zhang Cangqiu to come to his manor for a gathering immediately. Xu Jing, because there was no one at home, and the matter had come to an end, was eager to go back, so he promised Li Xin that he would invite Zhang Cangqiu to Li's Manor to visit him tomorrow. Li Xin then repeatedly urged Xu Jing not to break the appointment. Zhang Cangqiu also readily agreed, "I will definitely come to visit Lord Li tomorrow. We'll meet again." He then helped Xu Jing up with one hand, nodded to Li and Chen, and left. Li Xin also said, "Excuse me for not seeing you off. See you tomorrow." He returned with Chen Fei and the others. Zhang Cangqiu accompanied Xu Jing back to Xu's house. Xu Jing sat down in his room, and Zhang Cangqiu went to take out the wound medicine to apply to the affected area and re-bandaged it. Because it was almost five o'clock, they didn't talk much and went to sleep. The next day, everyone got up, and Zhang Cangqiu asked Xu Jing how his injury was. Xu Jing replied, "The pain stopped after applying the medicine, and it will heal soon." Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "Last night, although that Chen person made a wasted trip, he caused you to be injured for no reason. I'm really sorry." Xu Jing said, "It was my own carelessness that led to being ambushed, which has nothing to do with the strong man. The ancients said, 'Hiding wealth encourages theft.' Although we don't have gold, silver, or jewels, we have these knives, swords, and horses, which were seen by discerning people, so this happened. It's really unexpected." Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "Who exactly is that Li Xin? How do his retainers have people like chicken thieves? Xu Jing replied, "Li Xin is a martial arts graduate here. He likes to travel and has some knowledge of martial arts, like me. But he is independent and likes to socialize. Most people in the county know him. He and I are also friends, and we often go to his manor to play chess and chat. He has many followers, both civil and military. The Chen person who came last night also has very good martial arts. If Zhang Zhuangshi's skills were not superior to his, he would not have been so easily defeated. This shows that you are a hero, no wonder Li Xin wanted to invite you to his manor as soon as he met you." (17)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Interesting Anecdotes from the Shanghai Charity Performance <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Xuanmeng</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Society has a short history, it is always eager to help public welfare. Recently, it hired Mr. Yuan Ludeng as the president, and the society's affairs have made even more progress. The 16th of this month was the society's fourth charity rehearsal. All proceeds from the tickets will be used to relieve the rice famine in Ningbo. I was invited by the society to join the event. The program that day was very exciting. What I describe here are just one or two interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p>Old Uncle Praises Young Brother The young brother, Ye Gengliang, is the son of Society Director Ye Xianggao. That night, he performed "Phoenix Mountain". Mr. Yuan Ludeng was having dinner in the library on the third floor at the time. When he heard that the young brother was on stage, he ordered to move the table to the box, personally carrying his cup and chopsticks, and watched while drinking. Whenever the young brother finished shaking the clapperboard and singing or made a spear flourish, he gave him enthusiastic applause. So, everyone present said that the old uncle was praising the young brother greatly.</p>
<p>Huang Tianba Has Both Male and Female Roles On that day, two performances of Huang Tianba's play were performed. The daytime performance of "Falling Horse Lake" was performed by Mr. He; the evening performance of "Wrestling Ring Set" was performed by Miss Yu Ying. One male and one female. Isn't this having both male and female roles?</p>
<p>Yu Bei Pavilion Brothers Playing Instruments "Yu Bei Pavilion" is Mr. Li Shisun's masterpiece. His appearance is very beautiful, resembling Wan Hua in his early years. As for the singing and acting style, everything is excellent. The person playing the qin for Mr. Li is Xiao Dongyang, who used to follow Huang Yulin. The person playing the qin for Sun Junqing, the famous amateur singer, is Wang Ronggui. Xiao Dongyang and Wang Ronggui are blood brothers. Brothers playing instruments on stage, each showing their skills, is also a coincidence.</p>
