<p>平抑物價重要措置</p>
<p>工部局與公董局之物價統制處切言麴價减低、但數百萬市民受益匪淺、上海區每月用以製麵之麵粉、常時約需七萬袋、可見麵在民食中所佔重要地位之一斑、市政當局有鑒於此、乃先致力於麵粉堆棧之啟封、巳得日當局之合作而實現、次將麵價抑低每斤約六角之巨、</p>

<p>— 章格</p>
<p>耶誕夕街頭</p>
<p>從靜安寺乘電車東行，乘客不及西行車的三分之一，車中雖不擁擠，但從每人默然寡歡的面容上推想，內心　乎都感煩悶，一些找不出今夕是聖誕前夕的氣息。卡德路以西電車所經之處，也全無聖誕的點綴。往年此日麥令斯俱樂部的廣塲上的聖誕樹，銀帶繚繞，嵌着五色小電燈，輝煌照耀，門窗間都掛上彩帶製成的圓環，醉醺醺的水兵踱進踱出；距離不遠的斜橋總會，也有顆極大的圓椎形聖誕樹，纍纍的彩色电炬，像乐樂中的　实一般满　着，不時有美国的紳士一反向來的嚴肅態度，去赴化裝舞會。</p>
<p>這兩處今年都是靜悄悄的麥令斯俱樂部的新立猶太總會前的耶誕樹成了僅有的點綴。自仙樂舞宮以東，就比較熱鬧，舞榭酒吧，逢此令節，原都有一番佈置，吸引賓客。近新世界，因爲是舞塲的集中地，聖誕夕的色彩方始濃厚起來，路上不時有靑年紳士摟着服飾鮮艷的妖嬈姑娘走過，無疑這是一對對預備在今夕及時行樂的。四大百貨公司的櫥窗雖有着聖誕佳節的應窗飾，但不及以往火樹銀花，五色繽紛般美觀之什一，站着窗中的聖誕老人，白鬚紅衣，模樣如昔，但笑容顯得極不自然，恣態也有些委頓。路上沒有了有女同車，風馳電掣般駛過的汽車，偶然有幾個持有花紙包紮的聖誕禮品的行人，他們的神姿似乎平添了不少光彩，足以使其他行人相顧失色。</p>
<p>耶誕夕舞塲</p>
<p>聖誕夕的舞塲，營業為一年之冠，所以各家都鉤心　角，競以新奇花樣炫耀來賓。第一流舞塲，聖誕夕的門票十元十一元不等，所謂聖誕大菜每客竟高至四十元五十元，不售門票的各級舞塲，則　高茶資來挹注，一杯淸茶的代價，魚顛一張是平淡無奇。八時前的大華茶舞，擁擠不堪，舞客中一部份是「老白相」，他們以爲一樣玩，何必定須通脊，茶舞代價廉，晚飯時回去與家人歡聚，眞是內外咸宜；一部份則來向熟舞女報到，表示晚舞時不放「黃牛」：又一部份則是擺拆字攤者，唐喬司的音樂晚舞時去聆，就須門票十二元，現在可以分文不化，而且都是得天獨厚的嗓子，甜而有韻，聽聽大是值得。八時後巡行中區各舞　，賣座約七八成，紙　戴在頭上的僅見到三五個，大概化妝跳舞在這年頭已提不起少爺紳士們的興趣。從前中上舞廳在今日都滿　汽球，預備在十二時正奏聖誕歌時放下，讓狂歡的男女去一陣亂搶亂奪，這是絕妙噱頭，但今年却不見有此設置，大概橡皮　的汽球給鬧着玩，嫌成本太貴吧。紅舞女的裝束巳煥然一新，以白色和粉紅色居多，加上濃脂艷粉，活像新嫁娘聚會，有的舞女則依舊故我，悄坐一旁，她們似對聖誕夕未寄若何厚望。起舞者甚稀，樂師的服飾也大不如往年的燦爛，這種種，一半是事實，一半或計是心理作用。聽見很多人說今年的聖誕夕是有舞塲以來最悽慘的一夕，我也有此感覺，要是沒有這些僅有的少爺紳士們去湊熱鬧　景，簡直像一個普通星期一晚上的冷清清模樣。</p>
<p>本來各舞塲是預備在聖誕夕通宵營業的，但两租界當局的臨時措置，不得不奉命在子夜二時　打烊，這對於貧玩的人，無異澆下了一盆冷水，通宵達旦是不可能了，與猶　盡的就偕俊侶到西區舞傷去，時艱阻止不了他們，於是悽慘的聖誕夕，就是這樣地過去了。</p>

<h3 id="c63">今年的聖誕節 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 之華</p>
<p>天氣又悶又潮又暖，簡直不像是個冬天。要不是日曆是親手一頁一頁撕去的，準會以爲年復一度的耶穌誕辰的來臨是一種錯覺。</p>
<p>聖誕在近年來的上海是個狂歡的節日，生活在夜夜元宵中的上海人士，巴望的是個藉口可以縱情聲色一下，來點綴點綴。這個宗敎節日之同時亦成爲非基督徒的狂歡節，遂成了理所當然。</p>
<p>然而今年的聖誕節，却是今非昔比了。南京路，靜安寺路，霞飛路上的窗飾，就遠非往日景象，聖誕老人像零落可數，一片無垠的雪景，就祇在玻璃窗一黏上幾點棉絮，聊以應景，而這些，也許更是一個月之前就佈置好了的</p>
<p>聖誕大菜每客四十元的廣告是在報上登出來了，在往時，引起的第一個感想一定該是「朱門酒肉臭」，然而現在，却使人懷疑到有此雅興的究竟還有幾人？</p>
<p>晚上，「今晚通宵」的舞傷廣告也許依然高掛吧？可是車馬喧騰的景象呢？某舞塲的廣告上已經在請舞客「安步當車」，就近尋樂了。</p>
<p>然則今年聖誕老人的雪橇呢？他也許也祇能「安步當車」而來，而他所背負的，也祇能僅僅是袋的煤球白米。——希望他背負這兩種日用品來吧，免得放在孩子們床隅的白布袋，第二天再到米店前去「排隊」了。</p>
<h3 id="c64">耶穌樹市塲 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>在耶誕之前，照例各種應時的物品，又先後的出現於市街上面。最顯著的司以說是耶誕樹吧？往年，就我們所知道的耶誕樹，集中的地方是靜安寺和霞飛路。因爲在耶誕時節，外僑家中，都要植一株耶誕樹，而一般出售耶誕禮品的商店，也每在櫥窗中置一耶誕樹，作爲引致顧客的廣告，所以耶誕樹的銷路也相當好。</p>
<p>今回的取誕，若干商店雖然依舊有耶誕的點綴，但一般的說來，遠沒有往年的熱鬧。這是任何人司以看得出來的。主要的原因，當然是爲的外僑人數巳見减少，耶誕樹市塲不免也同樣見到萧條。前天筆者到霞飛路上去巡打一次，往常金神父路的轉角，是耶誕樹集中的地方，今年可失踪了，祇少數鮮花店門口，放着幾株。商店的櫥窗之中，耶誕樹也絕無然有而起到。靜安寺前面，耶</p>
<p>然而走到靜安寺前面，耶誕樹市傷照例在耶誕之前出現，所謂耶誕樹，非松即柏，因爲在寒冬時節，祇有松柏還是不凋而呈現綠色。有的運根掘起，有的祇是打大樹上鋸下的枚枝，下面用四根木撑，拄在地上，沿着馬路陳外着。否則這耶誕樹市塲正和浴佛節的攤販相妨，要擺到赫德路，哈同路等處，這一回，就在靜安寺的前面，數量方面，比去年少得多。</p>
<p>這些耶誕樹，都由上海四郊的花樹行運來。近年跟着百物的昂貴，耶誕樹也漲價了，高大些非幾十元一株不可。每一種花樹行，派工人四五名，坐在水門泥的石階上，應酬顧客。不然的話，這幾天正是耶誕樹暢銷的日子，可是今年情形不同，看樹的工人，大家坐着談天，難得有人上來選購，生意淸淡不少。</p>
<p>有幾家花樹行，除了耶誕樹，更端來了好多象牙紅，梅花和其他鮮花盆景。因爲西洋人到了耶誕，屋子裹要經過一番佈置，而盆景花卉，好像是必不可少的點綴。今年的耶誕，靜安寺前依舊有鮮花盆景陳行着，但看的多，買的少了。</p>
<h3 id="c65">煞風景 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 土土</p>
<p>雖則適逢時艱，但聖誕還是聖誕，各舞傷爲生意眼起見，照樣來一下慶祝，在報端宣佈聖誕夕通宵達旦營業，歡迎舞賓來參與狂歡。萬不料二租界當局突然布告週知，一應公共娛樂傷所於昨今兩天以及除夕元旦營業時間至要晨二時爲止，不准延至四時，這麼一來，通宵達旦是辦不到了，就連原來天天通宵的處所也遭了池魚之殃，而不得不提早打烊，這眞是煞風景的事，使本來已覺滿目凄凉的聖誕節更加黯然夫色！</p>
<p>五十元一客的聖誕大菜，每人十二元的門票，照物價上漲的比例來算，事實上不能說是太貴，何況上海人湊熱門的精神很好，還不是家家滿坑滿谷。平時急於籌措衣食，沒有資格尋歡作樂的。樂得沒事閉門家裹坐，聽聽空氣中的「駱駝之鈴」，終軍度過了聖誕夕。若昨天有人手頭旣拮据，心却癢癢地，傾囊去應個景，報效一番，結果歡笑之樂，過眼即逝，而生活之鞭策又緊隨於後，如再在子夜歸途中遇着什麼小亂子，那才更煞風景呢。</p>
<p>在煞風風景的情形下，紅衣白鬚的聖誕老人將不能如往年般被人看作幸福的天使，而將氣憤得白鬚倒　了。</p>

<p>十五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！</p>
<p>「現在，你再唱一段，我一定加倍給錢！」小胖子指着梅寶說。</p>
<p>「快坐到這裹來，檯上空得很咧！」那個被叫做小李的人用着模糊小淸的酒音說，一面便去拉開自己身旁的椅子。</p>
<p>姓韓的知道情形不大好，便忙着搶前一步，向他們笑了一笑，用很勉强的上海話說：：</p>
<p>「二位先生，愛聽什麼戲？」他把一本戲摺子遞到了桌子上去</p>
<p>「不，Charlie，我出二十塊錢，帶她回棧房裹去慢慢的唱吧……！」那小李歪斜着脚步，從座位上走出來，右手仲在衣袋裏，裝出摸錢的模樣。」</p>
<p>梅資來不及的往後退了雨步，同時堆着極莊重的神氣說：：</p>
<p>「對不起，我們祇會唱戲，不能跟着客人上棧房去。」</p>
<p>姓韓的性格很　巧，知道再耽擱下去事情一定要鬧僵，便立刻向梅寶和他自己的女兒丟了一個眼色，急急扶起秋海棠，大家準備給這兩倘酒鬼一走了事。</p>
<p>「別裝什麼腔啦！咱們有的是錢，二十塊錢不成，三十塊總沒有問題了吧？」小胖子提高着嗓子喊。</p>
<p>秋海棠的臉色已氣得鐵靑了。</p>
<p>「慢些，……四十塊，……別走！……四十塊……！」醉的稈度比小胖子更深幾分的小李，竟踉蹌着脚步追了上來。</p>
<p>「放屁！你們把我女兒當做什麼人看待？」秋海棠委實不能再忍耐了，突然回過身去，聲色俱厲的怒喝着。</p>
<p>小李已經走得距離他們不到兩三步了。</p>
<p>「爸爸，咱們回去吧！別跟喝醉醉了的人計較！」梅寶深恐她父親會吃虧，忙用力拉着他的胳膊，勸他快走；那韓家的姑娘也在旁邊幫着婉勸。</p>
<p>「……別走！……我出……五……五十塊……，」那叫小李的人實在己經喝得很醉，竟沒有聽見秋海棠的話。（二八九）</p>

<p>— 小天</p>
<p>聖誕節，聖誕老人永遠背負了一袋玩具，紙帽，爵士樂，香檳……分送給高等的人們！</p>
<p>人們歡迎着聖誕老人到來，是爲了他的慈祥；也許是爲了他縱容我們犯罪，抽烟，呷酒，狂舞，通宵……，一切犯罪的戒條，在聖誕節都開脫了。不過，他所眷愛的只是上帝的驕子，不是社會的棄兒。</p>
<p>運字都不識的窮小子，他們不知—不能去看爲點綴聖誕而開放的電影，去領取作爲聖誕老人賜予的禮物。他們只是哆嗦在淡淸的街角里，悵望着人家從烟囱里冒出來的一縷縷的炊烟。等特着那慈祥的聖誕老人何時從天上降臨到烟囱里，讓他們乞求一點果腹的東西。</p>
<p>聖誕老人在那里呢？</p>
<p>聖誕老人在巧格力舖子的玻璃櫥里，在花店里，在汽車後吊着，在舞塲的樂臺上……！</p>
<p>現在，聖誕老人在上海的天空盤旋觀察一下，溜走了。</p>
<p>麵粉不許做聖誕老人，私人汽車禁止行駛，跳舞塲令節不准通宵……</p>
<p>我們往全世界去尋，聖誕老人在那里呢？</p>

<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>冬夜者，外國冬至之前一夜也。事前旣無友人邀吃五十元一客之冬至大菜，臨時又無法上　　「高尚樂府玩通宵—實則事實上巳變爲半通宵—於是蜷居斗室，抽烟飲茶，踱方步以自遣，率成漫筆數則，誌之以紀念一九四一年之「茂萊克里麥司」也。</p>
<p>雖不採購聖誕禮物而姑往觀之，此亦度佳節，遣良辰之一法。漫步至前日購貿家庭麺包之某鉅肆，入門見顧客擁擠情形逈非昔比，西男西婦，及時髦之靑年郎，未老女，此來彼去，神情未見緊張。手中所携之禮物包紙，亦並弗作纍纍，欲墜狀，乃知市面欠佳，影響及於此時之各人手頭矣。</p>
<p>市上水菓早成珍品，普通薪水階級者，巳有一年難得數回嘗之嘆。花籃水菓，裝花旗香蕉味蘋果，或加洲「日吻牌橘子者，筐非不大，而菓尤碩巨，如小亭子問中擠滿十餘軀體痴肥之婦女，一人牽動，則大局不寗矣。其標價每籃六十餘元，八十餘元至一百零五元……不等。如再益以三星斧頭牌白蘭地兩瓶，則一千元祇可辦禮物兩份，猶非闊綽斗。</p>
<p>工部　規定餅干點心每逢星期日及例假日出售，目下各食物肆之餅干玻櫃，均「一貧如洗」，片餅無着。今日恭逢聖誕，循例休假之外，又可購買餅干。自十二月廿五日至一月五日，此十日中，每人得有購買餅干三次——計共三磅——之機會。照銷售牌子頂廣的餅干價格計算，每磅約爲三元八角至四元，購餅干三磅即須洋十二元。米賤之時即爲白粳一擔之數？六口之家一月糧食，綽乎有餘矣，餅干雖小道，「豈可忽視哉」！</p>
<p>英文大美晚報以切　核减售價之大號標縣，刊諸封面第一條新聞。略謂切麺售價，約爲每斤一元四角至一元五角，茲經工部局物價管委會核定爲每斤九角五分。此爲聖誕之夜的好消息，較諸滿版影戲廣告，或紅舞星「候敎　通啟之富於「誘惑」性，奚營百倍。但是上海儘多「不問切　價，但求舞塲訊」的先生們，此新聞雖刊於最　著之地位，或亦未必為此一階級之人注意耳。</p>
<p>俗傳冬至前夕聖誕老人，從烟囱中下降，以玩物實諸小兒　中而去。翌晨，　孩笑逐顏開，以為此聖尼古拉斯真能由北極駕鹿車而來也。考諸西籍，此傳說之起，實因新年將屆，居戶都通掃烟囱，以為迎接新歲佳運之預備。　來滬上煤貴如金，燃煤之家百不得一二，至於煤球爐收根本不用烟囱，在理家家佳運之來，宜略無阻滯，固不必再乞　於通掃工作矣。謹以此奉祝讀者諸君，凡家有煤球爐者，明年必能更鴻運高照也！</p>

<p>自五大頭輪影院，變更映片時間後，在過去幾天中，已證實海上一般影迷，對於此新制度，已見習慣。尤其是夜塲，自八時起，到十時為止，多數影迷，以為很適於今日的上海。這樣可使他們早些回到家裏安睡，就是為了車輛少，搭不到，路近的也可步行回腐。要是有興的話，還可到電影院附近的咖啡館或夜總會裹去消磨兩小時。</p>
<p>今天耶誕雖然受了戰事影響，存片無多，但五大影院在耶誕以至新年，照例選映新片。而據各影院所發表的消息，公映的新片陣容如下：</p>
<p>美琪將公映「海角焚舟記」，是米高梅的出品，由佛蘭支通，卡洛兒白，羅絲和約翰卡洛兒等諸大明星合演。</p>
<p>大光明映「羣英會」，由勞勃史丹，安羅絲馥，利却迭克斯等大明星合演，可算是一張陣容整齊的名片。</p>

<p>國泰映太虛道人」，由勞勃蒙高茂萊，克勞黛蕾絲等主演，是本季的一部鉅片。</p>
<p>大華映「百貨店」，也是米高梅的出品，由馬克斯三弟兄及湯姆馬丁合演，是一部喜劇片這幾部新片，都巳在耶誕的前夕和海上影迷相見，而且內容都很精彩，為好萊塢本年度水準以上的出品。</p>

<p>邇來黃金變更開演時問，戲碼之硬，得未曾有！日前往作座上客，頗極視聽之娛，記之如次：</p>
<p>首上翠屛山，高盛麟之石秀，白口淸晰有勁，酷似小樓，唱則力不從心，敷衍了事，高本有嗓，奈何致此？吵家之神情，殺由之刀法尚可。劉斌崑之海和尙，耍佛珠自是一絕，芙蓉草之巧雲，苗勝春之楊雄，一則兇悍潑辣，一則關葺萎瑣，均能恰如其分，接演巧連環，艾世菊飾時遷，手脚輕捷，道白乾脆，不輸葉盛章，矮步尤見幼工，戲耍店家及偷雞吃火，妙在隨處流露賊腔，令人絕倒。次為販馬記，振飛之趙寵，無論身上。嘴裏，與夫舉手投足，莫不妙到秋毫，余觀之者屢，當世當不作第二人想，桂枝一角，非梅程之雍容華貴，不足匹敵，侯玉蘭雖尙能演戲，究以年穉，火候未到，相形之下，遂益見振飛之精湛洗鍊矣，王少亭之李奇，得工穩二字。又次為羣英會，程繼仙之周瑜，除唱工較遜外，耍翎眼神及幾次佯笑，均臻上乘，前輩典型，畢竟不凡！奚嘯伯前魯肅，後孔明，賣力非常，獨惜嗓音奇狹，韻味雖佳，聲如發自甕中，令人聽不痛快，藏書一塲，當蔣幹扶醉入室時，魯肅以袖掩燈，疾步而出，信芳演此，有一絕妙急走身段，帽翎微顫，掩燈之水袖抖動，面現驚惶之色，且行目顧，煞是好看，嘯伯則無之，僅略揮髯口而已，借箭一塲，演來不瘟不火，最為精采，王少亭之孔明，亦工力悉敵，借風之二簧，純宗連良，斯時台下和者四起，歌聲遂為所掩。茹富蕙之蔣幹，狀子翼之糊塗，顢預中不脫書生氣，迪非馬富祿之一味傖俗可比，王泉奎之黃蓋，袁世海之曹操，堪云雙絕，王之碩大聲洪，環顧劇壇，不易多覯，袁之嗓闊而沉着，兼具郝之「狠」曰，最合演曹操戲，當蔣幹盜書回營，曹中計誤殺蔡瑁後，蔣幹猶欲討功，袁唱「你本是書獃子一盆麵漿」之搖板，面部一種愧悔神氣，活畫當時阿瞞心理。袁世海藝愈精進，風頭奇健，出台時且亮大電燈，與主角一例待遇，可謂捧足輸贏。小三麻子接演華容道，平平而已。大軸二進宮，奚侯王各買餘勇，一絲不苟，　上精神，有足多者，三人中自以侯之工力較弱，對口時微現慌張，奚王則歌來酣暢淋漓，始終不懈，劇終已屆九時，自二時開　，計演足七小時之多，誠創菊園新紀錄矣。</p>
<h3 id="c72">關於「梅花夢」 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 何言</p>
<p>彭玉麟與梅仙的故事，知道的人也許很少。大家所知道的，僅是彭玉麟統領水軍打過太平天國，其他就無所知了，「梅花夢」一劇，乃是把彭玉鱗介紹給大家，他是怎樣的一個人物，並且吿訴大家，他的性格思想受到了怎樣的影響。</p>
<p>彭玉麟雖是淸季攻太平軍的名將，然而他却是一個思想革命者，在淸朝的壓制下，彭玉麟本來是個「忠」臣，為了他底愛人相仙的正義激勸說服，於是他覺悟了，這裹而的情節當然不是很簡單的，由梅仙而岳二官，彭玉麟在精神上也得到許多教訓。</p>
<p>本劇原作者譯正璧是研究個新頴的題材，實在是不可多得的，本劇又由名導演費穆改編導演更是錦上添花，生動緊一湊，自不必說，而處理方法，一比讀一本彭玉麟傳，或是硏究彭玉麟的思想行動，那可勝過千百倍。</p>
<p>據報載「梅花夢」即將在璇宮劇院演出，作者探得一些消息：據云上演期在三十一年元旦左右，劇情分作七幕。眞是洋洋大觀，所有佈景，服裝，道具，皆華貴異常，總計此劇耗費二萬元之譜。至於演員，仍係演「淸宮怨」「孤島男女諸劇名角，演技相當精湛。</p>
<p>吾人甚期望此劇能早日上演，得在此荒凉之劇壇上放一異彩，並一飽觀衆的眼福。</p>

<p>漢時有都盧尋撞之戲，實即後世所謂上竿，亦稱長竿，緣竿，扒竿等等。都盧為西域國名，在今甘肅省境，其人體輕善緣，故能壇演此戲。此種戲法，據漢張衡西京賦所載，乃是下設劇車，車上植一畏竿。（按尋樓即長竿之異稱，古以八尺為尋。）戲者多為幼童，緣竿而上，於竿上作種種驚奇之劇。其中最著名者，有跟掛腹旋兩種掛為全身突然倒投，一若已離竿者，實則有一足反掛，左右換易，忽起忽落，使人見其欲墜而已。腹旋為戲者僅以腹抵竿頂，手無所握，足無所掛，臨空將身旋轉，一如向天風輪。此外叉於竿上置以他物，如唐蘇鶚杜陽雜編云：「妓女石火胡，挈養女五人，纔八九歲。於百尺竿上，張弓弦五條，令五女各居一條之上，衣五色衣，執戟持戈，舞破陣樂曲，俯仰來去，越節如飛。」則較前更為驚奇萬分，無怪文宗以為太險傷神，有禁止之令</p>

<p>圓圓渴欲一見三桂，要求白十二快將伊送至軍前，早和三桂見面，以安芳心。白十二遂先派人趕至三桂軍中去報吿，目與百名健兒預備一輛香車，護送圓圓至軍。吳三桂得到了這個消息，眞是喜從天降，恨不得立刻就和玉人相見。馬上吩咐親隨前去沿途照料，又敎柴英一軍籌備歡迎。在自己玉帳外結起五綵牌樓召集鼓樂，並備翟繡衣華服，以及珍寳環　，伽楠奇香，叉把一輛香輿髹飾得鮮麗煥新，前後上下，紮滿了許多綵球，綴遍了許多鮮花，駕着四匹龍駒，駒身上都蓋了彩皮，且掛着彩綢，懸上　鈴，旌旗蕭鼓排列著足有三十里之長宛名馬，率衛隊數十名親自往迎，這個消息鬨動三軍。馬寳白顯忠等都來向三桂道賀。惟有張蒼虬等四人却氣憤得什麼似的，背地裏駡三桂好色心重，看輕國事。但他們也很要看圓圓嬌姿，所以也隨着馬寳白顯忠等來假作賀喜。吳三桂在官兵迎上去時，見左右官兵旌旗儀仗甚盛，心中暗暗喜歡。還見對面座頭起處，白十二等已跨駿騎馳至，遂勒馬以待。白十二見了吳三桂，滾鞍下馬，報吿自己如何與陳夫人相遇的經過。三桂大喜，許以重謝。一會兒圓圓的寳轎巳至，但那裏有三桂預備的富麗絢爛呢？三桂跳下金鞍，走到圓圓車廂之前，一搴車簾，說道：「圓圓別來無恙，我在這裏候你呢。」說話的時候瞧圓圓盛妝華服，端坐在車中，且喜玉人耒采依然當年，稍覺面龐淸瘦一些罷了。（二四八）</p>

<p>Allied Nations Plan to Hold Joint Conference; Changes Expected in French Africa</p>
<p>Washington, December 23 (Reuters) – The British Prime Minister and the American President held talks last night in President Roosevelt's study at the White House. No one else was present. Secretary Early announced this and said that the two would attend church together on Christmas Day (ecumenical service). The two are scheduled to meet again at the White House this evening, but the exact time has not yet been determined. Yesterday, technical advisors from both sides also met in another conference room at the White House. The President's study has been specially prepared for the British Prime Minister, with maps and other items displayed in the room.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 24 – President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill are scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech from the White House on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Washington, December 23 (Reuters) – Roosevelt and Churchill do not intend to discuss post-war issues during this conference in Washington. The first discussion will focus on current urgent problems. Once the current urgent problems are resolved, the future can be considered, with the hope of achieving good results for all nations worldwide.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, December 24 – British political circles are quite disappointed that Prime Minister Churchill went to Washington instead of Cairo. However, Churchill's visit to the United States proves that important negotiations are underway in various locations. According to news from Chongqing, representatives of the Allied countries are also holding important meetings there. Meanwhile, representatives of various countries in Moscow are also in discussions. London believes that the talks in Moscow and Cairo are similar to those being held in Washington.</p>
<p>Havas, Ottawa, December 24 – According to Reuters, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King is scheduled to travel to Washington at the end of this week to meet with US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – Australian Federal Minister to the United States, Casey, presented a telegram from his government to British Prime Minister Churchill this afternoon. It is generally believed that its content must involve the Australian war effort.</p>
<p>Current Discussion Issues Can Be Divided into Three Main Areas</p>
<p>Washington, December 23 (Reuters) – According to general speculation, the issues currently being discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill can be divided into three main areas: 1. The issue of joint defense by Britain and the United States in the various centers threatened in the Far East, especially Singapore and the Philippines. 2. The issue of how to protect strategically important areas at risk of German invasion, referring to French African bases and the Central Atlantic. 3. The issue of establishing a general strategy and managing their resources and manpower, using them in the time and place most needed to achieve a common victory. Solving these issues is essential for cooperation among countries fighting against Hitlerism. Opinions on the first issue are divided into two camps. The first camp focuses on defending the Philippines, while the other camp emphasizes the defense of Singapore. Regarding the second issue mentioned above, some people believe that a new era of cooperation is about to unfold. The Vichy government believes that Germany has lost its chance of victory, and this feeling is growing. Therefore, Vichy is willing to make various concessions, even seeking help from the United States, in order to preserve its empire. The eagerness for this hope is increasing day by day. It is said that most Vichy figures hold this attitude, and even if Pétain does not, some of his most trusted advisors share the same sentiment. What can be said for certain at present is that at this stage and in the future evolution of events, the final outcome will depend on which side gains the upper hand in Vichy. Since Britain and the United States share the same goals, it is necessary to form a concrete agreement. This move is only to immediately implement agreements based on past cooperation. Britain and the United States attach great importance to this meeting. As a result of the meeting, Britain and the United States may form an agreement on the foundation that the future world should have.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, December 24 – White House Secretary Early told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's night meeting on Sunday lasted until 1:00 AM on Tuesday. Although officials did not reveal the content of the night meeting, rumors are rampant in Washington. According to well-informed sources, the topics discussed included: 1. Obtaining the full assistance of the Soviet Union in the Pacific; 2. Preparing for Britain and the United States to prevent the Axis powers from occupying French Africa; 3. Establishing a base on the coast of Ireland to combat German submarines in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Selection of Naval Commanders in Two Oceans Allegedly Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – Political figures here recently stated that British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt held a meeting at the White House at 5:00 PM today. The highest military commanders of Britain and the United States were present. This meeting was actually the first meeting of the recently established Allied Supreme Military Council. The official communique issued afterward is believed to cover the issue of unified military command, a matter that American newspapers and the public have unanimously deemed necessary. Britain and the United States have reached an agreement. As for the detailed arrangements for the unified command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, they will not be released for the time being due to military secrets. However, important issues, such as how the US military will accept the command of the British General Headquarters and how the British military will accept the control of the US General Headquarters, have been agreed upon. Officials state that the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Pacific theater should be from the United States. General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Command, is very knowledgeable about the strategic situation in the Far East, making him the most suitable candidate for commander-in-chief of the Allied forces. Based on his ability and talent, he has a strong reputation in the United States. His recent promotion to Army General has greatly attracted the attention of the American public. As for the Pacific naval battle, the commander-in-chief of the Allied fleet will also be Admiral Ernest King, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy. In the Atlantic, the commander-in-chief of the Allied fleet will be a British admiral. Britain has two years of rich experience in fighting in the Atlantic and will certainly make great contributions to the common goal.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – The White House Presidential Office recently announced that the Allied Supreme Military Council met this afternoon. President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Churchill, American Army and Navy leaders, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, and British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook attended, discussing combat plans and strategic methods.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 24 – It is learned that British Prime Minister Churchill brought as many as eighty secretaries and advisors on this trip to the United States. US Envoy to Britain, Harriman, also accompanied the British Prime Minister back to the country. This morning, when Roosevelt and Churchill met with the press, Churchill said that the main goal of this trip was to meet with American authorities to ensure that the actions of Britain and the United States in the southwest Pacific are fully coordinated.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 24 – According to reports from Washington, President Roosevelt yesterday invited British Prime Minister Churchill and his entourage to a military conference. The American participants included Secretary of War Stimson, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force Arnold, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet Admiral King, and Lend-Lease Liaison Hopkins. This was the first meeting between the two countries.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – Rear Admiral Wilson, Superintendent of the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, has been appointed as Chief of Staff of the Navy to assist the new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral King, in handling military affairs. Admiral King himself is currently staying here, holding talks with American and British naval experts, and is scheduled to take office in a week.</p>
<p>Focus on European Battlefield to Prevent New German Offensives</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – The White House issued a statement this month stating that after the British-American meetings, the Allied nations will continue to hold joint conferences, with the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and the British Dominions all participating. Political figures here believe that British Prime Minister Churchill's stay in Washington will be lengthy. Moreover, the headquarters of Allied operations has clearly moved to Washington, which is also attracting attention from all parties. According to a certain observer, Britain and the United States will ask the Soviet Union to allow them to use Vladivostok as an air base for future attacks on Japan. This issue is likely to be the main topic of the next joint conference. As for the issues discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill, external speculation is rampant. It is understood that one of them is that Britain and the United States have drafted a "lightning counterattack" plan to counteract the military actions that Germany is about to launch. According to external rumors, Roosevelt and Churchill have obtained reliable information that Germany will soon take action. Therefore, some believe that the vision of these two democratic leaders is still focused on the European battlefield.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – After the first meeting between President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill yesterday, political figures here stated that the White House has now become the headquarters for the anti-Axis war. Congressional figures believe that this marks the beginning of new efforts and major decisions by the Allied nations. It is reported that the British Prime Minister arrived in Washington at 6:57 PM yesterday, and two hours later, he began talks with President Roosevelt. According to officials, the main issues discussed by both sides were how to coordinate the efforts of the various Allied nations, especially coordinating various matters related to promoting production and jointly utilizing resources. In addition, the following issues were also particularly emphasized by both sides: 1. How the Allied nations should jointly prevent Germany from taking new military actions in Europe; 2. How to closely cooperate with the Soviet Union on various battlefields; 3. How to prepare for and deter Germany's potential attacks on Turkey or its dispatch of troops through Spain to attack Gibraltar, in order to completely control the Mediterranean; 4. How to assist the Soviet Union so that it is capable of coping with new German offensives in the coming spring. According to political figures here, representatives from China, the Soviet Union, the Dutch East Indies, and the British Dominions will also participate in future meetings between British and American representatives. At that time, the possibility of discussing the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan may also be raised.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Announces Establishment of National Defense Transportation Bureau</p>
<p>Washington, December 23 (Reuters) – Prime Minister Churchill held a joint press conference with President Roosevelt at the White House. Churchill was very popular, and 250 journalists attended the conference, crowding the conference room, taking advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to simultaneously ask questions of the heads of the two major countries fighting together. Roosevelt chaired the meeting and first announced a less important decision, stating that the government has decided to establish a National Defense Transportation Bureau. The President continued, "We should explain that the British-American conference underway in Washington is only preliminary in nature. No Allied country in the world is excluded from participating in the common goal of defeating Hitlerism." A reporter asked how long it would take to defeat the Axis powers. Churchill replied, "If we take appropriate measures, it will be twice as effective as taking inappropriate measures."</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – British Prime Minister Churchill stated to the press today, "We will definitely defend Singapore until we can launch an offensive in the Far East." A reporter then asked about the situation in Europe. Churchill immediately replied, "The loss of equipment by the German army on the Eastern Front is unlikely to affect the combat strength of the German war machine in the short term." Finally, Churchill expressed his hope for British victory, stating, "Britain will be able to experience various serious blows on the battlefield" and achieve victory.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – The Department of War announced tonight that fierce fighting is taking place near Lingayen Gulf. Japanese air power is indeed very active.

<p>Manila, December 24 (United Press Flash) – The US Far East Command has just issued a communiqué declaring Manila an undefended city.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 23 – Newspapers here are writing articles commenting on the Pacific war situation. According to observers here, President Roosevelt's meeting with Prime Minister Churchill comes at a time when the democratic countries are in a very difficult situation. Regarding the war situation in the Philippines, the Japanese army has apparently prepared a strong and swift attack. Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese army has adopted this strategy, and recently sent transport ships to reinforce the Philippines. The Japanese naval and air forces concentrated near the island are sufficient to cover the landing of most of the Japanese army. Therefore, important military actions are currently underway. As for how many Japanese troops have landed in the Philippines, it is currently impossible to verify. However, it has been reported that the Japanese troops that landed in San Fernando and Agno are currently advancing south, and the Philippine army, protected by tanks and artillery, is also resisting. In short, the battle for the Philippines is just beginning and its scope is larger than expected.</p>

The aforementioned military strength does not include the US Marines stationed at the two naval bases of Cavite and Corregidor.</p>

<h3 id="e7">German Foreign Minister Issues Statement Denies Peace Overtures; Will Launch Large-Scale War Next Year <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, December 24 – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, in an interview with Ortiz, the correspondent of the Spanish official news agency "EFE", declared: "Now is not the time for peace talks; now is the time for war, until Germany, Italy, and Japan are victorious. Millions of people who have joined the Tripartite Pact know that this is the only goal and are willing to sacrifice for it. The rumor spread by Moscow that Germany has issued peace overtures is 'nonsense'. The war against the Soviet Union must continue until the threat from the east is eliminated. This is the main task of the German army in 1942, which will be personally commanded by Hitler. The German army has now withdrawn from the protruding battle lines to spend the winter. It is ridiculous if the Soviet Union and Britain regard this as their victory. However, the German army will still proceed according to the original plan. The Soviet Union problem will be resolved by the German army next year. The purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the war from spreading and to prevent the United States from participating. The outbreak of the Pacific war should be the responsibility of Roosevelt. Japan has already gained superiority in the sea and air within three days, which cannot be compensated by Britain and the United States. The signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact are now cooperating closely, and we will stop fighting only after resolving all issues."</p>
<p>Havas, Madrid, December 23 – The Madrid newspaper recently published a telegram from the French envoy stationed in Berlin stating that the German foreign military spokesman gave a press conference today, stating that Germany is now preparing to launch a large-scale war and the German High Command will make full use of the good opportunities currently available.

The German air force assisted the army in combat, and the losses of enemy soldiers and military supplies were great. Lake Ladoga has long been frozen. Soviet troops walking on the ice were attacked day and night by German planes yesterday. The Murmansk Railway and enemy artillery units were destroyed by the German air force. German planes bombed Moscow at night.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, December 24 – President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the Joint Defense Board of the United States and Canada had decided to make joint efforts to increase munitions production.

<p>Defense Committee Suggests Seven Items</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, December 24 – According to Washington news received here, the US-Canadian Defense Committee, which President Roosevelt announced yesterday, has now put forward the following recommendations: 1. In order to achieve victory, munitions production must be advanced to the highest speed in a short period of time. Financial issues do not need to be considered. The most important things are the quantity and speed of production. 2. To the maximum extent possible, munitions production in the two countries must employ as many workers as possible and apply all raw materials to promote productive forces. 3. In order to achieve maximum production, the production capacity and raw materials of the two countries must be united. 4. The two countries must produce in accordance with common procedures, completing the highest output of necessary products in the shortest time. 5. Raw materials and food needed to produce munitions that must be imported from the other party must also be distributed in the shortest possible time. 6. Legal and administrative obstacles such as tariffs that can prevent munitions production should be abolished during the war. 7. The two countries must take all measures to fully realize the above matters.</p>
<p>Methods to Resolve Labor-Management Disputes</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, December 24 – After representatives from labor and management in various US defense industries held a meeting yesterday to discuss cooperation methods, they have passed a procedural piece on resolving disputes, containing three points: 1. In the future, labor shall not strike, and management shall not close factories; 2. All disputes should be resolved by peaceful means; 3.

These "wartime tires" can only travel at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour. Goodyear's motive for manufacturing "wartime tires" is that the Japanese victory in the Pacific has greatly reduced the source of American rubber.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Important Steps to Maintain People's Food Supply: Success in Suppressing Flour Prices <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Flour milling industry guarantees implementation of new price limits, alleviating crowding for rice purchases. Restrictions on the manufacture and sale of bread, pastries, and cakes have been relaxed.</p>
<p>The reduction of flour prices by the authorities of the two concessions was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is generally believed that this is the most important relief step since the establishment of rice prices six weeks ago, as flour is one of the two main foods for the citizens. Recently, the price of flour has been from $1.40 to $1.50 per catty. Starting yesterday, it will be sold for 95 cents within the concessions.</p>
<p>Important Measure to Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>The Price Control Offices of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council state that although the price reduction is small, millions of citizens will benefit. The amount of flour used to make noodles in Shanghai each month is usually about 70,000 bags, which shows the importance of noodles in the people's food supply. The municipal authorities, recognizing this, first focused on opening flour warehouses, which was realized with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, and then reduced the price of flour by about six cents per catty.</p>
<p>Flour Milling Association Guarantees Cooperation</p>
<p>The success of the bureau in this regard was also due to the guaranteed cooperation of the Flour Milling Association. The association has 452 members, and its representatives have agreed to the Price Control Office to sell noodles at the limited price of 95 cents per catty and will never hinder the implementation of the limited price by strikes or other disturbances. It is heard that the Flour Milling Association has also agreed to fully produce noodles within the next six months. As an indirect result of this development, the number of citizens competing for purchases in front of rice shops will naturally decrease, as the general public can already buy noodles to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Relaxation of Bread Restrictions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to revise the restrictions on the manufacture and sale of bread as follows, starting from the 25th of this month:</p>
<p>Bread</p>
<p>All shops, cafes, other places, and all licensed bakeries shall comply with the types of bread and their prices approved by Bulletin No. 5660.</p>
<p>Variety</p>
<p>Bread, bread rolls, and biscuits, provided that unbleached wheat flour or rice flour is not used, the above items may be manufactured and sold in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Biscuits</p>
<p>The measures restricting the manufacture of soda crackers and plain dry biscuits such as army biscuits and dog biscuits have now been lifted. The manufacture and sale of sweet biscuits and fancy biscuits must be approved by the Bureau before they can be processed.</p>
<p>Candy</p>
<p>If unbleached wheat flour or rice flour is not used, the various restrictions on the manufacture and sale of candy previously stipulated have now been lifted.</p>
<p>The above items apply to manufacturers located in the Public Concession and the Extra-Settlement Roads West area who obtain flour supplies with the assistance of the Bureau.</p>
<p>The French Concession also decided yesterday that pastries made without wheat flour or rice flour may be manufactured and sold in the French Concession during Christmas and New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Crowding for Rice Purchases Remains Unabated</p>
<p>Taikoo, Xin Yuan, and Mao Tai warehouses have abundant rice stocks, totaling more than 200,000 bags. Therefore, the rice allocated to various rice shops, schools, factories, and hospitals yesterday was still collected from these three warehouses. It is heard that this foreign rice is a special grade of small rice from Yangon, and the quality of the rice is very good. However, the amount applied for by each rice shop is not large, so retail sales have not been smooth. The crowds asking to buy rice are still extremely crowded. According to the regulations of the Rice Grain Office, each rice shop must first verify that it is indeed white rice and that there is no mold, damage, or broken rice before releasing the goods. If the above situation is discovered after the rice leaves the warehouse, the rice merchant shall be responsible for it.</p>
<p>Designated Rice Warehouses in Batches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Management Committee has negotiated with rice merchants to determine that all rice shops that registered eight days later to receive and sell foreign rice in stock can collect goods from the Xin Yuan warehouse after paying. Those who registered in the second batch can collect goods from the Mao Tai warehouse. Those who registered in the third batch have started to pay the fee yesterday, but the warehouse for delivery is yet to be assigned. As each warehouse will be closed for two days of holiday starting today as usual, the delivery of goods to each rice shop may be temporarily suspended today. However, yesterday, each rice shop released a large amount of goods under the supervision of the authorities to meet sales demand in the next two days.</p>
<p>Payment Balance to be Returned Next Week</p>
<p>The Xiang Mao Foreign Firm has now arranged to settle the balances for the sale of foreign rice in stock before the 8th of this month for a total of 418 rice shops, amounting to 556,000 yuan in national currency. The Xiang Mao Foreign Firm has now settled separately and may return the full amount next week. At that time, each rice shop can hold the weighing slips issued previously, and the firm can pay on the basis of the slips. As for the remaining rice shops, they can directly register with the industry association. The association will report to the Xiang Mao Foreign Firm on its behalf after receiving the notification. As for the date of return of the rice purchase balance after the 8th, the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Huxi Orders Rice in Preparation for Sale at Low Prices</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the Huxi Special Police Department negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Management Committee to order a large quantity of foreign rice. Sales began on the 3rd of this month and were completed on the 7th of this month. It is now learned that they are still actively clearing rice sources and have allocated funds to order a large quantity of national rice, which will be shipped to Shanghai. In the future, the department will hand it over to various rice shops for door-to-door sales. It is also learned that the military ticket rice issued by the Japanese side will also be delivered to various sales rice shops in Huxi for retail sales within days.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Material Declaration Deadline Today <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The deadline for the declaration of important materials in the French Concession, which was originally scheduled to end yesterday, has been extended to today. Those who have important materials stored in the French Concession must rush to the Food and Price Management Committee of the French Municipal Council to handle the declaration before 5 p.m. today. At the same time, the declaration of important materials in the Public Concession will also end tonight. The declaration in the French Concession began on Monday of this week at No. 2 Fulili Road. Hundreds of Chinese and foreign people went to register. Those who registered at the temporary office of the Japanese Consulate in the Zhengjin Bank have also accelerated their progress as the deadline is approaching. The number of people who registered yesterday was quite crowded, mostly Chinese, with only a few foreigners. In addition, there is a slight difference in the registration time between the two places. The temporary office of the Japanese Consulate is from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., while the French Concession Price Management Office is from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Harkins, President of the Power Company, stated that the latest electricity reduction measures announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council will result in a monthly coal saving of approximately 7,000 tons. The company used a total of 41,000 tons of coal in November. Under the new system, the monthly coal consumption is expected to be no more than 34,000 tons, including the supply of 3,500 tons of electricity to the French Concession to supplement the required coal. Industrial electricity users will reduce their usual electricity consumption to 45%. Some factories will certainly be hit hard, but on average, the city's industry will not suffer unreasonable damage as a result. At present, the Power Company's coal reserves are sufficient to meet the power generation needs under the new measures, and since the relevant authorities have promised to supply coal, there is no fear of another major reduction in the city's current and power in the short term.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ge</p>
<p>Christmas Eve on the Streets</p>
<p>Traveling east from Jing'an Temple by tram, the number of passengers was less than a third of those traveling west. Although the tram wasn't crowded, judging from the silent and unhappy faces of everyone, they all seemed to feel upset inside, and one could hardly find any Christmas spirit this evening. West of Carter Road, there were no Christmas decorations along the tram route either. In previous years, on this day, the Christmas tree on the plaza of the American Club was adorned with silver ribbons and embedded with colorful small electric lights, shining brightly. Round wreaths made of colored ribbons hung on doors and windows, and tipsy sailors strolled in and out. Not far away, the Shanghai Yacht Club also had a huge conical Christmas tree, with clusters of colored electric bulbs, looking like fruits hanging heavily on branches. American gentlemen, abandoning their usual seriousness, would often attend costume parties.</p>
<p>Both of these places were quiet this year. The Christmas tree in front of the newly established Jewish Community Center near the American Club became the only decoration. East of the Paramount Ballroom, it was relatively lively. Dance halls and bars, celebrating this festive season, had all made some arrangements to attract guests. Near the New World, because it was a concentration area for dance venues, the Christmas Eve atmosphere started to become more intense. Occasionally, young gentlemen were seen walking by, arm in arm with glamorous girls dressed in colorful attire, undoubtedly couples preparing to enjoy themselves this evening. The windows of the four major department stores had Christmas decorations, but they were not as beautiful as in the past with their dazzling lights and colors, barely one-tenth as attractive. The Santa Claus standing in the window, with his white beard and red clothes, looked the same as before, but his smile appeared very unnatural, and his posture was somewhat tired. There were no cars speeding past with ladies, and occasionally there were a few pedestrians carrying Christmas gifts wrapped in flowered paper. Their demeanor seemed to have added a lot of luster, enough to make other pedestrians look dull in comparison.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve Dance Halls</p>
<p>Christmas Eve is the peak season for dance halls, making it the most profitable day of the year. Therefore, each establishment schemed and competed to show off novelties to their guests. The tickets for the first-class dance halls on Christmas Eve ranged from ten to eleven yuan, and the so-called Christmas dinner cost as much as forty or fifty yuan per person. The various levels of dance halls that didn't sell tickets instead increased the tea charges to supplement their income. The price of a cup of plain tea was outrageously high. Before eight o'clock, the tea dances at the Great China Theatre were extremely crowded. Some of the dancers were "old hands" who thought, "Why not have fun in the same way? Tea dances are cheap, and they can go home to celebrate with their families at dinner time, which is truly suitable for both inside and outside." Some came to report to familiar dance hostesses, indicating that they would not "scalp" them for the evening dance. Still others were stall-setters. Listening to the music at Tang Qiaosi's evening dance would require a twelve-yuan ticket, but now they could listen for free, and they were all blessed with unique voices, sweet and rhythmic, making it well worth listening to. After eight o'clock, a tour of the dance halls in the central district revealed that they were about 70-80% full. Only a few people were seen wearing paper hats on their heads, probably because dressing up for dancing no longer interested the young masters and gentlemen in this day and age. In the past, upper-middle dance halls were filled with balloons today, preparing to release them at exactly twelve o'clock when the Christmas song was played, allowing the reveling men and women to scramble and grab them in a frenzy. This was an excellent gimmick, but this year it was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they thought that rubber balloons were too expensive to play with. The attire of the red dance hostesses had been completely renewed, with white and pink dominating, plus heavy makeup, looking like a gathering of new brides. Some dance hostesses remained unchanged, sitting quietly on the sidelines. They seemed to have no high expectations for Christmas Eve. Very few people were dancing, and the attire of the musicians was not as splendid as in previous years. All of this was partly reality and partly psychological. Many people said that this year's Christmas Eve was the most miserable night since the dance halls existed, and I felt the same way. If it weren't for these few young masters and gentlemen going to join in the revelry, it would look just like a cold and deserted ordinary Monday night.</p>
<p>Originally, all the dance halls had planned to stay open all night on Christmas Eve, but due to the temporary measures of the authorities in both concessions, they had to obey orders to close at two o'clock after midnight. This was like pouring cold water on those who loved to play late. It was impossible to stay up all night, so those who were not yet satisfied accompanied their beautiful companions to the dance halls in the western district. Hard times couldn't stop them, and that's how this miserable Christmas Eve passed.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Truth About the Tragic Fire at the Ping'an Hotel: Those in Distress Raise Their Heads, Awaiting Rescue <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>To the Gentlemen and Ladies of All Circles in Shanghai: As we are in extraordinary times, the cost of living is rising daily. Fellow sufferers, leaving their hometowns and living in the Ping'an Hotel on Zhubao Road in Shanghai, run small businesses, hoping to earn a meager profit to support their families. Unexpectedly, disaster struck suddenly around 1 a.m. on November 29, when a fire broke out. The source of the disaster was the Jintai Paper Store, which was storing fuel. The fire quickly spread, first engulfing the neighboring Ping'an Hotel. When the fire first broke out, the occupants of the hotel were awakened from their dreams and hurriedly packed their belongings, fleeing in panic. Those living on the third floor and first floor all carried their suitcases downstairs. However, the hotel not only refused to open the doors to let the guests escape, but instead locked the iron doors, ordering the travelers to return to their rooms to sleep. It was discovered that the hotel was originally equipped with fire hoses and fire extinguishers, but although the hoses were attached, they were never used. When questioned, the tea servers replied that the boss said it would cost fifty taels of silver to turn them on. This continued for two or three hours, causing the fire to spread. Although the travelers repeatedly begged to open the doors, they were never allowed to. When the fire reached the third floor, the hotel suddenly turned off all the lights and selfishly opened the doors to escape. In the midst of panic and confusion, the thousand-plus travelers were unable to discern anything, and they fled east and west in the dark, rushing up and down, only seeking to escape with their lives. Immediately, order broke down, resulting in some being trampled to death, some being burned and injured to death, and some being unable to escape and being buried in the flames. The fire spread very quickly, and the staircases were broken. If they had not broken through the walls to escape, they would have all perished together. The various tragic scenes are difficult to describe. All the travelers suffered losses. The origin of the losses and casualties was the Jintai Paper Store, but the Ping'an Hotel should bear a major responsibility. If Jintai had not stockpiled dangerous goods, this unprecedented disaster would not have occurred. If the Ping'an Hotel had opened the iron doors and emergency exits early and let the guests escape, it would not have caused such a catastrophe. The fellow sufferers have suffered this disaster, and their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all gone. At this time of severe winter, it is difficult to survive. It was assumed that Ping'an Jintai would eventually have a good solution, but to this day, they still turn a blind eye and heartlessly leave the victims wandering in the streets, exposed to the wind and dew, becoming beggars and filling ditches. This is intolerable by the laws of heaven, humanity, and reason. How can a human being act in such a way? Although the Hubei Fellow Travelers Association has enthusiastically provided relief, it seems like a drop in the bucket and is not enough to solve the problem. Thinking about it in the quiet of the night, it is unbearable. We dare to ask all circles to uphold justice and render a fair judgment to comfort the spirits and save the survivors. This will not only uphold the law and value humanity, but also serve as a warning to profiteering merchants who hoard goods. What is described above cannot be kept silent. We hereby declare it to the press, hoping for your kind consideration and assistance so that we can alleviate our difficulties. We are most grateful. Signed by Tang Zequan and others, representatives of the victims of the Ping'an Hotel fire in Shanghai.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I have read a report in the newspaper about the export of prayer beads with inflated freight charges. Some of the details are inaccurate. I am writing to you to provide the true situation. After investigation, it was found that Gu Yourun, a customs declaration [blank] employee, inflated the freight charges and collected 600 yuan in water freight fees from the Nanjing Prayer Bead Company. According to representatives from the Nanjing Prayer Bead Company, the money was received and spent by Gu Yourun personally. In addition, a 40% discount on water freight fees was already recorded in the Nanjing company's books and has nothing to do with Mr. Li Weixin of the company. Moreover, the company has accounts to check. In order to clarify the facts, I hope your newspaper will make corrections. This is for your convenience.

<h3 id="e49">National Rice Peddlers Decorate Everywhere, Foreign Rice Trading Still Low <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's national rice supply was similar to before, still more than 300 stones, and peddlers were decorating everywhere. Although the total number is difficult to count, it is estimated to be not small, so the price has been falling day by day. Street peddlers are shouting prices of only 22 yuan per dou, which makes people feel stable and take a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions are extremely quiet. Moreover, today is a Christmas holiday, so merchants are even more eager to sell. They are all competing to sell, but the number of buyers is limited, and the market is also more uneven. As for the Bo rice, it initially opened at 242 to 1 yuan and 240 yuan. Later, it decreased level by level, dropping to 235 yuan and 230 yuan in the middle. In the end, it was only 225 yuan, a sharp drop of more than ten yuan compared to the previous market. In addition, early rice was sold for 236 yuan. There were also two newly arrived dujian trucks, which were more sought after because they had been out of stock for a long time. The original package opened at 227 yuan and 225 yuan. Foreign rice sales are still low. It is expected that after the authorities have implemented proper measures, normal and free business can be resumed. The recent arrival of 18,000 bags of small ground rice is said to be being unloaded, and it is also rumored that 60,000 bags of the 2 million dan of Wujian are already en route. Furthermore, the purchase of Vietnamese rice is also underway. It is also reported that the two associations are strengthening their organization and will cooperate with the Public Works Department. Because there is more national rice in both retail and wholesale, small ground foreign rice has officially fallen to 125 yuan, with 200 bags being traded.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Oil, Beans, Corn, Downstream <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Trading of miscellaneous grains was still sparse yesterday. The market was still weak and lackluster. Oil, beans, and corn all saw a continued downward trend. It is estimated that 20 barrels of idle Dalian bean oil were sold for 368.5 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold for 370 yuan, 300 dan of Dayou Factory vegetable oil were sold for 253 yuan to 249 yuan, 100 bags of Tianjin Xinjin were sold for 90 yuan, 50 bags of Fork Qing beans were sold for 80.05 yuan, 50 bags of Chongming sand peas were sold for 89 yuan, and 30 se of sand silkworms were sold for 58 yuan. More than ten bags of Pudong secondary du beans were sold for 85 yuan, and more than 200 bags of Saigon new Xiang rice were sold for 45 yuan to 44.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cake Association was established yesterday. In addition to appointing people in charge, it will also assist in handling civil food.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Recognizing that the Gold Price is Low, the Market Turns Sharply <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The cash black market first fell and then suddenly rose, and the price has returned outside the 9,000 yuan mark. This is because the recent sharp drop has been too great, approaching the rumored limit price. The jewelry industry and cash shops vigorously advanced, and a certain bank purchased at the rear, causing the timid to be reassured, and the market turned stable. From an initial 8,800 yuan, there was supply without demand. Soon after, it continued to decline, and a certain bank sold dozens of taels, and the price continued to fall to 8,750 yuan and 8,700 yuan. It was heard that the lowest price was 8,500 yuan. Jewelry shops and two cash shops came to collect and absorb at around 9,000 yuan. A certain bank then entered again, and it gradually rose to 9,400 yuan. The Tianjin gang vigorously sold about 100 taels, retreating to 9,100 yuan. However, the market had turned firm, and the cash shops and a certain bank continued to collect and absorb, and then went up to the last 9,500 yuan. The price rose by 550 yuan compared to the previous day, with a high and low of 800 yuan on the day. About 400-500 taels were traded. In the end, the price rose to 9,700 yuan. The exchange price for gold jewelry from pawnshops and peers was raised by 50 yuan, totaling 1,050 yuan. At 2 p.m., it was raised by another 50 yuan to 1,100 yuan (receipt reduced by 200 yuan). The exchange rate for silver was still 16 yuan, and the black market fell to 9 yuan.</p>
<p>The discount rate for remittance notes has fallen to 2.5 to 3 yuan per thousand, or even to a flat rate. The Money Trade Association's interbank rate is still 6 points.</p>
<p>Today and tomorrow are Christmas holidays, and the black market may be difficult to trade.</p>

<p>The current yarn situation has seen continuous sharp declines, and the momentum has stabilized somewhat. However, Japanese yarn prices are relatively high, and transactions have not progressed, mainly due to the slump in gold prices, causing public anxiety. The spot price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 3,450 yuan, and the factory price is 21,400 yuan. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 2,130 yuan, 20-count Celestial Maiden is 2,300 yuan, 20-count Moon Lute is 1,820 yuan, and 18-count Weaver Girl is 1,810 yuan, all of which are spot prices on the floor. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse factory orders was 1,550 yuan, rising to 1,580 yuan, but the transaction volume was not as high as the previous day. The spot price of Double Horse on the floor is 1,800 yuan, and some people want to buy it.</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Exchange, brokers, and other parties convened a meeting to discuss the standard for 20-count Blue Phoenix 12-pound colored ball yarn cloth. After discussion, it was generally decided to adopt a settlement method, based on the closing price on the 8th. The price of yarn fell by 295 yuan, and the price of cotton cloth fell by 10 yuan per bolt, to settle this transaction clearly. Future resumption of business will be decided later.</p>

<p>Lightweight, fine-quality flannel has recently been quite popular. According to the market, goods are extremely scarce, and factory production is minimal. Supplies from Eastern and Western countries have been cut off, so even existing inventory is regarded as precious. If buyers request samples, the prices quoted are all high, with the intention of waiting until next spring to sell at a good price.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Consolidating Client Margin: Public Bonds Temporarily Suspended Yesterday <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The public bond market was temporarily suspended yesterday at the request of brokers due to the sharp decline in the bond market, which was causing problems with client margins. The usual limit is only 4 points, but after two days of trading, the price has fallen sharply, nearly 20 yuan for some, and no less than 12 or 13 yuan for others, effectively meaning there were many 49-point limits, which greatly unsettled people. However, off-market trading continued to decline yesterday. Although the volume of transactions was not large, the price continued to fall slightly by one or two yuan. Class A bonds were initially traded at 57 yuan, and Class C bonds were initially traded at 54.34 yuan, followed by 54 yuan. Ultimately, there were sellers but no buyers. In the current situation, it is extremely easy to buy, but very difficult to sell. Today is a bank holiday and there is no market.</p>
<p>Chinese stock trading still had more sellers than buyers, and no prices were reported. Outside of the Public Association of Brokers, Jardine Matheson shares were at 60 to 61 yuan, Ewo Cotton Mill shares had fallen to 28 to 245 yuan, Land Investment at 223 yuan, Shanghai Steel at 178 yuan, Shanghai Land at 22 yuan with sellers, China Cotton at 8.75 yuan, and paper and wool stocks were all at 6.5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Longan Sold Out <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Due to the complete disruption of the supply of dried longan fruit, the numbered lots of goods have been released one after another. It is reported that they have all been sold out. The remaining stock on the market is all in the hands of merchants, so the selling price has been raised, and it will be difficult to lower it for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Lily Flower Inventory Low <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Due to a decrease in sales of lily flowers, ordinary dealers may enter the 100-yuan mark, but at the same time, the supply is also scarce, and goods seized in sealed banks and warehouses are difficult to release for the time being. Market inventories are gradually becoming thin, so the listed price has tightened, and yesterday it was already reported that it had risen.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Cigarette Consumption Undiminished <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Cigarette consumption remains undiminished. Due to the factories having no goods to distribute, the spot goods are scarce, and fellow traders are mutually raising prices, so the market is gradually increasing. British American Tobacco is 3,810 yuan, Old Knife Brand is 2,600 yuan, Pin Hai Brand is 3,010 yuan, Five Hua Brand is 2,610 yuan, and Little Fairy is 1,700 yuan (price per 50,000 cigarettes), all higher than before.</p>
<p>Match and soap prices are still stable, as the authorities have imposed strict restrictions, so prices are difficult to change. Beautiful Brand matches are 1,460 yuan, Phoenix Brand are 1,450 yuan, Rose Brand are 1,450 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap is 51.5 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap is 65 yuan. Candle prices have fallen the most sharply, with Sailboat Brand at 39 yuan per box.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Hardware Market With No Sales <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The hardware market has remained quiet for days. Sales of hardware and iron materials needed for construction in the city have completely ceased. Factories are also automatically suspending or reducing production due to the impact of the continued shortage of raw materials. In addition, general retail buyers and users are temporarily reducing purchases because they feel that it is not easy to transfer goods. As a result, although prices are high, there are actually no sales.</p>

<p>— Ji Ying</p>
<p>Everyone says rice is like pearls, there is rice but no coal briquettes. Cars have no gasoline. Diplomacy and doctors, public buses suddenly change three times a day. Dragons snatch to cook rice, how can it be hot? If there is organic matter, it cannot be moved. Cars can run, and those who drive cars rub shoulders. Three liters cost four yuan and a few cents, and forty gold is thrown away. Walking slowly is like being a soldier, the most difficult thing to do. Don't complain about the difficulty of walking, still saying that the price has not risen. Carrying half a load is not yet enough, perhaps there will be more consideration for robbers and kidnappers, who must race to be first.</p>

<h3 id="e63">This Year's Christmas <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Zhihua</p>
<p>The weather is humid, sultry, and warm again, simply not like winter. If the calendar wasn't torn off page by page by hand, one would think that the annual arrival of Jesus's birthday was an illusion.</p>
<p>In recent years, Christmas in Shanghai has been a carnival. Shanghai people, living in a perpetual Lantern Festival, hope for an excuse to indulge in entertainment, just to add some decoration. It is only natural that this religious holiday has become a carnival for non-Christians as well.</p>
<p>However, this year's Christmas is different from the past. The window decorations on Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Avenue Joffre are far from the scenes of the past. Santa Claus figures are scattered and countable. An endless snow scene is just a few cotton wads stuck to the glass windows, just to mark the occasion, and these may have been arranged a month ago.</p>
<p>Advertisements for Christmas dinners at forty yuan per person are posted in the newspapers. In the past, the first thought that would arise would be "the rich reek of wine and meat," but now, it makes one wonder how many people still have this kind of refined pleasure.</p>
<p>In the evening, the "Open All Night" dance hall advertisements may still be hanging high, but what about the scene of bustling traffic? Some dance halls are already inviting dancers to "walk instead of drive" and seek entertainment nearby.</p>
<p>So, what about Santa Claus's sleigh this year? Maybe he can only "walk instead of drive" too, and what he carries can only be bags of coal and white rice. ——Let's hope he carries these two daily necessities, so that the white cloth bags placed at the corners of the children's beds don't have to "queue up" in front of the rice shop the next day.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Christmas Tree Market <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>Before Christmas, as usual, all kinds of seasonal goods appear on the streets one after another. The most prominent is arguably the Christmas tree? In the past, as far as we know, the places where Christmas trees were concentrated were Jing'an Temple and Avenue Joffre. Because during the Christmas season, foreign families all plant a Christmas tree, and general stores selling Christmas gifts also place a Christmas tree in the window as an advertisement to attract customers, so the sales of Christmas trees are also quite good.</p>
<p>This time, although some stores still have Christmas decorations, generally speaking, it is far less lively than in previous years. This is something anyone can see. The main reason, of course, is that the number of foreigners has decreased, and the Christmas tree market inevitably sees the same decline. The day before yesterday, the author went to Avenue Joffre for a patrol. In the past, the corner of Route Mgr. Froc was a concentrated place for Christmas trees. This year, it has disappeared, with only a few flower shops putting up a few. In the shop windows, Christmas trees are rarely seen.</p>
<p>However, when walking in front of Jing'an Temple, the Christmas tree market appeared as usual before Christmas. The so-called Christmas trees are either pine or cypress, because in the cold winter season, only pine and cypress remain green and do not wither. Some are dug up with their roots, and some are just branches sawed off large trees, with four wooden supports propping them up on the ground, lined up along the road. Otherwise, this Christmas tree market is interfering with the vendors of the Buddha's Birthday festival, and must be moved to Route Hodebert, Route Haig, etc. This time, it is right in front of Jing'an Temple, and the number is much smaller than last year.</p>
<p>These Christmas trees are transported from the flower and tree shops in the four suburbs of Shanghai. In recent years, following the high prices of everything, Christmas trees have also risen in price. Taller ones cost tens of yuan per tree. Each flower and tree shop sends four or five workers to sit on the stone steps of the sluice gate and deal with customers. Otherwise, these few days would be the peak sales season for Christmas trees, but this year the situation is different. The workers watching the trees are all sitting and chatting, and rarely do people come up to choose and buy, and business is much quieter.</p>
<p>Several flower and tree shops, in addition to Christmas trees, have also brought in many ivy geraniums, plum blossoms, and other fresh flower potted plants. Because Westerners at Christmas need to decorate the house, and potted plants seem to be indispensable decorations. This year's Christmas, in front of Jing'an Temple, fresh flower potted plants are still on display, but more people are looking than buying.</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Downer <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Tutu</p>
<p>Although we are in difficult times, Christmas is still Christmas. For the sake of business, the dance halls still celebrate it in the same way, announcing in the newspapers that they will be open all night on Christmas Eve to welcome dancers to participate in the carnival. Unexpectedly, the authorities of the two concessions suddenly announced that all public entertainment venues will only be open until 2:00 AM on yesterday and today, as well as on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and will not be allowed to extend until 4:00 AM. In this way, it is impossible to stay open all night, and even the places that are usually open all night have suffered the misfortune of being caught in the crossfire and have to close early. This is really a downer, making the already sad Christmas even more bleak!</p>
<p>A Christmas dinner at fifty yuan per person, and a twelve yuan entrance fee per person, in fact, cannot be said to be too expensive when calculated according to the proportion of rising prices. Besides, the people of Shanghai have a great spirit of joining in the fun, and aren't they all packed to the rafters? Those who are usually busy raising food and clothing and are not qualified to seek pleasure are happy to sit at home behind closed doors and listen to the "Camel's Bells" in the air, and Zhong Jun spent Christmas Eve. If someone was tight on money yesterday, but his heart was itching, and he poured out his money to join in the fun, the joy of laughter would disappear in an instant, and the whip of life would follow closely behind. If he encountered some small trouble on the way home at midnight, that would be even more of a downer.</p>
<p>In the face of such a downer situation, the red-clothed, white-bearded Santa Claus will not be seen as an angel of happiness as in previous years, but will be so angry that his white beard will stand on end.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen, Dad, let's go busking!</p>
<p>"Now, sing another section, and I'll definitely pay double!" The chubby boy pointed at Mei Bao and said.</p>
<p>"Come and sit over here, the table is very empty!" The man called Little Li said in a drunken voice, pulling out the chair next to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Han knew the situation wasn't good, so he rushed forward and smiled at them, saying in very poor Shanghai dialect:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, what opera would you like to hear?" He handed a booklet of opera excerpts to the table.</p>
<p>"No, Charlie, I'll pay twenty yuan to take her back to the hotel room and sing slowly!" Little Li staggered out of his seat, his right hand in his pocket, pretending to be looking for money.</p>
<p>Mei Zi didn't have time to step back, but at the same time, she put on a very dignified expression and said:</p>
<p>"Sorry, we can only sing opera, we can't go to the hotel room with guests."</p>
<p>Mr. Han was very astute, and knew that if they lingered any longer, things would definitely get out of hand, so he immediately winked at Mei Bao and his own daughter, and hurriedly helped Begonia up, and everyone prepared to leave these two drunks.</p>
<p>"Don't put on airs! We have plenty of money. If twenty yuan isn't enough, thirty yuan is no problem, right?" The chubby boy shouted in a raised voice.</p>
<p>Begonia's face was already turning blue with anger.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute,...forty yuan,...don't go!...forty yuan...!" Little Li, who was even more drunk than the chubby boy, actually staggered after them.</p>
<p>"Bullshit! What do you take my daughter for?" Begonia really couldn't bear it anymore, and suddenly turned around and shouted angrily.</p>
<p>Little Li was already no more than two or three steps away from them.</p>
<p>"Dad, let's go back! Don't argue with drunk people!" Mei Bao, fearing that her father would suffer, hurriedly pulled on his arm and urged him to leave; the Han family girl was also helping to persuade him gently.</p>
<p>"...Don't go!...I'll pay...five...fifty yuan...," the man called Little Li was already very drunk and didn't hear Begonia's words. (289)</p>

<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>Christmas, Santa Claus always carries a bag of toys, paper hats, jazz music, champagne... to distribute to the upper classes!</p>
<p>People welcome the arrival of Santa Claus because of his kindness; perhaps it is because he indulges our sins, smoking, drinking, dancing wildly, all night..., all the commandments of sin are lifted on Christmas. However, he only favors the children of God, not the outcasts of society.</p>
<p>The poor boys who don't even know how to read don't know—can't go to see the movies that are open for Christmas, or receive the gifts given by Santa Claus. They just shiver in the dim corners of the streets, wistfully watching the wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys of other people's houses. Waiting for the kind Santa Claus to descend from the sky into the chimney, so that they can beg for something to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Where is Santa Claus?</p>
<p>Santa Claus is in the glass window of the chocolate shop, in the flower shop, hanging behind the car, on the stage of the dance hall...!</p>
<p>Now, Santa Claus is circling in the sky above Shanghai, observing, and slipping away.</p>
<p>Flour is not allowed to be used to make Santa Claus, private cars are prohibited from driving, dance halls are not allowed to stay open all night during the holidays...</p>
<p>Let's search the whole world, where is Santa Claus?</p>
<p>Santa Claus is on the bell tower of the church in Switzerland, gazing at the fires in the distance and wandering!</p>
<h3 id="e68">Winter Night Jottings <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>Winter Night is the night before the winter solstice in foreign countries. I was neither invited by a friend to eat a winter solstice dinner at fifty yuan per person, nor could I go to a "high-end music hall to play all night"—which in fact has turned into half the night—so I curled up in my small room, smoked, drank tea, paced back and forth to pass the time, and wrote a few jottings to commemorate the "Merry Christmas" of 1941.</p>
<p>Although not buying Christmas gifts, I went to see them anyway. This is also a way to spend the festival and pass the time. I strolled to a certain large store where I bought family bread the other day, and upon entering, I saw that the crowded situation was very different from the past. Western men and women, and fashionable young men and old women, came and went, and their expressions were not tense. The gift packages they carried were not heavy and about to fall, so I knew that the market was not good, and this affected everyone's pockets at this time.</p>
<p>Fruits on the market have long become treasures. Ordinary salaried people have sighed that they can hardly taste them a few times a year. Flower baskets of fruits, filled with Flag bananas, sweet apples, or California "Sun-Kissed" oranges, are not small in size, and the fruits are especially large. It is like a small kiosk crammed with more than a dozen obese women. If one person moves, the whole situation will be uneasy. The marked price is more than sixty yuan, more than eighty yuan to one hundred and five yuan...and so on. If you add two bottles of Samsung Axe Brand brandy, then one thousand yuan can only buy two gifts, which is not even considered extravagant.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department stipulates that biscuits and pastries can only be sold on Sundays and public holidays. At present, the biscuit glass cabinets of each food store are "penniless", with no biscuits available. Today, Christmas is celebrated. In addition to the holiday, you can also buy biscuits. From December 25 to January 5, each person has the opportunity to buy biscuits three times—a total of three pounds. According to the price of the most widely sold biscuits, each pound is about three yuan and eight angles to four yuan. Buying three pounds of biscuits will cost twelve yuan. When rice is cheap, that is the price of one picul of white glutinous rice? That is more than enough for the monthly food of a family of six. Biscuits are a small thing, but "how can they be ignored"!</p>
<p>The English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury used a large-sized headline to announce that the price of noodles had been cut. It stated that the price of noodles was about one yuan and four angles to one yuan and five angles per catty, but it has been approved by the Public Works Bureau's Price Control Committee to be nine angles and five cents per catty. This is good news for Christmas Eve, more than a full-page film advertisement or a red dance star's "waiting for instructions" announcement, which is full of "temptation". However, there are many gentlemen in Shanghai who "don't ask about the price of noodles, but only seek news from the dance hall". Although this news is published in the most obvious position, it may not be noticed by this class of people.</p>
<p>According to legend, on the eve of the winter solstice, Santa Claus comes down from the chimney and fills the children's stockings with toys and leaves. The next morning, the children smiled and rejoiced, thinking that this St. Nicholas could really come from the North Pole in a deer-drawn carriage. According to Western books, this legend started because the New Year is approaching, and residents all sweep the chimney to prepare for welcoming the good luck of the New Year. Now, coal in Shanghai is as expensive as gold, and only one or two out of a hundred families burn coal. As for coal briquette stoves, they don't use chimneys at all. In theory, the arrival of good luck in every household should be unhindered, so there is no need to ask for help from chimney sweeping. I would like to congratulate all readers, anyone with a coal briquette stove in their home will surely have even greater good fortune next year!</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas"!</p>

<h3 id="e70">New Year's New Film Lineup for the Five Major Cinemas <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>Since the five major first-run cinemas changed their film screening times, it has been proven in the past few days that most Shanghai moviegoers have become accustomed to this new system. Especially the night show, from 8:00 to 10:00, most moviegoers think it is very suitable for today's Shanghai. This allows them to go home and sleep earlier, or if there are few vehicles and they can't get a ride, those who live nearby can walk back. If they are interested, they can also go to a cafe or nightclub near the cinema to spend two hours.</p>
<p>Although Christmas today has been affected by the war and there are not many films in stock, the five major cinemas will still show new films as usual for Christmas and the New Year. According to the news released by the cinemas, the lineup of new films to be released is as follows:</p>
<p>Cathay will screen "A Woman's Face", produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring Joan Crawford, Melvyn Douglas, and Conrad Veidt.</p>
<p>Grand Theater will screen "Ziegfeld Girl", starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner.</p>
<p>Nanking will screen "The Great Lie", produced by Warner Bros., starring Bette Davis, George Brent, and Mary Astor.</p>
<p>Cathay will screen "Smilin' Through", starring Jeanette MacDonald, Robert Taylor, and Brian Aherne.</p>
<p>Metropole will screen "The Big Store", also produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring the Marx Brothers and Tony Martin. This is a comedy. These new films have all met Shanghai moviegoers on the eve of Christmas, and the content is very exciting. They are all productions above the standard of this year's Hollywood.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Notes on Listening to Opera <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Zhou</p>
<p>Recently, the playing time of operas has been changed due to the changes in gold. The opera repertoire is as hard as ever! The other day, I went as a guest and was very entertained by the audio-visual enjoyment. I recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>First up was Cui Ping Shan. Gao Shenglin's Shi Xiu had a clear and energetic voice, very similar to Xiao Lou. However, the singing lacked strength and was perfunctory. Gao originally had a good voice, but why did it come to this? The expression of quarreling with his family and the knife technique of killing You are still acceptable. Liu Binkun's Hai Monk, playing with Buddhist beads is a must. Furong Cao's Qiaoyun and Miao Shengchun's Yang Xiong, one fierce and shrewish, and the other haggard and weak, are both able to play their roles appropriately. Next was Qiao Lianhuan. Ai Shiju played Shi Qian, with light and quick hands and feet, and crisp lines, not inferior to Ye Shengzhang. The short steps were especially well-trained. The play of tricking the shopkeeper and stealing chickens to eat fire was wonderful in revealing the rogue tone everywhere, making people laugh. Next was Selling Horses. Zhen Fei's Zhao Chong, whether in his body, mouth, or gestures, was all wonderful to the smallest detail. I have watched it many times, and I don't think there will be a second person in the world who can play this role. The Guizhi corner is not enough to match unless it is Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu's magnanimity and nobility. Although Hou Yulan is still able to perform, she is still young and her skills are not yet up to par. In comparison, Zhen Fei's exquisite refining is even more evident. Wang Shaoting's Li Qi got the word "solid". Next was Qun Ying Hui. Cheng Jixian's Zhou Yu, except for the singing skills being slightly inferior, the playing with the feathers, the eye expressions, and the several feigned smiles were all superb. The predecessors' models are, after all, extraordinary! Xi Xiaobo, first as Lu Su and then as Kong Ming, worked very hard. It is a pity that his voice is strangely narrow. Although the rhyme is good, the voice seems to come from a jar, making people unable to listen comfortably. In the hiding books scene, when Jiang Gan helped the drunk into the room, Lu Su covered the lamp with his sleeve and quickly walked out. Xin Fang played this part, and had a wonderful quick walking posture, with the hat feathers trembling slightly, the sleeves of the water covering the lamp shaking, and a look of panic on his face. It was very good to see and walk. Xiao Bo did not have this, only slightly waved his beard. The arrow borrowing scene was neither warm nor fire, but the most exciting. Wang Shaoting's Kong Ming also had equal skills. The two yellow songs of borrowing the wind were purely in the style of Lian Liang. At this time, the ands of the table were rising, and the singing was covered. Ru Fuhui's Jiang Gan and Zhuang Ziyi's muddled state did not depart from the bookish air in the confusion. Di Fei's horse Fortune can be compared with the taste of the vulgar. Wang Quankui's Huang Gai and Yuan Shihai's Cao Cao can be said to be unparalleled. Wang's huge and loud voice is not easy to find in the theater world. Yuan's voice is broad and deep, and has both Hao's "ruthlessness", which is most suitable for playing Cao Cao's opera. When Jiang Gan stole the book back to the camp, Cao Zhongji wrongly killed Cai Mao. Jiang Gan still wanted to ask for credit. Yuan sang "You are a scholar, a basin of noodle paste" with a kind of shame and regret on his face, vividly depicting Aman's psychology at that time. Yuan Shihai's art is becoming more and more exquisite, and the limelight is very healthy. He also shines a big electric light when he comes on stage, and is treated like the protagonist. It can be said that he has won enough to lose. Xiao San Mazi took over the performance of Huayan Dao, which was ordinary. In the end, Er Jin Gong, Xi Hou Wang each bought the remaining bravery, meticulously and put their energy on the stage, which is much more. Among the three, Hou's skills were weaker, and he showed a slight panic when he spoke. Xi Wang sang heartily and never slacked off from beginning to end. The play ended at nine o'clock. It took seven hours from two o'clock. It is truly a new record for the chrysanthemum garden.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Concerning "Plum Blossom Dream" <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— He Yan</p>
<p>Perhaps few people know the story of Peng Yulin and Mei Xian. All that people know is that Peng Yulin commanded the naval forces to fight against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. They know nothing else. The play "Plum Blossom Dream" introduces Peng Yulin to the public, what kind of person he was, and tells everyone what kind of influence his personality and thoughts were subjected to.</p>
<p>Although Peng Yulin was a famous general of the late Qing Dynasty who attacked the Taiping Army, he was a revolutionary thinker. Under the oppression of the Qing Dynasty, Peng Yulin was originally a "loyal" minister. However, due to the righteous encouragement and persuasion of his lover, Xiang Xian, he became enlightened. The plot here is certainly not simple. From Mei Xian to Yue Ergong, Peng Yulin also gained many lessons in spirit.</p>
<p>The original author of this play, Yi Zhengbi, is studying a novel subject, which is really rare. The fact that this play was adapted and directed by the famous director Fei Mu is the icing on the cake, lively and compact, needless to say. The method of handling it is a hundred times better than reading a biography of Peng Yulin or studying Peng Yulin's thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>According to reports, "Plum Blossom Dream" will soon be performed at the Xuan Palace Theater. The author learned some news: it is said that the performance period is around New Year's Day of the thirty-first year [of the Republic], and the plot is divided into seven acts. It is truly a grand spectacle. All the sets, costumes, and props are extremely luxurious. The total cost of this play is estimated at 20,000 yuan. As for the actors, they are still the famous actors who starred in "Qing Palace Grudges" and "Isolated Island Men and Women," and their acting skills are quite superb.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that this play can be staged soon, so that it can shine on this desolate theater scene and satisfy the audience's eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Surprising Acrobatics on Poles <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>During the Han Dynasty, there was a "Du Lu searching and colliding" performance, which was actually what later generations called "pole climbing," also known as "long pole," "rope pole," "climbing pole," etc. Du Lu was the name of a Western Regions country, located in what is now Gansu Province. Its people were light and good at climbing, so they could perform this play. According to the "Western Capital Rhapsody" by Zhang Heng of the Han Dynasty, this kind of play was performed with a theatrical cart set up below, on which a tall pole was planted. (Note that "searching and building" is another name for a long pole; in ancient times, eight feet was considered a "searching.") The performers were mostly young children who climbed up the pole and performed all kinds of amazing feats on the pole. Among them, the most famous were two kinds of hanging: "hook hanging" and "abdominal spinning." "Hook hanging" involved a sudden inversion of the entire body, as if one had left the pole, but in fact, one foot was hooked upside down, switching between left and right, rising and falling suddenly, making people think they were about to fall. "Abdominal spinning" involved the performer using only their abdomen to support the top of the pole, with no hands or feet to hold on to, spinning in the air like a wind wheel facing the sky. In addition, other objects were placed on the pole. For example, the "Miscellaneous Records of Duyang" by Su E of the Tang Dynasty says: "The courtesan Shi Huo Hu brought five adopted daughters, only eight or nine years old. On a hundred-foot pole, she strung five bowstrings, allowing the five daughters to each stand on one, wearing five-colored clothes, holding halberds and spears, dancing to the music of the 'Breaking the Array,' moving up and down, crossing the beat like flying." This was even more amazing than before. No wonder Emperor Wenzong thought it was too dangerous and harmful and issued a prohibition order.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Welcoming Wax Candles on the Battlefield</p>
<p>Yuan Yuan was thirsty to see Wu Sangui and asked Bai Shi'er to send her to the front of the army as soon as possible to meet Wu Sangui and calm her heart. Bai Shi'er sent someone to Wu Sangui's army to report the news, and prepared a decorated carriage with a hundred strong men to escort Yuan Yuan to the army. Wu Sangui was overjoyed when he received this news, wishing he could meet the beauty immediately. He immediately ordered his attendants to take care of her along the way, and instructed Chai Ying's army to prepare a welcome. He erected colorful arches outside his jade tent, gathered drums and music, and prepared gorgeous clothes embroidered with Zhai patterns and precious jade rings, as well as fragrant jia nan incense. He also refurbished a decorated sedan chair, covering it with many colorful balls and adorning it with many fresh flowers, drawn by four dragon steeds, all covered with colorful leather and hung with colorful silk and bells. Banners and drums lined up for thirty li, and he personally went to greet her with dozens of guards, led by Wan Mingma. The news caused a stir in the army. Ma Bao, Bai Xianzong, and others all came to congratulate Wu Sangui. Only Zhang Cangqiu and the other three were furious, secretly scolding Wu Sangui for being lustful and looking down on national affairs. But they also wanted to see Yuan Yuan's charming appearance, so they followed Ma Bao, Bai Xianzong, and others to pretend to congratulate him. When Wu Sangui greeted the officers and soldiers, he was secretly pleased to see the officers and soldiers on the left and right with their banners and ceremonial guards in great splendor. He also saw Bai Shi'er and others galloping on horseback from the opposite seat, so he reined in his horse and waited. When Bai Shi'er saw Wu Sangui, he dismounted and reported how he met Madam Chen. Wu Sangui was overjoyed and promised him a generous reward. After a while, Yuan Yuan's precious carriage arrived, but where was the magnificent splendor that Wu Sangui had prepared? Wu Sangui jumped off his golden saddle, walked to Yuan Yuan's carriage, lifted the curtain, and said, "Yuan Yuan, have you been well since we last met? I've been waiting for you here." As he spoke, he saw Yuan Yuan dressed in盛裝華服 and sitting upright in the carriage, and was pleased that the jade beauty's grace was still the same as it was back then, except that her face was slightly thinner.

<p>— Bo Fen</p>
<p>A year before last, Clark Gable gave Carole Lombard a very special Christmas present: a three-hundred-pound carving of Carole, with the inscription on the back: "Merry Christmas to Carole."</p>
<p>The old comedian Frank Morgan has a habit: every Christmas, he doesn't buy Christmas cards himself, but takes the ones his friends sent him years ago, crosses out the names, adds the phrase "returned as is," and sends them back to those friends. But this is not malicious.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, Dolores del Rio had a most unhappy and painful Christmas. At that time, she was a bookkeeper in a ten-cent store in Chicago, but she was fired on Christmas Eve and couldn't even get a piece of leftover turkey. There is a large pine tree in front of Judy Garland's house. Last Christmas, she specially hired electricians to decorate the tree into an extraordinarily bright Christmas tree, costing more than 500 yuan.</p>
<p>One Christmas morning, Hugh Herbert's doorbell rang. When he opened the door, he saw a cow with a Christmas card around its neck that read: "Wishing you a Merry Christmas from Meisha Oya." A wonderful person always has wonderful things.</p>

<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>Unable to go to Batavia after leaving Datong</p>
<p>Although there are many nouveau riche in the film circle (referring to newly debuted practitioners in general), there are also many veterans who dominated the scene for a time. Gong Jianong is one we are familiar with, from Mingxing to today, he has always kept up with the times, even though his days as a young leading man have passed.</p>
<p>It is said that Gong Jianong held a very high position in the Datong film studio. Not long ago, he even directed "Lonely Soul in the Dark Night," written by Li Amao. But he was not satisfied with this. When Wu Cun telegraphed him from Batavia, inviting him to seek development there, he accepted and prepared to go south by boat. At that time, the Datong authorities secretly knew that he was about to leave Shanghai, so they gave him a script and ordered him to direct it, partly to find out his intentions and partly to imply that they wanted to retain him. However, he was determined to seek advancement and resolutely declined, resigning from Datong at the same time.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just as he was about to leave Shanghai, the situation suddenly changed, and he was unable to take a boat to Hong Kong and then to Batavia. And so he began to wander in the film circle, because when he prepared to return to Datong, the Datong authorities refused him!</p>
<p>But I wonder when this famous "Round-the-City Bus" (his nickname) will resume service with the film circle!</p>
