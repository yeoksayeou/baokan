<h3>美日谈话迄无进展　赫尔重申基本原则　严词斥责恃武力侵略政策国际纷争应觅致和平解决</h3>
<p>路透社四日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨招待新聞記者稱、美國於十一月二十六日以說明其遠東政策之牒文遞交日特使來栖後、迄未接日方覆文、太平洋問題之總解決、仍繫於日本之接受美國牒文所規定不侵略政策云、赫爾指美、日進行談話之八個月為談話與紊亂時期、其所以為紊亂者、以日方言行與在討論中之原則適相抵觸故也、</p>
<p>合衆社四日華盛頓電　靈通界人士稱、赫爾國務卿嚴詞痛斥日本在亞洲被征服國家建立軍事專制、並斥日方恃其侵略力以壓迫被征服之人民、乃表示美國與日本作可能之和解立塲、美國仍緊持其已宜布之政策、而日本撤退其在越南及中國之軍隊、乃為遠東和平最主要之先決間題、又稱、美國堅持日本在越南駐軍之數目應减至東京與維希政府在去春協議之規定數目、維希最初同意日本駐軍六千人、後又加至二萬五千人、但據各方報告、目前在越南之日軍至少達十萬人、赫爾之表示、各方均認為可代表官方對最近太平洋緊張局勢結果之悲觀表示、至美政府方面現尙在等候東京之答覆、羅斯福總統所詢日軍集中越南之目的及用意、蓋認日軍撤退為眞正談判開始之先決條件也、赫爾指斥日本之言論中會謂、日本政策之各方面、如政治的、社會的經濟的及道德的、均根據於武力、赫爾出此言時、並加重語氣稱、此舉與美國希望以和平解決國際紛爭觀點截然不同、赫雨又稱、在談判中余曾屢次告知日方、美國相信各國人民均應得平等待遇、而國際間之行為應根據於公正及道義、國務卿又稱、問題之各方面、兩國均會加以討論、包括若干主要爭點及次要問題、但發現甚多枘鑿、因此最近情勢之各方面全部某礎應交日本以一紙公文、在該項公文中、告以美之基本原则、赫兩稱、該文巳於上星期三交予日本矣、</p>
<p>合衆社四日華盛頓電　此間消息靈通人士稱、日本苟欲挽救其與美國之「和平」談判、必須表現廢棄侵略之證據、美國巳不再僅以諾言為足、而須觀看具有誠意證據之事實、羅斯福總統今日曾與副總統華萊士、衆院議長富奔、衆院多數派領袖麻塞狄色、民主黨員麥柯馬克、珂拉巴馬民主黨參議員希爾、衆院外委會主席勃魯姆、喬治五世民主黨參院財委會主席喬治等人會議、所商之事、纖為外交問題、</p>
<p>合衆社四日盤谷電　新仟日駐泰大使館參事石井稱、如華盛頓談判失敗、則日·美關係將趨嚴重、但石井亦不相信談判決裂即將發生戰爭、渠稱、如談判決裂、則美·日或將決定彼等之立塲、而不致互相採取行動云、</p>
<p>美不復爲空言所欺日對進退已陷窘境</p>
<p>路透社四日華盛頓電　遠東仍為華府人員注意點、人人皆注視日本之增厚在越兵力與英國之增兵馬來、並期待遲遲未來之日方兩次答覆、察日方之不即答覆、顯見日本了解其為世界一大國之前途、唯其答復之性質是繫也、苟日本唯命是從、則軸心喪失一黨羽、而日本可與民治國為友、否則ABCD諸國準備痛擊之矣、日本之決定、無疑的乃死中求生之問題、但此狼狽地位乃日本所自召、非他人所能為力也、美國今日不復為日本空言所欺、但視日本之動作而決定其應付辦法、蓋美·日關係現巳惡化、而臻於非空言所能左右之點矣、某批評家謂來栖所稱上週杉東條言論為人誤引一節、毫無價值、因自日相東條就職以來、日本行動之含敵意與挑寡性質、非來柄任何言論所能掩飾也、史家蘇利文對於羅斯幅總統外交政策素抱愼重態度者、今著文有所論列、謂美國已明告日本、必須停止對華戰爭不得對泰或對荷印有何行動、亦不得作進佔西伯利亞之企圖、苟日本對此三者擇一為之前美國即有對日開戰之充分理由、日本固野心勃勃、欲自成力量龐大之一國、果爾則日本將成對美之永遠威脅矣云、一般報紙評輪亦謂、華盛頓決無對日退讓之餘地、美國非威脅日本、亦非以不忍耐態度破裂華府談話、但不能有何退讓耳、巴爾狄摩太陽報稱、如日本不顧美國堅決立塲所在之原則、則必冒不復能逃之危臉、美國於此現巳予日本以考慮其今後行止之機會與理由矣云、此言可代表美國一般輿論、尙有一事亦使美國重行而不重言者、為東万納粹手腕之發現、此乃觀於維希所發向東京抗議日人干涉越南民事行政後、甫經半月、越南專態現已如常之言論及納粹外交人員在上海舉行會議事而可見者、華盛頓郵報論上海納粹會議謂、舊金山德領事韋德曼上尉、前在美國欲為希特勒布置其海外進取、今與其友集於中國、竭力擬破壞中國作戰精神云、</p>
<p>東條出席樞密院會陳述美日談話詳情</p>
<p>路透社四日東京電　日本樞密院今日舉行例會時、東條首相曾陳述日通訊社所稱日本四周最近外交發展之詳情、而特別論及美、日在華盛頓之談話同時日方通訊社又傳、東京之負責人士對於美國務卿昨日所發關於美、日談話之言論、表示坦自之惋惜、並以為赫爾在此階段之談判中、突然宣布華盛頓與東京問談話之內容、殊屬極不合時宜、赫爾之透露其遞交日代表照會之宗旨、實不可解、且足以引起一般人對於美國之是否誠意願望談話成功、發生疑問、再赫雨之發表會談內客、更將使談話前途趨於黑暗、同時據此項負責人士談稱、彼等對於美國之擁謢不適用於遠東現實之「過時」主義頗感失望、並認赫爾言論並增加日本有以更大謹愼進行繼續討論之必要云、日方通訊社又稱、今日東京各晚報均因赫爾之言論、對華盛頓談判之前途表示震驚及極端悲觀、日日新聞之標題為「赫爾非議日本國策、透露美國對日美談判之無誠意、」朝日新聞則以「美國企圖矮卸責任「為其標題、</p>
<h3>泰國舉行閣議　檢討遠東局勢　該國有遭突擊可能日越續作經濟談判</h3>
<p>路透社四日盤谷電　泰內閣昨會舉行每週例會、衆信對於遠東局勢之各方面、均曾加以檢討、昨晚泰國官方無綫電評論家曾謂、泰國巳臨生死關頭、於此可明白表示泰政府對時局之深切不安、</p>
<p>路透社四日東京電　據朝日新聞盤谷訪員電稱、泰內閣昨開會討論泰日經濟關係、及泰國在目前國際緊張局勢中所處之地位、國泰政府已決議出價泰幣七百寓元、收買英·美人在盤谷所設之烟廠及在泰北之烟草植塲、衆視泰政府此舉頗有意義</p>
<p>路透社四日河內電最高度之緊張、今仍存在、越南抱目前難關可以獲得解決、而避免戰事者之見解固不乏人、但泰國突趨變化之可能性、仍為目前之危險、巳往雖常有日軍指揮將取危險性的主動之象徵、但有資格之各界仍稱、現駐越南之日軍尙不足作大規模之進攻、但擇一弱點、對泰作閃電戰、固極可能也、</p>
<p>路透社四日東京電　河內日訪員電稱、越南漸知其經濟必須與日本之經濟結合、蓋其與英·美等國之貿易現巳完全停頓也、日大使芳澤與越督德古所作之經濟談判、漸獲進步、預料越南將接受日方在越南產生橡皮及其他原料之建議、越南各地長官明日將參加河內會議、現信必將贊助越督之與日合作政策、</p>
<p>西貢電台報吿日本不再增兵</p>
<p>合衆社四日維希電　西貢無綫電台昨晚廣播一報告謂、日本巳保證不再遺軍至越南、並謂日本不以法國屬地作為侵略泰國或緬甸路之根據地、又稱、該項保證為駐河內之日本大使轉送於越南總督德古者也、</p>
<p>哈瓦期社三日維希電　日本某通訊社、會於本月二日發出消息、謂法政府發言人嘗言法屬越南今後態度、當以太平洋戰事為轉移、政府方面人士頃加以辯正、略謂、法國現行政策、業經政府於本月一日正式發表聲明、予以解釋、其中聲明法國決心保衛越南、抵抗任何方面可能的侵略、此項政策迄未變更、至於日本利用越南駐軍攻擊泰國時、法國持何態度一層，則認為根本無此可能性、即在泰國總理本人、亦於十一月二十七日宣稱、日本駐越南軍隊、並無向泰國或馬來亞啓寡之意、要之、此項問題即使發生、亦當在法國利益範圍之內加以考慮云、</p>
<p>路透社四日東京電　河內日大使館人員栗山昨抵福岡、據謂、越南對於華府美日談話現抱鎮靜態度、自日大使芳澤抵河內後、越南官員對於日本在速東地位之了解及民衆對日之情緒、現已大有進步云、</p>
<p>東報不斷發表威脅泰越言論</p>
<p>合衆社四日東京電　日本各戰昨晚及今晨均指斥英，美「在還東採取侵略之攻勞」、同時復痛斥泰國之對日態度、越南之不誠意及不合作、並鄭重聲言、泰國如不接受日本關於經濟合作及加入共榮區之請求、則環繞泰國之局勢、將日趨緊張、同時泰使館宣稱、關於所傳泰國正遺派軍事代表與馬來英軍司令會商一事、「絲毫不確」、自日本駐河內使館總參贊栗山氏因重要談話歸來後、此間報紙評論涉及越南者日見增加、各報表示、栗山氏與日官之談話將包括　越南據傳漸對日缺乏誠意、　越南力不足以維持秩序及法律、由西貢美領館被炸案可知、　自外傳英國即將侵泰、一如侵伊朗後、越南威脅愈增、各報稱、由於七述之因素、日本或有以額外助力予越甫、以維持和平及安全之必要、「讀賣新聞」評論家細川稱、日本雖會保證法人在越南統治權之完整、惟法人正表示示其毫無誠意，不斷阻撓日人與安南人之關係、職是之故、日本必須採取「一較積極之政策」因「共榮區」之建樹、必須籍與有血統關係之土著合作也、「日本廣知時報」云、「英美現時在遠東顯示武力之舉、意在予日本以深刻之印象、惟日本已表示其在遠東之力量及目標、殆將不為所動」、各報又指斥英國在新加坡附近所敷設之水雷乃浮動水雷、此乃違反國際公法之舉、目或將如蘇本聯之最近浮動水雷所爲、損害日本之船隻云、「日本廣知時報」今晨之社評預言、協約國軍隊不久將佔據泰國、該報回溯泰國與日本於一六零六年簽訂條約、泰國於此項條約中保證對日本中立、並承諾與日本交換情報、職是之故、泰國現應通知日本關於「第三國之狡計與陰謀」、該報稱、日本「必須保護」其由一九四零年對泰國訂立友好條約所得之經濟權利云、</p>

<h3>美造成新艦三四三艘</h3>
<p>路透社四日華盛頓電　據海長諾克斯昨日公布之報告、美國在趕造兩洋海軍時、截至十二月一日止、已迭軍艦三四三艘、該報告又謂、新造載貨船海獺號、已於星期二三日作最後之試駛、不日可人隊服務、諾克斯昨在招待新聞記者時謂、日本得知保藏秘密、尤其是海軍機密之道、記者問、日艦噸數與美艦隊力量之比較、諾克斯徐徐答曰、「我自己不知之、日人對此悄報固善守秘密也」云、海軍部某大員在側插言曰、「當然吾人略有所知」、諾克斯對此報以微笑、</p>
<h3>日同盟社預示月中將有急變</h3>
<p>合衆社四日東京電　日本所預期對美國之「最惡劣之急變」日期之或將成為事實、今日同盟社已作首次之顯示、此預定日期即十二月中旬是也、同盟社稱、大政翼贊會之中央協力會議、定十二月八日開始、為期五日、一旦發生最惡劣之急變、則將縮短至三日、」其意謂倘「最惡劣之急變」發生、其時間或在十二月十一日的後、該社稱、此次會議將以一全日時間、作戰時之探討、以討論緊急之局勢云、</p>
<p>路透社叫日東京電　日日新聞今日社論謂、ABCD諸國、近在南太平洋採行動員計劃、顯為美國策動、如美國眞願太平洋和平無事、則此舉實屬費解云、朝日新聞稱、細繹威爾　奉羅斯福總統命邀野村、來栖開會之報道、覺德統現新自主持美·日談話矣、故不久當有迅速之決定云、日本各報對於美總統所發問話之性質皆未言及</p>
<p>合衆社四日東京電　「讀竇新聞」稱、除非美國改變其不顧遠東現實情形之經濟主張，否則無論維斯福總統欲自華盛頓第七次談話中得悉何事，欲克服困難、決不可能、該報稱、「吾人要求美國放棄共立塲、吾人對英、美行將在東亞發動之戰爭、不能長此以被動之傍觀熊度出之、亦未為央、美之行動所震駭、」</p>
<h3>美議員湯姆斯稱日終將脫離軸心　華認遠東局勢轉緩和</h3>
<p>合衆社四日紐約電　烏泰省民主黨議員湯姆斯咋晚演說稱、日本終將願意斷絕其軸心之聯繫、而與在太平洋區域有利益之和平國家合作、渠宣稱、「日本之聯繫係在彼處、非在他處、其與軸心之聯擊乃不自然者、最後必將毀滅、其目前所有中央地位之自然利益……彼已準備受一切國家之歡迎、即中國亦在內、而以平等及和平努力為根據、」渠又稱、「彼終必來歸、」該民主黨老黨員稱、以渠之意見、太平洋各國之互相倚賴、導紐西蘭、澳洲及加拿大入於「吾國與美洲各國鞏固條約之原則之實際發展、湯姆斯末稱、「英國及美國正與荷蘭、中國及蘇聯合作、因此太平洋已受希冀及計劃和平貿易之國家所包圍」云、</p>
<p>哈瓦期社三日重慶電　日本決定繼續對美談話、以延宕時日之方針判明後、此間一般人認為、太平洋戰事即將爆發之緊張情緒、巳大見緩和、大公報稱來栖、野村之再晤赫爾、必已接到東京指示、以圖延宕時問但英美是否願意聽共拖延、而給以選擇戰機之有利時間、實屬重要云</p>
<p>新加坡方面觀察日已開始取守勢</p>
<p>路透社四日新加坡電　據現象觀之、日本巳開始在遠東取守勢、例如近會調大部分戰鬥機與偵察機至太平洋中代管諸島、並趕築越南日軍根據地之防禦工事、駕置高射砲、日本向來積儲以備一接命令即司用以出　之材料、今須因以空其一部分矣、惟日本以此材料移倛海外防務之用、不能認為放棄侵略企圖、此或僅為一種當然的戒備計畫、然由此亦足微日本對於ABCD列强積極抵抗之司能性、固甚重視也、</p>
<p>路透社四日重慶電　此間華人各界一致觀迎英艦隊開抵新加坡、大公報社論曰、威爾期親王號之駛抵遠東、足使東京大為震動、英國已在目前神經戰中獲重要勝利矣、</p>
<p>路透社四日東京電　東京對英艦隊開抵新加坡緘默二十四小時後、昨夜東京無綫雷台忽以各種方言評論此事、其大意謂英國不能由地中海與大西洋中勝出多艘、故日本不必張皇云云、但張皇之象巳不可掩、其評論員曰、英海軍之開抵遠東、必須予以密切注視、尤共因東方之直布羅陀、大約將由英美共同用之也、此為日本應堅其態付大局之鐵志之另一原囚云、</p>
<p>路透社四日巴達維亞電　此間荷人觀察家雖認頃開抵新加坡之英艦隊、已使太平洋ABCD列列强之海軍力得佔優勢、但仍以為目前危機無和平解決之可能、荷印政府之注視態度、未見　弛、此間軍界現正密切注意華盛頓之發展、半官界之淤見、日本答覆美總統所問曷為駐軍越南之理由、未必能令美總統滿意、蓋日本增厚其越南軍力、用意存在、凡南太平洋之觀察家、無不灼知也、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>邱吉爾氏的警吿</h3>
<p>據合衆社倫敦電稱，本月二日，英相邱吉爾氏曾在衆院發表演說，提出兩點警告，卽：　戰事卽將波及東方；　希特勒隨時將引兵西指，攻擊英國。邱氏之言，是在辯論「擴大動員英國國民」一案時所發，當然含有策勵英人的用意；但在同時，却決不是一種誇張之辭，而是根據客觀事實針對目前大局所下的一種正確判斷。所以邱氏提出來的兩點警告，不但英國人應特別注意，並且具有世界的重要性。</p>
<p>邱氏所謂戰爭卽將波及東方，當然指太平洋而說，近天以來，遠東局勢之危急，已為衆所共見。而英國對此的準備工作，可說一步未曾放鬆，本週更將包含威爾思親王號在內的强大艦隊，調抵新加坡，這等於宣布，英國對日，只有行動，不再作無益之空言了。遠東大局之緊，於此也不難測出其程度。現時一綫的希冀，只寄托在華盛頓的美日談話上。美日談話，自從上月二十六日一度遭遇難關後，雖因來栖野村於本月一日二日，分訪赫爾威爾斯兩氏，而未瀕於最後破裂，但這兩度的會見，其氣象較從前顯然大不相同。從前大概還有一些磋商討論或意見之交換，但最近這兩次，日方顯已理屈辭窮，誠如野村所云，當晤面時，「只由威爾斯氏侃侃而言，吾人則默默靜聽而已」了。日本對於申述美國基本立塲的赫爾牒文，旣延不提出答覆，東京對美態度，也毫無改進之象；而來栖却依舊逗留於華盛頓，未有歸意，此其用心，不能不解釋為一種拖延作用，一旦達到拖延的目的，日本就將不顧一切了。</p>
<p>日本對美的一再拖延，其主要目的當不外兩點：第一，日本在印度支那半島及太平洋方面，還要進行若干布置，如在越南等地的軍事準備，及對泰國的神經戰，都需要相當的時間去完成。第二，更重要的，是日本對於西方的德國，大概甚有所期待：而德國為鼓勵日本急速南進，俾在東方困擾英美起見，對於日本的這種期待，也定必有所呼應，有所表現，其甚可能的舉動之一，就是攻擊英國</p>
<p>在這次歐戰中，德國對於英國，很犯了一些估計之錯誤：　當前年九月德軍進犯波蘭時，認為英國不致因此參戰，而結果英國却參戰了。　當去年六月法國戰敗後，德方認為英國已經不足重視，因改以全力征略東南歐，結果英國固然獲得了充分的時間去增强武力，而德國反因積極推行東進政策之故，和蘇聯發生了不可避免的重大衝突，終且導成德蘇戰爭之爆發。　當德蘇戰爭卽將爆發之前夜，德人尙認為英國可以與德議和，共組反蘇聯十字軍，竟不借派遺赫斯飛英，有所企圖，結果復全歸失敗，不但英蘇締成軍事同盟，卽美國也通過英國而與蘇聯緊密結合。　德國對於英國的生產力和武力，也犯錯誤估計，德國認為藉空軍潛艇之活動，可以破壞英倫三島的工業和對外交通；但其結果，英國不但能擊退德機之進襲，肅淸海上之通道，且能藉美國之協助，生產大量飛機坦克，除了供給本國需用外，更源源輸入蘇聯，來打擊東犯的德軍。</p>
<p>所以當德蘇戰爭進行了將滿半年，德軍對蘇閃電進攻已完全失敗後的今日，英國却日益强大了，德國對於她後方的這個海上雄獅，也不得不日增其恐懼，且須迅謀全力應付了。以前德國的野心、，本企圖打通高加索和伊蘭高原，入侵印度，以與東方的軸心國家日本完成軍事上之呼應；但是這一野心，最近已因羅斯托夫一戰蘇聯大勝之故，而粉碎無遺。凡此種種，都使得德國不能不改弦易轍，另謀開闢新的途徑。如本月一日希特勒代表戈林之與法國執政貝當會見，盛傳曾要求法國交出艦隊，也許正是一種企圖攻擊英國並牽制美國的準備工作。而這種新行動，又正是日本所期待着的。</p>
<p>可是現在德國到底還剩餘多少攻擊武力？英吉利海峽之險，德軍到底能否加以克服？或者德國能否從其他的途徑，去打擊英國？這一切，都尙有疑問。而箭在弦上的日本，於勢却難作長期之等待；或卽使日本有意拖延，以期待德國新攻勢之發動，美國也決不致輕易受愚，加以容許。所以邱吉爾氏所提出來的兩點警告中，太平洋大戰之爆發，為期也許將更早於西歐戰事之擴大；但無論如何，這兩者之間，正如銅山西崩。洛鐘東應，是密切關聯，不能加以分別的。</p>

<h3>中立國貨輪　維持海外運輸綫　英商輪全部停航出口後浦江沿岸頓呈荒凉景象　怡和公司經理巴拿馬輪負責貨運</h3>
<p>英美輪停駛遠東綫後、本市與海外交通、僅少數法輪等、勉强維持、英商賫賜洋行之馬勒輪、亞細亞公司小油輪、及美孚公司奘油小輪、亦已準備陸續南駛、馬勒Ready　Moller　Maric　Moller二艘、定今日赴港、太古公司停泊浦東楊家渡碼頭之三淺水輪、已於前日下午移泊浦西碼頭、</p>
<p>浦江沿岸凄涼景象</p>
<p>古茲悉司太萬通輪、前日下午由浦東移泊浦西二號碼頭後、昨晨忽改泊四號碼頭、與金堂·綏定·二輪併靠、停靠浦東之鐵貨駁十餘隻、及小火輪四艘、昨晨亦全數移泊法租界外灘本行碼頭、回憶法租界公館馬路至十六舖一帶外灘碼頭、向來輪船首尾相接、裝卸貸件、工人忙碌異常、記者昨日往該處探視、則太古公司各碼頭、僅泊三淺水輪及鐵駁十餘艘、羅斯福碼頭、沉寂異常站於新開河之碼頭、可直望至十六舖新江天碼頭、祗有木壳駁船多隻停靠碼頭邊賦閒、前日擬裝裕生輪出口之怡和啤酒千餘箱、仍堆積於沿浦岸碼頭旁、據說即將移去、</p>
<p>巴拿馬輪負責貨運</p>

<p>法葡各輪頓見忙碌</p>
<p>美國郵輪及英商怡和太古等船隻、奉令停駛上海、聽候政府調遣後、滬市航運頓遭嚴重危機、而工商發展、亦受相當威脅、惟據航業界昨日透露、目前滬市海路交通、尙非巳臨絕境、因法國郵船公司所屬霞飛將軍號大達南號金第亞號等輪、以及其他巴拿馬各商輪、暨法國郵船、行駛滬菲越南後、巴輪有行駛香港者、葡輪如拍羅托號、專自鴻基戰煤來滬、</p>
<p>怡和太古繼續營業</p>
<p>因航運措施之突然、盛傳怡和太古兩輪公司將行停業、唯據記者昨自公司方面探悉、雖該公司所屬船隻均經奉命停航、集中香港候調、但滬行營業仍將繼續、中外職員並不遣散、查該兩公司奉令將船隻集中香港後、自港來滬之各輪、中途折回者、計太古之瓊州貴陽成都嘉應四艘、怡和之裕生富生及貴生三隻、叉在華北口岸之船隻如新北京甘州等、則逕加速直駛香港、日陸輪二日由滬北駛、今亦已連貨帶往香港、</p>
<p>日本郵船撤銷三綫</p>
<p>日本郵船會社上海分社、三日接總公司電告、謂巳訓令馬尼刺·紐約·加拿大·三分社、即日撤退、聞上述三綫、均爲日本郵船會社主要航綫、日本與加拿大間、每月原有八千噸級般隻三艘、馬尼刺與澳洲間、每月有一萬噸級船一艘、擅香山綫則每月有一萬七千噸級船二艘、日本紐約間、每月有八千噸級新船兩艘、往來行駛、自奉令撤退後、該三處分社、將各留職員二三名、辦理一切未了事務、刻在檀香山新加坡及南美航行中之船隻二艘、亦已決定撤退、</p>

<h3>工部局考慮籌組華人必需品協會　由經營商人會商限價煤球限價應迅予抑低</h3>
<p>迄至最近工部局所公佈之各項物價、牛奶罐頭食品等類、多非為華人日常生活之必需品、是以界內廣大之華籍居民、甚為疑惑不解、工部局對於此一問題、業已加以注意、現正考慮籌組一經營華人必需物品商之協會、以便擬定華人必需物品之限價、現工部局當局、芷研究平準委員會所允供給法定外匯之分配辦法、其中煤斤一項、允許供給外匯、工部局現已將是項外匯、運用其中一部分、向國外訂有大批煤斤、故煤斤未來市價、必有顯著之跌落、煤球市價、亦可因之獲得减低、惟此在界內居民方面、以煤球為米糧以外第二必需品、目前煤球市價、實屬過高、工部局應迅即予以抑低、至煤球評價、迄未减低、市民傅有種種原因云、</p>

<h3>電力公司派員赴港　要求外匯</h3>
<p>自平準會通知上海電力公司、將供給其煤斤外匯减少二成後、該公司以此事關係重大、故於上月二十八日、特派副經理薩理斯赴港、說明該公司需要充分煤斤之悄形、聞平準會通告减少供給該公司外匯之理由、係因工部局巳獲得該會每月供給之煤斤外匯一百萬美元、已可購買充分之煤斤、故乃有此決定、</p>
<h3>續有商店二家　被吊銷執照</h3>
<p>工部局工業社會處現正與醫務處密切合作、調查各零售商店、是否照限價出售貨物、在積極行動前、決先予警告、但仍有若干商店、違反命令、截至昨日、被勒令停業者、已有七家、其中六家、係因售價越出限價、其餘一家、則為以次米攙入工部局洋米中、其中昨日被弔銷執照三日之二家、一家為肉店、一家為伙食店、昨日下午、曾對零售商店四家、發出通告、責成提出反對被受懲處之理由、據官方稱、工部局甚望公衆能予以急切之合作、隨時附帶證件、向工部局報告超越限價之商店名稱、庶工部局能立即執行工作、</p>

<p>負責經費</p>
<p>關於該所經費一層、救世軍方面雖可希望能獲得外界之捐助、但工部局現已準備負担該所以後數月之經濟責任、至於以前所望由兩租界與市中心區方面會同辦理、在離上海不遠地段成立一較大之乞丐區之計劃、今冬已不克及時實現、查乞丐收容所、前因上項計劃之發動、故數月以來、並未盡量收容、現在上項計劃、旣未能見諸事實、則乞丐收容所自應積極辦理收容、以達充分範圍、</p>
<p>並擬遣散</p>
<p>局方並將採取一切可能步驟、以遣散收容之乞丐、關於遺散所需之經費、擬即移用前遺散難民委員會所遺之款項、該委員會成立於一九三七年、方於本年八月宣告解散、所有款項、經巳移交工部局、以用於與該委員該局對於乞丐收容所負担今冬民入境、如由一方單獨辦理直接救濟事業、前途不無危險、故仍盼各界人士、對於此一慈善事業、能慷慨解囊、踴躍輸將、以利進行、</p>

<h3>黃金動盪不定</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、仍在飄盪不定中、先漲後跌、各方人心甚恍惚、因遠東戰雲密佈、香港到輪恐從此絕跡、該幫委祥興永力進六百七十兩、證券號進五百三十兩、合成順源祥和匯票商誠達德成進胃亦宏、但有朝鮮黃金運滬之傳說、由向代津幫之證券號在上午力售九百兩、（下午復進一百二十兩）、天元全日軋出一千零十兩、永成出八百三十兩、故將漲風壓住、價一升見一萬五千八百五十元、即回退、下午見一萬四千九百五十元、終見銀行幫進抬、收市尙軋升八十元、全日交易二萬五千一百四十兩、</p>
<p>萬五千元進而復出</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點開市即在抬風中高三百元、為一萬五千五百元、祥和天元永成來力售、頓見回降三百元、至一萬五千二百兀、忽見祥興永香港幫來補空、公和合盛明豐誠達德成爭進、祥和復購尤勇、價頓步見抬上、哄升六百五十元、抬至一萬五千八百五十元、奈證券號津幫及永成天元仍巨額傾出、鼎盛恒記德大順源爭賣亦切、當即步降四百七十元、降至一萬五千二百八十元、正午收市一萬五千三百元、下午二點開市即見壓小二百元、為一萬五千一百元、乃永成力售也、證券號進升至一萬五千二百元、公和天元宏慶、水永成來爭出、盤退至一萬四千九百五十元、證券號又來收吸、順源萬豐匯票商進抬、提升三百五十元至一萬五千三百元、四點收市一萬五千二百八十元、比上日軋升八十元、全日有九百元高低、現金號之本牌金、門市售價一萬五千五百元、收進比售出低一千元、</p>
<p>飾金軋升紋銀下落</p>
<p>銀樓飾金一日四變、大同行及新同行初掛升至一千六百三十元、後退落五十元、計一千五百八十元、（收進减一百五十元、）軋升二十元、紋銀掛小二元、計二十元、黑市十六七元、</p>
<h3>黑匯伸縮　變幻莫測</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央及滙豐兩掛牌迄無變更、滙豐等小櫃檯價均平、英美滙黑黑市英平美鬆、乃旣無正式行市、全視一時之供求、致有意外莫測之伸縮、美滙本來三元三七五有　戶、某華商掮客在大通銀行轉賑頭寸、步喊賤至三元六二五兜賣、不准申請之進口洋行均無扒結、但英滙則三辦士二五均少買戶、前途亦有放長可能、但至午後突又轉沉寂、照四點各方所還之價、英金二辦士二五、美金三元六二五、英平美長二五、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市況、英美金鎊趨勢穩定、市價站平、英金票又趨低落、美金票一度高至三十元八角、最後爲二十九元八角、結果與上日相同、香港票繼續下趨、日金票及朝鮮票軍票等均趨疲落、前者退爲二元六角、次爲二元二角、後者爲三元三角三分、</p>
<p>香港四日（週四）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩異常、各滙均無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津四日（週四）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、倫敦及紐約電滙、仍無變動、有行無市、申滙上升二元、爲八十元、聯鈔暗盤微昂五角、爲四十九元、</p>
<h3>雙馬多頭雖可平掉　終為廠方套出而疲</h3>
<p>紗市趨勢漸入安定狀態中、但大衆心理看不好、所以市盤一高、套賣者異常踴躍、欲漲不能也、壓力重重、惟某方面仍抱逢低必收主義、且購進之額已鉅、因金雙馬市情堅挺近來雖有套賣、然一部份已有收受意態矣、因為變馬廠單比較廉宜也、因之掉期貼價遂輕、本日多頭貼於賣方為二元半、最後亦有平掠之說、二十支雙馬最高價為二千五百元、低價為二千四百二十元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日掉期最後多頭貼出、因人心較佳、首盤即漲三十元、為二千四百七十元、在此價盤旋一時、繼以取引所開盤、紗布趨昂、人心帶堅、同時黃金甚昂、浮空抵補、市盤逐步前進至二千五百元、價格一高、拋空又復活躍、爲廠方稍有套出、情况較疲至二千四百零十元收盤、查半日間成交統計二千一百五十包、午後開盤市　帶疲、因大家看小、價為二千四百三十五元、嗣後在二千四白二十一元至二十五元　持、然新拋者亦具戒心、最後收盤價為二千四百三十七元、塲外為四十元至四十五元、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市況由堅昂而轉疲、走勢不脫迂週局面、蓋以各方局勢突將發展、至若何程度、乃使雙方忐忑、最為顧忌之因素、加以銀根聚縮、最使多方潛力之减弱、是以市態醞釀、雖已一反前例、而高出現紗、但終以人心之期待展開而呈盤旋之態、當上午開出、先以美棉再升、金市與廠單一度挺進甚勁、故期紗近期為二五〇二·〇〇、微帶堅勢、而一月份則又轉軟、以二五七五·〇〇開盤、二月份二六三五·〇〇、入後經金號與證券幫之吸收、一度拉高二三十元、惟旋又回下、午後起伏狹小、終趨不振、其因取引所之回小、乃影響一般浮多之脫手、故市價由徘徊而參差、各月期頗不一致、結果各月期各降二十餘元至五十元不等、茲列表於後、</p>
<p>現棉情況、平靜如恒、廠方雖無動靜、但細絨棉尙平、惟粗絨較遜也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市活潑而堅昂、晨初先因同業買進、及華爾街買進而漲、續後再因棉布賢易良好、及投機者買進、不斷挺進、結果昨日收盤售格、較之上日各漲三十二三磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市停市、又預測今日開盤市况、因連日美棉脚地堅實而看漲八羅比左右、</p>
<h3>棉布終難抬頭　絲光羽紗售價昂貴</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨堅午疲、依然盤旋局面、乃因時局堅漲、人心忐忑之故、結果白貨粗細布斜紋每疋跌五角至一元、漂染布跌一二元、本街成交各布三百餘件、客銷沉寂如故、</p>
<p>東布　欲漲無力、取引所彩球細布期貨晨市收盤漲五角左右、後市反跌一元外、本月份收盤價為八十五元、較前日小落一元、一月份八十八元零一分、小九角九分、二月份九十元零三角、小七角、現貨龍頭細布廠單軋跌二角五分、晚收為八十九元七角半、四君子嗶嘰三元二角六分半、收盤形勢轉疲、</p>
<p>絲光羽紗　日來銷用頗廣洋服裁縫幫咸有需要、售價亦極昂貴、昨蠟綫頭號絲光羽紗、平均每碼齊須售至八元半、　紗普通貨售六元半至七元半、下檔貨起碼亦須售五元之　、且市上流通者尙不多、因廠方生產、較之昔日平均减少三分之二、</p>
<h3>內債買進未健　橡皮股多種派息洋商股搖搖欲墮</h3>
<p>公債暗盤昨市多方已無力拉抬、於是轉驟疲軟、人氣本盧、多方乃又從事緩緩出籠、惟以買戶稀少、未能暢其所欲、大戶多頭尙未動搖、前途仍以國際問題爲依歸、昨上午市氣供過於求、開盤丙種即打破八元關、生興久豐買進、聯和怡泰賣出、但買方不甚踴躍耳、午後市面較平、恒康賣出甚湧、久豐鴻大買進仍在有意無意之間、市價結果一致回小三角五角、成交約計一百一二十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交天廚味精廠股五十股、價爲每股三百五十五元、</p>
<p>滙通洋行經理之英楂華等五橡樹有限公司定期分派一九四一年份中期股息、茲彙誌如次、</p>
<p>英楂華　十二月十七日開派、每股國幣二元、</p>

<p>英商四海保險有限公司定於十二月十五日開派一九四一年份中期股息、年息二釐半、用上海通用貨幣發給、</p>
<p>衆業股市寗靜、開盤價較前收為低、開後仍向下游、中途曾略吿恢復、但午收時又趨軟化、下午上落狹小、潛勢亦甚呆滯、</p>
<h3>粉市平定</h3>
<p>洋米停頓、國米無市、惟國米有小販運到百數十包</p>
<p>粉市續見平正、東棧粉因客帮停頓、仍乏進出、西棧登記粉自經工部局公布定價四十元零二角、直接支配於各各消戶後、市上交易更形淸淡、昨日成交金龍粉數百包、價回降五角、售開為四十元零五角、麩皮　以缺貨見俏、自經日商三鑫陸續拋出後、市面已見挨步回平、昨開回籠三鑫五十四元、又比前市小半元、蘭花牌客麩五十二元則小去元外、惟小麥存到兩枯、仍見挺秀云、</p>
<h3>散囤頻有脫手　雜糧食油回跌</h3>
<p>雜糧市况、昨見止漲轉平、蓋以實銷已因價高趨减、散回頻有鬆脫、故食油行情被挫三五元、黃豆平穗、苞米先昂後疲、統市成交靑島生油及豆油各二十桶、大連豆油十桶、大有廠淸油三百担、又菜油二百担、日華廠菜油一百桶、立德廠菜油一百袒、吉田廠菜油三百担、天津新金元二百餘包、又靑豆一百多包、苞米現貨三千多包、期貨五百頓、</p>
<h3>期糖無形停頓　散囤求脫跌風未戢</h3>
<p>昨糖市因聯營公司無形停頓、而散囤戶急求脫手、人心更感虛弱、致步步下瀉、期貨並無交易、僅成交現貨七千餘包、如二四粗白現貨十一月份進口者、上午開盤為一百九十一元、逐低至八十元·七十元、下午仍開七十元至六十七元、旋略見回高為七十元至七十七元、結果比前市須跌去十七元半、十月份上午一百八十五元至七十五元·七十元、下午六十七元·七十二元·七十四元、九月份上午一百八十元至七十元·六十一元、下午六十五元·七十一元、八月份上午一百八十元·七十元、最低至五十七元、下午六十元·六十四元、</p>
<h3>鴻基煤又起波瀾　——新貨絡繹有到——</h3>
<p>鴻甚白煤、自法公董局通吿限價、公共租界亦密切注意，辦理存煤登記、以資參考、籌訂售價、惟行家昨日起、忽又停止打單、致人心浮動、暗盤又起波瀾、惟新貨則絡繹有到、昨某輪又裝鴻基塊煤二千三百餘噸、業已抵埠、正在起卸中、</p>

<h3>搶親·徵婚·試婚</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>近些日子，局米一百卅，麪粉又限四十元一包，患營養不良症的人實在不少；然而　說少男少女們着忙於結婚的也更多，結婚本來嚴肅得很，此時此地趕着「大衆日」，似乎尙無不合。正是有書為證：「男有分，女有歸，貨惡其棄於地也，不必藏於己，力惡其不出於身也，不必為己……」君子成人之美，鑊子乘熱扔，美滿姻綠，到了明年結或許更不經濟，於是大家都來。</p>
<p>考婚姻之由來，自周公以來，似已莊嚴了許多。到了目前，雖然已不大當作大事業看，却無妨於神聖，除非孤立份子馬浪蕩，似乎都有其必要。道貌岸然的學究好引關睢，樂而不淫，不必說，美國的毛頭小伙子近來也在建議「打倒介紹人」，提倡直接談判的公開徵婚制度，門當戶對，像煞有介事；前進的革命家為了「工作上的安慰」，雖討厭繁　褥節，有些「機會主義動搖化」，但同居時也無非在執行「試婚」的義務。……所以我想，婚姻並非人生大事業，祇屬私牛活之一，但在宗族的遞嬗過程中却是稱「手段」。這手段的選擇，端在事前是否經過愼重考慮，過後的生活重擔（精神和物質）是否能應付裕如。</p>
<p>手段自然也有一落大派或不的，至於低級趣味的，在小市民層看來是：某小六子，現因百物昂貴，無力正式迎娶，遂邀族叔同鄉等候心上人姍姍來遲，呼嘯一聲，拖入「預備」之汽車中而逸云。不用說是「草草成事」的，這類搶親最近在洋塲似乎也會發現過一次，有趣得很。雖然搶親之風，自古有之，不必慨嘆世風不古；然而現在竟用汽車，光景類乎「綁票」，不亦可怪也夫！</p>
<p>袁子才入翰苑後，上表乞假歸娶，有「蓬山風冷，束觀宵長，簪筆則金粉飄零，早朝而衣裳顚倒」之佳句，此翻「洞房花燭夜，金榜掛名時」的作風，也是自古有之的，—這當然是性靈派古典主義」的，與某小六子之個性也有虎狗之差，可是某小六子底主觀的要求與袁子才自我的表現之間，像是沒有多大的距離，癥結都在婚姻問題上，差是差在後者不學無術而已。</p>
<p>袁子才的擅長就在「香艷故事」上，所以他誇大了「結合過程一，以為這個終身大事，就天大的了不得，由此也顯出文苑奇才，相得益彰—他還是有起碼的政治作用的，天大也不過表示詞臣本屬間曹的有閑而巳。至於婚後能　到工部局米，與限價麵粉之類，別人無庸憂慮：可悲的是某小六子鷄雖抓到了，以後餵食如何？（這裏還是小市民觀念抱歉。）喊汽車目今廿分鐘九元不算，亭子間的伙倉還是非開不可的，此之謂「愚民」，不亦大可哀乎？</p>
<p>於是法律不外乎人情，丈人阿爸也不大覺得東床嬌客有趣起來，搶親成婚的結果是報告有司，「小六子，可妻也？在縲絏之中，乃其罪也！」（見上月廿五日本報搶親新聞。）活該！</p>
<p>處今之世，「現實生活的嚴肅的要求」，有點使人吃驚。自己有了戀愛對象，於是要敲阿爸竹槓——這是小事情，但大戶人家與光桿子的結果，往往竟無虎狗之差，「不亦大可哀乎？」</p>
<h3>硬要面子活受罪　我請你喝喜酒</h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>在茶室裏小坐，碰到一個姓吳的朋友，彼此寒喧了一陣之後，聽他說起現在某外商企業公司服務，很得洋大班的靑眯，薪水賺到三百元一月，這使近況蹇滯的我不勝豔羨之至。</p>
<p>「老黃！下個月請你喫喜酒。」小吳呷了兩口茶，滿面春風的說。</p>
<p>什麼，以前我知道他是沒有愛人的，也從未聽到訂婚的消息；半年不見，一下子就結起婚來，怎不令人佩服小吳閃雷戰的成功。當茲百物奇昂，生活程度高到頂點的勢口，却有一筆鉅款來解決終身大事，更使咱這窮小子分外眼紅。</p>
<p>我說：「小吳！到底你的噱頭大，進賬好，在這種非常時期裹，愜愜意意的做新郎倌……大概幹這頭事，要用去好幾千吧？」</p>
<p>「當然囉，少了就不行，定親時先要這幾樣首飾：赤金手鐲一枚，白金手錶一隻，鑽戒兩隻，珠耳環一副，單是這區區四色，代價已是很可觀了。」</p>
<p>「哦！哦！」</p>
<p>「赤金手鐲雖只一兩二錢重，却要一千六百多元，再加手錶九百元，鑽戒一對共一千元，珠環一副五百元，共計四千六百元。」</p>
<p>「哦！哦！」</p>
<p>「還有，還有春季冬季大衣各一件，綢旗袍四件，其他茶禮等一應在內，又是二千多元。「哦哦哦……」</p>
<p>「此外，化了二千二百元買新房裹的傢具，連正日那天預算凈開銷六百元，哈！哈！雖說不像樣，幹一頭事，也非九千多塊錢不辦呢。」小吳一連串的說下去，不知是誇稱富有呢，還是在譏笑我這窮光蛋的寒酸。</p>
<p>「九千多塊錢！竟要這樣大的數目；看你不出，倒是個有錢朋友。」我心裏雖在猜疑不定，嘴上却還是恭維他幾句。</p>
<p>「有錢……唉！不瞞你說，全都是借來的。」他的臉上突然蒙着一重憂鬱。</p>
<p>「唔，借來的！不用騙人了，誰相信。」我微微地搖着頭。</p>
<p>「不借，哼！那裏來的這些錢；告訴你吧，我還出了二分錢的重利息呢。」</p>
<p>「眞的！這怎麼好，結了婚，一加一等於二，生了兒子，二加一等於三，將來食指衆多，用度激增；進益却為了償付利息的關係，打了個七折八扣，小吳！這日子就難過啦。無債一身輕，你不能力求節省麼。」</p>
<p>「節省，老兄眞是只知其一，不知其二，現在這努口，誰不講究虛榮，誰不要面子；你打算節省，你就一輩子休想討到老婆。」小吳一本正經的說，這是天經地義之論，討老婆的經騐之談，我還敢說他半點不是麼；可是小吳將怎樣的去解脫身上的重負呢？</p>
<p>喜酒！喜酒！是債與利息的交流，愁與煩惱的前奏；喜從何來？何喜之有？</p>
<h3>囤積者無孔不入</h3>
<p>— 揚子江擬意樂帥央繪圖</p>
<h3>買客多多注意　衡量的問題</h3>
<p>— 澄秋</p>
<p>自當局限制物價以來，給予囤積者一個嚴重的打擊，最近又限制一般日用品的價格，以抑止奸商之操縱，當局之惠賜，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>在以前一般主婦每日感到頭痛的就是買菜，各物飛漲，菜塲裏雖擺列着各種菜蔬，但總是不曉得買那樣好，普通案菜稍微買點，總要到　四五元之譜，要是想吃點魚肉，啊！那眞是小得了。</p>
<p>限制物價以後，一般菜蔬是便宜了，偶然想買點肉吃吃，結果價格雖然賤了，但是現在的一斤肉遠不如以前的一斤肉多，另外有些東西也是如此，在衡量上總比以前少，這完全是商人的奸謀，一般平民雖享着當局限制物價的利益，但在暗地裏，仍多吃虧，即如一般蔬菜，如果用目己所帶的秤和用賣菜者的秤，價格即有差別。</p>
<p>當局所頒的價格，在衡量上是一定的，而現在在買者和賣者當中却有兩種不同的衡量，那麼這還是買者的秤太大不合當局的規定，抑是店家的秤太小呢？如果是店家的秤太小，那就不合當局的限制而有違法令，所以希望當局在限制物價的惠政以外，對于市上一般日用品的衡量，加以深切的注意，使一般奸商不能取巧故違法令，一方面一般平民却能受到更大更確切的利益。除惡務盡，恐怕也是當局所不容忽視的罷。</p>
<p>（編者按）當局對於市上好商使用不正當的衡量器，已密切注意；查出而予以嚴懲者頗多。茲正告奸商切勿其頑不靈，再以身試法，一方！「吃虧在自已頭上」的買客們，亦請自己多多留心為要。（貨物如屬液體者，不妨多備一個衡量器。）</p>

<p>「有什麼好的主意呢？」秋海棠顯得很困惑地說。</p>
<p>梅寳因為聽他在說話的時候，又連續的咳了幾次嗽，便不就回答，先自站起身來，把預先煮就的紅棗湯斟了一碗出來，端給她父親喝</p>
<p>「爸爸，我不是還能唱戲嗎…」</p>

<h3>卡通攝制新發明</h3>
<p>— 載揚</p>
<p>攝製卡通片並不是一件容易的工作，它底繁難情形，大家都知道。華德狄斯耐，動員幾百人，化了好多年心血，才能完成一部白雪公主。即是中國的鐵扇公主，報上不是也說要二百多人才能畫成的嗎？而且這兩百多個人，並非阿毛阿狗，而是畫家！因為卡通片的人物，是死的不會自己動作。必須畫上個幾十張，才能表示出一個動作來。比方說舉手吧，幾十張畫都是差不多，只是手逐漸提高，這幾十張畫裏的背景，都是一律的。因此攝製卡通者便感到這層重複工作的麻煩。</p>
<p>現在好萊塢已經發明一種新的攝製法，就是卡通片裏除了人物以外，可以配攝上去眞實的背景。</p>
<p>原來在一種透明賽珞璐薄片上，畫成不透明的像——每個人物都用黑白顏料。在光亮處看去，看見的只是圖畫的黑的輪廓，但用了反射光照它，那圖畫便很淸楚地呈現出來了。於是上面的一對照明的燈光射到畫片上，同時，眞實的電影佈景從透明的賽珞璐下面映射過來，圖畫的人物——即不透明部分便把佈景上部分遮沒。用攝影機將背景和連續圖畫同時拍攝，直至背景和畫裏的人物有了更動為止。這樣放映出來，我們便可以看到畫中人物而留存在眞實的世界上了！</p>
<p>這種新卡通的攝製機上只須配上一副光學儀器集光鏡就行了。假使要攝五彩的只需賽珞璐上的人物畫成五彩，再在集光鏡那裏加一套轉動的顏色分濾器就行。</p>
<p>這種新卡通比現在的卡通攝製好在迅速和經濟。</p>
<p>等着吧，不久將來，我們就能够看到了。</p>

<h3>U.S.-Japan Talks Still Show No Progress: Hull Reaffirms Basic Principles, Sternly Condemns Reliance on Force and Aggression; International Disputes Should Seek Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that after the U.S. submitted a note on November 26, explaining its Far Eastern policy to the Japanese special envoy Kurusu, no reply has yet been received from Japan. The overall resolution of the Pacific problem still hinges on Japan's acceptance of the non-aggression policy stipulated in the U.S. note. Hull pointed out that the eight months of talks between the U.S. and Japan were a period of "talks and disorder," the disorder being because the words and actions of the Japanese side were directly contrary to the principles under discussion.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 4th: Informed sources say that Secretary of State Hull sternly condemned Japan for establishing a military autocracy in the conquered countries of Asia, and for relying on its aggressive force to oppress the conquered people. This shows the U.S.'s stance on possible reconciliation with Japan: the U.S. still firmly adheres to its declared policies, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam and China is the most important prerequisite for peace in the Far East. It is also said that the U.S. insists that the number of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam should be reduced to the number stipulated in the agreement reached between Tokyo and the Vichy government last spring. Vichy initially agreed to 6,000 Japanese troops, which was later increased to 25,000, but according to various reports, there are currently at least 100,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam. Hull's statement is widely regarded as an official expression of pessimism regarding the outcome of the recent tensions in the Pacific. The U.S. government is still awaiting a reply from Tokyo regarding President Roosevelt's inquiry into the purpose and intention of the Japanese troop concentration in Vietnam, as it considers the withdrawal of Japanese troops a prerequisite for the start of genuine negotiations. In his criticism of Japan, Hull said that all aspects of Japanese policy, such as political, social, economic, and moral, are based on force. Hull emphasized when making this statement that this is completely different from the U.S.'s view of resolving international disputes peacefully. Hull also said that during the negotiations, he repeatedly told the Japanese side that the U.S. believes that all people should be treated equally and that international behavior should be based on justice and morality. The Secretary of State also said that all aspects of the problem have been discussed by both countries, including some major and minor issues, but many inconsistencies were found. Therefore, all aspects of the recent situation should be based on a document delivered to Japan, in which the basic principles of the U.S. are stated. Hull said that the document was delivered to Japan last Wednesday.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 4th: Informed sources here say that if Japan wants to save its "peace" talks with the U.S., it must show evidence of abandoning aggression. The U.S. is no longer satisfied with mere promises, but must see facts that provide evidence of sincerity. President Roosevelt met today with Vice President Wallace, Speaker of the House Rayburn, House Majority Leader McCormack, Democrat McHale, Alabama Democratic Senator Hill, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, and Georgia Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman George. The discussions primarily concerned diplomatic issues.</p>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 4th: Ishii, the new Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, said that if the Washington talks fail, U.S.-Japan relations will become serious, but Ishii also does not believe that a breakdown in the talks will immediately lead to war. He said that if the talks break down, the U.S. and Japan may decide on their positions without taking action against each other.</p>
<p>U.S. No Longer Deceived by Empty Words; Japan Finds Itself in a Difficult Position Regarding Advance or Retreat</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th: The Far East remains a point of attention for Washington officials. Everyone is watching Japan's increasing troop strength in Vietnam and Britain's increasing troop strength in Malaya, and awaiting the delayed replies from the Japanese side. The fact that the Japanese side has not replied immediately shows that Japan understands its future as a major power in the world depends on the nature of its reply. If Japan complies, the Axis powers will lose a member, and Japan can befriend democratic countries. Otherwise, the ABCD powers are prepared to strike hard. Japan's decision is undoubtedly a matter of survival, but this predicament is of Japan's own making, and no one else can help. The U.S. is no longer deceived by Japan's empty words, but will decide on its response based on Japan's actions. U.S.-Japan relations have now deteriorated to a point where they cannot be swayed by empty words. One critic said that Kurusu's claim that Prime Minister Tojo's remarks last week were misinterpreted is worthless, because since Prime Minister Tojo took office, the hostile and provocative nature of Japan's actions cannot be concealed by any remarks made by Kurusu. Historian Sullivan, who has always been cautious about President Roosevelt's foreign policy, wrote that the U.S. has made it clear to Japan that it must stop the war against China, must not take any action against Thailand or the Dutch East Indies, and must not attempt to invade Siberia. If Japan chooses to do any of these three things, the U.S. will have sufficient reason to declare war on Japan. Japan is ambitious and wants to become a powerful country on its own, in which case Japan will become a permanent threat to the U.S. General newspaper commentary also says that Washington has no room for concession to Japan. The U.S. is not threatening Japan, nor is it breaking off the Washington talks with impatience, but it cannot make any concessions. The Baltimore Sun said that if Japan disregards the principles that constitute the U.S.'s firm stance, it will risk an inescapable danger. The U.S. has now given Japan the opportunity and reason to consider its future actions. This statement can represent general American public opinion. Another matter that makes the U.S. take action rather than just talk is the discovery of East Asian Nazi tactics. This can be seen from the statement issued by Vichy protesting to Tokyo about Japanese interference in Vietnamese civil administration, just half a month ago, that the situation in Vietnam has now returned to normal, and from the meeting of Nazi diplomats in Shanghai. The Washington Post commented on the Nazi meeting in Shanghai, saying that Captain Weidemann, the former German Consul in San Francisco, who previously wanted to arrange for Hitler to advance overseas in the U.S., is now gathering with his friends in China, trying to undermine China's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Tojo Attends Privy Council Meeting, Details U.S.-Japan Talks</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: At today's regular meeting of the Japanese Privy Council, Prime Minister Tojo detailed the recent diplomatic developments around Japan, as described by Japanese news agencies, and especially discussed the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. At the same time, Japanese news agencies reported that responsible figures in Tokyo expressed frank regret over the remarks made by the U.S. Secretary of State yesterday regarding the U.S.-Japan talks, and believed that Hull's sudden announcement of the content of the Washington-Tokyo talks at this stage of the negotiations was extremely inappropriate. Hull's revealing the purpose of his note to the Japanese representative is incomprehensible and is enough to raise questions among the general public about whether the U.S. sincerely wants the talks to succeed. Furthermore, Hull's publication of the content of the talks will further darken the future of the talks. At the same time, according to these responsible figures, they are disappointed with the U.S.'s adherence to "outdated" doctrines that do not apply to the realities of the Far East, and believe that Hull's remarks further increase Japan's need to proceed with continued discussions with greater caution. Japanese news agencies also said that today's Tokyo evening newspapers are shocked and extremely pessimistic about the future of the Washington talks due to Hull's remarks. The headline of the Nichi Nichi Shimbun is "Hull Criticizes Japanese National Policy, Reveals U.S.'s Lack of Sincerity in U.S.-Japan Talks." The Asahi Shimbun's headline is "The U.S. Attempts to Shirk Responsibility."</p>
<h3>Thailand Holds Cabinet Meeting to Review Far Eastern Situation; Country May Be Subject to Surprise Attack; Thai-Vietnamese Economic Negotiations Continue</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 4th: The Thai cabinet held its weekly meeting yesterday, and all aspects of the Far Eastern situation were reviewed. Last night, a Thai official radio commentator said that Thailand is at a critical juncture, which clearly indicates the Thai government's deep anxiety about the current situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: According to an Asahi Shimbun correspondent in Bangkok, the Thai cabinet met yesterday to discuss Thai-Japanese economic relations and Thailand's position in the current international tense situation. The Thai government has decided to offer 700 million Thai baht to buy the British and American cigarette factories in Bangkok and the tobacco plantations in northern Thailand. It is widely regarded that the Thai government's move is quite significant.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, The highest degree of tension still exists. There are still many who believe that Vietnam can find a solution to the current difficulties and avoid war, but the possibility of a sudden change in Thailand is still the current danger. Although there have often been indications that the Japanese military command will take dangerous initiatives, qualified sources still say that the Japanese troops currently stationed in Vietnam are not sufficient to launch a large-scale offensive, but it is very possible to choose a weak point and launch a blitzkrieg against Thailand.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: A Japanese correspondent in Hanoi reports that Vietnam is gradually realizing that its economy must be combined with Japan's economy, because its trade with Britain, the U.S., and other countries has now completely stopped. The economic negotiations between Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa and Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux are making progress, and it is expected that Vietnam will accept the Japanese proposal to produce rubber and other raw materials in Vietnam. Local officials from all over Vietnam will attend the Hanoi conference tomorrow, and it is now believed that they will support the Governor-General's policy of cooperation with Japan.</p>
<p>Saigon Radio Reports Japan Will No Longer Increase Troops</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 4th: Saigon Radio broadcast a report last night saying that Japan has guaranteed that it will no longer send troops to Vietnam, and that Japan will not use French territories as bases for invading Thailand or Burma. It also said that the guarantee was conveyed by the Japanese ambassador in Hanoi to Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Vichy, 3rd: A certain Japanese news agency issued a message on the 2nd of this month, saying that a French government spokesperson had stated that the future attitude of French Vietnam should be determined by the Pacific War. Government officials have now corrected this, briefly stating that the French government's current policy has been officially declared and explained by the government on the 1st of this month. The statement stated that France is determined to defend Vietnam against possible aggression from any party. This policy has not changed. As for what attitude France will take when Japan uses the troops stationed in Vietnam to attack Thailand, it is considered that there is no such possibility at all. Even the Prime Minister of Thailand himself declared on November 27 that the Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam have no intention of launching an attack on Thailand or Malaya. In short, even if this issue arises, it should be considered within the scope of French interests.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: Kuriyama of the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi arrived in Fukuoka yesterday. It is said that Vietnam is now taking a calm attitude towards the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. Since Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa arrived in Hanoi, the Vietnamese officials' understanding of Japan's position in Southeast Asia and the public's sentiment towards Japan have greatly improved.</p>
<p>East Asian Newspapers Continuously Publish Threats to Thailand and Vietnam</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th: Japanese battleships last night and this morning denounced England and the United States for "taking aggressive labor in East Asia". At the same time, they denounced Thailand's attitude towards Japan, Vietnam's insincerity and non-cooperation. It was solemnly stated that if Thailand does not accept Japan's request for economic cooperation and joining the co-prosperity sphere, the situation surrounding Thailand will become increasingly tense. At the same time, the Thai Embassy declared that the rumor that Thailand is sending a military representative to consult with the British military commander in Malaya is "completely false." Since Mr. Kuriyama, the Chief Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi, returned due to important talks, newspaper commentaries involving Vietnam have increased daily. The newspapers stated that Mr. Kuriyama's talks with Japanese officials would include: 1. Vietnam is said to be gradually lacking sincerity towards Japan. 2. Vietnam is not strong enough to maintain order and law, as can be seen from the bombing of the U.S. Consulate in Saigon. 3. Since it is rumored that Britain is about to invade Thailand, just like the invasion of Iran, the threat to Vietnam is increasing. The newspapers stated that due to the seven factors mentioned above, Japan may have to provide additional assistance to Vietnam in order to maintain peace and security. "Yomiuri Shimbun" commentator Hosokawa said that although Japan has guaranteed the integrity of French rule in Vietnam, the French are showing their lack of sincerity and constantly obstructing the relationship between the Japanese and the Annamese. Therefore, Japan must adopt "a more active policy" because the construction of the "co-prosperity sphere" must be achieved by cooperating with the natives who have blood ties. "Nippon Hiroki Jibo" said, "The actions of England and the United States to show force in the Far East at this time are intended to give Japan a deep impression, but Japan has expressed that its strength and goals in the Far East will hardly be shaken." The newspapers also denounced that the mines laid by Britain near Singapore are floating mines, which is a violation of international law, and may damage Japanese ships like the recent floating mines of the Soviet Union. This morning's editorial of "Nippon Hiroki Jibo" predicted that the Allied forces will soon occupy Thailand. The newspaper recalled that Thailand and Japan signed a treaty in 1606, in which Thailand guaranteed neutrality to Japan and promised to exchange information with Japan. Therefore, Thailand should now notify Japan about "the tricks and conspiracies of third countries." The newspaper said that Japan "must protect" its economic rights obtained from the friendship treaty signed with Thailand in 1940.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Holds Economic Conference; Japanese Foreign Minister Delivers Opening Speech, Saying East Asian Situation Is Serious</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: The East Asia Economic Conference opened here this morning, lasting for three days. More than 400 people attended, including senior government officials, financiers, and industrialists. Foreign Minister Togo delivered a short opening speech, briefly stating that England, the United States, and other countries have not understood the doctrines practiced by Japan in the Far East and have hindered Japan in building a new order in East Asia. The purpose of this move by Japan is to obtain lasting peace and prosperity for all parties. Recent international developments are becoming increasingly serious, and East Asia is currently facing an unprecedented crisis.</p>
<h3>U.S. Builds 343 New Ships</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th: According to a report announced yesterday by Secretary of the Navy Knox, the United States has built 343 warships as of December 1 in its effort to rush construction of a two-ocean navy. The report also said that the newly built cargo ship Sea Otter has completed its final trial run on Tuesday, the 3rd, and will soon enter service. Knox told reporters yesterday that Japan knows how to keep secrets, especially naval secrets. When asked about the comparison of the tonnage of Japanese ships and the strength of the U.S. fleet, Knox replied slowly, "I myself do not know. The Japanese are good at keeping secrets about this information." A high-ranking naval official interjected from the side, "Of course, we know a little." Knox smiled at this remark.</p>
<h3>Domei News Agency Predicts Major Change in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th: The date that Japan expects for the "worst major change" to the United States may become a reality. Today, the Domei News Agency has made its first indication. The scheduled date is mid-December. Domei News Agency said that the Central Cooperation Council of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is scheduled to begin on December 8 for a period of five days. Once the worst major change occurs, it will be shortened to three days. This means that if the "worst major change" occurs, the time may be after December 11. The agency said that this meeting will spend a full day exploring wartime issues to discuss the emergency situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: Today's editorial in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the actions recently taken by the ABCD countries to mobilize in the South Pacific are obviously orchestrated by the United States. If the United States truly wants peace in the Pacific, this move is incomprehensible. The Asahi Shimbun said, after carefully examining the report that Welles, under the order of President Roosevelt, invited Nomura and Kurusu to a meeting, it feels that President Roosevelt is now personally in charge of the U.S.-Japan talks. Therefore, there will soon be a quick decision. Japanese newspapers did not mention the nature of the questions asked by the U.S. President.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th: The "Dokutsu Shimbun" said that unless the United States changes its economic demands that disregard the real situation in the Far East, no matter what President Roosevelt wants to know from the seventh talks in Washington, it will be impossible to overcome the difficulties. The newspaper said, "We demand that the United States abandon its common position. We cannot continue to take a passive bystander attitude towards the war that England and the United States are about to launch in East Asia, nor are we shocked by the actions of the United States."</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Thomas Says Japan Will Eventually Break Away from the Axis; China Believes Far Eastern Situation Is Easing</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 4th: Utah Democratic Senator Thomas said last night that Japan will eventually be willing to sever its ties with the Axis and cooperate with peaceful countries that have interests in the Pacific region. He declared, "Japan's ties are there, not elsewhere. Its ties with the Axis are unnatural and will eventually be destroyed. Its current natural interests in the central position... it is prepared to be welcomed by all countries, including China, and based on equality and peaceful efforts." He also said, "It will eventually come back." The veteran Democrat said that in his opinion, the interdependence of the Pacific countries leads New Zealand, Australia, and Canada to the "practical development of the principles of our country's and the American countries' consolidation treaty." Thomas finally said, "England and the United States are cooperating with the Netherlands, China, and the Soviet Union, so the Pacific has been surrounded by countries that hope for and plan for peaceful trade."</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Chongqing, 3rd: After it became clear that Japan had decided to continue talks with the U.S. with the aim of delaying time, it is generally believed here that the tension of the imminent outbreak of the Pacific War has greatly eased. The Ta Kung Pao said that Kurusu and Nomura's meeting with Hull again must have received instructions from Tokyo to delay the question of time. However, whether England and the United States are willing to listen to their delays and give them favorable time to choose the timing of the war is important.</p>
<p>Singapore Observes That Japan Has Begun to Take a Defensive Stance</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 4th: According to the phenomenon, Japan has begun to take a defensive stance in the Far East. For example, most of the fighter planes and reconnaissance planes have recently been transferred to the Pacific Islands under administration, and defensive fortifications have been built in the Japanese military bases in Vietnam, with anti-aircraft guns installed. Japan has always accumulated materials in order to be able to go out for use as soon as an order is received, but now it must be emptied for some of it. However, Japan's use of this material for overseas defense cannot be regarded as abandoning its aggressive intentions. This may only be a natural precaution plan, but it is enough to see that Japan attaches great importance to the possibility of active resistance from the ABCD powers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 4th: All sectors of the Chinese community here welcome the arrival of the British fleet in Singapore. An editorial in the Ta Kung Pao said that the arrival of Prince of Wales in the Far East will greatly shock Tokyo. Britain has won an important victory in the current war of nerves.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: After 24 hours of silence on the arrival of the British fleet in Singapore, the Tokyo radio station suddenly commented on this matter in various languages last night. The general idea is that England cannot win out many ships from the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, so Japan does not need to panic. However, the appearance of panic cannot be concealed. Its commentators said that the arrival of the British Navy in the Far East must be closely watched, especially because the Gibraltar of the East will probably be used jointly by England and the United States. This is another reason why Japan should strengthen its iron will to pay the overall situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 4th: Although Dutch observers here believe that the British fleet that recently arrived in Singapore has given the navies of the Pacific ABCD powers an advantage, they still believe that there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution to the current crisis. The Dutch East Indies government's attitude of vigilance has not relaxed. Military circles here are now closely watching developments in Washington. A semi-official opinion is that Japan's reply to the U.S. President's question about the reason for stationing troops in Vietnam may not satisfy the U.S. President, because Japan's intention to increase its military strength in Vietnam exists, and all observers in the South Pacific are well aware of this.</p>

<h3>President's Message of Profound Significance; U.S. Lend-Lease Act Applies to Turkey; House Appropriations Committee Approves National Defense Supplementary Funds; Marshall Urges Passage of Philippine Army Budget</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th: Last night's official message stated that the President has announced that he believes that Turkey's defense is closely related, and has instructed that Turkey's needs be supplied as soon as possible. White House officials are unwilling to comment on this brief message. Observers said that the White House issued this message at a time when there is no war raging, but the European situation points out that Turkey is the most important route to the oilfields of the Near East. It is of profound significance to send Bullitt as its special envoy to the Near East to investigate the needs of the British army in the Near East, while announcing that the Lend-Lease Act applies to Turkey. It is not yet known what kind of supplies can be transported to Turkey. Whether Turkey has sought assistance and whether negotiations have taken place between the U.S. and Turkey, officials have not yet made a statement. According to authoritative sources, supplies under the Lend-Lease Act have long been transferred to Turkey through England, but each time items are transferred to Turkey through England, they must be approved by the President. It is said that the main items obtained by the Turkish army are howitzer vehicles. According to Washington sources, the future supplies to be provided by the United States will include artillery, tanks, and other equipment.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th: After President Roosevelt announced that Turkey would be eligible for treatment under the Lend-Lease Act, well-informed sources here said that Turkey has almost made a guarantee to the United States that it will resist German aggression if it receives assistance.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Washington, 4th: Political figures say that President Roosevelt's decision to assist Turkey under the Democratic Country Assistance Act is a sign of new developments in the Near East and another victory for American diplomacy. It is noted that the five countries that enjoy the rights of the Democratic Country Assistance Act are England, China, Greece, the Soviet Union, and Poland. Turkey is the sixth country.</p>

<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 4th: Local newspapers reported today that the German Foreign Ministry has received a report stating that Turkey is also included in the beneficiaries under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act.

<h3>All Sectors of Hong Kong's Military and Civilians are Extremely Calm</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - All sectors of Hong Kong's military and civilians are maintaining a calm and prepared atmosphere. If the situation in Hong Kong can be regarded as a barometer of the response to the Pacific crisis, then the morale of the democratic groups in the Far East is undoubtedly very strong. The Hong Kong government issued evacuation recommendations on the night of the 1st, but there was no panic among the citizens. The government announced in a notice that the authorities would prepare a ship to evacuate people who voluntarily leave Hong Kong, but it has been learned today that there were too few bookings for cabins on the ship, so the previous proposal has been temporarily cancelled and the ship will not sail. Hong Kong is now taking various precautionary measures in a calm and quiet atmosphere, such as "small-scale" deployments of troops to guard the New Territories and Hong Kong's defense positions, and the establishment of several more agencies from the 7th to recruit heads of defense corps. Chinese newspapers here, such as Ta Kung Pao, National Daily, and Sing Tao Daily, have notified the government that if war breaks out, they will continue to publish as usual. (3rd Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Churchill's Warning</h3>
<p>According to a United Press report from London, on the 2nd of this month, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons, issuing two warnings: The war is about to spread to the East; Hitler will mobilize troops westward at any time to attack Britain. Churchill's words were spoken during a debate on the "Expanding Mobilization of the British People" bill, and of course contained the intention of encouraging the British people; but at the same time, it was by no means an exaggeration, but a correct judgment based on objective facts and aimed at the current overall situation. Therefore, the two warnings raised by Churchill should not only be paid special attention to by the British people, but also have world importance.</p>
<p>Churchill's statement that the war is about to spread to the East of course refers to the Pacific. In recent days, the urgency of the Far Eastern situation has been widely recognized. The British preparations for this can be said to have never been relaxed. This week, a powerful fleet including the Prince of Wales will be deployed to Singapore, which is equivalent to announcing that Britain will take action against Japan and will no longer make useless empty statements. The urgency of the Far Eastern situation can be easily measured from this. At present, the only hope is pinned on the US-Japan talks in Washington. The US-Japan talks, after encountering difficulties on the 26th of last month, have not reached a final breakdown due to the fact that Kurosawa and Nomura visited Hull and Welles on the 1st and 2nd of this month, but the atmosphere of these two meetings was significantly different from before. In the past, there were probably some consultations, discussions, or exchanges of views, but in these two recent meetings, the Japanese side was clearly at a loss for words. As Nomura said, when they met, "Mr. Welles spoke eloquently, while we listened silently." Japan has postponed replying to Hull's memorandum, which stated the basic position of the United States, and there is no sign of improvement in Tokyo's attitude towards the United States; however, Kurosawa is still staying in Washington and has no intention of returning. This intention cannot but be interpreted as a delaying tactic. Once the purpose of delay is achieved, Japan will disregard everything.</p>
<p>Japan's repeated delays to the United States are mainly for two purposes: First, Japan still has to carry out some deployments in the Indochina Peninsula and the Pacific, such as military preparations in Vietnam and other places, and the psychological warfare against Thailand, all of which require considerable time to complete. Second, and more importantly, Japan probably has high expectations for Germany in the West: and in order to encourage Japan to move south rapidly, so as to cause trouble for Britain and the United States in the East, Germany will definitely respond to Japan's expectations and make some expressions. One of the most likely actions is to attack Britain.</p>
<p>In this European war, Germany has made some miscalculations about Britain: When German troops invaded Poland in September of the previous year, they believed that Britain would not participate in the war because of this, but as a result, Britain did participate in the war. After France was defeated in June of last year, Germany believed that Britain was no longer worthy of attention, so they changed their strategy to conquer Southeastern Europe with all their strength. As a result, Britain gained sufficient time to strengthen its military power, while Germany, due to its active promotion of the eastward policy, had an unavoidable major conflict with the Soviet Union, which eventually led to the outbreak of the German-Soviet War. On the eve of the imminent outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the Germans still believed that Britain could negotiate peace with Germany and form an anti-Soviet crusade, and even sent Hess to fly to Britain to attempt something, but the result was a complete failure. Not only did Britain and the Soviet Union form a military alliance, but the United States also became closely integrated with the Soviet Union through Britain. Germany also made miscalculations about Britain's production capacity and military power. Germany believed that the activities of the air force and submarines could destroy the industry and foreign transportation of the British Isles; but as a result, Britain was not only able to repel the attacks of German aircraft and clear the sea lanes, but also, with the assistance of the United States, produced a large number of aircraft and tanks, which, in addition to supplying its own needs, were continuously imported into the Soviet Union to attack the German troops who invaded the East.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the German-Soviet War is about to be half a year old, and the German blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union has completely failed, Britain is becoming increasingly powerful. Germany must increase its fear of this maritime lion in its rear and must quickly seek to deal with it with all its strength. Previously, Germany's ambition was to open up the Caucasus and the Iranian Plateau, invade India, and complete the military coordination with Japan, the axis country in the East; but this ambition has recently been shattered by the Soviet Union's great victory in the Battle of Rostov. All of this has made Germany have to change its course and seek new ways to open up. For example, Hitler's representative Goering met with French President Pétain on the 1st of this month, and it is widely rumored that he asked France to hand over the fleet, which may be a preparation for attacking Britain and containing the United States. And this new action is exactly what Japan is waiting for.</p>
<p>But how much attacking power does Germany still have now? Can the German army overcome the dangers of the English Channel? Or can Germany strike Britain through other means? All of this is still in question. Japan, with its arrow on the string, can hardly wait for a long time; or even if Japan intends to delay in order to wait for the launch of Germany's new offensive, the United States will never be easily fooled and allowed. Therefore, in the two warnings raised by Churchill, the outbreak of the Pacific War may be earlier than the expansion of the Western European war; but in any case, between the two, just like when the copper mountain in the west collapses, the bronze bell in the east responds, they are closely related and cannot be separated.</p>
<h3>Southern Route Red Army Swiftly Advances Flanking, German Army Already in General Retreat, Slight German Progress in the Klin Area, Fierce Fighting in the Mozhaisk Area</h3>
<p>Reuters, Kubyshev, 4th – It is reported that the German army is in general retreat along the line from Taganrog to Mariupol. Soviet forces, advancing swiftly northward to flank the German army, are reported to have caught up with the vanguard of the retreating German forces. The slower-moving enemy units have been cut off. Several Italian divisions, previously deployed to support the German retreat, are also reported to be retreating. Even if many enemy soldiers escape, the Soviet army has achieved a great victory in terms of captured war materiel, especially vehicles and tanks. Restoration work in Rostov is now underway. Electricity, telecommunications, and telephone services are being restored. Thousands of residents are helping to clear everything up. It is also reported that two villages near Tikhvin, 100 miles from Leningrad, have been recaptured by Soviet forces, with 5,000 German soldiers killed. The Soviets also destroyed 32 enemy tanks and 353 vehicles. The German attempt to capture Leningrad has now failed, and German operations have been halted. Recent news from Moscow indicates that German tank expert Guderian has not abandoned his intention to attack Kashira from Stalinogorsk in the north. He is deploying new troops to try again. However, after Soviet forces stopped the German 17th Tank Division, etc., their vanguard cavalry is continuing to advance swiftly. The German army initially hoped to pause after retreating, but due to the relentless pursuit by Soviet forces, they continue to retreat. The Soviet side claims to have recaptured seven more villages and towns. Fierce fighting continues in other areas of the Tula front. German forces in the northwest of Tula are still very strong.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – According to official sources in Kubyshev, fighting west of Moscow remains as fierce as before. German forces on the southeastern front retreated in disarray on Wednesday and are now withdrawing from Taganrog, 50 miles west of Rostov. TASS news agency reports from the southern front that General Kleist's forces have been routed and are retreating. Only four rear-guard infantry units, supported by tanks, are putting up some resistance. Soviet forces are pursuing vigorously. It is known that two Italian divisions have arrived on the southern front, but some have already begun to surrender. A large number of enemy tanks, artillery, and trucks have been captured by the Soviet vanguard. The weather is becoming increasingly cold, exacerbating the difficulties for the German army. Many German soldiers have been found frozen to death. According to reports from Turkey, the German side is now redeploying troops from the Crimean Peninsula to try to halt the advance of Timoshenko's Soviet forces. Patrols are reportedly clashing in other areas of the southern front. The German side is erecting road signs along the route of their retreating troops, with the inscription "To Mariupol." One Soviet unit has recovered ten villages. Another Soviet unit destroyed several trucks carrying infantry, capturing a large amount of ammunition and 21 artillery pieces. Meanwhile, on the Moscow front, the German side is deploying large forces to the Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, and Maloyaroslavets areas for combat. Soviet sources admit that the German army has made some progress and say that the situation is tense and serious, especially in the Volokolamsk area. In the Mozhaisk area, two German infantry divisions are engaged in combat between two rivers, and the fighting is extremely fierce. Last night's Soviet communique only stated that Soviet forces were engaged in combat with the enemy along the entire front. On Tuesday, 55 German aircraft were destroyed, and 17 Soviet aircraft were lost. A supplementary announcement stated that on Tuesday, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 154 German tanks, 1,114 trucks carrying troops and supplies, 50 field artillery and anti-aircraft guns, and 254 armored vehicles.</p>
<p>German Troops Driven Back 15 Miles in the Kalinin Area</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 3rd – According to reports from the Soviet front, elite Red Army units are being continuously deployed to reinforce key positions in the Moscow area. German claims of having penetrated a "new area" apparently refer to the southeast of Klin. However, the Soviet radio announced that German troops have been driven back 15 miles to their original positions in the Kalinin area. Fighting on the northern front has also been very active in recent days. The Red Army has repeatedly broken through from the Leningrad area and now seems to be launching a large-scale counter-offensive with combined infantry and artillery. Military observers point out that since Lake Ladoga froze, the defenders of Leningrad are no longer isolated. The Red Army is now using the lake to re-establish contact with enemy forces north of Tikhvin and in the Volkhovstroy lake dam area. The battle for Tikhvin between the German and Soviet armies is very fierce. German forces occupied it on the 10th of last month, and by the end of the month, the Red Army had almost encircled it. Subsequently, the Red Army changed its direction of attack and advanced towards the railway line between Volkhovstroy and Tikhvin. The railway has not been occupied by the German army. The fighting there is now unprecedentedly fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. The Red Army seems determined to sacrifice a huge number of soldiers and equipment to recapture this position in order to alleviate the threat to the Leningrad-Vologda railway and strengthen the forces defending Leningrad. In addition, a Soviet convoy, protected by warships, sailed from the Gulf of Finland to the Hanko Peninsula yesterday for the first time. This move seems to be aimed at withdrawing all or part of the forces from the Finnish bases, as these bases are not suitable for winter warfare. As for the other areas on the Finnish front, the positions have not changed. There has only been sporadic artillery fire, aerial bombardment, and reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Germans Launch Blitz Offensive on the Tula Front</p>
<p>United Press, London, 4th – Moscow Radio reported that the German army has concentrated most of its forces on the Moscow front and launched a large-scale blitzkrieg on Tula. Strong Nazi troops are attacking the Tula Soviet defense lines day and night in an attempt to break into Moscow. The German forces attacking Tula are receiving reinforcements almost every hour. As the German army tries to break into the city, artillery is also unleashing a fierce barrage on the city, causing heavy damage. However, Soviet forces are holding firm. Soviet artillery has silenced some German guns, and the Soviet defenders have not yielded an inch under the frenzied Nazi attacks. In another area of the Tula front, Soviet forces are consolidating some of the positions they captured during yesterday's offensive.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces in North Africa Still Trying to Resist, Germans Using Tank Units to Attack British Forces, Axis Powers Only Hold a Small Desert Area</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – According to the latest news received in London last night, the fighting in Libya is temporarily paused. The attacking British forces, after two weeks of fierce fighting and significant advances, now need to rest in order to inspect their tanks and reorganize their troops. The British deployment has been disrupted by mobile warfare in the desert. The current enemy deployment is roughly as follows: The enemy forces between Sollum and Omar have had many of their strong outposts destroyed, and the remaining coastal enemy defenses have been isolated. The enemy has lost its forward supply bases. Southeast of Tobruk, there are remnants of Axis armored forces. Southwest and west of Tobruk, there are still large Axis forces. The British garrison in Tobruk launched a突击向东南, breaking through the Axis encirclement and protruding out, temporarily linking up with the British forces advancing from the southeast, but the link is not secure. There seems to be a gap between the Tobruk salient and the British forces to the south. The fighting has not ended, but the British army has a good chance of success with the help of the Royal Air Force, which has air superiority in the area.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 4th – German General Rommel in North Africa shows no signs of intending to retreat west through the gap at Tobruk. It is expected that there will be very fierce fighting, with tanks at the forefront, in the coming days. The leading British units are now focused on destroying the main tank strength of the German army. Rommel is determined to use his still numerous tanks to disrupt the positions occupied by British forces along the road between Tobruk and Sollum. A brigade of British armored troops has completed one of the greatest mobile feats in military history. For two weeks, these British troops fought during the day and continued to advance rapidly at night, covering about 1,000 miles.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – Heavy rain has hampered the movement of mechanized units on both sides, so the Al-Raziq area, the main battlefield in Libya, has now temporarily fallen silent. However, British reconnaissance units are still near the border, systematically clearing up the resistance of scattered Axis forces. Enemy lines of communication are constantly under threat of being cut off, as British armored units and the Air Force are ready to attack anytime, anywhere. The main force of the British Eighth Army has established a strong new line from the Egyptian border to the area of ​​Gobi, 35 miles south of Tobruk. All scattered units are being withdrawn to this solid front line. The next stage of the campaign will be launched from this location. General Cunningham has ended the "wheel" battle of the past two weeks with this strategic shift. The Axis forces under General Rommel now only hold a sandy area 35 miles deep and 60 miles long. There are three reasons for the current pause in the fighting: reorganization and replenishment, troop fatigue, and bad weather.</p>
<h3>Stalin Receives Polish Prime Minister, Talks Last Two Hours</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th – On the night of the 3rd, Soviet Defense Committee Chairman Stalin received Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Sikorski at the Kremlin. Soviet People's Commissar Molotov and the Commander-in-Chief of Polish forces in the Soviet Union were also present. The talks lasted for two hours.</p>
<p>Reuters, Kubyshev, 4th – Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Sikorski arrived here from the Middle East yesterday and has met with Soviet Supreme Soviet Chairman Kalinin and Deputy Foreign Commissar Vyshinsky.

He had visited Polish troops in Tobruk and was pleased to learn of the success of Polish submarines in the Mediterranean. He believes that the Allies will win a great victory in Libya because British Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck already knows everything about German General Rommel's actions. He concluded by saying that he had come to the Soviet Union seeking practical results and had great confidence in the Polish forces being formed in the Soviet Union. The Polish forces are currently equipped with Soviet weapons, but the British Prime Minister and the US President will provide the equipment needed in the future.</p>

<h3>Neutral Cargo Ships Maintain Overseas Transport Lines, All British Merchant Ships Cease Operations After Departure, Huangpu Riverbank Suddenly Appears Desolate, Jardine Matheson Manager Responsible for Cargo Transportation on Panama Ships</h3>
<p>After the suspension of British and American ships on the Far East route, traffic between this city and overseas is only barely maintained by a small number of French ships, etc. The Moller ships of British firm Messrs. Ready, the small oil tankers of Asiatic Petroleum Company, and the small oil tankers of Socony Mobil are also preparing to sail south one after another. The two Moller ships, Ready Moller and Maric Moller, are scheduled to leave for Hong Kong today. The three shallow-draft ships of Butterfield &amp; Swire, which were berthed at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong, were moved to the Puxi Wharf on the afternoon of the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Desolate Scene Along the Huangpu Riverbank</p>
<p>The Glen Line steamer, "Guzsils Sistreks," was moved from Pudong to No. 2 Wharf in Puxi on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, and yesterday morning, it was suddenly moved to No. 4 Wharf, alongside the "Jintang" and "Suiding." More than ten iron cargo barges and four small steam launches, which were moored in Pudong, were also moved to the Jardine Matheson Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession yesterday morning. Recalling the Bund area from Rue du Consulat to Shiliupu, the wharves have always been connected end to end with ships, loading and unloading cargo, and the workers were extremely busy. The reporter visited the area yesterday and found that the Butterfield &amp; Swire wharves only had three shallow-draft ships and more than ten iron barges moored there. The Roosevelt Wharf was exceptionally quiet. Standing on the wharf at Xinkaihe, one could see directly to the Xinjiangtian Wharf at Shiliupu. Only many wooden-hulled barges were moored idle along the wharf. More than a thousand cases of Jardine Matheson beer, which were intended to be exported on the Yuesheng, were still piled up next to the wharves along the shore. It is said that they will be moved soon.</p>
<p>Panama Ships Responsible for Cargo Transportation</p>
<p>It is also confirmed that a Panama ship, the S.S. Morazan, will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this afternoon and will moor at the Roosevelt Wharf. It will load 27,700 bags of foreign rice, which belong to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). Another ship, the S.S. Boyata, is carrying coal from Nanyang to Shanghai and will arrive at port in the coming days. It is scheduled to moor at the Qichang Zhan in Pudong to unload. Both Panama ships are managed by the Foreign Shipping Department of Jardine Matheson. It is rumored that the Morazan is preparing to operate regularly between Shanghai and Rangoon, specializing in carrying foreign rice for the SMC. The company also intends to have the two Panama ships call at Hong Kong, so that they can load goods from Hong Kong. This is currently being planned and whether it can be implemented will be decided after the two ships arrive in Shanghai. The Sino-Japanese liaison line is operating as usual. The Shanghai Maru entered port around noon yesterday and is scheduled to return to Kobe from Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>French and Portuguese Ships Suddenly Busy</p>
<p>After American liners and British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire ships were ordered to cease operations in Shanghai and await government dispatch, Shanghai's shipping industry suffered a serious crisis, and industrial and commercial development was also threatened. However, according to shipping circles yesterday, Shanghai's sea transport is not yet in a desperate situation, because the French Mail Company's ships, such as the General Joffre, the Grand D'Artagnan, and the Gange, and other Panama merchant ships, as well as the French Mail ships, are operating to the Philippines and Vietnam. Panama ships are operating to Hong Kong, and Portuguese ships, such as the Paloto, are specially carrying coal from Hongji to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Continue to Operate</p>
<p>Due to the sudden shipping measures, it was rumored that the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire shipping companies would cease operations. However, according to reporters from the company yesterday, although the ships belonging to the company have been ordered to cease operations and concentrate in Hong Kong for dispatch, the Shanghai office will continue to operate and the Chinese and foreign staff will not be dismissed. It was found that after the two companies were ordered to concentrate their ships in Hong Kong, the ships that had come from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and then diverted, included Butterfield &amp; Swire's Qiongzhou, Guiyang, Chengdu, and Jiaying, and Jardine Matheson's Yuesheng, Fusheng, and Guisheng. The ships at the North China ports, such as the Xin Beijing and Ganzhou, accelerated directly to Hong Kong. The Rikuyo Maru, which sailed north from Shanghai on the 2nd, has also been taken to Hong Kong along with the cargo.</p>
<p>Japan Mail Cancels Three Lines</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) received a telegram from the head office on the 3rd, stating that it had ordered the Manila, New York, and Canadian branches to withdraw immediately. It is rumored that the above three lines are all major routes of NYK. There were originally three 8,000-ton class ships between Japan and Canada each month, one 10,000-ton class ship between Manila and Australia each month, and two 17,000-ton class ships between Japan and 香山 each month. Two new 8,000-ton class ships operated between Japan and New York each month. After the order to withdraw, each of the three branches will retain two or three staff members to handle all unfinished matters. Two ships currently sailing in the Honolulu, Singapore, and South American routes have also decided to withdraw.</p>
<h3>Rice Stored in Godowns Outside the Settlement Will Be Sold Publicly, Although the Shipping Situation is Deteriorating, the Stockpiles of Important Goods are Full</h3>
<p>An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Control Office stated that the SMC hopes to set a price limit for flour in the near future. The Price Control Office is continuing to investigate the amount of rice sold since November 10th, the date of establishment of the office. It will be able to determine the amount of rice needed by the citizens each month within a few days and announce it. The rice in the Public Settlement is not only supplied to the Settlement, but also to the areas outside the Settlement in West Shanghai and Zhabei. It is rumored that there is a large amount of rice stored in godowns outside the Settlement, which will be taken out and sold publicly. The shipping situation in this city is now deteriorating, but according to SMC officials yesterday, there are large stockpiles of rice and other essential goods in this city, sufficient for several months. The SMC is doing its best to obtain ships to carry supplies to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>SMC Considering Establishing a Chinese Necessities Association, Prices of Coal Briquettes Should be Reduced Quickly Through Consultations with Operating Merchants</h3>
<p>Until recently, the various prices announced by the SMC, such as milk and canned food, were mostly not necessities for the daily lives of the Chinese. Therefore, the vast Chinese residents in the Settlement were very confused. The SMC has already paid attention to this issue and is currently considering establishing an association of merchants operating Chinese necessities in order to formulate a price limit for Chinese necessities. The SMC authorities are currently studying the allocation method of the statutory foreign exchange promised to be supplied by the Equalization Fund. Among them, the coal item is allowed to be supplied with foreign exchange. The SMC has now used a portion of this foreign exchange to order a large amount of coal from abroad, so the future market price of coal will definitely fall significantly. The market price of coal briquettes can also be reduced as a result. However, for residents in the Settlement, coal briquettes are the second most essential commodity after rice. The current market price of coal briquettes is too high, and the SMC should reduce it quickly. The evaluation of coal briquettes has not been reduced, and citizens have various reasons for this.</p>
<h3>"E" Police District Organizes Security, 38 Japanese Police Officers Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Police Department, "the date of establishment of the 'E' Police District north of Suzhou Creek has not yet been decided," but it will begin work soon. The detailed method of the organization of the E District police force is currently being discussed by the SMC and the Police Department with the Japanese authorities. There will be many Japanese police officers in the force, and its captain will also be appointed by a Japanese person. According to official sources yesterday morning, 38 new Japanese police officers have departed from Japan and arrived in Shanghai, preparing to join the SMC Police Department as reserve police officers. This move does not indicate that the number of Japanese police officers in the Police Department will increase. They are to fill vacancies when Japanese police officers resign. The new Japanese police officers of the SMC Police Department are currently being recruited and trained in Japan and come to Shanghai from Japan every one or two years to join the Police Department.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Raids Zhujiajiao Town</h3>
<p>According to people from Zhujiajiao Town in Qingpu County, in the deep night of the 27th of last month, a large team of Chinese army suddenly arrived and attacked Zhujiajiao, breaking into the town and disarming all the troops stationed there. At that time, the Japanese army took refuge in the fortresses and bombarded the Chinese army with small cannons, but the Chinese army was not damaged. After completing their mission, they withdrew safely. It was also rumored that when the Chinese army withdrew, they also captured the Japanese officials stationed in the town to collect land taxes, and their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Socony Mobil Kerosene Sales Method</h3>
<p>Socony Mobil Oil Company stated that there is no shortage of kerosene in Shanghai, but in order to maintain existing stocks and prevent hoarding, only 17 retail stores are allowed to sell a limited amount of kerosene to Chinese citizens at a fixed price. The restriction method is that each person can only purchase one yuan, and the kerosene obtained can fill about one beer bottle. This price is cheaper than before the price limit. Foreigners who want to purchase kerosene can apply to the company for an oil allocation certificate and purchase the required kerosene at a nearby service station with the certificate. Chinese merchants who need a large amount of kerosene must apply for an oil allocation certificate in this way. After the company determines the amount of kerosene they needed previously, it will then determine how much to allow them to sell each month.</p>
<h3>Electricity Company Sends Representatives to Hong Kong to Request Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Since the Equalization Fund notified the Shanghai Power Company that it would reduce the supply of foreign exchange for coal by 20%, the company considered this matter to be of great importance. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, it specially sent Deputy Manager Salis to Hong Kong to explain the situation of the company's need for sufficient coal. It is rumored that the reason the Equalization Fund announced the reduction in the supply of foreign exchange to the company was because the SMC had already obtained US$1 million in foreign exchange per month for coal from the fund, which could purchase sufficient coal.</p>
<h3>Two More Stores Have Their Licenses Revoked</h3>
<p>The SMC's Industry and Social Affairs Department is now working closely with the Medical Department to investigate whether retail stores are selling goods at the fixed price. Before taking active action, it will first issue warnings, but there are still some stores that violate the order. As of yesterday, there were already seven stores that had been ordered to suspend operations. Six of them were because the selling price exceeded the price limit, and the remaining one was for mixing inferior rice into the SMC's foreign rice. Two of the stores that had their licenses revoked for three days yesterday were a butcher shop and a food shop. Yesterday afternoon, notices were issued to four retail stores, ordering them to present reasons for objecting to being punished. According to officials, the SMC hopes that the public can provide urgent cooperation and report the names of stores that exceed the price limit to the SMC with the attached documents at any time, so that the SMC can immediately implement its work.</p>
<h3>The Bureau's Willingness to Bear the Financial Responsibility for Accommodating Beggars: The Salvation Army's Entrusted Plan for Beggar Camps Ultimately Not Realized</h3>
<p>During a special meeting held by the Public Works Bureau Board on the afternoon of the previous (3rd) day, the issue of accommodating beggars was discussed. As a result, it was resolved to request the Salvation Army to continue operating the beggar asylum this winter, actively accommodating beggars. The asylum was established in December of last year.</p>
<p>Responsible for Expenses</p>
<p>Regarding the expenses of the asylum, although the Salvation Army hopes to obtain donations from the outside world, the Public Works Bureau is now prepared to bear the financial responsibility for the next few months. As for the plan previously hoped to be jointly implemented by the two concessions and the downtown area to establish a larger beggar district in an area not far from Shanghai, it will not be possible to realize it in time this winter. It is noted that the beggar asylum had not been fully accommodated in recent months due to the initiation of the above plan. Now that the above plan has not materialized, the beggar asylum should actively handle accommodation to achieve full scope.</p>
<p>And Plans to Repatriate</p>
<p>The bureau will also take all possible steps to repatriate the accommodated beggars. Regarding the expenses required for repatriation, it is planned to transfer the remaining funds from the former Refugee Repatriation Committee. The committee was established in 1937 and was dissolved in August of this year. All funds have been transferred to the Public Works Bureau to be used for the beggar asylum's responsibility for this winter. If one party alone handles direct relief efforts, the future is not without danger. Therefore, it is still hoped that people from all walks of life can generously donate to this charitable cause to facilitate its progress.</p>

<h3>British Manufacturers Decide to Implement a One-Shift Office System: Asiatic Petroleum Company First to Advocate</h3>
<p>Asiatic Petroleum Company and other British manufacturers in this city have now decided to only work in the morning to save gasoline. According to the company, the amount of oil that should be saved today is even greater than usual because the current gasoline inventory is very small and the source is unreliable. If companies and factories only work in the morning, employees will only need gasoline for two trips a day instead of four trips a day, which can save a lot. Therefore, Asiatic Petroleum Company has decided to work from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day starting Monday (the 8th).</p>
<h3>Opening a Room at the Cathay Hotel: Robbing a Prostitute</h3>
<p>Gong Yiming Arrested</p>
<p>Gong Yiming and Wang Hanmin, natives of Wuhu, went to Room 521 of the Cathay Hotel at 104 Jing'an Temple Road on the 18th of last month, using the name D. M. Lee and paying 50 dollars. At 9:00 PM, they impersonated Zhu Shunlin and telegraphed Wan Shuangzhu, a prostitute from No. 35 Xinhui Le Lane, Yunnan Road, to come. They forcibly tied Wan's hands and feet, blindfolded her, stuffed her mouth with cotton cloth, placed her in the bathtub, and robbed her of two diamond rings, two jade rings, and a "Love-Near" gold watch, worth over ten thousand yuan, and fled. After reporting the case to the police station, they were ordered to investigate. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, the thief, Gong Yiming, took one of the diamond rings to Lao Baohua Silver Shop at No. 328 Avenue Edward VII to sell it. He was discovered by Chinese Detective Huang Enming of the Route D. 思威 Police Station, who arrested Gong and took him along with the diamond ring to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the case clearly and requested a postponement. According to Wan Shuangzhu's complaint about the robbery and her identification of Gong Yiming as one of the two thieves, Stone Judge verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further verification.</p>
<h3>Boatmen Transporting Cloth: Embezzling and Pawning</h3>
<p>Perpetrators Arrested and Detained</p>
<p>Shen Jianghai of Hengli Transportation Company at No. 469 North Suzhou Road entrusted boatmen Shen Jinpei and others to transport 68 bolts of cloth to Suzhou on the 3rd of last month. Unexpectedly, many days passed without any news. When questioned, they were evasive and demanded 1,400 yuan to return the goods. Shen Jianghai paid the money, but they only returned 15 bolts of cloth, and the rest were missing. Shen reported the case to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Chinese Detective Li Wenbin and Detective Dong Qingquan arrested the suspects Shen Jinpei, Xiao Rongquan, Chen Aliang, Lu Heshang, and Chen Minsheng at the Zhongxing Hotel on Hankou Road. They also went to pawnshops such as Dafeng, Yongda, Anchang, Fengyu, and Decheng to retrieve 52 bolts of cloth, which were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, explained the case.

<h3>Two Young Students Kidnapped at the Entrance of McTyeire School: Two Brothers Kidnapped Along with Their Car in the Morning on Their Way to School</h3>
<p>At 7:50 yesterday morning, a kidnapping case of two Ma brothers, young students, suddenly occurred at the entrance of McTyeire School on Medhurst Road, a cross-border road in the Shanghai Fourth District. A black-plated car with concession license number 1445, in which the two students were riding, disappeared. It is reported that the two young students, Ma Shiwei, 13 years old, and Ma Shizhe, 10 years old, are currently studying in the elementary school department of McTyeire School on Medhurst Road. Every day, the driver, Ren Jinsheng, drives the car to transport the two students. Unexpectedly, at the above time yesterday morning, when the chauffeur drove the car to send the two young masters to school as usual, as the car arrived in front of McTyeire School, three bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. First, they forcibly drove the chauffeur out of the car, and then each bandit jumped in. One of the bandits took on the role of driver and drove towards the Zhaofeng Garden area on Great Western Road and disappeared. The incident was immediately reported to the patrol rooms of the two concessions, ordering all the patrol officers to pay close attention to the car's license number and investigate the kidnappers.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between Color Printing Industry Labor and Management Break Down: Two Representatives Beaten</h3>
<p>Workers in the city's color printing industry went on strike once in May of this year. After wages were generally increased, work was resumed. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of last month, the workers suddenly declared a strike again, demanding increased wages. The employers appointed six representatives: Xia Pengnian (Dahua), Wu Youzhang (Xiesheng), Yang Zhengyong (Dalan), Mao Xiaoqing (Xiangji), Qian Fulin (Meihua), and Shao Zimin (Sida). They contacted the labor representatives several times, willing to increase wages by 30% and provide a uniform rice subsidy of 4.5 dou. However, the labor representatives insisted on a 100% increase and a rice subsidy of 5 dou, resulting in a stalemate. Afterwards, some of the representatives received threatening letters with bullets, which made them feel disheartened. After repeated invitations from the labor representatives, negotiations resumed yesterday morning. As a result of the wide gap in conditions, the negotiations broke down again. Around 11:00 AM, as the representatives were leaving and about to board their cars, dozens of striking workers who had been lying in wait on the side of the road suddenly rushed out and used force. They dragged the representatives out of the cars and beat them with sticks, causing Wu Youzhang and Mao Xiaoqing to be severely injured. The cars were also vandalized. The street police arrived to suppress the violence and arrested three of the attacking workers. After questioning them at the Hongkou Police Station, they were sent to the court for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Broker Arrested for Fraud and Theft</h3>
<p>Shen Jishi, a cotton cloth broker from Taicang, stole a stack receipt with number 774 from the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation on Guangdong Road on the 10th of last month. It was recorded on the receipt that there were five boxes of "Four Gentlemen" from the Neiwai Cotton Mill. Shen immediately sold it to the Ruichang Cotton Cloth Shop on Henan Road for more than 21,000 yuan. The shop then resold the stack receipt to Hualian Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 85 McTyeire Road for 20,370 yuan. On the 19th, when Hualian went to pick up the goods from the Neiwai Cotton Mill, it was discovered that the stack receipt had already been reported lost by the Mitsubishi Corporation. The case was reported to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Detective Feng Xiushan, Shen was arrested, and 8,200 yuan of stolen money was seized. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, prosecuted him for fraud and theft. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Linkun to defend him. After questioning by Judge Dai, the case was postponed for further verification.</p>

<h3>Buddhist Pure Karma Society Distributes Medicine</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Charity Department of the Buddhist Pure Karma Society has received donations of Shaluo medicine water, dysentery powder, and Four News Effective Soup from Mr. Hua, the owner of Pengshoutang, each year in quantities of several thousand pieces, worth several thousand yuan. Most of them have been distributed by Buddhist colleagues to the occupied areas to treat poor patients in remote villages, and they have all been exceptionally effective. They also avoid the trouble of decocting (details in the war imitation), so colleagues such as Wang Dechun, director of the Buddhist Pure Karma Society Chinese Medicine Department, all hold the same good deeds for others, and deeply hope that philanthropists will prepare more and distribute them to the poor and sick.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Basketball Tonight, Act III: Group A Lian Xing Battles Zhong Yi; Group B Hua Nan Faces French Police, Yi Guang Meets Yi Guang</h3>
<p>The current Western Youth Basketball Tournament has already started its second round of matches. Tonight, the third act, is scheduled to begin at 7:15 PM, still at the association's gymnasium. The first two matches are Group B: Yi Guang vs. Yi Guang, Hua Nan vs. French Police. Hua Nan is a strong team in Group B. They defeated Qiang Hua in the handicap basketball tournament, so their strength should not be underestimated. They will surely capture the French Police and achieve a successful start. The Group A headliner is the newly emerging strong team Lian Xing, organized by famous players from Zhong Xi, against Zhong Yi. Recently, in the four-team basketball tournament hosted by Yue Qing Middle School, Lian Xing successively overcame Shanghai's famous strong teams Lan Bai and Paramount. In the final, they defeated Hu Xing to win the championship. Their momentum is unmatched for a time. Team captain Chen Xuechong is agile and brave. Kong Guangyi, Tao Bolinji, Zhou Yaokang, and Qu Xilin are all top players of their time. The lineup is exceptionally complete. Zhong Yi is the champion of Group B, and their strength is also considerable. However, when encountering such a strong team, they will probably be forced to surrender. Tickets are three yuan downstairs and two yuan upstairs. The order of tonight's matches is recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Four Great Iron Armies Will Meet Tomorrow: Three Exciting Small Football Matches Starting at 1:30 PM at the Poor Children's Education Institute</h3>
<p>The Poor Children's Education Institute of this city, in order to raise funds to purchase books for its library, has specially invited the four great iron armies of small football, Rui Tang, Meng Shi, Fudan, and Yi Guang, to participate in friendly inter-league matches. It has also invited the movie stars and Shenqu opera performers to form two teams to participate in performances. The expected grand occasion will be unprecedented. The event is now scheduled to start tomorrow (Saturday), with the time set for 1:30 PM, and the location at the institute's football field on Jiaozhou Road. The program schedule has now been arranged. The overture will be Meng Shi vs. Fu Dan. Meng Shi is known for its powerful attacks. Xiao Ziwen, He Jiatong, Tang Genfu, and other wonderful skills have long been well-known. The roar of the lioness has spread throughout Shanghai. Fudan is the outstanding football team of all the universities in Shanghai, and there are many fierce generals. Sun Fang, Qian Ruilong, and others' experienced skills are enough to compete with Meng Shi. It is still difficult to predict who will win. The next act will be the performance of Shenqu opera and movie stars. Both sides will have pure performers on the field, which will be particularly flavorful. The headliner will be Yi Guang vs. Rui Tang. Rui Tang was originally side by side with the Dragon Team. Since the Dragon Team retired, Rui Tang has implicitly ascended to the top spot. Yi Guang is the incarnation of the Shun Ji team. Shun Ji is the crystallization of Tao Jinrong's years of effort. There are no empty reputations under his name. The bravery of Han Longhai and Zhao Yongfang, and the liveliness of the Tao Tingfu brothers, are enough to compete with Rui Tang. A bloody battle will be full of excitement and will also be a lively embellishment to the long-silent Poor Children's Education Institute football field. Tickets are divided into three types: one yuan, two yuan, and five yuan. Pre-sales have already started today. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Meng Shi — Fudan 1:30 PM</p>

<h3>Gold Fluctuates Unsteadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was still fluctuating unsteadily. It rose first and then fell, causing much confusion. Because the war clouds are gathering in the Far East, it is feared that shipments from Hong Kong will disappear from now on. The Xiang Xing Yong Li Jin gang placed an order for 670 taels. The securities firm placed an order for 530 taels. He Cheng Shun Yuan Xiang He Hui Piao firm Cheng Da De Cheng Jin Wei Yi Hong also placed orders. However, there was a rumor that gold from North Korea was being shipped to Shanghai. A securities firm representing the Tianjin gang vigorously sold 900 taels in the morning (and then bought back 120 taels in the afternoon). Tian Yuan cleared out 1,010 taels throughout the day. Yong Cheng cleared out 830 taels. Therefore, the rising trend was suppressed. The price rose to 15,850 yuan and then retreated. In the afternoon, it reached 14,950 yuan. Finally, the banking gang came in to support it, and the closing price was still up 80 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 25,140 taels.</p>
<p>15,000 Yuan Entered and Exited Again</p>
<p>From the morning, when the market opened at 9:00 AM, each bar (ten taels) rose by 300 yuan, to 15,500 yuan. Xiang He, Tian Yuan, and Yong Cheng came to vigorously sell, and it immediately fell by 300 yuan, to 15,200 yuan. Suddenly, Xiang Xing and Yong, from the Hong Kong gang, came to cover their short positions. Gong He, He Sheng, Ming Feng, Cheng Da, and De Cheng scrambled to buy. Xiang He even bought back aggressively. The price immediately rose sharply by 650 yuan, to 15,850 yuan. However, the securities firms from the Tianjin gang and Yong Cheng Tian Yuan were still dumping huge amounts. Ding Sheng, Heng Ji, De Da, and Shun Yuan were also eager to sell. It immediately fell by 470 yuan, to 15,280 yuan. The noon closing price was 15,300 yuan. When the market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it immediately fell by 200 yuan, to 15,100 yuan, because Yong Cheng was vigorously selling. Securities firms entered and rose to 15,200 yuan. Gong He, Tian Yuan, Hong Qing, Shui Yong Cheng came to compete to sell, and the market retreated to 14,950 yuan. Securities firms came to absorb again. Shun Yuan, Wan Feng, and remittance firms came to support, raising it by 350 yuan, to 15,300 yuan. The closing price at 4:00 PM was 15,280 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan compared to the previous day. The high and low for the whole day was 900 yuan. The retail price of spot gold from cash shops was 15,500 yuan. The purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rose, Silver Fell</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold changed four times a day. Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang initially listed it at 1,630 yuan, and then it fell by 50 yuan, to 1,580 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), an increase of 20 yuan. Silver was listed at a small two yuan, totaling 20 yuan. The black market price was 16 or 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rates, Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. HSBC and other small counters' prices were all flat. The black market exchange rates for the British pound and the US dollar were flat for the British pound and loose for the US dollar. There were no formal market prices, and it all depended on the supply and demand at the time, resulting in unexpected and unpredictable fluctuations. The US dollar originally had a price of 3.375 yuan with a household. A certain Chinese businessman-broker transferred funds at Chase Bank, shouting down to a low price of 3.625 yuan to sell. Import foreign firms that were not allowed to apply did not make any arrangements. However, the buying price for the British pound was low at 3.225 yuan. The future may also have the possibility of long-term release. However, it suddenly turned silent in the afternoon. According to the prices quoted by all parties at 4:00 PM, the British gold price was 3.225 yuan, and the US dollar price was 3.625 yuan. The British pound was flat, and the US dollar was up by 0.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the trend of British and American gold pounds was stable, and the market price stood flat. The British gold ticket also tended to fall. The US gold ticket once rose as high as 30.8 yuan, and the final price was 29.8 yuan, resulting in the same as the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket continued to trend downward. Japanese gold tickets and North Korean tickets, military tickets, etc. all tended to weaken. The former retreated to 2.6 yuan, followed by 2.2 yuan, and the latter was 3.33 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning, and all exchange rates were neither glorious nor disgraced.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London and New York telegraphic transfers remained unchanged. There was a market without a price. Shanghai remittance rose by two yuan, to eighty yuan. The United Banknote black market slightly increased by half a corner, to forty-nine yuan.</p>
<h3>Although the Bulls of Shuang Ma Can Be Closed Out, They Are Ultimately Exhausted by the Factory's Sell-Off</h3>
<p>The yarn market trend is gradually entering a stable state. However, the public's mentality is not optimistic. Therefore, when the market rises, sellers are extremely enthusiastic, and prices cannot rise. The pressure is heavy. However, some parties still adhere to the principle of buying on dips, and the amount purchased is already huge. Because the Shuang Ma market is strong, although there have been sell-offs recently, part of it has already shown the intention of receiving it, because the change of the factory's order is relatively cheap. Therefore, the swap discount is lighter. Today, the bulls are discounted to the sellers by two and a half yuan. In the end, there is also the saying of flat snatching. The highest price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 2,500 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,420 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning. Because the bulls were discounted at the end of the previous day's swap, people's hearts were better, and the first pan rose by 30 yuan, to 2,470 yuan. It hovered at this price for a while. Then, the exchange opened, and the prices of yarn and cloth rose. People's hearts were strong. At the same time, gold was very expensive. Floating short covering, the market gradually moved forward to 2,500 yuan. When the price rose, short selling became active again. The factory slightly sold off, and the situation was more exhausted, closing at 2,410 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 2,150 packages. The market was sluggish when it opened in the afternoon because everyone was pessimistic. The price was 2,435 yuan. Afterwards, it was held at 2,421 yuan to 25 yuan, but the new throwers were also wary. The final closing price was 2,437 yuan, and the off-market price was 40 yuan to 45 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shuang Ma futures market situation changed from strong to sluggish, and the trend did not deviate from the roundabout situation. The development of the situation in all aspects is abrupt. As for the extent to which it will develop, it makes both sides uneasy. The most worrying factor is the contraction of silver, which makes the potential of the bulls weaken. Therefore, the market is brewing. Although it has reversed the previous example and is higher than the spot yarn, it is ultimately presented in a hovering state due to the expectation of people's hearts. When it opened in the morning, it was first because of the re-rise of American cotton, and the gold market and factory orders once made great strides. Therefore, the recent futures yarn was 2502.00, with a slight strong trend, while January turned soft again, opening at 2575.00, and February at 2635.00. After entering, through the absorption of gold shops and securities gangs, it was once pulled up by 20 or 30 yuan, but then it fell back. The fluctuations were small in the afternoon, and it eventually tended to be depressed. The reason for the small return of the exchange was that it affected the general floating short-selling. Therefore, the market price was hovering and uneven, and the prices of the various months were quite inconsistent. As a result, the prices of the various months fell by more than 20 yuan to 50 yuan. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is as calm as ever. Although the factory has no movement, the fine lint cotton is still flat, but the coarse lint is inferior.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is lively and strong. In the early morning, it first rose due to purchases by peers and Wall Street purchases. Afterwards, it continued to rise due to the good and easy sales of cotton cloth and speculative purchases. As a result, the closing price yesterday rose by 32 to 33 pounds each, respectively, compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is closed. It is predicted that the market situation will open today. Due to the solid foothold of American cotton in recent days, it is expected to rise by about eight rupees.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Ultimately Finds It Difficult to Rise; Mercerized Feather Yarn Is Expensively Priced</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was strong in the morning and tired in the afternoon, still hovering, because the situation is strong and people's hearts are uneasy. As a result, the price of white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 0.5 to 1 yuan per bolt, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth fell by 1 to 2 yuan. Transactions in this street were more than 300 pieces of various cloths. Customer sales were as depressed as ever.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Unable to rise, the closing price of the futures market of the exchange's colored ball fine cloth rose by about 0.5 yuan in the morning market, and then fell back by 1 yuan in the afternoon market. The closing price for this month was 85 yuan, a small decrease of 1 yuan compared to the previous day, January 88.01 yuan, a small 0.99 yuan, February 90.03 yuan, a small 0.7 yuan. The current spot leader fine cloth factory order fell by 0.25 yuan, and the evening closing price was 89.75 yuan. The closing situation of the Four Gentlemen's Serge was tired, at 3.265 yuan.</p>
<p>Mercerized Feather Yarn: It has been widely used and sold recently. Tailors of Western-style clothing all have a need for it. The selling price is also extremely expensive. Yesterday, the average price of No. 1 mercerized feather yarn with wax thread end was 8.5 yuan per yard. The selling price of ordinary yarn was 6.5 yuan to 7.5 yuan. The minimum selling price of low-end goods was also 5 yuan. Moreover, there is not much circulating in the market, because the factory's production is reduced by an average of two-thirds compared to the past.</p>
<h3>Internal Debt Buying Is Not Strong; Many Rubber Stocks Pay Dividends; Foreign Merchant Stocks Are Wavering and Falling</h3>
<p>The multi-party on the public debt black market was unable to pull up the market yesterday, so it turned sharply weak. The popularity was originally low. The multi-party then slowly engaged in coming out of the cage. However, because there were few buyers, they could not do what they wanted. The major players have not wavered, and the future is still based on international issues. The market atmosphere in the morning was oversupplied. The opening price of Class C broke the 8-yuan mark. Sheng Xing and Jiu Feng bought, and Lian He and Yi Tai sold. However, the buyers were not very enthusiastic. The market was relatively flat in the afternoon. Heng Kang's selling was very strong. Jiu Feng and Hong Da's buying was still intentional or unintentional. As a result, the market price unanimously returned to a small triangle of 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.12 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory were traded, with a price of 355 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The manager of Huifeng Foreign Company, British Zhahua, and other five Oak Tree Co., Ltd. regularly distributed the interim dividend for 1941. The compilation is as follows:</p>
<p>British Zhahua: Issued on December 17, 2 yuan of national currency per share.</p>
<p>Keluohua: Issued on December 19, 0.15 yuan of national currency per share.</p>
<p>Zhahua Kangsha: Issued on December 19, 0.2 yuan of national currency per share.</p>
<p>Rubber: Issued on December 24, 1.5 yuan of national currency per share.</p>
<p>British Guda District: Issued on December 31, 1.5 yuan of national currency per share.</p>
<p>British Si Hai Insurance Co., Ltd. is scheduled to distribute the interim dividend for 1941 on December 15, with an annual interest rate of 2.5%, paid in Shanghai General Currency.</p>
<p>The public stock market is peaceful and quiet. The opening price was lower than the previous closing price. After opening, it continued to fall. It briefly recovered in the middle, but it softened again at the noon closing. The fluctuations were small in the afternoon, and the potential was also very sluggish.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Is Stable</h3>
<p>Foreign rice stagnated, and the national rice market was without sales, however, peddlers did manage to transport a hundred odd bags of National Rice.</p>
<p>The flour market continued to be fair and stable. Dong Zhan flour, due to the stagnation of the customer gang, still lacked inflows and outflows. Since the Western Zhan registered flour was priced at 40.02 yuan by the Gong Bu Ju and directly distributed to each consumer, trading in the market was even quieter. Yesterday, hundreds of bags of Jin Long flour were traded, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan, selling at 40.05 yuan. Bran was popular due to the shortage of goods. Since the Japanese-owned San Xin successively dumped it, the market has gradually returned to stability. Yesterday, San Xin opened back at 54 yuan, which was also 0.5 yuan less than the previous market. Lan Hua brand customer bran was 52 yuan, which was more than 1 yuan less. However, the wheat stock was about to run out, and it still looked tall and handsome.</p>
<h3>Scattered Hoarding Frequently Unloads; Grains and Edible Oil Fall Back</h3>
<p>The grain market situation yesterday saw a stop to the rise and turned flat, because actual sales have tended to decrease due to high prices, and scattered returns frequently loosened. Therefore, the price of edible oil was suppressed by 3 to 5 yuan. Soybeans were flat, and corn was first high and then tired. The total market transaction was 20 barrels each of Qingdao raw oil and soybean oil, 10 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 dan of Dayou Factory's clear oil, 200 dan of rapeseed oil, 100 barrels of Rihua Factory's rapeseed oil, 100 dan of Lide Factory's rapeseed oil, 300 dan of Yoshida Factory's rapeseed oil, more than 200 packages of Tianjin Xin Jin Yuan, and more than 100 packages of green beans, more than 3,000 packages of spot corn, and 500 tons of futures.</p>
<h3>Sugar Futures Stagnate Invisibly; Scattered Hoarding Seeks to Unload; The Declining Trend Has Not Been Suppressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market suffered because the Lian Ying Company was invisibly stagnant, and the scattered hoarding households urgently sought to unload, and people's hearts were even more weak, causing the market to decline step by step. There were no transactions in futures, and only more than 7,000 packages of spot goods were transacted. For example, the spot price of 24 coarse white for imports in November opened at 191 yuan in the morning and gradually fell to 80.70 yuan. In the afternoon, it still opened at 70 to 67 yuan, and then slightly rebounded to 70 to 77 yuan. As a result, it had to fall by 17.5 yuan compared to the previous market.

<h3>Hong Ji Coal Rises Again—New Goods Arrive One After Another—</h3>
<p>Since the French Public Board issued a notice limiting the price of Hong Shen white coal, the Public Concession is also paying close attention to registering coal storage for reference, and planning the selling price. However, starting yesterday, the industry suddenly stopped issuing orders, causing people's hearts to be agitated, and the black market rose again. However, new goods are arriving one after another. Yesterday, another ship loaded with more than 2,300 tons of Hong Ji lump coal arrived at the port and is being unloaded.</p>

<h3>Robbery, Matchmaking, Trial Marriage</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>Recently, rice has reached 130 (dollars per unit), and a bag of flour is limited to 40 yuan, so there are indeed many people suffering from malnutrition; however, it is said that there are even more young men and women busy getting married. Marriage is inherently very serious, but at this time and place, rushing for "public days" does not seem inappropriate. There is a book as evidence: "Men should have their roles, women should have their homes. People hate to see goods thrown away, but not necessarily to hoard them; they hate to see strength not used, but not necessarily for oneself..." A gentleman helps others achieve good things. Strike the iron while it's hot. A happy marriage, postponed until next year, might be even less economical, so everyone is doing it.</p>
<p>Considering the origins of marriage, since the Duke of Zhou, it seems to have become much more solemn. At present, although it is no longer regarded as a major undertaking, it does not detract from its sacredness. Unless you are an isolated individual, it seems to be necessary. Serious scholars like to quote the "Guan Ju" (Osprey) poem, joyous but not excessive, needless to say. Young lads in America have recently been suggesting "down with matchmakers," advocating a system of open matchmaking through direct negotiation, with matching social status, acting as if it were a serious matter. Progressive revolutionaries, for "comfort in work," although they dislike complicated rituals, and some "opportunistic wavering," are simply fulfilling the obligation of "trial marriage" when cohabitating... Therefore, I think that marriage is not a major undertaking in life, but merely one aspect of personal life, but in the process of family succession, it is called a "means." The choice of this means depends on whether careful consideration has been given beforehand, and whether the burdens of life afterward (spiritual and material) can be met comfortably.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are also those who fall behind or fail in this means. As for the low-grade tastes, as seen by the petty bourgeoisie: a certain Xiao Liu, now because of the high cost of everything, is unable to formally marry, so he invited clan uncles and fellow villagers to wait for his beloved to arrive late. With a shout, she was dragged into the "prepared" car and sped away. Needless to say, it was a "hasty affair." This kind of robbery marriage seems to have been discovered once recently in the foreign concessions, which is quite interesting. Although the custom of robbery marriage has existed since ancient times, there is no need to lament the decline of morals; however, now they actually use cars, which resembles "kidnapping," is it not strange!</p>
<p>After Yuan Zicai entered the Hanlin Academy, he submitted a memorial requesting leave to return home for his wedding, with the beautiful lines "The wind on Penglai Mountain is cold, the long nights are spent studying, the writing brush is adorned with gold and powder, and the robes are disordered in the early morning." This style of "the wedding night in the bridal chamber, the time of hanging the name on the golden list" has also existed since ancient times—this is of course "spiritualist classicism," and there is a huge difference between it and the personality of a certain Xiao Liu, but the subjective demands of a certain Xiao Liu and the self-expression of Yuan Zicai do not seem to be very far apart, the crux lies in the marriage problem, the difference is that the latter is unlearned.</p>
<p>Yuan Zicai's forte lies in "romantic stories," so he exaggerated the "process of union," thinking that this lifelong event was of utmost importance, thereby highlighting his literary talent and complementing each other—he still had a minimal political function, and being of utmost importance merely indicated that the lyricist belonged to a leisurely position. As for whether he can get subsidized rice from the Public Works Bureau after marriage, and limited-price flour, others need not worry: what is sad is that although a certain Xiao Liu has caught the chicken, how will he feed it afterward? (I apologize for still holding a petty bourgeois view here.) Not to mention that renting a car now costs nine yuan for twenty minutes, and the attic's communal kitchen must still be opened, this is called "fooling the people," is it not very sad?</p>
<p>Therefore, the law is nothing more than human sentiment, and the father-in-law does not find his son-in-law particularly interesting. The result of the robbery marriage is reporting to the authorities, "Xiao Liu, is he marriageable? Being in shackles is his crime!" (See the robbery marriage news in this newspaper on the 25th of last month.) Serves him right!</p>
<p>In this day and age, "the serious demands of real life" are a bit alarming. If you have a love interest, you want to blackmail your father—this is a small matter, but the result for wealthy families and bachelors is often no different, "is it not very sad?"</p>
<h3>Insisting on Saving Face Causes Suffering – I'm Treating You to a Wedding Feast</h3>
<p>— Huan Jun</p>
<p>Sitting in a teahouse, I ran into a friend named Wu. After exchanging pleasantries, I heard him say that he was working for a certain foreign company and was very favored by the foreign boss, earning 300 yuan a month, which made me, whose recent situation was difficult, extremely envious.</p>
<p>"Old Huang! I'm treating you to a wedding feast next month," Xiao Wu said with a smile, taking a couple of sips of tea.</p>
<p>What? I knew before that he didn't have a lover, and I never heard any news of an engagement; after not seeing him for half a year, he suddenly got married. How could I not admire Xiao Wu's lightning-fast success? At a time when everything is incredibly expensive and the cost of living is at its peak, he has a large sum of money to settle this lifelong event, which makes this poor fellow even more jealous.</p>
<p>I said, "Xiao Wu! You really have great tricks and a good income. In these extraordinary times, you can comfortably be a groom... It probably costs several thousand to do this thing, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course, less won't do. At the engagement, you need these pieces of jewelry first: a gold bracelet, a platinum watch, two diamond rings, a pair of pearl earrings. Just these four items alone are very costly."</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh!"</p>
<p>"Although the gold bracelet is only 1.2 taels heavy, it costs more than 1,600 yuan, plus 900 yuan for the watch, 1,000 yuan for a pair of diamond rings, and 500 yuan for a pair of pearl earrings, totaling 4,600 yuan."</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh!"</p>
<p>"Also, there's a spring coat and a winter coat, four silk cheongsams, and other tea gifts, which add up to more than 2,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh..."</p>
<p>"In addition, I spent 2,200 yuan to buy furniture for the new house, plus an estimated net expenditure of 600 yuan on the wedding day. Ha! Ha! Although it's not much, doing this one thing costs more than 9,000 yuan." Xiao Wu continued to say, I didn't know if he was boasting about being rich or mocking my poverty.</p>
<p>"More than 9,000 yuan! It takes such a large amount. I didn't realize you were a wealthy friend." Although I was suspicious, I still complimented him a few times.</p>
<p>"Wealthy... Alas! To tell you the truth, it's all borrowed." A layer of melancholy suddenly covered his face.</p>
<p>"Hmm, borrowed! Don't lie, who would believe that?" I shook my head slightly.</p>
<p>"If I didn't borrow, huh! Where would I get this money? Let me tell you, I even paid 2% interest."</p>
<p>"Really! How can this be good? After getting married, one plus one equals two. After having a son, two plus one equals three. In the future, there will be many mouths to feed, and expenses will increase sharply; however, due to paying interest, your income will be reduced by 20% or 30%. Xiao Wu! This life will be difficult. A person is light without debt, can't you try to save money?"</p>
<p>"Save money? Brother, you only know one thing, not the other. Now, in this era, who doesn't care about vanity, who doesn't want to save face? If you plan to save money, you can forget about getting a wife for the rest of your life." Xiao Wu said seriously. This is a matter of course, and an experience in getting a wife, how dare I say he is even half wrong? But how will Xiao Wu get rid of the heavy burden on his body?</p>
<p>Wedding feast! Wedding feast! It is an exchange of debt and interest, a prelude to sorrow and worry; where does the joy come from? What is there to be happy about?</p>
<h3>Hoarders Are Ubiquitous</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River, Intended by Le Shuai, Drawn by Yang</p>
<h3>Buyers Pay Attention - The Issue of Measurement</h3>
<p>— Cheng Qiu</p>
<p>Since the authorities have restricted prices, giving hoarders a serious blow, and recently restricted the prices of general daily necessities to curb the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the authorities' favor is truly substantial.</p>
<p>Previously, the biggest headache for housewives every day was buying groceries. Prices soared, and although various vegetables were displayed in the market, they never knew which one to buy. Buying just a little bit of ordinary vegetables would cost about four or five yuan. If you wanted to eat some fish or meat, ah! That was truly a big deal.</p>
<p>After restricting prices, general vegetables were cheaper. Occasionally, you wanted to buy some meat to eat, and although the price was cheaper, a catty of meat now was far less than a catty of meat before. Some other things were also like this. In terms of measurement, they were always less than before. This was entirely the trickery of merchants. Although ordinary people enjoyed the benefits of the authorities' price restrictions, they were still secretly losing out. For example, with general vegetables, if you used your own scale and the seller's scale, there would be a difference in price.</p>
<p>The price set by the authorities is fixed in terms of measurement, but now there are two different measurements between buyers and sellers, so is it that the buyer's scale is too large and does not comply with the authorities' regulations, or is the store's scale too small? If the store's scale is too small, then it does not comply with the authorities' restrictions and violates the law. Therefore, I hope that in addition to the beneficial policy of restricting prices, the authorities will pay close attention to the measurement of general daily necessities on the market, so that unscrupulous merchants cannot take advantage of loopholes and violate the law, and ordinary people can receive greater and more concrete benefits. Eliminating evil must be thorough, which is probably something the authorities cannot ignore.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The authorities have been paying close attention to unscrupulous merchants using improper measuring instruments in the market; many have been found and severely punished. Hereby, we warn unscrupulous merchants not to be stubborn and continue to test the law, and buyers who are "losing out" should also be more careful themselves. (For goods that are liquid, it is advisable to prepare an extra measuring instrument.)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen. Papa, let's go busking!</p>
<p>"I know what's on your mind," Mei Bao nodded, looking as if she understood her father's plight very well. "Originally, we are unfamiliar with this place, and being a primary school teacher is the best thing, but no one can introduce me; and last time I heard Mr. Qian say that the schools in Shanghai are almost all closed, so this path is basically impassable. As for other things, needless to say, Papa, you are worried, and I myself feel very dangerous. These past few days, I have been planning day and night, and I already have an idea, but I don't know what you think."</p>
<p>"What good idea do you have?" Begonia said looking very puzzled.</p>
<p>Because Mei Bao heard him cough several times in a row while he was speaking, she didn't answer immediately, but first stood up and poured out a bowl of jujube soup that she had cooked in advance, and handed it to her father to drink.</p>
<p>"Papa, can't I still sing opera..."</p>
<p>"No," Begonia interrupted her as soon as she said two words. "I can't let you perform on stage yet, don't mention this matter!"</p>
<p>"Then, Papa, let's go busking!" Mei Bao said softly, with a hint of a smile, snuggling beside her father.</p>
<p>"Busking? What do you mean by busking, who are we going to sell it to?" Begonia asked with wide, distracted eyes, extremely doubtful. (280)</p>

<h3>New Inventions in Cartoon Production</h3>
<p>— Zai Yang</p>
<p>Producing cartoons is not an easy task. Everyone knows how difficult it is. Walt Disney mobilized hundreds of people and spent many years of effort to complete Snow White. Even the Chinese Iron Fan Princess, didn't the newspaper say that it took more than two hundred people to draw it? And these two hundred or more people are not just anyone, but artists! Because the characters in cartoons are dead and won't move on their own. You have to draw dozens of pictures to show one action. For example, raising a hand, dozens of pictures are almost the same, but the hand gradually rises. The background in these dozens of pictures is all the same. Therefore, cartoon producers feel the trouble of this repetitive work.</p>
<p>Now Hollywood has invented a new production method, that is, in addition to the characters in the cartoon, you can also shoot real backgrounds.</p>
<p>Originally, an opaque image is drawn on a transparent celluloid sheet - each character is painted with black and white paint. When viewed in a bright place, you only see the black outline of the picture, but when you use reflected light to illuminate it, the picture is clearly presented. Then, a pair of illuminating lights above shine on the drawing, and at the same time, the real movie set is projected from under the transparent celluloid. The characters in the drawing - that is, the opaque part - block part of the set. The background and continuous drawings are filmed simultaneously with a camera until the background and the characters in the drawing change. In this way, when it is shown, we can see the characters in the painting and remain in the real world!</p>
<p>This new cartoon production machine only needs to be equipped with an optical instrument condenser. If you want to shoot in five colors, you only need to paint the characters on the celluloid in five colors, and then add a rotating color separation filter to the condenser.</p>
<p>This new cartoon is better than the current cartoon production in terms of speed and economy.</p>
<p>Wait, and soon we will be able to see it.</p>

<h3>Harmonica Circle - Forming a National Association</h3>
<p>— Philosopher</p>
<p>Because the harmonica is easy to learn and use, the number of students has been increasing in recent years, making it the most popular mass music. In the past, famous groups promoting the harmonica had no contact with each other and acted independently, which is a pity. Now, Mr. Chen Jianchen, president of the Shanghai Harmonica Association, has contacted harmonica enthusiasts to initiate the organization of the "All-China Harmonica Association", using collective power to jointly work hard for the harmonica music in our country, and achieve the practical effect of promotion. After three months of preparation, it has been established. The address of the general association is temporarily located in the Shanghai Harmonica Association in the Zhonghe Building on Shanxi Road, Nanjing Road, and invites Chinese and foreign musicians to teach harmony, violin, piano, etc., to conform to the purpose of promoting music. Membership is divided into two types: group and individual. Recruitment has just begun. According to the person in charge of the association, the number of applicants is very enthusiastic. Many letters have been received from as far away as the inland and Nanyang, which is a good phenomenon in the harmonica circle in our country.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk, the City Filled with Dust from the Nomad Cavalry</p>
<p>So the doubt in his heart was temporarily put down. He talked to Liu Yining about the situation in the army and on the battlefield. Liu Yining did not take the bandits to heart, but considered the Qing army to be a cause for concern. He always thought that Wu Sangui was double-dealing, harboring ulterior motives, and could not be loyal and resourceful, and stabilize the country for the former dynasty. Xu Jing was also worried about this. After talking for a long time, the evening drum had struck three times, so Xu Jing put out the candle and went to sleep on the opposite kang. The next day Xu Jing got up, and Liu Yining also wanted to get up. Xu Jing told him to rest for another half day and not to work. In the afternoon, he couldn't hold back any longer and sat up. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei came to visit again. Wu Sangui also ordered officials to send a lot of food. Liu Yining thanked them and accepted it. Everyone sat and talked until dusk. Xu Jing told the soldiers to buy wine, and the four of them sat around the Xuantan Temple for a drink. Liu Yining shared the food sent by Wu Sangui with the other three. Everyone was encouraged and delighted because of the victory. Zhang Cangqiu was especially drunk. After getting drunk, he sang "The Great River Flows Eastward" in a passionate voice. They drank until late at night before Chen Fei helped Zhang Cangqiu leave. The next day, Liu Yining got up early in the morning, and his wound had healed. Wu Sangui had also ordered the army to set off, with Ma Bao and Bai Xianzhong's armies still as the vanguard. Although there were small groups of bandits resisting along the way, as soon as they made contact, they were like crushing dry weeds, and they were invincible in every battle. The bandits who invaded outside the pass were also defeated by the Qing army, and then they drove straight to the capital. After Li Zicheng was defeated, he fled back to Yanjing, still wanting to resist, but the morale of the army had wavered. Except for Liu Zong who was willing to fight to the death, the rest of the bandit generals advocated retreating to Shaanxi. Niu Jinxing couldn't make up his mind for a while. (236)</p>
