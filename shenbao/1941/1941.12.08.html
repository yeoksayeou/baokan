<h3>為挽救太平洋危局　美統統作最後努力</h3>
<p>第二次直接以私函電致日皇　指責日本軍隊進攻泰國行動</p>
<p>合衆社七日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統、將以私函電致日本天皇、作避免太平洋戰火之爆發之最後努力、國務院宣佈稱、羅斯福總統現以私函電致日本天皇、同時指責日本軍隊及海軍之行動、直可認爲係準備進攻泰國、此項宣佈有若晴天霹靂、其形　顯示政府對於遠東局面之嚴重、國務院正式宣佈稱、華盛頓官員所得之消息、表示日軍十二萬五千員雲集越南、受嚴密護衛之兩大日本運輸艦隊、正向暹邏灣開去、該兩運輸艦隊係昨日在越南之南端之柬埔寨角（又稱瀾泥尾）發見、國務院未說明關於羅總統致函日本天皇之佈吿、國務院官員亦未對此函予以闡明、日本軍隊在越南之集中、絕對與日本對羅斯福總統要求日本在遠東之意向之覆文、背道而馳、蓋日本聲言此種集中、純爲對付華軍在滇省之集中也、國務院稱、向暹遷灣開駛之日本運輸艦隊、昨晨在柬埔寨角東南被發現、該兩艦隊均包括大批船隻及護送戰艦、又據國務院稱、華盛頓所得之估計、表示越南南部日軍八萬二千名、越北部二萬五千名、另有康瀾　中運輸艦七軍隊一萬八千名、國務院此項佈告、係於行政當局研究日本對羅斯福總統之覆文以後發出、關於該兩運輸艦隊之開往　邏灣之宣佈、爲星期六全日由遠東傳來電訊中之漸趨緊張之軍要理由、國務院之消息稱、此種軍隊之運調、實可用以對泰國之海陸攻擊、國務院所接到之消息謂、日本計劃在盤谷海口外舉行海軍示威、足以迅即减少泰國之任何抵抗、該情報未嘗指明攻擊已實際上在進行中、然其印象、爲日軍頃已從事準備、倘司令部命令一下、攻擊即可開始、衆認爲羅斯福總統致日本天皇之私函、係關於在越南之威脅行動、足以捲全部遠東於戰爭中、在日本歷史上、日本之軍隊有時出以突然之行動、未爲日皇所悉、衆信羅斯福總統此項書札、係出於運用種種可能方法、以避免日本釀成戰禍之意願、此爲歷史上羅斯福總統直接致書日本天皇之第二次、第一次爲　國軍艦潘南號在揚子江被日本飛機炸沉之時、衆信羅期福總統之書札、將由東京之美國大使發出、然內容如何、無從獲悉云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社七日華盛頓電　太平洋時局、已屆極度緊張關頭、頃據陸軍部宣佈、阿拉斯加所建之軍用飛行塲數十處、及各種防禦工程、正在積極進行中、一切困難、在所不顧、同時民用航空管理局、亦在阿留申羣島建築飛行塲十處、俾橫貫北太平洋而至亞洲海面、而成爲太平洋防務之一部份、美國海軍在荷屬港口、據有驅逐機與轟炸機之主要根據地兩處、此項根據地之建築、工程極爲艱苦、蓋時値冰凍期間、且日短夜長若干月中、每日僅見日光三小時云、</p>
<p>日官方對政府覆文　暫不表示任何意見</p>
<p>合衆社七日東京電　日本政府入士、昨日拒絕評論華盛頓披露日本對羅斯福總統所質間關於日本在遠東之意向、及集中軍隊越南之理由之覆文、官員稱、「上星期內閣情報界發言人之聲明外、吾人再無他言、」「日本同盟社認爲難斯福總統之質間、乃試探日本之眞正用意之舉動、據稱、日本政府頃方「堅强注意美國之第二步行動、另一方面對於太平洋ABCD陣綫瘋狂地在西太平洋增防之舉、並未忽視、同盟社又稱、「日本政府額示不屈不撓之態度、此事殊堪吿慰、」頃間「讀賣新聞」顯著登載泰國首相宋格籣之宣言稱、泰國並未與任何「第三國」簽訂秘密之軍事協定、然泰國於戰爭無法避免時、將英勇作戰、「日日新聞」稱、英國已加緊其對泰國之壓迫、該報稱、「泰國政府改　其中立之時已近、」</p>
<p>美各方對兩國關係　認為前途未可樂觀</p>
<p>合衆社七日華盛頓電　於國務　赫爾表示遠東局勢仍無改變後、政府人員對未來之美日關係、繼續表示悲觀、赫爾稱美政府雖然接獲日本之覆文謂、日本之駐軍越南、並非爲侵略目的、僅爲抵禦集中於雲南邊境之華軍、其數額亦並未越過協定中規定者但赫爾國務卿仍以爲大日兩國間之關係、並不因此項覆牒而與昔日有所不同、赫爾拒絕批評日本之答覆，此間認爲任何在越南日軍之新侵略行動、必將招致遠東大戰之發生、但日本之覆牒中、否認此項軍隊將作爲侵略之目的、然則日本之態度、仍表示希望危險之局勢、不致爆發也、可恃觀察家相信、倘將來蘇聯大敗、或英國在里比亞局勢不利、則日本熊度將有激變之可能、但目前最重要之事而可能的決定將來之美日間關係者、除非越南之日本軍閥不復控制東京政府、將爲東京答覆國務卿赫爾在十一月二十六日所提之牒文、因該文會引出美國對遠東之基本原則、據日本特使來栖及野村大使之表示、該項覆文已在東京謹愼準備中、並稱、報紙所載對此項覆文之報吿、較之彼等之官方消息所發表者更多、若由東京各界發表之言論現竟告實現，則日本勢將不能接受赫蘭之牒文、以爲談判爭點之基本原則、而該項爭點、則終將使美日兩國之間瀕於戰爭者也、</p>
<p>美總統請國會核准　增加國防補充軍費</p>
<p>路透社七日紐約電　羅斯福總統頃已請參院於衆院所已核准國防補充經費八、二四四、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元外、再增加七〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元、查總統今所請之款內、以五千萬元專供海事部船塢局建築未指定的公共工程之用、其餘則充在波斯頓修理水兵營房調查外人特務機關、乃爲海岸巡防艦二十九艘裝置設備以防磁性水雷等經費、參院　支小組會已接到總統夾文、故昨已集議、以期迅速處理之、</p>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　美國海軍部已减低募兵體格之標準、凡無關重要之缺陷、前爲入伍之障碍者、今後將予以通融、</p>
<p>路透社七日馬尼刺電　此間海軍當局對於紐約所傳日軍艦刻在台灣與北呂宋羣島間一帶游弋之說、不置批評、並謂彼等未接關於此說之情報、</p>
<p>日攻勢隨時可爆發　華府注意遠東事態</p>
<p>國際社七日華盛頓電　政府方面昨日對遠東之特殊軍事準備、賡績予以注意、權戚方面承認、日本侵略新政勢、隨時可以爆發、日美談判現已停頓、此後談判行動、仍繫於日本、國務卿赫爾於十一月二十六日之對日牒文中、會重申準備根據基本原則、以解決目下太平洋問題之異見、東京須先行答從此項牒文、始可重開談判、靈通界人士相信、華盛頓可於下週中接獲日本之復文、但東京方面並未有準備接受美方所定條件之跡象、同時過去數日間遠東所發生之七大發展、已使華府重入緊張及戒備狀態之下、此七大發展爲、　據澳　各綫雷台報吿、又有日軍分遣隊源源開入越南、　新加坡已取銷所有陸海軍兵士之告假、　菲律濱奎松總統已制定菲政府緊急方案、　遠東美軍總司令麥克沃塞中將迄今尙在與奎松總統會商菲島之防務問題、　新加坡新當局殺厲控制非英籍居民、不准其離開馬萊亞、　日正在加速撤退香港馬萊亞婆羅洲及新加最之僑民、　若荷印遭受攻擊、澳已保證予以援助、同時墨爾缽先驅報昨稱、澳政府「因預料太平洋上或將發生戰事、」故正與ABCD各國會商一切云、</p>
<p>路透社七日華盛頓電　路透社特派員稱一般人咸認日本關於越南之復文、爲拖延時日之技倆、蓋欲觀望蘇聯與里比亞戰事之結果而定其動止、如德軍果勝、則日本即將推進其侵略計畫也、華盛頓時報指出、日本復文中之託詞、謂日本明明將泰國圈入大日本計盡中，統察種種情形、日人準備在其征服亞洲之程序中、攫取泰國、惟ABCD諸國鑒於日本在越南造成之威脅地位、決不致稍懈其準備云、</p>
<p>泰國首相獲得全權　準備應付一切事變</p>
<p>路透社七日新加坡電　泰相桑格蘭、因泰國議會昨已通過緊急立法案故、已成爲泰國實際上之狄克推多、據此間無綫電稱、　案予泰相以絕對全權、其時期為十二個月，泰相得據此採行取締第五縱隊之特殊步驟、並完全統制各種運輸、泰政府昨晚已發文吿、　請民衆援助政府、保障國家安全之新計書、重要工業不許罷工、而外僑行動須受管理云、</p>
<p>路透社七日盤谷電　盤谷報紙、皆刋載日相東條對美總統而發在越日軍非爲對泰威脅之保證但未加以批評、中立觀察家則謂泰政府仍應積極進行其準備、而密切注視遠東之發展、不稍弛懈云、同時一般泰人現　有暫忘政治之趨勢、而準備舉行紀念憲政成立九週年之三日慶祝、</p>
<p>路透社七日新加坡電　路透社特派員聲稱、大批日艦已通過越南之南端（距馬來海岸約三百哩、）現循西北向盤谷方面駛行之消息透露後、局勢無疑已轉趨嚴重、吾人或可臆斷星期六晚間英海軍及其他兵士之被召回、大約即係因此、斯時有彼此關係緊張、如英美日者之大批軍艦、開始在彼此區域內盤旋巡弋、殊不免冒有星火燎原之危險、此間官方人士對於坡近發展之重要性、並不加以輕視、惟信衝突或仍可避免、並作種種努力以防止過分之悲觀、羅斯福總統之直接向日皇呼籲、已引起一般人士之希望、認爲賢助之忠吿或將在日本佔得優勢、而使目前遠東之危險發展停止前進、</p>
<p>民主各國大軍雲集　準備應付遠東事變</p>
<p>路透社七日仰光電　仰光負責方面評論遠東時局之最近發展謂、遠東局勢今已回至如過去數十日來原有之狀況，即日本必須決定和戰是已、日本之政策與行動、已招致大軍集於太平洋區域、而此軍隊、因日本之進退不定、已獲動員之充分時間、如日本砍依照軸心國習慣完成其手段、則人人皆準備應付之、非至日本被打到後、決不願與之談判、屆時日本無疑的將落至無足重輕之地位矣、日本前途、刻在其人民與穩健領袖之掌握中、彼等在此最後時間、尙可起而救國云、</p>
<p>路透社七日仰光電　根據今日成立之緬甸國防條例修正案、緬甸政府已賦有權力得徵發全國壯丁人力以應付任何眞正或司能之攻擊、或便利英國軍隊之活動、</p>
<p>路透社七日仰光電　緬甸報紙論過去三星期中之日本政策謂、其目的在查明如何能繼續邁進而不致引起對英美之戰爭、則日方能使ABCD戰綫破裂、而東京將放胆前進、但日方此種目的今已為英美所洞知矣、</p>
<p>路透社七日重慶電　半官方面謂、日本答美總統請問之覆文、無異為對於美國人民之污辱、其眞正用意無疑的在表示其不願放棄侵略、而欲於軍事準備完成時發動而已、日本今旣已完全佔人越南、維希勢難作不利於日本之證明、而日方所發華軍威脅越南之說、亦莫能掩飾日本奪取他據土地之野心云、</p>
<p>荷印對太平洋局勢　積極準備決不懈怠</p>
<p>路透社七日巴達維亞電　華盛頓之最近發展、尙未使荷印續採更遠大之計盡、雖負責發言人昨稱、華盛頓昨日傳來之種種矛盾消息、已證實荷印所抱危機、即在目前、準備不容稍懈之觀念、但此間在表面上仍保持鎮靜態度、荷印總督赴鄕間度其週杪、但仍與各當局時常接洽、行政機關雖週杪不辦公、但許多人員並未入山休憩、蓋防有意外事件發生也、官塲對於日人航空綫由巴勞通至葡　狄摩爾事、仍予以密切注意、以防日人侵佔狄摩爾、蓋若華盛頓談話破裂、則荷印後方之戚脅、不可不極密切注視也、荷印官場不願發衣關於日方航空綫之意見、亦不願討論日方水上飛機之活動、是否僅以非陸地之海面爲限、惟承認一旦戰事發生、則此問題亟須解決、</p>
<h3>美為應付嚴重局勢　須建兩洋海軍　海長諾克思向總統提出報吿</h3>
<p>合衆社七日華盛頓電　海軍部長諾克斯上校、於昨日所發衣渠之向羅斯福總統之每年報吿書中稱、美國已遭遇極危險之國際局勢、以致必欲建設兩洋海軍、以抵禦可能之聯台國家之進犯、「諾克斯上校于其報吿書中稱、美國應由自英國獲得之根據地實爲眞疋保護西半球之要素、」該報吿又稱、「美國因欲造成世界有史以來海軍最大之擴大程序、故已成世界之最大海軍强國矣、渠提出軍艦之數共計三百二十五艘、新飛機二千〇五十九架、並展長兩洋之海軍根據地、兵員自一六二六四增至一、一三、九六二人、當提關於加里比安海及太平洋之聯合行勸、諾克斯稱、「新聯合程序業已完成、」渠稱、今年不實施大艦隊示威行動、因兵艦均駐於戲地帶、以待機應付任何緊急局勞、不能使彼等集中于一處、以破壞戰事陣綫也、諾克斯又稱、在太平洋大西洋及亞洲艦隊、爲保護美國之利益起見、均巳予以改組、</p>
<h3>日艦移向　越南海岸</h3>
<p>合衆社七日新加坡電　此間官方本日宣稱、英國偵察機已證明有許多軍艦在越南海岸附近移動、（公報並未言明軍艦之國籍、但權戚方面則謂此項軍艦僅能係日本軍艦、</p>
<h3>日駐美使館　人事調動</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社七日華盛頓電　日本駐美大使館頃宣佈、一等書記官寺坡及三等書記官高木、即當分別調往巴西及智利任事、大使館　贊稻川、及藤山則當調回東京外務省、此外尙有外交官三人、當分別自東京上海及巴拿馬三地、調來此間大使館服務、關於此項人事調動、並無特別意義云、</p>

<p>今晨四時三十分許、突有砲聲起自浦江東首、約一刻鐘、天空并起黑姻、雜有機聲、居民多從夢中驚醒、詳情截至付印時止、未能判明、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>美日和戰之謎</h3>
<p>本月六日日方向美國所送達關於增兵越南問題的答覆，一般都認爲其所提供的解釋絕非美方所能同意或接受。與此同時，則美國務院正式宣佈日軍已有十二萬五千雲集越南，其中四分之三皆在越南南部，且有兩大運輸艦隊正開向暹羅灣，擬在該處舉行海軍示威云云。雖然美當局至今並未對日方覆文加以正式駁斥，而上述消息之經由國務院公布，卽適無異於暴露日覆文所稱日在越駐軍並未超過法日協定規定數量與日軍開赴越南係防範華軍威脅，兩點之全非事實。如果日方此項覆文本意在於避重就輕敷衍美國，則結果適足見其對美談判之缺乏誠意，且更加重了對美國的刺激。是以卽使美國上月二十六日的通牒，日方至今仍在縝密研究遲遲置答之中，却無人敢對此一前途作樂觀的期待；以雙方根本大相逕庭的立塲，臨到大軍對峙一觸卽發的危機，如果說日本未來的對美覆文竟令與其目前所表現於行動及言論者相反，且具回天之力，能一舉化干戊爲玉帛，這實在是不容想像的事。</p>
<p>美國務卿赫爾隔昨於招待報界時表示美日談判可望賡續進行，並謂過去四十八小時內遠東局勢並無重大變化：樂觀的看法固然不妨因而認爲美方尙不致因日方關於增兵越南的答覆不能滿意而驟將談判停止，因之前途的萬一之望也尙未斷絕。不過在事實上，目前情勢却已較之本月二日美方質問未經提出之前更見惡化，如以日方此一覆文與其在越行動相對照，正適足說明其對美進行着極壞的兩面政策——藉自衛的掩護做攻勢的配置——卽謂那一質問爲毫無所獲亦不爲過。而羅斯福總統乃適於此際致書日皇，這是一件非常舉動，也是美當局挽救太平祥危機的最後努力，在緊張已達極度的遠東局勢中，自不免要發生相當激動。現在函件內容固未披露，但亦不難加以想像；意者羅斯福總統必本其一貫的悲天憫人之念，切望日本窮途知返，以避免太平洋大戰慘禍之不幸爆發；至於美國對此所持根本見解，則數年以來尤其是自羅邱宣言發布以來，殫述己多，且上月廿六日致日通牒中更有最後的說明，日方對此當已耳熟能詳，羅氏無論在此次函件中有否觸及，比較到並不重要。現在華盛頓的談判，在日方正式覆文未提出以前，已屬無可再談，而日方對於此一通牒的答覆，又適如本報昨日社評所提出：在和戰之間徬徨莫決，足見其色縱厲，其情已餒！不過日政府挾於積重難返之勢，勢難循着政治常軌作懸崖勒馬之圖，則於無可如何中把這一問題逕向日皇做直接控訴，容或可能得到爲一般外交途徑所不能獲致的效果。羅總統此度致書日皇的本意，預料當不外此。</p>
<p>就日本目前處境而論，其如此一味任情冥行，誠屬有百害而無一利，對於中國，且患制勝無方，更何況對付ABCD在遠東實力的總和。炎炎大言，只足自長虛驕之氣，而絕無補於匱乏的國力。近十年來，也曾有過利於日本擴展的時機，而尤以去夏英法在西綫敗北之際爲其最高峯；不過自彼以往，則侵略軸心處境日非，民治陣容聲威復振，時至今日，這一　重已絕對傾於反侵略陣綫一方，歐非如此，遠東尤然，日本在前此的黃金時代且不足以有爲，更何論於侵略已屆末路的今日？不過在日本，其擴展要求的發展，並不是全與國際形勢相適應，銳意南進與建置「高度國防」雖均爲去夏納粹勝利所促成。在時間因素上則僅能趕上納粹勝利的背影，及至於配置完成準備行動，則時勢全非，納粹聲威已成往迹，民治陣綫亦多有備，專就形勢而論，如事冒險，自難悸逞，不過另一方面，年餘以來言論的鼓吹，動員的策進，在內部已勢同騎虎，退嬰將無以自解。這一矛盾，正籠罩日本政局，形成當局苦悶的量大根源。最近侵蘇德軍戰况益形不利，英美在遠束的應變配備亦較前益告堅强，而猶不足使日本對遠東危局的態度發生決定影饗，這不是某一些人的過分頑强，而是已往所造成的惡果積重難返，非等閒所能爲力，且此亦非所能望於在急進軍人支配下的現政權與其出征軍人。假使美方願望眞有獲得貫澈可能，則沉毅的少壯軍人首領東條當比任何人都適於做此決定，如果日本現當局對此已無能爲力，則此次羅斯福函件也難望有更大的成就。</p>
<p>歷史的發展有時是完全離開當者事的利害打算與意志支配的，太平洋危機之能否脫離此一慣例，目前已屆最後關頭，拖延只是徒然。預料此一和戰之謎的揭布當已不在遠了。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談</p>
<h3>作戰兩年後的德國</h3>
<p>他們還是這個村莊在整個戰爭中最初爲國捐軀的健兒。現在東錢的大屠殺，已使德國許多家庭很親切的感覺到父子，兄弟，夫婦的生離死別之痛。假使美國積極參戰，我相信對於德國民氣，一定會有非常惡劣的影響</p>
<p>德國人已顯露着一種朕兆，無論戰爭的勝負誰　，無論繼希特勒而起者爲何種政治，他們從納粹泥潭中拔足出來，終不免帶着一些泥滋味和土氣息。要把反猶太運動的痕跡完全消減，恐非易事。要望民治主義的順利推行亦很困難，至少需經過相當的時期。而要使德國人生活在沒有成就。法所規定一切的環境中，亦不是件容易的事吧。</p>
<p>柏林人常很仔細的數着公共汽車中可供站立的地位。章程上寫明祇准站立十三人，假使已有十三人站着，即使車中地位很寬，還可容納十人，他們也寗可守候下一部公共汽車哩。</p>
<p>有一次，我坐在一輛公共汽車裏，因爲前面開着紅燈，車子忽然停住，一個人從後面上車，立時有一年約十三四歲旁着短褲的男孩干跟着跳下去，把他的衣服拉住說，「這裏不是停車的站頭，快點回上車來。」那個人始則莫明其妙的望着，旣而看見他很認眞的樣子，便道，「快些放手，否則我要…」其時車已在開動了，孩子還拖住那人，後來看見拖他不轉，始在最後一秒鐘跳回車上，望着立在下面的乘客，還悻悻的說着「這裏不是停車站頭，這裏不是停車站頭」呢</p>
<p>眞止的消息，已不復從德國「流出」，祇是「滴出」而已。各國新聞記者已大半離開德國，留下的亦因檢查日嚴，而覺得束手縛脚。近來滴出的消息，更是微乎其微，好多天方繼有一些。最近乘船回國的一百十八個美國外交官和領事官，雖遵照國務部命令緘口不談，然於德國內部情形，仍有下列這幾點透露出來：</p>
<p>英機轟炸近很奏效，不獨在漢堡如此，在哥龍也是如此。婦孺遷離漢堡的已有好幾萬，港內幾看不見一艘船。哥龍的大禮拜堂矗立在頹垣殘壁之中。城中心已化爲一堆瓦礫。驚悸忘魂的居民，入夜都擁擠在公共廣塲下的巨大防空室中</p>
<p>德國人對於東綫戰爭，日見焦慮，每星期由前綫送回的傷兵（陣亡及被俘的當然在外）約有二萬人。德國煉鋼業在一九四〇年已跌至二八·一五〇·〇〇〇噸，計减少一·四六七·〇〇〇噸，（美國一九四〇年煉鋼業共出六六·九九三·〇〇〇噸）。</p>
<p>國社黨機關報「黑衫黨」會發表下面這一節驚人的新聞說：「假如以德國對俄戰爭爲欲解放歐洲，脫離布爾什維克主義的勢力，這是絕對的錯誤。我們對俄作戰，不是爲保全文化，保全文明，或保全民治主義，祗不過保全德國而已。」（完）</p>

<p>當此兩租界當局管理物價漸收成效之際、英美船隻、因國際局勢緊張、突停止駛滬、致使本市對外交通、感覺船隻缺乏、工部局方面、對於進口各種必需品、已得平準會供給外滙、除決定確保兩租界現有物資、禁止麵粉等被偷運出境、由運輸委員會租用上海曾力公司船隻一艘、同時充分利用工部局使用第三國船隻之優先權、疏通貨運外、並爲穩定物價起見、希望商人能將所囤存貨脫手、依照限價出售、</p>
<p>請求授權　取締存貨</p>
<p>例如界內所存洋米、不論品質如何、按照每石一百三十元規定價格、應全部由工部局收買、分配予全市各米號零售、惟因價格未妥、在最近若干日來、一部惟利是圖罔識大體之商人、竟又不願將存貨脫手、致管理物價前途、不無困難、工部局有鑒於此、爲謀對於管理物價各項措施、獲得法律依據、俾能對不願將存貨脫手者、有權取締起見、經該局數度會曦結果、決定按照前次頒布地皮章程新附則第五十三條之前例、擬請領團另行增訂新附則一條、昨日經大中社記者自外人方面探悉、此項申請書、業已向領袖領事希爾提出、一俟獲得領團之許可、即可公布、俾得標本兼施、澈底管理本市物價、</p>
<p>美兩貨輸　臨時回航</p>
<p>美國總統輸船公司某要員披露、美貨船兩艘、載貨從美出發、原定經檀香山與菲島來滬者、現已在馬尼刺卸貨、該兩船係海妖號與美國領袖號、乃美國開拓輪船公司所有、而美國總統公司經營者、巳於前數日內駛抵馬尼刺、卸貨完畢後、將取消來滬航程、直接駛返美國、除此兩船外、原定駛滬之其他美船、並無改在馬尼刺折返者、至於上月杪載美軍離滬之麥迪森總統號與哈立遜總統號兩輪、均已抵馬尼刺、哈立遜總統留泊該埠、麥迪森號則駛往新加坡、不久將返菲島、然後回美、</p>
<p>其他輸隻　照常來滬</p>
<p>總統公司各輸、目下並無短期內將來上海之徵象、本市美僑、搭本月中旬抵滬之法輪大達南號赴馬尼刺者、約十二月二十日可抵該埠、或將悉數轉搭麥迪森總統號輪返美、又據確悉、近又有巴拿馬輪數艘、駛抵滬埠、內兩艘係富洛案號與波亞卡號、後者係會德豐經理、從蘇門答臘戰煤抵滬、上海寄往美國之郵件、諒須待大達南號載出、至馬尼刺轉裝總統輸運美、上次載出寄美郵件之法郵公司貨船霞飛號、於十二月四日離滬、赴馬尼刺、其最後目的地爲西黃、</p>
<p>局米又將　提出發售</p>
<p>兩租界當局為調整界內米糧供給起見、特定於今日起、凡各缺米米號、如需要添購門售米糧者、若屬於公共租界者、則可向四川路立基洋行登記、一切手續、與領售工部局洋米相同、若屬於法租界者、則可向隣近各捕房登肥、於核准後、再行繳款掛貨、是項米糧、係由本市雜糧豆米兩業之棧存洋米六十餘萬包中提出、其工部局小絞米、決定於本月十日恢復發售、又昨日兩租界當局爲進一步防止購囤食米、將另售量减爲每次五升（八市斤）後、一部無知平民、竟誤認爲係界內存底缺乏之現象、多紛紛向各米號購米、以致較平日爲擁擠、一日間並發生携帶超越限量食米被扣留之事數起、</p>
<p>公允分配食糧　必要時始實行</p>
<p>至於計口搜糧計劃、尙在租界當局考慮之中、須視未來情形有必要時方始進行、據權威方面所知、租界內糧食、斷無不機之憂慮、界內存糧、向無確實數目、但以最近所傳之二百廿萬包為近似、每月用額約廿五萬包左右、當局且對於洋米麵粉兩項來源之輸入上海、已獲有整個辦法、且此項辦法、係得任何各國當道所同意協助、且凡有到滬之任何商輸、工部局有優先權裝載、租界最高當局方面、對於界內糧食之供給、亦會擬定切實方策、務使居民之糧食、由工部局繼續供給、即使太平洋戰事爆發、工部局所租賃之商輸、用以裝載上海租界供應品者、可獲得任何方面之通過、此次工部局限止購米以半斗爲限、並非工部局來現感缺乏、實因鑒於局米之消耗數量、越出居民所需以上、蓋奸徒仍以零購之工部局米、用以囤積也、</p>
<h3>英商祥泰木行　宣吿停業</h3>
<p>職工千餘遣散</p>
<p>大中社云、英商祥泰木行、係本埠最大之鋸木廠、近因木料來源運輸困難、前經股東會議議決、暫停營業、故該廠於昨日起、已停止工作、廠內職工千餘人、亦一律給資遣散、診廠在滬開設已達三十餘年、戰前在福建·南京·靑島·等處、均設有分廠、戰後相率停閉、損失甚鉅、但因上海總廠營業發達、尙足彌補、近因遠東局勢緊張之故、滬總廠亦竟不克維持而告停閉矣、</p>
<h3>禁止麫粉批發商　相互搬運</h3>
<p>竟有轉手十八次者　麫粉售價安得不漲</p>
<p>工部局辦理本埠麫粉存底登記、業已完成、進而統制個人需要、前日起已加緊實施禁運、並禁絕居間人從中取利、蓋有定貨一批、經十八家居間人輾轉漁利、最後係消費者付出巨大代價、據官塲消息、自昨日起、凡聲請搬運麫粉者、必須聲明其目的地、並須經工部局嚴密調查後、始准給予搬運許可據、如此則可防杜囤積、工部局今後發給搬運許可證、將僅限於由進口商連至批發商、或由批發商運至零售商、至批發商間之相互運送、則絕對禁止、以减少其轉輾漁利、及額外領證費用、衆信此項措置、結果當可抑低麫粉價格、</p>

<h3>公敎服務團　施贈貧民衣米一瞥　作為聖誕禮物</h3>
<p>— 圭</p>
<p>公敎服務團　昨日下午二時，假膠州路七三四號金科小學散發衣米予附近難胞貧民，招待彼等進麵包，並有演說唱歌表演等餘興，記者參與慈善集會多次，覺此次情形之溫馨歡樂，實爲創見，茲記其經過如次。</p>
<p>公敎服務團，爲天主敎信徒所組織之社會服務團體，團長陸增佐女士，其尊人陸伯鴻先生，生前爲我國天主敎最著名人物，嘗獲羅馬敎廷勅賜袍劍。　女士新自歐洲倦遊歸來，極能繼先人遺志，致力社會服務。該團每屆聖誕節時，必有施贈貧民衣物之舉，自一九三六年以來，未嘗問斷。昨日所施者爲拙衣百餘套，米若干包，棉衣全爲該團女團員半日抽暇親自縫製而成，故其意義不能與一般施衣相較。</p>
<p>二時正，貧民，來賓及團員均已齊集金科小學操塲，適逢煦陽當空，雖時已冬令，絕無寒意，操場中置長凳數十排，一部爲貧民座位，一部則爲來賓席。貧民老幼婦孺皆有，並有數盲者持竿點綴其間；井然列坐，一如學生聽講。衣米則置於數長桌上，編列號碼，準備分發。首由天主敎類思堂徐司鐸致詞，語多勉勵；繼由陸增佐女士致詞，大意爲吾人當以服務爲天職，有錢者出錢，有力者出力，今年因物價飛漲，經濟能力有限，故所能贈予者不多，惟望明年之事工及效果十倍於今日。</p>
<p>致詞畢，由金科小學生表演，計有兒童表情歌曲及短劇二節目，短劇中演貧兒之女學生，表情逼眞，歌聲凄切，驟視之幾疑為參與貧民之一。後由徐司鐸及團員將衣米逐一贈與在座貧民，彼等按次接受，並鞠躬致謝，頗類行異業禮時學生之接受文憑。其時有一西人貧者，衣覆不整，立於塲側，該團亦以棉衣一套贈予，始脫帽致謝而去。當時團員以麺包分發貧民，彼等一面進點，一面聽男女學生之唱歌，琴聲抑揚中，見彼等皆流露由衷之感激，公敎中不分階級，同座共樂之情形，實爲記奢參與慈善性質集合以來的第一次經歷。</p>
<p>陸女士語記者，該團將於最近期內携衣物至滬東區親自訪問貧家，當時贈予。並謂該團經濟及人力皆不足，熱望社會人士予以經濟及精神上的同情與援助，使他們的工作能日益擴展，使更多的貧民能得到助益。</p>

<h3>傳統先敎授主講　科學的人生觀（一）</h3>
<p>昨第十六次學術講座</p>
<p>本市學術請座昨爲第十六次講期在佛敎凈業社舉行、請哲學家傳統先敎授主講一科舉的人生觀」、先由主席朱錫璇致辭介紹、繼傳氏講述如次、</p>
<p>傳氏講題</p>
<p>本講座前在璇宮舉行、璇宮爲一劇場、作為看戲之用、今日來此舉行、雖非劇台、但我們却來研究演戲、因爲吾人平時生活、猶似在乾坤劇塲演戲、然其究爲何戲、該如何做、戲的眞相如何、即今日所欲講的人生觀問題、「科學的人生觀」就是利用現代科學知識（包括物理·化學·生理學心理學·及社會學）、來對人生作一種看法、茲暫限於以下三點來講、即人生到底是怎樣一回事、是苦的還是樂的、該怎樣去應付、先講</p>
<p>人生眞象</p>
<p>此點父可分兩方面講、　「何謂人生」人生乃人類之生命、也可謂爲有人格之生命、而生命必須有物質之基礎、其特點是能生長·營養·重生·適意·遺傳等等、生命原料、由物質所構成、其化學成分有脂肪·蛋白質·水·鹽·糖質、總之不外由氫·氧·燐·硫等元素組縱而成是定中求動、動中求定、使本身適應於環境之變化、求個體之生存、求種族之延續、如此造成爲人格之特點、　（又生宇宙間之地位）人在宇宙間之地位、及世界奇觀、即如天空之星、如海灘之沙、不可算計、地球是極小的一粒小沙、獵戶座星雲中之一星、其容積已大於太陽二千七百萬倍、而此種巨星、奔馳空中、猶似扁舟一葉浮於太平洋、雖與其鄰近之星、相間何止幾百萬里、地球之小可知、而人在地球上其渺小更不堪設想矣、但我們又不能自視太小、藍與自然間一切微塵細菌較其偉大又何如　「從科學方面研究人生眞象所得宇宙間一切皆動、而有一定之現律性過程與趨向、由混然一體而分化、由組織稀鬆而到組織嚴密、由具體到抽象、至精巧之點、人生活動於宇宙變化中、至現在爲止可視爲最富於分化、最富於組織、而最靈巧抽象、此新組織較原組織必較爲靈巧精細、方能進化發展、</p>

<h3>日本的兵站在那裏</h3>
<p>— 中島鈆三著　余貫一譯</p>
<p>來栖使美的經濟背景　無結果時的日軍動向　　這裏充分透露出日本經濟上的苦悶，並指示出他派夾栖使美的作用，同時又提綱挈領地暗示出日本未來的動向，美總統把日軍增駐安南的理由質問日本，眞正的答復就在這篇文章裏。——譯者証</p>
<p>後方運絡綫是軍用語，指維持野戰軍及其根據地間之一切軍用道路鐵路水路等交通綫；連絡綫上所需的一切必要設備，必要工具，以及維持軍需之一切物資的準備與補給，此爲兵站的任務。枵腹作戰是不可能的，如兵站活動不能充分滿足軍需，雖有巧妙的作戰計劃，也沒有戰勝希望。後方速絡終與兵站有關戰士生命，是作戰重要的條件。茲就日美關係，中日戰事，以及日本與南洋等關係，說明日本的兵站在那裏？</p>
<p>日本的外交，受經濟上依存英美的關係，特別是美國，故處處顧慮着美國的態度。八一三以來，日本不僅在對華作戰，也對中國背後的英美作戰。然而日本的兵站，恰和中國一樣，都在美英，日本作爲重要物資百分之五十以上依存英美，其中八成且取給美國。這是說：日本安危所寄的國防，操之敵手。無論如何力行生擴與物動計劃，至今仍非取得美國物資的進口不可。美國的援華雖令日人咬牙切齒，仍不能小對白宮陪笑，否則等於自己的手，毀滅自己的兵站。從來的日美會談，特別是今次的來栖使美，無不想阻止兵站上掛出叛旗。如果這次日美會談失敗，日本便非變更後方的連絡綫不可。</p>
<p>事實上，美國對日凍結資金以來，太平洋上的這條路綫已全部失效，日本的兵站上早已掛起叛旗：ABCD車綫的結成，對日經齊攻擊的開始，援華的益趨强化，兵站上已通過中國的作戰，向着前綫的日軍轟擊。因之日美會談如果失敗，日車司令官只有擊毀自己背後的兵站部隊；同時也只有從別處尋求自己的兵站。然而可以做日本的兵站在什麼地方呢？</p>
<p>德國斷然進攻蘇聯，理由也在奪回他背後的兵站。蘇聯如能忠實於兵站的勤務，正常維持對德糧食和石油的供給，這戰事也就不會發生。</p>
<p>受日軍攻擊了四年多的中國，至今尙能繼續作戰，他保有後方連絡綫的滇緬路也是一大原因。滇緬路上效果橋的兩岸，囤着龐大的勞力和修理材料，幾經日軍空襲與破壞，旋即修復；這也是根據他維持後方連絡綫的原則。近代戰中空襲的效果雖大，但不能在敵陣樹立太陽旗仍是沒有用的。擊毀中國後方連絡綫的必要，已不言而喻。那末日本應從何處下手呢？</p>
<p>滇越路也是中國的後方運絡綫，日軍佔領安南後已歸失效。西北連絡綫也是中國的兵站，德蘇開戰後，效用己經减少。因之要揣摩日軍今後的行動，所以已不難想像。</p>
<p>然則滇緬路不僅是中國的兵站，也是英美兵站的一部。如橡皮，錫，鎢等十餘種重要物資的供給，也用這條　來保障的。美國從兵站的地位威脅日本，日本也要從英美的兵站上去對抗。。</p>
<p>日本拿英美作自己的連絡綫，才形成日本國防上的致命傷。要克服這致命傷，必須建樹百年天計。試從美國與南洋的距離比較，日本從北美取給石油，離橫濱達四八三九力浬；如取之荷印，堇隔二六〇〇浬，就可把路程縮短三成以上，距離近，輸運日數也節减，於是運輸力也就相對增加。日本如從南洋輸入石油，生來一次的運瑜期可宿短十天乃至十七天，一年間的輸送量約可增大一百九十萬至二百四十萬噸。現在荷印也對日凍結資金，積極對日備戰他們已把日軍的實力估計錯誤（？）加入ABCD陣綫；不辭對日一戰。眞是大瞻妄爲之極。（譯自日文金鋼鑽雜誌十二月一日國防科學欄）</p>
<p>談古說今</p>
<h3>總行撤退說的　滙豊銀行小史</h3>
<p>— 朱鏡淸</p>
<p>滙豊銀行總行從香港撒退到新加坡的消息，和美國駐華軍隊的撤退，同樣刺激人心。這個經營遠東金融的英帝國先鋒隊—也是大本營的機關，竟至於暫時離棄他近百年的根據地；外加美商大通銀行又宣佈暫停存款權益的保護，時局的緊張，可謂已達頂點。</p>
<p>匯豐銀行和怡和洋行，是英國經營遠東的兩大經濟中樞；尤其是滙豐銀行，牠是維持所有英商企業的資金供給，擔任着經營遠東貿易上必要的　兌業務，還通過他的手來推行英帝國對華的資本出口，包括經濟的和政治的借款；自從中英合組滙兌平準基金管理委員會以來，牠在援助中國作戰經濟上的地位尤爲明顯。在美國沒有加入這半準會之前，牠儼然是平準會在滬的代表；就是現在，牠依然沒有稍减牠援助法幣的責任。</p>
<p>滙豐銀行成立於一八六六年，他是根據英王的特許狀，英國公司法，和殖民地政令三種法律而設立的。第一種根據表示牠負有特殊使命，第二種根據表示牠是英國的法人，第三種根據表示牠是個殖民地銀行。在牠成立之初，英國在遠東已有二十二個銀行，其中的元老便是存在迄今的麥加利。然而這二十二家英國系銀行，都沒有具備這三種資格；而且牠們的總行大都在倫敦；並且在此後的歷次經濟恐慌中大都倒閉；滙豐銀行突過遭些同樣的風潮而存在迄今，除了牠當局的本領外，也得力於牠的地位之受帝國政府的重視。然而地位這樣重要的銀行，却產生於一個普通宴會上的談天。</p>
<p>那還是一八六四年夏天的事，幾個住在香港的英商，怡和洋行的鼻祖—一位航行印度廣東間的輪船水手也在座，在一夜宴會上隨便談天中決定了開這銀行，完全用遠東英商資本設立的銀行。二個月後，就是同年八月六日就開創立會，翌年四月一日就開始營業。當初的公稱資本不過墨西哥銀幣五百萬元，實收一半，總行在香港，倫敦和上海設立分行，不久又到東京分設一行。開業後　　打擊，尤其在一八七五年　香港總行吃到一筆搪廠的大倒賬，倫敦的分行投資於西班牙公債及英國鐵道公司債中又損失了十七萬一千餘鎊。這正是禍不單行，牠的股票就頃刻間跌在票面三折之下，弄得狼狽不堪；於是開始澈底的整頓，情形才　漸好轉，資本和營業也開始相對的增加。第一次歐戰發生前，實收資本已增至一千五百萬港元。歐戰結束後又增爲二千萬港元；現在的資本雖依然二千萬余，但公積已突破一億一百餘萬，分支行遍及世界各地四十餘埠，去年一年間的純益便達一千三百九十餘萬港元。牠的股票，因之一向受股票商的注意。票面不過一百二十五港元，但一九三〇年以來的市價却常在一二千港元左右。這是公積金增加的魔力。只有一九三五年受着銀貴，和去年受着英國參戰等影響，兩度跌進一千港元開內。但去年跌價，正是上海外股投機狂熱時期，所以旋即回昇，且出一千五百港元。進入今年，市氣雖已遜色，但尙在千三四百元。這次撒退消息，原該刺激市塲，却反不見交易。</p>
<p>英國在遠東的遭個金融中樞，非特對華擁有巨額政治借款，目對各地重要企業也伸着資本的支配網。就在上海一地，地產方面有恒業，業廣，華懋；信託方面有中華鐵路，中英，福公司，上海銀公司；保險方面有遠東，堆棧方面有公和祥；貿易方面有愛蘭漢百利，大豐，寶生，茂隆，惇信，怡和機器，麥邊，福利，別發，泰興等；工業方面有怡和紡織，博德運絨綫，可的牛奶，上海自來水等等；眞是不勝枚舉。從牠現任各董事都是身兼不少商行董事或經理之職，便可以知道牠在各企業間的勢力，這眞不愧爲現代金融資本的代表。</p>
<h3>戰時商品常識　鋼鐵與廢鐵</h3>
<p>— 堉之</p>
<p>沒有鋼鐵，就沒有現代文化，也就沒有現代戰爭中的那些高度破壞力的兵器。從槍彈起以至砲彈飛嚴坦克軍艦，都非用鋼鐵製造不可。據挪威的一位軍事評論家計算。在一千公里長的戰綫上作陸空攻守戰一年，需要下列那麼多的兵器：</p>
<p>依此推算，那末每個兵士每個月鋼鐵的消費量，守軍要半噸，攻軍要二十分之十一噸，每年每人需六噸至六噸半：如出動一百萬兵士，一年便須六百萬至六百五十萬噸鐵的消耗。又依蘇聯元帥莫洛希夫所述，紅軍一軍團（即三個師團）的砲兵之砲彈發射力，每分鐘達六十噸。那末每小時便達三千六百噸，一萬噸砲彈不消三小時的射擊就完了。彈丸的主要原料便是鋼鐵，所有兵　的製造原料也是鋼鐵。沒有鋼鐵，就沒有現代戰爭；然則沒有鋼鐵，人類的現代生活也就沒法維持。別的不說，就拿家庭裏的主婦來說：沒有金屬鍋鑊，便不能煮飯燒菜。何况任何生產工具的製造，均非利用鋼鐵不可，史家說：人類進入鐵器時代，才有今日的科學文明。這是小能打半厘折扣的。</p>
<p>製鋼的原料是鐵砂和廢鐵，廢鐵的表面雖是酸化了，但是牠，品質依然不變。而且一噸廢鐵，比二噸含鐵量豐富的鐵砂還實惠。廢鐵的重要使可想而知。所以鐵礦貧乏的國家，戲鐵的需要自然旺盛，尤其在戰爭時期。</p>
<p>美國是世界廢鐵供給量最大的國家，每年可有四千萬噸以上的供給，一半是自用，一半是輸出。日本便是牠最大的顧者；現在美國已禁止廢鐵輸日，因而使日本的軍需工業狼狽不堪，不下於美國禁止石油輸日。</p>
<p>最近一年以來，我們已不能在馬路上看到滿載廢鐵的卡車了，一年之前，幾屬司空見慣。這些廢鐵那裹去了？不消說是運往日本。收回廢鐵運動，現正在各國熱烈地展開，日本更做得澈底。一各敎堂拆下了他鐵板鋼條　成德屋頂，得到了價値十二三萬日元的廢鐵；却用四十萬日元以上的修理費換上磚瓦。這是今日東京街談巷議的資料，用以强調收集民間廢鐵的宣傳。那末日美戰一旦開始，上海的水泥鋼骨大洋房和拆屋小工，也將碰到不同的運氣吧？</p>

<h3>又是囤貨</h3>
<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>天下的烏鴉總是一樣黑的。</p>
<p>你看，人家正在流血，把肉體來做國家的長城；許多老百姓爲了戰事，弄得家破人亡，財產灰燼；却還有一班沒良心的人，趁火打刦，混水裏撈魚，拚命想發橫財。上海國積居奇的奸商如是，成都破獲的囤案，一來也就是近二十起。天良何在？豈不可嘆！</p>
<p>在成都囤貨的，所囤的東西雖不像上海那樣的花色繁多，然而單刀直入，都是些「要命」的日用必需品。什麼米哩，菜油哩，布疋哩，松柴哩。都是大家少不來，而不惜花上許多錢去買的。囤貨者的心理，本來顧不到別人的死活，這且不必細表了。</p>
<p>這批囤貨者中間，偏有那些（所謂銀行家，富商們在內，看了已够叫人髮指；而其中竟還有公務人員——省府物價調整委會科員——在內，豈不叫人格外痛心。知法犯法，罪加一等，這幾個喪心病狂者，當然要受到最嚴厲的制我哩。</p>
<p>軍事委員會特別會議決議，對於囤積牟利的人犯，從嚴懲處；所有被捕者交由軍事法庭審判。將來如何處置，國家自有法律，我們且拭目以待之可矣。</p>
<p>倒是環顧左右，在上海還有許多猪油蒙着心的奸商們，不顧工部局平價辦法的苦心，市民們負擔的嚴重，還在那里想盡心機，剝削牟利、這里雖沒有經濟檢察隊的組織，可是大家爲切身利益計，正不防隨時留心，以匡工部局的不逮呢！</p>
<h3>水電車輛漲價</h3>
<p>— 曹文海</p>
<p>英商售車和公共汽車公司，要求增加票價的事經英租界當局置之不理，而未實行，（惟已提出附加律）不料法租界水電公司，突於十二月一日起實行張價，今番法租界電車和公共汽車公司，突如其來的漲價，一般市民，都莫名其所以然，若說米價　貴的話，現經當局抑平到一百三十元一石，再說燃料缺乏，售價堅昂的話，現在兩當局對於煤斤一項，也正設法疏通來源，抑平其售價，說到職工生活程度的增高，那大衆的生活程度，不見得不高，難道水電公司，十特別兩樣些乎，而且公司方面的利潤，也不見得推板。</p>
<p>法商水電公司，對於用戶電燈，自八月份起，每字增加到四角，至九月份又漲四成，每字為五角六分。十月份再漲每字爲六角，迨十一月份，水電公司發表，自動减低電費，每字减除四分，仍為九月份的五角六分，斯時自來水也同樣推退，數雖微細，市民莫不異口同聲的讀美，稱頌公司當局的賢明，體念市民的困苦，减輕重荷，會幾何時，今該公司悍然不顧輿悄，託詞開支不减，恢復到十月份的電費，每字仍爲六角，然其水費，則暗中已經增加，一漲再漲，一减即加，形似市場物品的漲跌，豈是公用事業機關應有的行爲乎</p>
<p>夫水電公司每次的漲價，形響到其他一切物品，跟之上漲，其勢可怕，淺近的話，牽動到住的問題，譬如房東因水電費漲價，要求房客增加，不遂其願，遭其斷水斷火的壓迫，偶而不愼失火，有水自能澆熄，不致燎原，倘在斷水的時候，火勢漫延，不可嚮爾，累及鄰居，斷火則暗中摸索，不得逃生，葬身火窟，屢見報載，十以筆者，尙望兩租界當局，在此時際，體恤民艱，對於水電公司突然的漲價，事關善之策，以符衆望吧</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！</p>
<p>「正是他家！」她把身子略略移動了一些，聚精會神地說：「他們也是打北方逃來的，一家四口，除了那位老太太和一對中年的夫婦以外，也有一個女兒，比我也許還大一歲。到上海大槪比我們早，初來時也因人地生疏，生活十分困難。但上個月裏，正當你傷得很重的那些日子，我在大門口不時進出，瞧他們身上都穿得齊整了許多，臉上也有了活色；後來我又聽見他們房裏有唱戲的聲音。前幾天，這兒的老板娘又跟我撩天，我偶爾問起樓下這份人家的事，她便一古腦兒的吿訴了我，……。」</p>
<p>秋海棠很出神地傾聽着，但同時又若斷若續地咳嗆了一陣。</p>
<p>「原來他們姓韓，那位姑娘的爸爸向來歡喜聽戲，在山東的時候，也時常玩票，慢慢地敎得那姑娘也會了。這次逃到上海以後，也像咱們一樣的無路可走，後來碰到了一個同鄕，敎他弄一把胡琴，每天帶着他姑娘上酒館裏去賣唱；唱一段規定是一塊錢，但也有給兩塊的，除掉館子裏的茶房多少要分幾文以外，逢到好的日子，也能掙上七八塊錢。昨夜我也偷偷地聽她唱過，實在並不比我好。所以要是咱們也走這一條路的話，說不定比他們還可以掙得多咧！（二八二）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>給傭婦帶領孩子？</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>中國的家庭中，大都把帶領孩子的責任，去託付給傭婦們，那些來自鄉間的傭婦，沒有受過敎育，怎樣可以負起這個重大的責任呢？她們所能殼敎孩子做的，無非是打人和罵人，尤其是後者，當孩子們學會說話的時候，就乘機地把這種不良的舉動，去深印在孩子們的頭腦裏。</p>
<p>寫「世界史網」和「未來世界」的英國大文豪惠爾斯，曾經說過一句話，「我們的幼年，在那些保姆的手下生長着，因此終不免受到她們的影響，而染取了她們的習氣。」這句話是不錯的，在英美各國的家庭裹，有許多主婦也把帶領孩子的責任，交給保姆，然而在英美各國的保姆，尙有相當的智識，還能殼敎小孩子做一點針線，或者爲孩子們讀幾頁書，在中國的傭婦就決沒有這種智識了。</p>
<p>當然，這最大的責任還是在做父母的身上，他們如果把帶領孩子的事，叫傭婦去做，自己不問不聞，專爲自己享樂打算，那末他們就沒有盡到做父母的責任。</p>
<p>事情也有例外，在孩子太多的家庭裏，一個主婦忙不過來，不得不找幾個幫手，在這種情形之下，做父母的仍舊不能忘記去注意孩子們的扶養，如果交給傭婦，那末就要努力加以督促，因爲傑出人才的造就，決不是容易的。</p>

<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>目下煤球很貴，所以我們可將包過東西的碎報紙，浸入水中，過夜，混以一半煤球散屑，共搗如破絮泥淖然，再將其握成圓塊，如拳大，俟日光中曝乾，即可代煤球應用；火力很猛，經久耐燒，較煤球更好，因煤球中混有泥土，而自製煤球以碎報紙代替，故效力更好，値得一試。</p>
<h3>去除煩惱</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>有許多家庭中的爭吵，都是由無謂的煩惱而起的，其實當你有點煩惱的時候，請你決不要呆坐着，還是向你的朋友訴說你的煩惱。同時也不要埋怨自己或者發怒。最好的辦法是立起身來，到外面去散步，或是找你的朋友，下列的四個步驟，更可以使你及時去除你的煩惱。</p>
<p>第一步：把你所煩惱的事情，搜集所有的事實。</p>
<p>第二步：把事實分爲好的和壞的兩種。</p>
<p>第三步：想一個計劃。</p>
<p>第四步：開始按照計劃實行。</p>
<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3>徴文揭曉之十　一個深夜不睡的妻子</h3>
<p>— 鮑嬰</p>
<p>我的家庭很簡單，一夫一妻和一個小孩。我丈夫的收入足可維持生活；他沒有什麼不良嗜好，不正行爲，平心說起來也算是個理想的丈夫了。至於我呢？我敢自信絕沒有絲毫不如人處，治家，領孩子，幫助丈夫料理職業上的雜務，一個男子還能更多要求他妻子嗎？</p>
<p>可是我們在感情上有了隔膜，他不說出來，我也不便向他解釋。原因是我喜歡夜起。我的夜起習慣可並沒有妨礙着他什麼呀，我們原是分床睡的，我一個人悄悄地起來，遮住了燈光使不過於明亮，於是便翻開愛讀的書籍來靜靜觀看，或是隨興之所至寫幾篇文章；我敢担保我絕不會吵擾他，最好的證據便是我三歲的孩子從未被吵醒過，這樣你能說那是件不應當做的事情嗎？</p>
<p>假如他是個明理的人兒，他應該同情我；因爲我之必須夜起原因乃是爲了白天沒有空，家庭雜務以及孩子吵鬧使我絕不能得有片刻工夫來專心寫讀，所以我就祇得省下睡眠時間來滿足自己的慾望，那不是件値得同情的事情嗎？尤其是身爲丈夫的他，更加應該爲我的快樂着想。誰知他，唉，不但絲毫沒有同情憐惜之心，還把這事看作我的過錯似的。他可不是老頑固派，他是個嶄新大學出來的優秀靑年哪，難道也認爲女子只應該縫衣繡枕頭花，而不能够看書寫文章嗎？我知道他是這樣想的，因此每逢我在白天裏做事稍有錯誤時，他便用冷嘲熱諷的口吻說：『你是夜來太用功辛苦哪，所以日裹便精神不濟了。』他把人家偶然的錯誤都歸罪到夜讀上去，彷彿不夜讀便絕對不會有絲毫錯誤的了。哼！有時他還說，『我知道你是寫作天才，叫你管家務原是委屈了你呀！』那更不成話了。諸如此類，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>這類小齟齬，在目前看來也許尙不能算是什麼家庭問題，但，長此以往，勢必將使雙方感情漸趨決裂的了。我不能停止寫讀，也不能在夜間以外抽出任何時間來從事此類工作，假如他不能改變初衷的話，則後患眞是不堪設想的了。</p>
<p>編者按寫作其實是婦女們最好的消遣，讀書也是主婦們增進智識的良好方法。我不能怪你深夜不睡，因爲寫作原是要有情緖的。因此有美國的婦女文摘雜誌，曾有一篇文章，勸吿女子不要嫁像給一個從事寫作的丈夫。</p>
<p>現在鮑嬰女士的情形，剛巧相反，因爲深夜不睡，所以引起了丈夫的不滿，這或者有二種原因，一種是或者因爲專心於寫讀，而忽略了夫婦間精神的調劑，第二種或者是由於做丈夫的好勝的心理，他不願意他的太太會比他能幹，好勝是一般人的普遍性格，因爲好勝，就忘記了別人的權利了。</p>
<p>我以爲最好的辦法，是採取一種緩和的方法，如果要在晚上起來，不妨减少幾次，因爲婚姻的持久和幸福，完全要雙方互相諒解，各自校正自己，如果各趨極端，一定要造成不良的結果。</p>
<p>但是決不要放棄進取的精神，因爲中國的文化，正需要努力地推進。</p>

<h3>In an Effort to Save the Pacific Crisis, the US Government Makes a Final Effort</h3>
<p>Second Private Letter Sent Directly to the Japanese Emperor, Accusing Japanese Troops of Attacking Thailand</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 7th - President Roosevelt will send a private letter to the Japanese Emperor as a last effort to avoid the outbreak of war in the Pacific. The State Department announced that President Roosevelt is now sending a private letter to the Japanese Emperor, while accusing the Japanese troops and navy of actions that can be regarded as preparing to attack Thailand. This announcement was like a bolt from the blue, and its shape shows the seriousness of the government's view of the Far Eastern situation. The State Department formally announced that information obtained by Washington officials indicates that 125,000 Japanese soldiers are gathered in Vietnam, and two major heavily guarded Japanese transport fleets are heading towards the Gulf of Siam. The two transport fleets were discovered yesterday at Cape Cambodia (also known as Lan Ni Wei) at the southern tip of Vietnam. The State Department did not explain the announcement regarding President Roosevelt's letter to the Japanese Emperor, and State Department officials did not clarify the letter. The concentration of Japanese troops in Vietnam is absolutely contrary to Japan's reply to President Roosevelt's request for Japan's intentions in the Far East, as Japan claimed that this concentration was purely to deal with the concentration of Chinese troops in Yunnan Province. The State Department stated that the Japanese transport fleet heading towards the Gulf of Siam was discovered yesterday morning southeast of Cape Cambodia. Both fleets included a large number of ships and escorting warships. According to the State Department, estimates obtained by Washington indicate that there are 82,000 Japanese troops in southern Vietnam, 25,000 in northern Vietnam, and another 18,000 troops in a transport ship in Con Son. The State Department's announcement was issued after the administration studied Japan's reply to President Roosevelt. The announcement regarding the departure of the two transport fleets to the Gulf of Siam was the increasingly tense military reason in the telegrams from the Far East throughout Saturday. The State Department's message stated that this kind of troop movement could be used for sea and land attacks on Thailand. The message received by the State Department stated that Japan plans to hold a naval demonstration outside the mouth of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, which is enough to quickly reduce any resistance from Thailand. The intelligence did not specify that an attack was actually in progress, but the impression was that the Japanese army had already made preparations, and if the headquarters gave the order, the attack could begin. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's private letter to the Japanese Emperor concerns the threatening actions in Vietnam, which are enough to drag the entire Far East into war. In Japanese history, the Japanese army sometimes takes sudden actions without the knowledge of the Japanese Emperor. It is believed that President Roosevelt's letter stems from the desire to use all possible methods to avoid Japan causing war. This is the second time in history that President Roosevelt has written directly to the Japanese Emperor, the first time being when the US gunboat Panay was bombed by Japanese aircraft in the Yangtze River. It is believed that President Roosevelt's letter will be sent by the US ambassador in Tokyo, but the content is unknown.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 7th - The Pacific situation has reached an extremely tense juncture. According to the Army Department, dozens of military airfields and various defense projects built in Alaska are being actively carried out, regardless of all difficulties. At the same time, the Civil Aeronautics Administration is also building ten airfields in the Aleutian Islands to traverse the North Pacific to the Asian waters and become part of the Pacific defense. The US Navy has two major bases for destroyers and bombers in Dutch ports. The construction of these bases is extremely difficult, as it is during the freezing period, and the days are short and the nights are long, with only three hours of sunlight each day for several months.</p>
<p>Japanese Officials Offer No Comment on Government Reply for the Time Being</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 7th - Japanese government officials yesterday refused to comment on Washington's disclosure of Japan's reply to President Roosevelt's questions regarding Japan's intentions in the Far East and the reasons for concentrating troops in Vietnam. Officials said, "We have nothing more to say than the statement made by the spokesman for the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau last week." "Nippon Dempo believes that President Roosevelt's questions are an attempt to probe Japan's true intentions. It is said that the Japanese government is currently paying 'close attention to the second step of action by the United States and has not ignored the Pacific ABCD line's mad increase in defenses in the Western Pacific'. Nippon Dempo also said, 'The Japanese government's unwavering attitude is comforting'." Recently, "Yomiuri Shimbun" prominently published a declaration by Thai Prime Minister Songgram stating that Thailand has not signed any secret military agreements with any "third country," but Thailand will fight bravely when war is unavoidable. "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that Britain has intensified its oppression of Thailand. The newspaper said, "The time when the Thai government changes its neutrality is near."</p>
<p>US Parties Believe Prospects for Relations Between the Two Countries are Not Optimistic</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 7th - After Secretary of State Hull indicated that the Far Eastern situation has not changed, government officials continue to express pessimism about the future of US-Japan relations. Hull said that although the US government has received Japan's reply stating that Japan's garrison in Vietnam is not for the purpose of aggression, but only to resist the Chinese army concentrated on the Yunnan border, and that the number has not exceeded what is stipulated in the agreement, Secretary of State Hull still believes that the relationship between the two countries has not changed from the past due to this reply. Hull refused to criticize Japan's reply. It is believed here that any new aggressive action by Japanese troops in Vietnam will inevitably lead to the outbreak of a major war in the Far East, but Japan's reply denies that these troops will be used for the purpose of aggression. However, Japan's attitude still expresses the hope that the dangerous situation will not break out. Observers believe that if the Soviet Union is defeated in the future, or the United Kingdom is in a disadvantageous situation in Libya, Japan's attitude may change drastically. But the most important thing at the moment and the possible decision that will determine future US-Japan relations, unless the Japanese warlords in Vietnam no longer control the Tokyo government, will be Tokyo's reply to Secretary of State Hull's note on November 26, because that document will elicit the basic principles of the United States towards the Far East. According to Japanese special envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura, the reply is being carefully prepared in Tokyo, and they said that the reports in newspapers about this reply are more than what has been published by their official sources. If the opinions expressed by various circles in Tokyo are now realized, Japan will inevitably be unable to accept Hull's note as the basic principle of the point of contention, and that point of contention will ultimately bring the United States and Japan to the brink of war.</p>
<p>US President Asks Congress to Approve Increased Supplementary Military Spending</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th - President Roosevelt has requested the Senate to add another 70,000,000 yuan to the supplementary defense appropriation of 8,244,000,000 yuan that the House of Representatives has already approved. The funds requested by the President today include 50 million yuan specifically for the Navy Department's Bureau of Yards and Docks to construct unspecified public works, and the remainder to be used for repairing sailor barracks in Boston, investigating foreign intelligence agencies, and equipping 29 Coast Guard patrol boats to prevent magnetic mines. The Senate subcommittee has received the President's memorandum and has therefore convened a meeting yesterday to expedite its handling.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th - The US Navy Department has lowered the physical standards for enlistment. Minor defects that were previously obstacles to enlistment will now be accommodated.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 7th - Local naval authorities did not comment on the rumors circulating in New York that Japanese warships are patrolling in the area between Taiwan and northern Luzon, saying that they have not received any information about this rumor.</p>
<p>Japanese Offensive Could Erupt at Any Time, Washington Pays Attention to Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>International News Agency, Washington, 7th - The government continued to pay attention to the special military preparations in the Far East yesterday. Authoritative sources admitted that a new Japanese aggression could erupt at any time. US-Japan negotiations are now at a standstill. Subsequent negotiation actions still depend on Japan. In his note to Japan on November 26, Secretary of State Hull reiterated his willingness to resolve the current differences on the Pacific issue based on basic principles. Tokyo must first agree to this note before negotiations can be reopened. Well-informed sources believe that Washington may receive Japan's reply in the middle of next week, but there is no indication that Tokyo is prepared to accept the conditions set by the United States. At the same time, the seven major developments that have occurred in the Far East in the past few days have caused Washington to re-enter a state of tension and alert. These seven major developments are: According to reports from various Australian radar stations, more and more Japanese army detachments are entering Vietnam; Singapore has canceled all leaves for army and navy soldiers; Philippine President Quezon has formulated an emergency plan for the Philippine government; US Far East Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General MacArthur is still consulting with President Quezon on the defense of the Philippine Islands; Singapore's new authorities strictly control non-British residents and do not allow them to leave Malaya; Japan is accelerating the evacuation of its expatriates from Hong Kong, Malaya, Borneo, and Singapore; and Australia has guaranteed assistance if the Dutch East Indies are attacked. At the same time, the Melbourne Herald reported yesterday that the Australian government "is consulting with the ABCD countries on everything in anticipation of war in the Pacific."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th - Reuters special correspondent says that the public generally recognizes Japan's reply on Vietnam as a delaying tactic, intending to wait and see the results of the Soviet and Libyan wars to determine its next move. If the German army wins, Japan will advance its aggression plan. The Washington Times pointed out that the pretext in Japan's reply, saying that Japan has clearly included Thailand in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and considering all the circumstances, the Japanese are preparing to seize Thailand in the process of their conquest of Asia. However, the ABCD countries, in view of the threatening position created by Japan in Vietnam, will not slacken their preparations.</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister Obtains Full Power to Prepare for All Contingencies</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 7th - Thai Prime Minister Songgram has become the de facto dictator of Thailand because the Thai parliament passed an emergency legislation bill yesterday. According to local radio, the bill grants the Thai Prime Minister absolute full power for a period of twelve months. The Thai Prime Minister may take special steps to crack down on the Fifth Column and completely control all transportation. The Thai government issued a statement last night, asking the public to assist the government in a new plan to protect national security. Strikes are not allowed in important industries, and the actions of foreigners must be regulated.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 7th - Bangkok newspapers all published Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's guarantee to the US President that the Japanese troops in Vietnam do not pose a threat to Thailand, but did not criticize it. Neutral observers said that the Thai government should continue to actively carry out its preparations and closely monitor developments in the Far East without the slightest slackening. At the same time, the general Thai public now has a tendency to temporarily forget politics and prepare to hold a three-day celebration to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the establishment of constitutional government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 7th - A Reuters special correspondent claims that the situation has undoubtedly become serious after news broke that a large number of Japanese warships have passed the southern tip of Vietnam (about 300 miles from the Malay coast) and are now sailing northwest towards Bangkok. We may speculate that the recall of British naval and other soldiers on Saturday night was probably due to this. At this time, a large number of warships from countries with tense relations, such as Britain, the United States, and Japan, began to patrol and cruise in each other's areas, inevitably risking a conflagration. Local officials do not underestimate the importance of recent developments in Singapore, but believe that conflict may still be avoided and are making various efforts to prevent excessive pessimism. President Roosevelt's direct appeal to the Japanese Emperor has aroused the hope of the general public, believing that the wise advice may gain an advantage in Japan and stop the current dangerous developments in the Far East from advancing.</p>
<p>Democratic Countries Gather Large Armies to Prepare for Far Eastern Contingencies</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 7th - Rangoon responsible officials commented on the recent developments in the Far Eastern situation, saying that the Far Eastern situation has now returned to the original state of the past few decades, that is, Japan must decide between war and peace. Japan's policies and actions have led to the gathering of large armies in the Pacific region, and this army has had sufficient time to mobilize due to Japan's indecision. If Japan completes its means according to the Axis countries' habits, everyone is prepared to deal with it. They are unwilling to negotiate with Japan until it is defeated. At that time, Japan will undoubtedly fall to an insignificant position. Japan's future is currently in the hands of its people and steady leaders. They can still rise up to save the country at this last moment.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 7th - According to the Amendment to the Burma National Defense Ordinance established today, the Burmese government has been empowered to conscript the manpower of the entire country to deal with any real or potential attack, or to facilitate the activities of the British army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 7th - Burmese newspapers commented on Japan's policies in the past three weeks, saying that its purpose is to find out how to continue to advance without causing war against Britain and the United States. Then Japan can break the ABCD line, and Tokyo will boldly move forward. However, the British and Americans have now realized this purpose of Japan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 7th - Semi-official sources said that Japan's reply to the US President's inquiry is tantamount to an insult to the American people, and its true intention is undoubtedly to express its unwillingness to give up aggression and to launch it when military preparations are completed. Now that Japan has completely occupied Vietnam, it is difficult for Vichy to prove anything unfavorable to Japan, and Japan's statement that the Chinese army threatened Vietnam cannot hide Japan's ambition to seize other territories.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Actively Prepares for the Pacific Situation and Will Never Slacken</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 7th - The recent developments in Washington have not caused the Dutch East Indies to continue to adopt more ambitious plans. Although responsible spokespersons said yesterday that the various contradictory messages from Washington yesterday have confirmed the crisis in the Dutch East Indies, that is, the idea that preparations must not be slackened at the moment, but the local area still maintains a calm attitude on the surface. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies went to the countryside to spend the weekend, but still frequently contacted the authorities. Although the administrative agencies do not work on weekends, many people did not go to the mountains for rest, in case of unexpected events. Officials are still paying close attention to the Japanese air route from Palau to Portuguese Timor to prevent the Japanese from occupying Timor. If the Washington talks break down, the threats to the rear of the Dutch East Indies must be closely watched. Dutch East Indies officials are unwilling to express their opinions on the Japanese air route, nor are they willing to discuss whether the activities of Japanese seaplanes are limited to non-land sea areas, but admit that once war breaks out, this issue must be resolved urgently.</p>
<h3>To Cope with the Serious Situation, the United States Must Build a Two-Ocean Navy, Secretary of the Navy Knox Submits a Report to the President</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 7th - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox stated in his annual report to President Roosevelt, which was published yesterday, that the United States has encountered an extremely dangerous international situation, so that it must build a two-ocean navy to defend against possible invasions by allied countries. "Colonel Knox stated in his report that the bases obtained by the United States from the United Kingdom are essential to the protection of the Western Hemisphere." The report also stated, "The United States has become the world's largest naval power because it wants to create the largest naval expansion program in world history." He proposed a total of 325 warships, 2,059 new aircraft, and extended the naval bases in the two oceans, with the number of soldiers increasing from 162,64 to 1,13,962. Regarding joint exercises in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, Knox said, "The new joint program has been completed." He said that large fleet demonstration operations will not be carried out this year, because warships are stationed in the theater, waiting to respond to any emergency. They cannot be concentrated in one place to disrupt the war line. Knox also said that the Pacific, Atlantic, and Asian fleets have been reorganized to protect American interests.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Move Towards the Vietnamese Coast</h3>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 7th - Local officials announced today that British reconnaissance aircraft have confirmed that many warships are moving near the Vietnamese coast. (The communique did not specify the nationality of the warships, but authoritative sources said that these warships can only be Japanese warships.)</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes at the Japanese Embassy in the United States</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 7th - The Japanese Embassy in the United States recently announced that First Secretary Terashima and Third Secretary Takagi will be transferred to Brazil and Chile respectively. Embassy officials Inogawa and Fujiyama will be transferred back to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. In addition, three diplomats will be transferred to the embassy from Tokyo, Shanghai, and Panama respectively. There is no special significance to these personnel changes.</p>
<h3>Gunfire in this City This Morning</h3>
<p>At about 4:30 this morning, gunshots suddenly came from the east of the Huangpu River. For about a quarter of an hour, black smoke rose in the sky, mixed with the sound of aircraft. Many residents were awakened from their dreams. Details were not clear as of press time.</p>

<h3>Red Army Situation Improves Further, Gaining the Initiative on All Fronts</h3>
<p>The Kalinin Front Crosses the Volga River to Attack, and the German Offensive in the Mozhaisk Region is Repelled</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 7th - A special correspondent for Pravda in the central region said, "Yesterday, the severe frost of the 12th (27 degrees below zero) won the first victory. In the evening, our army discovered the corpses of German soldiers who had been frozen to death. They were not killed by Soviet bullets, but frozen to death by the severe frost." The wind was even stronger in the evening, and the fighting near Moscow was even more fierce. The war situation on the central lines is recorded as follows: In the Klin area, our army broke into Town Y, and in the connecting area, our army also occupied several villages, forcing the enemy to retreat. Our army's offensive in the north of Klin is also continuing to develop. The German army stubbornly resisted, trying to seize the initiative, but its counterattacks were repelled. The German army has increased by four divisions, including one tank division, one motorized division, and two infantry divisions. The fighting in Volokolamsk is extremely fierce. The German army even used the 106th Infantry Division and the 2nd Tank Division to participate in the battle for Point P. The intensity of the fighting can be seen from this. Yesterday, our army occupied several villages along the Volokolamsk highway. In the Mozhaisk area, the German army's repeated offensives were repelled. One battalion of infantry was encircled and annihilated in Village M. In the Naro-Fominsk area, our army won a complete victory. The German army retreated and fled, abandoning thousands of corpses and countless military equipment along the way. At this point, the German army's offensive in this area has completely failed. In the Stalinogorsk area, the Pirovo Guards Cavalry Division continued to advance, and the German army abandoned its positions and retreated south. The situation in Tula is still serious. The enemy has appeared on the Tula-Moscow highway and occupied several villages. In short, on the main money roads in the central region, our army has gained the initiative yesterday. The German army was forced to take the defensive. Our army's counterattack force is extremely strong. Even in the Volokolamsk area, our army's division of Rokossovsky has wiped out 10,224 enemies in seven days, destroyed 139 tanks, 91 artillery pieces, 139 military vehicles, and many other military equipment.</p>
<p>The Kalinin Soviets Launch an Offensive, Capturing Many Important Strongholds</p>
<p>TASS, Kalinin, 7th - In the past few days, the Kalinin front has been quiet. The activities of both sides are limited to opening scarce artillery fire and reconnaissance. The enemy is hiding from the cold in densely populated areas, trying to start an active offensive with scattered and disorganized artillery fire. On December 5, after our army advanced its positions and secretly reorganized its troops, it began a new offensive. At three o'clock in the morning, the vanguard infantry team crossed the frozen Volga River at the same time and occupied an attack base on its south bank. Fierce fighting then broke out in the Budonsaya-Popovka area. At the same time, our other teams also occupied two important locations on the south bank. At 11:00 a.m., our army occupied a position in the northwest of Kalinin and launched an offensive. An hour and a half later, a group of our army broke into the German defense line and occupied the outskirts of Village K. The army is currently engaged in a stubborn battle in the north of Kalinin. At 1:00 p.m., our army launched an offensive in the southeast of Kalinin. In the afternoon, our army occupied another important location. On the evening of December 5, our army reached the Leningrad Avenue in several locations, forcing the enemy to retreat. The enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>German Troops Withdraw from Taganrog, Leaving Behind a Large Number of Military Supplies and Objects</p>
<p>TASS, Southern Front, 7th - The 56th Army, commanded by Remizov, continued its offensive. The German army used infantry and tank teams to fight against Remizov's troops in order to preserve its military strength and resources. The enemy air force also tried to cover its retreat with concentrated strikes, but all were ineffective. Our army has reached the plains of the Taganrog Isthmus. The Don-Kuban and Terek Cossack cavalry teams came out to stop the fleeing enemy. The Germans hastily withdrew from Taganrog, leaving behind a large number of military supplies and objects. The outskirts of the city were filled with trucks. Our air force is giving the enemy a heavy blow along this road.</p>
<p>The Soviets Fiercely Strike Attacking German Troops in Sevastopol</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 7th - Newspapers published an article by Rear Admiral Zhukov on the defense of Sevastopol, stating that fierce fighting has been going on at the entrance to Western Sevastopol for a month, but the Germans have not made further progress. The Red Army troops and the Black Sea Fleet bravely defended, destroying the German army's manpower. In a month of war, the Germans have suffered countless thousands of casualties. The German 72nd Infantry Division suffered particularly heavy losses. According to prisoners Hoffmann and Möller, there were only fifty or sixty soldiers left in each of their transports. Typhoid fever is prevalent. The Germans have also suffered heavy losses in resources. 131 German aircraft and the largest artillery, small artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles have been destroyed. Our army built a strong defense in Sevastopol and launched brave counterattacks to exhaust the enemy. The Germans could not support it and have taken the defensive in some places. The Crimean guerrillas provided great assistance to the regular army. They engaged in sabotage work in the enemy's rear, cut off their transportation lines, destroyed their manpower, blew up their bridges, and burned their ammunition depots. All the people of Sevastopol have risen up to defend the city. The factory has reorganized its work to adapt to the needs of the war, producing various needed items.</p>

<h3>Tibetan Representatives to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Tibetan representatives Lobsang Tashi and two others arrived in Chongqing yesterday and will soon pay respects to Chairman Chiang, present respectful documents and gifts from Tibet, and report on the current situation in Tibet. Since the founding of the Republic of China, this is the third time Tibet has sent representatives, the first time being in 1930 and the second in 1935. According to Lobsang Tashi, Wu Zhongxin's appointment to Tibet last year to preside over the Dalai Lama's enthronement ceremony left a very deep impression on the Tibetan people, who immediately decided to send representatives to the central government to pay respects and express gratitude. Tibet is currently peaceful. The location of the reincarnated Panchen Lama has not yet been confirmed. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>If Japan Invades Yunnan via Vietnam, Strong Resistance Will Be Met</h3>
<p>China Implements Various Precautions in Southern Guangxi; Traffic from Longzhou to Vietnam Destroyed</p>
<p>Guilin – Whether Japan invades Thailand or attacks the Burma Road and the southwestern provinces of China, especially Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, will once again attract the attention of the world. There is no doubt that China will offer strong resistance. According to a foreign military observer who recently traveled to the southern border of Yunnan Province, an attack on Yunnan Province from Vietnam would be extremely difficult if any resistance is encountered, and the occurrence of such resistance is beyond doubt. Chinese military authorities are currently implementing various precautions in southern Guangxi Province. The transportation lines from Longzhou to Vietnam have been systematically destroyed. The evacuation of residents in the Nanning area is also underway. In the past few days, Japanese aircraft have been active in bombing Chinese military positions along the West River and North River fronts in northern Guangdong, with the apparent intention of dispersing the concentration of Chinese forces to prevent possible Chinese offensives that would prevent the Japanese army from retreating. Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi's remarks to foreign reporters that Chinese forces would attack Vietnam if Japan invaded Thailand and Burma are credible for some reason. It is said that British and American military observers who recently inspected the defenses of Chinese forces in the southwest provinces expressed satisfaction with China's determination to offer strong resistance should the Japanese attempt to invade Yunnan via Vietnam.

Moreover, this time, the solicitation method was completely adopted, so it can be widely popularized among the people. Even rickshaw pullers and maids are proud to buy bonds. This is not only sufficient to strengthen wartime economic strength, but also rich in propaganda and educational significance. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Peace or War Between the US and Japan</h3>
<p>The Japanese response to the US regarding the issue of increased troop deployments in Vietnam, delivered on the 6th of this month, is generally regarded as providing explanations that the US cannot possibly agree with or accept. At the same time, the US State Department officially announced that 125,000 Japanese troops have gathered in Vietnam, three-quarters of whom are in southern Vietnam, and that two large transport fleets are sailing towards the Gulf of Siam, planning to hold naval demonstrations there. Although the US authorities have not yet formally refuted the Japanese reply, the aforementioned news released by the State Department is tantamount to exposing the claims in the Japanese reply that the number of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam does not exceed the number stipulated in the Franco-Japanese agreement and that the Japanese troops sent to Vietnam are to prevent the threat of Chinese troops, both of which are completely untrue. If the Japanese side intends to evade the important points and perfunctorily deal with the US in this reply, then the result is sufficient to show its lack of sincerity in the negotiations with the US, and further aggravates the stimulation to the US. Therefore, even though the Japanese side is still carefully studying the US ultimatum of the 26th of last month and has been slow to respond, no one dares to expect an optimistic future; given the fundamentally different positions of the two sides, and the imminent crisis of the confrontation of large armies, if it is said that Japan's future reply to the US will be contrary to what it is currently expressing in actions and words, and has the power to turn the tide, and can transform a bad situation into a good one at once, this is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Hull said yesterday when hosting the press that the US-Japan talks are expected to continue, and said that there have been no major changes in the Far East situation in the past 48 hours: optimistic views can of course believe that the US will not stop the talks abruptly because the Japanese response to the increase in troop deployments in Vietnam is not satisfactory, because the hope of a one in a million chance for the future has not been cut off. However, in fact, the current situation has deteriorated even more than before the US question was raised on the 2nd of this month. Comparing the Japanese reply with its actions in Vietnam, it is sufficient to illustrate that it is carrying out a very bad two-faced policy towards the US—using self-defense as a cover for offensive deployments—it would not be an exaggeration to say that the question was fruitless. And President Roosevelt's letter to the Japanese Emperor at this juncture is a very extraordinary move, and the last effort of the US authorities to save the Pacific crisis. In the Far East situation, where tension has reached its extreme, there will inevitably be considerable excitement. Now the content of the letter has not been disclosed, but it is not difficult to imagine; it is intended that President Roosevelt will certainly hope that Japan, with its consistent compassion, will know its way back, in order to avoid the unfortunate outbreak of the Pacific War; as for the fundamental views held by the US on this, it has been stated many times over the years, especially since the issuance of the Hull Note, and there is a final explanation in the ultimatum sent to Japan on the 26th of last month, the Japanese side must have heard it thoroughly, and whether or not Mr. Roosevelt touched on it in this letter is not important in comparison. The negotiations in Washington are already impossible to discuss further before the official reply from the Japanese side is submitted, and the Japanese reply to this ultimatum is just like what this newspaper pointed out in yesterday's editorial: hesitating between peace and war, showing that its color is fierce, and its spirit is already discouraged! However, the Japanese government is difficult to follow the usual political path to stop on the edge of the cliff due to the accumulation of difficulties, then in the helplessness, it directly appealed this problem to the Japanese Emperor, which may possibly obtain the effect that cannot be obtained through general diplomatic channels. It is expected that the original intention of President Roosevelt's letter to the Japanese Emperor this time is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation in Japan, it is harmful and without benefit to act willfully in this way. As for China, it is worried that it has no way to win, let alone deal with the sum of ABCD's strength in the Far East. Fiery words are only enough to increase its own false arrogance, and do nothing to remedy its scarce national strength. In the past ten years, there have also been opportunities that have benefited Japan's expansion, and the highest peak was when Britain and France were defeated on the Western Front last summer; however, since then, the situation of the axis of aggression has deteriorated day by day, and the prestige of the democratic camp has been revived. As of today, this weight has been absolutely tilted towards the anti-aggression camp. Europe and Africa are like this, and the Far East is even more so. Japan was not enough to achieve anything in the previous golden age, let alone in today's day when aggression has reached its end? However, in Japan, the development of its expansion demands is not entirely in line with the international situation. The determination to advance southward and build a "high-level national defense" were both prompted by the Nazi victory last summer. In terms of the time factor, it can only catch up with the back of the Nazi victory, and as for the completion of the configuration and preparation for action, the situation has changed completely, the Nazi prestige has become a thing of the past, and the democratic camp is also more prepared. Judging only from the situation, if it takes risks, it is difficult to achieve its purpose. However, on the other hand, the promotion of speeches and the promotion of mobilization for more than a year have internally become like riding a tiger, and retreating will be difficult to explain. This contradiction is shrouding the Japanese political situation, forming a large source of distress for the authorities. Recently, the war situation of the German army invading the Soviet Union has become more and more unfavorable, and the contingency preparations of Britain and the United States in the Far East have become stronger than before, and it is still not enough to make Japan's attitude towards the Far East crisis have a decisive impact. This is not the excessive stubbornness of some people, but the accumulation of bad results caused in the past, which cannot be done by ordinary people, and this is also not what can be expected of the current regime under the control of radical soldiers and their expeditionary soldiers. If the wishes of the United States can really be implemented, then the resolute young military leader Tojo is more suitable than anyone to make this decision. If the current Japanese authorities are unable to do so, then this letter from Roosevelt is also difficult to expect greater success.</p>
<p>The development of history is sometimes completely separated from the considerations and will of those involved. Whether the Pacific crisis can escape this convention is now at the final juncture, and delaying it is just in vain. It is expected that the unveiling of this mystery of peace or war will not be far away.</p>
<h3>US Relations with Finland, Romania, and Hungary Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Canada and New Zealand Follow Mother Country in Declaring War on the Three Countries; US Navy Orders Seizure of Finnish Merchant Ships in the US</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 7th – Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that although Britain declared war on Finland, Romania, and Hungary because the three allies of Germany did not stop fighting against the Soviet Union, the United States' relations with the three countries will remain unchanged. Finland's envoy to the US, Procope, recently met with Under Secretary of State Welles to discuss the relationship between Finland and the US following the emergence of a new front in Europe. Authorities here said that the US will discuss possible steps to be taken with Finland, Romania, and Hungary after Britain's declaration of war. The declaration of war by Britain does not come as a surprise here. The US is currently considering its relations with the three countries in detail, but has made no statement on what steps it will take in the near future. Some officials believe that if Germany allows it, Finland still hopes to stop attacking the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – The deadline for the British note to Finland, Romania, and Hungary expired last night, and neither Romania nor Hungary responded. Although Finland replied, it was not satisfactory, so Britain is now at war with the three countries. According to the British note to Finland, please Finland stop the war against the Soviet Union according to its previous statement that it only wanted to recover the lost territory and had no intention of aggression.</p>
<p>Havas, Hungarian Capital, 6th – The US envoy to Hungary visited Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Teleki tonight to hand over the note from the British government announcing that the two countries were in a state of war.</p>
<p>Havas, Canadian Federal Capital, 7th – Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently said that the Canadian Federation is in a state of war with Finland, Romania, and Hungary from 4:00 PM today. The Federal government fully believes that the residents and naturalized foreigners within the territory will be able to attach themselves to the Canadian Federation and support the democratic primary period, so the government does not intend to take any measures to restrict the freedom of the expatriates of the above three countries.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 7th – It is learned that the US Navy Department has recently issued an order to place all Finnish transport ships in US ports under guard for protection.</p>

The US represents the self-governing territory of New Zealand in sending the note, and represents Britain in sending the final ultimatum, only as a forwarding agency.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 6th – It is learned that the Finnish envoy to Britain, Gripenberg, plans to leave Britain and return to his country within the next week. Gripenberg has been the envoy to Britain since 1932.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 6th – Political figures here are not surprised by Britain's declaration of war on Finland, Hungary, and Romania. It is said that this move by Britain has no impact on the current war situation. The Italian newspapers all said that the firm responses of Finland, Hungary, and Romania to Britain further prove that European countries are united in fighting against Britain.</p>
<p>Havas, Romanian Capital, 6th – Romania has not yet formally declared a state of war with Britain. The government will issue a bulletin tonight to explain its attitude. The radio stations and newspapers here are still holding silence on this matter, but the discussion world is very clear about the development of this matter. The general public believes that since Britain is thousands of miles away from Romania, it will not be able to invade for a while, and even if it bombs by air, it is at least impossible in winter. Informed sources said that Britain's declaration of war on Romania is only a gesture, so the Romanian government still trusts its German allies and is determined to continue to promote the axis policy.</p>
<h3>Britain Convenes Economic Conference in Singapore</h3>
<p>To be Chaired by Cooper</p>

The enemy's transport and tank fleets were scattered, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. More than 7,500 enemy soldiers were captured, not counting those captured on the front lines. The air force, despite encountering storms, still controls the air, destroying 21 enemy planes during Friday's engagement, while losing only six. The British army captured a lot, and everything that could not be transported to the rear was destroyed. The most useful thing the British captured was 50,000 gallons of gasoline, 10,000 gallons of which was diesel used specifically for Italian tanks and trucks to operate. Yesterday the weather was clear, but there was no news of major armored forces engaging in combat, only that five enemy tanks were destroyed.</p>
<h3>US Increases Relations with Middle Eastern Countries</h3>
<p>Havas, Turkish Capital, 6th – According to political commentators here, American diplomacy in the Near East has been very active in recent weeks, seeking to strengthen political and economic relations with countries in the Near East.

<h3>China Boy Scouts Association Establishes Honorary Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>Appointing Zhang Boling and Others as Committee Members</p>
<p>Chongqing: Boy Scout training is the most comprehensive form of life education for cultivating righteousness and developing well-rounded individuals.

<p>Random Notes on the European War</p>
<h3>Germany Two Years into the War</h3>
<p>They are still the first brave sons of this village to sacrifice for the country in the entire war. Now, the massacre in the East has made many German families deeply feel the pain of separation and death between fathers and sons, brothers, and husbands and wives. If the United States actively participates in the war, I believe it will have a very negative impact on German morale.</p>
<p>Germans have begun to show a sign that, regardless of who wins the war, regardless of what kind of politician succeeds Hitler, they will inevitably carry some mud and earthiness from pulling themselves out of the Nazi mire. It will not be easy to completely eliminate the traces of the anti-Semitic movement. It will also be difficult to smoothly implement democratic governance, requiring at least a considerable period. And to make Germans live in an environment where everything is stipulated by law without achievement will not be easy.</p>
<p>Berliners often carefully count the standing spaces on buses. The regulations state that only thirteen people are allowed to stand. If there are already thirteen people standing, even if there is plenty of space in the car to accommodate ten more, they would rather wait for the next bus.</p>
<p>Once, I was on a bus that suddenly stopped because of a red light ahead. A man got on from the back, and immediately a boy of about thirteen or fourteen in shorts jumped down and grabbed his clothes, saying, "This is not a bus stop, hurry back on the bus." The man initially looked at him in confusion, but seeing his serious expression, he said, "Let go quickly, or I will..." By this time, the bus was already moving, and the boy was still dragging the man. Seeing that he couldn't move him, he jumped back on the bus in the last second, looking at the passenger standing below and saying indignantly, "This is not a bus stop, this is not a bus stop."</p>
<p>Real news no longer "flows out" from Germany, but only "drips out." Most foreign journalists have left Germany, and those who remain feel restricted due to increasingly strict censorship. Lately, the news that drips out is even more scarce, with only a few pieces coming through every few days. Although the 118 American diplomats and consuls who recently returned home by ship were ordered by the State Department to remain silent, they still revealed the following points about the situation inside Germany:</p>
<p>British bombing is proving very effective, not only in Hamburg but also in Cologne. Tens of thousands of women and children have been evacuated from Hamburg, and hardly any ships can be seen in the harbor. The Cologne Cathedral stands among the ruins. The city center has been reduced to a pile of rubble. Terrified residents crowd into huge air-raid shelters under public squares at night.</p>
<p>Germans are increasingly anxious about the Eastern Front war. Approximately 20,000 wounded soldiers are sent back from the front lines every week (not including those killed or captured). German steel production fell to 28,150,000 tons in 1940, a decrease of 1,467,000 tons (US steel production in 1940 totaled 66,993,000 tons).</p>
<p>The Nazi Party's official newspaper, "The Blackshirt," published the following shocking news: "If the German war against Russia is seen as an attempt to liberate Europe from the forces of Bolshevism, this is absolutely wrong. We are not fighting Russia to preserve culture, preserve civilization, or preserve democracy, but only to preserve Germany." (The End)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Requests Authority from Consular Body, Sets Deadline for Rice Hoarders to Sell</h3>
<p>Requests an additional clause to the Land Regulations to Thoroughly Control Prices in the City. Only Two American Ships Turn Back, Other Ships Still Head to Shanghai</p>
<p>At a time when the authorities of the two concessions are gradually achieving results in managing prices, British and American ships suddenly stopped sailing to Shanghai due to the tense international situation, causing the city's external transportation to feel the lack of ships. The Municipal Council has obtained foreign exchange from the Price Stabilization Fund for the import of various essential goods. In addition to deciding to ensure the existing materials in the two concessions and prohibiting the smuggling of flour and other goods out of the country, the Transportation Committee has chartered a ship from Shanghai Zengli Company and is fully utilizing the Municipal Council's priority in using third-country ships to clear cargo transport. Furthermore, to stabilize prices, they hope that merchants will sell their stockpiled goods at the fixed price.</p>
<p>Requesting Authority to Crack Down on Stockpiles</p>
<p>For example, the foreign rice stored within the concessions, regardless of quality, should all be purchased by the Municipal Council at a fixed price of 130 yuan per shi (unit of volume) and distributed to rice shops throughout the city for retail. However, due to inappropriate prices, in recent days, some merchants who only seek profit and disregard the overall situation have refused to sell their stockpiles, making the future of price management difficult. In light of this, the Municipal Council, in order to have a legal basis for managing prices and to have the power to crack down on those who refuse to sell their stockpiles, decided to add a new clause to the Land Regulations, following the precedent of the 53rd clause of the newly attached regulations promulgated last time. According to information obtained by the Dachong News Agency from foreigners yesterday, this application has been submitted to Consul General Hill. Once permission is obtained from the consular body, it can be announced to thoroughly manage prices in the city in both fundamental and superficial ways.</p>
<p>Two American Cargo Ships Temporarily Return</p>
<p>An official from the American President Lines revealed that two American cargo ships, carrying goods from the United States, originally scheduled to come to Shanghai via Honolulu and the Philippines, have now unloaded their cargo in Manila. These two ships, the Sea Witch and the American Leader, are owned by the American Pioneer Line and operated by the American President Lines. They arrived in Manila several days ago and, after unloading their cargo, will cancel their voyage to Shanghai and return directly to the United States. Other American ships originally scheduled to sail to Shanghai will not be diverted to Manila. As for the President Madison and President Harrison, which carried American troops from Shanghai at the end of last month, both have arrived in Manila. The President Harrison will remain docked there, while the President Madison will sail to Singapore and will soon return to the Philippines before heading back to the United States.</p>
<p>Other Ships Still Come to Shanghai as Usual</p>
<p>The President Lines has no indication of coming to Shanghai in the near future. The American citizens in this city who took the French ship D'Artagnan to Manila in mid-month are expected to arrive there around December 20th and may all transfer to the President Madison to return to the United States. It is also confirmed that several Panamanian ships have recently arrived in Shanghai, including the Flomar and the Bojaca. The latter, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai with coal from Sumatra. Mail from Shanghai to the United States is expected to be carried by the D'Artagnan to Manila and then transferred to President Lines ships for transport to the United States. The French Postal Company cargo ship Chaffee, which carried the last batch of mail to the United States, left Shanghai on December 4th for Manila, with its final destination being Saigon.</p>
<p>Bureau Rice to Be Put on Sale Again</p>
<p>In order to adjust the supply of rice within the two concessions, the authorities have specifically decided that starting today, rice shops that need to purchase rice for retail can register with Liki Yoko on Sichuan Road if they are in the Public Concession. The procedures are the same as for selling Municipal Council foreign rice. If they are in the French Concession, they can register with nearby police stations. After approval, they can pay and pick up the goods. This rice is drawn from the more than 600,000 bags of foreign rice stored in the city's grain and bean rice industries. The Municipal Council's small-sized foreign rice will resume sales on the 10th of this month. Furthermore, yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions further reduced the amount sold per purchase to five sheng (eight market catties) in order to prevent the hoarding of rice. Some ignorant civilians mistakenly believed that this was a sign of a shortage of reserves within the concessions and rushed to buy rice from various rice shops, causing more congestion than usual. Several cases of carrying rice exceeding the limit were detained in one day.</p>
<p>Fair Distribution of Food Will Only Be Implemented When Necessary</p>
<p>As for the plan to search for food based on the number of people, it is still under consideration by the concession authorities and will only be carried out if the future situation deems it necessary. According to authoritative sources, there is no need to worry about a food shortage within the concessions. There is no accurate figure for the amount of grain stored within the concessions, but the recently rumored 2.2 million bags is a close approximation. The monthly consumption is about 250,000 bags. The authorities have also obtained a comprehensive plan for importing foreign rice and flour into Shanghai, and this plan has been agreed upon and assisted by the authorities of all countries. Furthermore, the Municipal Council has priority in loading any merchant ships arriving in Shanghai. The highest authorities in the concessions have also formulated concrete plans to ensure that the residents' food will continue to be supplied by the Municipal Council. Even if the Pacific War breaks out, the merchant ships leased by the Municipal Council to load supplies for the Shanghai concessions will be able to pass through in any situation. The Municipal Council's restriction on the purchase of rice to half a dou is not because the Municipal Council feels there is a shortage, but because the consumption of bureau rice exceeds what residents need, as unscrupulous individuals are still using small-scale purchases of bureau rice to hoard it.</p>
<h3>British Company, Xiangtai Lumber, Announces Closure</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Employees Laid Off</p>
<p>According to Dachong News Agency, Xiangtai Lumber, a British company and the largest sawmill in this port, has temporarily suspended operations due to difficulties in sourcing and transporting timber. The factory ceased operations yesterday, and all employees, numbering over a thousand, have been laid off with compensation. The factory has been operating in Shanghai for more than thirty years. Before the war, it had branches in Fuzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, and other places, all of which were closed after the war, resulting in significant losses. However, the prosperous business of the Shanghai headquarters was sufficient to compensate for the losses. Recently, due to the tense situation in the Far East, the Shanghai headquarters was also unable to sustain operations and closed down.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Mutual Transport Between Wholesale Flour Merchants</h3>
<p>Some Transfers Occurred Eighteen Times, How Can Flour Prices Not Rise?</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has completed the registration of flour stocks in this port and is now moving towards controlling individual needs. It has intensified the implementation of transport restrictions since the day before yesterday and prohibits middlemen from profiting from it. It is said that a batch of goods has been transferred through eighteen middlemen, with the final consumers paying a huge price. According to official sources, starting yesterday, those who apply to transport flour must declare their destination and will only be granted a transport permit after a strict investigation by the Municipal Council. This will prevent hoarding. In the future, the Municipal Council will only issue transport permits for transport from importers to wholesalers, or from wholesalers to retailers. Mutual transport between wholesalers will be strictly prohibited in order to reduce their profit-taking through multiple transfers and additional permit fees. It is widely believed that this measure will reduce flour prices.</p>
<h3>Manager of French Shipping Company Suddenly Arrested in Saigon</h3>
<p>Vichy Claims He Leaked Confidential Information, Rumors That Several Ships Supplied Japanese Warships with Crude Oil</p>
<p>According to a recent visitor from Vietnam, the news of the arrest of Mr. Bascali, the manager of the French Mail Ship Company in Vietnam, in Saigon has greatly shocked Vietnam and the local shipping industry. It is rumored that Mr. Corchie, the Far East general agent of the French Mail Ship Company, set off on the Chaffee several days ago to Vietnam, where he will also serve as the manager of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Mr. Bascali is 45 years old and has lived in Saigon for many years with wide social connections. It is said that recently, after the Japanese army entered Vietnam, he reported in detail to the company headquarters in his home country the difficulties encountered by the French Mail Ship Company in Vietnam, which led to his detention. The reason for the arrest ordered by Vichy was that Mr. Bascali sent out confidential information in an inappropriate manner, causing the information to fall into the hands of unauthorized persons. The visitor also said that there were widespread rumors in Vietnam that a certain ship's</p>
<p>Senior Crew Member</p>
<p>had recently told a friend that he had heard Singapore Radio broadcasting that several ships sailing between Manila and Vietnam were supplying Japanese warships between Manila and Saigon with crude oil. The friend, upon hearing this, passed it on, causing the crew member to be forced to apologize.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Shoe Stores, Negotiations Close to Agreement</h3>
<p>Wages Increased by 150%, Business Has Already Resumed</p>
<p>Over 500 shoe stores on Zhejiang Road, Daxin Street, Xinza Road, and Avenue Foch in this city, employing about 6,000 workers, declared a joint strike starting at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday due to dire living conditions and unsuccessful requests for wage increases from employers. All shoe stores were unable to operate and temporarily closed. It is now learned that representatives from both labor and management have met several times, and their opinions are gradually converging. The employers have agreed to increase wages by 150%, with cloth shoes earning a profit of 4 fen per pair and leather shoes earning 1 fen per yuan. It is reported that labor representatives are collecting opinions, and it is expected that the labor dispute in this industry can be resolved satisfactorily in the near future. All shoe stores resumed business yesterday, with employers sending staff to receive customers.</p>
<h3>Several Foreign Firms Announce One-Shift Work System</h3>
<p>Due to the recent reduction in economic conditions and oil supply in this city, several commercial firms in this city have announced shortened working hours in order to reduce the number of times employees go to the office each day, thereby saving gasoline. Hua Lun Foreign Firm announced that the office hours have been changed to 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and on Sundays from 8:30 a.m. to noon. The office hours of Java Company have been changed to 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The office hours of Laili Foreign Firm and Paijia Foreign Firm have been changed to 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and they are closed on Saturdays. It is reported that several other large commercial firms will also adopt shorter working hours soon. Although the times are different, there is a general trend of reducing the number of times employees go to the office each day.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Catholic Service Group's Donation of Clothes and Rice to the Poor as Christmas Gifts</h3>
<p>— Gui</p>
<p>The Catholic Service Group distributed clothes and rice to nearby refugees and the poor at the Jinke Elementary School at 734 Jiaozhou Road at 2 p.m. yesterday, invited them to bread, and had performances of speeches and songs. I have participated in charitable gatherings many times, and I feel that the warmth and joy of this event is unprecedented. I will record the process as follows.</p>
<p>The Catholic Service Group is a social service organization organized by Catholic believers. The president is Ms. Lu Zengzuo. Her father, Mr. Lu Bohong, was the most famous Catholic in China during his lifetime and was awarded a robe and sword by the Roman Curia. Ms. Lu has just returned from a weary trip to Europe and is very capable of carrying on her predecessor's legacy and devoting herself to social services. The group always has a tradition of giving clothes to the poor every Christmas, which has never been interrupted since 1936. Yesterday, more than one hundred sets of simple clothes and several bags of rice were given. The cotton clothes were all made by the female members of the group in their spare time, so their meaning cannot be compared with ordinary clothing donations.</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m., the poor, guests, and members gathered in the playground of Jinke Elementary School. Fortunately, the warm sun was in the sky. Although it was winter, there was no cold feeling. Dozens of rows of benches were placed in the playground, some for the poor to sit on, and some for the guest seats. There were old and young, women and children among the poor, and there were several blind people embellishing them with poles; they were seated in an orderly manner, just like students listening to a lecture. The clothes and rice were placed on several long tables, numbered, ready for distribution. First, Father Xu of the Catholic Leisi Church gave a speech, with many words of encouragement; then, Ms. Lu Zengzuo gave a speech, the general idea being that we should regard service as our vocation, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. This year, due to soaring prices and limited economic capacity, the amount that can be donated is not much, but I hope that the work and effect next year will be ten times that of today.</p>
<p>After the speech, the students of Jinke Elementary School performed, including two programs of children's expressive songs and short dramas. The female student who played the poor child in the short drama had a lifelike expression and a sad singing voice. At first glance, it was almost suspected that she was one of the participating poor people. Later, Father Xu and the members of the group gave the clothes and rice one by one to the poor people present, who accepted them in order and bowed to thank them, which was very similar to the students receiving diplomas during the ceremony of graduating in a different industry. At that time, there was a poor Westerner with unkempt clothes standing on the side of the court. The group also gave him a set of cotton clothes, and he took off his hat to thank him before leaving. At that time, the members of the group distributed bread to the poor. While they were eating snacks, they listened to the songs of the male and female students. Amidst the ups and downs of the piano sound, they all showed their sincere gratitude. The situation of Catholics not distinguishing between classes, sitting together and enjoying themselves, was the first experience I had since participating in charitable gatherings.</p>
<p>Ms. Lu told reporters that the group will carry clothes to the poverty-stricken families in the Pudong area to visit them personally and give them to them at that time. She also said that the group's economy and manpower are insufficient, and she eagerly hopes that people from all walks of life will give them economic and spiritual sympathy and assistance so that their work can expand day by day and more poor people can be helped.</p>

<h3>New Stamps Have Arrived</h3>
<p>The increase in domestic postage rates and the issue in Shanghai District after Director Zha Peilin contacted separately has gradually gained insight and is expected to be formally decided within the next week or so. Once negotiated, it will be announced to everyone. However, the delay in this matter is due to various troubles. As for the new stamps needed at that time, a batch has now arrived.</p>
<h3>Faculty and Students of Tongwen College Attacked in Taicang, One Dead, Three Injured, Two Escaped</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, a long-distance bus from Wuxi to Shanghai was traveling from Taicang to Shanghai. At 3:50 p.m., when it arrived near Gelong Town in Taicang, several guerrillas from the area suddenly rushed to the side of the bus and ordered it to stop. At that time, the bus was carrying seven Chinese passengers and six faculty and students from Tongwen College in this port who were sent to investigate the Yutai area. At that time, all Chinese passengers were ordered to get off the bus, and then weapons were used to shoot at the bus. Four Japanese people in the bus were injured. Afterwards, the Japanese side received the news and urgently dispatched the nearby guard team to go there, but the guerrillas had already fled far away, not knowing where they went. Then the injured were sent by car to the nearby Japanese military hospital, but one of them had died due to injuries to the vital parts of the body. Afterwards, the bus on this road stopped operating that section starting on the 6th. Buses from Shanghai to Taicang only went as far as Jiading. According to an official announcement from the Japanese side yesterday, it was found that the injured in the attack were Bing Fenji (45 years old), a lecturer in the University Department of Tongwen College, who was injured in the chest, Jian Zhangsan (23 years old), a first-year student, who was seriously injured, and Kudo Shunichi (21 years old), who was injured in the left wrist. The other seriously injured person who died was named Miyagawa Seizo (21 years old), who was also a first-year student in the University Department. It is also said that Kiyono Yukio (25 years old) and Jue were hiding under the seats at the time, so they were able to escape.</p>

<h3>Inferior Son Coerces Father, Chops and Injures Maternal Uncle</h3>
<p>Ling Axing, an old man and former foreman of the French Tramway Company, is seventy years old this year. He lives at No. 508 Kangti Road in the French Concession. He has a son named Ling Zengyuan, who is thirty years old this year and also worked as an interpreter at the Tramway Company. He has been unemployed for over a year due to some reason, living off his father. Unexpectedly, Zengyuan has become addicted to opium and heroin, often coercing his father for money. If he doesn't get what he wants, he resorts to violence. On the night before last, at around 10 PM, Ling asked his father for money at home. When he didn't get it, he started beating him. Ling's maternal uncle, Yu A'gen (40 years old, local, also employed in the machinery department of the French Tramway Company), stepped forward to intervene. Unexpectedly, Ling Zengyuan became enraged out of shame and suddenly slashed his maternal uncle's head with a kitchen knife, immediately injuring him and causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Fortunately, relatives arrived and apprehended Ling, while the injured man was sent to the hospital for treatment. The case will be handled after he recovers.</p>
<h3>Claiming to be the "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps," Extorting Money Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>In recent days, several factories, shops, residences, and individuals in the two concessions have suddenly received letters bearing the name "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps," stating that due to the cold weather, they are raising money for winter clothing and hoping for enthusiastic support and donations from all sectors. However, according to inquiries made by the Daguan News Agency to the relevant authorities, it is claimed that this organization is purely fabricated and is clearly a scam by treacherous individuals to extort money. Last year, a similar incident occurred in this city involving the solicitation of donations for winter clothing and慰勞金 under the name of the "Anti-Japanese衛總司令部." Many citizens were deceived, but after the central government denied the organization, the scheme was eliminated. Now, the actions of this "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps" are exactly the same. It is hoped that all sectors will not be fooled and suffer unnecessary losses.</p>

<p>The Final Act Begins</p>
<p>Ruitang's Lin Dianhua passed to Ye Yiting, but Yiguang's Tao Ziming missed. Yiting kicked the ball into the empty goal, giving Ruitang a 1-0 lead in the first half.

<h3>Traditional Teacher Lectures on "A Scientific View of Life" (1)</h3>
<p>Yesterday's 16th Academic Lecture</p>
<p>Yesterday's academic lecture was the 16th session, held at the Buddhist Jingye Society. Professor Chuantong, a philosopher, lectured on "A Scientific View of Life." Chairman Zhu Xixuan gave an introductory speech, followed by Mr. Chuan's lecture, as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Chuan's Topic</p>
<p>The previous lectures were held at the Xuangong, which is a theater used for watching plays. Today's lecture is held here, which is not a stage, but we are here to study acting. Because our daily lives are like acting in a theater of heaven and earth. But what kind of play is it, how should we act, and what is the true nature of the play? These are the questions about the view of life that I want to talk about today. "A Scientific View of Life" is to use modern scientific knowledge (including physics, chemistry, physiology, psychology, and sociology) to have a view of life. I will limit myself to the following three points: What is life all about, is it bitter or happy, and how should we deal with it? First, let's talk about</p>
<p>The True Nature of Life</p>
<p>This point can be divided into two aspects:　"What is life?" Life is the life of human beings, or it can be said to be a life with personality. And life must have a material basis, its characteristics are that it can grow, be nourished, reborn, adapt, and be inherited, etc. The raw materials of life are composed of matter, and its chemical composition includes fat, protein, water, salt, and sugar. In short, it is composed of elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. It seeks stability in movement and movement in stability, making itself adaptable to environmental changes, seeking individual survival, and seeking the continuation of the race. This creates the characteristics of personality.　 (And the position of life in the universe) The position of people in the universe and the wonders of the world are like the stars in the sky and the sand on the beach, which cannot be counted. The earth is an extremely small grain of sand. One of the stars in the Orion Nebula has a volume 27 million times larger than the sun. And this kind of giant star, running through the sky, is like a small boat floating on the Pacific Ocean. Although it is separated from its neighboring stars by millions of miles, the smallness of the earth can be known, and the insignificance of people on the earth is even more unimaginable. But we cannot underestimate ourselves too much. How much greater are we than all the microbes and bacteria in nature?　 "From the scientific study of the true nature of life, we can see that everything in the universe is in motion, and there is a certain law of process and tendency. It differentiates from a homogeneous whole, from loosely organized to tightly organized, from concrete to abstract, to the point of exquisiteness. Human life activities in the changes of the universe can be regarded as the most differentiated, the most organized, and the most dexterous and abstract so far. This new organization must be more dexterous and refined than the original organization in order to evolve and develop.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement, Issue 409</p>
<h3>Where is Japan's Military Supply Line?</h3>
<p>— By Zhongdao Qian San, Translated by Yu Guan Yi</p>
<p>The Economic Background of Laiqi's Mission to the U.S. The Direction of the Japanese Army's Movements When There Are No Results. This fully reveals Japan's economic distress and indicates the role of sending Laiqi to the U.S. as an envoy. At the same time, it provides a concise outline of Japan's future direction. The U.S. President questioned Japan about the reasons for the increase in Japanese troops stationed in Annam. The real answer lies in this article. — Translator's Note</p>
<p>The rear supply line is a military term that refers to all military roads, railways, waterways, and other transportation lines used to maintain the field army and its base. The necessary equipment, tools, and the preparation and supply of all materials needed to maintain military supplies on the supply line are the tasks of the military supply station. It is impossible to fight on an empty stomach. If the activities of the military supply station cannot fully meet military needs, even a clever war plan will have no hope of victory. The rear supply line is related to the lives of soldiers and is an important condition for combat. This article will explain where Japan's military supply station is, based on the relationship between Japan and the United States, the Sino-Japanese War, and the relationship between Japan and the South Seas.</p>
<p>Japanese diplomacy is influenced by its economic dependence on Britain and the United States, especially the United States, so it is always mindful of the attitude of the United States. Since August 13th, Japan has not only been fighting against China but also against Britain and the United States behind China. However, Japan's military supply station, like China's, is in the United States and Britain. Japan relies on the United States and Britain for more than 50% of its important materials, 80% of which are obtained from the United States. This means that Japan's national defense, on which its safety depends, is in the hands of the enemy. No matter how hard it tries to expand production and move materials, it is still necessary to obtain imports of materials from the United States. Although the United States' aid to China makes the Japanese gnash their teeth, they still cannot help but smile at the White House, otherwise, it would be tantamount to destroying their own military supply station with their own hands. All previous Japanese-U.S. talks, especially the current mission of Laiqi to the U.S., have been aimed at preventing a revolt in the military supply station. If these Japanese-U.S. talks fail, Japan will have to change its rear supply line.</p>
<p>In fact, since the United States froze funds to Japan, this route in the Pacific Ocean has completely failed. A revolt has long since broken out in Japan's military supply station: the formation of the ABCD line, the beginning of the economic attack on Japan, and the increasing strengthening of aid to China. The military supply station has already attacked the Japanese army on the front line through the war in China. Therefore, if the Japanese-U.S. talks fail, the Japanese commander will have no choice but to destroy the military supply unit behind him and also to seek his own military supply station elsewhere. But where can Japan's military supply station be?</p>
<p>Germany's decisive attack on the Soviet Union was also based on the reason of recapturing its military supply station behind it. If the Soviet Union could faithfully perform its duties in the military supply station and maintain the supply of food and oil to Germany normally, this war would not have happened.</p>
<p>China, which has been attacked by the Japanese army for more than four years, is still able to continue fighting. Its possession of the Yunnan-Burma Road, which is its rear supply line, is also a major reason. On both sides of the key bridge on the Yunnan-Burma Road, there are huge amounts of labor and repair materials piled up. It has been bombed and destroyed by the Japanese army several times but is immediately repaired. This is also based on the principle of maintaining its rear supply line. Although the effect of air strikes in modern warfare is great, it is still useless if the Japanese flag cannot be erected in the enemy's camp. The necessity of destroying China's rear supply line is self-evident. So where should Japan start?</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Vietnam Road is also China's rear supply line, and it has become ineffective after the Japanese army occupied Annam. The Northwest supply line is also China's military supply station, but its effectiveness has decreased since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the future actions of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>However, the Yunnan-Burma Road is not only China's military supply station but also part of the British and American military supply station. The supply of more than a dozen important materials such as rubber, tin, and tungsten is also guaranteed by this road. The United States is threatening Japan from the position of the military supply station, and Japan must also confront it from the British and American military supply station. .</p>
<p>Japan's use of Britain and the United States as its own supply line has created a fatal wound in Japan's national defense. To overcome this fatal wound, it must establish a long-term plan. Comparing the distance between the United States and the South Seas, Japan takes 4,839 nautical miles to obtain oil from North America to Yokohama; if it is taken from the Dutch East Indies, it is only 2,600 nautical miles, which can shorten the journey by more than 30%. The shorter the distance, the shorter the transportation days, and the transportation capacity will increase relatively. If Japan imports oil from the South Seas, the one-time transportation period can be shortened by 10 to 17 days, and the annual transportation volume can be increased by about 1.9 million to 2.4 million tons. Now the Dutch East Indies has also frozen funds to Japan and is actively preparing for war against Japan. They have underestimated the strength of the Japanese army (?). They have joined the ABCD line and do not hesitate to fight against Japan. This is extremely reckless and presumptuous.

<p>Talking About the Past and the Present</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) on the Subject of Its Withdrawal</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jing Qing</p>
<p>The news of HSBC's withdrawal of its headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore is as disturbing as the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. This vanguard of the British Empire that manages Far Eastern finance — also an organ of the headquarters — has even temporarily abandoned its nearly century-old base. Coupled with the announcement by the American-owned Chase Bank that it is temporarily suspending the protection of deposit rights, the tension of the situation can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>HSBC and Jardine Matheson are the two major economic hubs of British operations in the Far East. HSBC, in particular, is responsible for maintaining the capital supply of all British commercial enterprises, undertaking the necessary exchange业务 for Far Eastern trade, and also using its hand to promote British Empire's capital exports to China, including economic and political loans. Since the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, its position in assisting China's war economy has become even more prominent. Before the United States joined this semi-standard association, it was virtually the representative of the Equalization Fund in Shanghai. Even now, it has not diminished its responsibility to support 法币.</p>
<p>HSBC was established in 1866. It was established based on the British King's Charter, the British Companies Act, and three colonial ordinances. The first basis indicates that it has a special mission, the second basis indicates that it is a British legal entity, and the third basis indicates that it is a colonial bank. At the beginning of its establishment, there were already twenty-two banks of British origin in the Far East, the oldest of which was the still existing麥加利. However, none of these twenty-two British-based banks possessed these three qualifications. Moreover, their headquarters were mostly in London, and most of them went bankrupt in the subsequent economic panics. HSBC survived these same storms and exists to this day. In addition to the ability of its authorities, it also benefited from the importance attached to its position by the imperial government. However, a bank of such importance arose from a casual conversation at an ordinary banquet.</p>
<p>It was in the summer of 1864 that a few British merchants living in Hong Kong, including the founder of Jardine Matheson — a sailor of a steamship sailing between India and Guangdong — decided to open this bank in a casual conversation at a banquet, using exclusively Far Eastern British commercial capital. Two months later, on August 6 of the same year, the inaugural meeting was held, and business began on April 1 of the following year. The initial authorized capital was only 5 million Mexican silver dollars, with half of it paid up. The headquarters were in Hong Kong, and branches were established in London and Shanghai. Soon after, a branch was established in Tokyo. After opening, the bank faced many 　　打击, especially in 1875, when the Hong Kong headquarters suffered a large bad debt from a搪厂, and the London branch lost more than £171,000 in investments in Spanish government bonds and British railway company bonds. This was truly misfortune upon misfortune, and its shares fell to 30% below par in an instant, making it extremely embarrassed. Then, a thorough reorganization began, and the situation gradually improved, and capital and business began to increase relatively. Before the outbreak of the First World War, the paid-up capital had increased to HK$15 million. After the end of the European War, it increased again to HK$20 million. Although the current capital is still more than HK$20 million, the reserve has exceeded HK$111 million. The branches and sub-branches are located in more than 40 ports around the world. The net profit in the past year reached more than HK$13.9 million. As a result, its shares have always attracted the attention of stock traders. The par value is only HK$125, but the market price since 1930 has often been around HK$1,200. This is the magic of the increase in reserve funds. Only in 1935, when it was affected by the silver bull, and last year, when it was affected by Britain's participation in the war, did it fall below HK$1,000 twice. However, the price drop last year was precisely during the period of speculative fervor in Shanghai foreign stocks, so it quickly rebounded and reached HK$1,500. Entering this year, although the market atmosphere has faded, it is still at HK$1,300 to HK$1,400. This withdrawal news should have stimulated the market, but there was no trading.</p>
<p>The British financial hub in the Far East not only has huge political loans to China, but also extends the control network of capital to important enterprises in various places. In Shanghai alone, in terms of real estate, there are恒業, 业广, and 华懋; in terms of trust, there are Chinese Railway, Sino-British, Fu Company, and Shanghai 銀 Company; in terms of insurance, there are the Far East; in terms of warehousing, there is the公和祥; in terms of trade, there are Allen &amp; Hanburys, Dafeng, Baosheng, Maolong, 惇信, Jardine Matheson Machines,麦边, Fuli, Biefa, and Taixing, etc.; in terms of industry, there are Jardine Matheson Textiles, Bode Woolen Yarn, Kodak Milk, Shanghai Water, etc.; the list is endless. From the fact that its current directors all hold positions as directors or managers of many commercial firms, it can be seen its influence among various enterprises, which truly deserves to be called the representative of modern financial capital.</p>
<h3>Wartime Commodity Common Sense: Steel and Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhi</p>
<p>Without steel, there is no modern civilization, and there are no modern weapons of war with such high destructive power. From bullets to shells, tanks, and warships, all must be made of steel. According to calculations by a Norwegian military commentator, the following amounts of weaponry are needed for a year of land and air offensive and defensive warfare on a front line of one thousand kilometers:</p>
<p>Based on this calculation, the monthly steel consumption per soldier is half a ton for the defending army and 11/20 of a ton for the attacking army, requiring six to six and a half tons per person per year. According to Soviet Marshal Molotov, the artillery firing power of a Red Army corps (i.e., three divisions) reaches sixty tons per minute. That means it reaches 3,600 tons per hour, and 10,000 tons of shells are used up in less than three hours of firing. The main raw material for shells is steel, and the raw material for all weapons is also steel. Without steel, there is no modern warfare; without steel, modern human life cannot be sustained. Not to mention anything else, just take the housewife in the family: without metal pots and pans, she cannot cook. Moreover, the manufacture of any production tool requires the use of steel. Historians say that humanity entered the Iron Age, and only then did it have today's scientific civilization. This is something that cannot be discounted in the slightest.</p>
<p>The raw materials for steelmaking are iron sand and scrap iron. Although the surface of scrap iron is oxidized, its quality remains unchanged. Moreover, one ton of scrap iron is more economical than two tons of iron sand rich in iron content. The importance of scrap iron can be imagined. Therefore, countries with scarce iron ore naturally have a strong need for scrap iron, especially during wartime.</p>
<p>The United States is the world's largest supplier of scrap iron, with an annual supply of more than 40 million tons, half for its own use and half for export. Japan is its largest customer. Now, the United States has banned the export of scrap iron to Japan, which has left Japan's military industry in a dire situation, no less than the United States' ban on oil exports to Japan.</p>
<p>In the past year, we have no longer seen trucks full of scrap iron on the roads. A year ago, it was a common sight. Where has this scrap iron gone? Needless to say, it has been shipped to Japan. The scrap iron recovery movement is now being carried out enthusiastically in various countries, and Japan is doing it even more thoroughly. A church removed its iron plates and steel bars from its roof, obtaining scrap iron worth 120,000 to 130,000 Japanese yen, but spent more than 400,000 Japanese yen in repair costs to replace them with bricks and tiles. This is the material for today's Tokyo street talk, used to emphasize the propaganda of collecting civilian scrap iron. Then, once the Japanese-American war begins, will the cement-steel-framed mansions and demolition workers in Shanghai also encounter different fortunes?</p>

<h3>Hoarding Again</h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>The crows of the world are always the same black.</p>
<p>Look, people are bleeding, using their bodies as the Great Wall of the country; many ordinary people are ruined and their property reduced to ashes because of the war; yet there are still a group of unconscionable people, taking advantage of the fire to rob, fishing in troubled waters, desperately trying to get rich. Such are the unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai who hoard goods, and the hoarding cases cracked in Chengdu number nearly twenty. Where is conscience? How lamentable!</p>
<p>The items hoarded in Chengdu, although not as diverse as those in Shanghai, are all essential daily necessities that "take lives." Rice, vegetable oil, cloth, firewood. These are all things that everyone needs and is willing to spend a lot of money to buy. The psychology of the hoarders, originally not caring about the life and death of others, need not be elaborated on.</p>
<p>Among this group of hoarders, there are those (including so-called bankers and wealthy merchants), which is enough to make people's hair stand on end; and among them, there are even civil servants—staff members of the Price Adjustment Committee of the Provincial Government—which is even more heartbreaking. Knowing the law and breaking the law, the crime is doubled, and these few madmen will certainly be subject to the most severe sanctions.</p>
<p>The special meeting of the Military Commission decided to severely punish those who hoard for profit; all those arrested will be handed over to military courts for trial. How to deal with them in the future, the country has its own laws, and we will wait and see.</p>
<p>Looking around, there are still many unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai whose hearts are covered by lard, disregarding the painstaking efforts of the Municipal Council's fair price measures and the serious burden on the citizens, and are still trying their best to exploit profits. Although there is no economic inspection team organization here, everyone, for the sake of their own interests, is guarding against being attentive at any time to remedy the Municipal Council's shortcomings!</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Vehicle Price Increase</h3>
<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>The British merchant's sale of cars and buses company's request to increase fares was ignored by the British Concession authorities and was not implemented (only an additional law has been proposed). Unexpectedly, the French Concession Water and Electricity Company suddenly implemented a price increase on December 1st. This sudden price increase by the French Concession tram and bus company has left the general public at a loss. If it is said that rice prices are expensive, the authorities have now suppressed them to 130 yuan per picul. If it is said that fuel is scarce and prices are firm, the two authorities are now also trying to dredge the source of coal and suppress its price. Speaking of the increase in the living standards of workers, the living standards of the masses are not necessarily high. Is the Water and Electricity Company particularly different? Moreover, the company's profits are not necessarily low.</p>
<p>The French merchant's Water and Electricity Company has increased the price of electric lights for users to four corners per character since August, and then increased by 40% in September, to five corners and six cents per character. In October, the price was increased again to six corners per character. By November, the Water and Electricity Company announced that it would automatically reduce electricity fees, reducing each character by four cents, still at the September rate of five corners and six cents. At that time, tap water was also pushed back in the same way. Although the numbers were small, the citizens all praised the company authorities' wisdom in reading the beauty, sympathizing with the difficulties of the citizens, and reducing the heavy burden. How long has it been, and now the company brazenly disregards public opinion, claiming that expenses have not been reduced, and restored the October electricity fee, still at six corners per character. However, its water fee has secretly increased, increasing again and again, decreasing and then increasing, resembling the rise and fall of market goods. Is this the behavior that public utility agencies should have?</p>
<p>Every price increase by the Water and Electricity Company affects all other goods, and the trend of rising prices is terrible. In simple terms, it affects the issue of housing. For example, landlords demand that tenants increase rent due to the increase in water and electricity fees. If their wishes are not fulfilled, they are subjected to the pressure of cutting off water and electricity. If they are not careful and a fire breaks out, water can extinguish it, preventing it from spreading. If the water is cut off, they grope in the dark and cannot escape, burying themselves in the fire pit. This has been seen in news reports. The author hopes that the two Concession authorities, at this time, will consider the difficulties of the people and take good measures regarding the sudden price increase of the Water and Electricity Company, in order to meet the expectations of the public.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen. "Papa, let's go busking!"</p>
<p>"It's their house!" She moved her body slightly and said intently, "They also fled from the north, a family of four. Besides the old lady and a middle-aged couple, there is also a daughter, maybe a year older than me. They probably arrived in Shanghai earlier than us. When they first arrived, they also had great difficulties in life because they were unfamiliar with the place. But last month, just when you were seriously injured, I often went in and out of the gate and saw that they were all dressed much more neatly, and their faces also had a lively color. Later, I heard the sound of opera singing in their room. A few days ago, the landlady here was chatting with me, and I occasionally asked about the family downstairs, and she told me everything..."</p>
<p>Begonia listened very intently, but at the same time coughed intermittently.</p>
<p>"It turns out that their surname is Han. The girl's father has always liked to listen to opera. When he was in Shandong, he often played tickets and slowly taught the girl. After fleeing to Shanghai this time, they had nowhere to go like us. Later, they met a fellow villager who taught him to play the huqin and take his daughter to the tavern every day to busk. The fee for singing a section is one yuan, but some people give two yuan. In addition to the waiters in the restaurant having to share a few pennies, they can earn seven or eight yuan on good days. I secretly listened to her singing last night, and it's really not better than me. So if we also take this path, maybe we can earn more than them! (282)</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Letting a Maid Lead the Child?</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>In Chinese families, most of them entrust the responsibility of leading children to maids. These maids from the countryside have not received education. How can they shoulder this major responsibility? All they can teach children to do is to hit and scold people, especially the latter. When children learn to speak, they take the opportunity to deeply imprint this bad behavior in the minds of children.</p>
<p>The British writer H.G. Wells, who wrote "The Outline of History" and "The Shape of Things to Come," once said, "Our childhood grows up in the hands of those nannies, so it is inevitable that we will be affected by them and acquire their habits." This sentence is correct. In families in the United Kingdom and the United States, many housewives also hand over the responsibility of leading children to nannies. However, nannies in the United Kingdom and the United States still have considerable knowledge and can also teach children to do some needlework or read a few pages of books for children. Maids in China definitely do not have this kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>Of course, the greatest responsibility still lies with the parents. If they let the maids take care of the children and do not ask or listen, only planning for their own enjoyment, then they have not fulfilled their responsibility as parents.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. In families with too many children, a housewife is too busy and has to find a few helpers. In this situation, parents still cannot forget to pay attention to the upbringing of their children. If they hand it over to maids, then they must work hard to supervise them, because the creation of outstanding talents is definitely not easy.</p>
<h3>Are You a Good Parent?</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Here are a few questions you can test. If the answer to a question is "No," you can get four points. If it is "Sometimes," you get three points. "Rarely" you get two points. "Yes" you get one point.</p>
<p>Do you often forget that your child is no longer three years old?</p>
<p>Do you talk about your child's shortcomings in front of guests? Do you often say to your child that they are lucky that you brought them into this world?</p>
<p>Do you prohibit your child from reading a certain book for no reason?</p>
<p>Do you quarrel with your husband or wife in front of your child?</p>
<p>Do you show disgust when your child's friends call?</p>
<p>Do you preach to your child?</p>
<p>Do you want to check your child's companions?</p>
<p>Do you talk to your child with a stern face?</p>
<p>When your child wants to study home economics or agriculture, do you insist that they study medicine?</p>
<p>The more points you get, the better. If the score is too low, you should change your attitude.</p>
<h3>Worth a Try: Making Briquettes from Shredded Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>Coal briquettes are very expensive right now, so we can soak the shredded newspaper that has been used to wrap things in water overnight, mix it with half the amount of coal briquette powder, and knead it together like broken cotton wool. Then, knead it into round lumps, about the size of a fist, and dry it in the sun. It can be used instead of coal briquettes. The firepower is very strong, it burns for a long time, and it is better than coal briquettes, because coal briquettes are mixed with mud, and self-made coal briquettes are replaced with shredded newspaper, so the effect is better. It is worth a try.</p>
<h3>Removing Worries</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>Many family quarrels arise from unnecessary worries. In fact, when you are a little worried, please do not sit still, but tell your friends about your worries. At the same time, do not complain about yourself or get angry. The best way is to stand up, go for a walk outside, or find your friends. The following four steps can help you remove your worries in time.</p>
<p>Step 1: Collect all the facts about the things that are bothering you.</p>
<p>Step 2: Divide the facts into good and bad.</p>
<p>Step 3: Think of a plan.</p>
<p>Step 4: Start implementing the plan.</p>
<p>My Family Problems</p>
<h3>Unveiling of the Tenth徵文 Contest: A Wife Who Doesn't Sleep Late at Night</h3>
<p>— Bao Ying</p>
<p>My family is very simple, one husband, one wife, and one child. My husband's income is enough to maintain our life. He has no bad habits or improper behavior. To be fair, he is an ideal husband. As for me? I dare to believe that I am absolutely no worse than others. Managing the home, taking care of the child, helping my husband with professional chores, what more can a man ask of his wife?</p>
<p>But we have a separation in our feelings. He doesn't say it, and I don't want to explain it to him. The reason is that I like to get up late at night. My habit of getting up late at night doesn't hinder him in any way. We sleep in separate beds. I get up quietly by myself, covering the lights so that they are not too bright. Then I open my favorite books to read quietly, or write a few articles as the mood strikes me. I dare to guarantee that I will never disturb him. The best proof is that my three-year-old child has never been awakened. So can you say that it is something that should not be done?</p>
<p>If he were a reasonable person, he should sympathize with me, because the reason why I have to get up at night is because I have no time during the day. Household chores and the noise of children make it impossible for me to have a moment to concentrate on writing and reading, so I have to save sleep time to satisfy my desires. Isn't that something worth sympathizing with? Especially as a husband, he should think about my happiness even more. Who knows him, alas, not only does he not have the slightest sympathy or pity, but he also regards this matter as my fault. He is not an old stubborn. He is an excellent young man from a brand-new university. Does he also think that women should only sew clothes and embroider pillow flowers and cannot read books and write articles? I know he thinks this way, so whenever I make a slight mistake in doing things during the day, he says in a sarcastic tone: "You are too hardworking at night, so you are not energetic during the day." He blames people's occasional mistakes on reading at night, as if there would never be the slightest mistake if they didn't read at night. Hmph! Sometimes he even says, "I know you are a writing genius, and it's a grievance to have you manage the housework!" That's even more nonsensical. Things like this are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>These kinds of small disagreements may not be considered family problems at the moment, but, as time goes on, they will inevitably cause the feelings between the two sides to gradually break down. I cannot stop writing and reading, nor can I take any time other than at night to do this kind of work. If he cannot change his original intention, then the consequences are really unimaginable.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Writing is actually the best pastime for women, and reading is a good way for housewives to increase their knowledge. I cannot blame you for not sleeping late at night, because writing requires emotions. Therefore, the American Woman's Digest magazine once had an article advising women not to marry a husband who is engaged in writing.</p>
<p>Now, Mrs. Bao Ying's situation is exactly the opposite. Because she doesn't sleep late at night, it has aroused her husband's dissatisfaction. This may be due to two reasons. One is that perhaps because she is focused on writing and reading, she has neglected the spiritual adjustment between the couple. The second is perhaps due to the husband's competitive mentality. He does not want his wife to be more capable than him. Competitiveness is a common characteristic of people, and because of competitiveness, they forget the rights of others.</p>
<p>I think the best way is to take a moderate approach. If you want to get up at night, you may as well reduce the number of times, because the durability and happiness of marriage completely require both parties to understand each other and correct themselves. If they each go to extremes, it will definitely lead to bad results.</p>
<p>But never give up the spirit of progress, because Chinese culture needs to be promoted diligently.</p>
<p>Unveiling of the next competition: A father who is beaten and scolded by his son.</p>
<h3>A Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Mrs. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Cauliflower is not something amazing at all, but in this time of soaring prices, it has become aristocratic. Yesterday someone sent me two cauliflowers, so I had a good meal, but it cost me more than two yuan. One and a half yuan for pork, one yuan and two corners for Guangdong squid. Fortunately, I have ready-made ham and mushrooms at home, so I used them as supplements. The pork was sliced, the squid was cut into strips, and they were stir-fried with ham cubes, mushroom slices, cauliflower, etc. A little water chestnut flour was added, and the taste was not bad. If shrimp meat, chicken slices, and duck slices are used instead of pork slices and squid, the taste will naturally be even more endless.</p>

<h3>(150) Crab-Stuffed Meat</h3>
<p>— Draft by Wu Beiying</p>
<p>Preparation: Fresh Meat, Crab, Shrimp Roe Soy Sauce or Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence</p>
<p>Water Chestnut Flour, Cooking Wine, Sugar, Salt, Scallions, Ginger, MSG</p>
<p>Method: Chop the fresh meat, mix with soy sauce essence or shrimp roe soy sauce, and an appropriate amount of sugar, cooking wine, water chestnut flour, MSG, salt, etc., and mix with chopsticks. Then, wash the crab, use a small knife to pry open the crab's abdomen, stuff the mixed meat into the crab's abdomen, then put it into a bowl, add scallion knots and ginger slices, steam it until cooked, and it is ready.</p>
<h3>(151) Stir-fried Cabbage with Crab Roe</h3>
<p>— Draft by Yao Kechang</p>
<p>Preparation: Four or Five Crabs, Cooking Wine, Tianjin Cabbage, Scallions, Ginger, Lard, Raw Oil, Salt, MSG</p>
<p>Method: First boil the crabs, remove the yellow meat, and mix with ginger shreds, scallion pieces, cooking wine, etc., and stir-fry with lard. Set aside. Separately wash and chop the cabbage, mix with an appropriate amount of MSG and salt, then heat oil and stir-fry. When it is cooked, spread the stir-fried crab roe on the cabbage, cover and braise for a while, and serve when it is cooked through.</p>
<p>It is not easy to transform one food item into many ways to eat it. Moreover, crabs are always boiled first and then the crab roe is removed, making it more difficult to change than raw chicken, duck, fish, and meat. However, the ways to eat and taste the crabs are distinguished by the various dishes they are paired with and the skill of the operation.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen... If you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special delivery will be made immediately, without taking any delivery fees.</p>
