<p>按赫斯身材魁梧、目光炯然、爲納粹首腦之一、雖在納粹內閣中、從未如空軍上將戈林或宣傳部長戈培爾之顯露頭角、然聞頗具有左右希特勒之勢力、現年四十五、在黨中位居第三、僅在希特勒與戈林之次、當一九三九年九月一日德軍進犯波蘭時、希特勒在議會中曾稱、一設余逝世、則繼余職者為戈林、而戈林之後復有赫斯、此皆爾等所應奉為領袖如對余者也」云、有時除希特勒外、納粹要人之照片常刊報端映於影片者、莫赫斯若、上月曾有赫斯已飛往西班牙携畫送致弗朗哥將軍之消息、但德官塲旋吾認之、十二日前赫斯曾在慕尼黑接見西班牙法西斯集團領釉兼西班牙海軍部長馬利諾、一九二三年希特勒起事失敗後、與赫同繫獄中、迨希特勒得勢、赫斯仟聯絡部主任、而供給希氏所需之情報、赫斯幼年居埃及、稍長在亞力山大利亞英人學校肄業、一九一四年戰事發作、遂不能升入英人大學、平素除挺進隊褐衫與黑衛隊之黑杉外、從不御其他服裝、其人舉止尙屬溫和、寡於言而敏於事、生活至樸素如希特勒然、（十三日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c7">美蘇態度對照觀 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>美國的「不參戰」，蘇聯的「和平政策」，使他們經過這幾年而依然站在戰爭漩渦之外。但他們分別所出的代價，皆已甚鉅，即如美國去年坐視法國淪亡，蘇聯隱忍於德義的席捲巴爾幹。到現在，仍被牽到戰爭的邊沿。至於終能避免捲進漩渦與吾，是絕大問題，疑雲籠罩了全世界人士的心頭。</p>
<p>美國最近幾個月來的種種舉措，雖在主觀上並不廢棄「不參戰」的原則，然客觀事實並不如此，蓋問題祇在會不會由物資的參戰進到正面的軍事行動。至於蘇聯，雖沒有放棄所標榜的「和牛政策」，雖努力於國內建設，然而同時推進其全國的動員與戒備。牠當前的問題，是會不會再與德義進一步在近東妥協？或會不會抵制德義伸入近東與土耳其？這兩種可能，不問取那一種，而其實際皆是捲人戰爭。</p>
<p>關於美國的參戰問題，如僅以德義情形爲根據，美國現在似乎並沒有直接動手的必要；而德義的陸空軍，在事實上遠隔重洋，亦無法對美開戰。如以日本情形爲根據，美國除被攻襲，或日本攻英，美國也沒有出以正面的軍事行動的必要。審察這幾個月來，德義日三國所作種種舉措。表面上未見何種準備立即對美作戰的跡象。縱使美國以更大規模援助英國而且從事護運、亦當難想像德義立即有何嚴重反應。要知目前的問題焦點，還在蘇聯，而美國祇圖應付，實居被動地位。何以言之：倘若蘇德確有再一次的妥協，在醞釀之中，而企圖瓜分近東，則英帝國的陸上防禦，即使祗爲對付德國，亦需美國以人力爲援助，何况還有蘇聯參加侵略集團呢！美國到那時候，爲了世界大局，爲了自身將來的安危，當然不得不採取重大行動而出於一戰。故爲美國打算，縱使自身與蘇聯難於携手，至少亦得以相當代價，去阻止蘇聯與德義相合作。所謂代價，其惟一戰！從另一方面說，現在所傳蘇德對近東的妥協，其間扞格亦多，以常情常理來推測，殊難遽信蘇聯竟會採取這樣的自縛舉動，使自己陷入一個空前的危機。萬一德義勢力伸進近東之後，蘇聯勢必喪失一個盟友土耳其，至於爾後怎樣與德義日三國相處美滿，則隨時隨地皆成問題。不若是而採取堅强立塲，抵制德義的插足近東，則在今天這種國際形勢中，亦惟有與英美土等國站於一條戰綫。</p>
<p>離開純利害的觀點，使人不能不想到的，是立塲與原則的問題。侵略國的德義日之間，顯然存在着許多難以調和的矛盾；可是他們彼此呼應的侵略行動，却至少建立在一點一致之上，這就是反對英美法及蘇聯。幾年以前，蘇聯曾提出反對侵略的口號，希望使所有其餘國家團結起來，以反抗暴力的前進，這一運動當時的不幸失敗，當然要歸過於英法等國當政者的短視與偏見。一直到現在這種千鈞一髮的時候，面對着侵略勢力的凶鋒，世界僅存的幾個主要反侵略國家間，還是無法取得一致，這是非常痛心的事。這些國家之間，因爲立國制度的不同，存在着種種矛盾，但這些矛盾與當前共同的危機相對比，以及因之而引起對全人類未來前途的危機相對比，則所謂矛盾也者，實在算不了什麼。而英美與蘇聯間一日不能合作，全世界正義力量就一天無法團結，侵略勢力的凶燄也就一天無法壓服，而使牠有各個擊破的機會。這是洞若觀火的事，大概英美蘇等國大部份人士都能明白體認的吧。如果正義力量終可結合，人類文明終是趨向光昌，則現在應該已經到了各國當政力抑偏見，尋覓合作的最緊急的時候了！</p>

<h3 id="c30">美國女作家　鮑茜女士談創作經驗 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 宇楨</p>
<p>邇來美國作家來華考察者，接踵而至，著名劇作家克蘭爾鮑茜女士Clare　Boothe最近亦偕其夫亨利魯斯（美國「時代」及「幸福」等雜誌主筆）遊歷重慶。這篇是紐的泰晤士報所載女士的談片，茲譯錄如下</p>
<p>「我不歡喜一般人，生平知已屈指可數。」鮑茜女士開頭就這麼說。</p>
<p>這是下午五點鐘光景，她向僕役要了一壺沸水，一只檸檬和一柄小刀。她切開檸檬，把汁擠在開水裹，然後飲着。鮑茜女士接着講起她怎樣在無意之中寫成「女人」這部哄動一時的劇本。</p>
<p>「某天晚上，」她說，「我和亨利到一個夜總會去，我獨自走進婦女室裏，他在門外整整等了一個半鐘頭。等到我出來的時候，他問我在裏面幹些什麼。我說和姑娘們談天。他叉追究談些甚麼。我不料他會破天荒地注意到女人們的事情來了。他本是個極富好奇性的男人，什麼事情，不逗起他的興趣則罷，要是打動了他的好奇心，便不肯放鬆。因此我想把剛才所談的悄形，的略吿訴他。那知不想則已，一想自己不覺吃了一驚，原來我們所談的一切，無非搬弄舌根。</p>
<p>「週末我們夫婦到白蘇爾孚旅行，剛到目的地，他給公司裏召回去了。此時我仍念念不忘於女總會裏的人們和她們的隱私，想到獨自留此，實在無聊，不期而然地伸紙握筆，在玩紙牌的檯子上把這些枝枝節節，湊合攏來，使她們各自現身說法。我接連寫了三天，順着單純的故事寫下去，三天之後「女人」的劇本就產生了」</p>
<p>鮑茜慣於用鋼筆墨水寫稿，下筆如飛。她有一面寫稿面複贖的癖性。耍是用打字機代替筆桿，就會永遠複讀最後的幾行字，停息在這上面了。她對於自己的原稿，倒也不加珍惜，當戲院老闆要求她修改底本中的幾個小節時，她不惜把全劇重寫，但必須她親自動手，不許別人越俎代庖。她用這種方法保全著作權。她說她寗願著書，因爲書本發揮一已的思想，決不會有人冒昧進言</p>
<p>她是一個熬夜的作家，但自二度結婚以來，已經改變初衷。因爲她的丈夫整日忙不開交，只有晚上有功夫休息，她倘若晚上辦公，夫婦倆只好白頭不相見了。她爲潛心寫作起見，往往固閉一室，謝絕一切酬酢。在紐的的時候，常把電話掛斷，在格林威鎭的時候，常假托已出門打高爾夫球，游泳，盪舟或作其他的娛樂去了</p>
<p>大凡寫劇本的人，對於情節一項，往往極費推敲，她却並不重視。她說「在「將錯就錯』一個劇本中，我把男主角送命兩次，以爲佈局新奇之至。曾不幾時，我現發這不過是偵探小說家的老調。所以我現在信筆拈來，不再矯柔造作。我最近着手的一部作品，單就基木情節而論，可說和忒里斯頓和蕙莎　的故事（中古愛情悲劇）差不多。」</p>
<p>鮑茜女士自稱她在童年時代就知道將來不成為女演員，就成爲劇作冢。有一偭時期，曾登臺演戲，可是演得糟透，自知無望。後來出嫁了，數年內就和一羣與書本寫作無緣的人混在一起，幾乎被他們同化。但她離婚之後。唯一的念頭，就是給那一個雜誌寫稿子，一心找個出風頭的工作。</p>
<p>她寫了三個劇本，都歸流產。隨後寫成「聽天由命」一劇，叙述一個嫁給酒徒的靑年婦人，被百老匯舞台物色着。一九三六年寫成的「女人，」初時並不爲批評家們激賞，但終於哄動一時，奠定了她的地位。兩年之後，又出版「吻別羣兒」，同樣受到嚴厲的批評，而結果獲得相當成功。最後寫成的「將錯就錯」，則略爲遜色。</p>
<p>飽茜女士近作「歐洲之春」，紀實和理論並重，是她這次歐戰爆發前夕游歷歐洲後的結晶。她在一九三九年二月，以新聞記者的資格，前往歐洲，遍歷法荷比英諸國，這時歐洲風雲激變的時候，她芳踪所到，獲得不少見聞。六月間回到紐的，就把見聞所及，寫成一萬字的長篇論文，寄到她的夫君魯斯主編的生活雜誌。後來她覺得有比論文中更多的話要說，於是使退居鄉間，發憤苦作，六個禮拜後，就全部脫稿定名「歐洲之春」。</p>
<p>這書出版後，號召力的大和銷路的暢，都爲她以前劇本所未有。她純以美國人的見解，分析歐洲的病態，並且利用寫作劇本的技巧，來發揮警闢的理論，引人入勝。這又是她的一個創作新經騐。</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>自從硫製橡皮（Ie　vulcanisation）和硬性橡皮發明以後，橡膠的需要大見殷切，各國人士紛粉在世界各處尋找那能擠出乳汁的「植物牛」，一時形成橡膠熱」的時期，可是由各處採集來的橡膠有的質地欠佳，有的竭澤而漁，來源易斷，將來這種供給問題，着實需要仔細硏究呢，於是處處從商業着想的央國，當然不能不顧慮到此，籌畫對策了，公元一八七六年，英政府派遣有名的植物學家Wickham和Narkham往巴西調查，他們採集了Hevea橡樹的種子，歸國後，種在倫敦太晤士河右岸那極著名的Kew植物園中，小橡樹秧長出來了，他們用一種能携帶的養花房（Serres　portatives），極珍異的把不到二百株樹秧護送到錫蘭島上，十年以後，藉着植物園的助力，新嘉坡也能把橡樹秧供給馬來半島上的植樹家了，二十五年以後，又經過多少技術上的探索，金錢上的犧牲，在馬來半島和錫蘭島上已竟有四十萬公畝的橡林存在了，如今呢，已竟擴充到一百三十萬公畝，許多新的工具，新技術，—是由印第安人的故技改進而來，—相繼出現，橡樹的特性，供給能力，當然也有仔細的研究，不像從前那種「殺鷄求蛋」的辦法，現在呢，橡樹按步就班的出產橡膠，眞如同乳牛供給乳汁一樣。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年時巴西供給的橡膠是二萬六千噸，共他世界各處採集的橡膠，差不多也是二萬六千噸，錫蘭島和馬來半島的人工培植橡樹，只出產了四噸，到一九二〇年，巴西的出產還是照舊，其他世界各處减少了五分之四，英國人培植的橡林，（連南洋羣島的）則出產了五十萬噸，而且祇是從那一種Hevea橡樹供給的！參考書法國大百利全書，Coutiere生物世界，世界名人辭典。（完）</p>

<p>新任司令同輪偕來</p>
<p>與高斯同輪來滬者、另有美海軍新任駐滬第四海軍聯隊司令霍華德上校、霍司令原任美桑狄哥海軍陸戰隊弟六營長、按霍氏任職海軍睦載隊、已歷有二十七年之史跡、一九一四年五月十一日奉命離華盛頓赴海軍陸戰隊供職、一九三八年晋上校銜、先後歷仟海地·聖多明谷·華盛頓·各地陸戰隊司令、滬美當局深慶得人、霍氏抵　後、稍作休息、卽行定期就聯、</p>
<p>美僑團體卽晚公宴</p>
<p>高斯大使在任澳洲公使前、原任駐滬總領事職、在滬交游廣闊、爲人精明能幹、夙爲美上峯所器重、一九四〇年一月、高斯啣國務院命、赴馬尼拉會同赫德上將·沙意駐菲專員·舉行三鉅頭會議、會商菲島防務、檢討遠東一般問題、美各報對高斯備加揄揚、同年一月十九日、羅斯福總統仟命高斯爲首任駐澳公使、自離滬迄今、適爲一載此間美僑方面以及各公團與高氏友好、以高氏榮任大使、重臨斯地、不勝忭慰、爲表示歡迎以叙離衷起見、由美僑協會領導下、定今晚七時、假大西路哥倫比亞總會公宴高氏、屆時美總領及各國駐滬使節、均將出席參加、</p>

<p>公共租界工部局所辦理之首批平價港米五萬三千一百九十六包、已於本月十一·十二兩日、由漢陽輪·明生輪·江蘇輪·太原輪先後裝載抵埠、適値該兩日天雨綿綿、未克起卸、因之分配手續、亦未及辦理竣事、據立基洋行負責人吿平明社記者稱、是項平價米、大的二三日內可由各米號開始發售、現已印就通知單、催吿各訂購糧雜行與米號、限其三日內將貨款付淸出貨、即可以之應市矣、因之此數日來、米號門前、除迫不及待之升斗小民外、幾無人問津、米價昨又跌落三四元、</p>
<p>二批港米接踵運滬</p>
<p>據航業界消息、第二批港米、今明兩日內即可抵滬、承載者爲怡和公司之裕生輪、及太古公司之廣東輪、至發售日期、據立基洋行經理克尼雪爾特表示、在週末前、當係一二日內、並聞立基洋行已向港方續訂二十五萬包、備下月份運滬發售、</p>
<p>今日開始前往提貨</p>
<p>承銷工部局港米之立基洋行及祥茂洋行、連日工作、忙碌異常、按立基洋行係吿負辦理訂貨及提貨手續、祥茂洋行則爲訂米者付款處、現立基洋行已將首批運滬之港米、辦妥報關上棧等手續、聞米行米號將於今日起、向該二洋行開始提貨、以備發售、又悉、兩租界當局、爲促成租界區域內各米號從速購辦是項港米應市起見、其資金較薄之米號、則可集合數家、向立基洋行合訂、</p>
<p>貨款交割依據條件</p>
<p>（一）付款、三天內如數付淸、以現款交換棧房提單、（二）出貨期、自出賣日起十天內出貨、吾則棧租費由承賣人負擔、（三）重量、倘於出賣日起十天內不將貨物出去、則此項貨物、將不再過磅、即以輪船提單之重量作爲出貨時之重量、而由承買人收受之、（四）保險、自出賣日起、所有貨物貯藏之各項危險、均由承買人負擔、至火險自即日起祇有十天、（五）其他條件、承買人承諾切實依照其簽署之公共租界工部局條件、將來零售、承諾彼所出售之米、每一包或超過一包時、應附發票、載明購售者之姓名住址、並應添具副本、於捕房人員隨時到店調查時、提示備查、又零售商對於每一食戶、每月不得供給超過其一家應需之米量、除專供上海食戶外、一概不得發售、</p>
<p>謹防米蠧魚目混珠</p>
<p>各雜糧行及米號收到立基洋行之付款通知單後、可於三日內往廣東路二十號祥茂洋行繳清貨款、在十日內可持提單前往單上註明之棧房出貨、至於過磅手續、工部局已託北京路二號泡立生台維洋行及外灘十二號三義洋行兩家担任、又昨日兩租界盛傳工部局平價港米業已由各米號發售、並非事實、惟據記者調查所得、法租界內發現少數米號、於其售米中、揷立一脾、上書「平價米」三字、定價爲一百十元、且米多雜碎、與仰光四十粒小絞米成色大相懸殊、異而詢之、據答、此爲香港連滬之平價米、與工部局承辦之港米完全無二、並勸記者購買、如此魚目混珠、巳成詐欺罪行、不僅破壞牛價米之信譽、且有損市民利益、希望租界當局激底查究、以儆奸宄、</p>
<p>越南廉米到滬有期</p>
<p>又據法租界公董局負責者稱、該當局亦爲穩定民食、抑平米價起見、曾於日前向越南當局直接訂購貢米二十萬包、現首批五萬包、已裝華綸洋行經理之（一）Varenne輪三萬包、該輪現甫兼灣仰光於來滬途中、本月十六日可抵埠、（二）Sarraut輪二萬包、該輪可於本月二十日抵埠、至於其餘十五萬包、最遲於本月底可完全抵此、屆時法租界各合法米號、均可享受代售廉米權利、至於其售價因該當局所辦米糧係西貢米、品質允佳、屆時將視國際滙兌率臨時決定、惟各種手續、則與公共租界雷同、</p>
<p>香港方面存米過湧</p>
<p>又據香港來人談、目下香港政府為應需要起見、早經向越南暹邏緬甸等洋米產區、訂購大宗洋米、故連日港方運到洋米甚湧、各堆棧已堆積滿谷、故此次載運港米抵滬之各輪、一俟卸貨完畢、即須駛港承載米糧來滬、港政府於實施統制米糧前、一部勢力較大之米商、曾請港政府准予官商合辦、但為港政府所拒絕、因港政府鑒於歷次所訂限價、均係被奸商作超越限價而破壞、故有此決心、</p>

<p>美商友邦人壽保險公司舉行二十屆股東年會、該公司總理費孟福提出去年該公司營業狀况報吿、茲將該項報吿譯述如左、</p>
<p>營業進展</p>
<p>在第二十屆友邦人壽保險公司股東年會席中、董事會授權本人報吿去年本公司營業狀况、去年本公司營業、共獲盈利七五·九六三·六二美元除出三九·七九一·〇九美元爲保戶紅利外、凈盈三六·一七二·五〇三美元、但投資及滙兌等項之盈利尙不在內、此項凈盈之數已加上一五四·四八四·一五美元、（此係前年底止盈餘之數）、此外、更有投資盈利二二·〇六七美元、保單註銷而未經領去之保戶紅利一·六七四·三〇美元、以及滙兌與重估投資價値之盈利四八·五四〇·九五美元共計一〇八·四五四·七六美元股東紅利去年共付出兩萬李元、經理員欠款亦增加至六·三六〇·四四美元、此均係應自盈餘中减去之項目、同時董事會認爲應再自盈餘中减去三萬元、俾將投資及滙兌準備金增至六萬美元總計、自盈餘减去之總額達五六·三六〇·四四美元、結果純盈爲二〇六·五七八·四九美元、較前依據美國制度、本公司所已設置壽金準備金、目前達二·五一三·〇二一·八一美元、公司之資產總額達三·二四〇·〇七七·一二美金、較前年十二月三十一日止、增加四三四·一六三·一六三·二九美元、</p>
<p>準備充足</p>
<p>本公司投資分配、極為良家、現金準備甚鉅、此非用以履行任何負僓義務、但在目前世界時局中、加强流動資金、實極需要、吾人現金準備雖屬極鉅、然自利息紅利及租金之收入、仍達九八·五五八·一八美元、或即公司資產最低限度百分之三·五六之利益、是足以維持保單準備之利息需要、</p>
<p>死亡率低</p>
<p>一九四〇年、太公司保戶死亡率極低、祗及預計百分之四二·五、按一九三九年死亡率達預計百分之五三·〇三、其時吾人已認爲滿意、此種特殊紀錄、一部份係由於在過去數年中新保戶之激增、同時足徵遠東戰事對於本公司保戶之死亡率尙未有鉅大之影響、</p>
<p>保額增加</p>
<p>夫人壽保險公司之重要成就、應以有效之保險額增加作標準、　據此點、本公司去年之成績、極爲可觀、新保險額較前年增加百分之五十、結果除去一切失效保單及已經賠償等外、本公司有效保險額增加達三·六二七·二九〇美元之數、</p>
<p>菲島業務</p>
<p>截至去年十二月三十一日止、本公司有效保險總額達一九·九三二·〇三一美元、其中百分之五十、乃爲菲島人民投保者、百分之十六爲香港人民投保者、其餘則爲散布公司營業各地之數、就中國而言、有效保險總額以美元計算、已告銳减、祗爲總數中不到百分之十二、此係中國法幣貶値之故、但若以當地幣制計算、則其數字當爲本公司有史以來之新紀錄也、菲島方面之營業過去數年之發展、已促使本公司遣派重要職員常駐其地、一九四〇年董事會決定在小呂宋改設總公司、藉以增强服務保戶之效力、業已於去年成立、由公司二職員主理、營業選擇、一切業務如簽發保單以及賠款等事宜、均由該分公可兩代表全權處理、無須轉由上海公可決定、因之辦事效率、大爲增加、</p>
<p>邁步前進</p>
<p>一九四〇年、中國戰事繼續進行、歐戰蔓延擴展、本公司在遠東營業範圍內各地居民之生活、莫不蒙極大之影響、但業務仍欣欣向榮、誠可視爲「友邦」之成功年度、本公　資產及盈餘基金均吿激增、吾人對於來年雖未能作準確之預測、但董事會咸信吾公司之準備、足可應付任何新局面、良以本公司業務人員之服務精神、絕未因特殊情形面受抨折、同時菲島及上海總公司辦事人員、亦均矢忠職守邁步前進也、</p>

<p>將近畢業的高中學生、莫不感到切身最人的問題、就是畢業後、當投考那一個學校、選讀那一科最適合、此外父有連帶發生的、就是自己的學力和興趣問題、經濟與出路等問題、悄形複雜、不易解答、從中學到大學、的確是一個嚴重應加審愼的階段、所以在這個時期、對於以上的各種問題、在未入大學之先、是値得考慮和研究的、</p>
<p>在升入大學問題中、最感重要的、就是目己有吾充份的準備、像關於閱讀方面、寫作方面、聽講方面、是吾已有充份的基本技能與習慣，如何精讀·略讀·扎記·應用辭典·使用圖書館·寫作大綱·論文、及其他基本智識等、</p>
<p>中學雖是普通科、但在高中三修業完畢的時候、就應該隨自己的興趣、選習科系、如擅長文學的、就應該入文科、擅長科學的、應該入理科或工科、擅長生理化學的就應該入醫科、惟好經商的、政治的、或敎育的、就應該入商科·政治經濟科、或師範科、歡喜佈道做宗敎事業的、就應該人神學科、有許多人選習科系、是以將來的出路着想、因此性情近於執敎者、却去習了法律、或有性近醫藥的、却去習了其他科系、結果就不能有多大的成功、其實缺乏人材的中國、任何一個職業、都是應該有出路的、</p>
<p>經濟當然是一個問題、有錢的家庭、當然可以隨意去進一個學校、甚至出國肄業、亦無困難、普通的家庭、要化五六百塊錢一年、送子弟入大學、確是不易、可是能够預先商請在校的校長敎師朋友等設法、不致失望、現在可不用愁了、有許多大學、有獎學金免費或借款等辦法、進了大學一年之後、即可請求、若是品畢兼優的話、第二年就容易得到、有的於中學畢業後、去做一年事、積蓄一點錢、再考大學、亦是極好的辦法、我以爲若是有計劃、有志向、願意去請求別人幫助經濟倒是一件比較容易解決的問題、</p>

<h3 id="c87">「開源」與「節流」 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 將伯</p>
<p>—「夜公司」及其他</p>
<p>「天下無如吃飯難」，到今天才被我們確切地感覺到它底富於眞理性了。試有今天市上的物價，沒有一樣不是在二倍三倍的漲上頂去，而必要的生活資料更是十倍二十倍。生活在職業圈裏的一羣呢，每月的薪給收入能有幾成幾成的加貼，只是鳳毛麟角而巳，多數是「故步自封」，生活、的鞭子鞭擊得他們無地可容了！</p>
<p>於是懦弱的，趨往於自殺了生。這實在是最最慘酷的生之悲劇；崛强點的激鬧起了工潮，但這何嘗不是工商界的不幸呢？如何勉度過這一個艱困的生活的階段，自然殷期於工商當局者的上下「諒解」，抱「同舟共濟」之懷。</p>
<p>說起「開源」，這如果是個一此時此地」的游資的擁有者，則也是最便捷不過的一回事，譬如買些外國股票，或是做點美票多頭，也嘸啥，其他如最普遍的囤下些洋米，煤球，甚或是肥皂，洋火之類，他們是不管大家的死活的。但一說到職業同人這方面來，委實是個極難談起的問題！因爲通常是從沒有沒本錢的「開源」法的！職業界同人們所具有的，便只是換取日常生活的最低資料的勞力而己！如果要急迫出一些「開源」的方法，我想自然也不得不打這「勞力」上鑽路道了。</p>
<p>在幾天前的報上，似乎讀到過一個補習學校主辦「夜公司」的簡訊，「夜公司」的宗旨據說是利用職業同人業餘的空間，爲社會服務，但這服務自然需要些酬報的，藉以補貼職業同人生活薪給上的不足。</p>
<p>我覺得這是値得一提的職業同人「開源」的方法。但這個事業現在還只見在倡議和試行中，前途的難點，譬如怎樣編成分門別類的技藝部分，足以担受社會各界付託；同時如何籲請社會各界的允予合作，和推進，等等，是値得大家的商榷的，但「夜公司」的推行的迫切，我相信一定能克服過來這一個過程裏的任何難處的。</p>
<p>變裏再說「節流」的問題了，同樣地這問題提出於一此時吒地」的有產老羣之前，是大可發揮的，在職業同人前，本來已是個過時的問題了，因爲一般同人的生活，雖在巳「節」到無可再「節」的地步了；但聽了一般的工商塲合中的關於應酬上的無謂舖張的靡費，的確有的地方還値得同人們的省悟與推行。譬如衣着與請客之類，有舊衣儘量應用舊衣吧，可以省去的酬醉請客，儘量加以節减甚至免去，目前最普遍的譬如婚喪送禮一項，一般人的觀念，都把禮的數量和生活資料的數量同時提高了，最起碼也得送上四元錢，今天六元八元十元錢的禮，眞已不算是闊綽的一回事了，實在這是不必要的！爲了生活的艱難，在這時節省仍應儘求這些糜費的减少，當事者應加以力避舖張爲原則，這樣「節流」一點，可見也着實還不失爲同人們的問題之一。</p>
<p>但一切話還應該說回來，所有職業同人們的「開源」與「節流」的問題，都還是近乎消極的手段，最直接而積極的解救同人生活的難關的，畢竟還有待於工商業的當局者的體諒與好的環境的到來吧。</p>

<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「這件事眞的說起來，你也有幾分不是！當然，我並不是說你和　小姐不應該發生這種關係，因爲她是硬生生地給我叔父騙去的，彼此根本就沒有什麼情感，甚至連名分也沒有；她愛你和你愛她，都可說是很正當的。何况你們平日的行爲父是同樣的十分純潔，即使你不是我的好朋友，我也會同情你們。只是，老兄弟，現在能不能讓我向你提出一個質問？請你說：我這幾年以來，是不是推心置腹的和你做朋友？假使楚的話，那末請你冉吿訴我，事前爲什麼不略略放一些風聲給我知道……？」</p>
<p>秋海業的充滿着熱淚的右眼，不覺便漸漸睜開了。</p>
<p>「如果我心裏早有幾分明白的話，今天的事一定就不會鬧得這樣糟了！」袁紹文很有力地說，臉上顯着十分痛惜的神氣。</p>
<p>悔恨頓時從秋海棠自己的心底裏擁了起來一，可是他還不知道應該對紹文怎樣的說才好。</p>
<p>「再說今天的事，我也未嘗旁觀，只是急得亂了主意，一心只想去把老胡拉來，讓他幫你講一個人情，不料我們回去得遲了一步，反把你毀了！我本來是可以跟他為上鬧翻的，———而且事實上已經差一些鬧翻了！但仔細想想，他是一個人，當然總有一口氣，這樣的事，要是臨到你我頭上，大概也不能沒有氣罷？何况這個壞主意也不是他想出來的。老弟，你想我終究還是他的小輩，再加又有老胡竭力從旁解勸，在這種情形之下，除掉急着把你送進醫院醫治之外，敎我應該再怎樣做呢？」</p>
<p>秋海棠還是覺得沒有什麼記好說。</p>
<p>「現在醫院是我送你進來的」，紹文揚着一條手指，連連向自已指了幾指。「你要是固執己意，一定不肯吃藥，一定不肯讓他們給你醫治，那就是仔心使我爲難了！……」（一〇五）</p>

<p>浙江路附近有一所陸稿薦，實在生意太好了，每日顧客盈門，後至者必遭向隅。店主亦因照顧乏術，並爲酬答顧客起見，特自前日起發售肉票」，持有肉票者隔日淸晨取肉，方免「客滿」之息云。</p>
<p>米價超過了一百四五十元關，窮人日日遊一餓鄕」，恐怕肉的滋味已三年未嘗了；而有錢人，一日無肉就要感覺不舒服，肉是富有脂肪啊！怪不得一個個畏得肥頭胖耳了。實在叫我做了肉舖老闆，一定非將肉價猛漲不可，因爲有老主顧在，生意絕對不生問題。他們視肉爲第三生命，僅次於米。</p>

<p>— 鍾子芒</p>
<p>「慈善家」施捨給一個乞丐一分錢，那個乞丐　着苦：「老爺，一分錢還不夠一個大餅但是「老爺」是怎麼會知道大餅的行情呢？解囊巳是一慷慨」—一分錢雖然在「老爺」的財產額中只是一個最小的「原子」，不過有時候在「老爺」的心中實在居了一個重要的地位。</p>
<p>且說「老爺」走向一家百貨公司—「老爺」是想買夔玻璃杯。</p>
<p>於是尋到器皿部；照例，這位「老爺」雖有錢，可是很知道來源的「艱難」，他是費　過不少的心血，雖然寗願給他兒子偷偷的零星支取去過燈紅酒綠的生活！自己不妨　苦些的，所以時時刻刻以「經濟」第一，當然，就是買隻玻璃杯，也得揀便宜的。</p>
<p>他叫夥計拿川貨色，夥計拿出一隻淡藍色的杯子來。</p>
<p>「老爺」拿在手裏看看問夥計多少價錢。</p>
<p>夥計回答他得付一元的價値。</p>
<p>「老爺」不高興了，他想：又是一元，十塊鈔票一打破便只剩了九塊了，這怎麼化得來？「老爺」是沒有年靑小夥子猶疑的，推說：質料太劣，父不牢，並且恐怕裝進熱水爆炸，「老爺」叙述他的理由後，決意走第二家了。</p>
<p>「老爺」父到了一家百貨公司，那兒不待找器皿部，便是一堆堆的玻璃杯，「老爺」一探問價錢是：「九角七分」，「老爺」敲敲玻璃，「老爺」很滿意，「老爺」私自說：只要九角七分，便宜得多啦，十塊打破還剩九塊多，便宜便宜，「老爺」也不想「貨比三家」了，買了下來。</p>
<p>於是「老爺」忽然想着了理髪，但他也得揀揀的。</p>
<p>「老爺」走進一家「九角九」的理髮舖，「老爺」又滿意把屁股對彈簧上一壓，「老爺」理髮了。</p>
<p>等到「老爺」付錢的時候，「老爺」拿出一塊法幣來要師傳找一找。</p>
<p>那師傳鄙夷的笑了笑，隨手授給一分錢，像給一個乞丐一樣。</p>
<p>「老爺」走到路上，一個乞丐仲出隻手來了：「老爺，我要餓死，餓死了……老爺。」</p>
<p>「老爺」把找餘的一分錢丟給乞丐，「老爺」完成了「慈善家」的風格。</p>
<p>那位理髮師與他的同行談着這位「老爺」的精刮；與他們的「失策」，可是如果把「九角九分」加上「一分」，這筆生意是不會得到的。</p>

<p>— 蕭朋</p>
<p>在現代的許多劇作家中，給人永遠不能磨滅印象的是夏衍。藝術至上主義的劇作家徒知舖張形式，不願戲的演出在社會上的影響如何。有些劇作家則是瞭解戲劇的使命，却因爲修養不够，使劇本不能形象化，陷於化裝演講的形式。夏衍劇作的優點在於不僅顧到社會價値，而且具有眞藝術價値。「上海屋籥下」，「一年閒」的產生，是他的正確戲劇理論的實踐。他的作品的獨特處，是內容的現實，形式的樸質—中國的，大衆的，是小市民所「喜聞樂見」的；他接受西洋戲劇的優點，可是他不會使自己的作品十足流於西洋化，他接受中國舊戲劇的傳統，然而他的作品不是舊劇的再現。人物典型刻劃之深，以及形式的洗練簡潔，在他的作品中是一貫的保存着。</p>
<p>過去—也可以說是現在，劇壇上曾經要求劇作家「表現上海」，顯然的，在「表現上海」這一工作上，夏衍所下的功夫最深，「上海屋簷下」和「都會的一角」，都是「表現上海」的力作。「愁城記」則是「表現」八一三以後「上海」的他的新著。我所看到的固然祇有「小劇塲」雜誌所介紹的一部份，但我覺得「愁城記」依然像他過去作品那樣淸秀可愛，且超過了其它「表現上海」的劇作。</p>
<p>「愁城記」的內容是針對着上海目前瘋在投機的現象，並指出投機家沒落的悲哀。像道樣現實的作品的演出，無論如何能够起着良好的作用。假如一個戲的演出須注意到「此時此地」的效果的話，「愁城記」可以作爲上海劇運的楷模的。同時，一切對於「此時此地」有害的劇本，即使有名家可以作爲號召，得嚴格摒棄不用。</p>
<p>「愁城記」與「爭强」先後被上海劇藝社採用爲上演的劇目。可是兩個戲在「此時此地」演出效果完全大相逕庭，前者於「上海」有利，後者於「上海」無益。我希望多演「愁城記」那樣的戲，少演「爭强」那樣的戲，我希望多演「表現上海」而允注意到「此時此地」效果的戲，這一重任，是該由態度一向嚴肅的上海劇藝社以及進步的戲劇工作者掮負起來的。</p>

<p>仙霓社是南方唯一崑班，猶北方之生慶社也。惟生廳是集合老伶工而成，仙霓純粹是新樂府學生，仙霓社在小世界。大世界出演時期，人村最盛，及後小生顧傳玠棄業，老生施傳鎮病故，自戰事發生，社員或逃避他鄉，或改行營生，在傳鈐·方傳芸·鄭傳鑑·王傳淞·華傳浩·周傳瑛·張傳芳·邵傳珺等，則跑江湖，落水路班，但仍不能過活，深恐流落他鄕，遂相偕回滬，萬衆一心，和衷共濟，重整仙霓社，在大新公司游藝塲出演，當時上座極盛，後父過東方書塲，不久社員分心，仙霓復作廣陵散，忽忽數年於茲矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Exposure of Internal Rifts in Germany: Hess Flees to England on the Opportunity; Political Views in Serious Conflict with Hitler; Hess Engaged in Heartfelt Conversation with Friends in England Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London: The British Prime Minister's residence issued a public statement last night, reporting that Nazi Party leader and Deputy Führer of Germany, Hess, had flown from Germany to Scotland. The statement read as follows: "On Saturday night, May 10th, a British patrol reported a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter plane flying over the Scottish coast towards Glasgow. At the time, it was believed that such a German plane could not carry enough fuel for a round trip between Germany and Scotland, so the report was deemed inaccurate. Shortly thereafter, a report was received that a Messerschmitt Bf 20 fighter plane, with its cannons loaded with bullets, had crashed near Glasgow. Subsequently, a German officer was seen to jump out of the plane with a parachute, his ankle broken. He was immediately taken to a hospital in Glasgow. The officer initially identified himself as 'Hahn,' and then stated that he was Rudolf Hess, carrying photographs of himself taken over the years to prove that he was indeed the German Deputy Führer, Hess. Several people present who knew Hess confirmed that the photos were indeed of Hess. Therefore, the British Foreign Office has dispatched a member who had close contact with Hess before the war to fly to Glasgow and meet him in the hospital." The Minister of Information, Cooper, personally read this public statement to journalists in a tense atmosphere at the Ministry of Information last night.</p>
<p>Hess, a man of imposing stature with piercing eyes, is one of the Nazi leaders. Although he has never been as prominent as Air Marshal Göring or Propaganda Minister Goebbels in the Nazi cabinet, it is said that he has considerable influence over Hitler. He is 45 years old and ranks third in the party, only behind Hitler and Göring. When the German army invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Hitler stated in parliament: "If I should die, my successor will be Göring, and after Göring, Hess. You should all regard them as leaders as you regard me." At times, besides Hitler, Hess's photos were the most frequently published in newspapers and shown in films. Last month, there was news that Hess had flown to Spain to deliver paintings to General Franco, but German officials subsequently denied it. Twelve days ago, Hess met with Mariano, the leader of the Spanish fascist group and Spanish Minister of the Navy, in Munich. After Hitler's failed coup in 1923, he was imprisoned with Hess. When Hitler came to power, Hess served as the director of the liaison department, providing Hitler with the information he needed. Hess spent his childhood in Egypt and later attended a British school in Alexandria. When the war broke out in 1914, he was unable to enter a British university. He usually only wore the brown shirts of the Sturmabteilung or the black shirts of the Schutzstaffel and never wore other clothes. He is generally mild-mannered, taciturn but efficient, and lives as simply as Hitler. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, rumors circulated that Hess, the third most powerful figure in the Nazi regime, who had escaped to Scotland by parachute, may be carrying peace terms. This incident reveals a rift in the German cabinet. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Doctors have examined Hess and found that his nerves are not deranged and that his physique is healthy. Hess did not bring any peace proposals. He came in opposition to the Nazi authorities and has now been transferred to an undisclosed destination. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Mr. Kirkpatrick, who worked at the British Embassy in Berlin from 1933 to 1938 and had a close friendship with Hess, met with the Nazi leader last night and easily recognized him. It is reported that during the meeting, Hess spoke freely without any reservations. Mr. Kirkpatrick attended the conferences in Godesberg, Berchtesgaden, and Munich and served as a counselor at the British Embassy and once as chargé d'affaires. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Turkey: The wife of the leader of the German National Socialist Party in the capital, Hess, arrived here by plane at 7:00 PM today. Only after disembarking did she learn that her husband had disappeared. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Berlin: The German National Socialist Party issued the following official statement yesterday: "Party comrade Hess has been suffering from a serious illness for many years. Therefore, Führer Hitler had strictly forbidden him from flying. It is known that Hess flew out by plane on the 10th of this month and has not yet returned. A letter left by Hess reveals signs of mental disorder. Upon learning of this, the Führer immediately ordered the arrest of his adjutant, as only his adjutant knew that Hess was traveling by plane. The adjutant did not prevent this action beforehand, nor did he report this violation of the Führer's orders afterward. The National Socialist Party deeply regrets this. If Comrade Hess has not been killed in a plane crash, he may have encountered other unfortunate events." (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a statement from the National Socialist Party, the documents left by Hess clearly prove that Hess fantasized about making personal contact with old friends in England in order to achieve Anglo-German friendship. News from London has confirmed that Hess was injured upon landing in Scotland at the location he wanted to visit. The party knows that Hess has been ill for several years and has recently been using various treatments. His actions have proven that he is suffering from delusions. Hess deeply understood Hitler's peace proposals. He mistakenly believed that by personal sacrifice, he could stop the development of the destruction of the British Empire. Hess's responsibilities were limited to party affairs. The documents he left behind do not have clear opinions explaining the path he took and the consequences of various steps, which can serve as clear proof. The National Socialist Party regrets that Hess fell into this delusion. There is absolutely no change in the continuation of the war that Germany was forced to participate in. Hitler declared in a recent speech that this war will continue until the current British authorities are overthrown or they are prepared for peace. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: People in Berlin believe that Hess's sudden flight to Scotland is a result of years of illness. He has consulted many doctors, but has not recovered his health, and his condition has recently worsened. Hess served as an air force officer during the last World War and suffered lung injuries. Later, he suffered from increasingly severe stomach problems and insomnia and mental disorders. Famous doctors were helpless. Although he lived a very peaceful lifestyle, he was unable to reduce the progression of his illness. Hitler has been concerned about this. He appointed Hess as a party representative eight years ago and has gradually reduced his responsibilities. His appointment of General Göring as his successor at the outbreak of the European War can serve as clear proof. According to well-informed sources in the National Socialist Party, Hess's duties have recently been reduced as much as possible due to health reasons. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>

<p>Berlin: According to responsible sources here, Führer Hitler met with French Associate Darlan yesterday in the presence of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The meeting between the French Deputy Prime Minister and the highest German political figures at a certain location at the end of last week is considered by informed sources to be a preliminary step in German-French political and economic cooperation. Germany and France are negotiating for France to take on an important role in establishing Hitler's "New Europe" and to turn Africa into a huge raw material warehouse for Europe, developing and supplying Europe as much as possible.

<p>Berlin: The German National Socialist Party issued an official gazette yesterday, announcing that Führer Hitler had taken over the office of Party Representative Hess. The content of the gazette is as follows: "The Party Representative Office will now be renamed 'National Socialist Party President's Office.' The President will be assumed by myself. Bormann will serve as the Secretary-General of the President's Office." Signed, Hitler, May 12, 1941. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hitler has ordered the arrest of Hess's subordinates. Hitler had previously forbidden Hess from using airplanes, but the Nazi third leader still stole a plane and left a note for the doctor. Hitler's order to arrest Hess's staff stated, "These members did not prevent Hess from flying privately beforehand, nor did they report it afterward." Hess recently appeared in public during the German parliamentary assembly on Sunday when Hitler gave a speech reporting on the Balkan campaign. When the meeting opened, Hess followed Hitler and Göring from the cloakroom into the hall, wearing a brown ritual uniform. Hess sat next to Hitler during his speech. Hess's most recent speech was on May 1st at the Augsburg metal factory, praising German industrial giants and awarding newsreel commendations. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">The German Führer Deserted by His Inner Circle: Londoners Both Shocked and Delighted <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>London: British diplomatic commentators are commenting on the unprecedented and peculiar situation faced by Britain, namely the arrival of the German Deputy Führer Hess, Hitler's most trusted confidant and who knows all of Germany's war plans. Commentators are speculating on Hess's motives for flying to Glasgow, generally believing that Hess's move may indicate a serious rift in the Nazi Party and unanimously asserting that Hess fled for his life. Officials are maintaining silence about Hess's conversation with the current military attaché to the Foreign Office, former First Secretary of the British Embassy in Germany, Mr. Kirkpatrick. However, some political experts believe that British Prime Minister Churchill may make a statement. British political experts believe that Hess's escape will cause an astonishing reaction in Germany, as Hess is generally recognized by the Germans as one of the Führer's most trusted personnel. These experts find it laughable that the Germans consider Hess a madman, pointing out that Hess attended the last German parliament meeting and sat side by side with Hitler. It is also said that Hess was ordered by Hitler to go to Madrid last week. The British Broadcasting Corporation has been broadcasting the news to the German and Italian people that Hess has defected to correct the German official version that Hess died after jumping from an airplane. The British news was broadcast to the two countries this morning and is scheduled to be repeated all day today. Mr. Bruce, a foreign affairs reporter for the "Daily Mail" who knew the Nazi leaders quite well before the war, believes that a violent conflict has occurred within the Nazi Party. Because Hess feared that he would encounter the same disaster as some of Hitler's confidants in the 1934 purge, he fled for his life. Mr. Bruce also said that Hess must be dissatisfied with his colleagues' ambition to conquer the world, so he did this. He also said that the leaders of the Third Reich's army, navy, and air force must remember that Hess knows everything about Germany. This escape must have led to a complete divulging of secrets and that these people may only be frustrated at this time. As for Hitler being abandoned by his most trusted person, he must also be greatly disappointed. If Hess has betrayed him, then who else can he trust? The "Daily Telegraph," in commenting on the German official statements, said that judging from the wording of this peculiar statement, the Nazi Party knew that Hess had escaped by taking advantage of a convenience that these people could not control and hoped that no one would believe any statements made by Hess that were unfavorable to these people. Therefore, they asserted that Hess was mentally disordered. This German statement may indicate that there is a party split in Germany, and it can be seen that the situation in Nazi Germany is not good everywhere. Other commentators in the press believe that the Germans' claim that Hess is crazy is because Hitler is deeply afraid that Hess will tell Britain the most important German information. The News Federation ridiculed the German news that Hess was crazy, saying that Hess apparently chose an airplane that did not have enough gasoline to send him back. This plane needed to be driven by someone with special skills who could drive an extremely fast plane, and a mentally ill person could not drive such a plane to reach a specific location. Aviation experts, commenting on Hess's flight, said that Hess must have found it very difficult to use even a non-electric compass to navigate this plane, because a single aviator could not use a compass. Hess may have chosen a more northerly route to avoid London's air defenses and the German airfields in French territory where German bombers are ready to depart at any time. The route Hess followed was easy to navigate with a map and compass. British people were shocked and delighted to hear the news broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation at midnight. Later, they saw the early newspapers carrying this news with large headlines such as "German Deputy Führer Quits," "Hitler's Deputy Flees Germany," "Hess Arrives in Scotland," and "Hitler's Deputy Hess Captured in Glasgow."

<p>The "New York Times" recently published an article discussing the flight of the German Deputy Führer Hess to Central England, stating that Hess's move, on the surface, is purely a fact of escape. Hess's move is not to save his own life, but a reaction in the party or the country that made him risk going to England. Regardless of the reason for this nominally Nazi leader's trip to England, there will be a huge reaction in Germany. This is a fact that is enough to affect the overall situation of the war. It is not difficult to imagine the impact on Hitler, as Hess is Hitler's "shadow" and the closest person to the German Führer among the Nazi Party leaders. Who can know the dark secrets, hidden tensions, and deep jealousy between the Nazi Party leaders? Who can know the truth behind Germany's engagement in this war, and why? This special film is an interlude performed in the amazing play performed by the entire Nazi Party. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Comparative Observation of US and Soviet Attitudes <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The "non-participation in the war" of the United States and the "peace policy" of the Soviet Union have kept them outside the vortex of war for several years. But the price they have paid separately is already very high. For example, the United States watched France fall last year, and the Soviet Union endured the German and Italian sweep of the Balkans. Even now, they are still being drawn to the edge of the war. Whether they can ultimately avoid being drawn into the vortex is a huge question that shrouds the hearts of people all over the world.</p>
<p>Although the various measures taken by the United States in recent months have not abandoned the principle of "non-participation in the war" in principle, the objective facts are not the same. The question is whether the participation in the war of materials will progress to positive military action. As for the Soviet Union, although it has not abandoned its proclaimed "peace policy" and is striving for domestic construction, it is also promoting national mobilization and preparation at the same time. Its current problem is whether it will further compromise with Germany and Italy in the Near East or whether it will resist the German and Italian extension into the Near East and Turkey. No matter which of these two possibilities is taken, the reality is that they are drawing into war.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of US participation in the war, based only on the situation of Germany and Italy, the United States does not seem to have any direct need to take action now; and the German and Italian army, navy, and air force are in fact far away across the ocean and cannot start a war with the United States. Based on the situation in Japan, the United States has no need to take positive military action unless it is attacked or Japan attacks Britain. After examining the various measures taken by Germany, Italy, and Japan in recent months, there are no signs on the surface that they are prepared to go to war with the United States immediately. Even if the United States provides more large-scale assistance to Britain and engages in protection and transportation, it is difficult to imagine that Germany and Italy will have any serious reaction immediately. It must be known that the focus of the current problem is still on the Soviet Union, and the United States is only trying to cope, which is in a passive position. Why is this said? If there is indeed another compromise between the Soviet Union and Germany in the works, attempting to divide the Near East, then the land defense of the British Empire, even if only to deal with Germany, would require the United States to provide assistance with manpower, let alone the Soviet Union participating in the invasion group! At that time, for the sake of the overall situation of the world and for the sake of its own future security, the United States would of course have to take major action and go to war. Therefore, for the sake of the United States, even if it is difficult for itself and the Soviet Union to work together, at least it should prevent the Soviet Union from cooperating with Germany and Italy at a considerable price. The so-called price is only war! On the other hand, there are many disagreements in the current rumors of Soviet-German compromise on the Near East. Based on common sense, it is difficult to quickly believe that the Soviet Union would take such a self-binding action, putting itself in an unprecedented crisis. If Germany and Italy extend their power into the Near East, the Soviet Union will inevitably lose an ally in Turkey. As for how to get along well with Germany, Italy, and Japan afterwards, it will become a problem at any time and in any place. It is better to take a strong stand and resist the German and Italian involvement in the Near East, then in today's international situation, it can only stand on the same front as countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Leaving the purely self-interested point of view, what people cannot help but think about is the issue of standing and principles. There are clearly many irreconcilable contradictions between the aggressor countries Germany, Italy, and Japan; however, their mutually echoing acts of aggression are at least built on one point of agreement, which is to oppose the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Several years ago, the Soviet Union put forward the slogan of opposing aggression, hoping to unite all the remaining countries to resist the advance of violence. The unfortunate failure of this movement at that time should of course be attributed to the short-sightedness and prejudice of the rulers of the United Kingdom and France. Even now, at this critical moment, facing the fierce edge of the aggressive forces, the few major anti-aggressive countries that remain in the world are still unable to achieve consensus, which is very painful. Because of the different national systems between these countries, there are various contradictions, but these contradictions, compared to the current common crisis and the resulting crisis for the future of all mankind, then the so-called contradictions are really nothing. And if the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate one day, the world's forces of justice will not be able to unite for one day, and the fierce flames of the aggressive forces will not be able to be suppressed for one day, giving it the opportunity to defeat them one by one. This is obvious, and probably most people in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries can clearly recognize it. If the forces of justice can ultimately be united and human civilization will ultimately trend towards prosperity, then now is the most urgent time for the rulers of each country to suppress prejudice and seek cooperation!</p>

<p>Rome: After the disappearance of German National Socialist Party Deputy Leader Hess, political figures here are quite shaken. Hess has visited Italy several times and has many friends in Italy. Although they knew that he was ill, they did not expect his ending to be so tragic. After the news spread here, important Italian figures flocked to the German Embassy to inquire about the news. The media here were too late to receive the news and did not have time to publish it. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Former Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Kurusu, had a personal friendship with Hess and expressed great surprise at the news of Hess's flight to England, saying that he did not understand why Hess had done this at all. It is said that Hess was very pro-Japanese, and when they met last November, there was no sign of mental abnormality. Sources in Japan said that Hess's move before the implementation of a blitzkrieg against Britain should not have any political impact, because Berlin said that he was mentally disordered.

<p>Glasgow: Hess carried his own medicines with him on Saturday night. Because the gasoline ran out, Hess jumped out of the plane. It was only a few seconds before the plane crashed and was destroyed. There was no one else in the plane, and there were no bombs or explosives in the plane. A hospital examination of Hess's body revealed that his heart was weak and he had a bladder disease, so he carried his own medicines. Hess took off from Augsburg at 6:30 PM and arrived in western Scotland five hours later. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Those in the know who have compared the texts of the British and German announcements both believe that this matter was planned in advance and was not an accidental landing. Hess's landing site was on the estate of the Duke of Hamilton in Strathaven. Hess apparently knew where it was because he immediately asked others to introduce him to the Duke of Hamilton. The Duke is the former Marquess of Clydesdale and flew over Mount Everest in 1933. He has not been involved in peace movements recently. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<p>Glasgow - Deputy Führer of Germany, Hess, who intentionally landed here on Saturday night, was first discovered by a farmer named MacYun. Today, MacYun told reporters from the Associated Press about his capture of Hess. MacYun heard the sound of a plane crashing in his house and rushed out to investigate. He saw Hess rolling on the ground, trying to free himself from his parachute. Hess seemed to have no other injuries except for his ankle. He carried many photographs and documents proving his identity. Soon, the police arrived at MacYun's farmhouse, took the documents, and then notified the Foreign Office. Hess was then sent to the hospital, where it was verified that Hess's ankle was fractured, and he had heart and bladder problems. He also brought medicine from Germany to treat these conditions. MacYun told the Associated Press reporter, "At that time, I was outside. I heard the plane flying overhead, and everyone else had gone to bed. Then a plane crashed in the field. When I ran over, I saw the plane was on fire. When I saw a parachute falling in the darkness, I was quite alarmed. I looked up and saw a man descending slowly with the parachute. I immediately determined that the person was a German airman. I went back to the house for help, but they were all asleep. In my haste, I looked around for a weapon, but there was nothing except a weed. Because I was afraid of losing the airman, I rushed back alone. I saw a person lying on the ground with a collapsed parachute. He smiled at me, and I helped him up. He thanked me. I saw that his foot was injured, so I helped him into the house. At this time, my mother and sister had gotten up and were making tea, but he didn't want to drink tea. We told him that we in this country are very fond of tea. He smiled and said, 'I never drink tea so late at night. I only need a glass of water.' We immediately notified the military authorities. At the same time, the German started casually chatting with us and showed us photos of his young son, speaking with great pride. He said he had left Germany four hours ago and landed because it was getting dark. From his manner of speaking, I knew that he was an educated person. Although he had a foreign accent, his English was very clear. He completely understood what we were saying. He was tall and burly, over six feet tall, and wore a beautiful flight suit. His watch and the bracelet engraved with his name were both made of gold. He did not mention the details of his flight, but he seemed to find this flight, which we thought was dangerous, quite amusing. He seemed confident that he would be treated well and repeatedly expressed his happiness that he landed safely. He was very polite to my mother and sister, bowing when entering and leaving. He thanked us deeply, but he was very concerned about his parachute. He said to me, 'I want to save this parachute because my life is entirely dependent on this parachute.' He would not tell us who he was, and we didn't want to ask too much, because we thought he was just a paratrooper who had been shot down. When the officers arrived, he greeted them with a smile and said that he had no weapons and raised his hands to be searched. Then the officers took him away. From his clothes, gold watch, etc., we knew that he was an important person. His leather boots were also very beautiful, as fine as his gloves," he said. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Washington - It is believed here yesterday that the new peace offensive in the Sino-Japanese war is yet another attempt to make the United States keep its fleet stationed in the Pacific, regardless of the situation in the Atlantic. Observers believe that the peace rumors may have originated in Washington, but most of them came from Tokyo. The spread of these rumors is intended to probe what naval policy Italy will adopt if Japan actually advances southward. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt discussed the situation with Australian Prime Minister Menzies yesterday, and Menzies also discussed with many State Department officials, possibly even discussing US-Australian cooperation to deal with any Japanese action in the South Pacific. Informed sources said that the proposal for a truce in the Sino-Japanese war has not been taken seriously here but is considered an attempt to scare the United States into fearing that the Japanese army, once free from the war in China, may seize the Dutch East Indies. It is also believed here that the suggestion for Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke to visit Washington has not been supported by responsible parties. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The United States Will Never Tolerate Japan</p>
<p>Washington - Today, American newspapers criticized Japan's intention to make peace with China so that it could shift its troops in China for other purposes, but Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is unwilling to accept any mediation except by the United States. The Scripps newspapers published Simms's argument, saying that it can be asserted that unless Japan first agrees to discuss peace based on the Nine-Power Treaty, there is absolutely no possibility that the United States will accept the position of mediator. For strategic and principal reasons, the United States will never create a peace of temporary expediency that will harm the future for China. The New York Times editorial said that Japan has been fighting in China for more than four years and has not conquered China, but has consumed much of its own resources and sacrificed the world's goodwill toward Japan. Although it has Chinese land, it has not benefited economically, and the troops it must maintain in China are hurting its domestic economy. Now it sees richer treasures elsewhere and wants to free its troops to seize them. Japan is like a naughty child stealing candy, already taking a handful of candy from one jar, but wanting to steal more coveted candy from another jar, but it cannot get it without letting go of what it already holds.

<p>Chongqing - Fighting on the Jin-Yu border is intensifying. Japanese troops invading Jiaji continue to invade northwest towards Fengmenkou, Xichengliu, and other places, continuing to engage in fierce battles with the Chinese army. Fierce battles are taking place on the mountains from the northwest of Yuanqu to the foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains east of Xia County. Wangmaozhen and other places north of Yuanqu are still in bloody battles. In order to thoroughly prevent the Japanese army from crossing the river and invading, the Huadong authorities have transferred a large army from Tongguan and Luoyang to cross the Yellow River and go north to the front line to participate in the war. The fighting on the north bank of the Yellow River is gradually becoming fierce. (Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military sources say that the Japanese army clearly intends to encircle and eliminate the Chinese army based in the strategically important Zhongtiao Mountains. However, recent news arriving in Chongqing has led military observers to doubt whether a major offensive has already begun. According to intelligence, although the Japanese troops in Shanxi have increased by at least one division, and many have been moved from the north to the south, no additional troops have been sent to China. Therefore, from an overall perspective, there is no major concentration in the Yellow River region or the Pinghan Road area. Therefore, the number of Japanese troops is not sufficient to conduct a major battle. It is speculated here that the current offensive in southern Shanxi may be of a preparatory nature, preparing for a major offensive when more troops are obtained. At the same time, military intelligence says that the Japanese column that started a northward attack from Jingmen in central Hubei was driven back yesterday, with 2,000 killed or wounded. Military intelligence also says that the Japanese army has divided into three routes to attack Huizhou in eastern Guangdong, with the main column totaling 10,000 people. Fierce fighting continues in Boluo County. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Front-line war reports received in Chongqing today state that the Japanese are currently launching offensives in southern Shanxi, northern Henan, northern Hubei, and Guangdong Province simultaneously, on a scale not seen since the Battle of Wuhan. Southern Shanxi and northern Hubei are particularly noteworthy, as it appears that their goal is to seize Xi'an and Hanzhong and cut off traffic between Sichuan Province and the Northeast. According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese are currently using divisions transferred from Manchuria to fight in southern Shanxi. So far, the division numbers of three divisions have been discovered. It is also heard that the Japanese on the front lines of Hubei and Fujian provinces have concentrated a force of seven divisions. The war in Guangdong Province is taking place near Boluo on the East River. All sectors of the Chinese public are paying close attention to the recent statements by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Minister Tojo that the Japanese army intends to resolve the China Incident with all its strength.

<h3 id="e30">American Female Writer, Ms. Clare Boothe, Talks About Creative Experience <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, American writers have been coming to China for research one after another. The famous playwright Ms. Clare Boothe recently visited Chongqing with her husband, Henry Luce (editor of American magazines such as "Time" and "Fortune"). This is a fragment of Ms. Boothe's talk published in the New York Times, which is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"I don't like most people, and I have very few close friends in my life," Ms. Boothe began.</p>
<p>It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when she asked the servant for a pot of boiling water, a lemon, and a small knife. She cut the lemon, squeezed the juice into the boiling water, and then drank it. Ms. Boothe then talked about how she unintentionally wrote the sensational play "The Women."</p>
<p>"One night," she said, "Henry and I went to a nightclub. I went into the women's room alone, and he waited outside the door for a full hour and a half. When I came out, he asked me what I was doing inside. I said I was chatting with the girls. He asked what we were talking about. I didn't expect him to notice women's affairs for the first time. He was an extremely curious man; if something didn't arouse his interest, it was fine, but if it stirred his curiosity, he wouldn't let it go. So I thought I would briefly tell him what we had just talked about. I didn't expect that once I started thinking, I was surprised to find that all we talked about was gossiping.</p>
<p>"We traveled to White Sulphur over the weekend. As soon as we arrived, he was called back to the company. At this time, I was still thinking about the women in the women's room and their secrets. I felt really bored being left alone here. Involuntarily, I picked up paper and pen and pieced together these fragments on the card table, making them each tell their own stories. I wrote for three consecutive days, following the simple story. After three days, the script for "The Women" was born."</p>
<p>Boothe is accustomed to writing with a fountain pen and ink, and she writes very quickly. She has a habit of rereading while writing. If she used a typewriter instead of a pen, she would always reread the last few lines and stop there. She doesn't cherish her original manuscript. When the theater owner asked her to modify a few small sections in the original script, she didn't hesitate to rewrite the entire play, but she had to do it herself and didn't allow others to do it for her. She uses this method to protect her copyright. She said she would rather write books because books express her own thoughts and no one would dare to make presumptuous suggestions.</p>
<p>She is a writer who stays up late, but she has changed her mind since her second marriage. Because her husband is busy all day and only has time to rest at night, if she works at night, the couple will never see each other. In order to concentrate on writing, she often shuts herself in a room and refuses all social engagements. In New York, she often disconnects the phone, and in Greenwich Village, she often pretends to have gone out to play golf, swim, boat, or do other entertainment.</p>
<p>Generally, people who write scripts often spend a lot of time thinking about the plot, but she doesn't pay much attention to it. She said, "In the script 'Kiss the Boys Goodbye', I killed off the male protagonist twice, thinking the layout was extremely novel. Before long, I realized that this was just the old trick of detective novelists. So now I write whatever comes to mind and no longer pretend. The latest work I started is, in terms of its basic plot, almost the same as the story of Tristan and Isolde (a medieval love tragedy)."</p>
<p>Ms. Boothe claims that she knew in her childhood that she would either become an actress or a playwright. For a period of time, she performed on stage, but she performed terribly and knew she had no hope. Later, she got married, and for several years, she mixed with a group of people who had nothing to do with books and writing, and was almost assimilated by them. But after her divorce, her only thought was to write for a magazine and find a job that would make her stand out.</p>
<p>She wrote three scripts, all of which were aborted. Then she wrote "Abide With Me," which tells the story of a young woman who marries a drunkard and is scouted by Broadway. "The Women," written in 1936, was not initially appreciated by critics, but it eventually caused a sensation and established her position. Two years later, she published "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," which was also severely criticized, but ultimately achieved considerable success. The last one she wrote, "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," was slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Boothe's recent work, "Europe in the Spring," combines facts and theory, and is the crystallization of her travels in Europe on the eve of the outbreak of the European war. In February 1939, she went to Europe as a journalist, traveling to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. At this time, the situation in Europe was changing drastically, and she gained a lot of insight wherever she went. In June, she returned to New York and wrote a 10,000-word essay about her experiences, which she sent to her husband Luce, the editor of Life magazine. Later, she felt that she had more to say than in the essay, so she retreated to the countryside, worked hard, and completed the entire manuscript in six weeks, naming it "Europe in the Spring."</p>
<p>After the book was published, its appeal and sales were unprecedented compared to her previous plays. She purely used an American perspective to analyze the ills of Europe and used the techniques of writing plays to develop insightful theories, making it fascinating. This is another new creative experience for her.</p>
<p>Ms. Boothe is now in Chongqing.</p>

I believe that we are forced to take the first path, which is to deter or defeat the aggressors with strength. As for the convoy method, I believe that this method may not be sufficient to solve the current problem. Therefore, we may need to implement a new national defense system to ensure that our goods can arrive safely in Britain. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Since the national thrift and nation-building savings movement concluded the first phase of the competition on January 28, in order to take into account the development of other movements, we have temporarily avoided superficial activities. However, the second phase of work has progressed in an orderly manner, and the increase in numbers has been able to meet the predetermined goals. According to the reports received by the savings promotion association from various branches at the end of April, the total amount of savings coupons is close to 300 million yuan, which shows that the upward trend of our country's savings movement has created a situation of taking advantage of the situation, and the future is promising. In addition, the recent policy of the savings promotion association focuses on practicing thrift to open up sources of savings and generally promoting the purchase of small-denomination savings coupons, with the aim of being lasting. Enthusiastic people with savings capacity in various places continue to participate in large numbers. For example, Dai Enchao from Suixi County, Guangdong, purchased savings coupons worth 470,000 yuan as an example. Tan Bingcheng's family in Kaixian, Sichuan, is only of middle-class background, but when the Dongchuan Post Office sent personnel to promote the campaign, they also purchased coupons worth 10,000 yuan to help the investment in the cause of nation-building. Among the institutions, schools, and organizations that used funds to purchase savings coupons, the Guangzhou Bay Yizhi Middle School's 700,000 yuan was the most. (Dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>The foreign rice purchased by the Concession authorities arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 11th). Jardine Matheson's "Mingsheng" vessel brought 22,500 bags, and Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Hanyang" vessel brought 9,696 bags, totaling 31,196 bags. It is heard that the second batch may also arrive in Shanghai this week. In addition to the foreign rice, the "Hanyang" vessel also brought 3,423 bags of corn. (Concession)</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice fell in the morning yesterday but rose at noon, and the market stabilized later. As a result, although it was still a little lower than the noon closing price of the day before yesterday, it was slightly higher than the evening closing price of the day before yesterday. However, according to the observation of people in the industry, the price of rice has fallen sharply by more than 30 yuan, and it can now enter a consolidation phase. It is difficult to expect the market price to improve, but major ups and downs may have to wait until after the Dragon Boat Festival. At that time, Hong Kong rice and Vietnamese rice will be able to arrive in port one after another, and the movements of sales, the amount of inventory, and the high and low production prices will all affect the rise and fall of the rice market. When the market opened yesterday morning, because Hong Kong rice had already been unloaded and was waiting for sale, and the French authorities had announced the loading of 20,000 tons of Vietnamese rice, and because of the weak wind of the day before yesterday, the prices of various foreign rice fell sharply by 3-4 yuan. The lowest price of small glutinous rice spot was 113 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 was 123 yuan. After the price fell, the cargo owner refused to sell again, and the real buyers also took advantage of the low price to add to their purchases, and said that the newly arrived Hong Kong rice still had to go through customs clearance procedures before it could be sold publicly. Therefore, the buying sentiment turned active, and the price of each rice market immediately recovered by 4-5 yuan. The closing price of small glutinous rice rose to 118 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 rose to 125.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The original package of English China Steamship (one stone and two dou and a half) also rose from low to high. Saigon No. 1 was from 141 yuan to 143-4 yuan, and broken rice was from 111 yuan to 112.5 yuan. The transaction volume of English China Steamship was more than 600 tons, and the spot rice was 14-15,000 bags.</p>
<p>The road for thick and thin japonica rice and glutinous rice is still limited. Fortunately, the market is also rare, and the cargo owners are unwilling to sell lightly. Under persistence, it continues to present a fixed situation. Xijing is still 138 yuan, Wujing is 136 yuan second to 133 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice is 133.5 yuan second to 132 yuan. As for Hong Kong Baiyuan, it opened at 115.5 yuan and 117 yuan.</p>

<p>The flour market was initially weak but then stabilized. At the opening of the morning market, foreign flour fell with the price of rice, and more than 200,000 bags of fixed flour were read, and people's hearts were not encouraged, so the market price fell. Jinlong brand Kanfen only opened at 30 yuan 05-6 cents, Huabiao brand at 30 yuan 09 cents, Zhonglou brand at 31 yuan, and foreign fort flour at 31 yuan. The rate of decline can also be said to be rapid. However, it was heard later that the gold market rose sharply and the price of rice recovered slightly. Buyers who took advantage of the low price to buy gradually became numerous. For a time, the buying sentiment turned strong, and the selling price of each commodity was 2-3-4 cents higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>The transaction of wheat yesterday was as light as usual. The source of inland China has been dry for a long time, and the stock of goods in the concession is also very few. In the midst of the shutdown of each factory, there was no new transaction of wheat. It is heard that the Japanese factory slightly increased its intake at the retail market, and the price was 46-7 yuan, which was also a loose drop of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes did not have any special changes. The price of corn continued to fall, with more than 3,000 bags of spot goods and 200 tons of futures being traded. The price of Saigon old goods was 31 yuan (outside warehouse), and the price of new goods was 31 yuan 3.5 cents to 32 yuan. The price of English China Steamship was 60 yuan to 59 yuan (bank warehouse), the price of Dutch white corn was 34 yuan to 33 yuan 2 cents, and the price for delivery from the end of April to the beginning of May was 62 yuan. The price of yellow corn was 34 yuan 2 cents to 34 yuan 8 cents (bank warehouse). The price of yellow soybeans apparently declined, but secretly rose. Although the sales of oil mills were not smooth, they continued continuously, and the potential was quite tight. Yesterday, more than 3,000 bags of Guidet beans were opened, and the price was 45 yuan to 45 yuan 8 cents. This street sold 300 bags of Tianjin beans, and the price was 48 yuan to 48 yuan 3 cents. The price of 200 bags of Tianjin green beans was 46 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices were flat for all exchanges. The black market for British and American exchange rates turned soft while being stable. Speculators came to cover shorts at the opening in the morning. Importers had huge amounts of foreign rice to settle, and they were fortunate to have a sale to a certain American bank, which was tight but slight. Near noon, it was suddenly heard that American warships had postponed the news of the convoy, and Chinese banks and speculators rose to cover shorts. At noon, the remaining price rose to the 6,500 yuan mark again, and the trend was sharper. The settlement of US exchange rates was 5 yuan 34375, and the British exchange rates followed tightly to three offices 28125. In the afternoon, the supply intention of foreign banks was slightly better, and the pulling power of speculation weakened. Although the price of gold stepped up, the noon market stabilized. The final central gold was three offices 28125, tight 03125, and US gold was five yuan 34375, tight 0625. Transactions were not rare.</p>
<p>The settlement of foreign rice was also huge.</p>
<p>Since the morning foreign telegraphic silver market, British, American, and Indian have unanimously not changed. The US exchange rate rose by nine points against Shanghai, while the rest were flat. The central listed prices were flat for all exchanges in the early opening of the domestic market.

After the opening, it immediately softened to the point where it was difficult to settle at the above prices. The speculator did not obtain the five yuan 40625 of this month's pull. HSBC's listed prices changed more for each exchange rate. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 24.50%, the British Bank had a slight supply, and the situation tended to stabilize for a long time. Until after 10:30, an importing rice firm came to pull this month's US gold five yuan 375, and the price of gold stepped up. A Chinese bank also came to cover shorts, pulling into the May period. Speculators also absorbed from it, and all pulled into this month and next month's US exchange rates of five yuan 375 and 34375. At the closing of the noon market, US gold was five yuan 34375, and the British exchange rate followed tightly to three offices 28125.</p>
<p>The bank still has supply.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, although the price of gold rose slightly to stop, the speculators pulled less of the five or six months of US gold five yuan 34375, and the bank was still willing to supply it, so they stopped pulling. The market trend became sluggish until the evening closing at 4 o'clock. From spot goods to the June period, the British exchange rate was three offices 28125, and US gold was five yuan 34375. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the British was tight 03125, and the US was tight 0625.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Swap Already Arrived, Gold Market Returns to Rise <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot red black market in gold has risen back up. The price has already broken through the 6,500 yuan mark. People's hearts are strong because of today's swap. It is rumored that the exchange brokers and gold shops and four securities firms will knock on the big premium, requiring 50-60 yuan. In addition, it is widely rumored that the American warships have extended the news of the convoy, and the foreign exchange has already settled foreign rice. Chinese banks and speculators are covering shorts, which has led to a tighter trend. The short side is even more eager to cover. Securities firm Defu and exchange broker Dafeng added leverage and leaned in. Yida, Deda, Xinyuan, and Chengji followed the buying trend. The price gradually rose from 36,445 yuan in the morning to 6,520 yuan before the evening closing, finally rising by 101 yuan to 6,515 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 780,000 taels. The cash was first sold by Hesheng to Zhongxing for 50 taels, and the price was 220 yuan higher than the term delivery. Gold shop Chengji suddenly came to sell to Xinfengyong for 200 taels and Xianghe for 160 taels, pressing down to 200 yuan. In the afternoon, Yida, Yongfengyu, Taikangrun, and Xianghe sold a total of 100 taels to Shunyuan, which was 190 yuan higher. Wanfeng sold 50 taels to Shunyuan, which was 200 yuan higher.

Then it retreated slightly to 6,400,1000 yuan. Yida, Defu, Xinfengyong, and Decheng came to increase, rising to 6,470 yuan, sold by Tong Kangyong and Hengji. It is common to see a decline, retreating twice to 6,445 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, foreign exchange softened, and Chengda, Deda, Yida, and Defu tended to increase. The price rose to around 6,460 yuan, circling for a long time. When the good news was heard, exchange brokers Dafeng and Xinfengshui also increased sharply, and the rise suddenly accelerated, jumping out of the 6,500 yuan level, reaching 6,505 yuan. Chengji and Hengji sold out, and Deda sold again. Those who sold at a limited price retreated to 6,485 yuan, but Defu's increasing force did not stop, and it was again pushed to 6,907 yuan. The noon closing was 6,503 yuan, and after the closing it retreated to 6,499 yuan. Xinfengyong entered and raised it to 6,505 yuan. The 2 pm opening was 6,510 yuan, which was 7 yuan higher. Then it rose again to 6,515 yuan. Shunyuan and the silver firm helped to sell, and they immediately pressed down more than 30 yuan, retreating to 6,480 yuan, but people's hearts were upwards. Xinyuan, Defu, Dafeng, and Wanfeng absorbed one after another, and then raised 40 yuan, reaching 6,520 yuan. Xinfengyong sold until 6,505 yuan. The closing price at 4 o'clock was 6,515 yuan, which was 101 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price.

There was a fluctuation of 75 yuan throughout the day. The capital of the cash shop was sold at a price of 210 yuan higher than the spot red term delivery price, and the intake was 80 yuan lower than the sale. There is no price or market for the current bid gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Listed at 5 Yuan</p>

<h3 id="e44">Foreign Currency is Flat <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, although the price of spot red rose, the cash trended downward, so the British and American gold pounds, once they rose, immediately returned to flat. The British gold ticket suddenly fell by 2 yuan, and the American gold ticket revolved within a narrow range, and finally rose by 1 cent and 4 points. Hong Kong tickets tended to be firmer, and the evening market was as high as 4 yuan and 70 cents. The supply and demand of Japanese gold tickets were uniform, and the market price stabilized. The evening market was still 6 yuan and 8 points. Korean tickets followed the trend of softening, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan and 78 points.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Securities Stocks and Bonds: Bond Prices Can't Rise, Sellers Reluctant to Sell <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Over-the-counter trading of government bonds yesterday saw a downturn in market conditions. The previous day's rise had been excessively inflated, so major institutional investors on the main floor weren't interested. Buying and selling were extremely sluggish. All the agents at the meetings were effectively stalled during meeting times. Various parties thought of raising prices, but were constantly pressured by short sellers. Sellers wanted to take profits at high prices, but it was difficult to find good prices. They held each other at bay, remaining in a stalemate. Although the bulls bore very heavy interest, they could still bear the pain to maintain it. Currently, Class A bonds are the cheapest, differing from Class C bonds by only eight dollars and seven cents. However, there are still few inquiries, indicating that people are very indifferent to this. The dull situation is feared to have no hope of unfolding temporarily. Yesterday morning, Lianyi bought at market prices, initially without falling. Because Hongda settled out and Runli also sold, Class C bonds initially broke through five yuan, then broke back inside the barrier. In the afternoon, Lianyi continued to buy, and Jiufeng and Shengxing also had needs. Lianhe bought Class B and sold Class C, and Xinfeng and Hengfu also had supplies. Class C bonds once again rushed out of five yuan, but the closing price was still inside the barrier, repeatedly hovering, making it difficult to predict future changes. Market prices ultimately eased uniformly by one and a half to three cents. Only sixty to seventy thousand yuan changed hands all day. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 150 shares of Great China Match Company were traded, at a price of thirty-three yuan.</p>
<p>The trend of public enterprise stocks turned for the better, and prices rose quite a bit. The daily fluctuations were not large, and the volume was not very large. The closing sentiment was firm. Rubber stock trading was sparse.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far East central business corporations remained flat, and the market generally remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Yarn and Cotton: Shuang Ma Profit-Taking Covers Shorts, Yesterday Already Rebounded and Rose, Actual Sales Still Unchanged <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had plummeted the previous day, rebounded yesterday. This was because the sharp decline in the past two days caused profit-takers to cover their positions, tightening the main floor. General speculators specialize in the trick of kicking a man when he's down. The more it rises, the more they buy; the more it falls, the more they sell. Therefore, the ups and downs of the market often exceed the norm. However, trading in spot yarn is still lackluster. The Hong Kong merchants only bought 230 bales of red Shuang Ma brand yarn in small lots of 10-count yarn. There were no other transactions. As for Japanese 10-count yarn, it only sells for 1,200 yuan. From this point of view, Shuang Ma prices are uniquely high. The fundamental problem is that if actual sales don't rise for a long time, the foundation for the future may be difficult to consolidate. 20-count Quan Nu yarn is priced at 1,290 yuan, and Shuang Diqiu is priced at 1,265 yuan. However, general institutional investors still hold tight. The future changes are difficult to predict. 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was priced at 1,461 yuan at the high end and 1,430 yuan at the low end. Initial trading in the afternoon rose to 1,465 yuan, but then eased to 1,447 yuan due to selling activity. The final price was 1,451 yuan and 2 cents. Moreover, people who speculate in the yarn market rely solely on margin increases and decreases to gamble. In short, this is not a fundamental solution. Today, 1,470 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning, with Tanfeng tightening, because profit-takers rushed to cover. The opening price was 1,435 yuan, but some was sold off, and it soon fell back to 1,430 yuan. However, most of the main floor players were scrambling for bull positions. As a result, the market hovered around 1,436 and 1,437 yuan for a long time. Later, it was heard that gold prices were good, rising to 1,444 yuan. After nearly 11:30, the atmosphere in the market tightened because foreign exchange slightly contracted, and speculative buyers were active, rising to 1,461 yuan. Profit-takers sold off, and it fell back to 1,450 yuan. The closing price was 1,456 yuan. The half-day turnover was 12,230 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 230, Fellow Traders 12,000</p>
<p>Total 12,230</p>
<h3 id="e47">Spot Cotton Demand Not Strong <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The situation with spot cotton also feels sluggish and lacking in energy. Because factories have no way to sell their stored yarn, their interest in raw materials is very weak. As for fellow traders' thinking, they are still optimistic. However, cotton purchased by various parties in recent months has been arriving in a crowded manner, so inventory is much more abundant than before, and there is no great hope in the market. There were a total of 1,394 transactions in spot cotton, at a flat price.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 401.0 Qingsheng 240 bales, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Also 396.0 Maofeng 234 bales</p>
<p>Middling 416.0 Also 300 bales</p>
<p>Also 418.0 Also 125 bales</p>
<p>Also 418.0 Bingchang 200 bales</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 396.0 Also 300 bales</p>
<p>The New York cotton market softened due to Southern merchants buying on dips and bulls liquidating. As a result, closing prices were about 12 points lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market was also flat, and trading was even more sparse. It initially fell due to speculative selling, but then rebounded due to buying support and broker purchases. Yesterday's closing prices, except for White Low's April and May contracts, which rose 5 rupees, rose or fell by about 1 rupee each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be lower by 2 rupees.</p>
<p>Another message: Although the Shanghai foreign cotton market is gradually improving, with a slight turnaround in the market, because factories are not eating well and the international situation is swaying and uncertain, people are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and seem unwilling to purchase.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Trends Stable <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices fell yesterday, then rebounded, and the trend gradually became stable. Fellow traders engaged in hedging transactions were in the majority, while actual sales to customers remained scarce. White goods, coarse cloth, and twill rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fine cloth was flat. Dyed cloth prices also stabilized. About 300 pieces of dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and twill were traded on this street. Hong Kong merchants continued to handle 70-80 pieces of twill and coarse cloth. Wholesale business to the mainland on this street is virtually non-existent because it is currently the busy farming season. On the 14th, 1,560 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Dongbu, due to the rebound in leftover cotton yarn from the auction, short sellers covered their positions. Spot order for white goods, Longtou fine cloth, closing price in the after-market was 48 yuan and 45 cents. However, actual sales transactions were still as rare as stars at dawn. Colored goods, Four Gentlemen serge, opened in the morning at 1 yuan and 47 cents, falling to 1 yuan and 44 and a half cents. Then, because Shuang Ma yarn was reported to be rising, people were excited, and buyers suddenly emerged, gradually raising it to 1 yuan and 49 and a half cents. The closing price at noon was 1 yuan and 49 cents. Then, retail investors in the after-market began selling off again, opening at 1 yuan and 47 and a half cents. Finally, because the Exchange's yarn and cloth were slightly higher, it rose to 1 yuan and 48 cents and 75 cents at the close.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Medicinal Materials: Medicinal Fox Nut Market Strong <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Medicinal fox nuts had previously seen repeated increases due to small arrivals. Good quality white-skinned fox nuts rose to 124-125 yuan. The current market price has risen even further to 130 yuan. Red-skinned fox nuts were previously less than 100 yuan. Recently, several dozen bags have been released and reached 105 yuan. The market is strong.</p>
<h3 id="e51">North-South Goods: Large Dried Longan Sells Well <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Grade One Goods Transferred to Cold Storage</p>
<p>Large sun-dried longan, previously due to a shortage of pressing and the steadfastness of merchants, had reached over 400 yuan. As a result, there have been successive arrivals. Although the number is not large, it has already exceeded demand. Recently, sales have become quiet, and prices have gradually eased. Grade one goods have been transferred to cold storage. Market prices have fallen by 30-40 yuan before and after.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Silk and Tea: New Tea from Zhejiang Province Enters the Market <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Recently, new teas from various parts of Zhejiang Province have been successively entering the market. Red and green teas from Tangqi, Liuxia, Luoshe, and other places are mostly shipped to Hangzhou for centralized sales. Tianjin merchants are searching for Longjing, Maofeng, and other goods in large quantities. The selling price of Longjing has recently been around 1,000 yuan per dan. Maofeng also requires 570-580 yuan. As for the new goods produced and sold by foreign firms, the production volume has decreased. Because factories in Shanghai are fully stocked, and Japanese merchants are also taking a wait-and-see approach due to high prices, general tea merchants are converting to baking green tea in order to seek export through stores, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Coal: Bituminous Coal Sales Sluggish <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The bituminous coal business has seen a significant decrease in sales in recent weeks due to sluggish sales to customers and factory needs halting. High costs are also a reason. Therefore, the over-the-counter market has gradually declined. Yesterday, Kailuan bituminous coal was 420 yuan per ton, screened lumps were 430 yuan, and coal dust was 340 yuan. The above prices are all fellow traders' line splits, delivered to customers with a small commission added. Compared to the previous market, prices have fallen by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Hardware: Weishi Iron Factory Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The hardware market has been quite quiet due to the sharp rise in prices of various goods and the lack of activity from merchants from other regions. Trading has felt quite depressed, nearly for a month. Since yesterday's market, the canning factories on this street have been searching for goods, and toy factories, printing factories, and other embellishments have also been seen from time to time. Therefore, actual sales are still stirring. However, merchants from the north road remain silent, and business from the Nanyang region is also sluggish. The entire market relies solely on sales on this street. People dare not be too optimistic. Opening prices are still quite firm. For example, old steel factory goods of 200 pounds per case are selling for 395 yuan, and new steel factory goods are opening around 385 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Rubber (Continued) <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Since the invention of vulcanized rubber and hard rubber, the need for rubber has greatly increased. People from various countries have been searching for the "plant cow" that can squeeze out milk juice all over the world, forming a period of "rubber fever." However, the rubber collected from various places is of poor quality, and some are exhausted and easy to break. The supply problem in the future really needs careful study. Therefore, the British Empire, which is always thinking about commerce, naturally cannot ignore this and plan countermeasures. In 1876 AD, the British government sent the famous botanists Wickham and Narkham to Brazil to investigate. They collected the seeds of the Hevea rubber tree. After returning to the country, they were planted in the very famous Kew Botanical Gardens on the right bank of the Thames River in London. The small rubber tree seedlings grew. They used a kind of portable greenhouse to protect the less than two hundred seedlings and transported them to the island of Ceylon with great care. Ten years later, with the help of the botanical garden, Singapore was also able to supply rubber tree seedlings to planters on the Malay Peninsula. Twenty-five years later, after many technical explorations and financial sacrifices, there were already 400,000 hectares of rubber forests on the Malay Peninsula and Ceylon. Today, it has expanded to 1.3 million hectares. Many new tools and new technologies—improved from the old techniques of the Indians—have emerged one after another. The characteristics and supply capacity of rubber trees have of course also been carefully studied, unlike the previous method of "killing the chicken to get the egg." Now, rubber trees produce rubber step by step, just like dairy cows supplying milk.</p>
<p>In 1900, Brazil supplied 26,000 tons of rubber. The rubber collected from other parts of the world was also about 26,000 tons. Artificial cultivation of rubber trees on Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula only produced 4 tons. By 1920, Brazil's production was still the same. Other parts of the world have reduced by four-fifths. The British cultivated rubber forests (including the South Seas Islands) produced 500,000 tons, and only from that one Hevea rubber tree!

<h3 id="e56">New US Ambassador to China, Gauss, Arrives in Shanghai This Morning; Attended a Grand Banquet Hosted by All US Nationals in Shanghai Tonight; Will Take the Original Ship to Hong Kong and Chongqing to Assume Office; New US Military Commander in Shanghai, Howard, Arrived Together <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In order to strengthen diplomatic relations with China and provide strong support, the US authorities in Washington specially appointed Minister Gauss (pictured) to Australia to replace Dr. Johnson as the US Ambassador to China. In order to safeguard US interests in Shanghai, Colonel Howard was also selected to succeed Colonel Baker as the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. The Chinese government and the public expressed satisfaction and gratification with this measure by the US authorities, taking it as a significant attitude towards strengthening its Far East policy. They welcomed Gauss, an old friend of China, to be promoted to ambassador. Gauss has lived in China for many years, is familiar with the situation in China, and is well-known in diplomatic circles. This time, he will definitely contribute more to China and complete the tasks that China and the United States should shoulder. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai This Morning, Staying Only One Night</p>
<p>Ambassador Gauss departed from New York on March 28th on the maiden voyage of the American President Lines' world-class passenger liner President Garfield to Shanghai. The ship docked at pontoon numbers 12 and 13. The Jianghai Customs reception ship Mary Muller was scheduled to carry passengers from the ship to the dock at 9:15 this morning. Ambassador Gauss arrived at the dock on time. The US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai formed an honor guard and went to the dock to welcome him under the leadership of Colonel Baker. Gauss planned to stay in Shanghai for one night to catch up with friends. He will board the President Garfield again at 10:15 tomorrow morning and accompany the original ship via Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then go to the capital to take office. The US authorities here have arranged for him to stay at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>New Commander Arrived on the Same Ship</p>
<p>Also arriving in Shanghai on the same ship as Gauss was Colonel Howard, the new commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. Commander Howard was originally the commander of the Sixth Battalion of the US Marine Corps in San Diego. According to reports, Howard has served in the Marine Corps for 27 years. On May 11, 1914, he was ordered to leave Washington to work for the Marine Corps. In 1938, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He has served as the commander of the Marine Corps in Haiti, Santo Domingo, Washington, and other places. The US authorities in Shanghai are deeply gratified to have him. After Howard's arrival, he will take a short rest and then take office on schedule.</p>
<p>US Groups Host a Public Banquet Tonight</p>
<p>Before serving as the Australian minister, Ambassador Gauss served as the consul general in Shanghai. He had extensive contacts in Shanghai and was known for his shrewdness and ability. He has long been valued by his superiors in the US. In January 1940, Gauss was ordered by the State Council to go to Manila to meet with Admiral Hurd and Mr. Shaw, the special commissioner stationed in the Philippines, to hold a three-member summit to discuss the defense of the Philippines and review general issues in the Far East. US newspapers praised Gauss extensively. On January 19 of the same year, President Roosevelt appointed Gauss as the first minister to Australia. It has been exactly one year since he left Shanghai. The US nationals here and various public groups and friends of Gauss are overjoyed that Gauss has been appointed ambassador and returned to this place. In order to express their welcome and to reminisce about their separation, under the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce, it was decided to hold a public banquet for Mr. Gauss at the Columbia Country Club on Great West Road at 7:00 tonight. The US Consul General and envoys from various countries in Shanghai will all attend.</p>
<p>Saying Goodbye and Welcoming, Baker Leaves Shanghai</p>
<p>The news of Colonel Baker's transfer to a position in the Navy Department in Washington was issued by the US Navy Department on March 8th of this year. Since the new commander has already arrived in Shanghai and Baker himself is under military orders, he will leave Shanghai on the President Taft of the American President Lines, which is returning from Manila and Hong Kong, on the 21st of this month, taking the route of Kobe, Honolulu, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to return to the country. All officers of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will hold a grand farewell banquet at the American Club from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 20th of this month, and express their sincere welcome to the new commander, Colonel Howard. According to reports, Colonel Baker arrived in Shanghai on January 2, 1940, succeeding Colonel Fegan as the commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. Baker was born on May 29, 1894, in Briggs Field, California, USA. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1910 and became a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He was a classmate and colleague of the new commander, Colonel Howard.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Hong Kong Rice Sold Today; Tribute Rice Already Shipped; Rice Overstock in Hong Kong Urgently Expedited to Shanghai <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of 53,196 bags of low-priced Hong Kong rice handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession arrived in port on the 11th and 12th of this month, successively loaded on the Hanyang, Mingsheng, Jiangsu, and Taiyuan ships. Because it happened to be raining heavily on those two days, it was not possible to unload them, and therefore the distribution procedures had not been completed. According to the person in charge of the Liki Company, he told the reporter of the Pingming News Agency that this low-priced rice can be sold by rice stores in the next two or three days. Notification slips have now been printed to urge the grain and sundry stores and rice stores that ordered the rice to pay the money in full and deliver the goods within three days, so that they can be sold on the market. As a result, in the past few days, except for the poor people who could not wait, almost no one has inquired at the rice stores. Rice prices fell again by three or four yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai in Succession</p>
<p>According to shipping industry news, the second batch of Hong Kong rice will arrive in Shanghai within the next two days. The carriers are Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship and Taikoo's Guangdong ship. As for the date of sale, according to Liki Company's manager Kneeschelle, it will be before the weekend, probably in the next one or two days. It is also heard that Liki Company has continued to order 250,000 bags from Hong Kong in preparation for shipping to Shanghai and selling them next month.</p>
<p>Starting Today, Going to Pick Up the Goods</p>
<p>Liki Company and Xiangmao Company, which are selling the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice, have been working very hard these days. According to reports, Liki Company is responsible for handling the ordering and picking up of goods, while Xiangmao Company is the payment place for those who ordered the rice. Liki Company has now completed the customs declaration and warehousing procedures for the first batch of Hong Kong rice shipped to Shanghai. It is heard that rice stores will start to pick up the goods from the two foreign companies today in preparation for sale. It is also learned that in order to promote the rapid purchase of this Hong Kong rice by rice stores in the concession area for sale on the market, the two concession authorities allow rice stores with relatively weak capital to gather several stores together to jointly order from Liki Company.</p>
<p>Payment and Delivery Based on Conditions</p>
<p>(1) Payment: Pay in full within three days, exchanging cash for warehouse receipts. (2) Delivery Period: Deliver the goods within ten days from the date of sale, otherwise the warehouse rent will be borne by the seller. (3) Weight: If the goods are not taken out within ten days from the date of sale, the goods will no longer be weighed, and the weight on the ship's bill of lading will be used as the weight at the time of delivery, and the buyer will receive it. (4) Insurance: From the date of sale, all risks of storing the goods will be borne by the buyer. Fire insurance is only valid for ten days from this date. (5) Other conditions: The buyer promises to strictly abide by the conditions of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession that he signed. In the future, when retailing, he promises that each bag or more of rice sold will be accompanied by an invoice stating the name and address of the buyer and seller, and a duplicate should be added for the police to inspect at any time when they come to the store. In addition, retailers must not supply each household with more rice than is needed by the family each month, and must not sell it except for Shanghai households.</p>
<p>Beware of Rice Weevils and Passing Off Inferior Goods as Superior</p>
<p>After receiving the payment notification slip from Liki Company, each miscellaneous grain store and rice store can pay the money at Xiangmao Company at 20 Guangdong Road within three days, and within ten days can bring the bill of lading to the warehouse noted on the bill to pick up the goods. As for the weighing procedures, the Shanghai Municipal Council has entrusted them to the two foreign companies: Pauling &amp; Company at 2 Beijing Road and San Yi Company at 12 The Bund. Also, yesterday, there were widespread rumors in the two concessions that the Shanghai Municipal Council's low-priced Hong Kong rice had already been sold by various rice stores, which was not true. However, according to the reporter's investigation, a small number of rice stores were found in the French Concession that put up a sign saying "Low-Priced Rice" on their rice, priced at 110 yuan, and the rice was mostly mixed with scraps and was very different in quality from the 40-grain small rice from Yangon. When asked about it, they replied that this was the low-priced rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which was no different from the Hong Kong rice handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and advised the reporter to buy it. This kind of passing off inferior goods as superior has constituted a crime of fraud, which not only damages the reputation of low-priced rice, but also harms the interests of citizens. It is hoped that the concession authorities will thoroughly investigate and punish the offenders in order to deter the wicked.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Low-Priced Rice to Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the French Concession, the authorities also directly ordered 200,000 bags of tribute rice from the Vietnamese authorities some time ago in order to stabilize food for the people and suppress rice prices. The first batch of 50,000 bags has been loaded on the (1) Varenne ship, managed by the Hualun Company, with 30,000 bags. The ship is currently on its way to Shanghai via Yangon. (2) The Sarraut ship with 20,000 bags is expected to arrive on the 20th of this month. As for the remaining 150,000 bags, they will all arrive here by the end of this month at the latest. At that time, all legal rice stores in the French Concession will be able to enjoy the right to sell low-priced rice. As for its selling price, because the grain handled by the authorities is Saigon rice, the quality is guaranteed. The international exchange rate will be determined temporarily at that time. However, various procedures are the same as those of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Overstocking Rice</p>
<p>Also, according to people from Hong Kong, in order to meet the needs, the Hong Kong government has long ordered a large amount of foreign rice from Vietnam, Siam, Myanmar, and other foreign rice producing areas, so the foreign rice shipped to Hong Kong has been surging in recent days, and the warehouses have been piled high. Therefore, the ships carrying Hong Kong rice to Shanghai this time must sail to Hong Kong to carry rice to Shanghai as soon as they finish unloading. Before the Hong Kong government implemented rice control, some rice merchants with greater power had asked the Hong Kong government to allow government-business cooperation, but this was rejected by the Hong Kong government, because the Hong Kong government was aware that the limited prices set each time had been undermined by unscrupulous merchants exceeding the limited prices, so it made this decision.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Old Zhabei Police Inspector Yu Fugeng Ambushed: Seriously Wounded and in Critical Condition; Street Vendor Killed by Stray Bullet; Detectives and Rickshaw Driver Injured <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yu Fugeng, Inspector of the Old Zhabei Police Department of the Public Concession, was ambushed yesterday afternoon at approximately 5:00 PM while passing the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road on official duty. Two thugs suddenly emerged and fired more than ten shots from a new type of box-shaped pistol. Yu was hit in the forehead while in his rickshaw and collapsed on the spot, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. Four other people were injured or killed by stray bullets. The thugs then fled with their weapons, disappearing without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Traveling by Chartered Rickshaw</p>
<p>Yu Fugeng, the Chinese Inspector of the Old Zhabei Police Department, is 55 years old and a native of Funing. He is known for being shrewd and capable, as well as kind and approachable, which has earned him the deep respect of his superiors. He resides at No. 2, Lane 1256, 11256 Avenue Edward VII. Yesterday, at approximately 5:15 PM, Yu left the Old Zhabei Police Department after finishing his duties and boarded a chartered rickshaw that he provided. Four detectives followed closely behind in a tram for protection.</p>
<p>Shot in the Forehead, Skull Shattered</p>
<p>As the rickshaw passed Nanjing Road and reached No. 294 Yunnan Road, in front of the clinic of Dr. Shen Huimin, two thugs in Western suits suddenly emerged. They had been lying in wait at the entrance of Lane 287 next door. Seeing Yu's rickshaw approaching, they immediately drew their new type of box-shaped pistols and fired more than ten shots without asking any questions. The bullets rained down like a string of pearls. One bullet struck Yu in the right forehead, piercing through to the left forehead, shattering his skull. He cried out "Ah!" and collapsed to the ground. He was also hit by a bullet in the waist.</p>
<p>Detective Injured, Book Vendor Killed</p>
<p>As the bullets flew, Yu's rickshaw puller, named Bai Shang (46 years old, from Tongzhou), was shot in both legs and also collapsed. Detective Shan Zhaoxian, 30 years old, from Tianjin, who was sitting in the tram behind, was also hit in both hands by stray bullets. Rickshaw puller Liu Dacheng, 30 years old, was injured in the right leg. Most tragically, a man named Wang Keming (42 years old, from Shaoxing), who had a small book stall next to the Yangtze Hotel's back door, was hit in the head and chest by two stray bullets and died instantly.</p>
<p>Large Car Riddled with Bullet Holes</p>
<p>At the time of the shooting, a large Yangtze Hotel passenger car, license plate number 15867, was parked on the side of the road. The car body was also hit, riddled with bullet holes, numbering six or seven. The surrounding glass was shattered. The Yangtze Hotel wall along the road also had multiple holes. Upon hearing the multiple gunshots, pedestrians and shopkeepers in the vicinity all scurried for cover. After firing, the thugs, seeing their objective achieved, fled with their weapons, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Police Alert, Hunt for Culprits Unsuccessful</p>
<p>After being wounded, Yu collapsed in a pool of blood. Other detectives immediately helped him up and reported the incident to the Old Zhabei Police Department. Several red police vehicles were quickly dispatched to the scene. Traffic was blocked on Yunnan Road around Juekou Road. A strict search for the gunmen was initiated. After half an hour, the alert was lifted and traffic resumed. It is reported that the culprits were not apprehended.</p>
<p>Seriously Injured, Life in Danger</p>
<p>An ambulance was urgently called to the scene and transported the injured and the body to Renji Hospital. A surgeon performed an operation on Yu, but the injury to his head, with his skull shattered, was too severe. He is in critical condition and his life is in danger. The other injured are not seriously hurt. It was later learned that Yu had a club located at No. 8, B Yu, Hami Road, directly across from the Yangtze Hotel, where Yu would often take a break. His son, named Guoliang, previously studied at Jiaotong University and was just married at the Hu She on the 1st of this month.</p>

<p>Departing for Hong Kong Tomorrow at Noon</p>
<p>The fourth new liner of the American President Lines' World Class, the S.S. President Garfield, has arrived from the East on its maiden voyage. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning at 7:30 AM, berthing at Buoy 12/13. Passengers will transfer to a company-provided launch to disembark at the Customs Wharf at precisely 1:00 PM. The liner is scheduled to set sail on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, Xiaoluson, Singapore, and other Southeast Asian ports, then to Mumbai, around the Cape of Good Hope, and back to Boston to complete its circumnavigation. The ship's tonnage, design, and interior amenities are identical to those of the new ships like the Jackson, Monroe, and Hays. Due to these extraordinary times, public tours have been cancelled. The maiden voyage carries 74 passengers, 28 of whom will disembark in Shanghai. The remaining 46 will continue on the original ship for their Southeast Asian and around-the-world voyages. It brings 352 bags of mail. The number of Shanghai residents travelling to Southeast Asia on this ship has not yet been announced. The company's passenger launch is scheduled to depart from the Customs Wharf at precisely 10:15 AM tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the American merchant ship S.S. Estelle L. Da Xin, carrying a large quantity of cotton from Huanglin Port at the mouth of the Yangtze River to Shanghai, and docked in front of Buoy No. 5 on the Bund, was detained again today (the 13th) by the Japanese authorities. This is the third time the ship has been detained in recent months. It is reported that the shipowner has begun negotiations with the Japanese authorities in order to release the ship this afternoon. At the same time, the American Consulate General has received notification regarding this matter. This afternoon, the ship remained tied to Buoy No. 5, with a Japanese military launch berthed alongside. The holds and foredeck were piled high with cotton. The Chinese crew members were unsurprised by the detention and said they expected to be released this afternoon. Japanese officials said that the S.S. Estelle L. was being detained because it was carrying contraband cotton. However, they made no statement regarding when the ship would be released or whether the cotton would be confiscated. It is noted that the ship was first detained for two weeks last summer at Wusongkou. In November, it was again detained along with twelve other foreign merchant ships for attempting to pass the Japanese blockade line off the coast of Zhejiang. It was not released until late February after negotiations between the American authorities and the Japanese side.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Rockefeller Foundation Spent Over US$9 Million Last Year: Most Used for Public Health <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The 1940 Rockefeller Foundation report has arrived in Shanghai. According to Foundation Chairman Fosdick, the Foundation had an income of $9,854,497 USD last year, of which $7,605,342.81 was from investments. In addition, $1,150,000 was withdrawn from the Foundation’s funds.</p>
<p>Use</p>
<p>The funds were used for six categories: (1) public health, $2,750,000; (2) natural sciences, $2,200,000; (3) social sciences, $1,500,000; (4) medicine, $1,300,000; (5) charitable work, $1,075,000; (6) rural construction in China, $200,000. Seventy percent of last year's expenditures were in the United States. Although hindered by the war, the Foundation was still able to use funds in 44 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas for construction and relief expenses. Therefore, the Foundation committee's</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>was actually the most difficult year compared to the past. After the First World War, the School of Hygiene in Warsaw, the School of Public Health in Prague, the William Academy in Berlin, the Institute of Mental Therapy in Munich, and the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry in Gottingen received funds from the Foundation. However, due to the war, the individuals and groups that received grants could not continue to engage in research, as they were either imprisoned in concentration camps or had fled, and their research institutes were destroyed. The Foundation expressed its enthusiasm and respect for the scholars from various countries who suffered losses due to the war. The report continued that the Foundation's</p>
<p>Assistance</p>
<p>to major countries had two important targets. One was the construction of a 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar in California, which was estimated to be worth $6 million in 1926. The International Education Association designed this project and it is nearly complete. The other was funding the University of California to build a cyclotron, which was designed by Professor Loren Qi of the school to examine the structure of atoms. This experiment will be of great assistance to chemistry, biochemistry, cardiology, and other sciences. It is clear that the above work is very important.</p>

<p>At the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road in West Shanghai, the Public Concession Police Department had erected barbed wire fences to create two narrow lanes for vehicles to pass through, facilitating inspections. These facilities still exist today, and because the area is an American military defense zone, several American soldiers are also stationed there.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 1:40 PM, a black streamlined car, license plate number 460, carrying three men and one woman, passed through the entrance. The Western police officers stationed there stopped the car and approached to search it. It is unclear how, but a misunderstanding led to a shootout. Both sides fired dozens of shots.</p>
<p>Western Police Officer Shot, Car Passengers Injured</p>
<p>At the time, nearby shops and pedestrians, unaware of the truth, hurriedly closed their doors and fled, causing great disorder. As a result, a Western police officer, Badge No. 52, was shot and injured in the jaw. At the same time, two men in Western suits and the driver in the car, who were armed, were all shot and wounded, collapsing inside the car. However, the man and woman sitting in the back of the car were unharmed.</p>
<p>Police and American Military on High Alert</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Police Station, located nearby, immediately dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to surround the car and transport the wounded to the Public Hospital for treatment. The American military camp, upon receiving the news, also sent American soldiers to guard the scene. It was later learned that two rickshaw pullers were also injured by stray bullets. It was also reported that the car owner was named Wu Yunfu, who was in the car with his wife at the time. The two Western-suited men who were injured were bodyguards.</p>

<p>Wang Xiarong, a 22-year-old local dancer with a beautiful appearance, works at the Xinhua Dance Hall next to the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Avenue Edward VII. She lives at No. 13, Lane 314, Baker Road. Because of Wang's attractive appearance, her nightly earnings as a dance partner are always the highest among the dance hall's dancers. This aroused the envy of Chen Xiaofuzi, the dance hall's floor manager (the leader in charge of the dancers), who is from Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Attempts Seduction</p>
<p>Because Wang refused to be complacent, Chen had no opportunity. On the 11th at 11:00 PM, Chen entered the hall and invited Wang to dance. Wang, due to professional obligations, felt she could not refuse and reluctantly agreed. She embraced Chen and stepped onto the dance floor. As they danced, Chen had evil thoughts and began to grope Wang's body. Wang stopped dancing and rebuked Chen, saying that as a floor manager, he should not violate his duties by engaging in</p>
<p>Improper Conduct</p>
<p>Chen became enraged and resorted to violence, grabbing Wang and punching her, and kicking her with his leather shoes, causing Wang to be injured. The dance hall manager intervened and persuaded Chen to stop. Wang returned home, enduring the shame and pain. The next day, she was unable to get out of bed due to her injuries. Her mother, after learning what had happened, took Wang to Baolong Hospital for treatment. After examining Wang, the doctor confirmed that her</p>
<p>Injuries Were Severe</p>
<p>and after learning that they were caused by a beating, reported the incident to the police according to regulations. The investigation revealed that the incident occurred in the French Concession, so the French police were notified. After detectives went to the hospital to investigate, they attempted to arrest Chen Xiaofuzi, the perpetrator. However, he had already fled home upon hearing the news. The police are now dispatching detectives to apprehend him and have strictly ordered the Siwa Dance Hall to hand Chen over. Wang Xiarong's injuries will require a long period of medical treatment to fully recover.</p>

<p>Taoism: Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, Chapter 10, states, "Carrying the soul and embracing the One, can you keep them from separation?" Wang Bi's commentary states, "To reside, to dwell. The soul is the constant dwelling place of man. The One is the true essence of man. This means that man can dwell in his constant dwelling place, embracing the One in purity of spirit, and never be separated from it?" Chapter 22: "The Sage embraces the One and becomes the model of the world." Chapter 39: "Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear; earth obtains the One and becomes tranquil; the spirit obtains the One and becomes divine; the valley obtains the One and becomes full; all things obtain the One and come into being; the ruler obtains the One and becomes the foundation of the world." Chapter 42: "Tao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three, Three begets all things." Zhuangzi's Nanhua Jing, Qi Wu Lun Chapter, states, "The Tao, when comprehended, becomes One." It also states, "All things have no creation or destruction, and ultimately return to One. Only the enlightened know that all things return to One." It also states, "Heaven and earth were born together with me, and all things are one with me." The De Chong Fu Chapter quotes Confucius as saying, "From the perspective of their sameness, all things are one." The Da Zong Shi Chapter states, "Its One is One, its not One is One." It also states, "To arrange and then go with the transformation is to enter into the desolate One of Heaven." Guo Xiang's commentary on Xiang Xiu states, "To be at peace with the shifts and changes and to go together with the transformations, is to enter into the desolation and become one with Heaven." The Tian Xia Chapter states, "The Sage has that from which he is born, and the Lord has that by which he is made complete, all originating from the One." It also states, "Rule with the Great One." It also states, "Love all things widely, Heaven and earth are one body." This is confirmed by the five universal paths in the Li Ji, Zhong Yong Chapter, which are the relations between ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brother, and friend and friend. The three universal virtues are benevolence, wisdom, and courage, which are practiced with One. One is born knowing, one learns knowing, one is troubled knowing, and one achieves knowing of the One. One is at peace acting, one is profited acting, one struggles acting, and one achieves success. Although Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi discuss both Heaven, Earth and all things, while Confucius focuses solely on human affairs, they are largely in agreement.</p>
<p>Christianity: The various Gospels of the New Testament, the various accounts in the Acts of the Apostles, and the God of Revelation.</p>
<p>Islam: The Truthful Master, translated as the Supreme Being, in the various chapters of the Koran, is absolutely supreme and to be followed without question. This aligns with the Analects, Ba Yi Chapter, "He who offends against Heaven has nowhere to pray to." Zi Han Chapter, "Who do I deceive? Do I deceive Heaven?" Ji Shi Chapter, "Have reverence for the Decree of Heaven," are also in agreement. Thus, the teachings of Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, when discussed in terms of time, have a sequence, and when discussed in terms of place, are divided between China and the rest of the world, but they are all within the scope of my way which is threaded with One.</p>
<p>When we read the books of Confucius, it is not merely reading the paintings of the Five Religions. Recently, I have heard that Western scholars are increasingly studying Confucius. Will the Way of Confucius be practiced globally? In the past, Confucius gathered the great achievements of the many sages. Today, the Five Religions coexist without conflict, and the Way of Confucius gathers the great achievements of the Five Religions. This is precisely the great wish of "teaching without discrimination" in the Analects, Wei Ling Gong Chapter. How can we limit ourselves to Confucianism? I know that the Analects, Yan Yuan Chapter, tells Zhonggong, "What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others. Thus, there will be no resentment against you in the state, and there will be no resentment against you in the family." Wei Ling Gong Chapter tells Zizhang, "Let loyalty and sincerity be everything, and let every action be marked with conscientiousness and respect." In even the lands of the barbarians, it will be put into practice. Its effectiveness is assured. Therefore, I offer this prayer: I pray to the Great Accomplishment, the Most Sage Teacher Confucius, to harmonize the Five Religions, to save all lands, to elevate the world to the Great Harmony, and to witness the ultimate bliss of the people's livelihood. After the speech, Mr. Yang Zhongyi elaborated on the theory, citing extensively. He had not finished his speech, and it will be continued in the next session.</p>

<h3 id="e68">American International Assurance Company: 20th Annual Shareholders' Meeting; General Manager Fei Mengfu Presents Report; Last Year's Profit Over US$70,000 <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The American International Assurance Company held its 20th Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Mr. Fei Mengfu, the company's General Manager, presented a report on the company's business conditions last year. The report is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Business Progress</p>
<p>At the 20th Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the American International Assurance Company, the Board of Directors authorized me to report on the company's business conditions last year. The company's business last year achieved a profit of US$75,963.62. After deducting US$39,791.09 for policyholder dividends, the net profit was US$36,172.503, which did not include profits from investments and exchange rates. This net profit was added to US$154,484.15 (the amount of surplus at the end of the previous year). In addition, there were investment profits of US$22,067, policyholder dividends that were cancelled and unclaimed of US$1,674.30, and profits from exchange rates and revaluation of investments of US$48,540.95, totaling US$108,454.76. Shareholder dividends paid out last year totaled 20,000 yuan. Managerial debt also increased to US$6,360.44. These are all items that should be deducted from the surplus. At the same time, the Board of Directors believes that another US$30,000 should be deducted from the surplus in order to increase the investment and exchange rate reserve to a total of US$60,000. The total amount deducted from the surplus reached US$56,360.44, resulting in a net surplus of US$206,578.49. Compared to the previous system in the United States, the company's life insurance reserve, which has already been established, currently reaches US$2,513,021.81. The company's total assets reach US$3,240,077.12, an increase of US$434,163,163.29 from December 31st of the previous year.</p>
<p>Sufficient Preparation</p>
<p>The company's investment allocation is extremely sound. The cash reserve is very large. This is not used to fulfill any debt obligations, but in the current world situation, strengthening liquid assets is extremely necessary. Although our cash reserve is extremely large, the income from interest, dividends, and rent still reaches US$98,558.18, or at least 3.56% of the company's assets, which is sufficient to maintain the interest required for the policy reserve.</p>
<p>Low Mortality Rate</p>
<p>In 1940, the mortality rate of the company's policyholders was extremely low, only reaching 42.5% of the expected rate. In 1939, the mortality rate reached 53.03% of the expected rate, which we already considered satisfactory. This special record is partly due to the surge in new policyholders in the past few years and at the same time proves that the war in the Far East has not had a significant impact on the mortality rate of the company's policyholders.</p>
<p>Increased Coverage</p>
<p>The important achievement of a life insurance company should be measured by the increase in effective insurance coverage. Based on this point, the company's performance last year was extremely impressive. New insurance coverage increased by 50% compared to the previous year. As a result, after deducting all invalid policies and paid claims, the company's effective insurance coverage increased by US$3,627,290.</p>
<p>Philippine Business</p>
<p>As of December 31st of last year, the company's total effective insurance coverage reached US$19,932,031, of which 50% was insured by the people of the Philippines, 16% was insured by the people of Hong Kong, and the remainder was spread throughout the company's business areas. As far as China is concerned, the total effective insurance coverage, calculated in US dollars, has been sharply reduced, accounting for less than 12% of the total. This is due to the devaluation of the Chinese legal tender. However, if calculated in the local currency, the figure would be a new record in the company's history. The development of business in the Philippines in the past few years has prompted the company to send important personnel to be stationed there permanently. In 1940, the Board of Directors decided to establish a head office in Xiaoluson to enhance the effectiveness of serving policyholders. It has already been established last year, managed by two company personnel. All business operations, such as policy issuance and claims, are fully handled by the two representatives of the branch office, without the need to transfer to the Shanghai office for decisions. As a result, the efficiency of the office has greatly increased.</p>
<p>Moving Forward</p>
<p>In 1940, as the war in China continued and the European war spread, the lives of residents in all areas within the company's business scope in the Far East were greatly affected. However, business continued to flourish, which can be regarded as a successful year for American International. The company's assets and surplus funds have both increased sharply. Although we are unable to make accurate predictions for the coming year, the Board of Directors believes that our company's preparations are sufficient to cope with any new situation. This is because the service spirit of our company's business personnel has never been criticized due to special circumstances. At the same time, the staff of the Philippine and Shanghai head offices are also loyal to their duties and moving forward.</p>

<p>Morphine King Li Hongsheng has been operating a drug business and making a considerable profit. He has now secretly established his own facility, purchased machinery and opium, refined morphine, and secretly set up distribution agencies within the British and French Concessions for sales. This has now been discovered by the French police. Li secretly set up a drug distribution agency in Bu Yaoting's home on the upper floor of No. 60 Zhengjia Muqiao Street. Detectives Gao Meihui and Wang Dongwan, and officers Cao Chuanbiao and Zhou Jingyuan, rushed to search the premises at 11:00 AM on the day before yesterday. Bu Yaoting (46 years old, from Taixing) was arrested, and a large bag of morphine, weighing sixteen taels (one catty), cash of eight thousand one hundred yuan earned from selling drugs, and other miscellaneous items such as scales, sieves, and wrapping paper were confiscated. He was taken back to the police station for detailed investigation and handling. The police chief issued an order to strictly apprehend the main culprit Li Hongsheng, who is on the run, and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>"Speaking of this matter, you are also partly to blame! Of course, I'm not saying you and Miss should not have developed this relationship, because she was forcibly deceived by my uncle, and there was no emotion between them at all, not even a proper status. It's very justifiable for her to love you and for you to love her. Besides, your behavior is always very pure. Even if you weren't my good friend, I would sympathize with you. However, old brother, can I ask you a question now? Please tell me: have I been treating you with all my heart as a friend these past few years? If so, then please tell me, why didn't you give me a slight hint beforehand...?"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang's right eye, filled with tears, gradually opened.</p>
<p>"If I had understood a little earlier, today's events wouldn't have become such a mess!" Yuan Shaowen said powerfully, with a look of great regret on his face.</p>
<p>Remorse surged from Qiu Haitang's own heart, but he still didn't know what to say to Shaowen.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, regarding today's events, I wasn't just standing by. I was so anxious that I lost my composure, and all I wanted to do was to bring Lao Hu over to help you plead for leniency. Unexpectedly, we were a step too late, and instead ruined you! I could have had a falling out with him - and in fact, we almost did! But thinking about it carefully, he's still human, and of course he's going to be angry. If such a thing happened to you or me, we probably wouldn't be without anger either? Besides, this bad idea wasn't even his. Old brother, you have to remember that I'm still his junior, and with Lao Hu doing his best to persuade him from the side, in this situation, what else could I do except rush you to the hospital for treatment?"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang still felt like he had nothing good to say.</p>
<p>"Now, I'm the one who sent you to the hospital," Shaowen said, raising a finger and pointing it at himself several times. "If you stubbornly insist on your own way, refusing to take medicine, refusing to let them treat you, then you're deliberately making things difficult for me!..." (105)</p>

<p>Although rice prices are soaring, the meat shops are no less crowded than in the old days, showing that there are indeed many wealthy people on this isolated island. After all, one must first pay for rice before going to the meat shop!</p>
<p>Near Zhejiang Road, there is a "Lu Gao Jian" meat shop, and business is really too good. Customers fill the shop every day, and those who arrive later are bound to be disappointed. The shop owner, being unable to handle the crowd and also to reward customers, has started selling "meat tickets" from the day before yesterday. Those who hold meat tickets can collect their meat the next morning, thus avoiding the worry of "sold out."</p>
<p>Rice prices have exceeded 140 or 150 yuan, and the poor are wandering in a "land of hunger" every day. They probably haven't tasted meat in three years. But the rich will feel uncomfortable if they don't have meat for a day. Meat is rich in fat! No wonder they are all getting fat and bloated. If I were a meat shop owner, I would definitely raise the meat price sharply, because with the loyal customers, there would absolutely be no problem with business. They see meat as their third life, second only to rice.</p>

<p>— Zhong Zimang</p>
<p>A "philanthropist" gives a beggar one cent, and the beggar cries bitterly, "Sir, one cent isn't even enough for a big pancake!" But how would the "sir" know the market price of pancakes? Opening one's purse is already a "generous act" - although one cent is just the smallest "atom" in the "sir's" wealth, it sometimes occupies an important position in the "sir's" mind.</p>
<p>Now, let's say the "sir" walks into a department store - the "sir" wants to buy a glass cup.</p>
<p>So he finds the glassware department. As usual, this "sir," although wealthy, knows the "difficulty" of earning money. He has spent a lot of effort, although he's willing to let his son secretly take bits and pieces for a life of wine and extravagance! He himself might as well suffer a little, so he always puts "economy" first. Of course, even when buying a glass, he has to choose a cheap one.</p>
<p>He asks the clerk to show him Sichuan products. The clerk takes out a light blue cup.</p>
<p>The "sir" takes it in his hand, looks at it, and asks the clerk how much it costs.</p>
<p>The clerk replies that he has to pay one yuan.</p>
<p>The "sir" is not happy. He thinks: another yuan, once you break a ten-yuan bill, you only have nine left. How can I afford that? The "sir" doesn't have the hesitation of a young man. He claims: the quality is too poor, it's not strong enough, and it's probably going to explode when filled with hot water. After stating his reasons, the "sir" decides to go to the second store.</p>
<p>The "sir" arrives at another department store. Without even looking for the glassware department, there are piles and piles of glasses. The "sir" inquires about the price: "Nine jiao and seven fen." The "sir" taps the glass. The "sir" is very satisfied. The "sir" says to himself: only nine jiao and seven fen, much cheaper. When you break a ten, you still have more than nine left, cheap, cheap. The "sir" doesn't even want to "shop around," he buys it.</p>
<p>Then the "sir" suddenly thinks about getting a haircut, but he still has to pick and choose.</p>
<p>The "sir" walks into a "nine jiao and nine" barbershop. The "sir" is satisfied and presses his butt down on the spring. The "sir" gets a haircut.</p>
<p>When the "sir" pays, the "sir" takes out a legal tender and asks the barber to give him change.</p>
<p>The barber smiles contemptuously and hands over one cent, as if giving it to a beggar.</p>
<p>The "sir" walks on the road, a beggar stretches out a hand: "Sir, I'm starving to death, starving to death... Sir."</p>
<p>The "sir" throws the remaining one cent to the beggar. The "sir" has completed the style of a "philanthropist."</p>
<p>The barber and his colleagues are talking about the "sir's" stinginess and their "miscalculation." But if they added the "nine jiao and nine fen" and "one fen," they wouldn't have gotten the business.</p>

<p>— Xiao Peng</p>
<p>Among the many modern playwrights, Xia Yan is the one who leaves an indelible impression on people. Playwrights who advocate art for art's sake only know how to focus on form and don't care about the impact of the play's performance on society. Some playwrights understand the mission of drama, but because they lack cultivation, they can't make the script figurative and fall into the form of a disguised lecture. The advantage of Xia Yan's plays is that they not only consider social value, but also have true artistic value. The production of "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" and "A Year's Leisure" is the practice of his correct drama theory. The uniqueness of his works is the reality of the content and the simplicity of the form - Chinese, popular, and "well-liked and easily understood" by the petty bourgeoisie. He accepts the advantages of Western drama, but he doesn't allow his works to become completely Westernized. He accepts the tradition of Chinese old opera, but his works are not a reproduction of old opera. The depth of character portrayal and the refinement and conciseness of the form are consistently preserved in his works.</p>
<p>In the past—and it can be said now—the theater world has asked playwrights to "represent Shanghai." Obviously, Xia Yan has put the most effort into "representing Shanghai." "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" and "A Corner of the Metropolis" are powerful works of "representing Shanghai." "A Chronicle of Sorrow" is his new work that "represents" "Shanghai" after August 13th. Of course, I only saw a portion of it introduced in the "Small Theater" magazine, but I feel that "A Chronicle of Sorrow" is still as fresh and lovely as his past works, and surpasses other dramas that "represent Shanghai."</p>
<p>The content of "A Chronicle of Sorrow" targets the current phenomenon of speculation in Shanghai and points out the tragedy of the fall of speculators. The performance of such a realistic work can undoubtedly play a positive role. If the performance of a play must pay attention to the effect of "this time and this place," then "A Chronicle of Sorrow" can serve as a model for Shanghai's theatrical movement. At the same time, any scripts that are harmful to "this time and this place," even if famous actors can be used as a selling point, should be strictly rejected.</p>
<p>"A Chronicle of Sorrow" and "Striving for Strength" were successively adopted by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society as plays to be staged. However, the performance effects of the two plays in "this time and this place" are completely different. The former is beneficial to "Shanghai," while the latter is of no benefit to "Shanghai." I hope to stage more plays like "A Chronicle of Sorrow" and fewer plays like "Striving for Strength." I hope to stage more plays that "represent Shanghai" and pay attention to the effects of "this time and this place." This important task should be shouldered by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society, which has always had a serious attitude, and by progressive theater workers.</p>
<h3 id="e79">A Record of Listening to Kunqu Opera in the Rain <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Mei</p>
<p>The Xianni Society is the only Kunqu troupe in the South, just like the Shengqing Society in the North. However, the Shengqing Society is formed by gathering old performers, while Xianni is purely composed of students from the New Music Academy. The Xianni Society was most popular during its performances at the Small World and the Great World. Later, when the young male actor Gu Chuanjie abandoned his career and the old male actor Shi Chuanzhen died of illness, and since the outbreak of the war, members either fled to other places or changed careers. Chuanqian, Fang Chuanyun, Zheng Chuanjian, Wang Chuansong, Hua Chuanhao, Zhou Chuanying, Zhang Chuanfang, Shao Chuanjun, etc., ran through various waterways and troupes, but still could not make a living. Fearing that they would be stranded in other places, they returned to Shanghai together, united as one, and worked together to reorganize the Xianni Society. They performed at the Daxin Company Amusement Park, and the audience was extremely large at that time. Later, they went to the Oriental Bookstore, but soon the members became distracted, and Xianni dispersed again. Suddenly, several years have passed.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Zheng Chuanjian, Zhu Chuanming, Zhou Chuanying, Wang Fuqian, etc., after rehearsing Kunqu opera, formed a small troupe at the Oriental Bookstore, performing Kunqu opera for two hours every Saturday and Sunday starting at 5:15. From then on, Xianni's beautiful songs could be heard again, although the talents were uneven, it was better than nothing.</p>
<p>Last Saturday's program included "The Jade Hairpin" ("Flirting with the Zither"), "Selling Horses" ("Crying at the Prison," "Writing the Accusation," "Three Pulls," "Reunion"). I went to listen in the rain. When I entered, Zhou Chuanying and Zhang Chuanfang's "Flirting with the Zither" had already started. Chuanying's male character, since Gu Chuanjie abandoned his career, has been solely responsible. In the past five or six years, his artistic skills have improved rapidly. I once watched his "Broken Bridge" scene, and his stage steps and body movements were so elegant, and the beauty of his sleeve movements was so wonderful, that even Chuanjie and Zhenfei would have to sigh that they were inferior. "Flirting with the Zither" is one of his masterpieces, depicting Pan Bizheng, expressing flirtatiousness in gentleness, revealing romance in conversation, without losing the nature of a scholar. Zhang Chuanfang's Chen Miaochang is also meticulous, and her lines are very pleasant to listen to. I have seen Cheng Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei perform this, and Yanqiu's Chen Miaochang is bashful and angry, with a sense of proportion in everything, which Zhang Chuanfang does not reach. Zhenfei's Pan Bizheng is good in every way, but unfortunately too vulgar, not like a gentle and refined scholar, because "flirting" is mistaken for "hanging." "Selling Horses" was performed by Zheng Chuanyun, Zhu Chuanming, Shao Chuanjun, Zhou Chuanying, and Wang Chuansong. Because Wang Chuansong did not come, Zheng Chuanjian's Li Qi, Wu Zixu in "Sending the Son," and Li Guinian in "Playing Words" are all considered masterpieces. His tone and expression are enough to rival Wei Qinglin in the North, and cannot be compared to Zhang Chunyan, Li Baokui, or Guan Shengxi in Peking Opera. Zhu Chuanming's Li Guizhi's melody and lines, are both refined, elegant, gentle, and charming, showing her acting skills to the fullest, and she can be called a master of portraying emotions, rivaling Cheng Yanqiu in Peking Opera (Yanqiu's Kunqu opera was mostly taught by Chuanming). Shao Chuanjun's Zhao Chong is less dashing than Yu Zhenfei, but his voice is broader and brighter than Yu's, and both his singing and lines are commendable. "Breaking into the Camp" felt less compact due to the absence of Wang Chuansong's Old Master Hu. Zhou Chuanying's Li Tai is not his forte, but he is still stable. In Kunqu opera, the god of the water monster wears a mask and sings in the net role voice, which is slightly different from Peking Opera, which uses a shaved old man to play the character with a bare face and black lines painted around the nose and eyes. Liu Qiong and Zhang Wan in "Broken Heart Flower" (originally titled "The Soul Returns to the Land of Regret") are the first work of Yuan Meiyun and her husband, self-funded.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's New Work</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang has been busy filming "Home" and "Wild Roses." In "Wild Roses," Chen Yunshang plays a naive and wild girl, so there are various shots of nudity. The United Nations authorities have specifically declined visits.</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun Gives Birth</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun, with a large belly, gave birth to a son the night before last (the 12th). Because the fetus was too large, she had a difficult labor. Dr. Qu Shaohang and his wife performed the operation, and she gave birth safely. Mother and child are both safe after delivery.</p>

<p>The Russian Art Theatre on Foch Road will present a three-act satirical comedy, "Before Leaving," written by playwright Jiang Liu, at 3:00 p.m. (new time) and 8:00 p.m. tomorrow. This spring, the company once performed famous plays such as "Survival and Death," achieving great success. In the past two months, the company's organization has been strengthened and completely renewed. This kind of social drama that grasps reality is indeed worth watching. (2) The Jiliu Drama Society's tenth performance of "Peacock Flies Southeast," directed by Ma Ling, with actors Lu Yukun, Ma Ji, Ma Xiaonong, Min Qiu, Wang Di, Hong Wei, etc., is scheduled to be performed at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association on May 23. Tickets are already on sale at Minsheng Middle School, No. 424 Beijing Road, Central Racket Factory, Xiafei Road, and Chinese Fifth Vocational School, Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road.</p>

<p>(4) Cheng Yanqiu</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu is also known as one of the great Dan performers, because his singing style is uniquely creative. The high notes soar into the clouds, and the low notes are as twisting and turning as a swimming dragon. He is adept at singing Qingyi roles, and recent Qingyi singers have competed to follow the Cheng style. Cheng is usually as gentle as a Confucian scholar, unlike a performer. In his early years, he received assistance from Mr. Li Shizeng to perform abroad, and was very well received by people from other countries. He founded the Beiping Opera School and donated his property to be used as school buildings, which was highly praised for a time. Before he became famous, the late celebrity Mr. Yinggong tried his best to help him. After Luo died, Cheng personally buried him and was very generous. People in the artistic circle praised him for being full of affection and righteousness. He has sons, who are now studying in France, and Cheng uses all his earnings from performing to cultivate his sons. Last year, he was hired to go south, and his play "Locking the Scales" is still a popular hit. It is said that he will come to Shanghai again this year to perform at the Golden Grand Theatre.</p>

<p>— Yi Mingdao</p>
<p>At this time, Xu Jing was really in a dilemma, standing there thinking secretly. What Wang Yongtai said seemed to indicate that he already knew the truth of the matter, but in fact, he was still in the dark. How could he know! It must be that prostitute who deliberately used this handkerchief to frame me. Last night, she secretly fabricated stories in front of Wang Yongtai, twisted the facts, and said my fault, falsely accusing me in every way. And Wang Yongtai listened to these preconceived notions, suspecting that I had some improper behavior, so he rebuked me before I could even say anything. Alas! I was holding a heart full of loyalty, intending to give him loyal advice, but who knew that I would suffer an unjust grievance? This matter must be clarified so that he knows that I, Xu Jing, am an extraordinary man, how could I have immoral things? However, with his attitude of aloofness and rejecting people from a thousand miles away, it is also difficult for me to defend myself, and there is no way to clear my name. What should I do? After a long time, he suddenly thought of a way, and said to himself: "Okay, I will decide to do this, and a little delay will allow things to come to light. Where one is not welcomed, one can always find a place to stay. Since he asked me to leave, why should I shamelessly continue to eat and sleep here?" Thinking of this, he stamped his foot, gritted his teeth, and walked back to his room with his head down. Just as he stepped into the door, it suddenly made him stunned. (End of Chapter VIII)</p>
<p>Chapter IX: What Brings You to the Ends of the Earth, My Lord</p>
<p>Xu Jing stepped into his own room, and suddenly saw that the maid beside He Ji had already packed up his luggage and bedding and threw them on the bed. Seeing Xu Jing enter the room, she took out five taels of silver from her clothes, placed them on the table, and said with a smile: "I am under the order of Madam, to pack your luggage for you. Madam told me to tell you, you should leave well from now on, don't blame Madam, it's really that you yourself are too unfeeling. These five taels of silver are to send you as travelling expenses. Madam should have prepared a feast to see you off, but because you are unwilling to see her, she will not come to see you either. And there is one more thing to say, if you have nowhere to go after you leave and sincerely regret it, as long as you come here to ask to see her and are willing to listen to Madam's words, Madam can also explain everything for you in front of the master..." The maid said in a series of words, and Xu Qing felt a burst of anger early in the morning, thinking that this was clearly He Ji sending her to insult me. What a slut! Oh, I will have to let you know my power in the future. Then he glared at the maid and said: "Bah! What nonsense are you talking about? Shut up quickly. Your Master Xu doesn't want to hear your kind of talk. If you say it again, watch me slap you twice. What is this silver? Who cares about her stinking money? Are you here to make fun of me?" While speaking, he threw the silver on the ground, raised his fist with one hand, and made a threatening gesture. The maid was timid after all, and was so frightened that she slipped out of the room. Xu Qing sighed again and said: "Wang Yongtai! Wang Yongtai! It's a pity that your lifelong reputation will be ruined by this vixen!" (62)</p>

<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Analyze an "I" from the whole, I become a small "one." Transcend the whole, establish an "I," I become a big "one." Recognizing "I" as a big "one" is arrogance; recognizing "I" as a small "one" is mediocrity. The result of arrogance is the loss of human sociality and progress; the result of mediocrity is the loss of human self-esteem.</p>
