<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國目前所可為的</h3>
<p>「在現在，英國對中國，應該如何是好」？這一疑問，最近確是交流於許多正直的英國人士之間。希望獲得安心而滿意的解答。英國早就有明達的人士，到了現在，至少對於中國，對於遠東，明達者旣居大多數。在往年，遠東的禍根安在，中國抗戰的價値與影響安在，英國對此究負何種責任，究有何種關係，爲英國大多數人所不甚了了；他們以爲自有英國的辦法，自有英國不吃虧的辦法；這種錯覺，自今言之，完全過去了。現在大多數英國人士，允是正直的人們，皆能更進一步的透剔。他們確認：英國在歐洲戰勝而中國在亞洲戰敗，或英國在歐洲戰敗而中國在亞洲戰勝，乃爲理所不許，事所必無；蓋惟中英皆勝，中英全勝，纔得穩定國際全局，解決世界問題。吾則，一敗即兩敗，中英乃至世界與國際，全敗了，全完了。當然，這惟有明達者能體認，維有正直者肯承認。體認之餘，承認之餘，便得回想旣往；於是明達而正直者，雖不忽略當時的困難，然而無人沒有『悔不當初』之悔；以爲假定制止侵略於當初，問題豈若今日之艱鉅？過去了，怨允無益，悔之不及，於是問現在。</p>
<p>現在，中國强毅堅持其四年以來的精神，繼續作戰，損失已多，犧牲綦鉅；最後勝利之日雖愈近，艱難困苦之情却愈深；凡百建設悉由萌芽而欣欣向榮，然而落後；軍事配備，因陋就簡，惟期待自給之緩不濟急，斯期待外援如大旱雲霓。若使某一國，對中國祇是同情，則如何援助，但求盡心，惟力是視。英國者，在任何角度，任何方面，任何意義，任何立塲之下，皆有不擇手段，務期實效而以全力援華之必要者也。不幸英國具有援華最大可能之機會已過去。彼以海上之覇主稱，顧自北海而大西洋而地中海而紅海，方今處處爲勁敵所撩撥，爲勁敵所窺伺；局勢雖非危殆，然而嚴重；前途雖不渺茫，然而迢遠；悉力以赴，全神貫注。是以援華的理由依然，必要依然，而事勢限制之餘，援華的可能則遽减且銳减。正直的人們，安得不躊躇於如何是好！</p>
<p>在陸上，摧堅披銳如坦克，克敵致果如大砲；在空中，自衛的驅逐機，毀敵的轟炸機；在海面，反封鎖與反攻，有各級巨艦，各式小艇；這都是英國所有而中國所需。遠征軍在挪威登陸，在希臘登陸；海空軍向德國襲擊，向義國襲擊，這都是中國所艷羨而英國所優爲。假使英國根據了援華的理由，鑑察了援華的必要，自東方領屬，再東向進發，此所影響遠東大局，可信必然改觀；那時候，中國軍隊在中國領土之內，進行其掃盪肅淸的工作，則所收穫的車事功效，可信必然煊赫卓犖。不幸如此想像的景象，在旣往則未嘗有，在將來亦未必然，在現在爲不可能；所謂小可能，雖非絕對，却萬不宜强致。凡屬不宜或不可能，即爲中國所不求，亦爲英國所不爲。</p>
<p>中國所可求，英國所可爲，便是「如何是好？」的解答。昨日，英國外相艾登氏在下議院答復議員詢問，據倫敦電訉，當時聞者報以歡呼；而我們在得此電訉之後，亦願報以贊許。艾登氏表示：英國對中國之抵抗外國統治，勢力保持獨立，實予同情；又聲明旣往竭力助中國保獨立，今後亦然；且謂英國在領土內所行經濟限制的政策，當以決心進行。這是英國所可爲。至於中國所求，以目前而論，以對英國而論，決非求英國分其陸海空軍的任何些小力量，參加遠東戰局，幫助中國作戰，中國祇求英國儘量的，迅速的，嚴格的爲所可爲；即明辨所謂「敵」的對象與意義及範圍，在經濟方面，不但『保持供應品以備已用，而免轉入「敵」手』，且將軍事的，商業的，乃至農工業的，一切貨品，不問英國剩餘與吾，英國缺乏與吾，絕對的絲毫不供給，絲毫不消納。</p>

<p>倫敦　據今日所知、希特勒代表赫斯於飛抵蘇格蘭四十八小時之內、已與哈密頓公爵會晤、事後有報吿送達倫敦、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>函致公爵</p>
<p>而公爵立將此函轉送英當局、未予答復、戰前公爵曾因體育事件與赫期晤過一·二次、因二人皆注意於體育運動也、赫斯所遺之地圖、以藍鉛筆標出由奧格斯堡至蘇格蘭之航程者、其終止之點、爲鄧加夫爾、其地乃哈密頓爵邸所在處、赫斯於星期六夜降落後、即向農夫麥克倫訽問往鄧加夫爾之路、赫斯誤認一巨宅爲哈密頓爵邸、未見有適當降機之處、乃張傘躍下、雖足踝受傷、然欲人導往爵邸、蓋渠以爲爵邸近在咫尺也、據德國通訊社消息、一九三六年世運大會中、赫斯曾與哈密　晤面、赫斯降落後、曾向鄉人述德國境內所感之艱辛及因英空軍轟炸而起之</p>

<p>之唯一安全國內矣、聞赫期留函責希特勒破壞其立黨之原則、至於赫斯來英表示德國現入於最後掙扎之說、則殊不爲人置信、赫斯此來或因渠不贊成德國戰爭政府、而自認渠可提出兩國和平條件、惟有可斷言者、英國抱定作戰到底不勝不止之決心、赫斯終有此提議、亦不能在英國發生影響也、據巴斯勒報柏林訪電言、柏林官塲承認赫斯留置之函、絕無神經錯亂之徵象、惟警吿國人勿信英國傳來關於赫斯之消息、謂英國將利用此事供宣傳用途、而英國所傳之赫斯言論、係在威脅下而發者也云、昨日蘇格蘭警廳特派警員檢查入醫院訪赫斯之人、醫院門口駐有軍警、非特許者不准入內、拍電影者多人、包圍蘇格蘭農夫麥克倫、請其表演</p>

<h3>歐戰業談　（五）（六）　倫敦大火記</h3>
<p>倫敦曾在一六六六年發生過一次大火，燒了七日七夜。一九四〇年十二月二十九日，大批德機夜襲倫敦，又引起一度大火，茲將「紐的泰晤士報」及「讀者文摘」的專電紀載，譯綠如次：</p>
<p>英國現在有一道新防綫，那是在全國的屋頂上。所防的敵人是「火」夜中警報亂嗚，第一批敵機擲下的燒夷彈和小炸彈，在各種建築物上爆發起火。若不立即撲滅，那麼星星之火，可以燎原，不免要釀成巨災，而且火光燭天，使載着猛烈爆炸物的轟炸機得以看淸目標，康文屆萊城已受過一次慘痛的敎訓了。</p>
<p>英國各地火防瞭望隊現在已經組織起來，專門管理屋頂，撲滅敵機擲下的燒夷彈，不會火勢蔓延。假使配備周全，行動敏捷，要消減一個燒夾彈，可以迅速成功。問題是每所房屋都應有人守望，這一點已由商業區和住宅區的特別組織予以解決了。</p>
<p>在大商店中，僱主可令僱員輪班守夜，注意燒夷彈的落下。每個職員擔任這種義務，以每月不超過四十八小時爲限。小商店則可聯合採取互衛制度，由各店職員分任守望之責。大公寓和大旅館的屋頂衛士，不但由僱員擔任，亦可從寓客中招募。大商店的火防瞭望係屬强迫性質，因爲在大規模空襲中，黑夜無人之所，往往變成，一片然土，連隣近的房屋也被殃及。</p>
<p>至于住宅區內，因爲在最危險的轟炸時間，大多數房屋皆有人居住，所以火防瞭望純係志願服務，由各人自吿奮勇。主婦時時都準備着使用滅火機和沙土，以防禦燒夷彈。左鄰右舍往往組成巡邏隊，以抵抗從天而降的回祿威脅。</p>
<p>當德機企圖燒毀倫敦的那一夜，就是去年十二月二十九日那夜，記者和馬格利小姐同觀卓別林的「獨裁大家」影片。馬格利芳齡二十五歲，容貌映麗，是一個半英半法的女郞，英法兩種語言都能够說，她常替巴黎晨報工作，她逃出巴黎時僅先德軍一步，隨後跑到倫教，現在仍舊擔任女記者。</p>
<p>電影在四點半鐘開映，正當第四本開始時，忽聞空襲警報聲大作，銀幕上映出一條通吿，說明觀衆者願意離開，儘可出去，躱入防空室中，却沒有一個人走開。十五分鐘以後，我們覺得全部包廂都在前後搖動，想是近處有大炸彈一枚落下，致受震動，我們雖誰都不說，但知道，戲院外面，必已十分緊張了。</p>
<p>七點鐘電影映完，出了影戲院，但覺市內情形爲生平所未見。倫教好像已變成西席地密爾所導演的「羅馬大火記」五彩影片中所映出的羅馬了。天空一片紅光，夾雜着一團一團橙黃色的火燄。雖然那時已値黃昏，却是照耀得如同白晝，馬格利小姐口上脣膏的濃談，淸晰可辨。</p>
<p>我們本要去吃晚餐，可是馬格利先要到報館去校對她在下午所寫一篇新聞稿。整個事務所中闃無一人，最後纔零着這班辦事人員都在地下室中，和機器捲筒紙作伴。他們正在做校對的工作。那所房屋，構造不很結實，所以他們一起跑入地窖，直到落下的炸彈稀少後方始出來，馬格利把新開稿校對完畢，我們就一同出發，尋覓未曾打烊的飯館。</p>
<p>街上行人多有慌張之色，聽得近處炸彈的呼嘯聲時，他們却拔步飛奔，但馬格利却不願隨衆奔走。西席地密爾影片中的紅光，照耀着一切，你可以看見各人的面部，可以看出何人受驚，及受驚時的神情怎樣，但是不慌不亂的人實在少見。（未完）</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米跌勢　已成鐵註</h3>
<p>洋米昨日仍乏轉機氣象、現米雖呈盤旋局勢、而期貨受廉米後批影響、再度趨跌、允以碎米籌碼浮存太多、競相吐售、市面乃見疲莫能興、碎米英華司（一石二斗半）昨晨開價爲一百零八元半、已與前晚所喊之低價相似、比前午售開價小二元、繼因賣多進少、即自一百零七元、六元、小至一百零五元、乃比前午猛落五元半之鉅、小絞原包（一石二斗半）亦降開一百三十八元、西貢二號祗一百三十六元、一號自一百四十元開價小至一百三十六元半、均比前日小至一二元、現米開盤已疲弱無神、開價允比前日晚市爲疲、旋至本客趁小問津、大戶亦稍擯守、市乃略見回定、午後又以浮戶心虛求吐見軟、全日成交七千多包、英華司八九百噸、西貢一號一百二十三元至一百二十一元、二號一百十五元半至一百十四元半、小絞一百十五元至一百十二元、敏黨一百十六元至一百十四元、碎米九十元、次至七十八元、</p>

<h3>洋粉動盪不定</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、升降不定、蓋以米價步落不已、及定粉絡繹到滬聲中、人心目難振奮、惟業內囤戶逢低卽有吸收、南洋幫客銷亦稍趁廉收買、故市面欲跌又止、今市做開花鳥牌澳粉二百包、價三十一元二角五分、砲台牌美粉三十元零八九角、及金龍牌坎粉三十元零五角至六七角、成交總計一萬餘包、華廠平賣粉概如原狀、暫無變動、市面前途、亦在浮盪不定中、</p>
<p>小麥市况、仍居擯局、蓋以市塲供源早枯、買賣均吿袖手，日廠門市收貨、亦已寥若晨星、聞目下高杜麥市價四十五六元、比前又暗鬆一二元、但無正式做開、</p>
<h3>雜糧　苞米盛極而衰</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市面、都在疲軟璧曇下掙扎、總之有猛漲必有暴跌、一路笑一路哭、亦市塲之慣見、現下多頭失利、空頭方在欣欣向榮、昨苞米先跌後砌、但其潛勢、仍疲莫能興、結果續跌一元四五角、計成交現貨二千餘包、期貨五十噸、開西貢陳貨價爲二十七元五角至二十八元、新貨價爲二十九元二角半至三十元、現貨英華司五十六元、荷蘭白苞米爲三十元零五角、黃苞米價爲三十一元五角至三十二元、訂四月下交五月上交（包水脚）價爲六十元、</p>

<p>初有洋米荷糖結款</p>
<p>晨外雷自銀市仍一致未更、國際匯兌美　滬復升二分、餘無變動、中央掛牌各滙未更、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英匯三辦士二八一二五、美金五元三四三七五、均與上日收價同、聞有洋米及荷糖結款、市勢致稍帶軟、本月美匯僅結五元三一二五、匯豐掛牌各匯未更、白銀平衡稅仍徵百分之二四·五〇、正金進某行英金三辦士二八一二五、但至十點半光景、忽起利空傳說、市勢當見轉緊、回平、有利與浙實進美商等行五六月美金五元三四三七五、午刻趨穩定、午後與晨開價同、</p>
<p>外商港電均有供給</p>
<p>下午初少變動、及聞美元又有貶値空氣、故雖有投機家套扒五月五元三四三七五、而港電道亨及外銀行均有供意、下月美金五元三七五聞曾可結、但不久即回平、乃金價重見盤上也、四點收市現貨及六月英金三辦士一八一二五、美金五元三四三七五、比與上日收R價仍同、</p>

<h3>消息紛歧　金市投機</h3>
<p>彷徨失所</p>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、始高繼忽轉低、各方人心極形不定、乃國內外消息與謠傳、利多利空莫衷一是、於晨開時旣承上日收後漲勢、又在美匯軟至五元三一二五之際、遂以六千五百元本日高價開市、鑫源·成記出籠、買風消散、頓起回風、且傳中英美軍事同盟、外滙由緊回平、同康永一再拋賣、價愈盤愈低、下午美元貶値說父起、故在賣風中退見六千四百四上三元、外滙未稍軋鬆、義元仁承永力進、盤升二十餘元、終爲六千四百六十三元、軋升十七元、全日交易七八萬兩、掉期（五）月轉入六月）成記·祥和等買方進由五十三元低至五十元、益大等貼出又回平、仍五十三元、成交頗多、現金永成出一百八十兩、祥和出一百兩、泰康潤出三十兩、均照期交價高一百九十元、由成記買進、下午未成交、高一百九十五元有買戶、價軋升二十餘元、飾金先漲後回平、仍六百八十五元、</p>
<p>烚赤所漲甚微</p>
<p>自晨六月期每條（十兩）、因上日午收後人心已向上、美金又帶緊、價遂抬上、九點十五分開市爲六千五百元、比上日午收價高五十四元、鑫源同康永成記恒記新豐永力售、始壓下至六千四百七十二元、證券幫德孚買進、抬至六千四百八十七元、又聞利空傳說、新豐永·天元·成記·大豐·同康永力售、退至六千四百五十元、祥和·益大買進、午刻抬升至六千四百八十二元、同康永再賣、小至六千四百六十七元、午收六千四百七十三元、下午二點開市六千四百七十元、公和·義元來力售、且美元貶値傳說又起、美金下月五兀三七五亦難賣、價遂猛落二十餘元、退至六千四百四十三元、仁承永·成記證券幫力進、當又提上、散戶收吸、步升至六千四百七十四元、鑫源·德孚·新豐永·義元售出、進至六千四百五十七元、四點收市六千四百六十三元、比上日收價軋升十七元、照六月美金漲價仍五元三四三七五、爲六千五百十七元、計撳五十四元、收後六千四百六十五元、全日有五十七元上落、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高二百十兀、收進比售出低七十元、現標金仍無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金欲大又止</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行晨九點半升五元、計六百九十元、下午三點回低五元、仍掛六百八十五元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>美鈔掉期　—賣方貼出三四分—</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、給赤市價略漲、英美金鎊因亦各升一元、英金票呆定如故市價站平、美金票又屆掉期、初尙平穩、最後賣方須貼予買方三四分、新月期最高會到四角一分、最後價爲十八元三角四分、比上日軋升二分、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票及朝鮮票均無上落、前者仍爲二元零八分、後者仍爲一元七角八分、</p>
<h3>證券　內債午後抬高</h3>
<p>公債暗盤昨日市况、上午趨跌、下午又有拉抬者、反見上漲、司見多方一再努力、而一部份多頭乃得善價出籠、此種畸形發展、究非正軌、因連日塲內頗有一般做手、每逢跌落即羣趨而抬價、但亦往往能引起一部份人之看好、是以市價稍一回小、即有人抬高、未來之變化、當於此無情的抬價中發生鉅大波瀾、昨日上午聯和·同康·買進、聯益·恒益·賣出、市價會跌落二三角、午收又稍稍回高、午後聯和再來抬價　進、因鴻大亦有需要、丙種瞬即出六元、在六元關幾度進出、終被抬住、在六元外收盤、其時樂茂出籠、乃得善價、大華鼎康亦有吐出、收盤比隔日又好起一角牛至六角不等、成交總數、的計二百萬有零、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司股一百股、價爲三十三元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、竟日黯澹非凡、價格升降極微、下午市况、呆中帶軟、橡皮股成交寥寥、</p>
<p>倫敦十四日（週三）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、滙豐銀行英倫註册股獨升半鎊、爲七十二鎊半、餘無變動</p>
<h3>英古達橡樹派息</h3>
<p>英商滙通洋行經理之央古達除橡樹有限公司、定於五月二十八日召開第三十一次常年股東大會、並派一九四〇年份禾次股息、每股國幣一元二角、連中期全年共派國幣三元、</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭籌碼關閉　紗市復昂　雙馬近五百元關</h3>
<p>紗市續見良好、此因一般財力充足之戶、在但峯時復來拖進一批、與高價一扯、不致吃虧、同時有一部份籌碼被多方吸收、關閉不放、於是市塲上成交數量甚旺、空方掉期不能貼進利率、由此大衆都說棧單缺乏、每日收棧單要到八九點鐘方才舒齊、就此而論、利於多頭、加之外洋美印棉市、一致飛騰、又屬利漲、所以買方意態殊强、看漲心思復濃、不過又有人說、美花是漲、外匯耍長、標金向下、如果出五百元外、不妨賣出也、二十支變馬高價爲一千四百九十四元、低價爲一千四百八十二元、午後初做價爲一千四百九十四元、漲至一千四百九十九元、旋以金價回下、跌至一千四百八十六元、但人心仍佳、最後又回至一千四白九十四元云、今日有棉紗一千一百四十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因上日午後人氣轉好、且價格回上、多頭又不虧本、所以塲中買勢態强、首盤價爲一千四百八十五元、少頃漲至一千四百九十四元、此時大槪散戶扒空、旋聞標金平平、外匯勿動、又復回鬆至一千四百八十四元、然檯面已屬　多頭地位、人心堅昂、大都看高、以印棉大跳、買勢挺秀、再升至一千四百九十四元、收盤價爲一千四百九十二元、查半日間成交　計一萬零七百零五包、內同行佔一萬包、香港七百零五包、</p>
<h3>美印棉一再飛漲　棉市人心看高</h3>
<p>現棉情况隨外棉而趨良好、同業人心因美印棉市一律飛升、大都望高、但廠方則不願於此際作鉅價之購納、各號家亦無意大膽拉進、致交易頗難暢達、徵聞申新廠因最近粗紗銷路暢盛、近補進火機棉原料不少云云、</p>
<p>米得林四二五·五　號家一二五件棧交</p>
<p>又　四二五　又　一〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>又普通四一六　又　一〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、成交雖不多、但因紗市已有轉機、及美印棉一再飛漲、故人心一致看高、同時一般執有手貨者、皆不願輕易脫售也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市，晨初即因大衆消費量龐大，及華盛頓政治消息、參議院同意百分之八五貸款而高漲、但續後又因一部份獲利了結而稍低、結果收盤價格、較之上日的漲十三四磅音、</p>
<p>又華盛頓電、統計局發表四月份美國棉業統計錄左、（花衣單位千包、錠子單位千枚）</p>
<p>印度棉市先因散戶了結而跌、繼之又因空頭抵補活躍而回漲、續後再因買方不斷購進、及存底稀少、市况突飛猛進、結果收盤價格、除白洛去四五月份獨漲三十八羅比外、其餘各漲十餘羅比不等、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况看低五·七五羅比、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白跌風更甚</h3>
<p>昨糖市因連日步跌、人心虛戰更甚、續見銳降、故全日市價動盪不定、上落亦在三元四五角之多、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧一百零六元二角、比前（十三）跌五元三角、五月二十日期粗白初爲一百零八元四角·七角·五角·至八元、旋轉降爲一百零七元·六元三角·五元六角、中途回至六元九角、忽小至五元、後以五元九角·六元收盤、跌四元四角、五月底期亦一百零九元開盤、初尙佳爲九元二角四角·至九元、旋降至八元七角·八元，七元·六元七角·四角·三角、直至五元九角·七角、後稍振爲一百零六元一二角、更至七元五角·四角·三角半·二角半·三角、而以七元三角半收盤、跌三元許、太古車白B嘜一百十元、跌二元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粗布粗斜　售盤差別七元餘</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢平穩、實需平淡、投機份子亦多數按兵不動、各布售盤因存底厚薄關係、有絕大差別、如十六磅粗布與粗斜成本相等、而現市粗斜較粗布提高（每疋）七元外、下擋細斜近亦見缺乏、獨細布過剩、申大廠七十八碼斜紋現開價七十七元、較前日升一元、餘擋漲二角半、粗布粗斜因廠盤提高、每漲二角半、細布反見疲洛二二角、本街成交坯布等三百餘件、粵港幫續辦粗細斜紋色斜等二百餘件、新加坡辦漂白印花布三千餘疋、今有疋頭二千〇五十件運杳港、</p>
<p>東布　先漲後跌白貨龍頭細布晨開見四十九元五六角、嗣以實銷不振、賣戶紛起、逐步盤小、下午牧市價爲四十八元九角、色貨四君子嗶嘰一元五角二分二五、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子滯銷</h3>
<p>黑鐵坯子市面、昨日依然無多大成交、蓋海外客商採辦岑寂、所銷僅屬本街興罐廠·印鐵廠·及機器廠家等、而交易之數、又並不衆多、故而整個市象、未見熱閙、查同業人心亦因去化之呆滯、而水敢挺昂、標　行盤亦因軟弱、如新鋼廠二千磅每紮沽開三千二百元、老鋼廠貨則每捆售三千三百元、比前均各落五十元左右、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新笋乾首批在途</h3>
<p>靑笋干現屆登新之期、聞首批天目尖已運出在途、不日即可抵申、據云今庚產價極昂、即新鮮笋坯、每斤竟需一元許、如是則十貨之昂、可以想見、</p>

<h3>希望</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>人皆有其希望，所不同的就在不同而已。</p>
<p>希望也有程度：濃摩者曰熱望，急切者曰渴望，近乎不可能者曰奢……最「不吉利」的自然是失望！</p>
<p>希望還有範圍：奸商希望謠言蠭起，囤戶希望有其貼價在高，窮措大則希望能有破衣蔽身，薄粥果腹！採辦小紋米的確能源源而來，多多益善，而且分配均勻，不再受奸商的剝削。</p>
<p>本來現在什麽都在顚倒黑白之中，希望當未能例外；然而我們決不絕望，我們還有熱力。</p>
<p>固然，希望愈奢，愈能「如願」希望得太低，便愈會失望，甚至僅僅希望句延一下殘喘，也屬不可能。可是我們現在的「熱望」倒要擴大些了。</p>
<p>以前無望的現在也不必再奢望了；以前失望的，現在却更不能讓它失望下去！</p>
<h3>「神經病學徒」自白</h3>
<p>— 孫堅白</p>
<p>—「教訓這些孩子」—</p>
<p>閒了好久了，人瞧歷着不好，自己也感看不舒服，既然承姨父的好意，蔫我到一家號子裏當練習生，那當然也得滿口的道謝，別的不說，至少吃開了一張嘴—爸和媽這末想，我也這末想。</p>
<p>號子裏幹的是哪種事？當練習生該做些什麽？我全不明白，我想問，可是找不到對手，號裏不是沒有人，可是那兩個傢伙，全是鼻子朝天的那付架子！看了就滿肚烏氣，不懂就不懂，要看那兩付「直臉」，那可不成！</p>
<p>日子在糊裏糊塗中過去，我的工作是寫黑板和報行情，雖是每月也得個三十大元的工錢，可是，想起了這是在替那些搗亂社會，操縱物價的投機商們幼力，便老想丟手不幹！當然，我只是那末想罷了；我是怕閒的人！</p>
<p>老含糊也不成，總得大家有個談說的機會。一天早晨，我便特地買了包捲烟，帶到號裏，想請他們吸了，彼此間打破冷淡。</p>
<p>我才把捲烟敬給那個瘦瘦臉姓李的賬房，事情就鬧成了僵局，那傢伙沒接我的烟，也不說不要，只是哈哈的笑了幾聲，一手就在自己袋裏掏出了一包「茄立克」抽出一枝，點上火，便吸了起來，眼睛直瞧着玻璃窗。</p>
<p>我沒作聲，回頭去瞧瞧另一個姓韓的，那傢伙也正發着輕視的冷笑，我低頭瞧瞧自己的藍布褂子，雖然有十個補過的疙瘩，可是媽給我洗得挺乾淨，沒有些見油跡，墨痕；這又爲什麼，他要這末瞧小起我？爲了我不是本地人嗎？爲了我窮嗎？爲了我……倒底爲了啥呢？</p>
<p>於是我開口說了：「李先生！我的烟雖然太壞了，可是你却不該就這樣瞧不起人啊！」</p>
<p>「你是學生　的！用不到管人家待你怎樣，那邊的痰盂拿去倒倒，茶　不在，這事就該你做！那　蹩脚香烟，你自己吸罷！不過在此地，你不許吸！」那瘦子說完，眼睛火着，臉上的肉，全繃直着。</p>
<p>我的性子全發起來了！投機事業的容易賺錢，養成了這傢伙的「奢侈」和「驕傲」我怎樣也忘不了自己曾當過敎帥，敎訓過許多的孩子，我覺得我必須也敎訓敎訓這瘦子，我的手伸出去了，「拍」的一聲，便把那「瘦臉」打得歪了過去，心裏却直感着痛快。</p>
<p>瘦子給打急了，合着那個姓韓的，衝到我面前來，可不敢動手，祇嘴裏駡着，聲音却是挺響亮的。</p>
<p>等到隔室的鄰人，來勸開我們時，我們二人的長袍都扯碎了，兩個傢伙，全給我打了個舒服！</p>
<p>老板退了我的職，說我有「神經病」，我撤開腿就跑回家去。老子不幹你家事，也餓不死！</p>
<p>人們全背着我說「神經病」，我自己想起那回事來，也覺得奇怪，最可笑那瘦子挨我第一巴子時，全夢想不到，他駡我野獸，駡我流氓，駡狄强盜，我全不理會，我只覺得自己幹得全不錯，這年頭兒，誰欺侮我，就揍誰！</p>
<h3>乞丐藝術</h3>
<p>— 司馬駿</p>
<p>乞丐的藝術，很少有人去注意牠，即使注意一些也吧，其實，乞丐藝術，有値得「欣賞」」的地方，但是他緊跟着你討錢時，那眞叫厭惡。</p>
<p>不是乞丐有幾　幾樣，於是他的「藝術」也就各異。</p>
<p>上門求乞的，除去喊幾聲「老闆先生」之外，呑鐵彈，穿鍊條，頂碗，這是硬碰硬的藝術，看着他把一口大小的鐵彈，從嘴裏呑到肚內，再用劍往喉口仲，眞叫人欽佩一條鍊，條能從鼻空穿到嘴，根竹筷能將碗頂起，這稱我想比馬戲班的藝術偉大，因爲這些眞功夫，祇求賞幾分錢，不靠吹牛，不靠宣傳。</p>
<p>至於馬路上的乞丐，他們是靠他「三寸不爛之舌」，跟在人後，少爺長，先生短，老爺闊，在叫幾聲，然而他的藝術，那就是話不斷嘴，像連串的滾出來，天氣熱他會拿蒲扇向你後搖扇着，有時也會叫一聲，「少爺當心水堆」。</p>
<p>然而有人以爲最「起碼」的是吿地狀了，他仕人寫了一張「履歷」，訴儘了痛苦，求懇「仁人君子一之同情，佈賜幾文。不過這種人想要些「向子」，其實這「面子」，人們能看出他「夾裏」的。</p>
<p>綜觀以上的乞丐藝術，上門的是「實事求是」，吿地狀等這些方法，假使一拆穿，或許是「一文不値」。</p>
<p>學府風光</p>
<h3>最後一課</h3>
<p>— 柱湖</p>
<p>「喔，小王，你來好早。」</p>
<p>「你也早呀，老陳。」</p>
<p>時鐘明明指着，距離上課時間，祇有五分鐘了。老陳把書本子使勁往桌上一丟，於是轉過身來，從褲袋中抽出三砲臺，遞了一支給小王。</p>
<p>「老陳，聽老曹說，你囤了不少煤，是不是？」</p>
<p>「早又出脫了，運氣倒還好，要是再不出說，恐怕要犯上風險哩！」老陳笑着回答。</p>
<p>「是呀，我本來有朋友，同我合平囤五金貨，後來講不台，就沒有囤，眞的，五金貨曾一度低落，不過現父回漲了。」小王撣了撣烟灰。</p>
<p>課室內陸續來了不少同意，高個子的阿高，一跨進課室門，就拉住了老陳問：</p>
<p>「老楊怎的不來？吿假嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，今天密司沈的他去看『風流豪客』，託我替他代到一下。」老陳回答。</p>
<p>「眞糟糕，人家等着他一百箱洋燭的回音，他倒撇在腦後，好樂子。」阿高正氣憤憤地訴說，突聽見皮鞋聲蠢蠢，他高興地跳了起來，揚着手說：「哈囉，密司殷，五點半戲票，我買好了，大光明「海上英雄。』」</p>
<p>女的把手撈了一下耳勞的變髮，淡淡地。</p>
<p>阿高仍是賊怎嘻嘻地說：</p>
<p>「不管影　好不好，看了出來，可到新雅吃飯，飯後冉去米高美坐一陣，不是好嗎？」</p>
<p>密司殷來不及點頭，西裝畢挺的講師，進來了。點完名，學生的聲音，又紛擾起來：</p>
<p>「先生，不要講書，談談時事吧？」</p>
<p>「美日關係的近狀，應作怎樣觀察？」</p>
<p>「赫斯貨什麽要私離德國？」</p>
<p>「別談國際，談上海吧！」</p>
<p>「對呀！上海的米價，還會回漲嗎？日用品那幾種會漲的？」</p>
<p>講師沒話說，他笑了笑，整理了下領帶，開始講述最近的時事發展；由國際談到上海。學生們靜靜聽着，偶然私下交語着一二句：</p>
<p>「我看我們囤些日用品吧！」</p>
<p>「不，與其囤，還是弄些股票好！」</p>
<p>阿高摸出金壳錶一看，五點快了，站起身米打了一個眼色給密司殷，密司殷也跟着站起身來。</p>
<p>下課了，講師將預備走，踩室外又被學生包圍住：</p>
<p>「×先生，你囤什麼貨，我來一股阿好？」</p>
<p>「我也來一股，×先生，你沒事嗎？一起去吧！我請客。」</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>因爲這樣，雖然接連幾大紹文都在醫院裏坐了好許多時候，用各種言語去勸慰他，而秋海棠却還是非吃安眠藥不能睡覺，並且每次睡熟也總是短短的一兩小時，以致精神逐漸繼得衰頹起來。</p>
<p>「你家中的事，羅小姐的事，以及季兆雄那個狗才的事，我可以一古腦兒的給你依次辦好！」這一天，紹文爲了公事和私事的催迫，不能不隨着袁寳藩一起離開天津了，臨走時便又冉三的向秋海棠可嚀着：「現在你自己無論怎樣想也是沒用的，反徒然苦了你的身體！萬一我把一切事都給你辦好了，你自己却一病不起，那豈不白白費了我許多的心血？所以，好兄弟，請聽我的話，且安心靜養吧！我回到北京以後，至少給你三天來一次信，我想用不到你出院，我就有很好的消息吿訴你了！」</p>
<p>紹文一路說，一路不住的對他發出很眞切的微笑來，希望可以多少鬆解他一些心事；但秋海棠所懷着的滿腔憂鬱，却還像凍得最結實的冰塊一樣的不易溶解。</p>
<p>後來的三天中，他不但睡的時候很少，連食量也减退到比一個害內症的病人還不如了。儘管紹文所替他預付的醫藥費還留剩得很多，但大夫們也不由不開始憂慮起來；因爲無論醫生和病人怎樣的漢不相關，但治好一個病人，當然總要比眼看一個病人死去痛快一些！</p>
<p>「十號房間的病人今天情形更不好了，簡直有些神志昏迷的模樣，方才連喝的牛奶也一起嘔出來了。」一個女看護忽忽地走進辦公室去，向那三位住院醫師報吿着。（一〇七）</p>

<p>逰藝界</p>
<h3>「卡通」作家　華德狄斯耐的新貢獻</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>「幻想曲」中表演新技巧</p>
<p>卡通畫片的成立，遠在電影之前，一八二四年在歐洲幻燈片發明的時候，「卡通」的歷史就開始了。「卡通」第二步的進展，就是把它們從畫片再經過攝影而成。近幾年來，卡通影片已經進步到有聲有色，有許多奇怪怪的塲面和動作了。普通影片裏看不到的，都可以由一支筆的描書，在卡通片中都能看到，因爲卡通片每寸每格都用手細心地畫成，所以製作上很費時日。一部卡通片放映時間，普通的自二十分鐘至三十分鐘。</p>
<p>過去，卡通片都是短片，而短片中以「米老鼠」畫得最好，因之畫米老鼠的華德狄斯耐，就此成了名，他具有超人的藝術天才，兼有堅忍的毅力，從事製作「卡通」，孜孜不倦，技術日臻化境，無疑的，他現在已經成了影城中卡通權威作家了。</p>
<p>由於卡通片的受人歡迎，在華德狄斯耐的奮鬥下，長篇的卡通片終於問世，「白雪公主」一片震驚了藝壇，風靡了全球觀衆，因爲繪製生動細膩，這部空前的長篇卡通影片，打破了影片賣座紀錄，當選爲前年十大名片之一。</p>
<p>繼「白雪公主」之後有弗理立區的「小人國」產生，但因爲繪製等方面，技巧不逮狄斯耐，所以未能予觀衆以很好的印象。狄斯耐於「白雪公主」後的作品為「木偶奇遇記」雖然這部卡通片也是成菌的，但不及「白雪公主」那樣的被觀衆稱譽</p>
<p>他第三部五彩卡通長片，題名是「幻想曲」本來決定在去年聖誕節前完成，可是後來為了製作上的延擱，直到最近方全部剪接就緒，在好萊塢正式開映。在這部卡通片中，華德狄斯耐不但用盡了他所有的繪畫藝術才能，並且在音樂上也有極大的成就。本片一切的龍面上的動作與色彩，完全是和音樂配合的，裹面有史托考夫斯基改編的裴多芬的「田園交響曲」與史脫拉文斯基的「大地之春」，還有更値得注意的，便是修培爾德的“Ave　Maria”的形象化，這種新的嘗試，在過去，我們是從未見過的。</p>
<p>狄斯耐完成卡通片「幻想曲」後，目前正開始製作另一部新片，片名“The　Reluetant　Dragon”在木片寡他貢獻了一種新的技巧，就是眞人和卡通人物一同演戲，即此一點，你可知道其內容的新奇了。</p>
<h3>王熙春胃病復發</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>「碧蘿公主」暫停工作</p>
<p>王熙春，這美耀的小鳥，三年以來，實在紅遍劇影兩界了。然而，藝人的生活並不如一般幻想的美麗，愈是飲名，痛苦却也跟着來，浮面的愉快不足代表內心的。</p>
<p>試想：她一方面要在卡爾登演皮黃劇，一方面經常地在合衆幹水銀燈下工作，同時，金星國聯當局，又要請她客串主演一二部戲。這樣，應付三方面的緊張工作，她瘦弱的身體如何能够支撐？又因飲食不不調勻，終於使她患得了胃病</p>
<p>十多天前，正當她在合家攝「碧蘿公主」時，她的胃病突發，以致當塲嘔吐，險些昏倒過去。後來返家，在卡爾登要演唱的「龍鳳呈祥」，也請人代演，休養兩天，才漸漸痊愈了</p>
<p>最近，言菊朋假座卡爾登演出，照理，在她創够獲到一個休息機會了。不料她的胃病，在昨天又復發了，病勢却又相當嚴　，於是不得不睡倒床上，請西醫診治。至於合衆的「碧蘿公主」，也就祗得暫停工作了。</p>
<h3>藝壇簡報</h3>
<p>胡蝶繼「孔雀東南飛後之新作血淚相思寨」一劇，茲因片名不够刺激，故已決定易名爲「鑄情」，並定於下月初旬正式開拍，導演仍由王决龍擔任。</p>
<p>舞台劇人繼喬奇後加入金星者，已有上海劇藝社之沈敏英子兩人，並聞沈敏業已被派在「花濺淚」一片中飾演顧小妹一角。</p>
<p>滬光下期公映者，本已內定岳楓之「碧海靑犬」，現因該片尙須補拍鏡頭數個，故已決定將藝華之「新茶花女」提前公映。</p>
<p>越劇皇后姚水娟曾一度計劃將「遺腹子」一劇搬上銀幕，旋因向銀錢業界集資未成，故姚已決心打消前議。</p>
<p>東方飯店話劇團最近公演之「婚姻交響曲」，即係選取十大名劇之一，該劇係由陳白塵之「微婚」，戈果里之「求婚」「結婚」與「離婚」等獨幕劇綜合編製而成，並由影人黃魯導演，故近日賣座頓見起色。</p>
<p>在「西廂記」片中飾演琴童之陶由，已於本月十一日在南京路冠生園茶室與本埠某女校高材生錢某者訂婚，是日計到影人鄭小秋，秦煒，陳重，周起等十餘人。</p>
<p>李紅突病，新作「魂歸何處」不得已暫停攝製。</p>
<p>金星繼「孤島春秋」　之新片，已決定爲「雨夜槍聲」，按該劇係根據申報副刊連續刋載之長篇小說「舞后的歸宿」所改編而成，由周曼華領銜主演，編劇一職將仍由原著人程小靑改編，導演則由新進金星之偵探片權威徐欣夫擔任。</p>
<p>大十海大劇院決自六月底改歸五德公司經營，暫以六個月爲試辦期，一切由張善琨負責主持，聞該院經理一職，以任矜蘋卞毓　呼聲紋高。</p>
<p>民華第二部名片「世界兒女」中之大段　語　白，業巳被當局決定後，全數刪除，且曾得該片　籍導演茀萊克之同意。</p>

<p>許靖心中正在奇怪那枝響鏢從何而來，只聽那　嶺上　喝一聲，有一個美少年飛奔而下，頭戴武生巾，身披綠色單綢袍子，脚踏快靴，而如冠玉，修眉人鬢，兩頰紅紅的父俊秀，又英爽。許靖不覺看得呆了。那美少年也向許靖打量了一回，覺得許靖也是個　俊少年，不是凡夫俗子，便向他拱手道：「客從何來？此地山中豺狼甚多，白晝也要出噬人畜。方纔我從嶺上下來，恰巧遇見足下和那畜生狠鬥，恐怕那畜生傷了足下，想要拔刀相助，又苦手中沒有兵器，幸得身邊帶得一個鏢獲，因此發了一鏢，僥倖把那孽畜擊斃，幸恕孟浪。許靖聽那少年吐語斯文，不由更是敬佩。因那少年問他從何處來此，自己却又不便明言其故，祇得說道：「小弟姓許名靖，是從河南杞縣到此，投親不遇，徘徊山中，忽逢豺狼，幸君仗義救助，感何如之？足下一鏢　斃兇狼，非有絕技的人不辦，還請賜吿姓名，俾得書紳」。那美少年聞言一笑這：「蒙許君過譽，愧不敢當。小弟姓柳，名隱英，自幼本是江南人氏，後來流落在北方。此番至代州也是探望親戚，因小弟的姑父姑母隱居在此。但是旣來之後，姑父忽患病去世，姑母一時不放我走，遂淹居於此。閒着沒事做，常到山上來散步。我儕萍水相逢，也是巧極。許君旣然投親不遇，何妨到我姑母家裹暫時小住，待你探明白了令戚的去處，再作道理。」許靖聽着，止中下懷，遂把寳劍插入鞘中，向少年拱拱手道：「柳兄，我們初次邂逅，即承垂注。小弟正苦沒有食宿之處，蒙柳兄懷慨爲懷，雅意寵招，眞是不勝感激之至。令姑母的府第就在這山中嗎？」柳隱英點點頭道：「是的，此山名喚威鳳山，這嶺便名鳳凰嶺，我姑母的家使住在這鳳凰嶺上，和足下方纔走過的梭猊嶺是相對的，請許君隨我去吧。」　（六四）</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden Provides Assurance: Aiding China in Maintaining Independence; Japan Rejects British Economic Interests in China; Britain Resolves on a Fixed Policy to Cope</h3>
<p>London - During yesterday's House of Commons session, a Member of Parliament requested Foreign Secretary Eden to comment on Sino-British relations. Eden stated, "I can gladly report that the relationship between the Chinese and British governments remains harmonious, cooperative, and exceptionally close. As we are engaged in a struggle for survival against aggression in Europe and the Middle East, the British people naturally sympathize with China's efforts to resist foreign domination and maintain its independence." (Applause from the floor.) The British government has done its utmost to help China maintain its independence in the past and will continue to do so in the future. (Applause from the floor.) (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden responded to a Member of Parliament's questions about Japan in the House of Commons yesterday, and his response was met with sustained applause. The Member pointed out that Eden's tone indicated Britain's determination to adopt a much-needed policy toward Japan. Numerous Members questioned Japan's failure to fulfill its promises and its continued exclusion of other countries' trade in occupied areas of China. Eden replied that the Japanese side has repeatedly violated its guarantees and rejected British interests in China, and the Japanese government cannot escape responsibility. He has said this before. Britain has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese government, but the results have been unsatisfactory. He has now instructed the British Ambassador to Japan to respond to Japan's criticisms of economic restrictions within British territory, stating that the primary purpose of British restrictions is to maintain supplies for its own use and prevent them from falling into enemy hands. However, Britain's economic policy will naturally be influenced by the Japanese government's attitude toward British interests in China. Conservative MP Milner raised the point that the House of Commons would undoubtedly be pleased with the Foreign Secretary's statement and requested the Foreign Secretary to provide assurance that this policy would be pursued with determination. Eden replied that the policy would be pursued with determination. The Japanese government criticizes Britain's economic policy, but if Japan does not treat British interests in China with appropriate consideration, it cannot expect to gain any benefits in this regard. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - All the newspapers here have prominently featured, in large characters, British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons, stating that Britain will continue to aid China's struggle for independence with all its strength. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Conservative MP Hannah recently asked in the House of Commons what actions Foreign Secretary Eden has taken regarding the actions of the chairman of the anti-British association in Beijing, who threatened to punish anyone openly selling British goods. Eden replied that he has instructed local British officials to prepare a report, and then he will consider what action is appropriate. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the United States will undertake urgent diplomatic action regarding the Far East and Europe.</p>
<h3>Hull Receives Soviet Ambassador</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky, who have not met for discussions for over a year, are scheduled to meet today. Therefore, it is widely believed that the currently uncertain US-Soviet relations will soon become clearer. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull is scheduled to meet with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky within the next few days for discussions. It is anticipated that various outstanding issues between the United States and the Soviet Union will be resolved. After the United States government restricted the shipment of certain goods to the Soviet Union, the quantity of goods purchased by the Soviet Union from the United States decreased sharply, almost to zero. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Reliable Congressional sources stated yesterday that the United States' dispatch of a squadron of Flying Fortresses to Hawaii, and other recent developments, are generally believed to be based on the United States' preparation for urgent diplomatic actions in the Far East and Europe. It was further stated that a state of full readiness is evident here. All major administrative leaders remain silent amidst the most critical circumstances of the war. Sources familiar with the matter also believe that President Roosevelt's cancellation of his scheduled speech at the Pan-American Congress and his press conference at the White House, as well as the cancellation of press conferences by other cabinet members in the past few days, are evidence of the United States' preparation for drastic action. Congressional sources stated that the last declaration by an administrative leader was Secretary of the Navy Knox's speech, in which Knox declared that the United States was on standby. The dispatch of airplanes to Hawaii and the refusal to release information about the movement of warships and airplanes are all of great significance. One expert believes that the administration may be trying to prevent Japan from taking certain actions. To cope with this, the United States must keep its forces focused on the Far East. The expert also cited the administration's recommendation to close loopholes in the Philippines to prevent raw materials from being shipped to unfriendly countries, as well as other strong stances toward the Far East in the past fourteen days. Congressional sources stated that the main stage for diplomatic action seems to be in Europe, and the administration is considering certain actions regarding the issue of supplying American goods to Britain. However, the most reliable sources do not believe that the United States will announce that it will use warships to escort and protect the shipment of military supplies to Britain.

<p>Italian Newspaper Claims that if the US Joins the European War, Japan will Immediately Wage War Against the Democratic Nations</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Premier Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, declared in the Italian Daily Newspaper today that if the United States participates in the current European war, Japan will naturally declare war on the Western democracies. Gayda forcefully argued that Japan's interests lie with the Axis powers in resisting the Anglo-Saxon group and stated that those in North America who incite war pay attention to Europe but neglect Asia, and therefore deliberately ignore the fact that if the United States fights the Axis powers, the war will inevitably expand. Gayda's article stated that the United States, in whatever way it participates in the war, will turn the war into a war between Europe and the Americas. From "the near future," additional [forces] will continue to be dispatched to Hawaii. He also stated that the Army has been continuously strengthening the defenses of Hawaii with new-style fighter jets and twin-engine bombers over the past few months. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Honolulu - The United States Army in Hawaii yesterday officially confirmed Washington's announcement that a "Flying Fortress" bomber group of twenty-one planes had flown to Hawaii. Army authorities declared that the bombers had completed the most extensive group flight in military aviation history, carrying officers and sergeants, totaling one hundred and ninety people. At the same time, authorities announced that they hope that in the near future the Hawaiian Air Force will receive more material reinforcements. Officials also confirmed Washington's announcement that the Hawaiian military had recently increased its strength by a large number of new-style pursuit planes and light bomber aircraft, thus greatly enhancing their material strength.

<h3>US Ambassador to Britain Delivers Speech, Saying the Fate of Democratic Nations Depends on the Good Use of Naval Power</h3>
<p>London - US Ambassador to Britain Winant recently gave a speech at the English Association, in which he said, "The fate of a free people depends on how well they use their naval power. We are in the midst of the greatest war in history. For the sake of protecting freedom in the modern world, democratic nations have shown the world that if they want to retain the right to speak, they must have the power to act." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Thai Newspaper Dissatisfied with Japan's Malicious Propaganda</h3>
<p>Bangkok - A Thai daily newspaper editorial expressed extreme dissatisfaction with Tokyo's wireless propaganda methods, stating that if Tokyo continues to spread propaganda unfavorable to Thailand, it will inevitably cause disputes between Japan and Thailand, eventually leading to a crisis in Asia. The newspaper recounted Tokyo wireless's unintentional inflammatory propaganda and expressed dissatisfaction with the broadcast that overseas Chinese are now leaving Thailand and returning to Nanjing, which is controlled by Japan. The newspaper concluded that Japan has leaped to become the strongest country in Asia, and Thailand respects it because of its leadership position, but this should not be interpreted as other countries being subservient to Tokyo.

<h3>Twenty-One US Flying Fortresses Complete Collective Flight; the Route is Between San Francisco and Hawaii; the Purpose is to Consolidate the Defense of the Island</h3>
<p>Washington - The War Department stated yesterday that twenty-one "Flying Fortress" bombers had completed a collective flight from San Francisco to Hawaii to consolidate the defense of the island. A War Department announcement stated that the bombers, led by Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Emmons, took off at 9:25 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on Tuesday and safely landed at Hickam Field on Oahu Island at 11:28 AM (Eastern Standard Time) yesterday. These planes are the latest model of 21-ton Boeing long-range bombers, designated as BA-17, and are heavily equipped with armament and armor plating. The War Department also stated that many medium-range bombers and Flying Fortresses capable of continuing to fly 1,800 miles over water had caused the addition of other continents. Gayda said that Japan is now paying attention to the evolution of the European war and the relationship between the United States and the war, as much as it pays attention to China and Asia. Japan knows that the hostility of Anglo-Saxon imperialists towards Japan is far greater than their hostility towards the Axis powers. Japan also knows that if the Anglo-Saxons defeat the Axis powers in Europe, they will destroy what Japan has gained in China and eliminate Japan from Asia. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Military Delegation Inspects Malayan Defenses; More British Troops Arrive in Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore - The Chinese military delegation currently visiting Malaya has traveled extensively from Thailand in the north to Singapore in the south. It is said that they were most impressed by Malaya's defenses, particularly its anti-aircraft gun emplacements. They were also favorably impressed by the close cooperation of British, Indian, Australian, and Malayan native troops. During their tour of the northern region, the delegation spent a considerable amount of time with Indian and Australian troops and discussed various defensive matters with Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Singapore - Military authorities have announced that the defenses of Malaya were further strengthened yesterday by the arrival of a large number of British troops. The British troops, including army, air force, and naval personnel, arrived yesterday afternoon and were in high spirits and good health despite the long journey. The communique added that the army personnel included infantry, artillery, and service corps. This deployment is part of Britain's policy of strengthening Malaya's defenses. The landing of the new troops was facilitated by several US transport ships, which are currently unloading military supplies shipped from the US under the Lend-Lease Act. Another group watching the landing of the British troops was the Chinese military delegation led by General Shang Zhen, who arrived on May 10th to observe the overall defenses. The delegation said that Malaya's defensive strength was excellent, and that the troops from various parts of the British Empire were cooperating very well. During their visit to Kuala Lumpur, the leaders of the delegation also had discussions with Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces in Malaya. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>What Britain Can Do Now</h3>
<p>"What should Britain do for China now?" This question has indeed been circulating among many upright British people recently. They hope to obtain a reassuring and satisfactory answer. Britain has long had enlightened individuals, and now, at least with regard to China and the Far East, the enlightened are in the majority. In the past, the roots of the disaster in the Far East, the value and impact of China's resistance, and Britain's responsibilities and relationships in this matter were not well understood by the majority of the British people. They thought that Britain had its own way, its own way of not suffering losses. This illusion, speaking from today, is completely gone. Now, most British people, who are indeed upright, can understand things more thoroughly. They recognize that Britain winning in Europe while China loses in Asia, or Britain losing in Europe while China wins in Asia, is absolutely unacceptable and impossible. Only if both China and Britain win, only if China and Britain win completely, can the international situation be stabilized and the world's problems be solved. Otherwise, one defeat means two defeats, and China, Britain, and even the world and the international community will be completely defeated and finished. Of course, only the enlightened can recognize this, and only the upright are willing to admit it. After recognizing and admitting this, they must recall the past. Thus, the enlightened and upright, while not ignoring the difficulties of the present, all have a sense of "regret for not acting sooner," believing that if aggression had been stopped in the beginning, would the problem be as difficult as it is today? The past is past, complaining is useless, and regret is too late, so they ask about the present.</p>
<p>Now, China is resolutely upholding its spirit of the past four years, continuing to fight, having suffered many losses and made enormous sacrifices. Although the day of final victory is getting closer, the difficulties and hardships are deepening. All kinds of construction are sprouting and thriving, but they are behind schedule. Military equipment is crude and simple, and only hoping for gradual self-sufficiency is insufficient. Therefore, they look forward to foreign aid like rain during a severe drought. If a certain country is only sympathetic to China, then how to help is a matter of doing their best and acting according to their capabilities. Britain, from any angle, any aspect, any meaning, and any position, has the necessity of doing everything possible to provide effective aid to China with all its strength. Unfortunately, the greatest possible opportunity for Britain to aid China has passed. Britain calls itself the hegemon of the seas, but from the North Sea to the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, it is being provoked and spied upon by powerful enemies everywhere. Although the situation is not critical, it is serious. Although the future is not bleak, it is distant. They must devote all their efforts and concentrate all their attention. Therefore, the reasons for aiding China remain, the necessity remains, but the possibilities for aiding China have drastically decreased and are decreasing further due to the limitations of the situation. How can upright people not hesitate about what to do!</p>
<p>On land, there are tanks that can crush strong defenses, and cannons that can defeat the enemy. In the air, there are defensive fighter planes and offensive bombers. On the sea, there are anti-blockade and counter-attack capabilities, with giant warships of all classes and various small boats. These are all things that Britain has and China needs. Expeditionary forces land in Norway and Greece. Naval and air forces attack Germany and Italy. These are all things that China admires and Britain excels at. If Britain, based on the reasons for aiding China and recognizing the necessity of aiding China, started from its Eastern territories and advanced further east, this would surely change the overall situation in the Far East. At that time, if the Chinese army were to conduct its work of sweeping and clearing within Chinese territory, the military effectiveness achieved would surely be remarkable and outstanding. Unfortunately, such an imagined scene has never existed in the past, and it is not necessarily so in the future, and it is impossible in the present. What is called a small possibility, although not absolute, should never be forced. Whatever is inappropriate or impossible is what China does not seek and what Britain does not do.</p>
<p>What China can seek and what Britain can do is the answer to "what to do?" Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Eden replied to questions from Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. According to London dispatches, those who heard it at the time responded with cheers. After receiving this dispatch, we would also like to respond with approval. Eden stated that Britain sympathizes with China's resistance to foreign domination and its efforts to maintain independence. He also stated that Britain has done its utmost to help China maintain independence in the past and will do so in the future. Furthermore, he said that Britain will resolutely pursue its policy of economic restrictions within its territory. This is what Britain can do. As for what China seeks, at present and in relation to Britain, it is by no means asking Britain to send any small portion of its land, sea, or air forces to participate in the Far Eastern war and help China fight. China only asks Britain to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and as strictly as possible what it can do, that is, to clearly distinguish the object, meaning, and scope of the so-called "enemy." In the economic aspect, not only should they "maintain supplies for its own use and prevent them from falling into enemy hands," but also, regarding military, commercial, and even agricultural and industrial goods, regardless of whether Britain has a surplus or not, regardless of whether Britain lacks them or not, absolutely not supply or accept even the slightest amount.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting in Southern Shanxi; Chinese Troops Firmly Defend Zhongtiao Mountain; Japanese Troops Retreat from the North Bank of the Yellow River; Chinese Troops in Guangdong Recapture Huaxian City</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman announced this afternoon while raising expectations for newspaper reporters that the eastern section of Zhongtiao Mountain in Southern Shanxi currently has . . . The outcome of this battle may determine whether the Japanese army will be able to completely control the north bank of the Yellow River. The Japanese army has concentrated six divisions and two mixed brigades to attack Southern Shanxi. However, so far only three divisions have actually participated in the battle. The Japanese army began its offensive on May 8th, with elite troops advancing from north to south, directly to Yuanqu on the north bank of the Yellow River, causing the Chinese troops defending Zhongtiao Mountain to be dispersed. The spokesman acknowledged that the Chinese troops defending the western section of Zhongtiao Mountain had been subjected to pressure from the Japanese army. However, the Chinese troops still hold the positions in the eastern section. According to the latest intelligence received by the Chinese military headquarters, the Japanese troops who had reached the north bank of the Yellow River have suddenly retreated north. The motive for this move cannot be determined. The Japanese army may have turned north and encircled the Chinese troops in the eastern section of Zhongtiao Mountain. Someone asked whether the Japanese army would cross the Yellow River and advance towards Luoyang or Xi'an. The spokesman replied that this development would depend on two things: (1) whether the Japanese army can eliminate the Chinese troops on Zhongtiao Mountain, and (2) whether the Japanese army can add three to five new divisions to participate in the offensive. The spokesman also said that no troops from the Eighteenth Group Army (Communist Army) are participating in the battle of Zhongtiao Mountain. It is said that some Japanese troops are carrying motorized boats, but to date there are no signs that the Japanese army intends to cross the Yellow River. Currently, in addition to a portion of the Japanese army holding Zhongtiao Mountain, there are also some troops stationed in Fengmengu (transliteration) on the north bank of the Yellow River, and there are strong forces attacking Yangbei, north of Zhongtiao Mountain. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese army in northern Hubei is currently attacking Suizhou, Zhongxiang, and Jingmen in several directions, with the aim of supporting the Japanese offensive in Southern Shanxi and eliminating the Chinese troops in the Dabie Mountains. The spokesman pointed out that the purpose of these Japanese troops in several directions is to prevent the Chinese troops in Henan province from crossing the river to aid the battle in Southern Shanxi. The Japanese army in northern Hubei is currently threatening Nanyang, an important town less than two of Luoyang. Although the current situation is still unclear, it can be said that the purpose of this offensive by the Japanese army is to end the war against China as soon as possible.

<h3>German Planes Land in Syria with Disguised Markings British Order Action and Inform US German Torpedo Boats also sail into Mediterranean via Marseille</h3>
<p>Cairo: Several German planes using disguised markings landed at three airfields in Syria. Their purpose is apparently to head to Iraq. According to travelers arriving here from Syria, a senior German official is currently in Beirut discussing matters with the Italian Armistice Commission and French authorities. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: Reliable sources announced this afternoon that the French authorities in Syria have now allowed Germans to use airfields there for flights to Iraq. Therefore, the British government has been granted full authority to deal with German planes at Syrian airfields. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Eden confirmed in the House of Commons this afternoon that Britain has ordered action against German planes at Syrian airfields. Eden accused the French government of violating the armistice conditions. Eden said he had notified the US government of this development. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: A Member of Parliament recently revealed in the House of Commons that German torpedo boats had entered the Mediterranean via France, stating that these boats had sailed along the Rhone River through France and entered the Mediterranean via Marseille. The British government had protested to Vichy about this. Foreign Secretary Eden, in his reply, did not acknowledge the truth of this statement but said he believed that protesting to Vichy was not the best course of action in this situation.

<h3>German Ships Gather on Lower Danube Threatening Soviet Union to Demand Concessions</h3>
<p>Ankara: German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, presented a friendly letter from Hitler to the Turkish President yesterday. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: The German News Agency reported that German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, met with the Turkish President for one hour on Wednesday afternoon. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu was also present. According to a Turkish official gazette, Franz von Papen paid a routine visit to the Turkish Foreign Minister after returning to his post yesterday. The Turkish Cabinet held its weekly meeting that day, and the Turkish Foreign Minister reported on foreign affairs at a non-public meeting of the People's Party, lasting one hour. The Turkish Prime Minister also reported on foreign developments. The meeting then adjourned amidst cheers. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Ankara: The main topic of discussion here is where Germany will act next. Most believe it will be in Syria. One newspaper commented, "Germany wants to invade Egypt via Syria. However, how the German army will enter Syria is Germany's business. In any case, Germany will not pass through Turkey; this is what we know for sure." Another newspaper carried an unconfirmed report that German bombers had arrived in Mosul, Iraq. According to many people, Hitler is currently trying to persuade Darlan to urge Pétain to allow German troop transport planes to land in Syria and then enter Iraq. It is said that 15 German divisions are currently stationed in Moldavia, more than the number stationed there before the start of the invasion of the Balkans. It is also known that Germany has concentrated a large number of flat-bottomed naval vessels on the lower Danube, indicating that Hitler intends to attack the Soviet Union or use it as a threat of invasion to demand concessions from Stalin. The Turkish government is calmly monitoring the situation and continuing to take defensive measures. Parliament has approved an additional national defense expenditure of £13 million in Turkish currency. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: Axis authorities here predicted yesterday that within two or three weeks, the Axis powers will take major actions to consolidate Europe, control the Near East, and deploy Axis forces in the South Atlantic to establish fortresses to prevent US interference. It is claimed that important diplomatic negotiations are underway to easily achieve the above three objectives. Because food and oil are essential for final victory, the Axis powers are now striving to obtain these two items from the Soviet Union, which is believed to be agreeable. However, if the Soviet Union obstructs them, the Axis powers are prepared to use "the most drastic actions" against the Soviet Union to achieve their goals. The Axis powers are now completing their plan to attack the Suez Canal. Turkish, French, and German representatives are negotiating in Ankara to bring Turkey into closer cooperation with the "New Order." Another step is to attack Gibraltar. Even if this ancient British stronghold does not fall, its effect will be neutralized by the strengthening of the Axis base in the western Mediterranean. This step involves closer cooperation between the Axis powers and Spain. Franco-Spanish cooperation has already reached an understanding. Italy will gain control of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas and will modify its demands on French North Africa. The final stage of Axis action is to deploy forces in Dhaka and Casablanca in southwestern Spain to intercept US aid to Britain. (International News Service, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Elaborates on Situation in Iraq Air Force Controls Habbaniyah Port of Basra All Quiet</h3>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday elaborated on the recent situation in Iraq in the House of Commons, stating that the British Air Force detachment in Habbaniyah had repelled the Iraqi army's attack and now controlled the entire area around the town. The British Air Force detachment and British forces in Basra are rapidly reinforcing. The British Air Force is constantly attacking military targets throughout Iraq. The British government believes that the actions of Ali Gaylani and his associates in attacking loyal allies are not supported by the entire Iraqi population. The British government has no intention of threatening Iraqi independence. Its only wish is to guarantee its legitimate treaty rights. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Mumbai: The last batch of several hundred British women and children evacuated from Habbaniya, Iraq, has arrived safely here. According to reports, they were fired upon by Ali Gaylani's forces while being evacuated by plane from Habbaniyah to Basra amidst exploding bombs, shells, and the chatter of machine guns. A senior official of the British Colonial Office, who has been stationed in Iraq for many years, has arrived in India with his wife, stating that all is quiet in Basra and the provincial government is functioning as usual. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Amery Gives Speech Striving to Cope with Naval and Air Battles Seeking to Preserve Iraq's Independence</h3>
<p>London: Secretary of State for India Leo Amery, speaking in Coventry last night, first stated that the initial air battle over Britain last autumn had shattered Hitler's dream of swallowing up an unarmed British Empire. He then said that the second air battle over Britain and the submarine war in the Atlantic are currently underway. We must devote all our energy and skill to cope with it and persevere to the end, no matter how long it continues. Hitler is no closer to his goal of ambition against Britain than he was when he abandoned the first air battle over Britain six months ago. He went on to describe the situation in the Balkans, saying that the German campaign in the Balkans, which was unexpected and costly, may have disrupted Hitler's overall plan for a triumphant advance across Turkey. In the coming months, Germany will fully feel its impact on transportation and supply lines. He also mentioned the situation in Iraq, saying that a rather dangerous situation has developed in Iraq. We have forced Ali Gaylani and his followers to reveal their actions in the faint hope that the German side will provide timely assistance. The boil that was about to fester has been lanced. The actions we have taken do not have the intention of eliminating Iraqi independence, as our country and I, when I held office, did everything in our power to preserve Iraq's independence. All we seek is to fulfill our alliance obligations, which Iraq has voluntarily accepted as the only effective guarantee of its security. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Scorching Heat in North Africa Saw Battle in Western Desert German Troops Halted Before Reaching Egypt South African Air Force Deployed in Desert</h3>
<p>Cairo: The fighting in the Western Desert remains a battle of attrition. After the German attack on Sunday, the British forces took the initiative, sending motorized patrols to attack in the Sollum area and harass enemy columns around Tobruk. Military sources believe that the German attack is intended to temporarily prevent the activities of British armored patrols. The scorching heat in North Africa is increasing, making it difficult to conduct large-scale military operations. However, military sources are confident that whatever strategy the enemy adopts, they will be met with a heavy blow from the British forces. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent with a mobile patrol in the Western Desert reported that the German troops advancing into Egypt had been halted 40 miles long and 90 miles from the Egyptian border. Intelligence planes reported that one or two of the five German routes appeared to be retreating. Therefore, the German army may have abandoned its coastal advance and attempted to cross the desert south to cut off the Allied forces. It is not yet clear whether this German attack was a large-scale offensive or merely a fierce attack to probe the strength of the Allied forces and their positions. When the German attack began at dawn on Monday, it was stopped by the Allied forces' forward positions. As the German eight-wheeled armored vehicles and tanks advanced, raising clouds of dust, the Allied artillery batteries bombarded the areas where the dust rose, and the German advance came to a halt. When the German army tried to find a way to break through the Allied lines, British fighter planes suddenly swooped down and strafed them. The German army scattered in panic. The British planes continued to swoop down and attack the German army relentlessly throughout the day, only stopping when dusk fell in the desert and enemy vehicles could no longer be distinguished. The South African Air Force, transferred from Eritrea, fought in the Western Desert for the first time that day. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: It has just been learned from responsible sources here that the German Air Force went to the area south of Sollum on the 13th to assist the German army in its operations, bombing Allied concentrations and trucks. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Nairobi: According to a statement issued today, British forces continue to achieve victories on all fronts in Abyssinia. On Tuesday, British forces captured nine light tanks from the Italian army. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Twelve Soviet Speculators Executed</h3>
<p>Moscow: A Moscow Radio broadcast announced that twelve employees of the National Food Cooperative were sentenced to death yesterday for speculating in liquor and sugar, causing the Soviet Union to lose US$50 million. Twenty-five others were also sentenced to various terms of imprisonment for the same crime. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Advisor to British Economic Warfare Department Killed</h3>
<p>London: England, a diplomatic advisor to the British Economic Warfare Department, was killed while inspecting a fire station during an air raid at the age of 50. He went to Peiping as a counselor in 1929, served as chargé d'affaires in China from 1931 to 1934, and was then transferred to Italy as chargé d'affaires. In 1939, he joined the Economic Warfare Department. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>European Nations Will Not Tolerate Rule The World's Future Hope Depends on British-American Understanding</h3>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech here yesterday that Europe will never tolerate one ruling nation and others as subject nations. The Nazis are now fighting against history and natural forces and trying to reverse the trend of the world. Therefore, there are signs of division among the small group of parties who seek to extend their rule by force. The fact that Hess, who shook the world, landed in Britain with an umbrella can at least provide some explanation. The greatest hope for the future of the world lies in British-American understanding. We have the same traditions and habits. What does it mean when we say that we are willing to endure any hardship that German military forces can inflict, but we will never abandon our beliefs? I think the world can understand it. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Naval and Air Battles in Western Mediterranean German and Italian Planes Attack British Convoy Battles for Eight Hours Without Success</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent with the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported from the HMS Ark Royal that while escorting a convoy in the Western Mediterranean last week, enemy planes attacked, leading to eight hours of fierce fighting with British fighters and British warships' guns. The enemy planes were unsuccessful and fled. Then, the Italian broadcaster shamelessly boasted that several British planes had been shot down and that three British warships had been severely damaged, which is laughable. In fact, Italian bombers, protected by a large number of fighters and assisted by German planes, attacked in favorable weather, but no bombs fell near the British warships, let alone hit them. Instead, they were heavily bombarded by British fighters and British ships' guns, losing seven and severely damaging five. On that day, enemy planes constantly threatened and launched four attacks in total, with torpedo bombers and high-flying bombers attacking twice each. British warships' fighters were on alert all day, flying into the low-lying clouds at any time to attack the enemy bomber formations. At that time, the British fleet was sailing between the Cagliari naval base and Sicily, so the Italian side was able to send many formations of well-equipped, fast-flying land-based fighters to protect the Italian bombers. The British ships' guns roared together continuously throughout the day, with flashes of gunfire and black smoke everywhere. The British fighters also tumbled in the clouds, attacking the enemy bombers. It was often seen that columns of water rose high on the horizon far around the British ships, as the enemy bombers, although protected, were heavily attacked by British fighters and fled in panic into the sea. The British fighters fought bravely against a large number of enemies, repeatedly dispersing enemy bombers hiding in the clouds, waiting for an opportunity to swoop down and drop bombs. At dusk, enemy torpedo bombers launched a final attack, while 30 German dive bombers, covered by six fighters, circled in the clouds, apparently planning to attack at the same time. Six British fighters happened to rush in, sweeping with machine guns, and immediately saw a German plane catch fire and fall into the sea. Two enemy fighters, staggering and smoking, fled into the clouds. The remaining enemy planes surrounded and attacked the small formation of British planes, but they bravely fought back. The enemy planes finally dropped their bombs into the sea and fled. Although the British planes were riddled with bullets, they still flew back in triumph. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Laval Actively Collaborates with Germany: The US is About to Take Strong Measures. The German Foreign Minister Plans to Visit Paris to Announce the Franco-German Declaration. It is Rumored that Hitler Proposed Returning Paris to Vichy.</h3>
<p>Washington - It was learned here yesterday that if Vichy actively cooperates with Germany, it will inevitably receive strong countermeasures from the United States. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull, at a reception for reporters, withheld criticism of the rumors that Vichy had approved the Hitler-Darlan agreement. However, another official said, "We still do not know its effect," meaning that the State Department does not yet know the details of the agreement. Officials here yesterday declined to comment on how this matter would affect the US food supply to France. However, newspapers said that German-French relations were a matter of great official concern. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden, speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, referred to the recent Franco-German agreement on lifting border restrictions and reducing occupation costs, saying that no official announcement had been made regarding what actions France would take to reciprocate Germany's so-called concessions. However, the Vichy government pointed to this agreement as a new progress towards Franco-German cooperation. Regardless of what concessions French Foreign Minister Darlan makes, he believes that although the French people are unable to prevent the Germans from systematically exploiting their resources, they may not be willing to sacrifice their noble traditions and customs and actively work for Germany of their own accord, thus prolonging their suffering and preventing their liberation. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The Italian news agency dispatch from Vichy said that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon visit Paris in person to announce the Franco-German declaration on France's accession to the "New Europe." According to sources here, a communiqué on Franco-German cooperation may be issued in Berlin today. According to Vichy news yesterday, it was rumored that General Pétain and his cabinet had accepted the conditions recently proposed by Hitler during his talks with Darlan. Although the exact content has not been released, it is said that the German demands are actually greater than what they are prepared to give. News from Vichy and other sources all indicate that the Germans may return the administrative power of Paris to the French government and release 25 French prisoners of war. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - A correspondent for the Daily Mail on the French border cabled that many believe Hitler has proposed returning Paris to the Vichy government as an exchange condition for close cooperation between the two countries. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Darlan May Visit Paris Again</p>
<p>Taecheng - Swiss radio said that well-informed sources in Vichy believe that the scope of Franco-German discussions is quite broad, not limited to purely economic matters. The final stage has not yet been reached. The negotiations involve France's position in the new Europe under German and Italian control. It is reported that the armistice terms will be revised, and the new demarcation line between the occupied and unoccupied zones will also be re-surveyed. There is still no definitive information on French concessions to Germany, but it is known that the German focus seems to be on opposing the creation of an Anglo-Saxon industrial group by the European industrial group, while allowing the French metallurgical and mining industries to occupy an important part in this group. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Swiss radio broadcasted a Vichy report stating that Hitler recently met with Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan in Berchtesgaden. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Keitel were also present. Darlan, accompanied by the Nazi Ambassador to Paris, Abetz, and Mr. Fontaine of the French Ministry of Aviation, arrived in Berchtesgaden from Paris by special train. Unofficial sources in Vichy claim that Darlan will soon go to Paris again to meet with "key German officials" in order to implement the agreements that have been agreed upon in principle.

<p>The French Cabinet's Decision Will Be Announced Within Days</p>
<p>Vichy - The Cabinet discussed the various French and German issues this morning, and a decision will be announced soon, generally including the following: (1) Reducing the Franco-German burden of German troops stationed in France; (2) Redrawing the demarcation line between the French occupied zone and the free zone; (3) Releasing a portion of French prisoners of war. Darlan has prepared a report on his talks with the German authorities, which will be submitted to the government for approval. He will then go to the French occupied zone to continue talks with the German authorities. It is said that he may directly meet with the German Foreign Minister, but it is difficult to say for sure. Diplomatic observers say that the various proposals were unanimously approved at this morning's cabinet meeting. The previous rumors that the French cabinet would be reorganized after the Franco-German talks seem unlikely to become reality. According to well-informed sources, although the various resolutions passed by the cabinet meeting are practical, they are not extremely important. The main purpose of this Franco-German talks is to determine to what extent France views the European continent as the center of the situation. Both sides were very sincere during this negotiation, and the various rumors about this matter should not be believed. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Authoritative sources said yesterday that the authorities may issue an official communiqué on the Franco-German talks today. German newspapers and officials are keeping silent on the matter. However, authoritative sources expressed satisfaction with the German-Soviet economic talks, which ended on Monday.

There were many touching scenes at the meeting, and people shouted "Long live France, long live Australia." (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Churchill to Release Report on Hess's Flight to England. He is Now Being Treated as a Wounded Prisoner of War. Visitors Must Be Inspected by Police Officers.</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill will release a report on Hess's flight to England. Observers say that the Prime Minister may warn the people not to place excessive emotions on this matter, which is also very likely. It is now known that Hess met with the Duke after landing on the Duke of Hamilton's estate. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - According to what is known today, Hitler's representative Hess met with the Duke of Hamilton within 48 hours of arriving in Scotland. A report was sent to London afterwards. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - It is now known that German Deputy Führer Hess flew to Scotland to meet with the Duke of Hamilton. He landed only a few miles from the Duke of Hamilton's residence. A statement issued by the German side said that, judging from the documents left by Hess, Hess wanted to meet with the Duke of Hamilton in order to establish peace between England and Germany. It was found that Hess had tried to write to the Duke a few months ago, but the Duke immediately forwarded the letter to the British authorities without replying. Before the war, the Duke had met Hess once or twice due to sports events, as both of them were interested in sports. The map left by Hess, with the route from Augsburg to Scotland marked in blue pencil, ended at Dungavel, where the Duke of Hamilton's residence is located. After landing on Saturday night, Hess asked the farmer McLennan for directions to Dungavel. Hess mistook a huge house for the Duke of Hamilton's residence. Seeing that there was no suitable place to land, he jumped out with an umbrella. Although he injured his ankle, he wanted someone to lead him to the Duke's residence, as he thought the Duke's residence was nearby. According to German news agency reports, Hess had met Hamilton at the 1936 World Games. After Hess landed, he told the villagers about the hardships he felt in Germany and the</p>
<p>Decline of Popular Morale</p>
<p>Caused by the British Air Force's Bombing. He also spoke of the suffering of German civilians. It is said that Hess also said that he had spent a lot of effort making preparations for his escape. He brought with him very important documents for the Duke of Hamilton, as well as information that was very beneficial to Britain and could help it overthrow the German tyranny. It is expected that British Prime Minister Churchill will not meet Hess. The British side now treats him as a wounded prisoner of war. Kirkpatrick, a special envoy from the Foreign Office who went to see Hess, has not yet returned to London. It is expected that Churchill will soon be able to continue to make statements on this matter in the House of Commons. It is said that Hess contributed a lot to Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." There are two main points in the book: one is not to fight against Britain, and the other is to oppose communism. Now that Hitler has violated this doctrine and started a war against Britain and formed an alliance with the Soviet Union, Hess adheres to the doctrine that others cannot match. As a result, he was greatly disappointed and had to</p>
<p>Escape Into Europe's</p>
<p>Only Safe Country. It is said that Hess left a letter blaming Hitler for breaking his principles. As for Hess's arrival in England indicating that Germany is now in its final struggle, it is not very convincing. Hess came here perhaps because he did not agree with the German war government and believed that he could propose peace terms between the two countries. However, it can be said with certainty that Britain is determined to fight to the end until it wins, and even if Hess makes this proposal, it will not have any impact in Britain. According to a Berlin dispatch from the Basler Zeitung, Berlin officials admitted that there were absolutely no signs of mental disorder in the letter left by Hess. However, they warned the people not to believe the news about Hess from Britain, saying that Britain would use this matter for propaganda purposes, and that the remarks made by Hess that Britain had conveyed were made under duress. Yesterday, the Scottish police specially dispatched police officers to inspect those entering the hospital to visit Hess. Military police were stationed at the hospital entrance, and no one was allowed to enter without special permission. Many filmmakers surrounded the Scottish farmer McLennan, asking him to perform</p>
<p>Hess's Arrest</p>
<p>The circumstances at the time. McLennan declined, saying, "I don't want to be a movie star. I don't have time for this." The filmmakers then told him to come back later. McLennan replied, "The work of a farmer is never finished, so it is impossible to come back later." Then, because the filmmakers continued to pester him, he said, "You might as well take pictures of me while I'm farming." After finishing the matter, McLennan said to the photographers, "You guys came here to make me stop working, which is more troublesome than those Germans." (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Saving Movement Promoted in Mongolia, Tibet and Border Provinces. Although Started Later, Achievements are Good. People in Guerrilla Areas Eagerly Purchase Bonds.</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Recently, the total amount of savings in the country has increased to 300 million yuan. In order to make all parties understand the widespread promotion situation, the Savings Promotion Association specially released information on the promotion of savings in Mongolia, Tibet, border provinces, and guerrilla areas as follows. The Mongolian and Tibetan regions are located on the borders and were mobilized later. However, their enthusiasm for responding to the savings movement is commendable. In Lhasa, the central government of Tibet, and Yulin, the southern part of Inner Mongolia, Mongolian and Tibetan people are enthusiastically purchasing savings bonds. According to the report of the Savings Group of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission at the end of last December, the amount was 120,000 yuan. It is estimated that it has recently multiplied. In addition, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xikang provinces have established savings and transportation agencies early on. The counties of Suiyuan Province that have not been invaded are promoted by members sent by the Shaanxi Savings Promotion Branch. Under the principle that the provincial savings group accounts for 60% and the promotion accounts for 40%, more than 130,000 yuan has been collected. In Shanxi, a guerrilla province, Japanese soldiers have invaded and there is almost no safe land. The provincial savings group operates in difficult circumstances and has also accumulated 200,000 yuan in savings. Most guerrilla areas in various provinces have established savings promotion branches. Yueyang in Hunan belongs to the Japanese guerrilla area and is also promoted by the Xiang Savings Group. Although these numbers are not very large, they are sufficient to reflect the widespread promotion of savings and the enthusiasm of the participants, which is of great significance.

<h3>Chongqing Press Celebrates Ta Kung Pao Winning US Medal</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Ta Kung Pao won the medal from the Missouri School of Journalism in the United States. The Chinese Journalism Association and the Chongqing Newspapers Joint Committee held a tea party at the Central Party Headquarters at 4 pm on the 15th to celebrate. Colleagues from all over the country sent congratulatory telegrams. Presidents Dai and Yu both wrote congratulatory messages.

<h3>The United Kingdom and the United States Plan to Send Experts to China</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to reports, in addition to providing material assistance to China, the United Kingdom and the United States also plan to send many experts to China. The Chinese government is currently preparing dormitories for the experts in various transportation centers. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>New York - According to reliable sources, several American ships, carrying military supplies and weapons to support the British Middle East Army, are en route. They are preparing to paint the American flag clearly on the decks and sides of the ships and hoist high lights before sailing into the Red Sea. So far, no American ships have sailed into the Red Sea. The first ship is about to sail in. (Note: German leader Hitler announced yesterday that the Red Sea has been designated as a war zone.) (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Neutral observers here recently warned the United States that if American ships sail in the Red Sea, they will immediately become targets of assassination by German aircraft. It is expected that there will be more German aircraft activity in this non-area. The observers also pointed out that German aircraft groups fiercely attacked British troops in the Solun area yesterday. They also recalled that German bombers had attacked Alexandria and Suez, and may immediately step up their attacks in these areas. The neutral observers also believe that Germany's declaration of the Red Sea as a war zone is very important. They also pointed out that if the United States, as Washington has reported, ignores German warnings and sails in the Red Sea, then American ships will immediately become targets of attack by German aircraft in Africa and Greece. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull, when receiving journalists today, refused to make any criticism of Germany's declaration of the Red Sea as a war zone and the extension of the blockade line to the Red Sea. As for the rumors that Germany has decided to set up a counter-blockade line on the sea near Danish Greenland, Hull also said that the State Department has not received formal notification from Germany, and even if it does, the government will refuse to recognize it. The Pan-American Conference has already decided that no third country should be allowed to establish a war zone in the Western Hemisphere. In short, both countries will not recognize the new war zone declared by Germany. According to well-informed sources, President Roosevelt had previously announced that the Red Sea would no longer be listed as a war zone, allowing American ships to sail there. At this time, there is no intention to change the above decision. American ships will continue to carry aid to Britain through the Red Sea, because 75% of British merchant ships that have had accidents are the result of the activities of German submarines and raiders. However, there is no such threat in the Red Sea. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Idle Talk of the European War (5) (6): A Record of the Great Fire of London</h3>
<p>London experienced a great fire in 1666, which burned for seven days and seven nights. On December 29, 1940, a large number of German aircraft raided London at night, causing another great fire. The following is a translation of the special dispatches from "The New York Times" and "Reader's Digest":</p>
<p>Britain now has a new defense line, and that is on the rooftops of the entire country. The enemy being defended against is "fire." In the middle of the night, alarms blared, and the incendiary bombs and small bombs dropped by the first batch of enemy aircraft burst into flames on various buildings. If they are not extinguished immediately, then a single spark can start a prairie fire, inevitably leading to a major disaster, and the blazing fire will allow bombers carrying powerful explosives to see their targets clearly. Kang Wenjie Laicheng has already suffered a painful lesson once.</p>
<p>Fire prevention lookout teams have now been organized throughout Britain, specializing in managing rooftops and extinguishing incendiary bombs dropped by enemy aircraft to prevent the spread of fire. If properly equipped and acting quickly, it can be quickly successful in eliminating a burning bomb. The problem is that someone should be on watch in every house, and this point has been resolved by special organizations in commercial and residential areas.</p>
<p>In large stores, employers can order employees to take turns guarding at night, paying attention to the falling of incendiary bombs. Each employee performs this obligation for no more than 48 hours per month. Small shops can take a mutual defense system, with employees from each shop taking responsibility for guarding. Rooftop guards in large apartments and hotels are not only employed but can also be recruited from guests. Fire prevention lookouts in large stores are compulsory, because in large-scale air raids, unmanned places at night often turn into scorched earth, and neighboring houses are also affected.</p>
<p>As for residential areas, because most houses are occupied during the most dangerous bombing times, fire prevention lookouts are purely voluntary, and people volunteer. Housewives are always prepared to use fire extinguishers and sand to defend against incendiary bombs. Neighbors often form patrols to resist the threat of fire from the sky.</p>
<p>On the night when German aircraft attempted to burn down London, which was last year's December 29th night, the reporter and Miss Magley watched Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" movie together. Magley is 25 years old, with a beautiful appearance. She is a half-English, half-French girl who can speak both English and French. She often works for the Paris Morning News. She escaped from Paris only one step ahead of the German army, then ran to London, and is still working as a female reporter.</p>
<p>The movie started at 4:30, and just as the fourth reel started, we suddenly heard the air raid siren blaring. A notice appeared on the screen stating that viewers who wanted to leave could leave and hide in the air raid shelter, but no one left. Fifteen minutes later, we felt that the entire box was shaking back and forth, presumably because a large bomb had fallen nearby, causing the vibration. Although none of us said anything, we knew that the situation outside the theater must be very tense.</p>
<p>At 7 o'clock, when the movie was over, we left the theater and felt that the situation in the city was unprecedented. London seemed to have turned into Rome as shown in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross" colorful film. The sky was a red light, mixed with clusters of orange flames. Although it was already dusk, it was as bright as day, and the thick lip gloss on Miss Magley's lips was clearly visible.</p>
<p>We were going to have dinner, but Magley first wanted to go to the newspaper office to proofread a news draft she had written in the afternoon. There was no one in the entire office. Finally, we found that all the office staff were in the basement, accompanied by the machine's roll of paper. They were proofreading. That house was not very sturdy, so they all ran into the basement and only came out after the falling bombs were scarce. Magley finished proofreading the new draft, and we set off together to look for restaurants that had not closed.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the street mostly looked flustered. When they heard the whistling sound of bombs nearby, they ran away. However, Magley did not want to run with the crowd. The red light in Cecil B. DeMille's film shone on everything. You could see everyone's face and see who was frightened and what their expression was when they were frightened, but there were really few people who were not flustered. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>US Ambassador Left Shanghai for Hong Kong Yesterday: Rumor of Important Meeting. Only Ambassador Johnson and Several Others Attended. General Review of Aid to China Policy.</h3>
<p>The new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge liner at about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. After staying here overnight, he took the original liner to Hong Kong at 11:30 a.m. yesterday morning to transfer to Chongqing to take office. The new Counselor of the US Embassy, Mr. Butlerick, accompanied him. Earlier, at about 10:00 a.m., the Ambassador and the Counselor drove from the Hwa Yuan Hotel to the New Customs Wharf to wait for the ferry to cross the large liner. US Consul General Lockhart, the US Yangtze River Fleet and Fourth Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, Colonel Bay, US Overseas Association President Dr. Mindstedt, US Chamber of Commerce President Nichols, and US China Judicial Office Judge Halmik all went to see him off. Gauss shook hands with the well-wishers one by one and then boarded the ferry. At 10:30, the whistle sounded long and they said goodbye to each other. The President Coolidge sailed out of the port at 11:30 a.m. yesterday morning and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow morning. The Ambassador may stay in Hong Kong for a while before flying with Counselor Butt to Chongqing to take office.</p>
<p>Rumor in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Call a Meeting</p>
<p>It is also learned that Ambassador Gauss's trip to Hong Kong via Shanghai and then to Chongqing to take office will involve a considerable stay in Hong Kong to convene an important meeting of senior US Far East officials. Among those attending will be Dr. Johnson, the former US Ambassador to China, who arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing the day before yesterday. Mr. Weimer, Second Secretary of the US Embassy, and Naval Attaché McHughes accompanied Mr. Johnson to Hong Kong. Also, the Commander of the US Army Air Corps in the Philippines, Claggett, flew to Hong Kong from the Philippines the day before yesterday. Therefore, it is generally believed that once Ambassador Gauss and Counselor Butt arrive in Hong Kong, a historic military and diplomatic meeting will be held in Hong Kong. If Gauss's ambassadorship is a symbol of the United States' intensification of aid to China, then this meeting can be said to be the forerunner in the overall decision of the actual aid to China. All parties highly estimate the importance of this meeting. Although Mr. Gauss denied the rumor that the five countries of China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Australia, and Burma would hold a military meeting in Singapore when he passed through Shanghai, the importance of the Hong Kong meeting is even greater than the rumored "Singapore meeting".</p>
<p>Naval Attaché</p>
<p>Also Traveled Together Yesterday</p>
<p>In addition to Counselor Butlerick, Naval Attaché Commander Crayton and Assistant Naval Attaché Lieutenant Williams also accompanied Ambassador Gauss to Hong Kong yesterday. Although Mr. Krewer's destination is Manila, he will participate in a meeting of important officials when passing through Hong Kong. Therefore, it is estimated that at least eight people will participate in the meeting: Gauss, Johnson, Butlerick, Crayton, Williams, Weimer, McHughes, and Claggett. It is not yet known whether British officials will send personnel to participate, but in any case, US officials in Hong Kong will definitely attend the meeting to discuss the issue. It is generally believed that this summit meeting will not only discuss the most effective methods of assisting China but will also thoroughly consider and decide on the situation in the South Pacific to cope with the new situation in the Far East after the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact. Ambassador Gauss will fly to Chongqing after the meeting and must take office by the end of the month at the latest. Johnson will wait for an opportunity to fly to the United States and then go to Australia to take office after consulting with the Vice President. =</p>
<p>Ambassador Johnson</p>
<p>Praises the New Appointee</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (United Press) - Retiring US Ambassador to China Johnson praised the new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, today. Johnson told visitors, "Gauss is truly the most qualified person I know to succeed me in my mission." Johnson expressed regret at leaving China and said that China is his second hometown. He said, "I am married here, my children were also born here, and I have many friends here. Under the circumstances, I feel as if I am severing the closest ties."</p>
<h3>Responding to Ambassador Coore's Call: British Nationals in Shanghai Enthusiastically Enlisting</h3>
<p>Many to Depart from Shanghai Next Week</p>
<p>Following the announcement by His Majesty's Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, urging British nationals in China to enlist and serve their country, a British official in Shanghai stated yesterday morning (the 15th) that a number of British residents in Shanghai are expected to depart within a few days to join the military. It is also anticipated that a large number of British nationals will soon join the ranks. It is reported that six British nationals will leave this week, and more are expected to depart next week, all enlisting in response to the Ambassador's call.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Budget Shortfall: Plan to Raise Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Reportedly Discussed by Japanese Newspaper</p>
<p>New Electricity Reduction Regulations Also Agreed Upon</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun", the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting at 4:30 PM on the 14th to discuss raising public bonds for the current year to offset the budget deficit, levying entertainment taxes, and actively implementing electricity reductions at the request of the Shanghai Power Company due to coal shortages. It was reported that although tax increases were implemented at the beginning of the year, the budget shortfall still reached a massive eight million yuan. To make up for this, it was decided to raise nine million yuan in public bonds. The interest rate terms and collateral will be formulated by the Municipal Council and announced later. Furthermore, it was decided to levy a surcharge of approximately 10% on admission tickets to entertainment venues such as cinemas and theaters within the Settlement. Finally, the meeting discussed the Shanghai Power Company's request to actively implement electricity reductions, recognizing the validity of the company's claims. It was decided to implement a 50% electricity reduction for various large consumers as originally proposed.</p>
<h3>Yu Fugeng Dies of Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Yu Fugeng, the Chinese Detective Chief Inspector and Acting Superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Police's old Detective Division, was shot and assassinated in front of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road at approximately 5 PM the day before yesterday. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Despite the best efforts of doctors from Renji Hospital and the Municipal Council Hospital, he succumbed to excessive blood loss and brain damage. Furthermore, due to Yu's advanced age, blood transfusions were ineffective. He passed away at 7:10 AM yesterday. Yu joined the Municipal Council on April 26, 1910, and rose through the ranks from Chinese Constable No. 399 to his current position, serving for 30 years. He was loyal to his duties and amiable. His unfortunate death has been widely mourned. Yu's remains have been sent to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road and will be encoffined on the 18th of this month. Senior Chinese and Western officials from the Police Department will attend the funeral.</p>
<h3>New Commander of US Marine Corps: Howard Takes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Troop Inspection Scheduled for Tomorrow Morning at the Racecourse</p>
<p>Baker to Reportedly Return to the US by Ship Next Week</p>
<p>Colonel Howard, the new commander of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the USS Chaumont the day before yesterday (the 14th). Yesterday (the 15th), he succeeded Colonel Baker as commander of the regiment. No ceremony was held during the handover. Howard will conduct his first inspection of the US Fourth Marine Regiment on Saturday morning (tomorrow). The entire regiment of American soldiers will be fully armed and will drill at the racecourse polo field, receiving inspection from the new and outgoing commanders. The American Community Federation, the American Chamber of Commerce, and US military officers are scheduled to host banquets for both Howard and Baker next Monday and Tuesday, welcoming the new commander and bidding farewell to the old. The official announcement of Baker's departure date has not yet been made, but it is reported that he will leave Shanghai on the USS Chaumont on Wednesday. Baker has been in Shanghai for over a year and has a wide circle of acquaintances. It is expected that government officials and civilians of various countries who know Baker will go to the pier to see him off. Baker came to Shanghai in February of last year to serve as the commander of the US military. He is known for his composure and decisiveness. Last summer, the US military arrested armed plainclothes Japanese personnel at the International Hotel. Baker's handling of the situation was appropriate and highly praised by all sectors of Shanghai and the United States. A New York dispatch referred to him as the "guardian of the foremost outpost of America in the Far East." Other American newspapers have also praised him.</p>
<h3>Bombing of Train Between Chang'an and Jianqiao Confirmed</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Japanese authorities announced today (the 15th) that a passenger train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line struck a landmine and exploded on Tuesday afternoon between Chang'an and Jianqiao. The engine and baggage car derailed. Several passengers were injured by shattered glass, but there were no fatalities. Traffic was restored to normal several hours later after the tracks were cleared. It is reported that the train was one of the new express trains recently introduced on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Several passenger cars were not directly affected by the explosion, allowing passengers to escape danger. However, the baggage car was completely destroyed. The work of clearing the wreckage was still in progress this morning. Japanese authorities stated that they are continuing to investigate the case and have found some electrical wires at the scene of the incident, which they believe were used to detonate the landmine.</p>
<h3>Warehouses Increase Storage Fees: Cracking Down on Hoarders</h3>
<p>Taigoo Wharf, Blue Funnel Wharf, Wheelock Wharf, Lung Mow &amp; Co., Kung Hoong Wharf, Shanghai Dock &amp; Warehouse Co., and other warehouses in Shanghai have increased their storage fees for goods starting yesterday (the 15th). The additional fee is 300% for the first month and 400% for the second month. The new prices will apply to all warehouse receipts, regardless of the date issued, until June 15th. The increased warehouse fees are an effective blow to unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods for speculative purposes.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in the Suburbs of Ningbo</h3>
<p>After Ningbo fell on the 20th of last month, looting occurred that evening due to bad elements. The Chen Sheng Wine Shop outside the West Gate suffered losses of over 200,000 yuan, and the Da Youfeng General Merchandise Store lost 700,000 yuan. A Mr. Xiang, from the Hunan business community, who conducted business in Ningbo under the Xiang Ji name, suffered losses of several million yuan, as he had a large amount of goods awaiting shipment in the Ningbo urban area, Hengxi, Shipu, and other places, all of which were looted. The Yongyao Electric Light Company, having reorganized earlier as a German company, did not evacuate and resumed lighting from the evening of the 21st. The Zhongma Bridge is intact and undamaged. The Xinjiang Bridge was hit by one shell, causing one row to collapse. When the Japanese troops entered the city, they used two Shandong-style wooden boats placed under the raft to repair it, which is now passable. No bombs fell inside the city. The rumor that a bomb hit the Drum Tower is not true.</p>
<h3>Port Rice Has Been Released from Warehouses</h3>
<p>Black Market at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Ordered to Shut Down</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's first batch of over 50,000 bags of subsidized Hong Kong rice has now been unloaded. The distributing procedures handled by the Leki &amp; Co. have issued payment and delivery notices to various rice shops, requiring them to pay the goods to the Cheung Mow &amp; Co. within three days, to get the warehouse receipts in order to release the goods. Therefore, various rice shops actively went to Cheung Mow &amp; Co. yesterday to settle the payment of goods. With these procedures completed, the delivery of goods will begin today, and sales can start tomorrow. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship has not yet arrived due to the bad weather yesterday, and should arrive today with Chap Holme Company's Fu Sheng ship.</p>
<p>Payment for Rice</p>
<p>Best to Prepare Banker's Drafts</p>
<p>According to reports from Ping Ming News, Cheung Mow &amp; Co. issued a total of over 10,000 bags yesterday, of which Thai Yu had over 6,000 bags, which were more than most. Many shops who tried to pay by cash and checks were refused. According to the person in charge of the Cheung Mow Co., the funds are directly transferred to the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), and HSBC does not accept checks. Cash also requires a handling fee of 15 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Therefore, for the various rice shops that go to pay for the goods, it is best to use a banker's draft from a bank or money shop. After the rice shops pay for the goods, in addition to receiving the bill of lading from Cheung Mow &amp; Co., the company will also issue a rectangular piece of thick cardboard, written in Chinese and English: "This store sells Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice, current market price of 110 yuan per picul", so that each rice shop can hang it when selling.</p>
<p>Amount of Rice</p>
<p>Calculated by Weight</p>
<p>Rice shops which have the bill of lading, can go to the Taikoo Warehouse to release the goods from the miscellaneous grains shops, and go to the Roosevelt Warehouse to release the goods from the rice shops. The subsidized Hong Kong rice being sold this time is 133.5 yuan per bag, and the weight is 224 pounds. The Shanghai Municipal Council has entrusted Babli Sen Davies &amp; Co. at No. 2 Beijing Road and San Y Co. at No. 12 The Bund to handle the weighing procedures. If the weight of each bag of Hong Kong rice is less than 224 pounds, the rice shops can take the weight certificate from San Y Co. and Babli Sen Davies &amp; Co. to Cheung Mow &amp; Co. at No. 20 Guangdong Road to get a refund for the weight shortfall. If each bag exceeds 224 pounds, the rice shops will still need to pay the additional cost.</p>
<p>Afternoon Black Market</p>
<p>Stopped Immediately</p>
<p>The afternoon rice sales in the Edouard Road Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange have been repeatedly ordered to be prohibited by the authorities of the two settlements. However, due to the lack of cooperation and compliance, it has not been eliminated. Instead, it has become more rampant. Now, the French Concession authorities, seeing that it is their responsibility and not willing to sit idly by, have not only ordered their staff to monitor illegal transactions in the field, but also ordered the Miscellaneous Grain Association to strictly stop it. The Association announced to the market yesterday: "The French Concession authorities ordered that from today onwards, all rice transactions, whether spot or futures, or those recognized by the authorities of the two settlements, are not allowed to be bought and sold in this market (including foreign firms). If anyone dares to violate it, they will be arrested and prosecuted without leniency. A collective compliance with this order is required. Do not neglect."</p>
<h3>Rice Cart Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Police Protected Warehouses and Arrested Detectives</p>
<p>Rice Transportation Resumed as Usual</p>
<p>Over a thousand rice cart workers went on strike on the morning of the 12th because their request to manage the rice transportation was not fulfilled. The next day, riots and disturbances broke out. After two mediations by the Shanghai Municipal Council, all parties were able to understand each other, so the resolution could proceed smoothly. It was agreed that the large and small rice would be transported by the handcarts. 40% of the large rice would be pulled by the handcarts, and the rest would be transported by trucks. The labor-capital agreement could have been signed immediately, but since the Rice Shop Association still needed to be decided through a meeting, and the porters (contracting rice) were invited to meet, it was decided to sign at the Shanghai Municipal Council next Monday. The striking workers officially resumed work as usual at 8:00 AM yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Council's detectives guarding the warehouses immediately withdrew. As for the 26 striking workers who were arrested during the disturbance on the 13th, they were sent to the First Special Court Criminal Court and sentenced to seven days of hard labor each. If they are converted into fines, two yuan will offset one day of imprisonment. Yesterday, they had already paid the fines and were released.</p>
<h3>Former President of Hankou Chamber of Commerce, Chen Jingshu, Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Jingshu, the former president of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce and current Councilor of the National Government, came to Shanghai with his family after the August 13th Incident and settled at No. 35 Shafei Road, Xiuhua Lane. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese side sent personnel to the French Concession Police to request that Chinese and Western detectives be dispatched to Chen's residence. Chen was arrested while sleeping in bed and taken to the French General Police Station for investigation. It is reported that Chen was originally a businessman, and the government appointed him as a Councilor because he was usually upright. However, Chen had never participated in political work, although he accepted the appointment. He is now in Shanghai and is very concerned about various charities. The reason for his sudden arrest is unknown. It is reported that Chen is still detained in the French General Police Station and has not been extradited by the Japanese. They are investigating his daily activities in detail.</p>
<h3>US-China Trade Week Approaching: Enthusiastic Celebration</h3>

<p>US Navy Celebrates Maritime Day</p>
<p>The entire United States and American expatriates abroad are scheduled to hold a Foreign Trade Week from May 18th to 24th this year.

On Friday (the 23rd), from noon to 2:00 PM, a "Student Banquet" will be held at the American Club to entertain Chinese and American students who will continue their studies in the United States. It is held annually and jointly hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Alumni Association.</p>
<p>Excitement Across the United States</p>
<p>The "Foreign Trade Week" held in the United States is also organized by the Chamber of Commerce. In 1935, a total of 300 organizations participated in the commemoration of this week. In 1939, it had increased to more than 1,500. According to custom, "Foreign Trade Week always includes 'American Maritime Day' on May 22nd." This holiday was established by the American Congress to commemorate the departure of the American ship Savannah in May 1819, which was the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h3>Soviet Consular Interests in Shanghai Taken Over by Soviet Ambassador to Japan</h3>
<p>No Longer Handled by Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai Report by TASS: Officials announced that Soviet consular interests in Shanghai, previously temporarily handled by the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai, have now been directly managed by the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. The announcement was signed by Director Zaitsev of the Consular Department of the Soviet Embassy in Japan and authorized to be published by the Far East Branch of TASS. The announcement reads as follows: "For the purpose of notification, from this date, I have taken over the Soviet consular interests in Shanghai from the Norwegian Consul-General. Hereafter, all requests regarding Soviet consular matters in Shanghai should be addressed directly to the Soviet Embassy in Japan. [Signed] Zaitsev."</p>
<h3>USS Henderson to Carry American Soldiers Home</h3>
<p>Over One Hundred Soldiers Stationed in Tianjin and Peking Complete Their Service</p>
<p>Free Passage on Ship to Return to US via Shanghai</p>
<p>The US Navy transport ship USS Henderson, coming from the United States via Manila and North China, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 24th. At the same time, rumors are circulating in Shanghai that the strength of the US Fourth Marine Regiment will be reduced, but this claim has not been officially confirmed. It is reported that the USS Henderson will arrive in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao, will only stay for 24 hours, and will depart the next day for San Francisco via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu.</p>
<p>North China American Military</p>
<p>123 American Marines stationed in North China, including 70 stationed in Beijing and 53 stationed in Tianjin, have completed their service in the East and are scheduled to board the USS Henderson in Qinhuangdao on May 20th to return to the United States. US officials in Shanghai are keeping the number of American soldiers being transferred back to the United States secret, but unofficial sources say that approximately 300 people will return to the country on the USS Henderson.</p>
<p>Substitute Soldiers Carried</p>
<p>To Fill the Defense in Shanghai</p>
<p>It is expected that the ship will carry substitute soldiers to fill the defense in Shanghai, but it is still questionable whether the number of substitute soldiers will exceed 100. It is reported that all but the drummers and buglers of the US Marine Corps Band originally stationed at the US Embassy in Beijing have been transferred, and some of them will come to Shanghai to replace the Fourth Marine Regiment. There are also some members of the Fourth Marine Regiment Band who will be transferred back to the United States.</p>
<p>Passing Shanghai</p>
<p>Staying for Only One Day</p>
<p>In addition, sailors of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet who have completed their service in the East will also return to the country on the USS Henderson. In the past, US transport ships would stay in port for about ten days. However, the USS Henderson will only be moored for one day this time. Another US transport ship, the USS Chaumont, also only stayed briefly when it passed through Shanghai earlier this year. Traditionally, the two ships alternate their voyages to the East, but since May of last year, the USS Henderson is making its first voyage to the Far East, while the USS Chaumont has made three consecutive voyages.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Rising Frequently</h3>
<p>According to news from the various coal business associations yesterday, large quantities of coal briquettes will arrive in Shanghai around the middle of this month. Also, there are shipments arriving daily. The numbers are not small. The average amount arriving with each shipment is around 5,000 tons. However, amidst this news of the abundance of coal, the price of white coal is still being driven up frequently. These speculators are not competing to purchase large quantities of coal in the market. They are secretly grabbing long-term warehouse receipts, planning to hold onto them and sell them at high prices. As for the price of coal balls, it remains at 296 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Community Holds National Day Commemoration Amid National Crisis</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is Norway's Constitution Day. The Norwegian community in Shanghai is extremely motivated and determined to restore their country as they commemorate National Day amidst the national crisis. At 5:00 PM tomorrow, a commemorative service will be held at the Foreign Cemetery on Avenue Joffre. From 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM, Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires and Mrs. Nordenson will host a reception for all Norwegians in Shanghai at their private residence at No. 111 Columbia Road. From 8:30 PM, a broadcast will be held at the Democracy Radio Station. From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, there will still be a broadcast on that station, promoting the Norwegian aircraft purchase donation. Earlier, at 9:20 AM, Norwegian Consul Giddell will give a commemorative speech at the Hua Mei Electric Cooperation.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Certification Offices to Open Simultaneously in Shanghai and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Representatives from the China National Goods Industry Service Society and the Chinese Manufacturers Association met with Minister of Economics, Weng Wenhao, when he left, to request guidance on organizing domestic goods certification offices. Minister Weng expressed his approval and provided detailed guidance. The date when they can start issuing certificates depends on when Minister Weng formally approves its establishment and commences work. It is expected that the review and certification work can begin at the end of this month. At that time, exports of domestic goods from both Shanghai and Hong Kong will be certified in the same way.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ships on Yangtze River Ordered to Sail South in Succession</h3>
<p>Concentrated in Singapore to Await Repairs and Deployment</p>
<p>Ships Moored in Hankou and Yichang Still Unable to Sail</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, the Yangtze River has been blockaded. Since the Chinese military evacuated Hankou, the entire Yangtze River has been under control. Foreign ships have been forced to stop and anchor, with many anchored in Hankou, and subject to strict surveillance. They are restricted to their original mooring places and cannot move without permission from the Japanese authorities. This has been the case for three years. However, the Taikoo Company's Wulin ship was replaced by the Wuhu ship to carry British troops transferred from Hankou back to Shanghai. Recently, in mid-March of this year, two Dutch ships and one Portuguese ship were specially permitted by the Japanese Navy to be released and return to Shanghai, as reported previously. Now, due to the escalation of the European war, the British Admiralty is requisitioning many merchant ships. Ships sailing in the Far East have been restricted. The Taikoo Company's Beiyang-class Shenjing ship was also ordered to go to Singapore last month to await deployment. The Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies' ships on the Shanghai-Yangtze River route that were docked in Shanghai have been sailing south in succession. Jardine Matheson's last ship to leave Shanghai, the Tonghe ship, left for Hong Kong and Singapore at the end of last month. The Taikoo Company's Huangpu and Wulin ships sailed to Hong Kong and then Singapore on the 4th of this month. The company's last Jiang River ship to withdraw, the Wanyuan, also left Shanghai for Hong Kong this Tuesday (the 13th), and then headed to Singapore. The Jiang River ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies parked in Shanghai have all left the port and sailed south. It is reported that the ships docked in the Yangtze River are still unable to move. At present, Jardine Matheson has the Longhe and Shihe ships on the Hankou and Fujiang River, and Taikoo has the Wuhu, Wusong, and Changsha ships. In the Yichang area, Jardine Matheson has the Jianghe, Xinchanghe, and Qinghe ships, and Taikoo has the Shashi, Xiangtan, Wanxian, and Wanmu ships. The British ships in Hankou and Yichang do not have any hope of sailing downriver at this time.</p>

<h3>Murder on Seymour Road and Wuding Road: Wang Zhengshao Shot Dead - Lawyer and Employee of Xiang Sheng Motors - Died in Ambush After Car Broke Down</h3>
<p>At 1:45 PM yesterday, a murder occurred on Seymour Road and Wuding Road in the Public Settlement. The victim, Wang Zhengshao, a lawyer, was shot three times and died on the spot. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Practicing Law</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Zhengshao, styled Yiyun, was a native of Zheng County, Zhejiang Province, aged 40. He joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China and practiced law, with an office on the 4th floor of the Guohua Bank Building at No. 356 Beijing Road. His residence in Shanghai was No. 4 Anyi Lane, Seymour Road, Wuding Road. He graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tungwu University. In addition to his law practice, he also served as chairman of Xiang Sheng Motors and the White Palace Funeral Home on Great Western Road. He usually used a car with license plate number 2121 for transportation.</p>
<p>Shot Three Times</p>
<p>At 1:45 PM yesterday, Wang left his residence by car after lunch, intending to go to his office. Shortly after leaving the lane, the car's engine broke down when it reached the intersection and could not be driven. The driver got out to check and repair the car. Unexpectedly, a man wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants suddenly produced a pistol and fired several shots at Wang. Wang was hit by one bullet in the head and two in the chest and immediately fell into a pool of blood, barely breathing. The shooter fled and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Died of Serious Injuries</p>
<p>The nearby patrol officers arrived upon hearing the alarm and, seeing the murder, reported it to the police station. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to the scene, but a thorough search yielded nothing. Wang was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died shortly after arriving due to the critical nature of his injuries. The police station is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the murder. It is reported that Wang's family has decided to send his body to the Anle Funeral Home for burial at a later date.</p>
<p>Impoverished and Sick</p>
<h3>Two Rickshaw Pullers, Uncle and Nephew, Drown Themselves in Well</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiaohe (40 years old) and Xu Bao (18 years old), uncle and nephew, rickshaw pullers living in a rickshaw shed in Baoan Lane No. 17, Lane 126, Route Sœurcères in Lokawei, have recently been suffering from illness. Not only were they unable to seek medical treatment, but their illness also prevented them from earning a living, putting them in an extremely impoverished and sick state. They both conceived the idea of ending their lives. On the night of the 14th, the uncle and nephew went out together and committed suicide by jumping into a public well at the entrance of Baoan Lane No. 13, where they lived. It was late at night, and in a secluded place, no one noticed that night. It was not until 10:00 AM yesterday morning that their landlord, Tang Zhifang, discovered them and reported it to the French police.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Grains: Imported Rice's Decline Has Become a Certainty</h3>
<p>There was still no sign of change for imported rice yesterday. Although domestic rice showed a swirling situation, futures prices fell again due to the impact of cheaper rice batches. With too many floating chips of broken rice, there was a rush to sell, and the market was seen as tired and unable to recover. The opening price for Yinghua Si broken rice (one shi and two dou and a half) yesterday morning was 108.5 yuan, similar to the low price quoted the previous night, and slightly less than the opening price the previous afternoon. Because there were more sellers than buyers, it immediately dropped from 107 yuan, 6 yuan, to as little as 105 yuan, a huge drop of 5.5 yuan compared to the previous afternoon. Small Jiaoyuan bao (one shi and two dou and a half) also opened lower at 138 yuan, Saigon No. 2 at only 136 yuan, and No. 1 dropped from an opening price of 140 yuan to as little as 136.5 yuan, all slightly lower than the previous day. The opening of domestic rice was already weak and lifeless, and the opening price was weaker than the evening market of the previous day. However, as local buyers inquired and major players held their ground, the market stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, floating holders sought to sell due to nervousness, and the market softened. Total trading volume was more than 7,000 bags, Yinghua Si 8-900 tons, Saigon No. 1 123 yuan to 121 yuan, No. 2 115.5 yuan to 114.5 yuan, Small Jiaoyuan 115 yuan to 112 yuan, Min Dang 116 yuan to 114 yuan, broken rice 90 yuan, down to 78 yuan.</p>
<p>The arrival and sales of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice were scarce, and the market did not change, remaining stable. The opening price for Kaixi japonica was 40 yuan, Kun japonica 138 yuan to 133-34 yuan, Zhongguan yuan bao 137 yuan, Nangang Zhongguan early and late rice 132-33 yuan, yuan bao 138 yuan to 137.5 yuan. As for glutinous rice and glutinous tea, none were opened.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Fluctuation</h3>
<p>The current vermicelli market is fluctuating. As rice prices continue to fall and the arrival of Dingfen in Shanghai is constant, it is difficult to boost morale. However, stockpilers in the industry absorb whenever prices are low, and Nanyang buyers also take advantage of cheap purchases. Therefore, the market stops falling when it wants to fall. Today, 200 bags of Australia vermicelli of the Flower Bird brand were traded at 31.25 yuan, American vermicelli of the Fortress brand at 30.08-9 yuan, and Kan vermicelli of the Golden Dragon brand at 30.05-07 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 10,000 bags. The price of Hua factory's discounted vermicelli remains the same for now and has not changed. The future of the market is also in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains in a state of holding. The supply of goods in the market dried up early, and both buying and selling were at a standstill. The purchase of goods by Japanese factories at the market has also become scarce. It is said that the current market price of Gaodu wheat is 45-46 yuan, a slight decrease of 1-2 yuan compared to before, but there is no formal opening.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Corn Reaches Its Peak and Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the markets for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes were struggling under a sluggish atmosphere. In short, with a sharp rise, there is bound to be a sharp fall. Smiling all the way and crying all the way is the usual sight in the market. Now, the bulls are losing, and the bears are thriving. Yesterday, the price of corn fell first and then collapsed, but its potential is still weak and unable to recover. As a result, it continued to fall by 1.4-5 yuan. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bags of spot goods were traded, and 50 tons of futures. The opening price for Saigon old goods was 27.5 yuan to 28 yuan, and the price for new goods was 29.5 yuan to 30 yuan. Spot Yinghua Si was 56 yuan, Dutch white corn was 30.5 yuan, and yellow corn was 31.5 yuan to 32 yuan. The price for April lower delivery and May upper delivery (including water fee) was 60 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 1,000 bags of raw peanuts were shipped from Tianjin yesterday (the 15th), as well as 400 bags of beans. 884 cans of raw oil were shipped from Qingdao.</p>
<p>Today (the 16th), 360 bags of beans, 400 bags of raw peanuts, and 200 bags of sesame seeds will all be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Ripples Slightly, Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw flat rates quoted by HSBC across all currencies. The black market for British exchange remained stagnant, while the US exchange tightened initially but also stabilized. International rumors were mixed. After the morning opening, it was heard that settlements were being made for imported rice and Dutch sugar. The US dollar softened to 5.3125 yuan. British exchange was also scooped up by a certain Japanese bank, and it was difficult to settle at 3 pence, 1/8, 1/25. Around 10:30, there was a sudden rumor of a Sino-British-American military alliance. The tightening stopped and returned to flat. In the afternoon, news of the devaluation of the US dollar came. Hong Kong Electric and Tao Heng sold off June futures at 5.375 yuan, which was difficult to sell, or could be settled. However, speculators forcefully scooped up, and soon it returned to flat. In the end, British gold remained at 3 pence, 1/8, 1/25, and the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan. Trading was quite active.</p>

The international exchange rate for the US dollar in Shanghai rose by two cents, while the rest remained unchanged. The central exchange rate for all currencies was unchanged. The opening selling price of domestic banks in the early market was 3 pence, 1/8, 1/25 for spot British exchange and 5.34375 yuan for the US dollar, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day.

<h3>Conflicting News, Gold Market Speculation</h3>
<p>Lost and Confused</p>
<p>The black market for raw gold yesterday initially rose and then suddenly turned lower. People from all sides were extremely uncertain. The reason was that domestic and international news and rumors were conflicting, and it was impossible to determine which were bullish and which were bearish. At the morning opening, it continued the upward trend after the previous day's close, and with the US dollar softening to 5.3125 yuan, it opened at 6,500 yuan, the high price for the day. When Xinyuan and Chengji sold off, buying interest dissipated, and a reverse trend began. Furthermore, the rumor of a Sino-British-American military alliance caused foreign exchange to return from tight to flat. Tong Kangyong repeatedly sold off, and the price continued to fall. In the afternoon, the story of the devaluation of the US dollar rose, so in the midst of selling, it retreated to 6,443 yuan. As the foreign exchange did not ease slightly, Yiyuan and Rencheng Yongli moved in, and the market rose by more than 20 yuan, finally reaching 6,463 yuan, a rise of 17 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 70,000 to 80,000 taels. For swaps (May rolling into June), Chengji and Xianghe were on the buying side, moving from a low of 53 yuan to 50 yuan.

The price of ornamental gold initially rose and then returned to flat, remaining at 685 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Rose Very Slightly</p>
<p>Since the June contract (10 taels per bar) in the morning, the mood had been upward after the close in the afternoon of the previous day, and the US dollar was also tightening, so the price was raised. The market opened at 9:15 at 6,500 yuan, which was 54 yuan higher than the closing price in the afternoon of the previous day. Xinyuan, Tong Kangyong, Chengji, Hengji, Xinfeng, and Yongli sold, initially pressing it down to 6,472 yuan. Securities firm Defu bought, raising it to 6,487 yuan. Then, rumors of negative news were heard, and Xinfengyong, Tianyuan, Chengji, Dafeng, Tong Kangyong and Yongli sold, retreating to 6,450 yuan. Xianghe and Yida bought, and at noon, it was raised to 6,482 yuan. Tong Kangyong sold again, down to 6,467 yuan. The noon closing was 6,473 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM at 6,470 yuan. Gonghe and Yiyuan came to sell forcefully, and the rumor of the devaluation of the US dollar arose again, and it was difficult to sell May's 5.375 yuan for the next month. The price then fell sharply by more than 20 yuan, retreating to 6,443 yuan. Rencheng Yong, Chengji Securities firms forcefully moved in, and then raised it, and retail investors absorbed, gradually rising to 6,474 yuan. Xinyuan, Defu, Xinfengyong, and Yiyuan sold, advancing to 6,457 yuan. At the 4:00 PM closing, it was 6,463 yuan, a rise of 17 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day.

<h3>US Dollar Swaps - Sellers Discount 3-4 Cents -</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight increase in the black market price, and British and US gold pounds also rose by one yuan each.

The former remained at 2.08 yuan, and the latter remained at 1.78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Rose in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds saw a downward trend in the morning, but there were also those who pushed it up in the afternoon, and it rebounded and rose. It was seen that the bulls made repeated efforts, and a part of the bulls were able to release it at a good price. This kind of abnormal development is not the right path. Because in recent days, there have been general operators in the market who tend to raise prices whenever they fall. However, they can often arouse the optimism of a part of the people, so the market price rises slightly, and someone raises it. The future changes will occur in this ruthless price increase. Yesterday morning, Lianhe and Tongkang bought, and Lianyi and Hengyi sold, and the market price fell by 2-3 jiao. The noon closing also recovered slightly. In the afternoon, Lianhe came again to raise the price. Hongda also had a need, and type C instantly reached 6 yuan, and it entered and exited at the 6 yuan level several times, and was finally held up, and closed at 6 yuan outside. At that time, Lemao released it and got a good price. Dahua and Dingkang also sold it. The closing was better than the next day, from 1 jiao and a half to 6 jiao or so. The total number of transactions was approximately 2 million. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Dachina Match Company were traded at a price of 33 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the stock market of Zhongye Public Office was extremely bleak throughout the day. The price fluctuation was extremely small. The market situation in the afternoon was sluggish and soft, and rubber stocks were traded very little.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Wednesday) telegram: The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks were still flat and stagnant. HSBC Bank's British registered shares uniquely rose half a pound to 72 and a half pounds, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Dutch Distributes Oak Dividends</h3>
<p>Anglo-Dutch East Indies Co., Ltd., managed by the British merchant Huitong Foreign Company, is scheduled to convene the 31st annual shareholders' meeting on May 28th and distribute the share dividends for the year 1940, at one yuan and two jiao of national currency per share, for a total distribution of three yuan of national currency including the interim dividend.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Bullish Chips Closed, Yarn Market Rebounds, Double Horse Near the 500 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to improve. This was because generally financially affluent households were coming to purchase a batch at the Daanfeng, and by pulling with high prices, they would not suffer losses. At the same time, a portion of the chips were absorbed by the bulls, closed, and not released. Therefore, the number of transactions on the market was very strong, and short-sellers could not paste the interest rate. Therefore, everyone said that there was a lack of warehouse orders, and it took until 8 or 9 o'clock every day to ease the warehouse orders. From this point of view, it is beneficial to the bulls. In addition, the foreign American and Indian cotton markets all soared, which is also a benefit for the price increase, so the buyers' intentions were particularly strong, and the bullish mentality was strong again. However, some people say that American cotton is rising, foreign exchange is playing a long game, and margins are downward. If the price goes over 500 yuan, it is okay to sell. The high price of 20-count Varma cotton was 1,494 yuan, and the low price was 1,482 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,494 yuan, and it rose to 1,499 yuan. Then, as the price of gold fell, it fell to 1,486 yuan, but morale was still good, and finally returned to 1,494 yuan, it was said. Today, 1,145 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning due to the improved morale in the afternoon of the previous day, and the price rebounded. The bulls did not lose money, so the buying momentum in the market was strong. The first board price was 1,485 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,494 yuan. At this time, roughly retail investors were buying empty, and then it was heard that the margins were flat and the foreign exchange was not moving, so it returned to 1,484 yuan. However, the tabletop already belonged to the bullish position, and morale was firm and high. Most people were optimistic, and as Indian cotton jumped greatly, the buying momentum was outstanding, rising again to 1,494 yuan. The closing price was 1,492 yuan. The turnover for the half day was approximately 10,705 bales, of which fellow traders accounted for 10,000 bales, and Hong Kong 705 bales.</p>
<h3>American and Indian Cotton Soar Again and Again, Morale in the Cotton Market is Bullish</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is trending well with foreign cotton. The morale of fellow traders is mostly bullish because the American and Indian cotton markets are rising across the board. However, factory owners are unwilling to make large purchases at this time, and numbers houses are also unwilling to boldly move in, making it difficult to achieve smooth transactions. It is learned that the Shenxin Factory has been purchasing a lot of fire machine cotton raw materials recently because of the strong sales of coarse yarn.</p>
<p>Middling 425.5 No. 125 pieces were delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<p>Again, 425 Again, 100 pieces were delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<p>Again, Ordinary 416 Again, 100 pieces were delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<p>Although the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai was not much, the consistent bullish sentiment was driven by the turning of the yarn market and soaring prices of American and Indian cotton. Simultaneously, most merchants holding stock did not want to sell readily.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially rose due to massive public consumption and Washington political news of the Senate agreeing to an 85% loan, but then slightly declined due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was 13-14 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, Washington Electricity, the Bureau of Statistics, published the April U.S. cotton industry statistics left, (clothing unit thousand bales, spindle unit thousand pieces)</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to retail liquidation and rebounded because of active short covering. Then, due to continuous purchases by buyers and scarce inventories, the market suddenly soared. As a result, the closing prices, apart from white Roche, rose by 38 rupees uniquely in April-May, and the rest rose by 10 rupees or more.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that today's opening market will look low at 5.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The Decline of Coarse White is Even Worse</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a further sharp decline due to the continuous decline in recent days, and people's nervousness was even more severe. Therefore, the market price fluctuated throughout the day, and the ups and downs were also as much as 3.4-5 yuan. The association's disc prices, spot 24 coarse white outer warehouse was 106.2 yuan, a drop of 5.3 yuan compared to the previous (13th). The initial price of coarse white for the May 20th period was 108.4 jiao, 7 jiao, 5 jiao, to 8 yuan, and then turned to decline to 107.6 jiao, 3 jiao, 5.6 jiao, and recovered to 6.9 jiao in the middle, suddenly down to 5 yuan, and then closed at 5.9 jiao and 6 yuan, a drop of 4.4 jiao. The May end period also opened at 109 yuan, which was initially good at 9.2 jiao, 4 jiao, and up to 9 yuan, and then fell to 8.7 jiao, 8 yuan, 7 yuan, 6.7 jiao, 4 jiao, and 3 jiao, until 5.9 jiao and 7 jiao, and then rebounded slightly to 106.12 yuan, and even to 7.5 jiao, 4 jiao, 3.5 jiao, and 2.5 jiao, and 3 jiao, and closed at 7.3 jiao, a drop of around 3 yuan. Taikoo Cart White B mark was 110 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Difference Between Sales Prices of Coarse Cloth and Coarse Twill is More Than 7 Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was stable, but the actual demand was flat, and most speculators were also holding back. The sales prices of each cloth differed greatly due to the thickness of the inventory. For example, the cost of 16-pound coarse cloth and coarse twill was the same, but the current market price of coarse twill was (per piece) 7 yuan higher than that of coarse cloth. Moreover, it was also seen that lower-grade fine twill was in short supply, and only fine cloth was in surplus. Shenda Factory's 78-yard twill is now quoted at 77 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous day, with the remaining grades rising by 2 jiao and a half. Coarse cloth and coarse twill rose by 2 jiao and a half each due to the increase in the factory disc prices, while fine cloth declined instead, by 2 jiao and a half. Approximately 300 pieces of gray cloth were traded on this street, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs continued to handle approximately 200 pieces of coarse and fine twill and colored twill. Approximately 3,000 pieces of bleached and printed cloth were handled in Singapore. Today, there are 2,050 pieces of cloth heading to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The opening price of the white goods leader fine cloth was 49.56 yuan, and then the selling prices gradually declined because the actual sales were not strong. The afternoon market price was 48.9 jiao. The price of colored goods, 4 Gentlemen flannel, was 1.5225 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Billets Sales are Slow</h3>
<p>The market for black iron billets remained sluggish yesterday. The number of sales from overseas merchants was sparse, and sales were limited to local can factories, iron printing factories, and machine factories. The number of transactions was not large, so the overall market was not lively. The morale among fellow traders was not strong due to the slow sales. The prices of the margin banks were also weak, such as 2,000-pound billets from the New Steel Factory were offered at 3,200 yuan per bundle, while goods from the Old Steel Factory were sold at 3,300 yuan per bundle, a drop of approximately 50 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: The First Batch of New Bamboo Shoots are on the Way</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Education Department Plans to Enact Regulations for Subsidizing Teachers' Livelihoods to Stabilize Teacher Lives and Intensify Teacher Training</h3>
<p>Establishing Training Methods, Organizing Teacher Registration for Primary Education (Shaoguan Telegram) To greatly increase the number of teachers and promote national education, the Guangdong Education Department has drafted regulations for subsidizing teachers' livelihoods to stabilize the lives of current teachers and intensify teacher training. Currently, there are ten provincial normal schools and seventy-three normal school classes attached to provincial middle schools (including affiliated middle schools of colleges and private middle schools subsidized by the provincial treasury), with 1,994 students. This autumn, it is planned to add eight classes, making a total of eighty-one classes, with a budget to increase the number of normal school students by 400. Preparations are also underway to expand the classes of county-level simple normal schools, establish normal school classes and simple normal school classes in county-level middle schools, and designate county-level junior middle schools to add teacher training subjects. At the same time, county governments will be designated in different regions to work with provincial normal schools to organize national education teacher training classes to train unqualified but capable substitute teachers, enriching the province's teaching force and developing national education.</p>
<p>Establishing Training Methods</p>
<p>The methods for teacher training classes have been established and are planned to train a large number of teachers during the summer vacation. The duration of study is three months, from July 1st to September 30th. The training locations will be selected comprehensively at the provincial Hanshan, Laolong, Zhaoqing, Shaozhou, Leizhou, Changsha, Meizhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, Guangzhou, and Women's Normal Schools, as well as the provincial Dongqu Temporary Middle School, with one class per school and fifty students per class. It is hoped that 600 teachers will be trained during the summer vacation. It is reported that qualified teachers attending the training will have their round-trip travel expenses paid by their local county bureau, and in addition to being exempt from tuition and miscellaneous fees, they will also receive a food subsidy. The total regular amount is more than 33,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Registering Primary School Teachers</p>
<p>The Guangdong Education Department previously received an order from the ministry to conduct a general registration of primary school teachers. It has now been found that all counties in the guerrilla areas cannot hold it. After following the instructions, a total of sixty-one county bureaus have submitted registration forms to the department, with a total of 17,561 people registered. The department has registered and handed them over to the Provincial Primary School Teacher Qualification Examination Committee for review. Certificates have been issued to the county bureaus in accordance with the instructions. A total of 2,861 people are qualified as regular teachers, 1,158 are qualified as substitute teachers, and 5,542 are unqualified. The department has now submitted the handling situation to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Student Summer Assignments</p>
<p>In view of the upcoming summer vacation, the Guangdong Education Department recognizes that many students in the war zone will not be able to return home during the summer vacation and will remain in their schools. It has now specially formulated measures for handling middle school students during the summer vacation, divided into seven items as follows: (1) Students from war zones or those who cannot return home due to traffic obstructions during the summer vacation should still reside in the original school dormitory, and the school shall not charge accommodation fees or other miscellaneous fees. (2) Students staying at school should be managed by personnel designated by the school. (3) Except for the period of participating in remedial lessons, teachers should guide vacation assignments. (4) Those who should take remedial lessons and participate in rear service or social work should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Department of Education. (5) All expenses that students should bear according to the regulations should still be calculated according to the prescribed amount, and no extra fees should be charged. (6) Those who need to subsidize food expenses in the first semester of the 30th year should apply according to the regulations before July 10th. (7) Students graduating this semester should be given practical guidance on further education or vocational guidance. The above measures have been circulated to all middle schools for implementation.</p>

<h3>Hope</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Everyone has hope, the only difference lies in the difference itself.</p>
<p>Hope also has degrees: intense is called fervent hope, urgent is called longing, and near impossible is called extravagant... The most "inauspicious" is naturally disappointment!</p>
<p>Hope also has a scope: treacherous merchants hope rumors will spread like bees, hoarders hope their price increases will be pasted high, and poor scholars hope to have ragged clothes to cover their bodies and thin porridge to fill their stomachs! It is indeed possible to obtain small grain rice from various sources, the more the better, and to distribute it evenly so that it is no longer subject to exploitation by treacherous merchants.</p>
<p>Originally, everything is upside down in the present state, and hope cannot be an exception; however, we will never despair, we still have heat.</p>
<p>Of course, the more extravagant the hope, the more likely it is to be "fulfilled." The lower the hope, the more likely it is to be disappointed, and even merely hoping to prolong the last breath is impossible. But our current "fervent hope" needs to be expanded.</p>
<p>What was hopeless before need not be extravagant now; what was disappointing before must not be allowed to be disappointing now!</p>
<h3>Confessions of a "Neuropathic Apprentice"</h3>
<p>— Sun Jianbai</p>
<p>—"Teach these children"—</p>
<p>I've been idle for a long time, people looked down on me, and I felt uncomfortable myself. Since my uncle was kind enough to get me a job as an apprentice in a trading house, of course I had to thank him profusely. At least I could feed myself—that's what my parents thought, and that's what I thought too.</p>
<p>What kind of work was done in the trading house? What should an apprentice do? I didn't understand at all. I wanted to ask, but I couldn't find anyone to ask. There were people in the house, but those two guys were all arrogant and condescending! Just looking at them filled me with anger. If I didn't understand, I didn't understand, but I couldn't stand those two "straight faces"!</p>
<p>The days passed in a muddle. My job was to write on the blackboard and report market prices. Although I got thirty yuan a month, I always wanted to quit when I thought that I was helping those speculators who disrupted society and manipulated prices! Of course, I was just thinking about it; I was afraid of being idle!</p>
<p>I couldn't stay vague all the time, there had to be a chance for everyone to talk. One morning, I specially bought a pack of cigarettes and brought them to the trading house, hoping to break the ice by offering them a smoke.</p>
<p>I had just offered the cigarettes to the skinny-faced accountant surnamed Li when things went sour. That guy didn't take my cigarettes, nor did he say he didn't want them. He just laughed a few times, took out a pack of "Craven A" from his pocket, lit one, and started smoking, staring straight at the window.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything and turned to look at the other guy surnamed Han. That guy was also sneering contemptuously. I looked down at my blue cloth gown, although it had ten patched spots, my mother had washed it very cleanly, without any oil stains or ink marks; so why was he looking down on me like that? Was it because I wasn't a local? Was it because I was poor? Was it because...? What was it really for?</p>
<p>So I opened my mouth and said, "Mr. Li! My cigarettes are bad, but you shouldn't look down on people like this!"</p>
<p>"You're a student! You don't need to worry about how people treat you. Take the spittoon over there and empty it. There's no teaboy here, so that's your job! As for that lousy cigarette, smoke it yourself! But you're not allowed to smoke it here!" The skinny guy said, his eyes blazing, and the flesh on his face was all taut.</p>
<p>My temper flared up! The ease of making money in speculative business had fostered this guy's "luxury" and "arrogance." I couldn't forget that I had been a teacher and taught many children. I felt that I had to teach this skinny guy a lesson too. I reached out and slapped that "skinny face" so hard that it turned to the side, but I felt relieved in my heart.</p>
<p>The skinny guy was angered by the slap. Together with the guy surnamed Han, he rushed towards me, but didn't dare to lay a hand on me, just cursed loudly.</p>
<p>By the time the neighbors from the next room came to break us up, our two gowns were torn to shreds, and those two guys had been thoroughly beaten by me!</p>
<p>The boss fired me, saying that I had "neuropathic disorder." I ran home. I'd rather die than work for you!</p>
<p>People all said "neuropathic disorder" behind my back. When I thought about it, I felt strange too. The funniest thing was that the skinny guy never expected to be slapped by me the first time. He cursed me as a beast, a hooligan, a bandit. I ignored him completely. I just felt that I had done everything right. In this day and age, whoever bullies me gets beaten!</p>
<h3>Beggar Art</h3>
<p>— Sima Jun</p>
<p>The art of beggars is rarely noticed, and even if some attention is paid to it, beggar art has "appreciable" aspects. But when they follow you around asking for money, it's truly disgusting.</p>
<p>Not all beggars are the same, so their "art" also varies.</p>
<p>Those who beg at the door, in addition to shouting "Boss," swallowing iron pellets, wearing chains, and balancing bowls, these are hard-to-hard arts. Watching him swallow an iron pellet the size of his mouth into his stomach and then thrust a sword into his throat is truly admirable. A chain can be threaded from the nostril to the mouth, and bamboo chopsticks can hold up a bowl. I think this is more magnificent than the art of the circus, because these genuine skills only ask for a few cents in reward, without relying on bragging or publicity.</p>
<p>As for the beggars on the road, they rely on their "three-inch tongue." Following people, they say "Young Master this, Mr. that, Old Master Wealthy," while calling out several times. Their art is to keep talking non-stop, like a string of rolling beads. When the weather is hot, they will fan you from behind with a palm-leaf fan, and sometimes they will shout, "Young Master, watch out for puddles."</p>
<p>However, some people think that the most "basic" thing is to write a petition, in which he writes a "resume," telling all his sufferings and begging "benevolent gentlemen to show their sympathy and bestow a few coins." However, these people want some "face," but in fact, people can see through his "insides."</p>
<p>Looking at the art of beggars above, those who beg at the door are "pragmatic," while those who write petitions, etc., if exposed, may be "worthless."</p>
<p>Campus Scene</p>
<h3>The Last Class</h3>
<p>— Zhu Hu</p>
<p>"Oh, Little Wang, you're here so early."</p>
<p>"You're early too, Old Chen."</p>
<p>The clock clearly pointed to only five minutes before class time. Old Chen threw the book hard on the table, then turned around and took out three cigarettes from his pocket, handing one to Little Wang.</p>
<p>"Old Chen, I heard from Old Cao that you hoarded a lot of coal, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I sold it all off a while ago. I was lucky. If I hadn't sold it off, I would have been at risk!" Old Chen replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I originally had a friend who wanted to hoard hardware with me, but we couldn't agree, so I didn't hoard it. Really, hardware once fell, but now it's back up." Little Wang flicked off the ashes.</p>
<p>A lot of students came to the classroom one after another. Tall Ah Gao pulled Old Chen as soon as he stepped into the classroom door and asked:</p>
<p>"Why isn't Old Yang here? Did he take leave?"</p>
<p>"No, today Miss Shen asked him to go see 'The Merry Cavalier,' and asked me to substitute for him." Old Chen replied.</p>
<p>"That's terrible. People are waiting for his reply on a hundred boxes of foreign candles, but he put it behind his head and is having a good time." Ah Gao was complaining angrily when he suddenly heard the sound of leather shoes. He jumped up happily and said, waving his hand, "Hello, Miss Yin, 5:30 movie tickets, I bought them, 'Heroes on the Sea' at the Grand Theater."</p>
<p>The woman brushed the stray hair behind her ear lightly.</p>
<p>Ah Gao still said with a sly smile:</p>
<p>"No matter if the movie is good or not, after watching it, we can go to the New Asia Restaurant for dinner, and then go to the MGM for a while, wouldn't that be nice?"</p>
<p>Before Miss Yin could nod, the well-dressed lecturer came in. After taking attendance, the students' voices became noisy again:</p>
<p>"Teacher, don't talk about books, talk about current affairs!"</p>
<p>"How should we observe the recent situation in US-Japan relations?"</p>
<p>"Why did Hess secretly leave Germany?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk about international affairs, talk about Shanghai!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Will the price of rice in Shanghai rise again? Which daily necessities will rise?"</p>
<p>The lecturer was speechless. He smiled, adjusted his tie, and began to talk about the recent developments in current affairs; from international affairs to Shanghai. The students listened quietly, occasionally exchanging a few words in private:</p>
<p>"I think we should hoard some daily necessities!"</p>
<p>"No, instead of hoarding, it's better to get some stocks!"</p>
<p>Ah Gao took out his gold-cased watch and saw that it was almost five o'clock. He stood up and winked at Miss Yin, who also stood up.</p>
<p>Class was over. As the lecturer was about to leave, he was surrounded by students outside the classroom again:</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, what goods are you hoarding? Can I buy a share?"</p>
<p>"I want to buy a share too, Mr. ×, are you free? Let's go together! It's my treat."</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>Because of this, although Shao Wen spent a lot of time in the hospital consecutively, trying to comfort him with various words, Qiu Haitang still couldn't sleep without sleeping pills, and even when he did fall asleep, it was only for a short hour or two each time, which gradually led to his mental decline.</p>
<p>"Your family affairs, Miss Luo's affairs, and that scoundrel Ji Zhaoxiong's affairs, I can take care of them for you in one go!" On this day, Shao Wen, urged by both public and private matters, had to leave Tianjin with Yuan Baofan. Before leaving, he repeatedly exhorted Qiu Haitang, "It's useless for you to think about anything now, it only tortures your body in vain! What if I take care of everything for you, but you become seriously ill yourself? Wouldn't that be a waste of all my efforts? So, my good brother, please listen to me and rest in peace! After I return to Beijing, I will write to you at least every three days. I think I'll have good news for you before you even leave the hospital!"</p>
<p>Shao Wen spoke all the way, constantly giving him very sincere smiles, hoping to relieve some of his worries; but the deep sorrow in Qiu Haitang's heart was still as difficult to melt as a frozen block of ice.</p>
<p>In the following three days, he not only slept very little, but his appetite also decreased to the point where it was worse than that of a patient suffering from internal ailments. Although the medical expenses that Shao Wen had prepaid for him still had a lot left, the doctors couldn't help but start to worry; because no matter how unrelated doctors and patients were, curing a patient was certainly more pleasant than watching a patient die!</p>
<p>"The patient in room ten is in even worse condition today, he seems to be in a state of delirium, and he just vomited up the milk he drank," a female nurse hurriedly walked into the office, reporting to the three resident doctors. (107)</p>

<h3>New Contributions of "Cartoon" Creator Walt Disney</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>New Techniques Performed in "Fantasia"</p>
<p>The creation of cartoon films predates movies. The history of "cartoons" began in 1824 when the magic lantern was invented in Europe. The second step in the development of "cartoons" was to photograph them from drawings. In recent years, cartoon films have advanced to having sound and color, with many bizarre scenes and actions. Things that cannot be seen in ordinary films can be seen in cartoon films through the strokes of a pen, because every inch of a cartoon film is carefully drawn by hand, so it takes a long time to produce. The screening time of a cartoon film is usually from twenty to thirty minutes.</p>
<p>In the past, cartoon films were all short films, and "Mickey Mouse" was the best drawn among the short films, so Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse, became famous. He has extraordinary artistic talent and perseverance. He has been tirelessly engaged in the production of "cartoons", and his skills have become increasingly refined. Undoubtedly, he has now become the authoritative cartoon creator in the film industry.</p>
<p>Due to the popularity of cartoon films, under the efforts of Walt Disney, a full-length cartoon film was finally released. "Snow White" shocked the art world and swept audiences around the world. Because of its vivid and detailed drawings, this unprecedented full-length cartoon film broke box office records and was selected as one of the top ten films of the year before last.</p>
<p>Following "Snow White" came Fleischer's "Gulliver's Travels," but because the drawing and other techniques were not as good as Disney's, it failed to give audiences a good impression. Disney's work after "Snow White" was "Pinocchio," although this cartoon film was also successful, it was not as praised by the audience as "Snow White."</p>
<p>His third full-color cartoon feature film, titled "Fantasia," was originally scheduled to be completed before Christmas last year, but was delayed due to production issues and was only recently fully edited and premiered in Hollywood. In this cartoon film, Walt Disney not only exhausted all of his painting artistic talents, but also achieved great success in music. All the dragon surface movements and colors in the film are completely coordinated with the music. It contains Stokowski's adaptation of Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" and Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring," and even more noteworthy is the visualization of Schubert's "Ave Maria." This new attempt has never been seen before.</p>
<p>After completing the cartoon film "Fantasia," Disney is currently starting to produce another new film, titled "The Reluctant Dragon." He contributed a new technique in the wooden film, which is to have real people and cartoon characters acting together. From this point alone, you can know the novelty of its content.</p>

<p>Wang Xichun, this beautiful little bird, has been really popular in both the opera and film circles for three years. However, the life of an artist is not as beautiful as people imagine. The more famous one becomes, the more pain follows. Superficial pleasure cannot represent the inner feelings.</p>
<p>Just imagine: On the one hand, she has to perform Peking opera at the Carlton, and on the other hand, she often works under the mercury lamps at Hezhong. At the same time, the Venus Guolian authorities also want to invite her to guest star in one or two films. How can her weak body sustain such intense work on three fronts? Also, because her diet is unbalanced, she finally developed a stomach illness.</p>
<p>More than ten days ago, just as she was filming "Princess Bi Luo" at Hejia, her stomach illness suddenly broke out, causing her to vomit on the spot and almost faint. Later, she returned home, and the "Dragon and Phoenix Presenting Auspiciousness" that she was supposed to sing at the Carlton was also performed by someone else. She gradually recovered after resting for two days.</p>
<p>Recently, Yan Jupeng performed at the Carlton, which, in theory, should have given her a chance to rest. Unexpectedly, her stomach illness relapsed yesterday, and the condition was quite serious, so she had to lie in bed and ask a Western doctor for treatment. As for Hezhong's "Princess Bi Luo," it had to be suspended.</p>

<h3>Summary of the Philosophy of Vigorous Action</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>The result of actions should absolutely not be for self-interest at the expense of the group. It should be beneficial to both the group and the individual. Sometimes the group and the individual cannot have both, one should sacrifice oneself and fulfill the interests of the group.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Why Do You Pity Him Coming to the Ends of the Earth?</p>
<p>Xu Jing was wondering where the dart came from when he heard a shout from the ridge. A handsome young man came running down, wearing a Wusheng hat, a green silk robe, and quick boots. His face was like jade, his eyebrows were slender, and his cheeks were rosy, making him both handsome and heroic. Xu Jing couldn't help but stare blankly. The handsome young man also looked at Xu Jing for a while, and thought that Xu Jing was also a handsome young man, not an ordinary person, so he cupped his hands and said, "Where do you come from, guest? There are many jackals and wolves in these mountains, and they come out to devour people and animals even during the day. Just now, I came down from the ridge and happened to see you fighting fiercely with that beast. I was afraid that the beast would hurt you, so I wanted to draw my sword to help, but unfortunately I had no weapon in hand. Fortunately, I had a dart with me, so I fired a dart and fortunately killed that evil beast. Please forgive my recklessness." Xu Jing heard the young man speak politely, and couldn't help but admire him even more. Because the young man asked him where he came from, but he couldn't easily explain the reason, he had to say, "My name is Xu Jing, and I came here from Qi County, Henan, to visit relatives, but I didn't find them. I was wandering in the mountains when I suddenly encountered a jackal. Fortunately, you helped me righteously. How can I express my gratitude? You killed the fierce wolf with a dart, which can only be done by someone with extraordinary skills. Please tell me your name, so that I can write it down." The handsome young man smiled and said, "You praise me too much, Mr. Xu, I am ashamed. My name is Liu Yining. I was originally from Jiangnan since I was a child, but later I was displaced to the north. This time I came to Daizhou to visit relatives because my aunt and uncle live here in seclusion. But after I came, my uncle suddenly fell ill and passed away, and my aunt wouldn't let me leave for a while, so I stayed here. When I have nothing to do, I often go to the mountains for a walk. It is a great coincidence that we met by chance. Since you came to visit relatives and didn't find them, why not stay at my aunt's house for a while, until you find out where your relatives have gone, and then make plans." Xu Jing listened, and it was exactly what he wanted, so he put the sword into its sheath, cupped his hands to the young man, and said, "Brother Liu, we have only met for the first time, but you have already shown me such kindness. I am suffering from having no place to eat or sleep. I am very grateful for your kindness and invitation. Is your aunt's residence in this mountain?" Liu Yining nodded and said, "Yes, this mountain is called Weifeng Mountain, and this ridge is called Phoenix Ridge. My aunt's house is on Phoenix Ridge, opposite Suoyi Ridge, which you just passed. Please come with me, Mr. Xu." (64)</p>
