<h3>美國會將通過法案　廣大援助民治國家　羅斯福提案內容包括五項　衆認此舉無異取消中立法</h3>
<p>華盛頓　此間昨日相信、行政部空前之援助中·英·希臘及其他民主國家之法案、將於今日向國會提出、該法案包括一項規定、俾英國戰艦能在美國船塢中加以修理、此外、並另有一項規定、聲明此種步驟、不受其他法律及其他規定之影響、權威方面認為、此舉無異將中立法案及瓊森法案加以取消、因根據此項規定、美國得以出借軍火、可與外國交換國防消息、交戰國受損之軍艦、亦可留泊美國港口也、衆信該法案當可在短期內通過、該法案被稱為「藉以增強美國防務之法案」、內中規定「美總統於渠」為對本國防務有利時、可不顧其他法律之牴觸、隨時授權海·陸兩部長及其他部長以執行下列各事、（一）命令軍工廠製造各種軍火、以供給任何凡經羅斯福總統認為有關美國國防之國家、（二）以任何國防用品、以出售·轉移·交換·租賃·出借或贈送之方式、交與此項政府、（三）為他國政府檢騐、査視·修改·修理或調換國防用品、（四）與外國政府交換國防情報、（五）准許國防用品出口、所謂國防用品者、即「任何武器·彈藥·飛機·船隻·機器·設備·工具·原料或工業所需之供應、與工作有關之物品」是也、該法案授權總統、能與他國政府交換獨特之國防計劃及草案、此外、並規定各該政府不得將取得之原料、不經總統許可而轉交他人、此項合同、並應對美國人民之私有商標權利、充分予以尊重、羅斯福總統在招待記者席上稱、渠個人並不希望取得法案中所規定之權力、惟「必須有人取得此種權力、則為顯然之事」、渠稱、美國之政策、果在援助民主國家、使之繼續生存、則必須增加合法之速率、總統不允預測如欲實行此等計劃、將需費用幾許、渠稱、該新法案中、將不至修改瓊森法案、査瓊森法案、係規定對未付戰債之國家、拒絕貸予信用貸款者、據稱、新法案所謂「可不顧其他法律之規定」者、乃在避免與瓊森法案及中立法案發生衝突云、總統云、該新法案如在國會延擱一星期、則七月間美國對民主國家重要原料之交貨、亦將至少延期一星期、渠稱、在國會未將在美國政府軍工廠或船塢中、為外國製軍火之討論、加以結束之前、渠不準備向國會提出眞正之預算要求、肯州民黨參議員白克萊氏為將此法案向參院提出之人、瑪州民主黨衆議員麥柯馬克氏、則代表向衆院提出、麥柯馬克氏云、「此即表示吾人應與吾人之友人製造用品、一如為吾人本身然也」、渠又稱、該法案可使美國向美洲各共和國、加拿大及其他與美國國防有重要關係之國家、購買美國所缺乏之原料、同時、羅斯福吿新聞記者稱、自二月一日起、美國銅·鋅·黃銅·靑銅·鎳·木炭之出口照會制度、即將發生效力、總統又稱、美國出口控制署即將決定是否將發出准許、一如前此對多種重要原料然、（十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>休戚攸關國家戰具　美將代為配備修理</p>
<p>華盛頓　行政領袖昨將羅斯福總統援助民治國之提案提交參·衆兩院、此案主張（一）總統可於其認為有益於國防時、在美國管轄下兵工廠或工廠或船廠、製造或覓取任何國政府所需要之任何防具、而該國防務、係總統視為與美國防務有安危關係者、（二）總統可將任何防具售與或轉交、或租與、或借與上述任何政府、（三）總統可為上述任何政府試騐或修理、或配備、或整理任何防具、（四）總統可將關於第二節所規定任何防具之任何國防情報通知上述任何政府、（五）總統可將任何防具放行運交上述任何政府、國會領袖同時發表一文、解釋第三節關於試騐或修理等事之條文謂、無論在美製造與否之防具、皆可在美修理、試舉例明之、如英國巡洋戰艦令譽號、亦可在美國白羅克林海軍船廠修理、亦須總統認為在美國國防利益上着想、宜有此舉也、此節涵義頗廣、凡美國任何海·陸·空根據地、皆可為任何國家共防務與美國國防有安危關係者修理或配備其戰具云、此案名援英案、准撥必要數額之經費、以實施其條文、估計其經費達一百萬萬元、參議員白克萊乃參院行政領袖、對於此案中國防情報一節、有所解釋、調此節授權總統、得酌量以所有圖案、稿樣或其他情報用於特殊設備、此種情報僅適用於根據此案供給外國之防具、而政府可為外國政府定購防具、僅以美國海·陸軍所可用者為限云、援英案將總統以美國為民治國兵工廠之政策、化為法案形式、而實行總統所發以日形增多的船隻·飛機·坦克車與大砲、運交民治國之諾言、此案可使美國以各種戰具供給其防務為總統認為與美國國防有安危關係之國家、國會領袖所發之文吿、說明總統可許任國防具出口一節、謂一九四〇年取締某種軍用品出口之禁令、已因此而終止、但此節未規定用美船裝此戰具前往戰地、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>美國又將頒新禁令　限制銅鋅鎳等輸出</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統、昨對新聞記者力言迅速行動以戰具租借民治國之重要、謂援英案所給予之廣大權力實屬需要、蓋如是始可有迅速行動也、渠現已簽定布吿文、自二月一日起、凡紫銅·白銅·黃銅·鋅·鎳與炭酸鉀、皆須領照始許輸出云、記者詢以此事是否驅逐艦出借、總統答稱、無人有此建議云、總統又稱、撥款可分兩部、一為立即需用之現款、一為將來定購之準備云、國會某領袖於會議後吿人、此案可於一月內或五星期內送交總統署名云、其他領袖似皆信此案可迅速通過、但亦知國會中尤其是參院將有若干反對、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　「援英議案」之得大多數贊許、果如所料、當此案在衆院提出時、曾有十餘議員起立加以批評、而同時提出於參院之時、有參議員麥克基拉氏發言、稱希特勒為「具人形的魔鬼」、而孤立派參議員克拉克則謂、此案允許羅斯福總統「宣戰」並在內政方面將成為極權政府、各議員對於此案是否已充分週詳、足以核准美船載軍用品赴英或恊約國、意見頗不一致、另一衆議員謂、「此為促使吾人趨向極權主義之步驟、實為戰爭而非和平」、參議員麥克基拉提議、將一切法律之足以干預吾人以總統或國會認為必需之援助給予英國者、一律予以取消」、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　參院外交委員會主席喬治宣稱、在援英議案條款之下、美海軍船艦將不能護送商船前往歐洲、該議案之草案曾經修正、以使此點更為明瞭、此案將於星期一日由衆院外交委員會加以考量、參院外委會則定於星期三日、孤立派各參議員曾於星期五晚間開會、集議戰勝此案之辦法、但一般意見、皆認為彼等將衹能獲得少數及對票額、聞許多擬投票贊成此案之參議員、將試圖對於賦予總統之權力、加以若干限制、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美迅速擴大海軍　隨時支持國策　新任總司令發表談話　此後將繼續調動戰艦</h3>
<p>華盛頓　將於二月一日繼任美國艦隊總司令之金麥爾少將、昨日表示將竭力增進該艦隊之效果、隨時支持國家之政策、氏昨日接見記者時、拒絕發表使該艦隊達於完全準備狀態之肯定計劃、其唯一之回答為、「吾人曾在過去將戰艦予以調動、此後亦將如是」、渠稱、渠對新任命之來、殊出意料之外、故不對討論任何詳細之海軍程序、唯渠稱、「美國之海軍刻正在迅速擴大中、以期達到完全之實力、吾人現方建造新艦、召集官兵、予以武裝、最近受總統指出而創造之新的太平洋及大西洋兩艦隊、卽為海軍已見擴大之表示、君等當能深信、余此後將繼前人之工作而加以推進、俾隨時可在政府有所命令時、對國策予以支持焉」、（十一日合衆電）</p>

<p>美將請英　協助經費　俾製造軍用品</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間高級官稱、政府當局為謀「援英議案」順利通過國會起見、已允發表英國或將被請、協助應付所接濟各種軍用品之經費、有人曾提議英國對於此項軍用品、應在美存儲約二十萬萬元美金之資產、作為附加之担保品、此三十萬萬元、係英人所持有美國不動產及在美經營各英國公司之價値、此項資產將置於美政府各機關中為担保（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美代表與英相　商討遠東局勢　美國決意援助中國　英將加強抵抗日本壓迫</h3>
<p>華盛頓　外交界人士頃稱、美國增強太平洋防務法案中之租借程序、實具有廣泛之重要性、而中國亦經該案提明為美國決意援助之民主國家之一、此間之觀察家、對於羅斯福派赴倫敦特使霍浦金氏在倫敦所發表之談話、尤為注意、緣霍浦金曾稱、美國已在盡全力從事英·美·中·希四國所用軍需之生產、遠東外交人士推測、霍浦金、英首相邱吉爾、甚或外相艾登三人、必已商討東方局勢、若干人士謂、此一因素、或將搆成霍浦金所負使命之重要部分、恐以後英國或將加強抵抗日本之壓迫、亦未可知、英國於柏慕達稅關事件所表現之立塲、已可徵知英國所採步驟之強硬、柏慕達英國稅關官吏、最近曾將首途赴德之日本旅客所有財物予以扣留、而倫敦之英國官方、亦認柏慕達稅關官吏之行動、係職權範圍以內之事、此間外交人士又信、霍浦金必已與英國商討美國利用太平洋英國各根據地事、各根據地中、其顯著者如新加坡、已由英、美及澳洲三國作廣泛之察勘、尤可注意者、澳洲與美國最近竟互派海軍武官、此為前所未有之創舉、外交界又稱、一般人士均普遍相信、美國於太平洋事務、或將以從容不迫之態度而邁進、若輩以為、英、美、澳三國政府、必在審愼從事、甚或秘密進行、俾避免任何足以引起糾紛之情事、其所以如此、係為（一）美孤立派人士對夏威夷以外之太平洋問題、尚水準備負起責任、（二）避免過度刺激日本、美國之政策、因已係堅強準備抵抗任何日本在新加坡附近之新侵略、然同時亦欲避免任何侵略性質之行動、若任何足以激起日本侵略之行動、多數權威人士相信、設美國與英國成立利用新加坡之協定、則日本或將不顧一切、拼死而發動一軍事的報復、以是外交專家一致相信、霍浦金之談話、似尚未發展至一具體之協定、惟對業經表示之種種目的、或已增進相互之諒解、若輩以為、美國或不致贊同利用新加坡之建議作借款程序之部分酬答、此項行動、結果並非增加國會中少數孤立主義之敵視、是以關於新加坡之任何協定、非至將來英、美兩國認為有以強烈外交行動對付日本之必要、或戰略上之必要時、恐不致宣布、（十一日合衆電）</p>

<h3>巴爾幹局勢的開展</h3>
<p>正盛傳德軍開入保加利亞，準備進攻希臘薩洛尼加的時候，蘇聯忽與德國簽訂三種協定：一為經濟協定，規定今後一年半中雙方貨物交換數量，當較第一年為多；二為波羅的海沿岸三國德僑遷移協定：三為雙方自波羅的海迄匈牙利邊境的疆界協定；細考協定內容，或僅是舊事的延續，或僅完成了外交文件，並沒有新的意義新的開展；但不先不後，成立於德國決計侵保援義的今日，這當然不是偶然的巧合，而是希特勒向巴爾幹發動軍事攻勢之前，在外交方面一種計畫的作為。</p>
<p>據一昨羅馬尼亞京城所傳出的消息，德軍殆已開入保境，但確否待考。假定德國和蘇聯簽訂上述協定的內情，的確包含莫斯科容忍德軍假道保加利亞的妥協，吾人不禁要問：蘇聯既於去年十一月杪，勸阻保國加入軸心，何以現在又肯容忍德軍入保，以威脅她自己出入黑海的門戶——達達尼爾海峽？這不是前後矛盾嗎？世人對於此問，似乎祗有兩種可能的解答，一即希特勒對於蘇聯，已給予相當的代價，足使現實主義的莫斯科當局改變他們不願戰事波及保加利亞的初衷，二即史丹林已因三十萬德軍的開入羅馬尼亞而感到威脅，不得不權衡重輕，分別緩急，以避免本身的捲入戰爭漩渦。依照第一種假定，說不定保加利亞將要遭遇波蘭第二的運命，亦即由蘇聯取其毘連黑海和土耳其的東半部，以保障海峽的「安全」，而由德國支配其西半部，以作為德軍直趨希臘的甬道；至若依照第二種假定，則誠如本報日前所論，莫斯科不願以實力相拚的弱點，已被德國覷破，因此自甘雌伏；今後在德國給予相當保證的條件之下，自惟有姑作痴聾，繼續其所謂「中立靜觀」政策，以待新機運的來臨。</p>
<p>吾人既苦於情報之不足，此際對於德蘇簽約之眞實內幕如何，惟有暫置不論；因為此中的來龍去脈，一俟德國次期軍事攻勢發動之後，當即水落石出；而當前值得研討的，倘若德國竟如所傳，假道保加利亞，以攻略希臘時，則東地中海戰局究將受到一個什麽影響？試展閱地圖，不難見到希臘東部的領土不過是一條濱海的狹長地帶，希特勒若利用機械華部隊和大量空軍，以閃電戰的姿態，由保加利亞方面進攻，則希臘軍能否抵禦，自屬勞人焦慮。但從另一方面講，德國也儘有許多不利的因素：第一，德軍假道保加利亞的可能，並不是什麽新問題，而是三個月來的老問題，這在英希聯軍方面當然早已預料及此；因此相信薩洛尼加一帶必已有相當的佈置，一旦有事，不但英國陸軍預料必能很快地登陸助戰，即英國海空兩軍恐怕也早有相當的配置；所以英希聯軍在這一方面，正是處於以逸待勞的境地，對於遠來的德軍，當不致束手無策。第二，土耳其曾經一再宣佈過，保加利亞如果加入戰爭，她便不惜協助希臘作戰；雖說土國態度今後或者仍須以莫斯科的意向為轉移，但她的强大陸軍終究是德國的一個可能的勁敵，而為希特勒所不能視若無覩。第三，義大利在地中海兩岸的戰事，差不多逼近一敗塗地的局面，地中海的「制海權」現已完完全全握於英國海軍手中，德軍即使攻入希臘境內，仍難搖撼英車的這一「制海權」；萬一戰事因不能如願地迅速展開，而再度陷入膠着狀態，則時間一拖長，英希聯軍可能在美國加緊援助之下，更於制海權之外，取得地中海上的制空權，這樣，義大利既成了甕中之鼈，德國也祇多了一處戰塲，分散了全部實力而已。</p>
<p>總之，希特勒必須在地中海戰局不可救藥之前，亦即在英國切實把握制海制空兩權之前，作「孤注一擲」，這是早在世人預料之中的；照這幾天的形勢看來，他的角鬚似乎正針對着巴爾幹，而莫斯科當局似乎又要再來一次令人不易了解的「坐視」或「偏袒的中立」，但是未來的發展決不以此為止境，這是可以斷言的。至於蘇德之間新訂的三種協定，在目前的一霎那，自保持了蘇德歡洽無間之觀，不失為希特勒外交的成就；但並沒有使蘇聯受何新拘束，負何新義務。一切一切，必隨着今後的戰局而開展，直演變到業已註定了的結局為止——亦即公理正義勝利的結局為止。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（廿九）　英軍官西綫日記</h3>
<p>昨晚謠傳轟炸機司令將派遣英機往炸愛森。德軍正深入法國，而轟炸機反注重愛森，這又何能遏止德軍在法境的猛進？轟炸機司令理應集中全力，炸毀末斯河上主要的渡口，破壞敵軍的陣形，攻擊他們自東徂西沿各大路前進的密集部隊。我知道這不是英空軍的職務，然而事情緊急，亟應改變方針纔是！</p>
<p>今天我們所希望和祈求的是指揮的統一。現在作主的人實在太多了，議論紛紜，聚訟莫決，若由一個獨裁者發號施令，反可易於成事。</p>
<p>正午十二時：我軍又敗退了。德軍機械化部隊兩師團，經由凡爾溫和布芒向西追擊。里姆斯守軍已撤退，我們奉令再向西北移動，以繞到亞眠英軍後面。</p>
<p>下午八時：據法軍報告，他們正在對着末斯河畔的袋形陣地，佈置大規模的反攻。英軍將於今夜開往該處，明天再開回埃斯攷脫河一綫。但望我們的戰鬥機，能將德國轟炸機驅逐凈盡才好！</p>
<p>五月十七日：戰局不很順利，法國第七軍和英軍正在搶退，擬退守安特衛普和不魯塞爾後面塞納河至查婁洛一綫。</p>
<p>我軍並未反攻。不魯塞爾南面英軍右翼已被敵衝破，局勢嚴重。法國第九軍現仍受困，唯第一第二兩軍，可向末斯河敵軍凸角作側面攻擊。</p>
<p>五月十七日正午十二時：戰事愈惡化，所可憤慨的是法軍中許多部隊，並不在眞正作戰。德軍裝甲師團，已使他們無法抵抗。這與波蘭戰事，如出一轍。</p>
<p>下午五時：空軍中突擊隊已出發攻擊拉翁，拉費爾，瓦期河，至加都，阿文納，凡爾溫，克來賽，和勒德爾東西之錢。全區實際上已成無人之地，愛納河沿岸和河北僅散佈着少數法軍，拉費爾和里貝蒙的橋樑已被德軍佔領。法軍毫無反攻的準備，結局已是很明顯</p>
<p>五月十八日：我們最初所期望的消息，今天已從各方面絡繹傳來。法軍已向敵軍反攻。吉勞特將軍發來戰報說，「德軍輕重戰車各五十輛已向我軍進攻，我軍正在逐漸圍殲之中。」這是向來的刻板文章，是我們倚賴遏阻德軍攻勢的一班將士的特色。</p>
<p>法軍士氣，今晨雖已稍見振奮，但德軍利用第五縱隊散佈種種謠言，從後方傳出，前錢士氣又突轉衰落。</p>
<p>八時五十分：我們奉命在今夜退往凡爾賽拉費德地方所設前敵總司令部曾遭敵機矗炸，幸而喬治將軍和參謀人員均已及時離開，得免於難，或者這是語言亦未可知。</p>
<p>在第一號兵房內吃了一頓精美早餐。這座堡壘在上次歐戰中是英軍司令富蘭區將軍的司令部，幽雅的花園，寬闊的石徑，一片和平氣象，使人不信二十英里之外，即爲戰塲。眞是一個奇特的對照。</p>
<p>我已讀了甘茂林將軍要求法國軍民堅持勿退，辭意動人的軍令。這是歷史的重演呢，還是歷史的模倣呢？我覺得這不過是模倣歷史吧了。他們要使我們相信馬爾納河轉敗爲勝之役將重演於今日，可是他們自己也相信嗎？</p>
<p>假使法軍能將德軍十個裝甲師團全部殲滅，敵人的攻擊即可消滅。法軍七十噸重戰車，前曾喧傳一時，實際却並不多，已造成的至多不過二十輛。在德軍攻勢未展開以前，法軍很希望有機會用這毽職車去掃蕩德軍裝甲師團。法國軍官曾誇口說，他們至少有重戰車一千輛，現在方知遠不及敵軍所有。他們也曾奮勇作戰，陷陣衝鋒，一往無前，可是遇到了裝甲堅厚的德軍戰車隊，便無法可施，終至完全瓦解。此次德軍的獲勝，完全得力於急降轟炸機和裝甲師團的呼聲。五月十八日：我們須經由倫敦空軍部，方能與英國遠征軍通訊了。</p>
<p>五月十八日晚十時：德軍機械化師團依然橫衝直撞，已到達了貝洛納和剛白萊。今午空軍分隊轟炸敵軍戰車六十輛，頗爲得手。英法聯軍準備在明日偵察敵軍機械化部隊集中點，然後一舉加以摧毀。法軍輕摩托化師團不是德國重戰車隊的敵手，七十噸重戰車，旣是沒有，祇好用空軍攻擊的一法了—至少法軍高級司令部的說法是如此。</p>
<p>聽說色塞袋形地方面，德軍裝甲部隊約有六師之衆。五月十九日晨四時：空軍司令遣我準備第一次出擊。德軍大隊正開始在拉翁以東前進，有步兵一師團駐在大狄寨。德軍戰車隊衝達剛白萊和貝洛納以西，縱橫自若。法軍司令部已離開阿拉斯，據說正在移往波洛業。德軍這些戰車隊，並無大隊人馬，繼之前進。在六十英哩內，祇有機器車隊和戰車隊而沒有步兵。據阿拉斯一位憲兵講，他遙見戰車一隊，由大路而來，便阻住橫路交通，招呼牠們開過。直至車上開火，方知是德軍戰車，可見當時事要進行之速，出人意料之外。他居然能死裏逃生，向人講述這一樁故事，實在可奇</p>
<p>下午三時：消息傳來，德軍機械化部隊已開抵亞眠。這不啻是夢魘一般。英軍已是被隔絕了。我們的交通錢已是被阻斷了。英軍此時，祇有儘速撤退的一法了。我依照命令，把所有公私文件付之一炬。這種辦法，祇在悲劇中讀過，做夢也想不到我們竟會身勝其境</p>
<p>今天聯軍當局舉行會議。狄爾將軍怱怱從倫敦飛來。據稱他會宣言英軍將戰至最後一入，最後一彈。法軍聞之，當可感到滿意了。</p>

<h3>美加强遠東行動後　日政策徬徨失措　日進出口貿易半全陷停頓軸心國僑民亦已開始撤退　由日來滬之外僑解剖日本政情</h3>
<p>據最近由日來滬之某外人對記者稱、在過去數月內英美旅日僑民、或因接受政府之勸告、或由於自動、均已在逐漸撤退中、蓋恐一旦美國與日本參加歐戰、則寄居異國、決非安全之道、由於此種影響影響、且美國參戰氣氛、最近更趨濃厚、因之軸心國之旅日僑民、亦已開始撤退、但後者大半屬於經濟原因、</p>
<p>一切貿易全將喪失</p>
<p>以自此次歐戰爆發後、日本與歐非二洲之貿易關係、已易關係、已被阻斷、目下日本商人及僑日之外籍商人之唯一市塲為西半球、美國及南美各國、但美日貿易之限制、言趨加緊、如果此二市塲被阻斷、則日本之進出口貿易、將完全陷於停頓、今美國之參戰、幾僅時間問題、則將來軸心國與日本間之貿易路綫、實處於美國砲火下、甚至中國與日本之交通、亦將受嚴重之危險、此時之日本、惟有坐而待斃而已、故旅日外僑之陸續撤退、即所以作未雨綢繆之計也、</p>
<p>徘徊瞻顧進退失據</p>
<p>某外大又稱、日人之行動、實自食其報、其最大之錯誤、為與德義簽訂同盟條約、其初原係對美作虛聲恫嚇者、不料竟弄巧成拙、日本國內幾無一人願與美國開戰甚至日本之軍事皆層中、亦不願與美交戰、蓋自知實力有所不逮也、但彼等已深陷於外交泥淖中、如在日軍之深陷於軍事泥淖者然、進旣不能、退說不可、</p>
<p>日本民衆漸次覺醒</p>
<p>日本大民以前一向信仰盲目、至今已開始懷欵、祇以處於壓力之下、無能為力、但彼等對於若干宣傳、已不復信任矣、某外人繼種、日水人民在過去二年間不滿現狀之情緒、已溢言表、日政府為「殺鷄駭猴」計、對於旅日外僑動輒誣以惡意宣傳、妨害「東亞新秩序」及間諜等罪名、新近美國學校敎師一批、由美抵日、意在考察遠東之實情、留居日本不數月、即乘興而來、販興而去、</p>

<h3>華捕離崗小便　捕頭查崗衝突　捕頭堅稱華捕意圖行兇　昨日開審該捕被判拘役　前夜靜安寺捕房特別戒備　昨法院防範嚴密禁止旁聽</h3>
<p>前晚公共租界靜安寺捕房、突然嚴重戒備、當時有大批武裝探捕、及預備隊中西警員、紅色警備　等、全體出動、咸在捕房四週、往返梭巡、形勢十分嚴重、茲經記者探悉、此種戒備、因有一華捕與西副捕頭發生衝突而起、</p>
<p>離崗小便</p>
<p>緣有靜安寺捕華捕徐州人白桂舫、前晨八時四十分鐘、與二四八〇號·二五二七號·兩華捕、及一五八號三道頭印捕、奉派在新閘路底佈崗、而以印捕爲領班、其時該捕房西副捕頭俄人可强司基、乘坐機器脚踏車巡崗經過、見白捕不在崗位、乃向印捕詢問、據答、離崗小便、移時、白捕到來、該西捕頭以其不應擅離職守、且有十分鐘之久、欲回行報告處罰、白捕則以前去小便、曾得印捕允許、且祗二三分鐘、似不應故意謊報、言語間遂起衝突、</p>
<p>手槍走火</p>
<p>馴至動手互推、西捕頭指其欲撥槍開放、乃喝令　印捕將白捕之手槍奪下、在爭奪手槍之際、忽然走火、致碰然一響、子彈射出、幸槍口向下、未曾傷人、結果槍被奪下、白捕當被帶入捕房、當時其他　捕聞悉、均表示不服、　集不散、捕房恐發生意外、乃嚴加戒備、咋晨白捕由捕房解送第一特院刑八庭、依刑法三〇五條以强暴妨害自由罪起訴、而華捕百名、因激於義憤、亦到庭旁聽、致特一院大門口、亦戒備森嚴、</p>

<p>租界當局、鑒於本市食米價格飛漲、推源其故、大部為米　居奇操縱囤積所造成、直接影響於平民之生計、間接促成治安之不寗、為抑平米價、除評定限價外、更施行運米出界須領派司等等限制辦法、最近有米商多人、因</p>
<p>超越限價</p>
<p>賣買、經捕房拘解特一法院、判處重刑、近數日來米價因之得以稍平、然警務當局並不因此稍懈、其工作除已飭派大批密探、紛向倉庫堆機調査存米、以究囤積大戶外、對越價賣買之輩、亦嚴予偵査、有閘北大統路五十號協成米號主黃鶴亭、於最近在米市塲向江西路四百六十七號盛興米行、購進二號西貢米卅包、其價格每石為八十三元、超越限價每石達一元五角、而</p>
<p>協成購進</p>
<p>此米、原擬運至閘北、但依照工部局定章、運米出界者、必須附具發票、塡具聲請書、向工部局政治部請領出界派司、而盛興以此項賣買、越過限價、為願開具發票、黃鶴亭乃異想天開、向阿拉白司脫路洽與裡四號鑫源雜糧號借得空白發票一紙、自行塡寫貢米五十包、計價四千五百元、後又改成三十包、並注明每石價為八十三元、而聲請書上注明該貨</p>
<p>存於鑫源</p>
<p>擬運往閘北除派學徒朱惠賓向政治部請求發給出界派司、詎為該部華探目茅國寳·探員李弼軍發覺以上種種、更査得該米並非存於鑫源、實存在羅斯福堆機、以此事件、不特越價賣買、且有朦領派司嫌疑、遂將李惠賓扣留、昨晨解送特一法院刑四庭、捕房律師方福樞請求准予羈押、俾對主犯</p>
<p>査明拘究</p>
<p>經裴推事質訊一過、諭令朱惠賓准予羈押一星期再訊、聞捕房對本案各有關主犯、正在偵査、擬予訴究、而不久期內且恐將有大批囤戶米姦、將受非常時期「評定物價及取締操縱投機辦法、」「農礦工商管理條例」兩法規之嚴厲制裁、經工部局之以最大努力、本市米市預料或能迅卽於最短期內</p>
<p>予以抑平</p>
<p>而一般米姦若仍執迷不悟、徒知中飽私囊、不顧民生痛苦、一味橫行、不回改悔、則牢獄之痛苦、立即將至、屆時身敗名裂、雖欲懺悔、恐已不及也、</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>火油（二）（續七日）</p>
<p>在電燈未行前，火油燈爲發光唯一之最良工具。有檯燈，有掛燈，白磁其罩，黃銅爲飾，花紋鏤刻亦絕精細，故頗美觀。因火油卽爲日用所必需，而其供給又操於洋商之手，在光緒季年，火油曾一度爲囤積投機之目標，當時各報行市中，火油行市亦其一也，以是傾家敗業者亦不少。</p>
<p>火油之名與用途，中國古代早有見及，新五代史古城國傳有云：</p>
<p>「周顯德五年，占城國王，因德漫遣使者莆訶散來貢猛火油八十四瓶，薔薇水十五瓶，……猛火油以灑物，得水則出火。薔薇水得自西域，以灑衣，雖敝而香不滅」。</p>
<p>所謂猛火油，即今之火油，殆米經提煉耳！至是火油已有流行於中國，故宋康譽之所撰昨夢錄有云：</p>
<p>一西北邊城防城庫，皆掘地作大池，縱橫丈餘，以蓄猛火油，不閱月，池土皆赤黃，又別爲池而徙焉，不如是，則火自屋柱延燒矣。猛火油者，聞出於高麗之東數千里，日初出之時，因盛夏日力，烘石極熱則出液，他物遇之即爲火，惟眞瑙璃器可貯之。中山府治西有大陂池，郡人呼爲海子。余猶記郡帥就之，以按水戰，試猛火油。池之別岸爲胡人營壘，用油者以油涓滴，自火熖中過，則烈焰遽發，頃刻胡營凈盡，油之餘力入水，藻荇俱盡，魚鼈遇之皆死」　。</p>
<p>此言猛火油之作用，固與今之火油無相異也。其餘言安南出猛火油者，史書中亦有見之，要知安南與占城，在今視之，固爲一地也’地也。其他雜記中有云：</p>
<p>「猛火油樹津，出佛打泥國，大類樟腦，第能腐人肌肉，燃置水中，光燄愈熾，蠻夷以制火器，其鋒甚烈，帆檣樓櫓，運延不止，則雖魚鼈，遇者無不爐爍」。</p>
<p>此則非油，而爲一種樹脂，能發大火，遂以猛火油擬之也。</p>
<p>但在古代，亦知其爲礦物，故有石油之說。如云：</p>
<p>一鄜延境內有石油，舊說，高奴縣出脂水，即此也·生於水際沙石，與泉水相雜，惘惘而出，土人以雉尾挹之，乃探入缶中，頗似淳漆，燃之如麻，但烟甚濃，所霑屋幕皆黑一。</p>
<p>蓋此所云，猶爲粗劣之石油，而其產地，即今陝甘產石油之處也。</p>
<p>自煤油流行，而洋鐵畚箕，乃爲應時之產物。蓋中國舊時所用之畚箕，非竹篾編成，即爲木製，自火油箱對角剖成各半，可爲畚箕二，較竹木爲經用，不期然而遂爲日常家用之品。又有將火油鐵箱兩具，合製一箱，以藏衣物，近且專有以鍍鋅白鐵製造矣。向來中國植物油用簍裝，或用巨變，近年上海油店家，出售生油豆油，亦多用火油聽裝，大者則用大鐵桶裝，因之油之行市，亦分三種，一爲每百斤價（或爲每斤價）一爲每元可買若干，另一則爲每聽售若干，大的一聽之油重量，司馬秤爲二十八斤，市秤爲三十二左右。</p>
<p>火油之馬口鐵箱，呼之爲「聽」，蓋從Ｔin字相迻譯，Tin者固亦用以稱馬口鐵所製之器具，故餅乾等以馬口鐵匣罐相裝者亦曰聽，如一聽餅乾，一聽火油之類皆是也。</p>

<h3>談與趣</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>親愛的小弟弟及小妹妹們！今天我要跟各位來談與趣的問題，我所要說的雖然稱不上金玉良言，但是如果你們肯接受，斷不會沒有什麽收穫的。</p>
<p>「讀書時候讀書，游戲時候游戲」那二句西諺吿訴我們凡事不論讀書或游戲都須有專心，明瞭了這二句話後，進一層更應該知道——游戲須注意興趣，讀書則絕對不可受興趣的支配。不是嗎？因爲求興趣而游戲，所以游戲須注意興趣；可是，讀書可以說會求興趣而讀書嗎？卽然，不會求興趣而讀書，那麽讀書就不必顧到興趣？也並不。十個小朋友中有八個對於算術一門功課，常常不能獲得圓滿的成績，大半是由於小朋友們對於算術不發生興趣的緣故。讓興趣幫助讀書，然而不是讓興趣支配讀書。你們有一個通病，拿到一本書，不管有無意義，祗要內容精彩或插圖豐富，就有興趣來讀。反之，怎樣一本有意義的書，如果沒有插圖或材料乏味，你們就感到掃興；這樣的讀書還可說是不受興趣的支配麽？在有意義的書本上創造興趣，智識才會日增，讀書才將有飛速的進步，希望各位小朋友能够循此途不斷努力！</p>
<h3>怎樣向爸媽要錢</h3>
<p>— 左蕙</p>
<p>向爸媽要錢，常會遭到拒絕的，小朋友們，你們以爲爸媽總是這樣的不懂道理嗎？我想，你們自己該懂得些向爸媽要錢的法門才好呢！</p>
<p>我常常看到許多小朋友聚在校門口的販子旁邊，買一些齷齪的蔴菇，魷魚咀嚼着，要知道，這些閒食是對你們的身子有害的呢，那末做爸媽的爲了愛惜你們，他們還肯隨意的把錢給你們嗎？所以，向爸媽要錢，第一是不要買閒食吃，討錢的時候還得好好地把理由說明，爸媽看你們說得頭頭是道，他們那裏還會拒絕！不過，理由是不可以濫造的，因爲你哄騙了爸媽一决，第二决給爸媽發覺了，以後他們再也不會給你們錢了呵！</p>
<p>也有些人家比較窮一些的，那末做孩子的更應該知道爸媽的苦楚，體諒着爸媽，不要和別的富家孩子一樣，在功課上更應該埋頭用功，這樣爸媽深愛了你們，當你們偶然要錢的時候，爸媽是沒有不答應的。</p>
<p>還有，當爸媽在發怒的時候，那末小朋友們千萬不可伸出手來；否則，不但沒有錢給你們，也許遝會把你們惡狠狠的駡一頓，那時，雖然你要錢是爲了正當的用處，也無從說起的了。</p>
<h3>幼時習禱的孔夫子　（民華制圖）</h3>
<h3>自私的巨人</h3>
<p>— 其琛</p>
<p>從前有一個自私的巨人，他有一座美麗的大花園。裏面有美麗的花，碧綠的草，高大的樹，歌唱的烏，採蜜的蜂。每天下午放學後，總有無數的小孩前去遊玩。</p>
<p>不幸得很！有一天，這個自私的巨人回來了。他看見了這許多的小孩，在他的花園裏玩耍。於是把他們趕了出來，並且在四週造了一座大牆，更是在大門口竪立了一面吿白牌，上面寫着：「入內必究一」。</p>
<p>春天到了！各處都是開着花，非常美麗，但是只有這個花園仍舊是冬天，花草都不生長，小烏也不唱歌。白雪滿舖着這個花園，樹枝上好像噴過銀似的，都是落的霜，風也狂暴的吼着。</p>
<p>「爲什麽春不到我這花園裏來？」自私的巨人常望着他的花園，嘆着氣：「最好天氣會改變一下子！」</p>
<p>但是，非但春不到來；就是秋，夏也不到來。永遠是冬天：風，霜，雪。</p>
<p>有一天早上，他剛在牀上醒來，忽然有一種非常美妙的音樂，在他的花園裏。「哦！我知道春到底是會來的！」他喜歡的跳了起來，走到窗前去看。</p>
<p>他看見了一個小洞在高牆上，許多小孩，一個個的爬進來。園內的每一棵樹上坐着一個小孩。樹上開滿了花，地上長滿了草，許多小烏，在樹上飛飛唱唱，羣蜂也在忙碌的採蜜——眞的春是到了！</p>
<p>於是他才知道了爲什麼從前春總是不來。「我要打倒這高牆！並且開放花園的前門！」他喊着跑進了花園。許多小孩看見這個巨人來了，便大家一起跑了，這整個的花園又成了冬天。</p>
<p>等到他把高牆打倒，前門開放以後，許多小孩於是又進來了。園內忽然又變成了春天。</p>
<p>「這個花園是永遠屬於你們的了！孩子們！」自私的巨人喊着，和孩子們一起開始玩了。這個花園於是又像從前般的美麗了。</p>
<h3>踢毽子比賽觀感</h3>
<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>古拔路的存德中小學，在上海可算是一個辦得很好的私立學校，校長須文祥先生，對於校務的促進，不遺餘力。所以近年來求學的靑年，聞風前往者，日見增加。而最近該校爲提倡踢毽子運動起見，前天又舉行一次全校踢毽子比賽，很有趣味。筆者特地走去參觀，所以這裏，把觀感所及，寫一些在下面。</p>
<p>那天早上，踢毽子比賽在八時半就舉行，每級選出的代表，男女各五人。由該校體育敎師担任評判，每人踢兩次。這些學生，對於踢毽子，經過兩個月的練習，已很純熟，什麽盤，拐，反踢肉面，都能把毽子很靈滑的玩在手上或脚上。但比賽爲求簡單起見，祗比打跳一項。在踢毽子的花樣裏面，打跳最難，可是結果，初中一有學生某，竟連打幾十跳。所以男女錦標，皆爲中一所得。大概人愈小，踢起來愈活潑，因而比較大些的中二三的同學，反踢不過中一呢！</p>
<p>據該校當局所表示者，這决所以提倡踢鍵子，因爲看到在冬天，踢毽子是一種最好的運動。踢的時候，全身運動，有益健康當非淺鮮。而且就是大冷的日子，幾脚毽子一踢，就會全身發暖。尤其像他們學校裏，操塲不十分大，學生戲弄球類，每易打碎玻璃或踢痛人，至於踢毽子，就不會有這種事情發生。即使毽子有時落在人的頭上，也並不十分痛。我聽了這一番話，覺得踢毽子的確是合於冬天的運動而値得提倡的，望小朋友們大家不要忽略這種有益的運動。</p>
<h3>許多金錢</h3>
<p>— 古巴</p>
<p>從前有一個農夫，他生有三個很懶惰的兒子，一天，那農夫快要死了，毫不遲疑的喚三個兒子在側，吿訴他們有很多金錢藏在田中，他說：「你們去墾田，便能在泥土中找出它們。」三個兒子聽了這話，便興奮的問父親藏錢的地方，他們想不費一些力，而成一富翁，但是他們的父親只回答他們說：「墾田去」。</p>
<p>父親既死，三個兒子把他埋葬後，便匆匆往田中去努力掘土，那些鄰近的農人，對這三個孩子的舉動，都發生驚奇。以為起先不鋤寸土的他們，何以如此勞動起來，他們在土中拾起每塊石子，都拿來丟掉。掘了很久的時間，却沒有一些金錢的踪跡，他們想：他們的勞力的白費了。</p>
<p>當下一年的時候，他們在田中的收穫，超出了過去的記錄，而且比任何那個農田來得豐收，這時候他們纔明白他們父親的意思，他們覺悟到惟有勤懇工作才能獲得金錢，懶惰的孩子是決不能成爲富翁的。</p>
<p>他們從此不再懶惰了，他們在每季中都勉力耕作，每一年他們的收獲較全國鄉村來得優越，而他們自己出成了很强壯的漢子。</p>
<h3>小學生暑期作業競賽初級第四名　我的父親</h3>
<p>— 湘姚小學　步慕芳</p>
<p>我家是半耕半讀的人家，父親喜歡讀書，也會種田，他性情很和藹，終日面現笑容。</p>
<p>他生平最喜歡的是種植樹木，瓜果，飼養家禽。</p>
<p>我家屋子的四面，地上長着的桃杏等樹，都是父親手植的，每當春季百花開放的時候，將屋子團在中心；樹底下的鷄鴨很淸閒地遊行着，父親看見再高興不過了。</p>
<p>他對捉樹蟲，鋸樹枝，喂禽食都喜歡自己動手，從來不肯去役使他人，村中偶有小小爭論，也要他去勸解，所以他一天到晚也很忙碌，人家叫他休息，他總說：「我喜歡做，並不覺</p>
<p>八一三事變後，我們鄉　擾亂不堪，父親無法。只好離開了心愛的家園，移居到上海來。但是上海的生活環境，都和父親的性情不合；况且他本是好動的人，到上海以後，終日空閒，只好無聊地看看書籍。</p>
<p>他心中的苦悶，我們可以在他難得發現笑容的面上知道。他唯一的希望就是能够快些回到家裏，再用心力去整迎田園。</p>

<h3>推荐「路透傳」</h3>
<p>— 連泰</p>
<p>這部片子不但是我們新聞界工作人員值得去欣賞一下，而且也是每個人做事情的時候的最好的座右銘——因為路透叫你對於任何一種工作應當抱了百折不撓的精神和不怕譏笑的嚴肅的態度去幹。路透對他的愛妻，對他的同事以及最後一個高潮在法庭中的時候都是這樣的，因為他有把握地瞭解一件事情。</p>
<p>不論現在英國的路透通訊社是成為官方消息機關了，也不論這機關被利用為政治鬥爭上的工具了，可是當初喬利·路透氏並不含有陰險的野心，或是想出風頭，或是想發一批財，這從路透對銀行家倫道夫幾次三番的談話中可以看出的，他又曾對他愛妻說：「為了大眾」要把林肯被刺的消息宣佈出去，同時在法庭上時曾說：「自由的民眾應當擁有能自由發言的報紙」。</p>
<p>路透氏又再三地說過，報道消息務須正確而迅速，並以為新聞事業是一種神聖的工作。</p>
<p>我很希望新聞界同人都有這種精神，更希望每個人能具有不怕失敗和不怕嘲笑的態度。</p>
<p>最後值得提起的是威廉台德爾導演的手法，他是好萊塢傳記片導演的怪傑，過去的作品如：「左拉傳」，「萬古流芳」，「錦繍山河」，「慾海慈航」等。至於本片的配音者史汀納也是值得我們稱讚的，使本片有良好的音響效果。</p>

<h3>殷秀岑加入藝華</h3>
<p>— 星谷</p>
<p>在白虹正式脫離國聯，加入金星後，接着是梅熹·孫敏等亦走出了國聯公司，現在又有殷胖子（秀岑）於國聯合同期滿，也預備不再繼訂，而另謀發展了。</p>
<p>按殷胖子自入影圈，迄今已十載整。他是北平人，聯華公司赴平設第五分廠招考電影人材養成所時，胖子報名投考，僥倖錄取後，始正式投身銀幕。</p>
<p>躍登銀幕之首部作為「故宮新怨」，殷秀岑以二百八十五磅的體重飾一滑稽反派角，「故宮新怨」完成，即來滬進入聯華一廠。戰後，加入新華，攝有「乞丐千金」「冷月詩魂」等片。</p>
<p>殷秀岑在歷來各影片的演出，確是很令人滿意，認為是一個頗能演戲的演員，然而，他在天才，一向被導演埋沒着，不能盡量發揮，所以想另謀發展。</p>
<p>最初，是藝華公司方面，由王龍接洽，如殷秀岑聯合韓蘭根·洪警鈴·章志直四人同進藝華，則藝華願以一千五百元代價作為四人月薪，每拍片一部，酬勞另給。然而事實上，韓蘭根在國聯負重要職，勢必不能脫離新華加入藝華，故藝華很有意單獨羅致殷秀岑，同時殷秀岑也很願意轉入藝華，近日正為月薪事，進行談判中，意見很接近。不過殷與新華之合同尙有一星期，故與藝華簽約須在一星期後，大致這件事是不會再發生變故的。</p>

<h3>US Congress to Pass Bill: Extensive Aid to Democratic Nations; Roosevelt's Proposal Includes Five Items; Public Believes This Action Is Equivalent to Repealing Neutrality Laws</h3>
<p>Washington - It is believed here yesterday that the administration's unprecedented bill to aid China, Britain, Greece, and other democratic nations will be submitted to Congress today. The bill includes a provision allowing British warships to be repaired in American shipyards. In addition, another provision declares that such steps will not be affected by other laws and regulations. Authoritative sources believe this action is equivalent to repealing the Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act. According to this provision, the United States can lend munitions, exchange national defense information with foreign countries, and damaged warships of belligerent nations can also stay in American ports. It is widely believed that the bill can be passed in the short term. The bill is called the "Act to Enhance American Defense." It stipulates that "the US President, when he" deems it beneficial to the country's defense, may disregard other legal conflicts and authorize the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Army, and other ministers to carry out the following matters at any time: (1) order military factories to manufacture various munitions to supply any country that President Roosevelt deems relevant to American national defense; (2) transfer any national defense supplies to this government by means of sale, transfer, exchange, lease, loan, or gift; (3) inspect, examine, modify, repair, or replace national defense supplies for other governments; (4) exchange national defense intelligence with foreign governments; (5) permit the export of national defense supplies. The so-called national defense supplies are "any weapons, ammunition, aircraft, ships, machinery, equipment, tools, raw materials, or industrial supplies, and work-related items." The bill authorizes the President to exchange unique national defense plans and drafts with other governments. In addition, it stipulates that these governments shall not transfer the acquired materials to others without the President's permission. This contract should also fully respect the private trademark rights of the American people. President Roosevelt said at a press conference that he personally did not hope to acquire the powers stipulated in the bill, but "it is obvious that someone must acquire this power." He said that if the US policy is to help democratic countries continue to survive, it must increase the legal speed. The President declined to predict how much it would cost to implement these plans. He said that the new bill would not amend the Johnson Act. The Johnson Act stipulates that credit loans should be refused to countries that have not paid their war debts. It is said that the new bill's "disregard of other legal provisions" is to avoid conflicts with the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act. The President said that if the new bill is delayed in Congress for a week, the delivery of important raw materials from the United States to democratic countries in July will also be delayed by at least a week. He said that before Congress concludes the discussion on foreign-made munitions in US government military factories or shipyards, he is not prepared to submit a real budget request to Congress. Senator Barkley, a Democrat from Kentucky, is the person who will submit this bill to the Senate. Representative McCormack, a Democrat from Maryland, represents the House of Representatives in submitting it. McCormack said, "This means that we should manufacture supplies for our friends as if they were for ourselves." He also said that the bill would allow the United States to purchase raw materials lacking in the United States from American republics, Canada, and other countries that are important to American national defense. At the same time, Roosevelt told reporters that the export registration system for American copper, zinc, brass, bronze, nickel, and charcoal would take effect on February 1. The President also said that the US Export Control Agency will soon decide whether to issue permits, as it has done before for many important raw materials. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Vital National Weapons: US to Provide Equipment and Repairs</p>
<p>Washington - Administration leaders yesterday submitted President Roosevelt's proposal to aid democratic countries to the Senate and House of Representatives. The proposal advocates: (1) the President may, when he deems it beneficial to national defense, manufacture or procure in arsenals or factories or shipyards under US jurisdiction any defensive equipment required by any government, and the defense of that country is regarded by the President as being related to the security of US defense; (2) the President may sell or transfer, or lease, or lend any defensive equipment to any of the aforementioned governments; (3) the President may test or repair, or equip, or organize any defensive equipment for any of the aforementioned governments; (4) the President may notify any of the aforementioned governments of any national defense information regarding any defensive equipment specified in Section 2; (5) the President may release any defensive equipment for delivery to any of the aforementioned governments. Congressional leaders also issued a document explaining the provisions of Section 3 regarding testing or repairs, stating that defensive equipment, whether manufactured in the United States or not, can be repaired in the United States. For example, the British battlecruiser Renown can also be repaired at the US Brooklyn Navy Shipyard, and the President must consider this to be in the interests of US national defense. This section has a broad meaning. Any US sea, land, and air base can repair or equip its weapons for any country whose defense is related to the security of US defense. This case is called the Aid to Britain Act, and it approves the necessary amount of funding to implement its provisions, estimated to be 100 million yuan. Senator Barkley, the Senate administration leader, explained the national defense information section in this case, saying that this section authorizes the President to consider using all drawings, drafts, or other information for special equipment. This information is only applicable to the defensive equipment supplied to foreign countries under this case, and the government can order defensive equipment for foreign governments, limited to what is available to the US Army and Navy. The Aid to Britain Act transforms the President's policy of making the United States the arsenal of democratic countries into a legal form, and implements the President's promise to deliver an increasing number of ships, aircraft, tanks, and cannons to democratic countries. This case allows the United States to supply various weapons to countries whose defense is deemed by the President to be related to the security of US defense. The document issued by congressional leaders explained that the President may permit the export of national defense equipment, stating that the ban on the export of certain military supplies in 1940 has been terminated as a result. However, this section does not stipulate that US ships be used to transport these weapons to the battlefield. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>US to Issue New Ban Again: Restricting Exports of Copper, Zinc, Nickel, etc.</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday vigorously emphasized to reporters the importance of rapid action to lease weapons to democratic countries, saying that the broad powers given by the Aid to Britain Act are indeed needed, so that rapid action can be taken. He has now signed a proclamation stating that from February 1, purple copper, white copper, brass, zinc, nickel, and potassium carbonate must be licensed before they can be exported. When reporters asked whether this matter involved the loan of destroyers, the President replied that no one had made such a suggestion. The President also said that the allocation of funds could be divided into two parts, one for immediate use and the other for preparation for future orders. A congressional leader told people after the meeting that this case could be sent to the President for signing within a month or five weeks. Other leaders seemed to believe that this case could be passed quickly, but they also knew that there would be some opposition in Congress, especially the Senate. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - The "Aid to Britain Bill" is receiving the majority of support, as expected. When this case was presented in the House of Representatives, more than a dozen members stood up to criticize it. When it was presented in the Senate, Senator McKellar spoke, calling Hitler a "devil in human form." Isolationist Senator Clark said that this case allows President Roosevelt to "declare war" and will become a totalitarian government in domestic affairs. Members had differing opinions on whether this case was sufficiently thorough to approve US ships carrying military supplies to Britain or the Allied countries. Another member of the House said, "This is a step to push us towards totalitarianism. It is war, not peace." Senator McKellar proposed that all laws that would interfere with our giving Britain the assistance deemed necessary by the President or Congress should be repealed." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman George declared that under the provisions of the Aid to Britain Bill, US Navy ships will not be able to escort merchant ships to Europe. The draft of the bill has been amended to make this point clearer. This case will be considered by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday. Isolationist senators met on Friday night to discuss ways to defeat this case, but the general opinion is that they will only be able to obtain a minority and opposing vote. It is heard that many senators who intend to vote in favor of this case will try to impose some restrictions on the powers granted to the President. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>US Rapidly Expanding Navy: Ready to Support National Policy at Any Time; New Commander-in-Chief Issues Remarks: Will Continue to Deploy Warships in the Future</h3>
<p>Washington - Rear Admiral Kimmel, who will succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet on February 1, said yesterday that he will do his best to improve the effectiveness of the fleet and support national policy at any time. When he met with reporters yesterday, he declined to publish a definitive plan to bring the fleet to full readiness. His only answer was, "We have deployed warships in the past, and we will do so in the future." He said that he was surprised by the new appointment, so he did not discuss any detailed naval procedures. However, he said, "The US Navy is currently expanding rapidly in order to reach full strength. We are now building new ships, assembling officers and soldiers, and arming them. The new Pacific and Atlantic fleets recently pointed out and created by the President are indicators of the expansion of the Navy. You can be confident that I will continue to advance the work of my predecessors in the future, so that I can support national policy at any time when the government orders." (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Manila - Rear Admiral Bemis arrived here yesterday on the Clipper plane. A brief ceremony was held at 9:00 this morning to take office as Commander of the US Sixteenth Naval District. The former Admiral Smaley left office due to returning to the United States for medical treatment. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>US to Ask Britain to Help with Expenses: To Manufacture Military Supplies</p>
<p>Washington - Senior officials here said that the government authorities, in order to ensure the smooth passage of the "Aid to Britain Bill" through Congress, have agreed to announce that Britain may be asked to help pay for the various military supplies received. It has been proposed that Britain should store about 200 million US dollars of assets in the United States as additional collateral for these military supplies. This 300 million yuan is the value of British real estate in the United States and various British companies operating in the United States. These assets will be placed in US government agencies as collateral. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>US Representative and British Prime Minister Discuss Far East Situation: US Determined to Help China; Britain to Strengthen Resistance to Japanese Pressure</h3>
<p>Washington - Diplomatic sources recently said that the lending procedures in the US Pacific Defense Enhancement Bill are of broad importance, and China is also mentioned in the bill as one of the democratic countries that the United States is determined to help. Observers here are particularly concerned about the remarks made by Hopkins, President Roosevelt's special envoy to London. Hopkins said that the United States is doing its best to produce military supplies for Britain, the United States, China, and Greece. Far Eastern diplomats speculate that Hopkins, British Prime Minister Churchill, and even Foreign Secretary Eden must have discussed the situation in the East. Some people say that this factor may constitute an important part of Hopkins' mission. It is feared that Britain may strengthen its resistance to Japanese pressure in the future. Britain's position in the Bermuda Customs incident can be seen as an indication of the strength of the steps taken by Britain. British customs officials in Bermuda recently detained all the property of Japanese passengers traveling to Germany, and the British authorities in London also recognized that the actions of the Bermuda customs officials were within their authority. Diplomatic sources here also believe that Hopkins must have discussed with Britain the US use of British bases in the Pacific. Among the bases, the most prominent one, Singapore, has been extensively surveyed by Britain, the United States, and Australia. It is particularly noteworthy that Australia and the United States have recently exchanged naval attachés, which is an unprecedented initiative. Diplomatic circles also said that the general public generally believes that the United States may advance in Pacific affairs in a calm and unhurried manner. These people believe that the governments of Britain, the United States, and Australia must be proceeding carefully, or even secretly, in order to avoid any situation that could cause disputes. The reason for this is (1) US isolationists are not yet prepared to take responsibility for Pacific issues outside of Hawaii; (2) to avoid excessively stimulating Japan. US policy is to be strongly prepared to resist any new Japanese aggression near Singapore, but at the same time, it also wants to avoid any aggressive actions. Most authoritative sources believe that if the United States and Britain reach an agreement on the use of Singapore, Japan may launch a military retaliation at all costs. Therefore, diplomatic experts unanimously believe that Hopkins' remarks do not seem to have developed into a concrete agreement, but mutual understanding may have been increased regarding the various purposes that have been expressed. These people believe that the United States may not agree to use the suggestion of using Singapore as part of the repayment of the loan program. This action will not result in an increase in the hostility of the minority of isolationists in Congress. Therefore, any agreement on Singapore will not be announced until the future when Britain and the United States believe it is necessary to take strong diplomatic action against Japan, or it is strategically necessary. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Osumi Clearly States: Japan Determined to Advance South</p>
<p>Tokyo - Military Senator Admiral Osumi of the Japanese Navy recently gave an interview to a reporter from the "Asahi Shimbun" and discussed the situation in the Pacific and asked the people to study the situation in the South Seas in order to prepare for the plan to advance south. His words roughly stated that the policy of advancing south is the result of a natural desire. Because the South Seas area has a hot climate and sufficient light, people are willing to go there. If there is a nation that "obeys the natural order and seeks to advance south, there is no need to explain the reason." However, it is regrettable that the natives of the South Seas islands cannot understand our country's intentions. We have no intention of exploiting the South Seas area. What we sincerely hope is to share prosperity with other nations in East Asia. However, the natives of the South Seas are under the control of foreign forces, and these people are using various methods to prevent the natives from understanding our country's intentions. The more we show goodwill to the natives, the more uneasy these people become. At this moment, these people are buying military aircraft and warships. In fact, if they have a conflict with our country, these aircraft and warships will be of no use. As for what we call the South Seas area, what is the scope? I don't need to explain it. This area includes many places. If I list their names, some aspects will definitely be horrified. For this reason, I only say that the South Seas area refers to a place with sufficient light and a hot climate. We are now burying our heads in studying the situation in the Pacific. I dare say that this situation will soon become severe. We Japanese should overcome various difficulties to promote national fortunes. At present, our country is feeling a shortage of charcoal and rice, but this is not the time to complain, nor can we quibble over words. Generally speaking, the people of the country do not have a clear understanding of South Seas affairs. Some people's concepts are extremely vague, or even regard the South Seas as the birthplace of "Mount Tai" and the "Queen of Beasts." This is very regrettable. In short, although there are many green snakes, tigers, leopards, and other beasts in a certain place in the South Seas, flowers often bloom in other places. Our country must understand the truth about this corner. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Development of Balkan situation</h3>
<p>Just as rumors were spreading that German troops were entering Bulgaria, preparing to attack Thessaloniki, Greece, the Soviet Union suddenly signed three agreements with Germany: one was an economic agreement, stipulating that the amount of goods exchanged between the two sides in the next year and a half should be more than in the first year; the second was an agreement on the relocation of German expatriates in the three Baltic countries; and the third was a border agreement between the two sides from the Baltic Sea to the Hungarian border. A careful examination of the content of the agreements shows that they are either a continuation of old matters or simply completed diplomatic documents, and there is no new meaning or development; but the fact that they were concluded today, when Germany has decided to invade Bulgaria to aid Italy, is certainly not a coincidence, but rather a planned action on the diplomatic front before Hitler launches a military offensive in the Balkans.</p>
<p>According to a report from the capital of Romania yesterday, German troops have almost entered the border, but the accuracy of this report remains to be verified. Assuming that the internal affairs of the above-mentioned agreement signed between Germany and the Soviet Union do include a compromise in which Moscow tolerates German troops passing through Bulgaria, one cannot help but ask: since the Soviet Union persuaded Bulgaria not to join the Axis powers at the end of November last year, why is it now willing to tolerate German troops entering Bulgaria to threaten its own gateway to the Black Sea—the Dardanelles Strait? Isn't this a contradiction? There seem to be only two possible answers to this question. One is that Hitler has given the Soviet Union a considerable price, enough to make the realistic Moscow authorities change their original intention of not wanting the war to affect Bulgaria. The second is that Stalin has felt threatened by the entry of 300,000 German troops into Romania and has to weigh the importance of things and distinguish between what is urgent and what is not in order to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war himself. According to the first hypothesis, Bulgaria may be about to encounter the second fate of Poland, that is, the Soviet Union takes its eastern half adjacent to the Black Sea and Turkey to ensure the "security" of the straits, while Germany controls its western half as a passage for German troops to go straight to Greece. As for the second hypothesis, it is true that, as this newspaper discussed a few days ago, Germany has seen through Moscow's weakness of not wanting to fight with real strength, so it is willing to submit itself. In the future, under the condition that Germany gives considerable guarantees, it can only pretend to be deaf and dumb and continue its so-called "neutral and observant" policy to wait for new opportunities to arise.</p>
<p>Since we are troubled by the lack of information, for the time being, we will not discuss the truth behind the German-Soviet agreement; because the whole story will come to light once Germany launches its next military offensive. What is worth discussing at present is, if Germany, as the rumors say, passes through Bulgaria to capture Greece, what impact will the Eastern Mediterranean war situation have? Looking at the map, it is not difficult to see that the territory of eastern Greece is just a long and narrow coastal strip. If Hitler uses mechanized troops and a large number of air forces to attack from Bulgaria in a blitzkrieg manner, it is naturally a matter of great concern whether the Greek army can resist. But on the other hand, Germany also has many unfavorable factors: first, the possibility of German troops passing through Bulgaria is not a new problem, but an old problem of the past three months. This, of course, the British-Greek allied forces have already anticipated. Therefore, it is believed that there must have been considerable arrangements in the Thessaloniki area. Once something happens, not only is it expected that the British army will be able to land and assist in the battle very quickly, but also the British navy and air force may have already made considerable arrangements. Therefore, in this regard, the British-Greek allied forces are in a state of waiting for work, and they will not be helpless against the German troops who come from afar. Second, Turkey has repeatedly declared that if Bulgaria joins the war, it will not hesitate to assist Greece in the war. Although Turkey's attitude may still be subject to Moscow's intentions in the future, its powerful army is ultimately a possible formidable enemy of Germany, and cannot be ignored by Hitler. Third, the war on both sides of the Mediterranean is almost approaching a situation of utter defeat. The "sea control" of the Mediterranean is now completely in the hands of the British Navy. Even if German troops enter Greece, it will still be difficult to shake the "sea control" of the British. In the event that the war cannot be developed as quickly as desired and falls into a stalemate again, then as time drags on, the British-Greek allied forces may, with the intensified assistance of the United States, obtain air supremacy in the Mediterranean in addition to sea control. In this way, not only will Italy become a turtle in a jar, but Germany will have just added another battlefield and dispersed its entire strength.</p>
<p>In short, Hitler must make a "desperate bet" before the Mediterranean war situation becomes hopeless, that is, before Britain firmly grasps both sea and air control. This was expected by the world long ago. Judging from the situation in the past few days, his claws seem to be aimed at the Balkans, and the Moscow authorities seem to be about to have another "watching" or "biased neutrality" that is not easy to understand. However, it can be asserted that future developments will not stop here. As for the three new agreements signed between the Soviet Union and Germany, at this moment, they naturally maintain the appearance of harmony between the Soviet Union and Germany, and are undoubtedly a diplomatic achievement of Hitler. However, they have not placed any new constraints or obligations on the Soviet Union. Everything, everything, must develop with the war situation in the future and evolve until the already destined ending—that is, the ending of the victory of public justice.</p>

<h3>Improving Soviet-German Friendship: Signing of Three New Agreements; Trade Volume Between the Two Countries to Increase; Igorka River to Baltic Sea Defined as New Border</h3>
<p>Berlin: Three agreements to adjust German-Soviet relations were signed yesterday in Moscow. One is an economic agreement, one is an agreement to relocate German nationals from the three Baltic states, and one is an agreement to demarcate the German-Soviet border from the Baltic states to the Hungarian border. The new economic agreement stipulates the trade volume between the two countries up to August 1942, which is much larger than the first agreement. The German national relocation agreement is the result of recent talks between German and Soviet representatives in Riga and Kaunas. According to the agreement, voluntary relocation by nationals can be carried out within two and a half months after signing. The border agreement is as described above. (November 11, Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials stated regarding this matter that while rumors are rife, saying that German-Soviet relations are gradually deteriorating, we have not stood idly by, but have made the most of our time to strengthen the friendship and unity between Germany and the Soviet Union. This is truly a great victory for Germany. (November 11, Huitong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Economic Agreement Contents</p>
<p>Moscow: A communique released here today states that Germany and the Soviet Union have established a new economic agreement. Economic negotiations between the two countries began at the end of October last year and concluded on January 10 this year. The two countries have now concluded a more extensive economic agreement. The Soviet signatory was the Minister of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and the German signatory was Dr. Schnurre, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The new agreement is based on the German-Soviet economic agreement of February 11, 1940, and will promote the implementation of the economic plans of the two governments in 1929. The new agreement also adjusts the total trade volume between Germany and the Soviet Union, with a validity period extended to August 1, 1942. The agreement also stipulates that the Soviet Union will transport industrial raw materials, oil, and food (grains) to Germany, while Germany will transport industrial machinery to the Soviet Union. The quantity of goods transported will exceed the standards stipulated in the first year of the agreement's implementation. During the negotiations, both sides, based on the friendly relations between the two countries, promoted the signing of the new agreement in a spirit of mutual understanding and trust. Economic issues arising from the incorporation of new areas into the Soviet Union were also resolved in accordance with the interests of both countries. (November 11, TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin: Political circles in Berlin said today that the new German-Soviet economic agreement is "the greatest economic agreement signed between the two countries," with a cargo value reaching 1 billion marks. Grains are the largest component, with an amount previously unheard of in international agreements. Mineral oil, fuel oil, gasoline, lubricating oil, and similar goods also account for a large part. The amount of Soviet cotton transported to Germany is also extremely large, and manganese ore is also an important commodity. All goods transported by Germany to the Soviet Union are industrial machinery. (November 11, Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Border Agreement Terms</p>
<p>Moscow, January 10: Soviet government representative Vyacheslav Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and German government representative, Ambassador Schulenburg, signed a new border agreement here. The new border, from the Igorka River to the Baltic Sea, was determined after Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union. The terms of the agreement are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The German-Soviet border at the above-mentioned location is from the Igorka River, where border pillar No. 1-1 was erected in 1940 when the two countries demarcated the border and distributed national interests, located in the northwest direction of the Baltic coast. The new border passes through the following locations: (a) from border pillar No. 1-1 along the former border between Lithuania and Latvia (the Lithuanian-Latvian border was determined based on the resolution of the bilateral conference on March 15, 1912) to the point where the former borders of Germany, Lithuania, and Latvia meet; (b) from the above-mentioned junction point, along the former border between Germany and Lithuania (the German-Lithuanian border was determined by the agreement between the two countries on January 28, 1928) directly to the former Memel area border; (c) from the southern end of the former Memel area, along the former border between Lithuania and Germany (this border was determined in accordance with Article 1 of the German-Lithuanian Agreement of March 22, 1939) to the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>(2) The border terms of the German-Soviet Agreement of August 31, 1940, apply to all legal border relations on the border stipulated in Article 1 of this agreement.</p>
<p>(3) The contracting parties agree to consider the legal maritime area issues on the border during continued negotiations.</p>
<p>(4) This agreement must be ratified by both parties. The exchange of ratification documents shall be held in Berlin in the near future. The above agreement shall take effect upon signing. The agreement consists of two copies (in German and Russian). The Soviet representative was Molotov, and the German representative was Schulenburg. The date was January 10, 1941.

<p>Immigration Problem Solved</p>
<p>Moscow: An agreement has been signed and resolved regarding the common property rights and immigration issues of Germany and the Soviet Union in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. According to a communique released here, "In recent weeks, Soviet and German representatives held talks in Riga and Kaunas on issues such as the transfer of German citizens and German nationals from the three Soviet Republics of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia back to German territory, and the transfer of Lithuanian and Belarusian people from German territory (the former Memel and Suwalki areas) back to the Soviet Union. On January 10, 1941, these negotiations came to an end. The two sides signed an agreement in Riga and Kaunas on immigration. According to the agreement, anyone wishing to leave the country can do so within two and a half months after the signing of the agreement, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the agreement. The immigration agreements for Latvia and Estonia were also signed by Bokalov, Chairman of the Soviet Government Delegation, and Pensla, Chairman of the German Government Delegation. The Lithuanian immigration agreement was signed by Postiev, Chairman of the Soviet Government Delegation, and Nartke, the German representative. At the same time, issues related to the property rights of both parties related to immigration were also signed in Moscow. The Soviet signatory was Vishinsky, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat, and the German representative was Dr. Schnurre. (November 11, TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3>London Figures: Not Concerned; Believe Germany's Move Is Intended to Reassure Domestic Public</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that Germany's ambitious trade agreement with the Soviet Union, hoping to obtain a large amount of grains and oil in exchange for its machinery and other manufactured goods, has not been criticized by responsible parties here because they have not yet received the original text of the agreement. It is heard that the terms of the new agreement do not seem to be much different from the old one. Both sides need it in principle, with the Soviet Union being more fortunate to have a surplus of grains and oil, allowing it to export lubricants. However, it is generally believed that the amount of raw materials Germany has obtained so far may not be very large. The exact amount of Soviet raw material deliveries will depend on Germany's ability to deliver the various goods needed by the Soviet Union. In addition, there is another important factor, which is the transportation problem. If railways and other transportation cannot handle this large increase in transportation, the exchange of goods between the two countries may inevitably be delayed. Some people believe that since this new agreement does not have any novel provisions, it is surprising that the German side takes it so seriously. The German side's intention in this move is to carry out domestic propaganda to comfort the people who have been disturbed by the United States' promise to provide unlimited military supplies to aid Britain.

<h3>Berlin Self-Satisfied</h3>
<p>Berlin: The "German General News" commented on the German-Soviet trade agreement signed yesterday, and was quite self-satisfied, believing that Germany's trade policy has achieved its goals and achieved excellent results. Germany's economic system has laid a solid foundation, enough to make the British blockade policy's extravagant hopes fall apart. (November 11, Huitong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Moscow: Today's "Pravda" commented that since Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression treaty in August 1939, the relations between the two countries have always been progressing in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding. (November 11, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Envoy: Issues Statement; This Trip Bears a Major Mission; Stay in Britain Up to Four Weeks</h3>
<p>London: Roosevelt's personal representative to Britain, Hopkins, spoke to British journalists yesterday, saying that he has a very important mission. He has met with Eden and Halifax, and had dinner with Churchill, and the conversation lasted for quite a long time, 90 minutes longer than he expected. He is here as the US President's personal representative to meet with the British Prime Minister and other central government officials to discuss events of great importance to both the United States and Britain. He will stay in Britain until the matter is completed, for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. When reporters asked where victory would belong, Hopkins replied that he had no doubts about the outcome of the war. US arms production will reach its peak by the end of this year and the beginning of next year. The United States is now making a concerted and complete effort to manufacture the defenses needed by the United States, Britain, China, and Greece. Apart from Britain, he does not intend to travel to other European countries, but wants to travel around Britain to inspect various necessary things. Hopkins answered various questions from journalists with dry humor. When asked about his thoughts on Wednesday night's attack, Hopkins said that what he could think of was more important than his own reaction to this blitz. As for the truth of his mission, Hopkins was unwilling to express anything, only saying that although President Roosevelt is busy with affairs, he is very healthy, and his spirit and determination remain unchanged, which can be comforting to the British. He also said that in his opinion, Halifax's appointment as ambassador to the United States will definitely be a great success. (November 11, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>German Planes Raid Britain Under Moonlight, Concentrated Bombing of Portsmouth; British Planes Raid Key Ports in Occupied France</h3>
<p>London: After German planes carried out widespread bombing of the British Isles the night before, they resumed their usual tactics last night, concentrating their attacks on a certain coastal city in the south for several hours. (According to Berlin news, the city of Portsmouth on the southern coast of Britain, an important British naval base, has been heavily bombed by German planes since last night and into this morning. When the German Air Force launched the blitz in September last year, the city was also an important British target that suffered heavy bombing from German planes.) Portsmouth was severely attacked last night, and the fires after the bombing blazed into the sky, causing heavy losses. Bombs also fell in other places, but no one was killed. London enjoyed a peaceful moonlit night last night. German planes also flew over Liverpool and Merseyside, but did not drop bombs. (November 11, United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>London: An Air Ministry communique said that on Friday night, British planes, under the bright moonlight, raided German-occupied ports in France.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Resolves to Strengthen Air Defenses; Will Take Measures to Implement Presidential Personnel Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After Japanese Army Minister Tojo presented a report to the Cabinet, the Cabinet unanimously resolved yesterday to "strengthen Japanese air defenses." According to claims here, military moguls and financial figures have already drafted a plan to expand the Air Force. The Japanese government has decided to immediately take various measures to implement the 1941 National Mobilization Policy. (November 11, Huitong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: During a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and the Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Interior, Army Minister Tojo said that, given the current situation, the entire country of Japan must be prepared to guard against the danger of air raids. If the country is attacked by air, then the victories of the Navy and Army will be in vain. The entire country of Japan must be trained on how to act during air raids. Large cities and industrial centers are especially important and must build large cellars and widen roads. According to experience, island nations can also suffer the same air raids as the mainland. (November 11, Huitong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Representatives from the government, financial circles, and the press will hold an important meeting from the 14th to the 17th.

<h3>Sawada Issues Moderate Statement; Japan Striving to Improve Business with the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Batavia: Sawada, head of the Japanese economic delegation to the Dutch East Indies, said yesterday that the Three-Power Pact does not change Japan's attitude towards other countries. Sawada said that Nomura, known to be pro-American, was appointed as ambassador to the United States, proving Japan's willingness to have peace. He said that the responsible figures in the Japanese government are trying to avoid difficulties with the United States, Britain, and the East Indies. He claimed that Japan "has no intention of changing the map of the Far East." He said that although Japan has desires in the Far East, they cannot be realized by sending Japanese troops to the East Indies. He said that there is a general feeling that the Dutch East Indies are less welcoming to Tokyo than to other capitals. Sawada said that the elimination of misunderstandings is enough to help Japan develop in the East Indies. The trade negotiations in Batavia, since Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi returned to the country, were postponed and will be reopened after Japan's new demands are translated into English. Sawada said that these discussions will be purely economic. He said that Japan's goal is to improve business relations between Japan and the East Indies. Japan especially needs to buy minerals from Dutch territory. His main goal is to correct misunderstandings about Japan's true goals. (November 11, United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain Recruits Youth for Aviation Training; King Appointed Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>London: After the Air Minister announced yesterday the start of the youth aviation training program for 16- to 18-year-olds, the public responded enthusiastically, and inquiries never stopped all day. General Somia, commander of the training corps, said yesterday that he hopes Lancashire will recruit at least 100 teams and London 72 teams, and will use the 40 existing aviation training corps cadets as its core. Each team of young people has at least 100 people and up to 200 people, all wearing Air Force blue uniforms, similar to the uniforms of the cadets. (November 11, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>London: Air Minister Sinclair recently gave a broadcast speech on the newly established Aviation Training Corps, saying that the great achievements of the British Air Force in 1940 will occupy one of the most glorious pages in British history. The British Air Force saved Britain from defeat and gave Britain time to plan for victory. The aviation training program is an important part of planning for victory, because the British Air Force is growing and needs more drivers, pilots, gunners, and map service personnel. Its purpose is to engage in dangerous and arduous work and make noble services to the country. From now on, everyone has an equal opportunity on the way to this goal.

<h3>Japanese Emperor Orders Strict Censorship of News Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese news, the Japanese Newspaper Control Ordinance will be more strict. Today, the Japanese Emperor issued an imperial edict under Article 20 of the National Mobilization Law, which took effect immediately. The edict was proposed by the National Mobilization Conference at its meeting on December 14, advocating authorizing the Prime Minister at the Japanese headquarters, and authorizing the Governors-General of Korea and Taiwan, and the governors of Sakhalin Island and the South Pacific mandated islands, to have direct authority to censor newspapers within their jurisdictions. The business of censoring newspapers was handled by the Minister of the Interior.

<h3>European War Jottings (29): British Officer's Diary from the Western Front</h3>
<p>Last night, rumors spread that the bomber command would dispatch British aircraft to bomb Essen. The German army is penetrating deep into France, yet the bomber command is focusing on Essen. How can this possibly stem the German advance in France? The bomber command should concentrate all its efforts on destroying key crossing points over the Meuse River, disrupting the enemy's formations, and attacking the dense columns of troops advancing from east to west along the main roads. I know this is not the British Air Force's primary task, but the situation is urgent and a change of strategy is essential!</p>
<p>Today, what we hope for and pray for is unified command. There are simply too many decision-makers now, with conflicting opinions and endless disputes, making it impossible to reach a consensus. If a single dictator were to issue orders, it would be easier to achieve results.</p>
<p>Noon: Our troops have retreated again. Two divisions of German mechanized units are pursuing westward via Verdun and Boumont. The garrison at Reims has withdrawn, and we have been ordered to move further northwest to circle behind the British forces at Amiens.</p>
<p>8 PM: According to French reports, they are preparing a large-scale counter-offensive against the pocket along the Meuse River. British troops will move there tonight and then return to the Escaut River line tomorrow. We can only hope that our fighter planes can completely drive away the German bombers!</p>
<p>May 17th: The war situation is not favorable. The French Seventh Army and the British forces are hastily retreating, planning to defend a line from Antwerp and Brussels behind the Seine River to Charleroi.</p>
<p>Our troops have not launched a counter-offensive. The German army has breached the right flank of the British forces south of Brussels, creating a serious situation. The French Ninth Army is still trapped, but the First and Second Armies can launch a flanking attack against the German salient along the Meuse River.</p>
<p>May 17th, Noon: The war is worsening, and what is infuriating is that many units within the French army are not truly fighting. German armored divisions have rendered them unable to resist. This is exactly like the situation in Poland.</p>
<p>5 PM: The Air Force commandoes have departed to attack Laon, La Fère, the Oise River, and the area between Cadoux, Avennes, Verdun, Crecy, and Le Thuel. The entire area is practically a no-man's land. Only a few French troops are scattered along the Aisne River and north of it. The bridges at La Fère and Ribemont have been seized by the German army. The French have no preparations for a counter-offensive. The outcome is obvious.</p>
<p>May 18th: The news we initially hoped for is now coming in from all sides. The French army has launched a counter-offensive against the German army. General Giraud sent a battle report saying, "Fifty German light and heavy tanks have attacked our forces. We are gradually encircling and annihilating them." This is the usual formulaic language, a characteristic of the generals we rely on to stem the German offensive.</p>
<p>Although French morale has improved slightly this morning, the German army is using fifth columnists to spread various rumors from the rear, causing morale at the front to plummet again.</p>
<p>8:50 PM: We have been ordered to retreat to the forward headquarters established at Versailles-La Ferté tonight. The forward headquarters was bombed by enemy aircraft, but fortunately, General Georges and his staff had already left in time, escaping unharmed. Or perhaps this is just a rumor.</p>
<p>Enjoyed a delicious breakfast in Barracks Number One. During the last European War, this fortress was the headquarters of British Commander General French. The elegant gardens and wide stone paths exude an atmosphere of peace, making it hard to believe that the battlefield is just twenty miles away. It is truly a remarkable contrast.</p>
<p>I have read General Gamelin's moving order urging French soldiers and civilians to persevere and not retreat. Is this a repeat of history, or merely an imitation of history? I feel it is just an imitation. They want us to believe that the victory at the Marne will be repeated today, but do they themselves believe it?</p>
<p>If the French army could completely annihilate all ten German armored divisions, the enemy's attack could be stopped. The French 70-ton heavy tanks, which were touted for a while, are actually few in number. At most, only twenty have been produced. Before the German offensive began, the French army hoped to have the opportunity to use these heavy tanks to sweep away the German armored divisions. French officers boasted that they had at least a thousand heavy tanks, but now it is clear that they have far fewer than the enemy. They have fought bravely, charging into battle and advancing fearlessly, but when they encountered the heavily armored German tank units, they were helpless and ultimately collapsed completely. The German victory this time is entirely due to the combination of dive bombers and armored divisions. May 18th: We must go through the London Air Ministry to communicate with the British Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p>May 18th, 10 PM: German mechanized divisions are still rampaging, having reached Belloy-en-Santerre and Cambrai. This afternoon, an Air Force detachment bombed sixty enemy tanks with considerable success. The British and French forces are preparing to scout for concentrations of enemy mechanized units tomorrow and then destroy them in one fell swoop. The French light motorized divisions are no match for the German heavy tank units. Since there are no 70-ton heavy tanks, the only option is to use air attacks – at least that's what the French high command is saying.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that there are about six German armored divisions in the area of the bulge at Sedan. May 19th, 4 AM: The Air Force commander has sent me to prepare for the first sortie. Large German formations are beginning to advance east of Laon. One infantry division is stationed in Grand-Désert. German tank units have charged west of Cambrai and Belloy-en-Santerre, moving freely. The French headquarters has left Arras and is said to be moving to Beauvais. These German tank units do not have large numbers of troops following them. Within sixty miles, there are only motorized units and tank units without infantry. According to a gendarme in Arras, he saw a column of tanks coming down the road, so he stopped traffic on the cross street and waved them through. Only when they opened fire did he realize they were German tanks. This shows how fast things were moving and how unexpected the attack was. He was fortunate enough to escape with his life and tell this story. It is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>3 PM: News has arrived that German mechanized units have reached Amiens. This is like a nightmare. The British forces have been cut off. Our lines of communication have been severed. The only option for the British forces at this point is to retreat as quickly as possible. Following orders, I burned all public and private documents. I have only read about such things in tragedies, and I never dreamed that we would experience it ourselves.</p>
<p>Today, the Allied authorities held a meeting. General Dill hurriedly flew in from London. He is said to have declared that the British forces will fight to the last man and the last bullet. The French forces should be satisfied to hear this.</p>

<h3>Japan's Policies Waver and are Thrown into Disarray as the U.S. Strengthens Far East Actions; Japan's Import and Export Trade is Almost at a Standstill; Nationals of Axis Countries have also Begun to Withdraw; Foreign Nationals Arriving in Shanghai from Japan Analyze the Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>According to a certain foreign national who recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan, over the past few months, British and American nationals residing in Japan have been gradually withdrawing, either at the advice of their governments or of their own volition, fearing that if the United States and Japan were to join the European war, residing in a foreign country would not be safe. Due to this influence, and because the atmosphere of American involvement in the war has recently intensified, nationals of Axis countries residing in Japan have also begun to withdraw, although the latter is mostly due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>All Trade Will Be Lost</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the current European war, Japan's trade relations with Europe and Africa have already been severed. The only markets for Japanese merchants and foreign merchants residing in Japan are currently in the Western Hemisphere, the United States, and various South American countries. However, restrictions on U.S.-Japan trade are becoming increasingly stringent. If these two markets are blocked, Japan's import and export trade will come to a complete standstill. The United States' participation in the war is almost only a matter of time. In the future, the trade routes between the Axis countries and Japan will be under American fire, and even transportation between China and Japan will be in serious danger. At this time, Japan can only sit and wait for its doom. Therefore, the continuous withdrawal of foreign nationals residing in Japan is a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Hesitant, Uncertain, and Unable to Decide</p>
<p>The foreign national also stated that the Japanese are reaping the consequences of their own actions. Their biggest mistake was signing the alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. Initially, it was intended as a mere threat against the United States, but it unexpectedly backfired. Hardly anyone in Japan wants to go to war with the United States, and even the Japanese military leadership does not want to fight the United States, knowing that their strength is insufficient. However, they are deeply mired in a diplomatic quagmire, just as the Japanese army is deeply mired in a military quagmire. They cannot advance, and they cannot retreat.</p>
<p>The Japanese Public is Gradually Awakening</p>
<p>The Japanese people used to blindly believe in everything, but now they have begun to doubt. They are just under pressure and unable to do anything. However, they no longer trust certain propaganda. The foreign national continued that the Japanese people's dissatisfaction with the current situation has been overflowing for the past two years. In order to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey," the Japanese government often falsely accuses foreign nationals residing in Japan of malicious propaganda, obstructing the "New Order in East Asia," and espionage. Recently, a group of American school teachers arrived in Japan to investigate the real situation in the Far East. They stayed in Japan for only a few months before leaving as enthusiastically as they had arrived.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Processes Registration of British Nationals</h3>
<p>The British Consulate-General in Shanghai is now handling the registration of British nationals starting on the 4th of this month in order to conduct the annual population statistics of nationals as a matter of routine. All British nationals residing in Shanghai must bring their passports to the Passport Office of the consulate to register every day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Consul General George has issued a notice to inform all nationals.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Handwritten Instructions on Key Points for Suppressing Grain Hoarding; Hoarded Food Must Be Cleared Out by Lunar New Year's Eve; Information Discovered about Large Quantities of Siamese and Vietnamese Rice Waiting to be Transported</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is concerned about the people's suffering. Recently, in view of the soaring food prices and commodity prices, which have made the people's situation even more difficult, and the hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, which is one of the important reasons, he issued handwritten instructions at the beginning of the month, ordering all parts of the country to earnestly suppress it. These instructions contain six key measures, which have now been forwarded to Shanghai. The reporter of Ping Ming News Agency has obtained the full text as follows:</p>
<p>Deadline for Sales Before the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>(1) All stores, firms, and private individuals who have hoarded various grains, food, and essential daily necessities must sell them as much as possible by January 26th of the 30th year of the Republic (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve) to supply the market and meet the needs of the people. If it is expected that they cannot be completely sold out before this deadline and there are still remaining grains and goods in stock, they should report the remaining quantity to the food management agency or the local competent authority and continue to supply and sell them. (2) If any hoarded grains and goods are not voluntarily sold within this deadline or are not truthfully reported and registered as ordered, they will be considered as hoarding for speculation and will be punished according to military law. In addition to confiscating the grains and goods, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<p>Legitimate Merchants are Not Allowed to Close Down</p>
<p>(3) All those who sell and register in accordance with the order will be guaranteed legal profits by the government. (4) Legitimate merchants who originally operated should continue to operate as usual and are not allowed to close down, guaranteeing their legal profits in business. (5) No one is allowed to privately purchase and hoard grains and goods exceeding the quantity for daily use, in order to protect legitimate business. Those who currently have hoarded goods should handle them in accordance with the provisions of item (1) above until they are completely sold out. (6) Omitted.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice are Awaiting Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream in considerable quantities. As of the 10th of the month, a total of 13 ships had transported more than 124,100 bags, of which more than 19,100 bags were directly shipped from Haiphong, more than 6,000 bags were directly shipped from Saigon, and the rest were shipped from Hong Kong. Yesterday, another 32,515 bags arrived at the port, including 20,253 bags shipped by Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng from Hong Kong and 12,258 bags shipped by Butterfield &amp; Swire's Jia Ying from Siam. According to the shipping industry, it has recently been learned that large quantities of foreign rice from Vietnam, Siam, and Rangoon are awaiting shipment to Shanghai. As for the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, shipping companies are eagerly seeking to send ships to sail the Shanghai-Burma line, because at the beginning of the opening, the Yunnan-Burma Road was entirely for government military transport, and it was feared that passengers and cargo could not be transported inland, so they are temporarily watching. Now that the situation has improved, the Hong Yun Shipping Bureau in this city has dispatched the Tiebo Ke wheel to Rangoon directly on the 7th of this month, carrying a lot of goods. Also, Butterfield &amp; Swire's Zesheng wheel (this wheel was leased from China-India Steamship Company) departed from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month and went directly to Rangoon, also carrying a lot of goods. It is heard that when the two ships return to Shanghai, they will also load foreign rice to Shanghai. In the future, there will be no shortage of food in this city.</p>
<h3>Chinese National Spirit Grows Stronger with Each Battle; The Day of Victory is Not Far Away: Dr. Fei Wu's Words to Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dr. Fei Wu, a friend of China (who went to the United States from the Ling District to raise relief funds for China and achieved great success, recently returned to Shanghai from the United States and plans to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong today to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Ai-ling, to report on everything and then fly to Chongqing to work), visited the isolated battalion of Commander Xie Jinyuan of the 4th Regiment on Jiaozhou Road yesterday afternoon at the invitation of Commander Xie Jinyuan and reported on the general situation of free China. The reporter of Da Zhong News Agency received a notification from Commander Xie in advance and was able to witness the grand occasion and listen to Fei's great speech. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Visit to the Barracks and Brief Report</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Fei Wu, accompanied by Qingjian Huilai, Si Jun, and Mr. Song and Mr. Xiao, went to the isolated battalion. Commander Xie Jinyuan received them and accompanied them on a tour of the area. Fei praised the excellent quality of the small-scale industrial production of the isolated battalion and the brave, resolute, and lively spirit of the soldiers. He also praised the cleanliness and order of the barracks and the beauty and suitability of the various decorations. Lai Sijun also bought three pairs of socks at the cooperative as a souvenir. Then, under the leadership of Commander Xie, Fei and others went to the lecture hall to introduce themselves to the entire isolated battalion. All four hundred soldiers applauded and warmly welcomed them. First, Commander Xie made an introductory speech, briefly stating that the United States is a pillar in the anti-aggression front and that Fei is China's most sincere friend. We are very fortunate to have this good opportunity to listen to Fei's high-level discourse. Then, Fei stood up and gave a fifteen-minute report to the isolated battalion, with Mr. Song acting as the translator.</p>
<p>Praising China's Increasing Strength in Each Battle</p>
<p>Fei first stated, "I am very honored to be able to speak with you in the same room. When I was in the United States, I met a Ms. Yang who told me about the heroic battles of the isolated battalion, which often made me yearn for them." He continued, "During the three years of the sacred war, I personally experienced the situation in Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places and was responsible for relief work for wounded soldiers with Mr. Huang Renlin. Therefore, I was able to see the brave fighting spirit of the Chinese soldiers and civilians. The national spirit that grows stronger with each battle can be summed up in one word: 'unbeatable'. I am deeply gratified to be able to fulfill my personal responsibility under the heroic collective of this 'unbeatable' spirit." Fei concluded, "You are all valuable cells of China's resistance and reconstruction. The day of victory is not far away. I believe that you will soon be able to return to your original positions." After Fei finished his report, Mr. Song introduced Fei's history to the isolated battalion, saying that Fei's efforts for China were enough to shame those who only paid lip service. Finally, Fei and Commander Xie took a photo together and the meeting ended.</p>
<p>Great Success in Raising Funds in the United States</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Livelihood of Workers and Eliminating Labor-Management Disputes; The Municipal Federation Urges Increasing Benefits as Much as Possible; All Labor Disputes in Various Industries will be Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>Shanghai's commodity prices are soaring, threatening the livelihood of four million citizens. The working class, unable to make ends meet, is in an even more miserable situation. The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city, given that the lunar New Year's Eve is approaching and commodity prices are even more abnormal, and that businesses decide on the advancement and retreat of employees at the end of the year, issued a letter to various industries, urging them to earnestly maintain the livelihood of employees and help them overcome difficulties. It stated that Shanghai's environment is harsh, and we are all in the same boat. Many workers in various industries work diligently all day long but are not able to keep warm and eat their fill. Caring for their elders and raising their children is even more difficult. The difficulty of making a living is unprecedented. It is hoped that they will follow the clear instructions of the authorities on wartime labor-management coordination, earnestly maintain existing employees, and, within the possible scope of business conditions, reduce dividends and official fees as much as possible, increase employee benefits, or provide group rice purchases or rice subsidies. Employees will naturally be inspired, work hard, and share the difficulties.</p>
<p>Four Car Companies Agree to Respond Tomorrow</p>
<p>The 900 drivers of the four car companies in this city, Yunfei, Xiang Sheng, Tailai, and Yinse, due to the ever-increasing cost of living, have made demands to these companies, including: (1) Increase annual bonuses; (2) Increase wages by 50% or increase 30 cents per day; (3) Increase subsidies by 100%. However, because the company authorities did not accept it, it was deadlocked. Later, with the mediation of Gu Bingyuan of the Industry Section of the Public Works Department, the employer agreed to respond at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The employees then sent representatives to the Public Works Department to negotiate with the employer's representatives again. However, the response was too far from the demands, and the employer even proposed to sign an agreement that the salary could not be changed within two years, which was even more dissatisfied with the employees, resulting in the breakdown of negotiations without any results.</p>
<p>The Final Key Depends on Tomorrow</p>
<p>Although labor-management negotiations have broken down, the employer agreed to make a final response at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. The employees will send representatives to the Public Works Department to hear the results. The employees' attitude is now very firm and they have decided to convene a general meeting at 9:00 AM this morning and establish a "Strike Committee". If the employer's response tomorrow can satisfy the workers, then such an unfortunate event can be avoided. People from all walks of life, given that these four companies are related to the city's transportation, hope that they will make concessions to each other and resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Salary Increase for Postal Workers Still Awaiting Reply</p>
<p>All postal workers and porters of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its subordinate branches, due to the pressure of making a living, made a request to the Director of the Postal Administration, Mr. Zha Peilin, in November last year through the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, to issue year-end bonuses, including various living allowances, and to issue living index subsidies, which are calculated as 21 yuan based on the multiple of the Public Works Department's living index. Zha has repeatedly asked the Kunming General Administration, but has not received a formal response. Now, the association, in view of the members' increasingly difficult lives, cannot wait any longer and has once again appealed to Zha, asking the Director of the General Administration, Mr. Guo, to reply satisfactorily before the 13th of the month. A reporter from New Voice News Agency inquired from all sides of the bureau yesterday, but there was no information about the arrival of the telegram. However, there were rumors, one saying that the telegram had been received yesterday afternoon, and another saying that it had not yet been received. Although sources revealed that the Kunming General Administration's reply was not received yesterday, it is expected that the telegram may already be on its way.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press Union Makes a Final Appeal</p>
<p>All employees of the Commercial Press Bookstore on 211 Henan Road and the Jing'an Temple and Avenue Joffre branches, after not being granted a salary increase by the employer, were very angry. However, in order to take care of the past cooperative spirit between labor and management and continue to serve the cultural world, they still strictly maintained order and did not take any excessive actions. In order to discuss proper solutions, the Union held a temporary emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday morning. After a long period of consultation, it was decided to telegraph General Manager Wang Yunwu in Hong Kong again, asking him to withdraw his order and accept the conditions proposed by the union in order to maintain their livelihood and work with peace of mind. The union also convened a group leader meeting at 5:00 PM last night. The opinions of all groups were consistent, and the union was fully authorized to handle the matter. In addition, the 800 workers of the Jing'an Temple Road edition printing plant, the Jiujiang Road typewriter copper mold factory, the Fujian Road manufacturing factory, and the Guangdong Road distribution warehouse affiliated to the Commercial Press also proposed five demands to the employer through the mutual aid association due to the difficulty of making a living.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury Also Experiences a Slowdown</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, "This newspaper (the 11th) is not complete." (Note: The newspaper was half as long as usual yesterday.) "This is due to a labor dispute. Some of the newspaper's printing workers have gone on strike. This matter is expected to be resolved peacefully. When it is published next week, it should be normal and complete."</p>
<p>Other Labor Disputes are Expected to be Resolved</p>
<p>Dock Workers Have Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>After the dock workers of the Suzhou River bank warehouses and stacks went on strike to demand a salary increase, it was heard that the contractors Xia Jinshan, Li Zhonggang, Qiao Bingwen, etc. have sent a plenipotentiary representative to consult with the workers' general representative Yang Jiasheng and others on a reconciliation method. After several decisions and negotiations, the labor and management have also agreed on the various conditions. The docks resumed work in full yesterday morning, and the reconciliation record will be signed this morning.</p>
<p>Guangji Hospital Holds Sincere Negotiations</p>
<p>All 150 employees of the Guangji Hospital on Route Pére Robert in the French Concession were expelled from the hospital on December 30th last year after they made a request to the hospital to improve their benefits without success, resulting in a strike. More than 400 patients in the hospital were left unattended for a while, forming a serious situation. This labor dispute has been deadlocked for ten days. According to a visit from the reporter of Ping Ming News Agency yesterday, the hospital and the employee side, after mediation by the French Police Political Department, the Catholic authorities, and Bishop Hui Jiliang, etc., have seen a glimmer of hope. The hospital has also accepted the advice and has decided to summon labor representatives and others for sincere negotiations in the coming days. The dispute can be resolved immediately. As for the dozens of new workers recruited by the hospital during the strike period, it is heard that they will resign successively after the labor dispute is resolved. The hospital does not intend to continue to recruit new workers.</p>
<p>All Knitting Disputes Resolved</p>
<p>The 300 engineers and technicians of 129 electrical knitting sock factories in the city proposed to the employers to improve their benefits and increase living allowances. After more than half a month of earnest negotiations between labor and management, they have been negotiated in order and most of them have resumed work since the other day. However, there were still eight or nine knitting factories that did not promise at the time due to their thin capital. Later, after separate scheduling by the authorities, they were completely negotiated the night before and slightly revised according to the proposed conditions. Yesterday noon, the representatives of labor and management separately signed the papers and each held one. The engineers and technicians of each factory also received a notice from the union yesterday morning to return to the factory and resume work in full.</p>

<h3>American Public Opinion Unanimously Sympathetic to China, Already Acknowledges China as an Ally, Changes Mentality of Passive Assistance</h3>
<p>Mr. Ross, international editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, departed from San Francisco last October for his second tour of the Far East, staying briefly in Japan before traveling through the Philippines, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. He recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. It is said that his purpose is to "observe the actual situation in the Far East" in order to write articles for the San Francisco Chronicle. A reporter interviewed Mr. Ross at his residence yesterday and learned that he will soon travel to Japan again before returning to the United States. The reporter inquired about American public opinion's reaction to the Far East. According to him, Japan's participation in the Axis Pact was a turning point for American public opinion. In the past, the United States was not as concerned about the situation in the Far East, but now the American people have begun to recognize the extreme seriousness of the Japan problem. Japan's open declaration of joining the Axis Pact is, in effect, a hostile act against the United States. Therefore, President Roosevelt's recent remarks criticizing Japanese policy represent the views of the general American public. Mr. Ross further stated that the American people now unanimously acknowledge China as one of their allies and have transformed their mentality from merely providing charitable relief to China. As for Britain, the United States is determined to avoid Britain's defeat by Germany at any cost. If necessary, the United States may declare war on Germany.</p>
<h3>British Tram Company Raises Fares, Municipal Council Has Approved, Lowest Fare of Six Cents to Be Implemented on Lunar New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>The British Shanghai Tram Company, after implementing a fare increase on June 17th of last year, recently used the continued decline in black market exchange rates as an excuse to petition the Municipal Council for approval to raise fares again. According to reporters from Pingming News Agency, the fare increase will be approximately 35%. The lowest fare, originally four cents, will increase to six cents after the price hike. As for monthly tickets, there will be no price increase this month. The current price of monthly tickets is 15 yuan for first class and 18 yuan for third class per month. Trams are a public utility, and the current prices of various commodities are already an unbearable burden for citizens. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can restrain the company, and it is hoped that the company can reorganize its business and increase revenue, instead of relying solely on increasing fares as the only way to increase revenue, which would make them a laughingstock to both Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>Original Submission from the Tram Company</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's Information Office, the Public Concession Tram Company recently claimed that the continued decline in exchange rates and the devaluation of the national currency have greatly affected various expenses. Therefore, it has petitioned the Municipal Council, based on the franchise charter, to allow an increase in fares of approximately 35% in order to supplement its income. According to the company's submission, in January 1930, the exchange rate was one shilling, five pence, and seven-sixteenths, but currently it has fallen to about three pence and seventy-five. In the same year, each unit of electricity cost only 3.05 cents, but in November of last year, it had risen to 16.27 cents. Coupled with the devaluation of the national currency, expenses have increased sharply. All payments made in foreign currency have increased due to the decline in foreign exchange rates. Based on these reasons, the company has no choice but to request an increase in fares to seek remedy. The case was discussed in a closed-door meeting of the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee. The result was that the request was deemed appropriate and should be approved. It was submitted to the council's regular meeting on the 8th of this month and passed, and will be implemented from the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>The "January 28th" Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Thrift Movement Committee, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Youth Federation, and other organizations, in order to actively express the commemorative significance of the 10th anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu War, specially resolved to launch the "January 28th" Donation Campaign, and jointly issued a letter to the compatriots of this city, which reads:</p>
<p>National Alarm Bell</p>
<p>"The anniversary of the January 28th Songhu War is approaching again. When we recall the pain inflicted upon us by a certain party ten years ago, we feel indescribable anger. Although this battle was not successful, it served as a national alarm bell. It awakened our compatriots from their drunken stupor, broke the traditional concept of selfishness and self-interest, and from that time on, every one of our compatriots began to understand that the nation had reached the final moment of life and death, forcing everyone to embark on a common struggle to save the nation from peril.</p>
<p>Donation Campaign</p>
<p>Now, as we are in the process of carrying out and striving to complete this great historical task, we should have an active expression to welcome this painful but glorious memorial day, especially our compatriots living in an isolated island, should make a great contribution to the struggling motherland. Therefore, we are launching the January 28th Donation Campaign, donating all the income of this day to the government, in order to enhance the strength of the war and complete the great cause of nation-building. This is an easy task, and we sincerely hope that compatriots from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically and donate generously."</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant's Tugboat Sinks in the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese merchant's tugboat "Wujiang No. 7" collided with a fully loaded cargo ship in the Suzhou Creek near Jiangxi Road Bridge at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 10th), causing it to sink. Salvage efforts began this morning (the 11th). The tugboat sustained a large hole from the collision, while the other ship suffered only minor damage. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident. Yesterday, passersby saw the sunken Japanese tugboat, which was quite a sight. About three-quarters of the ship was submerged in the dirty water of the Suzhou Creek, while the Japanese flag on the ship could still be seen above the water. Salvage workers inspected the site this morning, and it is expected that the sunken tugboat will be recovered in the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Leaves Post to Urinate, Captain Checks Post and Confrontation Ensues, Captain Insists Chinese Constable Intended to Assault Him, Trial Held Yesterday, Constable Sentenced to Detention, Special Alert at Jing'an Temple Police Station the Night Before Last, Strict Security at Court Yesterday, No Audience Allowed</h3>
<p>The night before last, there was a sudden and serious alert at the Jing'an Temple Police Station in the Public Concession. At the time, a large number of armed detectives and Chinese and Western police officers from the reserve team, as well as red guards, were dispatched, patrolling back and forth around the police station, making the situation very serious. According to reporters, this alert was caused by a conflict between a Chinese constable and a Western deputy captain.</p>
<p>Leaving Post to Urinate</p>
<p>The Chinese constable Bai Guifang from Xuzhou, stationed at the Jing'an Temple Police Station, was assigned to patrol at the end of Xinzha Road at 8:40 AM the day before yesterday, along with Chinese constables Nos. 2480 and 2527, and Indian constable No. 158 as their leader. At that time, the Western deputy captain, Russian Kekang Siji, passed by on a motorcycle patrol and saw that Constable Bai was not at his post. He asked the Indian constable, who replied that he had left to urinate. After a while, Constable Bai arrived. The Western captain said that he should not have left his post without permission and for ten minutes, and that he would report it for punishment. Constable Bai said that he had obtained permission from the Indian constable to go to urinate, and it was only two or three minutes, so he should not deliberately lie. A conflict arose during the conversation.</p>
<p>Gun Discharges</p>
<p>It escalated to pushing each other. The Western captain accused him of trying to pull out his gun and ordered the Indian constable to take the gun from Constable Bai. During the struggle for the gun, it suddenly went off, making a loud bang. The bullet was fired, fortunately pointing downwards, and no one was injured. As a result, the gun was taken away, and Constable Bai was taken to the police station. At that time, other Chinese constables who heard about it expressed their dissatisfaction and gathered without dispersing. The police station feared an accident, so they increased security. Yesterday morning, Constable Bai was escorted by the police station to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, and prosecuted under Article 305 of the Criminal Code for obstructing freedom with violence. Hundreds of Chinese constables, indignant, also went to the court to listen, so the entrance of the First Special Court was also heavily guarded.</p>
<p>Strict Security</p>
<p>The situation in the courtroom was even more serious. The chief of the police station, Gaxu, the Chinese head constable, Liu Ya'ying, and the Western judicial police chief, Huai Tuo, personally supervised the Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order in the court. The case was the last one, and it was not until around 11:00 AM that Judge Meng Tingke interrogated him. However, because all the Chinese constables were gathered in the court to listen, the situation was tense, and it was inconvenient for the trial, so Judge Meng declared that listening was prohibited, and all irrelevant people were asked to leave. The Chinese constables initially sat still and did not move, but after being persuaded with reason, they left the courtroom, but still gathered outside the court, waiting for a fair trial.</p>
<p>Disobeying Orders</p>
<p>The defendant, Chinese Constable Bai Guifang, No. 2725, hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as his defense attorneys. First, Judge Meng asked about his age and origin. Then, the police station's lawyers Peng Qixin and Jiang Baolian stated the case, accusing the defendant of disobeying his superior's orders and beating the Western deputy captain Kekang Siji with a police baton, violating Article 305 of the Criminal Code. According to the translation of the statement submitted by the Western deputy captain Kekang Siji, "Yesterday morning at 8:40, I was patrolling to the post on Xinzha Road and saw that the defendant was not there. I asked Indian constable No. 158, who said that the defendant left to urinate at 8:05. Five minutes later, the defendant came out of a teahouse. I immediately went to meet him, intending to record the facts. Unexpectedly, the defendant raised his hand to touch his gun and uttered dirty words, saying he would kill me."</p>
<p>Gun Discharges</p>
<p>"At that time, two other Chinese constables and one Indian constable stepped forward to take the gun. Suddenly, it went off. Later, one of them took the gun and handed it to me, but the defendant still wanted to take it back and took out a police baton, pulled on my cuff, and beat my arm, scolding me as a 'Russian bastard.' So, I twisted him into the police station to report," etc. The defendant confessed, "Because I wanted to urinate, I informed the Indian constable and temporarily left my post, and returned in only two or three minutes. At that time, the Western deputy captain asked me where I had gone. I replied that I had urinated. He immediately accused me of slacking off for ten minutes and insisted on reporting it for punishment. I expressed my dissatisfaction because I had informed the Indian constable about leaving my post to urinate, and it was only two or three minutes. Now, the captain insisted on reporting ten minutes, which was against his conscience. So, I said to him, 'If you tell a lie, you might be killed by a gun.'"</p>
<p>Did Not Draw Gun</p>
<p>"In other words, I patted the gun with my hand, but did not take it out. The Western captain misunderstood and, together with the Chinese and Indian constables, stepped forward and took my gun, causing the gun to go off. I have no enmity with the Western captain, why would I kill him with a gun for such a trivial matter? I did not insult him or beat him with a police baton," etc. According to the testimony of Chinese constables Nos. 2480 and 2527, the defendant did not draw his gun, nor did he beat the Western captain. However, the Indian constable No. 158 stated that the defendant did draw his gun to load bullets and used a police baton to beat him. After the debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Meng announced the verdict in court: Bai Guifang was sentenced to 30 days of detention. If he can pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at one yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

<h3>Xiecheng Rice Shop in Zhabei Illegally Obtains Border Pass, Purchases Thirty Bags of Saigon Rice Above the Price Limit, Apprentice Who Was to Transport Rice to Zhabei for Permit Arrested</h3>
<p>Authorities in the Concessions, in view of the soaring prices of rice in the city, traced the cause and found that most of it was caused by rice merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, which directly affected the livelihood of civilians and indirectly contributed to unrest. In order to suppress rice prices, in addition to assessing and setting price limits, restrictions such as requiring permits for transporting rice out of the Concessions were implemented. Recently, many rice merchants have been arrested and sentenced to severe punishments by the First Special Court for trading above the price limit. As a result, rice prices have been slightly stabilized in recent days. However, the police authorities have not relaxed their efforts. In addition to ordering a large number of detectives to secretly investigate rice storage in warehouses to find out the big hoarders, they are also strictly investigating those who sell above the price limit. Huang Heting, the owner of Xiecheng Rice Shop at No. 50 Datong Road, Zhabei, recently purchased 30 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice from Shengxing Rice Shop at No. 467 Jiangxi Road, at a price of 83 yuan per picul, exceeding the price limit by 1.5 yuan per picul.</p>
<p>Xiecheng's Purchase</p>
<p>This rice was originally intended to be transported to Zhabei, but according to the regulations of the Municipal Council, those who transport rice out of the Concessions must attach an invoice, fill out an application form, and apply to the Political Department of the Municipal Council for a border pass. However, Shengxing was unwilling to issue an invoice for this sale, which exceeded the price limit. Huang Heting had an idea and borrowed a blank invoice from Xinyuan Grain Store at No. 4 Lane 4 of Alabassett Road, filled it out himself, stating 50 bags of Saigon rice, valued at 4,500 yuan, and later changed it to 30 bags, indicating that the price was 83 yuan per picul. On the application form, he stated that the goods were</p>
<p>Stored at Xinyuan</p>
<p>And he planned to send apprentice Zhu Huibin to the Political Department to apply for a border pass. Unexpectedly, the head Chinese detective Mao Guobao and detective Li Bijun of the department discovered the above, and further found that the rice was not stored at Xinyuan, but at the Roosevelt warehouse. This incident not only involved selling above the price limit, but also suspected of illegally obtaining a border pass. Therefore, Li Huibin was detained and sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, requested that he be detained for further investigation of the principal offender.</p>
<p>Investigation and Arrest</p>
<p>After Judge Pei's interrogation, he ordered that Zhu Huibin be detained for one week for further questioning. It is reported that the police station is investigating all relevant principal offenders in this case and intends to prosecute them. In the near future, a large number of hoarders and rice profiteers may face the severe sanctions of the two regulations, "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Manipulation and Speculation in Extraordinary Times" and "Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce." With the utmost efforts of the Municipal Council, it is expected that the rice market in this city can be suppressed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>To Suppress Prices</p>
<p>If the rice profiteers are still unrepentant, only know how to line their own pockets, disregard the suffering of the people, and continue to act recklessly without repentance, then the suffering of imprisonment will come immediately. By then, their reputation will be ruined, and even if they want to repent, it will be too late.</p>
<h3>Royal Daughters' Society Raises 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Royal Daughters' Society of America in this city held a fundraising campaign at the beginning of this year to mark its 50th anniversary, with a target of 50,000 yuan. Since its launch, it has been going on for ten days, and yesterday the society announced that it has received donations of 7,400 yuan and 5 British pounds, and 37 people are willing to donate a considerable amount each month to cover the society's expenses. According to the society, it was established 50 years ago as a branch of the International Order Society, which is headquartered in New York, USA. Its initial scope was quite small, but after years of planning and operation, it gradually expanded and became a central relief organization for impoverished foreigners in this city. It established a hospital on Hongqiao Road with more than 40 patients, and also held charity events to provide clothing, medicine, and accommodation. Its members visit patients in more than 70 hospitals in this city every week. Recently, due to the depletion of funds, various tasks are on the verge of being suspended. Fortunately, the Municipal Council has agreed to subsidize the society's office expenses and subsidize patients with early-stage lung disease in the hospital. However, this is only a drop in the bucket and is not enough to solve the problem. Last year, monthly expenses reached 4,500 yuan, so a fundraising campaign was specially held. The society's authorities believe that fundraising is not an easy task, but because the number of people in need of relief is increasing day by day, this is the only way to save the general population from their suffering. Therefore, they have to make an urgent appeal to all sectors, hoping that people from all walks of life will donate generously. The branch's address is at No. 868 Fuxu Road.</p>
<h3>Ye Deben Rescued Last Night</h3>
<p>Ye Deben, styled Daozhang, a Ningbo native and manager of the Gung Dachang Silk and Cloth Store on Avenue Haig in West Shanghai, aged 50, was kidnapped at 6:50 PM on the 9th of this month. As he was working in the store, four bandits suddenly broke in and kidnapped Ye, putting him in a 12276 Yunfei taxi parked at the entrance of Xiaoyou Lane on Avenue Haig, and drove away quickly. Afterwards, the store reported the case to the French police, who are still investigating. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after being kidnapped, Pan was taken to the bandit's den at No. 8 Hexing Lane in the Hu's residence south of Hongqiao Road, where he was guarded by several bandits. Until about 3:00 PM yesterday, Pan suddenly saw a large number of "police officers" rushing into the bandit's den. The bandits still tried to resist, and as a result, four bandits were arrested, and Pan was rescued. He was taken to the "Xujiahui Police Station." It was only then that he learned that the "station's" patrol officer Huang Decheng and patrol leader Dang Xiucheng had learned of the bandits' whereabouts and led the crowd to rescue Pan. A pistol and a box gun were seized on the spot. The arrested bandits, including Liu Yun and others, were still being held.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Palais de Danse Gambling Den Case: Offenders Sentenced, Fines Imposed in Addition to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the Public Concession found that someone had established a Palais de Danse gambling den at No. 128 Lane, Avenue Haig, Jing'an Temple Road, and was gathering people to gamble. They secretly raided it on the 1st of this month and arrested 34 men and women, including staff members Li Zhen, Yang Jisheng, and Zhou Mingyao, as well as 60 gamblers. They were all taken to the First Special Court along with the gambling equipment and gambling money. After interrogation, the 60 gamblers were fined separately, and the remaining 34 male and female staff members were held for sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng ascended the bench at the Eighth Criminal Division and announced the verdict: Zhou Mingyao was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined 2,000 yuan. Fang Youwei, Hu Meimei, and others were each sentenced to 4 months in prison and fined 400 yuan. Wang Baoshan was sentenced to 6 months in prison and fined 1,000 yuan. Liang Bingzhi and others were each sentenced to 3 months in prison and fined 200 yuan. Chen Asan, Wang Zhishi, and others were each sentenced to 2 months in prison. Chen Qiaozhen and Chen Afeng were found not guilty. All the above defendants, except for Zhou Mingyao, were allowed to pay a fine of 3 yuan per day in lieu of imprisonment. The gambling equipment, etc., will be confiscated according to the list.</p>
<h3>Pan Zhiquan and Others Kidnapped: Four Bandits Drive Away the Chauffeur and Abduct Pan, Original Car Later Found on Route des Pères</h3>
<p>Pan Zhiquan, 42 years old, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, and the son of Pan Chengbo, the general manager of Jardine Matheson at No. 27 Beijing Road on the Bund, has a villa at No. 117 Route Loullie in the French Concession. Every day, he goes to the firm to assist his father in handling everything. At around 9:45 yesterday morning, he was being driven to the firm as usual by chauffeur Zhang Yunde in car No. 1235. Unexpectedly, when passing the intersection of Rue Ratard, four bandits suddenly emerged from the side of the road. Three of them were armed with firearms and stopped the car. Zhang, knowing that something was wrong, quickly accelerated, trying to escape forward. The bandits fired a shot as a warning. At that point, Zhang had to stop the car and wait for instructions. Then, the bandits crowded into the car, drove Zhang Yunde away, and one of the bandits took over as the driver, turning the car around and speeding away, disappearing. More than half an hour later, the car No. 1235 was found at the intersection of Route des Pères. After a street patrol saw it, he notified the police station and informed the Pan residence, who sent someone to claim and drive it back. Pan's whereabouts were still unknown by nightfall. Later, reporters went to his residence to investigate, but they firmly denied the incident and refused to tell the truth.</p>
<h3>One Person Shot and Killed on Avenue Hode</h3>
<p>Killed on the Spot by Three Gunshots for Refusing Police Search</p>
<p>At 8:50 PM last night, two men were wandering at the entrance of Lane 545, Avenue Hode, Rue Vouillemont in West Shanghai, with suspicious intentions. A Chinese constable spotted them and went forward to search them. The two men resisted. The Chinese constable fired three shots, hitting one of the men in the head, throat, and chest.

<h3>Food Supplies Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive, Broken Rice Prices See a Decline, but Trading Slightly Increases and Rice Prices Immediately Rebound, Sufficiently Demonstrating that Hoarders' Ambitions Have Not Yet Died</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a flat and tired trend. Generally, those hoarding goods saw that the futures were strong. Original packages from various foreign firms were dumped in large quantities, and the market continued to fluctuate slightly. Moreover, the source of supply was constant, with arrivals daily. Knowing that the market had no short-term hope, they successively pushed out their stocks, and the market was crowded with goods. The morning market was therefore soft, but the afternoon sales market suddenly became active because it was a weekly holiday today and local shops had increased their preparations. The shouting price immediately rebounded. As a result, the prices of all goods, except for rice tea and broken pointed rice, continued to fall slightly by one or two yuan. The rest did not fluctuate much. Number One Saigon still stood at the original price of eighty-seven yuan, eighty-six yuan eight jiao; Number Two, eighty-one yuan and a half, decisively to seventy-nine yuan.

New traders kept their hands off, while foreign firms kept canvassing. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson canvassed two thousand tons of Saigon broken rice for February, at a price of only sixty-nine yuan three jiao, but there were not enough buyers, and only one thousand five or six hundred tons were traded. The stock of broken rice in the market has been abundant for a long time, and new arrivals have been constant recently, and there have been entire batches transferred from Hong Kong. The sales route has been squeezed by cheap sales, and the market has suddenly seen an oversupply. Under the devaluation of floating households seeking profit, it has fallen again by three or four yuan. Extra-high rice tea is only quoted at around seventy yuan, mixed broken rice is only sixty-five or six yuan, and medium and lower grades have dropped from sixty yuan to fifty-five or six yuan, and the demand is not strong. There is still a tendency to decline in the future market. According to reports, broken rice is entirely the staple food of the poor, and its repeated sharp drop is indeed a good sign.

Kunshan Hu's japonica rice is still one hundred and two yuan, one hundred yuan; Qingjiao Hu's thin rice is ninety-nine yuan, ninety-eight yuan and a half; Original package one hundred and two yuan and a half, one hundred and two yuan.</p>
<p>The import and export of glutinous rice are both rare, and it is particularly quiet. Therefore, although the situation is tired, the market lacks change. Yili Baiyuan is still sold for ninety-two yuan to ninety yuan; Hong Kong Baiyuan is high from eighty yuan four jiao, decisively to seventy-seven yuan; Glutinous green special seventy-one yuan, Zhongguan goods sixty-eight or nine yuan, second to sixty-five or six yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Continues to Waver - New Arrivals of Foreign Flour from Hong Kong Go on Sale -</h3>

However, more than twenty thousand bags of the newly arrived Five Swallow brand and Blue Wheat Flower brand foreign flour from Hong Kong have been sold yesterday.

<h3>Economic Essays</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Kerosene (2) (Continued from July 7)</p>
<p>Before electric lights were popular, kerosene lamps were the only best tool for lighting. There are table lamps and wall lamps, with white porcelain shades and brass decorations, and the patterns are also exquisitely carved, so they are quite beautiful. Because kerosene is necessary for daily use, and its supply is in the hands of foreign merchants, kerosene was once the target of hoarding and speculation in the late Guangxu years. At that time, the kerosene market was also one of the market prices in various newspapers. Therefore, there were many people who lost their family fortunes.</p>
<p>The name and use of kerosene were seen in ancient China. The Biography of the Ancient City States in the New History of the Five Dynasties says:</p>
<p>"In the fifth year of Zhou Xiande, the King of Champa, Yinde Man, sent an envoy, Pu Hesan, to offer eighty-four bottles of fierce fire oil and fifteen bottles of rose water, ...... Fierce fire oil is used to sprinkle on objects, and fire comes out when it gets water. Rose water comes from the Western Regions, and when it is sprinkled on clothes, the fragrance does not fade even if it is worn out."</p>
<p>The so-called fierce fire oil is today's kerosene, probably refined from rice! At this time, kerosene was already popular in China, so Zuo Menglu, written by Song Kangyu, says:</p>
<p>"Northwestern border cities and defense city warehouses all dig large ponds in the ground, more than ten feet in length and width, to store fierce fire oil. In less than a month, the pond soil is all red and yellow, and another pond is made and moved there. If it is not like this, the fire will burn from the roof pillars. It is said that the fierce fire oil comes from thousands of miles east of Goryeo. When the sun first comes out, because of the heat of the summer sun, the rocks are extremely hot and the liquid comes out. Other objects will catch fire when they encounter it, but only true chalcedony utensils can store it. West of the Zhongshan Fuzhi is a large pond, which the county people call Haizi. I still remember the county commander going there to inspect the naval battle and test the fierce fire oil. On the other bank of the pond was the Hu people's camp. The oil user dripped the oil from the fire flame, and the raging flames suddenly broke out, and the Hu camp was completely destroyed in an instant. The remaining power of the oil entered the water, and the algae were all gone, and the fish and turtles died when they encountered it."</p>
<p>This statement of the function of fierce fire oil is not different from today's kerosene. There are also mentions of Annam producing fierce fire oil in historical books. It is important to know that Annam and Champa are now considered to be one place. Other miscellaneous records say:</p>
<p>"Fierce fire oil tree resin, produced in the Buddha Da Ni Kingdom, is very similar to camphor, but it can corrode human muscles. When burned and placed in water, the light and flame are more intense. The barbarians use it to make fire weapons, and its edge is very sharp. The sails, masts, and towers cannot stop extending, so even fish and turtles will be smelted when they encounter it."</p>
<p>This is not oil, but a kind of resin that can produce a great fire, so it is compared to fierce fire oil.</p>
<p>But in ancient times, it was also known to be a mineral, so there was the saying of petroleum. For example, it is said:</p>
<p>"There is petroleum in the territory of Fuyan. The old saying is that Zhisui comes from Gaonu County, which is it. It grows in the sandy stone by the water, mixed with spring water, and comes out in a daze. The locals use pheasant feathers to scoop it up and put it in a can. It is very similar to pure lacquer, and it burns like hemp, but the smoke is very thick, and all the roofs and curtains that are stained are black."</p>
<p>This is said to be crude petroleum, and its origin is where petroleum is produced in Shaanxi and Gansu today.</p>
<p>Since kerosene is popular, the tinplate dustpan is a product of the times. The dustpans used in China in the old days were either woven from bamboo strips or made of wood. Each half of the kerosene tank, cut diagonally, can be used as two dustpans, which are more durable than bamboo and wood, and unexpectedly become daily household items. There are also two kerosene iron boxes combined into one box to store clothes. Recently, there are also special ones made of galvanized white iron. In the past, Chinese vegetable oil was packaged in baskets or in huge changes. In recent years, oil shops in Shanghai have also used kerosene cans to sell raw oil and soybean oil. Large ones are packaged in large iron barrels. Therefore, the oil market is also divided into three types, one is the price per hundred catties (or the price per catty), one is the number that can be bought per yuan, and the other is the number sold per can. The weight of a large can of oil is 28 catties on the Sima scale and about 32 on the market scale.</p>
<p>The tinplate box of kerosene is called "tin", which is translated from the word Tin. Tin is also used to refer to utensils made of tinplate, so biscuits, etc., are also called tin when they are packed in tinplate boxes and cans, such as a tin of biscuits, a tin of kerosene, and so on.</p>

<h3>Talking About Interest</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Dear little brothers and sisters! Today I want to talk to you about the issue of interest. What I am about to say may not be golden words, but if you are willing to accept it, you will definitely gain something.</p>
<p>"Read when you are studying, play when you are playing." These two Western sayings tell us that we must be focused in everything we do, whether it is studying or playing. After understanding these two sentences, we should further understand that games should pay attention to interest, while reading should absolutely not be dominated by interest. Isn't that right? Because we seek interest to play games, so games must pay attention to interest; but can we say that we seek interest to read? Since we do not seek interest to read, then is it not necessary to consider interest when reading? Not necessarily. Eight out of ten children often fail to achieve satisfactory results in mathematics, mostly because children are not interested in mathematics. Let interest help reading, but not let interest dominate reading. You have a common problem: when you get a book, regardless of whether it is meaningful or not, as long as the content is exciting or the illustrations are rich, you are interested in reading it. On the other hand, no matter how meaningful a book is, if it has no illustrations or the material is boring, you feel disappointed. Can such reading be said to be not dominated by interest? Create interest in meaningful books, and knowledge will increase day by day, and reading will have rapid progress. I hope that all children can follow this path and continue to work hard!</p>
<h3>How to Ask Parents for Money</h3>
<p>— Zuo Hui</p>
<p>Asking parents for money often leads to rejection. Children, do you think that parents are always so unreasonable? I think you should know some of the ways to ask parents for money!</p>
<p>I often see many children gathered next to vendors at the school gate, buying some dirty mushrooms and squid to chew on. You should know that these snacks are harmful to your health. Then, for the sake of loving you, would your parents be willing to give you money casually? Therefore, the first thing to do when asking parents for money is not to buy snacks. You also have to explain the reasons well when asking for money. When parents see that you are making sense, how can they refuse! However, the reasons cannot be fabricated, because if you deceive your parents once, and they find out a second time, they will never give you money again!</p>
<p>Some families are relatively poor, so children should understand the suffering of their parents and be considerate of them. Don't be like other rich children. You should work harder in your studies. In this way, your parents will deeply love you, and when you occasionally need money, your parents will not refuse.</p>
<p>Also, when your parents are angry, children must not reach out. Otherwise, not only will you not get money, but you may even be scolded severely. At that time, even if you want money for a legitimate purpose, you will not be able to say anything.</p>
<h3>Confucius Practicing Prayers as a Child (Illustrated by Minhua)</h3>
<h3>The Selfish Giant</h3>
<p>— Qichen</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a selfish giant who had a beautiful garden. Inside were beautiful flowers, green grass, tall trees, singing birds, and honey-collecting bees. Every afternoon after school, countless children would come to play.</p>
<p>Unfortunately! One day, this selfish giant came back. He saw these many children playing in his garden. So he drove them out and built a big wall around it. He even erected a sign at the gate that read: "Trespassers will be prosecuted!"</p>
<p>Spring came! Everywhere was blooming with flowers and was very beautiful, but only this garden was still winter. The flowers and plants did not grow, and the birds did not sing. The snow covered the garden, and the branches seemed to have been sprayed with silver, all covered in frost, and the wind howled fiercely.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't spring come to my garden?" The selfish giant often looked at his garden and sighed, "I wish the weather would change for a while!"</p>
<p>But not only did spring not come, neither did autumn or summer. It was always winter: wind, frost, and snow.</p>
<p>One morning, he had just woken up in bed when he suddenly heard a very beautiful music in his garden. "Oh! I know that spring will come after all!" He jumped up happily and went to the window to look.</p>
<p>He saw a small hole in the high wall, and many children were climbing in one by one. A child was sitting on each tree in the garden. The trees were full of flowers, the ground was covered with grass, many birds were flying and singing in the trees, and swarms of bees were busy collecting honey—spring had really arrived!</p>
<p>Only then did he realize why spring had never come before. "I will tear down this high wall! And open the front door of the garden!" He shouted and ran into the garden. Many children saw the giant coming and all ran away. The entire garden became winter again.</p>
<p>After he tore down the high wall and opened the front door, many children came in again. The garden suddenly turned into spring again.</p>
<p>"This garden belongs to you forever! Children!" The selfish giant shouted and began to play with the children. The garden became as beautiful as before.</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Shuttlecock Kicking Competition</h3>
<p>— Mengbai</p>
<p>Cun De Elementary and Middle School on Guba Road can be considered a well-run private school in Shanghai. Principal Xu Wenxiang has spared no effort in promoting school affairs. Therefore, in recent years, the number of young people seeking education there has been increasing. Recently, in order to promote the sport of kicking shuttlecock, the school held another school-wide shuttlecock kicking competition the day before yesterday, which was very interesting. The author made a special trip to visit, so here, I will write some of my impressions below.</p>
<p>On that morning, the shuttlecock kicking competition started at 8:30 AM. Each grade selected five male and five female representatives. The school's physical education teacher served as the judge, and each person kicked twice. These students, after two months of practice in kicking shuttlecock, were already very skilled. They could skillfully play the shuttlecock on their hands or feet, using various techniques such as "pan," "guai," and "reverse kick." However, for the sake of simplicity, the competition only compared the "jumping kick." Among the various ways of kicking shuttlecock, the "jumping kick" is the most difficult, but as a result, a certain student from junior high school was able to kick dozens of times in a row. Therefore, the male and female championships were both won by students from the first year of junior high school. Probably the smaller the person, the more lively they kick, so the students from the larger second and third year of junior high school were not able to kick better than the students from the first year!</p>
<p>According to the school authorities, the reason for promoting kicking shuttlecock is because they see that in winter, kicking shuttlecock is one of the best sports. When kicking, the whole body exercises, which is undoubtedly very beneficial to health. Moreover, even on very cold days, a few kicks of the shuttlecock will warm the whole body. Especially in their school, where the playground is not very large, students easily break glass or kick people when playing ball games. As for kicking shuttlecock, there will be no such things happening. Even if the shuttlecock sometimes falls on someone's head, it is not very painful. After hearing this, I felt that kicking shuttlecock is indeed a sport suitable for winter and worth promoting. I hope that all children will not ignore this beneficial sport.</p>
<h3>Many Money</h3>
<p>— Cuba</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had three very lazy sons. One day, the farmer was dying and without hesitation called his three sons to his side and told them that there was a lot of money hidden in the field. He said: "You go to cultivate the field, and you will be able to find them in the soil." After hearing these words, the three sons excitedly asked their father where the money was hidden. They wanted to become millionaires without putting in any effort, but their father only replied: "Go cultivate the field."</p>
<p>After the father died, the three sons buried him and then hurried to the field to work hard digging the soil. The neighboring farmers were all surprised by the actions of these three children. They wondered why they, who had not tilled an inch of soil before, were now working so hard. They picked up every stone in the soil and threw it away. They dug for a long time, but there was no trace of any money. They thought that their labor was wasted.</p>
<p>When the following year came, their harvest in the field exceeded past records, and it was more abundant than any other farmland. At this time, they understood what their father meant. They realized that only through diligent work could they obtain money, and lazy children could never become millionaires.</p>
<p>From then on, they were no longer lazy. They worked hard in every season, and every year their harvest was better than that of the national villages, and they themselves became very strong men.</p>
<h3>Fourth Place in Elementary School Students' Summer Homework Competition: My Father</h3>
<p>— Xiangyao Elementary School, Bu Mufang</p>
<p>My family is a semi-farming, semi-studying family. My father likes to read and also knows how to farm. He has a very gentle personality and always has a smile on his face.</p>
<p>His favorite things in life are planting trees and fruits, and raising poultry.</p>
<p>The peach, apricot, and other trees growing on the ground around our house were all planted by my father. Every spring when the flowers bloom, they surround the house in the center. The chickens and ducks under the trees roam leisurely. My father is very happy to see this.</p>
<p>He likes to do things himself, such as catching tree worms, sawing branches, and feeding the poultry. He never asks others to do it for him. If there are minor disputes in the village, he is also asked to mediate. So he is very busy all day long. When people ask him to rest, he always says, "I like to do it and don't feel tired."</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, our hometown was in chaos. My father had no choice but to leave his beloved home and move to Shanghai. However, the living environment in Shanghai did not suit my father's personality. Moreover, he was a very active person. After arriving in Shanghai, he was idle all day long and could only look at books to relieve his boredom.</p>
<p>We can tell from his rarely smiling face the suffering in his heart. His only hope is to be able to return home soon and put his efforts into rebuilding the fields.</p>

<h3>Recommendation of "The Story of Reuters"</h3>
<p>— Liantai</p>
<p>This film is not only worth appreciating by us in the news industry, but it is also the best motto for everyone when doing things—because Reuters tells you that you should have a spirit of perseverance and a serious attitude that is not afraid of ridicule for any kind of work. Reuters was like this to his beloved wife, to his colleagues, and to the final climax in court, because he understood something with certainty.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the Reuters News Agency in England now has become an official news organization or whether this organization is being used as a tool in political struggles, Jolly Reuters did not have insidious ambitions, or want to show off, or want to make a fortune. This can be seen from Reuters' repeated conversations with the banker Randolph. He once said to his beloved wife, "For the sake of the public," he wanted to announce the news of Lincoln's assassination. At the same time, in court, he said, "A free people should have newspapers that can speak freely."</p>
<p>Reuters also repeatedly said that news reports must be accurate and fast, and believed that the news industry is a sacred work.</p>
<p>I hope that people in the news industry have this spirit, and I hope that everyone has an attitude that is not afraid of failure and not afraid of ridicule.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning the technique of director William Dieterle. He is the maverick director of Hollywood biographical films, with past works such as "The Story of Zola," "The Life of Emile Zola," "Juarez," and "All That Money Can Buy." As for the dubbing artist of this film, Stein, is also worthy of our praise, making the film have good sound effects.</p>
<h3>Reply:</h3>
<p>To Xie Bobo: The songbook is scheduled to be published once a week. This year, because of the publication of the long novel "Zhangtai Willow," the pages of this publication have become narrower and narrower. Therefore, "Spring Comes to the World" is printed in a small half-page, and it was found afterwards that it was not clear enough. In the future, we will enlarge the plate, but the date cannot be fixed. Sincerely.</p>
<h3>Yin Xiucen Joins Yi Hua</h3>
<p>— Xinggu</p>
<p>After Bai Hong officially left Guolian and joined Jin Xing, followed by Mei Xi and Sun Min also leaving the Guolian Company, now Yin Fatty (Xiucen) has also completed his contract with Guolian, and is preparing not to renew it and seek other developments.</p>
<p>It is said that Yin Fatty has been in the film circle for a full ten years. He is from Beiping. When Lianhua Company went to Ping to set up the Fifth Branch and recruited film talent training institutes, Fatty signed up and took the exam. After being fortunately admitted, he officially entered the screen.</p>
<p>His first film to appear on the screen was "New Grievances of the Forbidden City." Yin Xiucen played a funny villain with a weight of 285 pounds. After the completion of "New Grievances of the Forbidden City," he came to Shanghai and entered Lianhua First Factory. After the war, he joined Xinhua and filmed "Beggar's Daughter" and "Cold Moon Poetry Soul."</p>
<p>Yin Xiucen's performances in all previous films have been very satisfactory, and he is considered to be an actor who can act very well. However, his talent has always been buried by directors and cannot be fully utilized, so he wants to seek other developments.</p>
<p>Initially, it was Yi Hua Company who contacted him through Wang Long. If Yin Xiucen joined Yi Hua together with Han Langen, Hong Jingling, and Zhang Zhizhi, Yi Hua would be willing to pay a monthly salary of 1,500 yuan for the four of them, and the remuneration for each film would be given separately. However, in fact, Han Langen holds an important position in Guolian and will inevitably not be able to leave Xinhua to join Yi Hua. Therefore, Yi Hua is very interested in recruiting Yin Xiucen alone. At the same time, Yin Xiucen is also very willing to transfer to Yi Hua. Recently, negotiations are underway on the matter of monthly salary, and the opinions are very close. However, Yin's contract with Xinhua still has one week left, so the contract with Yi Hua must be signed one week later. Generally speaking, this matter will not change again.</p>
<h3>Film City News You Need to Know</h3>
<p>— Huilin</p>
<p>James Cagney gave an excellent performance in Warner Bros.' recent film "City for Conquest". According to Hollywood opinion, he really has a chance to win an Oscar. If he wins an award, it will be Cagney's first time in his life.

<p>The recent Aid Britain movement in Hollywood is very active, and it is sparing no effort to raise relief funds for the British war effort, and is not hesitating to help with spirit and material. "Tonight at 8:30" is a film adapted from a famous British play by playwright Coward. Actors and others are all volunteers. In addition, male stars such as Colman, Michael O'Shea, Ellen Mobley and Henry Fonda, as well as female stars such as Rita Hayworth and Simone Simon, are all enthusiastically donating or adding voluntary performances, all for the purpose of raising relief funds.</p>
<p>German actress Marlene Dietrich, who has become an American citizen, is going to divorce her husband, Rudolf Sieber, with whom she has been living for a long time. However, their young daughter does not want her parents to divorce, so this matter is still on hold, because Marlene does not want her daughter to be too sad.</p>
<p>It is said that Warner Bros.' "Little Six Giants" are going to split up, because the biggest of the six giants, named Barry Harrow, is leaving the other five. As for these five little giants, they also plan to join another company. Are they afraid that Warner's salary is too low?</p>

<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>That evening, Liu Rushi had many thoughts running through her mind. Unexpectedly, while she was hurrying to leave, Qian Muzhai returned the next day. How could Liu Rushi not be delighted? She then spoke secretly with Muzhai for a long time in the room, strongly urging Muzhai to respond to Huang Yuqi and jointly raise a righteous army. Because Jiangyin and Changshu were originally adjacent, she also wanted Muzhai to draft a proclamation. How cautious was Muzhai? As timid as a mouse, how could he rashly raise an army? He then said that he was a scholar, without military power, how could he suddenly raise a righteous army? If things went wrong, it would only lead to regret. Yuqi had previously started an uprising in Jiangyin and failed, killing many innocent people. This was a profound lesson. Therefore, he was unwilling to draft this proclamation. Liu Rushi was greatly disappointed again. After much persuasion, she finally agreed to donate family wealth to support military expenses. He would wait for Huang Yuqi to take Jiangyin, then observe the situation to determine his allegiance. This was also Qian Muzhai's cunning. Liu Rushi had no choice but to volunteer to go to sea to reward the troops and encourage morale, intending to take this opportunity to express her grievances to Huang Yuqi. Muzhai initially refused to let her go, thinking it was a dangerous matter. Liu Rushi said, "With Shi Da's help, I will certainly be safe. If you cannot immediately respond yourself, nor let me go, then I will die before you, unwilling to endure this infamous reputation any longer." Muzhai saw that Liu Rushi's attitude was very firm and had to allow Rushi to go secretly, but absolutely not to reveal it. After the couple had agreed, Liu Rushi accompanied Muzhai downstairs to see Shi Da. Shi Da reiterated his request for Muzhai to support the action, and Muzhai gave a vague response. Liu Rushi then told Shi Da that she was willing to go to sea to reward the troops, to meet Huang Yuqi, and provide some military supplies, asking for Shi Da's protection. Shi Da gladly said, "It is best if Madam Liu can go. I have a seagoing ship anchored outside Jiangyin, which can take Madam Liu along. At this moment, Lord Huang has probably left Zhoushan." (33)</p>
<h3>Words on Self-Cultivation (9)</h3>
<p>Of the things in the world that do not go as one wishes, eight or nine out of ten are common. If one is imprisoned by unpleasantness and harbors melancholy, then one will have little joy in life. If worry can harm a person, one's life cannot be sustained, how can there be ample spirit to engage in struggle! Therefore, having a broad mind and forgetting everything is a fundamental virtue of life.</p>
