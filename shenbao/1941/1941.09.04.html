<h3 id="c16">日本態度與美日談話 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>本月一日，日本陸軍報道班長馬淵逸雄發表演說，表示日本必須衝破ABCD之包圍，如有必要，，將援用武力；並謂如外交努力失敗，則將被迫運用武力、不顧戰爭將歷時如何長久，且縱戰至最後一人並夷土地爲灰燼亦所不惜。這一類劍拔弩張的硬話，本屬日本急進份子的老生常談，在平時並不十分値得驚異，但目前美日間正進行着極重要的外交接觸，近衛致美總統的函件內容雖未透露，至少也表示着其殷切的期待，而馬淵以軍部發言人的資格突於此際發表强硬論調，這可信絕不是淸澤冽之流所談的討價還價問題。另一方面，日政府情報局發言人偉岸一隔昨在對外籍記者談話時則逕謂馬淵的談話與日政府對美日談話所抱態度無關，並勸人勿就馬淵談話多做猜測，這大概是代表着日政府當局的態度。在日政府與軍部雙方發言人之間，見解何以有如此的紛歧，此中消息，外人苦難索解；所可斷言者，在馬淵這一表示之下，當更使美日關係的前途籠罩了一重新的暗影。</p>
<p>關於美日談話，主動地位固在美方掌握之中，其前途的有無結果，則完全要看日本如何去選擇，關於這一點，英相邱吉爾日前的演說已有明確的說明。羅斯福總統九月一日的演說、正與其近頃的若干文吿一樣，並未正面提及日本，這並不是有意規避，而是要使日方有充分的反省機會，其反對侵略的堅決立塲，並不單獨對於遠東有所保留。日當局切望打開美日僵局的意念，三四年來從未間斷過，但却迄未準備付出可爲美方接受的代價。近衛致美函件的發出大概是進行此一企圖的最高度表現，據連日美方消息：也並未提出具有建設性質的建議，這是可以從美方一般反響上面看得出的。準此而論，則目前尙停留在試探階段的美日談話，前途只有極微弱的希望，日政府態度即使較爲持重，也並不能使美日關係獲有實質上的進步，即或在日方某一階層當中已深切體會到美日僵局之必須打開，但却沒有一個人對於所以打開僵局之道公然有所昌言，其所見於輿論者，却什九都是和馬淵演說相類似的見解。</p>
<p>不過，即使美日談話的本身很難希冀有所成就，但在談話進行過程中，至少可使太平洋上的緊張空氣稍告緩和，並使屆近爆發的危機略事延展，美日雙方無疑都同樣具有這樣的要求。美當局之至今一貫重視納粹威脅，從羅斯福在勞工節的演說可以充分看出，因此也切望太平洋暫能相安，不過這一相安却一定要從日本擴展全圖的阻遏來達到，絕不是放任日本去任意利用其北達「滿」蒙南迄越南的「國防圈」。以援用武力相威脅的恫嚇，在以前容或可以造成柬京協定的締結與滇緬路的封鎖，在此際却不足以迫令民治國家有所讓步。馬淵的見解即使不能代表日政府政策，至少亦足使世人瞭解馬淵所代表着一部日人的見解。揆其用意，從對內一方面來講，殆不外激勵國民，以破釜沉舟的決心準備運用武力，但是另一方面，這在國際方面亦必發生深刻印象，更加重其對於未來局勢的戒懼和警惕。</p>
<p>由華盛頓方面最近態度的沉默，可以證明美日間的談話無所進展，在日方焦躁强硬表示的漸次透露之下，更難望雙方癥結獲得打開。談判的無結果固然並不一定就是危機的爆發，但此次之進行談判顯屬最後警告性質，日前邱吉爾演說中曾明言倘若美方期望成立公道和平解決的希望而竟告失敗，則英國自當毫不遲疑站在美國方面，邱吉爾並不曾明言英美將來那一合作所要採取的步驟，而從近頃各民治國家關於速東的種種動向推測，那絕不會是繼續放任遠東危機的擴大和蔓延。</p>

<p>合衆社三日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨與國會顧問討論世界大局、並與國務卿赫爾作一長時間之會談、國會代表兼衆議院發言人胡特拉姆稱、國會會議係「普通」性質、渠稱、羅斯福總統盛讚蘇聯軍隊之對德反抗、並討論一切立法問題、</p>
<p>台衆社二日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨吿報界謂、美·日談話並無新發展、集亦拒絕發表總統有吾答覆由日大使野村提呈之近衛手札、渠對報上登載之日本將在其屬島四週設立安全區一事、亦拒絕作任何批評、</p>
<p>路透社三日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨告新聞記者、關於美·日關係、未有新發展可告、從這今所繼續進行之談話、祇爲試探性質、至於東京所傳日本對於美國運油往海參崴事、已向美政府交涉一說渠未便有何批評、</p>
<p>路透社三日華盛頓電　此間一部份官塲人士、包括若干國務院人員在內、對於遠東事件似抱有不同之意見、聞有高級官員數人主張、日本保留滿洲及越南、而以完全退出中國本部、並復元其海軍爲條件、另有其他熟諳東亞情形之官員、則對於此項建議表示疑問、其理由爲欲使中國讓步巳不可能、而欲日本軍事當局同意退出中國更難辦到、並信如任日本保留滿洲及越南、則將便利日本日後之擴張、及危害中國之安全、叉有若干觀察家認爲、美國所處地位、將使其極難提議對日作領土之讓步、因對於其他軸心國、決不能作同樣之提議、蓋如此將不啻放棄反軸心主義中之若干最重大原則也、</p>
<p>會談如告失敗　日閣又將改組</p>
<p>國際社三日華盛頓電　自日本建議對太平洋各問題應獲諒解後、據悉羅斯福總統昨已在白宮中與國務卿赫爾舉行會議、討論美政府對日方建議之覆書措辭、赫爾與總統會談後、即與國務院中之遠東問題專家作長時間之會談、一般人預料、總統對近衛首相之私人函件、本週內即將答覆、但美·日裂痕是吾業已彌補、此間人士尙表懷疑、據悉、國務院現正努力、欲覓得一種根據、俾開始談判、以獲致一「停頓協定」阻遏太平洋中發生戰事、惟除非日·美有協定之望恐未必作實際上之談判、官方僉認、近衛首相不惜以其內閣之命運孤注一擲、期與美國獲得諒解、萬一失敗、則渠之內閣將由一强硬之軍人內閣起而代之、</p>
<p>海通社三日東京電　新東亞聯盟會　文近衛自相、請以同樣尖銳政策、對付美國之對日政策、其幕略謂、日本於參加三國公約之際、曾力當維持世界和平之決心、故願盡力設法終止中國戰爭、並建立大亞細亞共榮圈、而美國適於是時竭力破壞日本此種和平政策、並與英國及荷印合作、阻止日本向南方和平發展、日本對於英國此種舉動、實已不能容忍、美國近更加緊其對日本之經濟壓迫、一方面更援助與三國公約敵對之國家、有意使戰爭延長、同時更斷然擴展其領海範圍、公開援助英國、並派遣軍隊進駐冰島及格陵蘭、此種行爲、顯然違反中立、願日本政府繼續保持三國公的之精神、改組東亞、並切斷援助重慶政府之一切路綫云、</p>
<p>路透社三日蘇列克電　巴斯勒日報柏林訪節稱、德國對於日本目下對世界大局之態度、頗感焦慮、因外傳松岡洋右（軸心三國公的發起人之一）所以辭去外相職、以讓豐田者、欲予豐田以獲取日·美諒解之機會也、衆皆承認豐田恒主對美維持良好關係云、</p>
<p>英倫人士意見　對日決不讓步</p>
<p>倫教三日電　近衛致函羅斯福總統後、雙方在華府巳就遠東局勢舉行會談、惟此間所得消息甚少、在具體談話內容求公開前、英倫人十意見、可綜合如下、第一、英人無意讓步、日本發動此次談話、足證日本巳了解英美之決心及兩國「反綏靖政策之效力、此次談話、邱吉爾巳予美總統以全權、表示絕對信任、邱吉爾此項決定、各方咸表支持、一般認爲此項談話乃英·美輿論與日本軍人之爭、絕不致如以前之退讓失策、第二、一般相信、此决談話可予雙方以檢討全般意見紛歧之機會、但會談極爲困難、因其允諾常不兌現也、第三、一般以爲、此次談話、無論如何不能以暫時之安全即作讓步、而根據道義原則、英·美仟何一國之行動、均不能違反羅斯福、邱吉爾官言之精神、以及赫爾國務卿於一九三七年所宣布之原則、故於此必須劃定範圍、日本苟逾越界錢、英·美應不異以兵戎相見、第四、不能放縱經濟制裁、因此乃英·美在太平洋上戰略之基本原則、第五、根據事實上之證明、中國從蘇聯力能拖住侵略者、應予以完全信任、因此任何足以危害中國、蘇聯及荷印之讓步及調整、均屬不能想像、荷印係美國橡皮之主要來源地、故不能聽其落人侵略者之手、第六、日本巳知其加入軸心毫無所得、亦知茍太平洋發生戰事、德國絕無法相助、如日本要求滿意解決其條件與過去所擬議者、當完全異致、日本應以行動保證、而不能徒尙空言、第七、在下列情形之下、應經常監視日本、即（一）日本如進行其目前之外交政策、（二）日本仍依附軸心、（三）仍繼續進侵中國、（四）日本仍高　「東亞共榮圈」、因「東亞共榮圈」即其對南太平洋有領土擴展野心之表示也、</p>
<p>路透社三日重慶電　中央日報今晨社論稱、美日在華盛頓之討論、終必失敗、如日本在討論甲讓步、等於日本承認失敗、如日本堅持其開拓政策、則討論必致決裂、結果、太平洋之局勢將更嚴重、</p>

<p>歐戰叢談</p>
<h3 id="c43">開展時莫斯科情況 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>美國Collier's週報所　派的女記者　紫Aliceleone　Moats，係在德軍進攻蘇聯前兩星期，趕到莫斯科，目覩開戰時俄京情况，甚爲新頴，這是她第一篇無綫電報吿，茲譯錄於後：</p>
<p>德軍進攻蘇聯那天早晨，某外交官告訴他胡女僕說，已經打起仗來了。她聽到這消息，便帶著　拉夫種人聽天由命的神氣，回答道，「假使已經打起來，讓他打起來就是了，」說著，她圍上打掃時所穿胡裙子，照常工作去了。</p>
<p>這正好反映蘇聯全國人民對於戰爭的態度。莫斯科當時一種安謐的情形，眞是出乎尋常。驚惶紛　的跡象，可說一點也沒有。甚至德大使尙留莫斯科時，大使館門前也沒有什麼民衆示威游行。市民照常做事，除了每夜燈火管制，成羣結隊的後備兵紛紛奔赴招兵所，和各人都携帶防毒面具外，莫期科恰如平時無異。</p>
<p>六月廿二日晨九時，某國大使館友人電話將記者喚醒，囑勿照預定計劃，下鄕遠足，謂英國廣播電台方纔報吿，德軍巳在淸晨四時進攻蘇聯，德大使舒倫堡亦已於五時三十分赴克里姆林宮通知正式宣戰。記者下榻的旅館離克里姍林宮很近，轟炸時恐遭池魚之殃，遂收拾行裝，決定移居友人家。中午，各處屋頂所裝無綫電擴音機播送莫洛托夫的演說，告蘇聯人民說，他們巳和兩年前簽訂互不侵犯友好條的的國家交戰八小時了。</p>
<p>記者携箱篋入穿堂，見旅館前的出差汽車都很神秘的不見踪影了，許多人已排列成行，正在候車。記者遂亦預定客車一輛，但一小時後，還不見開到，祇得留下箱籠，往步前行。中途折入美大使館駐足，見職員多已依照預定計劃，疏散至四鄉辦公，大使住宅也巳遷往郊外廿六哩某地。各國大使館也多已有此準備，且已在一星期前，把婦孺和决要職員，送往鄉間。</p>
<p>據記者的經騐，這種情勢之下，常會發生混亂的，因料莫斯科市民或　也會爭先恐後，蠭湧逃難吧，孰知街道上的情景，竟如平時星　假日一般。信步前行，第覺一般情形，鎭定如常，所聽到的喧閙聲，祗是擴音機宣布莫斯科一區完全實行燈火管制，及各項防空規則而巳。行人往來，臉上非但沒有驚惶之象，且毫無何種表情。記者細心考察其中緣故，初疑其爲受驚所致，可是後來和某英人談起道事，據他說，俄羅助人常是這樣麻木不仁的。沿途也有些人，一起站着，談論消息，但多數人仍是爲着尋常的事情，往來奔走而已</p>
<p>不過有一事却是特殊現象，即開戰後數小時，他們已一變其從前不信任外國人的態度了。記者每向人含笑點頭，其人就止步　記者攀談起來。記者吿以不懂俄語，他們便常以能吾操德語爲問，記者連忙說明是美國人，然後答以能操德語。他們說起德國强暴背棄信義，雖多醜辭，但對戰爭的勝負，自信甚堅，沒有表示炸毫懷疑的。基輔等地雖已被絲，並巳聽釗平民死傷二百人的消息，但他們確信敵機決不能迫近京城實行轟炸。記者曾向所遇諸人，對於開戰消息，是吾完全出於意料。他們都答道，前兩星期雖有德蘇行將衝突的謠言，然而沒人相信眞有其事的。某婦人且謂戰事不致曠日持久。記者問其理由何在，她說，「因爲他不是蠢貨呀！」記者追問，「誰人不是蠢　？」她答道「希特勒」，說完，她便走了。她這話眞意何在，記者至今仍在五里霧中。</p>
<p>動員的後備兵，紛紛往兵站報到，一律携帶防毒面具，携帶水囊的也很多。平民見之，並不騷動，第一天，儲蓄銀行和雜貨店前，有人列隊鵠候，爭購食糖，番薯，麵粉，和通心粉等物。</p>
<p>翌日，當局宣布食糧充足，民衆遂照平時一樣購辦食物。嗣後所見列成長行的人民，只有列寗墓前，等候入內憑弔，還有售地圖的商店前和報攤前。郵局前，亦有許多人，各携無綫電收音機寄存，但各家仍備有擴音機，播送政府電臺的節目。</p>
<p>莫斯科晚報出版時，候購的人特別多，這種報紙載有各種廣吿，是其特色。那天晚上，記者曾注意購報的人，莫不一到手就翻閱末頁的廣吿。在這危急時期，他們仍好整以暇，注意日常問題，倒也難得。開戰時正是莫斯科各戲院生意冷淡的季節，却仍有戲院五所在表演歌劇和喜劇。還有方才開幕的馬戲團，繼續開演，觀衆每塲滿座。電影院營業也盛，現在所映各片，都是戰爭片，愛國片，往時俄國戰勝德國的歷史片，和反法西斯片。報紙上也巳提起卓別林所演的「獨裁大家」，譽爲最佳的影片，且有運來莫斯科開映之說。</p>
<p>菜館和夜總會也抱「照常營業」主義，京都旅館的大餐間每晚仕女如雲，雖巳實　燈火管制，但在改用的黯綠燈光下，仍能婆娑起舞，愉然飲宴。昨夜記者蒞著名的高加索餐室小坐，所見情景，和前决往游時，並無改變，那裏的高加索音樂和舞蹈還是和以前一樣的熱鬧興奮，記者旋即點了精美的菜餚和美酒，飽餐一頓。</p>
<p>二十二日晚，記者驅車夜游俄京戰時情况，見燈火管制嚴密有效，令人驚異。全巿在夏夜的灰白色微光之中，比較平時街燈通明時更美觀了，（莫期科在夏夜祗午夜十二時到晨間二時纔一片墨黑）。家家窓戶，沒有一絲燈光透出，警察手持罩蓋的紅綠燈，指揮交通，街頭頓現耶穌聖誕夕氣象</p>
<p>翌日，無綫電臺宜布，昨夜有七人違犯燈火管制規則被捕。市民都認德機飛來襲擊，大有可能，所以在開戰第一天一夜裹，都巳懸起厚厚的窓幃和一黑燈罩了。更有一天，特別愼一重，竟將窓戶完全釘上靑色窓帷，因之白天也不能開窓，從朝到夜，不見天日，大約衹得在黑暗中摸索過活了。</p>
<p>夜班巡邏隊，每三小時換班一决，察看各屋有無微光洩漏，十分認眞，記者友人在下午三時開燈，即被警告，鄕間有人蓄白狗一頭，巡邏隊也囑將狗毛染黑。窓戶上多已黏貼布條，以防玻璃震碎。家家並已在天井裏開掘防空壕。公寓和大厦的扶梯邊都置備滅火用的沙袋。各公寓房客必須輪流守夜，注意空襲警報，喚醒旁人。飛機晝夜不斷巡邏市空。二十三日，全市屋頂和廣塲巳滿架高射砲。醫院都巳實行遷往四鄉。惟火車和公共汽車仍照常行駛，據記奢確悉，火車往來，未會阻斷過一决。</p>
<p>廿六日，軍事當局宜布戒嚴，囑民衆在午夜十二時到晨間四時，無論乘車或徒步，切弗在街頭往來。戲院，餐窒和其他公共塲所，須在每夜十時三刻一律打烊，且不得出售「伏特加」酒。廿叫日淸晨三時，記者被警報聲驚醒，因得見到莫期科準備的嚴密。記者醒來，立即披衣到天井裏觀看究竟，街頭有少數人民忽忽奔過，但神氣並不十分驚惶。繼有飛機嗡嗡聲傳來，抬頭四顧，附近高射砲巳開火。記者急忙大步飛奔回屋，避入地室，見傭僕都巳集在那裹，其中俄維斯人和韃靼人極鎭靜，伏爾加河流域的日爾曼種人却惶然不寗。高射砲和機關槍繼續猛烈射擊，不過沒聽到炸彈落地爆炸，很以爲奇，一度雖似有一炸彈落在附近，却原來是鄰居穿睡衣奔出後，門忽閉上，嗣乃施用利斧破門，發生碰然聲</p>
<p>次日，報紙宣布這不過是實際防空演習，試騐空防的效力而已。</p>
<p>開戰第一天，蘇聯西部全境幾乎全部戒嚴，一切行政都由軍事當局接管。最高議會主席團且授權軍事當局，得以隨時微募平民從事防衛消防和防疫工作，守　運輸，交通和電廠。軍事當局且有權調整貿易，計　授糧，限制旅行和驅逐不良份子。</p>
<p>傘兵防衛隊已經編成，各村都設警備處，備步槍等兵器，凡見傘兵，必須到警備處報警，召集村民各取槍械，立即出戰。二十六日軍事當局令飭各機關各工廠，將每日工作八小時延長一小時至三小時，逾時工作，工資加半。假期也都取銷。凡巳動員的男子，家中留下一人者，月貼生活費一百羅布，留有二人者，月貼一百五十羅布，留有三人以上者，月貼二百羅布。</p>
<p>從軍男子所遺職務，多由婦女接替，婦女且有願入伍者，當局以蘇聯壯丁充足，因未核准。現在前綫後方工作者共有婦女五千萬人，其中從事農作者一千九百萬人，在工廠和各機關工作者、千一百萬人，餘者則加入救護隊，駕駛公共汽車，雷車，指揮交通或充防空員。</p>
<p>開戰最初幾天，蘇聯當局祇在早晨發表戰報一决，但從二十八日起，每天午後一時和十一時，招待新聞記者兩决，由外交副委長羅柴夫斯基擔任官方發言人，其地點在新設情報局，前由總司令部發表戰報，現巳改由情報局發表了。情報局址原爲某國公使館，記者初决出席記者招待會時，不覺想起以前曾在那裹參加很熱鬧的外交宴舞會，此時此地不免有異樣的感覺。</p>
<p>羅柴夫斯基留着灰白鬍髭甚長，濃眉下面，兩目炯炯，機敏幹練，一望而知。先操俄語發言，有懂俄語的新聞記者，便代爲譯成英語，轉吿同業。記者有問，羅柴夫斯基却操法語作答，（他也懂得少許英語，說在幾個月內定能操流利的英語）。羅氏作答，率直迅速，談笑風聲。</p>
<p>蘇聯報紙反應各方面情況很甚安寗。各報登載戰訊，異常坦白，旣不誇張勝利，也不隱諱敗績。眞理報可代表一般民意，據說凡我蘇聯人民，都應勝弗驕，敗弗餒，更不應抱易勝的謬見。一對反覆無常的强敵交戰，須作重大的犧牲和努力而後可」。各報又以俄國曾在十三世紀擊敗條頓族武士，並在一八一二年擊破拿破崙軍隊的事，鼓勵人民。</p>
<p>某將領曾撰文載消息報說，德軍無敵之說，荒誕不經。德國所以得逞，多因被侵略各國有第五縱隊策應所致。但蘇聯已有先見之明。三年多前早巳肅　此輩了。</p>
<p>報紙對於有聲有色的戰役經過，或士兵的英勇戰蹟，並不多載，反德宣傳大多斥責希特勒的反覆無常。街頭商店櫥窗外，都有民衆慶集，昂首觀看反德招貼諷刺畫。全市牆壁都貼有莫洛托夫宣戰檄文中摘錄的口號。高牆大垣上還張貼大幅漫畫，其一繪紅軍士兵舉槍直刺希特勒，希特勒的頭顱則穿過蘇德協定的破紙。另一幅繪有一大砲彈，將希特勒擊成碎片，彈上寫「粉碎法西斯野蠻主義　標語。（完）</p>

<p>自由談小談又開學了  伍岱　　學校又開學了。在這生活費用飛漲的現狀下，預料又有許多可歌可泣可哀可嘆的事情發生。　　有些靑年不能夠再入學讀書了。他們在靑黃不接的情形之下，不得不依依不捨地離開學校，到陌生的社會上去自力謀生。我們對這些靑年，表示無限的　情。　　有些家長為要使子女得以繼續學業，縮衣節食，含辛茹苦，甚至奔波吿貸。他們以子女的幸福為幸福，情願犧牲個人的享受以求子女敎育的完成。我們對這些家長表示深切的敬　。我們希望做子女的人，不辜負父母的苦心。　　有些學生雖然有繼續讀書的福氣，但是他們沒有意志的自由。因為這些自作聰明的家長，以自己的興趣為子女的興趣，把自己未滿足的野心寄托在子女身上。他們勉强子女去讀個性不相近的科目，他們抱着最好的心意，去做大錯而特錯的事情。這樣要希望他們的子女在學業上能夠有所成就，簡直等於緣木而求魚。我們希望這些家長能夠早早醒悟。使自己祇站在顧問的地位，把自己不一定正確的意見，給子女作為參考的　料，不施行絲毫的壓力。祗有這樣，才能夠達到皆大歡喜的境地。　　學校又開學了，希望莘莘學子，孜孜攻讀，準備做個有用的人。敎育安全兒童城  江新亮　　不多幾時前，美國俄亥俄州曼斯斐地方有個指揮交通的巡警，名叫巴爾斯的，在當地創立了一座安全兒童城。　　巴爾斯創立該城的起頭是這樣的：某天，他在報紙上讀到一段新聞說，有個女孩就在第一天上學校去的時候，竟無辜地被一輛汽車撞死了。這椿事感動了巴爾斯的心。他知道要使年輕的孩子懂得各項交通規則，決不能像大人那樣容易的在短時間內就可成功，他以為小孩子一定要趁平常遊戲的時候就養成遵守安全規則的習慣。那麼，為什麽不建立　座安全兒童城來使他們從玩耍中學得怎樣穿走馬路呢？　　不久之後，這座安全兒童城乃吿問世。該城佔地祗一百二十方呎；裏面備有各種遊戲的東西。此外，還有路　，停止前進的記號與紅綠燈等。這一切全由巴爾斯　人建造，祇有那盞紅綠燈他曾去請敎過一位電氣匠。隨着，他就在當地的自動車俱樂部中借得二十五　兒童脚踏汽車。同時，他又得到了曼斯斐地方的學校贊助。各學校都叫學生在課餘往該城去走走，以學得些交通規則。迄至今日，從這個小城中學得安全規則的小孩已有數千人之多。　　除了在不知不覺中令小孩養成安全的行動外，該城也叫孩子們記誦一點有關於安全的信條，像「紅綠燈是你的朋友－服從它。」與「帳在交义　穿馬路。」等等。巴爾斯對家長們的勸吿有如下的話：「你們切勿叫小孩子「不該」做　樣又「不該做那樣，孩子們所能記憶的祇是「該」如何做。」　　巴爾斯夫婦自己幷沒孩子，可是他們倆是多麽地愛護孩子的。每逢禮拜六，你總可以看到他們倆在這安全城中孜孜不倦地在幫助着孩子們怎樣開車，吿訴他們應該怎樣走路，怎樣穿馬路。　　目前，除開曼斯斐，全美國還有三個城市建有這種安全兒童城；另有三十五個則亦在攷慮中，有　當將動工建造。　　最後，讓我在這裏　誠地說一聲吧，安全兒童城的用意與目的，也是値得我們來加以注意的！文化圖書避難記  系之　　在威爾士，有一個　人禁入的煤鑛，鑛的下面最深處目前正有一個圖書館員在那裏孜孜工作；希奇得很，這樣的地方竟會有圖書館員光臨，而說到他的工作，則尤奇特了。鑛裏的長廊上，列滿了一排排的粗糙的架子，堆在上面的是那從不列顛博物院搬運出來的，價値何止數百萬元的希世書籍及手抄本。此人就把這些書籍與抄本一頁一頁地用小型膠片拍攝下來，每成一捲，就送交到美國去。　　截至目前為止，已有一百萬頁的照片安穩地渡過了大西洋了；並不曾損失過一尺的膠片。這些底片現藏在密西根大學附近的一所小磚屋裏。用這底片印出來分送各大圖書館，受到的　有一打以上了；他們都備有閱讀機，可以把膠片放成與原版本同樣的大小。　　在目前，在不列顛博物院裏的書，每一本在一五五〇年以前印行的書籍都已小心翼翼地複製成縮影型托庇於新大陸之上了。與它們一同送往的尚有其他有名的不列顛的珍藏，名目有千餘種之多。基爾荷圖書館曾送去五千頁，到彼岸後不多幾天該博物館就在納粹的炸彈之下粉碎了。　　主持這事的是姚基寳華，是一個美藉靑年影印專家。拍攝歐洲各大圖書館中的名貴版本的計劃，就是他想出來的，他是在一九三六年受洛基弗勒基金的資助，帶了一羣學者和技術人材到歐洲去的。他們冒着生命的危險，堅苦奮　從閃電戰術與野蠻主義中拯救出這一些寫的與印的，來替我們所知道的文明作個證據。　　諸君，請看人家所幹的，我們不慚愧嗎？我們上下五千年的文明，拿什麽來作它的證據呢？秋海棠  秦海鷗　　十二　意外風波　　「吳梅影家裏也不像是有錢的大戶啊！」她呻吟着說。「這件事，倒眞有些詫異！」　　「也許不是為了錢，還有別的原因也說不定。」王舍監看着年紀比她小十來歲的方校長說。　　「不錯，這是難說的。」方校長微微把頭一點。「現在我想責任的問題，我們可以完全不負；只是吳梅影那個孩子，長相旣好，人又聰明，三年來的成績，每次總在年紀比她大好幾歲的同學上面，無論她這個人是怎樣丟的，我們也不能不管。」　　方校長的話，當天便實現了。她先把那天梅寳怎樣給一個人誆出學堂去的情形寫了一封很詳細的信送給縣政府和敎育局，請求派人查訪，一面又派門房陳大立刻趕到樟樹屯去報吿梅寳的父親。　　陳大看梅寳念了三年書，那裏會想到她家裏的景况是那樣的寒素，她老子的穿着，又是那樣的破爛，同時他當然再想不到秋海棠對於這一個女兒已經看做是比性命更寳貴的東西了。因此他一找到吳家，便傾筐倒　的把所有的事全說了出來，竟使秋海棠當着他的面立刻暈了過去。　　「三爺，急也沒有用，我想姑娘是丟不了的。」張小狗子費了許多的手脚，才把他主人救解過來，一面忙着給他勸解。　　「當然丟不了，我會找孟老掌櫃的要人去！」秋海棠緩了一口氣，便立刻站起來怒冲冲地說。（二〇二）發明經濟棉屋  克忠　　美國農業部，為利用市塲上大量多餘　棉花起見，特由史壁華公司建造新式之經濟棉屋一種，在此咎房屋建造之時，盡量利用棉花以為材料。該屋寬二十四呎，長三十二呎，可在六十二小時中築造完竣。牆壁內用木板，外　以棉織物，然後再加塗油漆或壁紙。此種房屋每座計用棉花四千五百方呎，價格低廉，於必要時可隨時拆卸，運至他處再行裝置。對於軍事防守工作，極有裨益嘉言  希文　　心理學是想從人性裏獲得一種科學化的知識。－馬丁　　對自己人忠誠與對個人存偏見是同一精神特質中的兩面。－茀萊門　　人們普通多因不善辯論而口角。－却斯特頓</p>

<h3 id="e1">Victorious Counteroffensive by Chinese Forces on the Min River: Fuzhou and Lianjiang Recovered Yesterday Morning; Most Japanese Troops Fleeing Aboard Ships; Chinese Forces Continuing Advance Towards Mawei and Changmen <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Min River Front, The Chinese forces on the Min River began their counteroffensive against Fuzhou and the Jiangyou region on the 15th and 24th of last month. On the morning of the 26th, they recovered Fuqing. In the Jiangzuo region, they captured Lianjiang county seat at dawn today. The main Chinese forces have been continuously attacking for the past week, advancing to Tongkou last night and immediately moving along the river. They occupied the arsenal and Honglv Bridge at 6:30 AM this morning, and entered Fuzhou city at 8:30 AM, reaching the Nantai commercial district at 9:50 AM. They are currently pursuing rapidly towards Mawei and Changmen. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuzhou, The Japanese troops withdrew from Fuzhou and the concessions, completing their withdrawal this morning. It is expected that they will hold the area near the coastal Ma Kun. The overall situation here is currently peaceful, and all foreigners are safe. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing, Military News (1), Chinese forces attacking Fuzhou inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese when they recaptured Tongkou on the night of the 2nd. The Japanese troops in Fuzhou retreated into Japanese warships and departed on the morning of the 3rd. The scattered units that could not board the ships are being severely attacked by the Chinese. (2), On the 25th of last month, Japanese troops from Fuzhou advanced towards Xuankou and other areas via Tongkou (northwest of Fuzhou), but were repelled by the Chinese forces. Suffering significant losses, they did not dare to invade again. The Chinese forces seized this opportunity and launched a fierce attack on Fuzhou from various routes on the evening of the 2nd, capturing strongholds such as Tongkou and Xiaobeiling by midnight, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The Japanese troops inside the city were reportedly in a state of chaos, and the Chinese forces intensified their assault. (3), Japanese troops on the south bank of the Min River, after receiving reinforcements, invaded Fuqing city again on the 28th of last month. The Chinese forces besieged the city until dawn on the 2nd and had already entered the city, engaging in intense street fighting with the Japanese. (4), Chinese troops besieging Fuqing city on the south bank of the Min River captured the city on the morning of the 1st, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese until the evening, killing hundreds of Japanese. The Japanese, unable to resist, broke through and retreated east towards the port. Fuqing city was thus completely recovered by the Chinese, who continued to pursue the defeated Japanese troops fiercely. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Local News, From August 25th to 27th, the Chinese forces, starting from Yuyao, west of Ningbo, and extending to the outskirts of Nanchang, the former capital of Jiangxi province, and south to Fuqing in southern Fujian, launched probing attacks on the Japanese troops along an 890-kilometer front in sixteen routes. The purpose was to test the strength of the Japanese army. They were invincible, successively capturing two county seats and many other strongholds, and killing many Japanese soldiers. It is learned that the Japanese troops in Fuzhou, trapped in the encirclement of the Chinese forces and isolated, used the excuse of having completed their mission and withdrew from Fuzhou yesterday, boarding ships to other destinations. The spokesperson of the Japanese army and navy in this port issued a joint communiqué yesterday afternoon, announcing the matter. According to the communiqué, the Japanese troops occupied Fuzhou in early April this year and withdrew from the area this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to move elsewhere, stating that "the purpose of the Japanese army's occupation of the area was to cut off the Chongqing supply route. Now the purpose of this military action has been successfully achieved. With the full cooperation of the army, navy, and air force, they withdrew from Fuzhou. After occupying the area, the Japanese army did not damage the buildings and ordinary institutions in the area at all. Even the overseas remittances to Fuzhou were not obstructed. However, before withdrawing, they destroyed the supply routes from Fuzhou to the interior in order to prevent goods from being transported to Chongqing. The Japanese navy will step up its guard to strengthen the blockade of the area, and the troops stationed in Vietnam have sufficient forces to curb the activities in the area."</p>
<p>Fuqing County Government Has Returned to the City to Work</p>

The head of the delegation, Jiang Menglin, the deputy head, Zeng Yangfu, and Miao Jiaming were invited to stay at the Burmese Governor's residence for two days. The delegation to Burma has met with the Burmese Prime Minister and cabinet members four times, allowing ample opportunity to exchange views on various issues between China and Burma. The Burmese Governor hosted a banquet for six male members of the delegation last Saturday, accompanied by senior British and Burmese officials. The Burmese Governor and his wife will also host a banquet for the female members of the delegation tonight. The Burmese Governor proposed at the banquet that the entire table raise a glass to wish Chairman Chiang Kai-shek good health, and praised the Chinese people extensively, stating that the heroic fighting of the Chinese people has won the admiration of all countries in the world. Since the arrival of the delegation to Burma, there have been various speculations about it, with some saying that the delegation is a government delegation and that its mission is related to the Yunnan-Burma Railway. Jiang Menglin, the head of the delegation, has made two statements on this, stating that the delegation to Burma is purely a friendly visit, the purpose of which is to study Burma's progress, exchange views with Burmese leaders, and pay a return visit to the two Burmese delegations to China. Zeng Yangfu, the deputy head of the delegation, will deliver a speech on Wednesday night to explain the position of the delegation to Burma. The delegation to Burma has also made some explanations since arriving here, such as administrative and economic issues, and that with such close spiritual and cultural ties between the two countries, they are very easy to resolve under the cooperation and understanding of the two countries. Burma also deeply feels the danger of being invaded by Japan, and is therefore actively making various military preparations to prevent the unexpected. The government authorities have issued orders to evacuate residents, and Rangoon has also adopted air defense measures, but authoritative sources say that this is only a precautionary measure. The delegation to Burma visited the University of Rangoon and will be hosted by the Burmese government cabinet members tomorrow night. On Thursday, they will take a train to Mandalay and then to Lashio, and then depart from Lashio to return to China. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Rangoon, Burmese Prime Minister U Saw and other cabinet members hosted a grand banquet at the City Hall today to entertain the Chinese Goodwill Mission that arrived here. U Saw gave a speech on the spot, saying that on the day of the victory of democracy, we will find China as a great neighbor with the qualifications of a fully independent country, and as a first-class country responsible for jointly maintaining world peace. U Saw also mentioned the elimination of obstacles between China and Burma, and the establishment of air routes, which made it possible for the Goodwill Mission to be realized. Jiang Menglin, the head of the delegation, stood up and replied, saying that since the opening of the Burma Road and the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, Sino-Burmese relations have entered a new stage, which can be regarded as a sign of the beginning of Sino-Burmese economic prosperity. People here feel that the visit of the delegation has given a new impetus and new meaning to the long-standing cultural and trade relations between the two countries. The reception program has been prepared, and the Burmese journalist delegation that went to China earlier this year will also host a luncheon to entertain them. The delegation is scheduled to leave here on Thursday. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London, Chinese Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun said in a speech to the Overseas Chinese Association today that if China had stopped fighting, where would Japan's forces have developed? Countries around the world cannot imagine. From a strategic point of view, the immobility of the Japanese army in China has at least delayed the Pacific crisis, which is most concerned by politicians from the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union today, by at least three years. At the same time, the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union have also gained sufficient time to strengthen their defenses in the region. In addition to continuing its war to hinder Japan's policy of advancing south and north, China is also preparing to take on a greater responsibility in protecting democracy when Japan forces the democratic international community to the final stage. China expresses its full agreement with the ideals of other freedom-loving nations in the East and the West in the anti-aggression struggle. Although China has not formed an alliance with various freedom-loving nations, the relationship between them is growing closer. I dare to say that the cooperation between China and the various members of the British Empire is gradually increasing. This common ideal is not only a symbol of the unity of interests, but also has a profound impact on the future of the world and has the power of global unity, which will not only play a powerful role in the current anti-aggression struggle, but also in the post-war reconstruction. The Chinese government, through Foreign Minister Guo, announced its decision to fully support the eight peace goals in the Atlantic Charter. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Attitude and US-Japan Talks <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>On the 1st of this month, Mabuchi Itsuo, the chief of the press section of the Japanese Army, delivered a speech stating that Japan must break through the encirclement of the ABCD line, and if necessary, will resort to force; and that if diplomatic efforts fail, it will be forced to use force, regardless of how long the war will last, and will not hesitate to fight to the last man and reduce the land to ashes. This kind of saber-rattling rhetoric is the old tune of Japanese radicals, and is not very surprising in peacetime, but at present, the US and Japan are conducting very important diplomatic contacts. Although the content of Konoe's letter to the US President has not been revealed, it at least expresses his earnest expectations, and Mabuchi, as a spokesman for the military, suddenly issued a tough statement at this time. It is believed that this is by no means a matter of bargaining as discussed by Kiyosawa Retsu and others. On the other hand, Japan Government Information Bureau spokesman Oikawa Ikkaku said yesterday in a conversation with foreign reporters that Mabuchi's statement had nothing to do with the Japanese government's attitude towards the US-Japan talks, and advised people not to make too many speculations about Mabuchi's statement. This probably represents the attitude of the Japanese government authorities. Between the spokesmen of the Japanese government and the military, why are there such divergent views? It is difficult for outsiders to understand the news in this. What can be asserted is that under Mabuchi's statement, the future of US-Japan relations will be shrouded in a new shadow.</p>
<p>Regarding the US-Japan talks, the initiative is in the hands of the US, and the success or failure of its future depends entirely on how Japan chooses. Regarding this point, British Prime Minister Churchill's recent speech has made a clear explanation. President Roosevelt's speech on September 1, like some of his recent documents, did not mention Japan directly. This is not intentional avoidance, but to give the Japanese side a full opportunity for introspection. Its firm stance against aggression is not reserved solely for the Far East. The Japanese authorities' desire to break the deadlock in US-Japan relations has never ceased for the past three or four years, but they have not yet prepared to pay the price that the US can accept. The issuance of Konoe's letter to the US is probably the highest expression of this attempt. According to recent US news, it did not put forward any constructive suggestions. This can be seen from the general reaction of the US. Based on this, the future of the US-Japan talks, which are still in the exploratory stage, has only a very weak hope. Even if the Japanese government's attitude is more cautious, it cannot make substantial progress in US-Japan relations. Even if a certain level in Japan has deeply realized that the US-Japan deadlock must be broken, no one has openly spoken about the way to break the deadlock. What is seen in public opinion is mostly views similar to Mabuchi's speech.</p>
<p>However, even if the US-Japan talks themselves are difficult to achieve, the process of the talks can at least ease the tension in the Pacific slightly, and slightly extend the crisis that is about to break out. There is no doubt that both the US and Japan have the same demands. The US authorities have always attached importance to the Nazi threat, as can be fully seen from Roosevelt's Labor Day speech, and therefore hope that the Pacific can be at peace for the time being. However, this peace must be achieved by curbing Japan's expansionist ambitions, and it must not allow Japan to arbitrarily use its "defense circle" that reaches north to Manchuria and Mongolia and south to Vietnam. The threat of resorting to force may have resulted in the conclusion of the Bangkok Agreement and the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road in the past, but at this time it is not enough to force democratic countries to make concessions. Even if Mabuchi's views cannot represent Japanese government policy, they are at least sufficient to make the world understand the views of a group of Japanese people represented by Mabuchi. In terms of its intention, from a domestic point of view, it is nothing more than encouraging the people to prepare to use force with the determination to burn their boats, but on the other hand, this will also have a profound impression internationally, further increasing their fear and vigilance towards the future situation.</p>
<p>The silence of Washington's recent attitude proves that the talks between the US and Japan have made no progress, and it is even more difficult to hope that the crux of the matter can be resolved under the gradual revelation of Japan's impatient and tough expressions. The failure of the negotiations does not necessarily mean the outbreak of a crisis, but the negotiations this time are obviously of a final warning nature. Churchill said in his recent speech that if the US's hope of establishing a fair and peaceful solution fails, the UK will stand on the side of the US without hesitation. Churchill did not explicitly state the steps that the future cooperation between the UK and the US will take, but judging from the various trends of democratic countries in the Far East recently, it will definitely not be to continue to allow the expansion and spread of the Far East crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Hull Meets with the Press, Claims No New Developments in US-Japan Talks, White House Discusses Response to Japan <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd – President Roosevelt yesterday discussed the world situation with congressional advisors and held a lengthy meeting with Secretary of State Hull. Representative and Speaker of the House Hutter Lam stated that the congressional meeting was of a "routine" nature. He said that President Roosevelt praised the Soviet army's resistance against Germany and discussed all legislative issues.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd – Secretary of State Hull told the press yesterday that there were no new developments in the US-Japan talks. He also declined to comment on the President's response to the handwritten note from Prime Minister Konoe presented by Japanese Ambassador Nomura. He also refused to make any comment on the news reports that Japan would establish a security zone around its islands.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd – Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that there were no new developments to report regarding US-Japan relations. The ongoing talks are only exploratory. As for the rumors in Tokyo that Japan has approached the US government regarding the transportation of oil to Vladivostok, he declined to comment.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd – Some officials here, including some State Department personnel, seem to hold different opinions regarding the Far East situation. It is said that several high-ranking officials advocate that Japan retain Manchuria and Vietnam, on the condition that it completely withdraws from mainland China and restores its navy. Other officials familiar with the situation in East Asia expressed doubts about this suggestion, arguing that it is impossible to get China to concede, and even more difficult to get the Japanese military authorities to agree to withdraw from China. They also believe that if Japan is allowed to retain Manchuria and Vietnam, it will facilitate Japan's future expansion and endanger China's security. Some observers believe that the position of the United States will make it extremely difficult to propose territorial concessions to Japan, as it cannot make the same proposals to other Axis powers. This would be tantamount to abandoning some of the most important principles of anti-Axisism.</p>
<p>If Talks Fail, the Japanese Cabinet Will Be Reorganized</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 3rd – Since Japan proposed that there should be an understanding on the problems of the Pacific, it is reported that President Roosevelt held a meeting with Secretary of State Hull at the White House yesterday to discuss the wording of the US government's reply to the Japanese proposal. After the meeting with the President, Hull held a lengthy meeting with experts on Far Eastern issues in the State Department. It is generally expected that the President will reply to Prime Minister Konoe's private letter this week. However, people here still doubt whether the rift between the US and Japan has been mended. It is understood that the State Department is now working hard to find a basis for starting negotiations to reach a "standstill agreement" to prevent war in the Pacific. However, actual negotiations may not take place unless there is hope for a US-Japan agreement. Officials believe that Prime Minister Konoe is willing to stake the fate of his cabinet on reaching an understanding with the United States. If he fails, his cabinet will be replaced by a hard-line military cabinet.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd – The New East Asia Alliance Association requested Prime Minister Konoe to adopt the same sharp policy to deal with the US policy towards Japan. Its staff stated that when Japan joined the Tripartite Pact, it was determined to maintain world peace. Therefore, it is willing to do its best to end the war in China and establish a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, the United States is trying to undermine Japan's peace policy and is cooperating with Britain and the Dutch East Indies to prevent Japan from developing peacefully to the south. Japan cannot tolerate this action by Britain. The United States has recently intensified its economic pressure on Japan, while helping countries hostile to the Tripartite Pact, intending to prolong the war. At the same time, it has resolutely expanded its territorial waters, openly assisting Britain and sending troops to Iceland and Greenland. This behavior clearly violates neutrality. It is hoped that the Japanese government will continue to uphold the spirit of the Tripartite Pact, reorganize East Asia, and cut off all routes to aid the Chongqing government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Zurich, 3rd – The Basler National Zeitung's Berlin correspondent reported that Germany is quite anxious about Japan's current attitude towards the world situation, because it is rumored that Yosuke Matsuoka (one of the initiators of the Axis Tripartite Pact) resigned from the post of Foreign Minister to allow Toyoda to have the opportunity to obtain a US-Japan understanding. It is generally acknowledged that Toyoda has always advocated maintaining good relations with the United States.</p>
<p>British Opinion: No Concessions to Japan</p>
<p>London, 3rd – After Konoe sent a letter to President Roosevelt, the two sides held talks in Washington on the Far East situation. However, very little information has been received here. Before the specific content of the talks is made public, the British opinion can be summarized as follows: First, the British have no intention of making concessions. Japan's initiation of this talk proves that Japan has understood the determination of Britain and the United States and the effectiveness of the two countries' "anti-appeasement policy." Churchill has given the US President full authority in this talk, expressing absolute trust. Churchill's decision is supported by all parties. It is generally believed that this talk is a struggle between British and American public opinion and the Japanese military, and will never lead to the mistakes of retreat in the past. Second, it is generally believed that this talk can give both sides an opportunity to review the differences in their overall views. However, the meeting is extremely difficult because its promises are often not kept. Third, it is generally believed that this talk, under any circumstances, cannot make concessions for temporary security. Based on moral principles, the actions of either Britain or the United States cannot violate the spirit of Roosevelt's and Churchill's official statements, as well as the principles announced by Secretary of State Hull in 1937. Therefore, a boundary must be drawn here. If Japan oversteps the boundary, Britain and the United States should not hesitate to resort to arms. Fourth, economic sanctions cannot be relaxed, as this is the basic principle of British and American strategy in the Pacific. Fifth, based on factual evidence, China, with the strength of the Soviet Union, can hold back the invaders and should be given full trust. Therefore, any concessions and adjustments that would harm China, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies are unimaginable. The Dutch East Indies is the main source of American rubber, so it cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of the invaders. Sixth, Japan already knows that it has gained nothing from joining the Axis, and also knows that if war breaks out in the Pacific, Germany will never be able to help. If Japan requires a satisfactory settlement, its conditions will be completely different from those previously proposed. Japan should guarantee its actions, not just empty words. Seventh, Japan should be constantly monitored under the following circumstances: (1) if Japan continues its current foreign policy, (2) if Japan continues to be attached to the Axis, (3) if it continues to invade China, (4) if Japan still promotes the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," because the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is a sign of its territorial ambitions in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd – The Central Daily News editorial this morning stated that the US-Japan discussions in Washington will inevitably fail. If Japan makes concessions in the discussion, it is tantamount to Japan admitting defeat. If Japan insists on its expansion policy, the discussion will inevitably lead to a breakdown. As a result, the situation in the Pacific will become more serious.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 3rd – The Thai government yesterday issued a 2,000-word statement at the start of the third year of the European war, appealing to all belligerent and neutral countries, as well as religious, educational, and charitable institutions around the world, to do their best to promote world peace. The Thai people, being Buddhists, sincerely wish for world peace and happiness. Moved by this religious concept, they are making this appeal, and dare not belittle themselves because Thailand is small and weak. Therefore, they hope that the great powers will all immediately work to restore peace.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 3rd – According to official sources, in addition to serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Army, Thai Prime Minister Sangkram has now also been appointed as Special Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Air Force. Although the Thai Navy and Air Force already have their own Commanders-in-Chief, the appointment of Sangkram as Special Commander-in-Chief shows that this is another important step taken by Thailand in preparing for any eventuality in the current Far East crisis. Sangkram concurrently holds the three positions of Minister of Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior, but these three positions have recently been entrusted to others to take charge. Bangkok is now carrying out air defense plans, and many open spaces inside and outside the city are being used to build air raid shelters.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Rumors of Japanese Anti-Thai Prime Minister Movement <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>United Press International Correspondent Thomson, New York airmail – The Japanese peddlers of yesteryear, who walked through the forests and slept in trees at night to avoid tigers, leopards, snakes, and scorpions, were actually the ancestors of Japan's southward advance today. For the past fifty years, Japanese merchants who went to Malaya, Siam, and French Vietnam have now been replaced by large companies, with the goal of obtaining rubber, oil, and tin as their business objectives, no longer selling miscellaneous medicines. Japan now believes that the country must obtain these essential items in order to survive. If war is the only way to obtain these items, they will be willing to do so. In the four years of the Sino-Japanese War, the number of Japanese residents in China has increased from 86,000 to 510,000. As a result of recent restrictions on immigration, the number of Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines has not increased. However, Japan is now massively immigrating to French Vietnam and Thailand to develop the resources of these two places. The increase in the number of Japanese residents in China is in a ratio of six to one, which exceeds the number obtained by Japan in any country in Southeast Asia. Japanese newspapers are now paying attention to Thailand, indicating that Japan wants to obtain large-scale development and trade rights there. The Dutch East Indies has all the products that Thailand also has. It is said that Japan's southward advance to Thailand is safer than invading the Dutch East Indies, and there is less risk of triggering a war. The Japanese have organized many companies to operate in Thailand. If there is a need to increase this activity, the Japanese still have a large amount of capital to use. Japan will trample on British interests in Thailand, but hopes to avoid conflicts over money. The powerful Mitsui &amp; Co. has already been heavily involved in southern Thailand (the production area of rubber and tin), and other Japanese business enterprises have set up branches there like bamboo shoots after a rain. Japanese merchants have their own specialties there, some specializing in buying rubber, some specializing in buying tin, and some specializing in buying tungsten and iron. The British started doing business in Thailand earlier than the Japanese, and the country is adjacent to Malaya, so the British also have the advantage of being close to the water. So far, Japanese merchants can only buy 150 tons per day, and the purchase volume of rubber is about 2,000 tons per month. If Japan can control all the production of rubber and tin in Thailand, Japan's economic position can be greatly enhanced. Since Japan has large trading companies such as Mitsui absorbing rubber and tin there, the Japanese government should do its best to support it. However, how deeply they will go is still unknown. Japan is trying its best to please Thailand in order to seek better friendship. In the recent Thai-Vietnam dispute, Japan has also been the mediator. Japan has now been clearly recognized by the Vichy government as the protector of Vietnam, and in the eyes of the United States, this move is no different from another "conquest." It is also expected that the Japanese will further apply what they have applied to Vietnam to Thailand. If Thailand does not accept this "protection," Japan can create rumors in Tokyo that are unfavorable to Thai Prime Minister Sangkram, saying that he is of Chinese descent and absolutely does not sympathize with Japan's good intentions. The Japanese are extremely dissatisfied with the restrictions on immigration in the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, and a certain Japanese writer even calls it a shortsighted policy. It is said that the development of certain aspects has proven that the wisdom and hard work of the Japanese are the only way to improve the general situation. The population of Japanese in French Vietnam has increased from 234 to dozens after the Japanese navy, army, and merchants invaded the country. The Japanese hope to absorb from Vietnam, food, vegetables, coal, tin and iron. At one time, they also needed sand, and said that the sand must be exported from Cam Ranh Bay and loaded into Japanese ships. At that time, the French laughed it off, and it became an argument. However, the Japanese have now apparently obtained their sand. Wood is produced in the Southeast Asian region, and Japan needs wood to make wood chips for rayon and other fiber products. There are about 36 trading companies in Southeast Asia that deal in rubber, but they only represent a small part of the total production. Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is only one-twentieth of Japan's total investment, so they think this number is too small. What will Japan do in Southeast Asia? What the Japanese have done in China can be used as an example. The way the Japanese do business in China is to buy more than 51% of all shares in each factory, and then act arbitrarily, as if the factory is already theirs, and call it "Sino-Japanese joint venture." The increase in the population of Japanese residents in China is greater in North China and other areas. They enter the area, first with armed forces to "appease" the residents, and then merchants follow. There are now 350,000 Japanese residents in North China, while before July 7, 1937, there were only more than 43,000. The number of Japanese travelers in the East has always been bewildering to foreigners. The ships from Kobe to Shanghai, from Kobe to Dalian, from Kobe to Tianjin, and from Kobe to Qingdao are always overcrowded. The trains passing through Korea between China and Japan are full every day. This phenomenon has occurred since the July 7th Incident, revealing the efforts of the Japanese to run around.</p>

<p>Singapore, 2nd – Alan, the former second secretary of the British Embassy in China, recently came here to serve as the assistant to Twigule, the special representative of the British War Cabinet in the Far East. According to reports, since the Yunnan-Burma Road has become China's important lifeline, Sino-Burmese relations have become closer. China is ready to fight Japan indefinitely, and negotiations for peace are impossible. The rise of public morale in Chongqing is truly amazing. Regarding the possibility of Malaya being involved in the war, Alan said that if Japan wants to attack Malaya, it will inevitably suffer great difficulties. They must recognize that our position in the Far East has greatly strengthened. The people of Chongqing all hope that the United States will join the war. They believe that if Japan insists on advancing south, the United States must take firm action.</p>

<p>United Press International, Singapore, 3rd – The Governor of Malaya, Thomas, recently made a special broadcast to commemorate the second anniversary of the European War, warning the people that Japan has gradually approached Malaya, and strongly stated that although Britain is not fighting in the Far East, if it is attacked, it will fight until victory. He made a general review of the current situation and ended his speech with a comment on recent events in the Far East. He said that the people of Malaya are the luckiest in the world today. So far, Malaya is still far away from the war, taxes are still very low, and living conditions continue as usual. However, it is difficult for us to predict how long this state of tranquility can be maintained. Next, Japan has gradually approached Malaya, and its troops in southern Vietnam are located on the border of Thailand. Japan has announced that it is part of the Axis powers. We should not ignore this fact, and continued that the third year of the war seems to be a dangerous period for Malaya, because Germany still has terrible power today. We do not want a war in the Far East, but we need peace and a firm and united front to resist aggression and protect peace. If we are attacked, we will rise up and fight until victory.

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd – The Japanese paper Kokumin Shimbun published an article saying that the Japanese authorities responsible for defense will regard any effort to establish a military aircraft flight line between the Americas and the Asian continent as a problem of the first order of international importance. The paper pointed out that the recent flight of two Soviet aircraft across the Bering Sea to the United States has the potential to cause future danger, saying that as aviation conveniences become increasingly developed, flights between Alaska and Kamchatka are becoming increasingly important in the route to oppress Japan. Therefore, Japan should re-examine its defense position.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd – The War Department stated yesterday that the 47 Soviet personnel who landed in Nome, Alaska, and transited through the United States were a "purely technical delegation" to study the manufacture of warplanes and major aircraft factories. News from San Diego said that five Soviet military and embassy personnel arrived without prior announcement from Washington, with the aim of meeting with Major Fleet, general manager of "Consolidated Aircraft", "or purchasing the Consolidated Aircraft's long-range bombers."</p>

<h3 id="e26">Continuous Rain and Muddy Roads, Battle for Leningrad Begins, Germany Claims to Break Through Outer Perimeter but This is Not Confirmed, Red Army Launches Fierce Counterattack and Achieves Success <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 3rd – According to the Svenska Dagbladet's Berlin correspondent, well-informed sources "believe that the battle for Leningrad has already begun." The Nazis claim that their troops have broken through the outer defense line of the city at several points and the vanguard has reached the suburbs, and the final attack is expected to be launched at any time. Other Berlin correspondents did not mention this statement, only saying that continuous rain hindered the march, and that Soviet troops south of Lake Ilmen continued to be "annihilated." The Germans claim that the large-scale encirclement operation is proceeding smoothly north of Novgorod (two miles north of Lake Ilmen). The Germans also admitted that the Soviet army in the central region launched repeated counterattacks, but said that they "did not achieve their goals," and the Soviet army's repeated attempts to retake the west bank of the Dnieper River were also unsuccessful. Also, the Swedish newspaper's Finnish correspondent reported that the Soviet army is now guarding the Stalin Line across the Karelian Isthmus. Finnish sources reported that Finnish troops have occupied Sakkola, 50 miles southeast of Vyborg, and advanced to Taipale east of Sakkola.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Stockholm, 3rd – According to German sources, the country's troops are stepping up the encirclement of Leningrad, and its vanguard has advanced to Krasnoselskoye, only 18 miles from Leningrad. Further south, a German army has advanced from Luga, 30 miles from Leningrad.</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 3rd – The German High Command announced today that it had won victories on both the northern and southern lines. On the northern line, German troops were only 20 miles from Leningrad, and on the southern line, Romanian troops had cut off the water supply to Odessa. The Soviet army launched fierce counterattacks, especially in the central line and the Dnieper River area, but they were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German Air Force repeatedly carried out devastating bombings on the southern railway line of Moscow, and the German Navy has invaded the Gulf of Finland near Kronstadt and Leningrad. The German High Command also confirmed that the Soviet army had destroyed the Dnieper River dam.</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 3rd – According to reports from Berlin and Moscow, a new and fierce battle broke out yesterday on the German-Soviet front and is in progress. The exact developments are being kept secret by both sides. The Red Army launched a fierce counterattack along Smolensk in the central area, led by 52-ton tanks, in an attempt to destroy the German army, because the German army has been blocked on the road to enter Moscow. In the south, the Soviet Union is thinking of using river warships and low-deck armored ships to land on the west bank of the Dnieper River. The German army claims that the attack has been blocked. The Soviet counterattack has apparently not reduced the German pressure on the northern line. Here, the German army claims to have defeated the Soviet army protecting the road from Luga to Leningrad. Reliable sources said that it will take several days to clarify the trend of the war, but they all believe that the strong resistance of the Soviet army is enough to extend the war into the winter. Moscow claimed that the 170th division of the German army attacking the Soviet Union has been annihilated, and said that the German army has a total of 2 million dead and wounded.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Admits Abandoning Tallinn</p>
<p>United Press International, Moscow, 3rd – Last night, the official source of information admitted that the Soviet Red Army had abandoned Tallinn, the main port of the Gulf of Finland.

<p>United Press International, Stockholm, 3rd – It is believed here yesterday that after Finnish and German troops occupied Haapsalu on the west coast of Estonia, they will launch a large-scale attack on Ösel Island and Dagö Island. The only bases in Estonia that are still in the hands of the Soviet army are the two islands. Soviet radio said that the German army had previously used paratroopers to attack and failed, and said that the two islands had been repeatedly bombed since the start of the war. After the Soviet army occupied the two islands in the autumn of 1939, they built airfields and forts on them.</p>
<p>More Than One Million Tons of Romanian Oil Destroyed</p>

<p>Reuter's, Helsinki, 2nd - Official sources have announced that Finnish troops have reached the city of Belostrov and are only nineteen miles from Leningrad. The old borders have been completely restored. The line from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Finland, that is, the border between the two countries before the Finnish-Soviet Peace Treaty of March 1940, has now been re-established.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 3rd - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky stated at a press conference yesterday that Finland has suffered heavy losses and is seeking peace. However, the rumors that the Soviet Union and Finland have already negotiated an armistice "do not correspond to the facts."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 3rd - Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the rumor that U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant participated in the Soviet-Finnish peace talks is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 3rd - The Finnish people clearly desire peace, but well-informed Swedish sources believe that the war on the Eastern Front will continue, and Finland will not be able to obtain peace. When the Finnish Parliament met yesterday, the speaker said, "We Finns are now seeking guarantees of victory and peace for the future, and are prepared to work for peace after ensuring security." A well-known military commentator, Colonel White, wrote in a certain newspaper here, "The Finnish campaign has come to an end, and Finland's struggle to obtain a secure border may continue." A dispatch from Berlin published in a Swedish newspaper stated that responsible persons in Berlin said that the rumors of Finnish peace were merely a "clumsy conspiracy" because Finland had no reason to seek peace at this time of "victorious advance." The Finnish side is now in great need of food, and they are as eager for peace as they are because they are experiencing a severe food shortage. Observers believe that Germany is preparing to supply food to Finland in order to keep them fighting.</p>

At the same time, negotiations between the British and Soviet ambassadors and the Iranian government are continuing.

<p>Reuters, Edinburgh, 3rd - The British Trade Union Congress met here yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution: (1) to welcome the British-Soviet alliance; (2) for the trade union movement to do its utmost to supply the Soviet Union with munitions and other materials from Britain; (3) to approve the proposal made by the Administrative Council of the Trade Union Congress to form a British-Soviet Trade Union Conference composed of an equal number of representatives from the British and Soviet Trade Union Congresses. When the Secretary-General of the Congress introduced this motion, he stated that some might say that the British Trade Union Congress's proposal contained a communist flavor, but this statement was absurd. It must be understood that its attitude towards communism has already been clearly expressed. We are not prepared to cooperate with the British Communist Party in any way. We feel that they are completely unreliable and cannot implement any policy.</p>

<p>Reuters, Canberra, 3rd - The new Australian Prime Minister spoke today on the second anniversary of the start of the war, saying that the Axis powers' hope of expanding the war to the Far East to contain the British Empire has disappeared. Australia's slogan for the coming year will be to more thoroughly understand that unity is strength and that the preservation of democracy is more important than everything else. There are still many thorns in the future, but the enormous material power is really beneficial to the British Empire, and the tanks, aircraft, and all the war equipment supplied by the United States are also increasing day by day. This kind of cooperation is a thrilling feature. The British Empire forces in the Near East and the Middle East are now rapidly strengthening. Looking forward to the future, there is a sense of certainty.</p>

Last night's artillery fire clearly indicated that all available anti-aircraft guns were in action. The official communiqué used the word "concentrated" in describing the anti-aircraft fire, which was carefully selected because the sky was filled with the loud noise of various artillery fires, and the windows of the houses were violently shaking.</p>

<p>In recent months, the small-ball community has held numerous charity matches, such as the Hua Lian Cup, Pei Zhi Cup, Yong Ye Cup, and Coco Cup, to raise funds for various charities. These events have been very popular, embodying charity in sports, and are of profound significance. The righteousness of the ball players and the generosity of philanthropists are admirable. Mr. Chen Linsheng recently spoke with Mr. Song Deyi of the Relief for the Blind Association about the recent situation of the association. It is said that humans suffer from disabilities, and among the disabled, the deaf, mute, blind, and visually impaired are like people in hell. It is believed that the sports community in Shanghai has not yet provided relief to the blind and visually impaired. Mr. Chen was saddened by this and agreed to donate the ticket revenue from the Hardball Cup finals to the association's expenses. In addition, he appealed on behalf of the sports community, hoping that a portion of the proceeds from the cup competition will be allocated for relief, which would be good news for the deaf, mute, blind, and visually impaired.</p>

<p>The yarn market started high and then remained flat, but the trend is still upward. This is because rising shipping costs are causing profit-takers to close out positions. Therefore, once the market loosens, it reacts and falls. However, large players with ample financial resources are not giving up on absorbing volume. However, sales by Hong Kong merchants are not as prosperous as in previous days. Yet, another 1,905 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today, and spot prices remain solid, mainly because raw materials are still expensive. As for the shorts, in view of the stalled US-Japan negotiations, they are considering covering their positions. Therefore, the current situation is still tied up. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,719 yuan, and the low price was 1,697 yuan. The market opened flat in the afternoon at 1,706 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange price was weak, falling back to 1,698 yuan. The closing price then recovered to 1,706 yuan. As for the situation of 20-count Japanese yarn, it was quite firm. The trading of 20-count Blue Phoenix Yueqin yarn was particularly active, because its inventory was relatively thin. There was also a reduction in the work force. The morning market for yarn, building on the high momentum of the previous afternoon, continued to advance. The opening price was 1,715 yuan. At this time, scattered shorts covered, rising to 1,919 yuan. Unexpectedly, profit-takers sold off, and coupled with the exchange's second session falling back, the market sentiment loosened, falling ten yuan to 1,708-9 yuan. This session revolved for a long time, but the spot yarn market was mediocre, and the market trend was weak, continuously softening to 1,697 yuan. The 700 yuan level was broken. Those covering their positions crowded in, rising again to 1,708-9 yuan. However, new buyers still lacked interest, and the sentiment was scattered. The closing price was 1,705 yuan. The statistics for transactions in the first half of the day totalled 7,045 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed below: Hong Kong 45, Fellow Traders 7,000. Total 7,045</p>

<p>The Jinma futures market again suffered a setback, and the rise in foreign cotton had no effect. This is because rumors that international negotiations between the United States and Japan had not made significant progress inevitably made the bulls nervous. Therefore, the small fluctuations in factory orders caused the yarn futures market to fluctuate and soften. When the market opened in the morning, scattered shorts slightly covered. The September contract opened at 1,612 yuan, still gaining 6 yuan. The October contract was at 1,648 yuan, immediately showing signs of weakness. The November contract was at 1,660 yuan, also slightly decreasing. Although it once rebounded by three to five yuan due to the buying of floating shorts, it soon turned weak due to the continuous decline of the exchange. The noon closing price for the September contract was 1,611 yuan, the October contract was 1,646 yuan, and the November contract was 1,658 yuan, each with slight differences. In the afternoon, it hovered and remained sluggish, but there were many large players who had been lying dormant who absorbed at low prices. Therefore, the market sentiment was soft but stable. As a result, the September contract was 1,614 yuan, slightly decreasing by one yuan at the close. The October contract was 1,600 yuan, falling by three yuan. The November contract was 1,659 yuan, falling by as much as 7.50 yuan. Judging from the trend, without special optimism, there may still be fluctuations. The total daily turnover was 15,440 bales, a decrease of 2,550 bales compared to the previous day. As of the evening of the 2nd, the three-month inventory was 22,670 bales, of which 7,130 bales were for the September contract, 8,700 bales were for the October contract, and 6,840 bales were for the November contract. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the day are recorded on the left (net prices).</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw that HSBC's listed price and small counter price remained unchanged. Citibank's small counter price was still 4.75 yuan. The black market for British and American exchange rates had stopped tightening and slightly eased. This was because coal settlements had decreased, and foreign banks such as British merchants were not hoarding as much as in the previous two days. In the end, both exchange rates slightly eased, and transactions were sparse. It was heard that some Chinese merchants had slightly sold Hong Kong exchange. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>From the morning, foreign telegrams showed that British, American, and Indian silver markets and British-American foreign exchange rates had not changed. The central government's approved exchange rates were also flat. The opening bank selling price for spot British exchange was 2 shillings 8.28125 pence, and the US dollar was 4.75 yuan, both the same as the previous day's closing price. The import coal companies first called for 4.78125 yuan for spot US dollars. The silver balance tax was still levied at 24.50%. The banks' willingness to supply was slightly better, resulting in cheap coal companies settling at 4.8125 yuan. Later, a certain American bank absorbed a certain group of Chinese merchants' current Hong Kong exchange rate at 79 yuan. After 10 o'clock, the trend became stagnant until the noon close, with the US dollar at 4.8125 yuan and the British exchange rate also hardening to 2 shillings 8.4375 pence, higher than the previous day's closing price by 0.0625 for the US dollar and 0.015625 for the British exchange rate.</p>

<p>Yesterday's black market for raw silk still traded spot goods. Because gold shops supplied more than demand, small money shops and silver shops sold off, the market showed a trend of rising first and then falling. After the price broke through 9,200 yuan, it immediately fell back, and finally slightly decreased by 10 yuan. About 200 taels were traded in the first half of the day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Regarding futures, it has been decided to use eight types of substitutes, such as British and American gold pound notes, to settle the price. Before the black market for foreign exchange is completely eliminated, the average price of the HSBC small counter US dollar exchange rate and the black market US dollar exchange rate on the day will be temporarily used to settle the price. For example, based on yesterday afternoon's market price, the HSBC small counter US dollar exchange rate was 5.3125 yuan, and the black market US dollar exchange rate was 4.8125 yuan. The average price was 5.0625 yuan, and the new settlement price was 6,879 yuan and 0 points. The outstanding chips at the end of each month will be settled at that price. Swaps will be opened as usual on the 14th of each month. It has been decided to open the market as usual today, and the market price should be between 6,800 yuan and 6,900 yuan.</p>

Dingsheng bought 10 taels from Shunyuan for 9,240 yuan. Then, Chengji continued to sell, and the price fell back. It sold 20 taels to Tianyuan and 10 taels to Xianghe for 9,209 yuan. Tianyuan then resold, falling back to within 9,200 yuan, selling 20 taels to a certain silver shop, and Xianghe resold to Jingfu for 10 taels, both for 9,190 yuan.

<p>Recently, foreign rice, which has been declining, has aroused a wave of short covering after the previous sharp fall, and after a temporary rebound, yesterday in the early market, general sellers held their goods without selling, and the speculative business of floating hoarders and retail investors was also quite active. At that time, the situation was particularly bleak. The price of Xiaojiao rice continued to rise. If the bank warehouse opened to 114 yuan, the foreign warehouse opened to 113 yuan, and the second-grade rice also opened to 112 yuan. However, the actual sales of local shops and stores were still not smooth. Once the market price was raised, profitable floating investors immediately took advantage of the high prices to sell, and original root customers no longer held on. Moreover, the US-Japan relationship was still half-hearted, and neither southward nor northward advances would be realized for a while. Japan hoped to overcome this difficulty, conserve its energy, and dominate East Asia in one fell swoop in the future. Therefore, the situation in Nanyang eased again, and people's hearts changed immediately. There was also a lot of advantageous selling, and it was rumored that the production prices of foreign rice were jointly planned, and trading companies directly placed orders. It was also said that several deals had been reached, and the selling sentiment was gradually strong. The price of Xiaojiao rice was lowered to 111.5 yuan and 112 yuan. The price of No. 1 rice ranged from 127 yuan to 125 yuan. As a result, it was weaker than the previous day. The current price of No. 2 Siamese rice from Yinghua Company was 127 yuan, the current price of Xiaojiao rice was 141 yuan and 141.5 yuan, the old goods in the large market were 135 yuan, pure rice ranged from 100 yuan to 99 yuan, and the price of crushed rice from the Public Works Department was 97 yuan. It was popular at first and then tired, and the closing price was similar to the previous market. It is estimated that 8,000 bags were traded, and Yinghua Company traded 6 tons.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source of thick and thin japonica rice was cut off, and the monthly focus on rice was tight. People's hearts suddenly turned upward again. Local shops and stores acted as customers, seemingly afraid of being left out, and competed to do business, which stimulated the owners to hoard goods and act presumptuously. The shouting was as if they were dancing, and the market price suddenly rose by three to four yuan. It is estimated that the price of early white rice from Nangang was 59.7-158 yuan, Wuxi special white japonica rice was 158 yuan, the large market was 152 yuan, and the middle market was 148 yuan. As for the new japonica rice from Pudong, the arrival of goods was also scarce. Therefore, in this excellent situation, everything rose with it, and the selling price opened at 160 yuan and 159 yuan.</p>

<p>After the two consecutive declines in glutinous rice, there was some sporadic appetite, so the market color also became stable, without any changes. It continued to sell Hong Kong white glutinous rice for 126 yuan, then to 120 yuan, and special glutinous rice for 128 yuan. High-quality glutinous tea started from 114 yuan, then to 110 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Moscow Situation at the Outbreak of War <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Alice Leone Moats, a female reporter dispatched by the American magazine "Collier's Weekly," arrived in Moscow two weeks before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. She witnessed the situation in the Russian capital at the outbreak of the war, providing a fresh perspective. This is her first wireless telegraph report, translated and recorded below:</p>
<p>On the morning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, a diplomat told his female servant, Hu, that war had broken out. Upon hearing this news, she replied with a fatalistic attitude typical of Slavic people, "If it has started, let it start." Saying this, she put on the skirt she wore for cleaning and went to work as usual.</p>
<p>This perfectly reflects the attitude of the entire Soviet people towards the war. The peaceful atmosphere in Moscow at that time was truly extraordinary. There was hardly any sign of panic or commotion. Even when the German ambassador was still in Moscow, there were no public demonstrations in front of the embassy. Citizens went about their business as usual. Except for the nightly blackouts, the large groups of reservists rushing to recruitment centers, and everyone carrying gas masks, Moscow was no different from usual.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on June 22nd, a friend from a foreign embassy woke the reporter with a phone call, urging her not to go on the planned hiking trip. He said that the British Broadcasting Corporation had just reported that German troops had invaded the Soviet Union at 4:00 AM, and that German Ambassador Schulenburg had gone to the Kremlin at 5:30 AM to formally declare war. The reporter's hotel was very close to the Kremlin, and fearing being caught in the crossfire during bombing raids, she packed her bags and decided to move to a friend's house. At noon, loudspeakers installed on rooftops throughout the city broadcast Molotov's speech, telling the Soviet people that they had been at war for eight hours with a country with which they had signed a non-aggression pact two years ago.</p>
<p>The reporter carried her luggage into the lobby and saw that the cars for business trips in front of the hotel had mysteriously disappeared. Many people were lined up, waiting for a car. The reporter also booked a car, but after an hour, it still hadn't arrived, so she left her luggage and started walking. On the way, she stopped at the American Embassy and saw that most of the staff had already dispersed to the countryside to work, according to pre-arranged plans. The ambassador's residence had also been moved to a place 26 miles outside the city. Many foreign embassies had also made similar preparations and had sent women, children, and essential staff to the countryside a week earlier.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's experience, such situations often lead to chaos, and she expected the citizens of Moscow to panic and rush to escape. However, the scene on the streets was like a normal Sunday holiday. As she walked along, she felt that the general situation was calm as usual. The only noise she heard was the loudspeaker announcing the complete implementation of blackouts in the Moscow area and various air defense regulations. The pedestrians' faces showed no sign of panic, and they were expressionless. The reporter carefully investigated the reason for this, initially suspecting it was due to shock. But later, when she talked about it with a British person, he said that Russians are often so indifferent. Along the way, some people were standing together, discussing the news, but most people were still going about their usual business.</p>
<p>However, one thing was a special phenomenon, which was that within a few hours of the outbreak of the war, they had changed their previous distrust of foreigners. Whenever the reporter smiled and nodded to someone, they would stop and start chatting with the reporter. When the reporter said that she didn't understand Russian, they would often ask if she spoke German. The reporter quickly explained that she was American and then replied that she could speak German. They spoke about Germany's violence and betrayal of trust, using many harsh words, but they were very confident about the outcome of the war and showed no doubt whatsoever. Although Kiev and other places had been attacked and news of 200 civilian casualties had been heard, they were certain that enemy planes would not be able to approach the capital to carry out bombings. The reporter asked everyone she met if the news of the outbreak of the war was a complete surprise to them. They all replied that although there had been rumors of a German-Soviet conflict in the past two weeks, no one believed it would actually happen. One woman even said that the war would not last long. When the reporter asked her why, she said, "Because he's not a fool!" The reporter asked, "Who isn't a fool?" She replied, "Hitler." After saying that, she left. The reporter is still puzzled by the true meaning of her words.</p>
<p>The mobilized reservists went to the military stations to report, all carrying gas masks, and many also carried water bags. Civilians did not panic when they saw them. On the first day, people lined up in front of savings banks and grocery stores, scrambling to buy sugar, sweet potatoes, flour, and pasta.</p>
<p>The next day, the authorities announced that there was enough food, and the public bought food as usual. Later, the only people seen lined up were those waiting in front of Lenin's tomb to pay their respects, and those in front of stores selling maps and newsstands. There were also many people in front of the post office, each carrying a radio to deposit, but each household still had loudspeakers, broadcasting programs from government radio stations.</p>
<p>There were particularly many people waiting to buy the "Moscow Evening News," which was characterized by various advertisements. That night, the reporter noticed that everyone who bought the newspaper would turn to the last page to read the advertisements as soon as they got it. In this time of crisis, they were still relaxed and concerned about everyday matters, which was quite remarkable. The outbreak of the war was during the off-season for theaters in Moscow, but there were still five theaters performing operas and comedies. The circus that had just opened also continued to perform, with every show fully booked. Cinemas were also doing well, and the films currently being shown were all war films, patriotic films, historical films about Russia's victory over Germany, and anti-fascist films. Newspapers had also mentioned Chaplin's "The Great Dictator," praising it as the best film, and there was talk of bringing it to Moscow for showing.</p>
<p>Restaurants and nightclubs also adhered to the principle of "business as usual." The grand dining room of the Hotel Metropol was full of ladies every night. Although blackouts were in effect, people were still dancing and enjoying themselves under the dim green lights. Last night, the reporter visited the famous Caucasus Restaurant. The scene was no different from her previous visits. The Caucasian music and dance were as lively and exciting as before. The reporter then ordered exquisite dishes and fine wine and enjoyed a delicious meal.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 22nd, the reporter drove around Moscow to see the situation during wartime. She saw that the blackout was strict and effective, which was surprising. The whole city, in the grayish-white light of the summer night, was more beautiful than usual when the streetlights were on. (Moscow is completely dark only from midnight to 2:00 AM in the summer night). No light came out of any windows. The police held covered red and green lights to direct traffic, and the streets had the atmosphere of Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The next day, the radio station announced that seven people had been arrested for violating the blackout rules the previous night. Citizens believed that a German air raid was very likely, so on the first day and night of the war, they had hung thick curtains and blackouts. Even more cautious people had completely nailed blue curtains to the windows, so they couldn't open the windows during the day either. From morning to night, they couldn't see the light of day and had to grope around in the dark.</p>
<p>The night patrol team changed shifts every three hours and carefully checked each house for any light leaks. The reporter's friend was warned for turning on the light at 3:00 PM. Someone in the countryside had a white dog, and the patrol team also asked to dye the dog's fur black. Strips of cloth had been glued to the windows to prevent the glass from shattering. Every household had also dug air-raid shelters in the courtyards. Sandbags for extinguishing fires were placed next to the staircases in apartments and buildings. The tenants of each apartment had to take turns guarding the night, paying attention to air-raid sirens, and waking others. Airplanes patrolled the city's airspace day and night. On June 23rd, the rooftops and squares of the city were full of anti-aircraft guns. Hospitals had all been moved to the countryside. However, trains and buses continued to run as usual. According to the reporter's reliable information, train traffic had never been interrupted.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the military authorities announced martial law, urging the public not to travel on the streets, whether by car or on foot, from midnight to 4:00 AM. Theaters, restaurants, and other public places had to close at 10:45 PM every night and were not allowed to sell "Vodka." At 3:00 AM on the 27th, the reporter was awakened by the sound of an alarm and was able to see the strictness of Moscow's preparations. The reporter woke up, immediately put on her clothes, and went to the courtyard to see what was happening. A few people hurried past on the street, but they didn't seem very panicked. Then the buzzing sound of airplanes was heard. Looking up, the nearby anti-aircraft guns had already opened fire. The reporter quickly ran back to the house and hid in the basement, where the servants had gathered. The Russians and Tatars among them were very calm, but the Germans from the Volga River region were uneasy and restless. Anti-aircraft guns and machine guns continued to fire fiercely, but it was strange that no bombs were heard falling and exploding. At one point, it seemed like a bomb had fallen nearby, but it turned out that a neighbor had run out in his pajamas, and the door had suddenly closed. Then he used an ax to break down the door, making a loud noise.</p>
<p>The next day, the newspaper announced that this was just a practical air-defense drill to test the effectiveness of air defenses.</p>
<p>On the first day of the war, almost all of western Soviet territory was under martial law, and all administration was taken over by the military authorities. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet also authorized the military authorities to conscript civilians at any time to carry out defense, firefighting, and epidemic prevention work, guarding transportation, communications, and power plants. The military authorities also had the power to adjust trade, plan food distribution, restrict travel, and expel undesirable elements.</p>
<p>Parachute defense teams had been formed, and each village had a police station equipped with rifles and other weapons. Anyone who saw a paratrooper had to report to the police station and summon the villagers to take up their weapons and immediately go to war. On the 26th, the military authorities ordered all government agencies and factories to extend the daily working hours from eight hours to one to three hours. Overtime work was paid half wages. Holidays were also canceled. For those who had been mobilized for military service, those who left one person at home would receive a monthly allowance of 100 rubles, those who left two people would receive a monthly allowance of 150 rubles, and those who left three or more people would receive a monthly allowance of 200 rubles.</p>
<p>The jobs left behind by men who had joined the army were mostly taken over by women. Some women also wanted to enlist, but the authorities did not approve because there were enough men in the Soviet Union. There are now 50 million women working on the front and rear lines, including 19 million engaged in agriculture, 11 million working in factories and government agencies, and the rest joining rescue teams, driving buses and trams, directing traffic, or serving as air-defense personnel.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the war, the Soviet authorities only issued war reports once in the morning, but from the 28th, they held two press conferences a day, at 1:00 PM and 11:00 PM, with Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky as the official spokesman. The venue was the newly established Information Bureau. War reports were previously issued by the General Headquarters, but now they are issued by the Information Bureau. The Information Bureau's address was formerly a foreign embassy. When reporters first attended the press conference, they couldn't help but remember that they had previously attended very lively diplomatic banquets there, and they couldn't help but feel a sense of incongruity at this time and place.</p>
<p>Lozovsky had a long, gray beard, and his eyes were bright and sharp under thick eyebrows, revealing his shrewdness and competence. He first spoke in Russian, and news reporters who understood Russian translated it into English and relayed it to their colleagues. When reporters asked questions, Lozovsky answered in French. (He also knew a little English and said that he would be able to speak fluent English in a few months). Lozovsky answered questions straightforwardly and quickly, with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Soviet newspapers reacted to various situations very calmly. The newspapers published war news very frankly, without exaggerating victories or concealing defeats. "Pravda" can represent general public opinion. It is said that all Soviet people should not be proud of victory, nor discouraged by defeat, and should not hold the misconception that victory is easy. To fight a treacherous and changeable enemy, it is necessary to make great sacrifices and efforts. The newspapers also encouraged the people with the fact that Russia had defeated the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century and Napoleon's army in 1812.</p>
<p>A general wrote an article in "Izvestia" saying that the notion that the German army was invincible was absurd. The reason why Germany has succeeded so often is that the invaded countries had fifth columnists helping them. But the Soviet Union had foresight and had purged these people more than three years ago.</p>
<p>Newspapers did not publish many reports on the vivid details of the battles or the heroic deeds of the soldiers. Most of the anti-German propaganda criticized Hitler's perfidy. Outside the shop windows on the streets, people gathered, looking up to watch anti-German posters and caricatures. The city walls were all plastered with slogans excerpted from Molotov's declaration of war. Large cartoons were also posted on the high walls, one depicting a Red Army soldier holding a gun and stabbing Hitler, with Hitler's head piercing through the broken paper of the Soviet-German pact. Another picture showed a large cannonball smashing Hitler into pieces, with the slogan "Crush Fascist Barbarism" written on the ball. (End)</p>

<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education has always attached great importance to physical education training in secondary and higher schools. In addition to formulating a plan for the implementation of physical education and issuing it to all schools for earnest implementation, so as to train students' physical fitness, it has recently also considered the changes in the situation and determined that there are many points that need to be improved in the physical education training of various schools in the future. Special improvement points have been formulated and issued to secondary and higher schools for earnest implementation. Among them, the cultivation of young people's endurance and applied skills, and the joint management of social physical education by secondary and higher schools are very important. The improvement points for physical education in secondary and higher schools are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The physical education administrative organizations of public and private secondary and higher schools should immediately establish and implement the methods issued by the Ministry. (2) Schools should carefully select physical education teachers, with character, ability, and skills being the important standards for selection and appointment. (3) Each school should review and revise its physical education administrative plans, methods, records, and regulations, and submit them to the competent educational administrative authority for approval before the start of the school year. (4) Physical education funding should be completed within three years according to the provisions of the plan. Those with special difficulties may adopt the method of gradually reducing student physical education fees and simultaneously increasing school operating expenses. (5) The enrichment of physical education equipment should be planned and submitted for approval and implementation. (6) In addition to the provisions of the implementation plan, there should be at least two hours of physical education class per week, which should not be arbitrarily reduced or taken advantage of by other means. (7) Physical education teaching materials should be carefully selected according to local environmental and equipment conditions. All training methods that can cultivate young people's endurance and applied skills, such as long-distance running, races, horseback riding, cycling, rowing, gliding, and parachuting, should be fully selected. Ball sports should not take up too much time in regular classes. (8) All students, except those who have been approved for exemption, must participate in morning exercises and extracurricular sports, and should be properly guided and assigned according to their abilities and interests. All school instructors and discipline office personnel have the responsibility of management and supervision. (9) Sports competitions should be held immediately and students should be urged to participate widely. (10) Camping and travel should be actively promoted during holidays, with at least one event each year. The number of participants in each event should be at least 20% of the total number of students in the school. (11) Health checkups must be carried out in accordance with the regulations, paying attention to the physical changes of each student. (12) Physical education grades of secondary school students should be included in the calculation of overall academic performance. (13) Secondary and higher schools should also jointly manage social physical education, striving to eliminate the boundaries between schools and society, so that school physical education and social physical education are integrated, so as to achieve greater results. The points to be noted for jointly managing social physical education are as follows: (1) Secondary and higher schools should be jointly managed by the physical education department or the physical education and health group together with the academic affairs office or the guidance group. (2) Secondary and higher schools should try their best to open up sports fields and equipment for public use. (3) Secondary and higher schools can use students who are rich in leadership talents and good at sports techniques to organize and guide the public who come to exercise, and engage in fitness exercises, martial arts, and other games and sports. (4) Secondary and higher schools should hold public sports meetings and physical education performances, or add a public group when holding their own school sports meetings, in order to promote and arouse public attention and interest.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Parents of Public School Students of the Shanghai Municipal Council Dissatisfied with Tuition Increase <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News", it is learned from all parties yesterday (the 1st) that the parents of the students of the Public School of the Shanghai Municipal Council are quite dissatisfied with the increase in tuition fees from this semester. It is expected that they will file a protest with the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council within a few days. According to the general opinion of the parents, the tuition fees of the Public School have increased too much. It is expected that many parents will not be able to afford it and will not let their children study in the Public School again. The subsidy method implemented by the Council does not help much. Now the tuition fee has risen to about 120 yuan, which can be said to be extremely high. There must be no lack of those who have difficulty raising money. Therefore, it is expected that the parents will protest to the Investigation Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and ask them to consider this situation immediately. Furthermore, all countries provide free primary education to the children of taxpayers. The Public School run by the Shanghai Municipal Council must charge taxpayers tuition fees. When the reporter asked the director of the Information Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council about this issue, he replied that the Council had studied this matter, but it would not reduce tuition fees. Those who really cannot afford to pay can apply for subsidies.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Grand International Mini Football Match; Hualian Defeats Portugal in Two Battles; Li Yiju's Nine-Yard Kick Determines the Victory; The Result is 1-0; No Records in the First Half <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In the Weldon International Mini-Football Tournament, Hualian met Portugal at the Jiaozhou Road Poor Children's Welfare Institute yesterday afternoon. The audience of more than 2,000 people was unprecedented. After the rain, this result is even more commendable. Unfortunately, the field was slippery, like running on ice. Hualian finally relied on Li Yichen's nine-yard kick to defeat Portugal and determine the victory. The episode of Rui Tang vs. Le You's performance took place first. Referee Fang Rongfu, Le You relied on Guan Shuyi's wonderful shot to hit the target, and Zhang Mingniu of the other side missed the nine-yard penalty kick, taking the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half. After changing sides, Zhang Mingniu of Rui Tang equalized first, and Zhang Banglun, assisted by Ye Yiting, scored later. At this time, the sky performed another prank, and a drizzle suddenly fell. Because both sides were performing, and the main battle was urgently waiting to begin, the game was ended early regardless of the outcome. Then Hualian and Portugal fought, and heavy rain poured down. The field was full of water, and it was extremely slippery. Both sides agreed to fight in the water, and referee Shen Huichun blew the whistle to start the game. The audience stood still in the heavy rain, motionless, and their enthusiasm for watching the game can be imagined. Because the players were wearing rubber-soled shoes, the control was lost completely, and they slipped and fell, one after another. Everyone was covered in mud, which caused laughter from all around. Although both sides had dangerous situations, they did not gain anything. The first half ended with a score of 0-0. When the second half started, Zhao Yongfang of Hualian replaced Zhou Qilin, and the offensive became more intense. Under the strenuous defense of the Portuguese team, Oliveira suddenly committed a foul in the penalty area and was penalized with a nine-yard penalty kick, which was taken by Li Yichen of Hualian. The kick went in, determining the victory. The Portuguese team's counterattack was ineffective, and Hualian defeated Portugal with a score of 1-0 and won the Weldon Shield. After the game, Qian Wiele, the factory director of Xinyuan Tobacco Factory, awarded the prize and presented the shield to Li Yichen, the captain of the Hualian team, who accepted it and dispersed.</p>
