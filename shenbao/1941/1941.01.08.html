<h3>羅斯福總統闡明國策　維護民治抨擊獨裁　認國內安全與國外局勢相關聯　決傾全力援助被侵略國家抗戰　要求國會授予新權力得執行力俾得執行任務</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統向國會與國人陳述對外事件、其言至為明白、前所罕有、議員與聽眾鼓掌之聲頻作、國會無一虛位、外交官之旁聽者有英國之代辦及南美各國與中國·挪威·阿眞廷·波斯·瑞士·芬蘭·葡萄牙等駐美之大使與公使、惟未見德義代表參加、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨對幾無隙地之第七十七屆國會、致其自一九一七年威爾遜總統宣戰以來極為衆所重視之言論、首述一七八九年以還之美國歷史、繼謂吾人須知一九一八年之和平固不公允、而慕尼黑會議以前所發動之綏靖和平、今日在獨裁制「新秩序」下推行蔓延於各國者尤不公允、美國人民今已無可規避的與此「新秩序」相　矣、猶享和平之國內、有人焉秘密散佈毒性宣傳以摧毀其團結而聳恿其擾亂、故此時世界各處之民治生恍\绞健⑾ぶ苯釉獯嗣孛苄麄魑淞χ簟⒃谶^去十六個月內、此種攻擊已使許多大小獨立國之整個生活不復存在、而施政者猶進行不已、其他國家無論大小悉受威脅、余為一國部統、在履行余之憲法上職務以本國狀態報告國會時、余覺有不可不為國會告者、我國之將來安全二與吾人之民治主義、其繫於我國邊界以外之事件至為深切、四大陸現方整飭軍備、以防護民治主義之生存、苟此防禦僅歸失敗、則歐亞非澳四大陸之整個人民與資源、悉為戰勝者所支配矣、</p>
<p>厭棄綏靖主義</p>
<p>人苟侈談個未有準備之美國、在一隻手被縛於背後時、能雙手捍衛全世界、此言固屬時機未熟、且亦不確、余將警告國人曰、凡務現實之美人、決不能從獨裁者之和平中、斯望國際慷慨或眞正獨立之恢復．或世界軍縮·或任何良好事業、吾人對於巧言如簧宣傳綏靖主義者必須始終壓棄之、而對於一小部分自私人物、欲剪美國腐翼以飾其自己巢穴者、吾人尤必須謹防之、今當有人謂美國可免於來自海外之直接攻擊、誠然、苟英國海軍一日存在、則美國一日無此危險、即使未有英國海軍、任何敵國亦不致在未有軍事發動之根據地以前而作遠隔數千哩大洋派兵在美登陸、以攻美國之愚昧舉動、惟是侵略國旣維持其攻勢、則選擇其進攻之時間地方與方法者、厥為侵略國而非吾人、此即美洲各民國前途今日在嚴重危險中之理由、亦即吾國政府人員與國會議員全體負有重大之責任原因、</p>
<p>國策包含三點</p>
<p>美國應付國外事件之國策所根據者、為對於大小國家權利與尊嚴之尊重、與道德的公道終必獲勝之信仰一種政策可歸納於三點、第一依不拘黨派的民衆志願之明白表示、美國必進行包括一切之國防、第二、美國對於各處意志堅決之人民、因其抗戰而使戰禍不延及此半球者、必予以完全援助、第三、道德之原則與自身安全之考慮、決不許美國默許侵略者所指使與綏靖派所發動之和平、此種前提、美國必遵守之云、</p>
<p>加速戰具生產</p>
<p>總統繼言軍械出產方面現所有之進行、尙未可認為滿意、因軍艦建造雖超過預定程序、然飛機出產則後於預定程序也、總統謂余將請國會大增新經費、並授余新權力以進行業已開始之工作、並趕速製造各種軍用品、俾交與現與侵略國作戰之國家、吾人最有益之任務奮勉工作、如一兵工廠然、不獨為自己服務、且為與侵略國抗戰之國家服務、各抗戰國不需人力、但需價值億兆元之防禦戰具而已、彼等未能現款價值之時今不在遠、吾人不能亦不願因彼等目前未有償付吾人知其所必需的利器之能力而遂令其投降、余故不主張貸以美元以償貨款、將來用美元歸楚、余主張使此種國家繼續在美獲有戰器、以其定單適配於吾人自己程序之中、彼等所定戰具、如將來需要幾皆可有益於吾國防務、凡吾人所運往海外者、在戰後相當時期內、彼等以同樣物品或依吾人選擇以彼等所出產而為吾人所需要之其他物品歸還之、</p>
<p>不為威脅所動</p>
<p>吾人其向各民治國告曰、「我美人對於君等之防護自由、有生死所繫之關切、吾人現傾注吾人之能力資源與組織力、予君等以恢復並維持自由世界之力量、吾人將以日見增多之船隻·飛機一坦克車·興大砲供給君等、此為吾人之旨趣與吾人之担任」、吾人於實踐此種旨趣時、不為獨裁者所發之威嚇所動、獨裁者因吾人援助膽敢抵抗其侵略之民治國、揚言將視吾人之援助為破壞國際公法與作戰行為、其實此種援助、獨裁家縱欲片面指為戰爭行為、然究非戰爭行為、獨裁者如準備對吾人作戰、固不待吾人有戰爭行為、彼等何嘗待挪威比利時或荷蘭有戰爭行為而始加兵哉、彼等唯一注意者為一種新而片面的、在遵守上缺少相互性、而在實施上徒為壓迫工具之國際公法耳云、</p>
<p>犧牲爭取自由</p>
<p>總統繼稱、人人必須準備作緊急時局所需要之犧牲、余將在預算案咨文中、主張國防程序之經費、其取諸捐稅之部份宜親目前為大、任何人不許因此程序而致富、對於將來吾人屬望於人類四大自五、即言論自由·信仰自由·說離缺乏之自由·與說離惶恐之自由是、我國巳將其命運置諸憶兆自由男女之手中·腦中·心中·及其在上蒼指導下對於自由之信仰中、自由者何、即人類權利之至尊無上也、無諭何處凡奮鬬以爭此權利或維護此權利者、吾人輙予以援助、吾人力量即吾人旨趣之統一、此種高尙觀念、除勝利外無有止境云、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　財長摩根韜昨吿記者稱、中國平凖基金即可簽字、渠稱、該協定之細則、規定以五千萬美元貸予中國、以平凖中國法幣、此項協定大約在本週內即可完成云（七日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間致界人士今日談稱、重慶政府有再得美國借款之望、據稱、美財長摩根韜昨日曾向新聞記者發表談話、彼將於本週內與中國金融代表宋子文繼續進行談話云、（七日海通社電）</p>
<h3>聆美總統言論　中國大為興奮　柏林官方暫持緘默　羅馬方面表示惱怒</h3>
<p>重慶　今日消息羅斯福總統昨日對國會之演說、已使重慶官方大為興奮、雖政府方面未發表正式評論、而非官方則表示完全贊同、此間人士認羅斯福總統所宣布國策上三大要點、不特為减輕世界危難最實際之方法、且為援助正在抵抗侵略各國之最有效之手段、羅總統認歐洲與亞洲戰爭同樣重要一節、中國人士尤為嘉許、認羅總統此語、係表明美國已決意對爭求生存與全能國作殊死戰之國家、將不分彼此、一律予以充分援助、此間權威人士謂應使反侵略之民主國家成為大武庫而增加其抵抗力云、（七日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　羅斯福總統在國會之演說、此間最高方面昨日認為係對德義日侵略之挑戰云、（七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　昨日華盛頓外交界預料、若德人於明春企圖侵犯英倫三島、則羅總統終將有下令美海陸方面之空軍人員與英軍駢肩作戰之可能、美軍事專家僉認、德國將俟其空軍完全戰勝英空軍後、方敢作此種侵略、外交方面稱、由羅總統之咨文而推測未來、茍英國迫於環境、則美國亦可不正式宣職、而對德作軍事行動、又據一般人指稱、羅總統常提及渠先輩於一九四一年前、「為欲維護美國之權益與和平商業之原則、屢在西印度·地中海·及太平洋、作不宣而戰之戰爭」、同時據非正式投票結果、美國會已凖備將業已大量增加之國防與無限制援英新程序加以通過云、（七日國際社電）</p>
<p>柏林　權威界昨日宣稱、羅斯福總統向國會提出之年報、其中一部份之措辭「頗為犀利」、惟彼等在未接得全文之前、拒絕發表任何意見、（七日合眾社電</p>
<p>羅馬　此間政界人士對羅斯福總統向國會提出之週年咨文所產生之第一印象、厥為美國不啻驅使軸心國對美宣戰、衆認咨文之一般內容、不外在譴責軸心國之主義·理想·及目標云（七日合眾社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　羅斯福總統致國會之演辭、已激怒義人、今晨「義大利人民報」著論、指美總統以偏見及理論的敵意對付全能各國、或有以美國何以不向軸心國宣戰為問者、須知美總統的曖昧及偽善的策略、其目的係欲使平日反對干預之美國人民趨於妥協、例如美總統之偽善計謀、將使軸心國對美船運材料至英所給予之最後合法制裁、被視為無理之侵略、此種計謀殊不能欺騙任何人士云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　內閣情報局副發言人今日招待外國訪員時、有問以對羅斯福總統之爐邊談話作何感想者、石井答稱、其中並無新頴之言論、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>羅京　外交官吏昨日稱、羅斯福之國會咨文、與宣戰至為接近、故此後美國應被視為參戰份子云、彼等認此項宣言至合時宜、因現時歐戰正漸有向束南歐發展之趨勢、此項趨勢對一般小國之政策甚有影譽、因彼等大有被逼「作重要決定」之可能也、（七日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>義大利內閣　發表宣言　信守軸心盟約　決心奮戰到底</h3>
<p>倫敦　據羅馬電訊、今日義內閣發表宣言、重申義大利之忠於德義同盟及三國公約、內閣主席曾宣稱、義大利決心奮戰到底、並對於義國人民之能力表示信任、上述之宣言適與義總司令部之承認巴迪亞陷落、同時發表、又據羅馬另一消息、謂來年之義大利預算將為五萬萬鎊、戰費尙不包括在內、義國去年收支不數之數、約為三五〇·〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　本薛凡尼亞共和黨衆議員李滋氏、昨在眾院建議、令羅斯福總統在日軍佔據中國項土期間、廢止美日間之商業關係、喬治亞民主黨眾議員派治則建議法案一則、自一九四一年十二月三十一日起、不准一切外人移居美國、並將美國一切之外僑、加以驅逐云、（七日合衆電）</p>
<h3>日蘇貿易談判　宣告停頓</h3>
<p>東京　因外務省發言人今晨承認蘇日雙方在莫斯科進行之貿易談話、巳暫時停頓、而訂臨時漁約之談判、亦於十二月卅一日舊約期滿時臨時發生障碍、惟日本並不亟於進行漁約談利、蓋二前約亦係期滿後歷時願久始行簽訂也、（七日路透）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英義對抗一初期的檢討</h3>
<p>北非洲義屬利比亞的巴迪亞，是義國海軍良港，陸上堡壘，亦是空軍根據地，墨索里尼一再稱述它的固若金湯。現在經過了十九天的惡戰，被英軍攻下了。這是近幾個月來，德義在非洲近東及中東陸上。企圖瓦解英帝國；以及英國竭力堵截德義前進，以反攻的恣態來打擊義大利；雙方在這兩種對立的意念之下，所作最劇烈的戰鬥。從本月四號英軍開入巴迪亞起，事實已經說明英軍在這對抗的初步階段中，獲得了勝利；而義大利方面的戰鬥力，相形之下，甚為薄弱，其當前處境，復極艱危，也就相當暴露了。</p>
<p>北非洲的初期對抗，始於去年夏天義軍攻佔英屬索瑪里蘭。當時義軍前進的口號，是立刻攻下英屬亞丁港及完全控制紅海的東端。可是，紅海西岸的義大利海軍根據地亞沙布港，及由法國手裏奪過來的吉布的港，距離對岸的亞丁之間，隔着僅僅十五英里寬的海面，卒因英國艦隊的堵截，使義軍竟不獲打成一片。這一方面的戰事，因此而暫呈僵局。於是義大利就移轉了目標，向英屬坎尼亞發展，也曾經獲得相當的進境；且有一度，在大規模的轟炸掩護下，義軍一直前進到木雅魯與本那以及外吉爾等地；但一面由於交通的困難，飲料的缺乏，同時也由於英軍及土著隊伍採取大規模遊擊戰術，困擾義軍，使義軍遭到了頓挫。義大利在這期間所獲得的，祗是一些不毛的沙漠地帶，軍略上絲毫沒有意義。此外，義軍亦曾在阿比西尼亞境內的亞斯馬拉，剛達，及亞的斯亞巴巴等三地，分頭集中．企圖對英埃蘇丹大舉進襲，但始終未聞有何動作。故到現在巴迪亞陷落為止，關於英義間東非的對抗，可算暫告一個段落。</p>
<p>去年十月間，義軍在巴爾幹發動進攻希臘。可是在希臘堅强抵抗及英國海空軍盡力支持下，黑衫勇士們再三敗挫；不獨牠佔取希臘的各府，薩羅尼加等軍港的企圖沒有達到，連他自己在亞爾巴尼亞最大的海軍良港杜拉蘇。目前也在英希聯軍威脅之下了。杜拉蘇萬一竟然不守，則義大利所恃以扼守亞德里亞海的門戶，便磕破了一扇大門；而英國海軍將不難深入亞德里亞海，直攻威尼斯。當所以現在兩方都在出全力爭取亞爾巴桑一帶戰爭的勝利。在這一期間，義國海軍也遭到了嚴重的敗績，吐蘭多一役，義國艦隊幾乎被毀半數。這對於後來義國的增援亞爾巴尼亞前綫，增加了無限的困難與威脅。</p>
<p>最近義軍失陷巴迪亞，可謂最近的最大敗績；從此喪失其進攻埃及的主要根據地，粉碎了進攻英屬亞歷山大軍港的計劃，更無望於進佔賽德港而控制蘇伊士運河。在這次巴迪亞之役，據英國方面宣稱，前後俘獲義軍共達六萬人之多，姑不問為數是否的確，其為鉅數無疑；這在軍事損失以外，且便墨索里尼的建立非洲帝國計劃，受了近乎致命的重大打擊。若想大規模增援，再取攻勢，反敗為勝，至少在最近將來是不可能了。義國方面宣稱，英國這次所用力量，陸軍達四十五萬人，空軍機數達一千架；我們對此，亦不必問為數是否的確，然儘夠窺知這次戰役規模如何宏大，意義如何重要。</p>
<p>推其影響所及：第一，阻止了戰局的擴大，使附近的一些國家，暫時不致被捲入漩渦。假如，義大利眞能克服亞丁附近的英國艦隊，佔據亞丁。或者攻下埃及，佔領蘇伊士運河區，則英國在近東中東及非洲一帶的軍事佈置，就會立刻發動，所有葉門，漢志，伊拉克，埃及等國，就會立刻捲了進去；不但如此，整個巴爾幹的形勢，亦將變化，而成為德義囊中之物；一面西班牙，一面土耳其各有參戰的可能。現在則暫時相安，實綠義軍挫敗。第二，關於民心士氣，英國自歐陸大戰敗退以來，這幾個月。一再對義獲勝，總可以大大恢復了勝利的信念；而在義大利方面，自墨索里尼當國以來，其海陸空三軍在這第一次試驗中，便遭到這樣的挫頓打擊，當然不能謂這與法西斯黨以及義大利的威信無關。第三，戰局前途雖時常有轉變的可能，若照最近這樣趨嚮與速度而發展，則義大利究將怎樣與德國駢肩作戰到底，很快的成為問題了；而德國的不得不遣重兵，進駐義境，是其側面的說明。</p>

<h3>英軍先頭部隊　進抵杜白魯克外圍　與黑衫守軍發生接觸　巴迪亞殘敵完全肅清</h3>
<p>倫敦　聞英軍先頭部隊已進抵杜白魯克區、英空軍已開始猛擊該地固防之義軍海空軍根據地、以為英軍進攻之準備、昨夜英矗炸機開始轟炸引起大火、五十五哩外之巴迪亞猶能見之、距離該．地數百哩之特里波里亦遭轟炸（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間負責方面宣布英軍機械化部隊、現巳接觸杜白魯克之外國防綫、英軍於攻下巴迪亞後、即迅速向前推進、不予敵軍以喘息之機會、據倫敦可恃方面所接消息、英軍目前所獲之勝利情形如下、自去年十二月九日以來英方共俘獲敵兵七萬人、並使義軍九萬四千人失去戰鬥力量、英軍在各次戰事中、俘獲及擊潰之義軍共計正規軍三師·黑衫軍兩師．機械化部隊一師·及輜重隊一團、至於英軍所獲得之大批軍用材料、目前尙未能詳細開列、估計自巴迪亞陷落以後、格萊齊亞尼上將所部軍隊已喪失其大砲卡車及軍火之半數、兵士之損失固無論矣、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社特派員從西部沙漠英軍司令部來電稱、義軍前綫今在杜白魯克、該地在里比亞邊界內約一百哩、乃格拉齊亞尼上將所率海空軍大根據地、英軍現已肅清巴迪亞殘敵、而巴迪亞與杜白魯克之間確無義軍踪跡、英軍則往來巡邏、查巴迪亞防綫僅一道、杜自魯克則有兩道防綫、外綫周圍約二十五哩、內綫約十一哩、不論里比亞戰事之將來趨勢如何、格拉齊亞尼必巳處於甚嚴重之地位、除大批義軍被俘外、且已喪失里比亞義軍所有大砲卡車軍火等戰具之半數、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴迪亞英軍行　營性急之英坦克車駕駛員、昨日紛紛駕隆作聲之戰車而離巴迪亞、西向里比亞大港杜白魯克再取閃電攻勢、各駕駛員並大呼「到杜自魯克去」、杜白魯克己遭英空軍轟炸二十四小時、火光燭天、雖在六十哩外之巴迪亞城中亦可望見之、澳洲步軍及英國其他皇家步軍、現正忙於肅清巴迪亞戰塲、該地義軍被俘者、據先前估計約為三萬、衆信「檢點」完畢後、此數或將增至四萬、英軍巳在巴迪亞行政官署中設立戰地司令部、該司令部中有一種意見、以為大批德機或將急飛杜白魯克協助該地防務、但英軍已下決心、乘德空軍未到前、先佔領之、據昨夜未官方息、英軍先鋒一隊早已開抵杜白魯克西南二十哩之處、聞格拉齊亞尼將軍之軍隊已集中杜白魯克、（七日國際電）</p>
<p>義承認巴迪亞陷落</p>
<p>羅馬　義總司令部公報承認巴迪亞之最後據點、已於一月五日傍晚陷落、該公報續稱、義軍死傷及失踪甚為重大、英機轟炸杜白魯克時、義方高射砲隊會擊落其中之兩架、阿爾巴尼亞方面、義軍已克復重要陣地一處、獲得武器子彈、該公報又提及蘇丹邊境之特希尼區城內、會有英方機械化部隊被義軍砲火擊散、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英軍某高級軍官述攻陷巴迪亞戰事、其結論謂若非格拉齋亞尼上將才疏識淺、統率無方、即係格氏被法西斯黨所驅、出此不智行動、義軍一味盲進而不謀白身安全、以防敗北、、實不智已極、惟格氏似被迫出此違反其較佳的判斷之不智行動、義方情報科亦已失敗、蓋其所知作戰英軍人數恒有錯誤、時或估計過多、時或完全不知英軍開到云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>黑衫軍隊士氣頹喪</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社軍事評論家稱、巴迪亞之陷落、固意料中事、惟英軍勝利之偉大及其迅速、俘虜義軍之衆與英軍傷亡之微、則非始料所及、義國對里比亞之控制、現已根本搖動、其對阿比西尼亞之持制亦然、義軍所表現之作戰素質甚劣、足證義兵皆無心於戰爭、義兵投降者旣如此之多、令人不能不信缺乏鬥志、非僅局部現象而必係駐里比亞全體義軍或義國全部陸軍皆乏戰鬥精神、中東英軍總司令華維爾將軍立即率歸直指杜白魯克、除給養外、已無其他阻得且給養現巴大增、英軍進攻杜白魯克諾、非抵該港不致遇何抵抗、巴迪亞旣已不守、則杜自魯克義軍將否頑强抗拒、未可斷言、就事實言、里比亞義軍是否力能續加堅强抵禦、事頗可疑、故若見杜白魯克在一週內陷落、不足異也、</p>
<p>德軍赴援為時已晚</p>
<p>倫敦　傳聞德機五百架與德兵一萬名集於義國南部各港、準備開至里比亞增援、此說縱屬事實亦已過遲、大可以虛聲恫嚇視之、蓋德機若抵里比亞將見其飛機塲已被炸壞、遂有迭遭攻擊之虞、而德方若圖從海上運兵萬名往里比亞、皆將葬身魚腹也、今英方戰略或將完全逐義軍出里比亞、然後轉取其他任何目標、里比亞義軍總司令格拉齋亞尼上將除須抗禦英軍之挺進外、尙須派若干軍隊保護殖居北部沿海之義國農民、蓋部落民族受義人虐待而被逐出其舊居者、將奮起襲擊無保護之義人家宅也、里比亞沿海各港口與飛機塲之地位、對於英海空軍極為重要、故英軍當以估據此等港口與飛機塲為先務、庶能重獲地中海之控制權、而從東方運來之供應品亦能暢通、同時英軍在里比亞沿海得立足地、卽能賡續進攻義國云、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（廿九）</p>
<h3>英軍官西綫日記</h3>
<p>這是英國軍官格列勃爾上尉在西綫作戰的日記，原文載美國「星期六晚報」，茲譯錄於後：</p>
<p>一九四〇年五月十日：四三十分左右，被高射砲驚醒。起初並不注意。待至五時一刻，覺砲火異常猛烈，隆隆之聲，不絕于耳，且聞飛機軋軋作聲，盤旋於頂上，乃起床趨至窗前探望。其時曙光甫露，天際無雲。見有敵機五架，排成令鋼鑽隊形，高射砲彈在其四周爆裂，硝烟蔽空。俄而聯軍戰鬥機飛至，機槍略咯，雜然並作，餘機亦相繼而來。迨至各機飛出視綫之外，砲聲亦即沉寂。</p>
<p>返床再寢，睡至七點鐘，格利遜敲擊隔空奧斯鮑羅之門，方再驚醒。奧斯鮑羅旋即入我室，據他報告，方知大戰巳開始。</p>
<p>我們的營舍係單獨租賃的一所小宅，相當舒適。奧斯鮑羅首先沐浴，忽忽吃過早餐，便駕着汽車駛往司令部。我却不慌不忙地起了床，吃了早飯，整理公文，一小時後方到辦公處，證實德軍巳開到盎黑。英法聯軍也已開入比利時。我軍飛機塲多被轟炸，可是損失頗微。德軍轟炸機被擊落五架，我軍也有五架在地面被毀，但無傷亡。飛機未起飛即被炸毀，很可痛心。馬萊伊空軍分隊司令部交通綫會被賠中破壞，歷時一二小時始克修復。</p>
<p>鎭上市面興旺，花肆中姹紫嫣紅，爭妍鬥艷。送乳酪的老婦，依然準時到來，並無一言談及早上的事。</p>
<p>九時半接到消息，格來文麥休和萊密希已有敵方傘兵降落。</p>
<p>盧森堡至愛希脫那哈路上，軍隊進行，長達十英里。到處都看見人面露笑容。</p>
<p>十時，我到車站找尋一箱亞蒙酒，沒有找到。我又設法安置了吳道爾上校的車夫何根和馬弁斯被爾。十時三十分回到司令部，知道大戰巳經展開。</p>
<p>空軍分隊聯絡員郎司頓剛正回來。</p>
<p>途中，他遇到德國轟炸機兩架，在頭上盤旋，高僅四十英尺。其中一架，被高射砲擊落，駕駛員均被俘獲。</p>
<p>據報，比利時荷蘭軍隊已奮起抵抗，法軍亦巳開過比利時邊境。</p>
<p>十時三十五分，空軍司令巴拉特口啣烟斗，笑容可掬，偕同參謀人員來到。</p>
<p>空軍分隊雖已于今晨派機出發偵察，但直到此時，尙無消息報告。</p>
<p>此時忽接報告，敵方運兵飛機四十架巳在海牙降落</p>
<p>總司令部似乎毫無戒備。在假官兵很是不少。情報絡繹而來，幾無一秒鐘的空閒。現在事實來了。關於我們的軍隊或飛機，却是亳無消息，沒有電報，沒有情報，也沒有電話。</p>
<p>空襲警報機裝在郵政局屋頂上，幾乎正對我們的營舍。警報的怪聲，使人聞之心悸。我個人覺得當地人心浮動，由于空襲警報的心理作用者較多，由于實際上的轟炸者反小。今晨透格湼鐵路附近公路，平民死傷頗多，確是一件慘事。</p>
<p>五月十二日晚九時：今日並未可記。其實到現在還是一字未記。昨夜值班，所以今天沒有精神寫日記了。</p>
<p>消息傅來，調我方空軍挺進隊全隊駕駛員都願作敢死隊，入選四人，而未及破壞的麥斯特列脫鎭各橋全行炸毀。但是他們壯志雖巳完成，恐已全體殉難了。他們使聯軍批有寶貴時間，得在比京不魯塞爾以東第耳河預定陣綫，從容據守</p>
<p>自瑞士邊境以迄北海，戰事已在大規模的展開，敵軍聲東擊西，虛實難辨。荷蘭形勢尤極倘恍迷離，使人莫測。自相矛盾的消息，不絕而來。一般印象，都以為德軍未能如他們的預期，把聯軍陣綫一舉擊破。麥斯特列脫一點，雖被敵軍衝破，但已是早在預料中的</p>
<p>英國飛機駕駛員某，今晨在唐格勒和透萊蒙之間被敵擊落。他逃了一會，與比利時步兵數名相過。他們把一隊德國坦克車誤認為比軍坦克車隊，迎上前去，被一陣槍彈射回。</p>
<p>他們全部逃入一座森林。在林中發現幾具平民屍體。那駕駛員把一具屍體的衣服脫下，脫掉制服，喬裝比利時農民，混過德軍陣綫。半小時後，他搭着一輛比利時車子，覓路來到這一裏司令部。現在他正赴空軍第五分隊歸隊去了。今晚不再寫了，我必得安睡一會。</p>
<p>五月十三日：今晨戰局似頗穩定，但正在逐漸開展祇有法國第七軍的左翼受着德軍機械化部隊的威脅。敵軍機械化部隊正密集通過布來達，綿延十二英里之長。轟炸機司令部看到這是個良好目標，很想一顯身手。我希望法軍所要求的援兵不久便可見效。</p>
<p>四日以來，德軍對於開入比利時的英法軍隊，絕未加以轟炸，殊令人有奇異之感。我們的進兵，在德軍似乎是求之不得。法軍總司令部難道不知遭遇戰的危險，應當竭力避免的嗎？</p>
<p>五月十四日：色當陷落的嚴重消息傳來了，色當位于末斯河畔。狄南渡口，約在那摩爾之南十五英里，巳被佔據。我方值夜班，午夜忽接色當形勢惡化的消息，該處敵軍已佔有長十五公里深十公里的凸角。高級軍官舉行緊急會議，出席的，英國方面有空軍司令巴拉特，法國方面有達士梯將軍，耶弗利埃將軍，軍團司令畢洛脫將軍，陸軍參謀長並治將軍的聯絡員達爾諾，空軍參謀長費育明將軍的聯絡員貝桑狄唐。會議情形悽慘動人。多數法國軍官，莫不心酸淚落，又因法軍不加抵抗，即行退出鞏固陣地，愧赧無似，甚至有失聲痛哭的。這種事情，實在太不堪設想了！</p>
<p>據達爾諾告訴我說，法軍在色當方面巳有戰門機三十架。重砲隊正以全力猛轟敵軍。步兵定于十一時由坦克車前導，實行反攻。法軍士氣旺盛，希望能把德軍一鼓擊退。</p>
<p>下午二時十五分：法軍在色當方面的反攻巴延遲了三十分鐘。這是致命的停頓。同時德軍再接再厲，已把突破的缺口，向左右兩翼各伸展了三英里，向前又深入了三英里，達到曠野之地。法軍砲隊已全部損失了。（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食　雖有大宗洋米到滬　不能動搖米商毫末　蓄意不肯將囤貨出售　立意不願多定期洋米　用意豈在餓死上海人</h3>
<p>昨日米市、續呈擯持狀態、迺以洋米受限各貨、一再暴漲、超越邊錢、在當局嚴密監視之下、旣乏上升之可能、而囤積者奢望彌堅、不肯就此脫手、大有寗可將囤米擱置霉爛</p>
<p>紅朽、不願遵限放鬆、為益民食、似此虎狼存心、貪得無饜、蓋亦有鑒於當局對於囤戶、尙無執法相繩、米市塲迄未作有系統有方針之整頓、因之兇燄愈張、不肯將手貨出售、市上遂至無貨應市、欲購者無從購得、並鑒於臬行越限交易、判處徒到、亦稍知儆戒、不欲輕率舉動、旣見米行囤家均不願照限出賣、自亦不欲逾限買進、自貽伊戚、寗願坐守、好在各米店均有存積、不患無貨應市、遂使市塲之上、交易寥落、形同死市、所開現貨、祇七十九元之海防紅米、及七十八元次至七十六元三角之米菉、與夫尖碎、開七十六元次至米栖六十八元、其他一二號西貢火絞小絞等貨、市上悉無出樣、暗中恐仍在做其違法買賣、惟期路各貨一致下跌、蓋因定價合劃、進口商在市兜售甚力、一月份小絞前開過八十六元者、昨祇以八十四元兜售尚無受主、而一號西貢一月份前開九十六元者、昨由長義（另稿為合義洋行）拋出兩批、初為九十五元、下午已小至九十四元、成交祇數百噸、蓋恐多定有妨其囤積居奇也、價比之前市均小二元之鉅、回籠原包有獲利浮戶競相求出、市亦步小數角及一二元不一、十二月九日小絞祇九十三一元二角、一月十六裝初為八十四元半、繼自八十四元三角至八十四元、而進戶仍不見食、成交祇四百多噸、足見洋米定貨甚多、而米商不願定、尤見其蓄意操縱、危害民食、無可掩飾矣、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨雖續而不多、但以洋米回軟、銷塲轉遜、且貨主售意來較鬆、故形成無榮辱之局面、若崑山斛見白粳仍開一百零六元左右、青角斛見薄稻一百零一元至一百元、</p>
<p>糯米市稱在疲軟之中、且去路更覺衰弱、所以賣方雖再自願貶價求脫、但終難邀出大胃、結果售價落短一元、而成交數全市仍多不過三四白包、計宜澳白元開九十一元、香港白元八十二元、次至黃色七十八元出零而已、</p>
<p>洋米來滬甚為湧旺、昨日怡和洋行裕生輪到埠、由香港裝來一萬八千三百七十七包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、又決華郵船公司芝瑪奈克號由香港裝來一千七百噸、（包數不詳）業於本月二日清晨抵滬停靠沛東藍烟囱碼頭起卸、此輸運來之洋米、前昨所漏報、華綸洋行經理之法輸Albert　Sarrant號、由西貢直接裝來苞米二千四百五十噸、等巳誌前報、茲悉該輪巳於昨日下午四時四十五分進口、約七時可抵預定之虹口順泰停靠、今日開始起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>定到不絕　洋粉不支而跌</h3>
<p>麵粉昨洋粉已呈不支狀態、查來源方面、除香港新到一批外、聞年內尙有澳粉一船裝到、及新訂大批坎粉成交、堪稱定到不絕、故人心漸形軟化、一般囤戶均思脫手、而本街實銷、旣有平賣粉供應、其需要當然减退、客銷亦觀望待機、統市售開花烏鐘樓牌澳粉八千餘包、初開二十四元三角半、步鬆至二十四元〇五分、午後業已進關、比上日回小半．元左右、美麗牌二十四元二角、野猪牌二十四元三角半、尙無正式受主、</p>
<p>又麵粉進出口均有、前日太古江蘇輪由香港裝來九千包、巳誌昨報、茲悉昨日怡和裕生輪到埠、除中香港裝來大批洋米外、另亦有洋麵粉五千包、出口今日江蘇輪裝二千包、運往厦門、太古經埋之法倫Tranninh號、裝三千包、今日出口、運往海防、（年）</p>
<p>小麥昨市堅穩如常、因來源依然寥落、執貨者關住不出、惟粉市已見鬆軟、各廠亦不願一再放價收買、故市面尤居擯持狀熊中、</p>
<h3>金融　廣幫購進　外匯一初鬆後急轉</h3>

<p>華商晨市塞出</p>
<p>晨初倫敦大條近期均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬等均平、美對英不動、對滬大一分、對法均無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士五三一二五、美匯五元五六二五、與上日晚收價同、開後華商投機家即來市塞出、價巳告鬆、計外行及華行吸入本月份美匯為五元五九三七五、匯豐掛牌勿動、白銀平衡稅亦平、此後英行麥加利對現貨美匯略具吃胃、計華行售予價為五元五九三七五、嗣以日行亦有進意、故潛勢穩定、日銀行外行現美匯仍為五元五九三七五、午收則告回平、計現貨英金三辦士五三一二五、美匯五元五六二五、</p>
<p>港方忽來結進</p>

<h3>謠風利多　金市跌後　反動劇漲</h3>
<p>由六二八〇元之最低價　回上至六四四三元收盤</p>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、先跌後突反動劇漲、價曾四次破入六千三百元內、旋即回出、後又飛出六千四百元關、實因外匯經外商各行吸納、難鬆易緊、更謠香港有某種會議等無稽傳說、各方人心因之由疲轉堅、放價上午在現金號小錢莊賣勢下、會退至六千二百八十元、下午經銀號證券兩幫之猛進、散空傾軋、價飛上至六千四百四十三元高價收、反跌竟軋升一百〇五元、照一月期美匯五元半結價、為六千三百五十二元、計抬九十一元、全日交易在一萬兩以上、現金上午由金號售小至六百四十元、後步升至六百六十元、軋升十元、關金等均</p>

<p>飾金先小而後大</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行與新同行初掛六百五十元、十一點小十元、計六百四十元、至下午三點即回升十元、四點又升十元、達六百六十元、軋升十元、收進减卅元云、</p>
<h3>美票重出十八元關</h3>

<h3>紗花　同業不看小　棉紗跌風已定</h3>
<p>上日狂落之紗市、昨日上午開市、復入盤旋之途、但實際消費、因臘尾關係、各幫採辦殊滯、同時外匯寗靜、而見放長、金子幫傾向拋出、市象帶疲、惟同業有一部份不看小、所以市態遂呈趦　之狀二十支雙馬高價為一千三百四十五元、低價一千三百三十四元、但收盤後、做至一千三百四十八元、午後暗盤因外匯轉緊、金價直上、始做一千三百五十元、繼為一千三百五十五元、今日有棉紗十五件運厦門、九百十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後、黃金漲後又縮、市塲人心平凡、一般搶精子之輩、大都向拋空方面着想、首盤價五千三百四十一元、此盤一開、買者頗不乏人、回升至一千三百四十六元、在一千三百四十元外　旋時甚久、旋聞外匯安定、黃金稍疲、人心軟化、及實需冷淡、賣者及浮多吐出、逐步跌至一千三百三十四元、迨至十一時後、空頭扒補、又復昂至一千三百四十二元、查半日間成交統計六千一百七十包、行情二十支雙馬平平、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>雙馬紗　曷為而倐漲倐落</h3>
<p>最近之紗市、發現新高峯後、而又迅速回下、茲將其經過情形、作簡述報告於後、</p>
<p>（一）外客方面、在上年十二月初、突來拖進、看外匯要縮、此後果然實現、黃金飛漲、因之雙馬隨之上升、至十二月二十七日頂高價會見一千四百三十五元、比月初低、至一千二百〇七元、飛漲二百廿八元、但市塲上大都目標轉移而看昂、豈料獲利者乘機出籠、所以新年一過、本埠外匯反見寗靜而放長、於此一般浮戶、鑒於環境不良、將多額奮起了結、榨面一鬆、反動驟起、市盤一瀉四·五十元之鉅、昨日午前最低價曾見一千三百三十四元、比高舉已跌落一百〇一元、所以午後因黃金稍昂、投機者復見活動、而轉趨上升、</p>
<p>（二）據市塲言、香港方面實際銷路殊滯、對於三二．支單紗納胃較健外、其他絕少生色、所以雙馬紗為大眾投機目的物、其餘雜牌紗相差距離太遠、二十支大女價在一千．百元內、二十支雙地球價為一千一百四十元、有此高低程度、不一情形、有一部份與其買進雙馬、不如買進低價之物、較為穩妥、</p>
<p>（三）雙馬外棧現貨、因銷塲不起、寄存棧房、要保險棧租等雜費、且投機者不歡迎、有此原因、予雙馬棧單價要廉宜幾十元、就以上之情况、泰半將雙馬放棄不做矣、所以一來反動、忽跌一百元外、</p>
<p>（四）根本問題、不能脫離實際消費也、銷路如廣、漲力當然方能鞏固、否則人力做作、甲盈利、轉售與乙、如斯輾轉數次、結果雖以美滿也、不過目前情形、專恃謠諑而作伸縮、總之此番市面、漲於事前、所以有跌於事後之現象、（珊）</p>
<h3>棉花廠需不旺</h3>
<p>現棉情况、仍乏精彩可言、此因外匯安定、　則印棉定貨絡繹而抵滬、所以人心平澹、惟同業中對於互相買賣、稍見起色、但廠方需要仍不旺、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初元因投機者之賣出而跌、續後則因國因銷耗原棉數字之增加、及華爾街股票之漲價、結果收盤價格、較之一日漲磅音、印度昨日連同預測跌落二羅比二、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續靜寂異常、各方俱無　意、日方廠商購意較濃、然亦零星父易也、同業方面仍抱觀望態度、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布後市轉堅</h3>
<p>廠布昨市趨勢平疲、收市時微告回堅、大戶吸進之額、堅持不動、而散戶廉額、略有成交、客銷亦乏躉批、售盤粗細布斜紋一部份成交價每疋跌一角至二角半、漂染布平定、後市一致轉堅、本街成交各布五百餘件、浙閩幫辦藍布、色斜·府綢等一百數十件、粵港幫辦卡其·色布·組布等一百餘件、國外星加坡小呂宋等地辦色布·漂布等貨五千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布先跌後漲、市勢轉昂、白貨龍頭細布晨盤步步下遊、最低價降至四十元〇一角、後市因取引所紗價狂升、散戶紛紛拖納、逐盤上騰、收市為四十一元四角、每疋較漲五角、其他雜牌細布亦一致帶高、四君子嗶嘰新棧單回升至一元一角九分二五、而老棧單拔開愈遠、僅一元一角三分七五、</p>
<p>疋頭出口、八日運香港一千四百二十件、運厦门三十四件、運天津四百件、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價跌風加厲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢不振、人心至軟、於是跌風轉盛、公會劃盤現貨二四組白、本棧七十九元、外棧七十八元半至七十八元、跌一元六角、荷棉白BS嘜初為七十八元二角、至七十八元、後為七十七元半、降七角、荷赤現貨六十六元六角至二角、一月十五日打單六十七元至六十六元三角、跌一元、太古車白B嘜七十八元八角至五角、後為七十八元、小一元、DY嘜七十七元五角至二角、小八角、HX嘜七十七元三角至七十六元八角、小七角、H嘜赤六十四元、老貨六十三元八角、跌度較微、本廠一號冰一百元、晶明冰一百〇一元、跌二元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜生仁俱緊</h3>
<p>金針菜昨市續緊、頂莊貨號方又開出一批、價為一百二十五元、漲起五元、餘亦隨緊、</p>
<p>生仁如威海衛因為當地統制、不發搬出證、股乏到貨、故市勢步緊、昨青島仁洋莊六十一元半、統貨五十八元、揚州仁五十三元、固鎭仁近有運到、尙米開出、約五十二元、徐州花生四十一元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市頓見繁榮</h3>
<p>本埠絲市、因受絲價突漲影響、一掃沉悶之氣、竟呈繁榮之象、前昨兩日、各出口行均有相當進胃、統計全日交易、當在二百五十包左右、</p>
<h3>雜貨　香烟行盤回小</h3>
<p>香烟市况、歲內漲勢頗烈、連日紅盤漸跌、因金融趨平、人心安定、執貨者獲利脫手、買方反而軟弱、及廠方派貨較多、致昨市開售、跌風甚熾、如老刀牌開九百廿五元、大英牌一千三百廿五元、較年因小五十餘元、小仙女六百五十八元、五華牌六百六十元、品海牌八百七十元、十支前門牌每萬枝三百廿七元、華成公司美利牌金鼠牌照行盤加十餘元、（坤）</p>
<h3>五金　鋼條鐵坏　同見高騰</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條　新歲以來、殊呈熱鬧、因江浙內河幫時有點綴、而本街建築幫亦有納胃、加以太平洋風雲趨緊、來源不多、市存欠豐、故人心昂挺、開價見秀、如三四分花色每噸須開一千三百元光景、五分至一寸粗貨每噸亦沽一千二百三四十元不等、比前均各高二三十元左右</p>
<p>黑鐵坯子　鐵坯交易前昨由本街熱水瓶廠吸進不少、而北路客商及本埠之零星買賣、亦殊不寂寞、故市况相當良佳、業中人心思依然看好、行情亦趨步高、昨二千磅原扎貨每件沽一千二百元至三百元不等、</p>

<h3>工部局加捐案　各方盼愼重討論　生計日困市民力不勝任　加捐與减政應同時並舉</h3>
<p>工部局此次擬議增加捐稅四成、藉以彌補其二千萬元之赤字財政、因此引起中外多數人之反對、在此住戶窮於應付日用必需之食糧燃料諸物外、更欲增加其房租之負担、則此後生活之困難、益感不堪設想、而二十三日之納稅人特別大會中、勢必引起劇烈之紛爭、當在逆料之中、</p>
<p>加捐所入約二千萬</p>
<p>查工部局現在稅收地租為一千四百十四萬六千五百元、房捐為二千一百二十六萬六千元、租界外之特別稅烏一百三十八萬元、今欲加四成、則地租一項、可增收五百六十五萬八千六百元、房捐一項、司增收八百五十萬六千餘元、租界外之特別稅一項、可增收五十五萬二千元、則二項並計、約有一千四百七十一萬五千元、加以各項雜捐增收之數、亦不下六百萬左右、如此增益其收入、固足以彌補二千萬元之赤字財政、</p>
<p>市民經濟難以負担</p>
<p>但不顧市民困苦、旱然出此竭澤而漁之辦法、將來租界治安、殊有感覺難以維持之苦、故一般市民意見希望納稅人特別大會中對此增加稅收問題、為顧全市民負担計、為確保社會治安計、予以愼重討論、與其增稅、不如减政、或以華人代替西人、减少匯貼、節省之　、亦不在少數、即或有增加之必要、亦必須顧及一般人之能力是否勝任、</p>
<p>會塲地點業經擇定</p>
<p>據工部局昨發公告、本月二十三日下午二時三十分舉行之納稅人特別大會、會塲地點、巴擇定靜安寺路三〇五號跑馬總會公共看臺、至大會程序規則、與上屆大會同、凡納稅人需要者、河向工部局秘書處索取、</p>

<h3>私</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>提起「私」，似乎誰都有一種「天機不可洩漏」的樣子……</p>
<p>從前，一切事情都公開不得，一「公」就有殺身之危險；因此就有：奸人私刑拷打忠良；小姐後花園私訂終身……。之類的「私把戲」發生！可是，「若要人不知，除非己莫為。」西洋鏡是終於要拆穿的，於是：奸人伏誅；小姐目縊！</p>
<p>現在，大約是時代「進步」了的緣故，像前面一類事情是不用再「私」了奸人儘可屈殺忠良，沒有人敢放半個屁；小姐儘可選擇良人祇要宣佈一聲「我愛他」，便什麼都解決了。反正不如意時也祇要請律師，上公堂，以離婚一了了之！</p>
<p>那末，難道現在就全都是公開的？不，不！所謂一自古已然「，而二於今為烈」！現在的「私」祇有凌駕從前。</p>
<p>自己棧房裏囤上幾白石米，還說米價漲得太「希奇」；兒子在外面鬼鬼祟祟幹點什麼，就是在親媽媽面前也「諱莫如深」；至於嘴裏滿口窮話，背地一裏連兩手也嫌來不及撈的一聰明人」更多似糞抗中的蠅蛆！這些都是自份之百的「私」：而且顯得「神秘」，顯得「玄妙」……。不足為外人道也</p>
<p>不過，起因相同，其後果大致也一樣的。一旦拿下面具，「私情「畢露，當然也逃不出兩條路：伏誅！自縊！</p>
<h3>聚餐會以外的</h3>
<p>— 左蕙</p>
<p>新年是怎樣慶祝的？報端滿是「恭賀新禧」，名人名言；一出門，牆頭壁角，電綫桿，信筒上貼遍了代替「對我生財」的，逐豺狼，迎勝利的紅條。</p>
<p>大公司，寶號都打了烊，什麼廠長，行長，所長都忙着赴聚餐會。計劃在先，所以元旦沒有到，房間是早就開好了的。關於房間費用，那也不用担憂，來打麻將的人多着呢，抽抽頭出來的錢，除了機面錢外，飯菜，水菓一切都可以包括在內了的。聚餐會的正式日子是元旦，費用是每人三十元，約定的是十一個人，所以共總是三百三十元，以這個數目來聚一次餐，像煞是大大有餘的，怪不得大家在背後稱他為「吝嗇鬼」的進貨部主任，伸着舌頭要問當手人了：「老吳，菜幾鈿一桌？」</p>
<p>「我想最多是用一百隻洋。」</p>
<p>「那末其餘的作什麼呢？「</p>
<p>「其餘的嗎？用塲多着呢。」</p>
<p>進貨部主任翻着眼珠的還想問下去，但是那面「「斷么九二三暗刻」「對對和」，三番呵！辣子了吧！老吳聽見這是黃先生的聲音，他利黃先生是四六合股的呀，這眞樂得他笑開了嘴巴，忙着跑過去，以致讓進貨部主任獨個子留在那兒了。</p>
<p>「虧得他還做進貨部主任呢簡直是一個阿屈死！」老吳心，里想着，「三百三十元錢，什麼經用呵！他或許以為我要揩他的油呢。」</p>
<p>進貨部主任的確登不來「大塲」，不會烟，不會骨牌，看見用錢肉麻得來要命。沒法，他只好在沙發椅上橫橫，心裏怏怏的在罵人：「聚餐，這是聚餐嗎？簡直是聚賭。」肚皮嘓嘓嘓的叫起來了，但是老吳叫着說：「等打完了四圈吃罷．」於是劈拍劈拍打下去。</p>
<p>七點半時，季主任在沙發椅上睡了一覺醒轉來，餚饌二已佈置好了，於是大家動筷。季主任可說是眞正來聚餐的，他吃得很起勁。有幾個顯然有副作用，鬼鬼祟祟地在談論些什麼，又把一樣行麼東西塞來塞去的；末了塞到進貨部主任的面前來了，他含着滿嘴的牛肉一看，原來紙上印滿着姑娘們的照相，是「羣芳」！</p>
<p>「季先生，你看那一個好？」黃先生正經地問，大家的眼光都灌注在季主任的險上。</p>
<p>「聚餐就聚餐，不要「聚姑娘」了吧！我是吃好了飯就要走的。」嘻笑着，季主任好像在諷剌着大家。</p>
<p>老吳站在電話機旁邊說：「噲那末就是三個吧？」</p>
<p>「好，三個。」</p>
<p>於是老吳撥動電話機。</p>
<p>聚餐結東了，骨牌又劈劈拍拍的響起來了，進貨部主任告辭啦，老吳送着他。季主任的一脚剛跨出了房間的門恰巧三個姑娘來了，於是退一步，讓她們先進去，然後帶着熱烘烘的臉，回味着牛肉的香味，季先生去了，房間裏揚起了男女的淫笑。</p>
<p>「每人三十元，原來還有聚餐以外的呢，」在電梯一裏，進貨部主任似乎懂得了些什麽。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>王琴到現在，隔了六七天之後，還懊悔當天不該多此一看。這並不是說這個人長得像張飛或竇二墩一樣的醜，看了便他回來做怕夢；也不是說這個人長得像周瑜或張君瑞一樣的俊，使他回來不能不想他。實際上，這個人只有一張很普通的臉，僅僅比別人特別肥大一些。玉琴對於這一張臉，倒還覺得很平常，使他最害怕的是這一張臉上的一對眸子，一對又圓，又大，又尖銳，又殘酷的眸子，裏面充分蘊藏着一種勉强抑制的獸性。</p>
<p>玉琴回頭去的時候，四道視綫恰巧碰個正着，使他慌得來不及的避開去。</p>
<p>「好！」坐在這人兩旁的那些人，－便立刻很湊趣地喊起好來，接着就聽得）陣怪梟一樣的笑聲，告訴他那胖子正在自嗚得意咧！</p>
<p>這樣一來，玉琴的唱做便大大的受了影響，他覺得那雙富於獸性的眸子始終釘住着他，沒有離開過，逼得他眞想馬上逃進後台去，立刻卸下女裝，恢復自己本來的面目。後來險些把台詞也忘記了，幸而台底下的彩聲還是像他命中注定的橫財一樣的毫無理由的湧起來，使他進了後台，不會受到他所預料着的責罵。</p>
<p>「旦角兒眞不是人唱的！」他一面搶着把頭面拉下來，一面氣憤憤地說。</p>
<p>「只要自個兒能打得定主意，還怕什麼？」他二哥玉崑，捻將一柄單刀，混身朱光祖打扮的站在他後面看他卸裝，很較脆地鼓勵着他，嘴裏却不住的在噴出一股五茄皮的氣味來，不用詢問，就知道他又把今晚發的點心錢悄悄地買了酒喝了。</p>

<p>這件事認為無價值，不願意做，那件事無價值，不願意做，試問你願意做的什麼事？你是否已經充分準備著學識能力經騐，是以担當大事？如其不然，我勤你還是從小處人手，以工作為學習。</p>
<h3>蛇年蛇話</h3>
<p>— 鍾子芒</p>
<p>在都市的公司櫃窗裏，看到些美麗的蛇紋領帶；在博物院，看到一些眞的蛇皮浸在淡黃的酒精玻璃管一裏，那花紋是細密而具有圖案形的，當然，那些蛇紋領帶是相形見絀的了。不過，我想博物院所陣列的蛇皮，已經是只不過存了一個美麗的軀壳，如果眞是換了草野裏一灣一扭的活蛇，想起來是更有誘惑性的美麗了。</p>
<p>蛇在神話中就是一個誘惑人的東西：亞當與夏娃吃了禁果以致成了千古恨，那也是據說受了蛇的誘惑！蛇使人上當，而使人上當是在不知不覺之中，這是一個刁滑的動物，就是與他類似的蜈蚣還有一個兇像的紅頭，和無數機嘴般的爪，使人看了曉得有點畏懼，有些警戒，而蛇呢，旣有模做的蛇紋領帶發售於世，佩在男士們雪白的硬領與噴香水的雙樣之間，可見人們是早巳被蛇的美麗所誘惑了。</p>
<p>然而蛇是一個壞東西，牠貪婪，牠惡毒，牠以美麗，誘惑來粉飾這殘暴的一面，牠會吞食人，會散佈毒液，所以在旅行時是須帶一根手杖拿來打蛇，至於打的方法，則須眼靈手快，手上有勁，最好迎頭重擊；如打在蛇身，牠反會滑脫，牠的逃路，是左灣右轉富有曲折性，所以蛇一逃脫，瞬息不見的時候，便得馬上灣着路找，一定會使蛇就「上刑」的。</p>
<p>有蛇便打。無蛇也得防蛇，雖然「杯弓蛇影二是描摹一種懷疑的心理，可是，在我們目前生活中，隨時都得有這種　心。——何况現在不是「蛇影」晃幌馬?</p>
<p>「蛇年蛇話」，確是一種「雅士」的時與，引古證今，談詩談文，然扯扯拉拉，不知怎的因蛇常想起到社會上的一種人，而更使人想到一個蛇吞象的寓言——蛇吞象的鼻子，再還貪婪的吞着象，終於劈拍一聲，狹小了的蛇身脹爆了……</p>
<h3>米珠嘆　哀上海餓殍箴暴富米商</h3>
<p>— 楊雲史</p>
<p>天下貧如洗，忽多暴富翁。斗米十萬錢，得者非我農。尺帛中人產，得者非我工。銅山入私室，餓殍如飛蓬！東南歲大熟，連年收屢豐。飛挽滿江湖，曷為蓋藏空。內地傷穀賤，遏糶百貨窮。狼狽為壟斷，斷絕舟楫功。流脂東出海，萬艘急其供。區區狼藉餘，奇貨明珠同。旦暮百千萬，自詡陶朱公。食為我民天，滿地况兵戎。此時溫飽難，百里皆哀鴻。朝飢囂一妻，暮飽賣一童。哀哀我子民，何以繼飱饔！黃金戰白骨，米決知雌雄。夜靜無聲失，斷續雜雨風。獨肥利衆瘠，小子鳴鼓攻。相前二何太急，荳泣在釜中！饕餮不祥物，妖孽晨氣鍾。是宜投豺虎，五刑誅不容。殺一人者死，在律懲厥兇。日屠萬人不血刃，江頭殺氣干蒼穹。哀哉佛說地獄滿，天視天聽明且聰，餓鬼惡道多鄧通。</p>

<h3>譚「紡棉花」</h3>
<p>— 李雲影</p>
<p>最近菊壇方面，不料「紡棉花」這齣戲竟會紅到如此地步。論眼前能唱得好點的有兩位坤伶。一，吳素秋。二，童芷苓。先後在黃金更新連演次數根多。叫座成績早有觀衆看過，不需我再詳述。</p>
<p>但是，「紡棉花」這齣戲，晚近演來，祇演中間張三「回家調戲」一塲，其實前後向還有不少的塲子，像張三趣妻，出外貿易，張妻私姘，回家調戲，洩露姦情，姘夫設計，謀害親夫，案情暴發，公堂對審，雙雙伏法，全劇足演三個多鐘頭，與筱翠花的「雙釘記」，「馬思遠」等戲相似，是列在清八齣裏面的，在當年也的是一齣很負盛名的花且戲。</p>
<p>我還記得「紡棉花」的鼎盛時代是在民國十年左右，的確紅遍京滬一帶。當時是十三旦（即劉貽容並非侯俊仙。）和恩曉峯（唱花險的反串）常在故都廣德樓貼演。後來坤旦張文艷又在南方亦大唱特唱，居然都紅得不得了。可是北京是後紅的還有一個坤旦，叫碧雲霞，有位雅士（記不起名字了）還替她把這戲名改了中「絡絲娘」。此外還有個小馬五，在申江－帶，很紅過一陣，和「魏大蒜」這路戲常常貼出。待民十七年以後，因為革命北伐，這類戲當局曾下命禁演，所以冷落到將近十年的光景。誰知戰後的孤島，和淪陷的故都，竟又大興而特振呢！</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Clarifies National Policy: Defends Democracy, Criticizes Dictatorship, Acknowledges Domestic Security is Linked to the International Situation, Resolves to Exert All Effort to Aid Invaded Countries in Resistance, Requests Congress to Grant New Powers to Gain Executive Strength and Accomplish Tasks</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt presented to Congress and the nation a statement on foreign affairs, his words being remarkably clear, unprecedented. Members of Congress and listeners frequently applauded. Every seat in Congress was filled. Observers from the diplomatic corps included the British Chargé d'Affaires and ambassadors and ministers from various South American countries and China, Norway, Argentina, Persia, Switzerland, Finland, and Portugal. However, no representatives from Germany or Italy were seen. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, President Roosevelt addressed the 77th Congress, which was packed to capacity, delivering what is considered one of the most important speeches since President Wilson declared war in 1917. He began by recounting American history since 1789, then stated that while the peace of 1918 was unjust, the appeasement peace pursued before the Munich Conference, now being promoted in various countries under the "new order" of dictatorships, is even more unjust. The American people can no longer avoid confronting this "new order." Even within our peaceful nation, some secretly spread toxic propaganda to undermine its unity and incite unrest. Therefore, democracy is now faltering everywhere, and free nations are under constant attack. In the past sixteen months, this kind of aggression has completely destroyed the lives of many small and large independent nations, and those perpetrating this are continuing their actions. All other nations, regardless of size, are threatened. As the President of the nation, in fulfilling my constitutional duty to report to Congress on the state of the Union, I feel compelled to inform Congress that our future security and our democracy are deeply intertwined with events beyond our borders. Four continents are now arming themselves to defend the survival of democracy. Should this defense fail, the entire people and resources of the four continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia will be controlled by the victors.</p>
<p>Reject Appeasement</p>
<p>It is premature and inaccurate for anyone to boast that an unprepared America, with one hand tied behind its back, can defend the entire world with both hands. I will warn the nation that no realistic American can expect the restoration of international generosity, genuine independence, world disarmament, or any good cause from the dictators' peace. We must consistently reject those who skillfully promote appeasement, and we must be especially wary of a small group of selfish individuals who want to clip America's wings to feather their own nests. Now, some claim that America can avoid direct attacks from overseas. Indeed, as long as the British navy exists, America faces no such danger. Even without the British navy, no enemy would be foolish enough to launch an invasion of America by landing troops thousands of miles across the ocean without a military base. However, as aggressor nations maintain their offensives, they choose the time, place, and method of attack, not us. This is why the future of all American nations is in serious danger today, and why all government officials and members of Congress bear a heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>National Policy Includes Three Points</p>
<p>The national policy of the United States in dealing with international affairs is based on respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small, and on the belief that moral justice will ultimately prevail. This policy can be summarized in three points: first, in accordance with the clear expression of the popular will, regardless of party affiliation, America must proceed with comprehensive national defense. Second, America must provide full assistance to resolute peoples everywhere who, through their resistance, prevent the spread of war to this hemisphere. Third, moral principles and considerations of our own security dictate that America must never acquiesce to the peace dictated by aggressors or promoted by appeasers. America must adhere to these premises.</p>
<p>Accelerate War Production</p>
<p>The President continued, stating that current progress in arms production is not satisfactory. Although warship construction is ahead of schedule, aircraft production is behind schedule. The President stated, "I will ask Congress for a large increase in new funding and grant me new powers to continue the work that has already begun, and to expedite the manufacture of various military supplies to be delivered to countries currently at war with aggressors. Our most beneficial task is to strive to work like an arsenal, not only serving ourselves but also serving the countries resisting aggression. These countries at war do not need manpower, but they need trillions of dollars worth of defensive weapons. The time when they cannot pay cash is not far off. We cannot and will not allow them to surrender because they currently lack the ability to pay for the necessary weapons we know they need. Therefore, I do not advocate lending dollars to repay the debt in the future. I advocate that these countries continue to obtain war equipment in America, and that their orders fit into our own production schedules. The war equipment they order can almost all benefit our national defense in the future. For everything we ship overseas, they will return, after a reasonable period following the war, with the same items or, at our option, with other items they produce that we need."</p>
<p>Undaunted by Threats</p>
<p>We declare to all democratic nations, "We Americans are vitally concerned with your protection of freedom. We are now pouring our capabilities, resources, and organizational strength into giving you the power to restore and maintain a free world. We will supply you with an increasing number of ships, aircraft, tanks, and large cannons. This is our intention and our responsibility." In pursuing this intention, we are undeterred by threats from dictators who claim that our aid to democratic nations that dare to resist their aggression will be considered a violation of international law and an act of war. In reality, even if dictators unilaterally declare such aid to be an act of war, it is not an act of war. If dictators are preparing to wage war against us, they will not wait for us to commit an act of war. Did they wait for Norway, Belgium, or the Netherlands to commit an act of war before attacking them? Their sole focus is on a new and unilateral international law that lacks reciprocity in observance and is merely a tool of oppression in implementation.</p>
<p>Sacrifice to Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>The President continued, stating that everyone must be prepared to make the sacrifices required by the emergency situation. In the budget message, I will advocate that the portion of defense program funding derived from taxes should be greater than at present. No one should become wealthy because of this program. For the future, we aspire to the four freedoms of humanity: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Our nation has placed its destiny in the hands, minds, and hearts of hundreds of millions of free men and women, and in their faith in freedom under the guidance of God. What is freedom? It is the supreme value of human rights. Wherever people are fighting to win or defend this right, we will give them assistance. Our strength lies in the unity of our purpose. This noble ideal knows no end but victory. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>China and the United States: Loan Agreement Details Finalized, Signing Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters yesterday that the Chinese Stabilization Fund agreement will be signed soon. He said that the details of the agreement stipulate a loan of $50 million to China to stabilize Chinese legal currency. The agreement is expected to be completed within this week. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Local financial circles said today that the Chongqing government is expected to receive another loan from the United States. It is reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters yesterday that he will continue discussions with Chinese financial representative Song Ziwen this week.

<h3>China Greatly Excited by US President's Speech, Berlin Officials Temporarily Remain Silent, Rome Expresses Annoyance</h3>
<p>Chongqing – News today that President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday has greatly excited Chongqing officials. Although the government has not issued a formal comment, non-official sources have expressed complete agreement. Locals believe that the three major points of national policy announced by President Roosevelt are not only the most practical way to alleviate the world crisis, but also the most effective means of assisting countries resisting aggression. Chinese people particularly appreciate President Roosevelt's recognition that the wars in Europe and Asia are equally important, considering it an indication that the United States has resolved to provide full assistance, without discrimination, to countries fighting a life-and-death struggle against totalitarian powers. Authorities here said that anti-aggression democratic countries should be made into great arsenals to increase their resistance. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>London – The highest levels here consider President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday to be a challenge to German, Italian, and Japanese aggression. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, diplomatic circles in Washington predicted that if the Germans attempt to invade the British Isles next spring, President Roosevelt will eventually order American air force personnel in the air and naval forces to fight alongside the British army. American military experts generally believe that Germany will dare to launch such an invasion only after its air force has completely defeated the British air force. Diplomatic sources said that, extrapolating from President Roosevelt's message, if Britain is forced by circumstances, the United States may take military action against Germany without formally declaring war. Some also pointed out that President Roosevelt often mentioned how his predecessors, before 1941, "repeatedly engaged in undeclared wars in the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific in order to protect American interests and the principles of peaceful commerce." At the same time, according to informal voting results, the U.S. Congress is prepared to pass the new programs that would greatly increase national defense and provide unlimited aid to Britain. (International News Service Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Authoritative sources declared yesterday that the wording of a portion of President Roosevelt's annual report to Congress was "quite sharp," but they declined to make any comments before receiving the full text. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome – The initial impression among political figures here regarding President Roosevelt's annual message to Congress is that the United States is virtually driving the Axis powers to declare war on the United States. Many believe that the general content of the message is nothing more than condemnation of the Axis powers' ideologies, ideals, and goals. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>London – President Roosevelt's address to Congress has angered the Italians. This morning, the "Italian People's Daily" published an article accusing the American president of dealing with the totalitarian countries with prejudice and theoretical hostility. Some may ask why the United States does not declare war on the Axis powers. It should be known that the American president's ambiguous and hypocritical strategy aims to make the American people, who are normally opposed to intervention, compromise. For example, the American president's hypocritical scheme will cause the Axis powers' last legal sanctions on American ships transporting materials to Britain to be regarded as unreasonable aggression. This kind of scheme cannot deceive anyone. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – When the Deputy Spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau hosted foreign reporters today, and was asked about his thoughts on President Roosevelt's fireside chat, Ishii replied that there was nothing new in it. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome – Diplomatic officials stated yesterday that Roosevelt's message to Congress was very close to a declaration of war, so henceforth the United States should be regarded as a belligerent. They believed that this declaration was very timely, because the European war is now gradually tending to develop into Southeast Europe, and this trend has a great impact on the policies of the general small countries, because they are very likely to be forced "to make important decisions." (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Issues Declaration: Vows to Uphold Axis Alliance, Determined to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>London – According to Rome telegraph, the Italian cabinet issued a declaration today reaffirming Italy's loyalty to the German-Italian alliance and the Tripartite Pact. The cabinet chairman declared that Italy is determined to fight to the end, and expressed confidence in the abilities of the Italian people. The above declaration was issued at the same time as the Italian General Headquarters admitted the fall of Bardia. Another report from Rome stated that Italy's budget for next year will be £500 million, not including war expenses. Italy's last year's balance of payments deficit was approximately £350,000,000. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Should Sever Trade with Japan, Republican Congressman Suggests</h3>
<p>Washington – Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Rees yesterday suggested in the House of Representatives that President Roosevelt abolish commercial relations between the United States and Japan while Japanese troops occupy Chinese territories. Georgia Democratic Congressman Page introduced a bill to ban all foreigners from immigrating to the United States starting December 31, 1941, and to deport all foreigners in the United States. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Soviet Trade Negotiations Declared Stalled</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson admitted this morning that the trade talks between the Soviet Union and Japan in Moscow have been temporarily suspended, and that the negotiations for a temporary fishing agreement also temporarily encountered obstacles when the old agreement expired on December 31. However, Japan is not eager to conduct fishing agreement talks, because the previous agreement was also signed a long time after its expiration. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Preliminary Review of the British-Italian Confrontation</h3>
<p>Bardia in Italian-held Libya in North Africa is a good naval port and land fortress, also an air force base. Mussolini repeatedly stated that it was as solid as a rock. Now, after 19 days of fierce fighting, it has been captured by British forces. This is the most intense battle in recent months between Germany and Italy's attempts to undermine the British Empire in Africa, the Near East, and the Middle East, and Britain's efforts to block the German-Italian advance with a retaliatory stance to strike Italy. From the beginning of the British troops' entry into Bardia on the 4th of this month, the facts have already shown that the British army has won in the initial stage of this confrontation. The fighting ability of the Italian side, in contrast, is very weak, and its current situation is extremely difficult and dangerous, and has been quite exposed.</p>
<p>The initial confrontation in North Africa began last summer with the Italian army's occupation of British Somaliland. At that time, the slogan of the Italian army's advance was to immediately capture the British port of Aden and completely control the eastern end of the Red Sea. However, the Italian naval base of Assab on the west bank of the Red Sea, and the port of Djibouti, seized from the French, are only fifteen miles across the sea from Aden on the opposite shore. The British fleet's blockade prevented the Italian forces from uniting. The war on this side thus presented a temporary stalemate. So Italy shifted its target to British Kenya, and also achieved considerable progress. Once, under the cover of large-scale bombing, the Italian army advanced all the way to Muyaru, Benna, and Wagir. But on one hand due to the difficulty of transportation and lack of drinking water, and also because the British army and native troops adopted large-scale guerrilla tactics to harass the Italian army, the Italian army suffered a setback. What Italy gained during this period were only some barren desert areas, which were of no military significance. In addition, the Italian army also concentrated in Asmara, Gondar, and Addis Ababa in Abyssinia, attempting to launch a large-scale offensive against British-Egyptian Sudan, but no action was ever heard. So as of now, the fall of Bardia marks the end of the East African confrontation between Britain and Italy.</p>
<p>In October last year, the Italian army launched an offensive against Greece in the Balkans. However, under the strong resistance of Greece and the full support of the British naval and air forces, the Blackshirt warriors were repeatedly defeated. Not only did they fail to achieve their aim of occupying the various Greek prefectures and the naval ports of Salonika, etc., but even Durazzo, their largest naval port in Albania, is now threatened by the British-Greek Allied Forces. If Durazzo were to fall, a large door would be broken through that Italy relied upon to guard the entrance to the Adriatic Sea; and the British navy would not find it difficult to penetrate deep into the Adriatic Sea and directly attack Venice. Therefore, both sides are now trying their best to win the victory in the war around Elbasan. During this period, the Italian navy also suffered serious defeats. In the Battle of Taranto, almost half of the Italian fleet was destroyed. This has added infinite difficulty and threat to the subsequent Italian reinforcement of the Albanian front.</p>
<p>The recent loss of Bardia by the Italian army can be called the greatest defeat in recent times. From this, it lost its main base for attacking Egypt, shattered its plan to attack the British port of Alexandria, and had no hope of occupying Port Said and controlling the Suez Canal. In this Battle of Bardia, according to the British side, a total of 60,000 Italian troops were captured, before and after. Regardless of whether the number is accurate, it is undoubtedly a large number. In addition to military losses, it also dealt a near-fatal blow to Mussolini's plan to establish an African empire. If he wants to大規模增援,再取攻勢,反敗為勝, at least in the near future, it is impossible. The Italian side claimed that the British used forces of 450,000 troops and 1,000 aircraft in this operation. We do not need to ask whether the numbers are accurate, but it is enough to get a glimpse of how grand the scale of this battle is and how important its significance is.</p>
<p>Examining the impact: first, it has prevented the expansion of the war, so that some nearby countries will not be drawn into the vortex for the time being. If Italy could overcome the British fleet near Aden and occupy Aden, or capture Egypt and occupy the Suez Canal area, Britain's military deployment in the Near East, Middle East, and Africa would be launched immediately, and all countries such as Yemen, Hejaz, Iraq, and Egypt would be immediately drawn in; not only that, but the entire situation in the Balkans would also change and become the property of Germany and Italy; Spain on one side and Turkey on the other have the possibility of participating in the war. Now that things are temporarily peaceful, the green Italian army suffered a defeat. Second, regarding morale, Britain has repeatedly won against Italy in the past few months since the defeat of the European mainland war, which can greatly restore the belief in victory. In Italy, since Mussolini came to power, his army, navy, and air force suffered such a setback in this first experiment, which certainly cannot be said to be unrelated to the prestige of the Fascist Party and Italy. Third, although the future of the war is always subject to change, if it develops according to the recent trend and speed, then how Italy will fight side by side with Germany to the end will quickly become a problem; and Germany's having to send heavy troops to garrison Italy is a side explanation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Hubei Advance in Two Routes, Repelled by Fierce Interception by Chinese Troops, Japanese Attempt to Maintain Highway Traffic Between Wuhan-Changsha and Wuhan-Yangxin, Japanese Troops Advancing from Dashaping to Northeast of Tongcheng Have Retreat</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops in southern Hubei launched an offensive on the 4th of this month, attempting to strike the Chinese troops near Tongcheng in order to protect the highway traffic between Wuhan-Changsha and Wuhan-Yangxin. The Japanese troops split into two groups, one advancing from Dashaping towards the northeastern region of Tongcheng, was fiercely intercepted by Chinese troops and retreated back to Dashaping. The other group moved out of Yanglousi, attacking Zhongfang, north of Tongcheng, and by the evening of the 5th, was still in stalemate in Taoshuao. In total, the two routes of Japanese troops numbered no more than 3,000 men, and it is believed here that they will not achieve any results. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Miluo – On the night of the 3rd, the Chinese army, with extremely rapid action, destroyed more than ten kilometers of railway and hundreds of electric poles between Yangqisi and Pingminpu, and obtained hundreds of pounds of electric wire. When the Japanese heard the alarm and came to reinforce, they were hit hard by the Chinese army. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Yulin – On the Sui-Bao front, on the 28th, Japanese troops, together with the miscellaneous troops of Wang Ying's unit, crossed the river and attacked Hongnapula, and were repelled by the Chinese army. Another part of the Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Shangaigai, Weila Wang Lajing, En Yibei and other areas on the night of the asked date, and were fiercely resisted by the Chinese army. The fighting was fierce, and the Japanese were unable to sustain the situation and gradually retreated.

<h3>British Vanguard Reaches Outer Periphery of Tobruk, Makes Contact with Blackshirt Defenders; Remnants of Bardia Completely Cleared</h3>
<p>London: It is reported that the vanguard of the British army has reached the Tobruk area. The British Air Force has begun a heavy strike on the Italian military and naval air base to fortify it, in preparation for the British army's attack. Last night, British bombers began bombing, causing a huge fire that could be seen from Bardia, 55 miles away. Tripoli, hundreds of miles away, was also bombed. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources here, British mechanized forces have now made contact with the outer defenses of Tobruk. After capturing Bardia, the British army quickly advanced, giving the enemy no chance to catch their breath. According to reliable sources in London, the current British victories are as follows: since December 9th of last year, the British have captured a total of 70,000 enemy soldiers and put 94,000 Italian soldiers out of action. In various battles, the British army captured and defeated a total of three regular Italian divisions, two Blackshirt divisions, one mechanized division, and one supply column. As for the large quantities of military equipment obtained by the British army, it has not yet been possible to list them in detail. It is estimated that since the fall of Bardia, General Graziani's army has lost half of its artillery, trucks, and ammunition, not to mention the loss of soldiers. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent cabled from the British Army headquarters in the western desert that the Italian front line is now at Tobruk, which is about 100 miles inside the Libyan border and is the main naval and air base commanded by General Graziani. The British army has now cleared the remnants of Bardia, and there are no Italian troops between Bardia and Tobruk. British troops are patrolling back and forth. It is confirmed that Bardia has only one line of defense, while Tobruk has two lines of defense. The outer line is about 25 miles in circumference, and the inner line is about 11 miles. Regardless of the future trend of the Libyan war, Graziani must already be in a very serious position. In addition to a large number of Italian soldiers being captured, he has also lost half of the artillery, trucks, ammunition, and other war equipment of the Italian army in Libya. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>British Army on the Move in Bardia: Impatient British tank drivers drove their roaring tanks out of Bardia yesterday, heading west to the major Libyan port of Tobruk for another blitzkrieg. The drivers shouted, "On to Tobruk!" Tobruk has been bombed by the British Air Force for 24 hours, and the sky is ablaze with fire, which can be seen even from Bardia, 60 miles away. Australian infantry and other British Royal infantry are currently busy clearing the Bardia battlefield. The number of Italian soldiers captured there is estimated to be around 30,000. It is believed that this number may increase to 40,000 after the "inventory" is completed. The British army has established a battlefield headquarters in the Bardia administrative office. One opinion in the headquarters is that a large number of German aircraft may rush to Tobruk to assist in its defense, but the British army is determined to occupy it before the German air force arrives. According to unofficial information last night, a British vanguard has already reached 20 miles southwest of Tobruk. It is reported that General Graziani's troops have concentrated in Tobruk. (7th International dispatch)</p>
<p>Italy Admits Fall of Bardia</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian General Headquarters communique admits that the last stronghold of Bardia fell on the evening of January 5th. The communique went on to say that the Italian army suffered heavy casualties and missing. When British aircraft bombed Tobruk, Italian anti-aircraft artillery shot down two of them. On the Albanian front, the Italian army has recovered an important position and obtained weapons and ammunition. The communique also mentioned that in the city of Tekini, on the Sudanese border, British mechanized forces were scattered by Italian artillery fire. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A senior British military officer, in describing the battle to capture Bardia, concluded that if it were not for General Graziani's lack of talent and vision, or if Graziani was driven by the Fascist Party to take such unwise action, the Italian army would not have blindly advanced without considering their own safety to prevent defeat. It was extremely unwise. However, it seems that Graziani was forced to take this unwise action against his better judgment. The Italian intelligence department has also failed, as it has always been wrong about the number of British troops fighting, sometimes overestimating them, sometimes completely unaware of the arrival of British troops. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Morale of Blackshirt Troops is Low</p>
<p>London: A Reuters military commentator said that the fall of Bardia was indeed expected, but the greatness and speed of the British victory, the large number of Italian prisoners, and the small number of British casualties were unexpected. Italy's control of Libya has now been fundamentally shaken, as has its control of Abyssinia. The poor combat quality shown by the Italian army proves that Italian soldiers have no heart for war. The fact that so many Italian soldiers surrendered makes it impossible not to believe that the lack of fighting spirit is not just a local phenomenon, but that the entire Italian army stationed in Libya or the entire Italian army lacks fighting spirit. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, immediately took command and headed straight for Tobruk. With no other obstacles besides supplies, and with supplies now greatly increased, the British army's advance on Tobruk will not encounter any resistance until it reaches the port. Now that Bardia has fallen, it is impossible to say whether the Italian army in Tobruk will resist stubbornly. In fact, it is highly doubtful whether the Italian army in Libya is capable of continuing to mount a strong defense. Therefore, it would not be surprising to see Tobruk fall within a week.</p>
<p>German Aid Arrives Too Late</p>
<p>London: Rumors that 500 German aircraft and 10,000 German troops have gathered in various ports in southern Italy, preparing to go to Libya to reinforce, even if true, are too late. They can be regarded as empty threats. If German aircraft arrive in Libya, they will find that their airfields have been bombed and are in danger of repeated attacks. If the German side attempts to transport 10,000 troops to Libya by sea, they will all be buried at the bottom of the sea. The current British strategy may be to completely expel the Italian army from Libya and then turn to any other target. In addition to resisting the British advance, General Graziani, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in Libya, must also send some troops to protect the Italian farmers who live along the northern coast, as the tribal peoples who have been abused by the Italians and driven out of their old homes will rise up and attack unprotected Italian homes. The position of the coastal ports and airfields of Libya is extremely important to the British Navy and Air Force. Therefore, the British army should take the occupation of these ports and airfields as its top priority, so as to regain control of the Mediterranean and ensure the smooth flow of supplies from the east. At the same time, if the British army gains a foothold on the Libyan coast, it will be able to continue to attack Italy. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Port of Tripoli Raided by Air</p>
<p>Cairo: The British Air Force Headquarters here recently stated that on Saturday night, British aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing of Tripoli, a major Italian port in Libya. Important targets such as power plants, customs houses, docks, and ships docked in the port were bombed. Tons of bombs were dropped, and fires broke out in the area near the power plant and in the customs buildings, which could be clearly seen from 30 miles away at sea. In addition, an oil plant was also hit by multiple incendiary and high-explosive bombs. (7th United Press dispatch)</p>

It is reported that this squadron has been operating in the Libya area since Italy joined the war, without a moment's rest. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Greek Army Fights Bravely in the Cold; Progress on All Fronts; Italian Regular Army on the Albanian Front Replaced by Fascist Militia</h3>
<p>Athens: War reports say that although the Italian army in northern Albania has been reinforced by German tank units and is stubbornly defending Elba, the Greek army still attacked Elba this morning. Despite the extreme cold, with temperatures dropping to 25 degrees below freezing, the Greek army continued to advance in the cold, continuing to consolidate its new positions, gradually approaching Elba from all directions. A brief Greek communique stated, "Patrols and the Air Force are also active." However, according to unofficial claims, the Greek army has been victorious on all lines, and Italian counterattacks have been repelled. The Greek army, pressing on to Valona, has occupied several strategically important heights, and after occupying several coastal villages, has also defeated an elite Blackshirt division. In the areas of Tepe and Kilisura, the Greek army has advanced further, pressing the Italian army to retreat to Berat. More than 200 Italian soldiers were captured, including five officers. The most important victory was in the northeast, where the Greek army adopted guerrilla tactics, gradually descending the Hugerbi Valley, seizing important Italian positions, and pressing the Italian front line to retreat north to Librazhd, a deeply entrenched Italian base where German and Italian forces plan to mount a second defense. (7th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to a Free French News Agency correspondent in Istanbul, reports that the Italian regular army on the Albanian front is now being replaced by Fascist militia have been confirmed. It is reported that they are being transported by German Junkers transport aircraft. Fascist militia leader Starace inspected the Blackshirt stormtroopers in Albania on December 28 and 29. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia: The Zora newspaper here published an obituary editorial yesterday, saying that Germany's participation in the Italian-Greek war will be brought about by the Greek capture of Valona. The newspaper pointed out that if Valona falls into the hands of the Greek army, the passage to the Adriatic Sea will be opened, and the British fleet can then threaten Vienna and Munich. If Britain gains control of the Adriatic Sea, it can not only bomb the interior of the sea, but also penetrate and bomb Vienna and Munich, because Britain can use aircraft carriers and Valona as air bases. Military observers here also said that they believe that the great floods in southeastern Bulgaria may make large-scale military operations in the area impossible. The great floods may prevent the activities of Turkish troops along the border. The Turkish army there, in view of the ever-changing situation in the Balkans, has long been on the alert, ready to respond to any changes. (7th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Balkan Situation Changing; Bulgaria Will Become a German Vassal; Bulgaria Denies German Ultimatum Demanding Right of Way; It is Said that Germany and the Soviet Union Have Reached an Understanding</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: Senior officials told United Press last night that there is no doubt that Germany demanded to occupy Bulgaria at the end of last week and that Bulgaria has already succumbed. It is understood that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop submitted the request to Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov last Saturday. Well-informed circles say that the first step may be that Bulgaria invites Germany to send military advisers, and then the situation will be the same as in Romania. Well-informed observers say that the first step may begin tomorrow, the day after the Greek Orthodox Christmas. (7th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Bulgarian Capital: Rumors are circulating that German troops will occupy Bulgaria, but the country is now extremely peaceful. Senior Bulgarian officials strongly deny that Filov has met with Ribbentrop, or that Bulgaria has received a German ultimatum or request from any source. The people are celebrating the Greek Orthodox Christmas today. A United Press correspondent in Berlin reported that well-informed circles told him that the news circulating in the Yugoslav capital that Germany is preparing to enter Bulgaria tomorrow and peacefully occupy it is "too absurd, we don't need to comment."</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Just as people are generally worried that the German blitzkrieg will pass through the Balkans and reach Greece, news from the Southern capital yesterday said that Germany and the Soviet Union have already signed a secret agreement, allowing German troops to pass through Bulgaria, but diplomatic circles believe that this news should be viewed with absolute reservations. The general public believes that this news was created by the German side. News circulating outside that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov has accepted the ultimatum from Nazi troops to allow them passage has been formally and solemnly denied by the Bulgarian Embassy here. (According to news from the International News Agency in London, Soviet circles in London admit that the news from the Balkans is indeed disturbing, but say that this news does not match their recent news from Moscow, because Soviet circles in London claim that, according to recent news from Moscow, the Soviet Union is still strongly opposed to Germany's military use of Bulgarian territory, regardless of whether it can obtain Bulgaria's consent). However, news from the Southern capital yesterday strongly stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to German troops' passage with reservations, so that Germany will agree to support the Soviet Union's demands on Finland and Moldova in exchange.

<h3>Bulgarian Cabinet to be Reorganized; Pro-German Faction to be Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital: The Romanian "Current News" today telegraphed from the Bulgarian capital that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov may submit his resignation due to ill health, so the Bulgarian cabinet will be reorganized. It is said that the current Minister of Agriculture, Bagrianov, is a close friend of the Axis countries, so he is expected to become Prime Minister. If Bagrianov's succession as Prime Minister can become a reality, then the current Ambassador to Germany, Draganov, will be appointed as Foreign Minister. (7th Haitian News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Philippine New Market Law; Affects Overseas Chinese; China Has Filed a Protest</h3>
<p>Manila: Philippine President Quezon gave a speech more than a year ago expressing his hope that the retail business should be in the hands of Filipinos.

<h3>Reports of the Disappearance of British Female Aviator Amy Johnson; Parachuted into the River; Fear That She Has Been Tragically Drowned</h3>
<p>London: The famous British female aviator Amy Johnson, who holds long-distance flight records and has flown a light tourist plane across the Atlantic from east to west, is now serving in the British Air Force Auxiliary. On Sunday, someone saw her parachuting into the mouth of the Thames River while flying over it. Yesterday, reports surfaced that Ms. Johnson may have drowned. When Ms. Johnson jumped, a speedboat rushed to the rescue but found only the official documents authorizing her flight. An official bulletin stated that Ms. Johnson was "missing, presumed drowned." Ms. Johnson was previously the wife of Colonel Mollison and had crossed the Atlantic with her husband. In 1934, when Ms. Johnson visited the United States, she predicted that women would also participate in military service in the next war and said that she would enlist. This matter is still in the memory of the general public (7th dispatch from the International News Service).</p>

The Foreign Minister demanded that the British government take satisfactory steps to resolve the case promptly. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Officer's Diary from the Western Front</h3>
<p>This is the diary of British officer Captain Glebel fighting on the Western Front. The original text was published in the American "Saturday Evening Post." Here is a translation:</p>
<p>May 10, 1940: Around 4:30, I was awakened by anti-aircraft fire. At first, I didn't pay attention. But by 5:15, I felt that the artillery fire was extremely fierce, with a rumbling sound that never stopped, and I heard the rattling sound of airplanes circling overhead. I got out of bed and went to the window to look. At that time, dawn had just broken, and the sky was cloudless. I saw five enemy planes, arranged in a diamond formation, with anti-aircraft shells exploding around them, and the smoke obscured the sky. Soon, Allied fighter planes flew in, with the sound of machine guns rattling, and other planes followed. After the planes flew out of sight, the sound of artillery also subsided.</p>
<p>I went back to bed and slept until 7:00 when Garrison knocked on the door of Osbourough's room next door, and I was awakened again. Osbourough immediately entered my room and reported that the war had begun.</p>
<p>Our barracks were a small, rented house, quite comfortable. Osbourough took a bath first, ate breakfast quickly, and drove to headquarters. I got out of bed leisurely, ate breakfast, and sorted out documents. An hour later, I arrived at the office and confirmed that the Germans had opened up to Angers. The Anglo-French Allied forces had also entered Belgium. Many of our airfields had been bombed, but the losses were minimal. Five German bombers were shot down, and five of our planes were destroyed on the ground, but there were no casualties. It was heartbreaking that the planes were destroyed before they took off. The communication line of the Malley Air Force Detachment Headquarters was damaged by the bombing and took one or two hours to repair.</p>
<p>The town market was thriving, with flowers in full bloom, competing in beauty. The old woman who delivered cheese still arrived on time, without mentioning a word about the morning's events.</p>
<p>At 9:30, news was received that enemy paratroopers had landed in Gravenmacht and Limishi.</p>
<p>On the road from Luxembourg to Aix-la-Chapelle, troops were moving for ten miles. Everywhere I saw people with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>At 10:00, I went to the station to look for a box of Amontillado wine, but I didn't find it. I also managed to settle Colonel O'Dowdell's coachman, Hogen, and his batman, Spier. At 10:30, I returned to headquarters and learned that the war had begun.</p>
<p>Air Force Detachment Liaison Officer Langston had just returned.</p>
<p>On the way, he encountered two German bombers circling overhead, only forty feet high. One of them was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and the pilots were captured.</p>
<p>It was reported that the Belgian and Dutch armies had risen up to resist, and the French army had also crossed the Belgian border.</p>
<p>At 10:35, Air Force Commander Barratt arrived with a pipe in his mouth, a smiling face, and staff members.</p>
<p>Although the Air Force Detachment had dispatched planes this morning for reconnaissance, there was still no news reported.</p>
<p>At this time, a report was suddenly received that forty enemy troop transport planes had landed in The Hague.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters seemed unprepared. There were quite a few fake officers and soldiers. Information came one after another, with hardly a second of free time. Now the facts have come. But there was no news about our troops or planes, no telegrams, no information, and no telephones.</p>
<p>The air raid siren was installed on the roof of the post office, almost directly opposite our barracks. The strange sound of the siren made people tremble. Personally, I felt that the local people were agitated more by the psychological effect of the air raid siren than by the actual bombing. This morning, many civilians were killed and injured on the highway near the Tranquesney railway, which was a tragedy.</p>
<p>May 12, 9:00 PM: There is nothing to record today. In fact, I haven't written a word yet. I was on duty last night, so I don't have the energy to write in my diary today.</p>
<p>News came that all the drivers of our Air Force Task Force were willing to be suicide squads. Four were selected, and the bridges in the town of Maastricht, which had not been destroyed, were completely destroyed. However, although they had accomplished their ambitions, it is feared that they had all died for their country. They gave the Allied forces valuable time to calmly defend the predetermined line on the Dir River, east of Beijing and Brussels.</p>
<p>From the Swiss border to the North Sea, the war has been unfolding on a large scale. The enemy's feinting attacks make it difficult to distinguish between the real and the unreal. The situation in the Netherlands is particularly bewildering, making it unpredictable. Contradictory news came one after another. The general impression was that the Germans had failed to break through the Allied line at one stroke as they had expected. Although Maastricht was broken through by the enemy, it was already expected.</p>
<p>A British pilot was shot down by the enemy this morning between Tongeren and Tirlemont. He escaped for a while and met several Belgian infantrymen. They mistook a team of German tanks for a Belgian tank team and went forward to meet them, only to be shot back by a burst of bullets.</p>
<p>They all escaped into a forest. In the forest, they found several civilian corpses. The pilot took off the clothes of one of the corpses, took off his uniform, disguised himself as a Belgian farmer, and crossed the German line. Half an hour later, he hitched a ride on a Belgian car and found his way to this headquarters. Now he is going to the Fifth Air Force Detachment to return to his unit. I won't write any more tonight. I must get some sleep.</p>
<p>May 13: This morning, the war situation seems quite stable, but it is gradually unfolding. Only the left wing of the French Seventh Army is threatened by the German mechanized forces. The enemy mechanized forces are passing through Breda in dense formation, stretching for twelve miles. The bomber command saw this as a good target and wanted to show its skills. I hope that the reinforcements requested by the French will soon be effective.</p>
<p>For four days, the Germans have never bombed the Anglo-French forces entering Belgium, which is quite strange. Our advance seems to be what the Germans wanted. Does the French General Headquarters not know the danger of encountering war and should try to avoid it?</p>
<p>May 14: The serious news of the fall of Sedan came. Sedan is located on the banks of the Meuse River. The crossing at Dinant, about fifteen miles south of Namur, has been occupied. I was on the night shift, and at midnight I suddenly received news that the situation in Sedan had deteriorated. The enemy had occupied a salient 15 kilometers long and 10 kilometers deep. Senior officers held an emergency meeting. On the British side, there was Air Force Commander Barratt. On the French side, there were General Dasti, General Yeffrie, Corps Commander General Billotte, and General Bingzhi's liaison officer D'Arno, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Feyumin's liaison officer Bessanditon. The meeting was tragic and moving. Most of the French officers were heartbroken and in tears, and because the French army retreated from its fortified position without resistance, it was ashamed and embarrassed, even crying out loud. This kind of thing is really too unimaginable!</p>
<p>According to D'Arno, the French army has 30 fighter jets in the Sedan area. Heavy artillery is bombarding the enemy with all its strength. The infantry is scheduled to launch a counterattack at 11:00, led by tanks. The morale of the French army is high, and it hopes to defeat the Germans in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>2:15 PM: The French counterattack in the Sedan area has been delayed by 30 minutes. This is a fatal pause. At the same time, the Germans continued to exert their strength and have extended the breakthrough gap by three miles to the left and right wings, and three miles deeper into the wilderness. The French artillery has all been lost. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Tri-Educational Strike Resolved Satisfactorily Yesterday</h3>
<p>Higher Salaries to be Increased Next Semester; Classes Resume Today</p>
<p>The faculty and staff of the San Yu Elementary and Middle School at No. 15, Lane 920, Xin Kai Road, requested higher salaries from the school, but did not receive a satisfactory response, leading to an unfortunate strike. This created an unprecedented event in the isolated education sector. Educational figures across the city were paying close attention to the developments of this matter, and educational authorities, in particular, given their responsibilities, mediated with the utmost speed and sincerity. The San Yu School Board also made every effort to assist. Because both the faculty and the school authorities were deeply aware of the difficulties of the time, understood each other, were open and honest, and treated each other with sincerity, this crisis was resolved smoothly in the shortest possible time. Our reporter learned the details as follows: The conditions put forward by the faculty and staff yesterday were divided into three items. It is understood that the conditions they raised were very simple and not entirely as reported. They only requested a 30% salary increase starting next semester. Because the school was unable to respond quickly, it led to the unfortunate strike. Educational authorities and school board members immediately traveled day and night to mediate. Because both sides were able to consider the overall situation, after negotiations, the school decided to increase the salaries of all faculty and staff by 27% across the board starting next semester, which is 90% of the original request of the faculty and staff. The faculty and staff expressed satisfaction and fully accepted the offer. They originally intended to resume classes yesterday, but due to insufficient time to notify the students, both sides decided to resume classes today as usual. The school has already issued a notice in the name of the school to parents, instructing students to take note. Thus, a crisis came to an end.</p>

<h3>Food: Despite the Large Arrival of Foreign Rice in Shanghai, Rice Merchants Remain Unshaken and Refuse to Sell Stockpiled Goods, Unwilling to Order More Foreign Rice, Are They Intending to Starve the People of Shanghai?</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market continued to be in a stalemate. The price of foreign rice continued to soar due to various restrictions, exceeding the border price. Under the close supervision of the authorities, there was little possibility of rising, but speculators' hopes remained strong, unwilling to sell off. They would rather let the stockpiled rice rot and decay than comply with the deadline to release it for the benefit of the people. Such a wolfish heart and insatiable greed is also due to the fact that the authorities have not yet taken legal action against hoarders. The rice market has not been systematically and purposefully rectified, so the ferocity is increasing, unwilling to sell the goods on hand, so there are no goods on the market for buyers to buy. Also, seeing that border crossing transactions were punished with imprisonment, they were also slightly cautious, unwilling to take hasty actions and buy in excess of the limit, Ningyuan sat tight, fortunately, each rice store has stocks, not worried about no goods on the market, so the market on the market, the transaction is sparse, like a dead market, the opening spot, only 79 yuan of Haiphong red rice, and 78 yuan of sub to 76 yuan 3 jiao of Mi Lv, and sharp crushed, opening 76 yuan sub to Mi Qi 68 yuan, other Saigon one or two fire twist small twist and other goods, the market is not out of style, secretly afraid of still doing its illegal trading, only the road of each goods fell unanimously, Gai because the price is in line, importers are very hard to sell in the market, January small twist has opened 86 yuan, yesterday only 84 yuan to sell still no takers, and Saigon No. 1 January has opened 96 yuan, yesterday Changyi (another draft is Heyi Foreign Firm) threw two batches, initially 95 yuan, afternoon has reduced to 94 yuan, the transaction only a few hundred tons, Gai afraid of more orders will prevent its stockpiling and hoarding, also, the price is two yuan higher than the previous market, the original packaging returned to the profit floating households competing to seek out, the market also stepped on a small number of jiao and one or two yuan different, December 9 small twist only 931 yuan 2 jiao, January 16 loading initially 84 yuan half, followed by 84 yuan 3 jiao to 84 yuan, and the entrants still do not see food, the transaction only 400 tons, enough to see that there are many orders for foreign rice, and rice merchants are unwilling to order, especially to see its deliberate manipulation, harming the people's food, is undeniable.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica and other national rice is continuous and not much, but because foreign rice is soft, the sales field has turned inferior, and the seller's willingness to sell has become more relaxed, so it forms a situation of no honor or disgrace, such as Kunshan husk of white japonica is still open about 106 yuan, green horn husk of thin rice 101 yuan to 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market is said to be in a sluggish state, and the road to go is even weaker, so although the seller voluntarily devalued the price and sought to sell, it is still difficult to attract a large stomach, the result of the selling price fell short by one yuan, and the number of transactions in the city is still mostly no more than three or four white packages, a total of Yi澳白元 open 91 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan 82 yuan, sub to yellow 78 yuan out of zero only.</p>
<p>Foreign rice to Shanghai is very surge-like, yesterday Jardine Matheson Yuyuan wheeled to the port, shipped from Hong Kong 18,377 packages, docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading, and decided to China Postal Shipping Company Zhimanaike shipped from Hong Kong 1,700 tons (number of packages unknown) has arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd of this month and docked at Peidong Blue Smoke Stack Wharf for unloading, this shipment of foreign rice, the past few days ago missed report, Huarun Foreign Firm manager of the French lost Albert Sarrant, directly loaded from Saigon 2,450 tons of corn, etc. has been recorded in the previous newspaper, now known that the wheel has been imported at 4:45 pm yesterday, about 7 o'clock can arrive at the scheduled Hongkou Shuntai docking, today began to unload, (Z祖)</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Falls as Fixed Arrivals Cease</h3>
<p>Flour prices fell yesterday as foreign flour became unsustainable. In terms of sources, in addition to a new batch arriving from Hong Kong, it is said that another ship of Australian flour will arrive within the year, and a large number of new Canadian flour deals have been made, which can be said to be endless fixed arrivals, so people's hearts have gradually softened, and general hoarders are thinking of selling off, and this street's actual sales, both have flat-selling flour supply, its needs are naturally reduced, and customer sales are also waiting and watching, the entire city sells more than 8,000 packages of Kaihua Wuzhonglou brand Australian flour, initially opened 24 yuan 3 jiao half, stepping on to 24 yuan 5 fen, has already entered the customs in the afternoon, compared to the previous day returned a small half yuan or so, Beautiful brand 24 yuan 2 jiao, Wild Boar brand 24 yuan 3 jiao half, still no formal takers.</p>
<p>Also, flour imports and exports have, the day before yesterday Taikoo Jiangsu wheel shipped from Hong Kong 9,000 packages, has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper, now known that yesterday Jardine Matheson Yuyuan wheel arrived at the port, in addition to shipping a large number of foreign rice from Hong Kong, also has foreign flour 5,000 packages, exports today Jiangsu wheel shipped 2,000 packages, shipped to Xiamen, Taikoo managed by the French wheel Tranninh, loaded 3,000 packages, today exported, shipped to Haiphong, (年)</p>

<h3>Securities Public Bonds Continue to Rise New Highs Appear Again Big Rallies with Small Corrections</h3>
<p>Public bond gray market prices yesterday, on the back of continuous gains in recent days, saw new highs across the board in the morning. Category A bonds broke through 8 yuan, and Category C bonds broke through 7 yuan. Although Category C bonds still hit a new high of 7.675 yuan in the afternoon, the market then saw a large number of profit-takers emerge, leading to a big rally followed by a small correction. This movement broke the 8-yuan mark for Category A bonds, and Category C bonds retreated to 7 yuan. However, the final results were still higher than the previous day. The overall trend remains that rises are easier than falls, but a correction is inevitable. It is noted that Yuxing and Xinfu were the biggest buyers this time, suggesting they must have considerable underlying strength. The lack of available bonds in the market also deterred short sellers. The future may see a slight correction. Yesterday's trading was even more vigorous, with Yuxing and Xinfu constantly buying throughout the morning and afternoon, while Shenchang, Wuyuan, and Yizhong constantly selling, creating a fairly balanced situation. Dingkang, Lianhe, and Xianjin bought first and sold later. Other buyers included Renchang, Datong, and Delong in the morning, and Yitai, Wantai, Tongkang, and Jiufeng in the afternoon. Sellers were more widespread, mostly profit-takers and short sellers. Dahua, Lianyi, Runli, Renfeng, and Hu Heji sold off in the morning. Those who sold in the afternoon included Tongshun, Lemao, Yichang, Xiekang, and Nos. 11, 25, and 41, all of whom divested substantial amounts. Therefore, although the market price was pushed up by Xinfu and Yuxing, it fell back very quickly afterward. The final result was still a rise of 5 fen to 6 jiao and 5 fen, with particularly high trading volume totaling about 3.5 million yuan. The 96 bonds have disappeared without a trace. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 15 shares of Dasheng Third Factory were traded at a price of 33.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The Taikoo Ma-la Rubber Company, managed by the British firm Xiangmao Foreign Firm, has set the date for the distribution of the interim dividend for the one-year period from January 21 to the end of March 1941, at 2 jiao of national currency per share.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Stock Exchange's potential remains good. Although profit-taking by bulls continued throughout the day, buyers occasionally stepped in to maintain the market. Trading in famous stocks was not as heavy as in previous days. Some stagnant stocks were surprisingly popular. For example, Zhongying shares rose to a new high of 9.3 yuan, and Zilaihuo shares were also traded at 19.4 yuan. Among the famous stocks, Shanghai Banking Corporation and Xiangtai Timber were the most active, but both saw large-scale selling, with the former at 41 yuan and the latter at 5.7 yuan. Rubber stocks made slight progress, with frequent transactions.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Monday dispatch): Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks remained flat. Only the London-registered shares of HSBC rose by one pound, to a price of 76 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Optimism among Traders Cotton Yarn Downtrend Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which experienced a sharp drop the previous day, entered a consolidation phase at the opening yesterday morning. However, actual consumption was sluggish due to the approaching end of the year, and purchasing by various guilds was slow. At the same time, the exchange rate was calm and showing signs of lengthening, and the gold guild was inclined to sell off, leading to a weak market sentiment. However, some traders were not pessimistic, so the market appeared hesitant. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,345 yuan, and the low price was 1,334 yuan, but it closed at 1,348 yuan. In the afternoon gray market, due to the exchange rate tightening and the price of gold rising sharply, it initially traded at 1,350 yuan, then at 1,355 yuan. Today, 15 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Xiamen, and 910 bales are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, and because the price of gold rose and then contracted the previous afternoon, market sentiment was average. Most speculators were thinking of shorting. The opening price was 5,341 yuan. With this opening, there were quite a few buyers, and it rebounded to 1,346 yuan. It fluctuated for a long time outside of 1,340 yuan. It was then reported that the exchange rate had stabilized and the price of gold was slightly weak, human sentiment softened, and actual demand was sluggish. Sellers and leveraged long positions were unloading, gradually falling to 1,334 yuan. After 11 a.m., short covering pushed it back up to 1,342 yuan. It is noted that the total trading volume in half a day was 6,170 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was flat. The amount bought by each guild is listed below:</p>
<h3>Double Horse Yarn Why the Sudden Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>The recent yarn market, after discovering a new high, quickly retreated. The details of what happened are briefly reported below:</p>
<p>(1) From the perspective of foreign customers, in early December of last year, they suddenly started dragging in goods, anticipating the exchange rate would contract. This later materialized, and the price of gold soared. As a result, Double Horse followed suit, rising to a peak price of 1,435 yuan on December 27, a jump of 228 yuan compared to the low of 1,207 yuan at the beginning of the month. However, most of the market shifted its goal to seeing further price increases. Unexpectedly, those who had profited took the opportunity to exit, so after the new year, the local exchange rate became calm and showed signs of lengthening. As a result, general leveraged accounts, recognizing the unfavorable environment, decisively closed out their positions, easing the pressure, and a counter-reaction began suddenly. The market price plunged by a substantial 40 to 50 yuan. Yesterday morning, the lowest price was 1,334 yuan, a drop of 101 yuan from the high. Therefore, in the afternoon, as the price of gold rose slightly, speculators became active again, and the trend reversed upward.</p>
<p>(2) According to market sources, actual sales in Hong Kong are particularly sluggish. Apart from 32-count single yarn being more palatable, other types of yarn have little appeal. Therefore, Double Horse yarn is the object of speculation by the masses, and the price difference with other miscellaneous brands of yarn is too large. The price of 20-count Great Girl yarn is within 1,100 yuan, and the price of 20-count Double Globe yarn is 1,140 yuan. Given this varying degree of high and low prices, some believe that it is more prudent to buy low-priced goods than to buy Double Horse.</p>
<p>(3) Because sales of Double Horse yarn spot goods from foreign warehouses are not picking up, they need to be stored in warehouses, requiring insurance, rent, and other miscellaneous fees, and speculators are not welcoming them. For this reason, the warehouse receipt price for Double Horse is tens of yuan cheaper. Given the above situation, most are giving up on Double Horse. Therefore, with a counter-reaction, there was a sudden drop of over 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The fundamental issue cannot be separated from actual consumption. If sales are widespread, the upward momentum will naturally be consolidated. Otherwise, artificial manipulation, with A making a profit and reselling to B, and so on through several transactions, may ultimately be satisfactory, but the current situation relies solely on rumors to expand and contract. In short, this market rose before the event, so it has the phenomenon of falling after the event. (Shan)</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills' Demand is Weak</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation lacks any excitement. This is because the exchange rate is stable, and orders for Indian cotton are arriving in Shanghai one after another, so market sentiment is flat. However, trading among traders is showing slight improvement, but demand from mills remains weak.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton in the New York cotton market initially fell due to selling by speculators. Subsequently, it rose because of increased domestic consumption of raw cotton figures and the rise in Wall Street stocks. As a result, the closing price rose compared to the previous day. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, fell by two rupees.</p>
<p>Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been extraordinarily quiet in recent days. All parties are uninterested. Japanese manufacturers have a stronger desire to purchase, but only do scattered trading. Traders remain in a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Market Optimism Returns</h3>
<p>The piece goods market yesterday was tending toward the flat and weak, closing slightly firm. Large traders absorbed amounts and held them firmly, while small traders transacted slightly at cheaper prices. Sales to customers also lacked wholesale transactions. The selling prices of some coarse, fine, and twill cloths fell by 1 to 2.5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth was stable. Market sentiment for the future unanimously turned firmer. The total transaction volume of various cloths in this street was more than 500 pieces. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang purchased more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, poplin, etc. The Guangdong-Hong Kong gang purchased more than 100 pieces of khaki, colored cloth, and various cloths, etc. Overseas, Singapore, Little Luzon, and other places purchased more than 5,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth.</p>
<p>East cloth first fell and then rose, and the market turned bullish. White goods, led by fine cloth, fell step by step in the morning, with the lowest price falling to 40.01 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in yarn prices in the exchange, small traders rushed to take delivery, pushing prices up round by round. The closing price was 41.4 yuan, up 5 jiao per piece. Other miscellaneous brands of fine cloth also uniformly rose in price. The new warehouse receipt for Four Gentlemen's Serge rose to 1.1925 yuan, while the old warehouse receipt widened the gap, only at 1.1375 yuan.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports on the 8th: 1,420 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 34 pieces shipped to Xiamen, and 400 pieces shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Decline More Severely</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend yesterday was weak and market sentiment was very soft, so the downtrend intensified. The guild's clearing price for spot goods of 24-grade white was 79 yuan for local warehouses and 78.5 to 78 yuan for foreign warehouses, down 1.6 yuan. Dutch cotton white BS mark was initially 78.2 yuan, then 78 yuan, and then 77.5 yuan, down 7 jiao. Dutch red spot goods were 66.6 to 66.2 jiao. The 15th of January delivery was 67 to 66.3 jiao, down 1 yuan. Taikoo Caster White B mark was 78.8 to 78.5 jiao, then 78 yuan, down 1 yuan. DY mark was 77.5 to 77.2 jiao, down 8 jiao. HX mark was 77.3 to 76.8 jiao, down 7 jiao. H mark red was 64 yuan, and old goods were 63.8 jiao, with a smaller decline. The factory's No. 1 ice was 100 yuan, and Jingming ice was 101 yuan, down 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods Golden Needles and Raw Peanuts are Both Tight</h3>
<p>The golden needle vegetable market continued to tighten yesterday. The top grade goods were opened for sale again at a price of 125 yuan, up 5 yuan. The rest also tightened accordingly.</p>
<p>Raw peanuts, such as those from Weihaiwei, were restricted due to local controls and could not be shipped out, so there was a shortage of goods arriving, and the market trend tightened. Yesterday, Qingdao Renyang Zhuang was 61.5 yuan, general goods were 58 yuan, Yangzhou Ren was 53 yuan, Guzhen Ren had recently arrived and was being opened for inspection, about 52 yuan, and Xuzhou peanuts were 41 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea The Silk Market Suddenly Sees Prosperity</h3>
<p>The local silk market, affected by the sudden rise in silk prices, swept away the dull atmosphere and presented a prosperous scene. In the past two days, various export firms have had considerable interest. Statistics for the full day's transactions are estimated at around 250 bales.</p>
<h3>Sundries Cigarette Market Consolidates Slightly</h3>
<p>The cigarette market situation had a rather strong upward trend within the year. In recent days, the red trend has gradually fallen. Because the financial situation is trending toward balance and human sentiment is stable, those holding goods are selling off to take profits, and buyers are instead weak. Also, factories are distributing more goods, so when the market opened for sale yesterday, the downtrend was very strong. For example, Old Knife Brand opened at 925 yuan, and Great Britain Brand opened at 1,325 yuan, about 50 yuan less than the year's peak. Little Fairy was 658 yuan, Five Hua Brand was 660 yuan, Pin Hai Brand was 870 yuan, and Ten-Branch Qianmen Brand was 327 yuan per 10,000. The China National Cigarette Company's Merry Brand Golden Mouse Brand followed the consolidation and added more than 10 yuan. (Kun)</p>
<h3>Metals Steel Bars and Iron Billets Both See High Prices</h3>
<p>Bamboo Joint Steel Bars: Since the new year, they have been particularly lively because the Jiangzhe inland river gangs have been embellishing things, and the local construction gangs also have the need to absorb. Added to this is that the situation in the Pacific is becoming more tense, and the source is limited, so inventory is not abundant. Therefore, people's hearts are proud, and opening prices are showing. For example, three- and four-point patterns must open at 1,300 yuan per ton, and five-point to one-inch coarse goods are also sold at 1,230 to 1,240 yuan per ton, each higher than before by about 20 to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Black Iron Billets: Quite a few of the Iron Billet transactions were absorbed by the thermos factory on this street yesterday and the day before. The small sales of merchants from North Road and local merchants are also good. Therefore, the market situation is fairly good, and people in the industry are still optimistic. The market is also trending higher step by step. Yesterday, 2,000-pound original bundled goods were sold at 1,200 yuan to 1,300 yuan per piece.</p>

<h3>Extra Tax Case of Municipal Council Various Parties Hope for Cautious Discussion Citizens' Livelihoods are Increasingly Difficult to Bear Extra Tax and Reduced Administration Should Be Carried Out Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's proposed increase of 40% in tax revenue to make up for its 20 million yuan deficit has aroused opposition from the majority of Chinese and foreigners. With residents already struggling to cope with daily necessities such as food and fuel, they are now burdened by an increase in rent. The difficulties of life will become even more unimaginable. A fierce dispute is bound to erupt at the Special Ratepayers' Meeting on the 23rd, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>About 20 Million Yuan in Extra Taxes</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's current tax revenue is 14,146,500 yuan in land rent and 21,266,000 yuan in house tax, plus 1,380,000 yuan in special taxes outside the concession. Now, with an increase of 40%, land rent can generate an additional 5,658,600 yuan, house tax can generate an additional 8,506,000 yuan, and special taxes outside the concession can generate an additional 552,000 yuan, totaling about 14,715,000 yuan. Adding the increase in various miscellaneous taxes, it will not be less than about 6 million yuan. This increase in revenue would be sufficient to make up for the 20 million yuan deficit.</p>
<p>Citizens' Economies Cannot Bear the Burden</p>
<p>However, disregarding the difficulties of the citizens and rashly taking this approach of "draining the pond to catch the fish" may make it difficult to maintain security in the concession in the future. Therefore, the general public hopes that the Special Ratepayers' Meeting will carefully discuss this tax increase, taking into account the burden on the citizens and ensuring social security. Rather than increasing taxes, it would be better to reduce administration or replace Westerners with Chinese to reduce remittances and save money. Even if there is a need for an increase, it is necessary to consider whether the general public has the ability to bear it.</p>
<p>Location of Meeting Has Been Selected</p>
<p>According to a notice issued by the Municipal Council yesterday, the Special Ratepayers' Meeting to be held at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd of this month will take place at the public grandstand of the Race Club at 305 Jing'an Temple Road. The rules of procedure for the meeting are the same as those for the previous meeting. Taxpayers in need can obtain them from the Secretariat of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Is Raging and Needs to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that the labor unrest in Shanghai today (7th) not only has not ended, but new labor disputes have arisen and continue to disrupt the normal situation in the city. Only the workers at the Xujiahui Orphanage, who demanded improved compensation, reached a satisfactory settlement with the employer today. This is the first dispute resolved this year. Along the Suzhou River,</p>
<p>Stevedores</p>
<p>Approximately six hundred people, who demanded a wage increase but were unsuccessful, are still on strike this morning. It is reported that although these stevedores are short-term workers, they have a union organization, so they can act in unison. Also,</p>
<p>Silver Automobile</p>
<p>Company drivers have submitted a request for increased wages and rice subsidies and asked the company to respond immediately. Many believe that if a proper solution is not reached, it may lead to a slowdown in work. Also,</p>
<p>The Commercial Press</p>
<p>1,800 employees learned today that their request for improved treatment has been rejected by the Hong Kong headquarters. It seems difficult to quickly resolve the labor unrest. Also,</p>
<p>The French-language "Daily News"</p>
<p>More than 40 employees were promised a rice subsidy of 10 yuan by the company in October of last year, and it was promised that the salary would be appropriately increased when the price of rice reached 80 yuan, and that additional subsidies would be given until the end of November. The price of rice far exceeded 80 yuan, but the company did not fulfill the previous promise. Instead, it drove the employees out of the company and hired White Russians and a small number of new workers to carry out the work. It intends to dismiss all the employees. All attempts at mediation have been rejected. It has been more than three weeks. The employees are deeply oppressed and appeal to society to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Excessive Profits Tax Extension of Filing Deadline</h3>
<p>Tax Collection Office Explains Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding the filing deadline for excessive profits tax and the inability of taxpayers to request a review of cases determined directly, the various income tax offices recently received the following explanations from the Tax Collection Office: (1) Article 11 of the amended Extraordinary Period Excessive Profits Tax Regulations states: "If the taxpayer fails to report the profit amount within the specified period, the competent tax collection agency may conduct an investigation and determine the tax payable, and order payment. The taxpayer may not request a review of the aforementioned decision." The specified period refers to the filing period stipulated in Article 6 of these Regulations, "If calculated according to the business year, the taxpayer shall report the profit amount to the competent tax collection agency within one month from the date of settlement." (2) Article 6 of the Implementing Rules states: "If the profit of a profit-making enterprise is settled annually and cannot be declared within one month after the end of the year, an extension shall be granted." This article is a relief provision and shall only be applied after the taxpayer submits a report to the competent tax collection agency to verify that it is indeed impossible to settle and declare within one month after the end of the year. Otherwise, the provisions of Article 11 of the Regulations shall still be followed.</p>
<h3>Beggars Will Disappear Within Ten Years</h3>
<p>Beggar Shelter Plan</p>
<p>Maurice, a brigadier of the Salvation Army who manages the beggar shelter, told reporters yesterday that the beggar shelter plan will ensure that residents of Shanghai will no longer encounter beggars on the streets within ten years. Since the opening of the shelter, about 300 beggars have stayed in it, and there are still more than 1,200 vacancies. At a rate of 50 people admitted per day, it is expected to be full by the beginning of next month. In addition to providing food, clothing, and shelter, the shelter also teaches beggars handicrafts to enable them to be self-reliant. Children account for about 25% of the beggars and will also be educated. A school for beggar children is currently under construction. For beggars who are sick or addicted to drugs, the Salvation Army will hire full-time doctors to treat them or help them quit drugs. Beggars from other provinces stranded in Shanghai will be sent back to their places of origin after they have stayed in the shelter for a certain period of time. Maurice pointed out that the beggar shelter is not only a place to avoid hunger and keep warm, but also a place to punish the greedy and lazy. Beggars who are kept in the shelter are assigned a fixed job every day and are never allowed to eat their fill without doing anything.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Scheduled to Hold Board Meeting Today</h3>
<p>At 4:30 p.m. today, the Municipal Council will hold a regular board meeting in the Municipal Council's General Office conference room to discuss various reports submitted by the council's various subcommittees and other routine cases.</p>
<h3>Spring Gift Military Aid Movement Citizens Responding Unanimously Upholding Past Spirit and Fulfilling National Duty Thrift Movement Committee Urges Participation</h3>
<p>Since the National Comforting General Association launched the Spring Gift Military Aid Movement last year, it has been promoted uniformly throughout the country. The people of this city, although limited by the environment, do not dare to lag behind in patriotism and have also responded enthusiastically, achieving considerable results. The City's Thrift Movement Committee, in order to continue to encourage morale, make persistent efforts, and complete the great task, as the Spring Festival is approaching in an instant, especially wrote an article yesterday urging people from all walks of life to uphold the spirit of the past and work hard to promote it. The original text reads roughly: "It has been investigated that the abolished lunar Spring Festival will arrive in an instant. At this time, there is much unnecessary consumption in general society. In times of prosperity, it is okay to make some embellishments, but in this extraordinary period, when the life and death of the nation and the country are at stake, every citizen has the heavy responsibility of reversing the tide and restoring the country. Therefore, donating to the Spring Gift Military Aid is the minimum national duty of our compatriots in the rear. In view of this, the Committee has already strictly ordered its subordinate organizations to uniformly promote it in order to save unnecessary consumption, transfer the object of gifts, strengthen the anti-Japanese construction mood, and complete the great cause. However, this matter is significant and requires the strength of the masses to be effective. It is hoped that enthusiastic compatriots from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically and work hard to promote it so as to obtain satisfactory results. The future is deeply promising."</p>

<p>Government-Subsidized Rice Sold Out Instantly</p>
<p>The eighth phase of government-subsidized rice sales, after a long period of preparation, finally began on schedule yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The heavens were kind, and the rain stopped and the wind ceased in an instant. Although the cold was biting, the common people buying rice flocked to it in droves. Before the subsidized sales even began, the entrances of each subsidized sales point were crowded with people, a pitiful sight. These people, wearing thin clothes to ward off the cold, stood waiting by the roadside, waiting for the start of the rice sales. The various forms and colors were a rare and tragic sight. Most of these people were from the working class, dressed in rags and with haggard faces, reflecting the general state of starvation under the high cost of rice and firewood. However, although they were penniless, they understood the principles and maintained order in all places, without a sound. Yesterday, on the first day of rice sales, no less than 30,000 people bought rice. In less than three hours, the subsidized sales at each location were completely sold out. Today, on the second day, all procedures were completed last night.</p>
<p>Secret Investigation of Rice Stocks</p>
<p>At a time when there are continuous rumors of abundant stocks, some speculative rice weevils still find it difficult to change their ways, losing their minds, hoarding goods, and endangering public safety. Their crime is unforgivable. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in the city that the authorities of the two concessions were determined to deal with the rice vermin according to the law. They have already sent investigators to be responsible for secretly investigating the grain stocks in various rice warehouses and the names of hoarders in the city. Anyone who has been hoarding for a long time and is unwilling to easily sell will be arrested and sent to court for punishment once the investigation is verified. It is said that they will be prosecuted for the crime of endangering social security. At the same time, all their hoarded rice, regardless of quantity, will be confiscated and used for subsidized sales. According to another source, the relevant authorities in the city will register the rice stocks in the warehouses, including (1) the date of entry into the warehouse, (2) the origin and purchase price, and the name of the owner. At the same time, it was decided to limit the warehousing period. Once the deadline is reached, all goods must be removed from the warehouse. At that time, a legitimate profit can be given to sell on the spot. The English-language "North China Daily News" also stated that the general public believes that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession are now "quietly" investigating private rice stocks in the city's warehouses in order to deal with them. Although officials from the two concessions did not deny or confirm this, some sources said that the authorities had already taken this step. If a thorough investigation can be carried out, the food situation may improve soon. Yesterday, after the two rice vermin, Zhang Junlong and Tan Minde, were detained and sentenced by the court to ten months of imprisonment and fifteen days of detention for violating price controls, the general speculative rice weevils and non-professional merchants were shocked, and transactions were unusually stagnant, with little activity on both sides.</p>
<p>Noodle Prices Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, with the agreement of Deputy General Manager He of the Shanghai Municipal Council, allowed the Fuxin and Fufeng factories to resume supplying half the amount of subsidized flour, totaling 2,030 bags for 376 companies over two days. The cost of subsidized flour increased to 21.5 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 0.3 yuan. However, the selling price of noodles was allowed to increase to 0.46 yuan per catty, sold at the listed price and not exceeding the prescribed price. However, wholesale noodle prices are not subject to this restriction due to cost factors. Regarding the 126 companies registered in the border area, they have been asking the association to supply subsidized flour. The association sent representatives to Deputy General Manager He of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday to request it. He agreed to increase the supply after the flour mills have sufficient raw materials, but for now, the distribution will be based on the previously determined number of companies.</p>

<h3>Bond Market Soars, Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens; Value of Legal Tender Rises; New Subsidiary Currency of Central Bank Already Shipped to Shanghai; Floating Capital Moves Inward, Financial Institutions Stabilize</h3>
<p>After the US loan to China of 100 million US dollars and the British loan to China of 10 million pounds were successively established, half of each was used to stabilize the Chinese monetary system. Regarding the stabilization methods and application methods, Song Ziwen has agreed with the British and American authorities. The Chinese government has solemnly declared its determination to maintain the monetary system and creditworthiness, to stabilize foreign exchange with all its strength, and to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate to protect the trade of friendly countries with China. As a result, the foundation of Chinese legal tender has become more solid, the official exchange rate has remained stable, the black market exchange rate has loosened, the value of legal tender has increased, and the prices of various postwar bonds in overseas markets have soared and are difficult to obtain. The domestic bond market has exceeded the wartime statutory price limit, stabilizing the national financial situation, benefiting Chinese and foreign merchants, and greatly improving the prospects for resistance and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Bond Market Soars, Chinese and Foreigners Compete to Buy</p>
<p>Prices in the overseas market for Chinese government bonds have repeatedly risen sharply, with British and American investors competing to buy Chinese government bonds. Postwar bonds have risen from £16 to £34, and Crisp bonds have risen from £12 to £26.5, and are still difficult to obtain. The domestic public bond market is surging because the government has decided not to suspend the payment of domestic debt secured by tariffs due to the seizure of tariff revenue in the war zone. The Central Bank was ordered to start discounting payments on January 31st for the tenth payment of principal and interest, which boosted morale and soaring prices. The Chinese people have been buying one after another, with Type A exceeding the government's listed statutory price limit of 76 yuan since August 13th. Moreover, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has decided to hold the eleventh lottery redemption on schedule from February.</p>
<p>Black Market Exchange Rate Stabilizes, Legal Tender Value Rises</p>
<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee was established in March of the previous year, it has made every effort to stabilize the statutory foreign exchange and maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate. More than 5 million pounds of the 10 million pound fund remain, and the rumor that it has been exhausted has been proven untrue by the facts. Now that the British and American loans to China have been successful, China's foreign exchange fund has increased by another 50 million US dollars and 5 million pounds, which is sufficient to maintain the statutory foreign exchange and make it last, stabilize the Shanghai black market exchange rate to maintain the desired level, and resist Japan's economic aggression against China. As a result, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has loosened, the black market price of legal tender has increased, and Chinese and foreign merchants have benefited greatly from trade. The scope of speculation has narrowed, and the once active black market has become quieter than before.</p>
<p>New Two-Cent Notes Shipped to Shanghai for Issuance</p>
<p>After the four major banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, adjusted the Shanghai legal tender and subsidiary currency as ordered by the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai market has been sufficient for circulation. The past shortage and panic have now been completely reduced. The Central Bank's newly printed two-cent notes are printed by the Zhonghua Book Company Limited. The front has the words "Two Cents" and the serial number on the left, and a portrait of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, on the right. The back has the words "Two Cents" in Arabic numerals printed in 1940. Both the front and back are in dark blue and lake green. It is said that the notes were shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by friendly banks and have already circulated in the market.</p>
<p>Uniform Rejection of Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<p>The areas of the sea concessions that have not been approved by the Ministry of Finance have uniformly refused to accept and use them because the industries deeply understand the righteousness. Therefore, the market has not yet discovered them. It is said that the trade associations of various industries have received samples of these miscellaneous notes, which are divided into one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, as well as one cent, five cents, two cents, and five cents. It is said that they are printed by Huacheng Company, and the portrait of the Premier is exactly the same as the legal tender. All industries have decided to reject these miscellaneous notes.</p>
<p>Capital Moves Inward, Institutions Strengthen</p>
<p>The national financial market has stabilized after the four major state banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and local financial institutions throughout the country jointly maintained it. The legitimate goods of various industries have entered the right track. The financial situation in isolated Shanghai is also the same. The capital that once flowed to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia has gradually returned to Shanghai and other parts of the country due to the uneasy situation in the Pacific. Shanghai has long been flooded with floating capital. After the banking and money industries found ways to solve the issue, the floating capital has been continuously moved into the mainland. Recently, remittances from Shanghai to the mainland have surged, because the government is encouraging the inward transfer of capital from the ports, exempting remittance fees and providing subsidies. For example, if more than 800 yuan is paid in Shanghai, 1,000 yuan will be fully received in Chongqing. As for remittances from the mainland to Shanghai, they will be strictly restricted, except for necessities such as purchasing goods, to prevent capital outflow.</p>
<h3>The United States is Doing its Best to Promote National Defense Production</h3>
<p>Unemployment Situation Greatly Eased</p>
<p>National Defense Projects in Honolulu are Accelerating</p>
<p>According to a report in Continental News, according to crew members of the President Pierce, which arrived in Shanghai on Sunday, the unemployment situation in the United States has greatly eased since the promotion of national defense production. Although accurate statistics and results have not yet been officially announced, the general workers believe that the current employment opportunities are much more than a year ago. Most of those who had no fixed jobs have obtained fixed positions, and the emerging peacetime industries are also keeping pace with wartime armaments production. A large number of workers are currently moving to Honolulu because national defense projects are being actively built there. All ships have been requisitioned.</p>
<h3>Defense of the Central District of the Public Concession; Merchant Corps Continues Guarding; No Incidents Occurred in Four Months; Other Defense Forces Have No Right to Enter the District</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a message yesterday to explain the importance of the Merchant Corps garrisoning District B, stating that since August of last year, the defense of District B of the Public Concession has been undertaken by the Municipal Council Merchant Corps to replace the British army. In other words, members of the Merchant Corps, sacrificing their spare time, have been serving the community by taking on the defense of District B for more than four months. The Corps has been trying to gradually reduce the number of garrisoned personnel to the minimum possible. However, in order to effectively control the district, it is currently not possible to reduce it further. Some employers believe that the number of personnel required in the district has been greatly reduced compared to the beginning, so the staff they employ should be relieved of their garrison duties. This attitude only increases the responsibility of other more enthusiastic employers and members.</p>
<p>Peaceful Defense Zone, Outstanding Achievements</p>
<p>The garrison of the Merchant Corps is equivalent to a defense force, providing moral and military assistance. If the Merchant Corps were not garrisoning the area, the defense would have to be undertaken by other defense forces. This type of work requires great perseverance and proper handling in order to be effective. Fortunately, since the Merchant Corps took over, no accidents have occurred, which is commendable. The area around District B is the defense zone of the defense forces of various countries and the French garrison. Their greatest task is to cooperate with each other and engage in the normal policing of Shanghai. Moreover, unless permitted by the Merchant Corps, other defense forces have no right to enter District B.</p>
<h3>Hua Yang Charity Association Promotes Winter Relief in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces; No Less Than Five or Six Hundred Thousand Extremely Poor Disaster Victims in the Two Provinces; Disaster Situation in Yixing is the Most Severe, Many Starving People in Shaoxing, Zhejiang; Charity Groups Prepare to Welcome Dr. Baker</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are rich in products, and the general people lived and worked in peace before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, the occupied areas have suffered severely, and the people's lives have been difficult. Even in non-occupied areas, military actions have directly and indirectly affected the area, causing prices to rise. Last year, some farmland suffered from severe drought, and harvests were reduced, leading to the lower and middle classes losing their livelihoods and crying out for food. It is estimated that there are no less than five or six hundred thousand extremely poor disaster victims in various places. As the north wind is blowing, how will these disaster victims solve the problem of freezing and starvation? This is a serious problem. In view of this, the local Hua Yang Charity Association and others are actively promoting winter relief work to provide relief. The disaster situation in various places is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Disaster Situation in Yixing is Unprecedentedly Tragic</p>
<p>Among the occupied areas, the disaster situation in Yixing is more severe. Last year, drought occurred, and the county's agriculture was not cultivated at all, or those who cultivated also had no harvest. There are more than 676,000 acres of disaster-stricken farmland in the county, and more than 297,000 disaster victims. Refugees are everywhere, and the situation is tragic and unprecedented. The Yixing Shanghai Native Place Association has raised 40,000 yuan, and the National Government has allocated 20,000 yuan from Chongqing and the Hua Yang Charity Association 5,000 yuan, totaling 65,000 yuan, which will be distributed by the Charity Association. The Yixing Shanghai Native Place Association will send another telegram to the National Government, requesting continued allocation of funds. Songjiang has also suffered, and the disaster situation is very serious. The church relief association jointly formed by Christianity and Catholicism has been carrying out relief work, distributing white rice three to five liters per person four times a month. However, due to its limited strength, it has been successively provided with funds from the Hua Yang Charity Association and others to expand winter relief.</p>
<p>The Disaster Situation is Severe in Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>In Shaoxing, Zhejiang, rice prices have been affected by military action, exceeding 130 yuan per picul, so the disaster is severe. According to local reports, more than 200 people die of starvation every day. Currently, Dr. Afute of the International Relief Committee has established four porridge factories in the county, and more than 5,000 disaster victims receive porridge every day. The Hua Yang Charity Association has allocated 10,000 yuan to help, and other funds have been collected from various sources. The situation in Zhuji and Ningbo is also worrying. The Hua Yang Charity Association and other charity groups have sent people to investigate and will also set up porridge factories to promote winter relief for those in urgent need of relief.</p>
<p>Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Announces Sustenance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association announced that since last year, when it successively provided funds and disbanded able-bodied refugees, it still provided accommodation to elderly and child refugees. By the end of the year, the association had accommodated 14,945 refugees. Due to soaring prices, the sustenance for each refugee had also risen to 11.1 yuan, so the monthly sustenance expenses still required 165,894.2 yuan. This huge expenditure has always been raised and donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life in the city. When the association was first established in November 1938, it accommodated 54,491 refugees, and the sustenance for each person per month was 1.9 yuan. The total monthly expenditure only needed 100,352.9 yuan. Comparing it with the end of last year, the difference is ten times. The sustenance standard price in November 1938 was 10 yuan per picul of rice, 28.85 yuan per ton of coal, 0.09 yuan per pound of salt, and 0.2 yuan per pound of oil. By the end of last year, the price of rice had increased to 70 yuan per picul, coal to 107.5 yuan per ton, salt to 0.18 yuan per pound, and oil to 0.8 yuan per pound. Therefore, when it was first established, the number of refugees accommodated was large, but the sustenance expenses were small. Now, the number of people in foster care has decreased by nearly four times, but the sustenance expenses have increased, making it difficult to maintain. Yesterday, the association published a notice to all sectors of society, listing the monthly number of people accommodated and sustenance statistics for the two years from November 1938 to December 1940, so that people in society could understand everything.</p>
<p>Baker Arrives in Shanghai, Preparations for Welcome</p>
<p>After Dr. Baker, director of the American Red Cross China Relief Department and executive director of the Hua Yang Charity Association, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th, more than ten charity groups, including the local Refugee Relief Association, the Charity Federation, the Jisheng Association, the Hua Yang Charity Association, and the Salvation Army, prepared to hold a welcome meeting, thanking Baker for his publicity in the United States, raising 50 million yuan in funds, and visiting the inland provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hunan to inspect refugee relief work. The date and location are currently under discussion, but it will not be more than a week.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry is Praised by the Authorities for Selling Rice at Subsidized Prices</p>
<p>The local New Pharmaceutical Industry Association has been selling white rice at subsidized prices in the two concessions since November 5th of last year. The public concession rice selling point is at 730 Wenjianshi Road, Qianye Guild Hall, and the French concession is at 99 Zhiyuan Fahui, 78 Lane, Du Shenfu Road. Each place sells 6,000 catties of hot rice every day, 0.2 yuan per catty, and each person is limited to one catty at a time. Since the start of the program, a total of more than 90,000 yuan has been sacrificed. Their enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the poor is admirable. The Shanghai Municipal Council expressed its admiration for this. It is said that the subsidized sale of white rice will continue. As for the distribution of steamed buns by the charity group, the amount of flour has been increased to 50 bags. Xu Shiying's daughter, chairman of the Zhen Association, personally went to visit and distribute the buns yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Success Story of Reuters</h3>
<p>Film Made, to be Shown Tomorrow</p>
<p>The importance of the news industry has been deeply understood by countries around the world. The speed of news transmission today is so fast that international situations can be transmitted to all parts of the world in half a minute. Compared to the days when news was transmitted by carriages, the speed of progress cannot be measured in miles. When we read the newspaper, we often find the word "Reuters" at the beginning and end of the news. Who is Reuters? He is the first person to create the news industry. The news industry has come to this day because of Reuters alone. A century ago, Reuters worked in a bank, copying market quotations every day. After leaving his job, he set up his own pigeon station, which could transmit the market quotations of the day to the East in a few hours, much faster than other information. Reuters then used pigeons to transmit news, first with Paris as the station, and later moved to London due to changes in the political situation. He set up a small room as an office, specializing in the transmission of commercial news. People in society gradually knew of Reuters. Reuters then set up branch offices in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. After his hard work, he founded The Times. At that time, the situation between France and Austria was deteriorating, and people around the world were eager to hear the French king's speech first. Reuters then visited the French king, and the French king's speech was transmitted to London from the telegram in half an hour. The people in Paris were able to read the full text of the speech a few hours later. Reuters's position was thus consolidated, his reputation was enhanced, and the news industry flourished and reached today. Reuters's success is due to his spirit of perseverance and unyieldingness. Reuters's career has reached a point of great importance. Reuters's life story has become a model for people in all walks of life to know. From the 9th of this month, the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city will show the Warner Bros. film "Reuters", starring actor Edward G. Robinson, which is a must-see blockbuster. We will give advance notice to fulfill our reporting responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club's Regular Meeting This Week</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week will be held on the original date (Thursday), January 9th, at noon at the Capital Hotel. At that time, Mr. Wong, a member of the society and an employee of the Duff Trading Company, will give a lecture on the topic of "Soybeans". Out-of-town members are welcome to attend, and it is hoped that they will notify the society's secretary by telephone (16450) in advance to reserve a seat.</p>
<h3>The So-Called Yarn and Flower Market is Not Permitted by Law; Will Open Immediately After the General Settlement</h3>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange was ordered to stop auctioning after August 13th, and has not been restored due to the special environment. As for the dark market for yarn in Shanghai, it is also an illegal organization. Due to the manipulation of speculators, prices have soared and plummeted, becoming the only paradise for speculators, similar to the so-called gold dark market. Recently, someone organized the so-called yarn and flower market, which was originally intended to borrow the old site of the Adowa Road Yarn and Cloth Exchange, but was rejected by the authorities of the exchange. It is said that a certain house has been selected and will be repaired and arranged, and it is planned to open for trading after the general settlement. It is actually a disguised yarn and cloth exchange. According to the Exchange Law, a similar exchange cannot be set up in the same area, so the establishment of the market is not permitted by Chinese law. Now, due to the poor environment in Shanghai, it was established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economics, which is slightly similar to the Japanese-run Cotton Industry Exchange. Regarding the Council of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, they do not want to express any opinion on this so-called yarn and flower market.</p>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>The local White Russian Immigrant Committee recently established a White Russian Beggar Shelter on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, which has accommodated 25 White Russian beggars. It is also planning to set up another one in the French Concession, but it has not yet been established because a house has not been found.</p>
<p>According to reliable information from the shipping industry, smuggling is rampant in Mao Island, Sanmen Bay (belonging to Ninghai County). The Ninghai County Government ordered the police to seize 20,000 red pills at Yang Xianmou's house. The county government ordered that Yang Xianmou be arrested and brought to justice, and sent personnel to seal off all his property together with the township security chief.</p>
<p>The post office announced that in the future, for parcels and small packages of goods sent to Shantou, it is not necessary to submit the permits issued by the appropriate local authorities when mailing. However, when delivering, the permit must still be presented.</p>
<h3>Briton Shot and Killed in Bailinan Road Post Office; Tried to Capture Thief Robbing Russian Woman; Shot Once, Seriously Wounded, Died</h3>
<p>Latham, a British employee of the British-owned Public Welfare Yarn Factory, was 36 years old and lived at 129 Jixifeier Road. Yesterday at 1:20 PM, he went to the Bailinan Road Post Office to mail a letter. At the same time, a Russian woman was also mailing a letter at the post office. At that time, three armed bandits suddenly came. One person guarded the gate of the post office, and the other two went inside, pointed a gun at the Russian woman, and robbed her of the diamond ring and wallet on her hand. Seeing this, Latham disregarded his own safety, stepped forward and knocked down one of the bandits, and snatched the gun. He was about to deal with the remaining bandits, but unexpectedly, another bandit shot him in the back. Latham was shot, the bullet passed through his right lung and came out of his chest. He fell to the ground and repeatedly called for someone to call the police. At that time, the staff in the post office were all stunned and dumbfounded. After the bandits left, they called the Jing'an Temple Road Patrol Room and sent a group of detectives to the scene. At the same time, the Japanese military police also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. They first took Latham to the Hongen Hospital for treatment, but he soon died because the bullet hit a vital spot. At that time, the detectives searched for the bandits around the post office, but found nothing. Mrs. Latham fainted on the spot after hearing the news. After the family's emergency treatment, she was still unable to get out of bed, so Latham's funeral arrangements will have to wait until his wife recovers.</p>

<h3>Nephew Conspires with Accomplices to Steal Aunt's Jewelry: Confession Details Drug-Induced Stupor; Key Suspect Still at Large, Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>A woman named Zhou Shuangmei, who makes a living selling jewelry, was widowed early in life. She lived with her husband's sister, Zhou Afu, on the upper floor of a building at 51 Hart Road. On the evening of the 5th of this month, at around 9 p.m., a handbag belonging to Zhou Shuangmei, containing three large and small diamond rings, one jade ring, 450 pearls, 200 old lustrous pearls, two pearl bracelets and one dragon bracelet, worth 40,000 yuan, was suddenly stolen from her residence. She immediately reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Under the direction of Chinese Detective Yao Yuanlong and Detectives Ni Jiafeng and Zhang Youming, along with Western Detective Greenfell, an investigation was launched, and the</p>
<p>Case Suspects Apprehended</p>
<p>Two individuals, Zhou Muquan from Suzhou and Wang Guoyu from Shanghai, were apprehended. A jade ring and twelve individual diamonds were found on Wang. A diamond ring worth 5,000 yuan was also retrieved from the Tongchang Pawnshop at 274 Avenue Edward VII and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Zhang Tianyin charged them with robbery, stating that the defendant Zhou Muquan is Zhou Shuangmei's nephew and resides in the front building at number 51. Some time ago, Zhou Muquan met his friends Xie Jinliang and Wang Guoyu at the Jindu Dance Hall. Finding himself</p>
<p>Short on Funds</p>
<p>As the end of the year approached, Zhou suggested robbing his aunt Zhou Shuangmei's jewelry. They discussed the plan in a room at the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road and decided to proceed with the robbery. Xie was tasked with obtaining a sedative pill and instructed Zhou to return home and put it in the tea to make her dizzy. They set the date for the evening of January 5th. When Zhou Shuangmei had not returned from selling jewelry outside, Zhou Muquan mixed the pill into a lemon tea and asked Zhou Afu to drink it. This was around 6 p.m. However, Zhou Shuangmei happened to return home with the handbag and saw Afu drinking tea, unaware that the tea contained a drug. After a while, Zhou Muquan suddenly suggested</p>
<p>Playing Mahjong Together</p>
<p>Zhou Shuangmei, two tenants named Wang and Qin, and Muquan's father, Long Xing, formed a group in Muquan's room in the front building. Before long, the drug took effect, causing Zhou Afu, who was washing dishes on the balcony, to suddenly faint. She was helped into the room to lie down. At this time, Muquan left the door open, and Xie and Wang sneaked in, heading straight to the upper floor and stealing the handbag. In a daze, Zhou Afu vaguely saw someone enter the room and awoke. She tried to turn on the light, but the wires had been cut. Realizing something was wrong, she shouted loudly and discovered that the</p>
<p>Handbag Had Been Stolen</p>
<p>She reported the incident to the police station. After investigation by Chinese and Western detectives, the above situation was clarified, leading to the arrests. Xie is currently on the run, and some of the stolen goods have not yet been recovered. The prosecution requested a postponement. Zhou Shuangmei and Zhou Afu also complained that all the jewelry was brokered from the Leyuan Public Association on Second Malu, requesting a thorough investigation. When questioned, Zhou Muquan and Wang Guoyu confessed to the accusations, but claimed that all the jewelry was taken by Xie, and they received nothing. Judge Zhong reviewed the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained for a continued hearing on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Zhou Meiquan Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Lucky to Have Seen the Danger Early and Pressed the Alarm; Detectives Arrived, but the Bandits Had Already Fled</p>
<p>Zhou Meiquan, a 62-year-old Anhui native residing at 475 Route Lafargue in the French Concession, was formerly the Governor-General of Liangjiang during the Qing Dynasty. He lives in Shanghai as a retired official and owns a private car with license plate number 11780. Yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m., Zhou intended to go out. As the driver was pulling the car out of the garage, four kidnappers wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, two of whom were armed with guns, were seen lurking near the garage. As Zhou stepped out of the iron gate, he caught sight of the four men and, realizing they were not good people, immediately turned back and instructed the driver to close the iron gate. He then pressed the alarm bell to call for help from the police. By the time the police arrived, the bandits had already fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Theft Reports</h3>
<p>A Japanese employee named Aizawa Kiyoshi, number 846 of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, was on his way home to Hongkou from the police station at around 10:15 p.m. on the 3rd. While walking east along Jing'an Temple Road, he reached the corner of Xiaoshazhe Road and was suddenly confronted by three people. Two of them, armed with handguns, forced him to take off his raincoat and stole eight yuan in Japanese military currency and 127 yuan in legal tender before fleeing.</p>
<p>At 418 Hart Road in West Shanghai, two bandits broke in yesterday morning at around 6 a.m. One was armed with a handgun, and the other held a small knife. They threatened the residents into silence and stole 1,578.60 yuan in national currency before fleeing.</p>
<h3>Daxin Textile Factory Relocates to New Address</h3>
<p>The various cotton and wool products produced by the Daxin Textile Factory in Shanghai are known for their novel designs and exquisite craftsmanship, and are sold in North and South America and the South Pacific Islands, earning widespread praise. Due to the inadequacy of the old factory site on Haining Road, the factory relocated to its new address at 81-3, Lane 159, Tokyo Road on January 1st. It is reported that the factory recently imported several new types of machinery from the United States, which have been installed and put into production. Both the techniques and designs are striving for modernization and are expected to become popular worldwide.</p>

<h3>"Private"</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>When the word "private" is mentioned, everyone seems to have an air of "top secret"...</p>
<p>In the past, everything had to be done in secret. Any "public" display could be life-threatening. That's why things like: treacherous officials torturing loyal subjects in secret; young ladies making secret engagements in the back gardens... and other such "private tricks" happened! But, "if you don't want others to know, don't do it in the first place." The magic lantern show will eventually be exposed, and then: the treacherous officials are executed; the young ladies hang themselves!</p>
<p>Now, supposedly the times have "progressed," so those kinds of things don't need to be done "privately" anymore. Traitorous officials can freely oppress loyal subjects without anyone daring to utter a peep; young ladies can choose their own husbands by simply announcing "I love him," and everything is resolved. Anyway, if things don't work out, they can just hire a lawyer, go to court, and get a divorce to end it all!</p>
<p>So, does that mean everything is out in the open now? No, no! As the saying goes, "It's always been this way, and now it's even worse!" The "private" sphere now surpasses what it was before.</p>
<p>Someone hoarding hundreds of dan of rice in their warehouse still complains that the price of rice is "unusually" high; a son doing something shady outside is "hush-hush" even in front of his own mother; and there are even more "clever people" who constantly complain about being poor while secretly grabbing everything they can get their hands on, like maggots in a latrine! These are all 100% "private" matters: and they appear "mysterious" and "profound"... not to be revealed to outsiders.</p>
<p>However, since the causes are the same, the consequences are generally the same as well. Once the mask is removed, and the "private affairs" are exposed, there are only two possible outcomes: execution! Suicide!</p>
<h3>Beyond the Dinner Party</h3>
<p>— Zuo Hui</p>
<p>How is the New Year celebrated? The newspapers are full of "Happy New Year" greetings and famous quotes; step outside, and the walls, corners, telephone poles, and mailboxes are covered with red strips replacing "bring me wealth" with slogans like "expel wolves, welcome victory."</p>
<p>Big companies and stores are all closed for the holidays. Managers, directors, and chiefs are all busy attending dinner parties. Plans are made in advance, so even before New Year's Day, the rooms have already been booked. No need to worry about the cost of the rooms either. There are plenty of people coming to play mahjong, and the commission from the games, besides covering the table fees, can also cover the cost of food, dishes, and fruit. The official date of the dinner party is New Year's Day, and the fee is 30 yuan per person. There are 11 people, so the total is 330 yuan. It seems more than enough to have a dinner party with that amount, so no wonder everyone calls the purchasing department director a "miser" behind his back. He sticks out his tongue and asks the person in charge, "Old Wu, how much is a table of dishes?"</p>
<p>"I think it will cost at most 100 silver dollars."</p>
<p>"Then what will we do with the rest?"</p>
<p>"What will we do with the rest? There are plenty of other things to spend it on."</p>
<p>The purchasing department director rolled his eyes and wanted to ask more, but then he heard Mr. Huang's voice, "Broken nine, two, three concealed kong!" "Pair pair win," three fan! Hot, right! Old Wu heard that it was Mr. Huang's voice. He and Mr. Huang were in a 40/60 partnership, which made him so happy that he couldn't stop smiling. He rushed over, leaving the purchasing department director alone.</p>
<p>"How can he be the director of the purchasing department? He's just a yokel!" Old Wu thought to himself. "330 yuan, what's enough to spend? Maybe he thought I was going to skim some off the top."</p>
<p>The purchasing department director really couldn't handle the "big scene." He couldn't smoke, couldn't play dominoes, and got nervous when he saw money. He had no choice but to lie on the sofa, grumbling to himself, "Dinner party? Is this really a dinner party? It's just gambling." His stomach started rumbling, but Old Wu shouted, "Let's finish four rounds before eating." So, the slapping sound of the mahjong tiles continued.</p>
<p>At 7:30, Director Ji woke up from a nap on the sofa. The dishes had been laid out, and everyone started eating. Director Ji could be said to be the only one who really came for the dinner party. He ate with great enthusiasm. Some of them seemed to have ulterior motives, secretly discussing something and passing things back and forth; finally, they passed them to the purchasing department director. He looked at them with a mouthful of beef and saw that the paper was full of pictures of girls, "Beauties"!</p>
<p>"Mr. Ji, which one do you like?" Mr. Huang asked seriously, and everyone's eyes were glued to Director Ji's face.</p>
<p>"We're here for a dinner party, let's not have a 'beauty party'," Director Ji said with a smile, as if mocking everyone. "I'm leaving after I finish eating."</p>
<p>Old Wu stood by the telephone and said, "Okay, then three?"</p>
<p>"Okay, three."</p>
<p>So, Old Wu dialed the phone.</p>
<p>The dinner party ended, and the sound of dominoes continued. The purchasing department director said goodbye, and Old Wu saw him off. Just as Director Ji stepped out of the room, three girls arrived. He took a step back to let them in first, then with a hot face, savoring the taste of the beef, Director Ji left. In the room, the lewd laughter of men and women rang out.</p>
<p>"Thirty yuan per person, it turns out there's more than just a dinner party," the purchasing department director seemed to understand something in the elevator.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Even now, six or seven days later, Wang Yuqin still regrets having taken that extra look that day. It's not that the person looked as ugly as Zhang Fei or Dou Erdun, giving him nightmares after seeing him. Nor is it that the person looked as handsome as Zhou Yu or Zhang Junrui, making him unable to stop thinking about him when he got back. In reality, this person had a very ordinary face, just a bit fatter than most people. Yuqin didn't find this face particularly strange. What frightened him most was the pair of eyes on that face, a pair of eyes that were round, large, sharp, and cruel, fully containing a kind of barely restrained bestiality.</p>
<p>When Yuqin looked back, his eyes met those four eyes exactly, making him panic and unable to avoid them.</p>
<p>"Good!" Those sitting on either side of this person immediately shouted "Good!" in a very accommodating manner. Then, a series of strange owl-like laughter told him that the fat man was gloating with self-satisfaction!</p>
<p>As a result, Yuqin's performance was greatly affected. He felt that that pair of bestial eyes was constantly fixed on him, never leaving, forcing him to want to run backstage immediately, take off his female costume, and restore his original appearance. Later, he almost forgot his lines. Fortunately, the applause from the audience was like his predetermined windfall, rising for no reason, allowing him to enter the backstage without receiving the scolding he had expected.</p>
<p>"Singing the role of a female lead is not for human beings!" he said angrily, rushing to pull off his headdress.</p>
<p>"As long as you can make up your own mind, what's there to be afraid of?" His second brother, Yu Kun, dressed as Zhu Guangzu, holding a single-edged sword, stood behind him watching him take off his makeup, encouraging him in a very crisp manner, while continuously spewing out a wujiapi aroma. Without asking, one knew that he had secretly bought wine with the pocket money he had earned tonight.</p>
<p>Yuqin had nothing to say. He had no choice but to throw the clothes he had taken off, in a fit of pique, over to the clothing trunk. (Three)</p>
<h3>Words on Cultivation (5)</h3>
<p>If you believe that one task is worthless and are unwilling to do it, and another task is also worthless and you are unwilling to do it, I ask you, what task are you willing to do? Have you sufficiently prepared yourself with knowledge, abilities, and experience to take on important tasks? If not, I urge you to start with small tasks and treat work as a form of learning.</p>
<h3>Snake Talk in the Year of the Snake</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zimang</p>
<p>In the display windows of city companies, you can see beautiful snake-patterned ties; in museums, you can see real snakeskins immersed in pale yellow alcohol in glass tubes. The patterns are fine and patterned. Of course, those snake-patterned ties pale in comparison. However, I think the snakeskins displayed in museums are nothing more than beautiful shells. If it were truly a living snake writhing in the wild, it would be even more temptingly beautiful to think about.</p>
<p>In mythology, the snake is a tempter: Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and caused eternal regret, which was also said to be due to the temptation of the snake! Snakes trick people, and they do it unconsciously. This is a cunning animal. Even its counterpart, the centipede, has a fierce-looking red head and countless pincer-like claws, which make people feel a little fear and caution. As for the snake, there are even imitation snakeskin ties sold in the world, worn between men's snow-white stiff collars and perfumed suits. It is clear that people have long been seduced by the beauty of snakes.</p>
<p>However, the snake is a bad thing. It is greedy, it is vicious, and it uses beauty and temptation to cover up its brutality. It will devour people and spread venom. Therefore, when traveling, you must carry a cane to hit the snake. As for the method of hitting, you must be quick-eyed and quick-handed, with strength in your hands. It is best to hit it head-on; if you hit it on the body, it will slip away. Its escape route is winding and tortuous, so when the snake escapes and disappears in an instant, you must immediately look for it along the winding path. It will definitely make the snake be "subjected to torture."</p>
<p>Hit it if you see it. Even if there is no snake, you have to beware of snakes. Although "drawing a snake in a cup" describes a state of suspicion, we must always have this suspicion in our current lives. - Especially since it's not a "snake shadow" shaking, right?</p>
<p>"Snake talk in the Year of the Snake" is indeed a "cultured person's" timely topic, citing the ancient to prove the present, discussing poetry and literature. However, somehow, because of the snake, I often think of a certain type of person in society, which makes people think even more of the fable of the snake swallowing the elephant - the snake swallows the elephant's nose, and then greedily swallows the elephant, until with a snap, the narrow snake body bursts...</p>
<h3>"Rice Pearl Lament" — A Lament for Shanghai's Starving Corpses and a Warning to the Newly Rich Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>— Yang Yunshi</p>
<p>The world is poor, suddenly many rich.</p>
<p>A dou of rice costs one hundred thousand cash,</p>
<p>Those who obtain it are not my farmers.</p>
<p>A chi of silk is an average person's wealth,</p>
<p>Those who obtain it are not my workers.</p>
<p>Copper mountains enter private chambers,</p>
<p>Starving corpses are like flying weeds!</p>
<p>Southeast's years are bountiful,</p>
<p>Year after year, harvests are abundant.</p>
<p>Transport ships fill the rivers and lakes,</p>
<p>Why are they hidden empty?</p>
<p>Inland, grains are hurt by cheapness,</p>
<p>Stopping sales exhausts all goods.</p>
<p>They collude to monopolize,</p>
<p>Cutting off the work of ships.</p>
<p>Rich oils flow eastward to the sea,</p>
<p>Ten thousand ships rush to supply it.</p>
<p>A meager, chaotic remainder,</p>
<p>Like precious pearls and rare goods.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands every morning and evening,</p>
<p>Claiming to be Tao Zhugong.</p>
<p>Food is the people's heaven,</p>
<p>How much more in times of war.</p>
<p>At this time, warmth and fullness are difficult,</p>
<p>A hundred li are filled with lamentations.</p>
<p>In the morning, hunger screams at the wife,</p>
<p>In the evening, she sells a child.</p>
<p>Alas, my children,</p>
<p>How can we continue to eat!</p>
<p>Gold fights white bones,</p>
<p>Rice determines the victorious and the defeated.</p>
<p>Quiet nights have no sound to lose,</p>
<p>Intermittent rain mixes with wind.</p>
<p>The few grow fat on the leanness of the masses,</p>
<p>Little ones beat drums and attack.</p>
<p>Cao Zhi rushed too quickly to the front,</p>
<p>Beans weep in the pot!</p>
<p>Greed is an inauspicious thing,</p>
<p>Monsters gather in the morning mist.</p>
<p>It is fitting to throw them to tigers and wolves,</p>
<p>Five punishments are not allowed to be used.</p>
<p>Killing one person results in death,</p>
<p>The law punishes its wickedness.</p>
<p>Daily slaughtering ten thousand without bloodshed,</p>
<p>Slaughterous aura fills the sky at the riverhead.</p>
<p>Alas, Buddha says hell is full,</p>
<p>Heaven sees and heaven hears clearly and wisely,</p>
<p>Hungry ghosts and evil paths are filled with Deng Tong.</p>

<h3>Talking About "Spinning Cotton"</h3>
<p>— Li Yunying</p>
<p>Recently, in the opera world, the play "Spinning Cotton" has unexpectedly become so popular. Currently, there are two female performers who can sing it well: 1. Wu Suqiu; 2. Tong Zhiling. They have been performing it consecutively at the Golden Sun Theater for many times. The box office results have already been seen by the audience, so I don't need to elaborate further.</p>
<p>However, in recent performances of "Spinning Cotton," only the scene in the middle where Zhang San "returns home and teases" is performed. In fact, there are many other scenes before and after, such as Zhang San wooing his wife, going out to trade, Zhang's wife having an affair, returning home and teasing, revealing the affair, the lover plotting to murder her husband, the case breaking out, a trial in court, and both being executed. The whole play takes more than three hours to perform, similar to Xiao Cuihua's "Double Nail Record" and "Ma Siyuan." It is listed as one of the Eight Great Plays of the Qing Dynasty, and it was a very famous play in its time.</p>
<p>I still remember the heyday of "Spinning Cotton" was around 1921. It was really popular all over Beijing and Shanghai. At that time, it was Thirteenth Dan (i.e., Liu Yirong, not Hou Junxian) and En Xiaofeng (a male actor playing a female comic role) who often performed it at the Guangdelou Theater in the old capital. Later, female Dan Zhang Wenyan also sang it extensively in the south, and they all became very popular. However, there was another female Dan who became popular later in Beijing, called Bi Yunxia. A certain refined person (I can't remember the name) even changed the name of the play for her to "Reeling Silk Maiden." In addition, there was also Little Ma Wu, who was very popular in the Shanghai area for a while, and often performed with plays like "Wei Garlic." After 1928, due to the Northern Expedition Revolution, the authorities ordered a ban on such plays, so they were neglected for almost ten years. Who knew that after the war, in the isolated island and the occupied old capital, they would suddenly become popular and revitalized!</p>

<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>After Liu Rushi recovered her health, she no longer cared about what Mu Zhai was doing outside. She sat quietly in her room every day, studying Buddhism. She was too lazy to write poetry, and had neglected her inkstone. She no longer had the clear and elegant mood to sing and beat the earthen drum while leaning on the balcony. The boring years passed quickly. At this time, Jiangnan was full of compliant subjects. The flags of the former dynasty were nowhere to be seen, and the nobles of the new dynasty flaunted their power. Yushan County had long surrendered to the embrace of the Aisin Gioro clan. The bloody battle of Jiangyin and the massacre of Jiading had just passed. Mu Zhai's ambition had already been shaken, and he was inevitably surrounded by villains, who joined them in becoming their accomplices, not hesitating to kneel and serve the Qing Dynasty. Mu Zhai accepted an official position from the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Although he was still listed as a Shangshu, the Qing court was only implementing a policy of appeasement and did not attach much importance to him. Because he was ultimately a literati and did not have any meritorious political achievements, he was not as favored as other hawks and hounds, and he often asked for leave to stay at home. Liu Rushi wrote in the air, lamenting helplessly. After all, she was a weak woman, how could she resist this surging tide? One day, Mu Zhai went to Nanjing, and she sat alone upstairs, very bored. She happened to pick up a collection of poems by Yu Zishan and recited several of them, and thoughts of the former kingdom surged again. Suddenly, she saw a servant girl report that a large man had come outside, wanting to see Madame Liu, claiming to have important matters to discuss in person. Liu Rushi did not know who he was and was afraid that he was a villain, so she said to the servant girl, "The master is not at home. He is a guest from afar, what does he want to see me for? Why did you report so easily? You can go and say that I am not feeling well and cannot see him." The servant girl nodded and left. After a while, she ran upstairs again, her face flushed, and reported, "This servant followed Madame Liu's orders and replied to him accordingly, but the large man insisted on seeing Madame Liu. He is relying on not leaving, and said that if she doesn't report, he will break into the boudoir himself. His expression is very rude, so I have come again to ask for Madame Liu's instructions." Liu Rushi frowned: "Is there really such an unwelcome guest here? Why don't you ask for his name?" (29)</p>
<h3>The Outlook on Life Through Struggle</h3>
<p>— (Three)</p>
<p>The journey of life is like a high mountain. After climbing over one peak, you gain a piece of flat land. Climbing over another peak, there is another scene. After climbing all the way, you reach the highest peak, gazing into the distance and taking everything into your eyes. Looking down, the peaks are lined up at your feet, so a life of struggle is the most meaningful.</p>
<h3>Jiashe Rehearsal</h3>
<p>The Jiashe Opera Troupe is organized by the colleagues of the Daxingsheng Restaurant on Simalu. It is now scheduled to hold its founding anniversary and first rehearsal on the evening of the 9th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. The plays to be rehearsed include: Tu Yunfu's "Nanyang Pass," Chen Liru, Wang Fenglin, and Xia Zhensheng's collaboration on "Farewell," Lu Subo and Lv Zhanghai's "One Night as Empress," Zhu Rougang and Yu Zongding's "Precious Lotus Lantern," Luo Jianjing and Liu Meibo's "Teaching the Son," Zhang Xunliang and Xin Shoumin's "Worshipping the Mountain," Zhu Maoxing's "Escorting the Prisoner," and Zong Qihou, Wang Houfang, Chen Fuli, Zhu Yimin, Tu Chuanyi, Feng Jialiang, and Cui Wenchang's collaboration on the grand finale, "Silang Visits His Mother," approved by Tongling. The scene will be lively and bustling, and there will surely be a great spectacle on Yu Qiaqing Road.</p>

<h3>Yao Ke Directs "Wedding March"</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>In Shanghai's theater scene, in addition to a shortage of scripts, there is also a shortage of directing talent. However, in recent years, the position of theater itself has gradually improved, and it has been given more attention. For example, Zhang Junxiang, Zuo Lin, and Yao Ke specifically went overseas to study theater, which had never been seen before. Of course, it is not because they have been gilded that they will be different at all. It is also a fact that they can bring back a little more new things from overseas. For example, Zuo Lin's direction of "Small Town Story" and "The Liar," its novel techniques, opened up new avenues for future stage performances. Now, the new playwright Yao Ke, who has returned from the United States, has also resolutely stood up to work for the Shanghai theater scene. The drama club's opening play "Wedding March" will be directed by Yao Ke. "Wedding March" was written by the Soviet Kotayev, which Yao Ke, who has been to the Soviet Union and seen Soviet plays, can easily handle and achieve great success. Obviously, the emergence of specialized talents like Yao Ke will lay a more solid foundation for the Shanghai theater scene.</p>
<p>Twenty Kinds of Shaoxing Opera</p>
<h3>(19) Meng Lijing Observes the Portrait</h3>
<p>Meng Lijing disguised herself as a man under the name Li Mingtang. She excelled in the imperial examinations and eventually rose to the highest ranks of the court. Her family believed she had drowned herself in the Kunming River, and even her fiancé, Huangfu Shaohua, mourned her death, lamenting that they never became husband and wife.</p>
<p>Later, Huangfu Shaohua passed the autumn imperial examinations. In name, Li Mingtang was still his "benefactor." Although he had doubts, he dared not expose her identity rashly. Finally, he used the opportunity of observing a portrait – Meng Lijing's self-portrait – to subtly reveal the truth of the matter. (See illustration)</p>
<h3>(20) Strolling in the Shanglin Garden</h3>
<p>"Shanglin Garden" can be understood in common terms as the "Imperial Garden." Emperor Chengzong had long seen through Li Mingtang's gender, but he was unwilling to expose her secret; the reason being that this "romantic emperor" harbored a desire for Meng Lijing.</p>
<p>In the third month of late spring, Emperor Chengzong strolled in the Shanglin Garden, traveling with a small entourage, but he specifically requested "Minister Li to escort him." He attempted to entice her with playful words, but Meng Lijing valued "love above all else" and remained unmoved.</p>
<p>Such a spirit, that of "wealth and status cannot sway her heart, foreign houses and cars cannot shake her steadfastness," is difficult, alas, to find among the so-called modern daughters of today!</p>
