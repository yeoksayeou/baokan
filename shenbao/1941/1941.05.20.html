<h3>關於蘇聯所傳美日協定　中國政府發表聲明　日軍未撤離中國境內以前　必繼續作戰絕無和平可言</h3>
<p>重慶　此間最高權威方面本日再决聲明、在日軍未完全撤離中國及滿洲之前、中國決不討論和平、並謂日本之冀圖誘令美國出而調解中日戰事、乃係一種宜傳、以混淆國際觀聽、而延阻美國對華援助云、中國權威方面指出日軍之撤退、乃係中國人所共曉之一定原則、而並非談判之根據云、權威方面力言、直至目前爲止、日方並無絲毫誠意、以此項根據締結和平、因此日方此决宣傳、殊外國政府、絕不致爲此種日方宜傳所惑、權威方面力言、日方之宣傳、在於美國政府加緊在物質上及技術上援華時提出、並謂日方之消息、係試探性質、欲以測騐美國在太平洋對華軍事合作之準備、政治觀察家指出、照莫斯科報紙所載之日方調停條件、本身即自相矛盾、蓋日軍如果撤退、則如何能在中國維持其主要之地位、政治觀察家對於蘇報之以顯著地位登載調停之消息、甚爲注意、但中外人士方面懷疑美國是吾將依照蘇報所載之條件、而冀圖調停、彼等指出、此種條件、與著名之藍辛石井協定、極爲相類、該協定曾使美國之遠東政策、感受多年之嚴事困難、中國方面對於美國烏台州民主參議員湯姆斯所提出之調停之議、不欲加以評論、湯姆期主張組織中日變方所同意之美國委昌會、逐漸調停、中國軍界方面表示、在此租平謠言聲中、日軍在四處主要戰綫兩處决要戰綫進攻、乃欲使外國政府及在聊綫作戰之中國軍隊混惑云、（十九日合衆電）</p>
<h3>美政界對調解戰爭認為出於日方試探</h3>
<p>華盛頓　此間政府界昨日認爲英斯科所載日本建議美國調停中日戰爭之事、實係「試探汽球」、官方多數不肯加以評論、消息靈通界則稱、此項消息、原刊載於紐的報紙、但係山東京發出此舉、殆表示半官方面洩滬日人之願望、以試探中美兩國對此計劃之反應、官方是吾業已接到此項建議之事、旣不承認、亦不否認、惟消息靈通方面對當局是否業已接得建議之事、表示懷疑、政界領袖如鳥泰民主黨參議員湯姆斯基及其政府最有力之外交家兼遠東作家、則會個人予以批評、湯姆斯參議員合眾社記者云、調停之事、有值得考慮之價值、惟渠對「真理報」所載之消息、則斥為不合現實、湯氏云、許久以前、渠即敦促應以漸進的方法解決中日爭端、又稱、如能成立一爲中日變方所同意之美國調停委會、漸次謀解決此項問題、以現實為根據、可逐漸消除兩國間之意見、而恢復服遠東之均勢、湯姆斯又言、任何建議、凡事前不能使東京與重慶享有平等地位者、均必不能成功、渠又稱、日本承認蔣委員長之問題、不能成爲調停之目標、「美國決不可以中國之權益換取南太平洋之權益、中國無論在事實上或法律上、均係一完整之國家、日本願意南進與否、不能作為出賣中國權益之點、此兩點殆係截然不同之事、中國之權益已因該國資源更生而成立、任何調停均不得出賣此等權益、所可加以調停者、僅爲異見及糾紛、斷非獨在完整之基木權益也」、湯姆斯並建議從美聯會或拉丁美洲國家、將為此調停委會之一部份俾可擴大基礎、其他方面、小半對調停之事、表示冷淡、除非日本同一於事前承認中國之絕對獨立完整、惟精細之觀察家多人相信、現在調停中日事件、已較一九三八年以來任何時期為宜、日人之種種迫切求和之表示、與美國在日本未宣佈真實態度以前對德作戰之關切、不應巧合云、（十九日合眾電）</p>

<h3>米市跌價與今後</h3>
<p>政治氣息則惡濁而漆黑，全沒有現代公民所得享受，所得呼吸的自由；治安則匪盜橫行，生命財產喪失了當然的合法的安全保障；行動祇許侷促於小天地之中，此外便荊棘載途；物價祗漲三五倍者眞是鳳毛麟角，反是生活日用必需品大多暴漲了十倍八倍乃至數十倍；總之，凡百精神的物質的悽雲慘霧逼近了每一上海居民的眉睫，不容他抬頭正視；由漸而來，變本加厲，旣經三五年，而以最近一二年爲更甚。却在這數天，米價自一百四五十元，一跌再跌，接近了百元關隘；緣是而上海居民覺得稍稍地舒一些氣，或是數年來強顏歡笑的初决吧！而本報在一年以來，屢决主張租界當局務謀自行集資辦米；現在纔見實行之後，便見米價銳跌，當然覺得不勝其忻慰。</p>
<p>米價跌至百元有零。絕非謂居民旣已獲釋重負，生活自此輕鬆了：工部局辦米平售，絕非謂上海民食有着，一切解決而無復問題了。要知道百元的米價，依然是中等以及中等以下的生活程度者所認爲果腹惟艱。上海戶口密集而與糧食產地不能通暢的調節供需，工部局以地方行政機關而不得不自營米糧的買賣，這種現象與辦法，豈可恃以持久？何况民生所以艱難，在米貴之外，尙有柴炭油鹽以及一切衣食所必需，無一不貴；米價銳跌而未賤，其他物價更未隨米價而銳跌，是社會在經濟方面感受的嚴重威脅，離開解除猶遠。或說一般物價趨嚮下游，亦待由漸而然，米價跌無數日，原來不必奢望其他物價隨之遽跌：換言之，米價跌了，其他物價終必徐徐下降。這是合理的說明，且得作進一步的論斷，假使米價持續這數天的市面，或且持續其跌勢，則其他物價萬無不跌之理；一因百貨生產成本的關係，百業日常開支的關係，米價必然影響百貨；二因人心關係，盲從的反動關係，往日追隨米價而百貨不必要的漲價，今因米價而自然歸趨原狀：三因米價本身所具有的趨跌因素，不問其爲政令的，道德的，社會輿情的，或商業的，必同時亦爲百貨趨跌的因素；因此之故，正不必爲百貨未跌而愁悶。雖然，種種正常因素之外，尙有壟斷，操縱，搗亂之類的人爲因素，亦蔚然其爲市面的慕後決定者；一二年來市面的橫跳暴漲之不已，豈盡因成本高，貨源稀，存底薄，需要增，强半由於人爲；即如昨日米市又抬高三四元五六元不等，不由人爲，別無理由！這種的詭謀蠢動，必須由租界當局與居民，協力抑制，共謀應付；吾則不但百貨無復隨米價間低降之望，米價且有回漲之虞；到那時候，工部局辦米平售的辦法亦必事倍功半了。語曰痛定思痛，又曰居安思危，上海官民在此數年來難得强顏歡笑的今日，切莫疏懈，以爲功成利溥、庶幾高枕無憂了；固不但企圖吮吾血，吸吾隨者，窺伺多方，詭謀百出，即就目前朋以鞭策米市，使之回頭而銳跌者，乃爲不出顆穀之香港而論，根本上便不容倚之如泰山；上海與香港之間，豈必無波濤阻隔？香港與產地之間，亦容有旦夕不測之風雲！是以從今日以迄新榖上市之秋冬，上海民食應如何保持穩定，務須在此强顏歡美之際，把握機宜妥籌辦法。米蠹目前的悲哀不足恤，亦惟有置米蠹於萬刧不復之地獄，而後可以儆戒來茲！</p>

<h3>倫敦大火記</h3>
<p>所以我們只能立在無人的街道之上、坐看玻璃鏡盒爆裂，結婚戒指熔化。這一幕悲劇，比之敎堂的焚燬尤慘，因爲敎堂自有虔誠信敎的人捐款重修，但那店舖卻不會有好事者過問的了。</p>
<p>在街道彼處，一羣人正自地窖中蜂湧而出。他們精疲力倦，形色可憐。防空員幫着負被褥等物。他們立在人行道上，有茫無所措之感。他們告訴馬格利說，起先本在離此四分之一英里的一個掩蔽所中。但防空員對他們說，上面的房屋已經起火，祇得携帶被褥枕頭到另一處地方。到這裏還祇有一小時，防空員又叫他們移動了。這已是第三次，現在再到那裏去呢？他們雖無所適從，但沒有人抱怨，也沒有人發狂。</p>
<p>防空員都是強毅的倫敦人。他們雖已疲勞不堪，但仍不屈不撓，這種堅忍的英國精神，一晚上都可看到。</p>
<p>當我們走在一條彎彎曲曲的街道上時，有風徐徐吹來。在一個轉彎地方，救火員排成兩行，背對我們，望著街上瀑布一般的火焰。我從他們衣領上的徽章，知道他們是從倫敦遠鄉來的。他們雖然對馬格利搖頭表示不妥，又警告我們謹防磚瓦落下，但仍讓我們通過。這時風勢漸猛，馬格利的頭髪，在頭前飚揚，裙子也在膝彎被風吹起，我也撳住帽子。一陣陣的冷氣，從街上衝來，把數百萬方呎的熱氣趕跑，這火又如幾千個烟囱在放氣，便造成了這風。</p>
<p>這排房屋，店面都很狹隘，卻有七層樓高。那火殘酷地向我們進撲，一幢燃燒的房屋，熱氣可以穿過牆壁而使鄰屋起火。在火焰聲中，又可聽得玻璃的破碎聲，繼續不斷，有如淅　瀝瀝的雨聲一般。</p>
<p>風助火威使火花上騰，成了一根紅柱。街道的一端有一小敎堂。在敎堂的黑暗方塲中，火星降落如雨，當牠慢慢地盤旋而下的時候，造成我畢生僅見的奇景。</p>
<p>我們冒險深入火焰中的街道，使後面的救火員也代爲惴惴不安。但是我知道他們所注意的實在是馬格利確是一個極漂亮的女子。她未戴帽子，鬈曲的金黃色頭髪迎風飛舞。和馬格利同行，最使人高興的一件事，就是人人都要帶着讚美而欽敬的意思，回過頭來看她。她不是義大利人所注意的女子，而是瑞典人也要回頭一看的。何況她的態度舉止又顯出她也是勇敢的呢。</p>
<p>承平時候，女人的勇敢，是不甚被人重視的。在她一生之中，或者一次也用不到勇敢。速記的知識都有用萬倍。但是戰爭已把這種情形改變了。勇敢已成爲男女最優良的品質，一個不勇敢的人，立刻會被眾唾棄。</p>
<p>救火員望著馬格利，馬格利卻站着火熖中的街道望去，看着有如雪花飛舞一般的火星。她喊道「這眞是何等的，壯麗呀！」我要穿過這個火窟。</p>
<p>我道，「那不是好玩的！」</p>
<p>馬格利道，「做救火員豈是好玩！我們今夜出遊豈是好玩！以不滿五千萬的英國人，抵抗幾乎一萬萬的德國人，雖道也是好玩的嗎！今夜在倫敦安份守己的人，祇有在陸伏亞大旅館的地下室中可以找到。你跟我來嗎？」</p>
<p>我硬起頭皮答道：「好！」</p>
<p>那個汽車夫受着感動突然說道，「我也要跟你們一同去，這是我的鄉土，我決不會再見這樣的情形了。」他對我們不曾冠以「先生」或「小姐」的稱呼，我聽了倒也很是高興。</p>
<p>我們就沿着烈熖騰空的街道上跑去。我讓馬格利靠在我的一邊，使她和傾圮的房屋隔開。我握住她的一臂，幫她跑過熾熱的磚瓦堆。那車夫也不再在兩步之後跟隨，卻追上前來，握住她的另一臂。</p>
<p>那時火勢猛熾異常，我覺得右頰被炙得要熬出油來了，我把大衣領翻起，又用空着的一手把馬格利的呢大衣領也翻起了。車夫也在那一邊幫忙，同時又很注意她。店舖的門，都有火衝出，好像火爐口一般。店內紅綠色的火光，閃耀不定，眩人雙目，火星紛紛落下，卻是指甲大小的餘燼。我們必須趕快將火星撲去，否則大衣上雖免燒成許多小洞。</p>
<p>後面的爆裂聲音，忽然變成一聲巨響，我們回頭觀看，只見剛才經過的一幢五層樓，已倒坍下來，在兩旁人行道上堆積有數呎來高。我們的後路已斷，祇有乘前面房屋未曾倒坍，把我們困在中間的時候，急急冒烟突火，向前奔去。</p>
<p>我們走過了最後一幢燃燒着的房屋，跑到火星雨下的黑暗小方塲中。但是被烟迷了雙目，連這種大火星都看不見了。我恐怕在濃密的火星之下，馬格利的頭髪有着火的危險，便把我的帽子壓在她頭上。她的兩眼緊閉，車夫也是一樣。我用手撑住眼皮，才能睜開一隻眼睛。我領導他們跑過方塲，經過高低不平之處，便預先警告他們。</p>
<p>最後到了一條并未起火，黑暗如漆的街道上，由此覓路回到停車的地方。這時已是早上四點鐘。馬格利決定不如早些回家，因爲她在七點半鐘還要辦公呢。</p>
<p>馬格利道：「這火景不是很美麗嗎？那些人不是很好的嗎？」</p>
<p>我從未見過再好的人了。</p>
<p>馬格利道：「這班人眞是溫文，廉潔，勇敢，鎭定，兼而有之。但是現在我要睡了」</p>
<p>於是我們送她到家，車夫又送我到家。我在付車費時，他很嚴肅的說，他眞不惜　切，不能失此觀火的良機。而他又把「先生」或「小姐」的稱呼忘記了。</p>

<h3>昨日全市宣傳　汽車禁聲運動　自備汽車勿收聽無綫電　以免分散司機人之神思</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局警務處及車務處、以汽車司機每多喜濫撳喇叭、其目的無非欲馬路其他車輛行人避讓、以期加增速度、惟與市民工作休息睡眠等殊多關碍、因其聲浪擾雜、間接足以分散神思、故一向嚴禁在醫院及學校附近濫撳喇叭、以策</p>
<p>公眾安寧</p>
<p>茲復聯合法租界當局、於百日起推行「取締汽車喇叭聲運動宣傳週」、並查新式汽車、多有無錢電收音設備、過去且有人主張公共汽車中加裝無綫電收音機、以利乘客、間以减少其寂寞、當時公用委員會以此種揹施、在車輛行駛中、</p>
<p>路人神思</p>
<p>每易分散、問接將使車輛肇禍事件之增加、故經否決、並勸自備汽車有無綫電設備者、不得收聽、其用意純爲公衆之秩序、及减少交通阻碍與不幸事件、茲聞此項運動、將繼續至二十六日爲止、此後宣傳運動結束後、推行工作並不中止、昨日實行後、各電台及電影院亦廣爲宣傳、喇叭聲確已大見减少、崗捕亦隨時指示司機、如有濫撳喇叭者、並抄錄號碼、予以儆吿、仍希各車主及司機繼續協助捕房及公衆、俾今年夏季</p>

<h3>運米輪雙增多　洋米產價傾跌　米號發售港米均縣木牌　工部局盼市民購廉價米</h3>
<p>據工部局公吿、凡發售本局洋米之米店、門首均懸有木牌一方、上書「本店出售工部局洋米、今日市價每石一百十元」中英文字樣（參看附照）、所以表示各該米店均已同意按照本局規定辦法、發售洋米、希望市民協助本局、向各該米店購買此米、</p>
<p>米號發售概須登記</p>
<p>日前立基洋行奉工部局諭、定制各米號承銷港米之登記表一紙、內分六項、（一）店名、（二）地址、（三）執照號碼、（四）一九四〇年每月平均售米、（五）今日售出工部局洋米、（六）店主簽章、是項登記表格、立基洋行已辦理完竣、共七百餘本、昨日下午送工部局審核、今日當可分發各米號、每本計表格六十頁、並編有號碼、足供各米號兩月之用、據悉、各米號添善後、每週送至立基洋行、以備查考、</p>
<p>過磅退款下周開始</p>
<p>首批港米本埠訂購行號、共計七百四十三家、迄至昨日爲止、已柱鮮茂洋行付款者、已有五百七十餘家、尙有一百七十餘家、預料本週內當可結束、至各米行號前往堆棧提貨、重量有少數不滿二百二十四磅者、均持過磅重量單至祥茂洋行退款、該洋行以付款手續尙水了結、至於過磅退款手續、決於下週一開始、各米行號可保留過磅重量單、於下星期一前往退款、</p>
<p>洋米糧來源愈涌</p>
<p>國洋米糧來源、自經兩租界當局積極疏通以還、運米航輪業經增多、西貢暹羅仰光等洋米產區、產價下瀉、暨國內各產米區米糧運滬數額、頗有增無减、近一月來、按日運滬米糧、平均在二萬包以上、米棧存底、頃已增至二百二十萬包以上、昨據米業方面消息、邇日因洋米產價低落、成交數額頗較前爲夥、裝華綸洋行經理之Sarrant輪貢米二萬五千包、可於今日扺埠、傳係法租界公董局向越南訂購第一批廉米之一部、但法方尙未設實、</p>
<p>米蠢作祟抬高米價</p>
<p>自工部局辦理出售港米後、米價即見驟降、統計半月來最高洋米、每包已由一百六十五元跌至一百十一元、共跌五十四元之鉅、當局抑平米價之主旨、因已達成、但一般米蠧、則無不大感恐慌、深恐工部局洋米越來越多、故連日竭力設法出脫、無如市塲現貨充斥、無人間津、其狼狽可知、詎知昨日，彼輩又力圖挽回頹勢、藉口甬地向滬採購、並有人企圖私運出境內銷、米價又被肆意抬高四五元、西貢一號由一百十一元漲至一百十六元、小絞米由一百零三元漲至一百零七元、</p>
<p>曇花一現絕無影響</p>
<p>據悉此種現象、係曇花一現、因工部局洋米之價格、由當局規定、市塲上價格之上落、與之絕無影響、若米蠧抬價、則居民儘可購買工部局洋米、且各米號之出售工部局洋米、數量旣須逐日登記、則不致流入囤戶之手、故昨日米價之反動情形、亦不過廻光反照而已、又訊、本市各工廠商號、已可向立基洋行訂購工部局洋</p>

<p>（一）名報指責集中於奸商、惟申報時評、若諷若嘲、可於意會中得之、工部局受言論之督促、固辦港米矣、然到了要緊關頭、仍留餘步、先生知之乎、曾憶及先生之申報時評中、有以玻璃匣陳列米樣於門前以便購奢之有所對照、此扼要之辦法也、</p>
<p>（二）今到了實施之時、對於此扼要之辦法、絕對不提及、則米店中之所謂每一元一角者、不難爲極不堪之劣米、其眞正由港辦來之米、轉爲奸商多一批器財之貨色而已、倘果有此朝三暮四之行爲、則本爲安定社會之舉、不能有始有終、遂變成可痛可恨之事、</p>
<p>（三）故於最後要緊關頭（即發賣之際）、應行嚴格之督察、吾則惟利而圖、正如捕捉蛇蛙之惡丐、而筆伐口誅、誠心安定社會如光生輩者、亦如買放蛇蛙之老太婆而已、證以往事、爲此杞憂、但願言而不中、敬望先生亦注意及之、以免虧此一簣、</p>
<p>編者按：偶見法租界各米店已在各米箱中、分別標簽、寫明價格、雖無米樣陳列、然較之僅懸一紙板、較爲完備、蓋買米者不難就各米店所陳列所標明之米樣米價、有比較之機會、即米商少一欺騙顧客之弊、事屬易舉、公共租界不難仿行、至樣米陳列、果能辦到、非但顧客便利、亦肅淸攪雜作僞之一道也、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯期現軋平</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市、匯豐掛牌各滙仍無仲縮、英美滙暗市仍匯六月期美金徵露硬化、餘趨呆定、乃傳美國調解中日戰爭、華商投機家供售、金價又疲落、致五元三七五硬至可桔、下午交稀價呆、終僅六月美金長〇三一二五、爲五元三七五、已賤逾現貨、餘及英匯均平、成交淸稀、</p>
<p>局勢定形穩定</p>

<h3>金市潛勢向下　現貨獨見加高</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、變動力仍薄弱、濟勢重向下游、乃風聞蘇聯評論日方需求美國調解戰事、更見急迫、且美滙遠月趨鬆、致上週末午收前後之堅昂、各方人心復趨軟化、滙票商新豐永雖仍加碼力進、而證券銀號兩幫供多求少、散戶均懷空頭心思、價由晨開六千四百七十元、盤退至午後見六千四百三十二元、終見德大金號力進、稍挽頹勢、收市六千四百五十元、復小十三元、若比上週末收盤價、則小三十元、全日交易共三萬兩、現金步見加高、新豐永出九十兩、價照期交高一百三十元、宏康永出一百十兩、高二百四十元、均由成記買進、後德孚出老天賣五十兩、方五霞三十兩、寳成公記二十兩、均高二百叫十五元、下午未聞做開、價照期交的高二百四十元、軋升數元、首飾余仍平、掛六百九十元、至（五月轉入六月掉期、於午後賣方貼出予買方五十五元、做開數十兩云、</p>

<h3>證劵　公債午後略振</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市況、上午極為平和、午後因消息關係、又略爲提高、因傳有日本挽美國出而調停中日戰事之說、但美國以經否認、此種傳說、足見爲單面之意相情願、離事實太遠、影響市面者亦極有限、公債之所以提高二三角、亦爲一部份之買進、老多頭又乘機出籠、仍不外爲盤旋局面、昨日上午同康·德昌買進、九成·永孚及聯和賣出、市價平定、無甚參差、午後聯和廣爲收買、的五十萬、丙種復穿出六元關、德孚·同康·聯益·永昌供出、而益昌·謙益仍有賣出、爲德昌·易中所買進、市况仍係盤旋帶軟之勢、結果一致回好一角半至五角、成交的二百二十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　實銷暗淡如故　紗市下挫</h3>
<p>紗市盤旋而下挫、此因實際交易毫無進展之狀、致人心暗淡、惟一般財力充足之戶、吸收之額、堅不吐出、所以金子幫、證券幫雖有巨量的拋賣、缺少實貨交解、於是多頭利出此一點拉緊、非但不放逢下墜時反來加碼、檯面被其支持、然就環境而論、市面未許樂觀也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百八十五元、低價爲一千四百六十四元、午後初做一千四百六十五元、跌至一千四百六十元、回昂至一千四百七十元、最後價爲一千四百六十九元、</p>

<h3>怎樣研究圖畫（一）</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>一，爲什麽要研究圖畫</p>
<p>在討論怎樣研究圖畫之前、我們先要問、爲什麼研究圖畫、牠的目的是什麽、明白了、然後再談研究、方感興趣、我們知道圖書是藝術、藝術可以啟發大才、陶冶品性的、而敎育的目的無非尋求智識、應付環境、理智功利之外、還該啟發天才、培植德性、而圖畫便是啟發和培植的最好工具、譬如、自然科學太枯燥了、我們藉圖畫的欣賞、來調濟精神的沉悶理智太現實了、我們藉圖畫的力量、來解脫功利的牢籠、因此中外古今的大哲學家、大科學家、大政治家、大文學家無不有藝術的涵養、圖畫的陶冶、牛頓·羅騷·孟德斯鳩·太戈爾·孔·孟·老·莊以及王摩詰·蘇東坡之流、都曾經研究圖畫、使他們卓越的天才、得有充分的發揮、銳利的思想、得有純潔的陶鎔、偉大的事業、得有精密的成就、我們再狹義一點說、一般的學科、非偏於用腦、就偏於用手、不如研究圖畫的觀察對象、描寫輪廓、敷設色彩、審別美惡的「腦」與「手」同時運用、思想和動作兼全配台、可收雙管齊下的功効、至於終身研究、以藝術感發人類、宣揚政敎而名傳後世的畫家、和西洋文藝時期的Leonardo，Rapheal，十九世紀的Ingres以及我國唐朝吳道子、宋朝董北苑、元朝倪雲林、明朝唐伯虎、淸朝王石谷等枚等不勝舉、都是專門的大家、父當別論了、</p>
<p>二、圖畫的內容是怎樣</p>
<p>我們研究圖畫的目的明白了、第二步就該明瞭圖畫的內容、世界上圖畫的系統可分爲二、一爲東方畫系、一爲西洋畫系、西洋畫系是萌芽滋長在歐陸的意大利半島、分枝散葉到令歐、最近一二世紀中、又移植到美洲各聯邦、同時傳播及於東亞、東方畫系、則起源於中國本部一方面受西亞印度的影響、發生了相當變化、再由朝鮮而及於日本、數千年來東西洋的繪畫、各本民族性的过長、風俗習慣的不同、各有各的造詣而在最近幾世紀中、因爲交通的發達、相互起了調和的現象、現在從內容和形式方面分開來說、一、中國繪畫分爲人物畫、（包括佛像、肖像仕女等）風景盡、（包括山水、紀遊人物佈景等）、寫生畫、（包括花卉·翎毛·魚虫·走獸·等）雜畫（包括歷史人物畫壁盡等）等、在唐以前祇有人物畫、唐以後才發明山水畫、經過五代宋元、一直到現在、都把山水畫做正宗、至於生寫畫等產生、（中國書裹寫生、指花烏等而言、也是記憶畫與西洋畫裏的寫生不同）、還在宋元以後、正和西洋畫的在十九世以前、祇有人物畫、十九世以後才有風景畫的情形彷彿、</p>

<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>科學發明戰</h3>
<p>— 潘禮</p>
<p>今日英德兩國間的戰爭，不僅是軍事上的陣地戰或海空戰，也不僅是政治戰，經濟戰，生產戰，對鎖戰或神經戰了。我們看看此决歐戰後所發生的幾件事實，就可以明白這决的爭，也是英德科學家與發明家間的戰爭。</p>
<p>在戰事爆發不久以後，德方在海面上施放磁性水雷。這種新武器是前所未見的，英方有不少的船隻遇難了，於是央國科學家遂實行總動員，合力研究對付磁性水雷的力法，結果在九天之內，就把方法研究了出來，使德方無法施其技倆。</p>
<p>在此决的戰爭中，德機所投擲的炸彈，其質量均出乎一般人士的意想以外。一隻小小的飛機，不但可以携帶大量的炸彈，而且破壞力極爲猛烈。這一點英方可說是自嘆不如的。可是央國的科學家並不肯甘休，他們還是孜孜地在實騐室中研究，據說結果已經發明一種炸力兇猛而携帶輕便的新式炸彈，可使每架轟炸機的破壞力增强百份之五十。據英方宣佈，這種炸彈的製法，是嚴守秘密的，不過炸彈本身，將於最近數月內發揮威力。</p>
<p>如果這個消息是確實的話，預料德國科學家也一定不甘示弱，將有新發明的武器出來對抗的。可是後方的平民却要遭殃了。</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3>秘密武器？</h3>
<p>— 王迦培</p>
<p>在戰爭的時候，各交戰國中的科學家，都在竭盡智慮地研究新武器，甚至一般平民也將許多想入非非的新建議，寄到各軍事機關去。</p>
<p>在上决歐戰的時候，英國曾有人建議用一種快乾的水門汀噴射到敵方的壕溝中，在一霎時中，使敵力的士兵都「呆若頑石」。也有人主張將坦克車改成巨型的劉草機，四面裝上鋒利的刀片，在衝進敵陣的時候，刀片舞動，可將敵兵斬殺如同砍瓜切菜一般。</p>
<p>這决歐戰中，英國每星期差不多可以收到三百件建議，但是有用的還小到百分之一呢。下面是各方在三月內的一星期中有趣的建議和發明。</p>
<p>（一）英國的航空專家諾爾貝林，痛斥在夜襲時熄滅燈火的無理。他主張應當集中各種强力的燈，一致向天空照射，使整個被襲的區域，恍如「光海」。這樣敵極的照明彈旣屬無用而夜襲機更因燈光眩目也無從瞄準投彈了。</p>
<p>（二）瑞士沮利克傳來的消息說，德方近來用飛機過酒一種化學物劑在一般工廠森林兵房和住宅的上面，使它們有防火的功效，能抵禦英空軍投下的燃燒片。</p>
<p>（三）還有一種發明，就是現在德方已經能將潛水艇的外表漆成和海水一樣的顏色（本來潛艇都是灰色），雖然海水能因時因地而改變顏色，可是潛艇能在升出水面的一刹間，用噴射槍將適合海水顏色的油漆噴射完畢。</p>
<p>至於英方的各種新建議，大半是作應付侵略之用的。</p>
<p>（一）在各軍事要塞地點，設置碩大的磁石，去攪亂來侵犯船隻上的指南針，以致使它們失郤方向走入迷途。</p>
<p>（二）在英空軍飛機的螺旋槳上（普通謂推進器），裝上極長的電綫，這樣在飛動的時候，可有半英哩大的「死網」。在空戰的時候允其收效。</p>
<p>（三）在通衢大道上裝好高電壓的電網，使敵方坦克車中的士兵觸電而死。</p>
<p>（四）至於將來英方攻襲歐洲大陸時，可以採用一種兩棲性的坦克車，在杜佛的海邊爬下海，在海峽中一直潛行，等到了法國的岸邊，再行突然的爬上岸，而給敵方一個驚異的打擊。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）　可感的友情</p>
<p>當趙玉崑隨着姓李的護士走進了七號病房以後，秋海棠所僅餘的一個眸子便一動也不動的看定着他，玉崑的視綫當然也集中在他那紮滿了紗布的臉上，兩個人足足有五分鐘不會出聲。</p>
<p>秋海棠這一副狼狽的情熊原在玉崑意料之中，但玉崑的突然變得那樣憔悴消瘦，却不是他師弟所能料想到的。</p>
<p>「二哥，梅實怎麼樣了？」秋海棠忍不住先昂起頭來問。</p>
<p>「很好。」</p>
<p>又靜默了一二分鐘。</p>
<p>「老三，恭喜你！你不是一直不願意唱小嗓子嗎？往後你就再要唱也不成了，這倒是天從人願！」別人都是吃飯長大的，唯有趙玉崑，却像是開玩笑長大的；把弟兄在這毽環境之下重會，他統共祗說了一句正經話，便又故熊復萌的說起風話來了。</p>
<p>秋海棠忙着把右眼向他瞅了一瞅，心裏委實不願意讓醫院裏的人知道自己的眞面目。「這裏是醫院還是監牢，老三？」玉崑就在病床左邊的一張小椅上坐了，眼睛斜望着那女看護，嘴裏這樣問。</p>
<p>不等秋海棠理會得他是什麼意思而答復他之前，玉崑已把最後一句話說出來了：</p>
<p>「爲什麽不能讓我跟你單獨說話呢？」秋海棠知道他又在那裏放刁了，險些從綳帶下面笑出來。</p>
<p>「因爲周先生的病勢很不好，所以我們要留在這裏照料他。」那個女看護倒也很聰明，知道玉崑的話純粹是對她而發的，便一路走向門邊去，一路微笑着說：「旣然這樣，我可以暫時出去休息一會，周先生假使要什麼束西的話，請打鈴！」</p>
<p>「勞駕，勞駕！」秋海棠來不及的向她說，聲晉始終是非常的低弱。（一一〇）</p>
<h3>赫斯駕駛的飛機</h3>
<p>— 郭洪迪</p>
<p>此决德國第三領袖赫斯出亡飛英，所乘的是一架德國有名的毛瑟施密特一一〇式戰鬥機，機上並有彈痕纍纍，可見以前是曾與英機在空中交綏過的。</p>
<p>最近英方曾擊下德國的毛瑟施密特一一〇式飛機一架，該機墜地方完好無缺，英國航空部特將該機送與美國，作爲研究之用，由貨船蒙土南號運戰，經巴拿馬運河，於四月五日安抵紐的。</p>
<p>美國飛機工程師研究的結果，認爲該種飛機，製造精良，堪與英美第一流飛機相抗衡。該機速率每小時可達三百六十五哩以上，飛程八百哩，頭部裝有開關槍四架，大砲二尊，尾部並有旋轉槍一架。該機可容三人，機師，無綫電員及槍手各一。該機有一千一百五十馬力之發動機二，可作戰鬥及保護機之用，可燃用劣質燃料，極爲經濟，其唯一缺點爲保護機座之鐵板太薄云。</p>

<h3>表姐的信</h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>爲着避免無謂的轟炸，我們的醫院已遷到重慶附近某地來了。</p>
<p>雖是項簡單的設備，但賴着每一個醫生，護士的努力，病人感覺十分滿意。這裏所收容的，多數是平民階級；山於她們身體的健全，生產非常平順，兩個月來，我們還沒有碰到一個難產的。</p>
<p>在上海，開刀，分盤骨，是太普通的一回事；重慶，由於都市人物的薈集，也常有施行手術的。但在這裏，也許我們會忘了接生的技能了。造物者眞不偏待每一個！</p>
<p>除了院務，我們也常出去作些考察工作。</p>
<p>川中人民，的確已經瞭解什麼叫做國難，什麼叫做責任！他們雖都在一般水平綫下的生活狀態中，但沒有怨聲，沒有嘆息，每一個都站住各位。他們期望的是光明：他們的信念是勝利！</p>
<p>物價雖昂，但一般同胞，已普遍地習慣了節的。有了補塊的衣服，照樣可以赴會。出客，一點不覺寒酸。我的大衣破得不像樣，要是在滬早匕換上新的了，但，這「一千元起碼』的價格激勵了我，使我放棄了唯美觀，破大衣一樣可以禦寒，誰敢小覬我？</p>
<p>白玉霜，三花粉的氣味，我連想都想不起來了。同事們一律塗用本地蜂蜜，絕對不拍粉，一張發亮的臉，表理得精神百倍！</p>
<p>現在我們在計劃夏天的服襲：</p>
<p>一律穿短衣褲，露腿，鞋子用廢布編成漏空式的。我想漂亮不足，『摩鱟』倒有餘哩！</p>
<p>眞的，這裏有自由，有靈魂！我們可以奔馳，我們可以唱歌！我忘了我是翳學博士，我是產婦主任，我只覺得我是一個孩子，一個散佈快樂的天使！</p>

<h3>卓別麟談　戰時影業及其前途</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>戰時只需要娛樂的喜劇　戰事片應待和平後拍攝</p>
<p>在卓別麟的會客室裏，美麗的陽光從窗口射入，映在牆壁上作光亮的黃金色，在桌子邊坐着一位身材矮小，頭髮灰白，脣邊還留着一撮短髭的男人，他一眼看去幾乎疑是「大獨裁者」希特勒，再看一眼，原來希特勒的短髭和他是一樣的呀，卓氏披着一件黑色大衣，雙目炯炯，沉默許久，遂開始向記者們發話了。</p>
<p>「歐洲每一决戰事，對於世界必有一點影響，這决歐戰像這樣的猛烈，對於好萊塢自其相當影響。這使我們更能瞭解民衆們的問題，又給我們以國際的意識，這使好萊塢的人亦悟到好萊塢畢竟也是美國的一部，並非什麽世外桃源，可以不受戰事的影響。我們雖非直接捲人戰事的漩渦中去，不過經濟與情緒上却大受影響，我們全國商業情形，將因此而起變化，好萊塢當不能例外。」</p>
<p>「戰事直接所引起的影響。」他接着說：「是在銀幕上介紹更多的玩笑資料，不僅爲了國內，也爲了國外人民和兵士的煩惱。只有當我們到了承平時代，才能獻出更多的眼淚。所以一到和平條的簽訂之後，我們將有許多偉大的戰爭片，如果不結束呢，那末繼續的還是娛樂的喜劇片。因爲觀衆看影片的心理是爲娛樂，並非爲了新閒。報道新聞是報紙及無綫電的職務，而影片的藝術是以動作與情緒爲基本的。」</p>
<p>「此外，我可預測到一九四二年間，好萊塢將有許多小公司成立，他們基於合作精神而製出精美的影片來，它們可以找住時代的需要，完全合乎社會的心理，而使電影比今日成爲更重要更普遍的事業，道些創造家所嘗試的東西，將成爲現在那些大公司所夢想小及的。明星也是如此，那時我們固然要幾個出色人物，如蓓蒂黛維絲，嘉寳，史本塞屈賽等人的藝術，不過我們也要有現代意識的明星，只要他們能够合於時代，就司成爲好演員。</p>
<p>「同時影迷將變爲更嚴厲起來，戰事將成爲談話的中心資料，社會上起經濟的波浪，在表面上似乎不大影響到個人生活，可是將後，道經濟的波動將及於世界各國，誰都不知道將來怎樣，我們立於一個過渡時代中，未來全恃我們目前的所作所爲，不過照例，大戰之後，各社會必有一番巨大的變化，所以數年之後，好萊塢的生活也將大大她改變了。」</p>
<p>「至於我。」卓氏，很俏皮的笑着說：一未來的計劃尙未一定，本來在事業之中要固定一條路走是很難的。總之，我愛好萊塢，我愛電影和我的朋友，但我並不大喜歡它的空氣，在洛杉磯的商人眼光中，我也許是個怪人吧！不過我所尋求的是永久的光明。」</p>

<p>李麗華是多方面的演員？她可以演許多不同身份的戲，許多不同情緒的戲，如在「新茶花女」中她同時演一個村姑及都會少女，因身份的不同，也就有許多快樂。悲哀·憂愁傷感等情感，一九四一年的影壇，李麗華將是最成功的演員之一。</p>
<p>「新茶花女」的演員陣終中，除李麗車鄭重之外，還有張翠英·關宏達·范雪朋·嚴化等。（上圖係李鄭二人之表情）</p>
<h3>影劇交響曲</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>韓蘭根殷秀岑，本是一雙在銀幕上單純地製造一些滑稽的笑料的丑角而已。最近，却因主演吳永剛的「人海寃魂」，故事的內客雖也以滑稽作主體，整個的主題却在强烈給予社會的畸形制度一種幽默的諷刺和抨等，於是大大感動，兩人共同思索一個同一意義的喜劇故事，劇名內定「上海淘金記」，殷秀岑親自執筆編寫草綱，全部對白與分塲的劇本，則請裴冲負資。</p>
<p>天風劇團的「上海屋簷下」，在吳復之導演下，將用各地方言演出，原理則在各地人口集中上海，如果「國語統一」，難免有人無從理解，以及懷疑在一幢房屋里，難道個個都會講國語嗎？從此類推，天風過去演過的「十字街頭」，以上海劇藝社正在公演的「愁城記」，也因素描上海關係似乎都應放棄國語，至以各地方言演出，如此，話劇文明戲化，就可發揚而擴大了！</p>
<p>朱石麟一手支持下的合衆公司，因爲傾向古裝影片的原故，所以「碧蘿公主」後，尙預備再攝一部同一性質的古裝影片，劇本已在朱石麟編寫中。不過，王熙春却認古裝影片已經落伍，提出意見，不同意再披上古裝的外衣，攝製這一類既落伍又無歷史性的所謂古裝片。</p>

<h3>Regarding the Alleged U.S.-Soviet Agreement: Chinese Government Issues Statement – Will Continue Fighting Until Japanese Troops Withdraw from Chinese Territory, No Peace Possible</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Sources of the highest authority here reiterated today that China will not discuss peace until Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from China and Manchuria. They also stated that Japan's attempts to induce the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese War are propaganda intended to confuse international opinion and delay U.S. aid to China. Chinese authorities pointed out that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is a definite principle understood by all Chinese people, not a basis for negotiation. Authorities emphasized that, to date, Japan has shown no sincerity in establishing peace on this basis. Therefore, this publicity by Japan will absolutely not deceive foreign governments. Authorities further stated that Japan's propaganda is being put forth as the U.S. government intensifies its material and technical aid to China, and that Japan's message is exploratory in nature, seeking to test U.S. preparedness for military cooperation with China in the Pacific. Political observers pointed out that the conditions for mediation published in Moscow newspapers are self-contradictory. If Japanese troops withdraw, how can they maintain their main position in China? Political observers noted the prominent placement of the mediation news in Soviet newspapers with great interest. However, Chinese and foreign figures doubt that the U.S. will attempt to mediate according to the conditions published in Soviet newspapers. They point out that these conditions are very similar to the notorious Lansing-Ishii Agreement, which caused years of serious difficulties for U.S. Far Eastern policy. The Chinese side does not wish to comment on the mediation proposal put forward by Senator Thomas, a Democratic Senator from Utah. Thomas advocates organizing an American committee agreed upon by both China and Japan to gradually mediate. Chinese military figures state that amidst these peace rumors, Japanese troops are launching attacks on two key fronts on all major fronts, intending to confuse foreign governments and Chinese troops fighting on the front lines. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Political Circles Consider Mediation of War to Be an Exploratory Ploy by Japan</h3>
<p>Washington – Government circles here yesterday considered the news carried by Izvestia of Japan's proposal for the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese War to be a "trial balloon." Most officials declined to comment. Well-informed sources said that the news was originally published in a New York newspaper, but was issued by the Tokyo office, likely indicating a semi-official attempt to gauge the reaction of China and the United States to this plan. Officials neither confirmed nor denied receiving the proposal, but well-informed sources expressed doubt as to whether the authorities had actually received it. Political leaders such as Senator Thomas, a Democratic Senator from Utah, and the government's most powerful diplomat and Far East writer, criticized it personally. Senator Thomas told a United Press reporter that mediation is worthy of consideration, but dismissed the news carried by Pravda as unrealistic. Thomas said that he had long urged a gradual solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and added that if an American mediation committee, agreed upon by both China and Japan, could be established to gradually seek a solution to this problem based on reality, the differences between the two countries could be gradually eliminated and the balance of power in the Far East restored. Thomas also said that any proposal that does not give Tokyo and Chongqing equal footing beforehand is bound to fail. He added that the issue of Japan's recognition of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek cannot become a goal of mediation. "The United States must not exchange China's rights for rights in the South Pacific. China is a complete country in both fact and law. Whether Japan is willing to advance south or not cannot be a point of selling out China's rights. These two points are completely different matters. China's rights have been established due to the regeneration of the country's resources. No mediation may sell out these rights; what can be mediated are only differences and disputes, certainly not exclusive rights." Thomas also suggested including the American Federation of Labor or Latin American countries as part of this mediation committee to broaden the base. Others expressed indifference towards mediation unless Japan agrees beforehand to recognize China's absolute independence and integrity. However, many astute observers believe that mediating the Sino-Japanese conflict now is more appropriate than at any time since 1938. The various urgent appeals for peace from the Japanese, and the U.S. concern about fighting Germany before Japan announces its true intentions, should not coincide. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Three Basic Points of Alleged U.S.-Soviet Agreement</h3>
<p>New York – According to a report from the Tokyo correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune, authoritative sources claim that the United States recently received a proposal from unofficial Japanese sources to conclude a U.S.-Japan agreement on all of the Far East and the South Seas. The purpose of this proposal is to test the attitude of the U.S. government, including the following basic points for establishing a U.S.-Japan agreement: (1) The United States mediates the Sino-Japanese War, and Japanese troops first withdraw from the internal provinces of China. (2) The United States recognizes Japan's superior position in China. (3) Japan guarantees to avoid</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador to Japan Meets with Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Tokyo – U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka at his private residence at Matsuoka's invitation. The nature of the conversation is not yet known. However, Japanese sources said that the U.S. ambassador and his wife were invited to a tea party at the Foreign Minister's private residence. It was also said that Grew recommended a special American doctor to treat Matsuoka's cold after his return from a tour of Europe. It was also said that Matsuoka may invite the British ambassador to his tea party. (United Press dispatch, 19th) taking hostile action in the South, and the United States makes significant economic concessions to Japan (allowing it in the South). At the same time, the U.S. may provide Japan with large loans. The correspondent also stated that some parties believe that the U.S. government has seriously considered the above Japanese proposal, but before starting negotiations, the U.S. will require Japan to fulfill the following conditions: (1) Japan should not insist on the statement made in January 1938 that it will not have any contact with General Chiang Kai-shek. (2) Japan should change its declaration that it will not accept third-party mediation. (3) Japan should explain its economic plans in the Far East. It is said that the agreement also stipulates that Japan may not use the Axis powers to deal with the United States. As for whether the Japanese government will give serious consideration to this proposal put forward by Japanese sources, it is impossible to ascertain. However, Japanese opinions are still highly divided. Some parties advocate making peace with Chongqing, but another part strongly advocates continuing the war and recognizing Nanjing. When mentioning this issue, Pravda stated, "According to other sources, the U.S.-Japan agreement proposal was not put forward by the Japanese side; this matter was initiated by the U.S. side." (TASS dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Pravda, the authoritative newspaper of the Soviet Union, yesterday published prominently a New York dispatch stating that reliable Japanese sources in Japan had suggested that the United States mediate the Sino-Japanese War, and that Japan proposed to withdraw Japanese troops from the interior of China, allowing the United States to recognize Japan's position as leader in Asia. At the same time, it is rumored that Japan would also propose not to launch wars in the South Seas, in exchange for obtaining economic rights there, or a loan from the United States. The message also stated that the Japanese side believes that the U.S. government is giving this suggestion serious consideration, but requiring Japan to change its attitude towards Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It was also said that the reaction of the Japanese government to this proposal is unknown, but it is clear that Japanese public opinion is now divided into two factions: one faction wants to establish understanding with Chongqing, and the other demands that the war continue. Pravda did not attach a note, saying, "Other sources" claim that the United States is taking the initiative to mediate the differences between China and Japan. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Bomb Disposal Squad Clears Unexploded Bombs – Begins Work Immediately After Japanese Planes Leave – Recently Discovered Japanese Use of Gasoline Incendiary Bombs</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The "daredevil teams" in London who specialize in digging up unexploded bombs, their bravery, have been praised by the world. However, the Chongqing bomb disposal squad, engaged in the work of excavating unexploded bombs, have been at it for three years now and are considered normal work and no one praises them. In the past two years, quite a few of the Japanese bombs have been unexploded. After each air raid, there are often many caves of unknown cause, which must be explored to see if they are caused by bombs. The Chinese bomb disposal squad, because they know that the Japanese have not used time-delayed bombs, immediately begin digging after the Japanese planes fly away. Sometimes they find that the holes in the ground are caused by stones falling from a high place, but often there are holes pierced by unexploded bombs. The largest of these unexploded bombs was excavated at an intersection in the downtown area of Chongqing last year, measuring up to ten feet deep in the soil. When it was excavated, it weighed 750 kilograms, 30 inches in diameter, and six feet high. The explosives of this unexploded bomb were removed by experts, or sold to chemical medicine merchants, or used to manufacture Chinese munitions, and the shell was used as scrap iron. Chongqing officials often jokingly say that some kind of chemical medicine needed has been shipped by Japan by express airmail. These unexploded bombs have never exploded during excavation, so the excavation does not isolate the area, and onlookers are allowed to watch the excavation. Recently, during an air raid, a bomb landed in the western suburbs of Chongqing. When the bomb disposal squad excavated this unexploded bomb all night, vehicles and pedestrians all circled around the hole. Recently, a bomb dropped on Chongqing pierced the roof and two floors of the National Library. The bomb landed in the wet soil, but the roof and floor of the hole had gasoline-like liquid, and there was a gasoline smell, so the Chinese have discovered that the Japanese army has first decided to use gasoline incendiary bombs in Chongqing.

<h3>Zhou Enlai Refutes Rumors</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Zhou Enlai, the chief liaison officer between the Communist Party and the Chongqing government, absolutely denied today the rumors spread by the Japanese forces that the Eighth Route Army and the Central Army were fighting in the Jin-Yu area. Zhou, the highest leader of the Communist Party stationed in Chongqing, told a United Press reporter that the news of this Nationalist-Communist fighting was absolutely untrue. He said that on the contrary, we should make full use of our strength to fight against Japan, and the Eighth Route Army is now fighting the Japanese army in the area designated by the Central authorities. Zhou made this statement because a Japanese military spokesman had said that Communist troops had not recently fought against Japanese troops. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fall in Rice Prices and the Future</h3>
<p>The political atmosphere is foul and dark, with no freedom for modern citizens to enjoy or breathe. Public security is characterized by rampant bandits, and life and property lack guaranteed legal safety. Movement is only permitted within a small space; beyond that, the path is full of thorns. Price increases of only three to five times are rare, while the daily necessities of life have mostly skyrocketed by ten, eight, or even dozens of times. In short, all kinds of mental and material miseries are pressing upon the brows of every Shanghai resident, not allowing them to look up and face reality. This has been gradually worsening for the past three to five years, with the last year or two being even worse. However, in the past few days, the price of rice has fallen again and again from 140-150 yuan, approaching the 100 yuan mark. As a result, the residents of Shanghai feel a little more relieved, perhaps the first time in years that they have been able to force a smile! Our newspaper has repeatedly advocated for the concession authorities to raise funds to manage rice supplies independently for the past year. Now that we see it being implemented, we are naturally delighted to see the sharp drop in rice prices.</p>
<p>The fall in rice prices to just over 100 yuan does not mean that residents have been released from their heavy burdens and that life is now easy. The municipal council's sale of rice at a fixed price does not mean that Shanghai's food supply is guaranteed, that everything is solved, and that there are no more problems. It must be understood that a rice price of 100 yuan is still considered difficult to afford for those with middle and lower incomes. Shanghai has a dense population and cannot smoothly regulate supply and demand with grain-producing areas. The municipal council, as a local administrative body, has no choice but to operate the buying and selling of rice and grain. How can this phenomenon and method be relied upon to last? Moreover, the difficulty of people's livelihoods lies not only in the high price of rice, but also in the high price of firewood, charcoal, oil, salt, and everything else needed for food and clothing. The sharp drop in rice prices has not been cheap, and other commodity prices have not fallen sharply along with rice prices. The serious threat that society is experiencing in economic terms is far from being relieved. Some say that the general trend of commodity prices towards decline must also happen gradually. After rice prices have fallen for countless days, there is no need to expect other commodity prices to fall sharply with them. In other words, once rice prices fall, other commodity prices will eventually decline slowly. This is a reasonable explanation, and a further judgment can be made. If rice prices continue at this level for the next few days, or even continue to fall, then there is no reason why other commodity prices will not fall. Firstly, due to the relationship between the production costs of various goods and the daily expenses of various industries, the price of rice will inevitably affect various goods. Secondly, due to the relationship between people's hearts and the blind reaction, the unnecessary price increases of various goods that followed the price of rice in the past will naturally return to their original state due to the price of rice now. Thirdly, due to the downward trend factors inherent in the price of rice itself, whether they are political, ethical, societal, or commercial, they must also be factors in the downward trend of various goods at the same time. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the fact that various goods have not fallen in price yet. However, in addition to various normal factors, there are still artificial factors such as monopolies, manipulations, and sabotage that are also a hidden force in determining market conditions. The incessant horizontal jumps and sharp rises in market conditions over the past year or two are not entirely due to high costs, scarce supplies, thin inventories, and increased demand; most of them are due to artificial factors. For example, yesterday's rice market rose again by three or four yuan, or five or six yuan, for no other reason than artificial manipulation! These kinds of conspiracies and machinations must be jointly suppressed and dealt with by the concession authorities and residents. Otherwise, not only can we not hope that various goods will fall along with the price of rice, but the price of rice may also rise again. At that time, the municipal council's method of selling rice at a fixed price will also be twice the effort for half the result. As the saying goes, "Think of pain after the pain has passed," and "Be vigilant in times of peace." On this day when it is difficult to force a smile for the past few years, the officials and people of Shanghai must not be negligent and think that they have achieved success and can rest easy. Not only are there those who attempt to suck our blood and absorb our energy, lurking in many ways and with all kinds of conspiracies, but also with regard to those who are currently spurring the rice market to turn around and fall sharply, the fundamental reason is that Hong Kong, which does not produce a single grain, should not be relied upon as a mountain. Is it possible that there will be no waves or obstacles between Shanghai and Hong Kong? And between Hong Kong and the production areas, there may be unpredictable winds and clouds at any time! Therefore, from today until the autumn and winter when new grain comes on the market, how Shanghai's food supply should maintain stability requires that we seize the opportunity and make proper arrangements during this time when we are forcing ourselves to smile. The sorrow of the rice weevils is not worth pitying at the moment; only by placing the rice weevils in a hell of eternal destruction can we warn future generations!</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull's Broadcast – Announces Two Major U.S. Policies – Guaranteeing Delivery of War Supplies to Britain – And Elucidating Post-War Trade Principles</p>
<p>New York – Last night, Secretary of State Hull broadcast two important announcements regarding U.S. policy. First, he stated that the United States will definitely find a way to guarantee that Britain receives an ample supply. Second, he explained the principles that the U.S. government believes it can lead the world with in restoring peace. These principles are being announced by the U.S. for the first time. Hull stated that most of this year's U.S. foreign trade is for self-defense tools, just as it is futile if goods cannot reach where they are intended. We are practical people. We have decided to do one thing and we will definitely complete it. We are now wholeheartedly engaged in providing arms and aid to those who are most closely related to our defense and security. We must not allow this goal to fail. I have said this before, and I may as well say it again. We will find a way to ensure that the increasingly large amounts of war materials produced in our factories safely reach the hands of those who need them most. The greatest goal of the Axis powers is to seize maritime power so that they can rule the world. If we do not now stop the spread of the behavior of treating the laws of the world as worthless, we will soon be surrounded by aggressors and forced to fight alone in a fight of the few against the many for the sake of our national existence. One or the other must be chosen. Hull then made the first important announcement regarding peace principles, stating that peace principles must include the following points: (1) Extreme nationalism must no longer be allowed to appear in excessive trade restrictions. (2) Non-discrimination must be the norm in international commercial relations, so that international trade can develop and prosper. (3) Raw materials and supplies must be available to all countries without discrimination. (4) International agreements adjusting the supply of goods must be handled in a way that can protect both consumer countries and their people. (5) International financial organizations and methods must be properly arranged to assist each country's necessary enterprises and its continued development, and to use trade procedures suitable for each country's welfare to repay debts. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull said in a radio broadcast yesterday at the opening of National Foreign Trade Week that the significance of the Axis powers defeating Britain is to establish a system of masters and slaves throughout the world. We must carefully consider the defense and security of our own country and ensure that Britain receives a large amount of aid. The lawlessness and unrest in the world must be stopped. Otherwise, our country will be surrounded by aggressor countries and forced to fight alone and seek survival. Hull did not explicitly mention protecting navigation, only mentioning that U.S. war materials must be found a way to reach Britain. The American people are a pragmatic nation. Once we embark on a great undertaking, we will surely complete it seriously. Therefore, we can guarantee that large amounts of war materials from U.S. factories will flow to Britain in a growing stream. Hull also expounded on his lifelong international reciprocity principle, explaining a post-war economic plan that will adopt free and open commercial exchanges throughout the world, including the handling of raw materials without barriers and ample financial assistance, so that all countries can develop production. This plan requires that the threat of supreme military force and conspiracies of annexation be eliminated. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>America Holds "Aid China Week" to Raise Funds for Refugee Relief; China Defends Democratic Nations, Americans Should Sympathize with China's Struggle</h3>
<p>Washington - The "Aid China Week," held simultaneously across the United States, officially opened today. Fourteen state governors and 200 mayors of major cities issued proclamations calling on Americans to cooperate in completing the United China Relief Association's $5 million fundraising campaign to aid Chinese refugees. They emphasized the importance of providing immediate concrete assistance to China, stating that such aid should not only be used for combat but also for disaster relief and reconstruction. This is the first nationwide movement to aid China, aiming not only to raise funds for refugee relief but also to deepen Americans' understanding of China's great resistance war of the past four years and the arduous task of nation-building. This work largely depends on financial and material assistance from American friends. The main activities of Aid China Week are concentrated in New York, where the goal is to raise $1.7 million. Activities throughout the week will focus on cultural circles, women's circles, business circles, and children. Celebrities participating include singer Lily, Lin Yutang, Simpson, and Pearl Buck, among others. At the height of the week's festivities, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, members of Jewish welfare organizations, Salvation Army members, and overseas Chinese from Chinatown will march along major streets in New York City to demonstrate the close cooperation between China and the United States. Sunday (the 25th) is designated as a day of prayer for fallen Chinese soldiers. The Governor of New York issued a statement urging people from all walks of life in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, to provide the greatest possible assistance to this remaining democratic nation. The statement emphasized, "We must see China as the defense line of democratic nations in the Pacific. For nearly a decade, China has resisted the most brutal aggression in history. Most of China's cities have been destroyed, causing us great horror. China is currently one of the great nations practicing democracy and defending democracy. It is now fighting to maintain a free system. Americans greatly sympathize with this nation fighting for freedom. If the freedom and independence of 400 million people are lost, and if Germany, Italy, and Japan truly enslave the Chinese people, the profound impact on American politics and economy is unimaginable. It is extremely important to strengthen China's hope and belief in democracy, so that China can be built into a democratic nation with justice and order." New York Mayor LaGuardia, Chairman of the Mayors' Committee, also issued a statement, saying that China is the only remaining major democratic country in the Far East, fighting for an ideal life, which is also most cherished by Americans. For the past four years, the Chinese people have lived daily under the terror of total war, and their country is constantly in danger of being occupied by totalitarian countries. LaGuardia added that Americans deeply sympathize with nations defending their free homeland and are prepared to provide concrete assistance to China without violating neutrality or getting involved in the war. LaGuardia also urged the citizens of New York to dedicate their efforts this week to helping China.</p>

<h3>Duke Aosta Surrenders to Britain; Italian Forces Collapse in East Africa; British Troops Occupy Amba Alagi; Troops to be Redeployed to Reinforce the Near East</h3>
<p>Cairo - With the formal surrender of Duke Aosta, the Supreme Commander of the Italian forces in East Africa, Mussolini's East African territory has effectively disintegrated, and the Australian troops besieged in Tobruk are also gaining the upper hand. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Amba Alagi, an important crossroads on the road south to Bari, has also been occupied by British troops. It is generally believed that the fall of Amba Alagi is extremely important, as it is not only the strongest fortress of the Italian side but also controls the north-south traffic of the area. It is widely believed that Duke Aosta, in compliance with Hitler's instructions to resist as much as possible in the area in order to contain a portion of British forces, may continue to resist in the Gonder and Great Lakes regions. However, it is believed that Duke Aosta's acceptance of the surrender terms will have a demoralizing effect on other Italian commanders who are determined to fight. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Cairo - After the remaining Italian troops in Amba Alagi, East Africa, surrendered to the British, the terms proposed by the British have been accepted by the Italian forces. The British will take over the city and disarm the Italian troops on a day scheduled soon. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Rome - An official announcement stated that after the Italian troops in Amba Alagi, Italian East Africa, were ordered to cease fire, their commander, Duke Aosta, the Governor of Abyssinia, shared the fate of his troops. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>London - It was learned today that as a result of the conditions of surrender proposed by the Governor of Abyssinia, Aosta, Britain may be able to redeploy several thousand elite British troops and hundreds of aircraft from Abyssinia in the next few days to strengthen the Imperial forces in the Near East. There is great anticipation here for the surrender of this Italian colony and at least 7,000 Italian troops. Military experts here believe that other Italian troops will surrender. Politically, it is hoped that Britain will quickly hand over the recovered territories to the Abyssinian army led by King Selassie, with only a small number of British troops remaining to help maintain order. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Regarding the surrender of Duke Aosta's Italian troops in the Amba Alagi region of Abyssinia, the British only agreed to cease fire from 6:00 PM to 9:15 PM on Friday to discuss the conditions. There is no news yet on the outcome of the negotiations for surrender. The main fortresses of the Italian army in Amba Alagi are now completely surrounded. These fortresses are located on high mountains, rising into the clouds and shrouded in mist, but South African troops and patriotic Abyssinian troops are attacking from the south, and British troops are pressing from the north. The Italian army was completely surrounded on Friday, with the support of British artillery and air forces. At 8:15 AM on the same day, the Italian army showed signs of surrendering, sending several junior officers as representatives to the British lines to discuss the terms of surrender. The British declared that if the officers were indeed speaking on behalf of Duke Aosta, the British would negotiate and ordered a ceasefire from 6:00 PM. If the conditions were not accepted, the artillery fire would resume at 9:15 PM. The details of the negotiations after the ceasefire are not yet known. If Duke Aosta accepts the terms of surrender, the impact will be to demoralize the Italian troops who are still resisting elsewhere. A Reuters military correspondent stated that Aosta's request for surrender does not necessarily mean the end of the war in the area. Aosta, while seeing the futility of continuing resistance in the Amba Alagi region, did not mention the other two centers of Italian resistance: Gonder, southwest of Amba Alagi, and the Lake region, about 200 miles south of the Abyssinian capital. Hitler may have ordered a sustained resistance within the broadest possible range in the area to contain a portion of the British forces, preventing them from being transferred to North Africa to attack Libya. Therefore, Aosta is unlikely to order the Italian troops in Gonder and the Lake region to cease resistance. The exact strength of the Italian forces in the area is currently unknown. A week ago, it was estimated that there were about 33,000 Italian troops and about 36,000 indigenous troops in the area, but there is no official news on their distribution. If a large number of Italian troops are defending Amba Alagi, the surrender of the Italian troops there will quickly end the war in other areas. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent with the vanguard of the British forces near Sollum reported that some of the positions around Sollum captured by the British forces on Thursday have been retaken by the German forces.

However, a certain famous British regiment is still holding positions on the coastal plain near Sollum. The situation on the top of the slopes is unclear. It is believed that the German forces there have retreated before the British vanguard, but the German forces have not completely retaken their old positions. It is reported that the German forces are currently in a position where their right flank is vulnerable to attack. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Darlan Returns to Paris to Reopen Franco-German Negotiations; Parisian Press Urges U.S. President to Mediate Peace Through Negotiations</h3>
<p>Vichy - French Cabinet Associate Darlan returned to Paris yesterday to reopen negotiations for Franco-German cooperation. At the same time, the Parisian press unanimously launched an appeal to President Roosevelt to mediate the European war through negotiated peace. Parisian newspapers under German control declared that as a result of the prestige gained by the United States through increasing the production of war materials, it can effectively dictate the terms for ending the war between Britain and the Axis powers. Editorials in various newspapers stated that France believes that neither side of the belligerents has the strength to launch a decisive offensive. Therefore, a negotiated peace is the only hope for rebuilding Europe. The newspapers pointed out that Roosevelt now has two paths to take: to strive for mediation of the war, with French observers here recognizing President Roosevelt and the Pope as the only qualified figures to mediate, and France is willing to support any peace movement. However, if the war cannot be ended quickly, France will fully cooperate with the Axis to organize a new European economic group, stopping short of military cooperation.

<h3>Germany and Turkey to Sign a Commercial Treaty; Turkish Parliamentarian Sadak Comments on German-Turkish Relations</h3>

In addition, a clearing arrangement is stipulated, and Turkey must repay £45 million (Turkish currency). (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Turkish Parliamentarian Sadak commented on Turkish-German relations in an article in the Akşam newspaper yesterday, stating that Turkey's foreign policy is based on national interests. When the Balkan war broke out, Turkey declared its neutrality. Only defensive measures are taken when the country is not invaded. Turkey's intervention would not benefit Greece and Britain but would only weaken Turkey's defenses. The rapid end of the Balkan war proves that Turkey's judgment was correct. The Balkan war can prove that Germany's sole objective is against Britain, not to fight for victory or to expand the spread of the war. If Germany's purpose is to defeat Turkey, it would only attack Turkey if it needed to, or if it had to pass through Turkish territory to achieve other goals. Therefore, Germany does not need to attack Turkey. Hitler's statement regarding German-Turkish relations is clear evidence. News of Germany attacking the Dardanelles Strait and passing through Turkey to attack Egypt comes from abroad. Currently, both countries are concerned with maintaining peaceful relations.

<h3>Daily Newspaper Attacks: Britain Bans Coconut Kernel Exports to Japan, Claiming Interference with Japanese Food Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers have recently criticized Britain's suspension of coconut kernel exports from the Pacific region, claiming it is an attempt to interfere with Japan's economic lifeline. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" accused the British government of ordering indigenous people of Western Pacific islands not to sell coconut kernels, calling it an "inhumane attempt" to disrupt Japan's food policy. The newspaper reported that the Japanese government had ordered coconut kernels at a price of 100 yen per ton to produce oil and alleviate the shortage of cooking oil in Japan. The paper also stated that the Japanese government was preparing to send special ships to transport the oil, but the British government interfered, angering the indigenous people who depend on selling coconut kernels for their livelihood. The Tokyo government is closely monitoring the outcome of this case. Furthermore, the "Yomiuri Shimbun," in its commentary on the situation in the Near East, stated that Arab troops cooperating with the German army will begin operations throughout the region in an attempt to break free from British control. The newspaper urged the Japanese people to pay attention to the development of the Near East situation, which is closely related to Japan. The newspaper further pointed out that Japan held a superior position in trade in the Near East before the European war, becoming finally independent. Historically, Europeans may consider the Near East as part of Europe, but the region belongs to Asia, and we must not allow it to be ravaged as a playground for Europeans.

Mussolini also warmly praised Pavelic, the leader of the group. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Croatian King: To Be Crowned Soon</p>
<p>Rome – After Prince Aimone of Savoy-Aosta, Duke of Spoleto, was chosen as the King of Croatia, he will prepare to go to Ljubljana within days to hold a coronation ceremony. Croatian Prime Minister Pavelic returned to Croatia by car at 9:30 tonight. Before leaving, he went to the Vatican and met with Pope Pius XII for a discussion lasting twenty minutes. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem – According to reliable information received by Croats responsible for the Middle East, Croatian leader Pavelic has recently agreed with the Nazis to exchange forced labor for materials. Therefore, Croatia has sent 55,000 laborers to Germany to exchange for German substitute goods. This is part of a two-way exchange program. The Croatian side has also stipulated that anyone who prints "seditious" leaflets, secretly sabotages the economy, or incites strikes will be sentenced to death. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Misunderstandings Between Muslims and Britain Resolved, Prince of Hyderabad Writes to Condemn Gailani</h3>
<p>Hyderabad – The Prince of Hyderabad, India, issued an article last night, dispelling the doubts and misunderstandings of Indian Muslims regarding Britain's operations in Iraq, stating: Britain has no intention other than to maintain an extremely friendly relationship with Iraq and to maintain the necessary transportation lines as stipulated in the covenant. It was Ali Gailani, who was inclined to the German side, who seized power, broke the covenant, and attacked the British-owned air force stations, causing the dispute. Britain had to take action for self-defense and for the defense of the transportation lines vital to the defense of India and Egypt. He hopes that Muslims everywhere will understand these facts, avoid misunderstandings, and jointly condemn Ali Gailani. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Random Talks on the European War (5) (6)</p>
<h3>London Fire Account</h3>
<p>So we can only stand on the deserted streets and watch the glass mirror boxes burst and wedding rings melt. This tragedy is even worse than the burning of a church, because the church has pious believers donating money to rebuild it, but no one will care about the shops.</p>
<p>Across the street, a group of people are surging out of the cellar. They are exhausted and look pitiful. Air raid wardens are helping to carry bedding and other items. They stand on the sidewalk with a sense of helplessness. They told Maglie that they were originally in a shelter a quarter of a mile away. But the air raid warden told them that the houses above were on fire, so they had to carry their bedding and pillows to another place. They had only been here for an hour when the air raid warden asked them to move again. This is the third time, where should they go now? Although they are at a loss, no one complains and no one goes crazy.</p>
<p>The air raid wardens are all tough Londoners. Although they are exhausted, they are still indomitable. This kind of tenacious British spirit can be seen all night.</p>
<p>As we walked down a winding street, a gentle breeze blew. At a turn, firefighters lined up in two rows, facing away from us, looking at the waterfall-like flames on the street. From the badges on their collars, I knew they were from the remote countryside of London. Although they shook their heads at Maglie to show that it was not appropriate and warned us to be careful of falling bricks and tiles, they still let us pass. At this time, the wind was getting stronger. Maglie's hair was flying in front of her head, and her skirt was blown up by the wind at her knees. I also pressed down on my hat. Gusts of cold air rushed from the street, driving away millions of cubic feet of heat. This fire was like thousands of chimneys venting, which created this wind.</p>
<p>This row of houses has narrow storefronts but is seven stories high. The fire brutally pounced on us. The heat from a burning house could pass through the walls and set the neighboring house on fire. In the sound of the flames, the sound of breaking glass could be heard continuously, like the sound of drizzling rain.</p>
<p>The wind helped the fire's power, causing the sparks to rise into a red pillar. There is a small church at the end of the street. In the dark square of the church, sparks fell like rain. As it slowly circled down, it created a spectacle I had never seen before in my life.</p>
<p>We ventured deep into the flame-filled street, making the firefighters behind us uneasy. But I knew what they were paying attention to was that Maglie was indeed an extremely beautiful woman. She was not wearing a hat, and her curly golden hair fluttered in the wind. The most pleasing thing about walking with Maglie is that everyone has to turn around and look at her with admiration and respect. She is not the kind of woman that Italians pay attention to, but even Swedes have to turn around and take a look. Moreover, her attitude and demeanor show that she is also brave.</p>
<p>In peaceful times, a woman's bravery is not highly valued. In her life, she may not need to be brave even once. The knowledge of shorthand is ten thousand times more useful. But the war has changed this situation. Bravery has become the best quality of men and women. A person who is not brave will be immediately despised by everyone.</p>
<p>The firefighters looked at Maglie, but Maglie stood on the street in the flames, watching the sparks flying like snowflakes. She shouted, "What a magnificent sight!" I want to cross this fire pit.</p>
<p>I said, "That's not fun!"</p>
<p>Maglie said, "Is it fun to be a firefighter! Is it fun for us to go out tonight! Is it fun to resist almost one hundred million Germans with less than fifty million British people! The only people who are safe and sound in London tonight can be found in the basement of the Lufoia Hotel. Are you coming with me?"</p>
<p>I braced myself and replied: "Okay!"</p>
<p>The driver was touched and suddenly said, "I want to go with you too. This is my hometown. I will never see this situation again." He did not address us as "sir" or "madam," and I was very happy to hear that.</p>
<p>So we ran along the street with flames soaring into the sky. I let Maglie lean on my side to keep her away from the collapsing houses. I held her arm and helped her run over the hot piles of bricks and tiles. The driver no longer followed two steps behind, but chased up and held her other arm.</p>
<p>At that time, the fire was so fierce that I felt that my right cheek was so scorched that oil was about to be extracted. I turned up my coat collar and also turned up Maglie's woolen coat collar with my free hand. The driver also helped on that side, while also paying close attention to her. Flames were coming out of the doors of the shops, like the mouths of stoves. The red and green firelight in the store was flickering and dazzling, and the sparks were falling one after another, but they were embers the size of fingernails. We must quickly put out the sparks, otherwise the coat will be burnt into many small holes.</p>
<p>The explosion sound in the back suddenly turned into a loud noise. We looked back and saw that a five-story building we had just passed had collapsed, piling up several feet high on the sidewalks on both sides. Our retreat was cut off. We had to rush forward through the smoke and fire before the houses in front collapsed and trapped us in the middle.</p>
<p>We walked past the last burning house and ran to the dark little square under the rain of sparks. But our eyes were blinded by the smoke, and we couldn't even see these big sparks. I was afraid that Maglie's hair was in danger of catching fire under the thick sparks, so I pressed my hat on her head. Her eyes were tightly closed, and so were the driver's. I propped up my eyelids with my hands to open one eye. I led them across the square, warning them in advance of the unevenness.</p>
<p>Finally, we arrived at a street that was not on fire and was as dark as漆, and from there we found our way back to where we parked. It was four o'clock in the morning. Maglie decided to go home early, because she had to go to work at 7:30.</p>
<p>Maglie said, "Wasn't the fire beautiful? Weren't those people very nice?"</p>
<p>I have never seen better people.</p>
<p>Maglie said, "These people are really gentle, honest, brave, calm, and have all of them. But now I want to sleep."</p>
<p>So we sent her home, and the driver sent me home. When I paid the fare, he said very seriously that he would not hesitate to miss this opportunity to watch the fire. And he forgot the titles of "sir" or "madam" again.</p>

During this week, the American community holds various social activities, aiming to further strengthen the relationship between the two countries, China and the United States, and to promote the development of trade history.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Grand Banquet to Bid Farewell and Welcome Newcomers</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 19th) at noon, the American Club and the American Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet at the American Club to bid farewell to Colonel Baker, the outgoing commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, who has completed his term of service and is about to return home, and to welcome his successor, Colonel Howard.</p>

<p>The annual "Sino-American Trade Luncheon" for Sino-American businessmen is scheduled to be held from noon to 2 p.m. on Wednesday at the American Club. At that time, prominent figures in the local business community will deliver speeches and read telegrams from Washington and other places.</p>
<p>Small Business Association Celebrates Maritime Day</p>
<p>Thursday is American Maritime Day. The American Small Business Association is scheduled to hold a banquet on this day at the American Club, with Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Navy Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, delivering a speech. A film that has never been shown in Shanghai before will also be screened to add to the entertainment.

This banquet is hosted by the American Alumni Association and the American Women's Alumni Association. Those who wish to reserve a seat must notify the secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce in advance (telephone number 1-742).</p>
<p>Held for Seven Years</p>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in the United States and in other countries has been commemorating National Overseas Trade Day for the seventh time this year. The first event was initiated by the American Chamber of Commerce in 1935. At that time, a total of 300 organizations participated in the commemoration, and the number has greatly increased since then. Overseas Trade Week is always held in the third week of May, so that Maritime Day on May 22nd is included in this week. Maritime Day was established by the U.S. Congress to commemorate the departure of the first American steamship in May 1819.</p>
<p>Promote Future Trade Development</p>
<p>The purpose of this year's Trade Week is to promote public attention to the problems currently encountered in American foreign trade, the necessary measures to safeguard American foreign trade in the current and future unstable world situation, and its contribution to American defense. In Shanghai, the American Chamber of Commerce (a member of the American Chamber of Commerce) hosts the commemoration of this week every year, renaming it Sino-American Trade Week.</p>
<p>Two Types of Government Bonds; Principles of Fundraising</p>
<p>The government bond fundraising committee is promoting two types of government bonds: (1) the 29th-year military expenditure government bond, which can be purchased directly with legal tender; and (2) the 29th-year construction fund government bond, which is specially allowed to be purchased by converting legal tender. The conversion method is based on the exchange rate stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. As for the fundraising methods, the committee has also determined that both persuasion and allocation will be used. In cities, the principle of fair allocation will be adopted, while in rural areas, the principle of voluntary subscription will be adopted. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the fundraising work, each city should establish a review committee, and invite relevant authorities and people familiar with local conditions to be members of the committee to preside over the implementation of fair allocation.</p>
<p>Private Industries; Loans Approved</p>
<p>The four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have been ordered by the head office to expand the handling of loans for private industries in order to assist the development of private industries. Although the total amount of industrial loans in the past has reached 100 million yuan, it has been biased towards state-owned enterprises. In the future, both state-owned and private industries will be given equal importance. Those who apply for loans, regardless of the amount, will be granted loans as appropriate according to actual needs. The collateral for private loans includes: (1) industrial products such as metals, cotton yarn, cloth, dyes, cement, chemical raw materials, and silk fabrics; (2) mineral products such as coal, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, tungsten sand, manganese, antimony, iron sand, copper, iron, and tin; and (3) agricultural products such as rice, wheat, grains, flour, cotton, vegetable oil, peanuts, sesame, soybeans, silkworm cocoons, tea, salt, sugar, medicinal herbs, wood, paper, tobacco, pig bristles, and leather. However, it is stipulated that the mortgage of daily necessities of the people is related to hoarding and speculation, so special caution should be exercised and time limits should be imposed to avoid affecting people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Chinese Students in the U.S. Promote Aid to China</p>
<p>American young students are very sympathetic to China and are very interested in the study of Chinese issues. Chinese students from famous universities such as Pennsylvania, Columbia, Harvard, and Missouri have recently decided, with the consent of the North American and South American Chinese Student Associations, to depart separately during the summer vacation of this year to give lectures in various schools to promote publicity. The topics include the current situation in China, the study of methods to aid China, etc. In addition, the "Young Friends of China Association," organized by American youths who sympathize with China, has hired Chinese students studying in the United States to give lectures in New York. This move will surely make a great contribution to promoting American aid to China.</p>
<h3>Japanese Arrest Attempt in Beijing Apartments on Rue Paul Beau</h3>
<p>Chen Wannian, a 30-year-old Cantonese man, took his wife and two children to live in Room 5 of the Beijing Apartments at No. 439, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, on January 23 this year. On April 27, he moved to Room 27 on the second floor. Chen suddenly moved his family away on the 15th of this month. Unexpectedly, at about 4 a.m. yesterday, five plainclothes Japanese personnel suddenly went to the apartment with personnel from the French Concession police to arrest Chen. However, Chen had already left, so they failed to arrest him. Subsequently, the Japanese personnel and detectives searched the room where Chen had lived until about 5 a.m. before leaving.</p>
<h3>City-Wide Publicity Yesterday; Automobile Noise Reduction Campaign; Do Not Listen to Radio in Private Cars; To Avoid Distracting Drivers</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Police Department and Traffic Department of the Public Concession believe that automobile drivers often like to honk their horns indiscriminately, the purpose of which is nothing more than to make other vehicles and pedestrians on the road give way, in order to increase speed. However, it is very disruptive to the work, rest, and sleep of citizens. Because the noise is disruptive, it can indirectly distract people's minds, so it has always been strictly forbidden to honk horns indiscriminately near hospitals and schools in order to ensure</p>
<p>Public Tranquility</p>
<p>Now, in conjunction with the French Concession authorities, the "Campaign to Eliminate Automobile Horn Noise Propaganda Week" will be launched from the 100th. It has also been found that many new cars have wireless radio equipment. In the past, some people even advocated installing wireless radios in public buses to benefit passengers and reduce their loneliness. At that time, the Public Utility Committee believed that this kind of measure, while the vehicle is running,</p>
<p>Distracts Pedestrians</p>
<p>And is easy to distract, and will indirectly increase the incidence of vehicle accidents, so it was rejected. It also advises those who have wireless radio equipment in their private cars not to listen to it. The intention is purely for public order and to reduce traffic obstructions and unfortunate incidents. It is now heard that this campaign will continue until the 26th. After the end of the propaganda campaign, the promotion work will not stop. After the implementation yesterday, radio stations and cinemas also widely publicized it. The horn noise has indeed been greatly reduced. The police are also instructing drivers at any time. If anyone honks the horn indiscriminately, they will record the number and give a warning. It is still hoped that all car owners and drivers will continue to assist the police and the public, so that this summer</p>
<p>Those who sleep with windows open</p>
<p>Can get sufficient rest at night, and those who work during the day can also avoid unnecessary harassment. The reporter learned from the Public Concession's General Traffic Department that large white flags are hung in the following places, with the words "Do Not Honk Horns Indiscriminately" in red, with advertisements for Samsung toothpaste and Riri soap on both sides. It is heard that there are a total of 30 such large flags, donated by the China Chemical Industry Society and the China-West Drugstore. It is heard that there are five locations in the Northern District, with one such large flag hung at each location, with the words "Do Not Honk Horns Indiscriminately" in Chinese, English, and Japanese. There are also</p>
<p>40,000 Leaflets</p>
<p>Donated by the Niuliguo Milk Powder Company. Starting yesterday, the police at various intersections in both concessions distributed various leaflets to the drivers, urging them not to honk their horns too much, and sent large horns to major car dealerships to reduce the noise for free. It is expected that this unprecedented noise reduction campaign will be warmly assisted by all sectors.</p>
<p>Launch a General Cleaning</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has gradually become hot. In order to promote the health of citizens, a sanitation campaign has been launched. A general cleaning will be held starting today. All shops should clean the inside of the house and in front of the door separately to keep it clean.</p>
<h3>Number of Rice Ships Doubles; Foreign Rice Prices Plummet; Rice Shops Sell Hong Kong Rice with Wooden Signs; Public Works Department Hopes Citizens Will Buy Affordable Rice</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's announcement, all rice shops that sell the bureau's foreign rice have a wooden sign at the entrance, with the words "This store sells the Public Works Department's foreign rice, today's market price is 110 yuan per stone" in Chinese and English (see attached photo), in order to indicate that each rice shop has agreed to sell foreign rice in accordance with the bureau's regulations. It is hoped that citizens will assist the bureau in purchasing this rice from each rice shop.</p>
<p>All Rice Shops Selling Must Register</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Liki Foreign Firm, upon receiving instructions from the Public Works Department, customized a registration form for each rice shop selling Hong Kong rice, containing six items: (1) store name, (2) address, (3) license number, (4) average monthly rice sales in 1940, (5) foreign rice sold by the Public Works Department today, and (6) signature of the store owner. The Liki Foreign Firm has completed the processing of this registration form, with a total of more than 700 copies, which were sent to the Public Works Department for review yesterday afternoon and should be distributed to each rice shop today. Each book contains 60 pages of forms and is numbered, enough for each rice shop to use for two months. It is reported that each rice shop will send the completed forms to the Liki Foreign Firm every week for reference.</p>
<p>Weight Refund to Start Next Week</p>
<p>A total of 743 local firms ordered the first batch of Hong Kong rice. As of yesterday, more than 570 firms had paid Xianmao Foreign Firm, and there are still more than 170 firms, which are expected to be completed within this week. As for the rice shops that go to the warehouse to pick up the goods, if the weight of a small number of them is less than 224 pounds, they should bring the weight slip to Xiangmao Foreign Firm for a refund. The foreign firm has not yet completed the payment procedures, so the weight refund procedure will start next Monday. Each rice shop can keep the weight slip and go for a refund next Monday.</p>
<p>The Source of Foreign Rice is Increasing</p>
<p>Since the two concession authorities actively dredged the source of foreign rice, the number of rice ships has increased. The production prices in foreign rice producing areas such as Saigon, Siam, and Yangon have fallen sharply, and the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai from various domestic rice producing areas has increased. In the past month, the average daily amount of rice shipped to Shanghai has been more than 20,000 bags. The rice stock has recently increased to more than 2.2 million bags. According to rice industry news yesterday, the transaction volume has been quite large compared to the past due to the low price of foreign rice. The Sarrant ship, managed by the Zhuanghualun Foreign Firm, carrying 25,000 bags of tribute rice, is expected to arrive in port today. It is said that it is part of the first batch of low-priced rice ordered by the French Concession Public Works Bureau from Vietnam, but the French side has not yet confirmed it.</p>
<p>Rice Weevils Raise Rice Prices</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Department handled the sale of Hong Kong rice, rice prices have plummeted. According to statistics, the highest foreign rice has fallen from 165 yuan per bag to 111 yuan in half a month, a huge drop of 54 yuan. The authorities' main purpose of suppressing rice prices has been achieved, but the general rice weevils are all panicked, fearing that the Public Works Department's foreign rice will become more and more, so they have been trying to sell it off in recent days. However, the market is full of spot goods, and no one cares, so their embarrassment can be imagined. Who knows, yesterday, they tried to reverse the decline again, using the excuse that Yongdi was purchasing from Shanghai, and some people even attempted to smuggle it out of the country for domestic sales. Rice prices were arbitrarily raised by 4 or 5 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rose from 111 yuan to 116 yuan, and Xiaojiaomi rose from 103 yuan to 107 yuan.</p>
<p>A Flash in the Pan Has No Impact</p>
<p>It is reported that this phenomenon is a flash in the pan, because the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice is determined by the authorities, and the rise and fall of the market price has no impact on it. If the rice weevils raise the price, then residents can buy the Public Works Department's foreign rice. Moreover, the quantity of the Public Works Department's foreign rice sold by each rice shop must be registered daily, so it will not flow into the hands of hoarders. Therefore, the reactionary situation of rice prices yesterday is nothing more than a last gasp. It is also reported that various factories and firms in this city can order the Public Works Department's foreign rice from the Liki Foreign Firm.</p>

<p>Commercial Press Employees are Being Laid Off</p>
<p>The long-standing dispute at the Commercial Press has resulted in the management publishing notices in various newspapers yesterday about the dismissal and transfer of employees. The employees' representatives are currently convening an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday, they were running around trying to open the door for negotiations in order to avoid adverse consequences. In the afternoon, representatives were sent to Li Bojia's private residence to request a meeting, but it was unsuccessful. The representatives decided that if employees receive any kind of notice from the company, they should hand it over to the representatives for centralized handling.</p>
<p>Sullivan Labor Dispute Remains Stalled</p>
<p>Sullivan Confectionery Company laid off employees for no reason, which caused dissatisfaction among all employees, and finally announced a joint strike, which has lasted for a week. Yesterday, the management held a board meeting and reviewed the 12 conditions proposed by the labor side, but has not yet made a concrete expression to the labor side. As for the labor side, in order to prepare for any eventuality, a representative meeting was held at 8 p.m. last night. The opinions of the people at the meeting were unanimous, and it was decided that if the management still does not express goodwill, they will fight to the end and hope that all sectors will give sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Hair Salon Dispute Arises from Breach of Contract</p>

Go-slow action began on the 17th. The labor side has appealed to the relevant parties for assistance. Currently, the attitude of the management is quite tough and they firmly refuse to fulfill the contract. The dispute is currently stalled.</p>

<h3>President Taft Returns; Changes Stop to Yokohama</h3>
<p>The American President Lines resumed round-trip voyages on the President Taft on the 11th of this month and changed the itinerary. The ship will sail from the United States without stopping at Kobe or Yokohama, Japan, and go directly to Shanghai, then sail to Hong Kong and Manila. On the return trip from Manila, it will stop at Kobe via Hong Kong and Shanghai and return to the United States, only stopping at Kobe and not Yokohama. It was reported earlier that the President Taft, which first resumed round-trip voyages, is now on its return trip from Manila. It was originally scheduled to arrive in port today, but it was delayed on the way to Shanghai due to encountering wind, so the trip from Manila to Shanghai must also be delayed.

<p>Trolleybuses 17 and 18, which run between the French and Public Concessions' Xieqiao and the North Railway Station, are operated by French merchants on Route 18 and by British merchants on Route 17. At about 9 p.m. the night before, when Trolleybus 346 of Route 17, operated by British merchants, arrived at the station at the intersection of Laixide Road, Caishi Road, French Concession, the fare inspector No. 38 of the French Tram Company boarded the bus and found that the passenger had purchased fewer tickets, pointing out that the conductor No. 958 in the bus was cheating and skimming. The two sides initially had a verbal conflict, then resorted to violence and beat each other. The trolleybus stopped in the middle of the road. The vehicles behind were all blocked, and it caused dissatisfaction among all the conductors on the British merchants' buses, who all abandoned their jobs and went on strike. The French police received the information and sent detectives to the scene, detaining the fare inspector No. 38 and the conductor No. 958 in the police station. Until yesterday morning, the vehicles of Route 17 of the British merchants stopped driving into the French Concession because the arrested workers had not been released, and the vehicles of Route 18 of the French merchants also did not drive into the British Concession.

<h3>Owner of Tao Tao Sock Factory Accused of Bigamy - Abandoning His Wife to Marry a Prostitute, First Wife Works as a Helper and Reports to Police for Justice</h3>
<p>Tao Zikang, 34 years old, a native of Shaoxing and currently the owner of the Tao Tao Sock Factory under the Mao Xing Transportation Company, residing at 175 Rue Cardinal, was originally poor. Sixteen years ago, he took Sun Fuying (35 years old), also from Shaoxing, as his wife. They had one daughter, now 15 years old, and adopted a son, now 9 years old.</p>
<p>Jobless and Destitute</p>
<p>After the Shanghai War, Tao came to Shanghai with Sun, initially living at the home of a friend, Mr. Li, at 20 Shou'an Lane, Baixian Bridge. This Mr. Li ran an escort agency at the Far Eastern Hotel. Because Tao was unemployed at the time, Li had him work as an accountant at the agency. Wang Ying, a prostitute at the agency, developed feelings for Tao due to their daily interactions, and they became lovers. Once Tao found this new love, he drove his wife, Sun Fuying, out of the house. Sun, left with little choice, worked as a helper to make a living.</p>
<p>From Poor to Rich</p>
<p>After Tao became lovers with Wang Ying (real name Yang Yuying), he became acquainted with a certain magnate through connections. At the time, Shanghai was experiencing a shortage of ham, and prices were soaring. With the help of this magnate, Tao transported three ships of ham from Hangzhou to Shanghai, becoming an overnight success. He specialized in the transportation business, going from modest prosperity to wealth. He then invested in and opened the Tao Tao Sock Factory, etc.</p>
<p>Love the New, Discard the Old</p>
<p>In order to reward Yang Yuying for her efforts, he formally married Yang at the Yi Pin Xiang Hotel on March 13th of this year, with Mr. Wen Lanting as the officiant. Famous opera singers performed all day at the wedding reception. He never once thought about how his first wife was living under someone else's roof, working as a helper to make a living. Unexpectedly, Sun found out about this and collected evidence to report to the Huishi Police Station.</p>
<p>Accused of Bigamy</p>
<p>After investigation, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun learned that Tao was hosting a banquet at the Lianxiang Brothel, 19 Huile Lane. He then ordered Chinese Detective Huang Fusen, Detective Liang Yuliang, and Officer Yang Xichen to go there and arrest Tao, who was then sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, charged him with bigamy. Tao hired lawyer Qian Zheng to defend him. Tao denied marrying Sun Fuying, only admitting to being lovers with her. After questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzi, Tao was detained and a new hearing date was set.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Grain: A Centipede Dies Hard - Speculators Attempt a Comeback - Shipping to Ningbo Area Hoping for Doubled Profits - Rice Prices Rise Another Five, Seven, or Eight Yuan from Previous Day - A Reader Sends a Letter Requesting Sample Rice Display</h3>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Jiaying wheel brought 21,004 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council imported rice from Hong Kong. The Yuezhou also brought 4,302 bags of imported rice. Both wheels arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 18th) and berthed at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng wheel also arrived the day before yesterday (the 18th), bringing 10,000 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council imported rice, berthing at the Weissfuh Wharf for unloading. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai, also transporting 10,000 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for imported rice was invigorated by Ningbo merchants, who could obtain doubled profits in the Ningbo area. The market atmosphere immediately became tense, and all imported rice merchants were thriving. The dispirited mood of brokers and agents for several days suddenly changed to a lively smile. The price of rice had plummeted for days, dropping by 40 to 50 yuan. Major merchants and wealthy households still had rice stored from last year's low prices. Even with the higher prices, their costs were still less than 100 yuan. A drop of 40 to 50 yuan was not a concern. However, general speculators and those with insufficient capital had seen their assets vanish and were in dire straits. Therefore, they were still trying to salvage their situation in a final struggle, seeking a way out and waiting for an opportunity. Real consumers and new buyers were also quietly waiting for the opportunity to arrive. Now that the market price has fallen below the Shanghai Municipal Council's standard and reached a certain point, they immediately began buying. Ningbo merchants had the greatest appetite, buying five or six thousand yuan. Other inland merchants also bought three or four thousand bags. Local businesses also added to their purchases, and new speculators joined in. The market price rose immediately, then steadily increased. Small Jiaoxi rice opened at 105 yuan, then increased from 5 jiao to 1 yuan, reaching 109 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rose from 113 yuan to 117 yuan. Min Dang rose from 105 yuan to 110 yuan. Mi Lu 87 yuan, broken rice 81.25 yuan. Yinghua Si original bags were popular, broken rice 99 yuan to 100 yuan, April-May 99 yuan to 102 yuan, Small Jiaoxi April-May 133 yuan, Saigon 136.5 yuan to 138 yuan, an increase of 5, 7, or 8 yuan compared to last weekend. The after-hours market even tightened by another one or two yuan, with 20,000 bags of spot rice changing hands, Yinghua Si 1,500 to 1,600 tons.</p>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter from a reader yesterday saying: I want to tell the truth. Despite my financial difficulties, I still subscribe to the Shen Bao and the ×× Daily. I read the Shen Bao for its editorials and the "Sixty Years Ago" stories. When the delivery person occasionally replaces it with the ×× newspaper, I insist on no substitution. If I miss a day, I still need to get a replacement. And if I want to understand everything about... and its little anecdotes, I subscribe to the ×× Daily. Now I have a recent matter to ask you to answer:</p>
<p>(1) The name newspaper focuses its criticism on unscrupulous merchants, but the Shen Bao's editorials are ironic and mocking, allowing one to understand the meaning implicitly. The Shanghai Municipal Council, under the urging of public opinion, did obtain Hong Kong rice. However, at the crucial moment, it still left room for maneuver. Does the gentleman know this? I remember that in the gentleman's Shen Bao editorial, there was a proposal to display rice samples in glass cases in front of the store so that buyers could make comparisons. This is an essential measure.</p>
<p>(2) Now that it is time to implement this measure, there is absolutely no mention of this essential measure. The so-called "one yuan one jiao" rice in the rice shops is easily the most inferior rice, and the rice that is truly obtained from Hong Kong becomes just another way for unscrupulous merchants to make more money. If there is such a fickle behavior, then the measures originally intended to stabilize society cannot be carried out to the end and become something regrettable and hateful.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, at the final crucial moment (i.e., when selling), strict supervision should be carried out. Those who only seek profit, like the wicked beggars who catch snakes and frogs, should be condemned in writing and speech. Those who sincerely want to stabilize society, like Guang Sheng, are like the old women who buy and release snakes and frogs. Based on past events, I have this worry. I hope I am wrong. I respectfully hope that the gentleman will also pay attention to this to avoid failure at the last step.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: I have seen that the rice shops in the French Concession have labeled each rice box, clearly stating the price. Although there are no rice samples on display, it is more complete than simply hanging a paper sign. Buyers can easily compare the rice samples and prices displayed by each rice shop, which reduces the possibility of rice merchants deceiving customers. This is an easy thing to do, and the Public Concession could easily imitate it. If sample rice display can be done, it will not only benefit customers but also eliminate the mixing of inferior rice.</p>
<p>Thick and Thin Geng Rice and other domestic rice are rarely available. Now that imported rice is rising again, the owners' minds are firm, shouting for higher prices. At the same time, the local shops' appetites are also strong, and the market is recovering accordingly. The prices of both thick and thin rice have recovered to the early prices of the previous week. Wuxi White Geng is quoted at 135 yuan, Kun Geng at 132 yuan to 130 yuan, South Hongzao (early) and late rice initially opened at 128 to 129 yuan, later reaching 132 yuan, original bags 135 yuan, a rebound of 2 to 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Although glutinous rice has also gradually risen, it is difficult to compete with other goods due to its limited sales. The price has only increased by one or two yuan. Hong Kong white opened at 110 yuan, 109 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour: Active Sales</h3>
<p>The foreign flour market, after a sharp drop last week, opened yesterday with a good situation. Due to the active sales of Yantai merchants and the rebound of rice prices, people were quite hopeful for higher prices for a while. Many local speculators took this opportunity to buy. Jinlong brand Kan flour jumped to the 30 yuan mark, a sharp increase of 1.4 yuan compared to last week's low price. The Pao Tai brand American flour also broke the 30 yuan mark, reaching 30.05 yuan. However, the market soon loosened, because the rise was too rapid and the sales were hesitant. Therefore, Jinlong flour returned slightly to 29.5 yuan in the afternoon, and Pao Tai flour also rose sharply and retreated quickly. As a result, it rose by 7 or 8 jiao compared to last week. Flower, Bird, Clock Tower flour and Caishen brand, etc., also tightened by about half a yuan. A total of 25,000 to 26,000 bags were traded in the city. The flat-selling flour from the Chinese factories remained unchanged, while the retail price of the factory's Lao Che brand was 33.5 yuan per bag, and Bingchuan and Fuxin brand were 31.5 yuan per bag. Flat-selling goods are not included in this category. Wheat had no market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Fluctuate Greatly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes continued the potential of the previous weekend. Rumors of rising rice prices caused unrest. Various market prices continued to rise. Soybean oil rose by four or five yuan (price details in the market price column). 120 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, 100 dan of Daya Oil, peanut oil also increased by two yuan in the limited purchase and sale (opened 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil), yellow soybeans were sluggish. Although the oil mills and local markets inquired, they would not buy unless it was cheap. Therefore, the market atmosphere remained undeveloped. Yesterday, the factories sold over 1,000 bags of Guide soybeans and over 300 bags of Tianjin soybeans. Corn was the opposite of the previous situation, with a strong buying momentum. The market price rose sharply by about 3 yuan compared to Saturday, but it fell back slightly at the close. 3,000 bags of spot goods were opened, and 200 tons of futures. The soybean cake "kick the ball" transaction was very popular, with many fluctuations throughout the day. The market price fluctuated greatly. The Shin Kee spot cake was opened at 2,000 pieces (March warehouse receipt), and the futures cake was over 20,000 pieces. The market was 19.5 yuan for the April 15th warehouse receipt ordered to be delivered in the lower May, and the May lower warehouse receipt ordered to be delivered in the upper June ranged from 21.5 yuan to 5.5 jiao, turned down to 0.075 jiao, and then increased to 1.12 jiao. Such sudden ups and downs were dazzling. The final closing price was 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Spot and Futures Even</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday. The HSBC listed prices for various exchanges remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchanges showed hardening for the June American dollar, with the remaining trend sluggish and stable. The rumors of the United States mediating the Sino-Japanese war caused Chinese speculators to supply. The gold price also fell, making 5.375 yuan difficult to sell. The price was sluggish in the afternoon due to limited transactions. Finally, only the June American dollar was longer at 0.03125, at 5.375 yuan, which was cheaper than the spot price. The remaining prices and the British exchange were even. Transactions were sparse.</p>
<p>The Situation is Stabilized and Stable</p>
<p>Since the morning, the foreign news from the silver market showed that the British and American were closed, and Indian silver was slightly reduced. The international exchange rate of British to Shanghai was longer at 0.03125, with the remainder flat. The bank's selling price for the opening of the domestic market was 3 shillings and 2.8125 pence for the spot British exchange, and 5.34375 yuan for the American dollar, the same as the closing price of the previous day.

The silver balance tax was still 24.50%. The June 5.375 yuan was difficult to sell and could be closed. Near noon, a certain foreign bank entered 15,000 US dollars for June 5.375 yuan, which was supplied by the money changers and returned to even, but soon loosened again to be closed. The market closed with the spot British exchange still at 3 shillings and 2.8125 pence, and the American dollar spot and May at 5.34375 yuan, June at 5.375 yuan, 0.03125 longer than the close of the June American dollar last Saturday.

<h3>The Gold Market Has Downward Potential - Spot Goods Uniquely Increased</h3>
<p>The gold market's black market yesterday. The variability was still weak. The overall situation was downward. There were rumors that the Soviet Union commented that the Japanese side needed the United States to mediate the war, which was even more urgent. The distant month American exchange rate tended to loosen, causing the firmness and high prices around last weekend's noon closing to be weakened by all parties. Although HSBC Shinfong Yong still aggressively increased its position, the supply from securities and silver firms was more than the demand, and retail investors all had a short mentality. The price retreated from 6,470 yuan at the morning opening to 6,432 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, Deda Gold Store aggressively entered, slightly saving the downward trend, closing at 6,450 yuan, again 13 yuan less. Compared to last weekend's closing price, it was 30 yuan less. A total of 30,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Cash gradually increased. HSBC Shinfong Yong sold 90 taels, the price was 130 yuan higher than the futures delivery price.

(May turned to June swap, the seller posted 55 yuan to the buyer in the afternoon, and dozens of taels were traded.)</p>
<p>Smelted Gold Decreased 13 Yuan</p>
<p>The June futures opened at 9:15 AM, for 6,470 yuan, 7 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon closing. Yida and Yu Tai Fung came to sell, and it immediately retreated to 6,450 yuan. Chengji, Chengda, and Xinyuan came to enter, raising it to 6,470 yuan, sold by Tong Kang Yong and Heng Ji Lianxing. Then it was suppressed again. The news that the June US dollar of 5.375 yuan could be settled also caused Yili, Yida, Rencheng and Yong to sell, dropping to 6,442 yuan. Shinfong Yong and Defu absorbed it. The noontime was slightly pulled up, and noon closed at 6,451 yuan, 47-48 yuan after closing. In the peaceful atmosphere in the afternoon, the price continued to fall. The opening at 2:00 PM was 6,435 yuan, 16 yuan lower than the noon closing. Under the selling pressure of various households, it fell to 6,432 yuan. Yida, Tong Kang Yong, Dafeng, and Heng Ji came to buy, and slowly rose to 6,445 yuan. Chengji and Shinfong Yong sold, retreating twice to 6,432 yuan. Deda bought, and retail shorts also absorbed it.

<h3>Gold Pound Uniquely Rises 2 Yuan</h3>

British gold bills tended to soften slightly. American gold bills opened at 0.35 yuan, retreated to 0.28 yuan, and finally closed at 8.3 yuan, a fall of 3 fen compared to last week.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Slightly Strengthened in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The public bond black market yesterday. The market situation was extremely peaceful in the morning. It was slightly improved in the afternoon due to news. It was rumored that Japan persuaded the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, but the United States denied this. This kind of rumor shows that it is a one-sided wishful thinking, too far from the facts. The impact on the market was also very limited. The reason why public bonds increased by 2 to 3 jiao was also a part of the buying. The old bulls took the opportunity to come out again, still no more than a maneuvering situation. Tong Kang and Dechang bought in the morning, Jiu Cheng, Yong Fu, and Lianhe sold, and the market price was stable, without much difference. In the afternoon, Lianhe widely bought, and fifty0,000 of the C bond penetrated the 6 yuan mark again. Defu, Tong Kang, Lianyi, and Yongchang supplied, and Yichang and Qianyi still sold, bought by Dechang and Yizhong. The market situation was still a maneuvering and soft trend. As a result, it unanimously returned to good, increasing by 1.5 to 5 jiao, with a turnover of about 2.2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading, the championship stock was 50 garden stocks, priced at 90 yuan. The foreign stock market situation of the Public Association was still in an unremarkable process. The trading was sluggish, and the price was only slightly up or down compared to last week.</p>
<p>The British Zeng Paper Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend as of the end of June 1942, which is 2 jiao 5 fen per share in national currency.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales Remain as Dull as Before, Yarn Market Declines</h3>
<p>The yarn market is spiraling downwards because actual transactions are not progressing at all, leading to discouragement. However, wealthy firms are absorbing large quantities and firmly holding onto them, so despite large-scale selling by the "Gold Gang" and securities firms, there is a lack of actual goods for delivery. Therefore, the bulls are taking advantage of this point to tighten their grip, not only not releasing positions during declines but instead adding to them, supporting the market on the surface. However, in terms of the overall environment, the market is not optimistic. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn reached a high price of 1,485 yuan and a low price of 1,464 yuan. In the early afternoon, it initially traded at 1,465 yuan, then fell to 1,460 yuan, rebounded to 1,470 yuan, and the final price was 1,469 yuan.</p>
<p>"Double Horse" opened strong in the morning, with bullish sentiment still tight. The opening price was 1,483 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,485 yuan. However, at this 500 yuan level, new buyers were scarce, and long-term holders began to sell, slightly loosening the supply of shares, causing it to weaken to 1,474 yuan. But some scalpers came back to buy and cover short positions, pushing it up again to 1,481 yuan. Unexpectedly, actual sales remained as dull as ever, prices of miscellaneous brands did not rise, and sellers were more numerous, leading to a further decline to 1,464 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 1,469 yuan. The total trading volume for the half-day was 13,130 bales. The amounts bought by various groups are listed separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Fine Cotton Mills Show Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>The raw cotton situation remains as stagnant as ever, and mill demand is not strong. However, there is a growing interest in fine cotton of suitable quality. Industry sentiment is still good. Taicang cotton is priced at 215 yuan, with slight transactions reported.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Price Fluctuations Depend on Actual Sales Volume</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market fluctuated, and the trend remained weak. However, cloth prices varied depending on actual sales volume. White coarse cloth was the strongest. Ewo Factory's heavy and light weight materials (rose in price by (every bolt) 2.5 jiao, coarse twill remained flat, fine twill fell 2.5 jiao, and fine cloth fell about 5 jiao. Runcang and Ewo Factory's bleached and dyed cloth remained firm, while other goods generally fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao. The street traded over 500 pieces of various cloths, mostly coarse cloth and coarse twill. Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants purchased several hundred pieces of Ewo and Runcang Factory's bleached and dyed coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Customer sales are declining daily, and the market continues to soften. Futures of middle-grade fine cloth fell (per bolt) 3 to 5 jiao. The spot market also fell about 5 jiao due to weak demand for middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill. However, top-grade "Dragon Head" fine cloth factory orders still require 47.6 yuan in the after-market closing price. Four Gentlemen Drill is priced at 1.48875 yuan.</p>
<h3>Panic Falling Prices for Pallicis are Especially Severe</h3>
<p>Recently, items such as Pallicis, feather woolen cloth, Wanliding, Fat Skin, and Baleen have all been experiencing declines. The price drop of Pallicis is especially severe. Although the actual sales of Baleen, Fat Skin, Wanliding, and feather woolen cloth are good, the inventory is quite high. Moreover, it is now approaching the Dragon Boat Festival, and the sales season is already halfway over. Buyer demand is not as strong as it was last month, and sellers have relatively abundant stock compared to other items. If orders are delayed, they must be stored for another ten months. The future of the maritime woolen market and domestic and international situations ten months from now are difficult to predict. Therefore, everyone is willing to actively lower prices for the aforementioned goods, and prices are declining accordingly. In addition to the above reasons, Pallicis production from factories has been continuous, with Shifeng, Yuanfeng, Zhanghua, Hualun, and Shanghai all producing, leading to an even weaker trend, with a tendency to become cheaper as prices fall.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Futures for Coarse White Sugar Rise by 7 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the sugar market was closed due to the settlement date for coarse white sugar futures on the 20th. In the afternoon, only trading in coarse white sugar futures for the end of the month occurred, and the trend was flat, initially firm then weakening, with little fluctuation. The guild's settlement price for coarse white sugar futures at the end of May initially rose several jiao, to 108.5, .2, .8, .8.1 yuan, then softened and slightly declined several jiao to 107.9, .6, .7, .5, .6, .5, .4, .3, .2, .1, .2 yuan, and closed at 7.3 yuan, down 7 jiao from the previous day. On the 19th, a ship arrived from Hong Kong carrying 15,350 bales.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Demand for 35-Pound Tinplate Gradually Emerging from Factories</h3>
<p>Thirty-five pound tinplate, which has been quiet for a long time, saw factories begin to take action yesterday. However, sales to customer merchants remain sluggish, so transactions are still rare. This product is divided into 14x20 inch and 20x28 inch sizes, with each box containing 175 sheets and 195 sheets respectively. The weight per box is 105 pounds and 118 pounds (the number of sheets for 14x20 inches is doubled, but the weight is the same). In the past, this product was imported only from the United Kingdom and the United States. However, recently, British goods have disappeared, and there is concern that American goods will also become unavailable. Therefore, industry sentiment is still strong due to the thin inventory in the market. Yesterday's selling price was still 750 yuan per box, and there was concern that no goods could be purchased. It is reported that only about 20 boxes were sold throughout the city yesterday. Its primary use is for the thin lids of cigarette tins, followed by biscuit tins and paint tins.</p>

<p>Academic Lecture</p>
<h3>How to Study Paintings (I)</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>I. Why Study Paintings?</p>
<p>Before discussing how to study paintings, we must first ask why we study paintings and what its purpose is. Once we understand this, discussing the study will be more interesting. We know that paintings are art, and art can inspire great talent and cultivate character. The purpose of education is nothing more than to seek knowledge and cope with the environment. In addition to rational and utilitarian considerations, it should also inspire talent and cultivate virtue, and paintings are the best tool for inspiration and cultivation. For example, natural science is too dry, so we use the appreciation of paintings to adjust our mental depression. Reason is too realistic, so we use the power of paintings to escape the shackles of utilitarianism. Therefore, great philosophers, great scientists, great politicians, and great writers, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, all have artistic cultivation and the nourishment of paintings. Newton, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Tagore, Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, Zhuang Tzu, as well as Wang Weimojie and Su Dongpo, all studied paintings, allowing their outstanding talents to be fully developed, their sharp thoughts to be purely tempered, and their great undertakings to be precisely accomplished. To put it more narrowly, general subjects are either biased towards using the brain or the hands, but studying paintings involves observing objects, describing outlines, applying colors, and distinguishing between beauty and ugliness, using both the "brain" and the "hands" at the same time, and combining thought and action in a comprehensive way, which can achieve dual effects. As for painters who study for life, inspiring humanity with art, promoting politics and religion, and passing on their names to future generations, such as Leonardo and Raphael in the Western Renaissance, Ingres in the 19th century, and Wu Daozi in the Tang Dynasty, Dong Beiyuan in the Song Dynasty, Ni Yunlin in the Yuan Dynasty, Tang Bohu in the Ming Dynasty, and Wang Shigu in the Qing Dynasty, the examples are too numerous to mention, all of whom are experts in their fields.</p>
<p>II. What is the Content of Paintings?</p>
<p>Now that we understand the purpose of studying paintings, the second step is to understand the content of paintings. The world's painting systems can be divided into two: one is the Eastern painting system, and the other is the Western painting system. The Western painting system sprouted and grew on the Italian Peninsula in Europe, branched out to other parts of Europe, and in the last one or two centuries, it has been transplanted to various federations in the Americas and spread to East Asia at the same time. The Eastern painting system originated in mainland China, and on the one hand, it was influenced by West Asia and India, undergoing considerable changes, and then it spread to Japan via Korea. For thousands of years, Eastern and Western paintings have developed their own national characteristics, customs, and habits, and each has its own achievements. In recent centuries, due to the development of transportation, a phenomenon of mutual harmony has arisen. Now, separating from the content and form, I will say, one, Chinese paintings are divided into figure paintings (including Buddha statues, portraits of ladies, etc.), landscape paintings (including landscape, travelogue characters, scenery, etc.), sketch paintings (including flowers, birds, fish, insects, and animals, etc.), and miscellaneous paintings (including historical figure paintings, wall paintings, etc.). Before the Tang Dynasty, there were only figure paintings. Landscape paintings were invented after the Tang Dynasty. After the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties, landscape paintings have been regarded as the orthodox genre. As for the production of sketch paintings, (Chinese books refer to sketch paintings, referring to flowers and birds, etc., which is also different from the sketch paintings in Western paintings), it was still after the Song and Yuan Dynasties, just like the situation of Western paintings, where there were only figure paintings before the 19th century, and landscape paintings only appeared after the 19th century.</p>

<h3>Scientific Invention Warfare</h3>
<p>— Pan Li</p>
<p>The war between Britain and Germany today is not only a military positional war or a naval and air war, but also a political war, an economic war, a production war, a blockade war, or a war of nerves. We can understand that this is also a war between British and German scientists and inventors by looking at the following facts that have occurred since the outbreak of the European war.</p>
<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Germans laid magnetic mines on the sea. This new weapon was unprecedented, and many British ships were wrecked. As a result, British scientists were mobilized to study ways to deal with magnetic mines. As a result, the method was researched within nine days, making it impossible for the Germans to use their skills.</p>
<p>In this war, the quality of the bombs dropped by German aircraft has exceeded the expectations of the general public. A small plane can not only carry a large number of bombs, but also has extremely powerful destructive power. In this regard, the British can be said to be self-deprecating. However, British scientists are not willing to give up. They are still working diligently in the laboratory. It is said that they have invented a new type of bomb with fierce explosive power and convenient carrying, which can increase the destructive power of each bomber by 50%. According to the British, the method of making this bomb is strictly confidential, but the bomb itself will exert its power in the coming months.</p>
<p>If this news is true, it is expected that German scientists will certainly not be outdone, and there will be newly invented weapons to resist it. But the civilians in the rear are going to suffer.</p>
<p>Armaments</p>
<h3>Secret Weapons?</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiapei</p>
<p>During wartime, scientists in each warring country are doing their utmost to research new weapons, and even ordinary people are sending many fanciful new suggestions to various military agencies.</p>
<p>During the last European war, someone in Britain suggested using a quick-drying cement to spray into the enemy's trenches, instantly making the enemy soldiers "as stiff as a stone." Others advocated turning tanks into giant lawn mowers, fitted with sharp blades on all sides, so that when they rushed into enemy lines, the blades would dance, cutting and killing enemy soldiers like chopping melons and vegetables.</p>
<p>In this European war, Britain received almost three hundred suggestions every week, but less than one percent of them were useful. The following are some interesting suggestions and inventions from all parties during a week in March.</p>
<p>(1) British aviation expert Noel Bering criticized the irrationality of turning off the lights during night raids. He advocated that all kinds of powerful lights should be concentrated and shone into the sky, so that the entire attacked area would be like a "sea of light." In this way, the enemy's flares would be useless, and the night raiders would not be able to aim and drop bombs because of the dazzling lights.</p>
<p>(2) News from Zurich, Switzerland, said that the Germans have recently been spraying a chemical agent over general factories, forests, barracks and residences, giving them fire-resistant properties that can resist the incendiary bombs dropped by the British air force.</p>
<p>(3) There is also an invention that the Germans are now able to paint the exterior of submarines in the same color as seawater (originally submarines were gray). Although seawater can change color from time to time and place to place, submarines can use spray guns to finish spraying the paint that matches the color of seawater in an instant when they rise to the surface.</p>
<p>As for the various new suggestions from the British, most of them are for coping with aggression.</p>
<p>(1) Setting up huge magnets in various military fortresses to disrupt the compasses on invading ships, causing them to lose their direction and go astray.</p>
<p>(2) Installing extremely long electric wires on the propellers (commonly known as propellers) of British air force aircraft, so that there is a half-mile-wide "dead net" when flying. This is especially effective in air combat.</p>
<p>(3) Installing high-voltage power grids on thoroughfares to electrocute enemy tank soldiers.</p>
<p>(4) As for the future British attack on the European continent, they can use an amphibious tank, crawl down the sea at the beach of Dover, and sneak all the way through the English Channel, and then suddenly climb ashore when they reach the coast of France, giving the enemy a surprising blow.</p>
<h3>Hoarding Everything</h3>
<p>"Why; buy so many coffins, are you doing charity work?"</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>When Zhao Yukun followed the nurse surnamed Li into ward number seven, Qiu Haitang's only remaining eye fixed on him without moving. Yukun's gaze naturally focused on Haitang's face, which was covered in gauze. The two remained silent for a full five minutes.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang's disheveled appearance was within Yukun's expectations, but Yukun's sudden transformation, becoming so haggard and thin, was something his junior brother could not have foreseen.</p>
<p>"Second Brother, how is Meishi?" Qiu Haitang couldn't help but raise his head and ask.</p>
<p>"Very well."</p>
<p>Another minute or two of silence passed.</p>
<p>"Third Brother, congratulations! Haven't you always been reluctant to sing falsetto? From now on, you won't be able to sing even if you want to. It's as if heaven has answered your prayers!" Others grew up eating food, but Zhao Yukun seemed to have grown up joking. Reuniting with his sworn brother in such circumstances, he only said one serious thing before reverting to his usual jesting manner.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang quickly glanced at him with his right eye, unwilling to let the hospital staff know his true identity. "Is this a hospital or a prison, Third Brother?" Yukun sat on a small chair to the left of the bed, glancing sideways at the female nurse as he asked.</p>
<p>Before Qiu Haitang could understand his meaning and respond, Yukun added one final sentence:</p>
<p>"Why can't you let me talk to him alone?" Qiu Haitang knew he was being difficult again and almost laughed beneath the bandages.</p>
<p>"Because Mr. Zhou's condition is very poor, we need to stay here to take care of him." The female nurse was quite clever. Knowing that Yukun's words were directed at her, she headed towards the door, smiling as she said, "In that case, I can go out and rest for a while. If Mr. Zhou needs anything, please ring the bell!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you!" Qiu Haitang said to her, too late, his voice remaining very weak. (110)</p>
<h3>Hess's Airplane</h3>
<p>— Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>When the third leader of Germany, Hess, fled to England by plane, he was riding in a famous German Messerschmitt 110 fighter plane. The plane had many bullet holes, indicating that it had exchanged fire with British planes in the air before.</p>
<p>Recently, the British shot down a German Messerschmitt 110 aircraft, which crashed without any damage. The British Ministry of Aviation specially sent the plane to the United States for research purposes. It was shipped by the cargo ship Montanan, passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived safely in New York on April 5th.</p>
<p>American aircraft engineers, after conducting research, believed that the aircraft was well-made and could compete with the first-class aircraft of Britain and the United States. The aircraft's speed could reach over 365 miles per hour, with a range of 800 miles. It was equipped with four machine guns and two cannons in the front, and a rotating machine gun in the tail. The plane could accommodate three people: a pilot, a radio operator, and a gunner. It had two 1,150-horsepower engines and could be used for combat and protection, and could use low-quality fuel, which was very economical. Its only shortcoming was that the iron plates protecting the aircraft's seats were too thin.</p>

<h3>My Cousin's Letter</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary bombing, our hospital has moved to a location near Chongqing.</p>
<p>Although the facilities are simple, the patients feel very satisfied thanks to the efforts of every doctor and nurse. Most of those admitted here are from the common people. Because of their good health, childbirth is very smooth. In the past two months, we have not encountered a single difficult delivery.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, surgeries and pelvic dissections are too common. Chongqing, due to the concentration of urban people, also frequently performs surgeries. But here, we may forget our delivery skills. The Creator truly does not treat everyone unfairly!</p>
<p>In addition to hospital affairs, we often go out to do some research work.</p>
<p>The people of Sichuan have indeed understood what is meant by national crisis and what is meant by responsibility! Although they are all living below the general standard of living, there is no complaining or sighing. Everyone is standing in their place. What they expect is light: their belief is victory!</p>
<p>Although prices are high, the general public has universally become accustomed to thrift. With patched clothes, they can still attend meetings. Visiting guests, they do not feel poor. My coat is so tattered that I would have replaced it with a new one in Shanghai, but the "at least one thousand yuan" price has inspired me to abandon my aesthetic views. A tattered coat can still keep me warm. Who dares to look down on me?</p>
<p>I can't even remember the scent of Bai Yu Shuang and Sanhua powder. My colleagues all use local honey, never apply powder, and their shiny faces are a hundred times more energetic!</p>
<p>We are now planning our summer attire:</p>
<p>Everyone will wear short shirts and shorts, bare legs, and shoes woven from waste cloth in an openwork style. I think there is not enough beauty, but there is plenty of 'modernity'!</p>
<p>Truly, there is freedom and soul here! We can run, we can sing! I forgot that I am a medical doctor, I am the director of obstetrics, I only feel that I am a child, an angel spreading joy!</p>

<h3>Chaplin on Wartime Cinema and Its Future</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>Wartime Only Needs Entertaining Comedies - War Films Should Be Made After Peace</p>
<p>In Chaplin's reception room, beautiful sunlight streamed in from the window, reflecting a bright golden color on the walls. Sitting at the table was a small man with gray hair and a short mustache on his lip. At first glance, one might almost mistake him for "The Great Dictator" Hitler. Looking again, it turned out that Hitler's mustache was the same as his. Chaplin was draped in a black coat, his eyes shining brightly. After a long silence, he began to speak to the reporters.</p>
<p>"Every war in Europe will have some impact on the world. This European war, being so fierce, will naturally have a significant impact on Hollywood. It makes us more aware of the public's problems and gives us an international perspective. It also makes the people of Hollywood realize that Hollywood is, after all, a part of America and not some secluded paradise that can be unaffected by war. Although we are not directly involved in the whirlpool of war, we are greatly affected economically and emotionally. The commercial situation of our country will change as a result, and Hollywood cannot be an exception."</p>
<p>"The direct impact of the war," he continued, "is to introduce more humorous material on the screen, not only for the troubles of the people and soldiers at home but also abroad. Only when we reach a time of peace can we offer more tears. So once the peace treaty is signed, we will have many great war films. If it doesn't end, then entertaining comedies will continue. Because the audience's psychology when watching films is for entertainment, not for news. Reporting news is the job of newspapers and radio, while the art of film is based on action and emotion."</p>
<p>"In addition, I can predict that in 1942, many small companies will be established in Hollywood. Based on a spirit of cooperation, they will produce excellent films that can meet the needs of the times, fully conform to social psychology, and make the film industry more important and universal than it is today. What these creators try will be beyond the dreams of those large companies now. The same is true for stars. At that time, we certainly need outstanding figures, such as Bette Davis, Garbo, Spencer Tracy, and others' art, but we also need stars with modern awareness. As long as they can fit the times, they can become good actors."</p>
<p>"At the same time, movie fans will become more demanding. War will become the central topic of conversation. Economic waves in society may not seem to greatly affect personal life on the surface, but later, these economic fluctuations will affect all countries in the world. No one knows what will happen in the future. We stand in a transitional era. The future depends entirely on what we do now, but as a rule, after a major war, there will be a huge change in each society, so in a few years, life in Hollywood will also change greatly."</p>
<p>"As for me," Chaplin said with a playful smile, "my future plans are not yet certain. It is difficult to fix a path in business. In short, I love Hollywood, I love movies, and I love my friends, but I don't really like its atmosphere. In the eyes of Los Angeles businessmen, I may be a weirdo! But what I seek is permanent light."</p>
<h3>New Camille</h3>
<p>— Liu Liu</p>
<p>Li Lihua is a multifaceted actress? She can play many different roles, many different emotional dramas. In "New Camille," she plays both a country girl and an urban girl. Because of the different identities, there are many different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, worry, and melancholy. In the film industry of 1941, Li Lihua will be one of the most successful actors.</p>
<p>The cast of "New Camille" includes Li Lihua, Zheng Zhong, Zhang Cuiying, Guan Hongda, Fan Xuepeng, Yan Hua, etc. (The picture above shows the expressions of Li and Zheng.)</p>
<h3>Symphony of Film and Drama</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Han Langen and Yin Xiucen were originally just a pair of clowns who simply created some humorous laughs on the screen. Recently, however, because they starred in Wu Yonggang's "Souls of the Sea of People," the story of which is also mainly based on humor, the entire theme strongly gives a humorous satire and criticism of the deformed system of society. They were greatly moved, and the two jointly thought about a comedy story with the same meaning. The play is tentatively titled "Shanghai Gold Rush." Yin Xiucen personally wrote the outline, and the full dialogue and stage directions were entrusted to Pei Chong.</p>
<p>The Tianfeng Drama Troupe's "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," directed by Wu Fuzhi, will be performed in various local dialects. The principle is that the population is concentrated in Shanghai from all over the country. If "Mandarin is unified," it is inevitable that some people will not understand, and it is questionable whether everyone in a house can speak Mandarin? By analogy, Tianfeng's past performances of "Crossroads" and the Shanghai Art Theater's current performance of "City of Sorrow" seem to all need to abandon Mandarin due to their depiction of Shanghai and perform them in various local dialects. In this way, the civilization of spoken drama can be promoted and expanded!</p>
<p>The United Company, supported by Zhu Shilin, is inclined to costume films, so after "Princess Bi Luo," it plans to shoot another costume film of the same nature. The script is being written by Zhu Shilin. However, Wang Xichun believes that costume films are already outdated and has expressed his opinion, disagreeing with putting on the costume again and making this kind of so-called costume film that is both outdated and has no historical significance.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth</p>
<p>Liu Yin, Ying sighed and said: "This is a long story, but fortunately, Mr. Xu wants to stay here for a few days. Let me slowly tell you about it." Xu Jing didn't dare to force him. He also said: Liu Yin, Ying's marksmanship is excellent, expressing his admiration. Liu Yin, Ying said: "How can the two of us be worth mentioning? Now, General Zhou Yuji, the general soldier of Ningwu, is stationed here, he can be called a hero of this era. There are many talented people under his command. Since he came, bandits in the area have disappeared, the village lanes are peaceful, and who dares to harass even a blade of grass or a tree from afar? The people sing his praises, and their praise spreads far and wide. Such a general is worthy of admiration. I heard that the roving bandits in Shaanxi are very rampant and may invade. I think there will inevitably be some fighting in the Daizhou area. Mr. Xu, with his extraordinary talent, why not join General Zhou's command, work hard for the country, and establish fame? He is currently recruiting talents, so he probably won't refuse. Xu Jing listened to Liu Yin, Ying's words, and he thought to himself that I had just come out from under General Zhou's command, how could he know the pain I had in leaving? So he smiled and said: "Brother Liu is right. I want to take the opportunity to achieve meritorious service, but I'll wait a few days and then go with Brother Liu to visit General Zhou, how about it? Even someone as incompetent as I am is unwilling to be buried, let alone Brother Liu, who is young and handsome, and skilled in martial arts, why hide away, like pearls buried in the great marsh, and paulownia trees hidden in the deep mountains?" Liu Yin, Ying smiled and said: "Thank you very much for Mr. Xu's encouragement. However, I am a very casual person and do not want to be restrained by others, so I have never joined the army. However, I have never lagged behind others in my love for the country, and of course I am willing to work for the country if there is an opportunity." The two were talking enthusiastically when Liu Yin, Ying's aunt, Old Madam Zheng, walked to the door of the study and said: "The guest has come from afar, and I suppose he hasn't had lunch yet. I've specially cooked some noodles that look like dumplings. Please, Mr. Xu, have some as you like." Xu Jing listened and quickly stood up and said: "Oh, you're too kind, old madam." Liu Yin, Ying said: "It should be so, please don't be polite." So he accompanied Xu Jing to the outer parlor, because Liu Yin, Ying had already eaten, so he let Xu Jing eat alone. After Xu Jing finished eating, he thanked the two. Liu Yin, Ying also accompanied Xu Jing to stroll on the ridge and admire the scenery. Xu Jing felt that Liu Yin, Ying's speech was both cheerful and somewhat charming, making people feel as if they were drinking intoxicating wine, and thought that he was truly a descendant of Wang and Xie, free and refined, and difficult to find in this chaotic world. Therefore, he already had several points of admiration in his heart, and also gathered his spirits, and expressed the ambitions in his chest. (67)</p>
<h3>Abstract of Philosophy of Practice</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>The passage of action leads to harmonious results. Great passage leads to great harmony, and small passage leads to small harmony, because the purpose of action is to seek to survive. Seeking to survive for the people of a country, action naturally passes through the country, and the people of the country will be able to live in harmony.</p>
