<h3 id="c28">軸心威脅下之南美危機 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>美總統羅斯福氏在本月二十七日所發表的海軍節演辭中，曾特別揭發軸心集團之陰謀，和南美洲所遭遇的危機。據羅氏宣布，他已獲有德國所繪製的秘密地圖，圖中擅分南美洲為五附庸國，而整個置之於希特勒之統治下，其中並包括巴拿馬共和國及為美國生命綫之巴拿馬運河在內。此項演辭宣布後，頓在南美各處，引起重大的注意和反應。前阿根廷外長佩雷當氏，甚且認為希特勒在南美的企圖之失敗、將以美總統此日之宣言為其開始。世人於此，當不難看出美德雙方激盪衝突之廣汎而猛烈。</p>
<p>現時柏林方面對此秘密地圖，雖斥為偽造，而美總統也因維護情報路綫關係，未肯遽爾將此圖完全公布，但就客觀判斷，軸心集團，一定有此野心。猶憶當希特勒執政之初，納粹即在柏林威廉街第七號設「國社黨外務部」。由羅森堡主持其事·負擴大「第三德意志帝國」領土之責任，這就是有名的「褐色國際」。羅森堡並曾訂立一對外政策行動力略，這方略，常被稱為羅森堡計劃，其要點是：（一）組織反布爾希維克國際聯合陣綫，陷蘇聯於孤立；（二）聯義大利以制英法，並盡量離間歐洲各國間之關係，俾收各個擊破之效；（三）聯合東方的日本，以包圍蘇聯，並牽制美國；（四）積極東進，求發展德國領土於東南歐及東北歐；（五）加緊擴充軍備，做外交的後盾。其時有法人恩斯脫亨利（Erust　Heuri）者，曾著有「希特勒征服歐洲　計劃」及「希特勒征服俄國的計劃」兩書，揭發羅森堡計劃之內容，以警醒歐洲諸國。可惜當時大家多等閑視之，結果若干年來，德國政府不但能穀一步一步依照羅森堡計劃實行，而且能彀乘虛蹈隙，一步一步收順利之效果。以彼例此，現時羅斯福總統所得而見之秘密圖籍，殆正羅森堡計劃之繼續或延長而已。何況德國當前的主妥敵人，雖為東方的蘇聯及西方的英國，但在這兩國後面，都有强大的美國為之作有力之援助，所以德國對美的憤恚，或許竟超出對英蘇者而上之，則其必欲得美國而甘心，正是意料中事。</p>
<p>美國在大西洋上的防務，原來也有一條ABC防線，就是：對南須能守衛阿根廷（A）及巴西（B）之海岸，對北須能確保加拿大（C）之安全。自從英美軍事聯盟實際成立以來，加拿大和美國的防務，早已打成一片，乃至格林蘭和冰島，也都已由美軍駐防，所以北大西洋的形勢，業經相當鞏固，所可憂念的，無髯在南美洲方面。南美小國林立，意見常不一致，防禦力量，當然薄弱，而且最是外來第五縱隊陰謀活動之理想塲所。這一點，對美國素來構成一種不利，美國也早經發見到此，而力求加以補救，遠在一八二三年時，即發表門羅宣言，以保障整個美洲之不受外來勢力干涉，自從一九三三年羅斯福總統當選就任以來，更推行善隣及互惠通商之政策，並積極參加屢决之汎美洲會議，以增强全美洲之團結與合作。可是南美洲各國的複雜環境，一時畢竟不易得澈底之改造，至今仍為國際間陰謀活動之對象。允其自從本年六月間美國封閉全部德義領館後，軸心國在新大陸之間諜活動，更移其重心於南美。如上月中旬，阿根廷議會竟不得不開外交史上之新例，通過議案，不同意德國大使查曼博士繼續留居阿境，作非法之活動。又巴拿馬是美國生命綫巴拿馬運河的通過地，而其總統阿利亞斯，竟為軸心國所操縱，直到本月九日，纔因革命而被推翻。這一切，都足以補充美總統之演辭，而顯示軸心國家近來對南美侵蝕之急進。將來萬一法屬西非洲的達加港終不勝壓迫而落入納粹手中，則其距巴西之東端不過一八六二英里南美洲以及美國所遭受的威脅，亦將更重大且更直接。</p>
<p>經羅斯福總統揭奸發覆大聲疾呼後，相信南美各國，一定不致再蹈歐陸諸邦之覆轍，而能與美國和衷共濟，共謀抵抗侵略的主動而有效之步驟。而且軸心國集團對美洲的包圍進襲，不僅來自大西洋，也來自太平洋，關於此點，日前美海長諾克斯氏發表演說，聲明「日本如不放棄其擴展計劃，則遠東衝突勢不可免」時，已作坦白之宣布，支持諾氏言論的一切必要行動，當然都在積極踐履中了。</p>
<p>歐戰叢談</p>
<h3 id="c29">法國人的苦悶 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>第三共和國是戰敗了，據歷史看，一種政體經過這種慘變之後，是難得會依然存在的然而一百五十年以上的法國歷史，難道就應被吾認嗎？法國大革命，和上世紀中傾向自由，光明和公道，而使法國成為偉大的全部努力，難道就可一筆抹煞嗎？法國為此奮鬥和撑持了幾及二百年之久的精神和原理，一旦若被排斥，便不啻承認祇知武力和機會主義的納粹是不錯的了。</p>
<p>一九四〇年九月十五日出版的「兩月評論」中載有一篇文字，係由貝當署名發表，這位法國元首會自述所懷說：</p>
<p>「自由主義，資本主義，和集體主義，都是輸入法國的舶來品，法國自應加以拒絕。她已明白過去把不適合於木國土地氣候的制度和方法，移植過來，是誤入歧途。及至把敵人勝利的原則加以檢視，方才吃驚地認淸幾乎隨處皆有她自己的資產，最純潔和最可靠的傳統。……國社主義有工作第一的理想，和有關貨幣制度的現實，使我們立即認出那是我們祖傳遺產的一部份。我可以歷舉證明，自各方面引導我們到我們所自有而不幸忘却的眞理，使我們不必假借於人而重行收回，且可一望而知那班懂得如何比我們更善於利用此種眞理的人。由此可以看到，我們不必自暴自棄，祇須恢復本來面目，即能使我們與行將領導重建世界的人們，思想行動趨於一致。」</p>
<p>無數法國人，一想到祖國的情形，即爲之惴惴不安，其主要原因，皆在於此。他們很願相信貝當和與他合作的人，確是忠心愛國，不顧一切，以盡力拯救國家，可是這班人的哲學，願意和納粹妥協，不但在事實上合作，且在道德上政洽上合作，使一向主張法國的名字不能與自主，容忍和個人們由分離的人們，動搖了信仰，像這種「眞理」，確為法國所有，並非希特勒　　借而較我自更善於利用者。這是他要摧毀，而使之不再存在於世界上的眞理。</p>
<p>法國政府雖欲保全法國的生命，同時却排斥使法國生存的若干主要觀念，以致引起許多矛盾，有一般在美國等處對法國命運具有深切價仰者，因之無從索解，而許多忠實的法國人，亦為之困惑不安。</p>
<p>我們不能一方面說已為德國所完全戰敗，一方面依然獨立。一個人怎能半為奴隸半屬自由呢？</p>
<p>只要一看波捷荷挪丹比羅意等國的前例，就知我們願意與納粹合作以建立新秩序的一說，也是不能成立的。若說希特勒的待遇法國，將與他國不同，不論他的諾言如何，殆與同謀無異。我們戰敗投降以後，英國便祇能為自已的生存而獨立作戰，也就無怪乎他們背棄我國。在慕尼黑會議之時，若干法國人還說捷克是咎由自取，却不知常時法國與捷克會訂有條的，而竟為法國領袖所毀。</p>
<p>我們若向美國人呼籲要求他們顧全美法傳統的友誼，而强迫英國鬆弛對法的對鎖，以稍紓法人的窮困，而於同時沒有一言提及德國佔領軍的搶刦擄掠，這呼籲又怎能成立呢？法國所付的賠款，合每年三十萬萬元，而德國在道威斯計劃乏下，從未付過賠款至六萬萬以上。假使維希政府要引起全世界注意於法國的慘運，—我恐維希政府是應該這樣做的—牠應該從德國的書本中獲得一頁教訓，也應該記得德國於一九一四年後如何的　用凡爾賽和約。法國正受着異常的痛苦，而將來的痛苦，或者還要增加。除了希特勒治下的德國人外，尙有何人應為之負責呢？</p>
<p>稱讃貝當元帥較賴伐爾更能尊重法國輿論，這也是不相應的事，他是在反覆申言信仰希特勒「合作」的政策哩。</p>
<p>最後，法國人一方面要重修美法陸誼的傳統政策，同時又含糊接受納粹的歐洲新秩序，在這美國已正式向世界宣稱她決不接受這種新秩序的建立的時候，也是矛盾不能一致的</p>
<p>一自法國在去年六月二十二日簽訂休戰條約以來，每念祖國，我不禁感到法國正向精神道德日趨孤立的末路前進。範罩在被德征服各國上面的黑暗，現在已到達了大西洋彼岸。眞的，有許多法國人從德國來，也有許多逃過檢查的信不時寄來，只是我即使會見了素所深信的人，或是接到密友的來鴻。我對法國已更難接近的感覺，仍不為之稍减。法國戰敗所引起的許多悲劇，，使根本上和特質上屬於法國的若干價值失去統一，這就是其中之一哩。</p>
<p>我在前面已經說過我活了這許多年，直到最近的六月為止，一生中從未對我是法國公民，可以隨個人所欲自由思想的這個事實發生過衝突。這並不使我因感到愛國而自傲，也不能給我任何私人的快意，我不過承認這點，好像今日的美國人承認牠一樣，</p>
<p>可是現在不獨對於我，也對於所有的法人，無論他身居法國或作客他鄕，都有些為難了。批評和異議在法國從未消减，但是准許批評和異議的基本原則，却有些岌岌可危了。法國的家族，遭到從未有過的分崩離折，凡不肯　從貝當政策的人們，都被貝當之徒目為賣國賊。自由已在法國消减，恐怖代之而興，他們恐懼個人和家族的安全，恐懼被人駡為不愛國，又因是非的標準已經動搖而深恐做錯了事。</p>
<p>做法國人含有什麼意義呢</p>
<p>這個問題，到今天纔能提出，但沒有一個答覆。</p>
<p>無疑的此答案正在醞釀之中。就我個人的信仰言，我不相信目前法國領袖的政策，和他們對於若干基本觀念的懷疑態度，有何益處。但就另一方面說，因為所涉的問題，遠非動盪不穏且受征服者限制的維希政府的先見所能解決，所以他們或者也不會有何大害。</p>
<p>這種問題，牽涉到西方文化本身的存在，形式或許變更，但其基本觀念，決不容有何更改。這種基本觀念，歷史已和古希臘一樣的悠久。其一即為自由和尊重個人。我們在法國誤用了這種觀念，，這是事實，但決不能證明這種歡念是錯誤的。</p>
<p>納粹或能暫時將法國打倒，暫時將法國人對於法國在世界上所代表的是什麼這一個歡念　意曲解。但他們縱然能把法國完全毀減，我仍毫不遲疑的相信，法國必能復興而重睹光明。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c85">日光節約 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>上海兩租界常局自十一月一日中夜起又要把鐘點一律撥轉一小時了。市民們在此時此地對於節的，已盡過最大的努力，此次從事於日光節的運動，表現頗為良好，現在為了季候關係，當局就可告一段落。</p>
<p>日光節的對於我們十二分的適合，它已經盡過矯正都市生活不合理的責任。一班卜畫而夜的人們至少會受到部份的影響。誰不愛目然的光明？誰小愛靑天，白日？我們為了必要，不妨多多享　日光的撫愛，洗刷，尤其是病人，更非要被照耀不可，日光對於他們的健康原來是非常適宜的。</p>
<p>當此之時，我們還可　我檢討一番：是否已革除了頽唐，遲誤，羞明，怕迎　日光的壞習慣？我們確已振奮了自已的身心，提倡早起早作了嗎？我們的精神業經動員過嗎？已過着改造了的生活嗎？</p>
<p>假使回答是個「不」，那你就虛度了日光節約。日光節的不論在何種塲合都有其必要，這非由鐘點撥快撥慢，所可限制，要是斤斤於此點，則其效力有限，而且在我們中國的中央標準時的「正朔」關係上，不無有其誤會。我們要日光節的，精神節的，物質節的，並節的一切，為了我們的前途。</p>
<p>初聽鷄鳴，中心深覺感奮，此非惡聲也！大家努力，仍然從事於時問之節約。我們最後，必有光明，然則須自養成喜見光明的習慣始！</p>
<p>我們於此對於當局疇昔推行日光節的，表示感意。</p>

<p>友人某君，才思過人，而其攻讀大學已逾六載，仍無畢業消息，緣其君一向鍾情於低年級之Y女士，追求多年，迄無結果，君猶不氣餒，甘願留校，借讀書為名，俾得朝夕相見，或有天從人願之一日也，不意女士心緊似鐵，背地謂人曰：「即使世界死剩某君一人，仍無答允之理。」此語旣出，某君如逢大赦，學期甫終，登時取得文憑。</p>

<p>— 方揚</p>
<p>—是誰人之過？</p>
<p>「唉，眞是糖炒栗子，難過日子！一媽感慨地嘆着氣，順手把小菜籃一丟，一面拿出籃裏的幾樣菜：</p>
<p>「草頭賣五六角一斤，洋山芋一斤要九角，一元，精肉六元一斤，兩角錢荳腐裝勿滿一小飯碗……我眞勿會買哉！」顯然地，媽是慣慨得很的。</p>
<p>「阿揚，儂想，今朝只賣仔半斤草頭，一斤洋山芋，一塊洋鈿肉，薄得風都吹得去的，再加幾張百頁，一碗荳腐，兩塊半洋鈿就不看見哉！唉……」一邊說，媽隨手就拿了菜籃到廚房裏去了。</p>
<p>停停，媽走了出來，臉上又是一臉的愁容，「煤球又要用光快哉，外頭講，今朝要十九塊担了。叫儂早點喊，早點喊，勿聽，奈儂去叫去！」</p>
<p>顯然　，媽是生氣了，但帶着着同情和感慨的口吻。其實，我這每月收入一百五十元左右的入，而在這每天一開門卻非八塊錢不辦的年頭，眞叫有點「那個！」</p>
<p>但報紙是不能不看的，媽雖在嘮叨，我却只能裝做不聽見似的捧了報紙。好像，這樣可以把這煩悶解除點，可是翻開來的不是：「現金漲無止境：一度出二萬元關，」就是「現紗漲停板十三次。」</p>
<p>再看過去：「米囤鬼活躍，一號西貢跳一百八十二元。」「肥皂火柴飛騰。」「糖市又趨高昂。」</p>
<p>總之，日常必需品，就無一不在飛漲之列。</p>
<p>翻翻報紙就越翻越火，索性把報也丟了，省得更添上麻煩。於是，早飯也懶得吃！回了聲媽，就出去辦公去了——把這不能解決的問題，再躭擱一下，而讓內心的咀嚼，更多受些時候。因為投機，囤積的傢伙，它是不會為了某些人的餓死，凍死，而動一動心的，那末，你即便死了，也是徒然</p>
<p>晚上，回家，人已經鑽進了被窩，媽又來了：「我的襯杉袍子破了，現在一個布面子也至少要念幾塊錢，夾衫，襯絨就算它有舊的，做工也要十塊錢，那末，非有四十塊錢不能成功！」說着，聲音有點嘶啞，顯然的，在流着眼淚，可是，在黑暗裏，我看不見。</p>
<p>第二天起來，我不聲不響的，硬着頭皮把件夾大衣送進了當舖，換來了一百二十只洋，拿着它給了媽，來解決這些別人所壓上來的問題。</p>
<p>報紙上各樣東西還是每天在看漲，眞快把我們的喉管都要漲斷了。我担心，我們這些人（是社會上佔最着一個大多數的階層）能活到幾時！</p>

<p>「即使能的話，不瞞你錢先生說，他是我心裏疼愛的人，也決不願意讓她隨隨便便的出台。」</p>
<p>「這樣說，她戲是一定會唱的了！」錢若默把右手上一條給雪茄烟薰得像蠟一樣黃的鷄指豎起來，胡亂向西邊一指。「可是這紅舞台也不是一個小地方，要是第一次就在這兒漏臉，將來倒是很有希望的」</p>
<p>「錢先生，你的好意我眞不知道怎樣感謝才好。」秋海棠旋過頭去，看着那個抽雪茄烟像打排槍一樣從不間斷的大作家說：「不過這個孩子實在是我的性命，要是她能出台的話，我就不願意讓她掛二牌！此刻別說她的能耐不够，我的面子太小，就是這兩件事不成問題，我也沒有這麼許多的錢給她裝行頭；要是行頭沒有，頭牌還是掛不成。我自己少說也唱過十多年的戲，裏頭的情形大略還知道一些，憑我那孩子目前的幾分玩藝兒，以及我自已的一些老面子，大不了在這兒掛個九牌十牌，已經是借你先生的光了！但像這樣不上不下的角兒，私房行頭也不能沒有，兩個或三個伙計又是不能少的；這些本錢就不是我這個窮光蛋可以想法的了，何况化了這些本錢也米必紅得起來？所以，錢先生，暫時我絕對不打算教她出台。」（二五〇）</p>

<h3 id="c91">英茵的過去和現在 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>英茵在舞台上的演技的洗煉，很早就給予愛好話劇者一個不能磨滅的深刻的印象，她的嗓子淸朗，台步穩重，演技表情，又入於爐火純靑。她是今日藝擅，不可多得的優秀人才。</p>
<p>戰前，她演過「慾魔」，「武則天，「太平天國」等。在這幾憫戲中「武則天」演來最是成功，她抓住了這潑辣兇暴的女皇帝的特殊的個性，正如江泓在「淸宮怨」中抓住了「西太后」的陰險又精明強幹的面貌一樣。</p>
<p>戰後，她抱着極大的雄心與志願，到重慶去發展，後來又轉道至成都，長沙，香港一帶，演過的戲，有「阿Q正傳，，「殘霧」，「民族光榮」，「中國萬歲」等。</p>
<p>「殘霧」是老舍的得意傑作，上演之日，老舍亦為座上客，他看得很得意的樣子，散塲後，就跑到後台去訪問英茵，除了讚美她演戲的天才以外，又送了不少鼓勵她的金玉良言，對於這些，英茵是永遠地記在心裏的。</p>
<p>「民族光榮」與「中國萬歲」，是二個正義感的戲，英茵在演過以後所得的感想是：</p>
<p>「劇本實在寫得太好了，我的熱情，就自然地跟着牠奔放，我知道觀衆的熱情，也一定受着重大的激刺而飛騰，因為每一句話，每一句台詞，都是活的，牠就活在我們的心裏」。</p>
<p>去年重來上海，應民華，大風二影業公司之請，鄭重拍攝費穆的原著「世界兒女」，這戲從世界在潮寫到人海微瀾，由兒女私情幻出時代風雲，劇中她担任「時代的女兒」一角，很合個性，導演賈克佛萊克會稱讀着說：</p>
<p>「英茵如再能用功學習，前途正無可限量」。</p>
<p>她拍過的影片，尚有「返魂香」，「賽金花」，等五六部作品。</p>
<p>最近上海劇藝社決定排演曹禺繼「蛻變」後的最新作品「北京人」，劇中有一位兇狠陰險的少奶奶叫會思懿，友誼情商英茵客串，聞已首肯，而且她還發表意見說：</p>
<p>「我是很歡喜演話劇的，但這一次來上海以後，還沒有上過台，原因是為了身體時常不舒服，拍電影時間也有衝突，而又沒有適合個性的劇本」</p>
<p>英茵是北平人，父母已去世，現在她只一個人孤零零地在上海。她平時除了愛好話劇和文學以外，叉喜歡養狗。</p>
<p>檢討她的過去和現在，沒有一個時閒，不是在虛心學習中追尋生活，這是很對的。藝人的態度，極應慈愛，藝人的舉止，尤宜嚴肅，驕怠成性，自暴自棄的風頭主義者，，是永遠不會有前途的，只是在在黑暗中摸索而已。</p>
<h3 id="c92">上海人觀「愁城記」　格外顯出市儈的醜態 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 琪華</p>
<p>不久以前，在書店裏買到了一本夏衍著的「愁城記」，讀了以後，覺得很感動。在這裹面所寫的，全是上海目前的許多事實。近來幾天，市面上動盪得很厲害，金子的漲風極盛，物價也跟着像飛也似的奔騰直上。上海人在生活的重担下，壓得差不多透不過氣來，在這樣困苦動亂的時期中，於是便產生了各種各樣的人物，他們有着各自不同的處世方法，因此他們所得到的也就是各不相同的命運。正如在「愁城記」中所描寫的一樣；像囤積投機的趙福泉，狡猾險惡的何晋芳，對生活有着淸楚認識的李彥云，和小圈子主義的趙婉夫婦……等等。</p>
<p>這些人物如果從舞臺上看到，一定要比從書本上看到的來得親切和熟悉的多。銀錢劇團要在下月二日，日夜兩塲在蘭心戲院公演這齣戲了，這至少對於我－這未會看過「愁城記」演出的人，是一個很值得高興的消息。</p>

<h3 id="e1">US Establishes 79 Strongholds: Building a Two-Ocean Naval and Air Front, Monitoring Japanese Military Installations on Mandated Islands; Australia and New Zealand Agree on Joint Measures <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington, March 10th, United Press – Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox stated yesterday that the Navy is "aware" of Japan's military preparations in the Pacific Islands. The Secretary made this statement in response to questions from the press and offered broad commentary on general affairs, from the attack on the US destroyer Kearny to the mass production program of American military supplies. Colonel Knox said that the Navy has been paying attention to Japan's military installations on the Pacific Islands under its "careful protection." No protests have been heard from Japan regarding the US's fortification efforts in the Pacific region. The reason everyone is actively questioning Colonel Knox is that the Navy is constructing a chain of naval and air stations and bases, like an iron net, at 79 locations in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific, and the work is progressing smoothly. The size of each base varies; some can accommodate one squadron of aircraft, while others can accommodate hundreds. In 1939, the US only had six main bases.</p>
<p>Canberra, March 30th, Reuters – New Zealand Finance Minister Nash attended today's War Cabinet meeting and made important decisions regarding joint actions between Australia and New Zealand. Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated that defense and supply arrangements had been agreed upon, and the negotiations were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>London, March 30th, Reuters – Australian Special Representative Sir Earle Page arrived in England yesterday from Lisbon and immediately came to London. He told reporters that his visit was to discuss with the British government Australia's strategic position regarding the war, especially in the Pacific and Far East. The Australian people are determined and unwavering in their pursuit of the war. He will speak on behalf of the Australian people and the entire parliament.</p>
<p>London, March 30th, Reuters – According to a statement issued by No. 10 Downing Street, Sir Earle Page, sent by the Australian government to discuss various issues of common interest, attended a War Cabinet meeting at the invitation of the Prime Minister this morning. During his stay in England, Page will continue to participate in events related to the Australian government that are currently under consideration.</p>
<p>Chongqing, March 30th, Havas – The grand meeting to celebrate the victory of democratic nations, jointly held by the New York International Anti-Aggression Movement and the Free World Association, is scheduled to take place in Chongqing on the 2nd of next month. It will be hosted by the Chinese branch of the Anti-Aggression Movement, and people from all walks of life are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Mass in Northern Vietnam: Rumors of an Imminent Attack on the Burma Road</p>
<p>London, March 30th, United Press – Yesterday, the general impression here was that if US-Japanese negotiations fail, Japan's next move will be an attack on the Burma Road. This move is as detrimental to US interests as a Japanese advance in the north. Observers pointed out that Japanese troops are rumored to have massed in northern Vietnam, 200 miles from the Burma Road. Once that road is cut off, it will be easier to take action elsewhere in the future. Some experts believe that although Soviet troops are rumored to have retreated westward, a large number of Soviet troops remain stationed in the Far East, especially the air force, preparing to respond to Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>New York, March 30th, United Press – Newsreel cameraman Monk, who has traveled 35,000 miles in the Far East, declared today, "There is no doubt that we must go to war with Japan sooner or later. I believe that time is almost here. We are being oppressed by the Axis on two fronts, and I don't think our Pacific tentacles are very strong."</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 30th, United Press – Chugai Commercial News said in today's editorial, "We do not believe that a conflict between Japan and the United States is unavoidable. If the United States sincerely wants to maintain peace in the Pacific, there is plenty of room for US-Japan negotiations to continue." It also criticized the US-Japan negotiations, calling them "premature war talks." The newspaper further stated, "Although some leaders in the United States are extremely optimistic, we firmly believe that it is not difficult to avoid conflict." The Commercial News believes that President Roosevelt's speech on "Navy Day," which did not mention the Far East issue, has "some implications," and stated, "Washington should acknowledge, with a generous attitude, that there is room for US-Japan negotiations to continue."</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 30th, United Press – Miyako Shimbun declared in today's editorial, "We warn the United States that if the United States stirs up trouble in the Pacific, it should bear full responsibility."</p>
<p>Tojo to Discuss US-Japan Negotiations in the Japanese Diet</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 30th, United Press – Asahi Shimbun reported today that the convening of the special Diet session on the 15th is to organize all of Japan on a completely wartime basis to cope with an unprecedented crisis. Prime Minister Tojo will begin the government's address, directly informing the public of the actual situation in Japan and, to the extent possible, explaining Japan's methods of coping with this situation. The future of the US-Japan negotiations should be clear by the time the Diet convenes on November 15th. Therefore, Tojo will explain the actual situation of the negotiations.</p>
<p>Chongqing, March 30th, Reuters – Sao Dang Pao stated in today's editorial that it was surprised by the rumor that Japan has suggested to the United States that a US-Japan agreement on the Far East be concluded before the opening of the Japanese Diet on November 15th. The article stated that although US Secretary of State Hull would not accept any Japanese proposal, it is not entirely outside the realm of possibility in view of the following: (1) Prime Minister Tojo has met with the Emperor of Japan many times since taking office; (2) US-Japan relations will be the main issue for discussion in the next Japanese Diet; (3) Japanese troops are currently conducting necessary military operations in Vietnam and Manchuria. What Sao Dang Pao is worried about is that the US authorities have neither confirmed nor denied this statement, and the European and Asian wars are now gradually merging into one. Therefore, November 15th may be the day that Japan turns into a full-scale belligerent country in the Pacific. Sao Dang Pao and other newspapers in Chongqing share the same opinion, advocating for the elimination of Japan first, as this is the best way for democratic countries to calmly resist Hitlerism.</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 30th, United Press – Kokumin Shimbun reported today that the "Japan East Asia League" and the "Diet Members' National Policy Implementation League" made "important suggestions" to the government yesterday, requesting that the government take appropriate steps to protect and assist Japanese residing in the southern region and protect their interests, as "these interests may be rejected due to the political pressure after the implementation of freezing regulations by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Tojo Delivers Speech: Acknowledges Serious Crisis; Aware of Countless Difficulties; Still States the Need to Move Forward Actively <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 30th, United Press – Prime Minister Tojo, the new president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, addressed 300 officials of the association today, saying, "Japan is currently facing an unprecedented crisis. We must unswervingly hold onto our strong belief in certain victory and advance forward to achieve the nation's mission." Tojo acknowledged that the work of the association has not been fully developed and explained his determination to promote the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement with strong political power so that national policies can be implemented and the expectations of the people are not disappointed. He stated that the government is prepared to work with the active assistance of the association to promptly implement essential national affairs in order to establish the high-speed national defense that is most needed at the moment. Tojo also said, "At a time when the world is in turmoil and humanity is engaged in the most barbaric struggle in history, it is a great honor for Japan to take on the great responsibility of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that each nation can find its place in the unity of all nations. However, the path to realizing this great ideal is not smooth. In fact, hostile countries are placing pressure and obstacles in our path. It is clear that we will encounter countless difficulties in the future. Therefore, we should first strengthen our solidarity and overcome all and any difficulties ahead with iron determination. At the same time, we should cooperate with all other nations in East Asia to prevent the current world tragedy from spreading. I intend to do my best to lead the country in this valuable work." He also said that the government will make special efforts to ensure that the government and the people can communicate freely and without obstruction, so that the people can fully understand the government's policies.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Dunn Arrives in Honolulu: Soon to Go to Chongqing; Claims Japan Is Surrounded; Will Never Defeat China <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Honolulu, March 30th, United Press – Mr. Dunn, the Australian advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, arrived here from Australia yesterday on the Mariposa, en route to Chongqing. Mr. Ding Poxai, a consultant to the government's propaganda department, arrived with him and is en route to Washington. Rumors were circulating that Dunn had permanently left the Far East, but it is said that his itinerary is well-prepared and he will return to Chongqing immediately and hopes to serve as an advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again. He also said, "Japan cannot win, nor will it ever defeat China. Japan has already been hit. What I cannot understand is why Britain and the United States are still hesitating to join in for the final blow." He added that the war in China has stalled, with Japan surrounded by enemies on all sides and unable to move in any direction. Japan's economy is also on the verge of collapse. Dunn pointed out that Japan has not had a single major victory since the first year of the war and has suffered multiple major defeats. He said, "I suspect that Japan's navy is superior to its army. The US Navy could strike a single blow and make Japan a third-rate country. What are they still waiting for? It is absolutely not because they are afraid of Japan." Mr. Ding Poxai stated that Japan would not risk fighting the Soviet Union and the British-American alliance in the Pacific at the same time, but if Japan does take action, it will probably be against the Red Army in Siberia shortly after Moscow falls. Japan also knows that it will encounter a strong enemy in Siberia, but it will probably take the risk. Japan will not advance south because the ABCD defense line is too strong. Preparations in southern Asia are virtually complete and can cope with any eventuality. He also revealed, "In recent months, many young American pilots and mechanics have arrived in Burma and southwest China. As far as we know, they were formerly pilots in the US Army and Navy and have now been granted permission to resign and serve in China. As far as I know, they have not yet actually participated in air combat in China. There are now more than 100 new American four-purpose aircraft driven by these American pilots."</p>

<p>Tokyo, March 30th, Reuters – Today, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry ordered the organization of control associations for the steel and coal industries, which is the first concrete step taken by the government to place key industries on a wartime footing. At the same time, the ministry order also designated 46 steel companies and 24 coal companies as eligible members of the proposed control association. The control associations for the coal and steel industries are scheduled to be established on November 1st and 4th, respectively. They will effectively have the power to control various activities of steel manufacturers in Japan and Manchuria, such as production allocation and consumption of import and export goods. It is expected that the ministry will issue similar orders to other key industries.</p>

<p>Changchun, March 30th – Yesterday, a Kwantung Army spokesperson said yesterday that the Soviet-Manchu border is peaceful and quiet. Although minor incidents occur from time to time, the situation cannot be considered serious. For weeks, the Soviet army has been withdrawing troops stationed in Siberia to Europe to fight the German army, so border incidents give the Soviet Union a headache. A large number of Soviet personnel are now infiltrating Manchuria, attempting to create incidents.

<h3 id="e9">Chinese Representative Addresses the International Labor Organization Conference: Hopes Participating Countries Will Strive for Victory and Rebuild a New World <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Washington, March 30th, Reuters – The International Labor Organization Conference convened yesterday. Zhu Xuefan, the Chinese labor representative, stated in his address that China has been at war for 51 months and hopes that participating countries will redouble their efforts to fight the war. When we achieve victory through the combined resources and markets of the world, then workers will be able to rebuild a new world. Zhu also stated the need for economic stability and social security for people of all countries, regardless of borders, and said that economic security would be meaningless without political independence. Indian representative Chetty and South African representative Te Water followed by stating that the governments of India and South Africa have begun to consider the issue of post-war job placement. Chetty said that this conference is an act of faith by the majority of the world's people in the rule of law and the final victory of humanity and justice, saying that India supports the International Labor Organization and welcomes Phelan's report on the possibility of developing machinery to meet the needs and conditions of Asia. He suggested that this move should be organized along the lines of the Eastern Group Supply Conference held in Delhi in 1940, with several Asian countries participating in the Eastern Group Conference, as well as Australia and South Africa, taking on the task of pooling their resources for war purposes. The International Labor Organization should study maintaining this local area and strive to pursue post-war recovery. He asked the conference to consider international action to raise the living standards of Eastern workers. He also stated the importance of agricultural workers, which has been neglected. South African representative Te Water stated that South Africa has realized that the well-being of its workers is not only maintained but also improved.</p>
<h3 id="e10">US Will Not Announce the Sinking of German Submarines <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Washington, March 30th, United Press – Secretary of the Navy Knox announced that the Kearny dropped depth charges to protect a merchant ship before being attacked by a submarine. He also said that the Navy may follow the British policy of not announcing the sinking of German submarines. The Secretary also said that there are indications that German submarines may have established bases near Canada or Dakar, but this does not necessarily mean that German submarines depart from Dakar. He also said that he has not seen President Roosevelt's map regarding Germany's plan to divide South America into five vassal states. Regarding submarine warfare, he said, "Britain has been at war for a long time, but you have not read about the sinking of many submarines. It is evident that many submarines have been sunk." Knox also said that if the US fleet engages in any action with the German surface raiding fleet, it will be announced. He also said, "The mass production plan for automobiles is now being used in the military equipment production program. We will show the world unprecedented military equipment production."</p>
<p>Washington, March 30th, Reuters – Regarding the torpedoing of the US destroyer Kearny, there is a new report stating that the ship was torpedoed while assisting a merchant ship to defend against a submarine attack. After the ship fired depth charges, three torpedoes came one after another. Two missed their target, and the third hit the middle of the ship, destroying the boiler room, killing eleven and wounding ten.</p>

<p>Washington, March 30th, United Press – Wisconsin Progressive Senator La Follette vehemently opposed the armed merchant ships bill in the Senate yesterday. Senator La Follette's father also attacked former President Wilson's ship arming bill in the Senate before the US entered World War I. Unexpectedly, La Follette is now engaged in the same action as his father in the same legislative body. This bill, which would amend the Neutrality Act and allow armed merchant ships to enter belligerent ports or war zones, has sparked fierce debate in the Senate. North Dakota Republican Senator Nye said that the first armed merchant ship to transport military equipment to England will be the vanguard to protect ships full of troops serving overseas. There is a very insightful saying in the West: if we pass this bill, then nine out of ten times we can be sure that the United States will go to war before England. The gloves have been taken off, and the claws have been extended. What is the purpose of this bill? Anyone who can read and think knows it very well. La Follette believes that those who agree with the government's foreign policy are "war parties" and said that the government is planning to participate in a mad adventure 3,000 miles away, rather than solving major domestic problems.</p>
<p>Washington, March 29th, Havas – The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States held its annual meeting in Philadelphia today and decided to petition President Roosevelt, demanding the construction of the world's largest air force and the recruitment of a mechanized force of two million people. In addition, it also advocated for the repeal of the Neutrality Act and the adoption of all steps to resist aggression. The original letter has been presented to the President in person by the association's president, Singel.</p>

<p>Chongqing, military news: (1) In the Longmen Mountain area on the east bank of the Yellow River, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in bloody battles all day on the 29th. There were no changes in the battleground. (2) Around 1:00 AM on the 29th, Japanese forces from Luowangcheng, northwest of the former Rongze County, used artillery to bombard Xiaocaozhuang (north of Guangwu) to cover their infantry's advance into the area. At the same time, more than a thousand Japanese troops from the old Rongze County also split into two groups and moved west towards Guangwucheng Sanguanmiao (south of Guangwu).

According to received news, the Japanese troops are currently encircling Longmen from three directions, while Chinese troops are putting up a strong resistance. People here speculate that the Japanese offensive in western Shanxi may be a diversionary tactic, as the Japanese troops gathered in Zhengzhou, Xinyang in Henan Province, and the southwest corner of Shanxi Province. Therefore, some believe that the Japanese army may be attempting to completely control the entire section of the Pinghan Railway and the Longhai Road west of Zhengzhou. (Reuters, March 30th)</p>
<p>Xingji, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Heilongguan in western Shanxi infiltrated westward on the 26th.

On the 27th, Japanese troops who attacked the area of Shijiatan (southwest of Xiangning) were met and heavily damaged by Chinese troops. On the 28th, they were once again fiercely attacked by Chinese troops and collapsed and retreated. Chinese troops are pursuing the retreating enemy. Another group of more than 2,000 Japanese troops engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops in the area of Hujialing Wangjiagou (northeast of Hejin).

<h3 id="e14">Military Commission Announces One Week of War Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Military Commission announced the war situation for one week (October 24th to 30th). A spokesman for the Military Commission stated that this week, the Japanese army suddenly gathered a considerable force in Hejin, Shanxi Province, and in the north and south of Qiji, seemingly attempting a simultaneous movement from north and south. The northern route has already been launched and has been stopped. The southern route is still in deployment. Apart from this, there were only small-scale wars in the central Hubei and central Henan areas, and China has gained some minor victories. The war progress and the situation of the Japanese invasion of Hejin are described in detail below. On the 15th, the Japanese occupied Hao Xue, entrenched in Jingzhou and Shashi, attempting to open up water transportation between Jingzhou and Yueyang. Successive attacks were launched, with 6,000 troops dividing into three routes from Cenhekou Zhuanqiao Wan on the morning of the 17th to invade southward. On the morning of the 32nd, they occupied places such as Hao Xue, Sheqiao, and Baimasi. The Japanese aimed to secure Hao Xue as a naval transportation escort point. Therefore, they successively occupied places southeast of Hao Xue, such as Zhujia Tai, Wang Zi Qiao, Yong Ping Qiao, and Pujiguan Tianjia Xu (about 35 kilometers from Cenhekou), consolidating their periphery. Unexpectedly, the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack, pre-emptively striking the Japanese rear, also launching a flank attack simultaneously. The Japanese forces were defeated. In the fierce battle until the evening of the 23rd, many were killed and wounded. The remaining Japanese troops had no choice but to retreat northward. China then completely recovered Hao Xue and Pujiguan Tianjia Xu and pursued, successively recovering Baima Sheqiao and other places, now reaching near Cenhekou, restoring the pre-war state. Recovering Guangwu: Since the Japanese crossed the old Yellow River railway bridge southward, they have made no progress in Rongze. They gathered more than 4,000 troops, with more than a dozen cannons and three tanks, and before dawn on the 21st, divided into routes from Rongze, Shifo, and Han Cheng to invade Guangwu. Guangwu fell. In the evening, they attacked Mengsai Gao Cun westward but were repelled. Before dawn on the 22nd, they also attacked Suzai, but were repelled. China then pressed toward Guangwu on the morning of the 22nd. The battle lasted until 2 p.m. when China stormed into Guangwu city. The Japanese fled back along their original routes. The city was completely recovered by China and pursued. The Japanese are still surrounded in Dongzhuang Sulou and other places, and are in the process of being formally resolved. Zhengzhou: The Japanese gathered more than 5,000 troops and raided the line from Wangzhuang Balihe Station Mazhuang to Huanggang Temple at 5 p.m. on the 25th. After a fierce ambush by the Chinese, they retreated to Zhengzhou at 3 a.m. on the 26th. (Henan Bank). In the Jin Southwest Hejin area, more than 10,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with more than a dozen cannons, have recently been added from Xinjiang, Jishan, and Fenshui counties. A unit of more than 2,000 troops raided Xishikou Yu Jia He area north on the 26th. After being blocked by the Chinese army, the Japanese suffered considerable casualties. On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese added more than 2,000 troops and raided Kejia westward. At noon, they split into two groups to commit crimes. One group of more than 2,000 attacked Shiliangmiao to the southwest, and the other group of more than 2,000 attacked Shijiatan Dongchuanwo to the northwest. On the 28th, the Japanese who advanced southwest from Kejian increased to more than 4,000 troops, and split into routes via Shiliangmiao Da Chizi to the Xialingsi Mountains, continuing to attack Longmen Mountain fiercely. At the same time, the Japanese in Zhanjiadian and other places northwest of Hejin also bombarded Donglongmen Mountain fiercely. Another Japanese unit raided Shenqian Village and nearby areas via Hejin Jingjia Dian Dujia Gou. The Chinese troops in that area were determined to fight bravely, engaging in bloody combat with the Japanese. The battle was extremely fierce. Casualties on both sides were heavy. The Chinese are still fighting fiercely. The Chinese are bypassing the Japanese flank and pre-positioning troops behind the Japanese, and are now launching offensives smoothly. (October 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The South American Crisis Under the Axis Threat <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>In his Navy Day speech on the 27th of this month, US President Roosevelt specifically revealed the Axis powers' conspiracy and the crisis facing South America. According to Roosevelt, he had obtained a secret map drawn by Germany, which arbitrarily divided South America into five vassal states and placed the entire continent under Hitler's rule, including the Republic of Panama and the Panama Canal, the lifeline of the United States. The announcement of this speech immediately aroused great attention and reaction throughout South America. Former Argentine Foreign Minister Peredang even believed that the failure of Hitler's ambitions in South America would begin with the US President's declaration that day. It is not difficult for the world to see the broad and fierce conflict between the United States and Germany.</p>
<p>Although Berlin has now dismissed this secret map as a forgery, and the US President has refused to fully publicize the map in order to protect intelligence routes, objective judgment suggests that the Axis powers must have this ambition. It is recalled that when Hitler first came to power, the Nazis established the "National Socialist Party Foreign Affairs Department" at No. 7 Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. Rosenberg was in charge of it and was responsible for expanding the territory of the "Third German Empire," which was the famous "Brown International." Rosenberg also formulated an external policy action plan, which was often referred to as the Rosenberg Plan. The main points were: (1) Organize a united international front against Bolshevism to isolate the Soviet Union; (2) Unite Italy to control Britain and France, and try to alienate the relations between European countries to achieve the effect of defeating them individually; (3) Unite Japan in the East to encircle the Soviet Union and contain the United States; (4) Actively advance eastward to seek to develop German territory in Southeast Europe and Northeast Europe; (5) Step up the expansion of armaments as a backing for diplomacy. At that time, a French person named Erust Heuri wrote two books, "Hitler's Plan to Conquer Europe" and "Hitler's Plan to Conquer Russia," exposing the content of the Rosenberg Plan to alert European countries. Unfortunately, everyone mostly ignored it at the time. As a result, over the years, the German government has not only been able to implement the Rosenberg Plan step by step, but also been able to take advantage of the situation and achieve successful results step by step. By analogy, the secret maps that President Roosevelt has obtained and seen are probably a continuation or extension of the Rosenberg Plan. Moreover, although Germany's main current enemies are the Soviet Union in the East and Britain in the West, both countries have the strong United States behind them providing strong assistance. Therefore, Germany's resentment towards the United States may even exceed that towards Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is expected that they will want to get the United States at all costs.</p>
<p>The United States also originally had an ABC defense line in the Atlantic, which was: to be able to defend the coasts of Argentina (A) and Brazil (B) to the south, and to ensure the safety of Canada (C) to the north. Since the actual establishment of the Anglo-American military alliance, the defenses of Canada and the United States have long been integrated, and even Greenland and Iceland have been garrisoned by US troops, so the situation in the North Atlantic has been considerably consolidated. The only concern is in South America. South America is full of small countries with often conflicting opinions, and its defense capabilities are naturally weak. It is also an ideal place for foreign fifth column conspiracies. This point has always constituted a disadvantage for the United States, and the United States has long discovered this and has been working hard to remedy it. As early as 1823, it issued the Monroe Doctrine to ensure that the entire Americas would not be interfered with by foreign forces. Since President Roosevelt was elected and took office in 1933, he has promoted good neighbor and reciprocal trade policies, and actively participated in repeated Pan-American conferences to enhance the unity and cooperation of the entire Americas. However, the complex environment of South American countries is still difficult to thoroughly transform at once, and it remains the object of international conspiracy activities. Since the United States closed all German and Italian consulates in June of this year, the Axis countries' espionage activities in the New World have shifted their focus to South America. For example, in the middle of last month, the Argentine Congress had no choice but to set a new precedent in diplomatic history by passing a bill disagreeing with German Ambassador Zallmann's continued stay in Argentina to carry out illegal activities. Moreover, Panama is the passage of the Panama Canal, the lifeline of the United States, and its President Arias was actually manipulated by the Axis powers until he was overthrown by a revolution on the 9th of this month. All of this is sufficient to supplement the US President's speech and shows the recent rapid encroachment of the Axis countries on South America. In the future, if the port of Dakar in French West Africa ultimately succumbs to pressure and falls into the hands of the Nazis, its distance from the eastern end of Brazil will be only 1,862 miles, and the threat to South America and the United States will be even greater and more direct.</p>
<p>After President Roosevelt's exposure and loud appeal, it is believed that South American countries will certainly not repeat the mistakes of European countries, but will be able to work together with the United States to jointly seek active and effective steps to resist aggression. Moreover, the encirclement and attack of the Axis powers on the Americas comes not only from the Atlantic Ocean, but also from the Pacific Ocean. Regarding this point, when US Secretary of the Navy Knox delivered a speech the other day, stating that "conflict in the Far East is inevitable if Japan does not abandon its expansion plan," he had already made a frank announcement, and all necessary actions to support Knox's remarks are of course being actively implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Melancholy of the French <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Third Republic was defeated. Historically speaking, a regime rarely survives such a devastating change. However, should more than 150 years of French history be disregarded? The French Revolution, and all the efforts of the last century to move towards freedom, enlightenment, and justice that made France great, should they be wiped away? The spirit and principles for which France struggled and endured for nearly two hundred years, if rejected, would be tantamount to admitting that the Nazis, who only understand force and opportunism, are correct.</p>
<p>The "Two-Month Review," published on September 15, 1940, contained an article signed by Pétain, in which the French head of state expressed his sentiments:</p>
<p>"Liberalism, capitalism, and collectivism are all imported goods to France, which France should reject. She has realized that in the past, transplanting systems and methods that were not suitable for the climate of this country was a misguided path. Only when examining the principles of the enemy's victory did she realize, with surprise, that almost everywhere she had her own assets, the purest and most reliable traditions... National Socialism has the ideal of work first and a realistic approach to the monetary system, which makes us immediately recognize it as part of our ancestral heritage. I can list proofs that guide us from all aspects to the truth that we have and unfortunately forgot, so that we do not have to borrow from others to regain it, and we can see at a glance those who know how to use this truth better than us. From this, we can see that we do not have to abandon ourselves, only restore our original appearance, and we can align our thoughts and actions with those who are about to lead the reconstruction of the world."</p>
<p>Countless French people are deeply uneasy when they think of the situation in their homeland, mainly because of this. They are willing to believe that Pétain and those who cooperate with him are truly patriotic, disregarding everything in order to save the country. However, the philosophy of these people, willing to compromise with the Nazis, not only cooperates in fact but also morally and politically, shaking the faith of those who have always argued that the name of France cannot be separated from autonomy, tolerance, and individual freedom. This kind of "truth" is indeed owned by France, not something that Hitler borrowed and is better at using than ourselves. This is the truth he wants to destroy and make no longer exist in the world.</p>
<p>Although the French government wants to preserve the life of France, it simultaneously rejects some of the main ideas that make France exist, causing many contradictions. Many who deeply care about the fate of France in places like the United States are unable to understand this, and many loyal French people are also confused and uneasy.</p>
<p>We cannot say on the one hand that we have been completely defeated by Germany, and on the other hand, remain independent. How can a person be half slave and half free?</p>
<p>Just by looking at the precedents of countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, and Denmark, we know that the claim that we are willing to cooperate with the Nazis to establish a new order is also untenable. To say that Hitler's treatment of France will be different from other countries, no matter what his promises, is almost tantamount to complicity. After we were defeated and surrendered, Britain could only fight independently for its own survival, and it is no wonder that they abandoned our country. At the Munich Conference, some French people even said that Czechoslovakia was to blame, but they did not know that France and Czechoslovakia had a treaty at the time, which was destroyed by the French leaders.</p>
<p>If we appeal to the Americans to consider the traditional friendship between the United States and France, and force Britain to loosen its blockade against France to slightly alleviate the poverty of the French, while not mentioning the looting and plundering of the German occupying forces, how can this appeal be valid? The reparations paid by France amount to 300 million yuan per year, while Germany, under the Dawes Plan, never paid more than 600 million in reparations. If the Vichy government wants to draw the world's attention to the tragic fate of France—and I fear the Vichy government should do so—it should learn a lesson from the German book and remember how Germany used the Treaty of Versailles after 1914. France is suffering extraordinary pain, and perhaps the pain in the future will increase. Who else should be responsible for it besides the Germans under Hitler?</p>
<p>It is also inappropriate to praise Marshal Pétain for respecting French public opinion more than Laval, as he repeatedly reiterated his belief in Hitler's policy of "cooperation."</p>
<p>Finally, it is also contradictory and inconsistent for the French to want to restore the traditional policy of friendship between the United States and France, while vaguely accepting the Nazi's new European order, at a time when the United States has formally declared to the world that it will never accept the establishment of this new order.</p>
<p>Since France signed the armistice treaty on June 22nd last year, every time I think of my homeland, I cannot help but feel that France is heading towards a path of increasing spiritual and moral isolation. The darkness that covers the conquered countries has now reached the other side of the Atlantic. Indeed, many French people come from Germany, and many letters that have escaped inspection are sent from time to time, but even if I meet people I deeply trust or receive letters from close friends, the feeling that France is becoming more inaccessible to me does not diminish. One of the many tragedies caused by France's defeat is that certain values that are fundamentally and intrinsically French have lost their unity.</p>
<p>I have said before that I have lived for so many years, until this past June, and never in my life have I encountered a conflict with the fact that I am a French citizen who can think freely as I please. This does not make me arrogant because I feel patriotic, nor does it give me any personal pleasure. I simply acknowledge this point, just as Americans today acknowledge it.</p>
<p>But now, not only for me, but for all French people, whether they live in France or are guests in other countries, there are some difficulties. Criticism and dissent have never diminished in France, but the basic principle of allowing criticism and dissent is somewhat precarious. French families have suffered unprecedented disintegration. All those who refuse to follow Pétain's policies are regarded as traitors by Pétain's followers. Freedom has diminished in France, and terror has taken its place. They fear for the safety of individuals and families, fear being scolded for not being patriotic, and deeply fear doing the wrong thing because the standards of right and wrong have been shaken.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be French?</p>
<p>This question can only be raised today, but there is no answer.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the answer is brewing. As far as my personal belief is concerned, I do not believe that the current policies of the French leaders, and their skeptical attitude towards certain basic concepts, are of any benefit. But on the other hand, because the issues involved are far beyond the foresight of the volatile and conquered Vichy government, they may not do much harm either.</p>
<p>This kind of problem involves the existence of Western culture itself. The form may change, but its basic concepts must not be changed in any way. These basic concepts have a history as long as ancient Greece. One of them is freedom and respect for the individual. It is true that we have misused this concept in France, but that does not prove that this concept is wrong.</p>
<p>The Nazis may temporarily defeat France, temporarily distort the French people's idea of what France represents in the world. But even if they can completely destroy France, I still believe without hesitation that France will be able to revive and see the light again. (The End)</p>

<p>United Press, Ankara, 30th. The Turkish President, while reviewing troops on the 18th anniversary of the Turkish Republic yesterday, stated, "We live on the edge of slaughter," and further declared that Turkey is prepared to make any sacrifice to preserve its integrity.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 30th. The Vichy News Agency, reporting from Diyarbakır in southeastern Turkey, states that significant progress has been made on the railway construction from Diyarbakır to the Iraqi border. This railway, approximately 167 miles long, will connect the Turkish and Iraqi railway lines. Construction is being accelerated to facilitate Turkey's transportation to the East.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 29th. It is learned that Britain has requested the United States, in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, to allocate funds to build a railway in Iran, connecting the railway line from the Persian Gulf to the oil fields with the Turkish railway network. The US government will soon send a military survey team to Iraq to study this plan. In addition, Britain plans to connect Indian railways with Soviet railways and improve rear military transportation lines on the Eastern Front. The United States also agrees with this, as this railway would be a permanent route for supplying the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 30th. According to news from New York, the US government will send a military delegation to Iraq. The delegation will soon depart for Basra, tasked with studying the construction of a railway in Iraq to connect with the Turkish railway network.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Free Yugoslav Government Announces German Massacre of Yugoslavs; Number Killed and Imprisoned in Concentration Camps Reaches 200,000 <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>International News Service, London, 30th. Representatives of the Free Yugoslav Government in London issued a lengthy statement to the International News Service, informing reporters of the situation in the country. They stated that nearly 100,000 patriotic Yugoslavs have been executed, assassinated, or massacred. Another 100,000 have been imprisoned in concentration camps. Despite these repressive measures, Serbian and Croatian guerrillas have caused at least 60,000 casualties among German and Italian personnel and pro-Nazi leaders in Yugoslavia. According to statistics obtained from the Serbian Orthodox Church by the Archbishop of Canterbury, since the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, over 180,000 Serbians alone have been massacred in the country. This number has not been confirmed by the spokesman of the Free Yugoslav Government, who stated that the situation in the so-called independent state of Croatia established by the Nazis is the same as in other parts under Nazi rule. The spokesman added that Croatian guerrillas have been joined by Serbians, operating in the mountains and forests, striving to disrupt Nazi activities. The Serbs and Croats, sharing a common plight, have united. Recent reports indicate that the leader of the Croatian puppet state, Pavelić, has been forced to "purge" several Yugoslav leaders, and Pavelić himself feels his life is in danger, so he has increased his guards and sent his wife abroad. It is also reported that the Italians are deeply dissatisfied with Pavelić's inability to subdue the Croatians and organize a strong government, and they want Duke Spoleto to succeed him. It is rumored that the Germans have repeatedly asked Dr. Maček to form a government, but Maček has refused each time. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Soviet Union's fierce resistance to the Nazis is a stimulant for their fellow Slavic Yugoslavs.</p>
<p>International News Service, New York, 30th. According to news from Europe, another thirteen people in Travnik, Yugoslavia, were executed by Nazi authorities yesterday on charges of sabotage and communist espionage. At the same time, it is reported that nine Czechs have also been executed, and four Hungarians have been sentenced to death for sabotage. Another Yugoslav has been shot near Rome on charges of "sinking an Italian ship." News from Sofia reports that several communist uprisings have been suppressed by the Germans, who have arrested people extensively in the area.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Germans Advance North from Orel, Launching Offensive Against Tula; Germans Intensify Pincer Pressure on Moscow from North and South; Adverse Weather Hinders German Supply Lines in the South <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 30th. According to last night's war report, German forces are currently attempting to advance north towards Tula, the manufacturing center of the Orel region, making slight progress. The new offensive launched by the German forces in the Orel region has lasted for seven days, with the German troops suffering significant losses. In the Donets Basin, enemy forces are currently attempting to advance east of Makeevka. German forces in the Kalinin region are taking a defensive posture at various locations, and fresh troops have been brought in to reinforce them, mainly Austrian soldiers.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th. Yesterday afternoon, Moscow Radio broadcast that German forces are currently taking a defensive posture in the battle for the city of Kalinin, about a hundred miles northwest of Moscow on the railway. It said that at least 5,000 German soldiers have been killed near the city, and 50 tanks, 40 artillery pieces, 32 mortars, and a large amount of other equipment have been lost. The German forces in the area are currently being reorganized. A German mechanized infantry division has become an ordinary infantry division due to the heavy loss of equipment. The radio station described the success of the Soviet Air Force, claiming that Soviet squadrons operating in a certain area on the western (central) front annihilated 3,000 German soldiers and destroyed 100 tanks, 600 trucks, and 6 oil trucks. In the southern front, a Soviet squadron bombed and killed 500 German soldiers near Rostov, destroying 44 tanks and 14 trucks. In the Crimean battle, Soviet forces are currently attacking the enemy, and the Soviet Air Force and the air force of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet are also cooperating with the army, continuing to bomb concentrated enemy forces. A Reuters military commentator said that the German side claimed yesterday that three German divisions, aided by aircraft and tanks, had broken through the Soviet defense line at the Perekop Isthmus and rushed into the Crimean Peninsula, capturing 15,000 Soviet soldiers and seizing and destroying 13 tanks and 109 artillery pieces. The number of prisoners claimed by the German side is not commensurate with the number of artillery and tanks, and it would only be reasonable if the number of artillery pieces was increased or the number of prisoners was reduced. Therefore, what the German side claimed is very unreasonable. It is certainly possible that German troops have broken into Crimea, but if the Soviet side's front line is indeed broken through, it will admit it and will not hide it. Recent news from the Soviet side states that the situation in this area is serious, but both major offensives launched separately by the German army have been repulsed. There is still room for Soviet troops to be deployed in Crimea, and the defenses of Sevastopol are quite strong. If the brave Soviet soldiers fight like their comrades on the northern front, the German army will find that breaking into Crimea does not mean that it has conquered the peninsula. On the other hand, General Timoshenko must withdraw the Soviet garrison from that area within the possible range to reinforce the Soviet forces under heavy pressure on the Don River. The Soviet Navy, based in Sevastopol, has one battleship, five cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, and fifty submarines, as well as a large number of transport ships. No matter how much the German side claims to have achieved a great victory in the south, it cannot compensate for its lack of success in the Moscow area. Although the Soviet side mentioned that fierce battles continued on the main Moscow front, and that German troops made slight progress in Volokolamsk, about 70 miles northwest of Moscow, the German bulletin did not mention the war situation on the Moscow front. Soviet forces are now reportedly launching offensives in areas such as Maloyaroslavets, which is an encouraging sign of the Soviet army's increasing confidence. It can be seen that the German side's silence on this front is not due to the war being quiet or the German army succeeding in its operations.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 30th. Yesterday, reliable sources here stated that the battle for Moscow has become tense, and the German forces are increasing pincer pressure on the capital from the north and south. It is reported that the weather is becoming more severe, and both armies are trapped in bottomless mud, making it almost impossible to supply heavy artillery and ammunition. It is also said that the German forces have successfully prevented the recent large-scale counterattacks by the Soviet forces in Kalinin, and Nazi troops have made some progress south of Kalinin and along a certain railway line connecting Leningrad to Moscow.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Withdraws from Kharkov after Exacting Heavy Toll</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 30th. The Soviet midnight bulletin stated that the Soviet army had withdrawn from Kharkov, the key Ukrainian city for military production, after the German army had paid a heavy price. The Soviet army withdrew from Kharkov for strategic reasons, when the Soviet command deemed it appropriate, rather than being forced to withdraw when the German army was at the gates. All important factories, railway trains, raw material stockpiles and other valuable items had been evacuated from the city. Several medium and small military factories of military significance have been destroyed. In the Battle of Kharkov, the German army suffered 120,000 casualties and lost more than 450 tanks and armored vehicles, 3,000 trucks carrying various military supplies, and more than 200 artillery pieces of various calibers. Also, in the Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets districts, the German army yesterday</p>
<p>United Press, Kuibyshev, 30th. News from the Soviet front yesterday stated that the Soviet counteroffensive had blocked the German army in the middle of the Moscow front, and pointed out that the major pressure from Kalinin, about 100 miles north of Moscow, and the entire southern and southwestern wings. It is claimed that the German army has amassed heavy tank units and artillery units, and is attempting again to break through the Soviet positions south and north of Moscow.</p>
<p>Soviet Air Force Flies to Berlin, Drops Bombs and Leaflets</p>
<p>International News Service, Kuibyshev, 30th. The Red Army headquarters announced today that Berlin suffered heavy losses in a fierce Soviet bombing raid, with fires breaking out everywhere. This is the first time that Soviet aircraft have attacked the German capital since September 4th, and it coincides with a tense situation on three fronts for the Soviet army. According to the headquarters bulletin, Soviet giant bombers dropped several tons of explosives on "military industrial targets in the German capital" and dropped leaflets in German, urging the people of Berlin to rise up against Hitler and stop sacrificing German youth. The Soviet High Command also stated today that German aircraft attempted to attack the Soviet capital again but were repelled. Only a few enemy aircraft slipped in and dropped bombs indiscriminately on residential areas, causing minor casualties among civilians. Last night, thirty-nine German aircraft were shot down over the Soviet capital.</p>
<p>Situation in Rostov is Serious, Bunkers Built Around City</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 30th. Moscow Radio claimed last night that Rostov-on-Don, a major port at the mouth of the Don River, is currently under serious threat, and fighting continues on the roads leading to the city. Bunkers have been built around the city and in the streets. In one battle in this area, the German army lost 44 tanks, 40 trucks carrying infantry, and three aircraft. The corpses of 500 German soldiers were left on the battlefield. There has been fierce fighting for a long time in the Donets Basin to the northwest. German forces broke through Soviet lines east of Makeevka, but due to strong Soviet resistance, the German army suffered extremely heavy losses and was unable to advance further. In the Crimean battle, the enemy has gained a foothold within the Soviet lines.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 30th. Moscow Radio has just announced, "All German attempts to break into Rostov have been crushed by our defending forces. The German army has been trapped in one place for several days, while our army is engaged in improving positions and launching effective counterattacks, resulting in the capture of several important strongholds. The majority of the enemy forces are now changing from attack to defense and are entrenched within tanks. "It also said that the Soviet army is now taking the initiative to attack, launching fierce attacks on the rear of the German lines. It also stated, "A fierce new battle is about to take place," but did not specify where the new battle might take place. The radio also quoted a Pravda correspondent on the Western Front as saying that the Soviet army had advanced five miles on the Mozhaisk highway, and that all German attacks on the Western Front yesterday had been repelled, without any new strongholds being captured. The radio also quoted other news from the Western Front as saying that the German offensive towards Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets, which had lasted for five days, had now been halted. With the help of reinforcements, the German army had made slight progress, but their gains were not comparable to the initial progress in early October. "Our army is almost everywhere on the counteroffensive, and is already engaged in a battle for important locations, and has occupied various peripheral areas, and is consolidating its positions in those occupied areas."</p>
<p>Soviet Union Rapidly Trains New Troops, Preparing to Send Them to the Front in the Spring</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 29th. According to the latest news, the Soviet Union still holds great hope for the current war, but its hope depends on two things: one is to rapidly form new troops and send them to the front, uniting with the original troops to defend the positions at all costs; the other is to hope that the British and American countries will provide massive assistance, which will soon be realized. The Moscow radio station especially appealed to the people tonight, vigorously stating, "We must act quickly, the enemy has launched an offensive everywhere, the motherland is in danger." The important work of continuing the war in the future lies in training reserve soldiers. The Soviet Union has a large population and endless sources of soldiers. All regions have begun to train new soldiers. A month ago, the government promulgated and implemented a compulsory military training law, stipulating a training time of at least 110 days. However, General Budyonny has formed a new army in the Don River Basin, and it is expected that it can be sent to the front in the spring to fight. The Red Army authorities are also reorganizing the defense lines east of the Ural Mountains to prevent the German army from continuing to attack. As for Soviet maritime traffic, the port of Arkhangelsk has been closed due to freezing, and maritime transport in the Caucasus region is also in danger of being cut off. If so, it will be difficult for the British and American countries to supply the Red Army with weapons.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 29th. General Sukov, the new commander-in-chief of the Red Army in the Moscow region, is currently working on training a large number of armored units to fight to the death with the German army. Some of these units have already been formed and have participated in counterattacks, and their actions are extremely rapid and invincible. At the same time, news from the front all states that rain and snow are hindering the war, but the German attacks on both wings are very fierce. In addition, there is no war in the Leningrad war zone. The Finnish army in the north has only made slight progress.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Panic Unsettled, How Can Large Sums Be Collected? Gold Rises Again, Unprecedented Surge, Generates a New High Price of 22,500 Yuan <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, on the Shanghai black market, all remaining long and short positions for the October gold contract, totaling 100 taels, were cleared. The morning clearing price was 8,400 yuan. The official opening and closing prices for both morning and afternoon were 7,800 yuan, a small reduction of 100 yuan. The spot price rose again in an unprecedented surge, exceeding the 20,000 yuan mark. Breaking the record of the 27th of this month, it soared upwards, generating a new high price of 22,500 yuan, which had never been reached before, amidst the chaos. This was due to the rumor that the Exchange Equalization Fund was determined to eliminate the city's black market exchange rates, leading to misunderstandings and rumors about normal commercial exchange settlements. Speculators, who always want to stir up trouble, deliberately created rumors, stimulating the recently calmed nerves of all parties. In addition, a certain speculative bank, after initially holding back, suddenly made aggressive moves, exchanging paper for gold, seeing it as a profitable venture. Furthermore, those from the Tianjin gang who had sold short in the previous days were covering their positions, causing the market price to soar even higher, making it difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>Spot Price Surges Dramatically by 3,500</p>
<p>The Shanghai spot price experienced another surprising surge, breaking through the 20,000 yuan mark. In the morning, amidst selling pressure from Tian Yuan and others, the market opened 150 yuan lower, at 18,600 yuan. After that, it showed a steady upward trend. Hesheng and Dafeng showed strong buying interest, Tian Yuan resumed its activity, and a new speculative bank also entered the market, pushing the price beyond the 19,000 and 20,000 yuan marks, reaching 20,150 yuan. Mingfeng and others sold, suppressing it slightly to 150 yuan. Hesheng and Fuyu continued to advance forcefully, rising to 20,650 yuan at the noon close. In the afternoon, the market opened with aggressive buying, pushing the price beyond 21,000 yuan, to 21,500 yuan, 850 yuan higher than the noon close. Xianghe and Decheng advanced aggressively, and the price rose further by 1,000 yuan, reaching an unprecedented high of 22,500 yuan. Dafeng and others saw the high price and began to sell, resulting in a drop of 1,000 yuan. Mingfeng and Tianyuan re-entered the market, pushing the price up again by more than 700 yuan. The market closed at 4 p.m. at 22,250 yuan, a surge of 3,500 yuan compared to the previous evening's close, which can be described as an unprecedented dramatic rise. The high-low range of 3,900 yuan for the day was also an unprecedented record. The branded gold of the cash shops was sold at 32,400 yuan in retail stores, with a reduction of more than 1,000 yuan for purchases.</p>
<p>Futures Slightly Lower by 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai October futures contract opened at 9:30 a.m. at 7,800 yuan, down 100 yuan. Hengji covered its short positions, with the clearing price set at 8,400 yuan. The market closed at 7,800 yuan at the noon close, and the opening and closing prices in the afternoon remained unchanged at 7,800 yuan, a slight decrease of 100 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The high-low range for the day was 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold Price Increased by 340</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at silver shops increased. Xin Da Tong Hang raised its price by 0.6 decile in the morning, up 190 yuan, reaching 1,100 yuan. In the afternoon, it jumped to 2,300 yuan, up another 200 yuan, then dropped slightly by 5 yuan to 2,250 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan), up 340 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the spot price soar to over 22,000 yuan per bar, causing even greater panic. British and American gold pounds also surged by a significant 70 yuan. British gold notes rose by one yuan, American gold notes rose by 2.4 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars rose by 0.4 yuan. In addition, Singapore, Canada, and Philippine notes also trended upward. Japanese and Korean gold notes also saw strong gains, with the former rising to 3.35 yuan and the latter reaching 2.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the official rates posted by the Central Bank and HSBC remain stable. Small counters at HSBC and other banks remained unchanged. The black market rates for British and American currencies initially eased but then suddenly tightened, as the gold price rose above the 20,000 yuan mark. Sellers hoarded and squeezed the market. After the market opened in the morning, export companies offered to sell at 3 yuan, while importers bid at 3.375 yuan. Around 10 a.m., a deal was brokered by a Chinese middleman between two foreign companies at 3.125 yuan. Later, sellers offered at the previous price. British exchange at 0.2 offices saw few buyers. At noon, the gold price surged, and suppliers suddenly became reluctant to sell, and the market softened. At the noon close, a broker offered to sell to a keen importer at 3.125 yuan.

<h3 id="e38">Large Quantities of Brazilian Cotton Arrive, Coarse Cotton Transactions Become More Frequent <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Argentine cargo ship "Normandie" came to Shanghai for the first time, having rescued eleven shipwrecked sailors on the coast of Wenzhou en route. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. The ship's captain was enthusiastic in his rescue efforts and was praised by the local shipping industry. It is now learned that this maiden voyage to China was chartered by the well-known American cotton merchant, Fu, to transport high-quality Brazilian cotton directly from Santos, Brazil, South America, totaling 30,810 bales. It is said that these were all ordered by various yarn and cloth factories in Shanghai and that delivery procedures are currently being expedited. This is said to be the largest shipment of Brazilian cotton to China.</p>
<p>The current cotton situation was flat in the morning, but in the afternoon, the unofficial market price of cotton yarn rose due to rising gold prices. Market sentiment turned bullish, and transactions became more frequent. All parties were scrambling for cotton, as the raw material for coarse cotton was becoming increasingly scarce. Asking prices were repeatedly increased, making it difficult to open transactions in the coming days.</p>

<p>The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by dealers and New Orleans, but later fell back due to selling by Southern hedgers and profit-taking by some longs. As a result, closing prices yesterday were up about 10 points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell due to hedging by cotton merchants and selling by retail investors, but rebounded due to short covering and a general bullishness in the domestic market, resulting in a gain of about 2-3 rupees. It is predicted that the market will open fairly flat today, similar to the closing market conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Government Bonds Face Another Wave of Price Declines <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds was firm yesterday morning but experienced another wave of price declines in the afternoon. The market situation was precarious, with many believing that it was affected by the rising price of gold. In the morning, Xinfeng, Shengsheng, Dashuntai, and Lemao were buyers, with Class C bonds reaching a high of 7.15 yuan. Tongshun, Yitai, Lianyi, and Hongda supplied more than demand, and the price broke 7 yuan again, down 0.1 yuan from the previous day. Short covering was not uncommon in the afternoon, with Dade, Datong, Hengkang, Hefeng, Runlisheng, and Da all covering their positions. However, sellers were very active, and Xie Kang, Hongda, and Xinfeng turned to selling again. Hengfu, Dazhong, Lianhe, and Zhenkang rushed to sell. After a period of struggle, the 6 yuan mark for Class C bonds was broken again, and the 4 yuan and 3 yuan marks for Class A bonds were also broken. The situation was not good. As a result of the close, all bonds fell back by several jiao to 1.3 yuan. Class D bonds fell the least because there was no trading in the afternoon. The total number of transactions was 1.67 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>In the stock market, 500 shares of ABC Underwear Company were traded at 21 yuan, up another 3 yuan. There were buyers offering 22 yuan after.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Distribution and Sale, Rice Weevils Discouraged, All Types of Rice Succumb to Price Declines <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>A large quantity of foreign rice at the Municipal Council's fixed price arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying 20,639 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Except for 500 bags of Hakka rice, the remaining 20,139 bags were foreign rice from the Municipal Council. The ship docked at the company's Wharf No. 4 on the Bund in the French Concession, which served as a head-on blow to speculators.</p>
<p>Therefore, the foreign rice market, after a trend of large increases and small declines in the previous dynasty, experienced an even steeper decline yesterday. This was because both buyers and sellers had weak sentiments. The bulk of the Municipal Council's rice was being distributed to various stores for public sale, and foreign firms such as Da Fu were also canvassing for transactions in the market. Da Fu offered small-grained rice at 191 yuan, with bids at 186 yuan. Li Ji Foreign Firm also had 5,000 tons of small-grained rice, priced at 175 yuan, and there were rumors that a deal had been struck. Therefore, whether they were new hoarders or scattered customers, all were eager to sell, bidding prices down and competing to sell. However, actual sellers were all watching and waiting, not daring to add to their purchases rashly. For a time, the overall situation completely changed, becoming a situation of just selling without buying. All prices fell like leaves in the wind, continuously declining from morning to noon without any recovery. No. 1 Saigon fell from an opening price of 183.5 yuan to 177 yuan, No. 2 fell from 163 yuan to 158 yuan, Silver Bank small-grained rice fell from 160 yuan to 157 yuan, and foreign bank rice fell from 159 yuan to 156 yuan, a sharp drop of 4-6 yuan compared to the morning closing prices of the previous market. However, the market immediately rose again as buyers took advantage of the small drop and absorbed the supply, pushing the noon close up to 157-158 yuan. In the afternoon, influenced by rising gold prices and favorable rumors, small-grained rice reached 163 yuan at one point, but closed at 160 yuan, still slightly higher than the previous evening by 1-2 yuan. Over 20,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Thick and thin new broken japonica rice and other types of domestic rice - since the selling price was raised, movers had a profit to make, and sources increased. Yesterday, over 500 dan arrived in port, which happened to coincide with the depreciation of foreign rice, resulting in an uneven supply and demand. The price of new broken japonica rice fell back by 4-5 yuan, with early broken white rice from Nangang opening at 191 yuan, then at 188 yuan, then at 185 yuan. New japonica rice from Kunshan opened at 189 yuan, then at 187 yuan. Qingjiao kiln rice and Fengjing rice both opened at 190 yuan, then fell to 185.5 yuan. High-quality Sijing wild rice was out of stock, and only middle-grade rice opened at 188 yuan. Glutinous rice suffered a decline in sales and fell by 2 yuan, with Hong Kong high-grade rice opening at 200 yuan, then at 198 yuan, middle-grade at 195 yuan, and glutinous green rice at 183-184 yuan.</p>

<p>Foreign flour rose as soon as the market opened in the morning, continuing the upward trend from the previous evening. In the afternoon, the rise in gold prices and the rebound in foreign rice prices stimulated excitement among the customers and hoarders, and speculators were particularly active. The market price was raised again and again. Fortress opened at 51 yuan in the early market and rose to as high as 54 yuan in the afternoon. It slightly flattened out at the close, with the price at 53.5-53.6 yuan. Golden Dragon opened at 48.79-49.12 yuan in the early market and rose to 52 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 51.5 yuan. Bran was also raised by customers to 90.05 yuan. However, since the Japanese factory released flour at 70 yuan, the sellers held firm, and no new high prices were offered.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Corn and Red Sorghum Trended Higher <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Corn and red sorghum trended higher again yesterday. This was because the price of gold surged, and hoarding was prevalent, with prices trending upward. As a result, new high prices were reached again, up 1-2 yuan from the previous highs. The total market offered 4,000 bags of spot Holan and Saigon corn and over 5,000 tons of futures. Two carts of Mingguang red sorghum were offered.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Dang Gui (Angelica Root) Rises <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The supply of Dang Gui (Angelica Root) has been scarce recently, and the market has risen along with the price increases of white goods. The company recently handled several boxes of goods from the north, and the quality of the goods was very good. The opening price has risen to 1,600 yuan. Miscellaneous red dates have been actively sought by the Hangzhou and Ningbo gangs, and the price has risen. Both Zoufu red dates and Chang red dates have risen by more than 10 yuan.

<p>The sugar market rebounded yesterday due to the rebound in gold prices. After an initial period of stability, the market tightened, and the rising momentum was strong. Futures for coarse sugar rose by around 20 yuan, and spot coarse sugar rose by varying amounts of 15-17 yuan. Refined white sugar also rose by more than 10 yuan, Dutch red sugar rose by 7 yuan, and Hong Kong coarse sugar rose by a similar amount.

<h3 id="e46">Measures to Suppress Local Commodity Prices, Shanghai and Hong Kong Steps Converge, Increase the Supply of Food and Coal, Foreign Exchange Amounts, Unapproved Foreign Exchange Cover will be Supplemented, Phelleps Explains Matters Undertaken by the Import Association Yesterday <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>After the Exchange Equalization Fund took over the management of foreign exchange in Shanghai, it supplied US$6 million in foreign exchange for imports to Shanghai in September. In October, it increased this to US$6.9 million. With November about to begin, the Fund has made a decision on how to allocate foreign exchange, and it was notified to the Chinese and foreign banks that were granted foreign exchange concessions on the 19th. The content is roughly similar to that of September and October, but the supply of foreign exchange for certain items has been appropriately reduced, while the supply of food and coal has been slightly increased. According to sources familiar to reporters, the Exchange Equalization Fund may issue a statement in Shanghai today, but officials have not confirmed this.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Requires Investigation of Foreign Exchange Cover</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from a highly reliable source that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank received a notice from the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Committee on the 27th of this month, instructing it to inform the 14 Allied banks, various Chinese banks, and the remaining three national banks in Shanghai to compile detailed statistics on the amount of foreign exchange cover applied for but not approved for essential imports before August 18th (the day the Exchange Equalization Fund began providing preferential foreign exchange), and to submit it to the Hong Kong authorities for reference. If the Exchange Equalization Fund deems that certain situations warrant consideration, it will supplement the necessary cover to maintain trade. However, this matter is entirely in the hands of the Exchange Equalization Fund, and the banking sector cannot comment. It is said that after receiving the notice, the Central Bank has informed the relevant banks, and the procedures for compiling the statistical report will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkland is About to Return to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person in charge of foreign exchange operations at a certain Chinese national bank, who had met with Mr. Kirkland, the American financial commissioner who recently came to Shanghai, told a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter that he met with Mr. Kirkland on Monday, during which Mr. Kirkland asked various questions and disputes related to the Shanghai foreign exchange market. He went on to say that Mr. Kirkland did not come to Shanghai with any suggestions for the banks to implement, but only to solicit the opinions of the banks on the overall foreign exchange situation. Mr. Kirkland did not publicly announce his mission or his opinions, and even in private conversations, he remained silent on decisive issues. Mr. Kirkland's visit to Shanghai was only to gather the most up-to-date information from American officials and the banking community in Shanghai for the Exchange Equalization Fund to use as a reference. It is understood that Mr. Kirkland will return to Hong Kong soon. It is reported that Phelleps met with Mr. Kirkland and the French authorities on the 28th to explain that the Concession planned to procure wheat flour, kerosene, and four other items on its own, hoping to negotiate with the Exchange Equalization Fund.</p>
<p>Import Association Undertakes Matters</p>
<p>Mr. Phelleps, Director-General and President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, convened Chinese and foreign journalists at the Council's conference room at 3:30 p.m. yesterday to explain the plan to organize an "Import Association" to assist in managing commodity prices. The translation of his remarks is as follows: "The Council is currently engaged in drafting measures to manage retail commodity prices within the Public Concession. In addition, the Council may take certain special measures to deal with large quantities of essential goods. For such essential goods, certain price management systems may be adopted, similar to those used in dealing with rice. At the same time, it is hoped that with the assistance of import merchants, the prices of other important goods, whether imported or manufactured locally, can be controlled. The Council relies on the voluntary cooperation of import merchants and manufacturers, and hopes that through this cooperation, as well as the cooperation of purchasers, commodity price management will be successfully achieved.</p>
<p>If Necessary, Direct Retail Sales</p>
<p>The Council therefore proposes to establish an association of import merchants and manufacturers to undertake the following matters, as well as other appropriate and effective matters that the association may find: (1) The members of the association will voluntarily maintain a reasonable level of their selling prices. (2) Assess retail prices, provide reasonable profits, and notify the Council of the assessed prices, so that they can be communicated to the public. If the assessed prices are approved by the Council as maximum prices, they shall not be exceeded. (3) When absolutely necessary, members will sell their goods directly to the public. (4) The same measures may be taken to manage the prices of intermediaries who normally engage in such businesses. (5) If an association of retailers is established, the Import Association shall seek its cooperation.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies and Banks Hope to Assist</p>
<p>The current situation is caused by difficulties in transportation and foreign exchange. It is hoped that this powerful association can obtain the voluntary assistance of shipping companies and the banking community to ensure a steady flow of goods and fair prices. The items listed in the above plan that will be managed immediately include items sold by food companies and pharmacies, such as imported or locally manufactured food, condiments, cleaning materials, medicines, cigarettes, tobacco, soap, and beverages. Import merchants or manufacturers of all nationalities who agree in principle to the organization of this association are requested to send a letter to Messrs. Beck And Swann at 17 The Bund, indicating the names of the products that their companies handle and that can be managed in accordance with the above methods. The Council will closely cooperate with the French Concession Public Works Bureau on all matters related to commodity price management. At the same time, the implementation of commodity price management will be jointly carried out by the two Municipal Councils."</p>
<p>Consular Corps Reportedly Responds</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned that the Shanghai Consular Corps had responded to the Shanghai Municipal Council's request for new regulations on commodity price management, and that the Council's organization of the Association had already drafted a preliminary plan for managing retail prices. This is a sign that the abnormally high commodity prices in Shanghai will fall soon. The details of these new regulations are not yet known, but it is heard that the Council urgently needs this privilege to control the abnormal situation, so the Consular Corps will definitely approve it. At the same time, Hong Kong telecommunications reported that the Exchange Equalization Fund has decided to increase its allocation of foreign exchange to Shanghai. As a result, the value of the legal tender should increase next month.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Also Adopts Similar Measures</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Continental News, the Economic Section of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai is currently discussing countermeasures to the recent rise in commodity prices, land prices, and rents in Hongkou. It recently issued two consular orders, one being the "Anti-Profiteering Order" and the other being the "Anti-Land and Rent Price Order," to suppress commodity prices and stabilize the lives of consumers. On the one hand, it will crack down on rent increases. At the same time, the economic police of the Japanese Consulate Police Station will also be mobilized to take decisive action against those who raise prices improperly. According to Economic Vice-Consul Gong Li, the crackdown was prompted by the current situation of high commodity prices, housing difficulties, and other profiteering activities. The aim is to achieve considerable results. It is also planned to organize a commodity price countermeasures committee composed of representatives from the private sector to be responsible for adjusting prices in the general market so that it can take the same steps as the Public Concession in suppressing commodity prices in the future.</p>

<p>Following the assassination of a German officer in Nantes, a city in occupied France, German authorities have taken fifty French citizens as hostages and sentenced them to death. The Free French government in London, led by de Gaulle, has urged French citizens to be aware of and condemn such brutal tactics. British bombers have also flown over Nantes, dropping leaflets declaring the belief that the French will ultimately be liberated. Furthermore, thirteen French citizens in Northern Bosnia have already been executed, and eleven others have had their sentences reduced to five years' imprisonment. French expatriates and sympathizers in Shanghai will observe two minutes of silence tonight at 11:00 PM to mourn the victims and will proceed to lay wreaths at the Bund Monument tomorrow to silently protest the massacre of innocent people.</p>

<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 30th - The British Embassy's Information Office released the following notice: (1) In February of this year, British nationals in occupied China, especially women and children, were advised to consider leaving unless they had a good reason to stay in the current environment. They were also warned that if an emergency occurred, obtaining convenient transportation for a large number of people would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p>Special Ship Planned</p>
<p>Recent developments have made it necessary to reiterate this warning and urge those concerned to pay urgent attention. (2) For those with insufficient financial means, the British government has agreed in principle to waive travel expenses. However, British citizens lacking sufficient funds and wishing to obtain free passage must register their names at the British Consulate-General between November 3rd and 15th. If the available ship space is insufficient, a special ship will be arranged for this purpose. However, this can only be initiated once the exact number of passengers is known.</p>
<p>Departure in Order</p>
<p>(3) It must be pointed out that the British government cannot guarantee that all those who register will be able to depart. Those who are unable to do so must be prepared to remain in place regardless of future circumstances. The situation where British citizens do not have the same opportunity to evacuate on British ships seems likely to repeat itself. If an emergency arises, priority for ship space will be granted based on the order of application.</p>

<p>There are rumors that Nazi authorities in Shanghai will soon establish a Ukrainian consulate in the city, although this has not been officially confirmed. It is known that the Ukrainian community in Shanghai has its own association, which is independent of the Belarusian Emigrant Committee. The association issues its own documents and required certifications for passports, with the nationality field on passports being filled in as "Ukrainian." Now that Ukraine is entirely occupied by German forces, it is generally believed that the establishment of a Ukrainian consulate in Shanghai is not impossible. This is because many Ukrainians here refuse to be recognized as Russians and have severed all ties with the Russian authorities in the city.</p>

However, due to local circumstances, the Shanghai branches of the four banks will not handle the payment. Bondholders in Shanghai can authorize banks to collect payments from the Hong Kong branches on their behalf.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, Mr. Phillip, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, introduced Mr. Liddell of the Fire Brigade to brief Chinese and foreign journalists. According to Mr. Liddell, the cause of the recent unfortunate fire on Sichuan Road was the large quantities of chemicals stored in the warehouses. These chemicals were not only easily ignited but also highly flammable, posing a danger to public safety. He earnestly advised all sectors of society not to store chemicals in warehouses, as this is a violation of the law. The insurance companies for the warehouses destroyed on Sichuan Road were unaware that they contained chemicals, and the owners of the goods in those warehouses have yet to be identified. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council will immediately prosecute them according to law upon investigation, sentencing them to more than six months of imprisonment. The Municipal Council and the Fire Brigade urge all sectors of society to assist in investigating whether any warehouses are still hiding chemical substances for the sake of public and their own safety, which they trust the citizens will be happy to assist with.</p>

<h3 id="e53">German Raider Supply Ship Secretly Enters Port to Load Oil; Ship Named "Quito" Arrived from Japan; Oil Already Loaded Sufficient for Japanese Military Use <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>There is currently a German ship in the Huangpu River loading diesel and gasoline. It is widely believed that this ship is a supply vessel for German raiders. It is a new, light gray color, flies the Japanese flag, and has no name. The crew is all German, including two senior German officers in black and white uniforms.</p>
<p>Loading Diesel and Gasoline</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that the ship is loading diesel and gasoline. The crew is entirely German, but there are also several Japanese officers and soldiers on board. The ship entered the port on Saturday night, October 25th, disguised as a Japanese transport ship and not subject to the usual customs regulations. It is moored at the sixth and seventh pontoons outside the Kung Wo Hsiang Wharf. According to responsible sources, the ship arrived from Japan and will undoubtedly serve as a supply vessel for Nazi raiders. The cargo it is currently loading is mostly diesel, which further supports the claim by responsible sources that the ship is a supply vessel for German raiders, as most German ships and submarines use diesel fuel.</p>
<p>May Leave Shanghai in One or Two Days</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the ship is already carrying a significant amount of oil and may leave Shanghai in one or two days. Qualified sources estimate the ship's tonnage at 4,000 tons. It is of modern construction with a funnel at the stern, resembling a cargo ship or an oil tanker. It only flies the Japanese flag, and there is no trace of the ship's name. The German crew members on board are either painting or leisurely smoking. A few crew members are assisting in loading the diesel drums, and a large quantity of canned food and fresh food has been loaded onto the ship.</p>
<p>Originally Belonged to the North German Company</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the ship previously belonged to the North German Company. This time, it sailed from Japan, along the coast of North China, and arrived in Shanghai. There are rumors that the ship came to Shanghai to load silver, while others say it is simply refueling. The ship's original name was "Quito" (the capital of Ecuador), with a displacement of 1,200 tons. After quietly entering Shanghai under the Japanese flag, it has aroused speculation from all sides. The Japanese side officially disclosed yesterday morning that the Japanese Navy had leased the ship. It has been verified that the "Quito" was built in 1938 and, along with its sister ship, "Bogota" (the capital of Colombia), previously sailed on the Amazon River in South America. The hull of the "Quito" is not freshly painted but still retains traces of green and yellow camouflage colors.</p>

<p>The Hsiang Mao Foreign Firm Doubled Allocations Yesterday; A Huge Amount of Rice Is About to Arrive in Port. Recently, prices in Shanghai have soared, and the livelihoods of ordinary people are unsustainable.

The ship docked at Pier No. 4 of the Banque de l'Indochine Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. It is said that a large number of shipments are following. In order to fully supply low-priced Hong Kong rice to the rice shops in the concession areas, the Hsiang Mao Foreign Firm increased the amount of low-priced rice allocated to each rice shop to over 16,000 bags yesterday, which is more than double the usual amount.</p>

<p>At 8:10 AM yesterday morning, five robbers, three of whom were armed, broke into the home of Chen Yuanshan, a wool merchant at No. 13 Nangaoshou Lane on Avenue Haig, and ransacked the premises. After a long period of time, they fled with the stolen goods. Chen's family immediately followed a thief wearing a Western suit. The thief exited Nangaoshou Lane and headed west along Avenue Haig. When passing the entrance of the Tongde Rice Store at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road, the victim reported the incident to Chinese Constable No. 2886.

<h3 id="e62">Gasoline Restrictions: Gas Station Employees Cheat; Three Employees Arrested After Investigation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Due to a shortage of supply, major gasoline companies in Shanghai are strictly restricting gasoline sales to users. Automobile companies and users with their own vehicles are also registered, and cards are issued, limiting the amount they can use each month. This has led to soaring black market prices. Some employees at gas stations are blinded by greed and try to cheat in order to sell gasoline at high prices. A Western employee of the Asiatic Petroleum Company recently discovered that employees at Gas Station No. 819, located at No. 222 Jiangxi Road, were defrauding the company of gasoline. On the night of the 28th, he secretly went to investigate near the station. After a while, he saw a truck adding ten gallons of gasoline. Afterwards, the employee went to the station to investigate and found that there was no card or voucher and that the transaction had not been recorded in the books. He reported the matter to the General Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Yang Zhaoqing to arrest employees Wu Keyun, Zhou Juyang, and Feng Yunxian and detain them in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special District Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu charged them with fraud and presented the case, requesting a postponement. Judge Dai reviewed the confession and ordered the suspects to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Murder Case on Shanhai Pass Road: Couple Assassinated; Carpenter by Trade, Now Selling Bean Curd at a Stall; Shot Dead Upon Waking Up Early in the Morning <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a murder case occurred at No. 131 Shanhai Pass Road in the Public Concession, where a carpenter and his wife were assassinated and killed. The victims were Guo Xiufang, a 36-year-old man from Shaoxing who worked as a carpenter, and his wife, surnamed Mou (38 years old), who was known as "Amao's Mother" by her neighbors because she had a child named Amao (who had already died). They had lived in the back room of the building for four years. Recently, Guo switched to selling vegetables due to the rising cost of living and the meager income from carpentry. He set up a bean curd stall at the intersection of Shanhai Pass Road and Datong Road. Yesterday morning, Guo's wife had already gotten up, while Guo was still in bed, waiting to get up. Suddenly, two assailants broke into the room. Without asking any questions, one of them pulled out a pistol and fired one shot each at Guo and his wife, both hitting them in the head. Guo was shot in the cheek, and the bullet exited the back of his head, killing him instantly. Guo's wife was shot in the left ear, and the bullet entered her brain. She bled profusely and was seriously wounded. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two assailants fled out the back door and quickly disappeared. At the time, a clerk from the Lu Shunxing Tailor Shop, the second landlord of the building, heard the gunshots and went upstairs to investigate. He saw the tragic scene and immediately reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. Since Guo's wife was still alive, she was rushed to Baolong Hospital. However, she ultimately succumbed to her injuries and died. Her body was sent to the morgue for examination along with Guo's body. The police have ordered an investigation into the cause of the incident.</p>

<p>Regarding the "Correction and Clarification from the Christian Charity Relief Association" in your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column on October 4th, this letter was not approved by the entire association and was published by Tan Qiuyin in his individual capacity. Since the association has no chairman title and Mr. Tan's fundraising theatrical performances and accounts have not been handed over to the association, the refugees have not received any benefits. Therefore, it was resolved at the regular meeting yesterday to correct the previous letter as inaccurate in order to avoid misunderstandings from all sectors of society. This is to inform the editor of the Shen Bao newspaper. Sincerely, Dong Shaoru, Zhang Qiling, and Hu Duzhou, Initiators of the Chinese Christian Charity Relief Association, October 27th.</p>
<p>Sir: I am writing to you on behalf of the representative of the Quan Tai Transportation Company. Having read the report in the Shen Bao newspaper titled "Fire in Cichang Lane, No. 423, Sichuan Road," which mentions our company, we have found that the report is inconsistent with the facts. Our company's Second Warehouse was previously located at No. 11 Cichang Lane, Sichuan Road, but our lease expired on April 5th of this year. Afterwards, the warehouse was leased by the Zhong Fa Transportation Company. Therefore, the report is based on inaccurate hearsay. We hereby request that your lawyer write to the newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Song Yunhui, October 30th, Addressed to the Editor-in-Chief of the Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Nanjing Ginling Women's College: Service and Experimental Work <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>During the August 13th Incident, Nanjing Ginling Women's College, besides moving the main school to Chengdu, retained faculty and staff in Nanjing. After the dissolution of the refugee camp originally established by the school, the service department colleagues, recognizing that many of the refugees were women with secondary school education levels, and since there were no girls' middle schools established in Nanjing at that time, which was a great pity as they had no access to education, started an experimental course similar in nature to a middle school. Classes began in the autumn, with five grades established, enrolling over 180 students, and with more than 20 faculty and staff. At that time, society's economic capabilities were weak, so students were divided into two types: self-funded and work-study. Self-funded students paid the minimum fees, while work-study students paid according to their economic ability, with over 20 students not paying any fees at all, and some books were even provided by the school. Self-funded students only studied and did not work, while work-study students, in addition to taking necessary courses, also had to learn handicrafts, with the aim of emphasizing vocational education so that they could support themselves after leaving school. "In terms of teaching," the curriculum was divided into general and special subjects. The general subjects were the same as those in ordinary girls' middle schools, but with an emphasis on practicality. No matter what the subject, if practical exercises could be added, they were added, hoping to have as much connection with daily life as possible. Special subjects, in addition to the general subjects, were set up to meet the needs of women's environments. For example, high school seniors had the opportunity to select six special subjects in one academic year, namely child psychology, basic architectural knowledge, horticulture, literary history, accounting, medical common sense, and first aid, each of which could be completed in six weeks. High school freshmen had teaching methods for blackboards and flower arrangement, etc., and students could freely choose one or two to study. Junior high school sophomores had a home economics course, with sewing taught in the first semester and cooking, home decoration, and bookkeeping in the second semester. "In terms of work-study," any poor student could apply to the school for a work-study request form before the end of the semester, which would then be personally investigated in detail by a dedicated social work teacher during the holidays, visiting each family, and then reporting to the work-study committee for approval of the amount of work-study, which would be implemented in the second semester. The types of work were assigned according to the student's physical strength, talent, and interests, and the amount of work time was determined based on the amount of work-study. Work included weaving (weaving socks, towels, gauze, spinning wool), copying (writing stencils, drawing charts, typing), teaching in elementary schools, managing the library, selling textiles, and hosting students' families, etc. At the end of each semester, the teachers in charge would calculate wages on an hourly or piece-rate basis and report them to the accounting office. In addition, the work-study scholarship set a quota of dozens of students per semester. Any work-study student who ranked first in the school or had excellent conduct could be exempted from all fees for one semester, and those whose grades exceeded the specified points could be exempted from tuition and miscellaneous fees. Such scholarship recipients accounted for a strong third of the total student population.</p>

(2) Government agencies entrust professors to engage in research according to the following procedures: A. If it is certain that a professor is competent for a certain research project, the entrusting agency shall send a letter to the original school to obtain consent before entrusting it, and at the same time send a letter to the Ministry of Education for filing. B. If the professor who is competent for the research project has not been determined, send a letter to the Ministry of Education to find a candidate for entrustment. (3) The entrusted professor shall submit a work report within the prescribed period. (4) The entrusted professor shall still serve in the original school and receive the original salary. (5) The entrusted professor may make full use of the library facilities of the original school and may request the school to provide other conveniences.

It is reported that the school has made preparations after receiving the order and will officially start classes on the 22nd of this month.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Airmail) This year's high school graduates, limited by the enrollment quotas of various universities and colleges, who have been unable to continue their studies, number as many as four or five thousand, and are likely to drop out of school. People from all walks of life are very concerned. The reporter specifically asked someone from the Department of Education about this issue. According to the answer, the department will order all universities and colleges under its jurisdiction to set up preparatory classes as much as possible to provide these students with the opportunity to continue their studies, and will also discuss with Sun Yat-sen University to take the same measures to accommodate as many students from war zones and overseas Chinese as possible, and provide as much convenience as possible to maintain the youth's studies.</p>

<p>The final act of the charity basketball game for student aid, the third battle between Blue-White and Paramount, was originally scheduled to be held today. However, most of the players on both sides are students, and they have to take care of their studies. Therefore, it was decided to postpone it again to the end of the week so as not to interfere with the players' studies. At the same time, the end of the week is also a holiday, and it is expected that the number of spectators will increase to increase the income of the charity. The organizers decided to postpone this unprecedented event to this Sunday (November 2nd), and in order to show the importance of the event, they specially invited Zhou Xinfang and other eight famous male and female actors to host the grand closing ceremony at the venue. At the same time, the ball game will be publicly auctioned. The grand ceremony of good balls will be held at the same time, and all the programs and times will not be changed. All tickets sold are valid as long as the ticket surface is marked with the words "Blue-White vs. Paramount Third Battle".</p>

<h3 id="e85">Daylight Saving <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession are going to turn the clocks back one hour again starting at midnight on November 1st. In this place at this time, the citizens have already made the greatest effort regarding savings. The performance of this daylight saving movement has been quite good, and now, due to seasonal factors, the authorities can call it a halt.</p>
<p>Daylight saving is perfectly suited to us; it has already fulfilled its responsibility of correcting the irrationality of urban life. A group of people who plan during the day and party at night will at least be partially affected. Who doesn't love the light of nature? Who doesn't love the blue sky and the white sun? We might as well enjoy the caress and cleansing of the sunlight as much as necessary, especially for patients, who must be illuminated. Sunlight is originally very suitable for their health.</p>
<p>At this time, we can still examine ourselves: Have we eradicated the bad habits of decadence, delay, photophobia, and fear of welcoming the sunlight? Have we truly invigorated our bodies and minds and advocated getting up early and working early? Has our spirit been mobilized? Have we been living a transformed life?</p>
<p>If the answer is "no," then you have wasted daylight saving. Daylight saving is necessary in any context, which cannot be limited by whether the clock is moved forward or backward. If you are preoccupied with this point, then its effectiveness is limited, and moreover, in terms of the "orthodox" relationship of China's central standard time, there will be some misunderstandings. We want daylight saving, spiritual saving, material saving, and saving everything for our future.</p>
<p>When I first hear the rooster crow, I feel deeply inspired. This is not a bad sound! Everyone, work hard and continue to save time. In the end, we must have light, but then we must first cultivate the habit of liking to see the light!</p>
<p>Here, we express our gratitude to the authorities for promoting daylight saving in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Such Students <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>During class, the professor discovered that a female student had not brought her textbook, so he approached to inspect the items on her desk. He counted: a mirror, a box of face powder, and a tube of lipstick. Just as the professor was about to change color in a rage, he suddenly saw a pencil placed in the corner of the desk. Thinking that it was used to take notes, he turned anger into joy and did not investigate anything. Afterwards, the female student said to her friends, "Fortunately, I even brought my eyebrow pencil that day."</p>
<p>A friend of mine, a man of great talent, has been studying at the university for more than six years, but there is still no news of his graduation. The reason is that he has always been in love with Miss Y, a lower-classman, and has been pursuing her for many years, but with no results. However, he is not discouraged and is willing to stay in school, using reading as a pretext, so that he can see her morning and evening, hoping that one day his wishes will be fulfilled. Unexpectedly, Miss Y's heart is as tight as iron, and she secretly said to others, "Even if Mr. So-and-so is the only person left in the world, there is still no reason to agree." As soon as these words came out, my friend was as if he had been granted amnesty. As soon as the semester ended, he immediately obtained his diploma.</p>
<h3 id="e87">We All Hate How Hard It Is to Be Human <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Yang</p>
<p>— Whose Fault Is It?</p>
<p>"Oh, it's really like sugar-roasted chestnuts, it's hard to make a living!" Mom sighed with emotion, and threw the vegetable basket aside, and took out a few vegetables from the basket:</p>
<p>"Clover is selling for five or six jiao a catty, foreign potatoes are nine jiao to one yuan a catty, lean meat is six yuan a catty, and two jiao worth of bean curd doesn't fill a small rice bowl... I really can't buy it anymore!" Obviously, Mom is used to complaining.</p>
<p>"Ayang, think about it, today I only sold half a catty of clover, one catty of foreign potatoes, and a piece of meat that is so thin that the wind can blow it away. Plus a few hundred pages and a bowl of bean curd, two and a half yuan are gone! Oh..." While saying this, Mom took the vegetable basket and went to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Wait, Mom came out with a look of worry on her face again. "The briquettes are going to run out soon, and they're saying outside that they're going to be nineteen yuan a load today. I told you to call earlier, call earlier, but you didn't listen. Why don't you go call!"</p>
<p>Obviously, Mom is angry, but with a tone of sympathy and emotion. In fact, I, who have a monthly income of about one hundred and fifty yuan, am living in this year where it costs eight yuan to open the door every day, which is really a bit "that!"</p>
<p>But the newspaper can't be ignored. Although Mom is nagging, I can only pretend not to hear it and hold the newspaper. It seems that this can relieve the boredom a little, but what I turn to is not: "Cash is rising without end: it once exceeded 20,000 yuan," but "Raw yarn rose to the limit for the thirteenth time."</p>
<p>Looking further: "Rice hoarding ghosts are active, Saigon No. 1 jumped 182 yuan." "Soaps and matches are soaring." "The sugar market is trending higher again."</p>
<p>In short, daily necessities are all soaring.</p>
<p>The more I flip through the newspaper, the angrier I get, so I simply throw the newspaper away to avoid adding more trouble. So, I'm too lazy to eat breakfast! I replied to Mom and went out to work—putting off this unsolvable problem and letting the inner chewing suffer for a longer time. Because the speculators and hoarders will not be moved by the starvation and freezing deaths of some people, then even if you die, it is in vain.</p>
<p>In the evening, when I got home, I had already crawled into the quilt, and Mom came again: "My shirt and robe are broken, and now a piece of cloth costs at least a few yuan. Even if there are old quilted shirts and flannel, the work will cost ten yuan, so it will take at least forty yuan to make it!" While saying this, her voice was a little hoarse, and obviously, she was crying, but in the darkness, I couldn't see.</p>
<p>The next day, I silently and stubbornly took my quilted overcoat to the pawnshop and exchanged it for one hundred and twenty yuan, and gave it to Mom to solve these problems imposed by others.</p>
<p>The prices of various things in the newspaper are still rising every day, and it is really going to break our throats. I worry about how long we people (who occupy the largest class in society) can live!</p>

<p>"Even if I could, to be honest with you, Mr. Qian, she is the person I love in my heart, and I would never want her to casually go on stage."</p>
<p>"So, she will definitely sing in the opera!" Qian Ruomo raised the chicken finger on his right hand that was smoked as yellow as wax with a cigar and pointed randomly to the west. "But this Red Stage is not a small place. If she shows her face here for the first time, there will be a lot of hope in the future."</p>
<p>"Mr. Qian, I really don't know how to thank you for your kindness." Qiu Haitang turned his head and looked at the great writer who smoked cigars like a volley of gunfire. "But this child is really my life. If she can go on stage, I don't want her to hang a second sign! At the moment, let alone her skills are not enough and my face is too small, even if these two things are not a problem, I don't have so much money to equip her with the necessary attire. If there is no attire, the top sign cannot be hung. I have sung in the opera for more than ten years, and I roughly know the situation inside. With my child's current skills and some of my own old face, at most, I can hang a nine or ten sign here, which is already thanks to you, sir! But like this kind of role that is neither high nor low, private attire cannot be missing, and two or three staff members cannot be missing either. These capitals are not something that I, a poor bum, can think of. What's more, even if I spend these capitals, I may not become popular? So, Mr. Qian, for the time being, I absolutely do not plan to teach her to go on stage." (250)</p>

<h3 id="e91">英茵's Past and Present <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Unsigned</p>
<p>英茵's refined acting on stage has long given drama enthusiasts a deep and unforgettable impression. Her voice is clear and bright, her stage presence is steady, and her acting expressions are exquisitely polished. She is a rare and outstanding talent in today's arts.</p>
<p>Before the war, she played in "Devil of Desire," "Wu Zetian," and "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," among others. Among these plays, "Wu Zetian" was the most successful. She captured the unique personality of this fierce and violent female emperor, just as Jiang Hong captured the insidious, shrewd, and capable appearance of "Empress Dowager Cixi" in "The Palace of Grievances."</p>
<p>After the war, with great ambition and aspirations, she went to Chongqing to develop, and later transferred to Chengdu, Changsha, Hong Kong, and other places. The plays she performed included "The True Story of Ah Q," "Remnants of Mist," "National Glory," and "Long Live China."</p>
<p>"Remnants of Mist" is Lao She's proud masterpiece. On the day of the premiere, Lao She was also a guest in the audience. He seemed very pleased with what he saw. After the performance, he went backstage to visit 英茵. In addition to praising her talent for acting, he also offered a lot of golden words of encouragement, which 英茵 will always remember.</p>
<p>"National Glory" and "Long Live China" are two plays with a sense of justice. 英茵's thoughts after performing them were:</p>
<p>"The script is really well written. My passion naturally follows it. I know that the audience's passion must also be greatly stimulated and soar because every sentence, every line, is alive, and it lives in our hearts."</p>
<p>Last year, she returned to Shanghai and, at the invitation of Minhua and Dafeng Film Companies, solemnly filmed Fei Mu's original work "Children of the World." This play depicts the world in turmoil and the ripples in the sea of people, and from the private feelings of children, it evolves into the vicissitudes of the times. In the play, she played the role of "Daughter of the Times," which suited her personality very well. Director Jacques Frolic once said:</p>
<p>"If 英茵 can study harder, her future is limitless."</p>
<p>Other films she has made include "Fragrance of Resurrection," "Sai Jinhua," and five or six other works.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Drama Society decided to perform Cao Yu's latest work after "Metamorphosis," "Beijing Man." In the play, there is a fierce and insidious young mistress named 會思懿. Friendship requested 英茵 to guest star, and it is said that she has agreed. Moreover, she also expressed her opinion:</p>
<p>"I really like performing dramas, but since coming to Shanghai this time, I haven't been on stage. The reason is that my body is often uncomfortable, and there are conflicts with filming time, and there are no scripts that suit my personality."</p>
<p>英茵 is from Beiping, and her parents have passed away. Now she is alone in Shanghai. In addition to her love for drama and literature, she also likes to raise dogs.</p>
<p>Looking back at her past and present, there is not a moment when she is not pursuing life in humble learning, which is very correct. An artist's attitude should be compassionate, and an artist's behavior should be especially serious. Those who are spoiled and lazy, self-destructive trend followers will never have a future and are only groping in the dark.</p>

<p>— 琪華</p>
<p>Not long ago, I bought a copy of Xia Yan's "Chronicle of a Besieged City" in a bookstore. After reading it, I felt very moved. What is written inside are all the current realities of Shanghai. In recent days, the market has been very turbulent, the price of gold has soared, and commodity prices have also followed suit, rising like they are flying. Shanghai people are almost suffocated under the burden of life. In such a difficult and turbulent period, various kinds of people have emerged. They have their own different ways of dealing with the world, so what they get is also different fates. Just as described in the "Chronicle of a Besieged City"; like Zhao Fuquan, who hoards and speculates, He Jinfang, who is cunning and insidious, Li Yanyun, who has a clear understanding of life, and Zhao Wan and his wife, who are cliquish...and so on.</p>
<p>If these characters are seen on the stage, they will definitely be more intimate and familiar than when seen in books. The Yinqian Drama Troupe will perform this play at the Lanxin Theater on the 2nd of next month, day and night. This is at least a very happy message for me – someone who has never seen a performance of "Chronicle of a Besieged City."</p>

<p>The famous chess player Mr. Xue Weihan has written articles in this journal introducing international chess and welcomed correspondence for research. After that, he received many letters from all sides, all of whom are deeply interested in this art but are struggling to enter the doorway and want to buy chess pieces and chess scores. Mr. Xue, due to the lack of sources for these chess pieces and chess scores during the war, cannot prepare them one by one. He has specially organized the International Chess Association at No. 9 1/2 Guangfu Lane, Yuema Road, Qingyun Society, to provide free face-to-face instruction to promote it.</p>
<p>Brief News The Bees Voice Drama Troupe is organized by amateur personnel from the city's industrial and commercial circles. It has been established for more than half a year. It is currently rehearsing the one-act plays "Moonlight Sonata," "Divorce," and "New Woman," and "Flowers Splashing Tears," which are scheduled to be performed at the beginning of next month. The company also welcomes amateur personnel from the industrial and commercial circles to participate. Those interested, please go to No. 194 Burke Road every evening to register.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18 Vow to Sweep Away the Huns, Not Caring for My Own Life</p>
<p>At first, San Gui received special promotion from the late emperor and shouldered the heavy responsibility of the General of Liaodong. I have always admired the prestige of the King. But according to the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, friendship should not cross borders, so I did not dare to make my name known. I trust that the King also understands the duty of a courtier. Now, because my country is isolated on the right side of Ningyuan, San Gui is retreating to Zhenshan Sea, thinking of firmly defending the eastern border and consolidating the capital. Unexpectedly, the rebel bandits defy Heaven and violate the pass. How can they accomplish anything with their thieving and disorganized mob? But the people's hearts in the capital are not firm, and treacherous parties opened the gates to let them in. Unfortunately, the late emperor died, and the nine temples were reduced to ashes. Now, the rebels have usurped the title of emperor, plundering women and wealth. Their crimes are extreme. They are truly the likes of Red Eyebrows, Green Forests, Huang Chao, and Lu Shan, who are resented by both Heaven and men, and whose hearts are separated. Their defeat can be waited for immediately. My country has accumulated virtue and bestowed benevolence, and the people's yearning has not disappeared. Among the members of the imperial family in various provinces, there may be those who can revive the country like Duke Wen of Jin and Emperor Guangwu of Han. Righteous armies have already risen far and near, and urgent messages are flying like stars in Shanxi and Jiangbei. San Gui has received great favor from the country and laments the suffering of these people. He is guarding the border gates, wanting to raise an army to comfort the people's hearts. But the area east of the capital is small, and the military strength has not yet gathered. Therefore, I earnestly seek assistance. My country and your dynasty have had friendly relations for more than two hundred years. Now, without any reason, we have suffered a national disaster. Your dynasty should be moved with compassion. Moreover, rebellious and treacherous subjects are not what your country should tolerate. Eliminating violence and cutting off evil is great obedience; rescuing the endangered and supporting the overthrown is great righteousness; extricating the people from water and fire is great benevolence; reviving the extinguished and continuing the extinct is great fame; establishing prestige and settling hegemony is great achievement. Moreover, the gold, silk, and children gathered by the rebel bandits are countless. Once the righteous army arrives, they will all be theirs. This is also a great benefit. The King, as a world-renowned hero, is encountering this time of crushing the decayed and rotting, which is truly a difficult opportunity to obtain again. I beg you to consider the loyal words of the orphaned minister of a perished country and quickly select a few soldiers to enter directly into the Central and Western Xie. San Gui will personally lead his troops to join forces to resist the 　Gate, destroy the rebel bandits in the palace, and show great righteousness in China. Then, my country's repayment to your dynasty will not only be wealth, but also ceding land to repay you. We will never break our word. Originally, I should submit a memorial to the emperor of your dynasty, but I am not familiar with the etiquette system and dare not lightly profane the sacred wisdom. I beg the King to forward the memorial. (206)</p>
