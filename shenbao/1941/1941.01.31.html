<p>社評</p>
<h3>新四軍的解散</h3>
<p>中國軍事委員會對於新四軍予以解散的處分，這與中國國族存亡績絕所繫的抗建問題相對比，或與多數國族悠久運命所繫的歐戰問題相對比，或與太平洋大西洋前途安危所繫的美國援助中英希問題相對比，眞可視爲不足齒數而不成爲問題的小小事件。但內外多方面對此事件，未必盡能很客觀的權衡重輕，分別大小；社會間頗成爲流行的話題，他國人士亦頗表示其關切，幸災樂禍者的張揚其辭更不必說；而軍委會方面一再披露關於這一處分的經過情形，逈不同於前此處分韓復榘石友三輩時的輕描淡寫，殆亦因見到多方面對此事件的逾分注意之故。惟因多方面逾分注意，記者亦願略言觀感。</p>
<p>在一個月之前，記者嘗以「有關中共的傳說」爲題，有所評述；論旨無他，要在諄勸新四軍遵令調防。其時，軍委會的調防令已下，而新四軍虛事委蛇，抗不奉命，更以種種跡象，不得不歸解散。中央對於此事，最初如何委屈求全，最後如何忍無可忍，其間如何複雜的行迴曲折，有上月中旬報載軍委會發言人的談話，以及近日報載何應欽與白崇禧二將軍在決定解散新四軍之前所致朱德彭德懷葉挺項英的齊電原文·司作參證·無待記者贅言。凡是讀過那談片與齊電的人，了然於前因後果之餘，必不免於痛心歎息吧！蓋在抗建的陣營之內，還有這一部分的若干將校，外不能體認侵略所加於國族的威脅危機，矢忠竭誠，專心　力於所負作戰使命；內不能體認軍令與戰略乃爲整個戰爭中必須尊重的經緯，亦爲爭取最後勝利所必須保持的基調；而猶有如那談片與齊電所指述的種種現象，這不能不認爲出乎一般想像之外，</p>
<p>對於此事，中國人與中國的友人，同深歎息痛心；不但歎息痛心，頗聞憂疑之談。或以爲這是國共分裂的初步。其實：這是軍紀問題而不關政治問題，這是解散了新四軍而不是處分了共產黨，這是咎在新四軍的一部分將校而非痛絕彼新四軍的全部將校士兵，凡此岐異，必須分別認識淸楚；分別淸楚之後，此事無論怎樣發展，不會得到國共分裂的當然結論；况共產黨現在所持有的信徒與聲譽，實以接受三民主義與擁護抗建國策爲其主要成分，爲其主要基礎，倘若共產黨的一部分人因不滿於新四軍的解散而怨及國民黨，則此事決非所謂國共分裂的初步，而是共產黨內部對於接受三民主義與擁護抗建國策是吾繼續的分裂初步，因爲它們主要成分與基礎，實繫於此。或以爲這是使抗建力量爲之削弱的措施。其實；抗建力量雖貴乎深厚，然而不貴乎雜駁不純；力量的結合與運用要在統一，允要在紀律，奢錯綜出入於紀律則不但不成爲力量的搆成分子，且必因彼此抵消而影響及於其他力量的功能；故淘汰是正常的演進，亦是力量的表見，此其意義蓋與「相踐」絕異，更與「削弱」相反。或以爲將得爲叢歐雀，爲淵毆魚的結果，徒自樹敵。其實；備具民族意識的人，加了民族主義的熏淘，民族至上，決不遊移，而遊移分子却始終是不可恃的危險分子；我們固無從深知新四軍平時所訓練所部勒者以何者爲基本觀念，然今日中國所從事的鬭爭，旣非政治鬭爭，復非階級鬭爭，而是民族鬭爭，則解散新四軍的處分又何至動搖及於軍中人的民族信念？總之，這些憂疑雖由於愛護中國的殷切，然亦由於對現實的隔膜；新四軍存在之日雖不容吾認其爲一宗力量，然力量的估價必以服從紀律爲前提，必以對於抗建的實際貢獻爲衡量。前提不立。則貢獻等於零，估價等於零。</p>

<h3>國府擴大紀念週席上　蔣委員長之訓詞　說明解散新四軍經過</h3>
<p>重慶（績昨）我相信黄帝子孫、斷沒有一人甘人爲日人張目、所以在今天如果還有將已解決了的新四軍問題、輾轉傳說、誇大其詞的、那就只是爲造謠者作應聲蟲、凡是我愛國軍民、是斷不曾受其迷惑的、而且我相信一定是斷然予以唾棄的、大家要曉得、我們爲什麽過去不將新四軍這件違法亂紀事情宣布呢、因爲新四軍乃是國民革命軍之一部、而本席乃是國民革命軍的統帥、我常說、我們革命軍、就是一個大家庭、所以我平時看待自己的部下、猶之於家長之看待他的子弟、子弟良好、固然是家長的榮幸、如果子弟不良、亦就是家長的恥辱、因之新四軍、過去雖然有種種罪惡、我總認爲是我統帥的責仟、爲了克盡自己的責任、爲了愛護自己部下、我只有不斷的警吿、隨時的督責、總希望他們</p>
<p>覺悟自新能走上革命成功的道路、眞正　國家民族來努力、而不願將他們的罪惡揭露出來、以致斷絕他們自新之路、而使他們爲全國軍民所唾棄、這是我所不忍的、可是我這種苦心、並不能感動他們、而反以爲中央是柔弱無能、甚至以爲我對他們有所忌憚、竟以影響國際視聽與分裂內戰爲宣傳、更不惜使日人知道我們內部的弱點、用這種手段來相威脅、試問一個部下的行動、放肆跋扈、荒謬絕倫、其用心之惡劣、乃至不惜以對對方揭發本軍弱點爲工具、來恫嚇上官、如此倒行逆施、還可容忍嗎、其實新四軍在長江南北、種種對中央違法亂紀的行動、日軍何嘗不知道、而且比我們知道或更明白些、所以我們決不是爲怕日人、或國際間知道而不致宣布他們的罪狀、我之所以始終隱忍、還有一點重要的意義、就是我們中國社會、無論對朋友對部下、向來有一個最重要的道德、就是</p>
<p>隱惡揚善本席平時待人、向本此旨、何况自已的部下、於公誼、爲袍澤、論私誼如家人、部下的榮辱、就是我上官的榮辱、部下的功罪、就是我上官的功罪、所以他們的通失只有由自己担負起來、非到萬不得已、決不情　宣布、但是他們違法抗命、破壞作戰、到了如此程度、那我還能隱忍姑息麽、如果冉不出以斷然制裁、就要動搖國策、國家就有滅亡的危險、大家看過聖經新的的、都知道基督的敎條、訓勉一般人對於罪人須要饒恕他七十個七决的罪過、而現在新四軍的罪過、早已超過了七十個七决以上、我們就以萬分的寬大爲懷、對於道種怙惡不悛、執迷不悟的軍隊、也決不能再隱忍再饒恕、否則就是我們自己犯罪、就是我們貽害國家、要我爲千古罪人了、大家更要知道、軍紀是全軍上下共同心理所公認共守的信的、沒有階級的分別、沒有特殊的例外、也不能有偏差的待遇、</p>
<p>上自統帥下至士兵、在軍紀之前、一律平等、如果有人違犯軍令、破壞軍紀、而統帥因循苟且、甚至姑息養奸、不能依法制裁、那我統帥就不能辭其責任、全國軍隊、亦就無法作戰、所以我們爲求得勝利、爲保障國家的生存、不能不尊重軍令、整飭軍紀、使全軍上下一致瞭然於軍紀的森嚴、大家在森嚴的軍紀之下、共同勉力於神聖的戰事、來完成我們挽救國家、復興民族的使命、大家都曉得日本爲什麽到今天要陷於泥淖的深　，不能自拔、就是因爲他們的政府、沒有維護國法執行紀律的能力、以致要陷整個命運於今天這樣的境地、他們發生九一八的事變、就是由於一般少壯派自由行動、不服從政府命令、他們政府亦沒有制止的能力、因此繼續的有所謂「五一九」的事變、演成　役軍人慘殺他內閣總理的罪行、更有他所謂「二二六」的事件、竟在他的首都殺害元老重臣與重要閣員、乃至佔領議會、搗毀政府、到了最後、所以就在七七事變、挑起東亞從未有之戰禍、來摧毀文明、這都是由於日本軍隊敗壞軍紀、日本政府不能飭紀綱之所致、但是日軍到今天之所以還能暫維現狀、還能在我國繼續作戰的原因、還是靠着他們軍部仍能保持着</p>
<p>服從命令的習慣、日官兵縱令心中厭戰反戰、不願作此侵略無益的戰事而仍舊勉强服從作戰命令、我們可以說日本巳紀綱蕩然、而前綫軍隊都勉强維持着戰鬥紀律、這就可見爭死生於呼吸的戰事、全靠指揮有效、與命令貫澈、日軍師出無名的侵略戰爭、而他的官兵尙且不敢抗命、何况我們此决抗戰、完全是爲抵抗日人的侵略、爲保障民族的生存而戰、我們全國軍民更應該如何自動覺悟、一不借生命、貫澈命令、違成任務、來維持國家紀綱與軍紀的尊嚴、然後纔能保障我們抗戰的勝利、求得國家民族的獨立自由與平等、只要我們全國各部隊從此以後、嚴守紀律、服從命令、遵照統帥部所規定的計劃、和指定的任務、切實執行、我們政府必定一視同仁、扶持愛惜、使他們遇能在抗戰歷程中有所貢獻、而獲得光榮的成功、現在新四軍番號旣已取消、這個問題自然是完全解決、再沒有其他問題了、我們政府向來是寬大爲懷、對於任何部隊、無不加意愛護、至於我個人居全國統帥的地位好像看到自間的子弟受到這樣不名譽的處罰</p>
<p>只有悲痛、只有慚愧希望全軍上下、大家要把此次事件、視爲我們國民革命中最大的恥辱、視爲我們抗建史上最可傷心的一頁、要以新四軍爲殷鑑、從此服從命令、遵守紀律、不侵犯友軍的防地、不妨礙友軍任務己不勾引友軍的士兵、不刦奪友軍的械彈、不收集民槍、不沒收民糧、不騷擾地方、不殘害人民、而且更進一步、要全國軍隊皆能保護人民、安定社會、允其對於在淪陷區的民衆、格外要全力愛護、使得我們全國軍民親愛、精神團結一致、那未由於此决新叫軍事件所留給我們的悲痛、而激發我們全軍上下抗戰建國的信心、自能因禍得福、更可以造成我們國民革命軍全軍將士的功業、總之、這次處置新四軍事件、完全是積極的、而不是消極的、主耍的意義、完全爲加强抗戰、</p>
<p>語其要點、就是（一）打擊日人妄翼我軍紀敗壞、內部分裂、以弱抗建力量的妄想、（二）申明軍隊的紀律、使全軍得所觀感、而振奮自愛、爲國效命、因而加强我們團結抗戰的精神、因爲第一點、如果日人知我國有自由行動、妨碍抗戰、殘害友軍的軍隊、而可不與制栽、則其輕視我國家、藐視我軍人、更將益甚、而侵略野心亦必將從此更熾、現在我們斷然執行紀律、加以制裁，依法解決、日人就沒有幸災樂禍的餘地、第二點、如果我們所有軍隊都知道政府以前忍的隱苦衷、是爲了抗戰、今天執法如山、也是爲了抗戰、大家都以此决事件引爲殷鑑、就不會再有違令干紀的行動、從此全軍一致在擁護軍紀、服從軍令、一條心思之下來抗建、再不曾延玩命令、再不會襲擊友軍、以自呑併防區、擾亂地方、陷害人民、那就是國　精神上走上進步道路、而加强了團結，也加强了抗建的實力、要知道命令的貫澈、和軍紀的執行、是保證</p>
<p>抗建勝利最要的關鍵、也就是國家生死存亡之所關、政府有沒有抗建的能力、是不是具備革命性、視其能否執行紀律而定、軍隊有沒有保衛國家、和抗建的誠意、亦就要看他能否遵守紀律、與接受紀律而定、唯有嚴守紀律、服從命令的軍隊、纔是抗建的眞正力量、必爲政府與人民所一致愛護、反之、若不聽命令、蔑視紀律、放棄作戰仟務、甚至侵襲友軍、减少抗建力量、此種軍隊、若聽其存在、則國家就必致滅亡、不僅抗建不能成功而已、最後我要各位注意政府此决制裁新四軍、旣然完全爲整肅軍紀、當然不牽涉其他問題、這决處置新四軍、純然爲制裁違抗命令、危害抗建的軍隊、對於其他遵守命令、努力抗建的軍隊、固毫無關連、也絕無什麽政治性質、現在抗建期間、凡遵守抗建綱領之一切個人團體和黨派、政府絕對尊重其應有之自由、與獨立之人格、而予以</p>
<p>法律保障只要不是利用武裝軍隊、抗拒政府法令的行爲、就是偶有牽涉法律的問題、政府亦必根據法律正常手續來處置、我常常對一般朋友說、我們抗建到現在雖然勝利日近、但還不能說已經脫離危險時期、當此生死成敗之重要關頭、全國上下格外要小心謹愼、不好有一事因循苟且、不好有一事輕舉妄動、否則就要使我們抗建的大業、功敗垂成、但是政府絕不能因小心謹愼之故、就事事苟且偷安、甚至並責任也不追究、速紀律也不執行、這樣國家、根本革命亦必無成功之望、政府所以忍痛制裁新四軍、其原因就是在此、其意義也就在於此、希望全國軍民同心一致、嚴守紀律、服從命令、共同協力、克盡職責、來完成我們國民革命的使命、逮到我們挽救國家、復與民族的目的祇要我們大家集中心力積極擔當偉大的抗建任務、我相信我們抗建光明的前途、就在目前了、（二十九日電）</p>

<p>國際軼聞（一）</p>
<h3>日本政局的近况</h3>
<p>日本廣知報前發行人富萊休回返美國　所作「未被檢查的報吿」，本報已譯載過「美日關係惡化的現階段」一篇，茲再將「日本政局的近况」一篇，譯錄如下：</p>
<p>日本國內爲着內政和外交兩項問題，正遇着嚴重的紛爭。內政方面，政府爲實現極權政策，曾創立所謂新體制，但極端派對於新體制實施的方式，意見仍甚紛岐。在外交方面，一部份擁護政府對蘇聯親善，另一部份則絕不信任蘇聯。</p>
<p>去年七月五日，日本曾發生政治陰謀案，當時有號稱「神兵」的激烈份子多人，企圖暗殺前任首相米內海軍大將及宮內省大臣松平兩人。日本警察即在當天捕　「神兵」二十八名，但有主謀嫌疑的陸軍砲兵大佐橋本匪特逍遙法外，且已在新體制的指導機關大政翼贊會中榮任理事了。</p>
<p>橋本曾在一九三七年十二月間充任長江沿岸日本砲兵指揮，美國砲艦「潘南」號及英國軍艦「飄蟲」號被　案即係他主使。他是過激派日本靑年黨黨魁，該黨的有黨員五百萬人，因此他有左右新體制運動的勢力。</p>
<p>其他不穩現象到處都是。但這故不是說軍權高於一切的時期即將過去，實際上不過是極端派份子之間，互相火併罷了。日本的自由主義者都已退避三舍，自由主義在極權政治下已被視爲「大逆不道」了。</p>
<p>日本極端份子的力量，現在究竟怎樣浩大，可從十七名」神兵一驚人的舉動上看出來。這些「神兵」因在一九三六年陰謀暗殺已故海軍大將齋藤暨政府高級官員多人正由東京大審院加以審訊。月前該院傳到各被吿，檢事長三橋宣讀公訴狀時，各該被吿藉口三橋不了解新體制，竟拒絕聽取公訴狀，揚長出院而去。當時三橋檢事長要求法官採取必要步驟，維持法院秩序，整飭國家紀綱，免使司法制度遭受嚴車影響。但法官略事思索之後，即　檢察長不管被吿在塲與吾，照舊宜讀公訴狀了事。</p>
<p>一星期後，暗殺犯多人，包括暗殺前任首相濱口，前任藏相井上，三井會社前總裁團琢磨等犯人在內，都在慶祝日本紀元二千六百年的機會中，獲得大赦，恢復自由，凡此都可證明極端派的得勢。</p>
<p>現任首相近衛於去年七月組閣成功，事前也曾經過一度不流血的革命。一般人以爲他旣二次上臺，必將成爲獨裁的首相，或將連任十年之久，不致像近年來的動輒更易了。但目前的情勢，很難使近衛久居其位，極端派份子的傾軋使他左右爲難。甚至傳說「神兵」亦會企圖狙擊近衛，有子彈一顆，擦過他的臂膀，但也無從護實。</p>
<p>日本極端份子共分兩派；一派主張近衛應在天皇庇護下，成爲國民領袖；另一派希望近衛或他人，能仿照歐洲獨裁者的形式，獨攬大權。</p>
<p>其中主張勤王的居多數，他們認爲歐洲的極權主義和日本的極權主　根本不同之點，就在日本天皇的地位是至尊無上的，務須永世不替，近衛等人雖可成為民族領袖或政府首腦，但小可侵犯皇權。近衛本人也抱這種見解，似無效法希特勒或墨索里尼的野心。但也有希望近衛激底實行獨裁，回復到德川幕府時代的局面的。</p>
<p>新體制運動在去年九月雷厲風行，似乎滲入國民生活的每一部門了，但月來顯因下層民衆的反抗及實施的困難而銷沈下來。日本各報最近也特別說明，欲使　體制恢復生氣，需要另下功夫。</p>
<p>日本外交政策，也如治絲益紊，日德義三國軍事同盟條的並不被人重視。日本當初所以加入該的並非出於任何合理的政策，其主要的原因無非是一部份素來親　德義的份子，如前任駐義大使白烏之類，在慕後促成罷了。</p>
<p>近衛內閣在三角同盟吿成後，現又更進一步，想與蘇聯親香，並擬與之談判互不侵犯條的。蘇聯在八年之前，本已提議和日本締結這種條的，但被日本置諸腦後，直到如今纔舊事重提，不免令人奇怪。</p>
<p>但是日本輿論及軍部，反對和蘇聯妥協的，仍居重要地位。溯自一九〇五年日俄戰爭以來，日本人向視蘇聯爲世仇，大部份人始終不信任蘇聯，參加過日俄戰爭的軍人，更難忘當年同仇敵愾的心理，其中如荒木大將等人仍爲這派激烈份子中的有力人物，會公開反對近衛。</p>
<p>但荷屬東印度問題足使日本在太平洋方面釀成東大事故，其性質自更見重要。日本人對於這一問題又分兩派：一派主張利用外交獲得開發該地經濟的最佳條件；一派主張不顧一切，攫取南太平洋的富源。</p>
<p>日本因不能征服中國，故想向別處另覓出路，以補償損失。日本倘能取得荷屬東印度的富源，則不管侵華戰事結果如何，也算有了交代了。</p>
<p>近衛內閣本來不擬採用激烈政策，攫取荷屬東印度，但商工省小林最近赴該處與荷蘭當局談判，一事無成，空手而回後，日本乃又急躁起來，躍躍欲試了。</p>
<p>總之，日本現在只有一個見解一致的問題：就是切望結束對華戰事，愈快愈好。日本的「東亞新秩序現已超出了界限，而視對華戰事爲其別種重大發展的牽制焉。</p>

<h3>納稅特會積極準備　日揚言拒不出席　惟與法定人數絕無影響　警務當局採取嚴密防範</h3>
<p>納稅外人特別大會、自於前日由丹麥駐滬總領事兼領事團主席希爾正式通吿於二月五日下午二時三十分在跑馬總會大看台重行召集後、各方對當時大會舉行情形及結果等極爲關切、但據昨晨日方報紙宜稱日籟納稅人將一律不參加二月五日重開之大會、但工部局方面認爲日總領崛內業已提出保證、如大會重開、不再發生同樣事件、故仍準備按期重開、並由警務當局採取各項嚴密戒備措置、以防不測、</p>
<p>日納稅人　拒不參加</p>
<p>日方報紙所載、日籍納稅人拒不參加二月五日大會之決定、乃前日日僑馬路聯合會常務委員會開會議決者、其理由爲日納稅人協會會長林雄吉業已充分批評工部局財政方針之不當、並已明顯表示日納稅人反對工部局所提加捐百分之四十之原案、此項決定於昨日由各馬路聯合會提交日納稅人協會討論、該會之常務委員會因此於昨日下午一時假日本總會舉行特別會議、一方商討不參加特會之決定、一方選舉新會長、以代因槍擊工部局總董凱自威而被日領署警局逮捕羈訊之前會長林雄吉、據一般猜測、此項決定、可望由該會通過、二月五日特會重開時、日納稅人席上將寂然無人也、</p>
<p>大會可足　法定人數</p>
<p>衆信日納稅人所以拒不參加重開之特會者、是因企圖使大會不足法定人數而再度延會、但據昨晨工部局某職員宜稱、納稅外人大會之法定人數爲合格票數全部之三分之一、而日方票數（非日納稅人數）估計不及全數（的計二萬八千票）之半、故除非多數非日籍納稅人缺席、即日籍納稅人屆時全不參加、大會仍得屆法定人數、通過之議案白當完全有效、預測大會於二月五日重行召集時、因上次已經討論之議案不再重複、僅由表決日人所提關於加捐案之修正案處開始、節目减辦一半、故大會可望於一小時內結束、衆信工部局董事會所提增加市政總捐地捐附稅等一案、屆時當能通過，</p>
<p>臨時舉債　應付急需</p>
<p>至工部局稅收方面、因有時於納稅外人特會對於加捐案之決定、故今年年初應收之春季照會捐房捐及地捐等總數的計一千五百萬餘元、尙未徵收、原望於二十三日大會通過後、即行徵收、但因發生意外而延期、故工部局財務當局或將臨時舉債以應本月底必需之開支、如職員薪給及債務利息等、按工部局董事會議決之加捐案、乃由今年一月起至四月納稅人年會舉行時止、以後稅率則須於年會中決定之、據工部局總董凱自威在二十三日納稅外人特會席上報吿謂此决加捐如延至四月後實行、則本年度預算仍將虧蝕、因工部局本年度預算因職員津貼等增加甚多、開支增加達二千萬元之鉅也、</p>
<p>林雄吉業　已受初審</p>
<p>據昨日英文大美晚報載稱、跑馬廳案正兇正林雄吉、已由本埠日領署法庭以預謀殺人罪予以初審、彼於星期一日解往領署法庭、領署職員等曾搜得詳盡之證據正式起訴、按事後之第二日、據可靠方面之消息、林雄吉將經日領署法庭初審後、解往日本長崎受全部鞫訊、依日本法律治以應得之罪、但一般人對於林雄吉是吾將解往長崎及解往長崎後是吾治罪兩點、頗感與趣、而表懷疑、又據日文大陸新報載稱、日本領事法庭、以預謀殺人罪將林雄吉羈押後、二十七日下午二時半、日領事法庭檢察官加藤、及日方官員曾押解林雄吉至跑馬廳大看台出事地點、實地察勘、由林雄吉演述當時槍擊工部局總董凱自威及日籍董事岡本之經過情形、的四十分鐘之久、據林雄吉答覆大陸新報記者之問話稱、開槍者我也、現靜待一切之後果、他無可談、</p>
<p>新表決票　重行分發</p>
<p>工部局秘書處、以前發爲納稅人在上决大會中應用之表決票、大多皆已遺失、故決於日內另發新票、票以絲色卡紙精印、納稅人憑此票入塲、外人除有特別情形者外。一槪禁止入塲、屆時警務當局將在會塲門口派中日英印各國警員檢票、並在會塲內外暨主席台四周嚴密防備、以維治安而策安全、又會塲佈置、因於上次大會出事、秩序混亂中被人毀壞、由工務處加緊修葺後、現已改觀、屆時大看台上淸潔之座位、主席台四周鮮美之花飾、以及高大完整之蘆蓆棚、又將四千餘納稅外人及工部局各外籍董事等相見矣、</p>
<p>增稅方法　又一建議</p>
<p>昨日有一西人、致函字林西報、建議向證券交易所徵稅、强補工部局財政、略稱、凱自威在上次外人納稅會中回答提案時、曾稱如有任何關於征稅法之提案、祇須此提案在法定能力內、工部局將時時準備對之加以週密及詳細考慮、余謹要求工部局考慮對任何與交易所有關之事務、增加百分之一稅率、閱下表即可知利用此法、可得鉅款、（下表爲過去之交易額）一一月三日　四三·〇四二·九〇〇元一月十日　五二·九二八·七〇〇元一月十七日　九二·八五二·一〇〇元一月廿四日　六九·〇三四·三〇〇元總結　三五八·八五八·〇〇〇元如抽以百分之一之稅率、（向賣者及買者各抽千分之五之稅率）總額爲二·五八八·五八〇元·則一年之總額將爲三三·六五一·五四〇元、减去所估計缺乏的費用、將爲一三·六五一·五四〇元、再用增加汽車和狗的執照費辦法、（兩者均爲奢侈品）或可超過一千四百萬元、即可用以付工部局之債務、减輕工部局之負債、此辦法若實行、決不致引起外人納稅會中之困難、余信該提案會議一定能全體通過、而上次會中不體面之行動、亦可避免、</p>
<h3>各業今日復市　滙劃莊去年度營業優異　獲利最鉅者約百餘萬元</h3>
<p>銀行業同業公會會員銀行及洋商銀行公會各會員銀行、春節休假三天期滿、昨起一律開市營業、錢業公會會員錢莊、以及錢兌業公會會員福祿壽喜錢兌莊、準今晨向公會報到上市、聞滙劃莊除滋康瑞記莊將改爲有限公司、及惠豐莊暫緩上市外、其餘各滙劃莊福源等四十一家、則完全上市、錢兌莊除改組者外、雖定今日起上市、但因外滙黄金外幣等市塲昨已開紅盤、所以實際上昨已恢復交易、至於新設立之有限公司錢莊、即將次第開業、</p>
<p>紅盤交易</p>
<p>各業市塲除黄金股票外滙外幣已於昨日複業做紅盤交易外、各商品市塲如豆米·雜糧·棉布·紗花·糖·藥材·五金·紙·等、均準今日恢復茶市、開做紅盤交易、各業工廠均已定期開工、各公司行號今日起完全復業、各綫莊準今日起提前恢復送摺、以便與各業往來、預定元宵節以前送竣、</p>

<p>去年營業</p>
<p>民國二十九年度之錢業、各滙劃莊因格守法令、僅存放款利息及按日計算、因此獲利亦較往年爲多、聞某莊獲利一百零二萬元、爲錢業之首位、惟各錢兌莊買賣外幣經營外滙黄金證券、以及投機等交易、所以獲利頗厚，聞獲利數百萬者甚多、尤以投機黄金之各莊爲最甚、各業方面、獲利最多者爲五金棉紗布疋洋雜貨等、</p>

<h3>洋米湧到期間　預防囤積牟利　去年春節米價條漲可為殷鑑</h3>
<p>米市今日開業、洋米湧到、價將傾跌、惟以去年每石四十元之米價、與今年八十五元相較、則每石已高漲達四十餘元、　去年總結東期、因米價高漲、米商見有利可圖、遂向外洋產區、大量訂購、至春節過後、因洋米大量擁到、各米棧均有不能容納之勢、存底數亦達百萬餘包以上、致每石米價、銳落十餘元、但以後被擁有大量游資之投機份子所收購、致當時米價復行上漲、每石致達百元、</p>
<p>米市現狀</p>
<p>目前因大量洋米之湧到、米價之下跌、是在意中、惟下跌後、仍須防止投機份子之囤積牟利、使價格再度上漲、故甚盼兩租界當局、預籌一妥善方法、在未有具體辦法之前、市塲交易、須遵守客售與行、行售與號之辦法、則本市民食前途、庶可無虞、</p>

<h3>愷自邇路昨晨血案　季翔卿被擊斃　黑色長袍者二人同伏弄口　共發四槍兩彈中季之要害</h3>

<p>開設銀號　自任經歷</p>
<p>季翔卿、江陰人、現年三十六歲、寓居法租界愷自邇路一七四弄、即芝蘭坊七號二樓西廂房、在公共租界寗波路大樓九十四號房間開設滙源銀號、自任總經理、又兼任「中央儲備銀行上海分行專員」、置自備汽車一輛、號碼爲三四三八號、甫於去年慶曆年底僱用甬人陳和英（現年三十四歲）爲汽車夫、</p>
<p>突遭槍擊　彈中要害</p>
<p>昨晨九時四十五分許、循例赴滙源銀號辦公、當時季身御條子玄色西裝、外罩皮大衣、頭戴深灰色呢輯、足登革履，儼然一大腹買登車後、甫開出弄口、詎有衣黑色長袍者二人伺于里側、瞥見季之汽車行近、袖出手槍、向季速發四彈、均由玻璃窗洞穿而入、兩彈命中其要害、一彈射中右太陽穴、一彈擊中後腦、血如泉湧、痛極而踣、開槍人見目的已達、送囊械飛奔而逸、</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖內河航業　日方壟斷計劃　外商無法立足華商全體排斥　但將遭遊擊隊活動限制無疑</h3>
<p>據航業界消息、日方「華中內河輪船公司」、巳擬就統制江浙兩省整個內河航運之計劃、內容殊為龐大、為長江以北擴充一線、由現有之南通如阜線擴經東台泰縣、至仙女廟、再向西至蚌埠懷遠一帶、江南則擴充十二線、以蘇州·常州·杭州·無錫·上海·崑山·丹陽·爲中心、</p>

<h3>工部局發表去年份　上海生活統計　米房租煤球激漲度日困難　一家生活最低須用百元餘元</h3>
<p>據工部局去年份年報所載工業社會處之統計部分報吿稱、近因生活費用增高至速、本處按月所編製暨發表之華工暨西僑生活費指數及工人實際收入之研究對於調整工人收入頗稱有用、若干商店及工廠依照本指數之變動而從事調整者甚多、本處每週又發平均零售物價表、用爲米貼及物品津貼之標準者、亦復不少、至於來處商詢此項問題者、均經詳答、由此可知本處所供給之材料、在社會服務方面、頗關重要也、大要如下、（甲）一九四〇年上海之生活狀况、</p>
<p>西僑生活</p>
<p>本局暨公衆期待甚殷、遂以一九三九年十月至十二月、三個月中調查所得之家庭消費平均數量爲權數、先編本埠支薪階級西僑生活費臨時指數、</p>
<p>綜合指數一九四〇年零售物價、逐月升高、故西僑生活費臨時綜合指數、其全年趨勢亦均不斷向上、從未回低、本年之指數爲一四九·一五、年初猶在一一四、四八、至十二月而爲一八〇·二一、較一月增六五·七三點、平均每月增六·四一點、國幣購買力與一九三九年十月之基期比、一月减百分之一二·六五、至十二月又續减至百分之四四·五一、十二個月中、美僑總指數增五九·四一點、英六二·七八、俄六七·六一、其他僑民增六六·六二點、其中以俄僑指數所增爲允甚、</p>
<p>華工生活</p>
<p>工人生活費總指數、本年自去年之二〇三·二五增至四三八·二二、國幣購買力與一九三六年幣値較、本年又自去年之四角九分二厘跳至二角二分八厘二毫、計降二角六分三厘八毫、本年總指數惟三月四月八月較低、十二月總指數爲五七九·七〇、較一月增二五四·二六點、平均每月增二三二點、本年一月、國幣購買力猶爲三角零七厘三毫、至十二月减爲一角七分二厘半、本年所增最多者爲食物類、其决爲雜項衣着燃料房租等類、歲杪、食物類指數已越六百五十關、燃料類五百五十關、雜項類四百五十關、</p>
<p>零售物價在指數中、工人消費品以米燃料及房租之權數較其他爲重、此三者以米爲允甚、一般物品、俱見在漲、而三者之漲、所關允大、自應提出分論、　（a）米　事變尙米發生、二號粳米、零售每石僅一一·〇六六元、一號秈米一〇·三七三元、本年二月、二號粳米漲至四五·四二七元、一號秈米則代以二號西貢米、亦漲至四五·三一二元、三月二號西貢略跌、繼因雨量過少、五月外匯大縮、價又上漲、八月再回、自十月以來、繼長增高、每石竟達八一·八〇二元、較本年一月增百分之一二〇·四九、較一九三七年七月增百分之六八八·六一、</p>
<p>（b）煤球一九三七年七月、平均每百斤祇售一·一〇〇元、一九三八年爲一·九四七元、去年爲二·五七三元、至本年一月爲四·二七七元、五月漲至八·一五〇元、六月至九月略回、十月又漲、十二月至八·三八八元、較一月增百分之九六·一二、較一九三七年七月增百分之六六二·五五、</p>
<p>（c）房租本年七月至十二月六個月中、平房較去年增租百分之一七·七六、較一九三七年七月增二七八·五五、石　門樓房較去年增二八·〇一、較一九三七年七月增二三九·六六、房租增高、不僅加重負擔、且居處擁擠、術生問題、實更重大也影響生活費用之凶素</p>
<p>本年之中、雖有若干月份、躉售物價下跌、外匯亦見好轉、然零售物價米見低落、故華工、西僑生活費用、未嘗因此稍蘇、躉售物價、在本年前五個月、上升最烈、六七八三個月回低、此後叉復上升、躉售物價上升、零售物價亦即隨之而高、然自六月至八月、零售物價、却未見减、對於生活費用之影響、不言可喻、外匯匯率、時上時落、對於生活費用之影響、較之低而穩定者、更無可取、滙率一縮、物價驟升、長則不動如故、故上落愈頻、物價愈高、綠每决底盤、有增無减也、試就零售物價與外匯匯率二者之逐月起伏、作一繫聯硏究、即可爲證、（乙）工資工作時間（祇限華廠）（未完）</p>

<h3>經濟業談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>木炭（一）</p>
<p>木炭，爲薪材之餘燼，亦即燃燒未盡之炭質。在煤未盛行前，冬禦寒，庖烹調，工鍛冶，皆用炭。</p>
<p>炭之發見最早，蓋知有火食，已用柴薪，炭因爲柴薪燃燒自然之結果。至厝薪舉火專窰燒製而成之炭，即通常所謂之木炭，其經過燒製手續，又有大量生產，供大衆需求，遂成爲商品之一。</p>
<p>中國人民之用炭，上古時代　有之。如尙書中有「民墜塗炭」，（見仲虺之誥），以泥塗之塗喻水，以木炭之炭喻火，猶謂「民墜於水火之中」，可知炭之應用甚古遠。至於燃薪成炭，周秦之間，亦有文字可尋，如禮記月令，「草木黄落，乃伐薪爲炭」，可知矣。</p>
<p>炭爲柴薪所燒製，故產地不限於一隅，但亦必以山鄉饒林木者殆得燒炭，如江浙一帶所用之炭，多來自溫台一帶，蓋以其地多山，薪材無虞匱乏也。</p>
<p>北方諸山，童山濯濯，故不產木炭，多用石炭。石炭即煤也；以其出於壙中，堅如石，黑如炭，而以爲名。前漢書地理志中所謂「豫章郡出石，可燃爲薪」，即石炭之類也。川中多產竹，故亦用竹燒炭，名爲竹炭。宋陸游老學庵筆記有一云：</p>
<p>「北方多石炭，南方多木炭，而蜀又有竹炭，燒巨竹爲之，易燃，無烟，耐火，亦奇物。卭州出鐵，烹煉利於竹炭，炭皆用牛車載。」</p>
<p>至於烰炭，大都從炊竈餘燼，置於餅甕中，上加蓋，或以濕紙封其口，杜空氣流通，即成炭。本名浮炭，謂投之水中則浮故也。其實烰浮古音相同。至白樂天詩中，「日暮半爐麩炭火」，寫作「麩」，後人仍以用烰字者多。老學庵筆記稱，「陳無已手簡一編中，有十餘篇，皆與酒務官託買浮炭，其貧可知」。可見宋人尚　之爲浮炭。並曰「其貧可知」，足徵浮炭比其他之炭廉，亦即爲烰炭之火力較弱。但烰炭生火易，煤炭欲易引着，恒取烰炭爲煤，爲其質比他炭鬆之故</p>
<p>嘗聞前人有團爐共話飲酒之雅興，蓋當時無今之煤爐水汀設備，（現除少數都市及都市中少數人家外，大多數尙仍以炭取暖），故生活優裕之家常圍爐取暖，可以煮酒，可以烹茗，可以談心，一舉而數得。夫爐何必曰團，蓋圍者，狀其圓也，圓形之爐設於中，四周之人可圍坐，遂亦名其爐曰圍爐。其後以爐之不雅觀也，乃用一大銅盆，而以刻花繪金朱紅髹漆之圓形木　爲座，爇條炭於其中，火光熊熊，滿室爲春，問有投香料及紅棗於炭中，以殺烈臭之氣，故亦名爲火盆。如紅樓夢記賈氏除夕行禮，允氏房中，地下滿舖紅氈，當地放着象鼎三足泥　流金琺瑯大火盆；又如賈母正室火盆內，焚着松柏香，百合草，想見華麗富貴氣象。（未完）</p>

<h3>接財神</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>昨天晚上是一般商店吃「財神酒」的日子，今天據說就是「財神日」。於是各大小商店就此「開門大吉」了。</p>
<p>但是，現在的接財神却有兩種方法：一種是用猪頭三牲，香燭元寳，敬之祇神靈的狀態下「接財神」的；另一種是用現代化的科學武器—白朗林，來「接財神」的。其實，說句笑話，我們在今天的不應受神鬼宿命論的束縛，已經是不用否認的事了，所以，假如是「現實」一點的話，倒還是第二種方法來得直捷爽快。</p>
<p>不過這決不是說，在下是在鼓勵大家去接「活」財神而有意擾亂社會治安，這是故意誤解的說法，但這裏說明接「死」財神是吃「空心湯糰」的「把戲」，却是必須指出的。你想，即使是憑空想，而根據傳說說是財神有五個，那末接的人家實在太多了，那些「泥塑木雕」的，人們想象中的「財神」，眞叫大有其「應付不下」的之苦，不過為了「叫不出聲」，大家聽不到而已。可是，我們却必須說明接死財神，也還有着「現實」的一面—肉荘，蠟燭店…等等的南號，倒是先就接到了一大筆「財神生意」。這大槪也是叫做頗知「兵法」者的「旁敲側擊」之衛吧。但苦的到底還是那些吃「空心湯糰」的朋友們！</p>
<p>所以，我說，在今天，我們還是求「實惠」一點的好，迷信，空想是得在我們手裏「送終」的，不過，得注意，「實惠」也還得有條件—誰是誰非！</p>
<h3>上海托兒所成立　職業婦女的福音</h3>
<p>— 安民</p>
<p>有許多反對婦女就業的人，總是把孩子問題作為論爭的法寳。甚麽孩子是一「未來的主人翁」啊，婦女一就業就免不了疏忽了孩子—也就是置「未來的主人翁」於不顧。這罪名着實不小。因此婦女回到家庭去，便成了天經地義。</p>
<p>但其實，也不盡然。「孩子問題」是可以解決的，而且在別的國家也不乏先例。就是組織托兒所。</p>
<p>現在上海女靑年會已經組織了一個上海托兒所。地址在白利南路三七號B同仁醫院內。即日起在慕爾鳴路三二三號女靑年會內開始登記。遠在去年七月間，她們就組織了一個籌備委員會，聘請專門人才担任委員。詳細計劃考慮，如今功德圓滿。眞是職業婦女的福音。</p>
<p>托兒所不單可以使職業婦女的育兒問題得到解決，就是對於兒童本身也是一種幸福。因為所內護士，保姆都受過專門訓練，對於兒童生理，心理素有研究。其次兒童在集體生活中長大，羣的觀念自然會深印在幼小的心靈上。我們的未來的主人翁應該是集體主義者，決不是暖房裏的花朶。</p>
<p>因為初次創辦，所以該所名額暫以一百名為限。至於入所資格如下：</p>
<p>一，父母須有職業而入款不能負担兒童適當敎養者。</p>
<p>二，經醫生檢查而無疾病者。</p>
<p>三，測騐智力及格者。</p>
<p>四，須由團體或個人介紹，詳塡登記表。</p>
<p>五，有特殊情形而經調查屬實者。</p>
<p>至於兒童年齡暫定初生至三足歲。在所年限暫定一年。重辦手續後可以繼續。（欲知詳情可向女靑年會索取簡章。）</p>
<p>但萬事起頭難，所以女靑年會當局竭誠地渴望社會人士的贊助和合作。現在她們需要下列物品：</p>
<p>匹布，毛巾，玩具，傢具，便盆，奶瓶，奶粉，肥皂，毯子，被胎，磅稱，醫藥用品等。</p>
<p>各界人士如願捐助者請送至女靑年會上海托兒所辦事處收。或通知上列地址，以便派人收取。熱心人士如願認捐現款者亦可。認捐者以兒童為單位，每人每月認捐給養費二十元，每年二百四十元。</p>
<p>托兒所是一種社會事業，大衆羣策羣力才能有美滿的收穫。現在正是所謂「春節」的時候，有錢的人何處不可省下一點錢呢，倘能用來造福兒童，造福社會眞是功德無量！</p>
<h3>大飯店</h3>
<p>— 淇水</p>
<p>大飯店，挺「體面」的大飯店，生意着實鬧猛，每個房間全轟吵着客滿。</p>
<p>每個房間起碼一桌麻將，二個導女吧！</p>
<p>趙大爺和馬小開二人，坐在軟綿綿沙發上，手裏雪茄，嘴邊UB，安適地釘緊看一方又一方密排着照片。旁邊四方桌上滿攤麻將牌，李行長與王買辦枯坐着麻將牌發呆。</p>
<p>『馬小開，這隻「賣相倒嘸啥。」趙大爺終於很感慨的開口了。</p>
<p>『好，再揀一隻，喊茶房「就那個鑲金牙齒的老生意吧。」二人活像在買貨色，挑精揀肥地恣意宰割。至此才『茶房，茶房！』茶房很快的應聲而入。</p>
<p>「打個電話去，一定要這個！三號，七號，快點！」趙大爺聲色俱厲。</p>
<p>茶房老鼠似的剛退出，那邊甬道上來了個大腹便便的人，室內頓時騷動了：</p>
<p>『噢，張老闆，請坐，請坐，…。』</p>
<p>『都在這裏，巧極，巧極。』張老闆剛撲的坐下，王買辦趕忙燃雪茄，倒UB</p>
<p>『咦！你們怎麽牌也不打？』張老闆覺得奇怪。</p>
<p>喏，三缺一啊。馬小開偏歡喜叫人，麻將說要慢慢打。』趙大爺伸寃似地搶着喊。</p>
<p>『坐下來，坐下來，不是一桌。</p>
<p>『麻將牌開始活躍：「嘩拉拉。」</p>
<p>茶房又老鼠似的探進頭來</p>
<p>「先生，」點弗錯，三號，七號來哉。』</p>
<p>「哈，快裏嚮坐，快裏嚮坐。」四個人異口同聲，眼睛有的張得挺圓。有的咪做一條線。</p>
<p>鶯聲滴滴：『小張你等久了。』</p>
<p>『過來！七號陪陪張老闆打牌！』馬小開絕對神聖正經的發出命令，張老闆確是座上有「顏色」的貴客。</p>
<p>…中人笑聲震耳。</p>
<p>八圈終了，算算賬。大西洋去。』張老闆把牌一推，呵口氣，覺肚子餓了。</p>
<p>『唔，時光還早，茶房拿戲報來！』</p>
<p>『對！元旦三天戲目可來得道地，結棍。』這時馬小開方把三號從身旁推開，懶洋洋開始啟口。</p>
<p>「嗯，不過，桔子先得預先買好，遲了可…。」鼠頭壓耳的王買辦最精細，樣樣想得到。</p>
<p>『那打個電話去，定個包廂好了。』趙大爺大顯神通，輕易的把兩手一攤。</p>
<p>張小開隨手抽五十塊錢給三號七號：『晚上再陪我們去看戲。』</p>
<p>『謝…。』眼淚却向喉嚨內咕嚕的滾下，不覺一個噴嚏『阿羞！』</p>
<h3>擠和推</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>熱鬧人人歡喜，「年初頭」，湊個趣兒，東也一穿，西也一猛擊鑽。穿不過，擠；鑽不過，推！擠推之不過，則形成「一字長蛇陣」，也蠻好白相格…</p>
<p>因為，「一年一度」，平時不看見的都出來了；平時成績不聽見的也出來了；總之，統統出來了！於是乎你擠我推，盛况的確空前，但並不絕後！</p>
<p>一月二十八日，不！是「年初二」，遊藝塲，電影院，塞得滿坑滿谷，買不到票是不肯走的；反正擠擠推推，望望看看，也算「不虛此行」。</p>
<p>槍砲聲旣聽不見，硫磺氣又嗅不到。乘今宵，圖歡樂，大家擠，大家推啊！</p>
<p>不過也得留心點兒別給誰擠下黃浦江，那是「推」不下來的！是不是？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「物必自腐，而後蟲蛀子！」他彷彿聽見紹文的聲音，在他耳朶邊響着：「因為你們唱戲的人，往往要和好人家的婦女亂混，所以才有人會把你們同樣的當做玩物看！只要你自己守得淸白，別說一個鎭守使，就是大總統，大元師，也不敢小看你！」</p>
<p>因此，秋海棠一到台上，總是專心致意的唱戲，儘管心裏很明白，有許多美麗的女人正在發出電氣一樣的眼光來挑逗着他，他也不敢向她們回看一看。</p>
<p>但王家的媳婦兒倒眞是許多女人中很特別的一個，她不但捨得時間，而且還拼得花錢。在廣德樓時，就有一個看座兒的受了她的厚賂，送過幾套行頭到後台來：雖然秋海棠沒有接受，可是至少有幾百塊錢她已經化掉了！其後秋海棠家裏，又曾不斷的收到一個不具名姓的人所送的許多厚禮，顯然也是這個女人的苦心。無奈秋海棠的意志，還並不像一般年輕人那樣的易於顚倒，同時又有袁紹文以良友的資格，不時在帝督責，所以始終不曾做出事來。</p>
<p>大槪好後來才發現惟有榮奎是秋海棠身邊最密切的人，要達到她的目的，只有這個人是一條好幫手，因此她就打發她所最寵信的老媽子來代表她向榮奎受了袁紹文的一塲訓斥，走回第一樓的時候，又在後台門外撞見了這個年紀比「眞紅娘」老了三四倍的「假紅娘」，而且不等他開口，已照例先遞過了一個紅紙包來，圓圓的，硬硬的，觸在榮奎手裏　，立刻就使他知道又是十塊大洋進門了。</p>
<p>錢本來就是世界上最可貴的法寳，他可叫人死，可以叫人生，又何况這一些小差使？而全榮奎的良心也眞不壞，，他覺得拿了人家的錢，也應該給人家做些事，反正王家的媳婦兒又不是什麽毒蛇猛獸，秋海棠和她見上一面，難道就會給她吞吃了不成？</p>
<p>「好的，你留下一個號碼，有機會我給你打電！」榮奎這麽一想，膽子就更壯起來了，倒像這是他份內應做的事。（一八）</p>

<h3>看完了辣斐的「家」</h3>
<p>— 式微</p>
<p>家，春，秋，這連續的三部曲，可以說是巴金創作的代表，當我看到了「家」以後，雖然我並不是在大家庭和封建制度下生長起來，可是我却曾爲那被新時代巨輪輾動下崩潰的事蹟，在忠實動人的描寫下，流着淚讀完。</p>
<p>那是無可諱言的，巴金他是個始終站在時代前哨的作家，他有廣大的羣衆，他的創作普遍的展開在每個不同的階級和角落。我們知道當他起始寫家的時候，四面楚歌下的覺新，在重重封建惡毒下是被迫死了，可是在寫「秋」的時候，廣州在炸彈威脅下防空壕中揮筆，大時代下的靑年，再也不該懦弱了，於是我們在「秋」可以看到：在遍生荊棘下的覺新，畢竟在强倔的活下去，他毀滅「家」底輪廓，改變所擬好的屈服，在時代的洪流下，那是渣滓。</p>
<p>正因爲家底背景是充滿了封建餘毒的大家庭，於是隱藏在裹面的情形，人底浮動，都十分複雜。當我聽到上海劇藝社有改編「家」爲劇本出演的時候，我眞感到無上的欣喜。可是我不禁又有些懷疑，如果要將這數十萬言人事沓雜的「家」，要在短短三小時中緊湊明朗的演完，我眞有些担憂，或將失去原來的菁華，然而出諸我意料之外的，在辣斐劇塲我看到在吳天動人的改編下的一家」後。我感到無上的滿意。</p>
<p>啟幕是高公館，年尾辭歲當　家團聚的時候，四代同堂的高老大爺，發現覺慧不在，雖然學校已放寒假，可是却仍然忙着開會辦週報，於是一班頑固衛道，流，尤其以爺爺的　友馮樂山爲中柱，和克明克安的一派，大爲歎息，那不是洋學堂，唸洋　的結與麼？雖然他們自己靡廢的私生活，都堪指摘。可是年靑的一代，尤其覺慧，他們受到近代文化的洗禮，他咒詛封建餘毒的大家庭他愛他底大哥覺新，可是進更恨他，他是太懦弱的無抵抗者，一切都忍受着。當他二兄弟有什麽行動囂張（？）的時候，爺爺是唯覺新是問。你我是靑年，我們要自己把幸福拖回來，一味的忍受，你害死了梅表妹，更害死了大嫂，還嫌不够麼？叫一哥來忍受，你還想把這慘劇在覺民身上再演一遍麼？於是一我們自身的問題，要給我們自己去解決下」，覺民開始去逃婚，「你是惡　力的憑附者。」覺慧他再也不能在這惡濁隱影下的大家庭下，更逗留一分鐘，爲了自己憧憬的前途，毅然拋棄親愛的弟兄，雖然他們每個是深深的愛着，然而他們底思想，却構成劃時代的巨溝，覺慧終於出走了</p>
<p>故事是爲我們所熟知的，劇本是忠實於原著的，導演的手法也十分湊密和細膩，尤其是人物的刻劃，像克定在爺爺面前的不打自招，吸鴉片，負債款，那一付油腔的吸鼻烟；高老大爺問馮樂山所放的燄火如何，他却目不轉睛的瞪住了頭嗚鳳，說出雙關語，那是十分聰穎。</p>
<p>演員以徐立的覺新最為生色，他一方面受到封建餘毒的高壓，一方面新生的力量却直接向他抗對，他充滿痛苦的矛盾。英子飾鳴鳳的孤苦零仃，藍蘭飾梅表妹的悽惻動人，兩個不幸的人却分別演出絕對逈異的效果。嚴俊是以詼諧的姿勢出塲，他那付丑角的特寫，在悽慘的氣氛中，恰恰做到調節的程度。其他夏霞，韓非，胡導，戴耘都很稱職。置景也使人愜意，</p>
<p>也許我是富情感的，在我看完了「家」，我曾流出我那廉價的眼淚，在歸途上我冉三泛起覺新所說的一句話：「我們是靑年，我們不能永遠的做奴　，我們要把自己的幸福追回來。」</p>

<p>— 夏莎</p>
<p>「白雪公主」和「木偶奇遇記」的創造者最近父有一部音樂卡通集了，其中包括八個短片，全部以古典音樂配合，片的總名叫做「幻想曲」。而且，卡通中的主角都是新的典型，只有一部短片是用米老鼠的</p>
<p>「幻想曲」已自一月中句起在紐的百老滙戲院作「世界獻映」因爲　以卡通集是具有敎育意義而兼音樂化的，所以無論在那方面來講都能收到效果。來賓中有攝影記者，有音樂家，有五彩藝術工作人員，有技術專家，有電影明星，有舞台紅伶，有新聞記者，有者名劇評人，更有成千成萬的各界觀衆，其中最多是愛好音樂的人和天眞爛漫的兒童。</p>
<p>華德狄　耐因傾全力以赴，故該卡通集的配音，人物及色彩皆比其本人任何舊作爲進步。歟映日的座價收入的牛數是撥作爲英國戰事救濟金的。每一短片映完後，接着是繼續不斷的掌聲和喝彩。八部短片映足二小時三刻鍾，然而音樂的美妙，把他們吸引住，實在是空前絕後的。</p>
<p>最後應當提出的便是大音樂家史托高斯基，是嘉寳的愛人他就是華德狄斯耐本片的製譜揷曲家，他說要讓觀衆栩栩如生地親眼見到卡通的藝術畫面和欣賞它的動人悅耳的晋調，他說要給觀衆們好像在高山旁聽到泉流的水聲，聽到牧羊童的唱聲，聽到柔和的風聲，聽到鳥類的歌唱聲；而革德狄斯耐的這部「幻想曲」確實做到了這一點，是偉打的音樂化的卡通片。</p>

<h3>電影事業的發展</h3>
<p>一九四一年將在電影史上佔一重要地位，以較少的贏利也許足以造成更佳的結果，同時會紛影迷們以更美的趣味。</p>
<p>一九四一年銀幕上會有一批新的才能者，好多成名的影人退休，正是一般新人大顯其才智的日子。這一羣人慢慢地自會獲得擁戴。</p>
<p>影迷們的批評才能要比較聰明而銳利，他們首先要一個很好的故事，這個要求對於影片界效力很大。</p>

<h3>U.S. Reporter's Interview with Chairman Chiang: Establishing Lasting Peace in the Far East Requires Cooperation Between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. China Needs Greater Financial Aid from the U.S. Dr. Currie, Assistant to President Roosevelt, Departs for China</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Yesterday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in a solo interview with this reporter, stated that if the United States were to aid China with half the assistance it provides to Britain, the U.S. itself would not face the danger of being drawn into the Far Eastern war. Chairman Chiang firmly declared, "If China receives sufficient material aid, it can deal with Japan alone, without the need for external military assistance." Chairman Chiang further stated that in the war against Japan, China needs greater financial aid from the United States and the supply of military equipment. Chairman Chiang said he is preparing to receive Dr. Currie, an assistant to President Roosevelt, who has been sent by the U.S. President to study certain economic issues. Answering a reporter's question, Chairman Chiang said that the Yunnan-Burma Road is not in danger of being blockaded by Japan. This road is the only remaining route for transporting goods from the United States into China. This reporter traveled to Kunming and Lashio last week, the former being the first station on the Yunnan-Burma Road in Yunnan, and the latter being the end point of the road in Burma. According to most travelers, drivers, boatmen, and merchants, although Japanese bombing has caused slight damage to bridges and slightly hindered freight transport, the damaged areas are quickly repaired, and the disruption to shipping is temporary. Chairman Chiang expressed interest in the latest news from Washington and expressed great satisfaction with the cancellation of the moral embargo against the Soviet Union. He said, "Lasting peace in the Far East must be built on the cooperation of the great powers bordering the Pacific: China, the Soviet Union, and the United States." (United Press, Far East Manager Morris, 30th)</p>
<p>San Francisco. Dr. Currie, an assistant to President Roosevelt, left here yesterday aboard a Clipper flying boat for Hong Kong. He is traveling to Chongqing on President Roosevelt's orders, which has aroused much speculation. However, the purpose of this trip has not been officially announced. But because Currie is a renowned economist and because the U.S. government has provided financial aid to China, observers believe that Dr. Currie's trip is to gather fresh economic data. He was born in Novia, and came to the US in 1925 and became a US citizen in 1934, in 1921.</p>
<p>Washington. General Chiang Kai-shek's solo meeting with Morris, the Far East Manager of the United Press, in Chongqing yesterday, emphasizing the importance of U.S. economic aid to China, has been received with sympathy by all sectors here today. They believe that the aforementioned statement proves the cooperative and friendly attitude of the highest Chinese authorities during Dr. Currie's trip to China, who is traveling to Chongqing on the President's orders to study economic issues. General Chiang told Mr. Morris yesterday that if the United States were to aid China with half the assistance it provides to Britain, China could fight Japan alone, and the U.S. would not face the danger of being drawn into the Far Eastern war. U.S. government officials pointed out that the purpose of U.S. economic aid to China, Britain, and Greece is very clear, and the government is continuing to sincerely study the method and extent of this aid. Officials further stated that General Chiang's decision to issue a statement is very timely, as it can draw public attention to China's urgent needs at a time when the public is gradually focusing on Britain. General Chiang's statement that lasting peace in the East must be built on the cooperation of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union is clearly in line with the U.S. view of the Far East. Non-official sources here now say that Britain, fearing that the Soviet Union might aid Germany, requested strict control over exports to the Soviet Union, but the sudden cancellation of the moral embargo against the Soviet Union is truly perplexing. The amount of loans extended by the U.S. government to China at the beginning of this year totaled U.S.$240 million (six portions were handled by the Export-Import Bank). This figure does not include the U.S.$50 million for the Currency Stabilization Fund loan. The procedures and actual use of the Currency Stabilization Fund loan are still being finalized. The impression here is that when discussing the Lend-Lease Act, the United States will adhere to its traditional Far Eastern policy, upholding the Open Door policy, sovereignty, and the sanctity of treaties. Therefore, foreign affairs experts believe that the future of Sino-U.S. cooperation is very promising. (United Press Correspondent Franz, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Longzhou; French Consulate Bombed; Consul Magali Injured</h3>
<p>Hanoi. Reliable sources reported yesterday that Japanese planes bombed Longzhou, near the Vietnamese border, on Tuesday afternoon, damaging a French church and the French consulate, which was flying the French flag. Bombs dropped by Japanese planes injured the newly appointed French Consul, Mr. Gamali, and a French priest. Both have been taken across the river to a hospital in Lang Son, Vietnam. It is believed that the Japanese planes took off from a Vietnamese airfield. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Guilin. Four waves of Japanese planes successively invaded Longzhou today, dropping more than ten bombs, destroying several civilian houses and several civilian boats. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>35,000 Japanese Troops Concentrated in Xiamen</h3>
<p>Guilin. Military sources said today that 35,000 Japanese troops and 50 Japanese planes have concentrated in Xiamen. These troops are in addition to the ordinary garrison. However, the Chinese military is unaware of the purpose of the Japanese troop concentration in Xiamen. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, Chongqing-Guangyuan Section, to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Highway transportation between Chongqing and the Northwest is a vital route for connecting international lines and plays a crucial role during the war. In November of last year, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Communications inspected transportation in the Northwest and, recognizing the urgent need to strengthen the existing transportation capacity of the line, immediately established the Sichuan-Shaanxi Joint Transportation Office to organize direct traffic between Chongqing and Guangyuan. The office has now been established, with five stations set up along the line in Chongqing, Neijiang, Chengdu, Zitong, and Guangyuan. Starting from February 1st, a passenger bus will depart from the Chongqing and Guangyuan stations on alternate days, selling direct passenger tickets. Subsequently, efforts will be made to increase the number of buses as needed based on business requirements. It is reported that the Chongqing station will be located at Lianglukou, and passengers can register at the station in advance. (29th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ningxia Remits Funds to Aid Refugees in Southern Guangxi</h3>
<p>Guilin. The Ningxia Provincial Relief Association has remitted 30,000 yuan to Guilin to aid refugees in southern Guangxi. In addition, Dongsu, Tianyang, Guanyang, and other counties in southern Guangxi Province have also remitted relief funds to the province for the purpose of aiding refugees. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guizhou Savings Exceed Four Million</h3>
<p>Guiyang. As of now, the Guizhou Savings Promotion Committee has raised more than 3.9 million yuan. Combined with the savings from the Savings Committee over the years, the total reaches more than 4.425 million yuan. It is expected that the end of the year will reach 6 million yuan. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Prohibits Wine Brewing</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The National Grain Administration, considering that winemaking consumes a large amount of grain, has consulted with the Sichuan Provincial Government to issue an order to prohibit it. Except for alcohol related to military needs, which existing alcohol factories are still allowed to manufacture, all other types of wine are prohibited from being brewed. (30th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Dissolution of the New Fourth Army</h3>
<p>The Chinese Military Commission's decision to dissolve the New Fourth Army, compared to the issue of resistance and nation-building, which is tied to the survival and revival of the Chinese nation, or to the European war, which is tied to the long-term destiny of many nations, or to the issue of U.S. aid to China, Britain, and Greece, which is tied to the future safety of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, can truly be seen as a minor incident that is not worth mentioning and does not constitute a problem. However, various parties, both domestic and foreign, may not be able to objectively weigh the importance and distinguish between the major and minor aspects of this incident. It has become a popular topic in society, and people in other countries have also expressed their concern. It goes without saying that those who rejoice in others' misfortunes are exaggerating the situation. On the other hand, the Military Commission has repeatedly disclosed the circumstances surrounding this decision, which is very different from the previous casual treatment of the punishment of figures like Han Fuju and Shi Yousan. This is probably because it has seen the excessive attention paid to this incident by various parties. Because of the excessive attention paid by various parties, this reporter would also like to briefly express his views.</p>
<p>A month ago, this reporter published a commentary entitled "Rumors About the Chinese Communist Party," with the aim of urging the New Fourth Army to comply with the order to transfer its defense area. At that time, the Military Commission had already issued the order to transfer the defense area, but the New Fourth Army was engaging in evasive tactics and refusing to obey the order. Moreover, various signs indicated that dissolution was inevitable. The initial attempts by the central government to compromise and appease, and the final point at which it could no longer tolerate the situation, as well as the complex twists and turns involved, are detailed in the speech by the spokesman of the Military Commission reported in the newspaper in mid-last month, as well as in the full text of the joint telegram from Generals He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi to Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Ye Ting, and Xiang Ying before the decision was made to dissolve the New Fourth Army. There is no need for this reporter to elaborate further. Anyone who has read that speech and the joint telegram, after understanding the causes and consequences, will inevitably feel pain and sigh! It is because, within the camp of resistance and nation-building, there are still some officers and soldiers who are unable to recognize the threat and crisis posed to the nation by the invasion, and who do not devote their loyalty and energy to the combat mission they are responsible for. They are also unable to recognize that military orders and strategies are the longitude and latitude that must be respected in the entire war, and are also the foundation that must be maintained to win the final victory. Moreover, they still exhibit the various phenomena described in that speech and the joint telegram, which cannot but be considered beyond general imagination.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, both Chinese people and friends of China deeply sigh and feel pain. Not only sighing and feeling pain, but also hearing talks of worry and suspicion. Some believe that this is the beginning of a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In fact, this is a matter of military discipline and not a political issue. It is the dissolution of the New Fourth Army and not the punishment of the Communist Party. The fault lies with some officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army and not the complete rejection of all officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army. These differences must be clearly distinguished. After a clear distinction is made, no matter how this matter develops, it will not lead to the inevitable conclusion of a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Moreover, the beliefs and reputation that the Communist Party currently holds are mainly based on accepting the Three Principles of the People and supporting the national policy of resistance and nation-building. If some members of the Communist Party resent the Kuomintang because they are dissatisfied with the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, then this matter is definitely not the beginning of a so-called split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but rather the beginning of a continued split within the Communist Party regarding the acceptance of the Three Principles of the People and the support of the national policy of resistance and nation-building, because their main components and foundations are based on this. Some believe that this is a measure that weakens the strength of the resistance and nation-building. In fact, while the strength of resistance and nation-building is valued for its depth, it is not valued for its complexity and impurity. The combination and application of strength must be unified and disciplined. Overlapping and deviating from discipline will not only fail to become a component of strength but will inevitably affect the function of other forces due to mutual cancellation. Therefore, elimination is a normal evolution and also a manifestation of strength. Its meaning is very different from "mutual destruction" and even the opposite of "weakening." Some believe that it will result in a situation where birds flock to the forest and fish fight in the deep, creating enemies for oneself. In fact, people with national consciousness, after being influenced by nationalism, prioritize the nation above all else and will never waver. However, wavering elements are always unreliable and dangerous elements. We have no way of knowing what basic concepts the New Fourth Army usually used to train and restrain its troops, but the struggle that China is engaged in today is neither a political struggle nor a class struggle, but a national struggle. Therefore, how can the dissolution of the New Fourth Army shake the national beliefs of the people in the military? In short, these worries and suspicions stem from a deep love for China, but also from a lack of understanding of reality. Although we cannot recognize the New Fourth Army as a force when it exists, the evaluation of strength must be based on the premise of obedience to discipline and the actual contribution to resistance and nation-building. If the premise is not established, then the contribution equals zero, and the evaluation equals zero.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debate on Trade in China; Undersecretary Butler Says Impacted by Japanese Restrictions</h3>
<p>London. Yesterday in the House of Commons, a member asked whether the situation in the British concession in Tianjin was satisfactory and whether British nationals could freely travel between the concession and the occupied areas. Undersecretary Butler replied, "Yes." Conservative member Milner asked whether British ships were permitted to sail up the Pearl River to Guangzhou. Butler replied that British ships sailed to Guangzhou once a week and that difficulties had arisen regarding quarantine regulations and pilotage fees, but that discussions were underway. Conservative member Graham asked what restrictions the Japanese had imposed on imports and exports in the occupied areas of China, and to what extent these restrictions affected British trade. Butler then outlined the restrictions in North China, Central China, and South China, saying that British and other foreign merchants were greatly affected by these restrictions. Conservative member Mogen asked whether there were any improvements to report regarding the facilities available to British shipping in Chinese coastal ports such as Qingdao and Yantai. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Eden was currently collecting reports on the latest situation, as it affected the facilities available to British shipping in North China. The Foreign Secretary has also requested that a report be prepared on the inland waterways of China, excluding the Yangtze River, for use by human shipping. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3>Resignation of Directors of the Kulangsu Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to Xiamen news received by the Japanese side, the Chairman of the Kulangsu Municipal Council, Mr. Bushcock, and one other director, suddenly resigned on January 23, leaving only one Japanese director on the Council. As a result, municipal affairs have again come to a standstill. The Council was originally scheduled to meet on January 24 to discuss the four points of negotiation proposed by the Japanese Consul General on January 21 regarding the shooting of Mr. Huang Longgang (transliteration), the Taiwanese chief of the Xiamen District Court, on January 17. However, due to the insufficient number of directors, the Council could not legally convene. As a result, the affairs of the Council were taken over by the consular body headed by the British Consul General, as had happened in 1926 when the Council was unable to form a board of directors.

<h3>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Revises and Passes Lend-Lease Bill; Senate Also Approves Appropriation of 900 Million Dollars to Build 400 Small Warships; U.S.-British Base Lease Negotiations Held in London</h3>
<p>Washington. The U.S. government achieved its first decisive victory on the aid to democracies bill yesterday, as the House Foreign Affairs Committee (1) limited the effective date of the bill prohibiting U.S. warships from transporting military supplies to June 30, 1943; (2) stipulated that the President report to Congress every 90 days on the implementation of the bill; and (3) stipulated that the President consult with officials from the Navy and Army departments before transporting military supplies to foreign countries.

<p>Washington. Secretary of War Colonel Stimson testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that if Britain can overcome the crisis this spring, the possibility of Britain's final victory is "extremely great." Colonel Stimson said that the Aid to Democracies Act will give the United States the opportunity to "buy time" and expand its military from the only country that can sell time, which is Great Britain. Colonel Stimson said that the difficulties encountered by Germany have caused repercussions in Italy, Romania, and Norway. He declared that Japan's economic situation has been stagnant for a long time and that Italy is also in a "critical situation." He said that British morale has not been affected. Stimson also said that the victory of democracy depends on sea and air control. He said that limiting President Roosevelt's powers, revising the bill, and prohibiting U.S. transport ships from going to Europe, etc., "would be extremely unfortunate." (United Press, 30th)</p>

The British government is using most of its gold reserves and gradually selling the U.S. securities held by its citizens. However, there is a more difficult problem in the investment business, such as the shares of U.S. businesses managed by British companies in Britain are not being auctioned on the stock exchange. The British government has decided to make use of this investment, so it has invited Sir Peacock, who has considerable experience in this matter, to go to the United States to conduct on-site research into the possibility of utilizing this investment. Mr. Peacock will arrive in the United States soon. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Answers Assembly Questions, Expresses Determination to Advance Southward, Japanese-Soviet Relations Difficult to Improve in Short Term, American Officer Believes Japan Will Invade the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, in answering questions from the House Budget Committee, stated that the Dutch East Indies is eager to establish an economic agreement with Japan in order to "avoid unfortunate incidents." Assemblyman Imai believes that the United States may use force to interfere with Japan's southward advance. He asked Mr. Yosuke Matsuoka what degree of confidence he has regarding Japan's peaceful negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. The Foreign Minister, in answering the Assemblyman's questions, admitted that the problem will be addressed with utmost effort, because "the Dutch East Indies seems to hope to establish this agreement to avoid things from becoming extremely deteriorated." Regarding the question of whether the United States might intervene, the Foreign Minister stated that Japan should show the United States "a strong determination." Yosuke Matsuoka then answered Mr. Kawanishi's question, saying, "Up until now, my tone regarding future U.S.-Japan relations has been based on past facts. My tone may be too pessimistic, but in the dictionary of diplomats, there is no such word as 'despair.'" He also said that Japan has sent General Nomura as an envoy to the United States to solemnly inform President Roosevelt and the American people of "the disasters that humanity will suffer" if the United States joins the war. The Foreign Minister, in answering another question from Kawanishi regarding the Soviet Union, admitted that it is not easy to improve relations with the Soviet Union "overnight." He continued that he is willing to continue negotiations, "not hoping to achieve it at one stroke."

In the past twenty-four hours, Italian troops continued to launch desperate counterattacks, resulting in defeat and retreat. The new Italian Commander-in-Chief, General Gavarillo, is making his greatest efforts in the central sector of the front, so the fighting in the central sector is particularly fierce. Two Italian regiments have lost contact with their base and have been scattered by Greek artillery fire. Another two Italian units are also isolated and hiding in the woods. Greek troops made significant progress in defeating Italian operations in the central and northern sectors yesterday. The Italian troops are retreating in disarray. Since General Gavarillo launched his offensive, each Italian counterattack has incurred heavy costs in terms of manpower and material resources. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. According to the latest news received in London, the Albanian front is now limited to a fierce battle in one corner, and Greek troops are clearly able to continue to make gains. Greek troops in the south have captured several high grounds and villages and are reportedly advancing towards Vlora. Although the newly appointed Italian commander is making every effort to supervise the battle and using more tanks and airplanes in counterattacks than before, according to Greek sources, the Italian counterattacks are only causing more bloodshed for the Italian troops. The Greek side claims to have captured many more enemies and shot down two Italian aircraft. The military hospital in Salonica was bombed by Italian aircraft, causing some casualties. Villages in Macedonia were also attacked. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

The Italian troops surrounded in that area are remnants of two divisions of Italian troops retreating from Sidi Barrani. They are carrying several tanks and armored vehicles. The British army is using Tobruk as a forward base, which greatly facilitates the British advance, as the Italian troops abandoned a large amount of water and gasoline in Tobruk without destroying it. British responsible sources are very concerned about the fate of the 200,000 Italians residing in Abyssinia, as they are threatened by the growing Abyssinian patriotic movement. It is reported that many Italians are now concentrated in the Abyssinian capital and other places, as safety is only achieved when there are many people. However, the food problem will inevitably arise sooner or later. Even if some food is transported from Djibouti, it will be of no avail. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

On January 24, two divisions of Japanese troops moved out from three bases north of Xin in five routes, advancing north. They encountered strong resistance two days later and are still continuing. When asked if the Japanese action was a harbinger of a spring offensive, the spokesman replied that this was probably not the case, because the strength of the Japanese troops was not sufficient to guarantee this belief. However, the spokesman acknowledged that the area was indeed the true intent of the Japanese, and the fighting further east was merely a diversion, hoping to hinder the movement of reinforcements. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. At a press conference this afternoon, a military spokesman spoke of the southern Henan battle as one of the important battles, and the Japanese aim was clear that they attempted to open up the Pinghan Railway Line. How much the two divisions that are now used on the front can achieve depends on what happens in the next week. The Japanese launched an offensive at Jingdang and east of the Xiang River on the 12th to hold Chinese forces, but used not many troops and were driven back by the Chinese forces. The Japanese main force was at Xinyang, and on the 24th, they marched north in three routes from Changtaiguan, Chushandian, and Youhe.

<h3>On the Enlarged Memorial Week Meeting of the National Government, Chairman Chiang's Admonition: Explanation of the Dissolution of the New Fourth Army</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Yesterday's Dispatch) I believe that not a single descendant of the Yellow Emperor would willingly act as an accomplice to the Japanese. Therefore, if today there are still those who endlessly spread rumors and exaggerate the already resolved issue of the New Fourth Army, they are merely acting as echoes for the rumor-mongers. My patriotic compatriots, both military and civilian, will certainly not be deceived by them and will undoubtedly reject them outright. Everyone must understand why we did not announce the illegal and undisciplined behavior of the New Fourth Army in the past. It is because the New Fourth Army was a part of the National Revolutionary Army, and I am the commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army. I often say that our revolutionary army is one big family. Therefore, I usually treat my subordinates as a parent treats his children. If the children are good, it is naturally the parent's honor; if the children are bad, it is also the parent's shame. Therefore, although the New Fourth Army has committed various crimes in the past, I always considered it my responsibility as commander-in-chief. To fulfill my responsibility and to protect my subordinates, I have only continuously warned and constantly supervised them, always hoping that they</p>
<p>would awaken and reform themselves, embark on the road to revolutionary success, and truly strive for the nation and the country. I was unwilling to expose their crimes, thereby cutting off their path to self-renewal and causing them to be spurned by the people of the whole country, both military and civilian. This is what I could not bear to do. However, my painstaking efforts did not move them. Instead, they thought that the central government was weak and incompetent, and even that I was afraid of them. They even threatened to influence international opinion and cause internal division and civil war, and did not hesitate to let the Japanese know our internal weaknesses, using this means to threaten us. I ask you, can the actions of a subordinate, being presumptuous, reckless, and utterly absurd, and whose malicious intentions even go so far as to use the exposure of the army's weaknesses to the enemy as a tool to intimidate superiors, such acts of regression and defiance, still be tolerated? In fact, the New Fourth Army's various illegal and undisciplined actions against the central government, both north and south of the Yangtze River, have long been known to the Japanese army, and they know them even more clearly than we do. Therefore, we are definitely not afraid of the Japanese or the international community knowing about their crimes that we did not announce them. There is also an important reason why I have always endured and kept silent, and that is that Chinese society, whether towards friends or subordinates, has always held a most important principle of morality, which is</p>
<p>to conceal evil and promote good. I have always treated people with this principle, especially my own subordinates. In terms of public duty, we are comrades-in-arms; in terms of private friendship, we are like family. The honor and disgrace of my subordinates are the honor and disgrace of my superiors; the merits and demerits of my subordinates are the merits and demerits of my superiors. Therefore, their faults can only be borne by myself. I will never announce them unless absolutely necessary. But they violated the law, disobeyed orders, and sabotaged operations to such an extent that I could no longer tolerate and condone them. If I did not take decisive measures, it would shake the national policy and endanger the country's survival. Everyone who has read the New Testament knows that the teachings of Christ exhort people to forgive sinners seventy times seven times. But the sins of the New Fourth Army have long exceeded seventy times seven times. Even if we have the utmost tolerance, we can no longer tolerate and forgive an army that is so incorrigible and obstinate. Otherwise, we would be committing a crime ourselves and harming the country, making me a sinner for all time. Everyone must also know that military discipline is a covenant that is recognized and observed by the entire army, from top to bottom, without distinction of rank, without special exceptions, and without deviation in treatment.</p>
<p>From the commander-in-chief to the soldiers, all are equal before military discipline. If someone violates military orders and undermines military discipline, and the commander-in-chief is negligent, or even condones evil, and fails to punish according to the law, then the commander-in-chief cannot escape his responsibility, and the entire army will be unable to fight. Therefore, in order to achieve victory and to safeguard the survival of the country, we must respect military orders and rectify military discipline, so that the entire army, from top to bottom, will clearly understand the strictness of military discipline. Under the strict military discipline, everyone should work together in the sacred war to accomplish our mission of saving the country and reviving the nation. Everyone knows why Japan is mired in the mud today and cannot extricate itself. It is because their government does not have the ability to maintain national law and enforce discipline, which has led to the entire nation being in its current situation. The September 18th Incident occurred because a group of young and radical officers acted freely and did not obey government orders, and their government did not have the ability to stop them. Therefore, there continued to be the so-called "May 15th Incident," which evolved into the crime of active-duty soldiers brutally murdering their prime minister. There was also the so-called "February 26th Incident," in which they murdered veteran statesmen and important cabinet members in their capital, and even occupied the parliament and destroyed the government. In the end, it led to the July 7th Incident, which triggered a war in East Asia unprecedented in history, destroying civilization. This is all because the Japanese army corrupted military discipline and the Japanese government failed to rectify discipline. However, the reason why the Japanese army can still temporarily maintain the status quo and continue to fight in our country today is that their military still maintains</p>
<p>the habit of obeying orders. Even if Japanese officers and soldiers are tired of war and oppose it, and do not want to fight this aggressive and futile war, they still reluctantly obey the order to fight. We can say that Japan's discipline has been completely destroyed, but the frontline troops are still barely maintaining combat discipline. This shows that in a life-or-death battle, everything depends on effective command and the thorough implementation of orders. The Japanese army's aggressive war is unjustifiable, yet their officers and soldiers dare not disobey orders. How much more should our war of resistance, which is entirely for resisting Japanese aggression and safeguarding the survival of the nation, cause our people, both military and civilian, to automatically awaken, spare no effort, carry out orders thoroughly, and accomplish tasks to maintain the dignity of national discipline and military discipline. Only then can we guarantee the victory of our war of resistance and achieve the independence, freedom, and equality of our country and nation. As long as all our troops strictly observe discipline, obey orders, and follow the plans and assigned tasks stipulated by the General Headquarters, and earnestly carry them out, our government will definitely treat them equally, support and cherish them, so that they can contribute to the course of the war of resistance and achieve glorious success. Now that the designation of the New Fourth Army has been cancelled, this issue is naturally completely resolved, and there are no other issues. Our government has always been generous and caring, and has always taken care to protect all troops. As for myself, in the position of commander-in-chief of the country, it is as if I see my own children being subjected to such dishonorable punishment.</p>
<p>I only feel grief and shame. I hope that the entire army, from top to bottom, will regard this incident as the greatest humiliation in our national revolution and as the most heartbreaking page in our history of resisting Japanese aggression and national reconstruction. We must take the New Fourth Army as a warning, and from now on obey orders, observe discipline, not invade the defense areas of friendly forces, not hinder the tasks of friendly forces, not entice the soldiers of friendly forces, not rob the weapons and ammunition of friendly forces, not collect civilian guns, not confiscate civilian food, not disturb the local area, and not harm the people. Furthermore, all troops across the country should be able to protect the people, stabilize society, and especially cherish the people in the occupied areas, so that our people, both military and civilian, will be united in love and spirit. Then, the grief left to us by this New Fourth Army incident will inspire the confidence of the entire army in resisting Japanese aggression and national reconstruction, and we will be able to turn misfortune into blessing and create the achievements of all the officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army. In short, the handling of this New Fourth Army incident is entirely proactive, not passive. The main significance is to strengthen the war of resistance.</p>
<p>To summarize the key points, they are: (1) To thwart the Japanese ambition to weaken our war of resistance by alleging that our military discipline is corrupt and that we are internally divided. (2) To declare the discipline of the army, so that the entire army can have something to observe and admire, and be inspired to love themselves and serve the country, thereby strengthening our spirit of unity and resistance. Regarding the first point, if the Japanese know that our country has troops that act freely, hinder the war of resistance, and harm friendly forces, and that they are not subject to restraint, then their contempt for our country and our military will be even greater, and their aggressive ambitions will certainly become even more intense. Now that we have resolutely enforced discipline, punished them, and resolved the issue according to law, the Japanese have no reason to rejoice in our misfortune. Regarding the second point, if all our troops know that the government's previous endurance and silence were for the sake of the war of resistance, and that today's enforcement of the law is also for the sake of the war of resistance, and everyone takes this incident as a warning, then there will be no more actions that violate orders and undermine discipline. From now on, the entire army will unanimously uphold military discipline, obey military orders, and devote themselves to the war of resistance with one mind. There will be no more delays in executing orders, no more attacks on friendly forces, no more encroachment on defense areas, no more disrupting local areas, and no more harming the people. That is to say, the national spirit will embark on a path of progress, unity will be strengthened, and the strength of the war of resistance will also be strengthened. It must be understood that the thorough implementation of orders and the enforcement of military discipline are the guarantees</p>
<p>The most important key to the victory of the war of resistance is also the concern for the survival of the country. Whether the government has the ability to resist Japan and whether it is revolutionary depends on whether it can enforce discipline. Whether the army has the sincerity to defend the country and resist Japan also depends on whether it can abide by discipline and accept discipline. Only an army that strictly observes discipline and obeys orders is the true force of resistance and will be loved by the government and the people. Conversely, if they do not listen to orders, disregard discipline, abandon combat missions, or even attack friendly forces and reduce the strength of resistance, if such troops are allowed to exist, the country will inevitably perish, and not only will the war of resistance not succeed. Finally, I want to remind everyone that the government's decision to punish the New Fourth Army is entirely for the purpose of rectifying military discipline and does not involve other issues. This decision to handle the New Fourth Army is purely to punish troops that disobey orders and endanger the war of resistance. It has nothing to do with other troops that obey orders and work hard to resist Japan, and it has no political nature whatsoever. During the war of resistance, the government absolutely respects the due freedom and independent personality of all individuals, groups, and parties that abide by the program of resistance and provides them with</p>
<p>legal protection. As long as it is not the use of armed forces to resist government laws and decrees, even if there are legal issues involved, the government will handle them according to normal legal procedures. I often tell my friends that although our war of resistance is nearing victory, we cannot yet say that we have escaped the period of danger. At this important juncture of life and death, success or failure, the entire country, from top to bottom, must be especially careful and cautious. We must not be negligent or careless in anything, otherwise, our great cause of resistance will be ruined. However, the government must not be negligent and opportunistic in everything because of caution, and even fail to pursue responsibility or enforce discipline. In this way, the country and the revolution will never succeed. The reason why the government painfully punished the New Fourth Army is precisely because of this, and its significance lies in this. I hope that the entire country, both military and civilian, will be of one mind, strictly observe discipline, obey orders, and work together to fulfill our responsibilities and accomplish our mission of national revolution, and achieve our goal of saving the country and reviving the nation. As long as we all focus our efforts and actively undertake the great task of resisting Japanese aggression and national reconstruction, I believe that the bright future of our resistance is just around the corner.

<h3>Amidst the Peace Negotiations Between Thailand and Vietnam, Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Enter Vietnam; the Second Japanese Mechanized Division Arrives in Vietnam; the Second Fleet Sails South from Saigon</h3>
<p>Chongqing The Ta Kung Pao reported this morning that after the entire Third Japanese Mechanized Division arrived on Hainan Island, it has departed for Vietnam. The Japanese Second Fleet has sailed south from Saigon. Yesterday, Japanese planes heavily bombed Kunming, with a total of twenty-seven planes bombing twice, focusing on densely populated areas. Several bombs landed near the Southwest Associated University, and the gate of the Chaobao Newspaper was damaged by bullets. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo The peace negotiations between the representatives of Vietnam and Thailand, held on the Japanese cruiser "Natori," concluded last night and will resume today. After Japanese Major General Tsuta delivered a speech at the negotiating table, the two sides began exchanging views. The content of the first day's negotiations is unknown. (Haitong Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Bangkok According to the commander-in-chief of the Thai army, fighting has ceased, except for a few minor clashes. A statement from the General Headquarters recounted the border fighting of the past two months, stating that the Thai army had occupied two corners of the right bank of the Mekong River. If the French had agreed to cede these territories earlier, the fighting of the past two months could have been avoided. The outbreak of hostilities was actually caused by the French bombing of Nakhon Phanom on November 27th of last year. In addition to occupying the two territories, the Thai army also penetrated twenty-five miles into Cambodia from Surin to Siem Reap. Since the start of the fighting, the Thai army has only suffered one hundred deaths and three hundred injuries, which is insignificant compared to the total number of French casualties. However, the French side has not yet announced its casualties. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Bangkok According to sources here, the Thai representatives attending the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire conference in Tokyo are scheduled to fly there from here on February 2nd.

<h3>Hitler and Pétain to Hold Another Meeting; Germany Said to Have Made New Demands on France Related to the Future of the French Fleet</h3>
<p>London Yesterday, Ankara Radio reported that there are some rumors that Hitler will soon hold another meeting with Marshal Pétain. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London Darlan, the Vichy Navy Chief, went to Paris last Christmas, carrying a letter from Marshal Pétain to Hitler, which reportedly concerned the conditions for Franco-German cooperation. Now, Belyrand, the Vichy government's representative in Paris, has returned to Paris from Germany, carrying Hitler's reply. The contents are unknown. It is expected that Belyrand will go to Vichy in a few days. Previously, there were unconfirmed rumors that Hitler had made far-reaching demands related to the future of the French fleet. Recently, there have been rumors that Hitler has asked Pétain to allow Germany to use the Tunis base to threaten Britain's dominance in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Again Attack England; British Aircraft Also Bomb Germany</h3>
<p>London After ten nights of tranquility, London was attacked again before midnight last night. It was reported that high-explosive bombs fell in a few areas, and incendiary bombs fell in two other areas. When the first incendiary bomb fell, the air raid wardens sounded the whistle to call on the public to help. Hundreds of civilians emerged from their homes to work, extinguishing all the incendiary bombs within ten minutes. Yesterday, a large number of German planes approached London, but most were driven back or dispersed by anti-aircraft fire. Only a few slipped into central London. Although German aircraft were very active yesterday, their attacks were not as fierce as in previous air raids. Several attacks lasted a long time, taking up most of the night, but Londoners have become accustomed to this. It is generally believed that the losses and casualties last night were minor. It was also reported that some provinces were also attacked yesterday, but they were not severe. Two bombs fell on a town on the southeast coast, destroying several houses and causing some casualties. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>London Last night and this morning, due to improved weather conditions on the continent, the British Air Force and German aircraft resumed their large-scale operations. The British Air Force took off and attacked northern Germany. After a ten-day lull, German aircraft resumed their attacks on the central capital yesterday. According to a statement from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security, enemy aircraft carried out small-scale activities in England for several hours after dusk last night. Their attacks were mainly concentrated on London and its surrounding areas. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Broadcast Speech on the Eighth Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule</h3>
<p>Berlin Today is the eighth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. German Führer Hitler will deliver a radio address to the German people at 5:30 PM today and a second broadcast at 8:20 PM. (Haitong Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin In celebration of the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the Nazi regime, Hitler broadcast to the nation, stating that anyone who wants to aid Britain must know that every ship that approaches our torpedo tubes will be sunk. If the United States attempts to intervene in the European war, our objectives will immediately change. Britain's claim to world hegemony has failed due to the rise of the German-Italian alliance in Europe. It is futile to speculate on any differences between Germany and Italy, or that Italy will no longer be able to fight. It is equally futile to fabricate claims that a revolution will occur in Italy. If Britain believes that Italy's occasional failures are evidence of its victory, then I cannot understand it. He ended by saying that since the New Year, our military preparations have been more complete than ever before in Germany. This spring, we will begin a submarine offensive, at which time the enemy will know that we have not been idle. We are confident that we will achieve victory. After Hitler's speech, Propaganda Minister Goebbels shouted, "Under the leadership of the Führer, we obey and follow!" (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>International Anecdotes (1)</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>Former Publisher of the Japan Gazette, Mr. Hugh Byas, has returned to the United States. This newspaper has already translated and published one of his "Uncensored Reports," titled "The Current Stage of Deteriorating US-Japan Relations." We now translate and record another, titled "Recent Developments in Japanese Politics," as follows:</p>
<p>Japan is currently facing serious disputes over both domestic and foreign policy issues. Domestically, the government, in its pursuit of a totalitarian policy, has established the so-called New Order. However, extreme factions still hold widely divergent views on how to implement this New Order. In terms of foreign policy, one faction supports the government's friendly approach to the Soviet Union, while another faction completely distrusts the Soviets.</p>
<p>On July 5th of last year, a political conspiracy occurred in Japan. At that time, a group of radical elements calling themselves "Divine Soldiers" attempted to assassinate former Prime Minister Admiral Minei and Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira. On the same day, Japanese police arrested twenty-eight "Divine Soldiers," but Army Artillery Colonel Hashimoto, the suspected mastermind, remained at large and has since been appointed as a director in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the guiding organization of the New Order.</p>
<p>Hashimoto served as the commander of Japanese artillery along the Yangtze River in December 1937. The incident involving the American gunboat "Panay" and the British warship "Ladybird" was instigated by him. He is the leader of the ultranationalist Japanese Youth Party, which has five million members, giving him the power to influence the New Order movement.</p>
<p>Other signs of instability are everywhere. However, this does not mean that the era of military supremacy is about to end; it is merely a case of infighting among extremist elements. Japanese liberals have all retreated, and liberalism is now regarded as "treasonous" under totalitarian rule.</p>
<p>The extent of the power of Japanese extremist elements can be seen from the shocking actions of seventeen "Divine Soldiers." These "Divine Soldiers" are being tried by the Tokyo High Court for their conspiracy to assassinate the late Admiral Saito and many senior government officials in 1936. Last month, when the court summoned the defendants and Chief Prosecutor Mitsuhashi read out the indictment, the defendants, claiming that Mitsuhashi did not understand the New Order, refused to listen to the indictment and walked out of the courtroom. At that time, Chief Prosecutor Mitsuhashi requested the judge to take necessary steps to maintain order in the court, rectify the national discipline, and prevent the judicial system from being severely affected. However, after some deliberation, the judge ordered the prosecutor to proceed with reading the indictment regardless of whether the defendants were present.</p>
<p>A week later, many assassins, including those who assassinated former Prime Minister Hamaguchi, former Finance Minister Inoue, and former Mitsui Company President Takuma Dan, were granted amnesty on the occasion of the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan and regained their freedom. All of this proves the growing power of the extremist faction.</p>
<p>The current Prime Minister Konoe successfully formed a cabinet last July, but it was preceded by a bloodless revolution. It was generally believed that since he had taken office for the second time, he would become a dictatorial prime minister or would remain in office for ten years, unlike the recent frequent changes. However, the current situation makes it difficult for Konoe to stay in his position for long. The infighting among extremist elements puts him in a dilemma. There are even rumors that the "Divine Soldiers" would attempt to snipe at Konoe, and that a bullet grazed his arm, but this could not be verified.</p>
<p>Japanese extremist elements are divided into two factions: one faction advocates that Konoe should become a national leader under the protection of the Emperor; the other faction hopes that Konoe or someone else can take complete control of power, similar to European dictators.</p>
<p>The majority of them advocate loyalty to the Emperor. They believe that the fundamental difference between European totalitarianism and Japanese totalitarianism lies in the fact that the position of the Japanese Emperor is supreme and must remain so forever. Konoe and others may become national leaders or heads of government, but they must not infringe on imperial power. Konoe himself also holds this view and seems to have no ambition to emulate Hitler or Mussolini. However, there are also those who hope that Konoe will thoroughly implement dictatorship and restore the state of the Tokugawa shogunate.</p>
<p>The New Order movement was vigorously promoted last September and seemed to have permeated every sector of national life, but in recent months it has declined due to resistance from the lower classes and difficulties in implementation. Japanese newspapers have recently emphasized that in order to revive the system, further efforts are needed.</p>
<p>Japan's foreign policy is also becoming increasingly chaotic. The Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy is not taken seriously. Japan's initial decision to join the pact was not based on any rational policy. The main reason was that some pro-German and Italian elements, such as former Ambassador to Italy Shiratori, promoted it behind the scenes.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, the Konoe Cabinet has now taken a further step to become friendly with the Soviet Union and plans to negotiate a non-aggression pact with it. The Soviet Union had originally proposed to conclude such a pact with Japan eight years ago, but it was ignored by Japan. It is somewhat strange that it is being brought up again now.</p>
<p>However, Japanese public opinion and the military, who oppose compromise with the Soviet Union, still hold an important position. Since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, the Japanese have always regarded the Soviet Union as a sworn enemy, and most people still distrust the Soviets. Soldiers who participated in the Russo-Japanese War find it even harder to forget the psychology of shared hatred. Among them, General Araki and others are still influential figures in this radical faction and have publicly opposed Konoe.</p>
<p>However, the issue of the Dutch East Indies is causing a major accident in the Pacific. The Japanese are divided into two factions on this issue: one faction advocates using diplomacy to obtain the best conditions for developing the economy of the region; the other faction advocates seizing the resources of the South Pacific regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>Because Japan cannot conquer China, it wants to find another way out to compensate for its losses. If Japan can obtain the resources of the Dutch East Indies, then regardless of the outcome of the war in China, it will be considered a successful undertaking.</p>
<p>The Konoe Cabinet originally did not intend to adopt a radical policy to seize the Dutch East Indies, but after Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi recently visited the region to negotiate with the Dutch authorities and returned empty-handed, Japan became impatient again and was eager to try.</p>
<p>In short, Japan now has only one consistent view: to end the war with China as quickly as possible. Japan's "New Order in East Asia" has now exceeded its limits and regards the war in China as a restraint on its other major developments.</p>

<h3>Special Taxpayers Meeting Actively Preparing; Japanese Side Declares Refusal to Attend; Has Absolutely No Impact on Quorum; Police Authorities Adopt Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>The Special Taxpayers' Meeting, which was formally announced by the Danish Consul-General in Shanghai and Chairman of the Consular Body, Mr. Hille, to be reconvened at 2:30 PM on February 5th at the Grandstand of the Racecourse, has been met with great concern from all parties regarding the circumstances and outcome of the meeting. However, according to Japanese newspapers yesterday morning, Japanese taxpayers will not participate in the February 5th reconvened meeting. However, the Municipal Council believes that Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi has already given assurances that the same incident will not occur again if the meeting is reconvened. Therefore, they are still preparing to reconvene on schedule, and the police authorities have adopted various strict precautionary measures to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Japanese Taxpayers Refuse to Attend</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the decision of Japanese taxpayers to refuse to participate in the February 5th meeting was made at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Residents' Road Association the day before. The reason is that Japanese Taxpayers' Association President Yugichi Hayashi has fully criticized the Municipal Council's financial policies and has clearly expressed the opposition of Japanese taxpayers to the original proposal to increase taxes by 40%. This decision was submitted to the Japanese Taxpayers' Association for discussion by the Road Associations yesterday. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Association held a special meeting at the Japanese General Assembly Hall at 1:00 PM yesterday, to discuss the decision not to participate in the Special Meeting and to elect a new chairman to replace former Chairman Yugichi Hayashi, who was arrested and detained by the Japanese Consular Police for shooting Municipal Council Chairman Cornell and thus, it is generally speculated that this decision will be passed by the Association. When the Special Meeting reconvenes on February 5th, there will be no one in the Japanese taxpayers' seats.</p>
<p>Meeting Can Reach Quorum</p>
<p>It is believed that the reason why Japanese taxpayers refuse to participate in the reconvened Special Meeting is to attempt to make the meeting lack a quorum and postpone it again. However, according to a Municipal Council official yesterday morning, the quorum for the Special Taxpayers' Meeting is one-third of the total number of eligible votes, and the number of Japanese votes (not the number of Japanese taxpayers) is estimated to be less than half of the total number (estimated at 28,000 votes). Therefore, unless a majority of non-Japanese taxpayers are absent, even if all Japanese taxpayers do not participate at the time, the meeting will still reach a quorum, and the resolutions passed will be completely valid. It is predicted that when the meeting is reconvened on February 5th, because the proposals that have already been discussed will not be repeated, only the voting on the amendments proposed by the Japanese on the tax increase case will begin. The program will be reduced by half, so the meeting is expected to end within an hour. It is believed that the proposal to increase the Municipal General Tax, Land Tax, and Additional Tax proposed by the Municipal Council Board of Directors will be passed at that time.</p>
<p>Temporary Borrowing to Meet Urgent Needs</p>
<p>As for the Municipal Council's tax revenue, because of the delay in the Special Taxpayers' Meeting's decision on the tax increase case, the total amount of spring rates, house rates, and land rates due at the beginning of this year, estimated at more than 15 million yuan, has not yet been collected. It was originally hoped that it would be collected immediately after the meeting passed it on the 23rd, but it was postponed due to an accident. Therefore, the Municipal Council's financial authorities may temporarily borrow money to meet the necessary expenses at the end of this month, such as staff salaries and debt interest. According to the tax increase case decided by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, it will be implemented from January this year until the annual meeting of taxpayers in April. The tax rate after that will be decided at the annual meeting. According to the report of Municipal Council Chairman Cornell at the Special Taxpayers' Meeting on the 23rd, if this additional tax is implemented after April, the budget for this year will still be in deficit because the Municipal Council's budget for this year has increased significantly due to increased staff allowances, and expenses have increased by 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Hayashi Yugichi Has Already Received Preliminary Trial</p>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News yesterday, the main suspect in the Racecourse case, Yugichi Hayashi, has been given a preliminary trial by the Japanese Consular Court in this port on charges of premeditated murder. He was escorted to the Consular Court on Monday. Consular officials searched for detailed evidence and formally filed charges. According to reliable sources, the day after the incident, Hayashi Yugichi will be sent to Nagasaki, Japan, for a full trial after a preliminary hearing by the Japanese Consular Court, and will be punished according to Japanese law. However, people are quite interested and suspicious about whether Hayashi Yugichi will be sent to Nagasaki and whether he will be punished after being sent to Nagasaki. According to the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao, after the Japanese Consular Court detained Hayashi Yugichi on charges of premeditated murder, Kato, the prosecutor of the Japanese Consular Court, and Japanese officials escorted Hayashi Yugichi to the scene of the incident at the Grandstand of the Racecourse at 2:30 PM on the 27th to conduct an on-site inspection. Hayashi Yugichi narrated the process of shooting Municipal Council Chairman Cornell and Japanese Director Okamoto at that time for forty minutes. According to Hayashi Yugichi's reply to the Dalu Xinbao reporter's question, "I was the one who shot. Now I am waiting for all the consequences." He had nothing to say.</p>
<p>New Ballots Reissued</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Secretariat has decided to reissue new ballots in the near future because most of the ballots issued to taxpayers for use in the Special Meeting have been lost. The ballots are finely printed with silk-colored card stock. Taxpayers can enter the venue with this ballot. Except for special circumstances, foreigners are generally prohibited from entering the venue. At that time, the police authorities will send Chinese, English, Japanese, and Indian police officers to check tickets at the entrance of the venue and will be on strict guard inside and outside the venue and around the podium to maintain security and ensure safety. In addition, the venue layout has been renovated after being damaged in the previous meeting due to the chaotic order. At that time, the clean seats on the Grandstand, the beautiful flower decorations around the podium, and the tall and complete reed shed will meet more than 4,000 foreign taxpayers and foreign directors of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Another Suggestion for Increasing Taxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Westerner sent a letter to the North China Daily News, suggesting taxing the stock exchange to strengthen the Municipal Council's finances. It stated: "When Chairman Cornell answered the proposal at the last Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting, he said that if there were any proposals on taxation methods, as long as the proposal was within its statutory capabilities, the Municipal Council would always be prepared to give it close and detailed consideration. I hereby request the Municipal Council to consider increasing the tax rate on any affairs related to the exchange by 1%. You can see from the table below that you can get a lot of money by using this method. (The following table shows the past transaction volume) January 3, 43,042,900 yuan, January 10, 52,928,700 yuan, January 17, 92,852,100 yuan, January 24, 69,034,300 yuan. In summary, 358,858,000 yuan. If a 1% tax is levied (a tax of 5 per mille is levied on sellers and buyers), the total amount is 2,588,580 yuan, then the total amount for one year will be 33,651,540 yuan. Subtracting the estimated lack of expenses will be 13,651,540 yuan. Then use the method of increasing the license fees for cars and dogs (both are luxury goods), or it may exceed 14 million yuan, which can be used to pay the Municipal Council's debts and reduce the Municipal Council's liabilities. If this method is implemented, it will definitely not cause difficulties in the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting. I believe that the proposal meeting will definitely be passed unanimously, and the unsightly actions in the last meeting can be avoided."</p>
<h3>Various Industries Resume Business Today; Huihua Banks Had Excellent Business Performance Last Year; The One with the Highest Profit Made About One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The member banks of the Banking Industry Association and the member banks of the Foreign Merchants' Banking Association have resumed business yesterday after the three-day Spring Festival holiday.

Although the Money Exchange Shops are scheduled to be listed today, they have actually resumed trading yesterday because the foreign exchange, gold, and foreign currency markets have already opened red. As for the newly established limited liability money shops, they will open successively.</p>
<p>Red Trading</p>
<p>In addition to gold, stocks, foreign exchange, and foreign currencies, which resumed trading with red trading yesterday, the commodity markets such as soybeans, grains, cotton cloth, yarn, sugar, medicinal materials, hardware, paper, etc. will resume tea market today and open red trading.

<p>Opening Interbank Lending Rate</p>
<p>According to the interbank lending rate market in the city, the Ningbo Road Money Industry Market, has issued a public notice in the market yesterday, allowing interbank lending rates to be opened as usual at 8:45 am on January 31. However, during the Spring Festival period, only the morning market will be open, and the afternoon market will be temporarily suspended.

<p>Last Year's Business</p>
<p>In the 29th year of the Republic of China, the money industry and the Huihua banks, because they strictly abide by laws and regulations and only deposit and lend interest and calculate it on a daily basis, their profits are more than in previous years. It is heard that a certain bank made a profit of 1.02 million yuan, ranking first in the money industry. However, various money exchange shops buy and sell foreign currencies, operate foreign exchange, gold, securities, and engage in speculative transactions, so their profits are quite high. It is heard that many have made millions of profits, especially the shops that speculate in gold. In terms of various industries, the ones with the highest profits are hardware, cotton yarn, cloth, groceries, etc.</p>
<h3>Cornell Attended the Bureau Yesterday with Illness</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Chairman Cornell was injured in the last Foreign Taxpayers' Congress. Fortunately, the injury was minor. He was only hospitalized for three days and returned to his private residence to recuperate. Yesterday noon, the Chairman went to the Bureau with his injury to work.

<h3>American Relief Wheat</h3>
<p>The American cargo ship Collinsworth, with a deadweight of 3,127 tons, has been ordered by the American Red Cross to load 40,000 bags of crushed wheat again, weighing 1,000 tons, from Seattle via San Francisco, Hawaii, Guam, and Kobe, Japan, to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to arrive in port this afternoon and berth at floating docks 12 and 13. All the American wheat will be shipped back to the country as soon as it is unloaded.

<h3>Telegraphs Increase in Price Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the General Directorate of Telegraphs of the Ministry of Communications announced that it would increase domestic and foreign telegraph fees due to rising material prices and cost of living, the four telegraph companies in this port, Dabe, Datong, Pacific, and American Wireless Telegraph Company, have also decided to revise their prices from February 1. For example, telegraphs sent to various parts of the country and transferred through Hong Kong, including those in foreign languages and Chinese passwords, will be 1.2 yuan per word, and those in Chinese code will be 6 cents per word. Urgent telegrams will be doubled as usual. Telegraphs sent to Hong Kong will maintain the original price for the time being. As for telegraphs sent abroad, they will be decided after the General Directorate decides.</p>

<h3>During the Period of the Surge of Foreign Rice, Prevent Hoarding for Profit; The Rice Price Increase During the Spring Festival Last Year Can Serve as a Lesson</h3>
<p>The rice market will open today, and foreign rice will surge, and the price will fall. However, compared with the rice price of 40 yuan per stone last year and 85 yuan this year, the price per stone has increased by more than 40 yuan. In the summary of the eastern period last year, due to the high rice price, rice merchants saw that it was profitable, so they ordered a large number from foreign producing areas. After the Spring Festival, due to the large influx of foreign rice, each rice store had a trend of being unable to accommodate it, and the inventory reached more than one million bags, resulting in a sharp drop of more than 10 yuan per stone of rice. However, it was later acquired by speculators who had a large amount of floating capital, resulting in a further increase in the rice price at that time, reaching 100 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Rice Market</p>
<p>The current decline in rice prices due to the influx of a large amount of foreign rice is expected. However, after the decline, it is still necessary to prevent speculators from hoarding for profit and causing prices to rise again. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will prepare a proper method in advance. Before there are concrete methods, market transactions must comply with the method of selling to customers and businesses, and businesses selling to shops, so that the food prospects of the citizens can be assured.</p>
<p>Continued Shipping of Ordered Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association's 8,718 bags of ordered No. 2 Saigon foreign rice were loaded on the Hua Lun Foreign Firm "Gelan" before the end of last year and arrived in port. They have been sent to the ordering households by car. However, only one or two ordering households, such as the cooked water industry, will leave the station after the Spring Festival holiday. According to the association's report, the above-mentioned 8,718 bags of ordered rice are allocated to the 22nd to 29th batches of ordering households. There are also 4,000 bags that have been traded and will be shipped to Shanghai by a cargo ship within days. At that time, they will be allocated to the 30th batch of ordering households and will continue to register and order.</p>
<p>Actual Number of Rice Arriving</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, the influx of foreign rice into Shanghai was strong. The various situations have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Due to omissions during the holiday period, they are re-explored as follows: The Taikoo Company's Zhejiang ship arrived in Shanghai on the 24th, with 7,532 bags of foreign rice loaded from Siam and 9,618 bags from Hong Kong. The Kunming ship arrived in Shanghai on the 27th, also carrying 12,336 bags from Siam and 6,104 bags from Hong Kong. The Haikou ship arrived on the same day, carrying 10,029 bags from Hong Kong, and another 399 bags were originally shipped to Qingdao. The Jinan ship arrived on the 28th, carrying 12,246 bags from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson's Hesheng ship arrived in Shanghai the day before (29th), carrying 16,423 bags from Hong Kong. The above-mentioned, except for those transferred to Qingdao, totaled 74,288 bags, which, together with those reported yesterday, totaled 200,985 bags. There are still a large number of Burmese, Siamese, and Vietnamese foreign rice coming in the future.</p>
<h3>Good Labor-Management Relations in Six Telegraph Companies</h3>
<p>Five Demands Made by Messengers; Most Accepted by the Companies</p>
<p>The messengers of the six telegraph companies, American Pacific Submarine Telegraph Company, British Datong Submarine Telegraph Company, Danish Dabe Submarine Telegraph Company, American News Agency, Universal Wireless Radio Station, and Coast Radio Station, jointly submitted a written reason to the six companies at the end of last year due to the high cost of living and the inability to maintain a livelihood. They asked the six companies to increase wages and improve treatment, totaling five items. It is learned that the authorities of the six companies believe that the demands made by the messengers are purely a matter of livelihood and have no other purpose. They are deeply understanding and have accepted most of the five demands made by the messengers. The messengers believe that the company authorities are quite sincere, so the labor and management are now completely harmonious.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Passengers to Carry Banknotes to the Mainland</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed that passengers carrying banknotes to the border provinces for circulation, but not for export, should first apply to the Ministry of Finance for a Ministry Certificate, or report to the Ministry of Finance for special approval, and order the customs to inspect and release them if the amount carried is more than 3,000 yuan. If the passengers have to advance and cannot temporarily handle the above procedures, the competent customs should temporarily detain the excess banknotes carried, and then inspect, release, or return them after they have obtained the Ministry Certificate or reported to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>愷自邇路 Yesterday Morning Bloodshed: Ji Xiangqing Shot Dead, Two Men in Black Gowns Lay in Wait at the Alley Entrance, Firing Four Shots, Two Bullets Striking Ji's Vitals</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 9:45 AM, an assassination occurred at the entrance of Zhilanfang Alley on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession. The victim was Ji Xiangqing, the general manager of Huiyuan Bank. He was struck by two bullets on the spot, injuring vital organs, and died shortly thereafter. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Opening a Bank: Self-Appointed Manager</p>
<p>Ji Xiangqing was a native of Jiangyin, 36 years old, and resided in the west wing of the second floor of No. 7 Zhilanfang, 174 Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession. He opened Huiyuan Bank in Room 94 of the Dabuilding on Ningbo Road in the International Settlement, serving as general manager. He also concurrently served as a "Commissioner of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank." He owned a private car, license plate number 3438. At the end of the Qingli calendar year last year, he hired Chen Heying (34 years old), a native of Ningbo, as his chauffeur.</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot: Bullets Strike Vitals</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 9:45 AM, Ji, as usual, went to the Huiyuan Bank to work. At the time, Ji was wearing a dark blue Western suit, a leather overcoat, a dark gray felt hat, and leather shoes. As he entered the car like a prosperous merchant, and just as he drove out of the alley entrance, two men in black gowns were lying in wait on the inside. Spotting Ji's car approaching, they pulled out pistols and quickly fired four bullets at Ji. All the bullets pierced through the glass window, and two bullets struck his vitals – one bullet hitting his right temple and the other hitting the back of his head. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and he collapsed in extreme pain. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled with their weapons.</p>
<p>Dying Without Medical Attention: Breathing Ceases, Life Ends</p>
<p>After the incident, the alley gatekeeper and police officers arrived upon hearing the commotion. Seeing that Ji's breath was faint, they urgently telegraphed the French police station and also sent the chauffeur, Lu Heying, back to the residence to report the news to Ji's wife, Madam Shen (31 years old, native of Wuxi). She rushed out to see him, but Ji was already unconscious. Soon, Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station arrived by car, inspected the scene, and then summoned an ambulance to rush Ji to Guangci Hospital on Jinshenfu Road for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died approximately twenty minutes later.</p>
<p>Cause of Assassination: Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The body was transported to the autopsy room at the Delastour Road Small Hospital. It is reported that Ji has four young children. Police officers reportedly found several bullet casings at the scene of the incident and immediately took them back to the police station for inspection in order to track down the perpetrators. According to news from the Huaguang News Agency, Ji has been quite active in banking and financial circles recently. The current strict investigation being conducted by the French police concerns whether this sudden assassination is related to politics. Ji originally did not plan to go to the Huiyuan Bank yesterday morning, but before 9 AM, someone, falsely claiming to be a friend surnamed Mou, sent someone to Ji's house, urging him to go to the bank to discuss something. Only then did Ji respond to the call and leave the house, leading to his death by shooting.</p>
<h3>British One-Armed General Suggests Linking China and India Transportation, Using Chinese Products to Trade for Large Quantities of Military Supplies from Chongqing to the Bay of Bengal, India</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Mr. Sutton, a 56-year-old Englishman, once served as a major general under the old warlord Zhang Zuolin. Because he had no right arm, he was known as the "One-Armed" General. Currently, he is doing business in Hong Kong. Recently, he came to Shanghai to purchase machinery. He told reporters that he first brought mortars to China in 1921, going up the Yangtze River to Chongqing, and planned with General Yang Sen to set up an arsenal in Chongqing to manufacture mortars. Now, the Chinese army widely uses mortars. Sutton also said that China could build a light road from Chongqing to India, using human power to transport important export products from Free China such as tung oil, hides, and silk. Once they reach India, they can be transported by Indian railways to the Bay of Bengal and shipped overseas. On the return trip, military supplies can be transported back to China. Sutton concluded by saying that he hopes that after China achieves peace, it can control the flooding of the Yangtze River and control the water flow of the Yangtze River Gorges to generate electricity, and turn Hankou, which is rich in iron sand, into a large steel industry city comparable to Pittsburgh in the United States.</p>
<h3>Japanese Monopoly Plan for Inland River Navigation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Foreign Businesses Unable to Gain a Foothold, Chinese Businesses Entirely Excluded, Will Undoubtedly Be Limited by Guerrilla Activities</h3>
<p>According to sources in the navigation industry, the Japanese "Central China Inland River Shipping Company" has drafted a plan to control the entire inland river navigation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The content is extremely large. It expands a line north of the Yangtze River, expanding from the existing Nantong-Rufu line through Dongtai and Taixian to Xiannvmiao, and then westward to Bengbu and Huaiyuan. In the south of the Yangtze River, it expands twelve lines, with Suzhou, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, Kunshan, Danyang as the center.</p>
<p>Extending Shipping Routes</p>
<p>Each extends to nearby areas rich in products. It is said that this plan will be gradually implemented this year. In addition, the Japanese side also plans to open three canals between Jiaxing and Haining, between Jiaxing and Haiyan, and between Jiaxing and Gongchen Bridge, which will begin operation next month. Furthermore, according to the navigation industry, before the war, the inland river navigation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was very developed by Chinese and foreign businesses.</p>
<p>Excluding Dissidents</p>
<p>Since the occupation, foreign businesses have been forced to stop by 90%, and most Chinese businesses have also been devastated. Only a few have barely managed to survive out of necessity. The decline is incomparable to before the war. This Japanese plan will undoubtedly be restricted by guerrilla activities. However, if it is gradually implemented, not only will foreign businesses be unable to gain a foothold, but Chinese businesses will also be entirely excluded.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Golden Jubilee</h3>
<p>75 Years Since Founding</p>
<p>The Rotary Club of this city held a weekly luncheon yesterday to celebrate 75 years since founding. Salvation Army Morais spoke, saying that the Salvation Army has decided to raise 175,000 yuan this year to engage in various charitable undertakings. During his speech, Morais recalled the history of the Salvation Army, saying that the organization was founded by William Booth 75 years ago and has now reached the "Diamond Jubilee." The organization's flag is now flying in 97 countries around the world. Salvation Army members do not have fixed salaries. The organization sometimes has economic difficulties, and even the money to buy food for its staff is scarce. Morais then listed various plans to be carried out by the group, as well as the number of people and expenses needed. The beggar shelter currently accommodates 1,052 beggars, including two newly born babies. The shelter hopes to help those familiar with making a living and soon be able to resume their old careers. After the luncheon, Rotary Club President Bosaiven gave a brief speech, stating that establishing a beggar shelter is a benevolent act, and the Rotary Club is very interested in it. When mentioning the Salvation Army, he said that the organization has "revealed the spirit of Christ without reservation."</p>
<h3>Impersonating Woodhead, Distributing Circulars</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Woodhead, the editor of the "Oriental Affairs" magazine, received a letter this morning (the 30th) with great surprise, because the letter was a printed circular issued by L.K. Kentwell, the editor of the "China New Voice" magazine in Nanjing, with an attached piece of paper that prominently read "Edited by Woodhead, China Yearbook and Oriental Magazine." These words are the same as those used by Woodhead to return manuscripts, but the font is different. Woodhead does not know if Kentwell sent the same letter with this piece of paper to others, but he wants to explain that these pieces of paper are all forged fakes. What makes Woodhead particularly embarrassed is that the letter advocates that "the British-ruled Shanghai International Settlement must be immediately returned to its rightful owner, China." (According to another report, Kentwell is a pseudonym for lawyer Gan Weilu.)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Releases Last Year's Shanghai Living Statistics, Rice, Rent, Coal Balls Skyrocket, Making Life Difficult, Minimum Living Expenses for a Family Require More Than 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the statistics section report of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department in the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report for last year, due to the rapid increase in the cost of living recently, the monthly living cost index for Chinese workers and Western expatriates compiled and released by this department and the study of workers' actual income are quite useful for adjusting workers' income. Many stores and factories adjust according to the changes in this index. This department also issues an average retail price list every week, which is used as a standard for rice subsidies and commodity allowances. In addition, those who come to this department to inquire about this issue are answered in detail. From this, it can be seen that the materials provided by this department are very important in social services. The main points are as follows: (A) The living conditions in Shanghai in 1940.</p>
<p>Western Expatriate Living</p>
<p>The Bureau and the public expected very high numbers, so the average quantity of household consumption obtained from the survey in the three months from October to December 1939 was used as the weight, and the provisional living cost index for Western expatriates in this city was first compiled.</p>
<p>Composite Index: The retail prices in 1940 rose month by month, so the overall trend of the provisional composite living cost index for Western expatriates also continued to rise without ever falling back. The index for this year was 149.15, starting at 114.48 at the beginning of the year and reaching 180.21 in December, an increase of 65.73 points compared to January, with an average monthly increase of 6.41 points. Compared to the base period of October 1939, the purchasing power of the national currency decreased by 12.65% in January and continued to decrease to 44.51% in December. In the twelve months, the total index for American expatriates increased by 59.41 points, the British by 62.78, the Russians by 67.61, and other expatriates by 66.62 points, among which the increase in the index for Russian expatriates was the highest.</p>
<p>Chinese Workers Living</p>
<p>The total living cost index for workers increased from 203.25 last year to 438.22 this year. Compared to the currency value in 1936, the purchasing power of the national currency also jumped from 4 jiao 9 fen 2 li last year to 2 jiao 2 fen 8 li 2 hao this year, a decrease of 2 jiao 6 fen 3 li 8 hao. The total index for this year was lower only in March, April, and August. The total index for December was 579.70, an increase of 254.26 points compared to January, with an average monthly increase of 232 points. In January of this year, the purchasing power of the national currency was still 3 jiao 0 fen 7 li 3 hao, but it decreased to 1 jiao 7 fen 2 li 5 hao in December. The largest increase this year was in the food category, followed by miscellaneous items, clothing, fuel, and rent. At the end of the year, the food category index had exceeded the 650 mark, the fuel category was at 550, and the miscellaneous category was at 450.</p>
<p>In the retail prices in the index, the weights of rice, fuel, and rent are heavier than others for worker consumption goods, and among these three, rice is the heaviest. Generally, all goods have increased in price, but the increase in these three is of great concern and should be discussed separately. (a) Rice: Before the incident, the retail price of No. 2 japonica rice was only 11.066 yuan per stone, and No. 1 indica rice was 10.373 yuan. In February of this year, the price of No. 2 japonica rice rose to 45.427 yuan, and No. 1 indica rice was replaced by No. 2 Saigon rice, which also rose to 45.312 yuan. In March, the price of No. 2 Saigon rice fell slightly, but due to insufficient rainfall and a large contraction in foreign exchange in May, the price rose again. It fell back again in August and has continued to increase since October, reaching 81.802 yuan per stone, an increase of 120.49% compared to January of this year and 688.61% compared to July 1937.</p>
<p>(b) Coal Balls: In July 1937, the average price was only 1.100 yuan per 100 catties. It was 1.947 yuan in 1938 and 2.573 yuan last year. It was 4.277 yuan in January of this year and rose to 8.150 yuan in May. It fell slightly from June to September and rose again in October, reaching 8.388 yuan in December, an increase of 96.12% compared to January and 662.55% compared to July 1937.</p>
<p>(c) Rent: In the six months from July to December of this year, the rent for flat houses increased by 17.76% compared to last year and 278.55% compared to July 1937. The rent for stone gate buildings increased by 28.01% compared to last year and 239.66% compared to July 1937. The increase in rent not only increases the burden but also leads to crowded living conditions, and the health problems are even more serious.</p>
<p>Factors Affecting the Cost of Living</p>
<p>Although wholesale prices fell and foreign exchange improved in some months of this year, retail prices did not fall, so the living expenses of Chinese workers and Western expatriates did not improve as a result. Wholesale prices rose the most sharply in the first five months of this year and fell back in June, July, and August, and then rose again. When wholesale prices rise, retail prices also rise accordingly, but from June to August, retail prices did not decrease, and the impact on living expenses is self-evident. The foreign exchange rate fluctuates from time to time, and the impact on living expenses is less desirable than a low and stable rate. Once the exchange rate contracts, prices rise sharply, but they remain the same for a long time, so the more frequent the fluctuations, the higher the prices will be, and there will be no decrease in the bottom line. A linked study of the monthly fluctuations of retail prices and foreign exchange rates can prove this. (B) Wages and working hours (limited to Chinese factories) (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Payment Method for Unified Debt Principal and Interest, Telegram to Chongqing for Instructions</h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed with the four banks, namely the Central Bank, China Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, that the four banks will discount and pay for the unified revival gold long-term three bonds guaranteed by customs duties. The tenth principal and interest payment of the unified public bonds of the Republic of China in 1936, namely the B, C, D, and E bond tickets, is scheduled for January 31 according to the regulations. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has telegraphed the head office in Chongqing for instructions and has received a reply approving the start of discounting and payment from today. However, the bondholders must first fill out an application form and obtain a discount voucher from the paying bank, and then pay it off in six installments. The tenth principal and interest will be fully paid off by June 30. As for whether Shanghai will handle the discount payment, the reply did not mention it. The Shanghai Branch has telegraphed the head office again for instructions. The reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Branch last night but has not yet received a reply from the head office. The payment method and principles have been completely determined. Whether to pay in Shanghai or in Hong Kong and other domestic locations must wait for a reply before proceeding. It is expected that a reply will be received this morning.</p>

<h3>Niloria Unharmed, Arrived in Shanghai the Other Day, Not Lost in the Pacific Ocean, German Raider Active Near Bismarck Island</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Eastern and Australian Steamship Company's Niloria was overdue at the beginning of this month and did not arrive in Manila, causing some to worry that the ship had sunk. It was then reported that the ship had delayed its voyage to rescue survivors from a ship sunk by a German raider near Bismarck Island.</p>
<p>Ordered to Depart from the Route</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 29th), the ship arrived in Shanghai and moored at the old Ningbo Wharf. According to reports, the Niloria was recently on its way from Rabaul on New Britain Island in the Pacific Ocean to Manila when it received orders to depart from its route.</p>
<p>Transferring Rescued Passengers</p>
<p>It went to Imaru Island and rescued 496 survivors sent to the island by a German raider. It sailed to Brisbane, Australia, waited for the survivors to disembark, and then changed course to Manila. At the end of December last year, a German raider was active in the northeast of the Australian-administered Bismarck Islands.</p>
<p>Once All Communication Lost</p>
<p>Because the Niloria was out of contact after sailing out of Rabaul, the shipping industry was concerned that the ship had been intercepted by a German raider in the Pacific Ocean.

<h3>Economic Investigation of National Goods List, Shanghai Manufacturers All File Reports</h3>
<p>In order to protect the production of national goods and prevent the malpractice of counterfeiting national goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has issued national goods certificates separately for identification. However, in order to conduct strict inspections to avoid mixing genuine and fake goods, the Ministry previously issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments that the regulations for the issuance of national goods certificates by the Ministry have been promulgated and implemented. However, the internal organization of large and small manufacturers who have already received national goods certificates and various products have changed from time to time. If they are not inspected at any time, it is difficult to review them. For this reason, the Ministry has specially formulated implementation methods: (1) All manufacturers who have received national goods certificates shall fill in a statement of items every six months (half a year) and report it to the Ministry for record. The form is the same as the statement of items that should be filled in when applying for a national goods certificate. (2) The filled-in statement of items should be submitted to the local competent authority for transfer to the Ministry or sent to the local legal industrial and commercial organization for certification and directly submitted for verification. The certification procedures should be handled in accordance with the procedures for filling in and submitting the statement of items for applying for the issuance of a national goods certificate. The various national goods organizations and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in this city have received the notice separately and will submit all the forms that should be filled in according to the prescribed date. It is now known that all the large and small national goods factories in this city, in view of the special environment and the prevalence of inferior goods in the market, and due to the impact of transportation stagnation, the export of national goods has declined, but in order to take care of future business, all have tried to improve all kinds of products, and all believe that this measure by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is indeed the only good way to eliminate the counterfeiting of national goods, so all have filled in the above forms separately and submitted them to their respective national goods organizations for transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Zhejiang Line Has Generous Freight Rates, Risky Voyages</h3>
<p>Baoli Decides to Sail to Wenzhou Again, Publicly Selling Tickets and Loading Cargo</p>
<p>The Yishang Huayi Shipping Company's Baoli ship originally sailed on the Shanghai-Zhejiang route, but because the shipping on this route was difficult in the past, the ship company avoided other accidents and changed its route to Jiangbei at the end of last year. Since the voyage, the business has been sluggish and has been suspended once. It is now heard that since the New Year, several foreign shipping companies in this city, because the Shanghai-Zhejiang line has generous freight rates, have continued to sail without considering the safety of the voyage. The Baoli ship has also decided to resume sailing on the Shanghai-Zhejiang line and is scheduled to set sail for Wenzhou on February 5. It will stop at the Roosevelt Wharf to load cargo and publicly sell passenger tickets tomorrow and the day after.</p>
<h3>Business Corps White Russian Volunteer Members Have Been Assigned to the American Team, Strengthening the Defense Strength of the Central District</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's International Business Corps transferred more than 300 White Russian hired members of the Corps' C-Character Battalion to the police department on the 15th of this month, the Corps' structure has lost its stability. According to an investigation by a reporter from Pingming News Agency, among them, there is still a platoon of White Russian volunteer members in the C-Character Battalion, which originally belonged to the C-Character Battalion. Now that the C Battalion cannot form a battalion, the Corps Commander decided to reorganize it, abolish the original C Battalion, and reorganize the remaining platoon of White Russian volunteer members into the B-Character Battalion of the American team. Because the American B-Character Battalion originally had a serious shortage of personnel and was responsible for the defense of the central district of the International Settlement, the responsibility was heavy. Now, after incorporating a platoon of White Russian volunteer members into the B-Character Battalion, the effectiveness in garrisoning the central district is very strong.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have just read the article "Yue Opera Queen Yao Shuijuan Attacked with Excrement" and "Real Estate Agent Zhou Xuesong Also Suffers Excrement Attack" published on page 4 of your newspaper on January 30th. The part about Jin Rongfa on Panxing Road does not quite match the facts. Rongfa has always served in the French Municipal Council, behaving himself and never having anything to do with Zhou Xuesong being attacked with excrement. Although Zhou Xuesong initially mistakenly identified him, reporting it to the police station, Zhou Xuesong later realized his mistake and withdrew the charges. Therefore, Rongfa was not detained by the police station, and there was no apology from his family to the Zhou family. The information in your newspaper is probably based on inaccurate rumors, but as it concerns Rongfa's reputation, I cannot remain silent. I am therefore writing to request your newspaper to promptly make a correction. Respectfully, Jin Rongfa, January 28th.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Merchants Still Bringing in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC rates. The unofficial market for British and American currency saw more demand than supply as Chinese and foreign banks reopened today after the Spring Festival holiday. This led to a softer trend. HSBC's sale of US dollars for next month has stabilized the market somewhat, favoring the purchase of this month's forward exchange rate at 3.82 yuan. Heavy absorption of US dollars and purchasing by importers at noon led to softening. In the afternoon, British firm Sassoon's entry made it difficult to escape the tight situation, eventually closing at 3 shillings 3.75 pence for British gold and 5.375 yuan for US dollars. Compared to the noon close on the 25th, British was 0.046875 pence tighter, and US dollars were 0.0625 yuan tighter. Trading was extremely active throughout the day.</p>
<p>Favorable Absorption of US Dollars</p>
<p>Early morning saw London cables report a recent drop of 0.0625 pence, while forward rates remained stable. New York silver prices remained steady, and London gold prices were stagnant. Exchange rates between Britain and the US, Shanghai, etc., remained unchanged. The US dollar was slightly stronger against the British pound, up by a quarter against Shanghai, and inactive against the French franc. Central bank rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 4.375 pence for British gold and 5.4375 yuan for US dollars, which was unchanged for the US dollar and 0.015625 pence higher for the British pound compared to before the holiday (last Saturday). After opening, HSBC first sold US dollars for February at a rate of 5.375 yuan, and speculators released some, selling US dollars for January to Macao at 5.4375 yuan. However, the buying interest was strong, with foreign firms selling US dollars for January at 5.4375 yuan. At 9 o'clock, HSBC's rates were announced, and all exchange rates remained unchanged. The silver tax was low at 0.50 percent. Subsequently, Beneficial Securities sold off British gold for this month, leading to a slight softening, with rates at 3 shillings 4.0625 pence. At the same time, foreign firms had sudden needs, leading to even tighter potential, with February British gold settling with foreign firms at 3 shillings 3.4375 pence. The situation remained the same at noon, with the closing prices for spot and this month's US dollars at 5.40625 yuan and British gold at 3 shillings 3.75 pence. February US dollars were at 5.34375 yuan, and British gold was at 3 shillings 3.134375 pence.</p>
<p>Sassoon's Eager Buying</p>
<p>Sassoon had a strong buying intention in the aftermarket, and foreign banks were still willing to supply, resulting in a balanced market. Sassoon bought in large quantities, with current month Guangling at 3 shillings 3.75 pence, and the same month's US dollars at 5.40625 yuan. Later, trading gradually decreased, and the closing price stabilized, with US dollars continuing to slightly contract. Spot and this month were quoted at 5.375 yuan, British gold at 3 shillings 3.75 pence, next month's US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, and British gold at 3 shillings 3.4375 pence. Compared to the pre-holiday closing prices, British gold spot and forward contracts sharply contracted by 0.046875 pence, and US dollars near-term tightened by 0.0625 yuan, while long-term softened by 0.03125 yuan.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Desires to Rise, Then Returns</h3>
<p>Spot is Already 30 Yuan Higher than Futures</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold dark market resumed trading as usual after the Spring Festival holiday. In the early morning, sentiment was buoyant, and the opening price immediately rose by 30 yuan compared to before the holiday, to 6,680 yuan. Driven by strong buying from Ren Chengyong and banking groups, it rose beyond the 700 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,720 yuan. Later, due to sales from securities firms Dafeng and gold firm Taikangcheng, it was pushed down twice to 6,620 yuan. With support from banking groups and late purchases by Xinyuan and exchange dealers, it stabilized at a closing price of 6,650 yuan, equivalent to the pre-holiday closing price. Spot was reportedly 30 yuan higher than futures, prompting some to buy, with swaps done at 220 yuan. In the afternoon, the industry temporarily decided to close the market early, with only half-day trading, amounting to three to four thousand taels. Gold jewelry prices in gold shops remained unchanged, still quoted at 680 yuan. Customs duties, etc., were flat.</p>
<p>Burned Remnants Without Identity, Honor or Disgrace</p>
<p>Early in the morning, with invigorating sentiment, buying interest at the opening was quite strong. Banking groups initially traded 20 taels, at 6,680 yuan, 30 yuan higher than the closing price before the holiday (last Saturday). Ren Chengyong vigorously purchased hundreds of taels, and banking groups also bought, suddenly driving the price beyond the 700 yuan mark, with a high of 6,720 yuan. Subsequently, it fluctuated, and securities firm Dafeng and gold firm Taikangcheng sold, immediately causing a decline, retreating within the 700 yuan mark, falling to 6,620 yuan. However, due to the softening exchange market, banking groups Mingfeng and other banking groups took advantage of the low prices, suddenly generating buying interest, and it was pulled up by 40-50 yuan, reaching as high as 6,660 yuan. Unfortunately, securities firm Dafeng and gold firm Taikangcheng soon stirred up selling, and under heavy pressure, it fell to a low price of 6,618 yuan. Later, with purchases from Xinyuan and exchange banking groups, the trend was still upward. When the news of a shrinking US dollar rate arrived, the closing price returned to 6,650 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the pre-holiday close. In the afternoon, the industry temporarily decided to close the market early, with a fluctuation of 102 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash shops was more than 4 yuan higher than the price of burned remnants, and the purchase price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current standard gold was quoted 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, with little trading open.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Prices in Gold Shops Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price for gold jewelry in gold shops remained unchanged, with Datong Heng quoting 680 yuan, and new firms quoting similar prices, with a purchase price 30 yuan lower, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Increased Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of burned remnants return to flat after rising. British and American gold pounds finally stabilized. British currency was in very little demand, and the market price was slightly weak. US dollar notes initially traded at 18.27 yuan, then slightly retreated to 0.21 yuan, and peaked at 0.10 yuan at noon, finally reaching 18.32 yuan, which was 0.12 yuan higher compared to the holiday before the 23rd. Hong Kong notes slightly increased by one fen following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Demand for Japanese and Korean notes was significant, with the former reaching 1.58 yuan and the latter rising to 1.21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn - US Cotton Falls, Local Cotton Quiet</h3>
<p>New York cotton market initially rose due to buying from industry peers, then fell due to long positions closing and weakness in Wall Street stocks. The closing price was about eleven pound tones lower than the closing price. Indian cotton was halted. Yesterday's forecast, compared with the day before the market ended, predicted a high increase of about 5.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading was calm. As it was the beginning of the New Year, old customs had not been fully removed, and all parties were busy welcoming the God of Wealth and inviting opening market liquor, etc. Therefore, buying was not strong, and the market was quiet. As for the firm footing of raw cotton and the bullish market outlook, the trend will rise, and the market is just beginning.</p>
<h3>Economic Industry Talk</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Charcoal (1)</p>
<p>Charcoal is the leftover ash of firewood, that is, the unburned carbonaceous material. Before coal became prevalent, charcoal was used for warmth in winter, cooking, and industrial forging.</p>
<p>The discovery of charcoal was earliest. It is known that there was cooked food, firewood has been used, charcoal is a natural result of burning firewood. Charcoal made by specially burning wood in a kiln, that is, the commonly known charcoal. After burning procedures, a large production, for the public needs, it became a commodity.</p>
<p>Chinese people have used charcoal since ancient times. As stated in the Shangshu "the people fall into the mud and charcoal", (see Zhong Hui's Gaogao), mud metaphorically represents water, and charcoal metaphorically represents fire, which also means "the people fall into the midst of fire and water," indicating that the application of charcoal is very ancient. As for burning firewood into charcoal, there are also texts that can be found between the Zhou and Qin dynasties, such as the "Book of Rites - Monthly Orders," "When grasses and trees turn yellow and fall, then cut firewood for charcoal," which can be known.</p>
<p>Charcoal is made from firewood, so the place of production is not limited to one corner, but it must be mountainous villages rich in wood that can make charcoal. The charcoal used in the Jiangzhe area mostly comes from the Wintai area because the area is mostly mountainous and there is no fear of a shortage of firewood.</p>
<p>The mountains in the north are bare, so no charcoal is produced and coal is mostly used. Coal is coal because it comes out of the mines, as hard as stone, as black as charcoal. As mentioned in the "Book of the Former Han Dynasty - Geography", "Yuzhang County produces stone that can be burned as firewood", which is the type of coal. Sichuan produces a lot of bamboo, so it is also used to burn bamboo into charcoal, called bamboo charcoal. Song Lu You's "Lao Xue An Notes" has a cloud:</p>
<p>"The north has more coal, the south has more charcoal, and Shu also has bamboo charcoal, burning giant bamboo for it, easy to burn, smokeless, fire-resistant, also a strange thing. The iron produced in Qiongzhou is more beneficial for cooking and refining with bamboo charcoal, and the charcoal is all carried by ox carts."</p>
<p>As for burned charcoal, it mostly comes from the remnants of cooking stoves, placed in a cake urn, with a lid on top, or sealed with wet paper, to prevent air circulation, which becomes charcoal. The original name is floating charcoal, which means that it floats when thrown into water. In fact, 烰浮 and 浮 have the same ancient sound. In Bai Letian's poem, "Dusk half stove bran charcoal fire", written as "bran", later generations still mostly used 烰字. Lao Xue An notes, "In a handwritten manuscript of Chen Wu, there are more than ten articles, all entrusted to the liquor affairs official to buy floating charcoal, its poverty can be known". It can be seen that Song people still valued it as floating charcoal. It also said that "its poverty can be known", which is enough to show that floating charcoal is cheaper than other charcoal, which is also because the heating power of burned charcoal is weaker. However, burned charcoal is easy to start a fire, and coal is always used to attract it easily because its quality is looser than other charcoal</p>
<p>I have heard that the ancients had the elegant interest of gathering around a stove to talk and drink. At that time, there were no modern coal stove water Ting equipment, (now except for a few cities and a few families in the cities, most still use charcoal for heating), so well-to-do families often gathered around the stove for warmth, which could cook wine, make tea, and talk heart to heart, all in one fell swoop. Why must the stove be called a group? Because the surrounder describes its roundness. The round stove is set in the middle, and people around can sit around, so the stove is also named Weilu. Later, because the stove was not elegant, a large copper basin was used, and a round wooden base carved with flowers and painted with golden vermilion lacquer was used as a seat. Strips of charcoal were burned in it, and the fire was blazing, filling the room with spring. Some people threw spices and red dates into the charcoal to kill the strong smell. It is also known as a brazier. As recorded in the Dream of Red Mansions, when Jia's family performed ceremonies on New Year's Eve, in Yun's room, the ground was covered with red felt, and an elephant tripod with three legs of mud enamel fire basin was placed on the ground. Also, in Jia's mother's main room, burning pine and cypress incense and lily grass in the brazier, I want to see the gorgeous and rich atmosphere. (To be continued)</p>

<p>It is checked that the city's sugar inventory as of the closing is only more than 2,000 bags of Qing and Dongxiang red South Sea red in national sugar, and 121,476 bags in total of foreign sugar such as rough wheels and other systems. The storage quantity is detailed as follows</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous: New Year Goods are Expensive - Influenced by "Control"</h3>
<p>Last year, everything was expensive. Measured in legal tender, the expenses for one year were five or six times more than in previous years. However, the life still lived is extremely hard, mostly affected by "control" and "blockade". Prices are historically expensive, just talking about fruits, a small olive cost from five or six cents to two jiao, the tangerines sold by vendors all come from Nagasaki, Taiwan and other places, their color is orange-yellow, and their taste is bitter and sour. Shantou Mandarin oranges in China were rare and expensive due to the Japanese blockade, selling for 1.23 yuan per pound, and large ones sold for 56 jiao apiece. Sugarcane is best produced in Guang, but it is also obstructed by transportation and no goods have arrived. The sugarcane sold on the market is Zhehang Tangqi sugarcane, which used to sell for two jiao, and now sells for 78 jiao. The long-rooted sugarcane produced in Hangzhou sells for 1.56 yuan per root. The source of the "Yuanbao fish" on the fourth day of the new year is also subject to "control", and the price of those transported into the concession is very expensive. It was half the price of Qing fish in previous years, but now it is similar to Qing fish, from 1.56 yuan to 2.34 yuan per catty. A carp of more than one catty sells for 1.45 yuan, and some sell for 2 yuan.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Welcoming the God of Wealth</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>Last night was the day when most shops ate "Wealth God Wine," and today is said to be "Wealth God Day." So all the big and small stores are "opening with great luck."</p>
<p>However, there are now two ways to welcome the God of Wealth: one is to use pig's head, three animals, incense and candles, and ingots to respectfully worship the gods and spirits to "welcome the God of Wealth"; the other is to use modern scientific weapons - Blanc Lin, to "welcome the God of Wealth." In fact, as a joke, it is an undeniable fact that we should not be bound by the god-ghost fatalism today, so if it is a bit "realistic," the second method is more direct and quick.</p>
<p>But this is by no means to say that I am encouraging everyone to welcome the "living" God of Wealth and deliberately disrupting social order. This is a deliberately misunderstood statement, but it must be pointed out that welcoming the "dead" God of Wealth is a "trick" of eating "hollow glutinous rice balls." You think, even if you imagine it out of thin air, and according to legend that there are five Wealth Gods, then there are too many people who are welcoming them. Those "clay sculptures and wood carvings," the "Wealth Gods" in people's imagination, really have the suffering of "not being able to cope with it all," but because they "can't make a sound," everyone can't hear it. However, we must explain that welcoming the dead God of Wealth also has a "realistic" side - the meat shop, candle shop…and other southern shops, have already received a large "Wealth God business." This is probably also called the "flanking" defense of those who know "military strategy" quite well. But the ones who suffer are still those friends who eat "hollow glutinous rice balls"!</p>
<p>So, I say, today, we should still seek "substance" a little bit. Superstition and fantasy must be "seen off" in our hands, but we must pay attention that "substance" must also have conditions - who is right and who is wrong!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Daycare Center Established - A Blessing for Working Women</h3>
<p>— Anmin</p>
<p>Many people who oppose women's employment always use the child issue as a magic weapon for argument. What a "future master" the child is, and that women who take jobs will inevitably neglect the child—that is, disregard the "future master." This charge is really not small. Therefore, it has become a matter of course for women to return to the family.</p>
<p>But in fact, it is not entirely true. The "child problem" can be solved, and there is no shortage of precedents in other countries. That is to organize daycare centers.</p>
<p>Now the Shanghai YWCA has organized a Shanghai Daycare Center. The address is at 37B Breen Road, Tongren Hospital. Registration starts today at the YWCA at 323 Muirhead Road. As early as last July, they organized a preparatory committee and hired specialized personnel to serve as members. Detailed plans were considered, and now the merit is fulfilled. It is truly a blessing for working women.</p>
<p>Daycare centers can not only solve the child-raising problems of working women, but also a happiness for children themselves. Because the nurses and nannies in the center have all received specialized training and have a basic knowledge of children's physiology and psychology. Secondly, children grow up in collective life, and the concept of the group will naturally be deeply imprinted on the young mind. Our future masters should be collectivists, not flowers in a greenhouse.</p>
<p>Because it is the first time to start, the number of places in the center is temporarily limited to 100. As for the admission qualifications are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Parents must have a job and the income cannot afford the appropriate education of children.</p>
<p>2. Must be examined by a doctor and have no diseases.</p>
<p>3. Pass the intelligence test.</p>
<p>4. Must be introduced by a group or individual, and fill out the registration form in detail.</p>
<p>5. Those with special circumstances and verified by investigation.</p>
<p>As for the age of children, it is tentatively set from newborn to three years old. The length of stay is temporarily set for one year. After redoing the procedures, it can be continued. (Contact the YWCA for a prospectus for details.)</p>
<p>But everything is difficult at the beginning, so the YWCA authorities sincerely hope for the sponsorship and cooperation of people from all walks of life. Now they need the following items:</p>
<p>Cloth, towels, toys, furniture, potty, baby bottles, milk powder, soap, blankets, quilt, scales, medical supplies, etc.</p>
<p>People from all walks of life who wish to donate, please send to the Shanghai Daycare Center Office of the YWCA. Or notify the above address so that someone can be sent to collect. Enthusiastic people who wish to donate cash are also welcome. Donors take children as a unit, donating 20 yuan per person per month for living expenses, and 240 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Daycare centers are a social undertaking, and the joint efforts of the public can have a satisfactory harvest. Now is the so-called "Spring Festival" time, where can rich people not save a little money, if they can use it to benefit children and benefit society, it is truly immeasurable merit!</p>
<h3>Grand Hotel</h3>
<p>— Qishui</p>
<p>Grand Hotel, quite a "decent" grand hotel, business is really lively, every room is full.</p>
<p>At least one table of mahjong in each room, two girls, right!</p>
<p>Uncle Zhao and Ma Xiaokai sat on the soft sofas, cigars in their hands, UB at their mouths, comfortably staring at rows of photos. On the square table next to them, mahjong tiles were spread all over, and Chairman Li and Wang Maiban were sitting on the mahjong tiles in a daze.</p>
<p>"Ma Xiaokai, this one's 'appearance is nothing'." Uncle Zhao finally opened his mouth with great emotion.</p>
<p>"Okay, pick another one, tell the room service 'just that old business with gold teeth.'" The two were like buying goods, picking the best and fattest to slaughter at will. Only then did they say, "Room service, room service!" The room service quickly responded and entered.</p>
<p>"Make a phone call, must have this one! Number three, number seven, hurry up!" Uncle Zhao's voice and expression were fierce.</p>
<p>As the room service scurried out like a mouse, a pot-bellied man came along the aisle, and the room suddenly stirred:</p>
<p>"Oh, Boss Zhang, please sit down, please sit down, …"</p>
<p>"They're all here, what a coincidence, what a coincidence." As soon as Boss Zhang sat down with a plop, Wang Maiban hurried to light a cigar and pour UB.</p>
<p>"Hey! Why aren't you guys playing mahjong?" Boss Zhang felt strange.</p>
<p>"Look, three short of one ah. Ma Xiaokai especially likes to call people, said mahjong should be played slowly." Uncle Zhao shouted, pleading as if wronged.</p>
<p>"Sit down, sit down, it's not a table.</p>
<p>"The mahjong tiles began to be active: "Whirring."</p>
<p>The room service scurried in again</p>
<p>"Sir," that's right, number three, number seven is here."</p>
<p>"Ha, quickly invite them to sit down, quickly invite them to sit down." The four people spoke in unison, with some eyes wide open. Some were squinting into a line.</p>
<p>The sound of oriole: "Little Zhang, you've been waiting for a long time."</p>
<p>"Come over! Number seven, accompany Boss Zhang to play mahjong!" Ma Xiaokai issued the order with absolute sanctity and seriousness, Boss Zhang was indeed a distinguished guest with "color" on the seat.</p>
<p>…Laughter filled the room.</p>
<p>"Eight rounds are over, let's settle the accounts. Atlantic Ocean to go." Boss Zhang pushed the tiles, sighed, and felt hungry.</p>
<p>"Well, it's still early, room service bring the theater program!"</p>
<p>"Right! The New Year's Day three-day program is really authentic, excellent." Only then did Ma Xiaokai push number three away from his side, and lazily began to open his mouth.</p>
<p>"Well, but, oranges must be bought in advance, too late…" The rat-headed Wang Maiban was the most refined, thinking of everything.</p>
<p>"Then make a phone call, and book a private room." Uncle Zhao showed his great power, easily spread his hands.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaokai randomly pulled out fifty yuan for number three and number seven: "Accompany us to the theater again tonight."</p>
<p>"Thank you…" But tears rolled down his throat, and unknowingly a sneeze "Ah shoo!"</p>
<h3>Squeezing and Pushing</h3>
<p>— Juehui</p>
<p>Everyone loves excitement. "The beginning of the year" brings a festive mood, so people try to squeeze through to the east and push to the west. If they can't squeeze, they push; if they can't push, they squeeze! If neither squeezing nor pushing works, they form a "long serpentine queue," which is also quite fun...</p>
<p>Because it's "once a year," people you don't usually see all come out; achievements you don't usually hear about also come out; in short, everyone comes out! So you squeeze me, I push you. The grand occasion is indeed unprecedented, but not without future occurrences!</p>
<p>January 28th, no! It's "the second day of the Lunar New Year." Amusement parks and movie theaters are packed to the brim. People refuse to leave if they can't buy tickets; anyway, squeezing and pushing, looking and seeing, is considered "worth the trip."</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire is not heard, and the smell of sulfur is not detected. Taking advantage of tonight, seeking pleasure, everyone squeezes, everyone pushes!</p>
<p>But you also have to be careful not to get pushed into the Huangpu River, because you can't be "pushed" down from there! Isn't that right?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Things must rot from within before worms can bore into them!" He seemed to hear Shaowen's voice echoing in his ears: "Because you opera singers often mix with women from good families, people will treat you as playthings! As long as you keep yourself pure, not to mention a garrison commander, even the president or the grand marshal wouldn't dare to look down on you!"</p>
<p>Therefore, Begonia always focused intently on his performance on stage. Even though he knew that many beautiful women were sending electric glances to tempt him, he dared not return their gaze.</p>
<p>But the Wang family's daughter-in-law was truly special among many women. She was not only willing to spend time but also willing to spend money. At the Guangdelou, a ticket seller, bribed generously by her, sent several sets of costumes backstage. Although Begonia did not accept them, she had spent at least several hundred dollars! Afterward, Begonia's home continuously received many generous gifts from an anonymous person, clearly the woman's painstaking effort. Unfortunately, Begonia's will was not as easily overturned as that of ordinary young men. At the same time, Yuan Shaowen, as a good friend, constantly urged him, so he never did anything wrong.</p>
<p>Probably only later did she discover that Rongkui was the closest person to Begonia. To achieve her goal, this person was the best helper. Therefore, she sent her most trusted old nanny to represent her to suffer Yuan Shaowen's scolding on Rongkui's behalf. When she returned to the First House, she bumped into this "fake matchmaker," who was three or four times older than the "real Hongniang," outside the backstage door. Before he could speak, she routinely handed him a red paper packet, round and hard. The moment Rongkui touched it, he immediately knew that another ten dollars had come his way.</p>
<p>Money is the most precious treasure in the world; it can make people die or live, let alone these small errands? And Rongkui's conscience wasn't really bad. He felt that if he took someone's money, he should do something for them. Anyway, the Wang family's daughter-in-law wasn't some venomous snake or beast. Would Begonia be swallowed up if he met her?</p>
<p>"Okay, leave a number, and I'll call you if I get a chance!" As soon as Rongkui thought this, he became even bolder, as if this was something he should do. (18)</p>

<p>"We are young people, we cannot be slaves forever, we must chase our own happiness back."</p>
<h3>After Watching La Fayette's "Home"</h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>"Home," "Spring," and "Autumn," this continuous trilogy, can be said to be representative of Ba Jin's creations. When I saw "Home," although I didn't grow up in a large family or under a feudal system, I still finished reading it with tears, moved by the faithful and touching depiction of the collapse under the crushing wheels of the new era.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Ba Jin is a writer who has always stood at the forefront of the times. He has a vast audience, and his creations are widely spread in every different class and corner. We know that when he started writing "Home," Juexin, surrounded by enemies, was forced to die under the heavy feudal evils. But when writing "Autumn," Guangzhou was writing in an air-raid shelter under the threat of bombs. Young people in the great era should no longer be cowardly. So we can see in "Autumn": Juexin, surrounded by thorns, is still living stubbornly. He destroys the outline of the "Home" and changes the proposed surrender. In the torrent of the times, that is the dross.</p>
<p>Because the background of "Home" is a large family full of feudal remnants, the situation hidden inside, the floating of people, is very complicated. When I heard that the Shanghai Drama Society had adapted "Home" into a play for performance, I felt immense joy. But I couldn't help but have some doubts. If this "Home," with hundreds of thousands of words and complex characters, were to be performed compactly and clearly in just three hours, I was a little worried that the original essence would be lost. However, unexpectedly, at the La Fayette Theater, after seeing "Home" under Wu Tian's moving adaptation, I felt immense satisfaction.</p>
<p>The curtain opens at the Gao mansion, during the New Year's Eve family reunion. The Gao patriarch, with four generations under one roof, discovers that Juehui is not there. Although the school has already started winter vacation, he is still busy with meetings and running the weekly newspaper. So a group of stubborn conservatives, especially Grandpa's friend Feng Leshan as the central pillar, and the Keming and Ke'an faction, sigh greatly. Isn't that a Western school, studying Western things? Although their own decadent private lives are all worthy of criticism. But the younger generation, especially Juehui, who have been baptized by modern culture, he curses the large family with feudal remnants. He loves his eldest brother Juexin, but even hates him, he is too cowardly and unresisting, enduring everything. When his two brothers have any outrageous (?) actions, Grandpa only asks Juexin. You and I are young people, we must drag our own happiness back, one-sided endurance, you killed cousin Mei, and killed the elder sister-in-law, not enough? Let the eldest brother come to endure, do you want to repeat this tragedy on Juemin again? So we ourselves, must solve the problems. Juemin starts to flee the marriage, "You are a believer of evil forces." Juehui can no longer stay in this murky and shadowy family for even a minute, for his own longing future, he resolutely abandons his beloved brothers, although each of them loves deeply, their thoughts however form a significant divide in their era, Juehui finally leaves</p>
<p>The story is familiar to us, the script is faithful to the original work, and the director's technique is very close and detailed, especially the characterization. Like Keding's unwitting confession in front of Grandpa, smoking opium, and owing debts, his oily and sniffling demeanor; when the Gao patriarch asks Feng Leshan how the fireworks are, he stares unblinkingly at the head of the Wufeng, uttering double entendres, which is very clever.</p>
<p>The actor Xu Li's Juexin is the most vivid, on the one hand, he is subject to the high pressure of feudal remnants, on the other hand, the newborn force directly confronts him, he is full of painful contradictions. Yingzi plays Mingfeng's loneliness, Lan Lan plays cousin Mei's poignant and moving, two unfortunate people but respectively perform absolutely different effects. Yan Jun makes an entrance with a humorous posture, his close-up of a clown, in the tragic atmosphere, precisely achieves a degree of adjustment. Other Xia Xia, Han Fei, Hu Dao, and Dai Yun are all very competent. The setting is also pleasing.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am full of emotions. After watching "Home," I shed my cheap tears. On the way home, I repeatedly thought of a sentence said by Juexin: "We are young people, we cannot be slaves forever, we must chase our own happiness back."</p>
<h3>Walt Disney's Many Faces of Donald Duck</h3>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I recently read an article in your publication on the 21st, introducing the news of "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water," which stated that, in addition to our school's drama club, Fudan students have recently organized a "Yunhai Drama Club" led by Huang Jiaxiang...etc. After investigation, our club members, in addition to dedicating themselves to the club's affairs, have no spare energy to engage in extracurricular activities, and Mr. Huang Jiaxiang is not a member of the Water Club. I should state the above.</p>
<p>Fudan Drama Club</p>
<p>The copperplate engraving in the 23rd issue of this publication was of Bao Lian Gaodai and Luo Bobo Lei Si Deng, hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Walt Disney's New Work "Fantasia" Premieres in New York Stokowski Composes the Music for This Film The Greatest Musical Cartoon Film</h3>
<p>— Xia Sha</p>
<p>The creator of "Snow White" and "Pinocchio" recently had another collection of musical cartoons, including eight short films, all accompanied by classical music, the general name of the film is "Fantasia." Moreover, the protagonists in the cartoons are all new types, only one short film uses Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>"Fantasia" has been having a "world premiere" in a Broadway theater in New York since mid-January. Because the cartoon collection is both educational and musical, it can be effective in all aspects. Among the guests were photographers, musicians, colorful artists, technical experts, movie stars, stage stars, journalists, famous drama critics, and thousands of spectators from all walks of life, most of whom were music lovers and innocent children.</p>
<p>Walt Disney put all his efforts into it, so the dubbing, characters, and colors of the cartoon collection are more advanced than any of his previous works. Half of the box office revenue on the premiere day was allocated to the British war relief fund. After each short film was screened, it was followed by continuous applause and cheers. The eight short films lasted two hours and forty-five minutes, but the beauty of the music attracted them, which was truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that the great musician Stokowski, Garbo's lover, is the composer of the interludes for Walt Disney's film. He said that he wanted the audience to vividly see the artistic images of the cartoons and appreciate its moving and pleasant sounds. He said that he wanted to give the audience the feeling of hearing the sound of the spring flowing beside the mountains, hearing the songs of the shepherd boys, hearing the gentle sound of the wind, hearing the songs of the birds; and Leder Disney's "Fantasia" did achieve this, it is a great musical cartoon film.</p>
<h3>Hollywood's New Prophecy</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>Hollywood astrologer Motisse always makes a surprising prophecy at the beginning of each year. His predictions last year, which were published in this column, such as a young student becoming extremely popular, Ke Fulanxi's box office plummet, and the emotional breakdown of Taylor Bauer and his wife, were all accurate. This year's prophecy is divided into two parts, which were published in the New York Weekly Mirror in succession, and now a translated excerpt is as follows, waiting for the facts to prove it.</p>
<h3>Development of the Film Industry</h3>
<p>1941 will occupy an important position in film history, with less profit perhaps being enough to create better results, while also providing movie fans with better tastes.</p>
<p>In 1941, there will be a batch of new talents on the screen. Many famous film actors retire, which is the day for a group of newcomers to show their talents. This group of people will slowly gain support.</p>
<p>The criticism from movie fans should be more intelligent and sharp, they first want a good story, and this requirement has a great effect on the film industry.</p>
<p>American patriotic films will rise in time, and A-level films and B-level films will no longer be distinguished.</p>
<p>Overseas market box office decreases, but this can make the film company's internal affairs more concentrated.</p>
<p>Word of mouth from movie fans is far more effective than publicity, they see a good story, and will inevitably promote it to friends, which is enough to improve the filmmaker's selection of stories.</p>
<p>Glamour will not be important, and male and female actors who focus on performance will have more opportunities to perform, and what movie fans are most fascinated and interested in is their performance ability.</p>
<p>Will take more themes from South America and Australia.</p>
<h3>Li Yuru's "Hong Yuan Xi"</h3>
<h3>Hong Kong Snow White Li Jingbo and Rong Xiaoyi star</h3>
<p>Li Jingbo has been silent for a long time since he went to Hong Kong to film "The Long Journey" directed by Cai Chusheng. Now the news has come that, in addition to playing Sun Quan in "Beauty Trick," Li Jingbo is also starring in a "Night Hong Kong." The female lead is Rong Xiaoyi, and there are seven people assisting in the performance: Lin Kunshan, Yi Qiushui, Liu Guikang, Zhu Puquan, He Da Si, Da Kou He, and Ye Renfu. This film was originally planned to be called "The Tale of Snow White and Seven Friends." The plot is similar to "Snow White," but it is set in Hong Kong. Finally, it was changed to "Night Hong Kong." As for the person in charge of filming, it is Ren Huhua from the local press, who once filmed a "Bright Future," which was highly praised by public opinion.</p>
