<h3 id="c8">國際危局中如何主動運用 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>在當前這種危疑錯雜的國際情勢當中，最使人感到困難的殆無過於不易把握住時局發展的重心，因而對於前途展望也增加了無限迷惘和焦灼。就此際種種而言：最近全世界所關切的局勢在太平洋，同時也是各民治國近頃所着意戒備的所在：然而太平洋問題顯然並不是個獨立的範疇，其演變關鍵至少還有一半在於歐局角逐的動向。更就歐局而諭：近三月來，戰事始終僅在地中海兩岸發展，最近有如巴爾幹的動盪，艾登狄爾的赴埃，都表示着那一角落正吸引着交戰國雙方的重大注意力；但是倘若軸心國確已準備在不久將來發動對英攻勢，却未必選擇情况複雜且對於大局前途缺少決定作用的巴爾幹爲最有利的對象。至於軸心之於英倫，其未來戰略究將在潛艇的嚴厲封鎖，大軍的渡海登陸，空襲的擴大進行等等途徑中，如何抉擇運用，還是待決問題。而且在所有可能施行的戰略之中軸心方面究將集中全力於一個與一種單一的攻勢，不是兼營並顧，多方呼應，也難於驟作過早的判斷。更何况神經戰爭，煙幕作用，都爲今日侵略者所慣用的技倆，更不免性。</p>
<p>以此際民治國家應變準備與一年以前相較，一切顯在急劇進步之中，各方佈置雖未必恰如天衣無縫的理想，而可供侵略者利用的機會則確已日漸縮小；即在已往，除却中國奮戰之外，一一切絕無準備的遠東，亦因英美的空前積極警戒和增防而較曩時遠爲增强，逐漸達到不怕侵略挑釁的境地。這當然是已往種種慘苦敎訓的結果，這是舉世同情於民治國家者所引爲欣慰的。但是善於利用人類一般心理的侵略者，假如沒有絕對把握，大槪總不會在對方緊張戒備之際冒昧有所發動；相反的，他到要造做種種疑陣和僞裝，使人陷於　恍迷離，然後再趁對方警戒鬆弛疲敝之際，從事突擊。就往事來看：納粹首領便是最擅長此種戰略的人物，而日本方在亦步亦趨的模倣。目前歐局的極端混沌，太平洋情勢的表面緩和，都是由於侵略陣綫此種策略的運用。他們至今依舊保有主動的地位和形勢，這從「春季攻勢」這一名詞的存在可資證明，同時也就是上述世人對於時局前途難於把握的主因。這在民治國家方面，雖然其目今的防綫幾已擴大到地球上一半的領域，雖然在北非中東等地，英軍的進攻已能獲得重大成就，但就全局來看，還只是發揮了守勢的本色。</p>
<p>就軍事原則講：進攻是戰爭的主要動作，攻勢是戰爭的主要形態；申言之，發揮戰爭的意義，完成戰爭的使命，至少亦必繫於戰爭最後階段的一個攻勢。至於守禦，或是戰爭過程中間的一種策略，或是到達最後階段之前的一種步驟。再加析論：攻勢的功用，除了在最後階段用以決定勝利而外，在其他的各階段之中，亦每每儘可能的採行攻勢，庶幾易於保持戰略的主動地位，或爭取主動地位，亦即所以把握優勢。優勢雖視力量，亦視攻守的戰略。主動地位則所以自由發揮智能，自由支配力量，以選擇最有利於自已的時機與目標以及動作。根據了上述的這些事理，得以從他的反面，了解黏滯於守勢的那一方面，在戰爭中怎樣的不利；若對方靜則提心吊膽的多方戒備，對方動貝亟於因應而疲於奔命，總之是在被困擾之中。去春英法聯軍的慘敗，除却兵力戰具方面原因而外，甘茂林死守馬奇諾防綫的戰略該負重大的責任。更如中日之戰，中國因爲强弱懸殊，不能不運用以時間換空間的戰略，却絕不黏滯；已往三年半中，若干具有重大成就的戰役，沒有一次不是得力於運動戰略，同時也就是在攻守二者之間作靈活的配合。至於目前的國際戰局，雙方實力消長的趨勢，固然是民治國的增强與侵略者的削弱，但直到此際，軸心陣綫的主動地位尚非僅僅施用壓力予以坐困所能摧破，而其正在醖釀中之撲朔迷離的未來攻勢，至今仍爲民治國家方面以及全世界具有正義感的人們，在精神上與實際上所感受的車壓。因爲這樣，不能不承認較多較妙的神經戰爭的武器，落在他們手裏：不只世人視綫可能被擾到眼花撩亂，就連列强當局，有時也可能的爲所困擾；稍一不察，易被聲東擊西的技倆所欺。是以目前負有戢止侵略的重大任務者，除却竭力增强實力與加緊戒備而外，更應該迅速的積極的規畫到主動運用之取得。時間是各民治國的，勝利是各民治國的；但是不事及早取得主動運用，則侵略者陸續膨漲所得的空間，亦足以使民治國家方面的時間的價値，爲之削减，甚或爲之抵銷。勝利是絕對的信念，但迂緩却是勝利者之陰險的敵人啊！</p>
<p>各民治國家已經接受了侵略者的挑戰而踏入全面戰爭狀態之中了，侵略者的種種，不再是嘗試性質的窺伺了，不再是局部偶然的發動了。因此之故，對於它們已經發動的進犯，僅僅予以擊退是不夠的：對於它們正在策動的攻勢，僅僅予以防範遏止亦是不夠的。外科手術豈可僅施防腐藥劑而容留潰爛的存在，豈可以使潰爛的暫時進行緩慢而滿足。必須根本解除根本肅淸一切危害的現狀與根源，纔得確保世界的秩序，確保人類安寗，纔得光大文明，增進福祉。</p>

<p>倫敦市長郭克森爵士任期屆滿，市民依據特權，選舉新市長，於是年纔五十五歲英氣勃勃的喬治威金遜爵士就在大多數市民擁戴之下當選了。</p>
<p>倫敦市長就職禮，是英倫數一數一的大典。向例市長須帶了衆法官，乘馬車遊行全市，表示他的威風可以媲美帝皇。新市長並須在市政廳開張盛筵，款待佳賓。本屆新市長則因在戰爭期間，取消遊行，晚宴也縮小範圍，改爲午餐，俾與戰時食物統制條例相符。餐時旣無雉鳩湯和金碟子，餐後也沒有表不愛意的白葡萄酒。貴婦們晚裝的珠飾也無炫耀的餘地。市長夫人本來應該有男童一名替他捧裙裾，女儐六名隨侍一旁，恍如皇后登基一般，這次也都取消了。</p>
<p>新市長就任的一天，倫敦發出緊急空襲警報，預示德機的來臨。但威金遜爵士仍准時到市政廳舉行就職禮，繁文褥節雖然省去，莊嚴隆重却仍不損毫末，邱吉爾首相也照例躬親參加。</p>
<p>倫敦市民享有選舉市長的特權，由來已久。七百餘年前，國王的翰專制無道，倫敦市民奮起反抗，與之的法三章，取得自洽和選舉市長的權利。這偭權利一直到現在沒有動搖過。</p>
<p>倫敦市長在市區一方哩內，具有無上的權力。那怕國王入城，也須由市長代表市民授予鑰匙和寳刀，方許入內，一輩王親國戚照例都要讓他三分。全國任何軍隊，倘無市畏特許，不得結隊過市。僅有舊時倫敦地方軍改編的少數隊伍，可以上了刺刀，揚着軍旗通過，但也必須事前知照市長。</p>
<p>倫敦警察是獨立的部隊，在承平時共有一千餘名。市長手下有一堂法官。他並兼任市參議會，及各種市政委員會的主席。總之，這一方哩之內，全是他的天下。</p>
<p>倫敦市長旣有如此的太權，所以每逢新舊市長更迭，市民必定大事舖長，以示隆重。此次因爲國難期間，削去一些瑣屑禮節，已是非常不得已的了。</p>
<p>新市長就職典禮開始時，前任市長郭克森居中坐定，新市長威金遜夫婦分坐在他的左右，共次則爲邱吉爾首相和坎特伯萊大主敎分坐他們左右，市參議員們則各披薰衣圍坐議員席次。持杖官首先走近桌前，鞠三個躬，把權杖放在地板上，以示前市長任期已滿，於是由新市長威金遜宣誓就職畢，和前任市長對調坐位，完成新舊交替儀式。</p>
<p>新市長就坐定當，司儀官即把水晶儀杖，金笏租權章遞給前任市長，轉授新市長。此時市　官吏一一參見　任上司。持劍官交割儀劍，稍　又把它收去。持杖官拾起權杖，書記官呈上印信，審計官呈上受職文書及封綠表。最後前任市長移交市璽保管庫，醫阮，度支局衡器量　的鑰匙。每一官吏上前時都須三鞠躬，退下時亦然，好像覲見皇帝一般。倫敦市長的顯赫眞足以自豪了。</p>

<p>太平洋戰禍、能吾倖免、於中國之前途、又具若何影響、頗爲各方所關懐、昨據某外籍觀察家談、太平洋風雲是吾得以風消雲散、要以日本是否熱中南侵而定、日本自身旣以侵華而陷入泥淖中、無力足以自拔、但彼以軸心國之一、一切以盟主希特勒之馬首自瞻、希特勒攻英不下、驅日在遠東策應、以分英之勢、而使其戰事得以順利、日以除非德能勝英、或可分一杯羹外、別無其他善策、故其南侵作勢、雖若戰禍即將爆發、但英取得美之積極援助、而美又鑒於臂亡齒寒、爲固自身在遠東之利益計、殊非與英取同一步驟、增强遠東海空根據地，以與損害其利益者、周旋於太平洋上、不姑息、不讓步、決不予所謂主張「東亞共榮」者以坐收漁人之利、如些東亞共榮者」旣不能虛張聲勢、以嚇洪民主國陣綫、日如　量力、一度德、戰事或可不即爆發、萬一日本一意孤行、或估計英不能東顧、美決不至於參戰、而甘作禍首、則英美援華積極、不僅如今日之經濟而止、勢將更進一步而以軍專援助、使華增加軍事上之利器、以收夾擊之效、則中國作戰所引爲缺憾者惟軍械、至是全力反攻、有如摧枯拉朽、立足以制勝、</p>
<p>所謂和平不足憑信</p>
<p>著名評論家伍德海氏、昨日在英文大美週報發表一文、討論遠東之危機、略稱、日本外交官員所發之和平言論、所以不爲英美所接受者、其癥結在日本乃「不神聖轉心同盟」之一員、英美深恐日本此次所作之和平姿態、與德義從事侵略前之行爲相同、緣德國在侵略「低地國」之前、亦曾發表其和平意嚮、然不數日後、卽以侵略「低地國」聞矣、義大利在侵略希臘以前、亦曾提供保證、然數日後、亦不先行警吿、而向希臘侵略矣、此爲軸心國家之拿手好戲、因之、英美兩國之疑懼日本、殊有其充分之理由、</p>
<p>納粹人員在日活動</p>
<p>日本因最近曾通過一「國防秘密法」、禁止參加任何一目的在使外國獲利之活動」、禁止爲外國作宜傳活動、然納粹之秘密工作人員、在日本活動、盡力拉攏日本參加細心國以與英國作戰、此爲一公開之秘密、德國之目的、在將英國牽制於太平洋中、並分散美國之注意力、希特勒作此計劃時、祇爲其本國之利益着想、對於日本之利益、固未加以關心也、德國或能慷他人之慨、以遠東之土地給予日本、但不願在遠東見一與其敵對之帝國、此固不待智者而後知、</p>
<p>美國注視日本行爲</p>
<p>遠東局勢、現仍緊張、在短時期內且無鬆弛之象、美國國務卿赫爾有言曰、美國人判斷日本時、不觀察日本之言論、而觀察日本之行爲、但就日本之行爲而論、遠東戰爭之危機、固未消失也、美國對於日本之「東亞新秩序」計劃、從未表示同意、彼等對於日本將「東亞新秩序」擴充爲「大東亞新秩序」、更表反對、因此類計劃若吿實現、則美國在東亞之利益、勢將一掃而光也、</p>
<p>局勢至此無可容忍</p>
<p>美國衆議院開會時、曾對美國太平洋島嶼設防議案加以討論、足證美國對於日本過去之行爲、表示不滿、計劃將來在此處採取行動、去年美國擬在關島設防、然因日本之反對、不無顧忌、目下對日本之反嚮如何、美國巳置之不問、研究美國國會之辯論、即可知美國對日本之行動、已不能容忍、並拒絕用綏靖方法、改善兩國關係、在此種情形下、日本雖不認有侵略之意嚮、然局勢已至於此、決不能因日方之言論　而能望其改善也、英美之每一行動、雖純爲防禦性質、然皆足以表示對日本之不信賴也、</p>

<p>日軍竟尤貼補家用</p>

<p>不再宣傳只待解決</p>
<p>美國之反日宣傳、已不若過去之甚、因美國人民對於日本之仇視、固無待再事宣傳也、美國人又確信、遠東問題將有一最後之解決、門戶開放原則、不容漠視、美國利益、不容侵犯、美國民衆、無論老幼，無論南北、其中百分之九十五、固皆堅決反對日本、日人遇事生非之一切行動、已使美人之仇日心理、更形加强、</p>
<p>任何階層同一見解</p>
<p>當我人初抵舊金山時，曾與海關衛士閒談、因我人係來自遠東、故談話中心、無疑集中於遠東問題、該衛士之結論謂、一我人憎恨日本軍人、任何美國人皆願爲其祖國而與日本作戰」、我人又與旅館中之旅客、火車內之乘客、理髮店中之職員、新聞界中人士、討論此一問題、彼等之情緒、皆與該海關衛士相同、</p>
<p>政府決心民衆擁護</p>
<p>一言以蔽之、即　國不願釁自我開、然彼等不惜與日人一戰之心理、且較對德國爲强、雖彼等在歐洲之利益、較遠東爲大、蓋遠東問題所以由主要而轉於次要地位之原因、即基於是、時至今日、報紙已無需向美國民衆宜傳其同胞在遠東所受之痛苦、亦無需覺醒美國民衆、認本國政府之政策爲準確、而美國政府在民衆熱烈擁護下、殆已具有決心矣、</p>

<p>七年前，余往倫敦，出席世界經濟會議，道經紐約，曾向諸君演講日本攘奪中國東三省問題，謂此問題，在一般美國人感想中，或以爲遼遠無關之事件，但此實爲國際上掠奪行爲之開端，如不及時制止，則得步進步，勢必成爲可怕而有效之先例，演成其他非法行動，非使全世界悉牽入遊渦不止。數日後，余抵倫敦，在英國衆議院向當日外長西門爵士主席之中國委員會，作類似之演講，並引麥臯萊歷史論文內之語，以證實余言。麥氏論及歐洲在長期和平之後，因普魯士王腓力特烈之攘奪西里西亞，致引起「七年戰爭」，馴至擾及世界，以至「黑人戰於加羅門多之海濱，而紅人鬥於北美之湖旁」。</p>
<p>當此烽火籠罩世界之際，余前都不幸而中之言，今日述及，固無意味，但當時所論及之第二點，則又幸而言中；即謂日人之侵略，將鑄成統一中國之鐵錘。中國在災難之中，熱血之犧牲，與財政之毀失，雖屬不貲，但國家將因此而覓得其步入正軌之靈魂。此次自余抵美後，人每以之相詢都，即日本擁有名列第一等之陸海軍，並以大量之新式空軍，以酷愛和平之中國，既無可道之海空軍，陸軍配備，亦不完整，焉能與之相抗而自衛？今晚余將試爲解答，但無論吾人作何解釋，如將我國所克服之無窮困難，加以審察，則知眞正之答語，可於克林威爾之神秘語中求得之。克氏在痛苦之環境中曾云：「賴天地正氣，我輩雖力量薄弱，必能戰勝強暴都者」。</p>
<p>所幸者，中國當此危急存亡之秋，發現時勢需要之人物如蔣介石將軍其人；而民主國家在對抗希特勒，墨索里尼，近衛聯合之下，得有出類拔萃之領袖如邱吉爾，蔣介石，更有偉大之羅斯福總統爲其後盾，盡力援助，誠爲無上之幸運。一般人尋常每以爲蔣氏僅係名將，實則蔣氏兼爲現代之大政治家，對此鬭爭之意義與政治及實力之運用，皆有　確之認識。故對蔣氏之爲政治家，較其爲軍人更應重視，蓋蔣氏視戰爭爲達到目的之工具，與日本軍閥之觀點，固截然不同也。</p>
<p>茲請舉一例以明之：當戰爭初起時，中國軍艦在日軍機械化陸軍部隊與海軍之猛攻下，堅守上海者凡三月，第二個月終了時之情勢，顯然非有絕大犧牲，陣綫殆難堅守。當時德國軍事顧問與其同情於中國者，均勸中國軍隊及時撤退，但蔣氏因九國公約簽字國正在比京開會，擬設法停止中日衝突，故不顧此項意見，毅然下令各軍再堅守四星期。其時余正在上海，目擊我國兵士，因此所受之痛苦。我方陣綫有一弱瞇，日軍集中砲火炸彈全力猛攻，我方增援軍隊，師旅相繼，堅守該地陣綫。每師軍隊，第二日即傷亡達半，第二日須以他師替代，以血肉之軀，與砲彈相抗，其殺戮之慘酷，不堪設想。於此諸君即得一例證，即在軍事立塲上，縱應撤退陣綫，然因有更大之目的，故必繼續抵抗，論者或謂比京會議，完全失敗，最後一月，中國在上海之犧牲，毫無效用，但眞正政治家即在其寗受局部交戰之挫折，而救整個戰爭之勝利也。</p>
<p>日本於一九三七年開　時，趾高氣揚，近衛曾向外國記者及日本人民宣稱：三個月內，將擊敗中國，使之屈膝。以爲此戰之勝，將如今日所謂閃電戰，以最高之速度，作猛烈之攻擊，使中國不終朝而崩潰，今日者，日人對於戰局估計之錯誤，實已昭然顯者矣。吾人深知戰事時間延長，與我有利，日軍於戰時狀態之下，除其作戰之數百萬軍隊與數千只飛機外，尚須維持世界第一位之海軍。時間延長，終須竭厥，欲使中國民族發揚其偉大堅實之力量，須有充足之時間；欲使民主國家明瞭中國實爲自身及其他民主國家而戰，亦須相當時間，各民主國家有此覺悟，則將予中國以無限制的援助矣。</p>
<p>中國爲侵略之第一犧牲者，早已認定侵略行爲，倘加以容忍獎勵，則必引出無數之新侵略行動，馴至危及全世界之民主的生活。歐戰既起，其他各國始漸覺悟歐亞兩洲之戰爭，實爲民主與極權國家鬥爭之一體的各面。自一九四〇年九月二十七日日本正式加入德意同盟以後，人人始知中國之勝利，即爲民主國家之勝利，中國之失敗，亦即爲民主國家之失敗，中國業已達到延長戰爭目的，不但在三個月內之親電戰爭，無法實現，現在戰事延長，已三年有半，日本雯深陷於苦鬥之中，無法自拔。（未完）</p>

id="c55">第三五九期德國的戰時財政  周樹華　　希特勒統治下的德國對於戰事財政似乎並不感到有多大困難。我們並沒有聽到過他們有加稅，強制儲蓄或發行大量戰時公債這類的事。最近並且又廢除了一種重要的賦稅。德國的稅收截至一九四十年三月三十一日止在這財政年度內有著空前的成績；雖則數百萬的人民因加入軍役而不能生產，不會稅餉，但以這最近四月內的稅收而言，足證在本財政年度內一定有很好的成績。　　國民存在銀行中的儲金每月有更高的紀錄。德國公債的利率已自四釐半改爲四釐，而同時新發行的公債期限均自十年增爲二十年了，德國公債實際上很快地被民衆所吸收而並不用大事推銷的。因爲德國的錢實在太多了，這些事實是無庸否認的而是時常被納粹提出來大大地宣傳的。　　從一九三三年起，他們正在準備著全能戰爭，對於財政方面是也注意到的。德國較英國佔優勢的地方是在於德國第一次世界大戰時的債務上差不多已因一九二三年的通貨膨漲而全解決了。而英國則現在仍得支付公債的本息。因此英國的稅收能用在戰事上的就較德國差一些了。但是這最初的優勢現在已逐漸不存在了。因爲整頓軍備，德國已發行了大量的新公債。在一九一四年，德國的國債約在五十萬萬馬克以上（約合二萬五千萬英鎊）。在一九一八年已增至一千五百七十萬萬馬克（約合七十八萬五千萬英鎊）。在那時候，這是很可驚人的數字了。　　第一次世界大戰，德國的失敗並不是由於他財政的崩潰。當休戰時，德國國家銀行尚存有二十萬萬以上的金馬克，而德國在國外的投資約計至少有二百萬萬馬克。德國不得不請和的原因是在於軍事上的窮竭，大部份是由於長期嚴密的封鎖。　　但是在軍事失敗後割地賠款的重負至少債延長五六十年，因之德國對於戰後國得的取消實爲不容再緩的事了。德國祗能在這一個條件下才能渡過這個難關——即是有無限制的市塲能容納並吸收他那無數實業的出口物。無疑地，這次戰事的基本原因之一即是在於德國自一九一八年以來盡力地想開拓廣大的國外市塲以解決他的財政難關，而同時別國也因自己的戰債所迫不得不向這同一條路綫上去競爭。　　在希特勒未得勢之前，他就很知道雖則賠款已停止不付但是要解決德國的經濟問題，他認爲最要緊的是失業問題的解決，是需要無限制的市塲來容納德國的實業。有了市塲。失業問題就不復存在了。但是出口貨決不能突然地大增的。緊急的辦法祗好由政府「無限制」地自己定貨了。而重整軍備就是最合理的方法。至於德國的海陸空軍差不多全要從新整頓的，而所需要的似乎是沒有限額的。因此德國實業界所接受的百分之六十至七十的定單全是由於這重整軍備而來的。　　差不多有七百萬人又獲得了工作。這些人以前是賴政府的救濟而生活的。德國可以免付這筆巨款，因此預算平衡同時政府的稅收也增多了。原因是這些工人現在都能付稅了。這過程的重心當然是在於工資是由政府所支付的。祗有一小部所賺的錢流回來增多了稅收。所賺的錢並不是眞的經濟利潤。　　在先，希特勒對於進口的原料是不用過慮的，因爲全德國的廠家都有很多的存貨，因正值世界經濟不景氣，所以這些原料並沒有多大用處。據德國年報云，希特勒上台時，德國存有實業原料和半製成品不在二百萬萬馬克之下（或十萬萬英鎊）。希特勒也並不缺少廠具。在納粹集團未得勢之前，德國的實業已經完全上了軌道。而熱練的工人是很多的。所以大量的產物是正在等待開發。　　重振實業所需要的祗是（一）定貨和（二）款項。這二項都是能由政府無限制地供給的。定貨是全由重整軍備而來的。　　希特勒知道這樣浩在的工程是需要大量金錢的。這些金錢的來源是德國財政「奇蹟」之秘密而也解釋了德國戰時財政表面的成功。他們並不用專一的補救方法。所用的是千百種高明的計策祗是幾條基本原理之多種運用而已。　　希特勒認為費用是無限制地隨著生產而增多的。但是他這樣的做法卻將軍火的製造也當爲純經濟產物了。除非這些軍火能運銷出口的，即當然又作別論了。鑫儲存一些坦克車，飛機就多減少一些原料並多凍結了一些活動資本。假若要使這工作繼續下云的話除非不斷地能借得款項。　　當沙哈脫博士Dr　Schacht在任時曾極努力地擬整理短期借款。德國政府用獨占金融市塲和禁止私家發行的方法來強迫所有的儲蓄銀行，保險公司，信託社團，抵押及商業銀行等推銷短期庫券並認購政府的長期公債。這些庫券是是能貼現的所以和現金是差不多的。公債很快地就銷去，因爲政府的債券是最好的——至少在理論上——而且出息好。因此所有各勞工階級的積蓄，實業界銀行界和投資界所得的利潤及債券和抵押款項的利息均不斷地自動地幫助著德政府去重整軍備。賺到的錢就會流回去做這項工作。　　希特勒屢次主張有「增加和產」的必要，因爲這樣可以增加些稅收。工人被迫去做更長時間的工作。政府不斷地定了更精良的機器來增多產額。技術方面的研究是很著重的。農業方面都電機化了。　　因政黨的重稅和「工人陣綫」及「冬賑」的捐款使他們的生活程度實際上被弄得很低了。假若他們不會公然訴苦的話那是由於他們至少在希特勒統治下尚有工作可做。股息早已被固定爲六厘。超過此利率之上的利潤就必須投資在政府債券上。所以股東並享不到產額增多的利益。而爲預防和人不必要的靡費起見，在戰事發生前二年就無形地實行了按口援糧法。　　倘若希特勒在戰事初起時所說的話是眞的——他說重整軍備共費九百萬萬馬克，那末可顯示德政府截至一九三九年十一月底當共有債務九百五十萬萬刀克而在一九四〇年八月當在一千一百五十萬萬至一千二百萬萬之間，當然其他各州市鄉的債務亦須加上。　　據紀錄的德國債務——祗包括一小部份短期借款——在一九四〇年六月底爲五百五十二萬萬馬克。當希特勒上台時祗有一百十七萬萬馬克的債務。　　一九四〇年第二季起，德國國債每月平均約增二十七萬萬馬克。以前每月給增二十萬五千萬。在最初戰爭的十月內所發行的長短期債券總合二百十萬萬馬克。萊赫德部長Reinhardt最近宣示稅收祗能應付德國戰費的一半。因此德國的國債很快地將接過上次大戰期末的總數。最近德國並承認因另需舉債故不得不將債息自四厘半降低爲四厘云。　　在一個全能的國家內，和產祗是勉強存在的，利率能再降低，重稅能再征，債務能局部或全部加以取消，生活程度能因實行更嚴格的計口授糧制而更形降低；這方法是能繼續地實行一直到人民不能再容忍爲止。因此希特勒似乎不至於因財平衡點問題而失敗的。但是納粹的財政是建築在德國必勝的前提上，因爲他們可因得勝而要求巨額賠款並將自己的「破產」轉移給英國。　　希特勒必須假定德國必勝而戰事在短期內即可結束，所以他無庸若以往那樣地過慮到國債增高的問題。他想英國最後必然會無條件地投降的。目前他所應幹的任務是：（一）盡力應付一切國內的費用而並不致於實行通貨膨漲。（二）凡不得不進口的貨物當以現金或有價證券或出口貨物云抵付。究竟德國是用怎樣高明的方法一直實行到現在呢？德國是否能如此繼續下云直到戰事終止？在英國若實行同樣辦法能有同樣的效果否？　　假若說德國並沒有增稅的話，除了當宣戰時將所得稅加了百分之五十和煙酒等間接稅加了百分之二十外，理由是納粹的德國遠在戰事之前就將財政機構置於戰時的標準上而大事地加稅直至希特勒也認爲不可再加時爲止。　　假若德國在戰事發生後仍能增稅的話，那是由於因受較嚴格的限制而將消費額大量地減少的緣故。　　假若儲蓄銀行在存款仍能繼續增多的話，那理由是在更多的工作時間能有更多的進益，但因有用口的限制，消費並沒有增多。在德國，私藏財務是犯罪的，人民的積蓄必須存放在銀行裏。銀行的儲金增積起來之後就轉到政府的手中而換取了短期庫鄭或長期公債。而假若雖則很多工作人員加入了戰綫，儲金相反地在戰爭期內並不低落的話，那是由於大部份的工作已由婦女接代而在農田上則已大規模地利用肥料品並實行電機化了。　　推募虞事公債並不需要大事鼓動的原因是由於戰事發生後，公債的發行繼續不斷自動地經由儲蓄銀行，抵押銀行，商業銀行，保險公司及其他機關所銷納的。因爲在這些機關內是積有著很多的游資正在尋求投資的途徑。據最近的公報在本財政年度的第一季中四釐政府公債共發行了二十七萬五千萬馬克，而另有於十七萬五千萬馬克是以發行所謂「清理公債」（Li-Loans）而來的。這種公債大概是短期內要償付的。在三月之中共發行了四十五萬萬公債。　　德國戰爭的資源是全由於（一）生產的維持及增加；（二）因節制而減少消費；（三）一切不用的所得均自動地流歸政府。但是萊赫脫部長亦承認這數目雯不足以支付所有的戰費，並說捐稅祗能擔負費用的一半。這意思是說德國債務每年至少要增多二百五十萬萬馬克。　　戰爭加緊則這數目必然還會增高。萊赫脫在同一演詞中亦曾談及在三月之中德國曾舉債四十五萬萬馬克，這顯示德國短期債券一年必須增多發行七十萬萬全一百萬萬馬克。從另一報告上，我們得知德國在第一次世界大戰時，每月耗費爲二十萬萬馬克，現在每月戰費約爲四十萬萬馬克。這增多是全由於戰爭的機械化了。　　在一九三二年底紙幣發行額爲三十五萬萬，至一九四〇年八月底乃創空前紀錄，發行額增爲一百三十萬萬。從這點上，我們總覺得他是在通段膨漲。實際上通貨的增加，若包括角幣零鈔等等，則爲數更多了，在一九三二年底流通總數爲五十六萬萬；在一九三九年七月底爲一百二十萬萬馬克，現在　　的發行額不得而知，因爲角幣零鈔的數目不詳。但是德國還沒有感受到通貨膨漲嚴重的影響。假若　德國版圖的加大和生產的增多亦估計在內，那末紙幣發行額的增多亦未可認爲過度。因爲「價格的限制」。（“Price　stop”）是在警力之下嚴格地維持著的，所以無論如何通貨膨漲的影響是很不易發現的。　　以擴漲信用的方法來維持財政是不能無盡期地應用的。在一九三七年年底，信用的擴漲已達極點，當時生產已達最高額；工廠都在加工製造，並無失業的工人。現在德國國家銀行的總裁沙赫脫博士宣稱信用的擴漲是會停止的。希特勒也同意的。但是希氏知道除非國家能夠供給實業界「無限的市塲」（“Infinite　markets”——這就是說除非繼續努力重整軍備——失業問題，就會發生的。　　在財政方面，納粹　的德國目前不見得就會遭遇到困難。她最大的問題是在於能否維持原料的供給。計口授糧制是在戰事發生以前二年實行了。食糧及原料都早有儲存。他們是節儲了七年以上的物質來對付這次的大戰。　　爲減少進口貨起見，他們實行四年計劃，結果製造了多種綜合出品——織造的纖維，流質的燃料，人造的橡皮——並大量地應用替代品，例如將鋁質代替銅質。他們盡量種植農物直至——誇矜有好的收穫！——在目前計口授糧的戰時標準下德國百分之八十三的食糧是仰給於本國的。當戰事發動之後，食糧就限制到最低度。在戰事未發動的前二年就在冷藏室中儲存有大量的物品。因此假若收穫不佳也並不至於會再減低食糧的供給，但必然地不得不仰給預儲的食物了。　　德國不能輸出人家所需要的那些優越的特製品，例如，　件，因爲德國自己也需要牠的。她藉著信用很有條理地自鄰近各國輸入貨物，直至信用額滿了爲止。可能的話，她就用玩具，樂器，玻璃器具，磁器，瓦器，眼鏡，染料，藥品，及印刷等償付一切的輸入物。——這一切貨物所用的原料在本年國都有出產的。德國產煤極多，所以有多餘的話，她就將牠輸出。巴裘幹半島各國也不猶豫地主張請德國將他們的舊債加以整理。　　但是現在，正如一九三三年，一九一八年和一九一四年一樣，德國當前的問題是在如何發現新的市塲在自己的統轄之下足夠消納她輸出的工業品以償付一切進口貨的帳款並了結對別國的債務。　　譯自（The　Cjoma　Press,　January3rd　1941）　　（轉載「The　London　Times」）如是見聞　　四家美商銀行停辦美金支票戶。投機商　顯然，戰問何故？何故該問？此舉之作用，已在不言中。　　去年五月十三日本刊第三一九期「歐戰擴大與美滙前途」一文裏曾建議美國代管中日等在美資金，以遏阻投機。當初似乎夢想，現在已像正在實現中的理想了。　　去年十二月卅日本刊第三五二期「中日貨幣戰之今後」一文裏，曾預測中美貨幣合作的可能性；當初自覺尚嫌過於樂觀，現在變得勢在必行了。　　德蘇於前秋釋嫌言好，確屬驚人。然其言好的好法仍使希脫拉有東顧之憂，當初的驚人，實在犯不著。現傳蘇日經濟合作原則，已在莫斯科簽成協定，這又屬驚人的消息。然可驚的，這消息爲什麽會從西貢專出罷了？統制經濟談片  嚴懋德　　統制經濟的組織，即實統制經濟的機關，或謂經濟的參謀部此種本部組織的主體，是否應由原有的政府來組織，倘使此種本部組織根本可不必組織，那末新成立的組織應由新的力量來改組，授與原有政府對於產業界的活動，可知此種新成立的參謀本部，應視其所構成組織的方法與賦有權限來決定它的範圍，目標，程度等。而此種本部是以官吏，黨員等爲主體的，憂可說是資本家所有的，倘使以中產階級爲主體，同樣要改換面目，深知此種本部組織的本部，即知其此種組織將來的發展，不過各國組織的不同。各國各有其背景，當以政治而決定的，蘇聯的參謀本部的組織，有國際委員會，在德國有經濟委員會，在義大利有全國組合協議會，在英國有顧問委員會，這等等表示各國組織的不同所在。　　參謀部成立以後，在其工作方面，有數種顯明的目標：（一）如何謂和自由主義的經濟政治組織及民主政體政府的相互調和，從經濟上講，自由主義是以個人企業創制爲根據，因此政府應絕對自由答應個人企業的創制，然民主政體是絕對維護個人企業的創制，從十八世紀以來，一直是如此的。從近代企業發展的趨勢上講，集中企業是大於個人企業，在民主政體下，可不必反對此種制度，當然要密切注意如何引導個人企業向集中企業的路上去，這樣勢必要有一個新的組織來擔任不可，此非有經濟參謀部不可。（二）如何使專門科學應用到企業上，以增加其組織的力量，而此種組織的力量在前次大戰後更爲明顯。（三）如何使國家的利益與國家有衝突的利益比相調和，換言這，如何使國家與國家間相互衝突的利益調和。（四）如何使參謀本部成立　，希望經濟上陳舊的生產力去應用到　會幸福去，根據各國現行所採用的組織來看，與本組織所付的權力和組織的動機方法而論，各國所統制經濟成績不同的，所以其性質與方向亦不同。商業新聞經濟叢譚　鐘表漏刻  馮柳堂　　自鳴鐘流入中國，始於明代，明馮時可蓬窗讀錄曾云：　　「見西洋道人利瑪寶有自鳴鐘，僅如小香盒，一日十二時，凡十二次鳴，亦異物也。」　　可見當時鋒爲罕見之物。祟禎五年九月十五日月食，以欽天監與回回科及用西法（即利瑪寶等所傳之法）所推算之時刻不同，徐光啟疏陳所以不同述及定時法有云；　　「早晚定時之術，壺漏爲古法，輪鍾爲新法，然不若求端於日星，盡則用日，夜則任用一星，皆以儀器測取經緯度數，推算得之，此定時法也。」　　所云「輪鍾爲新法」，即自鳴鐘也。從日星以測時刻，恒星時也。　　何以謂之自鳴鐘，以其屆時自能擊鐘發音報時，不假人力，故曰自鳴，亦稱之爲時辰鐘。　　可是自動擊鐘報時，中國古代亦有之，始於唐僧一行梁令瓚等所製銅渾象儀，以漏水轉之，然未臻其妙。及宋太平興國四年巴中人張思訓創作以獻，太宗召匠造於禁中，踰年而成，置文明殿東鼓樓下。其制起樓高丈餘，機隱於內，規天矩地，下設地輪地足，又爲橫輪側輪斜輪，定身關·中關·小關，天柱七，直神左搖鈴，右扣鐘，中擊鼓。以定刻數，每一晝夜，周而復始。又以木爲十二神，各直一時。至其時，則自執辰牌，循環而出，隨刻數以定晝夜短長。……用開元遺法，運轉以水，至冬中凝凍遲澀，遂爲疎略，寒暑無準，以水銀代之，則無差失。舊制日月晝夜行度，皆人所運行，新制成於自然。尤爲精妙。惜乎張思訓死，即以失修而廢棄，法亦不傳。比中國各種製作，大抵如是，以人興廢，故迄無改善製作之機會。張思訓所製渾象儀，雖以木製，亦用輪軸，日月五星附麗於上，晝夜長短，寒暑進退，無所差忒與今之所謂天文鐘者原理用途，蓋如一轍。　　然在當時，鐘表猶爲稀世之物，即在清初尚如是，但觀康熙年間爲皇太后壽，清聖祖所獻之壽儀中，有自鳴鐘。康熙二十五年荷蘭貢品中，亦列有大自鳴鐘，所以清宮中僅多是各式的自鳴鐘，陳列一殿。正惟其爲外國進來之物，故在清初，猶限於貴族家中有之，不信，但看紅樓夢中記劉老老見鳳姐房中之自鳴鐘，鏜然作響，尚誤以怪物看待也。第六回書中有云：　　「劉老老只聽見咯噹的響聲，大有似乎打籮櫃篩麵的一般，不免東照西望的，忽見堂屋中柱子上，掛著一個匣子，底下又墜著秤錘般一物，卻不住的亂晃。劉老老心中想著，這是什麽東西，有甚用呢？正獃時，陡聽得噹一聲，又若金鐘銅磬一般，倒嚇了一跳，展眼接著又是一連八九下。」　　可見劉老老自稱爲「住在天子肢下」的，尚不識此物，其他可想而知。不但如劉老老，即清龍翔麟珠江奉使記，尚且見澳門之大自鳴鐘以爲奇特，其言云：　　「有定時臺，巨鐘覆其下，立飛仙臺隅，爲擊撞形，亦以機轉之。按時發響，起子末一聲，至午初十二聲，復起午末一聲，至子初十二聲，晝夜循環無少爽。前揭圓槃，晝十二辰，俟某時鐘動，則蟾蜍移指篤某位。」　　談到鐘，深覺紅樓夢中資料最多，可以見鐘之種類形式價值，如第十四回云：　　「鳳姐分派，寗府中人辦事的時候有云：「素日跟我的人，隨身俱有鐘表，不論大小事，皆有一定時刻，橫豎你們上房裏也有時辰鐘，卯正二刻，我來點卯，已正喫早飯，凡有領牌回事的人，只在午初二刻。」　　可見寗府上房裏有時辰鐘，而鳳姐不但自己有鐘表，隨身的僕婢亦都有鐘表，更比寗府中爲豪富了。在寶玉房中有一座檯鐘，如五十一回中寶玉問晴雯頭上可熱？　　「晴雯嗽了兩聲說道，不相干，那裏這麽嬌嫩起來了。說著，只聽外間房內格上自鳴鐘噹噹的兩響。」（未完）金雞納樹（續）  高劍農　　此後金雞納樹的名字，漸漸爲人注意，爲人所知。公元一七二七年，在赤道地方測量經綫長短的著名天文學家LaCondomine，在秘魯國親眼看見了金雞納樹；後來在十八世紀末，又有許多著名的學者商人，在南美洲遊歷或探險的，也見了這樹，作成報告。然一直到一八二〇年，纔有藥物學家Pelletier和Caventou，把金雞納霜的化學成分化騐提取出來，又有在阿爾日利亞的從軍醫生Maillot，不顧一切的反對，用它去治那個地方的熱病。自此以後，植物學家，化學家，對於金雞納樹問題的鑽研，纔熱烈的感覺有趣味了。　　人一切探隊的結果，知道這樹共包括六十多種，只生在北從委內瑞拉起，南到玻利維亞止的安達斯山東側面一條狹長的弓形地帶上，高度約自一千五百公尺到二千五百公尺，氣候有九個月豐富雨期和三個月相當的旱季。逢從金雞納樹皮的治瘧功效大彰以後，在這些高山地帶，便紛紛的雲集來許多採藥的土人或混血種：他們採藥是把周圍的金雞納樹，在離地一人高的地方，平空半腰的所下來！他們這樣的摧殘破壞，把金雞納樹弄的一天一天減多，而且有絕種的趨勢了。耶穌會的修士和一切該地的探險家，看出來，這事的危險性和嚴重性，於是纔有移殖和培養的計劃。公元一八五〇年，一個名叫Weddel的法國探險家，把金雞納樹的種子從玻利維亞帶到著名的「巴黎植物園」：印度和爪哇的最初幾棵金雞納樹，便是從巴黎植物園中分秧出來的。　　在南洋羣島的荷蘭人，經過二十年的奮鬥，到一八七〇年，纔把第一包金雞納樹皮運到本國去。可是現在這個出產。幾乎完全操在荷蘭人的手裏，他們在爪哇一島。就有一千萬模品質最優良的金雞納樹，年產「硫化幾寗」一千五百噸。然而就是這樣，我們離南洋咫尺的上海人，還要吃二三角錢一粒的，這實在應該如同麪包白水一樣的爲大衆日用必需口的小白丸！世界上那有眞心爲大衆謀幸福的生產家呢？……　　參考書：Coutiere著生物世界，Caustier著植物學，（完）車白回小四角　　昨糖市因星期日趨勢平平、二四粗白外棧期貨本月底打單八十元零六角至五角、下月十日打單八十元零八角、太古車白B嘜西棧八十元零八角、東棧八十元零四角、粘四角、HX嘜西棧七十九元、亦降四角、　　火柴肥皂漲風加厲　　火柴行情、漲勢甚勁、因原料發生恐慌、同業存底漸稀、臻價上騰不息、昨如美麗牌每箱五百七十五元、鳳凰牌每箱五百七十元、二等雜牌每箱五百十元、三等雜牌四百九十元、肥皂漲風亦頗健、因廠方派至同業、不敷市銷、致價連週高俏、刻市如固本皂每箱已售至三十一元五角、白祥茂皂二十七元五角、黃祥茂皂二十三元五角、剪刀皂二十四元五角、

<p>衣食住行食物療病雜談  王爵列　　食物是我們人體必需的東西，除補充人體內所消耗的物質，這可以幫助生長和發育，如同機器和機油一樣的有密切關係。　　食物不但有上面所說的功用，有好幾種疾病，的確也靠食物的力量，而獲得治　的結果。　　脚氣病是社會上很流行的一種疾病，這種疾病，大家都知道是缺乏維他命B而起的，那麽只要把缺乏的維他命B補充起來，疾病自然會好的。食物中的豆類訂棗等東西，包含極豐富的維他命B，患脚氣病者，可每日三餐時，多吃些這種東西，病魔就可以在無形中消失。尤其在上海所吃的大多數是西貢米，裹面的維他命B眞是缺少得很，我們健康者多吃些富於維他命B的豆類和紅棗等東西，也是預防脚氣病最好的辦法。　　牙齒出血或口膜流血等病症，橘子，蘋果，柑檸檬，等水菓，因爲含有維他　C的綠故，所以有特殊的治療效騐，俗說所謂淸火，不甚合理，牙齒口膜出血，是一種維他命C缺乏的徵候，水菓內的維他命C很多，所以才有這種功效，水菓最好吃生的，不可煮熟吃，維他命C得了高熱，是會完全散掉的．　　豬肝羊肝，雖屬普通食品，洽雀盲眼很好，雀盲眼就是晚間天黑時，視綫糢糊不淸，民間嘗用豬肝或羊肝，在飯鍋內烹熟，以保持原來的有效成分，許多雀盲眼患者常吃這種東西，錢視糢糊便慢傻的减少起來，日久就可以完全治好。雀盲眼病的起因，都是在其他疾病時，營養失調，缺乏維他命A的緣故，豬肝羊肝裏有很多的維他命A，治療的功效，當然是會有良好成績的。　　婦人懐孕流產，是一件最討厭的事情，遇到道種病態，可多吃牛肉，肝？蛋黃，萵苣等食品，就可以防患於未然的。婦人懐孕流產，雖然有許多原因，以維他命E缺乏爲最。以上幾種食物中，有豐富的維他命E，所以也有相當的功效了。　　牛乳是良好的滋養品，對腎臧炎性水腫，有　尿的功能，熱性病人的營養，牛乳居極重要的地位，因爲牛乳旣容易消化，而且沒有流弊的。中國婦女爲什麼沒有帽子  斯華　　中國婦女並不是絕對沒有帽子，古時的鳳冠，民初淸末時的包頭，現時偶然發見有鄉婦頭上的絨綫碗形帽；鳳冠除舊式婚禮裏的新婦還應用外，已祇能在戲齊上看到了，包頭和碗形帽或許仍爲老年婦女的恩物，年靑婦女，尤其是時代婦女，簡直已不屑一顧，所以一般地說來，中國婦女是缺乏帽子的。　　但中國婦女是不是需要帽子呢？這還極容易解答的，祇須看髮網和紮髮絲帶的流行，就能證明婦女頭上是需要一件實用而兼裝飾的東西，因爲沒有女帽，她們才模倣舶來影片裹所見，把髮網和絲帶權充一下，但這一種裝飾除避免頭髮散亂外，沒有保護頭部神經的功效，實際上萬萬及不到帽子，絲帶一物，更僅限於女孩和年靑婦女應用，中年婦女用它紮髮，即使絲帶的色澤不顯明，也見得不相配，所以婦女很需要有適當式樣和質料的帽子。　　我們知道外國婦女是有很多帽子的，穿禮服時的帽子雍容華貴；穿便服時的帽子輕逸大方；運動時的帽子更式樣繁多，類能與所穿衣服配合，具相得益彰之美。記得白雪公主影片裹七個矮人不是都有一頂很奇特的帽子嗎？這種式樣的帽子首先爲好萊塢女星採用，後來自加州流行至紐約，現在已成爲美國婦女最普遍的便帽了。　　不過這種女帽，如由穿短外套，短裙的女子戴着，極有風致，我們穿旗袍的，仍祇能望帽興嘆。　　時裝專家們決不會想不到女帽這件事，但在未有適富的，經過改良的女子服裝以前，女帽這件事就不會加以甚大的注意。女帽在中國絕對有其發展性，時裝專家大可以動些腦筋，發明以後，呈請專利，將來一帽風行，萬貫立致，而且女子服裝改革史上還有着創製者煊赫的名字呢！至於創製以後，如何使之風行，曾有人倡議廣吿妙策，謂祇須僱數百年靑婦女，頭戴帽子，徘徊於靜安寺路與霞飛路，必能使萬人注目，女子見了自會起效尤之心，逐漸推行，不難使女帽風行上海，上海服裝爲全國之表率，女帽到內地去，旣有其裝式實際二重功用，自會有廣泛的前途的。天廚食譜（四四）（七九）蛋捲包肉（倪古運擬稿）　　預備…鴨蛋　猪肉　冬筍　黑木耳　冬菇　凈　　白菱粉　味精　天廚醬油精液　鹽　糖　　料油　猪油　　製法…先將鴨蛋拷在碗內，用箸打勻成汁，再以生塊猪油，抹遍鐵鍋底，把蛋汁攤成直，徑七八英吋大小之圓形蛋皮若干張（攤蛋皮宜用文火）。復以猪肉，冬筍，冬菇（須先用沸水泡軟，去梗），木耳（亦先泡軟，揀除根脚），分別切成細末，併和一起調以適量之鹽，味精，醬油精液，白糖料酒等拌之，使成糊狀，但弗過稀。然後將製就之蛋皮平舖着，中聞敷以調就之肉糊，橫敷使勻，留出前端二吋許，捲之，用菱粉（先以冷水調好）漿，糊其合攏處，每一張製一捲，製好排置在粗盆中（每盆平舖五六捲，不可疊置），再隔水燉之，以熱爲度，熟後用刀切段，每段寸許長短，用以佐餐下酒，均極鮮潔可口。如在白鷄湯及白蹄胖湯中加鷄鴨血或粉皮作底，而以燉熟之蛋捲投入作羹，亦頗適口，其味較蛋餃爲佳。　　諸君…如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及油，鹽，醬，醋者，請撥電話「四四五九四」，當卽專差送奉，不取送力。一星期家常菜單  華英女士　　近來小菜塲上，有一種小塌窠菜，價格每斤不過六分，比大塌窠菜便實得多，幷且菜性軟糯，一煮就容易酥爛，眞所謂入口而化，倘用猪油淸炒，最爲相宜，如果和肉片或肉塊一同紅燒，尤其可口。就是素的做法，只須放多些油，也一樣的津津有味，愛好菜蔬的人，何妨一嘗試之。　　星期一　　肉片小塌菜　　紅燒捲心菜　　糖醋溜黃魚　　笋油拌豆腐　　星期二　　洋葱牛肉絲　　消燉小蝙魚　　蝦子炒麵筋　　蔴醬辣白菜　　星期三　　魷魚炒肉絲　　紅燒銅盆魚　　菠菜燒豆腐　　葱油蘿荀絲　　星期四　　芹菜牛肉片　　蝦米蛋花湯　　雪菜菉豆芽　　油菜炒綫粉　　星期五　　油豆腐嵌肉　　豆苗炒蝦仁　　紅燒蘿蔔片　　葱花豆辮沙　　星期六　　紅燒鷄冀膀　　鯽魚嵌肉餅　　蝦米膾乾絲　　紅燒索　景　　星期日　　肉燉醬　　煎帶魚　　黃豆芽　　金花菜喫辣茄之妙用  淸癯　　辣茄，從兩唯四川湖南等省人嗜之，江以南不能入口，此殆爲食性使然，今則各地多植有此物，而有非辣不易下嚥者有之矣。　　辣茄，以植物學言之，本爲一年生草，其枝幹宛似茄，而果亦如之，遂名之爲辣茄，實非茄也。淸明後下種，易於培壅，黃生長，高可二尺許，葉作繼圓形，而其端稍尖，末有長柄，係瓦生，治初夏，開白花，結實色靑，是時皮較嫩，味亦不辣，稱爲靑椒，初入市，價頗貴，切絲，和鷄片，或與肉絲炒之，頗可口，及色紅，性乃漸辣，而不喜嗜者，舉箸未沾脣，吐之不及矣。　　辣茄，亦可熬油，用刀切成細末，加以極微之鹽花，將竹筷拌勻，加以豆油，（此油，入冬不凍，故比之生油菜油蔴油，均勝之，並可久藏不變性），於文火上煎之，及沸，叫色鮮紅，異常姣艷；而辣質之成分悉融解其內，滴少許於素麵或腐花中，其味雋永無匹　　唯熬油之光，必須將辣茄之子去淨，特其子亦非無用，晒乾後，可磨成細末，則爲辣粉，投浸醬油中，又爲辣醬油，亦調味之良好物，或云辣茄性熱，不宜多食，不知此物之熱係擴散性，非沈降性，入肚易於發揮，故其功且能潤大陽而殺火，恒有患痔病者，食之乃瘳，此其明效焉；至能進食强胃，增加體溫，尤其次耳。　　辣茄之種類不一，有形如柿者，爲北地所產，厥性不辣，普涌者形俱略長，亦有如手指者或如筆頭與鷄爪者，則性極辣，小如櫻桃，而可作盆玩者，但供欣賞而已。間有結實向上，名朝天辣茄者，則觸手皮破，辣氣冲鼻，已不可嚮邇矣，若製成醬，亦極佳之原料，俗稱辣虎，各地醬園橧坊，一交冬令，均有出售，以供市銷，疏食妥羹，最經濟之輔佐品，舍此別無它物已。乘車科學  路透　　在都市中討生活的人們，乘車在日常生活中佔着一個很重要的地位，所以在整個的孤島上充塞了電車，汽車，公共汽車，脚踏車，人力車……，因此在報紙上。時常刊載着　於車子壓斃乘客而演出人命慘劇的消息這固然是駕駛者的疏忽，但一方面乘客確是缺乏乘車的科學智識，故生長在都市中的人們，對於這一點確有認識的必要。　　常我們有時從在動的電車中跳下來的一刹那，應向前後左右四顧一下，是必須的工作。這時我們的身體雖已離開了車輛，但不知道身子仍有傾向前去的某種速度，這是全世界鼎鼎人名的牛頓氏所發明的惰性法則，要是在那時我們再向前面跳去，那自然不會消滅那速度，反而是增加速度，於是有傾跌的危險，便不免有送人市虎之口而嗚呼哀哉的可能了。所以我們要向後跳，決不是向着軍輛進仃的前方，並且要注意如果身體上都還在動，而著地的脚已停止了；那終是有傾倒的危險，故當面朝看前方而左足向反一跳而下，依惰性所結與我們身體的速度可以消滅，我們身體着地，不致有强力傾倒的危險，像有經騐的賣票員或査票員往往以背朝着跳的一面向後跳下，這是可以得到兩重的便利，旣可使依惰性所賦予身體的速度减少，月可預防向後傾倒之虞。但我決不是提倡乘客的跳車，不過這是應當知道的一種技巧罷了。春塞斜峭</p>

<p>Canberra - Acting Prime Minister Fadden stated in a speech at Manlan Baona yesterday, "Australia now has a real possibility of being attacked," and also said, "Local defense against aggression will be carried out with a necessary attitude, the real issue has arrived, and all reasonable steps must be taken to deal with it." He also stated that Australia is willing to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries. It was announced that over the past thirteen months, the number of Australians who have joined the Royal Australian Air Force has reached 60,000. Furthermore, Australia's defense has been extended to Malaya, and elite Australian troops have landed there this week. Therefore, a special envoy will soon be dispatched to Singapore. (United Press, 22-23)</p>
<p>New York - Columbia Broadcasting Corporation announced that according to a broadcast from Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Sir Stewart denied that Australia had received any warnings from Japan. Sir Stewart also said that if Australia were to receive such warnings, we would certainly have a response. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - According to the Malayan Telegraph, the Australian troops who recently arrived in Malaya are now undergoing training with British and Indian troops under the command of the Northern Malaya Commander. The Commander warmly welcomed the Australian troops, saying that his British and Indian troops would do their utmost to cooperate with the Australian troops. The Australian troop commander stated that the style of combat training received in Malaya is different from that received in Australia, and he is confident that they will be able to undertake any defense work within a week. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Singapore - The head of the intelligence bureau, Pan, gave a broadcast speech last night, stating that if Malaya or its allies are attacked, Malaya will fight back. It is said, "We are not as hesitant or divided as Japan. We only know that if we or our allies are attacked, we will fight. Japan's so-called encirclement is a fallacy. Germany is well aware of Japan's predicament and is urging Japan to attack Britain and the Netherlands in the Far East, because what Germany wants is to divert the strength of these two countries." He also discussed civilian defense measures and said that small leaflets on air raid precautions have been printed in English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, describing how to deal with incendiary bombs. He advised the public to immediately prepare the necessary preventive equipment. He said, "We have been warned that when the crisis comes, we must keep our heads cool." Singapore is an extremely strong fortress, protected by artillery, troops, aircraft, and mines. Malaya also has countless British, Indian, and Australian troops defending it, so even if the greatest misfortune occurs, what worries do we have? In my view, the situation is very satisfactory. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Red Star newspaper wrote an article reviewing international current events, stating that British and American military preparations in the Pacific are very busy, and Japan is also actively taking military measures in Southeast Asia. Currently, the power struggle between the British-American group and Japan is unfolding in the Dutch East Indies. Japanese military authorities are eager to seize the oil, rubber, and tin resources of the Dutch East Indies. An American observer said that the measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Pacific not only help to defend the Dutch East Indies but also increase pressure on Japan, making it clear that if it advances south again, it will encounter a counterattack. The chairman of the Japan Metal Industry Association, Hirao, told reporters that if Britain and the United States impose economic sanctions on Japan, Japanese industry will suffer greatly. Currently, Japan's raw materials are largely dependent on overseas. Hirao strongly stated that Japan must improve this situation as soon as possible. Hirao's remarks fully illustrate that Japan's diplomatic actions are part of the ongoing "nerve war" between Japan and the United States. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>US Fleet to Remain Stationed in Honolulu</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned here last night that the current strategy of the US Navy is to keep the US fleet stationed around Honolulu instead of concentrating it in the Philippines. Senior naval circles revealed that the US Navy outpost may operate as far as Honolulu in the Far East, but the majority of the Navy will remain stationed around Honolulu. US naval experts believe that it is unwise to send the US fleet to the Philippines or Singapore to prevent Japanese action. It is generally felt that keeping the US fleet stationed in Honolulu to restrain Japan's deliberate actions against Singapore or the Dutch East Indies is a better situation than sending the US fleet to the South Pacific. According to experts, a Japanese naval attack on Singapore would make Japan and its fleet extremely vulnerable to enemy navies in the central Pacific. (International News Service, 23rd)</p>
<p>San Francisco - Thirty-six American fighter planes have been transported by the aircraft carrier "Enterprise" to Honolulu Harbor in Hawaii. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>New York - The latest poll on possible developments in the Far East shows that 56 percent favor the US trying to prevent Japan from seizing the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, 24 percent disapprove, and 20 percent have no opinion. Regarding whether the US should risk war to prevent Japan from seizing the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, 39 percent approve, 46 percent disapprove, and 15 percent have no opinion. Regarding whether the US should seek British consent to use naval bases in Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, 55 percent approve, 29 percent disapprove, and 16 percent have no opinion. The final question was "Do you think that if Japan seizes the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, US interests will be threatened?" 60 percent answered yes, and 20 percent each answered no or had no opinion.

<p>Webb - According to a report in the ABC newspaper from the Spanish capital, the United States is currently building a special type of warship. Although it is only 70 feet long, it is equipped with six torpedo tubes, six depth charge launchers, two anti-aircraft guns, and anti-shock equipment. According to experts, the speed and size of this warship can avoid air attacks. It is said that this ship can increase its speed from eight knots to forty knots in eight seconds and decrease its speed from thirty knots to three knots in three seconds. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>New York - The "New York Herald Tribune" reported yesterday that President Roosevelt will issue an order in the next few days to expand the scope of the export permit system.

<p>Chongqing - Military News: Japanese troops who were annihilated by Chinese troops in Tuo County, northwest of Chao County, on the 8th, took advantage of the snowy night to break through. They fled to Hezihe, west of Tuo County, and were reinforced from east of Hefei on the 19th, launching another fierce counterattack on Tuo County. After Chinese troops fought bravely to resist, engaging in fierce fighting for more than four hours, they finally defeated the Japanese. The remaining Japanese fled in different directions to the west. At the same time, another unit of Chinese troops captured Qingxi Town, east of Chao County. Another unit of Chinese troops shelled Dianbu, east of Hefei, destroying many Japanese barracks and warehouses. In this battle, a total of more than 700 Japanese were killed, and five artillery pieces, rifles, and many other military supplies were captured. On the 17th night, Chinese troops attacked the Japanese at Lengjiaji on the Yuehan Railway, killing many Japanese and destroying a Japanese engineering vehicle. They also laid landmines nearby. On the morning of the 18th, a train of Japanese troops passed by and detonated the landmine, destroying three cars and causing heavy Japanese losses. The Japanese troops near Zhancai have been constantly attacked by the Chinese army and have mostly retreated into the city. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese in the area around Nanbo Mountain. A unit of Japanese troops from Yangcheng, with three artillery pieces, advanced towards Dongfan. They were repelled by Chinese troops, and more than 100 Japanese were killed. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Eastern Jiangxi - The Japanese troops near Pengze in Eastern Jiangxi crossed Taibo Lake at dawn on the 20th, attempting to advance towards Wanjiazui. Chinese troops took advantage of the Japanese troops being halfway across the lake to launch a surprise attack, sinking four Japanese ships. The Japanese were unable to hold out and retreated.

<p>Chongqing - Various Chinese circles here hope that Communist Party leaders will carefully consider allowing Communist Party representatives to attend future meetings of the People's Political Council so that they can continue to participate in future meetings and discuss major national issues. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Whether the Communist troops will obey orders in the future is a matter of great concern to officials here.

<h3 id="e8">How to Take the Initiative in the International Crisis <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>In the current complicated and dangerous international situation, the most difficult thing is the inability to grasp the focus of the development of the situation, which increases the infinite confusion and anxiety about the future. Regarding the current situation, the most concerning situation for the world recently is in the Pacific, which is also where various democratic countries have been focusing their vigilance recently. However, the Pacific issue is obviously not an independent category, and at least half of the key to its evolution lies in the trends of the European situation. To further discuss the European situation, in the past three months, the war has only developed on both sides of the Mediterranean Sea. Recent events such as the turmoil in the Balkans and Eden and Dill's visit to Egypt indicate that that corner is attracting the great attention of both warring parties. However, if the Axis powers are indeed preparing to launch an offensive against Britain in the near future, they may not choose the Balkans, which is a complex situation and lacks a decisive effect on the overall situation, as the most advantageous target. As for the Axis' future strategy against Britain, it is still a question of how to choose and use the paths of strict submarine blockade, large-scale sea landings, and expanded air strikes. Moreover, among all the possible strategies, it is difficult to make a hasty judgment as to whether the Axis will concentrate its efforts on one and only one single offensive, or will it operate both concurrently and take care of multiple aspects. What's more, nerve warfare and smoke screen tactics are tricks commonly used by today's aggressors, which inevitably add to the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Compared with the preparedness of democratic countries at this time a year ago, everything is obviously progressing rapidly. Although the arrangements in all aspects may not be as ideal as seamless perfection, the opportunities available for aggressors to exploit have indeed been gradually shrinking. Even in the past, except for China's brave resistance, the Far East, which was completely unprepared, has also been greatly enhanced due to the unprecedented active vigilance and increased defense of Britain and the United States, gradually reaching a state of not fearing aggression and provocation. This is certainly the result of past painful lessons, and it is something that people around the world who sympathize with democratic countries are gratified about. However, aggressors who are good at exploiting general human psychology will probably not rashly launch an attack when the other party is on high alert without absolute certainty. On the contrary, they will create various doubts and disguises to confuse people, and then take advantage of the other party's slackening of vigilance and exhaustion to launch a surprise attack. Looking at the past, the Nazi leader was the most skilled person in this type of strategy, and the Japanese are also imitating him step by step. The extreme chaos of the current European situation and the superficial relaxation of the Pacific situation are both due to the application of this strategy by the aggressor front. They still maintain the initiative and the situation, which can be proved by the existence of the term "Spring Offensive," and it is also the main reason why the world is difficult to grasp the future of the situation. In the democratic countries, although their current defense lines have expanded to almost half of the world, and although the British army's offensive in North Africa, the Middle East, and other places has achieved significant success, from an overall perspective, it has only exerted the qualities of a defensive posture.</p>
<p>In terms of military principles, offense is the main action of war, and offensive is the main form of war. In other words, giving play to the meaning of war and completing the mission of war must at least be tied to an offensive in the final stage of the war. As for defense, it is either a strategy in the middle of the war process or a step before reaching the final stage. To further analyze, in addition to using the offensive in the final stage to determine victory, it is often necessary to adopt an offensive as much as possible in other stages in order to easily maintain the strategic initiative or strive for the initiative, which is to grasp the advantage. Although the advantage depends on strength, it also depends on the offensive and defensive strategies. The initiative is the ability to freely exert intelligence and freely control power to choose the most favorable timing, goals, and actions for oneself. Based on the above-mentioned reasons, we can understand from its opposite side how unfavorable it is to be stuck in a defensive posture in war. If the other party is quiet, they will be worried and on guard in many ways. If the other party moves, they will be eager to respond and exhausted in running around. In short, they will be in trouble. The disastrous defeat of the Anglo-French allied forces last spring, in addition to the reasons for the strength of the troops and the war equipment, the strategy of Gamelin's stubborn defense of the Maginot Line should bear a major responsibility. Furthermore, in the Sino-Japanese War, China had to use the strategy of exchanging space for time because of the disparity in strength, but it never stuck to it. In the past three and a half years, none of the battles with significant achievements was due to the strategy of mobile warfare, which is also a flexible combination of offense and defense. As for the current international war situation, the trend of the rise and fall of the strength of both sides is certainly the strengthening of the democratic countries and the weakening of the aggressors. However, until now, the initiative of the Axis front cannot be broken simply by applying pressure and trapping them, and its confusing and uncertain future offensive is still a pressure that the democratic countries and people with a sense of justice around the world feel both spiritually and practically. Because of this, it must be admitted that more and better weapons of nerve warfare fall into their hands. Not only can the world's vision be disturbed to dazzle, but even the great powers may be troubled by them at times. If they are not careful, they can easily be deceived by the tricks of attacking in the east and striking in the west. Therefore, those who are currently tasked with stopping aggression, in addition to striving to increase their strength and intensify their vigilance, should also quickly and actively plan to obtain the initiative. Time belongs to the democratic countries, and victory belongs to the democratic countries, but if they do not take the initiative early, the space gained by the aggressors through continuous expansion will be enough to reduce or even offset the value of time for the democratic countries. Victory is an absolute belief, but procrastination is the insidious enemy of the victors!</p>
<p>The democratic countries have already accepted the challenge of the aggressors and entered a state of total war. The aggressors' actions are no longer tentative peeks, nor are they local and accidental launches. Therefore, it is not enough to simply repel the invasions they have already launched; it is not enough to simply prevent and contain the offensives they are planning. How can surgery only apply antiseptic agents and allow the existence of ulcers? How can one be satisfied with temporarily slowing down the progress of the ulcers? We must fundamentally eliminate all the harmful status quo and sources in order to ensure world order, ensure human peace, and promote civilization and increase well-being.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Solution to Thai-Vietnamese Dispute Rejected by Vichy Government: Vietnam's Strategic Military Location Could Influence the Entire Situation; Ceding 40,000 Square Miles of Land Is Too Great a Loss; De Gaulle Opposes Being Forced to Abandon Any Territory <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: Authoritative authorities here today stated that the French government rejected the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border war, which was sent from Vichy yesterday afternoon. It is claimed that the Tokyo mediator's plan sacrifices a quarter of French Cambodia. The cabinet met on Friday to study it, deeply feeling that France could not accept it, and decided to reject it. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: The cabinet held a state affairs meeting yesterday, spending most of the time reviewing the situation in the Far East, especially the situation in Vietnam. The reason is that Vietnam's geographical location is at the intersection of the defense lines of various countries. Therefore, if a conflict occurs in the Far East in the future, Vietnam will undoubtedly be the center of the conflict. The British Far East defense line starts from the upper reaches of the Mekong River, that is, the border between Myanmar, Yunnan, Vietnam's Tonkin, and Thailand, and extends to the American Samoa Islands. The Commonwealth of Australia and India are the population centers of this defense line, and Hong Kong is the outpost of the defense line. This line is partly on land and partly at sea, stretching for thousands of miles like a rainbow. One of the most important sections is northeast of Singapore. The analysis is as follows: (1) The north side of the port is the Burmese border, where 40,000 troops have been concentrated to protect the road to India, which is the famous Burma Road. As for the military status of Singapore itself, the port is already very strategically important in terms of terrain, and it has been further strengthened by the British construction of strong defensive works. The troop strength stationed there in peacetime is only 50,000, but now some Australian troops have been dispatched to reinforce the defense, and the air force strength of the port also has 1,200 aircraft. (2) Southeast of Singapore is the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands was an ally of the United Kingdom in the current European war and had fought against Germany side by side. In the Far East, it can also provide significant assistance to the United Kingdom. Although the number of troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies is small, they are well-trained and have strong combat effectiveness. Its naval strength should not be underestimated. Surabaya in Java is an ideal naval base, especially for submarines. Under these circumstances, in order to counter the United Kingdom's intensification of its strength in the Far East, Japan had to dispatch a large number of army and navy troops to Southeast Asia. According to British sources, Japan currently has four divisions stationed in Taiwan, because Taiwan is the bridge between Japan's mainland and Hainan Island and Tokyo, which is easy to praise and run. At times, the military is cruising in the sea. In the United States, the strength of the garrison on the Philippine Islands has been greatly enhanced, and the number of military successors belonging to the Asian team has also increased. The above is a glimpse of the military deployment of the major powers in the Far East today. Vietnam is among them, and its position is very subtle. This is why the French Council of State must conduct a thorough review. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: Representatives from France, Japan, and Thailand have been negotiating in Tokyo for many days. The Thai representative recently revealed the content of the country's demands on Vietnam, which is that Thailand demands to obtain the territory on the left bank of the Mekong River, which is unacceptable to the French side. The Japanese representative then proposed a compromise plan, advocating that Thailand obtains the following areas: (1) The bag-shaped area formed by northern Thailand and the right bank of the Mekong River; (2) The Pakse area on the right bank of the Mekong River; (3) Parts of Laos and Cambodia, that is, areas under the jurisdiction of Vietnam since 1907, with a total area of 40,000 square miles. After carefully studying this compromise plan, the French government believes that further negotiations are still needed. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: After Lieutenant General Decoux, Governor-General of French Vietnam, convened the highest military conference in Saigon, there was much speculation about Vietnam's future attitude and position in the Far East crisis. Well-informed sources here recently stated that France has the responsibility to protect the integrity of its administration and sovereignty over its Far East colonies and its colonies elsewhere in the empire. In other words, if the French colonies are subject to foreign aggression, France should defend them. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: General de Gaulle, leader of Free France and head of the French Territory National Defense Council, recently published an article saying that the temporary disaster encountered by France should not be a reason for other countries to undermine France's territorial integrity or France's rights around the world. Any abandonment of French territory forced by the Vichy government or its representatives will be regarded as invalid by the National Defense Council. The above statement was issued in response to the Vietnam incident, and it stated that the French Territory National Defense Council does not despise agreements that reconcile the interests of Vietnam and other countries, but any transfer of rights obtained by force or threat undermines the land or political position of Vietnam when the armistice agreement of June 23, 1940, was implemented. Free France can never be regarded as reasonable. The National Defense Council now declares that it approves of Vietnam's attitude against this kind of invasion. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable sources today said that the French cruiser "Barima Ki" and two submarines recently arrived in French Vietnam from North Africa. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Hanoi. Semi-official sources said that the French side in Vietnam is now preparing for war. Vietnamese Governor Decoux has issued orders to local officials in Tokyo, stating that in view of the impending danger, they must prepare to deal with all possible incidents. All strong men are ordered to prepare for possible mobilization of civilian defense, and report the existing storage of food and agricultural products. It has been reported that all are being sent to a certain base near Saigon. It is also reported that French military supplies are being rushed from Haiphong to Hanoi every day.

<p>Chongqing: The spokesperson of the Military Council made a statement, and the important battle situation in the past week (February 16th to 22nd) is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Hunan-Hubei Area</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in southern Hunan Province invaded south along the Xin-Ying Highway and were ambushed by the Chinese army near Chongjingchong, suffering heavy casualties and capturing five prisoners. The outposts around Luoshan have all fallen into the hands of the Chinese army, and the Chinese army is stepping up its siege. The troops under Liang Mingxing and others from the reserve army in northern Henan Province came over to surrender near Bo'ai, and the Chinese army has fully resettled them. On the morning of the 19th, the Chinese artillery near Yichang bombed the Japanese airfield and destroyed three Japanese planes. The Japanese troops in the area of Cenhekou east of Shashi have been reinforced for days, and they have launched fierce attacks on Dongshi and Panzhangqiao south of Cenhekou on the 17th and 18th under the cover of aircraft and artillery. On the morning of the 19th, the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack, killing more than 500 Japanese cavalry (Hayasaka) and others. On the night of the 15th, the Japanese troops in the area of Chenxi, Tantan, and Henglinkou were defeated by a fierce attack by the Chinese army. On the night of the 16th, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Qianjiang, under the cover of aircraft, invaded Huafengkou from Shangxinti, Shahe, and Xiantaozhen. They were intercepted by the Chinese army. One part of more than 1,600 troops was cut off by the Chinese army at Beikou south of Mianyang and was attacked from both sides, killing more than 300. One part was attacked by the Chinese army at Wenhekou (north of Xinti), suffering heavy casualties. The Chinese army is now fiercely annihilating them separately. On the evening of the 18th, the Chinese army simultaneously attacked the Japanese troops in Tongcheng, Xishan, Jingshan, Daheping, and Baishazui, capturing a lot.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Fujian Area</p>
<p>Since the 10th, the Japanese troops in Guangdong Province, with a force of more than 5,000, attached to 12 mountain cannons and 2 heavy cannons, under the cover of 6 aircraft, invaded along the 43rd Highway and the Luxi Highway. One route detoured from Xinjie obliquely out of Chini and Baini towards Guotaiwei, entering Datang, seemingly to seize the materials of Lubao. The Chinese army intercepted them separately from Daqutoutou south of Yangmei, and lured them into Lubao and the suburbs, taking advantage of the favorable terrain to counterattack. On the night of the 11th, the Chinese army killed more than 1,000 Japanese troops. Those who entered the city were completely annihilated by the Chinese army. Another part of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops entering Datang from the flank, and the Japanese troops suffered even heavier losses. The Chinese army also captured more than 100 war horses and many other military supplies. On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese troops who invaded Pingdiwei from Shenzhen were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and fled towards Henggang.

<p>Tianjin: The Chinese police in the French Concession here have resumed their original state this evening after a five-hour strike. It is reported that they made a request to the French Bureau of Works and it has been accepted.

<p>Tianjin: The Chinese police in the French Concession here suddenly went on strike. At noon today, all the police gathered at the police station. After lining up for inspection and leaving the police station, they did not go to their posts. Those who were originally on duty also left their posts. There was no news beforehand. The French Bureau of Works was quite surprised because the police officers' reports were not bad. The matter is now being investigated. The strikers gathered at a certain branch police station in the French Concession, and their speeches were quite激烈. It was reported to the Reuters interviewer that they demanded a written guarantee to dismiss several police officers, including three of French nationality. In addition, they requested longer rest periods and increased monthly salaries. According to French Police Chief Edan Hsieh's words to the Reuters interviewer, the requests made by these people are the same as those made by the Chinese police in the British Concession who went on strike last autumn.

<h3 id="e17">Balkan Situation Chaotic; Rumors of Soviet Warning to Germany: If Bulgaria Is Invaded, the Economic Treaty Will Be Abandoned; Soviet Union Denies Facilitating Turkish-Bulgarian Agreement <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Capital of Bulgaria: Reliable neutral sources state that if Greece refuses to make peace with Italy, a general offensive in the Balkans from the air, land, and sea is only a matter of time. Semi-official newspapers are now urging the people of Bulgaria to remain calm. Reliably informed sources close to the government claim that the Soviet ambassador to Germany has notified the German government that if German troops cross into Bulgaria, the Soviet Union will not fulfill the German-Soviet economic agreement signed on January 10. Also, according to unconfirmed Turkish sources, the Turkish government will go to war against Germany if German troops invade the Balkans, but only a defensive war, so that the British fleet can pass through the Dardanelles and cut off the Soviet oil supply line to Germany. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Foreign diplomatic circles with access to information said this morning that the Soviet Union is trying to persuade Germany to delay Bulgaria, so the tense situation in the Balkans has greatly eased. Diplomatic circles believe that Bulgaria will resist any German attempt to invade. (International News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Swiss newspaper "Basler Nachrichten" published an article stating that "the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement was facilitated by the assistance of the Soviet Union." TASS recently declared with official authorization that this report is completely inconsistent with the facts. (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Capital of Turkey: The British newspapers expressed disappointment with the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty, and responsible people here were very surprised by this, saying that this agreement cannot be regarded as a German victory, nor can it be called a British failure. Its sole purpose is to enable Turkey and Bulgaria to stay out of the war when their own major interests are not infringed. That's all. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Panic Among Bulgarians; British to Evacuate Women and Children from Bulgaria</p>
<p>Capital of Bulgaria: Bulgaria is now awaiting developments. Although it appears calm on the surface, anti-aircraft guns have now been installed on the roof of the National Bank, which also shows the panic of the people. According to British observers here, Bulgaria will soon be occupied by Germany. Germany has now openly expressed anxiety about Italy's fate in Albania and believes that Bulgarian land can open a convenient door. Germany is handling the Greek issue. The rumor that pro-British suspects were arrested in Bulgaria yesterday has not been confirmed, but it is true that about 30 people have been detained by the police for unknown reasons. Bulgarian officials still deny that Germany will occupy Bulgaria, and rumors such as bridging the Danube have also been rejected. However, the people are worried about the future. According to recent news from the outside, German-erected signposts have been found on the road, but responsible parties here have not been able to confirm the news of riots in various provinces. Bulgarian newspapers widely published German reports that Greece's position is in danger and said that Germany no longer considers the Albanian war as a separate conflict between Italy and Greece. According to observers, Germany will use the landing of British troops in Thessaloniki as a reason for German troops to enter Bulgaria. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The Daily Mail reported that General List, commander of the German forward headquarters, and his staff have arrived in the village of Camkolia, 50 miles from Bulgaria. German troops have completely taken over the village. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Capital of Bulgaria: It has been officially announced that British women and children residing in Bulgaria will leave next Monday, and various cultural institutions run by the British here have already automatically closed. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Rumor that Germany Made Three Demands; South Country's Troops Moved to the Border</p>
<p>Zurich: Authoritative sources say that German leader Hitler has demanded that the South Country remain strictly neutral in the event of any events in Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. It is claimed that Germany has asked the South Country to agree to a partial demobilization of the South Country's troops and to allow the following concessions: (1) Allow Germany to transport troops and military supplies through the country; (2) Allow Germany to build an air force base in South Chirbia near Albania; (3) Join the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance or recognize the European "New Order." According to interpretations here, the presentation of this condition is Germany's final preparation to gain a base and launch the Balkan offensive that is expected to take place. Therefore, it is the consensus that Germany will never begin attacking Greece unless the South Country meets the conditions and fully joins Germany. (International News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: It is widely believed here that Germany is still preparing to advance into Bulgaria in two ways. There is still troop movement in both the Romanian and Bulgarian borders, with troops in Romania moving towards the border. Based on current observations, there will be developments soon. Germany seems to be preparing a major propaganda campaign in addition to military action in order to cause concern among the Balkan countries. At the same time, German newspapers are exaggerating the opportunity to invade Britain, saying that submarine warfare will definitely defeat Britain, and aerial attacks can also achieve a lot. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Eastern City of Yugoslavia: Political circles here predict that the people of the South Country will react seriously to the news that Germany is building a bridge over the Danube, because the people of the South Country are quite enthusiastic in their opposition to the Nazis. The government of the South Country will definitely issue a statement of explanation to appease the situation. According to political observers, the announcement of the German bridge-building across the river is definitely related to the reaction to the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration. Both here and in Bulgaria, the general opinion is that the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration is a result of Soviet influence, and its purpose is to prevent Germany from invading the Balkans.

<p>Diplomatic War Between Britain and Germany Intensifies; Eden to Go to Greece and Turkey from Egypt</p>
<p>Capital of Hungary: The joint visit of British Foreign Secretary Eden and Army Chief of Staff General Dill to the Middle East and Near East has already aroused significant attention here. According to various sources, Eden's future itinerary is planned to be from Egypt to Greece, and then to Turkey. Diplomatic circles here said that after Bulgaria and Turkey established a non-aggression treaty, the British side may believe that only unlimited aid to Greece can maintain its strong position in the Balkan Peninsula. In other words, the purpose of British diplomacy is to urge Turkey to remain faithful to its obligations in the Balkan Peninsula, so that it can have a countervailing effect on the Turkish-Bulgarian mutual non-aggression treaty. On the other hand, German diplomacy seems to have obtained the tacit consent of the Soviet Union in promoting the reconciliation between Turkey and Bulgaria this time. Therefore, it has created an atmosphere conducive to the peaceful resolution of various issues in the Balkan Peninsula. It is expected that Germany will speak to the Turkish government, explaining that it is beneficial for Turkey not to interfere in the Italian-Greek war. If this is not the case, the result will inevitably cause a major reaction throughout the Balkan Peninsula. Furthermore, Germany may point out to Turkey that, legally speaking, Article 4 of the British-Turkish mutual assistance treaty stipulates that when there is a need to resolve various issues related to maintaining the status quo in the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey has the need to cooperate with the Soviet Union. Therefore, Turkey can cite this provision to refuse to interfere in the Italian-Greek war. The diplomatic war between Britain and Germany has now become more and more intense. Although Germany has won an initial victory, there will be major developments in the next few days. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy: Political commentators here said that although the Soviet Union and the Turkish authorities have made statements regarding the friendly declaration issued by Turkey and Bulgaria, the political situation in the Balkans is still very chaotic. The only certainty is that the Soviet Union has greatly benefited from this, because the Soviet Union has had very close relations with Turkey and Bulgaria for many years, and has long wanted to win over these countries. Although the Soviet authorities deny participating in the negotiations of these countries this time, the friendly declarations issued by these countries are in line with the political goals of the Soviet Union. In this way, the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans has become more substantial, and anyone who is in an antagonistic position with it will not be able to extend into the Black Sea. As for the statement issued by the Turkish authorities, although it said that the country's treaty obligations have not changed, the country's authorities seem to have the intention of reserving freedom of action. The country's chances of participating in this war will naturally be less than a few weeks ago. Although there are many alarming news on the border between Bulgaria and Romania, major military actions will not occur in the short term because the snow on the Balkan mountains has not melted. If other countries in the Balkan Peninsula are involved in the whirlpool of war in the future, the question of Turkey's participation in the war will naturally be expedited.

<p>Moscow - Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and Navy. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded various medals to 1,883 Red Army officers and soldiers to recognize their achievements in implementing orders and training. At the same time, the People's Committee also conferred honorary titles on meritorious Red Army generals. Army Commander of the 2nd Rank, Chaiberu Chaizhi, was awarded the honorary title of Army Commander of the 1st Rank, and Aiboshengge and Pavlov were awarded the honorary title of Lieutenant General, while Jipangzhi Gusnazuo and Chiliweizhengguo were awarded the honorary title of Major General, and Yekefu Lengfu was awarded the honorary title of Artillery Major General. Furthermore, Marshal Timoshenko, the Soviet Defense Commissar, recently awarded the "Excellent Service" medal to 3,549 Red Army officers and soldiers to commend their achievements in military and political training. (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - Marshal Timoshenko, the People's Commissar for Defense Personnel, issued the following statement: "This anniversary of the Red Army's founding comes at a time of the most complex international situation. Countries are gradually being engulfed in flames. The Soviet Union, relying on its own economic and defense strength and the political unity of its people, strictly adheres to Stalin's wise neutral foreign policy. This policy has given us new victories in the past year. The Soviet nation has been strengthened, and the borders have been consolidated (especially the northwestern border around Leningrad. Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have become Soviet territories, and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have joined the Soviet nation). The Red Army possesses new weapons and capable officers. Thanks to the concern of Stalin, the Party, the government, and the entire people, the Soviet Red Army has become a great force. However, we must never be complacent and must continue to strive for new achievements. In modern warfare, all officers and soldiers should possess the spirit of enduring hardship and sacrifice. Discipline, decisiveness, and perseverance are essential for our Red Army to continue to strengthen itself and safeguard the peaceful labor of the Soviet people." (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - Admiral Gusnazuo, the People's Commissar for the Soviet Navy, issued a statement saying, "In the past twenty-three years, the Red Army and Navy have been closely monitoring the borders. The past year has been a year of victory for us, and the naval power has also greatly increased. Modern warships continue to increase, and the Soviet maritime warship manufacturing program has been successfully implemented. The security of the maritime borders of the socialist country is guaranteed. The Soviet fleet has also made many achievements in war training. However, we must not feel complacent about our current achievements. The Soviet naval power must continue to strengthen itself. In the current complex international situation, our navy should be well prepared so that the enemy's unexpected incidents and conspiracies cannot succeed. Naval training should closely resemble wartime operations. Soviet industry will surely achieve new achievements in the implementation of the resolutions of the 18th Communist Party Congress. In other words, in the near future, we will surely obtain sharper weapons. On the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and Navy, I would like to extend my congratulations to everyone." (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Vichy - British and German aircraft formations were very active yesterday and today, bombing each other's territory. British aircraft soared over various ports along the French to Norwegian coasts throughout the day, successively dropping bombs on Brest, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, Saint-Léger, and Helder in the Netherlands. German oil depots outside Bergen, Norway, were also hit by British bombs. At the same time, the British Air Force also assisted in the fighting on the Albanian and Libyan fronts, bombing Berat and Tepelene in Albania, and German air force bases on the Italian island of Sicily in the Mediterranean. As for the German aircraft formations, they continued to attack the British mainland, especially targeting coastal merchant ships. The British ship "Sea Goose" has been attacked three times, with one ship sunk and two heavily damaged. In addition, both sides' navies are also very active. In addition to the British fleet laying mines in the Mediterranean, that is, the sea around Italy, German fleets have appeared in the Indian Ocean, sinking the British merchant ship "Canadian Cruiser." This shows that German ships are very active in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and even the South Atlantic. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>London - A British Air Ministry bulletin stated that yesterday British and German aircraft patrolled the skies near the southeast coast, with considerable activity. One enemy fighter plane was shot down, and bombs fell in areas such as East Kent, causing very minor damage. It is now known that on Friday night, British anti-aircraft artillery destroyed an enemy bomber, and another enemy bomber was destroyed near the Bristol Channel yesterday afternoon.

<p>Algeciras - According to information received here, two aircraft of unknown nationality appeared over Gibraltar yesterday between noon and 1:00 PM. British anti-aircraft batteries fired at them, but without success. One of the aircraft had three engines. Both aircraft flew towards Morocco. Yesterday morning, five cargo ships, fully loaded with war materiel, were escorted to Gibraltar by several warships. Another submarine left after repairs, and a destroyer, heavily damaged, has entered the port for repairs. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to news from here, in the past 24 hours, German aircraft continued to conduct maritime bombing raids, sinking three merchant ships totaling 18,000 tons, and heavily damaging two armored ships totaling 8,000 tons, and sinking one merchant ship of 4,350 tons. However, the location of the bombed ships was not specified. German long-range bombers sank a 7,000-ton merchant ship off the northwest coast of Scotland yesterday morning, and heavily damaged two 5,000-ton ships. Another group of German aircraft heavily bombed Swansea and Wales, dropping 51 tons of bombs and 578 incendiary bombs. Only two German aircraft were lost in the aftermath. According to news released by the German News Agency, British aircraft attempted to raid German territory but were forced away by German aircraft without engaging in aerial combat, so there were no losses. The German High Command stated that British aircraft carried out "disruptive" air raids on the German coast on Friday night. Except for one bomb that hit a building and started a fire, the rest fell into the sea. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London - Since the fierce aerial combat between Britain and Germany in August and September of last year, the British and German air forces engaged in intense combat again over the Dover Strait yesterday. Fourteen German fighter planes flew across the Kent Strait in the morning, and twenty German aircraft followed at 3:00 PM. British Spitfire planes and anti-aircraft artillery immediately responded to the attack. At the same time, a large number of British fighter planes and bombers flew like a tide over the strait, concentrating on the northeast and southeast of the Dover Strait, and launching fierce surprise attacks on Calais, Dunkirk, and Ostend. They engaged in fierce aerial combat with German aircraft over the strait. Another group of British aircraft flew into German territory and bombed the Ruhr industrial area.

<p>Washington - Just as news was spreading that Germans had sunk a ship flying the American flag, senior officials declared last night that the U.S. government would disregard rumors of German enemies misusing the American flag, and would hold Germany responsible for the sinking of the American ship. Senior government officials stated that if Germany "mistakenly attacked American ships, the U.S. government would arm its merchant fleet as it did during the last war and instruct the captains to resist." It was alleged that newspapers under Nazi control recently suggested that if the British frequently flew the American flag on their ships, Germany would not be responsible for the mistaken attacks on American ships. At the same time, Germany declared that the "Canadian Cruiser," a passenger ship painted with the American Stars and Stripes, had been sunk, prompting the U.S. government to conduct a thorough investigation. According to the initial reports of this incident, the U.S. government is currently investigating to fully understand the situation and then decide on a course of action. (International News Service dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German government announced last night that the "Canadian Cruiser," flying the American flag, had been sunk in the Indian Ocean. Germany seems poised to pressure Washington to thoroughly investigate the matter. The German High Command testified that the surviving sailors of the ship were all British. The German side said that it might demand that the United States actively guarantee that "such misuse of the American flag cannot be tolerated." The High Command further stated that "the sailors of the Canadian Cruiser" confirmed that the ship was British. In some aspects, the meaning of this statement is interpreted as that although not all of the ship's sailors were rescued, this portion was all saved. (International News Service dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>New York - Neither the State Department in Washington nor the Navy Department in Ottawa have received any information about the German claim that a ship named the Canadian Cruiser, flying the American flag and bearing American markings, has been sunk. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, "German Foreign Policy News," commented on the sinking of the Canadian ship "Canadian Cruiser," flying the American flag, in the Indian Ocean, believing that British merchant ships dare not fly their own national flag and instead fly foreign flags. The British maritime hegemony has disappeared. Canadian shipowners must be well aware that the United States opposes foreign ships flying the American flag, but they still fly the American flag. The British intention to shirk responsibility has been proven again. Britain cannot get European countries to participate in the war and is focusing its activities in the United States.

<p>Bayonne Port - The French cargo ship "Guilvinec," weighing 5,000 tons, which sailed from Nantes to Oran in North Africa yesterday, was suddenly sunk by a foreign submarine with electric torpedoes 200 miles off the Spanish coast.

The remaining crew members were rescued by a Spanish fishing boat and landed in the Spanish port of Pasajes. Twenty-two of them arrived here today. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e30">International Anecdotes (7) Record of the Mayor of London's Inauguration During German Bombing Raids <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Sir Clarkson, the Lord Mayor of London, had reached the end of his term, and according to their privilege, the citizens elected a new mayor. Thus, the energetic Sir George Wilkinson, only fifty-five years old, was elected with the support of the majority of citizens.</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony of the Lord Mayor of London is one of the greatest ceremonies in Britain. Traditionally, the mayor must lead the judges, ride in horse-drawn carriages through the city, showing his power that can rival the emperor. The new mayor must also hold a grand banquet in the City Hall to entertain guests. This year, due to the war, the parade was canceled, and the banquet was scaled down to a luncheon to comply with wartime food control regulations. There was no pheasant and dove soup and gold plates, and no white wine expressing affection after the meal. The jewels on the ladies' evening gowns also had no room to be displayed. The mayor's wife should have had a boy to hold her train and six bridesmaids to attend her, like a queen's coronation, but this was also canceled.</p>
<p>On the day the new mayor took office, London issued an emergency air raid warning, indicating the arrival of German planes. However, Sir Wilkinson still arrived at the City Hall on time to hold the inauguration ceremony. Although complicated formalities were omitted, the solemnity and grandeur were not diminished. Prime Minister Churchill also attended in person as usual.</p>
<p>The citizens of London have long enjoyed the privilege of electing the mayor. More than seven hundred years ago, King John was tyrannical and oppressive, and the citizens of London rose up in resistance, drawing up three chapters of law with him, and obtaining the right to self-government and to elect a mayor. This right has not been shaken to this day.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor of London has supreme power within one square mile of the city. Even if the king enters the city, he must be granted the key and sword by the mayor on behalf of the citizens before being allowed to enter. Even royalty and nobles must give him some respect. No army in the country may march through the city in formation without the mayor's special permission. Only a small number of troops reorganized from the former London local army may pass through with bayonets fixed and flags flying, but the mayor must also be notified in advance.</p>
<p>The London police are an independent force, totaling more than one thousand in peacetime. The mayor has a bench of judges under him. He also serves as the chairman of the City Council and various municipal committees. In short, this square mile is all his domain.</p>
<p>Because the Lord Mayor of London has such great power, the citizens must make a great display when the new and old mayors change, to show solemnity. This time, some trivial rituals have been cut down because of the national crisis, which is already very unavoidable.</p>
<p>When the inauguration ceremony of the new mayor began, the outgoing mayor Clarkson sat in the middle, and the new mayor Wilkinson and his wife sat on his left and right. Next were Prime Minister Churchill and the Archbishop of Canterbury, sitting on their left and right. The city councilors, each wearing lavender robes, sat around the council seats. The mace-bearer first walked up to the table, bowed three times, and placed the mace on the floor, indicating that the term of the previous mayor had expired. Then, the new mayor Wilkinson took the oath of office, and exchanged seats with the previous mayor, completing the handover ceremony.</p>
<p>When the new mayor was seated, the master of ceremonies handed the crystal mace, the gold tablet, and the seal of office to the former mayor, who passed them on to the new mayor. At this time, the city officials one by one paid their respects to their new superior. The sword-bearer handed over the ceremonial sword, and then took it away again. The mace-bearer picked up the mace, the secretary presented the seal, and the auditor presented the employment document and the sealed register. Finally, the former mayor handed over the keys to the city seal vault, the hospital, the budget bureau, and the weights and measures. Each official had to bow three times when coming forward and when retiring, as if they were seeing the emperor. The prominence of the Lord Mayor of London is truly something to be proud of.</p>

<h3 id="e31">British and American Efforts to Prevent Japan's Southern Advance Will Militarily Aid China; Far Eastern Crisis Hinges on Japan's Actions; Foreign Observers Analyze the General Situation <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Whether the Pacific war can spare us and what impact it will have on China's future are matters of concern to all parties. According to a foreign observer yesterday, whether the Pacific storm can dissipate depends on whether Japan is keen on invading the South. Japan itself is mired in the quagmire of invading China and lacks the strength to extricate itself. However, as one of the Axis powers, it looks to its leader Hitler in all matters. Hitler, unable to conquer Britain, is driving Japan to coordinate in the Far East to divide Britain's power and facilitate its war efforts. Japan believes that unless Germany can defeat Britain or at least get a share of the spoils, it has no other good options. Therefore, although its posturing for a southern invasion seems imminent, Britain has obtained active assistance from the United States, and the United States, recognizing that the loss of the lips leads to the teeth being cold, and for the sake of consolidating its own interests in the Far East, is taking the same steps as Britain, strengthening its air and sea bases in the Far East to deal with those who harm its interests in the Pacific. It will not tolerate or concede, and will never allow those who advocate "East Asian Co-prosperity" to reap the benefits. Since these "East Asian Co-prosperity" advocates cannot bluff and intimidate the democratic countries, if Japan weighs its own strength and considers Germany, the war may not break out immediately. If Japan insists on going its own way, or estimates that Britain cannot attend to the East and the United States will not participate in the war, and is willing to be the culprit, then British and American aid to China will not only be limited to economic assistance as it is today, but will inevitably go further to military aid, increasing China's military advantages to achieve a pincer effect. What China lacks in its war effort is only military equipment, and then it can launch a full-scale counterattack, like sweeping away dead leaves, and stand on its own to win.</p>
<p>So-called Peace is Not Credible</p>
<p>The famous commentator Mr. Woodhead published an article in the English-language "Great American Weekly" yesterday, discussing the crisis in the Far East, stating that the reason why the peace talks of Japanese diplomats are not accepted by Britain and the United States is that Japan is a member of the "Unholy Tripartite Pact". Britain and the United States are deeply concerned that Japan's current peace gesture is the same as the behavior of Germany and Italy before engaging in aggression. Before Germany invaded the "Low Countries," it also issued its intention for peace, but within a few days, it was known for invading the "Low Countries". Before Italy invaded Greece, it also provided guarantees, but a few days later, it invaded Greece without prior warning. This is the specialty of the Axis countries. Therefore, Britain and the United States have sufficient reason to suspect Japan.</p>
<p>Nazi Personnel Active in Japan</p>
<p>Japan recently passed a "National Defense Secret Law," prohibiting participation in any activity aimed at benefiting foreign countries and prohibiting propaganda activities for foreign countries. However, Nazi secret agents are active in Japan, doing their best to win over Japan to participate in the Axis countries to fight against Britain. This is an open secret. Germany's purpose is to restrain Britain in the Pacific and divert the attention of the United States. When Hitler made this plan, he only considered the interests of his own country and did not care about Japan's interests. Germany may be generous with other people's property and give the land of the Far East to Japan, but it is unwilling to see an empire in the Far East that is hostile to it. This is something that does not require a wise man to know.</p>
<p>The United States Watches Japan's Actions</p>
<p>The situation in the Far East is still tense and there is no sign of relaxation in the short term. US Secretary of State Hull said that Americans judge Japan not by observing Japan's words, but by observing Japan's actions. But judging by Japan's actions, the crisis of war in the Far East has not disappeared. The United States has never agreed to Japan's "East Asian New Order" plan, and they are even more opposed to Japan expanding the "East Asian New Order" into the "Greater East Asia New Order". If such a plan is realized, the interests of the United States in East Asia will be swept away.</p>
<p>The Situation Has Become Intolerable</p>
<p>When the US House of Representatives was in session, it discussed the bill to defend US Pacific islands, which proves that the United States is dissatisfied with Japan's past actions and plans to take action here in the future. Last year, the United States intended to build defenses in Guam, but it was worried about Japan's opposition. Now, the United States has ignored Japan's reaction. Studying the debates in the US Congress, it can be seen that the United States can no longer tolerate Japan's actions and refuses to use appeasement to improve relations between the two countries. Under this situation, although Japan does not admit that it has aggressive intentions, the situation has reached this point and cannot be improved by Japan's words. Although every action of Britain and the United States is purely defensive in nature, it is enough to show their distrust of Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The Japanese Forcefully Conscript Laborers and Concentrate Them in the Wing On Cotton Mill; Many Are From the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Area; No One Is Seen on the Streets of Yangshupu at Night <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 22nd), it was learned from reliable sources that the Japanese labor conscription teams continued to operate in the area north of Suzhou Creek controlled by the Japanese and used the Wing On Cotton Mill on Xihu Road, which was confiscated by the Japanese during the war in Shanghai, as a gathering place. It is said that the Japanese always set off to conscript laborers at night or early in the morning, taking advantage of the darkness. Sometimes the conscription lasted until 7:30 in the morning. It is also said that the conscription did not start on Saturday and Sunday of last week as previously reported, but that the conscription teams were already active on February 14.</p>
<p>Escaped Coolies Dare Not Speak Out</p>
<p>Information about this activity is still being collected, but most of the coolies who were conscripted and escaped are afraid of retaliation, so they are unwilling to describe their experiences in the hands of the Japanese army. Moreover, many of the men who were conscripted have families, young and old, who depend on them for a living. Nowadays, the cost of living is increasing day by day, and this person who feeds the whole family has been conscripted, or the family has no food left. It is not difficult to imagine the tragic situation.</p>

<p>Although the Japanese side has already admitted that it is forcibly conscripting Chinese people in its controlled areas, the officers have investigated the saying that Chinese male adults who have to support their whole family are also being forcibly conscripted. Now, they are going to the homes of these male adults and promising that if this is the case, the Japanese army will subsidize their households. It is said that there are more than 500 Chinese people detained in the Wing On Cotton Mill on Xihu Road, many of whom were conscripted in Pinghu, Jiading, and Minhang and transported by trucks. The rest were escorted from Haiyan, Xiashi, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou. There are quite a few people who have escaped from the Japanese detention, but they are afraid that if they are forcibly conscripted again, they will be severely punished, so they remain silent about their detention experiences.</p>
<p>Workers in Hamakita Dare Not Go Home at Night</p>
<p>However, it is a fact that there is no one on the streets of Yangshupu at night, and those who live in Hamakita and work in Hamaminami during the day stay in Hamaminami at night and are unwilling to return north. In March last year, the Japanese also forcibly conscripted laborers in Hamakita. The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy denied this, saying that the conscription was due to the arrest of criminals in Hamakita.</p>
<p>Passengers Decrease Sharply, Xiashi Stops Trading</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway forcibly conscripted civilian laborers in this controlled area, this trend has not stopped. According to a visitor who just arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway began to forcibly conscript civilian laborers on the 16th, and more than 1,000 young Chinese people were forced to be conscripted. Xiashi was the most affected, with a total of more than 600 people. All the shops in the town were closed, and residents stayed indoors. It gradually recovered after five days. The residents of Chang'an, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Jiashan, and other places who were arrested were forced to board trains heading north, and there has been no news of them since. Now they all stay indoors and shops have closed down. The situation has suddenly become desolate, and the number of passengers taking trains has also decreased sharply in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Americans' Feelings Towards Japan: Conclusions From Conversations in Hotels, Trains, and Barber Shops Coincide <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>A special correspondent for the English-language "Great American Weekly" in Chicago reported that people in Shanghai thought that the US authorities' notification to the Far Eastern American expatriates to withdraw meant that the United States was fully focused on the Far Eastern situation. In fact, the United States only recognizes that the Far Eastern Bureau is a secondary event. This is their mistake. It does not mean that the United States believes that the Far Eastern situation is already calm. The actual situation is completely the opposite. As far as the American people are concerned, they have been very concerned about the Far Eastern situation for the past two or three years and have analyzed it. What they expect is only the final solution.</p>
<p>No More Propaganda, Just Waiting for a Solution</p>
<p>American anti-Japanese propaganda is not as strong as it used to be because the American people's hatred of Japan does not need to be publicized again. Americans are also convinced that there will be a final solution to the Far Eastern problem. The Open Door Policy cannot be ignored. American interests cannot be violated. The American people, regardless of old or young, north or south, 95% of them firmly oppose Japan. All of Japan's troublemaking actions have strengthened the American people's anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
<p>The Same Views in All Social Classes</p>
<p>When we first arrived in San Francisco, we chatted with the customs guards. Because we came from the Far East, the focus of the conversation was undoubtedly on the Far Eastern problem. The guard concluded, "We hate Japanese soldiers. Any American is willing to fight Japan for their country." We also discussed this issue with travelers in hotels, passengers on trains, employees in barber shops, and people in the press. Their emotions were the same as the customs guard.</p>
<p>The Government Is Determined and the People Support It</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the United States does not want to start a war, but they are more willing to fight the Japanese than the Germans, even though their interests in Europe are greater than in the Far East. The reason why the Far Eastern problem has changed from a primary to a secondary position is based on this. Today, newspapers no longer need to publicize to the American people the suffering of their compatriots in the Far East, nor do they need to awaken the American people to recognize that their government's policy is accurate. With the enthusiastic support of the people, the American government is almost determined.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Rice Weevils Endanger the People's Food Supply; A Deadline Is Set for Secret Investigation and Detention; The Vietnamese Authorities Allow a Large Amount of New Rice to Be Shipped to Shanghai; The People Need Not Panic and Disturb the Order <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The authorities, recognizing that Shanghai's food supply is extremely abundant and the source is continuously on its way, with a daily arrival of about 20,000 to 30,000 bags, and that the reason why rice prices are rising is that some unscrupulous rice merchants are being used to deliberately grab rice supplies in the market, attempting to confuse the people. Now, in order to relieve the people's distress and stabilize the entire food supply, they have ordered the city's agency responsible for stabilizing rice prices to conduct a secret investigation of these unscrupulous rice weevils as soon as possible, set a deadline for reporting the list, so that they can be severely punished according to the crime of endangering the people's food supply, or their business qualifications can be revoked. Now the city's agency responsible for stabilizing rice prices is said to be starting a secret investigation soon, and it is expected that these people will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Stopping the Price Surge</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions are deeply concerned about the city's entire food supply. In view of the past crisis and to prevent future shortages, it is said that they telegraphed the Rice Industry Association Committee yesterday to ask about the root cause of the recent rice market price surge and immediately ordered them to find ways to stop the rice price surge and various illegal transactions and strictly implement the price limit set on the 3rd of this month. If anyone dares to disobey, they can report to the authorities, who will provide strong assistance. The Rice Industry Committee has followed suit. It is also learned that the authorities have also ordered the stationed police detectives to strictly check the certificates of people entering and leaving the rice market and the actions of rice weevils buying and selling in the market. If any misconduct is found, they will be arrested and punished.</p>
<p>Evaluation Committee Consultation</p>
<p>The root cause of the recent rice price increase is the manipulation and monopoly of speculative rice weevils. If this continues, the future of the people's food supply will become increasingly worse. It is now learned that the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, in view of its responsibilities and in order to follow the instructions of the authorities, has decided to convene a special committee meeting in the coming days to discuss long-term, specific measures to stabilize the rice market and stop illegal transactions in the market. The price limit for 15 kinds of foreign rice will also be submitted for review. If it has exceeded the legal profit of 5%, the committee will continue to lower the price to lighten the burden on the people. However, for the sake of caution, the committee will invite representatives from the authorities of the two concessions to attend the meeting and give instructions so that they can be followed.</p>
<p>Saigon Shipping</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice from abroad has never been interrupted, and it has become more abundant recently. According to a rice industry tycoon yesterday, more than 650,000 bags of foreign rice have been shipped from overseas since this month, which can meet the city's food needs for one month. Furthermore, the quantity shipped to Shanghai recently has not diminished. A certain rice shop received a telegram from its counterpart in Saigon yesterday, "The ordered rice will be shipped today, and the Vietnamese authorities have approved the export of a large amount of new goods." It can be seen that the rumor that the Vietnamese authorities have banned the export of rice is obviously incorrect. Moreover, the Vietnamese authorities have also approved the export of new goods, so the rice weevils' rumors should not be believed by legitimate rice merchants. Merchants and people should also wait and see how the authorities will deal with the rice market in the shortest possible time. There is no need to panic and scramble to buy rice, which would be taken advantage of by the rice weevils, and do not cause disturbance to maintain public order.</p>

<p>— T.V. Soong</p>
<p>Mr. T.V. Soong delivered a speech at the reception of the China-America Council in New York on the evening of January 23 this year, reviewing the Sino-Japanese problem and strongly criticizing Japan's reckless actions. All its ambitions will eventually become bubbles, and China, relying on its vast territory and infinite potential manpower, as well as the enthusiastic assistance of friendly countries, will certainly continue to fight for permanent peace to prevent Japan's southward advance. After the speech was published, it received much sympathy from Chinese and foreign people. The official translation of the full text has just been sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai yesterday, and it is specially recorded and published below.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, I went to London to attend the World Economic Conference and passed through New York. I spoke to you about the Japanese seizure of China's three northeastern provinces, saying that this problem, in the feelings of the general American, may be a distant and irrelevant event, but this is actually the beginning of international predatory behavior. If it is not stopped in time, it will progress step by step and inevitably become a terrible and effective precedent, evolving into other illegal actions that will drag the whole world into the vortex. A few days later, when I arrived in London, I gave a similar speech to the China Committee of the British House of Commons, chaired by the then Foreign Minister Sir John Simon, and quoted the words of Macaulay's historical thesis to confirm my words. Macaulay discussed that after a long period of peace in Europe, the Prussian King Frederick the Great's seizure of Silesia led to the "Seven Years' War," which eventually disturbed the world, so that "black people fought on the shores of Calamanda, and red people fought by the lakes of North America."</p>
<p>At this time when the flames of war cover the world, I am unfortunately correct in my words. It is meaningless to mention it today, but the second point I discussed at that time is fortunately correct; that is, the Japanese aggression will forge the hammer to unify China. China, in the midst of disaster, with the sacrifice of hot blood and the loss of finance, is invaluable, but the country will find its soul to step into the right track. Since I arrived in the United States this time, people have asked me, that is, Japan has the world's first-class army and navy, and a large number of new-style air forces. China, which loves peace, has neither a navy nor an air force, and the army is not fully equipped. How can it resist and defend itself? Tonight I will try to answer, but no matter what explanation we make, if we examine the infinite difficulties that our country has overcome, we will know that the real answer can be found in Cromwell's mysterious words. Cromwell said in a painful environment, "Relying on the righteousness of heaven and earth, we, though weak, will surely defeat the tyrants."</p>
<p>Fortunately, at this time of crisis of survival in China, we have found the person needed by the times, General Chiang Kai-shek; and the democratic countries, in the face of the alliance of Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoe, have outstanding leaders such as Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek, and the great President Roosevelt as their support, doing their best to help. This is the greatest good fortune. People usually think that Chiang is just a famous general. In fact, Chiang is also a great modern statesman who has a clear understanding of the meaning of this struggle and the application of politics and strength. Therefore, Chiang's value as a politician should be emphasized more than his value as a soldier, because Chiang regards war as a tool to achieve his goals, which is completely different from the viewpoint of the Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>Now, let me give an example to illustrate this: At the beginning of the war, Chinese warships defended Shanghai for three months under the fierce attack of the Japanese army's mechanized land forces and navy. At the end of the second month, the situation was obviously that it would be difficult to hold the line without great sacrifice. At that time, German military advisors and those who sympathized with China advised the Chinese army to withdraw in time, but Chiang, because the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty were meeting in Beijing to try to stop the Sino-Japanese conflict, ignored this opinion and resolutely ordered the troops to defend for another four weeks. At that time, I was in Shanghai and witnessed the suffering of our soldiers. Our front line had a weak point, and the Japanese army concentrated artillery and bombs to attack with all its strength. Our reinforcements, division after division, defended the front line. Every division of troops suffered half the casualties the next day, and another division had to replace it the next day, resisting artillery shells with flesh and blood. The cruelty of the massacre was unimaginable. Here you can see an example, that is, even if the front line should be withdrawn from a military standpoint, it must continue to resist because of a greater purpose. Some say that the Beijing meeting completely failed, and the Chinese sacrifice in Shanghai in the last month was useless, but the real statesman is willing to suffer setbacks in local battles to save the victory of the entire war.</p>
<p>When Japan started the war in 1937, it was high-spirited. Konoe declared to foreign reporters and the Japanese people that within three months, it would defeat China and make it surrender. He thought that the victory of this war would be like today's so-called blitzkrieg, making a fierce attack at the highest speed, causing China to collapse overnight. Today, the Japanese estimate of the war situation is obviously wrong. We know that the prolongation of the war is beneficial to us. Under the state of war, the Japanese army, in addition to its millions of troops and thousands of aircraft, must maintain the world's number one navy. The prolongation of time will eventually exhaust it. To make the Chinese nation develop its great and solid strength, there must be sufficient time; to make the democratic countries understand that China is fighting for itself and other democratic countries, it also takes a considerable amount of time. When the democratic countries have this awareness, they will give China unlimited assistance.</p>
<p>China, as the first victim of aggression, has long recognized that if acts of aggression are tolerated and rewarded, they will lead to countless new acts of aggression, eventually endangering the democratic life of the whole world. After the outbreak of the European war, other countries gradually realized that the wars in Europe and Asia are different aspects of the struggle between democratic and totalitarian countries. Since Japan officially joined the German-Italian alliance on September 27, 1940, everyone has known that China's victory is the victory of the democratic countries, and China's failure is the failure of the democratic countries. China has achieved the purpose of prolonging the war. Not only has the war to quickly conquer China in three months failed to materialize, but now the war has been prolonged for three and a half years, and Japan is deeply mired in a bitter struggle and unable to extricate itself.

<p>Zhang Erniang (24 years old), a Jiangbei woman residing in a humble house in Rongshuilong, Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu, colluded with her lover and fellow villager from Funing, Pang Kaibao, on the midnight of February 21 of the year before last, using a sharp axe to strike her husband, Bao Youqing, on the head several times while he was sleeping soundly, fracturing his skull. After he died, they carried the body to a nearby pool and tied a rope around his waist with a lead bucket full of stones to sink it into the pool.</p>
<p>Pang Kaibao Sentenced to Death; After the incident, Pang was arrested by the Western and Chinese detectives of the Yangshupu Station and sent to the First Special District Court. Pang Kaibao was sentenced to death and awaited execution in the Huade Road Prison. Zhang Erniang took the opportunity to escape back to her hometown of Caijiaqiao and later married a Mr. Gao as his wife. She could not be arrested, and the court issued a warrant for her arrest. In January of this year, Zhang Erniang suddenly came to Shanghai with Mr. Gao and hid in a house at 1351 Roberts Road. She was discovered by Chinese Detective Chief Tao Genrong and Detective Xie Zhiguang of the Gordon Road Station. At 7 a.m. on the 15th of this month,</p>
<p>The Adulterous Woman Was Arrested; They rushed to the address to arrest Zhang Erniang and sent her to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened a court to hear the case. Detective Lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution based on Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of murdering her husband and asked that the defendant Zhang Erniang be given the highest degree of punishment to warn others from following her example. When questioned, the defendant claimed that she and her lover Pang Kaibao went to a theater that night and when they returned home, her husband Bao Youqing was not there. He had been arrested by the Japanese Command for theft.</p>
<p>The Confession Was Cunning; She completely denied that she murdered him and dumped the body in a nearby pool. When Pang Kaibao, who had been sentenced to death, was questioned, he refused to repeat his previous confession in court that Zhang Erniang had borrowed a sharp axe from an old woman named Li Jiang next door, falsely claiming that she was chopping wood, and then handed it to him to kill her husband while he was sleeping soundly. Zhang Erniang held the head of the body, and he held the feet and threw the body into the pool. He insisted, "I have been sentenced to death and am a fugitive. The prison wardens do not feed me enough every day, nor do they feed my fellow prisoners. I suffer from hunger. I ask the court to notify the prison wardens to feed me enough in the future, and then I will confess all the circumstances of killing Bao Youqing." Judge Jiang, based on his previous confession in court, which was indeed undeniable, and the process being as clear as a picture, announced that the case would begin to be debated, and Zhang Erniang was sent back to custody. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Issue 359 Wartime Finance in Germany By Zhou Shuhua <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>It seems that Germany under Hitler's rule does not feel much difficulty regarding wartime finance. We have not heard of them raising taxes, forcing savings, or issuing large amounts of wartime public debt. Recently, they even abolished an important tax. The tax revenue of Germany up to March 31, 1940, has achieved unprecedented results in this fiscal year; although millions of people cannot produce or pay taxes due to joining the military service, the tax revenue in the recent four months is sufficient to prove that there must be good results in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The savings of the people in the banks have a higher record every month. The interest rate of German public debt has been reduced from 4.5% to 4%, and at the same time, the term of newly issued public debt has been increased from ten years to twenty years. In fact, German public debt is quickly absorbed by the public and does not require major promotion. Because Germany has too much money, these facts are undeniable and are often greatly publicized by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Since 1933, they have been preparing for total war, and they have also paid attention to the financial aspect. Germany's advantage over Britain lies in the fact that Germany's debts from World War I were almost completely resolved due to the hyperinflation of 1923, while Britain still has to pay the principal and interest on its public debt. Therefore, Britain's tax revenue that can be used for war is somewhat inferior to that of Germany. However, this initial advantage is gradually disappearing because Germany has issued a large amount of new public debt to reorganize its military. In 1914, Germany's national debt was over 50 billion marks (approximately 2.5 billion pounds). In 1918, it had increased to 157 billion marks (approximately 7.85 billion pounds). At that time, this was a staggering number.</p>
<p>Germany's failure in World War I was not due to the collapse of its finances. When the armistice was signed, the German National Bank still had more than 20 billion gold marks, and Germany's overseas investments were estimated to be at least 20 billion marks. The reason Germany had to sue for peace was due to military exhaustion, mostly due to long-term strict blockades.</p>
<p>However, the heavy burden of territorial cession and reparations after the military failure, with debts extended for at least fifty or sixty years, made Germany's post-war desire for cancellation an urgent matter. Germany could only overcome this difficulty under one condition—that is, having an unlimited market that could accommodate and absorb its countless industrial exports. Undoubtedly, one of the basic reasons for this war lies in the fact that Germany has been trying its best since 1918 to open up a vast foreign market to solve its financial difficulties, while other countries are also forced to compete on the same path due to their own war debts.</p>
<p>Before Hitler came to power, he knew that although reparations had stopped, to solve Germany's economic problems, he believed that the most important thing was to solve the unemployment problem, which required an unlimited market to accommodate German industries. With a market, the unemployment problem would no longer exist. However, exports cannot suddenly increase greatly. The emergency solution was for the government to "unrestrictedly" place orders itself. And rearmament was the most reasonable method. As for the German army, navy, and air force, they almost all had to be reorganized, and the needs seemed to be unlimited. Therefore, 60% to 70% of the orders accepted by the German industry came from this rearmament.</p>
<p>Almost seven million people have regained their jobs. These people used to live on government relief. Germany could avoid paying this huge amount, so the budget was balanced and government tax revenue also increased. The reason is that these workers can now pay taxes. The center of gravity of this process is of course that wages are paid by the government. Only a small portion of the money earned flows back, increasing tax revenue. The money earned is not a real economic profit.</p>
<p>At first, Hitler did not have to worry too much about imported raw materials because factories throughout Germany had a lot of inventory, and these raw materials were not of much use because of the global economic recession. According to German annual reports, when Hitler came to power, Germany had industrial raw materials and semi-finished products worth no less than 20 billion marks (or 1 billion pounds). Hitler also did not lack factory equipment. Before the Nazi group came to power, German industry had been completely on track. And there were many skilled workers. Therefore, a large number of products were waiting to be developed.</p>
<p>All that was needed to revitalize industry was (1) orders and (2) funds. These two items could be supplied by the government without restrictions. Orders came entirely from rearmament.</p>
<p>Hitler knew that such a vast project required a large amount of money. The source of this money is the secret of the German financial "miracle" and also explains the superficial success of German wartime finance. They do not use a single remedy. What is used are hundreds of clever plans, just multiple applications of a few basic principles.</p>
<p>Hitler believed that expenses increased without limit with production. But his approach regarded the manufacture of munitions as a purely economic product. Unless these munitions can be sold for export, then of course it is another matter. Storing some tanks and airplanes reduces some raw materials and freezes some working capital. If this work is to continue, unless funds can be borrowed continuously.</p>
<p>When Dr. Schacht was in office, he worked very hard to organize short-term borrowing. The German government used monopolistic financial markets and prohibited private issuance to force all savings banks, insurance companies, trust corporations, mortgage, and commercial banks to promote short-term treasury bills and subscribe to long-term government bonds. These treasury bills can be discounted, so they are almost the same as cash. Public bonds were quickly sold because government bonds are the best—at least in theory—and have good interest. Therefore, all the savings of the laboring classes, the profits from industry, banking, and investment, and the interest on bonds and mortgages are constantly and automatically helping the German government to reorganize its military. The money earned will flow back to do this work.</p>
<p>Hitler repeatedly advocated the necessity of "increasing and producing" because this could increase some tax revenue. Workers are forced to work longer hours. The government constantly ordered more sophisticated machines to increase output. Technical research is very important. Agriculture has been electrified.</p>
<p>Because of the heavy taxes of the party and the donations of the "Workers' Front" and "Winter Relief," their living standards have actually been greatly reduced. If they do not openly complain, it is because they at least still have work to do under Hitler's rule. Dividends have long been fixed at six percent. Profits exceeding this interest rate must be invested in government bonds. So shareholders do not enjoy the benefits of increased production. And to prevent unnecessary waste of people, rationing was invisibly implemented two years before the war.</p>
<p>If what Hitler said at the beginning of the war is true—he said that rearmament cost a total of 90 billion marks—then it can be shown that the German government had a total debt of 95 billion marks as of the end of November 1939, and between 115 billion and 120 billion in August 1940. Of course, the debts of other cities, towns, and villages must also be added.</p>
<p>According to records, German debt—including only a small portion of short-term borrowing—was 55.2 billion marks at the end of June 1940. When Hitler came to power, there was only 11.7 billion marks of debt.</p>
<p>From the second quarter of 1940, German national debt increased by an average of about 2.7 billion marks per month. Previously, it increased by 2.05 billion per month. In the first ten months of the war, the total amount of long- and short-term bonds issued was 21 billion marks. Minister Reinhardt recently declared that tax revenue can only cover half of Germany's war expenses. Therefore, Germany's national debt will soon exceed the total amount at the end of the last World War. Recently, Germany also admitted that it had to reduce the interest rate from 4.5% to 4% because it needed to raise more debt.</p>
<p>In an omnipotent country, production only barely exists, interest rates can be lowered again, heavy taxes can be levied again, debts can be partially or completely cancelled, and living standards can be further reduced by implementing a stricter rationing system; this method can be continued until the people can no longer tolerate it. Therefore, Hitler does not seem to be likely to fail due to the problem of fiscal balance. But Nazi finance is built on the premise that Germany must win because they can demand huge reparations by winning and transfer their own "bankruptcy" to Britain.</p>
<p>Hitler must assume that Germany will win and that the war can be ended in the short term, so he does not need to worry too much about the increase in national debt as in the past. He thinks that Britain will eventually surrender unconditionally. The tasks he should do at present are: (1) try his best to cope with all domestic expenses without implementing inflation; (2) all goods that have to be imported should be paid for with cash, securities, or exports. What clever methods has Germany been using to implement this all the time? Can Germany continue like this until the end of the war? If Britain implements the same methods, will there be the same effect?</p>
<p>If it is said that Germany has not increased taxes, except for increasing income tax by 50% and indirect taxes such as tobacco and alcohol by 20% when the war was declared, the reason is that Nazi Germany placed the financial system on wartime standards long before the war and greatly increased taxes until Hitler also believed that it could not be increased anymore.</p>
<p>If Germany can still increase taxes after the war, it is because consumption has been greatly reduced due to stricter restrictions.</p>
<p>If savings banks can continue to increase deposits, the reason is that more working hours can bring more income, but because there are restrictions on consumption, consumption has not increased. In Germany, hoarding wealth is a crime, and people's savings must be deposited in banks. After the bank's savings accumulate, they are transferred to the government in exchange for short-term treasury bills or long-term public debt. And if, although many workers have joined the front line, savings conversely do not decline during the war, it is because most of the work has been taken over by women, and fertilizers have been used on a large scale in farmland, and electrification has been implemented.</p>
<p>The reason why it is not necessary to greatly promote the raising of public debt for the war is that after the outbreak of the war, the issuance of public debt continued to be automatically sold by savings banks, mortgage banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, and other institutions because these institutions have a lot of idle funds seeking investment channels. According to the latest announcement, 275 million marks of 4% government bonds were issued in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and another 175 million marks were issued in the form of so-called "clearance bonds" (Li-Loans). This kind of public bond is probably to be repaid in the short term. A total of 4.5 billion public bonds were issued in March.</p>
<p>Germany's war resources are entirely due to (1) maintaining and increasing production; (2) reducing consumption through restraint; (3) all unused income automatically flowing back to the government. But Minister Lecht also admits that this amount is not enough to pay all war expenses, and says that donations and taxes can only bear half of the expenses. This means that Germany's debt must increase by at least 25 billion marks per year.</p>
<p>If the war intensifies, this number will inevitably increase further. Lecht also mentioned in the same speech that Germany borrowed 4.5 billion marks in March, which shows that Germany's short-term bonds must increase by 70 billion to 100 billion marks per year. From another report, we learned that Germany's monthly expenditure in World War I was 2 billion marks, and now the monthly war expenditure is about 4 billion marks. This increase is entirely due to the mechanization of the war.</p>
<p>At the end of 1932, the amount of banknotes issued was 3.5 billion, and by the end of August 1940, it reached a record high, with the amount issued increasing to 13 billion. From this point, we always feel that he is in the stage of expansion. In fact, the increase in currency, including dime coins, is even greater. At the end of 1932, the total circulation was 5.6 billion; at the end of July 1939, it was 12 billion marks, and now the amount issued is unknown because the number of dime coins is unknown. But Germany has not felt the serious impact of inflation. If the increase in Germany's territory and the increase in production are also taken into account, then the increase in the amount of banknotes issued may not be considered excessive. Because the "price stop" (“Price stop”) is strictly maintained under police force, so the impact of inflation is very difficult to detect anyway.</p>
<p>Maintaining finance by expanding credit cannot be applied indefinitely. At the end of 1937, credit expansion had reached its peak. At that time, production had reached its highest level; factories were processing and manufacturing, and there were no unemployed workers. Now, the president of the German National Bank, Dr. Schacht, declares that credit expansion will stop. Hitler also agreed. But he knew that unless the country could supply industry with "Infinite markets"—that is to say, unless it continued to work hard to reorganize its military—the unemployment problem would arise.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, Nazi Germany does not seem to encounter difficulties at present. Her biggest problem is whether she can maintain the supply of raw materials. Rationing was implemented two years before the war. Food and raw materials have long been stored. They have saved more than seven years of materials to deal with this great war.</p>
<p>To reduce imports, they implemented a four-year plan, resulting in the manufacture of various synthetic products—woven fibers, liquid fuels, artificial rubber—and the large-scale application of substitutes, such as replacing copper with aluminum. They tried their best to grow agricultural crops until—boasting of a good harvest!—that under the current wartime standard of rationing, Germany relied on its own country for 83% of its food. After the war was launched, food was limited to the minimum. A large number of items were stored in cold storage two years before the war was launched. Therefore, if the harvest is not good, it will not reduce the supply of food again, but it will inevitably have to rely on pre-stored food.</p>
<p>Germany cannot export those superior special products that people need, for example. Because Germany also needs it. She imports goods from neighboring countries in a very orderly manner by credit until the credit limit is reached. If possible, she pays for all imports with toys, musical instruments, glassware, porcelain, earthenware, glasses, dyes, medicines, and printing—all of which are produced domestically this year. Germany produces a lot of coal, so if there is a surplus, she will export it. The countries of the Balkan Peninsula also do not hesitate to advocate that Germany should reorganize their old debts.</p>
<p>But now, as in 1933, 1918, and 1914, Germany's current problem is how to find new markets under its own jurisdiction that are sufficient to consume its industrial exports to pay for all import bills and settle debts to other countries.</p>
<p>Translated from (The Cjoma Press, January 3rd, 1941)</p>
<p>(Reprinted from "The London Times") Such is What I Saw and Heard</p>
<p>Four American commercial banks have suspended US dollar checking accounts. Speculators. Obviously, what is the reason for the question? Why ask the question? The effect of this move is self-evident.</p>
<p>In the article "The Expansion of the European War and the Future of US Exchange Rates" in this journal's issue 319 on May 13 last year, it was suggested that the United States take over the funds of China, Japan, and other countries in the United States to curb speculation. At first, it seemed like a dream, but now it is like an ideal that is being realized.</p>
<p>In the article "The Future of the Sino-Japanese Currency War" in this journal's issue 352 on December 30 last year, the possibility of Sino-US currency cooperation was predicted; at first, I felt that it was too optimistic, but now it has become inevitable.</p>
<p>The fact that Germany and the Soviet Union expressed goodwill to each other in the early autumn was indeed shocking. However, the way in which they expressed goodwill still made Hitler worry about the East. The initial shock was really not worth it. It is now rumored that the principles of Soviet-Japanese economic cooperation have been signed in Moscow, which is another shocking news. However, what is surprising is why this news is specially released from Saigon? A Brief Discussion on Controlled Economy By Yan Maode</p>
<p>The organization of a controlled economy, that is, the agency that implements a controlled economy, or the general staff of the economy, the main body of this kind of headquarters organization, should be organized by the original government. If this kind of headquarters organization is not necessary at all, then the newly established organization should be reorganized by new forces and grant the original government authority over the activities of the industry. It can be seen that the scope, objectives, and extent of this newly established general staff should be determined by the method of constituting the organization and the powers conferred. And this kind of headquarters is dominated by officials, party members, etc., and it can be said that it is owned by capitalists. If it is dominated by the middle class, it will also have to change its face. Knowing the headquarters organization of this kind of headquarters means knowing the future development of this kind of organization, but the organizations of various countries are different. Each country has its own background and should be determined by politics. The organization of the general staff of the Soviet Union has the International Committee, Germany has the Economic Committee, Italy has the National Combination Agreement Council, and the United Kingdom has the Advisory Committee. These and other things show the different organizations of various countries.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the general staff, in its work, there are several clear goals: (1) How to reconcile the economic and political organization of liberalism and the government of a democratic system. From an economic point of view, liberalism is based on personal enterprise creation, so the government should absolutely freely agree to the creation of personal enterprise, but the democratic system is absolutely protecting the creation of personal enterprise, and it has been like this since the eighteenth century. From the trend of modern enterprise development, concentrated enterprises are greater than personal enterprises. Under a democratic system, it is not necessary to oppose this system. Of course, it is necessary to pay close attention to how to guide personal enterprises to the road of concentrated enterprises. This will inevitably require a new organization to take on the responsibility, which requires an economic general staff. (2) How to apply specialized science to enterprises to increase their organizational power, and the power of this organization was even more obvious after the last world war. (3) How to reconcile the interests of the state with the interests that conflict with the state. In other words, how to reconcile the conflicting interests between countries. (4) How to establish a general staff so that the old productive forces in the economy can be applied to the happiness of the society. Based on the organizations currently adopted by various countries, the power granted to this organization, and the motives and methods of the organization, the economic achievements controlled by various countries are different, so their nature and direction are also different. Commercial News Economic Miscellany Clock Time By Feng Liutang</p>
<p>The influx of chiming clocks into China began in the Ming Dynasty. Feng Shike of the Ming Dynasty once said in Pengchuang Reading Records:</p>
<p>"I saw the Western Taoist Li Mabao have a chiming clock, which is only like a small incense box, with twelve hours a day, chiming twelve times in total, which is also a strange object."</p>
<p>It can be seen that at that time, Feng was a rare object. On September 15th of the fifth year of Chongzhen, there was a lunar eclipse. Because the timing calculated by the Qin Tianjian, the Huihui Department, and the Western method (that is, the method transmitted by Li Mabao, etc.) was different, Xu Guangqi presented a memorial stating the reasons for the difference, mentioning the timing method:</p>
<p>"The method of determining the time in the morning and evening, the pot leak is the ancient method, and the wheel clock is the new method, but it is not as good as seeking the end from the sun and stars. Use the sun during the day, and use a star at night. All use instruments to measure the longitude and latitude and calculate it. This is the timing method."</p>
<p>The so-called "wheel clock is the new method" refers to the chiming clock. Take the time from the sun and stars to measure the hour, which is the sidereal time.</p>
<p>Why is it called a chiming clock? Because it can strike the bell and sound the time when it arrives, without human intervention, so it is called chiming, and it is also called a time clock.</p>
<p>But the automatic striking of the bell to tell the time also existed in ancient China, starting with the bronze armillary sphere made by Tang monk Yi Xing and Liang Lingzan, which was turned by leaking water, but it was not perfect. And in the fourth year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty, Zhang Sixun from Bazhong created it and presented it. Taizong summoned craftsmen to make it in the forbidden palace, which was completed in more than a year, and placed it under the drum tower east of the Wenming Palace. Its system started with a building more than ten feet high, and the machine was hidden inside, regulating the sky and measuring the earth, and setting up a ground wheel and ground feet below, and also making a horizontal wheel, side wheel, and inclined wheel, setting the body pass, middle pass, and small pass, seven sky pillars, a straight god shaking the bell on the left, knocking on the bell on the right, and striking the drum in the middle to determine the number of moments. Every day and night, it cycles and repeats. It also uses wood to make twelve gods, each in charge of one hour. When the time comes, they will hold the hour plate by themselves, circulate and come out, and determine the length of day and night according to the number of moments... It uses the Kaiyuan legacy method, operating with water, and when it freezes and becomes slow in mid-winter, it becomes sparse and rough, and there is no accuracy in cold and heat, so mercury is used instead, so there is no error. In the old system, the movement of the sun and moon day and night were all operated by people, and the new system is made by nature. It is especially exquisite. It is a pity that after Zhang Sixun died, it was abandoned due to disrepair, and the method was not passed down. Comparatively speaking, all kinds of Chinese productions are mostly like this, rising and falling with people, so there is no opportunity to improve production. The armillary sphere made by Zhang Sixun, although made of wood, also uses wheels and axles, and the sun, moon, and five planets are attached to it, and the length of day and night, the advancement and retreat of cold and heat, are all without error, which is like the so-called astronomical clock today in principle and use.</p>
<p>However, at that time, clocks and watches were still rare objects, and it was still like this in the early Qing Dynasty. However, during the Kangxi period, the Holy Ancestor of Qing presented chiming clocks as a gift to the Empress Dowager. In the tribute from the Netherlands in the twenty-fifth year of Kangxi, there was also a large chiming clock, so there were only many kinds of chiming clocks in the Qing Palace, displayed in a hall. Precisely because they were foreign imports, in the early Qing Dynasty, they were still limited to noble families. If you don't believe it, just look at the chiming clock in the room of Phoenix Sister seen by Granny Liu in Dream of the Red Chamber, which made a loud noise and was mistaken for a monster. The sixth chapter of the book says:</p>
<p>"Granny Liu only heard a clang sound, which seemed like she was beating a basket cabinet to sieve noodles, and she couldn't help but look around. Suddenly, she saw a box hanging on the pillar in the hall, and there was a weight-like object hanging underneath, but it kept shaking randomly. Granny Liu thought to herself, what is this thing, what is it for? Just as she was stunned, she suddenly heard a dang sound, like a golden bell and copper chime, which startled her, and then there were eight or nine in a row."</p>
<p>It can be seen that Granny Liu, who claimed to be "living under the Son of Heaven's limbs," still did not recognize this thing, and others can be imagined. Not only Granny Liu, but even Qing Long Xianglin's Zhujiang Mission Record still found the large chiming clock in Macau to be peculiar, and it said:</p>
<p>"There is a timing platform, and a giant clock covers it. A flying fairy stands on the corner of the platform, acting as a striking figure, also turned by a machine. It rings on time, starting with one sound at midnight, to twelve sounds at noon, and then starting with one sound at noon to twelve sounds at midnight, cycling day and night without any error. On the front is a round plate, with twelve signs of the zodiac during the day. When the clock moves at a certain time, the toad will move its finger to indicate the position."</p>
<p>Speaking of clocks, I deeply feel that there is the most information in Dream of the Red Chamber, which can show the types, forms, and values of clocks, such as in the fourteenth chapter:</p>
<p>"Phoenix Sister assigned tasks, and when the people in Ning Mansion were doing things, she said: 'People who follow me on weekdays all have clocks and watches with them. No matter how big or small things are, they all have a fixed time. Anyway, there are also time clocks in your upper room. I will call the roll at the second quarter of Maozheng, and eat breakfast at Yizheng. Anyone who receives a card to report back should only be at the second quarter of Wuchu.'"</p>
<p>It can be seen that there are time clocks in the upper room of Ning Mansion, and Phoenix Sister not only has clocks and watches herself, but also her personal servants all have clocks and watches, which is even more wealthy than Ning Mansion. There is a table clock in Baoyu's room, such as in the fifty-first chapter when Baoyu asked Qingwen if her head was hot?</p>
<p>"Qingwen coughed twice and said, it doesn't matter, why have I become so delicate? As she spoke, she only heard the chiming clock in the outer room ring twice with a dang dang." (To be continued) Cinchona Tree (Continued) By Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>After this, the name of the cinchona tree gradually attracted people's attention and was known to people. In 1727 AD, La Condomine, a famous astronomer who measured the length of the meridian in the equatorial region, saw the cinchona tree with his own eyes in Peru; later, at the end of the 18th century, many famous scholars and merchants also saw this tree during their travels or explorations in South America and wrote reports. However, it was not until 1820 that pharmacologists Pelletier and Caventou chemically extracted the chemical components of quinine, and Maillot, a military doctor in Algeria, disregarded all opposition and used it to treat the fever in that area. Since then, botanists and chemists have felt passionately interested in the study of cinchona trees.</p>
<p>As a result of all the exploration teams, it is known that this tree includes more than 60 species, only growing in a narrow arcuate zone on the eastern side of the Andes Mountains, from Venezuela in the north to Bolivia in the south, at an altitude of about 1,500 meters to 2,500 meters, with a climate of nine months of abundant rainy season and three months of considerable dry season. After the anti-malarial efficacy of cinchona bark became widely known, many medicine-gathering aborigines or mixed races flocked to these high mountain areas: they collected medicine by cutting down the surrounding cinchona trees halfway up, one person high from the ground! Their destruction and damage caused the cinchona trees to decrease day by day and have a tendency to become extinct. The Jesuit monks and all the explorers in the area saw the danger and seriousness of this matter, so there were plans for transplantation and cultivation. In 1850 AD, a French explorer named Weddel brought cinchona seeds from Bolivia to the famous "Paris Botanical Garden": the first few cinchona trees in India and Java were divided from the Paris Botanical Garden.</p>
<p>The Dutch in the South Seas Islands, after 20 years of struggle, in 1870, transported the first bag of cinchona bark to their country. But now this production is almost entirely in the hands of the Dutch, who have ten million cinchona trees of the best quality on the island of Java alone, producing 1,500 tons of "sulfurized quinine" annually. However, even so, we Shanghai people, who are close to the South Seas, still have to eat small white pills that cost two or three cents each! Shouldn't this be as essential to the daily use of the masses as bread and plain water! Are there any producers in the world who sincerely seek happiness for the masses?......</p>
<p>Reference books: Coutiere's Biological World, Caustier's Botany, (End) Chebai Returned to Small Four Corners</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was flat due to the Sunday trend. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was 80 yuan and 6 to 5 cents at the end of this month, and 80 yuan and 8 cents on the 10th of next month. Taikoo Chebai B mark was 80 yuan and 8 cents in the West, and 80 yuan and 4 cents in the East. The price of sticky four corners and HX mark in the West was 79 yuan, also down 4 cents.</p>
<p>The Firewood and Soap Price Increase is Intensified</p>
<p>The price of firewood is rising sharply due to panic over raw materials. The inventory of the industry is gradually decreasing, and the price is rising continuously. Yesterday, the price of Beautiful Brand was 575 yuan per box, Phoenix Brand was 570 yuan per box, second-class miscellaneous brands were 510 yuan per box, and third-class miscellaneous brands were 490 yuan per box. The price increase of soap is also quite strong because the supply from the factory to the industry is not enough for market sales, resulting in high and popular prices for weeks. Currently, the market price of Gubenzao is 31 yuan and 5 cents per box, Baixiangmao Soap is 27 yuan and 5 cents, Huangxiangmao Soap is 23 yuan and 5 cents, and Scissors Soap is 24 yuan and 5 cents.</p>

<p>Food, Clothing, Housing, Transportation, Food Therapy Miscellany By Wang Jue Lie</p>
<p>Food is essential for our human body. In addition to supplementing the substances consumed in the human body, this can help growth and development, and has a close relationship like machines and machine oil.</p>
<p>Food not only has the functions mentioned above, but also has several diseases that can indeed rely on the power of food to achieve the result of treatment.</p>
<p>Beriberi is a very popular disease in society. Everyone knows that this disease is caused by a lack of vitamin B. Then, as long as the missing vitamin B is supplemented, the disease will naturally be cured. Foods such as beans and jujubes contain extremely rich vitamin B. Patients with beriberi can eat more of these things during three meals a day, and the disease can disappear invisibly. Especially in Shanghai, most of the rice eaten is Saigon rice, which is really very lacking in vitamin B. It is also the best way for us healthy people to eat more vitamin B-rich beans and red dates to prevent beriberi.</p>
<p>For diseases such as bleeding gums or bleeding oral mucosa, fruits such as oranges, apples, citrus lemons, etc., have a special therapeutic effect because they contain vitamin C. The so-called clearing heat is not very reasonable. Bleeding gums and oral mucosa is a sign of vitamin C deficiency. Fruits contain a lot of vitamin C, so they have this effect. It is best to eat fruits raw, not cooked, as vitamin C will be completely dispersed by high heat.</p>
<p>Although pig liver and lamb liver are common foods, they are very good for night blindness. Night blindness is when the vision is blurred at night when it is dark. Pig liver or lamb liver is often cooked in a rice pot to maintain the original effective ingredients. Many night blindness patients often eat this kind of thing, and the blurred vision will slowly decrease, and it can be completely cured over time. The cause of night blindness is nutritional imbalance and lack of vitamin A during other diseases. Pig liver and lamb liver contain a lot of vitamin A, and the therapeutic effect will of course be good.</p>
<p>Miscarriage in pregnant women is the most annoying thing. If you encounter such a disease, you can eat more beef, liver, egg yolks, lettuce and other foods to prevent it. Although there are many causes of miscarriage in pregnant women, vitamin E deficiency is the most important. The above-mentioned foods are rich in vitamin E, so they also have considerable effects. Why Don't Chinese Women Have Hats? By Si Hua</p>
<p>Chinese women are not absolutely without hats. The phoenix coronet in ancient times, the headscarf in the late Qing Dynasty, and the current occasional discovery of woolen bowl-shaped hats on the heads of rural women; in addition to the phoenix coronet still being used by brides in old-fashioned weddings, it can only be seen in operas. Headscarves and bowl-shaped hats may still be cherished by elderly women, but young women, especially modern women, simply disdain them, so generally speaking, Chinese women lack hats.</p>
<p>But do Chinese women need hats? This is very easy to answer. Just look at the popularity of hairnets and hair ties to prove that women need a practical and decorative item on their heads. Because there are no women's hats, they imitate what they see in imported films and use hairnets and ribbons as substitutes. However, this kind of decoration only avoids messy hair and has no effect of protecting the nerves in the head. In fact, it is far from being a hat. Ribbons are even limited to girls and young women. It is inappropriate for middle-aged women to tie their hair with them, even if the color of the ribbon is not obvious. Therefore, women need hats of appropriate styles and materials.</p>
<p>We know that foreign women have many hats. Hats for wearing formal clothes are elegant and luxurious; hats for wearing casual clothes are light and generous; and hats for sports have even more styles, which can be matched with the clothes worn to achieve a beauty that complements each other. I remember didn't the seven dwarfs in the Snow White film all have very strange hats? This style of hat was first adopted by Hollywood actresses, and then from California to New York, and now it has become the most common casual hat for American women.</p>
<p>However, if women wearing short coats and short skirts wear this kind of women's hat, it is very elegant, but we who wear cheongsams can only sigh at the hat.</p>
<p>Fashion experts will never not think of women's hats, but before there are suitable and improved women's clothes, women's hats will not be given much attention. Women's hats absolutely have their development potential in China. Fashion experts can use their brains to invent them. After the invention, apply for a patent. In the future, if a hat becomes popular, you will immediately earn a lot of money, and the creators will have illustrious names in the history of women's clothing reform! As for how to make it popular after creation, someone suggested a clever advertising strategy, saying that you only need to hire hundreds of young women, wearing hats, to wander on Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, and you will be able to attract the attention of thousands of people. Women will imitate them when they see them, and gradually promote them. It is not difficult to make women's hats popular in Shanghai. Shanghai's clothing is the model for the whole country. Women's hats go to the inland areas, and they have both decorative and practical functions, so they will naturally have a broad future.

Then cut the pork, winter bamboo shoots, winter mushrooms (which must be softened with boiling water first and remove the stems), and fungus (also softened first and pick out the roots) into fine pieces, and mix them together and mix with an appropriate amount of salt, MSG, soy sauce essence, white sugar cooking wine, etc. to make a paste, but it should not be too thin. Then spread the made egg skin flat, spread the mixed meat paste in the middle, spread it horizontally to make it even, leaving about two inches at the front end, roll it up, and use water chestnut powder (first mix it well with cold water) to paste the joint. Make one roll for each piece, and arrange them in a coarse pot (spread five or six rolls flat in each pot, do not stack them</p>
<h3 id="e40">Zheng Xiang Zhuang Twice Sued for One Zhuang Draft <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Issued Promissory Note at Customer's Request, Dispute Arises from Apprentice's Loss</p>
<p>Zheng Xiang Tong Ji Zhuang at No. 15 Shunli, Beijing Road, upon the request of Hong Shiyuan, the owner of Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store, a frequent customer, issued an immediate promissory note (i.e., a Zhuang draft) No. 185 on January 8th of this year, and delivered it to Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store. The draft then passed into the possession of Dingtai Yong Yin Bank at No. 17 Changxin Lane, Tianjin Road. Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store then applied to the Zhuang to report the loss, claiming that the draft was lost en route. Hong Shuliang, the legal representative of Dingtai Yong Yin Bank, unable to cash the draft, recently engaged lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Zheng Xiang Money Exchange.</p>
<p>Ignoring Payment, The reason stated is that on January 8th of this year, the plaintiff received from customer Ying Yankang, also known as Kang Ji, a promissory note for 18,360 yuan issued by the defendant Zheng Xiang Money Exchange. The plaintiff, trusting Zheng Xiang Money Exchange and adhering to the principle of recognizing the draft and not the person, allowed Kang Ji to use it to offset 10,006 yuan in national currency. Subsequently, when the draft was sent to the Bank of Asia for encashment, the defendant unexpectedly stopped payment. On the 9th of last month, the plaintiff negotiated with the defendant, who stated that Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store had requested the stop payment. This case had been preliminarily heard once by Judge Ni, who ordered a postponement for further hearing. Meanwhile, Hong Shiyuan, the owner of Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store, separately engaged lawyers Fei Xizhen and Wang Hengyi to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Dingtai Yong Yin Bank, demanding the return of the draft, and also listing Zheng Xiang Money Exchange as a defendant, requesting a judgment for the payment of 18,360 yuan. The reason stated is that on January 7th of this year, through the mediation of Ying Yankang, eight boxes of cloth were purchased from Xinyuan Cotton Cloth Store, valued at 18,360 yuan. At about 11 a.m. on the 8th, a promissory note obtained from Zheng Xiang Money Exchange was given to apprentice Hu Bingkui to accompany Ying Yankang to Xinyuan Cotton Cloth Store in the Securities Building on Hankou Road to pick up the goods. Unexpectedly, at the Securities Building,</p>
<p>Elevator Crowded, When Hu Bingkui got out of the elevator on the fifth floor, he discovered that the draft was missing. He rushed back to the store to report. At that time, the plaintiff not only notified Zheng Xiang Money Exchange by telephone to declare the loss, but also submitted a written application, and published a detailed statement of the loss in both Shen and Xin newspapers, and reported the case to the police for record. Therefore, it is requested that the defendant Dingtai Yong Yin Bank be ordered to return the draft, etc. This case was concluded by Judge Li the day before yesterday, and a judgment is scheduled for the 26th of this month. The day before yesterday, Judge Ni continued the hearing, stating that after the deposit is secured pending the outcome of the case, whoever wins the lawsuit gets the money, which actually has nothing to do with the defendant. The court ordered a further hearing.</p>

<p>Sanda Bookstore, located at 331 Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, has been open for less than a year. It specializes in selling Japanese books. Yesterday afternoon at 2:50, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the bookstore. The Central Fire Brigade, being nearby, immediately rushed to the scene upon receiving the news and extinguished the fire in half an hour. Therefore, only the second floor and part of the facade were destroyed. During the fire, two hand grenades, ignited by the fire, suddenly exploded with a loud bang, scattering shrapnel in all directions, injuring a firefighter numbered 526 on his face and hands. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the police took away the shrapnel and investigated the source of the grenades.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported that detectives from the French Concession Police Department were investigating two major theft cases within the concession yesterday (the 22nd). The victims were the Deputy Manager of Citibank, Mr. Mackay, whose residence was burglarized of silverware worth approximately 29,000 yuan, and the British-Russian merchant Mr. Pronsky, whose residence was burglarized of approximately 30,000 yuan in cash. It is reported that Mr. Mackay has offered a reward of several thousand yuan to find the silverware and other household items stolen from his residence at No. 1931 Route Dufour. The two concessions have separately launched investigations into this case. Mr. Mackay has gone to Hong Kong, and his wife is currently in the United States. It is reported that the silverware and other items were stolen at night when his residence was empty. Mr. Pronsky, who resides at No. 1465 Route Lafayette, was robbed of approximately 30,000 yuan in US dollars and French currency a few nights ago. Detectives investigating this case have arrested the husband of Mr. Pronsky's maid and are interrogating him.</p>

<p>Liu, the wife of Wu Jixing, a painter from Anhui who lived at No. 152 Caishi Road in the French Concession, was 25 years old this year. She went to bed at 10 p.m. on the 22nd. After dinner, she forgot to extinguish the coal briquette stove used for cooking and left it in the room, causing her to fall into a coma from carbon monoxide poisoning after falling asleep. At 0:20 a.m. that night, Wu discovered her, reported to the police, and immediately sent her to Tzu Hospital. Because she had been poisoned deeply, she died before receiving treatment upon arrival at the hospital. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Funeral Home to be claimed by her family today. According to reports in various newspapers, there have been many deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning in Shanghai this winter. This is the first case in the French Concession. It is hoped that everyone will warn their families not to leave coal stoves in the room for heating, which could lead to the loss of life.</p>

<h3 id="e47">North China Daily News Cup Final: Youyou Lost to Russian Army Yesterday; 1-2, One Goal Each in First Half <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The 1940-41 North China Daily News Cup football competition, contested by thirteen teams, saw Youyou and the Russian Army clash for the championship yesterday morning at the Recreation Ground. The crowd reached 5,000 people. As a result of the competition, Youyou, despite a strong offensive, suffered a narrow defeat of one to two, unfortunately handing the trophy to the Russian Army. This was very regrettable. The North China Daily News Cup was founded in 1924. Except for one suspension in 1931-32, Chinese teams have only won once in the past ten years, when Youyou won in 1936. This year, Youyou had a wealth of talent and a strong reputation. In yesterday's match, they adopted an aggressive offensive policy, with the ball mostly circulating in the Russian Army's area. However, Youyou's defeat yesterday was due to Zheng Tongyu's absence, which meant that the internal defense relied entirely on Zhang Lingen. After Zhang cleared the ball with a long kick, the opponent intercepted it, and Jiang Chao ran back too slowly, the danger was indeed unimaginable. Therefore, the first goal conceded yesterday (after 18 minutes) was a result of this. It was not until Lao Jin desperately rushed forward and equalized the score that it was almost half-time. In the second half, Youyou's offensive became even more vigorous. However, the Russian Army's left-back, Weisa Sige, blocked the incoming soldiers and stopped the incoming flood. Youyou's barrage of shots were all saved by this man. At the same time, the Russian Army's goalkeeper was also not weak. After about 20 minutes of stalemate, the Russian Army scored another goal. Although there was still some time afterwards, the overall situation was determined by a score of two to one. In yesterday's match, the Russian Army's victory was indeed fortunate, as Youyou controlled nine-tenths of the time. At yesterday's awards ceremony, Mr. Marshall, Vice President of the Far Eastern Football Association, presented the awards. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>Russian Army</p>
<p>Qi Nien Tieliev</p>
<p>Saisige Shagulov</p>

<p>(Shaoguan News) The Guangdong Provincial Wartime Art Museum, formerly ordered by the Ministry of Education to be reorganized into an Art Institute, is currently preparing for all reorganization matters. The location of the institute has been decided to be newly built in a certain suburb of the city. The person in charge of the institute stated that after the reorganization, it will be divided into three major departments: fine arts, drama, and music. In order to enable learners to further their studies and research, it is planned to establish a one-year training class, recruiting high school graduates to train future middle school art teachers. In order to make art universally assist in combat, a three-month short-term training class will also continue to be held, recruiting local cadres, arts workers from various units, and civil education workers from the province for training, in order to promote social art education. It is found that the establishment of art institutes in China only shows that Guangdong society has a deep understanding of high-level art.
