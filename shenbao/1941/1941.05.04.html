<p>社評</p>
<h3>近東戰事爆發之後</h3>
<p>在巴爾幹戰事行將結束的時候，近東戰禍不出所料，又於一昨爆發：伊拉克軍隊在反英的新政府指揮之下。居然開砲轟擊哈巴尼雅地方的英國空軍根據地，雙方因以發生激戰，盛傳伊軍已佔領飛機塲，交通要點與煤油區，同時伊總理蓋朗尼聞已向柏林乞援，不問德方是否赴援以及如何赴援，英軍當務之急，顯在不待德方援助到達，先把數萬之衆的伊拉克軍迅速解決，以免星星之火，勢成燎原，是故今後數日內，英軍必須以最敏捷的姿態，發揮無上威力，以掃蕩此曾受其扶助的倒戈軍隊，如其不然，則小亞細亞的未來演變，必然又要爲英國增加極大的麻煩。</p>
<p>追究此次伊拉克突然轉向的內幕，其中雖不免夾雜過去英國殖民政策所遺留的若干政治的種族的乃至經濟的不安因素，但軸心份子的煽動與暗助，實是毫無疑問的主要動力；遠在本月三日伊拉克發生政變之日起，人們即警覺到希特勒在近東方面所佈置的第五縱隊，業已發生了初步的作用，前些天英國軍事當局於巴爾幹與菲洲戰事十分吃緊之際，突然派兵至巴斯拉港登陸，大槪就是因爲已得密報，不得不預爲之備，祗是英軍登陸未久，且人數究屬有限，此番倉猝應戰，難免又耍吃吃「被人佔先」的虧；所幸中東英軍司令華凡爾將軍乃是一位傑出將才，在軍事方面他必然知道如何應付這個並非意外的事變。</p>
<p>至就德國而論，她如果決意赴援，第一步當然祗能先以飛機助戰，倘欲派遣陸軍遠征，則馬上就耍發生路綫問題。假定自希臘南部，以運兵船運輸部隊前往叙利亞登陸，途中必遭英國艦隊的襲擊，其事之困難與危險，正與德軍之無法强渡英吉利海峽相同；最理想，當然是假道土耳其，直趨伊拉克北部的摩蘇爾油田，他日倘能在伊拉克方面站得住脚，則不僅叙利亞如甕中之鼈，即巴勒斯坦外的丹諸地，也將一一入其彀中，最後更不難一舉而掠奪蘇彝士運河，以切斷英國在紅海方面之動脈；但是這一切一切的前題，端在土耳其政府甘願受德國的支配，甘願把達達尼亞海峽區乃至整個國土，供納粹機械化部隊的長驅直入，甘願放棄已故凱麥爾總統所艱難締造的獨立基礎，以自儕於羅馬尼亞保加利亞之流；這種「讓步」暫時或者可以換得一些利益，（德國或以叙利亞爲土耳其入盟的酬報），但此與保加利亞之分潤馬其頓，匈牙利之佔據北斯洛文尼亞，又有什麼區別？恐怕這種不勞　得的「收穫」尙未消化，而國家的獨立主權，民族的光榮自由業已斷送，難道這就是土耳其民族所甘願接受的運命嗎？</p>
<p>此外，尙有一個不能不顧到的重大因素，那就是蘇聯態度今後的動向。據日方宣傳蘇德之間已訂密的，準備瓜分近東，一如前年之瓜分波蘭，但是所謂瓜分，欲其成立，必須雙方對於瓜分對象的分配，不起爭執，例如問題中的伊拉克油田，距離蘇聯高加索最近，今後倘使劃歸德國，史丹林未必樂聞，假定劃歸蘇聯，則希特勒豈非白忙？萬一莫斯科不待德國援兵開抵伊拉克，來一個「先下手爲强」，出兵伊朗，以控制伊拉克北部，同時鼓勵土耳其拒絕德軍假道，那麼，民治國方面所朝夕盼望的德蘇衝突，恐怕就要在所難免了。</p>
<h3>近東局勢發展倫敦異常重視</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間外交及軍事評論頃均信、英國軍事領袖將以堅强手段、應付伊拉克局勢、並作警吿軍事問題之嚴重性、不應估計太低、又稱設昨日之衝突果爲以爲大規模行動之先聲、則英國在中東之資源、必將因涸竭、據最近之估計、伊拉克陸軍有二萬五千人至三萬人左右、此外尙有砲隊十二隊·飛機四五隊·機械化隊若干隊、若輩之戰鬥力據稱甚屬平常、而該地之英軍速同著名之格爾卡隊及西克司隊在內、或可不再增援以應付伊拉克之局勢、然外交觀察家相信、許多德軍官甚或其他納粹兵士必已進入伊拉克、或遠較英國所疑慮者爲多、若輩又指陳、英國之重要輸油管、可因彼怠工者之行動而陷於甚大之危險、而不論此等怠工者是否巳在伊拉克或由自杜得坎尼羣鳥起飛之飛機載運至伊拉克、各評論家力言除保障英國之油源外、並應恢復土耳其之信念、並信英人必將採取强烈行動、以阻止德人問接控制伊拉克、此間人士並恐德人或採斷然之行動、以毀壞伊拉克之　國　要油井及運輸管、或竟冒險派遣大量飛機以成就此項目的、聞德人巳有秦克爾式連兵機數百架　用、此項飛機至少可載其全副配備之士兵二十人或相當重量之砲、此外並有新式巨型能載坦克車之飛機、聞此項運送飛機至少有一百架在里比亞，並聞當有若干架在希臘及巴爾幹、德人或將準備權牲、以此等飛機在伊克於戰鬥中下降、一如其在挪威及低地國所爲云、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>為保衛獨立自由　土國不辭一戰　決不背棄對英聯盟　土要人之明顯表示　後備兵九級定期召集入伍</h3>
<p>斯丹埠　「雅尼薩巴報」載有軸心方面宜傳土國巳修改其對英政策之消息、土國著名議員雅爾慶對此、頃加批評稱、土國若被迫爲國家光榮而戰、自將屹立於英國方面、非因英國有此請求、但因英土兩國之觀念與利益相同也、土國不能背離其對英友善與聯盟、而加入另一陣營、蓋土國若有此舉、實屬自暴自棄云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>蘇菲亞　保國方面昨預示土耳其不久將以友人地位、加入軸心國、土總統伊斯美新近在保京、與德高級外交官秘密會議、查上星期曾傳土總統出巡視察海岸防務云、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>柏林　德官方謂、駐土大使巴本於回國報吿土耳其政情後、已啟程回安加拉、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>瑞士京城　「羅馬人民報」頃載有駐巴爾幹半島訪員來電稱、土耳其不久即將與軸心國簽訂條的、觀於德國駐土大使巴本於返國述職覲見希物勒元首之後、即忽忽返歸任所、以及伊斯美總統前往安那托里亞省及地中海沿岸一帶視察防務兩事、即可知之、惟是伊斯美總統及陸軍參謀長却馬克將軍、雖雅不欲使土國冒任何危險、但同時對於危寗土國利益之任利行動、亦復不能容忍、吾人相信土國軍事領袖最近所採取之行動、均有重大意義、外傳此次伊斯美總統出巡各地、係受軍事領袖之慫恿、俾免總統感受外來危險勢力之包圍、但此其所謂外來勢力、實不僅指英國一國而已、抑土國總司令部雖贊成與德國進行談判、顧因其責任所在、對於防務自不能有所忽略、此外、土國若干地方疏散居民業巳　令中止、此層殆亦可目爲土國政局之重要發展云、二日哈瓦期電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（五十）美外交官的新典型</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統特選的駐英大使韋南特現在擔仟着美國「海外耳目」中最重要的一種新職務。他不是個職業外交家，也不倚賴外交官的俸給，他和英國的官塲極爲相得，這幾點都與他前任人物並無二致。然而不同的地方却多着呢。</p>
<p>章南特在國內國外努力推進民治社會有秩序的進步，巳有多年，所以英國自由黨和工黨對他的歡迎，不下於保守黨。他相信今日的外交政策「決不能也決不應和社會政策與經濟政策分離。」他以爲人類的幸福，唯有各國親善合作方能獲致，方能在目前國際混亂的局勢中，創造出一個世界，「使自由的人民彼此安居樂業。」</p>
<p>所以他非但是一個事業家，也是一個人道主義者，他要考察英國政治生活和哲學演進中的重要改變，報吿美國政府，未來的世界，或能由這種改變獲得一個端倪。</p>
<p>韋南特的出身，在民主國中可說是最貴族化。他出身於高雅的拓殖家庭，靑年時代受到最優良的高等敎育。他得到了一筆遺產，結婚後他的財產更多了。他的嗜好，也是許多人所願終身保持勿失的。</p>
<p>他曾在康谷特聖保羅學校中敎過歷史。他酷嗜研究戰略，他歡喜發掘美國政治上的秘密村料。他收藏書籍，油畫，阿刺伯馬和狗，又愛好紳士式的耕作。</p>
<p>他因目力不佳，在上次世界大戰中未能應徵入伍，但他會設法投入法國空軍，轉入聯軍部隊，出入火綫，攝取軍事照片，他回國時已升到上尉軍職。他的事業常常轉換，採油，伐木，開礦，經商，都有成就。</p>
<p>他本可經營這類事業，但他很早就放棄了這種安舒的生活，而爲平民謀公益。他曾硏究與工人幸福有關的工資，宿舍，營養，醫藥，工作時間，老年津貼等問題自願稍盡棉力。韋南特會有這樣一個大角度的轉變，其原因似乎沒有人知道，也是不容易解釋的吧。</p>
<p>他在一九一二年時開始顯出他的特點。據說他是普林斯登大學中三個進步黨員之一，其餘的學生，都擁護塔孚脫或威爾遜。稍後他在就任新海姆夏州長時的演說中表明出他的意志。他向該州共和黨保守黨分子說，他從一個內訌的共和黨員學習共和黨政綱，這人吿訴他，共和黨原是主張人權超過產權之上的。</p>
<p>當他在勃海姆　州實行他的新政，並擁護羅斯福總統在華盛頓所施新的時候，共和黨保守分子都不慊於他。他們不解全國進步派共和黨員何以提及他有爲總統的可能，他們至今依然未能明瞭。</p>
<p>韋南特的爲人，使人想到昔日的林肯總統。他身材頎長，直立如矢，兩眼朦朧，似有深思。他年方知命，說話有些吞吞吐吐，就是讀一篇演說稿子，也是道樣。他對於衣着殊不講究，一套深色的寬大西裝，穿着日久，任其皺痕纍纍，他的領帶歪斜不正，大概因爲一面談話，一面打結之故。他額上散亂的頭髮也從不加以整刷。他處處表示同情心。日內瓦一個居停女主人說，「韋南特入室，使人人都覺得精神一振。」他在日內瓦擔任國際勞工局長時，至少獲得了英國現內閣中兩位要人的歡迎，其一是工黨領袖皮文，其一是現任外相艾登。</p>
<p>他具有使人尊敬的才能，因爲他的尊敬人，完全出自誠意，他是一個耐心傾聽的人，他用低得幾乎聽不見的聲昔鼓勵往訪他的人說，「你知道我並不是一個專家呀！他這樣坦白的承認自己的才具有限。他很歡喜與客談話，一個十分鐘的的會，可以延長到一句鐘，因此人家都說他不是一個行政長才。</p>
<p>他慣常於說話時搜索適當的字句，以求達意，因此人家說他思想緩慢。他的言語，逡巡，易使聽者受愚，他們初時覺得替他發愁，終於立在走廊下歡呼讚美。他的外表無論如何笨拙，他那懇摯的精神自會發出光芒。</p>
<p>當他深思的時候，常會視而不見，聽而不聞。有一天在他的辦公室中和人談話，他把一件大衣懸於臂間，在室內來回走着，後來外褂跌落地上，他的思潮仍未打斷，依然信步行走，竟不知道他的兩足正踐踏着這件大衣。</p>
<p>凡與韋南特愈親　的人，愈不覺得他的可怪。所以康谷特的鄰里，都一致擁護着他。他的黨部知道他在普林斯登的迷戀，不願推舉他入州議會，他或者會永遠不能享受公務人員的生活。然而他的鄰人，一齊推戴他。當競爭劇烈，比數接近的時候，有如一九二四年的戰勝諾克斯上校，他在家鄕至少可以穩穩佔到十四比一的多數。他的本州雖不贊成州長連任，然而竟已三次推舉他蟬聯了。英國工黨對於他的信任，一定可以獲得不少同志。</p>
<p>他對於人類的溫柔慈愛，在康谷特曾有不少傳說。他某次到孤兒院中去，一個病重的孩子稱讚他的皮大衣，這位州長就在耶穌聖誕節派人送了一件皮大衣給他做聖誕節禮。又有一次在紐的將上火車的時候，他發現自己囊空如洗，無錢購買車票，原來他在聖保羅學校中，早已罄其所有，資助一個家庭多故的女傭了。</p>

<h3>各方一致傾售　金市下游　退至七百元關邊</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、轉向下游、價已退至六千七百元大關邊、各方人心轉疲、乃歐戰發展、美滙隨英金而亦回鬆、並且蹙傳美國實施凍結全世界資金之訊、故價在證券號金號與銀號及滙票商之接踵賣勢下、由六千七百四十元步退至六千七百〇一元、爲散空抵進拉住、終軋小二十八元、半日交易共一萬六七千兩、下午週六無市、飾金關金等均平、現金亦見隨落、永豐餘出一百兩、價照期交高一百三十元、祥和出一百兩、高一百十元、均德孚買進、最後時和出祥興永五十兩高一百二十元、亦軋小三十元光景、</p>
<p>烚赤回落念八元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初頗穩定、九點十五分開市六千七百三十五元、比上日收價低三元、次爲六千七百四十元、大豐、熾大·恆記·德孚及散戶等四起力售、聞本月美金五元一五六二五可結、價遂猛落見六千七百十五元、爲新豐永·成記·祥和收吸、提上至六千七百二十五元、本月美金硬至五元一八七五難賣、大豐裕豐永·德孚再來吐出、又降念餘元、跌至六千七百零一元、時外滙止鬆稍回、新豐永祥和力進、提上至六千七百十八元、午收又撳小至六千七百十元、比前日回小二十八元、照五月美金五元一五六二五結價、爲六千七百五十四元、計撳四十四元、收後退至六千七百〇七元、最後六千七百十元、上半日有三十九元差度、下午塲外亦未做開、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高一百三十元、收進比售出低七八十元、現標金價無市、</p>
<p>飾金兌價尚不變</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、仍掛七百〇五元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>美鈔十九元　進而復出</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價趨疲、英美金鎊因亦各跌一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票一度破入十九元關、卒以十九元零一分收盤、比上日仍軋跌五分、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票仍站二元零九分原盤、朝鮮票稍有供給、市價峪軟、晚市退爲一元八角三分、</p>
<p>證劵　公債不脫盤旋</p>
<p>公僓暗盤、咋日市况依然不脫盤旋狀况、檯上即有多頭出籠、形勢仍係疲莫能興、市塲交易未見起色、買賣均不見踴躍、閒散沉悶之狀、一時恐不易展開、故公僓市塲暫時又比較寂寞、昨日週六、祇做半日交易、同康聯和買丙種、順昌仁昌　戊種、故丙戊種一度抬高二至四角、惟以聯和又來賣出戊種、餘如九成聯益潤利敦餘辛孚供給不絕、雖仁豐德隆尙有胃量、已覺供過於求、乃又回小二三角、丁種開出、而甲種竟未能做開、市况結果高低互見、大都跌多漲少、成交數約計八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>股　交易、成交大中華大柴公司股一百股、價爲三十四元正、</p>

<h3>紗花　獲利出籠　紗市回鬆　實銷已吿淸淡　銀根亦稍轉緊</h3>
<p>紗市始高轉平、但趨勢稍定、此因連朝昂騰、上漲程度已鉅、引起獲利者出籠、以　檯面略鬆、同時實銷以週末不及上日之暢、足使人心帶平、目前市塲上、一般之議論、爲　千六百元未能冲出、或有三四十元之回風恐見一千五百五十元之價、再當拖進、不過變馬多空成交之額、依然旺繁、前　之變化、仍在多事中、二十支變馬高價爲一千五百八十五元、低價爲一千五百六十三元、午後因週尾關係、人心渙散、少數成交價爲一千五百六十三四元、據市塲上日前看好之原因、謂雙馬廠單本有二萬六七千包、邇來陸續减少、僅剩一萬七八千包、所以　者多而出者少、前途如何、未敢預卜、今日有棉紗一千三百二十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後市象挺秀、人氣熱烈、買手多而出戶少、檯風甚緊、叫喊聲大振、首般價爲一千五百八十元、因局勢緊張、少頃升至一千五百八十五元、此時價格一高、引起證券幫之多額巨量出檔、籌碼一鬆、市盤回下至一千五百六十六七元、此價迴旋甚久、多說銀根轉緊、且有擯持之象、中途稍有進進出出、復升至一千五百七十一元、終以現紗交易不及上日之旺、人氣轉淡、收盤價爲一千五百六十五元、查半日間成交統計八千零十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　六五〇內地　三六〇</p>
<p>同行　七、〇〇〇統計八、〇一〇</p>
<p>紗既平疲　棉銷轉淡</p>
<p>現棉情形、前日跟踪紗市而生色、中外各廠皆有相當的需要、人心一度振作、但海外運來之棉、數量甚繁、故昨市復趨淸淡、蓋上午紗市平疲、及廠方無意進貨、又屆週六故也、茲將昨日號家互做交易列左、</p>
<p>美米得林四一七協同興二〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>美彭家坡三二四丙　昌三〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>印蘭貢花　三順興昌一〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、成交不多、但同業人心仍因現紗情形良好、而市况看高、昨日永安又進印棉惠司登六百五十包、申新進彭家坡二百包、市價均約三百三十元左右也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業及華爾街實進而漲、續後又因各方獲利了結而回跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日約漲二　磅音、</p>
<p>又去年八月一日起至今年五月二日止美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>上市累計　一〇、四九七、〇〇〇包</p>

<p>至德國　一四九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>各港市存　六、一五五、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>印度棉市頗屬淡薄、因有歐洲出口商賣出、及多頭了結而感弱、收盤價格漲跌一二羅比不等、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况看高〇·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布客銷尚活</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市平穩、同業進出轉淡、客銷粵港幫續有納胃、本街及內地各路零星採辦、成交尙繁、細布細斜售盤參差、手貨小一二角、粗布組斜堅定、一部份缺俏貨漲一角至二角半、漂染布大市平平、本街成交各布三百餘件、粵港幫辦斜紋色布色斜等二百餘件、新加坡·暹邏等地採辦印花布漂布斜紋等四五千疋、</p>
<p>東布　昨市升降極微、白貨龍頭細布現棧單迴旋於五十一元七八角之間、至午收盤爲五十一元七角、較跌五分、彩球細布提升二角、飛魚跌二角、細斜堅穩如故、嗶嘰先跌後漲、亦無甚榮辱、收盤黃棧單售開一元六角一分二厘半、</p>
<p>出口　今（四日）有棉布一千四百四十件、運往香港、又有九百九十五件、運仰光、</p>
<h3>白嗶嘰供不敷求</h3>
<p>白嗶嘰今夏市貨極形缺乏、東貨尤甚、西貨高檔四十餘元者、尙有供給、普通及下檔貨、同業中一無所有、因之買方需要不得不配備高檔貨、按東貨高檔缺乏、下檔較多、下檔貨跳絲頗多而不潔凈、兼質輕薄、顧客齊不入眼、昨英製頭號白嗶嘰、每碼大半均批沽四十六七元、副號四十二三元、東貨頭號三十三四元、普通二十八九元、下檔次號爲二十三四元、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價大漲小回　—出限價獲利了結—</h3>
<p>昨糖市因連日暴漲、期現粗白、一致衝出限價、多方獲利、頗有吐出、乃見回鬆、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、外棧一百十三元七角、下午十三元二角、小八角、五月十日期貨一二兩日曾漲十二元許、昨上午爲一百十六元至十二元四角、下午一百十三元五角、二角、而以一百十四元九角收盤、小二元六角、五月廿日期上午爲一百十七元至一百十三元八角、下午一百十四元至十五元九角、小三元六角、荷赤仍緊、初爲八十七元半、至八上九元、下午八十八元、比四底升十元、太古車白B嘜前日西棧貨曾一百二十元、昨東棧爲一百十六元、小三元許、DY嘜叫一百〇七元、HX嘜西棧一百〇六元、三日有糖二百包自香港來、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤暗盤抬高</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、近日到　尙不寂寞、月有數艘裝來、但以屑子爲多、致塊煤行情俏俐異常、經理行家同業行拆、雖仍三百七十元老盤、但以兩籮爲限、倘欲多數、祗向市塲搜購囤戶老單、暗盤較明市抬高六十元、致本街門莊紊亂非常、篩塊送到客戶、每噸須四百六十元云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海南圓肉雖升　號方朱肯盡數售出</h3>
<p>海南圓肉、近乏再到、號貨雖步升三四十元、但尙未肯盡數售出、昨又叫升五元、行方觀望未進、其勢堅持之後、必可成盤</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛會司鐵　依然堅昂</h3>
<p>靑鉛會司鐵市面、近日來頗現堅狀、因本街製罐廠·印刷廠等、進意不懈、市况亦熱鬧、故同業人心高昂、行情扳持甚堅、昨每箱二百磅開三百七十元、比前好起五六元不等、聞咋市全日成交約一百四五十箱光景、唯因是貨海外來源不繼、兼之本埠存底有限、因之執貨者心思益見挺勃、且躉批之巨數交易、大有不肯輕易脫手之感、</p>
<h3>雜項　肥皂高漲不已</h3>
<p>肥皂漲風、勢如破竹、投機囤戶各方仍不遺餘力、競購搜藏、致價迭漲不已、刻市做開、如固本皂小沙渡路出品每箱巳售至五十九元、白祥茂皂每箱五十二元、黃祥茂皂每箱四十八元、箭　皂每箱四十六元、均較上週復漲甚烈、投機人心頗濃、尙在看漲、</p>

<h3>統籌民食抑平市價　港米售價已決定　米號發售每石一百十元　米行直接定貨已受限制　當局統制全市米糧計劃漸具體化</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局採辦香港康價洋米、頃已完全接洽就緒、首批五千噸刻已由港啟運、日內即可抵埠、昨向工部局探悉、該項洋米售價業已由當局規定、爲（一）工部局售與行家者、每包一百二十二元九角一分、（一）行家售與號家者、每包一百三十三元五角、（三）米號售與市民者、每石一百十元、據悉行號所得利潤爲百分之五至十、凡行家向工部局認購時、須先付定洋三成、待米糧到埠交貨、即完全付足、聞米行之前往登記認銷者、頗不乏其人、又悉法當局所成交之大宗廉價洋米、首批已於安南啟運、尙無扺埠確期、</p>
<p>香港來米　品質殊佳</p>
<p>洋米有頭二號西貢及大小絞之別、貢米較佳、但小絞米亦頗堪食用、惟粒頭較碎而已、此次兩租界市政當局、已公布從香港與越南運來大批紋米可於兩週內扺滬、而以每石一百　元之代價出售、但上海米價頭號貢米仍須售一百五十五元、蓋投機米商尙在觀望、察其用意、須俟此項米糧確已到滬、始肯俯首就範、兩租界市民、於已往兩天內、巳停向零售店購買高價米糧、但隨糴隨食之苦力平民、受累不淺、故家有餘粒者、暫勿購米、亦足以戢米蠶之兇燄、</p>
<p>籌雇輪隻　最為重要</p>
<p>英文大美晚報社評云、工部局向香港運米來滬之計劃、獲得必要之船隻而能實行、誠爲對投機牟利者之一大打擊、目下本市食米並不缺乏、唯一之癥結在於廉價之食米不可得耳、造成此種悄形之罪魁、爲大批囤積居奇意圖牟利之徒、工部局若果能運米來滬、並統制米價使其保持合理之水準、則目下囤積在棧之米、均將出籠創價求售、蓋工部局所經手之米、每石售價一百十元、然則無論何人決不願向投機者購買每石一百五十元之米、且投機者雖以每石一百十元之價出售其所囤售之米、實仍有利可圖、亦必樂於脫售、則上海之米價、必跌至合理之水準矣、又局力此次規定經港轉滬米糧、在二千九百噸以上者、概須由工部局統購統銷、港政府不再簽發許可　、此點極爲重要、足使米商概受節制、不能再有法外活動、</p>
<p>米蠹氣燄　昨始歛跡</p>
<p>米市塲同業買賣、自經市塲管理委員會採取緊急措置後、顯已無法活躍、非法交易已漸吿絕跡、各米行號客在塲成交米糧、現已一律由買賣雙方出立成進出單、然後由代爲居間成交之米糧掮客持單赴「公正處」要求蓋印、昨晨市塲買賣在多方面嚴密監視之下、投機似感技窮、衆以廉價米運滬後、恐米價劇跌、爰將囤貨次第供應市塲、其時現貨籌碼稍增、加以米號納胃轉疲、結果卒較前市價跌　四元左右、</p>
<p>掮客舉動　頗堪注意</p>
<p>米糧掮客聯誼社昨公吿米市塲云、一查社員在營業時間、必須懸掛證章買賣成交、尤應領用本社居間成條、早經規定在案、際茲米價騰漲時期、社員暫時改爲逐日輪流半數入塲居間、並須將雜糧公會證件繳存本社、藉以杜絕下午交易、希於每日上午九時半至十時繳出雜糧公會證件、領取本社證章、十一時後卽將原證繳還、逾時不候作爲自棄論、又繕發第三十五號通吿云、刻查社員生活程度日高、買賣佣金自　遞升、定爲每包國幣一角、所有非社員、限一星期內來社報名加入、領取證章、入塲居間、據悉現在米市塲代行號客居間之掮客、巳達百一餘人、並皆係掮客聯誼社社員、入塲時咸持由該社證章、惟今市塲人數、巳感人滿之息、而該社竟猶徵集非社員入社、殊難索解、</p>
<p>麺粉運滬　六十萬包</p>
<p>上海麵粉食糧、以美國貨輪之繼續由美國各地裝運來滬、所供不虞匱乏、本月二日、有美國貨輪勞根倍去（譯音）號、復自　船載來麵粉計四十萬包、據美方航業公司稱、下星期內另有美貨輪名美　號者、將冉載來麵粉二十五萬包、供給滬市行商、該上述兩貨輪、均於十月由西雅圖駛來上海、此後該貨輪仍行駛歐亞美國間、載運麵粉與其他貨物、上海工部局對於平售麵粉、賡續責令麵粉行商推行、並應减低粉價、以重民生、</p>

<h3>五敎實踐一致性</h3>
<p>融五講經社第十四次講經，由孫翔仲君講儒釋道耶回五敎實踐一致性，經社員介紹孫君歷史後，即開講云：世界有無數宗敎，舉其大者，則爲儒·釋·道·耶·回·世入於各宗敎具有融合之心者，每謂各它敎之精神相同，何以事實之表現，大爲相異？委細硏究，則知凡一敎之興，各有其時地，古哲爲救世渡人而立敎，故必注重於當日之人情風俗，各時代之人情風俗不同，因此各敎之規律亦互異。然各敎之互異處，即各敎之特長處，亦即其對於當世有所補救處。</p>
<p>各宗敎規律，旣不相同，就其顯異處而言，誠若難於溝通。然今茲講宗敎之可以融通者，乃追溯其源頭之基本性而言，惟說到基本性，究竟如何方圓長短，有未可以測度者，於是究竟歸之於不可說不可說，旣曰不可說，則已不能再有名相，到底敎亦不存，更不煩再講融通矣。此是追求宗性，脫離現實，自然走到出世之路者。</p>
<p>體認宗敎須兩端並重，而尤須求古聖入居中運用之道。宗敎基礎，一本於性分源頭，儒大天，釋之眞如，道之自然，耶之上布，回之眞宰，是爲上截之一端。宗敎目的，以博愛人類爲對象。儒之欲明明德於天下，釋之以大悲爲本，道之貴以身爲天下，耶之我來役於人，回之以現世爲來世之田園，是爲下戴之一端。所貴乎居中運用者，即在以實踐貫通乎上下，性相圓融，應事不忘失乎其性，存性不忘失乎英事，身心道藝，一臨加功，此即爲實踐之一致性。</p>
<p>大道無所不在，事理本是不二，徒以人之意見阻塞其閒，則每每各走極端，執於理而頑空，拘於事而滯跡，事無理不相繩，遂致與道乖違，愈趨愈遠，乃造成世間絕大之苦境。</p>
<p>茲欲挽救此大苦之世界，則有一先決條件；條件謂何，即須重視人道，人而求合乎道，須講求全其人性，盡力於入事，因之運用各大宗敎已成之方案，而有以達其目的。目的有大小先後，故運用方案，亦隨之而有大小先後。習宗敎而能會通其本要不執宗敎之跡，以規律之異而相與牴觸，且應時而廣採新方案，以古今學術道藝，冶爲一爐，孰中孰從，相與爲用，由宗敎而孕育各科學，庶足以養成人類善全之文明，而各敎所懸之鵠的，所謂大同極樂天國等等，乃隨在而得實現矣。</p>
<p>至於運用各敎方案之階段，當然有其近景與遠景。就人類切要言之，高而至遠者，在推極本原以得性天合一，杳冥無跡，等千古於一息。廣而至近者，在彌綸現世以謀人我合一，推行周遍，合萬國爲一體，而其運用之樞要，尤在先得身心之合一。心有中宰，方足以闔闢萬象，息息不窮。身心如何合一，須堅守戒約，錘鍊習氣，歸於純凈。人我如何台一，須廣推愛心，眞無我而後眞有人。性天如何合一，須忘己而兼忘乎物，自得一片神行。是數者方法絕異，功夫至不同，然而滴滴歸源，則皆爲合於人道；必如是，乃眞爲貫通各敎精神，乃眞爲體得各敎實踐一致性。區區意見，未敢云是，敬請當世高明，加以指敎！</p>
<p>其第十三次傳統先君所講之儒釋道耶回基本一致性，早有印刷品宣布矣。</p>

<h3>糾正求學的態度</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>有許多小朋友，常常問自己：『怎樣才能使我的學問有不斷的進步？』今天我就相根據這個問題發表一點個人的意見；第一句話我要說的是各位所抱求學的態度，大都還沒有走上正軌，現在不妨先提出幾點來談談。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們讀醫是爲了求自己的知識，抑是爲了父母或師長而讀？你們當然不會回答我爲了父母或師長而讀；那麽爲什麽平日不受父母的催促或師長的督察，自己就不肯拿起書本來念呢？當然這種孩子，也有可是究屬少數吧。</p>
<p>第二點應該糾正的是求學問時絕對不可抱怕羞的態度，我曾經看到幾位小學生，他們在課堂上向先生發問書本上的問題，亦是羞答答的，一句不能接一句似的，我眞不懂他們所以怕羞的原因，怕羞的結果準會影響到他們學業的成績的！</p>
<p>現當春天，小朋友們不是喜歡放風箏的麽？風笋放得愈高，你們就愈高興，各位小朋友！求學問正就是放風箏呀！學了算術有代數，學了代數有三角…多學一分多知道一分，求學決不可學得了幾分就滿足：學校中常有一種現象，高班的學生往往認爲自己的學問已經豐富了，所以輕視低班的同學！這種學生總會有一天自己是錯誤了！</p>
<p>把求學的態度糾正了，如肯用功，學問是一定會有不斷的進步的！希望小朋友大家努力吧！</p>
<h3>做筆記</h3>
<p>— 銀化</p>
<p>級長從外面跑進來，對同學說：「今天國文敎師李先生因爲家中有事，不能上課，大家靜靜的自修吧」！這時，多數的同學果眞低下頭開始念書或寫字了，可是，有幾個頑皮的同學却就此吵鬧或怪叫起來了，級長感到一陣難堪，幸虧他急裏生智，過片刻他對大家提議道：「呵，同學們！我想起了，潘小娟同學不是我們全級中最用功，成績最優良的一個嗎？每個敎師不是都稱讚伊的嗎？那我們不是可利用這時問，請伊講講，伊念書的方法嗎？各位同學以爲如何」？話還未講完，一片讚成的呼聲，立刻爆發了起來，全級同學的目光都集中在小娟的身上，看伊的表示如何。</p>
<p>當然，伊是嬌羞了，紅着臉不肯起來，附近的同學有的向伊招招手，有的向伊眨貶眼伸伸舌，都要伊快些上去，結果，終於被鄰坐的　英拖了起來，不得不往台上走去。</p>
<p>伊一到台上，却不再忸怩了，沉着臉開始說了，口齒是怪響亮的。</p>
<p>「我很感激各位讚我學業的進步，而要我說些念書的方法，其實我也是並不十分用功的，我所採取的方法也不過是李先生過去說過的「做筆記」，的確，做筆記的效力是够大的，尤其能幫助我們的記憶！……</p>
<p>「唔，我們不能否認，先生在上課講的零碎而重要的辭，字，句……等等的東西，我們所記牢的，總要打一個很大的折扣，這時，我們就要用到「筆記」了，一方面可以集中我們的注意力，一方面更增强我們的記憶和印象，換句話說，效力要大上好幾倍呢！</p>
<p>「至於記的方法，那更容易而且廣泛了，因爲筆記是隨時隨地的工作，當先生在講的時候，那些疑難的，新鮮的語詞，句子，字眼，或古典的叙述，我們作文時容易患毛病的地方，……以及其他許多許多不容易記憶的東西，都是很好的筆記的材料。</p>
<p>「當你回家之後，你就可以整理一下，或者再翻一翻字典，再加上一些註釋，讀音。最後再作一次愼細的推敲和思索……這樣，你所得到的當然是很豐富很完美的了，於是，當你在作文的時候，你可以很寫意的應用，進步也當然快了！……</p>
<p>「最後還有一句話，就是說：這　做筆記的習慣的養成，是需要很大的毅力和忍耐的」！</p>
<p>方才瞎鬧的同學，也都會意地點點頭。</p>
<h3>幻想</h3>
<p>— 文涯</p>
<p>從前，有一個鄉下女兒，家中非常窮苦，因此她投到牛乳公司裏去工作——替他們搾牛乳，伊做工很勤愼，所以，公司的主人也就常常稱讚伊。</p>
<p>一天，公司裏的女主人賞給伊一桶牛乳，對伊說：「你可以把這桶牛乳賣掉了，得到了錢，去買些你所需要的東西罷。」這女孩聽了很是快活，於是連忙謝了女主人，把牛乳桶頂在頭上，洋洋得意的走向鎮上去。</p>
<p>在路上，伊一路微笑着，心上想道：「我是一個多麽幸運的女孩子呵！我將要把這桶牛乳賣掉了，去買幾個雞蛋回來。回來後向女主人借一隻母雞，把雞蛋放在伊的身子下面，使伊孵蛋；我想：女主人一定是允許我的。那不久母雞就會孵出一羣玲瓏可愛的小雞來，我就把他們飼養起來，等到一年之後，他們都巳長成得很肥很大了；那時，我賣掉他們，一定得到更多的錢呢！然後，我去買一件美麗的衣服，並且一定要用綠綢做的。是啊！我有了這件綠綢的新衣裳，再配上新帽兒，新鞋子，那我將變成一個漂亮的小姐了！那時，我比上農塲上的女孩子們要高貴而華麗得多，當我走近伊們的時候，我再也不去望伊們一眼，倘伊們對我談話，我也不再去回答一句了。我將挺起胸膛，搖搖我的頭——像這個樣兒。哈……」這女郎一想到搖頭，果眞把頭搖了幾搖，冷不防伊頭上的牛乳桶，經伊這樣一搖以後，立即翻了下來；一桶牛乳也全都潑在地上了；於是，伊站在路旁放聲大哭起來。心頭的幻想也隨之消失了。</p>
<h3>植物能够感覺嗎</h3>
<p>— 燁爍</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！假使我問你們：「植物能够感覺嗎？」我想你們一定要回答我說：「不，不能够的，植物旣沒有腦，又沒有神經中樞，怎樣可以和動物一樣的能够感覺呢？」</p>
<p>但是，小朋友們！你們的回答確是錯了，要知道，有些植物是具有一種特殊的細胞，而能够感覺外來的刺激和震動。</p>
<p>在巴西地方有一種叫含羞草的植物，假使你對它吹一口氣或用手指觸一下，它便立刻歛起了葉片，垂下來好像一個人害羞時低下頭一樣，所以人們都稱它叫含羞草。</p>
<p>除了含羞草外，還有一種叫伏牛花，它的雄蕊感覺異常敏銳，只要輕輕的碰它一碰，它的雄蕊使立刻會收攏來。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們覺得這兩種植物奇怪嗎？你們要不要看一次？伏牛花雖不易見，而含羞草在上海，却也可以看到的。</p>
<h3>石膏模型的兩種造法</h3>
<p>— 堃</p>
<p>小林在學校裏看見同學們，大都有石膏模型，他們用蠟澆出一個個的小貓，白雪公主，七矮人，……不由地生出一種羨慕心來了，他就要求爸爸給他買一隻。他的哥哥大林聽見了，挿嘴說：「我給你做一隻罷！」原來，他曾經學過模型的製法，小林本來的慾望只是一隻模型，現在，見哥哥答應給他造一隻，就快樂得很。於是大林就去買原料—石膏粉和一隻賽　珞的玩具。回來時，把石膏粉放在鍋裏炒了一會，把它傾出；再找一隻適中的紙盒。</p>
<p>一切東西齊備好了，大林就開始做，只見他先把那隻賽璐珞玩具，塗上一層薄薄的凡士林，再把石膏粉用水調成漿狀（不稀也不濃），倒進盒裏，把那塗有油的玩具半面放下去；一刹那，石膏模型一半已成了，他就把它取出，修整一下，在旁邊用小刀挖去一塊方形的石膏。</p>
<p>小林看得呆了，可是他不明白石膏粉爲甚麽要炒？玩具上爲甚麽要塗油？又爲甚麽要在模型的一邊挖去方形的一塊？終於迫不及待的問起哥哥來了。</p>
<p>大林答應了，就一面又把一些石膏粉，倒入盒內；一面解釋給他聽：「因爲我買的是生石膏粉，裏面還含有一部份水分，把它炒一炒，水分就蒸發出來，成熟石膏粉。經過了這一步驟，做模型的時候，乾也乾得快；玩具上塗油可防石膏黏着，而不能把它取出；至於模型的半面爲甚麽挖去一塊和修整呢？因爲，這樣可使模型更吻合；澆出來的蠟像也更逼眞了。此時，石膏模型已成了。玩具也取出來了。石膏粉剩下很多，大林就把玩具用刀破開，也把凡士林塗在裏面，再開些石膏粉，倒進去，待它半乾，把兩面合上，揑緊，乾後，把玩具除下，一隻雪白的石膏模型就呈在眼前了。大林把它們交給弟弟。小林捧着這兩個模型，歡天喜地的跑開了。</p>
<h3>買平飯的窮人</h3>
<p>— 石子</p>
<p>中午，明兒　了書包回家，他一跳一躍的跑着；當他走到馬路轉角的時候，有許多衣衫襤褸的窮人，好像學校上體操課一樣的，排着隊，不過他們的手中，都拿着一隻破袋，或者是破籃。有老太婆，也有女小孩，有長的，有短的，却不像學校裏操體操那樣，要長短排得整齊。明兒覺得很奇怪，他留心地跟着那奇怪的隊伍看過去，至轉角那邊，牆壁上貼着一張白紙，上面寫着：「發售平飯」四個大字。明兒以爲這是賣飯的店，但買飯爲什麽要排隊？明兒又不懂了！他決定去問哥哥去，於是他很快的跑到家裏去。</p>
<p>昭兒也剛放學歸來，他看見明兒急急的跑進來，拉住了他的手臂說：「哥哥，我放學回來，看見馬路上有許多窮人，排着隊在飯店裏買飯，買飯也要排隊嗎？」</p>
<p>昭兒放學回家，也時常經過那地方，所以他一聽就明白了，他叫明兒把手放了，和善地說：「這是買「平飯」的地方，不是飯店。……」</p>
<p>「「平飯」，對呀！我看見牆上貼着：「發售平飯」的紙條。」明兒高興地說着。</p>
<p>「但是你不知道「平飯」是什麽意思，所以把他弄錯了是「飯店」。「平飯」就是價錢很賤的飯，這是一班慈善家，看着如此高的米價，窮人實在活不下去了，他們就生了好心，煮好了白米飯，叫窮人來買，價錢又比別處便宜得多。所以普通飯店裏的飯，要買二角一碗，這「平飯處」化一角錢，就可以買到一磅飯。因爲辦這「平飯處」的人，是存心救濟窮人，不但不在飯上賺錢，恐怕還要虧本呢。」</p>
<p>昭兒說到這裏，母親來喊吃午飯了，兩兄弟就挽着手，到客堂裏吃飯。昭兒托着一碗滿滿的白飯，對着明兒說：「弟弟，我們每大吃着現成的白米飯，就不知道有許多窮人在吃「平飯」；更有許多窮人沒飯吃，餓死在街頭呢。」</p>
<p>明兒點了點頭，表示同意他哥哥的話。母親看了很奇怪，問他們說什麽？昭兒就把明兒所見的，吿訴了母親，母親不由得也莊重地說：「好孩子，你們能關心窮人的生活，是不錯的；不過這「平飯」還是要用錢去買，有許多沒錢的窮人；就祗有餓死的一路。所以耍澈底的救濟窮人，就是要使每個窮人，都有够輞「平飯」的錢；這些錢就要每個有良心的人，佈施給窮人了。」</p>
<p>昭兒，明兒靜靜地聽完了母親的話，明兒不聲不響地把手插到褲袋裏，摸出了一元的鈔票，交到母親的面前，誠懇地說：「媽，我不願再用你的錢，去買糖果吃了。這一元錢，請你給弄堂裏的那江北孩子吧，我有次見他吞着糠呢。」</p>
<p>昭兒也摸出了母親給他的一元錢，交給了母親，一面對着明兒說：「弟弟，我們不但要今天如此做，並且要每天如此做。」</p>
<p>母親溫和地接着說：「對呀，你們要天天念着窮人，不要做一個自私自利的人才對！」</p>

<h3>關戲</h3>
<p>— 君</p>
<p>淸季禁演關戲，故雖鬚生人才輩出，而以關戲著稱者，則亦僅米喜子程長庚數人而巳。當時京曲簡陋，專尙唱工，米程演此，初屬搭演性質，非專有此紅生一工也。故老相傳，演關戲最早者，當推于四勝，于，安徽石埭人，初至故都，隸春台班，絀于喉，無籍籍名，而荒腔走板，每唱必砸，尋遂賦閒，輙思所以邀譽之道，未幾，忽復投春台，詣班主所，請再出演，詰以戲目，則以戰長沙對，班主憐其遇，許之，至日，觀者大集，四勝在後台初不開臉，但取酒痛飲數十觥，無醉意，及台簾一揭，四　橫刀而出，運氣上升，顏如赤虹，威嚴肅穆，神采奕奕，觀者竟爲此先聲所奪，咸大稱賞，于是唱做念打，亦居然頭頭是道，迴不若往日之意懶心灰矣。自此四勝遂一唱而紅，時程長庚在三慶，耳四勝名，大異，微服往觀，歸而嗤之曰：「是豈眞技藝哉！不過天生硃砂臉耳。」翌日，長庚亦貼戰長沙，硏墨和硃，悉心描畫，開臉之美，無與倫比，比及演出，唱做尤卓絕，觀衆前之盛譽四勝者，至是遂無不盡道長庚「老爺戲」爲佳奏矣。關戲亦自此京劇中占一席地，溯源推始，關戲之創作者，最早實爲于四勝也。</p>
<p>長庚旣以演關戲著，然格於禁例，不敢常演，晚年曾與遲遇泉合演戰長沙於天和館，事後，爲都御史所傳訊，時長庚爲伶界山斗，聲望極重，不得已遂由其徒徐阿妮扶持前往，由阿妮代笞五板，始寢其事。亦可見當時演關戲禁令之嚴矣。此事今日知者巳絕鮮，倘亦關戲珍屑歟。</p>
<p>關戲於淸季旣禁令森嚴，故演此者亦往往不求深造，降及時伶，不失諸瘟，便失之野，欲求全材，渺不可得，楊老將晚年曾一度與郝壽臣排演封金挑袍，郝以演曹操馳譽，而老將之關羽，則尙屬新鋼初試，比出塲，老將神氣浩然，不瘟不火，於關羽崛强性格，宜洩殆盡，即其開臉念白，亦妙造自然，絕少雕琢氣與偶象氣，以視郝之曹瞞，轉覺有刻劃跡象矣。老將左右以楊之關戲爲絕唱，進言可一而不可再，遂不復再演，否則楊派關戲，當可壓倒汪派，王派，景派，彭派，今之唱關戲各派矣。</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒　最近生活寫眞</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>去年此日，好萊塢盛傳秀蘭鄧波兒有脫離銀幕之意。但現在，已證明了不確。因爲繼「靑鳥」一片之後，她繼續在拍片，而最近米高梅或雷電華，都有向廿世紀—福斯借用秀蘭鄧波兒之說。更證明了至少暫時這顆童星還不脫離銀幕。這裏，把秀蘭鄧波兒繼續拍片的原因，寫些出來，爲讀者報導一下。</p>
<p>從影九年</p>
<p>她三歲就上銀幕，到今年四月二十三日為止，她是十足的十二歲了。在這九年之中，她主演了不少影片，而且每一部都有相當的叫座力。所以不但她自己賺了巨網薪金，更爲廿世紀—福斯賺了好多錢呢　有過一時，影片公司曾把她當過搖錢樹，她主演的影片，本輕利重，是穩可賺錢的。</p>
<p>準備隱退</p>
<p>童星的時期，本來很短促，十二歲的孩子，不久將失去童星的資格了。尤其秀蘭鄧波兒是一個早熟的女孩子，看去好像十四五歲的少女了，所以她的母親，去年曾決定使秀蘭鄧波兒不再拍戲，離開銀幕。這樣好讓她再去讀幾年書，以求日後的出路。</p>
<p>打消計劃</p>
<p>但自此項消息傳出後，廿世紀—福斯就首先表示挽留，要求秀蘭鄧波兒再拍幾部影片。同時，各地的影迷，也紛紛的寫信給她母親和影片公司，希望秀蘭鄧波兒繼續拍片，在這種情形之下，所　盛情難却，鄧波兒夫人祇得把計劃打消。</p>
<p>爭相借用</p>
<p>因此，秀蘭鄧波兒直到現在，還在拍片，而且最近她所主演的片子，還是能受人歡迎。至於賣座紀錄的低减，原是受了戰事影響。最近米高梅和雷電華，在計劃拍攝PanamaHattle一片，由那一家拍攝確定之後，據說要借用秀蘭鄧波兒擔任此片的童角。</p>

<h3>Pro-German and Anti-British Iraq: Near East War Suddenly Erupts; Iraqi Troops Occupy Important Strongholds and Cut Off Oil Pipelines; Fierce Fighting with British Forces Near Habbaniyah</h3>
<p>London: Germany has opened a new battlefield on the path from Berlin to expanding its territory towards Baghdad. At dawn yesterday, pro-Nazi Iraqi troops shelled the British-held Habbaniyah airfield and began fighting with British forces. It is reported that Iraqi forces have occupied important British oilfields and transportation hubs. Iraqi Prime Minister al-Gaylani has appealed to Hitler, asking him to drive out the British. It is noted that in 1915, British forces suffered a major defeat in the conquest of Baghdad, and were bitterly besieged. Habbaniyah is 65 miles west of Baghdad and is an important base for British air patrols over the Mosul oilfields (which are vital to Britain). The shelling of the British airfield began on Thursday. Iraq has been implementing a compulsory military service system for those aged 19 to 25 since 1936. (United Press report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Responsible officials have received reports on the events of yesterday's Iraqi army attack on the Habbaniyah airfield, stating that Iraqi forces first set up a警戒 line around the airfield and dug trenches on high ground, and then opened fire on the British Air Force. The British immediately retaliated against the Iraqi artillery positions, hitting several of their positions with bombs. The fighting is continuing. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul: It was learned here today that the oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa, which passes through Iraq and Palestine and is dedicated to transporting crude oil to the British Mediterranean Fleet, has now been cut by Iraqi troops. (Haitong report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: British and Iraqi forces have engaged in battle near Habbaniyah, the site of an important British airfield. An official British statement said that British forces took necessary responsive actions yesterday after Iraqi troops opened fire first. The fighting has not stopped all day and is still ongoing. The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast in Arabic yesterday afternoon, calling on the Iraqi people to drive out the current government. According to London, Iraqi troops concentrated around Habbaniyah, leading to unfortunate clashes with the British troops stationed there. The Iraqi government not only ignored the request to withdraw its troops, but also reinforced its forces on Thursday. Yesterday morning, Iraqi troops opened fire on the British camp, forcing the British troops to counterattack. It is noted that after Gaylani seized power by force a month ago with the support of army leaders, he publicly announced his intention to respect the Anglo-Iraqi treaty. The British government informed him of its intention to open a transportation line in Iraq to transport British troops in accordance with the agreement reached with Iraq a year ago. Gaylani had no objection at the time, and a batch of British troops landed in Basra without encountering resistance. However, a few days later, when the British informed Iraq that another batch of troops was heading to Basra, the Iraqi authorities suddenly claimed that the British troops who had already arrived had not yet crossed the border and that they were unwilling to allow the subsequent batch of British troops to continue entering Iraqi territory. The British insisted on their treaty rights and still sent troops to land in Basra. After that, Iraqi troops concentrated around Habbaniyah in a threatening manner, and the local Iraqi commander sent a strongly worded letter to the British commander in Habbaniyah, stating that no aircraft or troops were allowed to move from Habbaniyah, otherwise they would be shelled. The British ambassador to Iraq negotiated with Gaylani to withdraw Iraqi troops, but to no avail. There is now reason to believe that the majority of the Iraqi people do not approve of Gaylani's anti-British policy and welcome the restoration of the original friendly relations between the two countries. Iraq is rich in oil resources, with pipelines to the Mediterranean. In 1938, it produced 4,272,000 tons of oil. The country has an area of 116,600 square miles. The population was surveyed in 1935 to be just over 3.5 million. In 1932, British trusteeship ended, and Iraq joined the League of Nations as a member. The army was formed in 1938, with a total of 28,000 men, including the air force. There were approximately 10,339 police officers. The king is Faisal II, who is only six years old. He succeeded to the throne in 1939 and is under the regency of his uncle, Ilah. Last month, National Party leader Gaylani launched a coup to seize power, and Regent Ilah fled to Transjordan. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul: The Iraqi capital's radio station broadcast an important message, calling on the Arabs of Palestine to assist Iraq, arguing that when Arabs in any location fight for freedom, they are fighting for Arabs everywhere. (Haitong report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Iraqi Statement of Battle Report</p>
<p>Iraqi Capital: The government issued a communiqué this morning, stating that our troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the British army, and the situation is in our favor. On the western front, our troops have occupied several oil wells, destroyed many depots and ammunition depots, and surrounded the Sinai Tabana airfield. The British have suffered heavy casualties. On the northern front, our troops have controlled all oil pipelines and the Kirkuk, Rani King, and Gaia Yala oilfields and their refineries. On the southern front, artillery battles have also occurred. In addition, our aircraft bombed the Haniyah airfield last night, hitting oil depots and aircraft hangars. British aircraft also bombed the Rachit barracks near the capital this morning, but we suffered no losses. (Havas report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: According to the Italian official news agency, the Ali government of Nada issued a communiqué stating that British motorized units had attempted to occupy a desert airfield and outposts in the Rutba area of eastern Iraq, but were repelled. Rutba is a grassland in the Syrian desert, about 230 miles east of Baghdad, and is an important outpost on the land and air route from Palestine to Iraq.</p>
<p>According to a Jerusalem dispatch received in London, Arab人士 in Palestine have been listening to broadcasts from a self-proclaimed Baghdad radio station, which gave vivid descriptions of the Iraqi military situation and claimed that disturbances had occurred in Palestine. However, since the residents of Palestine knew that there were no disturbances, they laughed off and disbelieved other news broadcast by the radio station. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Begs for Assistance from Berlin; Goes to the Front Lines to Personally Supervise the Battle</p>
<p>London: The British Broadcasting Corporation recently broadcast a message stating that after Iraqi artillery shelled the Habbaniyah area, Prime Minister Gaylani has requested military assistance from Germany to oppose Britain. As for the British women and children in Iraq, they are being escorted by Iraqi guards to Habbaniyah. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul: News came from Baghdad this morning that Iraqi Prime Minister Ali-Gaylani has gone to the front lines to supervise the battle. (Haitong report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, the Iraqi army seemed to be holding its ground, waiting for German reinforcements to arrive from Syria. British forces will take decisive and swift action, and may attack Baghdad. It is believed that Iraqi Prime Minister al-Gaylani is relying on German reinforcements arriving from Syria. The Germans have supported the Syrian Nationalist movement in Syria. Observers do not believe that Italy will transport reinforcements by sea, which would be attacked by the British Navy, but will only transport reinforcements by air from Syria. (United Press report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Germany currently has no diplomatic relations with Iraq, but the German people sympathize with the Iraqi people's fight for freedom. As for the outside rumors that Iraq has requested assistance from Germany, I cannot comment. (Haitong report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Beirut: Iraqi Defense Minister Haffonda said that conscripts of the 1923 class are enthusiastically enlisting in the army, which is a historical first for Iraq. Nomads and Bedouins have also enlisted. (Haitong report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>New York: The National Broadcasting Company here received a German broadcast yesterday, stating that all levels of special reserves in Iraq have been called up, and political prisoners have been granted amnesty. The Iraqi army has also garrisoned all key military locations, including Basra. It also claimed that Iraqi youth groups held demonstrations in front of Prime Minister al-Gaylani's residence. The Prime Minister declared, "The Iraqi government has made its best efforts to ensure the country continues to be peaceful." (United Press report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Effective British Response to Various Slanders Against Iraq</p>
<p>London: According to news here, the British government has already prepared plans to deal with any interference with the oil pipelines in Iraq. The claim that any part of the oil pipeline has been occupied has not been confirmed here. It is reported that the status of the Iraqi embassy in Britain is not affected. According to a Rome radio broadcast, the government led by Ali issued a statement stating that the Iraqi authorities had made every effort to avoid accidents, but the British government's political behavior was incompatible with the treaty. The statement also accused Britain of provoking Iraq, and that British troops fired on Iraqi troops, who had no choice but to retaliate. British officials have made an effective response to the above-mentioned slanders in broadcasts to Iraq, pointing out that Ali declared that he would act in accordance with the treaty, while at the same time requesting military assistance from Berlin. Britain had no choice but to take countermeasures. The British communiqué also urged the Iraqi people to overthrow the regime led by Ali. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Britain Announces Blockade of the Persian Gulf; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Transported to Basra</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced that all neutral countries outside Europe transporting goods by sea to Iran, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf will now be required to obtain a naval permit. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Beirut: According to news from the seaport of the Palestinian Mandate, five British troop transport ships loaded with large quantities of firearms and ammunition arrived there on April 27 and unloaded the goods. However, on May 1, they were ordered to immediately transport the firearms and ammunition to the port of Basra in Iraq. (Havas report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Beirut: Several British troop transport ships arrived at the port of Haifa yesterday, and 3,000 British soldiers landed. Some British soldiers also traveled from Transjordan to Iraq. (Haitong report on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After the Outbreak of War in the Near East</h3>
<p>Just as the war in the Balkans was about to end, the disasters of war in the Near East unexpectedly broke out yesterday: Under the command of the new anti-British government, Iraqi troops actually shelled the British air force base in Habbaniyah, leading to fierce fighting between the two sides. It is widely rumored that Iraqi troops have occupied the airfield, key transportation points, and oil areas. At the same time, Iraqi Prime Minister Gaylani is said to have requested assistance from Berlin. Regardless of whether the German side will provide assistance or how it will do so, the British army's urgent task is obviously to quickly resolve the tens of thousands of Iraqi troops before German assistance arrives, so as to prevent a small spark from becoming a prairie fire. Therefore, in the next few days, the British army must use the most agile posture to unleash its supreme power to eliminate this army that once received its support but has now turned against it. If it does not, the future evolution of Asia Minor will inevitably add great trouble to Britain.</p>
<p>Investigating the inside story of Iraq's sudden turn, although it inevitably involves some political, ethnic, and even economic unrest left over from past British colonial policies, the incitement and secret assistance of Axis members is undoubtedly the main driving force. As early as the day of the coup in Iraq on May 3, people were alerted to the fact that the fifth column that Hitler had deployed in the Near East had already played a preliminary role. When the British military authorities were very stretched in the Balkan and African wars a few days ago, they suddenly sent troops to land at the port of Basra, probably because they had received secret reports and had to prepare in advance. However, the British troops had not landed for long, and the number was still limited. This time, they were caught off guard and inevitably suffered the disadvantage of "being taken advantage of." Fortunately, General Wavell, the British commander in the Middle East, is an outstanding general. In military terms, he must know how to deal with this not unexpected incident.</p>
<p>As for Germany, if she is determined to provide assistance, the first step can only be to assist in the war by aircraft. If she wants to send an expeditionary army, then the route issue will immediately arise. Assuming that troops are transported by troop ships from southern Greece to land in Syria, they will inevitably be attacked by the British fleet along the way. The difficulty and danger of this matter are exactly the same as the German army's inability to forcibly cross the English Channel. The most ideal solution, of course, is to pass through Turkey and go straight to the Mosul oilfields in northern Iraq. If Germany can gain a foothold in Iraq in the future, not only will Syria be like a turtle in a jar, but Palestine and other places will also fall into its clutches one by one. Finally, it will not be difficult to seize the Suez Canal in one fell swoop to cut off Britain's lifeline in the Red Sea. However, the premise of all this is that the Turkish government is willing to be dominated by Germany, willing to provide the Dardanelles Strait area and even the entire country for the long-term intrusion of Nazi mechanized troops, and willing to abandon the foundation of independence that the late President Kemal had painstakingly built, so as to align itself with the ranks of Romania and Bulgaria. This kind of "concession" may temporarily be exchanged for some benefits (Germany may use Syria as a reward for Turkey's alliance), but what is the difference between this and Bulgaria's division of Macedonia and Hungary's occupation of northern Slovenia? I am afraid that before this "harvest" obtained without effort has been digested, the country's independent sovereignty and the nation's glorious freedom have already been ruined. Is this the fate that the Turkish nation is willing to accept?</p>
<p>In addition, there is an important factor that cannot be ignored, and that is the future direction of the Soviet Union's attitude. According to Japanese propaganda, the Soviet Union and Germany have secretly agreed to divide the Near East, just like the division of Poland last year. However, for the so-called division to be established, both parties must not have disputes over the allocation of the division object. For example, the Iraqi oilfields in question are closest to the Soviet Caucasus. If they are assigned to Germany in the future, Stalin may not be happy to hear it. Assuming that they are assigned to the Soviet Union, wouldn't Hitler be busy for nothing? In case Moscow does not wait for German reinforcements to arrive in Iraq, and takes the initiative by sending troops to Iran to control northern Iraq, and at the same time encourages Turkey to refuse the passage of German troops, then the Soviet-German conflict that the democratic countries have been looking forward to may be inevitable.</p>
<h3>London Attaches Great Importance to the Development of the Near East Situation</h3>
<p>London: Diplomatic and military commentators here now believe that British military leaders will deal with the situation in Iraq with strong measures, and warn that the seriousness of the military problem should not be underestimated. They also said that if yesterday's conflict was the prelude to a large-scale operation, Britain's resources in the Middle East will be exhausted. According to recent estimates, the Iraqi army has about 25,000 to 30,000 men, in addition to 12 artillery units, 45 aircraft, and some mechanized units. Their combat effectiveness is said to be ordinary. The British troops in the area, including the famous Gurkha and Sikh units, may be able to cope with the situation in Iraq without further reinforcements. However, diplomatic observers believe that many German officers or other Nazi soldiers have entered Iraq, or far more than Britain suspects. They also pointed out that Britain's important oil pipelines could be in great danger due to the actions of those who are reluctant to work, regardless of whether these reluctant workers are already in Iraq or transported to Iraq by aircraft taking off from the Dodecanese Islands. Commentators strongly stated that in addition to protecting Britain's oil sources, it is also necessary to restore Turkey's faith, and they believe that the British will take strong action to prevent the Germans from indirectly controlling Iraq. People here also fear that the Germans may take decisive action to destroy Iraq's important oil wells and transportation pipelines, or even risk sending a large number of aircraft to achieve this goal. It is reported that the Germans have hundreds of Junkers transport planes available. These aircraft can carry at least 20 soldiers in full gear or a corresponding weight of artillery. In addition, there are new types of giant aircraft that can carry tanks. It is reported that there are at least 100 of these transport aircraft in Libya, and it is also reported that there are some in Greece and the Balkans. The Germans may be prepared to sacrifice these aircraft to land in Iraq during combat, as they did in Norway and the Low Countries. (United Press report on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>To Defend Independence and Freedom, Turkey Does Not Hesitate to Fight; Determination Not to Abandon the Alliance with Britain; Clear Expression from Turkish Leaders; Nine Classes of Reservists Regularly Called Up for Enlistment</h3>
<p>Istanbul: "The Yani Sabah newspaper" carried news from the Axis that Turkey had revised its policy toward Britain. Turkish Senator Yalchin recently criticized this, saying that if Turkey is forced to fight for national glory, it will stand on the side of Britain, not because Britain has made this request, but because the ideas and interests of the two countries are the same. Turkey cannot deviate from its friendship and alliance with Britain and join another camp, because if Turkey does so, it would be tantamount to self-abandonment. (Reuters report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgaria predicted yesterday that Turkey would soon join the Axis countries as a friend. Turkish President Ismet recently held secret meetings with senior German diplomats in the Bulgarian capital.

<p>Berlin: German officials said that Ambassador von Papen to Turkey has returned to Ankara after returning home to report on the political situation in Turkey. (United Press report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: "The Roman People's News" recently carried a dispatch from a reporter stationed in the Balkan Peninsula, stating that Turkey will soon sign a treaty with the Axis countries. This can be seen from the fact that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen hurriedly returned to his post after returning home to report to Hitler, and that President Ismet went to inspect defenses in Anatolia and along the Mediterranean coast. However, although President Ismet and Chief of Staff General Chemak do not want Turkey to take any risks, they cannot tolerate any actions that endanger Turkey's interests. We believe that the actions recently taken by Turkish military leaders are of great significance. It is rumored that President Ismet's tour of various places was at the urging of military leaders, so as to prevent the President from feeling surrounded by external dangerous forces, but this so-called external force refers not only to Britain alone. Although the Turkish General Staff approves of negotiations with Germany, it cannot ignore its defense responsibilities due to its responsibilities. In addition, the evacuation of residents in some parts of Turkey has been ordered to stop, which can also be regarded as an important development in Turkey's political situation.

<h3>Sixty-Seven Japanese Aircraft Attack Suburbs of Chongqing; Two Hundred Incendiary and High Explosive Bombs Dropped; Five Fires Started, All Quickly Extinguished</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Forty-five Japanese aircraft attacked the modern suburbs of Chongqing today, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs, causing considerable damage, but few casualties. Two years ago, on May 3rd, Japanese aircraft also bombed Chongqing, killing five thousand people. The Japanese aircraft arrived over Chongqing at 12:20 PM, shortly after Captain Roosevelt, the eldest son of the U.S. President, had departed for Rangoon by plane. The Japanese aircraft arrived in two waves of twenty-seven and eighteen, concentrating their bombing on two square miles of the modern suburbs, starting five fires and destroying several houses, but the fires were extinguished within half an hour. Two years ago, also on May 3rd, a large number of Japanese aircraft attacked, and at that time Chongqing was not well prepared, with only a few air raid shelters, so the damage was quite severe, with no less than five thousand people killed, leaving obvious and distressing scars on Chongqing. Today, although the Japanese aircraft tried their best to replicate the destruction of two years ago, Chongqing suffered only minor damage. There are extensive and well-defended air raid shelters to accommodate those seeking refuge, so there were only very few casualties reported. The house near where Captain Roosevelt had been staying before his departure this morning was also bombed and caught fire. Captain Roosevelt left here at 10:10 AM, and the air raid alarm was issued at 11:00 AM and ended at 2:00 PM. Within 200 yards of the press dormitory, 40 bombs fell, shattering the windows and walls of the dormitory. Forty thatched huts 100 yards from the dormitory were also set on fire and burned to ashes within twenty minutes. Many 4-type bombs also fell in the shopping area, but the damage caused was relatively minor. Air defense officials said that 75 aircraft participated in the bombing, but observers on the south bank of the Jialing River said they saw 62 aircraft. It is said that about 83 bombers departed from the Japanese base in Hankou. Many bombs fell in areas that had been heavily bombed two years ago. It is reported that two guards at the entrance of a certain air raid shelter were killed. The office of the British Boxer Indemnity Committee was also destroyed. Although the press dormitory was damaged, American journalists still hosted U.S. Ambassador Johnson there tonight, and the restaurant catering the banquet was hit by a small bomb, but the banquet was not canceled. Less than an hour after the bombing ended, workers had already begun repairing the roads and tidying up the power lines, and were watering the bombed areas to prevent dust from flying. Small shops also reopened. Rescue teams also went out to look for the injured, but since they were unable to find any, there were more people playing around in the worst-hit area than those who were sad.

<h3>Talk of War Between Japan and the United States is Purely False; Japanese Newspaper Believes There are No Unsolvable Problems Between Japan and the United States</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Chugai Shogyo Shimpo" editorial today stated that there are currently no outstanding issues between Japan and the United States that cannot be resolved peacefully, but this does not mean that Japan-U.S. relations can be quickly adjusted, like Japan-Soviet relations. As for the talk of Japan-U.S. war, it is a dream. Those who make this claim are clearly [text missing - the word should be 'belligerent/warmongering'], because Americans still consider themselves protectors of [text missing - probably 'democratic'] countries. Americans refer to Chongqing as a democratic government, which is simply daydreaming. If [text missing - most likely 'Japan']'s government and people can break this dream, then the Japan-U.S. [text missing - probably 'problems'] can all be solved easily, without the need for Matsuoka to visit the U.S. or President Roosevelt to visit Japan.

Even pro-German French public law scholars believe that the power of the two admirals currently in Vichy, and U.S. Ambassador Admiral Leahy is actually exceeds that of French Associate Admiral Darlan. Germany is now pressing Marshal Pétain to take actions that he desperately wants to avoid. German opinions are also inconsistent; some advocate for the reinstatement of Laval, while others support Darlan's continued maintenance of the status quo. Political observers are deeply concerned that Darlan, in order to satisfy his personal ambitions, may be prepared to make even greater concessions to Germany than before in order to eliminate the possibility of Laval regaining power. France has so far handed over 140 German refugees in the non-occupied zone to Germany in accordance with the armistice agreement. (3rd dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Fire in Manila</h3>
<p>Manila: The commercial and residential district of Tondo in Manila is now a scene of ashes tonight. Since Manila's recorded history, there has never been such a great fire. It is estimated that 4,000 rows of houses were burned, 1,200 houses were destroyed, and the loss is 5 million Philippine pesos (approximately 47.5 million Shanghai dollars). At least three people have died, and lumberyards, warehouses, offices, and private residences have all become a plain. The fire burned for several hours. Manila's fire engines were all dispatched to try their best to put out the fire. The fire continued to spread this afternoon, and only subsided slightly at 8:00 PM. At 11:30 PM, the fire had been brought under control. Thousands of people have been made homeless by the fire, so the police are on alert near the burned area to prevent the public from hindering the work of the firefighters. The fire broke out at 2:38 PM and spread very quickly. According to the police and fire departments, they do not know the cause of the fire, but are investigating. After the fire in the Tondo area, the houses collapsed, and the smoke filled the sky, quite like the devastation of Plymouth after being attacked by heavy fire. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Change of Governors in Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: The outgoing Governor of Gibraltar, Lieutenant General Liddell, gave a farewell speech from his headquarters inside the tunnel last night, saying that Hitler had repeatedly tried to force Spain to join the war in order to attack Gibraltar and cut off the Strait. The Spanish people did not want war, but Hitler used his well-known tricks to recruit elements similar to "Quislings" in Spain. Therefore, Gibraltar must step up its preparations so that when the enemy attacks Gibraltar from the sea and land, we can annihilate them. The commander of the Gibraltar Fortress is now working at the War Headquarters, which is the first time since the Great Siege of 1779 to 1783, he said. Liddell spoke of Gibraltar's unbreakable defenses, saying that Hitler might as well send his mobs to try it. According to reports, Liddell's successor is General Gort, who once commanded the British army in France. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>The U.S. No Longer Hesitates to Participate in the European War: All Parties Agree That Aiding Britain Requires War</h3>
<p>Washington: The government is increasingly considering the possibility of participating in the war, believing that it is the only way to aid Britain. The idea of ​​aiding Britain by "avoiding war" seems to have become a thing of the past. Whether in public or private conversations, it is expressed that everything must be sacrificed to aid Britain. This sentiment is increasing, seemingly wanting the public to think that 40 years after the end of the First World War, the United States can fight Germany again. This movement to awaken the American people and make them aware of the seriousness of the situation is now developing rapidly, making the country truly prepared for war. Observers point out that any senior official who does not mention avoiding participating in the war to aid Britain has been doing so for a week. (International News Service Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the European War (50): A New Model of American Diplomat</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt's specially selected ambassador to Britain, Winant, is now undertaking one of the most important new roles as America's "overseas eyes and ears." He is not a career diplomat, nor does he rely on a diplomat's salary, and he gets along extremely well with the British officialdom. In these few points, he is no different from his predecessors. However, there are many differences.</p>
<p>For many years, Winant has worked hard to promote the orderly progress of civil society at home and abroad, so the British Liberal Party and Labour Party welcome him no less than the Conservative Party. He believes that today's foreign policy "cannot and should not be separated from social and economic policies." He believes that human happiness can only be achieved through friendly cooperation between countries, and only then can a world be created in the current chaotic international situation, "so that free people can live and work in peace with each other."</p>
<p>Therefore, he is not only a businessman but also a humanitarian. He wants to examine the important changes in British political life and philosophical evolution and report to the American government, so that the future world may gain a clue from this change.</p>
<p>Winant's origin can be said to be the most aristocratic in a democratic country. He came from an elegant colonial family and received the best higher education in his youth. He received an inheritance, and his property increased after his marriage. His hobbies are also what many people wish to keep for life.</p>
<p>He once taught history at St. Paul's School in Concord. He is fond of studying strategy, and he likes to excavate secret materials in American politics. He collects books, oil paintings, Arabian horses, and dogs, and he also loves gentlemanly farming.</p>
<p>Because of his poor eyesight, he was unable to enlist in the last World War, but he managed to join the French Air Force, transferred to the Allied forces, entered and exited the firing line, and took military photographs. When he returned to his country, he had been promoted to the rank of captain. His career has often changed, and he has achieved success in oil extraction, logging, mining, and business.</p>
<p>He could have engaged in these kinds of businesses, but he gave up this comfortable life early on to seek public welfare for the common people. He has studied issues related to worker well-being such as wages, dormitories, nutrition, medicine, working hours, and old-age allowances, and volunteered to do his part. No one seems to know the reason for Winant's such a big change, and it is not easy to explain, is it?</p>
<p>He began to show his characteristics in 1912. It is said that he was one of the three Progressive Party members in Princeton University, and the rest of the students supported Taft or Wilson. Later, in his speech when he took office as the Governor of New Hampshire, he stated his will. He told the Conservative Republicans in the state that he had learned the Republican platform from a Republican member of an internal strife, who told him that the Republican Party originally advocated human rights over property rights.</p>
<p>When he implemented his New Deal in New Hampshire and supported President Roosevelt's new policies in Washington, the Conservative Republicans were not satisfied with him. They could not understand why progressive Republicans across the country mentioned him as a possible candidate for president, and they still do not understand it.</p>
<p>Winant's personality reminds people of President Lincoln of the past. He is tall and straight as an arrow, with hazy eyes, as if in deep thought. He is in his prime of life, speaks somewhat stutteringly, and even when reading a manuscript, he is the same way. He is not particular about his clothing. He wears a dark, loose suit for a long time and lets it wrinkle. His tie is crooked, probably because he ties it while talking. He never brushes the disheveled hair on his forehead. He expresses sympathy everywhere. A hostess in Geneva said, "Winant's entry into the room makes everyone feel refreshed." When he was the director of the International Labour Bureau in Geneva, he received the welcome of at least two important figures in the current British cabinet, one was Labour leader Bevin, and the other was the current Foreign Secretary Eden.</p>
<p>He has the talent to make people respect him, because his respect for people comes entirely from sincerity. He is a patient listener, and he encourages those who visit him in a voice that is almost inaudible, saying, "You know I am not an expert!" He admits his limited talent so frankly. He likes to talk with guests, and a ten-minute meeting can be extended to an hour, so people say that he is not an administrative talent.</p>
<p>He is accustomed to searching for appropriate words when speaking in order to express his meaning, so people say that he thinks slowly. His words are hesitant and easy to deceive the listener. At first, they feel worried for him, and finally they cheer and praise him in the corridor. No matter how clumsy his appearance is, his sincere spirit will emit light.</p>
<p>When he is thinking deeply, he often turns a blind eye and a deaf ear. One day he was talking to someone in his office, he hung a coat on his arm and walked back and forth in the room. Later, the coat fell to the ground, but his thoughts were not interrupted, and he continued to walk, not knowing that his feet were trampling on the coat.</p>
<p>The closer people are to Winant, the less they find him strange. Therefore, the neighbors in Concord all unanimously support him. His party knew about his fascination at Princeton and did not want to nominate him to the state legislature, and he may never be able to enjoy the life of a civil servant. However, his neighbors all supported him. When the competition is fierce and the scores are close, such as the victory over Colonel Knox in 1924, he can at least steadily occupy a majority of fourteen to one in his hometown. Although his state does not approve of the governor's re-election, it has elected him to continue for three times. The British Labour Party's trust in him will surely win over many comrades.</p>
<p>There are many legends about his gentleness and kindness to mankind in Concord. Once he went to an orphanage, and a seriously ill child praised his leather coat. The governor sent someone to give him a leather coat as a Christmas gift on Christmas Day. Another time, when he was about to take a train in New Haven, he found that he was penniless and had no money to buy a ticket. It turned out that he had already spent all his money at St. Paul's School to help a female servant with many family problems.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Freezing of Foreign Deposits in the United States to Be Implemented; Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Other Countries Affected; Britain and Latin America May Be Excluded</h3>

Under the freezing order, the withdrawal of deposits by countries affected by the freezing must ensure that the Ministry of Finance knows that the funds are not used for the purpose of aggressor countries.

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt definitively stated yesterday that the United States has reached a critical juncture. He ordered that all mechanical work for manufacturing national defense products must be started 24 hours a day, seven days a week non-stop. Production Management Director Knudsen was ordered to put the production and work of national defense machinery and tools on a continuous basis.

<h3>Germany Declares That It Is Not Afraid of the United States; The United States Joining the War Will Only Prolong the War</h3>
<p>New York: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels met with former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Kerdache yesterday and told him that Germany has not underestimated the important position of the United States as a world power, but is not afraid of the military impact that will be caused after it joins the war. The United States' participation in the war will prolong the war and make the economic life of the world even more chaotic, but Germany cannot be held responsible for the development of the current German-U.S. relations. Since 1933, Germany has not shown any unfriendly attitude towards the United States. The so-called German troops landing in the United States is pure nonsense, but the straits ports now controlled by Germany cannot be stepped on by American troops. It is reported that Kerdache is currently stationed in Germany as a representative of the New York "Times". (Haitong Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>U.S. Circles Concerned About Gasoline Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt said yesterday that he had not heard of any new restrictions on shipping gasoline and its oils to Japan. He asked those who inquired about this matter to inquire directly with the State Department. Someone asked at the time whether the United States still has a large amount of gasoline and oils being shipped to Japan. The President replied that this question is very broad because there are many types of gasoline and oils. However, he also said that he believed that the State Department should have detailed statistics. Many observers believe that this remark is sufficient to indicate that the government is closely monitoring the special types of cargo being shipped, and the United States is very willing to keep these items for its own use or to aid friendly countries. The President also said that he had not heard of sending a minister to New Zealand, and the detailed mission of his eldest son James' trip to Cairo was also unknown. He asked people to inquire directly with the American naval officers. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Reveal the Meaning of Matsuoka's Visit to the United States in Rumor</h3>
<p>Washington: The Washington Post commented yesterday, "If the rumored Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to the United States is aimed at persuading the United States to accept Japan's New Order in East Asia, then he may as well stay in his own country." The commentary added that Matsuoka's visit to the United States may have four reasons: One is that Japan's moderates hope to delay the conflict with the United States; the second is that Japan believes that this can weaken China's morale; the third is that Japan intends to encourage the American appeasement faction; and the fourth is to try to blind the eyes of the Americans to cover up Japan's southward advance.

<h3>Remembering the Football Lineup of Old Nanyang in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the Republic, Ou Xun</h3>
<p>— Ou Xun</p>
<p>Recalling, fourteen years ago, I studied at the Fudan Public School in Li Gong Shrine, Xujiahui, this city, less than half a mile west of the school, which was the former Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Communications (formerly Nanyang Public School, now Jiaotong University). At that time, the principal was Mr. Tang Weizhi from Taicang. Mr. Tang advocated the simultaneous advancement of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Therefore, the Nanyang football team had many talented individuals and was at its peak for a time. It competed with the St. John's football team from Fanhuangdu every year for supremacy in Xupu. Whenever the oranges and tangerines turned yellow and green, the banks of the Xujiahui River were bustling with activity, and tens of thousands of fans rubbed shoulders. I was also a football fan, and every Saturday afternoon, I would go to watch from the sidelines. The dragon fought the tiger, and the blood battle was fierce, which was no less than today's Yiyuan. I only remember the positions of Feng Jianwei and Yuan Qingxiang (nicknamed Flying General), because the distance was far, and the impression was shallower. Nanyang was a neighboring school, and there were countless fellow villagers and friends in the school, so the impression was particularly deep. Although more than 20 years have passed, and people have changed, I still remember the eleven most famous players of the Nanyang football team at that time. Now, I specially present it to provide a smile for the football fans on the sea. Although it is an old event of the Kaiyuan era, it is also an important page in football history. The lineup is as follows:</p>

<h3>Grain: Another 40,000 Odd Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Rice Price Only Slightly Lower by 3-4 Yuan</h3>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice was transported to Shanghai. The French company opened its ship before (2nd) and arrived in port, transporting a large batch of foreign rice from Saigon, docking at Huashun Wharf for unloading. It was noted in yesterday's newspaper that the exact number of foreign rice loaded by the ship on that day was unknown because the ship arrived in Tanzania late. After special investigation yesterday, it was learned that the ship loaded a total of 27,010 bags of foreign rice, all of which were broken rice. Yesterday morning, Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, carrying 7,894 bags of foreign rice. The Guangdong ship transported 11,785 bags of foreign rice directly from Siam. Both ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession (Zu).</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market newly established a method in the rice market that can definitely eliminate the practice of kicking the ball and crack down on speculative robbery. The actual transaction between the cargo party and the rice store through the rice distribution company was small, so the total transaction for the day was only about 4,000 bags. New hoarders outside the industry did not get involved, and borrowers did not inquire. The market price immediately followed the normal trend and saw a downstream trend. The road for selling short and buying short remained closed. No. 1 Saigon once shouted 157 yuan, which was settled, and then gradually decreased from 156 yuan to 154 yuan. Xiaowen decreased from 148 yuan to 144 yuan. All other prices followed suit, a uniform drop of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous market. In the future, if Hong Kong rice at parity can continue to come to Shen, and Vietnamese rice continues to come to Shanghai, then the rice market can also be expected to enter a normal track. If there are any previous mistakes, then there are many worries. It is hoped that all parties concerned will seriously implement the measures to create real benefits for the citizens. No. 2 Saigon returned from 150 yuan to 146-7 yuan, the Min Party only 148-9 yuan, Xiaojiao fell from the initial 147 yuan to 144 yuan, and broken tip only opened at 120 yuan and then decreased to 112-3 yuan. The remaining goods could not be traded.</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice was still sporadic, but the way out was still more suitable compared to foreign rice. Shops still had the capacity to accept it, and the owners had no intention of easily unloading the goods. Therefore, the market was able to maintain itself and did not change, presenting a stable situation. The listed price for Changbang Qing special japonica was 162-3 yuan, Wuxi japonica was 161 yuan, Su Kun japonica was 160 yuan to 158 yuan, Qingjiao thin indica was 155-6 yuan, and the original package was 161 yuan and 160 yuan. As for rice and glutinous rice, they were not traded due to the constraints of foreign rice.</p>
<h3>American Flour Pours In, Flour Market Rapidly Declines</h3>
<p>Flour: The current situation of the foreign flour market, after the rebound from the decline in the market the day before, the situation has shown signs of collapse. The reason is that the rising winds in recent days have been too strong, and a large number of new American flour has arrived, totaling more than 300,000 bags, which has suddenly softened people's hearts. Speculative hoarders ultimately failed to fully maintain their position, and profit-taking bulls came out one after another. Therefore, the Golden Dragon brand immediately dropped to 33 yuan and 1 jiao at the opening. However, it was rumored in the middle that all the unarrived American Can-Australian flour would be delayed and would take time to ship to Shen. This was nothing more than the effect of speculative air, which slightly slowed down the market's decline. It is heard that the market price for Can flour is 33 yuan and 3-4 jiao, and the Flower and Bird brand Australian flour has also returned from 33 yuan and 7-8 jiao to the 34 yuan mark. Other miscellaneous brands have followed suit. Hua Factory's fair-priced flour is 29 yuan, supplied by Fuxin Factory with more than 5,000 bags. The insufficient amount is still supplemented by extracting foreign flour.</p>
<p>Wheat: The domestic wheat market, after being agitated by the rising winds in the flour market, the asking price has reached 51-2 yuan. However, due to the lack of spot goods, it has not been officially traded. Yesterday, the flour market declined rapidly after rising, and Fuxin Factory has received a ship of Can wheat, totaling 105,000 bags, which can produce 300,000 bags of flour for fair sale in the city. Therefore, Hua Factory no longer considers domestic wheat for raw material needs, and will wait for the new wheat to be launched before deciding whether to advance or retreat according to the environmental situation.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Oilcake Slightly Stabilizes After Two Weeks of Consecutive Gains</h3>
<p>Oilbean Cake: It is no longer as crazy as it was in the past two days, and people's enthusiasm has also calmed down. The reason is nothing more than that the prices of all goods have soared for two weeks, and hoarders have made huge profits, so the intention to release the goods has been fully revealed. Today is Father's Day, so there is a potential trend of waiting for future changes. It is estimated that Dalian soybean oil fell by 1 yuan per standard, with the price opening at 185 yuan and 50 barrels traded. Soybean cake fell by 5-6 jiao, with 15-16,000 pieces of Shengji futures cake traded at a price of 22 yuan to 22 yuan and 1 jiao for the upper half of May, 23 yuan and 5 jiao to 26 yuan for the lower half of May, and 24 yuan to 23 yuan and 5 jiao for the upper half of June. The current price of Dada four-brand cake is 21 yuan, with 1,000 pieces traded. Yuanlong traded 3 cars for the lower half of May at a price of 21 yuan and 7 jiao. Changji traded 2,000 pieces for the lower half of May at a price of 20 yuan and 5 jiao, and 1,000 pieces for the lower half of May at a price of 21 yuan. Yuanji traded 3,000 pieces for the lower half of May at a price of 21 yuan and 6-7 jiao. There are also Hankou cakes that were previously thrown out for delivery at the end of April. Now, due to the lack of goods for delivery, it is heard that the price will be settled at 18 yuan, and both parties have completed the formalities. The current price of corn has fallen by more than 1 yuan, and the futures price has fallen by about half a yuan. The rising wind of soybeans was a flash in the pan, and it remained stable yesterday. 300 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at a price of 50 yuan, and more than 2,000 bags of Guizhou beans were traded at a price of 48 yuan. The listed price of Tianjin beans was 50 yuan. In addition, 50 bags of green beans were traded at a price of 48 yuan. Furthermore, there are 1,220 bags of soybeans today (4th) to be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Exchange Market Turns, Chinese and Western Merchants Sell in Succession</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market situation, HSBC's listed prices for each exchange rate did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates turned loose and cheap. The US exchange rate of 5.125 yuan has been difficult to break, and the European war is unfavorable to the UK. The United States will further freeze the world's funds. Hua Bank and speculators have started selling in succession. HSBC has even turned to absorb and release, with the British exchange rate seeing 3 pence 21875 and the US dollar 5.1875 a loose price. Finally, it slightly recovered due to the better intention of other foreign banks. The closing price was 3 pence 203125 for the British gold and 5.15625 for the US dollar, a British loss of 015625 and a British gain of 03125. There were few transactions in the first half of the day, and there was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>There Was Also an Inflow at Noon</p>
<p>Since the morning, the British and American silver markets were flat, and Indian silver continued to rise. The exchange rates of all countries remained unchanged. The opening price of the domestic market was the bank's selling price, with the spot British exchange rate at 3 pence 1875 and the US dollar at 5.125. After opening, the British exchange rate immediately hardened to 3 pence 20125, which could be settled. Hua Bank sold the May period to HSBC for 3 pence 21875, and the US exchange rate could also be settled at 5.15625 amidst the selling wind of speculators. It was even sold to HSBC for the May US dollar at 5.1875. HSBC's listed prices for each exchange rate did not change. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 24.50%, the US dollar at 5.1875 for this month was once difficult to sell and could be settled, and the British gold at 3 pence 21875 could also be purchased. However, soon, foreign banks saw that the intention to accept cheap goods was slightly better, and the speculative intention to sell turned weaker, so it was seen to soften. HSBC issued a US dollar at 5.12625 for this month from a certain bank, and the market trend later stabilized. At noon closing, the spot and June period were both 3 pence 203125 for the British exchange rate and 5.15625 for the US dollar, a British loss of 015625 and a British gain of 03125 compared to the closing price of the previous day.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Downstream as All Parties Dump, Retreats to the 6,700 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was dark and the black market turned downstream, with the price retreating to the edge of the 6,700 yuan mark. People's hearts in all directions turned tired. The European war developed and the US exchange rate also loosened with the British gold, and news of the United States implementing a freeze on the world's funds was rumored. Therefore, under the successive selling momentum of securities firms, gold firms, silver firms, and exchange bill merchants, the price stepped back from 6,740 yuan to 6,701 yuan. It was pulled up by scattered shorts entering, ultimately squeezing down a small 28 yuan. The total transaction for the first half of the day was 16,700 taels. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. Jewelry gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat, and cash also saw a decline. Yongfengyu issued 100 taels at a price 130 yuan higher than the futures transaction price. Xianghe issued 100 taels, 110 yuan higher. Both were bought by Dofu. At the last moment, Shihe issued Xiangxingyong 50 taels, 120 yuan higher, which also squeezed down about 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Dark Red Returns Down 28 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) was quite stable at first. The market opened at 6,735 yuan at 9:15 AM, 3 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Next was 6,740 yuan. Dafeng, Chi Da, Hengji, Dofu, and retail investors sold vigorously. It was heard that the May US dollar at 5.15625 could be settled, and the price suddenly fell to 6,715 yuan. It was absorbed by Xinfengyong, Chengji, and Xianghe, and raised to 6,725 yuan. The May US dollar hardened to 5.1875, making it difficult to sell. Dafengyufengyong and Dofu came to release again, and it fell by more than 20 yuan, falling to 6,701 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange stopped loosening and slightly recovered. Xinfengyongxiang and He Lijin raised the price to 6,718 yuan. At noon closing, it was pressed down to 6,710 yuan, 28 yuan lower than the previous day. The settlement price for the May US dollar at 5.15625 was 6,754 yuan, which was 44 yuan less. After closing, it retreated to 6,707 yuan, and finally 6,710 yuan. There was a difference of 39 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no trading outside the market in the afternoon. The selling price of cash firm's own brand gold was 130 yuan higher than the dark red futures trading price, and the buying price was 70-80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for the current standard gold price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Price Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold in silver shops is still listed at 705 yuan per tael, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buying back.</p>
<h3>American Notes at 19 Yuan, Enter and Then Exit</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the dark red market price trended weak. British and American gold pounds also fell by 1 yuan each. British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price stood flat. American gold notes once broke through the 19 yuan mark, ultimately closing at 19 yuan and 1 fen, a squeeze down of 5 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes had even supply and demand, and the market price stood flat. Japanese gold notes still stood at the original price of 2 yuan and 9 fen. Korean notes had a slight supply, and the market price loosened. The evening market retreated to 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 3 fen.</p>
<p>Securities: Public Debt Does Not Escape Sideways Trading</p>
<p>The black market for public debt, yesterday's market situation still did not escape the sideways trading situation. There were many bulls emerging on the table, and the situation was still tired and unable to rise. There was no improvement in the market transaction, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. The idle and dull state may not be easy to develop for a while. Therefore, the public debt market is temporarily more deserted. Yesterday was Saturday, and only half a day of trading was done. Tong Kang Lianhe bought Type C, and Shunchang Renchang bought Type E. Therefore, Types C and E were once raised by 2-4 jiao. However, Lianhe came to sell Type E again, and the supply of the remaining companies, such as Jiucheng Lianyi Runli Dunyu Xinfu, was endless. Although Renfeng Delong still had capacity, the supply was already felt to be greater than the demand, so it returned a small 2-3 jiao. Type D opened, but Type A failed to be traded. The results of the market situation were mixed, with mostly declines and fewer gains. The transaction volume was estimated to be about 8-900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Shares: Transactions, 100 shares of Dachina Dachai Company were traded at a price of 34 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Profit-Taking Emerges, Yarn Market Returns Looser, Actual Sales Have Reported Declining, Money Market Also Slightly Tightens</h3>
<p>The yarn market started high and turned flat, but the trend is slightly stable. This is because the continuous rise has already caused a large degree of increase, causing profit-takers to emerge, with the table slightly looser. At the same time, actual sales are not as smooth as the previous day due to the weekend, which makes people's hearts carry flatness. Currently, the general discussion in the market is that if the 1,600 yuan mark fails to break through, there may be a 30-40 yuan pullback, and the price of 1,550 yuan may be seen before dragging in again. However, the amount of multiple and short transactions remains prosperous and frequent. The former changes are still in multiple events. The high price for 20-count yarn was 1,585 yuan and the low price was 1,563 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend relationship, people's hearts were scattered, and the transaction price for a small number of transactions was 1,563-4 yuan. According to the reasons for being optimistic about the market some days ago, it is said that the Shuangma Factory has 26-27,000 packs on a single basis, which has been gradually reduced recently, leaving only 17-18,000 packs. Therefore, there are more who buy and fewer who sell. How the future will be is difficult to predict. Today, there were 1,320 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning. Because the market situation was quite beautiful on the afternoon of the previous day, the popularity was enthusiastic, there were more buyers and fewer sellers, and the table atmosphere was very tight. The shouts were loud. The first round price was 1,580 yuan. Due to the tense situation, it rose to 1,585 yuan shortly after. At this time, when the price was high, it caused a large number of multiple orders from the securities gang to emerge. Once the chips loosened, the market fell back to 1,566-7 yuan. This price circulated for a long time. It is said that the money market has tightened and there is a tendency to hold back. There were some ups and downs in the middle, and it rose back to 1,571 yuan. Ultimately, the closing price was 1,565 yuan because the current yarn transaction was not as prosperous as the previous day and people's enthusiasm turned light. After investigation, the transaction statistics for the half day were 8,010 packs. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 650 Inland 360</p>
<p>Colleagues 7,000 Statistics 8,010</p>
<p>With Yarn Flat and Tired, Cotton Sales Turn Light</p>
<p>The situation of current cotton. It was colorful by tracking the yarn market the day before. All Chinese and foreign factories had considerable needs, and people's hearts were excited for a while. However, the amount of cotton transported from overseas was very large. Therefore, the market trended light again yesterday. This is because the yarn market was flat and tired in the morning, and the factory was not interested in purchasing goods, and it was also Saturday. The household transactions made by each company yesterday are listed on the left.</p>
<p>US Medelin 417 Synergistic Xing 200 Pieces, Warehousing</p>
<p>US Pennsylvania 324 C Chang 300 Pieces, Warehousing</p>
<p>Indian Rangoon Flower 3 Shunxingchang 100 Pieces, Warehousing</p>
<p>Another message from Shanghai's foreign cotton trading. There were not many transactions, but colleagues still saw the market high due to the good current yarn situation. Yesterday, Yongan also imported 650 bales of Indian cotton Huisi Deng, and Shenxin imported 200 bales of Pennsylvania. The market price was about 330 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose due to the entry of peers and Wall Street, and then fell back due to the closing of profits by all parties. As a result, the closing price was about 2 pounds higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the US cotton statistics from August 1 of last year to May 2 of this year are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bale).</p>
<p>Cumulative Listing 10,497,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Factory Use 7,847,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports 889,000 bales</p>
<p>To Japan 95,000 bales</p>
<p>To China 51,100 bales</p>
<p>To the United Kingdom 36,000 bales</p>
<p>To Germany 149,000 bales</p>
<p>Stocks in Various Ports 6,155,000 bales</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was quite weak, and it felt weak due to the selling of European exporters and the closing of profits. The closing prices fluctuated by 1-2 rupees.</p>
<p>Also, the predicted opening market situation today is seen as high by 0.25 rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Passenger Sales Are Still Active</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, and colleagues' entry and exit turned lighter. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants continued to take in passengers, and retail purchases from this street and various inland routes were still frequent. The selling of fine cloth and fine twill was mixed, with hand goods slightly cheaper by 1-2 jiao. Coarse cloth and group twill were firm, and a part of the scarce goods rose by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. The general market for bleached and dyed cloth was flat. This street transacted more than 300 pieces of various cloths, and the Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 200 pieces of twill colored cloth and colored twill, etc. Singapore, Siam, and other places purchased 4-5,000 pieces of printed cloth, bleached cloth, and twill, etc.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Yesterday's market had extremely minor rises and falls. The leading white cloth and fine cloth now revolves around 51.7-8 yuan in the warehouse list, and the closing price at noon was 51.7 yuan, a drop of 5 fen. Colorful ball fine cloth rose by 2 jiao, flying fish fell by 2 jiao, and fine twill was as stable as ever. Serge fell first and then rose, and there was not much honor or disgrace. The Huang warehouse list was sold at 1 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen, and 2 and a half li.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (4th), there are 1,440 pieces of cotton cloth to be shipped to Hong Kong, and another 995 pieces to be shipped to Yangon.</p>
<h3>White Serge Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>White serge is extremely scarce in this summer market, especially East goods. High-end West goods of more than 40 yuan still have supply, but ordinary and lower-end goods are non-existent among colleagues. Therefore, buyers have no choice but to equip themselves with high-end goods. According to East goods, high-end goods are scarce and there are more lower-end goods. Lower-end goods have quite a lot of jumps and are not clean, and they are also light and thin, so customers do not look at them at all. Yesterday, the British-made No. 1 white serge was generally sold at 46-7 yuan per yard, the deputy number was 42-3 yuan, the East goods No. 1 was 33-4 yuan, the ordinary was 28-9 yuan, and the lower-end secondary number was 23-4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rise Sharply, Then Fall Slightly—Profit-Taking After Exceeding Limit Prices—</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a sharp rise for several consecutive days. Spot and coarse white sugar prices all exceeded limit prices. Many long positions took profits, and there was some selling pressure, leading to a slight pullback. The guild's quoted price for spot #24 coarse white sugar was 24 yuan. Foreign godown prices were 113 yuan 7 jiao in the morning and 113 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen in the afternoon. The May 10 futures contract had risen by about 12 yuan on the 1st and 2nd. Yesterday morning, it was 116 yuan to 112 yuan 4 jiao, and in the afternoon, 113 yuan 5 jiao to 2 jiao, closing at 114 yuan 9 jiao, down 2 yuan 6 jiao. The May 20 futures contract was 117 yuan to 113 yuan 8 jiao in the morning and 114 yuan to 115 yuan 9 jiao in the afternoon, down 3 yuan 6 jiao. Dutch red sugar remained tight, initially at 87 yuan 5 jiao, rising to 88 yuan to 89 yuan, and 88 yuan in the afternoon, up 10 yuan from the low of 84 yuan. On the previous day, Taikoo Granulated B mark was priced at 120 yuan for Western godown stock, while yesterday, Eastern godown stock was 116 yuan, down about 3 yuan. DY mark was quoted at 107 yuan, and HX mark at 106 yuan for Western godown stock. There were 200 bags of sugar arriving from Hong Kong three days ago.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Prices Rise in the Gray Market</h3>
<p>Hongji white coal has been arriving recently and is not unpopular. Several ships arrive each month, but mostly with coal dust, causing lump coal prices to be exceptionally high. Brokers and industry insiders report that while the official price remains at 370 yuan, this is limited to two baskets. To purchase larger quantities, one must search the market for old orders from hoarders, and the gray market price is 60 yuan higher than the official price, causing great confusion among the shops on this street. Screened lump coal delivered to customers costs 460 yuan per ton, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods Though Hainan Dried Longan Rises, Dealers Are Willing to Sell All Stocks</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan has been scarce recently. Although prices have gradually increased by 30-40 yuan, dealers have not been willing to sell all their stocks. Yesterday, prices were raised by another 5 yuan, and traders are observing the market and have not entered. If they persist, a deal will surely be made.</p>
<h3>Metals Pig Lead and Huisi Iron Remain Firm and High</h3>
<p>The market for pig lead and Huisi iron has appeared quite firm recently. Due to continued demand from canneries and printing factories on this street, the market is lively, boosting the confidence of traders. Prices have remained very firm. Yesterday, each 200-pound case opened at 370 yuan, up 5-6 yuan from before. It is said that the total transaction volume for the day was about 140-150 cases. Because the overseas supply of these goods is not continuous and local inventories are limited, holders of goods are increasingly bullish and reluctant to release large quantities in wholesale transactions.</p>
<h3>Sundries Soap Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The soap price surge is unstoppable. Speculators and hoarders are sparing no effort to purchase and hoard, causing prices to rise repeatedly. Current market prices include 59 yuan per case for Goben Soap from Xiaoshadu Road, 52 yuan per case for Baixiangmao Soap, 48 yuan per case for Huangxiangmao Soap, and 46 yuan per case for Arrow Soap. All have risen sharply compared to last week. Speculative sentiment is strong, and prices are still expected to rise.</p>

<h3>Coordinating People's Food Supply and Suppressing Market Prices Hong Kong Rice Prices Determined Rice Shops to Sell at 110 Yuan per Shi Rice Merchants Directly Ordering Restricted The Authority's Plan to Control Rice Supply in the City Gradually Takes Shape</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has completed the procurement of Hong Kong Kang price foreign rice. The first batch of 5,000 tons has already been shipped from Hong Kong and will arrive in the coming days. Yesterday, sources at the Municipal Council revealed that the selling prices of the foreign rice have been determined by the authorities as follows: (1) The Municipal Council sells to merchants at 122 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen per bag; (2) Merchants sell to rice shops at 133 yuan 5 jiao per bag; (3) Rice shops sell to citizens at 110 yuan per shi. It is understood that the profit margin for merchants is 5% to 10%. Merchants are required to pay 30% of the purchase price to the Municipal Council as a deposit when ordering, and the full amount is due upon delivery. It is said that many rice merchants have registered and applied to sell the rice. It is also understood that the first batch of low-priced foreign rice purchased by the French authorities has been shipped from Annam, but the exact date of arrival is unknown.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Rice of Superior Quality</p>
<p>Foreign rice is divided into #1 and #2 Saigon rice and small broken rice. Saigon rice is better, but small broken rice is also quite edible, only the grains are smaller. The two municipal authorities of the settlements have announced that a large batch of patterned rice shipped from Hong Kong and Vietnam will arrive in Shanghai within two weeks and will be sold at 110 yuan per shi. However, the price of #1 Saigon rice in Shanghai is still 155 yuan per shi, as speculative rice merchants are still waiting and watching. It appears that they will only be willing to comply after the rice has actually arrived in Shanghai. Citizens of the two settlements have stopped buying high-priced rice from retailers in the past two days, but laborers who buy and eat rice as they go are suffering. Therefore, those with surplus grain should refrain from buying rice for the time being, which would also curb the rampant activities of rice speculators.</p>
<p>Chartering Ships Most Important</p>
<p>An editorial in the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* stated that the Municipal Council's plan to ship rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, having secured the necessary ships for implementation, is a major blow to speculators. There is no actual shortage of rice in the city at present; the only problem is the unavailability of low-priced rice. The culprits responsible for this situation are those who hoard large quantities of rice in order to profit from speculation. If the Municipal Council can ship rice to Shanghai and control rice prices to maintain a reasonable level, the rice currently hoarded in warehouses will be released for sale at lower prices. Since the Municipal Council sells rice at 110 yuan per shi, no one will be willing to buy rice from speculators at 150 yuan per shi. Moreover, even if speculators sell their hoarded rice at 110 yuan per shi, they will still make a profit and will be happy to sell it. Therefore, the price of rice in Shanghai will surely fall to a reasonable level. Furthermore, the Municipal Council's current regulation that all rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai in quantities exceeding 2,900 tons must be purchased and sold exclusively by the Municipal Council, and that the Hong Kong government will no longer issue permits, is extremely important. This will subject rice merchants to control and prevent them from engaging in illegal activities.</p>
<p>Rice Speculators' Arrogance Begins to Subside Yesterday</p>
<p>Business transactions among rice merchants in the rice market have become impossible after the Market Management Committee took emergency measures. Illegal transactions have gradually disappeared. All rice transactions made by rice merchants and customers in the market now require both the buyer and seller to issue a transaction slip, which is then taken to the "Public Notary Office" by the rice broker who facilitated the transaction to be stamped. Under close supervision in many aspects of yesterday morning's market, speculators seemed to have exhausted their tricks. Fearing a sharp drop in rice prices after the arrival of low-priced rice in Shanghai, they gradually supplied their hoarded goods to the market. At that time, the supply of spot goods increased slightly, and rice shops became less willing to buy. As a result, the price fell by about 4 yuan compared to the previous market price.</p>
<p>Brokers' Actions Worth Noting</p>
<p>The Rice Brokers Association issued a public notice to the rice market yesterday stating that all members must wear their badges and use the Association's standard brokerage slips when conducting business. This has long been the regulation. Given the current period of rising rice prices, members will temporarily take turns entering the market for brokerage on a daily basis in shifts of half. They must also deposit their Grain Guild certificates with the Association in order to prevent afternoon trading. They are requested to submit their Grain Guild certificates between 9:30 and 10:00 AM each day and pick up the Association's badge, returning the original certificate after 11:00 AM. Late arrivals will be considered as abandonment. In addition, the 35th Notice was issued stating that members' living expenses are increasing daily, and the brokerage commission has been increased to one jiao per bag in national currency. All non-members are required to register and join the Association within one week to obtain a badge and enter the market for brokerage. It is understood that there are currently over 110 brokers in the rice market acting as intermediaries for rice shops, all of whom are members of the Rice Brokers Association and hold badges issued by the Association. However, the market is already crowded, and it is difficult to understand why the Association is still recruiting non-members.</p>
<p>600,000 Bags of Flour Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai's flour supply is being continuously shipped from the United States on American cargo ships, so there is no fear of shortage. On the 2nd of this month, the American cargo ship "Loganberry" (transliteration) arrived from the United States with 400,000 bags of flour. According to the American shipping company, another American cargo ship named "American" (transliteration) will bring 250,000 bags of flour to supply Shanghai merchants next week. Both of the above-mentioned cargo ships sailed from Seattle to Shanghai in October. Afterwards, the cargo ships will continue to travel between Europe, Asia, and the United States, carrying flour and other goods. The Shanghai Municipal Council continues to order flour merchants to sell flour at lower prices in order to ease the livelihood of the people.</p>
<h3>British War Time Fund in Shanghai Nears Two Million</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the British War Time Fund in Shanghai has reached nearly two million yuan. This is because more than 30,000 yuan were donated last week, bringing the total to 1,988,000 yuan. The largest donation last week came from "KYZI," totaling 1,021 pounds, 6 shillings, and 4 pence in British currency. The largest individual donation was from Mrs. Tao Si Paulo, totaling 4,000 yuan in legal tender. The Taikoo Company and the Oriental Paint Company jointly donated 1,101 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Tianxiang Employees Dedicate Fighter Plane</p>
<p>It is understood that the employees of the British trading company Tianxiang Yanghang and its branches throughout the Far East, sympathizing with the British war effort and hoping for an early victory, launched a fundraising campaign to purchase a fighter plane to present to the British government. Since the launch of the campaign, the Chinese and Western employees of the company have enthusiastically contributed, and have already raised enough funds to be remitted to London to purchase a Spitfire fighter plane for the Royal Air Force. It is reported that the British Air Minister Sir Beverbrook Lorne has telegraphed the Hong Kong General Manager of the company, Mr. Tao Daweier, to express his gratitude. It is said that each Spitfire fighter plane is worth at least 5,000 pounds.</p>

<h3>National Medicine Raises Prices to Improve Employee Benefits Aid Should Be Given to the Poor and Sick Who Cannot Afford Medicine French Concession Garbage Workers Cause Trouble Again</h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau employs approximately 700 garbage collectors, including 46 "A-type" temporary workers. Due to unfulfilled demands for improved benefits and increased wages, a general strike broke out on the morning of October 27. By November 1, negotiations were completed, and the wages of all workers were increased by 30%. The workers declared the strike successfully resolved and resumed work on the same day. However, the Public Works Bureau dismissed all 46 "A-type" temporary workers who had initiated the strike.</p>
<p>Garbage Workers Salary Deduction Dispute</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday, some of the workers who had resumed work suddenly went on strike again and incited others to engage in slowdowns. The reason was that they did not want the French Public Works Bureau to deduct three days' wages for the strike period and demanded that they be paid in full. The dismissed "A-type" temporary workers also demanded to be rehired and allowed to resume work. As a result, many workers gathered in front of the engineering office at the intersection of Route Doumer and Rue Massenet to await news of the negotiations. The French police, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the workers and disperse them. It is reported that five or six workers who caused trouble were arrested. Fearing that the workers would cause further disturbances, the police dispatched Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese detectives to guard the engineering office to prevent incidents.</p>
<p>National Medicine Industry Improved Treatment</p>
<p>The case of national medicine workers demanding improved treatment has lasted for more than half a month. Fortunately, both sides were able to understand each other, so a strike did not occur. The representatives of both labor and management negotiated again the afternoon before yesterday, and a satisfactory resolution was reached. The conditions agreed upon by both labor and management are as follows: (1) Salaries will be increased by 140% of the original contract level as a living allowance. (2) The original rice subsidy will be changed to a special allowance and divided into two types: Heye Hall and Xinyi Hall. Heye Hall will be divided into four levels: special, A, B, and C. The special level will receive 26 yuan per month, A 20 yuan, B 14 yuan, and C 8 yuan. Xinyi Hall will be divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. Level A will receive 16 yuan per month, B 13 yuan, C 10 yuan, and D 7 yuan. If there are grades better than the above, all will be increased by 50%. (3) Monthly regulations will be 4 yuan per month uniformly. (4) All the above conditions will be implemented in May. The capital also took the opportunity to raise prices, increasing the fees for drugs sold in stores by 20%. However, the prices of national medicines have risen greatly since last year, and the business of this industry has flourished recently. The salary increase should not be difficult to compensate for, so there is no need to increase the burden on patients, which is despised by society. Special care should be given to the poor.</p>
<p>Business Colleagues Petition Today</p>
<p>Since the assistant manager, Li Bojia, came to Shanghai and announced that all the requested conditions had to be decided by the board of directors, representatives from the factory and the publishing house will each send three representatives today to petition the directors, asking them to quickly resolve the urgent situation to avoid serious problems. Moreover, at this time and in this situation, both parties should work together to overcome difficulties. It is said that the board of directors will hold a strike in a day or two, hoping that the future will be resolved through reasonable means.</p>
<p>Machine Model Labor-Management Agreement</p>
<p>Workers in the machine model industry have requested an increase in wages. Labor and management have reached an agreement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Wages are divided into two types, A and B. Type A workers, those earning 1 yuan or more per day, will receive a general increase of 50% of their original wage. Type B workers, those earning 1.5 jiao or less per day, will receive a general increase of 60% of their original wage. If the price of rice rises to 180 yuan, wages will be renegotiated. (2) The rice subsidy will be 3 jiao per person per day. If the price of rice exceeds 130 yuan, an additional 2 jiao will be added for every 20 yuan increase. (3) The wages of short-term workers will be increased by 30% of the original price. Workers shall not be dismissed without cause.</p>
<h3>Shen Qiquan Declines Birthday Celebrations and Writes to His Nephews to Express His Aspirations</h3>
<p>Shen Hongquan, a historian from Yuanhu and a respected figure in the Hanlin Academy, will be 80 years old on the 9th day of the fifth month this year. His nephews and nieces requested to offer him congratulations, but he firmly refused. Recently, it was reported that he wrote a letter to his nephews and nieces, refusing their birthday greetings. The sentiments expressed were sincere, and the literary style was excellent and worthy of being read. It has been copied here. The letter reads: "I am now eighty years old. Gentlemen in my hometown want to celebrate my birthday, but I have firmly declined. My children and grandchildren are planning ways to entertain me on this day, but they have not understood my intentions, so I am writing this letter to explain. Our country is suffering from war, and it may not end in five years. The war in Europe is expanding, and countless people are donating their lives and brains. How can I celebrate my birthday in peace? My ancestors were honest officials. For decades, I have viewed officialdom as like studying in Shaanxi. I have never taken any illegitimate money. My nephews and nieces have seen this firsthand. Now I am old and sell my writing for a living. My hernia causes me severe pain, but if I can hold a pen, I will force myself to write. Recently, everything has become expensive, rice is more precious than pearls, and firewood is more precious than cinnamon. Prices are still rising every day, and I am worried that I will not be able to afford congee. The banquet that my nephews and nieces are planning will cost several thousand taels of gold in one day. How can I afford it? My nephews and nieces know this very well. My close friends have always taken care of me, and I am grateful. But even if my nephews and nieces are planning for me, it is easy to gather thousands of fox furs, so why not allow me to save my limited energy for the remaining years of my life, instead of spending it all in one day for pleasure? Even if those who benefit me do not say it, can I not feel ashamed in my heart? I heard that Zheng is asking Sun Zhang to write a birthday speech for me, but I firmly refused. It seems that I am being unfeeling. When Tang Jingxian was governing Suzhou and his birthday arrived, the scholars and officials of Suzhou offered him birthday screens, but he firmly refused. Wang Hanlin ordered the scribe Wen Zai to record this matter. How can I dare to compare myself to Jingxian, and view Yao Feng as the author? It is still being unfeeling. It is not too late to cancel the banquet. Zhou Zhigui sold his house in his later years to help the army and moved to a humble alley. When he was eighty years old, his son joined the army. His nephew asked to perform a play to celebrate his birthday. Zhigui said that he did not take the goods and property of the poor, nor the strength of the old. He also told his nephew that scholars are nothing but paper tigers, and they cannot be lavish. I will use these words to thank my nephews and nieces and the gentlemen in my hometown. They have always understood me. Chao Laoren."</p>
<h3>Four American Liners To Arrive in Shanghai This Month</h3>

On the 20th, the President Taft will return to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong, and will depart for America the 21st.</p>
<h3>Coal Companies Control Spot Goods Excessively Issue Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>The supply of spot goods in the coal market has obviously increased in the past two weeks. However, there are few inquiries for these spot goods, and although the supply of warehouse receipts is large, the demand still exceeds the supply due to the wide range of channels. This is because most of those active in the coal market at present are speculators, who are solely focused on raising prices for profit. They are not interested in buying and selling spot goods, because once spot goods are purchased, they must be released quickly. Otherwise, they would have to rent additional warehouse space and pay storage fees or transportation costs, increasing the cost. However, there are no such expenses for purchasing warehouse receipts, and the cost is naturally lower. If the authorities were to investigate the inventory of coal, they could avoid suspicion of hoarding. Moreover, buying and selling warehouse receipts is easier and more convenient than spot goods. Therefore, warehouse receipts are considered a scarce commodity in the market, and speculators are competing to buy them, and there is a risk of prices being raised. As a result, gray market activity is rampant, and speculators are waiting for slight changes in the domestic and international situation to sharply raise prices. According to another source, several large coal companies are also taking advantage of the opportunity to issue more warehouse receipts, claiming to "regulate the coal market," while hiding spot goods for their own use and refusing to sell. Therefore, the only important thing today is for the authorities to order the major coal companies to restrict the issuance of warehouse receipts. The supply of legitimate coal merchants should also be adjusted to prevent hoarding, and other industries that are legitimately using coal should be supplied without restriction. This would perhaps eliminate gray market activity in the coal market.</p>
<h3>British Territorial Waters Surcharges on Water Insurance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Marine Insurance Association and the Insurance Industry Association have reportedly agreed that, as of April 10 of this year, the insurance rates for the coasts of the English, Irish, Red Sea, Black Sea, and Gulf of Aden will be subject to the following surcharges on the current water insurance rates for all voyages originating, terminating, or stopping in the following areas, with the insured amount calculated per hundred yuan: (A) All of mainland Europe and Iceland within the area from the northern White Russia to the Strait of Gibraltar: 5 jiao per hundred. (B) Black Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and their connecting waterways, as well as all ports in the Gulf of Aden: 3 jiao 7 fen 5 li per hundred. (C) Within the British Dominions and territories, and the territories of its Allied countries, outside of areas (A) and (B), but excluding voyages originating, terminating, or both originating and terminating in the Western Hemisphere (i.e., North America, Central America, South America, and the islands within their territorial waters): 1 jiao 2 fen 5 li per hundred. The surcharges for the above items (A), (B), and (C) must be calculated incrementally. For example, a voyage from Shanghai to the Suez Canal via Hong Kong will be subject to both (B) and (C) surcharges, i.e., 3 jiao 7 fen 5 li per hundred plus an additional 1 jiao 2 fen 5 li per hundred.</p>
<h3>Consistency in the Practice of the Five Teachings</h3>
<p>At the 14th lecture of the Melting Pot Sutra Society, Mr. Sun Xiangzhong lectured on the consistency in the practice of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. After members of the society introduced Mr. Sun's background, he began his lecture by saying: The world has countless religions. To name the major ones, there are Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. Those who enter into these religions with a heart for integration often say that the spirit of each religion is the same, so why are their actual manifestations so different? Upon careful examination, one finds that the rise of each religion has its own time and place. Ancient sages established teachings to save the world and guide people, so they necessarily focused on the customs and practices of the people of their time. Because the customs and practices of different eras differ, the rules of each religion also differ from one another. However, the differences among religions are also their strengths, and that is where they offer remedies for the contemporary world.</p>
<p>Since the rules of each religion are not the same, it seems difficult to communicate based on their apparent differences. But today, when we talk about the possibility of integrating religions, we are tracing back to the fundamental nature of their source. However, when it comes to this fundamental nature, how exactly is it round or square, long or short? There are things that cannot be measured, and so ultimately we return to the unspeakable, the unspeakable. If it is said to be unspeakable, then it can no longer have names or forms. In the end, even the teachings cease to exist, and there is no need to talk about integration anymore. This is pursuing the essence of religion, detaching from reality, and naturally walking the path of transcendence.</p>
<p>To understand religion, both ends must be given equal importance, and especially the way the ancient sages dwelt in the central path and put it to use must be sought. The foundation of religion is rooted in the source of inherent nature: Confucianism's Great Heaven, Buddhism's Tathagata, Taoism's Naturalness, Christianity's Universal Love, and Islam's True Master. This is the upper end. The purpose of religion is to love humanity universally. Confucianism seeks to illuminate virtue throughout the world, Buddhism takes great compassion as its foundation, Taoism values taking the world as one's own self, Christianity teaches that I came to serve others, and Islam considers this world as the field for the next. This is the lower end. What is valued in dwelling in the central path and putting it to use is precisely the practice that connects the upper and lower ends, the perfect integration of nature and form, responding to events without forgetting one's nature, preserving one's nature without forgetting the events, body, mind, Dao, and art, all working together. This is the consistency of practice.</p>
<p>The Great Dao is everywhere, and principle and phenomena are inherently not two. It is only people's opinions that obstruct the space between them, so they often go to extremes, clinging to principle and becoming rigidly empty, adhering to events and becoming bogged down. Events and principles do not complement each other, and so they deviate from the Dao, straying further and further away, creating immense suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to save this world of great suffering, there is one prerequisite: What is this condition? It is that we must value human morality. If people seek to accord with the Dao, they must strive to fully realize their human nature and exert themselves in the world. Therefore, we utilize the already established plans of the great religions to achieve their goals. Goals have different sizes and priorities, so the implementation of plans also vary in size and priority. By studying religion, one can understand its essence, not cling to its forms, and not conflict with one another due to differences in rules. Moreover, one should adopt new plans in a timely manner, melting ancient and modern learning, Dao, and art into one furnace. What is central and what is secondary should be used together. From religion, various sciences can be nurtured, so that a complete and good civilization can be cultivated. The goals that each religion sets, such as Great Harmony, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Kingdom of Heaven, and so on, can then be realized everywhere.</p>
<p>As for the stages of implementing the plans of each religion, there are naturally near-term and long-term perspectives. Speaking of what humanity urgently needs, the high and far-reaching lies in extending the origin to attain the union of nature and heaven, a deep and traceless state, equating a thousand ages to a single breath. The broad and near-term lies in encompassing the present world to seek the union of self and others, promoting universality, and uniting all nations into one. But the key to implementation lies in first achieving the union of body and mind. When the heart has a central master, it is sufficient to open and close all phenomena, never ceasing. How can body and mind be united? One must firmly adhere to precepts, temper habits, and return to purity. How can self and others be united? One must broadly extend love, and only by truly having no self can one truly have others. How can nature and heaven be united? One must forget oneself and also forget things, and naturally attain a state of divine movement. These methods are vastly different, and the efforts required are extremely different, but every drop returns to the source, all being in accordance with the way of humanity. Only in this way can one truly connect the spirit of each religion, and only in this way can one truly realize the consistency of practice in each religion. These humble opinions are not meant to be definitive. I respectfully ask the eminent figures of the present age to offer their guidance!</p>
<p>The thirteenth lecture, given by my late father, on the fundamental consistency of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, has already been announced in print.</p>
<h3>Mourners at the Lonely Battalion Camp Continued to Arrive Yesterday in an Endless Stream, but Strict Precautions Prevented Entry; the Date of the Memorial Service Has Not Yet Been Decided</h3>
<p>Since the memorial service for Lonely Battalion Commander Zhang Xie was postponed, due to the abrupt nature of the decision, many in various circles were unable to learn of it. Therefore, from morning to night yesterday, many people continued to arrive to participate. The police department, in order to maintain order on the occasion of the Fifth Anniversary Memorial, took special emergency measures. Except for those who sent wreaths and elegiac couplets, no one else was allowed to enter the camp. Many Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at the camp gate, and a red police car was on alert nearby in the morning. In addition, temporary barbed wire was set up at the intersections of Singapore Road and Haifang Road, and Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road, to search pedestrians and vehicles if necessary. As a result, the atmosphere around the Lonely Battalion camp was quite tense. According to reliable sources, the Public Works Department police authorities did not have any contact with Deputy Regiment Commander Lei yesterday. They plan to send someone to the Lonely Battalion camp this morning to discuss and decide on the date of the memorial service with Deputy Regiment Commander Lei.</p>
<h3>American Missionary in Yichang Lives in Constant Worry, Movement and Food are Restricted, US Dollars Cannot be Remitted</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that news from Yichang describes the plight of an American missionary and his family living outside the city. It is said that the missionary's family is restricted by the Japanese army, allowed to leave their residence only three times a week. Moreover, their purchase of food is also restricted by the Japanese authorities, leaving them with insufficient food for the missionary couple and their two children. For example, eggs can be bought for four per dollar, but the quantity is limited and insufficient. What is worse, the missionary is now penniless, which is also due to the restrictions imposed by the Japanese army. The missionary's salary, paid in US dollars, is all stored in Shanghai. For several months, they have wanted to remit it to Yichang, but they have not obtained permission from the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Price Increase for Public Buses of British Merchants Must be Approved</h3>
<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company has recently petitioned the Public Works Department to increase fares, citing huge expenses. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the fare increase for public buses must be reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities Committee, so its implementation is still pending. Residents generally believe that the fares of public buses on various routes have been repeatedly increased since 19XX, so they hope that the company can reorganize its business, prevent fare increases, and reduce the burden on passengers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Claims That the Goods from Nanguo Ship Case Was Smoothly Resolved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that when answering questions about the Nanguo freighter Tommy Kirafu at a press conference yesterday afternoon (the 2nd), a Japanese naval spokesman said that the Japanese side believes that the matter has been smoothly resolved. The spokesman reiterated the Japanese desire to prevent European wars from spreading to the Far East, saying that the peaceful resolution of the matter made the Japanese authorities "pleased." The Italian authorities' purchase of Tommy Kirafu was the basis for the resolution.</p>

<h3>Daughter of a Prominent Family Conspired with Kidnappers to Kidnap Her Brother and Sister-in-Law, but Failed; Failed to Entice Cheng Zeheng's Chauffeur; Accomplices Also Committed Other Kidnappings</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple Patrol arrested Wang Wenying, a 22-year-old woman from Ningbo, and Zhang Hongxiang, Zai Jinbiao, Mark Bai, and others, and sent them to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu took the seat to continue the interrogation. The defendants were represented by lawyers Wang Yaotang, Fan Gang, Qian Zheng, Yu Enliang, Song Yuntao, and others. According to Patrol Lawyer Li Zhishan, the defendants Wang Wenying, Zhang Hongxiang, and Mark Bai are being prosecuted for conspiring to kidnap Cheng Zeheng</p>
<p>with intent to extort a ransom.</p>
<p>Cheng Zeheng graduated from the Soochow Law School and is a lawyer living at 533 West Ames Road in the French Concession. His family is wealthy. He has a private car with license plate number 320. However, he did not follow family instructions and had an affair with the rogue Zhang Jipin, opening room 425 at the Continental Hotel. Zhang and Ma also often went there to chat. Because they were financially strapped, Wang suggested that since her brother-in-law Cheng Zeheng</p>
<p>is quite wealthy,</p>
<p>it would be better to kidnap him and demand a ransom of at least hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan. They discussed it and agreed to use a car to kidnap him on a certain day, but it failed due to time constraints. Later, they bought a car and tried to kidnap him again. On one hand, Wang contacted Cheng's chauffeur, Yu Chang, and asked him to cooperate. However, Yu Chang's conscience had not been extinguished. Not only did he refuse to cooperate, but he also told Wang not to commit such an illegal act, and the matter failed again. Lawyer Li then said that the defendant Zai Jinbiao kidnapped</p>
<p>Sheng Sheng Ranch</p>
<p>Owner Shen Jiucheng at 10:11 AM on August 24 last year. Shen's family lived at 500, Lane 541, Anhe Temple Road and had a car with license plate number 3735. Every morning, he went to Sheng Sheng Ranch at 175 West Avenue. On that day, he was kidnapped outside Lane 133, Columbia Road. It was not until November that he was released. After Dai Jinbiao was arrested, he confessed that he had met Zhang Aliu at the Tongxing gambling house in Caojiadu because he liked to gamble. Zhang told Dai that they were planning to kidnap Shen Jiucheng and asked Dai to join them. Dai agreed, and they acted on August 24. At that time, Dai</p>
<p>carried a load of straw</p>
<p>on his shoulder to block Shen's car and kidnap him. Zhang told Dai that he had received a ransom of 120,000 yuan and gave Dai 10,000 yuan. Judge Liu interrogated Dai and ordered him to be detained for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>A Foreigner Committed Suicide on Hongqiao Road</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been cases of foreigners committing suicide in this city. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, a foreigner suddenly hanged himself from a tree in a cemetery on Hongqiao Road.

<p>Four tourists, two men and two women, all from the upper class, came to the Wengzhou Hotel at 70, Lane 589, Lafayette Lane, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession the day before yesterday. They chose room 18 to stay in. Yesterday morning, another man and a woman came and talked behind closed doors for a long time. It is unknown how, but suddenly one of the male guests used the phone to call a friend, Mr. Jia, saying that he needed 20,000 yuan immediately. The tourist's relative, Mr. Jia, immediately called the patrol. The patrol immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest all the male and female tourists in the room for investigation. It is heard that the victim of the extortion is named Wang Zijing, and the matter involves a love affair.</p>

The New Zha, Xiehe, and Yindu gambling dens were all searched by the Japanese army. As a result, all the staff and gamblers in the three gambling dens were arrested. The reason is unknown. It is generally speculated that it may be related to the sniper attack on Japanese sentries in the area on the 28th of last month.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Suspects Arrested in Hotel</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple Patrol Detectives Yang Fusheng, Xian Chengming, Liang Junshan, and others arrested Zhang Zhongdong, Ma Hongjun, Gu Jun, and three others from Nantong in room 209 of the Weizhi Hotel at 536 Jiujiang Road at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Because they were suspected of being involved in a kidnapping for ransom case, they were brought to the patrol station together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Patrol Lawyer Li Zhishan described the case, saying that Zhang Zhongdong's father was kidnapped in the Jinsha area of Nantong, and Zhang contacted the ransom procedures in Shanghai. Gu Jun had obtained 5,000 yuan from Zhang Zhongdong. Now, because the case still needs to be investigated, he requested permission to detain them. Zhang and others hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appear in court, denying everything. The court approved the detention and adjourned the hearing for seven days for further review.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Resumption of Navigation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Still Face Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, which has been suspended for a long time since the Japanese occupied Ningbo, is reportedly being discussed by various Japanese shipping companies to resume. According to reports, a Japanese ship has already made a trial voyage from Ningbo to Shanghai four days ago, which will be a prelude to the resumption of regular shipping in the future. However, according to relevant sources, the resumption of navigation may encounter many difficulties. All the wealthy families in Ningbo have now moved to other places, and only a few poor people remain in the city. These people have no need to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo. Moreover, since Ningbo was occupied, it is feared that no one will want to return to their hometown. According to reports, cargo transportation along the Zhejiang coast has been suspended because the Chinese authorities have ordered the blockade of all waterways and harbors, prohibiting passage. At present, the Chinese army in Zhejiang and Fujian is actively counterattacking, and fierce battles have broken out in various places near Ningbo, Zhuji, and Yongjia.</p>

<h3>Correcting the Attitude Towards Learning</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Many children often ask themselves: "How can I make my knowledge continuously improve?" Today, I will express some personal opinions based on this question. The first thing I want to say is that most of your attitudes towards learning are not yet on the right track. Now, let's start by discussing a few points.</p>
<p>Children! Are you studying medicine to seek your own knowledge, or are you studying for your parents or teachers? You certainly won't answer me that you are studying for your parents or teachers. Then why don't you pick up a book to read unless you are urged by your parents or supervised by your teachers? Of course, there are such children, but they are probably in the minority.</p>
<p>The second point that should be corrected is that you must never be shy when seeking knowledge. I have seen several elementary school students who are shy when asking their teachers questions from the books in the classroom, as if they can't get a word out. I really don't understand why they are so shy. The result of being shy will definitely affect their academic performance!</p>
<p>Now is spring, don't children like to fly kites? The higher the kite flies, the happier you are. Dear children! Seeking knowledge is just like flying a kite! After learning arithmetic, there is algebra, after learning algebra, there is trigonometry... Learn one more point and know one more point. You must never be satisfied with learning only a few points. There is often a phenomenon in schools where students in higher grades often think that their knowledge is already rich, so they despise students in lower grades! These students will one day find that they are wrong!</p>
<p>If you correct your attitude towards learning and are willing to work hard, your knowledge will definitely improve continuously! I hope all the children will work hard!</p>
<h3>Taking Notes</h3>
<p>— Yinhua</p>
<p>The class leader ran in from outside and said to the classmates: "Today, Chinese teacher Mr. Li cannot come to class because he has something to do at home. Everyone should study quietly on your own"! At this time, most of the students really lowered their heads and began to read or write, but some naughty students started to make noise or scream. The class leader felt embarrassed, but luckily he quickly came up with an idea. After a while, he suggested to everyone: "Oh, classmates! I remembered, isn't Pan Xiaojuan the most hardworking and best-performing student in our entire grade? Don't all the teachers praise her? Then can't we take this opportunity to ask her to talk about her study methods? What do you all think"? Before he finished speaking, a chorus of approval immediately erupted, and all the classmates focused their eyes on Xiaojuan, watching how she would react.</p>
<p>Of course, she was shy and blushed, unwilling to get up. Some classmates nearby waved at her, some winked and stuck out their tongues, all urging her to go up quickly. As a result, she was finally dragged up by Ying, who sat next to her, and had to walk to the stage.</p>
<p>Once she was on stage, she was no longer coy. She put on a serious face and began to speak, her voice was quite loud.</p>
<p>"I am very grateful for everyone's praise for my academic progress and for asking me to talk about my study methods. Actually, I am not very hardworking. The method I use is nothing more than "taking notes" that Mr. Li has talked about in the past. Indeed, the effectiveness of taking notes is great, especially in helping our memory!..."</p>
<p>"Well, we cannot deny that we always remember a big discount on the scattered but important words, sentences... etc. that the teacher says in class. At this time, we need to use "notes". On the one hand, it can concentrate our attention, and on the other hand, it can enhance our memory and impression. In other words, the effect is several times greater!</p>
<p>"As for the method of taking notes, it is even easier and more extensive, because taking notes is a work that can be done anytime and anywhere. When the teacher is speaking, those difficult, fresh words, sentences, wordings, or classical narratives, the places where we are prone to make mistakes when writing essays, ... and many other things that are not easy to remember are all good materials for notes.</p>
<p>"After you get home, you can organize them, or look up the dictionary again, and add some annotations and pronunciations. Finally, make a careful deliberation and reflection... In this way, what you get is of course very rich and perfect. Therefore, when you are writing an essay, you can apply it very freely, and progress will naturally be fast!...</p>
<p>"Finally, there is one more thing to say: The formation of this habit of taking notes requires great perseverance and patience"!</p>
<p>The classmates who were messing around just now all nodded knowingly.</p>
<h3>Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Wenya</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a country girl whose family was very poor. Therefore, she went to work for a milk company—milking cows for them. She worked very diligently, so the company owner often praised her.</p>
<p>One day, the company's mistress gave her a bucket of milk and said to her: "You can sell this bucket of milk, get the money, and buy something you need." The girl was very happy when she heard this, so she quickly thanked the mistress, put the milk bucket on her head, and walked towards the town triumphantly.</p>
<p>On the road, she smiled all the way, thinking to herself: "What a lucky girl I am! I am going to sell this bucket of milk and buy some eggs. After I get back, I will borrow a hen from the mistress and put the eggs under her to incubate; I think the mistress will definitely allow me to. Soon, the hen will hatch a group of exquisite and lovely chicks. I will raise them, and after a year, they will all have grown very fat and big. At that time, I will sell them and definitely get more money! Then, I will go buy a beautiful dress, and it must be made of green silk. Yes! With this new green silk dress, plus a new hat and new shoes, I will become a pretty lady! At that time, I will be more noble and gorgeous than the girls on the farm. When I walk past them, I will no longer look at them. If they talk to me, I will no longer answer a word. I will stick out my chest and shake my head—like this. Ha..." As soon as the girl thought of shaking her head, she really shook her head a few times. Unexpectedly, the milk bucket on her head immediately fell down after she shook her head like this. All the milk in the bucket was spilled on the ground. So, she stood by the side of the road and cried loudly. The fantasy in her heart also disappeared with it.</p>
<h3>Can Plants Feel?</h3>
<p>— Yesuo</p>
<p>Dear children! If I were to ask you, "Can plants feel?" I think you would definitely answer me, "No, they cannot. Plants have neither brains nor central nervous systems, so how can they feel like animals?"</p>
<p>However, children! Your answer is indeed wrong. You should know that some plants possess special cells that can sense external stimuli and vibrations.</p>
<p>In Brazil, there is a plant called Mimosa pudica. If you blow on it or touch it with your finger, it immediately closes its leaves and droops down, as if a person is lowering their head in shyness. Therefore, people call it Mimosa pudica.</p>
<p>Besides Mimosa pudica, there is also a plant called Hydrangea macrophylla. Its stamens are exceptionally sensitive. As long as you touch it lightly, its stamens will immediately contract.</p>
<p>Children! Do you find these two plants strange? Do you want to see them once? While Hydrangea macrophylla may not be easy to find, Mimosa pudica can be seen in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Two Methods of Making Plaster Models</h3>
<p>— Kun</p>
<p>Xiao Lin saw that his classmates at school mostly had plaster models. They used wax to cast little cats, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, ... and he couldn't help but feel envious. So he asked his father to buy him one. His older brother, Da Lin, heard this and chimed in, "I'll make one for you!" It turned out that he had learned how to make models. Xiao Lin's original desire was just for one model. Now, seeing that his brother had agreed to make one for him, he was very happy. So Da Lin went to buy the materials—plaster powder and a celluloid toy. When he came back, he put the plaster powder in a pot and stir-fried it for a while, then poured it out. Then he found a suitably sized cardboard box.</p>
<p>With everything ready, Da Lin began to work. He first coated the celluloid toy with a thin layer of Vaseline, then mixed the plaster powder with water to make a slurry (neither too thin nor too thick), poured it into the box, and placed half of the oiled toy into it. In an instant, half of the plaster model was made. He took it out, trimmed it a bit, and used a knife to carve out a square piece of plaster on the side.</p>
<p>Xiao Lin watched in a daze, but he didn't understand why the plaster powder had to be stir-fried? Why did the toy have to be oiled? And why did a square piece have to be carved out of one side of the model? Finally, he couldn't wait to ask his brother.</p>
<p>Da Lin agreed and, while pouring some more plaster powder into the box, explained to him, "Because the plaster powder I bought is raw plaster powder, it still contains some moisture. Stir-frying it evaporates the moisture, making it mature plaster powder. After this step, the model will dry faster. Coating the toy with oil prevents the plaster from sticking to it, so you can't take it out. As for why a square piece is carved out of half of the model and trimmed? Because this makes the model fit together better; the cast wax figure will also be more lifelike." At this time, the plaster model was complete. The toy was also taken out. There was a lot of plaster powder left, so Da Lin broke open the toy with a knife, also coated the inside with Vaseline, poured in some more plaster powder, waited for it to be half-dry, put the two halves together, pinched them tightly, and after it dried, removed the toy. A snow-white plaster model appeared before his eyes. Da Lin handed them to his younger brother. Xiao Lin held the two models and ran off joyfully.</p>
<h3>The Poor Man Buying Cheap Rice</h3>
<p>— Shizi</p>
<p>At noon, Ming'er carried his schoolbag home, running with skips and jumps. When he reached the corner of the road, there were many poorly dressed people, lined up as if they were doing gymnastics class at school, but in their hands, they all held a tattered bag or basket. There were old women and little girls, tall ones and short ones, but unlike the gymnastics class at school, they weren't lined up neatly according to height. Ming'er felt very strange. He carefully followed the strange line of people and saw a piece of white paper pasted on the wall around the corner, with the words "Cheap Rice for Sale" written on it. Ming'er thought this was a rice-selling shop, but why did people have to line up to buy rice? Ming'er didn't understand! He decided to go ask his brother, so he quickly ran home.</p>
<p>Zhao'er had also just come home from school. He saw Ming'er running in urgently, grabbed his arm and said, "Brother, when I came back from school, I saw many poor people on the road, lining up to buy rice in a restaurant. Do you have to line up to buy rice?"</p>
<p>Zhao'er also often passed that place on his way home from school, so he understood as soon as he heard. He told Ming'er to let go of his hand and said kindly, "This is a place to buy 'cheap rice', not a restaurant..."</p>
<p>"Cheap rice', that's right! I saw a sign on the wall that said, 'Cheap rice for sale'." Ming'er said happily.</p>
<p>"But you don't know what 'cheap rice' means, so you mistook it for a 'restaurant'. 'Cheap rice' is rice that is very cheap. A group of philanthropists, seeing how high the price of rice is, and that the poor can't survive, had a good idea. They cooked white rice and told the poor to come and buy it, and the price is much cheaper than elsewhere. So ordinary rice in a restaurant costs two dimes a bowl, but at this 'cheap rice place', you can buy a pound of rice for a dime. Because the people running this 'cheap rice place' intend to help the poor, they not only don't make money on the rice, but they're probably losing money."</p>
<p>As Zhao'er said this, their mother called them to eat lunch. The two brothers walked hand in hand to the living room to eat. Zhao'er held a bowl full of white rice and said to Ming'er, "Little brother, we eat ready-made white rice every day and don't know that many poor people are eating 'cheap rice'; even more poor people have no rice to eat and are starving to death on the streets."</p>
<p>Ming'er nodded, indicating that he agreed with his brother's words. His mother looked at them strangely and asked what they were talking about. Zhao'er told his mother what Ming'er had seen. His mother couldn't help but say solemnly, "Good children, it's good that you can care about the lives of the poor; but this 'cheap rice' still has to be bought with money, and many poor people don't have money; they can only starve to death. So to thoroughly help the poor, you have to make sure that every poor person has enough money to buy 'cheap rice'; this money needs to be given to the poor by every person with a conscience."</p>
<p>Zhao'er and Ming'er quietly listened to their mother's words. Ming'er silently put his hand into his pocket, took out a one-dollar bill, handed it to his mother, and said sincerely, "Mom, I don't want to use your money to buy candy anymore. Please give this dollar to that Jiangbei child in the alley. I saw him swallowing chaff once."</p>
<p>Zhao'er also took out the one dollar his mother had given him, handed it to his mother, and said to Ming'er, "Little brother, we should not only do this today, but we should do it every day."</p>
<p>Their mother gently continued, "That's right, you must think of the poor every day and not be selfish people!"</p>

<h3>Guan Opera</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, the performance of Guan Opera was prohibited. Therefore, although many talented leading male actors emerged, only a few, such as Mi Xizi and Cheng Changgeng, were known for their Guan Opera roles. At that time, Beijing opera tunes were simple, focusing solely on singing skills. Mi and Cheng's performances were initially of a supporting nature, not exclusively specializing in this red-face role. According to old traditions, the earliest performer of Guan Opera was Yu Sisheng. Yu, a native of Shitai, Anhui, initially joined the Chuntai Troupe. However, due to his poor voice, he had no reputation and often ruined performances with off-key singing. He eventually retired and pondered ways to gain recognition. Before long, he suddenly rejoined Chuntai, visited the troupe leader, and requested to perform again. When asked about the play, he chose "Battle of Changsha." The troupe leader, pitying his situation, agreed. On the day of the performance, a large audience gathered. Yu Sisheng didn't apply makeup backstage but drank dozens of cups of wine without getting drunk. When the curtain rose, Yu Sisheng strode out with his sword, his energy surging, his face as red as a rainbow, dignified and solemn, his presence captivating the audience. They praised him greatly. From then on, his singing, acting, reciting, and fighting were all impeccable. He was no longer the listless and disheartened performer of the past. Since then, Yu Sisheng became famous overnight. Cheng Changgeng, who was in the Sanqing Troupe, heard of Yu Sisheng's name and was greatly surprised. He disguised himself and went to watch. Returning, he scoffed, "Is that really skill? It's just a naturally red face." The next day, Changgeng also posted "Battle of Changsha," carefully mixing ink and vermilion, meticulously applying makeup, creating unparalleled beauty. When he performed, his singing and acting were even more outstanding. The audience, who had previously praised Yu Sisheng, all agreed that Changgeng's "Old Master Play" was the best. From then on, Guan Opera occupied a place in Beijing Opera. Tracing back to its origins, the creator of Guan Opera was actually Yu Sisheng.</p>
<p>Although Changgeng became famous for performing Guan Opera, he was restricted by the prohibition and dared not perform it often. In his later years, he collaborated with Chi Yuquan to perform "Battle of Changsha" at Tianhe Hall. Afterward, he was summoned by the censor-in-chief. At that time, Changgeng was a leading figure in the performing arts world, with a very high reputation. He had no choice but to be supported by his disciple Xu Ani to go. Ani took five lashes on his behalf before the matter was dropped. This shows how strict the ban on performing Guan Opera was at that time. Few people know about this today, perhaps it is also a precious anecdote about Guan Opera.</p>
<p>Since Guan Opera was strictly prohibited during the Qing Dynasty, performers often did not seek deep understanding. In modern times, performers either lacked refinement or were too crude. It was impossible to find a complete talent. In his later years, Yang Jiang once rehearsed "Sealed Gold and Challenging the Robe" with Hao Shoushen. Hao was famous for playing Cao Cao, while Yang's Guan Yu was still a new attempt. When he appeared on stage, Yang was full of energy, neither bland nor excessive. He fully revealed Guan Yu's strong character. His makeup and recitations were also naturally exquisite, with very little artificiality or idolization. Compared to Hao's Cao Cao, it seemed to have traces of deliberate portrayal. Yang's associates regarded Yang's Guan Opera as a masterpiece, suggesting that it could not be performed again, so it was never performed again. Otherwise, the Yang school of Guan Opera could have overshadowed the Wang school, the Jing school, and the Peng school, the various schools that sing Guan Opera today.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple: Recent Life Photos</h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>Last year on this day, Hollywood was rumored to believe that Shirley Temple intended to leave the screen. But now, it has been proven inaccurate. Because after "The Blue Bird," she continued to make films, and recently MGM or RKO have reportedly borrowed Shirley Temple from 20th Century-Fox. This further proves that, at least for the time being, this child star will not leave the screen. Here, I will write about the reasons why Shirley Temple continues to make films to report to readers.</p>
<p>Nine Years in Film</p>
<p>She was on the screen at the age of three, and as of April 23 this year, she is exactly twelve years old. In these nine years, she has starred in many films, and each one has had considerable box office success. So not only has she earned a huge salary, but she has also earned a lot of money for 20th Century-Fox. At one time, the film company regarded her as a cash cow. The films she starred in had low costs and high profits and were sure to make money.</p>
<p>Preparing to Retire</p>
<p>The period for child stars is originally very short. A twelve-year-old child will soon lose the qualifications of a child star. Especially Shirley Temple is a precocious girl, looking like a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, so her mother decided last year to have Shirley Temple stop filming and leave the screen. This would allow her to go back to school for a few more years to seek a future path.</p>
<p>Canceling the Plan</p>
<p>But after this news came out, 20th Century-Fox was the first to express its retention, requesting Shirley Temple to make a few more films. At the same time, fans from all over the world also wrote letters to her mother and the film company, hoping that Shirley Temple would continue to make films. Under these circumstances, it was difficult to refuse, and Mrs. Temple had to cancel the plan.</p>
<p>Competing to Borrow</p>
<p>Therefore, Shirley Temple is still making films to this day, and recently the films she has starred in are still popular. As for the decline in box office records, it was originally affected by the war. Recently, MGM and RKO are planning to shoot the film "Panama Hattie." After it is determined which company will shoot it, it is said that they will borrow Shirley Temple to play the child role in this film.</p>
<h3>News from the Old Capital's Theaters</h3>

<h3>A True Movie Fan</h3>
<p>— Rubing</p>
<p>He Yongjin, a Chinese overseas resident in the United States, has been a movie fan since he was a child. He spends all day in the cinema watching movies, becoming addicted and fascinated, and he is still like this now. He originally ran a laundry in New York, but in order to get close to the big stars and see their style, he sold his shop and went to Hollywood to work as a temporary actor to fulfill his ambitions and wishes. He appeared in the film "Heart of a Harlot" starring George Raft, Ida Lupino, Ann Sheridan, and Humphrey Bogart. George Raft liked him very much and was willing to pay him a generous salary to be his trusted attendant, but He Yongjin said, "I hope to see many stars, and don't want to follow just one person."</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Fallen Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>He didn't expect that Li Xin could escape back to Qixian, and there was still a tragic massacre! He traveled day and night, traversing mountains and rivers, rushing to Daizhou. He learned that General Zhou Yuji was stationed here to prevent the Eastern invasion of the rebels, and of course Wang Yongtai was also here. On that day, he first checked into the inn, put down his luggage, and went to Zhou Yuji's headquarters to inquire about Wang Yongtai's news. He learned that Wang Shui Tai did not live in the yamen, but had a private residence on Wanhua Street in the city. Xu Jing inquired clearly and went to Wanhua Street to visit Wang Yongtai. He happened to meet Wang Yongtai entertaining guests in his residence. Receiving Xu Jing's calling card, knowing that the son of an old friend had come from afar, he immediately ordered the servants to invite him in, and went down the steps to greet him himself. Xu Jing saw that Wang Yongtai's appearance was much older than before, his temples were already gray, but his spirit was still strong. He was wearing a Tianjin blue satin jacket and black boots, with a friendly smile. He quickly bowed to him. Wang Yongtai hurriedly returned the greeting, helped him up himself, called him a virtuous nephew, and invited Xu Jing to take a seat, and introduced him to everyone, praising him. Everyone saw that Xu Jing was handsome and outstanding, a scholar but full of heroism, worthy of a young hero, and with Wang Yongtai praising him in front, everyone looked at him with new eyes. After three rounds of wine, Wang Yongtai asked him about his family situation. Xu Jing replied that his old mother had passed away, his father in Qixian had been ravaged by bandits, and he was living in obscurity, wanting to make a career in these times, so he abandoned his pen and came to join him. Wang Yongtai nodded and said, "Virtuous nephew has come at the right time. Now the world is in turmoil, it is the time for a great man to serve the country. Wait for me to introduce you to General Zhou tomorrow, and you can serve here together. Recently, I heard that the rebels Li Zicheng and others in Guanzhong are attacking and forcing Tongguan. If Tongguan is lost, they will definitely raise their troops north to spy on the capital. Maybe this place will be the first to bear the brunt, and a battle will be inevitable. The old man is about to die, only suffering that he cannot get his death. If the rebels come to covet Daizhou, I will follow Ma Fubo and wrap my body in horse hide, vowing not to return alive." All the guests said, "With General Zhou and the old hero Wang guarding here, if the rebels come, they will surely be killed without leaving a single piece of armor." Xu Jing also said, "What my uncle said is truly old and strong, I am willing to follow the whip and work together to give the rebels a heavy blow." Everyone raised their glasses, drank happily, and dispersed. (54)</p>
<h3>Summary of the Philosophy of Diligence</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Self-improvement is an active saying, while non-cessation is a passive saying. Non-cessation is the first realm, while self-improvement is the second realm. Without being able to not cease, one cannot self-improve.</p>

<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Putian Lian Xuezheng Editor</p>
<p>Game 292: Return Attack to Resolve Danger, Proposed by Chuan Rongnian, Red First Draw</p>
<p>According to this game, also known as Deputy Seven Stars, both sides resolve the kill and return the kill to form a draw. If the red side's seventh rank has no phase, then black wins, because after the twelfth move, black horse eight advances to seven, there is a move of seven advances to five, and the red side's five-rank artillery pawn cannot move, so this game is quite meaningful. The move method will be published in the next issue.</p>
<p>Game 291 "Mud Horse Saves the Lord" Move Method Listed Below (Red First Win)</p>
<p>Pawn 3 Advances 1, Elephant 9 Retreats 7, Cannon 7 Moves to 4, General 6 Moves to 5, Horse 2 Advances 3</p>
<p>General 5 Moves to 4, Chariot 7 Moves to 6, Counselor 5 Advances 4, Cannon 4 Moves to 6, Counselor 4 Retreats 5</p>
<p>Cannon 6 Moves to 5, Counselor 5 Advances 4, Horse 3 Retreats 5, Counselor 6 Retreats 5, Pawn 7 Moves to 6</p>
<p>General 4 Moves to 5, Pawn 6 Moves to 5, General 5 Moves to 4, Cannon 5 Moves to 6, Counselor 4 Retreats 5</p>
<p>Cannon 6 Moves to 5, General 4 Moves to 5, Chariot 6 Advances 4 (Win)</p>
