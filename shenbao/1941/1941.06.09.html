<h3>美日關係之謎</h3>
<p>在最近遠東局面中最惹人注意的事件，除却已屆絕續關頭的荷印談判而外，當無過於美日關係了。隨着蘇日訂的和納粹積極東侵之後，世人意想中的美日關係惡化趨勢，僅只有時見之於日方發言人的談話以至個別的意見之中，最近雙方的外交接觸，反形頻繁，種種謠詠亦復紛傳無已，經美當局一再表明態度後，昨日合衆社的東京消息，且更有人認爲美駐日大使格魯與松岡的會談，或即係美日發動改善關係之前奏。這是吾綏靖政策之將在遠東復活，正是一個亟待解決的問題。</p>
<p>綏靖政策之在遠東，已往曾有一度的猖獗，到今天亦尙未在某些人理想中絕跡，其所以特別値得注意者並不在那些謠諑的本身，而是此際國際形勢，在客觀上正造成一個利於綏靖政策在遠束抬頭的機會。三國同盟並未替軸心獲得助力，到只是提高了日本在國際間舉足重輕的地位，姑不論美國的三洋海軍尙未全吿完成，即使在實力上已能有備無患，在戰略上，兩面作戰也是任何國家所力謀避免的，是以在美國步步走進參戰之際，如何藉改善美日關係以防範三國盟的第三條的援用，總不失爲一個很能動聽的理由。於是上週羅斯福爐邊談話之並未特別提到太平洋和遠東，便被目爲取悅日本，野村表示日本並未放棄對美改善關係的演說，亦即隨以俱來，到最近東京方面外交接觸的紛繁與活躍，這種企圖，已經是由幻想經過試探而出之於實際的運用了。</p>
<p>美日之間不是敵國或交戰國，至今仍始終保持着正常外交關係，則雙方之從事於外交接觸並沒有特別値得驚異的理由，間題只在所謂改善關係的眞相何若，以至其有如可能及其如何去謀改善。美國對於歐局固極關切，但美國同時又是個太平洋國家，並在遠東擁有重大權益，即使其對於東西局勢的看法有緩急之別，却絕難設想其竟將以截然不同的政策去分別應付，設如那樣，其將何以自解於十年來的一貫政策與積極援華的主張和設施？對於海軍幾近於零的納粹的大西洋的未來攻勢，且須加以絕大的警戒，則對於向以對付美國自命的世界第三位的海軍威脅，顯然，更不是懷柔手段所能對付的，最近十日之內，美當局曾兩度聲言對日政策不變，除對於日方企圖締結不侵協定之議加以吾認外，更於赫爾與郭泰祺的換文中昭示着美國對中國的友誼和信任，空穴來風的傳說，即使並非盡出無因，也是不能削弱這些正式文吿的效力的。固然，美當局最近亦表示政策不變，但沒有更加積極的表示，這大概就是引起謠諑以至綏靖幻想的原因，而五月二十一日赫爾另一聲明所表示的美國對於覓取日政府之和好從未採取主動地位，却明白表示着急切企求美日關係改善者不是美政府，而是另一方面。綜合連日各方消息，這一萌動已在積極進行之中，假如其所建議的性質只是在不改變遠東原有秩序的前提之下避免太平洋戰禍的擴大，大概美當局或不致峻拒過甚，因爲美國所着眼者，僅在遠東的安定與秩序的保持，而且美國原不是好戰黷武的國家；但倘竟幻想乘機進迫，想耍美方改變一貫政策，停止援華，甚至承認一東亞共榮圈」之類，則所謂改善兩國關係者只能是徒託空言。這一類的條件不只前此與日締結不侵條的的蘇聯已加拒絕，連荷印在此次談判中也迄不肯因威逼而喪失立塲，更無論美國。</p>
<p>美方現行政策固無可懷疑，但其視歐局重於遠東的觀點却是一個可乘的罅隙。其實無論侵略者如何賣弄姿態，反侵略戰爭終是整個的，絕不能加以分割。太平洋的秩序與安髯，並不繫於侵略者的善意，而全要看民治國家的戒備和實力是吾有應變的充分把握，在這一點上眞能收穫功效的是强力艦隊，是援華措施，而不是可能引起綏靖疑寳的外交談判。</p>

<h3>英軍渡沃摩河　攻陷阿巴爾蒂　扼守義軍被俘達千人　　開羅　官塲聲稱、英軍在阿比西尼亞渡沃摩河後、已攻陷阿巴爾蒂、沃摩河寬五十尺、位於廣闊平原之下、義車扼守河西高岸、地勢頗佳、但英方非洲軍隊卒冒猛烈砲火强渡該河攀登高岸、掃蕩敵哨位、而俘敵兵千人、（八日路透電）歐戰叢談（六二）　大西洋戰爭嚴重　　美國總統羅斯福日前發表歷史性的「爐邊閑談」，道及德國潛艇飛機擊沉商船率較英國的補充率，高出三倍，較英美兩國聯合造船率，高出兩倍。這可見大西洋戰爭的嚴重性了。　　英國在已往十二個月中共沉失輪船四，一五八，九八六噸，其中貨物沉失共合一四五，五六四，五一〇美元，輪船造價約合一，五〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。自開戰之日起至今年四月底止，英國及其與國共沉失輪船一千餘艘，共的五，六五一，四八一噸，貨物及輪船造價共合一，八九三，二四六，一三五美元。開戰時英國共有一千噸以上航海輪船在一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸以上，現已减至七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸。惟據「倫敦經濟家」雜誌估計，英國已自挪威等國取得輪船八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸。因之英國現有輪船一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸。（德國輪船被擊沉的共的一百八十萬噸，義大利輪船被擊沉的共的一百二十萬噸，合計的共三百萬噸）。　　在這次歐戰爆發之初，英國擁有各種商船的二千一百萬噸「註一」，旋從與國和中立國方面獲得九百萬噸，連　製造，購買，租借及據獲的三百萬噸在內，總數共達三千三百萬噸。依常理推測，英國除損失五百三十噸以外，應尙存二千七百七十萬噸之多。　　可是這個數目浮而不實。其中一大部份被海軍部徵發，用以運送軍隊軍需前往地中海，並充作護航巡邏之用。還有許多商船，不宜擔任運輸工作，如內河輪船，英倫海峽的渡船及艙位不大的載客郵船等。此外還有多數船隻，派作特別用途，不能遠涉重洋。故實際上用以載運軍需及食物接濟英國的輪船，不過一百三十萬噸　　其次，航行速率已較前减低，護航中各船祇能以速率最低的一艘爲標準，且須採取曲折航路，較平時超出兩倍時間。此一千三百萬噸商船的運輸能力，因之僅抵平時六百五十萬噸而已。　　復次，英國全部港口中，僅利物浦和克來德及塞文等港，較能充分利用。愛丁堡·新堡·赫爾·倫敦及蘇桑普敦在德國潛艇飛機集中攻擊之下，已逐漸失去其原有地位，又使商船五百萬噸左右，不能充分利用。　　事實還不如此，各造船廠裏，時常擱着重創輕創的船隻一百萬噸，等侍裝修。其中四分之一，由於普通航行損壞，其餘是由於德國破壞的結果。如此，各造船廠一方面亟需造船造艦，另一方面又要不斷修船，正有捉襟見肘之勢。　　由此種種原因，英國在名義上雖有商船一千七百七十萬噸，實際上僅有四百萬噸，可供戰時運輸海外接濟品之用。今年三月以來，英國商船損失，平均每星期十萬噸「註二」。依此比例，全年損失將達五百寓噸以匕。假定英美兩國今年最高造船率爲一百十萬噸，則英國實損二百萬噸，即等於現行運輸船隻（一千三百萬噸）白分之二十二。而實際噸位亦將减至三萬噸强。長此以往，不知伊於何底。　　在上次歐戰期間，英國對付潛艇，頗能得心應手，一九一七年四月，英國商船損失打破一切紀錄後（共三九四，七〇〇噸），設明軍艦護航辦法成效大著。一九一七年至一九一八年閒，大西洋護航隊安抵目的聯的達白分之九九·〇八〇英國的驅逐艦對於搜索敵艇，擊沉敵艇，技術高明。到戰爭結束前，驅逐艦所投的深射炸彈，十中　三，但在這次歐戰開始以來，由於兮昔情形不同，成績却並不出色。　　第一，德國攻擊力與央國防禦力的比率，今昔懸殊。上次歐戰末期，英國尙留驅逐艦四百九十六艘，並可從美國方面獲得一百艘，從法國獲得九十二艘，從義大利獲得六十七艘，總共七百五十五艘。此次戰時情形就不對了，截至今年四月下旬爲止，英國所有的驅逐艦，併美國讓與的五十艘及舊式中型巡洋艦數十艘在內，不過二百餘艘。一九一七年春間，德國潛艇實力，僅一百二十八艘，今年春季，則至少有一百八十艘，或者還不至此數。如此，德國的攻擊力已越過從前一半，英國的抵抗力反不及從前之半。　　至於英國利用主力艦護航，雖不無稍補，究竟得不償失。上次歐戰時，德國艦隊聲勢赫赫，英國主力艦不得不集中斯加坡灣，以防德艦包圍襲擊。此次戰事中，德國主力艦旣屬有限，義大利艦隊也見得虎頭蛇尾「註三」，英國始能分散艦隊，供護航之用。無如主力艦速率不及驅逐艦，不足以追擊潛水艇，僅可使敵方剽擊艦望而生畏而已。　　一九一七年至一九一八年間，英國防止德國潛艇入境，祇須守住杜佛海　處及北海口蘇格蘭與挪威中間地方，全部封鎖綫，僅長三百海里。在戰事結束以飾，全綫且滿佈水雷。此次德國佔領挪威及法國大部海岸，北起挪威那維克港，南迄法國巴育納港，海岸綫遙遙二千三百海里，德國可自由選擇攻擊根據地，英國有防不勝防之苦。</h3>

<p>第三七四期　經濟專刋看到聽到想到　　六月份本是上海的淡月。雖在非常時期，也免不了受經常的季節影響。在倐上倐落的投機在浪裹，宜其更顯出簫條萬狀。　　大家想還記得：去年五二風潮一過，就來一個六月恐慌。那時金價在十天間在瀉一千元（由三日的六四九四元跌成十一日的五二〇〇元）。二十支雙馬每包跌去六百多元（由四日的一四五元跌到十四日的八〇五元）。外股也各暴跌五六十元到二三百元。　　歷史是不會重演的，但季節是循環的。看吧：這種恐慌的季節現象，在五月底　經開始了。金價紗價都在逐步盤低，大概因爲去年的餘悸猶在，一般投機份子，不得不先事警戒吧？　　聽說近來紗價猛瀉，除了季節影響外，尙有一個特殊原因。那就是某某取引所開門迎客覿儀。他正以貶價傾銷米招徠主顧。這與鼓勵軍票投機，故意造成風潮，藉以吸引投機者注意，以助　票發行，是異曲同工的。而且客幫要進紗，常揀低廉的方面走；抑低物價，又投民心。這辦法，再巧妙也沒有。　　不過：貶價傾銷，受到貶價損失的該是自己。然在交易所市塲上實行傾銷，這就有點兒慷他人之慨了。不過平心而論，現在的紗價還是太高，還是不够說「貶」，此處之所謂「貶」，祇是指另一個雙馬市塲而言。　　糧價飛漲以來，勞資糾紛，即普及於各業之間。唯一例外的，只是米業方面。他們彼此間始終合作，實屬難能可貴。但此次工部局廉米上市而使米價回平之初，米業間忽就發生空前的「不合作」風潮。幸工部局處理適當，旋即復工。但其居心何如，不能不令人滋生疑實。現聞工部局正在爲之調解中，想工部局當不致墜入詭計也。縣鄉金融改建問題  李一氷　　我國新式的金融機構，不僅在地域的分配上，一個偏在沿海數省的大都市，所有業務上的活動，亦皆以都市商工企業爲其主要的對象，而且，由於其他種種國民經濟不平衡發展的結果，資余偏在的現象，又復變本加厲，都市裏經常的壅塞了大量的游資，無法消納，而廣大的縣鄉村鎭，郤患着極嚴重的貧血症候。　　雖然，戰前幾年，上海的銀行界也曾熱烈鼓吹過資金歸　的口號，一方面竭力推廣分發行處的設立，一方面積極提倡辦理農貸；但是，論到推行的成效，眞是微乎其微。從表面上看，銀行分發行處的數字，固然增如了，然而分布的區域，却仍然只限於商業繁盛的小城市，而主要的業務，雖然是以農貸爲中心，郤因時期的短促，數額的微小，貸放對象不甚正確並沒有做到調劑平民金融其正的任務，甚至還有當地商業資本勾結起來，成爲縣鄕金融的吸血管，吸收縣鄉屬有的　力，萬流歸海地滙集到大都市來「浮游」的，所謂「地方經濟平衡保管權限」這一使命，顯然的並不能由普通銀行所能確實做到的了。　　本來普通私人銀行原是一種營利的企業，當然其業務的推展，必須以企業的利益爲前提；資金的性質，原來像水，水往下流，資金總往利息較高的處所走，縣鄉余融的對象，旣是以利益增殖率較低，中長期的農業信用爲主，就是地方小工業和地方販運組織工商信用授受，一般的要受生產環境的限制其利益，決不能和大都市的投機買賣等量齊觀，貸放購限更不能如都市商業短期信用的敏捷活潑，所以，新式銀行之偏在都市，原是理所當然的結果，因爲私人金融業一則不能遠背它的營利原則，二則不能不顧到本身資金運動時地的限制，自然不能儘量以低廉利息，較長時期作充分的縣鄉貸放的了。　　再從經營的技術上說，縣鄉金融的存放大都是是小額授受的多，手　瑣碎煩雜，已經困難重重，而且從過去辦理農貸的經騐，一般縣鄉人民不善利用新式金融機關，而新式金融機關也沒有改善其手續上的繁難，所以一般人的融資需要，大部分還是揑在私人高利貸和典當的手裏，據戰前中央農業實騐所的調查，農民借款的來源，人和人，商店和典當三　爲最，佔百分之八十九以上，一般商店的融資，又多在錢莊的領域之內，至於後起的信用合作社，不但數量少，地域分布狹窄，而且無可諱言的其中還有很多是抓在土豪劣紳手上，成爲剝削的新工具，縣鄉實際的生產隊伍，仍然要在三五分以上的高利貸剝削之下生活。　　戰前的情形是如此，戰後的縣鄉金融的實况又是如何呢？自從戰事在沿海地域首先發動以後，一時金融機關撤退後方，資金內移，開發西南等呼聲，甚　塵上，然而，按之四年來實際的表現，除出政府銀行以外，一般私人銀行在內地設立分支行處的已經不多，眞正全部撒退後方的必其寥若晨星，其中即有少數從上海內移的銀行，其一般業務的方針，也還是徘徊觀望的居多，擺了一個門面點綴而已。至於資金內移的問題，但看內地大後方對上海間的匯兌，戰後一貫的　着逆勢，滙水日高的現象，而上海銀錢業存款額的繼長增高，游資汎瀾，翻騰着空前的投機在潮的事實，就可作爲一個極好的說明了。　　不過，在戰後幾年間，政府對於農業及地方金融方面，確曾力加調整，擘劃各種新的設施與計劃，允以農業金融體制的建設，信用合作社的推廣，農貸的擴大，地方金融的改進諸端，確有極進步的表現，獲有相當的基礎，此爲論及縣鄉金融現狀下，爲唯一可以興奮的事實了。　　上面將整個金融業中的略檢討過縣鄉令融所處的即位，已可看出過去金副力量偏廢程度之深刻。反轉來又不難想象中國金融業在沿海、都市畸形發展之病態，既非一國健全金融建樹之途，允非戰時國策之利。　　一國富力的根基，在於物資，物資生產能够擴充，再生產週轉速率能够增加，國民財富的積蓄目然也能跟着增進起來，平時固然如此在戰時由於戰火之猛烈的破壞，以及軍需消耗之大量增加，對於物資補充的需要允其急迫。然而要積極促進生產量，擴大生產領域，當然不能離開物資蘊藏的根基——廣大的縣鄕區域。生產的三個條件是土地勞力和資本，以我國縣鄉區域之廣大的土地，充沛的人力，豐富的地力和蘊藏，原是具　極優美的天賦，只是不能沒有資金這一個要素，因此，縣鄉金融的建設可說是國民生產經濟建設的前提，共重要是不難想知的了。　　其次，我們說到縣鄉金融趙設任務之担當主體問題。　　如上所述，私人銀行限於本身企業利益慾望的限制，本身資金運動常規的阻礙，自然不能圓滑担任這個仟務的全部。就以農業信用爲例，現在歐　各國不是由政府參加資本，予以財政上的幫助，也大多具有統一的中樞組織，由政府直接予以保護，獎助和監督。所以，建設縣鄉金融的主體，當以公營爲是，尤其在基礎貧弱的我國爲然。　　但是，以我國縣鄉區域之　大，當然不是僅由政府的資力就可以普設縣鄉的金融網絡，所以，我們從推廣縣鄉金融機構及其資金來源說，覺得原有的地方金融組織及地方固有富力，確是創造當　的一個主要的基石。　　縣鄕金融從大體的比重上考察，固然是偏廢已甚，然而，一則以政府近年推行農業金融之努力，信用合作之規模初具，都足爲創建之助；二則各省地方銀行及固有銀錢行號的存在，此種原有的地方金融組織，皆足爲推行縣鄉金融機構的重要的基礎。不過因爲在過去缺乏一個嚴整的體制，沒有個堅强有力的中樞組織，以致有的限於本身資力的薄弱，無法獨立發展其業務，有的是管理不善，人謀不减，以致組織陷於散漫，益以缺乏資金投放的利益保障，每每趦趄不前，甚且歪曲了應負的使命，所以，我們若以組織和資金兩方面來考察，以爲原有地方金融機構儘可利用，不過要加以澈底改組，尤在合併組織，務使集中資力，一致步調，加以中樞機構之扶助業務的淮行和保護業務的利益，嚴密業務的監督要比疊床架屋的另起爐灶，要來得事半功倍。　　至於資金來源方面，則地方金融組織因有的資力若加聯合在一致步調下運用於本地的生產事業，數目當不在少，即有貧弱縣鄉，則可由中樞組織酌　投資，而且由於業務的擴展，存款的吸收，儲蓄的獎勵，以及縣鄉的死藏資金的轉化，都可視為主要的來源。再說得稍遠一點，縣鄉生產事業的發展，旣足以提高一般國民的蓄積力量，而戰後由於農產品價格的高昂，目前農村的蓄積力量已遠非戰前可比，這又是當前創建縣鄉金融的一個極好的時機。　　要確實做到以地方資力開發地方產業，才能確實實現「地方經濟平衡保管權限」，以阻抑資金集中都市的病態發展。要資力平衡發展於全面的縣鄉，才能使金融和機構的偏在獲得自然的矯正。此不但於戰時的促進生產平衡物價有着重大的意義，即於建國前途，亦為一個重要的基礎。　　最近財政部創設縣鄕銀行，即以利用地方資力開發地方富源，輔助縣鄉原有余融機構爲主旨的一個偉大的擘割。總行已在重慶成立，資本總額為國幣二千萬元。　　該行創立的意義，以及在戰時與建產各方面的重要性，上已詳言。茲再就該行組織及業務與管理三方面，略加檢討。　　縣鄉銀行在組織方面，並不採用一般的分支行制度，而是採用母公司性質的銀行，對於各省的縣鄉銀行，只是參加一部分資本，在各省設立辦事處，從事輔導。　　在原則上說，各地縣鄉銀行既係由各地原有的金融組織改編而成，自不能失去其組織上的獨立性，而採用分支行制度，然單一銀行制則在管理上因缺乏統屬與聯縈，罅漏甚大，所以縣鄉銀行在組織上採用企業組織形態的母公司的制度，原不失爲一個折衷的辦法。不過，鑒於過去地方金融的散漫，薄弱以及業務經營的未上軌道，我們以為目前至少在組織上應注意兩點：第一，應該運用政府統制的力量與決心，務將地方固有的金融機構，加以合併，統一在一個組織機構裏面，以增强資力人才的運用，以克服力量分散組織散漫的流弊。第二，在組織系統的運用上，不以輔導爲已足，應採取有效直接的管理，以增强企業經營的成效，務使業務管理上具有堅强的統屬關係，以利業務推行之正確，敏捷和有效。（未完）絲繭新聞知識　—滬江大學商學院「商業新聞」敎材—　　在戰前，上海的絲商們一到現在，就要突然忙起來。現在只好看着日本人忙。這是中國蠶絲業戰時的最大特徵，但除此之外，關於絲業上的一般事情，則並無不同。　　我國是世界絲業的祖國，但現爲日意法等後來居上。可是我國產區廣大，人力廉富，只要急起直追，不難收復失地。　　繭　蠶種系統，普通分中國種，日本種，意國種。華蠶繭橢圓形而大，日本種中央細而兩頭橢圓。色澤上則分白色，黃色。黃繭蠶易飼，但出品差，白繭爲絲業的主體。此外有所謂同宮繭者，即　蠶合結一繭，同功宮絲緒紊亂，須用特種機器繅製。　　蘭質的品位，決定於色澤，形狀，絲量，舒解，乾燥，類節。而以絲量多寡，最堪重視。普通每繭的重量的自一·八至二·四公釐，絲層量的佔一九％，絲量的佔一四％，但以蠶種的不同，產絲量並不一致。中國蠶繭，佳種每四扣半毛繭，可得絲一担，歐洲種每十二斤可產絲一斤，日本種則每十六斤產絲一斤。　　蠶種戰前，我國政府已注意繭種的改良，曾指定優秀的原蠶種有下列多種。　　一化性者有翰桂，洽桂，西洽，西巧，西皓，東庚，化桂一號，化桂二號等。　　二化性者有華五，華六，華七，瀛眞等。　　所謂一化性，即一年一世代之春蠶，二化性即一年兩世代（即二熟）的夏秋蠶。根據優生學，頗多以異種交配來改良蠶種了。經試騐結果，下列各雜交種的成績最不差：即翰桂與華五，翰桂與華六，華六與西巧，華五與西洽，西皓與洽桂，東庚與洽桂，洽桂與華六，瀛眞與華七，化桂一號與華六，化桂一號與華六。　　繭市　鮮蘭上市，可分春夏秋二期，春繭最重要。次爲秋繭。江浙二省春繭上市，大抵在五月中旬開始至六月上旬爲止，前後不過二星期左右。浙江的杭，紹，嘉，湖與江蘇的蘇，錫，常，宜興，洞庭山，江陰，溧陽等等，都係重要市塲。上海絲廠都派員前去設行收繭，當地有繭行收繭以出售絲廠爲業者。　　繭價　繭質的優劣爲決定繭價的要素。破殼繭，汚繭都作廢繭價計算，不能和潔凈而完整的繭價同日而語。　　構成繭價的第二個要素是絲價。就理論上說：絲價是繭價與繅絲工價的總和。所以從絲價裹减去工價後便是原繭的代價。所以一般評定繭價的算式是　　日本評定繭價普通所用的公式叫「掛」，按每十六貫（每貫重六·二五日斤，合得一百日斤）繭價應佔其百分之十六計算，故其算式爲：　　繭價旣以絲價爲計算標準，則絲價賤時繭價必賤。此種聯繫，常使蠶農發生損失。因蠶農除支出工資外，尙須支付桑葉價。若桑貴而繭賤，就有虧蝕之虞。我國絲業近年之所以衰退，即因日絲傾銷，世界絲價慘跌，以致繭價下降，蠶農無利可圖，乃相率放棄此業所致。故以絲價計算繭價，良非獎勵養蠶之道。　　包裝與單位　繭＼包裝，視運送遠近而異。通常用蔴袋而納入竹籠。爛繭則用蔴袋而箍以鐵條。裝包前必先殺蛹。每包重量大致百斤內外，叫價單位亦按担計，零星交易則以斤計。　　生絲名稱　（一）白土絲，（二）黃土絲，均用土法繅製者。（三）白絲經，一稱花車乾經，一稱平車大經：浙湖之輯里

連一個人的生活都要發生問題，那裏還有這許多閒功夫去考慮一個人的健康呢？他們抱的是隨機應變主義，就是等病倒了再說，再來臨時設法。在未病倒之前，因健康不是主耍的問題，所以爲了生活，奔波，勞碌，日以繼夜的工作，雖明知這些是有害於健康的，但爲了生活問題，有何犧牲也是在所不惜的。　　還有一派的人，同上面所說的適成相反；因他們根本不受到生活問題的威脅，他們是富裕的，在生活上沒有什麼顧慮的。即使眞的到了米珠薪桂的時候，他們也沒有什麼困難的。他們既沒有生活上的憂慮，那末他們怎樣來應付這目前特殊的環境呢？他們的先決問題自　是享樂了，怎樣的使生活上更加舒適。這種享樂，往往是對於健康有妨礙的，好比烟酒嫖賭等等。但是他們因有金錢作爲保障，所以即使失去健康，在他們的心目中，以爲這是毫無關係的，因爲使用金錢就可以買回健康來。　　第一派的人取的是不病主義，因爲自己在已往簡直可以說是小生病的，一向好身體，有的十幾年，從不曾有天病倒在床上。一向是好身體，所以就是多受點勞累，也覺得沒有什麼　係。自信心很大，以爲決不會爲了點生活上的奔波，勞累，就會影響　他身體的健康的。因肚，根本不必去談論，或是，顧慮到健康問題了。　　讓我們現在稍爲分析一下上面所說的三派人，他們各對於健康的觀點是否正確，他們所打的算盤是吾經濟？第一派，是隨機應變派，爲了生活是先決問題，所以終日奔波勞累，置健康於不顧；但是一旦失去了健康，就又臨時抱佛脚的來想恢復健康。在這個時候，一方面因爲失去了健康不能工作，生活上，就要感到更大的因難，他方面右這種情况下，就要打算用什麽最經濟最迅速的方法來立刻恢復健康？普通爲了經濟同時間的關係，最容易走的一條路就是自療法，因爲這是最間便的，可以省掉去找醫生那種的麻煩，也可以省掉化去看　生的費用。只要一看報紙，什麼病，什麼　，應有盡有，所以只需　幾分錢，幾分鐘，這個問題都好像已經解決了。但是結果呢？能有幾個人因此得到恢復健康呢？我不能否認曾有人在這種情况下獲　痊愈的，但是這此不在他們所服的藥力，而是在於他們的休息來促成他們恢復健康的。　　有許多例子可舉。好比有一個肺癆病人，他曾用盡各種的方法藥物來醫治，結果一直沒有治好，因他不肯好好的休息，他以爲步界上還有一種神藥可以治好這病的。但是後來他偶因不愼，將腿骨折斷了，這樣使他小能不睡在牀上有相當時期的休養，結果他的肺病倒因此痊愈了。在這個時期間，休息却是治愈他的根源，藥物只不過是一種補助，但不能說就祗藥物是使他痊愈的。我們生於現在廿世紀的科學時代，我們不能運用舊的，不科學化的，簡單的頭腦來斷定事實。我們不能因一兩個親戚朋友是吃某某藥好的就來斷定天下的大道理。這非要有千千萬萬的確實根　後方能下斷語的。　　上面所說的還是那些自療者極少數而有運氣的。不幸的確佔多數，因此永遠喪失了健康的實也不在少數。當現在醫學雖是很發達的時候，往往對於一個病症，雖經過很詳盡的檢查，也常時斷不定是什麽病來，因此也不敢妄用藥物；何况一個普通不是醫界的人，怎能够就此自己診斷而妄自食藥呢？這豈不是害了自己嗎？往往由小病轉成大病，大病促成死亡，鄉末這豈不是打的倒算盤嗎？　　第二派是以爲有了金錢，可以隨便放肆自已的生活。病了，有錢可以請最好的醫生，吃最貨的藥，打最好的針，這樣，要恢復健康，好像並無困難了。但是，可惜許多難治的毛病，生在窮人的身上，也生在有錢人的身上，而且許多疾病，不是金錢能夠治好的。健康的恢復，常時也非金錢能够買到的。往往有些有錢的人，平時一味的糟塌自己的身體，等到病重時，再米想盡方法，即使化上許多錢，立刻用飛機將世界各國的名醫都謂來診治，也一樣的無用。所以有錢，並不能保障個人的健康。</p>

<p>衣食住行留美之衣食住行  孫籌成　　徐錫華女士，（新藥業同業公會主席徐翔孫先生之次女，前年赴美國哥倫比亞大學求深造，研究敎育系，前日學成回國，　藥業巨子屠開徵，高培良，許冠羣，袁鶴松等，在大西洋菜社設筵公宴，表示歡迎，酒至半酣，由劉步靑君致歡迎詞後，請錫華女士發表留美心得。徐女士所說，關於衣食住行者居多數，用特錄實本刋，以享閱者。（以下皆徐女士所說。）　　美國婦女所穿之衣，質料與做工之價格，均較我國高貴，我國留學生，大都西裝，間有少數穿中裝者。（男子完全西裝），余見都市中，我國女同胞穿旗袍者頗多，故爲求舒適起見，亦常着中國式之旗袍；一日至鄉下，則大受其累。蓋都市中眼光較大，五方雜處，已成習慣，異樣服裝，不以爲異，鄉村中人，見識不廣，見余身穿旗袍，認爲從未見過，僉尾隨余後，以觀究竟，如外國人之到我國窮鄉僻壞被人包圍一般，致使余難以爲情，侷促不安，一霄蔽之，少見多怪耳。食則居家甚簡單，早上僅進麥糊與牛奶少許，中午　食麵包數塊，所有猪排牛排，燒來不若我國之入味，且並不常吃，夜問校講究，但亦不若上海西菜館中大菜樣數之多，不外油炸淸燒而已。所食之蘿葡靑菜等，花樣既不如我國之多，其味亦不若我國之美，均以淸水白燒，而不以油煎以佐醬醋，故余平素所食之菜，均親自烹調，仍有故國風味。住因係小家庭制，故房屋最多每宅亦不過數間而已，不若我國之有高廳大屋，如大廳客廳轎廳等平素無用，而任其空關者。（此指國民住宅而言，政府機關，與公共團體之房屋，則美輪美奐，當麗堂皇，）余寄居之處，僅一老婦，雖有子女，均不同居一處，僅每逢星期日，一來省視耳，世來時如賓客然，不若我國母子之親熱，絕無天倫樂趣。因僱僕工資昂貴，且每日須給以自由鐘點，不能任意指揮，故主婦親自工作者多。此老婦聞我國尙大家庭制，重數代同堂，兒女有昏定晨省等禮節，似頗艷羨。行因交通便利，道路縱橫，故車輛甚多，公共汽車與電車，均無賣票員，每輛僅一開車耳。因其車資不論遠近，價格一律，上車時投以規定之車資於筒內，門自能開，全係機器作用，故無須用人管理，自無舞弊等不法行爲。上車下車，秩然有序，無爭先恐後等弊。乘輪回國時，因節省經費，而坐三等艙，人甚嘈雜，且皆賭博，賭具花機甚多，據云有一幫人專恃此以生活者，害人不淺，殊堪浩歎。派力司與派力布  陶賢雄　　天氣一然派力司就開始活躍起來，無論在每一個角落裏，男的女的都愛穿這純毛織的舶來品，四大公司及大小綢布店的櫥窗裏也滿佈着這時髦的撈什子，如果你去一問價錢，會使你倒吹一口冷氣，因爲挺起碼非費去半担米的代價不可。　　這個年頭，有錢的當然是滿不在乎，可是　我這　窮措大，當然需要認識與打算。　　我受到熱的威脅，不得已將夾袍脫下，然而這夏初用的單袍，倒是少不來的，假便要學時髦呢？那要算派力司最適宜，既輕使，又大方，但是爲了經濟　係我沒購買能力，並且我也不願利權外溢，而穿這外國貨的派力司，於是決定做了一件國產的派力布，昨天第一次穿上，很爲欣喜。　　下午有事踏上馬路，縱目一看滿街男女也都穿上這一套，一逼視才知穿外國貨的要佔十分之八九，跨上汽車四面一看，穿那個的更多而且件件都是毛貨（即舶來品也）。而我的長衫嬲在當中一看就看得出是布的。同時一陣輕蔑的眼光，好像一條帶刀的閃電有力的向我射來，起初我有些相形見絀起來。但是仔細一想，覺得他們自己輕視自己的舉動，何足道哉，於是挺起了胸膛，正襟危坐。　　不過輕蔑我的朋友，假使你跑到陪都，昆明去看看，那邊穿的都是國產布，若像你一　喜歡奢侈，喜歡虛榮，說不定被認爲不愛國的糊塗蟲哩！我想在上海不久的將來，人人都得穿國產布，等着吧！朋友！那時恐怕輕侮你的人不止我一個呢？（酬費捐難民）天厨食譜　（五九）（一〇五）綠漪湯  方衡擬稿　　　預備…鷄毛菜　毛豆子　香菌　扁尖　蔴油味精　鹽　　製法…將毛豆子先矮酥，然後加入充份之水續煮，沸後，將香菌，扁尖（香菌扁尖須先泡軟，洗凈，其梗）放入，趁手加以適量之味精及鹽，少頃，卽將鷄毛菜放入，復待其沸，卽可盛起，澆麻油少許，其味鮮美而所費殊　，惟鷄毛菜勿宣煮之過熟，放入後一滾卽成，否則易成黃色。（一〇六）冬菰肉圓湯  方粒稿　　　預備…鮮猪肉　冬菰　火腿　竹筍　葱　薑味精　料酒　鹽　醫油　白糖　　製法…猪肉，竹荀，葱，薑先分別切細，再併攏剁成細泥，和以適量之味精，醬油，料酒，白糖等拌勻，趁手揑成與冬菰彷彿大小之肉球。另把冬菰泡軟後洗凈，摘去梗脚，在每一肉球上合冬菰一隻，然後置入鍋內，加充份水量及火腿片，竹筍片與鹽少許煮之，數滾後卽盛起佐膳，其味之好，淸，嫩，鮮，三美俱備也。一星期家常菜單  華英女士　　諸君…如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及油，鹽，醬，醋者，請撥電話「四四五九四」，當即專差送率，不取送力　　這幾天的菜市上，關於蔬菜一類，倒有兩樣便宜的東西，一是捲心菜，每斤不過七八分左右，二是洋葱，每斤不過一角半左右，我們在經濟的立塲上，大可多買些來吃，况且這兩樣東西，又是富於維他命，吃了很有益於身體的。捲心菜的做法，葷素皆宜，輩的可以炒肉片，可以包肉，可以做　宋湯式的牛肉湯。素的可以單純紅燒，可以做酸辣菜，可以和着麵筋邊尖香菌等做紅燒素十景。洋葱的做法雖較少，但是洋葱炒牛肉絲，是多數人愛吃的，你要是不吃牛肉，那麽以猪肉爲代，亦無不可。　　星期一　　捲心菜肉片　黃瓜炒時蝦　乾絲炒蓊菜　麻醬拌茭白　　星期二　　洋葱牛肉絲　生煎鳳尾魚　雪菜黃豆芽　靑菜炒綫粉　　星期三　　刀豆炒肉絲　莧菜黃魚羹　乾絲金花菜　葱油葡蔔絲　　星期四　　番茄牛肉湯　蝦仁蛋花湯　雪菜蠶豆沙　香椿拌豆腐　　星期五　　捲心菜肉片　紅燜烏鲴片　素油豆腐湯　淸炒蓬蒿菜　　星期六　　茶豆芽鴨絲　番茄燴錩魚　紅燒　十景　糖醋拌黃瓜　　星期日　　咖哩雞　蒸鮝魚　炒莧菜　炒靑椒地癟蟲的威脅  煌　　戰後的上海人口激增，房屋奇缺，住的問題，頓形嚴重，想尋找一問空屋，眞非易事，因之形成無屋可居之局。其幸而早已租到房屋的人們，方私自慶幸，以爲居住可無問題；不料地癟蟲們花樣翻新，竟然想出一個房屋分宅出售的辦法。這辦法如果被他們利用起來，影響市民生活，社會安寗，其嚴重性不下於食的恐慌。　　本來上海的房租，雖也跟着物價的上漲而上漲，但是漲的、程度較低，所以住是比較好應付一些。可是現在黑心的地癟蟲們，看中了這一點，竟然運用手段，假借洋商名義，以外人作幌于，買進了一個弄堂，或是移轉經租權，然後將每幢房屋分宅出售，冀其使於成交，於是在一轉手間，可獲倍蓰之利。可是這種弄堂，早經住滿，絕對非空屋可比，經地癟蟲們這樣一操縱，勢必覓屋無從，一變而爲流浪街頭，無家可歸的難民了。即退一步說，縱令分宅不克眞個出售，亦可藉此要挾，實行任意加租，像這樣操縱房屋，實是漁利捷徑，爲計至得。這幾天報載的公共租界好幾條里弄房客們的呼籲，就可見地癟蟲們比在運用手段，使海上市民們，受着住的威脅，但是已經受盡生活煎熬的市民們，勢必因此失去其「安居」一字的幸福。米蠹損十萬人而利一己，爲法律所不許，「地癟蟲」的存心險惡，和手段毒辣，實在和米　一般無二。希望賢　的當局，和保障人民幸福的司法當局，遇有操縱房屋的「地癟蟲」利用法律時，予以正義的判決！西南的汽車  麗孫　　我在這裏所說的汽車夫，並不是公館人家的車夫，是　卡車的司機人。卡車夫在西南各省，確實出足風頭，他們的收入，即使是上海幾家大公館裏的車夫，也是望塵莫及。　　每一個卡車夫的月薪，是三百元，這還小算，須另加八元一天的出差費，一個卡車夫的正常收入，是每月五百四十元。這還不希罕，他們的意外收人，就可說驚人。譬如，從柳州到重慶，每一噸貨物的運輸費，是國幣一萬元，假使有五輛卡車在一起，每輛的戰重二噸，他們就超量的，將十噸貨物分配裝在四輛車上，餘下的一輛，就是他們的額外收入。　　當卡車經過山嶺的時候，下山時，油門就被關閉住，任它自然的瀉下去，所省的汽油，父是一種額外收入，在價値五十元一加侖汽油下，其數也相當可觀。此外，沿途搭載放客，也是一種外快。　　卡車夫的進款，實在比幾位銀行行長。委員老爺，也要好上幾倍，所以他們也揮金如土，西裝店和酒菜館是老主顧，使一般上海的車夫們，實在要垂涎三尺的。三黑水  袁松年　　韶華如逝水，炎夏季節又將臨大地矣。當此百物騰貴聲中，欲飲冰啖瓜以却炎暑，談何容易；且夏日冷飲，每易致病，欲求衛生美味而復合於經濟者，其惟一黑水乎？三黑水爲俟家傳夏日飲料良方，其製法以烏梅（中藥材店有賣）黑豆黑棗煎水，於煲一小時後，加赤沙糖，俟冷後方可飲，大略成份爲烏梅十份之二，黑豆十份之五，黑棗十份之三，若上列重量爲一斤，可煎湯七八斤，至於赤沙糖可隨各人所嗜而加入，至適可爲度，此水味極雋永，於夏日飲之，凉浸心脾，且具開胃健脾解喝補血潤腸等功效，若能藏諸冰中，或用瓶封好置冷處，可備數日需要，因糖質有防腐功用之故。此種一黑水與北平製之酸梅湯略相仿，囚酸梅湯亦以烏梅爲主要成份故也。馬氏墨妙  鄭逸梅　　昔人云；「畫有正派，須得其傳，不得其傳，筆墨雖工，難以名世也。」永嘉馬氏，以詩文金石畫畫霏聲於有淸一代者，垂二百餘年，馬孟容公愚賢昆仲，精研書畫，深得三昧，承家學之淵源，寫胸中之逸氣，偶爾揮灑，無不妙到毫顚，韻流楮素，得之者，珍同拱璧。今屆孟容逝世十週紀念，大新畫廳特搜集遺墨，花卉蟲魚翎毛走獸俱備，幷附以公愚之書畫篆刻詩文，曁其弟姪碧　，士鈐，靜娟等之畫，都二百餘件，定六月十一日至十五日，公開展覽。公愚近遵醫囑，節勞養神，謝絕筆墨酬應，此次陳列，皆近年精作，頗多非賣品。其以古璽文集聯，以漢碑陰作隸，以秦詔版作印，皆發千年之秘，允爲藝苑之奇獲；前彥詩：「張之四壁聊娛目」，滬上人士，抑何眼福之奢耶？</p>

<p>春秋地獄新話森羅殿上的故事  肅草　　森羅殿上，兩邊站着牛頭馬面。正中坐着威風凜凜的閻羅天子。他在詢問一個幼小的鬼魂：　　「咦！你怎麽父回來了？　連投生三次，怎麼這樣快就回來了。」　　「啟稟大王：我第一次投生在一個破屋裏，爸爸是個小販；媽媽一生下我，就被人雇去當奶媽，把我捺在家裏，吃又吃不飽，不滿一個月，我就病了。也不知是媽媽心腸硬，還不知是人家不放她回來，總之，她並不來照顧我。所以我就回來了。第一投生，爸爸是價人力車夫，爸爸除了我以外，還有三個孩子。當我出世以後，常看見他們相對歎氣流淚。過不了幾天，我在一個人聲寂靜的黑夜裏，爸爸抱了我，悄悄掩出鬥，把我放在一條幽暗的小弄裏。任憑風吹雨打。我哭破了喉嚨，也沒人來睬我，所以，不到兩天，我只得又回來了。　　「那麼第三次怎樣呢？」閻羅王似乎急切地要知道他第三次的經歷。　　「第三次嗎？」鬼魂哭了。「可憐我還沒有到人世，還沒有見到爸和媽，就被趕回來了。」　　「那麽你該作第四次的嘗試了。」　　「不！大王！我不願再去了。請你不要再給我受苦吧！」鬼魂苦苦的哀求。「據設陽世是花花世界，快樂異常，依我看來，比我們陰世的地獄還可怕。我寗可永久沉淪在地獄裹。不願再往陽世了。」　　「這也不是辦法！閻王緊鎖雙眉，轉身向判官問：「你也有什麽辦法嗎？否則，陰世難免有『鬼』滿之患。」判官搖了搖頭，默不作聲。森羅殿上寂靜無聲，景象更顯得陰森凄凉。過了好久，牛頭馬面似乎耐不住了，他們不等閻王的允許，就貢獻他們的意見：「如果我大王發令，去把陽世的米蠹，奸商，……一起捉來，就可以換出大批屈死的寃魂。不知大王以爲如何？」　　閻王對於這意見，並沒有加以批評，也不知道他有沒有聽見。祗是閉着眼瞬，似乎在思索解決這難題的辦法。一塲小風波  唐迭　　——衖堂雜寫　　『嘔……救命……救命……』　　『賤婊子，你叫，叫！老子敲死你！』　　『不要臉，好不要臉，打妻…嘔…打妻一世窮……不要臉……嘔…。』　　『老子敲死你，你白米飯吃飽了，來管起老子的事來了，老子愛怎樣就怎樣幹！』　　『不要臉，你有錢，玩女人，討小老婆，那裹來的錢，，……米蛀蟲，囤米……黑良心！……嘔……』　　『老子化盡心　給你們賺來了，你吃飽了白米飯就忘去了苦，替我躺衖堂去！』　　拍！拍！拍　　『你打！你打！不要臉，……打，躺衖堂也只有你躺過，……還是我救你轉來的，……忘了……打……要臉！……還要叫響些！……嘔…。』　　拍！拍！　　『攤了你什麼台，……嘔……還要叫……』拍！　　看熱鬧呀，呵，門外擠了一大羣人。　　『三好婆，哈事體？』　　『夫妻倆打相打，是常事，嘸啥好看……阿彌陀佛……跑　點，有煞，相駡　煞……阿彌陀佛……。』　！　　『你不讓我出去，窗敲破它！……哼……我跳樓，……嘔……！』　　拍！拍！　　『你再叫，敲死你！……你跳！你死了，我乾凈！』　　「死好了，好把媛弄回來啦！啦！」　　　！　　　！　　『啊呀，不好哉，跳樓，白白眼睛向上揷啦！』　　看啊，活死人！錯過多可惜。父擠了一大圈。　　趕緊打雷話，救護車！　　噹！噹！仁濟醫院近得很　　『喂，愛寳，痛哦，來，勾好我頭頸，好抱你上車！來！。）　　　走了、日光中的跑冰  徐萍作假擬的故事  揚子江　　這是一個假擬的故事　　有一個從囤積操縱壟斷居奇，而發了許多不義之財的市儈，新近將剝削來的十萬元錢，建造了一所房屋。　　第天淸早，這所新造房屋的大門口貼了一張無名榜，上向寫着：「不是從大家頭上剝削，何來這一萬元錢。」　　這發了不義之財的人，看了以後不禁惱羞成怒。於是便在各報上刊登了「懸賞一萬元，捉拿在新屋門口貼紙的人」的巨幅廣告。　　過了一天，這新屋門口又貼了一張紙：「已經刮了十萬元，那末又何來這另外的一萬元呢？」秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　（九）一個古怪的莊稼人　　他的叔父和堂兄堂嫂都是不曾見過世面的莊稼人，鄰舍中雖有幾個粗通文墨的，他又不敢隨便交往，除掉逗引小梅寳說笑之外，他簡直祇能整天的悶坐。　　後來他覺得實在不能再坐下去了，第二年春天，便晚下了長衣，照樣赤足芒鞋的走下田去，眼他堂兄和家裏幾個活計一同操作。可是他的身材本來生得很瘦小，皮膚又是特別的白嫩，再加臉上紮了那麽一大塊紗布，不但終年不見除下，而且天天換上一塊新的，看在人的眼睛裏，先是第一個不順，因此李家莊上的人，在背後差不多是沒有一個不要議論他的怪相的。　　然而日子一天一天的過去，人們因爲已經看慣了的緣故，終於也見怪不怪了。　　到得第四年的頭上，工作的鍛鍊和陽光的灼曬，已使秋海棠在外表上完全成爲一個莊人了。「秋海棠」「吳玉琴」「吳鈞」！…這幾個名字，也從不再在他眼前出現，或耳鼓上聽到了，每個人見了他，都叫老三或吳三，二十六歲前的他，彷彿已跟羅湘綺同時死去了。　　包括他的叔父和梅寳的奶媽子一起在內，再沒有人會想到幾年前還在紅氍毺上轟動九京的名角兒，就是現在這一個又瘦又黑，父憔悴，彷彿已過中年的莊稼人。　　三年來李家莊還是李家莊，一切的人和物，也依然如故，祇有秋海棠却已完全改變了。　　「一弟，這麽重的東西你還是不要抗吧！」這一天，秋海棠跟那個奶媽子的丈夫王四兩個人從田裏抬着一大籮的黃豆回來，才走進自家門口，便累得氣也喘不過來了；他的堂兄吳大正在院子裹椿棒于麵，一見便忙着奔過去把他替了下來。（一二七）請父母敎師們　注意兒童健康  莤蒂　　這是一個嚴重的迫切的要求，關於全市萬千的兒童的健康問題。這裏，先給各位介紹一段事實：　　星期一的早上，有位學生的家長，跑到我們學校裏米，他告訴着說：「我的一個十二歲的孩子，每天放學回家的時候，總是嚷着頭癢，後來經過檢查以後，才知他的頭髪裏，全是一粒粒的白點，這是頭虱，請你們注意一下。」我們得到了這個報告，便在各級裏遍查學生的頭髮，結果眞是出於意料之外，全校三百五十八名學生，倒有一百二十五名是患有頭虱的，其中允以女生居多。當時許多同事都主張停課，校長却堅持反對，他的意思是：在這苦難的時代，爲敎育者埋頭苦幹猶恐不及，豈有因小小的「頭虱問題而荒廢孩子們學業的道理？校長的見解頗是，同事們也就打銷了「停」課的成見。這問題的普後辦法，一方使患頭虱者予感隔離，以免普遍的傳染，一面協請家長們勸告男孩子一律剃光頭，女孩千之留髮，亦應在相當限度，平時並多多洗頭，注意淸潔。　　這一種不幸的現象，當不僅是我們一個學校有，其他的學校也會有。我總覺得，在今日辦小學難，辦弄堂小學更難；一幢三層樓的房子，要侷處三百多個學生，一個廂房問的敎室，擠擠全是人頭，容納學生四十名，五十名，六十名不等。而且厠所與幼稚班相接，灶間同六年級打通，嗚呼！敎育？衛生？談何容易　　然而我們也不只去責備學校，學校自有學校的因難！關於兒童的健康問題，爲父母者，也是應該負起重大的責任的。　　我們常常看到有許多家庭裏，父母同桌打麻將，置兒女於弄堂中不顧，讓他們打相打也好，亂跑亂跳也好，嗚呼！敎育？衛生？談何容易？　　兒童是國家未來的主人翁，我們爲父母者，爲敎師者，豈忍心妨礙他們的健康，殺害他們的身心嗎？</p>

<h3>British Troops Assist Free French Forces, Enter Syria and Lebanon, Guaranteeing the Liberation and Independence of Both Places, Vichy Announces Full Defense of This Mandated Territory</h3>
<p>Cairo: According to an official announcement from here, Free French troops, with the assistance of British Empire forces, entered Syria and Lebanon this morning. This military action is proceeding according to a pre-arranged plan. The entry of Allied forces into Syria began at 2:00 AM. This action is primarily political in nature, aimed at preventing German forces from using Syrian bases for any activity. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: When Free French forces, assisted by British Empire forces, entered Syria and Lebanon, the British government issued a communique declaring the reasons for taking this important step. Simultaneously, General Catroux, commander of the Free French forces in the Middle East, issued a declaration in his name, guaranteeing the liberation and independence of Syria and Lebanon. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: Lieutenant General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, commander of the Allied forces in Syria, previously commanded the British mechanized units in Libya when they advanced from Sidi Barrani towards Benghazi. He was later ordered to coordinate British forces in Greece. Recently, Wilson was appointed commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. Wilson's ancestors are quite famous in British military history. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The government formally announced today that British troops attacked Syria this morning. According to a report from the Syrian High Commissioner Dentz to Vichy, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Jebel Druze mountains south of Soueida on the Jordanian border. A government spokesperson stated, "We will maintain Dentz's position and will never yield." This statement refers to Dentz's assertion that the French forces in Syria will defend this French-mandated territory. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Official reports received here state that British troops, together with the Catroux faction, attacked Syria at dawn today from Palestine, with a force of 20,000 men. The Syrian garrison has risen to resist, and fighting is underway. According to responsible sources here, Britain's adoption of this military action and collaboration with French traitors, causing Frenchmen to kill each other, carries a heavy responsibility. As for French policy, it will continue to maintain its territories "within the realm of possibility." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to an announcement from the Vichy government, it will defend Syria with the maximum possible garrison. According to a statement from the Vichy government issued by the German official news agency, British and Catroux faction troops have declared Syria occupied by German forces and are attacking it. A man named Catroux issued a notice inciting the people of the French-mandated area to revolt against France. The French government has repeatedly stated that there are no German troops in Syria; therefore, Britain is committing another improper attack on French territory. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: As far as is known here, anti-German sentiment is extremely strong among the soldiers and junior officers of the French forces in Syria and Lebanon. If there is any resistance in the two places, it will necessarily come from the minority ruling class who still blindly follow orders from Vichy. As for whether all the people of the two places will unite under a common purpose to expel the Germans, it is not yet possible to determine. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: The headquarters of the Free French forces in London announced this morning that they have not received any news regarding the developments in Syria or Weygand's attitude towards the Free French forces' entry into Syria. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's residence, revealed that the British Ambassador to Egypt, Lampson, has issued a declaration calling on the residents of Syria to overthrow Vichy rule and join the Allies, stating that if the Syrian people do so, the British government will grant them all the rights enjoyed by free nations allied with Britain. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Vichy political figures announced this afternoon that British troops have invaded southern Syria. French officials in Syria and Lebanon, led by Dentz, are currently directing French troops to defend the safety of Syria and fight the enemy. The British troops' actions of crossing the border to provoke trouble are absolutely unjust. Such unreasonable provocations by British troops are not without precedent, such as the British military's invasion of (1) Mers-el-Kebir, (2) Dakar, (3) Gabon, (4) New Caledonia, and (5) Tahiti. In all of the aforementioned locations, there was no trace of German troops, yet they launched military actions. As for the fact that a few German planes landed at Syrian airfields, France does not deny it. The German planes were at the airfields for a very short time, which the British knew, so why bother launching military action? Former British Minister to Egypt Lampson used the lifting of the blockade of Syria as bait to lure Syria into the embrace of Britain and join the British faction, and the depth of his intention is now obvious. (Haitong Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Diplomatic circles here recently declared that Soviet newspapers have not made any comment on the situation in Iraq and Syria, indicating that the government's attitude has not yet been firmly decided. However, this does not mean that the government authorities are indifferent. It is noteworthy that the scope of the European war is gradually approaching, and the Soviet Union's position is more pivotal than in the past, so it must be especially cautious. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>General Catroux Arrives in Haifa to Command in Syria</h3>
<p>Vichy: Unconfirmed reports received here yesterday state that Free French General Catroux has arrived in Haifa and is currently aboard a British warship, preparing to command the "Free French" in the war for the French-mandated territory of Syria. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Managua, Nicaragua: Vichy Consul Dreifus here has resigned, believing that Vichy's cooperation with Germany is not in France's interest. Dreifus also said that the French residents of Nicaragua unanimously support General Catroux. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Placement of Mines Around Cyprus, One Oil Tanker Sinks After Striking a Mine, Ten German and Italian Pilots Detained in Turkey</h3>
<p>Ankara: The Germans have laid mines in the seas around Cyprus. Several mines have already been washed ashore on the Turkish coast. A Turkish small motor vessel carrying oil between two ports of that country recently sank suddenly off the coast, opposite the mainland. It was probably struck by a floating mine. There has apparently been discussion of a Turkish investigation into the sinking. Some quarters suggest that the German placement of mines is a prelude to an attack on Cyprus. Seven German pilots and three Italian pilots, whose planes were forced to land in Turkish territory, have now arrived in Ankara and are being detained. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Yesterday, a ship sent out a distress signal mid-voyage. Diplomatic circles believe it was en route to the Black Sea from here. It was probably either torpedoed or struck a mine. Reliable sources also say that Turkish anti-aircraft batteries near Bozcaada shot down an unidentified seaplane, a Dornier type, which was searching for submarines. The plane flew too close to the Turkish coast, causing the anti-aircraft batteries to open fire. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Cyprus: For the past few days, unidentified planes have frequently flown over the island at extremely high altitudes, causing alerts to be issued day and night. However, no bombs have been dropped. It is believed that these are German planes flying to Syria. Civilians on the island are still continuing to evacuate to the countryside. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Nicosia: According to news today, a squadron of German and Italian warplanes is flying from Greece to Syria via the Dodecanese Islands. Several Axis planes flew over Cyprus this morning but did not drop any bombs. It is said that the main destination of Axis planes in Syria is the Aleppo airfield, and several others are landing at the Palmyra and Damascus airfields. Although there is no sign of a large-scale arrival of Nazi airborne troops in Syria, there are reports that several German troop transports are mixed in with the planes flying to Syria. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>New York: According to a German wireless message received here today, Damascus, the capital of Syria, has been repeatedly bombed by British planes. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>London: As revealed yesterday, Axis forces are prepared for battle; therefore, war in Syria could break out at any time. The London Express reports that an air division with 500 planes, tanks, and mechanized equipment is currently en route to Syria from Nantes. South African troops are currently traveling by truck along a 3,000-mile route to Egypt. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Negotiations Encounter Disputes</h3>
<p>Stockholm: While London and Berlin are concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude, neutral parties now believe that there must have been some disputes in the German-Soviet negotiations. A correspondent for the Social Democratic newspaper in Berlin commented on British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps's journey, saying that German newspapers are all asking how Cripps was summoned to London by Eden, because his journey from Sweden to England must pass through German-controlled areas. People here are completely silent on this issue. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives Bulgarian King, Hungarian Defense Minister Visits Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency announced yesterday that Führer Hitler received King Boris of Bulgaria, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also in attendance. The content of the conversation is unknown. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: Hungarian Defense Minister General Bartha left for Rome yesterday afternoon. (Haitong Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Former Iraqi Prime Minister Said to Be Sent to Turkey and Iran to Promote a Four-Nation Military Alliance, Baghdad's Order Has Not Yet Returned to Normal</h3>

<h3>Germany Plans to Gather a Large Army to Attack the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>Ankara: Turkish sources believe that the German army is preparing to gather a large army of one million men and heavy tanks to attack the Suez Canal from Libya.

<h3>Soviet Union Supplies Finland with Grain, While Criticizing Finland for Breaching Agreements</h3>
<p>Moscow: As of June 1 of this year, Finnish goods shipped to the Soviet Union totaled only $885,600, but during the same period, the Soviet Union shipped goods worth $3,559,200 to Finland. The Soviet-Finnish trade agreement stipulates that the trade volume should reach $7.5 million on each side within the first year. In other words, Soviet shipments to Finland accounted for 47.4% of the total, but Finnish shipments to the Soviet Union accounted for only 11.4% of the total. Finland's failure to fulfill the terms of the agreement has clearly hindered the further development of trade between the two countries. However, in view of the increasingly serious food shortage in Finland, Soviet People's Commissar Sverdlov, on May 30 of last month, agreed to Finnish Minister Paasikivi's request to ship 20,000 tons of grain to Finland in the near future (excluding the 15,578 tons previously shipped to Finland). In addition, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan informed the Finnish minister on the same day that he had ordered the Export Trade Department to expedite the shipment of 20,000 tons of grain to Finland. As of June 6, 7,514 tons had been shipped to Finland. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<h3>Fifth Anniversary of Gorky's Death</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Enigma of American-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>In the recent Far Eastern situation, the most noteworthy event, apart from the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations which have reached a critical juncture, is none other than the American-Japanese relationship. Following the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese pact and the Nazis' active eastward advance, the trend of deterioration in American-Japanese relations that the world had expected has only been occasionally seen in the statements of Japanese spokespersons and individual opinions. Recently, diplomatic contacts between the two sides have been frequent, and various rumors have spread endlessly. After repeated statements by the American authorities, yesterday's Associated Press report from Tokyo even suggested that the talks between American Ambassador to Japan Grew and Matsuoka might be a prelude to the initiation of improved relations between the United States and Japan. This suggests that the policy of appeasement is about to be revived in the Far East, which is a problem that urgently needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>Appeasement in the Far East once ran rampant, and even today, it has not disappeared from the ideals of some. What makes it particularly noteworthy is not the rumors themselves, but the current international situation, which is objectively creating an opportunity for the rise of appeasement in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact has not provided the Axis with assistance, but has only elevated Japan's pivotal position in the international arena. Regardless of whether the United States' three-ocean navy is not yet fully completed, even if it has the strength to be prepared for any eventuality, from a strategic point of view, fighting on two fronts is what any country tries to avoid. Therefore, as the United States gradually moves towards joining the war, how to prevent the application of the third clause of the Tripartite Pact by improving American-Japanese relations is always a very plausible reason. Thus, Roosevelt's fireside chat last week, which did not specifically mention the Pacific and the Far East, was seen as pleasing Japan, and Nomura's speech stating that Japan had not given up on improving relations with the United States soon followed. Recently, the frequent and active diplomatic contacts in Tokyo have shown that this attempt has moved from fantasy through probing to practical application.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan are not enemy countries or belligerents and have always maintained normal diplomatic relations. Therefore, there is no particularly surprising reason for the two sides to engage in diplomatic contacts. The problem lies in the true nature of the so-called improvement of relations, as well as whether it is possible and how to seek improvement. The United States is extremely concerned about the European situation, but the United States is also a Pacific nation and has significant interests in the Far East. Even if its views on the situation in the East and West differ in terms of urgency, it is difficult to imagine that it would apply completely different policies to deal with them separately. If it did so, how could it justify its consistent policy over the past decade and its policy of actively aiding China? Great vigilance must be exercised against the future offensive in the Atlantic by the Nazis, whose navy is almost non-existent, then it is clear that the naval threat from the world's third-ranked navy, which has always aimed to confront the United States, cannot be dealt with by appeasement. In the past ten days, the American authorities have twice stated that their policy towards Japan remains unchanged. In addition to rejecting the Japanese attempt to conclude a non-aggression pact, the exchange of letters between Hull and Kuo Tai-chi clearly demonstrated the United States' friendship and trust in China. Even if the rumors are not entirely without cause, they cannot weaken the effect of these official documents. Of course, the American authorities recently also stated that their policy remains unchanged, but the lack of a more active expression is probably the reason for the rumors and even the appeasement fantasies. Another statement by Hull on May 21 indicated that the United States had never taken the initiative in seeking an accommodation with the Japanese government, which clearly shows that it is not the American government that is eager to improve American-Japanese relations, but the other side. Combining the news from various sources in recent days, this movement is already actively underway. If the nature of its proposal is only to avoid the expansion of the Pacific war without changing the original order in the Far East, the American authorities will probably not reject it too severely, because what the United States is focusing on is only the stability and maintenance of order in the Far East, and the United States is not a warlike country. However, if it actually fantasizes about taking the opportunity to advance, wanting the American side to change its consistent policy, stop aiding China, and even recognize a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," then the so-called improvement of relations between the two countries can only be empty talk. Not only has the Soviet Union, which previously concluded a non-aggression treaty with Japan, rejected this type of condition, but even the Dutch-Indonesian side has so far refused to lose its position due to coercion in these negotiations, let alone the United States.</p>
<p>The current policy of the American side is undoubtedly sound, but its view that the European situation is more important than the Far East is an exploitable gap. In fact, no matter how much the aggressor shows off, the anti-aggression war is ultimately a whole and cannot be divided. The order and security of the Pacific do not depend on the good intentions of the aggressor, but entirely on whether the democratic countries have sufficient preparedness and strength to respond to changes. What can truly yield effective results in this regard is a powerful fleet, measures to aid China, and not diplomatic negotiations that may cause doubts about appeasement.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Taihang Mountains, Contacts Occur in the Damo Mountains and Tongshan, Chinese Launch Guerrilla Warfare Around Qingdao</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Fierce fighting continues in the Taihang Mountains in southeastern Shanxi Province. The Chinese 98th and 27th Army units are currently fighting the Japanese army in the mountains north of the Yuanqu-Jiyuan highway and along both sides of the Tunliu-Gaoping highway. Chinese and Japanese artillery units are exchanging fire across the Yellow River every day. The Japanese army is currently attacking the Qiwu Mountains (phonetic) in southwestern Shanxi Province, south of the Fen River. A part of the Chinese army in the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi moved into the mountains three weeks ago after the Japanese army entered southern Shanxi. There is fighting in the Damo Mountains (phonetic) in southeastern Xianning, southern Hubei, and Tongshan (phonetic) in the northeast. The Chinese mobile units in the area use Tongshan as a base to control transportation in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. The Japanese army launched an attack on the mountains on May 25 in an effort to clear out the Chinese forces in the mountains. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Southern Shandong: The Chinese army recently launched a large-scale guerrilla war around Qingdao, achieving great success. The Boyu Prison and the so-called Shandong Salt Bureau in Qingdao were destroyed by the Chinese army last month. The garrison stationed on the island also took the opportunity to defect en masse. The Japanese naval and army forces in Qingdao gathered more than 1,000 men and launched repeated fierce attacks on the Chinese army, but were defeated. In recent days, the Japanese army has again gathered more than 3,000 men from Pingdu, Zhucheng, Gaomi, and Jiaoxian, with a detachment of marines, and launched fierce attacks on the northwest of Jimo and the southwest of Jiaoxian in several directions. The Chinese army fought back and forth fiercely more than ten times and was finally defeated. The Chinese army pursued and destroyed the Qingdao Baisha River Water Plant, capturing Japanese instructor Ichiyama Ichiro and others. In total, more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed, more than 300 rifles, 5 machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, 2 mountain guns, and a large amount of ammunition were seized, and Japanese commander Shirin and more than 10 Japanese soldiers were captured.

<h3>Japanese Disregard Vietnamese Governor's Protest, Illegally Transporting Goods from the United States in Vietnam; Five Large Ships, Estimated at Over 10,000 Tons, Have Been Transported; US Consul in Hanoi Has Reported the Details to the US Government</h3>
<p>Hanoi: Japanese military officials today continued to load goods seized from warehouses in Haiphong on May 15th, ignoring repeated protests from the Vietnamese government since the Japanese military detained the goods. The French side has acknowledged that they are under pressure from the Japanese and unable to interfere. It is recalled that when the Japanese suddenly began confiscating the goods, Japanese military machine guns were deployed throughout the streets near the warehouses, and Japanese aircraft circled over Haiphong. The goods already transported by the Japanese include raw materials, metal sheets, freight cars, rubber tires, and machinery, totaling over 10,000 tons, divided into five large ships, and transported to Hainan Island. It is worth noting that the Japanese have consistently ignored suggestions from the original owners of all detained goods, asking the Vietnamese government to resolve the issue of the goods on their behalf. On May 25th, without stating the reason, the Japanese suddenly notified the original owners to hand over the keys to the warehouses. After the original owners handed over the keys to the French officials in Haiphong, the Japanese immediately began seizing the goods. It is reported that the US Consul in Hanoi, considering that the goods include those belonging to two American companies, Far East Trading Company and North American Company, has reported all the details to the US government. Since occupying Vietnam last year, the Japanese have insisted that the goods are military supplies destined for China and not the property of Americans. (8th United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Hanoi: A certain Japanese news agency issued a message claiming that the French authorities in Haiphong Port had permitted the Japanese to detain a large quantity of military equipment and other goods stored there by the Chinese government.

<h3>US Government to Resolve Labor Disputes: Army to Take Over Factories; Order Can Be Signed by President at Any Time; Final Advice to Workers Today</h3>
<p>Washington: The nation and members of Congress are quite indignant about the frequent labor strikes in important industries. It is generally believed that while each soldier receives only four yuan per week, workers earn eight yuan per day and still strike for more, which is considered greedy and insatiable. It is heard that the heads of the army and navy are dissatisfied with the labor strikes. Although they do not wish to interfere with labor rights, they also do not want to see the production of war equipment, on which national security depends, being halted by labor strikes. President Roosevelt's delay in quelling the labor strikes is puzzling to many, with some believing that the president is letting labor commit evil and destroy itself. The Army Department has now initiated the drafting of an industry bill, the true purpose of which is to deal with labor. It is rumored that aircraft production in May was only slightly higher than in April due to labor strikes. Even if the labor strikes are resolved, production in June may not exceed that of May. If so, the plan to increase production to 20,000 aircraft this year will not be realized. Strikes in the shipbuilding industry are as harmful as those in the aircraft manufacturing industry. Presidential Secretary O'Reilly told people that the president hopes for a peaceful resolution of the labor strikes; otherwise, he will have to take over the industries. The president has invited the leader of the International Association of Machinists, Mr. Brown, to come to Washington to discuss the machinists' strike at the San Francisco shipyard. When asked about the Pacific Coast timber industry strike, O'Reilly replied that it was not a cause for concern because the timber supply was abundant. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's Secretary O'Reilly said yesterday that the necessary documents have been prepared and can be signed at any time to allow the Army to take over and operate the North American Aviation factory during worker strikes. The president is traveling this weekend and is expected to return on Monday. If the strikers have not returned to work by then, the president will sign this document. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: The United States currently has three major labor strikes that are sufficient to hinder the progress of national defense programs: one is the machinists' strike at the Bethelem shipyard on the West Coast, the second is the strike at the North American Aviation factory in Inglewood, California, and the third is the strike of forestry workers in Washington State. The US Production Management Bureau has issued a notice to the striking workers, advising them to return to work. It is reported that President Roosevelt is also scheduled to make a final appeal to the striking workers on Monday. If they continue to strike, the government will take strict measures to end the strikes. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: The strike at North American Aviation in Inglewood, California, has lasted for three days, halting the production of $1,910,000,000 worth of British and American aircraft. The White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has decided to confiscate and take over the company's factory if the workers do not return to work on Sunday. He is currently examining the legal issues of this action with officials. The document for taking over the factory has already been drafted. President's Secretary O'Reilly said that the president will postpone action until the United Auto Workers union meets on Sunday and will study the situation on Sunday night. On Monday morning, he will sign the document ordering the Army to take over and manage the factory. The President's approach should not be regarded as a threat to the workers. The President insists that national defense projects cannot be stopped again due to strikes. The President is giving the workers an opportunity to decide for themselves. If the Army takes over the factory, all workers will have the right to return to work. This statement indicates that the Army will guard the factory and repel the workers' pickets so that non-striking workers can enter and work. (8th United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: According to sources close to the White House, President Roosevelt has decided to take firm measures to crack down on the strike at the North American Aviation factory in Inglewood, California.

<h3>Japan Still Yearns to Improve Relations with the US; It Is Widely Believed That the US Ambassador's Visit to Matsuoka May Have Revealed This Intention</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Political observers expressed their opinion today that US Ambassador to Tokyo Joseph Grew's recent visit to Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka may be a prelude to the initiation of negotiations between the US and Japan to improve relations. People are paying such attention to the conversation between the two because they met immediately following Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura's declaration. According to Nomura, Japan has not abandoned hope of improving relations despite difficulties. It is also worth noting that this matter occurred after Secretary of State Hull's response last Wednesday regarding the continued shipment of large quantities of raw materials from the United States to Japan and the Soviet Union. This answer by Hull to inquiries was considered by many quarters in the United States and Japan as a defense by Washington of its recent policy of not imposing a complete economic blockade on Japan so as not to provoke Japan. "The Japan Times and Advertiser" recently published a commentary discussing the situation in the Pacific, revealing Japan's desire to improve US-Japan relations. The newspaper said that Ambassador Nomura stated in his speech that although he has collected various information since arriving in the United States, his confidence in a peaceful resolution of disputes in the Pacific has not diminished. He believes that "if both sides can show goodwill, especially if the United States does not take actions that would force Japan to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact, then the goal of friendship between the two countries can be achieved." The newspaper said that the American people, having obtained the frank and hopeful verbal guarantee of General Nomura, will be able to obtain powerful tools to promote cooperation between the government and the Japanese government. "Kokumin Shimbun," a nationalist extremist newspaper that often reflects the views of the military, said that if the United States truly wants to improve US-Japan relations, Washington should abandon its anti-Japanese actions, including aid to Chongqing. "Kokumin Shimbun" argued that the Tripartite Pact is not aimed at the United States, but only to prevent the United States from entering the European war. (8th United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Japan May Not Dare to Break with the US</p>
<p>Washington: Sims, foreign affairs editor of the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance, wrote in the newspaper yesterday, claiming that the delay between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in avoiding a rupture is considered by Washington as an indication that Japan, at least for the present, does not want to create a crisis with the United States. Sims's article stated, "After months of negotiations, the Japanese side declared that if the Dutch East Indies could not provide a satisfactory answer by noon on Friday, the consequences would be serious. Although the current outcome is not yet known, the deadline has passed, and there has been no eruption. The seriousness of this dispute has not diminished, and Japanese warlords have not indicated that they have abandoned their ambition to invade the island. This invasion will trigger a new war in the Pacific, and the United States may also join it. Many people in Japan and the United States feel that a US-Japan war is unavoidable, but a large and influential group of Americans and Japanese believe that a US-Japan war can be avoided and will be avoided no matter how difficult. Among those who hold this view are President Roosevelt, Yosuke Matsuoka, and Kichisaburo Nomura. Although reports that the US and Japan had negotiated a non-aggression pact have been denied, it can be stated with certainty that Hull and Nomura have explored ways to improve mutual understanding. Some people in Japan believe that Nomura's main mission in the US is to delay the inevitable moment. Other Japanese believe that a war will cause both Japan and the US to suffer, while the Communists will benefit. Therefore, leaders in Tokyo sent Nomura to the US to find a way to avoid war, but this is difficult to find because the United States has a strong policy on the war in China. The United States has no intention of abandoning China and cannot accept Japan's dominance of India, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. Therefore, the crisis between Japan and the Dutch East Indies will involve the United States." (8th United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Still Willing to Reach Compromise with Dutch East Indies; Negotiations Between Both Parties Will Not Result in Rupture</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Responsible sources here say that although newspapers are pessimistic about the negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, the government is determined to reach a compromise with the Dutch East Indies government. However, whether Japan's "greatest and final effort" has any hope of success will be clear within a few days. At present, there will be no immediate rupture between the two parties. Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese representative in the Dutch East Indies, yesterday reported to the government on the latest negotiations, including the Dutch East Indies' response to various Japanese proposals. Foreign Minister Matsuoka is scheduled to convene a meeting of foreign ministry officials and experts today to study them in order to issue new instructions to Yoshizawa, requesting the Dutch East Indies authorities to revise certain points in the answer and to clarify certain sections whose meaning is ambiguous and conflicting with the Japanese proposal.

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government is currently studying the Dutch East Indies government's response to the Japanese proposals. According to well-informed sources, the government is currently discussing the stubborn attitude of the Dutch East Indies with various responsible parties. Local newspapers are severely criticizing the attitude of the Dutch East Indies, hoping that the authorities will break with it. All newspapers believe that even if negotiations continue, they will not be able to change the situation. (8th Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: It was learned yesterday that several defense officials told Congress that the United States must maintain the supply line to the Dutch East Indies "at all costs." Congress learned in a closed-door meeting that certain raw materials are currently in short supply, especially rubber, so some non-defense rubber tires have to be used.

<p>Tokyo: Five prominent Japanese newspapers today attacked the authorities in the Dutch East Indies, saying that the failure of the final conditions proposed by the Japanese side in the recent business negotiations held in Batavia to receive a satisfactory response was due to the unfriendly attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper called on the government to suspend negotiations, saying that the Dutch East Indies' tough attitude was due to its reliance on Britain and the United States. Regarding this point, it is known that the joint defense plan between Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands has been practically completed. The newspaper pointed out that the Dutch have strengthened their defenses, especially because they have received assistance from the United States. The Asahi Shimbun said that the Japanese government should prepare a far-reaching new policy to deal with the Dutch East Indies. The other newspapers that made similar comments were the Nichinichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Hochi Shimbun, and Miyako Shimbun. (6th United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>Hoover Emphasizes Air Power; Urges American Scientific Community to Study Carefully</h3>
<p>Haverford: Former Republican President Herbert Hoover declared last night while speaking to the graduating class of Haverford College that science should produce a response to military aircraft, adding, "If such a response can be realized and realized soon, it can transform the entire destiny of the world." Hoover expressed regret that the funds used for scientific research in the United States were so small. He said, "We will spend 20 billion US dollars annually for military equipment. If we can use one percent of this amount for research, we can recover some of the losses after the war." Hoover also said, "Aircraft have reformed war and made aggressors more powerful, while making smaller countries unable to defend their freedom, and the massacre of women and children has become part of the war. The world has not yet invented a method of defense. Aircraft are produced by physical science, so the method of defense may also come from it. Therefore, we must study it."

<h3>Shipping Between US and South America Currently Feels Shortage of Vessels; Reason Is Due to Navy Department Requisitioning Ships, Resulting in Delays in Transshipment of Various Raw Materials</h3>
<p>New York: The US Navy Department's requisitioning of US ships has led to a shortage of vessels in shipping between the United States and South America. The use of ships from Axis countries should ease this situation somewhat. South American warehouses are currently full of goods waiting to be shipped to the United States. According to the New York Journal of Commerce, the transshipment of important raw materials from South America and the Far East, such as tin, antimony, tungsten, manganese, rubber, and copper, is delayed due to a lack of ships. It is expected that the authorities will use some of the seized foreign ships to transport these necessary items. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>European War Chat (62)</p>
<p>The Severity of the Atlantic War</p>
<p>U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt recently delivered a historic "fireside chat," stating that German submarines and aircraft were sinking merchant ships at a rate three times higher than Britain's replacement rate and twice as high as the combined shipbuilding rate of Britain and the United States. This shows the severity of the Atlantic war.</p>
<p>In the past twelve months, Britain lost a total of 4,158,986 tons of ships, including cargo worth a total of US$145,564,510 and ships valued at approximately US$1,500,000,000. From the beginning of the war to the end of April this year, Britain and its allies lost more than 1,000 ships, totaling 5,651,481 tons, with cargo and ships valued at US$1,893,246,135. At the start of the war, Britain had over 12,000,000 tons of seagoing ships exceeding 1,000 tons, which has now been reduced to 7,000,000 tons. However, according to estimates by "The Economist" magazine in London, Britain has acquired 8,000,000 tons of ships from Norway and other countries. As a result, Britain currently has 15,000,000 tons of ships. (German ships sunk totaled 1,800,000 tons, and Italian ships sunk totaled 1,200,000 tons, totaling 3,000,000 tons).</p>
<p>At the outset of this European war, Britain possessed 21,000,000 tons of various merchant ships "Note 1". It subsequently obtained 9,000,000 tons from allied and neutral countries, plus 3,000,000 tons from manufacturing, purchasing, leasing, and seizures, bringing the total to 33,000,000 tons. Based on common sense, after deducting the 530 tons lost, Britain should still have 27,700,000 tons remaining.</p>
<p>However, this number is inflated and unrealistic. A large portion has been requisitioned by the Admiralty for transporting troops and supplies to the Mediterranean and for use as escort patrols. Many merchant ships are also unsuitable for transport work, such as river vessels, ferries in the English Channel, and passenger ships with small cargo holds. In addition, many ships are assigned to special uses and cannot travel long distances. Therefore, the actual tonnage of ships used to transport military supplies and food to Britain is only 13,000,000 tons.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sailing speed has been reduced compared to the past. During escort missions, all ships can only use the speed of the slowest ship as the standard, and they must take winding routes, which take twice as long as usual. The transport capacity of these 13,000,000 tons of merchant ships is therefore only equivalent to 6,500,000 tons in normal times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, among all British ports, only Liverpool, Clyde, and Severn are able to be fully utilized. Edinburgh, Newcastle, Hull, London, and Southampton have gradually lost their original positions under concentrated attacks by German submarines and aircraft, further reducing the effective use of approximately 5,000,000 tons of merchant ships.</p>
<p>The reality is even worse. Shipyards are often filled with 1,000,000 tons of ships with heavy or light damage waiting for repairs. One-quarter of this damage is due to normal navigation, while the rest is the result of German destruction. Thus, shipyards are facing a situation where they urgently need to build new ships and warships while constantly repairing existing ships, creating a severe shortage of resources.</p>
<p>Due to these various reasons, although Britain nominally has 17,700,000 tons of merchant ships, only 4,000,000 tons are actually available for transporting overseas supplies during wartime. Since March this year, British merchant ship losses have averaged 100,000 tons per week "Note 2". At this rate, annual losses will reach 5,000,000 tons or more. Assuming the highest shipbuilding rate for Britain and the United States this year is 1,100,000 tons, Britain will suffer a net loss of 2,000,000 tons, equivalent to 22% of the current transport fleet (13,000,000 tons). The actual tonnage will also decrease to just over 3,000,000 tons. If this continues, it is difficult to see how it will end.</p>
<p>During the last European war, Britain was quite successful in dealing with submarines. After British merchant ship losses broke all records in April 1917 (totaling 394,700 tons), the establishment of a military convoy system proved highly effective. From 1917 to 1918, Atlantic convoys safely reached their destinations at a rate of 99.08%. British destroyers were highly skilled in searching for and sinking enemy submarines. By the end of the war, destroyers had a 30% success rate in hitting targets with depth charges, but since the start of this European war, due to different circumstances, the results have not been as impressive.</p>
<p>First, the ratio of German offensive power to British defensive power is vastly different now compared to then. At the end of the last European war, Britain still had 496 destroyers and could obtain 100 from the United States, 92 from France, and 67 from Italy, totaling 755 ships. The situation is different in this war. As of late April this year, Britain had just over 200 destroyers, including 50 transferred from the United States and several dozen old-fashioned medium-sized cruisers. In the spring of 1917, Germany's submarine strength was only 128, but this spring, it is at least 180, or possibly even more. Thus, Germany's offensive power has increased by more than half compared to before, while Britain's defensive power is less than half of what it used to be.</p>
<p>As for Britain using battleships for escort, although it provides some assistance, it is ultimately a losing proposition. During the last European war, the German fleet was a formidable force, and British battleships had to concentrate in Singapore Bay to prevent German ships from encircling and attacking. In this war, with Germany's limited number of battleships and Italy's fleet proving to be weak "Note 3," Britain has been able to disperse its fleet for escort duties. However, battleships are not as fast as destroyers and cannot pursue submarines; they can only deter enemy raiding ships.</p>
<p>From 1917 to 1918, Britain only needed to guard the Dover Strait and the area between Scotland and Norway in the North Sea to prevent German submarines from entering. The entire blockade line was only 300 nautical miles long. By the end of the war, the entire line was heavily mined. This time, Germany has occupied Norway and most of the French coast, with a coastline stretching 2,300 nautical miles from Narvik, Norway, to Bayonne, France. Germany can freely choose its attack bases, making it difficult for Britain to defend against.</p>

<p>Economic Special Edition</p>
<p>Things Seen, Heard, and Thought</p>
<p>June is typically a slow month for Shanghai. Even during extraordinary times, it inevitably suffers from regular seasonal effects. In the ebb and flow of speculation, it appears all the more desolate.</p>
<p>Everyone probably remembers: after the May 2nd storm last year, there was a June panic. At that time, the price of gold plummeted by 1,000 yuan in ten days (from 6,494 yuan on the 3rd to 5,200 yuan on the 11th). Each package of twenty Double Horse cigarettes dropped by more than 600 yuan (from 1,45 yuan on the 4th to 805 yuan on the 14th). Foreign stocks also plunged by 50-60 yuan to 200-300 yuan each.</p>
<p>History does not repeat itself, but seasons are cyclical. Look: this kind of seasonal panic phenomenon began at the end of May. Both gold and yarn prices are gradually declining. Perhaps because the lingering fear of last year remains, most speculators have to take precautions in advance?</p>
<p>I heard that the recent sharp drop in yarn prices, in addition to seasonal influences, has a special reason. That is, a certain exchange is opening its doors to welcome guests with gifts. It is using price reductions to attract customers. This is the same as encouraging military ticket speculation, deliberately creating a trend to attract speculators' attention to help the issue of tickets. Moreover, customer groups often choose the cheaper options when importing yarn; lowering prices also appeals to popular sentiment. This method could not be more ingenious.</p>
<p>However, price reductions and dumping cause losses for oneself. But implementing dumping on the exchange market is a bit like being generous at the expense of others. But in all fairness, current yarn prices are still too high, not enough to be called "discounted." The so-called "discount" here refers only to another Double Horse market.</p>
<p>Since the soaring grain prices, labor disputes have spread to all industries. The only exception is the rice industry. They have consistently cooperated with each other, which is truly commendable. But this time, at the beginning of the Municipal Council's cheap rice entering the market and bringing rice prices back to normal, an unprecedented "non-cooperation" trend suddenly occurred among rice merchants. Fortunately, the Municipal Council handled it properly, and work soon resumed. But what their intentions are cannot help but make people suspicious. I recently heard that the Municipal Council is mediating the situation, and I think the Municipal Council will not fall for their tricks.</p>
<p>County and Township Financial Restructuring</p>
<p>Li Yibing</p>
<p>New-style financial institutions in our country are not only geographically concentrated in the coastal provinces' major cities, but their business activities also primarily target urban commercial and industrial enterprises. Moreover, due to other unbalanced developments in the national economy, the phenomenon of surplus capital being concentrated has intensified. Cities are constantly congested with large amounts of floating capital that cannot be absorbed, while the vast counties and townships suffer from severe anemia.</p>
<p>Although, a few years before the war, the banking industry in Shanghai enthusiastically promoted the slogan of capital returning to the countryside, making efforts to expand the establishment of branch offices and actively promoting the handling of agricultural loans, the results were minimal. On the surface, the number of bank branch offices has indeed increased, but the areas of distribution are still limited to small cities with thriving commerce. And although the main business is centered on agricultural loans, the short time frame, small amounts, and not-very-correct lending targets have not fulfilled the real task of regulating civilian finance. It has even led to local commercial capital colluding to become blood-sucking vessels of county and township finance, absorbing the financial power of the counties and townships and gathering it like myriad streams returning to the sea in the big cities to "float." This so-called "local economic balance and safekeeping authority" is clearly not something that ordinary banks can reliably achieve.</p>
<p>Originally, ordinary private banks are profit-making enterprises, so naturally their business expansion must be based on the premise of enterprise profits. The nature of capital is originally like water: water flows downwards, and capital always flows to places with higher interest rates. The targets of county and township finance are mainly agricultural credit with lower profit growth rates and longer terms. Even the industrial and commercial credit transactions of local small industries and local transportation organizations are generally limited by the production environment, and their profits can never be equated with speculative transactions in big cities. The lending purchase limits cannot be as agile and active as short-term commercial credit in cities. Therefore, the concentration of new-style banks in cities is a natural result. Because private financial businesses cannot abandon their profit-making principles and cannot ignore the limitations of time and place in their own capital movements, they naturally cannot provide sufficient county and township loans at low interest rates and for longer periods.</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, county and township finance mainly involves many small-amount deposits and withdrawals, making the manual procedures cumbersome and complicated. Moreover, based on past experience in handling agricultural loans, the general population in counties and townships is not good at using new-style financial institutions, and the new-style financial institutions have not improved the cumbersome procedures. Therefore, most people's financing needs are still held in the hands of private high-interest lenders and pawnshops. According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute before the war, the sources of farmers' loans were mainly individuals, shops, and pawnshops, accounting for more than 89%. The financing of general shops is mostly within the domain of money shops. As for the newly established credit cooperatives, not only are there few in number and their geographical distribution is narrow, but undeniably many of them are in the hands of local tyrants and evil gentry, becoming new tools for exploitation. The actual production teams in counties and townships still have to live under the exploitation of high interest rates of 3-5% or more.</p>
<p>The situation before the war was like this, so what is the actual situation of county and township finance after the war? Since the war first broke out in the coastal areas, financial institutions temporarily retreated to the rear, and voices for internal migration of capital and development of the southwest rose loudly. However, according to the actual performance over the past four years, apart from government banks, not many private banks have established branch offices in the interior. Those that have truly completely retreated to the rear are certainly as rare as stars at dawn. Even among the few banks that have migrated internally from Shanghai, the general direction of their business is still mostly hesitant and wait-and-see, only putting up a facade as decoration. As for the issue of internal migration of capital, just look at the exchange rate between the major rear areas in the interior and Shanghai, which has consistently shown a reverse trend since the war, with the exchange rate getting higher day by day, and the fact that the deposit amounts in Shanghai's banking industry continue to increase and floating capital is rampant, churning with unprecedented speculative tides. This can serve as an excellent illustration.</p>
<p>However, in the few years after the war, the government did make efforts to adjust agriculture and local finance, planning various new facilities and programs. It promised that the construction of the agricultural financial system, the promotion of credit cooperatives, the expansion of agricultural loans, and the improvement of local finance would have very progressive performance and achieve a considerable foundation. This is the only exciting fact when discussing the current state of county and township finance.</p>
<p>The above is a brief review of the position of county and township finance in the entire financial industry, and it can be seen how deeply the power of finance has been biased in the past. Conversely, it is not difficult to imagine the pathological state of China's financial industry's abnormal development in the coastal areas and cities. This is neither the way to build a sound national finance nor is it beneficial to wartime national policies.</p>
<p>The foundation of a nation's wealth lies in materials. If the production of materials can be expanded, and the rate of re-production turnover can be increased, the accumulation of national wealth will naturally also increase. This is true in peacetime, but in wartime, due to the fierce destruction of war and the large increase in military consumption, the need for material replenishment is all the more urgent. However, to actively promote production and expand the production field, one cannot be separated from the foundation of material storage - the vast county and township areas. The three conditions of production are land, labor, and capital. With the vast land, abundant labor, fertile land, and abundant reserves in China's county and township areas, there are extremely excellent natural endowments, but they cannot be without the element of capital. Therefore, the construction of county and township finance can be said to be a prerequisite for national production and economic construction, and its importance is easy to imagine.</p>
<p>Secondly, we talk about the issue of the main body responsible for undertaking the task of establishing county and township finance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, private banks are limited by the desire for their own enterprise profits and hindered by the normal rules of their own capital movements, so they naturally cannot fully take on the entirety of this task. Taking agricultural credit as an example, in European and American countries, either the government participates in capital and provides financial assistance, or they mostly have a unified central organization that is directly protected, assisted, and supervised by the government. Therefore, the main body for the construction of county and township finance should be publicly owned, especially in our country where the foundation is weak.</p>
<p>However, given the vastness of China's county and township areas, it is certainly impossible for the government's capital alone to universally establish a financial network in the counties and townships. Therefore, from the perspective of promoting county and township financial institutions and their sources of funding, we feel that the existing local financial organizations and the inherent wealth of the local area are indeed a major cornerstone of creation.</p>
<p>From an overall perspective, county and township finance is indeed greatly deficient. However, firstly, the government's efforts to promote agricultural finance and the initial scale of credit cooperation in recent years are all helpful for the creation. Secondly, the existence of local banks and native silver firms in various provinces, these original local financial organizations, are all important foundations for promoting county and township financial institutions. However, because they lacked a strict system in the past and did not have a strong and powerful central organization, some were limited by their own weak capital and could not independently develop their business, while others were poorly managed and human schemes were reduced, leading to the organization being scattered. In addition, the lack of profit guarantees for capital investment often caused them to hesitate and even distort the mission they should have undertaken. Therefore, if we examine it from the two aspects of organization and capital, we believe that the original local financial institutions can be utilized, but they must be thoroughly reorganized, especially in merging organizations, so as to concentrate capital, unify steps, and add the assistance of the central organization to promote business and protect business interests. Strict supervision of business is more effective than building a new stove on top of a bed.</p>
<p>As for the source of funds, the local financial organizations themselves have considerable capital, which can be used for local production undertakings in a unified step. Even if there are poor counties and townships, the central organization can invest appropriately. Moreover, due to the expansion of business, the absorption of deposits, the encouragement of savings, and the transformation of dead capital in the counties and townships, all can be regarded as the main sources. To put it a little further, the development of county and township production undertakings is enough to increase the savings power of the general public, and due to the high prices of agricultural products after the war, the current savings power of rural areas is far from comparable to that before the war. This is another excellent opportunity to create county and township finance at present.</p>
<p>To truly achieve the development of local industries with local capital, we can truly realize the "local economic balance and safekeeping authority" to curb the pathological development of capital concentration in cities. To achieve balanced development of capital in all counties and townships, the bias of finance and institutions can be naturally corrected. This is not only of great significance to the promotion of production and balanced prices during wartime, but also an important foundation for the future of national construction.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance created County and Township Banks, which is a great plan mainly aimed at utilizing local capital to develop local wealth and assist the original financial institutions in the counties and townships. The head office has been established in Chongqing, with a total capital of 20 million national currency.</p>
<p>The significance of the establishment of the bank and its importance in wartime and construction have been described in detail above. Now, let's briefly review the three aspects of the bank's organization, business, and management.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, County and Township Banks do not adopt the general branch office system, but rather a bank with the nature of a parent company. It only participates in part of the capital of the County and Township Banks in each province and sets up offices in each province to engage in guidance.</p>
<p>In principle, the local County and Township Banks are reorganized from the original financial organizations in various places, so they cannot lose their organizational independence and adopt a branch office system. However, the single bank system has great loopholes in management due to the lack of subordination and connection. Therefore, the County and Township Bank adopts the system of a parent company with an enterprise organizational form in its organization, which is originally a compromise method. However, in view of the past scattered and weak local finance and the fact that business operations have not been on track, we believe that at least two points should be paid attention to in the current organization: First, the power and determination of government control should be used to merge the local financial institutions into a unified organizational structure to enhance the use of capital and talents, and to overcome the ills of scattered power and loose organization. Second, in the application of the organizational system, guidance is not enough, but effective and direct management should be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of enterprise management, so that business management has a strong subordination relationship, which is conducive to the correctness, agility, and effectiveness of business promotion.

<p>Silk Cocoon News and Knowledge</p>
<p>—Teaching Material for "Commercial News" from the School of Commerce, Shanghai University—</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai's silk merchants would suddenly get busy around this time. Now, they can only watch the Japanese get busy. This is the biggest wartime feature of China's silk industry, but other than that, general matters related to the silk industry are no different.</p>
<p>Our country is the homeland of the world's silk industry, but now it has been overtaken by Japan, Italy, France, and other latecomers. However, our country has a vast production area and cheap labor, so as long as we catch up quickly, it is not difficult to recover lost ground.</p>
<p>Cocoon</p>
<p>Silkworm species are generally divided into Chinese species, Japanese species, and Italian species. Chinese silkworm cocoons are oval and large, while Japanese species are thin in the middle and oval at both ends. In terms of color, they are divided into white and yellow. Yellow cocoons are easy to feed, but the output is poor, while white cocoons are the mainstay of the silk industry. In addition, there are so-called "double cocoons," that is, two silkworms combine to form one cocoon. The silk threads of double cocoons are disordered and must be reeled with special machines.</p>
<p>The grade of the cocoon is determined by color, shape, silk quantity, unwinding, dryness, and impurities. The amount of silk is the most important. The average weight of each cocoon is from 1.8 to 2.4 millimeters, the amount of silk layer accounts for 19%, and the amount of silk accounts for 14%. However, due to the different types of silkworms, the silk yield is not consistent. For high-quality Chinese silkworm cocoons, one dan of raw cocoons can yield one dan of silk. European species can produce one jin of silk per twelve jin, while Japanese species can produce one jin of silk per sixteen jin.</p>
<p>Silkworm Species</p>
<p>Before the war, the Chinese government had already paid attention to the improvement of cocoon species and had designated the following excellent original silkworm species:</p>
<p>Univoltine species include Hang Gui, Qia Gui, Xi Qia, Xi Qiao, Xi Hao, Dong Geng, Hua Gui No. 1, Hua Gui No. 2, etc.</p>
<p>Bivoltine species include Hua Wu, Hua Liu, Hua Qi, Ying Zhen, etc.</p>
<p>The so-called univoltine means spring silkworms with one generation per year, while bivoltine means summer and autumn silkworms with two generations (i.e., two harvests) per year. According to eugenics, crossbreeding is often used to improve silkworm species. According to test results, the following hybrid species have the best performance: Hang Gui and Hua Wu, Hang Gui and Hua Liu, Hua Liu and Xi Qiao, Hua Wu and Xi Qia, Xi Hao and Qia Gui, Dong Geng and Qia Gui, Qia Gui and Hua Liu, Ying Zhen and Hua Qi, Hua Gui No. 1 and Hua Liu.</p>
<p>Cocoon Market</p>
<p>Fresh cocoons are listed in two periods: spring and autumn. Spring cocoons are the most important, followed by autumn cocoons. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, spring cocoons are listed from mid-May to early June, lasting only about two weeks. Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Huzhou in Zhejiang and Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yixing, Dongting Mountain, Jiangyin, Liyang, etc. in Jiangsu are all important markets. Shanghai silk factories send personnel to set up offices to collect cocoons, and there are cocoon firms locally that collect cocoons to sell to silk factories.</p>
<p>Cocoon Price</p>
<p>The quality of the cocoons is the deciding factor in the price of cocoons. Cocoons with broken shells and dirty cocoons are calculated as waste cocoon prices and cannot be compared with the prices of clean and complete cocoons.</p>
<p>The second factor that constitutes the cocoon price is the silk price. In theory, the silk price is the sum of the cocoon price and the silk reeling labor price. Therefore, subtracting the labor price from the silk price is the price of the raw cocoons. So, the general formula for evaluating cocoon prices is:</p>
<p>The formula commonly used for assessing cocoon prices in Japan is called "Kake," which calculates that the cocoon price should account for 16% of the price per 16 kwan (each kwan weighs 6.25 Japanese kin, totaling 100 Japanese kin), so the formula is:</p>
<p>Since the cocoon price is based on the silk price, the cocoon price must be low when the silk price is low. This connection often causes losses for silkworm farmers. Because silkworm farmers have to pay not only wages but also mulberry leaf prices. If mulberry leaves are expensive and cocoons are cheap, there is a risk of loss. The reason why China's silk industry has declined in recent years is that Japanese silk dumping has led to a sharp drop in world silk prices, resulting in a drop in cocoon prices, making silkworm farmers unprofitable, so they have given up this industry. Therefore, calculating cocoon prices based on silk prices is not a good way to encourage silkworm farming.</p>
<p>Packaging and Unit</p>
<p>Cocoon packaging varies depending on the distance of transportation. Usually, burlap bags are used and placed in bamboo baskets. Rotten cocoons are placed in burlap bags and strapped with iron bars. The pupae must be killed before packaging. Each package weighs approximately 100 jin, and the asking price is also calculated by the dan. Retail transactions are calculated by the jin.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Names</p>
<p>(1) White Local Silk, (2) Yellow Local Silk, both reeled by local methods. (3) White Silk Warp, also known as Huache Qianjing, also known as Pingche Dajing: Zhejiang Huzhou's Jili white silk warp belongs to this category. This is the goods reeled from local silk. (4) Yellow Silk Warp, which is goods reeled from yellow local silk. (5) White Mill Warp, (6) Yellow Mill Warp, both machine-reeled. (7) Gray Silk Warp, that is, wild silkworm silk, also known as tussah silk. There are eight-cocoon gray warp, large-frame gray warp, and small-frame gray warp. This refers to the number of cocoons combined to reel each silk warp. For example, eight-cocoon gray warp means that one silk warp is composed of eight cocoons. (8) Dou Gong Silk, that is, silk reeled from double cocoons or so-called double cocoons.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Grades</p>
<p>Chinese silk grades are roughly divided into high grade, superior grade, medium grade, and inferior grade. Japanese silk is divided into special grade AAA, AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, etc. The New York silk market is divided into GXXS, GXX, XXS, Cr.XX, XX, Best, and Extra seven grades. The grades are determined by fineness, uniformity, clarity, strength, elongation, and cohesion. The special unit is indicated by denier per strip. For each silk strip, roughly 5 strips of denier are combined to form 14 denier, and 7 strips of 3 denier are combined to form 11 denier. The so-called denier is a unit that is 450 meters long (the international unit is 900 meters) and weighs 0.05 millimeters. For example, 2 denier is 450 meters long and weighs 1 millimeter (i.e., 20 times 0.05 millimeters). Since the grade is based on weight as a unit, the fineness per strip is closely related to the grade. Usually, 30/32 strips are the largest, and 9/11 strips are the smallest. Uniformity grade A is above 85 points, and grade B is above 80 points.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Packaging</p>
<p>Chinese silk packaging, for domestic sales, is roughly one dan per piece; for export sales, there are large warp and mouth warp. Large warp weighs 160 pounds per package, divided into 20 bundles; each bundle weighs 8 pounds, divided into 15 skeins. Mouth warp weighs 135 pounds per package, divided into 15 bundles, each bundle divided into 40 to 50 skeins. Japanese silk packaging has two types: marukan and sixteen kwan. The former weighs 58 Japanese kin, and the latter weighs 100 Japanese kin (i.e., 132.275 pounds). The transaction price deducts the tare weight and checks the net weight for calculation. The so-called net weight is to check whether there is water and obtain the dry net weight.</p>
<p>Asking Price Unit</p>
<p>Chinese silk is calculated per dan; Japanese silk spot is per 100 Japanese kin in Japanese yen; spot is per 100 Japanese kin in Japanese yen, New York per pound in US dollars; Lyon per kilo in French francs; London per pound in shillings; Milan per kilo in Italian lira. The formula for converting New York silk prices to legal currency is:</p>
<p>The formula for converting London silk prices to legal currency is:</p>
<p>The formula for converting Lyon silk prices to legal currency is:</p>
<p>The so-called additional fees include transportation fees, freight, and insurance fees. Before the war, each dan cost about 40 yuan. (Zhang Yifan)</p>

<p>White-skinned Bitter Almonds Show Upturn</p>
<p>The market for bitter almonds has tightened slightly recently. The quoted price for white-skinned bitter almonds once rose to 96. Dealers are quoting 100 yuan. Red-skinned goods are quoted at 90 yuan, and dealers are quoting 95 yuan. The trend is stable.</p>
<p>Cigarette Sales Are Active</p>
<p>Cigarette market: Because factories have changed wooden boxes to cardboard boxes, the market has become increasingly tight. At present, general hoarders, feeling the weather getting warmer, are coming out of the woodwork. Customer groups have been shipping out in large quantities in recent days because most of the certificates (removal permits) issued to the military in various places have been obtained and are waiting to be shipped, and sales on this street are also smooth, causing prices to remain strong. For example, Old Knife brand is 944 yuan, and holders are watching the market to sell. Another example is Five Flowers brand at 687 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 671 yuan, Great Britain brand at 1,297 yuan, and Pin Hai brand at 871 yuan, all with no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Black Steel Billets Rise by 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The transaction of black steel billets has been quite lively recently. Because factories on this street cannot find enough, the total daily transaction volume is always in the range of 30-40 bundles. The market situation is therefore lively, and people's hearts are also rising. I heard that yesterday's market price rose again to about 100 yuan, with each bundle of 2,000 pounds selling for 3,400 yuan. At present, because overseas sources are not continuing, and the local stock is insufficient, the trend of daily searching for goods is very strong. The market atmosphere is invigorated, and the thoughts of those in the industry are getting higher. It is feared that the market price in the future will be difficult to look small.</p>
<p>Our Nails Still Stagnant</p>
<p>The market for our factory's original nails, which has not improved for a long time, still feels sluggish. Because the business of customers from other ports is not moving, and the actual sales on this street are limited, it is difficult for the market to turn around. People's hearts are tired, and the opening price still hovers around 160 yuan.</p>
<p>Beans and Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Exported goods on the 8th included 700 bags of beans and 145 pieces of tea to Hong Kong, 130 pieces of cloth, and 88 pieces of cloth to Yangon, 500 pieces of tea to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Gao Bujian, a poet of the early Qing Dynasty, has a poem about seeking the old site of the Huangmu Temple at night in Wujing: "Fiber from the barbarian land, now planted here in abundance: woven to provide for the people, modeled after Huang Po... "Now, let's borrow these few lines as my opening remarks when talking about cotton.</p>
<p>This so-called "cotton," a plant that is so common that it is well-known to every household, is actually a genuine foreign product! Its original name was also certainly not cotton. If the Yu Gong chapter of the Book of Documents is truly a credible historical material, and if later commentators interpret the "shells" of the tribute from Yangzhou, "islanders offer woven clothing, their baskets of shells," as "the finest of tree cotton," it truly does not lose its original meaning. Then, the true name of cotton should be the "shells" that the islanders call it: or, even more credibly and reliably, it should be the "kapok" mentioned in Li Yanshou's History of the Southern Dynasties, Biography of the Kingdom of Lin Yi. Xu Wending Gong said it well in the Complete Book of Agricultural Administration: "The name of kapok first appeared in the History of the Southern Dynasties... I don't know its meaning, it is probably a foreign language from overseas." That's right, the two words "kapok" are indeed the name of the cotton plant called by the Kingdom of Lin Yi, by the barbarians: this matter is not only stated by the famous Song Dynasty monk Fayun in his Collection of Translated Meanings: "Kapok, that is, tree cotton..." providing it with an ironclad case that is absolutely difficult to overturn based on genuine linguistics; I myself have also extensively visited several foreign clergy who are proficient in many languages, hoping to trace the source and find the true meaning of the two words "kapok." The result is that the word for cotton in Indian languages is indeed "Rirpas!" Isn't this the true predecessor of kapok and 劫貝? Moreover, this word is Karpasa in Sanskrit, and it became Karpas in Persian and Hebrew. The sound of the Greek word is the same as the above, but the Latin word is Carbusa! As for the current English word for cotton, Cotton, and the French word, Coton, come from the Arabic language.</p>
<p>If this is the case, how did the name kapok gradually become "tree cotton" or "cotton"? I think the traces</p>

<p>Tales from the New Spring and Autumn Hell: Stories from the Palace of Yama by Su Cao</p>
<p>In the Palace of Yama, ox-headed and horse-faced demons stand on either side. In the center sits the majestic Yama, King of Hell. He is questioning a young ghost:</p>
<p>"Eh! Why have you returned again? You've been reborn three times, how have you returned so quickly?"</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Great King: My first rebirth was in a dilapidated house. My father was a peddler; my mother was hired as a wet nurse as soon as I was born, and I was left alone at home, never getting enough to eat. Before a month was up, I fell ill. I don't know if my mother was heartless, or if her employers wouldn't let her return, but she never came to take care of me. So, I came back. For my second rebirth, my father was a rickshaw puller, and he had three other children besides me. After I was born, I often saw them sighing and crying. After a few days, on a quiet, dark night, my father carried me, quietly went out, and placed me in a dark alley, leaving me to the wind and rain. I cried my lungs out, but no one paid me any attention. So, in less than two days, I had to come back again.</p>
<p>"So, what about the third time?" Yama seemed eager to know about his third experience.</p>
<p>"The third time?" The ghost cried. "Sadly, I hadn't even entered the human world, hadn't even seen my parents, before I was sent back."</p>
<p>"Then you should make a fourth attempt."</p>
<p>"No! Great King! I don't want to go again. Please don't make me suffer anymore!" The ghost pleaded bitterly. "They say the human world is a colorful and joyous place, but in my opinion, it's even more terrifying than our hell. I would rather be permanently lost in hell than go to the human world again."</p>
<p>"This is not a solution!" Yama frowned, turning to the judge and asking, "Do you have any suggestions? Otherwise, the underworld will inevitably suffer from a 'ghost' overcrowding problem." The judge shook his head, remaining silent. The Palace of Yama was silent, the scene even more gloomy and desolate. After a long time, the ox-headed and horse-faced demons seemed unable to bear it any longer. Without waiting for Yama's permission, they offered their opinions: "If Your Majesty were to order the capture of the parasites, treacherous merchants... from the human world, we could exchange them for a large number of unjustly dead souls. I wonder what Your Majesty thinks?"</p>
<p>Yama did not criticize this suggestion, nor did he seem to have heard it. He simply closed his eyes, as if pondering a solution to this difficult problem.</p>

<h3>Running on Ice in the Sunlight by Xu Ping (A Fictitious Story)</h3>
<p>This is a fictitious story.</p>
<p>There was a merchant who made a lot of ill-gotten wealth from hoarding, manipulating, and monopolizing goods. He recently used the exploited ten thousand yuan to build a house.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, a nameless notice was posted on the gate of this newly built house, which read: "If not from exploiting everyone, where would this ten thousand yuan come from?"</p>
<p>The man who made this ill-gotten wealth was ashamed and angry after reading it. So, he placed a large advertisement in various newspapers, offering a reward of ten thousand yuan for the capture of the person who posted the notice at the gate of his new house.</p>
<p>A day later, another notice was posted on the gate of the new house: "Already scraped together ten thousand yuan, so where does this other ten thousand yuan come from?"</p>
<h3>Begonia by Qin Shouou</h3>
<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>His uncle and cousins ​​had never seen the world, and although there were a few neighbors who were familiar with writing, he dared not interact with them casually. Apart from teasing Little Mei Bao and telling jokes, he could only sit in boredom all day long.</p>
<p>Later, he felt that he really couldn't sit still anymore. In the spring of the second year, he took off his long gown and went down to the fields barefooted, wearing straw sandals, to work with his cousin and several farmhands. However, his body was originally thin and small, and his skin was particularly fair and tender. In addition, he wore such a large piece of gauze on his face, not only never taking it off all year round, but also changing it for a new one every day. To people's eyes, it was first and foremost an eyesore. Therefore, the people of the Li family village almost all gossiped about his strange appearance behind his back.</p>
<p>However, as the days passed, people finally got used to it and no longer found it strange.</p>
<p>By the fourth year, the training of work and the scorching sun had completely transformed Begonia into a farmer on the outside. "Begonia," "Wu Yuqin," "Wu Jun"!... These names no longer appeared before his eyes or were heard in his ears. Everyone who saw him called him Lao San or Wu San. The him before the age of twenty-six seemed to have died at the same time as Luo Xiangqi.</p>
<p>Including his uncle and Mei Bao's nanny, no one would have thought that the famous actor who caused a sensation in the capital a few years ago on the red carpet was now this thin, dark, haggard farmer who looked as if he was already middle-aged.</p>
<p>For three years, Li family village was still Li family village, and everything and everyone remained the same, only Begonia had completely changed.</p>
<p>"Yi Di, you still shouldn't carry such heavy things!" One day, Begonia and Wang Si, the husband of the nanny, carried a large basket of soybeans back from the field. They were so tired that they couldn't catch their breath when they walked into their own door. His cousin, Wu Da, was pounding noodles in the yard, and he rushed over to take over for him as soon as he saw them. (127)</p>
<h3>Please Parents and Teachers, Pay Attention to Children's Health by Xi Di</h3>
<p>This is a serious and urgent request concerning the health of thousands of children in the city. Here, let me first introduce a fact to everyone:</p>
<p>On Monday morning, the parent of a student ran to our school, telling us: "One of my twelve-year-old children always complained of an itchy head when returning home from school every day. Later, after examination, we found that his hair was full of white dots. These are head lice, please pay attention to it." After receiving this report, we thoroughly checked the students' hair in each grade. The result was truly unexpected. Out of all 358 students in the school, 125 had head lice, most of them being girls. At the time, many colleagues advocated for suspending classes, but the principal insisted on opposing it. His meaning was: in this difficult era, educators are working hard and fear they are not doing enough, how can we abandon the children's studies because of a small "head lice problem"? The principal's opinion was quite correct, and the colleagues dismissed their prejudices about "suspending" classes. The general solution to this problem is to isolate those with head lice to avoid widespread infection, and to ask parents to advise boys to shave their heads completely, and girls, if they keep their hair, should keep it within reasonable limits, and usually wash their hair more often and pay attention to cleanliness.</p>
<p>This unfortunate phenomenon is not only in our school, but other schools will also have it. I always feel that it is difficult to run elementary schools today, and it is even more difficult to run alleyway elementary schools. A three-story building has to squeeze in more than 300 students, and a classroom in a wing is full of heads, accommodating 40, 50, or 60 students. Moreover, the toilet is connected to the kindergarten class, and the kitchen is connected to the sixth grade. Alas! Education? Hygiene? How easy is it to talk about?</p>
<p>However, we should not only blame the school, the school has its own difficulties! Regarding children's health issues, parents should also bear a great responsibility.</p>
<p>We often see many families where parents play mahjong at the table, neglecting their children in the alleyway, letting them fight or run around. Alas! Education? Hygiene? How easy is it to talk about?</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country. As parents and teachers, how can we bear to hinder their health and harm their physical and mental well-being?</p>

When Mrs. Roosevelt was introduced to the audience, five young men disrupted the proceedings with boos from the balcony and were escorted out. Twenty women formed a picket line outside the lecture hall, posting notices condemning the war and aiding Britain, but refused to say which group they represented. Mrs. Roosevelt refuted the arguments of Senators Wheeler and Lindbergh, but did not mention them by name. (International News Service Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Western Hemisphere French Colonies Establish Agreement with U.S., Guaranteeing No Harm to American Interests, Allowing U.S. Planes and Warships to Patrol Islands</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the United States has entered into an agreement with High Commissioner Robert, admiral in the French territories in the Western Hemisphere, guaranteeing that no activities harmful to American interests will occur within the French territories under his administration. Secretary of State Hull wrote to New York Democratic Senator Byrd, informing him that this agreement had been reached, as Byrd had previously inquired about this matter. Hull stated that the agreement stipulates that France provide "certain guarantees regarding the actions of French ships in American waters, and allow prior notification before shipping gold." The agreement also permits daily patrols by aircraft and ships on the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. The United States has dispatched one naval observer to Martinique to monitor French compliance with the agreement. The United States has agreed to expand relief efforts to the French islands and French Guiana in exchange. The U.S. government also allows a small portion of French funds frozen in the United States to be released daily so that the French islands can use them to purchase food and necessities, with the stipulation that these items may not be transported to French North Africa or mainland France. Hull also said that the United States has carefully considered various situations regarding French territories in the Western Hemisphere, "If evidence later arises that the United States must take defensive action, you can be sure that any action the United States intends to take will be in accordance with the resolutions of the Havana Pan-American Conference." (United Press Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Drafts Response to French Note</h3>
<p>Washington: The State Department is currently drafting a reply to the French note received a few days ago regarding the relationship between Vichy and Washington. The nature of this response can be easily inferred from Secretary of State Hull's remarks on France this week. It is generally observed that the remarks made by French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye on Friday may not soften the tone of this reply. There is mounting evidence that the U.S. authorities are becoming increasingly intolerant of France or its current leaders. Vichy has not been in contact with the U.S. ambassador to France, Leahy, with the candor it should have, and after Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan made bellicose remarks, the French authorities here issued a statement that Darlan's and Vichy's attitudes were completely misunderstood by the United States. All of this is particularly likely to arouse American indignation. Henry-Haye was eager to meet with Hull on Friday, but Hull refused due to a lack of time, and had to postpone the meeting until Monday, which is also very meaningful. It is rare for Hull to treat an ambassador of a country in this way. Observing the attitude of the officialdom here, it can now be asserted that after this American reply is sent out, Vichy will understand the U.S. position or the U.S. government's view of Vichy's recent actions, and there will be no misunderstanding, because this document will explain that France cannot hope to please both sides. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome: Political circles and newspapers here are paying close attention to the situation in Syria and the tense relationship between France and the United States that has resulted from it. Among them, the Tribune reports that the relationship between France and the United States is indeed extremely tense. If the two sides break off diplomatic relations as a result, the United States is bound to recognize the de Gaulle faction as the sole representative of France, but it is said that General Wavell, commander of the British Near East forces, opposes using force against Syria for strategic reasons. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye made a statement to the press this morning: "I believe German troops have landed in Syria." Newspapers here mostly use large headlines to publish this statement simultaneously with the communiqué issued by the French government, and add comments, generally stating that although France has always held a compromising attitude toward Britain, it is still determined to defend its territorial sovereignty. For example, the Washington Star, which has always advocated aid to Britain, wrote, "Previously, people generally expected Britain to strike Syria, but this has not materialized. At the same time, the tone of those in London who advocate military intervention has also tended to soften. This phenomenon of easing is unusual and unexpected, especially when Britain is accusing France of colluding with the Axis powers and Secretary of State Hull is also condemning the Vichy government's pro-German policies. The reason for this may be that Britain has to be cautious in diplomatic or military terms regarding Syria, which has led to this situation. From a military point of view, the British forces in Africa are unwilling to clash with the French forces stationed in Syria, fearing that the move to defeat the French garrison in Syria will cause French people elsewhere to defect to Germany."

<h3>British Ambassador Meets with Welles to Discuss Tense Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: British Ambassador to the United States Halifax met with U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles for thirty minutes yesterday to discuss the tense situation caused by Franco-German cooperation. The British Ambassador declined to comment on the talks. (United Press Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. officials are closely watching developments in Vichy. Among all French regions, Vietnam, Dakar, and Martinique are those whose utilization by the Germans would pose a threat to Britain and other American allies. Vietnam is on the side of the Pacific Ocean, and the Axis ally Japan has already invaded it. Dakar is on the side of the sea route to the New World, and Martinique is near the Panama Canal, the central area of Western Hemisphere defense. Fortunately, from the perspective of Britain and the United States, all the hundreds of French islands in the Pacific Ocean, from Clipperton near Mexico to New Caledonia near Australia, are either pro-Allied or under the de Gaulle Free French regime. These islands, such as the Society Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Leeward Islands, and Tahiti, if ideally controlled by Vichy and allowed to be used by the Germans, could be used by the Germans as bases for refueling and supplying raiders. At present, except for Vietnam, there seems to be nothing in the Pacific Ocean that would cause the United States to worry. Vietnam has already given extensive concessions to the Japanese military, and logically, if the area is used as a base by Germany and Japan, it could become a tool for attacking Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, or Rangoon. Although the possibility of this danger forces senior U.S. administrative authorities to pay attention to the Pacific situation, U.S. authorities are currently paying attention to the Atlantic situation because the French West African base in Dakar there can be used by the Germans as a base for aircraft, submarines, and raiders to attack British and American shipping, and it is an excellent base. The U.S. President, in his recent fireside chat, revealed that he feared that the Germans might use the area. As for other French territories in North Africa, they are very important in the outcome of the war. Many people speculate that the Germans may be able to use Algeria and French Morocco to help attack Gibraltar and drive the British out of the Mediterranean. Currently, the French forces on Martinique are close to the United States. These forces include the aircraft carrier Béarn, a heavy cruiser, and hundreds of combat aircraft. The United States has been very concerned about the actions of these French forces. Although the French forces have firmly guaranteed that they will not take offensive action and have ordered all aircraft not to fly to the Panama Canal, the Americans are very afraid that these people may one day be instructed by the Germans to attack the Panama Canal. The situation on Martinique is temporarily stable as a result of French guarantees and U.S. naval patrols in the vicinity. However, this is still a possible factor that could disrupt U.S.-French relations. (United Press Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Britain Crossing Atlantic; Winant Says Britain Determined to Fight; Germany States No Intention to Attack U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington: After leaving the State Department yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant was unwilling to confirm or deny yesterday's reports that he made remarks to senators. However, when reporters asked if there was a tendency toward peace in various parts of Britain, Winant replied, "The British government and the people are unwavering. This is a people's war, and they all know it." He also said that he was pleased to report that American aid was increasing steadily and was now crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

<p>Lisbon, Portugal: The Republic newspaper here commented today on rumors that U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant transmitted Germany's recent peace proposal, considering it unfounded and unbelievable, saying that a little thought would show that President Roosevelt would never want to act as a mediator. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: After President Roosevelt made a speech about German propaganda in the United States, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman told foreign reporters yesterday: "Germany has instructed German expatriates in the United States to state that Germany has no intention of attacking the Western Hemisphere. This is an open fact, not some secret document, and there is no need to avoid it. As for what Roosevelt said about German expatriates spreading rumors when U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant returned to the country, claiming that Britain would compromise with Germany if the United States did not aid Britain, the words of some American celebrities prove that Roosevelt's words contradict each other. For example, Willkie openly stated that if Britain cannot stop or significantly reduce the loss of ships, it will be impossible to continue the war. Didn't Hull and Lothian state in their pro-British speeches that if the United States did not increase aid to Britain, Britain would not be able to overcome its current difficulties? Roosevelt himself has made this argument. How can it be called German propaganda?" (Hai Tong News Agency Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>British and German Forces Clash with Convoys; Two German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: Last night's Admiralty communiqué stated that our convoys were attacked twice by German aircraft on the morning of the 7th. We suffered no losses or casualties. The first attacker was a Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber. Two British destroyers fired on it and shot it down. The second attacker was also only one enemy aircraft, the type of which was not identified, and was shot down into the sea by British ships. Last night's Air Ministry communiqué stated that British bomber squadrons spotted an enemy convoy off the Dutch coast and immediately attacked it. Two large ships, each with a tonnage of approximately 5,000 tons, were hit and caught fire. Both ships were probably destroyed. British aircraft suffered no losses. British fighters were very active over the English Channel, constantly patrolling, and it is believed that their activity is related to the offensive operations over northern France. Explosions were heard from across the coast yesterday afternoon. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Gibraltar's Defenses Fortified</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: Gibraltar is prepared for a German attack from the Spanish border. According to neutral military experts, German troops would have to sacrifice 50,000 men if they attacked. Military authorities believe that Gibraltar has been preparing for many years and has recently completed a secret defense design, so its fortifications are as solid as any maritime fortress. Therefore, they are not alarmed by reports that the Germans intend to attack Gibraltar. Gibraltar is ready for war. If Britain wants to control the passage to North Africa and the Near East, it must defend Gibraltar. Plans to resist any attack or siege have now been completed. In the narrow strip of land between the Spanish mainland and Gibraltar, huge, densely packed obstacles have been completed, many of which are highly secret. All the houses between the border and the Rock have been demolished, and the gunners of the defenders have an unobstructed line of sight. The attacking troops will be subjected to merciless fire from hidden stone positions. The land route to La Línea de la Concepción in Spain is full of landmines, and the attacking German troops must overcome the fortifications built by German engineers during the Spanish Civil War, and the attackers will be subject to artillery fire when they pass through the western defense line. Spanish newspapers say that the main defense against land attacks on Gibraltar is the canal system recently completed, which separates British territory from the mainland. Gibraltar has no air base on the port, so it is vulnerable to air raids, but residents can escape into the Rock and not be hit by bombs. Gibraltar has become an underground city, with hospitals, shops, food stores, and armories all protected by hundreds of feet of solid rock. Many people believe that the large amounts of military supplies and food stored underground are sufficient to cope with any siege. The positions facing the sea and other equipment to prevent sea attacks have the same strength as those facing the sea on the north side and the land side. Anti-aircraft guns have also been installed. (United Press Telegram, 8th)</p>
