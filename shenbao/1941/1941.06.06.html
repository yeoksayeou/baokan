<p>社評</p>
<h3>維希的悲運</h3>
<p>去年十二月十三日，維希政府因爲不同意拉伐爾德法合作的計畫，罷免其內閣協理一職並以達爾朗繼其後，當時一般論者，多譽爲貝當的英斷，而把那一舉視爲維希前途的一綫光明所寄託。然而近半載來的種種事實，都證明了拉伐爾個人雖吿去職，他的政治路綫却依舊在維希進行着，且已由達爾朗予以完成。在任何方面，達爾朗却恰好是拉伐爾的一個繼承者。</p>
<p>達爾朗與德方所成立的協定內容如何，至今還是一個謎。雖然上月下旬維希駐美大使海亨利曾向美保證決不以法海軍或殖民地交與德國或任何他國，但至低限度，德方之什叙利亞業已獲得種種軍事便利，已屬無可爭辯的事實。而達爾朗五月三十日在巴黎向各報訪員所發表的長篇談話，嚴厲譴責英國，並申述維希參加歐洲「新秩序」的決心，史足證明當此德方正在亟謀增厚實力以備擊敗英國之際、她所向維希要求的援助，大概是不會遇到靳而不予的。魏剛由北非返法後，維希於三日一日間兩度公開閣議，其重要性據說可比於一年前對德請求停戰的會議，並傳已決定在叙利亞及都尼斯迎擊英國，德方發言人亦復聲稱：若法國發動武力抵抗英國在叙利亞之進攻時，將獲得德方全部合作與支持。這樣顯然是維希法國又臨到了新的戰爭邊沿，將在其世讐「合作」之下，對付前此駢肩作戰的與國，此一戰爭而竟成事實、眞是一慕可痛的悲劇！</p>
<p>在目前、維希儼然已做了納粹「新秩序」的附庸，但她的動向却足以左右未來的國際大勢。近東大局的重心，不在土耳其埃及以至塞浦洛斯，而在叙利亞；假若德軍在叙利亞獲得堅强的立足點，則其進攻蘇彝士將取得新的便利，土耳其將要遭受包圍、英力對於塞浦洛斯的保衛亦將感到絕大困難。而達加爾的形勢、也早爲美國所密切注視，並視爲足以把美洲牽入戰爭漩渦的因素。到此際，不只英方的警吿不足以影響維希當局與德合作的決心，就連美國的懷柔政策，亦已失其效力。即使前述海亨利所做保證確屬可靠，而在避免在形式上以海軍與殖民地交付德國之外，在政治和軍事上還儘有許多對納粹實行「合作」的途徑，並且已有若干見諸事實。這種形勢，除却援用武力以求解決而外，別無他術可資挽救，去年奧蘭與達加爾兩役，也許英方措施過涉輕率，但現在確是到了需要斷然行動的時機。英軍之退出巴爾幹與克里特，在全盤戰略上並不能算是重大的失敗，而至低限度也使英方威望受損，且影響了若干中立國家的態度。那種鄧扣克式的撤退，今後決不容再演，而此次之在叙利亞更有爭取機先與主動的必要。</p>
<p>雖然維希是被一般反英反民治的份子所盤據，却決不足以代表最大多數法國人民的利益和要求。相沿有一百七十年歷史的「自由博愛平等」傳統，似乎不是旦夕間即能被「工作家庭與忠誠」所代替吧！貝當政權固曾一度得到法人擁護，但他們所企求的是「光榮的和平」，不是停戰協定的屈辱；是痛苦的振拔，不是長期在其歷史上的敵國變相奴役之下去建立在刺刀上的所謂「新秩序」，更不是在無可如何而放下武器之後再度以愴口朝着英國。如法人此際還有充分的作戰意志與精神，那一定是特戈爾的同志，決非達爾朗的徒黨。敍利亞雖然只是代管地，並不是不値得用武力去保衛，但那却必須純粹爲了法國，而不是爲了納粹。停戰協定的種種苛求，只有逆來順受，即在最近達爾朗積極進行談判之餘，法國所僅能獲得的也只有十萬法俘的釋回與淪陷區和自由區交通的開放，而對於德方在軍事上所需求的敍利亞、却不惜再度從事戰爭、倘若這一戰爭不是以德軍爲主力，相信其決難奏效。這無髯到是更對於英國和特戈爾派有利。而維希之把祖國前途完全寄託於極爲渺茫的納粹獲勝，其自棄戰言和之際即已注定了的悲運，必至於日益表面化而終於無從挽救。</p>
<h3>荷外長與美會商　荷屬東印度防務　日對石油供給要求過奢　談判無進展形勢極緊張</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日與荷蘭外長克里芬斯之晤談、引起京城之揣測、謂美國與荷蘭在南太平洋領土之密切防衛與具體計劃、有在最近討論之可能、衆信克里芬氏嘗携帶關於渠此次視察荷屬東印度後、該地帝之防衛之重要情報、「紐約先驅論壇報」昨評論、此數日內、日本與荷印談判、將發生劇變之消息時稱、「仟何對於荷蘭政府行動自由之威脅、美國不容忽視、此於美國予中國以精神及物質援助一層觀之、已昭然若揭」、該報謂、赫爾氏所提於和平恢復、取消在華特權之保證、暗示美國相　日本在華戰事中，將被擊敗、該報繼稱、「對華之有效援助、端賴交通、荷印適位於吾人與星洲仰光、及自出中國之中間、設日木貶荷印於越南或暹羅之卑屈地位、則將于中國與英國以重大之打擊、荷印實宜獲得此事不容發生之保證」、（五日合衆電）</p>
<p>巴達維亞　日本之經濟代表團、希望荷方於廿四小時之內、給與答覆、而荷方則華申彼等之見解、並未變更、因此此間局勢、本日更爲緊張、日方曾表示對於荷方所願意給與日本者、並不滿意、並謂或需將此事移轉至有關係之政府、因而使此項問題之經濟觀點消除、荷方則懼日本自己使用其在荷印所取得之原料、而將自泰國及越南獲得之額外橡皮及錫、用以供給德國、荷方某發言人官稱、「吾人並未確定其必將如是、但吾人不能使任何物品有落在敵人手上之機會、」衆信、如荷方仍不肯答應日方之要求，則日方代表將立即拒絕荷方之答覆云、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　荷蘭外交部長克里芬斯昨稱、日美兩國分向荷印求取戰爭原料之事、就彼所見殊無彼此利益衝突之事、「日本在台理範圍自可取得吾人所能抽出之原料、因吾人極爲講理也、但吾人不願他國在吾境內佔操縱地位、全對日石油協定、現　行順利、數日以前、又已展期半年、吾不信　人已十分滿意、蓋因日人實在難於使其滿意也」云、克氏昨與羅斯福總統互談、據其自稱、曾論及許多問題、而荷印截至現時止、尙無　到租借法案下之美國物品、查克氏此行、係從荷印澳洲紐西蘭非律濱等處、遍遊歸來、據稱荷印之防務及士氣極佳云、（五日合衆電）</p>

<h3>法軍事觀察家推測　德義今後攻勢目標　東為蘇彝士運河西為直布羅陀　德方否認將組織「歐洲合眾國」</h3>
<p>維希　此間軍事觀察家、頃就軸心國今後攻勢之方向、加以推測、咸謂、德國直接侵犯英國之議、一時似不致實現、因此今後惟有兩途可循、一即以穌彝士運河爲目標、　攻東地中海、二即以直布羅陀爲目標、而進攻西地中海、二者或同時進行、或互分先後、倘能相繼得手、則地中海將成爲德·義之「內湖」、惟是德·義·苟欲有事於西地中海、必須先在外交上有所準備、此際似尙米考慮及之、此在東地中海方面、則局勢較爲　顯、蓋以愛琴海各島已在軸心國手中、今後或則利用傘兵、向尼羅河進犯、以攻擊埃及、或則利用空軍進攻英屬塞浦魯斯島、倘就二者比較觀之、似後者較難着手、緣進攻塞浦魯斯島之艱難、以視前此之進攻克里特島、有過之無不及、蓋一則島上防務較爲充實、二則該島距英國空軍根據地較近、一旦有事、英機赴援、較爲便捷、其與軸心空軍根據地則相距頗遠、不若克里特島之近在咫尺也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談不上（六一）　大西洋戰爭面面觀</h3>
<p>河口彼岸的高射砲　放了。砲彈裝入砲膛，砲身旋轉，搜覓敵機，隆隆之聲，不絕於耳，敵機掙扎了一會，便搖搖擺擺地落了下來。</p>
<p>上面所述各種戰况，在一夜之中，曾連演了五次，直到四天以後，一艘鐵甲漁船把飛機殘骸的一部帶回，纔知所得的戰果。</p>
<p>黎明的魚肚白色，照着一個海邊小鎭。那時潮水適至，一隊漁船扯起風帆，小船上頓時異常忙碌，絞盤在鐵鏈穿過時，便開始紋動了。</p>
<p>漁船隊向海中出發，正和以前一樣，可是牠們這一次的目標是一種新式魚。他們的穿着，頗似海軍制服。不過這種正規海軍「畢挺」的服裝，穿在這班後備昌身上，似乎不很舒服。</p>
<p>漁船在海港之外，破浪前進。遇着形似小型潛艇的浮水雷擦舷而過，便放下掃雷索，那些漁船就在指定的海面進行掃雷工作。這種小艇，無間風雨，天天在英國沿海巡邏，使內海航路保持安全。</p>
<p>有時掃雷索上突受牽掣，一個黑色怪物冒出水面，後面的漁船，立刻開火，轟然一聲，海水直衝天際，航行的威脅從此又除去一個。這在大西洋戰爭中，雖似無足重輕，但終久也是敵方的一個打擊吧。</p>
<p>有時小船掃雷未成，反誤撞水雷，那末海軍部在下一天便要抱憾的宣布又損失了一艘掃雷艇了。</p>
<p>沿海巡邏各艇所遭遇的危險，不僅是在海面下。有時嗡嗡之聲，突起自天際。遠處見有黑色的一羣，顯示德國的轟炸機已成隊而來。其中一架略略搖擺了一會，便向下急衝。漁船上的機關槍手緊守崗位，待機開放，等到那一架俯衝轟炸機降至五十碼以內，便向牠毫無掩護的機首射擊。轟炸機受此致命的打擊，從茲永不能再凌空張翼了。牠直衝海面，一聲巨響，連帆檣也被撞斷，原來船機相離近在咫尺哩。</p>
<p>待到漁船鼓輪回駛，海峽之中暫時已吿肅淸。但誰知道明天早晨是吾依然沒有水雷呢？德軍或者竟夜忙碌，重施故技所以漁船在港中勉强過了一夜，便又須出港巡邏了。這種沿海的「管家婦」，日復一日的從事掃海工作。英國航業現方遭着歷來未有的威脅，所受水雷之害，允不在小。英國護航隊無論如何轉道仃駛，總須到達一個海港，這些海巷駛成爲被攻擊的目標。</p>
<p>一個沿海巾鎭的空襲警報，忽然停息，高射砲聲立刻在敵機下面爆發。全鎭本在黑暗之中，忽然照明彈向地面緩緩降下，空際通明，機關槍也軋　怒吼，希望把牠射落。旣而空中一聲長嘯，接着又是一聲巨響。頓時火光四起，炸聲不絕。一枚炸彈恰好投中防空室，或者有一百人因此死於非命。</p>
<p>這樓轟炸似乎着重海港的居民，而非海港的設備。德機的目標，似乎在男女工人，而不在他們的工廠。</p>
<p>可是夜間的空襲，並不能阻止翌晨工人上工。造船廠和船塢中，鉸釘機和起重機軋軋之聲依然不歇，工人因爲燈火管制，不能在夜間工作，便儘量改在白天。這班川流不息，每日到船塢中去的人們，也在參加大西洋戰爭呢。</p>
<p>他們雖經過一夜的緊張和恐怖，但仍在次日上工，他們須經過被破壞的房屋敎堂，和認爲唯一娛樂塲所的電影院的刦　餘燼。</p>
<p>另一幕佈景却遠離着實際的戰鬥。在倫敦一所辦公室中，許多人正埋首於各種圖表統計之間。他們精心計算，過了幾小時便發出一個通吿說，下星期肉食分配量須略爲减少了。英倫一島幾十家肉鋪之前，一班中婦們都懊喪着轉身回去，擔仟繁車的戰時工作的男子們，回到家中，坐下來吃些素食。平常工作外兼任一部份戰時工作如火災瞭望員等的男女人員，也須减少茶葉的消費，原來普　英國人都喜飲茶，一日間的銷費量，却非常之大哩。</p>
<p>各大旅館中的菜單，在若干種菜名旁邊都加着記號，暗示客人在魚肉或蛋品中，可以任擇一種，但不能兼食兩味。在大小餐館之中——大飯館中的掌廚或戴着榮譽團的帶子，小飯店中的女主人兼理買辦小菜，兒子兼做廚司和侍者——對於食物方面也在作新的試騐，把英國出產的蔬菜，用新奇的烹調方法享客，假使你是店中歡迎的老主顧，女主人可以低聲吿訴他說，已特別留下一些肉食了。</p>
<p>飯店主人和顧客，屠夫和家庭主婦，已同樣地在參加大西洋戰爭了。</p>
<p>紅日漸漸西沉，夜色籠罩着黯淡的水面。形狀嚴肅的巡洋艦，映着天際紅光，出沒於地平綫，往來巡邏，搜索敵艦。海軍部參謀處形勢永遠地緊張着，一面聽取報吿，一面把雛形的艦艇，在巨幅地圖上移動。航空站中，機械員把炸彈裝上彈架，忙碌地檢查引擎，駕駛員則攸然地吸完了他飯後的咖啡，信步逍遙。</p>
<p>這些都是此次戰爭中的鬥士。然而城市中回去吃着沒有肉，沒有糖，沒有奶油的飯食的一班辦事人員，也同樣參加着戰鬥。遠在海外的加拿大，鍊鋼廠的工作，澈夜不止，美國壁茲堡的鋼鐵廠大鎔爐火光熊熊，使夜景異常美麗。一班壯丁，正在那裏出力出汗，却不知道他們也在那裏參加大西洋戰爭，並不亞於戰地上的瞭望員呢。</p>

<h3>太平洋風雲日惡　美日衝突不可免　雙方已臨近「看牌」之勢　荷印問題漸趨嚴重階段</h3>
<p>大陸報社評云、太平洋區內戰爭之威脅、已日趨接近、美國反對日本擴張政策之效能、亦兪見增進、據稱、美國將以長距離轟炸機一百架、連同美籍飛機師與技術人員、助中國對日作戰、日內閣情報部發言人有幷宣稱、美國若果任令其航空員與機械員向美國航空部辭職、而爲中國服務、則此舉將被認爲不友好之行爲、</p>
<p>東京高唱　激烈言論</p>
<p>據稱、日人已鄭重聲明、美國若與納粹德國發生戰爭、日本勢必與美國衝突、日本半官機關報廣知報亦宜稱、日本因義務關係、不得不援助德國、同時、並請美國注意日外相松岡對於此事之正式聲明、目下日本與荷印之經濟談判、其發展尙未能使日本如願以償、東京若干報紙在其社論中、要求日政府放棄「不決之政策」、而採取嚴峻之步驟、並認爲荷印之頑强、乃由於英美在後支持之故、</p>
<p>因美援華　腦羞成怒</p>
<p>美國務卿赫爾聲明、和平恢復後、美將放棄在華之領事裁判樣、此事亦被認爲對日本之打擊、蓋因此舉愈足反映日本之侵略政策、而日本報紙竟稱赫爾致重慶新外長郭泰祺之函件、僅屬一紙具文而巳、日本認爲美國阻止其在太平洋區之發展、遂惱羞成怒、</p>
<p>預料衝突　難以避免</p>
<p>華盛頓方面、對於遠東局勢之愈形緊張、亦有所覺、美日兩國在太平洋區已臨近「看牌」之勢、吾人初非故作驚人之語、但觀於一切情形之進行、似乎公開之衝突、殆無可避免、日本竭力圖謀脫離具被軍閥所陷之困難、美國則一秉其傳統之政策、對於不可靠之人如軸心國各領袖者、決不願與之妥協、美國人民更不願採取與其道德信仰相反之行動、故日本政府除非在最近之將來改變其態度、吾則美日衝突之不可避免、殆意中事耳、</p>
<h3>宰牲塲出租　宰業恐慌　營業原已一落千丈　再受統制將無噍類</h3>
<p>上海屠宰事業、以宰猪一業而論、向分本幫蘇幫兩種、本幫籍隸江陰崇明、蘇幫大都無錫籟、分居法租界南陽橋公共租界北成都路一帶、戰前包括英法兩租界及南市閘北宰猪、作坊不下三四百家、每坊雇有夥計三四人或十餘人、宰猪一頭、不過向肉莊取費四角至七角、所有猪毛、係坊主與作夥合得、猪血爲作主所有、每天宰猪最少有三千餘頭、宰作主人、</p>
<p>獲利甚豐</p>
<p>自戰事後、南市閘北難以營業、專在英法兩租界宰猪、曹家渡徐家匯另有私人作坊、法租界宰牲塲、係假殺牛公司、每猪一頭、公司取費五角、作坊取宰費一元三角、另加肉莊及宰作會費各一角、公共租界係在北成都路新寗海宰牲塲、蘇錫宰牲塲宰猪、新寗海係本幫、每猪取公司費一元一角五分、宰費一元二角、肉莊與宰作會費二角、蘇錫宰牲塲、係各肉莊自辦、雇夥宰猪、並不需宰猪作坊宰殺、</p>
<p>相沿至今</p>
<p>歷史悠久、靠宰猪生活者、不下數萬人、自毛猪來源、受某方統制、而江北出產允少、農民因食糧價昂、蓄猪多不合算、以致全滬每天猪隻、僅有千餘頭、不敷分配、肉莊欲分得一猪、亦非易事、宰作每天有宰一猪而不可得者、亦比比皆是、該業已一落千丈、而肉價又飛漲、不料消息傳來、宰猪一業、亦須受統制、並租得工部局宰牲塲、以後兩和界之猪、概不由宰猪作宰殺、該業以數萬人生計關係、由肉業與宰猪作宰牲塲聯合、堅決反對、向各方奔走呼號、要求取消、迄今半月、尙無具體結果、今聞工部局宰牲塲已決定出租、宰作業</p>
<p>影響甚大</p>
<p>曾向各界呼籲、要求　助、而維數萬人生計、並即日推派代表、聯袂晋謁工部局負責當局、謂求保障合法營業、垂念全市萬千同業將因此舉而全體失業後、給予社會之影響、對該項租賃契約、勿予簽訂、以蘇商困、而全蟻命、</p>
<h3>英橋赴日本者　定新限制　須日外省同意　始可簽發護照</h3>
<p>據昨日此間日總領事署發表之消息、凡英籟人民今後前往日本、而向日領署請求覆簽護照者須獲得東京外務省同意後、方可批准、記者當以此舉向英總領事署詢問、據某高級職員稱、彼等尙米知悉此事、故亦不願加以批評、據消息靈通之外交界方面稱、日方對英僑所施此種新限制、足以證明英日關係之更形緊張、</p>
<h3>柯立芝輪已被徵發　最後一次航行　昨已離滬駛香港馬尼刺　克利扶倫號改下週抵埠</h3>
<p>美國總統輪船公司華麗郵船柯立芝總統號、於四日夜間抵滬、馳人浦江、載來本市主要美商若干人、柯立芝總統號此次來滬、或係目前緊急時期中之最後一次、因該輪已被美政府收買、以應亟需也、</p>
<p>昨日離滬　赴馬尼刺</p>
<p>該輪此行從火奴魯魯繞日本來滬、定昨日下午五時半啟椗離滬、赴香港小呂宋、乘客除由美乘原船赴南洋者二百八十七人外、本市乘該輪往香港小呂宋者、亦有　百十九人之多、</p>
<p>回程返美　將泊神戶</p>
<p>總統公司某員昨晨聲稱、柯立芝總統號返美途次、將在神戶停泊、離美途中從火奴魯魯來滬、則照新定航程表不在日本停泊、惟世界班各輪在離美途中、仍將灣泊日本各埠、</p>
<p>軍官十員　卽赴北平</p>
<p>搭柯立芝總統號扺滬之美商、有上海福特汽車公司經　克維·上海美國總統輪船公司經理史汀·及美國運通銀行上海分行經理列葛斯等、將赴北平之美陸戰隊軍官十員、以亞蘇斯德中校爲首、聞亞氏係赴北平任該地美軍指揮官、一九三〇至一九三三年間、亞氏曾駐防上海、此次同行者、有岑森少校等軍官九員、</p>
<p>克利扶輪　延期抵滬</p>
<p>克利扶倫總統號由小呂宋回程、經香港來滬返美、原定明日（七日）扺滬、據公司宣稱、須延至下星期三（十一日）到埠、十二日由滬向美、</p>
<p>傳傑克遜　已被徵發</p>
<p>世界班新郵船傑克遜總統號、第一度環航、依照規定船期、應於下週一（九日）抵滬、十日由滬赴南洋各埠、環航返美、前傳該郵船被美政府徵發、本市總統輪船公司尙無總行通知、故對　定客位照常辦理、惟迄令該輪尚無能否準期到滬之電吿、</p>
<h3>當局管制逐步嚴密　米商漸受約束　新訂港米貢米月內可到</h3>
<p>自工部局平價小絞米銷售以來、自辦各米、去路稀少、內地幫又鮮有購進而本街各戶、又多注意平價小紋米、大有供過於求之勢、最近洋行界曾接仰光暹難來電、拋售小絞及二號暹羅、雖將其價儘量抑低、但終無人問津、若洋米源源湧到、今後市塲米價、將益代落、故正當米商、此後將經營工部局平價小絞米、以求正當利潤、免遭意外損失、</p>
<p>越界區售　米應報吿</p>
<p>昨據公共租界工部局負責人語記者、越界築路區域內之米號　自今日起、須至外灘一號祥茂洋行領取報吿冊、每日塡報出售工部局洋米之數量、及買戶之住址、各米號塡就後、即呈繳與該區管轄捕房、以備當局查考、如延不履行上項手續、則將取消其出售之權利、</p>
<p>二批港米　已訂萬噸</p>
<p>工部局自出售平價港米後、第一期早已售　、茲第二期亦將於周內開始發售、各雜糧行均繼續前往訂購、殊爲踴躍、聞昨日一日間、前往祥茂洋行訂購之數量、達二千餘噸、連前合計約在萬噸左右、定米洋行由十二家增至十六家、工部局現已將各米行所定數額、電知香港政府、請迅即派輪載運來滬、聞本月十日前即可抵滬、</p>
<p>平價貢米　本月裝船</p>
<p>關於本市法租界公董局自向越南政府接洽、直接訂購一·二號西貢混合碎米運滬平價發售後、前曾由法當局與本市米業界數度往返磋商代爲發售事宜、並經規定經售米商應得利潤爲（一）米行百分之八、（二）米號百分之五、凡各洋行成交後須由法當局登記、茲悉法商達孚、英商合義等洋行、先後已成交者、總數已達一千噸左右、其成交價格、大都在九十七八元左右、昨據各該洋行負責人談稱、今該項已成交之平價貢米、可於本月份如數由產區裝船、大約於本月底可先後扺埠轉售由民、</p>
<p>經售港米　必須登記</p>
<p>自第二批平價小絞米分派後、本埠各零售米號、均向瑞昌發等十二家雜糧行購買、惟其中間有少數米號、過去未塡寫「經售工部局洋米申請書」、由立基洋行備案者、洋米代辦機關、暫不予核准認購、此後零售米號、欲經售工部局之平價小絞米者、應迅速補塡經售工部局洋米申請書」即交由購入之雜糧行並塡三聯成單、同時轉交立基或祥茂洋行、審核許可後、始得發售、</p>
<p>市塲掮客　至感狼狽</p>
<p>米市塲內之二百餘掮客，平日專靠買賣戶成交之佣金收入、多者二三百元、少者亦五六十元、每月收入、頗爲可觀、但自平價小紋米源源抵滬後、市塲交易頓形减少、前昨兩日、允感淸淡、因之一般掮客、不能施展平日技倆、情勢甚爲狼狽、不勝今昔之感、</p>
<h3>商午職工索薪　資方要員未延見　王耀堂擺脫關係</h3>
<p>商務廠方同人代表團昨日上午、分至工部局工業科及王耀堂律師事務所聽取回昔、王律師表示勞方處境確爲可憫、本人甚表同情、資方態度固執、又避不見面、無法着手進行調解、本人已決定對於此事脫離關係、不加過問、工業科負責人云、望代表團對於三七二號通吿之具體意見、提交轉吿資方、或可由工業科居間個別談判、代表團認爲前途仍甚黯淡、加之五月份下半月應得薪水、又延不發給、當決定領導被裁百餘職工、分至經理鮑慶林及港派專員李伯嘉家中請願、要求人數雖多、但秩序異常良好、未有絲毫損失、鮑經埋避不見面、由鮑夫人接談、至下午四時許、捕房派來大批警探、將大衆趨離鮑家、李伯嘉家中無法入內、同人等祇得冒雨而返、</p>
<h3>密豐廠工人與警備　西籍日籍警員受傷　工人三名頭部重傷</h3>
<p>滬東鄱陽路四〇〇號密豐絨綫廠於昨（四）日上午五時卅分曾釀成工潮暴動案、當有楊樹浦捕房西籍試用巡長馬律遜及捕房日籟警員一人受傷、緣該廠發生工潮後、是日下午五時卅分、所有工人均被拒入廠內、羣集路旁、工人要求廠方發給工資、惟被廠方所拒絕、所有男女工人叫百名、遂與資方衝突、楊樹浦捕房據報後、亟派警員馳往彈壓、並驅散工人羣衆、當時工人均未聽從、巡捕遂以警棍逮捕工人八名、帶回偵訊、當互毆時、西籍巡長馬律遜額膝等部均受擊傷、當送院醫治、日籍警員亦受輕傷、而工人三名則均重傷頭部、嗣即送入巡捕醫院醫治、一時尙難出院、</p>
<h3>銀行董事大學職員　先後被匪綁去　張伯駒在亞爾培路遇匪　施肈康係由三俄人綁架</h3>
<p>前昨兩日間、本埠發生綁案兩起、被綁者一需鹽業銀行董事張伯駒、一爲聖約翰大學註冊主任施肇康、兩人被架後、均無下落、茲分誌谷情如次、</p>
<p>鹽業董事　昨晨被綁</p>
<p>昨日法租界亞爾培路、有鹽業銀行總稽核張伯駒、被匪連車綁去、旋失車即吿發現、惟張下落不明、茲將該綁案經過情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>任職多年</p>
<p>河南人張伯駒、年四十四歲、滬寓法租界亞爾培路一六八弄培福里十六號洋房內、張向任本埠北京路二八〇號鹽業銀行董事、兼總稽核之職、業已多年、平日張出入雖乘有黑牌六〇一〇號汽車、但該車爲該行之公事車、供張乘坐、而非爲自備者、</p>
<p>突遇綁匪</p>
<p>昨晨、張因有同鄕友人盧某、乘輪由北平抵滬、張乃於八時許早餐後、即出外登車、擬先往法租界外灘羅斯福碼頭迎候盧某後、再赴行辦公、不料車甫出弄口、突由路旁躍出綁匪三名、將車攔住、各出手槍、躍登車上、將司機揚州人孔慶和驅逐下車、</p>
<p>汽車發現</p>
<p>該車乃由匪自行駕駛、疾馳而去、綁架無踪、司機孔慶和、見匪已去、遂據情報吿張家轉報法捕房、經派探捕馳往勘察一過、並嚴令所屬注意偵查、迨至上午十時四十五分、始出捕房在巨籟達路五〇八號門口發現該號汽車、當即通知由司機孔慶和前往認領、但張則仍無下落、</p>
<p>大學職員　竟遭架走</p>
<p>聖約翰大學註冊主任施肇康、年三十七、前晨九時十五分、離極司非而路一八八號校舍、雇人力車返康腦脫路自寓、途經曹家渡、忽有汽車一輛隨後追到、</p>
<p>竟加手銬</p>
<p>車中竄出三俄人與二華人、均持槍械、將施氏强曳下車、銬以手銬、然後擁登汽車、沿極司非爾路疾馳而去、該車照會號碼、未經披露、查聖約翰大學於一年前遷回兆豐公園後原址時、施氏等職員若干人首先返校、</p>
<p>政治動機</p>
<p>此次被架、諒出政治動機而匪黨中有三俄人、乃上海綁案中所罕見、滬西特警現正偵查此案、並予聖約翰大學其他職員以特殊保護、惟昨日尙未捕獲嫌疑犯、本市敎育界人士多與施氏相識、驥聞此訊、頗爲震動、</p>
<h3>米價日跌　履業减工資　爲工潮發生以來　减低工資之矢</h3>
<p>本埠製履業勞資雙方、曾於本年四月間、因勞方要求增加工資、發生糾紛、工潮僵持匝月、嗣由雙方部份解決、一律增加工資三成、常時雙方簽訂條約、言明米價跌落時、增加部份、隨時减低、邇來工部局自辦港米維持民食、米價遂日趨下跌、該業工資、於本月份起、按照比例、亦减低二成、</p>
<h3>人力車身背面　廣吿問題　公共租界已經核准　法公董局尙待商洽</h3>
<p>利用公用人力車身背面作廣吿之計劃、雖經公共租界工部局核准、但仍有困難、蓋聞法租界公車局不許界內人力車作此廣吿也、查公共租界人力車均可行駛於法租界、若利用車身背面作廣吿、該車即不得入法租界、故是項計劃之能吾實現、尙成問題、有關方面或將再度商諸法公董局、且觀於工部局旣予允准、一般人乃認法公董局或將撤銷此禁、按工部局對於作此廣吿之人力車、擬徵每月一元之特別稅、且不得使用紙張廣吿品、而所有廣吿品、應先得警務處之核准、</p>
<h3>竊賊冒充調查員　闖入西橋家</h3>
<p>法租界警務當局、近據報有冒充衛生稽查員之竊賊、自稱係衛生處專家、至西僑住宅內假借調查爲名、曾有西僑失竊現金及貴重物件甚多、故特週密研究眞相、偵查案犯、並警吿公衆妥予注意、</p>
<h3>寄亞美歐洲各地　航空郵件途徑　歐洲各地郵件美機運最捷　全程由港起飛為時僅兩週</h3>
<p>歐洲發生戰事以後、航運船隻之减少、以及各沿海口岸之進入封鎖狀態、寄往國處歐洲各地郵件、已不經蘇彝士運河、郵局為策安全、均改道太平洋航綫取道美國循大西洋運歐洲各國家、是以本埠外國行商、對寄往上述各地郵件、爲求迅速、均交由航空寄遞、由美航機飛剪號帶運、據向郵局方面探悉、關於寄往歐美各地近東馬來亞英屬新加坡、法屬安南航郵錢途經如下、</p>
<p>亞洲方面</p>

<p>可可（Cacao）的風味是那麼甘美和雋妙，以致瑞　大植物學家Linne直改稱其樹Cacaoyer的名字爲「神糧樹！」這雖然是由於口腹的感德懷恩，可也是根據着墨西哥自古流傳的軼聞哩。軼聞是這麼樣說：『可可樹本生在太陽神最初的子孫所居住的那「樂國」裏，—幸福的樂園，是爲無論古今中外，文明野蠻，一總的人所憧憬着的！——有個名叫Quatzaleautl的先知園丁，把它的種子帶到世界上來：這原是神們所享用的食品啊……」所以自古以來，墨西哥人崇拜珍視這可可樹，以爲它供給的食品是最珍美和最優越的，而且具備着不可思議的效能。</p>
<p>可可樹是熱帶的常綠喬木，有丈七八尺高，木白多孔，極輕脆，枝灰色。葉互生，下垂，形橢圓，端尖，光綠，非常的大。花小，五瓣，色紅或黃，叢生於葉腋，然而允其普通的，是孤零零的生於老幹半腰或粗枝子上。果爲下垂的核果，俗名叫作Cabosse，有五六寸長，重量從一百到五百格蘭姆，也是橢園形，頂端尖，色紅黃，皮澀，有十條縱行深講。每果約含廿五到四十粒種　，—就是可可—分作五瓣，鑲嵌在粉紅色而帶膠滯性的肉襄裏。肉熟酸美，可生吃，也可以造成一種士人所極爲嗜愛的飲料。可可仁的有七八分長，半寸寬，焙炙後，就可以造成所謂可可粉了。根據化騐分析的結果：可可的含奶油質百分之五十，蛋白質百分之十一，礦物質百分之四，澱，粉膠　，細胞膜質等共百分之三十二。總之，可可裏頭包括着各種成分，極富含氮物，在最小的質量裏容納着極多的滋養料，實在是最好最理想的一種食品！公元一五二〇年征服墨西哥的西班牙人Cortez，誇大可可的品質甚至於說：『一個人只吃碗這寳貴的融液，就可以行走終日，不需要再吃旁的食物！』</p>
<p>古墨西哥人的重視可可，又可以從他們把它作流通的貨幣看出來。貨幣的單位，有所謂le　countle，等於二百個可可；le　Xiquipal等於八千個可可；而le　carga則價値二萬四千個可可。譬如Cortez征服墨西哥的時候，濱臨墨西哥灣的一個名叫Tabasco的城市，每年須向國王Montezuma進貢一千個Xiquipal，就是一千六百萬可可！而Cortez得到的戰利品却是四萬袋！（未完）</p>
<h3>長生果　（續）</h3>
<p>— 李毓鏞</p>
<p>我國最先栽堵的是南部沿海，汀州府志云：「出西國，俗名番豆。」漳州府志云：「出西國昔年無之，」彙書云：「此種皆自閩中來。」當時產量很微，需要也不顯。後來蔓延到中部，漸漸知道利用，1791年意大利牧師馬先託內氏以爲中國，氣候適官花生，允以江西省長江北岸爲佳。後來英國有一位安穆哈司特卿，也發表花生宜於中國的談話，很引起歐人的注意，十九世紀末，廣東花生油供不應求，致栽培推廣到北方，當時有美國聖道堂傳敎土湯姆生Audrdeacon　Thompson）者，帶了一加崙的大莢花生到上海，遇到長老會的米博士（Dr．Charled　R．Mills）湯氏分一半的種子給他，米氏到山東登州把種子分給兩個敎友去種，叫他們　年之內只作播種，不要用掉，後來有一個敎友不守的，把種得的花生吃光了，幸而第二個敎友照他吩咐，三年後把收得的種，分給農民去種，因爲種子很大，農民都樂於播種。</p>
<p>照當地一向的習慣，榨生油是不去殼的，他們第一次用大莢花生榨油，遭到失敗因爲榨出來的油，被厚殼吸收去了，大家很是灰心，後來有人敎他們去了殼，成績非常良好，山東的花生因此非常繁殖，成為出口的大宗，據說蓬萊縣公署前還有一個石碑立着，紀念這位介紹者的功績呢，（完）</p>

<h3>參觀華東六大學畢業典禮</h3>
<p>— 趙爾謙</p>
<p>在晨光熹微天有雨意的氣氛下、南京路上有無數靑年、身著畢業禮服、羣集於外國靑年會的禮堂、然後排隊齊向大光明影戲院出發、隊中有男有女、有老有少、華洋雜處、濟濟一堂、有的是鶴髮童顏、有的是少年英俊、他們的衣冠與衆不同、具有中古的神秘色彩、很莊嚴的緩步的前進、因此頗惹起市民驚奇的注視、想不到在這個商業心臟的中區、發現上海最高學府的精英、這是華東六大學畢業典禮的起始、</p>
<p>到了大光明後、授予學位典禮、立即起始、先由下舫濟博十祈禱、在他的禱文中、大家都聽見他用嚴肅虔誠的語調、爲中國的幸福·統一·合作·興盛祈求、一字一白、打到每個人的心弦、次由李培恩博十致詞、樊正康先生訓詞、而最動人的當然是力宣德博十的演說、他以演說家的姿態、說明宗敎道德敎育之重要、受過最高敎育的大學生、應該負起責仟、創造一個新世界、學生是一種力量、是安定這個擾攘世界的因素、</p>
<p>昨日來賓極多、率皆學生的親屬和友好、他們含笑歡迎畢業生入席、若不勝其慶幸者、而數百畢業的靑年、亦復笑逐顏開、在勇往直前的精神下、按步不前、一若將要結婚的新娘在禮堂的地毯上寸步難行者、</p>
<p>畢業典禮在隆車的空氣中舉行、每一節目、均有人攝影、因爲大光明塲內黑暗、攝影不易、因之燐火四起、宛如希特勒的閃電戰爭、眩人心目、不過我們望她成績好、爲華柬六大學的畢業生、留下一個紀念、</p>
<p>管子曾經說過、「十年樹木、百年樹人」、敎育本來不是一件易事、而戰爭時期的敎育、尤難支持、然而華東六大學在中日戰爭中的第四年、猶有四白個大學畢業生這誠然是對於國家的一種貢獻、我們更希望道「四百尊羅漢」能努力如宣德博士所言擔起責任、造成一個新中國、</p>

<h3>關於「加薪」</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>物價的上漲，跟着來的是薪水階級的加薪要求，要是碰到雙方固執成見的話，那末，工潮糾紛等等的事情，就由此而形成。這，在今天巳成爲大家都知道的常識了。</p>
<p>日前（三日），我們在各報上又看到工部局要加薪的消息，這，我們該爲工部局的職員們慶幸，而認爲執租界行政樞紐的工部局當局不失爲一賢明的處置。但我們希望工部局方面能在抑平物價上施行治本的「手術」，另方面我們更盼望工部局的加薪能注意到下面最重耍的一點：</p>
<p>就是，按照薪水一律加百分之幾的這種加成頭的辦法是吾合理的問題。</p>
<p>這裏，先就這加成頭的利幣兩方面來說：</p>
<p>在利的方面，僅僅是爲了結算上的便利，其他我們找不出更充分的理由來了。</p>
<p>但在弊的方面講，就造成了這樣的結果：薪水大的，大得收不小，而小的跟大的相差就越跑越遠，可是在今天，吃飯的肚子，却是全社會，不，全人類都長得一樣大，而且，越窮的人，却越吃得不飯。</p>
<p>譬如說：一個賺兩千塊錢月薪的人（在工部局裏拿道樣薪水的人，是不能算少的）。再加上原來百分之一百五十的津貼費已經有五千了，現在再要加百分之四十，那不是耍快變成六千了嗎？這些朋友無論怎樣也用不了這許多錢，於是就拿剩下來的錢去做不必要的消耗，結果，反而幫助造成了今日社會上的不正常和窮人生活費的更一天高似一天，而工部局的加薪也就永遠不會停止，我們想，這不見得是合理的加薪方法吧。</p>
<p>所以，我們認爲，一方面求合理的生活要求是應該爲大多數人着想，一方而不妨採取這樣幾種方法：</p>
<p>一，不論薪水的大小，一律加多少。</p>
<p>二，五十以下加多少，一百以下加多少，以下則二百三百的類推。</p>
<p>三，或是增發米貼，像工部局現在的辦法，不論薪水大小，一律發給，因爲吃飯是一樣吃的，這就是合理的辦法。</p>
<p>上述三種辦法，我們願意誠意地提供給工部局作爲加薪研究的參考，因爲現在採用這種方法的除海關，郵局外，電力，電話，電車等公司也都實行得很好的。而且，這不僅可以節减工部局的支出，允其，對社會上的調節，也不無益處</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲工部局所加的薪旣稱之爲「臨時生活津貼費」那末，要附合使人能「生活」，該是最低限度的合理條件吧！</p>
<p>同時，也盼望其他的機關學校，商店，或書館等，也該學學工部局！</p>
<h3>遲與早</h3>
<p>— 殷古</p>
<p>西裝甲：「海，只差一分鐘啦，蠻好方才少跳一圈，「血染山河」一定開塲了。」（心灰意懶）西裝乙（雀躍迎出）：「老兄，還好，剛在映幻燈廣吿呢……。」</p>
<p>舞客甲（汽車裏跳下）：「什麼！十一時的草裙舞……，噯，該死，我的錢怎會慢……眞該死！」舞客乙：「哈，你眞太要「看」啦，門也沒進，怎知……；草裙舞還沒上台哩，眞神經過敏。」</p>
<p>（甲拍掌大笑，連連：心理作用，心……）</p>
<p>吃，也不好差一點……赴宴者（在黃包車裏）：「唉！冷盆怕過了，噢，還有那隻魚翅……（忽忽跨進禮堂。）</p>
<p>招待員：「Oh，某先生够眼福，快去見禮。」</p>
<p>（原來證婚人剛在致詞。</p>
<p>他自己不覺好笑，但一邊却心花怒放，吃全家福啦）。</p>
<p>三房客：「啥格，電燈熄了，三圈牌也沒到……。」</p>
<p>（一張脾碰的一跳。）</p>
<p>二房東（大聲）：「你去看看鐘點看正十二點啦，十二點熄火末，老規矩嘮。」（三房客急燃燭起視，十二時尙缺一分，想爭，於是正十二時了。）</p>
<p>母：一毛頭，跑快點，平糶米（難則不是這般稱呼了，但窮人還是這般稱呼！）要賣完了……白跑橫豎兩條腿，餓可挨不起……</p>
<p>兒（氣喘喘）：「媽，曹家渡跑來，我走也走不動，還要跑……」（待到達，米店門也還沒開，但飢餓的一羣已長長排着。她倆還是遲的？）</p>
<p>導女：「先生，你說叫二小時……對不起，到啦！」（她忸怩着。）</p>
<p>客（戀戀不捨）：「怎麼你這般留心着鐘點啊？」（女悵然。）</p>
<p>這是在大旅社的某個房間裏。</p>
<p>失業者（讀報）：「……不供膳宿，月薪八元……做事須吃苦耐勞，備有殷實舖保……於×日下午二時，親至本處接洽……。」</p>
<p>所謂「本處」的壁上鐘點：「一時十分。」（門口的人已擁擠不堪。）</p>
<p>這個「失業者」汗珠涔涔弁至，手裏揑着張×角×分的電車票。</p>
<h3>俠客仗義記　—馬路巡閱</h3>
<p>— 之達</p>
<p>我在馬路上溜躂着。偶然在那邊，看見有位中西女性，談笑自然，才從一間點心店內出來，手中各拿了袋美味的點心。才走到馬路中，背後就跟來了一個乞丐，突然把中國女子手中的一袋美味的點心，攫到汚穢的手中。照理他就應該很快的奔逃了，然而不知道是爲了經騐　　他用不着跑得快呢，還是爲了年紀老而跑不快，或者是爲了餓得無力而跑不快？總之是跑得不快。</p>
<p>至於那一位摩登女郞，或者是爲了要保持優美的體態，也或者是為了大量的原故，也不追，也不怒，只不過淡恬的，發出了動人的笑容。</p>
<p>可是故事並沒有完結。突然從旁邊閃出來了一位俠客、是外國俠客，他很機警，旣輕又快的就捉住了犯人，那叫化子自然不免飽受了一頓打，也自然的沒有動手抵抗。不幸的是一袋美味的點心，被丟了一地，俠客踐踏了牠，以表示他內心的氣憤而已。</p>
<p>自然每一個走路人也都立停了覜看，可惜我已不及再觀看每一個看客的臉容，就上了公共汽車。即使把頭伸出去，也已經看不淸楚了，公共汽車決不爲了我要看而停下來的；只聽得背後的一個乘客，發出了「嘿哈」的一笑，我也猜不出笑的是什麼「味道」。</p>
<p>我在車上閉住了眼睛。</p>
<h3>有這未一天</h3>
<p>— 常言道製</p>
<h3>夏</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>有許多人爲盼望夏之降臨，可憐頭頸已經伸長了十二個月！</p>
<p>曰：『一年四季，春夏秋冬。唯夏，可以大出其風頭！』</p>
<p>立夏，端陽，鹹鴨蛋粽子都已吃過，誰還會强詞奪理硬說這是冬天？那末，夏來了！</p>
<p>夏來了，千言萬語，從何說起？「我們」君子務本，目以風頭爲至上，爲第一。</p>
<p>二十世紀是「文明」時代，野蠻習氣應當一掃而光。所以出風頭並非殺人放火，而是「炫耀」。</p>
<p>從皮鞋白到牙齒，從脚背　到頭髮，「君子」也；袒頸，露臂，裸足，赤腿……「淑女」也。一「窈窕」，一「好逑」；於是無往而不「炫」，無走而不「耀」，國家大事儘可「管他娘」，風頭却不可不出！</p>
<p>夏天「走」的地方也極多：舞塲戲院之外，游泳池飲冰室都是上好「避暑地」；並且，聽說眼睛還可以吃「冰洪淋」……</p>
<p>眞是大哉我夏，美哉我夏，優哉游哉。</p>
<p>如果誰橫腰裏截出來說：『夏天的「臭蟲」討厭呢』！你就準是個十足的笨坯；因爲在「君子淑女」的腦子裏就始終沒有存在過「臭蟲」兩個字！</p>
<p>旣然這樣，再不必說別的話；不過要寫起夏來啊，像小學生『春天去了，夏天來了，天氣好熱……』的文章也好寫上，「洋洋灑灑」幾十萬言，但我想在這兒打住已經很够了，是不是？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的莊稼人</p>
<p>時間是最不饒人的，一晃眼三個年頭又在不知不覺中溜過去了。但在這一個差不多完全與世隔絕的李家莊內，却什麼也不曾改變：三年前田裏種的是麥子，高梁，棉花；到現在也還是這樣。三年前莊裹祇有四五十份人家，如今也還保持着這個記錄，一家也不多，一家也不少。老黃牛天天跟着主人下田去，疲憊的瘦騾，拖着笨重的大車，在小路上往來，簡直什麼也沒有改變。</p>
<p>假使一定要說有些改變的話，那末第一個就要數到吳三了。</p>
<p>三年前一個深秋的傍晚，在日光已給黑暗呑剩不到一半的時候，莊子裏每一份人家的大門差不多全掩上了，灰黃色的田野裹，祇剩幾個頑皮的孩子的身影在浮動着；突然，從東面駛來了一輛騾車，悄悄地在吳老爺家新蓋的那所大瓦房的前面停住了，接着便有好幾個人從車上下來，給吳老爺引進屋子去，末了吳家的兩三個抗活的又打車子上搬下了許多的東西來，有箱籠也有綢籃，很像是吳家的親戚特地來投靠他們的。</p>
<p>第二天早上，吳老爺便提着一支旱烟管，親自到各家去邀了一二十個上年紀的人，到他家去喝酒，說是他的姪兒老三在天津死了媳婦兒，沒人照看那個三歲的小姑娘，所以爽快搬回那裏來住了。</p>
<p>大家到他家裹去一看，他的姪兒也還不過是一個二十五六歲的小夥子，穿着挺齊整的長衣，很像個生意人模樣，人也非常和氣，見了這些老頭兒，恭恭敬敬的叫着老伯老叔：只是有一件事情很古怪，那就是他臉上所紥裏着的一大塊白布了！（二一五）</p>

<h3>上海話劇界的最近動態</h3>
<p>— 茜蒂</p>
<p>今　是「話劇年」。</p>
<p>這裹我們願意爲游藝界讀者報道一點上海話劇界的最近動態。今日興起的話劇團體，其性質，大概可以別爲二類，便是「職業」的和「業餘」的。「職業」劇團，現在有「上海劇藝社」，「中旅」，「天風」，和不久之前由電影界的優秀演員合組的「華聲」。「上海劇藝社」靠着「家」的賣座興隆，便站住了脚，此刻正在上演吳祖光的「正氣歌」。這是個偉大的古裝歷史名劇，裏面叙述着文天祥忠心愛國的一段可歌可泣的史實，由吳江帆導演。演員的陣容，相當堅强，電影界如周起，藍蘭，韓非等，都參加客串，而石揮的起文天祥，猶如過去劉瓊的飾鄭成功，熱情橫溢，動人肺腑，使觀衆在離塲以後，尙有不盡之回味，此類話劇，眞値得推荐。</p>
<p>「中旅」現在演出的是「洪宣嬌」，性質與「正氣歌」類同，此劇先演於蘭心。博得社會贊許，現借卡爾登塲地續演，賣座始終不衰。編劇人是魏如晦，導演是費穆，服裝設計是胡旭光。據云美成影片公司，已決定將「洪官嬌」搬上銀幕，仍請原班人馬唐若靑等分任角色，包銀打破電影界歷來紀錄，可謂優厚之至。「天風」似乎是在時裝劇方面找出路，現在在璇宮演出的是「恩與仇」，此劇原名「紅粉喋血記」，是于伶原作，由吳琛改編，羅朋導演。「華聲」在過去會演過幾個獨幕劇，可惜都沒有好的成續。此决預備再接再厲的借蘭心上演，江上靑的「精忠報國」。這是個叙述岳飛的故事。演員陣容，已支配妥當的，計有：王獻齋的秦檜，黃河的岳飛，陳琦的銀屏娘，周起的牛臯，（餘略）他們準備二十日起演，道幾天正在美成廠積極排練中</p>
<p>「業餘」劇團，多得不可計數，如尤光照田振東主持的「正風」，蔡冰白曹振中領導的「虹影」，其他有「微微」，「藝林」，以及各大中學組織的，銀錢業，華聯俱樂部等許多劇團。「正風」的人才太少，尤光照每天晚上穿了印度綢長衫，在小小的客堂間裹，流着汗，反靠着手，踱着方步，嘴裏唸着台詞，給社員們一面講，一而做手勢，精神可佩！「虹影」以歌劇的姿態出現，現在擁有男女社員達六十餘人，其中大都爲學界中人，他們辦事都很幹練，前在抂后演「賣花女」，獲得好評，該劇由蔡冰白編導，並由張昊作曲，最近或將在大上海重演一次。在九月間，他們還要演出一個像「綠野仙蹤」般的神話劇，劇情非常有趣，意義絕對嚴肅，仍由蔡冰白編導。蔡君對於歌劇方面，研究有素，「上海之歌」一砲即響，此一神話劇，乃其第二砲，預料成績必是不凡，歌劇迷們，當可刮目以待。</p>
<p>寫到這裹，我應該下個結論了。我以爲：話劇團體的興起，固然是一種好現象，然而每個人必須站在自己的崗位上才對，一味只以「賺錢」爲宗旨，「消遣」作目標，那是錯誤的，要不得的。我們要記住這苦難時代所給予劇人的使命，是甚麼。</p>

<h3>Hua Ru Obtains U.S. Military Aid; A Major Counteroffensive Will Be Launched This Autumn; Japan Faces a Military Deadlock in China, Unable to Advance or Retreat; Its Southern Advance Is Highly Risky and Dares Not Be Attempted Lightly</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to well-informed Chinese sources here, Japan has not yet decided whether to advance southward or deeply into the Chinese interior. The Chinese army, however, expects to receive sufficient American weaponry this autumn and will then launch an offensive. Barring unforeseen developments and with the rapid and large-scale influx of American aid, China is unwilling to remain on the defensive for long. China only needs aircraft, artillery, and mechanical equipment to launch a large-scale counteroffensive against the Japanese army in China. All indications suggest that this equipment will soon be continuously supplied by the United States. After the arrival of the weaponry, some time will be needed for training and organization before its effectiveness can be displayed on the battlefield. A portion of this weaponry will also be used to protect China's vital communication lines and major base areas. With the continuous inflow of overseas war materiel, when this work is completed, the world will witness a significant change in Sino-Japanese relations. Where the Chinese army will begin its counteroffensive is a secret of the Chinese military headquarters, unknown to outsiders. However, it can be predicted that the Chinese army will certainly launch a fierce offensive at a location that will bring China the greatest economic, military, and political value. At the same time, this offensive will be of a nature that will make the deepest impression abroad. Barring unforeseen developments, the Chinese army is expected to launch its offensive this autumn, around September. As for Japan, it is currently in a dilemma, unable to advance or retreat. To advance southward would risk a major war with Britain and the United States. To attack Chongqing would lead to a deeper and deeper quagmire. It hesitates and cannot make a decision. Recently, there has been much talk of Japan's imminent southward advance, with the following reasons given: (1) Since Japan's policy is based on the idea of Axis victory, Japan will inevitably seize the various countries in the South Seas that possess dangerous terrain and abundant resources before the end of the European war, lest Japan has no reason to enjoy them and lets Germany choose the best and take them. (2) Britain and the United States are currently preoccupied with Europe, making this the best time for Japan to seize the South Seas. (3) Given the progress of the international situation, the most likely contender with Japan for dominance in the Pacific is the Dutch East Indies, as its forward base. If Japan can attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies in a blitzkrieg and occupy them before the completion of Anglo-American joint defense, then Japan can eliminate once and for all the future crisis of a power contending with Japan in the Pacific. (4) With the war against China having reached a stalemate, there is a strong demand within Japan for active southward expansion. To cope with this demand and to divert popular resentment arising from the failure of its China policy, the Japanese government may decide on a major operation in the South Pacific. (5) Many Japanese believe that a southward advance is an effective way to resolve the war against China, as it would completely cut off the sea lanes for British and American aid to China. At the same time, there are also reasons why Japan dares not advance southward. If Japan takes such an unwise risk, it will inevitably lead to a major war with Britain and the United States, and it cannot expect active assistance from Germany. If it loses the war, Japan will not only have to withdraw completely from China but will also face disaster in Japan proper. If the war is prolonged, its military position in China will also become weaker and weaker, and Japan has no assurance of Germany's final victory in the European war. While Japan hesitates and is unwilling to make a major southward advance, there is no shortage of voices within Japan urging it to devote all its efforts to attacking Chongqing. To do this, Japan would have to concentrate all its manpower to fight a long, extremely difficult battle in the inaccessible interior of China. Even if it manages to capture Chongqing, the war would not be over, because the Chinese army could still move west, northwest, or southwest and continue fighting. Japan would not be able to end the war in one or two years. If a major change occurs in the international situation at that time, Japan will find that its strength is exhausted and it is unprepared to confront other major powers. Amidst this wavering, Japan has launched a peace offensive in Britain and the United States, hoping to induce them to compromise with Japan on Pacific issues, so as to obtain the most favorable terms without risking a major war. Washington has viewed this movement with indifference, much to Japan's disappointment. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports Intensified Sino-British-American Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Nichinichi Shimbun" today prominently published a report from Shanghai stating that China, Britain, and the United States have intensified military cooperation to strengthen their defenses in the South. They have determined that the recent American preparations to participate in the European war will inevitably cause Japan to take military action. Regarding this matter, the three countries are now vigorously constructing an "air defense system" to counter Japan. This system will be revealed when war breaks out. The "Nichinichi Shimbun's" special dispatch from Shanghai also stated that China, Britain, and the United States, with British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham as the supreme commander, are jointly establishing an anti-Japanese air defense line, with Singapore and Manila as the main bases, to defend the Malay Peninsula, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and southwestern China. Regarding this, the three countries have already begun constructing a huge air base, with Singapore as its center. The British have also installed 18-inch long-range artillery and anti-aircraft guns at key positions on the Malay Peninsula. Eighty British, American, and Australian warships, including submarines and aircraft carriers, have intensified their defenses in the South Seas. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" also claimed that the United States is assisting China with aircraft, airmen, mechanical technicians, and gasoline to quickly rebuild its air force bases, which have been destroyed by the Japanese navy and air force over the past three years. The United States recently decided to supply China with 500 to 800 aircraft, including Flying Fortresses. It is reported that as of May 11th, 35 American technicians and more than ten airmen had arrived in Chongqing via Hong Kong and are currently supervising the construction of aircraft and training Chinese pilots at various designated locations.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Vichy</h3>
<p>Last December 13th, the Vichy government, disagreeing with Laval's plan for Franco-German collaboration, dismissed him from his position as vice-premier and replaced him with Darlan. At the time, commentators generally praised Pétain's decisive action and saw that move as a glimmer of hope for Vichy's future. However, the various facts of the past half-year have proven that although Laval personally left office, his political line continues in Vichy and has been completed by Darlan. In every way, Darlan is precisely a successor to Laval.</p>
<p>The content of the agreement reached between Darlan and the Germans remains a mystery. Although Vichy's ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye, assured the U.S. last month that France would never hand over its navy or colonies to Germany or any other country, it is an undeniable fact that the Germans have already obtained various military advantages in Syria, at least to some extent. Darlan's lengthy speech to reporters in Paris on May 30th, in which he severely condemned Britain and declared Vichy's determination to participate in the "new order" in Europe, sufficiently proves that at a time when the Germans are urgently seeking to increase their strength to defeat Britain, the aid they demand from Vichy is unlikely to be withheld. After Weygand returned to France from North Africa, Vichy held two public cabinet meetings in one day on the 3rd. Their importance is said to be comparable to the meetings a year earlier to request an armistice with Germany, and it is rumored that they have decided to resist Britain in Syria and Tunis. A German spokesman also claimed that if France uses force to resist Britain's advance in Syria, it will receive Germany's full cooperation and support. This clearly means that Vichy France is again on the brink of a new war, facing its former ally under the "cooperation" of its historical enemy. If this war were to become a reality, it would truly be a tragic and painful spectacle!</p>
<p>At present, Vichy seems to have become a vassal of the Nazi "new order," but its actions are enough to influence the future international situation. The center of gravity in the Near East is not in Turkey, Egypt, or even Cyprus, but in Syria. If the German army gains a strong foothold in Syria, it will be in a better position to attack Suez, Turkey will be surrounded, and British defense of Cyprus will become extremely difficult. The situation in Dakar has also been closely watched by the United States and is seen as a factor that could drag the Americas into the whirlpool of war. At this point, not only are British warnings insufficient to influence Vichy's determination to cooperate with Germany, but even American appeasement has lost its effectiveness. Even if the aforementioned assurances made by Henry-Haye are indeed reliable, there are still many ways to "cooperate" with the Nazis in political and military terms, apart from formally handing over the navy and colonies to Germany, and some have already become facts. This situation can only be salvaged by resorting to force, and there is no other way. The British measures in Oran and Dakar last year may have been too hasty, but now is indeed the time for decisive action. The British withdrawal from the Balkans and Crete cannot be considered a major failure in overall strategy, but it has at least damaged British prestige and influenced the attitude of some neutral countries. That kind of Dunkirk-style retreat must not be repeated, and in this case in Syria, it is even more necessary to seize the initiative.</p>
<p>Although Vichy is occupied by elements who are generally anti-British and anti-democracy, it certainly does not represent the interests and demands of the vast majority of the French people. The tradition of "liberty, equality, fraternity," which has lasted for 170 years, does not seem to be replaced overnight by "work, family, and loyalty"! The Pétain regime did once gain the support of the French people, but what they sought was a "glorious peace," not the humiliation of an armistice; it was a painful recovery, not a long-term disguised enslavement under the bayonets of their historical enemy to build a so-called "new order," and certainly not to turn their weapons against Britain again after reluctantly laying them down. If the French people still have a strong will and spirit to fight, they must be comrades of de Gaulle, not disciples of Darlan. Although Syria is only a mandated territory and not worth defending by force, it must be purely for France, not for the Nazis. The various harsh demands of the armistice agreement can only be accepted passively. Even after Darlan's recent active negotiations, France has only been able to secure the release of 100,000 French prisoners and the opening of traffic between the occupied and free zones, but for Syria, which Germany demands militarily, it is willing to engage in war again. If this war is not led by the German army, it is believed that it will be difficult to achieve success. This will undoubtedly be more beneficial to Britain and the de Gaulle faction. Vichy's complete reliance on a very slim chance of Nazi victory has doomed it to a tragedy that was already inevitable when it chose surrender and peace, and it will only become more apparent and ultimately impossible to salvage.</p>
<h3>Dutch Foreign Minister Confers with the U.S. on the Defense of the Dutch East Indies; Japan's Demands for Oil Supply Are Excessive; Negotiations Are Making No Progress, and the Situation Is Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens yesterday has sparked speculation in the capital that close defense and concrete plans between the United States and the Netherlands in the South Pacific territories may be discussed soon. It is believed that Kleffens brought important information regarding the defense of that area after his inspection of the Dutch East Indies. The "New York Herald Tribune" commented yesterday on news that a dramatic change will occur in the negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies within these days, stating, "Any threat to the Dutch government's freedom of action cannot be ignored by the United States. This is already evident from the United States' provision of spiritual and material assistance to China." The newspaper said that Hull's guarantee to abolish special privileges in China after the restoration of peace implies that the United States intends Japan to be defeated in the war against China. The newspaper continued, "Effective assistance to China depends on transportation. The Dutch East Indies is conveniently located between us and Singapore, Rangoon, and the middle of China. If Japan relegates the Dutch East Indies to a subservient position like Vietnam or Siam, it will be a major blow to China and Britain. The Dutch East Indies should be assured that this will not happen." (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Batavia: The Japanese economic delegation hopes the Dutch will give a response within 24 hours, but the Dutch have reiterated that their views have not changed. As a result, the situation here is even more tense today. The Japanese have expressed dissatisfaction with what the Dutch are willing to give Japan and said that the matter may need to be transferred to the governments concerned, thereby eliminating the economic aspect of the issue. The Dutch fear that Japan will use its own resources obtained in the Dutch East Indies and supply Germany with extra rubber and tin obtained from Thailand and Vietnam. A Dutch spokesman said, "We are not sure that they will do so, but we cannot allow any goods to fall into enemy hands." It is believed that if the Dutch still refuse to agree to Japan's demands, the Japanese representatives will immediately reject the Dutch response. (United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens said yesterday that in his view, there is no conflict of interest between Japan and the United States seeking war materials from the Dutch East Indies. "Japan can obtain the materials we can extract within a reasonable range, because we are very reasonable. But we do not want any other country to occupy a dominant position within our territory. The current oil agreement with Japan is proceeding smoothly, and it was extended for another six months a few days ago. I do not believe that the Japanese are very satisfied, because it is really difficult to satisfy them." Kleffens met with President Roosevelt yesterday and, according to him, discussed many issues. However, the Dutch East Indies has not yet received any American goods under the Lend-Lease Act. This trip by Kleffens is a return trip from the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. It is said that the defense and morale of the Dutch East Indies are excellent. (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Batavia: Mr. Littman, head of the Information Bureau of the Dutch East Indies government, who recently visited Australia, gave a speech here yesterday on the relationship between Australia and the Netherlands, saying that there is a need for joint assistance. Both sides are trading countries, and it is not surprising to consider differences in the economic and social nature of the environment. Australia is now gradually aware of the development and importance of the Netherlands, and the interest of Australians in the visit of Dutch officials to Australia is a clear demonstration of Australia's attention to the Dutch East Indies. Relations between the two sides still need to be improved, and mutual understanding needs to be increased. Therefore, a plan to exchange information between the two sides is currently being prepared. He hopes that this move can promote a permanent relationship. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: After meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens yesterday, President Roosevelt also conferred with Supreme Court Justice Murphy. White House Secretary Early said that he asked the President whether he would ask Murphy to serve as the Governor-General of the Philippines. The President replied that he knew nothing about it. Well-informed sources speculate that the President is probably seeking Murphy's opinion on the issue of replacing the current Governor-General of the Philippines, Sayre, with a successor. (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Batavia: Perske, Far East correspondent for the Australian Associated Press, yesterday elaborated on the need for closer cooperation between Australia and the Dutch East Indies from an Australian perspective. After recounting the historical ties between the two countries, Perske said that Australians did not have a better understanding of the Dutch East Indies until last year, and were amazed at its war efforts. British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham recently stated that the defense line of the democratic countries in the southwestern Pacific extends from Singapore to Australia. Shortly after, the Dutch Foreign Minister also declared that the defense line starts from Burma, passes through Malaysia, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and reaches New Zealand. In his opinion, there are many things that Australia and the Dutch East Indies can mutually benefit from on the basis of cooperation. In short, what Australia can give to the Dutch East Indies is as follows: (1) Military assistance on land, sea, and air; (2) Heavy industrial products such as steel; (3) Several bases on the west coast of Australia for the Dutch navy and air force to expand patrols; (4) Extremely refined products; (5) Precision products currently lacking in the Dutch East Indies; (6) Food; (7) Armaments, including aircraft engines. The Dutch East Indies can supply Australia with the following: (1) A defense line of islands parallel to the Equator from Darwin to Singapore and another defense line passing through the Equator to Dutch New Guinea; (2) Continued use of islands between Darwin and Singapore that are necessary to maintain Imperial communications; (3) Strong economic assistance; (4) Substantial assistance from the merchant fleet; (5) Supply of high-grade aviation fuel and low-grade petroleum; (6) Fifty important air bases available for British military use; (7) A market for multiple products.

<h3>Reported Return of Winant to the Country Carrying Important News; Hull Refuses to Disclose the Content of the Report and Denies the British Prime Minister's Request for a Declaration of War</h3>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull gave the first official hint that Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant's arrival carries serious news regarding the overall situation of the British war effort. Hull refused to discuss the facts reported by Winant to the White House and the State Department, stating only that Ambassador Winant reported on the overall situation of diplomatic policy, as well as the related international naval and military situations, and the dangers faced by the United States, for a total of more than thirty minutes. When asked if Winant had carried a request from British Prime Minister Churchill asking the United States to declare war, Hull replied that Ambassador Winant had not made such a request. Winant was originally scheduled to go to the White House yesterday to confer with the President, but later went to New York on official business. (5th, Taiwan Public News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington - In Washington today, there is a desire to find an explanation for the return of the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Winant, to the United States. Therefore, unofficial circles in both Washington and London have criticized the recently widespread rumors of peace negotiations. Winant is now believed to be carrying an urgent appeal from Britain for help. Consequently, Washington experts are studying what the consequences would be if the United States could not increase its aid to Britain. Winant's most pressing task at present is to hold talks with officials of the Lend-Lease program. Therefore, the rumors that he is carrying news of peace negotiations or an offer related to Nazi leader Hess, who recently fled to Britain, are not widely believed. Winant will return to the White House today to continue reporting to President Roosevelt. Winant declared that he would stay here for several days to hold talks with President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of the Army Stimson, and Vice President Wallace. It has been sufficiently proven that Winant's return to the United States was voluntary and not in response to the President's call. The White House is now closely watching the Axis powers' attacks on Alexandria and the extension of the war to Asia Minor. The White House is also closely watching whether Britain might collapse. If Britain collapses, the British fleet will no longer be able to exist between the Western Hemisphere and Europe. It was learned yesterday that Winant had fully reported to President Roosevelt and the State Department on the course of Britain's war against Germany. (5th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington - Simms, the international editor of the U.S. Howard system newspaper, published a paper stating that U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant has reported to President Roosevelt, stating that it would be difficult for Britain to resist Germany independently until 1942. Although the details of the report are unknown, it is generally believed that Winant carried a "letter of appeal" from Churchill to Roosevelt, and others believe that Churchill has demanded that the United States immediately intervene in maritime affairs. Neutral observers believe that if the United States does not immediately provide assistance, Britain will enter into peace negotiations. (5th, Haitian News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant recently returned to the country to report on his duties. It is said that he carried a detailed report on Britain's war experience, including not only military affairs, but also the current British economic and food situation and social background. It is said that the Congress will transfer the supplies received during the war to the U.S. government, which will be of great military value for the preparation of national defense and the protection of democracy.

<h3>The United States Reiterates Its Non-Recognition of the Principle of Territorial Acquisition by Force; Undersecretary of State Welles Submits a Note to Southern Envoys Expressing This View</h3>
<p>Washington - The United States formally reiterated yesterday its determination to not recognize what Germany has gained by military conquest. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday submitted a note to the Yugoslav Minister Futijic in response to two notes from the minister, stating that the U.S. government and people are extremely angry about the invasion and dismemberment of Yugoslavia. It will never recognize the transfer of the national land and sovereignty, the same as not recognizing the land transfer of other countries. The U.S. government will continue to recognize Peter II as the legitimate monarch of Yugoslavia. It is found that the note of the South Minister is protesting Italy's unauthorized establishment of the new country of Croatia. (5th, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>US Ambassador Visits Pétain to Urge Announcement of French Policy; Vichy Officially Denies Saying Six Bases Provided for German Use</h3>
<p>Vichy - Head of State Pétain met today with U.S. Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy for a lengthy conversation to discuss the international situation. Cabinet Assistant Darlan was also present. (4th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>London - U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy visited Vichy Head of State Pétain yesterday, reportedly asking him to announce French policy. The Vichy government has issued an order for extremely strict scrutiny of news reports and information from Vichy related to French-German cooperation. When Pétain spoke yesterday about the new order he intends to implement in France, he did not mention Germany, Syria, or Tunisia. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. public opinion remains opposed to Vichy Vice Premier Darlan's pro-German policies. Therefore, any steps taken by Britain in Syria will certainly receive unanimous support from the United States. A Washington Post editorial used strong language, saying that if Darlan's words mean anything, France is not only willing to kiss the stick that strikes it, but will also use the stick to turn around and strike the country that could liberate it from its bonds. Hitler is an enemy that the United States has already declared. Since France wants to be Germany's friend, it can no longer be America's friend. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, London was rife with rumors of further cooperation plans between Vichy and Germany. Although officials have not yet confirmed it, it is of great concern because it shows the potential nature of French assistance. One theory is that according to the conditions set by Hitler and Darlan, six French naval bases will be jointly used by the French and German fleets. These six locations are: Port Said (French Mediterranean coast), Beirut (Syria), Villefranche (near Nice), Algiers, Casablanca, and Dakar. If this theory is true, it is extremely important. If Germany obtains Dakar, it can station ships at this base, which is extremely close to the distance between Africa and the South American continent, and will threaten British ships sailing from various ports in West Africa. However, the Vichy official news agency announced that the responsible party formally denied this theory. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington - Last night, it was learned from reliable sources that U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy asked General Pétain to clarify the true purpose and scope of French-German cooperation. It is said that Pétain's reply may greatly affect the diplomatic relations between the United States and France. If French-German cooperation expands, the United States may sever diplomatic relations with the Vichy government. (5th, Haitian News Agency)</p>
<h3>Germans Pouring into Syria; Egypt Bans Trade with the Country</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent reports from the Syrian border that Germans continue to pour into Syria from the sea, land, and air. Three express trains arrive in Syria every week, and fifty Germans disembark from each train. These people carry fake passports from various Balkan countries, disguised as Jewish refugees, carrying cheap suitcases with large characters written on them. Ships requisitioned by Germany arrive at Syrian ports at night, although not confirmed, it is believed that most of these ships arrive at the port of Latakia. Germans flying to various airfields in Syria are also arriving in an endless stream. According to recent news, more than twelve aircraft arrive in Syria every day, mostly fighter planes. On Tuesday, one hundred and fifty transport planes landed in Rayak, the purpose of which is unknown. It was also previously reported that a hospital ship arrived in Beirut recently, and 400 wounded soldiers disembarked. Although this theory has not been confirmed, it is believed that the so-called wounded soldiers are actually Nazi tank soldiers who have taken over French armored vehicles and tanks that have been idle for many months. At the same time, Vichy ordered that any French officers in Syria who escape to Palestine should be killed on the spot. It is said that on Tuesday, two officers who tried to escape were indeed killed. In addition, Vichy warned soldiers that if they tried to flee, their families would be punished and their property confiscated. According to someone who arrived in Palestine, most of the Senegalese troops stationed on the border are inclined to the British side. Therefore, for every hundred soldiers in this army, there are ten Vichy officers supervising and commanding them. These officers have received instructions that if British troops cross the border into Syria, they must open fire. After the Germans arrive in Syria, most of them immediately go to the interior. However, major hotels in Beirut are now reserved for German guests. These people can speak fluent French, but when filling out the hotel registration book, they reveal their nationality. Syrian French people secretly express their disgust at the entry of Germans, and the British suppression of the Iraqi rebellion, the British air force's attacks on Syrian airfields, and the escape of Colonel Grelco have all encouraged the Syrian French. The border area is now quite peaceful, and there are no signs of secret operations being carried out in Syria. The harvest has ripened, and Jews and Arabs are living peacefully and are busy harvesting. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin - The British rumored that many people resembling Aryans and with suspicious behavior have arrived in Syria, claiming to be Romanian Jews, etc. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman denied this news, saying that it was a habitual trick of the British to spread rumors. The French official in charge of Syrian affairs, Dengzi, has officially announced that the absence of German troops in Syria is clear evidence. (5th, Haitian News Agency)</p>
<p>Cairo - The Egyptian Ministry of Finance has classified Syria as a "German-Italian occupied territory" and banned trade with it. (5th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>British Naval, Land, and Air Forces Concentrating; the Stage of War Is About to Arrive</h3>
<p>London - According to news here today, Syria is now virtually surrounded by British forces. British troops, aircraft, and warships are preparing to take action, intending to launch an attack on this French mandate territory once it becomes a base for German operations. British Imperial forces in Mosul, Iraq, Urdun, and Palestine have all concentrated on the Syrian border, and large squadrons of warships are also anchored off the coast of Syria. As a result, Syria, except for the part bordering Turkey, is now completely surrounded by the Central Powers. Because British forces are ready to stand by for orders, it is generally felt here that this move by the British will not be delayed for long. This belief has now been announced by The Times, which said, "If the British wait until the German troops are properly deployed in the French colony before taking action, it may be too late." It also said, "Although the news of German troops landing in Syria has not yet been confirmed, in fact, this kind of German action may be launched in the next few days or hours. British troops in Egypt and Palestine are ready to take any useful steps to stop or prevent it." The Daily Express said that the arrival of General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French forces, at the port of Haifa in Palestine, "may indicate a decisive stage of the war is about to arrive. We must seize this important opportunity." Now that British forces have occupied Mosul, the troops of General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of British forces in the Middle East, have gained side protection and can engage in counteraction. The crisis point in Syria has clearly arrived. At present, the British are waiting to see how the Germans will act before sending troops into Syria. Judging from the Germans' actions, if they do not launch an invasion by transporting troops by plane from Crete, Rhodes, and the Dodecanese Islands, they will attack via Turkey. As for the latter, the British believe that Turkey will never grant the Germans' request to allow their troops to cross the border. In the area bordering Syria and Palestine, although Lieutenant General Wilson can launch a major offensive as soon as he receives orders, the forward troops of the British and French armies are still very friendly and respect each other with cigarettes. On the surface, the British forces are currently guarding against Arab smuggling, while the French are dealing with rebels. In this border area, there are sparsely populated areas, some of which are several miles wide and pass through the mountains. On the Syrian side, there are many fortifications. At night, the French army's searchlights frequently shine on this desolate area. People here speculate that General Wavell may also attempt to invade Syria by transporting troops by plane, considering the possibility that German troops may invade Syria by transporting troops by plane and in view of the fact that British troops used this method to occupy Mosul. Military sources here pointed out that the British army's use of airplanes to occupy Mosul was the second time. The first time the British army used this tactic was to invade southern Italy with paratroopers. The British army used Bristol Bombay transport planes to carry troops. This aircraft is a twin-engine monoplane that can carry 24 soldiers in addition to the four aircrew members. Its range is more than 2,000 miles. (5th, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Launches Fierce Assault on French Coast; British Industrial Areas Also Bombed; Five German Planes Invading Britain Shot Down</h3>
<p>London - Last night, British bombers, protected by fighter planes, flew out from the south coast and fiercely attacked French territory. The sound of explosions was incessant. After a while, these British aircraft crossed the British coast again and returned to defense. Yesterday afternoon, residents of Kent suddenly heard a loud explosion on the French coast, as the Central Air Force was attacking northern France. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - It is said that three German bombers were destroyed when they flew to Britain on Tuesday night for a small-scale attack. Last night, several German planes, using clouds as cover, attempted to cross the Kent coast. They were pursued by Spitfire British planes. Two of the latest Messerschmitt fighter planes were shot down in the Channel, and one British plane was also missing. It is found that this type of German fighter plane is the Me 109 F type, which is an improved version of last year's Me 109 model. Its main feature is that it has a larger engine. When German planes attempted to sneak into the interior, there were several fierce encounters with British planes. The public heard the sound of small cannons and machine guns, and before long they saw a German fighter plane with smoke coming from its tail, fleeing across the Channel. Last night, London issued an alert, and then heard gunfire. Yesterday afternoon, a city in northeastern Scotland was bombed, and several nearby areas were also strafed, with slight material damage and some people injured. A Spitfire British plane fought alone yesterday, shooting down a German dive bomber off the French coast, and strafing enemy observation posts and searchlight teams. It also flew low over a French city and attacked a motorboat before flying back through anti-aircraft fire. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - German planes again launched a fierce air raid on the industrial areas of West Midland on the morning of the 5th, as the area had experienced in recent weeks, dropping countless incendiary bombs mixed with high-explosive bombs.

It is expected that the cabinet reshuffle will be completed today, with the Prime Minister retaining his post. The Wafd Party still refuses to join the cabinet. This is purely a domestic political issue and has absolutely no connection with foreign affairs, as the Wafd Party and other parties disagree on the issue of wartime national elections. The idea of further expanding the government's base is currently welcomed by the general public here. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>French Military Observers Speculate on Future Offensive Targets of Germany and Italy: Eastward to Suez Canal, Westward to Gibraltar; Germany Denies Plans to Organize "United States of Europe"</h3>
<p>Vichy - Military observers here have recently speculated on the direction of future offensives by the Axis powers. They generally believe that the idea of Germany directly invading Britain is unlikely to materialize for the time being. Therefore, there are only two courses of action to follow in the future: one is to target the Suez Canal and attack the eastern Mediterranean, and the other is to target Gibraltar and attack the western Mediterranean. The two may be carried out simultaneously or in sequence. If they are successful one after the other, the Mediterranean will become an "inland lake" of Germany and Italy. However, if Germany and Italy want to do something in the western Mediterranean, they must first make diplomatic preparations, which does not seem to be considered at this time. In the eastern Mediterranean, the situation is clearer, as the Aegean Islands are already in the hands of the Axis powers. In the future, they may use paratroopers to advance on the Nile to attack Egypt, or use the air force to attack the British island of Cyprus. Comparing the two, the latter seems more difficult, as attacking Cyprus is no less difficult than the previous attack on Crete. This is because the defenses on the island are more substantial, and the island is closer to British air bases, making it easier for British aircraft to provide support in the event of an emergency. It is quite far from the Axis air bases, unlike Crete, which is very close. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Lyon - What military decisions were made during the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass? Political figures here remain silent. However, "The Times" recently commented, "At present, the eyes of the world are focused on the Suez Canal and Alexandria. The future actions of Germany and Italy may develop in this direction. However, German military actions have always aimed to win by surprise, so it is difficult to predict at this time. However, a review of the map shows that various military actions can be taken in the eastern Mediterranean. However, the last British base in that area is Cyprus. Regarding the political issues discussed at this meeting between the German and Italian leaders, it is possible that they have reached important conclusions to drive Britain out of the European continent and thoroughly exchange views on the construction of a new European order." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Diplomatic figures are paying close attention to the news that the Axis powers will focus on reorganizing Europe in the future. Since the end of the Battle of Crete, the Axis military operations in the Balkans have been completed. It was generally believed that Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass would have decided on the nature of future military actions. However, according to news received today, the main purpose of the talks between the German and Italian leaders is still mostly in the economic and diplomatic realms, as they believe that the time for realizing the so-called "Axis Africa" has arrived. Before the war, Europe had to import wheat, coal, iron, oil, cotton, and other goods from overseas every year. At the same time, European countries, on the one hand, never fully utilized their own resources due to the implementation of free economic policies, and on the other hand, they produced various substitutes in order to break free from foreign economic constraints. Now that France has decided to implement a European policy, if it can utilize its African colonies, it will certainly make a significant contribution to the European reorganization plan. However, in order to realize the connection between Europe and Africa, it is necessary to first have freedom of the seas. Therefore, under the current circumstances, the only way is to enable the European continent to be economically self-sufficient as soon as possible. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a report from the American news agency that Hitler will organize a "United States of Europe" next week, the external spokesperson here called it completely unfounded. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in Gibraltar; Over a Thousand Civilians Evacuated</h3>
<p>La Línea, Spain - The British transport ship "City of Hilter Mothil" was escorted by two destroyers yesterday, carrying 1,500 civilians evacuated from Gibraltar. It is reported that the British Navy and Air Force in Gibraltar have concentrated and conducted night defense exercises. It is reported that the British ship "Linon," two aircraft carriers, several cruisers, and many destroyers are now stationed in Gibraltar. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Parliamentarians to Demand Smaller War Cabinet, Conscription of Labor for Production, Removal of Ineffective Ministers</h3>
<p>London - Reuters parliamentary sources have learned that when Parliament reconvenes, the British military's withdrawal from Crete will be debated. British Prime Minister Churchill and Labor Party leader Attlee will both participate in the debate. The British military's withdrawal from Crete has concretized criticisms of the government in some quarters. The main points of these criticisms are: demand a smaller war cabinet and remove any minister whose effectiveness is slack without the slightest hesitation. Therefore, this debate will involve many aspects and demand that Britain use faster and newer methods to move towards the ultimate victory that the country is determined to achieve and to simplify the government itself and the organization controlling production. Other issues that will be raised include: (1) conscription of the entire industry, including labor; (2) focus on production, with everything based on production; (3) obtain machinery from overseas as much as possible, even if it reduces grain imports; (4) implement stricter and more comprehensive rationing of various items; (5) expand the domestic movement to produce food and other necessary supplies. What many parliamentarians are most concerned about is the issue of government organization and production, especially labor. The government has repeatedly refused to reduce the war cabinet, but in this debate, parliamentarians will do their best to demand the simplification of the wartime government. As for the conscription of labor, it is what the Labor Party is unwilling to do, so it has not been implemented for a long time. However, if labor and the entire industry are conscripted at the same time, then the criticisms of production methods heard at this week's Labor Party Congress can be regarded as the Labor Party also acknowledging that the labor problem must be handled fairly. Now all parties agree that the conscription of industry is a fair idea. Parliamentarians also demand that civil defense affairs, which are currently managed by six ministries, be managed by a single minister. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Avoid Repeating Recent Failures</h3>
<p>Canberra - Australian Prime Minister Menzies declared today that the Australian Federal Government is in constant contact with London regarding the lessons learned from the Middle East campaign. He also said that all possible steps will be taken to avoid repeating recent failures. All we can do is take the most active steps to strengthen our future position. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Sydney - Labor representative Besley at the War Conference said today that the British defeat in the Battle of Crete was a tragedy. He said, "It is tragic to think that our troops suffered greatly due to the lack of proper equipment and complete air force. Those who have the responsibility to give Australians the opportunity to fight wherever the war occurs should take this incident as their final lesson. The Australian government must ensure that the British government guarantees sufficient air force protection for Australian troops in the future. The War Conference will discuss the situation in Crete tomorrow. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to sources here, when the German army was clearing the remnants on Crete, it captured another 2,000 British soldiers, bringing the total number of British soldiers captured on the island to 10,000. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (61): A Comprehensive View of the Atlantic War</h3>
<p>The anti-aircraft guns on the other side of the river mouth fired. The shells were loaded into the gun barrel, the gun body rotated, searching for enemy aircraft. The rumbling sound was endless. The enemy aircraft struggled for a while, then swayed and fell.</p>
<p>The various battle conditions described above were performed five times in one night. It was not until four days later that an armored fishing boat brought back a part of the wreckage of the aircraft that the battle results were known.</p>
<p>The fish-belly white of dawn shone on a small coastal town. At that time, the tide was just right, and a team of fishing boats raised their sails. The small boats were suddenly very busy, and the winch began to move as the iron chain passed through it.</p>
<p>The fishing fleet set out to sea, just as before, but this time their target was a new type of fish. Their clothing was quite similar to naval uniforms. However, this "smart" uniform of the regular navy seemed not very comfortable on these reservists.</p>
<p>The fishing boats advanced through the waves outside the harbor. When they encountered floating mines resembling small submarines brushing against the side of the ship, they lowered the mine-sweeping cables. These fishing boats carried out mine-sweeping work on the designated sea area. These small boats patrolled the British coast every day, regardless of wind or rain, keeping the inland sea routes safe.</p>
<p>Sometimes the mine-sweeping cable suddenly got caught, and a black monster emerged from the water. The fishing boat behind immediately opened fire. With a thunderous sound, the sea water shot straight into the sky, and another threat to navigation was removed. Although this seems insignificant in the Atlantic War, it is ultimately a blow to the enemy.</p>
<p>Sometimes the small boats failed to sweep the mines and accidentally hit them, then the Navy Department would have to regretfully announce the loss of another mine-sweeping boat the next day.</p>
<p>The dangers encountered by the coastal patrol boats were not only below the surface of the sea. Sometimes a buzzing sound suddenly rose from the sky. A black group could be seen in the distance, indicating that German bombers had arrived in formation. One of them swayed slightly for a while, then rushed down. The machine gunners on the fishing boat stuck to their posts, waiting for the opportunity to open fire. When the dive bomber dropped to within fifty yards, they fired at its unprotected nose. The bomber suffered this fatal blow and could never soar through the air again. It crashed straight into the sea. With a loud bang, even the sails and masts were broken. It turned out that the boat and the aircraft were so close to each other.</p>
<p>When the fishing boats steered back into port, the channel had been temporarily cleared. But who knows whether there will still be no mines tomorrow morning? The German army may have been busy all night, repeating their old tricks, so the fishing boats had to spend the night in the harbor reluctantly and then go out to patrol again. These coastal "housewives" engaged in mine-sweeping work day after day. The British shipping industry is currently facing an unprecedented threat, and the damage caused by mines is by no means small. No matter how the British convoys change their routes, they must reach a port, and these ports have become the target of attacks.</p>
<p>The air raid alarm in a coastal town suddenly stopped, and the anti-aircraft guns immediately exploded under the enemy aircraft. The whole town was in darkness, and suddenly flares slowly descended to the ground. The sky was bright, and the machine guns roared, hoping to shoot it down. Then there was a long whistle in the air, followed by a loud bang. Suddenly, fires broke out everywhere, and the explosions were endless. A bomb hit the air raid shelter, and perhaps a hundred people died as a result.</p>
<p>This bombing seemed to focus on the residents of the harbor, not the harbor facilities. The target of the German aircraft seemed to be the men and women workers, not their factories.</p>
<p>However, the night air raids did not prevent the workers from going to work the next morning. In the shipyards and docks, the sound of riveting machines and cranes still did not stop. Because of the blackout, the workers could not work at night, so they tried to change it to daytime as much as possible. These people who went to the docks every day were also participating in the Atlantic War.</p>
<p>Although they had gone through a night of tension and terror, they still went to work the next day. They had to pass through the ruins of destroyed houses and churches, and the ruins of the only entertainment venue, the cinema.</p>
<p>Another scene was far from the actual battle. In an office in London, many people were buried in various charts and statistics. They carefully calculated and issued a notice a few hours later saying that the meat ration for next week had to be slightly reduced. A group of middle-aged women turned back in frustration in front of dozens of butcher shops on the island of Britain. Men who took on heavy wartime work returned home and sat down to eat some vegetarian food. Men and women who usually worked part-time in wartime work, such as fire watchmen, also had to reduce their consumption of tea. It turned out that the British people generally liked to drink tea, and the daily consumption was very large.</p>
<p>The menus in major hotels had marks next to some dish names, implying that guests could choose one of fish, meat, or eggs, but could not eat two flavors at the same time. In large and small restaurants – the chefs in large restaurants wore honorary ribbons, and the landladies in small restaurants also managed the purchasing of side dishes, and the sons worked as cooks and waiters – new experiments were also being made on food, using British-produced vegetables to entertain guests with novel cooking methods. If you were a welcome old customer in the shop, the landlady could tell him in a low voice that some meat had been specially left for him.</p>
<p>Hotel owners and customers, butchers and housewives were all participating in the Atlantic War in the same way.</p>
<p>The red sun was gradually setting, and the night enveloped the dim water surface. Solemn cruisers, reflecting the red light of the sky, appeared and disappeared on the horizon, patrolling back and forth, searching for enemy ships. The situation in the Naval Staff Office was always tense, listening to reports and moving the prototype ships on the huge map. At the air station, the mechanics loaded bombs onto the bomb racks, busily checking the engines, and the pilots leisurely finished their after-dinner coffee and strolled around.</p>
<p>These were all fighters in this war. However, the office workers who went home in the city to eat meals without meat, sugar, or butter were also participating in the battle in the same way. Far overseas in Canada, the work in the steel mills continued all night. The flames of the steel mills in Pittsburgh, USA, made the night scene unusually beautiful. A group of strong men were working hard and sweating there, but they did not know that they were also participating in the Atlantic War, no less than the lookouts on the battlefield.</p>

<h3>The Clouds of the Pacific are Worsening; Conflict Between the US and Japan is Inevitable; Both Sides are Approaching a "Showdown"; The Dutch East Indies Issue is Gradually Entering a Serious Stage</h3>
<p>A mainland newspaper editorial said that the threat of war in the Pacific region is approaching, and the effectiveness of the US opposition to Japan's expansionist policy is increasing. It is claimed that the United States will assist China in its war against Japan with 100 long-range bombers, along with American pilots and technicians. A spokesman for the Japanese cabinet's intelligence department declared that if the United States allows its aviators and mechanics to resign from the US Aviation Department to serve China, this action will be regarded as an unfriendly act.</p>
<p>Tokyo Chants Loud, Radical Remarks</p>
<p>It is claimed that the Japanese have solemnly declared that if the United States goes to war with Nazi Germany, Japan will inevitably clash with the United States. The semi-official Japanese newspaper Ko Chiho also declared that Japan has no choice but to aid Germany due to its obligations. At the same time, it asked the United States to pay attention to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's formal statement on this matter. Currently, the economic negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have not developed to Japan's satisfaction. Some Tokyo newspapers, in their editorials, demand that the Japanese government abandon its "undecided policy" and take severe steps, believing that the stubbornness of the Dutch East Indies is due to the support of Britain and the United States in the rear.</p>
<p>Enraged by US Aid to China</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Hull declared that after the restoration of peace, the United States will abandon its consular jurisdiction in China. This matter is also regarded as a blow to Japan, as this move further reflects Japan's policy of aggression, and Japanese newspapers even call Hull's letter to the new Foreign Minister of Chongqing, Guo Taiqi, merely a piece of paper. Japan believes that the United States is preventing its development in the Pacific region, and is enraged.</p>
<p>Predict Conflict is Inevitable</p>
<p>Washington is also aware of the increasingly tense situation in the Far East. The United States and Japan in the Pacific region are approaching a "showdown". We are not deliberately making alarmist remarks, but in view of the progress of all situations, it seems that open conflict is almost inevitable. Japan is trying its best to escape the difficulties that it has been trapped in by the warlords. The United States adheres to its traditional policy and is unwilling to compromise with unreliable people like the leaders of the Axis powers. The American people are even more unwilling to take actions that are contrary to their moral beliefs. Therefore, unless the Japanese government changes its attitude in the near future, the inevitability of a US-Japan conflict is almost certain.</p>
<h3>Slaughterhouse Rentals; Panic in the Slaughtering Industry; Business Was Already Plummeting; Further Control Will Leave Nothing Behind</h3>
<p>Shanghai's slaughtering industry, taking the pig slaughtering industry as an example, is divided into two types: the local gang and the Suzhou gang. The local gang is from Jiangyin Chongming, and the Suzhou gang is mostly from Wuxi Lai, residing in the Nanyang Bridge area of the French Concession and the North Chengdu Road area of the Public Concession. Before the war, including the pig slaughtering in the British and French Concessions and the Zhabei in the South City, there were no less than three or four hundred workshops. Each workshop hired three or four or more than ten apprentices. Slaughtering a pig only cost 40 cents to 70 cents from the meat dealer. All the pig bristles were shared by the workshop owner and the apprentices, and the pig blood belonged to the workshop owner. At least more than 3,000 pigs were slaughtered every day. The slaughtering masters made a lot of profit.</p>
<p>Profiting Handsomely</p>
<p>Since the war, it has been difficult to operate in Zhabei in the South City, and pig slaughtering is done exclusively in the British and French Concessions. There are private workshops in Caojiadu and Xujiahui. The slaughterhouse in the French Concession is the so-called fake cattle slaughtering company. For each pig, the company charges 50 cents, and the workshop charges 1 yuan and 30 cents for slaughtering. In addition, there is a meat dealer and a slaughtering association fee of 10 cents each. The Public Concession is located at the Xinninghai Slaughterhouse on North Chengdu Road. The Suzhou and Wuxi slaughterhouses slaughter pigs. Xinninghai is the local gang, charging 1 yuan, 11 cents and 5 points for the company fee per pig, 1 yuan and 20 cents for the slaughtering fee, and 20 cents for the meat dealer and the slaughtering association fee. The Suzhou and Wuxi slaughterhouses are run by the meat dealers themselves. They hire apprentices to slaughter pigs and do not need the pig slaughtering workshops to slaughter them.</p>
<p>Continuing to This Day</p>
<p>With a long history, no less than tens of thousands of people rely on pig slaughtering for a living. Since the source of live pigs has been controlled by a certain party, and the production in Jiangbei is very low, it is not cost-effective for farmers to raise pigs because of the high price of food. As a result, the entire Shanghai has only more than 1,000 pigs per day, which is not enough for distribution. It is not easy for meat dealers to get a pig. There are also many slaughterers who cannot get a pig to slaughter every day. The industry has plummeted, and the price of meat has soared. Unexpectedly, the news came that the pig slaughtering industry must also be controlled, and the slaughterhouse of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) will be rented. In the future, the pigs in both Concessions will not be slaughtered by pig slaughterers. The industry is related to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. The meat industry and the pig slaughtering association jointly resolutely oppose it, and they are running around and appealing to all parties to cancel it. It has been half a month, and there are no concrete results. Today, it is heard that the工部局's slaughterhouse has decided to rent it out. The slaughtering industry has a great impact.</p>
<p>Great Impact</p>
<p>It has appealed to all sectors, requesting assistance, and in order to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people, representatives were immediately dispatched to visit the responsible authorities of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council), saying that in order to protect their legal operations and to remember the impact on society if thousands of colleagues in the city are unemployed as a result of this move, the lease contract should not be signed, so that the Suzhou merchants can get out of their difficulties and save their lives.</p>
<h3>New Restrictions on British Residents Going to Japan; Must Have Consent of Japanese Foreign Ministry Before Passport Can Be Issued</h3>
<p>According to news released by the Japanese Consulate General here yesterday, all British people who are going to Japan in the future and who apply to the Japanese Consulate for passport re-endorsement must obtain the consent of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo before they can be approved. When the reporter inquired about this with the British Consulate General, a senior official said that they were not aware of this matter, so they were unwilling to comment on it. According to well-informed diplomatic sources, the new restrictions imposed by Japan on British residents are enough to prove that British-Japanese relations are becoming more tense.</p>
<h3>Coolidge Ship Commandeered: Last Voyage Departs Shanghai Yesterday for Hong Kong and Manila, Clifford Expected to Arrive Next Week</h3>
<p>The splendid passenger ship, President Coolidge, of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 4th, entered the Huangpu River, and brought several key American businessmen to the city. This visit of the President Coolidge to Shanghai may be its last during the current emergency, as the ship has been purchased by the U.S. government to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>Departed Yesterday for Manila</p>
<p>The ship arrived in Shanghai from Honolulu via Japan. It was scheduled to set sail from Shanghai yesterday at 5:30 PM for Hong Kong and Luzon. In addition to the 287 passengers who came from the U.S. on the original ship bound for Southeast Asia, more than 119 people from Shanghai also boarded the ship to Hong Kong and Luzon.</p>
<p>Return Trip to the US Will Berth at Kobe</p>
<p>An official of the President Lines stated yesterday morning that the President Coolidge will stop at Kobe on its return trip to the US.  Departing from the US en route from Honolulu to Shanghai, it will not stop in Japan according to the newly established schedule. However, World Class ships will still berth at various ports in Japan on their way from the US.</p>
<p>Ten Military Officers Will Go to Beiping Immediately</p>
<p>Among the American businessmen who arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge were Mr. Ke Wei, manager of the Shanghai Ford Motor Company, Mr. Stein, manager of the Shanghai branch of American President Lines, and Mr. Legas, manager of the Shanghai branch of American Express Bank. Ten U.S. Marine Corps officers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Yasusde, will go to Beiping. It is heard that Mr. Ya will go to Beiping to serve as the commander of the U.S. forces there. From 1930 to 1933, Mr. Ya was stationed in Shanghai. Nine officers, including Major Cen Sen, accompanied him on this trip.</p>
<p>Clifford Ship's Arrival in Shanghai Postponed</p>
<p>The President Clifford, on its return trip from Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai and back to the U.S., was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th). According to the company's announcement, it will be postponed until next Wednesday (the 11th) to arrive in port and will leave Shanghai for the U.S. on the 12th.</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That the Jackson Has Been Commandeered</p>
<p>The new World Class passenger ship President Jackson, on its first circumnavigation, should arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 9th) according to the scheduled voyage, and depart from Shanghai for Southeast Asian ports on the 10th to circumnavigate back to the US. It was previously rumored that the ship had been commandeered by the U.S. government. The Shanghai branch of the President Lines has not received any notification from the head office, so the reservation of berths is still being processed as usual. However, as of this order, there is no telegram indicating whether the ship will arrive in Shanghai on schedule.</p>
<h3>Authorities Gradually Tighten Controls; Rice Merchants Gradually Restricted; Newly Ordered Hong Kong Rice and Saigon Rice Expected to Arrive Within the Month</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling affordable low-grade rice, sales of rice handled by private businesses have become scarce. Inland dealers rarely purchase, and most local businesses are paying attention to the affordable low-grade rice, creating a situation where supply greatly exceeds demand. Recently, foreign firms have received telegrams from Yangon and Siam offering to sell low-grade and No. 2 Siamese rice. Although they have tried to lower the prices as much as possible, no one is interested. If foreign rice continues to pour in, the market price of rice will further decline. Therefore, legitimate rice merchants will now handle the Shanghai Municipal Council's affordable low-grade rice to seek legitimate profits and avoid unexpected losses.</p>
<p>Reporting Required for Rice Sales in the Extraterritorial Areas</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person in charge of the Public Concession of the Shanghai Municipal Council told reporters that rice shops in the extraterritorial road areas must, starting today, collect a reporting booklet from the Xiangmao Foreign Firm at No. 1 The Bund and report the quantity of foreign rice sold by the Shanghai Municipal Council each day and the addresses of the buyers. After each rice shop fills it out, they should submit it to the police station in charge of the area for the authorities to check. Failure to comply with the above procedures will result in the cancellation of their right to sell.</p>
<p>Second Batch of 10,000 Tons of Hong Kong Rice Ordered</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling affordable Hong Kong rice, the first batch has long been sold out. The second batch will begin to be sold within the week, and various grain stores continue to place orders enthusiastically. It is reported that yesterday alone, the quantity ordered from Xiangmao Foreign Firm reached more than 2,000 tons, totaling about 10,000 tons including previous orders. The number of foreign firms fixing rice has increased from twelve to sixteen. The Shanghai Municipal Council has informed the Hong Kong government of the quantity ordered by each rice shop and requested that ships be dispatched to Shanghai as soon as possible. It is heard that it will arrive in Shanghai before the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Affordable Saigon Rice to Be Loaded This Month</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai French Concession's Board of Directors contacting the Vietnamese government to directly order No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon mixed broken rice to be shipped to Shanghai for affordable sale, the French authorities previously consulted with the Shanghai rice industry several times to act as distributors and stipulated that the profit for the rice merchants should be (1) 8% for the rice shops and (2) 5% for the rice retailers. All transactions by foreign firms must be registered by the French authorities. It is learned that French firm Dafu and British firm Heyi have successively concluded transactions totaling about 1,000 tons. According to the person in charge of each foreign firm, the affordable Saigon rice that has already been transacted can be loaded from the producing areas this month and is expected to arrive in port and be resold by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Registration Required to Sell Hong Kong Rice</p>
<p>Since the distribution of the second batch of affordable low-grade rice, various retail rice shops in the city have purchased from twelve grain stores such as Ruichangfa. However, a small number of rice shops have not filled out the "Application Form for Selling Foreign Rice of the Shanghai Municipal Council" and registered with the Liji Foreign Firm in the past. The foreign rice agency will not approve their purchase for the time being. From now on, retail rice shops wishing to sell the Shanghai Municipal Council's affordable low-grade rice should quickly fill out the "Application Form for Selling Foreign Rice of the Shanghai Municipal Council" and submit it to the grain store from which they purchased the rice, filling out a triplicate form at the same time, and submit it to Liji or Xiangmao Foreign Firm for review and approval before they can sell it.</p>
<p>Market Brokers Feel Very Embarrassed</p>
<p>The more than 200 brokers in the rice market rely on commissions from transactions between buyers and sellers for their daily income, with the larger ones earning two or three hundred yuan and the smaller ones earning fifty or sixty yuan. Their monthly income is quite considerable, but since affordable low-grade rice has continuously arrived in Shanghai, market transactions have suddenly decreased. The past two days have been very slow, so the general brokers cannot use their usual skills, and the situation is very embarrassing. They cannot help but feel the difference between the past and the present.</p>
<h3>Staff of Commercial Press Seek Salary: Executives of Management Refuse to Meet; Wang Yaotang Withdraws Involvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, representatives of the Commercial Press went to the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the law office of Wang Yaotang to hear back. Mr. Wang stated that the situation of the labor side was indeed pitiable and that he expressed his sympathy. The attitude of the management was stubborn and they refused to meet, making it impossible to start mediation. He has decided to withdraw from the matter and not get involved. An official of the Industrial Section said that he hoped that the representatives would submit specific opinions on Notice No. 372 for transfer to the management, which might allow the Industrial Section to conduct individual negotiations as an intermediary. The representatives believed that the future was still very bleak. In addition, the salary for the second half of May has not been issued. They decided to lead more than 100 laid-off employees to petition the homes of Manager Bao Qinglin and Hong Kong-based Commissioner Li Bojia. Although there were many people, the order was exceptionally good and there was no loss whatsoever. Manager Bao refused to meet, and his wife received them. At about 4 PM, the police sent a large number of detectives to drive the crowd away from Bao's house. They could not enter Li Bojia's house, so the colleagues had to return in the rain.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Mi Feng Factory Clash with Police; Western and Japanese Police Officers Injured; Three Workers Seriously Injured in the Head</h3>
<p>At 5:30 AM yesterday (the 4th), a labor strike riot occurred at the Mi Feng Woolen Mill at No. 400 Poyang Road in East Shanghai. Mr. Ma Lixun, a Western probationary patrolman of the Yangshupu Police Station, and a Japanese police officer of the Police Station were injured. After the labor strike occurred at the factory, at 5:30 PM that afternoon, all the workers were refused entry into the factory and gathered on the roadside. The workers demanded that the factory issue wages, but they were rejected by the factory. All the male and female workers, numbering about 100, clashed with the management. After receiving the report, the Yangshupu Police Station quickly dispatched police officers to suppress the riot and disperse the crowd of workers. At that time, the workers did not obey, and the police arrested eight workers with batons and took them back for interrogation. During the mutual fighting, Western patrolman Ma Lixun was hit in the forehead and knees and was sent to the hospital for treatment. The Japanese police officer was also slightly injured, and three workers were seriously injured in the head and were immediately sent to the police hospital for treatment. It will be difficult to discharge them for the time being.</p>
<h3>Bank Director and University Staff Abducted One After Another: Zhang Bokou Kidnapped on Avenue Albert, Shi Zhaokang Abducted by Three Russians</h3>
<p>In the past two days, two kidnapping cases have occurred in the city. One of the kidnapped was Zhang Bokou, director of the Yanye Bank, and the other was Shi Zhaokang, registrar of St. John's University. Both of them have disappeared after being kidnapped. The details of the valleys are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>Salt Industry Director Abducted Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, Zhang Bokou, chief auditor of the Yanye Bank, was kidnapped along with his car. The stolen car was soon discovered, but Zhang's whereabouts are unknown. The details of the kidnapping case are recorded below.</p>
<p>Serving for Many Years</p>
<p>Zhang Bokou, a Henan native, is 44 years old and resides in a foreign house at No. 16, Peifuli, No. 168, Avenue Albert, French Concession, Shanghai. Zhang has served as a director and chief auditor of the Yanye Bank at No. 280 Beijing Road in the city for many years. Although Zhang usually travels in a black-plated car with number 6010, the car is a public car of the bank for Zhang to ride in, rather than a privately owned one.</p>
<p>Suddenly Encountered Kidnappers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Zhang had a friend from his hometown, Mr. Lu, who arrived in Shanghai by boat from Beiping. Zhang ate breakfast at about 8:00 AM and went out to board the car, intending to go to the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to meet Mr. Lu first, and then go to the office. Unexpectedly, just as the car left the alleyway, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and stopped the car. Each took out a gun, jumped into the car, and drove the driver, Kong Qinghe from Yangzhou, out of the car.</p>
<p>Car Found</p>
<p>The car was driven away by the kidnappers, and the kidnapping disappeared without a trace. The driver, Kong Qinghe, saw that the kidnappers had left, so he reported the information to Zhang's family and then reported it to the French police. After sending detectives to investigate, they strictly ordered their subordinates to pay attention to the investigation. It was not until 10:45 AM that the police found the car with that number at No. 508 Julai Road and immediately notified the driver, Kong Qinghe, to go and claim it, but Zhang was still missing.</p>
<p>University Staff Abducted</p>
<p>Shi Zhaokang, registrar of St. John's University, 37 years old, left the school building at No. 188 Jessfield Road at 9:15 AM the day before yesterday and hired a rickshaw to return to his residence on Kangnuo Road. While passing through Caojiadu, a car suddenly chased after him.</p>
<p>Handcuffed</p>
<p>Three Russians and two Chinese men jumped out of the car, all with guns, and forcibly dragged Shi off the car, handcuffed him, and then pushed him into the car and drove away along Jessfield Road. The car's license plate number has not been disclosed. After St. John's University moved back to its original site in Zhaofeng Park a year ago, Shi and several other staff members were the first to return to the school.</p>
<p>Political Motivation</p>
<p>This kidnapping is likely politically motivated, and the fact that there are three Russians in the bandit gang is rare in kidnapping cases in Shanghai. The Shanghai West Special Police is currently investigating the case and providing special protection to other staff members of St. John's University. However, no suspects have been arrested as of yesterday. Many people in the city's education circles know Mr. Shi and were shocked to hear the news.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fall Daily; Shoe Industry Reduces Wages; The First Wage Reduction Since the Labor Strike</h3>
<p>The labor and management of the local footwear industry had a dispute in April of this year due to the labor side's demand for increased wages. The labor strike was deadlocked for a month, and then it was partially resolved by both sides, with a uniform increase of 30% in wages. At that time, both sides signed a treaty stating that when the price of rice fell, the increased portion would be reduced at any time. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been operating Hong Kong rice to maintain the people's food supply, and the price of rice has been declining daily. The wages in the industry have been reduced by 20% in proportion starting this month.</p>
<h3>Advertising on the Back of Rickshaws; Public Concession Approved, French Concession Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The plan to use the back of public rickshaws for advertising has been approved by the Public Concession of Shanghai Municipal Council, but there are still difficulties. It is heard that the French Concession Public Car Bureau does not allow rickshaws within the concession to carry such advertising. Since rickshaws in the Public Concession can travel in the French Concession, if the back of the car is used for advertising, the car will not be allowed to enter the French Concession, so whether this plan can be realized is still a problem. The relevant parties may consult with the French Concession Public Works Bureau again and see that since the Shanghai Municipal Council has already approved it, the general public believes that the French Concession Public Works Bureau may revoke this ban. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it intends to collect a special tax of one yuan per month for rickshaws carrying such advertising, and paper advertising products may not be used, and all advertising products must first be approved by the Police Department.</p>

<h3>Airmail Routes to the Americas and Europe: European Mail Carried by American Aircraft Is the Fastest; Entire Journey from Hong Kong Takes Only Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, the number of ships has decreased and the entrances to various coastal ports have been blockaded. Mail to various European countries is no longer routed through the Suez Canal. For safety, the post office has changed the route to the Pacific, taking the route through the United States and across the Atlantic to various European countries. Therefore, for the sake of speed, foreign merchants in the city send mail to the above-mentioned regions by air, carried by American Clipper aircraft. According to inquiries with the post office, the routes and fares for airmail to the Americas, Europe, the Near East, Malaya, British Singapore, and French Annam are as follows:</p>
<p>Asia</p>
<p>Airmail to Asia, such as Indochina, Hanoi, Saigon, Siam, and Bangkok, is now carried by Japanese Thai aircraft after British and French aircraft suspended operations after the European war. The route is from Guangzhou (Shanghai to Guangzhou by ship) connecting to Saigon, Hanoi, and Bangkok. The Shanghai Post Office closes at 8 PM on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and the Guangzhou aircraft depart every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday and can arrive on the same day. The postage is 5 jiao for every 20 centimeters, and the airmail fee is 6 jiao for every 5 centimeters to Hanoi and Saigon and 8 jiao for every 5 centimeters to Bangkok. Registration is an additional 5 jiao. If shipping from Shanghai to Guangzhou is required, the airmail fee is only 4 jiao for every 20 centimeters. For mail to Yangon, Calcutta, Surabaya, Batavia, or Bandung, Iraq, and Baghdad, the airmail fee is 1 yuan and 3 jiao per 5 centimeters. However, it can also be transferred from Hong Kong by Chinese aircraft via Chongqing to Yangon, Singapore, with an additional airmail fee of 2 jiao and 5 fen per 5 centimeters. Because mail to the above-mentioned areas is carried by British overseas aircraft departing from Singapore and Chinese aircraft departing from Hong Kong, it is faster. The airmail fee to Singapore has been reduced to 4 jiao and 5 fen per 5 centimeters.</p>
<p>Europe</p>
<p>In the past, European mail was carried by British Royal Line and French Central Line. The British Royal Line has now been renamed Overseas Line, and the departure point, originally Hong Kong, has been changed to Singapore. The mail is shipped by ship from Shanghai to Singapore for transfer. The post office has no fixed closing time and must wait for the ship schedule. However, the post office has separate notices posted at each post office. French aircraft have long been suspended. In addition to British aircraft flying to various parts of Asia and New Zealand, Sydney, and the islands of Ellice, New Guinea, and Samoa in Australia, if mail is shipped to Europe by British overseas aircraft, it can now only be shipped to Durban in South Africa. This is the airmail hub and the central hub for transshipment. Other parts of Africa such as the Union of South Africa, the Gold Coast, and Nigeria can also be mailed, with an airmail fee of 2 yuan and 4 jiao per centimeter. All European mail can be transferred via the overland route from Durban. As for the Philippines, Egypt, and Sudan, the airmail fee is still 1 yuan and 3 jiao per 5 centimeters.</p>
<p>Americas</p>
<p>Mail to the Americas is now carried by Chinese Clipper aircraft departing from Hong Kong. Except for South and Central America, for mail within the United States (U.S.A.), the airmail fee is 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen per 5 centimeters. For mail to England, France, Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, and other European countries, it can also be carried by American aircraft to San Francisco, where it is connected to transatlantic aircraft. The airmail fee is 5 yuan and 4 jiao per 5 centimeters, and the entire journey can be reached in just two days. As for mail to the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii, it is still carried by American aircraft, and the airmail fee is specified separately. The post office first ships mail to the above-mentioned areas to Hong Kong by the fastest ship, where it connects with the Clipper aircraft departing from Hong Kong. The closing time is also notified separately in notices posted at each post office and is not fixed, as it sometimes has to wait for the nearest ship.</p>

<p>Stolen Gold Ring</p>
<p>At the Yuan Da Coal Ball Store at No. 33 Alabaster Road, five robbers broke in around 7:15 PM last night. One robber displayed a handgun, threatening and intimidating.

<h3>Grains Foreign Rice Rises Then Quickly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was tight then weak. At the opening of the morning market, village customers took advantage of the low prices to continue buying, and speculators also absorbed a lot. Therefore, sellers raised their prices again. No. 1 Saigon was once offered at 120 yuan, and Small Jiaobai at 115 yuan. However, the Public Works Department continued to release government-sold rice, and large quantities of goods were about to arrive, so people were less anxious. Once the price was raised, sales slowed down again. At the same time, large dealers, seeing no hope for the future of the rice market, also continued to sell off their stocks, so the situation turned weak and trading was sparse. Limited transactions were made in various grades, and the market went downhill all the way until closing, without any rebound. The final settlement prices were: No. 1 Saigon at 118 yuan, 117.5 yuan, No. 114.5 yuan, Min Dang 115-116 yuan, Small Grain 111-112 yuan, Broken Rice 90 yuan, 87.5 yuan. Small Jiao had a new transaction at 123 yuan, with 500 tons offered. Yinghua Company's stockpile of broken rice was well received, with May reaching 104.5 yuan, later down to 102.5 yuan, which was still better than the previous day. Small Jiao spot goods 116.5 yuan to 136 yuan, goods en route 135 yuan, June 115.5 yuan, also leveled off. Total spot transactions for the day were no less than 14,000 to 15,000 bags, and Yinghua Company had nearly 1,000 tons, it is said.</p>
<p>Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Shipped to Tianjin: Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng ship, loaded with 17,677 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, is scheduled to transport it to Tianjin tomorrow. A large amount of Burmese foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<p>Thick and Thin Japonica Rice, etc.: Sales of thick japonica rice remained sluggish, and the market continued to be soft. Early and late rice were well-received, showing no signs of price changes. Kunshan white japonica rice was offered at 130 yuan, 128 yuan. Su Yuan bag at 128 yuan. South Port early and late rice remained as high as 127 yuan, finally settling at 132 yuan, original bag unopened.</p>
<p>Sales of glutinous rice in small quantities were slightly more than before, while market supply was very scarce, and prices increased. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 113 yuan, then down to 110 yuan. Glutinous tea 105 yuan, 103 yuan. National glutinous rice 121 yuan, then down to 117 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Gloomy</h3>
<p>The foreign flour market remained sluggish. Trading was sparse in the morning. Only Australian flour with the Flower and Bird brand had some sales in the local market, priced at 29.2 yuan. Bank-owned warehouses did not open. Jinlong flour was offered at 28.4-28.5 yuan, while buyers were only offering 28 yuan, and buying and selling were mutually exclusive. It was heard that 500 bags were traded in the aftermarket for only 28.1-28.2 yuan. Fort flour at 29 yuan still lacked transactions. The market is feared to fluctuate for a time.</p>
<p>The wheat market was easy, but there was still no development. It was found that there were still a small number of old wheat stocks in the Shanghai Concession. Holders, in view of the low flour prices, are waiting for the new wheat to be listed before selling. At present, new wheat is entering the market in the interior, but it has yet to arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains New Broad Beans Lack Vitality</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the broad bean market has been sluggish because sales from Hong Kong and the local market (local retailers mostly transport and sell themselves) have not kept up. Only Nanyang Quanzhou, etc., have inquired, and purchasing has also slowed down. Therefore, the market atmosphere suddenly became sluggish. Yesterday, the market was down by eight jiao from its peak. More than 200 bags of North Port green skin were offered at 42 yuan. Soybeans and corn continued to fall by five to six jiao, and the overall trend remained lifeless. A total of about 2,000 bags of various beans were traded, and more than 2,000 bags of corn were traded.</p>
<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Experiences Minor Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed exchange rates unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates was stable with a slight loosening. After the morning opening, Chinese banks came to sell, and speculators rushed to take profits, causing the July U.S. dollar to harden to 5.40625. Difficult to close. The US dollar once returned to par due to the intake by a foreign bank. At noon, it was heard that the British exchange rate had loosened to three pence, three and one twenty fifths, so the future U.S. dollar hardened again. In the afternoon, the British bank suddenly came in to absorb profits, and speculators stopped selling and rushed to cover their positions, causing the distant month U.S. dollar to return from loose to par, with the final central gold squeeze at 0.015625. The U.S. dollar was level, and trading was quite lively throughout the day.</p>
<p>Speculators Return to Sell</p>
<p>Since this morning's foreign telegraph silver market, both British and American prices have been level. Indian silver continued to rise, and exchange rates of various countries against the U.S. dollar fell by two and a half, and against Shanghai rose by three points. The exchange rate of British pound against Shanghai fell by 0.03125. Other rates remained unchanged. The central listing of various exchange rates was unchanged.

Chinese banks initially offered the June U.S. dollar at 5.40625 yuan at a certain American bank. Speculators also had intentions to sell, causing the July term to harden to the quoted price for closing. HSBC's listed exchange rates were unchanged. After the balance tax on silver was still levied at 24.25%, the situation was stable. Around 10 o'clock, foreign banks had better appetite for intake, which seemed to soften. Chinese speculators released the July rate of 5.40625, and it was heard that foreign banks were trading the June British rate at three pence and three, with five trending firmer. At noon closing, the British rate was three pence, three and one twenty-fifth, and the U.S. dollar for July was 5.40625, while the spot and June rate were 5.375.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Rebound in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a red-hot black market that continued to decline and then rebounded, due to the loosening and return to par of foreign exchange. People remained idle, not taking into consideration the European and American situations. On the day, foreign exchange dealers first appeared, then sold short, but securities firms, bank firms, jewelry shops, money exchange shops, and cash shops bought in succession, rising from 6,418 yuan to the evening closing of 6,450 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Transactions totaled several tens of thousands of taels. Cash saw a lower price due to squeezing, and trading was also thin. Tianyuan bought 20 taels from Wanfeng, and Chengji bought 50 taels from Yongfengyu, both priced 300 yuan higher than the forward price. In the afternoon, Fei Wenyuan sold 50 taels to Shihe at a price 185 yuan higher, a small squeeze compared to the previous day. Jewelry and customs gold remained level.</p>
<p>The morning market reported a soft U.S. dollar, and people were leaning downward. The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,420 yuan, 16 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Yuxingyong sold down to 6,418 yuan, while Defu, Gongda, and Hengji came in to buy, and the U.S. dollar rebounded slightly, with the price rising to around 6,430 yuan, remaining stable for a long time. With the U.S. dollar softening, the price rose to 6,440 yuan, sold by Xinfengyong and Dafengyiyuan. At noon, it fell to 6,428 yuan, with Defu buying in, so the noon closing was 6,433 yuan. The afternoon opening at 2:00 PM was immediately higher by 2 yuan, at 6,435 yuan. Xinfengyong and small investors sold down to 6,428 yuan. Suddenly, distant-month U.S. dollars were reported tight, and Shihe, Decheng, Yiyuan, and Gongda came in succession, and the price jumped up by more than 20 yuan, reaching 6,450 yuan, sold by the Xinfengyong bank and small investors. They retreated to 6,443 yuan. The 3:30 PM closing was 6,446 yuan, up 10 yuan from the previous day. The price of 6,479 yuan was quoted for the June U.S. dollar at 5.375, a difference of 33 yuan.

Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets both trended softer, with the former retreating to 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen, and the latter falling to 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 4 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for current exchange of notes was implicitly cancelled, and both parties balanced each other out. The interest rate for interbank lending remained unchanged. The money industry association's interest rates remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon markets both opened at seven points.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Bonds Receive Goods with Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, advancing slowly. Various groups received goods, continuing to buy without retreating, with great enthusiasm. After the Public Works Department stabilized rice prices, speculators gradually became discouraged and slowly released their stocks. The prices of various goods also fell with it. Foreign stocks saw a negative news, and speculators lost interest. As for gold and cotton yarn, they have already switched to trading futures. On the one hand, cash increased, and on the other hand, there were fewer outlets, so there was a surplus of funds, which was more severe than before. It was timely that the public bond environment became more abundant, so investors in public bonds became more prosperous. Yesterday morning, Xinfu, Defu, and Lianyi bought in, while Xiekang, Tongkang, and Shengchang sold out. Trading was not much, and market prices rose slightly by 5 fen and 1 jiao. Trading was brisk in the afternoon. Yuxing, Hongda, and Da entered with strong appetites, and Hengkang, Runde, and Lianyi also had a lot of demand. Others such as Dahua and Yitai also had considerable demand. Tongkang and Jiufeng released some stocks, while Xiekang, Shengsheng, Dada, Dalianhe all sold out. Transactions were mostly concentrated on Type C bonds, causing them to not rise much. Other types were then raised by two or three. About 270 to 280 million yuan were traded. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 90 shares of Coal Industry Bank shares were traded, at a 55% discount, excluding profits. Another 300 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company shares were traded at a price of 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The public trading hall's stock market continued to be clear and scarce. Among public utilities, only Wharf surged to 95 yuan, closing at 94.5 yuan, rising by one yuan, while the rest only fluctuated by five fen to one jiao. Rubber stocks were particularly stagnant.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Waits for Opportunities, Futures Yarn Made All Day</h3>
<p>The yarn market was soft with some firmness, but the momentum on all sides was very strong. This was because the wills of both the bulls and the bears differed. The bulls said that sales had recently improved, the factories were collecting purchase orders, and the shipment of spot goods to other ports continued uninterrupted, with a optimistic mindset. The bears said that the large amount of foreign goods had already been released, and the squeezing out of shorts was more difficult when futures were opened. Therefore, both sides held their positions and mostly watched, waiting for an opportunity to determine the outcome. The high price of 20s Shuangma was 1,428 yuan, and the low price was 1,411 yuan. The afternoon opening continued to be soft following the morning's sluggishness, priced at 1,421 yuan. Then, with the rise in standard gold, people's hearts turned upward, and the market rose to 1,435 yuan, with the final price at 1,424 yuan, and some were looking to buy.</p>
<p>Shuangma's morning opening was peaceful and dispersed. The first lot was priced at 1,428 yuan. Once this lot was opened, there were more sellers and fewer buyers on the table, and it gradually fell to 1,421 yuan. However, as the price loosened, those making profits moved to cover their positions, and the market returned to rise a step. It hovered between 1,433 and 1,434 yuan for quite a while. Later, it rose again to 1,427 yuan, and shorts sold again, loosening back to 1,413 and 1,414 yuan at closing. It was found that the statistics for trading in half a day were 5,440 bales. The amount of purchases made by various groups is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same industry 5,100 Hong Kong 340</p>
<p>Total 5,440</p>
<p>The standard gold transform horse futures market has been open since the 2nd of this month. The market previously had only morning trade, and since the 5th, they have switched to trading all day, separated into morning and afternoon markets. The trading volume in the morning market was 1.3 thousand bales, while trading in the afternoon was more lively and active with a total of 40 bales. The whole day’s trading volume was roughly 6.7 thousand bales. The opening prices for double horse in the morning and afternoon markets are listed below:</p>
<p>Morning Market Afternoon Market</p>
<p>July Open 1,363 1,364 Closed 1,370 1,376</p>
<p>August Open 1,375 1,383 Closed 1,381 1,389</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Situation is Stable</h3>
<p>The situation for spot cotton remained roughly weak and finely uneven, and the situation was stable. Although factory demand was not strong, foreign cotton prices did not loosen, and the source was difficult, and handlers were generally in an extremely high spirits. A total of 700 bales and 200 packages of spot cotton were traded, and prices rose one to two yuan. The market is as follows:</p>
<p>Middling 439 Shenxin Factory sent 100 bales to the factory</p>
<p>Also 445 also 200 bales also</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 186 also 200 packages warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Middling 432 Home 100 bales also</p>
<p>Also 428 also 210 bales also</p>
<p>India NT 379 also 100 bales also</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: The market situation was quiet and firm, rising due to poor weather reports and good cotton cloth trade. As a result, profits rose by 1 to 6 pounds sterling compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton Market: Initially, the market rose due to shorts covering, and then fell back due to brokers selling and longs taking profits. As a result, closing prices rose and fell from 0.5 to 2.5 rupees compared to the previous day. Opening forecasts for today show a fall of 0.25.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Brisk Sales of Cloth Rising Sharply</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: The market trend yesterday showed a slight improvement, due to the gradual increase in purchases by Hong Kong and Nanyang groups, coupled with loose money. Most of the inventory in the hands of fellow traders and speculators insisted on not releasing. Therefore, real sales of various brands were up very sharply. Plain cloth from Yihuo and other factories, light weight increased by five to seven and a half jiao per bolt. Military weight increased by two jiao and five fen, fine cloth and twill increased by two and a half to five jiao. Bleached and dyed cloth increased by about five jiao. Local street transactions for the current order flax yarn, printed cloth, foreign yarn and white canvas totalled over 300 pieces. New floral printed cloth from Luen Chang and Li Xin and other factories sold very well. Yuegang and Nanyang groups ordered over 400 pieces of dyed cloth, dyed twill and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning was flat, the afternoon rose, and the situation turned stronger. The opening price of white goods' Longtou fine cloth spot market was 44 yuan and 45 jiao. In the aftermarket, the warehouse receipts were exhausted, and the small investors were optimistic. It gradually rose to 45 yuan. At closing, the four gentlemen of dyed goods rose from 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 1 fen and 875 to 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. At the close, it rebounded slightly to 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 3 fen and 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Bulls and Bears Fight Fearing Huge Changes Announcement of Market Suspension Association Discusses Proper Solution</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s sugar market was initially flat, but later because the bulls urgently wanted to raise prices, they actually bought at 102 yuan. Although there was such a good price, the shorts did not dare to rashly respond, forming a contest between bulls and bears. The organizers, fearing that it would lead to huge changes, announced a market suspension. They held an emergency meeting in the afternoon to discuss a proper solution. The details are unknown. Generally, such a large number of ups and downs at the same time is also a "comedy" for both bulls and bears. The association divides the spot goods on the market: second and fourth grade coarse white outer warehouse, January old goods 90 yuan, February and March arrival 92 yuan, April arrival 93 yuan, without much difference. June 10th futures are 14 yuan, 3 yuan and a half, 3 yuan, June 20th futures are 94 yuan and a half, 5 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan and a half, 4 yuan and a half, and 4 yuan. Dutch red spot goods remain 70 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark is 104 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 jiao, rising by half a yuan. HX Mark East Warehouse is 90 yuan, 5 jiao and 90 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to the meeting.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Black and Green Teas Both See Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s foreign company tea market saw slight movement. Xingcheng, Haoshimen and other companies purchased more than 400 boxes of black tea from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces at a price of 420 yuan, a slight increase of 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. Yihuo, Jinlong and other companies also bought more than 50 boxes of shrimp eye green tea at a selling price of 290 yuan to 300 yuan. The market trend is also firm. At present, the source of new tea from various routes is still blocked. It is said that 200 loads were transported from Zhoushan and Ningbo, and merchants felt very distressed.</p>
<h3>Seafood Dried Scallops and Qilin Vegetables Rise Together</h3>
<p>Dried scallops have not been arriving recently, and various parties need them more actively, so the market situation suddenly turned tight. List prices have risen by several tens of yuan. Yesterday, medium grains opened up to 803 yuan, and broken grains also opened up to 660 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of squid are currently in balance, so the market is extremely stable. Yesterday's market selling price was 330 yuan, about 5 yuan better than before.</p>
<p>The existing inventory of Qilin vegetables is still thin. Yesterday, the market opened up a batch of West Lan vegetables, totaling 93 packages, priced at 94 yuan, up more than 10 yuan. The remaining Longya vegetables still sold for 73 to 74 yuan, and Wudun vegetables sold for 67 to 68 yuan. The market situation is tight.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items Spray Paint Has a Market But No Goods</h3>
<p>Spray paint raw materials are mainly gum sheets. In the past, local paint factories mostly relied on Hong Kong and Nanyang for supply. Transportation has been difficult after the war. Recently, various places have also controlled exports, resulting in a sudden interruption of supply. In the past month, market prices have soared, reaching several times higher. Currently, the price is about 7 yuan per pound, and there is still a market but no goods.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports Goods Arrived From North and South Oceans</h3>
<p>On the 4th, 1390 barrels of egg yolk and egg white and 130 pieces of tobacco industry were imported from Tianjin, 19 pieces of wild silk from Qingdao, 7 pieces of yellow silk from Yantai, and 200 pieces of iron and 910 packages of wax from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal Kailuan Coal Supply Abundant</h3>
<p>Kailuan bituminous coal, after the holiday, sales are still lacking in improvement. Frequent sources of supply cause current inventories to be abundant, and it is inevitable that people will be weak. After all, the difference between Kailuan coal price and the black market prices is still too far apart, which is the only reason. Yesterday's open peer market price for two grade lump coal was 360 yuan per ton, and the two grade coke was 295 yuan. Warehouse delivery and porterage additional, 100 yuan less than the highest price in the previous month.</p>

<h3>Cacao and Chocolate Gao Jiannong</h3>
<p>The flavor of cacao is so sweet and exquisite that the Swedish botanist Linne directly renamed its tree Cacaoyer as the "God's Food Tree!" This is due to the gratitude and appreciation of the mouth and stomach, but it is also based on the anecdotes that have been circulating in Mexico since ancient times. The anecdotes say: "The cacao tree originally grew in the 'Land of Happiness' where the first descendants of the sun god lived--a paradise of happiness, which is longed for by all people, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, civilized or barbarian! There was a prophetic gardener named Quatzaleautl who brought its seeds to the world: this was originally the food enjoyed by the gods..." Therefore, since ancient times, Mexicans have worshiped and cherished the cacao tree, believing that the food it provides is the most delicious and superior, and possesses incredible effects.</p>
<p>The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen tree, seven to eight feet tall, with white, porous wood that is extremely light and brittle, and gray branches. The leaves are alternate, drooping, elliptical in shape, with pointed ends, shiny green, and very large. The flowers are small, five-petaled, red or yellow in color, and grow in clusters in the leaf axils, but more commonly, they grow solitary on the lower half of the old trunk or on thick branches. The fruit is a drooping drupe, commonly called Cabosse, five to six inches long, weighing from one hundred to five hundred grams, also elliptical in shape, with a pointed top, red-yellow in color, astringent skin, and ten longitudinal deep grooves. Each fruit contains about twenty-five to forty seeds--cacao--divided into five petals, embedded in a pink, gelatinous pulp. The ripe pulp is sour and delicious, and can be eaten raw, or it can be made into a beverage that scholars love. The cacao beans are seven to eight minutes long and half an inch wide. After roasting, they can be made into so-called cacao powder. According to the results of chemical analysis: cacao contains 50% butter, 11% protein, 4% minerals, 32% starch paste, cell membrane substance, etc. In short, cacao includes various components, is extremely rich in nitrogenous matter, and contains a great deal of nutrients in the smallest mass. It is really the best and most ideal food! Cortez, the Spaniard who conquered Mexico in 1520 AD, exaggerated the quality of cacao to the point of saying: "A person can walk all day by eating just a bowl of this precious melted beverage, and does not need to eat any other food!"</p>
<p>The ancient Mexicans' emphasis on cacao can also be seen from the fact that they used it as circulating currency. The units of currency included the so-called le countle, equal to two hundred cacao beans; le Xiquipal equal to eight thousand cacao beans; and le carga valued at twenty-four thousand cacao beans. For example, when Cortez conquered Mexico, a city called Tabasco, bordering the Gulf of Mexico, had to pay tribute to King Montezuma one thousand Xiquipal, which is sixteen million cacao beans, every year! And the booty that Cortez got was forty thousand bags! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Groundnuts (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Yuyong</p>
<p>The earliest cultivation in our country was along the southern coast. The Tingzhou Prefecture Gazetteer states, "Originates from the Western countries, commonly known as 'foreign beans'." The Zhangzhou Prefecture Gazetteer states, "Originates from the Western countries, previously nonexistent." The "Hui Shu" states, "This variety all comes from Fujian." At that time, the yield was very small, and the demand was not significant. Later, it spread to the central region, and people gradually learned to utilize it. In 1791, the Italian missionary Father Ma Xian Tuo Nei believed that the climate in China was suitable for peanuts, and considered the northern bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangxi Province to be the best location. Later, a British gentleman named Lord Amherst also made a statement that peanuts were suitable for China, which attracted the attention of Europeans. At the end of the 19th century, the demand for peanut oil in Guangdong exceeded supply, leading to the promotion of cultivation to the north. At that time, an American missionary from the Holy Path Church, Thompson (Audrdeacon Thompson), brought a gallon of large-pod peanuts to Shanghai. He met Dr. Charles R. Mills of the Presbyterian Church. Thompson gave half of the seeds to him. Dr. Mills went to Dengzhou, Shandong, and distributed the seeds to two fellow Christians to plant, instructing them to only use them for sowing within a year and not to consume them. Later, one of the fellow Christians disobeyed and ate all the peanuts he had planted. Fortunately, the second fellow Christian followed his instructions, and three years later, he distributed the harvested seeds to farmers to plant. Because the seeds were large, the farmers were happy to plant them.</p>
<p>According to the local custom, when pressing raw oil, the shells were not removed. When they first used large-pod peanuts to press oil, they failed because the pressed oil was absorbed by the thick shells. Everyone was very discouraged. Later, someone taught them to remove the shells, and the results were excellent. Shandong's peanuts therefore multiplied greatly and became a major export. It is said that there is still a stone monument in front of the Penglai County Government Office to commemorate the achievements of this introducer. (End)</p>

<h3>Six Christian Universities in East China Held Joint Graduation Ceremony Yesterday - Bishop Li Xuan De Encouraged Over 400 Graduates to Utilize Their Learned Skills and Develop Their Creative Abilities</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the six Christian universities in East China, including Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Hangchow University, Soochow University, Shanghai Baptist College, and St. John's University, held a joint graduation ceremony at the Grand Theatre. Many guests, faculty, and students from various schools attended. There were a total of 436 university graduates. The American and Chinese flags, as well as the school flags of the six participating universities, were hung in the auditorium. Dozens of flower baskets were displayed in front of the stage, dazzling to the eye. The ceremony began on time. Guests, faculty from various schools, and graduates entered the hall in order to the sound of the U.S. Navy band. After everyone sang a hymn, Dr. Xia Fangji gave a prayer, followed by Dr. Li Pei'en, who expressed gratitude to the guests and encouraged the graduating students. Next, Bishop Li Xuan De delivered a speech in English, titled "The Creative Imagination," stating that the purpose of education is for teachers to understand the students' instinctive activities, guide them according to their aptitude, and allow them to develop freely along normal paths. It is absolutely impermissible to merely read books rigidly and bind their instinctive freedom of development. The progress of science throughout history has stemmed from having special ideals, creating experiments, and succeeding. Today, university graduates should continue to study in their respective fields, put their knowledge into practice in the world, not betray what they have learned, and have a spirit of creation. Next, Zhou Chengen, the principal of the Soochow University Affiliated High School, reported that 119 graduates from the high school, including Zhu Shishi, etc., were issued certificates by Dr. Wen Naishi, the acting president of the school. Next, Li Haoshan, the head of the Shanghai Baptist College Affiliated High School, reported that 67 graduates from the high school, including Zhang Qingxiang, etc., were issued certificates by Fan Zhengkang, the president of the school. Subsequently, the administrative authorities of the six universities, Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Hangchow University, Soochow University, Shanghai Baptist College, and St. John's University, successively awarded degrees to the graduates of each school. Afterwards, President Fan Zhengkang delivered a speech on behalf of the six universities to the graduates, saying that they had persevered during the national crisis, and it was fortunate that they were able to graduate. The existence of Christian schools has its own true spirit, making people believe, and the reputation of the school can be maintained. Although you are leaving your alma mater, you must still uphold the spirit of Christ's universal love, helping people, enduring hardship, and working hard to serve and bring honor to your alma mater. Then, the list of award-winning students from each school was read out, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Joint Graduation Ceremony of Six Universities in East China</h3>
<p>— Zhao Erqian</p>
<p>In the dim morning light with the threat of rain, countless young people, dressed in graduation gowns, gathered at the YMCA on Nanjing Road, and then marched in formation towards the Grand Theatre. In the procession were men and women, young and old, Chinese and foreigners, all assembled together. Some were silver-haired and youthful, others were handsome youths. Their attire was different from the ordinary, possessing a medieval mystical air, proceeding solemnly. Thus, they aroused the curious gazes of the citizens. Unexpectedly, in the central district, the heart of commerce, the elite of Shanghai's highest institutions of learning were discovered. This was the beginning of the graduation ceremony of the Six Universities in East China.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Grand Theatre, the degree-awarding ceremony immediately commenced. First, Doctor Xia Fangji gave a prayer. In his prayer, everyone heard him pleading in a solemn and pious tone for the happiness, unity, cooperation, and prosperity of China. Every word struck the hearts of everyone present. Next, Dr. Li Pei'en gave a speech, followed by Mr. Fan Zhengkang's exhortation. But the most moving of all was Doctor Li Xuande's speech. In the manner of an orator, he explained the importance of religious and moral education. University students who have received the highest education should shoulder their responsibilities and create a new world. Students are a force, a factor in stabilizing this tumultuous world.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were many guests, mostly relatives and friends of the students. They welcomed the graduates into the hall with smiles, expressing their boundless joy. The hundreds of graduating young people also beamed with smiles, advancing with a spirit of courage, moving slowly as if they were brides on a church floor, the wedding day carpet presenting a stumbling block with every step.</p>
<p>The graduation ceremony was held in an atmosphere of pomp. Each program was photographed, but because the interior of the Grand Theatre was dark, photography was difficult, resulting in flashes of light, reminiscent of Hitler's blitzkrieg, dazzling the eyes. However, we hope that the photographs will be successful, leaving a memento for the graduates of the Six Universities in East China.</p>
<p>Guan Zhong once said, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." Education is not an easy task, and education during wartime is especially difficult to sustain. However, in the fourth year of the Sino-Japanese War, the Six Universities in East China still had four hundred university graduates, which is truly a contribution to the nation. We further hope that the "four hundred Arhats" will strive, as Doctor Xuande said, to shoulder their responsibilities and create a new China.</p>

With a complete roster of talent, the association quickly rose to prominence. It remained undefeated in friendly matches and was truly a rising dark horse. In September last year, the association held the "Hardball Cup" Team and Individual Ping Pong Championship, adopting hardball matches, which was an unprecedented initiative in the ping pong community. All parties unanimously praised the initiative. The cup competition was held publicly for five times, with the number of spectators reaching several thousand. In particular, the association, with its team of talent, defeated the Jewish team, the Western Union Russian-Jewish Allied Forces in exhibition matches, fulfilling the mission of two great victories and earning unparalleled glory for the Chinese people.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On "Salary Increase"</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>Rising prices are followed by salary increase requests from the salaried class. If both sides are stuck in their stubborn preconceptions, then labor strikes and other disputes will result. This has become common knowledge today.</p>
<p>A few days ago (the 3rd), we saw news in various newspapers that the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) was going to increase salaries. We should congratulate the SMC employees and consider the SMC, which holds the administrative hub of the International Settlement, to be acting wisely. But we hope that the SMC can implement fundamental "surgery" on suppressing prices, and we also hope that the SMC's salary increase will pay attention to the following most important point:</p>
<p>That is, whether the method of uniformly increasing salaries by a certain percentage is reasonable is questionable.</p>
<p>Here, let's first talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this percentage increase:</p>
<p>On the advantage side, it is only for the convenience of settlement. We cannot find more sufficient reasons.</p>
<p>But on the disadvantage side, it creates the following results: those with high salaries receive even more, and the gap between the small and the large becomes even greater. But today, the stomachs that need to be fed are the same size for the entire society, no, the entire human race. Moreover, the poorer people are, the less they can afford to eat.</p>
<p>For example, a person earning a monthly salary of two thousand yuan (there are not few people in the SMC earning this much). Adding the original 150% allowance, they already have five thousand. Now, if they add another 40%, wouldn't it quickly become six thousand? No matter what, these friends cannot use that much money, so they use the remaining money for unnecessary consumption, which in turn helps create the abnormality in today's society and the ever-increasing cost of living for the poor. And the SMC's salary increase will never stop. We think this is not a reasonable salary increase method.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that, on the one hand, the demand for a reasonable standard of living should be considered for the majority of people, and on the other hand, the following methods may be adopted:</p>
<p>1. Regardless of the size of the salary, a uniform amount is added.</p>
<p>2. A certain amount is added for those below fifty, a certain amount is added for those below one hundred, and so on for two hundred and three hundred.</p>
<p>3. Or, increase rice allowances, like the SMC's current method, regardless of the size of the salary, because eating is the same, which is a reasonable method.</p>
<p>We are willing to sincerely provide the above three methods to the SMC as a reference for salary increase research, because in addition to the Customs and Post Office, companies such as electricity, telephone, and tram companies are also implementing them very well. Moreover, this can not only reduce the SMC's expenditures, but also be beneficial to social regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that since the salary increase of the SMC is called a "temporary living allowance," then it should meet the minimum reasonable condition of enabling people to "live"!</p>
<p>At the same time, we also hope that other agencies, schools, shops, or libraries, etc., should learn from the SMC!</p>
<h3>Sooner or Later</h3>

<p>Western Suit A: "Damn, just one minute short! It would have been great to have skipped one less round. 'Blood-Soaked Rivers and Mountains' must have started!" (Disheartened)</p>
<p>Western Suit B (Cheerfully coming out): "Brother, it's alright, they're just showing lantern slides for advertisements..."</p>
<p>Dancer A (Jumping out of a car): "What! The 11 o'clock Hula Dance... Damn it, why is my money so slow... Damn it!"</p>
<p>Dancer B: "Ha, you're really too eager to 'see'! You haven't even entered the door, how do you know... The Hula Dance hasn't even started yet, you're really overreacting."</p>
<p>(A claps his hands and laughs loudly, repeatedly: Psychological effect, mind...)</p>
<p>Diner (In a rickshaw): "Ah! The cold appetizers are probably finished, oh, and that shark fin soup... (Hastily enters the auditorium.)"</p>
<p>Receptionist: "Oh, Mr. So-and-so, you're just in time, quickly go and greet them."</p>
<p>(Turns out the officiant is just giving his speech.</p>
<p>He himself doesn't find it funny, but inwardly he's overjoyed, finally getting to eat the 'Full Family Fortune' dish).</p>
<p>Tenant: "What the heck, the lights are off, and we haven't even finished three rounds of cards..."</p>
<p>(A "pung" card is slammed down.)</p>
<p>Landlord (Loudly): "Go look at the clock, it's exactly twelve o'clock! Twelve o'clock, lights off, that's the rule!"</p>
<p>(Tenant hurriedly lights a candle to look, it's still one minute to twelve, wants to argue, but then it is exactly twelve o'clock.)</p>
<p>Mother: "Hey kid, run faster, the cheap rice (It's probably not called that anymore, but the poor still call it that!) will be sold out... Running is just using your legs anyway, we can't afford to be hungry..."</p>
<p>Son (Panting): "Mom, I ran all the way from Caojia Ferry, I can't even walk anymore, and I still have to run..."</p>
<p>(By the time they arrive, the rice shop hasn't even opened yet, but a long line of hungry people is already forming. Are they still late?)</p>
<p>Hostess: "Sir, you said two hours... I'm sorry, it's up!" (She acts coy.)</p>
<p>Client (Reluctantly): "Why are you so mindful of the time?" (The woman is despondent.)</p>
<p>This is in a certain room in a large hotel.</p>
<p>Unemployed Man (Reading the newspaper): "...No lodging provided, monthly salary eight yuan... Must be able to endure hardship, have a reliable guarantor... At × pm on × day, come to this office in person to negotiate..."</p>
<p>The wall clock in the so-called "office": "1:10 PM." (The doorway is already extremely crowded.)</p>
<p>This "unemployed man" is sweating profusely, clutching a streetcar ticket worth × angle × fen in his hand.</p>
<h3>A Knight's Act of Justice — A Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhi Da</p>
<p>I was strolling on the street. By chance, over there, I saw a Chinese and a Western woman chatting naturally, just coming out of a dim sum shop, each holding a bag of delicious pastries. They had just stepped into the street when a beggar followed them from behind, suddenly snatching the bag of delicious pastries from the Chinese woman's hand with his filthy hand. Logically, he should have quickly run away, but I don't know if it was because he had experience and didn't need to run fast, or because he was old and couldn't run fast, or because he was too weak from hunger to run fast? In any case, he wasn't running fast.</p>
<p>As for that fashionable young lady, perhaps to maintain her elegant figure, or perhaps because of the large amount of food, she didn't chase or get angry, but just gave a faint, captivating smile.</p>
<p>But the story didn't end there. Suddenly, a knight appeared from the side, a foreign knight. He was very alert, and swiftly and easily caught the offender. The beggar naturally suffered a beating, and naturally didn't resist. Unfortunately, the bag of delicious pastries was scattered all over the ground, and the knight stepped on them to express his inner anger.</p>
<p>Naturally, every passerby stopped to watch. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to observe the expressions of all the onlookers before getting on a bus. Even if I stuck my head out, I couldn't see clearly. The bus certainly wouldn't stop just for me to watch. I only heard a "heh-heh" laugh from a passenger behind me, and I couldn't guess what the "flavor" of the laugh was.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes on the bus.</p>
<h3>There Will Be This Day</h3>
<p>— Chang Yan Dao Zhi</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Many people have been looking forward to the arrival of summer, and their necks have been stretched for twelve months!</p>
<p>They say: "There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Only summer can show off its glory!"</p>
<p>The Beginning of Summer, the Dragon Boat Festival, salted duck eggs and zongzi have all been eaten. Who would stubbornly insist that it's still winter? So, summer has arrived!</p>
<p>Summer has arrived. A thousand words, where to begin? "We" gentlemen focus on the essential, and consider showing off to be paramount, to be the most important thing.</p>
<p>The 20th century is an era of "civilization," and barbarous habits should be swept away. Therefore, showing off is not about murder and arson, but about "displaying."</p>
<p>From white leather shoes to white teeth, from the instep to the hair, that's a "gentleman." Bare necks, exposed arms, bare feet, bare legs... that's a "lady." One is "graceful," one is "desirable." Thus, everywhere they go, they "display"; everywhere they walk, they "show off." National affairs can be "damned," but showing off is a must!</p>
<p>There are many places to "go" in the summer: besides dance halls and theaters, swimming pools and ice parlors are all excellent "summer resorts." And, I heard that your eyes can also eat "ice cream"...</p>
<p>Truly, great is my summer, beautiful is my summer, leisurely and carefree.</p>
<p>If someone rudely interrupts and says, "The 'bedbugs' in summer are annoying!" then you must be a complete fool. Because the words "bedbugs" have never existed in the minds of "gentlemen and ladies"!</p>
<p>Since that's the case, there's no need to say anything more. But when it comes to writing about summer, it's easy to write an essay like a primary school student: "Spring has gone, summer has come, the weather is very hot..." and write "freely and unrestrainedly" for hundreds of thousands of words. But I think it's enough to stop here, isn't it?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>Time waits for no one. In the blink of an eye, three years have passed unnoticed. But in this almost completely isolated Li Village, nothing has changed: three years ago, the fields were planted with wheat, sorghum, and cotton; now they are still the same. Three years ago, the village had only forty or fifty households, and now it still maintains this record, not one more, not one less. The old ox goes to the fields with its master every day, and the tired, skinny mule drags the heavy cart back and forth on the small road. Simply nothing has changed.</p>
<p>If one must say that there have been some changes, then the first would be Wu San.</p>
<p>Three years ago, on a late autumn evening, when the sunlight was less than half swallowed by darkness, the doors of almost every household in the village were closed. In the grayish-yellow fields, only the figures of a few naughty children were floating. Suddenly, a mule cart drove from the east and quietly stopped in front of the newly built large tile house of Old Master Wu's family. Then, several people got off the cart and were led into the house by Old Master Wu. Finally, two or three able-bodied men from the Wu family carried many things from the cart, including boxes, trunks, and silk baskets, very much as if relatives of the Wu family had come specifically to rely on them.</p>
<p>The next morning, Old Master Wu carried a dry tobacco pipe and personally invited a dozen or twenty elderly people to his house for a drink, saying that his nephew, Lao San, had lost his wife in Tianjin and there was no one to take care of his three-year-old daughter, so he had simply moved back there to live.</p>
<p>Everyone went to his house to take a look, and his nephew was still just a young man in his mid-twenties, wearing a neat long gown, looking very much like a businessman. He was also very friendly, respectfully calling these old men "old uncles" and "old grandfathers." But there was one very strange thing, and that was the large piece of white cloth wrapped around his face! (215)</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Shanghai's Spoken Drama Scene</h3>
<p>— Xi Di</p>
<p>This year is the "Spoken Drama Year."</p>
<p>Here, we would like to report to the readers of the Entertainment World on the latest developments in the Shanghai spoken drama scene. The spoken drama groups that are emerging today can be roughly divided into two categories: "professional" and "amateur." The "professional" theater troupes that exist now are the "Shanghai Drama Art Society," "China Travel," "Tianfeng," and the "Huazheng," which was recently formed by outstanding actors from the film industry. The "Shanghai Drama Art Society" relied on the box office success of "Family" to gain a foothold, and is now staging Wu Zuguang's "Song of Righteousness." This is a great historical drama in ancient costume, which narrates the moving historical facts of Wen Tianxiang's loyalty and love for his country, directed by Wu Jiangfan. The cast is quite strong. Film stars such as Zhou Qi, Lan Lan, and Han Fei have all joined as guest actors, and Shi Hui's role as Wen Tianxiang, like Liu Qiong's role as Zheng Chenggong in the past, is full of enthusiasm and deeply moving, leaving the audience with lingering aftertastes after leaving the theater. This type of spoken drama is truly worthy of recommendation.</p>
<p>"China Travel" is currently performing "Hong Xuanjiao," which is similar in nature to "Song of Righteousness." This drama was first performed at the Lyceum. It won social praise, and is now being staged continuously at the Carlton Theater, with undiminished box office success. The playwright is Wei Ruhui, the director is Fei Mu, and the costume designer is Hu Xuguang. It is said that the Micheng Film Company has decided to bring "Hong Xuanjiao" to the screen, and has invited the original cast, including Tang Ruoqing and others, to take on the roles, with a contract value breaking the film industry's historical record, which can be described as extremely generous. "Tianfeng" seems to be finding its way in modern dramas. It is currently performing "Grace and Revenge" at the Xuan Palace. This drama was originally named "Chronicle of Blood-Soaked Rouge," written by Yu Ling and adapted by Wu Chen, and directed by Luo Peng. "Huazheng" has performed several one-act plays in the past, but unfortunately, none of them have achieved good results. They have decided to make persistent efforts and stage Jiang Shangqing's "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" at the Lyceum. This is a story about Yue Fei. The cast has been properly arranged and includes Wang Xianzai as Qin Hui, Huang He as Yue Fei, Chen Qi as Yinping's mother, and Zhou Qi as Niu Gao (details omitted). They are preparing to start performing on the 20th, and are actively rehearsing at the Micheng Factory these days.</p>
<p>There are countless "amateur" theater troupes, such as "Zhengfeng," hosted by You Guangzhao and Tian Zhendong, "Hongying," led by Cai Bingbai and Cao Zhenzhong, and others such as "Weiwei," "Yilin," and many theater troupes organized by major middle schools, the Silver Industry, the Chinese United Club, and others. "Zhengfeng" has too few talents. You Guangzhao wears an Indian silk gown every night, sweating in his small living room, leaning back on his hands, pacing back and forth, reciting his lines, explaining to the members, and gesturing as he does so. His spirit is admirable! "Hongying" appears in the form of opera and now has more than sixty male and female members, most of whom are from academia. They are all very capable in their work. They performed "The Flower Girl" in the past and received good reviews. The play was written and directed by Cai Bingbai and composed by Zhang Hao. They may perform it again at the Grand Shanghai Theater recently. In September, they will also perform a mythological drama like "The Wizard of Oz." The plot is very interesting and the meaning is absolutely serious. It will still be written and directed by Cai Bingbai. Mr. Cai is well-versed in opera. "The Shanghai Song" made a splash. This mythological drama is his second shot, and it is expected that the results will be extraordinary. Opera fans should wait and see.</p>
<p>Having written this far, I should draw a conclusion. I think: The rise of spoken drama troupes is certainly a good phenomenon, but everyone must stand on their own positions. It is wrong and unacceptable to only aim at "making money" and treating it as a "pastime." We must remember the mission that this difficult era has given to playwrights. What is it?</p>
<h3>Saying Goodbye, Hearing Hui Sheng</h3>
<p>— Tai Wu Jushi</p>
<p>"Selling Horses": Full Performance Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>Since Xun Huisheng's second appearance in the Golden Hall, his term is about to expire. A few days ago, due to a cold, he insisted on performing on stage, resulting in several excellent plays that could not be premiered in advance. Now that Huisheng's cold has healed, and because his departure is imminent, he is pre-announcing that the new plays will be successively contributed to those who love to watch Xun's plays. For example, tonight's complete "Red Phoenix Wedding" and "Fan Jiang Pass," two double acts, are also rare and famous dramas in the Xun style. Tomorrow night (Saturday) will be the full performance of "Selling Horses," starting with Li Qi selling horses to other families, Yang Huatian committing adultery with Wang Tong, Guizhi protecting Tong being driven away, committing suicide and being rescued, Chunhua hanging herself, Hu Jing accepting bribes, Li Qi being falsely accused, creating a wrongful imprisonment, Guizhi marrying Zhao Chong, Tong becoming a circuit censor, and then continuing with Li Qi crying in prison, Guizhi writing a complaint, the three reuniting, and ending with Tian Wang and Yang Hua being executed. The tragic family changes caused by selling horses will be performed one by one, which is much more exciting than the usual single performance of half the play. Hui Niu plays Guizhi from beginning to end, Xu Hecai plays Zhao Chong, He Wenqian cross-dresses as Bao Tong, Li Wenxi plays Chunhua, Chen Xixing plays Li Qi, Zhu Binxian plays Yang Sanchun, Wang Duoshou plays Tian Wang, Cao Lianxiao plays Liu Zhishan, Li Yishou plays Hu Jing, and Luo Xiaokui plays Jinzi. The entire play is first Peking opera and then Kunqu opera, and it takes four hours to perform. This play has been out of the singing world for more than twenty years. Huisheng obtained it from Wang Yaoqing, and Yaoqing obtained it when he was serving in the inner court in those years, so its value is evident. In the Liyuan circle, there are very few people who can perform this play other than Huisheng.</p>
<h3>The Art of Watching Movies</h3>
<p>— Wen Xun</p>
<p>(1) When choosing the film you want to watch, you should base your decision on the director's past achievements and reputation, and never on the star of the film, otherwise you will definitely be fooled.</p>
<p>(2) You must not have a fixed idea that this film is good, or you will often be disappointed.</p>
<p>(3) You must not have an attitude of absolute appreciation of art, or you will lose the value of recreation.</p>
<p>(4) You don't need to watch too many films of a similar nature, or you will easily get bored.</p>
<p>(5) It is best to watch fewer films with upper and lower episodes, otherwise you will easily suffer losses. (Because good films do not necessarily have upper and lower episodes.)</p>
<p>(6) Do not sit next to a smoking moviegoer (if you yourself do not like to smoke), otherwise the smell of his smoke will distract your mind from watching the show and make you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>(7) Do not sit in a seat behind a couple, because your line of sight will often be blocked by their heads, and your neck may be sore after the show.</p>
<p>(8) When you see something interesting, do not laugh too loudly, or you will be resented by others.</p>
<p>(9) When you see something sad, do not shed too many tears, or it is not worth it, and your tearful traces will be laughed at after the show.</p>
<p>(10) If you decide to watch a certain film, do not ask those who have already seen it, and do not listen to them telling you about the "gimmicks" of the film, otherwise you will not feel interested when you go to see it yourself.</p>
<p>Ms. Yao Shuijuan and the entire Yue Opera troupe, will soon return to the Queen's Theatre to perform, and will reportedly present "Tears and Laughter Because of Predestined Affinity" as their first performance on stage.</p>

<h3>Silver Scenery Line</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>After Zhang Yi finishes "Children of the World", he originally intended to go to Hong Kong immediately, but recently he has been invited by the Micheng Company and will play Shi Dakai in the film "Hong Xuanjiao," so Zhang has decided to suspend his trip to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's famous book "Resurrection" will reportedly be adapted by Yihua and brought to the screen, and it is said that Shan Yuefeng and Chen Huanwen have been decided as co-directors, and the screenwriter is still Qi Yifang.</p>
<p>The previously published report that Hezhong will be filming an ancient costume film "Long Dan Hu Xue" is reportedly a mistake for "Long Tan Hu Xue."</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Petals</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Gongsun's Sword Qi is Initially Displayed</p>
<p>Liu Yinying said up to this point, Wang Yongtai nodded and said, "Just now, this old man was sitting in meditation, not yet asleep. My eyes were closed, and my thoughts were disturbed. I didn't know the reason, but suddenly I heard a sound outside the window. My heart moved, and I immediately took my dagger and jumped out of the room. I saw a person knocked down on the ground, and opposite him was standing this Mr. Liu. I didn't know the truth, so I asked Mr. Liu. Who knew that Mr. Liu didn't know this person either. He told me that he had come here with a friend, and just happened to see this person looking like an assassin, so he fired a dart and knocked him down. So I thanked Mr. Liu for his help, but I didn't ask his name, and first questioned the assassin on the ground." Xu Jing said, "Strange, Uncle has always treated people very well, without resentment or enmity. Where did the assassin come from?" Wang Yongtai said, "The assassin confessed honestly that he was sent by the rebel Li Zicheng. After Li Zicheng left Tongguan, he was advancing into Jin Province. He heard that General Zhou Yuji was preparing his troops here, ready to attack head-on. Daizhou was not easy to take suddenly, so Li Zicheng listened to the conspiracy of his military advisor and specially sent three warriors to Daizhou to assassinate General Zhou and this old man. Heaven helped this old man to avoid being assassinated, and it was not without Mr. Liu's help." Xu Jing was shocked when he heard this and said, "The assassin was sent by Li Chuang? Then where are the other two?" Wang Yongtai said, "The assassin said that there were two others who had gone to General Zhou's camp to assassinate him." Xu Jing said, "How is General Zhou? This is also worrying." Wang Yongtai said, "This old man just heard this news and has already sent servants to General Zhou's office to inquire. But I know that General Zhou has been very vigilant recently, with guards all around him. The rebels will never succeed." Xu Jing said, "I hope so. Where is the assassin now?" Wang Yongtai said, "I have already tied up that fellow and handed him over to the servants to guard, and I will take him to General Zhou's office tomorrow to question him." Xu Jing also asked, "Brother Liu and Uncle are not acquainted with each other. How did you talk to each other?" Liu Yin said, "Just because when we were questioning the assassin, the assassin confessed the name of Old Hero Wang. This younger brother has long admired Jingzhou, so I paid my respects to Old Hero Wang. Old Hero Wang asked me why I came here, and this younger brother told the truth. Old Hero Wang was very surprised and told me that Jing Brother was his nephew and left here in a fit of anger. He heard me say that you had been here, so he went to the upstairs behind to see what was going on and told this younger brother to wait here." (82)</p>
<h3>An Outline of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>There is no problem in the world that cannot be solved, and there is no problem that mankind cannot solve. All problems have content, and all content has clues. All clues can be followed, but the content may be difficult or easy, and the clues may be complex or simple.</p>
