<h3>赫爾國務卿透露　美日談判無新進展　測驗太平洋問題有無解決可能　試探談話限期一月至明日屆滿</h3>
<p>合衆社十四日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨於報界會議時稱、美日談判並無新發展、對所詢東京與擊盛頓傳巳有一基本協定之說、赫爾稱、談判至目前爲止、仍屬試探性質、而以測騐解決太平洋問題的談判是否可能之理解、爲根據云、</p>
<p>合衆社十四日倫敦電　此間可恃外交界人士昨稱、彼等獲悉美國已規定美日試探性談判之最後時間、最多延至星期二爲止、該界人士又稱、華盛頓爲阻止向來日本之延宕方法計、內此談判限定爲一月、此時期於星期二爲止、但此時期有否展期則不可知、</p>
<p>路透社十四日沃克蘭電　紐西蘭首相法萊塞由英國及北美歸來後、曾發表談話云、美日談話現仍在微妙階段中、惟有一事頗爲顯明者、即不致有以國聯爲犧牲之綏靖政策是、希望日本對此事實將能予以接受、　在美時曾與羅斯福總統透澈討論太平洋局勢云、</p>
<p>路透社十四日東京電　日本通訊社消息云、日本無任所公使及駐美大使野村特別顧問若杉、返東京商議甫及兩週、現定明日下午三時由橫濱啓程回華盛頓任所、據目前所知、明日並無任何船隻由橫濱開往美國或其他地方、亦無其他乘客將同時起程之證據、惟若杉之怱怱返任可表示美日談判之圓滿結果、尙未絕望、據現時情形觀察、日本之提議與美國之對案、似旣非全部滿意、亦非完全不能接受也、</p>
<p>談話經歷三個階段　成敗尙在未定之天</p>
<p>合衆社十四日倫敦電　英美對日關於遠東及太平洋之諒解之大綱、昨日似在形成中、惟東京與華盛頓之談話之命運旣未解決、則最後之決定尙在未定之天、觀察家相信、東京關於討論臨中主要之建議、尙未作確切之決定、此項討論似針對日本在華中及華南之撤退、聞考慮中者有日本保證不在北方再事作犧牲蘇聯之擴張、及在南方作犧牲英美荷及泰國之侵略、日本經四載之戰爭、除在中國及越南之經濟慾望外、將願放棄其他一切、即以此而言、似將促合民主國家作重大之讓步、而相當顧及日本之面子、凡此種種、似預測對於日本在中國及其他若干東亞區域特殊經濟地位之承認、及一切對日財政及商務制裁之解除、　美國及日本在此種談判中、已獲得蘇聯之直接而重要之支援、美國關於日本之立塲、相信因蘇聯已不撤退其遠東之任何軍隊及飛機之消息而略見强硬、可靠消息稱、蘇聯之遠東軍隊、其人力與物力依然完整、莫斯科亦已決定拒絕對日本作任何領土之讓步、亦不對東京綏靖、荷英現與美國在太平洋有密切之合作、而中國對民主國家有緊固之效忠、又據最後消息、表明蘇聯在遠東ABCD陣綫、已作首次而特殊之行動、雖然詳情不能獲悉、但外交界人士謂巳獲得美日談判清晰之背景、據傳第一階段爲華盛頓在日本未佔領越南前、提議將越南與泰國造成與瑞士國相同之中立、但日本加以拒絕、且從而佔領越南、因此此項提議、祇得作廢、第二階段爲美國於越南被日佔領以後、再度提出要求、謂倘日本在越南撤退、則美國將解凍日本之資金、並廢止商業之禁運、當此消息傳至蔣委員長時、重慶方面大感不安、第三階段之開始、爲日本不顧美國之建議、自提一包括二要點之計劃、要求新加坡·荷印·菲律濱·及澳洲停止擴充軍備、及美國利用其地位以達成中日之和平解決、此間之外籍外交家稱、聞華盛頓並未考慮此後之措置、竟同意以日本之建議爲根據、與東京進行談話、殊令人駭異、此舉似與羅斯福總統與邱吉爾在海上會議歸來以後與日本大使野村之第一次談話相吻合、相信華盛頓爲避免日本之一貫延宕方式、已限定談話爲期一月、於下星期一滿期、此後是否再行延長談話之時期則尙未悉、傳美國於八月間更表明立塲、已對日本發出警告、阻止其向蘇聯北進或繼續南進、</p>
<p>日本對美覓取諒解　陸軍改組意義重大</p>
<p>合衆社十四日東京電　據遠東視察家意見、日本希企能與美國改進關係、若談判失敗、日本已準備盡力企圖東方擴大其覇權、否則祇能一死以了之、觀察家指出日本陸軍之新集中管理、此舉表示緩和太平洋之緊張局勢、但亦表示更有効之全國動員、若干觀察家意見、日本希企能與美國改進關係、若談判失敗、日本已準備盡力企圖東方擴大其覇權、否則祇能一死以了之、觀察家指出日本陸軍之新集中管理、此舉表示緩和太平洋之緊張局勢、但亦表示更有効之全國動員、若干觀察家以爲、日本因昔日政策之結果、將不能在今日情勢下、解脫其難關、况美國決不放棄門戶開放機會均等之一貫政策、因此日本若不再作讓步、日前談判勢必失敗、尙有數事値得注意者、即日本駐滿洲及越南之軍隊、尙未包括在此次東京之陸軍變更程序之內、此因上述各處之日軍、仍得保持其一貫的獨立行動之權利云、</p>
<h3>美政府考慮　武裝商船　目前尙不致實現　總統重作海上游</h3>
<p>合衆社十四日華盛頓電　美國商船因迭遭襲擊、因此衆均提議商船亦得加以武裝、此事現正在討論中、但官方人士昨稱、此舉於最近期內、恐不致實行、據觀察家所悉、若干國會議員於最近羅斯福總統在白宮與立法領袖會談時、曾提出此事、傳總統表示、渠將於數日以後提出此項要求、</p>
<p>路透社十四日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統已乘汽車離此、前往安那波里斯、俾合其游艇作週杪海上之遨游、總統將於週杪與國防及租借案要員、商討出產與分配問題、</p>
<h3>游擊隊在滿隱匿　候機攻擊日軍　約十萬人現在刻苦訓練</h3>
<p>重慶　某游擊隊領袖本日語合衆社稱、現有中國高麗及蒙古游擊隊十萬、隱匿於滿洲之古松林及積雪所蓋之山中、候機攻擊日本關東軍云、該領袖現時在重慶渠稱、此輩强有力之遊擊隊現五渴望日方行動、因其可立即成爲蘇聯遠東紅軍之大規模第五縱隊也、渠稱、此輩在滿洲境內之有力紅軍配備頗佳、且由蘇聯中國高麗甚至日本國籍之軍事敎練員、依照蘇聯紅軍及共黨之主義施以刻苦之訓練、該領袖又稱、此輩遊擊隊使用蘇聯之斧鐮旗爲彼等之國旗云、（十四日合衆電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>美日談判的基本問題</h3>
<p>昨日本報社評，論及華盛頓與東京雙方關於美日談判消息的紛歧，謂以美當局平時態度的坦白公止，談判而果成立協定，斷無隱瞞不言之理。頃據美京消息。美國務卿赫爾已於隔昨明白吾認美日業已在原則上成立協定的傳說，足見吾人所見不虛。近頃東京不斷傳來妥協消息，這是自慰，　是烟幕。不過今日最重要的中心問題、並不在於妥協能否成立，而在於妥協成立的條件如何，假如日方眞能悔禍史張，停止一切擴展企圖，使遠東恢復十年以前的原狀，則任何人士當均不反對這種妥協的成立，但在目前那顯然是不可能的事。</p>
<p>檢討近一月來美當局關於遠東問題的種種表示，在原則上堅持着立塲不變，對談判則力言無所進展，而於其間雙方見解，談判基礎，則始終無所宣示，這也就是最啟世人憂疑的所在。固然，外交大事首貴機密，爲了袪除不良影響，無甯嚴守秘密之爲愈，有如英當局之於赫斯事件即其一例。但目前這一問題，據美方所表示，雖謂談判仍屬試探性質，用以測騐太平洋問題的談判杲吾可能，而此一月間雙方頻繁而密切的接觸，相信其絕非僅只浮光掠影的在籠統原則上有所商洽，無疑當已觸到若干重大的根本問題，所謂要試探談判是吾需要或可行，也就等於說要試探在根本意見上雙方能吾達到一致的觀點。是以目前所進行者縱屬試探，其所得結論亦必與正式談判同樣足以決定未來前途的發展。在這一點上，所謂初步談判與正式談判，形式上縱或有異，在本質上並沒有重大差別。</p>
<p>在現行國際情勢下，任何國家所耍放在第一位去考慮的都只是自身利害問題，這本來無可非議且不應非議。美國對日的强硬設施，是日本締結三國同盟—尤其是淮兵越南所引起的，所以美方所考盧者，主要着眼於不再南進和退出軸心兩點；至於其是否因爲希望日本幡然改圖棄軸心而親英美，因而不惜有所優容或讓步，目前也許還言之過早，並也與美國根本立塲和不採綏靖政策約言相刺謬，不過像昨日合衆社所傳倫敦消息中關於美日討論內容的初决官示，則容或與事實不甚相遠。然而今日的遠東問題太複雜了，如果試謀解決之道，在理解上不能不做正本淸源的探求，在應付上不能不有兼籌並顧的考慮，苟安近利的觀念只足以貽禍將來，扭曲了反對侵略維護正義的基本立塲亦將在未來的光明前途和世人心理上留一暗影。現在中國實力正以戰具到達而迅速增强，蘇聯亦有在遠東强硬支持民主國立塲的決意，日本如眞小惜走向極端（不顧一切以擴大霸權，那前途只有如昨日合衆社東京消息所說的「以一死了之」，民治陣綫對此是無須憂慮的。美國的實施禁運與凍結資金，除却在自身利害關係上的報復警告意義而外，更負有一種道義上的責任，那也就是此决羅邱所發宣言以及遂行反侵略戰爭的根本精神。英國不肯爲了無可避免的敗衂和損失而不去赴援希臘，此一精神感召的力量要遠超過日本脫離軸心所能給予民治陣綫的助力。更何况就此際日本處境與存心而論，除却亟求解除經濟重壓並藉置身國際兩大對立陣營之間挾以自重而外，誰也不敢保證其誠意究曾達到何等程度。</p>
<p>如果所傳日方關於新加坡荷印菲島澳洲停止擴軍及由美國助日達到中日和平的建議確屬事實（那大槪也就是近衛函件的內容），則可斷言美日間的談判必鮮成就。在最近中國又曾一度宣示繼續作戰的決心，有如日軍僅從華中華南撒退而日本則保持在中國的特殊經濟地位的條件（見合衆社倫敦電），那只有更促進中國作戰到底。在今日遠束大局中，中國態度與動向實爲最重要的一個有決定作用的因素，是任何友邦都不容加以忽視的。更何况即使日本承諾不再南進北進，也勢難使南洋各屬弛其戒備，正有如蘇日中立協定之不能使蘇聯撒退其遠東大軍一樣。因此吾人深信赫爾所稱談判無所進展當屬事實。據傳明天就是試探談話截止之日，假使雙方原有見解無所改變，銳意擴展的一方迄無悔禍誠意，而一以拖延時日以便進行佈置爲事，則已往的一月時日已嫌屬於無謂的耗費，更沒有再加繼續的必要。至於遠柬前途，如聽其繼續着一月以前的局勢從事發展，則除却野心者而外，任何人都沒有悲觀的理由。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（七）　蘇聊的廣土衆民</h3>
<p>俄國人不喜歡做例行公事，而很願有機會作特殊的驚人表演。蘇俄報紙常宣佈某工人的生產率特別高，但據外國工程師和技師一致的意見，就工人全體每日的牛均生產率而論，蘇俄上人是還在泰西各國標準之下的。若干年前，蘇俄很注意在北極地方種植楊莓和共他外國小菓，同時却顯然忽略了亦其他更有和地方圓闢菓園的可能性。</p>
<p>俄國人現在生活的外表，巳在多方面受到革命的影響。社會階級巳顯趨平等，都市中人口大增，許多新工廠，工人住宅，職員辦公處，和莫斯科地道等等，都已表示現代化了。</p>
<p>蘇聯有一所規模宏大的汽車製造廠，是摹仿福特工廠而建築的，不過生產能力却瞠乎其後。因爲蘇俄的公路旣少且劣，所以汽車業並不十分發達</p>
<p>蘇俄農民佔全人口三分之二，革命以後，農民的心理和生活已完全改觀。共產黨獲取政權後的第一個成績，便是准許農民全數攫　和瓜分地主的產業。革命後十二年的蘇俄土地，已全分爲平均十九至二十　畝的小農住宅，土地的自由買賣早被禁止了。蘇聯並曾積極進行工業化計劃，把大批農民吸引入新興工業，工人的生活也已有着極大變動。</p>
<p>工人和農民一樣，年齡不同的工人中間有着明顯的分野。靑年工人極易爲蘇維埃的口號所感動。而年長者則更注意於實際生活。蘇維埃政府的呼籲，一向着重於國防，而於革命及集體農塲的成績如何，不着詞，此於蘇聯民衆心情或者很有關係吧！</p>
<p>若以蘇聯西部地利而言，列寗格勒有許多造船廠，可以建造戰鬥艦，航穴母艦，潛水艇和別種艦船。蘇聯的海軍大砲也是在該處普蒂洛夫鋼鐵廠製造的。克降斯達特是波羅的海沿岸唯一的重要軍港。塞伐斯多波爾則是黑海沿岸的主要軍港，其附近也有造船廠多所</p>
<p>德軍若能佔據上述各港，其海軍實力自可大見增强，蘇聯原有商船共一百四十萬噸，或者也小免因而被其攫奪一部份軸心各國在公海上的局勢屆時也將改觀。現在遭受威脅的波羅的海和黑海之間，即可直接通航，它們並可騰出相當海軍力，自黑海護送貨物前往地中海方面歐洲沿岸各港，以緩和歐陸經濟恐慌。</p>
<p>蘇聊內地運河四通八達，在運輸上極關重要。內河許多輪船和汽艇，若有一　部落於德軍之手，他們一定會善加利用。</p>
<p>從純粹經濟覜點而論，烏克蘭，高加索及白俄羅斯，最是豐饒區域。承半時代，蘇聯出口穀類，什么產自烏克蘭。該區富於糖黍麥和煤鐵。蘇聯全國僅有的錳礦，幾乎全部在烏克蘭。</p>
<p>近年以來，蘇聯當局雖曾在烏拉爾山脈以由塞佛特羅夫斯克及奇爾耶平斯克兩處，和中亞細亞方而開辦工廠多所，但大多數機器製造廠和鍊鋼廠，仍舊設在烏克蘭，允以基輔哈柯夫，敖持薩及尼潑洛貝脫羅維斯克附近爲最多。</p>
<p>白俄羅斯富於牲畜，穀類及蕃署。高加索小僅出產煤汕，且以富於銅裘及森林著稱。蘇聯西部這幾區域還產有入量的姓口，許多的亞麻田，以及數千畝的植物的田地，德國脂肪匱乏，自必唾涎欲滴。</p>
<p>高加索若果陷落，紅軍在撤退前，即使從事怎樣廣　的破壞工作，也不能使該區停止產油至一年以上。從表面上看，好像德軍倘能逼迫紅軍向束撤退，就可攫得大量的物產和設備，那時德國的軍需即可獲有無窮盡的新資源，並可開闢新的交通路綫，打開英國的海上封鎖。</p>
<p>可是問題並不這麼簡單。上决歐戰期間，德軍也會控制烏克蘭全區幾及洛斯托夫地方，但結果無濟於事。俄國歷來運輸困難，就是德國的組織專家也一難莫展。這種情形定必重見於今日。蘇聯　族富於潛在的破壞力。但根本上的困難還不在此。</p>
<p>第一，德國倘爲防止歐洲飢饉起見，把蘇聯的食糧和富藏西運至歐陸，那麼蘇聯被佔領區任何地方，都有發生飢荒的可能，因而結怨於佔領區人民。即如去年四月，蘇聯曾允運送穀類二十五萬噸，救濟比利時，結果僅運出九分之一，而蘇聯西部食糧匱乏情形，即已尖銳化了。何况烏　蘭今年收穫，必因戰事而大受打激呢</p>
<p>蘇聯的農產，大部份依靠曳引機器車，惟因農業機械化之故，汽汕已成爲農務必需品。去年蘇聯共產油五千二百萬噸，輸出的僅一百萬噸。一力二七產產油量述較去年爲少。却蝓出六百萬噸之多。這與其說是貯油備戰，母寗說是因爲農業上用途激增所致。今年幾千處機器車站，倘不能按時分派汽油，耕種自必大受影響，那麼蘇聊本身就不免發生飢饉，枉論救濟歐洲了。</p>
<p>德國當局明知佔領蘇聯西部的利益，年內絕難兌現，顯然希望能够趕快鞏固陣地，以備應付長期戰爭而巳。</p>

萬元。又傳以後每月供給總額亦將以六百萬元爲限。如照此數按月供給，尙可維持十四個月以上。據最沂海關統計，每月平均入超不足八白萬美元，一部份進口貨經淸單剔除以後，六百萬元或已足供所需。（然此究係傳說，不可爲訓，每月供給限額，平準儘有仲縮，自不必預先示人）所成問題者即出口外匯之未能盡入掌握耳。　　（二）供給外匯之對象問題此　問題已由試行辦法及甲乙兩類淸單正式答覆，如該辦法第一第二及第三條之規定　　（一）淸單甲所載主要進口物品，（包括運費及保險費），如進口商尙未結匯或由消費奢供給，經向平準會申請核准後，得按照攤派方法供給外匯。　　（二）淸單乙所載其他主要進口物品（包括運費及保殮費）經甲請核准後，得供給外滙。　　（三）（Ａ）甲乙　淸單及禁入物品表所未列入之决要進口物品，得由牛準會供給外滙，每一交易，以美金　千元或英金五百鎊爲限。（Ｂ）個人匯款，旅費，保險費等得由平準會供給相當數額，每人或每家庭每月以美金二百元或英金五十鎊爲限。　　由此可知供給外匯之對象包括准許結匯之進口貨値，運費及保險費與個人費用三項，最後一項即爲便利外僑而設。　　（三）各秤准許結匯進口貨應得　外匯攤額問題　　前一項問題決定以後，每月供給之外匯紗額應按何種比例攤派於各該進口貨品。按各國外匯管理成例，在短期間內多有以准許進口物品過去半年或年之輸入總値爲計算攤派比例之標準者，就維持本埠工商業之立塲言，採用此法攤派，亦未始不可。其計算方法如决、、假定一年來准許結匯之進口貨總値爲一萬五千萬兀美金，而米一項之進口總値爲三千萬元，則米應得之攤派比例爲百分之一十，若以每月六百萬元爲供給限額，則米應得外匯一百二十萬兀。但此　分攤辦法，似不適用於今日之上海，蓋平準會　能統制外滙而不能統制物價。在外匯自由買賣時代，如某種貨物缺乏，價格飛漲，即有引致進口增加之可能，易言之，即進口貨之供給彈性較大，有自動即制居奇之作用。今若將外匯攤額，按固定比例分配，則某種進口貨應得之外匯，一經支用滿額，除向再黑市購買以外，即無進口之可能，至此，則是項物品之供給彈性將趨於零，其巳在特許銀行按公定匯率結得外匯而輸入是項物品者，亦將執持居奇。故按此法攤派，結果或足以造成少數商家獨佔利得之機會，此點平準會似應指令特許銀行予以停止結匯之權利，以爲制裁；同時應將外匯攤額隨時予以調整，而於大衆生活有關之進口物品如　煤等項所需外匯允應予以伸縮性較大之攤額　　（四）准許結滙商家應得之外滙攤額問題　　各項進口外匯攤額決定以後，尙須核定各該進口商應得外滙之攤額，核定肚項攤額，除有特殊情形以外，似宣探取固定之比例分配法，以示公允而免流弊，各商應得比例可以過去一年或半年之進口數値爲計算之標準，譬如合法之洋米進口商共六家，一年來洋米進口總値爲三千萬兀，甲商佔六百萬元，則甲商應得攤額五分之一，如洋米可結滙一百二十萬元，則甲商可得二十四萬元，但如各商營業有消長變動時，則攤派比例，亦須予以調整也。　　此外出口外滙之管理，亦爲一主要問題上所傳六百萬萬元當係最２抵補外滙收支不敷之數；茲後如不能抓住出口外滙，則不敷之數勢將增大，故試行辦泱第八條特規定如下：　　「商人自特許銀行取得外滙時，應將所有出口匯票售與此等銀行，如商人不遵從此項規定，平準會得不予供給外滙」。　　上海有許多洋行進出口貿易兼營，平時進口外滙向銀行結　，出口外滙品售與銀行，今以有再黑市存在，如其進口外滙按五·三一二五之滙率向銀行申請，出口外滙則按四。八四三七五售與黑市，事太便宜，自應予以如本條所規定之制裁。事實上再黑市已由十四家特許銀行停止非按公定滙率之買賣，此後縱有公定滙率以外之交易，恐亦僅限於進出口商之　接交易而已，但進出口商直接交易之發展，亦足以影響出口外滙　管理，此决上海外滙管理之實施旣出於友邦凍結之助力，此一漏洞，原在凍結之例，是　美英進口商應付國出口商之貨款，依照凍結去令，不能自由移轉。故美英當局儘可根據法令，限定美英商人自中國輸入貨物，必須向海關呈繳中國國家銀行或上洧十叫家特許銀行結滙　書，吾則即當禁止其輸入，如此則本埠出口外匯，不難盡入特許兩行之掌握也。　　所问虛者，今後平準會按月供給之限額未必能滿足，以往入超之數，如此則次要進口頗有减少之可能，本埠商品市塲，在無法統制以前，勢將如上所論有造成少數商家獨佔利得之可能而不利於大衆，今平準會旣握有外滙予奪之權，不妨通飭特許銀行轉令結滙商家所進物品須以合理價格限額分配於本埠正當零售商家，而後者門市亦須限制　人所購數量，顧茲事體大，非可語於今日之上海耳。商業新聞美棉期貨下跌　印棉暗盤亦軟　　紐的棉市、十三日電云、先因同業睛進上漲、嗣因南方幫套買及多頭了結而回跌、結果期棉均比上日跌一至六磅音、現棉仍爲美金一角八分五厘九、（合値市擔爲三百八十五元七角一分）　　孟買棉市惟印棉電訊未到、茲據其暗盤價、俱跌三羅比七五至四羅比半、白洛區爲一百七十羅比、値市擔百零八元七角一分、奧姆辣爲一百六十二元一角四分、平果因爲一百二十五元八角一分、　　叉孟買軍、最近存棉統計、自今年九月一日起十三日止、印棉共上市四七、〇〇〇包、尙存一、二二四、〇〇〇包、加拉基共上市一二、〇〇〇包、出口二三、〇〇〇包、尙存一七七、〇〇〇包、（每包爲四百磅）銀準會今日起　變更票據交換制度　　上海銀行業聯合準備委員會前日通函各交換銀行云、本會變更定時票據交換之制、定於本年九月十五日起實行、關於各特的往來銀行託收各種票據送會時間、業已列表通函奉達在案、所有各特的往來銀行託收各種票據、務請依照「變史票據交換制度辦法」第四條之規定、在本會規定時間以內、分批陸續存入本會、庶本會收到之後、可儘速向付款行分別提示、又此事辦理伊始、諸種手續、釐訂容有未備、深冀惠予努力合作、俾臻便利、」該會又爲編定特的往來銀行中原來各委託代理交換銀行之帳號、通函各行云、茲依本會變更票據交換制度辦法第二條之規定、將本會特的往來銀行中原來委託本會代理交換銀行之帳號、編定如左、（均爲力十號冉於其下分一二三四……各號）　　一浙江地方銀行　八煤業銀行二四川美豐銀行　九恒和銀行三江蘇省農民　十　中銀行四浦東銀行　十一惇叙銀行五川康平民銀行　十二至中銀行六農商銀行　十四中和銀行七正明銀行　十五成銀行　　上述各行、此後定印各秤票據、應照右開號决、依該辦法附載之圖樣、刋印其帳號、其印已未發之票據上、應請依式製就橡皮戳、先行一律加蓋、俾本會整理票據時、易於識別』云、火柴猛跌百元　　肥皂　廠方依然無貨可派、惟各方去路極平、故人心轉軟、市面漸見下游、計固本牌肥皂每箱六十元、白祥茂皂五十二元、黃祥茂皂四十八元、均較前回降、一元至三元、　　火柴　交易微些、市氣疲乏不振、做開價較前猛跌五十元至一百元、鳳凰牌九百六十元、美麗牌一千元許、尙無人問津、</p>

<p>家庭美國第一母親  編者　　素有美國第一母親之稱的羅斯福太夫人，於本月七日逝世，全世界的人對於這一位淑德可風的　母，無不表示敬仰與哀悼。羅斯福總統的成為打破美國開國以來慣例連任三屆，固然有許多原因，然他得力於母敎，確是最大的一個　　羅斯福太夫人生前，曾經著有「我的兒子羅斯福」一書，眞是一本家庭資書，裏面有許多對於扶養羅斯福總統的記載，値得在這裏提出，以爲一般做父母者的參考。　　第一點，伊對於兒子的敎養是十分盡心的，允其注，於他的健康，所以他從誕生以後到　年時代，沒有吃過一口藥。因爲伊深信每一個做母親的人，無論是伊自己或是由別人照料孩子皆應該學習怎樣看護孩子的方法。　　伊對於自己兒子的前途，曾經說過：『在佛蘭克林的幼年時什我可會想到他的異日會做總統麼？不，我從沒有這樣想過。那末，我是抱着怎樣的願望呢？說來也很微小，只願他在長大時做一個優秀的公民。』　　伊在所著那本書中，曾經說過：『我們對於佛蘭克林並不立下許多非必要的禁條，不准他做這樣，或是那樣，但是那為他本身幸福而立的幾條規則，必須要他嚴格遵守。可是，我們從不爲了要嚴厲的原故，而表示出嚴厲的樣子。』　　如果我們再翻閱一下羅斯福總統的傳記，我們就可以知道他的父母，很能留意扶養他們的獨生子。在他五歲的時候，就給他二頭小狗，而要他負起飼食和留心的責任。從很小的年紀起，他的父母就給他很少數而有規定的余錢，並且敎他每一個錢，都應該慎重的使用。　　有一個時候，他對於弓箭，覺到非常有趣，而開始到樹林裏云導野獸。有一次他要求他的母親給他一支槍，因為他還祇有十一歲，他的母親，被他嚇了一跳，後來在只許將每一種鳥類打死一對的妥協條件之下，滿足了他的要求。　　羅斯福總統，在幼年時就有目然的態度，和富於幽默的霄詞，所以他的父母，非常疼愛他，凡是他所說的話，都加以相當的考慮，正和聽到成人所發的議論了。　　本刊的篇幅不允許我們作更詳盡的介紹，但我們深望一般母親，能够因此而鼓起伊們扶養子女的興趣。貓  靜　　家裏畜養着一頭貓，不但司以由它負起它本能的責任而作爲一種優美的點綴品，有時候它還對於我們的精神方面，有極大的幫助。　　眞正懂得安憇的人很少，可是貓却是一種眞正善於安憇的動物，當它眞想休息的時候，就把身體平舖在地上，態度是那末的自然。如果我們學着它們的樣，把神鏗安定下來，對於身體的健康，也很有裨補的。　　同時貓的體態，也是値得注意的，當它走進你的起居室的時候，它踏着安閒的步伐，把尾巴形成最適宜的角度，有時候會回頭來一望，如果一個女太太也有這種熊度，伊一定可以使人欽慕的。中國家庭的大問題—育嬰　一般家庭的錯誤  陳科美陳科美　　陳科美君，早年在美國詩家谷大學專究敎育，回國後研究敎育哲學，歷任北京大學暨南大學敎育學敎授，並任復旦大學敎育系主任，這裏山陳君提出中國家庭中的一個大問題，特爲介紹。　編者　　中國家庭過去育嬰態度旣有錯誤，只重量，而不重質；只重生，而不重養：所以育嬰的辦法也跟着錯誤，只知消極的保護，而不知積極的養育。所謂消極的保護，就是對於嬰兒保護得非常周密—過度的周密，使嬰兒的小小生命不僅得不到充分的發展，甚至妨害共發展。例如衣服。我們對於初生的嬰兒，惟恐其受凍，包紮得很緊，形似包裹；待其能穿着時，仍恐其受凍，穿着得很厚，形同木偶。這對於嬰兒身體的保護，可說趁非常的周密；但嬰兒活動的自由則完全被剝　了，這是最違反生長原則的。據生長的原則，身體愈活動，則愈發展（活動自然也有限度）；所以嬰兒的四肢百體均須有充分的活動，才能充分的發展：在襁抱時期，嬰兒的活動限於四肢的小關節，如手抓，脚踢等；待到孩提時期，則活動擴大到大的肢體，如行走拾取等。所以嬰兒的衣服總宜寬鬆輕便，不妨書身體各部的活動，然後身體才有充分的發　，包紮很緊或穿着很厚，都是與此相反的：我國兒童身體的不發達和動作的不活潑，多半是受此種錯誤影響　　又如哺乳，也是如此。我們惟恐嬰兒受餓，隨時喂乳；或恐嬰兒啼哭，以乳止之，於是，嬰兒的小胃好像一個皮球，常是裝得滿滿的；嬰兒的胃口也好像一個瓶子，常是塞得緊緊的。其結果如何呢？嬰兒的胃部沒有一刻的休息，須不斷的消化，道是最不合生理原則的。依生理的原則，身體各部器官均須運用，也均須休息，正同機器一樣：如器官不用，則趨於軟弱；如器官運用過度，則又趨於疲乏。無論是軟弱或疲乏，均可招致疾病；如就胃部而言，則易生消化不良或胃腸潰爛的毛病。所以吾人飲食須有規則，一日三餐須有定時，不能時時進食，吾則必生疾病：但這種規則的習慣，不是先天的，是後天養成的；最好在哺乳時期，就開始進行。再說嬰兒的啼哭，不是以食物可以止住的，這是消極而無良好結果的辦法；積極的辦法是尋出啼哭的原因，而將這原因消滅。嬰兒啼哭的原因是非常之多的，決不只是飢餓；如過冷，過熱，衣服過緊，身體潮濕等。如果小察啼哭的原因，祇是給他乳喫，結果必如上述，要將兒童的腸胃弄壞：我常疑心，中國患胃病的人特多，定與此種消極的哺乳辦法有相當的關係。　　此處僅舉衣食二事爲例，說明過去育嬰辦法的錯誤，不是詳論育嬰的方法；所以說得很簡單；至於詳細的討論，自有專書，無庸此處多贅。總之，過去的錯誤就是祇知消極的保護兒童，不知積極的養育兒童；以致我國的兒童，身體旣不健全，發育又不充分；最後結果是造成了東方病夫之國　　家事一得　　要使留聲機片始終發出淸晰的聲音，可以時常用肥皂和水加以洗濯。　　這裏有一個使銀器發光的方法，就是和它們放在煮過蕃薯的水裏，放一個鐘點，就可以拿出用布揩拭。　　在發育期問的兒童，需要很多的維他命，可以給他們吃維他命製劑「乃絡維」。一星期家常菜單  華英女士　　近一月來，筆奢不知如何，覺得精神萎靡，食慾减退，體重也輕了幾磅，對於本菜單有難乎爲繼之勢，曾專函編者先生另請高明，誰知編者先者却不許我卸肩，特贈九福製藥公司的九福大補素補片二瓶，據說此藥有促進神經細胞的新陳代謝作用；增進中樞神經的工作效能，加多血色素百分率和赤血球，以達到補血强身的目的。促進食欲，輔助營養，刺激腸壁，使消化機能更形活潑，而沒有其他補劑使大便閉結的缺點。筆者感激他道番厚意，即日試服，句日以來，居然精神恢復，食欲大增，坐到了餐桌上，不但葷菜覺得可口，連素菜也津津不味，確是一種效力偉大的補劑。劑。近來的菜價日漲夜大，支配很覺爲難，好在我們只要身體康健，食慾增强，如其葷菜嫌它太貴，那麼多吃些素菜，也不以爲苦的。　　星期一　　馬鈴薯燜肉　糟醋溜黃魚　甜醬炒茄子　青菜线粉湯　　星期二　　洋葱牛肉絲　干貝蛋花湯　紅燒捲心菜　茭白燜毛豆　　星期三　　冬瓜風肉湯　鹹鮝燒豆腐　油條炒蓊菜　紅燒蘿蔔片　　星期四　　番茄牛肉湯　雪菜燒鲴魚　絲瓜燒豆腐　油條黃豆芽　　星期五　　咖哩炒肉片　葱烤小鯽魚　百葉雞毛人朶　麺拖毛豆莢　　星期六　　銀芽炒雞絲　扁菩炒鱔糊　紅燒素一景　海埑蘿營絲　　星期日　　白鴨湯　煎帶魚　金花菜　炒扁豆天廠食譜（二七）（一二九）炻金錢餅　  魯擬稿　　預備…豆渣餅　猪肉　豆油　料酒　細　醬油　味精　凈白菱粉　　製法…先將猪肉刴成細末，加入料酒少許及　，醬油，味精等，用箸拌勻，豆渣餅用平刀批開，但只可批至大半，不可整個批開，菱粉用冷水調成漿蝴狀，乃將肉末輕輕嵌入豆渣餅內，隨時用菱粉封其所沘之縫口，一面把適量之豆油燒沸，然後將豆渣餅放入，炻至兩面皆黃便成，此餅旣鬆且脆，爲飲酒下飯之佳肴，豆渣餅一物，小菜塲有售，係用豆渣製成，大小銅元，的二三分厚，如有銀幣大者更妙。（一三〇）蓮花湯  周樹芬擬稿　　　預備…冬菇鮮肉鹽醬油酒味精　　製法…先將冬菇洗凈去根，用熱水浸胖，再以　　鮮肉剁　，和以適量之　，酒，醬油，味　　精等，製成同冬菇大小之肉圓，裝於冬菇　　之反而，隔水蒸熟，然後放人浸冬菇之湯　　內煮透，如湯不多，可酌量加水及鹽，湯　　之鹹淡須辨準，否則鮮味毫無。　　諸君…如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及油，鹽，醬，醋者，請撥電話「四四五九四」，常卽專差送奉，不取送力。</p>

<h3>Hull Announces: No New Progress in U.S.-Japan Talks; Testing Possibility of Resolving Pacific Issues; Exploratory Talks Deadline Expires Tomorrow</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th: Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference yesterday that there has been no new development in the U.S.-Japan talks. When asked about rumors of a fundamental agreement having been reached between Tokyo and Washington, Hull said that the talks, up to now, remain exploratory in nature, based on understanding whether negotiations to resolve Pacific issues are possible.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 14th: Reliable diplomatic sources here stated yesterday that they have learned that the United States has set a final deadline for the U.S.-Japan exploratory talks, at most extending to Tuesday. These sources also said that Washington, to prevent Japan's usual delaying tactics, has limited the talks to one month, which ends on Tuesday. Whether this period will be extended is unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, Auckland, 14th: New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, after returning from Britain and North America, gave a speech saying that U.S.-Japan talks are still in a delicate stage. However, one thing is quite clear: there will be no appeasement policy at the expense of the League of Nations. It is hoped that Japan will accept this fact. While in the U.S., he had a thorough discussion with President Roosevelt on the Pacific situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th: Japanese news agency reports that Special Advisor to the Japanese Minister Without Portfolio and Ambassador to the United States, Wakasugi, who returned to Tokyo for consultations just two weeks ago, is now scheduled to depart from Yokohama tomorrow at 3:00 PM to return to his post in Washington. As far as is currently known, there are no ships departing from Yokohama to the United States or elsewhere tomorrow, nor is there evidence of other passengers departing at the same time. However, Wakasugi's hasty return to his post may indicate that a satisfactory outcome to the U.S.-Japan talks is not entirely hopeless. Judging from the current situation, Japan's proposals and the United States' counterproposals seem to be neither entirely satisfactory nor completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Talks Undergo Three Stages; Success or Failure Remains Uncertain</p>
<p>United Press, London, 14th: The outline of an Anglo-American understanding with Japan regarding the Far East and the Pacific appeared to be taking shape yesterday. However, as the fate of the talks between Tokyo and Washington remains unresolved, the final decision remains uncertain. Observers believe that Tokyo has not made a definite decision regarding the major proposals under discussion. This discussion appears to be focused on Japan's withdrawal from central and southern China. It is heard that under consideration is Japan's guarantee not to further expand north at the expense of the Soviet Union, or to engage in aggression in the south at the expense of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Thailand. After four years of war, Japan, besides its economic desires in China and Vietnam, seems willing to give up everything else. In this regard, it seems that the democratic nations will be urged to make significant concessions, while giving due consideration to Japan's face. All of this seems to predict the recognition of Japan's special economic status in China and certain other areas of East Asia, and the lifting of all financial and commercial sanctions against Japan. The United States and Japan, in these negotiations, have received direct and important support from the Soviet Union. The United States' position on Japan is believed to have slightly strengthened because of the news that the Soviet Union has not withdrawn any of its troops and aircraft from the Far East. Reliable sources say that the Soviet Union's Far East forces remain intact in terms of manpower and materiel, and Moscow has also decided to refuse any territorial concessions to Japan, nor will it appease Tokyo. The Netherlands and Britain are now working closely with the United States in the Pacific, and China has a firm commitment to the democratic nations. According to the latest news, the Soviet Union has taken its first and special action in the Far East ABCD line, although details cannot be obtained, diplomatic sources said that they have obtained a clear background of the U.S.-Japan talks. It is said that the first stage was when Washington, before Japan occupied Vietnam, proposed that Vietnam and Thailand be made neutral, like Switzerland, but Japan refused and subsequently occupied Vietnam, so this proposal had to be abandoned. The second stage was when the United States, after Vietnam was occupied by Japan, reiterated the request, saying that if Japan withdrew from Vietnam, the United States would unfreeze Japanese assets and abolish commercial embargoes. When this news reached Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, there was great unease in Chongqing. The beginning of the third stage was when Japan, disregarding the United States' proposal, put forward its own plan, which included two main points: that Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia stop expanding their armaments, and that the United States use its position to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Foreign diplomats here said that it is astonishing that Washington did not consider subsequent measures, but agreed to conduct talks with Tokyo based on Japan's proposals. This move seems to coincide with President Roosevelt's first talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura after returning from his meeting with Churchill at sea. It is believed that Washington, in order to avoid Japan's consistent delaying tactics, has limited the talks to one month, which expires next Monday. Whether the period of the talks will be extended further is still unknown. It is said that the United States further clarified its position in August, issuing a warning to Japan to prevent it from advancing north into the Soviet Union or continuing its southward advance.</p>
<p>Japan Seeks Understanding with U.S.; Army Reorganization of Great Significance</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 14th: According to Far East observers, Japan hopes to improve relations with the United States. If negotiations fail, Japan is prepared to do its utmost to expand its hegemony in the East, or else end it all with death. Observers point out that the new centralized management of the Japanese army indicates an easing of tensions in the Pacific, but also indicates a more effective national mobilization. Some observers believe that Japan, as a result of its past policies, will not be able to extricate itself from its difficulties in today's situation. Moreover, the United States will never give up its consistent policy of Open Door and Equal Opportunity. Therefore, if Japan does not make further concessions, the current negotiations are bound to fail. Several things are worth noting: that the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria and Vietnam are not included in this army reorganization process in Tokyo, because the Japanese troops in the above-mentioned places still retain their consistent right to independent action.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Considers Arming Merchant Ships; Not Likely to Materialize Soon; President Takes Another Sea Trip</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th: Due to repeated attacks on American merchant ships, it has been proposed that merchant ships also be armed. This matter is currently under discussion, but officials stated yesterday that this move is unlikely to be implemented in the near future. Observers have learned that some members of Congress raised this issue during a recent meeting between President Roosevelt and legislative leaders at the White House. It is said that the President indicated that he would raise this request in a few days.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 14th: President Roosevelt has left here by car for Annapolis to join his yacht for a weekend cruise at sea. The President will discuss production and distribution issues with key officials from the Department of Defense and the Lend-Lease program over the weekend.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Hide in Manchuria, Awaiting Opportunity to Attack Japanese Troops; Approximately 100,000 Undergoing Austere Training</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A guerrilla leader told the United Press today that there are currently 100,000 Chinese, Korean, and Mongolian guerrillas hiding in the ancient pine forests and snow-covered mountains of Manchuria, awaiting an opportunity to attack the Japanese Kwantung Army. The leader, currently in Chongqing, said that these powerful guerrillas are now eagerly awaiting Japanese action, as they could immediately become a large-scale fifth column of the Soviet Far East Red Army. He said that these well-equipped and powerful Red Army forces within Manchuria are receiving austere training from military instructors of Soviet, Chinese, Korean, and even Japanese nationality, in accordance with Soviet Red Army and Communist doctrines. The leader also said that these guerrillas use the Soviet hammer and sickle flag as their national flag. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Gifts U.S. with Panda from Xikang</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, and Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Ai-ling, have jointly donated a panda to the United China Relief Fund organized in the United States, to express China's gratitude for the association's recent fundraising efforts to aid Chinese civilians. It is reported that the panda will later be transferred by the association to the Bronx Zoo in New York to replace one that died in May of this year. The panda was hunted by twenty hunters led by Dr. Graham, president of the West China Union University Museum, in the Himalayan mountains on the border of Xikang and Tibet. It was transported from Xikang to Chengdu, and then flown to Hong Kong. The New York Zoo has now sent a representative to Hong Kong to transport the panda donated by the two ladies to the United States via clipper ship. It will likely be exhibited in various places first, and then sent to the New York Zoo. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Establishes "Public Service Award"</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, in recognition of the wartime service spirit of officials and civilians, has specially established a medal. Those who engage in wartime service, act selflessly, brave dangers, rescue the wounded, and donate grain and money will have the facts detailed by local party and government agencies or groups, and submitted to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek for review and award. The medal is made of copper, gold-plated, with the words "Public Service" on the front and the words "Chung Cheng Medal" on the reverse. It is named the Chung Cheng Medal. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Ji'an Land Tax Changed to In-Kind Collection</h3>
<p>Ji'an: Ji'an County has decided to change the land tax to in-kind collection starting from the 20th. Procedures will be handled in accordance with the instructions of the Land Management Office, and three offices will be established to handle the matter. (14th)</p>
<h3>Jianguo Paper Mill Fully Subscribed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Jianguo Paper Mill, invested and established by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with a capital of four million yuan for Western-style papermaking, has been subscribed, with the ministry responsible for 40% and the remainder invested by the Bank of China and private individuals. Construction of the factory building is underway. Although there are many paper mills in Sichuan Province, only Longzhang makes Western-style paper. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Four Banks' Industrial and Mining Loans Specify Uses</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The 60 million yuan in industrial and mining loans from the Four Banks Joint Office will be used to encourage increased production. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now designated coal, iron, soap, and leather as the main targets. The method is for the Fuel and Steel Management Committees to purchase coal and iron, and for the Fair Price Purchase and Sales Office to purchase soap and leather. If manufacturers are unwilling to sell, they can use them as collateral for loans. Manufacturers can choose between the two options. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Issue of U.S.-Japan Talks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper discussed the discrepancies in the news regarding U.S.-Japan talks between Washington and Tokyo, stating that given the U.S. authorities' usual frankness and impartiality, there would be no reason to conceal an agreement if one were reached. According to news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull clearly denied the rumors yesterday that the U.S. and Japan had reached an agreement in principle, which shows that our view was not unfounded. Recently, Tokyo has been constantly spreading news of compromise, which is self-consolation and a smokescreen. However, the most important central issue today is not whether a compromise can be reached, but what the conditions are for the compromise. If the Japanese side can truly repent and stop all expansionist attempts, restoring the Far East to its state ten years ago, then no one would object to the reaching of such a compromise. But that is obviously impossible at present.</p>
<p>Reviewing the various statements made by the U.S. authorities regarding the Far East issue in the past month, they have adhered to their principles unchanged, strongly denying any progress in the negotiations, and have consistently remained silent on the views and basis of the negotiations. This is the source of greatest concern for the world. Of course, confidentiality is paramount in major diplomatic events. In order to dispel adverse effects, it is better to strictly maintain secrecy, as exemplified by the British authorities' handling of the Hess affair. However, regarding the current issue, although the U.S. side stated that the negotiations are still exploratory in nature, to test whether negotiations on Pacific issues are possible, the frequent and close contact between the two sides during this month is believed to be more than just a superficial discussion of general principles. It is undoubtedly that several major fundamental issues have been touched upon. To test whether negotiations are necessary or feasible is equivalent to testing whether the two sides can reach a consensus on fundamental opinions. Therefore, even if what is currently being conducted is exploratory, the conclusions reached will be as decisive for future development as formal negotiations. In this regard, so-called preliminary negotiations and formal negotiations may differ in form, but there is no significant difference in essence.</p>
<p>Under the current international situation, what any country should consider first and foremost is its own interests, which is inherently unobjectionable and should not be criticized. The United States' tough measures against Japan were triggered by Japan's conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, especially the deployment of troops in Vietnam. Therefore, what the U.S. side is considering mainly focuses on no further southward advance and withdrawal from the Axis powers. As for whether it hopes that Japan will repent and abandon the Axis powers in favor of closer ties with Britain and the United States, and is therefore willing to make some concessions, it may be too early to say at present, and it also contradicts the United States' fundamental position and promises not to adopt a policy of appeasement. However, the preliminary indications of the contents of the U.S.-Japan discussions in yesterday's United Press report from London may not be far from the truth. However, today's Far East issue is too complex. If we try to find a solution, we must make a fundamental inquiry in our understanding, and we must have comprehensive considerations in our response. The concept of short-sighted expediency will only lead to future troubles. Distorting the fundamental position of opposing aggression and upholding justice will also leave a shadow in the future of brightness and in the minds of the world. Now China's strength is rapidly increasing with the arrival of war supplies, and the Soviet Union is determined to strongly support the position of the democratic nations in the Far East. If Japan truly chooses to go to extremes (disregarding everything to expand its hegemony), then its future will only be "to end it all with death," as stated in yesterday's United Press report from Tokyo. The democratic front does not need to worry about this. The United States' implementation of embargoes and freezing of funds, in addition to the retaliatory and warning significance in its own interests, also carries a moral responsibility, which is the spirit of the declaration issued by Churchill and Roosevelt and the fundamental spirit of carrying out the war against aggression. Britain's willingness to assist Greece despite the inevitable defeat and losses, has a force that is far more compelling than the assistance that Japan's separation from the Axis powers could provide to the democratic front. Moreover, considering Japan's current situation and intentions, apart from urgently seeking to alleviate economic pressure and using its position between the two major opposing camps to assert its importance, no one can guarantee the extent of its sincerity.</p>
<p>If the reported Japanese proposals to stop expanding their military in Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia and for the U.S. to help Japan achieve peace with China are true (which is probably the contents of the Konoe letter), then it can be concluded that the U.S.-Japan talks are unlikely to be successful. China has recently declared its determination to continue fighting once again. A condition like Japanese troops withdrawing from central and southern China while Japan maintaining a special economic status in China (see the United Press London report) will only further encourage China to fight to the end. In today's Far East situation, China's attitude and direction are the most important and decisive factor, which no friendly country can afford to ignore. Moreover, even if Japan promises not to advance further south or north, it will be difficult to allay the fears of the various regions of Southeast Asia, just as the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact cannot make the Soviet Union withdraw its large army from the Far East. Therefore, we firmly believe that Hull's claim that the talks have made no progress is true. It is said that tomorrow is the deadline for the exploratory talks. If the original views of the two sides remain unchanged, if the side bent on expansion has no sincere intention of repenting, and if it is only delaying time in order to make arrangements, then the past month has already been an unnecessary waste of time, and there is no need to continue. As for the future of the Far East, if we allow it to continue developing as it was a month ago, then apart from the ambitious, no one has reason to be pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Contents of Talks Between Ping-chi Committee and Hong Kong Bankers in Hong Kong Are Important</h3>
<p>Close Financial Ties Established Between China, Britain, and the United States, Preventing Escape of Funds at Home and Abroad, and Completely Eliminating Shanghai's Black Market for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to well-informed sources here, the contents of the talks between the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and bankers from Shanghai and Hong Kong in Hong Kong are very important, mainly involving: (1) using exchange equalization work to establish close financial ties between China, Britain, and the United States; (2) encouraging exports to replenish the Exchange Equalization Fund, providing foreign exchange for the import of essential goods at any time, but this must also distinguish between urgency, and it is proposed that Britain and the United States restrict the issuance of export permits. Britain has now issued an order to prohibit all exports to China except those passing through Burma, and China has only approved sixteen types of goods to be imported through the Yunnan-Burma Road; (3) intensifying the freezing of funds in China, Britain, and the United States, preventing the escape of funds at home and abroad; (4) finding ways to completely eliminate Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange. Financial circles here believe that after the implementation of various measures, the legal tender will not be difficult to rise to three and a half pence. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Management Committee Established</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Foreign Exchange Management Committee has been established. The National Government previously appointed Minister Kung to concurrently serve as the chairman. The internal structure includes one secretary-general and two deputy secretaries-general, under whom there are four sections. The first section is responsible for reviewing foreign exchange requests for imports and remittances from government agencies; the second section is responsible for collecting foreign exchange from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, and collecting gold and silver; the third section is responsible for allocating loans and freezing funds; the fourth section is responsible for general affairs. The secretary-general, deputy secretaries-general, and personnel for each section have all been announced. In the future, the committee's work will closely coordinate with the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to jointly implement the government's foreign exchange management policy. (14th)</p>
<h3>Iqe Joo League Tugs-zsak Prays at Mausoleum of Yellow Emperor</h3>
<p>Yulin: Tuvshin Gereltsogt, the Tugs-zsak of the Iqe Joo League banner, has returned from Yubei and has now arrived in Yulin. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has sent an investigator, Chung Lu-en, to personally escort him. After Tugs-zsak met with Deng Baoshan and Zhu Shouguang in Yulin, he headed north to return to his banner. During Tugs-zsak's return from Xi'an to Yulin, he personally prayed at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor in central China, with a solemn ceremony. It is said that Tugs-zsak is the first Mongol prince to pray at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, and Tugs-zsak is also a Jilang responsible for the offering at the Genghis Khan mausoleum. His praying at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor has great significance. (13th)</p>

<h3>Red Army Gains Initiative on Central Front; 16 German Divisions Annihilated</h3>
<p>Corpses Litter Bryansk Region; German Stuka Dive Bombers Bombing Leningrad</p>
<p>German War Report Claims Breakthrough in St. Petersburg Defenses</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 14th: News from the front yesterday reported that the Red Army annihilated twelve German divisions attacking in Bryansk and destroyed four German divisions attempting to attack Kiev. News reports published a statement by General Duller Lossdorf, stating that four German divisions were annihilated in the Kiev conflict in February, and the operation is continuing. General Dulles said that the fighting reached its peak from August 8 to August 14, when the German army added the 44th and 95th divisions to the 71st and 299th divisions. A reporter at the front said, "The German army also implemented Stalin's scorched earth policy when withdrawing from the Bryansk region." The reporter said, "The German army destroyed bridges, burned towns, and slaughtered all living things. At night, the fire lit up the sky, as the forests and towns along several miles were burned by them. Thousands of German corpses were buried in a public pit. The battlefield was covered with destroyed tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft. Near the village of M, the German motorcycle corps abandoned valuable maps, including a map of Moscow." According to the latest official news, fierce fighting is continuing in the Smolensk region. The German army is counterattacking in individual areas, attempting to recapture this position. The Soviet Union has stopped the German offensive and, after repeated counterattacks, has captured the village of Stivolov.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 14th: Reliable German sources stated yesterday that General Leeb's northern forces have intensified the encirclement of Leningrad's defensive positions. The German Air Force is constantly bombing the Soviet lines, clearing the way for ground troops. These reliable sources said that Leningrad experienced the most severe air raid on Friday morning. It is claimed that German Stuka dive bombers scattered "whirlwind fire" on the outer positions of the city.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Fuehrer Headquarters, 14th: The German High Command announced that the German army is continuing to advance on the Eastern Front. Elite German troops have passed through the Leningrad fortified line and charged into enemy positions. German General Schobert was killed in action on the Eastern Front on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The German High Command announced today that the German army has broken through St. Petersburg's strong defensive works and charged into enemy positions.</p>
<h3>Amid Tense Situation on Eastern Front, British Air Force Aids Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: In recent weeks, British aircraft piloted by Soviet aviators have been active on the front lines. Germany is now using its latest Messerschmitt Me 109F fighters in the offensive against Leningrad. Although it rained heavily yesterday, the air war continued, with reportedly heavy German losses.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: A Reuters air force correspondent claims that it has been announced today that a large squadron of the British Air Force has arrived in the Soviet Union, providing direct assistance to the Soviet Air Force at a time of heightened tension on the Eastern Front. Regarding Prime Minister Churchill's statement in Parliament last week that hundreds of British warplanes had been sent to the Soviet Union, and that some had already arrived, there is now reason to believe that this squadron may be entirely composed of fighters, including all combat and management personnel. The exact details are, of course, inconvenient to disclose during wartime. At the beginning of the Battle of France, each British Air Force combat squadron consisted of two teams, but this has since been increased. There is also no information about who is leading the squadron to the Soviet Union. The speed at which the British Air Force operates on the Soviet front lines may be a decisive factor in the victory of the war in the region.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: First Sea Lord Alexander said in Nottingham today that there are many ways to provide naval assistance to the Soviet Union, but he did not intend to provide details in order to avoid being used by the enemy. The Soviet Union is our ally, and we will provide it with assistance in every possible form without reservation.</p>
<h3>Military and Civilians Resolve to Defend to the Death: Kiev Becomes a Strong Fortress</h3>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, London: Recent Soviet communiqués state that fierce battles are occurring along the front lines. It is also stated that on the night of September 12th, Kiev was bombarded by the Soviets. According to Reuters in Moscow, after the capture of Chernihiv (approximately 80 miles northeast of Kiev) in northern Ukraine by the German forces, Kiev becomes an even more important location to secure the western front. The area between Kiev and Chernihiv, specifically the southern Polesia region, is mostly forest and swamp, bordering the Ukrainian steppe. This area receives heavy rainfall, and the rivers are currently very full. Kiev itself remains confident that it will not fall to the enemy. In early August, enemy forces had approached Kiev but were eventually repelled. This experience has instilled a determination to defend the city among the troops and residents. Battles have been ongoing for several weeks on the roads leading to Kiev, but under the guidance of technicians and military experts, the 800,000 residents of Kiev have worked to turn Kiev and its surrounding areas into a large fortress during the war.</p>
<h3>Fierce Resistance Encountered on All Fronts: German Strategic Objectives Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, London: The special correspondent for Reuters in Moscow reports that the situation in the Smolensk area has stabilized after the German forces attempted to break through the Soviet lines and advance toward Moscow but were defeated by General Timoshenko. The initiative has now shifted to the Soviet forces. General Timoshenko's troops are numerous and well-equipped. While the Germans are concentrating in the south and in the Leningrad area, the Soviets are launching counterattacks in the Smolensk area. The Soviet side believes the situation is very satisfactory. The Germans are currently reinforcing the areas they occupy with artillery and machine guns, but the Soviet forces have still made significant progress on this front. At the same time, the Soviet forces are increasing their activity in the areas slightly to the north to coordinate with the Soviet forces in Smolensk, aiming to prevent the Germans from using the main railway lines behind their lines to transport troops into the Leningrad area. Leningrad also has a large garrison, and its residents are determined to resist, so it is expected to hold out for as long as Odessa. The weather has been unfavorable since the beginning of September, but there are still unprecedented large-scale battles taking place south and southwest of Leningrad. Newly established German airfields have been attacked and destroyed by the Soviet forces, and the Soviet Baltic Fleet has also inflicted heavy blows on the German forces. The strength of the Soviet military is evident here. Both soldiers and civilians are deeply confident that the German forces will not be able to capture Leningrad. Now the German forces have opened another route, advancing from southeast of Gomel. The Soviet forces attempted to directly attack Bryansk half a month ago, but their tank columns were mostly destroyed, resulting in failure. Therefore, they have opened a new route to try again. After the fall of Chernihiv, if the German forces can occupy the salient points of the Dnieper River and the Desna River, Kiev will be at risk of encirclement. However, the Desna River flows through swampy areas, and in the current climate, it is impossible to advance to Kiev from the northeast, and crossing the Desna River is also not easy.</p>
<h3>American Ship Injured by Bombing on the Banks of the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>Washington Announces Hit by Shrapnel; Bombing of the "Steel Mariner" Confirmed as German Aircraft</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: The State Department announced that on Thursday, the American-flagged ship "Archisan" was slightly damaged by shrapnel during an air raid in the town of Suez. No casualties were reported among the crew. The American authorities are currently investigating the details. This ship is owned by the American Hawaiian Company and travels between the United States and the Red Sea. The American Embassy in Cairo reported to the State Department that the ship was hit by shrapnel from a shell, and some of the ship's plates were pierced by fragments. The ship left New York on July 19th, arrived in Port Sudan on September 5th, and departed Suez on the 8th. The crew consists of thirty-eight people, including thirty-six Americans, one Briton, and one Dutchman. As to whether the shrapnel came from anti-aircraft guns, aerial torpedoes, or cannons fired from aircraft, the report did not specify. The State Department stated that personnel at the American Embassy in Cairo, who are not military experts, said that these fragments might be bomb fragments rather than shell fragments, but this is not certain.</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: According to the testimony of Second Mate Sujia of the American ship "Steel Mariner" in Suez on Friday, the ship was sunk by a German aircraft in the Red Sea on the night of September 9th. The aircraft was most likely a Junkers Ju 88, and it was definitely a German aircraft, not an Italian one. He also said that the night had bright moonlight, and it was not difficult to distinguish the flag flown by the "Steel Mariner."</p>
<h3>Australian Aircraft Production: 1,000 Aircraft Can Be Produced by the End of the Year</h3>

<h3>United States Intensifies Efforts to Supplement National Defense Programs</h3>
<p>Transportation to the Far North Sky Can Be Reached in Three Days; Air Route Opened Between the United States and West Africa</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: Government officials revealed the following developments in national defense programs: (1) Army air transport is being used to accelerate the delivery of national defense supplies to American outposts in Alaska. The supplies and equipment needed by the far north base can now be transported from the United States to Alaska in three days, instead of the several weeks required by water transport. (2) Pan American Airways is planning to establish new flight bases and bomber transition lines in Africa to counter actions from Dakar, West Africa, to the Western Hemisphere. (3) Bases are currently being built in Monrovia, Liberia, West Africa, and Léopoldville, Belgian Congo. This will be a new route for delivering American-made bombers to the Soviet Union and British forces in the Middle East. Pan American Airways will operate the route from Miami to Léopoldville using government equipment. (4) The Navy Department has recently joined the effort to allocate national defense orders to various factories. The department has established a special office to handle order allocation. (5) The large-caliber shells manufactured by Pullman Standard Car Manufacturing Company have now been completed. A few months ago, the factory only needed one warehouse, but now it has rapidly become a shell manufacturing plant. (6) A new aluminum plant will be built in Tacoma, Washington, producing 20 million pounds of aluminum per year, bringing the total annual aluminum production in the United States to 113 million pounds. The construction cost of this plant is $3.9 million, and it has been approved by the National Defense Factories Association. (7) Manganese plants owned by the National Factories Association will be built in two locations in the United States, so that the annual manganese production in the United States can reach 27.4 million pounds.</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: A new commercial air route will be established between the United States and Southwest Africa. The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Authority has been authorized by President Roosevelt to issue an operating permit. Aircraft on this route will travel between Miami, Florida, and a location in Southwest Africa.</p>
<h3>Another American 30,000-Ton Battleship Completed</h3>
<p>Two-Ocean Navy Program Expected to Be Completed Early</p>
<p>Havas, 14th Dispatch, Washington: The newly built American 35,000-ton battleship "Massachusetts" has been completed and is scheduled to be launched on the 23rd of this month. Its completion date is seven months ahead of schedule. Navy personnel believe that if shipbuilding work can continue at this pace, the "Two-Ocean Navy" can be completed in 1944, two years ahead of schedule. After the "Massachusetts" is incorporated into the fleet, the United States will have as many as nineteen battleships in active service. The ship cost $75 million and is equipped with nine 16-inch guns and twenty 5-inch guns, making it the most powerful battleship of modern times, with a speed of 27 knots per hour.</p>

<h3>British and Soviet Troops Celebrate Together in Iran</h3>
<p>First Batch of Arrested German Nationals Handed Over to British and Soviet Military Custody</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Tehran: A unit of British Indian troops, led by the commander of the British advance team, formally visited the Soviet forces stationed in Qazvin yesterday. The British Minister to Iran and the Army Attaché also went there and were received by the Soviet commander. Within a week, the Soviet commander will also go to Hamadan to return the visit to the British forces.</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Tehran: The first batch of eighty Germans in Iran left here by train on Friday. Seventy-two of them were handed over to British military custody, and the rest were handed over to Soviet military custody. Another 170 Germans will also be handed over to the British and Soviet sides within days. However, not all the Germans demanded by the British and Soviets may be handed over, as many of them have escaped from Iran or taken refuge in the mountains.</p>
<h3>American Sailors Strike, Demanding Wartime Compensation</h3>
<p>Service on the Atlantic-West Indies Route Halted</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th Dispatch, New York: Three ships loaded with supplies for the establishment of American defense bases in Bermuda and the West Indies were scheduled to depart yesterday afternoon but were temporarily canceled because the North American International Seafarers' Union demanded full war compensation and announced a strike. The crew members left the ships, preventing them from departing on time. The union secretary, Creskin, said that all ships sailing to Axis or Allied ports will be affected by this labor unrest. We do not object to transporting war materials to the UK, but since the Nazis are now indiscriminately attacking ships regardless of location, we have to protect ourselves. The shipowners have not yet made any moves to negotiate.</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Continues to Suppress the Enemy in the Dayun Mountains, Recaptures Strongholds such as Heshang Village</h3>
<p>Chinese Army in Northern Hubei Attacks Japanese Positions with Gains; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Raids Fenlingdu, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Japanese</p>

<p>Miluo: The Japanese forces attempting to invade Dayun Mountain were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese on all sides, suffering extremely heavy casualties. One group of Japanese forces retreated towards Zhongfang and Taolin, while another group fled along the southern foothills of the mountain. The Chinese army has captured Dayun Mountain and is encircling and annihilating the Japanese forces fleeing along the southern foothills.

<p>Dayun Mountain is a Natural Guerrilla Base</p>
<p>Miluo: Dayun Mountain is the western branch of the Mufu Mountains, running through the eastern shore of Dongting Lake, in the middle of the Yueyang and Linxiang counties. With a circumference of more than 200 li and 72 peaks, equal in number to the peaks of Mount Heng in Southern Yue, it is a natural model guerrilla base. During the Northern Hunan Campaign years ago, General Shao Jiang Zongyi of the 79th Army pursued the Japanese army and climbed to the summit several times. Liang Gaisan and Zongyi once wrote a quatrain. Zongyi's quatrain says, "The water and cloud village on the shore of Dongting Lake, the people are scattered and dead after the disaster. After the battle, the mouths of slaves were first stationed, and the flying rain filled the mountains, passing through the Double Ninth Festival." This time, thousands of Japanese soldiers were injured and invaded the mountain, but in less than four days, they were once again captured by the Chinese army. According to a certain officer who first entered the mountain speaking to a reporter by telephone, the scene in the mountains after the war was no different from the previous poem. Documents seized from the Japanese years ago confirmed that the Japanese viewed the Dayun Mountains in northern Hunan as being no less important than the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. The Zhongtiao Mountains were the Japanese appendix, and the Dayun Mountains were the Japanese tonsils. Gaining them both would be enough to control the Japanese's lives. (Dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in North China Implementing Invasion of Communist Army</h3>
<p>Attempt to Defeat the Communist Forces on the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Within the Year; Fierce Battles Have Begun But Are Being Blocked Everywhere</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Communist Party, stated today that 100,000 Japanese and puppet troops, in order to defeat the Chinese Communist forces on the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border within this year, began an unprecedentedly large-scale mopping-up operation on August 14, but were blocked everywhere.

The area originally had 50,000 Japanese soldiers, and then 50,000 more were sent as reinforcements, hoping to launch a fierce attack on the border area from five directions, namely Lingqiu to the north of Fangshan, Zhuoxian to the east of Zhengding and Shijiazhuang, Qingcheng (transliteration) to the south, and Wutai to the west. The Communist Party predicts that although the attacks by the Japanese army on all sides will be blocked, there will soon be even greater blood battles and terrible massacres.

<h3>The Concession Authorities Decide to Monitor Prices</h3>
<h3>Prices Cannot Be Raised Arbitrarily, and Must Be Reduced Automatically</h3>
<p>The various commodity prices in Shanghai have been rising one after another due to the surge in the black market exchange rate and the soaring gold prices. However, since the collapse of the gold market, apart from a slight drop in rice managed by the Public Works Department, the remaining goods have stubbornly maintained their new prices and have not been reduced proportionally. This has resulted in citizens only facing the threat of price increases, without enjoying any price decreases. The authorities in the two concessions, seeing the merchants valuing profit over righteousness and disregarding people's livelihood, have decided to adopt strict monitoring measures in the future. The rise and fall of selling prices must be based on market conditions and the impact on the industry itself. Prices cannot be raised arbitrarily without automatic reductions, so as to avoid increasing the burden on citizens.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ships Exporting Military Supplies</h3>
<h3>Customs Denies, But Admits to Carrying Coal and Cotton Fabrics</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Jianghai Customs recently stated that regarding the two Soviet ships that set sail from Shanghai to Vladivostok last Tuesday and Friday, there were rumors circulating that they were carrying wartime military supplies for the use of the Soviet government. The spokesman denied this. However, the spokesman admitted that the two Soviet ships were only carrying coal, cotton fabrics, and ordinary commercial goods. The customs spokesman also did not specify the names of the Soviet ships, possibly referring to the *Soviet Tuohao* and *Food Industry Hao*.

<h3>*Jin Tai Zi* Ship Attempts to Sail to Wenzhou</h3>
<h3>Suddenly Detained by the Japanese</h3>
<h3>Declaration to Sail to Hong Kong Revealed</h3>
<h3>Negotiations with Foreign Businesses Have Not Yet Secured Release</h3>
<p>The coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese Navy in mid-July last year. More than two months have passed, and shipping between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian has been cut off. Last month, foreign ships *Da Xin* and *Da Li* attempted to sail to Gu'aotou. As previously reported, the trial voyages of these two small ships were also secret operations and not made public. Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs is still prohibiting clearance for Zhejiang and Fujian ports. However, small ships have recently been secretly sailing to eastern Zhejiang. Now, Yuanfeng Customs Brokerage, last month, chartered a small foreign ship named *Jin Tai Zi* (Cambay Prince) of 375 tons in Hong Kong through Aik Ocean Shipping Company. The ship loaded more than 2,400 bags of foreign rice in Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of last month. It was unloaded at the Jiangmao Wharf in Pudong. After the foreign rice was unloaded, the ship was handled by Kangtai Customs Brokerage, Dachang Shenzhuang, No. 102, Central Huibuilding, which took over the export cargo and secretly loaded it. On the 8th of this month, it declared to customs that it would sail to Hong Kong and was scheduled to depart the next evening (9th). Unexpectedly, the plan was leaked and discovered by the Japanese Navy Maritime Police. Before the ship could set sail, it was detained and inspected by Japanese soldiers. The ship was loaded with more than 2,000 pieces of gauze and had 11 passengers. After strict interrogation by the Japanese soldiers, the passengers admitted that they were traveling to Wenzhou. Therefore, the Japanese military police believed that there was conclusive evidence that the ship was secretly sailing to Wenzhou. The ship was placed under strict surveillance and investigation. After the company learned that the ship had an accident, it immediately sought the help of foreign businesses to negotiate and find ways to get it released. A week has passed, but there have been no results. The ship is still being detained at the Longmao Wharf. It is reported that Kangtai Customs Brokerage is jointly operated by Sun Bofu, Tong Ziquan, Ren Changlin, and others. Since the ship had an accident, Ren has avoided appearing. The company's terms for reporting and loading cargo for customers are very harsh. If the ship does not leave the wharf, a 20% water fee will be charged for future customs returns. If the ship leaves the wharf but cannot leave Wusongkou, a 30% water fee will be charged. If the ship leaves Wusongkou but cannot reach its destination and returns, a 50% water fee will be charged. Therefore, although the ship has been detained, the company's losses are minimal, while the customer's losses are significant.</p>
<h3>More Than 1,000 Members of the Shanghai Sichuan Guild Pay Tribute to Wang Dan Kui Yesterday</h3>
<h3>The Ceremony Was Extremely Solemn and Reverent; He Was Posthumously Honored as Duke Wenk</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Dankui, a respected elder statesman from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, passed away on the 23rd day of the fifth lunar month of this year at the age of 82. Friends respected his virtue and integrity, and more than 30 organizations, including the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fellow Association and the World Red Swastika Society, initiated a memorial service to express their condolences. Since the preparations began, everything has been proceeding smoothly. A memorial service was held yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the grand auditorium on the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Association. More than 1,500 people attended, including Yuan Xiluo, Huang Jingwan, and Jin Qiyuan.</p>
<h3>The Grand Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Wen Lanting, Shen Qiquan, Tang Wenzhi, Shen Xinqing, and Zhang Yunbo were elected as the presidium. The auditorium was decorated simply and solemnly. In the center hung a portrait of Mr. Wang, who appeared spirited despite his advanced age. On both sides hung plain elegiac couplets presented by various circles. Several bouquets of fresh flowers and simple sacrifices of fruits and vegetables were placed on the altar, along with lit white candles. Several wreaths were placed in front of the stage. At exactly 2 PM, mourning music began to play. Wen Lanting delivered the opening remarks, followed by the memorial ceremony. Everyone stood in solemn respect as the chairman offered incense, wine, and flowers. The assembly bowed three times and read the eulogy. Lu Zhuoqiao reported on Mr. Wang's life, divided into (1) Family History, (2) Scholarship, (3) Ambitions and Actions, (4) Achievements in the Court, (5) Accomplishments in Retirement, (6) Civil Service Examination Success, (7) Official Rank, (8) Writings, (9) Age, and (10) Descendants. Yao Minghui, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Tang Moubo, Zhang Lancui and others delivered condolences. Organizations such as the Songtao Fellow Association, the World Red Swastika Society, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fellow Association, the Chengming College of Arts, and Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi Fellow Associations, the Chongming Fellow Association and other groups offered sacrifices in separate groups. Finally, Wang Yuqiao, a member of the Wang family, delivered a speech of thanks and posthumously honored him as Duke Wenke. The ceremony concluded at 5 PM and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Tang's Eulogy</h3>
<p>On the 14th day of the 9th month of the 30th year of the Republic of China, in the year of Xin Si, Shen Enfu, Tang Wenzhi, Shen Zhou, Xia Yueao, Dai Sigong, Huang Yunshu, Min Huan, Zhu Dechuan, Yuan Xiluo, Yu Zhongtang, Lu Xiuhao, Gao Xie, Dai Kekuan, Jin Chengwang, Zhang Zhihe, Jin [blank] Yuan, Jia Fengzhen, Li Shilong, Yao Minghui, Xia Benli, Wu Bangzhen, Xiang Zhenfang, Ni Guangyao, Hu Duanxing, Zhang [blank] Yan, Pan Guangyu, Cheng Hao, Shen Siqi, Shi Tongren, Ge Cun [blank], Sun Deyu, and Zhou Chengxin, residing in Shanghai and returning to Songtao, respectfully offer sacrifices to the spirit of Mr. Wang Dan Kui, saying: Alas, tracing back the lineage of the Du family, its origins are distant and its flow is long. Endowed with the spirit of Fu and Yu, its jade-like qualities are hidden and treasured. Mr. Wang was devoted to filial piety and brotherly love, with broad knowledge and a strong memory, indeed commendable. He was respectful and gentle, rarely laughing and always solemn. Recalling his early years, he attained high honors in the imperial examination, how he aspired to the heavens and soared. But the smog of rebellion obscured the sky, lamenting the thorny path filled with dangers. Serving his parents, he fled to Bao Dili, then returned alone to the capital to assist the imperial court. Observing the cycle of prosperity and decline, he expanded his grand strategy for governing the world, embracing extraordinary measures and sounding the alarm, spreading beneficial commercial policies, establishing chambers of commerce to facilitate business, and connecting distant lands. He forged ties with overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, saying that only Mr. Wang could alleviate their worries. He entrusted him with the most important matters, but alas, he was deceived and betrayed. Furthermore, longing for home, he was forced to live a recluse life by the riverside, washing his mouth and using a stone as a pillow. Mr. Wang was upright and impartial, hoping for timely rain to nourish the land. Overseeing the finances of Zhejiang, he eliminated corruption and established a clean and tight system, vehemently protesting against road administration, lamenting the blockage and destruction. He foresaw hidden dangers, and indeed, dikes collapsed and cliffs crumbled. Alas, lamenting that Mr. Wang did not serve again, how can we comfort the people? Managing the vast floods of Huai and Xiang, he initiated the plan to guide the Huai River. He rode on sleds and struggled, nearly drowning in the middle of the water. Coordinating the dredging of the Zhenze Lake, he exhausted his efforts and ingenuity. Mr. Wang was tireless in his love for others, providing disaster relief in his hometown. Supporting the sickbed and groaning, he still continued to give generously. Grieving over the hardships of the nation, his sorrow lingered and could not be forgotten. Daily, he looked up and wiped away tears, hoping for a clear world. Although knowing to hide his talents and await opportunities, he only appealed to save our four directions. Wise men are fading, who shall be our model? For thousands of years, my thoughts linger. Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice! (Written by Tang Wenzhi)</p>
<h3>The Bridge at Daozhen Road in the Island Garrison</h3>
<h3>Completely Demolished</h3>
<h3>American Defense Forces Also Withdraw</h3>
<p>The Wuzhen Road Bridge, which connects the Public Concession's Xin Zha Road and Zhabei, was partially demolished in May of this year by the Concession authorities because the bridge was old and heavily damaged. However, recently, for some unknown reason, the bridge piers in the river were also completely demolished. The American defense forces originally stationed at the bridge have also been withdrawn.</p>
<h3>New York Opera House Performs to</h3>
<h3>Raise Funds for Refugees</h3>
<p>The Concert Division of the United Association for Chinese Relief in America recently organized an opera to raise funds for Chinese refugees. They invited well-known figures from the cultural and musical circles of New York to form an opera committee, with Mrs. Mo Mauri and two others as chairpersons. Famous singers Ms. Hua Fan and Zhen Baike also served as committee members. Many noble ladies, social stars, etc., from New York also joined the preparations. It is now scheduled to perform the famous Italian opera "Rigoletto" at the Triboro Stadium Civic Opera House on the 20th of this month. The actors will include renowned performers Martinelli as the Duke and Pan Wenyi as Gerda. Tickets range from 50 cents to $1.50. It is also reported that the United States is planning to send a medical delegation to China, consisting of 16 representatives. Their mission is to care for the health and hygiene of 250,000 workers building the railway from Lashio, Burma, to Xukong, China. They have allocated $1.15 million under the Lend-Lease Act to support the delegation. The delegation, named the "Burma-China Railway Medical Delegation," is scheduled to arrive in China this fall and stay for one year.</p>
<h3>Liquor Merchants Request Exemption from</h3>
<h3>Bottled Liquor Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Shanghai liquor industry, due to the French Concession Public Works Bureau's recent promulgation of regulations on alcohol and beverage factories and distilleries, is widely collecting bottled liquor stamp tax from members of the trade association. They have exchanged views, believing that the liquor tax is a national tax and is different in nature from other local taxes. The repackaged bottled liquor sold by member stores is repackaged from large containers of goods. This is a commercial packaging act, not self-made, and cannot be called a factory. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting that it revoke the order and exempt them from reapplying stamp tax.</p>
<h3>Russian Malotof</h3>
<h3>Ambushed</h3>
<h3>Shot in the Left Abdomen</h3>
<p>Russian Malotof, 47 years old, resides at No. 5, Lane 1248, Lafayette Road, and operates the New China Trading Company at No. 310, Huanlong Road. At around 7:00 PM last night, Malotof went out from his home and was about to board a rickshaw at the entrance of the lane when a person wearing a black gown suddenly appeared beside him, holding a pistol, and opened fire without asking any questions. Malotof was shot in the left abdomen and immediately fell to the ground. When the nearby patrolmen arrived upon hearing the alarm, the assailant had already fled. Malotof was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Because the bullet hit a vital area, his condition is very critical. The police are investigating the reason for the shooting.</p>
<h3>Silver Association Implements Today</h3>
<h3>Regular Exchange of Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<h3>All Exchange Banks and Agent Banks</h3>
<h3>Are Referred to as Special Contract Banks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Committee, referring to the regular exchange system of the London Clearing House and using the collection method as a system for unifying negotiable instrument exchange, will implement it from today (Monday). All original exchange banks and entrusted exchange banks will be referred to as special contract banks.</p>
<h3>Symbol</h3>
<p>All special contract banks should print various negotiable instruments in the future. The account number "50" of the clearing house should be printed on the negotiable instruments in large red double-hook Arabic numerals, surrounded by a single-line circle. This pattern should be printed in the lower right corner of Chinese negotiable instruments and in the upper right corner of English negotiable instruments. However, each bank may freely decide to print it in other appropriate locations on the negotiable instrument. All negotiable instruments entrusted to this Joint Reserve Committee for collection should be stamped on the front by the collecting bank.</p>
<h3>Stamp</h3>
<p>The "Entrusted to Shanghai Negotiable Instrument Clearing House for Collection" stamp issued by the association should be stamped in green ink, indicating the date and with the number 50 below. This stamp is limited to payment instruments of special contract banks and payment checks of the association. It has the same effect as endorsement and parallel lines for withdrawal. The original scheduled exchange will be discontinued from today. "Delivery of Instruments", "Return of Instruments", and "Transfer", and "Balance Supplement" have already been issued to all special contract banks in Circulars No. 173 and No. 173 for compliance.</p>
<h3>Three Major American Gasoline Companies</h3>
<h3>Further Restrict Oil Use</h3>
<h3>All Gas Stations Close Early at 8 PM</h3>
<h3>Cars Must Be Registered Before Refueling Is Allowed</h3>
<p>The *Times* reports that Asia Petroleum has announced further restrictions on the consumption of gasoline by cars, stipulating that all gas stations in various sections of the city will close at 8 PM. The other two gasoline companies have also taken the same steps. In addition, gas stations will only sell gasoline to regular customers. According to Texaco's regulations, car owners must register at a certain gas station and can only obtain the required gasoline from that station. Recently, Asia Petroleum warned its customers that the quantity of gasoline needed from each "Shell" gas station should not exceed the average quantity of the previous few months. In addition to regular customers, gasoline sales, whether paid in cash or on credit, will be suspended. The Mobil Oil Company also uses this system to allocate gasoline.</p>
<h3>Cash Purchase of Oil</h3>
<p>The only difference is that credit sales are stopped, but cash purchases can continue. Cars must also be registered at the gas station. If a car's oil consumption exceeds the prescribed allocation, the gas station will stop supplying until the first day of the following month. The oil companies claim that these steps are taken not because of a shortage of gasoline reserves or reduced sources, but to prevent speculators from hoarding. This hoarding can harm ordinary car owners because it can increase prices. With the implementation of these measures, the price of oil is expected to fall. In addition, gasoline, as an imported item, can obtain foreign exchange at a preferential rate of National Currency $8.82 per US dollar, so gasoline prices are expected to fall. However, responsible parties say that this development is unlikely in the short term.</p>

<h3>Police in Both Concessions</h3>
<h3>Crack Down on Extortion Gang</h3>
<h3>Leader "Little Korean" Arrested in Western Shanghai</h3>
<h3>More Than 30 Gang Members Arrested in Various Hotels</h3>
<p>Recently, various large and small cinemas in Shanghai have been repeatedly threatened by gangsters throwing bombs and extorting "protection money". Although three gang members were arrested in Pudong a month ago, there are still a large number of these gangsters at large, and they continue their terrorist extortion activities. The authorities in both concessions are paying close attention to this. After much investigation, the leader of the terror group, nicknamed "Little Korean," was arrested in Western Shanghai. Based on his confession, the police in both concessions cooperated and arrested 30 gang members from major hotels such as Dongya, Datong, and Huizhong from the afternoon of the day before yesterday until 3:00 AM yesterday. They are currently being held in the police stations of both concessions for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Bombing and Extortion</h3>
<p>The French Concession, due to the bombing of cotton shops such as Baoda Xiang on Kai Zi'er Road and Weida Xiang on Ningxing Street, as well as the Lafayette Theatre, by gangsters attempting to extort money and disrupt security, has ordered its subordinates to investigate and punish the perpetrators to ensure peace for the residents. Recently, through the efforts of police officers from the Criminal Division of the French Police, the location of the suspects was discovered. On the morning of the day before yesterday (13th), detectives were dispatched in groups to various locations where the gang members were hiding, and 22 gang members were arrested.</p>
<h3>A Clean Sweep</h3>
<p>It is also reported that some documents were seized. The search was completed at 9:00 PM that evening. It is also reported that the gang leader was arrested in the Western Shanghai area, so the gang has been completely eliminated. All 22 arrested suspects are currently being interrogated one by one. The police department will officially announce the results after the investigation is completed. It is also reported that two of the arrested people were found to be unrelated and were released on bail.</p>
<h3>People's Organizations in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Reach Over 700 Units</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, although some mass organizations in Shanghai have changed or stopped operating, some industrial and commercial organizations and gangs have maintained their original state. At the same time, due to the circumstances, charitable organizations have increased, and trade associations in various industries have strengthened their organizations due to the abnormal development of various industries. According to investigations, as of recently, there are more than 700 units of organizations in all sectors. There are more than 230 in the commercial field, more than 260 in industrial and commercial organizations, more than 20 in educational organizations, more than 10 in charitable organizations, more than 60 in public welfare organizations, and dozens of other organizations, including hometown associations, religious groups, and gangs.</p>

<p>In Room 29 of the Yong'an Hotel at No. 8, Lane 27, Fujian Road, at 6:30 PM yesterday, four travelers hired Liang Baofen (18 years old, from Hangzhou), an escort girl from Taotao Escort Agency. Not long after, the four people stuffed her mouth with cotton wool, tied her hands to a chair, and robbed her of a gold ring and watch, estimated to be worth $300. Afterwards, the four people fled with the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Two Major Temples</h3>
<p>The famous ancient temples of Longhua and Jing'an in Shanghai have recently had a serious dispute due to monks competing for status. They have either published articles attacking each other in newspapers or have drawn in backstage figures to rely on. The Buddhist community is supposed to be pure, but now it is filled with smoke and chaos, which makes people in society feel disgusted. It is now heard that although the Buddhist Association cannot publicly stop it due to the environment, it will order the organizers to quickly stop the dispute in a private capacity, so as not to be ridiculed by society.</p>

<h3>From Freezing to Management</h3>
<h3>The Before and After of Black Market Foreign Exchange Changes (Part 1)</h3>
<h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>Since the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds, followed by the Junior Council's management of the black market, with a gap of less than two months in between, the foreign exchange market has been turbulent and unpredictable, changing in an instant. These novel events are not only unprecedented changes in Chinese financial history but are also rare and unheard of in the black markets of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and South American countries. In view of this, the author will record the changes in the black market during this stage and the causes and consequences before and after, so that readers can get a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>
<h3>(1) The Status of Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>The establishment of a foreign exchange market is used to settle international lending relationships. Therefore, the level of the exchange rate completely depends on whether the international balance of payments can maintain equilibrium for a long period of time. Although the Shanghai foreign exchange market has added political and military factors to the fluctuations in the exchange rate due to changes in the environment, analyzing the changes in the exchange rate over time shows that the surplus or deficit of foreign exchange receipts and payments is still the basic key to determining the exchange rate. What is the situation of Shanghai's receipts and payments? Due to the lack of reliable statistics from all parties, the actual situation of the entire receipts and payments cannot be investigated. However, if we look at Shanghai's import and export trade, which accounts for the main part of international receipts and payments, Shanghai's foreign exchange receipts and payments undoubtedly cannot maintain equilibrium. Its economic capacity is not enough to prevent the exchange rate from falling. Taking this year's trade situation as an example, according to the national currency value of the monthly trade deficit in Shanghai issued by the Customs, the total has reached more than 988.8 million yuan in national currency over the past seven months, with an average monthly deficit of 140 million yuan in national currency. That is to say, the Shanghai foreign exchange market must lose an average of 140 million yuan in national currency per month. Where will this huge monthly deficit be compensated from? There is no doubt about that. In the past, the escape of world capital to Shanghai was only a momentary matter. Remittances from overseas Chinese back to China were subject to quota restrictions due to foreign exchange controls in various places. These two sources of foreign exchange cannot be regarded as regular income, and their amount is insignificant to the entire market. In the past, the Chinese government adopted a policy of trying its best to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market. It made many efforts to maintain the black market exchange rate. The Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund, for example, was completely spent on the Shanghai black market. However, the black market is ultimately a bottomless loophole. Unlimited maintenance would only increase the government's burden. The government had to tighten its grip on the Shanghai foreign exchange market. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange market was neither economically self-sufficient nor supported by the government, and its status became increasingly fragile. The continuous decline in the exchange rate was an inevitable trend.</p>
<h3>(2) Prelude to the Freezing of Funds</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European War in April 1940, the United States began to implement its freezing measures. The first to bear the brunt was the freezing of funds in the United States of Denmark and Norway. Subsequently, as the German-occupied areas gradually expanded, the number of countries frozen also increased day by day. As of June 14, there were a total of 22 countries. At that time, the United States did not have an immediate intention to freeze funds in the Far East. However, rumors about freezing Chinese and Japanese funds came one after another, and reports were endless. The reflection in the hearts of the people of Shanghai was that the freezing of foreign exchange had the possibility of expanding to the Far East at any time. The tense situation caused by the freezing of foreign exchange was also in danger of breaking out at any time. Therefore, the foreign exchange market at that time was unstable and full of dangers. The most prominent were four: (1) The return of escaping funds. Those with foreign exchange urgently needed to exchange it back for legal tender to prepare early. (2) Import settlement was sluggish. Importers feared the constraints of freezing. (3) Foreign merchants and banks sold off. Banks such as Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui had a large number of foreign exchange positions to sell off. According to market estimates, the total was about 10 million yuan to avoid the constraints of freezing. (4) Foreign banks restricted forward foreign exchange trading. British and American banks, fearing that a freezing order would be issued, would face commercial disputes with frozen countries due to the fulfillment of contracts, so they were willing to restrict forward transactions slightly. Therefore, judging from the actions of various parties at that time, the United States was still hesitating about freezing Chinese and Japanese funds. However, the people of Shanghai had already paid close attention and expected that it would be realized sooner or later.</p>
<h3>(3) Abnormal Phenomena After the Freezing</h3>
<p>The United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds. As expected by all parties, the U.S. President signed an executive order on the evening of July 15, effective from the 26th. The freezing measures were based on the amended Tianjin Country Freezing Funds Regulations of June 14 of this year, and detailed rules for implementing the freezing were issued in the form of general notes. The general notes issued by the United States for freezing Chinese and Japanese funds totaled 16, from No. 54 to No. 69. One was given to the Dutch Merchant Bank of China in Kobe, one was given to the Chinese government's agencies in the United States, two were given to Chinese and Japanese expatriates in the United States, two were given to American banks and Chinese and Japanese banks in the United States, four were given to Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai, and six were given to Hong Kong, Hawaii, and the Philippines. Regarding those abroad, let's not discuss them for the time being. The four notes given by the United States to Shanghai were Nos. 58, 59, 60, and 61. Note No. 58 stipulated that from June 14, 1941, people doing business in China could engage in normal import and export trade, but could not manage trade on behalf of people from blocked countries outside China and people living in the Northeast. The conditions for applying for foreign exchange must be legitimate import and export, and the value of the import and export must be equal to the amount of foreign exchange applied for, and must comply with the various terms and conditions stipulated in this note. Note No. 59 authorized 14 foreign banks in Shanghai to engage in foreign exchange business and to assist import and export trade between China (excluding the Northeast) and the United States, the American Republic, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch Indies. However, the aforementioned banks may not request the transfer or withdrawal of frozen U.S. dollar deposits. Before the banks issue letters of credit, accept or pay bills of exchange, or make other payments and transfers due to import and export trade, the import trade must meet the following conditions: (1) This trade must be legitimate import and export, and the value of the import and export must be equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange applied for. (2) This import and export must comply with the terms and conditions stipulated in this note. Note No. 60 specifically allowed the Chinese government and the Central Bank to accept requests from the people to transfer or transfer their frozen deposits or securities to domestic banks in the name of the government or the Central Bank. Note No. 61 allowed the Chinese Transportation Bank, the Chinese Farmers Bank, and the Third Bank to engage in foreign exchange trading, with the same provisions as Note No. 59.</p>
<p>The British freezing order for Chinese funds was formally announced by the British government on July 29. The freezing measures were to order British banks in China to freeze all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, etc., held in China or branches outside China. They would continue to provide assistance for import and export trade between China and the pound sterling group areas and authorized the Shanghai HSBC, McCallie, and Yuli banks to handle applications for the supply of pound sterling drafts.</p>
<p>The British and American freezing measures for Chinese funds have been roughly described above. The British freezing measures are very strict. However, since the British controlled the pound sterling exchange rate, the relationship between the pound sterling and the Shanghai foreign exchange market was not very large. Therefore, the impact of the British freezing on Shanghai was also very limited. What was the impact of the American freezing on Shanghai? This is what this article should examine. Before the U.S. freezing of funds was announced, the psychology of the people of Shanghai regarding the freezing was that U.S. dollar deposits could not be freely used, and the Shanghai free market would no longer exist. At that time, those who sold foreign exchange came one after another. The U.S. dollar fell to around $5.50 but still lacked buyers. After the U.S. freezing order arrived in Shanghai on July 26, the market was initially chaotic because the truth about the freezing was unclear. After American banks received General Notes No. 58 and No. 59 on the 29th, the freezing measures were not as strict as generally expected. The so-called freezing was just a kind of restriction. As a result, the foreign exchange market not only did not disappear because of this, but instead triggered a huge storm. The reasons were: (1) 14 foreign banks in Shanghai had notes to continue buying and selling foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market did not disappear, and the market was as prosperous as before. (2) Chinese and Japanese merchants could freely buy and sell foreign exchange without being frozen. The forward bills of exchange that had been sold before were now replenished in full. (3) Due to the restrictions of the notes, all foreign exchange positions of Chinese banks could not be freely sold on the market. (4) There were no detailed regulations on the application for foreign exchange, and foreign banks took advantage of their superior power to seek profits. On the one hand, they implemented squeeze measures, and on the other hand, they quoted prices at exorbitant prices, which caused the exchange rate to fall again and again. The U.S. dollar saw a low price of $4.50 again. Therefore, the result of this freezing of funds was that legal tender was under great pressure, foreign exchange business of Chinese merchants was suspended, and foreign banks had the opportunity to monopolize and obtained many unexpected gains. Although this kind of situation is an inevitable phenomenon in the transition period, we cannot but regret that the freezing is not thorough and has many loopholes.</p>
<h3>Recent Trends of the Exchange Equalization Fund A Tentative Survey of the Exchange Equalization Law Wang Liewang</h3>
<p>As a result of the Exchange Equalization Fund's meeting in Hong Kong, trial measures for September were announced on the 9th of this month. The measures are called trial measures and are preceded by the words "September," indicating that they are temporary in nature. If there are no major obstacles in the implementation, the trial period can be extended. Otherwise, the next month must be amended. This is also well known. In order to cope with the complicated situation and special environment of Shanghai, it is necessary to reserve flexibility in order to facilitate practice.</p>
<p>These trial measures are instructions to licensed banks for applying for foreign exchange. There are ten articles in total, with an attached list of permitted foreign exchange settlements, divided into two categories, A and B. Category A lists three essential goods in Shanghai: rice, petroleum products, and coal, with tobacco leaves included. According to the policy of state control over imports, tobacco leaves are one of the items prohibited from import as of July 1, 1928. The items listed in Category B are mostly among those prohibited from import. The percentage of foreign exchange settlement permitted for the Category A list is probably larger than that of Category B, as reported by banking sources. However, on the list, the status of tobacco leaves is only determined by rice, which seems inconsistent with the national import control policy, and most of the other listed imported goods violate the Ministry of Finance's ban on imports. The reason for this flexible measure is that most of the imported goods listed are raw materials for Shanghai industries, production tools, and consumer goods for foreigners. If foreign exchange is not settled for these commodities, Shanghai's industry and commerce will inevitably be severely affected, and there may be a panic. Therefore, in order to take into account the interests of foreign businessmen, and for the sake of employment of millions of employees and laborers in Shanghai, the adoption of this flexible measure is the same meaning as the previous establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund to maintain illegal foreign exchange trading in Shanghai.</p>
<p>These measures are generally based on the principle of quota allocation. Judging from this principle, there are four questions about quota supply: 1. How to determine the total amount of foreign exchange supplied each month? 2. How to determine the objects of foreign exchange supply? 3. How to determine the foreign exchange allocation for various imported goods on the list? 4. How to determine the foreign exchange allocation for merchants allowed to settle foreign exchange? The following is a separate description and discussion of these four questions:</p>
<p>(1) The Total Amount of Foreign Exchange Supplied Each Month</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>The total amount of the current Exchange Equalization Fund is 110 million US dollars (this number is the sum of 50 million supplied by American businessmen, 10 million pounds from the United Kingdom, equivalent to about 40 million US dollars, and 20</p>
<h3>European War Musings (7) - Soviet Russia's Vast Land and People</h3>
<p>Russians dislike routine and prefer opportunities for extraordinary and surprising displays. Soviet newspapers often proclaim exceptionally high productivity for individual workers, but according to the consistent opinion of foreign engineers and technicians, the average daily productivity per worker in the Soviet Union is still below the standards of Western countries. Some years ago, Soviet Russia paid close attention to planting gooseberries and other foreign berries in the Arctic regions, while seemingly neglecting the possibility of developing more extensive orchards in other suitable areas.</p>
<p>The appearance of Russian life has been greatly influenced by the revolution in many ways. Social classes have become more equal, the urban population has greatly increased, and many new factories, workers' residences, office buildings, and the Moscow subway, etc., all indicate modernization.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has a large-scale automobile manufacturing plant, modeled after the Ford factory, but its production capacity lags far behind. Because Soviet Russia has few and poor roads, the automobile industry is not very developed.</p>
<p>Soviet farmers account for two-thirds of the total population, and after the revolution, the psychology and life of the farmers have completely changed. The first achievement of the Communist Party after seizing power was to allow farmers to seize and divide all the landlords' property. Twelve years after the revolution, Soviet land was divided into small farms averaging nineteen to twenty acres, and the free buying and selling of land was prohibited long ago. The Soviet Union also actively carried out industrialization plans, attracting a large number of farmers into new industries, and the lives of workers have also undergone great changes.</p>
<p>Like farmers, there is a clear division among workers of different ages. Young workers are easily moved by Soviet slogans, while older workers pay more attention to practical life. The Soviet government's appeals have always focused on national defense, without mentioning the achievements of the revolution and collective farms. This may have a significant impact on the mood of the Soviet people!</p>
<p>In terms of the geography of western Soviet Russia, Leningrad has many shipyards that can build battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, and other ships. Soviet naval guns are also manufactured at the Putilov Steel Works there. Kronstadt is the only important naval port on the Baltic coast. Sevastopol is the main naval port on the Black Sea coast, and there are many shipyards nearby.</p>
<p>If the German army could occupy the above ports, its naval strength would be greatly enhanced. The Soviet Union originally had 1.4 million tons of merchant ships, and perhaps a part of it would inevitably be seized. The situation of the Axis powers on the high seas will also change at that time. Direct navigation between the threatened Baltic Sea and Black Sea will be possible, and they can free up considerable naval force to escort goods from the Black Sea to the coastal ports of Europe in the Mediterranean, to alleviate the European economic panic.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's inland canals are interconnected and extremely important for transportation. If a single one of the many river ships and steamships falls into the hands of the German army, they will definitely make good use of them.</p>
<p>From a purely economic point of view, Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Belarus are the most fertile regions. In the past, the Soviet Union exported grains, most of which came from Ukraine. The region is rich in sugar cane, wheat, and coal and iron. Almost all of the Soviet Union's only manganese mines are in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In recent years, although the Soviet authorities have established many factories in the Ural Mountains around Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk, and in Central Asia, most of the machine manufacturing plants and steel mills are still located in Ukraine, especially around Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and Dnipro.</p>
<p>Belarus is rich in livestock, grains, and sweet potatoes. The Caucasus not only produces coal and oil, but is also known for its copper, leather, and forests. These western regions of the Soviet Union also produce large quantities of livestock, many flax fields, and thousands of acres of vegetable fields. Germany, which lacks fat, must be drooling.</p>
<p>If the Caucasus falls, even if the Red Army carries out extensive destruction before retreating, it will not be able to stop the region from producing oil for more than a year. On the surface, it seems that if the German army can force the Red Army to retreat to the interior, it can seize a large amount of materials and equipment, at which time Germany's military needs will be able to obtain endless new resources, and new transportation routes can be opened up, breaking the British naval blockade.</p>
<p>But the problem is not that simple. During the last European War, the German army also controlled the entire area of Ukraine and almost Rostov, but it was of no avail. Russia has always had transportation difficulties, which even German organizational experts cannot solve. This situation is bound to reappear today. The Soviet people are rich in latent destructive power. But the fundamental difficulty does not lie here.</p>
<p>First, if Germany transports Soviet food and riches to Europe to prevent famine in Europe, then famine is likely to occur in any of the occupied areas of the Soviet Union, thereby causing resentment among the people of the occupied areas. For example, last April, the Soviet Union promised to transport 250,000 tons of grain to relieve Belgium, but only one-ninth was shipped out, and the food shortage in western Soviet Russia had already become acute. Moreover, Ukraine's harvest this year will inevitably be greatly affected by the war.</p>
<p>Most of the Soviet Union's agricultural production relies on tractors, and because of agricultural mechanization, gasoline has become a necessity for agricultural work. Last year, the Soviet Union produced a total of 52 million tons of oil, of which only 1 million tons were exported. The oil production in 1927 was less than last year, but 6 million tons were exported. This is more due to the sharp increase in agricultural use than to stockpiling oil for war. This year, if thousands of machinery stations cannot distribute gasoline on time, cultivation will inevitably be greatly affected, then Soviet Russia itself will inevitably suffer from famine, let alone relieve Europe.</p>
<p>The German authorities are well aware that the benefits of occupying western Soviet Russia can hardly be realized within this year, and obviously hope to consolidate their position as soon as possible to prepare for a long-term war.</p>

<h3>Transferring De-Sealed Funds to the Central Bank; Payment in Original Foreign Currency Permitted</h3>
<p>Limited to Purchasing and Transporting Non-Prohibited Items; Other Legitimate Uses Also Subject to Application</p>
<p>Shanghai Importers and Exporters Should Sincerely Cooperate with the Stabilization Board</p>
<p>After the Central Bank was ordered to handle the de-sealing of foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens, all foreign exchange drafts held by exporters of various industries and foreign exchange deposit certificates deposited by Chinese citizens in Chinese commercial banks operating foreign exchange may be applied to the Central Bank for de-sealing, or the Central Bank may purchase them at a price set by the Ministry (i.e., the exchange rate set by the Stabilization Fund), or transfer them to the bank to open new foreign currency accounts. If foreign exchange is needed for legitimate purposes, an application should be filed in advance, and the original currency may be withdrawn only after approval.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks' Deposit Disposal</p>
<p>Regarding foreign currency deposits deposited by Chinese citizens in foreign banks, they have also been frozen and cannot be freely withdrawn. However, Chinese citizens can also transfer the bank's deposit certificates to the Central Bank for de-sealing. Foreign friendly banks are allowed to pay in legal tender converted according to the market price. Private transfers or sales to importers are absolutely prohibited in order to prevent malpractices and comply with the freezing decree. As for the legal tender deposits of Chinese citizens in foreign banks, they can still be freely deposited or withdrawn and are not subject to any restrictions. The 14 friendly banks, including HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile Bank, that have obtained general notes from the United States have mostly implemented the above methods to prevent the outflow of foreign exchange deposits.</p>
<p>Payment in Original Currency Subject to Approval</p>
<p>The New Life News Agency reporter recently learned from the Central Bank that all foreign exchange funds of Chinese citizens that have been de-sealed and transferred to the bank may apply for payment in the original foreign currency in accordance with the following regulations: (1) The goods imported by depositors from foreign countries are not prohibited and are necessary for the country; (2) The necessary living expenses, tuition fees, and travel expenses for depositors or their family members residing in the country where the funds are frozen; (3) Other necessary and legitimate uses. All applicants for payment in the original foreign currency should state the reasons in detail and submit relevant documents to the Central Bank for forwarding to the Foreign Exchange Control Committee for approval. Payment is permitted only after approval.</p>
<p>Importers and Exporters Should Cooperate</p>
<p>Foreign economic expert Alles published an article in the Greater Shanghai Weekly yesterday, hoping that businessmen can sincerely cooperate with the Stabilization Board. It is said that the Stabilization Board manages the foreign exchange market by means of apportionment and purchasing export bills. Food rice imported by the Public Works Department can obtain 100% of the supply. On the other hand, the amount of foreign exchange obtained for many specially approved imported goods will be insufficient for the original needs in the future. There are also many goods that will not be obtained at all. Then the import quantity will be greatly reduced. However, the plan of the Stabilization Board has been decided and must be implemented. The Stabilization Board certainly cannot provide as much foreign exchange as Shanghai needs, fearing that it will repeat the mistakes of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund from 1939 to 1940. Shanghai businessmen have two opportunities to hope that the Stabilization Board will make greater contributions to Shanghai in the future. One is to cooperate sincerely with the Stabilization Board. Merchants who are fortunate enough to obtain foreign exchange should ensure that their foreign exchange does not flow out. At the same time, the imported goods supplied with foreign exchange by the Stabilization Board should not be sold directly or indirectly to others. Another opportunity is to make the foreign exchange earned from exports in the future more than the Stabilization Board expects. The Stabilization Board has no intention of hoarding foreign exchange at the expense of Shanghai. The more foreign exchange Shanghai sells to the Stabilization Board, the more foreign exchange the Board will allow Shanghai to have. If Shanghai's exports to democratic countries can maintain the level at the end of July this year, the amount of foreign exchange settlement for specially approved imported goods will inevitably increase greatly. Conversely, if Shanghai's exports are sluggish and produce less export foreign exchange, the amount of foreign exchange settlement will inevitably decrease. Shanghai businessmen must make the greatest efforts to realize these two opportunities. If so, they will surely be rewarded.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Police Arrest People on Hankou Road</h3>
<p>Three People Arrested at the Huibinlou Restaurant, Taken Back to Their Residence for Search and Taken to the Police Station</p>
<p>At about 6:30 pm yesterday, several Japanese people, accompanied by police officers from the Central Police Station, suddenly rushed to Room 7, Taipingfang, 341 Hankou Road, upstairs in the right wing room, in two cars and searched the room. They left after about two hours. It is said that Yan Junsu, a native of Dongting Mountain, Suzhou, 27 or 28 years old, was having dinner with two friends at the Huibinlou Restaurant on Simalu at about 6 pm yesterday, when several Japanese people, accompanied by Chinese and Western police officers, suddenly arrived and arrested all three of them. They were immediately taken to their residence at 7 Taipingfang for search. After the reporter went to investigate, he saw that the clothes boxes, etc. in the room were in a mess. According to his roommates, Yan was gentle and weak, like a scholar. This sudden arrest is really puzzling.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Willkie, Passes Through Shanghai on His Way Home</h3>
<p>US Ambassador to Moscow, Willkie, recently returned home on business. He has departed from Moscow and is traveling by train through Siberia to China. Willkie has arrived in Shanghai and is waiting for a ship to return to Washington via San Francisco. Willkie's trip is secret, and few outsiders know about it. The President Harrison left Shanghai yesterday afternoon and has left Shanghai on board.</p>
<h3>Advisory Committee's Allocation of Members to be Established Next Week</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department has decided to levy a special property tax on business premises from January 1 next year. However, before the opening of the levy, in accordance with the resolution of the special meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17 this year, the opinions of the Advisory Committee must be sought. However, how this organization will be formed is directly related to administration. How many people will there be, how will the candidates be selected, and the Public Works Department and the consuls of the countries concerned are negotiating. According to the Dazhong News Agency reporter, the principle has been decided on the allocation of members, with 3 each for Britain, the United States, and Japan, 4 for the Chinese side, and 1 each for Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, for a total of 16 people. It is not yet known what method will be used to produce representatives, but it is expected that it will be established within the next week.</p>
