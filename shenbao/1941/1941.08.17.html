<p>莫斯科召集三國代表開會、共商分配戰具事宜之建議、甚表贊同、渠已準備採取一切必要步驟、俾此會議可　早舉行云、</p>
<p>路透社十六日莫斯科電　今日蘇聯各報、均以顯著地位登載對於羅斯福·邱吉爾兩氏有歷史性的會見之評論、謂為具有最高之政治重大意義、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日華盛頓電　國卿務赫爾昨稱、渠希望世界各文明國家、包括蘇聯在內、能奉行羅斯福·邱吉爾聯合宣言、以摧毀納粹之暴力統治、而重建世界新秩序、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日倫敦電　此間權威界昨日於評論日本或將阻止民治國內由海參崴以給接濟蘇聯事稱、「英國將盡力實現援蘇之政策」、惟關於日本一旦企圖封鎖海參崴、則英國將出以若何行動一事、則未有所言、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日紐約電　史格列普斯霍華德係報國際編輯辛姆斯昨報、和平八原則宣言所產生之「英美同盟」、可望將戰事及早推進至最高峯、渠言、「如柏林與東京對羅斯福總統於必要時不惜一戰、以終止彼等統治世界之意圖表示懷疑、則殊愚妄之至、</p>
<h3>兩國漐驚人行動　美認係指遠東局勢　又傳英軍將在北歐登陸</h3>
<p>路透社十六日倫敦電　路透社國會記者稱、英美兩巨頭致斯達林電發表後、海上數日會議所討論之許多事項、乃有一部份之披露、三五日內所議定之八項原則、非即為羅斯福·邱吉爾會議之全部結果、今八項原則發出後、不出三十六小時、即有此重要電文之公布、此後當局尚有其他披露、以補充此八項原則者自在意中、綜之無論希特勒主義在世界任何地方抬頭、恊約國將以全力撲滅之、此乃英·美當軸之唯一旨趣、原電中所稱戰爭刻在多處陣綫進行、將來或在新陣綫再有戰事一語、已　示此種行動矣、</p>
<p>路透社十六日紐約電　昨晚各報載一消息、據稱、美總統羅斯福·英首相邱吉爾、擬向蘇聯斯達林建議、在莫斯科召開一種會議、出席者為斯達林與其軍事領袖及美·英高級人員、紐約郵報大書特書曰、擬在蘇京舉行三强會議、紐約世界　間報預料、美·英在海上會議後、將有驚人之行動、</p>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電　此間各觀察家皆認為、羅斯福邱吉爾致斯達林函電中、為包含實踐最後消滅納粹虐政之第一具體行動、此項電文明白表示、以重要戰具援助蘇聯之緊要、而「另外戰場」一語、此間人士皆認為、係直接指遠東局勢、若干方面以為、此項函電係警吿日本以兩氏業經同意於一種行動、各觀察家又信、此項函電可反映英、美之信任蘇聯困德之能力、</p>
<p>國際社十六日電　羅斯福·邱吉爾會晤後、英攻歐助蘇之說漸熾、各界均信、英首相將有較宣言更進一步之行動、倫敦新聞記者報預測、攻歐英軍將在「茂曼斯克」或「亞昌吉爾」登陸、據稱、此時進攻挪威·荷蘭·建立對德第二陣綫、良機不可失去、每日郵報稱、羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相、現正在「美海岸附近某處」、由英·美海空聯合保護、關於會議之進行、蘇聯常獲報吿、</p>

<h3>美生產力量　迅速增加　日南進將從緩</h3>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電　此間對於羅斯福總統早日發表爐邊談話之可能性、仍紛加揣測、就一般而言、美國之工業及戰爭努力、刻正迅速增加、至最大之力量、現時援英之程度、或超過此間或英國民衆所想像、此項援助更將自動逐步增加其數量、然若希冀英·美聯合宣言之結果、美國不待德·日續有舉動、即將有更進一步之行動、則殊屬錯誤矣、</p>
<p>路透社十六日重慶電　此間消息靈通人士預料、在最近之將來、太平洋及歐洲方面、均有重大國際發展、華方觀察家仍信、日本雖侈談南進程式、但目前將從綏進行、以免與英·美發生大戰、而同時則似集中努力於北面、以便進攻蘇聯之遠東陸軍、在另一方面、日本為保護其後方起見、必須在北攻之前、鞏固其在南海之地位、此即日本佔領越南南部之所由來也、此項觀察家並非謂日本並無南進野心、但認為此舉之時機尚未成熟、似將於英·美有事於他處之時、再行騷動、俾日本得不冒與英·美作戰之危險而向南進取、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英美會談與遠東</h3>
<p>在羅邱會談表面化之後，舉世雖明知雙方所發表的聯合宣言僅是一種“官樣文章”，卻依然甚加重視者，正因為觀於宣言內容，充分證明英美兩國已決定“共同合作，以遏止侵略，戰勝強權，俾為全世界愛好自由各國，樹立永久的正義的和平”。聯合宣言所列舉的八項要旨，其精義不外乎此，乍看似乎僅為一種空論，其實卻表明英美已有不惜任何代價，協同粉碎侵略勢力的“最後決心和具體方策”；這不是說過去英美沒有決心或缺少方策，不過，經過此次兩國巨頭的當面折衝，敢斷言凡是以前缺少聯貫性的，今後定必獲有適當的調整，凡以前僅僅限於局部的，今後定必擴充為一種首尾相應的全面計劃，凡以前還停留在審議研討中者，今後更必隨時即可付諸事實。何況觀於兩國軍事大員均於百忙之中，親往參預談話，更足證明雙方所討論以及所決定的，決不致限於聯合宣言中所見的八項原則。</p>
<p>關於此度會談的具體決定，截至目下為止，官方既守口如瓶，外間也絕少綫索，據合眾社訊，或謂在羅邱協定之下，今後美國將側重其注意力於太平洋局勢，俾英蘇得以勝出較大力量，對付德國，又據路透社推測，此次會談定會涉及（一）大西洋戰爭、（二）對蘇援助，（三）遠東局勢三大問題；這兩種報道。前者係指分工合作的界限而言，後者則泛指討論對象而言，當然都有其可能。吾人認為僅就此次會談的關防嚴密以及參加人員的地位重要兩點看來，即可斷言其所討論的範圍既甚廣大，其所決定的措置，更非尋常可比。大抵羅邱二氏曾就今後世界各地所可發生的一切事變，通盤加以估量，然則再根據各專家尤其是軍事當局的條陳，決定一個分別應付的全面計劃；但是，由於美國是一個民治國家，又量　個素來揭橥門羅主義的中立國家，凡總統在未經國會許可前所決定的任何辦法，無論如何，終不免帶一些消極性質，換句話說，無論羅斯福總統的意志如何堅決，但在憲法限制之下，茍非對方先事挑釁，事實上他不能貿然對外宣戰，或從事可被反對派指為參戰的行動，因此單就遠東而言，吾人不難想像此次羅邱會談所決定的一切步驟。凡屬於經濟性質的制裁手段以及依據租借法而然的一切援助辦法，今後當然不妨以主動的姿態，次第付諸實施，（英車的宣佈禁止對日輸出和美國油船的開赴海參崴，即其明證），但在軍事方面，則英美兩國——尤其是美國，在日本未敢有何新發動之前，事實上衹有暫時限於危險地帶充實本身作戰力量。並積極援助早已或可能駢肩作戰的其他各國；具體言之，非俟日本終於侵略泰國或實行北進，甚或企圖切斷美國援蘇路綫，英美巨頭日前所商定的對日軍事性行動，纔能付諸實施，否則，衹有一方加緊戒備，以堵塞一切可供日本逞凶的漏洞，一方則在經濟及其他方面，繼續削弱日本的殘餘膨脹力；譬如一局撲克，現在雖已到了“看牌”的時候，但問題是中英美蘇荷等　著要看日本的最後一張紙牌，而絕不是民治陣綫已處於不得不先攤牌的境地。</p>
<p>平沼的被刺，預示日本國內的極度不安，勢將迫使近衛內閣鋌而走險，假使近衛依然“舉棋不定”，以致引起若干軍人的極度“不滿”，則說不定日本又要釀成新的閣潮，反之，日本若果不顧一切，決定冒險蠢動，則在這英美當局業已擬定整個應付方案，以及遠東各民治國均已嚴陣以待的今日，使人感覺日本他在日所當遭遇的泥淖，將不止中國一處；這幾天的東京當局既處於這種兩難的局面之下，所謂徬徨苦悶，所謂憂疑震盪，恐怕都還不足以形容其心境於萬一。</p>

<p>合衆社十六日倫敦電羅斯福、邱吉爾會議之最顯著特色、固爲揚示兩大民治國和平目的之八點程序、但衆信其他重要問題、必亦有透澈之討論、其所成立之決定、日內當可披露、據衆推測、下述三大問題、定亦討論及之、（一）大西洋戰爭、（二）對蘇援助、（三）遠東局勢、就第一點而言、現有防衛計劃之整個制度將予修改、至於如何修改、則當然爲機密事件、他日德國將以重大代價而知英、美布置之更大效率、以言對蘇援助、似與蘇聯當局進行之商討行將舉行、大的英。美重要代表將與蘇政府開會討論、以獲共同資源之迅速決定與適當支配、聞霍浦金已深悉蘇聯最所需要者爲何物、故英·美沿此方針向蘇建議固意中事也、至於遠東則生力軍之繼續開抵遠東、已可知其戒備惟若日政府稍知顧慮、則英國方面未有採行可爲日本視爲挑釁的任何步驟之趨勢、同時、英·美皆竭力加速進行軍火出產之程序、</p>
<p>路透社十六日重慶電　此間各方面皆熱烈歡迎羅斯福。邱吉爾官言、半官方面稱、此宣言表示廣大政治手腕、可促進反抗侵略的各國間更密切之合作、中國政界因英·美以戰後解除軸心國武裝爲其主要戰爭目的之一、尤感滿意、</p>
<p>路透社十六日墨爾缽電　澳洲工黨領袖柯丁批評羅斯福·邱吉爾官言稱、此種明白概述目的之宣言、與澳洲工黨之精神與決心完全符合、余不能想像任何國家連德國及淪陷各國在內、其工會有不受此歷史性的宜言之感動者、凡疑惑英·美工人在此决奮鬥中除抵抗侵略之正直目的外、抱有其他目的者、觀此宣言、可永遠氷釋其疑矣、</p>
<p>德方譏評　英美宣言</p>
<p>際社十六日柏林電　自英美八點聯合宣言發表後、昨日德方朝野即怒斥各民治國、而稱該項宣言所表顯者、即軸心國正謀予以毀滅之黑暗世界秩序、德外部發言人受意向羅斯福總統及邱吉爾首相大呼曰、「爾等若欲解除吾人之武裝、請即取去吾人之槍砲、敢乎、」納粹報界猛烈抨擊羅邱二氏之會議及英美聯合宣言、詆之爲「虛聲恫嚇」、德外部發言人叉謂、「今全歐已能察見、若民治國在世界上有其前途、則歐洲將有何遭遇、今日之英美八點宣言、乃故美總統威爾遜十四點程序之縮本耳、自一九一九年以來、該項程序常使歐州空氣汚濁不淸、今羅邱宣言舊事重提、適可表示軸心國應獲勝利之理由、民治國現已揭其矯飾之幕、露其眞正目的、較諸在凡爾賽所擬定者更爲自私也」、</p>
<p>海通社十六日柏林電　論及德國外交部發言人昨日羅邱宣言八點稱、該項共同宜言實爲一種今已不復存在之事件、關於英美擬發動和平攻勢、該發言人稱、吾人僅有一種攻勢，即軍事攻勢、僅有一個目的、即殲滅敵人、僅有一件使命、即獲得勝利是、必須於勝利後始能談及和平、大西洋會議之收穫、則適與人人所期待者相反、蓋世界人士聆聽彼方之宣傳後、固均注意於此次「重要事件」之發展也、柏林政界人士對於兩大民主國家之代表已使德國處於被宣傳之地位、頗爲滿意、該兩大政治家目標之逈異、實頗堪使人注意、威爾斯旣曾談及戰後之國際聯盟、艾登亦會提議一具有相當權力之國際警察組織、而在宣霄中對於此所謂國際聯盟或其類似組織者、竟隻字不提、不知此係由於羅斯福之意見、抑由於邱吉爾之意見所致、所謂點」者仍存留於宜言中、威爾遜爲此點」之發明者、不過當時其數目較此番略多、而面目亦略異、歐洲人士對於此著名之「點」、至今猶留有深刻之印像、決不願再嚐試此「點」之經騐矣外交部更認爲前所提及英國某通訊社記者所稱會議係由羅斯福發起一點、極堪注意、此使人記起一成語、即勝利係由人人獲得、而失敗則非由人人所致、柏林人士稱、德國及歐洲之人民頗可向羅邱二氏反詰、究竟在該兩氏之新秩序內、不論大小强弱各民族均能實際獲得海上自由吾、英美願放棄其海軍根據地及海上霸權吾、美國願放棄其兩洋海軍計劃而不威脅日本吾、彼等願開放其物產豐富而人口稀少之地帶以讓他人揷足吾、羅斯福將希望恢復其門羅主義否、對於撲滅歐洲布爾雪維克之工作羅氏有何感想、羅邱二擬放棄其封鎖政策而使婦孺不致餓斃吾、如忠實回答此等等問題後、則此次共同宜言立將被證明係一種幻想、歐洲人民早已受過該種幻想之經騐、而不願再度嚐到其苦味矣、</p>
<p>路透社十六日東京電　英美關於世界政策之聯合宜言、使日人深爲忿恨、又日外務省喉舌日本時報星期六晨刋社論謂、英、美聯合宜言中之八點、對於日本政策未有新穎之處云、該報言及宜言中第二點、謂日本未有土地等野心、此乃日本對中滿公的所可爲證者、至於第四項、則日本始終依平等基礎開放覓取天然資源之途徑云、該報叉謂、裁軍理想爲舉世所歡迎、惟國際會議所發現之任何方法、皆未能使之實施、此項宣言可視爲有歷史上重要性、因其適合軸心國所已宣布之願望、不過方法不同耳、</p>

<p>合衆社十六日新加坡電　此間觀察家相信、羅斯福·邱吉爾聯合宣言、將增强泰國對日本壓力之反抗、因該宣言允許英·美合作、在全世界遏止侵略也、此間高級當局稱、此項宣言、一般人「原預料將係針對日本而發、」值得重視者、在過去五日中、新加坡之緊張情形、已見稍减、」報紙對宣言之反響不一、「海峽時報」稱之爲衆人皆料將有爆炸時之「潮濕爆竹之爆炸」、該報對宣言未能顯示英·美合作之程度表示失望、該報云、「吾人固希望該宣言能對日本出以堅決之道及或竟加以嚴厲之警告、告以必須停止侵略、否則將與吾人全體爲敵、俾能使遠東局勢澄清者也」、该报以爲、此英宣言已解除日本目前对英·美在遠東有所行動之恐怖、日商「先驅報」解釋第四條宣言、認爲係向日本建議「改變現時前進之途徑」、以換取貿易機會之均等、該報又言、此項建議、殊值得日本政府之審慎考慮云</p>

<h3>烏克蘭區鐵砂中心　德方宣稱已被個佔領</h3>
<p>路透社十六日倫敦電　「史紀報」軍事評論員稱、德軍在烏克蘭南部之進犯、究係佯犯、抑係傾全力之攻勢、僅希特勒與德軍司令部知之、據現狀觀之、戰爭規模當然頗大、以哩數計、德軍右翼已大獲進展、蘇方承認已從普伏摩斯克與基洛夫格拉特（尼柯萊夫北一百廿哩）後退、似正退至尼伯柯灣後、該河頗有天塹不能飛渡之概、蘇軍之撒退顯屬井然不亂、而德軍亦未有進迫尼伯河之象、德方揚言已佔基洛夫格　特東南鐵砂中心地克列伏洛格、此說如果屬實、則該地於德方亦無所用、蓋德方所需者非鐵砂、但係油類、德軍縱續有進展、亦必發現油類已被蘇軍搬運一空矣、今尙過早、不能謂蘇軍之聯絡已被截斷、蘇方至今仍能從海道運兵增援、並威脅德軍交通之側面、前綫其他各部未有顯著變動、亦無大舉展開新攻勢之象、斯摩倫斯克與基輔兩區蘇德軍隊必皆待機而動、芬軍顯有若干活動、但未有重大發展、</p>

<h3>德軍侵蘇變更戰略　企圖截斷通海出路</h3>

<h3>印度詩聖　泰戈爾訪問的回憶（三）  徐寶謙</h3>
<p>「在樹林的遠影中，紅日向薩拉瓦底河畔西沈了。隱者的孩子們，從田野回到靜寂的林園，他們牽着疲乏的耕牛，到林間安息。草屋的院落中，燃燒着拜神的火光。孩子們沐浴完了，聚集在院內，靜聆大師喬達摩的訓誨。在天空中，在無限的空間裏，平安之神閒坐着，似乎是在默想。衆星環繞着和平之神，似乎要靜聽神的敎訓。忽然間安靜的樹林震動了，大師喬達摩發言道：孩子門德阿，我要吿訴你門Brahma.Vidya　在Tapovana的樹巔上，旦來臨了。隱士的孩子們，晨起沐浴，黃金般的頭髮，在晨曦中，反映如露珠。他們在　Bata　樹下，圍繞着大師喬達摩。在烏鳴，蜂吟，和水流聲中，他們異口同聲地唱着Sama歌。」</p>
<p>我們從此，不但可以看出泰氏的敎育理想，並且可以看出泰氏敎育事業的哲學基礎。</p>
<p>政治思想　泰氏的林間學校，創立於一九〇一年。過了不久，國尺自主運動應運而起了。泰氏對於國家主義，雖表同情，但對於它的流弊，早已淸楚看出。如一九〇一年，泰氏已經淸楚地說過：「國家主義以各民族盲目地追求自己的私利爲基礎。所謂愛國主義，無非是各民族妄自尊大，藐視其他民族的代名詞。它同武力與非眞理，有着密切的連緊。</p>
<p>一九一六年，泰氏遊歷日本及美國。他眼見兩國國內國家主義的高潮，他就苦口婆心地對兩國民族提出警吿。</p>
<p>一九二叫年，泰氏來中國，上海日僑恊會曾開會歡迎。泰氏演詞中有云：「當我遊歷貴國時，曾經見着一些西洋化的政客。他們的目的，無非是要擴充本國的勢力，排斥別國。這種狹窄的國家思想，是理想主義的仇敵，是人生機械化的自然結局。」同年，泰氏在北京英美協會演講，也說：「當我路過日本時，我看見所謂從中國得來的「戰利品公開地陳列着。我眞不了解，這種誇耀，到底有甚麼竟義。我也曾經質問過幾個日本朋友，他們說，這種敎育爲　國民準備着對外作戰，是必要的。他們父說，爲使國民愛國起見，必須引起民衆仇視外國的心理。不過，據我看，這小過是野蠻主義的復活罷了，它的結果，是非常可怕的。所幸的，日本另有牠可愛的方面。日本普通民衆，對人極有禮貌，他們崇尙古風，酷愛恬靜生活，而且，他們的生活，處處表現藝術化的精神。凡此種種，都是同好戰鬥的國家主義相反的」</p>
<p>泰氏父說：「我在美國，也看見同樣的情形，排斥異族的精神，到處可以看見。我覺得這決不是一個基督敎的國家所應有的現象。而且，這種精神，可以領人類到毀滅的路上。即現代的印度，也有同樣的趨勢。當我向印度的國家主義者，指出此種傾向的危險時，他們責備我，把印度人　成軟弱了。因爲，他們所崇拜的，是優勝劣敗，弱肉强食的公理</p>
<p>國際使命　因爲國家主義的流行，泰氏從日美回國後，深兌印度古代的文化，有提倡的必要。所以，他於一九一八年年底，在和平鄉召集了他舊時的學生，及朋友在會中，泰氏發表他的主張，改組原來的學校，使成爲提倡東方古代文明的中心，並將校名改爲Visra-Bharati，取集世界學術於一堂的意義，（即國際大學之義）。次世界大戰停止後，泰氏復於一九〇年遊歷歐洲，（按泰氏會於一九三年遊歷英國及歐洲，即泰氏因寫Gitanjali，得諾貝爾文學獎金之旅行），受各國社會人士的　大歡迎。此行結果，益加堅定了他素有的信仰，就是，東方文明能對全世界人類作重要的供獻。</p>
<p>當泰氏遊歷史州的時候（一九一六年），曾過見英國靑年Ｌ．K．Elmhist氏，自吿奮勇，幫同泰氏辦理農邨工作。到了此時，E氏實踐諾言，來泰氏處供職。所以，當一九二一年月，泰氏從央回國時，他規定了三種偉大計畫：（一）在國際大學提倡東方文明，（二）在國際大學附近，實騐農村改進L作，（三）藉國際大學提倡人類大同，調和東西文化。</p>
<p>晚年榮譽　泰氏曾於一九二四年來華游歷，目曾於一九三〇年游歷蘇俄（詳悄均見本文附錄）。</p>
<p>一九三六年五月，滴値泰氏七十五歲大壽，世界各地，賀電紛至，尊泰氏爲大詩人，大寫劇家，大小說家，社會改革家及宗敎大師。一九三七年夏，泰氏大病初愈。適値日本侵華，泰氏草文痛斥其殘暴。一九三八年冬，泰氏繪褂作品，在倫敦舉行展覽會。今年五月，英國牛津大學，打破先例，在泰氏所住的和平鄕舉行授榮典禮，贈氏以文學博十榮　學位。八月七日，氏壽終於加爾各答，各國人士聞之，莫不同聲哀悼。</p>
<p>氏出身望族，其族產宗敎家，哲學家，藝術家，文學家茶多。泰氏固爲族中翹楚，其兄　Dwinidranath爲哲學家，族人Sogonendranath　和　Abanmdranath等，皆爲藝術家，至於泰氏日常生活習慣：食物以牛乳，糖菜，蔬菜爲主，但不　肉食。四時早起，起後必　禱吿，爲世界祈求和平。日出即作戶外散步，寒暑無問。日中工作，非看書作詩，即作文作畫。晚問則召集男女學生，歌唱其所作詩曲，聲音溢於四外。新理成篇，輒作講演，聲調瞭亮，如黃鐘大呂。</p>

<h3>紗花　原棉和力太強　變馬塲外做過一千七百元</h3>
<p>紗　市始平繼昂、但漲風允熾、此因三二支單紗價昂、同時原棉漲力允强、於是投機商集中購進、一時籌碼不敷分配、至於空頭方面、大都由空翻多、如斯一來、市盤乃逐步上升、不過二十支紗實際銷路依然寥寥無幾、但邇來上漲之程度、爲量殊鉅、一旦獲利者出籠、反動深恐劇烈、猶不可不防也、不道目前人心熱烈、大衆目光、向紗花方面推進、二十支雙馬高價爲一千六百八十四元、低價爲一千六百四十三元、午後因週末向例無市、但暗盤成交幾十包、已做到一千七百元外、旋後一千六百九十五元賣不出、穿過上月二十八號之高價、爲一千六百八十五元、下週一交換所正式開慕營業矣、投機的人們、越漲越買、一跌則大實特賣也、査棉紗今有六百七十包、運往香港、</p>
<p>雙　馬晨開、因謠言甸緬路不及裝運棉紗、有一部份人心不振、首盤僅做一千六百四十三元、但塲中賣者不旺、市情反俏、逐步上升、旋聞取引所大衆買進、市况更昂、買氣更盛、步步上升至一千六百八十四兀、中途因盈利人吐出、回至一千六百七十六元、收盤價爲一千六百八十二元、査半日間成交統計七千六百八十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港　一八五　同行　七、我〇統計　七、六五</p>

<p>棉價拉抬愈猛　超過海外訂購行情</p>
<p>現棉情况、基礎固昂、但投機商抬力頗足、所以漲氣濃厚、然已抬至向海外購訂價之上、且目下來源依然暢通、未免越出軌道之外、不過投機人的作風、往往如斯、要拉拉得足、一放即瀉千里、故昨日成交較前略遜、而持貨者居此高峯、猶多扳不脫售、間有做開、又屬新峯、茲錄行情如左、</p>

<h3>英美宣言意義重大　滬人獲深切認識　對遠東政策將更趙堅決　日報亦認事態極端嚴重</h3>
<p>美國羅斯福總統與英首相邱吉爾談話終了後、於十四日午後發表共同宣言、列舉八八原則、聲明兩國無侵略野心、反對變更現狀、願被侵略國恢復主權與政府、以平等繁榮爲原則、自由貿易、俟消滅納粹暴政後，決縮减軍備、建立永久和平、第八項並表示、兩國必使侵略國解除武裝而後已、此項消息傳播全世界後、凡正義人士、咸表振奮、允爲中國所歡迎、認英美離以武力制裁日本之時期已不遠、中國勝利基礎、業已奠定也、昨日本埠各西報、對共同宣言、均著文評論、亦同此見解、一致認美國殆已對動心國宣戰、今後兩國對日政策、必更堅決、並將使日本無法與納粹呼應而繼續進行其冒險行動、即本埠二日文報所著社論、亦公然承認、茲將各報評論、摘譯大意於後、</p>
<p>美國經舉無異宣戰　大陸報社評論略云、英美兩巨頭之曾晤、顯巳昭示世界、侵略者與被侵略者之間、根本無妥協可言、此八大原則、即爲英美共同目標、欲達到此目標、必須爲自由而戰者、克服一切困難、毀滅侵略者意圖統制全世界之陰謀舉行動，美國此舉，無異已對侵略者宣戰，僅須待時行動而已、軸心政權雖認聯合宣言爲一種「恫嚇宣傳」惟此一要會晤、豈虛擇耶、威爾遜宣言十四點各方爭議雖認旣未保證公正之和平、亦未遏制另一戰爭之爆發、然現時之八項原則、簡短精華、自可避免再有爭議矣、此决會晤、對遠東影響、已備受華盛頓與倫教方面之關注、此後兩國對日政策、將更堅決、此項會晤決定之大策略、必將使日木對納粹德國之援助價値、趨於消滅、</p>
<p>未來舉措　待諸事實　英文大美晚國論略云、德國人民與政府現皆認休戰已屬不可能、蓋軸心國人民思想、向由政府操縱、今控制政府之人物、早已決定繼續作戰、故羅斯福與邱吉爾之聯合宣言、本意當不在離間軸心國人民與政府、故宣言必有其他理由、與切實計劃、並如美國如何輸送物資至英、對達加（Dakar）阿茶斯（Azovs）等地又作如何處置、對英美在遠東之未來舉措、對日木再進一步侵略、又應採何種步驟與徵處、均常以事實答覆、世界人士、或將接受迅捷而滿　之答覆、果如此則大西洋英美兩巨頭之會唔、當較德意兩巨頭在白萊納山隘之會晤、結果爲　滿也，</p>
<p>奠定永久和平基礎</p>
<p>字林西報社　略云、羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相之會唔、無疑將成大戰歷史上最重大事件、所宣布之八原則、其一爲戰爭目的、即在燬滅納粹暴政、其他七點和平目的、即在昌明民主國對侵略作戰之原則、此八大原則雖與威爾遜所列之十四點略同、惟有其更重要性、即在此决戰爭如能按照民主國所能接受之條件結束後、世界各弱小民族、將重獲自由、故按照維斯福與邱吉關所擬定之和平方式、當不再踏凡爾賽和約覆轍、故對政治尙未成熟之德國民族、决定全部解除武裝、殆後始足减經愛好和平民族之軍備負擔、今英美之有此的定、始將奉默全世界各種民族、以自由·安定·改進·使和平永遠奠定基礎、此目的之獲得、雖頗艱難、然必須達到而後已、</p>
<p>今後對日具有決心　日文上海每日新聞評論英云、美略聯合宣言、抽象視之、雖似溫和、目的則在企圖拉攏各國、列入自已陣營、以包圍德國、足見英美對此次大戰、已採取積極的態度、對日本雖有貿易或經濟上之機會均等說、但此言僅可作對中國被佔領區表示不平之解、此外則並未言及其他、足見此爲英美明白表示、企圖對軸心國採各個擊破政策、自歐戰發生後、彼等目的在打倒德國、故對日本似尙抱有綏和政策、但在另一方面觀察、彼等宣傳ＡＢＣＤ陣綫、美海軍當局宣稱、不辭兩洋作戰、英國並派遺軍艦至太平洋、對日備戰等、表面上雖仍對日本採取綏和政策、但雙方軍事首腦部旣均列席此項會議、難保不對日本有相當密謀、故此次宣言、雖可謂爲西半球之門羅主義、但萬一時期、難保或不分東西洋而有採取武力之決心、故英美今後之出處如何、實亦我人應深切關懷者也、</p>
<p>丙洋作戰殆無疑義</p>
<p>日文大陸新　評價各略云、關於此戰爭目的英美聯合宣言、其內容完全限於威爾遜之舊體制、今再予確認、對於重建世界、並無何等新的理想及意圖、僅欲維持現狀至牢固不破耳、羅斯福總統目的爲防止英德單獨搆和、邱吉爾則深恐德集中兵力攻英、故欲以此的束美國、俾能助英作戰、聯合宣言發表後、雙方之意圖、可謂均已滿足、旣共同一致、則美國終將參戰、僅時間問題耳、自英蘇締結軍事協定、的定雙方決不單獨對德搆和、今决英美又發表聯合宣言、可斷言英國決不致對德搆和、必將與蘇聯合力對付德國、故美國爲欲達到支配世界之慾望、而驅使英蘇爲共前哨、將積極援助英國、同時以軍火援助蘇聯，必要時或將使用蘇英在遠東軍事根據地、至於此項宣言、對遠東情勢、當然爲對日本之無言包圍、因美國旣已決意參戰、對大西太平兩洋態度、當無軒輊、將來在戰略上或將向大西洋採陽性的攻勢、而對太平洋則採陰性的攻勢、</p>
<h3>公共租界營業稅　傅公兩級徵收　原案係稅湖委員會擬定　明日財政會議將提討論</h3>
<p>日文大陸新報記載云、工部局財政委員會、已定十八日下午四時半、在工部局會議廳召集會議、討論公共租界有史以來之第一次徵收營業稅問題、依照公共租界憲法、即洋涇浜地皮草章程、對於工部局徵收範圍、曾有嚴格執照許可證費油、並對徵收稅額、亦有規定、最近租界行政機關擴大、各項支出增加、因此工部局每年均感收支不敷、此項</p>
<p>營業稅案　係由新稅源委員會擬定、法租界當局、前爲彌補財政虧空、本年初亦徵收營業稅、其種類分Ａ級及Ｂ級、屬於Ａ級者爲戲院·電影影院·商店·倉庫·工塲等、以房屋評價額二千四百元爲標準、徵收營業稅百分之八、超過二千四百元時、其超過額按百分之六徵收、屬於Ｂ級者、爲各銀行公司之事務所、各交易所事務所、法律事務所、保險業者、醫院、及其他一般自由職業者、亦以</p>
<p>房屋評價　一千四百元爲標準、徵收營業稅一成二分（即百分之十二）、超過此額者、其超過額按一成（即百分之十）徵收、故將來公共租界營業稅、大致按法租界同樣分類爲ＡＢ兩級、惟將依房屋評價額三千元爲標準、稅率將爲Ａ級徵收一成、超過額則徵收八分、Ｂ級徵收一成五分、超過額則微收一成二分、故此項營業稅實施後、工部局每年可增加稅收七百萬元、惟對於小資本者將依何項標準微收等種種問題、各方意見不一、故預料徵收稅率體制之全面的改革、尙有幾許困難、各方對此事、亦極爲關心、</p>

<h3>失學者的供狀　又是一個「無義之父」</h3>
<p>爲了對於申請助學金的手續，力求鄭重，同人曾沭着汗而興奮地從事各學生家庭狀况的調查，同人所戰戰兢兢的，是不願使待援迫切的學子，有一個人失望，同時亦不願使熱忱助學慷慨輸財的木報讀者，有一文錢虛耗。</p>
<p>十一日本報面談紀載中提到的「不情之兄」與無義之父」，都接到了讀者來信，對於「不情之兄」同情的信，不欲重佔篇幅，另外一位讀奢木君來信，他主張對於這位弟弟應走向生產之途上去，或者半工半讀，木君的意見，我們很感動很欽佩的。我們以爲以一位兄長有月薪數百元的收人。如果他是對於弟弟誠摯友愛的話，似乎總不致羅掘俱窮而不能爲弟弟籌每學期六七十元的學費。我們體會讀者捐金助學的厚意，對於道位成績品行都好的弟弟，絕不願使他的求學，有中途停輟之虞，所以我們必須設法幫助的。同時也希望社會上一般的負責敎育子弟的父兄，能够儘可能的負責，因爲孤苦無吿待助孔殷的學子，正多着呢！先其所急，後其所緩，我們覺得是應該這樣做，應該對於社會上並非絕對無力繳學費的父兄，致誠摯的希望，作率直的請求的．　「無義之父」這一段紀述，也接到幾件讀者謬加贊許的來信，其中以署名失學者的女士來信，最爲同情而誠摯，她們姊妹倆是正在社會奮鬥，以所人贍養她們的慈母，她們的父親，也是爲了別有所戀，而棄其糟糠之妻，而使兩個弱女失學的。這件事實，我們讀了女士來信，是萬分同情的；但是徒然責備她們的父親，也不會於事件本身有何益處。像這種情形，是道德問題，是愛情問題，是社會問題，要减少這類不幸事件，男女問鄭重結台是必要的，結合以後變方本着互愛互助互諒，才能成完滿的家庭。我們感覺的現實的事實，證明這種中途移愛，拋女棄妻，除了法律上不容許外，是不人道的，是破壞家庭的，是妨害善良風俗的，是削弱社會健全的，是要受個人良心譴賣的，是要受道德嚴厲裁判的。愛因斯坦在自述中曾說，人們接受社會中固有的德性，如同接受空氣一樣的自然；我們發表這位女士的來信，是期望社會上正在走上或徘徊在這荊棘之途的人們，警覺！感悟！懺悔！立刻止步，回過頭來，去接受固有的德性，去呼吸自然的空氣。</p>
<p>下列是道位失學小姐的原信。</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我並不是一個申請助學的人，却是同情一個申請助學者。當我看見十一日　貴報第七版所載一個女性申請助學者的家况，不禁觸起我的舊創，黯然淚下！在十年前，父親經商於滬，生活雖不算上乘，但也是一個中上之家，父慈母愛，那個不羨慕這四個大眞的女孩。好景不常，『只見新人笑，那見舊人哭」，這兩句話，竟就產生在這個美滿的家庭裏。</p>
<p>這是個恩將仇報的故事：我父親的愛人也就是恩將仇報的主角，却是我母親朋友的女兒，因家窮而求助於我母，要求介紹職業，我母親却是一個性慈軟弱的人，當時就令她做我家的敎師，這正好墮入他人的詭計，於是家庭的轉變，悲劇的產生，也就開始了。</p>
<p>初時父親把生活費時正時付，稍不如意，則把我們洩氣，輕則駡，重則施以夏楚，全無骨肉之愛。那時我只十歲，妹妹還只八歲，已嘗着失學的痛苦。一二八後，雖蒙恩給讀一年，可是十寒一暴，非但無進益，且更增了知覺的痛苦。</p>
<p>（幸而有傍觀者抱不平，憐我們遭遇，助我姊妹入學，但爲了時局的變遷，只完了一個小學黃金時期，就這樣過了。）每親却做了他們一個有食無工的廢人，因爲父親的經濟充足，性子也就隨了財力而轉變已忘記了什麼是夫妻，什麼是骨肉，怎樣叫五倫。開始給我母親以辱罵，甚至在我長姊出閣時，一毛不拔，不聞不問，而安享泰山，我母親是被舊禮教薰陶的人，只有逆來順受，委曲求生，以爲人性不會久滅，終有反省的一日，那知一切忍耐，都不能使忘恩負義的人，感到時自慚而　省啊！</p>
<p>八一三前，闔家返粤，那時父親現已起了遺棄的心，曾經一度避逃不成。至去年的一日，竟演了一幕逐妻棄兒的活劇·當時母親沒法，求之於訟，而父親竟仗金錢勢力，避而不見；登報詢質，回音杳杳，現在我們是無形中的脫離·姊妹努力担起了家庭的重任，以慰飽受滄桑的母親，我是一個被父親棄養的過來人，嘗受了這個家庭刺激失學的痛苦，所以我深　同情這個申請助學者。因爲我相信一個受過痛苦刺激的人，一定會潔身自好，努力上進，開發她新的生命·最後，我希望這位女士若得着了機會，好好的努力前進，將來爲社會發展以慰被棄的母親，莫受遣遺傳做一個不負責的人·</p>
<p>我以最誠懇最坦白的態度，說一句話，我知道先生是一個熱心社會的人，我希望借重大筆，（因爲我的筆，實在太拙了）。提醒一些只知色慾，忘了妻子兒女的人們，不要祇知自己享樂，不顧別人受苦，把責任忘了，把國家的大好靑年埋沒了。因爲正不知有多少人，受着道個痛苦呢！</p>
<p>文不通，語不順，有費先生寳貴光陰，抱歉抱歡。尙祈宥諒。此　撰安　失學者謹勒八月十二日</p>

<h3>知足和忍耐</h3>
<p>— 胡英</p>
<p>「知足常樂，能忍自安。」這是一副很標準模式的門聯，我們可以在人家的門上看見它。這話的意思，就是說：一個人只要能知足和忍耐，就可以享受歡樂和安適的生活。</p>
<p>我常見有些人，家境本很寬裕，因為不能知足，羡慕驕奢的浪漫生活，把所有的財產，從事投機，希圖僥倖成功。可是事實常和理想相反，他們非但沒　達到目的，反而弄得身敗名裂，懊悔莫及！這不是不知足的害處嗎？還有一些人，脾氣暴躁，稍遇不如意的事，就拍檯拍凳，咆哮如雷！一絲忍耐工夫都沒有，這當然也是失敗的，古語說得好：「小不忍則亂大謀」。像這樣的火氣，當然要影響他們的前途！</p>
<p>在目前，物價是何等的昂貴？父親維持家庭的開支，很不容易：我們對穿衣，吃飯等，都應該知足，但求溫飽。可是求學問是不能知足的，應該得寸進尺，欲望無窮，才有成就。切不可稍有所得，就目空一切，以為自己的學問已很廣博，要知道學問是無底的大海，你所學的，不過滄海一粟而已！</p>
<p>還有一點，我們應該記得，忍耐是有限度的！假使別人打你一拳踢你一脚，你就不妨暫時忍耐一下，別和他計較。假使別人要破壞你的名譽，應該發揮你所有的力量，抱着大無畏的精神，挺身和他們搏鬥，直到勝利為止！個人是如此，國家當然也是如此！</p>
<p>要之；知足和忍耐，都是我國固有的美德，除了求學部和萬不得已時，應該堅守不懈的。</p>
<h3>「開倒車」和「跳浜」</h3>
<p>— 尚恒</p>
<p>「開倒車」這三個字是甚麽意思？想是小朋友都知道的罷。一輛車子，不向前走，而却向後退；這就叫「開倒車」。譬如一個學生，去年在初小四年級讀書，今年退到三年級；明年他還想退到二年級；我們便說這個學生在「開倒車」。</p>
<p>「跳浜」，那又怎麽講呢？一個騎馬的人，見有一條浜橫在他　前面，他便不顧一切的策馬跳躍過去；這便叫「跳浜」。比方一個學生去年在初小三年級，今年他忽然跳到高小一年級；明年他還想考初中，我們便說，這個學生在「跳浜」。</p>
<p>「開倒車」是退化，我們應該極力反對的，我想信　個「開倒車」的人或學生將來在社會上一定要失敗的，衩淘汰的，因為在競爭的世界上只有適合時代潮流的人都有立足之地啊？</p>
<p>「開倒車」固然是退化，但是「跳浜」也很危險，一不小心，便要跌在浜裏。</p>
<p>小朋友們，現在有三條路給你們走，請你們用極敏銳的眼光和極正確的思慮來選擇一條你要走的路。那三條路便是：一條是「開倒車」的路，一條是「跳浜」的路，再有一條是「脚踏實地走去」的路。</p>
<p>照我看：上面　條路都不好，還是第三條路最穩妥，就是「脚踏實地走去」的路。</p>
<h3>海有沒有底</h3>
<p>— 張賢錦</p>
<p>一個早晨，海兒和他的弟弟敏兒一同坐在庭院中的池塘邊，一面看着起了淺波的綠綠的河水，一面却又談着天。</p>
<p>他們談着，談着，忽然談到海的問題，敏兒肯定地說：「哥哥！我信海是一定沒有底的。哥哥糾正地說道：「不，海是有底的。敏兒又不服道：「哥哥，你如不信，我們可立刻到海邊去探　一下」。哥哥解釋道：「敏兒，當我們到海灘上去探望時，因水太深，而且很污濁，故看不到海底了」，敏兒依舊不服地說：「不，我的問學也吿訴我海是沒有底的」。</p>
<p>二人互相爭辯着，誰都不願罷休。結果海兒想到了個好方法。</p>
<p>海兒說：「我們這樣爭辯下去是沒有結果的，那麽我們不妨去問爸爸吧」！敏兒聽畢，就理直氣壯地隨着哥哥一同去問他們的爸爸了。</p>
<p>他們找到了爸爸，敏兒首先　問道：「爸爸，海是不是有底的」？海兒正要辯護，然爸爸已開了口。爸爸公正地說：「敏兒，海却是有底的，這是經過許多科學家證明的，如大西洋最深處竟有四萬五千呎」。敏兒聽瞭這段話，祗得耳紅面赤　再到庭院中去玩了。</p>
<h3>有趣的雞蛋問題</h3>
<p>— 王亞僊</p>
<p>這天，天正下着雨，好玩的敏兒不能到外面去玩，在家裏正悶得慌，他哥哥聰兒就對他說：「我有一個有趣的問題，你能夠回答得出嗎？」敏兒說：「好，你　吧，是個怎樣的問題」</p>
<p>聰兒說：「一個賣雞蛋的拿了雞蛋去市上賣，他的第一個顧客買了他所有雞蛋的一半，另外還買半隻！他的第二個顧客也買了他剛剩雞蛋的一半，另外還買半隻，他的第三個顧客同樣地買他剩下來的雞蛋的一半，另外還買半隻，這樣他的雞蛋剛剛賣完，但是他並沒有敲碎過一隻蛋。你想想看，他一共有多少隻雞蛋」？敏兒聽了這問題，覺得很有趣，可是他想了一會，始終想不出，他便去問他哥哥到底那人共有多少雞蛋，他哥哥聰兒就說：「那人總共有七隻蛋，第一個人買他的一半是三隻半，再另外買半隻，合攏來不是四隻嗎，那他便剩了三隻蛋，第二個人買他剩下的一半，是　隻半，另外還買半隻總共是二隻蛋，那麽雞蛋便只有一隻剩下了。第三個人買他剩下的一半是半隻，另外加半隻，那不是剛剛一隻給他買去麽？這樣那賣雞蛋的不是把他的蛋全賣去，而沒有敲碎過一隻蛋麽」，敏兒聽他哥哥這樣一解釋，不由得恍然大悟，連連點頭。這時天已晴了，他便跑到外面去，把這有趣的雞蛋問題，去問他的朋友去了。（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3>害人反害已</h3>
<p>— 勳</p>
<p>從前有一隻居住在陸地上的老鼠，不幸的很，和一隻生平大半居在水中的蛙結成了知己的朋友。</p>
<p>有一天，那蛙存心不良，將老鼠的脚緊緊地縛在自己的脚上，兩種動物便聯在一起了，蛙最先引他那老鼠朋友，到他們慣常尋食的草塲上去。此後，他便引老鼠到他所住的池邊去，直到後來，蛙忽然往池中一跳，將老鼠也一同拖下了。那蛙得水，非常快樂，往來游泳，一面閣閣的叫，彷彿得了極大的勝利。</p>
<p>那不幸的老鼠，不一會就溺死在水裏，他的尸體仍縛在蛙的脚上，在水面上浮蕩着，一隻老鷹從空中看見了，突然飛下，用爪把他攫起，帶到半空中去。</p>
<p>那蛙因為仍緊縛在老鼠的腿上，也給老鷹帶去，當了點心了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們看了這個故事，覺得害人是有益的嗎？</p>
<h3>自製冰棒</h3>
<p>— 弼根</p>
<p>小朋友們！在這炎熱的夏天，不想吃些冷飲品解熱嗎？但是市上所售的往往不很衛生，我來吿訴你們一种自製的冰棒，方法很簡單，目頗　興趣：</p>
<p>預備：冰。氯化钙（化學工業原料行出售，約七八角一磅，可分三次用）。菓子露或煮熟的赤豆。鉛皮製的冰棒模型數隻，木箱。</p>
<p>製法：把冰敲成細塊，裝在木箱裏，拌以氯化鈣。把菓子露用冷開水調勻，放在模型內挿入一根小棒。把它挿在木箱內冰塊間，這時冰和氯化鈣起化學作用，能把箱內的溫度降低至攝氏零下五十度左右，菓子露即凝結成冰棒狀，把模型從箱內取出，往冷水中一浸冰棒即可取食。如果再要繼續時，可如上法泡製，箱內的冰塊等仍有效用。這樣可以做出很多的冰棒，一家都可吃到。並且這樣製出的冰棒很衛生，因為細菌在零下五十度不能生存。况自己親手做的東西，比較市上現成的，覺得更要好吃呢！</p>
<p>迷信</p>
<h3>工部局喇格納小學</h3>
<p>— 趙德茂</p>
<p>迷信是人不良的習俗，而尤以中國為甚，一年三百六十五天中，幾有三分之一的時候，化去在拜佛敎神與祭祖的上面。</p>
<p>今天偶然翻閱去年的日記，統計一下，竟使我發現一個可驚的結果——半年內做了三十三次的羹飯，（按即祭祖平均起來，差不多每星期有一次，若每次以二十元計，則不是需消耗一千元嗎？</p>
<p>家家戶戶若都能把這筆款項省了下來，則積少成多，積沙成塔，偵將全國省下的錢，作為保國衛民之用，則我敢說，我們決不致在此過這種痛苦的生活了。</p>
<p>但是，我看見現在仍有許多小路上，在打太平公醮，他們不但不「有錢出錢，有力出力」，而竟去幹此旣費錢又耗力的事，這眞是多嗎痛心的愚行！而且燄口每放至深夜，人常因此愛寒，若再吃此滿佈塵埃細菌的燄食，則時疫自必發作，口吐腹瀉，以至一命嗚呼</p>
<p>小朋友們，你可吿訴我嗎？這算保什麽太平（？）！</p>
<h3>問花</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>雖是一塊豆腐幹的小園地上，阿亮的爸爸到底還能種些花草，靠西的牆壁上攀滿瞭綠油油的牽牛花，東邊的木柵上蓋着了絲瓜的大綠葉，更自樓上引下了兩三根繩子，好牽引絲瓜和牽牛花爬上來；其他還夠這种矮樹木，再可容納着十多盆的草花。一到了夏天，滿眼碧綠，討人歡喜，就是在阿亮心目中也覺得怪可愛的，因此阿亮時常和它們在一起，宛然是做了很知己的朋友，他更對於他朋友——花木——的一切，認識了不少。</p>
<p>有一天，他爸爸正在整理：拔去花盆裏的野草，翻鬆泥土，排齊花盆。無意地他看見每一隻花盆底下都有一個洞。「這當然是恐怕花盆裏面的水太多，所以要有一個洞，可以放出過多的水分，但是花盆裏的水為什麽不能太多呢？」他心想到這裏，忽然竟想不出其中的道理來，於是他把這些向他爸爸說了</p>
<p>「這的確是很難回答的，要知道花盆里花草的根也是有生命的，它也需要呼吸，和我們一樣，所以花盆的泥土裏面，是應該讓空氣進去的，要是花盆裏的水，根來不及都吸完，便在盆裏剩下來，水過剩得太多，那盆裏完全被水佔居，空隙中全是水，泥土裏全是水，絲毫沒有空氣的存在的地位，因此花草的根便不能呼吸而被悶死，和人被水窒息而死一模一樣，最後那根便日漸腐爛，那棵花草也就死去，所以花盆底應該有一個洞，可以放出過多的水，一方面好讓空氣自由出進，我們把花盆塡高也是這個道理。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，你瞧這些花木都是綠色的葉，花是很少的。它們有這樣多的葉子有什麽用呢？」</p>
<p>葉子是花木最重要的東西，如果沒有葉，也沒有花木，花木所以能開花結果，一定需要太陽光和我們呼出的二養化炭氣，加上根在泥中吸收的水，運到葉子里來，要知道葉子裏有葉綠素，葉子能現綠色，全靠它。當太陽光一晒到葉子上，葉綠素便開始工作，把葉子吸收的二養化炭氧和不化合成花木的食料，所以葉綠素好比是一座機器，太陽光是燒的煤，二養化炭氣和水是原料，而製成花木的食料是它們的出產物。况且花木的食料也是我們的食料，不然，我為什麽要吃菜蔬呢？因為菜蔬中全是製造好的食料。花木吃了自己製成的食料，才能長大，所以葉子愈多，製造食物也愈多，花木的生長也愈快。」</p>
<p>後來他爸爸採了一些挿瓶花，供在書桌上，更覺滿屋好看得多了，可是一到晚上，有的花凋萎了；有的花便合閉而不開了，「這是什麼麽道理？」阿亮又去問他爸爸。</p>
<p>「這因為房間裏的空氣，很容易使花瓣乾燥，而且花梗在花瓶裏吸收的水分，還是來不及來滋潤這花瓣，所以供了不久，摘下來的花便凋萎了。那合而不開的花，明天或許會再開的，因為一到了夜裏，溫度降低，但花必需相當的溫度才肯開，到了夜裏，太陽光當然沒有，花也不肯開了。」</p>

<h3>好萊塢「兵工廠」</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>最近美國爲應付世局之緊張及預防一旦滴入戰禍起貝，對於擴充軍備可謂不遺餘力，凡爲國家或私人所辦的製造軍火的機關，今日已律受政府的徵用，努力生產。從此對於社會各階層倒並無行麽關係，而受到影響最大的則首推好萊塢，在未說明原因前，我且先請讀者閉目回憶一下。</p>
<p>平日我們在銀幕上不是常常能够看到戰事的塲面嗎？槍·砲·坦克車·甚至飛機，那一件不全備，那一件不逼眞，可是好萊塢叉不是兵工廠，那麽這些軍火是從那裏來的呢？原來就是向國內製造軍火的機關租來的；到了現在因爲政府限制供給私人利用，這樣好萊塢的影商，如果冉要製造戰事的塲面，不是發生了極大的困難嗎？</p>
<p>爲了補救的緣故，聰明的影商們已經眞的預備白設一兵工廠」，不過他們所製造的「軍火」，祇可以說是一種仿造品，這種仿造工業早在未限制前在好萊塢已很普遍，而至今允爲發達，從前他們祇能將輕便的軍火加以仿造，現在則已進步至能仿造飛機，而其中允以二十世紀福斯影片公同的出品最負盛名，並且產量方面亦很驚人。目前該公司正在仿製一種德國梅薩却密脫式的飛機，預備在一張新片內應用：，不久的將來我們當能在銀幕上看到似眞而非眞的飛機了？　最後可以順帶吿訴讀者的是影片內的所謂「鋼骨大厦」，及「裝甲輪船」，實在都是木製的，可是經過了一决油漆的工程後，就可以瞞過我們的肉眼；好萊塢影商的詭計眞是千變萬化的呢！</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Conference of England, America, and the Soviet Union Decided to Be Held in Moscow to Discuss War Equipment and Resource Allocation Procedures; England and America Will Send High-Ranking Representatives to Attend</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th -- During their meeting at sea, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill jointly telegraphed Stalin, proposing that high-ranking representatives from England and America meet with the Soviet government in Moscow to discuss important matters regarding aid to the Soviet Union. The telegram also offered assurances that the Soviet Union would continue to receive supplies as quickly as possible during the conference. The telegram stated, "Upon considering reports following Mr. [blank's] return from Moscow, we take this opportunity to discuss how our two countries can best assist your country in repelling the Nazi attacks. We are currently cooperating to provide your country with a stockpile of supplies that you urgently need. Many ships have already departed from our coasts carrying these supplies, and many more ships will follow immediately in succession. The needs of your country and your armed forces must be determined after careful consideration of many factors. For the sake of rapid decision-making on the allocation of our combined resources in all aspects, we now propose preparing for a conference in Moscow. We will send high-ranking representatives to attend so as to discuss this matter directly with you. If you agree with this, then we wish you to know that while the conference has not reached a decision, we will continue to provide your country with supplies and materials as quickly as possible. We must now turn our minds to considering more far-reaching policies, for a long and arduous journey lies ahead before complete victory can be achieved. Without complete victory, our efforts will be in vain. The war is being fought on many fronts, and while the war is not yet over, or new fronts may be discovered in newly developed areas. Although our resources are vast, they are ultimately limited. Where and when can our resources be most appropriately used to enhance our common efforts? This is of course a problem, as are the manufactured war equipment and raw materials. We deeply understand how important your country's brave and righteous resistance is to the failure of Hitlerism, so we feel that in any case we must act quickly and immediately to formulate a procedure for the future allocation of our common resources."</p>
<p>[Stalin] greatly approves of the suggestion to convene a conference of representatives from the three countries in Moscow to discuss the allocation of war equipment and has prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that this conference can be held soon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 16th -- Today, all Soviet newspapers prominently published commentaries on the historic meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, calling it of the highest political significance.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th -- Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that he hopes all civilized nations of the world, including the Soviet Union, can uphold the Roosevelt-Churchill joint declaration to destroy the Nazi reign of violence and rebuild a new world order.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 16th -- Yesterday, authoritative circles here commented on the possibility of Japan preventing domestic civilian ships from Vladivostok from providing aid to the Soviet Union, saying, "Britain will do its utmost to realize its policy of aiding the Soviet Union." However, no statement was made regarding what action Britain would take if Japan attempted to blockade Vladivostok.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 16th -- Simms, the international editor of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, reported yesterday that the "Anglo-American alliance" produced by the "Eight-Point Peace Declaration" can be expected to advance the war to its climax as soon as possible. He said, "If Berlin and Tokyo doubt President Roosevelt's determination to fight if necessary to end their intention to rule the world, then they are extremely foolish."</p>
<h3>Startling Action by the Two Countries; America Believes It Refers to the Far East Situation; Rumors Also Say British Troops Will Land in Northern Europe</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th -- A Reuters parliamentary correspondent said that after the announcement of the telegram from the two major leaders of England and America to Stalin, a portion of the many matters discussed at the maritime conference over several days has been disclosed. The eight principles agreed upon in three to five days are not the entire result of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Now that the eight principles have been issued, the important telegram has been made public within thirty-six hours. It is expected that the authorities will make other disclosures to supplement these eight principles. In summary, the sole purpose of the British and American authorities is to eradicate Hitlerism wherever it rears its head in the world. The phrase in the original telegram, "the war is currently being fought on many fronts and there may be future battles on new fronts," has already indicated this action.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th -- Last night, newspapers carried a news item claiming that U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill plan to suggest to Soviet Union's Stalin that a conference be convened in Moscow, with attendees including Stalin, his military leaders, and high-ranking U.S. and British officials. The New York Post headlined, "Three-Power Conference Planned in the Soviet Capital." The New York World Telegram anticipated that there will be startling action by the U.S. and Britain after the maritime conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th -- Observers here all believe that the Roosevelt-Churchill telegram to Stalin contains the first concrete action towards practically eliminating Nazi tyranny. The telegram clearly expresses the importance of providing the Soviet Union with critical war equipment, and the phrase "another battlefield" is widely believed here to refer directly to the Far East situation. Some quarters believe that the telegram is a warning to Japan that the two leaders have already agreed on an action. Observers also believe that the telegram reflects England and America's confidence in the Soviet Union's ability to withstand Germany.</p>
<p>International News Service, 16th -- After the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, talk of a British attack on Europe to aid the Soviet Union has intensified. All sectors believe that the British Prime Minister will take actions further than the declaration. The London Evening Standard predicts that invading British troops will land in "Murmansk" or "Archangel." It is said that the good opportunity to attack Norway and Holland and establish a second front against Germany should not be missed. The Daily Mail says that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill are currently "somewhere near the U.S. coast" and are jointly protected by British and American sea and air forces. The Soviet Union is constantly receiving reports regarding the progress of the conference.</p>
<h3>British Minister of Supply in Washington, Says Anti-Axis Countries Need Vast American Aid</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th -- The New York Times' Washington dispatch reports that Federal Loan Administrator Jones hosted a banquet this afternoon for British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook. Mr. Beaverbrook delivered a brief speech to U.S. defense officials, assuring them that Britain does not need American manpower to win the war and stating that he is deeply satisfied with the greatest possible material assistance the United States is giving to Britain. The list of British material needs that Mr. Beaverbrook presented has led some attendees to believe that the United States must expand its war equipment production to an extent that has only been imagined thus far, in order to assist not only Britain but also other anti-Axis countries. At the same time, it is said that the United States is currently planning to establish a better organization to handle the creation of the Distribution Advisory Committee, which will include representatives from the Chinese, British, and Soviet governments, as well as others who may resist the Axis in the future.</p>
<h3>America's Production Power Rapidly Increasing; Japan's Southern Advance Will Be Gradual</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th -- Speculation continues to swirl here about the possibility of President Roosevelt delivering an early "fireside chat." Generally speaking, America's industrial and war efforts are rapidly increasing to their maximum power. The extent of aid to Britain now exceeds what the American or British public imagines. This aid will automatically and gradually increase in quantity. However, it would be a mistake to hope that as a result of the Anglo-American joint declaration, the United States will take further action without Germany and Japan taking further actions.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 16th -- Well-informed sources here anticipate major international developments in the Pacific and Europe in the near future. Chinese observers still believe that although Japan speaks grandly of its southern advance program, it will currently proceed slowly to avoid a major war with England and America, while at the same time, it seems to be concentrating its efforts on the north in order to attack the Soviet Union's Far East Army. On the other hand, in order to protect its rear, Japan must consolidate its position in the South China Sea before launching a northern attack; this is the reason for Japan's occupation of southern Vietnam. These observers do not mean that Japan has no ambition to advance southward, but believe that the timing for this move is not yet ripe and will likely stir up trouble when England and America are occupied elsewhere, so that Japan can advance southward without risking war with England and America.</p>
<h3>Philippine General Election Approaching; Quezon Still Nominated as Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 16th -- The Nationalist Party Executive Committee nominated President Quezon and Vice President Osmena as candidates for president and vice president in the next general election. The election date has been set for November 11. The party platform has four main points: (1) Philippine independence; (2) democracy; (3) economic security; and (4) loyalty to the United States.</p>
<h3>Hiranuma's Injuries Not Serious</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 16th -- A statement released by doctors today said that Baron Hiranuma's condition is good.</p>
<h3>Japan Worried About Air Raids</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 16th -- The Japanese Domei News Agency announced last night that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is currently researching and promoting an air raid insurance plan, which will be based on the systems of the last and current World Wars, with insurance provided by private companies and compensation by the government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Evacuate Australia</h3>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 16th -- A Japanese ship carrying over a hundred Japanese nationals sailed from Sydney back to Japan yesterday. The final link in shipping between Australia and Japan has thus been severed.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Returns to Washington Today; Historic Voyage at Sea Comes to an End; Will Immediately Invite the Press to Talk</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th -- President Roosevelt is scheduled to land in Rockland, Maine, this afternoon, marking the end of his historically valuable voyage at sea. It is said that the President will return to Washington on Sunday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sippscott, Massachusetts, 16th -- The White House has issued hints that President Roosevelt may disembark from the ship today. Undersecretary of State Welles met with Hull yesterday morning for quite some time after returning to Washington from the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting.</p>
<p>United Press, Sippscott, Massachusetts, 16th -- Representatives of most major American newspapers gathered here today to await news of when and where President Roosevelt will land, as well as the release of details of the meeting between the President and British Prime Minister Churchill. It is reported that the President will immediately convene a press conference after returning to Washington. The President's special train is already waiting in Boston.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th -- According to a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, President Roosevelt will land in New York at around 6:00 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time), rest for two or three hours, and then take a train back to Washington.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th -- Republican House Representative Thill stated in the House yesterday that if President Roosevelt met with British Prime Minister Churchill outside of American territory, he was not acting in his official capacity. He pointed out that President Wilson's attendance at the Versailles Peace Conference in the past had been specifically approved by Congress.</p>
<h3>America Will Implement Commercial Pressure on Japan and Aid Free France; Purchase of Oilseed Vegetable Oil</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th -- Vice President Wallace confirmed last night that the Economic Defense Board will first focus on imposing commercial pressure on Japan and aiding Free French territories in Africa. However, he refused to discuss the details of this plan. The nature of the economic plan implemented against Japan has not been revealed, but it is reported that the government has various methods available to completely cut off commerce with Japan at any time. Japanese funds in the United States have been frozen and can only be used with the permission of the U.S. Treasury Department. All commerce with Japan is subject to export license restrictions, which can be used to completely halt commerce with Japan. The method of aiding Free French Africa is expected to be the purchase of palm oil and vegetable oil produced in central Africa. It is reported that the Free French forces have approximately 500,000 tons of this oil.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Anglo-American Talks and the Far East</h3>
<p>After the Roosevelt-Churchill talks became public, the world knew that the joint declaration issued by both sides was merely a form of "official statement," yet they still paid great attention to it. This is because the content of the declaration fully proves that England and America have decided to "cooperate to curb aggression, defeat tyranny, and establish a lasting peace with justice for all freedom-loving countries in the world." The essence of the eight points listed in the joint declaration is nothing more than this. At first glance, it seems like mere empty talk, but in reality, it demonstrates that England and America have the "ultimate determination and concrete plan" to spare no cost in jointly crushing the forces of aggression. This is not to say that England and America lacked determination or plans in the past, but it can be confidently asserted that after this face-to-face negotiation between the two leaders, anything that lacked coherence in the past will definitely be appropriately adjusted in the future, anything that was merely limited to the local level in the past will definitely be expanded into a comprehensive plan that is coherent from beginning to end, and anything that was still in the stage of deliberation and study in the past will definitely be put into practice at any time in the future. Moreover, the fact that the military chiefs of both countries took time out of their busy schedules to participate in the talks in person further proves that the scope of discussion and the decisions made by both sides will definitely not be limited to the eight principles seen in the joint declaration.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific decisions of this meeting, the officials have remained tight-lipped until now, and there is very little information from outside. According to the United Press, it is said that under the Roosevelt-Churchill agreement, the United States will focus its attention on the Pacific situation in the future, so that England and the Soviet Union can allocate greater strength to deal with Germany. Reuters speculates that this meeting will definitely involve three major issues: (1) the Atlantic War, (2) aid to the Soviet Union, and (3) the Far East situation. The former refers to the division of labor and cooperation, while the latter refers to the objects of discussion. Of course, both are possible. We believe that judging solely from the strict confidentiality of this meeting and the importance of the participants' positions, it can be asserted that the scope of discussion is very broad and the decisions made are not ordinary. Generally speaking, Roosevelt and Churchill comprehensively assessed all possible events that may occur in various parts of the world in the future, and then, based on the submissions of various experts, especially the military authorities, decided on a comprehensive plan to deal with each situation separately. However, since the United States is a democratic country and a neutral country that has always advocated the Monroe Doctrine, any measures decided by the President without the permission of Congress will inevitably be somewhat passive in nature. In other words, no matter how firm President Roosevelt's will is, under the limitations of the Constitution, he cannot rashly declare war on foreign countries or engage in actions that the opposition may accuse of participation in the war, unless the other party provokes first. Therefore, as far as the Far East is concerned, it is not difficult for us to imagine all the steps decided by the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. All economic sanctions and all assistance measures based on the Lend-Lease Act can of course be implemented step by step in an active manner in the future (the British announcement of the prohibition of exports to Japan and the arrival of American oil tankers in Vladivostok are clear evidence of this), but in the military aspect, both England and America—especially America—can only temporarily limit themselves to strengthening their own combat capabilities in dangerous areas and actively assisting other countries that are already or may potentially fight side by side, unless Japan dares to take any new actions. Specifically, unless Japan finally invades Thailand or carries out a northern advance, or even attempts to cut off the American aid route to the Soviet Union, the military actions against Japan agreed upon by the Anglo-American leaders a few days ago can be put into practice. Otherwise, one side will only step up its guard to block all loopholes that Japan can exploit, while the other side will continue to weaken Japan's remaining expansionist power in the economic and other aspects. It is like a poker game. Although it has now reached the "showdown" stage, the question is that China, England, America, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries are all watching Japan's final card, and the democratic front is by no means in a situation where it has no choice but to show its cards first.</p>
<p>The assassination of Hiranuma foreshadows extreme unrest within Japan, which will force the Konoe cabinet to take risks. If Konoe is still "undecided," causing extreme "dissatisfaction" among some military personnel, then Japan may be brewing a new cabinet crisis. Conversely, if Japan disregards everything and decides to act recklessly, then in this situation where the Anglo-American authorities have already formulated an entire response plan and all the democratic countries in the Far East are on high alert, one can sense that the mire Japan will encounter will be more than just China. These days, the Tokyo authorities are in this dilemma, and words like hesitation, anxiety, and doubt are probably not enough to describe their state of mind even by a fraction.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Northern Hubei Attacks Suixian County Seat; Japanese Transportation Line in Western Suburbs Destroyed; Japanese Army in Xinyang Repelled After Offending Northward</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News (1) The 16th Army of Zao Yang and a certain unit of the Chinese Army in Northern Hubei attacked Suixian County seat at 4:00 PM on the 13th, encountering the Japanese army at Wangjiatai in the western suburbs. Fierce fighting ensued throughout the night, and by dawn on the 14th, over a hundred Japanese were killed. The transportation route from the city to Leigudun was destroyed for several miles, and the unit returned with spoils of war. (2) According to a telegram from Guilo on the 16th, a Japanese warship with several motorboats arrived near Huang Gong Miao (west of Yueyang) on the 11th, shelling the shore and strafing with machine guns, attempting to land and create chaos. The Chinese army fiercely counterattacked, and the Japanese were unable to withstand it and fled. (3) According to a telegram from Heyuan on the 16th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Fanhe Dan, east of Danshui, on the evening of the 13th. The Japanese army hid in fortifications and did not dare to come out. The Chinese army left a unit to monitor and the main force detoured to Nianshanwei to attack, annihilating its guarding unit. The remaining Japanese in the fortress retreated. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Military News (1) The Japanese army in Xinyang, Henan Province, recently gathered more than 5,000 troops, with some cavalry and ten artillery guns, and began to create chaos starting on the 8th. On the morning of the 9th, they divided their forces and attacked Muyou River, Wujia Dian, Chenjia Dian, Chashan, Changping Pass, Gucheng, Heishan, and Shenyangtai (all northwest of Xiyang). The Chinese army counterattacked on all fronts, repelling the Japanese army. Due to the failed offensive, the Japanese army, in addition to using a unit to harass Zhu Lin via Yangjia River in an attempt to contain the situation, launched another full-scale attack on Shenyangtai and Chashan on the morning of the 11th in an attempt to succeed. The Chinese army's units on all fronts bravely contained the attacking Japanese army, while also dispatching a strong unit to detour and attack the rear of the Japanese army. Finally, on the evening of the 12th, the entire Japanese army was defeated. The part of the Japanese army that attacked Zhu Lin was also ambushed by the Chinese army, suffering more than half of casualties. The Japanese army retreated in disorder towards You River and Xinyang. The Chinese army's units on all fronts took advantage of the victory to pursue the retreating Japanese army, and by the 13th, the original situation had been restored. In this battle, nearly 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed and many spoils of war were captured. (2) The Japanese army that invaded south from Shashi, Cenhekou, Yizikou, and Qianjiang totaled approximately 6,000 troops. They were repelled by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army has now restored the situation before the war three days ago. In this battle, approximately 500 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the number of prisoners is still being tallied. (Telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>Enshi The Japanese army in Yichang launched harassment northward in the late last month, but was fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and was defeated. This time, the Japanese launched their offensive, first starting from the northeast of Yichang, with a total force of approximately 14,000 troops, gathering at Longquanpu, Yijia Zui, and other places. They began their northern offensive on the 27th of last month. After being contained and wounded by the Chinese army, reinforcements arrived the next morning. The Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce battles on the line from Changcen Gang, Wujin Shan, Tianxian Shan to Chenjia Tai. On the evening of the same day, the Chinese army captured Changcen Gang. The Japanese army suffered hundreds of casualties. Later, the Chinese army killed five to six hundred Japanese at Wujin Shan, Faguanquan, and other places. Afterwards, in order to give the Japanese a greater blow, they attracted the Japanese to the Gaoxia Shi and Fenxiang Chang areas on the 31st of last month, and then launched a fierce assault from the high ground towards the Japanese. They also ambushed the invading Japanese army along the way at Xujia Po, Shishan, Songjia Di, and other places, killing or wounding more than 2,000 people. The remaining troops retreated in disorder and were then ambushed by the Chinese, finally retreating to Yichang on the 6th and 7th, leaving corpses everywhere and turning the river water red. The Japanese army that attacked Zuojia Wan, Longwang Dong, and the Japanese army that attacked from Erliupo and Caojia Ya were also defeated by the Chinese army, with more than a thousand killed or wounded. In total, the Japanese suffered more than 5,000 casualties, including the early [blank] brigade commander and the East [blank] artillery battalion commander. Seventeen were captured and countless spoils of war were seized. The original intention of the Japanese this time was to achieve the goal of defending by attacking, but the result was ultimately crushed. (Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Commends Chongqing Air Defense Personnel, Allocates 300,000 Yuan to Distribute to Those Who Serve; Editor-in-Chief of Yishih Pao Killed in Air Raid</h3>
<p>Chongqing Official announcement today: Chairman Chiang, for the outstanding service of the air defense personnel in the recent air raids in Chongqing City, has specially ordered a donation of 300,000 yuan in national currency for reward. The Air Defense Committee now sells "air raid cakes" to people in air raid shelters during air raids. These "air raid cakes" are transported by trucks and sold at the entrances of major air raid shelters in the city. Before the implementation of the "air raid cake" plan, vendors brought large quantities of food and drinks to the entrances of air raid shelters, but people often could not bring them into the shelters in the short time before the air raids. As a result, those engaged in this business earned a hundredfold profit. (United Press, 16th)</p>

<h3>The United States Will Lead the Bulwark of Democracy, Britain and the Soviet Union Remain Vigilant in the Far East, China and Australia Welcome the Anglo-American Declaration</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 16th. Under the Roosevelt-Churchill agreement, the United States is expected to lead the bulwark of defending democratic politics and to watch the Pacific. Britain and the Soviet Union yesterday seemed to be preparing to focus their diplomatic attention on Iran. This does not mean that the vigilance of Britain and the Soviet Union in the Far East will be relaxed. According to reliable sources, the anti-Axis Pacific nations will continue to make maximum preparations against Japan. However, London and Moscow will have greater freedom to shift their attention to the unresolved issue of German activity in Iran. The United States will watch the Pacific. An authoritative statement said that Britain will do its utmost to fulfill its promise of assistance, indicating that democratic countries will not retreat if Japan attempts to pre-empt goods transported from Vladivostok. London's anxiety about Japan may be slightly reduced. The consistent "Open Door" policy of democratic countries in the Far East now seems to have greater significance, that is, Japan can improve its relations with Britain and the United States without sacrificing the Soviet Union and China. The door is now half open, but authoritative sources solemnly stated that this improvement should be initiated by Tokyo. Japan's recent outcry about being surrounded by the ABCD (America, Britain, China, and the Netherlands) countries does not cause ripples in the Thames. The fact that the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration did not specifically mention Japan is considered another manifestation of the democratic countries' efforts to avoid provoking Japan and their willingness to pay sympathetic attention should Japan suggest reconsidering its aggressive policies.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 16th. The most striking feature of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting is the eight-point program demonstrating the peaceful purposes of the two major democracies, but it is believed that other important issues must have been thoroughly discussed. The decisions made should be disclosed within days. It is speculated that the following three major issues were also discussed: (1) the Atlantic War; (2) aid to the Soviet Union; and (3) the situation in the Far East. Regarding the first point, the entire existing defense system will be revised. As for how to revise it, it is of course a confidential matter. In the future, Germany will learn at a heavy price the greater efficiency of the Anglo-American deployments. Regarding aid to the Soviet Union, consultations with the Soviet authorities are about to take place. Major British and American representatives will meet with the Soviet government to discuss obtaining rapid decisions and appropriate distribution of common resources. It is said that Hopkins is well aware of what the Soviet Union needs most, so it is in line with expectations that Britain and the United States will make suggestions to the Soviet Union along this line. As for the Far East, the continued arrival of reinforcements in the Far East shows that precautions are being taken. If the Japanese government is a little considerate, the British side has no tendency to take any steps that Japan may regard as provocative. At the same time, Britain and the United States are doing their utmost to accelerate the process of arms production.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 16th. All parties here warmly welcome the Roosevelt-Churchill statement. Semi-official sources say that this declaration demonstrates broad political skills and can promote closer cooperation among countries resisting aggression. Chinese political circles are particularly satisfied that Britain and the United States regard disarming the Axis powers after the war as one of their main war aims.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 16th. Australian Labor leader Curtin criticized the Roosevelt-Churchill statement, saying that this clear outline of goals is fully in line with the spirit and determination of the Australian Labor Party. I cannot imagine that any country, including Germany and the occupied countries, has trade unions that are not moved by this historic statement. All those who doubt that British and American workers have any other purpose in this struggle besides the righteous purpose of resisting aggression can forever dispel their doubts by viewing this statement.</p>
<p>German Criticism of the Anglo-American Declaration</p>
<p>World News Agency, Berlin, 16th. Since the release of the Anglo-American eight-point joint declaration, the German side has furiously denounced the democratic countries yesterday, calling the declaration a manifestation of the dark world order that the Axis powers are trying to destroy. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry shouted at President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, "If you want to disarm us, please take away our guns. Dare you?" The Nazi press fiercely attacked the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting and the Anglo-American joint declaration, denouncing them as "empty threats." A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said, "Now all of Europe can see what Europe will encounter if the democratic countries have a future in the world. Today's Anglo-American eight-point declaration is a shortened version of the fourteen-point program of the late US President Wilson. Since 1919, this program has often made the European air turbid. Now the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration repeats the old story, which is just right to show why the Axis powers should win. The democratic countries have now lifted the veil of their pretense and revealed their true purpose, which is more selfish than what was planned at Versailles."</p>
<p>United Press International, Berlin, 16th. Referring to the eight points of the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration yesterday, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that the joint declaration was in fact an event that no longer exists. Regarding the Anglo-American plan to launch a peace offensive, the spokesman said, "We only have one offensive, that is, a military offensive; only one purpose, that is, to annihilate the enemy; only one mission, that is, to achieve victory. Peace can only be discussed after victory." The harvest of the Atlantic Conference was the opposite of what everyone expected, because after listening to the propaganda from that side, people were all paying attention to the development of this "important event." Political figures in Berlin are quite satisfied that the representatives of the two major democratic countries have put Germany in a position of being propagated. The divergence of the goals of the two major politicians is quite noteworthy. Wales once talked about the League of Nations after the war, and Eden also proposed an international police organization with considerable power, but in the declaration, the so-called League of Nations or similar organizations were not mentioned at all. I don't know if this is due to Roosevelt's opinion or due to Churchill's opinion. The so-called "points" still remain in the declaration. Wilson was the inventor of these "points," but at that time, the number was slightly larger than this time, and the faces were also slightly different. Europeans still have a deep impression of this famous "point" and will never want to try this "point" again. The Foreign Ministry further believes that a point mentioned by a British news agency reporter earlier, that the meeting was initiated by Roosevelt, is extremely noteworthy. This reminds people of an idiom, that is, victory is obtained by everyone, and failure is not caused by everyone. People in Berlin said that the people of Germany and Europe can ask Roosevelt and Churchill in return, can all nations, regardless of size, strength, or weakness, actually obtain freedom of the seas in their new order; are Britain and the United States willing to give up their naval bases and maritime hegemony; is the United States willing to abandon its two-ocean naval plan without threatening Japan; are they willing to open up their resource-rich and sparsely populated areas to allow others to set foot; will Roosevelt hope to restore his Monroe Doctrine; what are Roosevelt's thoughts on the work of suppressing European Bolshevism; are Roosevelt and Churchill planning to abandon their blockade policy and prevent women and children from starving. If these questions are honestly answered, then this joint declaration will immediately be proven to be a fantasy. The people of Europe have already suffered from the experience of this kind of fantasy and do not want to taste its bitterness again.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th. The Anglo-American joint declaration on world policy has deeply angered the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese Times, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, published an editorial on Saturday morning saying that there is nothing new in the eight points of the Anglo-American joint declaration regarding Japanese policy. The newspaper mentioned the second point in the declaration, saying that Japan has no territorial ambitions, which can be evidenced by Japan's public stance towards China and Manchuria. As for the fourth item, Japan has always opened up access to natural resources on an equal basis. The newspaper also said that the ideal of disarmament is welcomed by the world, but any method found by international conferences has failed to implement it. This declaration can be regarded as having historical importance, because it is in line with the wishes that the Axis powers have already announced, but the methods are different.</p>
<h3>Australian Home Secretary Fowles Arrives in Singapore at Invitation, Commander of Australian Forces in Malaya Broadcasts, New Reinforcements Will Focus on Training</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 16th. Australian Home Secretary Fowles, at the invitation of the Malayan government, arrived in Singapore yesterday with a delegation of Australian newspaper reporters. Fowles said that the reinforcements arriving here fully represent Australia, and that the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration, which clarified several war aims, is extremely valuable. He believes this is a prelude to the future publication of more important declarations on war aims. In addition, Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces stationed in Malaya, broadcast to Australia last night, saying that the enemy may estimate the strength of its troops by the number of troops, but we estimate the strength of our army by spirit and determination. It is not as important to weigh the size of a dog in a dogfight. The tense situation in this part of the world is quite serious, but the arrival of well-trained and well-equipped reinforcements has increased our confidence in being able to deal with any enemy. All the new reinforcements know that the opportunity must not be lost and will focus on training together. The effectiveness can soon reach the same level as the troops that arrived here earlier.</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 16th. Observers here believe that the Roosevelt-Churchill joint declaration will enhance Thailand's resistance to Japanese pressure, because the declaration allows Anglo-American cooperation to curb aggression throughout the world. Senior authorities here said that this declaration was generally "expected to be aimed at Japan." What is worth noting is that in the past five days, the tension in Singapore has been slightly reduced. Newspaper reactions to the declaration vary. The "Straits Times" called it "the explosion of a wet firecracker" when everyone expected an explosion. The newspaper expressed disappointment that the declaration failed to show the extent of Anglo-American cooperation. The newspaper said, "We hoped that the declaration could take a firm stance against Japan and even issue a stern warning, telling it that it must stop aggression, otherwise it will be at odds with all of us, so that the situation in the Far East can be clarified." The newspaper believes that this English declaration has dispelled Japan's current fear of Anglo-American action in the Far East. The Japanese newspaper "Pioneer" interpreted the fourth declaration as a suggestion to Japan to "change its current course" in exchange for equal trading opportunities. The newspaper also said that this suggestion is worthy of the Japanese government's careful consideration.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Ukraine, Red Army Makes Strategic Retreat, Builds Strong Positions in the Dnieper River Bend, German Central Forces Encounter Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th. Recent Soviet communiqués state that there is very fierce fighting in Ukraine. According to London informed sources, the situation in Ukraine will inevitably be chaotic before it stabilizes. However, it is generally believed that General Budyonny will be able to withdraw his main force across the Dnieper River and then establish a strong defense line on the right wing to the west. The German offensive against Ukraine does not seem to be as certain as before. Last night, a German military spokesman said that military operations in the area had not yet been completed, and German field correspondents strongly stated that the troops were facing difficulties due to the fierce resistance of the Soviet army and heavy rain.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 16th. Soviet acknowledgement of the abandonment of Kirovgrad and Pervomaysk shows that the German army has crossed the key railway starting from Odessa and is now threatening the main railway line starting from Nikolaev. In the next few days, it can be seen whether the German offensive will succeed and achieve its initial goal of occupying the important industrial area within the Dnieper River bend, which includes the iron ore center Krivoy Rog and the Dnepropetrovsk industrial area. The German side claimed to have occupied Krivoy Rog, which produces a large part of the Soviet Union's iron ore, but Moscow denied it. The extent to which the Soviet army led by General Budyonny will strategically withdraw from the western agricultural areas of Ukraine to more defensible and more important areas will be revealed in the next few days. There are already signs indicating that the Soviet army will contain the German army along the line protecting the industry and use both ends of the Dnieper River bend as supporting points. One of the two large points is near Kremenchug and the other is near Nikolaev or Kherson. The purpose of this withdrawal of Soviet troops seems to be to avoid large-scale battles in the western part of Ukraine that is not suitable for defense, and now to hold on to the Dnieper River bend. In addition, the people in the industrial area are not only deeply patriotic but also loyal to the current government that has made the area's industry developed and prosperous. The ancestors of these people are mostly famous Cossacks, strong, good at fighting, and freedom-loving, who have resisted the aggression of Poland and Turkey for hundreds of years. Gogol wrote books that made the deeds of these Cossacks immortal. The area within the Dnieper River bend accounts for one-half of Ukraine's total industry, and the rest is in the Don River basin and other places east of the area.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 16th. An official message from the central front yesterday stated that there has been a drastic change in German strategy and they have now been forced to abandon their frontal attack on Moscow from Smolensk, because in the fierce fighting of the past thirty days, they have lost "tens of millions" of troops. At the same time, official communiqués stated that the Red Army engaged in fierce battles throughout the night in the Kholm, Staraya Russa, Smolensk, and Estonian regions. The Red Army air fleet assisted ground troops in attacking the enemy. The afternoon report from the High Command mentioned fierce battles in Smolensk and near three strongholds in Leningrad, which the Nazi forces are trying to encircle. The great battles in Ukraine were not mentioned.</p>
<h3>German Side Claims to Have Occupied Iron Ore Center in Ukraine</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th. The "Daily Mail" military commentator said that only Hitler and the German General Staff know whether the German offensive in southern Ukraine is a feint or a full-scale offensive. Judging from the current situation, the scale of the war is certainly quite large. In terms of mileage, the German right wing has made great progress. The Soviet side acknowledged that it had retreated from Pervomaysk and Kirovograd (120 miles north of Nikolaev), and seemed to be retreating to the back of the Dnieper Bay. The river is very difficult to cross. The Soviet retreat is obviously well-ordered, and there is no sign that the German army has approached the Dnieper River. The German side claimed to have occupied Krivoy Rog, the iron ore center southeast of Kirovograd. If this is true, the area is of no use to the German side, because what the German side needs is not iron ore, but oil. Even if the German army continues to make progress, it will inevitably find that the oil has been completely transported by the Soviet army. It is too early to say that the Soviet Union's communications have been cut off. The Soviet side can still transport troops by sea to reinforce and threaten the flanks of German traffic. There have been no significant changes in other parts of the front line, and there are no signs of launching a new offensive on a large scale. Soviet and German troops in the Smolensk and Kiev regions must be waiting for an opportunity to move. There is obviously some activity by Finnish troops, but there has been no major development.</p>
<h3>Nazi Blitzkrieg Tactics Fail, 6,000 Tanks Destroyed</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 16th. "Pravda" commented today that the German plan to break through alone with mechanized units has failed. In six weeks, the German side lost 15 brigades and 6,000 tanks were destroyed. The German side originally attacked with large tank units and infantry separately, but because this strategy has been defeated by the Red Army, suffering heavy losses, it has now had to change its strategy and attack with tanks and infantry together. The newspaper pointed out that at the beginning of the war, the German side often advanced with large mechanized units and infantry separately. The Red Army used this point to cut off their communications and defeat them separately. For example, the German 19th and 20th Tank Divisions were completely wiped out because of this. Finally, "Pravda" said that the situation in the German rear is unstable and it is impossible to compensate for the manpower and material losses suffered by the tank units.</p>
<h3>German Army Changes Strategy for Invasion of Soviet Union, Attempts to Cut Off Access to the Sea</h3>
<p>Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 15th. Today is the fifty-fifth day since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The general situation on all fronts is as follows: In the southern Ukrainian region, the German-Romanian allied forces are advancing steadily and have now reached Ask and Shmirke, 25 miles east of the port of Odessa on the Black Sea coast. At the same time, the vanguard of the German army is also advancing along the Bug River to a place less than twelve miles from the city of Nikolaev. Therefore, the people of Odessa and Nikolaev have had to evacuate. Another German force has advanced to Nikolopol, a famous manganese-producing area between the Dnieper River and Krivoy Rog. Fierce battles are currently underway. If the German army controls this area, it may be possible to attack the Crimean Peninsula. The Red Army encircled by the Black Sea ports is bravely retreating through the sea under enemy aircraft bombing. The war situation on the central front is more moderate, but Germany is intensifying its pressure on the Bryansk region. On the northern front, Finnish troops are attacking the northwest side of Lake Ladoga, allowing for the Vuksens and Sudavaara regions. The front line in the area is 150 miles long, and the Red Army has 50,000 soldiers and is strong. Looking at the overall war situation, it can be seen that the German army is trying to cut off the Soviet Union's entire access to the sea in the Baltic and Black Seas, isolating the Soviet Union from other parts of Europe.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 16th. Authoritative military commentators yesterday said that the German navy in the Black Sea cannot be considered strong, but the German military force in the Baltic Sea may threaten the Soviet fleet there. The commentator recalled that Germany could send warships through the Kiel Canal to attack Soviet warships. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union can transfer smaller warships such as submarines or destroyers from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea via the Stalin Canal.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Poland Sign Military Agreement: Southern Formation of Polish Army in Soviet Union; Molotov Receives Czech Envoy</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: Last night, London officials announced that the Soviet-Polish military agreement was signed in Moscow yesterday afternoon. This agreement is based on the principles formulated in London by Polish Prime Minister Sikorski and his staff and carried to Moscow by the Polish mission. It stipulates the details of forming a Polish army in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 16th: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, received Czech official Mr. Filinger today.</p>
<p>Stalin's Eldest Son Establishes Merit: Appointed Captain of Artillery Company; Unparalleled Bravery in Combat</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 16th: Officials announced today that Stalin's eldest son, artillery company captain Shugeshvili, established merit in the Battle of Vitebsk near Smolensk after 30 days of combat. General Yeriomenko telegraphed that "Artillery Company Captain Shugeshvili showed true bravery and love for the motherland while fighting near Vitebsk. He fought bravely and did not leave his position until the last shell was loaded." Official documents revealed that Stalin's eldest and second sons fought alongside the sons of famous heroes, Ukrainian guerrilla leader Chapayev and Pak Hong-min. Both heroes' daughters are officers. Stalin's youngest son, David, was captured by the German army at the beginning of last month.</p>
<p>Malayan Overseas Chinese Families</p>

<h3>Memories of Indian Poet Saint Tagore's Visit (3) Xu Baoqian</h3>
<p>"In the distant shadows of the forest, the red sun sets towards the banks of the Saraswati River. The hermits' children return from the fields to the silent forest garden, leading their tired oxen to rest in the woods. In the courtyard of the thatched cottage, the fire of worship burns. The children, having bathed, gather in the courtyard, quietly listening to Master Gautama's teachings. In the sky, in the infinite space, the God of Peace sits idly, as if in meditation. The stars surround the God of Peace, as if listening to the God's teachings. Suddenly, the quiet forest trembles, and Master Gautama speaks: Children, Mendea, I will tell you Brahma Vidya. Atop the trees of Tapovana, dawn arrives. The children of the hermits, rising early to bathe, their golden hair reflecting like dewdrops in the morning light. They surround Master Gautama under the Bata tree. Amidst the crowing, the buzzing of bees, and the sound of flowing water, they sing the Sama song in unison."</p>
<p>From this, we can not only see Mr. Tagore's educational ideals, but also the philosophical foundation of Mr. Tagore's educational career.</p>
<p>Political Thought: Mr. Tagore's forest school was founded in 1901. Not long after, the national independence movement arose. Although Mr. Tagore sympathized with nationalism, he had already clearly seen its drawbacks. As early as 1901, Mr. Tagore had clearly said: "Nationalism is based on the blind pursuit of self-interest by each nation. So-called patriotism is nothing more than each nation's arrogance and contempt for other nations. It has a close connection with force and untruth.</p>
<p>In 1916, Mr. Tagore traveled to Japan and the United States. Seeing the peak of nationalism in both countries, he earnestly warned the people of both nations.</p>
<p>In 192x, Mr. Tagore came to China, and the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association held a meeting to welcome him. In his speech, Mr. Tagore said: "When I traveled to your country, I saw some Westernized politicians. Their purpose is nothing more than to expand their own country's power and exclude other countries. This narrow nationalistic ideology is the enemy of idealism and the natural result of the mechanization of life." In the same year, Mr. Tagore also said in a speech at the British-American Association in Beijing: "When I passed through Japan, I saw the so-called 'spoils of war' obtained from China openly displayed. I really don't understand what this boasting means. I also questioned several Japanese friends, and they said that this kind of education is necessary to prepare the people for foreign wars. They also said that in order to make the people love their country, it is necessary to arouse the people's hatred of foreign countries. However, in my opinion, this is nothing more than a revival of barbarism, and its consequences are very terrible. Fortunately, Japan has other lovable aspects. The ordinary people of Japan are extremely polite to people, they admire ancient customs, love a quiet life, and their lives show an artistic spirit everywhere. All of these are the opposite of belligerent nationalism."</p>
<p>Mr. Tagore also said: "In the United States, I also saw the same situation, the spirit of excluding foreigners can be seen everywhere. I don't think this is what a Christian country should have. Moreover, this spirit can lead mankind to the road of destruction. Even modern India has the same trend. When I pointed out the danger of this tendency to Indian nationalists, they blamed me for weakening the Indians. Because what they worship is the principle of survival of the fittest and the strong preying on the weak."</p>
<p>International Mission: Because of the prevalence of nationalism, after returning to China from Japan and the United States, Mr. Tagore deeply believed that it was necessary to promote ancient Indian culture. Therefore, at the end of 1918, he gathered his former students and friends in Santiniketan. At the meeting, Mr. Tagore announced his proposal to reorganize the original school to make it a center for promoting ancient Eastern civilization, and changed the school name to Visra-Bharati, taking the meaning of gathering world scholarship in one place (that is, the meaning of an international university). After the end of World War II, Mr. Tagore traveled to Europe again in 190x (according to Mr. Tagore, he traveled to Britain and Europe in 193x, that is, Mr. Tagore's trip to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature for writing Gitanjali), and was greatly welcomed by people from all walks of life in various countries. The result of this trip further strengthened his long-held belief that Eastern civilization can make important contributions to all mankind.</p>
<p>When Mr. Tagore was traveling in the United States (1916), he met a British youth, L.K. Elmhist, who volunteered to help Mr. Tagore with rural work. At this time, Mr. E. fulfilled his promise and came to work at Mr. Tagore's place. Therefore, when Mr. Tagore returned to China in January 192x, he formulated three great plans: (1) Promote Eastern civilization at the International University, (2) Experiment with rural improvement work near the International University, and (3) Promote human harmony and reconcile Eastern and Western cultures through the International University.</p>
<p>Late Years Honors: Mr. Tagore traveled to China in 1924 and to Soviet Russia in 1930 (details are included in the appendix to this article).</p>
<p>In May 1936, on the occasion of Mr. Tagore's 75th birthday, congratulatory telegrams came from all over the world, honoring Mr. Tagore as a great poet, great playwright, great novelist, social reformer, and religious master. In the summer of 1937, Mr. Tagore recovered from a serious illness. At the time of the Japanese invasion of China, Mr. Tagore drafted an article denouncing its brutality. In the winter of 1938, Mr. Tagore's paintings were exhibited in London. In May of this year, Oxford University in England broke with precedent and held an honorary ceremony in Santiniketan, where Mr. Tagore lived, and awarded him an honorary doctorate in literature. On August 7, Mr. Tagore died in Calcutta, and people from all over the world mourned him in unison.</p>
<p>Mr. Tagore was born into a prominent family, and his family produced many religious figures, philosophers, artists, and writers. Mr. Tagore was indeed the leader of the family, his brother Dwinidranath was a philosopher, and family members Sogonendranath and Abanmdranath were all artists. As for Mr. Tagore's daily living habits: his diet was mainly milk, sugar vegetables, and vegetables, but he did not eat meat. He got up early in the morning at all times of the year, and after getting up he would pray, praying for peace in the world. He would take a walk outdoors at sunrise, regardless of the cold or heat. He worked during the day, either reading books and writing poetry, or writing articles and painting. In the evening, he would gather male and female students to sing the poems and songs he had written, and the sound would overflow in all directions. When a new article was completed, he would give a lecture, and his voice was clear and loud, like the great bells.</p>

<h3>United States Strengthens Military Preparedness to Ensure National Security: Secretary of War Stimson Delivers Broadcast Stressing the Need to Extend Military Service</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th: Secretary of War Stimson warned yesterday that "the Western Hemisphere is an unavoidable target of aggression by totalitarian countries," and that the world is now facing "the most dangerous threat in history." Mr. Stimson's remarks were broadcast to American soldiers, explaining the need to extend military service to 18 months. Mr. Stimson said that the government does not intend to send any expeditionary forces to fight for other countries. What the government is planning is to train a self-defense army to ensure the safety of the country. The danger is very real and rapid. Any government that does not take this step is shirking its responsibility. Mr. Stimson also said that Germany, Italy, and Japan are all thinking of conquering the world and trying to restore the "customs of the Dark Ages."</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 15th: Secretary of War Stimson recently issued a message to the army, stating that the United States is training troops to defend the country and prevent it from being attacked. The most dangerous place in the Americas is actually South America and Central America. If the Axis air force and the "Fifth Column" cooperate to gain a foothold on the South American coast, it will be difficult for us to deal with it. Moreover, after the enemy establishes a foothold in Central or South America, it will be easy to bomb the Panama Canal. There are many signs that the Axis powers are invading South America. The authorities of Latin American countries have repeatedly uncovered foreign espionage conspiracies, which are examples of this. Germany is now in a very difficult situation. If it cannot advance and plunder new spoils, it will have internal unrest and defeat. German spies have been very active in the Western Hemisphere recently. The direction of the country's future actions is self-evident. The situation in Japan in the Far East is also the same. The country has already stationed a large army in China, and is now seeking new developments to the south. Moreover, the country's joining the Axis alliance is clearly aimed at infringing on us and our interests. The natural resources of our Western Hemisphere are also the ultimate target of its aggression. If our government still does not take steps to protect the country, it will be violating the interests of the people.</p>

<h3>U.S. Army Enlistees Undergo Physical Examinations: 6 Million Rejected Due to Unsoundness</h3>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 16th: Federal Security Administrator McNutt suggested yesterday that an estimated six million enlistees have been rejected due to poor physical condition, so the Selective Service Act should be changed. Mr. McNutt said that "America's reproductive power" has been "disappointing." Mr. McNutt is now proceeding to request Congress to allocate funds to treat those who have been rejected so that they can also be trained. According to Mr. McNutt's plan, local officials should first allow those who have been rejected to improve their physical condition within a specified period of time, and then give them a second examination. Mr. McNutt said that those who are rejected due to unsound physical condition account for 40 percent, but the conscription office said it is 32 percent.</p>

<p>Reuters, Beirut, 16th: General Tagore broadcast last night in response to Marshal Pétain, saying, "We, from this side of the Mediterranean, reiterate our assurance to serve France and seek France's liberation." Mr. Tagore, representing the Free French who will never surrender or cooperate with the enemy, denounced the policies of Vichy, saying that the Free French continue to fight for revenge, greatness, and freedom, and that the Germans, who win by unexpected and rapid action, will eventually not be able to escape their fate.</p>

A Free French radio announcer recently suggested in a broadcast that the letter T be used to represent traitors. The letter T should be painted on the doors of French people who serve the Germans. The letter T is the first letter of Traitor. According to the Free French intelligence agency, the first traitor mentioned by the announcer was a wholesaler named Van Li at 33 Monk Street in Bordeaux, France, who goes to non-occupied France every week to buy 30 to 35 tons of meat to sell to the Germans. This matter was announced during the broadcast at 9 p.m. on August 5. The next morning, 3,000 women in Bordeaux angrily destroyed Van Li's residence.

<h3>Food - Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Price Suddenly Rises Eight Yuan - Grain Hoarders Overjoyed</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market turned tight the day before yesterday, and the sentiment remained buoyant yesterday. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Council's small grain public sale price suddenly rose by 8 yuan to 124 yuan. It is also rumored that the 40,000 to 50,000 bags of rice they have in stock have also been raised in price in succession before and yesterday. Retail and wholesale prices are close to the market price, immediately causing excitement among the speculator gangs. Local grain hoarders also took the opportunity to hoard, their faces beaming with joy beyond description. The shouting started again, and the situation became chaotic again. The bank's warehouse small grain price jumped to 127 yuan, and foreign warehouses to 126.5 yuan. Other No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon cargoes all soared. No. 1 Saigon high-grade cargoes opened at 139 yuan, the general market at 136-137 yuan, and central warehouses at 134-135 yuan. No. 2 was at 127.5 yuan, and old goods at 129 yuan. Central warehouse No. 2 Siam was at 121.5 yuan, Gia Vot rice at 135.5 yuan, high-grade Min Dang at 139 yuan, central warehouses at 134-135 yuan, and secondary grades at 129 yuan to 127.5 yuan. At this point, general retailers slowed down purchases due to the shocking prices, while most speculators, seeing that the rising trend had weakened, rushed to sell at high prices, and the market softened again. Various prices fell by one yuan, with the bank's warehouse small grain price at 126 yuan, and foreign warehouses at 125 yuan and 124.5 yuan. This situation persisted for a long time until near the close of the market, when new major hoarders emerged and absorbed the supply, causing the market to tighten again. Therefore, the closing price was still about one yuan higher than the previous market. As for the current stock in Shanghai warehouses, it is known to be 1.21797 million bags. The Shanghai Municipal Council is still selling, and the auction price is still lower than the market price. However, rice shops in the French Concession, due to the price limit set by the French Municipal Council, have a large price difference and are unwilling to buy. Since the market lacks actual sales, it is unknown whether the speculator gangs can sustain their business. However, recently, rice merchants have been trying to use the "Southward Advance" as a pretext to make a move. The Shanghai Municipal Council rice price rose eight yuan without saying a word, which is nothing short of providing ammunition for rice weevils and hoarders, giving them a reason to argue loudly and add fuel to the fire. It is hoped that the Shanghai Municipal Council will act cautiously in the future, so that rice hoarders will not laugh behind their backs, and the public will not be disappointed, thinking that this is just business.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica national rice was stimulated by the movements in foreign rice, and the arrival of goods suddenly became scarce again, which made local shops more eager to stock up. The owners took the opportunity to raise prices, and prices rebounded by two to three yuan. South China's fresh early and late indica rice opened at 55 yuan, or 154.5 yuan. Wuxi's original-package special japonica rice was at 54-55 yuan, and lodging and secondary grades were attached at 17 yuan to 114 yuan. Only ten stones of new Pudong japonica rice arrived, and in the context of strong sales, it was not enough to distribute. Therefore, the goods were sold at the current time when goods were scarce and valuable, and prices immediately rose by more than three yuan, with the opening price at 60 yuan to 159 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also followed suit in this favorable situation, and prices generally rose by about one yuan. Hong Kong white yuan high-grade opened at 129 yuan, and secondary grades at 125 yuan. Glutinous tea was at 117 yuan to 114 yuan. As for national glutinous rice, no transactions were heard due to a lack of goods.</p>
<p>Flour Market Steadily Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot foreign flour market saw continuous gains in sales from the northern and southern foreign transshipment gangs. Although arrivals were continuous, the rising exchange rates and the news that the Shanghai Municipal Council increased the price of flat-rate rice both excited people. Speculators inside and outside the industry took the opportunity to push up prices with all their might. Although the newly arrived goods of the Golden Dragon brand are in the Pudong warehouse, they are quite popular with buyers due to their better quality. The opening price was 33 yuan and a ball and corner, gun powder flour at 3.394-6 yuan, and banana flour at 34.1-4 yuan. A total of more than 30,000 bags were traded, and the selling price was increased by six to seven corners compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Oil Market - Soybean Oil Market Not Public - Only Rapeseed Oil and Clear Oil Are Traded - Hoarding is Even More Effective</p>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market saw soybean oil still hoarded and not traded. The buying interest in rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil remained strong. Both the Dah You factory's clear oil and the Ri Hua factory's rapeseed oil opened at 200 yuan. Subsequently, the market slightly eased as profit-taking hoarders sold off their stocks. As a result, the price rose by one and a half to five yuan compared to the previous day. A total of more than 1,000 dan of Dah You factory's clear oil, 600 dan of rapeseed oil, more than 2,000 dan of Ri Hua factory's rapeseed oil, 300 dan of Li De factory's rapeseed oil, 100 barrels of Yoshida factory's rapeseed oil, and 50 barrels of Da Sheng factory's rapeseed oil were traded (price details in the market price column).</p>
<p>The price of soybeans continued to rise. Yesterday, because those holding the goods continued to hoard, there were very few sellers, and the price rose by another one or two yuan. The general market saw the Main Street and South China gangs buy 500 bags of degummed Jiaozhou soybeans at a price of 59.8 yuan, 100 bags of Qingkou soybeans at a price of 58 yuan, and 300 bags of Guide soybeans at a price of 56 yuan to 57.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Financial Settlement Still Strong - Foreign Exchange Tightens</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw tight exchange rates. At 9:30 AM, only the Hong Kong exchange rate was lowered to 125, amounting to 19 yuan. French, German, and Japanese exchange rates were still inactive. The British and American exchange rates remained level. The black market for British and American exchange rates remained tight. After the morning opening, banks offered little supply, causing the American dollar exchange rate in the foreign bank to fall from 4.78125 to 4.75 at one point. The British pound had no price. The HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate remained at 4.8125, and the buying pressure stopped. However, after 10:00 AM, HSBC suddenly settled imports for sugar and hardware merchants, and the HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate also changed to 4.75. The market tightened again until the close, with both exchange rates rising again compared to the previous day. Trading was not very active. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sino-American Commercial Sales Have Strong Supply</p>
<p>Since this morning's foreign wire report, the silver market in England, America, and India has not changed. The American exchange rate against the British pound was lowered by 0.25, and the American exchange rate against Shanghai was lowered by 0.02. The rest were unchanged. The central exchange rate remained level. In the morning opening, the selling prices of banks were level. The spot British exchange rate was 1 shilling 875, and the American dollar was 4.815 yuan. The importing foreign bank came and bought August at 4.78125 yuan. After the American bank supplied, sales stopped, and the market softened to 4.75 yuan. The HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate remained at 4.8125 yuan. Anglo-American commercial banks supplied at the above price, and the buying pressure stopped. The price rose sharply to 4.84375 yuan. The silver balance tax remained slightly at 24.25%. HSBC suddenly absorbed American dollars at 4.8125 yuan on behalf of importers. The market became hot again, and importing foreign banks competed to absorb the supply. Near noon, Chinese and American banks showed some willingness to supply, so the market stabilized. At the noon close, the spot and September futures British exchange rate was 2 shillings 84375, and the American dollar was 4.78125 yuan, both rising by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises by Two Yuan</p>

<p>The Gold Rush Intensifies - Spot Gold Nears 9,000 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw intense activity in the black market, with the waves still dangerous and the fluctuations violent and unexpected. After rising, the market once fell sharply, then resumed its upward trend. After returning to the 7,200 yuan mark, it jumped out again. People were a little uneasy. The HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate initially remained at 4.8125, and the black market turned from tight to level. There was a lot of infighting in the market, and the price rose to 7,230 yuan. It once retreated sharply to 7,170 yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC suddenly bought American dollars on behalf of importers, and the market tightened again. Amid the closing price frenzy of gold shops and securities firms, it rose again to 7,265 yuan, an increase of 96 yuan. The volume of trading in half a day was 140,000 to 150,000 taels.

Gold jewelry rose by 20 yuan, reaching a peak of 921 yuan, which has never been reached before.</p>
<p>Futures Gold Rises Sharply by Nearly 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM and immediately rose to 7,185 yuan, an increase of 33 yuan. Then, it retreated from 7,190 yuan to 7,180 yuan. The foreign exchange reported tight, and it was difficult to settle at 4.78125 yuan for the American dollar. People were encouraged, and amid the buying pressure from Tong Kangyong, Xianghe, Yifeng, and Yida, retail investors followed suit and pushed up the price by 50 yuan to 7,230 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the HSBC small counter's Wan Yuan remained at 4.8125, and the black market also turned cheap. Retail investors rushed to sell, and Xinfengyong, Yida, Yifeng, Yiyuan, and Defu all sold, causing a sharp drop of 20 yuan to 7,170 yuan. Dafeng, Hengji, Chida, and Dingsheng absorbed the supply at the lower price, so the price gradually rebounded. After 10:30 AM, HSBC absorbed American dollars at 4.8125 yuan, suddenly turning tight, and the price soared above 7,200 yuan. Yida, Chengji, and Defu bought aggressively, soaring to 7,218 yuan. Yili, Yiyuan, Xiangxingyong, Xinyuan, and Xinfengyong competed to sell at the high price, retreating to 7,215 yuan. The price then rose again due to the buying pressure from gold shops and securities firms. The market closed at noon at 7,248 yuan, an increase of 96 yuan compared to the previous day's closing, representing a squeeze of 35 yuan. After the close, Hesheng, Yida, and Chengji bought in, rising to 7,265 yuan. There was a difference of 90 yuan in half a day. In the afternoon, the off-market price rose again to 7,275 yuan.

<p>American Dollar Swap Still Posted by Shorts</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both spot and futures prices rise sharply. British and American gold pounds also rose sharply by 15 yuan, and the trend of British gold notes was also firm. The evening market rose to 47 yuan. American dollar notes opened at 1,040 yuan. After opening, Dagong, Lianhe, Liji, and others bought, raising the price to 80 yuan. Xiangxing sold, retreating to 2,078 yuan at the close, an increase of 13 yuan compared to the previous day. The current swap was posted by shorts to longs, at 9 points per 100 yuan.

In addition, notes from Singapore, Robbie, Canada, the Philippines, Australian gold, and Siam all tended to rise.</p>
<h3>Securities - Government Bonds Fall Frequently - New Low Prices Seen Repeatedly</h3>
<p>The government bond black market gradually declined yesterday. Class A bonds broke the 6 yuan mark, Class B bonds broke the 1 yuan mark, Class C bonds once broke 7 yuan, and Class E once broke 6 yuan, the new low price since the Class A bond lottery. It is clear that there are very few who borrow to short. Most of the large numbers that appear are actual goods flowing out, with no need to cover, so trading is greatly reduced. Most of the trading now done in the market is by long speculators, with Class A longs selling, and the market falling. Class B longs are trapped, and Class B are sold to Class C, in a cycle. Occasionally, new longs join, and the market is slightly better, but actual goods are sold off when the opportunity arises, so there is not much hope for the future. The root cause is that there has been a sudden change in the 11th installment of principal and interest due at the end of July, causing people to doubt. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held in the morning. Runli and Runde bought slightly more, followed by Lianyi and Lianhe. Tianxing bought Class A bonds, but Hongda and Zhongfu Bank and Xinhua Bank supplied a lot. Xiexingyuan and Defu also had actual goods flowing out. The market price felt sluggish from the opening, and all markets broke through a level. The situation had weakened, and the results were all down by 0.3, 0.5, or 0.6 yuan. The total volume of transactions was less than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 100 shares of the New New Company traded at a price of 28.25 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Friday) - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks remained level today. Bank stocks alone showed weakness. The Macau Bank stock rebounded by 1 shilling 3 pence to 8 pounds 18 shillings 9 pence. HSBC Bank shares each rose by 1 pound, with the London registered share price at 74 pounds and the Hong Kong registered share price at 77 pounds. There were bids, no offers, and no other changes.</p>
<p>Coal - White Coal Dust Increases by 10 Yuan - Still Not Willing to Sell Much - Fu Coal Balls Will Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Hongji No. 2 white coal dust, the only raw material for coal balls, had abundant supplies arriving in Shanghai in the past two months, and the warehouses were very full. Currently, the managing firms are using the pretext that the cost of later goods is high, and the price of coal dust has risen from 330 yuan to 340 yuan, and has increased by another 10 yuan, but they are still not willing to sell much. Therefore, it is rumored in the market that coal balls will soon continue to rise in price, which is not a worrying factor.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Raw Cotton and "Power Too Strong," Transactions Outside the Market Reach 1,700 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market started flat and continued to rise, but the upward trend was very strong. This was because the price of 32-count single yarn was high, and at the same time, the price of raw cotton was also rising strongly. As a result, speculators concentrated on buying, and for a time, there were not enough chips to distribute. As for the shorts, most of them reversed their positions to long. As a result, the market gradually rose. However, actual sales of 20-count yarn were still very few, but the recent increase was very significant. Once those who have made profits sell, a sharp reaction is feared and must be guarded against. Unexpectedly, people's hearts are currently enthusiastic, and the public's attention is focused on cotton yarn. The high price for 20-count Double Horse brand was 1,684 yuan, and the low price was 1,643 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the usual weekend market closure, several dozen bales were traded in the unofficial market, reaching over 1,700 yuan. Afterwards, 1,695 yuan could not be sold, exceeding the high price of 1,685 yuan on the 28th of last month. The exchange will officially open for business next Monday. Speculators buy more as prices rise and sell heavily when prices fall. It is reported that 670 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Double Horse brand opened in the morning, and due to rumors that cotton yarn could not be shipped from the Burma Road, some people's confidence was shaken. The opening price was only 1,643 yuan, but sellers in the market were not aggressive, and the market rebounded, gradually rising. It was then heard that the exchange was buying in large quantities, and the market rose further, with buying interest even stronger, rising step by step to 1,684 yuan. In the middle, due to profit-taking, it fell back to 1,676 yuan. The closing price was 1,682 yuan. It is reported that the turnover for the half-day was 7,685 bales. The amount of purchases by various groups is listed below: Hong Kong 185, Fellow traders 7, Our statistics 7,650.</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry Joint Exchange will start business on the 18th of this month. The business hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily, with the afternoon temporarily closed. The location is on the upper floor of the current yarn market in Tonghe Gully.</p>
<p>The gold futures market again experienced a sharp and violent rise amidst the softening of American cotton. At the opening this morning, due to the strength of dyed cloth and factory orders, futures prices immediately rose by more than ten yuan. The sentiment in the futures yarn market was revitalized, with longs frequently adding to their positions and shorts feeling shaky and eagerly covering their positions. In addition, with the manipulation of speculators, the entire market was dominated by buying interest, and the supply of chips was short. Market prices rose continuously, showing a tendency to soar. The August contract opened at 1,485 yuan, a slight increase of two yuan; the September contract was 1,576 yuan, an increase of eight yuan; the October contract was 1,591 yuan, a gain of seven yuan. Afterwards, due to the continuous surge in factory orders, and rumors of Hong Kong buyers purchasing fine yarn, demand increased sharply, and the potential for price increases expanded. Shorts, seeing the unfavorable situation, rushed to cover their positions, and buying interest was strong. The August contract rose to a new high of 1,509 yuan, the September contract to 1,595 yuan, and the October contract to 1,608 yuan. Due to some profit-taking selling by the longs, there was a normal small correction of three to six yuan. The afternoon closing prices were: August contract 1,503 yuan, September contract 1,589 yuan, and October contract 1,607 yuan, each up 20 to 23 yuan from the previous day. Turnover for the August contract was 1,880 bales, for the September contract 5,230 bales, and for the October contract 5,150 bales, totaling 13,260 bales. This was a decrease of 3,870 bales from the previous day. In the afternoon, due to Saturday events, and the quantity of three-month accounts ending on the 15th was 22,620 bales, including 3,910 bales for August, 9,540 bales for September, and 9,170 bales for October. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the morning half-day are recorded below (net closing prices):</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Pushed Higher and Higher, Exceeding Overseas Order Prices</p>
<p>The current cotton situation has a solid base and prices are high, but speculators are pushing prices aggressively, so the upward trend is strong. However, prices have been pushed above overseas order prices, and the supply of cotton is still smooth. It is inevitable that things have gone too far. However, this is often the style of speculators, who want to push prices high enough. Once they release, prices will plummet. Therefore, yesterday's turnover was slightly lower than before, and many holders are still unwilling to sell at this high point. New highs are intermittently being reached. The market prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>The buyer is responsible for handling the delivery permits for shipments arriving successively in August and September.</p>
<p>New York cotton market, telegram of the 15th. The market rose initially due to purchases by traders, then fell back due to long liquidation and sales by the New Orleans group. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by three to eight points from the previous day. Spot Middling cotton sold for 16.65 cents per pound, equivalent to 379.62 yuan per picul in the local market.</p>
<p>Also from New York, the Bureau of Statistics released the following cotton industry statistics for July in the United States (unit for cotton cloth: thousand bales; unit for spindles: thousand): Item | July This Year | July Last Year | Cotton Cloth Consumption | 929 | 598 | Seed Cotton Consumption | 124 | 80 | Cotton Cloth Exports | 33 | 120 | Cotton Cloth Inventory at Factories | 1,874 | 974 | Cotton Cloth Inventory at Warehouses | 9,704 | 9,122 | Spindles in Operation | 23,028 | 12,917</p>
<p>Also, a telegram of American cotton statistics from August 1st to 15th this year is recorded below (per bale of 500 pounds): Cumulative Arrivals | 268,000 bales | Cumulative Factory Use | 356,000 bales | Cumulative Exports | 28,000 bales | Total Inventory at All Ports | 3,248,000 bales</p>
<p>The Bombay Indian cotton telegram did not arrive yesterday. According to its unofficial market prices, prices fell by 2.5 rupees. Broach cotton sold for 262 rupees, equivalent to 199.91 yuan per picul in the local market.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Factory Prices Firm, Fine Yarn Fabrics Rise Sharply by 1-2 Yuan</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market started flat and continued to rise, with selling prices rising steadily. This was because factory prices were very firm, and traders' sentiment changed rapidly, causing the prices of customer cloth to rise by about one yuan per piece. Fine yarn goods were seen as particularly popular, with prices rising by a huge one to two yuan. Transactions for customer sales and hoarding were stimulated again. Over 800 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street, including over 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, twill, and colored cloth by the Guangdong-Hong Kong dealers, over 100 pieces of fine twill and coarse cloth by the Zhejiang-Anhui dealers, and several hundred pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and printed goods by the Jiangsu dealers. On the 17th, 1,230 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Selling prices fluctuated briefly and then rose sharply. As a result, Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 8.5 jiao, medium fine cloth rose by 7.5 jiao, twill rose by 5 jiao, and drill rose by 4 to 6.75 fen per yard. Old orders and old taxes opened at 1.88 yuan and closed at 1.915 yuan. Futures cloth for Dragon Head on the exchange rose by 1.2 to 3 yuan for each month.</p>
<p>Feather Yarn and Satin Also Rise</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter goods, are still continuing to rise in price. The main reason is that the arrival of foreign goods is becoming increasingly difficult, and the output of factory goods is gradually lacking. Both domestic and foreign hoarders are eager. Silk-like feather yarn and electric satin used for lining Western suits have also recently increased in price due to factory payments and cost relationships. Yesterday, the top-grade Yuanchang camel grey assorted electric satin rose to 3.8 yuan per yard, the second grade was 3 yuan, wax money silk-like feather yarn was 2.8 yuan, and wax yarn sold for 2.23 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market continued to be tight, with prices rising from one yuan to 4.5 yuan. Company futures for 24 coarse white sugar for delivery on August 20 were 116.6 yuan, 115.7 yuan, and 116.7 yuan, up one yuan. Futures for the end of August were 117.5 yuan, 118.4 yuan, and 118.6 yuan, up 1.4 yuan. The association's quote for spot 24 coarse white sugar was particularly firm. August arrivals were 118 yuan, 118.5 yuan, and 119.5 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. July arrivals were 117.5 yuan, 118 yuan, 119 yuan, and 119.4 yuan, up 2.4 yuan. June arrivals were 117 yuan, 117.5 yuan, and 118.8 yuan, up 2.3 yuan. April arrivals were 114.7 yuan, later jumping to 118 yuan. Dutch red sugar was also tight. KD mark was 110 yuan to 111 yuan, up 2 yuan. NT mark was 106.5 yuan to 108 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white, B mark was 145 yuan to 148 yuan, up 4 yuan. HX mark was 119 yuan, 119.5 yuan, 120.5 yuan, and 122 yuan, up 3.5 yuan. Road goods were 124 yuan. H mark refined red sugar was 101.5 yuan to 102 yuan, up 2 yuan. Road goods were 103 yuan. CC mark refined ice sugar was 135 yuan. Local factory No. 1 ice sugar was 148 yuan. Jingming ice sugar was 150 yuan, up 5 yuan. Futures turnover was over 21,000 bags, and spot turnover was over 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Resold to Southeast Asia, Market Prices Difficult to Control</p>
<p>The recent rise in cigarette prices has been like a horse off the leash, with buying prices setting unprecedented records. This is because the exchange rate is tight, factories are restricting shipments, and due to hoarding, spot goods are inherently scarce. Furthermore, factories are shipping large quantities to Singapore, resulting in delayed shipments in Shanghai. Demand from all parties is very strong, and sales are rare, so the market is advancing madly. Yesterday, the market opening price for Great Britain brand was as high as 2,030 yuan per case, Old Knife brand was 1,690 yuan, Five Flowers brand was 1,160 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 1,330 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 1,470 yuan, 50-pack Big Front Door was 600 yuan per 10,000, Big Beautiful brand medium case was 1,050 yuan, and Golden Rat brand medium case was 730 yuan, all up 250 to 200 yuan from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hardware: Pig Iron Sales Brisk</p>
<p>Pig iron is what southerners call black iron sheet, which is three feet wide and six feet long, also known as 3x6 feet black iron sheet. The number of sheets ranges from three to thirteen, and there are also eighteen sheets (thin goods). Recently, sales have been brisk due to purchases by local water bottle factories, printing factories, and machinery factories. Although sales to out-of-town dealers are difficult to sustain, local factory sales are not sluggish, so the market atmosphere has not been dull. Transactions are still quite lively, leading holders to be very confident, and standard market prices are unusually firm. Yesterday, various grades such as Nos. 5, 6, and 7 were quoted at over 310 yuan per picul, an increase of about 20 yuan from the previous market.</p>

<h3>Significant Meaning of the Anglo-American Declaration, Shanghai Residents Gain a Deep Understanding, Far East Policy Will Be More Determined, Japanese Newspapers Also Acknowledge the Extreme Seriousness of the Situation</h3>
<p>After the talks between US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill concluded, a joint declaration was issued on the afternoon of the 14th, listing eight principles, declaring that the two countries had no aggressive ambitions, opposed changing the status quo, wished for the restoration of sovereignty and government to invaded countries, adhered to the principles of equal prosperity and free trade, and resolved to reduce armaments and establish lasting peace after the elimination of Nazi tyranny. The eighth item stated that the two countries would disarm the aggressor nations before ending the war. After this news spread around the world, all righteous people expressed excitement and welcomed it as a boon for China, believing that the time for Britain and the United States to use force to sanction Japan was not far off, and that the foundation for China's victory had been laid. Yesterday, all Western newspapers in Shanghai published articles commenting on the joint declaration, all sharing this view, and unanimously believing that the United States had almost declared war on the Axis countries, and that the two countries' policy towards Japan would be more determined in the future, preventing Japan from echoing the Nazis and continuing its adventurous actions. Even the editorials in the two Japanese newspapers in Shanghai openly acknowledged this. The main points of the newspapers' comments are extracted and translated below.</p>
<p>US Action No Different from Declaring War: Mainland Press Comments The Shanghai 大陸報 newspaper commented: The meeting between the two great powers of Britain and the United States clearly shows the world that there is no basis for compromise between aggressors and those who have been invaded. These eight principles are the common goals of Britain and the United States. To achieve these goals, those who fight for freedom must overcome all difficulties and destroy the aggressors' conspiracy to dominate the world. This action by the United States is no different from declaring war on the aggressors and only awaits the right time to act. Although the Axis powers regard the joint declaration as a "threatening propaganda," could this important meeting be a mere show? Although there have been disputes over Wilson's Fourteen Points, believing that it did not guarantee a fair peace nor prevent the outbreak of another war, the current eight principles are concise and to the point, and can avoid further disputes. The impact of this important meeting on the Far East has been greatly concerned by Washington and London. In the future, the two countries' policy towards Japan will be more determined. The grand strategy decided at this meeting will eliminate the value of Japan's assistance to Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Future Actions Depend on Facts: The English-language Shanghai Evening Post commented: The German people and government now believe that an armistice is impossible. Since the minds of the people in the Axis countries have always been manipulated by their governments, and the people controlling the government have already decided to continue fighting, the joint declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill was not intended to alienate the people of the Axis countries from their governments. Therefore, the declaration must have other reasons and practical plans, such as how the United States will transport supplies to Britain, and how it will deal with places like Dakar and Azov. What future actions will Britain and the United States take in the Far East? What steps and sanctions should be taken against further Japanese aggression? All will often be answered with facts. People around the world may receive quick and full answers. If so, the meeting of the two great powers of the Atlantic will have a more satisfactory result than the meeting of the two great powers of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass.</p>
<p>Laying the Foundation for Lasting Peace: The Shanghai 字林西報 North-China Daily News commented: The meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill will undoubtedly become the most significant event in the history of the war. The eight principles announced, one of which is the war's purpose, is to destroy Nazi tyranny. The other seven points of peace are to clarify the principles of democratic countries' fight against aggression. Although these eight principles are slightly similar to Wilson's Fourteen Points, they have an even greater importance, that is, after this war can be ended on terms acceptable to democratic countries, all small and weak nations in the world will regain their freedom. Therefore, according to the peace plan drafted by Roosevelt and Churchill, the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles will not be repeated. Therefore, it has been decided to completely disarm the German people, who are not yet politically mature, so as to reduce the burden of armaments for peace-loving nations. Now that Britain and the United States have made this decision, they will encourage all kinds of people around the world to achieve freedom, stability, and improvement, and lay a permanent foundation for peace. Although achieving this goal is quite difficult, it must be achieved before it can be ended.</p>
<p>Future Resolve Against Japan: The Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun commented on Britain: Although the US-British joint declaration appears moderate when viewed abstractly, its purpose is to try to win over various countries and include them in their own camp to encircle Germany. This shows that Britain and the United States have adopted a positive attitude towards this war. Although there is talk of equal opportunities for trade or economy with Japan, this statement can only be interpreted as expressing dissatisfaction with the occupied areas of China. Other than that, nothing else has been mentioned, which shows that Britain and the United States clearly intend to adopt a policy of defeating the Axis powers one by one. Since the outbreak of the European war, their goal has been to defeat Germany, so they still seem to be pursuing a policy of appeasement towards Japan. However, on the other hand, they are promoting the ABCD line, and the US naval authorities have declared that they do not hesitate to fight on two oceans. Britain has also sent warships to the Pacific and is preparing for war against Japan. Although they still seem to be adopting a policy of appeasement towards Japan on the surface, since the heads of both military forces are attending this meeting, it is difficult to guarantee that there is no considerable conspiracy against Japan. Therefore, although this declaration can be said to be the Monroe Doctrine of the Western Hemisphere, in an emergency, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not make a decision to use force, regardless of whether it is in the Eastern or Western Hemisphere. Therefore, how Britain and the United States will act in the future is something that we should also be deeply concerned about.</p>
<p>Almost Certainly Fighting in Two Oceans: The Japanese-language Mainland News Evaluation stated: Regarding the war's purpose, the Anglo-American joint declaration's content is completely limited to Wilson's old system, which is now reaffirmed. It does not have any new ideals or intentions for rebuilding the world. It only wants to maintain the status quo as firmly as possible. President Roosevelt's purpose is to prevent Britain and Germany from concluding a separate peace. Churchill is deeply afraid that Germany will concentrate its forces to attack Britain, so he wants to use this to tie up the United States so that it can help Britain fight. After the joint declaration was issued, it can be said that both sides' intentions have been satisfied. Since they are in complete agreement, the United States will eventually participate in the war. It is only a matter of time. Since Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a military agreement, stipulating that the two sides would never conclude a separate peace with Germany, and now Britain and the United States have issued a joint declaration, it can be asserted that Britain will never conclude a peace with Germany. It will definitely unite with the Soviet Union to deal with Germany. Therefore, in order to achieve its desire to dominate the world, the United States will drive Britain and the Soviet Union to be its outposts and will actively assist Britain. At the same time, it will provide military assistance to the Soviet Union and will use British and American military bases in the Far East when necessary. As for this declaration, it is, of course, a silent encirclement of Japan in the Far East. Since the United States has decided to participate in the war, it will not be different in its attitude towards the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the future, strategically, it may adopt a positive offensive in the Atlantic Ocean and a negative offensive in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Business Tax, Levied at Two Levels by the Municipal Council, Original Plan Drafted by the New Tax Source Committee, To Be Discussed at Tomorrow's Finance Meeting</h3>
<p>The Japanese-language Mainland News reported that the Municipal Council's Finance Committee had scheduled a meeting for 4:30 PM on the 18th at the Municipal Council meeting hall to discuss the first-ever levy of business tax in the Public Concession. According to the Public Concession constitution, the Yangjingbang Land Charter, there were strict provisions regarding the scope of the Municipal Council's levies, licensing fees, and also regulations regarding the amount of tax levied. Recently, the Public Concession's administrative organs have expanded and various expenditures have increased, so the Municipal Council feels that its income is insufficient every year. This</p>
<p>Business Tax Plan was drafted by the New Tax Source Committee. The French Concession authorities, in order to make up for financial losses, also levied business tax at the beginning of this year, which was divided into A and B levels. Those belonging to level A were theaters, movie theaters, shops, warehouses, factories, etc., with a standard of 2,400 yuan based on the assessed value of the house, and the business tax was levied at 8%. When it exceeded 2,400 yuan, the excess amount was levied at 6%. Those belonging to level B were the offices of various banks and companies, the offices of various exchanges, law offices, insurance companies, hospitals, and other general freelancers, also with a standard of</p>
<p>1,400 yuan based on the assessed value of the house, and the business tax was levied at 12%. When it exceeded this amount, the excess amount was levied at 10%. Therefore, the future Public Concession business tax will be roughly classified into A and B levels in the same way as the French Concession, but it will be based on an assessed value of 3,000 yuan, and the tax rate will be 10% for level A, and 8% for the excess amount, and 15% for level B, and 12% for the excess amount. Therefore, after the implementation of this business tax, the Municipal Council can increase tax revenue by 7 million yuan per year. However, there are different opinions on various issues such as what standards to use to levy taxes on those with small capital. Therefore, it is expected that there will be some difficulties in the comprehensive reform of the tax rate system. All parties are extremely concerned about this matter.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing in Hong Kong, Forms Sanmin Company</p>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing traveled from Chongqing to various places for inspection and returned to Hong Kong, he raised huge amounts of capital and began to organize an enterprise organization called Sanmin Company to handle development and transportation businesses. Wang Xiaolai was also invited to serve as manager, and Wei Bozhen, Wu Zhihao, Jiang Weiyun, etc. assisted in the process. The scale is grand and far-reaching. Mr. Yu goes to the company to work every day, in high spirits, and is extremely optimistic about the future of the nation.</p>
<h3>Stabilization Fund Adopts Positive Measures, Stabilizing the Shanghai Exchange Market, Currently Investigating and Studying the Situation in Various Regions, British Representatives to Assist Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Minister Yi Wei and Wang Shijie announced to reporters in Chongqing on the 11th that the government is determined to stabilize the exchange market and will continue to supply the foreign exchange needed by Chinese and foreign merchants for legal trade. They also authorized the Stabilization Fund Committee to handle matters related to freezing. Since the issuance of the freezing order, the exchange market has seen import and export merchants scrambling to close deals, speculators competing to buy, and Japanese banks secretly covering short positions, causing the exchange rates for British and American currencies to plummet. The government urgently hopes that the Stabilization Fund can take positive and appropriate measures to stabilize the exchange market and consolidate the position of the legal tender.</p>
<p>On-the-Spot Investigation to Determine Measures</p>
<p>It is now known that the British and American members of the Stabilization Fund Committee have been extremely cautious since receiving the order and are making various plans. They have sent representatives to Chongqing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the foreign exchange situation and conduct a thorough study. Dr. Taylor, assistant to American member Fox, has come to Shanghai and is responsible for this mission. At the same time, Fox is currently consulting with the subcommittee on various countermeasures to stabilize the exchange market.</p>
<p>British Experts Will Also Arrive in Shanghai: According to yesterday's Times, the British side has also decided to send Sir Niemeyer, director of the Bank of England, to Shanghai to assist in the stabilization work. Niemeyer is a member of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations and is currently on his way to Shanghai. In the past few years, Niemeyer has been sent by the British government to the United States, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, India, and other countries as an economic representative. It is expected that Niemeyer's arrival will not only do his best to help stabilize the legal tender but also be responsible for establishing the future British economic policy in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>American Missionary Murdered in Huai'an, American Consulate Receives Report</h3>
<p>Female Missionary Wells Tragically Strangled, Several American Missionaries Missing in Qingjiangpu</p>
<p>The previous day, the English-language "China Press" reported that an American female missionary was strangled to death in Huai'an, and that four American missionaries were detained in Qingjiangpu. This news was translated and published in yesterday's newspaper. According to yesterday's "Continental News," the missionary was Ms. Wells. She was tragically strangled when the Japanese authorities seized the American Church Hospital and detained American personnel.</p>
<p>Retaliation Against the U.S. Freezing Measures This news was reported by Chinese people from Qingjiangpu to the American Presbyterian Church personnel in Shanghai. It stated that the Japanese took this action on July 31st to retaliate against the U.S. freezing Japanese assets. At that time, 40 Japanese military police entered the American Church Hospital, forcibly confined all foreigners in the hospital to one house. It is said that the American Consulate has received the report and inquired with the Japanese Consulate and military authorities. The Japanese side stated that they are still investigating and have no results yet. At the same time, Chinese people also reported that the Japanese army planned to close the hospital and expel the patients, but these rumors have not been confirmed. The American missionaries involved in this incident are Mr. and Mrs. Daleport, Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, Mr. and Mrs. Vincent, Ms. Hall, and Ms. McCowan.</p>
<p>Many Missionaries Missing The "North-China Daily News" also reported that according to a group of missionaries who recently arrived in Shanghai, six to eight male and female missionaries and 250 patients from the American Church Hospital in Qingjiangpu have been expelled by the Japanese military police and their whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday, during a press conference hosted by the Japanese side, the Shanghai Japanese Army spokesman, Colonel Akiyama, was asked about this matter. Akiyama admitted that he had heard from "private sources" that "some unfortunate incident" had occurred, but stated that he had no definite information. Because the reported location of the incident is far from Shanghai, he may not receive news about it for some time. The Japanese authorities are currently doing their best to investigate the details.</p>
<p>2 Million Yuan Post Office Robbery Case, General Bureau Telegraphed Reply to Close the Case</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's 2 million yuan remittance robbery case has been solved, and the stolen funds have been recovered, minimizing the loss. The entire process of the incident and the case being solved has been reported to the General Bureau by Mr. Jape Lin, the Shanghai Postal Director and Director of the Shanghai Office of the National Postal General Bureau. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the General Bureau is satisfied with the swift resolution of the case, so it will not investigate further. Post-incident matters have been ordered to be handled carefully by Postal Director Jape to conclude the case. It is now known that three old clerks and two bodyguards from the Savings and Remittance Bureau are still being held at the former Yong'an Silver Company site in Hongkou by the Japanese Military Police and are refusing to allow the Post Office to send personnel to visit them.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, Survey of University and Middle School Students Completed, Preliminary Review Work in Progress, Names Will Be Announced Sequentially Due to the Large Number of Applicants</h3>
<p>The primary school portion of this newspaper's readers' scholarship fund, after being reviewed early and announced in this newspaper on the 15th, has seen applicants eagerly coming to collect the funds in the past two days. Our colleagues at this newspaper have repeatedly instructed them to study hard so as not to betray the enthusiasm of all sectors of society in donating funds to support education. If their grades are excellent, they can continue to apply in the next term. Those who have not yet received the funds are requested to bring their seals and come to this newspaper with the applicant to collect the funds. As for the university and middle school portions, the survey and interview work has been completed. The preliminary review has been conducted in recent days, and it is scheduled to convene a committee meeting on the 19th to review and announce the results. Due to the large number of applicants, the results may be announced continuously over several days. Furthermore, applicants are anxious about the lack of tuition fees as the start of the school term approaches, and they have been sending letters asking whether their scholarship applications have been approved. This point cannot be answered before the public announcement. However, readers of this newspaper and colleagues at this newspaper who have enthusiastically donated funds will definitely not disappoint the applicant students with excellent grades and poor family backgrounds.</p>
<p>Movie Star Zhou Xuan Sympathizes with and Supports Education Ms. Zhou Xuan, a star of the Guohua Film Company, is dedicated to the film industry. She was deeply moved by Ms. Li Qinain's donation of a large sum of money. Yesterday, she also donated 100 yuan, demonstrating her courage to do good. The Jincheng and Jindu theaters also each contributed 100 yuan, and the Liangyou Photography and Printing Company also used its savings to contribute to the education fund. We would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the poor students. The list of donors to the education fund is as follows: Ms. Zhou Xuan, 100 yuan; Jincheng Theater, 100 yuan; Jindu Theater, 100 yuan; Mr. Wu Bingjing, 40 yuan; Little Sister Fan Yunfang, 40 yuan; all employees of Liangyou Photography and Printing Company, 33 yuan; Ms. Wu Yunwei, 20 yuan; Guitar, 20 yuan; Anonymous, 13 yuan and 1 jiao 6 fen; Dao Guang, 13 yuan; Yan Ji, 10 yuan; Mr. Gong Minghuo, 10 yuan; also, three primary school students saved their movie ticket money to donate, totaling: Zheng Mingcheng, 5 yuan; Zhu Daming, 2 yuan; Gu Xili, 2 yuan (totaling 9 yuan); Zhou Yuezhen, 1 yuan. The above totals 509 yuan and 1 jiao 6 fen. Previously, 51,110 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen were saved, bringing the total to 51,619 yuan and 4 jiao 1 fen. (The 50 yuan donated by Zhang Xuren, the owner of Wenxinjv, Bu Buzu Zhai, Mr. Xu Naichi, and Mr. Zhang Dezhao, which was published in yesterday's donation list, is actually Mr. Lu Shenbao's birthday gift of 50 yuan, but the total was wrong, so this is clarified.)</p>
<p>Coal Briquettes, Price Controls Lifted</p>
<p>After checking the evidence submitted by various coal briquette factories, the French Concession authorities decided to lift the price controls on coal briquettes stipulated on August 9th of this year. However, in order to maintain market prices, they are studying methods to ensure that residents can purchase this daily necessity at a reasonable price. However, after hearing the news yesterday, residents throughout the city were quite uneasy, believing that the burden of living would inevitably become heavier. They earnestly hope that the authorities will withdraw the decision to abolish the coal briquette price assessment and continue to assess the coal briquette factory stock and the standard sales price for door-to-door sales. Otherwise, they will allow coal dealers to raise prices, which will not only make it impossible for ordinary people to live, but also make social order a major concern.</p>
<h3>Coolidge, Safe Voyage</h3>
<p>No SOS Signal Sent</p>
<p>The President Coolidge of the American President Lines, which arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month from Manila and Hong Kong and has been anchored in the Huangpu River overnight, set sail for the U.S. on the morning of the 15th. The night before, news suddenly came from Manila that the ship had sent out a distress signal when it reached certain Japanese waters. When asked about this matter, a garbage collector from the American President Lines in Shanghai stated that the company had not received any distress messages regarding the ship. It is said that this news is absolutely false. The company is in constant communication with the Coolidge and there is no misfortune.</p>
<p>French Authorities Pay Attention to Price Trends</p>
<p>Since the land tax, house tax, and water fees, as well as the streetcar and public bus fares, have been increased one after another, prices have risen accordingly. In order to stabilize prices within the concession, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Municipal Council has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM tomorrow to discuss the prices of general goods within the concession. The most important items are rice, coal, oil, and fresh fish. However, regarding the price of rice, the committee assessed the price of No. 1 Saigon rice at 126 yuan per stone last week, but yesterday No. 1 Saigon rice was sold on the market for more than 130 yuan, a difference of more than 10 yuan. Coal briquettes were originally 16 yuan per dan, but are now selling for 16 yuan and 6 jiao. Soybean oil has increased to 2 yuan and 2 jiao per jin, and pork has risen to 4 yuan per jin. Although not uniform, such unrestrained price increases are enough to hinder the security of the concession, making it urgently necessary to properly plan a method to stop them. Currently, the French authorities have announced the abolition of coal briquette price controls, and soybean oil has also exceeded the price limit by more than 3 jiao per jin.</p>
<p>Is it Against the U.S. Oil Transport?</p>
<p>No Definite Indication of Interception According to the "North-China Daily News," the Japanese military spokesman stated at yesterday's (15th) press conference that the Japanese side is "quite concerned about the arrival of 90,000 barrels of oil being transported to Vladivostok on an American oil tanker." However, the spokesman refused to say whether the Japanese side would intercept the oil, only stating that the matter would depend on whether the goods could be classified as "war supplies" and that it would have to be decided by Tokyo. The local Japanese authorities have not received any notification about the steps the Japanese government will take regarding the oil being transported and general supplies in the future. However, he believes that no one can assert that the supplies being delivered to the Soviet Union will not be diverted south to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>The Confession of a Student Who Lost the Opportunity to Study: Another "Unrighteous Father"</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the seriousness of the procedures for applying for scholarships, our colleagues have been diligently and enthusiastically engaged in investigating the family circumstances of various students. What our colleagues are being careful about is that we do not want to disappoint any student in urgent need of assistance, and at the same time, we do not want to waste a single penny of the money generously donated by readers who are enthusiastic about helping students.</p>
<p>The "Unsympathetic Brother" and "Unrighteous Father" mentioned in this newspaper's face-to-face interview records on the 11th have both received letters from readers. The letters sympathizing with the "Unsympathetic Brother" will not take up more space. Another reader, Mr. Mu, wrote a letter in which he advocated that the younger brother should embark on a productive path, or work-study. We are very moved and admire Mr. Mu's opinion. We believe that if an older brother has a monthly income of several hundred yuan, if he is sincerely loving to his younger brother, it seems that he should not be so poor that he cannot afford his younger brother's tuition fees of 60 or 70 yuan per semester. We understand the kindness of readers in donating money to support education. We definitely do not want the education of a younger brother with good grades and character to be interrupted halfway, so we must find a way to help him. At the same time, we also hope that parents and older brothers who are generally responsible for educating their children can be as responsible as possible, because there are many more lonely and helpless students in urgent need of assistance! We feel that it is right to prioritize what is urgent and then what is less urgent. We should sincerely hope and frankly request the parents and older brothers who are not absolutely unable to pay tuition fees. The "Unrighteous Father" section also received several letters from readers who mistakenly praised it. Among them, the letter from a woman who signed herself as a student who lost the opportunity to study was the most sympathetic and sincere. She and her sister are struggling in society, using their income to support their kind mother. Their father also abandoned his wife and made his two weak daughters lose the opportunity to study because of another love. We are very sympathetic to this fact after reading the woman's letter; however, simply blaming their father will not benefit the event itself. This kind of situation is a moral problem, a love problem, and a social problem. To reduce such unfortunate events, it is necessary for men and women to form a marriage seriously. After marriage, they must be based on mutual love, mutual assistance, and mutual understanding to form a complete family. We feel that the reality proves that such middle-of-the-road love, abandoning daughters and wives, is inhuman, destructive to the family, harmful to good customs, and weakens social health, and will be condemned by personal conscience and severely judged by morality, except for the fact that it is not allowed by law. Einstein said in his autobiography that people accept the inherent virtues in society as naturally as they accept air. We publish this woman's letter in the hope that people who are on or wandering on this thorny path will be vigilant! Realize! Repent! Stop immediately, turn around, accept the inherent virtues, and breathe the natural air.</p>
<p>The following is the original letter from the student who lost the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am not a person applying for a scholarship, but I sympathize with a person applying for a scholarship. When I saw the family situation of a female scholarship applicant published on page 7 of your newspaper on the 11th, I couldn't help but be reminded of my old wounds and burst into tears! Ten years ago, my father was doing business in Shanghai. Although life was not top-notch, it was still an upper-middle-class family. A loving father and mother, who wouldn't envy these four big "real" girls. Good times don't last, "I only see the new people smile, but I don't see the old people cry." These two sentences actually occurred in this happy family.</p>
<p>This is a story of repaying kindness with revenge: My father's lover, who is also the protagonist of repaying kindness with revenge, is the daughter of my mother's friend. Because she was poor, she asked my mother for help, asking her to introduce her to a job. My mother was a kind and weak person, so she immediately made her my family's teacher. This just fell into the other person's trick, so the transformation of the family and the tragedy began.</p>
<p>At first, my father paid the living expenses on time. If he was a little unhappy, he would vent his anger on us, scolding us lightly and punishing us severely, without any love for his own flesh and blood. At that time, I was only ten years old, and my sister was only eight years old, and I had already tasted the pain of losing the opportunity to study. After the January 28th Incident, although I was given the opportunity to study for a year, it was "ten cold and one warm," which not only did not improve, but also increased the pain of awareness.</p>
<p>(Fortunately, there were onlookers who were indignant and pitied our situation, and helped my sister and me to go to school, but due to the changes in the situation, we only completed a primary school golden period, and that was how it passed.) My mother became a useless person who had food but no work. Because my father's economy was sufficient, his temperament also changed with his wealth. He had forgotten what a husband and wife are, what flesh and blood are, and what the five human relationships are. He began to scold my mother, and even when my eldest sister got married, he didn't give a penny, didn't ask, and enjoyed the peace, My mother was a person who was influenced by the old ethics, so she could only endure and seek survival, thinking that human nature would not die for long, and there would be a day of reflection, but who knew that all the endurance could not make the ungrateful person feel ashamed and reflect!</p>
<p>Before the August 13th Incident, the whole family returned to Guangdong. At that time, my father had already had the heart to abandon us. He had tried to escape once but failed. Until one day last year, he actually performed a live drama of expelling his wife and abandoning his children. At that time, my mother had no choice but to ask for litigation, but my father relied on his money and power to avoid seeing her; the inquiries published in the newspaper were unanswered, and now we are separated invisibly. My sisters have worked hard to take on the heavy responsibilities of the family to comfort our mother, who has suffered so much. I am a person who was abandoned by my father and has suffered the pain of being stimulated by this family and losing the opportunity to study, so I deeply sympathize with this scholarship applicant. Because I believe that a person who has suffered pain and stimulation will definitely cherish herself, work hard to improve, and develop her new life. Finally, I hope that if this woman gets the opportunity, she will work hard to move forward in the future and develop for society to comfort her abandoned mother, and don't be influenced by heredity to be an irresponsible person.</p>
<p>With the most sincere and frank attitude, I say a word. I know that you are a person who is enthusiastic about society. I hope to borrow your great pen (because my pen is really too clumsy) to remind some people who only know about lust and forget about their wives and children not to only know how to enjoy themselves and ignore the suffering of others, forget their responsibilities, and bury the great youth of the country. Because I don't know how many people are suffering from this pain!</p>
<p>The writing is not fluent, and the words are not smooth. I have spent your precious time. I am sorry and happy. I hope you will forgive me. With An, Sincerely, A Student Who Lost the Opportunity to Study, August 12th</p>

<h3>Zheng Zuyin, Manager of Hancheng Foreign Firm, Kidnapped Yesterday, Four Kidnappers Ambushed at the Alley Entrance, Forcibly Taken into a Car and Kidnapped Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Hancheng Foreign Firm at 115 Yuanyuan Road, Public Concession, was opened by Zheng Zhonghan from Zhenhai. After Zheng passed away two years ago, he left behind nine sons and five daughters. The eldest son, Zheng Zuyin, succeeded as the manager. Zheng is currently 26 years old and studied at Fudan University. This spring, he married his fellow villager, Huang Aiying, and lived with her at 11 Fulu Village, Lane 384, Fulvli Road, French Concession. After his father passed away due to illness in 1939, Zuyin immediately left school to succeed his father, equipped with car number 6125, acting as his own driver, leaving early and returning late, which had become a habit. Yesterday morning, around 9:00, Zuyin, as usual, had breakfast, wearing a light gray suit, and went out with his wife and younger brother Zuxiang (a student at the attached middle school of Fudan University). They boarded the car, but as soon as the car drove out of the alley entrance, four bandits suddenly jumped out of the roadside, three wearing Western suits and one wearing short shirt and pants. Two bandits drew out pistols, intercepted Zheng's car, and threatened them. They first expelled Zheng Zuyin's wife and brother from the car and sent someone to monitor them. Then Zuyin was dragged out of the car and helped into a black-plated car number 8794 parked by the roadside. A bandit driver sped off towards Terrace Road. Afterwards, Zheng's brother Zuxiang reported the situation to the French police station and requested an investigation. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate the scene. They are currently ordering the tracking of the bandits.</p>

When Wang's rickshaw puller, Qu Hanbang, saw his master being shot, he cried out in shock. The shooter did not dare to stay long and fled with his gun without a trace. Afterwards, Wang hurriedly ordered Qu to drive to Shizelong Hospital for treatment, so the police station did not receive a report at the time. Later, the hospital reported the incident and is currently investigating the case. It is said that Wang's injuries are not serious.</p>

<h3>Contentment and Patience</h3>
<p>— Hu Ying</p>
<p>"Contentment brings constant joy, and patience brings peace." This is a very standard couplet for doorways, and we can see it on people's doors. The meaning of this saying is that as long as a person can be content and patient, they can enjoy a happy and comfortable life.</p>
<p>I often see some people whose families are already well-off, but because they are not content and admire the extravagant and romantic life, they use all their property for speculation, hoping for a lucky success. However, the reality is often the opposite of the ideal. Not only do they fail to achieve their goals, but they also end up ruined and disgraced, regretting it too late! Isn't this the harm of not being content? There are also some people who are hot-tempered, and when they encounter something unsatisfactory, they slam the table and roar like thunder! They have no patience at all, and this is of course also a failure. As the old saying goes, "A little impatience spoils great plans." Such a fiery temper will certainly affect their future!</p>
<p>At present, how expensive are prices? It is not easy for a father to maintain the household expenses. We should be content with clothing, food, etc., and only seek to be warm and full. However, we cannot be content in seeking knowledge. We should make progress inch by inch and have endless desires in order to achieve success. We must not be complacent with a little gain and think that our knowledge is already vast. We must know that knowledge is a bottomless ocean, and what you have learned is just a drop in the bucket!</p>
<p>One more thing we should remember is that patience has limits! If someone punches you or kicks you, you may as well be patient for a while and not argue with them. If someone wants to ruin your reputation, you should use all your strength, embrace the spirit of fearlessness, and stand up and fight them until you win! This is true for individuals, and of course, it is also true for countries!</p>
<p>In short, contentment and patience are both inherent virtues of our country. Except for the pursuit of learning and in cases of extreme necessity, we should adhere to them unswervingly.</p>
<h3>"Driving in Reverse" and "Jumping the Ditch"</h3>
<p>— Shang Heng</p>
<p>What does the phrase "driving in reverse" mean? I think children all know it. A car that does not move forward but backward; this is called "driving in reverse." For example, a student who was in the fourth grade of elementary school last year has regressed to the third grade this year; next year he still wants to regress to the second grade; we would say that this student is "driving in reverse."</p>
<p>"Jumping the ditch," then, how do you explain that? A person riding a horse, seeing a ditch across in front of him, disregards everything and spurs the horse to jump over; this is called "jumping the ditch." For example, a student who was in the third grade of elementary school last year suddenly jumps to the first grade of upper elementary school this year; next year he still wants to take the junior high school exam, we would say that this student is "jumping the ditch."</p>
<p>"Driving in reverse" is regression, and we should strongly oppose it. I believe that a person or student who is "driving in reverse" will definitely fail and be eliminated in society in the future because only those who adapt to the trend of the times have a place to stand in a competitive world?</p>
<p>"Driving in reverse" is certainly regression, but "jumping the ditch" is also very dangerous. One careless step, and you will fall into the ditch.</p>
<p>Children, now there are three paths for you to take. Please use extremely sharp eyes and extremely correct thinking to choose the path you want to take. The three paths are: one is the path of "driving in reverse," one is the path of "jumping the ditch," and the other is the path of "walking on solid ground."</p>
<p>As I see it, the top two paths are not good. The third path is the most stable, which is the path of "walking on solid ground."</p>
<h3>Does the Sea Have a Bottom?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xianjin</p>
<p>One morning, Hai'er and his younger brother Min'er were sitting together by the pond in the courtyard, watching the green water rippling with shallow waves, while chatting.</p>
<p>As they chatted, they suddenly talked about the question of the sea. Min'er said with certainty, "Brother! I believe the sea definitely has no bottom." The brother corrected, "No, the sea has a bottom." Min'er disagreed again, "Brother, if you don't believe it, we can go to the seaside right now to explore it." The brother explained, "Min'er, when we go to the beach to explore, because the water is too deep and very dirty, we can't see the bottom of the sea." Min'er still disagreed, "No, my textbook also tells me that the sea has no bottom."</p>
<p>The two argued with each other, neither willing to give up. As a result, Hai'er came up with a good idea.</p>
<p>Hai'er said, "It's no use arguing like this. Why don't we ask Dad?" Min'er listened and confidently followed his brother to ask their father.</p>
<p>They found their father, and Min'er asked first, "Dad, does the sea have a bottom?" Hai'er was about to argue, but Dad had already spoken. Dad said fairly, "Min'er, the sea does have a bottom. This has been proven by many scientists. For example, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean is 45,000 feet deep." Min'er listened to this and had to go back to the courtyard to play, his face red with embarrassment.</p>
<h3>Interesting Egg Problem</h3>
<p>— Wang Ya Xian</p>
<p>This day, it was raining, and playful Min'er couldn't go outside to play, and he was feeling bored at home. His brother Cong'er said to him, "I have an interesting problem, can you answer it?" Min'er said, "Okay, tell me, what kind of problem is it?"</p>
<p>Cong'er said, "An egg seller took eggs to the market to sell. His first customer bought half of all his eggs, plus half an egg! His second customer also bought half of the remaining eggs, plus half an egg. His third customer bought half of the remaining eggs in the same way, plus half an egg. In this way, his eggs were just sold out, but he didn't break a single egg. Think about it, how many eggs did he have in total?" Min'er found the problem very interesting, but after thinking for a while, he couldn't figure it out. He went to ask his brother how many eggs the person had in total. His brother Cong'er said, "That person had a total of seven eggs. The first person bought half of them, which is three and a half, plus another half an egg, isn't that four eggs in total? Then he had three eggs left. The second person bought half of the remaining eggs, which is one and a half, plus another half an egg, which is two eggs in total. Then there was only one egg left. The third person bought half of the remaining egg, which is half an egg, plus half an egg, isn't that exactly one egg for him to buy? In this way, the egg seller sold all his eggs without breaking a single egg." Min'er listened to his brother's explanation and suddenly understood, nodding repeatedly. At this time, the sky had cleared, and he ran outside to ask his friends about this interesting egg problem. (Reward for assisting the scholarship)</p>
<h3>Harming Others Harms Oneself</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a rat living on land who, unfortunately, became close friends with a frog who lived mostly in the water.</p>
<p>One day, the frog had bad intentions and tied the rat's feet tightly to his own feet. The two animals were linked together. The frog first led his rat friend to the meadow where they usually looked for food. After that, he led the rat to the edge of the pond where he lived. Until later, the frog suddenly jumped into the pond, dragging the rat down with him. The frog was very happy in the water, swimming back and forth, croaking as if he had won a great victory.</p>
<p>The unfortunate rat soon drowned in the water. His body was still tied to the frog's feet, floating on the surface of the water. An eagle saw it from the air and suddenly flew down, grabbing him with its claws and taking him into the air.</p>
<p>The frog, because he was still tightly tied to the rat's legs, was also taken away by the eagle and became a snack.</p>
<p>Children! After reading this story, do you think harming others is beneficial?</p>
<h3>Homemade Popsicles</h3>
<p>— Bi Gen</p>
<p>Children! In this hot summer, don't you want to eat some cold drinks to cool down? But what is sold in the market is often not very hygienic. I will tell you a kind of homemade popsicle. The method is very simple and quite interesting:</p>
<p>Prepare: Ice. Calcium chloride (sold in chemical industrial raw material stores, about seven or eight cents a pound, can be used in three times). Fruit syrup or cooked red beans. Several lead-skin popsicle molds, wooden box.</p>
<p>Method: Crush the ice into small pieces, put it in a wooden box, and mix with calcium chloride. Mix the fruit syrup with cold boiled water, put it in the mold, and insert a small stick. Insert it between the ice cubes in the wooden box. At this time, the ice and calcium chloride undergo a chemical reaction, which can lower the temperature in the box to about minus 50 degrees Celsius, and the fruit syrup will condense into a popsicle shape. Take the mold out of the box and soak it in cold water, and the popsicle can be taken out and eaten. If you want to continue, you can make it in the same way. The ice cubes in the box, etc., are still effective. In this way, you can make a lot of popsicles, and the whole family can eat them. And the popsicles made in this way are very hygienic because bacteria cannot survive at minus 50 degrees. Moreover, things you make yourself are more delicious than ready-made ones on the market!</p>
<p>Superstition</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Lagner Elementary School</h3>
<p>— Zhao Demao</p>
<p>Superstition is a bad habit of people, especially in China. Almost one-third of the 365 days of the year are spent worshiping Buddha, gods, and ancestors.</p>
<p>Today, I accidentally flipped through last year's diary and made a statistic, which made me discover a surprising result - I made 33 offerings of food in half a year (that is, worshiping ancestors, averaging almost once a week. If each time costs 20 yuan, then wouldn't it cost 1,000 yuan?</p>
<p>If every household could save this amount of money, then little by little, grain by grain, wouldn't the money saved nationwide be used to protect the country and defend the people? Then I dare say that we would never have to live this painful life here.</p>
<p>However, I see that there are still many small roads where Taiping Gong Jiao (a Taoist ritual) are being held. Not only do they not "contribute money or effort," but they are actually doing things that are both expensive and laborious. This is really a painful and foolish act! Moreover, the Flame Mouth (a Buddhist ritual) is often performed until late at night, and people often catch colds because of this. If they eat this Flame food full of dust and bacteria, then the epidemic will inevitably break out, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and even death.</p>
<p>Children, can you tell me? What kind of peace is this supposed to protect?!</p>
<h3>Asking About Flowers</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>Although it is a small garden the size of a dried tofu, A Liang's father can still plant some flowers and plants. The walls facing west are covered with green morning glories, the wooden fences on the east side are covered with the large green leaves of loofah gourds, and two or three ropes are pulled down from the upstairs to guide the loofah gourds and morning glories to climb up. In addition, there is enough space to plant some low shrubs and more than a dozen pots of herbaceous flowers. In the summer, it is full of greenery and pleasing to the eye. Even in A Liang's mind, it feels quite lovely, so A Liang is often with them, as if he has made very close friends. He also knows a lot about his friends - flowers and trees - everything.</p>
<p>One day, his father was tidying up: removing the weeds from the flower pots, loosening the soil, and lining up the flower pots. Unintentionally, he saw a hole under each flower pot. "This is of course because I'm afraid there is too much water in the flower pot, so there must be a hole to release the excess water, but why can't there be too much water in the flower pot?" He thought to himself, but suddenly he couldn't figure out the reason, so he told his father about it.</p>
<p>"This is indeed difficult to answer. You must know that the roots of the flowers and plants in the flower pot also have life. They also need to breathe, just like us. Therefore, the soil in the flower pot should allow air to enter. If the water in the flower pot stays in the pot because the roots don't have time to absorb it all, and there is too much excess water, then the pot will be completely occupied by water, all the gaps are filled with water, the soil is all water, and there is no room for air to exist. Therefore, the roots of the flowers and plants cannot breathe and are suffocated to death, just like people are suffocated to death by water. Finally, the roots will gradually rot, and the flower or plant will die. So there should be a hole at the bottom of the flower pot to release excess water, and on the one hand, to allow air to come and go freely. The reason we fill the flower pot high is the same."</p>
<p>"Dad, look at these flowers and trees, they are all green leaves, and there are very few flowers. What are so many leaves for?"</p>
<p>"Leaves are the most important thing for flowers and trees. If there are no leaves, there are no flowers and trees. The reason why flowers and trees can bloom and bear fruit is that they need sunlight and the carbon dioxide we exhale, plus the water absorbed by the roots in the soil, to be transported to the leaves. You must know that there is chlorophyll in the leaves. The reason why leaves appear green is all thanks to it. When sunlight shines on the leaves, chlorophyll begins to work, converting the carbon dioxide and water absorbed by the leaves into food for flowers and trees. Therefore, chlorophyll is like a machine, sunlight is the coal burned, carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, and the food made for flowers and trees is their output. Moreover, the food for flowers and trees is also our food. Otherwise, why do I eat vegetables? Because vegetables are full of ready-made food. Flowers and trees eat the food they make themselves to grow, so the more leaves there are, the more food is made, and the faster the flowers and trees grow."</p>
<p>Later, his father picked some flowers for the vase and placed them on the desk, which made the whole room look much better. But by the evening, some of the flowers had withered, and some of the flowers had closed without opening. "What is the reason for this?" A Liang asked his father again.</p>
<p>"This is because the air in the room easily dries out the petals, and the water absorbed by the flower stem in the vase still doesn't have time to moisturize the petals, so the flowers that are picked down wither after being displayed for a short time. The flowers that are closed and not open may bloom again tomorrow, because when it gets to night, the temperature drops, but the flowers need a certain temperature to bloom. When it gets to night, there is of course no sunlight, and the flowers are not willing to bloom either."</p>

<h3>Hollywood "Arsenal"</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Recently, in order to cope with the tense world situation and to prevent the outbreak of war, the United States has spared no effort in expanding its armaments. All institutions, whether run by the state or private individuals, that manufacture military equipment are now requisitioned by the government and are working hard to produce. Since then, it has had little impact on the various classes of society, but the most affected is Hollywood. Before explaining the reason, I would like to ask the reader to close their eyes and recall.</p>
<p>Don't we often see scenes of war on the screen? Guns, cannons, tanks, even airplanes, are they not all equipped, and are they not all realistic? But Hollywood is not an arsenal, so where do these military equipment come from? Originally, they were rented from military equipment manufacturing institutions in the country; now, because the government restricts their supply to private use, wouldn't Hollywood film merchants have great difficulties if they wanted to create war scenes again?</p>
<p>In order to remedy this, the clever film merchants have really prepared to set up an "arsenal" themselves, but the "military equipment" they manufacture can only be said to be imitations. This kind of imitation industry was already very common in Hollywood before the restrictions were imposed, and it is now even more developed. In the past, they could only imitate light military equipment, but now they have progressed to being able to imitate airplanes, and the products of the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation are the most famous and have a very impressive output. Currently, the company is imitating a German Messerschmitt-type aircraft, preparing to use it in a new film: in the near future, we will be able to see aircraft on the screen that are similar to the real thing but not the real thing? Finally, I can tell the reader that the so-called "steel-bone buildings" and "armored ships" in the films are actually made of wood, but after a coat of paint, they can deceive our eyes; the tricks of Hollywood film merchants are really ever-changing!</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Kingdom Chronicles</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xian</p>
<p>(2) Teacher and Student Turn Against Each Other, Head of the Teachings Beaten</p>
<p>Shang Laodao (He Yu), who sings martial arts roles, has a unique masterpiece called "Battle of Chuzhou." This play is about the story of the teacher and student of the Yuan Dynasty Marshal Tuotuo turning against each other. Now, a real news story about a teacher and student turning against each other has happened in the northern pear garden. The protagonists are the Tongtian Sect Master Wang Yaoqing, mentioned above, and his beloved disciple, "Senior Brother Cheng Yuqing," who is very powerful in Gu Xuanxuan. Moreover, Yuqing, after turning against his teacher, even beat his teacher and injured him. Some people may not believe this when it is said, but listen to me slowly:</p>
<p>On the evening of the 31st of last month, Wang's residence at No. 7 Dama Temple was full of distinguished guests (as usual, Yao's family only has a market after dinner, and friends and disciples go to his house in the middle of the night). This "Senior Brother" Cheng Yuqing, the boss, walked into the house swaying from side to side. People in the house knew at a glance that "Senior Brother" had drunk a few more glasses today, because this was a very common thing, so everyone didn't care. Unexpectedly, after Yuqing entered the house, he said to Wang: "Are you going to agree to that matter or not?" At that time, Yaoqing seemed to know that Yuqing was a little drunk, and in order to avoid talking too much, he said to him: "I agree!" Yuqing said again: "It's not enough to just agree, you have to say you definitely agree." After Yuqing finished speaking, Yaoqing's face showed displeasure, and the two sides said more and more outrageous things, one sentence after another. Yuqing then said to himself: "I, his mother, have reason but also no reason, you, his mother, have no reason but also have reason!" When Yaoqing heard Yuqing start scolding, in front of everyone, wouldn't he lose the dignity of a teacher? So he said sternly to Yuqing: "If you say 'his mother' again, I will beat you." (Beating means hitting) Yaoqing's words were intended to intimidate, not to really hit him. Unexpectedly, before the words were out of his mouth, Yuqing immediately punched Wang's face, and spoke as he moved. "You hit me, I hit you!" (The teacher said it as a joke, but the disciple really hit.) Seeing the situation, Yaoqing immediately got up from the opium couch to dodge. Although he didn't touch his face, his left arm had been scratched by Yuqing, and blood was flowing non-stop. At that time, Yaoqing was about to hit Yuqing back, but another disciple of his, Zhang Xiaoshan, a famous ticket holder from the north, actually held his teacher down, although he was persuading him, he did not want Yaoqing to hit Yuqing. At this time, Yang Baozhong (Yaoqing's nephew) and Du Haiquan (Wang Yurong's manager) persuaded Yuqing out. Yuqing scolded as he walked, and continued to roar at the door. Yang and Du embraced Yuqing and took him to Zhang Meiyun's house, another female disciple of Wang's who lived across the street from Wang's house. This new play of teacher and student turning against each other ended here. As for why Yuqing wanted to hit Yaoqing, and what exactly was the matter that Yuqing asked Yaoqing about? Listen to the next episode.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Ming Shou</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Yuan Yuan Small Characters Jiao Luo Qi</p>
<p>Yuan Yuan hurriedly said to the lyricist, "The old man is here again, how annoying! I know he must have bad intentions towards me. Please avoid him for the time being! To avoid meeting each other inconvenient, I have to wrong you," the lyricist said, "I don't have to hide, I'll go home now. After I go back, I'll prepare everything and be sure to prepare a boat to pick you up tomorrow to go together. As for where to go, we'll discuss it in detail tomorrow night." As the lyricist said this, there was already a sound of people downstairs, and he immediately said goodbye to Yuan Yuan and went downstairs. After Xi Yu Lyricist left, Tian Hongyu had already gone upstairs. He only brought two or three attendants today, and Hua Butterfly did not come with him. Yuan Yuan felt a little more at ease, and then cheered up to receive him. Tian Hongyu sent some pearl jewelry and said to her with a smile, "I didn't have anything to give you yesterday, now I only brought some pearls, if you like them, take them. I love you for being exceptionally intelligent. If you like to travel to Yanjing, I'll take you with me, because I'll be returning north soon." Yuan Yuan listened to his words, her heart pounding, and she had to thank him on her face, and said that her body was not very strong now, and the road to Yanjing was long and far away, and she was afraid that her weak body could not bear the burden of the journey, and she would wait for another day, if there was a chance, she would definitely go to serve him. Tian Hongyu laughed and said, "If I pick you up to go together, someone will take care of you along the way, and I will definitely not make you tired, so why do you have to wait for another day? There are twelve golden hairpins in the old man's mansion; women's music is in line, comparable to Niu Sengru in those years, it's a pity that there is still a lack of a female secretary, a fairy genius like you, a talented woman like Sima Xiangru, is really rare! If you are willing to go with the old man, you will definitely be the best in the group, and the old man will not fail you, I don't know what your beauty's heart is like? Do you dislike me for being old?" After saying this, he laughed again. Yuan Yuan listened to Tian Hongyu's words and his laughter, and was very scared in her heart. She thought to herself, I only need to perfunctorily get you through this, and tomorrow night, I and the lyricist will leave quietly, and fly away into the darkness, no matter how much wealth and power you have, you can't do anything to me.
