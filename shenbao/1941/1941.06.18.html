<h3 id="c5">德蘇緊張關係的檢討 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>近頃德蘇關係，又臨緊張微妙的階段，算起來，這回已經是大戰以來的第五决了。追溯往事，若歐戰初起時瓜分波蘭的默契，一九四零年在北歐所引起的敵對危機，今年春初在巴爾幹互相角逐勢力的進退，再加上一月以前，德義「假道」土耳其進攻蘇彝士與中東的要求，突然之中對蘇土的提出。凡上所述，德蘇因猜忌而引起的危機，不絕如縷。當假道土國及瓜分中東盛傳一時之際，全世界人士都受到震驚，而英美方面，則允其表示憂慮；但終於因蘇土立塲堅定，消弭了一個莫大的國際危機，使德義不得不移轉目標，集中力量去閃擊克里特島。可是，侵佔了克里特島之後，德義聯軍反而暫停軍事行動，此際忽以非常成脅姿態，向蘇聯重提要求，引起了當前十分緊張的局面。其中眞相如何，以德蘇兩國之神秘莫測，殆非到最後揭曉的時候，必無法知悉；不過，我們歸納這幾天的各處電訊，却主少可以得到幾點：（一）德國現在重視對蘇關係，超過對央戰爭的行進。（二）蘇聯對所謂「新秩序」的態度，在德義方四，是一個最基本的問題；縱使牠不參加，也必須表示默契或諒解。（三）經濟上，蘇聯更進一步支持德義，使牠們和央美綜合力量進行長期大戰。（四）軍事上，德義仍然企圖由陸上進襲；這一點，就反證出克里特島式閃電戰略的試驗，在德義是一個失敗。</p>
<p>克里特島戰爭發生前，當德義對蘇土提出假道要求的同時、曾突然發生了納粹領袖之一的赫斯飛英事件。那時，情勢非常明顯：對英美，希特勒想利用和蘇聯史進一步合作的舊調，鼓動綏靖論及孤立主義派的抬頭，以鬆懈英美的鬥志與準備；對蘇聯，則仍是利用與英國進行所謂「談判的和平」的手段，壓迫蘇土接受他的一切要求。可是蘇土慫度的堅決，英美對和平攻勢的痛斥，却粉碎了希特勒的迷夢。在目前德義並沒有什麼新奇的和平攻勢，以配合牠們的對蘇交涉，這在聲勢上，比上决己經微弱得多；而歐洲各民主國家，最近又在倫敦發出徹底擊敗希特勒主義的宣言，允其是迎頭堵塞了德義發動任何和平攻勢的可能。德義這一决，祇有被迫用集中大軍於蘇聯邊界的手段，來配合牠們對蘇聯的談判；然而蘇聯却也以更多數量武力的舉行演習，作為有力的答覆。所以，僅就交涉的本身而論，德國這决成功的可能，格外比上决渺茫得多。</p>
<p>再由軍事與戰略上觀察，近兩天來德蘇邊界上的劍拔弩張，與其說是對蘇聯形成一個巌重的威脅，遠不如說德義本身反受了一個重大威脅，來得確切得多。德義日侵略集團，各和勁敵作生死存亡的搏鬥中，絕無力量與勇氣再和蘇聯開戰，是世人所一致公認的。因此，在目前情　下，不管德蘇兩方集中軍力的實際數量如何，事實上，只有蘇聯主動去進攻德義；而德義力面，却祇有竭力避免引起與蘇聯的正面衝突。所以，德軍目前的集中蘇聯邊境，不過是虛聲恫嚇，或者是一種幻想而已。而況在經濟資源及對外通路上，德義日三國的一個致命點，早已握在蘇聯的手裹。萬一牠們和蘇聯發生戰爭，則不管最後勝利到底如何，三個侵略夥伴間，首先就失去了聯繫，一切物資互相調節的可能，立刻就完全失去；而在消除了對於蘇聯競爭的顧忌下，英美當然更可進一步加緊海上封鎖，澈底斷絕三國的海外供給，以加速牠們崩潰。那時，放在牠們面前的，不是最後被軍力擊潰，就是坐待資源耗竭，陷人空前飢荒，而被迫投降。所以綜合起夾看，這一决蘇德交涉，不問德國提出什麼要求，蘇聯總有極大運用的餘地：可以全部加以拒絕，可以部份的，或附有條件的接受，可以修改或提出新的方案使德國接受，甚至於更進一步，與世界正義力量呼應結合起來，一舉而撲滅侵略的在燄。</p>

<p>自工部局發售平價洋米後、平民受惠、工部局之港米陸續運來越南·緬甸·爪哇等處之客貨洋米、亦依然源源而至、昨日怡和洋行日陞輪、於中午抵埠、自仰光運來大批洋米計有一萬九千九百九十四包之多、停靠紅口順泰碼頭起卸、該米係遠東商行所採購、又有華綸洋行經理之美輪Florence號、昨日傍晚到滬、亦由仰光運來大量洋米、有四萬包之鉅、停靠浦東隆茂碼頭起卸、該米係撻孚洋行採辦、尚有大批買米、在來滬途中、</p>

<p>目下售價　仍無更改</p>
<p>是項提高訂購價格、須俟業巳到滬及在本月底前運滬之平價洋米總數二十八萬餘包、完全售罄後、下月份二批洋米　埠發售時、始開始實行、至岑售每石究竟定價若干、屆時當另有工部局通吿、米號亦當另行懸牌、故目下各米號門售工部局小絞米價格、每石仍為一百十元、</p>

<h3 id="c67">電車加價的商榷 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>電車加價，已是勢在必行，但站在市民的立塲上，却又有說不出的苦處，簡直連僅有的一點趁雷車的　利，都將遭受剝奪了。</p>
<p>因此，我們仍將不避厭煩的再竭誠地提出我們的要求與理由來，盼望能站在顧全人民半活的立　上，再加考慮。到底議案並不是鐵打的巨像，其實，即使是鐵打成的，也還可以冉經過溶化而鑄成另一種形象的，想來這決不是不可能的吧！</p>
<p>公司的理由為「投資純益銳减」。</p>
<p>可是，得注意兩點：「開源」雖然是一種法子，但「節流」也伺嘗不重要：其决，支出是「浩大」的，但在這「浩大」中間，是不是有「漏洞」，是吾有不應有的耗蝕。</p>
<p>關於這樁事情，我們趁客瞭解得最熟悉。——給了　，不給車票的是一種；給他兩　而付一角或是幾分錢車票的又是一種。這樣的「揩油」，在公司的收入上，無疑得打上一個很大的折扣，於是，結果，公司為了「投資純益銳减」，就又得來一次「加價」了！而這樣下去，「加價」就永無休止時候了</p>
<p>可是，公司不是用有大量的查票嗎？但是，查票在今天是失却了效用，我們不是常見賣票「兇毆」查票的新聞嗎？因為怕被打，而公司沒有辦法加以保障，於是查票的就祇得「眼開眼閉」起來了，而「查票無用　」，也就有了根據。</p>
<p>因此，在電車裹我們時時刻會聽到賣票人的怒吼——「喂，朋友阿拉「揩油」勿是揩儂個，要儂多管啥閒事！」有的來客是相信了，有的不相信，就會挨上一頓臭駡。出了錢，被揩了去，反還遭到一頓臭駡，實在太豈有此理了，而結果呢，公司為了要賺到「一定標準的利純」而加了車價，倒霉的又是趁客。</p>
<p>這裹我們提出具體的辦法來，希望公司能採　：</p>
<p>第一，儘量發揮由趁客監督賣票人實行「付給之車資必須與車票價値相等」的規則的力量，因為祇有道樣，才節代替了無數查票人的工作，而公司的收入，我堅決的相信一定會增加到百分之四十以上。</p>
<p>第二，給查票者以切實的保障，而免得遭受意外的禍患，來幫同上述　構的更健全的發展，而使賣票人在到處「建設」的「電臺」（即通風　訊者，醫如前面站頭上有「三號紅毛」等等，而　賣票的揩油可以安心做去，如有危險，「電臺」可以「解救」。）失其效用，這也是公司方面所必須調整的。</p>
<p>第三，公司自己最好將賺錢的　準放低些，因為，今日的　匯有「早晚市價的不同」，而公司的　純也就在趁客頭上了，所以我們希望公司能放棄這一標準最好，至少也該放低，而把外滙從「平均數」上先核定下來，免得臨時再漲價。</p>
<p>上面是關於公司的一方面，而筆者却不是公司的　兇來絞殺賣票人。這裹中要的是為了我們絕大多數的趁客呼籲。</p>
<p>至於賣票方面，我們的意見是這樣的：</p>
<p>（五）　公司坦白地公佈賣票人的薪水，津貼，米貼等，每人每月可得多少，而這個數字，是吾已可維持他們的生活費，這一點，可由社會人士根據工部局每月發表的生活指數，予以最公正的判斷，而以適合他們能安度生活為原則，如果公司的薪給是少，而必須揩油者，那末咎在資方；如果公司的薪給，在公正的判斷下，認為已可維持今日的生活，而他們還要揩油，而把揩在乘客頭上的錢，去用在不正當消耗上面，那末，趁客是義不容辭的該挺身而出來制裁這種漫無止境的不法行為的。</p>
<p>我們的這一建議，相信是決不偏袒仟何一方的，希望大家能加以探討和執行</p>
<p>而對公司方面，我們就希望他們能即將賣票，查票　人員之薪給數目供諸社會人士，作　最公正的評議，因為這還是決定前面幾點辦法的先決條件！</p>
<p>我們盼望公司能坦白地公佈出來以後，對「揩油問題有妥善的處置，對「加價問題」也能有從長計議的餘地，我們急切地期望着！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的莊稼人</p>
<p>自從聽到政局發生大變化的第一秒鐘起，在他平靜了好幾年的心坎上，頓時像已死的火山突然又復活一樣的噴出了一股活火來。他想會不會由於這一次的時局的變化，而使作了多年威福的袁寶藩同歸於盡，甚至給予湘綺一個重獲自由的機會。</p>
<p>這一個幻想，兩三天來，已在他腦神經上　旋了幾百决，甚至幾千决了，但同時他的過去的閱歷又一再向他警告着：失勢而下野的軍閥，很少有一敗塗地的，十有八九總是挾着他所積聚的賤貨，逃進租界裹去，舒舒服服的過着神仙般的寓公生活。假使袁賣藩的下塲也是這樣的話，羅湘綺又何能回復自由呢？</p>
<p>存款的發生危險和那奶媽子的要求回去，果然都像鋼架似的扣住了他的心，幾乎使他覺得氣也喘不過來，可是只要他一想到：</p>
<p>「或許湘綺可以回來了！」他的精神便立刻興奮了許多。</p>
<p>「鏜……鏜……鏜……」一架檯鐘突然打破了沉寂的冬夜，接連着敲了十下。</p>
<p>這架鐘的位置就在一張梨花木的方桌的中央，兩邊有一副珊瑚笺裱的小對，還是他才蓋這所屋子的時候，特地向京裹一個名士要來的；秀逸的王字，寫出了很自然的集句，上下聯裹還嵌着他的藝名，雖然次序略略的顚倒了些：</p>
<p>「海棠開後燕干來時黃昏庭院　紅粉牆頭秋千影裹臨水人家」</p>
<p>他反剪着雙手，向這一副色澤已不很鮮明的小對注視了好一會，然後父從對上看到鐘上，再從鐘上看到屋子裹的桌椅，以及一切的陳設。</p>

<h3 id="c70">兒子 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>二毛娘有個二毛；尖嘴乾媽有個乾兒子。</p>
<p>二毛才十九歲；乾兒子却已經是「而立」之年了。</p>
<p>如果，有機會把他們兩口子拉在起，那末二毛就會顯得非常之「相形見絀」；其貌旣不揚於上，其衣又襤褸於下。</p>
<p>就這一點，已經很够　尖嘴乾媽作為一個白分之百充足的理由了——「我的兒子比她的好！」</p>
<p>二毛娘並不喜歡說自己的兒子好，她往往（也可以說常常）想得很遠很遠，很高很高，高過使衖堂裹的「閑雜人等」統叫她「神經病」。</p>
<p>允其是尖嘴乾媽！</p>
<p>媽媽「神經」，兒子自然就變成「小神經」，於是「神母經子」的一舉一動，就成了衆矢之的。</p>
<p>安安逸逸，二個月逃走了：是第四個月的頭一天，下午五點零七分（或者八分），事情發生了！</p>
<p>當乾兒子捧了一大包「外國糖」回來的時候，後面跟着伸進一個鬼小鬼小的頭；「二毛跑了！」</p>
<p>霎那，尖嘴乾媽忽然有了　樣的感覺，她在二毛之走和乾兒　買糖回來的對比之下……拐着腿霍地穿過去，叫了一聲冉沒有第二個人能够叫得出的『好…兒…子…』</p>
<p>乾兒子受子無愧，却之不成體統，『乾媽你好……』來而不往非禮也！</p>
<p>街堂裏每一家人家就像個無綫電發報機，不到吃一碗飯的時間都知道了二毛的事情；於是二毛娘的屋子裹就不很平常地擠滿了一大堆「關心」她的男的女的老的少的——子全伸得同殺頭差不多長，無他，無非想知道二毛到底，「何往也」以後，晚上可以有了談天的資料。</p>
<p>「他媽？」二毛娘眼睛又似乎望着遠遠的高高的，「他到一個很好的地力去做好的事……」</p>
<p>立刻：</p>
<p>神經病？神經病。神經病！</p>
<p>乾兒子今天特別「氣慨」；尖嘴乾媽眼睛笑成一條縫——「早說，我的兒子比她的好！」</p>
<p>吃「外國糖」……</p>

<h3 id="c71">賈璧雲軼事 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>賈璧　死矣，老伶工又弱一個！二十年前，璧雲聲譽極盛，民四五之間，於故都與朱幼芬，梅畹華爭旦行寶座，一時評劇家流，逞其筆鋒，各獻身子，鸛鵝列陣，如火如荼！時朱幼芬方以靑衣正工獨步故都，湘人劉少少主中國公報筆政，于幼芬捧之允力，贈以長律，有「終當美旦人間世，何必生超色界天。呼得羣龍齊俯首，擁君高立玉山巓。」化工有數文章筆，妙相無遮歌舞臺。」等句，更仿六朝體作勸進文，有云南米人，北來人，合詞具箋之詞，奇文遐想，倍極推崇！此際捧璧雲者亦夥，少少又于報上為二人競選甲乙，結果，幼芬以多一票膺首席，畹華見報，為之不平，少少復以朱梅比較登報決選，畹華亦復不敵。於是朱與賈也，朱與梅也，黨之者羣起紛爭，歷時累月，攻擊不已，有署名云云者，作書　少少及怡梅館主調停其事，略謂：「一伶之美，兩君皆就上裝時評之，不知朱演正旦，固貴矜莊，賈演花旦，亦宜妖冶，上裝時態度之莊佻，不足為二伶妍媸定評，……請以東坡詩：「短長靶瘦各有　，飛燕玉環誰敢憎，」為諸公解紛，一塲論爭，至此遂告一段落，是亦可見當時都人士傾倒璧雲之一斑矣！實則當時文人墨客，以至於遜國臣工，其微歌蓋無不以選色為主旨，次及劇藝，審美之點小同，故論爭亦異。幼芬之劇我未覩，至於畹　璧雲，則「雅」俗，固小可同日而語也。觀夫畹　飲譽之始終不衰，璧雲晚年之鬱鬱不得志，於此可信，抑亦有幸有不幸耶？</p>

<p>「古剎驚夢」演員們，是中國平劇的藝員，但是用西洋音樂配台的，這是最大的特點。這小是投機的嘗試，而是音樂家阿父夏莫洛夫氏的心血結晶。演員的練習，不過幾個月，而且並不是怎樣的名角，經過道音樂配合了，却使人有特殊的感　。而　劇本取材也平凡得很，這可以說是音樂的成功，是很合理的。由無聲需影到有聲　影是　步，但由歌舞劇到啞劇也絕對地是　步。他們將要到美國去表演，自無需中國歌唱對白，眞是再合適沒有了。</p>
<p>全劇分三幕演出，有緊張的地方，有幻想的地方，有怡　的地方。在音樂方面用各種不同的方式奏出，即是聽慣交響曲要聽，而聽慣爵士曲也要聽。有西洋的藝術，也有東方的風味。惜乎演員們和曲子節奏富有不調　的地方，但究竟是件不輕易的工作，而且為時甚暫，也算得是很大的成功的了。這位音樂家，是短短的身材，他有銳和的目光，據他自己說，對於中國戲劇發生很濃厚的興趣。這「古刹驚夢」便是他傑作之一，值得一看。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Another Anti-Axis Action by the US: Order to Close German Consulates; Nazi Propagandists to be Forced to Leave; US-German Relations on the Brink of Severance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 17th – Well-informed sources here predicted last night that major events would occur soon, perhaps this week. They believe the expulsion of German consuls is not an isolated incident but the first step in a series of actions. Roosevelt's minor illness is now completely healed, but he has canceled all social engagements this week to focus on important work, further indicating that major events are imminent.</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 17th – The worsening of US-German relations is evident in yesterday's announcement of the closure of all German consulates in the US and the withdrawal of all personnel associated with the consulates. This announcement was made by Under Secretary of State Welles after delivering a note to the German Embassy. Not only will German consulates be closed, but also the German Information Library, railway and tourist information offices, and the Transocean News Agency. Welles stated that this action does not imply a severance of diplomatic relations with Germany, will not affect German diplomats in Washington, and is unrelated to the sinking of the "Robin Moor." Rather, it is due to German consulate personnel and other Nazi organizations engaging in activities harmful to the United States. Welles said that the US government is aware that German consulates are engaging in activities outside their legitimate functions, activities that are improper and should not be allowed. "I am instructed by the President to request the German government to withdraw all Germans associated with the German Information Library, railway and tourist information offices, and the Transocean News Agency in the US and New York, and to close the aforementioned agencies and their affiliates as soon as possible. I am further instructed to request that German consulate personnel, acting officers, and German employees of the consulates leave the US, and that the consulates be closed down completely. It is expected that these withdrawals and closures will be completed by July 7th," he said. Welles told reporters that the government is not currently considering similar actions against other countries like Italy. Germany has a total of 24 consulates in the US, the largest being in New York, with one consul general and five consuls and vice-consuls. Captain Wiedemann, the former adjutant to Hitler and German consul in San Francisco, is also among those who must withdraw.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th – 152 German consuls and 23 German employees and translators will be affected by President Roosevelt's order to close Nazi consulates and propaganda agencies. Forty-two employees of the German Information Library will be the primary targets of deportation. However, officials said that German consuls and employees will be safely returned to their country, adding that federal agencies have been closely monitoring the activities of Axis consulates for several months. The activities of the agencies appointed by the German Information Library and German travel agencies have also been closely monitored. Information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed that the German Information Library is the most important Nazi propaganda agency in the US. The US Immigration Department recently denied entry to 20 Germans requested by the Information Library and ordered their return home. The US State Department also warned the German ambassador and Axis consuls that any interference in US domestic affairs would result in expulsion.</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 17th – Congressmen are generally satisfied with the closure of German consulates. Democrat Lansburgh called it "a good move." Republican Hess called it "a preliminary step toward severing diplomatic relations, as in 1917." Republican Duncan called it "a step-by-step approach."</p>
<p>This Order Applies to the Philippines, Dealing a Second Severe Blow to Germany</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th – President Roosevelt's order to close German consulates and propaganda agencies may lead to a severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The order affects as many as 24 offices, including those in the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, and US territories outside the continental US, such as the Philippines. State Department officials said that the German consulate in Manila is also included. It is understood that US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, has long hoped for this action. While the German Transocean News Agency in the US has been ordered to close, the German official news agency in Washington is apparently unaffected. This US order is the second major diplomatic blow to Germany in recent days. Coincidentally, Treasury Assistant Secretary Feil announced that Italian organizations in the US are also subject to the "freezing" order that goes into effect this week. The Treasury also issued several general notices allowing the movement of funds belonging to Sweden and the Vatican that were affected by the freezing order. However, no such notice was issued for Soviet funds, pending assurances from Moscow that the notices would not be used to evade the freezing order. The authorities did not explain why the US decided to close German consulates but not Italian consulates.</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 17th – According to news released here today, the German consul in Manila told visiting reporters today that he had not yet received instructions from his government or US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, to close the German consulate following Washington's order to close all Nazi consulates in the US. However, observers generally believe that the US decision to close German consulates in the US will also apply to Nazi consulates in the Philippines. It is also reported that US High Commissioner Sayre has urged Washington to request the withdrawal of the German consulate in the Philippines.</p>
<p>German Nationals Feel Like a Bolt from the Blue; Berlin May Retaliate</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 17th – The first reaction here after Under Secretary Welles announced the closure of German consulates is that this is an unprecedented move toward severing diplomatic relations. Will Germany accept the US action, such as establishing the Atlantic Patrol, which is a major blow to German prestige, without retaliation? Even if Germany tolerates it, the order to expel German consuls is embarrassing to the German side. When Welles announced this at the press conference, those present felt like a bolt from the blue. The reporter from the German official news agency was also present. Upon hearing the news, the reporters rushed out to find telephones and transmit this important news. It is well known that the New York Information Library is one of the main German propaganda agencies. It is suspected that German consulates in the US spent less time handling purely consular affairs and more time recruiting German nationals and German-Americans who are more loyal to their homeland than to their adopted country, and that they were bribed with money. The authorities were aware of this. The German organization in the Americas will be greatly affected by this blow. Although some diplomats may remain, they cannot hope to continue the work of all the large-scale German organizations in the US. Washington observers also said that it is not surprising that Latin American countries may take the same approach as the US.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th – Government officials predicted last night that Germany would retaliate immediately to President Roosevelt's order to expel German consulate staff and propaganda agencies in the US. They believe that Germany's first act of retaliation will be to demand that the US close its consulates in Berlin, Bremen, Cologne, Dresden, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Leipzig, and Frankfurt. Officials also believe that Germany may close consulates in Nazi-occupied territories, such as Paris, Le Havre, Beijing, Tianjin, and southern regions. Congress has generally reacted positively to President Roosevelt's move.</p>
<p>Transocean News Agency, Berlin, 17th – Regarding the US government's order to close German consulates in the US and "freeze" German deposits in the US, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman did not comment today. The spokesman told foreign reporters that Berlin has not yet received detailed information about the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Roosevelt Receives Important Military and Political Figures <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Transocean News Agency, Washington, 17th – President Roosevelt received several important figures yesterday, including British Ambassador Lord Halifax, US Secretary of War Stimson, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, and Chief of the Army Air Corps Arnold. Roosevelt has not yet fully recovered and has canceled his trip to Hyde Park and Boston. The content of his conversations with the military and political figures is unknown.</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 17th – President Roosevelt said that he had intended to personally greet Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard in Philadelphia and accompany them to the President's estate in Hyde Park. Now that the President has canceled his trip, Juliana and others will stay in Washington briefly.</p>
<p>US Watches the Evolution of the Situation in the Far East; Reckless Actions by Japan Would Be Suicide</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 17th – The freezing of Axis assets in the US and the expulsion of Nazi consuls and journalists in the US have led people here to speculate that the US is now moving forward quickly and will join forces with Britain. Some well-informed sources predict that there will be major developments soon, perhaps this week. A severance of diplomatic relations with Germany would no longer be surprising. All subsequent developments are possible, and aid to Britain may become more active than any public announcement. The evolution of events will inevitably lead the US to a state of full belligerency. In this regard, some people are predicting how Japan will fulfill its obligations to the Axis powers. As far as is known here, those who want Japan to fulfill its promises to the Axis powers and become a totalitarian state include figures like Toshi Go. It is doubtful whether these people hold real power to direct the country through this complex political and diplomatic situation in the East and Europe. Cautious observers here believe that the US does not want to fight in the Pacific or conduct a two-ocean war, but if forced to do so, the US is definitely prepared for it. In this regard, there have been some interesting rumors involving naval policy. It is said that a key section of the Navy believes that when the US enters the war, its battleships will not be necessary for the Atlantic War, as the German and Italian main fleets have been reduced to insignificant military forces. The US only needs cruisers, destroyers, and aircraft carriers to cope with the Atlantic War. Moreover, although the British main fleet has suffered the losses of the "Royal Oak" and "Hood," it is still powerful and even stronger than before. It is said that those who hold this view believe that new battleships should be sent to the Pacific rather than the Atlantic. If this view is adopted, the US entire main fleet will be based in Hawaii. Once a superior battle fleet is stationed in Hawaiian waters, if the Japanese fleet attempts to take action against the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, or intends to fulfill its Axis alliance and declare war on the US, it would be tantamount to suicide. This US fleet has 16 battleships in service and two that have been launched for trials. What kind of trend will the situation take when Japan's reply to the Dutch East Indies is released, and what actions will Japan take if the Dutch East Indies rejects this reply, as generally expected? These are all being closely watched by observers here.</p>
<h3 id="e3">US Government Bans Oil Shipments to Japan; Japan Denies Secret Agreement with Germany; Soviet-Japanese Trade Negotiations Underway <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th – Interior Secretary Ickes yesterday instructed customs officials to prevent the shipment of 252,000 gallons of lubricating oil from Philadelphia to Japan. A spokesman for the Interior Department said that the suspension of US oil shipments has nothing to do with oil policy, but is "in cooperation with obtaining oil supplies on the East Coast." The spokesman also said, "Ickes is currently asking Export Control Administrator Maxwell Welles to consider banning oil exports from the East Coast to cope with the oil shortage on the coast."</p>
<p>United Press, London, 17th – A reliable non-British diplomatic source here announced yesterday that Germany and Japan have signed an agreement stipulating that Japan will exchange a large number of tropical products for German arms. The source said that Japan will exchange rubber, tin, and vegetable oil for Nazi weapons. The source also said that Japan's decision to invade the Dutch East Indies to obtain these products to meet Hitler's needs will depend on whether Japan needs German military equipment and is even willing to take risks in the Pacific. The same source said that when German arms are transported to Japan through the Soviet Union in the future, the Soviet Union will not implement the recent ban on arms transit.</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 17th – At a press conference today, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii said that reports from London, based on diplomatic sources, that Japan and Germany have recently signed a secret agreement in which Japan agrees to supply Germany with rubber, tin, and vegetable oil, and Germany supplies Japan with weapons, are pure rumors. He then mentioned the new Japanese-Soviet trade negotiations, saying that the majority of Japanese-Soviet trade will take place via the Siberian Railway, but these negotiations are still underway. A government spokesman also stated that Japan and the Soviet Union are currently discussing methods of transporting goods via the Siberian Railway, and this discussion involves both freight rates and the quantity of goods transported.</p>

<p>United Press, New York, 17th – The sale of oil to Japan by American companies has been criticized by outsiders. Mobil Oil Company of New Jersey yesterday issued a defense for this matter, stating that private enterprises should follow government policies and cannot automatically establish bans. In its annual report to employees, the company said that Mobil Oil Company, half of whose shares are owned by Standard Oil Company, had jointly supplied oil to Japan with British and Dutch oil companies and had notified the British, American, and Dutch East Indies governments of this agreement.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Review of the Tense Relations Between Germany and the Soviet Union <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Recently, relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have once again reached a tense and delicate stage. Counting up, this is the fifth time since the war. Looking back, there was the tacit understanding to divide Poland at the beginning of the European War, the hostile crisis in Northern Europe in 1940, the mutual rivalry for spheres of influence in the Balkans in early spring of this year, and, a month ago, the German-Italian "passing through" Turkey to attack the Suez Canal and the Middle East, suddenly making demands of Soviet Turkey. All of the above show that crises caused by German-Soviet suspicion are endless. When the talk of passing through Turkey and dividing the Middle East was rampant, the whole world was shocked, and the United Kingdom and the United States were allowed to express their concerns; but in the end, due to the firm stance of Soviet Turkey, a major international crisis was eliminated, forcing Germany and Italy to shift their goals and concentrate their efforts on the blitzkrieg of Crete. However, after occupying Crete, the German-Italian allied forces temporarily suspended military operations, and at this time suddenly took a threatening stance to re-raise demands to the Soviet Union, causing the current very tense situation. What is the truth? With the mystery of Germany and the Soviet Union, it will probably not be known until the final revelation; however, summarizing the dispatches from various places in the past few days, we can probably get a few points: (1) Germany now attaches importance to its relations with the Soviet Union, more than to the progress of the war with the United Kingdom. (2) The Soviet Union's attitude towards the so-called "New Order" is the most basic issue in the eyes of Germany and Italy; even if it does not participate, it must express tacit understanding or understanding. (3) Economically, the Soviet Union further supports Germany and Italy, enabling them to conduct a long-term war with the combined forces of the United Kingdom and the United States. (4) Militarily, Germany and Italy are still trying to attack by land; this point proves that the experiment of the Crete-style blitzkrieg strategy was a failure for Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Before the Battle of Crete, when Germany and Italy made demands on the Soviet Union and Turkey to pass through, the Nazi leader Hess suddenly flew to England. At that time, the situation was very clear: to the United Kingdom and the United States, Hitler wanted to use the old tune of further cooperation with the Soviet Union to encourage the rise of appeasement and isolationist factions, in order to relax the United Kingdom's and the United States' fighting spirit and preparation; to the Soviet Union, he was still using the means of so-called "negotiated peace" with the United Kingdom to force the Soviet Union and Turkey to accept all his demands. However, the firmness of the Soviet Union and Turkey and the denunciation of the peace offensive by the United Kingdom and the United States shattered Hitler's dream. At present, Germany and Italy do not have any new peace offensive to cooperate with their negotiations with the Soviet Union, which is much weaker in momentum than the previous time; and the European democratic countries have recently issued a declaration in London to completely defeat Hitlerism, which is undoubtedly blocking the possibility of Germany and Italy launching any peace offensive. This time, Germany and Italy have only been forced to concentrate large forces on the Soviet border to cooperate with their negotiations with the Soviet Union; however, the Soviet Union has also responded with more powerful exercises of force. Therefore, judging from the negotiations themselves, the possibility of success for Germany this time is even more remote than the previous time.</p>
<p>Observing from a military and strategic point of view, the tension on the German-Soviet border in the past two days is more of a serious threat to Germany and Italy themselves than a serious threat to the Soviet Union. It is universally acknowledged that Germany, Italy, and Japan's aggression groups have absolutely no strength or courage to go to war with the Soviet Union in the midst of a life-and-death struggle with powerful enemies. Therefore, under the current circumstances, no matter what the actual number of military forces concentrated by Germany and the Soviet Union is, in fact, only the Soviet Union can take the initiative to attack Germany and Italy; and Germany can only try its best to avoid causing a head-on conflict with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the current concentration of German troops on the Soviet border is nothing more than empty threats, or an illusion. Moreover, a fatal point of the economic resources and external routes of Germany, Italy, and Japan has long been grasped by the Soviet Union. In the event that they go to war with the Soviet Union, no matter what the final victory is, the three aggressive partners will first lose contact, and the possibility of mutual adjustment of all materials will be completely lost; and with the elimination of concerns about competition with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States can of course further tighten the naval blockade, completely cut off the overseas supply of the three countries, and accelerate their collapse. At that time, what is placed in front of them is either being finally defeated by military force, or sitting and waiting for the depletion of resources, falling into unprecedented famine, and being forced to surrender. Therefore, taking everything together, in this Soviet-German negotiation, no matter what demands Germany makes, the Soviet Union always has great room for operation: it can reject them all, it can accept them partially or conditionally, it can modify them or propose new plans for Germany to accept, or even further, it can echo and combine with the world's forces of justice, and wipe out the flames of aggression in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest crisis in the current international situation does not lie in the continued increase and advancement of the forces of the aggressive groups, but in how the forces of justice in the world can combine.</p>
<h3 id="e6">National Finance Conference Opening Day Lin and Chiang Personally Deliver Training Speeches Reorganizing Land Tax and Improving the Financial System Two Important Cases of Greatest National Importance <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Chiang Kai-shek attended yesterday's opening of the National Finance Conference and stated that the government must rely on land tax and grain tax as the main sources of national tax revenue, replacing customs duties and salt taxes. The government will implement grain rationing immediately after this year's tax collection. The government is currently working to promote the new county system in order to implement local autonomy as soon as possible, and will make fair adjustments to the war burden, so that the wealthy bear the main part of the donation tax for the poor. In addition, efforts will be made to accelerate the implementation of the land and food policies set by the National Father, Sun Yat-sen. When Finance Minister Kung gave a speech, he declared that the two trade organizations, Fuxing and Fuhua, would be merged into one, and would cooperate more closely with the New York Universal Trading Company. The new organization, named Fuxing, will handle the export of wood, oil, tin, wool, bristles, and raw silk in Chongqing. (17th Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing When the Third National Finance Conference opened this morning, President Chiang personally delivered a speech, which lasted forty minutes. He stressed that the purpose of this conference is twofold: one is to balance revenue and expenditure, and the other is to equalize the burden. (16th Havas)</p>
<p>Chongqing Chairman Lin delivered a training speech at the Third National Finance Conference on the 16th, saying, "President, fellow members, today is the opening ceremony of the Third National Finance Conference. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words. The war has been going on for four full years. At the same time, the arduous and important work of national construction has been cultivated with a deep foundation after four years of hard work. This precious result is due to the diligence and dedication of public officials, hard work, and the unity of the national people in contributing their wealth and strength. However, the financial officers' careful planning and appropriate fundraising have made indelible and great contributions to the country. The cost of resisting and building the country is huge, many times more than usual, but the financial supply has been inexhaustible for several years, without any worries of insufficient resources, and the adjustment has been effective, without the fear of favoring one over the other. At the opening of this Third National Finance Conference, I should first express my deep commendation and infinite admiration to you all. This National Finance Conference has a more significant mission than the previous two conferences. The main agenda items are the centralization of land tax collection and reorganization, and the improvement of the financial system. This is an important resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which is of great importance to the future of resistance and construction. The improvement of the financial system is a basic condition for establishing a modern country. Since the central government and local governments are one body, there must be close ties. Therefore, the financial aspect should be unified and handled by the central government in a coordinated manner, so as to give full play to the effect of reorganization and strengthen financial power. Moreover, the reasonable allocation of tax laws can achieve fairness, and the revenue and expenditure of the central and local governments can also be adjusted, and the national economic construction will also achieve balanced development through financial adjustment. The centralization of land tax collection and reorganization is a practical and good method for improving the financial system. Both aim to enrich the country and benefit the people's livelihood, and both are to meet the needs of resistance and construction. However, how to effectively implement these two excellent methods throughout the country without hindrance depends on your detailed discussions and meticulous planning. As for the implementation of the new county system, it is an important policy to improve the grassroots organization and promote local autonomy. How to raise funds to ensure its smooth implementation is also an important and urgent issue. In addition, how should the current local taxes be reorganized? How should the tax law be revised? How should local economic construction be coordinated? And issues such as trade and food are also closely related to resistance and construction. All of these require you to take into account the overall situation, carefully consider, and formulate concrete and practical measures. In short, the agenda of this conference is extremely important to the future of the country, and this important responsibility rests on your shoulders. You are either the backbone of the financial world or experts in financial science.

<p>Kung Hsiang-hsi's Financial Report</p>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Since 1937, four years have passed in an instant. The Ministry, adhering to the Central Government's fundamental national policy, has strived to coordinate all financial measures with the environment and adapt them to the actual needs of the country. Ten aspects of the guidelines and plans have been determined: (1) Regarding the economy of expenditures, unnecessary expenditures should be reduced as much as possible, so as to tighten general administrative expenditures, support war expenditures, and actively promote economic construction, so that national construction work can still be carried out in the midst of difficulties, develop resources, and concentrate efforts to achieve the goal of winning the war and building the country; (2) Regarding the improvement of the tax system, earnestly promote income tax, inheritance tax, and wartime excess profits tax, implement the principle of "those with money contribute money," and at the same time plan wartime consumption tax and reorganize old taxes such as customs duties, so as to increase tax revenue; (3) Regarding the maintenance of public debt credit, the Ministry has reorganized domestic and foreign debts, and has been able to repay the principal and interest on schedule, maintaining credit. Recently, it has expanded the war bond solicitation campaign, so that people at home and abroad can enthusiastically subscribe to wartime public bonds; (4) Regarding the replenishment of legal tender reserves, in recent years, domestic gold and silver have been purchased and exchanged to replenish cash reserves. At the same time, the export of foreign exchange has been concentrated, and overseas remittances have been absorbed as much as possible to thicken foreign exchange reserves and consolidate the foundation of legal tender. Recently, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, in order to assist China in enhancing the credit of legal tender, stabilizing domestic prices, and expanding international trade, have signed the Sino-British and Sino-American Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Agreements with the Chinese government, and have jointly organized the Stabilization Fund Management Committee, so that the credit of legal tender in the international arena has become more consolidated; (5) Regarding the soundness of financial institutions, finance and finance should be closely linked. Therefore, the joint office of the four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, was organized to strengthen the central financial hub. At the same time, the Interim Measures for the Management of Banks during the Extraordinary Period were implemented, strictly prohibiting banks from directly engaging in commerce, hoarding goods, or engaging in business in their own name or on behalf of customers under the names of agency departments, trade departments, and trust departments, so as to crack down on financial institutions hoarding and speculation and prevent excessive price increases; (6) Regarding the regulation of material supply, promoting wartime production, maintaining overseas markets, regulating material supply and demand, and implementing centralized procurement and sales are the important tasks separately shouldered by the Ministry's Trade Commission and the Central Trust Bureau. The actual operation of export trade is the responsibility of (1) Fuxing, (2) Fuhua, and (3) China Tea, which are affiliated to the Trade Commission. They are responsible for the trade of (1) tung oil and tin, (2) wool, bristles, and raw silk, and (3) tea and other export commodities. Recently, in order to concentrate management and improve efficiency, Fuhua Trading Company was merged into Fuxing Commercial Company, and further close cooperation with the World Trade Corporation of New York, USA, was sought; (7) Regarding the supervision of local finance, the Ministry has, in recent years, urged the abolishment of donations and taxes that hinder the development of industry, so as to benefit the development of the national economy, and to rectify local financial administration, so as to increase the income of the national treasury. At the same time, it has strengthened the central government's supervision of local financial power, and actively reorganized county finance, so that local finance can be brought into line, so as to promote the sound development of local administration and undertakings; (8) Regarding the handling of finance in war zones, the Ministry, taking into account the actual situation of finance in war zones, has formulated various appropriate handling methods, and has improved them separately, so as to reduce the burden on the people; (9) Regarding the promotion of savings, actively promote national savings, encourage savings, so that people can use their surplus funds to purchase public bonds or savings bonds for national construction, so as to realize the spirit of financial mobilization. At the same time, make full use of foreign investment or overseas Chinese investment, cultivate production, and develop resources, so as to strengthen the financial power of the period and prepare for post-war economic recovery; (10) Regarding the implementation of personnel management and training, the Ministry has established a Personnel Department to be responsible for handling personnel management and training, so as to lay the foundation for sound financial administration. At the same time, it will earnestly implement the administrative system of (1) planning, (2) execution, and (3) assessment, so as to seek the sound development of financial construction. The above ten guidelines are all of great importance. It is hoped that this conference will make a definite contribution to the central government, and it is expected that the financial personnel of each city will be able to actively promote and implement them in accordance with the central government's instructions. China's financial finance has been able to cooperate with each other and provide sufficient supplies in the four years of the war. The reason why it has been able to fulfill its due mission during this period is that the financial measures before the war have been actively promoted and a deep foundation has been laid to adapt to the needs of the war. In the early spring of the previous year, the Central Government, with the beginning of the second phase of the war, held the Fifth Plenary Session and decided on the guidelines for the second phase of the war, and approved the two-year administrative plan, which listed in detail the financial facilities for the next two years. The Ministry has also formulated a two-year plan and implementation plan in accordance with this plan, with each three months as a period, detailing the steps to be taken, counting the days to success. This plan either continues the previous measures and earnestly implements them, or creates wartime needs, all based on the principle of being realistic and pragmatic, and advancing in different ways to seek thoroughness. The Eighth Plenary Session was held this year, and it was further passed (1) to change the financial revenue and expenditure system, reorganize the distribution to meet the needs of resistance and construction, and lay the foundation for autonomy, so that national undertakings can achieve balanced development; (2) in order to adapt to wartime needs, it is proposed to temporarily transfer the land tax of each province to the central government for management, so as to plan and organize it; (3) in order to balance grain prices, regulate people's food, and use and improve the existing grassroots organizations for folk grain and salt transactions and their management methods; (4) to hold a monopoly on consumer goods, so as to regulate the supply and demand, and the fair market. Important resolutions such as the plan were made. The Ministry has decided to convene this National Finance Conference for the organization of wartime national land tax, the adjustment of the financial system, the reform of local donations and taxes, and the planning of various expenses required after the implementation of the county system, in order to gather the responsible authorities of financial administration in various provinces and cities, as well as economic and financial experts from all over the country, to discuss the implementation of the important proposals decided by the Eighth Plenary Session, such as the temporary transfer of the land tax of each province to the central government for management, and the thorough improvement of the financial revenue and expenditure system, and the responsible authorities of each province are also expected to take advantage of this rare opportunity to concentrate their efforts and discuss them thoroughly. If there are still any obstacles or difficulties, it is hoped that they will know everything and say everything, and earnestly point them out and plan for solutions. The Central Government and local governments are one body. At this critical moment of approaching victory, all those who are engaged in financial administration are the basic cadres of the national financial administration and must share the responsibility of the country and forget their own interests, and work together to promote the national financial system and the autonomous financial system decided by the Eighth Plenary Session with the joint efforts of national financial personnel, so that they can be promoted and realized perfectly. Then, not only will it benefit the resistance and construction, but also the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit deeply. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">British Troops Advance Towards Damascus The Vanguard Is Only A Few Miles From The City British And French Warships Exchange Heavy Fire At The Harbor Allied Forces Occupy Jaysing Town In The Western Cedar District <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 17th: Recent public statements indicate that, while the British have declared their policy of avoiding unnecessary force, fierce fighting has broken out in Syria. The Allied forces are penetrating deeper into Syria, and the Vichy forces are resisting more stubbornly. The war has spread to other areas. Radio Lyons broadcast a French communiqué stating that, along the Syrian coast, a British column, after reaching west of Sidon, has not advanced. In a key area on the front line, the French forces have counterattacked. A responsible spokesperson broadcast that the Allied forces outside Damascus are very strong. The city's southeast has steep mountains and orchards that can be used for defense. It is expected that the Allied forces will have to encircle the city from the north to attack. At the same time, in the coastal area around Sidon, French medium tanks are putting up stubborn resistance. However, the British Navy has been shelling them fiercely, and the road behind the city has also been shelled by the British Navy. A Vichy motorized column departing from Beirut to reinforce the area was intercepted and retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 17th: Yesterday, French forces launched fierce counterattacks on most of the Syrian front lines, attempting to prevent the Allied forces from occupying Damascus and Beirut. However, French officials admitted that British troops had advanced to within ten miles of Damascus and were still advancing slowly. The Allied forces have captured Jaysing town in the western cedar district, which controls the Lebanese mountain area where the fighting is most intense. Officials stated that French planes severely damaged a British destroyer off the coast of Lebanon, and another destroyer also caught fire. Near Kisweh, eight of the Allied tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed on Sunday. French warships and planes launched a joint attack on British ships off the coast of Sidon on Sunday with successful results.</p>
<p>United Press, Beirut, 17th: A French destroyer engaged several British ships at the mouth of Beirut Bay at dawn yesterday. The battle could be seen from within the city. The two sides exchanged artillery fire for thirty minutes, and the houses and foundations in the city were shaken by the cannons. Residents were abruptly awakened. The British ships eventually retreated, and the French ships returned to port.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 17th: According to reliable sources, French Aviation Minister General Bergeret will command the French Air Force in Syria.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Damascus, 17th: This afternoon, rumors spread here that the United Kingdom was willing to negotiate peace with Syria. It was claimed that Dentz, the French High Commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, had, through an intermediary, conveyed to the British commander his desire for peace talks. Dentz pointed out that peace could be achieved if the British forces immediately ceased fire and resolved the dispute peacefully.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sidon, 17th: There was no street fighting when the Australian troops captured Sidon. The accurate bombing in the two days before the entry had forced the last of the French troops to retreat north. The mayor of Sidon surrendered immediately and led the Australian vehicles entering the suburbs, indicating the locations of machine gun positions and attackers along the way. Sidon was lost during the day. By the afternoon, all the shops and cafes had reopened, and life began to return to normal. Although many roads in the city were damaged and filled with destroyed military trucks, only three civilians were killed and twelve injured in the entire city. Food supplies in Sidon were extremely scarce due to the blockade, and prices rose sharply. According to an officer who opposed Vichy, Sidon could have been occupied with little fighting, but because General Dentz had personally visited the front line on Friday to encourage the soldiers, some sacrifices were inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Germany Is Resting Its Forces Preparing For A Major Offensive <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that Germany has shown a tendency towards silence in military, political, and propaganda aspects since occupying Crete. However, this silence may not last long. Undoubtedly, Germany has expended particularly great effort in the wars from the invasion of the two countries in southern Greece to the conquest of Crete, and it is necessary to replenish and restore its forces urgently. Therefore, it has temporarily become silent. However, Germany's military strength is huge, and those fighting in Southeastern Europe need to rest. The apparent cessation of Germany's general war machine has nothing to do with this. Therefore, Germany seems to be studying plans for new actions. If it decides to take a new offensive, there are many targets, and it will move its troops directly to the east, west, southeast, or southwest. But it will never stand still. Therefore, in the next few days, we can get clues as to where Hitler will move.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Libyan War Becomes Intense Again Main Battlefield Now At Halfaya It Is Said That The British Offensive At Sollum Was Frustrated <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 17th The triangular area between Sollum, the Capuzzo Fortress, and the Halfaya Pass on the Egyptian-Libyan border is still seeing a large number of armored vehicles engaged in fierce fighting. According to unconfirmed reports, the Allied forces have occupied the Capuzzo Fortress. British and Indian troops are cooperating to attack the Halfaya Pass and the south of the slope, while fighting is also taking place on the top of the slope west of Halfaya. Responsible individuals claim that the Allied forces have not launched a large-scale offensive. The fighting below is merely a continuation of the seesaw battles that have been taking place since the retreat from Benghazi. The movement of the Allied forces south of the slope has met with very little resistance. Currently, the main battlefield is at Halfaya. The real war has begun after the Allied forces attacked the relatively limited desert area around Halfaya. The key point is that although the two armies are fighting close to the east of Halfaya, they are currently encountering each other west of the pass. It is still too early to say what kind of development there will be in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: The Libyan war suddenly broke out again on Sunday. British troops clashed with the enemy south and southeast of Sollum. The fighting is still continuing. The intense air battles and bombings are another sign that the British commander is determined to attack the enemy's positions. The center of the fighting is concentrated around Sollum, Sidi Omar, and Halfaya. A large number of armored vehicles are participating in the battle. The British have British and Indian troops fighting. Fighting is taking place west of Halfaya.</p>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 17th: The General Headquarters Intelligence Department here announced today that the British Imperial forces launched a fierce counteroffensive in the Western Desert. The axis positions south and southeast of Sollum were attacked yesterday. The fighting is still going on. News from Berlin and Rome yesterday stated that the British military's fierce counteroffensive towards Sollum was frustrated.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Report of Soviet Request for British Guarantee: Unchanged Current Resistance Policy, Avoiding Chamberlain's Tactics Being Repeated in the Future; German Troops Massed on the Border, Posing a Serious Threat to the Soviet Union <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Havas News Agency) - According to highly reliable sources here, the Soviet Union is currently hoping that Britain will provide a guarantee to resist German pressure in the future. In other words, if war breaks out between the Soviet Union and Germany, the Soviet Union hopes that Britain can provide support. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, took the route through Sweden to return to London at the beginning of March, precisely to convey this wish of the Soviet Union to his home government. What the Soviet authorities are most concerned about is Britain's guarantee that if Germany launches a war against the Soviet Union, Britain will not change its current policy of resistance. Ever since Hess, a key figure in the German Social Democratic Party, fled to Britain, Stalin and his ilk have been deeply worried that British Prime Minister Churchill will follow Chamberlain's old tricks, pursue a policy of appeasement towards Germany, and harbor schadenfreude in the event of a German-Soviet conflict. In other words, Britain would take advantage of the German-Soviet conflict to sign a peace treaty with Germany, allowing Hitler to direct all his forces eastward, while Britain itself would remain neutral and stay out of the matter. Conversely, if Stalin can be sure that Britain has the determination and ability to resist, he will not hesitate to form an alliance with Britain. At that time, Britain will naturally have to accept certain conditions, such as recognizing the Soviet Union's annexation of Poland, the Baltic states, and the lands of Finland and Romania. In short, there are currently no fewer than 140 German divisions concentrated along the Soviet border. In the future, Stalin's choices will depend on Britain's attitude. As for the Far East, after the Soviet Union signed a commercial agreement with Japan, it suddenly accepted the results of the Soviet-Manchukuo border demarcation conference today. The Soviet Union is compromising with Japan in this way, simply because the situation in the West is urgent and it has no choice but to avoid triggering conflicts in the Far East.</p>
<p>Washington, 17th (International News Agency) - Diplomatic circles here officially announced today that Germany has concentrated two million soldiers, along with thousands of warplanes as support, and can launch an offensive against the Soviet border from Romania within a few hours upon receiving orders. Diplomatic circles said that Germany's sudden concentration of its troops on the Soviet border foreshadows three possible developments. The first is to implement a blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union to seize Ukraine's grain-producing areas and the Caucasus's oil, and then overthrow the Stalin regime and replace it with a Nazi puppet government, whose head would be a White Russian leader. The second is for Stalin to submit to Nazi demands and expand German-Soviet cooperation. But if this were to happen, the Soviet Union would inevitably dedicate its wheat and oil to the Nazis, and allow German troops to pass through Ukraine and the Black Sea to Iraq. The third is a feint to divert people's attention and immediately invade Britain. Diplomatic circles also revealed that, according to recent European news, Führer Hitler is determined to eliminate communism in the near future for various military and political reasons, so German military action against the Soviet Union seems inevitable. It is generally believed that even if the German invasion of the Soviet Union fails, the acquisition of Ukraine will satisfy it, as Germany can then attack the oil fields of the Near East.</p>
<p>Soviet Military Exercises: No Signs of Mobilization</p>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Reuters) - A dispatch from Moscow stated that infantry, artillery, tanks, and motorized vehicles of the Moscow Military District of the Soviet Union are currently holding exercises. General Durnev, in his speech at the opening of a certain military camp, briefly stated that it is imperative to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Soviet army without delay.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - Swiss radio reported that youth groups in Moscow and other places held a large parade yesterday, with the slogan "We are ready to defend our motherland."</p>
<p>Moscow, 17th (Reuters) - News of the Soviet Union's mobilization reported by foreign sources has not been confirmed here. According to the official Soviet announcement published on Friday, it is true that reserve training and annual summer exercises are being carried out. This matter naturally requires many people in a large and populous country like the Soviet Union, but the streets of Moscow are still as crowded as usual. Large-scale civil defense and similar organizational methods seem to be based solely on a long-term understanding of the international situation, and not on any current crisis, as there are no signs of this in Moscow.</p>

<p>Tokyo - A government spokesperson announced today that after American Ambassador to Japan Grew submitted a protest to the Japanese government yesterday regarding the damage to the office of the American Embassy's military attaché and American property during the Japanese plane bombing of Chongqing on Sunday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is currently investigating the case. The American Ambassador visited the Foreign Ministry on Saturday, also to discuss the bombing of Chongqing, but the spokesperson did not have accurate information about this trip, and said that the loss of foreign property during the bombing was an accidental event.

<h3 id="e26">Amendments to the Land Regulations By-laws Approved by Representatives of the Signing Countries; Must Not Conflict with the Land Regulations Themselves; The Shanghai Municipal Council’s Authority to Levy Taxes Is Therefore Expanded <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>According to an announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council, with regard to the proposed new by-laws 43 to 52 of the Land Regulations and the amendments to articles 30 and 34 of the existing by-laws, as stated in the Council Gazette of March 31, and resolved by the special meeting of foreign ratepayers held on April 17, the Consul-General Hill has notified by letter that the case has been approved by the consuls and diplomatic representatives of the signing countries.</p>
<p>Analysis of Land Regulations Clauses</p>
<p>The amendment and addition of by-laws to the Land Regulations are fundamentally different from the amendment of the Land Regulations themselves. The amendment of the Land Regulations themselves, according to the provisions of section 28 of the Regulations, "shall be decided by the consuls of the various countries in consultation with the local Chinese officials, but shall still be subject to the approval of the foreign ministers and the highest Chinese government." Therefore, if the organization of the provisional board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has not been approved by the Chinese government, it is naturally illegal. However, the amendment of the by-laws, according to the provisions of section 11 of the Land Regulations, "the council has the right to make further by-laws at any time, and may cancel, change or amend the by-laws, but shall be subject to the approval of the consuls and ministers of the various countries concerned, or the majority thereof, and shall be implemented after being passed by a special meeting of foreign ratepayers." However, according to the same article, "these further by-laws shall not conflict with the clauses of the Land Regulations." Therefore, if the amended or added by-laws are inconsistent with the Land Regulations, even if the council has the power to do so, it is still illegal. As for whether it must be approved by the Chinese government, it is irrelevant to the amendment or addition of the by-laws.</p>
<p>Outline of New By-laws Clauses</p>
<p>As for the original Land Regulations by-laws, there are a total of 42 articles, which are related to drainage management, building construction, road management, garbage disposal, business licenses, traffic regulations, temporary detainees, and penalties for disobeying consular orders. The newly added by-laws are ten articles, from 43 to 52. Article 43, registration of physicians; Article 44, reporting of infectious diseases; Article 45, isolation of infectious diseases; Article 46, penalties for infectious patients exposing themselves without authorization; Article 47, vaccination; Article 48, death registration; Article 49, penalties for overcrowding of houses; Article 50, housing inspection; Article 51, prohibition of spitting at will; Article 52 is one of the most important articles, divided into three sections. The first section is the valuation of land, houses, rents, and goods. The second section is the organization of the valuation committee. The third section is the expansion of the authority of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which states, "If the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Council or the appeals committee becomes the final decision and has legal effect, the Shanghai Municipal Council may implement this decision and levy taxes in accordance with articles 10 and 20 of the Land Regulations."</p>

<p>According to reports from American banking circles in Shanghai yesterday, the US government's decision to freeze German and Italian funds in the US will not have a serious impact on Shanghai. A senior official of an American bank also told reporters that they have not yet received any instructions from their head office regarding the freezing of Axis funds, so German and Italian residents in Shanghai can still withdraw funds as usual without any obstacles. They believe that Shanghai is an international city, so all American commercial banks will take this environment into consideration when handling all affairs and cannot be compared with banks in American colonies. However, European refugees in Shanghai have expressed considerable concern about the US freezing of German and Italian funds. However, there have been no major changes in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Akagi, Japanese Deputy Police Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Assassinated, Shot Three Times and Died Before Being Treated, Two Suspects Were Handed Over to the Japanese in Hongkou <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, a shooting assassination occurred on Difeng Road in the Shanghai Western Extension Road Area. The victim was Akagi Chikayuki, the current Japanese Deputy Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, who was shot three times. He died before being treated due to injuries to vital areas. The gunman escaped without a trace. Two suspects were arrested. The details of what was learned are recorded below.</p>
<p>Intercepted and Bombarded with More Than Ten Shots</p>
<p>Akagi Chikayuki, the current Special Deputy Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Security Department, resides at 827 Yu Garden Road. At about 9:30 a.m. yesterday, he walked out of his residence and boarded his own car with Shanghai Municipal Council pass number 4064 to go to the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Security Department on Fuzhou Road to work. Unexpectedly, when the car passed Difeng Road Difengli, four young men suddenly rushed out from the roadside, intercepted the car's progress, pulled out pistols, and bombarded the car, firing fifteen or sixteen shots. The bullets were as dense as a string of pearls. Pedestrians fled in all directions.</p>
<p>Shot Three Times, Blood Flowed Like a Stream</p>
<p>At that time, the car glass shattered into pieces. Akagi, in the car, was suddenly caught in this disaster and had nowhere to hide. He was shot three times, once in the head and lower jaw, once in the left waist of the abdomen, and once in the left leg. The bullet in the abdomen did not penetrate. He fell into the car compartment, blood flowing like a stream, barely breathing. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the gunman left with his weapon and disappeared without a trace. At that time, Special Police Superintendent Sherlock happened to be passing nearby and captured a suspect, finding a pistol on his person. At the same time, another special police officer heard the sound and rushed to the scene, also arresting a suspect.</p>
<p>Injuries to Vital Areas, Died of Suffocation</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the Japanese Military Police Unit in Western Shanghai, and the Special Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene of the incident to investigate and imposed temporary martial law in the vicinity to conduct a search. As a result, nothing was gained except for two suspects who were taken to Hongkou by the Japanese. Meanwhile, the injured Akagi was quickly accompanied by his driver to Hong En Hospital on Da Xi Road for treatment. After three foreign doctors from the hospital, including Dr. Connaught, performed surgery and blood transfusions, he died before being treated due to injuries to vital areas after 25 minutes. The temporary martial law at the scene of the incident was lifted at around 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Experienced in Police Affairs, Worked in Government Agencies</p>
<p>Akagi Chikayuki was 44 years old, born in May 1897 in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. In 1912, at the age of 18, he graduated from the former Tokyo Imperial University and served in police agencies in Japan. Ten years ago, he came to Shanghai and worked at the Japanese Consulate. On May 20, 1938, at the request of the Japanese side, he was appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Security Department as the Special Deputy Chief of the Police Department, whose power was second only to Police Chief Major Bavin and higher than other Deputy Police Chiefs.</p>
<p>Official Announcement from the Municipal Council Expresses Sorrow</p>
<p>According to an announcement from the Municipal Council, Mr. Akagi, the Japanese Special Deputy Chief of the Police Department, unfortunately died yesterday (the 17th). Upon receiving the report, the Council deeply mourns his loss. At that time, in addition to flying the flag at half-mast at the Council Building and the Police Department to express condolences, we also expressed our condolences to his family and others. At the same time, Council Chairman Liddell sent a letter to the Japanese Consul-General expressing his condolences.</p>
<p>Speculation on Cause of Death in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>According to news from the English Great Beauty Evening News, Akagi was in charge of cracking down on communist affairs in the Police Department, especially Japanese Communist Party members who came to Shanghai from Japan. Akagi's death came shortly after a time bomb exploded last week in the French Concession residence of Mr. Hanaoka Yuotaro (President of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha in Shanghai), a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Some people believe that the assassination of Akagi and the attempted murder of Hanaoka were orchestrated by "patriotic Japanese groups" in Shanghai, who oppose Akagi and Hanaoka's friendly treatment of people from other countries. Police Chief Major Bavin replied to questions about the assassination, saying, "We are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of a colleague. Akagi was a man of extraordinary personality and got along very well with everyone."</p>
<h3 id="e29">Coolidge Liner to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning,  Sails to San Francisco Awaiting Orders, New Liner Structure Novel and Adequate to the Mission <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>After the United States Maritime Commission implemented escort duties to aid Britain in the Atlantic, it decided to requisition four liners from the American President Lines operating on the Pacific Far East route, including three new World-class passenger ships, with tonnage exceeding 110,000 tons. To compensate for the requisition of seven ships, the company additionally dispatched ten President liners.</p>
<p>Sailing to Report to the US</p>
<p>The President Coolidge, listed in the requisition list, weighs over 21,200 tons and is one of the largest passenger ships sailing the Pacific. The ship is scheduled to arrive here at 7:30 AM this Thursday, returning from Manila and Hong Kong, carrying not only a large amount of cargo to be unloaded in Shanghai but also a large amount of mail from Manila, Hong Kong, and various parts of South China destined for Shanghai. The ship will dock at buoys No. 11 and 12, and the company's passenger launch is expected to arrive at the Customs Wharf at 9:15 AM that morning. The ship is scheduled to berth for one night and then set sail for the US the next morning at 5:00 AM, via the Xiangshan Channel to San Francisco, expected to arrive in Honolulu on the 29th of this month and in San Francisco on July 5th. According to the planned voyage, there is a one-day delay, but the original planned stops at Kobe and Yokohama in Japan have been canceled in order to arrive in the US as soon as possible to report for duty.</p>
<p>New Liner Structure</p>
<p>Among the President liners to be transferred to Shanghai are the President Van Buren, President Burke, and President Garfield, which are newly added to the fleet. These three ships were recently completed by the President Lines this year. It is reported that these ships each weigh 16,900 tons, with a net weight of 9,400 tons, equipped with 64,000 square feet of refrigerated space and twenty cranes on deck, including two sets of combined cranes, one at the bow and one at the stern, with four pairs of booms attached, each boom being 75 feet long and capable of lifting several tons of cargo. The deck is thick and wide, the structure is tall and broad, and the design is novel, surpassing the Bias, Lever, and Taho three ships. The above three ships were newly built by the US Maritime Commission and are three of the sister ships of the President Monroe, Adams, Jackson, and Hayes.</p>

<p>In view of the frequent appearance of thugs in the area bordering the Western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Roads, the Concession authorities recently reinforced defensive barriers at three locations: the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, the intersection of Haig Road and Great Western Road, and the intersection of Rue Robert and Hart Road. Sandbags as high as the shoulder were built. It is reported that this area is the US military defense zone, so the US military also sent soldiers to assist in the construction. According to residents near the area, 平明社 reporters said that during the day, US soldiers, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and police inspectors patrolled back and forth, checking entry and exit. From 11:00 PM to the next morning, US defense forces guarded inside the sandbags, so the area has become safer in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Sentence for Selling Rice with Short Weight, Not Allowed to Pay Fine Instead, Next Batch of Affordable Rice is of Better Quality and Slightly Increased Wholesale Price, Current Retail Price Still at 110 Yuan per Stone, Rice Shops Sell Rice with Different Weights Than Affordable Rice <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>According to the Police Department, on the morning of the 16th of this month, a Chinese woman went to Yongyu Rice Shop (registered number 三二二) at 86 Haining Road to buy one dou of rice, costing 10.08 yuan in national currency. Sergeant Zhang Hexiang happened to pass by the shop and, after noticing it, re-weighed the rice in the shop and found that it was only 15 jin (one jin short). He immediately arrested the shop assistant Zhang Zhihua. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zhihua was brought to court and sentenced to four months of imprisonment without the option of paying a fine instead.</p>
<p>70,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council started selling affordable foreign rice, the common people have benefited. Foreign rice from Vietnam, Burma, and Java, purchased by the Municipal Council, continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Sun Rising arrived at noon, carrying a large shipment of foreign rice from Rangoon, totaling 19,994 bags, berthed at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading. The rice was purchased by the Far East Trading Company. In addition, the American ship Florence, managed by Wah Lun Trading Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening, also carrying a large quantity of foreign rice from Rangoon, amounting to 40,000 bags, berthed at the Pudong Longmao Wharf for unloading. There are still large quantities of rice on the way to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wholesale Price of Foreign Rice to be Increased</p>
<p>During a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Committee on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, in addition to discussing the transportation of the Municipal Council's foreign rice, it was decided that once the 285,000 bags of small milled rice purchased from Hong Kong have been completely sold, the wholesale price of foreign rice sold thereafter will be increased by about four yuan per bag. It is reported that the reasons for the increase are: (1) the quality of the rice is better than that previously ordered; (2) the cost of transporting rice from Rangoon to Hong Kong has now increased. The increased prices are described as follows: (1) Small milled rice sold by the Municipal Council to miscellaneous grain stores will increase from 124.7 yuan to 128.76 yuan. The price of each bag sold by miscellaneous grain stores to rice shops or directly by the Municipal Council to rice shops will increase from the original price of 133.5 yuan to 137 yuan. (2) Min Dang rice sold by the Municipal Council to miscellaneous grain stores will increase from 127.2 yuan to 131.26 yuan. The price of each bag sold by the Municipal Council directly to rice shops or by miscellaneous grain stores to rice shops will increase from 136.3 yuan to 139.5 yuan. The implementation is scheduled for around the 10th of next month.</p>
<p>Current Retail Price Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The above-mentioned increase in the ordering price will only be implemented when the total of more than 280,000 bags of affordable foreign rice that have already arrived in Shanghai and will be transported to Shanghai before the end of this month have been completely sold. The exact retail price per stone at the time of the second batch of foreign rice arriving next month will be announced separately by the Municipal Council, and the rice shops will also display new price tags. Therefore, the current price of small milled rice from the Municipal Council sold at the shops is still 110 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Reasons for Different Weights of Rice</p>
<p>An Important Announcement from the Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association states that since January of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the rice industry in this city has switched to using new measuring instruments, stipulating that the weight of each stone shall be standardized at 156 jin of net rice using the new municipal scale. This was previously reported to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau for approval and incorporated into Article 9 of the Association's charter, which has been implemented for many years. Recently, due to soaring rice prices, the Concession authorities have ordered rice from the Hong Kong government and other sources to be transported to Shanghai for relief. Its weight is set at 160 municipal jin per stone, which is different from the previous regulations. However, this resolution shows the sincerity of the Concession authorities, and members of the Association should regard it as a special case and not adhere to the previous regulations. When selling at retail, the rice transported by the Concession authorities for relief (Municipal Council's foreign rice) should be sold according to the original 160 municipal jin of net rice per stone from the foreign firms, to fulfill the responsibility of assisting. As for the rice purchased by the other shops themselves, it should still be sold according to the approved weight of 156 municipal jin of net rice per stone, to comply with the original plan.</p>

<p>The relationship between China and the Dutch East Indies has a long history. There are over 1.2 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Currently, the two countries are making efforts to improve trade, and the Dutch East Indies People's Council will submit the matter for discussion. At a time when Japanese-Dutch economic negotiations have broken down, it has attracted attention from people in various Allied nations. The following information was gathered by a reporter from the New Life News Agency from the Inspector General of Customs:</p>
<p>Sino-Dutch Trade</p>
<p>From January to April of the 30th year of the Republic, imports were valued at 43.802 million yuan in national currency, and exports were valued at 29.843 million yuan in national currency. In the 29th year of the Republic, imports were valued at 10.7504 million yuan in national currency, and exports were valued at 48.521 million yuan in national currency. In the 28th year of the Republic, imports were valued at 58.35 million yuan in national currency, and exports were valued at 17.688 million yuan in national currency. In the 27th year of the Republic, imports were valued at 45.744 million yuan in national currency, and exports were valued at 6.664 million yuan in national currency. In the 26th year of the Republic, imports were valued at 80.718 million yuan in national currency, and exports were valued at 6.228 million yuan in national currency. The above data proves that trade between China and the Dutch East Indies has rapidly progressed, with a significant increase in the import of Chinese native products into the Dutch East Indies.</p>

<p>Regarding the list of native products exempt from transit tax, the Ministry of Finance had previously issued a public notice. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has now issued another order to the customs offices in various regions, approving the addition of the various native products listed in the attached table to the previously ordered list of native products exempt from transit tax, and uniformly exempting them from transit tax, effective from May of this year. The list of items listed in the attached table is copied below: (1) Live animals; (2) Thawed meat (including poultry and game); (甲) Processed meat; (乙) Others; (4) Medicines and pills, powders, and ointments; (5) Unlisted vegetable oils; (6) Cotton seeds; (7) Hemp seeds; (8) Rapeseeds; (9) Fermented bean curd; (10) Clothing and clothing parts; (10)(1) Porcelain.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the Shanghai Municipal Council employees requesting another salary increase, it was previously submitted to the Municipal Council meeting for discussion, and it was resolved to refer it to the Personnel Committee for review. This is because the current budget of the Council is significantly insufficient, and considerable consideration must be given to this issue. The Personnel Committee then convened another meeting at 4:30 PM on the 16th in the Municipal Council meeting room. The committee members present all agreed that since the Council employees requested a salary increase last November, prices in the city have continued to rise, which is a proven fact. Therefore, the treatment of low-level employees should be improved. However, since the price difference between last November and the present ranges from 30% to 40%, it was believed that a special committee should first conduct a special investigation on the price index and then determine the rate of salary increase based on the prices. As for the financial resources after the salary increase, the Finance Committee will be consulted for discussion.</p>

<p>The manager of the Soviet Merchant Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Su Laiveishu, firmly denied on the 16th that the bureau would be sending seven new Soviet ships to sail to the Far East. He said, "This statement is inaccurate and has no basis." However, Mr. Su confirmed that about four existing Soviet ships are being repaired at shipyards in this city.

<h3 id="e38">Lewd Song and Dance Performances, Police Strictly Prohibit, Female Performers Forgiven Due to Their Base Profession, Theater Owners Should Be Arrested and Severely Punished <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Social order is unstable after the war, and incidents that offend public morals are constantly emerging. A group of shameless people initially organized a song and dance troupe in Western Shanghai. Although the performance is ostensibly a song and dance, what is actually performed is all girls'</p>
<p>Naked Dancing</p>
<p>Completely naked, attracting crowds of lecherous individuals. However, Western Shanghai is inconvenient for transportation.  Therefore, they do not hesitate to violate laws and disciplines and move to the Concessions. The theaters of this kind of obscene performance have been increasing in the Concessions. At first, they were slightly covered up, but now they are completely naked. The Public Concession Police Authority recently received</p>
<p>Confidential Letters</p>
<p>Ordering the investigation by Sergeant Fangteer of the Zhabei Police Station and Chinese Sergeant Ji Cunyi. The Chinese and Western Sergeants were ordered to investigate the Xinle Palace Theater attached to the Xinlv Hotel at the intersection of Hubei Road and Jiujiang Road. The Chinese detective wearing clothing numbered 835 was assigned to watch the show in the theater. The theater performs four shows every day, with a total of twelve programs. Among them, the performances of the fourth section, "Spring Army," and the twelfth section, "Diaoliu Shi," feature five female performers who come on stage without wearing anything.</p>
<p>Completely Naked</p>
<p>Seriously violating public morals. When Diaoliu Shi took the stage, the detective reported to the sergeant, who immediately went there. By then, the show had already ended. The sergeants rushed to the backstage and arrested the female performers Zhao Lihua (22 years old, from Suzhou), Chen Jinying (25 years old, from Ningbo), Yu Ajie (17 years old), Shen Abao (25 years old), and Xu Xingying (24 years old). The five women had not yet put on their clothes. The host, Zhu Wenhui, escaped. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Police Lawyer Peng Qiqi</p>
<p>Filed a charge of obstructing public morals, stating that Zhao had a daily wage of eight yuan, Chen and Yu had 3.8 yuan each, and Shen and Xu had three yuan each, requesting severe punishment to rectify public order and serve as a warning. The women confessed to the naked performance. After reviewing the confession, Judge Dai sentenced the five women, including Zhao Lihua, to 59 days of detention each as a warning.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no change in the HSBC listed rates, but the unofficial market for British and American currencies continued to weaken. The deteriorating US-German relations intensified the speculative intentions of Chinese merchants. The July British pound hardened to 3 pence and 34375, and the US dollar hardened to 5.46875 yuan for July as well. At noon, there was a slight rebound, making it difficult to buy and sell. In the afternoon, Chinese banks took less, but speculators continued to sell off, stabilizing the situation. The final British pound was 0.015625, at 3 pence 4375, and the US dollar was 0.03125, at 5.4375 yuan, and 5.46875 yuan for July. Overall trading was uneventful.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Very Lukewarm in Buying</p>
<p>Since the foreign telegrams showed that the silver markets in Britain and America were flat, and the Indian silver increased by 2 to 1 anna, the market situation was flat. There were no changes in the foreign exchange rates between Britain and America. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling price of the bank in the domestic market was 3 pence 328025 for the spot British pound, 5.40625 yuan for the US dollar, and 5.4375 yuan for July. The Russian ruble hardened, and forward rates could also be settled at the above prices. However, speculators remained cautious and did not dare to act rashly. The HSBC listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was still slightly at 23.75%. Negative rumors were rampant, and the British pound weakened. Chinese merchants rushed to sell the July US dollar at 5.46875 yuan, and it was difficult to sell or settle at the most relaxed price. The purchase appetite of various foreign banks was very lukewarm. The noon closing price of the British pound was 3 pence 1328125, 3 pence 4375 for July, and 5.4375 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>Finally, Britain and America Unanimously Lengthen</p>
<p>In the afternoon, speculators sold less of the July 5 yuan 46875, and a few were absorbed by Chinese banks. Afterwards, it was not easy to continue selling. The market situation went from tight to hard again. At the 3:30 PM closing, the spot British pound to July hardened to 3 pence 1475, the US dollar spot and June 5.4375 yuan, and 5.46875 yuan for July, were higher than the closing price of the previous day, with the British pound increasing by 0.015625, and increasing by 0.03125.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Exchange Dealers Cover In, Gold Market's Decline Moderates, Spot Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was volatile and bearish sentiment persisted, but there was a slight pause. This was because, amidst rumors of negative news, the exchange rate showed little downward pressure, and exchange dealers and speculators frequently covered their positions. Most people still anticipated a downward trend. After opening in the morning, news spread that the U.S. was withdrawing its ambassador to Germany, followed by rumors that the U.S. was closing the German embassy and the Hai Tong News Agency. The exchange rate between the British pound and U.S. dollar weakened. Tian Yuan, Ding Sheng, Yi Da, and Cheng Ji successively sold off, and the price fell below 6,269 yuan. At noon, the decline was temporarily halted by the absorption of the *bang* (local Shanghai syndicate), but selling pressure resumed in the afternoon, causing the price to fall to a low of 6,318 yuan. Exchange dealers again covered their positions, while Shun Yuan and retail investors absorbed the supply, pushing the price up by twenty *yang* (a small denomination) before the market closed, with a final gain of twenty-six *yang*. The total volume of transactions for the day was forty-five thousand taels. In swap trading (June rolling into July), the seller Tian Yuan offered a premium of fifty taels to the buyer Xiang Xing Yong, and the price rose to fifty-five yuan. Cash prices rose further. Shi Xiang advanced to buy from De Fu, and He Sheng sold to Xiang He each for one hundred taels, with the price at 370 *qian* (even smaller denomination) higher than the forward price. There were no transactions reported in the afternoon, but sellers were still offering at 370 yuan above the spot price, a slight decrease from the previous day. Prices for gold ornaments and customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Futures Fall Twenty-Six Yuan</p>
<p>The morning session opened at 9:15 AM at 6,355 yuan per bar (ten taels), down sixteen yuan. Under varying supply and demand pressures, the price rose to 6,360 yuan and then retreated to 6,355 yuan. Tong Kang Yong, Yi Yuan, and De Cheng aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 6,369 yuan. Later, Tian Yuan, Cheng Ji, Yi Ren, Da Feng, He Sheng, and Xin Feng Yong successively sold, and news of deteriorating U.S.-German relations further weakened the market, causing the price to fall to 6,347 yuan. Jing Dan Ji and Yi Yuan bought, raising the price to 6,355 yuan. The noon session closed at 6,350 yuan. After the noon session, Shi He, Cheng Ji, and Xin Feng Yong aggressively sold, causing the price to drop further to a low of 6,338 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 1:00 PM at 6,335 yuan, down fifteen yuan from the noon close. After a slight rise to 6,342 yuan, Heng Ji and De Xue sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 6,328 yuan. Da Feng, Yi Yuan, Shun Yuan, and retail investors stepped in to absorb the supply, causing the price to quickly rise to 6,348 yuan. Soon after, sellers pushed the price down again to 6,340 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,345 yuan, down twenty-six yuan from the previous day's close. The settlement price for the July U.S. dollar was 5.46875, resulting in a gold price of 6,368 yuan, a decrease of thirteen yuan. The market was flat after closing. The range for the day was forty-one yuan. The cash price for local brand gold was 380 yuan higher than the volatile futures price for sales and 70 yuan lower for purchases. There was no market or price for current standard gold.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Remain Small <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was weak, with the British pound and U.S. dollar each falling by one yuan. The buying and selling rates for British gold remained stable, and the market price remained flat. The U.S. dollar traded at a tariff of three *jiao* (a smaller denomination), retreated to two *jiao* after opening, and closed at two *jiao* three *fen* (an even smaller denomination) at noon. It had previously retreated to one *jiao* seven *fen* in the afternoon and closed at 18 yuan, two *jiao*, three *fen*, a drop of six *fen* from the previous day. The trend for Hong Kong dollars was stable, and the market price remained flat. The Japanese yen and Korean won both weakened, with the former falling to one yuan, nine *jiao*, and the latter falling to one yuan, six *jiao*, one *fen*.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Securities: Future of Unified Type A Bonds Looks Promising, Significant Fluctuations in Public Motor Vehicle Shares <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Trading in the morning was still a consolidation, and then tended upwards again in the afternoon. With large investors and financial institutions buying, Type C bonds ultimately broke through the 70 yuan mark, and the trend is still moving towards a peak. Yesterday morning, Xin Fu and He bought, while Hong Tai, Xiang Yu, Xing Yi, and Tai sold. Only Type A bonds slightly declined, while the rest were slightly better by one or two *jiao*. In the afternoon, Xin Fu continued to buy, and No. 41 Ji Ji still had demand. Xin Hua and Yi Chang both absorbed, and Hong Tai Xiang continued to sell. Yi Zhong and general retail investors also supplied a significant amount. As a result, there were no changes in Type A, D, and C bonds, while other types increased by 3.5 to 5.5 *jiao*. Currently, Type A bonds are the cheapest. It is expected that Type A bonds will soon diverge, as the difference between them and domestic bonds is only 8.5 yuan, compared to the usual 10 yuan difference. Now they are 1.45 yuan cheaper, and the lottery draw for the twelfth issue is scheduled for August 10th, so the future looks promising. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Guan Sheng Country Stocks led trading with ten shares, priced at 70 yuan. The public exchange remained stable throughout the day, with prices fluctuating within a very narrow range. Only Public Motor Vehicle shares saw significant fluctuations, with over 8,000 shares traded. The price gradually rose from 15 yuan, 3 *jiao*, to 17 yuan, 1 *jiao*, but then fell back to 16 yuan, 3 *jiao* at the close. Rubber stocks remained scarce, with a soft underlying trend.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Monday) Telegram: Today, the quoted prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks remained flat, with no changes in market conditions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be lackluster. The association's opening price for Dutch No. 24 grade refined white sugar was 89 to 90 yuan for new goods ex-godown, 87.5 to 87.8 yuan for March arrivals, and 88 yuan for April arrivals, and 88.5 yuan for May arrivals. Dutch raw red sugar was 70 yuan, 7 *jiao* for new goods and 69 yuan, a slight increase of 5 *jiao*, for old goods. Tai Gu refined white B-mark suddenly dropped by three yuan to 105 yuan due to more sellers. Lower-grade sugars remained stable, with DY-mark at 94 yuan and HX-mark at 88 yuan, maintaining their original prices.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Grain Market: Speculators Active Again, Rice Prices Continue to Rise, 70,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Yesterday <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market saw another day of consolidation yesterday. However, with persistent buying interest and active speculation, market prices were modestly raised by one or two yuan. Broken rice and small grain rice from Ningbo, the inland countryside, and various local households were dragged in, and the trend looks promising. As soon as the market opened in the morning, it was pushed higher by speculators, and the current price for various goods rose by more than one or two yuan. Then, with high prices, speculators started to sell off, and buyers waited to observe the high prices. Chinese and foreign merchants were actively selling, and other than direct transactions and undisclosed deals, only Chinese merchants threw off 500 tons of Siam late No. 2 rice loading at the end of the month, priced at 129 yuan. As a result, the noon market fell back by nearly one yuan. Then, market speculators became active again, and the evening close rose by nearly one yuan. Anglo-Chinese Company (one *shi* (unit of measure) two and a half *dou*) small grain rice ex-godown was priced from 139 to 140 yuan, and there were further calls for higher prices. Broken rice opened at 107 to 107.5 yuan, and there were also calls for 108 to 109 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was priced at 136 to 137 yuan. The total transaction volume was 1,700 to 1,800 tons of Anglo-Chinese Company original bags, and 17,000 bags ex-godown. Saigon No. 1 was priced at up to 120 yuan, No. 2 at 114 yuan, Annam glutinous rice at 122 yuan, Gao Min Tang at 120 yuan, small grain rice at 115.5 yuan, Thailand No. 1 at 117 yuan, and No. 2 at 112 yuan.</p>
<p>A large quantity of Burmese foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson's Rising Sun arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying 29,994 bags directly from Yangon, berthed at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hong Kou for unloading. This foreign rice was procured by Far Easterns Trading and financed by the Overseas Chinese Bank. The Florence D., managed by Wah Chang Yuen, also arrived from Yangon with a large quantity of 40,000 bags of foreign rice. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th of this month, it actually arrived last night and berthed at the Long Mao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. This foreign rice was procured by the Daifu Trading Company.</p>
<p>After two days of declines, thick and thin domestic rice saw local shops and customers buy up bargain quantities when foreign rice turned tight. As a result the sellers' confidence strengthened and they struggled to push up prices, so prices eventually rebounded by a yuan or so. Early and late Southern Port rice were priced at 132 yuan for fresh rice, 130 yuan for second-grade rice, 127-128 yuan for old rice, and 130 yuan for original bags of old rice. Wuxi original bags of old glutinous rice opened high at 124 yuan, then retreated to 121 yuan for second-grade rice.</p>
<p>With other goods trending upward, glutinous rice prices and sentiment are also good, and the market is unanimously tight. Hong Kong round-grain rice opened at 115.5 yuan, high grade at 113-114 yuan, medium grade at 111-112 yuan. High-grade glutinous *lu* (variety) opened at 107 yuan, retreated to 104 yuan. Domestic *yuan* (variety) rice is difficult to push upwards only due to the weather situation, and is showing only flat prices. Higher-grade rice opened at 122-120 yuan, and *jue* (variety) rice at 116-117 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Flour Turns Sharply Higher <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The foreign flour market suddenly turned bullish. With the activity of transport to customers in the interior continuing, sentiment has gradually improved. New wheat from the interior cannot be easily transported, and the supply of foreign flour is expected to be interrupted, with rumors of disruptions en route. Therefore, local speculators rushed to buy up stocks, and suppliers took the opportunity to push up prices, causing the market to turn sharply higher. Gold Dragon flour opened high at 30 yuan, 3.4 *jiao*, and then rose to 6 or 7 *jiao*. Fortress flour jumped to 31 yuan, 3.4 to 6 *jiao*. Flower Bird Mining Building brand was priced at 32 to 32.5 yuan, up about one yuan from the previous day. However, some retail sellers emerged in the evening market, and Gold Dragon flour closed at 30 yuan, 3 *jiao*. There were also transactions for Treasure Box brand at 30 yuan, 7 *jiao*, and Five Swallow brand at 32 yuan, 3 *jiao*. Total transactions for all goods were about 30,000 bags.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains stalled, as new wheat from the interior has not yet formally arrived in Shanghai. Goods jointly operated by Japanese flour manufacturers are also in transit. According to industry discussions, this year's wheat harvest is worse than in previous years, and government control is even stricter, so it is not easy for Japanese merchants to procure wheat. Therefore, the future of the wheat market looks dim.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Yarn and Cotton: Weakening Sales of Double Horse Yarn, Yarn Prices Decline, But Factory Orders Remain Tight, Shorts Still Selling <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had seen a large increase the previous day, declined yesterday. This was because gains of over 50 yuan in one day led to profit-taking, while the decline in benchmark gold prices weighed on sentiment and loosened market conditions. However, factory orders remained tight, and shorts still paid premiums of 2.5 to 5 *jiao* to roll over their positions, so the bulls remained calm. However, the shorts continued to dump stock on fears of major changes in the international situation, and were unwilling to cover their positions. As a result, bulls and bears were again in a stalemate. Demand from the Cantonese community for Double Horse brand yarn was not as strong as the previous day. The high price for 20-count Double Yarn was 1,507 yuan, and the low price was 1,487 yuan. The first transaction in the afternoon was at 1,484 yuan, rising to 1,494 yuan, and the final price was 1,490 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning session for Double Horse yarn opened with a peaceful atmosphere. With profit-taking from the previous day, the situation was weakening. The opening price was 1,495 yuan. As soon as this price opened, sellers flocked, and the price soon rose to 1,507 yuan. Later, news of deteriorating U.S.-German relations caused the shorts to become active again, and the price declined, falling to 1,497 yuan. With covering and buying remaining active, the price rose again by 5 yuan or more. Ultimately, with the softening of benchmark gold prices, the closing price was 1,487 yuan. The total transaction volume for the half-day was 7,205 bales, including 805 bales purchased by the Hong Kong community and 6,200 bales purchased by local merchants.</p>
<p>The market situation for Double Horse standard yarn was flat and weak. As a result, the July contract fell by 8 yuan and the August contract fell by 7 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,600 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>|           | Morning Session | Afternoon Session |</p>
<p>| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |</p>
<p>| July Open | 1392            | 1390             |</p>
<p>| Close     | 1393            | 1390             |</p>
<p>| Daily High| 1400 Low 1388   |                  |</p>
<p>| August Open| 1406           | 1379            |</p>
<p>| Close     | 1401             | 1400             |</p>
<p>| Daily High| 1409.5 Low 1397  |                  |</p>

<p>The current cotton situation remains as firm as ever. Under the impetus of frequent rises in foreign cotton, fine lint cotton has become the target of public criticism, so the market price only rises and never falls. The price of 20-count raw materials is gradually advancing towards a high peak.</p>
<p>White Luo Qu 280, Shen Xin No. 9 Factory, 300 bales delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Luo Mi De Lin 420 also, 300 bales, also</p>
<p>Du Li La 290, Shen Xin No. 2 Factory, 200 bales, also</p>

<p>Also 192, also 300 bales, also</p>
<p>Also 193, also 120 bales, also</p>
<p>Also, foreign cotton trading in the port continued the previous day's upward trend. Sentiment was excited, and the market was lively. Midlin and Brazilian cotton were particularly popular, and Chinese and foreign merchants, various cotton mills, and various cotton dealers were all buying large quantities. It is expected that with the yarn market doing well and overseas procurement becoming increasingly difficult, the cotton market will see even more enthusiastic development.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was lively and firm, rising steadily due to enthusiastic buying by traders and favorable weather reports. As a result, closing prices were higher than the previous day, with the spot price rising by 33 points and the other contracts rising by 12 to 13 points.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Face Difficult Sales, Factory Cloth Transactions Are Also Light <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was slightly weaker. With continuous price increases in recent days, local shops gradually absorbed the supply, but with yarn prices softening, they adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Demand from the Southeast Asian community was also temporarily light due to the easing of exchange rates. However, procurement from the Cantonese and Hong Kong communities remained active, and the selling pressure in the overall market did not ease. Prices for some white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 1 to 2.5 *jiao*. Fine Rich cloth opened at 43 yuan, 5 *jiao*, and was sold at one *jiao* higher in the afternoon. Prices for bleached, dyed, and printed cloth were flat. The local market transacted in just over 100 bales of various cloths, while the Cantonese and Hong Kong community handled over 300 bales of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning market was flat, and the afternoon market declined. With difficult sales, dyed fine cloth sales to the north were sluggish, falling 2.5 *jiao* per bolt. The closing price for Long Tou warehouse receipts in the afternoon was 44 yuan, 8 *jiao*, down one *jiao*. Lower-grade fine twill, such as Baby Double Fish, saw significant procurement from local merchants, and prices rose. Transactions in the market were still led by Calling Gentleman Serge, opening at 1 yuan, 5 *jiao*, 0.25 *li* (even smaller denomination), rising to 1 yuan, 5 *jiao*, 0.075 *li*, but declining step by step after a short time, closing at 1 yuan, 4 *jiao*, 9.25 *fen* at noon. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the market price in the British Concession continued to soften, weakening the situation. However, existing warehouse receipts remain tight, and the evening close was 1 yuan, 4 *jiao*, 8.875 *fen*.</p>

<p>Minpu Fish: This year's harvest is poor, only 20% of normal, so the first batch from Zhoushan opened at 400 yuan, then retreated to 330 yuan. However, with the poor harvest, price declines are difficult. Currently, merchants have raised prices again to 380 yuan. New goods from Ningbo have not yet arrived, and it is expected that the price of the first batch will be very high.</p>

<h3 id="e57">YMCA College Guidance Lectures, Day Two: Students from Soochow, Kwong Hua, and Fudan Universities Introduce Their Respective Schools <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The YMCA College Guidance Lectures continued yesterday with the second day. At 4 PM, at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, students from Soochow, Kwong Hua, and Fudan universities introduced their respective schools as follows:</p>
<p>Soochow University Overview</p>
<p>First, Ms. Hu Jingxian, a student from Soochow University, introduced the school, stating that after the war, the school had three locations: the College of Liberal Arts at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road, the College of Science and the College of Commerce at the Tzu Shu Building on Nanjing Road, and the Department of Music on the fifth floor of the Asian Literary Society on Museum Road. As for the school's atmosphere and characteristics, it is difficult to describe, but it can be said that students get along very well, like a large family. In addition, they are fond of extracurricular activities, which is a special characteristic. The school is organized into three colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, and Commerce. The College of Liberal Arts is divided into six departments: The Chinese Literature Department has professors such as Wang Zhixin, Zhu Weizhi, Zhu Rongquan, and Cai Shangsi. The Foreign Language Department has British teacher Mr. Carver, who teaches in a relaxed and satirical style, as well as Miss Byrd and Miss Colman. The former is very popular with students, as evidenced by the saying "Miss Byrd is like a bird." The latter likes to study journalism, and the school set up a journalism department for her. The Sociology Department is well-regarded in Shanghai, with professors such as Jin Wuzhou, Chen Shuying, and Zhang Chunfa. The Political Science Department has professors such as Yu Rixuan and Mr. Hansone, who emphasize self-study. The Education Department has a heavier workload, with professors such as Pr. Westbrook and Hu Zuti teaching piano, Chinese string music, and acoustics. The College of Science is divided into three departments: Biology, which has an attached medical program; Chemistry, headed by Dr. Tang Ningkang; and Physics, headed by Dr. Tu Yuqing, who is a talented musician and very popular with students. The Dean of the College of Commerce is Zheng Shicha, and the college is very well-regarded, with professors such as Li Yixiang. Regarding student life, extracurricular activities are very lively. Religious organizations include the Soochow University Christian Student Fellowship, which is divided into service, publishing, and entertainment groups. Volunteer schools are run during the summer. Academic organizations are also active in each college and department, such as the Soochow Literary Society. Regarding native-place organizations, there are the Guangdong Association and the Chaozhou Association. The entrance examination for freshmen includes a composition in Chinese (the topic is assigned, and either classical or vernacular Chinese is acceptable). There are many questions on Chinese studies common knowledge, such as who wrote a certain book. There are also fill-in-the-blank idioms and sentence construction, which are not too difficult. The English exam includes multiple choice, error correction, and silent reading. The science exam tests basic knowledge. The math exam for both the College of Commerce and the College of Liberal Arts is a mixture, mostly related to business topics such as simple and compound interest and direct and inverse proportions. It is best to pay attention to these topics. The application dates for freshmen are July 1-12 for the first round and August 11-16 for the second round. The entrance examinations are on July 15-16 for the first round and August 19-20 for the second round. Chinese and civics are tested on the first day from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and English is tested in the afternoon from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Science and history/geography are tested on the second day from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and mathematics is tested in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Kwong Hua University Overview</p>
<p>Next, Du Cheng, a student from Kwong Hua University, introduced the school, stating that most students come from the interior and have a frugal lifestyle. Furthermore, because the school emphasizes Chinese and the philosophy of Wang Yangming, there is a strong sense of revivalism. Therefore, the Chinese language level at Kwong Hua University is relatively high, which is a special characteristic. The school is organized into three colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, and Commerce. The College of Liberal Arts has the departments of Political Science, Sociology, History, Chinese, and Foreign Languages, with professors such as Lü Simian and Jiang Zhuzhuang. The College of Science has the departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, and the chemical equipment is quite complete. The College of Commerce has the departments of Economics, Accounting, Banking, and Business Administration. As for student life, the school's YMCA is very active. The Fujian Association and the Nan Feng Society (Guangdong Association) are native-place organizations. The Kwong Hua Drama Society of the YMCA is very large in scale, and many students participate. Tuition and fees are approximately 200 yuan per semester.</p>
<p>Fudan University Overview</p>
<p>Finally, Luo Guanzong, a student from Fudan University, introduced the school, stating that the school is organized into four colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce. The College of Liberal Arts has the departments of Chinese (with professors such as Zhao Jingshen, who are well-received), Foreign Languages (with professors such as Yao Ke, who teach drama courses), Education (with more female students), and Journalism (currently not enrolling students). The College of Science has the departments of Chemistry and Civil Engineering (which are well-regarded). The College of Commerce has the departments of Banking and Accounting (students in these two departments are very self-motivated). The College of Law has the departments of Sociology (students are able to conduct in-depth research in the community), Political Science (there are many students in this department, but some students study politics without reading the newspapers), and Economics (headed by Li Quanshi). Student extracurricular activities are very active. The Fudan Drama Society is very large in scale. Because the president emphasizes English, the English level at the school, although not very high, is not easy to pass. Some students have studied at the school for eight years and have not yet obtained a diploma because their English level is not sufficient. Some people say that the students at the school are good at "jumping" (referring to dancing), but only a few students are, and the vast majority of students are very frugal.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Today's schedule includes presentations by Xu Jinfu from Soochow University, Sun Jiafu from St. John's University, and Shen Renjing from Datong University, who will introduce their respective schools in detail. Although it rained yesterday, the audience was very enthusiastic. Today is sure to be very crowded.</p>

<p>(Dahua News Agency) The private New Universal No. 2 Elementary School on Chongqing Road in this city once experienced a teaching strike. Unexpectedly, another disturbance occurred on the 16th, resulting in an unfortunate incident of students fighting and injuring each other. After the school notified parents to let their children have early vacation, yesterday some parents and students planned to ask the principal for report cards, but were rejected by Feng Yuanchang, secretary of the principal's office, who closed the office door. Some middle school students forced elementary school teachers to disperse the students gathered outside the school gate. At 6:30 PM, a conflict suddenly broke out between school workers and teachers. According to Dahua News Agency reporters, teacher Yao Lin was injured in the waist and neck and was sent to Shilong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Yucai Refugee Children's School Prepares for Second Anniversary Celebration <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Xu Shiying, Vice Chairman of the National Relief Commission, Zhang Yilin, a member of the Senate, and others invited Ms. He Ailian, daughter of Sir Robert Hotung, and Tao Xingzhi, president of the Society for Life Education, in the winter of 1938 to initiate the establishment of refugee children's education. At the same time, they began to select talented refugee children from various provinces and cities. By June 1939, a total of 150 talented refugee children had been selected from 15 provinces and cities, with the youngest being eight years old and the oldest being fourteen years old. In July of that year, the school opened in Beibei, the wartime capital, and was named Yucai Refugee Children's School. The first step in its educational approach was to have psychology professors from various universities in the wartime capital administer precise psychological tests to each child to serve as a basis for teaching. The children were then divided into small groups based on their physiological state. In addition to receiving general knowledge and skills education in accordance with regulations, they were given special education based on their talents in eight groups: natural sciences, social sciences, crafts, agronomy, literature, music, painting, and drama. Over the past two years, the general education level has been equivalent to that of junior high school, and special education has progressed rapidly. This July, the school will hold a second anniversary celebration to exhibit the achievements of the past two years and launch a fundraising campaign for a 200,000 yuan fund and a movement to solicit 1,000 Friends of Yucai. It is reported that these measures have been carried out at home and abroad.</p>

The association will hold its first anniversary celebration at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association on the afternoon of the 21st of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Discussion on Tram Fare Increase <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>Tram fare increases are inevitable, but from the perspective of the citizens, there is an indescribable hardship, and even the little convenience of taking a tram is about to be taken away.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will still tirelessly put forward our requests and reasons, hoping that they can consider it again from the perspective of taking care of people's livelihood. After all, the proposal is not an unchangeable statue. In fact, even if it is made of iron, it can be melted and cast into another image. It is not impossible!</p>
<p>The company's reason is "a sharp decline in investment profit."</p>
<p>However, two points should be noted: "Increasing revenue" is a method, but "reducing expenditure" is also important. In particular, expenses are "huge", but in this "huge" expense, are there any "loopholes"? Are there unnecessary consumption?</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, the passengers are most familiar with it—giving money but not giving tickets is one type; giving him two coppers and paying for a one-cent or a few-cent ticket is another. Such "skimming oil" undoubtedly puts a huge discount on the company's income. As a result, the company has to "increase prices" again for "a sharp decline in investment profit"! And if this continues, "price increases" will never end.</p>
<p>However, doesn't the company have a large number of ticket inspectors? But ticket inspection has lost its effectiveness today. Aren't we often seeing news of ticket sellers "violently attacking" ticket inspectors? Because they are afraid of being beaten, and the company has no way to protect them, the ticket inspectors have to "turn a blind eye", and the "ticket inspection is useless" has a basis.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the tram, we can hear the roar of the ticket seller from time to time——"Hey, friend, my 'skimming oil' is not skimming from you, why do you care so much!" Some passengers believe it, and some don't, and they will be scolded. After paying the money, being skimmed off, and being scolded in return is really unreasonable. As a result, the company raised the tram fare in order to earn a "certain standard profit", and the unfortunate ones are the passengers again.</p>
<p>Here, we put forward specific methods, hoping that the company can adopt them:</p>
<p>First, maximize the power of passengers to supervise ticket sellers to implement the rule that "the tram fare paid must be equal to the value of the ticket", because only in this way can it replace the work of countless ticket inspectors, and the company's income, I firmly believe, will definitely increase by more than 40%.</p>
<p>Second, provide ticket inspectors with real protection to avoid unexpected disasters, to help the more sound development of the above-mentioned structure, and to make the "radio station" (i.e., ventilation and communication workers, such as the "No. 3 red-haired man" on the front station, etc., so that ticket sellers can rest assured that skimming oil can continue, and if there is danger, the "radio station" can "rescue") built everywhere by the ticket sellers lose its effect. This is also what the company must adjust.</p>
<p>Third, the company itself should lower the standard for earning money, because today's exchange rate has "different prices in the morning and evening markets", and the company's profit is also on the passengers' heads, so we hope that the company can abandon this standard if possible, or at least lower it, and determine the exchange rate from the "average number" first, so as not to raise prices temporarily.</p>
<p>The above is about the company's side, but the author is not the company's accomplice to strangle the ticket sellers. What is important here is to appeal for the vast majority of our passengers.</p>
<p>As for the ticket selling side, our opinion is this:</p>
<p>(V) The company should frankly announce the salary, subsidies, rice subsidies, etc. of the ticket sellers, how much each person can get per month, and whether this number can maintain their living expenses. This point can be determined most fairly by people from all walks of life based on the cost of living index published by the工部局every month, and based on the principle that it is suitable for them to live a comfortable life. If the company's salary is low and they must skim oil, then the fault lies with the capitalists; if the company's salary, in a fair judgment, is considered sufficient to maintain today's life, but they still want to skim oil and use the money skimmed from passengers on improper consumption, then the passengers have an unshirkable duty to stand up and sanction this endless illegal behavior.</p>
<p>We believe that our suggestion is definitely not biased towards any party. We hope everyone can explore and implement it.</p>
<p>As for the company, we hope that they can immediately provide the salary numbers of the ticket selling and ticket inspection personnel to the community for the fairest evaluation, because this is still the prerequisite for determining the previous points!</p>
<p>We hope that after the company can frankly announce it, it can properly deal with the "skimming oil problem" and have room for further discussion on the "price increase problem". We are eagerly looking forward to it!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>From the very first second he heard about the great changes in the political situation, in his heart that had been peaceful for several years, a dead volcano suddenly erupted with a burst of live fire. He wondered if this change in the situation would cause Yuan Baofan, who had been wielding power for many years, to perish with him, or even give Xiangqi a chance to regain her freedom.</p>
<p>For the past two or three days, this fantasy had been spinning in his mind hundreds, or even thousands, of times, but at the same time, his past experiences repeatedly warned him: warlords who lost power and went into exile rarely ended in complete ruin. Eight or nine times out of ten, they would take the wealth they had accumulated and escape into the concessions, living a comfortable life like immortals. If Yuan Maifan's end was like this, how could Luo Xiangqi regain her freedom?</p>
<p>The danger of his savings and the nanny's request to go back were like steel frames clamping down on his heart, almost making him feel out of breath, but as long as he thought:</p>
<p>"Maybe Xiangqi can come back!" His spirit would immediately become much more excited.</p>
<p>"Dang...dang...dang..." A mantel clock suddenly broke the silence of the winter night, striking ten times in a row.</p>
<p>The clock was placed in the center of a pear wood square table, flanked by a pair of couplets mounted on coral paper, which he had specially requested from a celebrity in Beijing when he built this house; the elegant characters wrote out a very natural collection of verses, with his stage name embedded in the upper and lower couplets, although the order was slightly reversed:</p>
<p>"After the begonia blooms, the swallows come, the courtyard at dusk. Red powder walls, swings, reflected in the water, people's homes."</p>
<p>He folded his hands behind his back and stared at the couplet, which was no longer very brightly colored, for a long time. Then he looked from the couplet to the clock, and from the clock to the tables, chairs, and all the furnishings in the house.</p>

<p>— Juewei</p>
<p>Ermao Niang has an Ermao; Sharp-Mouthed Godmother has a godson.</p>
<p>Ermao is only nineteen years old; the godson, however, is already in his "thirties."</p>
<p>If there is a chance to put the two of them together, then Ermao would appear very "disproportionate"; his appearance is neither outstanding above, nor is his clothing tattered below.</p>
<p>This alone is enough for Sharp-Mouthed Godmother to have a 100% sufficient reason—"My son is better than hers!"</p>
<p>Ermao Niang doesn't like to say her son is good. She often (or it can be said that she often) thinks very far, very high, higher than the "idle people" in the alley calling her "crazy."</p>
<p>Especially Sharp-Mouthed Godmother!</p>
<p>Mother is "crazy," son naturally becomes "a little crazy," so the actions of "crazy mother and crazy son" become the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>Peacefully, two months slipped away: it was the first day of the fourth month, at 5:07 (or 8) PM, that the incident happened!</p>
<p>When the godson brought back a large bag of "foreign candy," a tiny ghost-like head poked in behind him; "Ermao ran away!"</p>
<p>In that instant, Sharp-Mouthed Godmother suddenly had that feeling. Under the contrast between Ermao's departure and her godson's return with candy... limping, she rushed over and called out a "good... son..." that no one else could utter.</p>
<p>The godson received it without shame, and it would be impolite to refuse, "Godmother, how are you..." To give and take is the essence of courtesy!</p>
<p>Every household in the alley was like a wireless telegraph, and in less than the time it takes to eat a bowl of rice, they all knew about Ermao's matter; so Ermao Niang's house was unusually crowded with a large group of men, women, old, and young who "cared" about her - their necks were stretched out almost as long as if they were about to be beheaded, with no other purpose than to find out where Ermao had gone, so that they would have material for gossip in the evening.</p>
<p>"His mother?" Ermao Niang's eyes seemed to be gazing far, far away, "He went to a very good place to do good things..."</p>
<p>Immediately:</p>
<p>Crazy? Crazy. Crazy!</p>
<p>The godson was particularly "spirited" today; Sharp-Mouthed Godmother's eyes were smiling into a slit—"I said it long ago, my son is better than hers!"</p>
<p>Eating "foreign candy"...</p>

<h3 id="e71">Anecdotes of Jia Biyun <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Jia Biyun is dead, another old actor is gone! Twenty years ago, Biyun's reputation was at its peak. Between 1915 and 1916, he competed with Zhu Youfen and Mei Lanfang for the top spot among female impersonators in the old capital. For a time, critics of Peking Opera showed off their writing skills, each devoted to their cause. The storks and geese were lined up in battle, as fierce as fire! At that time, Zhu Youfen was taking the lead in the old capital as a正旦with her orthodox skills. Liu Shao, a Hunanese, was in charge of the Chinese Public Newspaper and strongly supported Youfen, gifting her with a long poem that included the lines, "You should become a beautiful旦in the human world, why must you be born beyond the realm of color? When called upon, the dragons will all bow their heads, supporting you to stand high on the jade mountain peak." "The chemical process has countless writing brushes, and there is no cover for the wonderful singing and dancing stage." He also imitated the Six Dynasties style and wrote an exhortation, with the words "People from Yunnan and people from the north have written a joint petition." The fantastic writing was highly praised! At this time, there were also many supporters of Biyun. Shao Shao also organized an election for the two of them on the newspaper, and as a result, Youfen won first place by one vote. When Lanfang saw the report, he was displeased. Shao Shao then compared Zhu and Mei and published a final election report, and Lanfang was also defeated. So the parties supporting Zhu and Jia, and Zhu and Mei, started to argue fiercely and endlessly for months. Someone with the pseudonym "Yunyun" wrote to Shao Shao and the head of Yimei Pavilion to mediate the matter, saying, "The beauty of an actor, both of you judge based on the time when they are wearing makeup. You don't know that Zhu plays the正旦and values solemnity, while Jia plays the花旦and should be enchanting. The solemnity and flirtatiousness of the attitude when wearing makeup is not enough to determine the beauty of the two actors... Please use Su Shi's poem: 'Short and long, fat and thin, each has its own purpose, who dares to hate Flying Swallow and Jade Ring?' to resolve the dispute for you all." The argument came to an end here. This also shows a glimpse of how the people of the capital admired Biyun at that time! In fact, at that time, literati and ministers who had lost their country all used choosing beauty as their main purpose, followed by drama art. The aesthetic points were slightly different, so the arguments were also different. I have never seen Youfen's drama, but as for Lanfang and Biyun, "elegance" and vulgarity" cannot be mentioned on the same day. The fact that Lanfang's reputation has been consistently high from beginning to end, and that Biyun was frustrated in his later years, can be believed from this. Is it lucky or unfortunate?</p>

<p>— Weiren</p>
<p>Burying Her Head in Hard Work, Never Leaving the Theater World</p>
<p>Working Hard on Writing, New Play About to Be Released</p>
<p>It was once rumored that Lan Lan was going to retire from the theater world, and the news seemed very true. Some people said that the film company did not allow her to perform outside, and others said that she had pleurisy, so she no longer went on stage. However, the fact is that she is still at Lafayette, and every night she is performing in "Ode to Righteousness," playing the Seventh Lady. What exactly is going on?</p>
<p>In order to understand the truth, the reporter had a conversation with her on a chance occasion. She spoke Mandarin very fluently, and she was very kind. The following is an excerpt from our conversation.</p>
<p>(Q): It is said that you have pleurisy. Is this a rumor or a fact?</p>
<p>(A): It's a fact, not a rumor. I have never had this disease before. My body is too weak now, and piecemeal work makes me unable to breathe all day long.</p>
<p>(Q): So are you planning to leave the theater world?</p>
<p>(A): I am very interested in drama. I learn in it every day, and I also seek a happy life in it. What others say about me is all rumors. In fact, my love for drama has become an element in my life. I can definitely answer that I will never leave the theater world.</p>
<p>(Q): Is filming busy?</p>
<p>(A): The filming of "Children of the World" has been completed, so I have been very free recently.</p>
<p>(Q): Has your pleurisy completely healed?</p>
<p>(A): Yes, thank you. I have been recently</p>
<p>(Q): Besides acting, what else do you do?</p>
<p>(A): I read newspapers and read scripts. I always feel that my acting skills are still very immature, especially my knowledge is too shallow.</p>
<p>(Q): I heard that you also like to write scripts.</p>
<p>(A): Yes, I started writing my script a month ago.</p>
<p>(Q): What kind of script is this?</p>
<p>(A): The name I originally set was "Seven Women," but now it has been changed to "Four Sisters."</p>
<p>(Q): What is the story of "Four Sisters"?</p>
<p>(A): I write about three biological sisters who have different personalities, and another woman who is a socialite. The intention of my script is very serious, and it is aimed at reality.</p>
<p>(Q): When can it be finished?</p>
<p>(A): In the next week or two.</p>
<p>(Q): Which theater group do you plan to give it to in the future?</p>
<p>(A): Probably the Shanghai Art Theater.</p>
<p>(Q): What is your impression of the Shanghai Art Theater?</p>
<p>(A): I respect this art group very much, and I am also willing to mingle with many young people. Now I am their basic actor.</p>
<p>(Q): Is the Shanghai Art Theater's treatment of you good?</p>
<p>(A): I can't say it's good, and I can't say it's bad, but my spirit is very happy. I often remember a sentence, which is: "We should not be greedy for pleasure, but should strive in a difficult environment."</p>
<p>When I said goodbye, I was also saying in my heart: "Yes, we must strive in a difficult environment!"</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Heroic Appearance and Valiant Battle</p>
<p>Tu, Yongtai said, "Although there are many outlaws, they are no more than a rabble of crows, and there is nothing to fear. As long as we can win one or two battles, people's hearts and morale will be greatly strengthened." Xu Jingdao said, "Since Uncle wishes to take the lead in the battle, I am willing to follow on the left and right and establish meritorious service together." Wang Yongtai said, "It would be best if my virtuous nephew can go with me." Zhou Yuji also said, "This way I can rest assured. Now I hear that the outlaws are no more than twenty miles away from the city. There is a Little Dragon River on the west side of Daizhou City. Old Wang and Military Officer Xu each lead five hundred troops to ambush there first. When the outlaws cross the river, attack them halfway and they will surely be victorious. Here, I will appoint Zhang Lie and Fan Chengyi to guard the city, and send out the militia to assist them. I will personally lead four hundred troops to support them." Wang Yongtai said, "I am honored to be sent by the General, and I am willing to exert my mediocre strength." So he and Xu Jing accepted the order, bid farewell to the yamen, mustered five hundred troops, and, carrying their weapons, each rode their warhorses out of the city. Wang Yongtai wielded a Zhangba serpent spear, while Xu Jing held a red-tasseled鑌鐵spear. Passing through the城門, they hurried along with their mouths closed. Having walked for ten miles, they only saw a river in front of them, the river water gurgling and flowing. Many refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, some walking and some in boats, crossed the river, their miserable appearance making people sad. Wang Yongtai knew that the outlaws were not far away, so he ignored the people and hurriedly ordered his subordinates to quickly ambush in the nearby woods to the east, not to reveal their whereabouts, and to wait for orders to attack. In an instant, five hundred troops were all hidden in the woods, and only refugees were seen fleeing on the official road. Wang Yongtai and Xu Jing dismounted, tied their horses to the trees, and stuck their spears and guns in the dirt. Choosing a tall green tree, they climbed up and sat on the branches, using the branches and leaves to cover their bodies, carefully watching the south bank of the Little Dragon River. After a while, the refugees all passed, the avenue was as silent as death, and not even half a oar could be seen in the Little Dragon River. The river water was scorched by the scorching sun, emitting a shimmering golden light. To the north of the river, the Yellow River was vast and desolate, even more bleak. A red sun gradually moved westward, and its light was like blood, shining on the distant mountain peaks, as if shrouded in a murderous aura. Just below Dao Mountain Peak, suddenly a cloud of dust rose into the sky. (92)</p>
<h3 id="e74">After Seeing "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>The performers of "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" are artists of Chinese Peking opera, but with Western music accompaniment, which is the greatest feature. This is not a speculative attempt, but the crystallization of the musician Father Summerolov's painstaking efforts. The actors practiced for only a few months, and were not exactly famous stars, but after being matched with the music, they gave people a special feeling. Moreover, the plot of the play is also very ordinary, so it can be said that the success is due to the music, which is very reasonable. From silent movies to sound movies is a step forward, but from musicals to pantomimes is also definitely a step forward. They are going to perform in the United States, and naturally there is no need for Chinese singing and dialogue, which is really the most suitable.</p>
<p>The whole play is divided into three acts, with tense moments, fantasy moments, and pleasant moments. In terms of music, it is played in various different ways, so that those who are used to listening to symphonies will want to listen, and those who are used to listening to jazz will also want to listen. There is Western art, and also Eastern flavor. It is a pity that the actors and the rhythm of the music are somewhat uncoordinated, but after all, it is not an easy task, and it has been a very short time, so it can be regarded as a great success. This musician is of short stature, and he has sharp and kind eyes. According to himself, he has a strong interest in Chinese opera. This "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" is one of his masterpieces, and it is worth seeing.</p>

<p>— Written by a Person from the North and South, Illustrated by Zhang Yuwo</p>
<p>(14) Guan Dayuan</p>
<p>Guan Dayuan, styled Yuming, is the eldest son of the late martial actress Guan Zilin. He is skilled in the art of old male roles; whether it is wearing a headpiece, imperial hat, or official robe, he is excellent in everything. In the years 1922 and 1923, among the old male actors in the former capital who were admired, besides Wang Youchen, Wang Fengqing, and Lei Xifu, Dayuan should be mentioned. His fame actually came earlier than that of Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying. When he assisted Xu Biyun was his most popular period. His performances were traditional and did not follow the trends. However, due to his bulky figure and unflattering appearance, he was not highly regarded. He struggled in the opera world, unable to achieve his ambitions, but those who appreciated music praised his adherence to the classical style. He went south the year before last and joined the Gengxin Stage. Five batches of new actors have been changed, but the male role actor is still Guan Dayuan alone, and people call him "Guan Dayuan winning five championships in a row." He has two younger brothers, both disciples of Fu Liancheng. Guan Sheng practices singing old male roles, and Guan Shengji plays the clown. Both are outstanding talents of the third class of the Fu Society, it is said.</p>
