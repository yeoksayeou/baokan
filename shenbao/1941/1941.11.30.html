<h3>尋求太平洋持久和平美國立場堅定不移　認日本行動與希特勒如出一轍　日軍不退出中國越南決不妥協</h3>
<p>合衆社二十九日華盛頓電　美國昨日顯對遠東尖銳危機、採取不可移動之立塲、堅持維持現狀及淸除日本在中國及越南之勢力最可靠政界人士稱、太平洋和平之賡續、全在日本能否於最後關頭接受美國之誘掖以實現此程序、政府最高方面稱、關於中國問題、絕無其他折衷辦法、此舉使日本謀成立暫時協定、維持目前所得而保證不作新侵略之希望紛碎無遺、同時羅斯福總統稱、日本特使來栖尙未拂來東京對美國太平洋立塲之答覆、政府高級人員將日本現時之遠東行動、與昔日德軍於進攻希臘以前侵入羅匈等國之行動相提並論、該方面稱、美國尙願證明日軍行動之目標不在於此、俾進一步談判之門戶尙洞開未閉、羅斯福總統表示、渠或將再與日本使節會晤、惟稱渠無肯定之約期、衆信美政府認日軍侵泰或侵滇緬路、將對美國兩種威脅、　將威脅主要原料之來源、　將威脅羅斯福總統之對華租軍政策、消息靈通人士稱、租軍政策必將執行、即訴諸武力亦所不惜、彼等指出羅斯福總統在最近之演詞中、曾保證將原料交予中英、渠此演說衆認毫無保留條件云、據昨日所得最可靠情報表示、太平洋能否繼續和平、端視日本能否於最後關頭應允美國之勸導、將軍隊全數撇出中國、並在遠東其他各地暫時保持現狀、惟最可靠方面稱、羅斯福總統與國務卿赫爾刻仍尋求所謂暫時維持現狀、該方面又稱、惟此事並不影響美國對中國及越南之根本政策、並謂美國堅持日本必須立即中止對中國及其他遠東國家之侵略、此意絕難讓步、東京對美國强硬通吿、將如何作答、此間正在等候、惟未悉東京之回覆字裏行間、是否將留進一步談判之餘地、抑日本將逕前作籌備已久之進一步侵略耳、彼等又言、自地圖上硏究之、日本現時侵華及越南之形勢、已威脅菲律濱及美國其他遠東利益、日本南進對菲島之威脅、無異完成其馬蹄式之對菲包國、此間表示美國決對此威脅予以反抗、惟和戰之取決端在東京、自本年四月以來、美國已草就和平解決之網目、其中包括中日戰事如能公平解決則遠東當恢復正常經濟關係、各國將有取得原料之權利、據稱、國務卿赫爾以忍耐之態度進行談判、惟日本則於此時遺派遠征軍入越南、高級方面稱、美國玫府曾設法對日本維待最忍耐之政策、惟日本迄今仍未對美國星期三之堅定通吿予以答覆、此等方而咸稱、美日談話以中日和乎及在太平洋成立永久不侵約、以換取穩定夕經濟關係為目的、惟日本陸軍則造派遠征軍至越南、使美國官吏深感日本此種方法、與前此希特勒所採取者平行相類、日軍之粉紛入越、與前此納粹侵佔捷克及其他歐洲國家之行動無異、高級方面又稱、日本之軍事馬蹄形勢包圍菲島、美國不得不認日本之侵略越南及其他遠東國家、實為直接威脅美國之領土利益、不獨對菲律濱為然、在整個太平洋亦然云、</p>
<p>路透社二十九日華盛頓電　「必爾狄摩太陽報」有美國人民必須準備對日作戰之語、今日華盛頓之與情、確可以此語充分槪括之、惟此亦如羅斯福總統昨在新聞記者詢以太平洋局勢將否惡化時所發之答語、乃日本所當答復之問題也、日本是否將對美開戰、唯東京　決定之、目前日本所可行者計有三途、　依允美國在東方多年立塲中之要點、　在經濟限制削弱其力愛時依然猶豫不定、　作孤注一擲之奮鬥、華盛頓郵報稱、來栖使命在視美國是否虛聲恫嚇、任華府要津今已明白表示美國不欲稍變其對華立塲矣云、此間有遠東經騐之非官塲觀察家多抱一種觀念、以為日軍閥不能退出中國而猶握在日本國內之大權、亦不能毫不活動、致日本因經濟限制而陷於破產地位、以意度之、彼等寗願榮譽的失敗於美國等之手、庶猶可保持其在國內之政權耳、</p>
<p>越南日軍激增泰國極度不安</p>
<p>路透社二十九日新加坡電　路透社頃由極可恃方面探悉、據所接報吿、過去數日中日本在越南登陸之增援軍隊、實為美國務卿赫爾中止華盛頓談話之預兆、此項增援日軍以飛機佔主要部份、更有若十步兵與砲隊、最近亦在西貢上陸、惟至今日越南所有日軍之確數是否已超過五六萬人、則尙屬疑問、距今約一月前日本在越南之飛機僅約百架、衆信在近數日中、飛機數量至少已增至五百架矣、越南之多數地方、一月前尙均為澤國、惟目霎雨停止之後、日人已僱用大批越南工人、改良擴大機塲之地址、此間消息靈通人士仍覺日本尙未至立即對泰採取行動之地位、但其準備目前似已頗見提前、如果決定以陸海空與第五縱隊之閃電攻勢加諸盤谷、則為期當不在遠、日方祇須續派少數飛機及軍隊並調軍艦由海南島向　邏海　突進、即足予泰京以致命打擊、惟欲征服或佔領泰國之內地、則將另為一事、泰國內地山嶺綿耳、森林濃密、日人欲進行此項軍事行動、所需軍隊或將校現在越境所準備者大為增加、不過在日人方面或以為在ABCD各國決定採取何種行動及英相所允派海上援軍能大量趕到之前迅速予盤谷以攻擊、亦將為攫取泰國精華之必要手段、此種可能性亦不能斷言其必無、故有理由可信日軍將以為彼等如以迅速及有效之手段採取上述戰略、則或可避免與ABCD各國發生軍事糾紛也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社廿九日紐約電　據英國方面傳稱、泰國政府業已派遺軍事代表團前往新加坡、俾與該地英國當局舉行會議、</p>
<p>路透社二十九日河內電　越南日方要人皆謂遠東緊張時局之實弛與否、全視華府會議之結果而定、此間許多方面以為時局達於最嚴重之點、故對於華盛頓傳來之消息、莫不予以極大之注意、紐約非官塲傳來日軍撒退越南為美國主要立塲之情報、越南各報皆以大字刋載之、讀者暫為之一慰、但見比方在越南之準備繼續不輟、則覺日本未必肯接受此項要求也、雖若干消息靈通者認日本未能有發動國外大戰爭之餘力、惟泰國陸軍之價値乃完全令人糢糊之謎、僅知泰軍有若干新式設備而已、日軍久經戰爭、且遭極利於進攻之地勢、勝負之分不難逆知、而英美對泰迄未有特殊軍事上保證為泰國遭第三國侵略時之後援、此間人士遂不能不起驚異、殆ABCD列强僅以保守其自己最後防綫為滿足、而泰國之被侵略未必為大戰勃　之微兆歟、衆料民治國所給予泰國之唯一有效利器、厥為飛機、泰國有此亦或足以致勝、因聞ABCD遠東防務中之飛機、確較日機為優也、致於越南聞將在遠東戰事中、仍保持中立、但交戰國之一旣以越南為其作戰之出發點、則中立之不能保護越南產業、自無待言矣、</p>
<p>決心抵抗侵略澳緬有備無患</p>
<p>合衆社二十九日紐約電　哥倫比亞廣播公司昨日聆得澳國廣播、謂澳國戰時顧問委員會於研究來自華盛頓東京及倫敦之外交情報後、已核准首相寇丁所擬之澳國戰事政策宣言、據悉、寇丁之文吿與前此太平洋政策宣言相符、按前此之宜言、鄭重指出澳國極願保持和平、惟該國並將抵抗侵略、自衛實力亦至强大云、</p>
<p>路透社廿九日仰光電　今日緬甸總督頒發布吿、授權緬甸駐軍總司令指揮緬甸之邊防軍以牧指揮統一之效、一般人皆認此項辦法、為緬甸準備抵抗侵略中之一重要步驟、緬甸邊防軍共計許多聯隊、皆曾受邊境軍事行動之精良訓練、服務成績極優、緬甸境內各機塲之地面防務、實際上皆由該軍負責、緬甸政府又宜布決定成立一種以全緬為基礎之機關、賦有獲得主要食糧供給、並統制其支配之全權、其詳細辦法現正在緊急擬具中、</p>
<p>英美經濟制日將施全面封鎖</p>
<p>路透社二十九日偏敦電　泰晤士報駐華盛頓訪員討論美日關係之最近發展云、目前之問題、即為日本是否意圖進攻泰國或滇省或變方並進、華盛頓若干人士認為日本如果有此意、則其對於屋期三晚間美方公文之答覆、恐將延至此項軍事行動巳在進行之時、同時又有一部份人士則謂、現時對日之經濟限制或將立即擴大為全面經濟封鎖、且將不作任何預先之警吿、倘使最後之挑釁果將加諸美國、或可斷言將予以接受、因任何其他途徑、不但將影響太平洋、且將及於歐洲、美國之民衆即在中西部各州者、如見目前所深切懷疑之國家今竟任其如願以償、亦將深為震動也、</p>
<p>德允軍事援助日本有所期待</p>
<p>合衆社二十九日華盛頓電　渥海華州民主黨參議員吉利特本日宜稱、渠曾自可靠之非官方面獲悉、希特勒曾應允於明年二月間、與日本以鉅大之軍事援助、並謂至來年一月、維希將被迫而將其艦隊移交與穗、該方面並稱、日本希望蘇聯戰事不久即可結束、吉利特相信日美談判除或將成立一稽延之休戰外無協定之可能、吉氏謂來栖之來美、係欲苟延以待德國援助日本進攻泰國及滇緬路云、</p>
<p>路透社二十九日東京電　此間各當局評述外傳美國已決定在緬甸公路上空、設置空中巡邏之消息時、謂此行種此動將認為係屬直接的敵對行為、並為ABCD陣錢各國方面最含挑撥性武裝侵略之一例、日本廣知時報亦評論民治各國曾通知泰國保護其中立之說云、倘使此舉之意義、係派遣佔領軍開入泰國、則將造成甚嚴重之形勢云、</p>
<p>英國海相警吿日本懸崖勒馬為時未晚</p>
<p>路透社二十九日勃萊克波爾電　海相亞歷山大今日在勃萊克波爾軍艦週開幕典禮中發表演說時、曾提及太平洋問題、謂吾人在遠東方面、目覩舊日同盟之日本現正徬徨於失足即鑄大錯之邊際、日本各領袖嘗自稱國家現在十字路口、但導之至此種地位者果為誰歟、美國與吾人之善意與合作、因隨時沿理智與和平之大道、聽任日本之調度也、實則領導日本至目前之嚴重困境者為其軍閥、余信日本許多賢明之士、當可洞悉利害、並信其若干領袖必將進賢明之勸告、而不忍使其墮入深淵、倘使日本準備與公理及理智之力量從事合作、則無人可疑在東亞方面正有偉大與光榮之命運靜候降臨其身也、亞氏又稱、日本所能期望於希特勒者、除義大利所遭遇之情形外、別無其他、希氏將利用日本以推進其兇謀、一且目的達到、即將棄為不顧、亞氏末稱、英海軍為使大軍配備與接濟得由海上作數千哩之運輸起見、曾屢破敵人揚威海上、其功續殊不可磨滅云、</p>
<h3>羅斯福召國防領袖　會商應付遠東事變　太平洋美船暫不武裝</h3>
<p>路透社二十九日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨赴溫泉渡其週杪假期以前、曾與國防各領袖檢討政府對於應付遠東任何不測事件所擬之辦法、羅總統所暗者、為海長諾克斯·陸長史汀生·陸軍參謀長馬顯爾·與海軍參謀長史達克·國務卿赫爾亦曾晋謁總統。</p>
<p>路透社二十九日華盛頓電　聞諸可恃方面、美國確已銷滅在中國問題上對日妥洽之可能性、於是發生太平洋中美船武裝之問題、白宮咋日聲稱、太平洋中美船在目前環境下不致武裝、羅斯福總統在新聞記者招待會中、答目前環境可支持多久之問話謂、此問宜由東京答之、總統又謂對日談判未曾決裂、惟渠或因日本局勢而於星期一日以前即離溫泉、關於談判之消息泰半出於東京、其故以美國政策極端忍耐也、總統復稱、駛往西班牙葡萄牙與其附近島嶼及南美中美之美船、皆不擬武裝云、</p>

<h3>東報論調　表示悲觀　美國態度堅決　談判難獲成就</h3>
<p>合衆社二十九日東京電　日本報紙今日對目前暫停以等候日本致美之覆文之華盛頓談判、繼續表示悲觀、「朝日新聞」於一特殊社評中稱、除非美國放棄其基本原則、談判不能獲得成功、並聲言談判必須根據實際、同時報紙更於封面刋登海軍檢查部發出之日本艦隊照片、該照片刊登之目的、為表示日本海軍能絕對保護太平洋、「朝日新聞」又稱、日本將「直至最一分鐘」仍盡其最高能力、以維持太平洋之和平、該報結論稱、「日本四週之環境已趨極度緊張以致日本不願再費時間於談判上」、「日日新聞」稱、美國如過份自信一已之國力、而堅持日本接受其見解、「則日本將須中止目前之談判、向儘速採取必要之步」云、</p>
<h3>紐約日僑準備　全部撤退　日人銀行及公司　均相繼停止營業</h3>
<p>合衆社二十九日東京電　「朝日新聞」頃刋佈紐約訪員之電訊、謂日美關係嚴重、以前受凍結命令影響而仍留之日僑、決定離美、將於十二月十四日乘船返國、所有在紐約之日人銀行及公司、將僅留一二負資人員、所有該地之日本俱樂部及學會等均將封閉云、</p>
<p>路透社二十九日紐約電　路透社從日領著探悉、紐約日人銀行擬閉門停業、彼等現準備將其所剩餘之營業、轉交獨留於此之橫濱正金銀行、此時各日人銀行之紐約經理人對於美日間現有緊張地位之最後結果、亦猶他人漫無把握、某經理人吿人、渠怕讀報紙云、首擬停業者為三井銀行、至少有其他四家將繼之閉門、當然日銀行之停閉、係與美日談話之緊張階段相適應、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>兩週來美日談話回顧</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統於本月二十七日接見日本代表，會談四十五分鐘，翌日在白宮召集「戰事內閣」會議，會後卽赴喬治亞溫泉別墅，渡其週末例假，臨行曾向報界發表談話，謂美日談判並未決裂，但今後究能繼續多久，須問日本，同時總統認為太平洋和戰關鍵完全繫於日本。從羅氏出京一舉觀之，可見美國政府現正等待日本就赫爾所致牒文，提出答覆，因此在東京正式作答之前，雙方談話顯已陷於停頓。回顧自來栖抵達華府，以迄今日，為時剛好半月，吾人雖早已斷言其必無成就，但中間却也極盡波譎雲詭之能事，有一時期甚至使人懷疑美國容或重彈綏靖舊調，此一疑團直至赫爾致送牒文重申堅決立塲之後，方始冰釋。在這美日談話不絕如縷的此際，吾人倘將最近兩週來華府方面的外交活動，一加追溯，或者對於今後大局的觀察，不無幫助。</p>
<p>在日本特使來栖抵美後的兩星期中，美日雙方代表前後共經會談六次，但中間美國却召集過兩次ABCD集團會議，兩次「戰事內閣」會議，僅此一點卽足以充分證明：　美國此次對日進行談話，並非專為一己利益，而係代表遠東整個民治陣綫發言，　美國政府雖一方進行外交折衝，他方却絕未忽略其在軍事方面所應進行之準備。來栖係於本月十五日行抵美京，是日適為星期六，延至十七日始與羅斯福總統及赫爾國務卿作第一次會晤，歷時七十分鐘，厥後來栖野村二人又於十八，二十，二十二，二十七諸日，連續與赫爾談話四次。就中十八日一次歷時二時四十五分，據說赫爾曾竭力勸吿日本放棄侵略，退出軸心，並說明日本改弦易轍後所可獲致的利益：二十日雖是感恩節，但雙方仍繼續會談一小時，據事後所傳出的消息，日方殆要求三點：　ABCD聯合陣綫須予鬆弛，　美國須减少對華援助，　美國須中止對日本建造「東亞新秩序」的努力行使壓迫，這三點等於東條三原則的重述，至於日方所願付出之代價，據聞也有三點：　不與德國直接合作，　停止對荷印及西比利亞作軍事威脅，　願儘早結束中國戰事，這和美國所堅持的三大原則，卽退出軸心，放棄侵略與撤退中國越南駐軍，在程度上顯有絕大的距離，其中尤以撤軍與退出軸心兩項，為民治陣綫所必爭。日方的意向旣因兩次會談，而輪廓畢露，赫爾便於二十二日，召開第一次遠東五强會議，據事後發表，與會各國意見完全一致，並且均願擁誰美國在對日談話中所持的立塲，當晚赫爾又與日本代表長談三小時，二十四日星期一，赫爾又接看召集第二次五强會議，正在這時候，外間便起了種種離奇的傳聞，不曰民治各國意見未臻一致，卽是說美國已準備和日本訂立一種臨時協定，以三月為期，俾在太平洋上對立「喘息機會」；也正在這時候，一方莫斯科前綫形勢緊急，一方希特勒又忽然召開所謂反共公約簽字各國會議，企圖對抗華盛頓方面所進行的外交爭奪戰，這樣擾攘了三四天，直至二十六日羅斯福總統接見來子文胡適二氏，同時赫爾又以包含美國外交各項基本原則的牒文面交來栖野村之後，眞相纔大白於世，所謂美國對日讓步之說，纔一變而為美國堅持一貫立塲，一時頗為囂張的臨時協定空氣，至此也一變而成為美日談話瀕於破裂的局面。這一局面，已因羅斯福總統的離開華府消渡例假，而多少獲得證實。</p>
<p>其實世人祇祗稍稍注意美日兩國的基本立塲，以及雙方在過去兩週間的實際行動，卽不難測知華府談話的最後運命，必歸失敗，良以東條三原則之決難與赫爾十四點相調和，旣為舉世所共知，同時日本之利用談判時間，不斷增兵越南和加緊威脅泰國，尤足揭露東京當局毫無放棄侵略的誠意，而美國的繼續充實遠東兵力，援助中國加强邊防，甚至考盧派兵駐紮荷印，也正可表示華盛頓當局決不肯上日本烟幕外交的當。因此吾人瞻望遠東大局，認為除非東條知難而退，恐怕他日隨伴着美日談判決裂而來的，將為正義和暴力兩方的實行「攤牌」。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談</p>
<h3>作戰兩年後的德國</h3>
<p>這篇是美國生活圖畫週報駐柏林訪員斯蒂芬雷爾特的報吿，譯錄如下：</p>
<p>一日，希特勒元首正在演說。我坐在一輛出差汽車中，從沿路幾百架傳聲器中聽到他的演說。我輕輕拍着汽車夫的肩頭道：「他在那裏說些甚麽呢？」汽車夫想了一想，答道：「他說我們一定會戰勝的。」我又問他道；「然則你以為怎樣呢？」他默然不語，我以為他不會答覆的了。隔了一會，他纔沉着的答道：「是啊！我以為我們巳經戰勝了，現在我正希望和平的到來呢。」</p>
<p>這是德國人民的感想。不過在希特勒統治下的德國中，人民的感想是無足重輕。他們自己也承認這一點，所以提到德國政府，時常稱做「他們」而不稱做「我們」。</p>
<p>我在德國居住了七個月，德國人民的態度，始終是這個樣子，並沒有改變——總是態度落漠，熱心愛國，刻苦工作，無暇游戲，食物雖然粗劣，但尙不致缺乏。他們的政府，亦巳經過一番變動。所謂「國社黨革命」早巳壽終正寢了。未來的潮流，正顯示着從前的黑影——軍人專政。黨的勢力巳趨式微，國家經濟巳趨向反動，就是希特勒本人亦巳變了</p>
<p>經過八年來轟轟烈烈的成就之後，希持勒巳自命為超人受身份地位不如己者的忠吿，對於逆耳之言，一概置若罔聞。凡不頭失歡於希特勒的人，都巳知道不能再向這位獨裁者提出任何不入耳的建議或報吿。至少有四個人，本來遇有緊急大事，隨時可以進見希特勒的，都對我說，他們現在縱能見到元首，亦非等候數星期之久不可。旦在接見之時，希特勒輒向他們發表一己的見解，滔滔不絕，使他們所要提出的緊急問題，完全沒有進言的機會。</p>
<p>現在已沒有人敢當着希特勒發問的了。有幾個常奧他接角的　吿訴我，他們不獨在希特勒面前，祗有唯唯諾諾，無敢抗違，而且在連聲稱是之際，莫不仰之若天神。今天沒有一個人敢向希特勒說：「德國人需要和平，他們對於緊束褲帶和延長工作時間，巳覺得痛心疾首，他們很想放鬆一點，並嘗嘗他所允許的勝利之果是何滋味」。今天也沒有人敢對他說。「德國多數靑年皆痛恨政府的束轉，甚至在佔領地內他所深愛的多數日耳曼人，也並不覺得巳被解放」。當他在一個工廠內向一羣歡呼的工人演說時，他不知道其中多數皆是穿着工人服裝的黨員，至於眞正工人，巳給假休息半天去了。希特勒却滿以為德國人個個皆像瘋狂似的擁護着他哩</p>
<p>因此，當希特勒決定進攻蘇俄之時，甚至沒有一個將領敢直截的吿訴他說：殲滅紅軍，至少需三星期以上的時間。德國將領皆知道，蘇俄的兵力，較他們以前所遇到的各國，要强大的多。德國在俄又沒有預先準備的「游歷隊」，蘇俄政府亦不像希特勒所設想的容易推翻。可是他們曩日的預言都沒有應騐過。他們對於萊因流域的進兵，馬奇諾防綫的突破，和法國的土崩瓦解，都曾表示過懷疑。希特勒却能料事如神，算無遺策。他似乎是一個軍事天才。所以希特勒若說紅軍可在三星期內解決，就是三星期算了，還有誰敢說個「不」字呢。</p>
<p>希特勒巳不復僅僅是一個領導政治的元首了。他巳是一個所向莫敵軍事勝利者，他的生活呢亦常榮週於軍事方面。他因長時間硏究軍事學，而於用兵之術，巳能深得個中秘奧。他是德國最高統帥和神機軍師，他的地位是沒有人可與分庭抗禮的。除了陸軍參謀部之外，他自己還有一個軍事參謀團，而以郁特爾將軍Alfred　Jodl為長，郁特爾將軍每天至少與他會面一次，就他的意見代為策劃，再行提交陸軍參謀部。</p>
<p>希特勒對於此層，極感愉快，因為這是他所時常夢想之事。他最喜歡的一張油盡就是繪着他明盔亮甲，坐在馬背上的雄姿。他非常重視這一幅圖畫現在全國地方巳到處張掛了。做一個偉大的軍事戰勝者，實際上當然要比做一個商店主人和其他失敗的中產階級的政治領袖，更為好玩得多了。</p>
<p>希特勒除往前綫督戰之外，常在貝許德斯加登和柏林兩地，他的日常生活，大致相同。他常於淸晨二時就寢，非至十一時不起床，他實際睡眠不過四小時左右，其餘時間多費在默想或讀書。據知道他的人說，希特勒每天閱書兩冊，多係關於軍備或軍事歷史的專門書籍。他看書很快，且能過目不忘。</p>
<p>每日朝晨，他常在一個綠色磁盆中洗澡，自己用鍍金剃刀修面，他在柏林的時候，雖也有一個理髪師和修指甲的，從凱撤霍夫旅館的理髮室前去伺候。他常年穿一套樸素的制服，這是他自己所創造的，採取國社黨制服的式樣，而改用陸軍制服的顏色。</p>
<p>他的飲食很簡單，且很有常規。他一個人在臥室中早餐，喝的是中國茶，吃的是稀飯，土司，奶油和糖醬。午餐有凉拌菜，鷄蛋，水果，和不含酒精的啤酒，晚餐大致與午餐相同，有時加一道湯，飯或薄餅。希特勒十幾年來所用的廚子，身體矮胖，名喚孟南堡，昔日曾在柏林開設菜館，精於烹飪奧大利菜餚，尤善製希特勒所愛吃的麵點，可是希特勒現在要為國人表率，已經不大吃了。</p>
<p>希特勒所飲不含酒精的啤酒，是一家慕尼克酒廠為他特製的，賓客們隨便歡喜飲什麽酒都可以，祇是不准吸烟。希特勒把烟認做天下最毒的東西，所以常說他寗看見他的仇人吸烟，却不歡喜看見他的朋友吸烟。希特勒在餐時喜述名人軼事，摹仿他人動作，這是他獨具的天才。</p>
<p>希特勒出外時代步的，有一架雙引擎康杜爾式飛機，一輛梅賽特朋士黑色放行汽車，一輛梅賽特朋士六輪灰色軍用車，和一列專用火車，備他乘坐，飛機和車輛上面都裝有無綫電，火車上並有一節裝着發報機和收報機，以收取世界各國的消息。</p>
<p>希特勒的家庭是由三位婦女管理—林琪，克洛斯和容琪夫入—所雇僕人，都是靑年巳婚，生有子女的少婦。希特勒白天總是跑來跑去或在蹀　室中的時候口授命令，難得看見他坐在寫字檯前。他以出外散步作為運動，在衣袋中裝滿有殼果子，去喂松鼠。他是一個善於守候的專家，常幾個月的靜伏不動，祇在暗中運籌策劃。一朝發動，便緊張興奮，好似年紀比平時輕了許多，眞有靜如處女，動如脫兎之槪。</p>
<p>希特勒除以戰爭為游戲外，在過去牛年中也有時看看世界各國的圖畫雜誌，（包括生活在內，這是由德國外交人員飛送給他的），審查每週的新聞片，編訂總司令部的戰報，靜聽華格納唱片，他稱之為日耳曼主義全盛時代的理想表現（一個歌劇演員語我，希特勒已聽過此片二百次了）（未完）</p>

<h3>伍德海廣播演說　向日本致諍言　獨霸政策世人決難接受若能覺司即恢復繁榮</h3>
<p>著名外籍評論家伍德海氏、最近在華美　臺作廣播演說、題為「如日本能恢復理智」全文見大陸報、迻譯大意於后、「現下日本有一部份人民、竟希冀日蘇對遠巿問題、能獲致妥協、日外務省機關報日水泰晤士報等即曾提出七項、促使美國同意、以為維持東亞和平之條件、日內閣首相、亦曾發表三項目標、皆為日本希望能於華府談判中達到者、惟上述二種要求、美政府決不願予以接受、</p>
<p>各國因循鑄成大錯</p>
<p>一九二七年田中奏摺、鼓吹征服世界、若干日人雖亦巳斥為怪誕不經之論，但就各種事實證明、日本之政策、實無疑為機會所造成者彼曾藉佔領東三省、以試騐各國之反應、而結果竟未受絲毫之阻滯、　　三七年蘆溝橋事變、彼之目標、原非遠大、初不過欲據以為華北軍事行動之藉口、不料事變範圍日廣、而世界各國之熊度、竟昭示與彼在前進途徑上、決不致遭遇任何有力打擊、是年冬季、彼尙有接受和平談判之意、以為應適可而止、不料各國一誤再誤、</p>
<p>德日懷抱旨趣不同</p>
<p>吾人但見由中國「新秩序」進而至於「東亞新秩序」、此後又有所謂「大凍亞新秩序」與「大東亞共榮圈」後者包括中國·澳洲·與馬來亞、若以松罔言論、嚴重解釋、則加利福尼亞亦在其範圍之內、然此皆為日本軍人之意回、日本政府最初圖尙無此種懷抱、直至最近歐戰爆發後、始予以空前之機會、以完成其目標、日本因事實上之需要、而加入軸心國、德人之衷心、甚願見日本與英美相見於戰塲之上、如此不特能牽制英美、目可使日本本身力量削弱、俾德國可以所向</p>
<p>懸崖勒馬尙係時機</p>
<p>余（伍氏自稱）之妄想、山最近華盛頓之來電而起，該電略舉美國所提之條件、而此條件假使為日本所接受、故余乃夢想日本能終有淸醒之一日也、今美國所提條件、為促使日本退出軸心、最低限度亦應保證不加入軸心作戰、放棄南進北進之企圖、自中國及越南撤兵、以及保證太平洋上各國商業機會均等、今吾人假定日人巳接受此項條件、</p>
<p>否則禍害不堪設想</p>
<p>據日藏相於彼被請求增加三·八〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元補充費時、對議會言、政府因事變以來支出總額約為四八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、約為一九三六年前七十年歲出之總和、彼並承認英美凍結法令，對於日本確有嚴重之影響，因此若凍結令仍嚴厲執行、「中國事變」仍未獲解決、而日本又與英美發生戰事、則除陸軍海軍損失外、其經濟之困難、實將使今後日人之生活、不堪設想、</p>
<p>恢復繁榮並非難事</p>
<p>然而若能接受美國條件、則其前途必能煥然一新、在中國事變與東北事變、所受之經濟損失、雖須積年累月始能彌補、然而其經濟前途、必能於數月內頓改舊觀、趨向繁榮、日軍如能撤離中國、則中日之間、必能免除障碍、而可通力合作、日本向時圖謀之壟斷、必須放秦、以其在地理上隣近中國、定可自中國得到不少經濟利益、同時將其數近百萬之軍隊遣散、則在其實業發展上可平添無窮之人力、日本目前因忙於戰爭、及應付事變、故決無餘力從事貿易及航業、美國所提出之太平洋國家商業機會均等條件、自將解釋為予日本以同等權利、使共自由取用馬來·荷印·澳門·美國以及中國之原料、英美則仍須致力於事火生產如此、則日本於生產後商品市塲上皆享有絕好之機會、日本目前徵作軍用之商船、彼時自可用於太平洋供給綫上、</p>
<p>生存毀滅聽其抉擇</p>
<p>國家光榮觀念，目前於日本絕非至要、目前日本之出路、係非生存即滅亡、非繁榮即毀滅、彼可忍受目前之犧牲、而永遠立於文明國家之地位、此此微之犧牲、在數年後、即足以補償、如不變初衷、則必陷於毀滅、設使日本能改變目前狀態、彼應即歸向於彼忠誠之友邦、與之合作而永遠為世界之强國、日本對於合作二字之解釋、向予曲解、因合作之本意、乃共同努力、以達同一目標、而非用武力仳服他人、以遂一已之私願、除非日本能自巳滌凈以往四年所造成之仇恨、則東亞將永遠無和平之一日矣</p>

<h3>舞女解除婚約後險遭其夫電斃　嚴蔭鶴殺人未遂判罪五年</h3>
<p>住居黃河路一號之河南女子鍾玉梅、年十九歲、在爵祿舞廳充當舞女、本年三月間、結識一舞客蘇州人嚴蔭鶴（年二十九歲）、當時嚴自稱尙未授室、擬與鍾作永偕白首之計、鍾被其甘言所誘、竟於五月間登報與嚴訂婚、並即實行同居、詎自同居之後、始發覺嚴實係一</p>
<p>無業游民</p>
<p>衣食住行、悉賴鍾女伴舞所入供給、不足復用盡種種方法、以詐取女之私蓄達四千餘金、女不堪其苦、遂於九月間、設法與嚴解除婚約、但嚴仍不時至女處纏繞不休、前日下午三時許、嚴至漢口路五七一號亞洲旅館、闢二百四十二號房間即以電話致鍾女、以代購冬季大衣為由、</p>
<p>誘女前來</p>
<p>而此時嚴因無法再取得女之金錢、故巳起殺女之心、竟效法周氏兄弟弒父之方法、向法租界寗波路舊貨攤上購得極長之電綫一捲、及撲落三只、在電錢之兩端、均安置撲落各一、另以電燈頭撲落一個、裝於室內之電燈上、然後將一端之撲落挿入、使該電錢上</p>

<h3>黃金供給為多　變動範圍漸小</h3>
<p>昨日現金始赤暗市、變動轉小、勢續趨疲、價一度退入一萬三千元內、因美日談判難獲確實消息、各方人心平疲、塲內交易供躉求零、祥興永出四百六十兩、天元進四百二十兩、明豐出三百八十兩、由成記進三百八十兩、合盛與滙票商各進一百七九十兩、中興進一百四十兩、仍難敵賣勢、價由晨開一萬三千五百元曾銳退見一萬二千九百五十元低價、為浮空抵補所拉上、收市仍軋小四百元、半日交易七千三百六十兩、下午週六無市、塲外價為一萬三千三百元、</p>
<p>現金續降四百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點開市為一萬三千五百元、與上日晚收價同、祥和·祥興永·明豐·天元來力售、價頓傾瀉五百五十元、入一萬三千元內、降至一萬二千九百五十元低價、成記忽來猛進、祥和復購合盛·永成·滙票商·中興爭進力抬、回起三百元、升至一萬三千二百五十元、祥興永·同康永·天元再賣、重見下退為一萬三千零五十元、十點半收市一萬三千一百元、比上日晚收續降四百元、半日有五百五十元差度、下午無市、金號本牌金門市售價、一萬三千四百元、收進减千元左右、</p>
<p>首飾余先小後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均先掛小五十元、為一千三百五十元、下午一點半回升三十元、計一千三百八十元、（收進减一百五十元）、紋銀仍懸二十二元、黑市十六元均平云、</p>
<h3>黑滙始終平定</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、中央與匯豐兩掛牌無伸縮、匯豐等小櫃檯價亦平、英美匯黑黑市英滙一辦士叫三七五、有供無求、始終平定、美匯略露軟化、三元七五不一定可結得、某非必需品洋行曾起扒結未獲、無成交、午收與上價同、比上日英平、美略軟、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊各跌十元、英金票升一元、美金票一度退至二十六元半、最後為二十七元四角、比上日計漲二角、香港票略疲、日金票及朝鮮票均無變動、前者仍站二元七角原盤、後者仍為二元六角、軍用票需要奇殷、晚市高至三元六角、</p>
<h3>大戶逢低加碼　不使紗市過跌</h3>
<p>紗市始疲繼昂、但趨勢稍見安靜、此因多頭方面準備收貨、至於空頭亦有扒補之意、於是檯面鬆中帶緊、大戶購進之貨、仍無放棄之念逢低續來加碼、所以行情立定一步也、二十支雙馬高介為二千四百四十元、低價為二千三百六十五元、午後因週尾關係、向例</p>
<p>雙馬晨開形勢平澹、首盤價為二千四百十元、此盤一開、塲中賣戶衆多、市盤直下至二千三百六十五元、此時黃金亦挫、不料取引所紗布開盤、下跌程度未見劇烈、人心帶好一步、同時大戶收進、於是空頭亦活動扒補、市盤乃徐徐回昂至二千四百四十元收盤、查半日間成交統計二千八百五十包、</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、經十一月份交割後、昨又開始交易、而市氣由疲轉挺、起伏達七八十元至百餘元之多、當晨初開出時、先因傳說美日間之談判、形勢似轉不佳、一般人心顧忌、不免有杞人之愛、故廠單首先下墮、乃一度降至二三六五·〇〇低價、期紗憑藉萎頓、金號與證券幫先後吐出、十二月份會以之千三百五十元低價做開、一月份為二千四百七十元開盤、亦曾軋小至二千四百五十元、二月份幾近低盤為二千五百二十元、入後以金市轉硬、現紗亦徘徊上游、人心穩定、買方吸收突又見勁、各月期先後上升、近期步高至二四五〇·〇〇、一月期亦上升至二五三〇·〇〇、二月份升達二五八〇·〇〇、其翻雲覆雨之勢、完全為金市與廠單所繫、其實目下紗市走勢、乃係跟隨一般人心之注目國際局勢、而其根實為銀根之緊縮與押款之關係、據傳紗市之成本、寶高於現市價有三四百元之多、故由於此層、做空者不免亦有顧忌、而多方則為局勢與銀根所阻、其潛力不免减弱、觀其走勢、若銀根與環象稍能鬆弛、乃變遷自必迅速下午週六無市、茲列表於後</p>
<p>現棉情况依然停頓、廠方因紗市不振、無胃收辦、同業以年關將屆、亦束手傍觀、大家待機、再決輸贏也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、晨初先因同業買進、及經紀商買進而漲、續後又因南方幫套賣及獲利了結而回跌、昨日收盤價格較之上日約跌三四磅因左右、</p>
<p>印度棉市交易稀少、同時因有棉商不斷套賽、及投機者售出而略疲、昨日收盤價格、各跌二三羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况、繼續看小半羅比左右、</p>
<h3>統制物價之體要</h3>
<p>— 傑克</p>
<p>綜觀自十一月以來，工部局對於物價所實施，約可分為兩端：（甲）為統制辦法，又分三項：　對於米·麵·煤·油四項日用必需品之統制，　核准進口商協會所評定洋貨·藥品等之限價，　危險液體及物質囤積之取締。前兩項實施現狀，關於必需品，則米之統制最為嚴密，如售米處之設立，限制貨量，調查囤積，禁止私運；麵粉則正由禁運以至調查，及籌集資金購粉平售；至於食油則僅在招商承辦訂購而謀統制其售價；煤則僅在調查下業用煤情形。（乙）為統制技術，則有　零售物品設置標籤之規定，　進貨售貨及存貨記錄之查核。</p>
<p>吾人分析工部局所採之統制物價政策，計有下列四型式：一為半價購銷，如必需品米·麵·粉·油煤之措施；二為限定價格，如洋貨·食物·藥品等限價之公布；三為限量購買，如食米每人一斗之限制；四為取締國積，如米·麵之登記，危險液體及物質領照儲藏之規定。雖然；運輸艱困，資金短細，康購賤銷，殊難見效，此平價　銷之不易也。供求均衡，物價自平，强定限似，流弊斯生，此限定價格之不易也。調查統計，舞劃佈置，苟有不遂，即難成功，此限量購買之不易也。幣値下降，物價上昇，保財圖利，人之恒情，此取締囤積之不易也。若再體制不備，組織不嚴，策劃不週，實行不力，結果，效未見而弊已生，價未半而法已弛。如今日限價之品，經售商店，譬言無貨，拒不出售。又如限量之米，謀利奸民，腰纏纍纍，私運出界。夫限價之品，並不缺貨，限量之米，數僅一斗，其弊如此，他無論矣。</p>
<p>工部局情報處蓋嘗言之：為謀物資輸入之均衡，合理價格之供給，擬即覓取平準基金委員會，各輪船公司以及各國商務官員之合作：此平價購銷之前提也。又云：官定價格，不得超過，倘有違犯，常予懲處；同時進口商協會會員，亦將拒絕以共經營貨物，繼續供給　違犯之人；此限定價格之支柱也。復謂：必要之時，自行零售，將來對於購貨者，給以身份證明卡紙，並採計口分配辦法；此限量購買之基礎也。更稱：貨物供應，限於急需，倘屬可能，容器應予屬啓，標籤應行移去；而進口商分配新貨以前，或將收回舊容器及舊標籤；此取締囤積之要件也。故今日工部局統制物償，務期弊絕而效著，法嚴而價平，不擾民而有惠民之實，懲囤積而無侵犯應有之存貨，是固得為政之體耍也。</p>
<h3>內債平穩</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市極為平穩、更以週六關關係交易甚少、趨勢仍係恍惚不定狀况、各種公債之漲跌頗有參差不同、多空雙方均在有所期待、各有目標、暫時恐仍未必有鉅大上落也、昨為週六於上午十一時開盤、祇倣一盤、空方壓力仍覺比較為重、丙種開獲後曾高至八元七角、但未能立定、乙種散戶零星需耍較多、故比衆獨優、買戶祇潤德及益記吸收稍跌、賣方以鼎康及同康為夥、市價結果除丁種未有做開及甲種絕無高低外、其他三種亦復參差不一、成交總數約計六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股、一百股、價為每股六十元正、</p>
<h3>西棧粉獨疲　粳米連連報跌</h3>
<p>洋粉自北消停頓後、市形益形無神、本街雖有需買、而執貨者心虛胆怯、多主貶價早脫、尤以西棧登記之進口粉為疲、昨日曾議西棧金龍為三十五元之價、則巳接近平價公賣價矣、惟小麥棧存久枯、新到不繼、偶有到貨仍圖扳守、故杜客麥仍站在七十二三元間、麩皮有內地鄉莊去化、小包麩皮又見微站、價開五十六元云、</p>
<p>洋麫粉北運不巳、連日運津者、已屢誌本報、茲悉今日怡和洋行日陞輪赴津、除運去大宗洋米砂糖外、又有大量洋麪粉四萬三千三百包、運往天津、</p>
<p>洋米繼續到埠、怡和洋行日陞輪昨晨抵滬、由香港裝來洋米五千零七十二包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、另有洋米八千三百四十一包、定今日原船運津、又在本市加裝二千包運津、（祖）</p>
<p>昨洋米仍乏市面、國米到頭漸旺、昨由小販搬到南北粳及尖元米三四百包、而實銷納胃不加成交不足半數、因此更尖元各米盡見冉小二三元、崑山新粳自一百八十元至一百七十五元、靑泗薄稻一百七十一元至一百七十元、杜尖一百六十四元、陰元一百八十元云、</p>
<h3>雜糧漲多跌少</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市况、食油初因浮囤亟脫而見挫、卒受業中人吸購回漲、結果與前軒輊互有、略有二三元參差、黃豆因本客走銷活潑而見轉升二三元、苞米亦以囤買不弱趨昂一二元、統市售開大運豆油一百餘桶、江北生油十桶、又二百聽、日華廠菜油五百擔、天津新金元一千包、又靑豆四百包、苞米現貨二千包、期貨三百餘噸、</p>
<h3>糖市無大軒輊</h3>
<p>昨為週六以聯營公司交割、期貨停市、僅成交現貨三千餘包、趨勢平穩、無大軒輊、公會劃盤、二四粗白本月份者上午開二百〇二元、至〇四元、下午二百〇三元半、結果仍以二百〇四元、收盤十月份者上午二百元、至〇一元、下午一盤、為二百〇二元、九月份一百九十六元、港粗一百七十一元至七十五元、太古（車白DY）嘜一百七十七元、HX嘜一百七十六元、荷赤現貨一百六十八元、至六十九元半、下午開好一元為一百七十元〇五角、路貨做一百七十三元半、</p>
<p>渣華公司芝沙力號輪、昨晨抵埠、由爪哇裝來砂糖六千噸、計六萬包、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭起卸、又怡和洋行日陞輪、由本市裝榶二千一百八十包、運往天津、</p>
<h3>烟煤一落千丈　煤商自食其果</h3>
<p>煤業市塲、近日自白煤新貨裝到以後、經理行家巳照常發售、市塲暗盤、無形消滅、囤戶老單、爭求出籠、致烟煤亦大受刺激、立起回風、一落千丈、印度烟煤立進八百元關、後市祇開七白二十元、開平煤亦跟縱直下、塊做六百五十元、較前大跌去白餘元盤子，物極必反、盛極必衰、天理循環、可稱絲毫不爽、爬得高、跌得痛、煤商自食其果、</p>
<h3>相思豆無甚用</h3>
<p>相思豆一名赤小豆、邇來到存均稀、但此物除藥材中有幫要外、其餘僅糕糧店中作為粉物中之眼睛等用景極微、故市價未能過昂、昨市行盤售二百元、比前漲起有限云、</p>

<h3>讀書之道</h3>
<p>— 靑爭</p>
<p>談到「讀書」兩字，我們先該明瞭究竟為何要讀書？一般的人，往往祗知「死讀」，而不能了解它的眞理。現在我來槪括地說一句：讀是是為了學做人的道理。也有人以為讀了書是用來做大官發大財的，其實不對；記得曾國藩諭紀鴻兒的書信中有：「……我不願你做大官，但願為讀書明理的君子。……切不可貪愛奢華……。」等語（由此可以知道讀書為的不是個人的富貴享樂，而是使社會國家得到一些貢獻。</p>
<p>至於讀書應抱何種態度？我以為首先該使身心專一，譬如現在作文，那末我的心裏，祗在思想怎麼寫文章，別的一切都不管；俗語「一心不得二用」，否則就是不專心，用作讀書做事也都一樣。假使不專心讀書，那末這課書等於「白讀；」緣他心不曾收得，何能領會得書？其次，不可自以為太聰明，朱子說：「緣他先有一副當聖賢意思，自是難入。」讀書更應該有耐久性，假使讀一課書，讀了許久，還不能理會它的眞意，無耐久性的，索性不高興讀了；或者讀了一時，便去玩耍，玩了一時，復來讀書；這種都是無益可得。</p>
<p>讀書若要理會它的眞意，應有上面所說的幾種熊度，細細的多看幾遍，摘出其中的精華，牢牢記住；不要讀得太多後，反而不易了解其所以然。所以讀書不在多，而在能理會書中的精意。</p>
<p>也有人讀書讀不好，就此灰心。我想若是照上面的道理去讀，無論如何，終能成功！因為「失敗是成功之母！」</p>
<h3>喝水的美國人</h3>
<p>— 禮義</p>
<p>解放黑奴的美國總統林肯，年輕時非常困苦，他有一次到英國一個印刷所裏去工作，全所五十多個工人，差不多個個人喜歡喝啤酒，早餐前，早餐時，早餐後，午餐時，晚餐時，晚餐後，每日要喝好幾頓；但林肯，他一些不喝，祗喝些白開水，而他的工作效能，反比旁人大，上下樓梯，左右手都拿鉛字，他人却辦不到了。因此，大家羣呼他「喝開水的美國人。」旁的工人們，常因喝酒過度，負債不少，薪金一到手便化光，後來甚至酒店裏也不允賒欠酒錢了，於是不得不轉請林背去担保賒買。林背旣一些不浪費他的薪金，加以又有卓著的信用，工人們這纔續有嘗到酒味的機會；而林肯遂在每星期六發薪時，當塲扣取各工人酒錢，拿來還給酒店，一點不含糊。所以後來這喝水的美國人，在全印刷所中，被經理認為是最可重用的工人，一切趕印的文件，都命他担任，因為他不但比別人做得好，而且做得快，薪金也自然特別地高，林肯的生活情形，於是遂漸漸良好了！</p>
<p>小朋友！耐苦是成功的第一要件，偉人們沒有一個不是從困苦中奮鬥出來的，你們看了林肯的軼事，應該如何勉勵奮發呢！</p>
<h3>一年凍死三萬人</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>小朋友們，這一個驚人的數字，也許我不提起，你們是不會知道的吧？在上海這個都巿裏面，大概一年要凍死三萬人，眞是一件駭人聽聞的事。而且在這三萬個凍死的人們之中，兒童的數字，也佔有不少。也許要近萬呢！</p>
<p>我們走到街頭，每天可以看到有凍死的人，躺在馬路旁邊，慘不忍覩。這裏面，有男，有女，有老，有小，雖然有的是因病而死，但凍死的却居其大半。這些人，都無家可歸，無處訴苦的。為了吃白麵，不學好，走向墮落的途徑，死不足惜者，當然未始沒有，可是這種人畢竟祇有一小部分啊</p>
<p>就是大人可不去管他們，但孩子們心地純潔，總不見得也吃白麵吧？那麽每天有不少孩子因受飢寒所迫而死在馬路上面，豈不是無辜　殃，而値得我們表示同情的嗎？因此這個問題，也不容我們忽視呢！</p>
<p>兒童是未來的國家主人翁，這些無辜受凍而死在馬路上的孩子裏，未始沒有富有天才，將來可以造就的。所以今日的兒童多枉死一個，就使他日國家多損失一分元氣，無論站在同情的觀點上，國家的觀點上，我們對於這麼多枉死的兒童，不能坐視，應設法使其减少才是。</p>
<p>上面的數字，由專門收取街頭屍體的慈善機關普善山莊統計而得，自必相當的正確。而且就往年的情形說來，一到冬天，死的人愈多。發一個冷頭，總要死去不少人，現在，冬天又來了，寒冷也正不住的襲擊我們，為飢寒而凍死的孩子，當然要跟着天氣的寒冷程度而增加。如果不願使兒童們這樣的枉死，除了希望慈善機關多多救濟外，還得望每一個小朋友，能够節省些糖果費來救濟這班苦孩子。枉死的兒童少一個好一個，那麼不但救難，簡直也可算救國呢！</p>
<h3>改良烘山芋</h3>
<p>— 織</p>
<p>現在我要和諸位小朋友談的，是一個吃的問題，就是「改良烘山芋」，什麽叫做「改良烘山芋」呢？這是我所發明的，聽我慢慢講來吧！</p>
<p>烘山芋是充滿現在長街短巷的流行的食品，又香，又甜，又鬆，又軟，更含有一種不注意的引誘力，就是它的熱烘烘，所以天冷吃起來頂嶄。可惜價値太貴了，小的一隻要賣一角，大一些的就得二三角，至於生的山芋，那祗要八九角就好買一斤，所以頂好自己會烘。但我烘過幾次的結果，多是烘不透，如果時間想供得長一些，那末半生牛熟的外皮巳焦得不能再吃了，於是我亟欲得個自烘山芋的妙法，結果總算圓滿了。</p>
<p>其法：就是把洗淸的山芋放到鍋裏，像煮湯山芋一樣的去煮，煮到山芋全部熟了，（不要太穌穌則皮容易脫）再拿出來用鉛絲夾放在爐子上去烘乾，烘到皮像外面　的烘山芋的皮形狀一樣就成功了。小朋友們，你想多麼經濟便當啊！此外有二點要你們附帶注意：　做的時候當心爐火灼痛你的小手　做成後把好的大的先給爸爸媽媽嘗</p>
<h3>冷的現象</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>氣候隨着樹業的凋萎而日漸寒冷，刮了一整天的西北風，陰沈的空中，密佈了一層烏雲，一絲陽光也不能透射出來，於是使寒暑表的水銀柱突然的降低到四五十度左右；離開冰點僅有十多度了，冷的現象也充分地表現出，因此在每個人的嘴裏吐出來的氣，竟變成了白色；阿慰家裏的自來水管便用稻草包紮起來；庭園裏的樹葉都一片片飄下來，但是松樹的葉仍舊是綠緣地，一些也沒有怕冷的樣子；阿慰在上學去的時候，看見路旁的乞丐在發抖呻吟着…這種種特殊的景象，在阿慰的眼前出演着，而在腦中問着「為什麼？」他想來想去，自己不能回答，只得去請敎他的哥哥，最是方便。</p>
<p>「一到冬天，我們嘴裏呼出來的氣，為什麼會變白色？這因為氣候一寒冷，溫度當然是比了我們身體的溫度更來得低，而嘴裏呼出來的氣體裏面，大部是水蒸汽，如一碰到了外面的冷空氣；便凝結起來，變成了霧，所以看上去是白色的。自來水管為什麼要用稻草來包紮？天氣的溫度一降到華氏三十二度，凡是水都要結冰，露在空氣中的自來水管裏面，總有水存在的，那知水在水管裏結冰的時候，便要膨脹起來，况且這種膨脹力又是很大的，要是水管裏充滿了水，把水管一脹就脹碎了，所以一到冷天，便要用稻草來包紮，這因為稻草是不傳冷熱的東西，包在水管外面，空氣的寒冷不能使水管裏的水結冰，水管也不致脹碎了。其他的樹都要落葉，但是松樹為什麼不會落葉？松樹的葉子所含的成分，和其他落葉樹的樹業沒有什麽不同，它所以會不落葉，這因為松樹葉的皮比了其他的樹葉來得粘結堅韌一些，所以能够在冬天也是碧綠的。在冷天不要說乞丐要發抖，就是我們也會發抖，這為什麽？要知道這是一種白然的動作，在寒冷發抖的時候！可以使我們身體的肌肉發生運動，同時又可以使身體裏面血液，運行的速度加快，隨着身體便可溫暖起來，這種發抖正和手冷時把兩隻手搓搓或是起身跳跳，而使身體溫暖是同樣的道理，路傍乞丐的發抖，那是沒有厚衣服穿，更沒有熱東西吃的緣故啊！」阿慰的哥哥把他的四個「為什麼？」一一的解決了。他的心裏當然是非常的感激，不過沒有說出來罷了。</p>
<h3>洞中盲魚</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>兩星期前，筆者參與華東浸禮敎會禮拜，那天是張春江先生負責佈道。他曾引了一段自己當年在美國留學時的往事，借之以勉勵我們無論在求學時代或者是巳踏入了社會後，對於凡事都應該抱一種奮鬥不懈的精神。他說：「一天當我跟了幾個朋友在美國某地旅行，忽而我們進入了一個深邃的山洞，洞內是漆黑一片，陽光是永遠照不到這一角的。洞下有小池一方，池內有幾條小魚往來游着，很奇怪的，我定睛一看，發現這幾條魚的眼睛竟沒有一條是不盲的。</p>
<p>「為什麼這幾條魚的眼睛是沒有一條不盲的？」張先生要我們思量一下。「當然是因為日處於黑暗的環境下，眼睛的功用巳經日漸消失，結果就有這種現象。」</p>
<p>小朋友！張先生的一番叙述是給我們一個極大的敎訓。如果我們的腦子一天不用，結果與洞中的盲魚會有什麼兩樣呢？</p>
<p>小朋友！請你們把黑點的地方用筆塗黑，就成一幅畫。</p>

<h3>影星的機會與成敗</h3>
<p>— 益凡</p>
<p>凡百游藝，欲求進步，第一要有人材，和訓練人材的方法，這在電影事業尤覺重要。譬如說美國，不知成千成萬的人希望故做星，而結果希望往往變成了夢想。　米高梅影片公司有一位著名的智力　騐　愛德華加利奧語人：當選明星，和明星的成敗，機會是很要緊的，（機會猶之我國的命運之說）他舉出以下幾位大明星　例：</p>
<p>茂娜洛埃：在未成名之前，是一個起碼脚色。直到有一個新導演發覺她臉蛋兒有天然的美，而行動自然，被他看中了，因此一帆風順，得有今日的地位。</p>
<p>安秀　丹是出名的「晤」女郎了，她的成名是靠着一個新聞記者發明一個OOMPH的新字。</p>
<p>桃樂珊拉摩是怎樣成名的呢？當舉行明星測騐的時候，導演突然停止　騐其他女演員而特別注視人羣中的桃小姐，她因此聲名雀起，紅運高照。</p>
<p>好萊塢明星考試主考者鑒於正面測騐，未必盡善，另有一旁敲側擊的方法，也發掘不少的　人村。</p>
<p>泰羅鮑華，宋雅海妮，都是初試失敗之成名者。蓓蒂格蘭寶在未入廿世紀幅斯公司前，曾應考兩家影片公司而失敗，林達黛妮兒經考試後一年，方被導演所識拔，可見影城電影明星的升沉，雖然看他演技的高低和體態的美醜，而命運的休咎，也是重要的關鍵</p>

        <h1>1941.11.30</h1>
<h3>Seeking Lasting Pacific Peace, U.S. Position Unwavering: Believes Japan's Actions Are Identical to Hitler's; No Compromise Unless Japanese Troops Withdraw from China and Vietnam</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 29th—Yesterday, the United States strongly adopted an unshakeable position regarding the sharp crisis in the Far East, insisting on maintaining the status quo and eliminating Japan's influence in China and Vietnam. The most reliable political figures say that the continuation of peace in the Pacific depends entirely on whether Japan can accept the United States' guidance at the final moment to achieve this process. The highest levels of government state that regarding the China issue, there is absolutely no room for compromise. This move shatters Japan's hopes of establishing a temporary agreement, maintaining its current gains, and guaranteeing no new aggression. At the same time, President Roosevelt stated that the Japanese envoy Kurusu has not yet brought Tokyo's reply regarding the United States' position on the Pacific. Senior government officials are comparing Japan's current actions in the Far East with those of the German army in invading countries such as Romania and Hungary before attacking Greece. These officials say that the United States is still willing to prove that the goal of the Japanese military's actions is not to do so, so that the door to further negotiations remains open. President Roosevelt indicated that he might meet with the Japanese envoys again, but said he had no definite appointment date. It is widely believed that the US government believes that a Japanese invasion of Thailand or Yunnan-Burma Road would pose two threats to the United States: it would threaten the source of key raw materials and threaten President Roosevelt's lend-lease policy to China. Well-informed sources say that the lend-lease policy will definitely be implemented, even if it means resorting to force. They point out that President Roosevelt, in his recent speech, guaranteed to deliver raw materials to China and Britain, and it is widely believed that his speech had no reservations. According to the most reliable information obtained yesterday, whether peace can continue in the Pacific depends on whether Japan can agree to the United States' advice at the final moment to withdraw all troops from China and temporarily maintain the status quo in other parts of the Far East. However, the most reliable sources say that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are still seeking a so-called temporary maintenance of the status quo. These officials also say that this matter does not affect the United States' fundamental policy towards China and Vietnam, and that the United States insists that Japan must immediately cease its aggression against China and other Far Eastern countries, and there is absolutely no room for compromise on this point. What will Tokyo's response be to the strong notification from the United States? This is being awaited here, but it is not known whether the wording of Tokyo's reply will leave room for further negotiations, or whether Japan will proceed with its long-planned further aggression. They also say that, studied from a map, the current situation of Japan's invasion of China and Vietnam already threatens the Philippines and other Far Eastern interests of the United States. The threat of Japan's southward advance to the Philippines is tantamount to completing its horseshoe-shaped encirclement of the Philippines. It is indicated here that the United States is determined to resist this threat, but the decision on war or peace rests with Tokyo. Since April of this year, the United States has drafted a framework for a peaceful resolution, which includes the restoration of normal economic relations in the Far East if the Sino-Japanese war can be resolved fairly, and all countries will have the right to obtain raw materials. It is said that Secretary of State Hull is conducting negotiations with a patient attitude, but Japan is sending an expeditionary force to Vietnam at this time, which makes US officials feel deeply that Japan's method is parallel and similar to that previously adopted by Hitler. The continuous entry of Japanese troops into Vietnam is no different from the previous actions of the Nazis in occupying Czechoslovakia and other European countries. Senior officials also say that Japan's military horseshoe shape surrounds the Philippines, and the United States has to recognize that Japan's invasion of Vietnam and other Far Eastern countries is a direct threat to the United States' territorial interests, not only to the Philippines, but also to the entire Pacific.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th—"The Baltimore Sun" has the words that the American people must prepare for war with Japan. Today's Washington sentiment can indeed be fully summarized by this sentence. However, this is also like President Roosevelt's answer yesterday when a reporter asked whether the situation in the Pacific would worsen: it is a question that Japan should answer. Whether Japan will go to war with the United States is determined only by Tokyo. Currently, Japan has three possible paths: agree to the key points of the United States' long-standing position in the East; remain hesitant and uncertain while economic restrictions weaken its strength; make a desperate struggle. The Washington Post says that Kurusu's mission is to see if the United States is bluffing. Key figures in Washington have now made it clear that the United States does not want to change its position on China in the slightest. Non-official observers with experience in the Far East here mostly hold the view that the Japanese warlords cannot withdraw from China while still holding great power in Japan, nor can they remain inactive, causing Japan to fall into bankruptcy due to economic restrictions. To speculate, they would rather fail honorably at the hands of the United States and others, so that they can still maintain their political power at home.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Japanese Troops in Vietnam; Extreme Anxiety in Thailand</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 29th—Reuters has learned from extremely reliable sources that, according to reports received, the reinforcement of Japanese troops landing in Vietnam in the past few days is a sign that Secretary of State Hull has suspended the Washington talks. This reinforcement of Japanese troops is mainly composed of aircraft, and there are also a number of infantry and artillery units that have recently landed in Saigon. However, it is still doubtful whether the exact number of Japanese troops in Vietnam today has exceeded 50,000 or 60,000. About a month ago, Japan had only about 100 aircraft in Vietnam. It is widely believed that in recent days, the number of aircraft has increased to at least 500. Most parts of Vietnam were still waterlogged a month ago, but after the monsoon rains stopped, the Japanese have hired a large number of Vietnamese workers to improve and expand the airport sites. Well-informed sources here still feel that Japan has not yet reached the stage of taking immediate action against Thailand, but its preparations seem to be quite advanced at present. If a lightning offensive by land, sea, and air and the fifth column is decided to be launched against Bangkok, the date will not be far off. The Japanese only need to continue to send a small number of aircraft and troops and transfer warships from Hainan Island to the Gulf of Siam to launch a surprise attack, which is enough to give Bangkok a fatal blow. However, conquering or occupying the interior of Thailand will be another matter. The interior of Thailand is full of mountains and dense forests. The troops required for the Japanese to carry out this military operation may be greatly increased compared to those currently prepared across the border. However, on the Japanese side, they may think that before the ABCD countries decide what action to take and before the naval reinforcements promised by the British Prime Minister can arrive in large numbers, a rapid attack on Bangkok will also be a necessary means to seize the essence of Thailand. This possibility cannot be ruled out, so there is reason to believe that the Japanese military will think that if they take the above-mentioned strategy with rapid and effective means, they may be able to avoid military disputes with the ABCD countries.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York, 29th—According to reports from the United Kingdom, the Thai government has sent a military delegation to Singapore to hold a meeting with the British authorities there.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 29th—Japanese dignitaries in Vietnam all say that whether the tense situation in the Far East can be eased depends entirely on the outcome of the Washington conference. Many parties here believe that the situation has reached the most serious point, so they are paying great attention to the news coming from Washington. The non-official information from New York that the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam is the main position of the United States is published in large characters in Vietnamese newspapers, and readers are temporarily relieved. However, seeing that the Japanese preparations in Vietnam continue unabated, they feel that Japan may not be willing to accept this request. Although some well-informed people believe that Japan does not have the spare strength to launch a major foreign war, the value of the Thai army is a complete mystery. It is only known that the Thai army has some new equipment. The Japanese army has been at war for a long time and is facing a terrain extremely favorable for attack. The outcome is not difficult to predict. And the United Kingdom and the United States have not yet given Thailand a special military guarantee to back up Thailand when it is invaded by a third country. People here cannot help but be surprised. Is it that the ABCD powers are only satisfied with preserving their own final defense line, and the invasion of Thailand may not be a sign of a major war? It is expected that the only effective weapon given to Thailand by the democratic countries is aircraft. Thailand may be able to win with this, because it is said that the aircraft in the ABCD Far East defense are indeed superior to the Japanese aircraft. As for Vietnam, it is heard that it will remain neutral in the Far East war, but since one of the belligerent countries has taken Vietnam as its starting point for operations, it goes without saying that neutrality cannot protect Vietnamese industries.</p>
<h3>Determined to Resist Aggression, Australia and Burma Are Prepared for Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>United Press International, New York, 29th—CBS learned from Australian broadcasting yesterday that the Australian War Advisory Committee, after studying diplomatic intelligence from Washington, Tokyo, and London, has approved Prime Minister Curtin's proposed declaration of Australian war policy. It is understood that Curtin's statement is consistent with the previous declaration of Pacific policy. According to the previous statement, it is solemnly pointed out that Australia is extremely willing to maintain peace, but the country will also resist aggression, and its self-defense strength is also very strong.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 29th—Today, the Governor of Burma issued a proclamation authorizing the Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese Army to command the Burmese Border Force in order to achieve the effect of unified command. It is generally believed that this measure is an important step in Burma's preparations to resist aggression. The Burmese Border Force has many regiments, all of whom have received excellent training in border military operations and have excellent service records. The ground defense of various airports in Burma is actually the responsibility of the army. The Burmese government also announced its decision to establish an organization based on the whole of Burma, with full power to obtain the main food supply and control its distribution. The detailed measures are currently being drafted urgently.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Economically Restricting Japan, Will Implement a Comprehensive Blockade</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th—The Times correspondent in Washington discussed the recent developments in US-Japan relations, saying that the current question is whether Japan intends to attack Thailand or Yunnan Province, or both. Some people in Washington believe that if Japan has this intention, its reply to the US document on Wednesday evening may be delayed until the military action is already underway. At the same time, another part of the people say that the current economic restrictions on Japan may be immediately expanded into a comprehensive economic blockade, and no advance warning will be given. If the final provocation is indeed added to the United States, it can be asserted that it will be accepted, because any other approach will not only affect the Pacific, but also Europe. The American people, even those in the Midwest states, will be deeply shocked if they see that the country they currently deeply suspect is now allowed to get its way.</p>
<h3>Germany Promises Military Assistance; Japan Expects Something</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 29th—Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Ottawa, Idaho, said today that he had learned from reliable non-official sources that Hitler had promised to provide Japan with huge military assistance in February of next year, and that by January of next year, Vichy would be forced to hand over its fleet to Japan. These officials also said that Japan hopes that the Soviet war will end soon. Gillette believes that US-Japan negotiations are unlikely to reach an agreement except perhaps to establish a delayed truce. Gillette said that Kurusu's visit to the United States was to delay waiting for German assistance for Japan to attack Thailand and the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th—When local authorities commented on rumors that the United States had decided to set up aerial patrols in the airspace over the Burma Road, they said that this action would be considered a direct hostile act and one of the most provocative armed aggressions on the part of the ABCD front. The Japan Advertiser also commented on the claim that democratic countries had notified Thailand to protect its neutrality, saying that if the meaning of this move is to send occupying forces into Thailand, it will create a very serious situation.</p>
<h3>British Sea Minister Warns Japan It Is Not Too Late to Turn Back from the Brink</h3>
<p>Reuters, Blackpool, 29th—Sea Minister Alexander mentioned the Pacific issue in a speech at the opening ceremony of Blackpool Warship Week today, saying that in the Far East, we are witnessing Japan, an old ally, now hovering on the edge of making a big mistake if it takes a wrong step. Japanese leaders have often claimed that the country is now at a crossroads, but who has led it to this position? The goodwill and cooperation of the United States and us are always listening to Japan's dispatch along the road of reason and peace. In fact, it is its warlords who have led Japan to its current predicament. I believe that many wise men in Japan can see the advantages and disadvantages, and I believe that some of its leaders will give wise advice and will not bear to let it fall into the abyss. If Japan is prepared to cooperate with the forces of justice and reason, then no one can doubt that a great and glorious destiny is waiting to come to it in East Asia. Alexander also said that what Japan can expect from Hitler is nothing other than what Italy has encountered. Hitler will use Japan to advance his evil plans, and once the goal is achieved, he will abandon it regardless. Alexander finally said that the British Navy has repeatedly broken the enemy's prestige at sea in order to enable large-scale troops to be equipped and supplied for thousands of miles of transportation by sea, and its achievements are still indelible.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th—It is learned from reliable sources that the United States has indeed eliminated the possibility of compromise with Japan on the China issue, and then the issue of arming US ships in the Pacific has arisen. The White House said yesterday that US ships in the Pacific will not be armed in the current environment. President Roosevelt said at a press conference, in response to a question on how long the current environment can be maintained, that the question should be answered by Tokyo. The President also said that negotiations with Japan have not broken down, but he may leave the hot springs before Monday due to the Japanese situation.

<h3>The Tone of the Eastern Newspaper Shows Pessimism; The Attitude of the United States Is Firm; Negotiations Are Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 29th—Japanese newspapers today continued to express pessimism about the Washington talks, which were temporarily suspended to await Japan's reply to the United States. "Asahi Shimbun" said in a special editorial that negotiations cannot be successful unless the United States abandons its basic principles, and stated that negotiations must be based on reality. At the same time, the newspaper published on the cover a photo of the Japanese fleet issued by the Naval Inspection Department. The purpose of publishing the photo was to show that the Japanese Navy can absolutely protect the Pacific. "Asahi Shimbun" also said that Japan will still do its utmost "until the very last minute" to maintain peace in the Pacific. The newspaper concluded, "The environment around Japan has become so tense that Japan is unwilling to waste any more time on negotiations." "Mainichi Shimbun" said that if the United States is overly confident in its national strength and insists that Japan accept its views, "then Japan will have to suspend the current negotiations and take the necessary steps as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in New York Prepare to Withdraw Completely; Japanese Banks and Companies Have Stopped Doing Business One After Another</h3>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 29th—"Asahi Shimbun" recently published a telegram from a correspondent in New York saying that the US-Japan relations are serious. The Japanese residents who were affected by the freezing order and remained decided to leave the United States and will return home by ship on December 14. All Japanese banks and companies in New York will only leave one or two responsible personnel. All Japanese clubs and societies in the area will be closed.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 29th—Reuters learned from Japanese leaders that Japanese banks in New York intend to close down. They are now preparing to transfer their remaining business to Yokohama Specie Bank, which will be left here alone. At this time, the New York managers of various Japanese banks are just as unsure of the final outcome of the current tense situation between the United States and Japan as others. A manager told people that he was afraid to read the newspaper. The first to plan to stop business is Mitsui Bank, and at least four others will follow suit. Of course, the closure of Japanese banks is in line with the tense stage of US-Japan talks.</p>

<h3>British Troops Occupy Gondar; East African Italian Empire Collapses; The Number of Blackshirts Who Surrendered Is Difficult to Estimate; The Red Sea Passage Is More Stable From Now On</h3>
<p>United Press International, London, 29th—British troops occupied Gondar yesterday. This British victory completely disintegrated the East African Empire created by Mussolini. In addition, the British army has lifted any threats to the British army's positions in Egypt and Sudan and its rear, and the situation of the Red Sea passage, the necessary route for American supplies to the Middle East, is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th—The War Office issued a statement on the Gondar campaign, stating that the military operation in Gondar was of a blocking nature, and the patriotic soldiers led by British officers undertook a large part of the mission. There were few large-scale battles, but the patrols were quite active, driving the enemy into a more and more narrow area and forcing them to surrender. On November 20, the area occupied by the troops under Italian General Vassi was still sixteen miles long from north to south and forty miles wide from east to west, but he had withdrawn from Gondar and declared the city an undefended city. The number of Italian troops stationed there who have now surrendered is difficult to estimate, because there are quite a few who have been killed or wounded and have deserted. The Italian army there originally had nine battalions of Blackshirts, the 4th Brigade of the Colonial Army, and a part of the 22nd Brigade of the Colonial Army. General Vassi's air force had only one fighter and one bomber left. The South African Air Force was responsible for assisting in the battle throughout the campaign. The British commander of Gondar is Major General Fox, 46 years old.</p>

<h3>Reports to Various Government Ministries: Matters Requiring Attention from the Political Council (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Internal Affairs</p>
<p>The powers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs seem inadequate, making active management difficult. It is proposed that the government consider increasing the powers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Furthermore, all matters of an internal affairs nature should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The financial and human resources of the counties are insufficient, making it difficult to implement the new county system with six or seven departments uniformly established. When approving the organization of each county, the Ministry of Internal Affairs should pay close attention. The selection of township and village heads, as well as heads of Baojia (local security units), is often unqualified. County governments should be ordered to carefully select and appoint qualified individuals. The concurrent appointment of unqualified township heads as elementary school principals has a very negative impact on education. The regulation requiring concurrent appointments need not be strictly adhered to. The relationship between the police and the people is the closest. Special attention should be paid to moral education, "understanding propriety, righteousness, and integrity, bearing responsibility, and observing discipline," in order to reform the police administration. Each county should strictly order local governments to expand warehouses and effectively manage accumulated grain reserves. The opium ban has reached the final prohibition stage. Existing anti-smoking agencies should be strengthened, funding should be increased, rewards and punishments should be strictly enforced, and the ban should be thoroughly and completely implemented in accordance with the original plan.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>Regarding the state of revenues and expenditures, efforts should be made to seek a balance. When opening up new sources of revenue, close attention should be paid to whether the increased taxes hinder production or affect the minimum living standards of the people. Whether the tax revenue expenses, including anti-smuggling administrative costs, are too large, thereby reducing income. Revenue should be collected according to the principle of "those with more money contribute more," and fair collection policies should be sought to remedy financial difficulties. The government should pay more attention to cost-cutting measures, and stop things that have little effect and are not needed. Unnecessary agencies should be abolished as much as possible. All expenditures, whether central or local, should be based on the principle of having a significant impact on the war effort. Reforming the tax system, adopting a monopoly system, and issuing public bonds for goods must have appropriate institutions and personnel to cooperate in order to be effective. Budget preparation is the foundation of finance, and implementing the budget is the first condition for sound finances. The Ministry of Finance should, based on the first principle of the war effort, take on the responsibility of preparing and executing the budget. Regarding the control of finance, the current foreign exchange control situation has obviously improved compared to the past, but efforts are still needed to eliminate the black market. Regarding foreign exchange requests, whether for the government or merchants, a policy should be established and standards should be strictly defined. With regard to bank lending, policies should be determined, and the use and transfer of idle funds should be reasonably regulated.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>In recent years, telecommunications construction has made considerable progress. Wireless communication equipment should be strengthened as soon as possible to facilitate communication. Civil aviation should be expanded to facilitate travel. Special attention should be paid to safety and management to increase transport effectiveness. In the future, postal transportation services in various locations should be concentrated on automobiles as much as possible. For routes where transportation is inadequate and gasoline supply is more difficult, in addition to these issues, how to strive for self-sufficiency in transportation equipment, how to seek convenience in postal and telecommunications, how to fully utilize waterway transportation, and how to accelerate the development of postal savings and remittance are all urgent tasks. It is hoped that the transportation authorities will take immediate action. As for the engineering, transportation, and management aspects of highways, attention should also be paid to improvement. Efforts should be made to increase the number of vehicles, and thorough unity should be sought in terms of management. Start with internal cooperation within the bureau, and extend to other management agencies to achieve unified policies. Severe measures should be taken to curb driver fraud, and a military organizational structure should be implemented. As for cargo inspection, it should be brief and swift. How to divide and improve passenger and freight, and how to promote the use of non-gasoline vehicles such as coal cars, charcoal cars, and tung oil cars, and how to expand the training of drivers and technicians are all urgent tasks at present. It is hoped that these measures will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The education authorities have been able to diligently advance the facilities and improvements of schools at all levels according to established procedures, which is gratifying. However, the following matters need to be observed and noted: The proportion of education funds in the national general budget is too small. The government should strive to increase it from the 31st year onward under the education funding category, and allocate it strictly to meet actual needs. The implementation of the mutual aid plan for national education over several years, submitted by the government to this council and decided by the Supreme National Defense Council, has recently been rumored to have reduced central subsidies, and there is a tendency to fail to achieve it midway. The government should be requested to implement it earnestly in accordance with the original plan. The treatment of teachers at all levels is meager. During this period of high cost of living, there have been frequent instances of changing professions. Efforts should be made to provide better salaries and subsidies to maintain their livelihoods, so that they can concentrate on their teaching careers. Military training has had little effect since its implementation. The government should be requested to improve it by delineating powers and cultivating teachers. During the five years of war, there has been a lack of domestic materials. In the future, industrial education should be developed in many ways and efforts should be made to enrich it. At the same time, vocational schools should be increased and production education should be earnestly promoted in order to enrich domestic materials and increase combat power. In recent years, unrest has occurred frequently in secondary schools and above. Efforts should be made to correct this to reverse the decline. Township and village heads concurrently serving as principals of national schools are only a temporary expedient. The knowledge and qualifications of the heads of large townships are insufficient to be qualified as principals. Dedicated principals should be the principle. This council also had a resolution at its previous meeting. Improvements should be made as soon as possible in order to complete the national education plan. Private schools often feel that the source of funds is insufficient. The government should provide effective guidance so that they can develop in the same way as public schools.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>In the past year or two, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been engaged in adjusting the provincial enterprises undertaken by various regions to prevent problems before they arise. However, economic facilities must be planned comprehensively with the entire country as the scope to avoid provinces acting on their own and establishing barriers. The industrial and mining enterprises founded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs have made progress in each year. The types, units, and product values have increased annually. In the future, economic facilities should be based on the principle of "building the country through industry" and attention should be paid to the construction of basic industries. It is hoped that the government will find ways to ensure the progress of the industrial and mining production industry. Efforts should be made to improve the technology of exporting minerals to reduce costs. There should also be sound institutions to support this. The management of goods and prices should be reviewed in terms of scope and method. For example, the control of liquid fuels and the supply of cotton yarn and cloth should be made with the greatest effort to regulate the market. The problem of commodity prices should focus on improving transportation, cracking down on hoarding, and adjusting institutions. It is hoped that the government will carefully consider countermeasures to first seek stability and then suppress prices to benefit the people.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>It is hoped that the scope of food control will be gradually and strictly defined. Strict plans should be made and carefully implemented for the collection of land taxes, the purchase of military food, the establishment of warehouses, the implementation and management of the county and township grain storage system, and the training of food personnel. As for the operation of general civilian food, it is hoped that it will be given considerable freedom in order to stimulate production and stabilize its prices. When determining the amount of requisition and purchase, attention should be paid to the psychological response of farmers to this policy and the effectiveness of continued production. In addition, attention should be paid to the fairness of the burden when purchasing grain so as to be fair and equitable. The grain purchase area should not be limited to a local area so that only a portion of the people suffer disadvantages. For hoarding food, the location of grain collection, transportation, and public security should be considered so that it can be quickly supplied in times of food shortage. In the past, the management of food in various provinces was often inappropriate. It is hoped that the Ministry of Food will play a supervisory role in promoting grain administration in various provinces. Regarding food control, it is hoped that the construction of warehouses, the strict design of warehouse management such as ventilation, moisture protection, and rat prevention, and the large-scale preparation of gathering points along rivers and highways will all be handled as soon as possible by hiring experts to carefully consider and implement proper measures.</p>
<p>Agriculture and Forestry</p>
<p>Regarding the grain production increase plan, special attention should be paid to grain-deficient areas. Cotton and hemp production are urgently needed for civilian clothing and military uniforms. Large-scale promotion should be carried out to achieve self-sufficiency. Animal husbandry and fish farming are very important for rural economy and national nutrition. They should be earnestly promoted. Agricultural products that can be exchanged for foreign exchange and wartime resources, such as tung oil, tea leaves, pig bristles, silk, camphor, and anise oil, should all be promoted. Regarding the method of breeding cattle, in addition to encouraging people to increase breeding and implementing a loan plan for plowing cattle, the government should set up farms, breed them on a large scale, distribute them for sale in various places, and pay special attention to protecting plowing cattle, banning the slaughter of plowing cattle, and preventing cattle plague. Other matters, such as the promotion of economic forestry farms, in addition to state-owned ones, efforts should still be made to support the development of private forestry farms. In addition to the current methods of agricultural loans, attention should still be paid to providing loans in kind for plowing cattle, agricultural tools, and seeds. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Key Resolutions of the Provisional Assembly of Fujian</h3>
<p>Yongan. The fifth session of the Provisional Assembly of Fujian opened on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Discusses Recent Situation in Northeast China</h3>
<p>Yulin. Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, recently gave a speech to reporters here, saying that the men of the Northeast Volunteer Army have been fighting bitterly for ten years like one day. The Chinese Volunteer Army in various parts of Northeast China is still striking against the Japanese everywhere. Under the iron heels of the Japanese army, the people of Northeast China hope for the National Army like a severe drought hopes for rain clouds. In addition to seizing Chinese resources, the Japanese army has recently forced the conscription of strong men in Northeast China. There are already 2 million Chinese compatriots who have been forcibly conscripted. In order to prevent their rebellion, they are mostly not allowed to fight in Chinese territory and are prepared to advance north or south, fighting against the Soviet Union or the United Kingdom and the United States. However, this kind of plan is just a waste of effort, because the Chinese compatriots in Northeast China are in high spirits, and the Japanese army cannot control them no matter where they are. 28th dispatch</p>

<h3>Review of US-Japan Talks Over the Past Two Weeks</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt met with the Japanese representative for 45 minutes on the 27th of this month. The following day, he convened a "War Cabinet" meeting at the White House. Afterwards, he went to his Warm Springs, Georgia, retreat for his usual weekend vacation. Before leaving, he told the press that US-Japan negotiations had not broken down, but how long they could continue would have to be asked of Japan. At the same time, the President believed that the key to peace or war in the Pacific rested entirely with Japan. Judging from Roosevelt's departure from Washington, it is clear that the US government is now awaiting Japan's response to Hull's note. Therefore, before Tokyo's formal reply, talks between the two sides have evidently come to a standstill. Looking back from the time Kurusu arrived in Washington to today, it has been exactly half a month. Although we have long asserted that it would be unsuccessful, it has been full of twists and turns. At one point, it even made people suspect that the US might be repeating its old appeasement tune. This doubt was not dispelled until Hull sent a note reiterating a firm stance. At this juncture, when US-Japan talks are hanging by a thread, tracing the diplomatic activities in Washington over the past two weeks may be helpful for observing the overall situation in the future.</p>
<p>In the two weeks after Japanese special envoy Kurusu arrived in the US, representatives from the US and Japan held a total of six meetings. However, in between, the US convened two ABCD group meetings and two "War Cabinet" meetings. This alone is sufficient to fully prove that the US is conducting talks with Japan not solely for its own interests, but representing the entire democratic front in the Far East. While the US government is engaged in diplomatic negotiations, it has by no means neglected the military preparations it should be undertaking. Kurusu arrived in Washington on the 15th of this month, which happened to be a Saturday. It was not until the 17th that he had his first meeting with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, lasting 70 minutes. Subsequently, Kurusu and Nomura held four more talks with Hull on the 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 27th. Among them, the one on the 18th lasted two hours and 45 minutes. It is said that Hull made every effort to persuade Japan to abandon aggression, withdraw from the Axis, and explained the benefits Japan could gain after changing course. The 20th was Thanksgiving, but the two sides continued to meet for one hour. According to news that emerged afterwards, the Japanese side essentially demanded three points: The ABCD alliance must be relaxed; The US must reduce aid to China; The US must stop pressuring Japan's efforts to build a "New Order in East Asia." These three points are equivalent to a restatement of Tojo's three principles. As for the price the Japanese side was willing to pay, it is said there were also three points: Not to cooperate directly with Germany; To stop military threats to the Dutch East Indies and Siberia; To be willing to end the war in China as soon as possible. This is significantly different in degree from the three major principles insisted upon by the US, namely, withdrawing from the Axis, abandoning aggression, and withdrawing troops stationed in China and Vietnam. In particular, the two items of troop withdrawal and withdrawal from the Axis are what the democratic front must fight for. Since the Japanese side's intentions had been fully revealed through the two meetings, Hull convened the first Far East Five-Power Conference on the 22nd. According to what was announced afterwards, the opinions of the participating countries were completely一致, and they were all willing to support the US's position in the talks with Japan. That evening, Hull had another long talk with the Japanese representatives for three hours. On Monday, the 24th, Hull convened the second Five-Power Conference. At this time, all sorts of bizarre rumors arose. Some said that the democratic countries had not reached a consensus, while others said that the US was prepared to sign a temporary agreement with Japan for a period of three months, in order to create a "breathing space" for confrontation in the Pacific. It was also at this time that, on the one hand, the situation on the Moscow front was urgent, and on the other hand, Hitler suddenly convened a meeting of countries that had signed the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact, attempting to counter the diplomatic struggle being waged by Washington. After three or four days of this commotion, the truth finally came to light on the 26th, when President Roosevelt met with Hu Shih and then Hull personally handed Kurusu and Nomura a note containing the basic principles of American diplomacy. The so-called US concessions to Japan turned into the US adhering to its consistent position, and the temporary agreement atmosphere, which had been quite rampant for a time, turned into a situation where US-Japan talks were on the verge of collapse. This situation has been somewhat confirmed by President Roosevelt's departure from Washington for a vacation.</p>
<p>In fact, if people only paid a little attention to the basic positions of the US and Japan, as well as the actual actions of both sides over the past two weeks, it would not be difficult to predict that the final fate of the Washington talks would be failure. It is universally known that Tojo's three principles are difficult to reconcile with Hull's fourteen points. At the same time, Japan's use of negotiation time to continuously increase troops in Vietnam and intensify threats to Thailand is sufficient to reveal that the Tokyo authorities have no sincerity in abandoning aggression. The US's continued strengthening of its military force in the Far East, assisting China in strengthening its border defenses, and even sending troops to Palau to station in the Dutch East Indies, also shows that the Washington authorities will not be fooled by Japan's smokescreen diplomacy. Therefore, looking ahead to the overall situation in the Far East, we believe that unless Tojo knows when to retreat, what will accompany the breakdown of US-Japan talks in the future will be a "showdown" between justice and violence.</p>
<h3>Fierce Tank Battle Between Soviet and German Forces on the Moscow Front; Red Army Launches Fierce Counter-Offensive Using Latest-Type Artillery in the Kalinin Sector</h3>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 29th – The "National Daily" Berlin dispatch states that Soviet troops on the Moscow front are still resisting desperately, just like the Soviet troops around Leningrad. Soviet artillery is constantly firing back at German forces, and the number of Soviet counter-attacks is increasing, the frequency is increasing, and the scope is also larger. According to captured artillery, the Soviet army is now using the latest-type artillery in the Moscow area.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 29th – German forces on the southern wing of the Moscow front are said to have made new progress, while Soviet forces are launching fierce counter-offensives in the Kalinin sector on the northern wing. According to "Pravda," Soviet forces have broken into German lines and occupied many villages, possibly to relieve the pressure on the Klin and Volokolamsk areas, where the fighting is extremely fierce. Moscow news acknowledges that German forces have made progress south of the Soviet capital, occupying City V in the Stalinogorsk district, but at the cost of at least 2,000 casualties, the loss of 50 artillery pieces, and a large number of weapons. In some locations, Soviet counter-attacks have driven back German forces. The German High Command announced yesterday that German forces had "broken through strong enemy positions" at some point on the Moscow front. German radio broadcasts stated that on the Moscow front, German tanks continue to advance, encountering Soviet tanks that are resisting and counter-attacking, resulting in a major tank battle. As for the southern front, Soviet General Timoshenko is continuing to lead his troops in a successful counter-offensive in the Rostov area. Red Star newspaper reported that Soviet forces yesterday recaptured a city defended by German forces after street fighting. German communiqués also acknowledged that Soviet forces were launching fierce counter-offensives near Rostov and the Donets River. There is very little news about the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula, but Berlin said that "the remnants of two Soviet divisions on the peninsula have been severely battered." "Pravda" also reported progress by Soviet forces on the Leningrad front. Finnish communiqués mentioned fierce attacks by Soviet forces on the Karelian front. Swedish news agency reported that elite Finnish troops attacked the Murmansk railway, destroying a section of track, but Soviet news stated that Finnish forces had been heavily damaged and retreated.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 29th – The German News Agency recently announced that German forces have occupied the Volokolamsk fortress city, a key point on the outer perimeter of Moscow.</p>
<p>Soviet Forces Making Good Progress on Southern Front; Three Elite German Divisions Annihilated</p>

In addition, our forces have destroyed 115 enemy tanks, 1,300 trucks, and 70 artillery pieces. Our forces are currently giving the enemy no chance to breathe and are still advancing.</p>
<p>Random Notes on the European War</p>
<h3>Germany After Two Years of War</h3>
<p>The following is a report from Stephen Laird, a reporter for the American "Life" magazine stationed in Berlin:</p>
<p>One day, Führer Hitler was giving a speech. I was sitting in a company car, listening to his speech through hundreds of loudspeakers along the way. I gently patted the driver on the shoulder and said, "What is he saying there?" The driver thought for a moment and replied, "He says we will definitely win." I asked him again, "So what do you think?" He remained silent, and I thought he wouldn't answer. After a while, he calmly replied, "Yes! I thought we had already won. Now I'm hoping for peace to come."</p>
<p>This is what the German people think. However, in Germany under Hitler's rule, the people's feelings are of little importance. They themselves admit this, so when referring to the German government, they often call it "they" instead of "we."</p>
<p>I lived in Germany for seven months, and the attitude of the German people has always been like this, and has not changed--always indifferent, enthusiastically patriotic, working hard, with no time to play. Although the food is rough, it is not lacking. Their government has also undergone some changes. The so-called "National Socialist Revolution" has long since ended. The future trend is showing the shadow of the past--military dictatorship. The power of the party is declining, the national economy is moving towards reaction, and even Hitler himself has changed.</p>
<p>After eight years of earth-shattering achievements, Hitler has proclaimed himself a superman who does not listen to the advice of those inferior to him in status. Anyone who does not please Hitler knows that they can no longer offer any unpleasant suggestions or reports to this dictator. At least four people, who used to be able to see Hitler at any time in case of emergency, told me that they now have to wait several weeks, if at all, to see the Führer. However, during the meeting, Hitler would express his own views endlessly, so that they had no chance to bring up the urgent issues they wanted to raise.</p>
<p>Now no one dares to ask questions in front of Hitler. Several people who often meet with him told me that not only do they have to nod and agree with everything Hitler says, but when they say yes repeatedly, they look up to him as if he were a god. Today, no one dares to say to Hitler: "The German people need peace. They are heartbroken by tightening their belts and extending working hours. They want to relax a little and taste what his promised fruits of victory are like." Today, no one dares to say to him: "Most young Germans hate the government's restraints, and even most Germans in the occupied territories do not feel liberated." When he was speaking to a group of cheering workers in a factory, he didn't know that most of them were party members wearing workers' clothes, and the real workers had been given half a day off. Hitler, however, believed that every German supported him like crazy.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Hitler decided to attack Soviet Russia, not even one general dared to tell him directly that it would take at least three weeks to annihilate the Red Army. German generals all knew that the military strength of Soviet Russia was much stronger than that of any country they had encountered before. Germany also had no pre-prepared "touring party" in Russia, and the Soviet government was not as easy to overthrow as Hitler had imagined. But their previous predictions had never been fulfilled. They had expressed doubts about the advance into the Rhineland, the breakthrough of the Maginot Line, and the collapse of France. Hitler was able to predict things like a god and plan everything without omission. He seemed to be a military genius. So if Hitler said that the Red Army could be defeated in three weeks, then it would be three weeks, and who would dare to say no?</p>
<p>Hitler is no longer just a leader of politics. He is an invincible military victor, and his life is often focused on military affairs. Because of his long-term study of military science, he has been able to deeply understand the secrets of warfare. He is the supreme commander and brilliant military strategist of Germany, and his position is unmatched. In addition to the Army General Staff, he also has his own military staff group, headed by General Alfred Jodl. General Jodl meets with him at least once a day, plans on his behalf based on his opinions, and then submits them to the Army General Staff.</p>
<p>Hitler is extremely pleased with this, because this is what he has always dreamed of. His favorite oil painting is of him in shining armor, sitting on horseback. He attaches great importance to this painting, and it is now hung everywhere throughout the country. Being a great military conqueror is actually much more fun than being a shop owner or a political leader of other failed middle class.</p>
<p>Except for going to the front to supervise the battle, Hitler's daily life is roughly the same in Berchtesgaden and Berlin. He usually goes to bed at two o'clock in the morning and does not get up until eleven o'clock. He actually sleeps only about four hours, and spends most of the rest of his time meditating or reading. According to people who know him, Hitler reads two books a day, mostly specialized books on military equipment or military history. He reads quickly and can remember everything he sees.</p>
<p>Every morning, he usually takes a bath in a green ceramic basin and shaves himself with a gold-plated razor. When he is in Berlin, there is also a barber and manicurist from the barber shop of the Kaiserhof Hotel to serve him. He wears a simple uniform all year round, which he created himself, adopting the style of the National Socialist uniform and changing to the color of the army uniform.</p>
<p>His diet is very simple and very regular. He eats breakfast alone in his bedroom, drinking Chinese tea and eating porridge, toast, butter and jam. Lunch consists of cold salad, eggs, fruit, and non-alcoholic beer. Dinner is roughly the same as lunch, sometimes with soup, rice, or pancakes. The chef who has worked for Hitler for more than a decade is short and fat, named Menanburg. He used to run a restaurant in Berlin and was proficient in cooking Austrian cuisine, especially good at making the pastries that Hitler loved to eat, but Hitler is now setting an example for the people and does not eat much anymore.</p>
<p>The non-alcoholic beer that Hitler drinks is specially made for him by a Munich brewery. Guests can drink whatever wine they like, but they are not allowed to smoke. Hitler considers smoking the most poisonous thing in the world, so he often says that he would rather see his enemies smoking than see his friends smoking. Hitler likes to tell anecdotes about celebrities and imitate other people's actions during meals, which is his unique talent.</p>
<p>When Hitler goes out, he travels in a twin-engine Condor plane, a black Mercedes-Benz limousine, a gray Mercedes-Benz six-wheeled military vehicle, and a special train, which he takes. The planes and vehicles are equipped with wireless radios, and the train has a section equipped with transmitters and receivers to receive news from all over the world.</p>
<p>Hitler's household is managed by three women—Linqi, Cross, and Youngkeff—and the servants are all young married women with children. Hitler is always running around or dictating orders in the reception room during the day, and rarely sees him sitting at his desk. He takes walks as exercise, and fills his pockets with nuts to feed the squirrels. He is an expert at waiting, often lying still for months, planning secretly. Once launched, he becomes tense and excited, as if he is much younger than usual. He is truly as still as a virgin, moving like a fleeing rabbit.</p>
<p>In addition to using war as a game, Hitler has sometimes looked at illustrated magazines from around the world (including Life, which is flown to him by German diplomats), reviewed weekly newsreels, compiled war reports from the General Headquarters, and listened to Wagner records, which he calls the ideal expression of the heyday of Germanism (an opera singer told me that Hitler has listened to this record two hundred times) (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Two US Yangtze Patrol Gunboats Quietly Left Shanghai Last Night; Believed to be Escorting Troop Withdrawal Ships to the Philippines; Rear Admiral Glassford Accompanied on the USS Luzon; Three British Ships All Repainted Gray in Preparation for Evacuation of Nationals</h3>
<p>Approximately ten hours after the last batch of US Marines boarded the President Harrison and left Shanghai, the USS Luzon (flagship) and USS Wake gunboats of the US Yangtze Patrol Force quietly left Shanghai from the estuary at 12:15 AM the same night. Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the fleet, also accompanied on the Luzon. The two gunboats are departing China following a recent announcement from Washington.</p>
<p>Escorting Troop Withdrawal Ships to Manila</p>
<p>The only remaining American gunboat in Shanghai is the USS Wake. It is widely believed that the Wake is staying in Shanghai to evacuate US officials if necessary. In other parts of China, only two American gunboats remain: the USS Mindanao, patrolling the Pearl River, and the USS Tutuila, stationed near Chongqing on the Yangtze River. Naval officials are remaining tight-lipped, but well-informed sources believe that the Luzon and Wake will escort the President Madison and President Harrison, which are carrying returning US military personnel and civilians, likely to Manila.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Izumo Fitted with Special Net</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that the Japanese flagship Izumo, docked in front of the NYK company wharf, was quite active the previous day and was fitted with a special net on its side, apparently to protect against magnetic mines. This indicates that the ship will sail out within a few days.</p>
<p>Concordia Medical and Army Medical Staff Evacuating</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports a Reuters dispatch from Beijing dated the 28th, stating that the American professors and doctors of the Peking Union Medical College will evacuate in early December following evacuation advice from the American Embassy in Beijing. It is also disclosed that the US Marines stationed in Beijing will also depart in early December. American military equipment and munitions were loaded onto trains yesterday and transported to Qinhuangdao, where the US military will board a transport ship to depart.</p>
<p>British Evacuation Ships Ready to Sail</p>
<p>A total of 1,075 British nationals (including women and children) have recently registered with the British Consulate General in Shanghai, preparing to evacuate. Of these, 500 are scheduled to depart Shanghai on the Anhui at 9:00 AM on the 28th, which is currently docked off the Bund outside of the French Concession at the Jardine Matheson wharf. Among the 500 British nationals, 72 came from Tianjin to Shanghai. Also docked near the Anhui are the Ewo vessel Mingsheng and the Taikoo vessel Chongqing. All three ships have been painted gray and the ship names have been removed, so it is generally expected that the other two ships will also transport British nationals from Shanghai for evacuation. The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that British nationals in Shanghai will evacuate to Hong Kong on the Anhui and change ships to Australia. This morning, the British Consul General announced that the luggage of the evacuating British nationals will be allowed to be loaded onto the ship on Tuesday (December 2nd). The previous statement that loading would take place on Monday has been changed. The Anhui is currently docked at the Jardine Matheson wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Passengers are prohibited from boarding until the final notification, and farewells are limited to the wharf area.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports Over One Hundred Men and Women Arrested</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that Ningbo authorities in Shanghai issued a message yesterday (27th) stating that all "terrorists" in the Shanghai area have been arrested in the concessions and the Chinese areas, totaling more than one hundred and twenty men and women. During the arrests, over seventy assorted handguns, approximately five thousand rounds of ammunition, eight hand grenades, seven bags of explosive materials, four boxes of chemicals, eighteen wireless radios, and six boxes of secret documents were seized.</p>
<h3>Smith and Watanabe Appointed Chief Deputy Commissioner; Gotō Appointed Assistant Deputy Commissioner in Charge of Criminal and Political Affairs</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council Information Office, the Council, upon the recommendation of the Japanese authorities, has appointed Watanabe Masami to succeed the late Akagi Chikashi. At the same time, the Council has established two Chief Deputy Commissioner positions in the Police Department, which will be filled by the current Acting Commissioner Smith and Watanabe Masami. In addition, the Council has appointed Major Gotō as Assistant Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department in charge of criminal and political affairs.</p>
<h3>Soviet Films Banned in the French Concession; All Political Activities and Propaganda, Regardless of Source, are Prohibited</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that it has been learned that Soviet films, since being imported into the Shanghai market, have been banned for the first time by the French Concession Police Department from being screened within the Concession. A spokesperson for the French Police Department, in response to reporters' questions, acknowledged that the Inspection Section of the Police Department had banned the screening of Soviet films, and issued the following formal statement:</p>
<p>In order to maintain order and prevent incidents that disrupt public security, the French Concession authorities have recently taken measures to prohibit all political activities and propaganda, regardless of their source. This is in accordance with the regulations of the French Concession, which stipulate that the French Concession must observe absolute neutrality. Therefore, the French authorities have reached an agreement with Soviet film distributors that Soviet films will no longer be screened within the French Concession. The above news was disclosed two weeks after the Soviet films were stopped from being screened.</p>
<p>The most recent film was screened at the Dôme Theatre. Since then, no Soviet films have been screened in any of the theaters in the French Concession. Soviet films are very popular in Shanghai, especially among Russians, and many of them are musical films. Others depict various current situations in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Price-Gouging Stores to Begin Today; Equipped with Red Seals to Temporarily Close Stores</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council will conduct inspections of stores selling goods at high prices this afternoon. The Council has prepared a large number of red seals to close down stores that are illegally profiting.</p>
<h3>Bureau Rice Sold for the First Time in the Extramural Areas; Hope that Stored Rice from the Suburbs Can Be Transported into the Concession for Sale</h3>
<p>The Bureau has reached an agreement with the downtown area to allow the supply of Bureau rice to the extramural road construction area. Therefore, forty rice stores in the area had Bureau rice available for sale for the first time yesterday morning. At the same time, the Municipal Council hopes to supply the International Settlement with large quantities of stored rice from outside the Concession, such as Pudong.</p>
<p>Over 30,000 Bags of Licensed Rice Sold</p>
<p>The registration of licensed rice stockpiles for rice shops lacking rice in the International Settlement has been completed. After verification, it has been determined that there are over 30,000 bags of stockpiled imported rice. The Rice Shop Association has already coordinated with the Rice Management Committee that all rice shops with obtained license cards, from number one to number ninety, should from yesterday go to No. 52 Maoyi Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, to the Association to obtain a payment and delivery slip. From tomorrow, they should present the slip to the designated rice shop to pay, stamp, and obtain a transportation permit for delivery, and then sell it at the market price, which is 130 national currency per stone (160 city catties net weight).</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Continues to Collect Toys for Needy Children at Christmas</h3>
<p>The toy drive organized by the Rotary Club, a well-known social organization in this city, in enthusiastic cooperation with the Asia Theater Company, has held two free charity events at the Majestic Theatre and one film screening at the Nanjing Theatre. Six thousand toys have already been collected, but this is still four-tenths short of the target of ten thousand. Recently, various charitable organizations in this city have also sent letters to the club, requesting the distribution of toys as Christmas gifts for needy children. Therefore, the club feels that the number of toys collected is increasingly insufficient for distribution. Giving toys to needy children is a form of educational spiritual relief. The club has been doing this for more than ten years. With the enthusiastic sympathy of the public, it has been able to proceed smoothly and achieve satisfactory results every year. In addition to those already collected this year, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate the remaining four thousand toys, so that needy children can also smile on the festive day of Christmas. Toys, whether new, old, complete or damaged, are all welcome. Donations should be sent to the Marty Motor Company at 640 Avenue Foch, or to Mr. Marber at telephone number 13016. Someone will be sent to collect them.</p>
<h3>Freight Rates Between Shanghai and Vietnam to Increase Next Month</h3>
<p>The French Shipping Company announced yesterday to shipping agents that freight rates between Shanghai and Vietnam will increase by 15% to 20% from the 15th of next month (December). The freight rate for general cargo from Shanghai to Haiphong will increase from HK$33 to HK$40 per ton, and the freight rate for general cargo from Shanghai to Saigon will increase from HK$36 to HK$43 per ton. There will be no increase in freight rates from Shanghai to Manila. According to inquiries with the company, the company's ship "Grand Dala N." is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila at 9:00 this morning, carrying 4,815 tons of low-quality rice from Saigon. The "Kai Ting Hao Shan" is scheduled to load a huge amount of coal in Haiphong, Vietnam, on the 3rd of next month and transport it to Shanghai. The company's "General Joffre" is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 3rd of next month, carrying a group of British and American expatriates evacuating from Shanghai and a large amount of food to Manila.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred People Froze to Death in One Day the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has turned cold, and the number of corpses found on the streets is increasing daily. In particular, the number of frozen corpses collected in the Public Concession the day before yesterday reached over a hundred. This is truly a serious problem in the depths of winter. The Pushan Villa has collected over 500 exposed corpses in recent days. The day before yesterday, due to the sudden cold weather, the villa's corpse-carrying vehicles were dispatched throughout the day. In total, 47 adult corpses and 72 children's corpses were collected, for a total of 119. The Federation of Charitable Organizations is scheduled to convene a preparatory meeting of various organizations at the beginning of next month to discuss the entire winter relief plan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Bonds Stop Transfer</h3>

<h3>Woodbridge's Radio Speech Delivers Earnest Advice to Japan, World Will Never Accept Hegemonic Policy, Prosperity Can Be Restored if Japan Awakens</h3>
<p>The well-known foreign commentator, Mr. Woodbridge, recently gave a radio speech on the China-America Broadcasting Station, entitled "If Japan Can Regain Sanity." The full text can be found in the Continental Daily News. The translated gist is as follows: "At present, some people in Japan hope that Japan and the Soviet Union can reach a compromise on the Far East issue. The Japan Times, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has proposed seven conditions to persuade the United States to agree to maintain peace in East Asia. The Japanese Prime Minister has also announced three goals, all of which Japan hopes to achieve in the Washington negotiations. However, the US government is unwilling to accept either of the above two requests.</p>
<p>Mistakes Made Due to Following the Beaten Path</p>
<p>The Tanaka Memorial of 1927 advocated conquering the world. Although some Japanese have denounced it as bizarre and absurd, various facts prove that Japan's policy is undoubtedly opportunistic. It once used the occupation of Northeast China to test the reaction of various countries, but the result was that it did not encounter the slightest obstruction. The Lugouqiao Incident in 1937 was not originally intended to be far-reaching. At first, it was only intended to be used as an excuse for military action in North China. Unexpectedly, the scope of the incident expanded day by day, and the attitude of the world's countries showed that it would not encounter any powerful blows on its way forward. That winter, it still intended to accept peace negotiations, thinking that it should stop at the right time. Unexpectedly, various countries made one mistake after another.</p>
<p>Germany and Japan Have Different Aims</p>
<p>We have only seen the transition from the "New Order" in China to the "New Order in East Asia," and then to the so-called "Greater East Asia New Order" and the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The latter includes China, Australia, and Malaya. If we interpret Matsuoka's words seriously, California is also within its scope. However, these are all the intentions of the Japanese military. The Japanese government did not originally have such intentions until the outbreak of the European War, which gave it an unprecedented opportunity to achieve its goals. Japan joined the Axis powers out of practical necessity. The Germans sincerely wished to see Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States meet on the battlefield. In this way, it would not only be able to contain the United Kingdom and the United States, but also weaken Japan's own strength, so that Germany could go anywhere.</p>
<p>It's Still Time to Pull Back from the Brink</p>
<p>My (Woodbridge's self-designation) delusions arose from recent telegrams from Washington. The telegrams briefly listed the conditions put forward by the United States. If these conditions are accepted by Japan, I dream that Japan will eventually have a day of clarity. The conditions put forward by the United States now are to urge Japan to withdraw from the Axis powers, or at least guarantee that it will not join the Axis powers in combat, give up its attempts to advance south and north, withdraw its troops from China and Vietnam, and guarantee equal commercial opportunities for all countries in the Pacific. Now we assume that the Japanese have accepted these conditions.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Disaster Is Unimaginable</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Minister of Finance, when he was asked to increase the supplementary expenditure of 3.8 billion yuan, he said to the parliament that the total amount of government expenditure since the incident was about 48 billion yuan, which was about the sum of the total expenditure for the 70 years before 1936. He also admitted that the British and American freezing orders have had a serious impact on Japan. Therefore, if the freezing orders are still strictly enforced, the "China Incident" is still not resolved, and Japan goes to war with the United Kingdom and the United States, then in addition to the losses of the army and navy, the economic difficulties will make the lives of the Japanese people in the future unimaginable.</p>
<p>Restoring Prosperity Is Not Difficult</p>
<p>However, if it can accept the conditions of the United States, then its future will be completely new. The economic losses suffered in the China Incident and the Northeast Incident will take years to make up for. However, its economic prospects will definitely change dramatically in a few months and tend towards prosperity. If the Japanese army can withdraw from China, then there will be no obstacles between China and Japan, and they can work together. Japan's past attempts at monopoly must be abandoned. Because of its geographical proximity to China, it will definitely be able to obtain considerable economic benefits from China. At the same time, dismissing its nearly one million troops will add infinite manpower to its industrial development. Japan is currently busy with war and dealing with incidents, so it has no spare capacity to engage in trade and shipping. The United States' proposed condition of equal commercial opportunities for Pacific countries will naturally be interpreted as giving Japan equal rights to freely use the raw materials of Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Macau, the United States, and China. The United Kingdom and the United States will still have to devote themselves to fire production. In this way, Japan will have excellent opportunities in the commodity market after production. The merchant ships currently requisitioned by Japan for military use can then be used on the Pacific supply line.</p>
<p>Survival or Destruction, the Choice Is Theirs</p>
<p>The concept of national glory is by no means essential to Japan at present. Japan's way out at present is either survival or destruction, either prosperity or destruction. It can endure the current sacrifices and stand forever in the position of a civilized country. These slight sacrifices will be enough to compensate in a few years. If it does not change its original intention, it will inevitably fall into destruction. If Japan can change its current state, it should immediately return to its loyal allies, cooperate with them, and forever be a strong country in the world. Japan has always misinterpreted the word cooperation, because the original meaning of cooperation is to work together to achieve the same goal, rather than use force to subdue others in order to achieve one's own selfish desires. Unless Japan can cleanse itself of the hatred caused by the past four years, East Asia will never have a day of peace.</p>

<p>The Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship Fund received over 6,000 yuan from the Paramount Sports Club yesterday from the proceeds of charitable basketball game tickets, the highest donation record since the fundraising this year, enough to subsidize more than 100 poor students. This great act of righteousness has given powerful support to the colleagues of this newspaper's scholarship fund and is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Mr. Ku Lien-cheng Was Kind and Benevolent</p>
<p>The Paramount Sports Club was founded before the war by the philanthropist Mr. Ku Lien-cheng, with a well-established organization. It has held charitable competitions over the years, with the proceeds being allocated to charitable causes, achieving outstanding results. Mr. Ku was kind and benevolent, and spared no effort in promoting sports. He was happy to provide support to social welfare and charitable organizations whenever they requested it. He was truly a practitioner of "the greatest joy is in doing good."</p>
<p>Ticket Income Is Equally Distributed</p>
<p>The club's letter stated, "The ticket income from our club's charitable basketball game will be equally distributed to the Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship Fund, the News Daily Loan Scholarship Fund, and the Jidong Children's Education Home's scholarship savings. The result of the competition is that the total income is 19,131 yuan in national currency (all competition expenses of approximately 3,000 yuan are borne by President Ku himself), which has been verified by accountant Xu Yongzuo to be accurate. It is estimated that the Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship Fund should receive 6,377 yuan in national currency. A check is attached for your acceptance and a receipt would be appreciated."</p>
<p>Total Scholarship Fund Is Nearly 50,000</p>
<p>Yesterday's donations included 6,377 yuan from the Paramount Sports Club, 500 yuan from Liu He Ji, and 10 yuan from Mr. Luo Hongtao, totaling 6,887 yuan. The previous balance was 40,430.82 yuan, for a total of 47,317.82 yuan.</p>
<h3>Huge Fire on Chu Pao San Road Yesterday Morning, Destroyed More Than Twenty Houses, Jin Tai Paper Shop Caught Fire and Suffered Heavy Losses, Many People Burned, One Woman and One Child Died, Fire Also Broke Out on Jing An Temple Road Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>An unprecedented fire broke out in the French Concession yesterday morning. The fire was so fierce that it had never been seen before. As a result, more than twenty houses were destroyed and more than ten people were killed or injured. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<p>All Fire Engines Dispatched</p>
<p>The Jin Tai Paper Shop at 4 and 6 Chu Pao San Road suddenly caught fire at about 1:00 yesterday morning. At that time, because the shop was piled with a huge amount of paper, the fire spread extremely fiercely. The flames soared and quickly burned to neighboring houses. Residents were awakened from their dreams, fleeing for their lives, and the order was chaotic, with crying and shouting filling the air. The Central Fire Brigade was notified and drove to the scene. Because the fire was not easy to extinguish, it requested that more vehicles be dispatched. Therefore, the French Concession Fire Brigade immediately dispatched all of its approximately 20 pump trucks and ambulances. The Public Concession also dispatched six pump trucks to assist in fighting the fire at the scene. The fire was completely extinguished until noon yesterday.</p>
<p>The Area Burned Covered Dozens of Families</p>
<p>After the incident, it was inspected that the fire extended north to the Hua Du Ballroom at 51 Avenue Edward VII, and south to 49 Rue du Consulat, including 4 and 6 Chu Pao San Road, the Jin Tai Paper Shop, 8 and 10, the Li Chang First Warehouse, 12, the Heng He Tai Paper and Foil Shop, 14 and 16, the Ping An Hotel, 18 and 20, a silver dollar bar, 22 and 24, the Tong Yi Shop, 26 and 28, a certain wine bar, 44 Rue du Consulat, the An Le Barber Shop, 46, 48, 50, and 52, and on Avenue Edward VII, it extended to 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, and 47, etc., more than twenty houses. Among them, the Ping An Hotel had more than 140 rooms on the upper floors of the above numbers, all of which were burned down, resulting in the greatest loss.</p>
<p>Thirteen People Injured, Two Killed</p>
<p>When the fire was raging, residents fled one after another, and many people were injured. A total of eight men and women fell and were injured by jumping from buildings, and four people were burned. All were sent to the hospital for treatment. The injured included Mao Jiangshi, Liu Zhangshi, Wu Yingchang, Wu Jiangshi (wife of lawyer Lu Ping), Zhang Yebi, Jin Jiabin, and many others. It was also learned that one woman and one child had died in the fire, and one firefighter was injured. After the incident, the police learned that the fire started at the Jin Tai Paper Shop and went to summon the owner, Tang Shaotai. Unexpectedly, Tang had fled in fear of punishment. Statistics show that the losses in this battle were extremely large, but most of them had fire insurance.</p>
<p>Fire Also Broke Out on Jing An Temple Road</p>
<p>At 2:30 yesterday afternoon, a fire suddenly broke out on the ground floor of No. 3, 646 Lane (Ming Yu Fang), Jing An Temple Road, Public Concession, and immediately spread, breaking through the roof. After the fire brigade learned of this, it immediately drove to the scene to fight the fire, which was finally extinguished after a long time. At that time, many residents lived on the upper floors of the building. Because the ladder was burned, they fell and were injured by jumping from the building, and several people were burned. Sun Hufa, 29 years old, was injured in the face, hands, and left foot. Sun Saijin, 57 years old, was injured in the face and hands. Dai Gentang, 21 years old, was injured in the head. Chen Sijin, 26 years old, was burned all over the body. The above were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. In addition, Sun Linzhuang, 38 years old, was burned all over the body. Dong Abao, 12 years old, and Wu Jiakui, 40 years old, were injured in the head and face. They were sent to the Red Cross Hospital. It was also learned that the bodies of one man, one woman, one boy, and one girl were found in the fire after the incident.</p>

<h3>Dance Girl Almost Electrocuted by Her Husband After Breaking Off Engagement, Yan Yinhe Sentenced to Five Years for Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>Zhong Yumei, a 19-year-old Henan woman living at 1 Huanghe Road, worked as a dance girl at the Jue Lu Ballroom. In March of this year, she met a dance patron, Yan Yinhe, a 29-year-old man from Suzhou. At that time, Yan claimed that he had not yet married and intended to spend the rest of his life with Zhong. Zhong was seduced by his sweet words and registered their engagement with Yan in the newspaper in May, and immediately began cohabitation. Unexpectedly, after cohabitation, she discovered that Yan was actually an</p>
<p>Unemployed Idler</p>
<p>His food, clothing, housing, and transportation all depended on Zhong's income from dancing. When that was not enough, he used all kinds of methods to swindle her savings of more than 4,000 yuan. Unable to bear the hardship, she managed to break off the engagement with Yan in September, but Yan still pestered her from time to time. At about 3:00 the day before yesterday afternoon, Yan went to the Asia Hotel at 571 Hankou Road, opened room 242, and telephoned Zhong, using the excuse of buying a winter coat on her behalf,</p>
<p>Luring Her to Come</p>
<p>At this time, Yan had started to want to kill Zhong, as he could no longer obtain money from her. He imitated the method used by the Zhou brothers to kill their father, and purchased a very long roll of electric wire and three plugs from an old goods stall on Ningbo Road in the French Concession. One plug was installed at each end of the electric wire. Another plug was installed on the electric light in the room using a light bulb socket. Then, one end of the plug was inserted, so that the electric wire</p>
<p>Passed Through Current</p>
<p>Reaching the plug at the other end. After arranging everything properly, when the woman came, Yan became intimate with her. After the event, taking advantage of her exhaustion, he suddenly placed the plug carrying an electric current on her right waist, intending to electrocute her to death. The woman felt pain from the electricity and struggled with all her might, and shouted for help. The tea room attendant opened the door and entered, and the woman was rescued. The incident was reported to the Old Gate Police Station, and Hua Detective Liu Junjie rushed there and</p>
<p>Arrested Yan</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted him for attempted murder, and stated that the hospital examination showed that Zhong's right waist was burned, but the injury was minor. When questioned, Yan admitted that he intended to kill the woman, but claimed that he had repeatedly attempted suicide and that he had agreed with the woman to die together this time. However, Zhong denied this. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao sentenced Yan Yinhe to five years of imprisonment for attempted murder, and the electric wire, plugs, etc. were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director of the Police Department Captures a Bandit, Confiscates a Pistol</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said that the Deputy Director of the Public Concession Police Department, T. Robertson, personally captured an armed bandit at the Racecourse at 8:45 yesterday morning (28th). A few minutes before being arrested, the bandit, together with three other bandits (none of whom were armed), had robbed a Chinese man of his overcoat, 340 yuan in cash, and a bank check at the intersection of Dagu Road and Ma Huo Road, and then dispersed. The other three bandits fled to the French Concession. The armed bandit stayed behind, threatening the victim not to call the police, and then also headed towards the French Concession. However, the victim was unwilling to give up and followed from a distance. After entering the French Concession, he reported to two Chinese constables to pursue. The bandit fled quickly. After returning to the Public Concession via several roads, Robertson was driving his car east along Racecourse Road, heading to the Police Headquarters for work. He heard the police siren blaring and saw the bandit fleeing towards Racecourse Road, with two Chinese constables chasing behind. Robertson then drove his car to block him, jumped out of the car, and captured the bandit. He confiscated a pistol and four bullets from him. Two of the other bandits who committed the robbery were also arrested by detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station not long after. They were escorted to the First Special Court for questioning this morning (29th).</p>
<h3>French Police Arrest a Gang of Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhu Gunong, the Chinese Inspector of the French General Police Department, and West Detective Greiner received a secret report at 8:30 on the morning of the day before yesterday, saying that a large number of bandits were hiding in Room 11 of the foreign house at 15, 697 Lane, Avenue Joffre, plotting illegal activities. Inspector Zhu led all the detectives, including Ruan Guofan, Xu Shibiao, Chang Xinming, and Chen Rongtang, wearing steel vests, and drove to the scene to surround and arrest them without making a sound. They arrested four bandits on the spot, including local resident Shao Qi (26 years old), Lu Guomin (24 years old), Ye Renzhi (27 years old), and a woman named Chen Feifei (20 years old, from Ningbo, who specialized in transporting firearms). They confiscated a Mauser pistol, three pistols, more than a hundred bullets, and other stolen goods from under the bed, and brought them all into the police station. Under interrogation by the police chief, Shao and the other bandits admitted that they had committed dozens of thefts in the British and French Concessions.</p>

<p>The joint exhibition of Chinese and Western paintings by the couple Li Yongsen and Shao Jinyun, held at the Daxin Painting Gallery this week, has attracted prominent figures from the art world, both Chinese and foreign, to visit successively in the three days since its opening. Mr. Li's realistic watercolors are light, lively, soft, and harmonious, bright, and lustrous. Ms. Shao's meticulous flower and bird paintings, with their precise outlines and fillings, are ancient, elegant, beautiful, firm, pure, and free. The works imitating the masters of the late Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties are full of spirit. Her paintings such as "Spring on Eyebrows," "Jade Hall Wealth and Honor," and "Foraging" vividly capture the states of birds resting and playing among the chaotic rocks, clusters of flowers, sparse, and scattered reeds, making them lifelike and no less beautiful than the Zhao Chang's sketches. They are truly excellent works.</p>

<h3>Gold Supply Abundant; Fluctuation Range Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market started dark, and the fluctuation turned small. The trend continued to weaken, and the price once fell below 13,000 yuan. Because the US-Japan negotiations have been difficult to obtain accurate news, all parties are tired, and the market transaction is supply to wholesale, and demand is zero.

The closing price was still 400 yuan lower. Half-day transactions totaled 7,360 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the outside market price was 13,300 yuan.</p>

Xianghe, Xiangxing Yong, Mingfeng, and Tianyuan came to sell aggressively, and the price plunged by 550 yuan, entering below 13,000 yuan, falling to a low price of 12,950 yuan. Chengji suddenly came to advance aggressively, and Xianghe repurchased Hesheng, Yongcheng, bill merchants, and Zhongxing to compete for strength, and the price rose back by 300 yuan, rising to 13,250 yuan. Xiangxing Yong, Tongkang Yong, and Tianyuan sold again, and the price fell back to 13,050 yuan.

At 1:30 PM, it rose back by 30 yuan, totaling 1,380 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan). Patterned silver still hangs at 22 yuan, and the black market at 16 yuan is said to be flat.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rate Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, the Central Bank and HSBC's quotes did not fluctuate. The prices of small counters such as HSBC were also flat. The black market exchange rate of British and American foreign exchange, the black market British exchange rate, one pound was quoted at 3.75, with supply but no demand, and remained stable throughout. The US exchange rate showed a slight softening, and it was not certain that 3.75 could be settled. A certain non-essential goods foreign firm once raised the price to settle, but did not get it, and there was no transaction. The closing price at noon was the same as the previous price, which was flat with the previous day and the US slightly softened. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds each fell by 10 yuan, British gold bills rose by 1 yuan, and American gold bills once fell to 26.5 yuan, and finally were 27.4 yuan, which was an increase of 20 cents compared with the previous day. Hong Kong bills were slightly tired, and Japanese gold bills and Korean bills did not change. The former still stood at the original price of 2.7 yuan, and the latter was still 2.6 yuan. The demand for military tickets was surprisingly strong, and the evening market was as high as 3.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Investors Add to Positions on Dips; Prevent Excessive Fall in Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market started weak and then rose, but the trend was slightly calm. This is because the bulls are preparing to take delivery, and the shorts also intend to cover. Therefore, the table surface is loose and tight. The large investors have no intention of abandoning the goods they bought, and they continue to add to their positions on dips, so the market is stabilizing. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 2,440 yuan, and the low price was 2,365 yuan. Due to the week-end relationship in the afternoon, as usual</p>
<p>Double Horse opened flat in the morning. The opening price was 2,410 yuan. As soon as this price opened, there were many sellers in the market, and the market fell straight to 2,365 yuan. At this time, gold also fell. Unexpectedly, the opening price of yarn and cloth on the exchange did not fall sharply, and people's hearts took a good step. At the same time, large investors took delivery, so the shorts also actively covered, and the market slowly rose back to 2,440 yuan at the close. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 2,850 bales.</p>
<p>The market situation of the Golden Double Horse Futures Yarn Market, after the delivery in November, started trading again yesterday, and the market atmosphere turned from weak to strong, with fluctuations ranging from 70 to 80 yuan to more than 100 yuan. When the morning first opened, it was first because of rumors that the negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to be turning unfavorable, and people were generally concerned and inevitably had unnecessary worries. Therefore, the factory orders first fell, and once fell to a low price of 2,365.00. Relying on the weakness of the futures yarn, gold companies and securities firms successively spit out, and the December contract opened at a low price of 2,350 yuan, the January contract opened at 2,470 yuan, and also once fell to 2,450 yuan, and the February contract was close to the low price of 2,520 yuan. After entering, with the gold market turning strong, the current yarn is also hovering upstream, people's hearts are stable, and the buying side absorbs suddenly and sees strong again, and the prices of each month's futures rise successively, the recent term rose to 2,450.00, the January contract also rose to 2,530.00, and the February contract rose to 2,580.00. Its fluctuating trend is completely tied to the gold market and factory orders. In fact, the current trend of the yarn market is following the general attention of people to the international situation, and its root is the tightening of silver funds and the relationship of mortgages. It is said that the cost of yarn is 300 to 400 yuan higher than the current market price. Therefore, due to this level, those who short can't help but have concerns, while the potential of the multi-party is inevitably reduced due to the obstruction of the situation and silver funds. Observing its trend, if the silver funds and the environment can be slightly relaxed, the change will inevitably be rapid. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the list is shown below</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is still stagnant. The factory side has no appetite for processing due to the sluggish yarn market. The industry is watching with hands tied as the end of the year approaches. Everyone is waiting for the opportunity to decide the outcome.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to purchases by peers and brokers, and then fell back due to short covering and profit-taking by the Southern gangs. Yesterday's closing price fell by about three or four pounds from the previous day.</p>
<p>There were few transactions in the Indian cotton market. At the same time, the market was slightly tired due to the continuous short covering by cotton merchants and sales by speculators. Yesterday's closing prices fell by two or three rupees each. It is also predicted that the market situation will continue to be slightly lower by half a rupee when the market opens today.</p>
<h3>The Essentials of Price Control</h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>Looking at the implementation of prices by the Shanghai Municipal Council since November, it can be roughly divided into two parts: (A) Control methods, which are further divided into three items: Control of four daily necessities: rice, flour, coal, and oil; Approval of the limited prices of imported goods, medicines, etc. assessed by the Importers Association; Crackdown on hoarding of dangerous liquids and substances. The current status of the implementation of the first two items, with regard to necessities, the control of rice is the strictest, such as the establishment of rice sales offices, restrictions on the quantity of goods, investigation of hoarding, and prohibition of private transportation; flour is being investigated and funds are being raised to purchase flour for flat sales from the prohibition of transportation; as for edible oil, only merchants are being invited to contract for purchase and the selling price is being controlled; coal is only being investigated for the use of coal in industry. (B) Control techniques, which include Regulations on the setting of labels on retail items; Verification of records of goods purchased, sold, and inventoried.</p>
<p>We analyze the price control policies adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, which include the following four types: One is to purchase and sell at half price, such as the measures for necessities such as rice, flour, powder, oil, and coal; the second is to limit prices, such as the announcement of limited prices for imported goods, food, medicines, etc.; the third is to limit the quantity purchased, such as the restriction of one dou of food rice per person; the fourth is to crack down on national hoarding, such as the registration of rice and flour, and the regulations on licensing for the storage of dangerous liquids and substances. Although; transportation is difficult, funds are short and thin, and it is difficult to see results by selling cheaply, this is the difficulty of selling at flat prices. When supply and demand are balanced, prices will be flat. If you force a fixed limit, evils will arise. This is the difficulty of limiting prices. Investigation and statistics, dance planning and arrangement, if there is anything that is not successful, it will be difficult to succeed. This is the difficulty of limiting purchases. The value of the currency is falling, prices are rising, and protecting wealth and seeking profit is the constant sentiment of people. This is the difficulty of cracking down on hoarding. If the system is not complete, the organization is not strict, the planning is not thorough, and the implementation is not effective, as a result, the effect is not seen but the evils have already arisen, and the price has not been halved and the law has been relaxed. For example, today's limited-price products, the stores selling them, for example, have no goods and refuse to sell them. Also, for example, the limited quantity of rice, the profiteering奸民, with their waists wrapped in rope, privately transport it out of the border. The limited-price products are not in short supply, and the limited quantity of rice is only one dou, and its evils are like this, and others are irrelevant.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office once said: In order to seek a balance in the import of goods and a reasonable supply of prices, it is intended to seek cooperation with the Price Equalization Fund Committee, various shipping companies, and commercial officials from various countries: This is the premise of flat-price purchase and sale. It also said: Officially set prices must not be exceeded, and those who violate them will be punished; at the same time, members of the Importers Association will also refuse to continue supplying goods to those who violate them; This is the pillar of limited prices. It is also said: When necessary, retail sales will be carried out on their own. In the future, those who purchase goods will be given identification cards and a per capita allocation method will be adopted; This is the foundation for limiting purchases. It is further claimed that the supply of goods is limited to urgent needs, and if possible, containers should be opened and labels should be removed; and importers will recover old containers and old labels before distributing new goods; This is the key to cracking down on hoarding. Therefore, today's Shanghai Municipal Council controls the payment of compensation, striving to eliminate evils and achieve effects, to have strict laws and flat prices, to not disturb the people but to have the reality of benefiting the people, to punish hoarding but not to infringe on the inventory that should be there, which is solid enough to be the political body to be used.</p>
<h3>Domestic Debt Stable</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds was extremely stable yesterday. Moreover, due to the Saturday closing relationship, there were very few transactions, and the trend was still uncertain. The rise and fall of various public bonds differed quite a bit. Both the bulls and the bears were expecting something and had their own goals. It is feared that there will not be any huge ups and downs for the time being. Yesterday was Saturday and the market opened at 11:00 AM, with only one trade. The pressure from the shorts still felt relatively heavy. Type C once rose to 8.7 yuan after opening, but failed to stabilize. Type B had more scattered retail demand, so it was uniquely superior. The buyers only absorbed a slight drop in Rund and Yiji. The sellers were accompanied by Dingkang and Tongkang. As a result, except for Type D, which did not open, and Type A, which had no high or low prices, the other three types also varied. The total transaction volume was estimated to be about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transaction: 100 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 60 yuan per share.</p>
<h3>Western Flour Uniquely Tired; Japonica Rice Continues to Report Declines</h3>
<p>Since the suspension of northern sales of foreign flour, the market situation has become increasingly lifeless. Although there is demand in this street, those who hold the goods are timid and fearful, and mostly take the initiative to devalue the price and sell early. In particular, the imported flour registered in West Wharf is tired. Yesterday, the price of West Wharf Golden Dragon was discussed as 35 yuan, which is close to the flat-price public sale price. However, the stock of wheat in the small wheat wharf has been dry for a long time, and new arrivals have not followed. Occasionally, there are arrivals that still try to defend, so Duke wheat is still standing between 72 and 3 yuan. Bran has been cleared by inland villages, and small bags of bran have seen a slight station again, with a price opening at 56 yuan.</p>
<p>The northern transportation of foreign wheat flour has not stopped. Those who have been transporting to Tianjin for days have been recorded in this newspaper many times. It is now known that the Yih和 洋行 Rising Sun Wheel will go to Tianjin today. In addition to transporting bulk foreign rice and sugar, there are also a large number of 43,300 bags of foreign wheat flour transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive at the port. The Yih和 洋行 Rising Sun Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and unloaded 5,072 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, mooring at the Roosevelt Wharf. Another 8,341 bags of foreign rice are scheduled to be transported to Tianjin by the original ship today, and 2,000 bags will be added in this city to be transported to Tianjin, (祖)</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was still scarce in the market, and domestic rice was gradually becoming more prosperous. Yesterday, vendors brought three or four hundred bags of northern and southern japonica rice and top-grade rice, but the actual sales were not even half of the appetite, so the price of each rice was reduced by two or three yuan. Kunshan's new japonica rice ranged from 180 yuan to 175 yuan, Qingsi thin rice from 171 yuan to 170 yuan, Du pointed rice 164 yuan, and Yinyuan 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Rose More, Fell Less</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market situation, edible oil first saw a setback due to the urgent sale of floating hoarding, and finally returned to rise after being absorbed and purchased by people in the industry. As a result, the former and latter are similar to each other, with a slight difference of two or three yuan. Soybeans saw a turn-up of two or three yuan due to the lively sales of local customers, and corn also tended to rise by one or two yuan due to weak hoarding purchases. The unified market sold more than 100 barrels of Dayun soybean oil, 10 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, and another 200 cans, 500 dan of Rihua factory vegetable oil, 1,000 bags of Tianjin New Jinyuan, another 400 bags of green beans, 2,000 bags of corn spot, and more than 300 tons of futures.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Without Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, with the joint venture company settling accounts and futures trading suspended. Only over three thousand bags of spot goods were traded. The trend was stable, without major fluctuations. The guild's pricing: this month's No. 24 coarse white was initially priced at 202 yuan in the morning, reaching 204 yuan, then 203.5 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately closing at 204 yuan. October was initially priced at 200 yuan to 201 yuan in the morning, with one afternoon session at 202 yuan. September was at 196 yuan. Hong Kong coarse was at 171 yuan to 175 yuan. Taikoo (DY refined white) mark was at 177 yuan, HX mark at 176 yuan. Dutch red spot goods were at 168 yuan to 169.5 yuan, opening higher by one yuan to 170.5 yuan in the afternoon, with road goods trading at 173.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Java Company's Zhisali ship arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 6,000 tons of sugar, totaling 60,000 bags, loaded from Java. It docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Also, Jardine Matheson's Rising Sun ship loaded 2,180 bags of sugar from this city and transported them to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Anthracite Coal Plummets: Coal Merchants Reap What They Sow</h3>
<p>In the coal market, since the new arrival of white coal, managers and dealers have resumed sales as usual. The informal market has disappeared, and old stockpiles are rushing to be released, causing anthracite coal to be greatly stimulated, with prices reversing and plummeting. Indian anthracite coal entered the market at 800 yuan, but the future market only opened at 720 yuan. Kailan coal also followed suit, plummeting to 650 yuan for lumps, a sharp drop of over 100 yuan. Things reach an extreme and then revert, prosperity is followed by decline, the principles of heaven circulate, and it can be said to be unerring. Those who climb high fall hard, and coal merchants reap what they sow.</p>
<h3>Rosary Peas Not Very Useful</h3>
<p>Rosary peas, also known as red beans, are scarce in both arrivals and inventory. However, this item, aside from its occasional use in medicinal materials, is primarily used in pastry shops as "eyes" in powdered goods, with minimal demand. Therefore, market prices have not been able to rise significantly. Yesterday, the market price was 200 yuan, only a limited increase from before.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Trading Exceptionally Brisk</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fluctuated, with exceptionally brisk trading, as both buyers and sellers showed little interest. Selling prices first declined and then rebounded. Flower and butterfly coarse cloth was initially sold at 89.25 yuan in the morning, closing at 90.05 yuan to 90.1 yuan. Fuguang fine cloth factory orders were bid up to 80 yuan in the future market, but no transactions occurred. Spot goods were generally 2 yuan cheaper per bolt. Other grades of coarse and fine cloth showed little fluctuation compared to the previous day, with some increasing or decreasing by 5 jiao. Over 100 pieces were traded on this street.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Futures prices fell sharply due to the steep decline of Blue Phoenix gauze. Lu soft cloth and regular colored ball mark cloth for December opened down 2.5 yuan, closing at 82.1 yuan, a drop of 2.9 yuan per bolt compared to before settlement. January closed at 84.8 yuan, also down 2.69 yuan. Spot market selling prices showed minimal changes. The leading fine cloth factory orders closed at 88 yuan at noon, up 5 jiao, while lower-grade miscellaneous fine cloth continued to decline by 5 jiao to 1 yuan due to sluggish actual sales, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>Western-Lettered Woolen Fabrics Not So Special</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric trend was stable. Western-style fabrics had stronger market conditions than general fabrics. Actual sales seemed weaker than at the beginning of the week. Prices for riding breeches, pilica, and light floral woolen fabrics were generally weak internally but strong externally. Woolen fabrics with Western letters have recently become less popular than before. This is because this year, domestically produced goods, whether Western-style or floral, iroko, doskin, panama, or single-sided floral, all have Western letters woven into them. They are everywhere in the market and are no longer special. Conversely, genuine English woolen fabrics often no longer have Western letters woven into them. Therefore, woolen fabrics with letters today are no longer a valuable selling point.</p>

<h3>The Way of Reading</h3>
<p>— Qingzheng</p>
<p>When it comes to the words "reading," we should first understand why we read. Most people only know how to "memorize mechanically" and cannot understand its truth. Now I will summarize it in one sentence: Reading is for learning the principles of being a person. Some people think that reading is for becoming a high official and making a fortune, but that is not correct. I remember Zeng Guofan's letter to his son Ji Hong saying: "... I don't want you to become a high official, but I hope you will be a gentleman who understands principles through reading... You must not be greedy for luxury..." (From this, we can know that reading is not for personal wealth and enjoyment, but to make some contributions to society and the country.)</p>
<p>As for what attitude should be adopted when reading? I think the first thing to do is to concentrate your mind and body. For example, when writing an essay, my mind is only thinking about how to write the essay, and I don't care about anything else; as the saying goes, "You can't do two things at once," otherwise you are not focused, and the same is true for reading and doing things. If you don't concentrate on reading, then this lesson is equivalent to "reading in vain;" because his heart has not received it, how can he understand the book? Secondly, you must not think you are too smart. Zhu Xi said: "Because he first has the idea of ​​becoming a sage, it is difficult to enter." Reading should also have durability. If you read a lesson for a long time and still cannot understand its true meaning, if you don't have durability, you simply don't like to read it; or you read for a while and then go to play, and after playing for a while, you come back to read; all of this is useless.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the true meaning of reading, you should have the above-mentioned attitudes, carefully read it several times, extract the essence, and remember it firmly; don't read too much and then find it difficult to understand the reason. Therefore, reading is not about quantity, but about being able to understand the essence of the book.</p>
<p>Some people also get discouraged because they don't read well. I think if you read according to the above principles, you will eventually succeed! Because "failure is the mother of success!"</p>
<h3>The Water-Drinking American</h3>
<p>— Liyi</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, the American president who liberated the slaves, was very poor when he was young. Once, he went to work in a printing shop in England. Almost everyone in the shop, which had more than fifty workers, liked to drink beer, before breakfast, during breakfast, after breakfast, during lunch, during dinner, and after dinner, they had to drink several times a day; but Lincoln didn't drink any, he only drank some plain water, and his work efficiency was greater than others. He could carry lead type with both hands up and down the stairs, but others couldn't do it. Therefore, everyone called him "the water-drinking American." The other workers often owed a lot of money because of excessive drinking, and their salaries were spent as soon as they got them. Later, even the hotel refused to lend them money for wine, so they had to ask Lincoln to guarantee their credit. Lincoln not only did not waste his salary, but also had excellent credit. Only then did the workers have the opportunity to taste wine again; and Lincoln then deducted the workers' wine money on the spot when he paid his salary every Saturday and returned it to the hotel without any ambiguity. Therefore, later, this water-drinking American was considered by the manager to be the most reusable worker in the entire printing shop. All urgent documents were ordered to be handled by him, because he not only did it better than others, but also did it faster, and his salary was naturally particularly high, so Lincoln's life gradually improved!</p>
<p>Children! Perseverance is the first requirement for success. None of the great men did not struggle from hardship. After reading the anecdotes of Lincoln, how should you encourage yourself to work hard!</p>
<h3>30,000 People Freeze to Death a Year</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Children, this shocking number, maybe you wouldn't know if I didn't mention it, right? In Shanghai, this city, about 30,000 people freeze to death a year, which is really shocking. And among these 30,000 people who froze to death, children account for a large number. Maybe close to ten thousand!</p>
<p>When we go to the streets, we can see people freezing to death lying on the side of the road every day, which is terrible to see. Among them, there are men, women, old, and young. Although some die from illness, most of them freeze to death. These people have no home to return to and no place to complain. It is not without reason that some people go down the path of depravity in order to eat white bread and die without regret, but these people are only a small part after all.</p>
<p>Even if adults don't care about them, but children are pure-hearted, it's not like they all eat white bread, right? So many children die on the road every day due to hunger and cold, isn't it an innocent disaster, and worthy of our sympathy? Therefore, we cannot ignore this issue!</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country. Among these innocent children who freeze to death on the road, there may be those with talent who can be cultivated in the future. Therefore, the more children who die unjustly today, the more national vitality will be lost in the future. Whether from the perspective of sympathy or the perspective of the country, we cannot sit idly by and watch so many children die unjustly, and we should find ways to reduce it.</p>
<p>The above numbers are obtained from the statistics of the Pushan Villa, a charitable organization that specializes in collecting corpses from the streets, and must be quite accurate. Moreover, according to the situation in previous years, the more people die in winter. When a cold spell comes, many people will die. Now, winter is coming again, and the cold is constantly attacking us. Children who freeze to death due to hunger and cold will naturally increase with the degree of cold weather. If you don't want to let children die unjustly like this, in addition to hoping that charitable organizations will provide more relief, you also have to hope that every child can save some candy money to help these poor children. The fewer children who die unjustly, the better. So not only is it disaster relief, it can simply be regarded as saving the country!</p>
<h3>Improved Baked Sweet Potato</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Now I want to talk to you children about eating, which is "Improved Baked Sweet Potato." What is "Improved Baked Sweet Potato?" This is what I invented, let me tell you slowly!</p>
<p>Baked sweet potato is a popular food that fills the streets and alleys now. It is fragrant, sweet, soft, and has an inconspicuous temptation, which is its heat. So it is great to eat when it is cold. Unfortunately, the price is too expensive. A small one sells for 1 jiao, and a larger one costs 2 or 3 jiao. As for raw sweet potatoes, you can buy a jin for only 8 or 9 jiao, so it is best to bake it yourself. But after I baked it several times, it was mostly not thoroughly baked. If I wanted to bake it for a longer time, then the half-raw and half-cooked outer skin would be too burnt to eat. So I was eager to get a wonderful way to bake sweet potatoes myself, and the result was finally satisfactory.</p>
<p>The method: put the washed sweet potatoes in a pot, and cook them like boiled sweet potatoes until all the sweet potatoes are cooked (don't be too soft, otherwise the skin will easily fall off), then take them out and use lead wire clips to put them on the stove to dry, until the skin is like the skin of the baked sweet potatoes sold outside, and then you are successful. Children, think how economical and convenient it is! In addition, there are two points that you should pay attention to: Be careful of the stove fire burning your little hands when you do it. After it is done, let your parents taste the good and big ones first.</p>
<h3>The Phenomenon of Cold</h3>
<p>— Jinzhen</p>
<p>The climate is gradually getting colder with the withering of the trees. The northwest wind blew all day, and a layer of dark clouds densely covered the gloomy sky. Not a ray of sunshine could penetrate through, so the mercury column of the thermometer suddenly dropped to about forty or fifty degrees; it was only ten degrees or so away from the freezing point, and the phenomenon of cold was fully expressed, so the breath exhaled from everyone's mouth turned white; the water pipes in Awei's house were wrapped with straw; the leaves in the garden fell one by one, but the leaves of the pine tree were still green, not afraid of the cold at all; When Awei went to school, he saw beggars trembling and groaning by the road... These special scenes were being played out in front of Awei, and he was asking in his mind "Why?" He thought about it again and again, but he couldn't answer himself, so he had to ask his brother, which was the most convenient.</p>
<p>"Why does the breath we exhale from our mouths turn white in winter? This is because when the climate is cold, the temperature is of course lower than the temperature of our body, and most of the gas exhaled from our mouths is water vapor, which condenses when it encounters the cold air outside and turns into fog, so it looks white. Why do water pipes need to be wrapped with straw? When the temperature drops to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, all water will freeze. There is always water in the water pipes exposed to the air. When the water freezes in the water pipes, it will expand, and this expansion force is very large. If the water pipes are full of water, they will be burst by the expansion, so when it is cold, they must be wrapped with straw, because straw does not conduct cold and heat. Wrapping it outside the water pipes, the cold air cannot freeze the water in the water pipes, and the water pipes will not be burst. Other trees lose their leaves, but why don't pine trees lose their leaves? The composition of pine tree leaves is not much different from the leaves of other deciduous trees. The reason why it does not lose its leaves is that the skin of pine tree leaves is more sticky and tough than other tree leaves, so it can be green even in winter. Don't say that beggars tremble in cold weather, even we will tremble. Why? You must know that this is a natural movement. When trembling in the cold, it can make the muscles of our body move, and at the same time, it can speed up the circulation of blood in the body, and the body will become warmer. This kind of trembling is the same principle as rubbing our hands together or getting up and jumping when our hands are cold to warm our body. The reason why the beggars on the road are trembling is that they don't have thick clothes to wear and no hot food to eat!" Awei's brother solved his four "whys" one by one. Of course, he was very grateful in his heart, but he didn't say it.</p>
<h3>Blind Fish in the Cave</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I participated in the worship of the Hua Dong Baptist Church. That day, Mr. Zhang Chunjiang was responsible for preaching. He quoted an anecdote from his study abroad in the United States in those years to encourage us to have a spirit of unremitting struggle for everything, whether in the academic era or after entering the society. He said: "One day, when I followed a few friends to travel somewhere in the United States, we suddenly entered a deep cave. The cave was pitch black, and the sun could never shine on this corner. There was a small pool under the cave, and several small fish were swimming back and forth in the pool. Strangely, I stared at it and found that none of these fish's eyes were not blind.</p>
<p>"Why are none of these fish's eyes not blind?" Mr. Zhang wanted us to think about it. "Of course, it is because they are in a dark environment all day long, and the function of their eyes has gradually disappeared, resulting in this phenomenon."</p>
<p>Children! Mr. Zhang's narration is a great lesson for us. If we don't use our brains for a day, what will be the difference between the result and the blind fish in the cave?</p>
<p>Children! Please use a pen to black out the black spots to make a picture.</p>

<p>For all kinds of performing arts, if you want to improve, the first thing is to have talents and methods of training talents, which is especially important in the film industry. For example, in the United States, I don't know how many thousands of people hope to become stars, and as a result, hope often turns into dreams. The MGM film company has a famous intelligence appraiser, Edward Gario, who tells people: The opportunity is very important for the election of stars and the success or failure of stars (opportunity is like our country's saying of fate). He cited the following examples of big stars:</p>
<p>Myrna Loy: Before becoming famous, she was a minimal character. It was not until a new director discovered that her face had natural beauty and her actions were natural, and he took a fancy to her, so she went smoothly and achieved today's status.</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan is a famous "Oomph" girl. Her fame relied on a journalist inventing a new word OOMPH.</p>
<p>How did Dorothy Lamour become famous? When the star test was held, the director suddenly stopped testing other actresses and paid special attention to Miss Dorothy in the crowd. Therefore, her fame rose sharply and her luck was high.</p>
<p>The examiners of Hollywood star exams believe that frontal tests may not be perfect, so there is another method of side knocking, which has also discovered many talents.</p>
<p>Tyrone Power and Sonja Henie are both famous people who failed the initial test. Before joining 20th Century Fox, Betty Grable had failed the exams of two film companies. Linda Darnell was recognized by the director a year after the exam. It can be seen that the rise and fall of movie stars in the film city depends on their acting skills and physical beauty, but the fate of good and bad luck is also an important key.</p>
<h3>Discovering New Talents from the Stage</h3>
<p>— Ciping</p>
<p>Yan Jun Joins the National Federation</p>
<p>Not long ago, film companies were in excessive demand in order to increase production, but due to the lack of actors, it was not enough to distribute them, and there was an outcry for an actor shortage. Therefore, various companies set up actor training classes, etc., to greatly promote new people, but the new people who graduated from the training classes, the achievements on the silver screen are simply rare. Most of the red stars on the screen today are still discovered from the stage. Han Fei was one of them not long ago.</p>
<p>Recently, Yan Jun, a popular young actor on the stage who played in "Metamorphosis" at the Carlton, has recently joined China's largest Lianying Film Company with the introduction of Yan Ciping. Jun has been appreciated and valued by producer Zhang Shankun. He signed a formal contract in the Lilac Garden yesterday. It is said that the first year is a series of films, and four films will be shot on a special contract within a year, with a remuneration of 1,200 to 1,600 yuan per film. The National Federation Company has many young and beautiful female stars who are enough to attract people, such as Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Tong Yuejuan, Yuan Meiyun, Gu Lanjun, Wang Xichun, etc., but there are very few male actors who are healthy and of the right height. Now Yan Jun's joining the National Federation Company is to strengthen the lineup of male actors in the National Federation, so that female actors are not allowed to be beautiful in the front, so the National Federation is gradually strengthening.</p>
<h3>Deanna Durbin's New Film After Marriage</h3>
<p>It was previously reported that Deanna Durbin had disagreements with the Universal Film Company and had terminated the contract. According to a sea letter received from New York, this is not true. The original letter stated that Deanna Durbin still has a four-year contract with the company. During this period, she can only make films for Universal, so new films will be continuously shipped to China. The one that will arrive in Shanghai soon is "Paul" co-starred with Charles Laughton.</p>
<h3>Franke Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>The Chinese Film Academy has decided to start recruiting students in early November. Therefore, the president of the academy, Franke, specially hosted fellow journalists at the Huizhong Hotel at noon yesterday. He also invited them to visit the academy site at 994 Xiahui Road beforehand and discussed the direction of the "Film Academy" on the spot. Newcomers from the industry provided many opinions. According to Franke, a famous European director with decades of experience in film art, "Children of the World," which was recently screened in the United Nations, is his first work in China.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Jingyi</p>
<p>Yao Yiwu's script "Yuan Shikai" written for Shangzhi has been completely completed and will be performed after the next new play "Xian Yuan."</p>
<p>The Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan brothers discussed with the owner of the National Federation and decided to continue drawing the second full-length cartoon, the theme of which has been set as "Red Boy," because Red Boy is the son of "Princess Iron Fan." Also, Wan's youngest brother, Chao Chan, has also joined the National Federation Cartoon Department. From now on, the three brothers will work together.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng is producing a war film "Eternal Glory" for Daguan Film in Hong Kong, starring Bai Yang, Feng Zi, and Gao Zhanfei. The film has a great air force scene, which is rare in domestic films.</p>
<p>Gong Jianong has accepted Wu Cun's invitation and is scheduled to go to Batavia in early November. It is said that Gong will play the male lead in "Defending the Dutch East Indies" directed by Wu.</p>
<p>Minhua's another great work, "An Enchanting Beauty," will start filming on the 5th of next month. The male lead has been set as Huang He, and the female lead will be Sun Jinglu. In addition to director Fei Mu, Jiang Qifeng and Sima Yingcai will also serve as assistant directors.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Due to the fatigue of the journey, she has extended her leave from the National Federation for a week. Wan Cang is currently rushing to complete the filming work for her new work "Private Love."</p>
<p>There is news from Chen Yunshang that Tan Ying will return to Shanghai within the year to rejoin the film industry.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Huichong, if his new work "Wu Xiong After the Robbery" can be completed within the year, he will perform magic for a week at the Great Shanghai Theater on New Year's Day of the Gregorian calendar. The wonderful programs include water escape and fire escape performances.</p>
<p>"Home" has been scheduled to be screened at the Shanghai Guangtong Theater on New Year's Day of the Gregorian calendar, and the ticket price will not increase.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk, the Dust of the Nomad Cavalry Fills the City</p>
<p>As they were talking, the golden drums shook loudly, and shouts rose up. Zhang Cangqiu and others had already crossed the river from the front. Liu Yining immediately got on his horse, and Xu Jing also followed suit. Everyone turned around and killed them, sweeping away the fleeing bandits. Seven or eight out of ten bandits were killed or wounded, and the rest fled with Li Yan. Xu Jing, Liu Yining, Zhang Cangqiu, and Chen Fei joined forces, and they were very happy. They pursued and killed them for a while, and took Luanzhou by force. The sky was bright, so they collected the troops to appease the people, and then picked up Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong to cross the river and rest for a day. Xu Jing and Liu Yining's troops were stationed in the Xuantan Temple in the north of the city. Liu Yining was resting on the kang, and Xu Jing went to Bai Xianzong to get gold wound medicine. Bai Xianzong knew about it and came to comfort him. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei also came to visit. Knowing that Liu Yining's injury was still light, they were relieved a lot and praised Liu Yining's ability to bravely kill the bandits. After sitting for a while, they heard that Wu Sangui had led his troops into the city, so they hurried to see Sangui, so they left. At dusk, Xu Jing returned to the temple alone and saw Liu Yining sleeping alone in the room. A candle as thick as an arm was lit on the table, and there was silence, with only two soldiers standing outside the door, serving Liu Yining. When Liu Yining saw Xu Jing come back, he said, "Brother Jing is back? Is General Wu about to advance? We must use our own strength to defeat the bandits, and don't rely on the strength of others." Xu Jing said, "Yes." He sat down on the edge of the kang. He also said, "General Wu said that he will advance the day after tomorrow. Tonight, he left us to drink in the camp. He knew that you were injured by an arrow when you crossed the river to kill the bandits, and he taught me to comfort you. Tomorrow morning, he will also send officials to comfort you." (23)</p>
