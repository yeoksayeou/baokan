<h3 id="c14">泛論民生與物價嚴重關捩 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>滬市爲遠東唯一自由角逐之國際市塲，而亦爲世界繁華優游之樂土。且以其環境之特殊與便利，世界任何一隅縱有浩刦或値經濟恐慌，滬市宛如世外桃源，得免池魚之殃及，而使市民繼續其安居樂業之生活。二年以前之滬市，衡之以食米（僅十二元一石），煤球（僅二元一擔）與一般物價之低廉，足徵此特殊之國際都會得置身事外，而絕不受任何惡劣之影響。</p>
<p>乃自去年起，食米首先自每石十數元一躍而爲數十元。再一躍而達今春之一百五十元。其他物價，遂一致在漲，舉凡有食米之爲成本因素者，靡不踵接提高；而社會之糾紛於是層出不窮。勞方罷工以要挾加薪，資方加薪而再度提高物價，循環轉嫁，互爲因果。誠不知伊於胡底！</p>
<p>晚近，米價　受工部局洋米之限制而趨穩定，但此固僅可視爲暫時之現象。即假令米價得常維持一百十六元之水準亦斷非市民所能永久勝任。稍知各國經濟實况者必不河漢斯言，今姑略舉數點於下，以明眞相。</p>
<p>考各國家庭之食米或麵包消費。皆由政府統制，的佔普通收人自十分之一至三十分之一不等。凡獲有月薪二百元至四百元者。對於按月支出二十元之麵包或食米，尙能應付裕如。反觀今日我國之大衆人民，若月獲一百元者，尙不敷一石米之代價，其薪水較高之絕少數人民，亦必感受食米消費之威脅。度必佔其收人五分之一以至半數左右，而其他種種開支尙須羅掘彌補也。或謂此嚴重局面皆由於滬市物價使然。誠然，但此愈反證今日滬市物價之不當，而須予以嚴厲之糾正，蓋即就受戰事影響之各國言，無一地域之糧食物價有超過我國者。近在咫尺之香港普通食米，每石僅爲十二元至十四元港幣，其佔香港市民收入百分之幾，可以設想。日本東京米近月來每石僅爲日金四十三元左右。日本之麵粉每袋官價爲日金五元五角八分，而滬市每袋爲三十三元許。日本之煤近來每噸爲日金二十七元七角，而滬市今日之煤價每噸的四百數十元。再觀較遠之英國倫敦近日之麵粉價，每二百八十磅爲二十五先令半，若照近日匯率三便士四分之一計，每磅僅合法幣三角三分，而滬市麵粉每磅則爲法幣七角，尙貴一倍餘。况兩地生活費用必須依照本國之貨幣收支計算，始可爲準確之比較。按倫敦麵粉每磅之一便士代價，直與我人一分錢之揮霍無異，其負擔之輕能不令人艷羨。倫敦近日最佳之煤每噸為三十二先令許，合法幣僅一百二十元許，比滬市煤價低廉二倍餘；若以各本國貨幣收支爲百分之比較，滬市煤價將超過倫敦十五倍許。倫敦近日最上品牛肉，由遠東以及其屬地輸入者，每八磅爲五先令四便士，每磅爲八便士，合法幣二元半，較諸滬市每磅之四元已低廉一倍，而按諸實際生活程度，彼八便士之開支猶等於我人八分錢之値耳。總之，所有倫敦或其他各國日用品之物價，或折合法幣計算，或以實際收支百分率比較，無不較滬市低廉倍蓰</p>
<p>爲使便於把握各國生活實况，今請略言生活指數。考世界交戰國與非交戰國之生活指數，大致變動極微，母待贅述。英國過去數年中逐年提高僅百分之一左右，至去年始提高百分之十七，指數爲二三。日本近年來逐年僅提高百分之十三，至去年不過提高百分之十六，指數爲一三九。惟我國逐年提高甚速，至最近二年，逐年竟遞加一倍許，指數爲六一五。若單就糧食一項編製指數，各國逐年遞加之數更爲微細，至多的百分之一左右，惟獨我國則反其道而行之，竟構成指數七〇〇之高峯。若將指數繪圖表現，各國之指數均爲平行綫或稍有波盪之平行綫，惟獨我國則爲六十角度之直綫，由此可見近年來各國之生活程度皆遠不及我國之高也。我國以農立國，日用品絕無匱乏之虞。自歐戰爆發以還，我國並輸出大量農產品，何以日用品價格飛漲一至於此，而反超過東西各國之市價。此無他，蓋由於龐大組織之操縱壟斷有以致之，毫無疑義。即以向各國輸入之食米言，若照產地低廉之米價出售，而無囤積居奇之作祟，今日之米價每石至多不過四十元而已，觀諸香港與日本之米價，當可知斯言之不謬也。</p>
<p>再觀近日來公共車資，水電費，人力車租，以及公務人員之薪水等，無不在挣扎提高其價格與待遇，而究其提高之理由，厥維來源稀少與成本提高，對於是類請求，際茲米珠薪桂，凡爲市民，當可諒其苦衷。惟公用事業之性質與食米等之有關民生，初無二致。故其增價之提議在各國必先經代表人民之社團爲之愼重審查，並使民衆出席參加討論，而定其增價之當吾。蓋公用事業之成功，得力於經營者僅屬一部份，而泰半須歸功於社會之扶助，是故公用事業絕不能如其他私有企業得坐收高厚之利潤。而必須符合取之於民而用之於民之原則。若僅視其成本之是否增加，而遽由執行機關核准其所請，則手續旣失之於不當而與各國處理公用事業之原則復大相背馳，此在市民不能不引爲遺憾而望有關當局予以合埋之糾正。</p>
<p>綜上以言，由於物價之繼續在漲，市民生計，已陷於極度之窘迫處境，而物價之所以在漲，實由於當局之未能予以及時之統制使然。雖然，孤島具有特殊之國際性，而當局亦自有其苦衷，但孤島仍不失為遠東之樂土，則中外人士固所公認，苟能不分畛域，協謀整個滬市之安定，勿爲舍本逐末之舉，勿爲過份利已之圖，則物價自可漸决導入正軌，而民生問題之解決，庶有豸乎！</p>

<p>路透社十四日倫敦電　柏林無錢電台昨夜廣播、以斯達林陣綫之被衝破、擬諸促使法國崩潰的魏剛陣綫之突破、據稱、魏剛陣綫旣被突破、法國之抵抗、遂被完全擊潰、其崩潰乃不可免、歷史豈不應重演於東歐戰事乎、民衆不盡明瞭德軍對蘇勝利之重大意義、故宜將此比諸去歲之對法戰事、斯達林陣錢在若干地點深度似達三十二哩、德軍衝破此綫、已獲決定戰局之轉捩點、而對布爾希維克主義作戰之勝利、可操左券云、</p>

<p>路透社十四日倫敦電　德方所傳東綫勝利之消息、此間雖未能予以證實、但信德人或稍有進展、納粹最危險之威脅、似在對列寗格勒之進攻、惟傳蘇軍現正從事調整其在貝薩拉比亞之陣綫、據昨晚莫斯科之公報、與德軍所傳大獲勝利之說、殊相矛盾、因其謂前綫兩軍之地位並無多大變化也、</p>

<p>但此次增加過鉅恐難復原狀</p>

<p>兩學生闖入鄰居行刦果然成功</p>
<p>向銀行提款被捕供出刦財動機</p>
<p>小說與戲劇、雖能導人於善、而有時亦能使人誤入歧途、致觸犯法紀、即如轟動社會之周氏兄弟殺父巨案、據被吿等之供詞、亦稱係研究電學入迷、致作此大逆不道之罪行、更有一般年靑子弟、中神怪小說之迷、竟背離家庭、赴深山求道等情、層出不窮、茲又有靑年學子二人、因平時喜讀偵探小說、竟運用小說上之種種技巧、作盜賊行爲、其經過情形、殊堪一述、</p>
<p>研習偵探圖試身手</p>
<p>緣有閩人王世偉、現年十七歲、家住靜安寺路靜安別墅廿二號、現在某敎會大學肄業、其父任職於政界、且富於資財、而王素喜閱讀偵探小說、竟致入迷、有住居梧州路三百三十一號在華童公學肄業之本地人宋頌德（亦十七歲）、與王前曾同學、且同屬偵探迷、二人旣屬友好、復屬志同道合、於是即共同商議一施身手、會有已適韓人黃某之名交際花張瑛（綽號刀疤老六）者、住於王家對門卅四號門牌、二人即以黃張瑛爲目標、</p>
<p>效法俠盜亞森羅蘋</p>
<p>王宋兩人、於月之八日、在博物院路光陸大戲院內商議進行方法、效法俠盜亞森羅蘋、從事行刦、然後將刦得之款、捐助於慈善機關、經縝密之商議與研究結果、於月之十二日晨八時、在西摩路平安大戲院門首會集、拂有假手槍一支、刺刀一柄、繩索多根、橡皮膏數張、並爲使事主不能認出廬山眞面目計、除各戴眼鏡一付外、王世偉並戴嘴套、更爲避免遺留指印、故二人手指均戴有橡皮指套、更爲移轉警務人員之目標、王更藏白蘭地酒一瓶、</p>
<p>闖入居戶刦得鉅值</p>
<p>佈置旣畢、遂同往靜安別墅卅四號、以送報爲由、騙開後門後、即將開門之女傭雙目貼以橡皮膏、再以手帕塞入其口、復用繩索將手足綑縛、步登二樓余文榮之住所、以同樣方法、將佘及其妻綑縛、刦其所藏法幣四百餘元、日幣百餘元、及掛表一只、再上三樓黃張瑛之臥室、亦予綑縛、即從容搜刦、將其存靜安寺路四明銀行九千五百八十五元六角存摺一扣、南京路永豐裕金號六千元存摺一扣、以及首飾法幣等、共値一萬七千元刦得、</p>
<p>飲酒娛樂從容逸去</p>
<p>當時二人在房人飲酒吸烟、開聽無綫電、歷時達二小時餘、始　贓而去、事後經靜安寺捕房得報、立飭華探長蔣上佩·朱積煌·探目倪家鳳·探員鮮承明等、馳往調查、因王宋二人計劃周密、爲歷來盜案中所無、故一時未能獲得錢索、因刦物中有存摺二扣、乃至銀行守候、至十三日王果携存摺至四明銀行提款、遂遭弋獲、旋至共家、查獲假手槍·刺刀·及全部贓物、此時宋忽前來、乃爲探一併拘獲、</p>
<p>提款被拘坦白直認</p>
<p>昨晨解送特一法院刑二庭、捕房律師張天蔭陳明經過情形、以被吿等在事主家內、遺有酒瓶之目的、實欲使探員誤認犯案者必係一酒鬼、而不注意及彼等也、詰之二被吿、均坦白直認、並稱、渠等家均富有、非困於資者、此决行刦、實係中偵探小說之迷、且刦得之款、擬捐助於兒童敎養院云云、被吿之律師蔣保釐姜屏藩請求庭上飭探至被告家中搜查、是吾有偵探小說、因據王世偉稱、現存之偵探小說達四十餘　也、經石美瑜推事向兩事主偵訊之下、諭令王宋二人押候改期再訊、並令捕房人員至兩被吿家中、搜查楚吾藏有大量偵探小說、</p>

<p>人心虛慌至於極低價迭見　美軍防護最有力市面始安</p>
<p>紗市先跌後昂、趨勢則紊亂不一、此因申新二九兩廠有被接收問題、紗市塲上、受此緊張空氣之激盪、致投機者心神恍惚、握貨（多頭）者誠恐出不到貨、而另生枝節、紛紛拋售、（反多爲空）二十支雙馬紗廠單開盤即被壓小爲一千五百三十元、最低曾小至五百二十元左右、（有喊十五元行情者）、同時客幫鑒於環境如此惡劣、亦畏縮不動、因之交易大爲淸淡、廣幫僅辦三二支金寳星三十包、其他未曾成交、可想人氣散漫一斑、大戶因原料問題、依然吸收、於是一般空虛之氣、轉弱爲强、然上下範圍、日見擴大、有四五十元之起伏、二十支雙馬高價爲一千五百六十八元、低價爲一千五百二十元、午後初做價爲一千五百七十元、跌至一千五百五十七元、最後價爲一千五百六十九元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開雖有哈華托律師爲申新二九廠產權通吿、解釋羣疑、但人心依然惶恐萬狀、塲上大都傾向拋出、伸手一致向外、首盤價爲一千五百三十元、然叫喊出者叢集、少頃跌至一千五百二十二元、惟某記大戶照市收進、額數較巨、同時多說廠方並非共事、並聞美國防軍已入廠保護、人心重振、買氣轉濃、形勢較緊、市盤徐徐回昂至一千五百六十五元、但實際交易亦停滯、不過有一批獲利者扒補、收盤價爲一千五百六十八元、查半日間成交統計四千〇三十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>金雙馬期紗市况、初因盛傳華商申新第二及第九兩紗廠有被某方接收之謠、故一般執有雙馬廠單之多頭、俱現恐慌、並聞雙馬廠單開盤突降三十一元、因此金雙馬開盤多頭羣起了結、空戶乘虛壓迫、七月期開盤遂猛落三十四元、價做一千三百八十元、八月期稍緩和、略跌九元、詎拍至九月期、蓋某項全係謠傳、全非事實、新買戶與補空漸增、忽漲十三元、入後因外滙與金價尙安定、業外商不斷猛吸、步開步高、午收七月期漲七元、八月期漲十八元、九月期漲二十元、近遠月已相差九十二元之多、上午成交一萬七千二百二十包、後市趨勢極平穩、價則近高遠平、結果七月期比上日漲十二元、八月期漲十七元半、九月期漲二十七元、全日共成交二萬四千一百七十包、比上日增加一萬一千九百九十包、再將全日開收高低價錄左（係凈盤叫價）</p>

<p>有些初入社會的靑年，往往表示悲觀，以爲天下烏鴉一般黑，四顧茫茫，黯淡無光。其實並不盡然。社會固然有黑黯的地方，也有光明的一面。</p>
<p>請看此决本報發起申報讀者助學金，一呼百應，自動捐款者絡繹不絕，三日間已收到一千餘元。特別令人感動的，是這些捐款的人，多非殷富者流。有初出大學之門的靑年，獨捐百元，並指定幫助倪君每學期百元，直到高中畢業爲止。有女生五十九人，合捐一百元。還有一位舊書攤主，願意幫助兩位淸寒免費生在立達學園求學期間的全部書籍。這種熱誠，充分地表現了人類互助精神的偉大。本報同人，願意在各位讀者的督促與指導之下，分出一部份的精神與時間，來替讀者辦理這件事，務使人類互助的精神，更得以發揚廣大。</p>
<p>今日的社會上，每個人在直接或間接上可說都是受到別人的精神的或物質的幫助，才得有今日的成就與地位的。感恩圖報，是人同此心的。我們覺得替社會栽植未來的人才，是最適當與最有意義的報答，也是一件最值得一做的事情，希望各界人士羣起響應。</p>

<h3 id="c94">啞子能言 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 江新亮</p>
<p>「啞子吃黃連，有苦說不出；」這兩句話表現了啞子是可憐的東西。如今雖也有啞子學校，不幸生爲啞子的，同樣也有受敎育的機會；但在事實上，他們內心的創痛與苦悶，的確是萬難以筆墨形容一二的。</p>
<p>我們很久很久渴望着能够有這樣一位科學家或醫生出來，他可以治得好「啞病」，可以叫啞子也會開口說話。最近消息傳來，據說在美國西雅圖地方，果眞有一位名叫金白利安博士（Dr.Brian　T.King）的，他能够把啞子頸部的肌肉與神經重新整理一番，而使聲帶與咽喉上那些失掉了控制的肌肉，再度緊張起來。</p>
<p>截至目前止，已經有二十六個病人上他那裹去醫治過。這二十六人中，有的祇會作些沙沙聲，有的簡直一個音都說不出來；結果呢，其中有二十一個人終於能够用嘴巴來說話了。有一個七十四歲的女人，從前老是「默默無聲」的，現在居然說來完全像普通人一樣。有一位三十五歲的，總計啞了十七年，如今却在一個學校裏當敎師了。芝加哥美國醫學會有一位女書記，也由金博士動了手術，而獲得了「說話」的權利，她最近曾在美國東南部外科協會會議席上作過一篇相當長的演講，她說來旣淸楚，又動人，當時簡直沒一個人會相信她從前乃是一個「啞子」的。</p>
<p>金博士治啞的手術，非常複雜；但最要緊的一點，就是把那種正常的，活動的咽喉肌肉拿來拼在無力的聲帶上。他相信：如此一定能够造成一種悅耳的，有規律的聲音。</p>
<p>除了金博士之外，努力於治啞的，還有美國寺院大學的敎授李文博士（Dr.Nathaniel　Levin）。他經過三年不斷的研究，也曾使三十餘個沒有喉頭的男子在短期問內會得說話了。他所應用的，乃是一種所謂「吐氣發音」的方法。他使空氣從病人的口部打進去，然後再由腹部逼迫出來，當急促的空氣碰撞在牙齒上時，聲音就成功了。</p>
<p>在這裏，讓我們熱切地希望在最近的將來，天下不再有啞子。我相信：一定有許多天才與偉人會從這不幸的人羣中發現的！</p>

<p>羅斯福總統每在演說前，必作充分的準備。他先把演詞的要點，說話時採取的聲調，以及自己所要用的重要語句或段落等，交給他的助手們，然後由他們各人依此起稿，待各人完稿後，他就命他最信任的打字員脫雷（Grace　tully）把每篇都打字打好。他還要花二整晚的工夫，把每篇都讀讀看，直要到我着一篇最順最口滿意的稿子爲止。草稿旣已揀定，接着他就在他的顧問或屬下前練習，遇有不妥處，隨時改正。</p>
<p>凡要提起外交方面的事務時，他必採取國務卿赫爾的意見，但有時候也常請敎於副國務卿威爾斯或其他各部官員如貝爾（Adolf　Berle）及馬發（Pierrepoint　Mofate）等。</p>
<p>貝爾的特長是，能在演詞中補揷尊嚴的詞調；赫爾常喜用警策語，允能引用簡明的例子來解釋事實。威爾斯是南美事情的專家，他常常供給一些銳利動人的語調，使全篇文字生色不少。</p>
<p>這樣經各人穿揷及補充後的草稿，就成爲羅斯福正式的演說詞，講起來定能中肯入耳，萬無一失的了。</p>

<p>各國第五縱隊的恐怖愈來愈甚。當間諜的人祇耍備有短波無綫電發報機一具，便可以在無論何時向全世界任何地點發送消息。構造一座電力强大的短波電台的成本，不過英金幾磅。五瓦特電力的一套發報機件，能播送消息到令歐各處。若要和附近的四周通訊，有一套一瓦特至二瓦特雷力的機件，就可應付裕如。</p>
<p>希特勒在德國創辦了科學化的「間諜訓練學校」，校中設有特別的一系，專門訓練學生使用短波發報機。受過敎育而有特別技能的管理員，正在應用具體而微的無綫雷台，因此德國接到的秘密電訊，日見增多。這事已有官方的報吿，可資佐證。</p>
<p>現在一個間諜能够混在人羣之中，寫寫意意地用手輕叩機件，傳達消息。他的發報機是藏在大模大樣的手杖中，或者甚至於一隻香烟盒中，眞可謂巧小玲瓏。英國跑馬塲中曾發現過若干間諜，正在使用藏在衣裂中的袖珍發報機，不幸當塲被捕。</p>

<p>十　慈父的心</p>
<p>「去年夏天，不是有一個姓趙的伯父來過嗎？他在我們家裏住了一夜儘和你說着關於媽的話。他說媽曾經好幾决派人上我們先前住的李家莊去找過我們，還在什麼報上登過兩封信，敎我們去找她；趙伯伯：也說，我們應該趕快去找媽，大家住進城裏去，快快活活的過日子。可是你再也不聽，一直對他搖頭嘆氣，後來爽快還逼着他不許把我們住的地名吿訴她。你說媽一來，你就逃走。第二天，我跟你一說，你就耍我一個人跟趙伯父去找媽，把你和小狗子丟在鄉下，這樣做別說趙伯父不贊成，我也怎麼能依呢……？」</p>
<p>梅寳精神抖擻地說了這一大篇話，倒把秋海棠說得垂着頭，一聲不發的像暈過去一樣了</p>
<p>「爸爸，我眞不懂，你說你和媽爲着一件事大大的吵了一次架，所以分手了；那末你爲什麼又要時常惦記着她，還一個人偷偷地流淚呢？再聽那個趙伯父說，媽也天天在想我們。這樣說，你們原不曾吵過什麼架啊！爸爸，對不對？」她一面說，一面用力搖撼着她父親的身體，恨不得敎他立刻答復出來。</p>
<p>但秋海棠却還像木雞似的呆立着，從他傘上掉下去的水滴，打在梅寳頭上，他也沒有覺察。「旣然不曾吵過架，媽回來你爲什麼要逃走啊？爸爸，你爲什麼不許啖？爸爸，你說啊！你快說啊！」她差不多啊把秋海棠推倒了。</p>
<p>她的聲音巳經喊得很響了，但秋海棠却完全像不聽得一樣。</p>
<p>「爸爸，你怎麼不說啊……？」梅寳爽快嚎啕大哭起來了。「你……你別的……待我都好……，只是……只是你……不……不……肯把媽……找……找回來……，我們還有什麼快活……　活呢？」</p>
<p>直到梅寶伏在他半腰裏哭了好一會，他的知覺似乎才回復了。</p>
<p>「梅寳，你是不懂得的！」他用一種很低的聲音輕輕地說，完全像說夢話一樣。「我們要是眞把她找了回來，你果然是快活了，我或要也可以比現在更高興一些；但她自己却再沒有一些樂趣了！」</p>
<p>他忘記了天空裏還在不斷落下來的大雨，突然把雨傘丟到了路旁去，騰出了雙手來，緊緊地摟着他的女兒；用不到他們父女倆閉上眼睛，羅湘綺的幻影，已在雨絲裏再沉再浮的湧出來了。（第十章完）　（一五八）</p>

<h3 id="c101">我於「清宮怨」的觀感 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>天風劇社準備在十七日起上演一個歷史劇，劇名「清宮怨」，由姚克編劇，舒適慕容婉兒主演。全劇的主題是戊戌政變和光緒帝與珍妃間的戀愛史。因爲我曾經在戰前先後繙譯過德齡女士的兩部關於淸宮的作品，－御香縹緲錄與瀛台泣血記－多少對於當時的史實下過幾許研究工夫，所以姚克兄要我就劇本的編製，發表一些意見。其實我可以發表的意見眞是有限得很，但劇本却已「先睹爲快」了。</p>
<p>生意眼的動機</p>
<p>關於淸朝末葉的史劇，趣味的集中點，過去似乎都在西太后一個人身上；從「安德海大鬧龍舟」起，一直到「東太后與西太后」之類，渲染的無非是一個年紀越老，越被人家傳說得風流俊俏的老寡婦。我不敢說這些劇作者個個都患着高度的「意淫」症，但有一點是可以決定的，那就是他們編劇的動機太注重了生意眼，而他們所集取的材料，也只限於什麼宮圍秘史和一般毫無根據的傳說，所以根本不是歷史劇，只是一種「幻想」劇！</p>
<p>何必當刀寳貨</p>
<p>有一個時期，我聽見好幾個劇團搶着要搬演一西太后」，而且據說某一位劇作家已經開始在動筆了；我常時覺得很奇怪，「難道西太后也可以演成葛嫩娘第二，洪宜嬌第二嗎？」當然，我自己也知道讀書有限，所見不廣，說不定我所認爲一生無大功過，只知道儘發一般老太太常有的那股强脾氣的西太后，在別人心目中，也許是一個了不起的女英雄；也許我以爲她的魄力和才美都不及則大金輪大帝的百分之一，而別人却以爲她遠在武氏之上，所以耍把她當做寳貨一樣的搬上舞台去了。但後來，感謝上帝，劇本終於不曾編出來。大概人的見解總有幾分相同吧？</p>
<p>西太后不足道</p>
<p>可是一個朝代的末落，尤其像清朝這一座天下的斷送，當然有共可歌可泣的事蹟的（明末遺恨就是一個例）；除掉西太后之外，淸朝末葉難道就沒有第二個人値得搬上舞台嗎？西太后的一生，固然沒有什麼可以稱道，但其他的人，難道都跟她一樣庸碌嗎？我差不多時常在這樣的想。而且同時往往要連帶的想起光緒，－那個本可大有作爲，而爲惡勢力所生生扼死的靑年皇帝，－以及他所畢生眷戀的珍妃。</p>
<p>此劇無懈可擊</p>
<p>可惜我從不曾研究過劇本的寫作，因此雖有這種理想，而自己却無法使它實現；但我必須承認，姚克編寫這一部「淸宮怨」的劇本，無論在取材上，結構上，以及穿揷上，已經完全合符我的理想了。甚至還要好一些！所以當我看完了他的劇本以後，我就給了他四個字的批評：「無懈可擊」。全劇連序幕在內，共五慕九塲，戲相當的長；主角光緒和珍妃兩人，幕幕有戲，塲塲吃重，因此我想這兩個角色的人選，大概很不容易找吧？－現在聽說已決定由舒適和慕容婉兒担任，成績如何，那要待演出以後再說了。</p>

<p>Abandoning Extraterritoriality, Returning Concessions, and Revising Treaties</p>
<p>To Consult with China Once the Far East War is Settled</p>
<p>Chongqing: Following the exchange of notes between U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Foreign Minister Guo, in which the U.S. agreed to consult with the Chinese government after the restoration of peace in the Far East to abolish American consular jurisdiction in China and revise unequal treaties, the British government has also formally expressed to China its willingness to consult, after the settlement of the war in the Far East, on abolishing consular jurisdiction in China, returning concessions, and revising unequal treaties. The exchange of notes between the two parties is recorded below:</p>
<p>Translation of Ambassador Kerr's note dated July 4th: Your Excellency, I have the honor, by order of His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform Your Excellency that, when peace has been restored in the Far East, the British Government is willing to discuss with the Chinese Government the abolition of extraterritorial rights (Editor's note: referring to consular jurisdiction), the return of concessions, and the revision of treaties on the basis of equality and reciprocity. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration. To His Excellency Guo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of the Republic of China, Kerr, July 4, 1941.</p>
<p>July 12th, Foreign Minister Guo replied: Your Excellency, I acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note of July 4th, stating that the British Government intends to discuss with the Chinese Government the abolition of consular jurisdiction, the return of concessions, and the revision of treaties on the basis of reciprocity and equality when peace has been restored in the Far East, which has been duly noted. The Chinese Government expresses its deep appreciation for this friendship of the British Government and should like to request that it be noted. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration. To His Excellency Sir Kerr, British Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China, July 11, 1941. (Telegraph from the 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It has recently been announced that the Chinese and British governments have formally exchanged notes, with Britain agreeing to negotiate the abolition of consular jurisdiction, the return of concessions, and the revision of treaties on an equal and reciprocal basis when peace is restored in the Far East. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Kerr stated in his note delivered to Foreign Minister Guo on October 4th, "I am instructed by the Foreign Secretary of my country to inform Your Excellency that, as soon as peace is restored in the Far East, the British Government will be prepared to negotiate with Your Government the abolition of consular jurisdiction, the return of concessions, and the revision of treaties on an equal and reciprocal basis." Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi replied on July 12th, "The Chinese Government is deeply grateful for this expression of friendship from the British Government." (Reuters telegraph from the 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The exchange of notes between China and Britain has now been published. The document sent by British Ambassador Kerr to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was issued on the 4th of this month, while the Ministry's reply was issued on the 12th. Ambassador Kerr's message stated, "As soon as peace is restored in the Far East, the British Government is prepared to discuss the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, and the revision of various treaties on the basis of reciprocity and equality." Foreign Minister Guo's reply, in addition to quoting the original text, stated, "I reply to Your Excellency that the Chinese Government is extremely grateful for this expression of friendship from the British Government." The entire text is relatively brief, which is different from the exchange of notes with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. This is an unprecedented diplomatic victory for China since the start of the war. Public and private figures here are all greatly relieved. (Havas telegraph from the 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It was learned today that the newly appointed Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi notified British Ambassador Sir Archibald Kerr on July 12th that China is extremely grateful for Britain's expression of willingness to negotiate the abolition of extraterritorial rights after the restoration of peace. The British Ambassador notified China of Britain's intentions in a special dispatch on July 4th, the content of which is the same as the American promise to begin negotiations to abolish extraterritorial rights and revise treaties. The British Ambassador's dispatch stated, "I am instructed by the Foreign Secretary to notify Your Excellency that my government is prepared to negotiate with the Chinese government the abolition of consular jurisdiction after the restoration of peace in the Far East." Foreign Minister Guo replied, "I respectfully reply that the Chinese government is deeply grateful for the British government's expression of friendship." At the same time, it is understood that the Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association sent a telegram to Churchill on the fourth anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War, praising the British for their heroic fighting and stating, "China is Britain's most reliable ally in the Far East, therefore we hope that Britain will completely embargo Japan. If China receives the active assistance of Britain and the United States, it will be able to eliminate the threat of Japan on its own as soon as possible." (United Press telegraph from the 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Sichuan Furong Salt Fields Planning to Improve Production and Sales <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Adopting Scientific Methods for Brine Extraction and Salt Production</p>
<p>Actively Developing Water Conservancy to Facilitate Salt Transportation</p>
<p>Chongqing: Ziliujing Dispatch: The Furong Salt Fields in Sichuan Province produce approximately ×× ten thousand dan of salt annually, accounting for half of the province's total output. However, the cost of salt production was gradually increasing before the war, and after the war, due to the rising prices of raw materials and tools, the cost became even higher. In light of this, the salt fields are striving to improve, with the aim of reducing costs. (1) Regarding brine extraction, the traditional methods that still rely on oxen to extract brine are in need of improvement. Even the wells that use new methods to extract brine with locomotives are often dangerous, as the existing locomotive boilers have mostly been in use for more than fifteen years, requiring frequent repairs and being prone to explosions. In addition, setting up furnaces at each well is wasteful of coal and iron, and is very uneconomical. There are plans to establish two ×× kilowatt power plants in ×× to transmit electricity to Ziliujing, so that all brine extraction at the wells in the eastern and western fields can be converted to electricity, saving coal and iron and reducing costs. (2) Regarding salt production, it is planned to encourage collective salt production, using improved flat-bottomed pans or vacuum tube salt production, which can reduce costs and improve salt quality. The currently produced Ba salt is popular among salt merchants and the people due to its ease of transportation. However, the manufacturing cost of Ba salt is higher than that of Hua salt, so there is a push to switch entirely to producing Hua salt, and then use a high-pressure machine to compress the Hua salt into salt bricks to facilitate transportation and reduce costs. As for the fire wells, it is also planned to organize a natural gas factory to concentrate the gas, add pressure and appropriate air to allow it to burn thoroughly, reducing consumption. Currently, the most uneconomical aspect of salt production is the wasteful use of heat, the failure to fully utilize residual heat, and the lack of knowledge about concentrating the brine to reduce heat consumption. Therefore, the fields are building □ frame strips to use sunlight and wind to concentrate the brine, and building tower furnace stoves to use residual heat from the chimneys to preheat the brine. If the experimental charcoal stoves are successful, the fire stoves will also be imitated. If the utilization of residual heat and concentration can both be effective, then the amount of Lu used for salt production each month can be reduced by about one-tenth compared to the past, equivalent to about 10,000 metric tons. (3) Regarding transportation, the transportation of Furong salt currently relies on waterways. However, the main waterways, the Weiyuan River and the Jing River, suffer from insufficient water volume. New-style sluice gates are being built in the sections from ×× to ××× to facilitate transportation. From Ziliujing to Dengguan, the water volume is relatively large, and three lock gates are being built. In the future, the transportation capacity can be increased and the transportation costs can also be reduced. (Telegraph from the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Sharp Drop in Rice Prices in Chengdu <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: In the past few days, frequent rainfall has completely changed the food situation in Free China. According to agricultural experts, if the rain continues for another week, this year's autumn harvest in Sichuan Province could reach 70% of normal. Rice prices in Chengdu have fallen by twenty yuan, and rice prices in Anhui Province have now fallen to twenty-five yuan per shi. According to news from foreigners in Chengdu, rice prices there recently rose from seventy yuan to ninety yuan per xin dou in one day, causing great panic among the people. Fortunately, the authorities immediately sold rice to the common people at a fixed price, and the people's minds were calmed. Currently, each xin dou has fallen to sixty-two yuan, which is six hundred and twenty yuan per shi. The Sichuan provincial authorities are currently adjusting and verifying land deeds in order to reassess land prices and replace land taxes with actual grain, starting on August 1st. In the past, large landlords in Sichuan Province relied on political power to mostly evade paying land taxes, or paid very little. Therefore, the provincial authorities plan to order these people to pay the full amount and warn wealthy gentry not to hoard rice, or they will be severely punished. According to news from foreigners, the current drop in rice prices in Chengdu is largely due to these large hoarders selling their hoarded rice at reduced prices on the market.

<h3 id="e14">A Broad Discussion on the Serious Relationship Between People's Livelihood and Commodity Prices <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is the only free and competitive international market in the Far East, and also a paradise of prosperity and leisure in the world. Moreover, with its special and convenient environment, even if there are great calamities or economic panics in any corner of the world, Shanghai is like a haven, avoiding the disaster of being caught in the crossfire, and enabling the citizens to continue their peaceful and happy lives. Two years ago, Shanghai, measured by the low prices of rice (only twelve yuan per shi), coal balls (only two yuan per dan) and general commodities, was a clear indication that this special international metropolis was able to stay out of trouble and was completely unaffected by any adverse effects.</p>
<p>However, since last year, the price of rice first jumped from a dozen yuan per shi to several tens of yuan. Then, it jumped again to one hundred and fifty yuan this spring. Other commodity prices then rose in unison. Anything that had rice as a cost factor was increased one after another; and social disputes emerged endlessly. Labor strikes to demand wage increases, capital increases wages and raises commodity prices again, circulating and shifting the burden, causing each other. It is truly unknown where it will end!</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have been stabilized by the restriction of Yang rice from the Public Works Department, but this can only be seen as a temporary phenomenon. Even if rice prices could be permanently maintained at the level of one hundred and sixteen yuan, it is definitely not something that the citizens can afford in the long run. Anyone with a slight understanding of the economic situation of various countries will certainly not dismiss this as nonsense. Let us briefly list a few points below to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Consider the consumption of rice or bread in households in various countries. They are all controlled by the government, accounting for between one-tenth and one-thirtieth of the average income. Those who earn a monthly salary of two hundred to four hundred yuan can still comfortably afford twenty yuan per month for bread or rice. On the other hand, the majority of people in our country today, if they earn one hundred yuan a month, are not enough to cover the cost of one shi of rice. The very few people with higher salaries must also feel the threat of rice consumption. The expenditure must account for between one-fifth and half of their income, and other expenses must be scraped together to make up for the shortfall. Some may say that this serious situation is all due to the commodity prices in Shanghai. That is indeed the case, but this further proves that commodity prices in Shanghai today are inappropriate and must be strictly corrected. Even in countries affected by the war, no region has food prices that exceed those in our country. In Hong Kong, which is close at hand, ordinary rice costs only twelve to fourteen Hong Kong dollars per shi, and one can imagine what percentage of Hong Kong citizens' income that accounts for. In Tokyo, Japan, the price of rice has recently been only about 43 Japanese yen per shi. The official price of flour in Japan is 5 yen 58 sen per bag, while in Shanghai it is about 33 yuan per bag. The price of coal in Japan has recently been 27 yen 70 sen per ton, while the price of coal in Shanghai today is about 400 yuan per ton. Looking further afield, the recent price of flour in London, England, is 25 shillings and 6 pence per 280 pounds. If calculated according to the recent exchange rate of three pence and a quarter, each pound costs only 33 cents in legal tender, while each pound of flour in Shanghai costs 70 cents in legal tender, which is more than twice as expensive. Moreover, the cost of living in both places must be calculated according to the currency of the respective countries to be an accurate comparison. The cost of one penny per pound of flour in London is no different from spending one cent in our country, and one cannot help but envy the lightness of the burden. The recent price of the best coal in London is about 32 shillings per ton, which is only about 120 yuan in legal tender, more than two times cheaper than the price of coal in Shanghai. If the expenditure and income of each country are compared as a percentage, the price of coal in Shanghai will exceed that in London by about 15 times. The recent price of the best beef in London, imported from the Far East and its colonies, is 5 shillings and 4 pence per 8 pounds, or 8 pence per pound, which is 2.5 yuan in legal tender, more than two times cheaper than the price of 4 yuan per pound in Shanghai. Considering the actual standard of living, the expenditure of 8 pence is equivalent to our spending 8 cents. In short, the prices of all daily necessities in London or other countries, whether calculated by converting them into legal tender or compared by the percentage of actual expenditure and income, are all several times lower than those in Shanghai.</p>
<p>To make it easier to grasp the real situation of living conditions in various countries, let us briefly discuss the cost of living index. The cost of living index in the world's warring and non-warring countries has generally changed very little, and there is no need to elaborate. In the past few years, the United Kingdom has increased by only about 1% each year, and only increased by 17% last year, with an index of 23. Japan has only increased by about 13% each year in recent years, and only increased by 16% last year, with an index of 139. However, our country has been increasing very rapidly year by year. In the last two years, it has doubled year by year, with an index of 615. If the index is compiled solely for food, the number of annual increases in various countries is even smaller, with a maximum of about 1%. However, our country is going against the trend, forming a peak of index 700. If the index is represented graphically, the indices of various countries are parallel lines or parallel lines with slight fluctuations. However, our country is a straight line with an angle of 60 degrees, which shows that the living standards of various countries in recent years are far less high than those in our country. Our country is based on agriculture, and there is no shortage of daily necessities. Since the outbreak of the European War, our country has also exported large quantities of agricultural products. Why have the prices of daily necessities skyrocketed to such an extent, exceeding the market prices of countries in the East and West? There is no other reason. It is undoubtedly due to the manipulation and monopoly of a large organization. Even with regard to the rice imported from various countries, if it were sold at the low price of rice at the place of origin, without hoarding and profiteering, today's rice price would be at most only 40 yuan per shi. Looking at the price of rice in Hong Kong and Japan, one can know that this statement is not false.</p>
<p>Looking again at the recent prices of public transportation, water and electricity fees, rickshaw rentals, and the salaries of civil servants, all are struggling to raise their prices and benefits. The reasons for the increase are the scarcity of sources and the increase in costs. For these types of requests, at this time of high prices, all citizens can understand their difficulties. However, the nature of public utilities and the people's livelihood, such as rice, are no different. Therefore, in various countries, proposals to increase prices must first be carefully reviewed by groups representing the people, and the public must be allowed to attend and participate in the discussion to determine the appropriateness of the increase. The success of public utilities depends only in part on the operators, and most of it must be attributed to the support of the community. Therefore, public utilities cannot reap high profits like other private enterprises. They must conform to the principle of taking from the people and using it for the people. If only the increase in costs is considered, and the request is hastily approved by the executive branch, the procedures are not appropriate and are greatly contrary to the principles of handling public utilities in various countries. Citizens cannot but regret this and hope that the relevant authorities will make reasonable corrections.</p>
<p>In summary, due to the continued rise in commodity prices, the livelihood of citizens has fallen into an extremely difficult situation. The reason for the rise in commodity prices is that the authorities have failed to provide timely control. Although the isolated island has a special international character, and the authorities have their own difficulties, the isolated island is still recognized by Chinese and foreigners as a paradise in the Far East. If they can not be divided, jointly plan the stability of the entire Shanghai, do not do things that go against the fundamentals, and do not make excessive profits, then commodity prices can gradually be brought into the right track, and the solution to the people's livelihood problem will be achieved!</p>

<p>Large Numbers of Aircraft Transported to the Dutch East Indies Authorities</p>
<p>Washington, June 22 (Aeronautical News): The United States is now actively transporting bombers and fighters to the Dutch East Indies to further deter Japan's ambition to advance south. The aircraft ordered from the United States in the past have been completed rapidly. By July of this year, the United States' monthly production can reach 2,000 aircraft. US aircraft continue to be transported across the Pacific to the Far East. Those shipped in April were valued at 57 million US dollars. Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Weelde recently arrived in New York after inspecting the Dutch East Indies, and are scheduled to transfer to Britain this week. They told reporters that, with US assistance, the colonies in the South Pacific are all on strict alert and have good equipment. Some commentators believe that Japan's failure to use force against the Dutch East Indies after the breakdown of commercial negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies is due to US aid to the Dutch East Indies. After the German battleship Bismarck was sunk, some people expressed that the situation in the South Pacific will inevitably change. The Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and the Philippines are 3,000 miles away from Japan and should be able to use long-range bombers to protect their own safety. Military figures in the Philippines are also actively advocating the establishment of a strong air force to assist the Dutch East Indies and Malaya in protecting interests vital to the survival of the United States.</p>

<p>Advising the Government to Accept a Compromise</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 14th - Government authorities requested the Senate and House to amend the conscription law, authorizing the government to retain soldiers whose service terms have expired, and to cancel the clauses prohibiting the dispatch of regular troops and National Guard to areas outside the Western Hemisphere. Following this, leaders of both the Senate and House will meet with President Roosevelt tomorrow to suggest that the government accept a compromise on this amendment. Otherwise, the Congressional discussion will inevitably be prolonged, and the government may not be able to fully implement its proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 14th - It is reported that Army Chief of Staff Marshall expressed his opinion to congressional leaders that if the current selective service is limited to one year without extension, then the United States' defense outposts will not have sufficient troops. Unless the term of service is extended, a large number of soldiers in Hawaii must be withdrawn because their twelve-month service term is about to expire.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - Japanese newspapers are currently discussing the tense relationship between Japan and Vietnam. Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" received a telegram from Hanoi pointing out that British and French colonies are maintaining close relations, regardless of the sharp state between London and Vichy. This fact should not be ignored by Japan. The newspaper claimed that Vietnam needs rubber and wheat from Australia, and kerosene from the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, it is shipping large quantities of cement to Malaya and Hong Kong to strengthen the defense works in those two places. In addition, Britain is trying its best to prevent Japan from obtaining rubber from Vietnam. Britain's attitude clearly shows its deep fear of the strength of Japan's military power in Vietnam, which will threaten Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, the United States and Britain are doing their utmost to prevent the expansion of Japan's influence in Vietnam.</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 14th - Officials revealed last night that the U.S. government has guaranteed that the German Consul General in San Francisco, Weitmann, and the German Consul General in New York, Bauers, will not be harassed when passing through the Pacific. The safe passage permits for the two German consuls and their families were obtained by the State Department at the request of Britain. Initially, the German consuls canceled their bookings on the Hachimanyama Maru because the United States stated that the safe passage permits issued by Britain were only valid on American ships. The U.S. transport ship "West Point" is scheduled to depart from New York on Tuesday, carrying other Axis consular personnel. Weitmann told United Press reporters that he had received orders from the German Embassy in Washington that he and Bauers should not leave the United States until July 31. He said that this order was issued after receiving guarantees from the British side that the owner of the Hachimanyama Maru refused to return to San Francisco to pick up the sixteen German consular personnel. Bauers will go to Shanghai to serve as Consul General.</p>

<p>The Anti-Aggression Front Becomes More Concrete</p>
<p>Poland Is Also Preparing to Conclude a Treaty with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - Moscow Radio broadcasted last night, "Fascism will soon feel the power constituted by the Soviet Union and Britain, and the joint action of the two great nations will end the vile crimes of the Hitler gang." This is the general attitude of Soviet workers after hearing about the Anglo-Soviet pact. Workers in various factories in the Soviet Union held meetings, discussions, and speeches. Upon hearing the announcement of the Anglo-Soviet pact, they were filled with enthusiasm. Stalin was also present at the signing of the Anglo-Soviet pact. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps, Lieutenant General MacFarlane, head of the British Military Mission to the Soviet Union, and key members of the mission and the British Embassy went to the office of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at around 5 pm on Saturday to meet with Stalin, Molotov, Vyshinsky (Deputy Foreign Minister), General Shaposhnikov (Deputy Defense Minister), and Sobolev (Executive Secretary of the Foreign Ministry) to sign the agreement. After the signing, they took photos and then drank champagne. The two sides had a very pleasant conversation. Stalin also spoke with MacFarlane and several other British people. The ceremony ended after an hour.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 14th - As a result of recent talks between Comrades Stalin and Molotov and the British Plenipotentiary Ambassador Cripps, the Soviet Union and Britain have concluded an agreement and appendices on joint action against Germany. Those present at the signing included, on the Soviet side, Comrade Stalin, Admiral Kuznetsov, Deputy Chairman of the People's Defense Committee Shaposhnikov, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Sobolev, and other responsible personnel. On the British side were personnel from the British Military Mission and Economic Mission, as well as personnel from the British Embassy. The contents of the agreement and appendices are as follows: The Soviet Government and the British Government conclude this agreement and declare as follows: (1) The two governments mutually guarantee to provide each other with assistance and various supplies in the current war against Hitler's Germany. (2) The two governments guarantee that during the current war, they will not negotiate or conclude any armistice agreement or peace treaty without mutual agreement. This agreement is in Russian and English, both of which have the same effect. The date is July 12, 1941, and the location is Moscow. The signatories, on the Soviet side, were Vice Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, and on the British side, Plenipotentiary Ambassador Cripps. As for the appendices, they were also signed on the same day by the two. After concluding the above agreement, the contracting parties agreed that the agreement would take effect immediately after signing without the need for ratification procedures.</p>
<p>Havas, Chongqing, 14th - After the signing of the Anglo-Soviet agreement on concerted action against Germany, it was unanimously and warmly welcomed here. Political figures believe that with the establishment of this agreement, American aid to the Soviet Union will inevitably become more active. China, Britain, and the United States have already been working together to resist aggression. Now that the Soviet Union and Britain have established an agreement, the united anti-aggression front of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has become more concrete. This is deeply in line with China's wishes.</p>

<p>United Press, London, 14th - Diplomatic and political figures recently stated that the Polish government in exile may conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union similar to the Anglo-Soviet agreement in the next few days. They also stated that in addition to stipulating increased cooperation in resisting Germany, this agreement also involves a matter that may become a serious issue after the war, namely, the abolition of Poland's current status. It is reported that Polish leaders here have recently begun negotiations with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky under British auspices, and the progress is quite rapid and satisfactory. This is because the Soviet Union has accepted this plan, and Poland is willing to take risks to deal with the current situation, and both have established diplomatic contact with the British and American governments.</p>
<p>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Declares That the International Situation Has Changed</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 14th - When receiving foreign journalists today, the Deputy Director of the Soviet Information Bureau and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky made the following remarks on the Soviet-British Joint Action Agreement: "This afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Soviet Union and Britain concluded an agreement on joint action against Germany. The agreement stipulates that the signatory countries shall not separately conclude peace treaties with Germany. The agreement is indeed a historic document and has fundamentally changed the international situation. Hitler has often said that he will unite and lead the European countries to fight against the Soviet Union. As expected, Hitler has completely failed. As far as organizing the so-called "European Alliance" is concerned, he has also failed to succeed. Some countries that have been forced to ally with Germany are, in fact, vassals of Germany. They have lost all their rights. On the other hand, the agreement concluded by the Soviet Union and Britain has proven that some strong countries have indeed formed a strong alliance to help each other in order to defeat Hitler's Germany. Those who participate in this alliance are Britain, which has obtained the assistance of the United States, the world's largest industrial country. From this point of view, Germany and its vassals have been resisted by an alliance of countries that truly love freedom. German politicians are not unaware of the danger of fighting on two fronts. At present, Germany is fighting on two fronts, which is the result of the mistakes of Hitler and his followers. Hitler's followers thought that even if Germany attacked the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would not unite with Britain. At present, Hitler's plan to defeat European countries one by one has obviously failed. From now on, Hitler and his followers will inevitably be attacked by enemies on two or more fronts. The Soviet-British agreement concluded on the 12th is not only an action to win freedom and independence for the Soviet Union, Britain, and the whole of Europe by armed force, but also gives Hitler's dream of dominating Europe and the world a crushing and most important blow." Then, a Japanese journalist asked about the impact of the Soviet-British agreement on Japan. He replied, "The Soviet-British agreement does not affect the treaties and promises of the two countries to third strong countries. In other words, the Soviet-Japanese relationship has not changed and is adjusted by the neutrality agreement signed on April 13, 1941."</p>
<p>British Newspaper Commentators Demand Sending Troops to Attack Germany</p>
<p>United Press, London, 14th - Officials pointed out that after the signing of the treaty between Britain and the Soviet Union, they will fight together to the end and will never make peace separately. However, both Britain and neutral parties recognize that the Soviet Union's military position at this time is extremely dangerous. The essence of the treaty depends on whether the Red Army can continue to absorb the fierce attack of the German army and continue to maintain a front to contain the German army. Where this front is located is not important at first, because what Hitler fears most is fighting on two fronts. He had promised his people that he would never reach this position. Therefore, where the Soviet front is located and whether it is fixed are not important, but there must be a front, and the Soviet Union's energy must be maintained without falling. Britain's front is currently limited to bombing German industrial centers to destroy its long-term war and blockade power. As for the scope of British-Soviet mutual assistance, except for military affairs, the rest is still vague and unclear. It now seems that Britain is providing operational intelligence and experience gained from Norway, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Balkans, etc., and methods of maintaining production under German air force bombing. Some people believe that the mutual assistance treaty may include the U.S. Lend-Lease Act, because President Roosevelt has not implemented the Neutrality Act for Vladivostok and other places, which would allow American ships to transport goods to that place. The Soviet Union urgently requested Britain to send troops to conquer Germany at the same time in order to achieve the effect of attacking on two fronts, or at least to make Hitler transfer several divisions to the western battlefield. However, this move is probably not possible for Britain at present. It is only known that the British army has been practicing crossing the sea for a long time to launch an attack. As for British newspaper commentators, they mostly demand sending troops to conquer Germany as the only way to defeat Hitler.</p>
<p>Havas, Turkish Capital, 14th - Responsible sources here said that because Turkey is its ally, Britain has notified the Turkish authorities of the situation of the Anglo-Soviet talks at any time since Britain established a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The United States Recognizes the Anglo-Soviet Signing as a Reasonable Development</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th - Most senators believe that the Anglo-Soviet pact will not affect the United States' attitude towards the war. The State Department refused to comment on the treaty and the Soviet official's statement that the treaty actually made the United States a companion in the Soviet Union's war against Germany. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman George said that the treaty was a natural result of fighting a common enemy. House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bloom said, "The treaty has absolutely nothing to do with the United States." A key member of the isolationist faction, Republican Senator Nye, said, "This kind of development was expected, but we have not forgotten that there was also this kind of pact between Britain and France before. We hope this treaty will not have the same result." Other senators said that the treaty was very appropriate and that Americans welcomed the close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th - German responsible bookstores claimed last night that Berlin was not surprised by the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance agreement aimed at defeating National Socialist Germany, because this agreement has no major impact on the development of the war. If two people who are about to fall embrace each other at the last moment, it will not prevent them from falling. The main point of the agreement is that the British financial tycoons and communism openly resist the trend in Europe. However, the agreement cannot change the path that has already been taken. The ultimate goal is the destruction of financial tycoons and communism.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Fierce Fighting Continues in Three Regions of Soviet Territory; Red Army Recaptures Two Towns on the Western Front <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Moscow Announces Results of Three Weeks of War</p>
<p>German Casualties and Captures Reach One Million</p>
<p>Losses Include Three Thousand Tanks and Two Thousand Aircraft</p>
<p>Moscow, 13th (Havas) – The Red Army General Headquarters issued a war report tonight, not confirming German claims of breaking through the Stalin Line. It only stated that major battles are taking place in the areas of Pskov, Vitebsk, and Nevel, with fierce fighting still ongoing. The frontline situation is as follows: (1) On the Northwest front, the Red Army engaged in fierce fighting against enemy motorized and armored units throughout the day, eventually repelling the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties. (2) On the Western front, the Red Army recaptured the towns of Zhlobin and Rogachev. The enemy launched fierce attacks with large numbers of infantry, and the battle is still raging. (3) On the Southwest front, enemy armored and motorized units attempted to break through the Red Army's positions, but were all blocked and failed. Our artillery, tanks, and air force cooperated effectively, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. (4) There were no major battles on other fronts, and both sides held their original positions. (5) The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy armored and motorized units and airfields throughout the day, destroying a total of 131 German aircraft.</p>
<p>Moscow, 14th (TASS) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its war report of the 13th that there were no significant battles on the front line during the past night. In the afternoon of the 12th, our forces in the southwest annihilated an enemy motorized regiment. In the evening, our air force heavily bombed enemy mechanized units, airfields, military targets, and the areas of Zhlobin and Pruzhany.</p>
<p>Moscow, 14th (TASS) – Fascist propaganda organs are spreading news of Soviet army losses, attempting to deceive the German public and other countries with these rumors. We will summarize the results of three weeks of war to clarify this issue. The Red Army's fight against the Fascist forces for three weeks has proven that Hitler's blitzkrieg strategy has failed. During this period, German casualties and captures amounted to at least one million, while our casualties and losses totaled less than 250,000. The Soviet Air Force has inflicted significant losses on the enemy. According to accurate statistics, in the initial period, a total of 2,300 German aircraft were destroyed, and continuous heavy damage was inflicted on enemy aircraft, mechanized units, motorized units, and airfields. It is confirmed that German aircraft are avoiding engagement with Soviet fighter planes. German forces have lost 3,000 tanks. During the same period, our side lost 1,900 aircraft and 2,200 tanks. The fact that Germany has ordered the recall of a large part of its troops from occupied France and the complete withdrawal of German troops from the German-Swiss border, replacing them with veterans and disabled soldiers, is sufficient proof that Germany has indeed suffered heavy losses in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Germany Claims Eastern Front Situation Rapidly Changing; Will Launch Full-Scale Offensive on Moscow</p>
<p>New York, 14th (Havas) – According to a report from the Turkish capital by the American Wireless Radio Station, German vanguard units are no more than 200 kilometers from Moscow, according to Turkish sources.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 13th (Havas) – According to reliable sources, German forces have broken through the Stalin Line at seven key strategic points. German sources claim that after German forces occupied the Soviet city of Vitebsk (northeast of Minsk), they penetrated 60 miles into the Stalin Line in that area. From there, they will be able to advance directly and launch an offensive on Moscow, as there are no significant defensive works between the two locations. The German forces' decision to fight in this manner is also based on an encirclement strategy. The main objective of the German forces in the future is to completely annihilate the Red Army.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) – Berlin Wireless Radio broadcast last night that the breakthrough of the Stalin Line is comparable to the breakthrough of the Weygand Line, which led to the collapse of France. It claimed that once the Weygand Line was broken, French resistance was completely crushed, and its collapse was inevitable. Should history not repeat itself in the Eastern European war? The public does not fully understand the significance of the German victory over the Soviet Union, so it should be compared to the war against France last year. The Stalin Line is said to be 32 miles deep in some locations. German forces have broken through this line, achieving a turning point in the war and securing victory in the fight against Bolshevism.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong) – This office received a report last night that German tank units, after breaking through the Stalin Line, have penetrated 25 kilometers into the interior, completely surprising Soviet tank divisions. A total of 165 Soviet tanks were destroyed or captured. In several places, German forces have penetrated 100 kilometers into the Stalin Line. The line is up to 50 kilometers deep in some sections, but German forces still managed to break through it. According to authorities, the situation on the Eastern Front has now taken a sharp turn, and the fourth stage, the decisive stage, has now begun. The breakthrough of the Stalin Line also marks the start of the war of annihilation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong) – Responsible authorities emphasized last night that the capture of Kiev is imminent, and Leningrad is also threatened by advancing German tank units. It was also claimed that the result of the German-Soviet air battle on the 12th was the destruction of 147 Soviet aircraft, of which 88 were shot down in the air and 59 were destroyed on the ground. German aircraft lost a total of nine. When the German Air Force assisted the army in attacking, it destroyed 77 tanks, 400 motorized vehicles, several transport trains, and 34 artillery pieces. German aircraft suffered no losses, it was said.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) – While news of German victories on the Eastern Front cannot be confirmed here, it is believed that the Germans may have made some progress. The most dangerous Nazi threat seems to be the offensive against Leningrad. However, it is reported that Soviet forces are currently adjusting their lines in Bessarabia. According to last night's Moscow communique, which contradicts German claims of a major victory, there has been little change in the positions of the two armies on the front line.</p>
<p>German Leader's Headquarters, 14th (Haitong) – German battlefield reports this afternoon stated that German forces' operations on the Eastern Front are progressing according to plan. Finnish forces have begun a two-pronged attack towards Lake Ladoga. German destroyers sank two Soviet patrol boats.</p>

<p>New York, 13th (Havas) – According to reports from the Turkish capital by local wireless radio, the British military mission in the Soviet Union has moved from Moscow to Gorky City to the east (formerly Nizhny Novgorod, several hundred miles from Moscow). The Soviet government is also preparing to move to that location.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Havas) – Local radio stations recently broadcast a report from the Turkish capital stating that the Soviet government has notified foreign diplomats of its intention to move the capital in the near future, requesting that foreign missions also prepare to move. Personnel from the American embassy in the Soviet Union left Moscow last night, and British diplomatic personnel have also departed. It is also learned that British-Soviet negotiations on warfare tactics will continue in Gorky City.</p>

<p>Warns British People to Defend Against Further Enemy Attacks</p>
<p>And Inspects Civilian Defense Personnel</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) – After inspecting 6,000 civilian defense workers in Hyde Park this morning, Prime Minister Churchill attended a luncheon at the London City Council and delivered a speech. He expressed admiration for the tireless and heroic efforts of British civilian defense workers, stating that the intensity of our current bombing of the enemy has exceeded any period of enemy bombing of Britain. However, this is only the beginning, and we will continue to expand the range and overthrow this terrible tyranny. The spirit of courage displayed by London residents during the bombing not only allowed Britain to weather the crisis but also made a deep impression on other countries and won tens of millions of friends in the United States. I dare say that the massive increase in American aid to Britain is largely due to the spirit of the residents of London and other places enduring enemy bombing. You have just gone through a long and difficult war, or may at any time transition into another war. Although there is a lull at the moment, we must prepare for the enemy to continue attacking us soon.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Discord Between Hitler and Goering <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) – Moscow Radio broadcast last night news of a major disagreement between Hitler and Goering before the attack on the Soviet Union. The radio reporter stated that reliable Swedish sources reported that Goering, citing the repeated losses of the German Air Force in Western Europe, the Balkans, and Crete, argued that it was not appropriate to engage in a new war and refused to take responsibility for attacking the Soviet Union. Hitler denounced him as a coward and declared that he would personally command the Air Force. The fact that German newspapers have not mentioned Goering's name suggests that the above news is credible. It is also rumored that secret police chief Himmler has advocated placing Goering in a detention center.</p>

<p>British and Australian Troops to Enter Beirut Immediately; Armistice Agreement to Be Approved Soon</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) – A Reuters correspondent with the Allied forces, reporting from outside Beirut, stated that the sound of artillery and machine guns in Syria has finally ceased and turned into a peaceful silence. However, Allied forces remain on alert, and artillery has not yet left its positions. It is widely speculated that a ceasefire agreement may be signed within 24 hours, and the result of the ceasefire will be that Allied forces take over Syria in both political and military terms. After the ceasefire terms were initially signed on Saturday night, representatives of both governments immediately telegraphed these terms to their respective governments for instructions and are now awaiting a final decision. Last night, the lights of Beirut were brightly illuminated, shining directly on the sea. Many Palestinian merchants with branches in Syria are now preparing for the immediate resumption of commercial relations, as the situation in Syria is about to return to normal. The mountain peaks of Lebanon have many trees and are a popular summer resort. Every year, thousands of people come here from Egypt, Iraq, and Palestine to spend the summer. It is expected that the prosperity will not decrease after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Aleppo, 14th (Haitong) – British and Australian troops will enter Beirut tomorrow, at which time French forces will withdraw from the city. This is information revealed by sources close to the French High Commissioner. It is also learned that the Syrian armistice agreement will be approved on the 16th by the French authorities in Beirut and the British authorities in Cairo. Captain Littleton will represent the British government in Egypt to carry out this task.</p>
<p>Vichy, 14th (Havas) – Regarding the Syrian war, British and French representatives are scheduled to initial the armistice agreement today in the city of Saint Jean d'Acre in Palestine.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Bulgaria in Partial Mobilization <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Sympathetic to Soviet Officers</p>
<p>Have Been Detained in Concentration Camps</p>
<p>Ankara, 14th (Reuters) – It is reported that Bulgaria has completed its partial mobilization. Travelers arriving here from Bulgaria stated that they did not see a heavy concentration of troops on the border, but they did see many large-scale camps along the Plovdiv to Svilengrad area, so that troops could be deployed to all parts of the country when needed. From the current situation, the Bulgarian government is extremely alarmed because the people have pro-Soviet sentiments. It is permitted that the Communist Party is quite active in the ports of Varna and Burgas. Many officers sympathetic to the Soviet Union have now been detained in concentration camps. German road signs can still be seen everywhere. Bulgaria's internal situation may explain its partial mobilization, because if Bulgaria fights against the Soviet Union, the country will split in two, and it would be tantamount to suicide to try to seize Thrace from Turkey.</p>
<p>Sofia, 14th (Haitong) – The Bulgarian Parliament has approved a special budget of 439.830 leva (Bulgarian currency), of which 300 million leva are intended for the use of the Ministry of War.</p>

<p>London, 14th (Reuters) – On Saturday night, an invasion drill was held in the industrial city of Birmingham in the Midlands. First, "enemy" planes carried out air raids, and then thousands of paratroopers under the command of "General Stirling," many of whom were Czech, Free French, and Dutch soldiers, descended. Although it was not difficult to occupy several outposts, the number of paratroopers gradually decreased after engaging the Home Guard, which was solely defending the city, and they were ultimately defeated and failed to achieve their common goals in any way.</p>

<p>The Luces Return to New York After Trip to China</p>
<p>Participate in Grand Event and Deliver Incisive Speeches</p>
<p>Victory in the Pacific to Be Entrusted to China</p>
<p>New York Cable – The National United China Relief held a "Salute to China's Leaders" banquet at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on the evening of June 18th at 7:30 pm. 1,600 to 1,700 prominent figures from all walks of life in the United States attended the banquet. The US and Chinese flags were hung high around the venue, and the pillars were surrounded by Chinese couplets, creating a magnificent and beautiful scene. It was truly a grand event.</p>
<p>Chinese Leaders Highly Praised</p>
<p>After several rounds of drinks, Chairman Willkie rose to deliver the opening remarks, praising the achievements of Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek and his wife in resisting and building the nation. After introducing the distinguished guests on the honorary dais, such as former New York Governor Smith and the third generation of the oil magnate, he elaborated on the observations and significance of the trip to China by Luce, the owner of the three magazines "Life", "Time", and "Fortune", and his wife, the famous writer Clare Boothe Luce, from the Chinese rear area. He then invited Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce to speak and broadcast the speech across the United States.</p>
<p>Hu Shih and Johnson Follow Up with Speeches</p>
<p>Mrs. Luce is a young, beautiful, and famous writer. When she stepped onto the stage to speak, the ladies and gentlemen in the audience were pleasantly surprised as if they had met a celestial being. Mrs. Luce then pleaded for our wounded and brave soldiers from a humanitarian perspective and pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of American aid to China from a political, economic, and strategic perspective with a gentle and melodious voice. Subsequently, the chairman introduced the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, to speak. The entire audience stood up to pay their respects. Dr. Hu praised the spirit of Mr. and Mrs. Luce's trip to China from a Chinese standpoint. Then, former American Ambassador to China Johnson was invited to speak, and he also made a lot of remarks.</p>
<p>The Arduous Task of the Far East Entrusted to China</p>
<p>Chairman Willkie then introduced Mr. Luce to speak. One of the aphorisms in Mr. Luce's speech was that the Neutrality Act passed by the United States a few years ago was purely an ostrich policy... The United States is now threatened by both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If we want to win without fighting, I don't know what kind of secret plan can achieve this goal!... I really don't know! ... From now on, we will not hesitate to help democratic countries even to the point of participating in the war. Once the war breaks out, the United States must devote all its efforts to winning victory in the Atlantic, while victory in the Pacific will be entrusted to the army of the Great Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Entire Audience Stands to Pay Respects to China</p>
<p>At this point, Luce asked all the guests to stand and remain silent for about a minute to show their respect. After this, Chairman Willkie read out a congratulatory telegram from the Governor of New York, Lehman, and then invited Mr. Albright, a consultant to the US State Department, to speak. Mr. Albright reiterated the main points of President Roosevelt's speech on helping China and the Secretary of State Hull's advocacy of aid to China, etc. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 11:30 pm before departing.</p>

<p>No Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>Telephone workers gathered at the entrances of various companies yesterday morning, intending to strike to demand higher wages and the release of three arrested individuals. At that time, the situation was quite serious. Later, they were all instructed by detectives to enter the company and resume work, and more than ten telephone workers were arrested, including Mai Tehesi Tuolu Wang Jisheng, Jiangxi Road Xiao Ruqi, one person from Fujian Road, four people from Haining Road, and three people from the Shanghai West area. As of the time of this reporter's dispatch, there was no news of their release. It is reported that the Public Works Department's Political Department, in order to maintain order within the Concession, is working to conduct impartial mediation. It is heard that they had a meeting with the company once yesterday, and the company has expressed its acceptance of the authorities' mediation, while the workers have also expressed their welcome to the authorities' mediation. This labor unrest is not expected to escalate. It is heard that the authorities had a preliminary mediation yesterday, but the results have not been announced to the public.</p>
<p>Instigators Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that a labor dispute has been ongoing at the factory of the American-owned China Electric Company for a week. This morning (the 14th), one of the striking employees of the factory attempted to incite telephone workers to respond to the strike and was detained by police officers of the Public Concession for questioning.

<p>Fuxin Female Workers Petition</p>
<p>About 100 female workers from the Fuxin Tobacco Company gathered around the Public Works Department Building today, expressing their opposition to the treatment they received. They were dispersed by Central Police Station officers, and no accidents occurred. It is noted that the workers of the cigarette factory demanded a wage increase and were refused, and they have been on strike for about three weeks. It is heard that these female workers earn only seventy cents a day, which is not enough to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Rumors of Yesterday's Takeover Were Not True</p>
<p>It was previously rumored that Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 2 and No. 9 might be taken over, causing surprise in society. According to yesterday's news, the rumor of the takeover is not reliable. It is noted that the No. 9 Factory on Macau Road is operated by the British-owned Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the No. 2 Factory on Yichang Road is operated by the American-owned American Enterprises Company.</p>
<p>Factory Statements</p>
<p>Both factories have issued statements, stating that they are operated by British and American companies and are operating as usual. At the same time, they have reported to the British and American consulates in Shanghai and requested protection. It is heard that the two factories are located in the US military defense zone, and the British and American consulates have consulted with US military commander in Shanghai, Colonel Howard, to dispatch troops to the factory for protection when necessary. Since yesterday, two Chinese detectives from the Putuo Road Police Station have been stationed at the No. 2 and No. 9 factories.</p>
<p>Production Situation</p>
<p>Shenxin Textile Factory is one of the largest-scale yarn factories in Shanghai, especially the No. 9 Yarn Factory, which is the largest. Its 20-count Double Horse Yarn is the standard yarn in the current cotton yarn market, serving as the standard price for trading. The two factories can produce more than 20,000 bales of cotton yarn per month. However, since March, due to power restrictions, they have been reducing labor like other yarn factories. Currently, they produce more than 10,000 bales of yarn per month. Since the news of the takeover was spread, the morale of the cotton yarn market was affected yesterday morning, and people were selling off their holdings, but it quickly recovered, and the closing price was similar to last Saturday.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Milk Shortage, Rational Allocation <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Before February, there was a phenomenon of oversupply of milk in Shanghai, so that milk companies had to sell at reduced prices. However, recently, due to the hot weather and the unstable international situation, milk companies have refused to accept new customers and are considering taking "reasonable" allocation measures for old customers. It is heard that the Cody Milk Company does not intend to reduce its supply to small users, but requests for increases are difficult to approve. Recently, Milk Company has not only refused to accept new users, but also plans to reduce supply to old users. Shanghai Milk Company will reduce the supply to hotels and restaurants, etc. in the future. Milk merchants are discussing remedial measures and plan to import cattle from Australia and the Americas. It is difficult to predict whether it will be realized. It is believed that the milk shortage problem will be solved when the autumn is high and the air is clear in September and October.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Yesterday's French National Day Passed in Solemnity <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Wreath-Laying at the French Cemetery Memorial</p>
<p>Flag-Raising Ceremony Held at the French Consulate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the French community in Shanghai, in accordance with the will of Marshal Pétain, celebrated French National Day with a solemn attitude. At 8:45 AM, the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, accompanied by the French Consul General, Magère, and other French officials, laid wreaths at the memorial in the Baixianqiao Cemetery.</p>
<p>A guard of French soldiers and scouts stood at attention in front of the monument to pay their respects. At 9:30 AM, the Ambassador presided over the flag-raising ceremony at the French Consulate. Subsequently, Magère hosted the French community. It is noted that in previous years, on French National Day, the French army and police in the French Concession would hold grand exercises in Gujiazhai Park, with children's competitions. At night, the Bund and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession were adorned with tricolor electric lights, creating a picturesque scene, and the park was filled with visitors watching the fireworks. This year, due to the drastic changes in France's national situation, everything was simplified.</p>
<p>Some French citizens took advantage of this memorial day to send telegrams to General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, expressing their determination to inherit the legacy of the martyrs, be loyal to their country, and continue to fight for freedom, liberation, and ultimate victory.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Shen Bao's Reader Scholarship Fund Arouses Widespread Sympathy <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Readers Donate Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Regulations Being Drafted and Progressing Actively</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund campaign, yesterday was the third day, and we have received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, exceeding expectations. Our colleagues at the newspaper have been drafting regulations and application forms in recent days, and they are largely complete. The work of each group has also been assigned, hoping to coordinate with the enthusiasm of all sectors to accelerate the progress of benefiting underprivileged students. We believe that this is something that the community will be happy to hear. We will report the receipts of yesterday and other matters to the readers as follows:</p>
<p>All Sectors Compete to Donate</p>
<p>Reader Scholarship Fund: Mr. Nong, 200 yuan; Mr. Yu Yongcheng, 20 yuan; Mr. Hu Chunyuan, 10 yuan; Jinxiu Amateur Circulation Library, 3 yuan and 2 jiao; Mr. Qian Qi, 20 yuan; Ms. Zheng Tang Huijuan, 10 yuan; 59 female students, a joint donation of 100 yuan; Wen Ji, 5 yuan; Jun Ji, 5 yuan; Mr. Ge Fulin, 10 yuan. Yesterday's total receipts were 383 yuan and 2 jiao. In addition, Mr. Xiong Wenhua, who runs a used bookstore at the entrance of the Kader Road Nanyang Soap Factory, is willing to donate all the books needed by the three disaster-stricken children, Ni Zhaoqi, Bao Jiazeng, and Wu Gengsheng, when they study at Lida Academy in the future. His enthusiasm is commendable. Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, Room 205, wrote to say that he is willing to save 20 yuan each month to provide meals for one of the three children until his job is terminated. Mr. Shen's long-term donation of his labor income is certainly praiseworthy. In addition to donating money, Ge Fulin also wrote a letter hoping that the three disaster-stricken children will learn morality and strive for excellence, and take on a great mission for the country and the nation in the future. The sincerity is revealed between the lines, which is worthy of admiration. However, this newspaper believes that phased donations or assistance with other items are more cumbersome in handling procedures. It is best to donate once and for all or convert it into cash. We hope that people from all walks of life will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Engaging Renowned Figures to Oversee Everything</p>
<p>This newspaper plans to engage four leaders in the education sector and one representative from this newspaper to form a committee to oversee the scholarship fund. Seven groups will be established: administrative, registration, investigation, review, publicity, accounting, and economic groups. It has been decided to cultivate the three disaster-stricken children, Ni, Bao, and Wu, until they graduate from junior high school. After that, the policy will be determined based on the situation. It is estimated that for the three years of junior high school, each student will be subsidized with 400 yuan per year for meals and miscellaneous expenses, totaling 1,200 yuan per student. For the three students, a total of 3,600 yuan is needed. Currently, in addition to Mr. Wang Juerong subsidizing Ni with 300 yuan per semester, totaling 600 yuan for three years, an additional 3,000 yuan is needed. In addition to cultivating these three students, this newspaper will distribute the remaining donations to other qualified underprivileged students, so that the readers' donations will be used practically. The scope is not intended to be extensive at first, but the organization will be as meticulous as possible, so as not to fail the readers' intention to cultivate talents. We hope that you will provide supervision and cooperation at any time regarding future directions.</p>

<p>The British-owned Yilong Company's Shenai ship, with a gross tonnage of 2,410 tons and a net tonnage of 1,451 tons, carrying 3,000 tons (approximately 30,000 bags) of small-grain rice from Yangon for the French Dafu Foreign Firm, was sailing from Yangon to Tianjin when it ran aground due to a hurricane off Chengshanjiao, Shandong. The shipowner urgently telegraphed the Yilong head office in Shanghai to report the incident and seek assistance. The Shanghai head office immediately reported the incident to the American-Asia Insurance Company, which insured the ship's safety. After consultation between Yilong Company and the American-Asia Company, it was decided to send a ship to rescue the vessel. Telegrams were immediately sent to the Weihaiwei and Tianjin agents to dispatch tugboats for rescue. It is reported that although the Shenai has run aground, it is not in immediate danger. However, Chengshanjiao is known for its dangerous reefs and is considered a fearsome place by navigators. Therefore, if there are no major storms, it may be possible to escape danger, but at least some of the rice will have been water damaged.</p>

<p>According to reliable sources, due to the recent surge in activity by Chinese military guerrillas along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, who are dismantling tracks and laying landmines everywhere, incidents of train bombings have been occurring frequently, making it virtually impossible to defend against them. Therefore, in recent days, a large number of iron wire mesh frames, approximately three feet high, have been erected on both sides of the railway from Kunshan westward to Nanjing. Electricity is passed through them at night to prevent sabotage. However, if ignorant villagers accidentally touch the wires, the harm would be unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Public Transportation Ridership Drops Sharply After Fare Increase <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Said to be a Necessary Phenomenon After Price Increases</p>
<p>But the Size of This Price Hike Makes a Return to Original Ridership Unlikely</p>
<p>Following the simultaneous fare increase yesterday by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company and the Shanghai Electric Construction Company in the Public Concession, citizens from all walks of life, struggling to make ends meet under severe pressure from the high cost of living, actively opposed the increase beforehand. However, as the fare increase had already been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, the company authorities refused to change their stance and resolutely implemented it.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Ridership</p>
<p>All sectors feel that the fare increase by the two companies, amounting to more than 50%, is a heavy burden. As a result, many people are choosing to walk instead of taking vehicles, leading to a sharp decline in ridership on all vehicles after the price increase. Compared to before the price increase, ridership has decreased by approximately 40-50%. However, due to the increased fare, the revenue has not decreased slightly despite the sharp decline in ridership, remaining similar to the period before the rice price increases. According to ticket sellers, the decline in ridership after a price increase is a necessary phenomenon each time. After a maximum of half a month, the original number of passengers should be restored, and the ticket revenue should increase by 60-70%. However, it is feared that this drastic price increase will make it difficult to restore the original crowded conditions. According to another source, the bus company can earn an additional 20,000 yuan per day after yesterday's price increase, and 600,000 yuan per month, of which 500,000 yuan can be profit. The trolley company's daily revenue can also increase by 10-20,000 yuan. Therefore, after yesterday, the two companies can earn an additional 40,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>French Tramways to Follow Suit</p>
<p>Furthermore, the French Tramways and Bus Company, a subsidiary of the French Water and Electricity Company, has also submitted a request to the Board of Directors of the French Concession for approval to increase fares, as the British vehicles have already increased their prices. It is reported that the Board of Directors will discuss this at the next meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Fascinated by Detective Novels, Emulating Arsène Lupin <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Two Students Break Into Neighbor's House and Succeed</p>
<p>Arrested for Withdrawing Money from Bank, Confess to Motives</p>
<p>Novels and dramas, although capable of guiding people towards good, can sometimes mislead people and cause them to violate the law. For example, in the sensational case of the Zhou brothers murdering their father, according to the defendants' confessions, they claimed to have been fascinated by the study of electricity, leading them to commit this heinous crime. Furthermore, there are countless cases of young people being obsessed with supernatural novels, abandoning their families, and going to the deep mountains to seek enlightenment. Now, there are two young students who, because they usually like to read detective novels, actually used the various techniques in the novels to commit acts of theft. The details of the incident are worth recounting:</p>
<p>Studying Detective Stories to Test Skills</p>
<p>A native of Fujian, Wang Shiwei, 17 years old, lives at No. 22, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. He is currently studying at a certain church university. His father works in the political arena and is wealthy. Wang is fond of reading detective novels, which has led to his fascination. Song Songde (also 17 years old), a local resident living at No. 331, Wuzhou Road, studying at the Hua Tong Public School, used to be a classmate of Wang's and also a detective enthusiast. The two were both friends and like-minded, so they discussed putting their skills to the test. Zhang Ying (nicknamed "Scarface Sixth"), a socialite who had married a Korean, Mr. Huang, lived across from Wang's house at No. 34. The two targeted Zhang Ying.</p>
<p>Emulating Arsène Lupin</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, Wang and Song discussed the method of proceeding at the Guanglu Grand Theater on Museum Road, emulating the gentleman thief Arsène Lupin to commit robbery and then donate the stolen funds to charitable organizations. After careful deliberation and research, on the morning of the 12th of this month, they gathered at the entrance of the Ping'an Grand Theater on Seymour Road, carrying a fake pistol, a bayonet, several ropes, and several bandages. In order to prevent the victim from recognizing their true identities, in addition to wearing glasses, Wang Shiwei also wore a mouth cover. To avoid leaving fingerprints, both of them wore rubber finger cots. To divert the attention of the police, Wang also hid a bottle of brandy.</p>
<p>Breaking into Residence and Stealing Valuables</p>
<p>After the preparations were complete, they went together to No. 34 Jing'an Villa. Under the pretense of delivering newspapers, they tricked the maid into opening the back door. They then taped the maid's eyes with bandages, stuffed a handkerchief into her mouth, and tied her hands and feet with ropes. They proceeded to the residence of Yu Wenrong on the second floor. Using the same method, they tied up Yu and his wife, stealing more than 400 yuan in legal currency, more than 100 yuan in Japanese currency, and a pocket watch. They then went to the bedroom of Huang Zhangying on the third floor, tying her up as well. They calmly searched and stole her deposit book with 9,585.60 yuan at the Siming Bank on Jing'an Temple Road, a deposit book with 6,000 yuan at the Yongfengyu Gold Shop on Nanjing Road, as well as jewelry and legal currency, worth a total of 17,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Drinking and Relaxing Before Leaving</p>
<p>During that time, the two drank, smoked, and listened to the radio in the room for more than two hours before leaving with the stolen goods. After the Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified, they immediately ordered detectives Jiang Shangpei, Zhu Jiheng, and Ni Jiafeng, along with detective Xian Chengming, to rush to the scene to investigate. Because Wang and Song's plan was meticulous, unprecedented in previous theft cases, they were unable to obtain any clues for a while. Since there were two deposit books among the stolen items, they waited at the bank. On the 13th, Wang indeed brought the deposit book to the Siming Bank to withdraw money and was apprehended. They then went to his house and found the fake pistol, bayonet, and all the stolen goods. At this time, Song suddenly arrived and was arrested along with him.</p>
<p>Confessing Frankly After Being Arrested for Withdrawing Money</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the details, stating that the purpose of the defendants leaving the wine bottle at the victim's house was to make the detectives mistakenly believe that the perpetrator was a drunkard and not pay attention to them. When questioned, both defendants confessed frankly, claiming that their families were wealthy and not in financial need. They stated that the robbery was actually due to their fascination with detective novels, and they intended to donate the stolen funds to the Children's Education Institute. The defendants' lawyers, Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan, requested the court to order the detectives to search the defendants' homes for detective novels. According to Wang Shiwei, he has more than 40 detective novels in his possession. After Judge Shi Meiyu interrogated the two victims, he ordered Wang and Song to be detained for further questioning at a later date and instructed the police to search the homes of the two defendants for a large number of detective novels.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Abnormal Weather, Like Autumn <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>

The amount of rainfall is rare. Due to the unfavorable weather, diseases are rampant. According to the Public Health Department of the Public Concession's Public Works Department, typhoid fever had the highest number of cases and deaths last week, with 98 cases and 88 deaths. There were 44 cases of bacillary dysentery with 24 deaths, and 89 cases of tuberculosis with 77 deaths. In addition, athlete's foot, influenza, malaria, measles, and typhus are also rampant. There was only one case of cholera. Citizens must pay close attention to their health.</p>

<p>Five Bullets Hit, Killed on the Spot, Stray Bullet Wounds a Stall Partner</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, at the south side of the Xinzhapu Bridge on Xinzhapu Road, detective Zhou Kejin of the Xinzhapu Police Station was shot and killed. He was hit by five bullets on the spot and fell to the ground. A stray bullet wounded a passerby. The perpetrators escaped without a trace. Details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Gunfire Assassination</p>
<p>Zhou Kejin, a detective at the Xinzhapu Police Station, nicknamed "Little Jiangbei," was 34 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at No. 7, Jin Yi Lane, Xinzhapu Road. At around 11:05 AM yesterday, Zhou was wearing a black short shirt and blue cloth pants, carrying a paper fan. He had just left home with a friend surnamed Wang and was at the south side of the Xinzhapu Bridge, in front of a certain hemp bag shop at No. 41 Malu, when two men in short clothes, who had been lying in wait on the side of the road, suddenly opened fire on Zhou. More than ten shots were fired.</p>
<p>Bullets Hit Vital Parts</p>
<p>Zhou was unable to dodge and was hit by five bullets: one in the right chest and one in the left waist, one in the left arm, and two in the left leg. The bullets in the chest and waist did not penetrate. A stray bullet hit the left abdomen and grazed the left forehead of Zuo Zhaofa (41 years old, from Zhenjiang, resident of Zhabei Guangfu Road), a vendor at a pancake stall at No. 51 Lane on the same road. He bled profusely.</p>
<p>Died from Serious Wounds</p>
<p>After the incident, the perpetrators fled without a trace. The Xinzhapu Police Station rushed to the scene and immediately summoned ambulances to send the two injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment while strictly searching for the perpetrators. Zhou's life was in danger due to the wounds in his chest and waist.</p>

Fearing that death would be slow in coming, she also used a sharp blade to cut her throat, severing her trachea and collapsing on the bed, expiring. It was not until 5:00 AM that Yu Huisheng, a tea room employee, discovered the scene, finding the room full of blood and Qian dead on the bed.</p>

<p>Tuesdays Designated as Closing Day</p>
<p>Since the official opening of the Shanghai Children's Library, the average number of visitors has been over 600 per day. The interior is extremely crowded. As a temporary measure, children are allowed to read outdoors in the open space outside the library, even using paper instead of mats and sitting outside the doors of neighboring houses, to satisfy the hunger for spiritual nourishment of these young readers. At the same time, in order to reduce the number of visitors to the library, procedures for lending books and negotiating the establishment of circulation stations are being expedited, so as to alleviate the current difficulty of accommodating so many people. According to Director Lin, as told to a Guanghua News Agency reporter yesterday, application forms have already been numbered and will be issued starting tomorrow (Wednesday). It is best for parents to accompany young children who need to obtain these application forms to complete the procedures at the library, which is more convenient. It has also been decided that Tuesdays will be closing days (Sundays are still open as usual), so it will be closed today for internal reorganization in order to be neat and tidy for tomorrow's opening.</p>

<p>Four Bandits Carried Xu Away in a Rickshaw</p>
<p>Xu Wenbin, a 51-year-old man from Haimen who is in the peppermint oil business, lives at 7, Lane 600, Haige Road, West Shanghai (near Yidingpan Road). Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., four bandits suddenly appeared. One guarded the front door, and three carried a net basket and a container, deceptively opening the door by claiming that these items were brought from the countryside for Mr. Xu. At that time, Xu's servant believed them and let them in. They went straight to Xu's bedroom on the second floor. Xu had already gotten up. The three bandits entered the room, threatened him with guns, and tied him up. After walking out the back door, they forced Xu onto a rickshaw parked at the street corner. Another bandit also took another rickshaw, monitoring them from behind with a gun. They went south all the way. When Xu was kidnapped, his son, Xijue, saw it from upstairs, so he went downstairs to try to call for help, but he didn't dare to speak because the bandit at the rear was holding a handgun. He only reported it to the police afterward, but there was no news of him as of the evening.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Cotton Yarn: Sudden Turmoil in the Yarn Market Due to Planned Takeover of Shen Xin Factory <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Panic Reached Extreme, Resulting in Frequent Low Prices; Intervention by US Military Provided Security, Stabilizing Market</p>
<p>The price of cotton yarn has seen both declines and surges, with inconsistent and disordered trends. This is due to the issue of a potential takeover of the Shen Xin #2 and #9 factories. The yarn market has experienced the turbulence of this tense atmosphere, causing speculators to become frantic. Those holding goods (bulls) are concerned about difficulties in delivery and other complications, leading to widespread selling (mostly becoming bears). 20-count Double Horse yarn factory orders were immediately pressured down to 1,530 yuan, even falling as low as 520 yuan (some even quoted 15 yuan). At the same time, brokers, seeing the severe conditions, were also hesitant to act, resulting in very sluggish trading. Guang brokers only handled 30 bales of 32-count Jinbao Xing, with no other transactions. One can imagine the scattered market sentiment. Large dealers continued to absorb due to raw material concerns, so the general sense of emptiness shifted from weak to strong. However, the range of fluctuations widened daily, with ups and downs of 40-50 yuan. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,568 yuan, and the low price was 1,520 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,570 yuan, falling to 1,557 yuan, and the final price was 1,569 yuan.</p>
<p>Although Double Horse Morning Open had lawyer Ha Hua Tuo issue a notice regarding the property rights of Shen Xin #2 and #9 factories, addressing concerns, people remained fearful. Most in the market were inclined to sell, reaching out in unison. The opening price was 1,530 yuan. However, shouts of selling were clustered, soon falling to 1,522 yuan. Only a certain major dealer absorbed goods from the market, with a large amount. At the same time, there were rumors that the factory was not doing business with communists, and it was heard that US defense forces had entered the factory for protection. Public sentiment was revived, and buying interest increased, tightening the market. The market gradually rebounded to 1,565 yuan, but actual trading also stagnated. However, some profiteers covered their positions. The closing price was 1,568 yuan. The statistics for transactions in the first half of the day show a total of 4,030 bales. The amount of goods purchased by each broker is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 30; Trading Companies 4,000; Total 4,030</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Shen Xin #2 and #9 factories, they were operated by the late industrial magnate Rong Zongjing in the spring of 1937. Factory #2 was purchased from a certain Japanese merchant in 1919, and Factory #9 was purchased from the old San Xin in 1930 (the current site on Macau Road was relocated from Yangshupu Bridge). However, there were no official shares. On the eve of the "August 13th" incident, the factory was taken over by American Enterprise Company, an American merchant, and Factory #9 was taken over by Tonghe 洋行, a British merchant. Therefore, since yesterday, US soldiers have been stationed in the two factories for protection, demonstrating that they are foreign-owned properties and should not be a problem. Thus, public sentiment shifted from panic to calm, and the storm temporarily subsided (Dragon).</p>
<p>Regarding the market conditions of the Jin Double Horse futures market, initially, due to rumors that Chinese merchants' Shen Xin #2 and #9 yarn factories were to be taken over by a certain party, most bulls holding Double Horse factory orders were panic-stricken. It was heard that the opening price of Double Horse factory orders suddenly dropped by 31 yuan, so the bulls in Jin Double Horse opened positions and closed, and short positions took advantage of the situation to pressure the market, with the July contract opening plunging 34 yuan to a price of 1,380 yuan. The August contract was slightly more moderate, with a slight drop of 9 yuan. Unexpectedly, by the September contract, it became clear that the rumors were completely false. New buyers and those covering short positions gradually increased, suddenly rising by 13 yuan. Afterward, because foreign exchange and gold prices were stable, foreign merchants continued to absorb aggressively, gradually increasing. The afternoon closing saw the July contract up 7 yuan, the August contract up 18 yuan, and the September contract up 20 yuan. The difference between near and distant months was as much as 92 yuan. The total transaction volume in the morning was 17,220 bales. The market trend in the afternoon was extremely stable, with prices near high and distant even. As a result, the July contract rose 12 yuan compared to the previous day, the August contract rose 17 and a half yuan, and the September contract rose 27 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,170 bales, an increase of 11,990 bales compared to the previous day. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (net trading prices):</p>
<h3 id="e82">Cotton Market Also Affected <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>—Reduced Effectiveness—</p>
<p>The current cotton situation has been dragged down by the sluggish yarn market, but the continued rise of foreign cotton has helped to maintain public sentiment. However, the loosening of foreign exchange has made trading less effective and not as bustling as in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Finance: Japanese Merchants Continuously Sell Off, Approximately US$4 Million <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw unchanged listed rates by HSBC for various currencies. Small counters listed 0.0625 at 10:00 am, totaling 5.0625. The unofficial market for British and American currencies loosened initially but rebounded later, weakening again in the afternoon. This was because Japanese Zhengjin and other banks dumped huge amounts of US dollars immediately after the morning opening, causing the August contract to briefly harden to 5.634375 for settlement, and US dollars to 3.234375. Soon, Chinese speculators suddenly came in with huge buy-ins, and foreign banks were less willing to offer, slightly improving sentiment. Therefore, the loosening trend of the US exchange rate flattened. In the afternoon, Japanese banks continued to sell, and Chinese merchants continued to buy in. Foreign merchant banks were generally willing to offer, and the market trend hardened again. The British exchange rate continued to weaken sharply, causing both the closing prices of British and American exchange rates to loosen by 0.03125. The total volume traded was extremely high. According to recent reports, Japanese banks have repeatedly sold off US exchange rates, totaling US$4 million as of yesterday. It is feared that there will still be a large amount of selling in the coming days.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Buying In Extensively</p>
<p>Since the morning foreign telegrams reported that the silver market in India was stable, with no movement in the American and British markets, and the foreign exchange rates between various countries and the US and UK remained stable, the central government's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The early morning opening prices of banks in the domestic market were: spot British exchange rate at 3.21875, US dollars at 5.28125. Immediately after the opening, Japanese banks vigorously dumped, and British and American commercial banks were less willing to accept, causing the market to loosen sharply. Japanese banks even dumped spot and August contract US dollars at 5.3125 and 5.34375. The most relaxed Hong Kong telegrams even managed to buy the August contract at 5.34375, which was sold by Chinese firms. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The white silver equilibrium tax was still levied at 23.00%. Chinese speculators saw the lower prices and started to snap up, aggressively buying in the July and August contracts at 5.3125. Foreign commercial banks were even less willing to offer, and gold prices also saw a rebound. The market became tighter at noon, with the closing price at noon for British gold at 3.234375 and US dollars at 5.28125.</p>
<p>Both Futures and Spot Positions Lengthened</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Chinese speculators were still reluctant to buy in the July and August US dollar contracts at 5.3125. Foreign banks were slightly more willing to offer, and Japanese banks came to sell $100,000 USD, making the market slightly harden. The 3:30 pm closing price for both spot and August contract British exchange rate was 3.25, and the US dollar was 5.3125, with both British and American exchange rates lengthening by 0.03125 compared to last Saturday's noon closing.</p>
<p>Retail Investors Selling; US Dollar Notes Depreciated by Three Points</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the Shachi market price fall and then stabilize, with British and American gold pounds also falling and then returning to flat. The British gold note market price was flat, and the US dollar note opened at 18 yuan and 85 cents. After opening, it rose as high as 7 cents, but then Dongsheng Heng, Dagong, Zhenhe, and others came to sell, retreating to 78 cents. Zhicheng, Liji, Baokang, Dinghe, Chengfeng, etc., suddenly rushed to collect, uniformly raising it again to 87 cents. The noon closing price was 86 cents. The afternoon opening price was 84 cents. After the opening, Liji and others came to buy again, raising it to 89 cents. Later, because retail investors sold slightly, the closing price was 18 yuan and 86 cents, depreciated by 3 points compared to last week. The Hong Kong note trend was stable, and the market price was flat. The Japanese gold note was slightly weak, and the evening market retreated to 2 yuan and 1.5 cents. The Korean note trend was stagnant, and the market price was flat, with the evening market still standing at 1 yuan and 41 cents on the original board.</p>
<h3 id="e84">August Contract Enters the Market; Short Positions Continue to Be Active in the Gold Market <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Roll Over Still Done by Short Positions Paying from 45 to 59 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shachi unofficial gold market yesterday was the day for this month's (July) to enter the next month's (August) roll over. As usual, it should be held from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. Therefore, the July contract was still trading in the morning. The market trend changed from weak to firm, because foreign exchange went from loose back to flat. When the floating market selling force saw 6,546 yuan after the morning opening, suddenly the Shanghai West gang rushed to aggressively buy in huge amounts. Yiyuan aggressively entered 10,000+ taels, and Tianyuan covered short positions urgently as well. The rise gradually sharpened by noon, rising to 6,590 yuan. The price trend only stopped when the exchange note merchants released 8,000 taels and Chengji's willingness to sell was good as well. After the selling side released the roll over price to the buying side from 50 yuan, rising to 59 yuan in the afternoon, the August contract entered the market, and short positions started to become active again. It also got help from the renewed loosening of foreign exchange. Hengji, Yida Xinyuanxiang, and Yonghesheng competed to sell, so it gradually went down from 6,543 yuan to 6,522 yuan, finally being squeezed down 67 yuan. Excluding the roll over, it fell 10 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was over 100,000 taels. The cash price went against it and rose instead. In the morning, Zhongxing entered 50 taels in Tianyuan, at a price 330 yuan higher than the (July) futures contract. There was no activity in the afternoon, with the price 370 yuan higher than the (August) futures contract.</p>
<p>Cash Price Goes Against the Trend</p>
<p>Since the morning, due to the sharp loosening of foreign exchange and downward sentiment, the market opened at 9:15 am at a low of 23 yuan lower than the previous day in the selling wind, totaling 6,570 yuan. Chengji sold down to 6,560 yuan. Yiyuan, Yida, Xinfeng, and Yong aggressively entered, raising it to 6,578 yuan. And when it was heard that the August US dollar was available for sale at 5.34375, Hengji, Chengji, and Dafeng sold again, and retail investors followed suit, immediately dropping over 30 yuan, falling to 6,546 yuan. Yiyuan aggressively covered short positions, immediately seeing it raised up. Tianyuan and Yida also started competing to enter, and after 10:30 am, it started to rise step by step. Foreign exchange tightened, and floating shorts urgently reversed into longs, making the rise even faster, soaring to 6,590 yuan. Fortunately, Xinyuan, Hengji, Xinfeng, and Yongchengji sold, suppressing the rising trend. The market closed at noon at 6,586 yuan. In the afternoon, the roll over (July entering August) started at 1:00 PM, with the selling side offering to the buying side, initially shouting 45 yuan, and then Yiyida Tianyuan Gonghe offered, with transactions starting at 50 yuan. The listed price at 1:15 PM was 52 yuan. Although Dafeng, Hengji, and Chengji came to offer, those who rolled over still took the majority. The highest reached 59 yuan, and the final 57 or 8 yuan. The August contract entered the market at 2:00 PM, at 6,540 yuan, which was 46 yuan lower than the noon closing price (July). If 55 yuan for the roll over is deducted, then it is 9 yuan higher. Retail investors started throwing it away all around, falling to 6,530 yuan. Xinfeng and Yong aggressively entered, raising it to 6,543 yuan. Hengji, Yida, Xiangxing, Yonghesheng, and others aggressively sold, and the foreign exchange brought a loose trend, bringing the price down 21 yuan, falling to 6,522 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,526 yuan, which was 67 yuan lower than last Saturday's (July) noon closing. If the roll over buying party offering 57 yuan is deducted, then it is down 10 yuan. The settlement price, according to the August US dollar at 5.3125, was 6,555 yuan, which is a squeeze of 29 yuan. The high and low range for the whole day (excluding the roll over) was 68 yuan. The selling price of cash gold after closing was 350 yuan higher than the futures transaction, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for the current margin.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>The per-liang retail price of jewelry gold at Datonghang and Xintonghang remained at 710 yuan, unchanged, and the purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Food: Rice Prices Unable to Hold Due to Influx of Foreign Rice <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice from Taikoo Company and the Jiangsu Lun arrived at the port in the evening of the 12th, with 22,000 bags of foreign rice loaded from Hong Kong, stopping at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. The Jinan Lun arrived in Shanghai on the 13th, also loaded with 8,502 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, stopping at the wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. The Qingyuan Lun also arrived in port on the 13th, loaded with 7,720 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, stopping at the wharf in Pudong, scheduled to be transferred to the wharf on the Bund of the French Concession this morning for unloading. The Yihuo 洋行's Yusheng Lun arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, loaded with 10,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, stopping at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The above four ships carried a total of 47,222 bags of foreign rice. Except for the foreign rice loaded by the Jiangsu Lun, the rest are all subsidized foreign rice from the Public Works Department. Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Lun arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening, and it is rumored that it also has foreign rice on board, but the exact number is unknown. We will investigate and report further today. In addition, the Zhawua Company's Zisha Danny postal ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying over 4,000 bags of corn from Java, stopping at the Lan Yanchou Wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice fell again by a small amount of 1-2 yuan. At the morning opening, brokers and hoarders in this street responded, and the market was able to hold. However, then many who were making a profit took the opportunity to release their positions, and new arrivals continued to come in. The city's inventory gradually increased, and the gold price drop and exchange rate increase made pricing more favorable. Market rumors were also unfavorable to the bullish side. Under the conditions of less buying and more selling, the market uniformly fell back. Trading in the popular Xiaojiao rice fell from 128.5 yuan to 123 yuan, then to 121 yuan. Saigon No. 1 went from 131.5 yuan to 131 yuan, then to 127.5 yuan. No. 2 went from 125 yuan to 123.5 yuan. Broken rice went from 96.5 yuan to 95 yuan. Min Dang went from 134.5 yuan to 131 yuan. Yinghua Si No. 2 from Siam went from 144 yuan to 143 yuan. The current price for Xiaojiao is 150.05 yuan to 150 yuan. The futures price is 152 yuan to 151.5 yuan. The broken rice price, which opened at 114 yuan previously, was only 112 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 2-3 yuan. Later, the market rebounded slightly as brokers and hoarders took advantage of the lower prices to absorb. However, the market shape ultimately appeared soft.</p>
<p>Due to continuous heavy rain and blocked sources, the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was interrupted. The sellers were determined to sell, but local stores were still not smooth, so the result was only a small improvement of half a yuan. Early and late rice from Nanyang opened at 142.5 yuan, then fell to 139 yuan. Wuxi original-packaged white japonica was 135.5 yuan, and stored japonica was 132-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Whether it was domestic or foreign glutinous rice, sales were sluggish in the retail market. However, the market was barely holding up due to the scarcity of goods in the market. The selling price still lacked any improvement. Hong Kong white opened at 124 yuan to 121.5 yuan, especially 125 yuan, glutinous mung bean 115-6 yuan, and domestic Jintan 127 yuan to 125 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Flour Market Trend Softening <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The trading of spot flour yesterday continued to be sluggish, and the market also tended to soften. This is because the rice price, with the arrival of both stocks and new supplies, showed a fatigued state. The flour market also widely rumored that route cargo and Hong Kong flour were arriving continuously. On the sales side, everyone was thinking about depressing prices and taking goods. Jinlong flour first fell, opening from 32 yuan and 60 cents, loosening to 55 cents and 45 cents. The Paotai flour had opened at 33.5 yuan, but immediately no one accepted it. Other brands, such as Zhonglou and Huawu, were also priced but without a market. The prices of each good were down by 3-5 cents compared to last weekend. Transactions were less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market situation was as quiet as usual. There was no arrival of new wheat from the inland. Haulers have also stopped operations. Only the Japanese factories are sending people to purchase, and the traders operated by the Chinese merchants are already very few. Therefore, the prospect of the wheat market this year cannot be developed at all.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Securities Old Longs Unload; Public Bonds Retreat <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>After two days of rising yesterday, the public bond market again trended downward, indicating that the bullish force had reached the end of its strength with no remaining power to fight. Old long players like Dingkang and Dazhong were already unloading. After multiple failed attempts to push prices higher, they will likely continue to trend downward, though without any major collapses. Yesterday morning, Rund De bought in, initially maintaining the original price. Xie Kang followed, with Tong Kang trailing behind. Initial buying interest was still acceptable, but Dingkang and Dazhong heavily sold off, and Yi Tai also unloaded. Hong Da Lian He also joined the selling side, and market sentiment became depressed. Tong Bing immediately broke through two yuan, with small trades seen at one yuan and two jiao five fen. In the afternoon, Dingkang and Dazhong continued to sell, and transactions cleared, but buyers were scarce. Only Rund De, Tong Shun, and Xin Fu bought in, but in small quantities. Yi Chang also sold. Initially, prices were slightly higher due to efforts to push them up, but they failed to break through two yuan. The closing price was equal to the morning's market, and the trend will likely remain sideways, with selling at highs and buying at lows. The current situation largely depends on the hands of the bulls, and we only need to observe their ability and courage to continue buying. Since there are no major changes in the surrounding environment, some say it is related to the unfavorable war with Soviet Russia, but this is an overreaction. The final market prices uniformly fell by two jiao to seven jiao five fen. The total turnover was close to two million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>One hundred shares of the Bank of China stock were traded at a price of ninety-three yuan. Furthermore, the stock market of the Public Association of Various Industries showed an uncertain trend. The opening was slightly soft, then rebounded, but eventually closed lower, with the lowest price at the close. Xiang Tai stock saw particularly heavy trading, with a uniquely strong upward trend, rising from an opening price of sixty-two yuan to a high of sixty-nine yuan, closing at sixty-seven yuan. Rubber stocks were very quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Oil Cakes Edible Oil and Bean Cakes Both Rise <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Edible Oil Arrivals are still low, and holders continue to have thoughts of hoarding. After the market opened yesterday morning, prices were pulled up again, rising by one, two, or three yuan. A total of fifty pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, thirty barrels of Qingdao raw oil, twenty barrels of bean oil, one hundred barrels of Dalian bean oil, and one hundred and fifty dan of Pudong factory bean oil were sold. The factory delivered over one thousand dan of clear oil in the first half of July and over three thousand dan in the second half of July. (Prices are detailed in the market price column)</p>
<p>Bean Cake The market opened yesterday morning, and short sellers were still eagerly covering positions. In addition, financial and yarn/flower merchants with strong capital frequently gathered supplies, so the market was quite firm. Prices rose again by three, four, or five jiao. A total of one thousand pieces of Kaiyuan Ji bean cake, two thousand pieces of Xing Ji bean cake, and over forty thousand pieces of future bean cake were sold.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Rebounds Strongly in the Afternoon <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth The market started weak but ended strong yesterday. This was due to the calming effect after Shen Xin Factory issued a statement. Fuguil Fine Cloth and Twill Factory orders were sold as usual, but foreign warehouse goods, which were previously two jiao and five fen lower than factory orders, were now at the same price. The results of the cloth sales showed a slight firmness compared to the previous week. Lun Chang and Yi He Factory bleached and colored cloth rose by five jiao per bolt, and coarse cloth rose by two jiao and five fen. Fine cloths and twills from various factories rose by about two jiao and five fen. Over five hundred pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Sales to customers were mediocre. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang brokers handled two to three hundred pieces of colored and bleached cloth. Brokers from the northern Yantai and Qingdao routes handled over one hundred pieces of coarse cloth and绒cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth The morning opening was initially weak due to the decline in yarn, but then the market sentiment turned bullish as futures at the trading exchange rose. Short sellers covered positions, and prices were pulled up throughout the session. The afternoon closing price for the leading fine cloth factory order was forty-nine yuan, one jiao, seven fen and a half to two jiao, rising by about one yuan and two jiao per bolt. The lowest price for colored goods "Four Gentlemen" Serge reached one yuan, five jiao, seven fen and seven five, and the highest rose to one yuan, six jiao, one fen and three seven five, closing at one yuan, six jiao, zero fen and eight seven five. Market sentiment was very strong.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw flat prices for coarse white sugar and tight supplies of refined white sugar. "B" Mark continued to advance. The Association's clearing prices for spot goods were: March imports of No. 24 coarse white sugar at 92 yuan and 8 jiao, April at 93 yuan and 4 jiao, May at 95 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 jiao, and 8 jiao, June 6th imports at 94 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 jiao, June 20th imports at 95 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 jiao, 5 jiao, and 3 jiao, July 20th billing at 95 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 jiao, and 5 jiao, July 30th billing at 95 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 jiao, and 8 jiao. Dutch Red "KD" Mark was at 76 yuan, "NT" Mark at 74 yuan. Taikoo refined white "B" Mark was at 120 yuan, up one yuan and a half. Lower-grade "HX" Mark was flat at 93 yuan and 8 jiao, "HM" Mark at 82 yuan. Seven hundred tons of sugar arrived from Java yesterday, and four thousand six hundred bags of Taikoo refined sugar and six hundred bags of granulated sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The first batch of new Xuzhou golden vegetables arrived yesterday, totaling ninety packages. Due to higher costs, the asking price was not low, and they were sold at 230 yuan, yielding only a small profit. Furthermore, the price of subsequent batches will also be difficult to lower, as other merchants are also sourcing them, causing prices along the way to increase.</p>

The top grade was set at 320 yuan, the Heavenly Grade at 230 yuan, and the Heavenly Grand Grade at 180 yuan. Prices for other original goods were also raised. According to a telegram from Jinjiang, the new harvest will only be 10% of the usual amount, so the trend is particularly tight.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Some young people entering society often express pessimism, believing that all crows are black and seeing only darkness everywhere. In fact, this is not entirely true. While society certainly has its dark sides, it also has a bright side.</p>
<p>Consider this: After this newspaper launched the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, the response was overwhelming, with donations pouring in. In just three days, over one thousand yuan was received. What is particularly touching is that the donors are mostly not wealthy individuals. A young man just out of university donated one hundred yuan, specifying that it should help Mr. Ni with one hundred yuan per semester until he graduates from high school. Fifty-nine female students collectively donated one hundred yuan. Furthermore, an old bookstore owner is willing to help two impoverished students with all their textbooks during their studies at Lida Academy. This enthusiasm fully demonstrates the greatness of the human spirit of mutual aid. The colleagues of this newspaper are willing to dedicate a portion of their energy and time, under the supervision and guidance of our readers, to handle this matter for our readers, ensuring that the human spirit of mutual aid can be further promoted and expanded.</p>
<p>In today's society, everyone, directly or indirectly, has been helped by others, either spiritually or materially, to achieve their current achievements and status. Gratitude and repayment are common to all hearts. We believe that cultivating future talents for society is the most appropriate and meaningful way to repay, and it is also a most worthwhile thing to do. We hope that people from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Mute Can Speak <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xinliang</p>
<p>"The mute eats coptis chinensis; he cannot express his bitterness." These words show that the mute is a pitiful being. Although there are now schools for the mute, and those born mute also have the opportunity to be educated, in reality, their inner pain and suffering are indeed difficult to describe in words.</p>
<p>For a long, long time, we have longed for a scientist or doctor to emerge who can cure "muteness," who can make the mute speak. Recent news has arrived that in Seattle, USA, there is indeed a Dr. Brian T. King who can reorganize the muscles and nerves in the neck of the mute, restoring tension to those muscles in the vocal cords and throat that have lost control.</p>
<p>To date, twenty-six patients have gone to him for treatment. Among these twenty-six people, some could only make rustling sounds, while others could not utter a single sound. As a result, twenty-one of them were finally able to speak with their mouths. One seventy-four-year-old woman, who had always been "silent," can now speak completely like an ordinary person. One thirty-five-year-old, who had been mute for seventeen years, is now a teacher at a school. A female secretary of the American Medical Association in Chicago also underwent surgery by Dr. King and gained the right to "speak." She recently gave a rather long speech at a meeting of the Southeastern Surgical Association in the United States. She spoke so clearly and movingly that hardly anyone would believe that she had once been a "mute."</p>
<p>Dr. King's surgery to cure muteness is very complex, but the most important point is to graft normal, active throat muscles onto the weak vocal cords. He believes that this will definitely create a pleasant and regular sound.</p>
<p>In addition to Dr. King, Dr. Nathaniel Levin, a professor at Temple University in the United States, is also working hard to cure muteness. After three years of continuous research, he has also enabled more than thirty men without larynxes to speak in a short period of time. He uses a method called "expiratory phonation." He forces air into the patient's mouth, and then forces it out from the abdomen. When the rapid air collides with the teeth, sound is produced.</p>
<p>Here, let us earnestly hope that there will be no more mutes in the world in the near future. I believe that many geniuses and great men will be discovered from this unfortunate group of people!</p>
<h3 id="e95">Roosevelt's Preparation Before His Speech <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Gong</p>
<p>President Roosevelt always makes thorough preparations before giving a speech. He first gives the main points of the speech, the tone to be adopted when speaking, and the important phrases or paragraphs he wants to use to his assistants. Then, they each draft a speech based on this. After each person completes their draft, he orders his most trusted typist, Grace Tully, to type each one. He spends two full nights reading each speech, until he finds the one he finds the smoothest and most satisfactory. Once the draft is selected, he then practices in front of his advisors or subordinates, correcting any inappropriate points as he goes.</p>
<p>Whenever he needs to mention diplomatic matters, he always seeks the opinion of Secretary of State Hull, but he also often consults with Undersecretary of State Welles or other officials, such as Adolf Berle and Pierrepoint Moffat.</p>
<p>Berle's strength is that he can insert dignified diction into the speech. Hull often likes to use epigrams and is able to cite clear examples to explain the facts. Welles is an expert on South American affairs, and he often provides sharp and moving tones, making the entire text much more vivid.</p>
<p>After each person has inserted and supplemented the draft in this way, it becomes Roosevelt's official speech, which, when spoken, will surely be relevant and resonate with the audience, without any mistakes.</p>

<p>— Si Zhong</p>
<p>The terror of the fifth columns in various countries is becoming increasingly severe. A spy only needs to have a shortwave radio transmitter to send messages to any location in the world at any time. The cost of constructing a powerful shortwave radio station is only a few pounds. A five-watt transmitter can broadcast messages throughout Europe. For communication with the surrounding area, a one-watt to two-watt transmitter is sufficient.</p>
<p>Hitler founded scientific "spy training schools" in Germany, with a special department dedicated to training students in the use of shortwave transmitters. Educated and skilled administrators are using miniature wireless radios, so Germany is receiving an increasing number of secret telegrams. This has been officially reported and can be verified.</p>
<p>Now, a spy can blend into the crowd and casually tap the device with his hand to transmit messages. His transmitter is hidden in a large cane or even a cigarette case, truly small and exquisite. Some spies have been discovered in British racetracks using miniature transmitters hidden in their clothing, and were unfortunately arrested on the spot.</p>

<p>10. A Father's Heart</p>
<p>"Last summer, didn't an Uncle Zhao come to visit? He stayed at our house overnight and kept talking to you about Mom. He said that Mom had sent people to Li Village, where we used to live, several times to look for us, and had also published two letters in some newspaper, telling us to go find her. Uncle Zhao also said that we should hurry up and find Mom and move into the city to live happily. But you wouldn't listen, and kept shaking your head and sighing at him. Later, you even forced him not to tell her where we lived. You said that as soon as Mom came, you would run away. The next day, when I talked to you about it, you wanted me to go find Mom with Uncle Zhao, leaving you and Xiaogouzi in the countryside. Not to mention that Uncle Zhao didn't agree, how could I agree to that...?"</p>
<p>Mei Bao spoke spiritedly, causing Qiu Haitang to lower his head and remain silent, as if he had fainted.</p>
<p>"Dad, I really don't understand. You said that you and Mom had a big fight over something, so you separated; then why do you always think about her and secretly shed tears? And according to that Uncle Zhao, Mom also thinks about us every day. So, you never fought at all! Dad, right?" As she spoke, she shook her father's body forcefully, wishing he would answer immediately.</p>
<p>But Qiu Haitang stood there like a wooden chicken, not even noticing the raindrops falling from his umbrella onto Mei Bao's head. "If you never fought, why do you want to run away when Mom comes back? Dad, why won't you let her? Dad, tell me! Tell me quickly!" She almost pushed Qiu Haitang over.</p>
<p>Her voice was already very loud, but Qiu Haitang seemed not to hear at all.</p>
<p>"Dad, why won't you say anything...?" Mei Bao burst into tears. "You...you treat...everyone else well...but...but you...won't...won't...bring Mom...back... What happiness...happiness is there for us?"</p>
<p>It was only after Mei Bao had been crying in his arms for a long time that his senses seemed to return.</p>
<p>"Mei Bao, you don't understand!" he said softly in a low voice, as if he were talking in his sleep. "If we really brought her back, you would certainly be happy, and I might even be a little happier than I am now; but she herself would have no more joy!"</p>
<p>He forgot about the heavy rain that was constantly falling from the sky, suddenly threw his umbrella aside, and freed his hands to hug his daughter tightly; without them even closing their eyes, Luo Xiangqi's phantom reappeared in the rain, sinking and floating again and again.

<h3 id="e101">My Thoughts on "Qing Palace Lament" <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Tianfeng Drama Society is preparing to stage a historical drama starting on the 17th, titled "Qing Palace Lament," written by Yao Ke and starring Shu Shi and Murong Wan'er. The theme of the entire play is the Wuxu Reform and the love story between Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen. Because I translated two works by Ms. Deling about the Qing Palace before the war—"Fragrant Shadows of the Imperial Palace" and "Blood Tears of Yingtai"—I have done some research on the historical facts of that time, so Brother Yao Ke asked me to express some opinions on the writing of the script. In fact, the opinions I can express are very limited, but I have already had a "sneak peek" at the script.</p>
<p>Profit-Driven Motives</p>
<p>Regarding historical dramas about the late Qing Dynasty, the focus of interest in the past seemed to be all on Empress Dowager Cixi alone; from "Eunuch An Dehai's Riot on the Dragon Boat" to "The Two Empress Dowagers," what was emphasized was nothing more than an old widow who became more and more legendary and attractive as she got older. I dare not say that all these playwrights suffer from a high degree of "sexual fantasies," but one thing is certain, and that is that their motivation for writing the play focused too much on business sense, and the materials they collected were limited to palace secrets and general unfounded legends, so they were not historical dramas at all, but rather a kind of "fantasy" drama!</p>
<p>Why Regard Trash as Treasure?</p>
<p>There was a time when I heard several theater troupes scrambling to perform "Cixi," and it was said that a certain playwright had already begun writing. I often found it very strange, "Could Cixi be portrayed as a second Ge Nenniang or a second Hong Yijiao?" Of course, I myself know that my reading is limited and my views are narrow. Perhaps what I consider to be a Cixi who had no great achievements or faults in her life, who only knew how to unleash the strong temper that old ladies often have, may be a remarkable female hero in the eyes of others. Perhaps I think that her boldness and talent are not even one percent of those of the Great Golden Wheel Emperor, while others think that she is far above the Wu clan, so they want to put her on the stage as if she were a treasure. But later, thank God, the script was never written. Perhaps people's views are always somewhat similar?</p>
<p>Empress Dowager Cixi is Not Worthy of Mention</p>
<p>But the fall of a dynasty, especially the downfall of the Qing Dynasty, certainly has commendable and lamentable events (the regrets of the late Ming Dynasty are one example). Besides Empress Dowager Cixi, wasn't there anyone else in the late Qing Dynasty worth putting on stage? Empress Dowager Cixi's life certainly has nothing to praise, but were the others as mediocre as she was? I often thought that way. And at the same time, I often thought of Guangxu—the young emperor who could have accomplished great things but was strangled to death by evil forces—and Consort Zhen, whom he cherished throughout his life.</p>
<p>This Play is Flawless</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have never studied playwriting, so although I have this ideal, I cannot make it a reality myself. But I must admit that Yao Ke's writing of this script for "Qing Palace Lament," whether in terms of material, structure, or interweaving, has completely met my ideal. It's even better! So, after I finished reading his script, I gave him four words of criticism: "Flawless." The entire play, including the prologue, consists of five acts and nine scenes, so the play is quite long. The protagonists, Guangxu and Consort Zhen, have scenes in every act and are heavily relied on in every scene, so I think the selection of actors for these two roles will probably be very difficult, right? Now I hear that Shu Shi and Murong Wan'er have been decided to take on the roles. As for how they will perform, that will have to wait until after the performance.</p>

<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>Follow - To follow the rise and fall of the melody, step by step. This is the most important principle for the Huqin.</p>
<p>Pad - Some people think it is a small interlude, but it is not. For the first few notes of each sentence in Xipi, the melody falls on the head eye, middle eye, and tail eye, and must be padded with Gongche. For example, in "Selling the Horse," the "suffering misfortune" is padded with "Gong Wu Liu Liu," and in "Empty City Stratagem," the "I am originally" is padded with "Gong Fan Gongche." When the Dan sings, such as in "Visiting Mother," the "Could it be" is padded with "Si Yi Si Liu, Gong Si." Also, in the Erhuang play, the "He Hou Scolding the Palace," the "scolding" in "scolding sound" is followed by "Si Yi He Si, Si Che Yi Si." In the same play, the "kicking and punching" is followed by "Si Fan Gongche Yi, Si Yi Si He." There are many examples of this, too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Supplement - At the point where the singing melody is interrupted, Gongche is used to connect it. Mei Yutian entrusts "Hong Yang Cave" with the melody of "At the third watch, I dreamed of" as "Che Che, Che Gong Yi Si, He Si Che Gong, Yi Si He Si, Yi Che, Gong He, Si Che, Yi Si," which is fluent and lively, and is an excellent example of the wonder of following, padding, and supplementing. There are many different opinions on Huqin fingering, and I think the three words "cut, shake, slide" are the most important. "Cut" means to press it firmly and make a precise and accurate sound. The meaning of "shake" is very clear, and it is used in long notes. "Slide" has both upward and downward slides, and it is used at the beginning and end of sentences. If you master these three methods, you can understand all other methods such as touching, breaking, and kneading.</p>
<p>The rosin on the Qintong should be thin; if it is thick, it will form a groove, hindering the bow hair and preventing it from sticking tightly to the string. The bow hair should be sparse; if there is too much, the sound will be rough.</p>
<p>The rising tone character in the lyrics is always produced with a glissando, with a large "six slip to 仩" for the same melody, then slipping back to "six", or to "six four". The two dramas "Li Ling Stele" and "Wu Jia Ban" have the most examples.</p>
<p>Mei school's Qin is suitable for Sheng, Sun school's Qin is suitable for Dan.</p>
<p>The "Six Wu Yi" etc. of Erhuang are all supported by low notes. Sun Zuochen's fingers are particularly long, and his playing of the interlude in Erhuang often has "Six Wu Yi Shi", which is truly an extraordinary talent!</p>
<p>Both Xipi "Si Yi" and "Wu Yi" exist, one on the inner string and one on the outer string, depending on which is more convenient for the bowing method.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Helplessness Like Ning Wu</p>
<p>Liu Yinying went outside for a stroll, obtained some fodder from the old monk, and fed it to the two horses. He also spoke with the old monk for a moment. Returning to the cloud chamber, he saw that Xu Jing was still asleep and dared not disturb him. At dusk, the old monk lit a crimson candle and asked Liu Yinying if he still wanted some porridge, as there was nothing else to eat in the ancient temple. Liu Yinying felt pity for the old monk, so he took two taels of silver from his pocket and gave it to him, instructing him to cook some more porridge and not to prepare anything else. The old monk gratefully thanked him and left. After a while, Xu Jing awoke, the pain in his arm still present, but his spirits felt better. Seeing Liu Yinying sitting in front of the couch, he said, "Has it gotten dark already?" Liu Yinying, seeing Xu Jing awake, asked him if his injury was alright. Xu Jing told him that the pain had not stopped, but it would likely be alright. He was worried about Ning Wu Pass, and he would struggle to get up tomorrow to go and kill the bandits together. Liu Yinying comforted him with a few words. The old monk brought the porridge again, still with the same vegetables from the daytime. Xu Jing ate another bowl. After Liu Yinying finished eating, he walked into the courtyard to check on the two horses. He suddenly looked up and saw a patch of red light in the southeast corner of the sky, growing larger and larger, and its direction was Ning Wu Pass. He felt somewhat alarmed in his heart and quietly jumped onto the roof, looking towards that direction and indeed seeing Ning Wu Pass. He thought to himself that perhaps the roaming bandits had already invaded the pass and were setting it ablaze. Then what about General Zhou? He only hated that he had arrived too late to contribute even a small effort. He felt extremely remorseful. He gazed for a long time, but the fire still had not died down. He heard the old monk coughing behind him, and fearing that the old monk would make a commotion, he immediately jumped down from the roof. The old monk pointed to the sky and said, "This firelight is probably coming from Ning Wu Pass. Oh dear! Ning Wu Pass must have fallen." Liu Yinying quickly waved his hand at him and said, "Don't be alarmed, lest General Xu in the room hears it and becomes worried. I forbid you to say more." The old monk could only obediently retreat.
