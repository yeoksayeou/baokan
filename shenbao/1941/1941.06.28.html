<p>社評</p>
<h3>工商界應善護其南洋貿易</h3>
<p>邇來有謂上海各廠出品運銷於南洋者復盛，是亦受歐戰擴大之影響，南洋各地需要，不得不退而求諸滬；然滬上所能供給者恐遠非上决歐戰時可比。蓋上决歐戰時，中國工業尙無目前之發達，而中國物產流通自如，周轉無礙，力足以應各方之需求。今國內貨運，節節被阻，物物皆貴；外則輪船缺乏，水脚飛漲，戰禍且有波及全地球之虞。各工廠所處之地位，遂遠異於前，在昔棉花小麥自給有餘，故紡織製粉各業無不發達異常；此則各廠原料無一不外求，一旦海外有事，原料不繼，勢將停業以待。絲織業有自鳴其營業發展者，苟一問其原料，固東郭燔間乞餘之流也。又一問大批染織布疋，其中爲眞正華資華廠華織者有幾，孰能不出以改頭換面掩耳盜鈴之欺詐手段。事實所在，無庸諱言，言之亦徒滋痛心。</p>
<p>惟於南洋去路發展之際，不忍默爾不言者，則以南洋華僑惓懷祖國，情殷愛護，推銷國貨，不遺餘力，其挣扎奮鬥之精神，稍具良知，未嘗不知敬佩；而應如何所以協助之，聯絡之，優惠之，便利之，以發展南洋華僑之地位，用以推銷我中華國產，保持我宋元以來民衆自動在海外經營之勢力，爲國人共有之職責。而無如所見所聞有大異於是者，雖非謂工商界皆然，第積習相沿，人心奸險，不無使親者痛而仇者快。蓋聞遇滬上貨品銷路疲　，則竭力向南洋推銷，及滬市轉機，又思就地發售；甚至南洋有同樣之定貨，故昂其値，或不肯承攬，或交貨不依期，致使僑商徒勞往返，坐失時機，此爲有事有人無事無人所予人以不快之印象。再則貨樣常與所交付之貨品不符，偸工减料，精窳雜見者有之，色澤花樣不相符；幅度不中程者有之，不顧信義，不期遠大，但侔近利之卑劣心理，在流品樣雜之工商界中，又不能必其無。夫一地之銷路，須合於一地之人情文化，氣候好尙，中國工商界往往味於此種法意，但知閉門造車，出門合轍，在無競爭之時代，尙虞衰落，何况商戰劇烈如今日，有不被淘汰之理？且一地之政治經濟，如商品關稅之輕重，市塲勢力之所在，無一不與出品有成本高低銷路廣狹之關係，常有爲數支之紗，數元之値之出入，而徵稅大相懸殊。故必先之以實地調查，隨時考察，務使處處合於實際，不有意外之損失，予承銷人以便利，則定貨之來，未有不趨之若鶩。商品既爲承銷人所銷售，允應尊重承銷人之意旨，承銷人以爲式樣應如是，質地應若何，則其所好而為之製造；如其不能，亦惟有竭其所能，勉副承銷人之所欲。即貨樣已定，而臨時認爲有修改之必要，亦應就其可能之範圍內，量爲修正。此外如匯市之高昂，政令之改革，時局之推移，氣象之轉變，均息息與工商事業有相聯而至之影響。奈何處此錯綜複雜之時代，猶思用簡單腦筋，陋劣心理，爲可應付，爲能維護，南其轅而北其轍，一己失敗何足惜，亦且影響於國計民生爲可恨耳！</p>
<p>我中國對外貿易，事事不如人，運輸仰於人，居間買賣仰於人，金融匯兌仰於人，其能直接者有幾。幸而稍占地位，亦祇我刻苦耐勞之僑商，當初大都爲飢寒所驅，不能容身於祖國，乃走而之南洋，胼手胝足之力，勤儉積蓄之功，雖迭遭强有力有保護之民族重重壓迫，而仍不失其潛在之勢力；正爲我民族優秀之德性，每於困苦艱難危亡之秋，發揚光大，遂得卓爾自能生存蕃殖於世界。我滬上工商界，焉可不更加淬厲，與僑商內外一力，誠信相孚，維繫於不敝。豈可自抉藩籬，予人以抵隙乘間之機會，斲喪利權於無形哉！</p>
<p>羅軍被迫作戰渡河終未得逞</p>
<p>路透社二十七日倫敦電蘇聯情報局發表公報稱、被俘羅兵言、羅軍每一聯隊、均有德官兵四十名予以監視、因德軍司令部不信任羅兵也、德方砲隊置於羅軍後方、强迫羅兵作戰、蓋羅兵反對戰爭且反對穗人也、羅國傑賽城某軍事目標、爲我軍之襲　目的、被炸後　毀重大、某砲兵師指揮官曼琴同志協助步兵、擊退在某地強渡普魯特河之敵兵、　琴擇定瞭望地點而發現敵軍最弱之點、即於敵軍開始渡河時發砲猛轟、毀敵軍浮橋三、且搫壞敵砲六尊、敵軍受創、未得渡河入蘇境、</p>
<p>瓦斯社二十六日匈羅邊界某地電本日此間所獲前綫作戰消息甚爲稀少、藍羅京方面力避洩露有關普魯特河及布柯維納區之軍事情報、據聞安托納師古將軍指揮之羅軍及李斯特將軍統帥之德軍現仍繼續挺進、即將到達德尼斯產河西岸、按該河爲貝薩拉比亞省及蘇聯本部之界綫、淮欲渡此河則不甚容易、因蘇軍曾在東岸築有堅固工事、若以地勢而論、則於德羅實屬較為有利、良以西岸較東岸之平原高出三百尺、德羅聯軍正可居高臨下、奧迪薩港在此河之東二十五英里、現停泊該港之蘇聯船隻已有一部駛去、足證蘇方業已顧及法港之危險、本日蘇方曾出動飛機四百架、大舉轟炸羅國各地、被炸各都市計有康斯坦柴港·都爾賽亞港·及加拉茲·傑賽·與蘇利那諸城云、</p>
<p>芬蘭牽入漩渦芬北戰事爆發</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十六日芬京電頃據此間官方消息稱、自芬蘭宣佈蘇芬兩國戰爭狀態存在之後、德軍即在芬蘭東北部薩拉一帶採取攻勢、（按薩拉爲自蘇聯北部茂曼期克港通至芬蘭鐵路之終點、於一九三九年蘇芬戰爭時、被蘇聯兼併）雙方空軍亦與陸軍採取聯合行動、蘇空軍曾炸芬蘭東南部、允以戈特嘉港爲甚、合衆社二十七日芬京電　昨日此間正式宜佈、蘇聯飛機三十八架分三隊、於星期三空襲芬蘭之特爾古港、據悉、該城郊外之工人區遭受損失、房　落爆炸彈及燃燒彈如雨、死數名、傷二十七名云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十七日瑞典京城電此間報紙所得芬京之消息稱、昨日下午五時至七時希　新基　聞激烈之大砲聲、該砲聲係傳自南方、相信係蘇聯海軍與芬蘭陸軍交綏云、</p>

<p>昨日洋米先漲後跌、市面仍在盤旋過程中、各檔現洋米早市漲起一二元、中市回小一二元、結果仍乏出入、惟英華司（一石二斗半）原包有客帮轉口去路、市價仍見盤漲半元至一二元不等、早市即有寗波內地鄕莊各帮問津、又洋棧存底調查一百零五萬包略减、新囤亦乘機拖辦、故各米一致上升、繼因邇日到頭甚多、其中散容浮多之浮存籌碼、均圖隨市吐出、行情一漲、立即售出、故漲後立被抑平、而結果仍以客戶拉拖英華司而帶俏、英華司二號暹邏六下七上開一百三十九元、一百四十一元半至一百四十二元、路碎米一百十五六元、期一百十四元半、小紋現路貨自一百四十九元三五角至一百五十元、成交不下一千五六百噸、現米成交一萬八千包、計一號西貢一百二十九元至一百二十七元、二號一百二十五元、次一百二十一元半、碎米丸十九元至九十六元八角、次九十一二元、暹邏一號一百三十一元、又米茶一百零二元半、敏黨一百三十二元半、一百二十八九元、小紋一百二十五元至一百二十三元半、茄佛一百二十六元、</p>
<h3>經濟樷談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>經濟　（二）</p>
<p>「唯天下至誠，爲能經綸天下之大經，立天下之大本，知天地之化育，夫焉有所倚。」</p>
<p>此則特地提出天下之大經，而曰經綸之，是則經綸一字固何謂也？集註有云：</p>
<p>「經綸皆治絲之事，經者，理其緒而分之：綸者，比其類而合之也。大經者，五品之人倫，大本者，所性之全體也。惟聖人之德，極誠無妄，故於人倫，各盡共當然之實，而皆可以爲後世法，所謂經綸之也。」</p>
<p>於是後世之於經綸　字，爲有經世治國之意。而講才學優長者爲滿腹經綸，亦從此中脫胎而出。至濟之爲義，余以爲本於易經繫詞之。</p>
<p>「智周乎萬物，道濟天下。」</p>
<p>之濟爲近，蓋道濟天下　，猶是經綸天下之大經之謂也。唐太宗之名世民，亦爲其四歲時，有書生請見唐高祖，並請見其諸子。相太宗，謂其有天目之表，年幾冠，必能濟世安民。及書生去，高祖追之不見，以爲神，乃以世民名之。然此猶未足寫余說之證，近閱新唐書至裴度傳，而見古人對於經濟二字之意義固如是，史云：</p>
<p>「時（唐文宗時）閹豎擅威，天子擁虛器，摺紳道喪，度（裴度）不復有經濟意。乃治第　都集賢里，…號綠野堂，至白居易劉禹錫爲文章把酒，窮畫夜相歡，不問人問事。」</p>
<p>裴度在當時出將入相，功業在人閒，繫天下安危，及後見宦豎弄權，（按唐中葉之後八主，七爲宦官立，）不復有經濟意，此經濟二字　義之偉大，蓋言其不復作洽國平天下，經世濟民之想也。不似今之談經濟，僅拘拘於財貨方面而言，遠達　義。如比擬於今之學術名詞，則以「政治權濟一况舊時所謂「經濟」，庶幾有相似處，　猶未盡其意。</p>
<p>又如光緒拳匪之恢，厲行新政，會仿博學鴻詞科舉行經濟特科，一觀其拔擢人選之資格，亦即可見中國經濟　字之原意。其人選爲何？即</p>
<p>「志慮忠純，規模閎遠，學問深通，洞達中外時務者。」（未完）</p>
<p>洋米接踵而來、太古公司嘉應輪於昨日傍晚到滬、由暹邏直接運來洋米六千包、又經　港裝來工部局平價洋米五千零零六包、進口後停靠浦東華通碼頭、今晨移泊浦西法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、因霉雨運綿、到貨續斷、市氣更堅、而本鄉店銷自經兩日淸淡後、昨則納胃稍濃、故兩粳行情見提元砠、開南港新鮮早晚稻一百三十七元至一百三十四元、中關原包一百三十五元、無錫原包宿粳一百三十一元至一百三十元、中决一百二十七八元、</p>
<p>糯米依然平淡無奇、銷滯貨稀、兩相平埒、售價仍乏變化、繼開香港高元一百二十二三元、中關一百十七八元、糯菉一百十三元至一百零六元、國元自連日貶短後、引起零胃活動、行情亦見轉定、無甚上落、開一百二十元、中關、一百十八元、</p>
<h3>洋粉仍有來源</h3>
<p>洋麵粉又有到埠、前日太古公司漢陽輪由香港運來麵粉二萬餘包、巳誌昨報、茲悉昨日該公司嘉應輪到滬、除運來大批洋米外、亦有麵粉一千包、從香港裝來、今日起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋粉市况復形堅挺、蓋自運日市價回鬆後、引起本客實銷、雖爲數不鉅、米糧回堅聲中、人心漸趨良好、計開金龍粉澳粉三十二元至三十二元一角、比前已回升半元、尙有紅日當天粉三十二元三角、及砲台粉三十二元七八角、問此决香港裝來美粉四萬餘包、中爲五燕牌及砲台等牌、故砲台粉售價尙未見升、共他雜牌、亦屬買賣兩寂、又聞回籠本廠粉綠兵船、亦有少數配開、價爲三十二元、平賣粉仍爲二十九元、批出五千餘包、小麥仍無正市、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆仍感不安　豆餅因港銷回振</h3>
<p>黃豆市况、昨仍疲弱、人心尙呈不安狀態、浮囤散戶續有削價傾吐、行情又降半元至元餘、統市售開天津金元五百包價爲四十七元半、歸穗黃豆百包、價爲四十一元三五角、膠州黃豆二百五十包、價四十四元四角至四十四元、悉係本街零星去路、</p>
<p>連朝慘落之豆餅市况、昨因港銷略有活動、人心稍見轉機、投機商又圖掙扎而起、故行情頓吿回振三四角、計售開甡記豆餅現貨三千片、期貨三萬多片、（價詳市價欄）、</p>
<p>二十八日出口豆子七百零五包、運香港、豆子八十包、運厦門、餅豆七千七百塊、運香港、豆油六百十五件、運香港、生油一千二百五十聽、運厦門、</p>
<h3>疋頭　染廠需求布疋</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市昂騰、乃因染廠需用增繁、投機囤戶有搜羅、而同業及本街批發號心思轉昂、購意亦濃、各布售盤均見上漲、結果白貨每疋漲二角半至五角、漂布府綢及深色細綫布每疋漲五角左右、綸昌漂布色布扳價、每疋漲一元至二元、本街成交各布六百餘件、粵港南洋帮辦蓋布色布漂布漂斜等四百餘件、北路靑島烟臺各帮辦粗布色布一百餘件、今日有疋頭一千一百十件運香港、六件運厦</p>
<p>東布　咋本街實銷仍旺、價續升騰、白貨龍頭細布棧單晨開四十七元五角、逐盤拉上、至午盤爲四十八元一角半、後市最高到四十八元四角、收盤四十八元二角半、中檔彩球飛魚更形缺俏、每疋較漲八九角、色貨四君子嗶嘰高峰一元六角一分二釐半、晚收時獲利者吐售、回降至一元六角零二釐半、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子　漲風稀有</h3>
<p>狂跳已久之黑鐵坯子、邇來漲風尤熾、蓋海外來源不繼、需要尙感不敷、流通貨更形枯竭、一時大有被搜吿罄之象、於是人心在熱、業此者心恩高昂、標準漲風居五金品之首席、查昨市老鋼廠貨每二千磅已喊四千元、而新鋼廠貨亦售三千九百元、較之前市竟暴漲達二三百元、實爲最近以來市面中所稀見、</p>
<p>新盤元因受木廠釘之影響、市勢盤旋良久、喊價常徘徊在二百二十元左右、進亦不多、退則殊稀、查其原因、蓋其出產物－本釘－之銷路、不甚通暢、僅依本埠生意、如建築幫以及零星散戶等之採辦、爲數極爲有限、最近以還、囤戶之吸風亦减、巳早不如昔時之蓬勃、市象一滯、趨勢難佳、雖米現下降狀態、然終亦難以勗騰、其最近市勢巳可見一斑、</p>
<h3>煤炭　鴻基白煤飛俏　－囤戶作崇－</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、近月到貨、雖尙　躍、但市塲及一般國戶、鑒於航運環境轉變、囤積之心、油然而生、大量吸收現貨、市勢爲之一振、同業行拆每噸四百三十元、昨開送到客戶、提塊每噸四百七十二元、飾塊四百六十八元、統煤四百六十元、行槓外費、一切在內、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白升降互見</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢升降互見、粗白疲軟、車白回好三角、公會劃盤二四號粗白外棧六月份到貨開盤、比前日小二角、爲九十元零二角至一角、九十元、計降四角、太古車白Ｂ嘜一百零六元至一百零六元二角、三角、升三角、而下檔未見起色、ＤＹ嘜東棧貨丸十四元八角、ＨＸ嘜東棧八十八元、與前日相同、然交易亦無多、</p>

<h3>福克斯自渝來滬　研察滬金融情況　接晤金融領袖切實檢討　預定留此兩週返渝覆命</h3>
<p>外匯平準基金管理委員會特派美籍委員福克斯ManuelFox偕其　辦泰萊博士Wiuiam　Taylor由渝飛港、於前晨十時三十分、乘渣華船公司之芝沙尼加號輪抵滬、下榻華懋飯店、進行考察上海及淪陷區域幣制金融以及外匯黑市狀况、常即召集中中交三行上海分行負責人、並於咋日晤見匯豐　麥加利。花旗等銀行經理作深切之垂詢、並舉行初步之商討、聞福氏等在滬的有二星期之躭留、即行赴港、轉渝覆命、茲將福克斯氏來滬使命、與中外銀行經理會見情形、及在港渝所發表之書面談片、分別詳載如决、</p>
<p>福克斯氏近影</p>
<p>縝密研究　上海金融</p>
<p>福克斯與其幫辦泰萊兩氏、於前晨十時半乘荷輪芝沙尼加號抵滬、本市中外銀行界要員、聯袂赴新關碼頭迎接、福氏登陸後、先與各歡迎者一一握手致意、旋即驅車赴南京路華懋飯店休息、對中外記者拒言此來之使命、惟於下午二時、召集中央·中國·交通·三銀行上海分行負責人員、並於咋日延見英商滙豐·麥加利·美商花旗等三銀行經理郝樞民·霍浦金·等、對上海外匯黑市以及金融幣制狀况、有所縝密檢討、作初步之硏究、今日起仍將繼續就各項問題、作具體之商決、</p>
<p>中美經濟　密切合作</p>
<p>福氏來滬後、對名報記者往訪拒不發表任何言論、但以其在港渝所發之演詞出示、共言云、「中美兩國間所訂定之外匯平準基金、乃爲兩大民主國合作之協定、此兩大民主國現正以種種方法共同合作、以鞏固自由之基礎、余（福氏自稱）被任爲此平準基金委員會之美方代表、殊覺榮幸、蓋余確信此平準基金、爲促進兩國福利之重要因素、及顯有穩定兩國幣値之功能也、中美兩國在幣制方面之合作、業有多年、今决新協定之成立、尤爲兩國合作成功之例證、俾得維持甚至改善太平洋之和平與秩序、並證明美國巳認淸中國巳盡其最大之則任、而成爲遠東經濟政治之安定因素、此項基金、不僅足使中國維持及發展其對外貿易、且爲國內復興建設之所賴、中國並與英國訂立一協定、由英國貸予外匯平準基金五百萬鎊、此與中美協定相同、中英·中美·此種協定、爲世界三大洲主要民主國家友誼關係之有力之表證、甚爲國際經濟合作之良好模範、並預期當能安渡目前危難之時期、</p>
<p>注重維持　黑市外滙</p>
<p>至昨前兩日福氏與金融界會議之內容、因事關重要嚴守秘密、據新聲社記者昨向銀行界負責方面探得可靠消息、此决商討之中心、在着重上海黑市外匯之維持、蓋平準基金委員會鑒於上海為遠東唯一大埠、中國金融之樞紐、全國貿易之重心、爲顧全友邦各國對華貿易起見、對上海黑市外匯、決予繼續維持、願與各友邦銀行通力合作、務使中國法幣與英美匯率、得有永久之安定、聞匯豐等銀行對平準基金委員會之措施、均久予以通力協助合作、以利進行、</p>
<p>市塲安定　滙價不變</p>
<p>上海金融市塲、自經中·中·交·三行竭力維持後、穩定如恒、至於外匯黑市、因平準基金委員會繼續維持、以及美籍委員福克斯之抵滬、所以市塲謠言全息、人心安定、英商匯豐銀行外匯掛牌不動、使投機者無法操縱、英美匯率價無榮辱、而中央銀行上海分行公佈之法定外匯、迄無變動、實際外匯交易、成交寥寥、至於金子以及各商品市塲、因黑市外匯趨穩、均亦無多大上下、</p>
<p>兩人均為　經濟專家</p>
<p>福克斯氏美本薜文尼亞省費城人、於一九二年畢業康乃爾大學、得工程師學位、一九二四年、得紐的大學碩士學位、歷任密歇根省稅制委員會檢察員·帝國美術金屬公司效率專家·及紐的中央鐵路公司評價委員會助理、並在數大學執敎、此外又爲美國稅制委員會各部部員、一九三九至一九四零年問、氏任美國赴委內瑞拉之經濟顧問團主席、此决奉命爲中國外匯平準基金委員、乃於今年五月一日由美財長摩根韜發表、泰萊氏在就任福克斯氏幫辦前、任爲美財部貨幣研究所經濟專家、原爲夏威夷大學遠東時事敎授多年、今年一月、方入美財部服務、氏於一九三五年得加利福尼亞大學哲學博士學位、當年及次斬即在歐洲各國作周密之考察、</p>
<h3>滬德商定下月起　縮短營業時間　貨件暫存於日方貨棧內　運貨前往德境已受阻撓</h3>
<p>據消息靈通方面獲悉、自歐戰發生後、西伯利亞鐵道即爲德國對遠東之經濟生命綫、惟自蘇德戰事爆發後、本市德商即蒙極大之損失、是以此間穗商、已決定於下月一日起、</p>
<p>縮短　營業</p>
<p>時間、自每日八小時減至五小時、（即自每晨八時起至午後一時止）同時前擬由日本商輪載運赴德之貨物、因不能運輸、故均暫存於日方貨棧內、據某德商語記者稱、蘇聯在滬人士、早已知悉蘇德關係行將緊張、故曾以二項步驟阻撓本市德商運貨前往本國、其辦法爲（一）</p>
<p>增加　運費</p>
<p>至百分之八百、（二）對德方在滬所購貨物、欲經過蘇境運往本國者、加以留難、致不易領取過境之准許證、現在行駛德國上海間之德輪全停、德對滬貿易幾全停頓、而德貨之運滬、以顏料西藥洋針爲大宗、華貨輸德、以鑛砂工業原料居多、</p>
<h3>德僑要求　變更郵綫</h3>
<p>本埠德僑商會爲便利郵遞起見、曾會議決定、要求將德國與上海間郵件、改山南美運德、並由日輪運輸、現已開始實行、惟係取道美國轉運、蓋目前美德兩國關係尙未瀕決絕、故預料當無何礙難、嗣後則須視國際局勢演變而定、至上海寄往歐洲郵件、原係循西伯利亞鐵道封發、近因德蘇戰事影饗、歐洲蘇聯及波羅的海萊沙尼亞、立陶宛、拉脫維亞與土耳其五國外、其他德、芬、羅、意等國郵件、則均停止取道該綫、改經太平洋綫裝運、封發决數改爲每週兩决、至中歐各國郵件、則改由滬裝輪運美、至舊金山改裝火車而抵紐的、再轉裝郵輪運往歐洲、</p>
<h3>陪都新聞界　唁李駿英</h3>
<p>大美晚報副經理李駿英氏、於本月二十三日遇害後、各方深致痛悼、紛紛致電李氏遺屬唁慰、茲悉陪都新聞界續有唁電來滬、一爲中央社、「大美晚報轉李駿英先生家屬鑒、駿英先生盡瘁新聞事業、身處危地、持正不苟、乃竟殉職、遠道聞此、哀悼無已、謹電致唁、尙祈勉節哀忱、善成先志爲禱、中央社叩有」、一爲中國新聞學曾、「大美晚報轉李駿英先生家屬鑒、茲聞駿央先生遇害、吾新聞界又弱一個、忠正溘逝、曷勝驚悼、謹此奉唁、用申哀悃、尙祈順變節哀、以襄大事爲禱、中國新聞學會叩有」、</p>
<h3>太平洋颶風　威脅沿海　氣候惡劣　溫度特低</h3>
<p>本埠昨日霉雨仍在繼續中、氣溫頗低、宛臨三秋、太平洋颶風、則已迫近台灣、向中國進行、大通社記者探錄各情如後、</p>
<p>繼續大雨</p>
<p>據大通社記者向徐家匯天文台深悉、本埠天氣、仍爲霉季所控制、因長江流域、氣象均呈惡劣、大雨在繼續中、上海自暫無轉晴之望、緣雨水不及洩瀉、而浦江又有高潮、馬路積水、遂無法洩瀉、低窪之處、猶積潦在洋、</p>
<p>颶風行進</p>
<p>昨日氣溫、亦特別趨低、據徐家匯天文台紀錄、淸晨五時問之最低溫度、祇六十七度三、不類盛夏、彷彿三秋、至太平洋新颶風、昨晨六時、已進抵北緯十七度、東經一百二十五度之處、向北西方向推進、風力未悉、</p>
<p>威脅沿海</p>
<p>查上報方位、颶風已在呂宋東面一百餘海里之問、有進迫台灣趨勢、我國東南沿海、亦開始受共嚴重威脅、故天文台及江海關、均在注意共發展、以憑指示航行以合宜之規避、而免襲擊、</p>
<h3>中外團體慶祝　國際合作日</h3>

<p>近三年來界外區域小工業突飛猛晋、終以未經任何　市政機關之管理、以致該區出水所恃之溝渠設備、强半損壞、一遇大雨、而水流經鄰近道路、轉入租界西區溝渠內、該區而積、等於租界中西兩區之大、則其流水之影響所及、當可想見、該區幅員之廣、旣如上述、益以建築林立、道路稀少、故除採取若干改進措旅以外、不能設計任何具體改良辦法、在愚園路地豐路一帶之溝管上、已裝置如上述之設備、並使與愚園路之幫浦站相銜接、此外極司非而路惇信路與安和寺路一帶、已分別改築塡高、並經敷設巨型新溝管矣、（續完）</p>
<h3>表兄妹戀愛　雙服毒　兩人在大中學肄業　竟然服毒雙雙殞命</h3>
<p>法租界霞飛路一八一一號無錫女子李智和、現年十六歲、肄業於南洋模範中學、其雙親遠在重慶、有表兄朱仲明者、現年二十三歲、在交通大學攻讀、寄寓於李家、兩人情感彌篤、不意李之雙親、特拍電來滬、着智和暑假後赴渝、詎仲明竭力阻其遠行、使李進退維谷、一則迫於嚴命難違、一則感於情侶難捨、雙方同意、效作同命鴛鴦、於昨日下午四時、均吞服重量毒汁藥水自盡、後經女傭等發覺、亟報吿法捕房、召救護車趕到、飛送紅十字會醫院、療治不及、未幾竟均殞命、</p>
<h3>法租界監獄　囚犯絕食　共計四千餘人　要求改善待遇</h3>
<p>法租界馬斯南路監獄、全體囚犯四千餘人、因待遇及食料極爲苛刻、過去會一再請求改善、仍迄無效果、乃於昨午十二時起、一律絕食、要求改善、</p>
<h3>法電銅匠工頭　險遭謀害</h3>
<p>法商電氣公司銅匠間工頭石全福、現年三十五歲、本地人、賃居於伕租界貝勒路七九二號、於兩星期前、會被人用斧圖害未成、於昨晚八時許、石在自己門口納凉、不意又有一人突如共來、擬出示手槍、狀如狙擊模樣、其時幸石機警、亟返身躱去、一面幷在吹警笛、行兇者見事敗露、乃囊械竄逸無踪、石倖免斯難、然已飽受一塲虛驚、</p>
<h3>福克斯讚重慶民氣　談美國援華步驟</h3>
<p>中國平準基余委員會義國委員福克斯，對陪都民衆在日機轟炸時之精神激昂興恪守紀律，贊譽備至。據稱，渠在渝駐足十一日，巳遇六决空襲。凡在渝市稍作勾留者，俱感該市民衆之精神奮發，紀律嚴明，從辦公處隔窗眺望，市民忽忽往來，旋在顯明地點，空襲信號升空，則見民衆絡繹避入防空壕，熊度鎭定，秩序井然。渠在陪都時，曾遇六次轟炸，不得不調整其工作時間，以便從事研究。</p>
<p>供給中國　大量軍器</p>
<p>福氏在香港時，曾對各報記者談，美國現正盡其力量，以充分之軍需器材，供給中國，以作總反攻之用。美國之援助中國，現正採取下列三種方式：（一）根據租借法案，無需現款，以各種軍械及必需之物品，供給中國，此在以　雖　現款，亦不易購得。（二）進出口銀行貸款予中國，使向美國購買麵粉·棉花·織物·貨車·建築滇緬公路用之瀝靑土及其他種種材料，而中國則以鎢·錫·銻·桐油·及其他物品作爲抵償。（三）外滙平準基金用以穩固中國之法幣幷成立商業信用合的。福氏復稱，美巳華備大量之軍械，即遲至中國，爲使用此種物資，而於最近新成立之「中國國防物資供應委員會」，係由宋子文氏任主席，業已在華盛頓開始辦公。福氏復稱，數月前羅斯福私人代表來華　察之寇里氏，現正以其全部時間，硏究美國物資援華之各項有關問題。」</p>
<p>維護民主　共同作戰</p>
<p>又六月十日，福氏在香港美僑總會即席演說，謂「吾人面對諸多艱難繁複之問題，如能循此種友誼合作之精神以處理之，當不難獲得滿　之解決。余等欣悉美國人士，在遠東方面備受歡迎，而中英美三國人士眞摯之友誼，更無庸贅述。英美在東方之合作，與其在西方者相同，此點尤屬明顯。兩國在西方對抵抗侵略，維護民主，有其共同之利害，其程度幷不减於東方，爲民主主義而抗爭，固不分東西，此早爲世人所盡知。今日世界同情民主之國家，均已深信東方民主國實力之增强，無異增强西方民主國之實力。」</p>
<p>福氏繼曰：「余敢獲證，現在美國人民對於中國，具有最眞切誠摯之同情。兩國友誼之親睦，允稱前所未有。吾人正多方與中國合作，余等今所從事者，即屬經濟方面，中國因遭受侵略，經濟方面所感之困難尙鉅，中國政府對此，不斷注意，幷設法解除，吾人盼能盡其微力，以促共成。」</p>
<h3>支解女屍慘案　捕房查明真相　同居母子二人突然失踪　獲得綫索赴蘇拘獲四犯　主使犯孫王氏尙待緝拿</h3>
<p>本月七號、白克路北河路附近之街沿上、發現無頭無手足之女尸一叚、外用花布棉被包裏、經巡捕查見、報捕將尸騐明收殮、嗣經新閘捕房華副探長王潤和·探目陳寳忠·張發祥等、查明死者名曾梁氏、蘇州人、現年四十二歲、家住長沙路一三九弄和安坊十號、幷在蘇州廣濟橋地方會同日憲兵、拘獲案犯蘇州人王根弟·及其妻王丁氏·浦東人馬金海·江北人王阿毛等四人、迎提來滬、羈押捕房、於咋晨解送特一院刑二庭、請求羈押、以便緝拿在逃主犯孫王氏、</p>
<p>尋獲　支體</p>

<p>獲得綫索</p>
<p>此决氏之被害、其可疑之原因、恐係死者薄有積蓄的萬餘元、而孫王氏因性喜賭博、輸負頗多、既與死者同居、深知其一切狀况、乃謀財害命、查被吿王根弟係孫王氏之弟、與此案嫌疑重大、經探員詳細調查彼等之踪跡、知已由浦東逃往蘇州、遂飭眼綫跟踪赴蘇查緝、枸獲本案被吿四人、</p>
<p>棄屍　經過</p>
<p>據被吿等在捕房供認、死者係於六月一日被殺、事後由孫王氏囑彼等將尸體支解移去、首由馬金海於六月六日乘騎脚踏車投入蘇州河、手足則由王阿毛，王根弟·分別拋棄、尸身由王丁氏夫婦移出云云、繼據粵婦曾李氏投案證明、死者爲其丈夫會曙先之前妻、其所包之棉布被、係孫王氏之子國良平日所用者、</p>

<h3>怎樣研究英文　（七）</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>練習的方法就是多用、舌頭太笨要想改進、可以試用希臘演說家的辦法、口內含一個小扁圓的石子、高聲誦讀、千萬別把石子呑了、最好穿一小孔、用細索拴住、</p>
<p>至於會話書的問題、就筆者所知、只有一本可讀、原訂價只要二角五分、讀者可向大書東局去買、</p>
<p>譯</p>
<p>一·國文　從前有許多名家論翻譯的條件、　「信達雅」、這是對的、翻譯第一要達意、但達意第一條件是達」的工具－國文、文字不通暢、如何能達意、從前有許多人譯了許多書、看了叫人生氣受罪、每個句子、順讀不通、顚倒讀也是莫明其妙、這種譯文可以　作「天曉得」、因爲你我不懂、連他自己也看不懂明白、這都是國文不通順的大過、與其譯這種天曉得的東西、還不如林琴南的「拂袖而起」、倒是古雅、</p>
<p>。原文　許多譯文叫人看不懂、也是由於譯者沒有把原文看淸楚、固然英文字有時涵義很廣、很難確定正義、但譯者却不能用這話去搪塞議者、我們既不能確定正義、那是因我們英文程度不够、就不應當貿然從事翻譯、若僅以練習英文或翻譯方法爲目標、當然有很大的補益、可是自已必得先把原文讀得澈底明白、</p>
<p>三·風格　翻譯本沒有訣手、只要透澈原文、而國文父是以達意就很够了、其他最困　的一點、就是保存原作風格、譬如叫哲學家譯科學書、固然不合理、若叫不懂作者個性風格的人去譯他的作品、也是不應富、縱然達意、却把原文的美麗都失去了、所以愈有硏究的人、愈不　輕動手、要譯小說、最好把作者的小說多讀幾種、分析他的個性、體會他的風格、然後下筆、比較容易成功、與其出版後受人的批評、還不如謹愼從事爲妙、</p>
<p>以上所寫關於硏究英文的三個條件及讀寫說譯幾個小門經、都是拉雜成文、且又限於篇幅、很多漏洞、讀者原諒、最後還想起一點就是、多讀淺易的文字、多看標準作家的小說、英文自然會好起來、看的秘訣就是「瀏覽」、少管生字的閑事、（完）</p>

<h3>無知的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>朋女中有幾個醫生，談起病家來往往搖頭嘆息，感慨繫之。其原因大多是爲了病家的無知。</p>
<p>有一位精神病科的醫生說，他有二個年靑的病人，精神病態巳經十分明顯，暫時是很少解救的辦法了。他勸病人的家長不要替病人娶親，因爲這一來是一種無謂的耗費，二來這與對方的終身幸福有關，而且他們的子女，遺傳精神變態傾向的可能性是很大的，所以他勸他們千萬別讓病人結婚。</p>
<p>然而自作聰明的家長，往往不聽醫生的話，病人出院以後，就隨便找了一個女子替他結婚了。因爲有一部份人迷信「冲喜」，以爲這樣一來，精神病也許會好起來的，可是這往往造成了悲劇的結局。</p>
<p>試想與一個自顧不暇的精神病人結婚有甚麼樂趣與幸福可言呢？病人自身往往不知那是義麽一回事。這種情形的不健全的婚姻，其失敗與破裂原是意料中的事。等到家長悔不當初的時候，大錯業巳鑄成，一個無辜的女子的終身幸福，又在自私迷信，無知，與買賣式的婚姻制度下斷送了。</p>
<p>以結婚治療精神病，原是一種不科學的迷信與妄想，然而在這二十世紀的社會上，這種無知的種籽還殘存着，這實在是文明與人類的恥辱！</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>水銀變黃金</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>變水銀爲黃金，這個人類久遠的美夢，現在竟然被二十世紀的科學家把它實現了。古代的鍊金術士，或許早知道終有道樣的一天，但是他們無論如何夢想不到現代科學家用的竟是那龐大，複雜，精確，奇妙的一種機器－原子轟擊機。</p>
<p>一個原子受到原子轟擊機中發射出的高速度中子（一種比原子更小的質點）的轟擊，它就分裂爲二，變成二個不同元素的原子。這是近年來物理學界最重要的新發明，差不多任何一種元素的原子，都可以拿來分裂變化。但是把水銀轟變成黃金，還是最近美國舒爾R·Sherr和彭橋K·T·Bainbridge兩敎授首次報吿成功。</p>
<p>不過進種「人造金」產量小得非常可憐。成磅的水銀，受了中子的森擊後，肉眼看來毫無變化，我們必須把它在眞空中加熱蒸發，除去水銀，剩留下來的微是渣滓，再用化學方法分離金白等雜質，才能得到一點點看不見的純金－雖然看不見，科學家却能用精密的方法證明它的存在。</p>
<p>「人造金」還有一個特點，就是它原子的內部非常不穩定，能產生鐳一樣的放射能，而它的自身就漸漸「蛻變」成另一種比較穩定的物質。這種變化十分迅速，只要四十八分鐘的時間，它的一半量就衰亡了；再過四十八分，剩餘部份的一半量又衰亡了，這樣不到幾天全都化爲烏有，因此科學家說過這樣一句很有意味的話：「它比在人們，錢袋的金錢還要飛跑得快！</p>
<p>水銀變黃金在今日或許已經不是一件使人興奮的事了，因爲我們利用同樣的機器巳能得到比黃金更可貴，更實用的原子動力－　原子的分裂能產生五百萬倍於煤的能量。科學家現在正努力使「燃燒」原子的汽鍋，馬達，或引擎加速實現，這種硏究在燃料恐慌的德國更進行得十分積極。據最近德國「自然科學」雜誌發表的驚人消息，德國的研究家已能用特別的器械和方法分離得一克的「鉍235」（足抵幾千加侖的汽油）。這是一個超時代的成就，各國權威學者對之都取懷疑的熊度，但是原子分裂的硏究本發源於德國，工作的開始至少比其他國家要早六個月，所以我們也不能武斷這個消息絕對不可靠。</p>
<p>還有一個消息說，是德國正在用分裂原子法製造人造氦氣，這也是很可能的。氦氣是充塡飛船用的氣體，現在世界上只有美國有天然的出產。雖然在今日的戰爭中，飛船已經不復有重大的意義，但是他們這種無所不用其極的奮鬥創造精神是値得我們警惕和效法的。試問我們的研究家在那裹呢？</p>

<p>十　慈父的心</p>
<p>「三爺，你怎麽啦？開了春，今兒還是第一天下雨吧！」狗子笑着說，對於他主人的年紀並不比他大多少，而記憶力巳經這樣的薄弱，心裹當然略略有些詫異。　「我就恨他早也不下，晚也不下，偏在梅賣放學的時候下起來，而且又是下得這樣大！」秋海棠皺緊着眉毛說，視綫還是集中在天空裏，恨不得想法子馬上把雨止住。</p>
<p>「我這就去啦！」狗子一面打開雨傘，一面微笑着說。</p>
<p>秋海棠却立刻伸手把他攔住了。</p>
<p>「不，還是讓我去！姑娘沒有要皮鞋，我去可以背她。」說着，他就從狗子手裏搶過了那柄雨傘來。「你還是留在家裹吧！前天你做的拉麵她吃了很高興，今兒再給她做上一斤吧！」</p>
<p>狗子聽了，撐不住便把兩個肩膀聳了一下，掩着嘴暗暗好笑。</p>
<p>「一斤麵？看來我和你又輪不到了！」他心裏這樣想。</p>
<p>對於秋海棠的鍾愛梅寳，狗子這年來是認識得太淸楚了。別的不說，單是他們父女兩個的衣着，便是一個最顯著的證明。秋海棠自己是破襖短褲，終年不穿一件新衣；而梅寳的身上，却永遠很整齊，冬天是皮，夏天是紗，太陽晒得太旺的子，，可以戴草帽，下雨的日子可以穿皮鞋，雖然比不上城市裏的那些女孩子，但在這一個方圓不足十里的樟樹屯，巳經找不到第二個小姑娘穿戴得有這樣齊整了！（一四四）</p>

<p>英國自遭德機轟炸以後，新奇的發明層出不窮，這些發明，大多是日常的用品，用以保護或救傷者，近來倫敦市上，有一種新的眼鏡出現，鏡框遮蓋額部，當中開了兩個圓洞，以便視錢通過。圓洞上面，有兩個個圓蓋，可以提高或放下。圓蓋的當中，開了一個十字形的洞。在德機來炸的時候，戴這種「眼鏡」的人，可以把圓蓋放下，保護眼睛，便不至受彈片的炸傷，同時視綫仍可不至於受太大的阻礙，得以安然走入防空壕。</p>

<h3>雷神顯靈</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>偶閱「虞初新志」，其中有這樣　節有趣的記載：</p>
<p>「本朝順治間，福州饑，畫錦坊有賣米者，雷震死其三人，有宇大書屍上，其文曰：兴日月水　　月大查，無人識者。人題之於萬壽塔壁，夜有蛛蜘垂絲於字之中，直貫而下查九字也。詢知其人，平日果然，天誅不爽矣！」</p>
<p>語云：「民食爲天」。而販賣民食者　圖私囊之飽，把米粒抬高成珍珠，一意使平民淪爲溝中瘠：這是違背天條，遭受天殛本來是應當的事。</p>
<p>米儈作惡一定利用饑荒之年：仗藉一已的厚資，囤集無數食糧，低價進，高價出，平民斗米金換斗米，而米儈們的橫財也就是盈千累萬了。更有進者，這價値等於斗金的斗米是一種什麼米呢？徵腐的小浸的，黝黃的，碎屑的，缺少的，甚至拌着木屑泥粒敗草石子的…名目之多，一似他們棧房裏的貨色。</p>
<p>「好一點的米沒有了嗎？」升斗小民問。</p>
<p>「你買平米那裏會好？好的石金換斗米。」米商怒答。</p>
<p>「石金換斗米？」於是未餓死的也得餓死了，於是米蛀虫的橫財更積億疊兆了。平米來了，一變戲法，成爲不能吃的東西，難道可以說「加惠」？到那裏去申訴？法律是一面倒的，一批將死未死的只有無可奈何地希望雷神快顯靈。可是雷神不顯靈將怎樣。</p>

<h3>為「上海戲劇學校」進一言</h3>
<p>— 吠聲</p>
<p>上海戲劇學校全體學生，自學校當局與黃金長期訂演以來，已歷百餘决之多，而售座始終不衰，盛况概可想見。筆者震於友好中酷嗜皮簧者盛譽該校學生成績之佳，爰於日前至黃金聆歌，藉以一覘究竟。是日爲該校學生第一〇七决之公演，貼薦諸葛，大溪皇莊及全部四郎探母，諸生演來，率能循規蹈矩，恪守繩墨，殊可喜也。蓋初學能恪守繩墨，當不致入於油滑之途，果能長此操持，將來自能漸入化境，而仍不失典型之所在，若此時即求迎合聽衆，惟以賣弄是務，則其成就，必屬哦限，寄語諸生，幸勿河漢斯言。</p>
<p>大軸四郎探母，由關正明飾四郎，歷演坐宮，出關，見娘，回令諸折，一人到底，尤爲難能可貴。就其扮相淸秀，態度大方，台步摹馬氏（連良）之瀟洒，作工宗譚門之簡練，宜可以稱全材矣，惜嗓不甚高，致歌至（…叫小番…）時之戞調，未能如饗斯應，似爲美中不足！是豈筆者所欲責備求全於關生者哉？特欲進一言於學校當局耳。夫叔岩之憚於南下者，雖外間有謂其開罪某巨公之傳說，實則自紫體力，殊未許作長期排日之演出，更未許時時貼演繁種之累工戲有以致之也。試覜南下諸伶之挑大樑者，無論生旦，鮮有不以累工戲爲號召者，最近荀慧生竟以不勝繫劇而致不克終其演期，尤例之顯者也，以數十年搜勝歌壇之老伶工，猶且視爲畏途者，孰謂年未弱冠之童稚，遽能勝任愉快，而無力竭聲嘶之慮乎？諺云「頭頂石曰磨豆腐吃力不討好」，誠信然矣，故筆老之意，繁重冗長之戲，可依劇中各折，由諸生分別輪流飾演，例如首决以甲生飾前折，而以乙生飾後折，則再决演出之際，即互換甲乙之所飾，是諸生仍得有普遍演習之機會，無復側重褊向之不均，其或折數較多，演出亦不妨多於再次，果能各折每演互換飾演者，允易收鼓勵競爭上進之實效，不褊於一，不隳衆志，允不致有養成驕矜自滿之習氣，一舉數善，是在該校常局有以調整之也。</p>
<p>該校之設備如何，筆者未獲觀光，以諸生能有如斯之成續而言，度必臻於完善，惟諸生尙在童齡，其營養與健康，當與習戲等量重視，良以通常論嗓之高吭而同潤者，每謂爲秉賦特厚，秉賦云者，先天之元氣，後天之培養耳。培養後天之最好時期，當無過於童齡也。故筆者以爲諸生演出時之華美服飾（俗稱行頭）所費當不在少，若以之充作諸生營養之資，似爲較切實際，蓋徒崇尙外表，實爲今伶最大之陋習，斥之不遑，何有於養成之耶？筆者以愛護該校之深，爰有此純粹客觀善意之貢陳，倘不以　陋而俯予採納，尤貴迅予實施，前途正未可量也。</p>
<h3>續談「坤伶鬚生」</h3>
<p>— 陸景春</p>
<p>昨讀君美「談坤伶　生」文，述及天蟾之宋寳羅與卡爾登之徐東明，論唱因派別不同，未能據以定論，如言作風，徐猶勝宋焉，此實有誤，按宋寳羅非坤角鬚生，（見更正）搭演天蟾，迄已月餘，徐東明乃屬坤伶。固皆初决蒞滬也。不　對徐宋之戲皆數度寓目，東明嗓音宏亮，做工亦極老到，目今坤角鬚生人才缺乏中，尙不失可造之材耳。至於宋伶，譚劉在三派，混爲一氣，有無所不擅，無劇不能之概，姑不論其絕不純正，觀渠演全木失空斬兼唱七星燈一劇，要非溢譽，確能一飽顧曲者之戲癮</p>
<p>輓近人皆推孟小冬爲坤伶鬚生首屈一指者，以其從業叔岩造就，藝事猛進，學譽大振。考小冬初投仇月祥爲師，在十數年前隸無錫新世界游藝塲露演，此爲小冬登台之最初期。斬黃袍烏盆計轅門斬子四郎探母諸劇，尤稱拿手，當時梁溪人士，咸嘖嘖讚許，嘆爲觀止。</p>
<p>現隸黃金之張少泉與昔大世界乾坤大劇塲之陳善甫，均坤伶鬚生之雋材。善甫唱腔，　潤高爽，有石破天驚之概！惜乎非「天然脚」，故對劇中表情做工，未克展其所長；遂始終站於平庸地位，不爲人重。少泉係已故名小生李蓮芳之妻，擅鬚生劇，達百餘齣之多；唱做皆可取，有爐火純青之功！迺者，陳已息影劇壇有年，張亦配演老旦，且稍積餘資，固不僅依優孟爲生矣。</p>
<p>此外，坤伶中有一鬚生翁梅倩，藝甚不弱，曾負時譽，奈以深染嗜好，一生際遇殊潦倒，最後竟出演於小世界與神仙世界坤班中，藉以糊口，可知伊凄凉之一斑。今則梅倩已不在人間，値此坤伶鬚生凋謝兼之人才難興之秋，後起者祇張文娟仇樂弟曁徐東明輩，然此諸蛛中，予認爲東明之藝，以言做工，似在張仇兩伶之上，即唱亦極不浮，字正腔圓，饗澈有味，詎邇來卡爾登售座平平，斯殆票價每位五元太昂之所致歟？</p>
<p>名小生周維俊，爲金仲仁得意門墻，藝事精湛，能戲特多。故凡「葛巾」「黑衣」「雉尾」「髮冠」無不各盡其妙。而動作瀟洒，嗓音淸甜，尤其餘事。此决輔徐氏姊妹出隸卡爾登，更見牡丹綠葉，相得益彰，殊可喜也。</p>

<p>第十一章　英姿颯爽酣战</p>
<p>李自成恐他的愛將吃虧，指揮大隊流寇向前掩殺過來。當先的都是騎兵，長槍大戰，加以强弓毒矢，官軍抵擋不住。周遇吉和許靖只得丟了一隻虎，回馬掩護。流寇直追過來，幸張烈所率的弓箭手放出亂箭，射住流寇，周遇吉和許靖纔安然退入承中。流寇又來攻打了一番，至天晚始止。决日天下大雨，流寇祇攻了一刻時候，立即退去。但是周遇吉在城上督率部卒堅守，沒有半三兒的懈怠。他立在雨中，屹然不動，甲裳盡濕。許靖勸他稍歇。周遇吉嘆道：「危城孤撐，以少敵衆，若我不能耐勞受辛，怎樣使士卒爲我苦戰呢」？許靖也爲感動。夜間風雨不止，周遇吉在夜色迷濛中立在女牆邊，向城外流寇的大營遙望了一會，下城來對許靖設道：「今晚大雨滂沱，賊兵運日渡河攻城，未免辛苦，或將少息，其心必懈，不如我與你各率兵五百，前去刦營，或可獲勝。你少年英俟，肯隨我努力殺賊，使我很快慰的。」許靖道：「願從將軍前去效犬馬之勞。」周遇吉遂挑選一千敢死之士，在二更過後。悄悄地出城襲擊，而命張烈范成小心守城。這時風斜雨細，城外的民房早被流寇焚燒殆盡，一片敗井頹垣，沉沉如鬼壚。他們也不點燈，銜枚疾趨，一個流寇的哨兵也沒遇見。周遇吉心中暗暗歡喜。將近賊營時，遙望尙有一二燈火亮着，周遇吉遂和許靖各從左右殺人，突然亮起火把，擂着戰鼓，一千兵士，騎兵在前，步卒在後，個個人奮勇爭先，直殺入流寇營中去。周遇吉一枝槍只顧橫挑直刺，不知被他搠死了多少賊兵，掃去了很多鹿角，踏至中營。流寇都從睡夢中驚醒，馬不及鞍，人不及甲，紛紛逃竄，頓時大亂。（一〇一）</p>

<h3>Soviet-German Battle on the Minsk Front: Mechanized Forces Clash Fiercely; Stalin's Eagles Strike Romanian Oilfields; Nazi Paratroopers Landing in Soviet Territory Annihilated</h3>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 27th - The Soviet Information Bureau released the latest battle report as follows: "On the 26th, in the direction of Minsk (Note: Minsk is located in Belarus, on the Polish border, and is an important transportation hub), our troops bravely resisted the invading enemy tank forces. In the fierce fighting, in the Rusk direction, tank forces of both sides engaged in large-scale intense warfare all day, with our side clearly gaining the upper hand. (2) In the area of Jenowitz (Czernowitz), the enemy attempted to forcibly cross the Prut River but was repelled. (3) On the Bessarabian front, our troops firmly defended the national defense line, repelling the German-Romanian allied forces. The enemy, attempting to advance to Skuleni, suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat to the west bank of the Prut River. (4) Our air force bombed the Romanian capital, Bucharest, and Constanta (a Romanian Black Sea port). The Ploiești oil refineries caught fire. (5) There were no conflicts on the Soviet-Finnish border on the 26th. (6) In the Baltic Sea area, our air force sank two enemy submarines. (7) On the 26th, there was no significant special activity by enemy aircraft. Enemy aircraft did not put up strong resistance to our air force's attacks. Information on enemy aircraft losses is being collected."</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th - The Eastern European war continued fiercely all day yesterday along the entire line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Both sides mobilized unprecedentedly large manpower and material resources for combat. The German side desperately attempted to break through the Soviet line and invade the Soviet mainland, while the Soviet side was determined to contain the enemy's advance. A characteristic of yesterday's fighting seemed to be the intensified activity of the Soviet Air Force. According to the latest Moscow communique, Soviet aircraft attacked Bucharest and Ploiești, with bombs raining down. Refineries in the oilfields caught fire. The National Broadcasting Company's correspondent in Ankara broadcast this morning that as a result of the Soviet Air Force's bombing, the Romanian government had left Bucharest. The Soviet side also claimed that German tanks attempting to break through Soviet positions in the Rusk area and along the Bessarabian border had been repelled. At the same time, German officials stated that the war was proceeding according to plan, but admitted that the Soviet forces were putting up strong resistance. Pro-Axis Hungary widely circulated reports that German forces had occupied Lviv in the Galicia region, but this has not been confirmed by other sources. The German official news agency said that a German infantry regiment, with the assistance of light artillery and elite troops, had captured a Soviet airfield. Before the German forces launched their final attack, 28 warplanes at the airfield were destroyed by artillery fire. The flames spread to hangars and barracks, and equipment and weapons at the airfield were also seized.</p>
<p>Berlin, United Press, 20th - The German High Command issued a communique from the Führer's headquarters stating that the Red Army's resistance was slightly slowing, and that German forces had won victories everywhere, and that all sorts of important decisions will soon be announced. The operations in the east in the previous five days have already proven that the Soviet troops were "preparing to attack Central Europe." In the salient along the border west of Lviv and Brest-Litovsk (a place very vulnerable to German flanking attacks), German forces have engaged a large number of Soviet troops in combat. Information indicates that the initial clashes between German and Soviet forces took place near the border, and the results will be announced soon. Berlin, Havas, 27th - A German fighter squadron, renowned for its bravery in combat, discovered an enemy tank column hidden in the woods beside the main road, apparently intending to attack the German vanguard. They unexpectedly made a swift low-altitude bombing run, destroying 46 of the 70 Soviet tanks. Seeing the enemy tank column in disarray and routed, the German forces launched a major offensive. German tanks charged into the enemy's rear. The remaining Soviet tank column was attempting to regroup in a small village to offer resistance, but German aircraft arrived again, bombing fiercely. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communique stating that in several areas of the Belorussian front, enemy soldiers disguised in Red Army uniforms were detected. However, the Red Army was vigilant and saw through their trickery. These enemy soldiers were subsequently destroyed or captured. Enemy paratroopers, in groups of four to six, landed in several locations in Belorussia with the aim of carrying out intelligence work. They were all captured and handed over to the military authorities. These paratroopers were carrying wireless radios. However, the enemy's attempts to use paratroopers were met with extremely strict countermeasures. Enemy paratroopers attempted to land in a certain area of Ukraine, but were all annihilated by nearby Red Army cavalry units.</p>
<h3>Hungary Declares War on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Budapest, Havas, 17th - An official Hungarian statement said that Hungary, in view of the repeated violations of international law by Soviet aircraft in bombing Hungarian territory, considers itself at war with the Soviet Union from 1:20 AM this morning. Another official statement said that the Soviet air force bombed Kassa yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, killing five civilians and wounding several. At 5:30 PM yesterday evening, Red aircraft attempted to invade again but were repelled by Hungarian anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>Rome, Reuters, 27th - The Italian official news agency reported that a huge explosion occurred in Hungary this morning, shaking Budapest. The location was the Naplteped military ammunition depot a few miles from Budapest. It is reported that the military authorities will investigate the cause of the explosion.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th - According to Moscow wireless reports, Nazi paratroopers carrying pistols, trade union blank papers, and typewriters were arrested at a certain railway station near the front lines. They were arrested by railway station staff and firefighters from a collective farm, and were reportedly wearing Soviet militia uniforms.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern European War: Soviet and German Strengths are Comparable</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th - According to reliable sources in Washington, the Soviet Union has two-thirds the number of aircraft as Germany, but twice the number of tanks. The Soviet Union has a total of 48 tank brigades, equivalent to 24 divisions. The German side has only 12 armored divisions. At the start of the war, the Soviet Union had 4,000 aircraft on the front lines, while the Germans had 6,000. It is widely believed that 5 million vehicles are operating on land in this great war. The Soviet and German numbers are comparable. The German army has 176 divisions (15,000 soldiers per division), while the Soviet Union has 165 divisions (excluding the Far Eastern Red Army). The distribution is as follows: 23 divisions east of Finland, 42 divisions to the south, 12 divisions to the southeast, 14 divisions in the center of the Polish front, 48 divisions south of Ukraine, and 16 or more divisions in reserve.</p>
<p>German Strategy in the Attack on the Soviet Union: A Four-Pronged Advance</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th - The Reuters military correspondent writes that although the German attack on the Soviet Union has been underway for less than a week, and there is little news besides official reports, it is possible to discern some aspects of the German advance. Based on available information and terrain, it is expected that the Germans, in addition to advancing from Finland through the Karelian Isthmus to threaten Leningrad, will advance along four lines east of the Baltic Sea. Currently, the two main thrusts are developing through the Baltic states and northern Poland. The former has Leningrad as its main objective, and the latter has Moscow as its main objective. The other two thrusts are expected to aim at Kyiv and Odesa. The Germans have already begun operations along these four lines of advance. The German forces advancing along the Baltic Sea route will find that the flat farmland there is well-suited for mechanized divisions to operate in, but the poor roads will not be able to bear heavy loads. It is believed that the main target of this route will be Pskov, and then the final destination of Leningrad. At the same time, another German force may flank from the southeast. Fierce fighting has already broken out in the areas of Kaunas and Vilnius. The Soviet forces in this area may wish to retreat slightly, as the Soviets have built a strong defensive line along the Daugava River (on the old Soviet-Estonian and Soviet-Latvian borders). It is expected that the Soviets will put up very strong resistance when the German forces reach that line. The second line of advance that the German forces have begun to pursue is south of the famous Pripyat Marshes, through the Baranovichi Gap, aiming at Smolensk and Moscow. This is the same route that Napoleon followed in his invasion of Russia. The terrain there, as far south as Brest-Litovsk, is also suitable for large-scale battles and mechanized vehicle activity. Due to the Pripyat Marshes, the German forces cannot launch a large-scale offensive until they reach the point near Sokal where the Bug River and the border diverge. The route from that point southwest through Przemyśl to the San River, hundreds of miles long, appears to be a dangerous area for the Soviets, as there is no natural defensive line. The Soviet aim is to occupy Lviv (also known as Lemberg) and threaten Kyiv, or even to divide their forces and advance to the southwest. Although this is clearly a German line of advance, the Soviets are currently entrenched in Przemyśl, and there has been no major development. The fourth line of advance may be to attack into southern Ukraine along the Prut River and the Dniester River, threatening Odesa. However, the attacks by the German-Romanian forces along this line appear to have been stalled. To the north of this line, the Carpathian Mountains stretch, and the Soviets are unlikely to use large forces in that difficult mountainous terrain. Northern Bukovina is also mostly forested and hardly suitable for large-scale military operations. However, if the weather is clear, Bessarabia is conducive to combat. The Soviets must be vigilant against a German attack across the Dniester River from northern Bessarabia, as a successful German advance along this line would cut off the communications of the Soviet forces operating in the northwest. However, the Dniester River can only be forded after July. The only bridge is near Tiraspol in central Bessarabia.</p>
<p>Fierce German Offensives Along the Baltic Coast</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas, 26th - According to the latest news, the German offensive in the Baltic states is gaining strength. The situation on the front lines is summarized as follows: (1) In Latvia, German forces have occupied Liepāja (this is the Soviet Union's closest air force base to East Prussia) and Jelgava. It is rumored that the capital Riga is also in German hands, but this has not been officially confirmed. In addition, the Soviet military base of Ventspils in western Latvia is still in Red Army hands, but whether the Red Army troops stationed there will be able to withdraw in the future is questionable. (2) In Poland, the city of Vilnius in the north has been occupied by German forces. German motorized units are attacking fiercely along the line of Lida and Pruzhany. German forces departing from the province of Galicia are attacking Soviet positions in the San River basin. Forces of both sides are engaged in day-long combat around the city of Przemyśl, which is currently still in fierce fighting. In Lviv (Lemberg), German forces are advancing along two routes. Most of the population has been evacuated, but the authorities are still calling on the people to maintain order.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Business and Industrial Sectors Should Protect Their Southeast Asian Trade</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been reports that the export of Shanghai-made products to Southeast Asia is flourishing again. This is also affected by the expansion of the European war. The needs of various places in Southeast Asia have no choice but to turn to Shanghai for supply. However, what Shanghai can supply is far from comparable to the time when the European war first broke out. At that time, China's industry was not as developed as it is now, and the circulation of Chinese products was free and smooth, with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of all parties. Today, domestic freight is being blocked at every turn, and the prices of all goods are high. Externally, there is a shortage of ships, freight rates are soaring, and there is a risk that the war will spread to the entire globe. The position of various factories is therefore very different from what it was before. In the past, there was more than enough cotton and wheat for self-sufficiency, so the textile and flour milling industries all developed extraordinarily. Now, however, all the raw materials for various factories must be sought from abroad. Once something happens overseas and the supply of raw materials is interrupted, they will inevitably have to suspend operations and wait. The silk weaving industry claims that its business is developing, but if one asks about its raw materials, it is like a beggar asking for leftovers. If one asks about the large batches of dyed woven fabrics, how many of them are truly funded, owned, and woven by Chinese? Who can avoid resorting to fraudulent methods of changing labels and deceiving themselves and others? The facts are there, and there is no need to shy away from them. It is only a source of heartache to talk about them.</p>
<p>However, at this time of development along the route to Southeast Asia, I cannot bear to remain silent. The overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are deeply concerned about their motherland and are zealous in their love and care. They spare no effort in promoting the sale of domestic goods. Their spirit of struggle and endeavor is one that anyone with a conscience cannot help but admire. We should assist them, connect with them, offer them preferential treatment, and provide them with convenience in order to develop the position of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, to promote the sale of Chinese products, and to maintain the strength of our people who have been operating overseas on their own initiative since the Song and Yuan dynasties. This is a shared responsibility of all Chinese people. However, what I have seen and heard is very different from this. Although I do not mean to say that this is the case for all in the business and industrial sectors, it is an ingrained habit, and people are treacherous. There is a danger of making those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice. It has been said that when the sales of Shanghai products are sluggish, they try their best to promote them to Southeast Asia. When the Shanghai market turns around, they think of selling them locally. Some have even been known to raise the prices of the same orders from Southeast Asia, or refuse to take them on, or fail to deliver on time, causing overseas Chinese businessmen to make fruitless trips back and forth and miss opportunities. This gives people the unpleasant impression of being important when there is something to be done, and unimportant when there is nothing to be done. Furthermore, the samples often do not match the goods delivered. There are cases of skimping on labor and materials, with a mixture of high and low quality. There are cases of mismatched colors and patterns, and cases of incorrect widths. They disregard integrity and do not plan for the long term, but only think of the base psychology of near-term profits. In the business and industrial sectors, where there are all sorts of characters, one cannot be certain that this is not happening. The sales of a product in a certain place must conform to the local customs, culture, climate, and preferences. Chinese business and industrial sectors often have little knowledge of this principle. They only know how to close their doors and build a cart, and then expect it to fit the ruts when they go out. In an era of no competition, there is still a risk of decline. How much more so in today's era of fierce commercial warfare? How can they not be eliminated? Furthermore, the political and economic conditions of a certain place, such as the level of tariffs on goods and the location of market power, all have a relationship with the cost and breadth of sales of a product. There are often differences of a few yuan in the value of a few counts of yarn, and the taxes levied are vastly different. Therefore, it is necessary to first conduct on-the-ground investigations, and constantly examine the situation, ensuring that everything conforms to reality and that there are no unexpected losses, and providing convenience to the distributors. Then, the orders will inevitably come flocking in. Once a commodity has been sold by a distributor, one should respect the distributor's wishes. If the distributor believes that the style should be like this, and the quality should be like that, then one should manufacture it according to their preferences. If this is not possible, then one should only do one's best to meet the distributor's desires. Even if the sample has been set, but it is deemed necessary to make modifications on a temporary basis, one should make corrections within the possible scope. In addition, the high exchange rate, the reform of government policies, the changes in the situation, and the changes in the weather all have an impact that is closely related to commercial and industrial enterprises. How can one, in this complex era, still think of using simple brains and base psychology to cope and maintain? Heading south while wanting to go north, the failure of oneself is not a pity, but it also affects the national economy and the people's livelihood, which is hateful!</p>
<p>In China's foreign trade, everything is inferior to others. Transportation depends on others, intermediary buying and selling depends on others, and financial exchange depends on others. How many can do it directly? Fortunately, the only ones who have a slight foothold are our hard-working and enduring overseas Chinese businessmen. In the beginning, most of them were driven by hunger and cold and could not find a place for themselves in their motherland. So they went to Southeast Asia, relying on the strength of their own hands and feet, and the diligence and thrift of their savings. Although they have been repeatedly oppressed by powerful and protective nations, they still do not lose their underlying strength. This is precisely because our nation's excellent virtues are manifested and magnified in times of hardship, difficulty, danger, and destruction, enabling them to survive and thrive independently in the world. How can the business and industrial sectors in Shanghai not work even harder, uniting with the overseas Chinese both internally and externally, with sincerity and trustworthiness, to maintain a strong connection? How can they erect barriers themselves, giving others the opportunity to exploit the situation and steal benefits invisibly?</p>
<p>Romanian Troops Forced into Battle: River Crossing Ultimately Unsuccessful</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communique stating that captured Romanian soldiers said that there were 40 German officers and soldiers in each Romanian regiment to monitor them, because the German command did not trust the Romanian soldiers. German artillery units were placed behind the Romanian troops, forcing the Romanian soldiers to fight, as the Romanian soldiers opposed the war and opposed the Soviets. A military target in the Romanian city of Jassy was the target of our army's attack. The destruction after the bombing was significant. Comrade Manchin, commander of an artillery division, assisted the infantry in repelling the enemy troops who were forcibly crossing the Prut River in a certain area. Manchin selected an observation point and discovered the weakest point of the enemy's forces. As soon as the enemy began to cross the river, he opened fire and bombarded them fiercely, destroying three enemy pontoon bridges and damaging six enemy guns. The enemy forces suffered losses and were unable to cross the river into Soviet territory.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Hungarian-Romanian border, Havas, 26th - The news of the fighting at the front received here today is very scarce. The authorities in Bucharest are trying to avoid leaking military information about the Prut River and Bukovina areas. It is reported that the Romanian troops commanded by General Antonescu and the German troops commanded by General List are continuing to advance and will soon reach the west bank of the Dniester River, which is the boundary between the province of Bessarabia and the Soviet mainland. Crossing this river will not be easy, as the Soviets have built strong fortifications on the east bank. In terms of terrain, the situation is relatively favorable for the German-Romanian forces, as the west bank is 300 feet higher than the plain on the east bank, allowing the German-Romanian allied forces to occupy the high ground. The port of Odesa is 25 miles east of this river. Some of the Soviet ships currently docked at the port have already sailed away, which proves that the Soviets are already aware of the danger to the port. Today, the Soviets dispatched 400 aircraft, conducting large-scale bombing raids on various parts of Romania. The cities bombed included Constanta, Tulcea, Galați, Jassy, and Sulina.</p>
<p>Finland Drawn into the Vortex: Fighting Breaks Out in Northern Finland</p>
<p>Helsinki, Havas, 26th - According to official news from here, after Finland declared a state of war between the Soviet Union and Finland, German forces immediately launched an offensive in the area of Salla in northeastern Finland (Note: Salla is the end point of the railway from Murmansk in northern Russia to Finland, which was annexed by the Soviet Union during the Soviet-Finnish War in 1939). The air forces of both sides are also taking joint action with the army. The Soviet Air Force has bombed southeastern Finland, especially the port of Kotka. Helsinki, United Press, 27th - Yesterday it was officially announced here that 38 Soviet aircraft in three groups raided the Finnish port of Turku on Wednesday. It is reported that the working-class district outside the city suffered losses, with bombs and incendiary bombs raining down, killing several people and wounding 27.</p>
<p>Stockholm, United Press, 27th - News from Helsinki obtained by newspapers here states that loud artillery fire was heard in Helsinki yesterday afternoon from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The artillery fire came from the south and is believed to be an engagement between the Soviet Navy and the Finnish Army.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas, 16th - Military observers here recently stated that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Finnish army, under the command of General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, has deployed troops along the border in the Karelian Isthmus and sealed off the Karelian Straits between the Baltic Sea and Lake Ladoga. However, this front does not include the Vyborg Fortress. They have only deployed outposts on the left bank of Lake Ladoga, while concentrating their forces in the north in order to launch a mobile war. The German objective is to attack the Soviet port of Kandalaksha on the White Sea coast. The Red Army in Lithuania and Latvia has shifted its positions, withdrawing to the Daugava River, and has begun a counter-offensive with motorized units. In terms of naval warfare, the Soviet fleet is very wary of German submarines and has not sailed to the eastern waters of the Gulf of Finland. According to German naval strategy, the aim is to lock the Soviet fleet inside the Baltic Sea, preventing it from operating in all directions. There are a total of 60 to 65 Soviet submarines in the Baltic Sea, but there is no news of their activities. One of their bases is in Kronstadt, and the other is in the Gulf of Riga.</p>
<p>Nazi Air Force Active: Leningrad Suffers Frenzied Bombing</p>
<p>Berlin, United Press, 27th - The German official news agency announced that the German side has carried out "extremely intense" air raids on Leningrad in the past two days. Major metal factories, shipyards, the largest Soviet aircraft factory, and other explosives factories have been bombed (Note: Leningrad has become one of the Soviet Union's leading wartime industrial centers because of these factories). German and Finnish aircraft are also constantly bombing Soviet ports, railways, highways, supplies, and transport links north of the Black Sea, and Soviet troops being reinforced to the front are being attacked.</p>
<p>Moscow, United Press, 27th - Izvestia reported that there was an air raid alert in Leningrad yesterday, but no aircraft came.</p>

<h3>Japan's Economic Difficulties Due to German-Soviet War; US Reduces Raw Material Supply to Japan; German Machine Exports to Japan Also Sharply Decline</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7 (United Press) - Due to Germany's declaration of war against the Soviet Union, Japan has encountered unprecedented economic difficulties. The outbreak of the German-Soviet war has effectively isolated the Japanese economy from Europe and created new difficulties in sourcing raw materials. The "Asahi Shimbun" reports that financial leaders are advising the government to completely re-examine the recently drafted plan to place Japan in a "national defense posture." The newspaper states that the German-Soviet war has rendered the original procedures of the national defense posture impractical in some respects. The report says that even before the German-Soviet war, a shortage of raw materials in Japan had already forced some factories to close or reduce production. Financial circles here expect that the new economic problems currently facing Japan will result in the government further tightening control over industry and restricting raw materials. Japanese business leaders point out that the United States has reduced its exports of key raw materials in recent weeks and anticipate that the United States will further reduce its exports to Japan, shifting its raw material supply to the Soviet Union. Imports of machinery from Germany to Japan have also sharply declined since the outbreak of the European war. Some machinery was transported to Japan via the Siberian Railway, but Japan is now completely isolated from Germany. Japanese industrialists advocate improving domestic economic procedures and focusing on industries supplied with raw materials from the Far East. Some observers believe that this objective will ultimately lead Japan to reopen business negotiations with the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7 (United Press) - The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated today that the Tripartite Pact and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact cannot coexist due to the German-Soviet war. French reports say, "If we wait for future developments, we will lose either or even both of these pacts simultaneously." It also stated that if the United States continues not to adopt a neutrality policy towards the German-Soviet war or dispatches any American troops to land in Vladivostok to aid the Soviet Union, even in small numbers, it will "take a step to further strain the already fragile US-Japan relations."</p>
<p>American Newspapers Acknowledge Japan's Difficult Situation</p>
<p>New York, July 7 (Reuters) - The New York Times' Tokyo correspondent commented on the German-Soviet war, saying that Japanese calculations were contrary to the facts. Japan is now facing a very serious situation politically and economically. Japan now deeply understands that Germany must defeat the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in order to achieve victory. Even the most ardent supporters of the Axis powers feel unsure. If Germany is defeated or cannot achieve a decisive victory, Japan cannot expect to benefit from the Tripartite Alliance. Some Japanese now fear that Japan may follow Italy's path. Newspapers have implicitly indicated the failure of Japanese policy. The St. Louis Democratic Globe-Democrat stated that Hitler's war on the new front has opened a new chapter in the current war. This can be seen as Hitler acknowledging that he cannot conquer Britain. The German-Soviet war will likely be prolonged. Both Britain and the United States can be excited about this, as time is now their most valuable asset. The Los Angeles Times also stated that the German-Soviet war is temporally beneficial to Britain and the United States, and the transfer of the German Air Force to the Eastern Front makes it easier for the British Air Force to succeed. The New York Daily Labor stated that Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union is tantamount to attacking the German people and taking the greatest risk. The Soviet government's struggle is not only to defend the land of socialism but also to defend the most important interests of people in all countries. This is an upright struggle for the freedom of all countries and their people. The Washington Post stated that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is indeed an admission of its own failure. When France collapsed a year ago, Hitler believed that he could achieve final victory, but it is still far from being realized. Britain cannot be conquered after all. Although Germany has continental Europe to exploit, its resources are not as thick as those supplied by the United States to Britain.</p>
<p>Japan Extremely Concerned About US Aid to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 27 (Reuters) - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii, when meeting with reporters this morning, was asked whether Japan opposes American aid to the Soviet Union. Ishii replied, "We will wait and see." He also stated that if the rumors of American aid to the Soviet Union are realized, it will put Japan in a troublesome and difficult position. Therefore, Japan is currently watching the overall situation with extreme concern. The spokesman then commented on rumors of an imminent reorganization of the Konoe Cabinet, calling them foolish rumors. The spokesman then addressed reports that the British Ambassador to China visited Hong Kong on June 22 and mentioned that Britain, the United States, and the Chongqing government had concluded a military alliance, saying that he had received this information but it had not been officially confirmed. It is reported that the British Ambassador announced this alliance to a group of leaders in the Chinese cultural community. Japan is currently investigating this matter. When asked whether the Soviet-Japanese Commercial Treaty conflicts with the Tripartite Pact, Ishii replied, "No, the commercial treaties have been approved, and we will faithfully abide by them. However, the approval date has not yet been determined." Finally, he addressed the issue of the Dutch East Indies, telling reporters that there are no new developments in the negotiations between both parties. The reaction of the Dutch East Indies to the new European war is still unclear. The Japanese Consul General in Batavia has repeatedly explained to the Dutch authorities that the rubber and oil purchased by Japan will not be transported to Germany via Arabia.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military and Government Leaders Continue Discussions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 27 (Reuters) - The government and the Supreme Command of National Defense held an emergency meeting again this afternoon at the Prime Minister's residence to discuss important issues currently facing Japan. Representatives from the government included Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Interior Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Oikawa. Representatives from the Supreme Command included Army Chief of Staff Sugiyama and Navy Chief of Staff Nagano.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Japan Visits Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7 (Reuters) - German Ambassador Ott visited Foreign Minister Matsuoka's private residence at 9:00 this morning and stayed for an hour. The nature of the conversation has not been disclosed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Germany Visits German Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 27 (Reuters) - According to a report from Berlin, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Lieutenant General Oshima met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at his mountain villa in Fuschl am See yesterday to discuss various matters related to the German-Soviet war for over ninety minutes.</p>
<h3>Yoshizawa Returns to Japan</h3>
<p>Batavia, July 7 (Reuters) - Yoshizawa and eight members of the Japanese trade delegation, after a harmonious farewell with Dutch East Indies Economic Minister Van Mook and Commerce Minister Hoogstraten, returned to Japan this morning aboard the Nyssho Maru. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, who had just inspected Java, sent his adjutant as a representative to see them off. Japanese Consul General Ishii and prominent Japanese residents here gathered in Tanjung Priok to bid them farewell.</p>
<h3>US Interior Secretary Calls for Immediate War with Germany; This is a Golden Opportunity for the United States; Also Denounces Lindbergh as a Lackey of Germany</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 27 (Reuters) - Two days ago, western Japan, including Kyushu, was hit by heavy rain. There were many deaths and injuries, and material damage was great. In Fukuoka Prefecture, 15 people died, 16 were missing, 20,000 houses were flooded, and 33 were destroyed. In Saga Prefecture, 16 people died, 2 were seriously injured, 10,000 houses were flooded, and 3 were destroyed. A coal mine was also flooded, killing 11 miners. Railway traffic in Kyushu has been interrupted.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials from Vietnam to Germany Obstructed by War</h3>
<p>Singapore, July 7 (United Press) - According to informed sources, Saigon's wharves are currently piled high with rubber, tin, and other raw materials. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Japanese purchasing committee has been unwilling to accept the goods. It is reported that Urda, the head of the German Economic Commission to Japan, purchased 15,000 tons of rubber from Vietnam, which is currently being stored by Reiss &amp; Co. in Shanghai, awaiting shipment to Germany.</p>
<p>Hartford, July 27 (United Press) - Interior Secretary Ickes last night directly called on the United States to arm itself to deal with Germany, while also denouncing Colonel Lindbergh as a lackey of Hitler and as America's "Quisling." In effect, Ickes demanded that the United States take advantage of Germany's involvement in the war against the Soviet Union to join the war, as this is a golden opportunity that will not come again easily. Ickes said, "We must now make the best choice. We have delayed too long. We must sacrifice in war and be willing to cast away life to gain the freedom exemplified by Washington, Lincoln, and Churchill." Ickes denounced Lindbergh and his followers as "Nazi wolves in the clothing of appeasement." He said that the United States should share its resources and tears, like the brave British under Churchill's leadership. Hitler has already drafted a list of countries to be destroyed, and the United States will follow in their footsteps. We should do our best to help Britain to destroy Hitler and his party. If the United States does not give full support to Britain as soon as possible, it will find itself in danger of fighting alone. The Interior Secretary then shifted the topic to Lindbergh, saying that if Lindbergh still favors Hitler at this time (and everything he says and does indicates this), it is either because he has reached an understanding with Hitler through collusion or because he hopes to win Hitler's favor. "Lindbergh's political behavior is, of course, unacceptable to free people." Regarding the German-Soviet war, Ickes said, "The Soviet Union is obviously weaker than Germany. We must help it to consume a large amount of German manpower and material resources. The United States cannot accept either Nazism or Communism, but the longer the Soviet Union resists Germany, the more the democracies will benefit."</p>
<h3>Germans Returning Home Via Soviet Union Captured by Soviets</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 17 (Reuters) - According to Japanese sources, Dr. Basil, President of the East Asia Association (a cultural organization initiated by the Nazis with its headquarters in Tokyo) and Secretary of the German Chamber of Commerce in Japan, was returning to Germany via the Siberian Railway when the German-Soviet war broke out. It is believed that he has been captured by the Soviet authorities. Basil departed from Manzhouli on June 16 and was one day's journey from Moscow when the war broke out. Thielschuk, the representative in Japan of the Koppers factory, which manufactures oil refining equipment in Essen, Germany, and his wife and daughter, were also on the same train and are also feared to be among those arrested. In addition, 40 Germans were returning home via the Soviet Union from the United States and South America when the war broke out. It is believed that Dr. Stettfeldt, a famous German ear, nose, and throat specialist, was fortunate to have fallen ill suddenly at the Manchurian border and was unable to return on that train leaving Manzhouli on June 16.</p>
<h3>British Forces Continue Bombing Various Parts of Germany</h3>
<p>London, July 27 (Reuters) - The British Air Force last night bombed targets in western and northwestern Germany for the 16th consecutive night. Key industrial centers in the Ruhr region, including Cologne and Düsseldorf, as well as the bases of Bremen, Kiel, and Wilhelmshaven, were heavily bombed. Targets in the occupied territories were also attacked. During the day yesterday, British fighters and bombers flew over northern France again to carry out attacks, which were quite successful. According to the Air Ministry, only a very few German aircraft flew over the British coast last night, in East Anglia and certain locations in southeastern England, dropping bombs, but the damage was minor, and there were no reports of casualties.</p>

<h3>New Foreign Minister Quo Tai-chi Arrives in Chongqing Yesterday; Immediately Meets with Chiang Kai-shek to Discuss the Latest Situation; Wang Chung-hui Hosts a Banquet in the Evening</h3>
<p>Chongqing - New Foreign Minister Quo Tai-chi arrived in Chongqing at 5:15 PM on the 27th, flying from Yunnan on a CNAC plane. Quo Tai-fu and Hsieh Jin-lin came with him. Belgian Ambassador Nieuwmans, British Ambassador Kerr, Wu Tieh-cheng, He Yao-zu, Wang Shih-chieh, Wang Chung-hui, Hsu Mo, Chuan Bing-chang, Yu Hung-chun, Peng Hsueh-pei, Chu Chia-hua, Wu Kuo-chen, Hsiao Tung-tzu, and representatives of H.H. Kung, Ho Ying-chin, Pai Chung-hsi, and senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Chinese and foreign reporters, totaling 200 people, welcomed him at the airport. After Quo alighted from the plane and spoke briefly with the British Ambassador, Wu Tieh-cheng and He Yao-zu, he met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the airport lounge. Quo said that the only international news he learned en route from Lashio was the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. This extremely important event has clarified the international situation. China is at the forefront of resisting aggression, and we are willing to cooperate with all those who are in the same situation as us. A very strong anti-Axis group has now been formed to confront the Axis powers. Quo continued that his stay in the United States was very pleasant. He took the opportunity to contact leaders in the United States, both in and out of government, and visited his family in Arizona. In Washington, he received gracious treatment from President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and other government leaders. He found the Pacific flight very comfortable, and along the way, he met with local authorities and was able to visit the defense projects in Honolulu, Singapore, and Rangoon. The local authorities gave him extremely friendly treatment. After arriving in Lashio, he changed to a car to go to Kunming to inspect the conditions along the Yunnan-Burma Road. This was the only car ride on my journey. The Yunnan-Burma Road is China's lifeline and a symbol of cooperation between the ABC (America, Britain, China) powers. Before I take office, it is worth a visit. Quo concluded that after arriving in Chongqing, he would first visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report and receive instructions, and to discuss the recent situation, etc. Quo was wearing a gray suit and looked energetic, no different from when he left the country nine years ago, and did not look like he had traveled a long distance. Reporters took many photos. After talking with the reporters, Quo left the airport for his residence. Wang Chung-hui hosted a banquet for Quo and Chin-lin at the Foreign Affairs Guesthouse in the evening, attended by senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chuan Bing-chang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan. (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Kunming - The new Foreign Minister Quo Tai-chi arrived here on the 24th via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Provincial Chairman Long Yun, Supervising Commissioner Li Gen-yuan, the heads of various departments, Special Commissioner Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Quo Tai-fu and others, numbering over a hundred, all greeted him in the suburbs. In the evening, Chairman Long and others hosted a welcoming banquet. This afternoon, reporters called on Quo at his residence. Quo traveled all the way from England, passing through the United States and Southeast Asia, covering tens of thousands of miles. He also inspected the Yunnan-Burma Road, traveling by car for many days. En route, due to mountain floods washing away the road surface, he walked several tens of miles, enduring extreme hardship. Quo's temples were already gray, but after a long journey, he was still energetic and answered reporters' questions with a friendly smile. Quo first said that he had passed through the Pacific islands of the United States and Southeast Asia, and had been able to meet and interact frankly with President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, President Quezon, and military and political authorities in various places, which he found very pleasant. When he passed through Singapore, he visited the local defenses and saw that the strength of the sea, land, and air forces was very strong, sufficient to resist any aggression. When the reporter asked about the recent international situation, Quo said with a smile that the recent international situation, such as the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, and other developments, were all beneficial to China. He often mentioned that cooperation between the ABC group has been strengthened day by day, and all parties can do their utmost to help China to the highest degree. Therefore, in my view, the future of resistance and reconstruction is very optimistic. The reporter then asked about his impressions of inspecting the Yunnan-Burma Road. Quo said that all aspects of the world pay no less attention to the Yunnan-Burma Road than to the Atlantic Ocean, and the Yunnan-Burma Road is China's only international channel. During this trip, I saw that all aspects were very good, but there were still many areas that needed improvement, and I sincerely hope that improvements can be made gradually in the future.

<h3>National Financial Conference Declaration (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>(1) Establish an autonomous financial system; counties as local autonomous units, subdivided into townships, villages, and pao-chia (neighborhood units); in general, this is an autonomous organization system, and also a basic-level political structure. In the past, county-level finances were merely appendages of provincial finances, lacking significant independent sources of tax revenue. Moreover, excessive tasks assigned by higher-level governments led to increasing financial difficulties, resulting in endless instances of arbitrary levies and local fundraising. The revenue and expenditure system law promulgated in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) but never implemented, and the outline of county-level organizations promulgated in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), were both preliminary steps towards establishing an autonomous financial system. This conference discussed various proposals related to autonomous finances and made many resolutions. The main ones are listed below: (1) Streamlining county revenues to consolidate the county's financial foundation. The advocacy of local autonomy has been going on for years, but without success. The main reason is that county and township finances lack a foundation, leading to various measures that are merely stipulated but never implemented. Now, as county administration is being promoted to advance local autonomy, finance is indispensable for all major local initiatives in education, cultivation, sanitation, and defense. In addition to what has already been stipulated in the Outline of County-level Organizations, this conference also decided that the central government should allocate 30% of stamp tax revenue and 25% of inheritance tax revenue to counties. The supplementary allocation of business tax revenue should be increased from the original 20% or more to 30% or more. It had already been clearly ordered that all stamp tax revenue should go to the counties, but in the past, provinces retained a significant portion. Hereafter, it is decided that all of it will be allocated as county tax revenue. It is also stipulated that counties may implement business license taxes and taxes on the regulation of the use of licenses to create new sources of tax revenue. (2) Adjusting the revenues of impoverished counties to facilitate the universal implementation of the new county system. The balanced development of local enterprises is a prerequisite for building a modern nation. In the future, the implementation of the new county system to strengthen basic-level local organizations will increase expenditures by a factor of one or several. Affluent counties will be able to afford this, but impoverished counties may find it difficult to raise even the minimum administrative expenses required. The method of adjustment should be handled according to the following two principles: (A) After the central government takes over the land tax, it should actively reorganize it and use a portion to subsidize counties with insufficient funding. (B) Counties with sparse populations, barren land, and impoverished people have special circumstances. The amount of funding they need that they cannot raise should be subsidized by the national treasury. (3) Establishing an autonomous financial system to increase efficiency. Now that an autonomous financial system has been established, the question is how to make it sound. The financial foundation should be re-established according to the principles that have been adopted, in three points: (1) The budget system should be based on the county's general budget. All township budgets should be subordinate to the county budget, and townships with unbalanced revenues and expenditures should be subsidized by the county in a coordinated manner. (2) For counties with unbalanced revenues and expenditures, a taxation agency established by the central government should maintain subsidies on their behalf. (3) Fiscal administration should continue to use the auditing system. If this is faithfully implemented, public finance will certainly be brought onto the right track, and long-standing malpractices will not be difficult to eliminate. This is an essential plan for improving tax administration, the tax system, and government revenue and expenditure. Among the improvement proposals passed by this conference, the most important ones are listed below: (1) Transferring land tax revenue to the central government and converting it to in-kind taxation. In accordance with the Eighth Plenary Session's resolution to "provisionally transfer land tax revenue from all provinces to the central government for coordinated reorganization," it was decided to implement a plan for transferring land tax revenue to the central government and converting it to in-kind taxation. With regard to the transfer of land tax revenue, land tax administration offices will be established in each province, city, and county to handle land tax collection and land reporting. The matter will still be overseen by the provincial financial council. As for improving the collection system, promoting land reporting, strictly enforcing land tax collection, and selecting and training land tax personnel, all of these have been carefully reviewed and separate plans have been decided upon. With regard to the conversion to in-kind taxation, the standards for collection have been repeatedly studied, given the different levels of fertility and varying prices of land in different areas, and the varying amounts of revenue and the varying weights of grain quotas. It is stipulated that the standard for collecting in-kind land tax should be two shih (石, a unit of dry measure) of rice per dollar of the total amount of principal and surtax on land tax for the 30th year of the Republic (1941). Wheat-producing areas may collect wheat of equal value, and miscellaneous grain-producing areas may collect miscellaneous grains of equal value. Provinces with heavier tax burdens may request that the Ministry of Finance appropriately reduce them. As for collection procedures, they are divided into two parts: tax assessment and tax collection. Tax assessment falls within the scope of tax administration, while tax collection is handled by grain administration agencies. If this is faithfully implemented in the future, it will greatly benefit the supply of military rations and civilian food. (2) Abolishing taxes and levies with the characteristics of transit taxes and replacing them with wartime consumption taxes. Past financial conferences have all strived to abolish illegal taxes and levies, and the resolutions that have been passed have had considerable success. Since the War of Resistance, however, many provinces, due to financial deficits, have independently added transit taxes on goods, or levied fees in the name of management and control. There are inspections everywhere and heavy levies at every stage, which greatly affects the wartime economy in the rear. This conference resolved to abolish taxes and levies with the characteristics of transit taxes in all provinces and replace them with wartime consumption taxes. The central government will coordinate taxation based on the nature of consumer goods to conform to the wartime intent of frugal consumption. At the same time, it is also clearly stipulated that the central government will coordinate compensation for the deficits caused by the abolition of taxes and levies in various localities, in order to achieve the goals of unblocking cargo transport and stabilizing prices. (3) Improving the Business Tax Law. The Business Tax Law was promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and has been in effect for a long time. It is not entirely suited to wartime conditions, so the tax law should be revised and the tax rate appropriately increased. There are also strict regulations on other matters such as revising the collection time, stipulating the method of collection, and managing merchants' accounting books. (4) Unifying anti-smuggling efforts. Currently, there are overlapping anti-smuggling organizations and inspections at every stage, which often inconveniences merchants. Therefore, the central government has already stipulated measures to unify anti-smuggling efforts. In the spirit of this, this conference resolved that the two types of anti-smuggling work—tax revenue and materials—should be handled uniformly by the Ministry of Finance, in order to simplify inspection procedures and strengthen anti-smuggling forces. (5) Improving personnel management. Now that there have been various improvements in tax administration and the tax system, the work of financial personnel in the future will naturally be more important and their responsibilities greater. The need for specialized talent is increasing. In order to promote work progress and increase efficiency, this conference resolved to universally train financial personnel, improve personnel management, raise their intellectual standards, increase their work efficiency, and improve their salaries and benefits, so that they can be assured in their duties and work diligently for the public good. In this way, governance will be based on people, and accomplishments will be achieved. (6) Implementing food policies and land policies. At this time of dual consideration for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the food problem is of utmost importance. The two major policies of food and land that Premier Sun Yat-sen proclaimed should be vigorously implemented. President Chiang Kai-shek inherited Premier Sun's teachings and gave earnest instructions. These should be followed not only during wartime, but even more so during national reconstruction. China's food supply is inherently self-sufficient. Since the War of Resistance, there have been consecutive years of bumper harvests, and the supply and demand for food were originally not difficult. However, due to transportation obstacles and the failure of relief efforts, private hoarding has gradually increased. The number of local needs has surged, while the amount of overall circulation has greatly decreased. The imbalance between supply and demand is really due to the unequal distribution, not to the lack of production. For the present, it is advisable to plan for the essentials. The food problem is complex and multifaceted, but the essentials are nothing more than quantity and price. Quantity and price should be considered together and balanced, and neither should be neglected. If the quantity cannot be controlled, the price cannot be controlled. However, if the price is not properly controlled, it will not be easy to collect the quantity. This conference resolved that the two proposals—collecting land tax in kind and issuing treasury bonds to purchase food—are both extremely important. The former is to control quantity and control price, while the latter is enough to control price and gather quantity. During this period of the War of Resistance, this is a symptomatic treatment. As for the fundamental solution, it depends on the land policy, especially the reform of the rental system, the realization of "land to the tiller," and the promotion of land utilization. These are prerequisites for food policy. Sufficient troops must first have sufficient food, and sufficient food requires increased production. Therefore, the symptomatic treatment should be strictly controlled, while the fundamental plan depends on the implementation of land ownership policies. This conference decided that each resolution must be implemented step by step in order to establish a good model. (5) Other Important Matters. Other matters, such as stabilizing finance, promoting trade, and promoting the implementation of the monopoly system, are also closely related to wartime financial policy. This conference also made many important resolutions. In terms of finance, the consolidation of China's legal tender credit and the stability of the financial market in recent years are unmatched by most belligerent countries. This is due to the trust of the people and the appropriateness of government policies and measures, but the main reason is that the central financial institutions have shouldered heavy responsibilities, while local and general commercial financial institutions have not been able to take their positions and assume responsibilities. The resolutions passed by this conference aim to further strengthen the connections and provide more effective supervision, so that the operations of central, local, and commercial financial institutions are coordinated and consistent. Then, the contribution of the financial sector to the national economy, the people's livelihood, the War of Resistance, and national reconstruction will be ten times or a hundred times greater than it is today. In terms of trade, coordinating international trade is necessary during wartime. China's industry is not very developed, and most wartime supplies must be obtained from friendly countries. Therefore, promoting foreign trade is especially important. The government's trade policy has long been established and has achieved results. This conference reviewed it in detail and believes that the following five points should be redoubled efforts in the future: First, maintaining and improving the production of export goods; second, striving for swift and convenient procedures for the purchase of materials; third, reasonable and timely purchase prices; fourth, coordination of transportation and increasing transportation volume; and fifth, reduction and standardization of taxes and levies on export goods. As for the restriction of imports of non-essential goods, the government is currently strictly enforcing it. It is hoped that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be mindful of the difficulties of wartime finance and strive for thrift in daily production, advocate the use of domestic goods, and assist the government in the thorough completion of its policies. In terms of the monopoly business, state monopoly businesses have been in place in various countries for a long time. In countries where direct taxes are not yet fully developed, there is even more effort to vigorously promote them. In the past, China's financial policies have had many precedents for controlling or monopolizing salt, iron, tobacco, alcohol, and tea. At this time when we are advancing the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, with national expenditures increasing daily, it is especially appropriate to draw on the regulations of past sages and adopt the good laws of Europe and the West to run monopoly businesses. On the one hand, this will increase revenue and benefit wartime finance, and on the other hand, it will control prices and coordinate social supply and demand, in order to realize the Principle of the People's Livelihood. The proposal to run a consumer goods monopoly, which was passed by the Eighth Plenary Session, urgently needs to be implemented. This conference believes that the monopoly business has a national and universal nature and should be uniformly run by the central government. Governments at all levels of local government should not run it. All taxes levied by the provincial governments on various monopoly goods, as well as the revenue from surcharges or pawnshop businesses, should be uniformly abolished after the establishment of the national monopoly system. Conclusion. The Ministry of Finance has convened three national financial conferences. The first was in July of the 17th year of the Republic (1928). The main topic was the abolition of likin (internal transit taxes) in order to implement tariff autonomy. The second national financial conference was in May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). The main topics were the abolition of exorbitant taxes, the undertaking of land reporting, the reform of local tax systems, and the determination of local budgets. The purpose was to foster the people's strength in order to restore the rural economy, develop industry and commerce, and cultivate sources of tax revenue. However, the first two conferences were convened at the beginning of the period of tutelage. Although there were achievements, they were mostly on the negative side. This conference, on the other hand, is convened when the War of Resistance has reached its final critical stage. Its mission is more difficult, its significance is greater, and its nature is more active. For the sake of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and for the sake of national survival, the resolutions passed by this conference must be implemented. Without unified finances, there is no foundation for a modern nation, and there is no way to talk about (concentrating power). Without determined funding, there is no possibility of implementing the new county system, and there is no way to talk about (local autonomy). Without reform of tax administration and improvement of the tax system, there is no way to talk about (equalizing the burden). If food policies cannot be implemented and land policies cannot be realized, there is no way to talk about (sufficient food and sufficient troops), and even less can there be talk of (equalizing land ownership). Without these four, there is no way to achieve the goal of military victory first and victory first. If we deliberate but do not decide, decide but do not act, or act without strength, and delay the grand plan of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, then we will have no way to face the five thousand years of history above, no way to face the 450 million compatriots in the middle, and no way to face the hundreds of millions of descendants below. In the four years of the War of Resistance, the soldiers at the front have bravely sacrificed themselves, the people of the whole country have enthusiastically contributed, overseas Chinese have generously donated, and all sectors of finance and industry have worked hard to produce. All of this has been able to promote vigor, perseverance, and determination. This conference hereby expresses its condolences. The colleagues have personally experienced the difficulties of the country and witnessed the suffering of the people. Each of us, based on our conscience, has decided on various plans at this conference in the shortest possible time, with the determination to implement them and the determination to succeed. It is hoped that the gentlemen of the country will unite in sincerity and assist each other. The financial authorities of all provinces should faithfully implement them. It is especially hoped that our central financial authorities will, based on the established national policy and the spirit of hard struggle in the past four years, lead the provinces and urge them to implement them, strive for final victory, and complete the great task of national reconstruction. With one heart and one mind, let us all work together for a prosperous society. This declaration. (End)</p>
<h3>Chiang Chairman's Instruction at the Capital's War Bond Solicitation Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Chairman Chiang's Instruction to the War Bond Solicitation Committee. Vice Chairman Kong's Honor. The capital held a conference on the 26th to report on the progress of its solicitation efforts. I hereby send the following written message: The capital's first phase of wartime bond solicitation has come to a close. I am deeply gratified to be holding this conference today to report on the results. The importance of issuing wartime bonds to the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, as well as my expectations for my compatriots across the country, were discussed in detail in my Letter to Compatriots published in March. How the various provinces, cities, and overseas compatriots have responded, eagerly contributing, will depend on the official report and statistics that are yet to arrive. The capital's solicitation campaign, on the other hand, has already achieved excellent results, exceeding the original quota of 60 million yuan by a factor of one. This shows the profound understanding of patriotism and righteousness among the capital's compatriots, as well as their enthusiastic support for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. They competed to subscribe, and it was very common. Even the farmers in the suburbs, the students in the elementary schools, and the old women selling vegetables and the rickshaw pullers were able to deeply understand the righteousness, and automatically opened their purses. Although the amounts may have differed, their shared patriotic and nation-saving enthusiasm was equally fervent. Secondly, it shows that the committee members and the responsible persons of various teams worked together with one heart and one mind, and responded appropriately. Secretary-General Huang, in particular, shouldered the most responsibility and worked the hardest. All agencies, groups, and individuals who have made special efforts in solicitation and subscription will be rewarded by the committee in accordance with the regulations, in order to show our gratitude and encourage them. From the excellent results of the capital's solicitation efforts, the compatriots in all provinces, cities, and overseas must feel the severity of the national crisis, know the urgent need for national defense and economic construction, and understand that it is their duty as citizens to contribute to the country. They will certainly have the same heart and generously subscribe, determined not to let the capital be the only one to shine. Guangdong Province's original quota was 23 million yuan. It is reported that it has reached more than 32 million yuan. Guangxi Province's original quota was 15 million yuan. It is reported that it has reached more than 25 million yuan. These are still in progress. Although the exact numbers for Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hong Kong are not known, it is said that they are also quite impressive. The other places are probably the same. I have often said that this war bond solicitation is a test of the people's patriotic psychology. From what we see today, the surging and strong patriotic feelings of our compatriots are indeed incomparable to the past. This news will give great encouragement to the patriotic soldiers and show the rising trend of our country and nation, and the signs of the completion of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction are already showing. The government is giving compatriots more opportunities to serve the country and the nation. This is what I hope from my compatriots at home and abroad. (26th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Side Denies China-UK-US Alliance</h3>

<h3>Finland Violates Treaty, Soviet Union Rebukes Harshly, Finland Releases Blue Book to Counter-Accuse, President Appeals to People to Fight Against Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Moscow, TASS dispatch, 27th, June 23rd, six German planes took off from Finnish territory, trying to bomb the Kronstadt area. On the 24th, four Swedish planes tried to bomb Tsitalaksa, and some German troops tried to cross the front line. Such bandit behavior by the Finnish army is a far-reaching violation of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. The Finnish rulers have begun military activities against the Soviet Union. The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty signed on March 13, 1940, stipulates that "the two countries guarantee not to attack each other, and shall not conclude any alliance or agreement with other countries against any of the signatories." The Soviet Union has complied with the above clauses, but the Finnish rulers, under the will of Hitler, are forcing the Finnish people, who are suffering and exhausted, to fight against the Soviet Union. This unprecedented provocation by the Finnish military has aroused extreme anger among the 200 million people of the Soviet Union. The sad Finnish rulers have obviously not learned a lesson from the wars of 1939 and early 1940. There is no doubt that our heroic Red Army and Navy will inflict a painful blow on the fascist running dogs in Finland.</p>
<p>Helsinki, Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th, Finland will release a blue and white paper today, which is a lawsuit against the Soviet Union. Its content declares that the Soviet Union's ambitions are incompatible with the terms of the peace agreement. In fact, the Soviet Union's actions in violation of the treaty are becoming increasingly frequent. Since the establishment of the peace agreement, the Bolsheviks have tried their best to oppose the organization of a Nordic defense organization, and have put pressure on Finland to quickly complete the Sura railway line to facilitate Bolshevik military transport in Finland. Moscow has also proposed supplementary compensation for the ceded areas, and demanded the lease of Hango, the use of vehicles, factory equipment, houses, and labor. When surveying the new border, the Soviet representatives insisted on their own interests. The most surprising thing in 1940 was the Soviet Union's request to disarm the Åland Islands. The Soviet Union went on to demand the establishment of consulates in various parts of Finland, attempting to permanently control Finland, and also had the intention of controlling the Petsamo nickel mines. The Bolsheviks' propaganda in Finland is also becoming increasingly active. From the signing of the agreement to the period when the current relationship became tense, Finland has filed a total of 199 protests with Moscow regarding Soviet violations of the border.</p>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 27th, Finnish President Ryti gave a radio address to the nation last night, saying, "We will fight for the freedom of the country and the beliefs of our ancestors. The Soviet Union has launched new aggressions against us along our border since yesterday, but at this time, Finland is not the only country fighting. The Soviet Union is now facing a united front stretching from the White Sea to the Black Sea. If we want to reduce the pressure from the East, eliminate permanent dangers, and seek a happy and peaceful life for future generations, we cannot conduct our defensive war at this time. We absolutely trust our army and General Mannerheim." It is noteworthy that the Finnish president did not declare war.</p>
<h3>Sweden Permits German Transit; Britain Strongly Opposes; Exposing Weakness Endangers its Independence; Britain to Reconsider Attitude Towards Finland and Sweden</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that the Swedish government's decision to allow a German division to transit through Sweden to Finland was only conveyed to the British Minister to Sweden, Mr. Mallet, a few hours before it was disclosed in the newspapers. Mr. Mallet used strong language to condemn the Swedish government's decision and told the Swedish Foreign Minister that the British government was likely to strongly oppose it. Mr. Mallet's expression was very appropriate. London is regretting the Swedish government's concession, saying that it will make it more difficult to resist German pressure in the future. The Germans will fully exploit Sweden's exposure of weakness to carry out other means to reduce Sweden's power to maintain independence and neutrality. It is quite possible that the Germans will soon demand that Sweden declare its unity with Germany and be a member of Hitler's new European order.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – Reuters reporters learned that the British government is now carefully considering the communiqué sent by the Finnish Minister to Britain on Wednesday night, in which the Finnish government announced Finnish self-defense to resist the Soviet Union, and is comprehensively considering the entire position of Finland. In addition, there is another matter that the British Foreign Office is urgently considering, namely, the Swedish government's statement allowing German troops to transit to Finland. As for Finland, we should remember that at the beginning of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, it formally declared that Finnish troops were fighting side-by-side with them. This was a German trick to fabricate facts, deceive the world, and coerce the Finns, but this attempt was not completely successful at first. It can be seen from the Finnish official gazette at that time that the Finns were determined to maintain neutrality. However, it is a fact that Germany has stationed troops in Finland, placing it in a position to undermine Finnish neutrality. The British government reserves the right to attack the enemy wherever they are seen, and the Soviet Union will also do the same, feeling that it is necessary to take various measures to prevent German troops from occupying Finland and taking the opportunity to attack the Soviet Union. During the air raid on Wednesday, the Soviet side aimed at finding the location and area of German troops. Previously, Finland had allowed Swedish troops to enter northern Norway via transit, and the German army immediately used this concession to station an astonishing number of troops. The British government is well aware of this situation. It is said that Foreign Secretary Eden, in the week of the German attack on the Soviet Union, conveyed the information obtained by the British side to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky. Sweden previously granted Sweden the right to pass troops to northern Norway, and now it has expanded this concession to allow German troops to travel from Norway through Sweden to Finland. The British government is already very dissatisfied with Sweden's original concessions, and it will also condemn this new concession. According to the opinions of knowledgeable people in London, most of the Finnish people do not approve of participating in the war, and their reasons for doing so are purely due to pressure and geographical necessity. The Finnish attitude and Sweden's decision to allow German troops to transit both indicate that the alliance arising from the Soviet-German war is based on political power rather than doctrine.</p>
<h3>Turkey and Iran Notify the Soviet Union of Neutrality</h3>
<p>Ankara, Huitong News Agency, 27th – The Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Akhatay, handed a note from the Turkish government to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Wednesday, formally notifying the Soviet Union that Turkey would maintain neutrality in the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – Moscow Radio said that Iran had notified the Soviet Union of its intention to maintain neutrality in the recent stage of this world war. The Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union verbally informed the Soviet side of this intention on Thursday. The radio station also said that Soviet newspapers published detailed texts of British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech.</p>
<h3>Soviet Interests in Germany and Hungary; Sweden Agrees to Take Care of Them; German and Italian Interests in the Soviet Union; Entrusted to Bulgaria and Japan for Management</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – The German official news agency reported from Stockholm that Sweden had agreed to the Soviet government's request to take care of Soviet interests in Germany and Hungary.</p>
<p>Sofia, Huitong News Agency, 27th – The Soviet government yesterday notified the Bulgarian government, formally agreeing that Bulgaria should take over the diplomatic interests of Germany, Slovakia, and Romania in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Nazi Peace Overtures to Britain; Churchill's Firm Declaration; Illusions Shattered Without Remnants</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – According to Ankara news, Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu conveyed the suggestions made by the German Ambassador to Turkey, Bam, regarding the United Kingdom and the United States, to the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. It is believed that this proposal was conveyed by the Turkish Foreign Minister to the British Ambassador when he met with the British Ambassador on the day of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, i.e., Monday, the 1st. At that time, the two sides only met for a few minutes, which shows how firmly the British Ambassador replied. Reuters London diplomatic correspondent said that it has now been learned that the German side had hoped to create a difference of opinion among the Allied countries regarding the invasion of the Soviet Union, but it was unsuccessful. Although the news from Ankara that the German side had made peace overtures and that the German Ambassador in Ankara intended to contact the British Ambassador on this matter has not been confirmed, it is possible. Undoubtedly, at the beginning of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, the German side was convinced that Britain would not want to unite with the Soviet Union and was prepared to negotiate peace with Germany. However, this hope has been shattered by the British Prime Minister's broadcast on Saturday night, in which he said, "We are determined to defeat Hitler and eliminate the Nazi regime, and this determination will never change." Not only the United Kingdom and its dominions have this determination, but the United States, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and Poland are also prepared to release their previous resentment towards the Soviet Union, unwilling to negotiate peace, and willing to continue to fight until Hitler and Nazism are permanently destroyed, which is also what the German side saw and was greatly shocked by.</p>
<h3>Italian Admiral Urges Japan to Join the War</h3>
<p>Rome, International News Agency, 27th – Italian Admiral Ducci wrote an article in the Italian Daily yesterday, strongly urging Japan to immediately join the war while the Soviet Union is fighting the Axis powers. Ducci asked, "What is Japan waiting for? The opportunity for the United States to take advantage of the dangerous situation in Siberia and for Japan to attack the United States is rapidly disappearing."</p>
<h3>The Spanish Government Decides to Send Volunteer Soldiers to Attack the Soviet Union; Anti-Soviet Demonstrations Occur Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>Madrid, United Press, 27th – Spain formally announced yesterday that it would send volunteer troops to fight side-by-side with Germany against the Soviet Union. The Falange Party has called on Spaniards to enlist.</p>
<p>Madrid, Huitong News Agency, 27th – The Spanish government is about to issue a notice on organizing volunteers to go to Germany to participate in the war against the Soviet Union. The number of volunteers has not yet been announced, but 75% of them are soldiers who participated in the Spanish Civil War, 20% are soldiers who were arrested by the Spanish Republican Army at that time, and the remaining 5% are other recruited volunteers. The first batch of volunteers is scheduled to leave for the front line on July 3. The volunteer registration procedures are handled by the Falange Party. All volunteers will wear Falange Party uniforms and badges.</p>
<p>Madrid, Havas News Agency, 26th – Anti-Soviet demonstrations broke out again today in several Spanish cities. The situation in Toledo was particularly intense, with tens of thousands of demonstrators parading the streets and singing Falangist songs.

<h3>A Batch of Italian Troops Head to the Front Line to Participate in the War Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Rome, International News Agency, 27th – Since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini inspected a certain place in the Po River valley, the first batch of mechanized units of the Italian expeditionary force, which plans to participate in the German attack on the Soviet Union, has been on its way to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Rome, Huitong News Agency, 27th – Local newspapers pointed out that this is the fourth time in history that Italian troops have participated in the war against Russia: (1) Italian troops followed Napoleon I to Russia in the early 19th century and fought against the Tsar; (2) Piedmontese troops participated in the Crimean War (1854-55); (3) In 1918, the Italian Expeditionary Force landed in Petsamo and occupied Murmansk to threaten the newly established Soviet government.</p>
<h3>Curfew Imposed in Moscow</h3>
<p>Moscow, Reuters, 27th – It has been announced here that a curfew will be imposed from midnight (local time). All theaters must stop at 1:15. Anyone without an official mission is not allowed to enter the city at any time of the day.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the United States Consults with Welles; Officially Notifies the United States of the German Invasion of the Soviet Union; Indicates that No Assistance is Needed at Present</h3>
<p>Washington, United Press, 27th – The Soviet government formally notified the US government that Germany had launched a bandit-like attack on the Soviet Union.

<h3>Military Commission Announces One Week War Situation; 20th to 26th</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Military Commission spokesperson said that after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, because Japan was hesitating between advancing south, west, or north, the war situation this week was only characterized by the free movement of low-ranking Japanese officers stationed in various places, which was only enough to serve as an embellishment in the Sino-Japanese war. Briefly described as follows, the focus of the war this week is still on the south bank of the Yangtze River, and secondarily in Shandong and Shanxi, and there is nothing else worth mentioning. (South bank of the Yangtze River) A large number of heavy bombers and fighter planes were recently transported to the Japanese airfield in Yichang. The brave artillery unit of the First Honorary Division of the Chinese Army launched a fierce artillery attack on the airfield early on the 23rd, when the Japanese were returning from bombing, hitting 13 of the 19 Japanese planes parked in the field. The remaining six planes hurriedly flew away in the midst of the artillery fire. This is the third glorious battle record established by the artillery on the south bank of Yichang in the past year. (Note: 14 Japanese planes were destroyed in October last year, and four Japanese planes were destroyed in February this year.) Therefore, a unit of Japanese infantry and cavalry combined forces on Moji Mountain on the opposite bank of Yichang invaded Tongjiachong on the morning of the 24th, attempting to retaliate, but was blocked by the Chinese army and suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army in the Hengshitan Xiaer area of southern Hubei was followed and pursued by various units of the Chinese army, and the Japanese were completely defeated at 5 pm on the 18th. The rest retreated to Tongshan, and China has restored its original situation. Near Nanchang, more than 2,000 Japanese troops invaded from Yunkou, Dixi, Zouxiang, Yucha, Maqiushi, and Wuxishi on the morning of the 18th. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, more than 640 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and many rifles and military supplies were seized. At dawn on the same day, a unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Taizidian, east of Nanchang, and captured many prisoners. In eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese army in Yuyao invaded Longchao Village and Jinfu'an on the morning of the 18th and was repelled. (Shandong and Shanxi) More than 1,000 Japanese troops and a unit of mercenaries in Jinxiang, Cao County, and Dingtao, Shandong Province, launched a large-scale invasion of Huangdian in five routes, and fought fiercely with a unit of the Chinese army for one day. They were repelled by the Chinese army, and more than 300 Japanese commanders and captains were killed, more than 100 were captured, and many weapons were seized, including more than 1,000 firearms and four artillery pieces. On the morning of the 5th, they invaded Daliangou Qianqiuling via Wangtaizhen and were blocked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army did not succeed. Then the Japanese army increased its reinforcements and invaded Daliangou. After a brave counterattack by China, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed. On the evening of the 18th, China's 104th Division cooperated with a part of the military and civilians to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army invading Gaocheng, Southwest Caojiacun, and Nanzhangcun, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. On the 19th, a Chinese plainclothes team set fire to the Japanese grain and ammunition depot in Yongji City. At the same time, the Chinese army in the suburbs separately attacked and blocked, and violently attacked the Zhangliuzhuang Station in the east of the city, seizing a large number of prisoners.

<h3>Cotton Yarn; Yarn Market Shows Upward Trend Again; Driven by Sales from Guangdong and Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>The yarn market has risen again after hovering. The rising wind is especially strong. This is because the factory orders have dried up, while procurement from Guangdong is still booming. As a result, people's confidence has been revived. The rumor that the Guangdong brokers had stopped buying yesterday was completely false. As a result, the public's buying intention became stronger again, and the market turned from weak to strong and moved forward. It is found that the Guangdong brokers bought 1,100 bales, of which Shuangma factory orders accounted for 300 bales, and spot goods from other warehouses accounted for 250 bales, which is enough to make the market solid. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,562 yuan, and the low price was 1,550 yuan. In the early afternoon, it was initially sold for 1,563-4 yuan. Then, due to the rising premium and purchases from Guangdong brokers, people's confidence was even stronger, rising to 1,574 yuan, exceeding the previous high of 1,573 yuan. The final price was 1,572-3 yuan. If real demand continues, there is hope of exceeding 1,600 yuan. This is because the factory order inventory has decreased by 20,000 bales inside the customs, so large investors' buying intention is unabated. Today, 100 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning with flat sentiment. The initial price was 1,552 yuan, and soon fell to 50 yuan. However, the sellers in the market were not strong. At the same time, Guangdong brokers resumed buying, and people's confidence was even stronger. The situation gradually rose to 1,562 yuan, but speculators came again and retreated to 1,557 yuan. Then, due to the tight warehouse receipts, it returned to 1,560 yuan at the close. It is found that the transaction volume in the half-day was 10,700 bales. The amount bought by each broker is listed as follows:</p>
<p>The Shuangma benchmark yarn market situation is very good, and transactions are gradually increasing. As a result, the July contract rose by 1.5 yuan and the August contract rose by 4 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume for the day was 9,550 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>July Open 1420.0 1418.0 Close 1417.0 1419.5</p>
<p>Daily High 1413.5 1415.0</p>

<p>Daily High 1422.0 1423.0</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Transactions Are Prosperous; Factory Numbers Move Simultaneously</h3>

<p>In Shanghai, foreign cotton transactions are booming, so the market is gradually improving. Yesterday, in addition to a small number of Brazilian cotton transactions by the factory, the flower houses also purchased small quantities of Indian cotton.</p>
<h3>Finance; British and American Banks Collect; Foreign Exchange Slightly Tight</h3>

In the morning, due to the Japanese bank coming again to sell, and Chinese speculators coming again to sell off, the July US dollar was once hard to sell at 5.4375 yuan. However, soon Chinese banks (Zhejiang and Xing) and British (Jardine) and American (Chase) banks absorbed it, so it immediately returned to level. In the afternoon, importers had some settlements, and bankers and American banks related to a certain association had buying interest, and speculators stopped selling, and came to cover. The momentum suddenly tightened until the close, the US dollar was only 5.375 yuan, and the British gold was 3 pence 3125, both slightly tightened.

<p>Afternoon Oh-Li-Du Rumors</p>

Suddenly, there were Oh-Li-Du rumors, and Citibank actually absorbed July at 5.40625 yuan, and the momentum tightened.

It was heard that a bank related to a certain association was covering foreign exchange, which caused import traders and speculators to cover, and all parties' sentiment was originally changing upward.

The total daily trading volume was more than 30,000 taels. The swap (June rolled into July) sellers offered 70 yuan to the buyers. The cash recent situation fell back.

<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Slightly Weak, Foreign Bonds Rise</h3>
<p>In the unofficial market for public bonds, yesterday's market saw the bullish side gradually weakening, resulting in a sluggish and lifeless market. Selling pressure was relatively strong, with most believing that those currently buying were not the ones who would be collecting the interest for this period. In other words, the bullish players were about to pass the burden on to others.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Ewo Tai bought in more actively, followed by Jardine Matheson; the rest were mostly scattered retail investors buying on dips. Tung Kong offered the most for sale, while Jardine Skinner and Union &amp; Union also sold. Category C bonds twice broke through three yuan, closing at only two yuan and seventy-five cents.

<h3>Food: Morning Rise, Afternoon Fall, Rice Prices Remain Stable, Foreign Rice Arrives Continuously, Warehouse Stock Over One Million Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice first rose and then fell, with the market still in a sideways process. The spot price of foreign rice at various firms rose by one or two yuan in the morning market, and fell back slightly by one or two yuan in the afternoon market, with little overall change. However, original packages of Inchcape's rice (one stone and two dou and a half) had merchants reselling to other destinations, and the market price still saw a rise of half a yuan to one or two yuan. In the morning market, inquiries came from Ningbo and rural villages in the interior. Furthermore, the survey of foreign warehouse stocks showed a slight decrease to 1.05 million bags, and new hoarding was also being carried out, so the prices of all rice rose in unison. Subsequently, due to many arrivals in recent days, many floating chips with scattered margins sought to be released to the market along with the market. As soon as the price rose, it was immediately sold off, so the rise was immediately suppressed. As a result, the market was still boosted by customers pulling Inchcape's rice. Inchcape No. 2 Siam Six Lower Seven Up opened at 139 yuan, 141.5 yuan to 142 yuan; Road Broken Rice 115-6 yuan, futures 114.5 yuan; small pattern spot goods from 149.35 yuan to 150 yuan, transactions no less than 1,500 to 1,600 tons.

<h3>Economic Musings</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Economics (2)</p>
<p>"Only perfect sincerity in the world can manage the great principles of the world, establish the great foundation of the world, and know the transforming and nurturing of heaven and earth. How can there be any dependence?"</p>
<p>This specifically raises the great principles of the world and says to manage them. So what does the word "manage" really mean? The collected annotations say:</p>
<p>"Management is all about handling silk. 'Managing' means arranging the threads and separating them; 'weaving' means comparing their types and combining them. The great principles are the human relationships of the five social categories, and the great foundation is the complete essence of inherent nature. Only the virtue of a sage is perfectly sincere and without falsehood, so with human relationships, everyone fulfills their natural reality, and all can be used as a model for later generations. This is what is meant by 'managing.'"</p>
<p>Therefore, later generations have understood the word "management" to mean governing the world. And those with outstanding talent and learning are called "full of management," which is derived from this. As for the meaning of "economy," I believe it is based on the Book of Changes' commentary.</p>
<p>"Wisdom encompasses all things, and the Way benefits the world."</p>
<p>The "benefit" here is close to the meaning of "management," as "the Way benefits the world" is like "managing the great principles of the world." Emperor Taizong of Tang was named Shimin because when he was four years old, a scholar requested to see Emperor Gaozu of Tang and asked to see his sons. He observed Taizong and said that he had the appearance of a celestial eye, and that when he reached adulthood, he would be able to benefit the world and pacify the people. After the scholar left, Gaozu pursued him but could not find him, believing him to be a deity, and named him Shimin. However, this is still not enough to prove my point. Recently, reading the New Book of Tang, in the biography of Pei Du, I saw that the ancients' understanding of the meaning of the word "economy" was indeed like this. History says:</p>
<p>"At the time (during the reign of Emperor Wenzong of Tang), eunuchs held great power, and the emperor possessed an empty vessel. Officials lost their way, and Du (Pei Du) no longer had any economic intentions. He built a residence in Duji Xianli... calling it Green Field Hall. Bai Juyi and Liu Yuxi wrote articles and drank wine, rejoicing day and night, not asking about human affairs."</p>
<p>Pei Du served as both general and minister at the time, and his achievements affected the safety of the world. Later, seeing the eunuchs wielding power (according to the eight emperors after the mid-Tang Dynasty, seven were installed by eunuchs), he no longer had any economic intentions. The greatness of the meaning of the word "economy" here is that he no longer thought of managing the country and pacifying the world, or benefiting the people. It is unlike the current discussion of economics, which is only confined to the aspects of wealth and goods, far from reaching the original meaning. If compared to modern academic terms, then "political economy" is somewhat similar to the old meaning of "economy," but still does not fully capture its meaning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such as during the Guangxu era, when the Boxer Rebellion was suppressed and new policies were vigorously implemented, there was an attempt to imitate the "Broad Learning and Eloquent Words" examination and hold a special "economic" examination. A look at the qualifications for selecting candidates can also reveal the original meaning of the word "economy" in China. What were the qualifications for the candidates? Namely,</p>
<p>"Those with loyal and pure intentions, far-reaching vision, profound knowledge, and understanding of domestic and foreign affairs." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive. Jardine Matheson's Jia Ying vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening, directly transporting 6,000 bags of foreign rice from Siam. In addition, 5,006 bags of flat-priced foreign rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council arrived from Hong Kong and were docked at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong. This morning, they were moved to the Bund of the French Concession in Puxi for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>The market for thick and thin japonica rice has continued to be disrupted due to moldy rain and interrupted transportation. The local shop sales were slightly stronger yesterday after two days of quiet sales, so the prices of both japonica rice saw an increase of one yuan. Fresh early and late rice from Kai Nan Port was 137 yuan to 134 yuan, original packages from Zhongguan were 135 yuan, and original packages of aged japonica rice from Wuxi were 131 yuan to 130 yuan, with Zhongjue at 127-8 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market remained flat and unremarkable, with slow sales and scarce goods, so the supply and demand were balanced, and the selling price lacked change. Hong Kong Gao Yuan continued to open at 122-3 yuan, Zhongguan at 117-8 yuan, glutinous mung beans at 113 yuan to 106 yuan. Since Guoyuan had depreciated for days in a row, it triggered retail activity, and the market price also stabilized, without much fluctuation, opening at 120 yuan, Zhongguan at 118 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Still Available</h3>
<p>Foreign flour has arrived again. It was reported yesterday that Jardine Matheson's Hanyang vessel transported over 20,000 bags of flour from Hong Kong. It is now known that the company's Jia Ying vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and in addition to transporting a large amount of foreign rice, there were also 1,000 bags of flour transported from Hong Kong, which are being unloaded today. (Zu)</p>
<p>The foreign flour market has become firmer again. Since the market price had loosened after the vessel arrived, it triggered actual sales from local customers. Although the quantity was not large, the sentiment gradually became better amidst the strengthening rice and grain prices. Golden Dragon Flour and Australian Flour were priced at 32 yuan to 32.1 yuan, rising half a yuan compared to the previous day, and Red Sun Flour was 32.3 yuan and Fortress Flour was 32.7-8 yuan. It is inquired that over 40,000 bags of American flour have been shipped from Hong Kong, including Five Swallow Brand and Fortress Brand, so the selling price of Fortress Flour has not yet risen. Other miscellaneous brands also had quiet buying and selling. It is also heard that a small number of Huilong's local factory flour, Green Battleship, is being allocated at a price of 32 yuan. Flat-priced flour is still 29 yuan, with over 5,000 bags sold. There is still no formal market for wheat.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Still Feel Uneasy, Soybean Cake Rebounds Due to Hong Kong Sales</h3>
<p>The soybean market was still weak yesterday, and the sentiment remained uneasy. Floating hoarders and retail investors continued to dump at reduced prices, and the market price fell again by half a yuan to over a yuan. The unified market sold 500 bags of Tianjin Golden Yuan at a price of 47.5 yuan. 100 bags of Guisui soybeans were priced at 41.35 yuan, and 250 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans were priced at 44.4 yuan to 44 yuan. These were all scattered routes in this street.</p>
<p>The soybean cake market, which had been falling sharply for several days, had some activity yesterday due to sales to Hong Kong, and the sentiment slightly turned around. Speculators also attempted to struggle and rise again, so the market price suddenly rebounded by three or four cents. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Xinshengji soybean cake were sold spot, and over 30,000 pieces were sold in futures (price details in the market price column).</p>
<p>On the 28th, 705 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, 80 bags of beans were exported to Xiamen, 7,700 pieces of bean cake were exported to Hong Kong, 615 pieces of soybean oil were exported to Hong Kong, and 1,250 tins of raw oil were exported to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Dye Factories Demand Cloth</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market rose yesterday, due to increased demand from dye factories and hoarding by speculators. Peers and wholesale stores in this street also had rising sentiments and strong buying intentions. The selling prices of all cloths were seen to rise. As a result, white goods rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per bolt, bleached cloth, fu silk, and dark fine thread cloth rose by about 5 cents per bolt. The price of bleached cloth and colored cloth from Lun Chang rose by 1 to 2 yuan per bolt. Over 600 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street, and over 400 pieces of stamped cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and bleached twill, etc., were handled by Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang customers. Over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth were handled by Qingdao and Yantai customers in the north. Today, 1,110 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 6 pieces were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The actual sales of Dongbu cloth in this street were still strong yesterday, and the price continued to rise. The morning opening price of the leading white goods, Longtou Fine Cloth, was 47.5 yuan, gradually rising throughout the day to 48.15 yuan in the noon market. The highest price in the afternoon market reached 48.4 yuan, closing at 48.25 yuan. Medium-grade Caiqiu Feiyu was even more scarce, rising by 8-9 cents per bolt. The peak price of Four Gentlemen Serge color goods was 1.6125 yuan. When those who made a profit sold off in the evening, it fell back to 1.602 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Steel Billets, Rare Price Increase</h3>
<p>Black steel billets, which have been jumping wildly for a long time, have recently seen an even fiercer price increase. Overseas sources have been unable to keep up, and demand is still not being met. The circulating goods have become even more exhausted, creating the appearance of being completely bought up. As a result, the sentiment is hot, and those in this business are feeling high. The standard price increase ranks first among metal products. The price of old steel mill goods was 4,000 yuan per 2,000 pounds yesterday, and the price of new steel mill goods was also 3,900 yuan, a sharp increase of 200-300 yuan compared to the previous market, which is truly rare in the market recently.</p>
<p>The price of new disk rounds has been hovering for a long time due to the influence of wooden factory nails, with asking prices often hovering around 220 yuan. There are not many gains, but there are very few declines. The reason for this is that the sales of its product - nails - are not very smooth, relying only on local business, such as purchases by construction gangs and scattered retail customers, which are very limited. Recently, the hoarding by hoarders has also decreased, and it is no longer as vigorous as it used to be. The market is stagnant, and the trend is difficult to improve. Although rice is currently in a declining state, it is ultimately difficult to boost it. Its recent market trend is already evident.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji White Coal Sells Quickly - Due to Hoarders</h3>
<p>Although Hongji white coal has not arrived in large quantities in recent months, the market and general households, in view of the changing shipping environment, have spontaneously hoarded it, absorbing a large amount of spot goods, which has boosted the market. Peer shops opened at 430 yuan per ton yesterday, delivered to customers, 472 yuan per ton for lump coal, 468 yuan for decorative blocks, and 460 yuan for unified coal, including all shop charges.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Ups and Downs Seen in Coarse White Sugar and Refined White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw ups and downs. Coarse white sugar was weak, while refined white sugar rebounded by three cents. The public meeting marked the opening price of June arrivals of No. 24 coarse white sugar from foreign warehouses, which was slightly lower by two cents compared to the previous day, at 90.02 yuan to 0.1 yuan, a decrease of four cents. Taitoo refined white B mark was 106 yuan to 106.23 yuan, a increase of three cents. However, the lower grades did not improve. DY mark from Dongzhan was 94.8 yuan, and HX mark from Dongzhan was 88 yuan, the same as the previous day, but there were not many transactions.</p>

<h3>Fox Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing to Study Shanghai's Financial Situation, Meets with Financial Leaders for Thorough Review, Scheduled to Stay Here for Two Weeks Before Returning to Chongqing for Reporting</h3>
<p>Manuel Fox, an American member specially dispatched by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, and his assistant, Dr. William Taylor, flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday on the Chizania of the Java Shipping Company. They stayed at the Cathay Hotel to investigate the currency system, finance, and black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai and the occupied areas. He immediately summoned the heads of the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and yesterday met with the managers of HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and other banks for in-depth inquiries and preliminary discussions. It is heard that Fox and others will stay in Shanghai for two weeks before going to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing to report. The mission of Mr. Fox's arrival in Shanghai, the meeting with Chinese and foreign bank managers, and the written interviews released in Hong Kong and Chongqing are detailed below.</p>
<p>Recent photo of Mr. Fox</p>
<p>Thoroughly Study Shanghai Finance</p>
<p>Mr. Fox and his assistant Mr. Taylor arrived in Shanghai on the Dutch vessel Chizania at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. Important members of the Chinese and foreign banking community in the city went to the New Customs Wharf to greet them. After Mr. Fox landed, he first shook hands with each of the welcomers and then drove to the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road for rest. He refused to comment on the mission of his visit to Chinese and foreign reporters, but at 2 p.m., he summoned the responsible personnel of the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and yesterday met with the managers of three banks, British HSBC and Mercantile Bank, and American Citibank, Mr. Hausk, Hopking, etc., to conduct a thorough review of the black market for foreign exchange and the financial currency system in Shanghai, and make preliminary research. From today onwards, he will continue to make concrete decisions on various issues.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation between Chinese and American Economies</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Fox refused to make any comments to reporters who visited him, but showed his speech delivered in Hong Kong and Chongqing, saying, "The foreign exchange stabilization fund agreed between China and the United States is an agreement of cooperation between the two major democratic countries. These two major democratic countries are now cooperating in various ways to consolidate the foundation of freedom. I (Mr. Fox) am honored to be appointed as the American representative of this stabilization fund committee, because I firmly believe that this stabilization fund is an important factor in promoting the welfare of both countries and has the function of stabilizing the currency values of both countries. China and the United States have cooperated in the monetary system for many years, and the establishment of the new agreement is a successful example of cooperation between the two countries, so as to maintain and even improve peace and order in the Pacific, and prove that the United States has recognized that China has done its utmost and has become a stabilizing factor in the economic and political situation in the Far East. This fund will not only enable China to maintain and develop its foreign trade, but also be relied upon for domestic reconstruction and construction. China has also concluded an agreement with the United Kingdom, whereby the United Kingdom lends the foreign exchange stabilization fund 5 million pounds, which is the same as the Sino-US agreement. The Sino-British and Sino-US agreements are a powerful expression of the friendly relations between the major democratic countries of the three major continents of the world, and are a good model for international economic cooperation, and are expected to safely weather the current difficult period.</p>
<p>Focus on Maintaining the Black Market for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>As for the content of Mr. Fox's meetings with the financial community in the past two days, because the matter is important, it is strictly confidential. According to reliable sources obtained by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency from responsible parties in the banking community yesterday, the focus of the discussion is on emphasizing the maintenance of the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai. The Stabilization Fund Committee believes that Shanghai is the only major port in the Far East, the hub of Chinese finance, and the center of national trade. For the sake of trade with China by friendly countries, it has decided to continue to maintain the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai and is willing to work with banks in friendly countries to ensure that the Chinese legal currency and the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States are permanently stable. It is heard that HSBC and other banks have long provided full assistance and cooperation to the measures of the Stabilization Fund Committee to facilitate its progress.</p>
<p>Market Stability and Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial market has been as stable as ever since the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have made every effort to maintain it. As for the black market for foreign exchange, because the Stabilization Fund Committee continues to maintain it, and due to the arrival of American member Fox, all market rumors have ceased and people's minds are stable. The British HSBC Bank's foreign exchange quotes are unchanged, so that speculators have no way to manipulate them, and the exchange rate between the British and the United States is neither honorable nor disgraced. The legal foreign exchange announced by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has not changed, and the actual foreign exchange transactions are few. As for the gold and commodity markets, due to the stabilization of the black market for foreign exchange, there is not much ups and downs.</p>
<p>Both are Economic Experts</p>
<p>Mr. Fox is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, and graduated from Cornell University in 1922 with an engineering degree. In 1924, he received a master's degree from New York University. He has served as an inspector for the Michigan Tax System Committee, an efficiency expert for Empire Art Metal Company, and an assistant to the Evaluation Committee of New York Central Railroad Company, and has also taught at several universities. In addition, he has also been a member of various departments of the US Tax System Committee. From 1939 to 1940, he served as the chairman of the US Economic Advisory Group to Venezuela. The decision to appoint him as a member of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund was announced by US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on May 1 this year. Before becoming Mr. Fox's assistant, Mr. Taylor served as an economic expert at the Monetary Research Institute of the US Treasury Department. He was a professor of Far Eastern Affairs at the University of Hawaii for many years. He only joined the US Treasury Department in January of this year. He obtained a PhD in philosophy from the University of California in 1935, and in that year and the following year, he conducted a thorough investigation in various European countries.</p>
<h3>German Merchants in Shanghai Decide to Shorten Business Hours Starting Next Month, Goods Temporarily Stored in Japanese Warehouses, Transportation of Goods to Germany Has Been Obstructed</h3>
<p>According to informed sources, since the outbreak of the European War, the Siberian Railway has been Germany's economic lifeline to the Far East. However, since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, German merchants in this city have suffered great losses. Therefore, merchants in this city have decided to shorten business hours starting on the first of next month, reducing them from eight hours a day to five hours (i.e., from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. every morning). At the same time, goods that were previously planned to be transported to Germany on Japanese merchant ships cannot be transported, so they are temporarily stored in Japanese warehouses. According to a German merchant who spoke to reporters, Soviet people in Shanghai had long known that Soviet-German relations were about to become tense, so they took two steps to obstruct German merchants in this city from transporting goods to their country. The methods were (1) increasing freight rates to 800 percent and (2) making it difficult for German goods purchased in Shanghai to pass through Soviet territory to be transported to their country, making it difficult to obtain transit permits. Currently, German ships traveling between Germany and Shanghai have all stopped, and German trade with Shanghai has almost completely stopped. The main German goods transported to Shanghai are pigments, Western medicines, and sewing needles, while the main Chinese goods transported to Germany are mineral sands and industrial raw materials.</p>
<h3>German Nationals Request Change of Postal Routes</h3>
<p>For the convenience of postal delivery, the German Chamber of Commerce in this port has decided to request that mail between Germany and Shanghai be changed to be transported to Germany via South America and transported by Japanese ships. It has now begun to be implemented, but it is being transshipped through the United States. It is estimated that there will be no obstacles, because the relations between the United States and Germany have not yet reached the point of rupture. Afterwards, it will depend on the evolution of the international situation. The European mail originally sent from Shanghai was sent via the Siberian Railway. Due to the impact of the Soviet-German war, mail to the five countries of Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Turkey, other countries such as Germany, Finland, Romania, and Italy Mail to other countries such as Germany, Finland, Romania, and Italy has been discontinued on that line, and has been changed to be shipped via the Pacific Line. The number of shipments has been changed to two shipments per week. Mail to Central European countries is shipped from Shanghai to the United States, transferred to trains in San Francisco and arriving in New York, and then transferred to mail ships to Europe.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Press Community Mourns Li Junying</h3>
<p>After Mr. Li Junying, deputy manager of the Greater America Evening News, was killed on the 23rd of this month, all parties expressed deep sorrow and sent telegrams to Mr. Li's family to express their condolences. It is now known that the Chongqing press community has continued to send telegrams to Shanghai. One is from the Central News Agency, "Transfer to the family of Mr. Li Junying of the Greater America Evening News. Mr. Junying dedicated himself to the news industry. Being in a dangerous place, he upheld righteousness and did not compromise. He died in the line of duty. Hearing this from afar, we are deeply saddened. We hereby send our condolences and hope that you will restrain your grief and fulfill his will. With deepest respect, the Central News Agency." The other is from the Chinese Journalism Society, "Transfer to the family of Mr. Li Junying of the Greater America Evening News. We have just heard that Mr. Junying was killed. Our press community has lost another member. The death of a loyal and upright person is shocking and sad. We hereby send our condolences and hope that you will change your grief and help with major events. With deepest respect, the Chinese Journalism Society."</p>
<h3>Pacific Hurricane Threatens the Coast, Bad Weather, Very Low Temperature</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the moldy rain continued in this port, and the temperature was quite low, as if it were early autumn. The Pacific hurricane has approached Taiwan and is heading towards China. A reporter from the Datong News Agency recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Continuing Heavy Rain</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, who learned from the Xujiahui Observatory, the weather in this port is still controlled by the mold season. Because the weather conditions in the Yangtze River basin are bad, heavy rain is continuing. Shanghai has no hope of clearing up for the time being, because the rainwater cannot be discharged in time, and the Huangpu River has high tides, so the roads are flooded and cannot be drained. In low-lying areas, there is still standing water.</p>
<p>Hurricane Progress</p>
<p>The temperature was also particularly low yesterday. According to records from the Xujiahui Observatory, the lowest temperature at 5:00 a.m. was only 67.3 degrees, unlike midsummer, like early autumn. The new Pacific hurricane had reached 17 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, and was moving in a northwest direction. The wind force is unknown.</p>
<p>Threatens the Coast</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned coordinates, the hurricane is already within 100 nautical miles east of Luzon and is approaching Taiwan. The southeastern coast of our country has also begun to be seriously threatened. Therefore, the Observatory and the Jianghai Customs are paying attention to its development, so as to provide guidance for navigation to avoid it appropriately and avoid being attacked.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Groups Celebrate International Cooperation Day</h3>
<p>July 5th is International Cooperation Day (the International Cooperative Alliance decided at its 10th conference in Barcelona in 1930 to hold the first Saturday of July of each year as International Cooperation Day, and this year is the 21st anniversary). Various cooperative organizations in this city are preparing for commemorations. Foreign cooperative organizations will also celebrate individually, actively promoting cooperative undertakings to achieve human solidarity and mutual assistance.</p>
<h3>British Tram Increase Prices Today</h3>
<p>The problem of price increases by the Shanghai British Tram Company has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council and will begin today. The approved fares and routes are increased by nine-tenths of a cent and one mill per mile for first class and seven-tenths of a cent and twenty-nine mills for third class. At that time, the company will uniformly increase the allocation of fares at each station by 50 percent. It is also known that the company's monthly and seasonal tickets will also increase in price starting next month.</p>
<h3>Strong U.S. Naval Power: Capable of Two-Ocean War, Major Fleet Deployable to Far East if Necessary - Pacific Society Representative, Mr. Tack Shepherd, Speaks</h3>
<p>Mr. Tack Shepherd, a representative of the Pacific Society, completed his investigation of countries such as Canada and returned to Australia via Shanghai. According to his statement to reporters, "Of all the places I have been, the people who express the deepest concern about the Far East issue are the Americans." Regarding the issue of the United States' participation in the war, Mr. Shepherd stated that some Americans have long known that this move will be inevitable. However, they are still strongly opposed to it, believing that participating in the European war will only bring losses and no benefits. The situation is the opposite in the Far East. Therefore, the U.S. government can freely take a hard line in the Far East without facing opposition from isolationists. In Mr. Shepherd's opinion, the U.S. Navy's capability is sufficient to handle a two-ocean war because the Atlantic Ocean does not require a large number of warships. If necessary, a large part of the navy can be transferred to the Far East. Mr. Shepherd has been in North America for two years. For the last six months, he lived in California in the southern part of the United States. He is currently on his way from the United States to Australia and plans to travel to Annam and Chongqing to investigate the local economic and political situation.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Liners: Continued Sailing Schedule Arranged, Only First-Class Cabins Available on Shanghai-San Francisco Routes, New Freighter "Fleetwood" Arrives This Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the U.S. government slightly adjusted all seven mail ships of the U.S. President Lines, the company decided to dispatch other mail ships to continue operating on routes to the Far East and around the world. Therefore, traffic between the Far East and the United States will not be affected. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency,</p>
<p>Names of Ships Not Announced</p>
<p>(1) The company's President Pierce, after being ordered to be slightly adjusted, has not yet concluded its voyages. It is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on the second of next month (July), calling at Shanghai and Honolulu along the way, and proceeding directly to San Francisco and Los Angeles in the United States, no longer stopping at Kobe and Yokohama, Japan. (2) The company's President Madison has decided to depart from Hong Kong on July 15 and sail directly to San Francisco, only calling at Honolulu, not calling at Shanghai or Japan. It will only carry first-class passengers, and all cabins on the ship have been fully booked. (3) The U.S. mail ship departing from Hong Kong on August 23, the name of the ship has not yet been announced, but it is said to be the President Harrison, which will call at Shanghai and Honolulu along the way and return to San Francisco. However, the ship only has first-class cabins, and the ticket from Shanghai to San Francisco costs US$355 per person. (4) The U.S. mail departing from Hong Kong on September 20 (ship name not yet announced) will call at Shanghai and Honolulu along the way and arrive at San Francisco. It also only has first-class cabins, and the ticket from Shanghai to San Francisco costs US$365 per person. It is also learned that the U.S. President Lines is still considering the schedules and sailing routes of more than ten other mail ships that will formally continue to sail on the Far East and world routes.</p>
<p>New Type of Freighter: Regularly Sailing</p>
<p>The U.S. Maritime Commission suggested a plan to build the U.S. freighter Fleetwood, weighing 6,751 tons. It will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon on its maiden voyage from Seattle, USA, carrying cargo. It will berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired with the manager of the ship, Dodwell &amp; Co., Ltd., the ship is the sister ship of the company's previously decided to come to Shanghai, the Alife. It was built by the U.S. Maritime Commission. This is the second new freighter to come to Shanghai for the first time. It carries a large amount of flour and gasoline, weighs 6,751 tons, can hold 8,500 tons of cargo, is made of steel, and can travel 14 nautical miles per hour. From now on, it will regularly sail between Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, the Pacific Ocean, and the United States, and will come to Shanghai once a month. It is reported that the ship is one of the 200 merchant ships that the U.S. President requested Congress to pass during the 77th Congress, which will be used to sail between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to maintain shipping.</p>
<p>Fundraising for Women and Children's Relief Association</p>
<p>The China Women and Children Relief Association is the only organization in China that rescues abducted and lost women and children. It has a long history of 31 years. Because the Jiangwan hospital was destroyed, it once held a fundraising campaign for construction funds, but it was not fully funded. It is learned that the association is currently preparing a Shanghai Yue Opera Grand Assembly to continue fundraising. The association provides purely humanitarian services. There are still more than 700 women and children in the hospital. Although the authorities of the two concessions allocate funds each year to help, due to high prices, it is far from enough. It is hoped that benevolent people will jointly assist.</p>
<h3>First Batch of U.S. Aid to Soviet Union: To Be Shipped from Philippines to Vladivostok, Four Soviet Ships Berthing in Manila Awaiting Departure, Four Soviet Ships Stranded in Shanghai Still Under Repair</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, there are rumors that four Soviet cargo ships currently being repaired in Shanghai will soon sail to Manila to join other Soviet ships to transport U.S. goods to Vladivostok. The Hongyun Shipping Bureau has denied this statement, saying that the four ships are currently undergoing major repairs and will not be completed until the end of July or August.</p>
<p>Tin and Machinery: Shipped from U.S. to Vladivostok</p>
<p>According to news today (27th), after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the first batch of U.S. materials to the Soviet Union will soon be shipped from Manila. There are currently four Soviet ships berthing in the port, which will carry U.S. tin, machinery, and other materials to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Soviet Émigrés Donate to Red Army</p>
<p>According to the North China Herald, it was learned yesterday that several Soviet émigré groups in Shanghai are currently planning to establish a special war donation, similar in nature to the British émigrés. The Russian-language newspaper in Shanghai has already received many donations to the Soviet government. Several Soviet émigré groups declared that although the Soviet government has not requested financial assistance from overseas émigrés, Soviet émigré donations will be given to the Red Army, and it has been suggested that the donations collected in Shanghai be used to purchase specially built ambulances for the Soviet army.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Still Lingers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) dredged the sources of rice and suppressed prices, and the lives of residents were able to breathe. The labor unrest has also decreased day by day. According to the SMC Police Department, only 25 labor disputes occurred last month, affecting 4,280 workers and resulting in the loss of 15,166 working days. The total number of workers employed in factories in the Public Concession and the areas outside the Concession's roads is 227,750. Compared with the 10,577 workers who went on strike in May and April, resulting in the loss of 81,145 working days, it has decreased sharply. In this extraordinary period, it is hoped that labor and management will be sincere with each other, tide over the difficulties together, and eliminate various strikes.</p>
<p>Cinema Labor Disputes Resolved</p>
<p>Regarding the labor disputes caused by the unauthorized dismissal of employees by the management of the Shanghai Guang, Empire, Paris, Golden Gate, Jiu Xing, and Wu Xing cinemas, it is learned that after sincere consultations between representatives of labor and management, they have been resolved one by one. (1) The management of the Paris and Jiu Xing cinemas has agreed to transfers. (2) The Golden Gate management has promised to ensure that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and the cinema will try to introduce the dismissed workers to jobs. As for the Shanghai Guang and Empire cinemas, labor and management are still continuing consultations and are expected to be resolved satisfactorily in the coming days.</p>
<p>Tea Workers' Go-Slow Strike</p>
<p>There are more than 500 tea shops in Shanghai, with a total of about 1,500 employees. Affected by rising prices, the monthly income is not enough to cover expenses. They jointly made requests to the shop owners for increased wages and improved treatment. Because the shop owners refused to accept, they started a joint go-slow strike yesterday morning, which is still ongoing. It is said that the management will send representatives to negotiate sincerely.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Announces Measures to Prevent Floods (Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Installation of Spherical Valves in Gutters</p>
<p>In addition, the area around Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, which is close to the Huangpu River and has a lower ground level, is also prone to flooding during high tides. Moreover, when there is heavy rain, rainwater from all areas flows into this area, making it difficult to drain. The Public Works Department has installed spherical valves in the gutters on each road to prevent gutter water from overflowing onto the ground. However, when these valves are closed, the water accumulated on the ground due to heavy rain cannot be drained. Therefore, an opening is opened at the lowest point to connect to the sewage pumping station nearby. This type of pumping station drains surface water and sewage. In recent years, the area where water accumulation has been most severe is the western district and the adjacent areas outside the concession. Recalling ten years ago, the former Shanghai Municipal Government designed and drew a road system map for the area outside the concession. Unfortunately, these roads were not built.</p>
<p>Raising Road Surfaces and Laying New Pipes</p>
<p>In the past three years, small industries in the area outside the concession have developed rapidly. Since they are not managed by any municipal authority, most of the drainage facilities in the area have been damaged. When there is heavy rain, the water flows through the nearby roads and into the gutters in the western district of the concession. The area that accumulates water is equal to the size of the central and western districts of the concession. The impact of the water flow can be imagined. The area is as wide as mentioned above, and it is densely built with few roads. Therefore, in addition to taking some improvement measures, it is not possible to design any specific improvement methods. Equipment such as the one mentioned above has been installed on the gutters in the Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road area and connected to the pumping station on Yuyuan Road. In addition, the areas around Jisifei Road, Dunxin Road, and Anhe Temple Road have been rebuilt and raised, and new large gutters have been laid. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Cousin Lovers Commit Suicide by Poisoning: Both Studying at Universities, Die Together from Poisoning</h3>
<p>Li Zhihe, a 16-year-old girl from Wuxi, residing at 1811 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, is a student at Nanyang Model Middle School. Her parents are far away in Chongqing. Her cousin, Zhu Zhongming, 23 years old, is studying at Jiaotong University and resides at Li's house. The two have deep feelings for each other. Unexpectedly, Li's parents telegraphed from Chongqing, ordering Zhihe to go to Chongqing after the summer vacation. Zhongming tried his best to prevent her from going far away, making Li in a dilemma. On the one hand, she was forced by strict orders that were difficult to disobey, and on the other hand, she felt that it was difficult to part with her lover. Both parties agreed to commit suicide together. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., both swallowed heavy doses of poisonous liquid medicine. Later, the maid discovered it and reported it to the French police, who called an ambulance and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital. Treatment was unsuccessful, and they both died shortly after.</p>
<h3>Prisoners in French Concession Prison Go on Hunger Strike: Total of More Than 4,000 People, Demanding Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>All 4,000 prisoners in the prison on Masnan Road in the French Concession are on a hunger strike from 12:00 noon yesterday, demanding improvements to their treatment and food, which are extremely harsh. They have repeatedly requested improvements in the past, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>French Electric Company Copper Foreman Narrowly Escapes Murder</h3>
<p>Shi Quanfu, a 35-year-old local copper foreman at the French Electric Company, lives at 792 Beile Road in the French Concession. Two weeks ago, he was attacked with an axe but survived. At around 8:00 p.m. last night, Shi was cooling off at his doorstep when another person suddenly came up and tried to show a handgun, looking like an assassination attempt. Fortunately, Shi was alert and quickly turned around and hid, while blowing a police whistle. The assailant, seeing that the matter was exposed, fled with his weapon. Shi escaped death, but was frightened.</p>
<h3>Mr. Fox Praises Morale in Chongqing, Talks About U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>Mr. Fox, the Italian member of the Chinese Stabilisation Fund, expressed his high admiration for the public's enthusiasm and discipline in the wartime capital Chongqing during Japanese air raids. He said that he stayed in Chongqing for 11 days and encountered six air raids. Anyone who stayed in Chongqing briefly felt the people's spirit of endeavor and strict discipline. Looking out the window of the office, the citizens rushed back and forth. Soon, the air raid signal rose in a prominent place, and the people moved in an endless stream into the air raid shelters, their demeanor calm and orderly. During his stay in Chongqing, he encountered six bombings and had to adjust his working hours in order to conduct research.</p>
<p>Supplying China with Large Quantities of Military Equipment</p>
<p>Mr. Fox told reporters in Hong Kong that the United States is now doing its best to supply China with sufficient military equipment for a general counter-offensive. The United States' aid to China is now being carried out in the following three ways: (1) Under the Lend-Lease Act, various armaments and necessary items are supplied to China without cash. Even with cash, it is difficult to buy these items in the United States now. (2) The Export-Import Bank loans money to China to buy flour, cotton, textiles, trucks, asphalt for building the Burma Road, and other materials from the United States, and China uses tungsten, tin, antimony, tung oil, and other items as compensation. (3) The Foreign Exchange Equalisation Fund is used to stabilise China's legal tender and establish commercial credit unions. Mr. Fox added that the United States has prepared a large amount of armaments, which will soon arrive in China. In order to use these materials, the newly established "China National Defense Materials Supply Committee," chaired by Mr. Song Ziwen, has begun working in Washington. Mr. Fox added, "Mr. Currie, Roosevelt's personal representative who came to China to observe several months ago, is now devoting all of his time to studying the various issues related to U.S. aid to China."</p>
<p>Defending Democracy, Fighting Together</p>
<p>On June 10, Mr. Fox said in a speech at the American Club in Hong Kong that "If we can handle the many difficult and complex problems we face in this spirit of friendly cooperation, it will not be difficult to achieve satisfactory solutions. We are pleased to learn that Americans are very popular in the Far East, and the sincere friendship between the Chinese, British, and American people is even more superfluous to say. The cooperation between Britain and the United States in the East is the same as in the West, and this is particularly obvious. The two countries have common interests in resisting aggression and defending democracy in the West, which are no less than those in the East. It is already well known to the world that fighting for democracy is not divided into East and West. Today, countries that sympathize with democracy in the world are convinced that strengthening the strength of Eastern democracies is tantamount to strengthening the strength of Western democracies."</p>
<p>Mr. Fox continued: "I dare to certify that the American people now have the most sincere and sincere sympathy for China. The friendship between the two countries is unprecedented. We are cooperating with China in many ways. What we are doing now is in the economic field. China is suffering from aggression, and the economic difficulties are still huge. The Chinese government is constantly paying attention to this and trying to solve it. We hope to do our best to help it succeed."</p>
<h3>Dismembered Female Corpse Case: Police Clarify the Truth, Mother and Son Living Together Suddenly Disappear, Obtain Clues, Arrest Four Criminals in Suzhou, Mastermind Criminal Sun Wang Still at Large</h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, a headless, limbless female corpse was found on the street near Baike Road and Beihe Road, wrapped in floral cloth and a quilt. After the patrol found it, they reported it to the police, who verified and collected the corpse. Subsequently, Wang Runhe, Deputy Detective of the Xinzha Police Station, and Detectives Chen Baozhong and Zhang Faxiang clarified that the deceased was named Zeng Liang, a native of Suzhou, 42 years old, living at No. 10 He'anfang, Lane 139, Changsha Road. They also arrested four criminals in Suzhou's Guangji Bridge area together with the Japanese military police: Wang Gendi, his wife Wang Ding, Ma Jinhai from Pudong, and Wang Amao from Jiangbei. They were escorted to Shanghai and detained at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court and requested to be detained in order to apprehend the fugitive mastermind, Sun Wang.</p>
<p>Recovery of Dismembered Body Parts</p>
<p>According to Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station, at 1:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month, Chinese Constable No. 1853 telegraphed the police station, saying that there was a headless corpse on Beihe Road with its limbs dismembered and wrapped in a quilt. They ordered detectives to investigate and transport the corpse to the morgue for verification. On June 10 and 12, the Water Police Station recovered a left hand and two parts, a right leg and a right foot, from the Suzhou River. They notified the police station to bring them back. After the doctor verified that they were connected to the female corpse, Chen Baozhong, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, found that a Suzhou woman named Zeng Liang, living at No. 10, Lane 139, Changsha Road, was missing.</p>
<p>Mystery of Disappearance</p>
<p>Moreover, Sun Wang, who lived in the same room as her, and her son Guoliang and a maid were also missing at the same time. The miscellaneous items in the room were also moved away, and the traces were suspicious. They began to investigate and contacted various moving companies. Later, it was found that the Shanghai Moving Company at No. 123 Gordon Road was responsible, and it was learned that they had moved to the relatives of Sun Wang at No. 46, Lane 850, Haige Road. They rushed to Haige Road to investigate, but the people had already fled. Only a murder weapon was copied. The ex-wife of the deceased's former husband, Zeng Li, also identified the deceased as Zeng Liang without a doubt.</p>
<p>Obtaining Clues</p>
<p>The suspicious reason for this murder is that the deceased had a savings of more than 10,000 yuan, and Sun Wang, who liked to gamble, lost a lot of money. Since she lived with the deceased, she knew everything about her situation, so she planned to murder her for money. It was found that the defendant Wang Gendi was Sun Wang's younger brother and was highly suspected in this case. After a detailed investigation of their whereabouts by the detectives, it was known that they had fled from Pudong to Suzhou. They ordered informants to follow them to Suzhou to investigate and arrest the four defendants in this case.</p>
<p>Process of Abandoning the Corpse</p>
<p>According to the defendants' confession at the police station, the deceased was killed on June 1. Afterwards, Sun Wang instructed them to dismember the body and remove it. First, Ma Jinhai rode a bicycle on June 6 and threw it into the Suzhou River. Wang Amao and Wang Gendi threw away the limbs separately. The couple Wang Ding transported the corpse, and so on. Subsequently, a Cantonese woman, Zeng Li, reported to the police, proving that the deceased was the former wife of her husband, Zeng Shuxian. The quilt was the one that Sun Wang's son Guoliang usually used.</p>
<p>Criminals' Confessions</p>
<p>When interrogated, Wang Gendi confessed, "I was completely fooled by my sister Sun Wang. The murder of Zeng Liang was done by a man surnamed Yu at her request. Afterwards, my sister ordered me to remove the body, so I hired Ma and Wang to help. Ma Jinhai chopped off her head, and Wang Amao chopped off her feet. I chopped off her hands and threw them into the Suzhou River separately," and so on. When questioned, Ma Jinhai and Wang Amao confessed that Wang Gendi had recruited them to help put on the dead man's clothes. When they arrived, they were instructed to remove the body. The hands, feet, head, and face were all thrown away by them, but Wang Gendi did all the dismembering. Wang Ding confessed that she and her husband jointly transported the corpse to Beihe Road without denial. The interrogating magistrate verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained pending a further hearing in seven days.</p>

<h3>Chen Linsheng Lectures on Doubles Table Tennis Rules</h3>
<p>The sixth public lecture of the Table Tennis Referee Training Class was held at the Yucai Primary School at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Dagu Road last night at 8:00 PM. Lecturer Chen Linsheng spoke on "Doubles Rules." According to Chen, table tennis, also known as ping pong, originally included both singles and doubles. In the past ten years or so, singles has been enthusiastically promoted and has become extremely popular, while doubles has not received much attention. However, in European and American countries, both doubles and singles are given equal importance, and the exciting aspects of doubles are even more interesting than singles. The Chinese table tennis community should take it one step further and catch up with the world stage by quickly engaging in more doubles training. He then gave a detailed explanation of the doubles rules, which are not commonly seen, and are recorded for reference.</p>
<p>(1) All singles rules apply to doubles, except as specified in the following rules. (2) In the middle of the ping pong table used for singles, parallel to the straight side edges and connecting the horizontal side edges at both ends, draw a half-inch wide white service line, dividing each side into two areas. The area on the right is the right half, and the area on the left is the left half. (3) At the beginning of each game, any player from the team with the right to serve serves first. After every five points are scored, starting from the sixth point, any player from the opposing team serves. The player who served first for the team should serve on the third, fifth serve "eleventh to thirteenth point" until the fourth, fifth point, by the second serve player of the same team to serve. Thus, every five points, the server rotates. If both sides reach ten points or more and draw, the server changes after each point. (4) When serving, the racket and ball must be placed behind the cross line. The server stands in the rear right of their area, first tossing the ball up and hitting it with the racket, so that the ball bounces first in the right half of their area or on the line, crosses the net, and lands in the right half of the opponent's area or on the line. (5) The position and order of the receivers are determined by the serve and cannot be changed temporarily. (6) If a player serves or receives incorrectly, the error should be corrected immediately when discovered. If the serve has already reached the required number, then each subsequent change must still be made according to the original sequence, as if there were no interruption. Regardless of any circumstances, the scores before the discovery are valid.</p>

<p>Learning English Lecture</p>
<h3>How to Study English (7)</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The method of practice is to use it more. If your tongue is too clumsy and you want to improve, you can try the method of the Greek orators. Hold a small, flat, round stone in your mouth and read aloud. Be careful not to swallow the stone. It is best to make a small hole and tie it with a thin rope.</p>
<p>As for the problem of conversation books, as far as the author knows, there is only one worth reading. The original price is only two jiao five fen. Readers can buy it from the Da Shu Dong Bureau.</p>
<p>Translation</p>
<p>I. Chinese: Many famous scholars in the past have discussed the conditions for translation: "Faithfulness, Expressiveness, and Elegance." This is correct. The first requirement of translation is to be expressive, but the first condition for expressiveness is the tool of "expressiveness" - Chinese. If the writing is not fluent, how can it be expressive? In the past, many people translated many books, and reading them was infuriating and torturous. Every sentence, whether read in the correct order or in reverse, was incomprehensible. Such translations can be described as "God knows," because you and I don't understand, and even the translator himself can't understand. This is all due to the translator's poor Chinese. Instead of translating such "God knows" things, it is better to use Lin Qinnan's "Flung his sleeves and rose," which is at least classical and elegant.</p>
<p>II. Original Text: Many translations are incomprehensible because the translator has not understood the original text clearly. It is true that English words sometimes have a broad meaning and it is difficult to determine the correct meaning, but the translator cannot use this as an excuse to deceive the reader. If we cannot determine the correct meaning, it is because our English proficiency is insufficient, and we should not rashly engage in translation. If the goal is only to practice English or translation methods, then of course there is a great benefit, but you must first thoroughly understand the original text.</p>
<p>III. Style: There are no secrets to translation. It is enough to thoroughly understand the original text and to be expressive in Chinese. The most difficult thing is to preserve the style of the original work. For example, it would be unreasonable to ask a philosopher to translate a science book. Similarly, it is inappropriate to ask someone who does not understand the author's personality and style to translate his work. Even if the translation is expressive, it will lose the beauty of the original. Therefore, the more knowledgeable a person is, the less likely he is to act lightly. To translate a novel, it is best to read several of the author's novels, analyze his personality, and understand his style before writing. This will make it easier to succeed. It is better to be cautious than to be criticized after publication.</p>
<p>The above three conditions for studying English and the few tips for reading, writing, speaking, and translating are all written haphazardly and are limited by space. There are many loopholes. Readers are asked to forgive me. Finally, I am reminded of one more point: read more simple texts and read more novels by standard writers. Your English will naturally improve. The secret to reading is "skimming" and not bothering too much with unfamiliar words. (End)</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Ignorance</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>Among my friends, there are several doctors who often shake their heads and sigh when talking about patients. The main reason is the ignorance of the patients' families.</p>
<p>One psychiatrist said that he had two young patients whose mental illnesses were already very obvious, and there were few ways to help them for the time being. He advised the patients' parents not to arrange marriages for the patients, because this would be a wasteful expense, and it would also affect the lifelong happiness of the other party. Moreover, their children would have a high likelihood of inheriting the tendency to mental illness, so he advised them not to let the patients marry.</p>
<p>However, self-righteous parents often ignore the doctor's advice, and after the patients are discharged from the hospital, they casually find a woman to marry them. Because some people are superstitious about "using marriage to ward off evil spirits," believing that this may cure the mental illness, but this often leads to a tragic ending.</p>
<p>Imagine what pleasure and happiness can be found in marrying a mentally ill person who cannot even take care of himself? The patients themselves often do not know what is going on. Such an unhealthy marriage is bound to fail and break down. By the time the parents regret their actions, the damage has already been done, and the lifelong happiness of an innocent woman is ruined by selfish superstition, ignorance, and a mercenary marriage system.</p>
<p>Using marriage to treat mental illness is a kind of unscientific superstition and fantasy. However, in this 20th-century society, the seeds of this ignorance still remain. This is truly a disgrace to civilization and humanity!</p>

<p>Turning mercury into gold, this age-old dream of mankind, has now been realized by 20th-century scientists. Ancient alchemists may have known that such a day would eventually come, but they could never have imagined that modern scientists would use such a huge, complex, precise, and wonderful machine - the atom smasher.</p>
<p>When an atom is bombarded by high-speed neutrons (particles smaller than atoms) emitted from an atom smasher, it splits into two, becoming two atoms of different elements. This is the most important new discovery in the field of physics in recent years. Almost any element's atoms can be split and transformed. However, the successful conversion of mercury into gold was first reported recently by two American professors, R. Sherr and K.T. Bainbridge.</p>
<p>However, this "artificial gold" is produced in very small quantities. When a pound of mercury is bombarded by neutrons, there is no visible change. We must heat and evaporate it in a vacuum to remove the mercury, leaving behind a tiny residue. We can then use chemical methods to separate the gold and other impurities to obtain a small amount of invisible pure gold - although invisible, scientists can prove its existence using precise methods.</p>
<p>"Artificial gold" also has a characteristic: its atoms are internally very unstable and can produce radium-like radioactivity, and it gradually "transforms" itself into another, more stable substance. This change is very rapid. In just forty-eight minutes, half of its quantity decays; after another forty-eight minutes, half of the remaining quantity decays again. In this way, it all vanishes in a few days. Therefore, scientists have said something very meaningful: "It runs away faster than money in people's pockets!"</p>
<p>Turning mercury into gold may not be an exciting thing today, because we can use the same machine to obtain atomic energy that is more valuable and practical than gold - the fission of atoms can produce five million times the energy of coal. Scientists are now working hard to accelerate the realization of boilers, motors, or engines that "burn" atoms. This research is being carried out very actively in fuel-starved Germany. According to a shocking report recently published in the German magazine "Natural Sciences," German researchers have been able to separate one gram of "bismuth 235" (sufficient for thousands of gallons of gasoline) using special equipment and methods. This is an epoch-making achievement, and authoritative scholars in various countries have taken a skeptical attitude towards it, but the research on atomic fission originated in Germany, and the work began at least six months earlier than in other countries, so we cannot categorically say that this news is absolutely unreliable.</p>
<p>There is also news that Germany is using atomic fission to manufacture artificial helium, which is also very possible. Helium is a gas used to fill airships, and currently only the United States has natural production in the world. Although in today's wars, airships no longer have significant importance, their spirit of striving and creating with all means is worthy of our vigilance and emulation. Where are our researchers?</p>

<p>"Third Master, what's wrong with you? Spring has come, and today is the first day it has rained!" Gouzi said with a smile, somewhat surprised that his master, who was not much older than him, already had such a poor memory. "I just hate that it didn't rain sooner or later, but it had to start raining when Mei was getting out of school, and it's raining so hard!" Qiu Haitang frowned tightly, his eyes fixed on the sky, wishing he could stop the rain immediately.</p>
<p>"I'll go right away!" Gouzi said, opening his umbrella and smiling slightly.</p>
<p>But Qiu Haitang immediately reached out and stopped him.</p>
<p>"No, let me go! The girl doesn't have galoshes, I can carry her on my back." As he spoke, he snatched the umbrella from Gouzi's hand. "You should stay at home! She was very happy with the pulled noodles you made the day before yesterday, so make another pound for her today!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Gouzi couldn't help but shrug his shoulders and chuckle secretly, covering his mouth.</p>
<p>"A pound of noodles? Looks like it's not my or your turn again!" he thought to himself.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Gouzi has come to understand too well Qiu Haitang's love for Mei Bao. Apart from anything else, the clothing of the father and daughter alone is the most obvious proof. Qiu Haitang himself wears ragged jackets and short pants, never wearing a new piece of clothing all year round; while Mei Bao is always neatly dressed. In winter, it's fur; in summer, it's silk. On days when the sun is too strong, she can wear a straw hat; on rainy days, she can wear galoshes. Although she cannot compare to the girls in the city, in this Zhangshulin Village, which is less than ten li in radius, you cannot find a second little girl who is dressed so neatly! (144)</p>

<h3>Cross-Shaped Protective Glasses</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Since Britain was bombed by German planes, new and ingenious inventions have emerged one after another. These inventions are mostly everyday items, used to protect or rescue the injured. Recently, a new type of glasses has appeared in London. The frames cover the forehead, with two round holes in the middle for the eyes to see through. Above the round holes, there are two round covers that can be raised or lowered. In the center of the covers, there is a cross-shaped hole. When German planes come to bomb, people wearing these "glasses" can lower the covers to protect their eyes, so they will not be injured by shrapnel. At the same time, their vision will not be too greatly obstructed, allowing them to safely enter air-raid shelters.</p>

<h3>Thunder God Manifests</h3>
<p>— Pin Pin</p>
<p>I happened to read "Yu Chu Xin Zhi", which contains such an interesting record:</p>
<p>"During the Shunzhi reign of this dynasty, there was a famine in Fuzhou. A rice seller in Huajin Fang was struck to death by lightning, killing three of them. There were large characters written on the corpses, which read: "兴日月水 月大查," but no one recognized them. People wrote it on the wall of the Longevity Pagoda. At night, a spider lowered a silk thread into the characters, going straight down through the nine characters of "查." Upon inquiry, it was found that the person was indeed as described, and heavenly retribution was unerring!"</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Food is the people's heaven." But those who sell the people's food try to fill their own pockets, raising the price of rice grains to that of pearls, intentionally causing the common people to become emaciated corpses in ditches: this is violating heavenly law, and suffering heavenly punishment is originally what they deserve.</p>
<p>Rice merchants are bound to do evil in famine years: relying on their own wealth, they hoard countless food supplies, buying low and selling high. Common people exchange a dou of rice for the price of gold, while the rice merchants' ill-gotten gains amount to thousands upon thousands. What's more, what kind of rice is this dou of rice worth gold? It's moldy, slightly soaked, dark yellow, fragmented, lacking, even mixed with wood shavings, mud, broken grass, and pebbles... There are as many names as there are items in their warehouses.</p>
<p>"Don't you have any better rice?" the small commoner asks.</p>
<p>"Why would there be good rice at the price you're paying? Good rice costs a stone of gold for a dou!" the rice merchant angrily replies.</p>
<p>"A stone of gold for a dou?" Thus, those who have not yet starved to death will also starve to death, and the rice weevils' ill-gotten gains will accumulate even more, by billions and trillions. Cheap rice comes, and with a magic trick, becomes something inedible. Can this be called "bestowing favor"? Where can one appeal? The law is one-sided. The dying and not-yet-dead can only helplessly hope that the Thunder God will manifest quickly. But what if the Thunder God does not manifest?</p>

<h3>A Word for the "Shanghai Drama School"</h3>
<p>— Fei Sheng</p>
<p>The entire student body of the Shanghai Drama School, ever since the school authorities signed a long-term performance contract with the Gold Theater, has performed more than a hundred shows, and the ticket sales have remained consistently strong. The author, impressed by the high praise from friends who are ardent fans of Peking opera for the students' excellent performance, recently went to the Gold Theater to listen to their singing, hoping to see for myself. That day was the school's 107th public performance, featuring "Recommending Zhuge," "Daxi Huangzhuang," and the complete "Si Lang Visits His Mother." The students' performances were able to follow the rules and adhere to the standards, which is commendable. Being able to adhere to the standards as beginners will prevent them from becoming slick and superficial. If they can continue to do so, they will gradually reach a higher level of artistry without losing the essence of the tradition. If they only seek to cater to the audience and focus on showing off, their achievements will be limited. I urge the students to heed this advice.</p>
<p>In the main act, "Si Lang Visits His Mother," Guan Zhengming played Si Lang, performing the scenes of "Visiting the Palace," "Passing the Border," "Meeting His Mother," and "Returning the Order" all the way through, which is especially commendable. His appearance is handsome, his demeanor is graceful, his stage movements imitate Ma Lianliang's elegance, and his acting style follows Tan Xinpei's simplicity. He can be considered an all-rounder. Unfortunately, his voice is not very high, which caused the tune to falter when singing (...calling the Little Barbarian...), failing to fully meet the expectation. Is this because the author wants to demand perfection from Guan Zhengming? I simply want to offer a word to the school authorities. The reason why Tan Xinpei was reluctant to go south, although there are rumors that he had offended a certain magnate, was actually due to his physical condition, which did not allow for long-term daily performances, let alone constantly performing tiring operas. Looking at the leading actors who go south, whether male or female, few do not use tiring operas as their selling point. Recently, Xun Huisheng was unable to complete his performance schedule due to being overwhelmed by the operas, which is an even more obvious example. If veteran actors who have spent decades searching for fame in the opera world still see it as a daunting task, who would say that teenagers who have not yet reached adulthood can easily handle it without exhausting themselves? As the saying goes, "Grinding tofu with a stone on your head is a thankless task." Therefore, the author's idea is that heavy and lengthy operas can be divided into different scenes, with students taking turns to perform them. For example, in the first performance, student A plays the first scene, and student B plays the last scene. Then, in the second performance, they switch roles. This way, all the students will still have the opportunity to practice universally, without the imbalance of focusing on one side. If there are more scenes, the performance can be repeated. If each scene is performed by rotating actors, it will easily achieve the practical effect of encouraging competition and progress, without favoring one and neglecting the others, and without demoralizing the public. It will certainly prevent the development of arrogance and complacency, achieving several benefits in one fell swoop. It is up to the school authorities to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>I have not had the opportunity to see the school's facilities, but given the students' achievements, I believe they must be excellent. However, the students are still young, and their nutrition and health should be given as much importance as their practice. It is generally believed that those with high and resonant voices are blessed with a special endowment. Endowment is the innate vitality and acquired cultivation. The best time to cultivate acquired qualities is undoubtedly in childhood. Therefore, I believe that the cost of the beautiful costumes (commonly known as "xing tou") for the students' performances must be considerable. If this money were used to provide nutrition for the students, it would be more practical. Simply worshiping external appearances is the biggest bad habit of today's actors, and it should be denounced without hesitation. How can it be fostered? I offer these purely objective and well-intentioned suggestions out of deep concern for the school. If you do not find them crude and condescend to adopt them, and quickly implement them, the future is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on "Female Actors Performing Male Roles"</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingchun</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Junmei's article "Discussing Female Actors Performing Male Roles," which mentioned Song Baoluo of Tianchan Theater and Xu Dongming of Carlton Theater. Regarding their singing, he said that because their styles are different, it is impossible to draw a definitive conclusion, but in terms of performance style, Xu is better than Song. This is actually wrong. Song Baoluo is not a female actor performing a male role (see correction). He has been performing at Tianchan for more than a month. Xu Dongming is a female actor performing a male role. Both of them are making their debut in Shanghai. I have seen both Xu and Song's plays several times. Dongming's voice is loud and clear, and her acting is also very experienced. In the current shortage of female actors performing male roles, she is still a promising talent. As for Song, he mixes the styles of the Tan, Liu, and Zai schools into one, seemingly proficient in everything and capable of performing any play. Leaving aside the fact that he is not pure in any one style, watching him perform the play "Quan Mu Shi Kong Zhan" while also singing "Seven Star Lamp" is definitely an exaggeration, but it can indeed satisfy the audience's desire for opera.</p>
<p>Recently, people have praised Meng Xiaodong as the foremost female actor performing male roles, because she studied with Yu Shuyan, made great progress in her art, and gained a great reputation. It is said that Xiaodong initially studied with Qiu Yuexiang, and performed at the Wuxi New World Entertainment Venue more than ten years ago. This was Xiaodong's earliest stage appearance. The plays "Slashing the Yellow Robe," "The Black Basin Case," "Slashing the Son at the Camp Gate," and "Si Lang Visits His Mother" were especially her forte. At that time, the people of Liangxi all praised her, exclaiming in admiration.</p>
<p>Zhang Shaoquan, currently at the Gold Theater, and Chen Shanfu, formerly at the Qiankun Grand Theater of the Great World, are both outstanding talents among female actors performing male roles. Shanfu's singing voice is mellow, smooth, high, and clear, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky! It is a pity that she is not a "natural foot," so she could not fully display her talents in the play's expressions and acting, and she remained in a mediocre position, not highly regarded. Shaoquan is the wife of the late famous young male actor Li Lianfang. She is skilled in performing male roles, with more than a hundred plays in her repertoire. Her singing and acting are both commendable, with the skill of a master craftsman! Now, Chen has retired from the stage for many years, and Zhang also plays old female roles and has accumulated some savings, so she is not just living as an actress.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a female actor named Weng Meiqian who is quite skilled and once had a good reputation. However, due to her deep addiction, her life was very unfortunate. In the end, she performed in female troupes at the Little World and Immortal World, eking out a living. This shows a glimpse of her desolation. Now, Meiqian is no longer in this world. At a time when female actors performing male roles are declining and talent is difficult to cultivate, the rising stars are only Zhang Wenjuan, Qiu Ledi, and Xu Dongming. However, among these three, I believe that Dongming's art, in terms of acting, seems to be above Zhang and Qiu. Even her singing is not very superficial, with clear pronunciation and resonant tones, making it enjoyable to listen to. Could it be that the recent mediocre ticket sales at the Carlton Theater are due to the high ticket price of five yuan per seat?</p>
<p>The famous young male actor Zhou Weijun is the prized disciple of Jin Zhongren. His art is exquisite, and he can perform a wide variety of plays. Therefore, he can perfectly portray the characters in "Ge Jin," "Black Clothes," "Pheasant Tail," and "Hair Crown." His movements are elegant, and his voice is clear and sweet, which is especially pleasing. This time, he assists the Xu sisters in their performance at the Carlton Theater, and it is even more delightful to see the peony and green leaves complement each other.</p>
<h3>Mei Xi and Others Plan Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— Mu Ren</p>
<p>I can report a fresh piece of news to readers: the China Film and Drama Research Institute, guided by Mei Xi, Lu Chen, and others, will open on July 1st. For the purpose of raising funds for the school, the Tianfeng Drama Troupe has scheduled a joint charity performance by film and theater people at the Majestic Theater on the morning of July 20th.</p>
<p>There will be three programs in this performance: the first is Ma Ling's play "Overture No. 1," directed by Jiang Ming; the second is Ma Ling's play "Hate Without End," which is a fairy tale play with great significance. The story tells about a group of children in eastern China who were displaced due to the invasion. Later, in a high mountain wilderness, a fairy encouraged them to take responsibility for loving their homeland and told them that courage can overcome all difficulties. The third is "The Return of the Father," a play by Tian Han, directed by Chou Quan. The Research Institute is currently enrolling students. They publish a variety of scripts. The ones that have been published include "Overture No. 1," and the ones that are being printed include "Hate Without End" and "Eternal Regret," all of which are creations of Ma Ling.</p>
<p>According to Mei Jia, he is quite interested in spoken drama in addition to making movies. He hopes to become a theater person rather than a film person in the future.</p>
<p>Brief News (1) The Dezhong Elementary School on Gu Ba Road, from yesterday to the 29th, in addition to exhibiting calligraphy and paintings by famous people and student achievements, and carrying out charity sales, will also perform recreational activities for three days, and all ticket income will be used for scholarship loans. (2) The Nuguang Drama Troupe organized by the Student Self-Government Association of Shanghai Girls' High School is scheduled to perform Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm" at the Majestic Theater at 9:30 tomorrow morning. In addition to the school's students, Ge Xin, Shao Hua, and Zhao Shu, members of the China Travel Troupe, have been specially invited to join as guest performers.</p>
<h3>Brief Biographies of Opera Figures</h3>
<p>— Nan Qiang Bei Diao Ren Zuo Zhuan, Zhang Yu Wo Zhang Zhi Tu</p>
<p>(17) Ye Shenglan</p>
<p>Ye Shenglan, a graduate of the Chang She fourth class, is a contemporary Xiaosheng actor in Peking opera who has inherited the essence of his predecessors. His "handsome" appearance and "elegant" stage presence make him a unique talent among the rising Xiaosheng actors. He is skilled in both civil and military roles. His performance as Lu Wenlong in "Eight Great Hammers" is smooth and agile, and his spear techniques are swift, which is unanimously praised by both insiders and outsiders. His performance as Zhou Yu in "The Gathering of Heroes" has a unique charm in his acting and dialogue. However, in recent years, he has also been singing Qingyi roles, which is not well received. Critics regret this! At a time when Xiaosheng talent is declining, Shenglan will surely achieve special success if he specializes in one area. If he insists on being versatile and performing both male and female roles, he will become neither male nor female, and the gains will not outweigh the losses. Shenglan is intelligent and should be able to understand this.</p>
<h3>Splashes of Blood and Gems</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Heroic and Valiant, Fiercely Fighting</p>
<p>Li Zicheng, fearing that his beloved general would suffer a loss, ordered a large force of insurgents to advance and cover him. The vanguard were all cavalry, wielding long spears and strong bows with poisoned arrows. The government troops could not resist. Zhou Yuji and Xu Jing had to abandon one tiger and retreat to cover their backs. The insurgents chased directly after them. Fortunately, the archers led by Zhang Lie released a volley of arrows, stopping the insurgents, and Zhou Yuji and Xu Jing were able to safely retreat into the city. The insurgents attacked again for a while, stopping only at nightfall. The next day, there was heavy rain. The insurgents only attacked for a quarter of an hour before retreating immediately. However, Zhou Yuji stood on the city wall, supervising his soldiers to defend firmly, without the slightest bit of slack. He stood in the rain, unmoving, his armor completely soaked. Xu Jing advised him to rest. Zhou Yuji sighed, "This is a dangerous city, defending alone, with few against many. If I cannot endure hardship, how can I make the soldiers fight hard for me?" Xu Jing was also moved. At night, the wind and rain did not stop. Zhou Yuji stood by the parapet in the dim night, gazing at the insurgents' camp outside the city for a while. He went down the city and said to Xu Jing, "Tonight, the rain is torrential. The rebel soldiers will have to cross the river to attack the city, which will be hard work. They may rest a bit and become complacent. Why don't you and I each lead 500 soldiers to raid the camp? Perhaps we can win. You are a young hero, willing to follow me and work hard to kill the rebels, which makes me very happy." Xu Jing said, "I am willing to follow the general and do my best." Zhou Yuji then selected a thousand brave soldiers and, after two o'clock in the morning, quietly left the city to attack, ordering Zhang Lie and Fan Cheng to guard the city carefully. At this time, the wind was blowing and the rain was drizzling. The civilian houses outside the city had long been burned to the ground by the insurgents, a scene of ruined wells and crumbling walls, as dark and gloomy as a ghost pit. They did not light any lanterns, but quickly marched with gags in their mouths, not encountering a single insurgent sentry. Zhou Yuji was secretly pleased in his heart. Approaching the rebel camp, he saw one or two lights still lit in the distance. Zhou Yuji and Xu Jing each killed from the left and right, suddenly lighting torches and beating war drums. A thousand soldiers, cavalry in front and infantry behind, all bravely vying to be first, and charged straight into the rebel camp. Zhou Yuji only cared about thrusting his spear horizontally, not knowing how many rebel soldiers he had stabbed to death, sweeping away many antlers and stepping into the central camp. The insurgents were all awakened from their sleep, unable to saddle their horses or put on their armor, and fled in panic, causing great chaos. (101)</p>
