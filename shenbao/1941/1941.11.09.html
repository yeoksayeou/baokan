<h3>美總統對報界宣布考慮撤退在華駐軍此舉在加强對日談判地位同時爲海軍準備作戰先聲</h3>
<p>合衆社八日華盛頓急電　此間本日獲悉、美國駐華海軍陸戰隊司令已奉命令、準備立即撒退駐華國戰隊、據悉、是項命令係羅斯福總統昨在招待報界席上宣布、渠已在考慮撤退在華美陸戰隊後發出者、據海軍當局稱、駐華陸戰隊僅九百七十人、其中七百五十名、駐在上海、一百六十五名駐天津、五十五名駐北半、</p>
<p>合衆社八日華盛頓電　昨晚此間可恃人士稱、羅斯福總統所宣布、美國第四海軍陸戰隊或將由中國撒退、其意顯在加强美國於未來對日談判中之討價還價地位、觀察家又稱目前在華之微少軍力、於一旦發生戰事將成為自殺之軍隊、國務卿赫爾拒絕特別評論麥令軍隊之撤退、惟渠回溯國務院煎嘗勸吿美僑退出中國、赫爾之語係答覆麥令軍之撒退是否與僑民有關一問題云、</p>
<p>合衆社八日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統宣布、美國第四海軍陸戰隊或將自中國撤退後、此間非官方相信係暗示關於美·日可能發展之警告、此種猜度、係根據在華海軍陸戰隊僅係代表式之軍隊之事實、一旦發生事變、其地位將遭危險、此種宣布顯係表示勸吿美僑離華之新警吿、然此間若千日本人士則稱、此種宜布或係一吉利之預兆、因日方最近嘗提出召回海軍陸戰隊、作為改善關係之一種委態、另一方面、羅斯福總統特別提出稱、此項問題在美·日談判中並未提及、因此羅期福總統抑係日方人士消息誤傳、則不明瞭、羅斯福總統用「岸上」兩字、顯然謂有若干重要之意義、或係暗示海軍陸戰隊將駐留於戰艦上、可能的逗留於亞洲海面、羅斯福總統發出此項宣布後、拒絕揣　何時將作確切之決定、僅謂、渠方「考慮」撤退在華之海軍陸戰隊、總統對此項問題拒絕答覆質問、渠特別聲稱、日本及美國並未討論海軍陸戰隊撤退之問題、渠稱、渠未知撇退海軍陸戰隊之考慮是否對中·日戰事中之領土問題發生影響、渠謂、關於在遠東海軍陸戰隊及僑民之數目無所知、惟渠回憶該處之僑民已嘗屢次勸吿其返國云、</p>
<p>對日侵華行爲美決不稍退讓</p>
<p>路透社八日華盛頓電　此間有資格觀察家、認羅斯福總統所稱、政府現芷考慮撤回在華陸戰隊一節、為心理作用、且亦防容有的不愉快事變也、若干人並認、此種宣布、當可與數月前旅日美僑之撤退、有使日本醒悟之同樣效力、蓋此亦爲撤除障碍以便與日周旋之行動也、日本報紙近所發表之仇美言論、使此間輿論愈趨堅强、此於星期四夜美總統演詞中力贊中國抗戰詞句、如中國社會進步、遭野蠻摧毀一語、而可窺見一斑、惟消息靈通之觀察家認日本特使來栖之來游、為日本亟欲與美國成立妥洽之證、蓋日本今已漸覺美國經濟壓力之痛苦矣、現悉美國地位迄無變史、仍以九國公約與對華以及在太平洋中對英、對蘇與對荷印之公布的義務為基礎、此種立摥決不容對於日本十年來侵略行為稍作退步的承認、故日本願付何種代價、以換取美國之友誼與太平洋區或之安定、比惟有由日本自決之耳、如來栖來美、希圖作强硬之折衝、則其所將遭遇者失敗而已、而日本於交涉失敗之後、似將採用如東京報紙近所威脅美國者之辦法矣、華盛頓軍界久已抱有在華美兵應予大增、或應完全撤回之意見、據最近海軍紀錄、美水兵之駐華者、六個月前共有一千五百人、北平水兵為使館衛隊、而津、滬兩處美兵、自中·日戰爭發生後、皆已大减、至於長江等處　有美國小砲艦數艘、惟美總統並未言汝之、據最近估計、美人留居中國者不足五千人、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社七日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統宣布美國現正考慮撤退在華海軍陸戰隊事、海軍界人士在數月前即已預知、美國在華海軍陸戰隊人數、行將大事核减、是故對於此事、並不表示詫異、</p>
<p>合眾社七日軍慶電　關於美　考慮撤退駐華陸戰隊事、官方保持緘默、彼等一般指出、華盛頓自知以何者為最善、但亦有人惋惜謂、此舉或被解釋為對日修好之舉動、尤其是在此時為之云、</p>
<h3>美參議院核準商船駛入戰區一俟衆院通過立付實施美在氷島設海軍根據地</h3>

<p>哈瓦斯社八日華盛頓電　此次參院通過中立法修正案、實為政府所獲空前勝利、蓋美國從此當可正式放棄孤立主義、恢復其傳統的海洋自由政策、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>「以密切合作爭取勝利」</h3>
<p>蔣委員長隔昨向外報記者發表談話，力言各民治國相互團結之利益，業已顯然可見，今後更當加倍努力，以密切合作爭取最後勝利，此與前天羅斯福總統所言：「中英蘇三國悲壯的立塲，將受美洲自由人民之完全援助」，以及「美國必須以軍械供給中英蘇三國，且必須於今日為之」，可謂旨趣相同，不謀而合。時至今日，苟欲壓制侵略陣綫的氣燄，防堵侵略禍害的擴大，除了由全世界愛好自由各國合力對付之外，可說已無一國能有單獨制勝的把握；中英蘇三國正在分頭應戰，事關國族存亡，當然不容再存絲亳懈怠，卽在美國，雖未正式參戰，但事實上早已成為侵略者的未來目標，所以也不容不以全力援助她的同道，以免他日脣亡齒寒，自貽伊戚。根據這種休戚與共利害相通的淺近理由，可知蔣委員長之對於各民治國合作前途表示樂觀，以及羅斯福總統之聲明願以全力援助中英蘇三國，都不是像軸心國家所慣用的憑、空宣傳或虛聲恫嚇，而是千眞萬確信而有徵的事實說明。</p>
<p>反觀侵略陣綫，雖然也已感到有加緊勾結的必要，以便東西呼應，實現其所謂「聯合行動」，但是在本質上，彼此所做的，旣都是些殺人越貨的不義勾當，一方面固然有合作的好處，但他方面却也有合作的風險，萬一合作不成，很容易代人受過或連帶遭殃，此所以德國雖切望日本行動，日本却依然在裝腔做勢，不敢深入，這和各民治國間死心榻地，永遠合作到底的偉大精神，相去眞不可以道里計。</p>
<p>最可笑的，日本對於三國同盟第三條的解釋，始終閃爍其詞，不肯作正面的表白。誠如外國觀察家所云，東京政府對於這一盟約，至少已有兩次逃避責任：第一次是在德國開始對蘇作戰時，日本未取行動，第二次是在最近美艦路賓傑姆斯案發生之後，德方堅稱係由美國首先攻擊，暗示日本已可援引盟約，但結果日本依然故作痴聾，表示同樣退縮。由此可見，日本所關切的，祇是它自己的利益，因此其所推行的，也祇是所謂「獨立自主」，不受盟約拘束的外交；截至目下為止，它對於盟友所盡的唯一義務，祇限於不時發出一些不負責任的强硬口號，或在南北太平洋繼續做一些恫嚇性的軍事準備，可是實際上，它目下最最注意的，還是在和美國——亦卽它歐洲盟友的敵人——進行外交談判；它為盡「最後的努力」起見，居然派遺曾經代表日本政府手訂三國盟約的來栖，趕赴美國協助野村辦理此項談判，這在希特勒的心目中，似乎應該有點異樣的威覺罷。</p>
<p>日本雖然不顧它盟友的利害，切望單獨和美國成立妥協，但是它的野心和它的短視，朦蔽了它，使它不能認淸現實，使它不能了解各民治國間早已有了共同立塲，使它不能看到各民治國休戚與共的聯帶關係。依照日前廣知時報所載七項原則，日本所希望於美國的，不但要她幫助解決「中國事件」，同時還要她承認「東亞共榮」，所謂魚與熊掌，皆我所欲；殊不知要求美國協助解決中國事件，等於是叫美國犧牲中國，這是日本忽略了中英美蘇各民治國早已團結一致的事實；要求美國承認東亞共榮，等於是叫美國退出遠東，放棄一貫的反侵略政策，這又是日本忘記了羅斯福總統迭次對民治國所發的諾言。所以東京政府無論如何熱心談判，更無論派何人為特使赴美折衝，它的根本政策一日不變，卽一日休想獲有具體結果，繼續談判的最大效用，至多不過延宕時日而已。</p>
<p>但是，觀於中美兩國領袖明快而又堅決的聲明，世人不難想像日本今後卽使想拖延時日，恐怕也無法動搖各民治國相互團結的旣成局面，更休想能緩和美國加緊援助中英蘇三國的決心，不但不能，甚至恐怕蔣委員長所作「以密切合作爭取勝利」的預言，終必有實現之一日。</p>

<h3>雲南中緬新定界及未定界的檢討</h3>
<p>— 譚廉</p>
<p>所以北段界綫，不論他是髙良工山髙黎貢山小江恩海開江，都是外交史上喪權辱國的地名，可以說他是不祥的地名，重劃界綫，應該一律廢去不用。連五色界綫，一條也沒有做國界的資格，應當一律推翻。因為五色界綫中最前綫的一條，就是外交部原定綫，也在恩梅開江東岸，已經把江心坡及邁立開江西的野人山地都劃在界外；其他各綫，更沒有討論的價値。我國以後劃界，最重要的根據，當以全部野人山地為惟一據點。除以前條約已經劃入緬境一部分外，其他野人山地都應歸我，尺地寸土，不容退讓。原則旣定，再將各土司舊時歸附我的證據提出，以作澈底的解決。此次南段勘界委員伊明德，前會調查滇緬未定界，歸後作滇緬界務北段善後意見書，對於尖高山以北的未定界，另擬一綫備參攷：該綫從尖高山起，循石峨河，向西經盤藥，循戶拱南界，至拿憂部落及曼尼坡與阿薩密交界處，然後沿戶拱坎底與阿薩密交界處的巴開山龍崗多山，直上西康與阿薩密交界處止，包括戶拱坎底野人山求夷浪速茶山各部在內，以遏阻英人由緬北入康藏的企圖。白眉初敎授也擬有一綫，是從密支那起，向東劃一綫到尖高同，再從密支那向西工一綫到孟拱，更向西北走，順邁立開江與雅魯藏布江間的分水嶺，北走，直　西康界。此綫與尹擬的綫比較，白綫向南展開，到密支那到孟拱，南端比尹綫擴張；惟順邁立開雅魯藏布江間分水嶺北走，不說明山嶺名稱，僅用分水嶺三字，是否係指靠近拿憂部落的野人山脈說的；或指枯門嶺的野人山脈說的；無從證明，易起誤會。昔年中英界務交涉，為了分水嶺三字，巳爭論得唇焦舌敝，當引為前車之鑒；不可再用含混名詞，引起後日糾紛。且南端的孟拱等處，英經營已久，恐不易使他退出。以後分劃界綫時，南端如能照白綫提出，固然很好；西端則還是尹綫明瞭。以此做基礎，再提據央中自己所說的「緬甸曾經管理江東之地，直至恩梅開江，及邁立開江匯流處。」責他界綫旣正於兩江滙流處，足見匯流處以北的地方，都非緬境，絕對不能退讓，江以西更小必說。能達到此目的，從前薛使請以邁立開恩梅開二江分水嶺為界之說，當然無形取銷。幸而中英　次議界，沒有訂定任何條約，還可據理力爭；否則為條約所束縛，即地爲了已。成事實，不能再有發言餘</p>
<p>以前薛便對外交方面，不可說他全不努力；只因一誤於邊疆地理不甚熟悉，一誤於國力方面不能與人抗爭，要想以口舌爭勝，收效當然很徵了。現我國自抗建以來，國際地位已增高，中英近又同站在民治陣綫上，利害相關，邦交已非常密切，大非昔比。國內如有長於應變的外交家，再輔以熱悉邊疆地理的人才，對界務自然洞若觀火，胸有成竹，一切無所牽掣，可盡量交涉，困難自迎刃而解。所以此次的劃界，可以說開始得到了光明的路綫，認定道路綫不斷的努力，自可達到光明大道。（續完）</p>

<h3>廣帮採辦雜牌紗　雙馬重出三千元關</h3>
<p>上日回下之紗市昨則又復轉昻、此因黃金回漲、人心良好、同時廠方减工日見劇烈、雙馬出數逐步下减、所以有一部份大戶心思逢低仍進也、二十支雙馬廠單晨開因上日午後人心不佳、大眾傾向看疲、賣意較濃、首盤價為二千九百四十元、比上日跌八十五元、少頃徵降至二千九百二十五元、然低盤一現、空頭急思扒補、氣勢突然轉挺、同時黄金又復報漲、於是買者紛紛而來、市盤乃節節前進、髙峰曾達三千零六十元、嗣後聞交換所雜紗等級已定奪、下週一當可恢復營業、由此空頭活躍、壓迫並施、收盤價爲三午零二十元、</p>
<p>雙馬交換所之等級表已發表節錄如下、二十支特金城相等品二三支金雞　加三十元又　大發　又二十元又　天女　减四十元又　雙地球　又一百十元二十支三星　又一百三十元又　五福　又一百三十元又　牧羊　又一百三十元</p>
<p>其他牌子大概减一百元外、最低减一百四十元、均係指定廠單可交、外棧不在此例、</p>
<p>現紗情形良好、趨勢續堅、蓋以廣幫突來收進二十支五福牧羊三星及三二支五福牧羊等紗、約計有三四百包之鉅、於是人心振作、買氣濃厚、有人說因日紗價奇硬、二十支上身紗價在三千一二百元之外、中身紗價亦在三千零四五十元之問、而根子頗緊也、不過近來棉花粗絨已見回鬆、據云目前紡織二十支紗之原料、每百斤價平均在八百元至八百五十元之間、紡紗一包需料三百五十斤、空方又有議論、太平洋風雲一緊、紗市將不穩也、查半日間成交統計七百包、行情漲五六十元之譜云、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况由激漲而略回、形勢突叉反硬、當晨間開出、先以廠單暗盤做開後逐步邁進、會做髙至三千零五十元以上、且因一般進戶有認國外之展望將別多、故多吸收、期紗開出、買戶突增、加以空方之扒補、一時塲中為買氣所節罩、十一月份開出已露上升之鋒、為一千八百三十元、上漲十元、入後經買方之拉提與空頭之扒補、一度高至二千九百二十元、適因金價上騰人心益形向上、十二月份竟以一二千一百元髙價開盤、突升一百三十三元、一月期為三千一百五十元、亦好九十六元夕多、入後徘徊、脚地尙挺、雖後以浮多脫手、稍為轉弱、但無若何趨疲之象、半日間起伏結果、一致回漲六十餘元至百餘兀不等、下午無市、玆列表於後、</p>

<p>紐約棉市、先因華爾街及同業買進而漲、繼因紐奧倫斯售出及多頭了結稍跌、最後因現貨商買進及空頭抵補再漲、昨日收盤價格、較上日各漲十三至十七磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因空頭抵補而漲、續後又因遠東局勢甚屬緊張、及歐洲出口商售出而跌、結果昨日收盤價格、約漲二羅比左右、又預測今日開盤市況看漲一羅比、</p>
<p>另訊印棉經港轉滬、怡和洋行源牛輪昨日抵埠、由香港裝來棉花七百件、係印度出產、</p>
<h3>龍頭細布　欲漲反跌　取引所將改彩球為標準</h3>
<p>廠布　跌後回翔、乃以連日布價下游、引起買戶購意、惟以週末關係、成交仍淡、結果布價平平、一部份回漲每疋一元之譜、本街成交三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布欲漲反跌、形勢廻旋、龍頭細布廠單最髙盤喊一百十六七元、午收時降至一百十三元五角、四君子嗶嘰髙峯做四元○一二分、收盤為三元九角七分半、過程平靜、下午循例無市、聞取引所期布已定卜日復業開拍以彩球細布為標準、其等級表內以龍頭交貨者叉抬高七元半、</p>
<h3>呢絨裏襯　貨缺價貴</h3>
<p>呢絨裏襯類、近受原料絲紗之騰貴、各檔貨品莫不紛紛報漲、因本軍利薄、一般厰家出品大半延緩、亦有不顧名譽之廠家、因虧本而將前定開之定貨、不肯交割、目下西服幫因實銷當令、消化甚健市上絲光羽紗橡皮　　光緞光　緞　棕緞花洋布·軟襯·袋布·法西襯·黑炭襯之類、昨因貨缺而俏漲、大同絲光羽紗售四元半、華　橡皮緞八元、永成電光緞七元、昌明光明緞五元、聯新馬棕緞五元、洪盛花洋布四元八角、公平軟襯二元七角、源記盛法西襯一元六角、美泰黑炭襯九元半、</p>
<h3>在各方競購下　烚赤枯竭</h3>
<p>一小時半抬起一一五○元昨日現金烚赤暗市突復騰躍、已回出二萬元大關外、曾兩次再躍至二萬一千元外、照各方大心的不定、乃某某兩銀行買勢復濃、某證券號補空、香港幫亦有收吸、檯面籌碼複感枯竭、價由一萬九千九百元、飛上至二萬一千一百元、終為祥和、天元售出、當見回挫、終風軋升一千一百五十元、半日交易約七千兩、下午週六無市、飾金亦步升百元、達二千一百二十元、</p>
<p>現貨　出二萬元</p>
<p>烚赤現貨、晨九點開市、即在買風中抬高二百元、，為一萬九千九百元、俄在買勢中續昂、成記·德成·德孚祥興永·祥和·天元·大豐恒記·誠達·明豐傾進、賣戶觀望、價遂飛躍直上、竟步升一千一百五千元、哄至二萬一千零五十元、九點半後、大豐·祥和·祥興永復出合成·永成亦售、稍稍盤下、退至二萬零八百元、十點後大豐祥興永重父來進、德孚·順源收吸尤湧、竟一哄三百元、達二萬一千一百元、為成記祥和天元出售、小五百元、退至二萬零六百兀、德孚·祥和爭進、午收前哄上二百五十元、十點半收市二萬零八百五十元、比上日收價復猛漲一千一百五十元、收後二萬零八百元、有供無買戶、在一小時半營業內、有一千二百元上落、金號本牌金、門市售價二萬一千兀、收進在二萬元左右、飾金掛升一百元</p>

<h3>黑滙需要轉淡</h3>
<p>外　昨日市况、中央與滙豐兩掛牌未更、滙豐小櫃檯價呆定、英美滙黑黑市、尙屬穩定、非必需品進口商扒意甚淡、雖有美金二元六二五及二元七五華商有吐售、缺少對手、至十一點十分、由華商投機家售予殷富　千萬　、價為一九八七九市、英滙二　士切可結、美滙三元、與上日價同、下午週六無市香港八日（週穴）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩異常、申滙現貨獨升一元、為四百六十二元、餘無愛動、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津八日（週六）電、今晨酒市開盤吿平、倫敦及紐約　吿仍無變動、申滙升一元五角、為八十二元、聯鈔暗盤賤三元、為三十九元、</p>
<h3>日鮮票出四元關</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、英美金鎊　現金又漲三十元、英金票亦升一元、美金票又會昂至四十元、卒為三十九元七角、比上日回起四角、香港票則續趨低落、日金票及朝鮮票漲勢甚勁、前者髙至四元一角、後者升為四元、</p>
<h3>洋米外匯有着　米價之跌理所應然</h3>
<p>昨日洋米因平準基金會決定、每月供給最髙限度食米進口所需之外滙頭襯、計二十五萬包、總値國幣四千萬元、足數全市需求、兼途貨相繼湧到、租界當局又加嚴監視、汝謠詠不利多方、以致開市、無論大戶客囤及浮散等戶紛紛出籠、引成競脫之風、於是在乏人問津之下、各價一路直瀉、直迄收市、未稍抬頭、若一號西貢自百九十三元、跌至百八十八元，二號自百八十元跌至百七十五元、一號暹邏百八十一二元、百八十元、二號百七十元、法華尖百八十四五元、敏黨高自百八十元、次至百七十五元、小絞自百六十元、跌至百五十五六元、次百五十三四元、至百五十一元、碎尖目百三十六元、跌至百三十三四元、比前繼落三四五元不等、英華司現小絞髙自百九十三元半、次百八十元、後亦乏人問津成交二萬七千包又六百噸、</p>
<p>洋米大量不斷來滬、昨日　和洋行源生、明生兩輪同時到埠、均有洋米運來、源生輪由香港裝來洋米八千一百包、係工部局平價米、明生輪由香港裝來洋米一萬七千二百二十包、其中一萬零五百包、係工部局平價米、餘均客貨、兩輪停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、故米價之跌理所應然、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米市、本街店稍　難稱　、然以到貨不旺、貨主尙無輕售之意、結果僅隨洋米略見帶軟、計開南港早晚稻高自二百零五元、次至百九十八元、崑山新粳二百零六元、至二百零三元、靑角容種二百零五元、至二百元、杜尖百九十元、做開不多、洋糯因市貨已稀、脚地頗堅、故雖洋米回跌、尙堪支持、未見榮辱、續售港元高自二百二十二元、次至二百十八元、糯茶二百零四五元、國糯銷滯、未聞做開、</p>
<h3>粉市不支下瀉</h3>
<p>昨洋粉隨洋米下降、而實銷本化旣少、客　尤呆、蓋平價粉公　不久實現、而米跌與利空之謠均不利於大戶客囤、因此擭利浮戶首先求脫、大戶權起暗吐、市即不支下遊、金龍初開五十四元半、繼小半元、後貨主售價五十三元半尙乏進戶、故後市或須再見疲落云、</p>
<h3>雜糧實銷停頓</h3>
<p>雜糧黑市交易、昨尙平淡、實銷戶仍鮮進取、買戶態度咸星懈怠、故市勢繼續下趨、計開靑島生油價為三百九十二元、秦山廠菜油二百六十一元、天津金元一百二元、膠州黄豆一百零七元、崇明沙蠶六十一元、荷蘭黄苞米四十元至四十七元半、及白苞米四十七元至四十六元半、西貢新苞米五十九元半至五十九元、又十月份裝九十元零五角、及十一月份裝九十一元、</p>

<h3>顯有人操縱市面　烟白煤漲得兇</h3>
<p>烟白煤昨各行明市掛牌雖不動、但市塲暗盤、經囤戶儘量搜羅老棧單、市氣突高、行盤暴漲百餘元、鴻基白煤由七百八十元抬高至九百二十元、一號小子九百元、海峯白煤九百二十允、印度烟煤、出一千元大關、均開新紀錄、顯有人投機操縱市面、行家若一味囤住不出、本街門莊店零售、勢將斷檔云、</p>

<h3>栗（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>至遼史文學傳「蕭韓家奴典南京——今北平——栗園。重熙四年，……帝遼興宗——當從容問曰：「鄕居外有異聞乎？」對曰：「臣惟知炒栗；小者熟則大者必生，大者熟則小者必焦，必大小均熟始為盡美！」帝大笑。」這又是把那大小不等的栗子在鍋中翻炒的情形，描寫的多麼詳盡啊！不特此也，連我們現在所常說的「糖炒栗子」也有人淸楚的把它記錄下來哩！據明末淸初人嘉興周　的析津日記上說：「遼於南京置栗園司，……元昌平縣亦有栗園。……今燕京市肆，及秋，則以「餳」拌雜石子爆之。栗比南中差小而味頗甘，以「御栗」名，正不以大為貴也。」明末李時珍在本草綱目上把栗的吃食法總叙了一下說：「…栗…治腎一虛腰脚無力。以袋盛生栗，懸一乾，每旦吃十餘顆。……蓋風一乾之栗，勝於日曝，而火煨油炒，勝於蒸煮！……（完）</p>

<h3>美駐滬海軍陸戰隊　奉令作撤退準備　商團A字大隊明晚出防　華府命令含有重大意義　美軍駐滬十五年穩定治安厥功匪淺</h3>
<p>美國駐華海軍陸戰隊司令、聞已奉到華盛頓電令、準備立即撤退駐華陸戰隊、查美國在華駐軍、合計共九百七十名、計駐上海七百五十名、駐天津一百六十五名、駐北平五十五名、駐滬者為麥令斯第四聯隊、</p>
<p>世界局勢愈趨明瞭</p>
<p>蔣委員長於前日在渝發表談話、表示民治國家與中國必獲最後勝利、昨又消息傳來、美羅斯福總統命令撤退駐華海軍陸戰隊、値茲日方揚言進取滇緬路之時、遙相呼應、足可象徵遠東及世界局勢趨向所在、昨日本埠美國總領事館、美第四聯隊本部、及美長江艦隊司令部、對於華府撤退駐華軍隊一節、嚴守緘默、惟據關係官方聲稱、羅斯福宜佈考慮撒退駐華陸上軍隊、含有準備迎戰及在重開之美日談話中、採取堅强之立塲之意義、實際上美國在滬駐軍七百五十人、在目前情勢夕下、「法律與秩序」有賴其維持、尤以上海租界之情形為甚、</p>
<p>萬國商團準備出防</p>
<p>自去半英國駐軍撤退後、防區暫由萬國商團接防、而美麥令斯隊之仟務、因此更見重大、全滬人心、認美麥令斯隊對於防區內確盡其最大努力、而本埠夕得有如此良好景象者、亦惟此是賴、若一旦離去人心未免因之浮動、且為美自身權利着想、非至必要時、亦以暫綏撤退為宜、昨據可恃方面消息萬國商團A字大隊、已奉令於明日五時出防、其餘各隊、亦奉令須有半小時內隨時可以出動之準備、此事是否與美麥令斯撤退消息有關、無從知悉、</p>
<p>滬上外僑表示意見</p>
<p>本市美律師即工部局美董阿樂滿對此頃發表言論、據稱、美第四陸戰隊在上海頗有穩定情勢之影響、尤以際此時期為然、滬上主要英商、即英商會主席馬歇爾爵士亦稱、「吾人當然期望美陸戰隊留滬、然美政府如覺美兵必須撤退、則以世界現局而論、此舉實有理由」云、日人方面對美陸戰隊可能的撤離上海事、不發止式批評、惟日人之私人意見、為或將召回美軍一舉、可解釋華華府方面具有車大意義之政治姿態、而信此舉與近在遠東所發任何「威脅」無關、但係美國將在太平洋可能的行動之徵象、又據某證券經紀人稱﹑衆業公所今晨休業、至星期一日開市時、料將感受反響、但美軍擬撤退、久在意料之中、母庸驚異</p>
<p>來滬駐防已十五年</p>

<h3>怎樣紀念國父誕辰</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>過兩天——十一月十二日，是我們的國父誕生的日子，所以各學校都放一天學，還要舉行一個隆重的儀式。</p>
<p>國父首創革命，領導許多革命志士，艱難困苦地奮鬥了四十年，才有中華民國的建立。所以他的誕辰，可以說就是國家的誕辰。他一生的喊史，也就是國家誕生的歷史。</p>
<p>現在，我們紀念國父的誕辰，應該學督他革命的精神：他致力革命，不怕困難，不畏艱險，四十年如一日，先後失敗了十次，一些也不灰心，仍然繼續不斷地奮門，到底專制的滿淸被推翻了，民國成立了。他那種不屈不撓的精神，百折不回的勇氣，是値得我們敬佩而摹倣的。</p>
<p>我們紀念國父的誕辰，還要學習他愛國的精神他為了祖國的自由，平等，呼籲奔走，竭盡心力，一直到逝世的最後一分鐘，還竭力地喊着·「和平！奮鬥！救中國！」這樣熱愛國家的精神神，是我們必須效法的。尤其現在國難這樣嚴重的時期，小朋友們應該怎樣學着他的精神，去奮鬥建國？</p>
<p>我們紀念國父的誕辰，更要學習他好學的精神：他最喜歡讀書，在火錢上督戰，身邊還帶着書籍。所以他能够著述許多書，如三民主義，建國方略，建國大綱等，指示我們怎樣去救國和建國。他時常對人說：「我一生除革命之外，只有讀書是嗜好，一天不讀書，便不能生活。」我們現在正在讀書的小朋友，應該怎樣惕勵自己，而效法我們的國父呢？</p>
<h3>怎樣孝親</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在世風日下的今日，孝親的確是個値得討論的問題。一般做兒子的人不要說孝親，甚至不把父母看在眼裏。而民把父母毆打的也不希罕，　幾句還是小事哩。</p>
<p>這次八仙橋靑年會，為提倡孝親起見，會舉行過一次孝親週，並向各校學生徵文。所出的題目，是「怎樣孝親？」和「我的父母。」本來我也想着令我敎的班子裏的同學參加，但因為時間關係，就此作罷。</p>
<p>不過事後我依舊在作文課上，把上面兩個題目出了叫他們做。三十幾個同學，揀「怎樣孝親」一題做的竟佔一二分之二以上。我批閱過卷子後，覺得他們的意見，可歸納如下：</p>
<p>要聽父母的話，不要那逆他們而使他們不快。</p>
<p>用功讀書，成績一好，可使父母樂意。</p>
<p>父母有不愜意的事，應得去勸解和安慰。</p>
<p>在這非常時期，一切用費要節省，應知父母得到錢的不易。</p>
<p>父母有病，要親為煮藥，常去慰問。</p>
<p>好吧，在求學時代，祇是消費，不會賺錢，所謂奉養，當然談不到。但能够做到上面幾點，也可算是孝親了吧？</p>
<h3>最偉大的美麗</h3>
<p>— 鈕惠人</p>
<p>「什麼是最美麗？」我想，提出了這一個問題，小朋友的答案一定很多。紅黄的菊花是最美麗啦，或是紅於二月花的楓葉是最美麗啦，或是五彩繽紛的熱帶魚最美麗啦，……對嗎？那一個說的最對？不對，我認為都小對。那末，小朋友一定要驚異地問：「什麼才是最美麗？」</p>
<p>聽吧，美麗有二種，一種是形色的美，一種是精神的美。普通說的美，花，月，蟲，鳥的美，便是形式的美。那是表面的美，暫時的美，是渺小的很，嚴格說來，實在算不得美。眞的美，便是精神的美——愛。法國少女貞德愛國家，犧牲了自己，去領導國民抗敵，終於挽救了國家的危亡，伊的愛，是多麽偉大的美麗！南丁格蘭愛人類，冒着槍林彈雨的危險，去戰塲為傷兵看護，建立了看護制度，使此後全世界的傷兵，病人得到慰藉，伊的愛，又是多麽偉大的美麗！</p>
<p>記住吧，世界上最美麗是「愛」，愛是最眞純的美，最永久的美，你們心中都各有一個愛，願你們愛你們的爸媽，愛一你們的社會，愛你們的國家，愛整個的人類，建立你們最偉大的美麗！</p>
<h3>蜘蛛和蝴蝶</h3>
<p>— 葉斐</p>
<p>一隻蜘蛛，在樹上吐絲結網，可是因為風太大了，結了好久，總結不好，但是它亳不灰心，只顧一心一意地結。</p>
<p>它的朋友蝴蝶，飛來對它說：「蜘蛛兄，你太傻了，風這樣大，任憑你有多大本領，也不會給你結好的，還是同我去玩罷！」</p>
<p>可是蜘蛛郤抱定了非做好不玩的宗旨，他回答蝴蝶說：一蝴蝶妹，結網是我的資任，我一定要結好它，風雖然大，可是我不怕，我有力氣可以掙扎。像你穿得花花綠綠，整大東蕩蕩，西玩玩，過的生活有什麼意思呢？」說完繼續結它的網了，……很堅決，便失望地飛去了。</p>
<p>風漸漸小了，蜘蛛也把網結好了，安閒地端在綱的中間。</p>
<p>蝴蝶又來了，它望見了蜘蛛，驚奇地說：「蜘蛛兄，你眞能幹，竟給你結成功了。」</p>
<p>蜘蛛卻淡淡地回答說：「蝴蝶妹，你年幼不知道，我吿訴你吧：這不是我的能幹，而是我有忍耐心，凡　只要肯忍耐。不要因初次的挫折而灰心，初次失敗了，還有第二次；第二次失敗了，還有第三次……百折不撓的做下去，總有一次會成功的。所以忍耐是成功的基礎！」</p>
<p>蝴蝶聽了蜘蛛的話，很感動，飛去作事去了。</p>
<p>所以，諸位小朋友，你們做事總要忍耐，上面所說的那隻蜘蛛，便是你們作事的好模範：</p>
<h3>第一次月考</h3>
<p>— 胡德培</p>
<p>忙忙碌碌的月考，已在今日一古腦兒的結束了。成績如何，還沒有詳細知道。</p>
<p>記得在未考之前，心中常掛念着月考，因此面上總帶着恐懼的色彩，一若大禍將臨，把整日所有的時間，都用在書本上，準備考試。</p>
<p>臨考時，先生們都很認眞，出了許多難題，叫我們費盡心血，絞盡腦汁，埋頭做去。時間是規定只有四十分鐘一次，過了時間，再也不容讓我們遷延片刻；並且把各人的坐位統統掉換，免得作弊。先生為提高我們的學業程度計，眞是無微不至。</p>
<p>現在已經考完了，多日的恐慌心理，從此烟消雲散，多快樂呀！然而一轉瞬間，第二次月考，又將接踵而來，我們該怎樣努力！</p>
<h3>衣服（中）</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>當在發生新陳代謝作用的時候，便產生了很多的熱理量，因此我們身上都是熱的，若是少穿了衣服熱量傳到身體，上，而向身體四周的空氣散失掉，你更會覺得冷了，所以一到了天氣冷的時候，就多穿幾件衣服，這衣服好像是一層牆壁把你身體上發出來的熱量阻擋住了，不讓它們散失，而都保藏在你身體的四周，這樣你就覺得溫暖得多。衣服中要算是羊毛織的最暖，這因為羊毛織的絨綫衫，是很疏鬆的，着在身上，它便有很多空的地位，來保藏身體上發出來的熱，冬天所以要穿棉袍子，或是為這個道理啊！你有沒有看見過媽媽把冬天穿的衣服時常晒太陽，再用藤拍在太陽下打拍，這是什麼道理？……</p>
<p>「這我　得的，因為衣服裏常有蛀壞衣服的蛀蟲躱着，晒在太陽裏便可把它們晒死，而用藤拍拍打，這是把躱在衣服內層的蛀蟲嚇出來，便可一一的晒死了，衣服就不會再蛀壞了。」阿亮搶着說。</p>
<p>「一些也不錯，不過還有一層道理？拍打旣可以把衣服上的灰塵拍去，並且又可以使衣服內層拍打得很疏鬆，因為它們是一向壓在箱子裏，壓得很結實，冬天穿起來，便不覺得十分的溫暖，這樣一經打拍，衣服內層旣可疏鬆，裏面又可以有許多空隙來保藏身體的熱氣了。這也是同樣的原因啊！」</p>
<p>阿亮的爸爸說完了這許多話，要同着他母親出去買一些冬季的衣料，阿亮嚷着也要去，反正今天是星期日，帶着他去吧。於是他們搭了一輛電車向熱鬧的中心駛去，不到半個鐘頭，他們便踏進了一　三開間門面的布店。</p>
<p>「今年的衣料眞貴得不得了，這件假羊毛的也要幾十塊錢哩。」當他們僅僅　了一件衣料便走了出來，他爸爸這樣咕噥着，他本來想多買幾件，可是那裏知道所帶出來的錢，買一件好的衣料尚覺勉強，因此擇了一件價錢差不多的衣料就算了。阿亮做新衣服的念頭，也變成了一個泡影。他們重又踏上了電車，回到家裏。</p>

<h3>「思凡」中的羅漢處置</h3>
<p>— 華羽</p>
<p>崑曲孽海記的思凡，是一齣獨角戲，雖是一個人在台上表演，但韻味淸逸，質而不俚，聲調柔麗和曼，音節圓勁輕靈。這一個色空尼姑的表演，動作的繁細，姿勢的優美，儘多關捩奧竅之處，備極錯綜變化之妙。要沒有十二分功候的，唱做都難恰到好處。所以須要儀態萬方，舉止有節，才為妙品。</p>
<p>我所看到的思凡，有梅蘭芳，程硯秋，朱傳茗，韓世昌，以及海上女票徐老太太，內外行次數當在十餘次，都使我有相當的滿意。可知崑曲戲的可貴，雖然有幾個不過是繞塲疾趨，矜持作勢，張袖彿塵，作旋風舞，面部神色，匆遽如奔流急湍，那都是野狐禪，不足為準。</p>
<p>凡飾色空的，必須工夫純正，姿態圓熟，表現色相，穠纖適中，演繹劇情，樂而不縱，水袖的騰挪跌宕，塵尾的控縱抑揚，均須於徐疾之間，能應節合拍，容似正而神行，眉欲飛而色舞。尤須於天機活潑中，仍能保持其不雕琢的眞善美，方臻妙境。</p>
<p>在表演唱「山坡羊二段「小尼姑年方二八……且顧眼下，」在此時表演的一切動作，須如春雲出岫。流水回環，以不為迹象所泥為上乘。</p>
<p>於這一段的表演必要將獨居的色空，禪關深鎖，綺思澎湃，覺悟到人生都是空虛，靈犀一點，油然激起，不可遏即，「只見那活人受罪，那會見那死鬼帶枷」，「平白的與那地府陰司做功課」，決心逃避，因此由經堂而兩廊，而山門，神情意念，步步緊張，逃下山去的步伐，正是翩若驚鴻，翔如飛燕，賞具有宜僚弄丸，公孫舞劍之妙。</p>
<p>在羅漢堂中，粉墨扮演，備諸色相，五光十色，與舞袖歌衫相映輝，排塲點綴，自不可少。不過小尼姑下了山，羅漢依然森列，在這一點上應該考慮。我的意思，在演唱……那　眉大仙愁着我，說我老來時有什麼結果……做不得玳筵東閣……」在這段唱完作舉步出山狀，應一面合攏台幕。台幕攏合後，好使羅漢下塲，色空再接唱奴把袈裟扯破……」脫去袈裟，賡演下山。至於下山的小和尙，我看過華傳浩的，實在再找不出第二個人了，據說他是學陸壽卿的路子。</p>

<h3>General Chiang Kai-shek States China Will Take the Initiative in the War Against Japan, China Has Become the Defense Front Line for Pacific Nations, All Democratic Countries Must Intensify Cooperation to Strive for Victory</h3>
<p>Chongqing - General Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang received reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies stationed in Chongqing at their private residence at 5 PM on the 7th. They were accompanied by Dong Xianguang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Propaganda, and Ke Ji-ze, Shen Jiancun, Tang Dechen, Director of the English Department of the Central News Agency, and others from the International Propaganda Department. Among those present were Stu Lei-lun of the Chicago Daily News and Mao Na, MacDonald and Smith of the London Times, Woodworth of the London News Chronicle, Gan Lisheng of the North American Newspaper Alliance, Shi Runsheng of the New York Herald Tribune, Deng William of Columbia Broadcasting System, Shi Fumen of the National Broadcasting Company of America, MacDonald of the Sydney Morning Herald, Shi Yin of the Manchester Guardian, Stuart Hua of Time Magazine, Wei Di-mu of the American United Relief for Chinese Refugees Committee, Liu Jia-lu of Fox Film Corporation, Zhao Minheng of Reuters, Lian Sha and Bai Chen-ge of the Associated Press, Fei Si, Wang Gongda, and Ge Lan-hen of the United Press, Nuo Mi-luo-ci-ji and Ye Xia-ming of TASS, Bai De-en You Jiang Bo-jing of the International News Service, Pan Shao-ang of Havas, Gan Ping of the Swiss National Daily, etc. General Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech on the spot, which was translated into English by Deputy Minister Dong section by section. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Yesterday afternoon, General Chiang Kai-shek specially received foreign visitors and expressed his belief in the ultimate victory of all democratic countries and China, and especially praised the three countries of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for the role they played in this war against aggression. The General stated that the aggressors are intensifying their aggression, causing the war against aggression to reach a severe time, but at present, there is a sign of historical solidarity among the countries resisting aggression. Therefore, all democratic countries must redouble their efforts to cooperate closely and strive for the final victory. Regarding the war in China, the General said that the initiative will soon belong to our side, and this statement will be proven by facts. At that time, I will meet with you again. The visitors said that the weather in Chongqing was unpleasant and jokingly asked whether the General would improve the weather. The General replied, "Yes, we will return to Nanjing, where the weather is better." Madame Chiang, who was also present, said, "We will also go to Beiping, where the weather is historically good." The General also stated that the military and economic missions of friendly nations are now working in China in factories, armies, and financial and economic institutions in the rear and at the front, and serving along transportation lines, which shows that democratic countries are jointly working to overthrow the aggressors. Today's China has become a front line outside the Chinese border, especially a part of the defense front line of the Pacific nations. The General especially praised Britain, saying that although Britain was outnumbered, it still bravely defended Britain, fought bloody battles in Norway, Greece, Crete, and Libya, and assisted the invaded countries. The General also praised the United States for supplying all democratic countries with weapons and materials, and then said that the heroic resistance of the Soviet Union exceeded all expectations. The General then proposed a toast to the victory of the Soviet Union (the General personally attended the reception at the Soviet Embassy yesterday morning). The General continued that the war will reform human thoughts and ways of life, and it is expected that after the war, all countries will make the final contribution to world peace and prosperity, and will not allow aggressors to gain a foothold in the world. The General received the visitors in a spacious reception room with great energy and vigor, sitting on a sofa chair with Madame Chiang sitting beside him. The General recited a pre-prepared statement, but often inserted impromptu words. An American female visitor offered refreshments, and the General said in English, "Thank you, thank you very much." The General and his wife shook hands and chatted with each visitor, casually, but did not make formal remarks. The General recalled that he had received foreign visitors many times before, and expressed particular concern for visitors who had visited the Chinese military front, repeatedly stating that any foreign visitors who wanted to visit the front would be provided with convenience. Of all the receptions for journalists held by the General, yesterday's was probably the largest in scope, with representatives from British, American, and Soviet newspapers, news agencies, broadcasting companies, magazines, and newly opened photography agencies, totaling thirty people. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, General Chiang Kai-shek received foreign reporters at his official residence, with Madame Chiang also present. After refreshments were served, he expressed his views on the current development of the war and the changes in the world after the war, which were translated by Dong Xianguang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda. General Chiang Kai-shek believes that based on the various signs of the current evolution, after mankind has deeply tasted the pain of aggressive warfare, there will inevitably be fundamental changes in thought and life in the future. All aggressive forces must not continue to exist, and mankind must help each other with the Christian spirit of love. Therefore, he firmly believes that true human equality and world peace will be realized because mankind understands justice. Regarding the current situation, General Chiang Kai-shek said that the unity and struggle of the anti-aggression countries is entering an important period, and the war of resistance in both the East and the West is developing at a high level, but the initiative is still in the hands of the aggressors, who are launching a second wave of attacks against democratic countries. Therefore, democratic countries should unite more closely and strengthen their defenses. China has been resisting aggression for more than four years and deeply understands the necessity of close coordination on all fronts and knows that the future counter-offensive will depend on the degree of unity in the world. The military and economic delegations of friendly nations are now working hard in the front and rear of China. This move has already established the best foundation for unity, and the benefits of unity are now obvious. In some respects, it has made the aggressors hesitate, as if trapped in a quagmire. From this, it can be believed that the initiative will soon be in our hands, and it is expected that facts can prove it one day. At that time, we will discuss it with you. The above is the main part of General Chiang Kai-shek's speech. At the beginning of his speech, he said in the most cordial attitude and tone that because of the busy military affairs, he could not meet with you often. Today, taking this opportunity, we can talk casually. Many of those present are also overseas Chinese from countries that have been invaded, and their compatriots are also engaged in the war of resistance like China, so they are our comrades. Although the United States has not participated in the war, it has provided great assistance to the invaded, so it can also be regarded as a comrade. General Chiang asked the reporters if they felt anything was wrong in Chongqing. Everyone said they were satisfied with everything, but one reporter said jokingly, can the weather be changed? General Chiang Kai-shek smiled and replied, when we return to Nanjing next year, the weather will be like that. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to reporters who participated in the tea party held by General Chiang Kai-shek at his private residence, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the spirit and health of General Chiang Kai-shek seen this time are the best. This is the third time since the Sino-Japanese War that the General and his wife have hosted a family tea party for journalists, and this is the second time it has been held in Chongqing. The reporters gathered in a comfortable place, with charcoal fire in the room. One reporter said that General Chiang Kai-shek's speech at the tea party could be called China's first fireside chat. Madame Chiang smiled and said, "No, this is a charcoal fire chat." (United Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>Yu Junxian Discusses the General Situation of Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Yu Junxian, member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department, went abroad in June this year to inspect overseas Chinese education in Macau, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and Burma, which lasted eight months, and recently returned to Chongqing. According to his talk, the impression of this inspection was very good. In recent years, overseas Chinese education has made considerable progress in both quality and quantity. In particular, the ambition of overseas Chinese youth is vigorous, and they are working hard to study and prepare to serve the motherland, which is admirable. Overseas Chinese education in Australia is relatively backward, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has allocated funds to subsidize the establishment of overseas Chinese schools. Two schools can be opened in the spring of next year, and preparations are underway. Overseas Chinese newspapers in various places are also very developed. People in various places donate money and gold to comfort the soldiers, which is very admirable. (8th dispatch)</p>

<h3>US President Announces to the Press Consideration of Withdrawing Troops Stationed in China, a Move to Strengthen the Bargaining Position in Negotiations with Japan and at the Same Time Prepare the Navy for War</h3>
<p>United Press, 8th, Washington Urgent Dispatch - It was learned here today that the commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in China has been ordered to prepare for the immediate withdrawal of the Marine Corps stationed in China. It is learned that the order was issued by President Roosevelt yesterday when he announced at a reception for the press that he was considering withdrawing the US Marine Corps in China. According to naval authorities, there are only 970 Marines stationed in China, 750 of whom are stationed in Shanghai, 165 in Tianjin, and 55 in Beiping.</p>
<p>United Press, 8th, Washington Dispatch - Last night, reliable sources here said that President Roosevelt's announcement that the US Fourth Marine Regiment may withdraw from China is obviously intended to strengthen the US's bargaining position in future negotiations with Japan. Observers also said that the small military force currently in China will become a suicidal army in the event of war. Secretary of State Hull refused to specifically comment on McKinley's order to withdraw troops, but he recalled that the State Department had repeatedly advised American citizens to withdraw from China. Hull's words were in response to the question of whether McKinley's order to withdraw troops was related to overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>United Press, 8th, Washington Dispatch - After President Roosevelt announced that the US Fourth Marine Regiment may withdraw from China, non-official circles here believe that it is an implication of a warning about possible developments between the US and Japan. This speculation is based on the fact that the Marine Corps in China is only a symbolic army and will be in a dangerous position in the event of an incident. This announcement is obviously a new warning to advise American citizens to leave China. However, some Japanese sources here said that this announcement may be an auspicious omen, because the Japanese side recently proposed recalling the Marine Corps as a gesture of improving relations. On the other hand, President Roosevelt specifically stated that this issue was not mentioned in the US-Japan negotiations. Therefore, it is unclear whether President Roosevelt's or the Japanese side's information is erroneous. President Roosevelt's use of the words "on shore" obviously meant that there was some important significance, or it implied that the Marine Corps would remain on warships, possibly staying in Asian waters. After President Roosevelt issued this announcement, he refused to speculate on when a definite decision would be made, only saying that he was "considering" withdrawing the Marine Corps in China. The President refused to answer questions on this issue. He specifically stated that Japan and the United States had not discussed the withdrawal of the Marine Corps. He said that he did not know whether the consideration of withdrawing the Marine Corps would affect the territorial issue in the Sino-Japanese War. He said that he did not know the number of Marine Corps and overseas Chinese in the Far East, but he recalled that the overseas Chinese there had been repeatedly advised to return to their country.</p>
<p>The United States Will Not Budge on Japan's Aggression Against China</p>
<p>Reuters, 8th, Washington Dispatch - Qualified observers here believe that President Roosevelt's statement that the government is now considering withdrawing the Marine Corps in China is a psychological effect and also to prevent possible unpleasant incidents. Some people also believe that this announcement can have the same effect as the withdrawal of American citizens from Japan a few months ago in awakening Japan, as it is also an action to remove obstacles to deal with Japan. The anti-American remarks recently published in Japanese newspapers have made public opinion here increasingly strong, which can be seen in the words of President McKinley's speech on Thursday night praising China's resistance against Japan, such as China's social progress being destroyed by barbarism. However, well-informed observers believe that the visit of Japanese special envoy Kurusu is proof that Japan is eager to reach a compromise with the United States, because Japan is now gradually feeling the pain of American economic pressure. It is now known that the US position has not changed, and it is still based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the published obligations to China and to Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies in the Pacific. This position will never allow for any retreat on the recognition of Japan's decade-long aggression. Therefore, whatever price Japan is willing to pay in exchange for American friendship and stability in the Pacific region is only for Japan to decide. If Kurusu comes to the United States hoping to make a tough compromise, then he will encounter failure, and after the failure of the negotiations, Japan seems to be adopting the method that Tokyo newspapers have recently threatened the United States with. The Washington military community has long held the view that the American troops in China should be greatly increased or completely withdrawn. According to recent naval records, there were a total of 1,500 American sailors stationed in China six months ago. The sailors in Beiping were guards of the embassy, while the American troops in Tianjin and Shanghai have been greatly reduced since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. As for the Yangtze River and other places, there are several small American gunboats, but the American President did not mention you. According to recent estimates, there are fewer than 5,000 Americans living in China.</p>
<p>Havas, 7th, Washington Dispatch - President Roosevelt's announcement that the United States is now considering withdrawing the Marine Corps in China was foreseen by naval circles months ago. Therefore, there is no surprise about this matter.</p>
<p>United Press, 7th, Military Celebration Dispatch - Officials remain silent regarding the US consideration of withdrawing the Marine Corps stationed in China. They generally pointed out that Washington knows what is best, but some people also lamented that this move may be interpreted as a gesture of making peace with Japan, especially at this time.</p>
<h3>US Senate Approves Merchant Ships Entering War Zones, to Be Implemented Immediately Upon Passage by the House of Representatives, US Establishes Naval Base in Iceland</h3>
<p>Reuters, 8th, Washington Dispatch - After a fierce debate yesterday, the Senate passed a bill by a vote of 50 to 37 to allow US merchant ships to be armed and to allow US merchant ships to enter the ports and war zones of belligerent countries. The bill will be sent to the House of Representatives for reconsideration, because the House of Representatives previously passed only the item of arming merchant ships by a vote of 259 to 13. Government leaders believe that the House of Representatives will definitely approve the Senate's amendments by a majority vote, and action will be taken around Wednesday. If the result is satisfactory, then this bill can be sent directly to the White House for the President to sign into law. When the Senate debated this bill, the atmosphere was very tense, which was rare in the past. Not only was there no empty seat in the meeting hall, but the audience seats were also very crowded. The voting was quite chaotic, and Vice President Wallace repeatedly urged to pay attention to order. There were three votes. The first vote was 49 to 38 to allow US ships to enter the ports and war zones of belligerent countries. The second vote was 50 to 38 to accept the Foreign Affairs Committee's amendment to allow US ships to be armed and to enter the ports of belligerent countries. The third vote was 50 to 37 to allow US ships to be armed and to allow US merchant ships to enter the ports and war zones of belligerent countries. Thus, the original texts of the first and second of the Neutrality Act were cancelled. This can be regarded as President Roosevelt's greatest success in the Senate. Radio commentators said that US merchant ships can now sail to any port in the world and carry American arms to supply Central Asia. In other words, British and American merchant ships and warships will engage in the war in the Atlantic from now on. The Senate's decision undoubtedly represents the will of the majority of the American people, and this decision will bring the United States closer to participating in the war.</p>
<p>Havas, 8th, Washington Dispatch - The Senate's passage of the Neutrality Act amendment is an unprecedented victory for the government, because the United States can formally abandon isolationism from now on and restore its traditional policy of freedom of the seas.</p>
<p>United Press, 8th, Washington Dispatch - Sea Chief Knox said that the US Navy has established an operational base in Iceland, with Rear Admiral Huffman as commander, under the command of the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet.</p>
<p>US Railway Workers Brew General Strike</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 8th, Washington Dispatch - It was learned last night that the chairmen of the five railway worker unions in the United States announced that a general strike would be held on December 5. This matter was decided after the failure of the arbitration meeting. The members of the association, designated by President Roosevelt, had given the workers wage increases ranging from 7.5% to 13.5%. The general strike was originally scheduled for September 5, but was postponed to after the arbitration meeting after mediation by Weissford.</p>
<h3>Kurusu Left the Philippines Yesterday, Flew to Honolulu to Transfer to the United States, Tokyo Newspapers Unanimously Criticize the Conclusion of US-Japan Talks, Saying It Cannot Be Overly Optimistic</h3>
<p>United Press, 8th, Manila Dispatch - Japanese special envoy to the United States, Kurusu, took a Pan American Clipper this morning to Honolulu to transfer to the United States. His trip is to participate in Ambassador Nomura's US-Japan talks to avoid the crisis in the Pacific.</p>
<p>United Press, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch - The only Japanese newspaper in Tokyo to comment on Kurusu's visit to the United States today, the Miyako Shimbun, reiterated that unless the United States "completely changes its attitude," this mission will fail. The Miyako Shimbun said that Japan is resolutely and calmly watching the development of the situation.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch - Yesterday, the newspapers here commented on Japan's dispatch of Kurusu to the United States as a special advisor to the embassy. Yesterday afternoon's newspapers concluded that it should not be overly optimistic about this matter. The Yomiuri Shimbun said, "We will wait silently for the results of his final efforts." The Mainichi Shimbun doubted that the dispatch of Kurusu to the United States would improve the opportunity for US-Japan meetings. It is very dangerous to be optimistic in this situation. Kurusu's appointment proves Japan's sincere efforts to maintain peace in the Pacific, and also proves that Japan's foreign policy has not changed. The Kokumin Shimbun made a stern comment, saying that Japan's policy will not change due to Kurusu's visit to the United States, but will be even more firmly established than before. This should be noted by the United States and its allies. It is also something that Japan cannot forget. If the United States believes that the encirclement policy is enough to make Japan abandon its established policy, it is a fallacy. If the United States experiences this opportunity to maintain peace in the Pacific and achieves a satisfactory solution, then the United States will benefit more than Japan.</p>
<h3>Personnel Coming to China to Serve to Organize International Air Force to Assist China in Defending the Burma Road and Britain Re-Deploys Far East Defenses</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - Sources say that intelligence circles do not dismiss the possibility hinted at by the Japanese newspaper *Hiroshima Times* that Japanese troops will head directly to Yunnan Province. It is believed that opinions are being exchanged between the United Kingdom and its Dominions. The *New Statesman* discusses the status of the Pacific, stating that it is unsurprising that Japan continues to attempt to blockade the Burma Road and intensify the blockade of China through diplomatic means to prevent American supplies. Although high mountains and dense forests may be a formidable obstacle to the Japanese army's advance, the outcome of the war also depends on the strength of the air force. Therefore, the capitals of the United Kingdom are carefully considering plans to replenish the Chinese Air Force. According to news from Washington, the idea of the United States taking over the maintenance of the Burma Road is under consideration. Furthermore, diplomatic correspondents report that China's ability to defend this road largely depends on the air force. Therefore, all possible steps to increase international aid to the Chinese Air Force will be taken. This international air force will be composed of personnel from various countries who sympathize with China's war. Although Japanese envoy Kurusu is currently flying to the United States for mediation, news from Washington is pessimistic about the US-Japan negotiations. The *Times* correspondent in Washington reports that the US Secretary of the Navy stated that a conflict with Japan in the Pacific, while not inevitable, seems imminent. If Japan insists that the United States abandon its well-known obligations in China and the South Pacific, the United States will refuse, regardless of the cost. Another message from Washington states that unless Japan drastically changes its policy, no matter how many final proposals it makes or how many negotiators it sends to Washington, it will inevitably fail. Therefore, the British Empire is now doing its best to strengthen its defenses in the Far East, regardless of the progress of the talks in Washington. According to a dispatch from Singapore, a large convoy carrying reinforcements has arrived there, and the British Empire is now re-planning its defenses in the Pacific. This is probably related to the visit of Indian Commander-in-Chief General Wavell to the Far East. General Wavell promised to have the Indian Army cooperate more closely with Singapore and continue to send reinforcements. The British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Brooke-Popham, is taking certain steps, such as abandoning the scorched earth policy for some isolated British outposts in the Pacific. Previously, it was believed that these outposts could not be defended for long, but now it has been decided to build one of the important outposts as a fortress in the Pacific defense line.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom Should Defend the Lifelines of China and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 8th - The *Singapore Free Press* discusses the overall situation in the Far East, stating that the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands should form a clear alliance. It states that Vladivostok and the Burma Road are of utmost importance and must be defended by the United Kingdom. Other important places include Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies. The reason why the United Kingdom must defend Vladivostok is that the Soviet Union relies on it to transport supplies during its war in Europe, and Siberia can directly threaten the heart of Japan. The reason why the Burma Road must be defended is that it is China's lifeline, without which China may not be able to fight for long and achieve victory. The article states that there is no doubt that all of the above locations must be defended if attacked. The political circles refused to comment on the question of whether one or several of the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands would go to war if Vladivostok or the Burma Road were attacked. While acknowledging that such an attack would greatly change the situation in the Far East and would be a matter of concern for all free nations, it stated that any decision to take military action outside the borders of the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands involves important political considerations. Such important political issues, even if they involve purely strategic issues, cannot be decided by local personnel and must be decided by the domestic government.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 8th - The Air Ministry announced yesterday that the American-made "Brewster Buffalo" aircraft driven by the Royal Air Force in Malaya "are sufficient to defeat any enemy that may be encountered in the Far East."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 8th - Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the Swedish capital's radio report that American troops had gone to Yunnan and Burma was just another of Germany's propaganda tactics. He said that the absurdity of the German reports meant that the reports issued by Berlin's propaganda machine would soon not be believed by the public.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>"Striving for Victory Through Close Cooperation"</h3>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek, in an interview with foreign reporters the day before yesterday, strongly emphasized the obvious benefits of mutual solidarity among the free nations, and stated that even greater efforts should be made in the future to strive for final victory through close cooperation. This, along with President Roosevelt's statement the day before yesterday, that "the heroic stand of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union will receive the full support of the free people of the Americas," and that "the United States must supply China, Britain, and the Soviet Union with armaments, and must do so today," can be said to have the same purpose and coincide without prior consultation. At this point in time, if we want to suppress the arrogance of the aggressive front and prevent the expansion of aggressive disasters, it can be said that no single country has the assurance of winning alone except for the combined efforts of all freedom-loving countries in the world. China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are fighting separately, which is related to the survival of the nation, and of course, no more slackness is allowed. Even in the United States, although it has not officially participated in the war, it has in fact long become the future target of aggressors, so it must also fully assist its comrades to avoid the danger of shared destruction. Based on this simple reason of shared weal and woe and interconnected interests, it can be seen that President Chiang's optimism about the future of cooperation among the free nations and President Roosevelt's declaration of willingness to fully assist China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are not empty propaganda or intimidation tactics commonly used by the Axis countries, but facts that are true and credible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the aggressive front, although it has also felt the need to strengthen its collusion in order to echo each other from east to west and realize its so-called "joint action," but in essence, what they are doing is all unjust acts of murder and robbery. On the one hand, there are the benefits of cooperation, but on the other hand, there are also the risks of cooperation. In case of unsuccessful cooperation, it is easy to take the blame for others or suffer joint disaster. This is why Germany is eager for Japan to take action, but Japan is still putting on airs and does not dare to go deep. This is truly incomparable to the great spirit of wholeheartedness and eternal cooperation among the free nations.</p>
<p>Most ridiculously, Japan has always been evasive about its interpretation of Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact and refuses to make a positive statement. As a foreign observer said, the Tokyo government has avoided responsibility for this alliance at least twice: the first time was when Germany began its war against the Soviet Union and Japan took no action, and the second time was recently after the USS *Rubin James* incident, when Germany insisted that the United States attacked first, implying that Japan could invoke the alliance, but as a result, Japan remained deaf and dumb and showed the same retreat. From this, it can be seen that what Japan cares about is only its own interests, so what it promotes is only the so-called "independence and autonomy," an diplomacy that is not bound by the alliance. As of now, the only obligation it has fulfilled to its allies is limited to issuing some irresponsible tough slogans from time to time, or continuing to make some intimidating military preparations in the North and South Pacific. But in fact, what it is most concerned about now is still conducting diplomatic negotiations with the United States—that is, the enemy of its European allies. In order to make a "last effort," it even sent Kurusu, who once represented the Japanese government in signing the Tripartite Pact, to the United States to assist Nomura in handling these negotiations. In Hitler's mind, this should have aroused a somewhat different feeling.</p>
<p>Although Japan disregards the interests of its allies and is eager to reach a compromise with the United States alone, its ambition and shortsightedness have blinded it, preventing it from recognizing reality, preventing it from understanding that the free nations have long had a common position, and preventing it from seeing the bond of shared weal and woe among the free nations. According to the seven principles published in the *Hiroshima Times* the other day, what Japan hopes from the United States is not only to help it resolve the "China Incident," but also to recognize the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," so-called having both the fish and the bear's paw, all of which it desires. However, asking the United States to help resolve the China Incident is tantamount to asking the United States to sacrifice China. This is because Japan has overlooked the fact that China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have long been united. Asking the United States to recognize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is tantamount to asking the United States to withdraw from the Far East and abandon its consistent anti-aggression policy. This is again because Japan has forgotten the promises that President Roosevelt has repeatedly made to the free nations. Therefore, no matter how enthusiastic the Tokyo government is about negotiations, and no matter who it sends as a special envoy to the United States for mediation, as long as its fundamental policy does not change, it will never be able to obtain concrete results, and the greatest effect of continuing negotiations will be at most to delay the time.</p>
<p>However, judging from the clear and resolute statements of the leaders of the United States and China, it is not difficult for the world to imagine that even if Japan wants to delay the time in the future, it will probably be unable to shake the established situation of mutual solidarity among the free nations, and it will be even more impossible to ease the determination of the United States to step up its assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Not only will it be unable to do so, but perhaps President Chiang's prediction of "striving for victory through close cooperation" will eventually come true.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Will Set Up Preliminary Reviewing Agency for Foreign Exchange Applications; Organization is Somewhat Similar to the Kunming Exchange Equalization Association Branch, Aiming to Facilitate Shanghai Merchants</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to sources related to the government, in order to facilitate Shanghai merchants' applications for foreign exchange, the government will set up a preliminary reviewing agency in Shanghai. Its organization is somewhat similar to the Kunming Exchange Equalization Association Branch. (Havas News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange Resumes Trading in Legal Tender</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange closed in the morning yesterday, and resumed trading in legal tender in the afternoon, with black market trading at a price of HK$135 for 1,000 legal tender dollars. The order was good, the number of transactions was extremely large, and the price fluctuations were limited. Transactions were still as usual, and legal tender could be delivered if needed.

<h3>Dutch East Indies Expands Naval Base; New Surabaya Naval Port Has Been Completed and Torpedo Boats Are Being Built in Rapid Succession</h3>
<p>United Press, Surabaya, 8th - The area of ​​Surabaya's naval base has doubled in the last nine months. This is the Dutch effort to make the Dutch East Indies defense unbreakable. A brand new naval port has been built there, and a wharf about half a mile long is also under construction, which can accommodate several warships. A camp that can accommodate 25,000 soldiers is also nearing completion, and at least twelve new machine shops have been completed. In addition, the authorities are also building another naval port to accommodate small warships. At least the reporter did not see the above points when he came here nine months ago. No less than thousands of additional native workers participated in the work. Torpedo boats are being built in rapid succession, and mine-laying boats and patrol ships are also expected to be completed and launched quickly. Many cruisers and destroyers in the base are being re-equipped to enable the ships to exert greater power in defending the East Indies. There are many safe air-raid shelters. Every day from 6 am to 3 pm, the sound of the equipment working in the factories and machine rooms is deafening. Fast boats traveling 40 nautical miles per hour can be seen everywhere on the sea. This kind of torpedo speedboat has become a strong defensive weapon of the Dutch East Indies Navy. On Madura Island, opposite the Surabaya Sea, there are more naval ammunition factories, all built underground, with no danger of being destroyed. The dock is stationed with the latest submarines.</p>
<h3>Japanese Overseas Nationals Withdraw One After Another</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - A Japanese ship left Yokohama for Singapore yesterday to bring back Japanese nationals there. As for the withdrawal of foreigners from Japan, it is currently impossible.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - According to the *Nichi Nichi Shimbun*, the Japanese Consul-General in Yangon has requested the Japanese merchants in Myanmar to withdraw. At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that three Japanese ships sailed from Canada, the United States, and the Hawaiian Islands to Japan, carrying a total of 1,687 American and Japanese passengers.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Preparation Frenzy; Cannon Fire More Important Than Church Bells; Metals Collected from All Over the Country</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - In order to collect metals, the Japanese government stipulated that the temple's sacrificial bells, lanterns, and other metal objects must be melted down for national defense purposes. A professor at Tokyo Imperial University published an article in the *Asahi Shimbun*, admitting that the sound of cannon fire is more important than church bells today, but urged the government to pay attention to preserving items of historical and religious value.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Vietnamese Railroad Traffic Taken Over by Japanese; Vietnamese Authorities Deny</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Hanoi, Vietnam, 7th - The rumor that all road and railroad traffic lines in Vietnam have been taken over by the Japanese has been firmly denied by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Panama Repels Japanese; Japanese Protest Rejected</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 8th - The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Japan had filed a protest on the first of this month against Panama's discriminatory treatment of Japanese nationals, but was rejected. Therefore, the protest was filed again yesterday. He said that Panama has promulgated new laws restricting Japanese commercial and agricultural activities in Panama. Japan, for the sake of all Asian nations, cannot simply ignore it. The spokesperson pointed out that the strict implementation of Panama's laws was due to American pressure, and claimed that Japan hoped that the Panamanian government could restore its independent policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement accusing Panama, saying that Panama's expulsion of Japanese nationals, while allowing Chinese enterprises to continue operating such businesses, was an illegal discriminatory treatment. Although Panama nominally recognizes that yellow people are not welcome in the country, in practice, it only expels Japanese nationals. Regardless of the special status of Panama, this act is an unprecedented inhumane move.</p>
<h3>After the Completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, Foreign Trade Will Be More Convenient; Goods Can Enter and Exit Through Bhamo and Lashio; Freight on the Yunnan-Burma Highway Will Not Be Congested</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A special correspondent sent a long letter, recording the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, saying that there are continuous high mountains, deep valleys full of miasma, and wide rapid currents along the way, which must be climbed, penetrated, or crossed. The various difficulties in the project must be overcome, so the railway is almost a miraculous railway, and will be a major project, giving China a second supply lifeline in the west, so that lend-lease supplies can be continuously and quickly transported in. This will also realize China's old dream of connecting Central China to India, the Middle East, and Europe by railway, so as to shorten travel time. Moreover, the railway will open up a wider and lesser-known area than the Yunnan-Burma Highway, and will go further north. In the future, when it is completed, European and American goods will take this new route and be transported into the Chinese mainland through Province, or through Bhamo's Irrawaddy , or through Yangon, and back to the base of lend-lease supplies, Lashio. Then, the transportation on the Burma Highway will not be congested, and China's white jade, silk goods, and spices can also be continuously transported to Bhamo, which is where the items were transported by horses by merchants traveling along the small path along today's Yunnan-Burma Highway 1,500 years ago.

<h3>Cochlan Flies to Chongqing</h3>

<h3>Review of the Delineated and Undelineated Sections of the Yunnan-Burma Border</h3>
<p>— Tan Lian</p>
<p>Therefore, the northern section of the border line, whether it is Gaolianggong Mountain, Gaoligong Mountain, Xiaojiang En Hai, or Kaijiang, are all place names of national humiliation and loss of sovereignty in diplomatic history. It can be said that they are ominous place names and should be abolished and not used in the redrawing of the border line. Even the Five-Colored Border Line, not a single one has the qualifications to be a national border and should all be overturned. Because the foremost line of the Five-Colored Border Line, which is the original line set by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is also on the east bank of the Enmeikai River, which has already demarcated the Jiangxinpo and the Savage Mountain areas west of the Mailikai River outside the border. Other lines are even less worth discussing. The most important basis for our country's future border demarcation should be to take the entire Savage Mountain area as the only stronghold. Except for the part of the Savage Mountain area that has been demarcated into Myanmar according to previous treaties, the rest of the Savage Mountain area should belong to us, and no concession should be made even for a foot of land. Once the principle is established, the evidence of the old allegiance of the various Tusi to us should be presented to make a thorough solution. Yi Mingde, a member of the Southern Section Border Survey Committee, previously investigated the undelineated Yunnan-Burma border, and after returning, wrote the Suggestions for Handling the Northern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border Affairs, and proposed another line for reference for the undelineated area north of Jangaogao Mountain: The line starts from Jiangaogao Mountain, follows the Shie River, passes west through Panyao, follows the southern boundary of Hugong, to the Nayou tribe and the junction of Manipur and Assam, and then follows the Bakhai Mountain Longgangduo Mountain at the junction of Hugong Kanddi and Assam, straight to the junction of Xikang and Assam, including Hugong Kanddi Savage Mountain Qiuyi Langsu Chashan and other departments, in order to curb the British attempt to enter Kangzang from northern Myanmar. Professor Bai Meichu also proposed a line, which starts from Myitkyina, draws a line eastward to Jiangaotong, then draws a line westward from Myitkyina to Mong Gong, and then goes northwest, following the watershed between the Mailikai River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and goes north, straight to the Xikang border. Compared with Yi's proposed line, Bai's line expands southward, reaching Myitkyina to Mong Gong, and the southern end is larger than Yi's line; however, it only uses the three words "watershed" to describe the northward direction following the watershed between the Mailikai Yarlung Tsangpo River, without explaining the name of the mountain range, whether it refers to the Savage Mountains near the Nayou tribe; or to the Savage Mountains of Kumun Ridge; it cannot be proven and is easy to cause misunderstanding. In the past, during the Sino-British border negotiations, the word "watershed" was argued until the lips were parched and the tongue was dry, and it should be taken as a lesson for the future; do not use ambiguous nouns again, causing future disputes. Moreover, the British have been operating in Mong Gong and other places at the southern end for a long time, and it may not be easy to make him withdraw. In the future, when demarcating the border line, it would be great if the southern end could be proposed according to Bai's line; the western end is still clear according to Yi's line. Based on this, and then put forward what Myanmar itself said, "Myanmar once managed the land east of the river, until the confluence of the Enmeikai River and the Mailikai River." Blame him for demarcating the border at the confluence of the two rivers, which shows that the area north of the confluence is not Myanmar's territory and cannot be ceded at all, let alone the area west of the river. If this goal can be achieved, the proposal made by Envoy Xue in the past to take the watershed of the Mailikai and Enmeikai Rivers as the boundary will naturally be canceled invisibly. Fortunately, the Sino-British negotiations did not conclude any treaties, and we can still argue based on reason; otherwise, if we are bound by the treaty, the land will have become a fait accompli and we will not be able to have a say.</p>
<p>In the past, Xue Bian's diplomatic efforts could not be said to be completely lacking; only because of a mistake in not being familiar with the geography of the border areas, and a mistake in not being able to compete with others in terms of national strength, wanting to win with words, the effect was naturally very small. Now that our country's international status has increased since the Anti-Japanese War, and China and Britain are standing on the side of democracy, with closely related interests, the diplomatic relations are very close, far from what they used to be. If there are domestic diplomats who are good at responding to changes, and are assisted by talents who are familiar with the geography of the border areas, they will naturally have a clear understanding of border affairs and be well-prepared, and everything will be unconstrained, and they can negotiate as much as possible, and the difficulties will be easily solved. Therefore, it can be said that this border demarcation has begun to have a bright path, and continuous efforts to identify the road line will lead to the bright avenue. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Eastern Front War Enters 21st Week; Red Army in the Central Region Changes from Defense to Offense; Moscow Perimeter Battle Situation Greatly Improves; German Attack on Crimea Meets Strong Resistance</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - The 20th week of the Soviet-German War ended today. News came that Soviet troops had launched fierce counterattacks west and northwest of Moscow, and German troops had won a victory at the eastern end of Crimea. According to a *Pravda* reporter, street fighting is now taking place northeast of Galining City, 100 miles northeast of Moscow. Soviet military operations to eliminate a German troop in the vicinity of Volynsk are continuing. Soviet troops in and around Mozhaisk are still engaged in counterattacks. There is no real change in the war situation in the three districts of Maloyaroslavets, Shipkov, and Naro-Fominsk.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - According to dispatches from the front, although the Germans have exerted all their strength to reach Moscow before the arrival of winter, they have not made great progress in recent days, and the area currently occupied by the Germans does not seem to be closer to Moscow than it was two weeks ago. It is believed that the bad weather is currently hindering the Germans' actions. In some places, especially in the Volokolamsk district, the fierce counterattack by the Soviet army has improved its position. The German High Command broke its silence on the war situation on the Moscow front last night. In the Crimean Peninsula, the German side admitted to encountering strong resistance and mentioned "passable mountain areas." There is currently little new news coming from the Donets Basin. Regarding Stalin's claim of German losses, the official German news agency replied that as of October 31, Soviet losses had reached 7.8 million.</p>
<p>Moscow Square Holds Grand Review; Stalin Encourages Red Army Soldiers</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - The most interesting news from yesterday was the dispatch from Moscow. Although the city is not far from the attacking German troops and is threatened by German aircraft, the Red Army still held a grand exercise to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution. Stalin spoke with a calm conviction. (See another dispatch for the speech.) The fact that hundreds of Soviet tanks participated in the exercise seems to indicate that the Soviet army in Moscow does not lack military supplies. The weather is still quite unfavorable, with wind and snow, which puts the troops to a severe test of endurance.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 8th - The Red Army held a review in Red Square to commemorate the Soviet October Revolution. Stalin delivered a speech, saying, "We are currently fighting against the Nazis along the entire line. Twenty-three years ago, when we first celebrated the anniversary of the October Revolution, we had no allies. At that time, the Red Army was not strong and was still in the initial stage of organization. There were neither sufficient military equipment nor military supplies. Now we have united allies and have the support of the people of Europe who are under Nazi sanctions. We will surely win the final victory. Who can doubt it? There is already a feeling of anger among the people of Europe and the German people. German invaders have exerted their last strength to fight. Comrades, the whole world is watching you. The countries under Nazi sanctions are hoping that you will liberate them. You have been entrusted with the great mission of liberating the masses.

<h3>U.S. Prepares to Use Massive Funds to Defeat Nazi and Fascist Ideologies; Advises Finland to Ceasefire with the Soviet Union; Content of U.S.-Finland Talks Released</h3>
<p>Washington, 8th (Reuters) – Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the U.S. has not yet received a reply from the Finnish government after informing Finland that it would lose American friendship if it did not cease its offensive against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The record of Hull's October 3rd conversation with the Finnish Minister to the U.S. has now been released. It states that Hull informed the Finnish government that he was pleased to hear that Finland had recovered its lost territories. However, Hitler is now employing barbaric methods, seeking to conquer the world. The question now is whether Finland will be satisfied with recovering its lost territories and pursue a ceasefire, or whether it will continue to advance and participate in the general war between Germany and the Soviet Union on Hitler's side. The United States is prepared, if necessary, to use $75,000,000,000 to assist in resisting Hitler and his ideology and eradicating it.</p>
<p>A memorandum of Deputy Secretary of State Welles' conversation with the Finnish Minister includes Welles' statement that the Soviet Union is prepared to negotiate a new peace treaty with Finland, and that the Soviet Union will grant land concessions to Finland, but this does not imply Soviet weakness. According to official information and other evidence obtained by the United States, the Soviet Union is indeed prepared to resist Germany to the end, and as far as the U.S. government knows, there are indeed reasons to believe that the Soviet Union will continue to resist for a long time. The Finnish Minister asked what guarantees Britain and the United States could provide to Finland to ensure that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty would be maintained even after Germany's defeat, and whether the Soviet Union would respect the promises given by Britain and the United States and not attempt to seize Finland again. Welles replied that such questions could only arise after Finland was willing to study the possibility of making peace. He questioned whether Finland believed it could obtain guarantees or promises to preserve its autonomy after a German victory, fearing that Finland would have no one to turn to at that time. If Germany is defeated, what need has Finland to worry about friends?</p>
<p>Finns Tired of War, Germany Uneasy</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that a broadcast in English on Thursday night by the Finnish Lai-Ti wireless station, stating that "as far as Finland is concerned, military actions are now coming to an end," has clearly made Germany very uneasy. Berlin issued contradictory denials of this news yesterday, stating that according to news from the German News Agency in Finland, the Finnish radio station did not make this announcement. Another German source provided a more detailed account, acknowledging that Finland had ceased hostilities in the Karelia region it had recovered. London believes that the sentiment expressed by the Finnish broadcaster on Thursday night undoubtedly represents the opinion of the majority of the Finnish people. The broadcaster did not give his name, and the beginning of the broadcast was not heard. London officials are aware that it would be unwise to overemphasize this broadcast. However, the most noteworthy point is the anxiety caused to listeners by the Finnish hint that it may no longer serve their interests.</p>
<h3>British Aid to the Soviet Union is Not Thorough; Opening a Second Front Still Awaits; But Significant Blows Have Been Dealt to Germany in the Air War</h3>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) – A Reuters air force correspondent reports that although Britain has not yet been able to open a second land front to aid the Soviet Union, it has indeed fully struck Germany in the second air front. This is the new and significant meaning of the work of the British Air Force's Bomber, Fighter, and Coastal Commands in Western Europe during the six months from May to October this year. Recent official and semi-official documents can prove the following undeniable reasons: During the above six-month period, the Bomber Command alone dropped more than 20,000 tons of bombs on Germany and its occupied territories, far exceeding the same period last year, and inevitably increasing the damage to Germany's war machine. The Coastal and Fighter Commands sank or destroyed 332 enemy ships, which is the most significant blow to Germany's maritime resources since the start of the war, as the supply of German troops on both the eastern and western fronts depends on these ships. The Fighter and Bomber Commands have tied down half of the German Air Force's fighter strength, preventing them from operating in the Soviet Union. The tens of thousands of flights by the Coastal and Fighter Commands to protect Allied ships have made an indelible contribution to ensuring the continuous flow of American supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>

For example, the newly established Sixteenth and Seventeenth Middle Schools are reorganized from these middle school classes. Regarding the management of national middle schools, in order to facilitate management in the future, the number of students in each school will be limited to prevent it from being too large. Branch schools previously established by various schools have been ordered to be abolished as much as possible in order to concentrate management. In addition, the Ministry of Education is cooperating with the Sichuan Provincial Education Bureau to find ways to manufacture scientific instruments themselves, hoping to produce them in large quantities to meet urgent educational needs. In addition, it is reported that a batch of books and instruments ordered by universities in the rear from the United States has recently arrived in Yangon and is being transported inland.</p>

<h3>Guang Gang Procures Miscellaneous Brands of Yarn; Double Horse Re-emerges with 3,000 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had declined, rebounded again today. This was due to the rebound in gold prices, which improved sentiment. At the same time, factories are reducing working days more and more drastically, and the number of Double Horse yarns coming out is gradually decreasing. Therefore, some large players are still thinking of buying at low prices. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory singles this morning was 2,940 yuan due to poor sentiment in the afternoon, which made the public tend to be bearish, a drop of 85 yuan compared to the previous day. Soon after, it was lowered to 2,925 yuan. However, as soon as the low appeared, the shorts were eager to cover their positions, and the momentum suddenly turned bullish. At the same time, gold prices were reported to be rising again. As a result, buyers came one after another, and the market rose steadily. The peak once reached 3,060 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that the exchange had finalized the grades of miscellaneous yarns, and it should be able to resume business next Monday. As a result, shorts became active and exerted pressure. The closing price was 3,020 yuan.</p>
<p>The grade table of the Double Horse Exchange has been published and excerpted as follows: 20-count special Jin Cheng equal product 23-count Golden Rooster plus 30 yuan, Da Fa plus 20 yuan, Tian Nu minus 40 yuan, Double Earth minus 110 yuan, 20-count Samsung minus 130 yuan, Wu Fu minus 130 yuan, Mu Yang minus 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Other brands generally subtract 100 yuan, with the lowest subtracting 140 yuan. Only designated factory singles can be delivered, and foreign factories are not included in this example.</p>
<p>The spot yarn situation is good, and the trend continues to be strong. This is because Guang Gang suddenly came to collect 20-count Wu Fu, Mu Yang, Samsung, and 32-count Wu Fu, Mu Yang, and other yarns, totaling about 300 to 400 bales. As a result, sentiment was boosted, and buying interest was strong. Some people say that because the price of Japanese yarn is surprisingly hard, the price of 20-count upper-grade yarn is above 3,120 yuan, and the price of middle-grade yarn is also between 3,040 and 3,050 yuan, and the supply is quite tight. However, recently, the price of coarse cotton has seen a slight rebound. It is said that the average price of raw materials for spinning 20-count yarn is currently between 800 yuan and 850 yuan per 100 catties. Spinning one bale requires 350 catties of materials. The shorts also argue that if the situation in the Pacific becomes tense, the yarn market will be unstable. It is estimated that the turnover in half a day was 700 bales, and the market rose by 50 to 60 yuan.</p>
<p>The Double Horse futures market went from a sharp rise to a slight pullback, and the situation suddenly reversed to bullish. When it opened in the morning, it first opened in the dark market with factory singles and then gradually advanced. It once reached a high of over 3,050 yuan, and because general investors believed that the overseas prospects would be more promising, they absorbed more. When the futures yarn opened, the number of buyers suddenly increased. Coupled with the shorts covering their positions, the market was temporarily controlled by buying interest. The opening price for November revealed a rising edge of 1,830 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Afterwards, after the pull-up by the buyers and the covering by the shorts, it once reached a high of 2,920 yuan. Since gold prices rose and sentiment became more upward, December opened at a high price of 3,100 yuan, a sudden increase of 133 yuan. January was 3,150 yuan, also a good increase of 96 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered, and the footing was still strong. Although it later weakened slightly due to the sale of floating positions, there was no sign of weakness. As a result of the fluctuations in half a day, they all rebounded by more than 60 yuan to more than 100 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>November December January Opening 2830.0 3100.0 3150.0 Highest 2920.0 3100.0 3160.0 Lowest 2820.0 3035.0 3096.0 Closing 2910.0 3065.0 3120.0 Comparison Rise 100.0 Rise 23.0 Rise 66.0</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation is slightly weak, and coarse cotton has fallen by more than 10 yuan, but fine cotton is still strong.</p>
<p>Brazilian 300 pieces 1375.0 Gongda entered Langgong 100 pieces 728.0 Haojia and 300 pieces 726.0 and Aomula 200 pieces 730.0 and and 100 pieces 735.0 and</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose due to purchases by Wall Street and peers, then fell slightly due to sales by New Orleans and profit-taking by longs, and finally rose again due to purchases by spot traders and short covering. Yesterday's closing price rose by 13 to 17 points each compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to short covering, and then fell due to the tense situation in the Far East and sales by European exporters. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by about 2 rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 1 rupee today.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that Indian cotton transshipped through Hong Kong. Yihua Yangxing's Yuan Niu ship arrived in port yesterday, loaded with 700 pieces of cotton from Hong Kong, which was produced in India.</p>
<h3>Leading Fine Cloth Wants to Rise But Falls Instead; Exchange Will Change Colored Ball to Standard</h3>
<p>The factory cloth fell and then rebounded. This was because the price of cloth had fallen in the downstream in recent days, which aroused the buying intention of buyers. However, due to the weekend, the turnover was still weak. As a result, the price of cloth was flat, and some rebounded by about 1 yuan per piece. More than 300 pieces were traded on this street.</p>
<p>Dong cloth wanted to rise but fell instead, and the situation revolved. The highest price of Longtou fine cloth factory singles was shouted at 116 to 117 yuan, and it fell to 113.5 yuan at noon. The peak of Sijunzi Bigi was 4 yuan 012 points, and the closing price was 3 yuan 97.5 cents. The process was calm. There was no market in the afternoon as usual. It is heard that the exchange's futures cloth has been scheduled to resume business and auctioning with colored ball fine cloth as the standard. In its grade table, those who deliver with Longtou are raised by 7.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lining for Woolen Fabrics is Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric lining, recently affected by the rising prices of raw silk yarn, various grades of goods have reported rising prices. Because the profit margin of this military is thin, most of the products of general manufacturers have been delayed. There are also manufacturers who do not care about their reputation and are unwilling to deliver the goods that were originally scheduled to be opened due to losses. At present, Western clothing gangs are selling well, and the market's digestion is very healthy. Silk-glossy feather yarn, rubber, glossy satin, brown satin, printed cloth, soft lining, pocket cloth, French lining, and black charcoal lining were all sold at high prices yesterday due to the shortage of goods. Datong silk-glossy feather yarn was sold for 4.5 yuan, Hua Xiangpi satin for 8 yuan, Yongcheng electro-optic satin for 7 yuan, Changming Guangming satin for 5 yuan, Lianxin Ma brown satin for 5 yuan, Hongsheng printed cloth for 4.8 yuan, Gongping soft lining for 2.7 yuan, Yuan Ji Sheng French lining for 1.6 yuan, and Meitai black charcoal lining for 9.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>In the Face of Competition by all Sides, Burned Red is Exhausted</h3>
<p>One and a Half Hours to Raise 1150 Yuan: Yesterday's cash burned red dark market suddenly rebounded, having returned outside the 20,000 yuan mark, and twice again leaped to outside of 21,000 yuan. According to the uncertainty of great hearts on all sides, the buying momentum of a couple of banks has resumed, a certain securities firm has covered shorts, the Hong Kong gang also has absorption, and the chips on the counter again felt exhausted. The price, from 19,900 yuan, flew up to 21,100 yuan. Finally, it was sold by Xianghe and Tianyuan. It was seen to retreat. In the end, it was squeezed up 1,150 yuan. About 7,000 taels were traded in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Gilt also stepped up 100 yuan, reaching 2,120 yuan.</p>

The price then leaped straight up, stepping up 1,150 yuan, coaxing to 21,050 yuan. After 9:30, Dafeng and Xiangxingyong re-entered, and Defu and Shunyuan especially surged. It was actually a coax of 300 yuan, reaching 21,100 yuan. It was sold by Chengji Xianghe Tianyuan, a small 500 yuan, retreating to 20,600 yuan. Defu and Xianghe competed to enter, and it was coaxed up 250 yuan before the noon closing.

In an hour and a half of business, there was a high and low of 1,200 yuan. The gold shop's own brand gold was sold for 21,000 yuan at the door, and bought in at around 20,000 yuan. Gilt was hung up 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Gilt was Hung up 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of gilt per tael in jewelry stores, Datongxing and Xintongxing first hung up three times, rising 130 yuan, reaching 2,150 yuan. At 10:30, it returned a small 30 yuan, to 2,120 yuan (buy-in reduced by 150 yuan), squeezing up 100 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Diminishing Need for the Black Market Exchange</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market saw no change in the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. HSBC's small counter rates remained stagnant. The black market rates for British and American currencies were relatively stable. Importers of non-essential goods showed little interest. Although some Chinese merchants offered US dollars at 2.625 and 2.75 yuan, there were few buyers. At 11:10 AM, wealthy individuals purchased tens of thousands from Chinese speculators at a rate of 19,879 (market price).

Japanese and Korean gold notes rose sharply, with the former reaching 4.1 yuan and the latter rising to 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Foreign Exchange Available; Decline in Rice Prices is Natural</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the decision of the Price Equalization Fund to provide foreign exchange for the maximum limit of rice imports needed each month, estimated at 250,000 bags, with a total value of 40 million yuan in national currency, which is sufficient to meet the city's demand, and with incoming shipments arriving one after another, and the concession authorities also tightening supervision, rumors and unfavorable factors combined, leading to a rush to sell by large firms, hoarders, and small speculators alike as the market opened. With few buyers, prices plummeted all the way down until the market closed, without any sign of recovery. No. 1 Saigon rice fell from 193 yuan to 188 yuan, No. 2 from 180 yuan to 175 yuan, No. 1 Siamese rice from 181-2 yuan to 180 yuan, No. 2 to 170 yuan, French Hua Jian rice to 184-5 yuan, Min Dang Gao rice from 180 yuan, then to 175 yuan, Small Jiao rice from 160 yuan, fell to 155-6 yuan, then 153-4 yuan, to 151 yuan, Broken Jian rice from 136 yuan, fell to 133-4 yuan, a continuous decline of 3-5 yuan compared to before. The British-Chinese company saw small Jiao rice at 193.5 yuan initially, then 180 yuan, but later there were few buyers, with 27,000 bags and 600 tons traded.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yuan Sheng and Ming Sheng vessels arrived simultaneously, both carrying foreign rice. The Yuan Sheng vessel carried 8,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which was the municipal council's price-controlled rice. The Ming Sheng vessel carried 17,220 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 10,500 bags were the municipal council's price-controlled rice, and the rest were commercial goods. Both vessels docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading, hence the decline in rice prices is natural. (Zu)</p>
<p>Local rice market: Thick and thin japonica rice shops on this street are slightly [difficult to describe]. However, due to limited arrivals, sellers are not willing to sell at low prices. As a result, prices only softened slightly following foreign rice. Early and late rice from Nan Gang opened at 205 yuan, then fell to 198 yuan. New Kunshan japonica rice ranged from 206 yuan to 203 yuan. Qing Jiao Rong Zhong rice ranged from 205 yuan to 200 yuan. Du Jian rice was priced at 190 yuan, with little trading activity. Due to the scarcity of foreign glutinous rice in the market, the base price was quite firm. Therefore, although foreign rice prices fell, it was able to sustain, without showing prosperity or decline. Continued sales of Hong Kong glutinous rice ranged from 222 yuan to 218 yuan. Glutinous rice tea was priced at 204-5 yuan. Local glutinous rice sales were sluggish, with no trading reported.</p>
<h3>Noodle Market Unable to Support the Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign noodles followed the decline of foreign rice. Actual sales were low, and buyers were particularly hesitant. The realization of the price-controlled noodle policy is imminent, and both the drop in rice prices and rumors of negative news are unfavorable to large firms and hoarders. Therefore, those seeking quick profits were the first to sell off, and large firms secretly released their holdings, causing the market to collapse. Golden Dragon noodles initially opened at 54.5 yuan, then fell slightly. Later, sellers offered prices at 53.5 yuan, but there were still few buyers. Therefore, the market may have to weaken further.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Actual Sales of Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>The black market trading of coarse grains was still dull yesterday. There were few buyers for actual sales, and the attitude of buyers was generally lax. Therefore, the market continued to decline. Qingdao raw oil was priced at 392 yuan, Qin Shan factory rapeseed oil at 261 yuan, Tianjin Jin Yuan at 102 yuan, Jiaozhou yellow beans at 107 yuan, Chongming sandworms at 61 yuan, Dutch yellow corn at 40 yuan to 47.5 yuan, white corn at 47 yuan to 46.5 yuan, and Saigon new corn at 59.5 yuan to 59 yuan. October shipments were priced at 90.05 yuan, and November shipments at 91 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bond Trading Concentrated on Class C Bonds; Retreats and Advances around the 6 Yuan Mark; Wheelock &amp; Co. Pays Interim Dividend</h3>
<p>Government bond unofficial market: Yesterday, Sichuan bankers did not continue selling, but due to depressed sentiment, sellers were still very active. Class C bonds retreated and advanced around the 6 yuan mark, ultimately closing within the 6 yuan range, indicating fierce competition between both sides. Activity was concentrated on Class C bonds, followed by Class E bonds. Yesterday was Saturday, and the market opened at 11:00 AM, with only one session. Class C bonds opened slightly lower at 4.5 yuan, with the opening price settling at 5.8 yuan. Thereafter, buyers and sellers competed fiercely around the 6 yuan mark, and after breaking through 6 yuan five or six times, it ultimately closed within the range. The sentiment appeared to be dominated by short sellers. Lian Yi Sheng, Da Heng Kang, and retail investors bought, while Hong Da, Yi Tai, Tong Shun, and Jiu Feng sold. As a result, except for Class D bonds, which saw no trading at all, other types declined by a small amount of 0.05 to 0.3-0.4 yuan. Approximately 1.2-1.3 million yuan was traded. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified Class A | 72.90 | 72.60 | 72.60 | Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Class B | 68.40 | 67.60 | 67.60 | Up 0.30</p>
<p>Unified Class C | 66.20 | 65.80 | 65.85 | Up 0.40</p>
<p>Unified Class E | 66.10 | 65.90 | 65.00 | Down 0.1</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Qing Feng Textile Factory were traded at a price of 360 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Wheelock &amp; Co., a British company, is scheduled to pay an interim dividend of 5 yuan per share in national currency on December 5th, covering the period up to the end of March 1942. In addition, its affiliated companies, Shanghai Tug &amp; Lighter Co. and Mow Tai Co., are also scheduled to pay interim dividends for 1941 on December 4th. Shanghai Tug &amp; Lighter Co. will pay 3.5% annual interest on preference shares and 20 yuan per share in national currency on ordinary shares. Mow Tai Co. will pay a dividend of 5 yuan per share in national currency.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Fluctuations Remain Large</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was affected by the extreme shortage of foreign exchange and Hong Kong [missing character] positions. The trend continued upwards, with the forward price rising sharply by 25 yuan. Spot prices also rose by 25-6 yuan to 20 yuan. In the afternoon, as sellers gradually released their holdings, prices softened. However, they were still up 14-5 yuan to 22 yuan compared to the previous day, with varying degrees of increase. Dutch red sugar initially rose by 23 yuan, then fell back by 18 yuan, still up 5 yuan. Hong Kong raw sugar rose by 20 yuan to 15 yuan. Taikoo white sugar rose by 5 yuan to 10 yuan. For Company Futures, 14 raw and white sugar for the 20th opened at 340 yuan, then went to 325 yuan, then 30.5 yuan. The month-end contract opened at 158 yuan to 53 yuan, rose to 62 yuan mid-session, then fell back to 48 yuan. For spot goods, 24 raw and white sugar for October import were priced at 335 yuan, 40 yuan, and 34 yuan; for September, 30 yuan, 40 yuan, and 33 yuan; for August, 36 yuan and 1 yuan. Hong Kong raw sugar initially opened flat at 286 yuan, then rose to 300 yuan to 295 yuan. Dutch red sugar was priced at 288 yuan to 70 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Liao was 320 yuan, HX Liao was 310 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Ming Sheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 600 bags of sugar in addition to a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Evidence of Market Manipulation; Charcoal and White Coal Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the listed prices for charcoal and white coal remained unchanged across various businesses, the unofficial market prices suddenly surged due to hoarding and extensive buying up of old warehouse receipts by speculators. Prices in the market soared by over 100 yuan. Hongji white coal rose from 780 yuan to 920 yuan, No. 1 small coal was 900 yuan, and Haifeng white coal was 920 yuan. Indian anthracite coal exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, all setting new records. There is clear evidence of market speculation and manipulation. If businesses continue to hoard without selling, retail stores on this street will face supply shortages.</p>
<h3>Diverse Types of Imported and Exported Coarse Grains and Oilseed Cakes</h3>
<p>Imports were quite active yesterday. Items transported from Tianjin included 1,950 bags of soybeans, 550 bags of raw kernels, 158 pieces of tobacco shreds, 148 bags of walnuts, 220 pieces of dates, and 1,365 bags of chestnuts. Also, 22 pieces of sea cucumber, 4 pieces of shark fins, and 1 box of bird's nests were transported from Hong Kong. Exports of coarse grains on the 9th included 200 bags of soybeans and 2,480 pieces of oilseed cake to Siam, 330 pieces of raw oil to Xiamen, 100 bags of sesame seeds, and 100 pieces of sesame oil. In addition, 420 boxes of tea were transported to Hong Kong, and 120 boxes to Siam. Also, 72 packages of silk floss were transported to Hong Kong, and 12 packages to Siam.</p>
<h3>Chestnuts (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Regarding the Biography of Xiao Han Jianu in the History of Liao, "Xiao Han Jianu managed the chestnut gardens in Nanjing (present-day Beijing). In the fourth year of Chongxi... Emperor Liao Xingzong asked him casually, 'Are there any interesting stories from your hometown?' He replied, 'I only know about stir-frying chestnuts; if the small ones are cooked, the large ones must be raw, and if the large ones are cooked, the small ones must be burnt. Only when they are all cooked evenly, regardless of size, is it perfect!' The Emperor laughed heartily." This vividly describes the situation of stir-frying chestnuts of different sizes in a pot! Not only that, but even what we now commonly call "sugar-roasted chestnuts" has been clearly recorded! According to Zhou [missing character] of Jiaxing, a person from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, in his Record of Xijin: "The Liao Dynasty established the Chestnut Garden Office in Nanjing... Yuan Changping County also had chestnut gardens... Nowadays, in the markets of Yanjing (Beijing), in autumn, they stir-fry [chestnuts] with maltose mixed with small stones. The chestnuts are smaller than those in the south, but the taste is quite sweet, and they are called 'Imperial Chestnuts,' precisely because they are not valued for their large size." Li Shizhen of the late Ming Dynasty summarized the ways of eating chestnuts in his Compendium of Materia Medica: "...Chestnuts... treat kidney deficiency and weak waist and legs. Fill a bag with raw chestnuts and hang it in a dry place, and eat more than ten of them every morning... Chestnuts dried in the wind are better than those sun-dried, and chestnuts roasted in fire or stir-fried in oil are better than steamed or boiled!... (End)"</p>

<h3>US Marine Corps in Shanghai Ordered to Prepare for Evacuation; Merchant Corps A Company to be Deployed Tomorrow Night; Washington's Order Has Significant Implications; US Troops' 15 Years in Shanghai Have Been Instrumental in Maintaining Stability</h3>
<p>The commander of the US Marine Corps in China has reportedly received a telegram from Washington ordering the immediate evacuation of the Marine Corps stationed in China. It is reported that the total number of US troops stationed in China is 970, including 750 in Shanghai, 165 in Tianjin, and 55 in Beiping. The troops stationed in Shanghai are the Fourth Regiment under Major General Myers.</p>
<p>The World Situation is Becoming Increasingly Clear</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made a statement in Chongqing the day before yesterday, expressing that democratic countries and China will surely win the final victory. News has also been reported that US President Roosevelt has ordered the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps stationed in China. At a time when the Japanese side is publicly advocating for the seizure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, this move echoes the situation and symbolically represents the trend of the Far East and the world situation. Yesterday, the US Consulate General in Shanghai, the headquarters of the US Fourth Regiment, and the US Yangtze River Fleet Command remained tight-lipped about Washington's withdrawal of troops from China. However, according to official sources, Roosevelt's announcement of considering the withdrawal of US ground troops from China has the significance of preparing for war and taking a firm stance in the reopened US-Japan talks. In reality, the 750 US troops stationed in Shanghai are essential to maintaining "law and order" under the current circumstances, especially in the Shanghai concession.</p>
<p>International Merchant Corps to Prepare for Deployment</p>
<p>Since the British garrison withdrew last half-year, the defense zone has been temporarily taken over by the International Merchant Corps. The mission of the US Myers team has therefore become more important. The entire Shanghai community believes that the US Myers team has made its best efforts within the defense zone, and that the good situation in this city is entirely dependent on them. If they were to leave suddenly, people's hearts would inevitably be unsettled, and for the sake of the US's own rights, it would be better to postpone the withdrawal unless absolutely necessary. According to reliable sources, the International Merchant Corps A Company has been ordered to be deployed at 5 PM tomorrow. The other companies have also been ordered to be prepared to deploy at any time within half an hour. It is unknown whether this matter is related to the news of the US Myers' withdrawal.</p>
<p>Foreign Residents in Shanghai Express Opinions</p>
<p>Mr. Aler Many, an American lawyer and American director of the Municipal Council, recently made a statement saying that the US Fourth Marine Regiment has had a stabilizing effect on the situation in Shanghai, especially during this period. Sir Marshall, a major British businessman in Shanghai and chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, also stated, "We certainly hope that the US Marine Corps will stay in Shanghai, but if the US government feels that US troops must withdraw, then in light of the current world situation, this move is indeed reasonable." The Japanese side did not issue any official criticism regarding the possible withdrawal of the US Marine Corps from Shanghai. However, the personal opinions of the Japanese are that the move to recall US troops could be interpreted as a significant political gesture by Washington, and they believe that this move is unrelated to any "threat" in the Far East, but rather a sign of the US's possible actions in the Pacific. According to a certain securities broker, the Stock Exchange will be closed this morning, and the market is expected to feel the repercussions when it opens on Monday. However, the planned withdrawal of US troops has long been anticipated and should not cause surprise.</p>
<p>Stationed in Shanghai for 15 Years</p>
<p>The US Fourth Marine Regiment arrived here on the US transport ship Cape Mont on February 24, 1927, and has been stationed in Shanghai ever since. Since the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Shanghai last year, the city has experienced numerous disturbances, and US troops have participated in maintaining law and order together with the defense forces of other countries, taking on a greater share of responsibility in maintaining the security of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the Anniversary of Establishment</p>
<p>The US Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai is scheduled to celebrate the 166th anniversary of the establishment of the US Marine Corps tomorrow. Track and field competitions will be held at the US School playground at 9 AM, and commemorative medals will be awarded at 11 AM. The entire program consists of 20 segments, beginning with raising the flag and ending with playing the national anthem and regimental song. Mr. Lockehead, the US Consul (replaced by Stanton due to illness), Major General Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, Mr. Hicks, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Lowden, the US Judge, and Mr. Frankling, president of the Columbia Club, are all officials of the conference. The official banquet will be held by the regiment at the American Club from 6 PM to 8 PM tomorrow, presided over by Colonel Howard, the commander, with a "birthday cake" for guests. At the same time, Major General Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Consul Lockehead (replaced by Stanton) will deliver speeches. From 6:45 PM to 7 PM, the Great American Evening News and the US-China Broadcasting Station will have commemorative programs.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council to Hold Special Meeting This Afternoon; Price Control Plan May be Revealed Tomorrow; Eagerly Awaiting Announcement of Foreign Exchange Quota</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council announced yesterday that it will hold a special meeting at 11 AM today to make decisions on the implementation of the price control issue. Due to the absence of Chairman Liddell, who is on official business in Hong Kong, the special meeting will be chaired by Deputy Chairman Okamoto. All other directors of various nationalities, except for Mr. Mains, will participate. Mr. Philip, the Director-General and CEO, will also attend. It is understood that although today is a holiday, the Municipal Council will reveal the main points of the price control plan. Therefore, Director-General Philip is scheduled to meet with Chinese and foreign reporters at 3 PM this afternoon to announce the resolutions.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Foreign Exchange Quota Not Yet Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization Fund has increased the foreign exchange quota allocated to Shanghai for importing rice to a minimum of approximately US$2 million per month, and has continued to allocate approximately US$1 million for importing coal to Shanghai. It is also reported that the Price Stabilization Fund has agreed in principle to allocate foreign exchange for Shanghai to import wheat, flour, and American films, but the amount is still under negotiation. The news that foreign exchange has been agreed upon for the above-mentioned goods is believed to be the result of the trip to Hong Kong by Municipal Council Chairman Liddell and US Director Mains. The foreign exchange allocated by the Price Stabilization Fund for rice and grain will likely be handed over to the Municipal Council. This amount of foreign exchange will be sufficient to transport 250,000 bags of rice here each month.</p>
<p>Hoping for the Distribution of Total Monthly Supply</p>
<p>The foreign exchange supplied by the Price Stabilization Fund will be recorded by the Shanghai Wheat Import Merchants Association. It is reported that the association is scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss suppressing wheat prices. According to an important exporter who spoke to reporters, it is hoped that the Price Stabilization Fund can announce the monthly supply amount of foreign exchange for each imported item. If the association can announce this figure in advance, import merchants in Shanghai will be able to manage all retail prices in the short term.</p>
<p>Hoping that Citizens Have Confidence</p>
<p>At the 10th General Meeting of the British Residents Association held at the Racecourse the day before yesterday, the chairman of the association, Mr. Coura, made a speech stating that Shanghai does not lack any supply of materials, but only that the general public lacks confidence. In fact, there is a sufficient supply of daily necessities in the city, so there is no reason to be afraid. Mr. Coura also mentioned the foreign exchange issue, saying that there is sufficient reason to believe that adequate legal foreign exchange will be obtained in the future to supply Shanghai. Mr. Coura also reported on matters jointly studied and carried out by the association and the Municipal Council, such as the closure of gambling dens in western Shanghai and the Seymour Road vegetable market, school fees, gas fees, and price control. Mr. Coura advised the general consumer to assist the Municipal Council in managing prices in the city as much as possible, but believed that passive assistance was not enough. He urged consumers not only to refuse to buy items sold at prices exceeding the regulations, but also to persuade others not to buy them, and at the same time report the locations and store numbers of those selling at prices exceeding the regulations to the authorities for investigation. Mr. Coura concluded by saying that British residents in Shanghai not only represent the outpost of the British Empire, but also represent the British people beyond the outpost, and that what can influence the Chinese people's understanding of Britain is not the actions of the British people, but the actions of British residents in China. It was also learned that as a result of the association's election yesterday, Coura, Woodhead, and 14 others were elected as directors.</p>
<h3>President Lines Trying Their Best to Arrange; Plans to Send Two Ships to Shanghai; Accurate News Expected by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>Regarding rumors that the ships of the American President Lines will resume sailing to Shanghai, a certain member of the company recently replied to a customer's inquiry, saying that there is no definite news yet. However, he has received information that the company is currently making every effort to arrange for two ships to sail to Shanghai. These two ships may arrive in Shanghai within the third week of this month. As soon as news is received, the approximate sailing schedules of the two ships will be published in the company's advertisements. Passengers and shipping companies who wish to board these two ships can pay attention to this announcement. It is also reported that the Fula Company will have a cargo ship arriving in Shanghai within days. Inquiries with the company did not yield a definite answer.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds: Urging Collection of Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Ministry of Finance to all embassies and consulates abroad, all receiving banks, all branches, and all organizations: It has been verified that the first redemption of the National Salvation Bonds was carried out by lottery in August of this year. The winning numbers are 312, 474, 691, and 935. All bond certificates with the same last three digits as the above numbers are the first winning bond certificates. These winning bond certificates and the fourth matured interest coupons began to be paid from August 31st of this year. The overseas portion should be collected by overseas Chinese through local receiving banks, who should collect the principal and interest from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Hong Kong. The period for collection is three years from the date of payment. Any unclaimed amount will be forfeited. This Ministry has issued a public notice and published notices in overseas newspapers for notification. Due to the fact that overseas Chinese have purchased National Salvation Bonds all over the world and the regions are vast, there may be cases where the principal and interest have not been collected overdue due to lack of information. In order to safeguard the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, this Ministry has approved that if overseas bondholders hold National Salvation Bond certificates and their interest coupons, if they are overdue, they can still submit an application to the receiving banks in various places or directly to this Ministry for flexible payment.</p>
<h3>Rumor in Japanese Media that British Residents in North China are Preparing to Evacuate</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Continental News, after the British authorities in China advised British residents who did not need to stay to evacuate for the second time, there are currently approximately 2,000 British residents in North China, including 200 in Beiping, 820 in Tianjin, 240 in Qingdao, and 290 [in another location]. Part of them are preparing to evacuate, while another part does not care about abandoning their properties in China and, because they grew up in China, are not prepared to [evacuate]. There are currently approximately 1,500 American residents in North China, approximately 8,000 White Russians, and approximately 1,500 Germans.</p>
<h3>Abundant Supply of Foreign Rice; Over 18,000 Bags of Low-Priced Rice Arrived Yesterday; Buyers Crowded; More Sales Locations to be Added</h3>
<p>The supply of foreign rice is abundant. The Municipal Council's low-priced rice and the foreign rice purchased by merchants are continuously arriving, as reported in this newspaper many times. It is now learned that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yuan Sheng and Ming Sheng vessels arrived one after another yesterday afternoon, both carrying foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Yuan Sheng vessel carried 8,100 bags, all of which were the Municipal Council's low-priced small Jiao rice. The Ming Sheng vessel carried 17,220 bags, of which 10,200 bags were the Municipal Council's low-priced small Jiao rice, and the rest were commercial rice. Both vessels were docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Rice Sales Location to be Established in the Western District</p>
<p>According to responsible sources, the Municipal Council will establish a special rice sales location in the western district next week to facilitate residents in areas outside the Concession to purchase nearby and reduce the crowding of civilians competing for low-priced Hong Kong rice in front of rice shops within the Public Concession. Businessmen in the city center have consulted with the Municipal Council, requesting that the council cancel the ban on transporting rice from the Public Concession into the Nantao area. However, the Municipal Council has not confirmed or denied this matter.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Large Quantities of Gold Bars being Smuggled into Shanghai; Shanghai's Gold Prices are the Highest in the World</h3>
<p>In recent months, gold prices in Shanghai have risen madly, reaching an unprecedented high of over 22,000 yuan per bar, causing various commodity prices to rise on the pretext of high prices. The current price of gold per ounce is far more expensive than in the United States, and even more expensive than anywhere else in the world. It is rumored that a large number of gold bars have been smuggled into Shanghai from Hong Kong and Dalian for sale. It is also rumored that a large number of gold bars have been smuggled into Shanghai from various other places recently.</p>
<h3>Iron Barbed Wire Suddenly Erected on the Border of the Western District of Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

The barbed wire had not been removed as of last night.</p>
<h3>Crew Members of Dredger Arrested; Reportedly Conscripted to Moji</h3>
<p>After the Construction dredger of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau was leased to the Japanese side and sailed to Moji Bay Port, the original crew members were dismissed by the bureau for opposing the transfer. For days, the entire crew petitioned the bureau. As for the two crew members who were arrested, Zhu Mujin and Zhang Along, their families repeatedly went to the bureau to appeal. One account says that the two crew members have been [forcibly] transferred to Moji by [Japanese] ship.</p>

<p>It is now the Beginning of Winter, and Severe Cold is Approaching; Relief Work Becomes Increasingly Urgent; Prices Soar, Relief Supplies Have Increased Eightfold; the Citizens' Group of the Relief Association Sends Letters Seeking Donations</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the Beginning of Winter, and severe cold is swiftly approaching. The Citizens' Group of the Relief Association, facing a sharp increase in relief supplies needed, is appealing to all sectors to continue making donations. The Three Teachings Morality Society, in charge of providing meals, has designated twenty locations for meal distribution and has appointed Wen Lanting as the honorary chairman. Youth associations and others are actively soliciting donations of winter clothing for the poor due to the cold weather. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand Refugees Still Sheltered</p>
<p>Since the increase in prices, citizens' living expenses have risen, leading to a sharp decrease in donations for disaster relief. Even the refugee donations collected from dance halls, restaurants, and hotels have declined month by month. The Citizens' Group of the Relief Association yesterday sent letters to all sectors, appealing for continued donations. The original text reads: "Since the launch of our association's fundraising campaign for disaster relief, we have been deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support from all sectors. Currently, due to rising prices, aside from the young and strong who have been sent away, there are still over ten thousand women, children, elderly, and disabled refugees being sheltered. The issue of providing them with supplies is extremely serious. When the incident occurred, the monthly cost of relief supplies per refugee was only two yuan. Now, it requires about sixteen yuan per person per month, an eightfold increase, which is still insufficient to keep them warm and fed. Their situation is even more difficult than before. We have always admired your kindness, compassion, and willingness to help others. Therefore, we dare to once again appeal to you, respectfully requesting that you consider the suffering of the disaster victims and continue to donate, so that relief work can be carried out thoroughly. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<p>Designated Locations for Meal Distribution</p>
<p>The impoverished relief work of providing porridge and rice by the Three Teachings Morality Council has not been interrupted. Last month, they also resumed their work of providing relief to orphans and widows. Once investigated and approved, they provide monthly living subsidies, which has been praised by all sectors. At the same time, due to the high prices, the lives of poor citizens have become precarious. Refugees on the streets are particularly miserable, suffering from hunger and cold as the biting winter wind approaches. Therefore, the meal distribution work has been widely promoted. Each voucher is good for one bowl of white rice. Twenty meal distribution locations have been designated so that the poor can redeem the vouchers nearby. They are located at: 25 Xinzha Road, 654 Chengdu Road, 345 Julu Road, 91 Zhejiang Road, 6 Yunnan Road, 36 Maigen Road, 420 Dapu Bridge Road, 222 Route Lafayette, 14 Jiaozhou Road, 493 Avenue Albert, 1542 Rue Robert, 4521 Route Cardinal Mercier, 407 Route Tenant de la Tour, 921 Dongyouheng Road, 166 North Shanxi Road, 447 Yuchiaching Road at the intersection of Route Picard, 52 Balizhuang Road, 307 Avenue Albert, 63 Luxiangyuan Road, 217 Wuzhou Road.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Solicitation of Winter Clothing for the Poor</p>
<p>In addition to the above relief work, the Three Teachings Society is also engaged in winter clothing work. In addition to accepting donations for distribution from all sectors, they also issue clothing vouchers, one set per voucher, sold for thirteen yuan, so that benevolent people can purchase and distribute them themselves. Recently, due to the soaring prices of cotton and cotton cloth, many unscrupulous merchants have attempted to purchase and hoard them. After the society discovered this, they refused to sell in bulk and added a stamp on the clothes for identification. They also requested all charitable organizations in the city to pay attention to prevention. Furthermore, the Christian Youth Association launched a campaign to solicit 30,000 yuan for winter clothing for the poor in Shanghai. Since the launch of the campaign, donations of cash and used clothing have been very enthusiastic. The association believes that as the weather gets colder, the poor should be spared from freezing and sickness. Therefore, they have decided to disinfect the used clothing this month and then distribute it to different districts. At the same time, considering the large number of poor people, they are appealing to all sectors to enthusiastically donate to complete the work.</p>
<h3>Puyi Arts and Crafts Society Solicits Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Missing 20,000 Yuan from Fundraising Target</p>
<p>The Puyi Arts and Crafts Society, in view of the approaching severe winter and the imminent threat of cold, believes that the original cotton clothes of the general elderly, weak, women, children, and impoverished disaster victims are old and torn, and not enough to keep them warm. If no active measures are taken, they will likely suffer from cold and hunger. Therefore, they are sincerely appealing, hoping that all sectors will maintain their past enthusiasm for disaster relief and provide assistance, either by donating cash or winter clothing, so that these people can have something to keep warm and survive the difficult times. Since the society launched the "50,000 Yuan" fundraising campaign last month, this newspaper has introduced it several times and appealed on its behalf, which has been met with enthusiastic support from all sectors, either by donating cash or clothing, so that the society's daily relief of over one thousand elderly, weak, sick, and impoverished disaster victims can have work and be free from worries about food and clothing. However, there is still a shortfall of more than 20,000 yuan from the target. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to donate. The donations received last week are listed below: Xie Weiqing raised 1,700 yuan, Taikoo Yang Weibin 200 yuan, Wang Yushu raised 1,000 yuan, Cao Maode 100 yuan, Li Chenshi's birthday gift 150 yuan, Xu Anqing raised 110 yuan, Qin Junji 500 yuan, Qingxin Girls' School continued to raise 5,811.55 yuan, Luo Jiabin raised 1,000 yuan, Shen Baochang raised 350 yuan, Chen Mao Yafeng 1,100 yuan, Dr. Yang Suzhen raised 1,100 yuan, Rongfeng Yarn Factory 100 yuan, Anonymous (handled by Wei Jun) 100 yuan, Xie Siliang raised 500 yuan, Juemin Primary School 500 yuan, Sun Linshu raised 327 yuan, Qian Xianchang 150 yuan, Teng Keqin raised 1,000 yuan, Ms. Chen Huizhen raised 1,005 yuan, He Dekui and 27 others a total of 574.04 yuan, 11 Westerners donated a total of 990 yuan, American company American Micro donated a large package of matches (worth 1,700 yuan), Jiuji (handled by Bian Fengzhu) donated 5 bolts of white cloth (worth 500 yuan). The society's office is located at 2nd floor, 25 Hankou Road (telephone 16082).</p>
<h3>Pudong Native Place Association Holds Autumn Festival Commemoration of Local Worthies</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Pudong Native Place Association on Route Edward held an autumn festival to commemorate local worthies. The ceremony was solemn and grand. Fellow natives and family members of the worthies gathered on the sixth floor to perform the rituals as required and delivered a memorial address, saying, "It is said that honoring merit and respecting virtue are guided by constant principles. Spring sacrifices and autumn feasts are long-standing precedents. This has always been the same in the past and present and is also a grand event in our native place. Thinking of our native place sages, who were blessed by the rivers and seas, and whose talents emerged from our hometown, we remember their exemplary conduct and add to the glory of our hometown. Some were upright officials and Confucian scholars, while others were skilled craftsmen and wealthy merchants. They extended themselves to others, united the community, sought public welfare, honored their ancestors, and passed on blessings to future generations. Only by accumulating good deeds can one bring down blessings. We model ourselves on gold and embroider with silk, respectfully observing their portraits. We enshrine them in our native place and sacrifice to them in our community, sharing bright sacrifices together. We respectfully offer pepper and fragrance, humbly hoping that they will accept our offerings. November 8th, 30th year of the Republic of China." After the ceremony, Mr. Zhang Bochun gave a speech on the meaning of the autumn festival, and Mr. Zhu Shaoqi reported on the association's affairs. Both expressed their hope that fellow natives would pay attention to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, maintain the inherent virtues of their native place, and abandon the extravagant habits of Shanghai. It is said that the association's affairs have been progressing smoothly in recent years.</p>
<p>Extension of the Fujian-Guangdong Telegram Communication Area</p>
<p>Since Fuzhou Lei Bao was recovered by the Chinese army, it has been sending and receiving telegrams as usual, and telegram registration has also been restored, providing a lot of convenience for telegram senders. According to the news from the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Company yesterday, a telegram from Fuzhou stated that telegrams to Lianjiang, Jiangle, Mawei Guantou, Changdou in Fujian Province, and Chaoyang in Guangdong Province can also be sent and received as usual from yesterday.</p>
<h3>Butcher Kills with Knife; Defendant Tried Yesterday at Court; Housewife Dies, Three Others Injured</h3>
<p>Chen Yin-nan, a Hebei native who used to be a section chief under Chen Tiaoyuan, moved to Shanghai with his family after the outbreak of the war and resided at No. 43, Lane 930, Fuxu Road, Cihui Nanli. He hired Wang Huan-zhang (52 years old), a fellow native, as a butcher. At 5:10 PM on the 7th of this month, Chen asked Wang to wash a pair of shorts. Wang then went to the drying platform and took a large bundle of firewood downstairs. At that time,</p>
<p>Chen's wife, Madam Shen,</p>
<p>criticized Wang for taking too much firewood. Wang refused to accept the criticism and argued back, which resulted in Madam Shen stopping him. Unexpectedly, Wang harbored resentment in his heart and rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and, without asking why, slashed Madam Shen's head, face, body, hands, and other parts. Her second daughter, Yun-fen, stepped forward to help her mother and was also slashed in the head. At the time, Chen Yin-nan and his eldest daughter, Yun-heng, heard the alarm and stepped forward to dissuade Wang, but Wang was like a madman</p>
<p>and slashed at anyone he encountered.</p>
<p>Chen's forehead, chest, wrist, and Yun-heng's head were all injured. None of the four family members were spared. His methods can be described as extremely vicious. Afterwards, Chinese constables No. 3148 and detective Wang Zhichao arrived, took the murderer and the kitchen knife into custody, and sent the four injured to the Red Cross Hospital. However, Madam Chen Shen's injuries were fatal, and she died shortly after. Her body was sent to the coroner's office. The other three were all</p>
<p>hospitalized for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Wang Huan-zhang was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The constable's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit according to law. Chen Yun-fen's injuries were relatively minor, and she also filed a case, stating the circumstances of the incident. Wang Huan-zhang stated that he was a distant relative of Chen and that he worked for Chen for a monthly salary of only five yuan. He had repeatedly requested to resign and return to his hometown, but Chen refused to give him travel expenses, which led to this tragedy. Judge Zhong postponed the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Significant Developments in the Xu Songyao Murder Case Yesterday; Coroner's Report Not Yet Released; Two Sisters Detained</h3>
<p>Regarding the shocking case of fratricide that has caused a sensation in society, after the coffin was opened for inspection yesterday in a small ward on Route Tenant de la Tour, there seems to be a major development in the case. The official result of the inspection by the legal authorities has not yet been released, but according to reliable sources, Xu Daquan is still in custody yesterday, and Xu Songyao's two sisters were also detained during the inspection.

There were five wounds on his head and one on his chest, which were one or two inches deep and were caused by a square-headed sharp weapon. The body of Zheng Xiangda, the carter whose cause of death was unknown, was also examined by a forensic doctor yesterday. There were no signs of poisoning on the surface.

<h3>Separate Pricing of Soybean Oil is Set; Mixing with Other Oils is Prohibited</h3>
<p>Since the French authorities set price limits on the retail price of soy sauce and alcohol shops in the city on August 11, the industry association has repeatedly reported to its members that the cost of goods has been rising. After several runs, the French Municipal Council's Price Stabilization Committee approved the temporary sale of these items at 2.96 yuan from November 6, starting on November 5. The association issued a notice that this selling price, though it still does not match the cost, is aimed to show consideration for the commoners, so members should not raise prices without authorization. The association yesterday also received a letter from the French Municipal Council's Price Stabilization Committee prohibiting the mixing of other oils. According to investigations, one catty equals 500 grams.</p>
<h3>Washington Watch Store Robbed, Significant Losses; Over 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At around 7:10 PM last night, the Washington Watch and Optical Store at 44 Jing'an Temple Road was robbed. Just after the store had closed, three robbers suddenly broke in through the back door. Two of them were wearing long gowns, and one was wearing a suit. At the time, only one employee was sweeping the store. The robbers rushed inside, took out firearms, and forbade him from making any noise. One robber ran upstairs and forced all the staff and apprentices upstairs to hand over the keys to the display case. Then, one person was imprisoned in a room, and one robber stood guard with a gun at the door. The remaining two robbers went downstairs, opened the display cases and small storage boxes (which contained many gold watches and pocket watches worth over a thousand yuan each), and looted for about half an hour before leaving. Afterwards, the store estimated that the loss of precious watches was about six or seven hundred, estimated to be worth over 200,000 yuan. After the robbers left, they reported to the Xinwen Police Station, which ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and track down the robbers.</p>
<h3>YMCA William Hall Opens Tomorrow; Commemorating William Locke</h3>
<p>In order to commemorate the late American staff member William Locke, the Shanghai YMCA recently had friends of Locke jointly raise funds to build a William Locke Prayer Hall on the second floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge, dedicated to group or private religious worship. Locke came to China from the United States in 1903 and immediately became a staff member of the YMCA. Locke firmly believed in Christ and devoted his life to religious work, especially in the training of talents, the current reorganization, and the promotion of the development of the National YMCA Association. He contributed greatly. There are about 40 YMCAs established in various parts of China, and Locke had a hand in them. He loved to write throughout his life and often used Chinese issues to promote in American newspapers and magazines. He was very sympathetic to the difficulties faced by our country and nation and deeply hoped that our government and people would become stronger. His wish was to dedicate his life to China. In the winter of 1936, he died in Shanghai due to overwork and illness, having served the Shanghai YMCA for 33 years. Diligent and dedicated, he was like one day for decades. In order to leave a permanent memory, the YMCA built this public prayer hall. The entire project was designed by architect Li Jinpei and constructed by Jiang Yuji. It took years to complete. Although its scale is not very large, every detail has been carefully planned and meticulously managed, making it a model public prayer hall in the Far East. The YMCA has scheduled to hold a dedication ceremony with religious rites at 5:00 PM tomorrow (the 10th). At the same time, a memorial service will be held, and religious figures will be invited to participate. The ceremony will be grand, and there is sure to be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Labor Strike at Zhejiang, Lafayette, and Other Cinemas; Screenings Suspended</h3>
<p>Cinema workers in this city once launched a labor strike in mid-August of this year due to low wages and demands for improved treatment. However, it was only a one-hour work stoppage. After negotiations between the employer and the workers, the problem was resolved. However, the four cinemas operated by Jewish merchants: Zhejiang, Lafayette, Amon, and Dumei, had not reached a formal solution, so the matter has been delayed until now. Recently, the workers of the above four cinemas requested a general subsidy increase of ten yuan from the employer, starting this month, because prices were rising daily and it was difficult to maintain a living. Because the employer did not respond, the projectionists of the four cinemas went on strike yesterday afternoon and were late to the cinemas. As a result, the 2:30 PM screenings at each cinema could not be opened. Except for Amon, which had already increased the subsidy by twenty yuan, and did not close, the other three cinemas refunded tickets and suspended business, and posted "Temporarily Closed" signs at the gate. It is reported that the labor-management negotiations were still ongoing last night, and the cinemas may be able to resolve the issue and reopen today.</p>

<p>Wang Youlin, a shop assistant at the Sheng Rice Shop at 173 Chongching Road, was found to be hiding four bags of Municipal Council's low-priced rice and refusing to sell them. He was arrested by Chinese Deputy Constable Jiang Mouzheng and detective Xu Dezhong of the Chengdu Road Police Station and sent to court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong of the First Special District Court presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Wang Youlin was found guilty of monopolizing designated goods and sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and fined 400 yuan. The four bags of Hong Kong rice that were seized were ordered to be handed over to a trusted rice shop by the police station to be sold as low-priced rice. The proceeds from the rice sale were to be handed over to the court for storage.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Apprentice Steals; Father and Son Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>

Last month, Chen was dismissed by the shop owner Zhang Guisheng for stealing from the shop. On the evening of the 6th of this month, Chen broke into the shop again, opened the iron box, and stole 8,119 yuan in legal tender, 690 yuan in Japanese currency, and four passbooks, totaling 11,721.76 yuan. He took the money to his father, Chen Jiasheng's, place at 690 Xiaiweis Road (who was the gatekeeper there). The incident was reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station by Zhang Guisheng, who sent detective Ni Runsen to bring Chen Guoqi and his father Chen Jiasheng, along with all the stolen goods, to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to law. After interrogation, Chen Guoqi was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and Chen Jiasheng was sentenced to ten months of imprisonment. The embezzled funds were returned.</p>

<h3>How to Commemorate the Founding Father's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>In two days—November 12th, it will be our Founding Father's birthday, so all schools will have a day off and hold a grand ceremony.</p>
<p>The Founding Father initiated the revolution and led many revolutionary heroes. After forty years of difficult and arduous struggle, the Republic of China was established. Therefore, his birthday can be said to be the birthday of the country. The history of his life is also the history of the birth of the country.</p>
<p>Now, when we commemorate the Founding Father's birthday, we should learn his revolutionary spirit: He devoted himself to the revolution, unafraid of difficulties and dangers, for forty years as one day. He failed ten times, but he was not discouraged at all. He continued to struggle constantly. Finally, the autocratic Qing Dynasty was overthrown, and the Republic of China was established. His spirit of perseverance and his courage to never give up are worthy of our admiration and imitation.</p>
<p>When we commemorate the Founding Father's birthday, we must also learn his spirit of patriotism. For the freedom and equality of the motherland, he appealed and worked tirelessly, exhausting his efforts until the last minute of his death, and still shouting loudly, "Peace! Struggle! Save China!" This spirit of loving the country is what we must follow. Especially in this time of such serious national crisis, how should children learn his spirit and struggle to build the country?</p>
<p>When we commemorate the Founding Father's birthday, we must also learn his studious spirit: He loved to read books the most. When supervising the battle on the front lines, he still carried books with him. Therefore, he was able to write many books, such as the Three Principles of the People, the Strategy of National Reconstruction, and the Outline of National Reconstruction, to instruct us on how to save and build the country. He often said to people: "In my life, besides revolution, reading is my only hobby. If I don't read for a day, I cannot live." Now that we are children who are studying, how should we encourage ourselves and emulate our Founding Father?</p>
<h3>How to Be Filial</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In today's declining moral climate, filial piety is indeed a topic worthy of discussion. Generally, sons don't even consider filial piety, let alone take their parents seriously. It's not uncommon to see people beating their parents; a few harsh words are a minor matter.</p>
<p>Recently, the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, to promote filial piety, held a filial piety week and solicited essays from students of various schools. The given topics were "How to Be Filial?" and "My Parents." I originally considered having the students in my class participate, but due to time constraints, I abandoned the idea.</p>
<p>However, afterward, I still gave them the above two topics in composition class. Of the thirty-odd students, more than two-thirds chose the "How to Be Filial?" topic. After grading the papers, I found that their opinions could be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Listen to your parents and don't go against them, causing them unhappiness.</p>
<p>Study hard and achieve good grades, which will make your parents happy.</p>
<p>If your parents have things they are not satisfied with, you should persuade and comfort them.</p>
<p>During these extraordinary times, all expenses should be saved; be aware of the difficulty your parents have in earning money.</p>
<p>When your parents are sick, personally brew medicine for them and visit them often.</p>
<p>Well, during the student years, one only spends money and doesn't earn it, so there's no talk of supporting parents. But being able to do the above few points can also be considered filial piety, right?</p>
<h3>The Greatest Beauty</h3>
<p>— Niu Huiren</p>
<p>"What is the most beautiful?" I think, if I were to ask this question, children would have many answers. Red and yellow chrysanthemums are the most beautiful, or maple leaves redder than February flowers are the most beautiful, or colorful tropical fish are the most beautiful... Right? Which one is the most correct? Wrong, I think they are all only partially correct. Then, the children must ask in surprise: "What is the most beautiful?"</p>
<p>Listen, there are two kinds of beauty, one is the beauty of form and color, and the other is the beauty of spirit. The common beauty, the beauty of flowers, moon, insects, and birds, is the beauty of form. That is superficial beauty, temporary beauty, which is very small. Strictly speaking, it cannot really be considered beauty. True beauty is the beauty of spirit—love. The French maiden Joan of Arc loved her country and sacrificed herself to lead the people in resisting the enemy, finally saving the country from danger. Her love, how great and beautiful it is! Florence Nightingale loved humanity, braving the dangers of bullets and gunfire to care for the wounded soldiers on the battlefield, establishing the nursing system, so that wounded soldiers and patients all over the world have since been comforted. Her love, how great and beautiful it is!</p>
<p>Remember, the most beautiful thing in the world is "love." Love is the purest beauty, the most permanent beauty. Each of you has a love in your heart. May you love your parents, love your society, love your country, love all of humanity, and establish your greatest beauty!</p>
<h3>The Spider and the Butterfly</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>A spider was spinning a web on a tree, but because the wind was too strong, it couldn't spin it well after a long time. But it wasn't discouraged at all, only focusing on spinning the web wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Its friend, the butterfly, flew over and said to it: "Brother Spider, you are too foolish. The wind is so strong that no matter how capable you are, you won't be able to spin it well. Why not come and play with me!"</p>
<p>But the spider was determined to not play until it was done well. It replied to the butterfly: "Sister Butterfly, spinning the web is my responsibility. I must spin it well. Although the wind is strong, I am not afraid. I have the strength to struggle. What's the point of living a life like yours, dressed in fancy clothes, wandering around all day, playing here and there?" After speaking, it continued to spin its web...very resolutely, so the butterfly flew away in disappointment.</p>
<p>The wind gradually subsided, and the spider finished spinning its web, leisurely sitting in the middle of the web.</p>
<p>The butterfly came again, and it saw the spider and said in surprise: "Brother Spider, you are really capable, you actually succeeded in spinning it."</p>
<p>The spider replied calmly: "Sister Butterfly, you are young and don't know, let me tell you: This is not because of my ability, but because I have patience. As long as one is willing to be patient, don't be discouraged by the initial setbacks. If you fail the first time, there is a second time; if you fail the second time, there is a third time... If you keep doing it with perseverance, you will succeed eventually. So patience is the foundation of success!"</p>
<p>The butterfly was very moved by what the spider said and flew away to do things.</p>
<p>Therefore, dear children, you must always be patient when doing things. The spider mentioned above is a good model for you to follow:</p>
<h3>The First Monthly Exam</h3>
<p>— Hu Depei</p>
<p>The busy monthly exam has come to an end all at once today. The results are not yet known in detail.</p>
<p>I remember that before the exam, my mind was always preoccupied with the monthly exam, so my face always wore a look of fear, as if a great disaster was about to befall me. I spent all my time on books, preparing for the exam.</p>
<p>During the exam, the teachers were very serious and set many difficult questions, making us rack our brains and bury ourselves in doing them. The time was set to only forty minutes each time. After the time was up, we were no longer allowed to delay for a moment. And the seats of each person were all swapped to prevent cheating. The teachers are truly meticulous in order to improve our academic level.</p>
<p>Now the exam is over, and the panic of many days has disappeared like smoke. How happy! However, in the blink of an eye, the second monthly exam will follow closely. How should we work hard!</p>
<h3>Clothing (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>When metabolism occurs, a lot of heat is generated, so we are always warm. If we wear too few clothes, the heat is transmitted to the body and dissipated to the surrounding air, and you will feel even colder. So when the weather gets cold, wear more clothes. These clothes are like a layer of wall, blocking the heat emitted from your body and preventing it from dissipating, and keeping it all around your body, so you feel much warmer. Among clothes, wool is the warmest, because wool sweaters are very loose. When worn, they have many empty spaces to store the heat emitted from the body. That's why we wear cotton robes in winter, right! Have you ever seen your mother often sun-drying winter clothes and beating them with a rattan beater in the sun? What's the reason for this? …</p>
<p>"I know that, because clothes often have moths hiding in them that damage the clothes. Sunning them can kill them, and beating them with a rattan beater is to scare out the moths hiding in the inner layer of the clothes, so they can be killed one by one, and the clothes will no longer be damaged by moths," said A Liang搶着.</p>
<p>"That's not wrong, but there's another reason. Beating can not only remove the dust from the clothes, but also make the inner layer of the clothes very loose, because they have always been pressed in the box, pressed very tightly. When worn in winter, they don't feel very warm. After being beaten, the inner layer of the clothes can be loosened, and there can be many gaps inside to store the body's heat. That's the same reason!"</p>
<p>After A Liang's father finished saying these many words, he was about to go out with his mother to buy some winter clothing materials. A Liang clamored to go too. Anyway, today is Sunday, so take him with them. So they took a tram to the bustling center. In less than half an hour, they stepped into a cloth shop with three storefronts.</p>
<p>"This year's clothing materials are really unbelievably expensive. This piece of fake wool also costs tens of dollars." As they only bought one piece of clothing material and walked out, his father muttered like this. He originally wanted to buy a few more pieces, but he didn't know that the money he brought out was barely enough to buy one good piece of clothing material, so he chose a piece of clothing material with a similar price and that was it. A Liang's idea of making new clothes also became a bubble. They stepped back on the tram and returned home.</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Handling the Arhats in "Thinking of the Mundane"</h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>The "Thinking of the Mundane" from the Kunqu opera *Niehai Ji* is a solo performance. Although it is performed by one person on stage, it has a clear and elegant charm, is substantial without being vulgar, and the tone is soft and beautiful, and the rhythm is round, vigorous, light, and agile. The performance of this nun who is detached from the mundane world has intricate and subtle movements, beautiful postures, and many key points and mysteries, showing the wonderfulness of complexity and change. Without sufficient skill, it is difficult to sing and act properly. Therefore, it requires all kinds of grace and proper behavior to be considered a masterpiece.</p>
<p>I have seen "Thinking of the Mundane" performed by Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Zhu Chuanming, Han Shichang, and Xu Lao Taitai, a female amateur performer in Shanghai. The number of times inside and outside the profession must be more than ten, and they all gave me considerable satisfaction. This shows the preciousness of Kunqu opera. Although there are some who simply rush around the stage, pretending to be reserved, waving their sleeves and dusting off, doing whirlwind dances, and whose facial expressions are hurried like a rushing torrent, those are all wild fox Zen and are not to be taken as the standard.</p>
<p>Anyone who plays *Sekong* must have pure skill, skillful posture, and express sensuality moderately. In interpreting the plot, it should be joyous without being unrestrained. The movements of the water sleeves, the control and elevation of the duster, must be in harmony with the rhythm between slowness and speed. The appearance must be proper while the spirit moves, and the eyebrows must want to fly while the expression dances. It is especially necessary to maintain the true, good, and beautiful without being carved out of innate vitality in order to reach a wonderful state.</p>
<p>In the performance of singing the "Shan Po Yang" section "The little nun is only eighteen years old... Let's just focus on the present," all the actions performed at this time must be like spring clouds emerging from the mountains and flowing water circling, with not being bound by appearances as the supreme skill.</p>
<p>The performance of this section must fully express the *Sekong* who lives alone, the deep lock of the Zen gate, the surging of romantic thoughts, the realization that life is empty, and the sudden awakening, which cannot be suppressed, that "Only the living suffer, and never see the dead wearing shackles," and "Doing homework for the underworld for nothing," so she decides to escape, so from the scripture hall to the two corridors, to the mountain gate, her expression, thoughts, and steps are all tense. The steps to escape down the mountain are like a startled swan, flying like a swallow, and have the wonder of Yiliao juggling balls and Gongsun dancing with swords.</p>
<p>In the Arhat Hall, playing with makeup and costumes, with all kinds of appearances, five colors and ten colors, shining with dancing sleeves and singing shirts, the arrangement of the stage is essential. However, after the little nun goes down the mountain, the Arhats still stand in rows. This point should be considered. My idea is, in singing "...That old eyebrow immortal worries about me, saying what will happen to me when I am old... I can't be in a decorated pavilion..." After singing this section, she should make a gesture of walking out of the mountain, and at the same time close the stage curtain. After the stage curtain is closed, it is good to make the Arhats leave the stage, and then *Sekong* continues to sing "I tear my cassock..." Take off the cassock and continue performing down the mountain. As for the little monk going down the mountain, I have seen Hua Chuanhao's performance, and I really can't find a second person. It is said that he learned from Lu Shouqing's style.</p>

<p>— 頋 Mingdao</p>
<h3>Chapter 19: At Dusk, Hu Cavalry Filled the City with Dust</h3>
<p>I had to defend against the Qing soldiers on one side, and resist the roaming bandits on the other, turning into a situation where I was attacked from both sides, and I felt very distraught. The other day, I suddenly received an order from General Wu, instructing me to immediately withdraw from Ningyuan and retreat to Shanhaiguan as scheduled. He had already begged the Qing court for assistance to jointly suppress the roaming bandits. So I had no choice but to obey the order and lead my subordinates back to Shanhaiguan to report to General Wu. Because I missed you all, I immediately ran to Jiuchengkou to visit and talk. Who knew that when I arrived at the camp gate, I couldn't find you anywhere. A soldier reported that he had seen you sitting on horses and taking luggage away. I was a little suspicious, wondering if you had left without saying goodbye. Fortunately, you hadn't gone far, so I took two riders and immediately chased after you. I am glad that we can still meet. Alas! Zhang, my dear brother, why did you leave like this?" Zhang Cangqiu sneered and said, "Brother Chai, are you asking us why we left Shanhaiguan? Alas! The four of us came here to join the army from thousands of miles away, originally holding a bit of enthusiasm for General Wu. Unfortunately, General Wu's actions now are not in line with our thinking, so to be honest, we are unwilling to serve under him anymore. Because Brother Chai was far away in Ningyuan, we heard that you were about to withdraw, and we didn't have time to wait. Please forgive us." Chen Fei also said, "This is something that could not be avoided. You, my old brother, understand all the things that General Wu is doing. A clear person doesn't need to go into details." Chai Wu nodded when he heard them say this, and said, "I also guessed that you left because General Wu begged the Qing court for assistance. General Wu's move is of course somewhat akin to seeking skin from a tiger, not understanding the situation. (124)</p>
<h3>Film Subtitles Self-Made by Chinese People</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The printing of subtitles on domestic films (such as song lyrics, etc.) was originally exclusively handled by a German company. Since Shen Tianyin and others initiated the China Electrical Subtitle Company in March, with excellent results, the subtitle work of China United, Jin Xing, Yi Hua, Guo Hua, Min Hua, and other companies has been completely taken over by the China Electrical Company. From now on, this business in the hands of foreign merchants will be in the hands of the Chinese people.</p>
