<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國副元首赫斯的出亡</h3>
<p>民主與獨裁政制的優劣，是一個陳舊的爭論問題。論者見仁見智，迄無一致的定論，即就此次歐戰經騐來看，則德國的內部一致，運用靈活，正與法國的聚訟盈廷，應付遲滯，形成明顯的對照；而英美的民主政體，在嚴重的試騐之下，亦復證明其確具有顚撲不破的特長。至如此次德國副元首赫斯出亡到英國這種事，敢信其必不致在民主國家發生，而這也正是獨裁政制的重大弱點所在。</p>
<p>赫斯此度出亡的眞因和動機，至今尙未大白，但就海通社所傳國社檔公報來看，無疑在他和德國現當局之間，正存在着重大的意見分歧，所謂精神錯亂身忠重病等則顯屬掩飾的託詞。直到出亡之日為止，赫斯始終是國社黨副黨魁，希特勒的代表兼第二繼承人，就政治責任而言，地位固不如戈林以至李賓特洛夫者流之煊赫，而在黨的組織方面，希特勒以外還無人可和他比並，德國正値對外作戰的緊急時期，這樣重大的職務，總不會始終委之於一個精神小健的痼病患者吧！以赫斯權勢之重，地位之高，他所懷有的個人小同見解，在黨內且不容盡情傾吐，終致出於獨身出亡一途，則地位不若赫斯者以至一般人民當更可知，相信此際在德國，和赫斯具有同感者正復不知尙有幾許，只是他們連出亡國外的機會都無從獲得而已。在從前，世人往往對於納粹組織能力估量過低，一似其不久即當以內部矛盾而崩潰；到去夏西綫獲勝之後，又復估量過高，更沒有人對於納粹內部寄以何等幻想。其實希特勒的統治，固不致像一盤散沙，當亦非天衣無縫，只是一方當局統制壓迫過嚴，另方人民又怵於上次戰敗後屈辱的慘痛，乃在表面上保持着完整和一致：絕不是已往直到一九三二總投票時還反對着納粹的最大多數德國人民現在都成為希特勒的忠誠擁護者，也不是此際德方每一人民都服膺着窮兵黷武的侵略政策。然而現在德國的陰暗面，已經由赫斯的出亡而開始暴露了。</p>
<p>現在歐戰正在繼續演進中，而且軸心愈佔優勢，則樹敵愈多，戰局愈廣，以是此際任何人都不敢預言何時何地纔是戰局的止境。這固然是全世界的不幸，但究以身處戰事核心的德國所受痛苦為最甚。一九三三年希特勒之所以獲得多數票選而登台，是因為他對於德人發出之擺脫凡爾賽枷鎖的幸福預的，以是其武裝來因，收回薩爾，都適足形成奠定其政權的有力武器。及其合併奧國，攫取捷克，則業已逾越湔恥的範圍，人民所得却只是强迫以牛油換取大砲，乃至爆發大戰，席捲歐陸全部，且公然標榜「新秩序」，以改造歐洲甚至改造全世界為最後歸趨，此其種種，縱或一時尙能對於內部收到刺激或興奮之效，但距離湔恥求存的初衷巳日益遙遠，即在希特勒自身，最近的幾次講演亦復陳陳相因了無新義足資號召。更何况上次大戰去今未遠，即在此際戰爭獲得若干勝利之餘，摸索昔日創痛，也難免小引起若干慘痛回憶，因而减消對於希特勒所標榜勝利的憧憬。最近發生的這一裂痕，在表面上也許是戰爭與反對戰爭的爭執，其本質則為夢想征服世界者在內部所必然發生的反響，這是浸略者無可避免的命運，另一方面，也就是赫斯之所以不同於葵士林的地方。</p>
<p>不過，目前德國即使巳有此種裂痕存在，其醖釀則並未成熟，赫斯的隻身出亡可資佐證：假使此一反希特勒的企圖眞有成功的把握，則此際出亡國外者必非赫斯而是其他納粹當局人物。希特勒在一九三四年能以殘酷的屠殺鎭壓羅姆等急進派的反側，則此際當亦不難運用非常手段彌縫其內部裂痕，雖然此次裂痕的性質並不能過分輕視。</p>
<p>去年五月十日正是納粹軍隊開始西綫攻勢的光榮日子，今年此日乃竟有副元首出亡敵國的悲喜劇發生，這一對比顯然暗示着侵略者盛極而衰的趨勢；假使希特勒在最近的將來還不能有打開戰事僵局並擊潰英國的決勝良策，則一九一八年的覆轍未必竟不再重演，最近的事實正暗示着德國內部巳有這種醖釀存在。</p>

<h3>歐戰業叢談（五五）　墨索里尼的沒落</h3>
<p>義大利軍隊在菲洲戰敗崁，國內情景日非，一世之雄的墨索里尼變成希特勒的附庸。ChristianScience　Monitor駐羅馬訪員台稚斯新近返翻，為該報撰文數篇，暢論義大利內幕，頗多珍貴材料，下文即其一篇</p>
<p>羅馬一位有櫃威的中立觀察家會崔今年二月初對人說過，「這個年頭，義大利已沒有負責的政府，甚麼事情都會發生。」</p>
<p>這句話道蓿了詼隨斯政府當前的弱點。羅馬的人們都知道阿菲利加帝國的破裂，榮膺「帝國創造者」銜頭的墨索里尼已被公朋喚作「帝國毀減者」了。</p>
<p>政府大部份要員都已出發前綫各地，留在羅馬的次級官吏們渴望和墨索里尼接觸，請示大計，但都嘗了閉門羹，革命陰謀一觸即發。</p>
<p>「墨索里尼那裹去了？」政局愈益混亂，大家也愈加追究着這一疑問。</p>
<p>原來墨索里尼正在度羞一倘空前難關。與他接近的人說，首相精神遭受重大刺激，一時難以複原。所鐫刺激當然是指義國在菲洲的敗續呃言。另一位知他底細的人說，他在公私方面都已失去常態。</p>
<p>另據少數會見墨索里尼的人說，首相至少已和他幾個最親信的顧問發生齟齬，他把義大利的挫敗，推在各個別人身上。不僅此也，他對於當前的危局簡直一籌莫展。他唯一的山路只有跟著德國孤注一擲，為望補國戰勝筷，在歐洲的栽局向中，分潤一杯羹。但是這種辦洗顯然是個下繁，徒然把義大利淪為德國附席，奉行柏林的命令而已</p>
<p>我在離開羅馬前兩星期，會聽說墨索里尼已把他最忠實的老同志法利那西（曾任法西斯黨秘書長）也打發走了。中樞要員既然出走一空，留下的蝦兵蟹將不免手忙腳亂，他黴都沒有發號施令的衛力，只坏釀墨素星尼一個人去網命蓬搏鬥了。</p>
<p>我把墨索里尼作為話題，非欲聳動聽聞，實有其不相不然的理由。第一，義國參戰以來，墨索里尼已成為個人的獨裁者，故欲叔述義國目下境况，不可不集中於墨索里尼。第二，由於墨索里尼個人的損毀，德國政治警察和技術家們始得以援助為名，實行控制義國的樞紐，使墨索里尼只有忠於希特勒一條路可走。</p>
<p>話雖如此，墨索里尼的政權暫時還不致壽終正寢，穗國正源源供給「水門汀」去替他鞏固基礎。德國方面承認墨索里尼是義大利方面最好的朋友，否則換了別人上台，勢多轉而趨附英國的危險。</p>
<p>我捫有種種理由可信希特勒準備履約援助墨索里尼至相當時期，以便替他的「老大哥」撑一些傷面。不過痛苦只有法西斯黨領袖們肚裹得知，正如一位該黨某要人搥胸向人訴說「我沮喪極了。」</p>
<p>墨案里尼的政治病殆可有復原的一日，正如他過失在政治舞台的忽隱忽現一般。但在羅馬街頭高喊「墨索里尼完了」的現在，決不能使他振作，却也是一定無疑的。</p>
<p>墨索里尼對於希特勒並非全無認識。他初次和希特勒會面的詩候，曾回顧他的佳婿現任外交部長齊亞諾說道，「希特勒這個人，我在必要時可以和他合作。但希特勒和我決不能肺腑相交。」</p>
<p>墨索里尼道種見解從未變更，直至義國戰敗之際，法西斯黨人還愛單獨行動，常使柏林方面極感棘手。墨索里尼和希特勒每次會議後所發表的公報雖稱，「雙方見解完全一致，」但墨索里尼妄想施展手段，冀與希特勒分庭抗禮，也是無人不知的。</p>
<p>那麼墨索里尼為什麼目隨希特勒殼中，不惜孤注一擲呢？這要回想到昔年墨索里尼阻止希特勒併吞奧地利不成，向齊亞諾所講的話了。</p>
<p>「總有一天，」他說，「德國在歐洲所向無敵。那時我將和德國締結同盟。」</p>
<p>一九三九年五月，墨索里尼所希冀的「一天」果然到了。德國外交卻長里賓特洛浦和希特勒先後告訴他說，德國已有百戰百勝的把握。里賓特洛浦且曾說明德軍依次征服挪威，荷蘭，比利時，法國和英國的計劃呢。</p>
<p>德國依照計劃進行，直到打敗法國為止，絲毫不爽。墨索里尼覺得自己眞的料事如神，未免情不自禁起來了。在先他原批評別人「險象環生，」這時自己也準備依樣葫蘆了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼是個重實行的人，他自認過失之餘，力作亡羊補牢之計。在我離開羅馬前夕，有位外交家對我說，「墨索里尼不顧一切，越發瘋在地親德了，希望藉此挽救自己的地位。」</p>
<p>墨索里尼最近一次在德國某地會見希特勒，正是義大利軍在里比　慘敗之後，有人見他上火車時，滿腔悒鬱，什麼人都使他光火。但到回來時，他又復笑容可掬，宛如平時了</p>
<p>但墨索里尼究竟今昔不同了。</p>
<p>據羅馬人傳說，有人在某日發現墨索里尼在辦公廳長，持着一柄雨傘。</p>
<p>「可是並不下雨呢，」一個朋友提醒他說。</p>
<p>「是的，」墨索里尼回答說，「但柏林正下著雨呀！」</p>

<h3>糧食　工部局公賣米　首批五萬包已到齊　洋米微跌粳米仍上漲</h3>
<p>工部局採銷仰光小絞洋米、第一次五千噸、業到齊、第一批一萬一千一百餘包、分裝太古漢陽輪、怡和明生輪、自香港運來、星期日（十一日）到埠、各情已迭誌本報、茲悉太古太原輪亦裝一萬包、江蘇輪亦裝一萬五千包、兩輪同於十二日傍晚到埠、現均起卸完竣、前後四輪共裝來五萬六千一百餘包、合計已超過五千噸、故第一次採銷之洋米、業巳全數到滬、嗣後可絡繹運來民食無虞、價亦可賤矣、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨市又見直綫下遊、現米上下午共小三元許、期米則上午小一二元、下午小二三元、趨勢更爲軟弱無神、蓋市上利於多方之謠言已因港米五萬多包已全部到申、即將發售而消泯、港米第二批已在接洽外、尙有越米平賣首批亦在月中到申之公佈、加之市上存米百數十萬包之外、四五月份期米之大量籌碼又將接連來滬、供量旣如此之多、銷路均在觀望待小中、浮囤散多與力量不足守心不堅者莫不急急貶價求脫、因此各米開市後跌風甚厲、小絞米自一百十七元開價後即半元一元降小至一百十五元、午後再度趨自一百十五兀小至一百十三元、碎米中决者小至八十元、且與西貢火絞下午未經售開、而市氣則須再小一二元、英牟司更爲疲弱難振、西貢一號四五月上午開一百四十三元半、下午降至一百三十九元、碎米上午小至一百十元〇五角、下午只還價十元〇八角許、則比前日小四五六元矣、全日成交現米一萬五千包、期七百多噸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米其來源因自此决突起暴跌之風後、搬運者大都停手、致到貨寥落、手　均堅持不肯輕脫、同時本鄉店舖等作客見市面已呈盤旋之局、均思乘此進貨、銷塲遂覺活絡、厚薄兩粳行情即升二元左右、計開錫粳百四十元、崑山白粳高自百三十八元决至百三十五兀、南港早晚稻高自百三十六元、次至百三十二三元、原包百三十八元半百三十八元、</p>
<p>糯米去路依然不廣僅飯擔等零星胃口、致際洋米疲弱之間、形勢並見帶軟、計開香港白元百十七元三角百十七元、檽菉百零七八元、</p>
<p>粉市依然下游</p>
<p>現洋粉市况、依然下游、蓋以米價步跌不已、及洋粉定貨逐到聲中、人心終屬虛弱、故市面一小、進戶頓時袖手旁觀、如花鳥鐘樓牌澳粉均乏受主、僅金龍牌及砲台粉兩種點綴而已、金龍粉開盤尙須三十元零八角半、嗣即鬆至七角六角五角、砲合牌三十一元至三十元零九角五分、成交的有五六千包、市面前途須待實銷開展、方有回甦之望、華廠平賣粉仍爲二十九元、惟運日粉市步跌之際、本街需要亦不貪取、聞必要時廠盤亦將改低云、</p>
<p>小麥交易、停頓如常、蓋以內地來貨早已斷檔、各粉廠原料、亦均待新麥上市、再行收買、僅日廠方面門市偶有收進、價已降低一二元、聞高杜麥價爲四十六七元、市面尙須看小云、</p>

<h3>上海企業公司　業已清算解散</h3>
<p>一年以還，在上海猶太人主持下公開募集之新創洋股，先後不下六七種之多，而最先招募成立之上海企業公司，至上星期六經董事會議決，以自動淸算聞，是亦上海洋股市塲之小滄桑也。</p>
<p>考上海企業公司初爲私人公司，其股份係國際信託及揚子銀公司各半占有，蓋由兩公司所擁之若干不動產，撥充資本者也。一年前，經利安洋行之手，以每股五元五角（票面五元）之價格，向外界出售股份十八萬股，其餘十四萬股仍在二公司之手。嗣爲擴充營業起見，不久復增募新股六十萬〇五千股，並將管理權由譚史龐會計師移至會德豐。在去年下半期中，該股市價常在叫五元之間，今春發給去年度股息一分，市價稍稍上漲。</p>
<p>最近該公司通函各股東，以所有不動產均已次第售去，本來該公司以賣買不動產為主要業務，目下鑒於購置上海不動產者，大都為僑居上海以外之人，彼等別有目的，收益非其所問，故價格日高，經營者無　可圖，因此擬放棄此項業務，專以投資及賣買本市股票爲業，或即從事淸算，以此二事徵求股東意見，以決今後行止云。</p>
<p>根據該公司此次通函，知目下公司有現金二百六十五萬元，各種活動資產包括本市股東在內，按照四月二十五日收市市價，約值四百〇一萬六千八百二十元，如決定繼續營業，則擬發中期息一元，如決定解散淸算，則擬以現金及所握大部份之國際信託股份搭配潑還各股東云。</p>
<p>乃者該公司竟決定淸算解散矣，按該公司股份共爲九十二萬五千股，今決定於五月下旬每股先發本年盈利一元二角半，其餘候召集股東特別會議後，即從事清算。雖則目下外股市價，較四月二十五日跌落許多，如國際信託本週統計價格，祗合二十七元許，計小二元有餘。該公司所有資產，當然隨之跌落。但就大致言，除盈利外，似儘可收回原本也。（按照四月二十五日市價估計，如解散則每股財產的値七元左右。）（宣文）</p>

<h3>掉期後　金市仿佛</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、値本屆五月轉入六月掉期日、於晨八時光景已開始預做、由賣方貼出予買方初喊四十元、後聞巨多新豐永·大豐·鑫源·成記均觀望不前、貼價逐步見抬竟至五十元、始有正式成交、義豐德孚巨額貼出、恒記亦貼出、價遂步高至五十七元、八時十五分掛脾、由賣方貼出五十五元、後新豐永·成記·大來均前來貼進、續見退至五十元·最後五十二三元、六月期於九時十五分登塲、因各方人心恍忽、呈先漲後跌勢、六千五百元大關衝出後即回入、乃外匯先緊後鬆、證券幫金號匯票商猛進後、均來復出、午刻更傳美衆院已通過護航議案、更有美元减低成色說、故價由六千四百七十元、盤升至六千五百十八元、於午刻驟然在退至六千四百元關口、終因外匯未鬆軋平、故復起五六十元、收市掉期不計軋小六十九元、半日交易共的十萬兩、下午週三無市、塲外價已回升至六千四百七十元、現金聯興售予萬豐二十兩、價照六月期交價高二百元、祥和出成記五十吧、高一百九十元、比上日少加十元、若加掉期等共須軋低八十元、首飾金掛小五元、計六百八十五元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>六月期昨已上塲</p>
<p>自晨六月期九點十五分開市、爲六千叫百八十元、比上日（五月）收價低三十五元、若加掉期、賣方貼出五十三元、則開高十八元、買方更得勢活動、新豐永·成記加碼力進、德孚補空、益大爭購、價續哄至六千四百九十元、大豐·恒記忽來出籠、　泰永亦賣、抑退至六千四百七十兀、爲熾大·誠達·新豐永力進、抬上至六千四百九十元左右、稍有盤旋、距至十點三刻、外匯報緊、六月美金五元三四三七五亦難結、人心更堅、鑫源·大豐·德孚猛進、浮空傾斬、賣戶束手、價遂飛出六千五百元外、達六千五白十八兀、十一點十分後公和·德大猛出、且有利空傳說、外匯報硬、大豐·益大·新豐永亦來猛售、散多四起脫手、一時買戶絕跡、價退人六千五百元內、下跌更銳、竟步降一百餘元、跌至六千四百十元、爲益大。新豐永復進、抬上至六千四百四十元、及悉六月美金五元四〇六二五亦難賣、售者更踴躍、益大·德大·大豐再賣、在退至六千四百元關口、後聞美金向結仍僅五元三四三七五、市勢轉堅、新豐永·晋元·宏慶永散戶力進、一霎時提升至六千四百六十元、爲大豐·益大再出、遜至六千四百三十五元、正午收市六千四百四十六元、較之上日（五月）收價軋小六十九元、若减掉期、賣方貼出五十三元、則小十六元、照六月美金五元三四三七五結價、爲六千五百十七元、的撳七十一元、收市後升至六千四白六十元、上半日有一百十八元上落、下午塲外價再升至六千叫百七十元、金號本牌金門市售價比烚赤六月期交價高二百元、收進比售出低六七十元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>紗花　投機心神不定　紗市乍上乍落</h3>
<p>紗市又在飄盪不定中、且謠言紛紛、足使人心紊亂如蔴、此因投機的入們、心神不一所致、是以市盤乍高乍低、但實際交易、依然暗淡如恒、港幫除粗紗稍有需要外、其他絕無納胃、又有人說、外埠二十支紗價廉宜、販運商無利可圖、然一般大戶購進者安然勿動、據云原料不鬆、決無脫意、父說雙馬紗之廠單關閉不放、棧單異常乾涸、所以做多者復見踴躍、二十支隻馬高價一千四百八十六元、低價爲一千四百四十八元、午後初做一千四百七十元、漲至一千四百七十六允、中途回至一千四百七十二元，最後價爲一千四百七十六七元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市氣良好、有一部份因美棉上升、傾向拖進、首盤價爲一千四百五十五元、少頃微下至一千四百五十元、旋聞標金掉期空頭貼出、多頭方面、大都購進加碼、市盤乃徐徐上升至一千四百七十六元、中途盈利一吐略回、但塲內議綸一致看高、不過實需寥寥無幾、直升至一千四百八十六元、豈料價格一高、反動驟起、及謠言復來、標金一霎間跌一百元、塲中賣聲突振、證券幫一致實出、直瀉至一千四百四十八元、但逾十二時後父說種種消息不確、買者復見活躍、漲全一千四百六十九元收盤、查牛日間成交統計一萬五千七百八十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一五、〇〇〇　香港七八〇</p>
<p>統計一五、七八〇</p>
<h3>棉市脚地堅實</h3>
<p>現棉情况、稍形良好、因美棉暴漲、外滙略縮及紗個良好、致人心堅挺、持貨者咸不願脫手、細絨原料猶極堅硬、但廠方需要未見十分興旺也、昨共成交四百六十件、價漲五六元、</p>
<p>巴西花四〇九　慶盛二三五件棧交</p>
<p>米得林四一七　九豐一〇〇件又</p>
<p>又　四二一　吉豐一二五件又</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、依然因廠需呆滯而停留不進、但因海外水脚頻增、及美印棉一再高漲之影響、棉市脚地頗屬堅實也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因有華盛頓政治消息、國府順利進行、百分之八五棉麥貸款影響、及棉布貿易情形良好、各方人心煥發、大衆買進熱烈、市况更趨活躍堅昂、昨日收盤價格、較之上日竟漲高五十至七十磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市先因廠方買進而漲、繼之又因獲利了結抑平、最後再因投機買進、及國外市况堅挺而漲、結果收盤價格除白洛去四五月份獨漲十羅比外、其餘各漲一至四羅比左右、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况看高五·七五羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粵港南洋　布銷最盛</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市盤旋、人心恍惚、晨開步步上漲、近午有一度回風、午後又見回升、結果白貨細布斜紋每疋漲五角至一元、粗布漲二角半至五角、漂染布亦見扳俏、實銷粵港兩洋幫最暢、餘路需要平庸、乃因運輸路綫迄被統制之故、本街成交各布五百餘件、粵港幫辦斜紋·色布等四百餘件、國外暹邏等地辦漂布·漂斜·色布等五千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　先漲後跌、繼復上騰、結果細布漲五角、細斜漲一元許、龍頭細布現棧單後市收盤爲四十九元、四君子嗶嘰一元五角二分、市塲交易獨盛、顧十九皆屬投機心思、客路實銷仍呆滯如故、</p>
<h3>呢絨堅疲不一</h3>
<p>昨呢絨市氣、雖客幫交易有限、而本街交易甚盛、觀其各種貨價售盤、則堅疲不一、如秋銷之中厚深色花呢·嗶嘰海林棒·官維西裝呢·火姆四本海力司·冬銷之麥而等平厚呢·男女色大衣呢·長毛絨馬海絨·元直貢鞋毡呢等、大都堅昂居奇、若巴勒呢·胖別取·羽紗呢·白嗶嘰·白直貢·紗蔴膠布等、多轉平疲、派力司則賡續傾跌中、上月份售二十二元一碼之怡和派力可、昨已售至十八元七角五分矣、</p>

<h3>糖市　粗砂續降</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢、以人心向下、致繼續猛跌、公會劃盤二四粗白期貨本月二十日打單開盤一百十一元二角、至十一元·十元〇五角·三角·四角·一角·一百〇九元七角、收盤一百十元零四角、計降二元三角、月底打單者初爲一百十三元至十二元六角·一角·二角·十二元·十一元九角·六角·四角·十一元·十元〇七角·五角·計小三元三角、太古車白亦隨粗砂而下降、B嘜一百十二元、小二元、HX嘜九十八元五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　笋衣獻新</h3>
<p>首批生笋衣、已於昨日運到、共計六十件、當即開出、價為三百七十元、相常高昂、市勢甚俏、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤新貨將到</h3>
<p>—行情反加三十元—鴻基白煤、日來市上盛傳新貨即將大批批埠、但同業行盤、昨日又加高三十元、自車每噸由四百元漲至四百三十元、與暗盤相仿、當此淡銷時節、一加再加、殊令人莫解、故本街門莊、亦已抬高、塊煤每噸叫百六十元、篩塊四百七十六元、送到客戶、車力在內、</p>
<h3>雜項　火柴燭皂　—價都回小</h3>
<p>日用品市價連日步跌、同業內外囤戶急求脫手、新囤乏人、各物均呈平疲、昨市做開、如美麗牌火柴每箱價做七百元、鳳凰牌每箱六百九十一元、均降二十餘元、固本肥皂每箱五十六元五角、白祥茂皂每箱四十七元、黃祥茂皂每箱四十四元、均比前小二三元之多、船牌洋燭每箱二十七元、目下市氣難以向榮、</p>

<h3>基督的使徒</h3>
<p>— 蔣萍</p>
<p>是星期日的上午，美好的太陽促醒我很早就起身，正在寫字台上校閱一篇稿子的時候，忽聽得以手指彈門的聲音，我驚異地發現一個中等身材的西洋人，驀塊裏站在書室門口，他看見我發現了他，便毫不遲疑地走近了我的寫字台，使我不得不以洋涇浜的英語問他你來是幹什麼的，他很敏捷地將一張紅色的套在軟玻璃套裏的卡紙給我看，我纔發覺他是執行耶穌基督的使命，來推銷基督敎書籍的。他立刻又從這隻鉅型的破舊的皮夾裏，取出了兩册硬紙面洋裝相當厚的書，很恭敬地放在我的面前，叫我欣賞，並說這書內容是那麽好，讀了將使你得到許多的益處，意思耍我買他的書。</p>
<p>我發覺他的英語也不很悅耳。他的衣服正配合一位耶穌基督使徒的身份。中等身材，圓圓的臉兒，碧綠深陷的眼眶裏，深藏着一幅悲慘的陰影。我不待問他，已揣測到他的身世了。</p>
<p>這兩冊書都是盧德福J．F．Rutherford著的，由赫德路七三一號萬　聖經硏究會發行的，書名一册叫「豐富」Riches，一冊叫「仇敵」Enemies。他很快地翻出「仇敵」第十四頁指給我看——</p>
<p>「德國在世界大戰之後，：一個熱在的希特勒就被擁爲絕端的獨裁者和納粹黨的首領。…於是德國的民主政治就吿滅亡。…希特勒治下的納粹黨爲恐喪失權柄，繼續用殘酷手段行使統治權，將那在表　上凡不贊助他們的，都　以殺害或監禁。民衆忍受苦痛，因爲他們在物質上的財富遭了掠奪，他們的自由和生命受了威脅，並且處於極端的困苦和恐慌之中。」</p>
<p>這段文字，很像替他和同樣的遭遇者所寫，他指給我看這段文字，或者要我同情他。我問他是不是猶太人，他說是德國人；其實該是德籍猶太人吧。我覺得他似乎並不老實。</p>
<p>「我並不要這些書，因爲我不是基督徒。」我翻了數頁，就把這些書推還給他。</p>
<p>「這些書的內容，非常有價値，印刷得那麽精美，每册祇售一元，是那樣便宜；你檯上有那麼多的書，你也該買了這兩冊書，將會使你獲得更多的益處」。他看見我檯上疊着許多書，堅決誇獎他的書促使我買它。一方面他又拿出許多薄薄的小册子。</p>
<p>「因爲我不是基督徒，所以我並不想看道些書」。我的態度仍很堅決。</p>
<p>「你祇要少吸一包香烟，少拍一張照片，你可以買了這些書呀」！他見我在抽紙烟，同時將手指觸在玻璃板下的照片，含有責備的口氣對我說：「這些對於你是毫無益處呀」！</p>
<p>我有些微慍，但我仍忍耐着說：一照片供我欣賞，並留作紀念；香烟是足以增加我的工作效能；怎麽於我沒有益處？我不要買你的醫。你要吸烟嗎」？我遞給他一支烟，他沒有接受。</p>
<p>突然一個莫明的意識浮現我的腦海：我爲什麽不買他的書呢？不說上帝，就在人道立塲說，我何嘗不可同情他」？我的意志已經動搖。我發覺他立在旁邊已經有十餘分鐘，倒像有些虐待了他，便請他在寫字檯對面的椅子上坐下。他喜出望外，用中國人通常的禮貌很恭敬莊重地坐在我的對面，臉上浮起一個滿意的笑渦。</p>
<p>由於我的問長問短，他告訴我說是一年半前來上海的，沒有職業，替敎會推銷這些書，津貼他一些生活費。由於上帝賦予人類的同情心，由於耶基穌督所讚美的施捨互助精神，我終於貿了這兩冊書。他到了弄堂裏，就給研　捕驅逐了出去。我想他每天會遭到許多人驅逐的。</p>
<p>因爲納粹黨人掠奪了他們的財富，他們的自由和生命受了威脅，不得不流亡到自由都市的上海，於是這「樂圍」裏增加了這批亡命的「冒險家」</p>
<h3>「接觸鼻膜」驚人奇術　衛丹博士减低診金優待華人</h3>
<p>衛丹醫學博士，爲使華人病家享受其神術療治，特定優待診金，庶免向隅而使回春妙術遍澤人間也。但衛丹醫博士之「接觸鼻膜」新術並非百病皆除一，惟祇限於下列各種幸注意焉。</p>
<p>（一）氣喘此頑症也。患者常致灰心失望，但經施該術一次，其病若失。且有在施術完畢時，喘氣大減，其或完全消滅者。</p>
<p>至於常有噴嚏之枯草熱病，及痼性鼻感冒，鼻涕常流，以此術治之，亦有特效。</p>
<p>（二）神經系病　頭痛，昏迷，震顫，失眠等症，施術數次便可痊愈。凡患神經衰弱者，失其理智之控制，無故憂鬱，喜怒無常，經療治後，便覺神淸志爽，恢復常態。同時衛丹博士對於神經病者，亦能奏效醫治。患此者每每忽然失去良知，動作痙攣，從前均以爲不治之症，今則挽救有方。　自衛丹博士抵滬以來，療治此病甚衆。衛丹博士亦能診治半身不遂及柏金臣疾，按患此疾者肌肉堅硬，兩手震顫。</p>
<p>至於癱瘓之病，他醫束手，認爲療治無術，病者亦已絕望，幸得衛丹博士神術而痊可，且四肢活動如常者，大不乏人也。</p>
<p>（三）消化器病胃痛，嘔吐胃酸，便秘等症均治</p>
<p>（四）痛疼各種痛疼，允以風濕，胃痛，腰酸背痛，一經「接觸鼻膜」新術療治各痛消除。</p>
<p>（五）兒童發育遲緩兒童身心發育遲緩，所以行動蹣跚，言詞躊躇，皆爲心神不定所致。一更有神經過敏，得一接觸鼻膜」治理，立能恢復常態。</p>
<p>由此觀之，上述成績，祇須用金麗小捧接觸鼻膜，便能立奏奇效，人皆認為神術。但衛丹博士，不事炫奇，而以純粹科學爲立塲。蓋其深知管理吾人康健之樞紐，所謂一交應大神經」者，集於鼻黏液膜之間，一經衛丹博士之術接觸，立爲興奮。按其術實與中國數千年來所用針灸，在人身各穴刺激同一原理云。</p>
<p>衛丹博士爲愼重起見，必須檢騐病者，方斷定是吾施術，非十分有握療治奏效之病，不責貿然從事者，故初次檢騐並不收費，且病家願醫與吾，亦聽其便，足見衛丹博士之仁心仁術也矣。</p>
<p>問津者每日上午十時至十二時，下午四時至六時（星期六下午星期日停診）駕臨外灘華攀飯店七〇七號房間便可。</p>

<h3>赫斯的「妄想狂」</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>此决德國要人赫斯，出乎世人意料之外地，突然駕機出亡飛英；雖然祇是一個人的行動，可是因爲地位的關係，對於世界大局的前途，無疑地將有重大的影響。</p>
<p>事出之後，德方起初宣稱赫斯業已「自殺」，繼言赫斯患了「精神錯亂」，並有「妄想」之病徵。「自殺」究竟需　事實的證明，「精神錯亂」則比較容易含糊過去，所　說赫斯「精神錯亂」顯然是聰明得多了。</p>
<p>但是據精神病學的書上說，所謂「妄想」者種類繁多，就像非洲土人的迷信鬼神也可以算在「妄想」之列，但是這種「妄想」，並不能說是精神錯亂。</p>
<p>眞性的妄想在可分下列幾種：（一）被迫害的妄想，（二）猜疑的妄想，（三）憂鬱妄想在，（四）誇大妄想在，（五）性慾妄想在，（六）宗敎妄想狂，（七）人格妄想在。赫斯如果有所謂妄想狂的話，那麽該屬於第一第一種了。可是如果他的看法有事實做根據，就小能說是「妄想」。</p>
<p>至於說赫斯「妄想　英親善」，如果這眞的也是「妄想」的話，那麼應該與非洲土人的迷信並列，不能說是「精神錯亂」了。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>我是一個女工</h3>
<p>— 肅草</p>
<p>我是　個女工。在廠中工作，以大量的勞力博取低微的代價。生活的困難艱苦，是可以想像得到的。但是，誰知道在我們的生活中，還有更大的痛苦呢！</p>
<p>『那摩溫』擁有一種潛勞力：『先生』們——工人對於職員都稱作『先生』——對於她，幾乎是言聽計從；而我們工人對她，也祇能唯命是聽。我們爲博她的歡心，不得不趨奉她，吾則，她會在『先生』前設你的壞話，使『先生』罰你，開除你。所以，在每月的收入中，不得不多方撙卽，抽出一部份血汗來，作爲聯絡她的『交際費』。</p>
<p>『先生』中好的固然很多，壞蛋卻也不少。他們對於年靑而長得比絞漂亮的女工，常存有可鄙的『企圖』：一有機會，便來兜搭。無理的戲謔，已是司空見慣，有時竟會邀你上館子。看　影·遊公園……，要是你嚴峻的拒絕，那麽地們就假職務上的便利，作無恥的報復：或是吹毛求疵地來罰你的工資；或是少加你工資；或是借題發揮，在大庭廣衆中斥駡你，使你置身無地；甚至會挾嫌誣害。會……。</p>
<p>有一位先生，對於年靑孀居的我，確是非常憐卹。無論精神物質，都給予我小少的幫助：他知道我一月的收入要維持三口的家庭——我還有一位婆婆和個孩子——非常困難，所以每次　工資，我總加得多一些；每逢　巾有額外工作，也總把我挨去，使我可以多得一些錢。他這樣的省待我，眞使我說不出的感激。那知道位外貌仁厚的先生，竟包藏一顆蛇蜴的心。逐漸地狐狸露出尾巴米了。原來他對我竟也有卑鄙的企圖。當我表示拒絕以後，他開始覺得失望，接着無恥的並復重重地加到我的身上來了。我沒有別的方法抵抗，祇有加緊對於自身工作的努力。但是，這抵抗力太薄弱了。罰工記過的懲罰，接連不斷地逼迫我，要我屈服。所幸，我的工作成績，細算在上等，廠中的其他許多先生，還知道我的成績，所以他還不能借了芝麻大的事端來開除我，使我沒有飯吃。但是，近一年來，眼見許多新工，工資一次一次的增加，一個個都高出於我了</p>
<p>以極大的勞力，換取極低的代價，還不能平穩地生活下去，這是什麽道理？我想：也許這是我的『命』吧？</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>睡眠可以取消嗎？</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>每個人在一生中最可惜的，便是睡眠至少佔去三分之一。世上不睡的人，可以說絕對沒有，至多有多睡與少陲之別而己！歷來醫學家往往相信睡眠是人類所必需，因爲可以恢復疲倦的身心與腦力。但是這種看法是吾絕對無誤呢？若進一步探求睡眠的目的果眞安在，那倒也未嘗不是有趣的事。</p>
<p>美國喬治華盛頓大學心理部主任摩士敎授（Prof．Fred　A．Mass）曾命男女學生各四人繼續六十小時不眠，視察結果，認爲睡眠爲一種習慣，其狀態與醉酒相似。當實騐結束時，各學生精神雖覺非常困倦，但於健康毫無妨礙，摩士敎授更欲覘定失眠者對於工作的效率如何，乃命各人在五十小時不眠之後，命各人駕駛汽車，結果工作並未失去效能。摩士敎授自己每夜僅睡六小時，辦事精神絲毫不减。</p>
<p>在硏究睡眠秘密的科學家中，哥倫比亞大學心理學敎授霍林烏斯Dr．H．L．Holliwonrth）也曾發出過驚人言論，謂將來人類　達，有成爲一「不陲人種」之可能。渠主張使睡眠時問逐漸减少，久而久之，可以完全不睡。例如每二月依次减睡五分鐘，若現在睡八小時，十六年之後，已可完全不睡。霍敎授認睡眠是一種悲劇，可以當其他疾病同樣看待之。霍敎授謂睡眠實由祖先遺傳而來，因上古之世。人類知識幼稚，在日落黃昏後，黑幕繼至，欲繼續活動，殊不可能，旣然無所事事，自然昏昏臥下，以復天光復明，後來成爲習慣，傳與其子孫後代，變成不可缺少的了！</p>
<p>此外，科學家認睡眠爲人類習慣者甚多，如芝加哥大學克萊文（Dr．Craven）博士等之實騐，亦證明睡眠可以完全廢除，至少也可减至某最低限度，克博士曾歷五日四夜小睡，足足一百十五小時，結果知道如常令筋肉收縮，便可驅除睡覺。又如著名　學　哈理士博士（Dr．Frazer　Harris）及克理兒博士（Dr．AW．Crile）哥頓敎授（Prof．Arthur　Cotton）等都曾致力於硏究替代睡眠之法。哥敎授相信睡眠由於腦細胞內電氣化學作用之反動，若能發明一電氣機械，直接使疲倦之腦細胞恢復活動力，那麽睡眠可以不需耍了！</p>
<p>總之，不論睡眠是吾習慣之一，也不論睡眠是吾眞正需要，一個人生被其佔去三分之一，實在非常可惜。古今大人物往往睡眠很少，愛迪生的少眠，是大衆週知的事；此外如大英雄拿破崙，德國雄主弗萊特力克大帝（Freorick　the　Great）以及德國詩人西勒爾，意大利文舉家泰士那等，每日睡眠三小時至五小時，已覺滿意，可見他們有如此成就，決不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>人生至多百年，而被睡眠佔去寳貴的三分之一時間，這該是如何令人可悲的事！何怪科學家要努力找一替代睡眠之法了！</p>
<p>但更有可偕的，有些，旣已消耗三分之一的時間於睡眠，對於其他三分之二的時間，也任其在昏昏沉沉中溜過，這些人的一生時間，實在都是浪費了的！因此，在未有替代睡眠法之前，爲節的時間，也爲搶救生命，應立即在淸醒的時候從速加緊工作！</p>

<p>丹麥因受歐洲戰事之影饗，汽油奇缺，私人汽車已無法開駛，一般殷富商人，乃異想天開，利用雙人脚踏車，僱用脚踏車夫，以代汽車，作爲出入代步之用。丹麥京城之脚踏車原有一百七十五萬架，現已突增至三百八十萬　云。亦歐戰聲中之趣話也。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「但是我往後怎麽還能做人呢？」不等他說完，秋海棠便這樣呻吟着說。</p>
<p>紹文立刻在他床沿上坐了下去。</p>
<p>「老兄弟，往後的事一定都在我身上！」他緊泰地攀住了秋海棠的眉頭說：「反正你本來就不大願意唱戲，往後不要再唱就是啦！至於季兆雄那那個狗才呢？你瞧着：我無論如何決不會放過他！至少限度，我不能議他活得比你還快樂！」</p>
<p>他說到最後那兩句話的時候，豐音裏有一種很淸楚的表示，使秋海棠聽了，知道他是不久一定會實踐的。</p>
<p>秋海棠本來就不是一個蠻不講理的人，而紹文所給予他的解釋，又是那樣的詳盡而親切，他當然不能再使多年的好朋友爲難了。</p>
<p>第二天下午，紹文冉到醫院去看他的時候，在廊下便碰見那個主持外科的醫生。</p>
<p>「你令弟的創口大概倒可以不冉潰爛了。」</p>
<p>醫生說：「只是他老睡不熟，好像心事重得很；我們要是常給他吃安眠榮也不大好，這個對於創口和身體部有很大的影響的。最好你去給他解勸解勸！」</p>
<p>可是這一，點却不是紹文所能解勸的了，而且他所料到的也只秋海棠的心事的一半：在他想米，秋海棠無非總是爲着怗記羅湘綺的緣故，其實他不知道他還有一重更大的心事咧—那就是他那病了的女兒。（一〇六）</p>

<h3>越劇由來的一頁血淚史</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>嘗讀明祝枝山所著猥談有云：「崑曲之支派，自宋元院本傳至於明，分有曼綽，弦索調二種，古音漸失。其流傳於北地者，爲弋陽腔，高陽腔，等調，雜有朔燕之音。其流傳入於漢者，稱爲樅陽腔，流傳入於湖廣者，稱爲襄陽腔。」枝山明人，所述自是當時實况，則今之談戲劇流傳者，蓋無論平劇，粵劇，以及各地之地方劇，謂爲脫胎於宋元之崑曲，胥無不可，至於何者爲先，何者爲後，則戲劇　道，公私記載，略焉不群，未可妄爲臆測也。</p>
<p>日前本刋載谷梅先生平劇與紹與戲一文，述紹興戲脫胎於南宋苟安後之南戲，其意似與上述相脗合，筆者向嘗聞之於吾邑已故老曲家錢君云。。「越劇產生於明末，爾時舁平日久，宗室之派駐各郡者，養尊處優，豐衣足食，了無所事，日維以絲竹管絃，聲色犬馬爲消閒之具。及明社旣屋，昔之所謂金枝玉葉而逍遙自在者，都一變而爲階下囚，駐趣郡者，獨以平時醉心戲劇，精音樂，解歌唱，無壯志而得赦免，不過命男子永爲鼓吹手，女子永爲喜娘，是卽所購『墮民』者！此聚旣禁與他姓爲婚，復不得讀書預歲試，仕宦之　旣絕，遂不得不於平日嗜之成癖之歌劇中求生活矣。至是越劇乃大昌，今之紹興戲，實其進型也。初，宗室駐越地者，子息甚繫，分炊異居，行之有年，當明淸易代之際，懼遭滅族，多變姓氏以圖苟活，及赦書下，仍多不敢公然言眞姓氏，是以『墮民』姓氏甚雜，時日旣久，即其子孫亦鮮有知者矣。」是則越劇發展過程中，固包含一頁民族血淚史也。記之亦所以悼古傷今而已！</p>

<p>美瞬的影片，自從受歐戰影響後，市塲縮小，乃紛紛向南美洲發展。南美洲人最喜歡看埃洛爾茀林和詹姆士賈克奈主演的片子，而女明星中最愛蓓蒂黛維絲，她近被南美洲某電影刊物選舉爲影后呢。</p>

<p>他們的喜期，是在去年七月四日，她婚後是否繼續托片的問題，和狄愛娜寳萍和馮保羅結婚的消息，同　被影迷所殷切地關懷着的，宋雅海妮本人，對於這個問題的答覆是：「外面很有不少人，以爲我同譚托平結婚後，那將退出影壇，其實這是不確的，也許我將來會有這個意思，但至少在最近期間，我是不會離開影界和溜冰事業的。目前我的事業工作得很順利，假使一旦我的工作會有不愜意，那末我不滯留在電影界里了。」這里她所說的不愜意，當然就是她的叫座能力了。</p>
<p>現在她已有個安定而美滿的家庭生活、當然不再須要再顯色相了。所以據我們看來，宋雅海妮重進影壞，恐怕是不可能的了。</p>

<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第九章　憐君何事到天涯</p>
<p>說罷，遂佩上赤鳳貿劍　了行李，悄然走出王家大門，跨上大道，一步步走出城關去。他心裏本無一定的去處，祇顧向冷僻的地方走，漸漸離了熱鬧之區而至山野。這時已近炎夏，驕陽如火，走得他滿頭汗出。見道旁有兩株人楡樹，濃蔭匝地，正好一個歇凉所在，他就在楡樹下，放下句裹，席地而坐。果然有兩陣凉風吹來，精神一爽。他低着頭目思我此次離鄉背井，到得這裹無非想乘亂世，立些功名。王永泰是父執，又是前輩英雄得他在周將軍面前提携正乃良好的　會，誰知平空生出了這種意想不到的岔子？那妖姬淫毒萬分，對我誘惑不成，立刻想出　毒的陰謀，在王永泰面前搬弄是非，把我攆走，從此伊和姓桑的史是肆無忌憚，不怕他人云揭穿他們的秘密了。我不該說王永泰怎樣如此老悖，聽信婦人之言，竟下逐客之令，所以古人說惟女子與小人爲難養也了。浸潤之語，膚　之愬，對於父母估且要變心，何况對於故人之子呢？自然史容易聽信伊的巧言如簧了。但我　靖是個頂火立地的好男兒，受此不白之寃，豈是一走了事？無淪如何，我必使王永泰澈底明瞭眞相，自悔小是，也爲他除去他日的隱慶。况且我蒙周遇吉將車垂變錄用，倘然棄之他走，又到那裏去會逢到這樣的好將軍呢？所以我是不能離　代州的。那麽我　了城關又往何處去書覓鷓鴣　枝之寄呢？住客寓吧？阮囊羞澀，不能有數日之糧。往周遇吉將軍衙中去吧？爲了王永泰的關係，我也軧有暫時不去見他的面，以免和王水泰難堪。最好有個禪院古利，暫時樓身　下爲宜，那麽還是到山中去尋找吧。於是他坐了一回，站起身米，携了包裹，向山中去。山徑紆迴曲折，風景甚是幽。許靖一心想找禪院，但是山中居民很少，時我不到。剛纔走過一個嶺，路旁松林裹忽然竄出一頭兇惡的狼米。許靖知道這畜牛是要噬人的，連忙放下包裹，拔出赤鳳寳劍凖備自衛。那狼見有了生人，果然惡狠狠地向許靖身十撲去。許靖喝聲「孽畜膽敢傷人」揮動寳劍，向狼進刺。一人一狼止在嶺下狠鬭，忽然平空飛來一隻嚮鏢，噹啷喞一聲正中狼的頸項。那狼在嗥一聲，立即仆倒在草際。許靖俯首細瞧時，那枝嚮鏢已穿過狼的咽喉，射成一個窟窿，流得滿地鮮血，那狼　倒　了。（六三）</p>

<h3>The European War Will Expand to the Near East: Germany Announces the Red Sea as a War Zone; US Government Declares No Change to Previous Announcement; German-Italian Allied Forces Launch New Offensive on Egyptian Border</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German government last night announced the Red Sea as a war zone, warning all ships not to sail through it again, at the risk of being bombed. The Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba in the northern Red Sea are both war zones, prohibiting the passage of all ships, except for Saudi Arabian territorial waters. Pilgrimage ships (i.e., ships carrying Muslims to holy sites) may pass through, but will be subject to special inspections, according to a 14th-day Reuters dispatch. Note that US President Roosevelt recently declared the Red Sea a non-war zone, allowing US ships to sail there (Havas).</p>
<p>Berlin: German sources recently stated that the official announcement of expanding the war zone to the Red Sea is related to intensifying the war in the Mediterranean. However, neutral diplomats believe that Germany's intention is to directly target the United States (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).</p>
<p>Washington: Well-informed sources recently stated that Germany's declaration of the Red Sea as a war zone will not change President Roosevelt's recent announcement allowing US ships to sail in the Red Sea. President Roosevelt believes that it should only be declared a war zone when war has actually broken out in the area. Unless the Germans can control the Red Sea, the area is not considered to be in immediate danger (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).</p>
<p>New York: The Beirut Radio Station reports that a large number of British troops, totaling two divisions, have landed at the port of Haifa in Palestine. There are also hundreds of tanks and a large number of vehicles. These troops are the same ones who previously fought in Greece. Furthermore, travelers from West Africa report that a large British army is concentrated in Freetown (a key port 500 miles south of Dakar). Passengers passing through the port personally witnessed seven troop transport ships and seventy to eighty merchant ships inside the port (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent with a British mobile patrol in the Western Desert cabled that enemy forces attacked on Sunday, seemingly deploying 200 tanks, operating independently and without communication to a supply line. They assume that when it is necessary to establish a supply line in the depths of Egypt, it will not be difficult to establish one. The enemy army advanced towards Egypt in five routes at dawn. They clashed with British forces between Sollum on the coast and Bir Khamsa, fifty miles into the desert to the south. The first route of German troops advanced along the coastal highway towards Bardia, but was blocked by the offensive positions of the British vanguard. Another route descended a slope and turned south, encountering the British vanguard on the coastal plain. The third and fourth routes crossed the Egyptian border west of Sollum. The fifth route attempted to flank the British forces and attack from the south. Dust swirled at the top of the slope, and the two armies were unaware of each other's movements within a few miles, making the battle highly mobile (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>Berlin: German and Italian troops advancing from Sollum along the Egyptian border pushed forward seventy kilometers. The enemy retreated before the fierce attack by the German-Italian forces (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>US Nationals in the Near East Prepare to Withdraw; Residents Evacuated from Alexandria</h3>
<p>Ankara: US nationals in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt have received notices from their respective consulates to proceed to the Suez Canal, where four American ships are available to evacuate them. This indicates that US nationals in the Near East will soon be completely evacuated (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>Rome: "Il Popolo d'Italia" reported today that civilians in Alexandria have begun to evacuate, with thousands of women and children being sent to safe areas upstream of the Nile (13th-day Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>Iraq Willing to Accept Turkish Mediation; Presents Ceasefire Conditions; Two Major Points Violate Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; Ankara Feels Success is Unlikely</h3>
<p>Water Surrounds Suburbs of Baghdad, Impeding British Advance</p>
<p>Ankara: According to reliable sources, Iraqi government leader Ali Gailani has instructed his Minister of Defense to bring the following conditions for Turkish mediation: (1) British troops landing in Basra must not remain there, but must be transferred to destinations outside of Iraq. (2) Although Ali Gailani agrees to increase the number of British troops stationed in Iraq, he insists that the increased number and how to implement the troop increase must be decided and resolved by a joint Anglo-Iraqi committee. Since these two points contradict the terms of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, Ankara feels that the Iraqi Minister of Defense's visit to Turkey has little chance of success. The Iraqi Embassy in Ankara has refused to comment, except to say that the mission of the Iraqi Minister of Defense has ended. However, the minister is still lingering here for a few days, and it is rumored that he will meet with German Ambassador von Papen to Turkey. Ali Gailani's attempt to declare a holy war against the British has been ridiculed and also violates the will of his own people, since Iraq gained independence with British assistance (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>Cairo: The Iraqi government of Ali Gailani has replied to the Egyptian government, stating that it has received its proposal for mediation and expresses its gratitude. However, the Iraqi government has already accepted Turkish mediation and is now handling the Turkish proposal (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>Beirut: It is reported that yesterday, the suburbs of Baghdad were flooded by order of the Iraqi Commander-in-Chief to impede the British advance (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Signs of Strengthened German-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>Istanbul: Non-Turkish sources recently pointed out that the return of German Ambassador von Papen to Ankara apparently coincided with the Soviet Union's recognition of the anti-British Iraqi regime, with the intention of getting Turkey to cooperate with the Axis powers. They also stated that Turkey's best response would be for the Turkish Parliament to approve the allocation of 13,500,000 Turkish pounds for national defense. It is believed here that the Soviet Union's recognition of Iraqi anti-British Prime Minister Gailani is sufficient to indicate that Stalin, who is in charge of the Soviet government, has decided to launch a policy of strengthened Soviet-German cooperation. At the same time, unconfirmed reports from Ankara Radio state that two German bombers have arrived at the Mosul oil fields in Iraq (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).</p>
<h3>German Ambassador von Papen Returns to Post; Meets with Turkish Foreign Minister; Rumored to Carry Letter from Hitler; Reassures Turkey of No Aggressive Intentions</h3>
<p>Ankara: After returning to Ankara, German Ambassador von Papen held a long meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu yesterday. Political circles here believe that this conversation is of great importance (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>Turkish Capital: The Turkish Nationalist Party held a meeting here today, where Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu reported on the recent situation. Prime Minister Saydam delivered a speech, which was unanimously endorsed by all representatives. It is generally believed here that German Ambassador von Papen's return this time was accompanied by a letter from Führer Hitler, again assuring Turkey that the Axis powers' occupation of the Greek islands near the Dodecanese is only a "symbolic occupation." The troops stationed on the islands have no aggressive power, and the German mechanized forces have already withdrawn from the Balkan Peninsula, with their complete withdrawal being only a matter of time. Germany's demands on Turkey are limited to enhancing bilateral trade relations. Although the situation in Turkey has eased, it is generally expected that the Turkish government will not relax its vigilance in recent months (13th-day Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>Former Iraqi Prime Minister Dies Suddenly in Syria</h3>
<p>Milan: Former Iraqi Prime Minister Hashimi recently died suddenly in Damascus. Hashimi fled Baghdad during the Iraqi coup. He was highly trusted by the British government. Hashimi became Prime Minister in January of this year, which the British government strongly supported (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Baghdad Islamic Leader Issues Call for Muslims to Revolt Against the British</h3>
<p>New York: The Beirut (Syria) Radio Station broadcast that the Islamic leader of Baghdad issued a call for all Muslims to revolt against the British, "The time for our independence from the British has come!" It is claimed that a rebellion has broken out in the triangle area of Palestine. English families are fleeing south to South Africa, as are wealthy Jews (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).</p>
<h3>Moscow to Hold Air Defense Drill; 150,000 People to Participate</h3>
<p>Moscow: A statement here said that a large-scale air defense drill will be held near Moscow tomorrow. No less than 150,000 firefighters will participate, and some police will also join the drill. At that time, there will be a blackout, plunging the entire city into darkness, while "self-defense forces" will search for simulated enemy paratroopers (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>British and American Ambassadors Visit Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned to Tokyo from Europe on the 22nd of last month, US Ambassador Grew this morning at 10:20 and British Ambassador Craigie this morning at 11:30 visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time. It is believed that they inquired about Japan's attitude towards adjusting relations with Britain and the United States and discussed other issues (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Australia and the Dutch East Indies Have Close Ties</h3>
<p>Batavia: According to news from Sydney, Australia is paying close attention to the visit of Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter. Kleffens stated that he now recognizes that Australia and the Dutch East Indies have close ties, and hopes that this trip will enhance relations between the neighboring countries. The two ministers had a long meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Stewart (10th-day Reuters dispatch). Scene of the Suez Canal</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Flight of German Deputy Führer Hess</h3>
<p>The merits and demerits of democratic and dictatorial political systems is an old and much-debated question. Opinions vary, and there is no consensus. Even from the experience of this European war, Germany's internal unity and flexible operation stand in stark contrast to France's litigiousness and slow response. The democratic systems of the United Kingdom and the United States have also proven their resilience under severe testing. An event like the flight of German Deputy Führer Hess to the United Kingdom is unthinkable in a democratic country, and this is a major weakness of dictatorial political systems.</p>
<p>The real reasons and motives for Hess's flight are still unclear, but judging from the National News Agency's announcement, there is no doubt that there are major differences of opinion between him and the current German authorities. The so-called mental disorder and serious illness are clearly deceptive excuses. Until the day of his flight, Hess was always the Deputy Party Leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler's representative, and second in line to succeed him. In terms of political responsibility, his position was certainly not as prominent as that of Goering or Ribbentrop, but in terms of party organization, no one other than Hitler could compare with him. Germany is in a critical period of war, and such an important position would not be entrusted to a mentally unsound patient for long! Given Hess's power and high status, his personal opinions could not be fully expressed within the party, which led him to flee on his own. This is even more evident for those whose status is not as high as Hess's, and for the general population. It is believed that there are many people in Germany who share the same feelings as Hess, but they do not even have the opportunity to flee abroad. In the past, people often underestimated the organizational capacity of the Nazi Party, as if it would soon collapse due to internal contradictions. After the victory on the Western Front last summer, they overestimated it, and no one placed any hope in the internal affairs of the Nazis. In fact, Hitler's rule is not like a heap of loose sand, nor is it perfect. The authorities strictly control and oppress the people, and the people are afraid of the humiliation and pain of the defeat in the last war, so they maintain integrity and unity on the surface. It is not that the vast majority of Germans who opposed the Nazis until the 1932 elections have now become Hitler's loyal supporters, nor is it that every German now embraces the policy of aggressive militarism. However, the dark side of Germany has begun to be exposed by Hess's flight.</p>
<p>The European war is continuing, and the more the Axis powers gain the upper hand, the more enemies they make, and the wider the war becomes. Therefore, no one dares to predict when and where the war will end. This is certainly a misfortune for the world, but Germany, at the heart of the war, suffers the most. Hitler won a majority of votes in 1933 because he promised the Germans to break free from the shackles of Versailles, so his rearmament of the Rhineland and the recovery of the Saarland were powerful weapons to consolidate his regime. When he annexed Austria and seized Czechoslovakia, he had already gone beyond the scope of seeking to restore national pride, and the people only got the forced exchange of butter for cannons, which even led to the outbreak of a great war that swept across the entire European continent, and openly touted the "New Order" to transform Europe and even the world as the ultimate goal. These things, even if they can stimulate or excite the internal population for a while, are increasingly distant from the original intention of seeking to restore national pride and survival. Even Hitler himself, his recent speeches have been repetitive and lack novelty to appeal to the masses. Moreover, the last great war is not far away, and even with the current victories, recalling the past pain cannot help but cause some painful memories, thereby reducing the longing for the victory touted by Hitler. This recent split may seem on the surface to be a dispute between war and opposition to war, but its essence is the inevitable reaction of those who dream of conquering the world within themselves. This is the inevitable fate of the aggressor, and on the other hand, it is what makes Hess different from Quisling.</p>
<p>However, even if this kind of split exists in Germany, it is not yet mature. Hess's solo flight is proof of this: If this attempt to oppose Hitler had a real chance of success, it would not be Hess who fled abroad, but other figures in the Nazi authorities. Hitler was able to use brutal massacres to suppress the rebellion of the radical faction led by Rohm in 1934, so he will probably use extraordinary means to mend the internal rift this time, although the nature of this rift should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>May 10 last year was the glorious day when the Nazi army began its offensive on the Western Front. This year, this day saw the tragicomedy of the Deputy Führer fleeing to the enemy country. This contrast clearly suggests the trend of the aggressor's rise and decline. If Hitler cannot come up with a decisive plan to break the stalemate and defeat the British in the near future, then the mistakes of 1918 may not be repeated. Recent events suggest that this kind of brewing exists within Germany.</p>
<h3>100,000 Chinese Troops Cross the Yellow River; Enter the Western Shanxi Triangle Area; Chinese Troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains Attack in the Rain and Achieve Expected Results; Chinese Positions Northwest of Yuanqu and Southeast of Xiaxian Remain Firmly Unmoved</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to local reports, the Chinese army is dealing with the war in the Shanxi-Henan border area with a large force. 100,000 Chinese troops flew across the Yellow River at the end of last week and entered the Western Shanxi Triangle Area. They are now fighting fiercely with the Japanese army (13th-day dispatch).</p>
<p>Chongqing: Fierce fighting is still taking place in the foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains in Southern Shanxi. Chinese troops are attacking in the rain and have achieved expected results. The Japanese army's attempt to clear out the Chinese troops has led them to venture deep into the mountainous area, where they have been surrounded by the Chinese army. The Chinese troops are still fighting fiercely on the mountain tops northwest of Yuanqu and southeast of Xiaxian (13th-day dispatch).</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The Japanese intelligence office here announced that the Japanese army began its offensive against the Chinese army in Huizhou from Boluo on May 10, and occupied the city at 4:00 pm on the 12th. Other teams fighting in the Dongjiang River occupied Huiyang, 120 kilometers east of Guangzhou. This is an important supply base for Chongqing. Another team advanced from Wanhua Gang (transliteration) to Pingshan Zui (transliteration), pursuing the retreating Chinese army. The Japanese troops who landed in Xianghai Bay are now developing an encirclement movement. Japanese planes have bombed Chinese military positions and ammunition depots in many places (14th-day Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Johnson Leaves Chongqing for Hong Kong Yesterday; He Yaozu Represents Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to See Him Off; Wei Daoming Flies to Hong Kong on the Same Plane to Prepare for His New Post</h3>
<p>Chongqing: US Ambassador Johnson, who has served in China for 33 and a half years, flew to Hong Kong this morning at 11:00, and will then proceed to Washington, and on to Canberra, where he will replace Gauss as the US Minister to Australia. Gauss will then come here, succeeding Johnson's position. Ambassador Johnson told a Reuters reporter, "I really feel reluctant at parting. It is rare for a person to live in a country for so long without forming inextricable ties." When talking about Sino-US relations, Johnson said, "The United States and China have gradually realized their mutual responsibilities in the Pacific. I am very pleased that this mutual understanding is even more important than the friendship that we have long enjoyed. It is like me and you, living in the same street, and each person in his own home can understand that if we keep our gardens and the open spaces in between clean and tidy, then we can not only live in peace with each other, but also improve the community in which we live. I am very pleased with this new awakening in China. The relationship between China and the United States is not only based on traditional friendship and the hope of assistance, but is based on the fact that Chinese leaders have gradually realized China's responsibility in the international community, and not just for the interests of China." Those who came to see off Ambassador Johnson included He Yaozu, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Transportation; Huang Renlin, Director-General of the New Life Movement; British Ambassador Kerr; Belgian Minister De Radzitzky; Duan Maolan, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and many other officials, as well as many leaders of cultural organizations.

<h3>Rice Prices Soar in the Hefei Area</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Southern Anhui: According to people from north of the Yangtze River, the Japanese army is constantly collecting food in the guerrilla areas, causing rice prices in the Hefei area, which is known for its rice production, to rise to more than 100 yuan per stone. Moreover, it seems that there is no market even at that price. Many people live on vegetables and tree bark, and are extremely hungry and poor (13th-day dispatch).</p>
<h3>China Plans to Conclude Treaty of Friendship with Thailand</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Affairs between China and Thailand are extremely simple. Although there are thousands of overseas Chinese in Thailand, they have no diplomatic protection. Although there is a friendly understanding between Thailand and China, there is no diplomatic treaty, which is clear proof of this. A large number of overseas Chinese go to Thailand every year, and most of those who reside in Thailand have been there for a long time, and some were even born in Thailand. Chinese people who grow up in Thailand can be mixed with local people and are like the Thai people. In recent months, the Chongqing government has been trying to persuade the Thai authorities to sign a treaty with China so that relations between the two countries have a solid foundation. However, Bangkok has rejected the proposal, on the grounds that many years of peace and harmony do not require the mutual appointment of ambassadors. Although the number of Thai people living in China is very small, Chongqing sees the current situation of the majority of overseas Chinese in Thailand as unsatisfactory, as they are often subjected to various restrictions. For example, Chinese newspapers are inspected because they are said to hold anti-Japanese views, and many Chinese schools have had to close down due to curriculum standards. Many overseas Chinese have been forced to return to their country due to restrictions, and they have appealed to Chongqing. Thailand's refusal to sign a treaty with China is because it can do whatever it wants with overseas Chinese. Moreover, many Chinese people live in Thailand no differently from the Thai people, and it is difficult to adjust their nationality. However, the Chongqing government is still trying to conclude a treaty of friendship with Thailand so that overseas Chinese in Thailand can live and work in peace (14th-day International News Service dispatch).</p>
<h3>House Coinage Committee Passes Dollar Devaluation Bill</h3>
<p>Washington. The House Coinage Committee yesterday passed, by a vote of nine to seven, a resolution to continue authorizing President Roosevelt to devalue the U.S. dollar for a period of two years. However, the bill includes an amendment stipulating that the price of foreign gold shall not exceed thirty-five U.S. dollars per ounce. Representative Andresen, a Republican from Minnesota, stated when introducing the amendment that, according to current law, the price of foreign gold could be raised to forty-one U.S. dollars per ounce. He also stated that domestic gold production is insignificant compared to world gold production. Therefore, setting the price of world gold at thirty-five U.S. dollars per ounce would ensure that any increase in domestic gold prices would not affect the value of the U.S. dollar.

<h3>Guardians for British Children in the U.S. and Canada</h3>
<p>To be assigned to Halifax, etc.</p>
<p>London. A bill read for the first time in the House of Lords yesterday stipulated that the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, will be appointed as the guardian of 838 British children in the U.S., and the High Commissioner to Canada, MacDonald, will be appointed as the guardian of 1,540 British children in Canada. These British children were sent to Canada and the U.S. under the care of the Overseas Reception Committee. The appointment of guardians has already been implemented in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, because in the current emergency, British children require the permission of their parents or guardians before undergoing medical treatment.

<h3>Hess Claims Defection Aims to Save Humanity; Remarks in Britain Expose German Weakness; Opposed German-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>London. British sources stated yesterday that the German Deputy Führer and Nazi third-in-command, Hess, defected to Britain with the illusion of "saving humanity from the tragedy of a complete German-Soviet partnership." Hess's moving ideals were revealed after the Messerschmitt aircraft he was piloting was riddled with bullets by Spitfire fighters over Scotland. Hess's first words after being identified were "I came here to save humanity." Doctors stated that Hess was completely lucid. He was not carrying any peace proposals or letters from Führer Hitler or Nazi leaders. Reliable sources stated that Hess left behind a wife and children in Germany because "the interior of Germany has become corrupt." Another near coincidence is that the owner of the property where Hess landed, the Duke of Hamilton, was once a member of the Anglo-German Fellowship. It is believed that the Duke met Hess during a flight over Mount Everest in 1933. It is rumored that the Duke is currently serving in the Royal Air Force. A responsible official here even stated that "Hess was inspired by religious fervor." (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Scotland. British officials have not yet announced the details of Hess's talks with British government leaders, but it is believed that Hess has spoken freely about Germany's war secrets. It is rumored that at least one member of the U.S. Cabinet has already met with Hess, and it is also rumored that Churchill will meet with him soon. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London. British commentators stated today that Hess, the third-ranking German official who fled to Britain on Saturday night, divulged to the former First Secretary of the British Embassy in Germany, Kirkpatrick, what the Ministry of Information called the first detailed account of the Nazi Party's split since Hitler's 1934 purge of his comrades. British sources believe that at least part of this information will be included in a statement that Churchill has authorized to be released in the near future. The extent of the Nazi Party's split is not yet clear, but Dr. Murfel, who translated "Mein Kampf" and has had close ties with Nazi leaders for ten years, wrote in the "Daily Sketch" that Hess had the support of senior German commanders and was on close terms with Himmler, the head of the political police. The "Daily Telegraph" commented, "Hess's defection certainly exposes the divisions within Germany. The unity of totalitarian states is fracturing from the top down." The "Daily News" political correspondent, Webb, declared, "Hess's defection to Britain can be said to prove the violent conflict among German leaders over war policy." Meanwhile, "The Times" commented that it would be a misunderstanding to believe that Hess's defection would hasten the destruction of the unity of Germany's war machine, and that Germany's military effectiveness would not necessarily decline. In the future, when the history of this war is written, this incident will be recognized as a harbinger of the breakdown of unity and the erosion of confidence. The reasons for Hess's break with other Nazi leaders have also given rise to much speculation. Many commentators believe that Hess was displeased with the intrigues and shamelessness of Hitler's entourage, and was horrified by the massacres he had witnessed, and therefore broke decisively due to the possibility of renewed relations with the Soviet Union. Hess's decision to flee to Britain was because he believed he could accomplish some purpose. What that purpose is is unknown, whether it is to serve as a warning, to mediate peace, or to believe that only the defeat of Germany can enable humanity to progress, and that he can make Germany fail. Priestley, who previously had close ties with senior German officials, wrote in the "Daily Mail" that Hess's flight to Britain was driven by religious fervor. He wrote, "Perhaps Hess's religious faith gradually became apparent, and he discovered the fundamental evil of Nazi ambitions. Such rapid transformations are not uncommon in history." (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Hess Moved to Secret Location</p>
<p>London. Today's newspapers all reported that Hess has now been transferred from Glasgow to a hospital in a secret location. The only other explanation is that it is close to London. However, it is not yet known whether Hess is prepared to narrate his departure from the Nazi Party. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London. Hess woke up in the hospital this morning in improved condition. His injured ankle is gradually healing, and the minor wound to his arm sustained when he jumped with a parachute is also healing rapidly. It is reported that he is in good spirits. Hess is wearing army pajamas and is supplied with military equipment such as a toothbrush and other items. A British army officer is guarding him while he takes his medicine. Hess spends most of his time resting and reading. The British have provided him with fiction and writing materials. Hess is writing a lot. He is eating ordinary hospital food such as chicken porridge and rice.</p>
<p>Recounts His Daring Flight to Britain</p>
<p>Hess piloted a Messerschmitt 110 fighter, which he had never flown before, alone for 900 miles, arriving at night, and made the first parachute jump of his life. His fatigue is understandable. Hess was detained by two members of the British Home Guard, Peterson and Gibson, after landing on a farm in Mackinnon. Hess told them, "There are no bombs on board, so don't worry." Hess carried a map with the route from Augsburg, Germany, to Scotland marked in blue pencil. Hess claimed that he had never been to Britain before. The Home Guard members offered him cigarettes, but he replied that he did not smoke. He was surprised to see so much fresh milk and took half a glass, saying that he had felt unwell for a long time in the plane and that his ankle was very painful. Although he had a camera with him, he did not take any pictures. He was very calm when he spoke. He thanked the Home Guard members when he left the farm and gave them a teacup as a souvenir. The plane had another fuel tank to prevent it from running out of fuel mid-flight, but he threw this fuel tank into the sea near the Scottish coast. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Hess's Nanny Knows Him Well</p>
<p>London. Berlin now claims that Hess has reduced his responsibilities due to mental confusion and that his defection to Scotland is meaningless both internally and externally. At the same time, the Berlin Nazi Party indicated that Hess clearly harbored the illusion that he could bring about an understanding with England. Yesterday, a Reuters correspondent in Cairo interviewed Paula, Hess's former nanny. According to Paula, "I don't believe that Hess is mentally disturbed. I believe that a serious split must have occurred within the Nazi Party, or that Hess has other ambitious plans. I was Hess's nanny, so I know him well. Hess is broad-minded, morally strong, and very honest in his dealings with people. Whether at school or elsewhere, he always strived to be the best. He often discussed important political issues with his father. From a young age, he believed that Germany was invincible." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Hess's Wife and Children Still in Germany</p>
<p>London. A dispatch from Rome, citing sources in Berlin, states that Hess's wife and children are still in Germany. Reports that they have gone to Turkey are inaccurate. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Answers Questions in the House of Commons; Hess's Flight to Britain is Truly Bizarre; More Statements to Follow Soon</h3>
<p>London. According to sources in the Swedish capital, Berlin is now eager to know what Hess will reveal to the British authorities. Prime Minister Churchill spoke yesterday in response to a request from the House of Commons, saying that more statements will be released soon regarding the defection of the German official to Britain. Some members of parliament said that it was unwise for the government to announce Hess's location, as German aircraft might fly there to bomb him to death, endangering the residents of Glasgow. The Prime Minister replied that Hess's location is not always Glasgow. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London. British Prime Minister Churchill declined to elaborate on Hess's flight to Britain during questioning in Parliament yesterday, saying that he had nothing more to add than the government's statement. "I remained in the Ministry of Information late last night. I believe that this incident is so bizarre that it confounds one's imagination," he said, at which point the members of parliament laughed. Regarding the bombing of the Houses of Parliament, the Prime Minister said that regardless of Germany's actions, the British Parliament would continue to work. The old House of Commons has been damaged to such an extent that it cannot be repaired in the long term, but we are actively building the third House of Parliament. Even if these buildings are destroyed, our parliamentary system will not be interrupted. (Editor's note: The dispatch did not state where yesterday's meeting was held).

<h3>Hitler Convenes Nazi Leaders' Meeting; Expresses Determination to Win the War; Declares He Does Not Acknowledge Hess's Statements in Britain</h3>
<p>Berlin. According to an official announcement by the Nazi Party last night, a meeting of key Nazi military leaders was held at Hitler's office yesterday, at which Hitler delivered a speech and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers by the attendees. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin. Official announcements stated that Hitler convened a meeting yesterday of key Nazi Party leaders and district leaders. After Hitler's address, the vast majority of attendees expressed their determination and willingness to fight to win the war. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin. German officials foreshadowed yesterday that the German Deputy Führer Hess, who fled to Britain, may issue a declaration, so they stated, "We will never acknowledge any statements made by Hess in Britain. We know very well that the British authorities will abuse all kinds of brutal methods to distort his words or even fabricate them." When asked whether Hess would be expelled from the party, the reply was that there were no formal steps yet, but of course such a person would no longer be fit to be a member of the party. The German people first heard the news of Hess's arrival in Britain during the daily news broadcast at 2 p.m., which read out the party's official announcement, which stated, "No one knows Führer Hitler's innermost peace proposals as well as Hess. Hess has clearly been misled by illusions, thinking that sacrificing himself might salvage the situation, because he believes that the outcome of the situation will not stop until Britain is completely destroyed."

<h3>German Coup About to Happen; Leader of the Black Front Speaks in the U.S.</h3>
<p>New York. Otto Strasser, the leader of the anti-Nazi Black Front, who is currently in exile, has subordinates who are still active in secret in Germany. Strasser has received secret reports that a coup to overthrow Hitler is about to take place. Strasser believes that Hess's departure is related to this matter. The International News Service Montreal correspondent asked Strasser by telephone yesterday, and he replied that he had received "accurate information" from Germany several weeks ago stating that "the senior command of the army is at odds with the Führer and has scheduled the appointment of a famous German general as the next military dictator." Strasser was one of the founders of the Nazi Party. His brother, Gregor Strasser, was killed during the 1934 purge, and Strasser fled into exile that year. Strasser said at the end, "Hess knows that the army leaders hate him just as they hate the Führer, Himmler, and other Nazi leaders, with the exception of General Göring."

<h3>Malta Continues to Be Bombed; This is the 601st Time Since Italy Entered the War</h3>
<p>Malta. Axis aircraft launched continuous attacks on Malta day and night on Sunday, the 601st time since Italy entered the war. A British communiqué stated that although many bombs fell on Malta, there were no casualties among the military or civilians, and the damage to civilian housing was minor and negligible. After an enemy air raid yesterday morning, a reconnaissance plane slipped in under cover to spy. In the afternoon, a small squadron of bombers, escorted by a large number of fighters, slipped in to drop bombs. There was some material damage. Hurricane-type British aircraft engaged enemy fighters while on patrol, damaging several enemy aircraft. Civilian casualties were few. Government offices, civilian houses, and churches were hit by bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Croatia Border Treaty Formally Signed</h3>
<p>Zagreb. Germany and Croatia signed a border treaty yesterday.

According to the treaty, Karlovy is only a few kilometers from the Dalmatian border. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Darlan Returns to Vichy; French Cabinet Met Yesterday Morning; Listened to Detailed Report on Negotiations; No Agreement Reached Between France and Germany</h3>
<p>Pétain Also Held Lengthy Talks with the U.S. Ambassador</p>
<p>Vichy. An official communiqué stated that the Cabinet met this morning, chaired by Marshal Pétain himself, to hear Darlan's detailed report on the recent French-German negotiations. The Cabinet immediately expressed unanimous approval. The consequences of these negotiations will soon become clear. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Cabinet Secretary Darlan returned here from Paris at 6 p.m. last night and immediately met with Marshal Pétain to report. The French official news agency was authorized yesterday afternoon to issue a report on the Darlan-Hitler-Ribbentrop meeting. This is the first time the French public has learned that these important negotiations are underway. Liu Wei said that the purpose and outcome of this meeting, as well as the price that France should pay in the provisional agreement to replace the armistice treaty, will not be announced in the near future. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Vichy. The French government issued an official gazette last night stating that the agreement signed by Germany and France in Paris on May 7 will take effect at the end of this month. The agreement stipulates the opening of traffic and remittances between the occupied and unoccupied zones, but foreign exchange is still prohibited. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Well-informed sources stated that the Cabinet meeting this morning discussed what decision should be made regarding the recent French-German talks. The nature of the meeting was unusually important. Darlan's negotiations with the German side were entirely in accordance with the instructions given by Marshal Pétain. Although the initial exchange of views has ended, no agreement has been reached. According to various sources, the content of Darlan's talks with the German side was very extensive. It is not easy to say exactly what the outcome will be. What is known is that these talks are a continuation of the Montoire meeting on November 24 last year (i.e., the meeting between Pétain and Hitler). With the Balkan war now over, and with the exception of Gibraltar, there are no longer any traces of British troops on the European continent. Germany is clearly thinking about the problem of European organization, and the question of what position France should occupy in the future organization is one of the current problems. The underlying purpose of Darlan's meeting with Hitler lies here, and the focus of discussion at the Cabinet meeting this morning also lies here. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Vichy. After a lengthy conversation with U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy yesterday, Marshal Pétain held secret talks with Darlan. It is believed that Pétain and Leahy discussed the situation of French-German relations, as well as the current situation of the French colonies and the Syrian mandate.

<h3>Great Strength of British Navy Still Controls the Mediterranean; Record of Last Week's Naval and Air Battles</h3>
<p>London. A Reuters correspondent cabled from the British warship "Barham" of the Mediterranean Fleet that enemy aircraft attempted to imitate the British naval air force's tactic of destroying the Italian fleet at Taranto in an attack on a British battle fleet sailing in the central Mediterranean. However, they were repelled by more than 30 British warships firing their guns. The British warships suffered no damage. A brief report on this battle was published by the Admiralty on Saturday and Sunday. The details are as follows. When the encounter occurred, British warships fired on enemy torpedo planes for 40 minutes. The reporter had never seen such intense gunfire at night. The moon was bright, and the escorting British cruisers opened fire several miles away. The large guns of the British battleships, up to six inches, roared immediately, while a large squadron of destroyers fired a cone-shaped barrage of fire into the sky to protect the battle fleet, in case of possible high-altitude bombing. When the battle fleet opened fire, the enemy aircraft apparently abandoned the escort and split into several squadrons, attacking the battle fleet from all sides. The reporter, looking from the "Barham," saw the fleet lined up in a long row, breaking the waves, with gunfire erupting from all sides, a truly spectacular sight. All the six-inch and eight-inch guns and rapid-fire guns, as well as machine guns, were firing, down to the sea surface and up to the sky, creating a dense web of fire. Each warship was flashing with fire from bow to stern, the sound of gunfire was deafening, and the hull was shaking. The voices of the officers issuing orders were drowned out by the gunfire. The protective barrage of fire fired by the destroyers densely surrounded the battleships, with fragments hitting the sea and water splashing. Occasionally, the gunfire would subside slightly, and the sound of clearing the shell casings would follow, preparing for continued bombardment. The last British warship initially seemed to be evading the attack, but there were no torpedo explosions near the British warships. It was night, so it was impossible to know the results of the bombardment with certainty. When the gunfire stopped, a dense fog suddenly descended. The British fleet suffered no damage. When this fierce battle occurred, the British fleet was routinely deployed to escort British ships to and from the central Mediterranean and bombard the port of Benghazi. During the seven-day period, small squadrons of Axis aircraft repeatedly attacked the British fleet, but were intercepted and scattered by the British naval air force several miles from the fleet. Seven enemy aircraft were shot down. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Tojo Issues Warning: Japan Will Be Drawn Into War; Tokyo Holds Chiefs of Staff Conference; Taiwan Will Become Heart of Japan's Southern Advance</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Army Minister Tojo warned today that the war has spread globally and Japan will be involved. He also boasted that the strength of the Japanese army is unparalleled.

The wars in Europe and Asia are intertwined, so the confrontation in the two continents has the potential to become a world war. For a nation to overcome difficulties and develop, it relies entirely on the army. The strength of the Japanese army is unparalleled." The Army Minister urged those attending the conference to double their efforts to maintain the glorious traditions of the army and cultivate combat power. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Informal Talks on the European War (55): The Decline of Mussolini</h3>
<p>With the Italian army defeated in Africa, the domestic situation in Italy deteriorates daily. Mussolini, once a hero, has become an appendage of Hitler. The Christian Science Monitor's correspondent in Rome, Mr. [Name], recently returned and has written several articles for the newspaper, discussing the inside story of Italy, with much valuable material. The following is one of those articles.</p>
<p>A well-respected neutral observer in Rome said in early February this year, "This year, Italy has no responsible government. Anything can happen."</p>
<p>This statement reveals the current weakness of the Mussolini government. The people of Rome know of the collapse of the African Empire, and Mussolini, who was awarded the title of "Creator of the Empire," is now publicly called "Destroyer of the Empire."</p>
<p>Most of the key government officials have departed for the front lines. The secondary officials remaining in Rome are eager to contact Mussolini to request instructions, but they have been turned away. Revolutionary plots are about to erupt.</p>
<p>"Where has Mussolini gone?" As the political situation becomes increasingly chaotic, everyone is pursuing this question.</p>
<p>It turns out that Mussolini is going through an unprecedented crisis. People close to him say that the Prime Minister's spirit has suffered a major blow, making it difficult for him to recover. The blow, of course, refers to the series of defeats suffered by Italy in Africa. Another person who knows him well says that he has lost his normal state in both public and private matters.</p>
<p>According to a few people who have met with Mussolini, the Prime Minister has had disagreements with at least some of his most trusted advisors. He blames the Italian setbacks on individuals. Not only that, but he is simply at a loss on how to deal with the current crisis. His only path is to follow Germany and take a desperate gamble, hoping to share in the spoils of victory in the European situation. But this method is obviously a bad move, merely turning Italy into a German dependency, following Berlin's orders.</p>
<p>Two weeks before I left Rome, I heard that Mussolini had dismissed even his most loyal old comrade, Farinacci (former Secretary-General of the Fascist Party). With key officials gone, the remaining underlings are inevitably overwhelmed, without the power to give orders. They can only rely on Mussolini alone to struggle desperately.</p>
<p>I am discussing Mussolini not to sensationalize, but for unavoidable reasons. First, since Italy joined the war, Mussolini has become a personal dictator, so to describe the current situation in Italy, one must focus on Mussolini. Second, due to Mussolini's personal decline, German political police and technicians have been able to control the core of Italy in the name of assistance, forcing Mussolini to follow Hitler.</p>
<p>That being said, Mussolini's regime is not about to end just yet. Germany is providing "sustenance" to help him consolidate his foundation. Germany acknowledges that Mussolini is the best friend of Germany in Italy. Otherwise, if someone else came to power, there would be a danger of turning to Britain.</p>
<p>We have every reason to believe that Hitler is prepared to honor his agreement to aid Mussolini for a considerable period in order to shore up his "older brother's" reputation. However, the pain is only known to the Fascist leaders, as one of the party's key figures said to someone with a heavy heart, "I am extremely depressed."</p>
<p>Mussolini's political illness may one day be cured, just like his sudden appearances and disappearances on the political stage. But in Rome today, shouting "Mussolini is finished" will certainly not help him to recover, that is certain.</p>
<p>Mussolini is not entirely ignorant of Hitler. When he first met Hitler, he said to his son-in-law, Foreign Minister Ciano, "I can cooperate with Hitler when necessary. But Hitler and I can never be bosom buddies."</p>
<p>Mussolini's view never changed. Until Italy's defeat, the Fascists still liked to act alone, which often made Berlin extremely difficult to deal with. Although the communiqués issued after each meeting between Mussolini and Hitler stated that "both sides were in complete agreement," Mussolini's attempt to exert his influence and compete with Hitler was well known.</p>
<p>So why is Mussolini following Hitler so closely, even at the risk of a desperate gamble? This requires recalling what Mussolini said to Ciano after he failed to prevent Hitler from annexing Austria.</p>
<p>"One day," he said, "Germany will be invincible in Europe. At that time, I will form an alliance with Germany."</p>
<p>In May 1939, the "day" Mussolini had hoped for arrived. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Hitler told him successively that Germany was confident of winning every battle. Ribbentrop even explained Germany's plan to conquer Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Britain in order.</p>
<p>Germany followed the plan, and it was perfectly accurate until France was defeated. Mussolini felt that he was really a good judge of people and could not help but feel proud. Before, he criticized others for "being in a dangerous situation," but now he himself was preparing to do the same.</p>
<p>Mussolini is a practical man. After recognizing his mistakes, he strives to make amends. On the eve of my departure from Rome, a diplomat told me, "Mussolini, regardless of everything, is increasingly pro-German, hoping to save his position."</p>
<p>Mussolini's most recent meeting with Hitler in Germany took place after the Italian army's disastrous defeat in Libya. Someone saw him getting on the train, full of melancholy, irritated by everyone. But when he returned, he was smiling again, as usual.</p>
<p>But Mussolini is different now than he was in the past.</p>
<p>According to rumors in Rome, someone discovered Mussolini in his office one day holding an umbrella.</p>
<p>"But it's not raining," a friend reminded him.</p>
<p>"Yes," Mussolini replied, "but it's raining in Berlin!"</p>

<h3>Food: Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Sale of Rice; First Batch of 50,000 Bags Arrives Complete; Foreign Rice Drops Slightly, Japonica Rice Still Rises</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's purchase of Rangoon small-grain foreign rice, the first 5,000 tons, has arrived in full. The first batch of over 11,100 bags, loaded on the Taikoo Hanyang and Ewo Mingsheng ships, has been shipped from Hong Kong and arrived on Sunday (11th). Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Taikoo Taiyuan ship also loaded 10,000 bags, and the Jiangsu ship also loaded 15,000 bags. Both ships arrived in the evening of the 12th and have now been completely unloaded. The four ships together carried over 56,100 bags, totaling over 5,000 tons. Therefore, the first purchase of foreign rice has all arrived in Shanghai. Subsequently, it can be continuously transported, and there is no worry about food supply, and the price can also be reduced. (Source)</p>
<p>The market for foreign rice yesterday saw a straight-line downward trend. Spot rice fell a total of about three yuan in the morning and afternoon. Futures rice fell slightly by one or two yuan in the morning and two or three yuan in the afternoon. The trend is even weaker and more listless. The rumors on the market that were favorable to the bulls have been dispelled because more than 50,000 bags of Hong Kong rice have all arrived in Shanghai and are about to be sold. In addition to the second batch of Hong Kong rice being negotiated, there is also an announcement that the first batch of Vietnamese rice sold at a flat price will arrive in Shanghai in the middle of the month. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of bags of rice in stock on the market, a large number of chips for the April and May futures rice will also arrive in Shanghai one after another. With such a large supply, sales are waiting and watching. Speculators and those who are not strong-willed are all eager to sell at a reduced price. Therefore, the rice market fell sharply after the opening. Small-grain rice opened at 117 yuan and then fell by half a yuan or one yuan to 115 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell again from 115 yuan to 113 yuan. Broken rice fell to 80 yuan. Also, Saigon fire-grain rice has not yet opened for sale in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere may fall by another one or two yuan. English Mou's is even weaker and difficult to revive. Saigon No. 1 April and May opened at 143.5 yuan in the morning and fell to 139 yuan in the afternoon. Broken rice fell to 110.05 yuan in the morning and was only bid at 10.08 yuan in the afternoon, which is four, five, or six yuan less than the previous day. The total daily transaction volume was 15,000 bags of spot rice and over 700 tons of futures.</p>
<p>Domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice, because its source has suddenly experienced a sharp drop, transporters have mostly stopped, resulting in a sparse arrival of goods. Merchants are generally unwilling to sell lightly. At the same time, local shops, etc., seeing that the market has presented a fluctuating situation, are thinking of taking this opportunity to purchase goods, so the sales market feels active. The price of both thick and thin japonica rice has risen by about two yuan. Tin japonica is quoted at 140 yuan. Kunshan white japonica rose from 138 yuan to 135 yuan. Nangang early and late rice rose from 136 yuan to 132 or 133 yuan. Original bag is 138.5 yuan or 138 yuan.</p>
<p>The route for glutinous rice is still not wide, only scattered demand from food vendors, etc. As a result, in the midst of the weakness of foreign rice, the situation also appears soft. Hong Kong white yuan is quoted at 117.3 yuan or 117 yuan, and Nuo Lu is 107 or 108 yuan.</p>
<p>The flour market is still downstream.</p>
<p>The current situation of the foreign flour market is still downstream. Because the price of rice continues to fall and foreign flour orders are arriving one after another, people's hearts are ultimately weak. Therefore, when the market falls slightly, buyers immediately stand by and watch. Australian flour from the Flower Bird Bell Tower brand is lacking buyers. Only the Golden Dragon brand and the Fort brand are making slight improvements. Golden Dragon flour still needs to open at 30.085 yuan, and then it will loosen to 7 jiao, 6 jiao, and 5 jiao. The Fort brand is 31 yuan to 30.095 yuan. There were five or six thousand bags of transactions. The future of the market needs to wait for the actual sales to unfold before there is hope of recovery. The factory's flat-priced flour is still 29 yuan. However, when the Japanese flour market is falling, the needs of this street are also not greedy. It is heard that the factory price will also be lowered when necessary.</p>
<p>Wheat trading is as stagnant as usual. Because the arrival of goods from the mainland has long been cut off, the raw materials of each flour mill are also waiting for the new wheat to be launched on the market before buying. Only the Japanese factory's front door occasionally receives goods, and the price has been reduced by one or two yuan. It is heard that the price of Gao Du wheat is 46 or 47 yuan. The market still needs to be watched cautiously.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Are Rising</h3>
<p>The situation of government bonds in the off-market yesterday, because after the intraday retracement, the brokers wanted to raise prices again, so as not to fall again. Temporarily, it actually worked. Generally, those who follow the trend filled short positions and went long. Whether the price increase has continued, let's wait and see. Yesterday morning, Xinhua, Sinfu, and Hefeng bought in, and Lianhe, Yitai, and Delong sold out. General retail investors were also very enthusiastic about buying in. The market price was low and then high, and the midday close was good for about four jiao. In the afternoon, it continued to pull up. The market price rose and fell suddenly, flickering and uncertain. Tongkang bought in, which caused Lianyi, Dingkang, and Xinhua to help raise prices, while Lianhe and Yichang came out at high prices. More than 90% of Dunyu Yitai also released. The market price fell several times, but was still raised. As a result, they all closed back well, with seven jiao to eight and a half jiao. The transaction volume was 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Shanghai Stock Exchange shares were traded at a price of 50 yuan.</p>
<p>The public stock market is more optimistic, and the trading is quite active. Soon, rumors suddenly arose, causing the market to soften immediately. The closing price returned up again, and the potential is still good.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Wednesday) telegram. Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies in the Far East remain flat. Only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British-registered shares rose by half a pound, priced at 72 pounds. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Enterprise Company Has Been Liquidated and Dissolved</h3>
<p>In the past year, there have been no less than six or seven new foreign stocks publicly raised by Jewish people in Shanghai. The Shanghai Enterprise Company, which was the first to be recruited and established, was resolved by the board of directors last Saturday to be automatically liquidated. This is also a small vicissitude in the Shanghai foreign stock market.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Enterprise Company was originally a private company, and its shares were held equally by International Trust and Yangzi Bank. They were the ones who allocated some real estate held by the two companies to supplement capital. A year ago, through the hands of Luan &amp; Co., 180,000 shares were sold to the outside world at a price of 5.5 yuan per share (par value 5 yuan), and the remaining 140,000 shares were still in the hands of the two companies. Later, in order to expand business, 600,500 new shares were re-raised, and management rights were transferred from accountant Tan Shipang to Wheelock &amp; Co. In the second half of last year, the stock price often called for around 5 yuan. This spring, a dividend of one cent was issued for the previous year, and the market price rose slightly.</p>
<p>Recently, the company sent a circular to its shareholders stating that all real estate has been sold one after another. Originally, the company's main business was the sale and purchase of real estate. Now, in view of the fact that most of the people who purchase real estate in Shanghai are people who live outside of Shanghai, and they have other purposes, and the income is not their question, so the price is getting higher and higher, and the operators have no interest to plan. Therefore, it is planned to abandon this business and specialize in investing and buying and selling stocks in this city, or immediately engage in liquidation. These two matters seek shareholders' opinions to decide the future actions.</p>
<p>According to the company's circular this time, it is known that the company currently has 2.65 million yuan in cash, and various active assets, including shareholders in this city, are worth approximately 4,016,820 yuan according to the closing price on April 25. If it is decided to continue business, it is planned to issue an interim dividend of 1 yuan. If it is decided to dissolve the liquidation, it is planned to distribute cash and most of the International Trust shares held back to the shareholders.</p>
<p>Now the company has decided to liquidate and dissolve. According to the company's shares, there are a total of 925,000 shares. It is now decided to issue 1.25 yuan per share for this year's profit in late May, and the rest will be liquidated after a special meeting of shareholders is convened. Although the foreign stock price is much lower than the closing price on April 25, such as the International Trust's weekly statistics price this week, it is only about 27 yuan, which is more than 2 yuan less. The company's assets have of course fallen along with it. But in general, in addition to profits, it seems that the original capital can be recovered. (According to the market price estimated on April 25, if it is dissolved, the property of each share is worth about 7 yuan.) (Xuan Wen)</p>

<h3>After the Swap, the Gold Market Seems</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was dark in the off-market. When it was the swap day from this May to June, it had already started to be pre-done at 8 o'clock in the morning. The seller posted out to the buyer, initially calling for 40 yuan. Later, it was heard that Juduo, Xinfengyong, Dafeng, Xinyuan, and Chengji were all watching and not advancing. The posted price gradually increased to 50 yuan before there was a formal transaction. Yifeng and Defu posted out huge amounts, and Hengji also posted out. The price then gradually rose to 57 yuan. At 8:15, the license plate was posted, and the seller posted out 55 yuan. Later, Xinfengyong, Chengji, and Dalai all came to post in. It continued to retreat to 50 yuan. Finally, 52 or 3 yuan.

Dafeng and Hengji suddenly came out to cage, and Taiyong also sold, suppressing it to 6,470 yuan. For Chi Da, Cheng Da, and Xinfengyong strongly advanced, raising it to around 6,490 yuan, with a slight fluctuation. At 10:45, the foreign exchange reported tight, and it was difficult to settle June US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, so people's hearts were even firmer. Xinyuan, Dafeng, and Defu advanced sharply, floating short positions and cutting them off, and sellers were at a loss. The price then flew out of 6,500 yuan and reached 6,518 yuan. After 11:10, Gonghe and Deda came out sharply, and there were negative rumors, and the foreign exchange reported hard.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Speculative Minds Uneasy, Yarn Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The yarn market is once again in a state of flux, with rumors abounding, causing anxieties to swirl like hemp. This is due to the unsettled minds of speculators, leading to sudden rises and falls in the market. However, actual transactions remain as dull as ever. Except for some demand for coarse yarn from Hong Kong merchants, there is no appetite for anything else. Some say that 20-count yarn from other ports is cheap, making it unprofitable for traders. However, large players who have purchased remain unmoved, reportedly because raw materials are not loosening, and they have no intention of selling. It is said that the factories are keeping their Shuang Ma yarn orders closed, and the supply of warehouse receipts is unusually tight. Therefore, those betting on price increases are once again actively buying. 20-count Single Horse yarn reached a high of $1486 and a low of $1448. In the early afternoon, it traded at $1470, rising to $1476 before falling back to $1472, with the final price at $1476.</p>
<p>The Shuang Ma market opened well in the morning, with some inclination to buy due to rising American cotton. The opening price was $1455, falling slightly to $1450. Then, news came that short positions on margin calls were being posted, and those betting on higher prices mostly bought more, causing the market to gradually rise to $1476. Some profits were taken along the way, but the consensus in the market was bullish, even though actual demand was minimal. It rose all the way to $1486. Unexpectedly, as the price rose, a sudden reversal occurred, and with the return of rumors, margin calls fell by $100 in an instant. Sellers suddenly became active, and securities firms collectively sold off, causing the price to plummet to $1448. However, after 12 o'clock, it was said that the various rumors were inaccurate, and buyers became active again, causing the market to rise and close at $1469. The total trading volume for the day was 15,780 bales. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 15,000; Hong Kong merchants: 780</p>
<p>Total: 15,780</p>
<h3>Cotton Market on Solid Footing</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly better. Due to the sharp rise in American cotton, a slight contraction in foreign exchange rates, and good yarn prices, sentiment is firm, and holders are generally unwilling to sell. Fine cotton raw materials remain very strong, but factory demand is not yet very strong. Yesterday, a total of 460 bales were traded, with prices rising by $5-6.</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton: 409 bales, traded by Qingsheng, 235 bales</p>
<p>Middling cotton: 417 bales, traded by Jiufeng, 100 bales</p>
<p>Also: 421 bales, traded by Jifeng, 125 bales</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai says that foreign cotton transactions by foreign firms remain stagnant due to weak factory demand. However, due to the frequent increases in overseas freight rates and the repeated price increases in American and Indian cotton, the cotton market is on a relatively solid footing.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market saw enthusiastic buying due to Washington political news, smooth progress of the National Government, the impact of the 85% cotton and wheat loan, and good cotton cloth trading conditions. Market sentiment was upbeat, and the market became more active and bullish. Yesterday's closing prices were $0.50 to $0.70 higher per pound than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to factory purchases, followed by profit-taking, and finally rose again due to speculative buying and strong overseas markets. As a result, closing prices, except for White Broach for April and May, which rose by 10 rupees, rose by 1 to 4 rupees.</p>
<p>It is predicted that the market will open higher by 5.75 rupees today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang Have the Highest Cloth Sales</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fluctuated, and sentiment was erratic. Prices rose steadily in the morning, but there was a brief reversal near noon, followed by another rise in the afternoon. As a result, white cloth, fine cloth, and twill cloth each rose by $0.50 to $1, while coarse cloth rose by $0.25 to $0.50. Bleached and dyed cloth also saw increased demand. Sales to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and foreign merchants were the strongest, while demand from other routes was mediocre, due to the continued control of transportation routes. About 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street, with Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants buying over 400 pieces of twill and colored cloth, and foreign merchants from Siam and other places buying over 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Prices rose and then fell, before rising again. As a result, fine cloth rose by $0.50, and fine twill rose by about $1. Longtou fine cloth closed at $49 after the current warehouse receipts were traded. Sijunzi serge was at $1.52. The market was particularly active, but most of the transactions were speculative, and actual sales to customers remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Woolens: Firm and Weak Conditions Vary</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen market saw limited trading with foreign merchants, but very active trading within this street. Looking at the sales prices of various goods, conditions varied between firm and weak. Items such as autumn-selling medium-thick dark-colored flannels, serge, heavy-weight woolen fabric, official Western suit woolens, fireproof Four-Brand Harris tweed, winter-selling Malle and other flat thick woolens, men's and women's colored overcoat woolens, long-haired velvet, mohair velvet, straight tribute shoe felt, etc., were mostly firm and expensive. Items such as 巴勒呢 (Bale tweed), 胖別取 (Pangbiequ), feather yarn woolens, white serge, white tribute, linen rubber cloth, etc., were mostly flat and weak. Palissy was in continued decline. The Yihua Palissy, which sold for $22 per yard last month, sold for $18.75 yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sees Some Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw no movement in New York. The opening price of raw silk in Yokohama was ¥10 higher than the previous day, with the near-term July contract at ¥1535 and the forward contract slightly higher by ¥6 than the previous day. Local foreign silk firms continued to make transactions. 特上 Tussah silk sold for $4975, first-grade for $4675, and second-grade for $4625. Yihua and Dachang, etc., bought about 30-odd bales. White filature silk 20/22, with evenness of 7/8, also saw some sales at $6200. However, due to the scarcity of controlled goods, transactions were limited.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sugar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended downwards, leading to a continued sharp drop. The Association's futures market for coarse white sugar, with delivery on the 20th of this month, opened at $111.20, falling to $111.10, $110.05, $110.30, $110.40, $110.10, and $109.70, closing at $110.04, a drop of $2.30. Those with delivery at the end of the month initially traded at $113, falling to $112.60, $112.10, $112.20, $112, $111.90, $111.60, $111.40, $111, and $110.75, a small drop of $3.30. Taikoo granulated sugar also fell along with coarse sugar, with B mark at $112, a small drop of $2, and HX mark at $98.50.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Bamboo Shoots Offer Freshness</h3>
<p>The first batch of fresh bamboo shoots arrived yesterday, totaling 60 pieces, and were immediately offered for sale at a price of $370, which is quite high. The market is very brisk.</p>
<h3>Coal: New Shipment of White Coal Arriving Soon</h3>
<p>—Price Increased by Another $30—</p>
<p>It has been widely rumored in the market that a large shipment of new Hongji white coal is about to arrive in port. However, traders in the same industry increased the price by another $30 yesterday, raising it from $400 to $430 per ton by truckload, similar to the black market price. At this time of slow sales, the price is being raised again and again, which is puzzling. Therefore, stores in this street have also raised their prices, with lump coal selling for $460 per ton, and screened coal for $476, delivered to customers, including transportation costs.</p>
<h3>Sundries: Matches, Candles, Soap—Prices All Dropped Slightly</h3>
<p>The prices of daily necessities have been falling for several days, and hoarders both inside and outside the industry are eager to sell, with few new hoarders. Prices are generally flat and weak. Yesterday, the market saw Meili brand matches selling for $700 per case, and Fenghuang brand for $691 per case, both down by more than $20. Guben soap sold for $56.50 per case, Baixiangmao soap for $47 per case, and Huangxiangmao soap for $44 per case, all down by $2-3. Ship brand candles sold for $27 per case. The market atmosphere is unlikely to improve.</p>

<h3>New US Ambassador to China Arrives in Shanghai, Leaves for Provisional Capital This Morning to Assume Office. American Community Held Welcome Banquet Last Night. Ambassador Denies Statements Attributed to Him by Japanese Sources. New Commander of US Fourth Marine Regiment, Howard, Arrives on Same Ship.</h3>
<p>The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, and the new Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Howard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM on the US Mail Steamship Company's latest ship, the President Garfield, from the United States. The ship docked at buoys 12 and 13 in the Huangpu River. US Consul General Lockwood, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet Rear Admiral Glassford, the current Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment Colonel Baker, and the President of the American Community Association, Dr. Hinsdale, all boarded the ship to welcome them. They accompanied the two gentlemen, dividing into two US Navy special motorboats, and landed at the Customs Wharf at around 9:00 AM. Ambassador Gauss will stay here overnight and is scheduled to depart on the same ship for Hong Kong at 11:30 AM today to fly to Chongqing to assume his new post. Commander Howard is scheduled to be officially sworn in within a few days. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Transit Through Japan</p>
<p>The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, traveled to Chongqing to assume his new post on the US President Line's newest giant ship, the President Garfield, and passed through Shanghai yesterday morning (the 14th), making a brief stop. Reporters boarded the ship to interview him. Gauss completely denied the Japanese news agency's report that he had said a military conference would soon be held in Singapore. He stated that he did not make any statements to the Japanese press while passing through Japan, so the news reported by the Japanese news agency has no basis. He knows nothing about military affairs, and this trip is only to go to Chongqing to take up his new post.</p>
<p>Enjoyable Time in Australia</p>
<p>When asked about US aid to China, Gauss said that he had only just arrived in Shanghai and could not comment. He added that he had a very enjoyable time as the first US Minister to Australia and that Australia itself is a very interesting country. Gauss refused to make any further comments, saying that he could not discuss any issues while en route to Chongqing to take up his new post.</p>
<p>US Officials Meet and Greet with Pleasure</p>
<p>After the President Garfield arrived in port yesterday morning, Commander of the US Navy Yangtze Patrol Force Rear Admiral Glassford, US Consul General in Shanghai Lockwood, US Judge Advocate General Helmholtz, and Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment Colonel Baker all boarded the ship to welcome him. Gauss met with them and was overjoyed. He then chatted happily with several journalists for a moment before leaving the ship and transferring to a US Navy supply motorboat to disembark at the Bund.</p>
<p>Porter Likely Accompanying to Chongqing</p>
<p>When Gauss was the US Consul General in Shanghai last year, he was appointed as the first US Minister to Australia. Recently, he was promoted to US Ambassador to China to succeed Johnson. Former Acting US Consul General in Shanghai Porter likely also boarded the President Garfield to accompany Gauss to Chongqing. It is said that Mr. Porter will stay in Chongqing for a short time before returning to Beijing to take up his post as Counselor at the US Embassy.</p>
<p>Grand Banquet by American Community Organizations</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the American Community Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held a banquet at the Columbia Country Club to welcome Ambassador Gauss. Public and private organizations attending included the US Consulate, the American Community Association, the American Chamber of Commerce, the American General Association, the US Yangtze River Fleet, the US Fourth Marine Regiment, the American Women's General Federation, the American Association of University Women, the American United Church, and other business organizations. Lockwood, Baker, Glassford, and Hinsdale all gave welcome speeches. This welcome event was the broadest gathering of the American community in Shanghai, and the number of participants was unprecedented. However, because the event was of significant importance, it was not open to non-American guests. As Mr. Gauss had extensive contacts during his previous tenure as US Consul General in Shanghai, yesterday's welcome meeting must have been attended by many dignitaries, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard Inspects Troops</p>
<p>The newly appointed Commander of the US Marine Corps Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Howard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 14th) on the President Garfield. The current Commander of the Regiment, Colonel Baker, boarded the ship to welcome him. Mr. Howard also met with other US officials yesterday morning, such as Commander of the US Navy Yangtze Patrol Force Rear Admiral Glassford, US Consul General in Shanghai Lockwood, and President of the American Community Association Dr. Hinsdale. It is reported that the US military will conduct maneuvers at the Racecourse on Saturday morning, to be inspected by Mr. Howard and Mr. Baker. Mr. Howard joined the Marine Corps in 1914 and served in Haiti the following year. After the United States entered the war, he served in the Atlantic on the US ships Wheeling, Georgia, and New Mexico. In 1921, he was stationed in Washington. The following year, he was transferred to Santo Domingo. In 1924, when the US Marine Corps Fourth Marine Regiment was stationed in Santo Domingo, Mr. Howard once served in the Regiment.</p>
<p>Famous Figures Arrive on the Same Ship</p>
<p>The newly appointed Spanish Consul General to Manila, Carduna, also passed through Shanghai on the President Garfield, but declined to discuss the European situation or the possibility of Spain's participation in the war. Other passengers on the ship included the Bolivian Consul General to Singapore, Monteneegro, a reporter from the Combined Press, Ms. Du, and the General Manager of Standard Oil Company of New York in Shanghai, Mr. Tugot, who was returning to Shanghai after taking a vacation in the United States. Ms. Du of the Combined Press was previously a feature writer for the US Tribune. This trip is to Chongqing, where she plans to engage in Red Cross work and film activities during her work.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Several American Nationals Are Secretly Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that several American men and women have recently returned to Shanghai secretly. Their method is to purchase tickets from Manila to Honolulu and disembark in Shanghai en route. Regarding this matter, it is said that all American passports are printed with the law that anyone who violates these legal restrictions and returns to Shanghai will be fined US$2,000, or imprisoned for up to five years, or both fined and imprisoned. This law applies to American nationals who return to Shanghai without official permission, but those whose passports are still valid in China are not affected.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Has No Intention of Returning to Shanghai for the Time Being</h3>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing went to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing, he has been busy inspecting industries in various places. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired with associates of Mr. Yu yesterday morning, Mr. Yu will be stationed in Chongqing for a long time because the Sanbei Company in Chongqing is his business. He has no intention of returning to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<p>New US Ambassador to China, Gauss, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The new US Ambassador to China, Mr. Gauss, together with the new Counselor of the US Embassy to Ping, Mr. Brick, and the new Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Howard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the US Mail Steamship Company's President Garfield.

<h3>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Issues Open Letter to British Nationals Urging Eligible British Nationals to Consider Enlistment</h3>
<p>A reporter from Pingming News Agency recently learned from the information office of the British Embassy in Shanghai that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, will today issue an open letter to all British nationals in China, stating: "Every British national has a duty to serve in the military. In the past, I have indicated to you that fulfilling your duties in your current positions is also a way to contribute to the war effort. However, the situation has changed somewhat today. The country needs more men. All eligible British nationals in China should consider whether their current positions are more important than participating in the war. This applies particularly to young men between the ages of twenty and thirty (including those who are married or unmarried). Businesses should also consider that if young men enlist, we will not be able to take special measures if their ability to work far exceeds those who remain in their positions. While it is important for British commerce to maintain continued efficiency in China, it is more important to increase the number of enlisted personnel. I am confident that businesses will do their best to find ways to maintain efficiency and will not prevent young men in combat positions from leaving their jobs."</p>
<h3>Airplane Passengers to Hong Kong Must Be Vaccinated and Have Certificates of Immunization</h3>
<p>Traffic between Hong Kong and the mainland relies solely on air routes. The Hong Kong government recently announced that passengers flying from Hong Kong to Nanxiong, Guilin, Chongqing, Kunming, and to Lashio and Rangoon must complete vaccination procedures and obtain certificates of immunization before departure. The immunization procedures must be completed no more than three months and no less than five days before departure by receiving smallpox vaccination and cholera inoculation from a Hong Kong port doctor and purchasing a certificate of immunization, or a certificate issued by a doctor recognized by the Hong Kong government, endorsed by the port doctor, is also valid.</p>
<p>Same Procedure for Going to Rangoon</p>
<p>Also, passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay and Rangoon must be inoculated and vaccinated by a doctor recognized by the Hong Kong government before boarding the ship, and the validity period is six months. Certificates issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department are also recognized by the Hong Kong government. Therefore, those traveling from Shanghai to the mainland via Hong Kong only need to complete the above procedures in Shanghai to pass without hindrance.</p>
<p>Name of Certificate-Issuing Agency Changed</p>
<p>To cope with the current situation, the Hong Kong authorities announced the Immigration Ordinance on November 22 of last year to prevent undesirable elements from entering, requiring law-abiding residents entering Hong Kong to obtain an entry permit. According to news from the aviation industry, the Hong Kong authorities feared that the name "Immigration Bureau" might cause misunderstanding and announced a name change on the 28th of last month to "Immigration Affairs Bureau," while the English name remains the same. However, those who actually reside in Hong Kong do not need to obtain a permit.</p>
<h3>Business Labor Dispute to Be Resolved This Week</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Commercial Press has lasted for more than three weeks. Although Ms. Xing De and Mr. Lu Gaoyi came forward to mediate fairly, they were unable to resolve it as scheduled due to differences of opinion between labor and management. After Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Hong Kong branch, appointed Mr. Li Bojia to handle the matter in Shanghai, it still remained unresolved for a long time. It is now known that Mr. Li has reported in detail to the Hong Kong head office the various suggestions put forward by the employee association and the course of repeated meetings. On the 13th of this month, the employee association sent representatives to Mr. Li to discuss the resolution and strongly requested that the management withdraw the order to dismiss and transfer personnel. Mr. Li promised to make a final decision after receiving a reply from Hong Kong. It is said that the reply is expected to arrive within a week.</p>
<p>Tea Industry Treatment Resolved</p>
<p>It is now learned that the labor dispute in the tea manufacturing industry has been resolved through mediation by the Political Department of the Public Concession. The improved treatment conditions agreed upon by labor and management are recorded below: (1) A general cost-of-living subsidy of CN$1.25 will be added to each worker, bringing the total wage to CN$2.50. (2) An additional CN$0.20 will be provided for meals each day, and an additional CN$0.20 for snacks each night for night workers, bringing the total to CN$0.50. (3) Start-up fees and completion liquor, coveralls, etc., will be increased by CN$2, bringing the total to CN$4.</p>
<p>Color Printing Labor Relations Close</p>
<p>Due to the continued rise in the cost of living, the wages earned by workers in the color printing industry are insufficient to support their families. They have requested that management improve treatment and increase wages. The conditions they have put forward are: 5 dou of Saigon rice per person per month, wages below CN$30 to be increased by 120%, those from CN$41 to CN$80 to be increased by 100%, weekly rest, night work to be six hours per shift, and nine hours per day to be the standard, as well as holiday pay and severance pay, etc. However, management has not made any indication. The workers then started a slowdown yesterday. It is now reported that more than a dozen printing factories, such as Xiehe, Zhonghua, Sida, and Dahua, have requested Zhuang Ping to act as mediator. After Mr. Zhuang explained openly and fairly, both sides have gradually moved closer to agreement. Once the workers put forward representatives to negotiate, the slowdown can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Small Newspaper Printing Workers Lose Jobs</p>
<p>The Newspaper Friends Mutual Aid Association, composed of workers in the printing of small newspapers, has decided that (1) to prevent increased unemployment, limit the indiscriminate admission of apprentices; (2) register unemployed members to find ways to introduce them to jobs; (3) draft a work outline; (4) solicit owners of printing shops as sponsors; and (5) seek the opinions of members to find ways to improve.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Encourages and Assists the Inland Transport of Steel</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered relevant organizations to encourage and assist the inland transport of steel. The measures are recorded below: (1) The Steel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) will handle the encouragement and assistance of inland transport of steel materials in accordance with these measures and relevant laws and regulations. (2) The term "inland transport" as used in these measures refers to the transport of various steel materials (including old and scrap steel materials) from foreign countries or coastal provinces or various war zones to the rear. (3) Manufacturers who intend to purchase and transport steel materials inland must first register with the Committee. (4) For steel materials transported inland, the Committee may consult with the transportation authorities to provide convenience for available vehicles and will inform the relevant agencies along the route to provide assistance. (5) Steel materials transported inland from foreign countries may be transported into the country first and then apply for a transportation permit. Those transported inland from various war zones may apply for a permit from the construction departments of the provinces to which the districts belong, as entrusted by the Committee, or directly from the Committee. (6) A request may first be made to the Committee to allocate or introduce manufacturers to purchase the steel materials to be transported inland and to ensure their reasonable profits. The owners of the steel materials may retain as much as possible for their own use within the scope of their actual needs if they are using manufacturers. (7) All purchasing and transportation costs required for the inland transport of steel materials may be handled by the Committee on behalf of the Sino-China, Communications, Agricultural, and Central Banks Joint Office to facilitate remittances. (8) After the steel materials transported inland arrive at the rear sales location, they should be registered with the Committee, and the transportation permit should be submitted to the Committee for cancellation. (9) After the steel materials transported inland arrive at the rear sales location and are registered, they shall be stored by the owner at a fixed location or in a warehouse designated by the Committee, and the Committee may introduce them to banks for loans to facilitate turnover.

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Express Train Bombed Near Jianqiao, Heavily Damaged, Dozens of Passengers Injured and Killed</h3>
<p>According to Shewen News Agency, the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train left Hangzhou at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday. However, it was bombed by a landmine near Jianqiao. The explosion was deafening. The locomotive, baggage car, and one passenger car were bombed and heavily damaged. It is reported that dozens of passengers were injured and killed. After the Japanese military authorities learned about the bombing, they dispatched a team of Japanese soldiers to search near the scene of the incident, but no clues were found. At that time, the train tracks were destroyed, and the locomotive was damaged, so it took time to repair and remove them. The repair was completed around 11:00 PM the day before yesterday, and the express train started. It did not arrive in Shanghai until about 1:00 AM yesterday morning. The injured and killed passengers were handled by the Japanese side and the local authorities.</p>
<h3>Treatment Experience of Those Who Quit Opium Addiction</h3>
<p>Weiguang Hospital's first free opium addiction treatment program has been quite effective. Here are letters to the newspaper from Huang Huankui, Zai Yunsheng, and Zhang Yongpei, who received treatment: "To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao, we are writing to inform you that we have been addicted to opium for seven or eight years or more, due to illness or poor circumstances, and have been sinking into the black sea day and night, unable to extricate ourselves. Moreover, due to economic difficulties, we have become increasingly mired. This time, we happened to read your newspaper and learned that Mr. Wang Fen generously donated money and that your newspaper warmly introduced the Weiguang Hospital's meticulous treatment, especially the anti-drug special medicine "Andidu Jing" invented by Dr. Li Weiguang, which was injected for four days. Sure enough, we were no longer intoxicated or in pain. The opium addiction of many years has been completely eliminated, and the bad thoughts in our minds have also been completely swept away. It really restored our freedom and brought us to the other shore. We entered the hospital on May 1 and were discharged on May 7, only a week before and after. It was really like a completely different person. After that, we were clean, light, and happier than ever. Moved by this, we are writing out the facts of our experience to report it. If it can be published in your newspaper and tell fellow sufferers in the world, then the beneficiaries will not only be us. We hereby inform you and express our gratitude. Respectfully, Huang Huankui, Wang Yunsheng, and Zhang Yongpei, May 14."</p>
<h3>Sparse Flights, Restricted Airmail: Limited to Genuine Correspondence</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1666: Due to the scarcity of flights and limited capacity, all airmail forwarded from Hong Kong to the Southwest and Northwest regions is limited to genuine correspondence. Letters containing any other items or printed matter, regardless of quantity, will not be accepted as airmail to avoid hindering the delivery of genuine airmail. This unavoidable restriction requires public cooperation. Hereafter, airmail to the aforementioned regions must be posted at post office counters. If such letters are found to contain items other than correspondence after being deposited in mailboxes or letter slots, attempts will be made to return them to the sender or forward them via regular mail. This notice is hereby issued for general awareness.</p>
<h3>Beggars in Shelters: Release Upon Skill Acquisition, Contingent on Guaranteed Employment</h3>
<p>The beggar shelter established on Rochalie Drive in Singapore currently houses 1,400 male and female beggars, divided into workshops for shoemaking, mat weaving, sewing, and glove knitting. They are now well-behaved and no longer in their former vagrant state. Upon mastering a skill, those wishing to leave the shelter may be bailed out by shops, provided they guarantee employment and will not relapse into beggary. Currently, five beggars are still being sent to the shelter daily.</p>
<h3>Indian Shipping Leader, Van Ryckevorsel, Passes Through Shanghai: Claims External Reports of Japan's Situation Are Accurate; No Large-Scale Rebellion in India</h3>
<p>Van Ryckevorsel, an Indian shipping magnate, has completed his official business at the British Embassy in Tokyo and is returning to India aboard the President Garfield. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 14th). According to him, all news from within Japan is one-sided. He could not discuss the current state of Japan in detail, but he did say that most external reports about Japan are accurate. He left India more than two months ago to handle some work at the British Embassy in Tokyo, but he declined to disclose the precise nature of his trip. When asked about the situation in India, Van Ryckevorsel replied that any country that has not achieved independence feels dissatisfied, but there is absolutely no large-scale rebellion in India as rumored. These rumors are spread by some external party with the intention of sowing discord. Van Ryckevorsel also stated that he has no interest in disembarking in Shanghai because, apart from nightlife and entertainment venues, there is nothing worth seeing, so he does not want to waste his time.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Rice on Sale This Weekend: Limited to Two Dou Per Person; Half a Stone Per Family Per Week; Unlimited Sales When Supply Is Sufficient; First Batch of Government Rice Arrives Tomorrow at Same Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the Council has purchased 165,000 bags of rice from the Hong Kong government, of which approximately 60,000 bags have already arrived at the port and are being unloaded, with the remainder expected to arrive before the end of this month. Based on the average daily consumption of various types of rice in the International Settlement and the French Concession last year, the rice purchased by the Council is clearly sufficient to meet the needs of society once properly distributed.</p>
<p>Quantity of Sales Temporarily Restricted</p>
<p>The Council has now decided that until the supply of rice is sufficient to warrant unrestricted sales, the amount of rice sold by any store to each household, family, or group shall not exceed half a stone per week. Purchases are limited to those for personal consumption, until further notice. To implement the above decision, the quantity sold by stores to each individual at each transaction shall be limited to two dou (16 kilograms). The Council has already notified retail stores of the regulations and will task the police with close inspection to ensure strict compliance. The rice transported by the Council will be available for sale at retail rice shops in the International Settlement and the French Concession this weekend. The selling price is currently set at 110 yuan in national currency per full stone (80 kilograms). These stores must sell their original rice stock first; mixing with other grains is strictly prohibited. Anyone who discovers any violations of the above regulations regarding distribution, price, or quality of rice is urged to report it to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>Rice Already on the Wharf</p>
<p>Six thousand bags of Hong Kong rice transported to Shanghai by the Hanyang, Minsheng, Taiyuan, and Jiangsu vessels were unloaded overnight by laborers hired by Lap Kee &amp; Co. to expedite distribution to rice merchants. The unloading was completed by 5:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that some firms that ordered this Hong Kong rice went to pick up their goods yesterday. Lap Kee &amp; Co. has also delivered hundreds of small bags of rice samples to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Rice Merchants Association. It is claimed that the quality is excellent.</p>
<p>Pick-Up Today</p>
<p>According to Lap Kee &amp; Co. staff, rice firms and merchants will begin picking up their goods starting today in preparation for sale. According to staff at Cheung Mow &amp; Co., which handles Hong Kong rice collections, some rice merchants have not yet fully paid for their orders. Therefore, it is hoped that rice firms and merchants will pay early to pick up their rice as soon as possible. According to inquiries made by reporters at the rice market, Hong Kong rice is also already being sold in the market, mostly by grocery stores and rice shops that ordered it from Lap Kee &amp; Co. The price per bag is in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Council regulations, at 122.91 yuan. Some rice merchants buy it from the market due to operational convenience.</p>
<p>Second Batch to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Reporters at the Da Zhong News Agency learned from local shipping circles yesterday that after the arrival of the first batch of 6,000 bags of Hong Kong rice, the second batch will be partly carried by the Taikoo &amp; Co.'s Guangdong vessel arriving today, and partly by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yusheng vessel arriving in Shanghai on the 19th. The Minsheng vessel sailing to Hong Kong yesterday, the Hanyang vessel sailing to Hong Kong today, and the Taiyuan and Jiangsu vessels sailing to Hong Kong tomorrow will continue to load Hong Kong rice to Shanghai. It is estimated that the total number will reach 200,000 or 250,000 bags this month.</p>
<p>Ordering Locations</p>
<p>Currently, the only place to order low-priced Hong Kong rice is Lap Kee &amp; Co. at 220 Szechuan Road. If Hong Kong rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, Lap Kee &amp; Co. alone may be overwhelmed. Therefore, the concession authorities have also entrusted 17 other grocery stores, such as Tai Run, to assist Lap Kee &amp; Co. with the ordering process. The addresses of the 17 grocery stores are as follows: Tai Run, 22 Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street; Da Heng, 1 Lihe Lane, Route Doumer; Xie Mao, 79 Avenue Edward VII; Da Yuan, 9 Tong'an Lane, Yong'an Street; Tian Shen, 16 Xuyuan Lane, Shilu, Fourth Avenue; Yu Xing, 49 Taihe Lane, Route Paul Beau; Yi Feng, 110 Rue Pere Froc; Da Cheng, 39 Avenue Edward VII; Xie Chang, 208 Route des Soeurs; Cheng Shun Sheng, 4 Yong'an Street; Rui Chang Fa, 53 Renji Lane, Xinza Road; Run Tai Feng, inside the Lao Dongfang Hotel, Sanwei Road; Yi Xing Feng, 20 Jingfu Lane, 31 Shanxi Road; Heng Feng Tai, 20 Jinlong Street, Fifth Avenue; Chang Yi Heng, 229 Zhonghui Building; Zhen Xing, 29 Rue des Missionaires; Hong Xing, 122 Ningpo Road.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Orders Rice to Shanghai</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council, in order to suppress rice prices, has adopted the same approach as the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement, ordering a large quantity of rice from Saigon, totaling 50,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice. It is now learned that the first batch of 30,000 bags of government rice has been loaded onto a Norwegian merchant ship and is sailing to Shanghai, expected to arrive tomorrow (the 16th). The price has been determined to be the same as the standard price set by the International Settlement, not exceeding the limit of 110 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Cart Distribution</p>
<p>For the past three days, over a thousand rice cart workers have been on strike to protest rice merchants' refusal to hire them to haul rice. Because the dispute has not been resolved, the workers continued their strike yesterday. The coolie workers accepted the authorities' advice, so no accidents occurred yesterday. Trucks also continued to transport rice as usual. However, to prevent any unexpected events, the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered police detectives to pay close attention to rice transport and the security of rice warehouses. At 2:00 PM yesterday, representatives from all parties were summoned for mediation, including Fu Qian'geng from the Rice Merchants Association, Wang Fuyuan, Liu Shouming, and Xin Faming representing the striking workers, and Li Guozhu and Zhang Maocai representing the truck drivers. As a result of the mediation, the rice merchants deeply feared the continued occurrence of rice snatching incidents. The cart representatives stated that truck transport could not avoid robbery either. However, if preventive measures are implemented (installation of railings), this situation could be reduced. However, the truck representatives could not accept the rice being distributed by the carts and requested a change to a mutually beneficial solution. After repeated persuasion by the authorities, the opinions seemed to be slightly closer. The formal solution is still pending further discussion today. It is expected that the dispute will be resolved today.</p>
<p>Reasons for Child Abandonment</p>
<p>According to the Pu Shan Cemetery, the rice price surge in October reached its peak, causing a sharp increase in civilian deaths from the high rice prices. As a result, the number of corpses collected and buried by the cemetery increased sharply last month, totaling 802 adult bodies, 1,139 child bodies, and 1,466 infant bodies. Among the infant bodies, some were still breathing, as their parents had no choice but to abandon them due to the threat of rice prices, in order to reduce the number of mouths to feed. The scene was so tragic it was unbearable to imagine.</p>
<p>Tea Coolie Steals Check</p>
<p>Withdraws Over 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Chengli, a tea coolie from Cheng Chang Transport Company on Guangdong Road, stole a check, signed and stamped it, and fraudulently withdrew over 11,000 yuan before fleeing. He was arrested by the Central Police Station and taken to the First Special Court yesterday morning, where Judge Feng ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>German Pilots Arrested En Route to Shanghai on President Garfield; Intercepted and Searched by British Ship; Four Arrested; Allegedly Under Orders to Go to Japan to Serve as Instructors</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, the latest round-the-world liner of the American President Lines, the President Garfield, arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 14th). According to crew members, the ship was intercepted near Honolulu by the British auxiliary cruiser HMS Prince Robert. Several British naval officers and soldiers boarded the President Garfield and arrested four German pilots on board. The four pilots were believed to have escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Canada. When arrested, two of them were weeping bitterly. They claimed that they had been ordered in San Francisco to go to Japan to train Japanese pilots.</p>
<h3>Retirement of Head of the French Concession's Public Works Department, L'Oyrette; Inspects Troops Yesterday at Gu Kaizhi Park; French Consul General, Magre, Presents Medal</h3>
<p>Captain L'Oyrette, the head of the Public Works Department of the French Concession, who has served in that association for nearly twenty-one years, is scheduled to retire from his post on the 15th of this month. The entire fire department held an inspection at Gu Kaizhi Park at 8:30 AM yesterday (the 14th). After French Consul General Magre, accompanied by L'Oyrette, completed the inspection, Magre delivered a speech praising the fire department's excellent work and expressing regret at L'Oyrette's retirement. At the end of his speech, he presented a medal to L'Oyrette in recognition of his leadership of the fire department. It is rumored that Lieutenant Bossu, who has assisted L'Oyrette for many years, may succeed L'Oyrette's vacant position. L'Oyrette completed his military service and came to Shanghai in 1920, subsequently joining the fire department. Now, upon his retirement, he is unable to return to Europe due to the unstable situation there, so he will temporarily remain in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Dancer and Manager Resolved; No Legal Issues Arose</h3>
<p>Wang Xiarong, a local dancer, was dancing at the Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Edward VII. The other night, she drank heavily with dance patrons, causing her to become drunk and create a disturbance in the venue. Chen Fuzhi, the manager of the ballroom, stepped forward to dissuade her, resulting in a conflict. The two nearly came to blows but were separated by people present at the scene. Wang Xiarong suffered minor injuries and went to Pao Lung Hospital for treatment. She only suffered superficial skin injuries, and after applying medicine and bandages, she was able to leave the hospital. Rumors of legal issues arising from this and Chen Fuzhi fleeing in response are not true. The case has been resolved through mediation by friends of both parties.</p>

They smashed a large-scale morphine operation in the house and seized a large bag of morphine (weighing over one catty), a bag of heroin (weighing one catty and three taels), 8,100 yuan in cash, 140 yuan in banknotes, and 60 yuan in Japanese currency from a secret compartment on the second floor. The value of the drugs was enormous. Xia Yaoting, a Taixing native (41 years old), who was guarding the operation, was arrested, along with evidence, and taken to the French police station for strict interrogation. According to Xia's confession, the drug operation was opened by Chaozhou natives Li Hongsheng, Zhou Shouhua, the manager of the Donghua Hotel on Sanma Road in the International Settlement, and others named Zhu Xiaojiang and Cai Xiaokai. The French police, based on the confession, dispatched detectives to capture the aforementioned criminals at their locations. However, the criminals had already received the news and fled without a trace. The police department has ordered a strict search for the criminals, to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Zhao Wenhua, a 40-year-old Jiangsu native and rickshaw puller residing at 691 Route Doumer, went out to pull his rickshaw on the morning of the 13th. At 11:30 AM, he went to Xu Jianxing's food stall (an Anhui native) at the intersection of Route Francis Garnier and Route Paul Beau to have lunch. A verbal dispute arose between him and Yu Jianliang (21 years old), a worker at the food stall, due to teasing and joking. The dispute escalated into a fistfight, with both sides punching and kicking each other violently. People persuaded them to stop, and they dispersed. Zhao then pulled his rickshaw home, but because he had been assaulted after having a full meal, his stomach was injured and in pain. He went to bed but did not recover. By 11:00 AM yesterday, Zhao's condition had worsened. His family reported it to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. Zhao was sent to St. Luc Hospital, but he died within half an hour due to the severe damage to his internal organs.

<h3>Numerous Abuses in Redemption Pawnshop Business; Difficulties in Tracing Stolen Goods; Resale Obstructs Criminal Investigations; Someone Actually Buys Over a Thousand Pawn Tickets</h3>
<p>Chen Guisen, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Police Station, recently arrested a thief who confessed that the stolen goods had been pawned and that the pawn tickets had been sold to Feng Zenggao, a Shaoxing native who operates a pawnshop redemption service at No. 11, Lane 262, Beishan Road. The detective then arrested Feng and seized 1,228 pawn tickets that he had collected. This morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Court. Police attorney Qian Yijiu stated that this practice of redeeming pawn tickets for customers can affect the police's investigation of criminal cases because the pawn tickets are resold, making it difficult for the police to trace stolen goods. The large number of pawn tickets seized from the defendant must include stolen goods from theft cases. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the hearing for investigation. Judge Dai核he reported to the magistrate, who ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>
<h3>Apostle of Christ</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>It was a Sunday morning, and the beautiful sun urged me to get up early. I was proofreading a manuscript at my desk when suddenly I heard the sound of someone tapping on the door with their fingers. To my surprise, I found a Westerner of medium height standing at the door of the study. When he saw that I had noticed him, he walked straight to my desk without hesitation, forcing me to ask him in broken English what he wanted. He quickly showed me a red card encased in a soft glass cover, and I realized that he was carrying out the mission of Jesus Christ, coming to promote Christian books. He immediately took out two rather thick hardcover books from his large, old leather briefcase, and placed them respectfully in front of me, asking me to appreciate them. He said that the content of the books was so good that reading them would bring me many benefits, implying that I should buy his books.</p>
<p>I found that his English was not very pleasant to listen to. His clothes matched the identity of an apostle of Jesus Christ. Medium height, round face, with a tragic shadow hidden deep in his green, sunken eye sockets. I didn't need to ask him; I had already guessed his background.</p>
<p>Both of these books were written by J.F. Rutherford and published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society at 731 Heath Road. One book was called "Riches" and the other was called "Enemies." He quickly turned to page fourteen of "Enemies" and pointed it out to me -</p>
<p>"After the World War, a zealous Hitler was embraced as the ultimate dictator and leader of the Nazi Party in Germany... Thus, the democratic politics of Germany came to an end... The Nazi Party under Hitler's rule, fearing the loss of power, continued to use cruel means to exercise its rule, killing or imprisoning those who did not openly support them. The people suffered because their material wealth had been plundered, their freedom and lives were threatened, and they were in extreme distress and panic."</p>
<p>This passage seemed to be written for him and others who had suffered the same fate. He pointed out this passage to me, perhaps wanting me to sympathize with him. I asked him if he was Jewish, and he said he was German; actually, he should be a German Jew. I felt that he didn't seem very honest.</p>
<p>"I don't want these books because I'm not a Christian." I flipped through a few pages and pushed the books back to him.</p>
<p>"The content of these books is very valuable, the printing is so exquisite, and each book only costs one yuan, which is so cheap; you have so many books on your desk, you should also buy these two books, which will bring you more benefits." Seeing many books piled on my desk, he insisted on praising his books to prompt me to buy them. On the other hand, he took out many thin booklets.</p>
<p>"Because I'm not a Christian, I don't want to read these books." My attitude was still very firm.</p>
<p>"You only need to smoke one less pack of cigarettes, take one less photo, and you can buy these books!" Seeing that I was smoking a cigarette and at the same time touching the photo under the glass panel, he said to me with a reproachful tone: "These are of no benefit to you!"</p>
<p>I was a little annoyed, but I still patiently said: "Photos are for me to appreciate and keep as a souvenir; cigarettes are enough to increase my work efficiency; how can they be of no benefit to me? I don't want to buy your books. Do you want to smoke?" I handed him a cigarette, but he didn't accept it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an inexplicable thought appeared in my mind: Why don't I buy his books? Not to mention God, from a humanitarian standpoint, why can't I sympathize with him? My will had already wavered. I realized that he had been standing next to me for more than ten minutes, which seemed like I was being a bit cruel to him, so I asked him to sit down on the chair opposite my desk. He was overjoyed and sat very respectfully and solemnly opposite me with the usual Chinese politeness, a satisfied smile floating on his face.</p>
<p>Due to my detailed questioning, he told me that he had come to Shanghai a year and a half ago, had no job, and was selling these books for the church, which subsidized some of his living expenses. Due to the compassion that God has given to mankind, and due to the spirit of charity and mutual assistance praised by Jesus Christ, I finally bought these two books. When he got to the alley, he was driven out by the patrolmen. I imagine he gets driven out by many people every day.</p>
<p>Because the Nazis plundered their wealth, their freedom and lives were threatened, and they had to flee to the free city of Shanghai, so this "paradise" has added this group of "adventurers" who are fleeing for their lives.</p>
<h3>"Touching the Nasal Membrane" Amazing Technique Dr. Wei Dan Lowers Consultation Fees to Favor Chinese</h3>
<p>In order for Chinese patients to enjoy his divine medical treatment, Dr. Wei Dan has specifically offered preferential consultation fees, so as to avoid disappointment and to spread the wonderful art of rejuvenation throughout the world. However, Dr. Wei Dan's new "Touching the Nasal Membrane" technique is not a cure for all diseases, and is only limited to the following conditions, so please pay attention.</p>
<p>(1) Asthma: This is a stubborn disease. Patients often become discouraged and disappointed, but after one application of this technique, the disease seems to disappear. Moreover, in some cases, the wheezing is greatly reduced or completely eliminated at the end of the procedure.</p>
<p>As for hay fever, which often causes sneezing, and chronic nasal colds with constant runny nose, this technique is also very effective in treating them.</p>
<p>(2) Nervous System Diseases: Headaches, dizziness, tremors, insomnia, etc., can be cured with several treatments. Those suffering from neurasthenia, who have lost control of their reason, are inexplicably depressed, and have unpredictable mood swings, will feel refreshed and restored to normal after treatment. At the same time, Dr. Wei Dan is also effective in treating those with mental illness. Those suffering from this often suddenly lose their conscience and have convulsive movements, which were previously considered incurable, but now there is a way to save them. Since Dr. Wei Dan arrived in Shanghai, he has treated many people with this disease. Dr. Wei Dan can also treat hemiplegia and Parkinson's disease, in which the muscles are stiff and the hands tremble.</p>
<p>As for paralysis, other doctors are helpless, considering it untreatable, and patients have also given up hope. Fortunately, they are cured by Dr. Wei Dan's divine technique, and many have regained normal movement of their limbs.</p>
<p>(3) Digestive System Diseases: Stomach pain, vomiting stomach acid, constipation, etc. are all treated.</p>
<p>(4) Pain: All kinds of pain, including rheumatism, stomach pain, back pain, etc., are all eliminated after treatment with the new "Touching the Nasal Membrane" technique.</p>
<p>(5) Delayed Development in Children: Delayed physical and mental development in children, resulting in unsteady movements and hesitant speech, is all caused by restlessness. Furthermore, those with nervous sensitivity can restore normal after one "Touching the Nasal Membrane" treatment.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the above results can be achieved with only a small golden stick touching the nasal membrane, which can produce miraculous effects, which everyone considers a divine technique. However, Dr. Wei Dan does not boast of wonders, but takes pure science as his stance. He deeply knows that the hub that manages our health, the so-called "vagus nerve," is concentrated between the nasal mucous membranes, and once touched by Dr. Wei Dan's technique, it is immediately stimulated. His technique is actually based on the same principle as acupuncture, which has been used in China for thousands of years, stimulating various acupoints on the human body.</p>
<p>For the sake of prudence, Dr. Wei Dan must examine the patient before determining whether his technique is suitable. He does not rashly proceed with a treatment unless he is very confident that it will be effective. Therefore, the initial examination is free of charge, and patients are free to choose whether or not to receive treatment, which shows Dr. Wei Dan's benevolence and skill.</p>
<p>Those who wish to inquire can come to Room 707 of the Hua Pan Hotel on the Bund from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily (closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays).</p>

<h3>Educational Inspector Talks About the Recent Situation of Education in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong.  Fujian's Educational Administration is Organized and Systematic.  Students in Zhejiang Province Seek Progress Through Hardship. Guangdong's Educational Director Is Seriously Rectifying and Making Progress</h3>
<p>(Yong'an Correspondence) Wang Dexi, an inspector of the Ministry of Education, was sent to Fujian in mid-May of last year to inspect secondary education in Fujian Province. Mr. Wang arrived in Yong'an on June 2nd of last year and completed his inspection mission at the end of September last year, lasting a total of four months. He was then ordered to continue inspecting secondary education in Zhejiang Province, starting in early October and completing the inspection at the end of January this year. In February of this year, he was again ordered to go to Guangdong and Guangxi for inspection, starting in mid-February from Nanxiong and Shixing in northern Guangdong, passing through Qujiang and traveling along the Dongjiang, Xingning, Meixian, and Dapu areas. Recently, at the invitation of Zheng, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, he was invited to Yong'an to participate in a lecture at the training session for principals of secondary schools in Fujian Province. He immediately transferred to Yong'an and participated in the graduation ceremony of the training session on April 15th. He left Yong'an on April 17th to go to Guangdong and then to Guangxi for inspection. He is expected to return to the Ministry to report in late June. The reporter interviewed Mr. Wang at his residence and inquired about the educational situation in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. He replied as follows: I was ordered by the Ministry to inspect education in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong for a total of one year. The educational situations in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces each have their strengths and weaknesses. In terms of Fujian, although the educational environment in Fujian is not as close to the war zone as other provinces and is relatively peaceful and unimpeded, the educational foundation has been weak in the past due to political turmoil. It is quite commendable that it can still develop daily on this weak foundation. Its advantages are: (1) the educational administration is organized and systematic, (2) the educational funds are stable and can be disbursed on time, (3) the inspection system is strict, (4) the equipment of each school is very suitable for wartime requirements, and (5) the educational progress is unmatched by neighboring provinces. The vigorous spirit of the members of this secondary school principal training session is admirable. In terms of education in Zhejiang Province, the cultural level of the province has surpassed other provinces in the past, and in theory, the progress of education should be faster than in Fujian Province. However, since the rich areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou were occupied by the Japanese, the administrative relations are complex due to being close to the war zone, and there are many difficulties in implementation, so the progress is not as good as in Fujian Province. Fortunately, the educational foundation of the province in the past was very strong, and all teachers and students can seek progress through hard work and struggle. Education in the province is quite universal, which is a special advantage of the province. In terms of Guangdong Province, its educational environment is the same as Zhejiang Province, and the implementation is hindered due to being close to the war zone. Its foundation is not as good as that of Zhejiang Province, and the quality is poor. However, the Educational Director Huang of the province has been seriously rectifying for two years, and it has also made progress.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Higher Education for Middle School Graduates (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chuanjia</p>
<p>Which university is most suitable for a middle school graduate to apply to? Of course, everyone has their own perspective. Some like public universities, some like private universities, or those run by churches. Some are willing to take exams for schools in Shanghai, Beiping, and Hong Kong, while others don't mind a long journey to Kunming, Sichuan, or Fujian. Publicly funded institutions naturally have sufficient funds, complete equipment, many departments, and concentrated talent. However, private institutions are often more serious about teaching because of their smaller scope, and the feelings between teachers and students are relatively strong. There are also many Taoist schools. In short, I think there are at least the following criteria for choosing a university: (1st) Choose a school that suits your interests, (2nd) What is the history and social reputation of the school you choose? (3rd) What is the reputation of the school authorities and professors? (4th) Is the equipment of the school you choose, especially the library, science, and sports equipment, complete? Other issues such as funding, transportation, and career prospects should also be listed as the final criteria.

<h3>Hess's "Paranoia"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>The sudden flight of Hess, a key figure in Germany, to England by plane has taken the world by surprise. Although it was a solo act, given his position, it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future of the global situation.</p>
<p>Following the incident, the German side initially claimed that Hess had "committed suicide," and then said that Hess suffered from "mental disorder" and had symptoms of "paranoia." "Suicide" requires factual proof, while "mental disorder" is easier to gloss over, so saying Hess had a "mental disorder" is obviously much smarter.</p>
<p>However, according to books on psychiatry, there are many types of "paranoia." Even the superstitions of African natives can be considered as "paranoia," but this kind of "paranoia" cannot be said to be a mental disorder.</p>
<p>True paranoia can be divided into the following types: (1) persecutory paranoia, (2) suspicious paranoia, (3) depressive paranoia, (4) grandiose paranoia, (5) sexual paranoia, (6) religious mania, (7) personality paranoia. If Hess has so-called paranoia, then it should belong to the first type. But if his views are based on facts, they cannot be said to be "paranoia."</p>
<p>As for saying Hess is "paranoid about being friendly with England," if this is really "paranoia," then it should be equated to the superstitions of African natives, and cannot be said to be a "mental disorder."</p>
<p>Career</p>
<h3>I Am a Female Worker</h3>
<p>— Su Cao</p>
<p>I am a female worker. I work in a factory, earning a meager wage with a large amount of labor. The difficulties and hardships of life are imaginable. But who knows that there is even greater suffering in our lives!</p>
<p>The "Namo Wen" (foreman) possesses a kind of latent power: the "gentlemen"—the workers all call the staff "gentlemen"—almost listen and obey her; and we workers can only obey her orders. In order to win her favor, we have to curry favor with her, otherwise, she will say bad things about you in front of the "gentleman," causing the "gentleman" to punish you, and fire you. Therefore, in our monthly income, we have to economize in every possible way, extracting a portion of our blood and sweat as "social expenses" to maintain contact with her.</p>
<p>There are indeed many good "gentlemen," but there are also quite a few scoundrels. They often harbor despicable "intentions" towards young and relatively pretty female workers: they come to flirt at any opportunity. Unreasonable teasing is commonplace, and sometimes they even invite you to restaurants. To watch movies, visit parks..., if you sternly refuse, then they will use their positions to take shameless revenge: either nitpicking to deduct your wages; or reducing your wages; or making a fuss over a minor issue, scolding you in public, leaving you with nowhere to stand; they may even fabricate false charges against you...</p>
<p>There was a gentleman who was indeed very sympathetic to me, a young widow. He gave me a small amount of help, both spiritual and material: he knew that my monthly income had to support a family of three—I also have a mother-in-law and a child—which was very difficult, so every time he calculated my wages, he always added a little more; whenever there was extra work during the festival, he always assigned it to me so that I could earn more money. His treatment of me made me feel unspeakable gratitude. Who knew that this gentleman with a benevolent appearance actually harbored the heart of a snake. Gradually, the fox revealed its tail. It turned out that he also had despicable intentions towards me. When I expressed my refusal, he began to feel disappointed, and then shameless revenge was added heavily on me. I have no other way to resist, only to intensify my efforts in my own work. However, this resistance is too weak. Penalties for wage deductions and demerits are constantly pressuring me to surrender. Fortunately, my work performance is carefully calculated to be in the top tier, and many other gentlemen in the factory still know my performance, so he still cannot use trivial matters to fire me, leaving me with nothing to eat. However, in the past year, I have seen many new workers whose wages have increased time and time again, and each one of them has exceeded mine.</p>
<p>Exchanging extreme labor for extremely low wages and still not being able to live steadily, what is the reason for this? I think: perhaps this is my "fate"?</p>

<h3>Can Sleep Be Eliminated?</h3>
<p>— Lini</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing in everyone's life is that sleep takes up at least one-third of it. It can be said that there is absolutely no one in the world who doesn't sleep. At most, there is a difference between sleeping more or sleeping less! Throughout history, medical scientists have often believed that sleep is necessary for human beings because it can restore tired bodies and minds. But is this view absolutely correct? If we further explore what the purpose of sleep really is, it may not be an uninteresting thing to do.</p>
<p>Professor Fred A. Mass, director of the psychology department at George Washington University in the United States, ordered four male and female students to stay awake for sixty hours. The results of the observation showed that sleep is a habit, and its state is similar to drunkenness. When the experiment ended, although the students felt very tired, their health was not affected at all. Professor Morse even wanted to determine the efficiency of work for insomniacs, so he ordered each person to drive a car after being awake for fifty hours. As a result, the work did not lose its effectiveness. Professor Morse himself only sleeps six hours a night, and his work spirit is not diminished at all.</p>
<p>Among the scientists studying the secrets of sleep, Columbia University psychology professor Dr. H. L. Holliwonrth) also made startling remarks, saying that in the future, human beings will develop and may become a "non-sleeping race." He advocated gradually reducing sleep time, and over time, it may be possible to not sleep at all. For example, reduce sleep by five minutes every two months. If you currently sleep eight hours, after sixteen years, you can completely not sleep. Professor Huo believes that sleep is a tragedy and can be regarded as other diseases. Professor Huo said that sleep is actually inherited from ancestors because in ancient times. Human knowledge was immature. After sunset, darkness followed, and it was impossible to continue activities. Since there was nothing to do, they naturally fell asleep to await the return of daylight. Later, it became a habit, passed down to their children and grandchildren, and became indispensable!</p>
<p>In addition, many scientists believe that sleep is a human habit, such as the experiment of Dr. Craven of the University of Chicago, which also proves that sleep can be completely abolished, or at least reduced to a certain minimum limit. Dr. Ke once napped for five days and four nights, a full one hundred and fifteen hours, and found that as long as the muscles were contracted as usual, it could drive away sleep. In addition, famous scientists Dr. Frazer Harris and Dr. AW. Crile, and Professor Arthur Cotton have all devoted themselves to studying methods to replace sleep. Professor Ge believes that sleep is due to the reaction of electrochemical action in brain cells. If an electrical machine can be invented to directly restore the activity of tired brain cells, then sleep will not be needed!</p>
<p>In short, regardless of whether sleep is one of our habits or a real need, it is a great pity that a person's life is occupied by it for one-third of the time. Great figures in ancient and modern times often slept very little. Edison's lack of sleep is well known. In addition, great heroes such as Napoleon, the German hero Frederick the Great, and the German poet Schiller, and the Italian writer Tassona, etc., were satisfied with only three to five hours of sleep each day. It can be seen that their achievements are not accidental.</p>
<p>Life is at most a hundred years, but one-third of the precious time is taken up by sleep. What a sad thing this is! No wonder scientists are trying to find a way to replace sleep!</p>
<p>But what is even more pitiful is that some people have already spent one-third of their time sleeping, and they let the other two-thirds of their time slip away in a daze. All of these people's lives are actually wasted! Therefore, before there is a method to replace sleep, in order to save time and rescue life, one should immediately intensify work quickly while awake!</p>

<h3>Pedicab Driver</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the European war, Denmark is experiencing a severe shortage of gasoline, and private cars can no longer be driven. Wealthy merchants have come up with the whimsical idea of using tandem bicycles and hiring pedicab drivers to replace cars as a means of transportation. There were originally 1.75 million bicycles in the Danish capital, which has now suddenly increased to 3.8 million, it is said. This is also an interesting anecdote amid the sounds of the European war.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Tangible Friendship</p>
<p>"But how can I be a human being in the future?" Before he could finish speaking, Begonia groaned like this.</p>
<p>Shaowen immediately sat down on the edge of his bed.</p>
<p>"Old brother, everything in the future is up to me!" He grabbed Begonia's eyebrows tightly and said, "Anyway, you didn't really want to act in operas. Don't act anymore in the future! As for that dog talent Ji Zhaoxiong? You watch: I will never let him go no matter what! At the very least, I can't let him live happier than you!"</p>
<p>When he said the last two sentences, there was a very clear indication in his voice, which made Begonia know that he would definitely put it into practice soon.</p>
<p>Begonia was not an unreasonable person in the first place, and Shaowen's explanation to him was so detailed and kind, of course he could no longer make things difficult for his good friend of many years.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, when Shaowen went to the hospital to see him again, he met the chief surgeon in the corridor.</p>
<p>"Your younger brother's wound will probably not fester again."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "It's just that he can't sleep well, as if he has a lot on his mind; it's not good for us to give him sleeping pills often, this has a great impact on the wound and the body. It's best if you can persuade him!"</p>
<p>However, this point was not something Shaowen could persuade, and he only expected half of Begonia's thoughts: in his thoughts, Begonia was always remembering Luo Xiangqi, but he did not know that he still had an even bigger concern—that was his sick daughter. (106)</p>

<h3>A Page of Blood and Tears in the History of Yue Opera</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>I once read "Weitan" written by Zhu Zhishan of the Ming Dynasty, which said: "The branch of Kunqu Opera, passed down from the Song and Yuan dynasties to the Ming Dynasty, is divided into two types: manchuo and stringed music. The ancient sounds are gradually lost. Those that spread to the north are called Yiyang tune, Gaoyang tune, etc., mixed with the sounds of the northern Yan. Those that spread into Han are called Congyang tune, and those that spread into Huguang are called Xiangyang tune." Zhishan was a Ming Dynasty person, and what he said was the actual situation at the time. Therefore, those who talk about the spread of drama today, whether it is Peking Opera, Cantonese Opera, or local operas in various places, it can all be said that they evolved from the Kunqu Opera of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. As for which came first and which came later, the records of drama figures, both public and private, are slightly different, and it is not possible to make arbitrary speculations.</p>
<p>Recently, this journal published an article by Mr. Gu Mei on Peking Opera and Shaoxing Opera, stating that Shaoxing Opera evolved from the Southern Opera after the Anning of the Southern Song Dynasty. His meaning seems to coincide with the above. The author once heard it from Qian Junyun, an old musician of our county who has passed away. "Yue Opera originated in the late Ming Dynasty. At that time, there was peace for a long time. The members of the imperial family stationed in various prefectures lived in luxury, with abundant food and clothing, and had nothing to do. They spent their days with silk and bamboo music, and sensual pleasures. When the Ming Dynasty collapsed, those who were once so-called golden branches and jade leaves and carefree all turned into prisoners. Those stationed in prefectures were uniquely spared because they usually immersed themselves in drama, were proficient in music, understood singing, and had no lofty ambitions. However, they were ordered to have men permanently be horn blowers and women permanently be wedding singers. That is what they bought as "fallen people"! This group was forbidden to marry people of other surnames, and they were not allowed to study or participate in the annual examinations. The path to becoming an official was cut off, so they had to seek a living in the opera that they had become addicted to on weekdays. Thus, Yue Opera became very popular. The current Shaoxing Opera is actually its advanced form. In the beginning, the descendants of the imperial family stationed in the Yue area were very attached to each other. They lived separately for many years. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, they feared being exterminated, so many changed their surnames to seek survival. When the pardon decree was issued, many still did not dare to publicly state their real surnames. Therefore, the surnames of the "fallen people" were very mixed. As time went by, even their descendants knew very little about it." Therefore, the development process of Yue Opera does contain a page of national blood and tears history. Recording it is also to mourn the ancients and lament the present!</p>
<h3>Ba Yu Comes to Say Box Office</h3>
<p>— Ruoqi</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Xiaohong has served in the postal service for many years. He plays opera in his spare time and follows the Wanhua style. He is one of the famous Qingyi amateur actors of the Shanghai school. Since entering Chongqing last year, he has been honored to hold a position in the aviation industry. Old friends have been separated for a long time, and he is deeply missed. Unexpectedly, a letter arrived yesterday afternoon, describing the situation of the local amateur opera circle in great detail. Therefore, the letter is published to the entertainment industry, so that enthusiasts in Shanghai can know a glimpse of the amateur opera circle in the accompanying capital.</p>
<p>"The amateur opera circle in Chongqing is very active. Over the past six months, charity performances have never stopped. The number of amateur actors is no less than in Shanghai. Among them, the most popular ones are: with the roles of Yang Wannong, Rong Boming, and Wang Zhenzu, with the roles of male characters Zou Gongfu, Zhang Fenglou, with the roles of martial arts actors Zhang Quan, Zhou Zhibin, with the roles of young male characters Wang Zhenou, and with the roles of Jing characters Tie Zheng. The piano players are Zhou Zhenfang, Guo Yunzhi, Gao Yinlv, and Qiao Junfu. I am already familiar with most of the amateur actors, and I go to listen to every performance, which is very enjoyable. Wannong's voice is enviable. I have seen her perform "Life and Death Hate," "Wujia Slope," "Spring and Autumn Match," "Battle of Puguan," and "Sitting in the Palace," etc. Her voice is consistent from beginning to end, and her makeup is also absolutely flawless, only her body is slightly inferior. Wang Zhenzu, the owner of Xiaoyun Pavilion, has only appeared once here, performing the complete "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest." His singing and acting are excellent, but his makeup is too old. Except for the Yuanban and Liushui tunes, the rest of his slow-paced Nanbangzi, etc., are not the original tunes of Mei Wang. As for his costumes, curtains, etc., everything is fully prepared, and the scale is rare in the amateur opera circle. There are also many better amateur opera groups in Chongqing, such as the Chinese Opera Group of the New Transport Agency of the Ministry of Communications, the Hengshe Chongqing Branch, the Yage Collection Travel Chongqing Branch (sponsored by Zhu Lianfu), the Zhengfengshe Amateur Friendship Society, and the Chrysanthemum Society Chongqing Branch. After I came to Chongqing, I have appeared in "Baolian Lantern" twice, "Wujia Slope," "Battle of Puguan," and "Visiting Mother" several times. The airline originally had the Tongren Opera Group in its spare time, which has now been changed to the China Aviation Branch Chinese Opera Group of the New Transport Coordination Association of Transportation Employees. I have been appointed as the drama director. This can be said to be 'Liao Hua filling the role of a vanguard in the absence of a great general.'"</p>
<h3>Luo Ke Returns to the Screen</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Luo Ke, the comedic genius who was once as famous as Chaplin, has been absent from the silver screen for a long time since the film "Professor Beware"; during this period, although we have not been able to see his style on the screen, according to news reports, Luo Ke was responsible for directing a film, titled "A Man, A Girl, A Gob."</p>
<p>Recently, Luo Ke has the intention to return to the film industry, and it is said that his first new work has been determined to be "My FoVourite Spy"; Luo Ke's return to the silver screen will be unanimously welcomed by all sectors, but we hope that Luo Ke can take good care of himself, otherwise he will ruin his future and will be ridiculed by the world.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Movie City</h3>
<p>— Zhaoji</p>
<p>Recently, Hollywood rumors that George Brent and the girl Ann Sheridan have been married in Mexico, but they both immediately made statements denying it. In fact, George Brent has had a lot of romantic news. Last year, it was rumored that he was getting hot with Bette Davis, and recently it was rumored that he was having a big romance with the mysterious girl Garha, but now he is indeed closest to Garbo and Sheridan.</p>
<p>Marx Freud, a Hollywood makeup artist, believes that the beauty and charm of female stars do not diminish with age, and are even more eye-catching than when they were younger. He personally pointed out that Irene Dunne, Garson, Margaret Sullavan, Joan Crawford, and Nauma Shearer are all like this. These female stars are all over thirty years old. Marx believes that women around twenty years old are most likely to express their youthfulness.</p>
<p>Since being affected by the European war, the market for American films has shrunk, so they have flocked to develop in South America. South Americans like to watch films starring Errol Flynn and James Cagney, and their favorite female star is Bette Davis, who was recently elected as the film queen by a South American film publication.</p>
<p>Since its reorganization a few years ago, Universal Pictures has made rapid progress in all aspects. Not long ago, Sithman, the company's vice president, announced this year's film production plan, which includes Diana Durban's new film. Irene Dunne and Carol Slaughton have one each. Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan, and Margaret Sullavan and Philantong each have one co-starring film. Carol Landis, George Raft, Loretta Teti, and Marlene Dietrich also each have a new film.</p>
<h3>Song Yanei's Life After Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ruyong</p>
<p>This column has previously reported a lot about Diana Durban's marriage and various things after marriage. Here I will tell you a little about the news of "Skating Queen" Song Ya Hainei's marriage to New York's young rich man Tan Tuoping, and Song Ya Hainei's future career.</p>
<p>Their wedding date was July 4 last year. Whether she would continue to make films after her marriage, and the news of Diana Durban's marriage to Feng Baoluo, were all of great concern to movie fans. Song Ya Hainei herself replied to this question: "There are quite a few people outside who think that after I marry Tan Tuoping, I will withdraw from the film industry. In fact, this is not true. Maybe I will have this intention in the future, but at least in the near future, I will not leave the film industry and the skating business. My career is currently going very smoothly. If my work is not satisfactory, then I will not stay in the film industry." Of course, what she said about being unsatisfactory is her box office appeal.</p>
<p>Now that she has a stable and happy family life, of course she no longer needs to show her beauty again. So as we see it, it is probably impossible for Song Ya Hainei to re-enter the film industry.</p>

<h3>Blood Two Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: I Pity You, Why Have You Come to the Ends of the Earth?</p>
<p>After saying that, he put on the Scarlet Phoenix Sword and packed his luggage, quietly walked out of the Wang family gate, stepped onto the avenue, and walked out of the city gate step by step. He had no fixed destination in his mind, only cared about walking towards remote places, gradually leaving the bustling area and reaching the mountains and fields. It was already near the hot summer, and the scorching sun was like fire, making him sweat all over. Seeing two elm trees by the roadside, with thick shade covering the ground, just a good place to cool off, he put down his burden under the elm trees and sat on the ground. Sure enough, two cool breezes blew, making his spirit refreshed. He lowered his head and thought about how this time he had left his hometown and come here, only wanting to take advantage of the chaotic times to establish some fame. Wang Yongtai was his father's friend and a senior hero. Getting him to promote him in front of General Zhou was a good opportunity, who knew that such an unexpected fork in the road would arise out of thin air? That demon concubine was extremely venomous, and when her seduction of me failed, she immediately came up with a poisonous conspiracy, speaking ill of me in front of Wang Yongtai, driving me away, and from then on, she and the one surnamed Sang could be unscrupulous, not afraid of others revealing their secrets. I shouldn't say how Wang Yongtai was so old and confused, listening to a woman's words, and actually issuing an order to evict guests, so the ancients said that only women and villains are difficult to raise. Immersed words, skin accusations, even for parents, they would change their minds, let alone for the son of an old friend? Naturally, he easily believed her eloquent words. But I, Xu Jing, am a good man who stands upright. Suffering such a unjust grievance, how can I just walk away? No matter what, I must make Wang Yongtai thoroughly understand the truth, and regret his mistake, and also remove his future hidden dangers. Moreover, I am grateful to General Zhou Yuji for employing me, if I abandon him and leave, where else would I meet such a good general? So I cannot leave Daizhou. Then where should I go to find a place to stay outside the city gate? Stay in an inn? My wallet is shy, and I don't have enough food for a few days. Go to General Zhou Yuji's office? Because of Wang Yongtai's relationship, I should also temporarily not meet him, so as not to embarrass Wang Yongtai. It would be best to have a Zen temple where I can temporarily stay, so I should go to the mountains to look for it. So he sat for a while, stood up, carried his package, and went into the mountains. The mountain path was winding and tortuous, and the scenery was very secluded. Xu Jing was single-mindedly looking for a Zen temple, but there were very few residents in the mountains, and he could not find it for a long time. Just now, after walking over a ridge, a fierce wolf suddenly窜 out from a pine forest by the roadside. Xu Jing knew that this animal was going to bite people, and hurriedly put down his package, pulled out his Scarlet Phoenix Sword, and prepared to defend himself. When the wolf saw a stranger, it really pounced fiercely towards Xu Jing. Xu Jing shouted, "Evil beast, how dare you hurt people!" and waved his sword, stabbing the wolf. One person and one wolf fought fiercely under the ridge. Suddenly, a dart flew out of thin air, hitting the wolf's neck with a clang. The wolf howled and immediately fell to the ground in the grass. Xu Jing lowered his head to take a closer look, and the dart had pierced through the wolf's throat, shooting a hole, and blood was flowing all over the ground. The wolf died. (63)</p>
<h3>A Summary of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Giving up oneself and belittling oneself are different. Oneself is a useful tool. When it is time to use it, in the place where it should be used, one should generously use it. This is giving up oneself. Squandering it casually and not cherishing it at all is belittling oneself. For the sake of society and the country, if I have a point of heat, I will release a point of light. This is being good at giving up oneself!</p>
