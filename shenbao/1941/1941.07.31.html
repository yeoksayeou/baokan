<h3 id="c8">遠東局勢前途的透視 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>隨着美英凍結日方資金之後，荷屬東印度採取平行措置，並且進一步廢止去冬十一月所訂日荷貨幣協定，使雙方關於日本購取荷印石油所成立的妥協宣告中止。荷印宗邦至今仍在英倫蒙之中，但却不以此而减低其信心和勇氣，毅然立在經濟制裁的最前綫，採取了比較英美更進一步的步驟，那些依附强禦自隳國威的若干歐陸國家，相形之下，是應該爲之慚沮的。</p>
<p>荷印是日本南進的主要目標，但是年餘以來，其在荷印的進展却遠不如在越南之順利，小林芳澤兩度前往談判，始終不能摧折荷印當局的嚴正態度。小林留印兩月，其所僅能獲得者只是三萬噸飛機油與若干原油的增加；芳澤以日本壇玷耆宿的資格繼當折衝之任，結果也僅在談判決裂聲中悄然遄返。現在日本的國際金融活動和對外貿易旣在英美集團之內遭受阻絕，荷印又收回了統制油類輸日的權利，並且表示不惜在遭遇侵略之時破壞所有油井，留給侵略者一片焦土。南進之效未見，却已自陷於空前困境，銳意主張發動南進者流，際此當亦難免爽然自失吧！</p>
<p>隨着最近事態的演進，遠東局勢已進於空前嚴重之境，其是吾竟會因而爆發新的戰爭，正是在每個人心頭上都要泛起來的問題。但是同時與此相反的，從許久以前即已存在着的對遠東表樂觀的見解，際此又復微波盪漾，不時以淸凉散的形態澆在世人緊張的心頭，而昨日所傳日人表示準備中止南進的消息，似乎也正增强此種見解的力量。則此一局勢前途的趨向，究竟是惡化，是緩和，是戰爭的爆發，是苟安的延續，無疑將成爲若干爭論的焦點。</p>
<p>從目前種種跡象看來，那種樂觀見解亦自有其相當的根據：第一，此度日本之於法越，本是針對着國際間綏靖殘餘空氣的存在，作避重就輕的投機，先頭並未準備付以重大的代價，而日來民治國家所採報復手段的積極。則幾乎全出意料之外。第二，此度美國所施經濟制裁，雖云嚴厲，也未嘗不稍具伸縮，俾爲日方留有悔禍餘地；日方所施報復，顯亦視英美嚴厲程度爲轉移，則只要有一方不爲已甚，他方殆亦不致過相逼煎。第三，近頃國際形勢適値侵略的退潮，納粹旣被陷入蘇聯西境的泥淖，義大利更跼蹐坐困於地中海畔，她們只望獲得遠東方面的助力，却斷然無力聲援其遠東的盟國；而在民治陣容和蘇聯，則實力增强，互謀合作，在世界各個角落都採取嚴密的警戒，這絕不是投機冒險的良機，到是侵略罪行的末路。侵略者的存心一向是避重就輕，不勞而獲，如果明知前面是個可遭滅頂的陷阱，未必竟一味輕進冥行，自貽伊戚，即使前面眞的再沒有其他途徑可走，而後退又所不甘，則他亦必先要停頓考慮一下。</p>
<p>根據這種看法，是吾就可斷言遠東局勢之外張內弛呢？却叉不然；其前途的歸趨完全要看國際形勢的推移與雙方實力的對比。目前問題的中心並不在日本將要怎樣，而要看民治國的對策夠不夠嚴密和堅强；事之可慮，也不在日方若干急進份子之躁妄，而在於民治國家所殘存着苟安心理與樂觀情緒。歐洲戰局未必從此就一瀉千里直達到民治國勝利的順利完成，侵略陣綫在逆境之中也不會就默爾而息，而不更以困獸猶鬥的姿態以期挽回其噩運，則日本現當即便以最大的忍耐不在目前多所妄動以免刺激民治國家，但却一定要竭力利用和消化其業已攫得的權益，從民治國家的再度弛懈中完成其所謂高度國防及中國淪陷區與日滿越南的「共榮圈」。則假如歐局再有某種偶然的變化或逆轉，其所影響到遠柬者可斷言其絕非和平的一慕。北面與蘇聯有中立保證的存在，南面從台灣海南島以迄西貢已然搭好了連續的跳板，如果說在此種形勢下而可以長期相安，那正是一種極端危險的看法。</p>
<p>舉例來說：有如中國反攻實力之未臻成熟，英美與蘇聯間關於遠東之尚乏合作，在戰略上，在相距極遠的新加坡泗水達文港珍珠港荷蘭港而外，還沒有更適於在中國海或日本海鄰近作戰的近捷海空根據地，這些都是亟待改進的弱點；而且荷印關於經濟制裁從事於積極措置以後。也需要英美更强有力的支持。假如美國經濟制裁少留餘地的用意是爲了爭取時間因素以備計出萬全，則吾人自無間言；但如果那只是根據另一看法而期待着遠東局勢的緩和或者侵略者的悔禍，實不能不促起關係方面對潛在的遠東危機作更進一步的檢討和認識。</p>

<h3 id="c28">戰時的牛津大學 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>至於各院學生的戰時生活究竟怎樣？他們的訓練比較平時自然困難枯寂而且辛苦得多了。牛津有幾個學院已整個被國家徵發。其餘學院也有一部份參加政府行政工作。這些學院的學生都因全部或局部併人隣近的學院去了。</p>
<p>學生們不僅以騎跨學院爲常事，而且功踝的艱苦，游戲的减少，也是空前未有。他們開足速率，盡力想把九學期的功課，五學期內修畢。同時，體格健全的學生，統統編入高級生訓團，每星期至少必須操練六七小時。</p>
<p>學生們感到戰爭的威脅，國族瀕存亡絕　之交，已無平日一般的閑情逸致，出人俱樂部，開音樂會，演戲或辯論（雖然牛津學生的辯論會，仍繼續舉行），也沒有讀閑書和談天的功夫。有許多學院聯合選拔僅存的運勸員，組織運動團體，但比賽的時間，已受限制。敎師們承認各院學生大都用功過度，最好梢事休養。然而今日的三島，人人不遑寗處，誰敢先天下之樂而樂呢。</p>
<p>但牛津的學生們，對於種種困苦，頗能安之若素，甚至反因費用减低而暗地裏表示歡迎。牛津的學子，大部份出身貧寒。自從政府大規模頒發補助金，並增加地方獎學金名額後，牛津和劍橋兩大學的學生間，都形成貧當對立的狀態。紈袴子果然不少，布衣階級畢竟居多數。</p>
<p>牛津自戰事發生以來，規定每生每日納費十二仙令，宿費，電費，聽差及食物各項費用，統統在內。加上學費和雜費，每生每學期僅須五六十鎊，而各生每學年三學期的豫算表達二百至二百二十五鎊。有幾個學院，爲幫助貧苦學生起見，免費供給膳食，或給他們別種優待，學生們則在課餘之暇，擔任防空工作，以爲報答。</p>
<p>敎職員大部未動，倒很自在。年紀較輕的人，常然已被徵發，年事較長的，已參加政府工作。其他的人，正在陸續離去。但幹部人材仍盛，戰前許多德高望重的敎授們，繼續爲學校增光。</p>
<p>有名的講師，如齊美恩（Zimmern），霍治華斯（Holdsworth），沃門（Charles　Omen），羅斯（Dabid　Ross），諸爵士及摩萊（Gilbert　Murray），考普蘭（Coupland），霍特金（Hodgkin），波惠克（Powicke），亞當（Adams），戈爾頓（Gordon），史密斯（Nichol　Smith）諸大學者，都照常講學，好學不倦的學生，儘可去飽聆偉論。總之，大學的課程豐富廣博，一如平日。</p>
<p>冬天的晚上，在高級同舉的休憇室裏，燃着融融的煤火，在蔽光的帷幔後面，燈光映在先代許多碩彥的肖像上面，歡樂的情景，一如往日。屋裏倘若蛋糕不多，水莫無着，但酒味總是爽口，而最引人入勝的，莫如各人談笑風生，妙語如珠。巴特萊盎學院裏，往往可以發現歐洲各地亡命而來的學者，他們從軸心國摧殘下的各大學逃來，其中不乏胼手胝足之人，如西班牙的瑪達里亞加，有非其他學者所及。</p>
<p>牛津大學圖書公司，在全世界出版業中，屈指可數，現仍不斷出版皇皇鉅著。它不惜在這個烏烟瘴氣的時代，出版一部得獎的學術著作。這是巴特萊著的「高加索的縱橫地勢」，精印兩大巨冊，售價六個金幣。阿許摩里恩等博物院雖將最名貴的物品，存放安全地點，但不盡的珍藏，仍源源而來。巳故亨特別史密斯所贈的法國現代藝術品一宗，乃當世罕見之物，爲牛津生色不少。</p>
<p>歐洲在戰雲籠罩下，幾乎成爲黑漆一片，牛津的學燈竟仍輝煌地照着。這所具有七百年歷史的大學，始終爲人類肩着兩種偉大的使命。一種是追踪先賢的遺風，勤學善誘，爲眞理和學術文化而努力。當歐洲大部份文明被蹂躪的時候，她屹然不動，以扶持人類生活至高的原則爲己任。另一方面，大學實行動員，爲人道和民族的戰爭，盡其應盡的力量，栽培靑年學子，提早他們畢業期限，送他們上前綫。個個學生知道兵役就在當頭，他有立即爲國捐軀的義務。</p>
<p>牛津各學院裏，不時傳來也征同學的零星消息。這些消息有時慘不忍聞。這一位在德國成了俘虜，那一位在里比亞喪生，另一位在鄧寇克蒙難，再有一位在北海戰役中陣亡。陣亡的人數雖不如一九一四—一八年之年，但正在繼續增加呢。</p>

<p>— 由義</p>
<p>（香港特的通訊）法屬越南有四個重要的都市：就是海防，（Haiphong，河內，Hanoi）不　奔（Pnom-Penh及西貢，（Saigon）海防，河內，去年曾受極大的刺激，結果借與日軍作根據地了，不囊奔在泰越糾紛中受了不少的驚駭，現在西貢又遭海防，河內的同樣命運！</p>
<p>在法屬越南的許多城市中，我最忘不了的就是西貢，不僅因爲她不斷地供給我們上海食糧的關係，因爲她實是法人經營最力，而又是越南最重要的一個商埠和軍港。</p>
<p>越南的幾州中，最早墮入法國掌握中的，就是交趾支那州（CochinChine）（在一八〇五年）西貢就是這州的都會，並且在名稱上，這州也和別州不同，這是法屬的殖民地（Clonie）其餘各州則稱保護邦（Proteetorat），這州最高行政官稱爲總督Gouverneur，不像別州的都稱「留守使」（Resident　Superienr），法人把這州經營最力的緣故，大約這也是原因之一。</p>
<p>越南是世界三大產米地之一，其中產米最多的也祇有二區：一是東東三角洲，另一個就是交趾立那州。北部的東京產米區雖然產米量也不少，可是人口密，所以可以大量運銷國外的，也祗有交趾支那州了。西貢米的專門名稱，也就使每個食米者熟知了。</p>
<p>越南二部不僅產米，同是叉產橡膠，咖啡，一類的農產品；有很多的法國人買了一大方稻田，或是一個橡膠樹園，過幾年就成一個闊綽的富翁了！橡膠原是南洋一帶的特產，越南南部的種植橡膠樹却更祗是近一二十年的事，越南的橡膠產量雖比不上荷屬東印度，和馬來亞羣島，可是在質的方面確有過之無不及。歐洲戰事發生後，直至最近日本借據越甫南部前，因爲法國和越南的航運困難，這裏的米大部銷售與遠東各地，如；日本，上海，香港，新加坡，印度等地。橡膠則大半運銷美國，或運新加坡的橡膠市塲再轉銷歐美。</p>
<p>華僑在越南，也以在南部經營的爲大多數，大的佔全數的四分之三，離西貢六公里有個堤岸城（Cholon）法人稱之爲「中國城」，這裏半數以上的居民是我們閩廣的同胞。他們有的開輾米廠，有的開內河運輸公司，有的開各式各樣的酒館鋪子，華僑的學校也不少。我們初到西貢，旁人就告訴我們「中國城」的名字，我們到了那裏，眞不覺這裏是法屬的堤岸城，幾乎疑心我們已到了自己的廣州或汕頭呢！</p>
<p>西貢華僑之中，有位姓黃的，福建籍，是全越南最富的一個財主，他擁有極大的地產，和很多的店鋪和當鋪，他家裹有好幾個法國會計師爲他管帳，好幾家建築公司搶着爲他設計包工，最近在跑馬塲附近，他們叉蓋了七幢宮殿式的住宅，預備自己居住，大概現在已經搬進去了。</p>
<p>跟別處的華僑組織一樣，西貢的華僑也有許多「公所」和「會館」招呼着新來或貧病的同鄕，及辦理一切團體組織的事務，這裏也有個商會，代表許多華僑的商人。</p>
<p>在河內，海防及西貢，中國都設有領事館的，自從日軍在海防及河內登陸後，那裹的領館暫就停止辦公，託由美國領館代理，最近西貢的事情發生後，那裏的領館又告停閉。在法德停戰前，西南諸省的國際交通綫，原以滇越路爲最便，自從該路封鎖後，滯留在海防西貢的商貨仍有不少，不久以前，聽說海防倉庫裏的商貨已被搬走了，現在西貢的不知又將怎樣了？</p>
<p>我很關心越南，因為在那裏我住過幾時；在那裏，我有着許多朋友；我很知道越南南部的富庶，我又很爲越南目前的命運而悲傷；法人有時解釋安南二字時，稱爲這是「南方的和平」La　Paix　Du　Sud，我但願她永遠不忘了她的名字！可是現在的它總不免有山雨欲來風滿樓之感吧！</p>

<h3 id="c51">進出口商正當需要　可依不獲得外滙　法幣需求激增地位益固　黑匯波動昨已轉趨穩定 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>自美國首先宣佈凍結中國日本資金、英國等亦採取平行行動、對於中國任何部份與英美南美洲蘇聯及荷印間之進出口貿易、應作如何處置、本市美商銀行於前日接奉美財政部第五十八號第五十九號實施訓令後、始有所遵循、業已於前日下午起、開始實行、將遠東之合法貿易置諸美國執照制管理下、在二十六日後之四日中、由謠言蠭起、投機份子從中作崇、金融市塲、情形一度甚爲混亂、殆至昨日、已納入正軌、復趨於穩定、凡進出口商人正當需要、皆可申請供給、法幣需要旣激增、地位益形鞏固、便値亦將上漲、故其前途甚可樂觀、茲分誌昨日所得各項消息於後、</p>
<p>申請外滙須具保證</p>
<p>關於申請供給外滙辦法、據麥加利銀行高級職員語大中社記者、必須由銀行界保證、申請者確爲正當商行、並爲正當之用途、不資日、不移轉於中國以外之國家、具有擔保資格者、爲外商銀行洋行十四家、至華商銀行可吾擔保、據稱不詳、但謂昨晚（二十九日）各華商銀行當局、曾舉行會議、商討如何維持華商正當之對外貿易辦法、至本埠外商銀行公會之協議、並無具體結果、決秉承各國政府頒布辦法實施之、昨日美商銀行美金存戶、仍可照常提取、並無限制、花旗銀行對美滙亦照常買賣、一如往昔、滙豐銀行進出口部職員則稱、目下對中日兩國商人之滙票、巳一槪不收、消息又似甚矛盾、</p>
<p>外滙黑市益趨穩定</p>
<p>昨晨上海外滙「黑市」、英商滙豐銀行掛牌並無較諸前市有所軒輊、交易行市英滙三辨士一七一八七五、美滙五元二一八七五、比前市均鬆長〇三一二五、故本市「黑市」外滙業已轉趨穩定並無過去之條鬆倐緊現象發生、倘各銀行如已有外滙頭寸者、仍得自由買賣外滙、昨向本市銀行界探悉、嗣後凡中國必需物品、方能獲得合法而正當之外滙、惟奢侈品等如欲輸入要求供給外滙、勢將愈感困難、至於一般投機商人欲以買賣外滙牟利、事實上已不若過去之便利、所以將來之上海滙市、決能持久穩定、而正當商人、及各種合法營業、決不致受任何影響、但投機商人顯已遭受嚴重打擊矣、</p>
<p>現行凍結並不澈底</p>
<p>大中社記者於昨日下午、曾往訪某金融界著名人士、叩訽對於此兩號實施訓令之觀感、據告、美國凍結中日兩國資金、對合法商業活動、毫無影響、因吾人就實施訓令之內容言、雖有種種限制、但富有伸縮性、深知華府僅願將美國與遠東之貿易、置諸美政府管理之下、據銀行家解釋、中日兩國人士、此後凡存有美滙者、依然可提取、不特中國正當商人、即在中國經商之正當日商、仍可申請供給外滙、並無限制、此爲凍結令之最大漏洞、日商如利用頂替辦法、亦毫無方法可抵制、故疑仍有綏靖作用存乎其間、甚望十四銀行、能在技術方面、有澈底抵制辦法、</p>
<p>法幣信用愈形增高</p>
<p>據俄文日報記載自日本資金被凍結後、已發生如下反應、（一）美滙日圓、均受緊縮與限制、獨中國法幣地位、不受影響、信用價値將增高、（二）預料此後投機家將無法購得外滙、黑市必受嚴重打擊、本埠滙市可趨於穩定、（三）中國正常貿易、仍可以法幣購取外滙、自由中國資金、將益見充沛、（四）日本對外貿易僅限於日圓集團、此後勢將益形不振、</p>

<p>爲報復英美凍結中日資金而由日方發動之海關禁運、自二十八日開始實行以來、範圍愈趨廣大、禁運出口商品由八種增至十一種、咋日海關總務科日稅務司小山田又另頒通告、修正禁運物品單、結果禁止出口之商品、更增至十五種之多、本埠英美及共他友邦出口貿易、因禁運商品種類、逐日變換、紊亂不定、故出口業務、幾陷入停滯狀態、昨日滬各國行商向海關要求結關運貨出口者紛至沓來、但結果無不失望而歸、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>禁運品增至十五類</p>
<p>海關總務科日稅務司小山田田光、於昨晨十一時三十分、發出修正之禁運通吿、謂「下列各種貨品、暫時禁止運往（包括轉口及復出口在內）外洋（日本除外）或中國口岸（淪陷區域除外）、（一）生皮及熟皮、（毛皮及衣服皮貨除外）（二）麩皮、包括米麩及麥麩）（三）米與穀、（四）麥及麵粉、（五）顏料·染料·油漆·塗粉·琺瑯·色料等、（六）植物油及植物食料、（七）橡皮、（製造品除外）（八）煤、（九）棉花及棉絮、（十）火蔴·　麻·苧蔴、（十一）羊毛、（十二）各種礦砂、（十三）各種五金、（十四）機器、（十五）醫用及工業用之化學物品、（植物化學品除外）」以上共十五類、計二十七種、一律停止禁運出口、</p>
<p>將由日方統制操縱</p>
<p>上項通告中、將前定禁運之糧食·肥料·及棉布織物等除外、據悉海關日稅務司不再另頒以上三種物品停止禁運之通告、因前此所發通告、已告作廢、在昨日佈告中禁運品十五類以外之物品、一律准許結關出口、據消息靈通人士指出、禁運之十五類物品幾均爲國防工業及軍需製造之必需品、此次被禁出口後、將由日方予以統制操縱、大量運往日木本國及淪陷區域、至其他國籍之出口商人、共傳統合法之利益、將來被摒棄摧殘、此種措置、固爲報復英美凍結中日資金而發、但受害者豈僅爲英美商人、即其他友邦亦同受影響、華商貿易尤以與自由區發生關係者、蒙　最烈、</p>

<p>車行中途突遭槍擊</p>
<p>陳志洪、年四十歲、寗波人、係充公共租界警務十號探員、派在老閘捕房服務、迄今已歷三載、平時頗忠職守、且聞精通日語、前在東京開設食品商店、家寓廣東路三八〇弄貴興里九號、昨晨八時十一分、陳乘自備包車（車夫爲台州人小麻皮阿三）由家出外，循例赴行辦公、不料行至九江路福建路之際、突有兇徒二名、分別預伏於九江路源源旅社及對面甬江狀元樓菜館前、見陳乘車而來、即向開槍轟擊、</p>

<p>廠布昨市先跌繼漲、售盤上落殊巨、其中要原因、乃爲前日禁止出口以後、東疋最受影響、市價猛　、反使自身發生不利、解鈴繫鈴、不得不撤消紗布禁令、而海關方面、自亦從而准許出口、於是人氣轉濃、買風重振、富貴細布晨售四十四元、富貴細斜四十一元七角半、午後回漲至四十五元七角與四十二元半、結果漲五角至七角半、餘檔漲度彷彿、粗布平平、漂染布升五角至一元、本街成交各布三　餘件、粵港南洋幫上日退關貨、亟圖補裝出口、新添辦祇一百餘件、北路烟津幫辦粗布絨布絨呢等一百五六十件、</p>

<p>三、記憶的類別記憶分（一）機械的記憶、（二）理解的記憶、（三）具體的記憶、（四）抽象的記憶、</p>
<p>（一）機械的記憶　記憶機械的或有意義的事物、</p>
<p>（二）理解的記憶　記憶有意義有棧索的事物、</p>
<p>（三）具體的記憶　有具體事物存在、比較易於記憶、</p>
<p>（四）抽象的記憶　比較具體的難於記憶、</p>
<p>四、記憶的方法</p>
<p>關於記憶的方法、可分下列數項、</p>
<p>（一）機械記憶法　這種方法、就是把那無意義的材料、如人名·地名·或年月日等、反復的記之、</p>
<p>（二）調理記憶法　這種方法、就是順着理論·秩序·關係的一貫而記憶它、不過、須得注意下列幾點、</p>
<p>一、因果關係　由此法若知某事的原因、可以預料它的結果、或知道它的結果、可以推測它的原因、我們閱讀歷史或政治一類的書、都可應用這個方法去記憶它、</p>
<p>二、比較關係　拿事實的異同比較比較、就可記憶它的內容、我們閱讀社會科學如地理等、最好應用這個方法去記憶、</p>
<p>（三）系統關係　就是將事實的系統、分類出來、使共中各關係的部分、讀者發生聯想去記憶它、我們閱讀地質學生物學等書、常用這個方法、</p>
<p>三、技術記憶法　這種方法、就是用技術的方法將事實留記下來、我們書時常用的、得有三種、</p>
<p>（一）號記法　就是我們讀書時、把重要的所在或其它必須記憶之點、加以圈點或畫線、使易於注目而記憶它、</p>
<p>（二）摘記法　就是在閱讀的時候、把書中的綱領和其他可記的事、記到正文的旁邊、以便將來參考、易於查出、</p>
<p>（三）筆記法　就是在閱讀的時候、將書中重要事項記下來、</p>
<p>（四）利用聯想法　這方法好像和調理記憶法相類似、其實不是一樣、它是使許多的觀念密切的連和起來、回想的時候、憶起這許多觀念中的某個、其餘的就能够連續的在腦子裏復現、這種利用聯想的記憶法、又有機械的和關念的不同、</p>

<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>爲了學徒入山訪仙求道，有許多人痛駡神怪的武俠小說；爲了靑年學生倣效俠盜的行爲，也有許多人以爲他們是中了偵探小說的毒。一時掃蕩毒素讀物的聲浪，洋洋盈耳。這固然是文化界的一個好現象，然而到現在爲止，我們祗知道市上有毒素的讀物，毒素的讀物應該嚴加禁止。但是爲甚麽神怪的武俠小說有毒，其毒素發生在那裏？精神毒素的作用怎樣，有毒與無毒的標準又在那裏？這些比較根本的重要問題，却還沒有人提出來討論，以致我們徒知其然，而不知其所以然。僅見其現象與作用，而不知其根據與來源。</p>
<p>這個文藝上的重要問題，其作用與影響是發生在人類的心理上與精神方面的，因此我們應該把它看做一個心理的問題。一般講來，文藝作品對於讀者的影響，是發生在情緒方面的。委婉曲折的情節引人人勝，微妙動人的描寫令人爲之神往，男女主人翁的遭遇引起了我們的痛恨或同情，於是激起了我們的喜，怒，哀，樂，驚奇，恐懼…的情緒。情緒的發生原是一種普通的事，然而文藝作品的有毒與吾，就全以它所激起的情緒爲標準。如果它所激起的，是一種空幻虛無的情緒，對於現實生活毫無補益的，這就是有毒素的讀物。</p>
<p>良好的讀物應該替讀者指出一條有實感的建設性的情緒的出路！</p>

<h3 id="c99">炸藥專家 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 增修</p>
<p>炸藥眞是一樣奇怪的東西。它能殺人，也能造福人羣。如今美國的炸藥，還不曾往大砲裏面裝，可是每日所耗費的數量，已經在一百萬磅以上。原來開鑛·採石·工程·農業，以及其他許多種事業，都有用炸藥的地方，可見炸藥足能將功贖罪。</p>
<p>關於炸藥的這類用途，有一點値得大書特書的，就是使用它的專家具有豐富的學識和經騐，能將某處需用某種炸藥多少，計算得不差毫釐，吾則弄巧成拙，危險不堪設想。譬如某處有一座無用的烟囱，祇能用炸藥將它炸塌，道時管理炸藥的專家，必須大顯神通，使從空中墜下來的磚塊瓦屑，聚在一個特定的地點以內，或者甚至於堆在一根直立的木棒的周圍，決不會狼藉滿地，不可收拾。</p>
<p>某工廠裝修內部，一定要拆去幾座洋灰澆成的機器座子。惟一的方法就是利用炸藥，可是炸藥的力量，必須恰到好處，纔能避免損失，因爲那些座子的附近，有許多貴重的電機，而且廠屋的屋頂和四壁裝滿了玻璃。負責的專家於是施展身手，用適當的炸藥炸去全部無用的座子，保全了廠中的一切設備。</p>
<p>有一家銀行炸毀一座墻垣，也請了專家負責辦理。那座墻塌下來的時候，銀行照常營業，任何顧客或行員不曾受驚。</p>
<p>那些專家的控制炸藥，眞是間不容髮。他們斟酌情形，決定應用的炸藥的種類和份量，沒有過份或不及之弊。從美國可樂雷度河通至洛杉磯的地道，長九十二英里，就是利用炸藥，在六年之間鑿成的，若是那時沒有炸藥，恐怕費一千年的光陰，也難完工。我們都曉得炸藥是破壞的利器，所以一堆炸藥，能在一刹那間，造成一條闊一十八英尺，深十二英尺，長一千七百英尺的河道，不算希奇，但是美國的菓園，常常利用炸藥，使菓類生長迅速，確是一件奇事。專家在菓園的地下，埋了炸藥，使它能在爆發以後，將泥土炸鬆，因此菓樹的根容易蔓延，泥土也容易吸收水分，結果所有的樹木，欣欣向榮。牠們開花結實，比通常要早兩季呢。不會開花的枯樹，有時也靠着少許炸藥的功勞，漸漸復活。</p>
<p>美國政府從前在卑濕的區域中築路，不得不分段進行逐漸塡平高高低低的水坑，纔能造好路基，所以一條公路往往費時數年，方可完工。現在有了炸藥專家，在適當的地點敷設炸藥，祇須一舉手之勞，就能將泥坑全變成平地了。</p>
<p>總之，炸藥的用途，日見摧廣。農民利用它炸除田地上的岩石；公共事業公司利用它在地上掘坑，以便安設電綫竿子；美國南部的農民利用它採集松脂；工廠利用它炸去機器上的生銹的鐵栓和蝶旋；同時炸藥也能殺滅害鳥，移除沉船。</p>
<p>近來數年間，炸藥又有一種新的用途，更爲可驚，就是開發油田的公司請了專家，利用炸藥，探尋油源。那些專家將相當分量的炸藥　自數英兩起至四十磅止，視各地的情形而定　埋在地底，並且在一英里至七英里之外，安置精巧的儀器，測量炸藥爆發後的震動程度，用攝影機將它們紀錄下來。科學家根據那種紀錄，研究岩石的性質和震動的時間，就能知道何處藏有石油和金屬，萬無一失。</p>
<p>每年春季，美國人在洛杉磯山中，利用炸藥，淸除地面的積雪，但是不損道路。這又是炸藥專家的功勞，大可驚佩。加拿大的魁百克省，有幾位工程師和炸藥專家合作，在急流中造成一座一萬一千噸重的水閘（用水泥澆成，高九十二呎，寬四十五呎，厚四十呎，一端緊靠河岸），完成多少年來沒法進行的工程。他們就是利用了一千磅炸藥，使那樣重的水閘，在驚險的河流中牢牢地站住。</p>
<p>誰說科學有罪？炸藥是建設事業的功臣，不是一個明顯的例子嗎？</p>

<p>差不多沒有等尙老二把話說完，梅寳已搶着回答了。</p>
<p>「這是什麽話！師傳，祇要我把戲畢成，這還有什麽說的？」她根本不懂得梨園的規矩，那裏知道尙老二所說的「靠」，其範圍是那樣的廣啊！舞台上正有許多紅角兒，在上塲的時候，紥扮得那樣富麗，但到了台下，却終年祇穿一件藍布大褂，身邊甚至一塊錢也掏不出來；都爲他們當初也答應了一聲讓師傳靠老，結果却就成了師傳的搖錢樹！</p>
<p>這種關節，尚老二自己當然是知道得再淸楚沒有的，但他也未嘗不察覺梅寳的聰明，深怕條件講得太早，這棵搖錢樹的種子會馬上飛回去。</p>
<p>「不錯，你的良心倒眞是好的，這幾天來我已經看得很淸楚了！不過規矩是規矩，再隔幾天，好歹要請你爸爸寫　張字據，那末彼此也好放心。」他故意不讓他那一張給鴉片烟燒得剩了一重皮的臉上，露出絲毫認眞的成分來，只裝絕不介意的樣子。</p>
<p>當聽到這幾句的時候，梅寶的心裏也未嘗不躊躇了一下。儘管她還不能料到一張所謂「字據」的內容究竟如何，但尙老二旣說要她爸爸出面，那末看來這件事就不能不凑早告訴她父親了。</p>
<p>這一點却是她所最感困難的。</p>
<p>「那未，師傳，能不能待他病好了再寫呢？」她陪着十二分的小心問。</p>
<p>尙老二眞是最懂得「欲擒故縱」的法門的。「不忙，隨便什麽時候都行」他還是一路笑，一路輕輕地說：「明天起，咱們先把一齣武家坡學完了再說。」（一七二）</p>

<p>美國有一家人家，畜有母狗一頭，不幸在生產了六頭小狗以後，母狗死了。這主人看見六頭小狗孤苦無依，非常可憐，於是別出心裁，替牠們製造了一頭母狗，用一塊木板鑿成六個小洞，把飼嬰孩用的乳瓶倒裝了，讓這六個小孤狗有了一個人造的母狗，照樣同時吃乳。</p>

<p>— 增</p>
<p>普通人大概有一種思想，以爲本國的飛機，飛到敵國境內轟炸，倘使改變機身的漆色，一定比較容易冒充那一國的飛機。其實這種軍事上的詭計，現在各國空軍，不大施用。其主要原因之一就是各國的軍艦和飛機都帶着每日更換的通訊密碼。當一架飛機在軍艦上面的空中翱翔的時候，海軍方面便發出本國飛機應該能够回答的秘密電碼，但是那架飛機若是屬於敵國的，就無法用正確的密碼（或若干連續的信號）答覆。所以任何飛機如果不能立作作正確的答覆，準受到砲火的猛攻。此外另有一層事實就是敵國飛機的形狀，都經地面防軍仔細研究過，因此即使牠們在遠處高飛，也是難得不被立刻識破的。</p>

<p>— 江水</p>
<p>提起米蓋羅納這一個名字，眞是大名鼎鼎，誰個不知？那個不曉？好萊塢的電影皇帝就是他，「哈代家庭片」的主角亦是他，在銀幕上他是一個活潑的，伶俐的大孩子，是一個滑稽的，詼諧的大脚色。可是你知道他在業餘幹些什麼玩意兒嗎？讀書，不錯，讀書之外還做些什麼呢？什麽是他最喜歡的嗜好呢？他怎樣消遣他的空閑呢？我們得知道，他非但在銀幕上是一位演技精湛的明星，在銀幕下他的特長，他的成功亦正不下於電影哩。</p>
<p>多才多藝</p>
<p>他是好萊塢一個最忙的人。演戲之外，是一個作曲家，一個樂隊的指揮，一個雜誌的主編，一個木匠，一個牧塲主人，不多幾時前，他還掛了塊招牌竟做起鷄蛋商來了；你也許知道，他還在學習做一個導演呢。</p>
<p>需要嗜好</p>
<p>「你大槪不會想到我整天的工作就只是拍電影吧？」他有一次對一個新聞記者如此地說道。「不，我覺得，每個人都應該有一些嗜好。所謂嗜好呢，我的意思，不是做那些你所歡喜去做的事情；我以爲嗜好乃是一種可以回復你身心的疲勞的東西。它叫你早上該早些起來，不會呆躺在床上。它會叫你在劇烈工作八小時後珢快地恢復你原來的精神。」「所以，我一有了空閑，」他又吿訴我們道：「我就喜歡寫曲子。有時候祇寫那末三四行，有時候非待全首歌曲寫畢是不肯罷手的。」</p>
<p>業餘著述</p>

<p>榮春鳴春競排新戲</p>
<p>榮春社和鳴春社是北平的兩個小科班，前者爲尙小雲氏所主持。也許就因爲主持人的關係吧，他們都歡喜在「佈景，歌舞」等形式上考究。榮春社在中和戲院長期公演，上演的戲有什麽「雙龍鬬峨嵋」，「雙心鬬」等，並且還以「奇情仙蹟，歌舞劍俠」「龍潭佈景，五色電光」等字句作號召，鳴春社則在慶樂戲院演出，上演的戲有「唐王遊地獄」，及連台的「狸貓換太子」等，也以「佈景新穎，驚奇彩砌」等字句爲幌子，看了這兩個科班，都盲目的走上「自殺」之路，眞有些啼笑皆非</p>
<p>富社戲校分頭演出</p>
<p>富連成和戲曲學校倒還比較像樣一些，現在富社白夫在華樂戲院公演，可惜因爲人才的缺乏，號召力反不及榮春鳴春强大。至於戲曲學校，自從因故解散後，幾個角兒，都各樹一幟，分別組班，最近有一部份學生，以「戲校同學消夏合作」的名義，在長安戲院上演，戲碼有「閙學」，「掃松」，「刺巴杰」，及「得意緣」等。侯玉蘭目出科後，就搭班任正樑旦角，最近聽說有人拉攏和白玉薇合作一戲，劇目已定「三婦艷」這戲本是「戲校」所編小本艷情戲之一，原來主演的角兒除侯白二人外，尙有李玉茹，現在王茹玉薇旣已各自組班合作不易，所以玉茹所飾一角，只好另行物色了。</p>

<p>第十三章　不肯低頭在草莽</p>
<p>許靖待他們叫了一回，手中一石子飛出，正中一頭狼的左眼。那狼吃了一石子。疼痛非凡，叫得更是凄厲。只因許靖高高在樹上，奈何他不得，只是跳。許靖隔了一回，又一石子飛出，打中狼的頸項。這樣相持了好多時候，許靖共發出八顆石子，顆顆擊中。那兩頭狼也跳得筋疲力盡，一些得不到便宜，旣不能够噬人，又不捨得離開。許靖瞧着他們力竭聲嘶的樣子，知道兩狼已是無能爲也已了，他就一躍而下，舞開赤鳳寳劍，直取他們的要害。兩狼見許靖下樹，尚極力向許靖猛撲，可是力氣終究消耗殆盡，那裏近得許靖的身。許靖將劍使急了，白光迅速落下時，一頭狼已仆倒於地。祇剩一頭狼了。許靖更是定心，又和那狼鬥了一會，待那狼撲上自己頭頂時，一劍掃去，砍中狼的左前爪。那狼向地下一滾，正要再扒起時，許靖又是一劍劈下，把那狼一揮兩截。許靖連殺三狼，身上也濺着幾點血跡，提劍四顧，意態陡覺雄壯，不覺信口高歌道。。</p>
<p>天蒼蒼兮雲茫茫，仗劍出塞兮志軒昂，殲彼么魔兮如豺狼！</p>
<p>歌數闋，柳隱英巳從山下走回，見許靖仗劍立在門外，樹上懸着一狼，地上又橫仆着兩頭死狼，他不覺大爲奇異，便問道：「靖哥，這些豺狼都死於你的劍下嗎？」許靖遂將自己如何先後誅斃三狼的經過告訴他聽。柳隱英欣喜道：「靖哥智勇俱全，能獨殲三狼，將來削平流寇，也能像這樣的草薙爲獮，殺個暢快呢。」許靖嘆道：「萑苻遍地，烽烟不靖，滔滔者天下皆是也，安得十萬橫磨，誅盡小醜呢？」二人一同進門去，把門關上。柳隱英又與許靖坐談一刻，便去收拾行李，把要帶的東西裝入行篋，晚間又和許靖對飲至二鼓時分，方纔各目安寢。（一二九）</p>

<p>Reuters, Chicago, 30th - Willkie, in a recent interview with reporters, stated that if the Soviet army can hold out until September, Hitler's doomsday will begin to arrive, and Germany's defeat will be faster than most people expect.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 30th - Oxford College stated today that the German army is already using up its oil reserves sparingly. If the Red Army can hold out until autumn, the German blitzkrieg in the Soviet Union may come to a halt due to lack of oil.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Order from the Southern Front Headquarters of the Red Army: Frontline Supervision Boosts Morale - Enemy Troops in the Ukrainian Region Retreat Dozens of Miles - German Dream of Conquering Moscow Shattered <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>TASS, 30th, with the military correspondent - There have been fierce battles on the Ukrainian front in recent days. Marshal Budyonny, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Front of the Red Army, personally commanded on the front lines, greatly boosting morale. The enemy has been forced to retreat dozens of kilometers. Initially, the German army attacked fiercely along the highway, the sound of killing shaking the sky, but the Red Army remained unmoved. Only when the enemy approached did they unleash devastating artillery fire, causing the German battle lines to collapse and retreat. Under the cover of artillery fire, the Red Army began to counterattack. At this crucial moment, Marshal Budyonny, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Front, suddenly appeared in the forest, greatly boosting the morale of the Red Army. They shouted, "Comrade Budyonny has arrived!" and fearlessly charged the enemy motorcycle units with bayonets. Under the Red Army's overwhelming offensive, the enemy began to collapse and retreat in disarray. The Red Army advanced over corpses, pursuing them for fifteen kilometers before stopping.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 30th - Moscow Radio broadcast a communiqué yesterday, stating that the Soviet Union's repeated decisive counterattacks had driven the German army out of positions near Smolensk. The communiqué stated, "Our troops are engaged in battle with the enemy in Novoshovsk, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhytomyr, with the fiercest fighting in the Smolensk region. As a result of our army's repeated decisive counterattacks, the enemy has been driven out of those positions. The enemy suffered heavy casualties during the retreat." The communiqué also stated that other fronts only saw skirmishes and local battles. It also stated, "Our air force, in cooperation with ground troops, inflicted significant blows on the enemy forces concentrated on various fronts. On the 27th and 28th, our air force shot down 75 German planes, while we lost 51 planes."</p>
<p>Frontline reports also stated that there was fierce fighting in the southern lowlands of Ukraine. A large enemy unit was annihilated by the Red Army. According to the report, the area was littered with the corpses of German soldiers, abandoned military vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, and artillery. The Soviet army pursued the remaining German troops for nine miles. An official communiqué stated that in a certain area of the Smolensk front, Soviet troops occupied many artillery positions, and each of these positions had many Austrians, all in chains, who were killed next to the machine guns. The communiqué also stated that, according to an Austrian soldier named Kerber, who was operating a machine gun, he was ordered to be stationed at the position and to fire the guns without rest until the German troops retreated. Frontline dispatches also stated that German infantry, under the cover of 20 tanks, attacked a railway station. Soviet reinforcements arrived and, with the help of armored trains and heavy artillery fire, defeated the German troops, annihilating over 200 of them. United Press, Moscow, 30th - According to last night's official report, Soviet armored units, in a fierce counterattack, annihilated a Nazi mechanized unit. At the same time, the Red Army's air force and ground troops fiercely resisted the new German offensive in the Smolensk-Nevel region. The army seized it. This battle occurred when a unit of Nazi motorized and mechanized troops attempted to break through the Soviet defense line and meet up with Nazi tank units that had already broken through the defense line. Reports from the front also stated that the Soviet army surrounded the column and annihilated it after a day-long battle.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - According to the latest news received in London, after the Soviet army launched a fierce counterattack in the Smolensk region, tanks from both sides are currently engaged in bloody battles. Both sides claim to have gained an advantage. The latest Soviet communiqué stated that as a result of the Soviet counterattack, the German army had been driven back. Finnish radio stated that the German army had won an unprecedented battle. It was reported that the Soviet army was using tanks weighing over 100 tons in the Smolensk region, heavily damaging the German army. A Berlin spokesman claimed last night, "Finnish troops in the northern region continue to make progress." An official Finnish communiqué stated that Finnish troops had occupied the entire northern shore of Lake Ladoga.</p>

<p>Havas, Stockholm, 29th - According to military sources here, the German army intends to build a new defensive line in southern Russia, from Astrakhan, down the Volga and Don rivers to Arkhangelsk. However, the Red Army has concentrated 50 divisions in the Caucasus to strictly defend against it. Britain and the Soviet Union are also conducting military cooperation. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, has sent many staff officers to the Caucasus, planning to build a new defensive line in the area to protect the oil fields. It is likely that British troops will enter the Caucasus. In addition, the Soviet authorities are continuing negotiations with the London Polish government to release five divisions of Polish troops captured by the Soviet Union during the Soviet-German partition of Poland in 1939. If an agreement can be reached, the prisoners will be sent to the front lines to fight against Germany.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Powerful Soviet Underground Fortresses Threaten German Rear Communications <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>TASS, Stockholm, 30th - The Gothenburg Post stated, "Neutral observers say that a severe danger has arisen in the German rear. The Russians have built powerful underground fortresses. These fortresses launch fierce attacks on the enemy's reserve forces and rear communication lines from time to time. According to military observers, this kind of surprising strategy is beyond the expectations of the Germans and is a prominent feature of modern Russian tactics." The newspaper also stated, "The German elite tank units have not been victorious in battle, and the German offensive has apparently gradually weakened."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - The "Swiss National Daily" stated that recent German documents show that the Germans have abandoned the intention of directly capturing Moscow and penetrating deep into Soviet territory, and instead seek to gain tactical victories. This is not in line with the expectations of most people when the German army captured the Soviet border area in one fell swoop at the beginning of the war. The German communication lines have stretched for hundreds of kilometers and are constantly threatened by guerrillas. Communications are blocked in dozens of locations and are constantly bombed by active enemy air forces. "The Germans now have to maintain the connection between their vanguard outposts and their bases, so they will suffer great losses in time." The "Basitan Daily" Berlin correspondent reported that German military experts hoped that the enemy would suddenly collapse and the Eastern Front war would end, just like the Battle of the Marne in France. However, these experts also admit that this comparison is limited because the Soviet Union, unlike France, still has a large reserve force that has not been mobilized.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 29th - The German News Agency recently published a draft describing the tactics used by Red Army soldiers, stating, "Enemy soldiers on the front lines often hide near corpses, waiting for German troops to pass by, and then suddenly throw grenades at German trucks. Soviet guerrillas hide in the trees, waiting for opportunities to attack German troops." The horror of this war is evident from this, and this is also the reason for the German army's determination to eliminate the entire Red Army.</p>

<p>International News Service, Washington, 30th - According to diplomatic sources received by the State Department, the elite of the German mechanized assault troops have been annihilated due to the Soviet army's fierce resistance. The soldiers currently used by the German army are reserve troops with less experience, so the offensive has slowed down. It is said that these German assault troops were the vanguard of the whirlwind offensives in France, the Dutch lowlands, and the Balkans. It is also said that, up to now, the German army has suffered more than 200,000 casualties, but the loss of these veteran soldiers is even more important than the above-mentioned casualty numbers. It is said that the reserve troops transferred from the rear have no combat experience to resist the Soviet army's fierce defense and counterattacks, so they do not fight as well as the old soldiers.</p>

<p>TASS, 30th, Battlefield Report - Recently, two bombers from the Kotlar Detachment bombed Ploiești, a Romanian oil region. Countless bombs fell on oil fields and oil-filled tanks, and flames shot into the sky. Our pilots safely returned to the airport after carrying out their mission. The next day, a squadron of bombers attacked Iași. The pilots saw that the fire in Ploiești from the previous day had not yet been extinguished. A few days later, Soviet long-range bombers arrived, and the planes of the Kotlar Detachment, together with other long-range bombers, attacked Ploiești again, dropping countless bombs on the oil fields. Romanian anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely. Two of our planes left unharmed, and another one, Mota, was hit by shrapnel but still returned to Soviet territory.</p>

<p>Havas, Finnish Capital, September 9th - It is learned that the Finnish army's offensive in the Karelian region has encountered strong resistance from the Red Army. It will be difficult to break through the Soviet defense line without major efforts. In general, every Soviet soldier is determined to fight to the death. Every soldier defends a position, and will not abandon their post unless they are targeted by bayonets. Therefore, the Finnish army still cannot use its unique combat methods, that is, to send reconnaissance teams to sneak into the forest area to destroy the enemy's communication lines and then surround them. However, when the Red Army retreats, they often set fires in the forest, so that the Finnish troops tracking them have to advance in the high heat of 105 degrees Fahrenheit and also guard against swarms of mosquitoes in the forest.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e8">A Perspective on the Future of the Far Eastern Situation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Following the freezing of Japanese funds by the United States and Britain, the Dutch East Indies adopted parallel measures and further abolished the Japanese-Dutch currency agreement signed last November, declaring the end of the compromise reached between the two sides regarding Japan's purchase of oil from the Dutch East Indies. The motherland of the Dutch East Indies is still under the protection of Britain, but this does not diminish its confidence and courage. It resolutely stands on the front line of economic sanctions and takes more advanced steps than Britain and the United States. Compared with those European countries that rely on the strong and abandon their national prestige, it should be ashamed of itself.</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is the main target of Japan's southward advance, but for more than a year, its progress in the Dutch East Indies has not been as smooth as in Vietnam. Yoshizawa Kobayashi went to negotiate twice, but he could not break the solemn attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities. Kobayashi stayed in India for two months, and all he could get was an increase of 30,000 tons of aviation oil and some crude oil. Yoshizawa, who succeeded him as a veteran of Japanese diplomatic circles, also quietly returned home amidst the sound of broken negotiations. Now that Japan's international financial activities and foreign trade have been blocked within the British and American group, the Dutch East Indies has also taken back the right to control the export of oil to Japan, and has stated that it will not hesitate to destroy all oil wells in the event of aggression, leaving the aggressor with scorched earth. The effect of the southward advance has not been seen, but it has fallen into an unprecedented predicament. Those who are determined to launch the southward advance must also inevitably feel lost at this time!</p>
<p>With the evolution of the recent situation, the Far Eastern situation has entered an unprecedentedly serious situation, and the question of whether our end will lead to a new war is a question that everyone must be thinking about. But at the same time, contrary to this, the optimistic view of the Far East that has existed for a long time is once again rippling, and from time to time it is poured on the tense hearts of the world in the form of a cool powder. The news that the Japanese expressed their willingness to stop the southward advance yesterday seems to be strengthening the power of this view. Therefore, the trend of the future of this situation, whether it is deterioration, mitigation, the outbreak of war, or the continuation of survival, will undoubtedly become the focus of some disputes.</p>
<p>Judging from the various signs at present, that optimistic view also has its considerable basis: First, Japan's actions in French Vietnam this time were aimed at the existence of the remaining atmosphere of international appeasement, making a heavy-to-light speculation. The active retaliatory measures taken by the Mingzhi countries in recent times have almost completely exceeded expectations. Second, although the economic sanctions imposed by the United States this time are said to be severe, they have never been without some flexibility, so as to leave the Japanese side with room for repentance. The retaliatory measures taken by the Japanese side are also obviously shifted depending on the severity of the United Kingdom and the United States. As long as one side does not go too far, the other side will probably not force each other too much. Third, in recent times, the international situation is suitable for the ebb of aggression. The Nazis have been trapped in the quagmire of the western Soviet Union, and Italy is even more crouched and trapped on the shores of the Mediterranean. They only hope to get help from the Far East, but they are absolutely unable to support their Far Eastern allies. In the Mingzhi camp and the Soviet Union, their strength has increased, they are seeking cooperation, and they are taking strict precautions in every corner of the world. This is by no means a good opportunity for speculative adventure, and it is the end of aggressive crimes. The aggressor's intention has always been to avoid the heavy and take the light, and to gain without labor. If they know that there is a trap in front of them that can be wiped out, they may not just advance blindly and bring disaster on themselves. Even if there is really no other way to go in front of them, and they are unwilling to retreat, then they must first stop and consider.</p>
<p>Based on this view, can our end assert that the Far Eastern situation is externally stretched and internally relaxed? But it is not. The future trend completely depends on the evolution of the international situation and the comparison of the strength of the two sides. The center of the current problem is not what Japan will do, but whether the countermeasures of the Mingzhi countries are strict and strong enough. The matter of concern is not the recklessness of some radical elements in Japan, but the lingering sense of survival and optimism in the Mingzhi countries. The European war may not from now on go smoothly to the successful completion of the Mingzhi countries. The aggressive front will not silently rest in adversity, but will fight like a trapped beast in order to save its bad luck. Then, even if Japan now has the greatest patience and does not act recklessly at the moment to avoid stimulating the Mingzhi countries, it must do its best to use and digest the rights and interests it has already seized, and complete its so-called high national defense and the "co-prosperity sphere" of the occupied areas of China and Japan, Manchuria, and Vietnam from the Mingzhi countries' renewed slackness. Then, if there is any accidental change or reversal in the European situation, it can be asserted that its impact on the Far East is by no means a peaceful scene. On the north side, there is a neutral guarantee with the Soviet Union. On the south side, continuous springboards have been built from Taiwan, Hainan Island, to Saigon. If it is said that we can live in peace for a long time under this situation, that is an extremely dangerous view.</p>
<p>For example: If China's counterattack strength has not reached maturity, and there is still a lack of cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union regarding the Far East, strategically, in addition to the extremely distant Singapore, Surabaya, Darwin Port, Pearl Harbor, and Dutch Harbor, there is no closer naval and air base more suitable for combat in the Chinese Sea or the Sea of Japan. These are all weaknesses that need to be improved urgently. Moreover, after the Dutch East Indies took active measures regarding economic sanctions, it also needs stronger support from Britain and the United States. If the United States' intention to leave little room for economic sanctions is to buy time to prepare for a perfect plan, then our end has nothing to say. But if it is only based on another view and expects the relaxation of the Far Eastern situation or the aggressor's repentance, it is impossible not to prompt the relevant parties to make further review and understanding of the potential Far Eastern crisis.</p>

<p>Hong Kong - Hong Kong and Japanese leaders talked. The Hong Kong government has frozen Japanese funds in Hong Kong, and Japanese business will inevitably come to a complete standstill. Japanese people may have to end their business and return to Japan because of this. However, there are still more than 600 Japanese nationals in Hong Kong, and the staff of the Japanese Consulate are continuing to work and will not withdraw until they receive instructions from Tokyo. The Japanese bank has not yet learned the detailed measures taken by the Hong Kong government to freeze Japanese funds, so it visited the Secretary of Administration on the 28th to discuss everything. In addition, the Japanese ships Nagatogawa Maru and 断田丸 have also been ordered to stop coming to Hong Kong. (30th)</p>
<p>Beiping - The Japanese military authorities began taking steps yesterday to "protect" British and American commercial firms in Qingdao, Yantai, Saiyang, and Dalian. Since Japan's retaliatory action against the freezing of Japanese funds by Britain and the United States, nervousness has appeared among foreigners. British and American people have been withdrawing their deposits from foreign banks. The value of one US dollar is 9.3 yuan in United Reserve Bank banknotes. Wuchang Bank has refused to buy and sell foreign exchange, while Chinese and Japanese banks have frozen British and American funds. Citibank, in view of the difficulty of mail and other transportation, did not dare to buy checks and advised ticket holders to wait and see. According to reliable unconfirmed sources, the Shenyang branch of HSBC was controlled by the Japanese yesterday. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>The English Great American Evening News said that on the morning of the 30th, it was heard that the Japanese had sent troops to station at the Asia Petroleum Company's oil depot in Qingdao. The company's Shanghai office received a telegram learning of this matter, saying that the Japanese authorities notified the company that Japanese soldiers were "guaranteeing" the oil depot because the Chinese people were "angry" at the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Japanese side "protected" British and American commercial firms in Qingdao and other ports. However, after being "protected" by the British and American commercial firms, their business was greatly hindered. It was heard that the oil head HSBC Bank had been surrounded by the Japanese patrol team, and depositors were not allowed to enter the bank. In Qingdao and Yantai, the patrol teams composed of Japanese soldiers and civilians were also quite rampant, cutting off the offices of British and American banks, Mobil Oil Company, Asia Petroleum Company, and British and American Tobacco Company. Chinese people who entered were searched and interrogated, resulting in very little business for the banks and companies. It was heard that the Japanese side's protests to Britain and the United States were all answered that they were implementing preventive measures to protect British and American commercial firms to prevent "angry Chinese people from causing trouble." The Shanghai branch of the company denied the saying that the Texaco Company's oil depot in the city had been harmed, but said that the Japanese side had sent guards to the oil depot. The offices of the Texaco Company in various ports had not been interfered with. It was also rumored that HSBC had closed its offices in Qingdao and Yantai, but Shanghai has not been able to confirm this statement.</p>

<p>Chongqing - The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance stated last night that the freezing of Chinese funds is different from the freezing of Japanese funds, because Chinese funds can still be entrusted to designated banks for legitimate use.

<p>United Press International, Bangkok, 30th - The government yesterday released a public statement clarifying Thailand's foreign policy as follows: (1) Maintain equal friendship with all nations; (2) Not accept any military or economic pressure from any nation; (3) Not have the slightest worry due to foreign military aggression against it; (4) Do everything possible to maintain Thailand's own peace and not participate in any foreign disputes; (5) Engage in commerce with all nations.</p>
<p>Close and Amicable Anglo-Thai Relations</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 30th -</p>
<p>Bangkok Radio recently broadcast a special announcement regarding the alleged threats Thailand is facing, stating that Thailand completely trusts Britain and has no fear of it. Anglo-Thai relations are actually closer and more amicable than at any time in history. From both an economic and military perspective, Britain has absolutely no reason to threaten Thailand. British military deployments in the Far East are entirely natural and are merely defensive measures. Furthermore, Britain has always notified the Thai government of any deployments, demonstrating Britain's candid attitude. Thailand recently entered into a non-aggression pact with Britain, and Britain has never violated this agreement. As for Japan, it has not threatened Thailand in any way and has no reason to take such actions either economically or militarily. Even if Japan intended to advance southward, there would be no reason for it to pass through Thailand, as this would merely take Japan on a longer route. Japan is a peace-loving nation and has always aspired to elevate the status of Asia and ensure that all Asian nations enjoy full independence. If Japan were to destroy Thailand's independence, who in the world would respect it?</p>
<h3 id="e16">First Batch of Japanese Army Landed in Saigon Yesterday; Occupancy of Cam Ranh Bay Naval Base Begins, Limiting the Number of Vessels <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Saigon, 30th (Urgent) - Two transport ships, fully loaded with the first contingent of Japanese troops to land in Saigon, arrived this morning. The first entered the port at 6:30 AM, and the second at 6:45 AM. Both were filled with Japanese soldiers. As the two ships approached the Southern Government Wharf, about two hundred Japanese expatriates waved Japanese flags and shouted "Long live the Emperor!" to welcome the two transport ships.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - On Monday at dawn, Japanese troops landed at Nha Trang, one of the bases stipulated in the agreement. During the Japanese landing, French and Japanese aircraft flew over the city. Saigon will be taken over by Japanese troops on Tuesday. Transport ships protected by destroyers have anchored off Saint Jacques Island at the entrance to Saigon. The other bases handed over to the Japanese include Tourane, Soc Trang, Bien Hoa, Da Nang, Lai Thieu, Cap St. Jacques, Siem Reap, and other places. Japanese air forces will be stationed at airfields along the eastern coast of Vietnam and near the Gulf of Siam on the Thai-Vietnamese border.</p>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 30th - The Japanese occupation forces have begun to garrison and fortify Cam Ranh Bay.</p>
<p>United Press International, Saigon, 30th - Six transport ships filled with Japanese soldiers arrived this morning as Japanese troops began occupying southern Vietnam. Authoritative sources anticipate that nine more ships carrying Japanese troops will arrive this afternoon. Two of the six transport ships were anchored before 7:00 AM, and the remaining four entered the port later. When the two Japanese ships arrived, the red sun had not yet risen. Members of the Japanese delegation were already at the wharf to greet them. A Japanese destroyer was anchored about one mile away from where the two ships were moored. Many buildings belonging to British and French businesses have been requisitioned to house Japanese soldiers, but it is said that the Japanese authorities will continue to pay rent to the owners.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 30th - Now that it has been officially announced that 40,000 Japanese troops have begun landing in southern Vietnam and that eight airfields have been handed over to the Japanese, it is possible to recount recent events in French Indochina. First and foremost, the agreement was concluded during direct negotiations between Vichy and Tokyo, with only the details of its implementation being discussed in Hanoi. It is reported that Japanese Ambassador Kato and Daru held a decisive meeting on July 19th, and the agreement was signed in Vichy last Tuesday. Governor-General Decoux of Indochina met three times with Cheng Tian, the head of the Japanese military mission, on Wednesday evening before agreeing on the implementation of the agreement. Subsequently, the Japanese acted swiftly, and newspapers published carefully worded announcements to inform the Vietnamese people of the evolving situation. Cheng Tian flew from Hanoi to Saigon on Saturday, leaving only a small number of staff to represent the Japanese mission in Hanoi. The agreement does not mention naval concessions, but it is generally expected that a limited number of Japanese warships will be allowed to anchor in Cam Ranh Bay, Saigon, and Cap St. Jacques. Officials have not confirmed this. Although Cam Ranh Bay is one of the best natural harbors in the world, its port facilities are limited. While Vietnam insists that it does not threaten any country, newspapers and radio stations here have repeatedly mentioned "joint defense" of Vietnam and have engaged in anti-British propaganda in recent days, suggesting that the focus of general concern in Vietnam's position has shifted to Saigon and its surrounding areas, where troops are being redeployed for "defense." At the same time, the Boundary Commission is finalizing the details of Vietnam's recent cession of territory to Thailand. The former German consul in Vietnam arrived in Saigon yesterday to participate in the Boundary Commission's discussions. Hanoi insists that the facilities granted to Japan in southern Vietnam are purely tactical, and the terms of the Japanese-Vietnamese economic agreement are being faithfully implemented.</p>
<p>Japan's Second Step Will Be to Invade Thailand</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 30th - Well-informed diplomatic sources believe that Japan's second step after occupying Vietnam will be to gain a foothold in Thailand. If this step is also successful for Japan, it will not only gain a base from which to threaten the滇緬路, the lifeline of China, but also be closer to the oilfields of Burma. Some believe that Japan has already begun to make indirect overtures to the Thai government, seeking to obtain political, domestic, and economic footholds in Thailand, just as it has done in Vietnam. Part of this attempt involves claiming that Thailand has been threatened by the British navy, army, and air force. At the same time, military and diplomatic observers are also speculating about Japan's demands for air force bases in Siem Reap, Cap Deng, and Phnom Penh. Siem Reap is adjacent to the Thai border, and the other locations are also near the border. Most experts believe that whether Japan intends to attack Thailand or Singapore, it will take three months to equip its bases in Vietnam before taking such steps. They also say that while Cam Ranh Bay is a natural harbor, it is far from being a modern naval port, and Saigon's dry docks can only accommodate small ships such as destroyers.</p>
<p>Tokyo Reports Japan Ends Southern Advance</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Well-informed Japanese sources say that the Japanese government is satisfied with the benefits it has obtained under the Franco-Japanese agreement of July 21st and does not intend to advance further south, but only if Britain and the United States accept the fait accompli. On the contrary, if those countries continue to encircle Japan in the South Pacific and reimpose oil embargoes, Japan will have no choice but to immediately consider preventive measures to avoid being economically suffocated. In other words, if Britain and the United States are willing to continue pursuing a "big stick" policy, then Japan can also use the big stick in retaliation. To prevent such a situation and to protect the transportation lines between Japan and Vietnam, which is Japan's "rice road," the Japanese government should first establish the necessary land, sea, and air force bases in Vietnam. As for the French civil officials in Vietnam, they should be allowed to exercise their powers freely and avoid disputes with them. In short, Japan originally hoped to maintain peace in the Pacific, but the best way to do so is not to follow a path of compromise but to demonstrate its strength. Japan, in this spirit, believes that once the psychological impact of the freeze order has subsided, it can establish a temporary arrangement with the United States, so that it retains considerable freedom of action and, when the opportunity arises, can begin to advance in any other direction.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Japanese Fishing Boats Serving as Spies: Nineteen Impounded in Hawaii This Spring <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th - Today, the US Treasury Department announced the impoundment of nineteen Japanese fishing boats in Hawaii this spring. Although the fishing boats were impounded by customs officials for false registration, responsible officials in Washington believe that these fishing boats were being used for espionage, as each boat had sophisticated radio and photographic equipment and nautical charts unrelated to fishing. It is believed that each fishing boat had at least one member of the Japanese navy on board. According to this information, the fishing boats were registered under the names of American companies, but investigations revealed that their true owners were Japanese. A judge ruled that they had violated international law and imposed penalties on three Honolulu fishing companies and seventeen Japanese fishermen.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Situation in South Pacific: US Believes It Is Gradually Becoming Optimistic; Also Prepared to Accept Wagers; Anglo-Soviet Far East Alliance Possible <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 30th - Undersecretary of State Welles made an informal statement to the press yesterday, saying that recent developments are the result of Axis countries attempting to disrupt peace in the Western Hemisphere and "extend their control over the affairs of American republics." Welles spoke after meeting with President Roosevelt. He reported to the President on the international situation, especially regarding the Far East. President Roosevelt also discussed Far East affairs with the "Big Four" of Congress.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th - President Roosevelt returned to Washington this morning from Hyde Park and will soon meet with government leaders to discuss aid to Britain and the Soviet Union and the situation in Japan.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 30th - Churchill's report in the House of Commons and the negotiations of the Soviet military delegation here yesterday gave rise to a calm optimism regarding peace in the South Pacific. Although the Japanese press has attacked the alleged encirclement by democratic countries, this optimism is still very apparent. The so-called "encirclement" propagated by the Japanese is generally regarded as a possible preparation for Japanese military action to change Japan's position. Neutral observers doubt that Japan would take hasty action at a time when the world situation is turning in favor of Britain and the United States. One authoritative source said that the possibility of a Japanese military response is fully recognized by all. Unofficial sources here say that the Dutch East Indies also recognize the possibility of Japanese action. However, it is widely believed that the United States and Britain are prepared to accept such a risk. Furthermore, high-ranking officials here are under the impression that Japanese leaders will not rashly place a wager on the Dutch East Indies or Singapore when Britain's position and the future of the Soviet Union are still favorable.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Defense of Malaya Consolidated <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Singapore, 30th - The general situation here remains virtually unchanged, but there are only various signs indicating that preparations are being taken a step further, and the determination to defend the Malay Peninsula in the event of any event is even stronger. However, most residents here believe that this may not happen. Astute observers also believe that there is an urgent need to take a stronger retaliatory action against any additional Japanese actions. Residents of Singapore do not show signs of panic, but only express disappointment that the economic sanctions imposed by Britain and the United States on Japan are too lenient. Chinese and British newspapers here urge the implementation of the most stringent British and American retaliatory plans against Japan, even if it means severing trade relations with Japan. The Straits Times said that democratic countries should completely cut off trade relations with Japan, as they do with Germany. Well-informed sources say that current intelligence, such as Washington's rapid clearance of Japanese ships and London's statement that restrictions will be enforced leniently, actually exposes countless weaknesses, allowing Japan to resist the freeze order. Defense leaders here now seem to believe that there is no need for further explanation of the recently issued official announcement. The recent announcement entirely described the state of the local army and navy. Apart from Saturday's freeze order, the municipal authorities have not issued any additional national defense regulations. Residents here generally believe that even if Japan continues to advance southward, Malaya will not be affected, because any invasion of Malaya will be the most costly, as Malaya's defenses are impenetrable, especially its air force. Invaders will certainly lose more than they gain. However, everyone agrees that there is no end to strengthening defenses. Therefore, not only should the defenses of Malaya itself be constantly strengthened, but also the defenses of the outer perimeter, such as Borneo and Sarawak, should be strengthened. The British are also deeply aware of the value of maintaining the autonomy of Thailand and the Dutch East Indies, as the above-mentioned two places are strong forward defenses of Malaya. Sarawak's official gazette announced yesterday that additional defensive measures include declaring Kuching and Miri as defense zones and establishing a special coastal defense post. Malayan national defense leaders are also openly discussing extending defenses from Burma to Borneo, not only in terms of air force bases, but also by reinforcing coastal batteries with the most powerful artillery units. It is reported that elite British troops are distributed throughout the peninsula and have now become an army of experienced forest warriors. One team recently completed a 100-mile march, traversing the forest in eight days without incident. Malaya's indestructible air force conducts partial exercises every day. Teams of high-speed fighters and heavy bombers roar over the city every day in formation. As the reporter writes this article, twenty-one American-made "Brewster Buffalo" fighters are roaring over the commercial district. Furthermore, all Malayan troops have received special instructions to defend against paratroopers, and rifles have been issued to both officers and soldiers. At the same time, the army and navy have gradually established regular troops to replace the personnel stationed at the Far East naval stations. Soldiers who have participated in Dunkirk, Benghazi, Greece, and Crete have all been incorporated into Malaya's defense forces. At the same time, well-informed sources observe that if Japan wants to invade Thailand or the Dutch East Indies, it will face enormous difficulties, and Japan is well aware of this. Therefore, as long as democratic countries still hold the upper hand in Europe, they will never want to invade other countries.</p>

<p>United Press International, London, 30th - British Foreign Secretary Eden recently gave a speech in the House of Commons, accusing Japan of exacerbating tensions in Anglo-Japanese relations.

<p>United Press International, Manila, 30th - Lieutenant General MacArthur announced today that he is drafting a general plan to unify all troops in the Philippines. At the same time, civil defense authorities announced that a preliminary evacuation drill will be held on August 3rd. This evacuation test will move residents of Manila's densely populated working-class areas to San Mateo, fifty miles inland. This decisive exercise will give Manila's volunteer police and the Red Cross, as well as other civil defense organizations, the opportunity for preliminary practical mobilization. US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre and MacArthur met this morning to discuss policies regarding the Far East military. MacArthur also met with President Quezon twice to discuss the plan.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th - Dutch Minister Loudon told reporters last night while waiting to meet with Undersecretary of State Welles that in the event of an extreme emergency, the Netherlands would effectively destroy the oil wells and refineries in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch have already taken all measures and can implement them immediately to ensure the thorough destruction of the oil fields and refineries. "If we are forced to do so, we will destroy the oil industry in the Dutch East Indies without hesitation," he said. Loudon and Welles met to discuss developments in the Far East, especially the threats faced by the Dutch East Indies. Loudon refused to comment on the general situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 30th - Regarding reports that the Dutch East Indies has abolished the 1940 gasoline agreement, responsible sources here say that no such agreement actually exists. As for a certain agreement concluded between Japan and various oil companies in the Dutch East Indies, it became invalid on Sunday due to US dollar payment terms.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 30th - The Japanese Domei News Agency said that officials claimed that private contracts between Japanese oil buyers and British, American, or Dutch oil producers will be fulfilled in accordance with the usual license system.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 30th - Newspapers in the Dutch East Indies welcome the Dutch East Indies' joint economic sanctions against Japan with Britain and the United States, saying that the scope of the Dutch East Indies' future implementation of the license system will naturally depend on how Britain and the United States handle it. If oil supplies are completely blocked, Japan will first attack the Dutch East Indies to obtain its needs. The Dutch East Indies will resist in any case, even if it has to fight alone. However, the policy of the Dutch East Indies will ultimately be dominated by the question of whether Britain and the United States are prepared to actively aid the Dutch East Indies and share its hardships. The stock market was not affected by the Dutch East Indies' actions against Japan. British and American stocks remained stable, while trading in Japanese stocks was sluggish. The Japanese business community did not show signs of panic, but rather adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th - An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun said that the Dutch East Indies should regard its commercial relations with Japan as purely economic events and should not follow Britain and the United States. However, the Dutch East Indies may no longer have the hope of reconsidering its attitude, so Japan must not harbor this hope. The newspaper also carried an article pointing out that the Dutch East Indies is wearing the skin of a British tiger and inserting the feathers of an American eagle to resist Japan. It also said that the Dutch East Indies has always been a source of supply for Japan, not just a Japanese market. Since this is the case, Japan must actively utilize Vietnam, Siam, and South China.</p>
<p>British Unease About Weak Sanctions Against Japan</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 30th - Some people are very uneasy because the actions of Britain and the United States in sanctioning Japan have not been strictly implemented. British experts believe that Britain and the United States will still allow people to engage in some amount of trade with Japan, and that American oil shipments to Japan will not decrease greatly immediately. The experts also pointed out that the Dutch East Indies is facing the danger of a Japanese attack, and without the support of Britain and the United States, it may not dare to resolutely stop oil shipments to Japan. The feeling of unease can be seen in an editorial in the Standard Evening News. The newspaper said that Japan has previously seen Washington and London issue strong statements first and then follow up with not very strong actions. Japan has long understood these actions. The newspaper warned that the Japanese troops occupying Vietnam have threatened Thailand and the Burma Road. Japanese aircraft and the troops they transport can strike the Burma Road and invade British territory or the Soviet Union. If China's fighting power is damaged, it will be a very unfortunate blow to us British.</p>
<p>Japanese Anxiety Over Lack of Oil</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th - The Dutch East Indies' termination of oil agreements with Japan has aroused the greatest concern throughout Japan. Since no official detailed reports have been received, it is not yet clear whether this decision by the Dutch East Indies is temporary, partial, or absolute. However, if the United States takes the same action, it will place Japan in an extremely difficult situation. This issue is particularly serious, because the need for oil is known to all Japanese people and is indispensable, unlike the freezing of funds, which is just another form of wartime control. The Japanese people consider the Dutch East Indies' action to be extremely reckless. The Japanese people have been shown the need for oil through strict restrictions on private consumption and the extreme savings in the use of oil by public vehicles. The Japanese people have already said about the termination of oil, "This action is too much. How can Japan have no oil?" Officials also expressed anxiety about this. The Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said, "If no oil comes from the United States, we must make a great determination to deal with this problem. Japan should promote domestic oil production on the one hand and prohibit civilian use of oil on the other." A reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun met with the oil industry, who said that the seriousness of the situation depends on the extent to which the Dutch East Indies restricts oil shipments to Japan. This point is still unclear. However, Japan had anticipated this action and stored oil, so its immediate consequences may not be too serious, but the mining oil company to be established on September 1 should be utilized to the greatest extent.</p>

<p>United Press International, London, 30th - Reports received by foreign officials here say that the Soviet Union has explored whether Japan's neutrality during the German-Soviet war should be affirmed. It is also said that Moscow hopes that Japan's new Foreign Minister Toyota will clarify the issue of neutrality and that it must be in line with the Japanese-Soviet neutrality agreement. According to an unconfirmed report from another source, Japan has expressed its willingness to accept this request, but the Soviet Union must agree to the following conditions: (1) demilitarize Vladivostok; (2) affirm Soviet military action in the Far East.</p>

<p>Reuters, Guangzhou, 30th - The Japanese Consul-General issued a notice today that the regulations imposed by Japan on the transactions between British and American expatriates and Japanese people have been implemented in Guangzhou since Sunday. It is heard that the Guangdong government will also implement parallel actions against Chinese people, but this statement has not been verified.</p>
<p>Reuters, Taipei, 30th - Since the Japanese government took freezing action, the Governor-General of Taiwan today ordered that regulations on the transactions of foreign nationals residing in Taiwan be implemented immediately. Those affected by this regulation include people from the United States, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands, and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th - According to the Japanese Kōchi Shimbun, it is heard that foreign nationals whose assets have been frozen can withdraw 500 Japanese yen per month to pay for rent, servants, and taxes without obtaining a permit.

However, large Japanese trading companies overseas are also suffering in the same way. Now everything must be endured until the effects of the new order become apparent.</p>

All kinds of goods in foreign trade, except those patented by the government, will be controlled by the association. After the establishment of the agency, the Manchukuo Importers Association and the Kwantung Foreign Trade Cooperative will be automatically abolished.</p>

When asked if oil shipments would be further restricted, the President replied that it was best not to discuss the matter at this time. When asked if he considered the current Far Eastern situation to be more serious for American interests than the European crisis, the President again evaded the question, stating that he did not think the question had much meaning, as he did not compare the situations in Europe and Asia. When asked for his opinion on Japan's occupation of southern Vietnam, the President again refused to discuss it.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Oxford University During Wartime <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>So, what is student life like in wartime colleges? Their training is naturally more difficult, dull, and arduous than normal. Several Oxford colleges have been entirely requisitioned by the state. Other colleges have also had a portion of them participate in government administrative work. The students of these colleges have all been partially or completely merged into neighboring colleges.</p>
<p>Students not only routinely lodge in different colleges, but also endure unprecedented hardships in their studies and a reduction in leisure activities. They are working at full speed, trying to complete nine terms of coursework in five. At the same time, physically fit students are all assigned to the Senior Training Corps, which requires at least six or seven hours of drill per week.</p>
<p>Students feel the threat of war, and the nation is on the verge of life and death. They no longer have the usual leisurely mood to go to clubs, attend concerts, watch plays, or debate (although Oxford students' debates continue to be held), nor do they have the time to read leisure books and chat. Many colleges have jointly selected the remaining athletes to form sports teams, but the duration of competitions has been limited. Teachers acknowledge that students are generally working too hard and could use some rest. However, in today's world, everyone is restless; who dares to enjoy pleasure before the rest of the world?</p>
<p>However, Oxford students are quite content with their hardships, and even secretly welcome them because of the reduced expenses. Most Oxford students come from poor backgrounds. Since the government's large-scale distribution of subsidies and the increase in the number of local scholarships, a clear distinction has emerged between the rich and the poor among students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. While there are certainly many wealthy playboys, the majority are still from humble backgrounds.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Oxford has stipulated a daily fee of twelve cents per student, which includes accommodation, electricity, porterage, and food. Adding tuition and miscellaneous fees, each student only needs to pay fifty to sixty pounds per term, and the estimated budget for each student for the three terms in a year is two hundred to two hundred and twenty-five pounds. Some colleges provide free meals or other preferential treatment to help impoverished students, while the students take on air defense duties in their spare time as a way to repay the favor.</p>
<p>Most of the faculty members have not been mobilized and are quite comfortable. Younger ones have of course been drafted, and older ones have joined government work. Others are gradually leaving. However, the core talent remains strong, and many respected professors from before the war continue to bring honor to the university.</p>
<p>Famous lecturers such as Zimmern, Holdsworth, Charles Omen, Dabid Ross, and Sirs Murray, Coupland, Hodgkin, Powicke, Adams, Gordon, and Nichol Smith are all lecturing as usual, and students eager to learn can listen to their insightful lectures. In short, the university's curriculum is as rich and comprehensive as ever.</p>
<p>On winter evenings, in the senior fellows' common room, a warm coal fire burns, and behind the light-shielding curtains, the light reflects on the portraits of many distinguished predecessors. The joyous atmosphere is as it always was. Although there may not be many cakes or water to drink, the wine always tastes refreshing, and what is most captivating is everyone's lively conversation and witty remarks. In Balliol College, one can often find scholars who have fled from all over Europe, escaping from the universities destroyed by the Axis powers. Among them, there are many who have worked hard, such as Madariaga of Spain, who is unmatched by other scholars.</p>
<p>The Oxford University Press, one of the leading publishers in the world, continues to publish monumental works. It does not hesitate to publish an award-winning academic work in this chaotic era. This is Bartley's "Crossroads of the Caucasus," beautifully printed in two massive volumes, selling for six gold coins. Although museums like the Ashmolean have placed their most precious items in safe locations, a constant stream of treasures continues to arrive. A collection of modern French art donated by the late Henry Smith is a rare treasure of the era, adding much to Oxford's luster.</p>
<p>While Europe is shrouded in the clouds of war and has become almost entirely dark, Oxford's academic lamp continues to shine brightly. This university, with its seven-hundred-year history, continues to shoulder two great missions for humanity. One is to follow in the footsteps of its predecessors, to study diligently and teach effectively, and to strive for truth, scholarship, and culture. When most of European civilization is being ravaged, it stands firm, taking it upon itself to uphold the highest principles of human life. On the other hand, the university is mobilizing for a war of humanity and national defense, doing everything in its power to nurture young scholars, accelerate their graduation, and send them to the front lines. Every student knows that military service is imminent and that they have an immediate obligation to sacrifice themselves for their country.</p>
<p>Sporadic news of classmates being drafted is constantly coming from the Oxford colleges. Some of this news is too terrible to bear. One was taken prisoner in Germany, another died in Libya, another suffered misfortune in Dunkirk, and yet another was killed in action in the North Sea. Although the number of deaths is not as high as in 1914-1918, it is continuing to increase.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Four Nations of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States Form a Strong Anti-Aggression Front: British Foreign Secretary Eden Declares No Peace Until Hitler's Regime and Ideology are Destroyed <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th—British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in a speech at a luncheon for foreign journalists yesterday that he preemptively rejected any peace proposals from Hitler, saying that China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain were a formidable obstacle to aggression. There is a new tone in Hitler's propaganda. Hitler has broken countless promises, but now he has changed and wants to fulfill his promise to the German people that the war will end this year, with either German victory or peace. Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union was intended to fulfill this promise, but his timing has failed. Soviet resistance was unexpected, and soon he will launch a peace blitzkrieg against us. I have recently stated on behalf of the British government that we are not prepared to negotiate with Hitler at any time or on any issue, because there can be no peace with such a person. If there were, it would only give him time to repair his war machine and allow the German people to catch their breath and stage a comeback. His so-called peace is nothing more than a hypocritical façade. What value is there in the promises given by such a person? A peace treaty concluded with such a person is only valid during the period of his planning for aggression. All countries must be prepared for war and cannot demobilize. Our factories will continue to produce armaments, matching those secretly manufactured and stockpiled by Hitler, to prevent a second war for world domination from occurring. Hitler is not a rare, temporary figure in German history, but a representative of the current German aspirations and character, which have been repeatedly manifested in its history. If we want peace in our time, then we must make the German people abandon not only Hitler but also the teachings given by their rulers for the past century. Therefore, we are not interested in any peace proposals that Hitler and his government may offer. We are determined to destroy Hitler and his regime and ideology. When this war ends in the future, our military responsibility will be to ensure that Germany is no longer in a position to plunge the world into a full-scale war within twenty years. Our peace conditions are aimed at preventing the recurrence of German atrocities. However, while we must have this military plan, we have no intention of causing economic collapse in Germany or other countries. A Germany suffering from hunger and bankruptcy in Europe would be a poison to its neighbors. This statement is not out of emotion but out of common sense. After Germany's defeat, Europe will be in a state of exhaustion. At that time, there will be a great deal of work to be done. Now the United States is helping us defeat Germany, so we hope that the Americans will cooperate with us at that time to maintain the peace we can achieve. We have always believed that a peace system acceptable to the people of all countries can be negotiated in a conference room without our other efforts and greater sacrifices. But we now know it is not so and realize that the price of peace is constant vigilance, preparation, and courage. We must not forget this lesson. While we are vigilant, we must also immediately begin the work of gradually eliminating the causes of enmity. Only when this work gradually takes effect can we gradually relax our vigilance. We are now planning our proposals for future developments. The governments of many allied countries are now gathered in London. I hope that soon we can hold another public conference to record our unified interests. At that time, we can begin to study the difficult problems that peace will bring. If we can obtain the sympathy and cooperation of the United States in this, we will feel that we are building a house on a strong foundation."</p>

<p>United Press, London, 30th—British Foreign Secretary Eden recently stated in the House of Commons, in response to a question from a Member of Parliament asking whether he was aware of the increasing number of so-called German experts and Nazi spies in Iran and whether Britain would protest to Iran about this, that Britain was fully aware of the foreign reports that a coup d'état might occur in Iran as a result of the increasing number of Germans entering the country, and that Britain had already protested to Iran about this. Eden said, "I have asked the Iranian government to seriously consider the fact that continuing to allow Germans to enter the country will endanger Iran's interests. I believe that Iran will heed this warning and take the necessary measures to deal with this situation." When asked if the Soviet Union would take similar action, Eden said, "We are cooperating closely on this matter."</p>

<p>Havas, London, 30th—According to semi-official sources, President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, has arrived in Moscow from London.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th—Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the British government has made much progress in fulfilling its promise of economic assistance to the Soviet Union. A large quantity of goods has now been shipped to the Soviet Union from various parts of the British Empire and other allied countries. On the other hand, the Soviet government has also shipped valuable supplies for the common war effort of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 30th—The White House today declined to comment on the visit of US Defense Program Coordinator Hopkins to Moscow, but senior officials stated that Hopkins' trip may be intended to provide President Roosevelt with the latest information, rather than to indicate a new development in the Lend-Lease Act. Hopkins has long been known as President Roosevelt's eyes and ears in Europe, so his trip is not surprising. Informed sources said that the visit of President Roosevelt's key aide to Moscow will encourage the morale of the Soviet Union.</p>

The content of the protocol attached to this treaty stipulates that the Soviet government will release Polish war prisoners and other prisoners detained in Soviet territory after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Finland Announces Severance of Relations with Britain: Content of Note to Britain <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Helsinki, 30th—According to Finnish foreign sources, when the Finnish Foreign Minister handed the note of severance of diplomatic relations with Britain to the British Minister on Monday, he stated that since Britain's blockade of Finnish foreign trade in June, normal diplomatic relations between Britain and Finland had virtually ceased to exist. Circumstances had forced Finland to join the German side as a belligerent, and Britain had also concluded a military alliance with the Soviet Union, making it difficult to maintain normal diplomatic relations between Britain and Finland without causing disputes. Judging from the statements made in the British House of Commons that British-Finnish relations could be severed at any time, it can be seen that Britain also held this view. Finland has therefore decided that the Finnish embassy in Britain should temporarily cease its activities and now wishes to hear the British government's views on the activities of the British embassy in Helsinki, wondering if it also holds this view.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 30th—The "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in New York cabled that he had recently obtained information that German Air Force Quartermaster General Udet, a confidant of General Göring, had been publicly humiliated for opposing the attack on the Soviet Union. He was later arrested by order of Hitler and committed suicide in anger. Göring had also expressed strong opposition to the invasion of the Soviet Union. Currently, the command of the German Air Force has actually been taken over by Field Marshal Milch. If Göring were not respected by the German people, he would probably have been a prisoner long ago. The source of this news is a secret German report that was leaked. Allied officials attach great importance to it.</p>

<p>Reuters, Ankara, 30th—It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles here that the Soviet Union will soon provide Turkey with another guarantee that the Soviet Union has no ambitions or designs on any part of Turkish territory. This guarantee will be issued in the form of a personal letter from Stalin to the Turkish Prime Minister. This development will greatly improve Soviet-Turkish relations and dispel the misunderstandings and suspicions created by Hitler and Ribbentrop. Furthermore, closer Soviet-Turkish ties will inevitably strengthen Turkey's strategic position, allowing Turkey to focus on defending its western borders.

<h3 id="e48">工部局 Sanitary Department: Supplying Ribbon Mosquito Fish - $50 per Thousand <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the Sanitary Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the department established several fish hatchery ponds in Zhaofeng Park twelve years ago. After diligently researching and experimenting with various types of minnows, they discovered a type of small fish (Gambusia affinis) that could prey on mosquito larvae, significantly aiding in malaria prevention. These mosquito fish originally came from the Philippines and were difficult to survive in winter. The department overcame this challenge through various methods. In the Xuhui district, there are now 145 ponds stocked with these small fish (ponds used for ornamentation). Based on weekly inspections over the past two seasons, it was found that if properly protected, mosquitoes could be virtually eliminated during their pupation or metamorphosis stages. Many private pond owners now recognize the value of mosquito fish in combating mosquito infestations and are actively assisting in fish farming. They are also willing to transfer mosquito fish from overstocked ponds to other ponds.</p>
<p>The Sanitary Department now has three large fish hatchery ponds in the Jiaozhou Park, capable of supplying mosquito fish at a cost of only $50 per thousand. Those wishing to obtain these fish may apply through the Deputy Chief Inspector of the Anti-Malaria Group at telephone number 31076. Anti-Malaria Group staff regularly inspect fish ponds, providing guidance on fish farming methods and winter protection measures.</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Outline of Southern Vietnam <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— By Yi</p>
<p>(Special Correspondence from Hong Kong) French Indochina has four important cities: Haiphong, Hanoi, Phnom Penh, and Saigon. Haiphong and Hanoi experienced significant turmoil last year, ultimately being lent to the Japanese army as bases. Phnom Penh suffered considerable distress during the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. Now, Saigon is facing the same fate as Haiphong and Hanoi!</p>
<p>Among the many cities in French Indochina, Saigon is the one I cannot forget. This is not only because it constantly supplies Shanghai with food but because it is where the French have invested the most effort and is the most important commercial port and naval base in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Of the provinces in Vietnam, Cochinchina was the first to fall into French hands (in 1805). Saigon is the capital of this province. In terms of name, this province also differs from the others. It is a French colony (Clonie), while the other provinces are called protectorates (Proteetorat). The highest administrative officer in this province is called the Governor (Gouverneur), unlike the other provinces where they are called "Resident Superior" (Resident Superienr). This is likely one of the reasons why the French have invested so heavily in this province.</p>
<p>Vietnam is one of the world's three major rice-producing regions. The two regions with the highest rice production are the Tonkin Delta and Cochinchina. Although the northern Tonkin rice-producing region also produces a significant amount of rice, it has a high population density. Therefore, Cochinchina is the only region capable of exporting large quantities of rice. The specialized name of Saigon rice is well-known to every rice consumer.</p>
<p>Southern Vietnam not only produces rice but also rubber, coffee, and other agricultural products. Many French people bought large rice paddies or rubber plantations and became wealthy millionaires within a few years! Rubber was originally a specialty of the South Seas region. However, the cultivation of rubber trees in southern Vietnam has only been a recent development in the last one or two decades. Although Vietnam's rubber production cannot compare to that of the Dutch East Indies and the Malay Archipelago, it certainly surpasses them in terms of quality. After the outbreak of the European war, until Japan recently occupied southern Vietnam, due to difficulties in shipping between France and Vietnam, most of the rice here was sold to various parts of the Far East, such as Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. The rubber was mostly shipped to the United States or to the rubber market in Singapore and then re-exported to Europe and America.</p>
<p>The majority of overseas Chinese in Vietnam are also concentrated in the south, accounting for three-quarters of the total. Six kilometers from Saigon is the city of Cholon, which the French call "Chinatown." More than half of the residents here are our compatriots from Fujian and Guangdong. Some own rice mills, others own inland river transportation companies, and others run various kinds of restaurants and shops. There are also many schools for overseas Chinese. When we first arrived in Saigon, others told us the name of "Chinatown." When we arrived there, we really didn't feel like we were in the French city of Cholon. We almost suspected that we had arrived in our own Guangzhou or Shantou!</p>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese in Saigon, a man named Huang, from Fujian, is the richest man in all of Vietnam. He owns vast amounts of land and many shops and pawnshops. He has several French accountants managing his accounts, and several construction companies are vying to design and contract for him. Recently, they built seven palace-style residences near the racecourse, which they planned to live in themselves. They have probably already moved in.</p>
<p>Like overseas Chinese organizations elsewhere, the overseas Chinese in Saigon also have many "gongs" and "guildhalls" to assist newcomers or sick compatriots and to handle all group organization affairs. There is also a chamber of commerce here, representing many overseas Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>China has consulates in Hanoi, Haiphong, and Saigon. Since the Japanese army landed in Haiphong and Hanoi, the consulates there have temporarily ceased operations and have been entrusted to the US consulate. After the recent events in Saigon, the consulate there has also been closed. Before the armistice between France and Germany, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was the most convenient international transportation route in the southwest provinces. Since the closure of that route, there are still many merchants and goods stranded in Haiphong and Saigon. Not long ago, I heard that the goods in the Haiphong warehouse had been moved. What will happen to Saigon now?</p>
<p>I am very concerned about Vietnam because I lived there for a while. I have many friends there. I know very well the wealth of southern Vietnam, and I am very saddened by the current fate of Vietnam. The French sometimes explain the name Annam as "Peace of the South" (La Paix Du Sud). I hope it never forgets its name! But now it inevitably feels like a storm is about to break.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Legitimate Needs of Importers and Exporters Can Obtain Foreign Exchange, Legal Tender Demand Soars, Status Further Consolidated, Black Market Fluctuations Turned Stable Yesterday <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Since the United States first announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, and the United Kingdom and others took parallel actions, how should import and export trade between any part of China and the United Kingdom, the United States, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies be handled? American banks in this city began to follow the instructions after receiving implementation orders No. 58 and No. 59 from the US Treasury Department the day before yesterday, and began to implement them from the afternoon of the day before yesterday, placing legitimate trade in the Far East under the management of the American license system. In the four days after the 26th, due to the rise of rumors and the manipulation of speculators, the financial market was once very chaotic. By yesterday, it had returned to the right track and stabilized. All legitimate needs of importers and exporters can be applied for and supplied. As the demand for legal tender has increased sharply, its status has become more consolidated, and its value will also rise, so its future is very promising. The various news obtained yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>Applying for Foreign Exchange Requires a Guarantee</p>
<p>Regarding the method of applying for the supply of foreign exchange, according to a senior official of the Chartered Bank speaking to a Ta Chung News Agency reporter, it must be guaranteed by the banking sector that the applicant is indeed a legitimate business and for legitimate purposes, not for Japan, and not transferred to countries outside of China. Those qualified to provide guarantees are fourteen foreign banks and foreign firms. It is unclear whether Chinese banks can provide guarantees. However, it is said that the authorities of various Chinese banks held a meeting last night (the 29th) to discuss how to maintain legitimate foreign trade for Chinese businesses. As for the agreement of the Foreign Banks Association in this port, there was no concrete result. It was decided to implement the methods promulgated by the governments of various countries. Yesterday, US dollar depositors at American banks could still withdraw as usual without restrictions. Citibank also bought and sold US exchange as usual, as in the past. However, an employee of the import and export department of HSBC said that at present, bills of exchange from merchants in China and Japan are no longer accepted, and the news seems to be very contradictory.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Black Market Becomes More Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai foreign exchange "black market" quotes at the British HSBC bank did not differ much from the previous market. The transaction rates were 3 pence and 171875 for British exchange and 5 yuan and 21875 for US exchange, both of which were slightly higher than the previous market by 0.03125. Therefore, the foreign exchange "black market" in this city has turned stable and there is no longer the phenomenon of sudden tightening and loosening of the past. If each bank already has foreign exchange positions, it can still freely buy and sell foreign exchange. Yesterday, it was learned from the banking sector in this city that in the future, only essential goods for China can obtain legitimate and proper foreign exchange. However, luxury goods and the like will find it increasingly difficult to request the supply of foreign exchange. As for general speculators who want to profit from buying and selling foreign exchange, in fact, it is no longer as convenient as in the past. Therefore, the Shanghai exchange market in the future will be able to maintain stability for a long time, and legitimate merchants and various legitimate businesses will not be affected in any way. However, speculators have obviously suffered a serious blow.</p>
<p>The Current Freeze is Not Thorough</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Ta Chung News Agency visited a famous person in the financial sector to inquire about his impressions of these two implementation orders. According to him, the US freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds has no impact on legitimate commercial activities. Because in terms of the content of the implementation orders, although there are various restrictions, they are flexible. It is well known that Washington only wishes to place trade between the United States and the Far East under the management of the US government. According to bankers' explanations, Chinese and Japanese people who have US exchange in the future can still withdraw it. Not only legitimate Chinese merchants, but also legitimate Japanese merchants doing business in China, can still apply for the supply of foreign exchange without restrictions. This is the biggest loophole in the freezing order. If Japanese merchants use the method of substitution, there is no way to resist it. Therefore, it is suspected that there is still appeasement at work. It is hoped that the fourteen banks can have thorough resistance methods in terms of technology.</p>
<p>The Credit of Legal Tender Increases More and More</p>
<p>According to the Russian newspaper, since Japanese funds were frozen, the following reactions have occurred: (1) US exchange and Japanese yen have both been tightened and restricted. Only the position of Chinese legal tender is not affected, and its credit value will increase. (2) It is expected that speculators will not be able to obtain foreign exchange in the future, and the black market will be severely hit. The exchange market in this port can tend to stabilize. (3) Normal Chinese trade can still purchase foreign exchange with legal tender. The funds of free China will become more abundant. (4) Japanese foreign trade is limited to the yen group, and will inevitably become more and more depressed in the future.</p>

<p>Recently, the Republic of Panama discovered that its ships were running late, so it sent its ambassador to Japan, Mr. Frayre, to Shanghai to investigate. Mr. Frayre has now arrived in Shanghai and will stay for several days. His wife and son are also traveling with him. Mr. Frayre said that all parts of the world are suffering from the effects of the war, but the daily commerce of Shanghai seems to be prosperous. Shanghai has long been called the New York of the Far East, and he believes that this statement is indeed true.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 30th) from 9 to 11 am, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces held military exercises in the northern district of Hongkou, causing several streets in the area to be blocked. However, the bridges over the Suzhou Creek remained open, and traffic on the northern shore was normal.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Export Trade About to Cease, Number of Prohibited Goods Increases, Yesterday Increased to Fifteen Categories, Totaling Twenty-Seven Kinds <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Since the customs embargo launched by the Japanese side in retaliation for the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by the UK and the US came into effect on the 28th, the scope has become increasingly broad. The prohibited export commodities have increased from eight to eleven types. Yesterday, Mr. Oyamada, the Japanese tax officer of the General Affairs Department of the Customs, issued another notice, revising the list of prohibited goods. As a result, the number of prohibited export commodities has increased to as many as fifteen types. The export trade of the UK, the US, and other friendly countries in this port is in a state of near standstill due to the daily changes and instability in the types of prohibited goods. Yesterday, merchants from various countries in Shanghai came to the Customs one after another to request the clearance and export of goods, but the results were all disappointing. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Prohibited Goods Increased to Fifteen Categories</p>
<p>Mr. Oyamada Tamitsu, the Japanese tax officer of the General Affairs Department of the Customs, issued a revised embargo notice at 11:30 am yesterday, saying, "The following goods are temporarily prohibited from being transported (including transit and re-export) to foreign countries (excluding Japan) or Chinese ports (excluding occupied areas): (1) Raw and tanned leather (excluding fur and leather clothing); (2) Bran (including rice bran and wheat bran); (3) Rice and grains; (4) Wheat and flour; (5) Pigments, dyes, paints, coatings, enamels, colorants, etc.; (6) Vegetable oils and vegetable foods; (7) Rubber (excluding manufactured products); (8) Coal; (9) Cotton and cotton wool; (10) Hemp, flax, ramie; (11) Wool; (12) Various mineral sands; (13) Various hardware; (14) Machinery; (15) Medical and industrial chemicals (excluding botanical chemicals)." The above fifteen categories, totaling twenty-seven types, are all prohibited from being exported.</p>
<p>To Be Controlled and Manipulated by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The above notice excludes the previously designated embargoed grains, fertilizers, and cotton fabrics. It is learned that the Japanese tax officer of the Customs will no longer issue notices to stop the embargo on the above three items, because the previously issued notice has been repealed. All items other than the fifteen categories of embargoed goods in yesterday's announcement are allowed to be cleared for export. According to well-informed sources, almost all of the fifteen categories of embargoed goods are necessities for national defense industries and military manufacturing. After being prohibited from being exported this time, they will be controlled and manipulated by the Japanese side, and transported in large quantities to Japan and occupied areas. As for the traditional legitimate interests of export merchants of other nationalities, they will be rejected and destroyed in the future. This measure was originally issued in retaliation for the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by the UK and the US, but is it only the merchants of the UK and the US who are suffering? Even other friendly countries are also affected, and Chinese merchants, especially those who have relations with the free zone, suffer the most.</p>
<h3 id="e55">New Regulations Set by Hong Kong Authorities to Restrict Women and Children from Landing or Transiting, Permission Must Be Obtained Before Changing Ships, Should Wait in Macau During Waiting Period <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>According to the latest regulations published by the Hong Kong authorities, in the future, Hong Kong will no longer allow women and children to land or transit, and exceptions will only be allowed in very unusual circumstances. It is found that the Hong Kong government has been trying to tighten the regulations on women and children landing in Hong Kong, but it was not until recently that the previously set regulations were tightened. Previously, women and children passing through Hong Kong were allowed to stay in the port for no more than seven days to wait for another ship. This measure has now been prohibited.</p>
<p>Must Go to Macau to Wait for the Ship to Come</p>
<p>The new regulations also stipulate that women and children who want to change ships in Hong Kong must first obtain permission from the British Consulate Passport Office to the Hong Kong authorities before they are allowed to change ships. In addition, women and children are not allowed to land when waiting to change ships. If the ship they are on arrives in Hong Kong and the ship they want to board has not yet arrived, they must go to Macau to wait temporarily. As soon as the ship they want to board arrives in Hong Kong, they will be notified and allowed to go to Hong Kong to board another ship.</p>
<p>Regardless of Nationality, All Are Subject to Restrictions</p>
<p>Regarding women and children passing through Hong Kong on the original ship, they are only allowed to land in Hong Kong in very exceptional circumstances. All those under the age of eighteen are considered children. According to local explanations, all women and children, regardless of nationality, are subject to these new regulations.</p>

<p>Stamps commemorating national construction through thrift were sold by all post offices across the country from the 21st of last month. Due to environmental conditions, Shanghai was delayed in receiving them. It was not until last week that a batch was sent by the Kunming General Post Office and began to be sold yesterday. The denominations include eight cents, twenty-one cents, twenty-eight cents, thirty-three cents, fifty cents, and one yuan, six types in total. There is also a miniature sheet, with a full set printed on each sheet, which has already been sold by the philatelic office. It is decided that there will also be a second batch sent, with beautiful colors and styles. It is best to affix these commemorative stamps to mail to the free Chinese area and within the Shanghai Concession. It is best to avoid affixing them to mail to occupied areas.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Principal and Interest of Unified Public Bonds Due Paid by Chongqing, Shanghai Branches of China and Communications Banks Act as Agents <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>After consultation with the National Debt Fund Management Committee, the eleventh redemption of principal and due interest on the unified public bonds of the Republic of China of 1936, types A, B, C, D, and E, will be discounted and paid by the China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks. The Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks are allowed to start handling payments from today. The discounting method is divided into six phases, one month for each phase, and the principal and interest will be fully cleared by the end of December 1941, and paid in legal tender. However, due to environmental conditions, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Qingdao will be paid by the Chongqing General Bank. Regarding Shanghai, the Shanghai branches of the China, Central, and Communications Banks can act as agents.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Over Forty Junks Traveling Between Zhenhai and Dinghai Destroyed for Crossing Japanese Blockade Line <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to Ta Tung News Agency, the Japanese side still strictly blocks the Zhenhai-Zhoushan route. Junks passing by, if spotted, will be immediately seized and burned. On the 25th of this month, Japanese warships searched for more than 40 junks sailing from Zhenhai in the waters near Dinghai. First, the passengers on board were driven ashore, and the goods and ships were all burned. Also, recently, the number of junks coming to Shanghai from Zhenhai has suddenly decreased. This is due to the rampant piracy along the way. Moreover, the Japanese shipping company Toa Kaiun has already started operating the Mingdo Maru between Shanghai and Ningbo, and many passengers are unwilling to take the risk of taking junks. It is also reported that since the Japanese ship Ningbo Maru joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route, there are now two ships sailing back and forth. The sailing vessels between Shanghai and Ningbo are often robbed by pirates, and the danger is extremely high, so those who do not need to do not plan to take sailing vessels to Shanghai, resulting in a sharp decrease in sailing vessels in recent days. Regarding the route between Zhenhai and Zhoushan, it has not resumed due to the strict blockade by the Japanese side, which prohibits navigation.</p>

<p>The NYK Line's passenger ship Nitta Maru is scheduled to leave the Wayside Wharf at noon today (the 31st) for Kobe. However, it is not yet known whether the ship will continue to sail to the United States according to the schedule. The NYK Line in this city said that the destination of the Nitta Maru after arriving in Kobe will depend on the instructions of the NYK Line in Kobe. It is found that the Nitta Maru, with a deadweight of 9397 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Manila on the morning of the 29th without calling at Hong Kong on the way. However, the US government recently issued an order allowing Japanese ships entering US ports to clear customs and sail out without being affected by the freeze order. Therefore, the Nitta Maru may be able to take the route through Honolulu to San Francisco and Los Angeles. The next NYK Line passenger ship scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Monday is the Kurenai Maru, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on August 15 after mooring in Manila.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Over 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Unloading Begins This Morning <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Thai commercial ship S.S. Thepastri Nawa, managed by Taishengli Company on the third floor of the Shanghai Bank Building on Jiangxi Road, exported by Tongyi Shipping Company, arrived in port from Bangkok at 7 pm yesterday, carrying 4,000 tons of foreign rice, totaling 41,000 bags, and docked at the Longmao Warehouse Wharf in Pudong. Unloading will begin this morning. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 15,000 bags of foreign rice at a low price from the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong, and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The Municipal Council's low-priced foreign rice has arrived in port one after another, as announced in the commercial news section of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Assessed Selling Price Must Not Exceed Limit</p>
<p>The Rice Evaluation Committee of the French Concession officially assessed the standard selling price of four types of foreign rice a few days ago, which has won the satisfaction of residents throughout the city. It is learned that the French Concession authorities have notified all rice shops in the city that all rice sold must be sold at the established price, and must not be stolen, reduced in quantity, or raised in price for profit. If anyone dares to violate this, once discovered, they will be punished according to the regulations. Those who purchase rice who know of such misconduct can report it to the nearest police station or patrol, and the responsible personnel of the shops will be immediately arrested and punished according to the law. It is hoped that all rice shops will take the overall situation into consideration and abide by the regulations.</p>
<p>Sources of Foreign Rice Continuously Arriving</p>
<p>Reporters learned from the rice industry that the previously traded large quantity of foreign rice was about 300,000 bags (mostly small-grained rice, followed by Siamese rice, and less Saigon rice). They have already been shipped from the production area and are currently en route to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in port in mid-August, so the city's food reserves will become more and more substantial. After the rice market opened yesterday, people's minds were stable and the market situation was very good. The selling price of foreign rice was gradually decreasing, at about 35 yuan per stone. Later, because large households were buying at low prices, it was raised by one or two yuan.</p>

<p>All residents of the East and West Siwenli on Xinzha Road in this port held an emergency representative meeting the night before last because the owner limited the supply of water to be stopped from August 6. After deliberation, it was decided to send representatives to contact the relevant parties such as the Water Company, Fire Brigade, Sanitary Department of the Municipal Council, and Xinzha Police Station. On the one hand, they entrusted a lawyer to write to the lessor and the water company to negotiate, asking not to cut off the water supply.</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Launching Group Donations; Newspaper Employees Planning to Contribute</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, since its humble inception, has received enthusiastic contributions from all walks of life, allowing it to accumulate a substantial amount in the shortest possible time. Impoverished scholars have benefited greatly. Recently, Mr. Huang Yuzhai and Mr. Ding Huikang first raised a large sum, followed by a group donation from the China Travel Service staff, working together to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Employees of this newspaper are also launching a group donation, which will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donations</p>
<p>Yesterday's donors: Mr. Cao Suiyuan, 200 yuan; Readers, 140 yuan; Mr. Gui Jingzong, 50 yuan; Mr. Yao Wenming (found money), 30 yuan; Mr. Zhao Jingkui, 10 yuan; Mr. Zhang Maoxiang, 10 yuan; Mr. Yu Huiguang and Mr. Cheng Molie, 10 yuan each; Mr. Wu Weiyao, 5 yuan; Mr. Zhou Qiaosheng, 2 yuan; Ren Ji, 2 yuan; Mr. Gu Ming, 2 yuan; Mr. Hu Handa, 1 yuan; Mr. Zeng Yongchang, 1 yuan. Totaling 463 yuan. Previous balance: 15,437 yuan and 52 fen. Grand total: 15,900 yuan and 52 fen.</p>
<p>Found Money for Education</p>
<p>A letter from Shen Bao reader Mr. Yao Wenming states: "To whom it may concern, I respectfully report that I found 30 yuan in national currency on Baliqiao Road. I waited patiently for a long time, but no one came to claim it. I humbly believe that the ancient teaching of 'seeing wealth and thinking of righteousness' is clear. It is obvious that this money cannot be taken for oneself. Fortunately, your newspaper has a righteous cause of scholarship aid, benefiting impoverished and outstanding students. Its contribution is not insignificant. Therefore, I will transfer the money to the scholarship fund to benefit the person who lost it."</p>
<p>Proceeds from Book Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Xiao Zhenghao, the "Wolongshan Person," sent a letter stating that he would initiate the donation of 500 pages of calligraphy and painting fans, using the proceeds to support the scholarship fund, and adding a round seal on the fans stating "Donation Commemorating the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund." Mr. Xiao's action is well-intentioned. However, this newspaper's committee has a resolution that "If there are any fundraising plans from the outside, we welcome voluntary donations, but please do not use the name of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund." The principle has been established and cannot be changed. If Mr. Xiao donates some of the proceeds from the book sales, it would be fortunate for both the impoverished students and this newspaper.</p>

<p>Gu Bingyi Passes Away: Funeral to be Held at 10 AM Today</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Bingyi of Nanhui, aged 70, was of charitable disposition. He suddenly contracted dysentery a week ago. Despite repeated consultations with Chinese and Western doctors, he ultimately succumbed to his advanced age and failing health, passing away at his Shanghai residence at approximately 2 AM the day before yesterday. The funeral is scheduled for 10 AM today (the 31st) at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road. A brief account of Mr. Bingyi's life is provided below: When Mr. Yang Sisheng of Qingpu Pudong founded Pudong Middle School, he received Mr. Gu’s planning and his contribution was extremely great. In his prime, he went to Harbin to found the Far East Daily News, and to Vladivostok to found the Dongfang Xiaobao. Later, he ran the Citizen Daily in Changchun and the Jilin Daily. Subsequently, he ran the Ji-Chang Daily. He once served as the Director of the Jilin Official Book Bureau, the Secretary-General of the Chinese Eastern Railway Administration. Each time the provincial government decided to reorganize, he held important positions. For example, when the Chinese government reclaimed the sovereignty of the Chinese Eastern Railway, eradicated the forces of the Russian General Horvath, and disbanded the armed forces of 200,000 Russian soldiers and police, Mr. Bao Guiqing, then General, with Mr. Gu, Zheng Qian, Zhang Huanxiang, and others, planned everything and ultimately succeeded. Afterwards, when Bao resigned, Mr. Gu served as Acting Superintendent for several months, and his administration continued to be outstanding. What cannot be erased is that during his term, there was a strike by Russian workers. Mr. Gu consulted with Zhang Huanxiang and others to deploy defenses and stop the strike. At the same time, he urgently telegraphed the Ministry, mobilized engineers from all over, and concentrated them at Goubangzi Station, awaiting orders. Upon hearing the news, the Russian side immediately ended the strike. In 1933, Mr. Gu, tired of officialdom, returned to Shanghai. Now, he has suddenly passed away, which is deeply mourned.</p>

<p>American Films Banned from Shipment to North China</p>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports that although American films shipped to various ports in North China paid taxes according to regulations, they have now been banned by the Japanese authorities in North China. American film distributors in Shanghai received a telegram today (the 30th) from their North China office stating, "Films can no longer be shipped to the occupied cities." One telegram stated that the transportation of films has now been "temporarily" prohibited. According to a film distributor yesterday morning, the transportation of films to and from various ports in China has already been taxed according to regulations. The current ban is an extraordinary act of discrimination. Furthermore, the shipment of films to the occupied areas does not involve the exchange of funds, so there is no reason to prohibit their transport. Moreover, the films are not being shipped out of China, but only transported between cities within China. It is reported that American film companies here have telegraphed their film distribution headquarters in New York about this action taken by the Japanese authorities, and are awaiting clarification of the situation. Customs officials this morning could not comment on the film ban. Mr. Oyamada, the Japanese tax official at the Jianghai Customs, who is in charge of export permits, said that all export applications would be "temporarily" disallowed.</p>

<p>Detective Chen Zhihong of the Old Zha Police Station Assassinated; Two Assailants Resist Arrest, One Killed, One Wounded; Stray Bullets Injure University Professor and Two Others</p>
<p>At approximately 8 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Fujian Road in the Public Concession. The victim was Chen Zhihong, a detective from the Old Zha Police Station, who died on the spot. Two assailants resisted arrest and engaged in a firefight with the police, resulting in one death and one injury. At the same time, stray bullets injured three pedestrians. The details gathered by reporters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot While Driving</p>
<p>Chen Zhihong, 40 years old, from Ningbo, was a No. 10 detective in the Public Concession Police, serving at the Old Zha Police Station for the past three years. He was known to be diligent and proficient in Japanese. He previously ran a food store in Tokyo. His home was located at No. 9, Guixingli, Lane 380, Guangdong Road. At 8:11 AM yesterday morning, Chen left his home in his own chartered rickshaw (the rickshaw puller was Xiao Ma Pi A San from Taizhou) to go to work, as usual. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Fujian Road, two assailants, pre-positioned in front of the Yuanyuan Hotel and the Yongjiang Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant across Jiujiang Road, opened fire upon seeing Chen's rickshaw.</p>
<p>Police Pursue, Both Sides Engage in Firefight</p>
<p>Chen, caught completely off guard, was hit by two bullets, one in the chest and one in the head, bleeding profusely. He immediately collapsed in the rickshaw. The rickshaw puller abandoned the rickshaw in front of the Ren Hengtai mat shop at No. 533 Jiujiang Road, and called for help. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, proceeded north on Jiujiang Road to Hubei Road, crossed Nanjing Road to Zhejiang Road, and then to Ningbo Road. By this time, nearby police officers had heard the alarm and were pursuing them with their guns drawn. The assailants, to gain the upper hand, opened fire on the police, who returned fire. A major firefight ensued, with the sound of gunfire constantly ringing out.</p>
<p>One Assailant Killed, One Wounded</p>
<p>One assailant, in his twenties, wearing a white silk short shirt and pants, and a straw hat, fled to the entrance of Ren Ji at No. 88, Gujia Lane, near the Beijing Road intersection, where he was shot in the waist by Detective No. 141, an Indian officer. The bullet entered his abdomen, and he collapsed on the ground, barely breathing, and was captured. The other assailant, about 30 years old, was shot down on the sidewalk at the corner of Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road by Detective No. 75 and Chinese Officer No. 9. He was shot in the chest and waist, a fatal wound, and died on the spot.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure Three Pedestrians</p>
<p>During the firefight, stray bullets injured three pedestrians. One was Zheng Rif, a 43-year-old Guangdong native, residing at No. 302 Hankou Road, a PhD in Philosophy from Ohio Wesleyan University in the United States, and currently a professor at Jiaotong University. He was shot in the left leg. Another was Yu Yaoqing, 16 years old, residing at No. 16 Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, who was injured in the right leg. The third was Cheng Xirong, 25 years old, from Tongzhou, currently serving as the No. 100 Old Steward at Wing On Company. All three were rushed to Renji Hospital by police ambulance.

<p>Shanghai Elders Initiate Memorial for Wang Dankui</p>
<p>The late Wang Dankui, an elder statesman of Jiangzhe, a hermit farmer, was revered for his virtue and literary talent. In his early years in politics, he was known for his integrity and competence. Since the revolution, he has made many contributions to transportation, water conservancy, industry, and charity. In the past decade, he served the party and the country with great merit. In the winter of 1937, he took refuge in Shanghai, living in seclusion and writing. Later, he served as the chairman of the Chengming College of Arts and Sciences, guiding the college's affairs with great effort. However, due to years of worrying about national affairs, his physical strength gradually declined. Last autumn, he contracted rhinitis, which spread to his face and became cancerous. Despite being treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, he ultimately succumbed to his age and illness and passed away this summer. The nation mourns the loss of this great man. It is reported that the Shanghai elders Tang Weizhi, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Chen Taoyi, Wen Lanting, Chen Baochu, and fellow Jiangzhe natives Shen Qiquan, Shen Enfu, Zou Jiabai, Hong Zhongjun, Zhu Xixuan, Chen Yaxiong, Du Shaoru, and others have initiated the organization of a preparatory committee to commemorate Wang Dankui. They will convene a meeting at 5 PM on August 1st at the Sixth Floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to decide on a date to hold a memorial service to express their condolences.</p>

<p>Finance: A Big Thunder, Little Rain; Exchange Market Panic Has Passed; New Transactions Established Yesterday</p>
<p>This move to freeze foreign exchange seems to be a forceful and earth-shattering one, but on the exchange market for the past few days, the situation has been very bizarre, with entries and exits remaining free and transactions not restricted. It seems like a tiger's head and a snake's tail, a big thunder with little rain. Commentators say that the central bank does not want to act too hastily and is still not giving up its appeasement policy. Yesterday, nine-day transactions were established, and Hong Kong cables were also released, so that even those who are skeptical do not see any empty threats.</p>
<p>The exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change. The black market for the US-British exchange rate continued to ease and depreciate. However, as Hong Kong cables were released, Chinese merchants were only moderately, and not desperately, hoarding. The amount hoarded by import firms also decreased. Chinese firms and Anglo-American firms had a good intention to sell. HSBC's small counter of US exchange rate has extended the period and even has new September period transactions opening, which shows people's hearts becoming more stable. A US exchange rate of 5.25 yuan once hardened to a point where it could be settled. British gold eased to three office clerks 1.71875. Later, US orders softened slightly. In the end, the US and British exchange rates continued to ease. There were not many transactions during the morning. Speculators still lack new buying and selling. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Cables Also Released</p>
<p>Since the early morning, foreign cables showed that the British, US, and Indian silver markets were all flat. Exchange rates of various countries also did not fluctuate. The central government's listed exchange rates did not change. Domestic banks opened earlier, with the selling price for the current rate initially opening at 0.3125 for the British pound, calculated as three office clerks 1.71875. US dollars opened at 5.21875 yuan, also up 0.3125. Chinese speculators came to hoard August at 5.21875, and it immediately softened to 5.1875 yuan. HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change. The white silver balancing tax remained at a slight 24.25%. HSBC's small counter for US exchange rate has been extended by 0.0625, calculated at 5.1875 yuan. Hong Kong cables came and were released for a profitable July US dollar at 5.25 yuan, which made the trend cheap again. Chinese merchants, Chinese banks, and HSBC all hoarded August US dollars at 5.21875. Import firms hoarded the September rate at 5.25, mostly supplied by two American banks, in significant amounts. At noon, the current rate to the August rate was three office clerks 1.71875 yuan for the British pound and 5.21875 yuan for the US dollar, both up 0.3125 yuan from the previous day's closing rate.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Loosens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th (Wednesday) cable, this morning's exchange market opened flat. British and Japanese exchange rates remain unchanged. The US exchange rate for the spot market is loose 0.125, at 24.8125. The Shanghai exchange rate for the spot market increased by five cents, to 478 yuan. There is no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rates All Increased</p>
<p>Tianjin, 30th (Wednesday) cable, this morning's exchange market opened flat. London and New York cable transfers hardened 0.125, to 5.8125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by one yuan, to 90 yuan. The "Allied Note" black market rose by three and a half yuan, to 52 and a half yuan.</p>

<p>Gold is Valued for Its Authenticity: Futures are Flat, But Spot Prices Remain High</p>
<p>Yesterday's black market for raw gold, the initial trading session rose, and then saw a return to flat. The 6,700 yuan mark was challenged several times but quickly returned. All parties' minds remained wavering. After 13 quarters of an hour, due to the soaring price of raw yarn by 100 yuan, the buying frenzy was stimulated. Shanghai West gangs of people came from all directions, and securities firms made a strong advance. It once came to 6,655 yuan, rising to 6,720 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange continued to ease, it fell back to the strength of the gold shop gangs selling at noon. In the end, the price was the same as the previous day's closing price. There were 30 to 40 thousand taels traded in half a day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The swap (from July to August) was offered small at 50 yuan by the seller to the buyer. Cash saw another increase. Yida and Wanfeng each offered tens of taels, with the price for jewelry stores at 7,900 yuan. Litai offered Defu thirty taels, with the price at 7,920 yuan. Shihe offered a certain jewelry store fifty taels, priced at 7,960 yuan, rising 50 yuan. Xizhang Yong offered Defu fifty taels, priced at 7,950 yuan. Gold jewelry also rose by five yuan, reaching 815 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Resulted in a Flat Market</p>
<p>Since the morning, the opening price at 9:15 AM for each bar (ten taels) was 6,665 yuan, calculated to open low eight yuan. Litai sold small to 6,660 yuan. It was heard that the August US dollar rate of 5.21875 was difficult to settle. Chengji, Yiyuan, and Xinfengyong all entered, and prices immediately rose 30 yuan, reaching 6,690 yuan. Not long after, the exchange market softened again, and Xinfengyong released again, and scattered investors such as Yili and Litai sold off, so it was suppressed down 35 yuan, to 6,655 yuan. Securities gangs absorbed, just at the time of returning up. Upon hearing that raw yarn had suddenly increased greatly, Tongkangyong and Yida scrambled to enter. Litai came again to buy, silver shops and small investors scrambled to absorb, and the price gradually rose more than 60 yuan, breaking out beyond 6,700 yuan, reaching 6,720 yuan. However, since the foreign exchange still carried loosening, sellers were not lacking. Fluctuations around 6,700 yuan were quite sustained. Xianghe, Defu, and Hesheng sold, and scattered investors also sold off, so it was lowered to 6,665 yuan. It was then raised by floating investors to 6,180 yuan. At noon, the closing price was 6,673 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price. After closing, it rose to 6,678 yuan and then fell back to 6,670 yuan. There was a high and low of 65 yuan during the first half of the day. There was no market in the afternoon. Cash houses had no prices. The selling price of the official gold of cash houses was above 8,000 yuan. Purchase was at "150 yuan". The current standard gold had no price or market.</p>

<p>British and American Gold Pounds:—Soared Five Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: although the market price of raw gold was stable, the British and American gold pounds soared by five yuan due to the limited amount of circulation. The trend of the British gold pound was weak. The American gold note opened at 1,918 yuan. After opening, Xiangyuanyong and Taiyong sold off, retreating to 13 yuan. Rentaiyong, Dagong, Tongyizhi, and Cheng came to buy, raising it to 23 yuan. Zhengda and Changda sold off, and it retreated again to 15 yuan. Liji bought slightly, and the afternoon close raised it to 1,917 yuan, up one yuan from the previous day. The spot price was still 18 yuan 9 jiao. The trend of the Hong Kong note was firm, and the Japanese gold note was also firm, rising to 2.06 yuan in the evening market. The Korean note was weak, retreating to 1.1 yuan in the evening market. In addition, the rise and fall of the Annam note and others were uneven.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Yarn Flowers: A Terrible Storm, Sacrificing Several Small Yarn Firms in Vain. Cotton Yarn Can Still Be Exported, Market Prices Surge Immediately, with a Difference of Over Two Hundred Yuan in a Single Day <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn market has experienced sharp declines and surges, with fluctuations of one to two hundred yuan. This situation makes people fearful and leads to various tricks and widespread rumors, resulting in inconsistent policies. It keeps speculators in a frenzy. Several small yarn firms engaged in short-term speculation have run aground and closed down in this turbulent storm. The previous day's sharp decline was attributed to customs banning the export of cotton yarn and cloth, which made the bulls timid. However, to be honest, most of the cotton yarn exported today is smuggled. Therefore, the previous attempt to prohibit exports, although seemingly forceful, had the opposite effect. Those doing business themselves suffered losses and complained incessantly. As a result, yesterday, rumors spread that exports were allowed without hindrance, and it was said that the Guangdong merchants had begun customs declaration with approved permits. This greatly boosted morale, and the shorts rushed to cover their positions, while the bulls seized the opportunity to push prices up. The market price rose in a straight line, opening at 1,455 yuan, falling to 1,435 yuan, and then gradually advancing, reaching 1,595 yuan around noon. In the afternoon, due to the recent fluctuations exceeding normal limits, the public advocated for small transactions. Therefore, no open trading occurred, but private trading started at 1,610 yuan, falling to 1,550 yuan, and the final price was 1,585 yuan. The previous day's low price in the afternoon was 1,405 yuan, and yesterday's high price was 1,610 yuan, a difference of 205 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma Morning Opening: Due to many short sales the previous day, the situation was still weak. The opening price was more than 30 yuan lower than the previous day's private trading, at 1,455 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,465 yuan, but selling pressure was still strong, with few buyers, because the Guangdong merchants had no demand. It fell to 1,435 yuan, fluctuating between 1,430 and 1,450 yuan for quite a while. Later, large Shanghai West merchants suddenly started buying, and at the same time, Guangdong merchants took in hundreds of bales of warehouse receipts. In an instant, the market situation changed suddenly, the typhoon tightened, and prices rose step by step. By 11:30, it had broken through the 1,500 yuan mark, rising directly to 1,595 yuan. Everyone said that customs had allowed exports. The closing price returned to 1,565 yuan. It is found that the transaction volume in half a day was 10,900 bales, all transacted by peers.</p>
<p>Jin Shuangma Futures Yarn Market: Yesterday, the July futures yarn settlement was closed, so there were no news reports. It is found that the July futures opened on June 2, with an initial price of 1,380 yuan. On the same day, it fell slightly to 1,360 yuan. On July 3, it rose to 1,501 yuan. By the morning of the 19th, the final closing price was 1,438 yuan, an increase of 58 yuan compared to the initial price, with a difference of 141 yuan between the high and low prices. The settlement price was determined to be 1,451 yuan, averaging the recorded prices for the last three days. As of the 19th, there were still 1,820 outstanding transactions, of which 740 bales were actually settled. The delivered goods included 330 bales of 10s Hongbin Yi, 80 bales of Boy Scout, 180 bales of 16s Weaver Girl, 50 bales of Single Earth, 40 bales of Heavenly Maiden, 40 bales of 20s Heavenly Maiden, 20 bales of Double Earth. The remaining 1,080 bales were all settled independently. The deliverers were mostly from No. 19, No. 56, No. 52, and No. 40, while the receivers were mostly from No. 2, No. 69, No. 70, and No. 16. A list of the opening, closing, high, and low prices for the July futures is recorded on the left (net market bid).</p>
<p>Jin Shuangma July Futures Yarn</p>
<p>Initial Price 1,380.00</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is still sluggish, and American cotton is moving downstream. However, the yarn market has rebounded, but sales have not developed, and factories still lack demand. Therefore, the cotton market is also difficult to improve significantly.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell due to bull liquidation and favorable weather conditions. At the same time, due to political news from Washington that price controls would include all agricultural products, it continued to fall. As a result, the closing price was down 23-24 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying and hopes that tensions in the Far East would ease. However, it subsequently fell back due to bull liquidation and cotton merchants selling short. As a result, yesterday's closing price fell by 15 to 32 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade market was quiet and weak. With the continued tensions in the Far East and no concrete measures to ensure safe trade, foreign cotton trade remains in a state of stagnation.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Piece Goods: Buyers of Cloth Are Elated. Japan, Considering East Asian Piece Goods, Revokes the Ban on Yarn and Cloth Shipments <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market first fell and then rose yesterday, with huge fluctuations in selling prices. The main reason for this was that after the ban on exports the previous day, East Asian piece goods were most affected, and market prices soared, which was detrimental to themselves. To resolve the issue, the ban on yarn and cloth was revoked, and customs also allowed exports accordingly. As a result, morale improved, and buying interest was revived. Fuguixi cloth opened at 44 yuan, and Fuguixi twill at 41.75 yuan. In the afternoon, they rebounded to 45.70 yuan and 42.5 yuan respectively, resulting in gains of 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. Other grades saw similar gains. Coarse cloth was flat, and bleached and dyed cloth rose 0.5 to 1 yuan. Transactions of various cloths in this street totaled more than 300 pieces. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants were urgently trying to reload goods that had been returned by customs the previous day for export, adding just over 100 new pieces. Merchants from the north road, including Tianjin, handled 150-160 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, and woolen cloth.</p>
<p>Yesterday's East Asian cloth exchange had no market due to settlement, and the spot market was particularly lively. Market prices also fluctuated greatly, changing rapidly. Baituo Longtou Fine Cloth opened in the morning around 51 yuan, closing at 51.60 yuan. In the afternoon, upon hearing the news of customs export clearance, the Shuangma private market jumped wildly, and morale was instantly boosted. It was only buying, not selling, pushing prices higher and higher. Longtou soared to 52.90 yuan, and Biji jumped to 1.6875 yuan. However, many floating profits had already been taken, and sales resumed, causing prices to fall again. Finally, with strong purchases from peers in this street, prices rose again at closing. The Longtou Fine Cloth factory order was 52.45 yuan, an increase of 1.55 yuan per piece. Sijunzi Biji was 1.665 yuan, also up 0.03 yuan. This was still the price for old orders with old taxes. New orders with old taxes would add 0.015 yuan per yard, and new orders with new taxes would add 0.025 yuan.</p>

<p>The edible oil market has been like a runaway horse in recent days, galloping ever more vigorously. Because the sources are all controlled by a certain party, oil merchants are seizing the opportunity to hoard and profit, exerting all their efforts to push prices up. Dalian soybean oil set a new record high of 255 yuan. Crude soybean oil generally rose more than 20 yuan compared to the previous day, and cottonseed oil was also raised by more than 10 yuan. The total market sold 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 252 to 255 yuan, 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at a price of 252 yuan, and more than 100 barrels of crude oil at a price of 232 to 252 yuan.

<h3 id="e85">Food: Newly Arrived Foreign Rice: Over 50,000 Bags <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market experienced a sharp decline in the morning. Both futures and spot rice prices fell sharply. This was due to the abundance of rice stored in the market, totaling nearly three million shi, but exports were lacking. The market received supplies of Hong Kong rice and tribute rice, and in addition to the continued ordering of Hong Kong rice, the French Concession Public Works Bureau also decided to limit the sale of tribute rice, not allowing prices to exceed those of the 25th. Therefore, the public was very stable, and the blind rush to sell rice in recent days had slowed down. The large holders of goods in the market were also intimidated by rumors that warehouses would be controlled, and many sold along with the market, eagerly selling off floating profits. Therefore, the opening price in the early market immediately fell by three, four, or five yuan. Xiaojiao rice once fell to 118 yuan. Later, due to the low price triggering short-term trading, merchants from Shanghai West and the mainland also absorbed along with the market. Therefore, the price rose to 111 yuan by noon, but the result was still 1 to 3 yuan lower than the previous day. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,000 to 14,000 bags, plus 600 tons from Yinghua Si. Xiaojiao spot rice in original bags was 148 to 148.12 yuan, futures 147 to 146.5 yuan, broken rice 106 yuan, and No. 2 Tong rice spot 139 to 138.5 yuan, futures 138.5 to 139 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived yesterday afternoon, bringing 15,000 bags of Public Works Bureau foreign rice from Zhagang, docking at the Puxi Lan Yantong Wharf for unloading. Also, the Thai ship S.S. Thepsatri Nawa entered the port at 5:45 PM yesterday, bringing approximately 41,000 bags of foreign rice from Siam, docking at the Puxi Longmao Wharf for unloading. It is said that the Zhaohua Company's Zhishali ship is bringing a large batch of Javanese foreign rice, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it had not arrived by evening and is expected to arrive today.</p>
<p>It is said that the market for thick and thin japonica rice has been experiencing difficulties in transportation, and the source has suddenly become scarce, causing the owners to regard their goods as rare and unwilling to sell them easily. At the same time, the general public, upon hearing this news, is also more interested in buying. Therefore, it has not been affected by foreign rice and has shown a unique color, with sales prices increasing by about one yuan. Kainan Port's fresh early and late rice is priced at 155 to 153 yuan, and Wuxi original packaged white japonica is priced at 143 to 140 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is also scarce in the market, and owners are quite firm in their intention to sell. Therefore, although shipments are sporadic, the prices of both domestic and foreign goods have remained stable, without any changes. The prices for Hong Kong white yuan glutinous rice range from 126 to 123 yuan, green glutinous rice from 106 to 113 yuan, and domestic yuan glutinous rice from 127 to 128 yuan.</p>

<p>The off-exchange market for public bonds was still unusually uncertain yesterday, rising and falling sharply, with a difference of as much as 2.4 yuan. The market was already in a state of confusion. The lowest price for Class C bonds was 67.8 yuan, including interest. Excluding interest, it was only 64.5 yuan, which was an excessive drop. Therefore, it recovered by one yuan later. Starting this afternoon, the market price will be calculated excluding interest. There are quite a few short sellers in the market, and there are also many who are reversing their positions. Most of the buyers are covering their short positions. In the morning, Tongxing Hong, Dasheng, and Da bought, while Yitai, Yiji, Lianhe, and Lemao Lianyi sold. The high price reached 70.02 yuan, and the noon closing was only 69.45 yuan. In the afternoon, selling pressure was even stronger, with Yitai, Xinhua, Xinfu, Xinfeng, and Lemao selling very heavily. Dahua, Gongmao, Yiji, Xiexing, Yuan Lianyi bought. It first fell sharply, with the lowest price at 67.8 yuan, the lowest price recently. Then it gradually rose to 68.70 yuan at closing. As a result, it fell again by 0.15 to 1.30 yuan, with Class D suffering the most losses. The total transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Zhejiang Promotes the School Rice System: Teachers Receive 30 Jin of Ribbon Rice Per Month, and Each Student Pays 15 Jin Per Semester <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondence) The treatment of teachers and staff in secondary schools in Zhejiang Province has always been meager. Recently, with rising prices, life has become more difficult. The Education Department, recognizing this, has formulated the "Provisional Measures for Implementing the School Rice System in Public and Private Secondary Schools in Zhejiang Province" to stabilize their livelihood, enable them to concentrate on their work, and promote social respect for teachers. It will be implemented on a trial basis starting from the first semester of the 30th year. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Education Department of Zhejiang Province has formulated these measures to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff in public and private secondary schools, enable them to concentrate on their work, and foster a social atmosphere of respect for teachers. 2. The rice needed by teachers and staff in public and private secondary schools in the province will be provided jointly by all students in the school, provisionally set at 30 jin per person per month, with one semester calculated as five months. However, part-time teachers and staff who do not specialize in education will not be provided with school rice. Those who have already received school rice from another school will also not be provided with it again. 3. Students will pay a maximum of 15 jin of school rice per semester. However, public-funded students, tuition-free students, and relief students may be granted reductions or exemptions by the school depending on the circumstances. The amount of school rice to be paid in the preceding paragraph should be determined by the school based on the total number of teachers and students in the school, and the students' families should be notified before the start of the semester. 4. Students should pay the school rice in full at one time before the start of the semester. In special circumstances, the school may decide to allow payment in installments and may convert the payment to cash or miscellaneous grains at the price of rice in the school's location at the time of payment. School rice paid by students who drop out or withdraw from school midway will not be refunded. 5. After the school receives the school rice, it should immediately issue a receipt and distribute it to each teacher and staff member on a monthly basis. If there is any surplus after distribution each semester, it should be retained for the next semester's school rice. If there is a shortage, the teachers and staff should purchase it themselves. School rice for teachers and staff who are dismissed or resign midway will be provided up to the date of dismissal or resignation. 6. The collection, storage, and distribution of school rice should be handled by a special committee organized by five to seven people publicly elected by all teachers and staff, with the director of the administrative office as an ex officio member. 7. The actual amount of school rice received and the distribution situation each semester should be announced at the school at the end of the semester. Provincial schools should also report to the Education Department, and county private schools should submit a report through the county government to the Education Department for record. 8. These measures will be implemented after being formulated and promulgated by the Education Department of Zhejiang Province.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Children's News has launched the Top Ten Invitational Table Tennis Championship. The first meeting was held last night, with Chen Linsheng presiding over everything. It is known that Chen recently had family matters to attend to in Shanghai as his wife and children came from the countryside, and he was concerned that it would hinder the progress of the Cup. He specifically sent a letter to resign yesterday, but the committee was unable to retain him. Then, the name "Top Ten" was deemed too narrow, and it was decided to rename it the Senior Cup League, so that teams of equal strength would also have the opportunity to participate. The committees selected over twenty teams to be invited. The invitation letters are scheduled to be sent out today, but all invited teams must submit their rosters within one week for review. The competition will adopt the Far Eastern method, with seven players per team, allowing registration of ten players. The registration fee and security deposit are both 8 yuan.

<h3 id="e97">Memory Methods for Reading (II) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Deling</p>
<p>3. Categories of Memory: Memory is divided into (1) Mechanical Memory, (2) Comprehension Memory, (3) Concrete Memory, (4) Abstract Memory.</p>
<p>(1) Mechanical Memory: Memorizing mechanical or meaningful things.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehension Memory: Memorizing meaningful and interconnected things.</p>
<p>(3) Concrete Memory: It is easier to memorize when concrete things exist.</p>
<p>(4) Abstract Memory: It is more difficult to memorize compared to concrete things.</p>
<p>4. Memory Methods</p>
<p>Regarding memory methods, the following points can be divided:</p>
<p>(1) Mechanical Memory Method: This method involves repeatedly memorizing meaningless materials, such as people's names, place names, or dates.</p>
<p>(2) Organized Memory Method: This method involves memorizing things in accordance with the consistency of theory, order, and relationships. However, attention must be paid to the following points:</p>
<p>i. Causal Relationship: Using this method, if you know the cause of something, you can predict its result, or if you know its result, you can infer its cause. We can apply this method to memorize when reading books on history or politics.</p>
<p>ii. Comparative Relationship: Comparing the similarities and differences of facts can help memorize their content. It is best to apply this method to memorize when reading social sciences such as geography.</p>
<p>(3) Systematic Relationship: This involves categorizing the system of facts and associating the relationships between the different parts to memorize them. We often use this method when reading books on geology and biology.</p>
<p>3. Technical Memory Method: This method involves using technical methods to record facts. There are three common methods we use when studying:</p>
<p>(i) Notation Method: When we are reading, we circle, mark, or underline important points or other things that must be memorized to make them easy to notice and memorize.</p>
<p>(ii) Abstracting Method: When reading, we record the outlines and other memorable things from the book beside the main text so that we can easily refer to them in the future and find them easily.</p>
<p>(iii) Note-Taking Method: When reading, we record the important items in the book.</p>
<p>(4) Using Association Method: This method seems similar to the organized memory method, but it is not the same. It closely connects many concepts together. When recalling, if you remember one of these many concepts, the rest can continuously reappear in your mind. This association method has both mechanical and conceptual differences.</p>

<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>For apprentices who enter the mountains to seek immortals and learn the Tao, many people scold the strange and martial arts novels; for young students who imitate the behavior of chivalrous thieves, many people think that they have been poisoned by detective novels. For a time, the sound of sweeping away toxic reading materials was deafening. This is certainly a good phenomenon in the cultural world, but so far, we only know that there are toxic reading materials on the market, and toxic reading materials should be strictly prohibited. But why are strange and martial arts novels toxic, and where does the toxin come from? What is the effect of spiritual toxins, and where is the standard for whether they are toxic or non-toxic? These more fundamental and important questions have not yet been raised for discussion, so that we only know that it is so, but we do not know why it is so. We only see its phenomena and effects, but we do not know its basis and source.</p>
<p>This important literary question, its effect and influence occur in the psychological and spiritual aspects of human beings, so we should regard it as a psychological problem. Generally speaking, the influence of literary works on readers occurs in the emotional aspect. The subtle and tortuous plot is fascinating, the subtle and moving descriptions make people yearn for it, and the encounters of the male and female protagonists arouse our hatred or sympathy, thus arousing our emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, surprise, and fear. The occurrence of emotions is originally a common thing, but whether literary works are toxic or not is entirely based on the emotions they arouse as the standard. If what it arouses is a kind of empty and illusory emotion, which is of no benefit to real life, then this is a toxic reading material.</p>
<p>Good reading materials should point out a realistic and constructive emotional outlet for readers!</p>

<h3 id="e99">Explosives Expert <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Revised and Expanded</p>
<p>Explosives are truly a strange thing. They can kill people, and they can also benefit mankind. Now, American explosives have not yet been loaded into cannons, but the amount consumed every day is already more than one million pounds. Originally, mining, quarrying, engineering, agriculture, and many other industries all use explosives, so it can be seen that explosives can redeem their sins.</p>
<p>Regarding this type of use of explosives, one point is worth emphasizing, that is, the experts who use it have rich knowledge and experience, and can calculate how much of a certain explosive is needed in a certain place without any error. Otherwise, it will backfire and the danger is unimaginable. For example, if there is a useless chimney in a certain place, it can only be blown down with explosives. At that time, the expert in charge of explosives must show his great skills to make the bricks and tiles falling from the air gather within a specific location, or even pile them around an upright wooden stick, and will never be scattered all over the ground and be out of control.</p>
<p>A factory is renovating its interior, and several machine bases made of cement must be removed. The only way is to use explosives, but the power of the explosives must be just right to avoid losses, because there are many valuable motors near those bases, and the roof and walls of the factory building are full of glass. The responsible expert then showed his skills, using appropriate explosives to blow away all the useless bases, preserving all the equipment in the factory.</p>
<p>A bank also hired an expert to be responsible for blasting a wall. When the wall collapsed, the bank continued to operate as usual, and no customer or employee was alarmed.</p>
<p>Those experts' control of explosives is truly instantaneous. They consider the situation and decide on the type and amount of explosives to be used, without being excessive or insufficient. The tunnel from the Colorado River in the United States to Los Angeles, which is ninety-two miles long, was built with explosives in six years. If there were no explosives at that time, it would probably take a thousand years to complete. We all know that explosives are a powerful tool for destruction, so it is not surprising that a pile of explosives can create a river channel that is eighteen feet wide, twelve feet deep, and one thousand seven hundred feet long in an instant, but it is indeed a strange thing that American orchards often use explosives to make fruits grow quickly. Experts bury explosives underground in the orchard, so that after the explosion, the soil will be loosened, so the roots of the fruit trees can easily spread, and the soil can easily absorb moisture. As a result, all the trees are thriving. They bloom and bear fruit two seasons earlier than usual. Withered trees that do not bloom can sometimes gradually revive with the help of a small amount of explosives.</p>
<p>In the past, when the American government built roads in humid areas, it had to proceed in sections to gradually fill in the high and low water pits before a good roadbed could be built, so a highway often took several years to complete. Now, with explosives experts, it only takes a wave of the hand to lay explosives at the appropriate locations to turn all the mud pits into flat ground.</p>
<p>In short, the use of explosives is becoming increasingly widespread. Farmers use it to blast rocks on farmland; public utilities companies use it to dig pits in the ground to install electric poles; farmers in the southern United States use it to collect pine resin; factories use it to blast rust-proof iron bolts and butterfly screws on machines; at the same time, explosives can also kill harmful birds and remove sunken ships.</p>
<p>In recent years, explosives have had a new use that is even more surprising, that is, oil field development companies have hired experts to use explosives to explore oil sources. Those experts bury a considerable amount of explosives, ranging from a few ounces to forty pounds, depending on the situation in each place, underground, and install sophisticated instruments one to seven miles away to measure the degree of vibration after the explosion, and record them with cameras. Scientists study the properties of the rocks and the time of the vibration based on that record, and they can know where oil and metal are hidden without fail.</p>
<p>Every spring, Americans use explosives in the mountains of Los Angeles to clear the accumulated snow on the ground without damaging the roads. This is also the credit of explosives experts, which is very admirable. In Quebec, Canada, several engineers and explosives experts cooperated to build a sluice gate weighing 11,000 tons (made of cement, 92 feet high, 45 feet wide, and 40 feet thick, with one end close to the river bank) in the rapids, completing a project that had been impossible for many years. They used 1,000 pounds of explosives to make such a heavy sluice gate stand firmly in the dangerous river.</p>
<p>Who says science is guilty? Isn't explosives a clear example of being a meritorious minister in construction undertakings?</p>

There are many popular actors on the stage who dress up so richly when they appear on stage, but when they are off stage, they wear a blue cloth gown all year round, and they can't even take out a penny from their pockets; it's all because they agreed to let their master rely on them in the first place, but the result is that they became their master's cash cow!</p>
<p>Of course, Shang Lao Er himself knew this trick very well, but he had also noticed Mei Bao's cleverness, and was afraid that if the conditions were discussed too early, the seeds of this cash cow would immediately fly back.</p>
<p>"That's right, your conscience is really good, I've seen it very clearly in the past few days! But rules are rules, in a few days, you have to ask your father to write a note, so that we can both feel at ease." He deliberately didn't let the face that was burned by opium smoke leave a trace of seriousness, and only pretended to be indifferent.</p>
<p>When she heard these words, Mei Bao couldn't help but hesitate in her heart. Although she couldn't predict what the content of the so-called "note" would be, since Shang Lao Er said that he wanted her father to come forward, then it seemed that she had to tell her father about this matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This was the most difficult thing for her.</p>
<p>"Then, Master, can we wait until he gets better before writing it?" she asked with twelve minutes of caution.</p>
<p>Shang Lao Er really knew the art of "playing hard to get" the best. "Don't be in a hurry, anytime is fine" he still smiled and said softly, "Starting tomorrow, let's learn the Wujia Slope opera first." (172)</p>

<p>There was a family in the United States that had a mother dog. Unfortunately, after giving birth to six puppies, the mother dog died. Seeing the six puppies being lonely and helpless, the owner felt very pity, so he came up with a novel idea to make a mother dog for them. He used a piece of wood to make six small holes, turned the baby bottles upside down, so that the six little orphans had an artificial mother dog and ate milk at the same time.</p>

<p>Ordinary people probably have an idea that if a country's plane flies into enemy territory to bomb, it will be easier to impersonate that country's plane if the paint color of the fuselage is changed. In fact, this kind of military trick is not often used by the air forces of various countries now. One of the main reasons is that the warships and aircraft of various countries carry communication codes that are changed daily. When an aircraft is soaring in the air above a warship, the navy will send out a secret code that the aircraft of its own country should be able to answer, but if that aircraft belongs to the enemy, it will not be able to answer with the correct code (or several consecutive signals). Therefore, any aircraft that cannot make a correct answer will be subject to fierce artillery fire. In addition, there is another fact that the shape of the enemy's aircraft has been carefully studied by the ground defense forces, so even if they fly high in the distance, it is difficult not to be immediately recognized.</p>

<h3 id="e106">How Does Movie Emperor Mickey Rooney Relax? <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Shui</p>
<p>Mentioning the name Mickey Rooney is really famous, who doesn't know it? Who doesn't know it? He is the movie emperor of Hollywood, and he is also the protagonist of the "Hardy Family" movies. On the screen, he is a lively and clever big kid, and he is a funny and humorous big role. But do you know what he does in his spare time? Reading, that's right, what else does he do besides reading? What is his favorite hobby? How does he spend his free time? We have to know that he is not only a star with superb acting skills on the screen, but also his special talents and success off the screen are no less than those in movies.</p>
<p>Versatile</p>
<p>He is one of the busiest people in Hollywood. In addition to acting, he is a composer, a band conductor, a magazine editor, a carpenter, and a ranch owner. Not long ago, he even hung up a sign and started a chicken egg business; you may also know that he is still learning to be a director.</p>
<p>Need for Hobbies</p>
<p>"You probably wouldn't think that my whole day's work is just making movies, would you?" he once said to a newspaper reporter. "No, I think everyone should have some hobbies. By hobbies, I mean not doing things that you like to do; I think hobbies are something that can restore your body and mind. It calls you to get up earlier in the morning and not lie in bed. It will call you to quickly restore your original spirit after working hard for eight hours." "So, whenever I have free time," he told us again, "I like to write songs. Sometimes I only write three or four lines, and sometimes I won't stop until the whole song is finished."</p>
<p>Amateur Writing</p>
<p>He is also a writer, you know? He has to review manuscripts for "Topper Magazine", sort out various articles about film production and criticism, and sometimes he has to proofread and design them himself. This magazine is published by several students studying at the university, so he is particularly interested in it. He hopes to know from here what things those college students who don't do anything and devote all their energy to books like to read?</p>
<p>Good at Playing Music</p>
<p>Finally, I should mention with great attention his "famous" band. This band was formed by him and several of his friends who like to play musical instruments. George Stoll is a violin master, Sid Miller plays the piano, and he writes good lyric songs. Mickey Rooney himself is a drummer. When a large number of guests come to his ranch or a dance party is held, they would rather not turn on the jazz music on the radio and like the band to play. Mickey always puts in a lot of effort and shows his skills. He said: "This is our best practice time!" In short, Mickey is an extremely clever, interesting, and progressive artist, and it is indeed not accidental that he has achieved his current position.</p>

<p>Rong Chun and Ming Chun compete to stage new operas</p>
<p>Rong Chun and Ming Chun are two small opera schools in Beiping. The former is presided over by Shang Xiaoyun. Perhaps because of the relationship of the host, they all like to study the forms of "scenery and dance". Rong Chun has been performing in the Zhonghe Theater for a long time, staging operas such as "Double Dragons Fighting Emei" and "Double Hearts Fighting", and also using words such as "strange love fairy tales, singing and dancing swordsmen" and "Dragon Pool scenery, five-color electric light" as slogans. Ming Chun performs in the Qingle Theater, staging operas such as "Tang Wang Tours Hell" and the continuous "Civet Cat for Crown Prince", and also uses words such as "novel scenery, amazing colors" as a guise. After watching these two opera schools, they have blindly embarked on the road of "suicide", which is really laughable.</p>
<p>Fu She and Opera School perform separately</p>
<p>Fu Liancheng and the Opera School are still more decent. Now Fu She Bai Fu is performing in the Huale Theater, but unfortunately, due to the lack of talents, its appeal is not as strong as Rong Chun and Ming Chun. As for the Opera School, since its disbandment due to some reasons, several actors have established their own banners and formed separate troupes. Recently, a group of students, under the name of "Opera School Students' Summer Cooperation", performed in the Chang'an Theater, with operas such as "Nao Xue", "Sao Song", "Ci Bajie", and "Deyi Yuan". After Hou Yulan graduated from the school, she joined the troupe as a main female role. Recently, I heard that someone has brought her together with Bai Yuwei to cooperate in an opera, and the repertoire has been set as "Three Women's Love". This opera was originally one of the small-scale erotic dramas compiled by the "Opera School". The original leading actors, in addition to Hou and Bai, also included Li Yuru. Now that Wang Ruyu and Wei have each formed their own troupes, it is not easy to cooperate, so the role played by Yuru can only be sought elsewhere.</p>

<p>His father was a famous pianist, so he wanted him to inherit his career and become a musician. His mother wanted him to be a lawyer, but Melvyn himself wanted to be a fireman. He had already shown his dramatic talent in high school. Later, he worked in a joint-stock company and performed Shakespeare's famous plays in his spare time. Although he played various roles, he was quite successful. Thus, he established his position in the silver screen. He is an outstanding comedian, comparable to Cary Grant.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow One's Head in the Wilderness</p>
<p>Xu Jing waited for them to call out once, and a stone flew out of his hand, hitting the left eye of a wolf. The wolf ate a stone. The pain was extraordinary, and it cried even more miserably. Only because Xu Jing was high in the tree, he couldn't do anything to him, but just jumped. After a while, Xu Jing flew out another stone, hitting the wolf's neck. This stalemate lasted for a long time, and Xu Jing sent out a total of eight stones, each hitting the target. The two wolves were also exhausted from jumping, and they didn't get any advantage. They couldn't bite people, and they were reluctant to leave. Xu Jing looked at their exhausted and hoarse appearance, and knew that the two wolves were already unable to do anything. He jumped down, waved the Red Phoenix Sword, and went straight for their vitals. When the two wolves saw Xu Jing descending from the tree, they still tried their best to pounce on Xu Jing, but their strength was exhausted after all, and they couldn't get close to Xu Jing's body. Xu Jing used the sword quickly, and when the white light quickly fell, one of the wolves had already fallen to the ground. Only one wolf was left. Xu Jing was even more determined, and fought with the wolf for a while. When the wolf pounced on his head, he swept away with his sword, hitting the wolf's left front paw. The wolf rolled to the ground, and just as it was about to get up again, Xu Jing slashed down again, cutting the wolf in two. Xu Jing killed three wolves in a row, and a few drops of blood splashed on his body. He looked around with his sword in hand, and his demeanor suddenly felt majestic. He couldn't help but sing aloud:</p>
<p>The sky is vast and the clouds are boundless, I carry my sword out of the fortress with lofty aspirations, I will destroy those demons like jackals!</p>
<p>After singing several songs, Liu Yingying had already walked back from the foot of the mountain. Seeing Xu Jing standing outside the door with his sword in hand, a wolf hanging from the tree, and two dead wolves lying on the ground, he couldn't help but feel very surprised. He asked, "Brother Jing, did these jackals die under your sword?" Xu Jing then told him the story of how he successively killed the three wolves. Liu Yingying said happily: "Brother Jing is both intelligent and brave, and can kill three wolves alone. In the future, when you wipe out the bandits, you can also mow the grass and kill them happily." Xu Jing sighed: "Bandits are everywhere, and the beacon fire is not extinguished. The world is full of them. Where can I get 100,000 horizontal grinders to kill all the clowns?" The two went into the door together and closed the door. Liu Yingying sat down with Xu Jing for another moment, then went to pack his luggage, put the things he wanted to bring into his suitcase, and drank with Xu Jing until the second watch in the evening before going to bed.

<p>Wu Suqiu's Filming Has Problems</p>
<p>According to Li Zhihua of the Minhua Propaganda Department, "Recently, there have been many rumors outside about Minhua. Some of these rumors are due to a reason, but some have no 'reason' at all. It is true that Minhua recently suspended filming before September 15 due to the problem of the studio, and it is even more true that they are actively preparing for the next new film during this month and a half. Minhua's next new film has already been internally decided to be a fashion film, directed by Fei Mu. In addition, Sima Yingcai took advantage of the fact that Minhua had a month and a half of free time on the studio to return to his hometown to visit his mother, and on the way, he decided to write out his long-planned 'Lonely Island Scenery'. This is also 'seizing the time.' As for the rumors that Wu Suqiu will be invited to shoot another Pingju movie, that's just someone who occasionally mentioned this idea to Jin Xinmin at a banquet. In fact, Wu Suqiu is far away in Beiping, so it's too early to say."</p>
<p>Zhang Jun, the person in charge of Lianxing, who is currently preparing, admitted that he had this idea long ago, and his tone implied that he had already started negotiations. According to the reporter's observation, even if there is some certainty in inviting Wu Suqiu, the cost may not be close. Currently, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Beiping is quite different. Zhou Shilingren's invitation to film is regarded as a way to make money, and if Wu Suqiu is invited, it is inevitable that she will ask for a high price.</p>
