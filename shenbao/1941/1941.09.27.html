<p>社評</p>
<h3>朝氣與正義</h3>
<p>朝氣者，平旦之氣也；長空一碧，露濕草新，心境開朗，神志淸明，此朝氣也。翳古孟子善養氣，所養者爲浩然之氣。文天祥善言氣，混處於七氣之中，以一敵七，一者正氣也。兩漢尙節義，故中經王莽之篡竊，而漢祚仍綿延。兩晋尙淸談，只圖閒適，不知有家國。卒召五胡亂華，分崩蕩析，生靈塗炭者數百年。淸末起革命，赴湯蹈火，志士成仁，所不顧也、淸社以屋；然所以激勵民氣者，明末淸初義士仁人之碧血長存耳！夫此，皆有氣鼓之使然。氣之爲氣，目不可得見，手不可得捫，然其充塞宇宙內，深入人心中，威足以撼山岳，和足以通感應，力至柔而實至剛。形至隱而成就之事績最著。故正氣也，浩然之氣也，朝氣也，修養有深淺，成就有大小，而其得氣之正，得情之醇，合於義理之蘊，則一也。</p>
<p>朝氣者，如銛鋒之刀礪於硎，新鍊之鋼淬於水，即孔子所謂血氣之剛也，以靑年得之爲最多。靑年者，入世未深，本性未漓，淸白其心，砥礪其行，故富於正義感。如近代中國文化政治經濟思想事業之推進，發動於靑年者良多。蓋靑年不知有權威，亦不畏惡勢力，惟知其所當是者是之，非者非之，利害禍福所不暇計，聲色貨利所不能動，是即孟子所謂「之所不學而能者，其良能也；所不慮而知者，其良知也。」然而涉世愈深者則不然，畏忌多端，顧慮百出、一言惟恐開罪人，一語惟恐攖彼怒，畏首畏尾，其用心良苦，其意氣愈消沉。世又以磨稜倒角爲圓通，八面玲瓏爲周到，以奉迎趨候惟恐稍後，察顏觀色惟恐不周，唯唯諾諾惟恐不及，爲能善處世。於是善惡不明，邪正不分，惟有勢者是附，惟有利者是趨，此皆暮氣爲之厲也。</p>
<p>暮氣者，塵濁之氣也。經鎭日之塵氛擾攘，動物之吐故納新，此淸明之氣，所以化爲塵濁。既暮矣，則又如孔子所謂血氣既衰，戒之在得。得者，貪着也；一有貪着，則是非顚倒，黑白淆亂，明知爲正義，而不敢道，明知爲曲直，而不敢辨，好以枉道從人，而賢者短氣。社會中惡勢力之敢於潛滋暗長，疋爲此耳！</p>
<p>迺者如項束川斃於車下，挺身而出，不畏强禦，大有身蹈不測之淵，而仍到庭作證，白死者之寃，惟聖約翰中學學生蔣靖一人而已！蔣靖者，可決其爲富於朝氣血性人道觀念之青年也。不然，以盈車之人，坐視項君之死，豈皆漠然無動於中乎！日：不然；惻隱之心，人皆有之，見人之死，而漠然無動於中者，非人也，雖殺人者，亦必有動於心，特欺死者之不能言，而欲卸其罪責，自逭刑綱耳！第不念易地相處，所殺傷者為其親屬故舊，彼內心之爲悲傷抑鬱，抑亦以殺人者爲寃枉否乎？至不敢爲死者鳴不平，夫豈內心不疚，又豈無動於中，亦豈不有兎死狐悲之感，固惟恐樹怨懷恨，挾持尋仇。而自遭不測耳！於是寗置之度外，甯放棄正義、甯箝口結舌，更以見蔣靖之仗義，彌覺靑年之朝氣可貴，不然，項君固枉死，且將蒙死者自不小心之咎，寃乎吾乎？然亦賴有摘姦發伏，依法檢舉，不則蔣靖雖義憤塡膺，亦奚能爲。又得保障人權，不以生死而殊；高明在上，能雪死者之枉，而知證人見義勇爲，是皆正氣之所鍾也。世嘗謂正氣銷沉，不圖於此一案，而社會之正氣，鬱鬱葱葱，蔚爲人道之堡壘，由是而知黑暗社會之中，尙有光明在；在瀾既傾之候，猶有保障在；吾則跬步皆荊棘，人命如草芥，危乎吾乎？</p>
<p>惟是朝氣者，血氣之勇也；血氣剛易爲折；故曰毋暴其氣，貴乎能養，尤貴乎善養其氣，此孟子所謂「配義與道，無是餒也。」今將使靑年學子，聞風興起。發揮其正義感；再得良師之敎育培植，社會之獎勵扶掖，行見朝氣磅礴，一掃塵濁之暮氣，而後知民族重光之非爲難也，</p>

<p>戰時的美國京城華盛頓，終於實現了當初設計者的理想。這座位於巴陀馬克河畔的小城快要長成了。法國著名建築師狼芳少校理想中的「聯邦之都」畢竟實現了。現在的華盛頓，巳不復如英國小說家迭更斯所描寫的，僅僅是「一座追懷幻想的紀念坊；其廣闊的街道，起自烏何有之鄉，適往烏何有之鄕一了，它已成爲西半球的戰時首都，一個如火如荼人山人海的大都會，是軸心的夢魔，是民治陣錢的希望，甚至於迭更勘心目中的淪敦也唯它馬首是瞻呢。</p>
<p>試從華盛頓紀念塔的頂上，俯瞰晨光稀微中的都會全景。圖案型的大街在朝日輝映中，伸向碧水淸出的邊緣。居高下望，它正如一个建築師的夢境，一個電氣開關造成的世界博覽會模範城市，一種光，影和動力，研究的對象，一个由直長的現代林蔭道和希臘羅馬時代古典的圓柱大厦神怪的混合物。</p>
<p>每天早晨一敲七點鐘，政府各機關就開始活動了。各機關公務員開始在城中集中。無數汽車，從高處望去，非常小巧玲瓏，都紛紛滾下維吉尼亞山，風馳電掣地穿過巴陀馬克河上各橋樑，在琴金期山國會大厦四周旋轉，最後停止下來，一輛一輛如機製硬殼蟲般排列在鬧市每條街道旁邊。這是巴陀爲克河生力軍每天開始侵略的悄形—這支軍隊巳改變了國都生活的全部氣氛和動態。</p>
<p>十九世紀末期，英國史家白賚士爵士論及南北戰爭後的美國說，美國是「常世唯一沒有首都的國家」，當時的華盛頓，不過是擁有十四萬七千二百九十三人口的蕞爾小城。迨入二十世紀，增加至二十七萬八千七百十八人，及至上决歐戰結束，叉增至四十三萬七千五百七十一人。一丸三三年羅斯法總統上台的時候，首都人口的爲四十八萬八千人。目下因政府人員集中和國防工業繁榮之故，已增加至七十萬人以上，行見「大華盛頓」快要擁有人口百萬了。</p>
<p>這種劇變幾乎全部是新來的公務人員和他們的家眷造成的。當一九三三年六月問，首都僅有公務人員六萬五千四百三十七名；現在巳有十七萬名以上，較上决歐戰時期最高紀錄，多五萬二千名。單是去年一年中，政府添用新人就達四萬名之譜，同時全城的人口也驟增七萬五千名左右。</p>
<p>首都高速度變化結果，百難叢生。繫榮已普及社會的各方面；它影響到生活費用，　成各種新的社會問題，改變了大部份人的工作時開和生活情形，擴大了都會的社交生活和夜生活，而整個華盛頓未來問題，又復展在面前了。</p>
<p>首以社會的變遷而論，常從往的方而說起，除掉戰爭和羅斯福總統外，住的問題殆巳成爲談話的中題。去年，公務員四萬人申，大約有百分之八十，每星期都付三十八美元以下的房金，他們都願出四十美元一月的代價找尋房屋。房屋的需要如此殷切，至今年一月間止，全城房屋早已租賃一空。據國會委員會報吿，一千九百七十二個覓求房屋的公務員家庭中，僅六百零五家如願以償。</p>
<p>公寓的缺乏情形亦然。去年八月間，即眞正的繁榮開始後一個月，全城公寓房屋有百分之七·九四，是空着的。到九月一日，空屋的比率己降到百分之五·九九，到今年三月一日，已减爲百分之一至百分之一·五一。及至今年耶穌復活節時，所有的公寓都已塞足了。</p>
<p>住居間題又運帶引起別的問題。房子求過於供，租金當然飛漲，房金一漲，那些住慣三十美元一月房子，雖不寬綽，却不失體而的家庭，都漸漸被迫搬到比較簡陋的區域去了。有許多家庭不得不分租。收入最少的階級，多至八家合住一所，八個屋問的住宅，廿四人合用一問浴室。這種情形是衛生局的難題，國會委員會現已着手調查。</p>
<p>同時，當局對於去年下半年以來，從全國各地來京上萬婦女的住宿問題，也感棘手。今年初，政府添用女打宇員及速記員一萬二千名以上。在私人住宅獨關一室，久已不可能，靑年婦女現都三兩成羣，在陋巷區域，租一開屋子同住，而公務委員會還要向全國招添成萬打字員和速記員呢（未完）華盛頓之夜景</p>

<h3>滬進口物品價格飛漲　平準會應速制止</h3>
<p>今日出版之密勒氏評論報載有海上名經濟學家安翰能（即阿勒斯）所撰之專論一篇、促平準基金會制止進口商壟斷居奇之惡風、茲譯其大要如决、「向平準基金會獲得賤價外匯、須符合若干條件、獲得外匯者、不得參予黑市交易、須將出口匯票按平準匯　結售、更須防止平準會所給之匯或藉所給外匯進口之貨物、落入極權國家曁不合作方面之手、但凡此種種、渠能盡如平準會規定合理實行耶</p>
<p>利用漏罅　實行專賣</p>
<p>顯然、本埠進口商向平準會求結外匯、較之其他進口商、其地附著極為優越、在多方面、獨有彼等能得所經營貨物之進口、因此造成若干小專賣商、而本埠行商受此種情形之誘惑、儘量利用其新得之半專賣地位獲利者、日有增加、商人本性難移、欲望其不趁此新機會獲得意外利潤、不營緣木求魚、此種利用平準會政策一時之漏罅之誘惑、至爲强烈、故平準基金會必須防止對於所給外匯進口貨物之壟斷與操縱</p>
<p>進口行商　空前獲利</p>
<p>自英荷美凍結中日資金兩個月以來、實際上所有進口貨物價格飛漲、而猶在繼續騰貴中、此種價格之高漲、較之外國製造商價格、水脚及運費匯率之增加、遠有過之、太平洋航綫美輪載貨兵險率之降低、在進口商視若無睹、而猶叫囂不絕、藉口水脚高漲、頻抬價格、但實際上無非有意操縱居奇而已、且平準會結匯政策之實行、形成進口品之减少、而市塲之需要較前爲大、物價增加、在所當然核准物品之進口商、遂得空前獲利、卒使零售價格大量增高、此種發展實非所宜、</p>
<p>斷然取締　襲斷囤積</p>
<p>一平準基金會得有極好之理由、竪立下列兩項原則、以限制對滬市所需外滙之供給、（一）平準會結匯進口物品、不准壟斷居廳、此種物品須照平常合法商人利益出售、不准逾分、新貨價格須按平準會規定匯率計算、本地存貨須照新貨計值出售、（二）平準會結匯進口貨物、不准囤積、必需於市塲需要時出售、如求過於供、進口商須用分攤方法分配供給、所需買主之實際消費、而非其儲藏之量、貨品攤派、對國儲者一律拒絕、雖十四家銀行已在考慮此事、尙望平準會本身能採取決斷之行動、此種原則、雖巳應用於工部局米之進口、但其他結匯物品、亦須一體辦理也」、</p>

<h3>售票推死乘客　判無期徒刑　偽證部份繼續偵訊　教唆偽證併予扣押</h3>
<p>本市各路電事賣票員楷油之風歷時已久、雖經電車公司加派查票及其他辦法、然迄未能獲得有效制止之方法、乃本月十三日、竟發生因賣票揩油不遂推斃乘客之慘案、</p>
<p>推跌身死</p>
<p>緣有項　川者、於是日乘坐二十路無軌電車、因賣票員三五八號海門人王萬祥、於收受車資後、不給車票、項向案未遂、該售票員反惱羞成怒、在威海衛路同孚路口、將項由車推下跌傷致死、經捕房將王拘捕、解送特一法院、由聖約翰中學學生蔣靖激於正曦、不畏強暴、到庭作證、</p>
<p>串出偽證</p>
<p>而被吿方面竟勾串評價蔣靖之房客無賴嚴德發到庭、作遠背良心道德之虛僞證言、經工部局代表律師張天蔭·承審推事石美瑜·發覺其奸、予以扣留、發交檢察處偵查、業由檢察官吳啓華飭令收押、候偵查完畢、依法訴究在案、</p>
<p>無期徒刑</p>
<p>至王萬祥部份、捕房初依殺人、罪起訴、旋經張律師　改傷害人致死罪請求依該條之最高刑處以無其徒刑、以　將來、而項東川之家屬、亦委蔣保　　屏藩律師附帶民訴、業經訊供終結、聽候宜判、昨晨此案為宜宣判之期、由石美瑜推事升座刑二庭宣告判決、主文、王萬祥傷害致人於死、處無期徒刑、　　公權終身、附帶民訴、移送本院民庭審判、</p>
<p>偽證部份</p>
<p>又嚴應發偽證部份、昨午後又經吳啓　檢察日開放作第二次之偵查、原案證人蔣靖之母、亦被傳到庭、據其供述、調嚴曾同其稱、死者巳死、何必究治、而電車公司賣票有三千人之多、若能對活者（指王萬祥）予以幫助、則三千資票每人出資一元、亦可得三千金、若人出十元、則可得三萬金等詞、而吳檢察官昨並傳電車公司二百四十一號賣票鎭江人米實林到庭作證、</p>
<p>嚴予偵查</p>
<p>經偵訊之結果、知嚴之到庭作虛偽之陳述、即係米及其同事等之敎唆、故亦飭令收押、候與嚴　發併偵查明晰後、并行起訴、據悉教唆偽證者尙非米一人、更有其他賣票參項、故法院正儼密查究、以爲藐視人命玩法之流者戒、</p>
<h3>希望與策勵（三）　寫在工商組助學金後　第四十號申請人撰</h3>
<p>策勵</p>
<p>申報會說「爲善最樂」，听以凡輸款者爲求心之所安，並不斤兩於個人的功績。我們得其助者，不能認有恥辱；相反，由於我們的辛勤，而取得的同情與援助，正表示了我們的含辛茹苦沒有白費。這樣，我們今日的得助，是一件極榮耀的事。且又不同於一般子弟。所以凡得助之道友，應自尊，自愛，永遠辛勞，永遠努力，永遠能受社會人士的同情，此乃必須認識之一。</p>
<p>今日的時代，我們的地位與捐斡者期望的殷切，實不能存有一分一秒開散的心，而急須拼命直上，以二步併一步走，此乃必須認識之二。</p>
<p>學識不是私有的工具，我們今日接受先人過去的經騐，則明日必須將現在我們所有的生活體騐及事務實情，產生另一個經騐，作爲　來的張本，是為求學的真責任。八月二十一日申報社論說：「今日受們於社會，明日必千百倍還之於社會」；此乃不減的眞理，亦即自助助人的最要涵莪。我們必須認識之三。</p>
<p>本位努力及最簡捷的盡飛方法，今日旣得人之同情及各經理的優惠，那麽，我們應該自滿，敬業，樂業，視職業爲事業，全力以赴，不懶惰，不厭業。愛護行號公司，視同我的家庭。當局獨厚於我，我焉能不以誠相還，此乃認識之四。</p>
<p>世道人心，皆見於每僩人之品格，儘多飽學之士，而無端正的品格及正當的人生態度，皆不足以稱完人。所以我們須在職務上，私生活上，極端嚴肅個人生活不花天酒地，不入奢侈的塲所。如此個人有良好品格，方能推己及人，受淑景仰，爲社會樹模範，爲未來的新中國手雷下一顆美好的種子，此須認識之五。</p>
<p>「報德」實是次要，「做人却居首位。我們能自愛做人質樸的品格，純潔的心願，熱烈愛護國家，忠心服務社會，亦就是「。報德」一·所以我們得助者與其急須「報德」，還不是格守本位，努力「做人」。要做像一個人。則於後繼者之前，才不愧爲大哥，而也實現了申報服務社會及捐　者已立立人的初衷了。</p>
<p>得助諸友！今日的世界，烽火燃遍；公理與正義，有待新生侖爲其滋長。人類的福祉，有持年靑的一代爲其創造。而我民族耀煌的前途，更有待我們刻苦砥礪，合力的奮鬥。親愛的學友！人生短促，責任鉅車，我於此學期之始，願與諸學友互策而共勉之！（三十年九月十三日深夜畢）</p>

<h3>三個問題</h3>
<p>— 簫雲</p>
<p>據一位新從外國回來，在國際靑年學界中担任工作的先生說，此决歐戰發生以後，各國靑年智識份子，在思想上有了很明顯的變動。他們所特別注意的有以下三個問題：</p>
<p>第一，在這動亂的世界上，武力倒底佔甚麼地位？强權是不是要取公理而代之？暴力是至上的嗎？</p>
<p>第二，在這貧富懸殊有如天壞之別的社會上，經濟機構是吾有加以調整的必要？應該怎樣去加以調整呢？</p>
<p>第三，國際聯盟可說是壽終正寢了。世界上已經沒有國際性的仲裁團體存在。此决戰事結束以後，各國是吾將另外組織類似的團體？應該用甚麽形式去組織，才可以避免未來的戰禍？</p>
<p>未來的世界是屬於這一代的靑年的。各國的靑年智識份子有這樣的觀念與思想，是値得慶賀的。從靑年所思考的這幾個問題上看來，我們敢斷定我們將有一個更好的更合理的世界。</p>

<h3>戰時的英倫學童</h3>
<p>— 江新亮</p>
<p>在英國的五百萬名學童中，有一百多萬倒是居住於倫敦的。自倫敦撤退的學童，迄今還祇有十一萬二千餘名，此中計有九萬名在目前得不到任何形式的敎育。</p>
<p>在今日的倫敦，所謂『强迫敎育』巳經不復存在了。戰前，原有的那些督舉員，他們的職責就是去各個家庭中訪問，察看有巳經到達入學年齡的孩童，敦促家長們趕快送他們進校，吾則就該受到罰金與坐獄等責罰；可楚如今這種挺好的制度巳完全停頓了。</p>
<p>第一，督學員爲了要幫助人民撤退的緣故而不再工作。第二，孩子們撤退的除所大多都不能探悉。他們也許去另一郡或鄉了，他們也許進其他的學校了，結果呢，即使要强迫孩實們人學，亦根本無從强迫起。母親們知道了這一點，於是就不送子女云讀書了。</p>
<p>大家或者會說，學生少了之後，在管敎方面當能週到些，這却亦不盡然。學生的數目旣能减少，敎師的數員自然也會低减。事實上，的確有許多男女敎師巳被當地政府徵去作各項戰時的服役。像往防空壕中照顧那些無家可歸的孩子，就是此種服務之一。他們說：『是呀，我們知道我們的責任原是敎書，但是在目前，那些孩子都不能照常出席，即使是來的，學生也全是沒精打采地讀不好書；在醒着的時候，他們的腦海中仍充滿了轟炸的恐怕與槍砲的威脅。那麼，還是讓我們來做這種救護工作來得較有意義些。』</p>
<p>又有人在說啦：爲什麽不在防空地洞中教孩子呢？關於這一點，困難也很多。設備的不完全，沒有檯子沒有書籍，沒有墨水，燈光惡劣，閱讀艱難。在這種情形下讀書用功，反而會使孩童們受到體力上與精神上的損害。何况經過幾决撒退之後，學生星散，編級分班等事務，均感棘手；把程度參差，年齡相去頗遠的孩子一們合併在一起敎授，處處覺到不能討好呢。</p>
<p>戰事予一國的影響，首先及於敎育。在現在這種無理的，野蠻的進攻之下，敵方的飛機是顧不到什麽文化不文化的，它們任意轟炸，終于使孩童們在流離失所之餘，更嚐到失學的痛苦。但是英國當局有鑒於敎育在戰事中所佔地位之重要，刻正竭力於『强迫敎育』制度的恢復，務使孩童們要與『先生』一同撤退，幷使鄕間的住屋改成戰時臨時校舍，以便繼續上課，不令孩子的學業有荒廢之可能。</p>
<p>這雖然要費相當的錢，但預算總計亦僅及目前一天戰爭的消耗—五千萬元而已。</p>
<p>史話</p>
<h3>鶻與鴨</h3>
<p>— 祝敔</p>
<p>（艾子新解之五）</p>
<p>趙王手下有個名將叫趙奢，因爲建了不少功勳被封爲馬服君。馬服君的威名插滿了全個趙國。</p>
<p>馬服君有個寳貝兒子叫趙一括，靠了他老子，也威名四佈一，實際上呢，一點本領都沒有</p>
<p>這時候，秦國來伐趙。趙王相信遺傳學的，以爲有其父趙奢，必有其子趙括，就擢趙括爲總司令，叫他去抗秦。</p>
<p>「兒呀，承王擢用，這决去要好好幹它一番。」馬服君臨別囑咐。</p>
<p>「爸爸，請放心，兒子此云總凱旋回來就是」趙括意氣洋洋地說。</p>
<p>說是沒有用的，要看眞本領。趙括同秦將武安君自起交鋒，那裏會是對手？趙括給活捉云了，送了四十萬趙兵，趙國幾因此不救。</p>
<p>這件事給艾于聽到了，就發了一頓議論。</p>
<p>從前有個人要打獵，想買一只鶻，但不識，買了一只鴨回來。他帶了那只冒牌的鶻去打獵。遠處來一只兎子，他把它向空一擲，它却跌了下來，再擲再跌，它忍痛爬起來用人的話說：</p>
<p>「先生，我是鴨呀，把我殺了吃也可以，幹嗎把我擲個不停？」</p>
<p>「我想你是一只會獵兔的鶻呀！」</p>
<p>鴨舉起掌來笑著說：「看我道脚手，那裏會搏兎呢？」</p>
<p>世界上有許多事本來可以做成功的，但因用人不當而貽大息於後。要使政治上軌道，先要看看辦理政治的人脚手才好呀。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦慶鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>聽的人想想倒也很對，但孟老掌櫃還是死命纏着他，要他想想在樟樹屯裏，和附近各處，他有幾家熟人，那一家和林生有過仇隙；但秋海棠是已經受過玉崑的囑咐了，當然竭力推托，始終說想不起來。</p>
<p>「我瞧這樣吧！」大家相持了半天，張老六便出來貢獻了一個折中辦法。「咱們三爺不妨再多給孟老爺子想想，看有沒有路可走；一方面孟老爺子也可以趕快派人上四處去找，或是爽快到北河鎭去報警察局。只要大家一齊出力，小掌櫃的遲早總可以找回來。」</p>
<p>孟家的一班人也覺得除此以外，別無他法，便祇能道了謝，快快地退回去。</p>
<p>『事情也眞巧，咱們的梅寳姑娘還沒有回來，你們倒又丟了一位小掌櫃，這是什麽世界？」張老六送他們到門口邊去的時候，忍不住很俏皮地這樣說。</p>
<p>孟老掌櫃的心裏有病，聽了倒不由突然一震。</p>
<p>「哦！這件事怕有些蹊蹺！」他一路走過街去，心裏暗暗這樣想。</p>
<p>後來他上北河鎭警察分局去報吿的時候，便把自己心裏所懷的疑團，也連帶吿訴了那一位李巡長。（二二二）</p>

<h3>吳素秋婚變記（上）</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>（北平航訊）在上海鬧着影星婚變的當見，古都的北平，也不甘寂寞，不少的正在紅着的坤伶，她們的艶聞也傳變了九城。下面便是剛在上海紅了起來以紡棉花起家的坤伶吳素秋的一椿風流公案。</p>
<p>吳素秋是北平戲曲學校的學生，她在校名吳蘊玉，除了容貌秀麗以外，唱作工夫還差，因此，她也祇能在四郎探母襄飾個八姊九妹而巳，總之，是個掃邊的角色。不過因爲面孔俏麗的關係，便不免東勾西搭，當時很有幾個男同學和她要好。唱老生的王和霖，便與她最知己。戲校某一次出外公演，王吳二人，便乘機發生了變愛。彼時，這椿風流公案，曾共動了整個戲校，並且在北京梨園界，也頗嘖嘖人口。戲校因爲「校譽」關係，不能不稍有表示，然而彼時的王和霖，正在學生中頂紅的時代，戲校公演，大軸十九是他的，怎好辦呢？於是吳素秋便在那時，被戲校以「肅正校風」的理由而開除了。這是「秋兒」在戲校時的一頁風流史，也是她和王和霖的婚姻的起源。這是十年以前的事情。</p>
<p>滄桑幾度吳素秋紅了</p>
<p>吳素秋的母親，是交際家，是下臺的明星，手腕極玲瓏。她看透了她女兒是個可居的奇貨，她努力的裝飾她，知道必有一天貨遇買主。自從吳素秋出校以後！她便給她另聘名師敎戲，不久就搭班出演，混了幾年。其間，隨金少出到過東北，最後，獨組一班，到滬出演。憑着「秋兒」的姿態，和她母親的交際，幾塲紡棉花唱後，吳素秋三字，便深深地印在人們的腦海裏。而她們母女呢？自然名利雙收。這時候，王和霖在戲校畢業了，可是也倒了嗆，嗓子一變，戲是不能唱了。乾看着愛人吳素秋一天比一天紅起來。</p>
<p>愛情變化佳人別屬</p>
<p>吳素秋紅了，交際更寬，識人更多，北平有名的八大少，足跡不離「秋兒」的香閨，鹽商公子查二少，東興樓少東何二爺黑龍江督軍吳俊升的侄少爺……總而言之，這些紈桍膏梁子弟，蒼蠅逐臭般地追隨，孝子賢孫般地伺候，一九四〇年的新式汽車，不斷地在吳宅門口來去。於是乎「秋兒」的芳心活動了。看看那倒了嗆不知何日才能恢復，即恢復也不知何日才能紅起來的王和霖，實在要不得。</p>

        <h1>1941.09.27</h1>
<h3>Pingjiang, South of Jiangnan, Suffered Interception by Japanese Troops; Chinese Troops Launched General Counter-offensive on the South Bank of the Miluo River; Fierce Seesaw Battles Occurred in Areas Such as Luo Jiaqiao and Jinjing; Japanese Troops in Guangdong Invaded Northward from Guangzhou in Two Routes</h3>
<p>Chongqing, Military News: (1) The war on the northern Hunan front has already unfolded into an extremely fierce seesaw battle. On the 25th, Chinese troops in areas near Xinguanshi, Luo Jiaqiao, Tuo Jiaqiao, Jinjing, and other places, valiantly intercepted the invading Japanese troops facing them and launched fierce counter-offensives. They charged back and forth, with each side gaining and losing ground. Japanese and Chinese casualties were heavy. Chinese troops fought bravely, imbued with high morale. As of noon on the 26th, Chinese and Japanese forces were still fiercely fighting in areas near these locations. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Changde: The Japanese troops attacking Pingjiang have repeatedly received reinforcements, reaching over 8,000 men. They have been engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops in the Jinjing area for days. By the morning of the 25th, all Japanese troops invading Jinjing had been intercepted. Japanese casualties were increasingly heavy. The remaining Japanese forces in Pingjiang are currently being cleared out. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Changde: Chinese troops south of the Miluo River launched a full-scale offensive last night, achieving considerable results. The Japanese troops harassing areas near Wengjiang suffered extremely heavy casualties and their momentum has been greatly diminished. As for the Japanese warships on the surface of Hengling Lake, although they have been constantly sending reinforcements, they have not succeeded because Chinese troops are firmly defending the lake shore. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to recent frontline reports, the vanguard of the Japanese army has advanced to a point about 30 miles from Changsha. Although Vienna claims to have contained the Japanese army advancing southward along the Yuehan Railway, two columns advancing southwest along the highway and advancing south through the small mountains between the railway and the highway appear to still be advancing rapidly. One column of the Japanese army crossed the Miluo River at Wukou, initially advancing southeast, but when it reached the highway near Wengjiangpu, it turned southwest again. It is heard that after the Japanese army broke through the Chinese army's defense line at Jinjing, its vanguard is now approaching Gaoqiao. At the same time, a central column has advanced to a certain location near Fulinpu (transliteration). In other words, the Japanese army has once again reached the line it reached two years ago. It now remains to be seen whether Xue Yue, the Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan Provincial Chinese Army, can turn the tide before the gates of Changsha. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Official military news states that the Chinese army launched a general counter-offensive on the south bank of the Miluo River in northern Hunan on Wednesday evening, hoping to stop the Japanese army's attack on Changsha, and claimed that it had reduced the Japanese army's offensive power. The Japanese army reached Jinjing yesterday, where fierce fighting is still taking place, but the vanguard of the Japanese army has been unable to make further progress. There is also still fighting northwest of Jinjing, and there is also separate fighting in Xinshi further west. (Associated Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The offensive of the Japanese army in Guangdong Province seems to echo the offensive in Hunan Province. The Japanese army in Guangzhou is advancing northward in two routes, one from a certain point northwest of Zengcheng, and the other looking north at Shengang on the east side of the Yuehan Road. The Japanese army in the lower reaches of the West River is also extremely active. The Japanese army that recently landed in Guanghai has occupied Santai (transliteration) to the north. A column departing from Xinhui is currently advancing west. Most opinions believe that the development of the Japanese army's offensive in Guangdong Province will largely depend on the outcome of the Battle of Changsha. If the Japanese army on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway wins, the Japanese army in Guangzhou will also launch a large-scale northern attack in order to occupy the entire Yuehan Railway line. (Reuters dispatch of the 20-somethingth)</p>
<p>Changde: Since the Japanese army decided to invade northern Hunan, it has suffered fierce blows from the Chinese army everywhere and has suffered extremely heavy casualties. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Changde: On the afternoon of the 23rd, part of the Japanese army advanced from Yueyang to Houtouzou near Jiyuan and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Changde: A telegram from a certain location near the coast states that a Japanese warship sunk by the Chinese army near Douqianzui on the south bank of Hengling Lake has been found. It is a gunboat with two large cannons, several machine guns, and a large amount of ammunition and parts. All of these have been dismantled by the Chinese army and sent to the rear. The local people lined the streets to watch. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Changsha: Dozens of Japanese planes bombed Changsha in shifts on the morning of the 25th. In the afternoon, Japanese planes bombed Yuelu Mountain again. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing, Military News: The Japanese army has reached Jinjing, 55 kilometers northeast of Changsha. Another Japanese column is continuing to advance westward and has established a new position 30 kilometers away on the south bank of the Miluo River. The Japanese army south of the Miluo River received reinforcements on Wednesday evening and appears to be advancing southward. (Associated Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops at Fushan</p>
<p>Suffered Defeat and Retreat</p>
<p>Xingji: On the morning of the 21st, a joint force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Fushan invaded China through Xiliangzhuang. Another force harassed Lijiapu. After the Chinese forces met the enemy head-on, the Japanese retreated to Fushan along the same route. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Part of the Japanese army from Hexin, Guzhen, and Xikou advanced to Dongyumen on the 17th and was repelled by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese army in the Longbeizhen area east of Yicheng attacked Qingcheng, Helu, Zhao City, and other places at dawn on the 19th. The Chinese army fiercely attacked the enemy at Zhao City and launched a fierce flanking attack with part of the army from Qinjiayi Ta. The Japanese army was defeated and fled in the afternoon. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops at Sanshui</p>
<p>Invaded Lubao</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: Over a thousand Japanese troops from Sanshui invaded Lubao along the Luxi Highway this morning and are engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army at Niulangang. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops who invaded Lougangshan from a certain location have been blocked and defeated by the Chinese army and have now retreated. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Achieved Repeated Victories</p>
<p>Shanggao: Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi have recently launched attacks on the Japanese army from multiple routes before and after the main force. They have achieved considerable results in the southeast of Nanchang and the Anyi-Nanxun Railway area in recent days. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest of Grain in Henan Province</h3>
<p>Luoyang: Henan Province has had a bumper harvest of food this year, with wheat production exceeding last year's by 651,290 shi, miscellaneous grains by 775,690 shi, and rice by 171,300 shi, for a total of 1,598,280 dan. Assuming that each person consumes five dan per year, this can feed 319,656 people for the entire year. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Smooth Progress in Collecting Land Tax in Kind in Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chengdu: The collection of land tax in kind in Sichuan Province has been progressing very smoothly since it began on the 16th of this month. The Provincial Land Tax Management Office has recently received reports from various counties stating that the general public is able to recognize the significance of collecting tax in kind and its importance to military supplies, civilian food, combat, and national construction. Everyone is enthusiastically transporting their grain. For example, in Guan County, although it was drizzling, the roads were slippery and muddy when the collection began, the farmers carried rice on their shoulders and flocked to the collection offices to pay their taxes. The income was extremely high on the first day of collection, and it has been very enthusiastic in recent days. The directors of the collection offices, seeing this situation, are all exceptionally excited, and many have volunteered to clear the entire amount within one month. They are currently adding more measures and preparing warehouses and intensifying operations. The situation in Pi County has also been quite good since the 16th. All subordinate offices are equipped with firecrackers and red silks to encourage those who pay early. Those who pay the food and rice competed to be the first. There are also many individuals who are enthusiastically transporting their grain. For example, Li Shuhua, the Garrison Commander of the evacuation area of ​​the Provincial Capital, as a soldier, in accordance with the instructions of the Chairman, took the lead in paying taxes for the grain purchased by the government to lead the way. However, as his native place is Suining, he has had a poor harvest this year and the rice harvest is not abundant. He has ordered the head of the Land Tax Management Office (who also serves as the director) to volunteer to agree with his clan to pay the grain that should be paid in Suining in Chengdu, and to pay the full amount first to advise the local area. It is heard that the Director of the Gansu Garrison replied with a sincere expression of agreement and requested that he apply to the Suining Land Tax Office to pay in Chengdu in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 of the Implementation Measures.

<p>Vigor refers to the spirit of early dawn; a clear blue sky, dew-covered fresh grass, a clear mind, and a clear spirit—this is vigor. Yi Gu of Mencius was good at cultivating his Qi, and what he cultivated was the Great Righteous Qi. Wen Tianxiang was good at talking about Qi, mixing it among the seven emotions, using one to fight against seven, the one being Righteous Qi. The two Han dynasties valued integrity and righteousness, so even after Wang Mang's usurpation, the Han dynasty was still able to continue. The two Jin dynasties valued pure conversation, only seeking leisure and comfort, and not caring about the country. In the end, they invited the Five Barbarians to wreak havoc on China, causing disintegration and destruction, and hundreds of years of suffering for the people. At the end of the Qing dynasty, revolutions arose, people went through fire and water, and heroes sacrificed themselves, not caring about anything, causing the Qing dynasty to collapse. However, what inspired the people's morale was the ever-lasting blood of righteous and virtuous people from the end of the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the Qing dynasty! This was all caused by Qi's encouragement. Qi as Qi cannot be seen with the eyes or touched with the hands, but it fills the universe and penetrates deeply into people's hearts. Its power is enough to shake mountains, and its harmony is enough to communicate feelings. Its strength is extremely soft but its essence is extremely firm. Its form is extremely hidden, but its achievements are the most remarkable. Therefore, Righteous Qi, Great Righteous Qi, and the vigor of the early dawn, the depth of their cultivation may vary, the size of their achievements may vary, but their correctness in obtaining Qi, the purity of their emotions, and their adherence to the principles of righteousness are all the same.</p>
<p>Vigor is like a sharp blade being sharpened on a grindstone, or newly forged steel being quenched in water; it is what Confucius called the firmness of blood and Qi. It is most often found in young people. Young people have not been deeply involved in the world, their original nature has not been diluted, their hearts are pure and their actions are rigorous, so they are full of a sense of justice. For example, the advancement of modern Chinese culture, politics, economics, thought, and career has largely been initiated by young people. This is because young people do not know authority, nor are they afraid of evil forces; they only know to affirm what is right and negate what is wrong. They do not have time to consider their own interests, misfortunes, or blessings, and they cannot be moved by sensual pleasures or wealth. This is what Mencius called, "What people are able to do without having learned it is their innate ability; what they know without having pondered over it is their innate knowledge." However, those who are deeply involved in the world are not like this. They have many fears and concerns. They are afraid of offending people with a single word, and they are afraid of angering others with a single sentence. They are fearful and hesitant. Their intentions are well-meaning, but their spirit becomes increasingly depressed. The world also regards smoothing out edges and corners as being well-rounded, and being sophisticated as being thoughtful. They only fear being late in flattering and pleasing others, and they only fear being inattentive in observing facial expressions and guessing intentions. They only fear being inadequate in saying "yes" and "agree," considering it to be skillful in dealing with the world. As a result, good and evil are not clear, and right and wrong are not distinguished. They only attach themselves to those in power and only pursue those with benefits. This is all the work of the stagnant Qi of old age.</p>
<p>Stagnant Qi is the Qi of dust and turbidity. After a day of dust and noise, and the exhalation and inhalation of animals, this clear Qi is transformed into dust and turbidity. Once it is stagnant, it is like what Confucius said about the decline of blood and Qi, which requires guarding against greed. Once there is greed, right and wrong are reversed, and black and white are confused. They know that something is righteous but dare not speak out; they know that something is crooked but dare not argue. They prefer to compromise and follow others, and virtuous people become short of breath. This is why evil forces in society dare to grow secretly!</p>
<p>Recently, when Xiang Shuchuan was killed by a car, only Jiang Jing, a student at St. John's Middle School, stepped forward, unafraid of the powerful, and went to court to testify, clearing the deceased of injustice, despite the risk of falling into an unfathomable abyss! Jiang Jing can be determined to be a young person full of vigor, blood, and humanitarian ideals. Otherwise, with a car full of people, watching Xiang's death, how could they all be indifferent and unmoved! It is said: That is not right; everyone has a heart of compassion. Those who are indifferent to the death of others are not human. Even murderers must be moved in their hearts, but they deceive the dead, who cannot speak, and want to shirk their guilt and evade punishment! They do not think that if the places were switched, the people killed or injured would be their relatives and friends. Would their inner sorrow and depression be less than their anger and hate for the murderer? As for not daring to speak out for the dead, how can their hearts not be pained, how can they not be moved, and how can they not have a feeling of sorrow for one's kind? They are only afraid of incurring resentment, harboring hatred, and seeking revenge, and of suffering misfortunes themselves! Therefore, they would rather put it out of their minds, rather abandon justice, and rather shut their mouths and tie their tongues. This further shows the value of Jiang Jing's righteousness and the value of the vigor of youth. Otherwise, Xiang would have died unjustly, and would have been blamed for his own carelessness, an injustice! However, it also depends on exposing evil and filing charges according to the law. Otherwise, even if Jiang Jing were filled with righteous indignation, what could he do? It also depends on protecting human rights, without distinction between life and death. Those in high positions can clear the injustice of the dead, and they know that witnesses are righteous and courageous. All of this is where Righteous Qi gathers. The world once said that Righteous Qi is declining, but it did not expect that in this one case, the Righteous Qi of society is lush and strong, forming a bastion of humanity. From this, we know that there is still light in a dark society, and that even when the situation is about to collapse, there is still protection. Otherwise, every step we take will be full of thorns, and human life will be like grass. How dangerous this is for us!</p>
<p>However, the vigor of youth is the courage of blood and Qi. Blood and Qi are easily broken; therefore, it is said that one should not be violent with one's Qi, but should value nourishing it, and especially value nourishing it well. This is what Mencius called, "Matching it with righteousness and the Dao, then it will not be starved." Now, we will make young students rise up upon hearing this and exert their sense of justice. With the education and cultivation of good teachers and the encouragement and support of society, we will see that vigor flourishes and sweeps away the stagnant Qi of dust and turbidity. Then we will know that the revival of the nation is not difficult.</p>

<h3>Paying Attention to Knowledge Training in the Military Construction Process</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chairman Jiang's call for officials, gentry, and their sons to enlist in the army has been quite effective. However, the difference between the level of knowledge and lifestyles of these sons and the soldiers who generally come from the working class is also an undisguised difficulty. The Conscription Department is deeply aware of this and has decided to advance the organization of modernized technical units in the military construction process and increase the number of units next year to absorb these sons in large numbers so that they can still develop their knowledge in the military service. Also, after the regimental management district is canceled, the number of divisions in each province will increase. Sichuan Province will increase from six to thirty starting in October.

<h3>One Week of Battle Situation: September 19 to 25</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Commission stated that since the war entered its fifth year, no matter what the results of the Japanese army's invasions in the northern and southern theaters, they have all ended in failure. In addition, with all the thorny and embarrassing issues in its domestic politics, economy, and diplomacy, the situation is precarious and shaky. Therefore, the Japanese army launched the Northern Hunan Battle, vainly hoping to gain something to alleviate international pressure and suppress domestic anti-war sentiment. The situation in Northern Hunan is described as follows: (1) The Japanese army first attacked Dayun Mountain on the 7th of this month, attempting to "mop up" the Chinese army's front-line field army, but unexpectedly failed completely and suffered considerable losses. In order to cover up its defeat and plan, the Japanese army gathered troops from various routes and launched a large-scale southern invasion. Therefore, starting from dawn on the 18th, the Japanese army on land invaded southward from Gangkou in multiple routes across the Xinqiang River and soon passed through Guanwangqiao, Dajing Street, and Doutouqiao. On the evening of the 19th, they advanced to Changlegjie, Wukou, Xinshi, Guiyi, and other places on the bank of the Miluo River. Due to strategic considerations, the Chinese army only fought back slightly and then retreated to the predetermined area. (2) As for the waterway, the Japanese army landed at Shangqingshan, which penetrated relatively deeply, but was always blocked by the Chinese army. As for attempts to land at Babai Gong, Yanjia Mountain, and Yingtian, they not only failed to succeed, but also had nine motorboats and more than 20 civilian ships sunk by the Chinese army. (3) After the Japanese army reached the north bank of the Miluo River, they began to cross the river southward in different directions at dawn on the 20th, but were suppressed by the Chinese army's firepower, and the crossing was limited and made no progress, and suffered considerable losses. One route in Guiyi was even forced to retreat. (4) At this time, the strong forces of the Chinese army on the north bank of the Miluo River began to exert their power. Before dawn on the 21st, they attacked the left flank of the Japanese army in the direction of Yanglin Street to Guanwangqiao. The morale of the Chinese army was high, and the Japanese army was overwhelmed. At Chenshi, the Japanese army of more than 10,000 people in the direction of Guanwangqiao was completely defeated and killed in large numbers. The Chinese army recaptured Guanwangqiao. (5) Since the Chinese army captured Guanwangqiao, the general situation of the Japanese army has been frustrated. Therefore, the Japanese army has increased reinforcements as much as possible to the rear control forces, resulting in more than 100,000 people gathered between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers. The number of those who have crossed the Miluo River is also about 20,000 to 30,000. They are invading southward in different directions and are now engaged in fierce fighting in the Qian area from Baishui in the south of Xinshi Wukou to Wengjiang. (6) The morale of the Chinese army on the front line is high. The Chinese Air Force also went to assist in the battle on the 23rd. Good news is expected sooner or later. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Japanese Activity in Southern Guangdong</p>
<p>(1) In order to echo the Battle of Northern Hunan, the Japanese army intends to create a false impression, so it is again active in various places in southern Guangdong. (2) On the 18th, part of the Japanese army in Shengang, with several artillery pieces, attacked Chicao to the north and shelled the Fuhuo Market northwest of Zengcheng towards the Baitianwang area. The Japanese army, which was also advanced to Pengyou and Xinqu that evening, was intercepted by the Chinese army and failed to succeed. (3) On the morning of the 20th, more than 5,000 Japanese troops were reinforced from Guangzhou to Xinhui, Jiangmen, and other places and were active westward in different directions. More than 1,000 Japanese troops who landed in Guanghai invaded northward. The Chinese and Japanese troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting near Danshuikou. Later, it was invaded, and the Chinese and Japanese armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs of Taishan City. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>

It was simple and solemn, expressing respect. As for the public burial, the estimated cost is 200,000 yuan. Xiao Zhenying and others donated 10,000 yuan today, and many others are expected to follow suit. The Ta Kung Pao itself is also prepared, so funding should not be a problem. Furthermore, Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie donated 1,000 yuan to the Zhang Jiluan Journalism Scholarship Fund. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing. According to sources from the preparatory committee for the public burial of Mr. Zhang Jiluan, the burial site will likely be in the scenic area on the south bank of Chongqing. The principle is that the funds will be raised by the press itself, and no external donations will be solicited. However, voluntary donations will be accepted. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>70,000 German Troops in the South Launch Fierce Attack on Crimea; Famous Soviet General Arrives at the Front to Assist in Command; Leningrad Red Army Counterattacks in Force</h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 26th. According to reports here, German troops in the south are launching a fierce offensive towards the Crimean Peninsula. The attacking German troops consist of four divisions, totaling 70,000 men. However, if the strength of the Soviet defenders is as strong as in other areas of the front, then four German divisions will be insufficient. The Crimean isthmus has strong defenses. Sailors from the Sevastopol naval base and aircraft from various bases on the Crimean Peninsula will assist in defending the peninsula. If the Germans use paratroopers and airborne troops like they did in the conquest of Crete, they will encounter far more difficulties with the Crimean Peninsula's defenders than they did with the Cretan defenders.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, New York, 26th. A New York Times correspondent in Moscow cabled that, according to a Moscow spokesperson this morning, the German offensive against Crimea has lasted for more than 24 hours. Initial detailed reports indicate that the Soviet army is confident in the battle situation. It is said that the German offensive began on Wednesday evening, starting with intensive bombing, followed by powerful troops, supplemented by tanks and mechanized units carrying out a ground attack. In addition, there was large-scale paratrooper activity. The Soviet army anticipated this and waited behind the minefields, holding its position. They witnessed a German regiment being blown to smithereens. Eight hours later, the German army retreated. The Soviet army's long- and short-range artillery positions in Amiansk and the Perekop Gulf began to converge fire, annihilating many. Although the German losses were heavy, they counterattacked again before noon yesterday. It is still unknown if their vanguard has broken through the Soviet lines.</p>
<p>Havas Dispatch, Stockholm, 26th. According to Moscow sources, the famous Soviet strategist General Shaposhnikov has rushed from Moscow to the Ukrainian front to assist General Budenny, the commander of the Southern Front, in directing the war. The actual commander of the Red Army is Stalin, but in reality it is Shaposhnikov.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 26th. A Reuters military commentator said that news from the Eastern Front is mixed and contradictory. Although both sides claim fierce fighting in Leningrad and Odessa, neither side seems to have made any progress in these two areas. The Germans are now claiming that the capture of Leningrad is a matter of two or three days, but the Germans have repeatedly made similar claims before. The tone of the Soviet communiqués and independent reports from Leningrad does not show any sign that the morale of the Soviet defenders has been shaken. The residents of the city seem to have an unbreakable spirit, enough to match the German army. In the central sector, the Soviet army has taken the initiative, launching local counterattacks, making some progress, and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, making the situation more stable.</p>
<p>International News Service Dispatch, Moscow, 26th. The Soviet High Command announced that although strong German mechanized units broke through one section of the Leningrad defense line, they were repelled by the Soviet defenders. The Soviet army has switched from defense to offense on the Leningrad front and is now attacking the German army with bayonets and cavalry.</p>
<h3>German Troops Concentrate on the Romanian-Bulgarian Border; Turkey Feels a Serious Threat; Rumor that Germany Demanded Passage Through Turkey, Resulting in an Ultimatum; A Large Number of British Aircraft Have Been Shipped from the Middle East to Turkey</h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Ankara, 26th. According to a National Broadcasting Company correspondent, an unspecified number of British-owned, American-made Tomahawk fighter planes were shipped here from the Middle East yesterday, and several hundred American planes will soon be given to the Turkish government by Britain for use. The United States recently delivered anti-aircraft guns to Turkey under the Lend-Lease Act. At the same time, according to a Reuters correspondent in Ankara, although Turkish officials vow goodwill between the two countries, Germany is currently waging a nervous war against Turkey unofficially. Pro-Nazi sources are spreading the news that German troops will arrive in Istanbul within a few weeks. Germans are now openly criticizing Turkish foreign policy, presumably because Turkey refuses to follow Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Finally, news has emerged from the capitals of both Bulgaria and Romania that Germany has issued an ultimatum to Turkey, demanding military passage. The purpose of this German intimidation campaign is undoubtedly to facilitate the work of German trade envoy Clodius, who is currently in talks with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 26th. A Turkish report broadcast by Moscow Radio foreshadows the German occupation of Bulgaria. It is said that foreign diplomatic circles stationed in Moscow believe that based on reports from Bulgaria, the internal political situation in Bulgaria is extremely serious. In the past few days, King Boris V of Bulgaria has met with German Ambassador Becker, and German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen, on his way from Berlin to Ankara, met with the Bulgarian King. News from Turkey also stated that people in Sofia said that senior Bulgarian military officers recently held a meeting, which was attended by German Navy Commander Raeder, German Army Commander Rogge, and Becker. The Germans demanded the removal of officers from the army who were disliked by the German government, whose names had been collected by German spies and handed over to the Bulgarian government to be dismissed from their posts. This shows that Bulgaria is "on the eve of a major event." There are now large-scale troop movements throughout Bulgaria. Several German marshals are now stationed on the Romanian-Bulgarian border. It is widely believed that Germany will soon complete its occupation of Bulgaria.</p>
<p>United Press Dispatch, Ankara, 26th. Diplomatic sources stated today that the Bulgarian cabinet, in a secret meeting, decided to request Germany to mediate on the demand that Bulgaria declare war on the Soviet Union, and to negotiate the task of Bulgaria taking over the occupation of areas in Europe.</p>
<h3>Germany Demands Vassal States Send One Million Troops; To Assist in the Winter Campaign on the Eastern Front; Rumor that Italy and Bulgaria Refuse on Pretexts</h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Ankara, 26th. According to reliable sources, Hitler has demanded that other Axis countries send a large number of reinforcements to the Eastern Front in the winter. The numbers are allocated as follows: (1) Italy 500,000 men, (2) Hungary 150,000 men, (3) Bulgaria 150,000 men, (4) Romania 100,000 men, (5) Slovakia 100,000 men. Italy, considering the need to send troops to Libya, is now making excuses to refuse Germany's request. Bulgaria is also rumored to be attempting to refuse, while the other countries have accepted.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 26th. According to a Geneva newspaper correspondent in Rome, new Italian troops are about to be transferred to the Eastern Front. It is likely that the Germans will still order the Italian troops to guard the occupied areas.</p>

<p>TASS Dispatch, Moscow, 26th. According to the German command on the 24th, 570 Soviet tanks were destroyed and 380,000 Red Army soldiers were captured in the Kiev region. The falsity of this rumor is obvious and beyond dispute. In reality, the battle in the Kiev region is still raging. The enemy indeed outnumbers us. The outcome of the battle is indeed unpredictable. Undoubtedly, the Germans do have the intention of capturing 380,000 Red Army soldiers, but they do not have the strength to do so.</p>
<h3>Soviet Navy Landings Assist in the Battle; Romanian Army's Attack on Odessa Collapses</h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 26th. Reports from Moscow state that the Soviet garrison in Odessa has once again defeated the 13th and 15th Romanian infantry divisions, and the situation has greatly improved. According to the Red Star newspaper, after the two Romanian divisions were previously repelled by the Soviet army, they gathered their remnants and attacked the Odessa defense line again. The Romanian commander apparently held great hopes for this. After fierce fighting all day, the Romanian army broke through the Soviet lines at the cost of hundreds of casualties. However, the Soviet army did not give up and tried to flank the Romanian army, cutting off its connection with the main force before it could expand the breakthrough point. The Romanian army was isolated. With the assistance of naval forces landing, the Soviet army launched a flanking attack on the other side of the Romanian army. The Romanian army could not withstand it, collapsed and fled. As a result, the Odessa defense line is becoming increasingly remote. A Soviet communiqué also stated that a squadron of aircraft from the Soviet Black Sea Fleet destroyed 11 enemy aircraft on the airfield.</p>
<p>TASS Dispatch, Odessa, 26th. The soldiers and civilians of Odessa, who have been fighting hard for more than a month, held a radio address as usual on the 24th amidst the sound of artillery and bombs. Red Army soldier Puskalov said, "The vicious enemy is attacking us with extremely large formations. Most of them have already dug their graves outside the city. We will never lay down our weapons until fascism is defeated. We are determined to avenge our compatriots who were brutally murdered."</p>

The production of tanks, from steel plates to wireless motors and periscopes, is uninterrupted. It is estimated that 65% of the female workers are engaged in the manufacture of various parts of tanks.</p>

<h3>US Senator Formally Proposes to Congress to Repeal the Neutrality Act; The US Promotes a Policy of Freedom of the Seas; The Act in Reality Only Has a Nominal Existence</h3>
<p>United Press Dispatch, Washington, 27th. Senator McKellar, a Democrat from Tennessee, has introduced a bill in the Senate to repeal the Neutrality Act. McKellar stated, "We were wrong to pass this act in the past. This act has not benefited us in any way. It has only worsened the bad situation. This act is contrary to our long-standing policy of freedom of the seas. For more than a hundred years, we have not hesitated to launch two wars to preserve this policy." The government has recently started a movement to repeal or amend the Neutrality Act, and this should be the first step in the legislative procedure. McKellar said that the Neutrality Act is enforced in the Atlantic but ignored in the Pacific. According to McKellar, it seems that the government does not regard the "Sino-Japanese conflict" as a war. He also said, "If we maintain this bill, we are in effect acknowledging Germany's slogan of controlling a part of the Atlantic."</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Washington, 26th. It is currently not clear whether Senator McKellar consulted with the Senate leadership before introducing the bill to repeal the Neutrality Act. According to what he said, although this Neutrality Act is listed in the statutes, the government does not pay attention to it. Therefore, it would be better to repeal it. Isolationist Republican Senator Taft said that the repeal of the Neutrality Act is tantamount to a declaration of war. At the same time, Republican Congressman Woodruff in the House of Representatives claimed that the President is now giving Congress the opportunity to agree to repeal the Neutrality Act. This act only has a nominal existence. The government does not want to implement it. All those in Congress and in Washington who are familiar with current affairs know that the President has already destroyed this Neutrality Act in spirit. Judging from the President's past actions, there is no difference to the President whether Congress repeals or amends this act, because the President himself has in effect repealed or amended the regulations whenever he deems it necessary, in order to suit his needs. The American people should know that when the President issued an order to the US Navy during his worldwide broadcast to shoot down German and Italian submarines and aircraft, he had already dealt a fatal blow to the Neutrality Act. From now on, although the Neutrality Act exists in name, it has already perished.</p>
<h3>Australia's First Minister Arrives in China to Take Office; Delivers a Speech in Rangoon</h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Rangoon, 26th. Australia's first minister to China, Eggleston, on his way to Chongqing to take office, told a Reuters reporter in Rangoon that Australia attaches great importance to this war. Even if the government changes, it will not change its commitment to fighting seriously. For a country of seven million people, Australia has already made a significant contribution to this war. Australia is extremely impressed by China's heroic resistance and admires the great leader of the Chinese people. The Australian minister continued, saying that the British Empire's diplomacy is consistent, and that although Australia bears full responsibility for protecting its interests in the Pacific, it recognizes that this responsibility must be exercised under a system of mutual cooperation between British representatives. Therefore, he hopes to cooperate fully with the British Ambassador in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy of Aligning with the Axis Has Absolutely Not Changed; Japanese Spokesperson Expresses This Bluntly; Declares that the Door to Japanese-American Reconciliation Is Closed; A Large-Scale Celebration Will Be Held Today to Commemorate the Anniversary of the Treaty</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 26th. A Japanese government spokesperson told foreign reporters that the Japanese side believes that the door to Japanese-American reconciliation is closed. If the Japanese government were to reconcile with the United States, it would not be able to maintain its position and would be in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>United Press Dispatch, Tokyo, 26th. Foreign Minister Toyoda will hold a special luncheon tomorrow to host the ambassadors and military attachés of the Axis countries to celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>United Press Dispatch, Tokyo, 26th. The Kokumin Shimbun quoted Colonel Mabuchi, a spokesman for the Japanese military, as saying today that Japan will not deviate from the Tripartite Alliance. The Kokumin Shimbun said that Colonel Mabuchi said at a discussion meeting that some Japanese people, when discussing Japanese-American relations, expect that Japan's foreign policy will deviate from the Tripartite Pact, but they are greatly mistaken. I believe that Japan's moral values ​​will never allow it to do so. In fact, even if Japan changes its policy, it cannot have any benefit. The circumstances when the Tripartite Alliance was signed have not changed. Therefore, the enthusiasm that the Japanese people had when they welcomed the signing of the Tripartite Pact a year ago should not have changed either. Also, before attending the same discussion meeting, retired Admiral Takahashi, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, said that he could not comment on Japanese diplomatic relations, but when the Tripartite Alliance was signed, the Emperor issued an edict, and the China Incident has also clarified who are Japan's allies or enemies. Therefore, Japan's actions should clearly be based on strengthening the Axis alliance.</p>
<p>United Press Dispatch, Tokyo, 26th. Ito, Director of the Planning Board of the Cabinet, stated today that he wants to particularly emphasize that "no matter what changes occur in the international situation in the future, no matter what difficulties we encounter, the spirit of the Tripartite Pact is the main theme of our diplomacy, and the fact that it will never be influenced by the divisive activities of a third country will never change." Ito said in a nationwide broadcast to Japan on the first anniversary of Japan's alignment with the Tripartite Pact: "This treaty is different from previous military alliances. It is not intended to gain the benefits of war, but to prevent the spread of war and seek happiness for mankind. Therefore, I believe that we should, in accordance with the spirit of the Tripartite Pact, use all possible peaceful methods with great determination to establish a 'New Order.' If any third country interferes, we will resolutely reject it."</p>
<h3>Japan Prepares to Send Ships to the United States; To Transport Overseas Chinese Back to China; Both Sides Are in Negotiations</h3>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Tokyo, 26th. War situation spokesperson Ishii told reporters this morning that Japan is currently negotiating with the United States about sending a ship to the United States to transport Japanese expatriates back, and said that this negotiation is not the result of any new development in US-Japanese relations.

<p>Reuters Dispatch, Tokyo, 26th. A Japanese official spokesman said today that the Japanese government is currently considering resuming navigation across the Pacific to Hawaii, but the general shipping bureau has no new developments.</p>

<h3>Thailand Maintains Neutrality, Resolves to Resist Aggression, Hopes for Material Assistance from Britain and the United States, Japanese Conspiracy Exposed, Over One Hundred Arrested</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 26th – A responsible critic who has traveled in Thailand for many years and often had the opportunity to meet with high-ranking Thai officials, arrived here this week and stated that Thailand now hopes to receive direct assistance in the form of raw material supplies from Britain and the United States, but has not yet made a direct request. However, a few months ago, it indirectly expressed this intention to the British Minister in Bangkok. At that time, Britain believed it needed the raw materials it could obtain for itself and could not transfer them to others. The Thai government's ideological orientation will never be mistaken. British expatriates and Thais still hope that Britain will make a gesture and provide assistance with a small number of new aircraft to create an air force. Thailand is determined to strictly maintain neutrality and resist Japanese aggression. The strengthening of military power in Malaya is welcomed by Thailand, as it knows that this move can curb Japan's aggressive plans and reduce the possibility of Thailand being forced to join the Far East war. Thailand now plans to deploy more troops to increase its strength in the south. Large-scale military exercises may soon be conducted within Thailand. Thais are now paying close attention to the entry of Japanese people. In the past three weeks, more than 150 Japanese have been arrested, and some military supplies have been seized. Thailand is unwilling to be in the clutches of the Japanese.</p>
<p>British Minister to Thailand Arrives in Singapore</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 26th – British Minister to Thailand, Mr. Crosbie, recently arrived here from Rangoon to discuss matters with Mr. Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's special envoy to the Far East, and will also meet with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr.</p>

<h3>The Headquarters of the Democratic Front</h3>
<p>Washington, D.C., the wartime capital of the United States, has finally realized the ideals of its original designers. This small city on the banks of the Potomac River is growing rapidly. Major L'Enfant, the famous French architect's vision of a "Federal Capital," has finally been realized. Washington, D.C., is no longer just "a memorial hall of nostalgic fantasies" as described by the British novelist Dickens; its wide streets, starting from nowhere, lead to nowhere. It has become the wartime capital of the Western Hemisphere, a bustling metropolis, the nightmare of the Axis, the hope of the democratic front, and even Dickens's London looks up to it.</p>
<p>From the top of the Washington Monument, one can overlook the panoramic view of the metropolis in the faint morning light. The patterned avenues stretch out towards the clear blue waters in the reflection of the rising sun. Looking down from above, it is like an architect's dream, a model city of a world expo created by electrical switches, an object of study of light, shadow, and power, a strange mixture of straight, modern boulevards and classical Greek and Roman columned buildings.</p>
<p>Every morning at seven o'clock, the government agencies begin to operate. Government officials begin to gather in the city. Countless cars, which look very small and exquisite from above, roll down from the Virginia mountains, speed across the bridges over the Potomac River, circle around the Capitol Building on Jenkins Hill, and finally stop, one by one, like mechanized beetles lined up along every street in the city center. This is the daily invasion of the Potomac River by new forces—this army has changed the entire atmosphere and dynamics of the nation's capital.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the British historian Sir James Bryce, referring to the United States after the Civil War, said that the United States was "the only country in the world without a capital." At that time, Washington, D.C., was just a small city with a population of 147,293. By the twentieth century, it had increased to 278,718, and by the end of the First World War, it had increased to 437,571. When President Roosevelt came to power in 1933, the capital's population was 488,000. Now, due to the concentration of government personnel and the prosperity of the defense industry, it has increased to more than 700,000, and "Greater Washington" will soon have a population of one million.</p>
<p>This dramatic change is almost entirely due to the newly arrived government employees and their families. In June 1933, there were only 65,437 government employees in the capital; now there are more than 170,000, which is 52,000 more than the highest record during the First World War. In the past year alone, the government has added 40,000 new employees, and the city's population has increased by about 75,000.</p>
<p>The high-speed changes in the capital have resulted in a hundred difficulties. Prosperity has spread to all aspects of society; it has affected the cost of living, created various new social problems, changed the working hours and living conditions of most people, expanded the social life and nightlife of the metropolis, and the entire future problem of Washington, D.C., is once again displayed in front of us.</p>
<p>First, in terms of social changes, let's start with the most common aspect. Besides the war and President Roosevelt, the housing problem has become the main topic of conversation. Last year, about 80 percent of the 40,000 government employees paid less than $38 a week for rent, and they were willing to pay $40 a month to find housing. The need for housing is so urgent that by January of this year, all the houses in the city had been rented out. According to a report by the Congressional Committee, only 605 of the 1,972 government employee families seeking housing were able to find it.</p>
<p>The lack of apartments is also the same. In August of last year, one month after the real boom began, 7.94 percent of the apartment houses in the city were vacant. By September 1, the vacancy rate had dropped to 5.99 percent, and by March 1 of this year, it had decreased to 1 to 1.51 percent. By Easter of this year, all the apartments were full.</p>
<p>The housing problem has also led to other problems. With the demand for houses exceeding the supply, rents have naturally soared. As rents rise, those families who are used to living in houses that cost $30 a month, although not spacious, are still decent, are gradually forced to move to more humble areas. Many families have to sublet. The lowest-income class often has as many as eight families living together, with twenty-four people sharing one bathroom in an eight-room house. This situation is a problem for the health bureau, and the Congressional Committee has now begun an investigation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the authorities are also concerned about the accommodation problem of the tens of thousands of women who have come to Beijing from all over the country since the second half of last year. At the beginning of this year, the government added more than 12,000 female typists and stenographers. It has long been impossible to have a private room in a private house. Young women are now renting a room together in groups of two or three in the slums, and the Civil Service Commission is still recruiting tens of thousands of typists and stenographers from all over the country (to be continued).

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Mixed Yarn Swept Clean, Double Horse Factory Singles Reach New High, Off-Exchange Price of 1,800 Yuan, Futures Rise Also Suddenly Intensifies</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to trend upward, and the rise gradually intensifies. This is due to the continued purchases of 20-count Double Horse and coarse yarns from the Nanyang region. As a result, the price of mixed yarn has soared, leading to a shortage of spot goods. Therefore, there is the pain of not being able to buy it. The feeling of a shortage of spot goods is also a reason. Secondly, with the price increase, the holders of the goods feel more stable and become willing to hold on tightly. In the current situation, the market and futures reinforce each other. It is found that mixed yarn is being urgently drawn for immediate delivery. The price of each yarn has continued to rise by 30 to 40 yuan compared with the previous day. As a result, people's hearts have been lifted, and the market has turned long. However, there are still many people shorting. The high price of 20-count Double Horse is 1,781 yuan, and the low price is 1,765 yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment continued to rise, opening at 1,785 yuan. Subsequently, the prices of all yarns and cloths in the exchange rose, and then rose to 1,792 yuan. On the way, those with profits sold out, and it loosened to 1,780 yuan. The closing price recovered to 1,787 yuan. Currently, if there is no unexpected blow to the yarn market, the price of mixed yarn may rise to the level outside of 1,800 yuan. After the close, the off-exchange price reached 1,800 yuan, and then fell slightly to 1,790 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Double Horse was peaceful, but it seemed to be firm in the midst of softness. The opening price was 1,765 yuan. After some profit-taking, it loosened to 1,767 or 1,768 yuan. After a slight fluctuation, it was heard that the price in the exchange was rising, and the demand from Guangbang and Nanyang continued to come. The price of mixed yarn rose step by step, and people's hearts were excited. The industry unanimously pulled in, and the market rose from 1,772 or 1,773 yuan to 1,781 yuan at the close. It is found that the statistics of transactions in half a day were 11,340 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 680 Nanyang 660</p>
<p>Same industry 11,340</p>
<p>The futures market situation of Jin Double Horse followed the firm trend of the previous day, and the rise suddenly intensified. Although American cotton was still soft, the factory single trend was surprisingly strong, which caused the shake of short positions. Although there was no special development in the overall situation, the exchange suddenly soared, which further promoted the buying enthusiasm of buyers to pull up spot goods. Therefore, the factory single was strongly driven up, and the new high of 1,792 yuan was once reached. The futures yarn was supported by active trading, new long positions and short covering, and surged up. For a time, the demand on the trading floor exceeded the supply, and the market atmosphere was unusually firm. The opening price for October was 1,668 yuan, a good price of 1.5 yuan. The price for November was 1,680 yuan, also a good price of 1 yuan. The price for December was 1,675 yuan, a good price of 2 yuan at the opening. After entering, it was once slightly tired, but then with the added progress of the factory single, it rose again. The demand in the market was the most active in recent days. It is allowed that the afternoon fluctuation was even greater, and the rise was high. Although the closing price slightly returned, the foot on the ground because of the spot goods pull fixed, there may still be a possible legacy increase. However, new long positions should be cautious. As a result, the October period closed at 1,675 yuan, up 8.5 yuan, the November period was 1,686.5 yuan, also up 7.5 yuan, and the December period was 1,735 yuan, up as much as 11 yuan. The price table is listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Indian Cotton Arrive, Coarse Lint Still Sells Well</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is quite firm, and the price follows the yarn market upwards. Coarse lint cotton is still selling well. Holders are mostly holding on tightly and unwilling to sell. There are few peddlers on the market, and the demand is strong. This is the inevitable phenomenon of the price rising.</p>
<p>A large amount of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Poyang Wheel arrived the day before yesterday, carrying 3,331 pieces of Indian cotton from Hong Kong. Also, the Anshun Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,942 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong. The above cotton was all transported from Mumbai and Kolkata to Hong Kong, and then transshipped to Shanghai.</p>

Cash suddenly soared, and the price actually flew out of the two levels of 9,100 and 9,200 yuan. This was entirely due to the fact that Qianduiye fiercely entered 580 taels, Mingfeng entered 350 taels, and Xianghe entered more than 200 taels, which was caused by the demand for chips exceeding the supply. People's hearts turned upwards. From the beginning of the morning, Xianghe first entered 20 taels, Dafeng and Fang Jiuxia 10 taels each, and the price had risen to 9,100 taels, which was 30 yuan higher than the opening price.

<h3>Food: Sensation in the Rice Market, Unable to Do Anything</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Yangmi early market still bore the weak trend of the previous day, and continued to show a soft color. Straight until the middle market, the Yinwai two stack small squeezes all fell open at one hundred and nine yuan, causing large households of internal and external customers to absorb at cheap prices. The inland Hangzhe gangs once again started to purchase broken tips, and the local stores and other actual sales also tracked and added high-grade goods. Moreover, because the international situation is not easy to clarify, the speculators came to stir up trouble. The overall situation began to recover from fatigue. At that time, the selling households' shouts turned upward, and each price returned to one or two yuan, but still had two fillings. Actual sales inevitably feared that once the price was mentioned, they would hold back and retreat first, and the momentary skin ball business was restrained. So the later market was only half flat. As a result, the closing market situation, except for the small squeezes, seemed to see a bit more than half a yuan due to the psychological effect. The opening of Yin Stack goods was 112 yuan, 111.5 yuan. The outer stacks were 111.5 yuan, 111 yuan, and the broken tips of high goods were opened at 86.5 yuan. Other goods still did not have much change, which can be called a set. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is still as high as 125 yuan, determined to 122.5 yuan, No. 2 114 yuan cattle, 114 yuan, Central Pass 112 yuan, determined to 110 yuan, No. 2 Siam 110 yuan, Central Pass 108 yuan, and the original white Min party in Central Pass, and because the road out is unique, it is still worth close to yuan compared to before, only leisurely 1134 yuan. Yinghua Si is also quite prosperous, small squeeze spot goods, determined 129 yuan to 129.5 yuan, high 137.45 yuan, transaction 6700 tons, spot rice more than 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arriving in Shanghai is incessant. Taikoo Company's Poyang Wheel arrived the day before yesterday. In addition to a large number of cotton flowers shipped from Hong Kong, there are also 1683 bags of foreign rice stopping at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Hualun Foreign Company's Deda Wheel, directly shipped more than 50,000 bags of foreign rice from Rangoon to the public warehouse of the Bureau of Works. It is heard that it can arrive this morning.</p>
<p>The thick and thin Japonica rice market, in the middle of the foreign rice market, also entered a flat road because the supply and demand were similar. Therefore, the prices of the new and broken Japonica rice all followed the original disk, and there was no noise. Continuing to open Nangang early broken 147 yuan, followed by 145 yuan, special 148 yuan, overnight next 140 yuan. Pudong new Japonica 152 yuan, 151.5 yuan. Thick broken is still lacking goods to the market.</p>
<p>The source of glutinous rice has been cut off for a long time, and the market goods are scarce. Therefore, although the sales market is not smooth, there are still some sporadic stomachs, but the market can still be copied, and there is no glory. The opening of Hong Kong special yuan 1356 yuan, the big market 1334 yuan, the middle 131 yuan, the glutinous rice especially 120 yuan, and the big market 1189 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Customer Active, Cold Brand Mixed Flour Rises by Yuan Xu</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign flour actual sales, although only sporadic embellishments, and the two poor customers, the market father saw prosperity, and the foreign gangs outside the city collected and replenished, and there were also psychological transactions, and the re-export gang such as Tianjin and other customers continued to inquire in the market. The skin ball transaction took the opportunity to be lively, and floating scattered actual consumption also took the opportunity to add to it. Therefore, not only standard brands such as the Fortress Golden Dragon and various flours are selling well, but also cold brand mixed flours are quite prosperous. Once the cold brand is favored by the customers, the rising trend is even more profitable. The mixed brand has risen by eight corners to one yuan, and the hot brand has risen by five to seven corners. The total transaction inside and outside the day is no less than 50,000 bags. The sale opened the Fortress at 33.95 yuan to 34.45 yuan at the end of the market, Jinlong Xizhan at 32 yuan to 32.5 yuan, Dongzhan at 32.5 yuan to 32.85 yuan, Banana at 33.85 yuan to 34.25 yuan, Five Swallow at 33.78 yuan, Motorboat at 34.3 yuan, Golden at 33 yuan, Green Leopard at 33.6 yuan to .9 yuan, Airplane at 30.095 yuan, and wheat bran is in short supply.

<h3>Ji Juemi, Chief Accountant of Hardoon Foreign Firm, Nearly Kidnapped</h3>
<p>At 9:45 last night, five or six kidnappers with three pistols and one iron rod in car No. 2189 went to No. 26 (119) Seymour Road to kidnap an elderly man. At that time, they first seized the man's bodyguard's pistol and pushed the man into the car. Just as the detectives arrived, the man shouted for help. The kidnappers, fearing something was wrong, abandoned the man and drove away in the car. As a result, the man was not kidnapped. Afterwards, the police station sent a large number of detectives to investigate. It is rumored that the man who escaped the kidnapping was Ji Juemi of Hardoon Foreign Firm.</p>
<h3>Notre Dame Road – Man Arrested – Already Transported to Hongkou</h3>
<p>At 6 PM the day before yesterday, six plainclothes Japanese officers in car number 5871 with a black license plate drove directly to the French Municipal Police Station in Zikawei. They requested the dispatch of additional personnel to assist in arresting a Chinese man at a certain house near the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Avenue Notre Dame. The police station immediately sent both Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, but they found nothing. It was reported that they thoroughly searched the house for an hour, but to no avail. Yesterday morning around 10 AM, Japanese officers, together with detectives from the French police, went there again and arrested a Chinese man in his thirties inside a certain house. It is said that the man was very large, wearing a long grey flannel gown. The detectives took him to the police station. Around 2 PM, two Japanese men arrived in a military police vehicle (No. 187), took the man from the police station, put him in the car, and drove him to Hongkou. The man's name and address are being kept secret by the police authorities and will not be announced.</p>

<h3>Soaring Prices of Imported Goods in Shanghai – Stabilization Fund Should Stop This Quickly</h3>
<p>Today's edition of the *Millard's Review* contains an essay by the renowned maritime economist Ahn Han-neng (i.e., Arnhold), urging the Exchange Stabilization Fund to curb the evil trend of import merchants monopolizing and hoarding goods for speculation. A translated summary of the main points is as follows: "Obtaining cheap foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund must meet certain conditions. Those who obtain foreign exchange must not participate in black market transactions, must settle export bills at the stabilized exchange rate, and must prevent the exchange provided by the Stabilization Fund, or goods imported with it, from falling into the hands of totalitarian countries or uncooperative parties. But can all these stipulations be fully and reasonably implemented as required by the Stabilization Fund?"</p>
<p>Exploiting Loopholes – Implementing Monopoly</p>
<p>Clearly, import merchants in Shanghai who seek to settle foreign exchange with the Stabilization Fund have a great advantage over other importers. In many ways, only they can import the goods they deal in, creating some small monopolists. Local merchants in Shanghai are tempted by this situation and are increasingly exploiting their newly acquired semi-monopoly status to reap profits. Human nature being what it is, it is futile to expect them not to take advantage of this new opportunity to gain unexpected profits. The temptation to exploit temporary loopholes in the Stabilization Fund's policy is extremely strong, so the Stabilization Fund must prevent the monopolization and manipulation of goods imported with the foreign exchange it provides.</p>
<p>Import Merchants – Unprecedented Profits</p>
<p>Since Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds two months ago, the prices of virtually all imported goods have soared and continue to rise. This price increase far exceeds the increases in prices from foreign manufacturers, shipping costs, and exchange rates. Importers ignore the reduction in war risk insurance rates on Pacific shipping routes and continue to clamor incessantly, using high shipping costs as an excuse to frequently raise prices, but in reality, they are intentionally manipulating prices and hoarding goods for speculation. Furthermore, the implementation of the Stabilization Fund's exchange settlement policy has led to a reduction in imports, while market demand is greater than before, making price increases inevitable. Importers of approved goods are reaping unprecedented profits, resulting in large increases in retail prices. This development is undesirable.</p>
<p>Resolutely Crack Down – Attack Hoarding</p>
<p>The Stabilization Fund has very good reason to establish the following two principles to limit the supply of foreign exchange needed by the Shanghai market: (1) The monopolization and hoarding of goods imported with Stabilization Fund exchange is not allowed. These goods must be sold at reasonable profits for legitimate merchants, without excessive gains. New goods must be priced according to the exchange rate stipulated by the Stabilization Fund, and local inventory must be valued and sold at the new price. (2) The hoarding of goods imported with Stabilization Fund exchange is not allowed. They must be sold when the market needs them. If demand exceeds supply, importers must use a rationing method to supply actual consumer needs of buyers, not their storage capacity. Goods should be rationed and those who hoard goods should be rejected outright. Although fourteen banks are already considering this matter, it is hoped that the Stabilization Fund itself can take decisive action. Although this principle has already been applied to the import of rice by the Shanghai Municipal Council, it should also be applied to all other goods settled with foreign exchange."</p>
<h3>Three-Person Oil Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Artists Zhu Qizhan, Zhou Bichu, Qian Ding, and others have been diligent and tireless in their artistic pursuits. Having achieved some success in their works, they have agreed to gather 150 oil paintings and display them at the painting hall of the Great World Department Store. It is said that these works not only demonstrate meticulous construction but also feature changes in style, which will surely arouse the interest of viewers. The exhibition will be held from September 29th (starting next Monday) to October 5th.</p>
<p>Ms. Gu Fei's Landscape Painting and Calligraphy</p>
<p>The artwork shown is Ms. Gu Fei's imitation of Huang Heshan Qiao’s style. It is profound, natural, and deeply rooted in the traditions of the Yuan Dynasty, truly a masterpiece of the art world.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller Pushes Passenger to Death – Sentenced to Life Imprisonment – Perjury Investigation Continues – Incitement to Perjury Also Detained</h3>
<p>The practice of ticket sellers embezzling fares on the city's streetcars has been prevalent for a long time. Although the streetcar company has increased ticket inspections and implemented other measures, it has not yet been able to effectively curb this practice. On the 13th of this month, a tragic incident occurred in which a ticket seller pushed a passenger to death because he was unsuccessful in embezzling the fare.</p>
<p>Pushed, Fell, and Died</p>
<p>It is reported that Xiang Dongchuan was riding a Route 20 trolleybus on that day. Because the ticket seller, Wang Wanxiang, No. 358, a native of Haimen, did not give him a ticket after receiving the fare, Xiang Dongchuan protested without success. The ticket seller became angry out of shame and pushed Xiang Dongchuan off the bus at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road, causing him to fall and die. The police arrested Wang Wanxiang and sent him to the First Special Court. Jiang Jing, a student at St. John's University, motivated by justice and unafraid of the powerful, testified in court.</p>
<p>Concocted Perjury</p>
<p>However, the defendant colluded with Yan Defa, a rogue who rented a room from Jiang Jing, to give false testimony in court that violated conscience and morality. The lawyer representing the Shanghai Municipal Council, Zhang Tianyin, and the presiding judge, Shi Meiyu, discovered the fraud and detained him, turning him over to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Prosecutor Wu Qihua ordered his detention, pending completion of the investigation, and prosecution according to law.</p>
<p>Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>As for Wang Wanxiang, the police initially prosecuted him for murder. Later, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer, requested that the charge be changed to causing death by injury and that he be sentenced to the highest penalty under that article, namely life imprisonment, to deter future offenders. Xiang Dongchuan's family also appointed lawyers Jiang Bao and Pingfan to file a civil suit. The trial was concluded after hearing evidence and was awaiting judgment. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for sentencing. Judge Shi Meiyu took the bench in the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict: Wang Wanxiang caused the death of a person by injury and is sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of public rights for life. The civil suit is transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.</p>
<p>Perjury</p>
<p>Regarding Yan Yingfa's perjury, Prosecutor Wu Qihua reopened the second investigation yesterday afternoon. Jiang Jing's mother, the original witness, was also summoned to court. According to her testimony, Yan had told her that the deceased was already dead, so why pursue the matter? There were three thousand ticket sellers in the streetcar company, and if they could help the living (referring to Wang Wanxiang), each of the three thousand ticket sellers could contribute one yuan, which would amount to three thousand yuan. If each person contributed ten yuan, it would amount to thirty thousand yuan. Prosecutor Wu also summoned Mi Shilin, a ticket seller from Zhenjiang, No. 241, to testify.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation</p>
<p>As a result of the investigation, it was learned that Yan's false statement in court was incited by Mi and his colleagues. Therefore, Mi was also ordered to be detained, pending a joint investigation with Yan Defa to clarify the facts before prosecution. It is reported that Mi was not the only one who incited the perjury; there were other ticket sellers involved. Therefore, the court is conducting a rigorous investigation to warn those who disregard human life and play with the law.</p>
<h3>Hope and Encouragement (3) – Written After the Industry and Commerce Group Scholarship – Written by Applicant No. 40</h3>
<p>Encouragement</p>
<p>The Shen Bao often says, "It is most joyful to do good." Thus, all those who contribute funds seek peace of mind and do not haggle over personal merits. We, who receive their assistance, should not feel ashamed. On the contrary, the sympathy and assistance we receive due to our diligence demonstrates that our hard work has not been in vain. Thus, receiving assistance today is a very honorable thing, and it is different from that of ordinary children. Therefore, all fellow recipients should respect themselves, love themselves, always work hard, always strive, and always be able to receive the sympathy of society. This is the first thing that must be recognized.</p>
<p>In today's era, our position and the earnest expectations of the donors cannot tolerate even a moment of laziness. We must strive upwards with all our might, taking two steps at a time. This is the second thing that must be recognized.</p>
<p>Knowledge is not a private tool. Today, we accept the past experiences of our predecessors, and tomorrow, we must create another experience from our current life experiences and practical matters, to serve as a foundation for those who come after us. This is the true responsibility of learning. The Shen Bao editorial on August 21st said, "Today we receive from society, and tomorrow we must repay society a hundredfold." This is an unwavering truth, and it is the most important meaning of helping ourselves and helping others. This is the third thing we must recognize.</p>
<p>Our primary effort and the most direct way to repay kindness is that now that we have received the sympathy of others and the preferential treatment of various managers, we should be satisfied, respect our work, enjoy our work, view our occupation as a career, devote ourselves fully, not be lazy, and not be weary of our work. We should cherish our firms and companies as we cherish our own families. Since the authorities are so generous to us, how can we not repay them with sincerity? This is the fourth thing to recognize.</p>
<p>The state of the world and people's hearts are all reflected in the character of each individual. No matter how learned a person is, if they lack upright character and a proper attitude towards life, they cannot be called a complete person. Therefore, we must be extremely serious about our personal lives in our work and in our private lives, not indulging in extravagance, and not entering luxurious places. Only in this way can we have a good character, which we can then extend to others, gain respect, serve as a model for society, and plant a beautiful seed for the future of the new China. This is the fifth thing to recognize.</p>
<p>"Repaying kindness" is actually secondary, while "being a person" is paramount. If we can love ourselves, have a simple character, pure aspirations, passionately love our country, and serve society faithfully, that is also "repaying kindness." Therefore, rather than rushing to "repay kindness," we recipients should adhere to our positions and strive to "be a person." We must strive to be human, so that we will not be ashamed to be an elder brother to those who come after us, and so that we can also realize the initial intentions of the Shen Bao to serve society and the donors to establish people.</p>
<p>Fellow recipients! Today, the world is engulfed in flames of war. Justice and righteousness await the birth of a new era to nurture their growth. The well-being of humanity awaits the creation of a youthful generation. And the brilliant future of our nation awaits our perseverance and joint struggle. Dear fellow students! Life is short, and responsibility is great. At the beginning of this semester, I would like to encourage and exhort you! (Completed late at night on September 13th, 1941)</p>

<p>According to a gentleman who recently returned from abroad and works in international youth academic circles, since the outbreak of the European War, there has been a very obvious change in the thinking of young intellectuals in various countries. They are particularly concerned about the following three questions:</p>
<p>First, in this turbulent world, what is the position of force? Is might going to replace right? Is violence supreme?</p>
<p>Second, in this society where the gap between rich and poor is as wide as the heavens, is it necessary to adjust the economic structure? How should it be adjusted?</p>
<p>Third, the League of Nations can be said to have died in its bed. There is no international arbitration body in the world. After the end of this war, will countries organize similar groups again? What form should be used to organize it in order to avoid future wars?</p>
<p>The future world belongs to this generation of young people. It is worth celebrating that young intellectuals in various countries have such concepts and thoughts. Judging from the questions that young people are thinking about, we dare to assert that we will have a better and more rational world.</p>

<h3>Wartime British Schoolchildren</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xinliang</p>
<p>Of the five million schoolchildren in Britain, more than one million live in London. Only more than 112,000 schoolchildren have been evacuated from London so far, of which 90,000 are currently unable to receive any form of education.</p>
<p>In London today, so-called "compulsory education" no longer exists. Before the war, the original supervisors' duty was to visit various families to see if there were children who had reached the age of admission, and urge parents to send them to school as soon as possible, otherwise they would be subject to fines and imprisonment; but now this good system has been completely suspended.</p>
<p>First, school inspectors are no longer working in order to help people evacuate. Second, the whereabouts of most of the evacuated children cannot be ascertained. They may have gone to another county or village, they may have entered other schools, and as a result, even if they want to force the children to attend school, they have no way to force them. Mothers knew this, so they didn't send their children to school.</p>
<p>Everyone may say that after the number of students is reduced, the discipline can be more thorough, but this is not entirely true. Since the number of students can be reduced, the number of teachers will naturally be reduced as well. In fact, many male and female teachers have been conscripted by the local government to perform various wartime services. One such service is taking care of homeless children in air-raid shelters. They said: "Yes, we know that our responsibility was to teach, but at present, those children cannot attend normally, and even if they come, the students are all listless and cannot study well; when they are awake, their minds are still full of the fear of bombing and the threat of guns. So, it is more meaningful for us to do this kind of rescue work."</p>
<p>Some people are also saying: Why not teach children in air-raid shelters? Regarding this point, there are many difficulties. The equipment is incomplete, there are no tables, no books, no ink, and the lighting is poor, making reading difficult. Studying hard in this situation will only cause physical and mental damage to the children. What's more, after several evacuations, the students are scattered, and matters such as class division are difficult to handle; teaching children of different levels and ages together feels unsatisfactory everywhere.</p>
<p>The impact of war on a country first affects education. Under the current unreasonable and barbaric attacks, the enemy's planes do not care about culture or anything else, they bomb arbitrarily, and finally make the children suffer the pain of losing their schooling after being displaced. However, the British authorities, recognizing the importance of education in wartime, are making every effort to restore the "compulsory education" system, striving to make children evacuate with "teachers", and turning rural houses into temporary wartime schoolhouses in order to continue classes, so that the children's studies will not be neglected.</p>
<p>Although this will cost a considerable amount of money, the total budget is only the consumption of one day of war—50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Historical Tales</p>
<h3>The Falcon and the Duck</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>(New Interpretation of Master Ai, Part 5)</p>
<p>Zhao Wang had a famous general named Zhao She, who was enfeoffed as Lord Ma Fu because of his many achievements. Lord Ma Fu's prestige filled the entire Zhao Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lord Ma Fu had a precious son named Zhao Kuo, who, relying on his father, also spread his fame, but in fact, he had no ability at all.</p>
<p>At this time, the State of Qin came to attack Zhao. Zhao Wang believed in genetics, thinking that if there was his father Zhao She, there must be his son Zhao Kuo, so he promoted Zhao Kuo to commander-in-chief and ordered him to resist Qin.</p>
<p>"Son, I am grateful for the King's promotion. You must do your best this time." Lord Ma Fu instructed before parting.</p>
<p>"Father, please rest assured, your son will definitely return in triumph!" Zhao Kuo said proudly.</p>
<p>Saying is useless, you have to look at real ability. Zhao Kuo confronted the Qin general Lord Wu'an, but how could he be a match? Zhao Kuo was captured alive, and 400,000 Zhao soldiers were sent to their deaths. The State of Zhao was almost beyond salvation because of this.</p>
<p>When Master Ai heard about this, he made a round of remarks.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a person wanted to hunt and wanted to buy a falcon, but he didn't know how to identify one, so he bought a duck back. He took that fake falcon to hunt. A rabbit came from afar, and he threw it into the air, but it fell down. He threw it again and it fell again. It painfully crawled up and said in human language:</p>
<p>"Sir, I am a duck, you can kill me and eat me, why do you keep throwing me?"</p>
<p>"I thought you were a falcon that could hunt rabbits!"</p>
<p>The duck raised its palm and smiled, saying, "Look at my webbed feet, how can I catch rabbits?"</p>
<p>There are many things in the world that could have been successful, but because of the improper use of people, they cause great harm later. To put politics on the right track, you must first look at the abilities of the people who are in charge of politics.</p>
<h3>I'm Even More Anxious</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>After the micro-article solicitation announcement in Free Talk was published, the editor was buried in piles of submissions every day. Sometimes hundreds of manuscripts came in one day; even after the deadline of the 20th, they continued to arrive, which shows the ardent love of the readers.</p>
<p>I have not yet finished reviewing the manuscripts, but some readers have already written to ask why the solicitation was not published earlier, and said that this made them "too anxious". My answer is: "I am even more anxious than anyone else." I hope readers will understand my painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>We originally planned to publish the usable micro-articles at any time, but because there were too many submissions, for the sake of fairness, we can only wait until all of them have been read before publishing them in installments in Free Talk, starting from the national calendar date of 1941. This can be considered a general reply, and is hereby declared.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Battery-Powered Mopeds</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>Since Germany swept across the European continent and made large-scale adventures, there has been a shortage of daily necessities in the country. Therefore, the invention of substitutes has sprung up like mushrooms. Recently, due to the fact that gasoline is a necessary fuel for mechanized troops, the supply is far from meeting the demand, and the government has ordered it to be controlled. Therefore, the German people have had whimsical ideas and used the power of dry batteries to drive mopeds. The person in the picture is using two dry batteries, and their power is sufficient for 63 hours of driving, which is also a precious story in wartime.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Qingou</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Unexpected Storm</p>
<p>What he heard made sense, but Manager Meng kept pestering him, asking him to think about how many acquaintances he had in Zhangshucun and the surrounding areas, and which one had a feud with Lin Sheng; but Begonia had already received Yu Kun's instructions, so of course he tried his best to deny it, and always said that he couldn't remember.</p>
<p>"I think this is the way to go!" After a long stalemate, Zhang Laoliu came out to offer a compromise. "Our Third Master might as well give Manager Meng some more thought to see if there is a way to go; on the one hand, Manager Meng can also quickly send people to look around, or simply go to the North River Town Police Station to report the case. As long as everyone works together, the young shopkeeper will be found sooner or later."</p>
<p>Meng's family also felt that there was no other way but to thank them and quickly retreat.</p>
<p>"Things are really coincidental. Our Miss Mei Bao hasn't returned yet, but you have lost another young shopkeeper. What kind of world is this?" Zhang Laoliu couldn't help but say playfully as he sent them to the door.</p>
<p>Manager Meng had a disease in his heart, and he couldn't help but suddenly tremble when he heard this.</p>
<p>"Oh! This matter is a bit strange!" He thought secretly as he walked down the street.</p>
<p>Later, when he went to the North River Town Police Sub-bureau to report the case, he also told the police chief Li what he was thinking. (222)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Wu Suqiu's Marriage Change Record (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>(Beiping Aviation News) While the Shanghai film stars' marriage changes are causing a stir, the ancient capital of Beiping is not to be outdone. The amorous scandals of many popular Kun actors are also spreading throughout the nine cities. The following is a romantic case of the Kun actor Wu Suqiu, who just became popular in Shanghai by spinning cotton.</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu was a student at the Beiping Opera School. Her name at school was Wu Yunyu. In addition to her beautiful appearance, her singing and acting skills were poor. Therefore, she could only play the role of the Eighth and Ninth Sisters in "Si Lang Visits His Mother". In short, she was a side character. However, because of her pretty face, she inevitably hooked up with various people. At that time, several male classmates were on good terms with her. Wang Helin, who sang old male roles, was her closest confidant. During one of the Opera School's performances, Wang and Wu took the opportunity to develop an affair. At that time, this romantic case stirred the entire Opera School, and it was also talked about in the Beijing Pear Garden world. Because of the "school reputation", the Opera School could not help but make a slight expression. However, at that time, Wang Helin was at the height of his popularity among the students. Nineteen out of ten performances of the Opera School were his. What could be done? Therefore, Wu Suqiu was expelled from the Opera School at that time for the reason of "rectifying the school spirit". This is a page of romantic history of "Qiu'er" at the Opera School, and also the origin of her marriage with Wang Helin. This happened ten years ago.</p>
<p>After Several Changes, Wu Suqiu Became Popular</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu's mother is a socialite, a retired star, and has extremely exquisite skills. She saw through that her daughter was a valuable commodity, and she worked hard to decorate her, knowing that one day the commodity would meet a buyer. Since Wu Suqiu left school! She hired another famous teacher to teach her opera, and soon she joined a troupe to perform, and mixed for a few years. During that time, she went to the Northeast with Jin Shao, and finally formed her own troupe and went to Shanghai to perform. Relying on "Qiu'er"'s appearance and her mother's social skills, after a few performances of spinning cotton, the name Wu Suqiu was deeply imprinted in people's minds. And their mother and daughter? Naturally, they gained both fame and fortune. At this time, Wang Helin graduated from the Opera School, but he also became hoarse, and his voice changed, so he could no longer sing. He watched his lover Wu Suqiu become more and more popular day by day.</p>
<p>Love Changes, and the Beauty Belongs to Others</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu became popular, and her social circle became wider, and she knew more people. The famous eight young masters of Beiping often visited "Qiu'er"'s boudoir, the salt merchant's son Cha Er Shao, the East Xing Lou's young master He Er Ye, the nephew of the Heilongjiang military governor Wu Junsheng's nephew... In short, these纨绔膏梁子弟 followed like flies chasing a bad smell, and served like filial sons and virtuous grandsons. New-style cars in 1940 constantly came and went in front of Wu's house. Therefore, "Qiu'er"'s heart moved. Looking at Wang Helin, who was hoarse and didn't know when he could recover, and even if he recovered, he didn't know when he could become popular, it was really undesirable.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yipeng Will Leave Gengxin</h3>
<p>— Yiren</p>
<p>Change to Invite Jing Dynasty Actors to Perform; Bai Jialin and Others Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>In the Ping opera scene of the new autumn, there seems to be another lively scene. The Golden Grand Theater invited Cheng Yanqiu and Yang Baosen, and the Grand Theater invited Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu, all of whom will come to Shanghai one after another. At the same time, the Gengxin Stage, which has been performing "Journey to the West" for more than half a year, is also preparing to adjust the audience's taste. Recently, the owner of the stage, Dong Zhaobin, went north and personally invited Bai Jialin, a proud disciple of Gao Yankui, Kun actor Zhao Manyun, as well as Li Duokui, Jiang Shiyu, Zhao Bingxiao, Xiao Shoushan, Li Yiche, and many others. It is said that they can also arrive in Shanghai on the 27th, and are scheduled to take the stage on the 2nd or 3rd of next month. The old members Zhang Yipeng and Liu Wenkui are tired of performing "Journey to the West" and will take a temporary rest. However, it is still unknown whether they will take the stage again in the future. Perhaps Gengxin will restore its old policy and continue to invite Jing Dynasty actors.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Cunren</p>
<p>Yan Qiu arrived in Shanghai by plane a few days ago and stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel. The supporting actor Xiao Sheng Gu Yusun came with him, but Yang Baosen has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Since the Kun actor Qing Shan Zhang Shuxian's term at the Grand Theater expired, and Yu Sulian took over, the reputation has been mediocre. It is said that there will be a suspension of performance after the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Liu Hanchen, a civil and military old male actor at the Gong Wu Stage, recently married the Kun actor Wang Guilan, which is his third remarriage.</p>
<p>The famous martial arts actor Li Shaochun is scheduled to come to Shanghai to perform at the Tianchan Theater after the Double Ninth Festival. At that time, the Shanghai music lovers, in addition to listening to Yan Qiu's Qingyi and Fu Ying's old male roles, will also see Shaochun's martial arts plays, which will be suitable for adjusting their ears and eyes.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance of Qilin Tong, everyone pays close attention to it. Recently, there was a negotiation to invite him to sing for a month for 30,000 yuan, but he was not allowed to sell his favor. It is rumored that he will take a long-term rest, which is not a matter of how much the package money is.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: A Furious Rage for the Beauty</p>
<p>Because the roving bandits have arrived at Datong and are invading the capital, it will be a very quick thing. Weighing the pros and cons, it is still better to save the capital first. For example, if a person has internal and external diseases and is dying and needs medical treatment, the doctor can only treat the patient's internal diseases first, and then treat the external diseases. I hope you will help me to eliminate the roving bandits and secure the capital, and then return to Guanwai to deal with Manchuria." Zhang Cangqiu and Xu Jing all said: "General's words are very true. We are willing to follow the whip and stirrups and provide our services." Wu Sangui talked with them for a moment, and then Zhang Cangqiu and others said goodbye and left. From this day on, Xu Jing and Liao Yinying also moved into the barracks, and under the assignment of Sangui, they took the actual position of Bajong. Zhang Cangqiu, because Xu Liu and the two had been hired by Sangui, was fulfilling his own wishes, so that his brothers could gather together to serve the country. He went to thank Chai Ying. In the evening, he prepared some wine and meat and had a happy drink with Chen Fei, Xu Jing, Liu Yinying and the other four, which was considered a celebration of Xu and Liu's appointment. The two also thanked Zhang Cangqiu for his recommendation. When the wine was half-drunk, they talked about Wu Sangui again. Liu Yinying said to Xu Jing with a smile: "From the perspective of my little brother, General Wu is indeed a famous general of the time, wearing light fur and silk belts, elegant and unrestrained, and has the demeanor of an ancient Confucian general. However, if you look closely at his eyebrows, he is very frivolous, and between his words, he looks left and right. I am afraid that this person's temperament is somewhat capricious and easily emotional, and he will be complacent with a little gain. (179)</p>
