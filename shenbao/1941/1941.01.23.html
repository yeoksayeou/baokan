<p>華盛頓　美國務副卿威爾斯、昨日通吿蘇聯駐美大使鳥曼斯基、謂美對裝運飛機及汽油赴蘇、已解除道德上之禁運、美國務部並宣布、威爾斯已將此項決議以公函通知蘇使、該通知公函、謂羅斯福總統禁止飛機運往轟炸平民之國家之道德禁運、以後不適用於蘇聯、威爾斯致鳥曼斯基信函之原文稱、「逕啟者、美國政府於經吾人最近數度談話之後、已決定一九三九年十二月二日向報界宣布之政策、即通稱為「德道禁運、不再適用蘇維埃社會主義聯邦共和國、此項決定業已通知美國各有關之製造業者及出口商、」威爾斯與鳥曼斯基對國務部所常稱為「平常事務」之事、討論凡三月有餘、然觀察家相信、此次談話、其目的乃在建立美·蘇間更友好之關係、在以前「道德禁運」之下、幾乎所有飛機及其材料附件、均不得運往蘇聯、後羅斯福總統且將鉏與鋁等製造飛機必需品、亦列入禁運之內云、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間中立外交觀察家頃認、美國對運往蘇聯之飛機及汽油解除道德上之禁運為美國希望蘇聯表示友好及對遠東與美合作之一種姿態、此等觀察家經將此一事實與美國及其他各處種種事實為綜合觀察後、認美國已覺其與蘇聯密切合作之途徑業已毫無障碍、美、蘇合作之中、其尤要者、即為援助中國之合作、此一問題、或為美、蘇合作上最有效之共同立塲、因美國現已堅決助華、美官方久思建立一種基礎、以供美、蘇兩國共同進行、而控制日人之南進、許多外交專家相信、唯有蘇聯以兵力威脅日本之後、方始可限制日人此時向荷屬東印度、菲列濱及緬甸進攻、若干專家並以為、美國對蘇解除道德禁運、必係對蘇聯之遠東政策、予以道德上之鼓勵、而藉經由蘇聯之轉運以增加中國之飛機供給、或竟使蘇聯以其飛機運華、而合蘇聯隨後得向美購買飛機以資彌補、但專家又信、美國現時之飛機生產、乃專為應付英國之需、恐一時尙難應付蘇聯之大量訂購、外交人士謂、美國此種姿態、因大有利於遠東、而亦有利於歐洲局勢、美國或將使英、蘇趨於接近、亦未可知、若干外交人士又謂、美國此項動作、乃係暗示蘇聯苟與民主國合作、即可獲得美國之優惠、美國此項表示之全部語調、雖謂係暫時性質、然具有深切之意義、其致蘇聯駐美大使烏曼斯基之公函、係由美國副國務卿威爾斯簽署、該函已經國務部宜示、內容簡短而切實、行政部因承認改善對蘇關係之政治危險性、因天主敎徒及反對共產主義者、將利用此舉以攻擊羅斯福總統援助反全能國各民主國之誠意、但行政部顯已決定採用此項和睦手段、以測騐蘇聯之反應如何、許多專家最近均稱、唯有英·美·蘇聯合、方可擊敗軸心國家、此一溫良姿態、是否可認為向此途進行、現尙為一問題、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>

<h3 id="c6">黯淡景象之日本政治季節 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>日本第七十六屆國會，自客歲十二月二十六日召集開慕後，隨即休會，至隔昨開始議事。每年歲尾歲初之間，是日本照例的政治季節，也是其政局最形活躍之期。已往自由主義全盛時期不必說了，、即在憲政常規打破之後，還有濱田國松的有名辯難；中日戰爭期中，也有齋籐隆夫的驚人質詢，在軍部統制凌厲空前之際，獨作驚人之鳴，表示出議會的不甘雌伏；也多少透露了一點民間的眞正意向。然而這種往事是不會重見於此後的日本議會了！本屆議會獨以「大政翼贊」名義相標榜，可見其除却竭力贊助當局並遵勅通過預算而外，殆已不能別有作為。一向以政黨為憑藉的議員，在政黨解消之後，驟感無所依託；政府又復在事前多方佈置，並防杜政黨復活的企圖；右翼報紙更要求國會一意對美，將內政問題付之緩議，國會方面雖也循咧推出幾個質問發言人，但據昨日消息，業已決定停止了應有的質詢。照這樣，本屆議會大概可以抑鬱平淡的直到休會；以視正在激昂爭論中的美國議會固然氣象逈殊，即在日本，亦為六十年來空前未有的消沉。而最近將來，無論日本國運如何隆替，民間具何觀感，議會必中止其為政治的重要樞紐了。</p>
<p>日本政治上的這一演變，大概會引起舊的自由主義份子無限感慨；然而這却並非今日日方政局中的中心問題；因為九年以來，議會早已不能充分行使其應有任務。所値得注意的，到是在這樣一個危困交迫之秋，並沒有另外一個力量代替議會及政黨而興，眞正擔負起指導政治與上下協力的任務。近衛倡導導「新政體制運動」，用意原在補救政黨政治之衰，用了一個嶄新的組織和體系，團結各方實力，形成指導力量。但是一切初未如所預期，半載以來，宣傳固多於建樹，性能亦一再蛻變：及至近頃，也許近衛仍對之寄以重大期望，事實上已不復為人所置重。而原有政治體系的基礎，却泰半已遭破壞，致造成此度政治季節的黯淡景象；如果說這樣便算是發揮安定內政共同對外的效果，是任何人所難予置信的。</p>
<p>這在表面的現象，可謂平靜，但隱藏在這一現象下面的，依舊存在著無數矛盾和對立。議會所代表的不過是已經政黨所遺留下來的力量，那要算是最易於對付的一個，法春齋藤事件可資明證。且即以政黨分子而言，至今也尙未完全失去其原有的勢力：其在政黨解消後的種種活動以至獵官，都曾引起右翼分子的猛烈抨擊。在所謂「大政翼贊」體系當中。更復派系紛歧，綱羅萬有，近衛的一再變動內閣，可見其內部杌隍的一斑。目今議會雖然失却糾彈政府的機能，而在右翼分子以至親軍政客之流，對淤政府中樞反而肆意攻訐，昌言無忌：較之議會之必須遵循一定規程與合法程序者，將更使當局感到應付的煩難。是以即使日政府平靜渡過議會關頭之後，絕不能算是解決了對內的難關，而且假如日政府會遭受救治上危脅，那也必然來自國會以外。</p>
<p>在日議會復會的這幾天當中，多少引起一點內外波動的，僅屬松岡外相的外交演說。因為那不啻是對美總統爐邊談話國會咨文以至援助法案的的一個間接答覆。他在那一演說當中，除却縷述其已往「成就」而外，更强調着調整美日關係的必要，枰擊美方遠東的態度。恣態雖相當強硬，語調卻不無悲愴；縱觀全文，大體無非已往若干言輪的複述，較之羅斯福赫爾那種大氣磅礴的警吿譴責與呼籲，正不止大小巫之不同。其間唯一的積極建議，只是重彈親蘇外交的老調，而那又不過是在對外無出路之際的解嘲，並非眞具有何等決心信念，與其前此的側重對美外交如出一轍。其對美的種種非難，亦復空洞浮泛，耳熟能詳，在任何方面都難能發生何等有效反應。去年此際，有田的外交報告，雖盡是些空頭支票，却還坦白宣示了他的自信，不像松岡之僅僅表現其苦悶悲觀與徬徨，以點綴此一黯淡的議會。</p>
<p>目前太平洋的危機正復有加無已，任何有關列強都不能不以嚴重警惕加以注視；若單就日本國內所表現的種種景象而論，既無緊張之致，又乏壯烈之觀，似乎都不能與其擴展欲念企圖相配合。在此歷史的政治季節之中，更暴露其上下聯繫與協力的缺乏，如此而妄欲冒險，何難想像其前途！</p>

<h3 id="c36">英國軍費的浩大 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>英國軍費與日俱增，這篇是紐約泰晤士報駐輪敦訪員關於英國朝野協力籌款情形的報吿，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>英國人說他們願意耗盡最後一便士，以博取勝利，照現在的形勢，他們似乎很有把握。</p>
<p>英國在戰爭第一年中，平均每天消耗戰費五百三十萬鎊，但這不過是初期的統計，如今每天已增加到一千萬鎊。凡稍為熟悉戰時財政的人，更可以想到今後十二個月的戰費，每天將達一千二百五十萬鎊之鉅。</p>
<p>英國現在的財政情形和上次歐戰時不同。第一，上次歐戰時，英國的國債不過十萬萬鎊，現在已達一百萬萬鎊。其次，英國每年至少需戰費三十五萬萬鎊。試把英美作一比較，一九四〇年美國的支出共九十四萬萬四千餘萬美元，英國的支出，依每鎊折合美金四元計算，比美國超出四十五萬萬美元以上，其浩大可見。美國共有人口一萬萬三千一百萬，英國人口僅有四千八百萬，以如此少數的人，拿出如此鉅數的錢，將為賦稅史上空前未有的紀錄了。</p>
<p>但在事實上，財相伍德爵士並不叫這些人民如數拿出這筆錢。以納稅情形而論，一個已婚男子每年有一千鎊進款的，僅須付所得銳二百五十三鎊强。買一套衣服，納稅百分之十二，買一枚鑽戒或任何一件奢侈品，納稅百分之三十三强。這類稅收總額，僅為十五萬萬磅，與支出之類，相差沿遠</p>
<p>英國人當然還有別的籌款方法，總計一年之內，英國人民曾用儲蓄及認購公債等方法替政府籌得十一萬萬四千萬鎊，出售金證券也籌得五萬萬鎊。然而英國的支出仍舊不敷三萬萬六千萬鎊。</p>
<p>這種不敷之數，究竟怎樣籌措呢？是否要造成通貨膨漲？英國若不能從美國獲得借款接濟，是否即將戰敗？英國是否將效法德國竭澤而魚的經濟制度，繼續掙扎呢？此際雖無人敢加以斷定，但英國各經濟專家顯然很願意，把這三種方法不久都嚐試一下。</p>
<p>通貨膨漲一層早已實行了，不過性質並不十分嚴重。據統計，純由通貨膨漲的方法所籌得的款項，不過三萬萬鎊。至於向美國借款一層，英國官方一向審愼將事。他們說這是美國的一個立法問題，須由美國決定。他們承認需要美國借款。德國飛機每次向英國多投一枚炸彈，德國潛艇每次向英國多放一個魚雷，美國援助英國的重要性，也隨之增加。美國所可借予英國的八萬萬鎊，已有五萬萬鎊買了英國的軍火，而戰爭還不還是剛剛開頭。英國朝野現在一方面等待美國經由合法手續，援助英國，一方面則設法在本國另　財源。</p>
<p>英國在財政拮據的時候，往往提到德國的處境，遠不如英國，引以自慰。他們估計德國的戰費，每月需四十萬萬馬克，該國債務已達一千二百萬萬馬克，每年平均增加債務二百五十萬萬馬克。德國前在一九一四年，一九一八年及一九三三年三個時期，各種工業品還可獲得新市塲，用以抵償進口貨付款，此刻已無新的富源可供挹注，國社主義的經濟制度，勢必臨日暮途窮之境。</p>
<p>英國一方面雖洞燭德國的弱點，但也承認德國有可取法的地方。譬如德國提高生產，嚴厲限制日用品的消費，並使人民將節約所得，還諸國家。</p>
<p>英國並無這種制度，僅利用國民自動節約，以謀達到同樣的目的。自從戰爭發生以來，英國雖曾試行减少奢侈品的生產和消銷數量，並曾勸吿人民購用物品至最少限度，俾以所餘貢獻政府。但這種辦法迄未生效，各兵工廠工人賺錢愈多，購買力也愈大，中等階級雖和政府密切合作，但整個國家消費數量，較之平時，並未有顯著的减少，據某經濟專家統計，僅减少百分之五而已。</p>
<p>這種畸形狀態，自然不能放任，而須用新法補救。故今後或當繼續增加捐稅，並有人主張强迫限制消費。英國富人所有美國證券旣已强令交給政府，則一般人亦當以其一部份儲蓄貢獻政府。將來商店裏的貨色，也不再會像去年一般，色色俱全。「多節約，少消費」當是英國人一九四一年的信條吧。</p>

<p>公共租界工部局、為因財政困難、短細至鉅、特召開納稅外人特別大會、要求通過增加捐稅及執照費、該項大會、定於今日下午二時三十分、假跑馬廳之大看台上舉行、大會主席、業巳內定爲丹麥駐滬總領事兼領袖領事希爾担任、其議程爲（一）推舉大會秘書、（二）請爲通過增加（甲）地稅、（乙）市政總捐附加費百分之四十、（丙）特別房捐外加百分之四十、（三）請授權工部局自一月一日起至下屆納稅年會爲止、增加各項執照費、惟關於此問題、日本僑民、已提出全盤推翻之議案、至英美僑民、似可支持工部局加捐、是以大會中不但將發生劇烈辯論、且已決定最後由全體納稅外人舉手表決、</p>
<p>再度發表　收支概况</p>
<p>工部局再度發表收支概况云、查納稅外僑特別大會、已屆舉行之期、關於本局收支及虧空情形、前經為文詳細解釋、茲再擇要以吿納稅諸君、</p>
<p>虧空　情形</p>
<p>本局上年經常支出、超出預算的七百八十萬元、經常收入、比預計者的增四百六十萬兀、全年虧空、估計當為八百七十七萬三千元左右、（原預算書所列為五百五十七萬三千餘元、）上年十二月間、核准加發全體職員之生活費津貼、每月的需一百萬元、其中七十一萬四千元、係加於未執聘書之華籍職員者、本局收支情形、倘長此以下、則本年度的需虧空二千萬元、倘加捐之舉、延至四月實行、則所加之數、當非百分之四十而為百分之六十左右、</p>
<p>加捐　收入</p>
<p>總捐及地捐、倘照一厘征收、每年可得四十萬元、按照現行捐率百分之二十七征收、每年可得三千七百八十萬元、倘增加附加費百分之四十以後、則歲收可望增裕一千五百十二萬元、此外各項執照費修改以後、每年可望增收三百五十萬兀、以上兩項、抵補佔計之虧空以後、不敷一百四十萬元、擬即提高自用房屋之估價、以圖彌補、</p>
<p>預料將有　劇烈爭辯</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界納稅外僑特別大會、已定二十三日（即今日）午後在跑馬總會舉行、工部局方面固須增加二千萬元稅收、以應其一九四一年聞財務上需要、然納稅日人期望工部局更事撙節、且修改公共租界現行收稅制度、故大會中顯將發生公共租界有史以來最激烈之辯論、預料大會中除提交納稅人討論之重要建議外、並可測知或將在四月間納稅外僑年會中提出之其他重要更改辦法、如納稅日人擬更改選舉制度、甚至修改地皮章程等是、</p>
<p>日方修正　收稅制度</p>
<p>大會中將加討論者，爲凱自威提議。卡萊附議、之「第　件決議案」內要求納稅人核准地皮捐附加稅百分之四十、市政總捐百分之二十七、特捐百分之二十四、及工部局經濟委員會提建之續增執照費、納稅日人反對此項議案、已通過修正案要求工部局「更事撙節、並在根本上研究修改現行收稅制度之可能性、庶可應用更公允之制度、」預料他國納稅外僑擁護日人之修正案者、頗不乏人、</p>
<p>舉債彌補　緩不濟急</p>
<p>該修正案雖主張工部局估計不足二千萬之數、舉債彌補、以待收稅制度之修改、但若干人士以爲此法頗多困難、因工部局之財務狀態、實須立即採取切實之步驟也、又納稅英僑亦已通過修正案、主張暫從本年一月一日起增收自用房屋之附加稅百分之四十、以待重行確切估價、對租用房產徵收附加稅、則以較一九三七年之估價增加白分之四十爲限、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報編輯高爾德近游重慶，謁蔣委員長後為文紀之。原文略　，今有一人，得全球四分之一人民之絕對效忠與服從，即自由中國之領袖蔣委員長是也。華軍經一戰有半之苦戰後，日本卒悟唯得蔣委長之同意，始能獲致和平。記者曾迭次謁蔣委長，今復晤有人妄稱為「軍閥獨裁者，」乃見其胸襟之曠達，與日俱進，巳成民治典型　偉人矣。</p>
<p>最後勝利信念彌深</p>
<p>凡蒙蔣委長接見者，一致相信獨立中國之最後勝利；及沿自由民治方針建設中國，蔣委長實舉足輕重。其態度之堅定，及信念之彌深，未有甚於今日者。蔣委員長悠然有古君子風，但在在顯露其內在的活力與果敢，彼在其迭遭轟炸而迄未中彈之私邸客廳內接見記者，身穿樸素之卡其布軍裝，目光銳利而和善，笑容滿面，入廳即與記者熱烈握手邀坐。</p>
<p>殷切垂注上海民衆</p>
<p>蔣委長首對上海「孤島」民衆與情况，殷殷垂訽，記者答以上海逈非重慶可比。蔣委長續稱：「吾人皆甚感佩美商刊物與在華美僑所表示之友好態度，君因抱獨立的立塲而遇困難，吾人頗明瞭並覺君已顯示偉大勇氣，以擁護君所信為正直之目的，從而發表新聞與社論，不因畏懼暴力而動搖。」蔣委長繼乃垂詢其他被「通緝」美僑之福利等問題，謂傳聞具中有一美僑上居虹口，記者吿以並非事實，蔣委長乃表滿意，並囑記者請該美僑善自珍重。蔣委長對上海同胞之態度，關切彌殷，謂深信上悔與各地國人，無不愛國情切，更希望記者將其中國已　苦盡甘來之信念，轉吿國人。</p>
<p>中國已人民治陣營</p>
<p>蔣委長旋談戰後中國之前途等廣泛問題，自蔣委長以下，莫不深信戰爭結束中國必獲勝利，而對日本遭遇中國苦戰，最後必歸毀敗一點，從無絲毫疑慮。或有以中國之發展將否為「獨裁制」所阻為問者，殊不知蔣委長竭力反對極權主義。據稱「中國人民秉性崇尙民治，中國已投入民治國陣營，中國在戰前早已擇定此途，決堅持至戰爭終了，而日後亦必續以民治途徑是循」</p>
<p>美使詹森發表見解</p>
<p>關於此點，記者曾徵詢各方人士而獲種種解答，如美大使詹森謂「中國正在革命期間猝遇戰事，惟戰事結束時，革命趨勢之繼續存在，乃勢所必然，以歷史目光側觀統盤事件，渠覺外人對於中國有迫不及待之概，因其不迅謀滿足西方人士心理之解決也！抑中國必覔自己之途徑，逐漸邁進。」</p>
<p>戰爭結束憲法實施</p>
<p>記者又叩蔣委長，國民參政會是否為將來民治途中之極重要指示牌，據答，此乃暫時辦法，戰爭吿終後，吾人即將自由民治的新憲法，完全付諸實施，並將循美國及其他大民治國先例，容納多黨，以代目下之一黨制，目必召開議會，舉行大　，引用整個民治制度，美國乃最偉大之民治國，中國將儘實用範圍，追從美國之先例。</p>

<p>— 沈達齡</p>
<p>融五講經會第八决講經，由沈達齡講從自己做起，為五敎之听同。</p>
<p>禮記中庸言誠者自成也，而道自道也。大學言母自欺，言自明。有諸己而后求諸人，無諸己而后非諸人。論語言吾未見能見其過而內自訟者也，為仁山己，行己有恥，古之學者為己，修己以敬，修己以安人，修已以安百姓，君子求諸己。孟子言自反而不縮，自反而縮，禍福無不自己求之者，引詩自求多福，引太甲自作孽不可活。又云有是四端（仁義禮智）而自謂能者，自賊者也，行有不得者，皆反求諸己，人必自侮而後人侮，家必自毀　　人毀，國必自伐而後人伐。自暴者不可與有言，自窠者不可與有為，言非禮義，謂之自暴，不能居仁由義，謂之自棄，君子深造之以道，欲其自得之也。君子必自反，儒書之注重自己，剴切詳明。</p>
<p>老子三十三章，自知者明，自勝者强。莊子齊物論，自知則知之，人間世古之至人，先存諸己而後存諸人，　充苻，計子之德，不足以自反耶，大宗帥，適人之適，而不自適其適，不能自解者，物有結之。</p>
<p>佛經言自性，言自度，言自證，言自行化他，又名自利利他，諸法各有不變不改之性，謂之自性。自度者，先度自身，即渡生死海，至湼槃岸也。第一義之眞理，非由他得而自己證悟者，名為自證，上求菩提，自利也，下化衆生，利他也。聲聞緣覺之行唯自利，諸佛菩薩之行兼利他，此道與釋亦注重自己也。</p>
<p>耶敎舊的耶利米書四十八章，摩押受懲罰，因自高自傲，居心自大。四十九章，以束受懲罰，因心中的在傲自欺，耶利米哀歌，活人因自己的罪受罰，為何發怨言呢？我們當深深考察自己的行為。以西結書第十八章，義人的善果，必歸自己，惡人的惡報，也必歸自己。何西阿吾第十章，你們必為自已裁種公義，就能收割慈愛。西番雅書第三章，只是你們從早起來，就在一切事上敗壞自己。哈該書第一章，兩言你們要省察自己的行為。</p>
<p>古蘭經云，余今垂示儆誡，願其自省，惡人奈不自省其咎。彼輩甘於自棄，此誠孽由自作，汝輩何不自反，逆徒自招之禍，固未有不至者。夫為善者自益，為惡者自損，汝輩之災禍，有汝輩所自為者，自害而害及家庭，若臨以災禍，由其自召，善士必有善報，當自求光明，彼輩實自取自咎，為自身廣行施濟，此爲至善，若自邂鄙吝者，此輩其後必昌，各人自知其所為者，此耶與回亦注重自己也。</p>
<p>是故人人認識自己，最為要緊，一方面勉勵自己，是積極的，一方面警戒自己，是消極的。願以五敎相同之注重自己，與諸君共勉之。</p>

<p>鄔先生也回來吃中飯。吃過中飯，又攙着阿大出門去了。。鄔師母在家裏做女紅，喂奶，…到四點鐘左右，又出去接阿大。…他們的唯一的娘姨幹着燒飯，洗衣服，收拾房間，倒馬桶等等工作。</p>
<p>日子刻板的，永遠缺乏變化似的溜過去，溜過去了。星期日，弄堂裏的人才見鄔先生一家統統跑出去了。那是他們去探望鄔先生的爸爸，或者去附近的兒童公園的。</p>
<p>生活顯得忙迫，艱難，不能再節約。然而沒有怨尤，沒有歎息。也許是因為根本沒有讓你道麼做的閒暇。鄔先生和他的太太是愛的結合。鄔師母實踐了她的「同嘗甘苦」的諾言。只有時鄔先生禁不住抱愧，覺得對不起他的太太，也對不起孩子們。</p>
<p>一天天這樣呆滯，平凡的過下去。正在這時候，外面的世界可大大的轉變了！物價的高潮也不時冲激到這僻靜的一角。鄔師母開始訴說小菜眞貴，一元錢三隻菜，叫人在小菜塲裏大兜圈子！同時米，房租，什麽都飛騰起來了！</p>
<p>鄔先生服務着的那個銀行裏加了二决津貼。但是那于事實尠有補益。津貼的蝸步追不上米，房租，日用品的價格的在跳！為了這個，鄔先生不能不蹙眉。鄔師母在她的本位上，分享了她男人的憂慮。</p>
<p>於是有一天，趁他們的唯一的娘姨借故辭去時，鄔師母提議說：「我們不用娘姨也行。這樣工錢連吃，不是可以省却三十多元錢？」</p>
<p>這樣決定了。鄔師母越加忙起來了。她幾乎接替了娘姨的全部工作。鄔先生也增添了不少瑣事。天濛濛亮，鄔師母就起床了，到晚上九點鐘才把碗碟洗凈。眼皮儘重甸甸的往下壓，她還得趁孩子們熟睡時，做一些女紅。鄔先生也不睡覺，他要利用這個時間看一些書，或者寫一點東西寄往報館裏去換錢。</p>
<p>「這樣還不是很好？」鄔師母常常笑着對鄔先生說。「你瘦了，親愛的。你太辛苦了！」「那裏？沒有！」鄔師母强辯</p>
<p>但是有一天，這一對「賢伉儷」竟然吵架了！吵架的原因是瑣屑到不足道：是一個星期日的早晨，鄔師母遲買了粥菜，孩子們嚷着要吃粥。於是鄔師母說：「阿大你去買！」一鄔先生正在刮鬍鬚，聽到這句話有點礙耳。「你這是什麼意思？你爽快就叫我去！為什麼要轉灣抺角的？」</p>
<p>這樣就吵起來了！兩個開始控訴半月來生活所賜予的悲苦和壓迫。生活猶如一條穢汚的河，他們就在它裏面掙扎着。沒有歡笑歌唱。他們都不錯</p>
<p>鄔師母沒吃早飯就洗衣了。那天早晨，弄堂裏的人看見鄔先生買了一大綑大餅，油條，急急地跑回家去。這小小的風波就此平息了。</p>

<h3 id="c105">怎樣實現理想 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 同芳</p>
<p>有人把理想解釋做妄想和幻想，認為那只是人們意想中的空中樓閣，永遠沒有實現的可能。從心理學的研究上，我們知道這是錯誤的。妄想是精神病患者所表現的一種病症，是沒有實現可能性的假的信念。幻想也是一種精神病傾向的表現，就病症的程度說，較妄想更為紊亂而無目標，患者的行為完全陷入錯亂的瘋在病態</p>
<p>理想與妄想和幻想最顯著的不同，就在牠是以社會及時代的客觀的背景為基礎，不超乎事實而對未來的事業和工作作一番合理的期望。牠是一種正確的觀念，也可說是有條理的計劃。這種觀念和計劃，是受了事實的影響而產生的。</p>
<p>理想旣有實現的可能性，那麼我們應該怎樣促進牠的實現呢？</p>
<p>第一，要把握現實。理想與現實有着極密切的聯繋，理想的基礎，須建立在現實的磐石上。燦爛巍峨的理想之宮，除非緊握住現實，盡量地利用它，改善它，是不能築成的。因此每個人要希望有美滿的將來，就得在目前努力，定下一種合理的生活信條。</p>
<p>第二，要按步就序，逐步完成。無論怎樣高聳偉大的建築，匠人總是用一個個磚瓦砌上去的，每個小小的動作，會慢慢地實現起工程師理想中的房屋。所以要希望任何理想能實現，就得先把大目標分做小步驟，集中力量，慢慢地逐步做去；一次的成功，就可增加我們的自信心，給予第二步工作一個鼓勵，目標旣近，理想的實現，就有很大的把握了。</p>
<p>第三，要堅持忍耐的精神。頽廢　喪的心理狀態，是實現理想的致命的打擊。偉大的事功，必賴有百折不撓的精神和堅忍持久的毅力。遇到挫折，便心灰意冷，沒有勇氣去作第二次的嘗試的人，要想實現他的理想是很難的。</p>
<p>照着上述三點做去，便可以打破一般人認為理想是不能實現的錯誤觀念。理想決非「烏托邦，」憑着你堅毅自信和不斷的努力，定可美滿實現。</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Formally Notifies the Soviet Union to Lift the Moral Embargo, Seeking to Establish a More Friendly Relationship and to Cooperate in the Far East to Aid China and Prevent Japan's Southern Advance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington – U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday notified Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky that the U.S. has lifted the moral embargo on shipping airplanes and gasoline to the Soviet Union. The U.S. Department of State also announced that Welles had notified the Soviet Ambassador of this decision in an official letter. The official letter stated that President Roosevelt's moral embargo prohibiting the shipment of airplanes to countries bombing civilians no longer applies to the Soviet Union. The original text of Welles' letter to Umansky stated, "Dear Mr. Ambassador, after our recent series of talks, the United States Government has decided that the policy announced to the press on December 2, 1939, commonly referred to as the 'Moral Embargo,' no longer applies to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This decision has been notified to all relevant manufacturers and exporters in the United States." Welles and Umansky discussed what the State Department often refers to as "routine matters" for more than three months. However, observers believe that the purpose of these talks is to establish a more friendly relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Under the previous "Moral Embargo," almost all airplanes and their materials and attachments were not allowed to be shipped to the Soviet Union. Later, President Roosevelt also included materials necessary for manufacturing airplanes, such as zinc and aluminum, in the embargo. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – Neutral diplomatic observers here recently recognized that the U.S. lifting the moral embargo on airplanes and gasoline to the Soviet Union is a gesture of the U.S. hoping for Soviet friendship and cooperation in the Far East. After comprehensively observing this fact along with various facts in the U.S. and other places, these observers believe that the U.S. has realized that the path of close cooperation with the Soviet Union is now unobstructed. Among U.S.-Soviet cooperation, the most important is cooperation in aiding China. This issue may be the most effective common ground for U.S.-Soviet cooperation because the U.S. is now determined to help China, and U.S. officials have long sought to establish a foundation for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to jointly prevent the Japanese from advancing southward. Many diplomatic experts believe that only when the Soviet Union threatens Japan with military force can the Japanese be restricted from attacking the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Burma at this time. Some experts even believe that the U.S. lifting the moral embargo on the Soviet Union will morally encourage the Soviet Union's Far East policy and increase China's supply of airplanes through transshipment via the Soviet Union, or even allow the Soviet Union to transport its airplanes to China, and then the Soviet Union can purchase airplanes from the U.S. to compensate. However, experts also believe that the U.S.'s current airplane production is dedicated to meeting the needs of the United Kingdom, and it may be difficult to meet the Soviet Union's large orders for a while. Diplomatic officials said that this U.S. posture is greatly beneficial to the Far East and also beneficial to the situation in Europe. The U.S. may bring the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union closer together, which is also unknown. Some diplomatic officials also said that this U.S. action is an implication that if the Soviet Union cooperates with democratic countries, it can obtain preferential treatment from the U.S. The entire tone of this U.S. expression, although said to be temporary in nature, has deep significance. The official letter to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky was signed by U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles. The letter has been shown by the Department of State, and the content is concise and practical. The administrative department recognizes the political dangers of improving relations with the Soviet Union because Catholics and opponents of communism will use this move to attack President Roosevelt's sincerity in helping democratic countries against totalitarian countries, but the administrative department has obviously decided to adopt this reconciliation method to test the Soviet Union's reaction. Many experts have recently stated that only a joint effort by the United Kingdom, the U.S., and the Soviet Union can defeat the Axis powers. Whether this gentle posture can be considered as moving in this direction is still a question. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Washington – Attorney General Jackson said last night that the government plans to enact laws to detain dangerous alien elements in order to prevent the secret monopoly and "leaking of intelligence" by German Americans, to obstruct the national defense program, and to prevent the circulation of totalitarian propaganda. He also said that it is necessary to request Congress to enact laws to establish a way to deal with alien obstructive elements other than deportation, "because deportation is almost impossible in the current world situation."

<h3 id="e3">The Relationship Between the U.S. and Japan is Impossible to be Close; The U.S. Embargo Was Caused by Japan; Saving the Catastrophe Still Depends on the One Who Tied the Bell <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington – Senior government leaders, including Secretary of State Hull, refused to comment yesterday on Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's speech in the Diet. However, people close to the government believe that the tone of the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech seems calmer than before. However, these people also said that the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech clearly declares that there are many differences in the views of the U.S. and Japan, and they believe that a split is possible at any time. Hull's opinion of Matsuoka's speech, with Matsuoka's remarks on the New Order in Asia, according to people close to the government, is helpful to Hull's view several weeks ago, that Japan's connection with the Axis powers aims to promote a great revolution against the current world system. In Matsuoka's speech, the traditional interests of the U.S. in East Asia are generally denied. As for his remarks on the conflict between Thailand and Vietnam, people here are particularly concerned, believing it to be the prelude to Japan's direct intervention. If Japanese troops really move in Thailand, this place will inevitably pay serious attention because the place is adjacent to Singapore. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – People here are closely studying the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in the Diet. Officials have not expressed their opinions, and newspapers have not had time to comment due to the late arrival of Matsuoka's remarks. However, the general impression is that Matsuoka's remarks have not changed the policy. Matsuoka advised the United States to use its best efforts to save the civilization catastrophe and recognized this as the U.S.'s treatment plan, but Matsuoka did not apply this plan to Japan. People who closely observe the situation in the Far East said that Matsuoka's remarks show that the gap between the two countries is still far away and that it is not easy to seek true closeness. Matsuoka criticized the United States for implementing the embargo, but he did not know that the U.S. embargo was caused by Japan's actions.</p>
<p>U.S. Feels Threatened, Only Military Build-Up</p>
<p>In view of Japan's actions, the U.S. has no choice but to adopt a military build-up plan, so the raw materials needed for national defense are embargoed. The Japanese side declared that under certain circumstances, it would go to war with the U.S. It is a big mistake for Japan to try to force the U.S. to maintain neutrality with this threat because this declaration only makes Americans work harder. Matsuoka said that given some time, the Nazi-style New World Order will eventually be established. It should be known that the world ruled by the Nazis is definitely not something that the U.S. can agree with. It is too contradictory for Matsuoka to make this remark on the one hand and expect the U.S. to save the coming catastrophe on the other hand. Matsuoka's remark only makes the coming catastrophe come faster unless the U.S. prepares to be commanded by Japan, but the U.S. certainly does not prepare to accept it. Observers commented on Matsuoka's expression of surprise at the U.S. recognition that its first line of defense is in the central Pacific, saying that what we need to keep in mind is that the U.S. has never threatened Japan, but Japanese cabinet members openly stated that Japan will go to war with the U.S. under certain circumstances. Since the U.S. has been threatened, how can it not pay attention to national defense? Moreover, Matsuoka said that the responsibility for maintaining peace should be equally borne by both sides and should not be blamed on one side. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chinese Commentary on Matsuoka's Speech</p>
<p>Chongqing – China commented on Matsuoka's declaration in the Japanese Diet, saying that its content, in addition to deliberately expressing satisfaction with the mutual relations between Japan and Latin America and expressing some sympathy to Thailand, has no novelty. However, there is one layer that is meaningful and worthy of attention, that is, there are no clear threatening words for the United Kingdom and the U.S. Japan, after joining the Axis Alliance, has threatened other countries that want to participate, and the current war in Europe and Asia, with war. That is, the country that wants to prevent Japan's ambition has also been threatened. At this time, the situation has changed, and the U.S. has shouted loudly, and the intimidation has lost its effect. Opportunists are not prepared to take any action until the European Axis powers occasionally win. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>

The Soviet government has not taken any action to promote the above-mentioned suggestions, so the subsequent steps must be initiated by the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e6">A Gloomy Japanese Political Season <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The 76th Japanese Diet, which was convened on December 26th of last year, adjourned immediately after its opening ceremony and began its proceedings yesterday. The period between the end of each year and the beginning of the next is Japan's regular political season, and it is also the time when its political situation is most active. There is no need to mention the heyday of liberalism in the past; even after the constitutional conventions were broken, there was Hamada Kunimatsu's famous debate; during the Sino-Japanese War, there was also Saito Takao's shocking questioning. Amidst the unprecedentedly fierce military control, he made a surprising sound, showing that the Diet was unwilling to be subservient and revealing a bit of the true intentions of the people. However, this kind of past event will not be seen again in the Japanese Diet after that! This Diet is uniquely branded with the name "Taisei Yokusankai" (Imperial Rule Assistance Association), which shows that it can hardly do anything other than exert its best efforts to support the authorities and pass the budget in accordance with the imperial edict. The members of the Diet, who used to rely on political parties, suddenly felt helpless after the dissolution of the political parties; the government also made many arrangements in advance and prevented the attempt to revive the political parties; the right-wing newspapers even demanded that the Diet focus on the U.S. and postpone the discussion of domestic political issues. Although the Diet also followed the example of putting forward a few question speakers, according to yesterday's news, it has been decided to stop the due questioning. In this way, this Diet can probably be depressed and bland until the adjournment. Compared with the U.S. Congress, which is currently in heated debate, the atmosphere is certainly very different. Even in Japan, it is an unprecedented slump in 60 years. In the near future, no matter how prosperous or declining Japan's national fortune is, or what the people's feelings are, the Diet will certainly cease to be an important hub of politics.</p>
<p>This evolution in Japanese politics will probably evoke infinite emotion from the old liberal elements; however, this is not the central issue in today's Japanese political situation because the Diet has long been unable to fully perform its due tasks for nine years. What is worth paying attention to is that in such an autumn of danger and distress, there is no other force that has replaced the Diet and the political parties and truly shouldered the task of guiding politics and coordinating the upper and lower levels. Konoe advocated the "New Political System Movement," intending to remedy the decline of party politics and unite the strengths of all parties with a brand-new organization and system to form a guiding force. However, everything was not as expected. For half a year, propaganda was more than construction, and the performance changed again and again. Until recently, perhaps Konoe still placed great expectations on it, but in fact, it was no longer valued by people. The foundation of the original political system has been mostly destroyed, resulting in the bleak scene of this political season. If it is said that this is to exert the effect of stabilizing domestic politics and jointly dealing with foreign countries, it is difficult for anyone to believe it.</p>
<p>This may be calm on the surface, but hidden beneath this phenomenon, there are still countless contradictions and oppositions. The Diet represents only the forces left over by the political parties, which is the easiest to deal with. The Tasuku Saito incident can serve as proof. Even in terms of party members, they have not completely lost their original power so far: their various activities and even the hunting of official positions after the dissolution of the parties have aroused fierce criticism from right-wing elements. In the so-called "Taisei Yokusankai" system, there are even more factions and all-encompassing. Konoe's repeated changes in the cabinet can be seen from a glimpse of its internal instability. Although the Diet has lost the function of impeaching the government, the right-wing elements and even the pro-military politicians are wantonly attacking the central government and speaking without scruples, which will make the authorities feel more difficult to deal with than the Diet, which must follow certain procedures and legal procedures. Therefore, even if the Japanese government peacefully passes the Diet juncture, it cannot be regarded as solving the internal difficulties, and if the Japanese government suffers a crisis in treatment, it will inevitably come from outside the Diet.</p>
<p>During these few days of the resumption of the Diet, what caused a little internal and external fluctuation was only Foreign Minister Matsuoka's diplomatic speech because it was nothing more than an indirect answer to the U.S. President's fireside chat, congressional message, and aid bill. In that speech, in addition to recounting his past "achievements," he emphasized the necessity of adjusting U.S.-Japan relations and criticized the U.S.'s attitude towards the Far East. Although the attitude was quite tough, the tone was not without sadness. Looking at the full text, it was generally nothing more than a repetition of some past statements, which was not different from Roosevelt and Hull's such grand condemnations and appeals. The only positive suggestion was to rehash the old tune of pro-Soviet diplomacy, which was nothing more than a self-deprecation in the absence of a way out for foreign countries, and did not really have any determination or belief, which was the same as its previous emphasis on diplomacy with the U.S. His various criticisms of the U.S. were also empty and superficial, familiar and well-known, and could hardly produce any effective response in any way. At this time last year, Arita's diplomatic report, although full of empty checks, frankly declared his self-confidence, unlike Matsuoka, who only expressed his depression, pessimism, and hesitation to embellish this bleak Diet.</p>
<p>At present, the crisis in the Pacific is increasing, and any relevant powers cannot but pay attention to it with serious vigilance. If we only talk about the various phenomena shown in Japan, there is neither tension nor magnificence, and it seems that they cannot be coordinated with its desire for expansion. In this historical political season, it further exposes the lack of connection and cooperation between the upper and lower levels. It is difficult to imagine its future if it wants to take risks in this way!</p>

<p>Washington – Kennedy told the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that the power to accelerate the national defense program is extremely needed. He testified to the House for the "Aid to Democratic Countries Act," but he said that he "deeply opposes the current form of the bill." He suggested organizing a congressional committee to discuss aid to Britain with Roosevelt and advocated that the President's power to lease U.S. supplies to civilian countries should be subject to time limits. He told Dingham, a Republican congressman from Massachusetts who opposed the bill, that if the U.S. sends the navy to fight or transport for Britain, the war is almost unavoidable. He said that the bill gives Roosevelt the power to write a blank check. He also briefly outlined his position, saying that he should do his best to help Britain because it is related to our interests. He said that Britain has been in crisis since September 1939, but if someone thinks that the so-called crisis means that Britain will succumb in 60 to 90 days, then I really don't know what they are based on. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Kennedy stated his views on the U.S. aid to Britain bill to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, saying that people in the British government do not have a unified opinion on the issue of whether the U.S. should join the war. Some said that if the U.S. joins the war, it will definitely try to carry it out to the end, while others said that if the U.S. joins the war, the U.S.'s material assistance will not be delivered to Britain as quickly as possible, which is not conducive to Britain's war efforts. Many people in the British government also feel that they have not yet obtained all the assistance they can hope for from the U.S. When the Foreign Affairs Committee asked him to predict that there will be serious events in the next six or seventy days, Kennedy replied that he did not know what it meant, and there were many things in the military situation that he did not know, such as why the German army allowed 300,000 British troops to escape from Dunkirk. He was deeply puzzled. If the German air force was indeed invincible, as the German side said, then there should have been an opportunity to wipe out this British army at that time. Also, why didn't the German side inflict greater destruction on the concentration points of British industry? This is also something he does not understand. If the German side really has the power to dominate the sky, then a serious situation will eventually be realized, but the German side has not yet shown that it has this power. When the Foreign Affairs Committee asked him if he knew the purpose of the British war, Kennedy replied that he certainly did not know. The Foreign Affairs Committee asked Kennedy whether he thought that the U.S. should try to find out the nature of the purpose of the British war and then provide aid to Britain. Kennedy replied that he did not understand this issue and that he thought it was a matter for the State Department. Kennedy also said that some important people in the British government felt that they had not yet obtained certain assistance that they expected from the U.S. Fieschnay asked whether it was gratifying to declare that the U.S. would provide assistance to Britain in a possible continental invasion, so as not to disappoint the British people. He replied, "I don't believe we will formally do this." Fieschnay also asked whether the saying that Britain is now socialist is true. He replied that the Labour Party and the Socialist Party are now becoming important. No one can say that the situation will return to its previous state.

<p>The Agreement Was Signed Twelve Years Ago; Extended Five Times, Yet a New Agreement Has Not Been Concluded</p>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet-Japanese Fishery Agreement was signed on January 23, 1928. Subsequently, temporary agreements were successively signed to extend it on May 25, 1936, December 28 of the same year, December 29, 1937, April 2, 1939, and December 31, 1939. It expired on December 30, 1940. Recognizing that a new agreement could not be signed before the expiration date, the Soviet and Japanese governments specifically agreed to the following terms: (1) The Soviet-Japanese Fishery Agreement signed on January 23, 1928, and its annexes, shall remain in effect until December 31, 1941. (2) The current draft agreement will be replaced by a new one. The Soviet and Japanese governments are in the process of negotiating this matter and will complete it by the end of this year. To certify the above terms, this draft agreement was signed by representatives of both sides under government authorization. The signatories were Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, and Tatekawa, the Japanese Ambassador. The date was January 20, 1941. The draft agreement consists of two copies, each party holding one. (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Soviet Union Issues Note to Japan</p>
<p>Moscow – Regarding the provisional fishery agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Japan, Molotov sent the following note to Tatekawa on the 20th of this month: "To Your Excellency Ambassador Tatekawa, regarding the provisional fishery agreement signed today, I hereby present the following points to Your Excellency: (1) Regarding the special contracts established on November 3, 1938, and their annexes, the Soviet government agrees to renew them according to the previous terms, with a deadline of December 31, 1941. These special contracts permit the Japanese people to utilize fishing grounds 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40 and fishing districts 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 120, 708, 742, 743, 757, 758, 766, 767, 775, 776, 782, 829, 830, 837, 838, 839, 842, 847, 848, 854, 855, 857, 858, 860, 861, 866, 867, 975, 980, 981, 984, 985, 986 belonging to the aforementioned fishing grounds. (2) In 1941, Soviet state-owned organizations may catch 500 poods of salmon within the previously stipulated limits. (3) The lease terms for fishing grounds 410, 527, 529, 553, 557, 558, 1083, which expired in 1940, will be auctioned this year. (4) Japanese fishermen leasing Soviet fishing areas along the Pacific coast, as well as Japanese people who have signed special contracts with the Soviet government, may still purchase 'Kamchatka Company' shares from the National Bank in 1941, with a price of 32.5 rubles per 100 rubles of face value. These shares can be used to pay rent, taxes, etc., and will be accepted by 'Dalryba' (Soviet Far East Fishery Trust Company) at face value. However, if the pure gold content (based on the New York market gold price and the Japanese yen exchange rate) on the day before the purchase of 'Kamchatka Company' shares changes compared to the pure gold content on April 1, 1939 (based on the New York exchange rate), the amount paid for purchasing the company's shares will be adjusted accordingly so that the pure gold value of the payment equals the pure gold value on April 1, 1939. (5) When paying rent and fishing taxes in 1941, Japanese fishermen leasing Soviet fishing areas along the Pacific coast, as well as Japanese people who have signed special contracts with the Soviet government, should add 20% to the amount paid. Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Molotov." Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa immediately replied that he would repeat every word of the above note and that he fully understood the contents of the note. (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Japanese Fishermen Pay Increased Rent and Taxes</p>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet Union and Japan have signed the 1941 fishery draft agreement. Before the signing, Molotov and Tatekawa had negotiated for three months. Compared to the 1940 draft agreement, the 1941 draft agreement has one important feature: the rent and taxes paid by the Japanese side have increased by 20%. In 1940, the Japanese side paid a total of 8,965,907 rubles. According to the new draft agreement, Japanese fishermen will pay an additional 20%. Furthermore, the detailed provisions regarding residual value are specified in Molotov's note to Tatekawa. This will prevent losses due to fluctuations in the Japanese yen. In summary, the new draft agreement will further develop the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Shipbuilding Dispute Also Resolved</p>
<p>Moscow – According to the new Soviet-Japanese fishery draft agreement, the two sides will sign a new one this year. A mixed commission has been formed for these negotiations. Furthermore, during the draft agreement negotiations, the Matsuo Shipbuilding Company incident was resolved. The details of the incident are as follows: "On September 18, 1936, the Soviet trade representative in Japan signed a contract with Matsuo Shipbuilding Company to build three ships. The contract stipulated that if there were any breaches, a penalty of 10% of the total contract amount would be imposed. After the Soviet government signed the contract, it paid 1,647,750 Japanese yen in advance. On March 12, 1938, Matsuo Shipbuilding Company notified the Soviet trade representative that the contract had been canceled, but it did not fulfill the penalty payment and the reimbursement of the 1,647,750 yen paid by the Soviet side. Currently, both sides have reached an agreement. The Japanese side agrees to reimburse 1,647,750 yen and a penalty of 300,000 yen. At the same time, the Japanese government guarantees that the 1,647,750 yen can be reimbursed within a few days." (TASS dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

This offensive was also carefully prepared, with patrols sent out every night to obtain intelligence about the Italian defenses and to discover that the tank traps around Tobruk were extremely deep and required ladders to enter and measure their size. The outer defenses of Tobruk are thirty miles in circumference and have a second line of defense, eleven miles in circumference, which is different from Bardia.

<h3 id="e26">The Alliance Between Germany and Italy Enters a Stage of Closer Cooperation; Italy Seeks Aid from Germany with Humility and Submissiveness; US Expansion of Aid to Britain Causes Unease in Both Countries <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London: The diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" stated that Hitler and Mussolini met in Berchtesgaden. For propaganda purposes, the German and Italian sides are still shrouded in mystery, but he dares to say that the purpose of the meeting is quite simple: to hand over the Italian war machine to German management. The fact that the meeting place was not on the Italo-German border, as in previous meetings, but in Berchtesgaden, is sufficient to show that Mussolini is now in a subordinate position. This humility may be intolerable to Italian pride, and Italian propagandists will use excuses to cover it up, but it is a fact that Mussolini sought German aid at the meeting and had to accept German conditions. German conditions were to command the Italian army, even if this is not apparent on the surface, it is indeed the case in practice. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the talks between Hitler and Mussolini, Berlin stated today that the main purpose of the German-Italian alliance at present is to consolidate the victories already achieved this year. This is the plan for this meeting between the two leaders and their advisors. Both sides have fully agreed on all issues. In response to questions from foreign reporters, the spokesman said that the discussions involved more other countries and less France. The spokesman also acknowledged that the taking of diplomatic action has been thoroughly considered in the meeting. Germany is determined not to repeat the mistakes of the World War, so it must create a diplomatic front against Britain. Therefore, Germany's foreign policy must advance simultaneously with military strategy. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome: According to what was said here yesterday when entertaining the press, the information included in the announcement of the talks between Hitler and Mussolini contained more information than initially seen. The overall review of various military and political issues by the two leaders is of great significance. The meeting process was that Hitler and Mussolini had a long talk first, and then the foreign ministers of the two countries participated in the second decision. The cordial atmosphere of the talks further dispelled rumors of tension between the Axis powers, and the complete agreement of opinions is a sign of satisfaction with the meeting by both sides. Given the close relationship between the two countries, frequent meetings between the two leaders are not surprising, but the importance of holding the meeting at this time is undeniable. As for why officials were unwilling to announce it in advance, it was because the actions of the leaders of the two countries should not be known to the enemy. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>New York: A telegram from Rome said that according to the news released by Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece, Gaeta, Hitler and Mussolini discussed the situation in the United States at the meeting two days ago. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome: Yesterday, all the newspapers in the Italian Parliament praised the talks between Hitler and Mussolini as another expression of Axis solidarity, and the alliance between the two countries has entered a stage of closer cooperation. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome: A famous Italian journalist, Da, published an article in the "Italian Daily" yesterday, reviewing the background of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, and raised the following international issues: (1) Intensifying German air raids on Britain; (2) Strengthening Axis anti-blockade measures in the Atlantic; (3) Intensifying military operations in the Mediterranean; (4) Increasing US involvement in the war. He believed that there is no need to explain the themes discussed at the meeting and the matters already agreed upon. The facts of the future will be explained in due course. The meeting has once again proved that Germany and Italy have a consistent view and take joint action. The coordination between Germany and Italy has become a joint military action and a unified war goal to deal with common enemies. The main principle of combat is to choose the enemy's weaknesses and strike them hard. The Axis powers will strive for the initiative and cooperate to carry out this strategy extensively.

<h3 id="e27">Chaos Spreads in Romania, Plunging into Anarchy; Iron Guard Fights Street Battles with the Army; Rumor That Romanian Prime Minister Has Declared Military Dictatorship <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>London: The "Exchange Telegraph" reprinted a message from the capital of a southern country this morning, stating that the state of anarchy is spreading rapidly in the provinces of Romania. It is said that the Romanian economic situation is "completely chaotic." The Romanian army is seizing power from the Iron Guard everywhere. It is rumored that the Iron Guard has almost completely lost its power. At the same time, the London "Daily Telegraph" stated, "Berlin Radio said that General Antonescu has declared a military dictatorship and is trying to prevent the internal strife from sweeping the country." (International Telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Budapest: News from the Romanian capital says that the Iron Guard fascist military group and Prime Minister Antonescu's troops in the Romanian capital engaged in street battles yesterday. The telephone communication from Hungary to the Romanian capital has been cut off. It is reported that members of the Iron Guard have set up a coffin cart in a prominent location and are parading there, mourning the "Song of Hate." A report from a Turkish radio station heard in London said that the news received in Sofia yesterday was that communists in the Romanian capital attempted to overthrow the current regime on Monday, and many Germans were killed. Serious conflicts occurred everywhere, and the rebellion is continuing. For a while, the headlines of newspapers in Sofia called the chaos in the Romanian capital a "revolution," but the telegrams did not provide details. (Associated Press telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>London: The situation in Romania seems to be deteriorating, but the content of the messages transmitted from the Romanian capital to the outside world varies and is contradictory. Regular telephone and telegraph communications have been interrupted. According to the latest telegram from Sofia, the dictatorial Prime Minister Antonescu has lost control of the extremely serious situation. Since the dismissal of the Minister of the Interior, Petre Vicescu, the student legionnaires employed by the local governments have also been dismissed, but these students refuse to leave and have set up obstacles around them. The army ordered them to surrender, but was refused. Later, a thousand students armed with machine guns reinforced them. The police intervened, and two tanks were sent to suppress them. As a result of the conflict, the extremists won, and the military has withdrawn. There have been demonstrations in the streets, and students have formed a guard of honor, standing guard next to the corpses of their two comrades who were killed today. The Romanian Prime Minister has ordered the blockade of the Iron Guard headquarters "Green House" and various legion clubs, but obstacles have been set up in all of the above locations. The war is still going on. The Prime Minister has been unable to control the situation. The legion has been greatly expanded due to the inclusion of peasants and workers. The Romanian capital radio station was occupied by rebels on Tuesday afternoon, and their leader broadcast a request to remove the legion secretary, Liviu Georgescu, from his position. According to the New York Times report from the country's capital, Bucharest, a diplomat who had traveled from Romania to a neighboring country said that there had been demonstrations throughout Romania in the past 24 hours, with shootings and bombings, and several people had been killed. According to news from Sofia, hatred of the concentration of German troops in Romania and opposition to the Antonescu regime is growing, and the result may be a real struggle with the Nazis who are trying to restore order. Other reports say that the disturbance may be part of a right-wing coup, as confidants of the former King Carol are trying to overcome the power of the Germans and the pro-German Iron Guard. It is rumored that German troops have moved from Giurgiu to Bucharest and other places. According to a telegram from the capital of a southern country, the large-scale disturbance was launched by pro-German elements after the assassination of Colonel Dulin, and the result may require the German side to deal with it with strong measures. News telegrams from the capital of a southern country said that the Romanian army has seized power from the Iron Guard. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that confirmed news of a faction of Iron Guard members opposing the Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu having occupied several important buildings in the Romanian capital has now arrived here. These Iron Guard members were then driven out by the Romanian army. The Romanian Prime Minister seems to have a firm grip on the situation. Although it is not yet possible to confirm the reports that similar disturbances have also occurred in other provinces, they cannot be completely denied. As far as it is known here, the German side did not actively participate in this disturbance, but there is no reason to doubt that the Germans will convey requests, because it is obviously beneficial for them to take advantage of Romania's unrest to advance their economic and political interests in Romania. People here also pointed out that the unrest in Romania only began after Germany occupied the country. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>New York: A Columbia Broadcasting Company correspondent broadcasting from the capital of a southern country said that Bucharest has declared martial law since the failure of the Iron Guard coup, and the entire city is now completely under the control of the army. A curfew is in effect from 10 pm every night. According to news from Sofia, the Bulgarian border has been closed since Tuesday afternoon. (Reuters telegram from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to news here, last night the Romanian army and five hundred Iron Guard members engaged in a long and fierce battle in the center of the Romanian capital. Conflicts also occurred in other provincial cities, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Dozens of people were injured in the battle in the Romanian capital, and two Iron Guard members were killed. Two tanks and light machine guns participated in the battle. It is rumored that the Communist Party also participated in the battle. The battle was caused by the assassination of a German soldier by a Greek naturalized Romanian citizen on Monday. It is said that the Iron Guard launched a demonstration and rebelled when General Antonescu planned to separate them from the Volunteer Gendarmerie Corps. At the same time, the elite special guards surrounded the palace of young King Michael, the headquarters of the government ministries, and the German military delegation. The gendarmerie has occupied 87 industrial plants in Bucharest. Since the Romanian army and 500 Iron Guard members had a fierce battle last night, they have cleared the Iron Guard's police station. The Romanian army also occupied the Bucharest post office and took over all police forces. (International Telegraph from the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e36">The Immense British Military Expenditure <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>British military expenditure is increasing daily. This article is a report from the New York Times' London correspondent regarding the efforts of the British government and public to raise funds. It is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The British say they are willing to spend their last penny to achieve victory, and given the current situation, they seem very confident.</p>
<p>In the first year of the war, Britain spent an average of £5.3 million per day on war expenses. However, this was just the initial figure, and it has now increased to £10 million per day. Anyone familiar with wartime finance can imagine that in the next twelve months, the daily war expenses will reach a staggering £12.5 million.</p>
<p>Britain's current financial situation is different from that of the last European war. First, in the last European war, Britain's national debt was only £1 billion, but now it has reached £10 billion. Second, Britain needs at least £3.5 billion in war expenses each year. Comparing Britain and the United States, in 1940, the United States' expenditure totaled over $9.44 billion. With each pound sterling converted to four US dollars, Britain's expenditure exceeded the United States by more than $4.5 billion, demonstrating its immensity. The United States has a population of 131 million, while Britain has only 48 million. For such a small number of people to contribute such a huge amount of money will be an unprecedented record in the history of taxation.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, is not asking the people to contribute this sum in full. In terms of taxation, a married man with an annual income of £1,000 only needs to pay a strong £253 in income tax. Buying a set of clothes incurs a 12% tax, and buying a diamond ring or any luxury item incurs a strong 33% tax. The total amount of these taxes is only £1.5 billion, which is far from the amount needed for expenditure.</p>
<p>Of course, the British have other methods of raising funds. In total, within a year, the British people have raised £1.14 billion for the government through savings and subscriptions to public bonds, and £500 million has been raised through the sale of gold securities. However, Britain's expenditure still falls short by £360 million.</p>
<p>How will this shortfall be financed? Will it cause inflation? If Britain cannot obtain loans from the United States, will it be defeated? Will Britain follow Germany's policy of draining the pond to catch all the fish and continue to struggle? At this moment, no one dares to say for sure, but British economic experts are clearly willing to try all three methods soon.</p>
<p>Inflation has already been implemented to some extent, but its nature is not very serious. According to statistics, the funds raised purely through inflation amount to only £300 million. As for borrowing from the United States, British officials have always been cautious. They say that this is a legislative issue for the United States to decide. They acknowledge the need for American loans. Each time a German plane drops another bomb on Britain, and each time a German submarine launches another torpedo at Britain, the importance of American aid to Britain increases accordingly. Of the £800 million that the United States can lend to Britain, £500 million has already been used to buy British military supplies, and the war is still just beginning. The British government and public are now waiting for the United States to aid Britain through legal procedures, while also seeking other financial resources within the country.</p>
<p>When Britain is in financial difficulty, it often mentions that Germany's situation is far worse than Britain's, as a form of self-consolation. They estimate that Germany's war expenses require 4 billion marks per month, and the country's debt has reached 120 billion marks, with the debt increasing by an average of 25 billion marks per year. Germany previously had new markets for various industrial products in 1914, 1918, and 1933 to offset import payments, but now there are no new sources of wealth to draw upon, and the economic system of National Socialism is bound to reach its end.</p>
<p>While Britain is aware of Germany's weaknesses, it also acknowledges that Germany has aspects that can be learned from. For example, Germany increases production, strictly limits the consumption of daily necessities, and encourages people to return their savings to the state.</p>
<p>Britain does not have this system, and only relies on the voluntary savings of its citizens to achieve the same goal. Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has tried to reduce the production and sales of luxury goods, and has advised people to purchase goods to the minimum extent possible, so that the remainder can be contributed to the government. However, this method has not yet taken effect. The more money the workers in the arms factories earn, the greater their purchasing power. Although the middle class is cooperating closely with the government, the overall consumption of the country has not decreased significantly compared to peacetime. According to the statistics of an economic expert, it has only decreased by 5%.</p>
<p>This abnormal state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue and must be remedied with new methods. Therefore, in the future, taxes may continue to be increased, and some people advocate compulsory restrictions on consumption. Now that the American securities owned by wealthy Britons have been forcibly handed over to the government, the general public should also contribute a portion of their savings to the government. In the future, the goods in stores will no longer be as complete as they were last year. "More saving, less consumption" should be the creed of the British people in 1941.</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Soviet Union's Diplomatic Victories: Germany's Plan to Invade Greece Via Bulgaria, Abandoned Due to Soviet Opposition <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>New York: Diplomatic circles reported yesterday that Germany had originally obtained Bulgaria's permission to advance into Greece. Germany was forced to abandon this plan because it wanted to win the Soviet Union's signature on the Soviet-German economic agreement this month. According to these sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov held a secret meeting in Germany on January 6. The Bulgarian Prime Minister went to Germany for medical treatment. It is understood that Ribbentrop had obtained the Bulgarian Prime Minister's permission for German troops to pass through Bulgaria to Greece, but only with the consent of Southern countries and the Soviet Union. At that time, the German Foreign Minister guaranteed that he could "prepare everything." According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union strongly opposed this, because it firmly believed that no powerful foreign troops should exist in Bulgaria. The Soviet Union had long regarded Bulgaria as its only route to the Dardanelles. In order to induce the Soviet Union to sign a new trade agreement, Germany had to pay the price and cancel the Bulgarian plan. The Bulgarian government received the German agreement terms on January 11, which is evident from the Bulgarian Prime Minister's speech on January 12, which was welcomed by both Turkey and Greece. The sources also said that this is why the Soviet official TASS agency denied that the Soviet Union had agreed to German troops passing through Bulgaria. TASS's denial clearly tells the world that the Soviet Union still has a very important interest in the Balkans and allows it in Bulgaria. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: After the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister issued declarations in the Diet yesterday, the House of Representatives focused on discussing a resolution to consolidate the wartime organization this afternoon and unanimously passed it. However, the debate on government policies, which was intended as a prelude to the discussion of next year's budget tomorrow, was not carried out. According to the resolution, which was approved by Diet members yesterday and submitted to the plenary session of the House of Representatives today, it reads: "In view of the increasingly tense international situation, and our country's pursuit of maintaining world peace, we are determined to destroy all attempts to infringe upon our sphere of life. This situation requires us to consolidate our wartime organization as soon as possible. Therefore, it is resolved that all government policies and administrative plans should be focused on achieving this goal, and the Diet should strive to support the government so that the whole country can move forward bravely to cope with the emergency situation." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: "Asahi Shimbun" reported today that the Lower House has decided to abandon general questioning, which is an unprecedented move in the 50-year history of the Diet. The Lower House's abandonment of questioning indicates unconditional support for the government, to help the government overcome unprecedented difficulties. However, the real reason for this move is the pressure from the government's so-called "new national structure." This new movement, which tends towards the system of totalitarian states, has led to the demise of political parties last year. It also stated that the government, in order to express its appreciation for the cooperation of the Lower House, will not submit the election bill or other bills to the House for review, and will try to pass the budget as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e40">China's Conscription System Is More Perfect Than Before; Sufficient Reserves, Reduced Conscription Quota; New System Holds Four Lotteries Each Year <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: It is appropriate to declare here today that China's conscription system has undergone considerable changes after four years of experience. The original system has been improved, and it is believed that the new system can reduce the difficulties felt by the people on the one hand. The original lottery for enlistment was held monthly, but it has now been changed to be held four times a year in March, June, September, and December. Military authorities say that China has sufficient reserves, so even if the conscription quota is reduced, it will not affect the replenishment process. At the same time, people who volunteer for enlistment are also encouraged, as in the past. The treatment received by new recruits and their families is also better than in the past. Farmers and professionals are exempt from military service. They raise funds for this purpose. Farmers donate rice and other food in place of cash, while professionals and craftsmen donate cash. Half of the funds and rice donated are supplied to the families of new recruits to avoid them being left unattended, and the other half is used for uniforms and bedding for new recruits. Special attention is now being paid to preventing those who evade military service by bribery or other illegal means, so the authorities feel that the operation of the system is now more effective than before.

<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources here, the Chinese authorities have reached an agreement with the special envoys of the Burmese government, who have been staying in Chongqing for several weeks, on a plan to build several important transportation lines between China, Burma, and India. The plan includes (1) the construction of the planned Yunnan-Burma Railway, from Dali to Lashio; (2) the opening of the highway from China to India; and (3) the establishment of China-India aviation. In addition, the Burmese envoys also discussed important commercial matters with the Chinese government. It is reported that the Chinese government has already begun construction of the Dali to Kunming section of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which accounts for one-third of the entire line. Dali is located in northwestern Yunnan and is a famous production area of marble. The section of the Yunnan-Burma Railway from Dali to Lashio crosses the Mekong River and the Nu River, with many mountains, and construction will be quite difficult. The railway is roughly parallel to the Yunnan-Burma Highway. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Taxpaying Foreigners Held a Meeting Today; Chinese and Foreign Citizens All Attach Importance; The Outcome of the Tax Increase Plan Relates to the Burden on Citizens; The Municipal Council Again Explained the Actual Situation of Revenue and Expenditure Yesterday <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council, due to financial difficulties, large and small, convened a special meeting of taxpaying foreigners to request the passage of increased taxes and license fees. The meeting was scheduled to be held today at 2:30 PM on the grandstand of the Racecourse. The chairman of the meeting has been internally designated as Mr. Hill, the Danish Consul-General and Senior Consul in Shanghai. The agenda is: (1) Election of the Secretary of the Meeting; (2) Request for passage of increases in (A) land tax; (B) a 40% surcharge on the General Municipal Rate; (C) a 40% surcharge on the Special Property Rate; (3) Request for authorization for the Municipal Council to increase various license fees from January 1st until the next Taxpayers' Annual Meeting. However, Japanese residents have proposed a motion to overturn the entire plan. British and American residents seem to support the Municipal Council's tax increase. Therefore, not only will there be fierce debate at the meeting, but it has also been decided that a final vote will be taken by all taxpaying foreigners by a show of hands.</p>
<p>Re-Publication of Revenue and Expenditure Overview</p>
<p>The Municipal Council re-published an overview of revenue and expenditure, saying, "The Special Meeting of Taxpaying Foreigners is about to be held. The revenue, expenditure, and deficit situation of the Council have been explained in detail in previous articles. Now, we will re-select the main points to inform all taxpayers.</p>
<p>Deficit Situation</p>
<p>The Council's regular expenditure last year exceeded the budget by 7.8 million yuan. Regular revenue increased by 4.6 million yuan compared to the projected amount. The total annual deficit is estimated to be around 8.773 million yuan (the original budget listed more than 5.573 million yuan). In December last year, the issuance of cost-of-living allowances to all employees was approved, requiring 1 million yuan per month, of which 714,000 yuan was added to Chinese employees who did not have employment contracts. If the Council's revenue and expenditure situation continues like this, the deficit for this year will be 20 million yuan. If the tax increase is delayed until April, the amount of the increase should be around 60% instead of 40%.</p>
<p>Revenue from Tax Increase</p>
<p>If the general rate and land rate are collected at 1%, 400,000 yuan can be obtained annually. Collected at the current rate of 27%, 37.8 million yuan can be obtained annually. If the surcharge is increased by 40%, the annual revenue is expected to increase by 15.12 million yuan. In addition, after the revision of various license fees, it is expected to increase revenue by 3.5 million yuan annually. After deducting these two items to offset the estimated deficit, there is a shortfall of 1.4 million yuan, which is planned to be made up by increasing the assessed value of owner-occupied houses.</p>
<p>Expected Fierce Debate</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News said, "The Special Meeting of Taxpaying Foreigners in the Public Concession is scheduled to be held on the 23rd (today) afternoon at the Race Club. The Municipal Council must increase tax revenue by 20 million yuan to meet its financial needs for 1941. However, taxpaying Japanese expect the Municipal Council to be more frugal and to revise the current tax system of the Public Concession. Therefore, the meeting will clearly have the most intense debate in the history of the Public Concession. In addition to the important proposals submitted to taxpayers for discussion at the meeting, it is expected that other important changes that may be proposed at the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting in April can be foreseen, such as taxpaying Japanese planning to change the election system, and even amend the Land Regulations, etc."</p>
<p>Japanese Amendment of the Tax System</p>
<p>What will be discussed at the meeting is the "Resolution No. [Blank]" proposed by Mr. Catty and seconded by Mr. Carly, which requests taxpayers to approve a 40% surcharge on land tax, a 27% municipal general rate, a 24% special rate, and the continued increase in license fees proposed by the Municipal Council's Economic Committee. Taxpaying Japanese oppose this proposal and have passed an amendment requesting the Municipal Council to "be more frugal and fundamentally study the possibility of revising the current tax system in order to apply a more equitable system." It is expected that many taxpayers from other countries will support the Japanese amendment.</p>
<p>Borrowing to Make Up the Deficit Is a Stopgap</p>
<p>Although the amendment advocates that the Municipal Council make up the estimated shortfall of less than 20 million yuan by borrowing, pending the revision of the tax system, some people believe that this method is quite difficult, because the Municipal Council's financial situation requires immediate and practical steps. British taxpayers have also passed an amendment advocating the temporary increase of a 40% surcharge on owner-occupied houses from January 1st of this year, pending a new and accurate assessment. The surcharge on rented properties is limited to 40% of the 1937 assessment.</p>

At the same time, each bank and company will issue its own public notice to inform the public.</p>
<p>Market Closure Dates</p>
<p>Due to the approach of the year-end closing period, various industry markets have decided to close the market during the year-end closing period to handle annual accounting. Reporters from the New Voice News Agency inquired about the market conditions of various industries yesterday: (1) The money market's discount interest rate will be opened until the 25th, and the market will open on January 31st; (2) The foreign exchange black market will be closed from the afternoon of the 25th, and the market will open on the 30th; (3) The public bond gray market will be closed from the afternoon of the 22nd, and the market will open on January 31st; (4) After the trading on the morning of the 22nd, the yarn and cotton gray market will handle settlement and close the market, and the market will open on January 31st; (5) The gold black market is scheduled to close from the afternoon of the 25th; (6) The miscellaneous grains market will be closed on the 22nd, and the bean and rice market will be closed on the 23rd.</p>

<p>In addition to handling the year-end closing, all money shops must completely repay all credit transactions and overdrafts before New Year's Eve, and return the transaction books, in accordance with past customs. After the year-end closing period, transaction books will be sent separately for transactions. However, the deposit interest of various factories, companies, and firms will be settled up to January 20th. The interest on deposits and debts of various banks will be calculated as usual. It is heard that the banks will open on January 30th, and the money shops will open on January 31st (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year) due to the connection with the God of Wealth. There will be six new money shops opening, one closing, and one suspending its listing.</p>

<p>After the "Central Reserve Bank" of the puppet regime opened a branch in Shanghai, it was rumored the day before yesterday that the Jianghai Customs had transferred 500,000 yuan in gold bars seized and confiscated on the Shengjing Wheel to the "Bank", and it was also rumored that all goods and fines confiscated by the Jianghai Customs thereafter would be transferred to the Bank. According to the English-language North China Daily News, Customs Commissioner Raufford said yesterday that this news is not true and that the Customs has not transferred the gold bars and other confiscated smuggled goods and fines to the Bank.</p>

<p>Utility prices in this city have risen time and again since the war, exceeding pre-war levels by several times. The general public is nearly overwhelmed by the burden. However, various utility companies invariably use the excuse of foreign exchange shortages and soaring expenses, completely disregarding the interests of the public. This is truly distressing.</p>
<p>Public Concession - Increased Electricity Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession announced another price increase starting February 1st. The electricity surcharge will increase to 180.97%, while ordinary electricity for power, heating, cooking, and water heating will increase by 276.37%.

<p>Since the declaration of war between Britain and Germany, British ships on the Europe-Asia route have gradually decreased. The British India Steam Navigation Company in this city is the largest organization in the British shipping industry in the Far East. The Shanghai-London line, which originally had three ships per month, has had no sailings from Shanghai to England for more than two months. Only the India and Australia lines are still maintained as usual, but the number of ships has also decreased.</p>
<p>The Ellora (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai from Bombay, India, loaded with a large quantity of cotton, over 80,000 pieces. It is said that the ship has also been requisitioned by the British Navy. Therefore, it is scheduled to return to India from Shanghai tomorrow (24th). After unloading its cargo in Calcutta, it will be handed over to the British Navy for deployment. Regular ships on the Shanghai-London route have been suspended. Irregular ships include cargo ships from the Blue Funnel Line. The Eurasia Line of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has also been greatly reduced. It is said that most of the Norwegian ships managed by the company have been requisitioned by the British Navy. Now a few ships are maintaining the Pacific route. As for the Canadian Pacific mail ships on the Pacific route, the British China Navigation Company can be said to be the sole operator. The company has four Empress mail ships, which are large and luxuriously equipped, and are famous mail ships on the Pacific route. They have now all been requisitioned for military use. According to the company, there are no ships available temporarily, and ships may be available in April. Another source says that the Blue Funnel Line plans to send ships to the Shanghai-Canada route and is currently planning.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, according to a letter from a foreign priest of the church in Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, Japanese planes have been constantly flying to the area for bombing. Many church buildings have also been deliberately bombed and destroyed. However, church work continues as usual. Recently, Japanese planes intentionally bombed church property. The letter reports two unfortunate incidents, which are excerpted below. Due to frequent air raid alarms and heavy bombing, we deeply feel that the war has occurred. Since the church building was bombed, we feel that the war is already in progress. On the 15th of last month, the church's orphanage and the residence of the nuns were suddenly bombed by three Japanese seaplanes, and machine-gunned. There are a total of 500 orphans and priests in the institute, one of whom has been killed and another injured.</p>

<p>Since the assassination of Mr. Doug, legal advisor of the French Municipal Council and chairman of the French Concession Rent Committee, all matters related to the rent investigation in the French Concession have been suspended. In December of last year, the committee drafted regulations to crack down on housing speculation and submitted them to the French Consul-General for review and implementation. As the chairman of the Rent Committee has not yet been selected, all procedures could not be completed. Yesterday, a spokesman for the French Municipal Council said that Mr. Doug's vacancy has not yet been filled, and added that the various affairs of the legal department of the Municipal Council are progressing smoothly. A candidate will be determined in the near future.</p>

<p>The French Police Force originally followed the custom of taking three days off during the Spring Festival to suspend work. The Spring Festival this year will be on holiday as usual. However, on the "January 28th" Memorial Day, although it is during the holidays, the French Police Force must still work, and all police officers must also serve as usual to strengthen police force and ensure security.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Municipal Council Board of Directors Passes Adjustment of Treatment for Chinese Staff, Appointment Letters Issued to Chinese Professionals, Pensions Limited to Those Holding Appointment Letters <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The "Research Staff Service Conditions" subcommittee of the Municipal Council's Economic Committee has been in place for four months. Its task is to study whether there are any changes that can be made to the current staff service conditions. After review, a report has been prepared and submitted to the Council Board of Directors for approval at the regular meeting on the 22nd of this month. The recommendations in the report include the following:</p>
<p>Chinese Staff - Adjust Treatment</p>
<p>(1) Please have the Classification Committee consider (A) adjusting the year-end bonus and funeral expenses for Chinese staff holding appointment letters, (B) expanding the medical benefits enjoyed by senior Chinese staff who do not hold appointment letters, and (C) issuing appointment letters to more Chinese staff with specialized or technical qualifications. (2) The Chinese Staff Association's request to extend the pension plan to all Chinese staff is not approved. Currently, the above plan is limited to Chinese staff holding appointment letters.</p>
<p>Chinese Clerks Set Up - Extra Grade</p>
<p>(3) According to the current method, the salary of a first-class Chinese clerk can automatically increase from 92 yuan to 207 yuan, which is too far apart. This committee agrees to add an extra grade with a salary of 150 yuan. After that, when promoted from the extra grade to the top grade, it should be the same as the current promotion from the third grade to the second grade and from the second grade to the first grade. The promotion shall be effective only after being recommended by the superior.</p>
<p>Savings Plan - Also Changed</p>
<p>(4) Chinese field staff with a salary of 50 yuan or more may freely join the savings plan. (5) For staff employed by the Municipal Council in the future, their savings must be deposited for five years before they can enjoy the Municipal Council's subsidy when they terminate their employment. (6) In the future, staff who resign after accumulating savings for more than six years and whose total deposits are not guaranteed by any exchange subsidies should be given a cash subsidy by the Municipal Council when the savings are to be withdrawn to supplement them. This subsidy is calculated as a percentage, equal to the amount of their living expenses subsidy on the date of their resignation. (7) The above current subsidy does not apply to retired staff prior to the implementation of this method. In the future, when the exchange rate is 6 pence in British gold, 0.61642 in US dollars, or 0.5733 in Japanese yen, this subsidy will be considered in the east line. (8) The Classification Committee should consider approving the special leave plan for senior Chinese staff.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese naval authorities announced the expansion of the coastal blockade to the Guangdong-South China Sea area, foreign merchant ships sailing to coastal ports have been repeatedly intercepted and detained. According to shipping industry news yesterday, the Panama-registered giant cargo ship Marion has recently been detained by Japanese warships encountered en route. All Chinese crew members have been released, but the ship and the Norwegian shipowner have been forced to sail to Taiwan. The Norwegian Consulate General has been reported and has filed a protest with the Japanese through the Norwegian Consul in Hong Kong. The Portuguese ship Anjo (S.S. Anjo) is also currently being detained by the Japanese.</p>

<p>The barbed wire obstacles set up by the Japanese in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area have been moved recently. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the blockade obstacles near Hong En Hospital on Great West Road and at the intersection of Rue Amiral Courbet and Great West Road were removed by Japanese soldiers on the 21st of this month, making it easier for pedestrians and vehicles to enter and exit. However, a barbed wire fence has been erected near the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour and Hai Ge Road, and vehicles and pedestrians must detour through the gap to pass. Rickshaws are not allowed to pass and must detour elsewhere. The densely arranged barbed wire is newly made, or will be placed for a long time, blocking traffic.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Gold Travels to Chongqing, Record of Interview with Chairman Chiang <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Gold, the editor of the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, recently traveled to Chongqing and wrote an account of his interview with Chairman Chiang. The original text is omitted. Now there is one person who has the absolute loyalty and obedience of one-quarter of the world's people, namely Chairman Chiang, the leader of Free China. After the Chinese army suffered through a war and a half, Japan finally realized that peace could only be achieved with the consent of Chairman Chiang. The reporter has met Chairman Chiang several times, and now he has met someone falsely called a "warlord dictator," and sees his breadth of mind, which is progressing with each day, and has become a model of democracy and a great man.</p>
<p>Deeper Belief in Final Victory</p>
<p>Everyone who has met with Chairman Chiang unanimously believes in the final victory of an independent China and that Chairman Chiang is crucial to building China along the lines of free democracy. His attitude is firm, and his belief is deeper than ever before. Chairman Chiang has the demeanor of an ancient gentleman, but reveals his inner vitality and decisiveness everywhere. He met the reporter in the living room of his private residence, which had been repeatedly bombed but had not been hit, wearing a simple khaki military uniform, with sharp and kind eyes, and a smile on his face. He warmly shook hands and invited the reporter to sit down upon entering the hall.</p>
<p>Earnestly Concerned About the People of Shanghai</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang first inquired anxiously about the people and situation of the "isolated island" of Shanghai. The reporter replied that Shanghai was very different from Chongqing. Chairman Chiang continued: "We are all very grateful for the friendly attitude expressed by American commercial publications and American expatriates in China. We are aware that you are encountering difficulties because of your independent position, and we feel that you have shown great courage in upholding what you believe is just, and publishing news and editorials without fear of violence." Chairman Chiang then inquired about the welfare of other American expatriates who were "wanted," saying that rumors had it that one American expatriate was living in Hongkou. The reporter told him that this was not the case. Chairman Chiang expressed satisfaction and instructed the reporter to ask the American expatriate to take care of himself. Chairman Chiang was deeply concerned about the people of Shanghai, saying that he was convinced that the people of Shanghai and other parts of the country were all deeply patriotic and hoped that the reporter would convey to the people the belief that China had already endured the most suffering and was about to see better times.</p>
<p>China has Entered the Democratic Camp</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang then discussed the future of China after the war and other broad issues. From Chairman Chiang down, all are deeply convinced that China will win the war, and there is no doubt that Japan will ultimately be destroyed after suffering a bitter war with China. Some people ask whether China's development will be hindered by "dictatorship," but they do not know that Chairman Chiang is strongly opposed to totalitarianism. It is said that "the Chinese people are inherently democratic, China has entered the democratic camp, China had already chosen this path before the war, and will insist on it until the end of the war, and will continue to follow the democratic path in the future."</p>
<p>American Ambassador Johnson Expresses his Views</p>
<p>Regarding this point, the reporter has consulted with various people and obtained various answers. For example, American Ambassador Johnson said, "China is in the midst of a revolution and has suddenly encountered war. However, when the war ends, the continuation of the revolutionary trend is inevitable. Looking at the overall event from a historical perspective, he feels that outsiders are impatient with China because it does not quickly seek solutions that satisfy the psychology of Westerners! China must find its own path and gradually move forward."</p>
<p>Constitution Implemented After the War Ends</p>
<p>The reporter also asked Chairman Chiang whether the National Political Council was a very important signpost on the path to democracy in the future. He replied that this was a temporary measure. After the war ends, we will fully implement the new constitution of free democracy and follow the precedents of the United States and other major democracies to accommodate multiple parties to replace the current one-party system. A parliament will be convened, and a general election will be held to implement the entire democratic system. The United States is the greatest democratic country, and China will follow the example of the United States to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Pawnshops Should be Insured According to Capital <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The pawnshop industry can regulate the finances of ordinary people, increase local production, and is closely related to social welfare. However, pawnshops in various places are mostly privately run, with short terms and high profits, and are rife with abuses. They may even stop operating at will, affecting social stability. In view of this, the Ministry of the Interior has drafted and promulgated management measures. The measures stipulate that all pawnshops should be insured with an insurance company according to the total amount of capital within one month after opening. Those who violate the regulations may be ordered by the provincial and municipal governments to suspend their business, except for those who have obtained approval from the provincial and municipal governments due to traffic congestion. If pawnshops encounter losses of pawned items due to war, robbery, or water and fire disasters, they should report to the competent authorities and the local chamber of commerce within 24 hours after the incident to verify and seal the remaining items. Those who have insured with an insurance company must notify the insurance company to send personnel to inspect and seal the items together. Those with recognizable serial numbers should be redeemed as before. Those without verifiable serial numbers should be valued and sold, and the original pawned households should be paid at half price according to the face value of the pawn tickets, and 60% of the face value should be compensated. If the foregoing provisions are violated, in addition to a fine of more than 500 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan, they will still be ordered to handle the matter in accordance with the previous provisions.</p>

<p>Kang Shoufan, the young owner of the Guohua Cotton Mill on Youheng Road and a Ningbo native, lived at No. 14 Tongfuli, Jing'an Temple Road. At 9:10 am on December 12 last year, he took his own car No. 1666 to the factory to handle business. Just as he had not yet gotten out of the car at the factory gate, a number of bandits surrounded him, pulled out pistols, threatened him, and kidnapped him to Jiading, demanding ransom. Later, the family</p>
<p>Paid Ransom to Redeem</p>
<p>Him. After returning home, Wang Yongjun, a detective from the Putuo Road Police Station, learned that the kidnappers in the case, Cai Asi and Ma Guoliang from Pudong, often went to the Yong'an Company rooftop ice rink on Nanjing Road to skate for entertainment, disguised as wealthy young men, wearing leather shoes and coats, and spending money like water. At about 2:00 pm on the 9th of this month, Detective Wang, along with Captain Feng Baishun, Detective Pi Shaozhang, and West Detective Tierte Deng, secretly went to the ice rink and arrested Cai and Ma.</p>
<p>Two People Arrested</p>
<p>And escorted them to the First Special Court. The victim was ill and did not arrive, and the court hearing was postponed. The two defendants were remanded. During the postponement, Detective Wang, who was in charge of the case, found out that the leader of the gangsters, surnamed Ye, was hiding at a certain number in Yunxiafang, Beile Road in the French Concession. He secretly went with a police officer from the French Concession to arrest him at the address, but Ye was well-informed and had already fled. Yesterday morning, the police sent the two criminals Cai and Ma to the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution according to Article 347 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Kidnapping for Ransom</p>
<p>He stated that Kang Shoufan, the victim in the case, had been verified by police detectives that his family had paid 40,000 yuan to redeem him after the incident, and that he was currently recuperating in the hospital because he was too frightened at the time and his mind had not yet recovered. There was a letter in his own handwriting stating the circumstances of the kidnapping at the time and the words escaping from the bandit den by taking advantage of the opportunity. The defendant Cai Asi confessed that</p>
<p>He was a Car Driver</p>
<p>At the time, he was invited by Meng Amao, who was at large, to Tangshan Inn on Tangshan Road, and was forced to commit the kidnapping. At that time, the victim's driver was driven away, and I drove the car to Jiading. The rest of the confessions were vague. Ma Guoliang confessed that Cai Asi had asked him to wait in a small teahouse in Jiading that day, denying that he had admitted that he was looking out near Dongyouheng Gongping Road at the time. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded and the hearing was postponed to summon the victim to verify the facts.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Starting From Oneself <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Daling</p>
<p>Shen Daling lectured on "Starting From Oneself" at the eighth session of the Five Teachings Sutra Meeting, which was attended by followers of all five religions.</p>
<p>The Doctrine of the Mean in the Book of Rites says that sincerity is self-completing, and the Way is self-led. The Great Learning speaks of not deceiving oneself, and speaking of self-illumination. Only after possessing something within oneself can one demand it of others; only after not possessing something within oneself can one criticize it in others. The Analects say, "I have not yet seen anyone who can see his own faults and inwardly accuse himself." Benevolence originates from oneself, and one should be ashamed of one's actions. Ancient scholars cultivated themselves, cultivating themselves with reverence, cultivating themselves to bring peace to others, and cultivating themselves to bring peace to the common people. The gentleman seeks within himself. Mencius said that if one examines oneself and does not find sincerity, one should be uneasy; if one examines oneself and finds sincerity, there is no misfortune or blessing that one does not seek from oneself, quoting the poem "Seek for yourself many blessings," and quoting the Tai Jia "One who makes his own evil cannot live." He also said that having these four beginnings (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom) and thinking oneself capable is to harm oneself. If one's actions are not successful, one should always examine oneself. People must first insult themselves before others insult them; a family must first destroy itself before others destroy it; a country must first attack itself before others attack it. One who abandons himself cannot be reasoned with, and one who isolates himself cannot be worked with. Speaking contrary to propriety and righteousness is called abandoning oneself; being unable to abide in benevolence and follow righteousness is called discarding oneself. The gentleman delves deeply into the Way, desiring to attain it for himself. The gentleman must reflect on himself. Confucian books emphasize oneself with meticulous and detailed explanations.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu, in chapter thirty-three, says that one who knows himself is enlightened, and one who overcomes himself is strong. Zhuang Tzu's Treatise on Equalizing Things says that knowing oneself is knowing. In the Human World, the ultimate person of ancient times first existed within himself and then existed within others. If even the virtue of Ji Zi is insufficient to reflect on oneself, then in the Great Ancestral Master, adapting to others but not adapting oneself, those who cannot untangle themselves are bound by things.</p>
<p>Buddhist scriptures speak of self-nature, self-liberation, self-realization, and self-practice for the transformation of others, also known as self-benefit and benefiting others. All dharmas have unchanging natures, called self-nature. Self-liberation means first liberating oneself, crossing the sea of life and death to reach the shore of Nirvana. The ultimate truth, not obtained from others but self-realized, is called self-realization. Seeking Bodhi above is self-benefit, and transforming sentient beings below is benefiting others. The practices of Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas are only for self-benefit, while the practices of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are for both self-benefit and benefiting others. This path, like Confucianism, also emphasizes oneself.</p>
<p>The Old Testament of Christianity, Jeremiah chapter forty-eight, Moab is punished for being arrogant and conceited. Chapter forty-nine, Edom is punished for being deceived by the pride of his heart. Lamentations of Jeremiah, why do the living complain when punished for their sins? We should deeply examine our own actions. Ezekiel chapter eighteen, the good deeds of the righteous will return to themselves, and the evil deeds of the wicked will also return to themselves. Hosea chapter ten, sow righteousness for yourselves, and you will reap love. Zephaniah chapter three, but you rise early and corrupt yourselves in everything. Haggai chapter one, consider your own ways.</p>
<p>The Quran says, "Now We have shown the warning, may they reflect on themselves." Evil people do not reflect on their own faults. They are willing to abandon themselves; this is truly a sin of their own making. Why do you not reflect on yourselves? The calamity that the rebellious bring upon themselves will surely come. Those who do good benefit themselves, and those who do evil harm themselves. Your calamities are caused by your own actions, harming yourselves and your families. If calamities befall you, it is because you have brought them upon yourselves. The righteous will surely have good rewards; seek light for yourselves. They truly take the blame upon themselves, performing almsgiving widely for themselves; this is the highest good. Those who are stingy with themselves will surely prosper later. Each person knows what they are doing. This, like Christianity, also emphasizes oneself.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is most important for everyone to know themselves. On the one hand, encouraging oneself is active, and on the other hand, warning oneself is passive. I hope to encourage all of you with the shared emphasis on oneself in the five religions.</p>

<p>News from the society: Yao Shuijuan, the Yue Opera queen currently performing at the Cathay Theatre, was suddenly pelted with manure when she exited the Zhejiang East Grand Theatre on Beijing Road, Songjia Lane, after finishing a performance the day before. The normally fragrant and powdered Yao Shuijuan was instantly covered in yellow liquid, unrecognizable. Furthermore, Zhou Yunsong, a local fellow villager of 72 years old and a real estate merchant residing at No. 13, Lane 57, Panxin Road, French Concession, was going out on business at 2 PM on the 18th of this month when, just as he stepped out of his front door, he was unexpectedly met by Jin Rongfa (25 years old), a Shanghai native and typist at the French Public Works Bureau residing at No. 1 next door, who threw a bag of excrement at his face. His head, face, and hat were completely covered in urine and feces, and the stench was unbearable. Jin, seeing that he had achieved his goal, immediately turned and fled. Zhou, due to his old age and weakness, was unable to chase him and returned home to wash himself. Afterwards, he reported the incident to the French police station, requesting an investigation and arrest. Jin avoided returning home after the incident until the afternoon of the day before, when he secretly returned and was discovered by French police detective Xia Songhai, who arrested Jin. During interrogation, Jin admitted to throwing manure out of spite. The police chief ordered Jin to be detained pending further investigation. It is rumored that Jin's family has hired someone to mediate, apologize, and seek reconciliation with Zhou.</p>

<h3 id="e70">### Letter <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read an article in your newspaper about the telephone company, and the part about Chunrong is inconsistent with the facts. Chunrong, although in the electrical materials business, is not a repairman for the telephone company. This case is completely unrelated. However, because he purchased lead-covered telephone wire from Xiangtai Foreign Firm two years ago and still has some stock for sale, a customer with the surname Xu caused a slight suspicion. However, after investigation by the Central Police Station, it was clarified and he was not prosecuted. He was legally released by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. The report in your newspaper is likely based on inaccurate rumors. This concerns Chunrong's reputation, so I cannot remain silent. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper promptly correct the record as soon as possible. Respectfully yours, Gao Chunrong, January 22nd.</p>

<h3 id="e72">### Finance: Hong Kong Side Backfills Sterling <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the unofficial English and American exchange markets, the fluctuations were minor due to inconsistent actions among operators, with a slight tendency towards tightening. There were many rumors in the market, such as news that the Roosevelt conference had mentioned the freezing of Axis funds, and news that Anglo-Japanese relations were strained. All of these were bearish factors. Speculators in the market sold off, but suddenly the Hong Kong side came to backfill shorts (some say they sold gold). They strongly bought sterling, and some Western brokers organized hedge funds to absorb U.S. dollars, competing with other speculators. It was heard that brokerage firms had cheaply settled February U.S. dollars at 5.40625 yuan, but closing spot U.S. dollars at 5.4375 yuan were difficult to buy. As a result, English exchange was 3 pence 40625, and the U.S. exchange was 5.40625 yuan, with little change from the previous day. The same was true for futures.</p>
<p>Both English and American Currencies Unchanged</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's large lots, both near and forward, fell by 0.0625. New York's silver price was flat, and London's raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate of English to American was flat, and to Shanghai it increased by 0.0625. The exchange rate of American to English was tighter, and to Shanghai it decreased by one point. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with English gold at 3 pence 40625 and U.S. dollars at 5.40625 yuan, the same as the previous day's close. It was heard that the market was quiet afterwards. It was estimated that foreign banks first traded this month's U.S. dollar price at 5.40625 yuan. Soon, Hong Kong Electric came to buy sterling, with Chinese and foreign firms offering this month's prices at 3 pence 40625 and 390625. The price for February was 3 pence 375. At 9:30, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was lower by 0.50. After that, there were bearish rumors in the market, and speculators sold off a large number of U.S. dollars, but at the same time, Hong Kong Electric absorbed them aggressively, so supply and demand were balanced. It was estimated that speculators, American firms, and Hong Kong Lei traded this month's U.S. dollars at 5.4375 yuan. Later, because foreign firms supplied heavily, the market became slightly tighter. It was estimated that brokers bought this month's U.S. dollars from foreign firms at 5.4375 yuan, and February U.S. dollars reached 5.40625 yuan. The noon closing was stable, and the U.S. dollar softened. As a result, spot and this month's English gold were 3 pence 40625, U.S. dollars were 5.40625 yuan, and next month's English gold was 3 pence 375, U.S. dollars were 5.375 yuan. Compared to the previous day's closing price, there were no gains or losses for English and American exchange rates, either spot or futures.</p>
<h3 id="e73">### Hong Kong Currency in High Demand <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the Chariot market rise and fall. English and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. The English gold notes remained fixed as before, and the market price stabilized. American gold notes initially rose to 18.42 yuan, but finally settled at 18.2 yuan, falling by 0.18 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes were in high demand, and the market price rose. Japanese gold notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price stabilized, remaining at 1.57 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes had slightly stronger supply, and the market price weakened, falling to 1.2 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e74">### International Situation Unfavorable for Bullishness, Gold Market Declines Again <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chariot market saw a decline from high levels, with a widespread sense of fatigue. The opening price was the highest, following the previous day's rise, initially reaching 6,750 yuan. However, reports stated that the United Kingdom would withdraw its merchants residing in Japan, and it was further rumored that Japanese ships were no longer allowed to approach Singapore. The rumor that the United States would freeze Axis funds resurfaced, and there were reports of exchange dealers organizing companies to sell short, and that the Hong Kong gang was also selling short. The middle price of Dafeng, Xinfeng, Hesheng, and Hengji cash shops fell to a low of 6,610 yuan. Near noon, there was news that Xinyuan was dumping more than 4,000 taels, and the Shanghai Western gang was covering long positions, so the price rebounded, finally reaching 6,650 yuan, down 73 yuan. Based on the February U.S. dollar settlement price of 5.375 yuan, it was 6,500 yuan, an increase of 150 yuan. Total transaction volume for half a day was approximately 10,000 taels, with approximately 400 taels of spot contracts transferring from January to February. Yuxing, Yongdeng, and others offered 225 yuan, while Xinyuan alone offered to buy. For cash, Baokang sold 200 taels to Dadecheng, with the price 10 yuan lower than the futures price. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday, and ornaments were also listed at 10 yuan lower, at 680 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat. Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) saw enthusiastic buying, following the previous day's trend. The market opened at 9:15 and immediately rose to 6,750 yuan, 27 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Hesheng Dafeng came to sell, and Xinyuan, No. 3, also sold, which attracted attention, and followers sold off, causing the price to gradually drop by 85 yuan, returning to 6,700 yuan and then falling to 6,665 yuan. Later, Yuxing, Yongxiang, and Hefu covered shorts, and Shunyuan also bought. It was decided yesterday to reach 6,705 yuan. Eventually, due to the softening of foreign exchange and rumors of friction between England and Japan, such as Singapore banning Japanese merchant ships from entering and England withdrawing its nationals from Japan, and the US having stipulations for freezing the funds of Axis nations, market sentiment turned bearish. Hengji, Dafeng, and cash shops sold together, and prices dropped to the 6,600-yuan mark, reaching a low of 6,610 yuan. Thereafter, Xinyuan and the Shanghai West gang were active on the dips and aggressively sought to buy, pushing the price up to 6,655 yuan, and eventually closed at 6,650 yuan, down 73 yuan from the previous day. The range was 140 yuan in half a day. The cash shop's basic gold selling price was more than 10 yuan higher than the Chariot market, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current marked gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Transactions were done openly.</p>
<p>Ornament Prices Also Listed 10 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments was 10 yuan lower per tael, with Datongheng, Xinhengheng, and others listing 680 yuan. The buying price of Xinhengheng was similar to the listed price, 30 yuan lower, it was said.</p>

<p>This month's 26th (Sunday) is the final settlement period for the 19th year of the lunar cycle. The city's silver and money industry association has decided that, to facilitate collection and settlement for all businesses, business will be conducted as usual on Saturday afternoon the 25th and on Sunday the following day. However, the four Chinese banks, namely Huaqiao, Zhongyu, Dongya, and Guangdong, as well as all foreign commercial banks in the city, will be closed as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e76">### Securities: Domestic Debt Near an End; Trading Remains Active Yesterday, Market Fluctuations Large <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The domestic debt market was nearing its end yesterday. From the afternoon onwards, the market closed early and will not reopen until January 31 (i.e., the fifth day of the lunar new year). Due to the previous day's drop, and the unevenness of the drop, the market situation was fluctuating greatly, with large volumes and a spread of one yuan or several jiao. The main factors affecting market sentiment were the last settlement before the new year, the settlement between bulls and bears, and the unsettled rumors about interest rates. The most notable event was that Tongkang continued to buy aggressively for several consecutive days. During the closing, there was an unexpected trend. Trading in the morning half-day remained extremely active. Tongkang first bought aggressively, continuously raising the price by 1.5 yuan. Then, as sellers continued to emerge, Xinfu, Dahua, and Xieda sold in large quantities, causing a slight pullback. Then, Tongsheng, Hengfu, Runli, and Renchang bought again, raising the price by another 0.6 to 0.7 jiao. Hongda, Dingkang, and Hu Heji then sold again, causing a pullback of about 1 yuan. The class C bond traded in and out around the 70-yuan level. The trading finally broke through. The closing price had both rises and falls due to the uneven drop the day before. Class A, B, and C bonds rose by several jiao to 1.4 yuan, while class D and E bonds fell by 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was still more than 3 million yuan. A brief summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 400 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 9 yuan each.</p>
<h3 id="e77">### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Lingers Amid Closing <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, in general, is lingering in a state of indecision. This is due to the approaching end of the lunar year, and the majority of buyers and sellers are watching and waiting, not acting, and waiting for the market to open in the spring before deciding the final outcome. However, the gold group is consistently in a long position, predicting that the upward trend will be more dominant next year, so they are still increasing their positions. As for others in the industry, half are not doing business in both high grade and low grade cottons, and half are buying. Yesterday, 380 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>At the opening of the market for high grade cotton, due to the rebound of the gold price in the afternoon of the previous day, buyers came again, and the momentum was tight. The initial price was 1,420 yuan. Shortly thereafter, it fell to 1,417 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange market was stable and the gold market was relatively firm, it rose again to 1,423 yuan. Those who made profits along the way sold off, and it fell again to 1,408 yuan. At the same time, spot sales were quiet. In a flash, it was heard that the gold price had risen again, and buyers followed the trend up to 1,421 yuan. By 11:30 AM, it suddenly fell, and the claim that gold had fallen resulted in the high grade cotton price falling back to 1,409 yuan. The closing price was 1,411 to 1,412 yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was 5,180 bales. The high grade cotton market had little movement. The sales volume for each group is listed separately below:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 5,000</p>
<p>Inland: 30</p>
<p>Ningbo: 10</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 140</p>
<p>Total: 5,180</p>
<h3 id="e78">### Cotton Market: Mills Have Little Demand <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton market is completely stagnant. This is because the end of the year has arrived, and everyone is busy closing their books, so transactions are quiet. The mills are also closed at the beginning and end of the year, so the demand is increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>Another message is that the New York cotton market is quite soft due to the taking of profits and by selling off by the public. As a result, the closing price was more than ten points lower than the previous day's close. Indian cotton rose slightly due to speculative buying, but later fell due to public selling and the easing of the war situation. Yesterday, the forecasts were down another three rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton market is virtually at a standstill due to the end of the year.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Grains: Rice Market at the Edge of the Final Settlement Period; Rice Prices Have Risen by 50 Yuan in a Year; 600,000 Bags in Stock, with 400,000 More Expected <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Spot foreign rice saw sellers emerge yesterday, and the market continued to decline. Currently, there are 450,000 to 460,000 bags in stock, and more than 100,000 bags are either already arrived or expected to arrive soon, for a total of no less than 600,000 bags. Actual sales are low, and merchants are inactive. Although the big firms are holding firm, the market is still being suppressed by scattered sellers. As a result, the price is down by about 1 yuan from the previous market. The futures market has little float, and large firms are holding firm. Only a little more than 300 tons were traded yesterday. The selling prices of No. 2 Saigon and Small Bending are similar to the previous day. Only No. 1 road cargo, priced at 81.5 yuan per picul, is slightly lower due to its proximity to the spot market. New transactions saw Heyi selling more than 1,000 tons of No. 1 Saigon for March delivery at a price of 88 yuan, which was bought by trading firms. However, foreign firms sold more and absorbed less, and most people are bearish. The spot market only traded a little more than 3,000 bags due to the approaching settlement. Furthermore, as it is the last day of the major winter settlement period, most stores and merchants had already completed their business two or three days earlier, so the sales market has weakened. The overall situation shows a closing atmosphere. Those merchants with a large amount of goods on hand are still trying to sell them off due to financial constraints, but there are few outlets, and the market is chaotic. The settlement prices are estimated as follows: No. 1 Saigon foreign rice at 85 to 83 yuan, No. 2 at 80.08 to 77 yuan, No. 1 Siam, high-quality old stock, determined at 85 to 80 yuan, Fire Bending at 81.5 to 81 yuan, Small Bending at 73 to 72 yuan, Rice Tea at 68 yuan, and Broken Tip Special, ranging from 66 yuan second-grade to 57 yuan third-grade.</p>
<p>For thick and thin japonica rice, Changbang Yuanbai japonica is 106 to 107 yuan, Kunshan Yuanbai japonica is 104 yuan, and Huxian japonica is 102 to 103 yuan, up to 100 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice Huxian is 97 to 96.7 yuan, and original package is 101 yuan. Glutinous rice is rare both coming and going, with no movement in the market. Liyuan remains at 90 yuan, Gangyuan is 78 yuan, determined at 75 yuan, and Nuolv is 71 yuan.</p>
<p>Looking back at the market's rise and fall throughout the year, the price of foreign rice at the beginning of spring was around 40 yuan, and currently it is more than 80 yuan. The price has risen by 50 yuan per picul. Domestic rice has risen even more due to disrupted supply. It is said that Changxi rice has disappeared from the market, and Kunshan japonica has become the best japonica rice. The rice produced in the Changxi area is all being taken away by a certain party, and imports to Shanghai are being prevented, making japonica rice a scarce commodity in Shanghai. The japonica rice being sold is also mostly mixed, with thick and thin pieces mixed together. You pay a high price but cannot get good rice. It is the same with foreign rice. No. 1 Saigon originally contained 25% broken rice, or 40 out of 200 parts, but now the so-called No. 1 Saigon in each rice store contains much more broken rice, not just 20%. As for the end of the settlement period, the Shanghai storage, according to industry insiders, including all shops, is no less than 600,000 to 700,000 bags. This storage cannot be considered weak. Furthermore, there are 300,000 to 400,000 bags of February futures arriving, bringing the total to nearly a million bags, enough to feed the entire population of Shanghai for four months. It is predicted that the market will not experience a storm when the market reopens, and rice prices may decline again. The rice market has ended. We will report again when the market reopens on the fifth or sixth day of the new year.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is arriving one after another. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 9,296 bags from Hong Kong, and unloaded them at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Coal: Indian Coal Quiet <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Indian bituminous coal has been very sluggish recently. Factories have stopped working due to the end of the year, and demand is weak. Orders from merchants are also very small. The market situation is very depressed, and the market price is declining due to oversupply. Recently, the price of Indian lump coal has fallen below 230 yuan, and the price of standard coal has also fallen to 210 yuan. Therefore, it is difficult to rebound during this lunar year.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Piece Goods: Little Activity in Cotton Cloth <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was stable yesterday. With the lunar year end approaching, most merchants and dealers have stopped trading and are waiting for business to resume next spring. There are no large-scale sales to customers. Industry insiders have absorbed slightly lower-priced hand goods, and most of the sales market is stagnant. Hand goods have seen slight differences in sales prices. The total sales volume on the street was over 200 pieces. Customers from the Ningbo and Wenzhou groups bought 50-60 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth. Customers from the Fujian and Guangdong groups bought 100+ pieces of Dapeng, Changgui fine cloth, pongee, and colored cloth. Customers from the northern route bought 100+ pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>The Eastern Cloth market was stable. The finest white cloth fluctuated between 45.10 yuan and 45.05 yuan. There was some trading in the morning, but the market was unusually quiet in the afternoon. Fine cloth and high-grade fine twill cloth of mid-range brands were out of stock, and prices increased by 0.15-0.3 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Woolen Cloth Industry Busy Collecting Debts <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The woolen cloth industry was mostly busy collecting debts yesterday, especially the consignment group, which had more to do because they extended more credit than the major groups on Qipan Street. Looking at this year's collection rate, the majority were worse than the last two years. The industry extended more credit to the Western suit industry than in previous years and were more lenient in their selection. Consequently, the percentage collected during the end-of-year period was also lower.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Fall <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Why Use a Substitute to Find an Export Certificate? The Shanghai silk market has been dull this week. Yesterday, silk merchants slightly increased their inventory. White Filature Silk 20/22 78 grade was sold at 4,950 yuan. The price at the end of last week was 5,150 yuan. Therefore, it was down 200 yuan from the previous market.</p>
<p>Previously, there was a rumor that an export certificate was obtained for the price of 250 yuan. To avoid causing a misunderstanding in the silk industry, I would like to clarify that, as far as I know, recently, due to difficult inspections, among the silk merchants' clients, there were some with surplus funds who were not in a hurry to sell and were willing to sell their goods at a good price. However, their previously obtained export certificates, which had already been inspected, could be transferred to others. And the clients who wanted to get rid of inventory quickly, could obtain this and be able to export, hence there was a "price of 250 yuan to obtain an export certificate." However, this type of transaction is limited to the relationship between silk merchants, and is not standard or permanent in nature.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stable <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market trended stable yesterday, with the settlement approaching. Spot prices for 2/4 grade coarse white sugar were 82.6 yuan for February 15 delivery, and 80.15 yuan to 82.4 yuan for February 10 delivery, unchanged. Taikoo car white B Mark East pier old goods were 82.15 yuan, West pier new goods were 82.3 yuan, and small 0.2 yuan. DY Mark West pier new goods were 80.5 yuan, and HX Mark West pier new goods were 80.2 yuan. Dutch red was 66.7 yuan to 66.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e85">North-South Goods: Vermicelli Sales Active and Rising <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Due to the approaching lunar New Year, demand for longkou vermicelli has increased sharply, so the price has rebounded. Yesterday, the price of Longkou vermicelli was 190 yuan, up more than 10 yuan. Qingdao vermicelli was 160 yuan, up 5 yuan. Gao Jiangbei vermicelli also required 120 yuan. The market is stable.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Black Melon Seeds, Large Size, More Popular <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The supply of black melon seeds is naturally scarce, and the production price is tight. With the approaching lunar New Year, the sales volume of this item is naturally high, so large-sized Jikui seeds rose by 6 yuan, now at 106 yuan. The rest are slightly tight. Considering the current stock level, there is still a long selling period ahead, and there should be continued tightening.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Hardware: Price Surge Begins Sharply <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The hardware market, due to the approaching end of the year and the interruption of overseas supplies, is seeing traders hoarding goods and anticipating a bullish start to the new year. The quoted prices of various goods are changing several times a day, and all are rising without decline. The price surge is unstoppable. Current quoted prices for various goods in the market are: Wooden pegs and braces, $82 per barrel; bamboo steel bars, $1,400 per ton; black iron billets, $1,500 per bundle; British steel plates, 7.5mm, $110; 5mm, $105; 1mm or thicker patterned plates require $115; Menglin steel, 4mm, $125; new lead wire, sizes 8 to 15, $115; sizes 16 to 20, $145; sizes 21 to 25, $170.</p>

<p>The finals of the third New Six Cup Table Tennis Team Tournament, Friendly Nation vs. China Righteousness A, are scheduled to be held on February 9th.

Tickets for today are priced at 30 cents, with a limit of 100 tickets. Also, in last night's match between Industrial China and Evening Glow to compete for fourth place in Group A, Industrial China, having previously missed the opportunity to win the runner-up spot, suffered a significant blow to their morale.

<p>(Guilin Dispatch) The establishment of national basic schools in Guizhou Province in recent years has become widespread, but the quality still needs improvement. The provincial government, based on the method for establishing model central national basic schools provided by the First District Administrative Inspectorate, considers it a strategy to improve basic education. It has ordered all counties to pilot the program. The methods are as follows: (1) Each county (city) should establish one model elementary school in principle. (2) They should be located in densely populated areas with convenient transportation and be reorganized from central schools with excellent performance. (3) Model central schools should have full-time principals and teachers, preferably those who have received normal school training.

<h3 id="e102">A Quarrel of a "Virtuous Couple" <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>People in the alley all say that Mr. Wu, the tenant of Room 3 in No. 21, is a very good person. "Couldn't be more proper!" After everyone said that, as if afraid of missing out on a merit, they immediately added, "Isn't Mrs. Wu good too? She keeps all three children clean and tidy. Unlike other families, they're always dragging their snotty noses and making noise in the alley! And they're all so well-behaved. After all, they eat bank food-"</p>
<p>Mr. Wu eats bank food. "Couldn't be more proper!" People in the alley never saw him smoke a cigarette. Nor did any hotel waiters come to the Wu's house. The Wu's only maid often complained to her fellow "sisters" about the hardship of not having tips. Mr. Wu also seemed to have very few social engagements: every morning around eight o'clock, everyone saw him taking Ah Da out. Always that shiny long gown, those peeled "bitter-joy, bitter-joy" old leather shoes! Left hand carrying a satchel. A newspaper and one or two borrowed books from some library tucked under his left shoulder blade. Right hand holding Ah Da. Ah Da, who is more than four years old, is quite lively! "Look, people are already in the first grade before they're even five years old." The hostess of the house next door often said this to her own child. In the afternoon, around five o'clock, the sound of "bitter-joy, bitter-joy" leather shoes echoed in the alley again, that was Mr. Wu coming home on time.</p>
<p>Every morning, before Mr. Wu left the house, Mrs. Wu, wearing a blue cloth cheongsam, her right foot dragging a flat-heeled leather shoe with a broken buckle, would run in from outside carrying a vegetable basket. Don't underestimate her appearance as a female worker; it is said that she graduated from some middle school! Many of the neighboring maids and older sisters would come to ask her to read and write letters. When she came back from buying groceries, she would start cooking in the kitchen with a flurry of activity. Then she would run to the attic to feed Ah San and teach Ah Er to read. As soon as she finished panting, she had to go to school to pick up Ah Da for lunch.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu also came back for lunch. After lunch, he would take Ah Da out again. Mrs. Wu did needlework at home, nursed, ... until about four o'clock, and then went out to pick up Ah Da. ... Their only maid did the cooking, washing clothes, tidying up the rooms, emptying the chamber pots, and so on.</p>
<p>The days passed mechanically, seemingly forever lacking in change. On Sundays, people in the alley only saw the whole Wu family go out. That was when they went to visit Mr. Wu's father, or to the nearby children's park.</p>
<p>Life seemed busy, difficult, and couldn't be more frugal. But there were no complaints, no sighs. Perhaps because there was simply no leisure to do so. Mr. Wu and his wife were united by love. Mrs. Wu had kept her promise to "share joys and sorrows." Only sometimes, Mr. Wu couldn't help but feel ashamed, feeling sorry for his wife and children.</p>
<p>Days passed by in this stagnant, ordinary way. At this time, the outside world had changed greatly! The high tide of prices also frequently impacted this quiet corner. Mrs. Wu began to complain that the vegetables were really expensive, three dishes for one yuan, making people run around in the vegetable market! At the same time, rice, rent, and everything else skyrocketed!</p>
<p>The bank where Mr. Wu worked added a second allowance. But that was of little help. The allowance could not keep up with the jumping prices of rice, rent, and daily necessities! Because of this, Mr. Wu couldn't help but frown. Mrs. Wu, in her own position, shared her husband's worries.</p>
<p>So one day, when their only maid took the opportunity to resign, Mrs. Wu suggested, "We can do without a maid. Wouldn't that save us more than thirty yuan, including wages and food?"</p>
<p>This was decided. Mrs. Wu became even busier. She almost took over all the work of the maid. Mr. Wu also added a lot of trivial matters. Before dawn, Mrs. Wu would get up and not wash the dishes until nine o'clock in the evening. Even with her eyelids heavy, she still had to do some needlework while the children were sound asleep. Mr. Wu didn't sleep either, he had to use this time to read some books or write something to send to the newspaper to exchange for money.</p>
<p>"Isn't this still good?" Mrs. Wu often said to Mr. Wu with a smile. "You've lost weight, dear. You're working too hard!" "Where? No!" Mrs. Wu insisted.</p>
<p>But one day, this "virtuous couple" actually quarreled! The reason for the quarrel was trivial to the point of insignificance: it was a Sunday morning, and Mrs. Wu bought the porridge and vegetables late, and the children clamored for porridge. So Mrs. Wu said, "Ah Da, go buy it!" Mr. Wu was shaving and found these words a bit jarring. "What do you mean by this? If you want me to go, just ask! Why do you have to beat around the bush?"</p>
<p>That's how they started quarreling! Both began to accuse each other of the misery and oppression that life had given them over the past half month. Life was like a filthy river, and they were struggling in it. There was no laughter or singing. They were both wrong.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu did the laundry without eating breakfast. That morning, people in the alley saw Mr. Wu buying a large bundle of pancakes and fried dough sticks and rushing home. This small storm subsided.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"You come in here, I have something to ask you!" Shao Wen suddenly shouted at him loudly.</p>
<p>Rongkui dared not be negligent, hurriedly straightened his blue cloth gown, immediately lifted the curtain and walked in, hanging his hands down, first called out "Seventh Master", and then called out "Sir" to Yu and Zhang respectively.</p>
<p>"What do you old people want to say?"</p>
<p>"I'm asking you... Yesterday there was an old woman-looking woman talking to you suspiciously outside the First Building, what was she doing?" Shao Wen stared at Rongkui's small round face and asked sternly.</p>
<p>"Ah... her? This guy is very frivolous behind people's backs, and pretends to be simple in front of people," the young man stammered and said, "She is my aunt. Yesterday she was discussing family matters with me there.</p>
<p>Shaowen shook his head coldly.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid she's not your aunt, but a matchmaker!"</p>
<p>Zhang Tianming and Yu Zhongqian laughed.</p>
<p>"Yes, she is indeed my aunt, she only got married last year!" Rongkui hurriedly explained, but he was too busy saying it, which revealed a big loophole.</p>
<p>"Only got married last year? Don't be blinded by money! Yesterday that old woman was at least fifty years old!" Shaowen raised his left sleeve even higher, revealing an even more serious spirit, and said: "Tell you, Rongkui, last time you took a hundred dollars from someone and wanted to get customers for your boss, if it really suits your heart, let alone his voice will be ruined, even if that Director Lu knows about his wife's good deeds, he probably won't let her off easily! You eat your boss's food, if you really want to curry favor with him, just take care of those few sets of clothes! I advise you not to worry too much about this kind of thing! Next time I find out about this kind of thing, I will definitely tell you to get out!"</p>
<p>This scolding was indeed not what the famously shrewd Rongkui had expected, but he also knew Yuan Qiye's power, as well as his friendship with Qiu Haitang, so of course he did not dare to resist, and could only repeatedly say: "How dare I, how dare I"; while his feet understood, seizing the opportunity for Yuan Shaowen to turn around and talk to Zhang Tianming, he immediately burrowed out like a rabbit. As he walked back to the First Building, he was calculating in his mind all the way.</p>
<p>"This Yuan Laoqi is even more cunning than me! How could he have known what people were doing in private? It seems that I should stop! Don't end up with no money in my pocket, and break my rice bowl instead." (16)</p>

<h3 id="e105">How to Realize Ideals <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>Some people interpret ideals as delusions and fantasies, believing that they are merely castles in the air that people imagine, and that they will never be realized. From psychological research, we know that this is wrong. Delusion is a symptom manifested by mental patients, and it is a false belief with no possibility of realization. Fantasy is also a manifestation of a tendency towards mental illness. In terms of the degree of the disease, it is more disordered and aimless than delusion, and the patient's behavior completely falls into a confused state of madness.</p>
<p>The most significant difference between ideals and delusions and fantasies lies in the fact that they are based on the objective background of society and the times, and they make reasonable expectations for future careers and work without exceeding the facts. It is a correct concept, and it can also be said to be an organized plan. This concept and plan is produced under the influence of facts.</p>
<p>Since ideals have the possibility of realization, how should we promote their realization?</p>
<p>First, we must grasp reality. Ideals and reality are closely linked. The foundation of ideals must be built on the rock of reality. The magnificent and towering palace of ideals cannot be built unless we hold firmly to reality and make the most of it and improve it. Therefore, everyone who hopes to have a fulfilling future must work hard at present and set a reasonable code of life.</p>
<p>Second, we must proceed step by step and gradually complete. No matter how towering and magnificent the building is, the craftsmen always use bricks and tiles to build it up, and each small action will slowly realize the house that the engineer envisioned. Therefore, if you want any ideal to be realized, you must first divide the large goal into small steps, concentrate your strength, and slowly do it step by step; each success can increase our self-confidence and give an encouragement to the second step of work. With the goal approaching, there is a great certainty of realizing the ideal.</p>
<p>Third, we must persevere and be patient. A decadent and demoralized state of mind is a fatal blow to the realization of ideals. Great achievements must rely on an indomitable spirit and persistent perseverance. It is difficult for people who become discouraged and lose the courage to make a second attempt after encountering setbacks to realize their ideals.</p>
<p>By following the above three points, we can break the common misconception that ideals cannot be realized. Ideals are by no means "utopian." With your perseverance, self-confidence, and continuous efforts, you can definitely achieve a fulfilling realization.</p>

<p>When making a final decision, being able to concentrate fully, the light of reason suddenly shines brightly, illuminating everything thoroughly, leaving no stone unturned. The most fearful thing is to be in a state of confusion, to be at a loss, neither left nor right, reluctantly making a decision, which is mostly wrong, because reason has retreated to a powerless position.</p>
