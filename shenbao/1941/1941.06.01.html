<p>華盛頓　此間高級權威方面宣稱、美國陸軍現已准評陸軍飛行隊之專家駕駛員及機械員辭職、以便彼等至中國飛行、關於美國航空員在中國服務之職任、則各方傳說紛紜、但通常可靠之某方面則指出、彼等將駕駛戰鬥機及運輸機、陸軍部之官員對此事拒絕討論、據悉有一批駕駛及機械員已在赴華途中、合衆社探悉、接受中國雇用之許可、係給與受有一年以七訓練之戰鬥機員及巳畢業之機械員、此等志願者、仍保留其美國國籍、且美國陸軍當局隨時可將彼等召回、此間某華人證實曾與美國陸軍訂立此種辦法、並謂、美國航空員將專門担任運輸職務、問以如此則中國何以需要受有戰鬥訓練之駕駛員、渠稱、因載客飛機有為日方攻擊之危險、故需要有經騐之軍事駕駛員云、據熟悉美國航空訓練之非官觀察家昨晚表示意見謂、美國現時之訓練程序、係欲每年造就駕駛員三萬人、航空機械員十萬人、故可有大批美國飛行專家供給中國、此間某方面所聆悉之未證實消息謂、美國航空員將担任戰鬥職務、此足以使人憶及參議員佩柏爾在最近演說時曾謂、希望准行美國之飛行員代中國問東京報復云、（卅一日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　華人方面對於華盛頓傳來消息謂美國航空隊巳准許其航空員辭職來華投効、表示甚為欣慰、華人方面、以為此舉乃美國表示全力援華政策之最具體最動人之一步、以前華盛頓消息曾謂、美國將綏靖日本、使其晚離軸心、此間聞之會稍覺憂慮、但航空人員來華之消息抵達後、此種憂慮巳為之消除、此决消息除最高方面外、其他各界皆覺其突然而來、但重慶報紙在過去數星期中、已有許多關於美國飛機及航空員之討論、此間過去巳有相當時間得悉重慶欲得美國之飛行員駕駛中國之戰機、以前美國之飛行員係因恐懼彼等來華服務後、或將喪失其美國國籍在美國空軍中之官階、故未敢來華投効、但現時華盛頓傳來之消息則謂、美國陸軍航空員可隨意來華投効、而不致有喪失其官階或國籍之虞、中國方面認此項因素甚為重要、因此輩飛行員自然有作戰之經騐、並有良好之紀律、據華人方面稱、「吾人所需耍者為飛行員、而非冒險家」據傳星期之前已開始準備此輩美國飛行員之食住問題、預料彼等將在一個月或六星期之內抵此、美國助華之飛機式樣雖屬於軍事秘密、但中國空軍總司令毛邦初最近會語合衆社記者稱、「唯有最優良、最新式之美國飛機、方能與日本之新式驅逐機抵抗」云、（三十一日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　猶達省議員多瑪昨日宣稱、「中國與日本倘小出以合作、則遠東將永不繁榮」、惟渠警吿稱、「壓迫之合作終不能成功」、多瑪氏指稱、壓迫之合作縱令暫時成功、「且採取此種强施合作之國家、對其一切鄰邦、仍不免發生許多猜忌也、」多瑪氏係對日本新聞記者發表正式之聲明、渠警吿稱、倘日本進而鼓動「目前毀滅人類生命之侵略者」、則日本將完全失去美國之信任、渠謂、荀日本政府「目下出以此種行動、而致引起戰爭之蔓延、」將為世界之最大錯誤云、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>美日兩國關係在緊急狀態中</p>
<p>華盛頓　政界人士昨表示、國務卿赫爾及日外相松岡洋右本週之談話、巳於目前將美日間改進關係之談判希望加以擱置、兩氏之談話、似將兩國之關係仍停留於數月來之原處、兩國目前雖無立即公開發生衝突之現象、惟實巳處於緊張忿怒狀態之中、多數專家認為兩國之關係、在有希望改進之前、殊有更趨惡劣之可能、此間前曾發表非官方之報吿、謂自羅斯福總統在星期二晚之爐邊談話中、竭力避免對日本作不友好道及後、衆認美。日或有改進邦交之可能、國會人士加以演繹、認為羅期福總統已將其對日政策稍予改變、惟在數小時內、國務卿赫爾聲稱、美國對日關係並無改變、松岡於星期五發表關於日本外交政策對三角聯盟負有責任之文吿、使此間觀祭家認為、係針對赫爾之文吿則發、同時觀察家並指出羅期福總統仕演詞中宣布美國將增加援華、此言斷不能歸納為華盛頓將與東京改進關係、日本或鼠將被逼決定、美國公開軍事援英是吾將根據三角聯盟作為「攻擊」德國之解釋、有人以為、日本能聲言美國援英並非直接攻擊德國、因而避免履行三角聯盟之義務、如納粹首先開火攻擊美艦、日本亦可諉稱德國如不先行開火、則殊無被一國攻擊之事、借此遁詞、日本即能不受三角聯盟義務之束縛、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國全國之「史裕列茲霍華德」京報紙、昨日一致撰評稱羅斯福總統星期二在爐邊談話中、證明少數國會及內閣「發言人」實屬錯誤、羅斯福在談話中、無異向美國護航之謠言、澆下冷水、該社評又稱、「柏潑式」之轟炸東京威脅與護航問題同其危險、社評又稱、「多數方面認美國已關閉對日談判之門戶、並認為戰事不可避免、關於此論、美國與日本復應注目于羅斯福總統及國務卿赫爾、而不應妄信彼等作態好戰之「代表」焉、因此輩「代表、奏歪曲其所代表者之眞義、」該社評又云、總統尖銳地在邊爐談話中避免對日本作口頭上攻擊、並謂總統「正抵抗力謀促成美日戰事之壓力、總統乃一脚踏實地者、渠知無好戰之國、亦無能自戰爭中獲利之國、」社評末云、「聞於總統勢將拒絕與日本作任何合作、以謀在太平洋成立和平、殊不足置信、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　日文報紙均以顯著地位、讚揚松岡洋右昨夜之宣言、謂軸心盟的為日本外交政策不可動搖之基礎、各報均加以擁護、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>

<p>羅斯福總統日前發表「爐邊談話」之後，一部份人似乎因為美國還不參戰，或還不採取實際攻勢行動，而嫌其小夠刺激，這不是故意貶低這篇談話的重要性，便是由於期望太殷，遂致猶感不足，實則羅斯福總統之宣佈無限制緊急狀態的存在，早已是一個非交戰國家元首在其權力範圍內所能做到的最大舉措，其意義之重大，實有細加尋繹的必要。</p>
<p>在檢討美國此一動態的眞價之前、首須明瞭美國和侵略陣綫所相互採取的立塲，彼此完全不同：美國的反侵略政策，是以實事求是的實際行動為內容，三角同盟的對美政策却大半是些虛聲恫嚇的姿態作用；因為美國早已確定「必須援助民治根絕侵略以自保安全」的國策，所以一向不問侵略國對她作何感想，不怕侵略國對她作何恫嚇，更不受侵略國對她作何勾引，祇是一貫地不怕事，不畏難，向着既定國策邁進，她的唯一問題祗在如何準備國內，如何充實自身，可說自從決定援助民治國之日起，經過租借法案的成立和實施，以迄一昨緊急狀態的宣佈存在，美國的反侵略政策始終在一貫地躍進着，從未轉過半　灣，更從未有過片刻遲疑；反之，三角同盟的對美態度，却始終祗是唯恐美國干涉得太積極，所以一向以虛聲恫嚇為行動的極則，（雖然有時仍不免有一些諂媚外交的死恢復燃），不惜想出種種方法，、妄期嚇退美國或阻撓延宕美國的行動，所以侵略陣綫自始即怕多事，怕眞幹，自從三國結盟一直到最近德日義三國當局的彼此唱和，唯一的形態祇是恫嚇，却不敢直接去向美國挑戰，或直接和美國作對，因為依照侵略國自已所。的定義，似乎美國援助各民治國的行動早已搆成了可以向之宣戰的理由，而實際上同盟國非獨沒有宣戰，甚至連照例的抗議也放棄了，生怕弄假成眞，惹翻了實幹眞幹的美國；允其可笑的，是直到現在為止，各同盟國對於盟的的解釋，似乎還沒有弄淸楚。</p>
<p>美國的積極立塲雖和侵略陣綫的恫嚇姿態根本不同，但就立塲的性能而言，美國究竟處於靜的一面，而德義日三國則處於動的一面，所以單就戰不戰一層立論，美國必定處於被動地位，換言之，美國最多做到一方嚴陣以待，一方不顧以切推進她的援助政策，除非侵略陣綫首先觸犯她，美國決不會也決不値主動地首先宣戰。準此而論，世人倘欲追問美國會不會戰，必須先問侵略陣綫是吾是眞有一捋美國虎鬚的勇氣和準備，再說得具體一點，須問德國是不是眞正準備於美國護航時擊沉美國船艦，日本是不是眞止準備援引三國盟的，而在遠東方面響應德義的對英攻勢，假定是的話，美國既已宣佈緊急狀態，表示了最大決心，必然應戰無疑，假定不然，則美國既祗求她的援助政策不受妨碍、俾使各民治國在她支援之下戰勝侵略，當然也就樂得繼續保持非交戰國的地位。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，可見美國的宣佈緊急狀態，正是退可以守進可以攻的最積極舉措，表示美國已不存僥倖圖免的心理，表示美國絕無「怕戰」的心理，表示美國絕不因侵略陣綫的恫嚇而「知難而退一；這種態度出之於一個非交戰國家，難道還不能算積極到了巔峯狀態嗎？難道還不足表示美國義無返顧的仁俠精神嗎？</p>

<p>經濟業谈</p>
<p>— 馮柳星</p>
<p>物價統計（二）</p>
<p>自經此一番訓練工作，不意為後來各報添關商業金融新聞專版，無意中為之造成許多旣明商情又能寫作之通信員，此固各報一種意外收穫。如民國十年一月，首先為上海中文日報界開闢商業金融新聞版的商報，民國十一年四月繼起仿辦之新聞報經濟新聞版，及申報之商業新聞版，當開辦時之通信員，大都得力於貨價處調査員，迄今猶恐尙有不少在內也。其後各報之商業新聞，類皆依樣葫蘆，另立一門，於是各業中人，耳濡目染，得所師承倣效，寫商業稿件者漸多。此於工商業文化進步上，自有其相當關係，為近人所不及知，故舉而出之也。</p>
<p>適民國八年歐戰和議開會於巴黎，時張季直為中國實業界泰斗，思棄機解除中國協定稅則之束縛，獲得關稅自主，乃聯絡滬商，組織稅則平等會，猶不敢公然以自主相號召，惟恐觸各國商人之忌也。但欲求關稅自主，必須有自定之稅則，先之以自行調查之貨價，循此以求，霎時間，初開辦之調査貨價處，忽為上海大商人所注意。但各國對於在華經濟巳得利權，誰肯輕易放棄，何况又在軍閥時代，更不値一顧，故雖有代表一人，赴歐預備向和會有所陳述，終於一塲無結果而返。其時商界何嘗知關稅自主之重要，甚至正有利用進口稅率低，便於侔利；故不久而貨價調查處工作，又不為工商界所重視矣。</p>
<p>其先所調査者，尙限於進口洋貨部份，從各色各樣之買賣單位，一律折合成担，換算為關平，此其間在素無修養準備之調查工作下，當然是艱苦萬分，蓋須開闢一條工作道路來。及按月編査完畢，按季造報財政部。民國十一年修訂稅則，仍以蔡廷幹主其事，即已採用此項物價，以為計算稅則之張本。惟外人尙以平時不公布為言，遂於民國十一年開始編行中英文貨價季刋，繼編行物價月報，連帶舉辦商品調査，各業調査。此項調査，至今猶為人主張不置，而不知調査貨價處，在其時早已在工作中矣。</p>
<p>指數Index　Number一名詞，為日人所譯，在中國本未之見，其實就字論義，不難解釋。每見有應須指示之處所，繪一手握拳，而以一指作指示狀，其下或綴以「由此入內」，「由此轉灣」等字樣，此握拳直指之食指，即所謂Index含有指示之意義。故指數云者，乃以一羣數字，費一點編製工作，成為一個或幾個之數字，以指不其趨勢高低，藉便於比較觀察耳！易言之，此即指示物價「緣是而高」「緣是而小」之數字也。余不欲於此談指數界說，惟為一般讀者瞭解計，聊借喩以備一說耳！</p>
<p>中國之有物價指數，始於民國八年（西歷一九一九年）九月調査貨價處之上海躉售物價指數，以調査精確，編制詳明，故不久，而各國統計刊物中已有China或Shanghai之字樣，是亦中國學術界之光也。該處又於民國十四年編行輸出入物價指數；至民國十九年，上海第一個生活費指數，亦行發表。</p>
<p>繼貨價處而為統計工作者，則為上海巿社會局。上海市社會局各部分均有統計，若公益慈善事業，工商業，以及勞工事業，茲所言，祇就勞工部分所編之工人生活費指數也。由蔡正雅主其專，先行工人家計調査Family　Budget，繼編指數，於民國二十一年發表。</p>
<p>自八一三戰事作，各種指數，皆以所編機關之關係，先後停頓，良可惜也。會國際勞工事務方面，仍需要上海工人生活費指數，而上海社會亦未嘗不同有此需要。遂由中國統計學社上海分社出而籌畫，不以一時之時局關係，而致工人生活費指數有中斷之虞。勉籌局部分調査費用，仍由蔡正繼任編製。未幾款罄，旋以某四人之力，乃得工部局之維持，即迄兮各報所謂之工部局工人生活費指　是也。惟將基期，從民國十五年（一九二六年）改為民國二十五年（即滬戰前之一年為一九三六年）作標準矣。</p>
<p>中國之有物價指數，固以上海為發祥地；而天津之有物價指數則自何廉始。何從美國斐雪爾敎授學統計歸國，的在民國十五年，道經滬上，其後即至南開大學任敎授，於是天津始有物價指數行世。自是各省市之編行物價指數者，雖旋作旋輟，當不下三四十種，但繼續編製者寥寥十餘種，迄今恐有大多數巳在停頓中。</p>
<p>余雖未嘗窺統計學之門徑，然亦竊喜就數字以為整理，作成簡單的統計，為說明事物之助。民國十五年會就民兀以來之外匯，按月編一外匯指數，至民國十五年止，曾刊布於民國十六年商報元旦增刊。今原稿遺失，商報亦於民國十六年終停刊，並舊報亦無從檢起。</p>
<p>在中國自編物價指數之前，尚有外人如英人Wetmore及日本幣制委員會，均編有中國物價指數，但其物價之來源，恐亦不出貿易冊範圍之外也。今則指數編製之方式，進步甚速，分門別類，不一其道，蓋已成為專門之學，非舊日之簡單編製，所可同日而語也。近如生活費指數分類方法，亦有趨向於從現行之五類（即食物衣着房租燃　雜項）而改為四類（即食物住屋衣着雜項）之舉。待此决戰事吿終，一切經濟組織，將發生非常之變動，物價指數，旣為經濟生活所表現，焉有不加改革之理哉！（完）</p>
<p>勘誤　校對之難，如掃落葉，不意本文中竟有原稿不誤而所排適得其反，如「洋貨本欲推銷於中國，利於稅輕」，而誤為「利於稅重」，未曾校出，此外如隱瞞誤為蘊瞞，關係尙微，其他如有誤字，能以意會得之者，不再訂正。</p>

<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>愛迪生，美國的一位大發明家，這是誰都知道的，也是大家所最景仰的。</p>
<p>他一生所發明的事物，有一千數百種之多。他給予人們的幸福，將永遠地受到人們的歌頌。</p>
<p>但是，他並不是什麽大生的異人，當他幼年的時候，和你們一樣地最歡喜玩耍，不過他又歡喜硏究科學，隨時隨地留心各種新事物，常常問長問短，窮根究底，父常常自己動手試騐，有時試騐失敗，但他毫不灰心，繼續再做屢敗屢試，直到成功了才罷手。所以，他的偉大的成就，完全是他自己刻苦用功的結果。他常常對人家說：「我的成績，都是從辛苦努力中得來的。」</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！你們在享用他所發明的東四時，應當怎樣景仰他，效法他？小朋友！只要你們現在養成一個科學的孩子，利用你們聰明的頭腦，向大自然追討，利用你們萬能的雙手，從事科學的試騐。那來，你們將來便是愛迪生第二！</p>
<h3 id="c86">端午節的迷信 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>日子過得眞快，春天巳悄悄地逝去了，夏隨着到來，而端午節便是初夏的一個挺够注目的節目。水果店裏堆滿着黃金色的枇杷，茶食店裏陳列着各式各樣的粽子。鄰家的門前掛着像野草一般的葉子，上面還繫着一個大蒜，這種種映在阿亮簡單的腦海中，便不知道為什麽這許多東西在端午節那天竟都出現了？</p>
<p>「好，我一件件的來吿訴給你聽？」當阿亮的爸爸看見阿亮這副莫明其妙的神態，便這樣的向他說。阿亮聽得了他爸爸肯替他一一解釋，當然是再快樂也沒有了。便靜靜地等待爸爸打開他的話匣子來。</p>
<p>「粽子的來源，相傳是在我國古時的楚國中有一位大詩人，名叫屈原，在當時每個人都知道他的。有一天他因憂國之故，投汨羅江而死，於是當地的百姓便裏粽子來紀念他，屈原投江的那一天恰是五月初五，所以在端午節吃粽子便有紀念屈原的意思，這種事倒還有些意義。而最迷信的，便是在端午節剷除五毒—蛇，蜈蛟，蛛蜘，壁虎，蝦蟆的傳說，用什麽東西去剷涂它的呢？便是掛在門上的艾，蒲，和大蒜，因為蒲像一柄寳劍，可以殺死它們；而艾和大蒜有刺鼻的矣氣，可用臭氣來嚇退它們，你想道種思想幼稚不幼稚，豈不可笑？更在那天的中午，飲雄黃酒，據說是可以解除蛇虫的毒。最無聊的，便在那天把小孩打扮得奇形怪狀，身穿着印着老虎的火黃衣，脚上的鞋子襪子都是火黃色的，鞋子更繡着老虎的鬍鬚，耳，眼，口，鼻，鈕子上掛着用綫織成樟腦袋，黃老虎，騎囝和角粽，長長的一串，獲說是有壓邪的效能，在額上用雄黃劃成王字，是可以解毒的。中午更在每間房屋中薰蚊烟條，從此毒虫的蹤跡可以滅絕。端午節的那一天，是火黃色最出風頭的時候，甚至吃的東西，也擇其有黃色的，所以在那天一定更吃枇杷，黃魚，黃瓜，黃鱔，有的都是黃色，有的有其名而無其實，道種種子細地一想，實在是連愚人也不會做出的事，然而現在却在自認聰明的人一一的把它搬弄了。這些都是毫無意義而迷信的事。而且在端午節還有送禮的習俗，允其在這米珠薪桂的現在，禮實在是送不起，動一動手便要幾十元，况且送來送去仍舊自吃自的，道徒然的浪費金錢，那何必多此一舉呢？還有什麼白蛇傳裹的白娘娘在端午節現原形，這更是惡俗不堪的邪說，世界上竟有這愚蠢的事嗎？實在是應當加以禁止的。所以這個端千節，眞是充滿了烏烟瘴氣，不過我們當淸凈淸凈我們的頭腦，一一的把這種不合理而迷信的舉動廢除，這是現代的小朋友應當幹的一種有意義的工作。」阿亮聽完了這話，覺得很對，便想先向他的親戚們一一解釋，來破除這端午節種種的迷信。</p>

<p>在美國紐的地方，有一個叫雷狄的翰蓀的女孩子，年紀才二歲；可是伊每月的收入竟可超出伊爸爸當中學科學敎員的薪俸，並且已有一筆鉅大的款額在銀行內。小朋友必定要問我，俘那裹來的這麽許多收入呢？原來這位小天使，自從生出滿二個月後，伊的照片有的就被難誌作為封面的材料，有的是被人家登在報上作廣吿的宣傳；實在因為伊的一副面貌生得太秀麗了，而上照後更顯得動人；所以迄至今日，差不多凡是美國出版的較大的雜誌或報章，都可以有伊的照相發現；當然，伊的照片是不能够給人家任意拍取的，第一須徵求伊家長的同意，第二拿它做宣傳少不了要拿出些酬報給這位小天使的。最近伊平均每星期獲得的這種酬報至少是六七十元美金，最有趣的伊不肯給人家拍一種哭時的照相，而在開麥拉前叫伊睡覺却最為歡喜。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們對於這位小天使都會感到羨慕嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c88">打手心 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 何逸厂</p>
<p>我住的一間樓室，恰正對着隔壁一家小學校的樓窗。那樓窗裹面，是個課堂。每天小學生的讀書聲，鼓歌聲，喧閙着我的耳唱。有是還夾着一種劈劈拍拍，特殊的聲浪，原來是在『打手心。』接着先生的呵斥聲，小學生的啼哭聲，轟然雜作。這種聲浪，每天可以聽到。有時竟會繼續不斷，打了一個又一個。我雖則是聽慣了，但心中總覺得有異樣的感觸，時常在慨嘆着：『小朋友，你們為什麼要挨打？你們好了的皮肉，為什麽要受這樣的苦痛』？照敎育的原則來講：『體罰』在學校裹，是早在禁止之列。打手心，也是體罰的一種。但據一般執敎鞭的先生們說：小學生總是頑皮的多，有的地方，簡直不打不成功。因此凡是小學堂裹，什九都有這體罰。而打手心，於是成為最普遍的體罰。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們倘受了這種體罰，也應該返躬自省，痛定思痛。究竟為什麼緣故，要受這苦痛？依我想來，大約有兩種原因：一，是不聽敎訓。不肯用功勤讀，敎過的書多遺忘，預備的課程，不能按時繳出。二，是不守規則。油腔滑詞，同學間時相戲謔衝突。或損毀他人書籍，或偷取他人物件。犯了以上幾種毛病，當然有挨打的資格了。所以小朋友們，無論在學堂裹或家庭裏，總要服從敎訓，遵守規則。每天要捫心自問，今天有沒有過處？要有則改之，無則加勉。』那末放在敎師案前的『戒尺，』雖則動輒打人，恐怕也無從施其技，沒有『用武之地』了。</p>
<h3 id="c89">三個普通問題 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 仁卿</p>
<p>「第一為什麽我們呼出的氣，必須等到天冷時才看得見呢？」</p>
<p>我們從肺內呼出的氣，熱度是常常樣的；但是外面空氣的變化却是非常之大，天氣冷的時候，我們呼出的氣，熱度比面空氣的熱度來得高，所以一離我們身體，驟然遇到冷，就會外成功一片水點變成輕霧，我們看見的就是這輕霧，至於天氣過暖的時候，外面空氣的熱度高，沒有影響到我們呼出的氣裹面的水氣，所以我們就看不見了。</p>
<p>『第二爲什麽我們閉了眼睛，好像就看見紅光？』</p>
<p>這個問題非常的奇妙而有趣，我們的眼睛是稍微有些透明的，它不能止住外界的光，穿進眼睛來，當我們閉了眼睛，朝光亮裏看的時候，這經過眼睛的光，就經過那常在我們眼睛裹的紅血：那紅血就會把其他的光線留住，單讓紅色光射進來，所以我們就看見一片紅光了。</p>
<p>『第三為什麽我們不能開了眼睛睡覺？』</p>
<p>我們在睡覺的時候，能不能把手舉在空中，不能！爲什麽緣故呢？那是和現在要講的不能開着眼睛睡覺的緣故相同。我們睡覺，是為了休息體力，我們的眼睛，在睜着的時侯，也是用力的，所以到了睡覺的時候，我們的眼皮，因自己的重量面下垂，換句話說：就是在休息，所以我們在睡覺的時候，一定會閉上眼睛！</p>

<p>許靖聽王永泰這樣說，又是一怔自己秘密到此揭破姦情，怎麼仰老人家早已知道我到此呢？奇奇奇！只得叉手說道：「小娃此舉自知、覺孟浪，未曾禀明伯父而後行事，務請您老人家原諒。只因小姪前番受了不白之寃，自度沒有機會在伯父面前分辯，而他們兩人的曖昧情事，小姪早巳看在眼裏，所以今夜前來，特地將他們雙雙擒住，然後到伯父面前請罪，兼稟緣由；一則使世伯明白小姪的寃枉，二則也為伯父消除未來的隱憂。伯父是明達的，諒必能够曲諒小姪吧。」王永泰聽了，點點頭，走至二人面前，瞧見二人這種齷齪穢瑣的情狀，不由氣往上術，鬍鬚倒豎，喝一聲「賤人！你做得好事！顚倒在我面前造作讕語，誣衊好人，離開我和許賢姪，使我負失察之咎。今日你們你一雙狗男女，有何面目見我？」許靖在旁也對何說道：「凡事是非曲直，自有水落石出之日。你現在可向我伯父說個明白，究竟我來調戲你，還是你來勾引我？我許靖是個頂天立地的男兒，誰肯如你這樣做出禽獸的勾當？」王永泰也把脚一蹬，從他衣襟裏颼的抽出一柄光亮犀利的匕首來，指着何姬，厲聲說道：「賤人快快招來！今番還能狡辯嗎？」何姬流着眼淚說道：「這件事實在是我做錯的，因我誘引許公子不成，恐他要在你面前說破我的不是，所以那天晚上在你面前造事生非，故意誣陷他的，實是我一念之錯，自知不配做你老爺的姬妾，拜求老爺顧及前數年恩愛之情，饒恕我這條狗命，放我回去吧，我當終身不忘你的大德。」遂將自己如何誘引許靖，以及故留手帕的事，吿訴一遍。王永泰咬着牙齒說道：「若不是今宵有賢姪揭穿你們的秘密，我不是至令還蒙在鼓裏嗎？唉！中　之醜，難為人道，我王永泰的老臉全被你們丟盡了。又對桑一淸駡一聲「狗賊！我待你不薄，却不料你人面獸心，忘恩負義，和這淫娃勾搭，你的肉還足食嗎？你又有何說？」（七八）</p>

<h3 id="e3">Expected to Arrive in Chongqing Within Two Months or Six Weeks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>Washington - It is claimed by senior authorities here that the U.S. Army has now approved the resignation of expert pilots and mechanics from the Army Air Corps so that they may fly in China. There are various rumors about the positions of American aviators serving in China, but one usually reliable source indicates that they will fly fighter planes and transport planes. Officials of the Department of the Army declined to discuss the matter. It is understood that a group of pilots and mechanics are already en route to China. The Associated Press has learned that permission to accept Chinese employment is granted to fighter pilots who have received one year of intensive training and to graduate mechanics. These volunteers retain their American nationality, and the U.S. Army authorities can recall them at any time. A certain Chinese here confirmed that such an arrangement had been made with the U.S. Army, and said that American aviators will be exclusively responsible for transport duties. When asked why China would need fighter-trained pilots, he said that because passenger planes are in danger of being attacked by the Japanese, experienced military pilots are needed. A non-official observer familiar with American aviation training commented last night that the current American training program aims to produce 30,000 pilots and 100,000 aviation mechanics each year, so a large number of American aviation experts can be supplied to China. Unconfirmed news heard here indicates that American aviators will assume combat duties, which is reminiscent of Senator Pepper's recent speech, in which he expressed the hope that American pilots would be allowed to retaliate against Tokyo on behalf of China. (31st United Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese circles have expressed great delight at the news from Washington that the U.S. Air Force has approved the resignation of its aviators to come to China to serve. Chinese circles believe that this move is the most concrete and moving step in the U.S.'s expression of its full support for China. Previous news from Washington had indicated that the U.S. would appease Japan to keep it away from the Axis powers, which caused some concern here. However, after the news of the arrival of aviation personnel in China, this concern has been dispelled. Except for the highest levels, all other sectors found this decision to be sudden. However, Chongqing newspapers have had many discussions about American planes and aviators in the past few weeks. It has been known here for some time that Chongqing wants American pilots to fly Chinese warplanes. Previously, American pilots had been afraid to come to China to serve because of the fear that they would lose their American nationality and rank in the U.S. Air Force after serving in China. However, the news from Washington now states that U.S. Army aviators can come to China to serve at will without fear of losing their rank or nationality. China considers this factor to be very important, as these pilots naturally have combat experience and good discipline. According to Chinese sources, "What we need are pilots, not adventurers." It is rumored that preparations for the food and lodging of these American pilots began last week, and they are expected to arrive here within a month or six weeks. Although the type of aircraft the United States is helping China with is a military secret, Mao Bangchu, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Air Force, recently told a reporter from the Associated Press, "Only the best and most modern American aircraft can resist Japan's new fighter planes." (31st United Press)</p>
<p>Washington - Utah Senator Thomas declared yesterday, "The Far East will never prosper unless China and Japan cooperate." However, he warned, "Cooperation under oppression will not succeed." Thomas pointed out that even if cooperation under oppression succeeds temporarily, "the country that adopts such enforced cooperation will inevitably arouse much suspicion among all its neighbors." Thomas made the formal statement to Japanese journalists. He warned that if Japan goes on to incite "aggressors who are currently destroying human life," Japan will completely lose the trust of the United States. He said that if the Japanese government "takes such action now, leading to the spread of war," it would be the world's biggest mistake. (31st United Press)</p>
<p>U.S.-Japan Relations in a State of Emergency</p>
<p>Washington - Political figures stated yesterday that Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's talks this week have currently shelved hopes for improved relations between the U.S. and Japan. The two men's talks seem to have left the two countries' relations in the same place they have been for months. Although there is no immediate public conflict between the two countries, they are in a state of tension and anger. Most experts believe that relations between the two countries are likely to worsen before there is any hope of improvement. It was previously reported here unofficially that since President Roosevelt strongly avoided any unfriendly remarks about Japan in his fireside chat on Tuesday night, it was generally believed that the U.S. and Japan might improve relations. Congressional figures interpreted it as President Roosevelt having slightly changed his policy towards Japan. However, within hours, Secretary of State Hull declared that there was no change in the U.S.'s relations with Japan. Matsuoka's statement on Friday regarding Japan's foreign policy being responsible for the Tripartite Pact made observers here believe that it was directed against Hull's statement. At the same time, observers also pointed out that President Roosevelt announced in his speech that the U.S. would increase aid to China, which cannot be interpreted as Washington improving relations with Tokyo. Japan may be forced to decide whether the U.S.'s open military aid to Britain is to be interpreted as an "attack" on Germany under the Tripartite Pact. Some believe that Japan can claim that U.S. aid to Britain is not a direct attack on Germany, thus avoiding fulfilling the obligations of the Tripartite Pact. If the Nazis fire on American ships first, Japan can also excuse itself by saying that if Germany does not fire first, there is no attack by one country. By this excuse, Japan will be able to avoid being bound by the obligations of the Tripartite Pact. (31st United Press)</p>
<p>Washington - The "Scripps-Howard" newspapers of the United States unanimously wrote editorials yesterday, saying that President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Tuesday proved that a few congressmen and cabinet "spokesmen" were wrong. In his speech, Roosevelt poured cold water on rumors of U.S. convoys. The editorial also said that "Popper's" threat to bomb Tokyo is as dangerous as the convoy issue. The editorial also said, "Most believe that the United States has closed the door to negotiations with Japan and believes that war is inevitable. Regarding this argument, the United States and Japan should pay attention to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, and should not blindly trust those bellicose 'representatives'. Because these 'representatives' distort the true meaning of those they represent." The editorial also said that the President sharply avoided verbal attacks on Japan in his fireside chat and said that the President "is resisting the pressure to promote war between the U.S. and Japan. The President is a down-to-earth man who knows that there is no good war and no country that can profit from war." The editorial concluded, "It is unbelievable that the President will refuse to cooperate with Japan in order to establish peace in the Pacific." (31st United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers have prominently praised Matsuoka Yosuke's declaration last night, saying that the Axis alliance is the unshakable foundation of Japan's foreign policy. All newspapers have endorsed it. (31st United Press)</p>

<p>Tokyo - The Japanese news weekly published an article today, criticizing the U.S. Congressman West's bill to ban oil shipments to Japan, saying that if the bill is passed by the U.S. Congress, the current unstable situation in the Pacific will worsen. If the U.S. cuts off Japan's oil supply, Japan will naturally have to seek it elsewhere. If Japan can obtain sufficient oil from the Dutch East Indies, the proposed U.S. oil embargo will be ineffective. If Japan cannot obtain oil from the Dutch East Indies by peaceful means, West's bill will force Japan to seize oil-producing land in order to obtain an oil supply. This move will lead to an open break in U.S.-Japan relations, and all attempts to ease tensions in the Pacific will fail. But we dare to predict that the oil dispute may be resolved amicably, because if the bill is passed, the U.S. Congress will not only harm Japan's interests, but also greatly harm its own interests. Oil is essential to Japan in both peacetime and wartime. (31st Reuters)</p>
<p>Batavia - According to Japanese sources, Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative at the Batavia economic talks, said today that the Japanese delegation is now only waiting for the Dutch East Indies to respond to its proposal. The reply can be sent on June 5. Japan's proposal was stated at the first meeting with Mr. Mook on May 11 and reiterated on May 14. There is nothing else to be done now. (31st Reuters)</p>

<p>Washington - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has notified police departments in major cities across the country that special precautions must be taken this weekend because of intelligence that sabotage may occur in various harbors and national defense factories. The detective team of New York has been ordered to keep a close watch on the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the 45,000-ton battleships Iowa and Mississippi are under construction, and the 35,000-ton North Carolina is being equipped. Police departments on the U.S. Atlantic coast, Pacific coast, and Great Lakes ports have also received the instruction. Among them, the police department of Detlau has taken strict precautions for the factories there, because most of the factories there manufacture national defense supplies, worth as much as 100 million yuan. At the same time, several large factories across the country have been stationed with armed police. (31st United Press)</p>

<p>New York - The Gallup poll announced yesterday that 85% of American voters believe that the United States will participate in the European war before it ends. The association said that the decision was very important because once the United States joins the war, most Americans will not be surprised. Psychologists and historians have repeatedly debated that any country that believes war is inevitable is very likely to participate in the war. The decision to predict U.S. participation in the war has more than doubled compared to when the war first broke out 20 months ago. (31st United Press)</p>
<p>Mountain Home, Tennessee - McNutt, Administrator of the U.S. Federal Security Agency, declared last night that "wherever Chinese and British people are and wherever freedom-loving democratic people are, there will be a permanent threat to dictators." McNutt said that a blitzkrieg can subdue the democratic front, but it cannot break it, because the democratic front is as deeply rooted as the country itself. He urged the United States to strengthen democracy internally and to support the resistance to aggression with weapons externally. He said that democratic armies will win in the world war because the people of democratic countries all have a strong love of freedom and a strong will to defend civilization. (31st United Press)</p>
<p>Addis - Socialist leader and former presidential candidate Tommy Key gave a speech last night, saying that if the U.S. joins the European war, "we will find that we are fighting alone, fighting Germany in the Atlantic and Japan in the Pacific."

<p>Washington - Lieutenant Colonel Haines, chairman of the Old Veterans Committee, yesterday called on the nation to unite so that the United States can "help rebuild peace in the world and maintain peace in the Americas." He said that China was once isolated behind the Great Wall, but the enemy eventually invaded because of the disloyalty of the defenders. He warned that the United States must not have such disloyal behavior. Newkirk, a hero of the U.S. World War, called for the implementation of convoys for Britain when necessary. He said, "If Britain falls, we will be Hitler's second target." (31st United Press)</p>

<p>Washington - The Philippine Commissioner to the United States said that the announcement of Philippine export controls is an example of defense cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines. He recently discussed the export control system and other defense matters with Maxwell, the Export Control Administrator, and Acheson, the Undersecretary of State. There has been constant cooperation. He said that U.S. government officials have assured that adequate consideration will be given to the Philippines' economic needs. Maxwell said that no severe measures will be taken. He discussed with the Philippine Commissioner the functions of the export control experts sent to the Philippines. He explained that they will be representatives of the Export Control Administration and the State Department to assist the government. (31st United Press)</p>
<p>New York - According to the Associated Press, Seduvo, chairman of the Philippine Defense Committee, delivered a speech at the Reserve Officers' School the other day. It is said that the current situation shows that the Philippine Islands will inevitably be involved in the war, and the date of participation in the war is much earlier than generally expected. The Philippine armed forces are ready to take action. (31st TASS)</p>
<p>Philippines to Purchase U.S. Destroyers</p>
<p>Manila - According to Japanese sources, according to the small-scale lease-lend bill recently passed by Congress, which stipulates that the United States may sell naval weapons and equipment to the Philippines, the Philippine government is now preparing to purchase three overage destroyers from the U.S. Navy. The news also said that the destroyers purchased by the Philippines are the same as the destroyers delivered to Britain last year, each with a speed of 35 knots per hour, but the necessary funds required for the purchase depend on the funds passed by the U.S. Congress.

<p>Moscow - Thousands of well-trained Soviet soldiers participated in exercises to resist paratroopers and defend against air raids. These exercises are now being conducted in several provinces of Ukraine, on a scale similar to those recently held in Moscow. In addition, thousands more participated in defense against combined air and sea landings. According to the Soviet Ukrainian newspaper, the railway station, water tower, and other important points in the Tymes district of the Kharkov province were attacked by paratroopers and occupied, while Kakovga in the Nikolaev province, the famous battlefield where the Communist army blocked the advance of White Russian Commander Wrangel in 1920, has once again become a place of military activity. Naval landings and air raids progressed simultaneously, but were repulsed by the defending forces. Thousands of Red Army soldiers also participated in exercises in the Vinnytsia province to prevent large-scale aerial bombardment. There was also a blackout exercise in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. (31st Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Significance of the U.S. Declaration of a State of Emergency <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>After President Roosevelt delivered his "fireside chat" the other day, some people seemed to feel that it was not stimulating enough because the United States was not yet participating in the war or taking actual offensive actions. This is either intentionally belittling the importance of this speech or is due to expectations being too high, resulting in a feeling of inadequacy. In fact, President Roosevelt's declaration of the existence of an unlimited state of emergency was already the greatest action that the head of a non-belligerent country could take within the scope of his powers, and the importance of its significance deserves careful consideration.</p>
<p>Before reviewing the true value of this U.S. development, it is necessary to first understand that the positions mutually adopted by the U.S. and the axis powers are completely different: the U.S.'s anti-aggression policy is based on realistic practical actions, while the tripartite alliance's policy toward the U.S. is mostly a posture of empty threats; because the U.S. has long determined the national policy of "must aid democracy, eradicate aggression, and ensure its own security," it has always been indifferent to how the aggressor countries feel about it, not afraid of what threats the aggressor countries make against it, and even less susceptible to what temptations the aggressor countries offer it. It has always been consistently fearless and undaunted, moving towards its established national policy. Its only problem is how to prepare domestically and how to strengthen itself. It can be said that since the decision to aid democratic countries, through the establishment and implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, until the declaration of a state of emergency yesterday, the U.S.'s anti-aggression policy has always been leaping forward consistently, never turning halfway, and never hesitating for a moment. On the contrary, the tripartite alliance's attitude toward the U.S. has always been only afraid that the U.S. will interfere too actively, so it has always regarded empty threats as the ultimate goal of its actions (although sometimes it still inevitably has some dying attempts at conciliatory diplomacy), not hesitating to come up with various methods, vainly hoping to scare the U.S. away or obstruct and delay the U.S.'s actions. Therefore, the aggression front has been afraid of trouble and afraid of getting into a real fight from the beginning. From the alliance of the three countries until the recent coordination between the authorities of Germany, Japan, and Italy, the only form is intimidation, but they do not dare to directly challenge the U.S. or directly oppose the U.S. Because according to the aggressor countries' own definitions, it seems that the U.S.'s actions to aid various democratic countries have long constituted a reason to declare war on it, but in reality, the allied countries have not only not declared war, but have even abandoned the usual protests, for fear of turning a feigned move into reality and provoking the U.S., which is pragmatic and truly capable. What is ridiculous is that until now, the various allied countries' interpretation of the alliance seems to be still unclear.</p>
<p>Although the U.S.'s proactive position is fundamentally different from the aggression front's intimidating posture, in terms of the nature of the position, the U.S. is ultimately on the passive side, while Germany, Italy, and Japan are on the active side. Therefore, solely on the issue of war or no war, the U.S. must be in a passive position. In other words, the U.S. can at most be on one side waiting in full battle array, while on the other side disregarding everything to push forward its aid policy. Unless the aggression front offends it first, the U.S. will never, and definitely should not, take the initiative to declare war first. Based on this, if the world wants to ask whether the U.S. will fight, it must first ask whether the aggression front truly has the courage and preparation to provoke the U.S. In more concrete terms, it must ask whether Germany is truly prepared to sink U.S. ships when the U.S. escorts them, and whether Japan is truly prepared to invoke the tripartite alliance and respond to Germany and Italy's offensive against Britain in the Far East. Assuming that it is, the U.S., having already declared a state of emergency, indicating its greatest determination, will inevitably fight back without a doubt. Assuming that it is not, then the U.S., only seeking that its aid policy is not hindered, so that various democratic countries can defeat aggression with its support, will of course be happy to continue to maintain its non-belligerent status.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the U.S.'s declaration of a state of emergency is precisely the most proactive move that can be defended and attacked. It shows that the U.S. no longer has a mentality of hoping to be spared by chance, that the U.S. has absolutely no mentality of "fear of war," and that the U.S. will never "retreat in the face of difficulty" because of the intimidation of the aggression front. This attitude comes from a non-belligerent country, can it not be considered to be active to the peak state? Is it not enough to show the U.S.'s selfless and chivalrous spirit?</p>

<p>Chongqing: Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin declared today that China has linked its fate with that of Britain and the United States, and no matter what the situation in Europe may be, China will adhere to its policy and never change. Minister He, in a private interview with a United Press reporter, expressed his belief that Britain, with the aid of the United States, will be able to persevere and will not collapse like France. At worst, it will only be temporarily trapped. Minister He also said that China and the United States have common goals, and President Roosevelt's declaration of unlimited national emergency will not only strengthen the US national defense but also greatly increase aid to countries fighting for self-preservation and independence. President Roosevelt's fireside chat was not only an encouragement to free China, but also a clear support for China's war of resistance, so those who are hesitating in the occupied areas can also gain courage to resist the invaders. President Roosevelt's speech was a severe blow to the puppet regime of Wang Jingwei. Minister He then turned to discuss China's position in resisting aggression. He said that China is a fundamental member of the Sino-British-American alliance, because it has been actively fighting for four years and is still determined to continue until victory. Minister He also answered reporters' questions, saying that in his opinion, if the United States goes to war with Japan, China is willing to allow the United States to use all the airfields and other aviation facilities in China as much as possible during the duration of the war. This does not mean that the US Air Force will be commanded by China, but that China will supply all its aviation facilities for the use of the US Air Force commanded by the United States. On this point, Minister He admitted that he had also heard that American volunteer aviators had joined the Chinese Air Force to fly the American aircraft currently acquired by China, but he declined to comment on this news. Minister He also discussed Sino-British cooperation, saying that if Japan attacks Burma, China will send troops to Burma to help if requested by Britain, but there is currently no such tacit understanding or agreement. Minister He also stated that he is generally satisfied with the amount and type of assistance given to China by the United States. He said that the items needed by China have been sent to Washington and have been approved, and the goods can now be supplied accordingly. Minister He also said that Japan's occupation of the islands has revealed Japan's plan not only to dominate the Pacific but also to threaten the United States and the world. He said that he believed that the United States should recognize this threat. Minister He said, "We have learned that the United States is now focusing on the Atlantic, so the Pacific may not be critical at the moment, but I think from a military point of view, the United States should first solve the Pacific problem. If the United States cannot actively provide us with military assistance at this time, then we can at least expect more material or financial assistance. What China hopes to obtain is heavy artillery, aircraft, and the necessary raw materials for munitions." (31st United Press Special Correspondent Pace dispatch)</p>

<p>London: It was learned last night from London official circles that Iraqi rebel leader Ali Gailani has fled to Iran, accompanied by his staff member Chagi and others. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to reports, Iraqi rebel leader Gailani has fled Baghdad to the north with the young King Faisal II. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Beirut: According to news received here from Baghdad, Iraqi Prime Minister Gailani is inspecting the southern line defenses near Basra. (31st Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London: London announced that the Iraqi rebels have proposed a ceasefire. This request was made by a committee organized by prominent figures from four cities. The committee has ordered the dissolution of military organizations. This ceasefire request follows closely after the rebel leader Ali Gailani fled the country. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Official announcements continued, stating that since Ali Gailani fled Iraq, the committee organized by the mayor of Baghdad, which now rules the city, has requested a ceasefire from the British side. London has not heard about the terms of the ceasefire, but it is known that this request was made in the last 48 hours. According to dispatches from Cairo, British troops arrived on the outskirts of Baghdad on the evening of Friday and invaded the suburbs of the city. London sources emphasized that the German failure to fulfill its promise of assistance to Gailani must have had a significant impact on the heroic achievements of the British troops on Crete, because the British resistance caused the German troops and aircraft originally intended to be transferred to Iraq to be used on the island. Responsible persons here all said that the conflict between the British side and the rebels has become a thing of the past. Now the whole world knows that any dispute in Iraq is not between the Arabs and the British, but between the British and the Germans. What is important now is that Gailani did not obey the instructions of his German masters and fled to Iran. It is reported that Gailani was accompanied by members of his cabinet, the puppet regent, and the German and Italian ministers. The termination of the conflict between the Central Army and the rebels does not mean that there are no traces of German troops in Iraq, and that there are no German aircraft or personnel or conflicts with British troops in the area. Moreover, there is much evidence indicating that the people of Iraq will welcome the return of their legitimate regent, Ilah. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Beirut: Iraqi sources said today that Baghdad has declared itself a demilitarized city. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the outskirts of Baghdad. (31st United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: Rumor has it that after Ali Gailani fled, the new military commander of Baghdad, Seba Hua, who is also the Minister of Economic Affairs, organized a security committee with Baghdad officials and gentry, ordering all irregular groups of a military nature to be dissolved. It is widely expected that the terrifying situation in Baghdad will end soon. Members of all illegal organizations were ordered to surrender their weapons to the police, so they wore civilian clothes. The security committee issued two articles, advising the public to remain calm and abide by discipline. Those who cause disturbances and unrest will be severely punished. Since Gailani seized power, there have often been thugs drawing graffiti, randomly shooting in the streets, and shouting and howling at night. Foreigners dare not go out without police protection and must wear armbands. All embassies have military police protection. At the same time, the water in the lower reaches of the Euphrates River overflowed, causing the Central Army to fail to advance rapidly towards Baghdad. The Iraqi people destroyed the sluice gate. Yesterday, British air squadrons launched multiple strikes to support the British troops attacking Baghdad. Enemy motor transport teams on the Fallujah side were heavily bombed by British aircraft. Italian aircraft were initially discovered in Iraq yesterday. Last night, the British Air Force Communiqué stated that the British aircraft strafed the Baqubah airfield very successfully. Many Italian Fiat fighter planes and other aircraft were destroyed and rendered unusable. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Battle of Crete Reaches a Decisive Stage; Attacked from the East and West by Axis Forces; British Troops Retreat into the Mountains to Set Up Defensive Positions; Allied Commander Freyberg Safe <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>London: Due to frequent reinforcements from the German army, pressing from the east and west, the war-weary British Royal Army has reportedly set up defensive positions in the narrow roads of the Cretan mountains as a last stronghold. However, London has not confirmed the news about the defenders withdrawing from this strategically important island. The British troops withdrawing from Suda Bay have reportedly joined forces with the British troops from Rethymno or Heraklion. However, according to Cairo news, British troops are still holding Heraklion. If the German claim that German troops have reached Rethymno and occupied Heraklion is true, then this news is sufficient to show that most of the main roads along the northern coast must already be in German hands. If the retreat of the British troops has been decided, the British Royal Army will have to go through the mountains to the coast on the south coast, imitating the tactics of the Battle of Dunkirk, and leave the island by ferry. However, it is feared that the British troops at that time will not be able to retreat from Dunkirk under the cover of aircraft like they did when crossing the English Channel last year. According to Cairo news, Australian, New Zealand, British, and Greek troops with bloodshot eyes, tired spirits, and covered in dust are now fighting in the valleys and rugged roads of the mountains, guarding rocky riverbeds, building stone fortresses, and hurriedly setting up machine gun positions to protect the sloping foothills. Clifford, the military correspondent of the "Daily Mail," reported from Cairo that after ten days of uninterrupted hand-to-hand combat, the New Zealand army is almost still fighting automatically. The Greek army, in order to maintain its determination not to surrender, continues to load bullets into its guns and shoots at the enemy, killing one person and then another. However, the Greek army now knows that the loss of soldiers has no impact on the plans of the German high command. A spokesman for the British Air Force in Cairo said that the situation is extremely delicate and serious, and the London newspapers have already hinted that Crete will be lost and have begun to speculate on Hitler's second move. They believe that his second move will be to attack Cyprus. The Daily Mail wrote, "The reason for our failure in the Cretan War is the same as other battles in this war of resistance against the Germans, namely, the lack of equipment. We now anticipate that the Germans will have the same rapid attempt to occupy Cyprus. Only if we abandon illusions and have more artillery, warships, aircraft, and tanks can we defend the island of Cyprus." The Times said, "The future of Crete is even more hopeless." The military correspondent of the Chronicle News declared, "The enemy's strength in the battle of Crete is now more obvious, and its momentum is increasing day by day."

<p>Berlin: The German military communiqué this afternoon stated that the German troops who had been dispatched to Crete were continuing to pursue the enemy eastward, and had made contact with the German paratroopers in Heraklion, and it was hoped that they would soon join forces with the Italian troops advancing westward from the east coast. Yesterday, German bombers attacked enemy concentration areas and enemy retreat routes. The British remnants attempted to escape to British warships from the southern end of the island, so German aircraft bombed the ports on the south coast most fiercely. The British fleet south of Crete encountered bombing, and one destroyer was heavily damaged. (31st Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to the latest news received in London, German troops continued to land on Crete from the air. Apart from the above news, there are very few reports about the truth. According to Alexandria dispatches, British wounded arriving there estimate that German casualties in Crete are between 10,000 and 15,000. It is claimed that 1,500 of the paratroopers were killed on the first day. According to the general opinion of people in London, no matter what happens to Crete, the British action is completely justified. There are two reasons: (1) The British annihilated well-trained German troops and their special equipment; (2) Allowing British troops to clear up the situation in other places.

<p>London: The War Office announced today that the commander of the British forces in Crete, General Freyberg, is still safe and in the army. The German claim that he has died is false. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: With the imminent fall of Crete, the Hamburg Foreign News diplomatic correspondent Halferld yesterday published an article in the newspaper, describing the future political and military importance of the island to Germany, stating in brief: Germany's decision to attack Crete proves that Germany has been able to cope with the military difficulties of fighting on islands. The capture of Crete by Germany and Italy can conquer one of the four pillars of the British Empire's maritime defense in the eastern Mediterranean. These four pillars are Crete, Haifa, Alexandria, and Tobruk. This war in Crete can be regarded as part of a large-scale offensive against the main lifeline of the British Empire. Therefore, Britain tried its best to prevent Germany from occupying the island, not hesitating to allow its fleet to be bombed by German aircraft, in an attempt to salvage the island's crisis. However, the British naval and air forces did not succeed in fighting on the island, and suffered heavy losses. To this day, only the navy can maintain its prestige, but in the battle of Crete, the British navy has also met its match. Britain in the eastern Mediterranean now has Egypt and India as its main bases, with the Suez, Palestine, and other places as its periphery, serving as its last line of retreat.

<h3 id="e43">British Newspaper Reveals Franco-German Collaboration Plan: Darlan Shamelessly Seeks Favor and Honors, Agrees to Offer French Colonies for German Use <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Paris: French Vice-Premier Darlan stated in a speech last night that collaboration with Germany is the fundamental policy of the French government, for if France does not collaborate with Germany today, the nation cannot survive. (Reuter dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London: The contents of the collaboration plan devised by Vichy Deputy Premier Darlan and the agreement established between Hitler and Darlan on May 11th are now detailed in local newspapers. Darlan's plan, drafted by Darlan, Laval, and German representative Abetz in Paris from December 13th of last year to February 25th of this year (the period when Darlan held great power in the Vichy government), is based on France (1) fully acknowledging its defeat in both the mainland and colonies, (2) adhering to the new order established by Hitler, and (3) assisting Germany's victory to the greatest possible extent. In return, Germany will make every effort to secure Darlan's succession to Marshal Pétain as head of France and will grant Darlan the title of First Admiral of Europe. Darlan and Laval have also reached an understanding that once Darlan becomes the head of France, Laval will become the Premier of the French government. As for the Hitler-Darlan agreement of May 11th, it stipulates the concrete stages for implementing Darlan's plan. Some parts of this plan have already been implemented and are visible to all, namely the placement of French munitions and factories under German management, the unrestricted passage of French merchant ships through the British blockade line for Germany, and the transport of German munitions to Africa on French ships. The Syrian aircraft incident is a prelude to the advancement of Darlan's plan. It is rumored that other French colonies will also be made available to Germany when needed by the German command. In his speech on May 23rd, Darlan attempted to explain the reasons for his agreement with Hitler, but some things were left unsaid, and others were expressed ambiguously. In his statement that "Hitler did not ask me for French colonies," the term "colonies" was intended to mislead the world. In French officialdom, the term "colonies" never included mandated territories (such as Syria) or protectorates (such as Tunisia and Morocco). Darlan used this term with two intentions: one, for his future self-defense before the French people, and two, to deceive foreigners such as the British and Americans. On the one hand, he could later defend himself to the French people by saying that what Hitler did not ask for were French colonies, but not French mandated territories and protectorates. On the other hand, he could create a false impression among foreigners that the future of France's general colonies was secure. In reality, one thing is beyond doubt today: Darlan and the Vichy authorities are actively collaborating with Germany and will make Tunisia, Morocco, and Dakar available for German army and air force use when Germany is ready to utilize these locations. Darlan's plan also involves the French navy, but there is no question of transferring it to Germany. Darlan has agreed to assist Germany in the war with French warships and crew in a gradual manner, taking a path of provocation against Britain, hoping that the British and French fleets will eventually break down emotionally and openly engage in battle. Darlan's plan is half implemented and half in preparation. It should be noted that before the end of May 1940, among the three great marshals of the French army, Gamelin, the air force, Vuillemin, and the navy, Darlan's pronouncements were the most vehement in advocating military sanctions against Germany. Unexpectedly, he ultimately sided with defeatists, and the conspiracy behind this will be described in detail later. (Reuter dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Rift Between Britain and France Deepens: Darlan Declares French Territory Inviolable, Accuses Britain of Violating International Law for Bombing Tunisia <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Paris: French Vice-Premier Darlan issued a statement to newspapers in the unoccupied zone this morning, stating that France will no longer tolerate British violations of French territory and insults to the French flag. Following the bombing of the port of Sfax in Tunisia, he is even more determined that French rights must be respected. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the British naval bombardment of the port of Sfax in Tunisia, the local propaganda office recently issued a press release stating, "In defending its bombardment, the British propaganda machine has claimed that Italian merchant ships were discovered near the port or within Tunisian territorial waters. However, this argument has no legal value. It should be known that even if a destroyer of a belligerent country stays in the territorial waters of a neutral country for only a few hours, other belligerent countries have no reason to invade this neutral country. This is because, according to Article 5 of the 1907 Hague International Convention, which both Britain and France jointly participated in, warships of belligerent countries may stay in neutral territorial waters for three periods, each lasting twenty-four hours. Moreover, this event is completely similar to the case of the German warship Admiral Spee. At that time, after the German warship sought refuge in the port of Montevideo in Uruguay, the British fleet complied with the Hague Convention and did not bombard it." (Hava Khan dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>French Forces in North Africa Advance Towards Chad</p>
<p>Vichy: Yesterday, it was stated here that French forces have passed through the Sahara Desert and are advancing towards Lake Chad, the base of the Free French forces led by Tchol, to preserve the integrity of French territory. This news coincides with the German radio report that Germany has promised to strengthen the French National Defense Forces. (Italian radio also claimed that because British aircraft bombed ships in the port of Sfax, General Weygand has ordered the anti-aircraft artillery units in French colonial ports to retaliate.) It also stated that French forces are advancing along the west coast of Chad, encountering no resistance, have occupied Gomi, and have established a radio station there.

<h3 id="e45">Gale Winds and Snow, Raging Waves: A Chronicle of the Anglo-German Naval Battle, British Fleet Pursues for Three Days and Four Nights, Bismarck Finally Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent with the Inland Fleet reported that the journalist witnessed the giant ship battle and the sinking of the German 35,000-ton, so-called unsinkable, new battleship "Bismarck" to the bottom of the sea. The journalist observed the battle from the bridge of a British warship and saw the "Hood" sink only two or three hundred yards away amid a barrage of gunfire. The largest naval battle in this decisive event unfolded between Greenland and Iceland, followed by a pursuit that lasted three days and four nights, ultimately sinking the "Bismarck," which the German fleet boasted about. The "Hood" was a battlecruiser built twenty-one years ago. Shortly after the battle began, it was hit by a shell, immediately catching fire, and exploding fragments flew everywhere, reaching hundreds of feet high. After a few minutes, all that remained was a cluster of thick smoke on the water surface and a few fragments. Shortly after, the German warship "Prinz Eugen" was also hit by a 15-inch shell, with minor damage. This decisive naval battle was initiated when the "Hood" and "Prince of Wales" pursued the "Bismarck" to prevent it from sneaking into the Atlantic to attack convoys. They continuously pursued from outside Iceland, taking advantage of the dim light of the Arctic night. The British cruisers "Norfolk" and "Suffolk" had been tracking the "Bismarck" since it left Bergen, constantly reporting the "Bismarck's" movements to the "Hood" and "Prince of Wales." The sky remained half-lit throughout the night, and by two or three in the morning, it was already dawn, followed by dense fog, a gray gloom like London in the winter afternoon. At times, nothing could be seen a few yards away in the wind and snow sweeping across the sea. It was estimated that around two o'clock in the morning, the British warships should have made contact with the "Bismarck," but the German warship changed course at the last moment. The "Hood" and "Prince of Wales" continued to advance along the line parallel to the enemy warship. The wind and snow intensified. Four hours later, the snow stopped, and it suddenly cleared. Two black dots could be seen on the horizon, namely the "Bismarck" and the cruiser "Prinz Eugen." The British warship then sped forward to shorten the distance with the enemy warship. The enemy warship also turned to face the battle. As they gradually approached, the giant gun at the front of the "Hood" suddenly roared, and orange-yellow fire flashed. Within three seconds, the "Bismarck" also opened fire. The giant guns of the "Prince of Wales" followed with a roar, and yellow smoke filled the air. Shells fell into the sea near the "Hood," shooting water high into the air like springs. The "Hood" continued to advance. Shortly after, it was hit by a shell, which seemed to have landed in front of the 15-inch turret. A huge fire immediately broke out, and thick smoke billowed. Then a loud explosion was heard, and the entire warship was engulfed in flames. Black smoke blotted out the sky, and the smokestack and mast were blasted into the sky. The stern sank, and the bow stood vertically on the surface of the water. After three or four minutes, it completely sank. A British destroyer rushed to the rescue, rescuing only two sailors and one midshipman from the "Hood." The "Prince of Wales" continued to bombard the "Bismarck" fiercely. Then shells exploded near the "Prince of Wales," and the hull suffered minor damage, but its combat effectiveness and speed were not affected at all. The "Bismarck" seized the opportunity to escape, but it was still pursued relentlessly by British warships in the Atlantic that day and the next. At night, the "Prince of Wales" bombarded the "Bismarck" twice. The British warship "Victorious" and "Ark Royal" also sent torpedo planes to attack it. The British warships pursued for three days and four nights, never stopping the attack. Finally, the British warship "Dorsetshire" joined the battle and sank the "Bismarck" with torpedoes. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>A British Port: British naval officers who participated in this decisive Anglo-German naval battle stated that the German elite battleship "Bismarck" did not look like the claimed 35,000 tons in appearance, but seemed closer to 50,000 tons, actually a super-dreadnought. The British warships pursued the warship for a total of 1,750 miles. Along the way, the warship was hit by torpedoes. (United Press Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>Rome: Yesterday's Athens dispatch from the "Piccolo Newspaper" stated, "The German advance on Crete was aided by artificial fog, which, in addition to disorienting the enemy, had a demoralizing effect."

<p>Dublin: Although only three bombs were dropped on Dublin last night, it was learned today that these three bombs killed thirty to forty people, injured over a hundred, destroyed fifty houses, and caused a major fire. At dawn, ten houses were still burning. Since the start of this decisive event, this is the second time Dublin has been bombed, and the eighth time the Irish Free State has been bombed. The United Press Agency reporter's residence was only three hundred yards away from one of the bombed locations, so after hearing the bombing, he got up and went to inspect the scene. He saw women and children wearing only pajamas, crying out in extreme fear. Children were running and shouting for their parents everywhere, and parents were also searching for their children. The nuns of the nearby St. Paul's Orphanage also came out to help, and the air defense personnel and military authorities reunited the scattered families and helped to dig out those who were buried. The orphanage, with three hundred orphans, was undamaged, only shaken. The first bomb fell at 1:40 a.m. on the North Circular Road, destroying three houses and causing a fire. Fifteen minutes later, while the fire brigade was extinguishing the fire, the sound of an air raid siren was heard again. Firefighters and onlookers all lay on the ground. The street was full of glass, as another bomb had fallen nearby, destroying eight houses and burying the people inside. Ten minutes later, another bomb fell on the North Strand. Soldiers, air defense teams, and ambulance teams rushed to the bombed locations. The bombed locations were all within a quarter of a mile of each other. The number of deaths is likely to increase as those buried are dug out, and there is little hope for most of those buried under the rubble. (United Press Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Map Explanation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's report on the map of the Western Hemisphere and the affiliated islands of various countries, the "Lesser Antilles" in the small box should be changed to "Leeward Islands."</p>
<p>The West Indies, also known as the Antilles, extend from the Florida Peninsula in the United States to the coast of Venezuela in South America, guarding the ports of Mexico to the west and forming the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the shape of the island clusters, they are divided into three groups: (1) the Greater Antilles, (2) the Lesser Antilles, and (3) the Bahama Islands. Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico are the Greater Antilles. The islands to the north are the Bahama Islands, and the islands to the southeast are the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>The Lesser Antilles are broadly divided into the Leeward and Windward Islands. The Leeward Islands are located between Puerto Rico and Martinique, occupying the northern part of the Lesser Antilles. Among them, Guadeloupe and the nearby small islands belong to France, and the rest belong to Britain.</p>
<p>The Windward Islands, in addition to the French territory of Martinique, include St. Lucia and Trinidad. Among them, Barbados is an important British naval base in the West Indies. Cape Verde Islands can also be translated as Green Cape Islands.</p>

<h3 id="e49">No Sign of Appeasement Towards Japan: America Guarantees to Accelerate Aid to China, Roosevelt Also Expands Embargo Scope, Woodhead Explains American Foreign Policy <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>British renowned commentator Woodhead commented on President Roosevelt's fireside chat in the English-language "China Press" yesterday, stating briefly that President Roosevelt's recent fireside chat seemed less stern in condemning Japan than in condemning Hitler, leading some to mistakenly believe that the American government seemed to be pursuing a policy of appeasement towards Japan. In reality, this view is greatly mistaken.</p>
<p>Further Intensifying Aid</p>
<p>It should be known that President Roosevelt's speech both paid tribute to China's war effort and guaranteed to further assist the Chongqing government, and predicted that China's defense capabilities would be greatly enhanced, sufficient to resist Japan and help prevent Hitler from dominating the world. Therefore, it can be known that there is absolutely no intention of appeasement.</p>
<p>Embargo on Industrial Raw Materials from the Philippines</p>
<p>Moreover, within hours of President Roosevelt's speech, he extended the export licensing system to the Philippines and immediately banned the export of all raw materials necessary for military industries from the Philippines to Japan, because since Japan joined the Axis powers, it has become a threat to democratic countries. Assuming that appeasement were to occur between the United States and Japan in the future, this appeasement would definitely not be initiated by the United States, but would come from Japan, because the Roosevelt government's foreign policy has never had any intention of appeasement.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's report from the Reuters Washington dispatch, it was said that four mail ships of the American President Lines operating on the Far East route have been requisitioned by the American government as auxiliary warships. These four ships are the President Jackson, the President Adams (both world class), the President Taft, and the President Pierce (both Pacific class), all over 10,000 tons. After the British company Chang Hsing’s Queen Liners were all requisitioned and suspended services last autumn, the American President Lines is now the only line maintaining the Pacific route. Now, after American President Roosevelt delivered a fireside chat declaring the protection of maritime freedom, two of these ships and two world-class mail ships were requisitioned, reflecting that the international situation seems to be trending towards a more tense state. Therefore, Chinese and foreign individuals attach great importance to this move.</p>
<p>No Telegram Received from Head Office</p>
<p>The Ta Chung News Agency reporter visited the local President Lines office yesterday to inquire about the situation. It was said that, as of yesterday, no telegram had been received from the New York head office stating that the four liners had been requisitioned. Whether this statement is true, it is currently impossible to speculate. It is heard that a large number of expatriates from various countries in this city intend to leave Shanghai on the above liners, and the berths on each liner have long been fully booked. If the news of the requisition is indeed confirmed, tickets will inevitably be refunded. For this reason, those who went to the company yesterday to inquire about the truth were particularly crowded, and they were also concerned about whether other liners would be similarly affected. According to the company's staff, before receiving the telegram from the head office, the remaining liners will operate as usual, without a doubt. It is heard that the President Liners currently operating and scheduled to join the service this year, including the world class, total twelve ships. The dedicated ships sailing in the Pacific are the Coolidge, Pierce, Taft, and Cleveland. The Coolidge and Cleveland will arrive in Shanghai soon, departing on a specific date of the fifth and eighth, respectively.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Vietnam Route Will Not Be Halted</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the French mail ship General Joffre was rumored to be unable to sail to Vietnam due to crew disputes. Yesterday (30th), reliable sources were unable to confirm this statement. Furthermore, the Far East General Manager of the French Mail Company, Mr. Kogia, also denied the rumor that the company's fuel ships traveling between Shanghai and Vietnam would be suspended due to a lack of fuel. Mr. Kogia refused to disclose the reason why the General Joffre could not sail. According to authoritative sources, the French Mail Company's fuel ships will indeed be suspended, but the coal-burning ships will continue to operate. According to the company's employees, the company expects to have as many as five ships arriving in Shanghai before June 10th. Therefore, there is no risk of the company's route being completely suspended.</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that, according to news from the French Mail Company, the reason why the General Joffre failed to sail as scheduled the day before yesterday was that the company received a telegram from Saigon, instructing it to suspend operations temporarily. Therefore, it is still berthed at the Blue Funnel Wharf and has not yet left Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association believes that the price of rice in this city is soaring endlessly, and it is particularly difficult for the poor to find food. Therefore, in February of this year, it opened a congee kitchen at the original site of the Tzu Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road. When the association opened the kitchen, it originally planned to close it after February. However, because the number of poor people sipping congee is increasing daily, it has been decided to extend it for a few more months before making a final decision. However, since the kitchen opened, the number of poor people sipping congee has averaged around 2,000 per day. In the past few days, the number of congee sippers has suddenly increased to more than 4,000.</p>

<p>The smaller taxi companies in this city, including Yi Tai Hua, Li Mei Hua, Jiang Su, You Ning, and Shi Jie, a total of eighteen companies, had an overall driver strike that has lasted for a week since midnight on the 25th of last month. It is now learned that when labor and management conducted negotiations at 10 a.m. yesterday, with repeated concessions, the management agreed to (1) rice subsidy: If Saigon No. 2 rice ranges from $30 to $70, an increase of $3 will be added for every $10 increase; if it exceeds $70, an increase of $5 will be added for every $10 increase, (2) cost of living allowance: calculated as 75% of the rice subsidy. Therefore, some taxi companies, such as Yi Tai, Mei Hua, and Jiang Su, announced the resumption of work at 1 p.m. yesterday. Other taxi companies, such as You Yi and Da Kang, have not resolved the labor unrest because labor and management did not attend the negotiations yesterday. It is expected that it can be resolved satisfactorily in the next day or two. Also,</p>
<p>The yarn socks dyers had once gone on strike to demand improved treatment. After negotiations between labor and management, a satisfactory solution was reached yesterday. Those with monthly wages above $20 will receive a 50% increase, and those below $20 will receive a 60% increase. For dyeing yarn socks of various colors, all original wages will be increased by 50%. For dyeing yarn, based on the original wage standard, $2 will be added for each piece priced at $2, $2 will also be added for pieces priced at $3, $1.6 will be added for pieces priced at $4, $1 will be added for pieces priced at $5, and 10% will be added for pieces priced at $6 and above. The above measures will take effect starting today (1st).</p>

The Germans carried out organized massacres in their air raids on the island, as if a sewing machine sews from one side to the other, bombing back and forth endlessly, turning the three cities into nothing but ruins. All the women and children who fled were brutally killed by machine gun fire, and finally, they set them on fire to complete their work of destruction. This situation did not spare even hospitals and ambulances.</p>

<p>In the latter half of May, the price of small refined rice per shih fell from a peak of 143 yuan on May 3rd to below 110 yuan, the price set by the Public Works Department for Hong Kong rice per shih. Prices for other types of rice also fell simultaneously. However, the average rice price for the month was much higher than in April and at the end of May. This was because the Public Works Department's foreign rice only began retail sales on May 17th, and prices in the first half of the month were also high.</p>
<p>Price of Goods Increased, Fuel Slightly Decreased</p>
<p>Some items this month, such as flour, coal briquettes, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, local cloth, and soap, loosened along with the fall in rice prices. However, the prices of fish, meat, vegetables, lard, and salt rose significantly. Therefore, the average price fluctuation for the month was still higher than last month. The overall index rose from 732.7 yuan last month to 802.68, an increase of 69.89 points. Among the classified indices, the food index rose from 815.09 to 923.18, an increase of 108.09 points. Clothing increased from 534.74 to 556.03, an increase of 21.29 points. Miscellaneous items increased from 726.70 to 747.18, an increase of 20.48 points. However, the fuel index slightly decreased, falling from 759.54 to 757.85, a decrease of 1.69 points. The purchasing power of national currency fell from 1 jiao 3 fen 6 li 5 hao last month to 1 jiao 1 fen 9 li 6 hao this month. The average retail price of japonica rice in May was 135 yuan 2 jiao 2 fen 2 li per shih. Rice (using the price of No. 2 Saigon rice as a substitute) was 103 yuan 9 jiao 3 fen 2 li per shih.</p>
<p>Minimum Living Expenses</p>
<p>The following figures represent the actual income of the head of a working-class family and other family members, as well as other income in the household. The meaning of actual income refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of the income distribution of working-class families and living expenses in May. The table below shows how much income is needed to maintain a lifestyle below that of 1936 (i.e., living standard A) and a minimum standard of living (i.e., living standard B) under two assumed levels of living.</p>
<p>Note: This index is based on the living standards of workers in 1936 before the war. Recently, with the cost of living rising and living standards falling, the increase in expenses in May of this year, in terms of the degree of reduction, was 6.44 times.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Rice Registration Aims to Eliminate Manipulation <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly stabilize the food supply for Shanghai citizens and prevent the transfer of rice and grain to other areas and eliminate hoarding, the authorities of the two concessions have ordered the Rice Industry Association to register all imported foreign rice. According to sources from the Rice Industry Association yesterday morning, the registration form is in triplicate. When rice merchants register with the authorities, they must fill it out in the prescribed format. It is said that one copy will be kept by the rice merchant, one copy will be kept by the authorities for verification, and one copy will be submitted to the ordering foreign firm or the warehouse. Currently, the Rice Industry Association has not yet informed its member firms of the measures and will implement them after joint deliberation. This measure is indeed the only effective way to stabilize the food supply and prevent the transfer of rice and grain to other areas. All rice merchants and citizens should provide practical assistance, and Rice Industry Committee members should not refuse. Furthermore, the types of rice to be registered by the authorities are limited to Saigon rice. As for the dozen or so foreign firms under the supervision of the Import Committee of the French Municipal Council last month, which usually deal in Vietnamese foreign rice, the authorities intend to order them to also register the Vietnamese foreign rice they ordered previously that has not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Selling Deceptively</p>
<p>Since various rice shops in this city have been selling Rangoon special small refined rice supplied by the Hong Kong government at a price of only 110 yuan per shih (160 city catties), which is vastly different from the price of rice sold by local rice merchants every day, some rice shops selling Hong Kong rice have boldly changed the bags and tried to sell it deceptively in the market, attempting to transfer it to other areas for profit, which is worthy of attention.</p>

The amount robbed was estimated to be 2.5 million yuan in legal tender, which is unprecedented since the first robbery case in Shanghai. Usually, the savings received by the bureau from various households in the city every week must be collected and sent to the Zhengzheng Reserve Gold Exchange Bureau on Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road every Saturday. If the amount is too large, the bureau will notify the exchange bureau to send personnel to escort the money.</p>
<p>Armed Escort</p>
<p>Before the incident yesterday, the bureau transferred a total of 2.5 million yuan, including all remittances and savings, to the exchange bureau as usual. It also notified the exchange bureau to send Wang Xufu, the director of the cashier department, and two armed bodyguards to escort the money.

After the police were notified, they immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to guard the area and strictly search for the car's whereabouts.

According to reports, Pan Da announced earlier this week that he had consulted with the five major gambling venues in the Western District and had no difficulty ordering them to close on May 31st. However, as of last night, the gambling venues in the Western District were still open and gambling was proceeding as usual, with no sign of imminent closure.</p>

Those industries that have not organized groups should be urged to organize as soon as possible to carry out this undertaking.

<h3 id="e76">Competition in Jinghua Primary School: The Strike Wave Expands, Authorities Closely Monitor <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) All faculty and staff of Jinghua Primary School on Haifang Road previously presented four demands to the school administration. After four weeks without a satisfactory response, they initiated a strike several days ago (the 30th), as reported by various newspapers. According to inquiries from a Dahua News Agency reporter, the school administration has intensified its pressure, exacerbating the situation. (1) Yesterday, primary school teacher Wang Shiwei witnessed students lingering on the street, with heavy traffic posing a danger. While advising the students to leave, he was suddenly attacked by middle school teacher Liang Zhishen, who, without inquiring into the circumstances, punched and kicked him, causing him to lose consciousness for three hours on the spot. (2) The school administration forcibly ordered male and female teachers residing on campus to vacate the premises within a specified time, threatening to use force otherwise. (3) The school administration engaged funeral parlor staff to mediate, but the proposed terms were too far apart, implementing purely coercive measures and demanding signatures by a certain time in the afternoon, threatening to hire new teachers otherwise. (4) The school administration deployed a large number of personnel to monitor the movements of faculty and staff, completely depriving them of their freedom. Currently, the faculty and staff are fighting for their rights based on reason. Furthermore, according to Dahua News Agency, educational personnel throughout the city expressed outrage upon hearing the news, unanimously condemning the school authorities for rejecting mediation initially and then daring to oppress the teachers subsequently, deeming it utterly inappropriate. It is reported that relevant authorities are still closely monitoring future developments to find a solution to the deadlock.</p>
<p>Another report states that Jinghua Middle and Primary School issued a statement yesterday, claiming that although a few members of the teachers' union instigated a strike at the private Jinghua Middle and Primary School on Haifang Road, all classrooms in the school continued to hold classes as usual yesterday (the 31st) because the other teachers were deeply aware of righteousness, complied with the school's measures, and attended classes as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Sino-Western Cup Table Tennis Women's Group: Jewish Team Wins Championship <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Cup women's group table tennis final was held at the Jewish Club on Muer Ming Road at 7:30 PM the night before last. Over a hundred guests attended, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Chen Linsheng, the executive chairman of the association, as well as committee members Di Fei, Liang Tang, Fulutuo, and Shasijin, all attended and presided over the event. The competitors were the defending champion Hualian and the third-place Jewish team from the previous year. The former boasted numerous fierce players and had defeated the talented Women's Youth team twice, with unmatched strength in Shanghai. The latter possessed the chop-block expert Mrs. Di Fei and the newcomer Miss Su Lun, but the overall team lineup was not yet complete. They had even succumbed to the Women's Youth team once last week. It was expected that the Jewish team would face an uphill battle tonight. Unexpectedly, after two hours of intense competition, Hualian lost due to Xu Haili and Xiao Weiqing's poor performance, losing every match and affecting the overall situation. Furthermore, Cai Xiuyu underestimated her opponent in the first game and was defeated by Ai Xuanjier. The forehand specialist Yan Wenjun was timid and lost a match she could have won. Considering the overall team, only the captain Miss Lin Jinlan performed exceptionally well. Her forehand shots were steady, accurate, and powerful, with near-perfect accuracy, making her difficult to defend against even for Jewish team's main player Mrs. Di Fei, resulting in a perfect record of five wins. This was truly commendable. In terms of skill, Hualian was superior, making this defeat regrettable. As a result, the Jewish team defeated Hualian by a score of 13 to 19, winning this year's championship. The Hualian team must wait until next year to avenge their defeat and should practice more diligently. We have high hopes for them. The results of both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jewish Team Wins Losses</p>

<p>(3) Occurrence of Life Phenomena</p>
<p>Animals ingest food and inhale air, undergoing gasification processes to decompose the food, converting the potential energy in the food into kinetic energy to stimulate various bodily activities and generating life phenomena.</p>
<p>(4) Individual Survival and Species Perpetuation</p>
<p>Animals ingest nutrients, increase physical strength, respond to external stimuli, and adapt to external environments to maintain individual survival. However, the lifespan of animals is limited, and death is inevitable. Therefore, after individual development and maturation, they separate a portion of the living substance from their bodies, forming a gamete to perpetuate the species.</p>
<p>(5) Animal Body Systems</p>
<p>A. Radial symmetry: The body has no anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, or left-right directions. From one end of the body, passing through the body axis to the other end, it can be divided into many equal halves.</p>
<p>B. Bilateral symmetry: Starting from the animal's mouth, along the dorsal-ventral center to the anus, there is only one plane that can divide the body into equal halves.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Finance: Tight Foreign Exchange <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC exchange rates. In the black market, the British and American exchange rates were stable but slightly soft. Although Chinese speculators over-sold, HSBC and other foreign banks suddenly absorbed the supply, causing the US dollar rate of 5.40625 yuan to suddenly become difficult to settle, softening to 5.375 yuan. The British pound also hardened to 3 shillings 328125 pence, but the Hong Kong telegram rate settled back to 3 shillings 3125 pence, the same as the previous closing price. The US dollar was tighter by 0.03125 yuan, with thin trading. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>British Pound Unchanged</p>
<p>According to morning foreign exchange reports, during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, the British pound reported long, and the American and Indian silver markets were flat. Among the exchange rates of various countries, only the US dollar against Shanghai was slightly down by two points, with the rest flat. The opening price of the central exchange rate remained unchanged. The opening selling price of spot US dollars was still firm at 3 shillings 328125 pence, with the US dollar flat at 5.40625 yuan. Speculators initially bid at the same price but were unsuccessful. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax rose by half a point. After calculating the levy of 24.25 percent, speculators bid less on the June contract at 5.375 yuan, soon offsetting it at 5.40625 yuan, so it returned to being difficult to sell and settle. It was reported that HSBC absorbed the June contract at 5.40625 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram rate bid for the British pound at 3 shillings 3125 pence, signaling further softening. The spot rate to the June contract was all British pounds at 3 shillings 3125 pence and US dollars at 5.375 yuan, the same as the previous closing rate (29th). The British pound was flat, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar Rises</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 31st (Saturday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot Hong Kong dollar rose by 50 cents to 4.52 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market continued to be firm amid stability. Due to the softening of foreign exchange, remittance merchants Da Feng, Xin Feng, and Yong Chong came to sell short again, and the Guangdong group added to the positions, leading to an opening price of 6,405 yuan amid chaos, which once rose to 6,432 yuan. However, gold certificate groups then began to sell, and there were also rumors of sales by the Shanghai West group. The supply and demand situation turned balanced, and the price hovered around 6,420 yuan, eventually rising by 13 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 20,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. As of the end of the month yesterday, 14,220 taels of the May contract had not been settled and were settled and squared at 6,479.10 yuan, based on the HSBC small counter US dollar exchange rate of 5.375 yuan.

The June US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.40625 yuan. Shi He, Heng Ji, and Xin Feng Yong then continued to buy, raising it by 17 yuan, and De Da advanced to 6,432 yuan. Soon, Shi He and Cheng Ji sold again, and De Fu also sold, hovering around 6,420 yuan, once falling back to 6,415 yuan.

<h3 id="e87">Food: Foreign Rice Arrives by Ship, One After Another, Rice Prices Fluctuate and Rebound <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice is arriving in Shanghai in succession. The French company has had three consecutive arrivals, all with foreign rice. The Tingkai ship, arriving yesterday morning, brought over 20,000 bags directly from Saigon, docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Today, the French ship G.G.A. Varenns, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived, also carrying 3,050 tons, or 30,500 bags, of rice from Saigon. The Java Company's Chisesdanny mail ship arrived the day before yesterday, carrying over 23,000 bags of corn from Java. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 4,346 bags of corn from Hong Kong, docked at Jifu Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>Prices first rose and then fell, and the market entered a state of fluctuation. The transaction of foreign rice is still active, with price fluctuations of two to three yuan. There are fewer futures transactions, with fluctuations of only around one yuan. Initially, it was hoped that there would be a large number of local customers making purchases after the festival, and mainland customers continued to inquire about prices in the market. The selling prices of various types of rice immediately gradually increased, rising by two to three yuan. Grade 1 Saigon rice rose to as high as 127 yuan, Grade 2 and Xiaojiao rice rose to 122 yuan, Mindang rice rose to 125-6 yuan, 砟 rice rose to 118 yuan, and broken rice rose to 97 yuan. However, as soon as the market price rose, actual sales slowed down, and profitable floating traders immediately sold. Moreover, in addition to the newly arrived foreign rice, including the French company's ships, with an import of 50,000 to 60,000 bags, there are two or three more ships arriving in succession. Hong Kong rice continues to be transported and sold to the public, and the third batch of tribute rice will also begin to be sold. Therefore, confidence returned, and prices immediately fell by one to two or three yuan. The final result is still close to the previous market closing price. The total transaction volume of current rice is 13,000 to 14,000 bags, with the British-Chinese company's transaction volume being 600 to 700 tons. Prices initially rose but weakened, with little net change. The spot price of Grade 1 Saigon rice is 146 yuan to 145 yuan, the April-May price is 146.5 yuan, the June price of Xiaojiao rice is 146 yuan, the April-May price is 140 yuan to 141.5 yuan, and the May price of broken rice is 107.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<p>— Feng Liuxing</p>
<p>Price Statistics (2)</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this training work inadvertently caused various newspapers to add special sections on commercial and financial news, unintentionally creating many correspondents who were both familiar with commercial information and capable of writing. This was indeed an unexpected gain for various newspapers. For example, the Commercial Newspaper, which first opened a commercial and financial news section in the Shanghai Chinese newspaper industry in January of the tenth year of the Republic of China, and the Economic News section of the Xinwen Newspaper, which followed suit in April of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, as well as the Commercial News section of the Shen Bao, the correspondents when they were first opened were mostly drawn from the investigators of the Price Investigation Office, and it is still feared that quite a few are still among them. Later, the commercial news of various newspapers all followed suit, establishing a separate field. Thus, people in various industries were influenced and learned from each other, and the number of people writing commercial articles gradually increased. This has its own considerable relationship to the progress of industrial and commercial culture, which is not known to recent people, so it is mentioned here.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the Paris Peace Conference was held in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and Zhang Jizhi, as the leading figure in China's industrial sector, considered abandoning the opportunity to lift the restrictions of China's agreed tariff and gain tariff autonomy. He then contacted Shanghai merchants to organize a Tariff Equality Association, but did not dare to openly call for autonomy, for fear of offending merchants from various countries. However, in order to seek tariff autonomy, there must be a self-determined tariff, preceded by a self-conducted investigation of cargo prices. In this way, the newly established Cargo Price Investigation Office suddenly attracted the attention of large merchants in Shanghai. However, various countries who had already gained economic benefits in China were unwilling to give them up easily, especially in the era of warlords, who were even less likely to pay attention to them. Therefore, although there was a representative who went to Europe to prepare to present something to the Peace Conference, it ultimately returned without result. At that time, the business community did not know the importance of tariff autonomy, and some even wanted to take advantage of the low import tax rates to facilitate profit-seeking; therefore, the work of the Cargo Price Investigation Office was no longer valued by the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>Initially, the investigation was limited to the imported foreign goods, converting all kinds of trading units into dan and converting them into Customs Taels. Under the conditions of an inexperienced investigative work, this was naturally very difficult, as it required opening up a road for work. After completing the monthly compilation and reporting quarterly to the Ministry of Finance, the revised tariff in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, still headed by Cai Tinggan, adopted this price as the basis for calculating tariffs. However, foreigners still said that it was not publicized at ordinary times, so in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, they began to compile and publish a quarterly Chinese and English cargo price, followed by a monthly price report, along with conducting commodity surveys and industry surveys. This survey is still advocated today, but it is not known that the Cargo Price Investigation Office was already working on it at that time.</p>
<p>The term "Index Number" was translated by the Japanese. It was originally unseen in China, but in fact, it is not difficult to explain in terms of the meaning of the word. Whenever there is a place that needs to be indicated, a hand is drawn holding a fist, with one finger pointing as an indication, and below it may be attached with words such as "Enter Here" or "Turn Here". This index finger, which holds a fist and points straight, is what is called an Index, containing the meaning of indication. Therefore, an index is a group of numbers that take a little bit of compilation work to become one or several numbers to indicate its trend of ups and downs, so that it is easy to compare and observe! In other words, this is the number that indicates whether the price "is high because of this" or "is small because of this". I do not want to talk about the definitions of indexes here, but for the sake of understanding by the general readers, I will use metaphors to prepare for one explanation!</p>
<p>China's price index began in September of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919) with the Shanghai Wholesale Price Index of the Cargo Price Investigation Office. Because the investigation was accurate and the compilation was detailed, the statistical publications of various countries soon contained the words "China" or "Shanghai", which is also the glory of China's academic community. The office also compiled and issued an import and export price index in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China; and in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the first cost of living index in Shanghai was also published.</p>
<p>Following the Cargo Price Investigation Office, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau was responsible for statistical work. Each department of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau has statistics, such as public welfare and charitable undertakings, industry and commerce, and labor affairs. What is mentioned here is only the workers' cost of living index compiled by the labor department. Cai Zhengya presided over this and first conducted a family budget survey of workers, followed by compiling an index, which was published in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13 Incident, various indexes have been suspended one after another due to the relationship of the compilation agencies, which is a pity. The International Labour Office still needs the Shanghai workers' cost of living index, and Shanghai society has never been without this need. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of the China Statistical Society came out to plan, not to cause the workers' cost of living index to be interrupted due to the temporary situation. It reluctantly raised part of the survey expenses, and Cai Zheng continued to be responsible for the compilation. Soon, the funds ran out, and the Shanghai Municipal Council maintained it with the strength of a certain four people, which is also called the Shanghai Municipal Council Workers' Cost of Living Index by various newspapers. However, the base period has been changed from the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926) to the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (that is, 1936, the year before the Shanghai war) as the standard.</p>
<p>China's price index originated in Shanghai; and Tianjin's price index began with He Lian. He returned to China from studying statistics with Professor Fisher in the United States and arrived in Shanghai in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. After that, he went to Nankai University as a professor, and then Tianjin began to have a price index in the world. Since then, although the compilation of price indexes in various provinces and cities has been carried out and stopped, there must be no less than thirty or forty kinds, but only more than a dozen kinds have continued to be compiled, and most of them are probably in suspension today.</p>
<p>Although I have never peeped into the doorway of statistics, I am also secretly happy to sort out the numbers and make simple statistics to help explain things. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, I compiled a foreign exchange index by month based on the foreign exchange since the beginning of the Republic of China, up to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, which was published in the New Year's Day supplement of the Commercial Newspaper in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Now the original manuscript is lost, and the Commercial Newspaper also ceased publication at the end of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, and the old newspaper cannot be retrieved.</p>
<p>Before China compiled its own price index, foreigners such as the Englishman Wetmore and the Japanese Currency System Committee had compiled Chinese price indexes, but the source of their prices was probably only within the scope of trade books. Now, the methods of compiling indexes are progressing very rapidly, with different categories and different methods. It has become a specialized subject, which cannot be compared with the simple compilation of the past. Recently, the classification methods of the cost of living index have also tended to change from the current five categories (namely, food, clothing, rent, fuel, and miscellaneous) to four categories (namely, food, housing, clothing, and miscellaneous). When this decisive battle is over, all economic organizations will undergo tremendous changes, and since the price index is a manifestation of economic life, how can there be no reason to reform it! (The End)</p>
<p>Corrigendum: The difficulty of proofreading is like sweeping fallen leaves. Unexpectedly, there are errors in the original manuscript in this article that have been reversed, such as "foreign goods originally wanted to be sold in China, which is beneficial to light taxes" and mistakenly written as "which is beneficial to heavy taxes", which was not proofread. In addition, errors such as "conceal" being mistakenly written as "蕴瞒" are minor. Other errors, if they can be understood, will not be corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Miscellaneous Grains: Fresh Green Broad Beans Hit the Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Fresh green broad beans, favored by the recent sunny weather, are arriving on the market in sequence. This year, due to changing circumstances, the Nanxiang (Minhang area) supply has yet to reach the market. For the past two days, the supply has come from the Beigang (Maojiashi area), numbering around 200 bags. The quality is higher than last year, and the selling price is also sharply higher, almost double. (On May 31st of the tenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1921], the first batch of green broad beans from Nanxiang, Minhang, was priced at 19.5 yuan; the second batch on June 1st opened at 19 yuan; on June 3rd, the first batch of green broad beans from Beigang, Maojiashi, was priced at 20.08 yuan, and the second batch ranged from 20 yuan to 19.5 yuan.) The opening price is 42 yuan to 42.2 yuan, purchased by the Hong Kong group and local traders. Subsequent batches, under these special circumstances, are likely to rise further, with little chance of falling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,488 bags of tea beans arrived from Tianjin. On June 2nd, 724 bags of beans, 2,000 pieces of bean cake, and 250 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e89">New Wheat Samples Arrive; Flour Sales Showing Signs of Activity <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market was particularly firm, likely due to increasing sales both north and south. Suppliers were reluctant to release stock, making it difficult to buy. The general market price for "Pao Tai" brand American flour opened at 30.035 yuan, "Jin Long" flour at 29.9 yuan, and "Hua Niao" brand at 30.05 yuan. Transactions amounted to a strong 10,000 bags, and the market consensus was stable and firm.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market was as quiet as usual, as old wheat had already been cleared and new wheat had not yet arrived. Factories had not yet begun sourcing raw materials, and buying and selling were in a period of clearing accounts, with trading largely suspended.</p>
<p>New Wheat: New wheat has already appeared in the Xisu (Wuxi and Suzhou) area and will soon be officially weighed and priced. Samples have also been sent to Shanghai, and the quality is similar to last year, but the harvest is estimated to be only 80% of last year's.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Securities: Bond Market Shows Mixed Performance <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds (unofficial market): Yesterday's market, being a Saturday, saw only half-day trading. Prices showed mixed performance, with no uniformity. Different participants took different positions, resulting in fluctuations. The overall trend was still upward. Xinfu and Hengkang were actively buying, Defu exclusively bought Ding bonds, and Tongkang Lianyi sold Ding bonds. Supply was limited, so the price increased significantly. The remaining bonds fluctuated by only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Transactions totaled 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of the Home Industries Cooperative were traded at 95 yuan per share.</p>
<p>London: May 30th (Friday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British company stocks saw slight increases.

<h3 id="e91">Yarn and Cotton: Shuang Ma Factory Inventory Depleted; New Shorts Hesitant <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains calm, but actual trading is still holding, so sentiment is stable. However, some in the market say that a large number of foreign client orders have been mostly cleared, leading to a mediocre trend. As for shorts, they dare not take aggressive action because the factory order supply is depleted and they suffered significant losses last time. Thus, the market is in a state of hesitation. The fundamental issue is that real sales continue, and with factories' production costs increasing, market prices naturally cannot fall significantly. The high price for 20-count "Shuang Ma" yarn was 1,445 yuan, and the low price was 1,434 yuan. No transactions were reported in the afternoon due to the weekend. Tomorrow, 2,400 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening market for "Shuang Ma" yarn was peaceful, with the first trade at 1,440 yuan, rising slightly to 1,445 yuan. The bidding market was also ordinary. Foreign exchange rates showed no major changes. Major players generally adopted a cautious attitude, and activity was limited, making trading very quiet. Those who profited midway sold, pushing the price down to 1,434 yuan. With the price low, it is said that some foreign clients bought in slightly, and at the same time, bids increased, pushing the price back up to 1,445 yuan. However, new buyers were not eager, and the price lingered around 1,440 yuan for a long time. The closing price was flat at 1,437 yuan. According to statistics, 7,600 bales were traded during the half-day, with Hong Kong interests accounting for 600 bales and domestic interests accounting for 7,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Cotton Cloth Still Good <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is generally firm, as yarn sales are more active compared to rice. It is expected that factories may intend to replenish their raw material supplies, which is boosting confidence. The public is still optimistic about the prospects for fine cotton. Tomorrow, 270 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market in Shanghai is quiet but firm. At the same time, due to continued caution from various parties, transactions are scarce.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose due to climate reports favorable to bulls. At the same time, it fell due to some profit-taking and the impact of the Balkan Crete Island war. As a result, the closing price was down 12-13 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering, but later fell due to weaker overseas markets and the European war. Yesterday's closing prices were down 3-4 rupees across the board.</p>
<p>It is predicted that today's opening market will be fairly flat, similar to the closing prices.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Piece Goods: Both Spot and Futures Cloth Prices Fall <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was very weak, with both spot and futures prices falling nearly 100 yuan. In addition, one firm in the Xinghua group with weak capital was stranded. This is the first case of bankruptcy after sugar became a speculative commodity. Although the amount is only around 20,000 yuan, the future needs to be watched carefully. The guild's listed price for spot second-grade white sugar arriving on May 14th was 98.5-98.65 yuan, and that arriving on May 30th was 99.5 yuan. The June futures market opened soft and flat at 101-100 yuan, then fell to 99.9-98.6 yuan, down 2.9 yuan.

<h3 id="e99">Who Is the Next Edison? <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Edison, a great American inventor, is known to everyone and admired by all.</p>
<p>He invented over a thousand different things in his lifetime. The happiness he gave to people will be forever praised.</p>
<p>However, he was not born special. When he was young, he enjoyed playing as much as you do, but he also liked to study science, paying attention to new things at all times, constantly asking questions and getting to the bottom of things. He often experimented himself, and sometimes the experiments failed, but he was not discouraged and continued to try again and again until he succeeded. Therefore, his great achievements were entirely the result of his own hard work. He often said to people, "My achievements all come from hard work and effort."</p>
<p>Dear children! When you enjoy the things he invented, how should you admire him and emulate him? Children! As long as you cultivate a scientific mindset now, use your clever minds to explore nature, and use your capable hands to engage in scientific experiments, then you will be the next Edison!</p>
<h3 id="e100">Superstitions of the Dragon Boat Festival <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>Time flies so quickly; spring has quietly passed, and summer has arrived. The Dragon Boat Festival is a rather noticeable event in early summer. Fruit shops are piled high with golden loquats, and tea shops display all kinds of zongzi (rice dumplings). Leaves resembling wild grass hang in front of neighboring doors, with garlic attached. All these things appearing on the Dragon Boat Festival day in A Liang's simple mind, he doesn't know why.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll tell you one by one?" When A Liang's father saw A Liang's puzzled expression, he said to him like this. Of course, A Liang was overjoyed when he heard that his father was willing to explain everything to him. He quietly waited for his father to open his mouth.</p>
<p>"The origin of zongzi is said to be in the ancient state of Chu in our country, there was a great poet named Qu Yuan, who everyone knew at that time. One day, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Miluo River because he was worried about the country. Therefore, the local people wrapped zongzi to commemorate him. The day Qu Yuan jumped into the river was exactly the fifth day of the fifth month, so eating zongzi on the Dragon Boat Festival has the meaning of commemorating Qu Yuan. This thing is still somewhat meaningful. And the most superstitious is the legend of eliminating the five poisonous creatures—snakes, centipedes, spiders, geckos, and toads—on the Dragon Boat Festival. What is used to eliminate them? It is the artemisia, calamus, and garlic hung on the door because calamus is like a sword that can kill them; while artemisia and garlic have a pungent smell that can be used to scare them away. Do you think this kind of thinking is naive and ridiculous? Even more, at noon that day, people drink realgar wine, which is said to detoxify snake bites and insect stings. The most boring thing is to dress up children in strange costumes, wearing fire-yellow clothes printed with tigers, and fire-yellow shoes and socks on their feet. The shoes are even embroidered with tiger whiskers, ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. A string woven with camphor bags, yellow tigers, riding figures, and horn zongzi is hung on the buttons, which is said to have the effect of suppressing evil. The character 'king' is drawn on the forehead with realgar to detoxify. At noon, mosquito coils are burned in every room, so that the traces of poisonous insects can be eliminated. The Dragon Boat Festival is the time when fire-yellow color is most prominent. Even the food eaten is chosen to be yellow, so loquats, yellow croaker, cucumbers, and yellow eels must be eaten that day. Some are yellow in color, and some only have the name without the substance. Thinking about these things carefully, even fools would not do them, but now they are being moved and handled one by one by people who consider themselves smart. These are all meaningless and superstitious things. Moreover, there is still the custom of giving gifts on the Dragon Boat Festival. Given the current high cost of living, gifts are really unaffordable. A simple gesture costs dozens of yuan. Besides, sending gifts back and forth still results in everyone eating their own food, a pointless waste of money. Then why bother? There is also the legend of the White Snake, in which the White Snake reveals her true form on the Dragon Boat Festival. This is even more vulgar and disgusting nonsense. Could there really be such stupid things in the world? It really should be banned. So this Dragon Boat Festival is truly full of smog and foul air. However, we should purify our minds and abolish these unreasonable and superstitious actions one by one. This is a meaningful task that modern children should do." A Liang felt that this was very true after listening to these words, so he wanted to explain it to his relatives one by one to break the various superstitions of the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Little Angels Overseas <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Children! Don't you often like to listen to people telling stories or jokes? Now I have a very interesting thing to tell you all.</p>
<p>In New York, in the United States, there is a girl named Reidie Hanson who is only two years old. However, her monthly income exceeds the salary of her father as a middle school science teacher, and she already has a huge sum of money in the bank. Children must be asking me, where does she get so much income from? It turns out that since this little angel was two months old, her photos have been used as cover material by some magazines, and some have been published in newspapers as advertising promotions. In fact, it is because her face is so beautiful, and she looks even more moving after being photographed. So until today, almost all the larger magazines or newspapers published in the United States can have her photos found. Of course, her photos cannot be taken arbitrarily. First, the consent of her parents must be obtained, and secondly, if it is used for promotion, some remuneration must be given to this little angel. Recently, the average weekly remuneration she receives is at least sixty or seventy US dollars. The most interesting thing is that she refuses to have crying photos taken, but she likes to sleep in front of the camera the most.</p>
<p>Children! Do you all feel envious of this little angel?</p>
<h3 id="e102">Spanking the Palm <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— He Yichang</p>
<p>The room I live in faces the window of a small school next door. That window is a classroom. Every day, the sound of students reading, singing, and making noise fills my ears. Sometimes, there is a special sound of slapping, which is 'spanking the palm.' Then there is the teacher's scolding and the students' crying, all mixed together. This kind of sound can be heard every day. Sometimes it continues incessantly, one after another. Although I am used to hearing it, I always feel a strange feeling in my heart, often sighing: 'Children, why are you getting beaten? Why does your good flesh have to suffer such pain?' According to educational principles, 'corporal punishment' is prohibited in schools. Spanking the palm is also a kind of corporal punishment. But according to some teachers, elementary school students are always mischievous, and in some places, they simply cannot be successful without beating. Therefore, corporal punishment is common in almost all elementary schools. And spanking the palm has become the most common corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Children, if you are subjected to this kind of corporal punishment, you should also reflect on yourselves and learn from the pain. What is the reason for suffering this pain? In my opinion, there are about two reasons: First, not listening to instructions. Unwilling to study diligently, forgetting what has been taught, and failing to submit prepared assignments on time. Second, not following the rules. Flippant and glib, often teasing and fighting with classmates. Or damaging other people's books, or stealing other people's items. If you commit any of the above problems, of course you are qualified to be beaten. Therefore, children, whether in school or at home, you must obey instructions and follow the rules. Every day, you must ask yourselves, have I done anything wrong today? If you have, then correct it; if you haven't, then continue to strive.' Then the 'ruler' placed on the teacher's desk, although it hits people at every turn, I am afraid it will have no way to use its skills, and there will be 'no place to display its strength.'</p>
<h3 id="e103">Three Ordinary Questions <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Qing</p>
<p>"First, why can we only see the air we exhale when it's cold?"</p>
<p>The air we exhale from our lungs is always the same temperature; but the change in the outside air is very large. When the weather is cold, the temperature of the air we exhale is higher than the temperature of the outside air, so as soon as it leaves our body and suddenly encounters cold, it will condense into a piece of water and become a light mist. What we see is this light mist. As for when the weather is too warm, the temperature of the outside air is high, and it does not affect the water vapor inside the air we exhale, so we cannot see it.</p>
<p>"Second, why do we seem to see red light when we close our eyes?"</p>
<p>This question is very wonderful and interesting. Our eyes are slightly transparent. They cannot stop the external light from penetrating into the eyes. When we close our eyes and look at the light, the light that passes through the eyes passes through the red blood that is always in our eyes. The red blood will retain other light and only let the red light shine in, so we see a red light.</p>
<p>"Third, why can't we sleep with our eyes open?"</p>
<p>When we are sleeping, can we lift our hands in the air? We can't! What is the reason? That is the same as the reason why we cannot sleep with our eyes open, which I am about to talk about. We sleep to rest our strength. Our eyes are also exerting force when they are open. So when it's time to sleep, our eyelids droop down due to their own weight. In other words, they are resting. Therefore, we will definitely close our eyes when we sleep!</p>

<h3 id="e104">The British National Entertainments Service Association <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has been actively promoting war propaganda. Three days after Britain declared war, the "National Entertainments Service Association" was established. This is an organization in which people from all sectors of the entertainment industry in the UK - including drama, film, singing, and music - engage in wartime service.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Entertainments Service Association has performed 10,000 shows both domestically and internationally within a year, reaching a total audience of 7 million people. It has also performed 5,538 shows in France, entertaining 2,241,550 soldiers. The association mobilized famous British playwrights, stars, and singers, with their footprints reaching as far north as Iceland, as far east as Cairo, as far west as coastal areas, and as far south as British South Africa.</p>
<p>In August of last year, they also received an order from the Minister of Labor to work in munitions factories across the country, having provided entertainment to munitions workers in places such as Meng Queqi and other places, performing 3,000 shows. This has had a significant and superior impact on regulating the lives of workers and increasing production quantities.</p>
<p>Since London has been constantly subjected to air raids, they have begun to be active in air-raid shelters, opening many concerts in the trenches during alarms.</p>
<p>This is a performance of the achievements of Chinese wartime artists serving the country.</p>
<h3 id="e105">"Ode to Uprightness" Prelude <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Bing</p>
<p>In order to increase the creative interest of young playwrights, to encourage the production of great plays, and to make up for the shortage of scripts, the Shanghai Theatre Society launched a "Script Bonus" campaign, and the situation has been quite enthusiastic. As a result of the judging, Mr. Wu Zuguang's "Ode to Uprightness" (i.e., Wen Tianxiang) won the first prize. Playwright Wu Zuguang is currently teaching at the Chongqing Drama School. It is said that he spent two years writing this script, which shows his serious attitude toward writing.</p>
<p>The past "The Great Ming Heroes," "Li Xiuyu Dies for His Country," "Yi Ge Nennang," and the recently staged "Hong Xuanjiao" at the Carlton, all made people feel refreshed. The stories of loyalty, courage, tragedy, generosity, and enthusiasm are indeed too touching. In the "Ode to Uprightness," there will be even more exciting and lovely performances.</p>
<p>The writing of "Ode to Uprightness" is very novel. The play has four acts and ten scenes in total. The story begins with an old man narrating the life of Wen Tianxiang's loyalty and fighting spirit to his grandson, and then uses the昏庸 and the corruption of奸佞 in the dynasty as a foil. There are more than 100 actors, including all the basic and special actors, on stage, and at the same time, one person plays two roles. The cost of staging this play by the Yishe Theatre Society is not small. The performance fee alone has cost 10,000 yuan. In other aspects, whether it is in actors, scenery, or props, it exceeds the record of "Home."</p>
<p>The date is from the evening performance on June 4th, and only evening performances will be held every day after that. On holidays, there will be two performances, day and night, or "Tears Splattered on Flowers" and "Parasitic Grass" will be performed during the day.</p>
<p>For this play "Ode to Uprightness," I would like to sincerely recommend it to all those who love drama.</p>

<p>Chen Yunshang recently moved from the Ziuming Apartments on Julu Road to No. 318 Fergusson Road, Juerdian Road, because the old residence was not enough. The new apartment was found for her by her sister Li Minghui and others. The house is very spacious and has a small garden, and the scenery is quite beautiful.</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Gongsun's Sword Energy, Part One</p>
<p>Xu Jing was once again stunned by Wang Yongtai's words. How could the old man have already known that he had secretly come here to expose their adulterous affair? Strange, strange, strange! He had no choice but to clasp his hands and say, "Little one knows that this action was impulsive, and I did not inform my uncle before acting. I beg your forgiveness, old sir. It is only because your nephew suffered an unjust grievance before, and I saw no opportunity to defend myself before my uncle. Furthermore, I have long observed the ambiguous relationship between these two, so I came here tonight specifically to capture them both, then to seek forgiveness from my uncle and explain the reasons. Firstly, to make my uncle understand my grievance, and secondly, to eliminate future concerns for my uncle. Uncle is wise and understanding and will surely be able to appreciate my actions." Wang Yongtai listened, nodding. He walked to the two of them, and seeing their filthy and sordid state, he felt anger rising within him, his beard bristling. He shouted, "Bitch! What a good thing you've done! Spreading false accusations and slander against good people in my presence, turning me against my virtuous nephew Xu, causing me to bear the blame for misjudgment. Today, you pair of adulterous dogs, how can you face me?" Xu Jing, standing beside him, also said to He, "Sooner or later, the truth of the matter will come to light. You can now explain clearly to my uncle whether I came to seduce you or you came to entice me? I, Xu Jing, am an upright man, who would ever do such beastly things as you do?" Wang Yongtai also kicked his foot out, swiftly drawing a bright, sharp dagger from his bosom, pointing it at He Ji, and sternly said, "Bitch, confess quickly! Can you still try to argue?" He Ji, with tears streaming down her face, said, "This matter is truly my fault, because I failed to seduce Young Master Xu, and I feared he would expose my wrongdoing to you, so that night I deliberately fabricated events and falsely accused him. It was truly a moment of madness. I know I am not worthy to be your concubine, my lord. I beg you to consider the affection of the past few years and spare my dog's life, let me go back, and I will never forget your great kindness." Then she recounted how she had tried to seduce Xu Jing and how she deliberately left behind the handkerchief. Wang Yongtai gritted his teeth and said, "If it weren't for my virtuous nephew exposing your secret tonight, wouldn't I still be in the dark? Alas! The shame within the household is difficult to speak of. My old face of Wang Yongtai has been completely disgraced by you. "He also yelled at Sang Yiqing, "Dog thief! I have treated you well, yet I never expected you to be a beast in human clothing, ungrateful and treacherous, colluding with this harlot. Is your flesh still fit to eat? What do you have to say?" (Seven or eight)</p>
