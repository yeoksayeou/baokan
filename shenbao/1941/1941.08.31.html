<p>合衆社三十日華盛頓電本年勞働節適値歐戰兩週年紀念、羅斯福總統特乘此機會、將於是日向全國廣播演說、此决演說爲羅總統與邱吉爾會晤後及開始共現時與日本之談判復首次在無綫電演講、因此美國更非常關切期待總統之演說、總統昨晚啓程往其海德公園別墅、</p>
<p>國際社三十日華盛頓電羅斯福總統昨將太平洋和平問題、比諸太平洋本身、總統宜稱、和平問題之廣闊一如太平洋、是以今日而貿然推測戰事是否可藉談判而避免、殊不可能、自日本駐美大使野村與國務院諸大員在華府舉行會談以來、總統之發表公告尚屬初次、此間政府官員雖並未表示過分樂觀、但有識之觀察家認爲美政府自決定藉談判途徑、作覓致與日本成立諒解之企圖後、局勢似已較日本加入軸心以來仟何時期爲佳、消息靈通界又稱、美國如能設法使中日事件得以早日解決、則日本定將樂於退出軸心、而投入民治國之懷抱、允其對美國恢復正常貿易關係云、</p>
<p>路透社卅日東京電據此間日政府人“宣稱、柏林無錢電所傳美日已成立妥協之說、未免過早、大使館方面亦未能予以證實、據私人消息謂、納粹現正試圖探求華盛頓談判之宗旨云、路透社倫敦三十日電今日此間消息、英政府現隨時接獲美日談判之情報、</p>
<p>近衛致羅斯福私函僅廣泛說明日政策</p>
<p>華盛頓三十日電　據與美政府接近之可靠方面人士告中央社記者稱、日首相近衛致美總統羅斯福函內、並無眞正重要或具體之表示、僅就日本在南太平洋之和平·經濟·與共榮之政策、作廣泛之說明、近衛之姿態表示日本在軍事政治及經濟、已處於極窘之狀態、日駐美大使野村自本年二月到任以來、根本毫無成就、故近衛認爲美日兩國正逐步趨向戰爭前致美總統之函中爲渠對美總統直接並最後之呼籲、希望美日間糾紛可獲有解決之基礎、目下若干觀察家認為近衛此舉、足予兩方以不侵犯機會、以便兩國可重行審議其彼此之立場、但另有其他觀察家則認為日本之目的、僅在延宕時間以待適當之機會、美國若干閣員對目下局勢甚表悲觀、但政府內負責美國外交政策之當局、則認爲與野村繼續舉行談話以後、可商定相常具體而滿意之解決辦法、此雖或爲臨時性質、但當可有成立希望、華府方面現益信美國擬同意暫維現狀、但日軍仍留越南而不進攻泰國·西比利亞·馬來亞及荷印、至於最後之基本解決辦法、擬俟世界大戰結束後冉商、但同時各方咸懷欵日本之諾言是吾可信、遠東觀察家認爲遠東局勢之和平解決、在美國政府同所歡迎、但何者屬於正當、何者並非正當、決定之權應操諸美國政府、據與國務院接近者談、美對日政策並無軟化之情事、美日商定最後解決辦法之時、美方自擬堅持日軍應全部自中國境內撤退、外交界認爲日前白宮會議爲美日兩方檢討重要問題之第一步、此事足以表示日本希望能避免兩國關係之急轉直下一說、近衛之函件旨在促使總統·赫蘭國務卿、及日本野村大使舉行會議、以澈底探討兩方成立最後協定之可能性、惟日本既推行侵略之政策、美日兩國政策距離旣如此之遠、則欲求其普遍之解決辦法、自有極大之困難、蓋美國解決國際糾紛之政策、基於一九三七年七月十六日之赫爾聲明、凡有姑息氣味之辦法、美政府絕不願考慮及之也、</p>
<p>中國盼美堅持立場　對日遷就養　貽患</p>
<p>合衆社三十日重慶電　此間官方人士昨稱、彼等並未爲羅斯福總統與野村大使談話之消息所驚擾、華人消息靈通方而相信、美國業已對日本提出茶千肯定之建議、彼等並猜測近衛致羅斯福之手札、或後初步回答之性質、此間雖未宣佈美國建議之性質、惟消息靈通界人士咸認此項　議、將無被日本接受之可能、此間官方雖相信美日談話不致損害中國之利益、惟華人方而頗有因聞得美國企圖「將日本拉出軸心」之消息而感不安、若干消息靈通界華人認爲、美國如因企圖拉攏日本退出軸心而對日本讓步、日本勢將不致犧牲任何主要利益、而獲得時效及精力、以籌備更猛烈之程序云、</p>

<h3 id="c3">美日談判的底蘊 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>以溝通美日異見爲己任的日本駐美大使野村，在和赫爾國務卿數度進行非正式談話之後，竟不顧美國政府在派遣軍事代表團來華和宣佈堅持海上自由兩事中所表現的堅決態度，又以所謂近衛的手札，面呈羅斯福總統，其內容雖未經透露，但不問可知，必是日本企圖延宕時日的又一策動；此一文件即使寫着滿紙的和平保證，也掩飾不了日本希望延緩「攤牌」。以期等待較爲有利的時機的眞實用心，因此吾人絕對不信早已屛絕綏靖政策，並一再宣佈決心協助「中國及世界各國反抗武力征服運動」的華盛頓政府，會上近衛野村的當。</p>
<p>美日談判的目標，據說乃在就遠東問題，覓取公允的和平解決方案，這是英相邱吉爾所正式宣佈的綱領。至於細目，依據羅邱宣言的八項原則，以及赫爾國務卿堅持九國公的的聲明，不難想像美國所要求於日本者，至少當包括放棄侵略，脫離軸心，保證不再南進或北進等三項；以國內方因急進派不滿政府行動迂緩而致發生平沼凶案的日本，試問如何能夠接受這類要求。反之，衡諸日本軍閥的一貫主張，其所希望於美國者，至少當爲承認「既成事實」，售止援華，放棄對日包圍等數項，這又豈是以根絕侵略遺毒樹立永久和平爲宗旨的美國所能遷就？雙方意見的距離，既如此遼遠，人人皆知其斷無妥協餘地，然則雙方又爲什麼不憚麻煩，愼重其事地進行談判呢？彼此既肯接洽，不論有無誠意，可見其各有所預期的作用。</p>
<p>就日本言，已如上文所述，其最主要的用意，無非是在延宕時日，因爲德蘇戰事既呈膠着，南太平洋的聯合陣綫又被他人佔了上風，而遠東紅軍的威力更未便過於輕敵。因此，國內雖受着急進派的壓力，在目前却不得不仍和美國虛相委蛇，以期一方延緩「最後火併」的一慕，一方却正好再觀望一下德蘇戰局，老實說，如果不是英蘇聯軍爭制機先，穩定了伊朗和整個近束，說不定日本已乘着德軍在烏克蘭的局部勝利，準備有所行動。</p>
<p>其决，就美國言，羅斯福總統此决和英相邱吉爾會談結果，確已決定用盡一切方法，支持蘇聯，務使紅軍能把東綫戰事拖過今冬，（伊朗事件說不定便是羅邱會談所決定各項援蘇行動中之一端）祗要納粹的鐵蹄無從自冗長的東綫拔出，英美便不難在援蘇的同時，運用壓力，解決日本。所謂運用壓力，當然最理想的成就，是「兵不血刃、便使日本屈服，因爲遠東包圍綫成立之後，日本在軍事　經濟上乃至外交上，都已陷於十足的孤立，祗要歐戰不生變化，或其他方面不使日本取得可乘之機　美國政府當局似乎頗有「壓服」日本，使其自動「軟化」的把握，實際上，這些天野村的緊追不捨，以及近衛的親致手札，不管其中別有用意，但至少確已顯示日本氣燄，已被抑低。</p>
<p>綜上所言，可知日本的對美談判，祇是企圖延宕太平洋大戰爆發的時機，以等待更有利的形勢，至於美國之不惜以最大的忍耐，和日本周旋，則因爲覷定目前正是運用戰爭以外手段，可使日本讓步的機會。雙方的用意，雖截然不同，但其所引爲他日行動基準的，却不的而同，都側重在德蘇戰事。因此，目前無論正式談判尚未進行，成敗遙不可期，即使今後稍有眉目，也和建築在沙灘上的宮殿一樣脆弱，祇要一層暴風雨或一陣浪花，頃刻之間，便會烟消雲散。這是就積極方面而言，假定談判無成，則英美中蘇荷的民治集團，既早已嚴陣以待，日本即使鋌而走險，恐怕也逃不了「甕中之鼈」的最後運命。時而與日本爲敵、殊不利於英國、又謂獎國甚不願破裂其對日和平關係、故近衛致美總統之函甚可視爲重要、惟其結果如何、無人能預測耳云、</p>
<p>合衆社三十日東京電　常反映政府高級方面意見之　日本新聞週報」、本日籲請美國及日本之政治家採取一種妥協及修好之精神、以溝通美日間現時之隔閡、該週報主張現時應積極拋棄舊日之策略及消慶時間之迂迥談制、而採取立即行動、該報言、「日美間之問題甚多、且其範圍及性質亦相差甚遠、故日本在發動修好時、有廣大之選擇范圍、然無論其所選擇者為何、日本必須廢棄其以美國對於遠東事務無合法之利　關係之態度、此種態度不獨與吾人所知之事實不符、且有遠日本之明白宜佈承認各國在其所擬之「共榮　」地域內之合法權利」云、該報又稱、「吾人有此兩位能幹而謹愼之外交家、「美駐日大使格魯及日駐美大使野村」竭力從事解決此問題、　材幹如美國務卿赫爾及豐田外相者、復表示極願和平解決此問題、故必有趨向正當途徑之進展、不致使吾人失望」云、</p>
<p>合衆社三十日東京電　東京各執一致重視美日談話「國民新聞」稱羅與野村之談判、應視爲極端重要、因其對於人類幸福與太平洋之命運有遠大影響故也、該報繼稱、「此種談判應以建立「東亞共榮圈」爲根據、並與日木對華作戰主要原則平行、」該報謂、除非美國作新的轉變、否則遠東之政治談判終將無效、「朝日新聞」及「日日新聞」咸謂、近衛致書之目的、在於澄淸日本解決中國事件之不變政策及建立「東亞共榮圈」造成太平洋之永久和平、因美日之關係現已成爲最大之關切云、</p>

<p>— 斐</p>
<p>各級學校，都要秋季開學了，莘莘學子，開始過那學校生活，當此非常時代，應該如何確立人生思想，如何實行節的生活，在事前自宜加一番考慮與研究，以前的思想行爲，自以爲還好的，應該力求更好，備具這種日新又新的精神，才無忝爾所生，才對得起社會國家，易稱：「大人虎變，君子豹變，小人革面，」我希望學生最好實行虎變，其次也須豹變，至於革面，決不是內心的警覺，算不得眞的變革。本報秋季始業特刊，想在學子思想行爲的變革方面，貢獻一點意見，各篇所述，雖沒有崇高的理想，倘能切實履行，定有相當的收穫。</p>
<h3 id="c69">互助精神的完成 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 趙宗預</p>
<p>人類最偉大的精神，不是別的，而是互助。人類因爲能够實行互助，所以人類的力量，超越一切動物，而人類的光明，也沒有限量。可是互助，是有先決條件的，互助的先決條件，就是自助。必先自己奮發有爲，做些具體成續出來，這種具體成續，他人認爲滿意，認爲有成功的希望，同時你發見前途的困難，有非自己力量所能解決，於是提出求助的呼籲，打動了他人的同惰，無報償的給你援助，這就是人助。孟子說：「多助之至天下順之。」古人以爲多助，由於得道，其實這個道，並不是玄妙的，抽象的，而是具體的，我上述的自助，就是道，能够自助，就是得道。比方這决得申報助學金的大中補小各位學生，就是一個證據。如果各位不能在艱難困苦的環境中奮鬥，奮鬥出令人滿意的成續，那裹有如許熱心人士，慷慨解囊，切實作物質上的援助呢</p>
<p>我希望這次得到申報助學金的各位，今後加倍努力，好像前錢的將士，生力軍到逹以後，原來的將士，應該勇氣百倍，衝鋒陷陣，才會獰得空前的勝利。各位的學業操行，都是百尺竿頭，更上一步，自助愈努力，人助愈衆多，這是一定的道理。反之，各位誤以爲得到了人助，一切可以無憂，自助的精神，漸漸消沈，自助的熱力，漸漸减殺，結果使他人失望，那末已得到的人助，或許要喪失呢！</p>
<p>即使各位今後能夠格外努力，格外精進，足以符合他人的期望，同時還須立下一個決心，將來務必實踐助人，精神方面也好，物質方面也好，有一分力量，幫助人家一分，從狹義說，在各位是報德，從廣義說，在各位是完成做人的實任。如果各位但知藉自助來獲得人助，絕不肯出力助人，那末各位仍不免爲自私自利的人，自私自利與互助，是根本上不相容的。從自助而人助，自人助而助人，互助精神於以發揚，在各位是表現了崇高的人格，在社會是增加了幾個推進光明的戰士，申報的助學金，不過一個例子，各位一生的行動，都逃不了這個道理。就是一個民族的所由發揚光大，也是如此。</p>

<p>敦品勵學，養成有用之才，道就是本位救國。同時利用課餘時光，做能够做應該做的社會服務，做得切實有效，決不該但知求學，不問一切，好像自己脫離社會似的。以下八點，可作我們的座右銘。</p>
<p>（一）做到老，學到老，前途無量·做到老，教到老，一世無成，前者是自動，後者是被動，結果遂有天壤之別。</p>
<p>（二）怕難，越做越難，不怕難，任何難關都會打破，自來一個人的成敗，其因素最多，而心理的建設。實最重要。</p>
<p>（三）胸懷坦白，誤會自去，開誠布公，疑慮盡釋，集體生活，雖難實易。</p>
<p>（四）有定識，然後有定心，有定心，然後有定力，有定力，則無堅不摧，無攻不破。</p>
<p>（五）處處替大衆著想，時時爲大衆盡力，必能獲得許多人的同情，以後做事，便非常便利了。</p>
<p>（六）做事常帶三分傻氣，則成功必多，做人常帶三分土氣，則生活不會奢侈，靑年人最宜注意及此。</p>
<p>（七）說得到，見得到，做得到，說話好像開支票，必須句句兌現，吾則言與行違，越多說，越受人輕視。</p>
<p>（八）有事做，隨手做完，沒事做，要尋事做，自動精神，在此表現。自動精神，是一個人前途的量尺。</p>

<h3 id="c72">求學方法的要義 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 陳選善</p>
<p>本文作者係工部局華人教育處處長，對本報護者助學金事，多所指導，承撰此文，意義精湛，希讀者注意。（編者）</p>
<p>暑假過去了，學校開學了，各位可愛的靑年，父從散漫的假期生活，回到有規律的學校生活。在這學期更始的時候，我願意提出關於求學方法的要義，和各位談談。</p>
<p>（一）持之以恒：求學的第一條件，要有恒心。不可見異思遷，不可一暴十寒。凡事也須經過持久的努力，才能發生興味。求學亦是如此。努力是成功之母，成功乃興趣的源泉。舊式教育，祇教學生苦讀，硬讀，而完全不顧學習者的興趣，固然是失計。但祇講求表面的刺激，一時的衝動，而不去培植眞正的持久的興趣，也是錯誤的。眞正的興趣，是在繼續不斷的努力學習中發生的。</p>
<p>（二）循序而進：求學的第二條件，要按步就班，循序而進，不可躐等。好高驚遠，祇求速進，結果弄得一事無成。學問是有層决的，例如算術，四則沒有學得好，就學代數，幾何，必致障碍發生；其他各科也是如此。現在有許多靑年，喜歡轉學，跳級，便是祗求速進，不講實質的毛病。「欲速則不達」，我們要以此爲戒。</p>
<p>（三）善立基礎：房子要造得高，根基一定要打得牢。要求高深的學問，必定要樹立廣博的基礎。所謂善立基礎，第一注重工具的學科，如國文，數學，外國語等；第二要注重基本的或相關的學科，例如研究教育的，必須學習生物學，社會學，心理學；研究工程的，必須畢習數學，物理學等。基礎堅固他日才可靑雲直上。</p>
<p>（四）自動學習：也許別的事情，可以由別人替做，學習是絕對不能由別人代替的。不但要自已學習，還要自動的學習。要知道祇有自動的學習，才能得到眞實的學問；祗有自動學習，才能發生濃厚的興趣。</p>
<p>（五）時求證騐：閉戶造車，出門未必合轍。祗在學校裹求得一些書本上的知識，將來服務社會，未必能够水乳交融，也許有托格不入的弊病。社會上對於學生一種普遍的批評，就是與社會實際情形太隔閡，太不切於實際。所以我們要注意到社會的情形，社會的變動，社會的問題，將學校裹所學習的，時時向經歷中求證騐。這樣，所求得的學問，便不致隔靴搔癢。而切於實際了。</p>

<p>你喜歡名山大川嗎？你想：當然歡喜經歷的。這可以增加你的修養，擴大你的心胸。從前「宗少文夢游五嶽，孫興公遙賦天台」都可作如是想。但在現實的環境裹，不大允許你如此便利。在孤烏上怎樣來增加你的修養擴大你的心胸呢？不錯，秋季始業就要開始，你又可以到學校中去受課了。在學校中有你景仰所在；但你有暇時也可以多到下面幾個地方去實光賞光，呼吸呼吸。（假期沒去過的要去，已去的現在仍耍去。）可使你的</p>

<p>— 直輿</p>
<p>「騎士降龍記」是藝術大師華德狄斯耐繼「白雪公主」「木偶奇遇記」和「幻想曲後的第四部長篇精心傑構，現在已運抵本埠，不日即將在大光明獻映。本片有丑角羅勃彭葛萊加入飾演一個胆小糊塗的「平常人」，描寫他歷險的故事。在攝製方面，它從開始起草大綱，構成一個趣味雋永的故事，直到攝製完竣，完全採用最新式而時代化的五彩卡通喜劇片的設計和策劃，這實在是一部不可不注意的藝壇瑰寶呢！——譯者</p>
<p>這裹要告訴你一點未之前聞的「騎士降龍記」攝製的花花絮絮：</p>
<p>「騎士降龍記」可以說是第一部融溶血肉表演」和富有生氣的卡通片的特色，在一個故事裹底長篇活動電影。</p>
<p>在本片中，華德狄斯耐親自「漏臉」表演，這還是破天荒第一次。</p>
<p>給製米老鼠，唐老鴨，博羅狗，鵝媽媽，茀丁牛，美人魚，……都有共通的相似點。牠們都是「騎士降籠記」中參加演出的「劇中人」。</p>
<p>唐老鴨在走進技術室時，常常扮作馬，換句話說：那承乏唐老鴨發音的克勞倫斯乃許，他起初原本是　來學馬嘶的呢。</p>
<p>華德狄斯耐作畫時，祇用三個指頭和一個大姆指，據說這樣可以節省不少的時間，眞可謂熟能生巧。</p>
<p>在片中，可以聽到最美妙的聲音的效果，在那餘音嫋嫋之際，忽又穿雲裂帛，響遏行雲，殊令人意想不到也。</p>
<p>爲了節制空氣流通起見，所以華德狄期耐的技術人員的大厦中，一千多扇窗戶，都關得緊騰騰地，沒有一扇是開啓的。</p>

<p>時屆七夕，南北梨園，競演「天河巧配」本戲，以應佳節，此風由來已久，固非自今日始也。今年南北各劇院之天河配，允推北平新新戲院所邀集之合作戲爲最佳，人才鼎盛，一時無雙。是劇由荀慧生師主角織女，李萬春飾牛郎，金少山飾金牛神，言菊朋飾張有才，蕭長華飾嘎氏，由林秋雯任志秋朱桂華李雯溪等分飾仙女，以叫班頭牌角色，居然在一劇中合作演出，是誠難得倖遇之盛會也。</p>

<p>第十五章　何處豪家強載歸</p>
<p>人生不幸而爲女兒身，做女兒而更不幸墮身平康，任人採折，不由自主，悲痛何如？這一天，伊正獨坐妝樓，手托香腮，含悲自嘆，忽見田宏遇走上樓來。伊以爲老頭兒是來報喜信的，勉强檢袵爲禮。田宏遇在伊的對而坐下，侍婢送上杳茗。田宏遇把手一揮，叫侍婢退去。他途向圓圓說道：「圓圓，今天我有一件很重要的事情來告訴你，大概你自己做夢也想不到的。」田宏遇說了這話，把手搔着頭。圓圓一想這老頭兒一心想我做他的姬妾，還有什麼重要的事呢？遂剔着指甲問道：「大人有什麼重要的事？」田宏遇道：「我明白告訴你吧。我女兒近在宮中見皇帝時時憂着流寇，龍顏不樂，鎭日價悶損在懷，無以爲遣。遂和我商量後，要把你送入宮廷，獻於皇上。因爲你生得傾城傾國之貌，宛如忘憂之草，解語之花，必能使皇上喜歡，解去皇上的憂悶，所以老夫寗犧牲自己，而把你進獻了。大概你也可以同意的吧。」圓圓一聽這話，果然是伊做夢也想不到的。雖然一入宮門，終身難出，伴君也如伴虎狼一樣，不能輕批逆鱗，自取其禍，然而自己若嫁與這行將就木的老頭兒，侯門深如海，不得見天日，也是斷送了一生。兩兩比較，當然還是去侍奉聖駕好得多了。况聞當今皇上是一位有道的賢主，自己究竟是小民，得爲宮妃，可謂出泥塗而上靑雲了。遂說道：「謝謝大人的美意，只恐小女子闾巷小民，靑樓出身，不知宮闈禮儀，如何去奉侍皇上？竟使我且喜且憂了。　（一五六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">若杉 Returns Home, Talks About US-Japan Relations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th. Waksugi, a diplomatic advisor to the Japanese ambassador to the United States, returned to Japan today and told reporters that Admiral Nomura had a long-standing friendship with President Roosevelt and senior U.S. naval authorities, so he was able to quickly make contact with the U.S. government authorities. Waksugi did not discuss the current U.S.-Japan negotiations, saying that he was returning to Japan on a Japanese oil tanker and was unable to keep abreast of current events during the journey. He said that although he believed relations between Japan and the United States were tense, Japanese residents in the United States were determined to remain. Waksugi also said that although anti-interventionist sentiment in the United States was very high, isolationists would not be able to stop the government's policies, but the American people hoped for peace.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Success or Failure of US-Japan Negotiations Hinges on Peace or War in the Pacific; President Roosevelt to Deliver Radio Address Tomorrow; Nazis Express Deep Concern About US-Japan Reconciliation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 30th. Labor Day this year coincides with the second anniversary of the European war. President Roosevelt will take this opportunity to broadcast a speech to the nation on this day. This important speech will be President Roosevelt's first radio address after his meeting with Churchill and the start of the current negotiations with Japan. Therefore, the United States is paying close attention to and anticipating the President's speech. The President departed for his Hyde Park villa last night.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 30th. President Roosevelt yesterday compared the Pacific peace issue to the Pacific Ocean itself. The President said that the peace issue is as broad as the Pacific Ocean, so it is impossible to rashly speculate today whether the war can be avoided through negotiations. This is the first time the President has made a public announcement since the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, held talks with senior officials of the State Department in Washington. Although government officials here have not expressed excessive optimism, informed observers believe that the situation seems better than at any time since Japan joined the Axis, after the U.S. government decided to seek an understanding with Japan through negotiations. Well-informed sources also said that if the United States could find a way to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict as soon as possible, Japan would be happy to withdraw from the Axis and return to the embrace of democratic countries, allowing it to restore normal trade relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th. According to Japanese government officials here, claims that the United States and Japan have reached a compromise, as reported by the Berlin wireless station, are premature and have not been confirmed by the embassy. According to private sources, the Nazis are now trying to explore the purpose of the Washington negotiations. Reuters, London, 30th. Today, sources here say that the British government is constantly receiving information about the US-Japan negotiations.</p>
<p>Konoe's Private Letter to Roosevelt Only Broadly States Japanese Policy</p>
<p>Washington, 30th. According to reliable sources close to the U.S. government, the Central News Agency reports that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's letter to U.S. President Roosevelt contained no truly important or specific expressions, only broad statements about Japan's policy of peace, economy, and co-prosperity in the South Pacific. Konoe's posture indicates that Japan is in an extremely difficult state militarily, politically, and economically. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura has achieved nothing since taking office in February of this year. Therefore, Konoe believes that the United States and Japan are gradually moving towards war. In his letter to the U.S. President, he made a direct and final appeal to the U.S. President, hoping that the disputes between the United States and Japan could have a basis for resolution. Some observers currently believe that Konoe's move is sufficient to give both sides a chance not to infringe on each other so that the two countries can re-examine their respective positions. However, other observers believe that Japan's purpose is only to delay time to wait for an appropriate opportunity. Some members of the U.S. cabinet are very pessimistic about the current situation, but the authorities within the government responsible for U.S. foreign policy believe that after continuing talks with Nomura, a fairly specific and satisfactory solution can be agreed upon. Although this may be of a temporary nature, there is hope that it can be established. Washington is now increasingly convinced that the United States intends to agree to temporarily maintain the status quo, but Japanese troops will remain in Vietnam and not attack Thailand, Siberia, Malaya, or the Dutch East Indies. As for the final basic solution, it is planned to be discussed after the end of the world war. However, at the same time, all parties are doubtful about the credibility of Japan's promises. Far East observers believe that a peaceful solution to the Far East situation is welcomed by the U.S. government, but the right to decide what is just and what is not should be in the hands of the U.S. government. According to those close to the State Department, the U.S. policy toward Japan has not softened. When the United States and Japan agree on a final solution, the U.S. will insist that the Japanese army should completely withdraw from Chinese territory. The diplomatic community believes that the recent White House meeting was the first step for the United States and Japan to review important issues, which is sufficient to indicate that Japan hopes to avoid a sudden turn for the worse in relations between the two countries. Konoe's letter aims to urge President Hull and Japanese Ambassador Nomura to hold meetings to thoroughly explore the possibility of the two sides reaching a final agreement. However, since Japan is pursuing a policy of aggression and the policy distance between the United States and Japan is so great, it is extremely difficult to seek a general solution. The U.S. policy of resolving international disputes is based on Hull's statement of July 16, 1937, and the U.S. government will never consider any measures that smack of appeasement.</p>
<p>China Hopes US Will Maintain Stance, Concessions to Japan Will Breed Trouble</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 30th. Official sources here said yesterday that they were not alarmed by the news of President Roosevelt's talks with Ambassador Nomura. Chinese sources believed that the United States had made a series of affirmative proposals to Japan. They also speculated that Konoe's note to Roosevelt was of a preliminary response. Although the nature of the U.S. proposal has not been announced here, well-informed sources believe that this proposal is unlikely to be accepted by Japan. Although officials here believe that the US-Japan talks will not harm China's interests, some Chinese quarters are uneasy about hearing news that the United States is trying to "pull Japan out of the Axis." Some informed Chinese believe that if the United States makes concessions to Japan in an attempt to win Japan out of the Axis, Japan will not sacrifice any major interests and will gain time and energy to prepare for more violent procedures.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 30th. The morning newspapers here yesterday did not pay much attention to President Roosevelt's talks with Ambassador Nomura and Japan's recent protest against U.S. oil shipments to Vladivostok. The "New York Times" said, "Regarding the issue of U.S. oil tankers transporting to the Soviet Union, there is only one possible decision. It is unimaginable to recall these oil tankers because of Japan's threats, and it is too timid and cowardly. If Japan issues warnings to the oil tankers or takes hostile actions against them, it is Japan's explanation. It is the country's own way of doing things, willing to make its people displaced and impoverished." The "Tribune" said that Prime Minister Konoe's note to President Roosevelt "is a dramatic posture, but its importance is less than dramatic. The Japanese cabinet is now in a difficult position because of the incessant clamor of the defeated warlords, just as Japan's current economic position has fallen into a dead end." The newspaper also said, "We don't need to sympathize with the country because of this, nor do we need to make concessions to Japan in principle to temporarily win over Japan. This move is only enough to win over Japan for a while, and when the situation in Europe changes, Japan will still move forward."</p>
<p>Tokyo Watches the Future of Negotiations; Achievement Is Unlikely Without a Change in Policy</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th. Japanese Foreign Minister Toyota yesterday attended an emergency cabinet meeting and then met with the Emperor. It is generally believed that this is a symbol that the Japanese side has received the Soviet Union and the United States' replies to the Japanese negotiations or that President Roosevelt has expressed his attitude towards Konoe's private letter. Key cabinet members all attended the emergency meeting, and there seemed to be a pessimistic atmosphere. However, according to the news released by the United States, future US-Japan negotiations will be conducted directly by Nomura and the US President, rather than with the State Department, so there is still some hope. Authoritative sources feel that the current US-Japan negotiations now involve a thorough decision, and the issue of peace or war can be decided within a few days, but the results may not be announced in Japan for a while. Acting spokesperson of the Information Bureau, Kishiiichi, broadcast to the nation last night, refuting British Prime Minister Churchill's criticism of the Japanese army and his misunderstanding that Japan's southward advance is a threat to British interests. Kishiiichi urged Britain and the United States to reconsider their policies toward Japan based on the theories they recently announced, and said that Britain should deeply understand this.</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Underlying Meaning of US-Japan Negotiations <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nomura, the Japanese ambassador to the United States who takes it as his responsibility to bridge the differences between the United States and Japan, after conducting several informal talks with Secretary of State Hull, ignored the firm attitude shown by the U.S. government in sending a military delegation to China and announcing its insistence on maritime freedom. He also presented President Roosevelt with the so-called Konoe's note. Although the content has not been revealed, it can be known without asking that it must be another strategy of Japan's attempt to delay time. Even if this document is written with full of peace guarantees, it cannot conceal Japan's true intention to delay the "showdown" in order to wait for a more favorable opportunity. Therefore, we absolutely do not believe that the Washington government, which has long rejected the policy of appeasement and repeatedly announced its determination to assist "China and all countries in the world in resisting the movement of armed conquest," will be fooled by Konoe Nomura's trick.</p>
<p>The goal of the US-Japan negotiations is said to be to seek a fair and peaceful solution to the Far East issue. This is the program officially announced by British Prime Minister Churchill. As for the details, according to the eight principles of the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration and Secretary of State Hull's statement insisting on the Nine-Power Treaty, it is not difficult to imagine what the United States requires of Japan, at least including abandoning aggression, breaking away from the Axis, and guaranteeing not to advance south or north. Japan, where the country is facing the Hiranuma case because the radical faction is dissatisfied with the government's slow actions, how can it accept such requirements. On the contrary, considering the consistent claims of the Japanese warlords, what they hope from the United States is at least to recognize the "established facts," stop aiding China, and abandon the encirclement of Japan. How can this be accommodated by the United States, which aims to eradicate the remnants of aggression and establish lasting peace? The distance between the opinions of the two sides is so far apart that everyone knows that there is no room for compromise. Then why do the two sides bother to conduct negotiations carefully? Since they are willing to contact each other, whether sincere or not, it can be seen that they each have expected effects.</p>
<p>As for Japan, as mentioned above, its main intention is nothing more than to delay time, because the German-Soviet war has become deadlocked, the Allied front in the South Pacific has been taken advantage of by others, and the power of the Red Army in the Far East should not be underestimated too much. Therefore, although the country is under pressure from the radical faction, it has to continue to deal with the United States hypocritically in order to delay the "final showdown," while the other party is just watching the German-Soviet war. To be honest, if it were not for the British and Soviet forces to seize the opportunity and stabilize Iran and the entire Near East, Japan might have taken advantage of the local victory of the German army in Ukraine to prepare for action.</p>
<p>As for the United States, President Roosevelt's decision and the results of his meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill have indeed decided to use all means to support the Soviet Union and ensure that the Red Army can drag the Eastern Front war through this winter (the Iran incident may be one of the various aid-Soviet actions decided by the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting). As long as the Nazi iron hooves cannot be pulled out of the long Eastern Front, it will not be difficult for Britain and the United States to use pressure to resolve Japan while aiding the Soviet Union. The so-called use of pressure, of course, the most ideal achievement is "to subdue Japan without firing a shot," because after the Far East encirclement line is established, Japan has fallen into complete isolation militarily, economically, and even diplomatically. As long as there is no change in the European war or other aspects that allow Japan to take advantage of the opportunity, the U.S. government authorities seem to be quite confident in "suppressing" Japan and making it automatically "soften." In fact, Nomura's relentless pursuit these days and Konoe's personal note, regardless of other intentions, have at least shown that Japan's arrogance has been suppressed.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that Japan's negotiations with the United States are only an attempt to delay the outbreak of the Pacific War in order to wait for a more favorable situation. As for the United States' willingness to deal with Japan with the greatest patience, it is because it has determined that now is an opportunity to use means other than war to make Japan yield. Although the intentions of the two sides are completely different, the basis for their future actions is the same, and they both focus on the German-Soviet war. Therefore, whether the formal negotiations have not yet begun and the success or failure is still far away, even if there are some signs in the future, they are as fragile as a palace built on the beach. As long as a storm or a wave, it will disappear in an instant. This is in terms of the positive aspect. Assuming that the negotiations are unsuccessful, the democratic group of Britain, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands is already on standby. Even if Japan takes risks, I am afraid it will not escape the final fate of "turtle in a jar." It is not conducive to Britain to be an enemy of Japan at times, and it is said that the United States is very unwilling to break its peaceful relations with Japan, so Konoe's letter to the US President can be regarded as important, but no one can predict the outcome.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th. "Japan News Weekly," which often reflects the opinions of senior government officials, today called on politicians in the United States and Japan to adopt a spirit of compromise and reconciliation to bridge the current gap between the United States and Japan. The weekly advocated that old strategies and time-wasting detours should be actively abandoned now, and immediate action should be taken. The newspaper said, "There are many problems between Japan and the United States, and their scope and nature are also very different, so Japan has a wide range of options when launching reconciliation. However, no matter what it chooses, Japan must abandon its attitude that the United States has no legitimate interest in Far Eastern affairs. This attitude is not only inconsistent with the facts we know, but also has Japan clearly announce its recognition of the legitimate rights of all countries in its proposed "co-prosperity" area." The newspaper also said, "We have these two capable and prudent diplomats, "U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura" working hard to solve this problem. Those with talents such as U.S. Secretary of State Hull and Foreign Minister Toyota have also expressed their willingness to resolve this issue peacefully, so there must be progress toward the right path and will not disappoint us."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th. Tokyo's unity attaches importance to US-Japan talks. "Kokumin Shimbun" claims that the talks between Ro and Nomura should be regarded as extremely important because they have a far-reaching impact on human happiness and the fate of the Pacific. The newspaper continued, "This kind of negotiation should be based on the establishment of the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and parallel to Japan's main principles of war against China." The newspaper said that unless the United States makes a new turn, political negotiations in the Far East will be invalid. "Asahi Shimbun" and "Nichinichi Shimbun" all said that the purpose of Konoe's letter was to clarify Japan's unchanging policy of resolving the China incident and establishing the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" to create lasting peace in the Pacific, because US-Japan relations have now become the biggest concern.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Britain Advises Overseas Chinese to Withdraw from Japan; Transport Ship Will Arrive Soon <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th. The British authorities here are now urging British overseas Chinese in Japan and Manchuria to leave the country. British consulates have sent 1,400 circular letters to British and Indian overseas Chinese, informing them that a British evacuation ship will arrive soon, advising those who can travel to take the ship back to their home countries. The wording of this circular letter is the same as the previous evacuation advice letter, but the reason for the freeze regulations has been added.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th. It is heard that the warning to leave the country received by the British overseas Chinese in Japan is entirely of a routine nature, because a ship is about to arrive in Japan, which will give those who wish to leave Japan an opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Sir Sassoon Talks About the Far East Situation; With the Joint Forces of Britain and the United States, Japan Can Hardly Resist; <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Hundreds of US Aircraft Are on Their Way to Chongqing</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 30th. Sir Sassoon arrived here yesterday from Shanghai. It is said that when he was in the Far East, he talked with the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Singapore and met with the US Army and Navy authorities in Manila. As a result, he was convinced that if the situation tended to break down, Japan would not be able to resist the joint forces of Britain and the United States in the Pacific. The main reason is that Britain and the United States have air superiority. Therefore, he often said that Japan would not dare to risk fighting against these two democratic countries with its foolish courage, and Japan would not use troops against the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union was holding back the Axis countries in the west. Singapore is impregnable, and Hong Kong's defenses are also very strong. Japan is not worth attacking Hong Kong, because if Japan invades the port, it will suffer heavy losses. Therefore, what the Japanese side may try to implement is at most to blockade Hong Kong only. Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, because the Japanese side needs to strengthen its troops in the north and south, the Japanese army in mainland China must have been greatly weakened. The fact that the latest U.S. fighter jets are now being transported to Chongqing and will be piloted by overseas volunteer pilots will greatly change the Chinese war and be beneficial to the Chinese side.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Axis Leaders Meet on the Soviet Front to Discuss Cooperation Between the Two Countries; Determined to Fight Until Victory; And to Lay the Foundation for the So-Called New European Order <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Yesterday afternoon, the official announcement of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini stated that Hitler and Mussolini held talks in the field headquarters of both leaders on the northern and southern fronts from August 25th to 29th. All military and political issues during the war were discussed in detail. The review of various issues was based on the spirit of close unity between the two Axis countries and their relationship of sharing life and death. The motivation for the discussion was the strong will of the two leaders to continue the war until victory. The new European order resulting from this victory will eliminate the various causes of past wars in Europe. After the danger of Bolshevism and the exploitation of financial groups are eliminated, the political and economic cooperation of the various nationalities of the European continent can be completed in peace, harmony, and benefit. During this discussion, Hitler and Mussolini inspected important locations on the Eastern Front and reviewed an Italian division fighting against the Soviet army. When Hitler and Mussolini inspected the Southern Front, they were welcomed by German Marshal Rundstedt and also visited the German General Headquarters. Accompanying Mussolini were Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri, Italian Chief of the General Staff General Cavallero, Cabinet Secretary-General Anfuso, who represented Foreign Minister Ciano, who was unable to attend due to illness, as well as General Marras, General Gandin, and many key members of the General Staff. German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen and Military Attaché Lieutenant General Lindemann also accompanied them. During the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and German Chief of Staff General Keitel also participated.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Political figures in Berlin believe that the eleventh meeting between Hitler and Mussolini has great significance. The long official announcement issued this time is unprecedented in previous meetings. This meeting lasted for a long time and was attended by a large number of important military and political figures, probably to discuss the most important events. Berlin figures believe that the announcement regarding this meeting is a statement of the war goals of the Axis powers. It is noteworthy that the announcement only mentions Europe. The participation of Italian troops in the Eastern Front can show the unity and solidarity of Germany and Italy in political and military aspects. The political and military alliance between Germany and Italy has taken root in the hearts of the people. The people of Germany and Italy are determined to continue fighting and strive for final victory. The new European order will eliminate the causes of war as much as possible and eliminate the threat of Bolshevism and the exploitation of financial politics as a prerequisite for building the new order. Destroying Britain's balance of power policy and building a new social and economic order are all important tasks. To ensure social justice, increase production, and improve the living standards of workers and peasants, it is necessary to destroy the liberalism of financial groups and the collectivism of the Communist Party. The peaceful cooperation of European countries, after the collapse of Britain and the Soviet Union, will no longer be threatened and will surely create a new era of economic prosperity and social progress in the new Europe.</p>
<p>Mussolini Returns to Rome and Cables Hitler Expressing Determination</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 30th: According to a statement released last night, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, after returning here, sent a cable to Führer Hitler, which read: "Your Excellency, the meeting between Your Excellency and me over the past few days, as well as the scene of reviewing the Italian and German troops on the Eastern Front, will never be forgotten by me. Our efforts to save Europe from the Bolshevik crisis will forever leave a glorious record in history. After returning to my country this time, I am even more pleased with the achievements of our work, and my confidence in achieving final victory is even more strengthened. I would like to express my gratitude for Your Excellency's courteous hospitality. May Your Excellency and the people of your country have long-term happiness and boundless prosperity."</p>
<p>Public Opinion Believes That the Issue of US-Japan Relations Was Also a Target of Hitler-Mussolini Discussion</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 30th: People here recently stated that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini ended yesterday, lasting five days. This meeting was the most important since the two leaders began their series of discussions. They heard that they had agreed on winter war plans, and the most important point of discussion was how to deal with potential US actions in the Far East and Middle East. Public opinion believes that the issue of US-Japan relations must be one of the main issues discussed by them, because after Iran's surrender, the US-Japan relations will inevitably affect the war in the Soviet Union. Also, regarding the issues of Afghanistan and Turkey, it is expected that there will also be detailed discussions. The former is the second target of Britain and the Soviet Union, and the latter's neutrality is gradually becoming important in the Middle East. It is expected that the so-called winter war plan will include the supply of cold-weather clothing and equipment to the Axis forces in Soviet territory, as well as the preparation of everything for the Axis forces in North Africa to engage in large-scale battles in the cold season. In terms of politics, they must also agree on answers to Roosevelt and Churchill's post-war peace plans. As for sending more Italian troops, such as motorized divisions and gendarmes to be stationed in the occupied areas, to increase the strength of the Axis forces in Soviet territory, it is also mutually agreed. It is feared that they have also discussed sending more Italian agricultural and industrial workers to Germany to accelerate the Axis military production. According to the Italian official Stefani News Agency, Mussolini once drove a four-engine German bomber with Hitler to inspect the entire Soviet front. The news agency also stated that Hitler and Mussolini had exclusive discussions on military and political issues for several hours. Both slept in a field tent. Mussolini met Hitler somewhere in Germany and then traveled together to Hitler's headquarters. Mussolini returned to Italy by train.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Red Army Entering Iranian Territory Expected to Arrive in Tehran Today; Rumors of Negotiations Between Britain, Soviet Union, and New Iranian Cabinet, Presenting Three Conditions Including the Expulsion of Germans <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Istanbul, Turkey, 30th: The Red Army troops attacking Iran are expected to enter Tehran, the capital of Iran, no later than tomorrow. It is rumored here that the King of Iran is about to leave the capital and go to Isfahan, the old western capital. At the same time, the Iranian authorities have ordered martial law and imposed a curfew.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th: A special correspondent for the Soviet Red Star newspaper accompanied the Red Army into Iran. It is said that the Red Army has now entered the central locations in Iranian territory and has been warmly welcomed by the local people. In the Julfa area, the Red Army discovered a German ammunition depot, which was very large and no different from an arsenal, containing the latest machine guns and bombs. The area was also equipped with a German propaganda agency that specialized in transporting secret personnel to Soviet territory. According to Majid, private secretary to the Iranian military leader, German anti-Soviet and anti-British activities in Iran are increasing daily. The German leader Schmidt pressured the Iranian authorities to convene mass meetings, and in addition to reporting the rumors fabricated by Goebbels every day, he also engaged in extremely absurd propaganda. In order to win over the hearts of the Iranian people, German personnel did not hesitate to claim that Hitler had converted to Islam, but the fascist leader was still unpopular in Iran. German personnel often took photos and surveyed the terrain on the Soviet border. In the Caspian Sea, German secret police also conducted conspiracies in the name of merchants.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 30th: Although all battles in Iran are said to have stopped, the British General Headquarters in India announced that British and Soviet troops are still advancing in Iran, and their actions are currently directed from outside. Formal battles may have stopped, as an Iranian envoy has met with the British army and informed its commander that the King of Iran has formally ordered a ceasefire and is prepared to surrender to the British and Soviet armies. It is rumored here that the British and Soviet plans include the following three points: 1. Protect the military and economic communication route through Iran for the Soviet Union and Iraq. 2. Protect the oil pipelines in the Middle East. 3. Prevent the Axis forces from re-entering Iran. At the same time, it is heard that British and Soviet troops are sending troops to garrison the areas they occupy in order to militarily control the entire country of Iran.</p>
<p>Havas, Istanbul, Turkey, 29th: According to news from the Iranian capital, representatives of Britain and the Soviet Union are conducting negotiations with the new cabinet of the country. It is heard that Britain and the Soviet Union have requested Iran to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and expel German expatriates. If Iran accepts, then the British and Soviet military authorities will allow Iran to maintain administrative and financial power.</p>
<p>Eden Explains Policy Towards Iran</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Coventry today, stating that the adequacy of war materials and the excellence of weapons are the two major keys to victory. Since the Soviet Union joined the war, in addition to our own needs, we must also provide assistance to the Soviet Union. Even with the full support of the United States, we still need to redouble our efforts to defeat the strong enemy and shorten the scourge of war as soon as possible. Eden also mentioned the Iranian incident, saying that after the British government learned about the activities of the Germans in Iran, it repeatedly advised the Iranian government to take necessary actions and send these Germans back to their country. Unexpectedly, the Iranian government turned a deaf ear. Britain and the Soviet Union had no choice but to jointly send troops into Iranian territory. Fortunately, no large-scale conflict has occurred since the beginning. The Iranian government has ordered a stop to resistance. In the past few days, London, Moscow, and Tehran have exchanged views. The British and Soviet governments have fully agreed to submit the proposed conditions to the Iranian government soon. The content is not harsh and is only temporary in nature. Now I take this opportunity to reiterate our general attitude, that is, our promise to respect the political independence and territorial integrity of Iran, which we are determined to keep without change. As soon as the military situation permits the withdrawal of troops, we will withdraw all troops in Iranian territory, and hope that as a result of this incident, the friendship between the Allied countries and Iran will become closer.</p>
<h3 id="e15">US Delegation to the Soviet Union; Harriman Appointed as Leader; Duties in England Temporarily Handled by Biggers <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 30th: President Roosevelt revealed yesterday that he intends to send a US delegation led by Harriman to Moscow to consider aid to the Soviet Union in accordance with the decision made by him and British Prime Minister Churchill at the Maritime Conference. According to the President, the US delegation may consist of six people. In addition to Harriman, the names of the rest will be announced in a few days. Harriman is generally known as the promoter of the Lend-Lease Act to England. The President said of him that Harriman was ordered to go to London, and his main mission was to deal with the shipping difficulties of supplying supplies to countries resisting aggression. Now this difficulty has expanded to include various production and supply matters. He intends to have Production Manager Biggers take over Harriman's duties in London. This position is extremely important and cannot be temporarily vacant. In addition to performing Harriman's duties, Biggers is also planning to find ways to make British production issues more closely linked to US production issues. Biggers has now received instructions to go to London. Harriman will still return to London in the future.</p>

<p>Reuters, Sydney, 30th: Former Australian Prime Minister Menzies continues to serve as Minister of Defense in the cabinet.

<h3 id="e17">Soviet Troops Launch Counteroffensive on the Northern Front to Intercept German Troops Attacking Leningrad <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: The Times correspondent in Stockholm reports that Soviet troops are currently launching a vigorous counterattack on the southern end of Lake Peipus, with the aim of encircling the main German forces threatening Leningrad. If the extent of this counterattack is as optimistic as the Soviets expect, then all German troops east and northeast of Pskov are indeed in danger, because they have ventured deep into the bag. The above plan is extremely perfect, but everything still depends on whether the Soviet army has the endurance to cut off the German traffic lines south of Lake Peipus to Estonia and Latvia.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 30th: News from the German-Soviet front here states that Soviet troops have begun a powerful counterattack between Kholm and Toropets, seeking to break through Pskov and Ostrov to threaten the rear of General Guderian's advancing troops towards Leningrad. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that Berlin said that the German army is now taking steps to try to counter the Soviet army's advance. A major battle has broken out between the Lovati River and the Lovat River. The telegram said that if the Soviet army's advance is successful, the German army will be forced to abandon the offensive against Leningrad. The message stated that Tallinn is now a "fire-damaged ruin, and the harbor has become a graveyard of sunken ships."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: Military commentators say that the Germans have recently made another great victory announcement, while the Soviet communique is extremely simple and does not disclose anything. The Germans claim to have occupied Tallinn, which seems quite possible. If so, this is a local major loss for the Soviet army. Upon investigation, the connection between Tallinn and the rear has been cut off, and there is little hope of rescue. However, after the fall of the city, some German troops can be transferred to other attacks, making the position of the Soviet troops on Hango Island across the bay slightly more dangerous. However, the German claim that the railway between Moscow and Leningrad has been cut off is even more serious if true, and Leningrad is now surrounded on three sides, and its east side is also threatened. The Germans are obviously using very large military forces in this area to fight, and they are eager to achieve a victory that will determine the situation before winter. The fortresses of Leningrad and Kronstadt are scattered over a large area and are very strong, but whether they can resist modern tactics such as the German defeat in the Battle of Verdun remains to be seen in the future. The success of the Soviet defense has always depended on flexibility rather than stickiness. The battle situation in the central region is now quite chaotic. The Germans admit the Soviet counterattack in the central region, but say that the counterattack is ineffective. The Soviet side did not mention it. The German offensive in the southern region seems to have been blocked by the Dnieper River. It is believed that the destruction of the large water gate will make the downstream water flow of the Dnieper River turbulent and that pontoon bridges cannot be built for at least three weeks. Whether the German army will continue to attack the Soviet army under General Timoshenko and try to capture the Don River basin will be answered in the future. Judging from the current situation, the German army is expected to launch another large-scale attack in the central region first.</p>
<p>Red Army Troops in Gomel Penetrate Deep into the German Second Defense Line</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 30th: According to the Red Star newspaper, the front-line news stated that the German army is currently rushing to build a second line of defense to prevent the advance of the troops under General Koniev near Gomel, but Soviet troops have already penetrated deep into the German second line of defense. It is reported that the German army is rushing reinforcements from the rear and other defense lines in order to contain the Soviet advance. Moscow's radio station announced that the German attack on Kiev was unsuccessful and that 15,000 people were annihilated. It also said that saboteurs destroyed a large German troop transport vehicle near Warsaw.</p>
<p>German Troops Killed and Wounded 15,000 in Attack on Ukraine</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 30th: News from the front yesterday stated that the total number of German troops killed and wounded in the battle on the Ukrainian front was more than 15,000. According to the evening intelligence, fierce battles are still ongoing along the entire front line from the far north to the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. Our army is fighting fiercely with the enemy along the entire front line.</p>
<p>Reuters, Budapest, 30th: A recent Hungarian communique stated that although the Soviet army has transferred large units to the Dnieper River area and launched fierce counterattacks regardless of all sacrifices in an attempt to break through, they have been unsuccessful and have failed to contain the Allied advance. Several Soviet artillery pieces along the Dnieper River have been destroyed. Allied aircraft have demonstrated their superior strength. The number of Hungarian aircraft lost has not exceeded the average number previously announced.</p>
<p>Germany Claims Soviets Suffered Great Losses of Naval Vessels in the Gulf of Finland</p>

<p>Finnish Communique Officially Announces That Vyborg Has Been Occupied</p>
<p>United Press, Helsinki, 30th: The Finnish High Command officially announced today that Finnish troops have recovered Vyborg.

<p>Reuters, London, 30th - Moscow Radio claims, based on a Stambul dispatch, that Hitler is preparing to attack Turkey.

While the content is difficult to ascertain before the actual submission, it can be said that Britain and the Soviet Union will adhere to their promise of non-interference in Iran's internal affairs, while at the same time using various means to safeguard British and Soviet interests.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 30th - According to observers here, Turkey may soon be forced to take active action, as the country is situated at the crossroads of British-Soviet and German-Italian competition, making it very difficult to maintain strict neutrality for long. Needless to say, the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen's audience with Führer Hitler, and their lengthy conversation, as well as the visit to Turkey of German economic representative Dr. Clodius, are all clear evidence of Germany's importance to Turkey. President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech next Monday, and Führer Hitler also plans to deliver a broadcast speech soon. It is rumored that President Roosevelt may mention the US-Japan negotiations, while Führer Hitler will inevitably address relations with Turkey.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Exchange Stabilization Fund Takes Decisive Action: Black Market Exchange Will No Longer Exist, Speculation Has No Basis, Market Suspended Yesterday; US Commissioner Goes to Philippines to Strengthen Fund Freezing <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The most concrete and effective measures for managing the Shanghai foreign exchange market are being discussed by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, but the final decision will be made after the Hong Kong meeting. However, starting the day before yesterday (29th), several banks in this city holding special notes from the US government allowing them to engage in foreign exchange business, such as HSBC, Mercantile, Chartered, Citibank, Chase, etc., have successively canceled black market foreign exchange quotations or stopped black market transactions. This move has attracted great attention from all sectors, both Chinese and foreign. To crack down on the black market is one of the plans of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Now the aforementioned banks have canceled the black market US exchange quotation, which is undoubtedly the prelude to the implementation of the aforementioned plan. However, black market transactions still could not be eliminated yesterday. Another noteworthy event is that after the black market exchange disappeared, the gold price lost its standard, causing the gold market to be forced to suspend trading yesterday morning. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Extremely small transactions and a downward trend Yesterday, there were still quite a few foreign banks with leading edge who were willing to supply. HSBC's quotation remained unchanged, and black market transactions were slightly active. The bank's opening buying prices in the morning were 2 shillings 8.90635 for British exchange and 4.875 yuan for US exchange, both the same as the previous day. After the opening, there was initially only quotation but no market, but when it became known that Citibank had resumed quoting the black market exchange rate at 4.875 yuan, and later even raised it to 4.9375 yuan, American and other banks were all willing to supply, and the market immediately became cheaper. The current US exchange was sold at 5 yuan, which were successively absorbed by foreign banks and importers. There were no transactions after that. The British exchange closed at 2 shillings 9375 and the US exchange at 5 yuan at noon. It was found that the downward trend of the black exchange yesterday was partly due to the willingness of the banks with leading edge to throw it out, but the general importers, in view of the unpredictable future, did not rush to take it in, so the supply exceeded the demand, and the trend became cheaper.</p>
<p>Speculation Forced to Suspend Market Again Yesterday The English-language North China Daily News said that the Gold Exchange was still closed this morning (30th) (because the black exchange had no market and the gold price lost its standard). The ten leading brokers managing the speculation gold are currently considering a new standard for calculating the price of speculation gold. It is reported that since the fourteen banks here stopped announcing foreign exchange selling prices, the Gold Exchange has been forced to suspend trading since yesterday morning (29th). This afternoon (30th), brokers are holding an important meeting. If appropriate decisions can be obtained, it is expected that the speculation gold market can resume operation on Monday. The Gold Exchange occupies an important position in the speculative market of this city. Although there is a lack of spot gold bars in Shanghai, the daily turnover in the market is very large, often reaching 30,000 to 40,000 bars. According to a famous gold broker in this port, all the gold bars in this city are only 4,000 bars, each weighing ten ounces (English ounces), but the actual number of gold bars in circulation on the market is less than 1,500 bars, because most of the gold bars are owned by private individuals and banks, and are used as collateral.</p>
<p>Strictly Limit the Use of Funds According to a senior official of Mercantile Bank speaking to a reporter from Dazhong News Agency, the reason why the Exchange Stabilization Fund is deeply considering is that although the fund has US$50 million, it cannot be supplied without limits. According to current estimates, Shanghai alone needs US$750,000 per day. How can such limited funds be used for unlimited consumption and repeat the mistakes of the past? Therefore, there must be strict restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange for imported goods. The Hong Kong meeting is to discuss the most concrete and effective measures for managing the Shanghai foreign exchange market. The task of Mr. Mackay and Mr. Hawkins, general managers of Citibank and Mercantile Bank, going south is to ask the Exchange Stabilization Fund for instructions on the scope of business and to provide consultations and express opinions to the Fund. Everything must depend on the outcome of this meeting.</p>
<p>The Black Market Will Soon Be Eliminated According to a banker, the quotation of this black market is displayed by HSBC at a small counter, and other foreign banks also display the price set by it in each bank. Therefore, in summary, since HSBC stopped displaying US exchange prices at the small counter the day before yesterday, other banks also stopped displaying prices. The black market has no public price, and Chinese and foreign brokers are unwilling to buy and sell on its behalf to avoid danger. Import foreign firms are also hoping to wait for the results of the Hong Kong meeting. The black market has been fatally hit, and can only trade in the "blacker market."</p>
<p>The Mission of the US Commissioner to the Philippines is Important Mr. Fox of the US Commission of the Exchange Stabilization Fund suddenly took a clipper plane from Hong Kong to Manila the day before yesterday morning, indicating that the work of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will have amazing developments. Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, pointed out directly, "The work of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will be expressed in the newspapers at the beginning of next week." According to informed sources yesterday, Mr. Fox's flight to Manila is clearly related to strengthening the US freezing of assets, because there are currently eight special commissioners dispatched by the US government in Manila, responsible for supervising the implementation of the freezing order. Mr. Fox's trip is clearly to contact these commissioners, review the effectiveness of the US freezing of Japanese and Chinese funds in the Far East, and discuss a strategy to strengthen the US freezing, which will be implemented by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Commission. It is believed that Mr. Fox will not stay in the Philippines for too long, as he still needs to return to Hong Kong to meet with Dr. Taylor and the general managers of Mercantile Bank and Citibank who have traveled from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Public Utility Yangmi (Imported Rice) of the Municipal Council Reduces Retail Price to 117 Yuan Per Stone Tomorrow <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Yangmi special small-grain rice directly purchased by the Public Utility Bureau of the Public Concession from the Hong Kong government suddenly announced on the 15th of this month that due to the sharp increase in cost, the price per stone increased from 116 yuan to 124 yuan. Up to the 13th of this month, it was announced again that the sales price of the Bureau's Yangmi would be revised to 120 yuan), and it was implemented from the 25th. It has been a week since then. However, in order to implement the purpose of managing rice and reduce the burden on civilians, the Bureau has now decided to reduce the price of its Yangmi by three yuan from September 1st, and change the price to 117 yuan per stone. The announcement is copied as follows: "From September 1st, the highest retail price of our Bureau's Yangmi will be changed to 117 yuan in national currency per stone (net weight 160 jin)."</p>
<p>Shortening Measuring Instruments Exploits the Common People Tongfu Rice Shop at 295 North Jiangxi Road recently shortened the standard five-sheng measuring instrument made by the Rice Shop Industry Association by half an inch. Therefore, the rice it sells is short of three he per five sheng. It was discovered by Zhang Guanxiang, the Chinese head of the Huisi Patrol Room, who summoned Shen Shilian, the shopkeeper from Pudong, to the Special First Court. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the patrol room, prosecuted according to law. Judge Zhu Chuzhe held that the price of rice in this city has reached a peak, and Shen did not hesitate to violate moral conscience and reduce the quantity, making the common people suffer even more exploitation. The situation was especially hateful, so he sentenced Shen to five months in prison as a warning. Shen refused to accept the judgment and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Nie Liusu announced the judgment, rejecting Shen Shiyun's appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Italian Warship Sneaks into Shanghai, Causing Speculation, Japanese Navy Spokesperson Silent, Ship's Crossing Two Oceans to Arrive is Shocking, Japanese Rumors that British Ships Are Preparing to Stop Sailing Are Completely Groundless <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mercury reports that the Italian cruiser Eritrea, weighing 1,200 tons, quietly arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) morning. This is the first Axis warship to arrive in Shanghai since the outbreak of the European War. It is said that the ship had been anchored in Japan for four months. Due to the difficulty in supplying provisions, it left anchor three days and two nights and sneaked into Shanghai. At the Japanese reception for reporters, when asked about the ship's arrival in the port, the Japanese Navy spokesperson did not speak.</p>
<p>According to International Law, Japan Should Detain As for the reason why the ship came to Shanghai, it has not been possible to find out from the responsible parties in Italy and Japan. According to international law, Japan should detain the Eritrea or other Italian ships that take refuge in Japanese ports. It is not yet known whether the Japanese authorities will allow the Eritrea to come to Shanghai and disregard international law.</p>
<p>How Did It Cross the Oceans Secretly The English-language North China Daily News reports that the Italian warship Eritrea fled from Mogadishu, Italian Somaliland in East Africa eleven months ago, and suddenly arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning after taking refuge in Japan for four months. The incident has still aroused speculation from all sides. It is said that the ship escaped from Mogadishu shortly before the British army occupied Italian Somaliland. How it was able to travel such a dangerous long distance, pass through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and avoid the patrols of the British Navy is a mystery. Four months ago, when the Eritrea fled to Japan, there were reports that some Axis ships were flying the Japanese flag in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Therefore, some people in Shanghai believe that the Eritrea may also have sneaked into Japan by falsely flying the Japanese flag without being detected by British ships.</p>
<p>There are Now Five Foreign Warships in the Whangpoo After the sudden arrival of the Italian warship Eritrea in Shanghai, there are now a total of five American, French, and Italian warships anchored in the Whangpoo River. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, the American gunboat Luzon is anchored at the British Navy buoy, the French gunboat LaGrillet is anchored at the French Navy buoy, the Gannatant is anchored on the South Whangpoo sea surface, the Cardoia and Lipan lower-class ships are anchored at the first and second buoys of the Whangpoo River, and the Eritrea is anchored at the twentieth and twenty-first buoys.</p>
<p>British Ships Stopping Sailing is Another Rumor The Shanghai Mercury reports that the Japanese side in this city is spreading the rumor that British shipping companies have prepared to completely move all their ships to Hong Kong in an emergency. A certain company has even received instructions from the British Navy to stop sailing in North China. Regarding this statement, the responsible authorities close to shipping affairs have denied it. British naval officers also said that the news spread by the Japanese is completely untrue. Everything is normal here, and no such instructions have been issued to any shipping company.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is September 1st, Journalist's Day. Journalists across the country will celebrate it enthusiastically. Due to the special environment in Shanghai, only solemn commemorations will be held, and the spirit will be encouraged to replace the ceremony. In addition to firmly believing and working hard in their posts to promote the duties of journalists, journalists in the city will also stand up at 12:00 noon tomorrow and automatically observe three minutes of silence to pay deep condolences to colleagues who have bravely sacrificed themselves since the incident.</p>

<p>According to the financial report announced by Mr. Oliver, the acting treasurer of the Municipal Council today (30th), the income and expenditure of the Municipal Council in the first half of this year totaled a deficit of seven million yuan, that is, a monthly shortfall of more than one million yuan.

The largest expenditure in the report is medical expenses, totaling eighteen million yuan, almost 45% of the total expenditure.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, negotiations on the tax revenue and administrative issues in the area of building roads beyond the border in western Shanghai have been conducted several times since January of this year. Because the opinions of both parties on the details were not consistent, the matter has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. Since the end of July, Mr. Philippe, the Director General and President of the Municipal Council, traveled to Japan and Batavia for a summer vacation, which caused the issue to be suspended for a while. After Mr. Philippe returned to Shanghai on the 26th of this month, he sent a notice to the Central District on the 28th, proposing to discuss the issue again. Therefore, the case will be reviewed again recently.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that a certain officer of the Japanese Marine Corps told reporters yesterday (29th) that the restrictions imposed by the Japanese on various Chinese traffic on the bridges entering Hongkou will continue indefinitely. Chinese driving cars are not allowed to cross bridges at any time. Chinese pedestrians are not allowed to cross bridges after 7:00 pm, and will not be reopened until 6:00 am the next morning. Foreigners are not restricted and must have a epidemic prevention certificate, and are allowed to cross the bridge at any time. Therefore, after 7:00 pm every night, only foreigners and those wearing uniforms can enter Hongkou. According to reports, the assassination wind in the north of the Huangpu River has been very strong in the past few weeks, so the Japanese army restricted Chinese people from entering and leaving on the bridges of the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>Haining Road Intersection Was Once Closed At 9:00 am yesterday morning, the Japanese suddenly closed the border entrance of the restricted area at the intersection of North Shaanxi Road and Haining Road. It was not opened until around 11:00 am. It is said that it was recently due to frequent shootings and bloodshed in Hongkou. The Japanese side closed the bridges in Yangshupu and Pu Bridge in the heart of Hongkou for prevention purposes, and closed the guard line at any time to implement temporary inspections.</p>
<p>Hongqiao Area Is Not Closed The Times reports that a staff member of the Hongqiao District Association said yesterday that the Japanese military headquarters has made a guarantee regarding the residence of foreigners in the Hongqiao area, and there will be no changes without sufficient notice. It is said that this guarantee was made by the Japanese side when the chairman and secretary of the association recently visited the Japanese authorities. In the past few days, rumors have spread that the important locations in the Hongqiao area will be permanently closed from September 1st. The association declares that we have no reason to doubt the guarantee of the Japanese side. The various rumors are exaggerated too much and cause a lot of unease. In our view, these rumors are ridiculous. It is said that when the association receives important information about changes in the living conditions in the Hongqiao area, it will immediately notify the members of the association.</p>

<p>On the 24th of this month, at 6:30 AM, eight armed robbers broke into the Juxing Silver Store at No. 264 Avenue Edward VII and stole gold bars, gold rings, and cash worth over 200,000 yuan. After the incident, the French Concession Police dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest the suspects. Three suspects were apprehended. Based on clues, they proceeded to No. 6 Xie Xin Li, Route Tenant de la Tour, in the western district of Shanghai, to arrest</p>
<p>the key suspect, Chen, who had already fled upon hearing the news. Only his wife, a Ningbo woman named Chen Ji Shi (31 years old), was apprehended. A Mauser pistol, 27 bullets, two handguns, 15 bullets, 104 yuan in hard currency, a packet of loose silver, 130 old silver "double eagle" coins, fifty 10-cent nickel coins, three hundred 5-cent nickel coins, one hundred 1-cent copper coins, and five wristwatches and pocket watches were seized and taken back to the French Concession Police for interrogation. Details had already been reported in the newspapers. As a result of the investigation, the detectives, along with the apprehended criminals,</p>
<p>rushed to the extra-settlement roads in the western district of Shanghai the day before yesterday at 5:00 PM, apprehending twenty-three male and female members of the robber gang and suspects. A portion of the stolen goods, about 30 percent, and 4,000 yuan in cash were seized. Yesterday morning, they went to the western district of Shanghai again to recover stolen goods and brought them back to the French Concession Police. At the same time, officers were dispatched to apprehend the fugitive key suspect and his accomplices for prosecution. It is also rumored that the mastermind behind this case was Feng Yuan Kun (21 years old, from Changzhou), the nephew of Sun Yong Lin, the owner of the Juxing Silver Store. Feng had risen from apprentice to junior staff member within the store. Since the outbreak of war, he had used his position</p>
<p>for personal gain, embezzling over ten taels of gold in succession. Last spring, Sun discovered this and was unable to recover the losses. Consequently, Feng was suspended from work after the Dragon Boat Festival that year and has been idle for over a year. Unexpectedly, Feng harbored malicious intentions and led the robbers to commit the robbery. The French Concession Police have conducted thorough interrogations of the apprehended criminals and summoned the silver store employees to identify the faces of the criminals for prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Grains: What About the Rice Market? The Downtrend Intensifies <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the downtrend in the foreign rice market intensified. In addition to the Pacific's peace atmosphere, the public sales price of glutinous rice has been repeatedly reduced, the new rice harvests have been abundant everywhere, and the foreign exchange controls and low prices have been unfavorable to all parties. Many retail investors sought to get out first, and the big wholesalers were also shaken and unable to hold on. Therefore, the opening price in the morning immediately plunged by three or four yuan. Before the close, traders bought in at the lower prices, but the market still lacked good signs after the sharp fall and small rebound. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by two or three yuan. The price of Xiao Wen rice was 141.5 yuan, and the price of immediately loaded rice was 141.5 yuan to 141 yuan. The spot price of bulk rice was 137.5 yuan. The price of No. 2 Siamese rice fell to 127 yuan and 127.5 yuan. The price of spot foreign rice also fell at the same time. The price of Xiao Wen rice per dan once fell to 111.5 yuan, and the closing price was 112 to 113 yuan, but the sentiment remained weak. This is because the supply was large and the sales were small, and the stock in each warehouse was more than 30,000 bags higher than last week, totaling 1,190,004 bags. The total daily turnover was 10,000 bags, including 500 tons from Yinghua Company.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Cotton Yarn: Market Sentiment Shifts; Longs in Futures Yarn Are Greatly Disappointed <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Jin Shuang Ma futures market situation took a sharp turn, sweeping away the firmness of the previous days. Although American cotton was still on the rise at the opening in the morning, the trend of factory orders was abnormal. Instead of rising based on this, they tended to move downstream. It was rumored that there would be negative news from abroad within a week, causing panic for a while. Therefore, the line of longs in futures yarn was shaken and released. In addition, speculation was monopolized, resulting in selling pressure. As a result, there was a sharp plunge. The opening price of the near-term was 1608 yuan, a sudden drop of 14 yuan. The price of November contracts fell from 1640 yuan to 1620 yuan due to the sharp fall in the exchange. The November contract also fell from the opening price of 1650 yuan to 1638 yuan. Afterwards, the short sellers made profits and covered their positions, so there was a slight rebound. However, it has been not so quick as the previous two days. Therefore, there are many unexpected factors in the future changes. As a result, the prices of the September, October, and November contracts were 1604 yuan, 1623 yuan, and 1644 yuan, respectively, each falling by 18 yuan to 25 yuan. The turnover in the morning was 16,920 bales, a decrease of 750 bales compared to the previous day. The quantity of three-month deposits as of the 28th was 22,720 bales, including 7,390 bales for the September contract, 9,530 bales for the October contract, and 5,800 bales for the November contract. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the morning session are recorded on the left (net prices).</p>
<h3 id="e52">International News Wavering; Cotton Merchants Mostly Cautious <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trading market is narrow, and trading is lackluster. Due to the unstable international situation and the fact that there is still a lot of cotton being held by various parties, while purchase opinions are weak, the foreign cotton order trading seems to be in a calm state. Except for one or two factories that are still continuing to order small amounts of Brazilian cotton and Indian cotton, most of the cotton houses are not enthusiastic and only have a slight intention to collect spot goods.</p>
<p>Only a few traders bought 100 bales of ordinary Rangoon Indian cotton, with the warehouse delivery price falling by 2 yuan to 334 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to mass selling but then rebounded due to trading by industry players and short covering. As a result, the closing price was 3 to 4 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, statistics for American cotton from August 1 to August 29 of this year are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bale):</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to buying by speculators and short covering. It then fell due to selling by spot traders and profit-taking. Finally, the market rose again due to buying by brokers and retail investors. As a result, yesterday's closing prices each rose by about 4 to 5 rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 0.25 rupee today.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Oil Market: Large Volume of Oil Arriving; Oil Merchants Suddenly Panic; Prices Drop Sharply by 7-8 Yuan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large amount of raw bean oil arrived in Shanghai. Since this newspaper disclosed the news, a total of 13,000 cans and 150 barrels have arrived. Therefore, the general oil merchants were panicked, and the rumor of a favorable selling trend spread. As a result, speculators could no longer push up prices, and buying was suddenly dispersed. Under the pressure of many selling, the prices of rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil dropped sharply by 7 to 8 yuan compared to the previous day. It is estimated that more than 3,000 dan of refined oil from the Dayou Factory were sold at a price of 198 yuan to 193 yuan. More than 2,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory, with the September delivery price at 194.5 yuan and the late September delivery price at 205 yuan to 197 yuan. In addition, the office in this district handled more than 200 barrels of raw oil from Qingdao, with the price at 295 yuan, and more than 2,000 cans, with the price at 275 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Miscellaneous Grains: Mooncake Season Unlike Previous Years; Flour Sales Suddenly Clear <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot foreign flour market situation saw a sharp decline. The retail sales in this street were minimal. Moreover, this year's mooncake season is far from what it used to be. The customers are still stagnant. In addition, many retail traders are unloading, and the big wholesalers are also doing so, so the situation is quite weak. The price of Jinlong flour only opened at 31 yuan to 30 yuan 7 jiao, the price of flour from the Pudong warehouse was 31 yuan 2 jiao to 1 jiao, and the price of Paotai flour was 32 yuan 2 jiao to 32 yuan. There was also Xiangjiao flour at 32 yuan 3 jiao to 32 yuan. The turnover was 15,000 to 16,000 bags, with the price falling sharply by about 1 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market situation was also slack and tired. It is learned that a total of more than 500 bags of goods from the suburbs arrived in the past two days and were all taken by the San Xin Factory. The purchase price was still the original price. The Hua Factory still lacked goods to purchase. The market was slightly looser due to the weak flour market.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Piece Goods: Fabric Prices Also Falling Rapidly <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Mill Cloth: Due to the US-Japan negotiations, speculators tended to sell, so the market price was forced to decline. However, the actual sales business in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and this street continued, so the downtrend was alleviated. As a result, the price of coarse and fine cloth and twill fell by 2.5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. The opening prices of bleached and dyed cloth were mixed, with an average drop of 5 jiao. The turnover in this street was more than 300 pieces of various cloths, and 400 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill were sold by the Guangdong and Hong Kong traders.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The selling price fell as a result of the gradual decline in the exchange. As a result, the price of fine cloth fell by 1.2 yuan, the price of medium-grade fine cloth fell by about 1 yuan, the price of fine twill fell by 7.5 jiao to 1 yuan, and the price of Si Jun Zi serge fell by 3 fen to 4.5 fen. The closing price was 2 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen for new orders with new taxes. The price of fine cloth in the exchange fell by 1.3 yuan to 4 jiao for each month.</p>

<p>Trading in the sugar market remained slack yesterday, but market prices remained firm. Most prices rose, and the rise in the prices of lower-grade refined white sugar was even stronger, reaching 4 yuan. The price of 24 coarse white sugar for September 10 delivery was 127.2 yuan, 28.7 yuan, and 27.8 yuan. The price for September 20 was 129 yuan, 29.4 yuan, and 1 jiao, rising 8 jiao to 2 jiao.

<p>The firewood business is very slack in this late summer and early autumn, but because of the currently high prices of wood, small woodworkers have come up with a novel idea. They search for large, round pine logs on the market and saw them into wood for making soap and cigarette boxes, making huge profits. As a result, the goods at the river bank have been almost completely collected, boosting the market, which had been mediocre. Yesterday, the price of large pine logs was 13 yuan per 100 catties, and the price of medium logs was 11 yuan. They were all self-transported from the dock.</p>

<p>Sichuan pepper is now being offered fresh. There were small samples from Nanjing to Shanghai. The goods were good, but the market price must be 300 yuan, which is really high.

<h3 id="e60">Auxiliary Coins Are Not Insufficient for Circulation, But Mostly Not Given to People for Circulation, Unwilling to Let the Public Use Them <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The problem of auxiliary coins in Shanghai, although no serious situation has occurred, the fact is that they are gradually tightening. Since the report was published in this newspaper last time, there has been a saying in banking circles that they are supplied as usual, but it is impossible to verify the facts. All banks have a common problem: the auxiliary coins obtained from the note-issuing bank are often not in the hands of users. They are often locked in the vault in the name of change on the counter. Some are regarded as forbidden by the vault manager, and used to curry favor with superiors and perfunctorily deal with colleagues. However, the counter may tolerate requests from depositors to exchange a small amount, and then respond with an iron face, as if doing a great favor to deal with a few, but most still cannot be exchanged, and are even glared at or even ridiculed a few words. I don’t know why bank employees who are known to be knowledgeable act like this. As for the place where coin notes are most circulated, public buses and trams should be the most popular. They come and go in an endless stream, and most of the time the car is crowded. However, the ticket seller shouted loudly at the door, "I don't have change, if you want me to change, please don't get on the car." Some people get on the car, give him a one-yuan note and ask him to change it, but he says he can't change it, and he is driven down halfway. It is not uncommon to hear about it. Is it possible that all the passengers in the car buy tickets with one-yuan notes? Of course not, they just look for auxiliary coin notes and stuff them in their pockets, unwilling to give change to people. On the one hand, they send many passengers to their company, giving passengers an unpleasant impression. This situation is relatively rare on the public concession trams at present, but in the early years when a dime of silver was equal to ten copper coins, if you used silver to ask him to change it, he would never refuse to find change. Now, for auxiliary coin notes worth more than a dime, they are unwilling to easily give change. However, many cigarette paper shops collect corner tickets, and each 100 yuan is only four or five jiao. Because the vehicles deliberately collect fractional coins, the news spread for a while, which suddenly made the shops tighten their change, and they were unwilling to give change when buying two-jiao items. As a result, the impact spread to the home, and everyone felt a dark shadow of a shortage of auxiliary coins in their hearts. In fact, there is no shortage of auxiliary coins, which is enough for circulation. Most of them are collected by people who want to make a fortune by auxiliary coins. It is not difficult to eliminate this little panic. As long as those who receive and pay large amounts of auxiliary coins circulate the auxiliary coin notes as usual, and do not lock them up, issue them to their counterparts, and be used by them. To supply them to the public, we must do (1) extend the time for direct exchange, (2) entrust more exchange agencies to facilitate exchange. In addition, trams and buses should not accumulate corner tickets, and should distribute them to ticket sellers to meet the needs of finding change. If they refuse to find corner tickets and drive passengers off the bus, or make them buy one less ticket, the company will still suffer losses.</p>
<p>However, having said that, if auxiliary coins are only collected and not released, people will eat anything to satisfy their hunger, and of course there will be those who take advantage of the situation. (Mediocre Words)</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Experimental Middle School of National Central University is Renamed National Fourteenth Middle School, and the Fourteenth Middle School is Subordinated to Central University <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Guiyang Correspondence) The Experimental Middle School of National Central University was recently ordered by the Ministry of Education to be renamed "National Fourteenth Middle School" from the first semester of the 30th year, directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. Yang Baochu (original director of the Experimental Middle School of National Central University) will be the principal. The original National Fourteenth Middle School was reorganized into "Affiliated Middle School of the Teachers College of National Central University" and subordinated to the main campus. The position of director of the affiliated middle school has been decided to be concurrently held by Zhao Tingwei, the dean of the Teachers College. As for the reasons for the renaming and reorganization, Xue Renyang, the secretary of the Experimental Middle School of National Central University, said that because the school is located in Guiyang, which is too far away from the main campus, there are many inconveniences in administration, and the students of the Teachers College have no place to practice. Therefore, the Ministry of Education approved the request of the Teachers College of National Central University to reorganize the Fourteenth Middle School in Yu Qingmu Pass into an affiliated middle school to facilitate practice. Therefore, the relationship between this school and the practice of National Central University has been lost, so it was subordinated to the headquarters and renamed. After using the new name, the experimental nature of the school system is still fully retained, and there is no change in personnel, only the name is changed. In addition, the graduating class before the second semester of the 29th year is still students of the Experimental Middle School of National Central University.</p>

<p>Schools at all levels are about to start the autumn semester. Students are starting to live their school lives. In this extraordinary era, how should we establish our life philosophy and how should we practice frugal living? We should give it some thought and research beforehand. As for the thoughts and behaviors that we thought were good in the past, we should strive to be even better. Only with this spirit of daily renewal can we be worthy of our birth and worthy of the society and the country. The Book of Changes says: "Great men change like tigers, gentlemen change like leopards, and petty men change their faces." I hope students will strive to change like tigers, and at least change like leopards. As for changing faces, it is definitely not an inner awakening and cannot be considered a real change. This newspaper's autumn semester commencement special edition hopes to contribute some ideas to the transformation of students' thoughts and behaviors. Although the articles do not contain lofty ideals, if they can be earnestly implemented, they will definitely have considerable gains.</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Completion of the Spirit of Mutual Assistance <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zongyu</p>
<p>The greatest spirit of mankind is none other than mutual assistance. Because mankind can practice mutual assistance, mankind's power surpasses all animals, and mankind's light is limitless. However, mutual assistance has prerequisites. The prerequisite for mutual assistance is self-help. We must first strive to be enterprising and produce some concrete achievements. Others consider these concrete achievements satisfactory and believe that there is hope for success. At the same time, you discover the difficulties ahead that cannot be solved by your own strength. Therefore, you put forward an appeal for help, which touches the sympathy of others, and they give you assistance without compensation. This is human assistance. Mencius said: "When assistance reaches the extreme, the whole world will submit to it." The ancients believed that much assistance came from attaining the Way. In fact, this Way is not mysterious or abstract, but concrete. The self-help I mentioned above is the Way. Being able to help yourself is attaining the Way. For example, the students of Dazhong Bu Xiao who won the Shen Bao Scholarship are proof of this. If you cannot struggle in a difficult and hardship environment, and struggle to achieve satisfactory results, how can so many enthusiastic people generously donate and provide substantial material assistance?</p>
<p>I hope that all of you who have received the Shen Bao Scholarship this time will work harder in the future. Just like the soldiers at the front, after the reinforcements arrive, the original soldiers should be a hundred times more courageous and charge into battle in order to achieve unprecedented victory. Your academic performance and conduct are all on a higher level. The more effort you put into self-help, the more assistance you will receive from others. This is a definite principle. Conversely, if you mistakenly believe that you have received human assistance and everything can be carefree, and the spirit of self-help gradually declines, and the heat of self-help gradually diminishes, the result will disappoint others, and perhaps the human assistance you have received will be lost!</p>
<p>Even if you can make extra efforts and progress in the future, which is enough to meet the expectations of others, you must also make a determination to practice helping others in the future, whether in spirit or in material, to help others as much as you can. In a narrow sense, you are repaying your gratitude. In a broad sense, you are fulfilling your responsibility as a human being. If you only know how to use self-help to obtain human assistance and are never willing to help others, then you are still inevitably a selfish person. Selfishness and mutual assistance are fundamentally incompatible. From self-help to human assistance, and from human assistance to helping others, the spirit of mutual assistance is promoted. In you, it is a manifestation of a noble personality. In society, it adds several warriors who promote the light. The Shen Bao Scholarship is just an example. Your lifelong actions cannot escape this principle. This is also how a nation is promoted and glorified.</p>

<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>To cultivate character and encourage learning, and to develop useful talents, this is the way to save the country in one's own position. At the same time, use spare time to do social service that you can do and should do, and do it effectively and effectively. You should never just know how to study and not ask about anything else, as if you are detached from society. The following eight points can be used as our motto.</p>
<p>(1) Do until you are old, learn until you are old, and the future is limitless. Do until you are old and teach until you are old, and you will achieve nothing in your life. The former is active and the latter is passive, resulting in a world of difference.</p>
<p>(2) The more you fear difficulties, the more difficult it becomes. If you are not afraid of difficulties, any difficulties will be broken. Since ancient times, there have been many factors that contribute to a person's success or failure, but psychological construction is the most important.</p>
<p>(3) A frank mind eliminates misunderstandings, and openness and honesty dispel doubts. Collective life, although difficult, is easy.</p>
<p>(4) Have a definite understanding, then have a definite mind, have a definite mind, then have a definite strength, and with a definite strength, there is nothing that cannot be destroyed, and nothing that cannot be broken.</p>
<p>(5) Always thinking about the public everywhere and doing your best for the public at all times will definitely gain the sympathy of many people, and it will be very convenient to do things in the future.</p>
<p>(6) Always bring three points of foolishness to doing things, and success will be more likely. Always bring three points of rusticity to being a person, and life will not be extravagant. Young people should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(7) Be able to say it, see it, and do it. Speaking is like writing a check, and every sentence must be cashed. If words and actions are contrary, the more you say, the more you will be despised.</p>
<p>(8) When there is something to do, finish it immediately. When there is nothing to do, look for something to do. The spirit of initiative is manifested here. The spirit of initiative is a yardstick for a person's future.</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Essentials of Learning Methods <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xuan Shan</p>
<p>The author of this article is the Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Bureau. He has given much guidance on the Shen Bao Scholarship for protectors. He is pleased to write this article, which has profound significance. Readers are requested to pay attention. (Editor)</p>
<p>The summer vacation is over and school has started. Dear young people, you have returned from a scattered holiday life to a regular school life. At the beginning of this semester, I would like to talk to you about the essentials of learning methods.</p>
<p>(1) Perseverance: The first condition for learning is to have perseverance. Do not be fickle and do not be intermittent. Everything must go through persistent efforts to develop interest. Learning is also like this. Effort is the mother of success, and success is the source of interest. Old-style education only taught students to study hard and read hard, and completely ignored the interests of the learners, which was of course a miscalculation. But it is also wrong to only talk about superficial stimulation and temporary impulses without cultivating real and lasting interest. True interest arises from continuous and persistent learning.</p>
<p>(2) Proceed in an orderly manner: The second condition for learning is to proceed step by step in an orderly manner and not to skip grades. Being ambitious and seeking quick progress will result in nothing being accomplished. Learning has levels. For example, in arithmetic, if the four operations are not learned well, studying algebra and geometry will inevitably lead to obstacles. The same is true for other subjects. Now there are many young people who like to transfer schools and skip grades, which is a problem of only seeking quick progress without paying attention to substance. "Haste makes waste". We must take this as a warning.</p>
<p>(3) Establish a good foundation: If a house is to be built high, the foundation must be strong. To seek profound knowledge, you must establish a broad foundation. The so-called good foundation, first pay attention to the tool subjects, such as Chinese, mathematics, foreign languages, etc.; second, pay attention to the basic or related subjects, such as those who study education must learn biology, sociology, and psychology; those who study engineering must learn mathematics, physics, etc. A solid foundation will allow you to soar in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Self-directed learning: Perhaps other things can be done by others, but learning can never be replaced by others. Not only must you learn yourself, but also learn actively. You must know that only self-directed learning can obtain real knowledge; only self-directed learning can develop a strong interest.</p>
<p>(5) Seek verification at any time: Building a car behind closed doors may not be in line with the rut when you go out. If you only seek some book knowledge in school, you may not be able to integrate with the society when you serve the society in the future, and there may be problems of incompatibility. A common criticism of students in society is that they are too isolated from the actual situation in society and too out of touch with reality. Therefore, we must pay attention to the situation in society, the changes in society, and the problems in society, and constantly seek verification in experience for what we have learned in school. In this way, the knowledge we seek will not be scratching an itch. And close to reality.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Where the Travels Lead <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Mingqiu</p>
<p>Do you like famous mountains and rivers? You think: of course you like to experience them. This can increase your self-cultivation and expand your mind. In the past, "Zong Shaowen dreamed of traveling to the Five Mountains, and Sun Xinggong remotely composed about Mount Tiantai" can all be thought of in this way. But in the real environment, you are not allowed to be so convenient. How can you increase your self-cultivation and expand your mind on a lonely island? That's right, the autumn semester is about to begin, and you can go to school to take classes again. There is something you admire in school; but when you have free time, you can also go to the following places to enjoy the scenery and breathe. (You must go to places you have not been to during the holidays, and you must still go to places you have been to now.) It can make your</p>

<h3 id="e74">"The Reluctant Dragon" Highlights Record <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>"The Reluctant Dragon" is the fourth elaborate full-length masterpiece by art master Walt Disney, following "Snow White," "Pinocchio," and "Fantasia." It has now arrived in this city and will soon be shown at the Grand Theater. This film features the comedian Robert Benchley playing a timid and muddle-headed "Ordinary Man," depicting his adventure story. In terms of production, from the initial drafting of the outline to the creation of a timeless and interesting story, until the completion of production, it fully adopts the latest and most modern five-color cartoon comedy design and planning. This is indeed a treasure of the art world that cannot be ignored! ——Translator</p>
<p>Here I want to tell you some previously unheard behind-the-scenes tidbits of "The Reluctant Dragon":</p>
<p>"The Reluctant Dragon" can be said to be the first feature film that blends the characteristics of "flesh-and-blood performance" and lively cartoons into one story.</p>
<p>In this film, Walt Disney personally makes a "face-showing" performance, which is the first time ever.</p>
<p>Making Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Mother Goose, Ferdinand the Bull, the Little Mermaid... all have common similarities. They are all "actors" participating in the performance of "The Reluctant Dragon."</p>
<p>Donald Duck often pretends to be a horse when walking into the technical room. In other words, Clarence Nash, who is responsible for Donald Duck's voice, originally came to learn horse neighs.</p>
<p>Walt Disney only uses three fingers and a thumb when painting, which is said to save a lot of time. It can be said to be skill makes perfect.</p>
<p>In the film, you can hear the most wonderful sound effects. At the end of the lingering sound, it suddenly pierces through the clouds and splits the silk, resounding through the clouds, which is unexpected.</p>
<p>In order to control air circulation, more than a thousand windows in the Walt Disney's technicians' building are tightly closed, and none of them are open.</p>

<p>It's the Qixi Festival, and the north and south opera circles are competing to perform the full opera "The Celestial River Match" to celebrate the festival. This custom has been around for a long time and did not start today. This year, among the Celestial River Match performances in the north and south theaters, the collaborative play invited by the Xin Xin Theater in Peiping is considered the best. The talent is at its peak, unparalleled for a time. In this play, Xun Huisheng plays the lead role of Weaver Girl, Li Wanchun plays Cowherd, Jin Shaoshan plays the Golden Bull God, Yan Jupeng plays Zhang Youcai, and Xiao Changhua plays Ga's. Lin Qiuwen, Ren Zhiqi, Zhu Guihua, Li Wenxi, and others play the fairies. It is truly a rare and grand occasion to have such headline-grabbing roles collaborating in one play.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen Where Does the Powerful Family Force a Return?</p>
<p>It is unfortunate in life to be born a daughter, and even more unfortunate to fall into the pleasure quarters, to be picked and folded by others, without freedom. How sad is this? On this day, Yi was sitting alone in her dressing room, hand on her fragrant cheek, sighing sadly. Suddenly, she saw Tian Hongyu walking upstairs. Yi thought the old man was coming to report good news, so she reluctantly straightened her clothes to pay her respects. Tian Hongyu sat down opposite Yi, and the maid brought fragrant tea. Tian Hongyu waved his hand and told the maid to leave. He said to Yuanyuan, "Yuanyuan, today I have something very important to tell you, which you probably couldn't even dream of." Tian Hongyu said this, scratching his head. Yuanyuan thought that this old man only wanted me to be his concubine, what other important things could there be? So, she picked at her nails and asked, "What important matter does Your Excellency have?" Tian Hongyu said, "Let me tell you plainly. My daughter recently saw the Emperor in the palace, and she is always worried about the roving bandits, and the Emperor's face is unhappy, and he is bored all day long, with nothing to relieve him. So, after discussing it with me, she wants to send you into the palace to be offered to the Emperor. Because you are born with a captivating appearance, like a forget-sorrow herb, a flower that understands words, you will surely make the Emperor happy and relieve his worries, so I would rather sacrifice myself and offer you up. You can probably agree to it, right?" When Yuanyuan heard this, it was indeed something she couldn't have dreamed of. Although once you enter the palace gates, it is difficult to leave for the rest of your life, and serving the Emperor is like serving a tiger or a wolf, and you cannot lightly touch the Emperor's sensitive spots and bring disaster upon yourself, but if I marry this old man who is about to die, the doors of the noble family are as deep as the sea, and I will not be able to see the light of day, and it will also ruin my life. Comparing the two, it is of course much better to serve the Emperor. Moreover, I have heard that the current Emperor is a wise and virtuous ruler. After all, I am a commoner, and to become an imperial concubine can be said to be emerging from the mud and ascending to the blue sky. So, she said, "Thank you for Your Excellency's kindness, but I am afraid that I am just a commoner from the lanes, born in the pleasure quarters, and I do not know the palace etiquette, how can I serve the Emperor? It makes me both happy and worried." (156)</p>
