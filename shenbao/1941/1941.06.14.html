<h3>協約國政府聯合宣言　反抗侵略奮鬬到底　願盡力彼此互助求最後勝利　暴力壓迫下絕無和平之可言</h3>
<p>倫敦　協約國政府昨在此間聖詹姆士宮舉行大會、討論一般戰局、旋於各政府代表相繼發言後、通過一決議案、表示協的國一致繼續抗戰之堅强決心、決議案文、曰「大不列顚與北愛·加拿大·澳洲·紐西蘭·南非·比利時·捷克·希臘·盧森堡·荷蘭·挪威·波蘭·南斯拉夫諸政府、及參加抗戰的自由法人領袖特戈爾將軍之代表、議決如下、（一）彼等將繼續奮鬥反抗德義之侵略、直至勝利而後止、彼等將在其奮鬥中盡其力量所可及、彼此輔助、（二）自由人民爲武力所脅持、迫其服從德國或其盟國之宰割時、或自由人民生活於此種威脅以下時、決不能有固定的和平與繁榮、（三）耐久的和平之唯一眞正基礎爲自由人民在免除侵略危害、人人皆享經濟上與社會上安全的世界中之自願的合作、出席者願彼此並與共他自由人民在和戰兩方面共同工作、以達此目的」、</p>
<p>邱吉爾演說</p>
<p>英相邱吉爾發言原文如下、「在反抗納粹主義的戰爭之第二十二月、吾人集議於聖詹姆士故宮、以宣布被蹂躪的歐洲各國合法政府之高尚志趣、並鼓起全世界自由人民之希望、茲置於吾人案前者、有土地橫被侵犯·人民慘遭束縛的十個國家之執業證、而英國海外自治領加拿大·澳洲·紐西蘭·南非·與印度·緬甸·等領土之代表亦咸集於斯、彼等皆爲一種主義拔劍而起、非至一息不存或勝利已獲時決不甘休、當吾人集合於此時、大西洋外傳來美國工廠工作不停之聲、予吾人以鼓勵、吿吾人以時日迅速數量日增的援助之來臨、希特勒所加諸歐洲與世界之慘苦恐怖與罪惡、罄竹難書、華沙·洛特丹·與貝爾格勒之摧毀、乃後世永不能忘的紀念、使人常怵然於以科學殘忍加於無助平民之天空轟炸的暴行、然此僅爲表面可見的損害、</p>
<h3>奴役異族製造傀儡　軸心罪惡罄竹難書</h3>
<p>其尤惡者、厥爲被征服人民之苦楚、旣被束縛又遭恫嚇、且被虐使、千百萬壯丁被迫工作、其狀况幾與奴隸無殊、其所有之物品悉被攫取、或易爲毫無價值之貨幣、其家庭與每日生活無時不爲無孔不入的秘密政治警察所窺探、此種警察不獨使德人自己俯首帖耳、今且遍佈於十餘國之大街與僻巷矣、宗敎信仰備遭壓迫摧殘、以申無神之謬說、而使人崇拜匹夫之專橫、被征服的人民之善良風俗文化法律及其社會與以治機構、非被暴力所消滅、即爲奸險的陰謀所破壞、大陸監獄不敷容納、集中營所人滿爲患、每值黎明、槍聲輒作、捷克·波蘭·荷蘭·挪威·南斯拉夫·希臘·盧森堡·比利時，法蘭西之良民爲其信仰爲其國家、不知已作多少犧牲、而人類永所鄙夷之「葵士林」惡徒、則受僱爲征服者牙爪、雖自己亦呻吟於下、猶爲虎作倀以加害於同咆、凡此听述乃昔日光榮燦爛的歐洲之今日現象、亦即吾人起而與抗者也、</p>
<h3>歐洲秩序根本改造　不容假手於希特勒</h3>
<p>諸位先生此乃希特勒以舉索里尼居其後、達蘭侍其側、所欲憑以從仇恨貪婪中迭成「歐洲新秩序」之基礎、可調荒謬絕倫、今之戰事蔓延日廣、其趨向如何、吾人不能言之、吾人知其爲艱辛並料其歷時長久、吾人亦不能逆計其發展、惟有一事確有把握、無可吾認而爲舉世所共睹者、即歐洲之改造或歐洲國家之聯合、決不出於德人之手是也、任何國家凡爲德國兵警所侵入者、未有不對德人名稱加以仇視、不對納粹主義加以鄙夾者、此種情緒雖歷數百年亦不能肅除之、吾人今尚不並解放如何可至或何時始至、惟事之最有把握者、無過於希特勒所留足跡與所遺指痕、皆將掃蕩一空、而於必要時從地球面上剗除之一事、諸位先生、吾人在此重申其不斷不懈的努力中之團結、務欲解放被覉絆之民族、一年前英政府獨自應付驚濤駭浪、當時吾人仇友似皆以爲吾人壽命爲日有限、英國與其制度將永遠淪陷、</p>
<h3>非至達到作戰目標　英國決不輕易罷兵</h3>
<p>但余可引以自豪而爲諸位先生告者、雖在去年陸軍水編戰具未備、國內幾無一大砲或坦克車、而吾人所有軍需與彈藥幾盡喪於法國之黑暗時日中、吾人從未對於共同主義作片刻之失望，吾人不獨不失望、且在其時向世人宣佈非至被奴隸的各國全數解放與納粹支配完全擊破時、必不媾和之決心焉、諸君試觀目去年六月緊急時期以後、吾人之進行如何、吾人之堅靱力量、已經過可怕之試騐、吾人終爲自已天空之主人翁、今且出擊以逐漸加甚之重創加諸敵方、而我海軍復控制海洋、美國艦隊匿於海港、其勢日蹙、而德國海軍亦大都摧折矣、敵方加諸我國口岸城邑與工廠之殘酷空襲、終無擊破我國民精神銷滅我國家生活、或遏止我戰爭工業擴張之威力、食物與軍械刻安然皇海外運來、沉失船隻之補充、刻正在國內積極爲之、而美國友人於此期我尤多、</p>
<h3>英倫三島砲壘密佈　納粹來犯必遭不幸</h3>
<p>吾人現漸成武裝社會、陸地軍隊在配備與訓練方面皆臻完善、希特勒雖可縱橫歐洲布其兇燄、雖可侵入非洲或進窺亞洲、但終將決雌雄於此滿佈砲壘之英島、吾人決迎之於海陸、無論希特勒往何處、吾人將躡足其後以擊之、吾人空軍將繼續使德國人民瞭盡於戰爭之不盡爲刦奪與勝利、吾人將鼓勵並援助各淪陷國人民之反抗、吾人將粉碎希特勒輩固其所獲之各種努力、希特勒將無和平休息或談判之可得、希特勒如在窘極時作侵犯英島之嘗試、吾人決當作最大之試騐與之周旋、以上蒼之助、吾人必始終不弛其信仰、不懈其職務、至工作完成而後已、諸位先生、余今日對世界各國對擁護自由的各處人民對歐洲四志國及對美洲友人而發者、厥爲奮起爾心、結果爲佳、人類光榮將誕生於憂苦犧牲中」、</p>
<h3>各國代表叙晤一堂　充滿同舟共濟精神</h3>
<p>英王喬治親蒞聖詹姆十宮與英自治領各代表討論、邱吉爾介紹協的國各領袖等與英王相見、代表英國出席與會者爲邱吉爾·艾登·阿特里等諸閣員、協的國除希臘與南斯拉夫以駐英公使爲代表外、皆由　揆親自與會、代表自由法人領袖特戈爾者爲開新、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外相向南美廣播　請協助為自由奮鬭</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日侵晨外相艾登向拉丁美利堅作廣播演說、謂戰事之進行、無論若何久長、若何艱辛、若何猛厲、若何阻滯、而最後勝利必屬吾人、我國今無一人對此懷疑此爲的確的、且將爲決定的英國海陸空軍單個士兵、皆優勝於德義敵兵、此已證明矣、上年七月至十一月間英國之大戰、英空軍曾擊破德機至決心之努力、而德機之數雖遠出我方、終遭失敗、此不過舉其一端可徵耳、英倫及其他各大城或不免遭接續不斷的閃電戰之打擊、但人民並不爲之驚惶、甚至爲此種空前之災難釵起精神、飛機能損毀吾人全國之建築、但炸彈不能擊破國民之精神、吾人今所受美國偉大慷慨之援助、已使協的軍之勝利可操左券、本年一月間羅</p>

<p>斯爾總統致國會之文內稱、渠盼望世界將來以四種自由爲基礎、即言論與表示之自由·信仰自由·免除匱乏之自由·免除恐慌之自由、吾人與協的軍今日之奮鬥、當可使此種更佳生活之高尚概念得以成功、此非國家的戰爭、實爲信仰生活哲學之標準之戰爭、遲早間各人必須決定其立於無論爲光明或黑暗之一方面云、艾登之演說特向旅居拉丁美利堅之英人而發、並申謝若輩對於帝國戰爭努力所作之輸將、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯感受威脅　積極整軍經武　傳納粹大軍集中邊境　企圖迫蘇假道攻近東</h3>
<p>安加位　據土耳其消息靈通人士宣稱、斯達林親任人民委員長之重要結果、卽爲蘇聯軍備運動之加緊、尤其注　於空軍之擴大及現代化、同時若干軍隊中演講者、現語兵士及工人云、紅軍之極爲强大殊屬緊要、俾在必要時可避免或擊退仟何德方之攻擊、以上各演講者在去年十一月莫洛托夫赴德之前、曾警告其聽衆、謂德國係蘇聯之敵人、後莫氏回來、蘇聯政府卽取消此項運動、但至本年一月卽行恢復、並自此以後日趨緊張、此間土方人士皆認蘇聯外交政之主旨、即爲懷懼德國、德人深知此種情形、並以摩爾達維亞之大批羅馬尼亞軍隊爲後盾、大約不久即向蘇政府提出進一步之經濟要求、此間人士皆信斯達林將接受德人要求、因其政策係在延長時間、俾可建成偉大之軍隊及工業機構、以便戰時支持此項軍隊、同方面人士又信希特勒倘使企圖侵犯烏克蘭、史丹林必將加以抵抗、蘇政府對於損及蘇聯中樺之仟何讓步、如德人之管理某項鐵路及工業、皆將加以拒絕、（十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3>公共租界電車又復加價</h3>
<p>當水電煤氣加價案通過施行後，早知與其相關之公州事業，必有聯帶而作加價之舉，尤其爲電氣方面，影響更鉅，牽一髮而動全體，此必然之勢也。果焉今公共租界電車加價又得核准矣；其加價最重要之理由，厥爲該公司收入，未能符合支出之增加情形，而支出增加之最顯著部分，即電費一項，計增四倍有奇；雖尚有所謂時局影響匯價微降等理由，要亦作爲陪襯而已！蓋其主要之原因，仍爲電費。今事已核准，幾同鐵案，事後追論，又復奚益。惟觀於公用事業一再而三加價不已，焉知不有繼電車而加價，又焉知不有藉口於公用事業加價而亦加價，此則造因雖微，而爲果甚大，站在公衆福利文塲上，明知不可與言，徒說何益，然有不容不一言者在焉！</p>
<p>公用事業不能藉口於一般物價之暴騰，而引爲加價之理由，蓋唯一般物價之暴騰，正爲私人經營，只知侔利不顧大局之故也。今公用事業雖亦同爲私人企業，而旣賦以特許專營之權，平時之保護旣周，臨時之綢繆宜早，譬如煤之售於電力公司也。事實上必比市塲價格爲低，非僅爲其有大量銷路也，正爲其售於市塲之煤，轉輾流通，未必立時盡供消費，惟售於電力公司乃不然。再則其他工廠雖亦同有煤之需要，因無電力公司之鉅，乃不得不求之於市塲；若電力公司則日有大量之煤消費，承辦用煤之公司，必規模弘大，設備完全，煤斤揮輸，宜可不受商辦輪船水脚高抬之影響；故市塲煤價雖大漲，而電力公司之煤價，必大異於是，不然，必為其怠於業務上應有之注意矣。是以電力公司以物價騰漲及與市上米煤等相比例，作為加價理由，即不謂之擬於不倫，亦無以折服人心。今電車公司之加價，又追隨電力公司而來，似可認爲正當矣。然而事之合理與吾，不能從文字上以相求，蓋紙面之報告，必千斟萬酌而後出，決無不合之理。電車公司自謂純益自一九三六年百分之八·五，至上年僅為百分之一·三，所落甚鉅，故欲維持其應有之利益，自必出於車票加價以相彌補，此固事理之所或有。但吾人就表面以察電車公司營業，開支雖增，而乘客之擁擠，遠過於戰前者數倍，姑不論實際乘客之有幾何，即就電車公司所售出之車票，以相統計，想必逐年俱增，打破歷年紀錄，此固可以抵銷大部分之開支增加也無疑。平時在中國人腦際中，嘗有一感想，東西方文化思想精神能力，各有所短長，惟獨西人服務精神，管理有方，東方之中國人，確乎無其嚴密規律化。然於電車公司之行車管理，實未敢貿加贊許，蓋乘客常有輾斃車下，殘損肢軀，及發生意外之危險，報章所載，不勝枚舉。且有應停靠之車站而不停，疾駛而過，置招呼於不理；有不待乘客上下完畢而打鈴開車，一不幸即慘禍發作。此皆不能歸咎於乘客之自不小心，而應由電車公司負其責。至於買票出資而常不得票，向之索，竟有徒招侮辱，此則在電車公司前决加價時，各報已多所論列，而電車公司熟視若無覩，充耳若不聞，迄今猶無改善之跡象可見，良可腕惜！在上海電車事業中，買票給票；雖乘客已到站下車，不向之索票，而仍與之票，此種精神，惟於曩時之南市華商電車見之。今電車公司不於其應塞之漏巵，應有之整頓，亟事實行防範改善，而惟加重公衆負担以相彌補，行見票資愈高，垂涎愈甚，弊將愈深，漏巵亦愈流而愈大，誠恐所得仍不足以維持其應享之純益，後此是否又將出於加價之一途？是則層累之加價，徒增公衆以負担，無補於其事業之改善，豈許公用事業獨占之本意哉！故在公衆之立塲上言，公共租界電車，在目前實無有任何之加價理由，足可獲得公衆之諒解。</p>
<p>至於工部局祇據公用事業委員會之呈請，以爲一與特許營業章程之規定，並無不合，應准照辦，一而不念合於特許營業章程之外，尚有與民情相合否；與增加一般乘客之重重負担相合否！電車公司是否盡其最大之努力，於收支力面，盡善盡美，舍加價之外，別無其仙籌補之方法否？又與同一地方內同樣事業之比較，有無相形見絀，或事業有優劣之判，取費有高低之殊否？凡此能經工部局一一緻密考慮審議，並於行車管理各方面，力籌整頓，無使乘客有意外之危險，及乘車之不便，而後核准電車應有之加價，非徒民無間言，亦且額手稱慶，以工部局確能知民意爲重，福利爲懷，謳頌不置矣！</p>

<p>華盛頓　消息靈通方面頃信、美政府恐將向德國致一僅决於戰爭之嚴重抗議、而將要求德方勤沉毀羅賓摩爾船、予以賠償及道歉、至此事件能吾使美德絕交、將視華盛頓柏林、對該船遇禍之確情以及誰爲負責者兩點之意見、是否前趨於一致而定、此一事件、因船員及旅客三十五人迄無下落、而更趨嚴重、柏林對此事、並無任何言論、僅謂德國正在作全部之調查、至於羅總統、其應採何種計劃、自須獲知彼在巴西浦南勃科親往阿梭里阿輪訊問遇難船員之美副領威廉遜之報告後、方能決定、威廉遜將於今日自浦南勃科乘機來華盛頓、其所報告之一部分、已由浦南勃科美領林西肯送達美京云、（十三日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　關於美貨船羅賓摩爾號被轟沉事、美國似將對德採取强有力之外交行動、甚至更强硬之手段、華府各方對於此事、亦多反響、激烈者建議、「用戰鬥艦隊護航、得放砲開火」、溫和者則對德國是否負有羅賓摩爾號沉失之責、表示疑惑、總之、華府現頗關切　事、而報紙業已開始引證先事、即魯西塔尼亞號之沉失、促使美國參加世界大戰是、下院軍事委員會主席稱、「吾人應用戰鬥艦隊護航、聽其放砲開火、試看何人先行放射、何人能擊敗對方」、民主黨參議員康納萊稱、「羅賓摩爾號之沉失、乃無理之攻擊、美政府將取適當手段、以防相類的不幸事件之復起、」民王黨參議員樊紐斯稱、「余意此事須視該船沉沒地點而定、若沉沒地點在危險之海面、或在戰區、或臨近戰區、則吾人不應有過分之激動、但沉沒地、若在和平之海面、則局勢大爲嚴重、」共和黨參議員約翰森謂、「余希望此非若輩屛息以求之不幸事件、」孤立派參議員惠勒稱、「余希望此非主張干涉者所稱總統正在覓取可使吾人參戰的不幸事件之一、美國未準備作戰、而人民亦不欲參戰」、民主黨參議員艾列遜稱、渠不信國務院確知羅賓摩爾號被德潛艇擊沉云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國消息靈通界昨日稱、柏林軍界並未接獲任何報告、是以證明美貨輪「羅賓摩爾」號在南大西洋沉沒、係德潛艇所爲、此等方面稱、此事現在偵查中、惟彼等甚不信德潛艇能作此事、因「果爾、則此間軍界至今自應得報告」書、自「羅賓摩爾」號事件發生以來、德方報紙及無綫電台、並無隻字之提及云、（十三日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務幫辦威爾士昨宣布、「美貨船羅賓摩爾號、係遭德潛艇擊沉無疑、而該潛艇艇長深知羅賓摩爾號爲美船」、衆料此項宣布、將在美國引起嚴重反響、威爾士昨日招待新聞記者時、神氣嚴肅、謂據駐巴西浦南勃科美領事林西肯發來之報告、羅賓摩爾號乃被德潛艇擊沉無疑、威爾士並官讀美領事根據羅賓摩爾號脫險船員十一人所述而繕具之報告書概要、稱、「羅賓摩爾號、係五月廿一日午前六時、（格林威樞時間）在北緯六度十分、西經廿五度四十分之地沉沒、潛艇長深知該船爲美船、脫險者均康健、其所述者已錄下、其概要俟譯成電碼後、即將發來、船員失蹤者三十五人、」戚爾士又稱、羅賓摩爾號所載之貨、並無戰具或與中立法不符之其他軍用品在內所載各貨、種類繁多、自鋼軌以至女襪、且有汽車與汽車零件等多種物品、擬運往非洲之羅倫科馬基斯、伊利沙白港、開浦鎭、與東倫敦、渠未接詳報故現未能置評云、或問美政府、對此事件是否抱嚴重見解、威爾士拒不置答、羅斯福總統秘書歐萊稱、今似不復有保留判斷之理由、預料星期一日可有消息、或稍遲亦未可知、因須經此間官員研究後、始決定取何行動也云、此間審愼之觀察家、預料官方之宣布羅賓摩爾號、係遭德潛艇故意擊沉、將引起全國之反響、美政府之重視此事、可由威爾士之言見之、許多人士之印象、以為威爾士之言、或係準備進行重大發展之初步、雖作羅賓摩爾號事件、將直接促使美國參戰之想者尚少、但此事可使美感國民心作準備參戰之步驟、則無疑問、以其已將戰事引至美國門前也、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>雅納爾宣稱　美與德日　須同時交綏　美國之邊境在亞洲　宜速採取攻勢行動</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾海軍大將、頃撰文載華盛頓郵報稱、英國不敗、則美海軍實力、即足在兩洋作戰、但必不能仍取守勢、歐洲事件刻正迅速移動、美國之積極參戰、僅係時間問題、日本與柏林締結條的、實即不顧美國之希望、而戰事將波及遠東之謂、日本若能圓滿侵入荷印、則白種人在遠東休矣、故新加坡對美與英同樣軍要、吾人所須接受之事實、爲吾人若與德國作戰、（此乃吾人將爲與應爲者、）亦須與日本交綏、吾人明瞭此點愈早、而有準備、則愈於吾人有益云、雅氏旋述有利於美國之因素、如利用新加坡菲島與荷印之港口、以及英方與荷印之海陸空根據地是、繼稱、中國現已牽制百萬日兵、若獲接濟、更能加緊作戰、台灣之日方根據地、頗易轟炸之、日本之海上貿易、將告終止、而日方須在距本國根據地二三千哩外作戰、渠主張美國亟應利用軍事勝利之基本原則、即取主動與攻勢是、今日之美國艦隊、較諸德日若在歐亞兩洲得逞後、一九四六年時美艦隊之實力爲强、但美艦隊必須在邊界作戰、並依照海戰原則、美國若求戰勝、則不能留艦隊於本國海面、但須在邊界上採取迅速決斷之攻勢行動、太平洋中之美國邊界、乃在亞洲東南部云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美總統考慮　禁油運日</h3>
<p>紐約　據接近政府方面本日語紐約消息論壇報稱、美國現正考慮應否停止以油類運往日本、如羅斯福總統實行此舉、則紐約及東海岸全部所擬議之實行限制汽油及燃料之使用、將可較寬、並將可防止供給住宅辦公室及工廠等取暖所用之燃油有缺乏之虞、因而可防止汽油價格之上漲云、（十三日合衆電）</p>
<h3>解除東海岸油荒</h3>
<p>華盛頓　內務部長伊克斯昨告新聞記者、美國東部之油限制似爲不可避免之事、渠希望一二星期內可擬就民事上用油保持之計畫、渠已請航務委員會告以現懸外旗之美人油船及可否勒令其服務、以解東海岸油荒、據油業中人言、伊克斯計畫旨在阻止今冬之油荒並許油源之運往日本（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>日傳英美對泰越　將使外交壓力　禁止煤油貨品運往日本　芳澤斥荷印漠視新秩序</h3>
<p>東京　「日日新聞」今日之河內特訊稱、英美兩國乘巴達維亞談判陷於僵局之機會、在越南及泰國作聯合之活動、以增加其對日之經濟封鎖、該消息稱、美國對荷印加以壓力、企圖禁運煤油往日、同時、英國亦在目前、對泰國壓迫、以所有擬運日本之貨品、供給英國、該報謂、英美之「商界」、聞與華商合作、阻止泰國及越南來之出口運日、「日日新聞」稱、西貢輸日之米運、最近受阻、而越當局竟提議將六七八月份出口之米運、截阻一半、該報復載盤谷之特電、謂英國以煤油供給爲餌、企圖遏阻泰國橡皮及錫之出產、以阻止此項原料入於日本曁其他軸心國家之手云、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　日本派往荷印談判商務之代表團團長芳澤、昨日發表談話宣稱、關於荷印人士所發言論、謂恐日本將荷印貨物、重行輸往德國之說、乃東亞各民族、不願合作、藉口、芳澤力言、荷印係企圖不承認「東亞新秩序」、此乃日荷商務談判破裂之眞正原因云、（十三日海通社電）</p>
<p>東京　情報局發言人石井今日接見新聞訪員時官稱、現有專家、依照本月十一日政府所決定對付荷屬東印度之政策、草擬致芳澤之訓令、是日政府會議、不特考慮荷印對日之態度、且曾計及國際大局、俟芳澤收到此項訓令後、該訓令內容即將發表、並附以政府宣言、有問以在最後訓令發出之前、是吾將召回芳澤者、發言人置之不答、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　今日得悉巴達維亞日總代表芳澤、與讀賣新聞在無綫電話交談時、曾稱、因荷屬東印度當局現取强硬態度、其覆文乃屬最後性質、故已無妥協之餘地、雖某某數點經解釋後已見轉佳、但尚不足使談話得以轉園、荷印當局之覆文、乃由東印度議會審愼研究後決定者、今已無續取任何步驟之餘地、故在渠本月二十九日啟程回國之前、無再晤荷印當局之必耍、荷印民衆與各報現皆竭力贊助政府所取之强硬態度、故渠信局勢將逐漸加重困難、芳澤吾認日僑撤退消息、謂日僑並未作總撤退之準備、巴達維亞日總領事現勸日僑鎭靜自處、芳澤又謂談話失敗之根本原因、乃由荷印當局不明瞭世界大局、與東亞刻在變遷中之秩序、今日之局勢、爲日本不能漠然置之、亦不能容其繼續存在云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美方認日蘇新約　並無重要價值　日方目的僅在欺騙民衆</h3>
<p>華盛頓　商務官員昨信、蘇日新議定之商務條的、實爲抵銷日荷間商務談判之失敗而設、專家深疑蘇日兩國、果有何項軍事要物、足以大量交換者、僅石油一物、或者蘇俄可自樺太島運往日本、惟蘇聯能供給日本之油量、比諸日本之平時需要、終屬甚微、故衆信蘇日商務談判、不過爲形式上一種象徵、以滿足日公衆對於蘇日締結互不侵犯條的後之要求專家又謂蘇聯之錳礦、產於高加索、距日本過遠、運費奇昂、蘇肥料出產區、蘇距日本三千至六千英里、運輸不便、白金產量亦不重要、至日方能供給者、爲大量之絲、對蘇聯除製降落傘外、殊無大用、而日本缺乏機械、亦不至供給蘇聯以重要機械云、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>莫期科　日本方面、昨日對蘇日貿易協定表示滿意、彼等稱、正式協定之成立、爲時不遠、又稱、兩國現皆正以「互相讓步」之精神、在進行中、蘇方報紙、評論此事、謂已放下解決兩國間重要懸案之基礎云、（十三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>蓋達對美　提出警告</h3>
<p>羅馬　義相喉舌蓋達、昨日在義大利日報撰文稱、美國參戰將有兩大後果、一爲延長央國之抵抗、一爲促使日本出而干涉、蓋達云、「美國出而干預戰事、僅約使戰事延長、因屆時美國艦隊將在大西洋及地中海上聽命于英國、而增加毀滅、屆時日本亦將參戰、軸心國雖從未有攻擊美國之意、惟華盛頓如自動參戰、則軸心亦不得不有所反應也」、（十三日合衆電）</p>

<p>倫敦　據叙利亞最近之官方消息稱、協的軍續獲重要之進步、現正包圍叙利亞三大城、即大馬色·貝魯特·阿勒波是也、英空軍繼續協助陸軍挺進、並曾轟炸散駐德人所管阿勒波飛機塲之飛機、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間消息、自由法軍已開入基斯威、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>開羅　叙利亞境內協的軍一面儘可能範圍避免戰事、一面賡續前進、已抵古城西桐之郊外、及大馬色南郊距城十哩處、法軍主要抵抗地在沿海里太尼河渡頭與瑪吐賴以北、阻擋向大馬色前進中之中路協的軍、經步槍與長射程砲隊轟擊後、法軍已被擊敗、投降者半數、均表同情於協的軍、現協的軍雖進抵法總督鄧資將軍所屬法軍集中之區、但此間人十謂維希公報所稱「戰况激烈」一節、全屬過甚其詞、開羅方面相信維希或係故意發出誇張消息、以作投降張本、迄今尚無自由法軍與叙境法軍交戰之訊、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間最近所接之消息、叙利亞協的軍隊現櫃續滿意之進展、彼等巳經抵大馬色近郊之說、此間尚無證明、自由法軍現正在大馬色以南的十哩之地、作迂迴行動英軍已在該區佔領兩村、在該地中心已越過摩迦索、其失陷已於昨證實、按摩迦索爲叙利亞邊境哨信之總部、已由英國與帝國軍隊未發一彈在的丹流域之起源處、純粹維希軍隊之反抗、法方主力部隊已向北退却、祇在克漢姆後方之叢山中、僅留孤軍之抵抗、近三日來英軍曾盡力避免流血、一再派使者手持白旗、至法軍處要求投彈、旋因求和無濟卽行進攻、並在數小時之後、保障至貝魯特之重要據點三處、已被英軍佔領、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間消息稱、自由法軍藉機械化隊及英皇家軍隊之支助、已於今晨抵大馬色之外圍、又稱、目下聯軍距該城中心、僅有如一公共汽車行駛十五分鐘之途程、又一消息稱、大馬色之維希官吏業巳逃往阿勒波、形成長串之摩托運輸車及特別火車、已在載運彼等北去、人們對聯軍進入大馬色之預料已有三日之久、至今此項預料始呈確定性、並料屆時聯軍必爲以和平之姿態入城、必無抵抗之事、此項信念係基於開羅所傳聯軍已向法美叙官員鄧資提出建議、令彼軍於聯軍進入時勿事抵抗、俾可保存此富有歷史性之城市不致受損、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫教　據悉、沿海前進之一隊、已在西桐之外圍並已趨向貝魯特、而據另一報告、則謂西桐周圍廣大之橘林·杏園·香蕉園及檸檬園等地、戰事正在淮行、據各種特殊消息而觀、聯軍此時所逢之事、乃係自里奈尼河北激戰後、已再向西桐進發、但爲藏匿洞穴樹林、岩石等之法國軍隊截成數段、此一局勢、最後乃經肉搏戰而克服、而進展於是再繼續、然若干軍隊、顯然必須於此距貝魯特二十英里之西桐周圍繞道前進、至佔領摩迦索之一隊、嗣卽抵哈斯·巴雅·現聞已向東進攻大馬色、此一隊抵大馬色外圍之軍隊、或係在等候他軍抵達後人城、至於自伊拉克攻叙之兩隊則尚無新鮮之消息、今日此間人士、於獲知維希承認鄧資軍隊已放棄其踞以抗拒英軍中隊之主要設防地點摩迦索後、咸料叙里亞南境之法軍抵抗、不久即可崩潰、衆信此佔領摩迦索之一隊、必在北攻拉雅克或已向東北攻大馬色、此間父信海軍飛機之察襲貝魯特、足以表明在沿海公路進行之一隊、必在繼續進展、或可迅速佔領貝魯特、非官方人士謂英軍業已進入西桐郊外甚深遠之地點、基斯威之法軍仍在頑抗聯軍、而自由法軍則圖自南面攻克大馬色、此一隊伍、聞仍在與防軍激戰云、（十三日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　法官方通信社昨日午後聲稱、進抵叙利亞西桐城前之澳軍、尚未能擊破法軍之抵抗、現戰况激烈、英艦且不斷猛轟海岸法軍在西桐四週橘林中據場扼守、澳軍進攻有坦克車與艦隊重砲助戰、該艦隊計戰艦一艘、巡艦二艘、與驅逐艦五艘轟炸該港已歷三日、法驅逐艦迎戰、彈中英輕艦兩艘、摩迦榮之後方續有戰事、法軍星期三日退出摩迦榮、在城後五六哩處據守堅强陣地、叙利亞首邑大馬色前之特戈爾軍、昨攻大馬色以南十五哩之吉索、惟據最近消息、特戈爾軍進攻已被擊退云、倫敦方面維希所發戰况激烈之消息、或係故意傳佈、以促進法德方面所擬消除法人對英同情之計畫、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英政府　答覆維希抗議　聲明對叙無領土野心　維希昨提出二次抗議</h3>

<p>維希　貝當元帥昨晚仍在力謀與英言和、以結束叙里亞之衝突、並暗示英若冉欲佔此法國委治地、則法國將與德爲更密切之合作、法政府會以一牒文、令瑪德里之法駐西大使比雅特里遞與英駐西大使賀爾、向英提供叙里亞之和平、欲英承認指責法國許德佔領叙之錯誤、而繼以立即撤軍、該牒文已爲叙里亞戰爭以來法國所致之第一次通牒、雖官方暗示此第二次之法國抗議、較爲和平、但合衆社所知、此項牒文之語氣、反絞第一次爲强硬、該牒文於反覆申述叙里亞並無德軍、力言英國車今旣能證明叙境無一德軍、實已無繼續其戰爭之理由、其結語則係合前後兩次牒文之意旨而成、謂英軍於旣證明其所稱德軍業已佔叙之語鳥謬誤後、而仍事侵略、則唯一之結果、惟有加强法國與德在歐洲合作之決心而已、（十三日合衆電）</p>

<p>紗花　　迴旋之途、此因實際交易不及上日之旺、加之荷印間題　為緊張、以致浮多軟化、惟有一部份如果局勞嚴重、原料恐生問題、所以依然採取逢跌時收買做多、而市上棧單仍乾涸、掉期賣方貼出二角半至七角半、然空頭心思甚濃、至於多方因有利息收進、亦無放出之念、所以雙方陣容、非常堅固、等待時機發展、恐生大變化也、二十支雙馬高價跌一千四百六十五元、低價為一千四白五十八元、午後初做一千四百六十一二元、最後價爲一千四百六十五六元、成交不旺、不過人心尙昂、今日有紗四百二十包運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因荷印談判決裂、空方活躍檯面帶虛、首緊價爲一千四白六十元、然大戶仍進、不過搶帽子之輩、大都放出、少頃跌至一千四百五十八元、旋以金價平平、雙馬仍有交易、人心　振、又漲至一千四百六十五元、但中途形態平庸、在六十二三元之間往返多時、收盤價爲一千四百六十二元、查半日間成交統計九千八百七十包、內香港幫進二百七十包、　行九千六百包、</p>
<p>金變馬標紗市況、處於迴旋之境、市態極具穩靜、七月期比上月跌五元半、八月期跌二元、市塲成交較上日爲减、全日的計八千餘包、茲將其一日間高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉市飛騰</h3>
<p>米特林售價近四百六十元　現棉情况、依然堅挺、廠方近來紗銷不弱、對於原料時時而進、至於同業鑒於國際局勢緊張、顧慮將後來源發生障礙、所以心思一致向上、細絨價格復創新峯、粗絨本花亦隨之而起、做開現棉打情列左、</p>

<p>另訊　滬埠洋行外棉交易、廠需甚殷、抵補頗力、同時同業觀於海外採購水脚昂貴、人心一致看高、因之連日市况活躍、成交衆多、昨除米特林售價近四百六十元左右外、其餘已西棉與印棉均頻頻挺進、巴西棉爲二十二支原料者、某外商紗廠竟以四百三十元之高價成交三百件也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業買進而漲、但續後又因反動售出及雨水調勻、而回跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日的跌上磅音左右、</p>
<p>印棉停市、預測今日開盤市况、看小一羅比左右、</p>
<h3>疋頭　期貨廠布　開價甚緊</h3>
<p>廠希　昨市續堅、同業心思良好、客銷以杳港南洋一路獨暢各布廠期貨開價甚緊、英商怡和廠開期額粗布二千餘　、售盤白貨漂染布大市不動、一部份漲每疋二角半、本街成交各布五百餘件、粤港南洋幫辦漂布粗布等四百餘件、十四日運香港疋頭三百七十件、</p>
<p>東布　市勢平定、升降殊微、白貨細布仍軟、龍頭廠棧單收盤價爲四十四元六角、惟四君子嗶嘰則以囤戶搜辦、價續堅挺、晚收一元四角五分六二五、較漲每碼五厘</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白平穩</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤、二四粗白外棧新貨九十一元至九十二三元、後回小至九十一元五角、尙有三四月份到貨爲九十元·九十一元·九十一元五角、旋至九十元零五角至九十元、太古B嘜一百零八元、DY九十五元、HK八十八元五　、荷赤莉七—元·六十九元至七十一元·七十元零五角、老貨六十八元、比之前市新粗白好起五角、老貨升一元半、聞下午塲外交易、粗白仍見疲勢、又糖今日有一千五百包、山香港來　往天津、昨日由爪哇運到三千五白噸、</p>
<h3>期糖交割　可望吿一段落</h3>
<p>期糖交割、以本期市價上落太鉅、人心頗難安定、故由該會執監委員會開會商議折衷辦法、買賣掉雙方交由公會彙總交割、刻大部份已吿竣事、僅有極少數、未將款項送會、諒最近期內當可交淸、如是則全部可望吿一段落、</p>
<h3>五金　美馬口鐵大俏　行情漲至五百元　黑鐵坯子存底薄</h3>
<p>二百磅與一百八十磅美雙連馬口鐵、　來異常挺秀、乃係犬津幫客　搜羅甚勁、本街製罐廠印刷廠等納胃亦不寂、開價一再昂騰、昨市如一百八十磅每箱由四百六十元售至四百八十元、二百磅貨更由西百八十元漲至五百元、較前均各漲二十元之巨、且流迪貨十分軋缺、躉批交易一時無從搜集、</p>
<p>黑鐵坯子、因海外來源吿絕、本市存底父稀、經本街之廠家與同業相率成交後、市况蓬勃、現貨益覺不敷、人心高昂、行情亦隨而步昂、昨　紮二千磅新鋼廠貨售三千五百元、老鋼廠貨每捆須三千六百元、比前又漲起達一百元有奇、</p>
<h3>煤炭　同得利煤回升</h3>
<p>同得利白煤、自某洋行分銷以後、盛傳舊經理行某公司亦有新貨將到、同業行拆、勢將競爭、暗盤一度低落、近日來仍未能見之事實、人心復熾、趁低購進、老單價開四百三十二元、又漲十餘元行情、現車較盤略形便宜、</p>
<h3>藥材　藥芡猛漲</h3>
<p>藥芡近以到存軋缺、貨底感覺單薄、同時銷方需要至爲活潑、因此價格再度猛漲三四十元、昨市行盤如白皮藥芡售至二百元、紅皮芡亦達一百六十九、市勢挺秀、</p>

<h3>美敎士自陪都來滬　述中國民氣蓬勃　不畏艱苦涵蓄無限力量　必可建立理想的新中國</h3>
<p>美籍敎士傑姆士、頃由渝轉港來滬、對自由中國之蓬勃氣象、極表樂觀、並深信中國人民必能獲取眞正自由、而能建立理想的新中國、昨日大光社記者訪謁之於某旅次、承告各節、特錄如下、</p>
<p>忍受痛苦　意志堅強</p>
<p>余（傑姆士氏自稱）自於前年冬季赴渝後、即居於離重慶十餘里某山旁之敎堂內、該敎堂後面、即為華人醫院、內多為被炸傷之傷兵及無辜民衆、余平日必赴該院內巡視一週、對傷兵加以安慰、然彼輩意志、均極堅強、對摧殘彼輩之人、極表憤怒、而自身之痛苦、却置之度外、</p>
<p>建設精神　令人驚異</p>
<p>某天、遭受日機轟炸、斯時余適在城內、目擊巨型炸彈落於平民窟中、只見火光冲天、但該區居民已於第一次警報時遺散、故死傷極微、僅毀平房二百餘間、余對一片瓦礫、深爲不忍、但三日後、於余第二次至城內時、該處發現極爲整齊草房二百餘間、已不復有斷坦殘壁、後經探問、始悉該區居民於日機去後、即將毀壞木料運去、當晚計劃興建工作、其建設精神及敏捷行動、實使人欽佩、</p>
<p>團結奮鬥　絕對光明</p>
<p>最後傑氏謂全國人民、若能在蔣介石將軍領導下繼續團結奮鬥、則前途絕對光明、理想之新中國、必能產生、一切非正常之狀態、亦能予以消滅、中國爲余十餘年之老友、余深信老友能獲得眞正之自由獨立與平等、</p>
<h3>工部局職員加薪案　鄭重審議　局方組織特委會研究</h3>
<p>關於工部局職員加薪問題、工部局曾於十一日例會中提出討論、傳銓叙委員會之意見、除贊同職員之要求外、並建議高級職員加薪二成、本市各界、以去年十一月工部局全體加薪結果、曾增稅四成、加重全市負擔、刺激物價上漲、日影響工潮之蔓延與擴大、並迭成工部局本年預算不敷之後果、故對該一問題、甚爲重視、並發表言論、請當局嚴加注意、聞是日會議席上、對職員要求、除表同情外、亦深感本年度預算不敷九百萬元、甫經舉債、渡過難關、如循職員要求、則無此經費、又將以何法開源、如再增重市民負擔、必致引起一般反感、故決議將該案保留、並組織特別委員會、交付審議、該會之任務、爲（一）研究開源辦法、（二）決定加薪比例、（三）注意對一般社會所發生之影響、俟擬定具體方案再行提出討論、昨日曾有西報記者將該一問題、詢之工部局發言人、據稱、此事目下尚不能有所發表、但不久可望有正式文告發出、</p>
<h3>錢兌業大同行照費　暫准核減</h3>
<p>據工部局發表、查關於錢兌業請求核减照費一案、刻經本局董事會議決、准將此項照費由每季一百二十元（依照店面每闊十二呎計算）减至每季七十五元、一面本案留待「新稅源委員會」價而考量、按此類錢兌商店、目下的有六十九家、</p>
<h3>郵局鉅刦案嫌疑犯　呈請懲處　贓款尚未交還郵局點收</h3>
<p>郵政管理局鉅刦案、自經日憲兵隊、迅速破案後、賊款二百萬元、即經全部起出、惟日方對此款、尚在保存中、現由郵局總巡員岡田、交涉折衝、關於解送該款之儲匯局人員、計有出納科主任王勗初、保鏢二人、老可務三人、仍覊押於虹口永安銀公司舊址、郵局將呈報總局、分別情節、予以懲處、</p>
<h3>基督敎行政委會　昨日開始　到代表二十餘人</h3>

<h3>法籍律師達商　昨晨被刺身死　在事務所扶梯畔遇刺客　共中三彈畢命救護車上</h3>
<p>法籍名律師達商、突於昨晨在公館馬路被狙、旋因傷重斃命於救護車中、據法租界境內自有狙擊案以來、除公黃局法律顧問杜格被狙殺外、此爲第二入、爰將該案經過情形誌後、</p>
<p>執行律務　已三十年</p>
<p>法籍名律師達商Rdauxionde　Ruffe現年六十六歲、法之電米省人早歲卒業於巴黎大學法律系、得法學博士學位、一一度充任西貢法院法官、卅年前來滬、執行律務、爲出庭法公廨之第一律師、事務所設於公館馬路四十一號二樓廿七號內、而庽所則在馬斯南路五十四號、平日置有一一九二三號目備汽車代步、</p>
<p>身中三彈　均在要害</p>
<p>昨晨、達早餐後、身御米色西裝、戴籐製之草帽、於八時半後出門登車逕赴事務所、循例辦公、當車抵四十一號門口、時正鐘鳴九時、達乃啟門而出、步入該號、拔步登梯、不料斯時已伏有男子四人、其中一人且在梯畔守候、瞥見達上、遂出手槍、向達連開三槍、均中胸部、立即倒於梯畔血泊中、奄奄一息、</p>
<p>年邁力衰　中途畢命</p>
<p>迨附近崗捕得訊、急電告捕房、派遺大批中西探捕馳往、在出事地點四週臨時施行戒嚴、嚴密搜查、惟開槍者已於出事後遠遁無蹤、致未獲得同時法捕房高級人員如總監法勃爾·刑事部長萬朗登·等亦均於事後親自蒞塲察勘時達已不能言語、乃急舁登救護車上、擬往廣慈醫院急救、無如達已年邁力衰、兼之流血過多、即在車中殞命、</p>
<p>達商屍體　送騐屍所</p>
<p>事後、由法捕房移送台拉斯脫路騐屍所待騐、法捕房因案悄重大、旋即將達事務所之茶役江榮堂等傳往捕房訊問、藉供綫索、一而將檢獲之彈壳畀專家檢騐、旋於中午派員又將達之事務所暫予封鎖、據悉、達之長女現居靑島、其姘則在本埠華比銀行服務、達除備有一一九二三號汽車外、尚有六一五號一輛、</p>
<p>梅丁女士　目擊其事</p>
<p>又據英文大美晚報消息、當出事時、上海法文日報職員梅丁女士亦在塲、聞達商呻吟曰、「若輩開槍一響、擊中余頸」、梅丁問事是否見行兇者、答曰、余不知何人開槍」言訖氣若游絲、移時巡捕聞警馳到、並召到救護車一輛、將達商飛送廣慈醫院、中途氣絕、警方昨晨本能披露此案動機、查達商旅華已逾四十年、多居上海、常撰文刊英法文「極東」雜誌、達商以一八七八年生於巴黎、卒業索朋納大學後、執行律務、曾任西貢法官、世界大戰入陸軍、身經凡爾登等大戰役、獲軍事勳章、戰後返滬、重操律務、一度任上海法國參戰軍人會主席、生平所著關於遠東事件與中法藝術之書籍頗多、曾任法國菲加羅報等遠東訪員、</p>
<h3>美徵用船隻事　暫時絕無影響　各總統輪航期依然有效　徵船詳細計劃猶待研究</h3>
<p>美國總統輪船公司某員昨稱、日前通訊社傳美政府徵用航行遠東之載客輪、上海方面乃對遠東與北美太平洋海岸間航運、有所焦念、未免失諸過慮、通訊社所傳消息、固可表示一般大局無疑、然未能認爲可靠、</p>
<p>駛滬輪隻　不致驟減</p>
<p>本埠美國總統輪船公司除見通訊社所傳者外、絕未接獲其業務將减縮之證實消息、故現行各輪航期、依然有效、而船票照常預售、毫無保留、政府接　商船之說、確屬事實、自無疑義、而美國總統輪船公司當然將受影響、惟料至少在短期內駛滬輪隻、不致驟减、</p>
<p>徵船辦法　尚未擬定</p>
<p>該公司深知美官塲對世界大勢之反響、必牽連行駛遠東之航業、故現待舊金山總公司有具體消息傳來、而迄今尚未接此具體消息一事、足見徵船計劃之詳細辦法、未曾擬定、遠東之美輪航菜、日後將受若干限制、或係無可避免者、但本埠總統公司人員以爲縱受影響、亦不甚巨、蓋他家輸船公司業已擔當政府徵船之壓力、而總統公司各輪、現已不容缺少一艘、除非在嚴重之緊急狀況下、其業務不致減縮、</p>
<p>各輪船票　照常預定</p>
<p>抑邇來船舶喪失之巨、空前未有、而各國皆爲生存搏鬥、則任何事件、俱有發生可能、如平時航行遠東之昌興公司「皇后」級郵船、自耶誕節起、即已停駛、各船俱被英當局徵用、總統公司人員末稱、今尚過早、未能獲得結論、迄今爲止、絕無正式消息傳到、故該公司船票照常預定最近將來、可望不致起重大變化、</p>
<h3>戲院特別門票　免征娛樂捐</h3>
<p>據工部局公告、界內各戲院以特別門票、發給穿着制服之人員者、則此類門票、得免征娛樂捐、</p>

<p>昨日離滬之卜舫濟博士</p>
<h3>業餘體育會歡送　查瑞龍出國</h3>

<h3>記藝術家張充仁</h3>
<p>— 紹</p>
<p>名藝術家張充仁，造詣極深，早歲留學法比，以第一名卒業於比京皇家美術院，獲比皇亞爾培金章，爲國爭光，我駐比使館特頒三吉獎章，以資鼓勵。其歸國個展，即轟動我國藝壇，時新華藝專校長徐朗西氏偕藝界名流前往評覽，見其雕刻·油畫·水彩·鉛筆諸作，無一不造其極，嘆曰：此藝術界之全才也。時吳鐵城·孫科·蔡孑民·葉恭綽·黃漢樑及諸愛好藝術者，蒞臨參觀，爭購其畫，出品爲之搜求一空。</p>
<p>此次展覽後，張氏又復埋頭畫室，深居簡出，每作一畫，從不肯以畫件之堆積，苟且了事，一畫旣成，又必爲私人購藏，致氏五年來未開個展。藝界同好，相與催促，不得已乃將雕刻繪畫之散藏於滬濱者，重復搜集，自六月十五至十九日，在靜安寺路西靑年會（國際飯店隔壁）公開展覽。據張氏語人曰：「余每五年一展，已覺費事，」則此决集精品於一堂，誠愛好藝術者一飽眼福之機會也。上圖爲張氏油繪創作「惻隱之心」，作者立畫前，驟視之疑是畫中人，蓋其畫生動逼眞，可想見也。</p>
<h3>夏令衛生運動</h3>
<p>靑年會主辦之夏令衛生健康運動、於昨日下午二時、在八仙橋會所正式開幕、雖不舉行儀式、但各界到會參觀來賓、殊爲踴躍、陳列品計有圖表統計、病原、病理、預防、顯微鏡、健康要素等、下午並有體格檢查衛生演講、入晚並有遊藝及電影、會期三天、明日下午十一時閉幕、</p>
<h3>香港接濟滬市米糧　將改用敏黨米　惟工部局未有正式表示　其售價或將再予以核減</h3>
<p>據新聲社記者昨向洋行界探悉、本市各洋行昨接獲香港同業電告、香港政府鑒於仰光小紋米去路轉廣、存貨已較前稍减、但敏黨米則因來源蟬聯、加以去路不强、故存貨充實、刻已下令暫禁小絞米轉運外埠、惟敏黨米則准大量出口、港政府直接供給滬工部局之仰光特別小絞米亦在禁例、港府已電滬工部局、嗣後運滬平米、將更易爲仰光敏黨洋米、並首批可於七月份裝輪啟運來滬、又據米業界透露消息、港政府所供給之仰光特別小絞米、最後一批可於本月十九日抵達此間、惟工部局對於上述各節、尚未向外正式表示、據一般人稱、當局對於敏黨米在滬發售價格、或將再度設法抑平、</p>
<p>平米並不兜銷</p>
<p>工部局　　舉辦之仰光特別敏黨米、米樣已於日前由港帶滬、存置立基與祥茂兩洋行、以供米業界於訂購時得以察看成色、現已開始訂購、又據舫業界消息、昨日上午十時抵埠之阜生輪、載有平價小絞米一萬包、停泊羅斯福碼頭、此外尚有元生裕生太原寗海叫輪、各載有平價小絞米一萬包、亦將於日內抵埠、近聞有不肖之徒、利用平米代辦機關職員名義、以某種貨物前往各米行號兜售、且索價甚昂並少數米行號以人情難却、購置者業已有二十餘起、迄至昨日、平米代辦職員始行發覺、聞業已普遍通知各米行號、聲明平米代辦機關職員、並無在外兜售仟何貨物、望各米行號勿再受愚、</p>
<p>運米車工被捕</p>
<p>大光社云、本市米運經工部局政治部調解、規定小宗米糧、概由小車承運、大宗則以十分之四交由卡車承運、路遠者亦由卡車裝運、卡車及小車兩業、爲防止紛爭及搶米事件、並曾合組豆米業運輸合作社、迄今匝月、尚稱相安無事、不爲六月六日、該台作社之糾查員在二白渡橋監視車輛運貨時、突被華捕加以毆辱、十日下午、五馬路外灘二號碼頭、車輛裝運貨物時、有糟查人四名、被捕達八小時之久、且將業經政治部核准之臂章扣留、翌日經交涉後始行發還、昨日一號碼頭駐捕、又拒絕小車拖近碼頭裝貨、並將小車二十三輛工人二十三名拘入捕房、判處罰金、全體小車工人、昨曾分向米行公會豆米行公會及政治部請示、如不獲圓滿辦法、則欲再度罷工、</p>
<p>堆棧存米調查</p>
<p>昨據上海市豆米行業同業公會報告、第一一八期存米調查自上週四起至本週四止）業已正式告竣、共計九十餘華洋米糧堆棧、總達存米一百零八萬七千八百七十七包、該項存米、僅限於各華洋堆棧、至於米號門售、居民購儲、曁各民食團體代爲訂購而已運滬者、均未調查在內、據估計、該項存米總數、亦達八十五六萬包左右、故全市國洋米糧、總共必在一百九十餘萬包以上、</p>

<h3>間接的投彈人</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>數月前美德關係尚木惡化的時候，德方為討好美人起見，特於短波無綫電廣播中，邀請美國民衆以無綫電報向德國政府發表任何意見，電報費由德方支付。不料有許多美國人竟以用這種便利，乘機把德國政府痛罵一頓，有一個在電報中希望希特勒的葬禮早日實現。可見胸中怨憤的一斑。</p>
<p>最近美國人為援助英國起見，更異想天開，組織了一種「轟炸人有限公司（Bonbardiers　Ltdel），與英國炸彈製造家有特別的聯絡。美國民衆凡有以一炸德國為快者，可以到「轟炸人有限公司裏去，任擇一種空中炸彈，付炸彈費，指定由英國皇家空軍把那顆炸彈帶到德國去投擲。英國空軍人員把所擇定的那顆炸彈投過以後，交以航空郵件寄來一張收據，向那間接的投彈人表示謝意，說明那顆炸彈業已投下，並把投彈的時間與地點指出。</p>
<p>這的確是別開生面的戰時新事業，然而這種間接的投彈人是古已有之，因為在我們的生活中，我們無形中都是間接的投彈人，有的是為光明與善良的勢力而投彈，有的却是為黑暗與醜惡的勢力而投彈。</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>科學化的殺生法</h3>
<p>— 修</p>
<p>火藥氣味不但在人間瀰漫，而且巳經延及動物界。美國的若干省中，有一種白嘴鴉擾害農村，極爲可惡。農民用通常的殺鳥方法，不能將牠們撲盡，於是從歐洲的烽火中，學得集團屠殺法。他們在那種害鳥停宿的樹中，埋置了幾枚定時炸彈，功效極佳。當那些喜歡哇哇亂叫的「暴徒」正在安眠的時候，炸彈突然爆發，一羣害鳥，化爲烏有。</p>
<p>非洲的某酋長曾向英政府商借潛水艇一艘，專爲施放水雷，撲滅鱷魚之用。他的屬境之內，鱷魚爲患，所以也要借重火藥，集團誅殺。</p>
<p>高度電爐可以殺蚊，是一種發現。這種電爐開放時，發出噏噏的聲音，傳得很述。大批蚊虫聞聲麝集，像飛蛾撲火一樣地趕到電爐上去送死。燒死的蚊虫全是雄性的，原來電爐中傳出的聲音，和雌蚊求偶的鳴聲，完令相同。美國公共衛生署鑒於這種事實，已造出一種特別殺蚊用具，式樣像無綫電收音機，嗡嗡的聲音加倍地響亮，使多情的雄蚊自投羅網。</p>
<p>某工程師徇了一個種植蔴菇的農民之請，發明一種「吸蠅風扇」。蒼蠅嗅着肥料的臭味，飛到種植蔴菇的地方，結果都被風扇吸住，走頭無路。那位發明家更在風扇上裝設「冷氣圈」使蒼蠅凍僵，紛紛跌入一隻鐵罐中。他將這種僵蠅，供給養蛙的農民，可謂善於利用廢物。</p>
<p>各種害虫中，大概以蝗虫最爲可恨，成羣的飛蝗，遮蔽天日，等到落地以後，將周圍幾英里的農產物，頃刻吃盡。有時一羣蝗虫，竟聚成寬十英里，長二十英里的一片，數目之多，豈非可驚！不幸牠們也會死於火器之下。殺蝗的火器就是從前德軍在弗蘭特斯戰塲上進攻英軍時所用的噴燄砲」。一隻輕便的圓筒，筒內裝有石蠟，安設在背後。圓筒上　着一根皮管，皮管的一端有個噴嘴。圓筒中灌滿了氣體膨脹以後，火燄便從管嘴中噴出來，可達十碼之遠。飛蝗被怒吼的火燄猛射，剩得遍地屍體。用含有砒質的甜糠殺蝗，也有很好的效騐。蝗虫吃了撒在地上的毒糠，第一天就不會像平常樣地跳躍，第二天不辨方向，全身癱瘓，第三天就一命嗚呼了。</p>
<p>有一位駕駛汽車的人，在無意中發現殺蛇妙法。他的汽車停下以後，一條毒蛇突然猛嚙車輪，可怕的利齒洞穿了汽胎，不料牠的毒牙還沒有拔出，腹中已經被輸胎中洩出的氣體灌飽，脹裂而死。</p>

<h3>一點自信</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>也許我的心靈是脆弱的，憂傷的人常常會帶着傷感而有詩意的調子說：「你是多感的人呀！」</p>
<p>不管彈奏者是一個如何拙劣的琴手，只要把手指挑動一琴弦，總會發出一點低微的琴聲，能控訴，能顯示他還有一點生命的力，能把他的感情流瀉，能把他的靈魂沉浸在中間，何往而不成爲曼妙的音樂，更何必求一般人的欣賞？</p>
<p>不一定會在我的心弦上奏出共鳴，也許我就根本不懂，（該是多麼的可憐呀！）我相信這是他所要說的話，因此他的話同樣會受我尊重。</p>
<p>雖然我蠢得可憐，但我却不預備全部予以承認，因爲我還有一點自信，自信還有一點對」的成分，我就預備在這一點自信中生存。</p>
<p>一點自信，不是拘泥頑固，也不是保守不進，在智慧者看來，自然仍不脫「可憐」，但在便有這一點自信的人，却將永遠以爲是珍寶。</p>
<p>我曾仰首向着初夏的夜空，讓凉　滲進雙肩，說不定夜半會覺到額上的灼燒，明天會帶來一個禮幷咳嗽。我還願意常常道樣做，因爲我看到了靜夜星星的閃動，領略到深邃的美麗，我也似乎懂得這個神秘</p>
<p>於是在這夜的夢中，我織起了一張靑色的憧憬，在黑暗中摸索，我得到了星光幽幽的指示。</p>
<p>據說，年輕人總脫不開一張美麗的憧憬，沒有能力加以深刻的剖析。但我想總不會是錯的，雖然沒有人能客觀地指出，那憧憬是緋色，是靑色，或金色，或是不帶有一點的。</p>
<p>沒有誰在督促，也沒有誰在逼迫，像江流奔躍，沒有什麼力量可以阻擋它的前進。</p>
<p>挫折是有的，但你相信，這反響的力量，將迸發出如何大的能力！</p>
<p>我願意撫創傷，拭淚痕，再來一個！</p>
<p>我就是有這一點自信。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的荘稼人</p>
<p>秋海棠蹙緊着雙眉，坐在一條板凳上，儘對那一盞煤油燈發呆。</p>
<p>他記得當初把這兩筆款子存進東省殖邊銀行和福華銀行去的時候，很有幾僩人勸過他，認爲這兩家銀行跟那些軍閥和政客的關係太深了，將來很容易受到影響；但那時他把袁鎭守使叔姪倆看得眞像至親一樣，聽說他們常和這兩家銀行的軍要人物來往，便終於毫不遲疑的存了進去。後來他跟湘綺談起這件事，她也覺得很不妥，可是期限沒有到，又不好意思敎紹文去替他先提出來。想不到如今果然後悔不及了！</p>
<p>「爸爸，你說過了年就送我到鎭上去念書，方才老爺子告訴我再過幾天咱們家裏又要吃灣灣順了……。爸爸，你幾時給我去買書包兒來啊？」梅寶很小心地藏好了那本照相簿坐在坑沿上，睜大了一雙很疲倦的小眼，看着她爸爸的背影問。</p>
<p>秋海棠却沒有聽見，銀行的事已使他想得出神了。</p>
<p>「爸爸，你怎麼不說話啊？」梅寶立刻扱着皮鞋，走到秋海棠的面前來，把身千伏在他的兩個膝蓋上，仰起着小腦袋，看定了她爸爸的那一張怪醜不堪的臉龐。</p>
<p>「好孩子，時候不早了，你先去睡吧！」他輕輕地把梅寶抱了起來，走向暖坑邊去。</p>
<p>梅寶一路憨憨地向他痴笑，一路自己把外衣脫下來，秋海棠就在旁邊心神不屬地看着她。</p>
<p>「乖乖地睡吧，孩子！」（一三二）</p>
<h3>空襲警報信號</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>上海人士大概都注意到，愛多　路外灘有一座又細又高的建築物，就是天文臺的信號塔。每當颶風將至之時，這塔上就掛出警告的信號，使港內的船隻，都得及時準備，避至安全地帶。</p>
<p>近來德國也利用此類的設備，以補空襲警報之不足。在城市裏，報告空襲的笛聲是誰都可以聽到的，但是在郊外的人就沒有辦法聽到，於是他們就在公路上添油站的附近，設立空襲警報桿，使添油站的職員接到警報時，能把空襲警報的信號掛上。公路上汽車中的人，看到這種黃色與藍色的信號，就可以一目瞭然，知道有空襲。</p>

<h3>東方話劇的革新</h3>
<p>— 茜蒂</p>
<p>東九話劇塲自今日（十四）起，已與華夏劇社携起手米，共同以通俗化形式，表演新型之話劇。這一次大的變動，新的改革，無疑地是說叫了劇運前途的光明，自然，我們是很歡迎那批有大才有經騐的文明戲演員，慢慢地同話劇相接近，同時我們也是極願意那些有潛勢力的文明戲觀衆，漸漸地對話劇以認識，一方是演員的本身鍛練，一面是觀衆的水準提高，那消息，使任何人聽釗以後，都會覺得非常高興的。</p>
<p>東方一向是徘徊在文明戲與話劇之間。六年來，在劇務部主任關鍵的策劉之下，已經演過有二百多個劇本，幕表凡八百餘，這中間，大部是一些迎合普通階級觀衆的悲喜劇，像解語花，紅杏出牆記，春風回夢記等，都很能叫座，然而嚴格地說，他們離開話劇的水準，很遠很落後的，所以這一决大的變動，新的改革，是整個話劇界的喜訊。</p>
<p>在改革之初，他們還是一種冒險的嘗試。爲了使推進這運動的積極性，並且又要顧到環境上的種種阻礙，他們決定邀請電影界，戲劇界大批的導演及演員參加，劇作家劇評人如黃魯，毛羽，江流等，也都分任編導工作，至於舊有的優秀演員如宋小天，宣棲梧，武太虛，但賽文等，仍予保留合作。</p>
<p>現在已擬定的劇目，共十個：</p>
<p>（一）理想夫人，（二）情仇，（三）新婚燕爾，（四）假仁假義，（五）衆香閣，（六）人慾橫流，（七）人生大事，（八）在歡之夜，（九）搖錢樹，（十）夜半歌聲。</p>
<p>這一個劇本，每隔五天換一個。預備是在五十天內演完</p>
<p>關於此决嘗試的成績如何，當還待於他們本身的努力與社會各界的協力的幫助。記者也虔誠地希望東方的戲工作人員，果能如此埋頭苦幹，不畏難，不退縮，永遠記住自己肩上所負的使命。</p>

<h3>Joint Declaration of the Allied Governments: Fighting Aggression to the End, Willing to Help Each Other Strive for Final Victory, No Peace Under Violent Oppression</h3>
<p>London – The Allied governments held a general meeting yesterday at St. James's Palace here to discuss the overall war situation. After representatives of the various governments spoke in succession, a resolution was passed expressing the Allies' united and firm determination to continue the war. The text of the resolution reads: "The governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa , Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Greece , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Yugoslavia , and the representative of General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces participating in the war, resolve as follows: (1) They will continue to fight against German and Italian aggression until victory is achieved. They will assist each other in their struggles to the best of their ability. (2) There can be no lasting peace and prosperity for free peoples held by force and compelled to submit to the dominion of Germany or its allies, or for free peoples living under such threats. (3) The only true foundation for durable peace is the voluntary cooperation of free peoples in a world free from the threat of aggression, where everyone enjoys economic and social security. Those present are willing to work together, both in war and peace, with each other and with other free peoples to achieve this goal."</p>
<p>Churchill's Speech</p>
<p>The original text of British Prime Minister Churchill's speech is as follows: "In the twenty-second month of the war against Nazism, we gather at St. James's Palace to proclaim the noble aspirations of the legitimate governments of the ravaged nations of Europe and to inspire hope in the free peoples of the world. Before us are the credentials of ten countries whose lands have been invaded and whose peoples are enslaved. Representatives of the British overseas dominions of Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , and territories such as India and Burma are also gathered here. They have all drawn their swords for a cause and will not rest until their last breath or until victory is won. As we gather here, the sound of uninterrupted work from American factories across the Atlantic encourages us, informing us of the coming of swift and ever-increasing assistance. The suffering, terror, and evil that Hitler has inflicted on Europe and the world are beyond description. The destruction of Warsaw, Rotterdam, and Belgrade are unforgettable monuments for future generations, constantly reminding people of the outrage of scientific cruelty inflicted on helpless civilians by aerial bombardment. But this is only the visible damage on the surface.</p>
<h3>Enslaving Other Races and Creating Puppets: The Axis's Sins Are Too Numerous to Count</h3>
<p>What is particularly heinous is the suffering of the conquered peoples, who are not only bound and intimidated but also abused. Millions of strong men are forced to work in conditions little different from slavery. All their possessions are seized or exchanged for worthless currency. Their families and daily lives are constantly spied on by omnipresent secret political police. These police not only keep the Germans themselves in abject submission but are now spread throughout the streets and alleys of more than ten countries. Religious beliefs are suppressed and destroyed to promote the fallacy of atheism and to make people worship the autocracy of one man. The good customs, culture, laws, and social and governmental institutions of the conquered peoples are either destroyed by violence or undermined by insidious conspiracies. The prisons on the continent are not sufficient to hold the prisoners, and the concentration camps are overcrowded. Every dawn, the sound of gunfire is heard. Good people in the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, Yugoslavia, Greece, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France have made countless sacrifices for their beliefs and their countries. The "Quislings," despicable traitors whom mankind will forever despise, are hired as the claws and teeth of the conquerors, harming their compatriots even as they themselves groan under the oppression. All this that I’m saying is a description of what glorious and brilliant Europe has become today, and it is against that reality that we stand up and resist."</p>
<h3>Fundamental Reconstruction of European Order: Not to Be Entrusted to Hitler</h3>
<p>"Gentlemen, this is the foundation upon which Hitler, with Mussolini following behind him and Darlan attending at his side, seeks to build a "New Order in Europe" from hatred and greed. It is utterly absurd. We cannot say how the war will spread or what direction it will take. We know that it will be arduous and that it will last a long time. We also cannot predict its development. However, one thing is certain, undeniable, and recognized by the whole world: the reconstruction of Europe or the unification of European countries will never come from the hands of the Germans. Any country that has been invaded by German soldiers and police hates the name of the Germans and despises Nazism. This sentiment cannot be erased even after hundreds of years. We do not yet know how or when liberation will come, but what is most certain is that Hitler's footprints and fingerprints will be swept away completely and, if necessary, eradicated from the face of the earth. Gentlemen, we reiterate here our unity in relentless effort, seeking to liberate the fettered nations. A year ago, the British government alone faced the raging storm. At that time, both our enemies and our friends seemed to think that our days were numbered and that Britain and its institutions would be forever lost.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Not Easily Lay Down Its Arms Until War Goals Are Achieved</h3>
<p>But I can proudly tell you that, even though last year the army was ill-equipped, there was hardly a cannon or a tank in the country, and almost all our military supplies and ammunition were lost in the dark days of France, we never despaired for a moment of the common cause. We not only did not despair but also declared to the world at that time our determination not to make peace until all the enslaved countries were liberated and Nazi domination was completely crushed. Gentlemen, look at how we have progressed since the emergency period of last June. Our strength and resilience have undergone a terrible test. We are now masters of our own skies and are launching increasingly heavy blows against the enemy. Our navy has regained control of the seas. The American fleet is hiding in harbors, its power diminishing daily, and the German navy has also been largely destroyed. The brutal air raids that the enemy has inflicted on our ports, cities, and factories have ultimately failed to break the spirit of our people, extinguish the life of our nation, or halt the expansion of our war industry. Food and munitions are now safely transported overseas. Replacements for sunken ships are being actively built in the country, and our American friends are helping us even more during this period.</p>
<h3>The British Isles Are Heavily Fortified: Any Nazi Invasion Will Meet with Misfortune</h3>
<p>We are now gradually becoming an armed society. The land forces are perfecting their equipment and training. Although Hitler can roam across Europe and spread his fierce flames, although he can invade Africa or covet Asia, the decisive battle will ultimately be fought on this heavily fortified island of Britain. We are determined to meet him on land and sea. Wherever Hitler goes, we will follow in his footsteps to strike him. Our air force will continue to make the German people fully understand that war is not just about plunder and victory. We will encourage and assist the resistance of the people in the occupied countries. We will thwart Hitler's every effort to consolidate his gains. Hitler will have no peace, no rest, and no negotiations to be had. If Hitler tries to invade the British Isles in desperation, we are determined to meet him with the greatest test. With the help of God, we will remain steadfast in our faith and tireless in our duty until the work is completed. Gentlemen, what I say today to all countries of the world, to all freedom-loving peoples, to the allies of Europe, and to our friends in America is: "Rise up your hearts, the result is good, and the glory of mankind will be born out of suffering and sacrifice".

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Broadcasts to South America: Asks for Assistance in the Fight for Freedom</h3>
<p>London – Early this morning, Foreign Secretary Eden made a broadcast speech to Latin America, saying that no matter how long, how difficult, how fierce, or how hindered the war may be, final victory will be ours. No one in our country doubts this; it is certain and will be decisive. British soldiers, sailors, and airmen are superior to German and Italian enemy soldiers; this has been proven. From July to November of last year, during the great battle of Britain, the Royal Air Force defeated the German planes despite their overwhelming numerical advantage; this is just one example that can be cited. Britain and other major cities may not be spared from continuous blitzkrieg attacks, but the people are not alarmed by them. On the contrary, they are uplifted by these unprecedented disasters. Planes can destroy the buildings of our nation, but bombs cannot break the spirit of our people. The great and generous assistance we are now receiving from the United States ensures the victory of the Allied forces.</p>

<p>In his address to Congress in January of this year, President Roosevelt stated that he hoped the world in the future would be based on four freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Our struggle today with the Allied forces can make this noble concept of a better life a success. This is not a war of nations; it is a war of faith and standards of life. Sooner or later, everyone must decide which side to stand on, whether it be on the side of light or darkness. Eden's speech was specifically addressed to Britons residing in Latin America and thanked them for their contributions to the Empire's war effort. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Feels Threatened: Actively Strengthening Military and Armaments: Rumors of Nazi Troops Concentrating on Border, Attempting to Force Soviet Union to Allow Passage to Attack Near East</h3>
<p>Ankara – According to well-informed Turkish sources, the important result of Stalin's personal assumption of the post of People's Commissar is the intensification of the Soviet Union's military build-up, with particular emphasis on the expansion and modernization of the air force. At the same time, speakers in some military units are now telling soldiers and workers that it is extremely important for the Red Army to be strong enough to avoid or repel any German attack if necessary. These speakers warned their audiences that Germany was an enemy of the Soviet Union before Molotov's visit to Germany last November. After Molotov returned, the Soviet government cancelled this campaign, but it was resumed in January of this year and has become increasingly intense ever since. Turkish sources here all believe that the main thrust of Soviet foreign policy is fear of Germany. The Germans are well aware of this situation and, backed by a large number of Romanian troops in Moldavia, will probably soon make further economic demands on the Soviet government. Sources here believe that Stalin will accept the German demands because his policy is to buy time so that he can build a great army and industrial infrastructure to support that army in wartime. The same sources also believe that Stalin will resist if Hitler attempts to invade Ukraine. The Soviet government will reject any concessions that would undermine the Soviet Union, such as German control of certain railways and industries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London – Foreign Secretary Eden met with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps yesterday. At the same time, reports have resurfaced that Germany will threaten the Soviet Union militarily. A foreign embassy here reports that 75 German divisions have concentrated on the German-Soviet border in Soviet-occupied Poland, and 25 German divisions have moved to the Romanian-Soviet border. It is also reported that 20 to 25 Romanian divisions have been mobilized and are preparing for war. The report states that the Soviet Union is currently rushing to build fortifications in Bessarabia and that Soviet troops are also destroying roads near the border. Soviet sources admit that it may be true that large numbers of troops are stationed on the border, but say that Germany will not attack the Soviet Union or intimidate the Soviet government into yielding to Germany in negotiations. Turkish sources say that Hitler has asked the Soviet Union for facilities at the Black Sea ports so that Germany can advance directly to the Caucasus from Romania without going through Ukraine. German troops could then invade Iran and Iraq through the Caucasus and threaten the entire British right flank in the Near East. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>German-Romanian Talks: Contents Kept Secret: Romanian Prime Minister Returns Home from Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin – A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declined to reveal the contents of the talks now being conducted in Germany by Romanian State Leader Antonescu, saying only that the talks were still in progress. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Vienna – Romanian State Leader Antonescu, who has been meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich for several days, returned here by plane yesterday afternoon, accompanied by German Minister to Romania Killingen. Romanian Minister of Economy, Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force, German Minister-Counselor Neubacher, and German Generals Spittel and Hauf were at the airport to welcome them.

<h3>Public Concession Tram Fares Increase Again</h3>
<p>After the passage and implementation of the price increases for water, electricity, and gas, it was known that related public enterprises would inevitably follow suit with their own price increases, especially in the electricity sector, where the impact is even greater. The increase would affect the entire sector; this was inevitable. Now, the increase in tram fares in the Public Concession has been approved. The most important reason for the fare increase is that the company's revenue has failed to keep up with the increase in expenditures, and the most significant part of the increase in expenditures is the cost of electricity, which has increased more than fourfold. Although there are also so-called reasons such as the impact of the current situation on the slight depreciation of exchange rates, these are only for show! The main reason is still the cost of electricity. Now that the matter has been approved, it is almost a foregone conclusion, and there is no point in arguing about it afterwards. However, in view of the fact that public utilities are repeatedly increasing their prices, who knows if others won’t follow the trams with their own price increases, or use the excuse of public utility price increases to also increase their prices? Although the cause of this may be small, the result will be great. Standing on the platform of public welfare, one knows that it is impossible to reason with them, and there is no point in speaking, but one cannot but say something!</p>
<p>Public utilities cannot use the general surge in prices as a reason for increasing prices, because the general surge in prices is precisely due to private enterprises that only know how to seek profit and do not care about the overall situation. Although public utilities are also private enterprises, they are given the right of exclusive franchise. They are given ample protection in normal times, and they should plan ahead in emergencies. For example, the price of coal sold to power companies is certainly lower than the market price, not only because they have a large sales volume, but also because the coal sold in the market may not be immediately consumed after being transferred and circulated. However, this is not the case with coal sold to power companies. Furthermore, although other factories also have a need for coal, they do not have the scale of power companies and have to seek it on the market. Power companies, on the other hand, consume a large amount of coal every day, and the companies that supply coal must be large in scale and fully equipped. The shipment of coal should not be affected by the high freight rates of merchant ships. Therefore, although the market price of coal has risen sharply, the price of coal for power companies must be very different. Otherwise, it must be due to their negligence in the necessary attention to their business. Therefore, if power companies use the rise in prices and compare it with rice and coal on the market as a reason for increasing prices, it is not only inappropriate but also unconvincing. Now that the tram company's price increase is following the power company's lead, it seems to be justifiable. However, the reasonableness of things cannot be sought from the text. Reports on paper must be carefully considered before they are issued, and there is definitely no reason why they should not be reasonable. The tram company claims that its net profit has fallen sharply from 8.5% in 1936 to only 1.3% last year, so in order to maintain its due profit, it must resort to increasing tram fares to make up for the loss. This is indeed a matter of course. However, judging from the surface of the tram company's business, although expenses have increased, the congestion of passengers is several times greater than before the war. Regardless of the actual number of passengers, even if we count the number of tickets sold by the tram company, it must have increased year by year, breaking historical records. This can undoubtedly offset most of the increase in expenses. In the minds of Chinese people, there has always been a feeling that Eastern and Western cultures, thoughts, spirits, and abilities each have their strengths and weaknesses, but the service spirit and management skills of Westerners are superior, and the Chinese people of the East are indeed lacking in their strict regulation. However, one cannot hastily praise the tram company's driving management, because passengers are often crushed to death under the tram, suffer physical injuries, and face unexpected dangers. The newspapers are full of such reports. Moreover, trams often fail to stop at designated stations and speed past, ignoring the signals. They also start driving before passengers have finished getting on and off, and misfortune strikes. All of this cannot be blamed on the passengers' own carelessness but should be the responsibility of the tram company. As for buying tickets and not receiving tickets, and even being insulted when asking for them, the newspapers have discussed this extensively before the tram company decided to increase fares, but the tram company has turned a blind eye and deaf ear to it, and there is still no sign of improvement. It is regrettable! In the tram business in Shanghai, the spirit of selling tickets and giving tickets even when passengers have arrived at their stops and alighted without asking for them was only seen in the former Nanshi Chinese Tram Company. Now, instead of plugging the leaks that should be plugged and making the necessary rectifications, the tram company is only increasing the burden on the public to make up for the losses. It is expected that the higher the fares, the more coveted the revenue will be, and the deeper the abuses will become. The leaks will also become larger and larger, and it is feared that the gains will still be insufficient to maintain the net profit they should enjoy. Will they then resort to increasing prices again? This would only increase the burden on the public and would not help improve their business. Is this the original intention of allowing public utilities to monopolize? Therefore, from the standpoint of the public, the Public Concession Tram has no reason to increase prices at the moment that can gain public understanding.</p>
<p>As for the Municipal Council, it only based its decision on the Public Utilities Committee's request, believing that it was in accordance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and should be approved. It did not consider whether it was in line with public sentiment or whether it would increase the heavy burden on the general public! Has the tram company made its best efforts to do its best in terms of revenue and expenditure, and are there any other ways to make up for the losses besides increasing prices? Also, compared with the same business in the same area, is there a significant difference, or is there a difference in the quality of the business and the fees charged? If the Municipal Council could consider and deliberate on all of these matters in detail, and make efforts to rectify all aspects of driving management so that passengers would not face unexpected dangers or inconvenience in riding, and then approve the tram's due price increase, the people would not only have no objections but would also applaud and celebrate that the Municipal Council was truly able to know that public opinion is important and that welfare is in mind.</p>

<h3>Robin Moore Sunk by Germany; US to Issue Strong Protest; Demanding German Compensation and Apology; Nation to React Strongly to This</h3>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources believe that the US government is likely to issue a stern warning to Germany, tantamount to a declaration of war, demanding compensation and an apology for the sinking of the Robin Moore. Whether this incident will lead to a severance of diplomatic ties between the US and Germany depends on whether Washington and Berlin can agree on the facts of the ship's misfortune and who is responsible. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that thirty-five crew members and passengers are still missing. Berlin has made no comment on the matter, stating only that Germany is conducting a full investigation. As for what plan President Roosevelt will adopt, it can only be decided after he receives the report from US Vice Consul Williamson, who is personally questioning the surviving crew members in Pernambuco, Brazil. Williamson is scheduled to fly to Washington from Pernambuco today. Part of his report has already been sent to Washington by US Consul Lincoln in Pernambuco. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the sinking of the American freighter Robin Moore, the United States seems poised to take strong diplomatic action against Germany, perhaps even more forceful measures. Various quarters in Washington are reacting strongly to the incident. Some hardliners suggest, "Escort with a battleship fleet, and open fire if necessary." Moderates, on the other hand, express doubt as to whether Germany is responsible for the loss of the Robin Moore. In any case, Washington is deeply concerned about the matter, and newspapers have already begun citing the earlier incident of the sinking of the Lusitania, which led the United States to enter World War I. The chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee stated, "We should escort with a battleship fleet and allow them to open fire. Let's see who shoots first and who can defeat the other." Democratic Senator Connally said, "The sinking of the Robin Moore was an unprovoked attack. The US government will take appropriate measures to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from recurring." Republican Senator McNary stated, "I believe the matter depends on where the ship sank. If it sank in dangerous waters, or in a war zone, or near a war zone, then we should not be overly agitated. But if it sank in peaceful waters, then the situation is very serious." Republican Senator Johnson said, "I hope this is not an unfortunate incident that they (the interventionists) are seeking." Isolationist Senator Wheeler said, "I hope this is not one of the unfortunate incidents that the advocates of intervention claim the President is seeking to bring us into the war. The United States is not prepared for war, and the people do not want to go to war." Democratic Senator Ellison said that he does not believe the State Department knows for certain that the Robin Moore was sunk by a German submarine. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German informed circles stated yesterday that the Berlin military had not received any reports proving that the American freighter "Robin Moore" sank in the South Atlantic due to the actions of a German submarine. They stated that the matter is currently under investigation, but they strongly doubt that a German submarine could have done this, because "if so, the military here should have received a report by now." Since the "Robin Moore" incident occurred, German newspapers and radio stations have made no mention of it whatsoever. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - Assistant Secretary of State Welles announced yesterday, "There is no doubt that the American freighter Robin Moore was sunk by a German submarine, and the submarine commander knew full well that the Robin Moore was an American ship." It is expected that this announcement will cause a serious reaction in the United States. Welles, when addressing reporters yesterday, appeared grave and stated that according to a report from US Consul Lincoln in Pernambuco, Brazil, the Robin Moore was undoubtedly sunk by a German submarine. Welles also officially read a summary of the report prepared by the US Consul based on the accounts of eleven surviving crew members of the Robin Moore, stating, "The Robin Moore sank at 6:00 AM (Greenwich Mean Time) on May 21st, at 6 degrees 10 minutes North latitude and 25 degrees 40 minutes West longitude. The submarine commander knew the ship was American. The survivors are all in good health. Their statements have been recorded. A summary will be sent after it is translated into code. Thirty-five crew members are missing." Welles also stated that the Robin Moore was not carrying war materiel or other military supplies that violated neutrality laws. The cargo consisted of a wide variety of goods, from steel rails to women's socks, as well as various items such as automobiles and automobile parts, intended for shipment to Lourenço Marques, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, and East London in Africa. He had not received detailed reports and was therefore unable to comment further. When asked if the US government viewed the incident seriously, Welles declined to answer. President Roosevelt's Secretary, Early, stated that it seemed there was no longer reason to reserve judgment and that news could be expected on Monday, or perhaps a little later, as officials here needed to study the matter before deciding what action to take. Cautious observers here expect that the official announcement that the Robin Moore was deliberately sunk by a German submarine will spark a national reaction. The US government's seriousness regarding this matter can be seen in Welles' words. Many people have the impression that Welles' words may be the first step in preparing for a major development. Although few believe that the Robin Moore incident will directly lead the United States into the war, there is no doubt that it could take the steps to prepare the American people's hearts and minds for war, as it has brought the war to America's doorstep.

<h3>Admiral Yarnell Declares: US Must Fight Germany and Japan Simultaneously; America's Border Is in Asia; Should Take Offensive Action Quickly</h3>
<p>Washington - Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, recently wrote an article in the Washington Post stating that if Britain is not defeated, the strength of the US Navy will be sufficient to fight in both oceans, but it must not remain on the defensive. Events in Europe are moving rapidly, and active US participation in the war is only a matter of time. Japan's alliance with Berlin disregards American hopes, and the war will spread to the Far East. If Japan can successfully invade the Dutch East Indies, then the white race in the Far East is finished. Therefore, Singapore is as militarily important to the US as it is to Britain. The fact that we must accept is that if we fight Germany (which we will and should), we must also fight Japan. The sooner we understand this and are prepared, the better it will be for us. Yarnell then described the factors favorable to the United States, such as utilizing the ports of Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as the British and Dutch East Indies' naval, land, and air bases. He continued that China is currently holding back a million Japanese soldiers and can intensify its fighting if supplied. The Japanese base on Taiwan is easy to bomb. Japan's maritime trade will come to an end, and Japan must fight two or three thousand miles from its home base. He argues that the United States should quickly utilize the basic principle of military victory, namely, taking the initiative and the offensive. The current US fleet is stronger than the US fleet would be in 1946 if Germany and Japan succeed in Europe and Asia. But the US fleet must fight on the border and in accordance with the principles of naval warfare. If the United States seeks victory, it cannot leave its fleet on its home waters but must take swift and decisive offensive action on the border. The American border in the Pacific is in Southeast Asia. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>US President Considering Oil Embargo on Japan</h3>
<p>New York - According to the New York Herald Tribune, close to government sources, the United States is currently considering whether to halt oil shipments to Japan. If President Roosevelt takes this action, the proposed restrictions on the use of gasoline and fuel throughout New York and the East Coast could be eased, and shortages of fuel oil for heating homes, offices, and factories could be prevented, thus preventing the rise in gasoline prices. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>Resolving the East Coast Oil Shortage</h3>
<p>Washington - Interior Secretary Ickes told reporters yesterday that oil restrictions in the eastern United States seem unavoidable. He hopes to have a plan for civilian oil conservation within one or two weeks. He has asked the Shipping Board to inform him of the availability of American oil tankers flying foreign flags and whether they can be requisitioned to alleviate the East Coast oil shortage. According to oil industry sources, Ickes' plan aims to prevent an oil shortage this winter and to allow oil shipments to Japan. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan Reports British and American Diplomatic Pressure on Thailand and Vietnam; Ban on Kerosene and Goods to Japan; Aizawa Criticizes Dutch East Indies for Ignoring New Order</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reports from Hanoi today that Britain and the United States are taking advantage of the stalled Batavia talks to conduct joint activities in Vietnam and Thailand to increase their economic blockade against Japan. The report claims that the United States is pressuring the Dutch East Indies in an attempt to ban kerosene exports to Japan. At the same time, Britain is currently putting pressure on Thailand to supply all goods intended for Japan to Britain. The newspaper states that British and American "business circles" are reportedly cooperating with Chinese merchants to prevent exports from Thailand and Vietnam to Japan. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reports that rice shipments from Saigon to Japan have recently been blocked, and the Vietnamese authorities have even proposed cutting off half of the rice exports for June, July, and August. The newspaper also carries a special dispatch from Bangkok stating that Britain is using kerosene supplies as bait to curb the production of rubber and tin in Thailand in order to prevent these raw materials from falling into the hands of Japan and other Axis powers. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Aizawa, the head of the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies trade talks, stated yesterday that the argument made by Dutch East Indies officials, that they fear Japan would re-export Dutch East Indies goods to Germany, is an excuse for East Asian nations' unwillingness to cooperate. Aizawa strongly asserted that the Dutch East Indies is attempting to not recognize the "New Order in East Asia," which is the real reason for the breakdown of the Japanese-Dutch East Indies trade talks. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii officially told reporters today that experts are currently drafting instructions to Aizawa in accordance with the policy towards the Dutch East Indies decided by the government on the 11th of this month. The government meeting on that day not only considered the attitude of the Dutch East Indies towards Japan but also took into account the international situation. After Aizawa receives these instructions, the content of the instructions will be released, along with a government statement. When asked if this meant Aizawa would be recalled before the final instructions were issued, the spokesman did not answer. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It was learned today that Aizawa, the Japanese representative in Batavia, stated in a wireless telephone conversation with the Yomiuri Shimbun that because the Dutch East Indies authorities are currently taking a tough stance and their reply is final, there is no room for compromise. Although certain points have improved after clarification, it is not enough to allow the talks to turn around. The reply from the Dutch East Indies authorities was decided after careful study by the Dutch East Indies Parliament, and there is no need to take any further steps. Therefore, there is no need to meet with the Dutch East Indies authorities again before he departs for home on the 29th of this month. The people and newspapers of the Dutch East Indies are now strongly supporting the government's tough stance, so he believes the situation will gradually become more difficult. Aizawa discounted the news of the evacuation of Japanese residents, saying that Japanese residents are not preparing for a total evacuation. The Japanese Consul-General in Batavia is currently urging Japanese residents to remain calm. Aizawa also said that the fundamental reason for the failure of the talks is that the Dutch East Indies authorities do not understand the global situation and the order that is currently changing in East Asia. The current situation is one that Japan cannot ignore or allow to continue to exist. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>US Believes Japan-Soviet Pact Has No Important Value; Japanese Aim Only to Deceive the Public</h3>
<p>Washington - Commerce officials believed yesterday that the newly agreed-upon trade treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan was designed to offset the failure of the trade negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands. Experts doubt whether the Soviet Union and Japan have any military necessities to exchange in large quantities. Only oil comes to mind, or perhaps the Soviet Union could ship oil from Sakhalin Island to Japan. However, the amount of oil that the Soviet Union can supply to Japan is very small compared to Japan's peacetime needs. Therefore, it is believed that the Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations are merely a symbolic formality to satisfy the Japanese public's demands after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact. Experts also said that Soviet manganese ore is produced in the Caucasus, which is too far from Japan, and the transportation costs are extremely high. Soviet fertilizer production areas are 3,000 to 6,000 miles away from Japan, making transportation inconvenient. The production of platinum is also not significant. As for what Japan can supply, it is a large amount of silk, which is of little use to the Soviet Union except for making parachutes. Japan lacks machinery and is unlikely to supply the Soviet Union with important machinery. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Japanese side yesterday expressed satisfaction with the Soviet-Japanese trade agreement. They stated that the formal agreement is not far from being finalized and that both countries are currently proceeding in a spirit of "mutual concessions." Soviet newspapers commented on the matter, saying that a foundation has been laid for resolving important outstanding issues between the two countries. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>US President Appoints Chief Justice</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday appointed Stone as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and appointed Burns and Attorney General Robert as deputies. (International News, 13th)</p>
<h3>Gayda Issues Warning to the United States</h3>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece Gayda wrote an article in the Italian Daily yesterday stating that US participation in the war would have two major consequences: one, to prolong the resistance of England; and two, to prompt Japan to intervene. Gayda said, "US intervention in the war would only prolong the war, because at that time the US fleet would be at the disposal of England in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and increase destruction. At that time, Japan will also participate in the war. Although the Axis powers have never intended to attack the United States, if Washington voluntarily participates in the war, then the Axis powers will have to react." (United Press, 13th)</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Rapidly Advance in Syria; Three Major Cities Heavily Encircled; Damascus and Beirut on the Verge of Falling; Rumor Says Vichy Officials Fleeing North in Panic</h3>
<p>London - According to the latest official news from Syria, the Allied forces continue to make significant progress and are now surrounding Syria's three major cities: Damascus, Beirut, and Aleppo. The British Air Force continues to assist the army in its advance and has bombed aircraft at the German-controlled Aleppo airfield. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - According to sources here, Free French forces have entered Kiswe. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Cairo - The Allied forces in Syria are continuing to advance while avoiding battle as much as possible, and have reached the outskirts of the ancient city of Sidon and the southern outskirts of Damascus, ten miles from the city. The main area of French resistance is along the coastal Litani River crossing and north of Matrai, blocking the central Allied forces advancing towards Damascus. After being bombarded by rifles and long-range artillery, the French forces have been defeated, and half of those who surrendered expressed sympathy with the Allied forces. Although the Allied forces have now reached the area where the French forces under General Dentz, the French High Commissioner, are concentrated, it is said here that the Vichy communiqué's claim of "fierce fighting" is a gross exaggeration. Cairo believes that Vichy may be deliberately issuing exaggerated news to prepare for surrender. There has been no news of Free French forces clashing with French forces in Syria. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - According to the latest news received here, the Allied forces in Syria are making satisfactory progress. There has been no confirmation here of reports that they have reached the outskirts of Damascus. Free French forces are currently conducting flanking maneuvers ten miles south of Damascus. British forces have occupied two villages in the area, and in the center of the area, they have crossed Moqaso, the fall of which was confirmed yesterday. Moqaso was the headquarters of the Syrian border outposts and was captured by British and imperial forces without firing a shot. The resistance comes purely from Vichy forces. The main French forces have retreated north, leaving only isolated pockets of resistance in the mountains behind Kuneitra. For the past three days, British forces have tried to avoid bloodshed, repeatedly sending envoys with white flags to the French forces to demand surrender. When the requests for peace were unsuccessful, they launched an attack, and within a few hours, three important strongholds guarding the route to Beirut were captured by British forces. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - Sources here say that Free French forces, supported by mechanized units and the British Royal Army, reached the outskirts of Damascus this morning. It is also said that the Allied forces are now only a fifteen-minute bus ride from the center of the city. Another report says that Vichy officials in Damascus have fled to Aleppo, forming a long line of motor vehicles and special trains carrying them north. People have been expecting the Allied forces to enter Damascus for three days, and now this expectation is becoming a certainty. It is expected that the Allied forces will enter the city peacefully, without resistance. This belief is based on reports from Cairo that the Allied forces have made a proposal to French and American officials in Syria, including Dentz, ordering them not to resist when the Allied forces enter, so as to preserve this historic city from damage. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>London - It is learned that one unit advancing along the coast is on the outskirts of Sidon and is heading towards Beirut, while another report says that fighting is raging in the vast orange groves, apricot orchards, banana plantations, and lemon groves surrounding Sidon. According to various special sources, the Allied forces are now engaged in a fierce battle after advancing west from the Litani River towards Sidon, but are being cut into several sections by French troops hiding in caves, forests, and rocks. This situation was eventually overcome through hand-to-hand combat, and progress then continued. However, some troops must apparently bypass Sidon, which is twenty miles from Beirut, and advance. As for the unit that occupied Moqaso, it subsequently reached Hasbaya and is now reportedly attacking Damascus from the east. The forces reaching the outskirts of Damascus may be waiting for other troops to arrive before entering the city. There is no fresh news regarding the two units attacking Syria from Iraq. Today, people here, after learning that Vichy admitted that Dentz's forces had abandoned their main defensive position at Moqaso, which they had been using to resist the British forces, expect the French resistance in southern Syria to collapse soon. It is believed that the unit occupying Moqaso must be attacking Rayak to the north or Damascus to the northeast. It is believed here that the naval aircraft's reconnaissance attack on Beirut is sufficient to indicate that the unit advancing along the coastal highway must be continuing to advance and may quickly occupy Beirut. Unofficial sources say that British troops have entered deep into the outskirts of Sidon, and the French forces in Kiswe are still stubbornly resisting the Allied forces, while Free French forces are trying to capture Damascus from the south. This unit is reportedly still engaged in fierce fighting with the defenders. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>London - The official French news agency claimed yesterday afternoon that the Australian forces advancing on the city of Sidon in Syria have not yet been able to break through the French resistance, and the fighting is fierce. British warships are constantly bombarding the coast. French forces are defending their positions in the orange groves around Sidon. The Australian attack is supported by tanks and heavy artillery from the fleet. The fleet, consisting of one battleship, two cruisers, and five destroyers, has been bombing the port for three days. French destroyers engaged in battle, and their shells hit two British light cruisers. Fighting continues behind Moqaso. French forces withdrew from Moqaso on Wednesday and are defending strong positions five or six miles behind the city. The Tegor troops in front of Damascus, the Syrian capital, attacked Jisso, fifteen miles south of Damascus, yesterday, but according to the latest news, the attack by the Tegor troops has been repulsed. London believes that the Vichy's news of fierce fighting may be deliberately spread to promote the French-German plan to eliminate French sympathy for England. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Government Responds to Vichy Protest; Declares No Territorial Ambitions in Syria; Vichy Lodges Second Protest Yesterday</h3>
<p>London - According to Vichy's protest note to Britain, the current situation makes it difficult to explain Britain's attack on Syria, which may have the most serious consequences. Pending further information, France wishes to avoid taking actions that could escalate the conflict. If the dispute unfortunately escalates, France will be forced to take necessary measures to defend its territory. The protest note repeatedly stated that France has not cooperated with Germany in Syria. In its response to France, Britain refused to dispute the definition of the word "cooperation," stating that the British military's actions are based on the facts of the Syrian situation, not on theoretical concepts. Britain is pleased with Marshal Pétain's assurance of avoiding the spread of conflict. It would be for the benefit of both countries if the Vichy government could order French forces to cease resisting the Allied forces and prevent the Germans from using Syria as a base against the Allied forces. The reply reiterates that Britain has no territorial ambitions in Syria or other French colonies and states that Britain aims to achieve victory in order to restore France's independence and greatness. According to a statement from the British Foreign Office, the Vichy government's note was delivered by the Vichy ambassador in Madrid to British Ambassador to Spain Sir Hoare on June 8th. The French ambassador also informed the British ambassador of the contents of the note from Vichy diplomat Darlan to the American ambassador in Vichy on behalf of his government. In its response to the Vichy protest, Britain stated that the Pétain government should be held responsible for the Syrian French authorities' obedience to help Britain's enemies and that French bloodshed is not Britain's wish. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Marshal Pétain was still trying to make peace with England last night to end the conflict in Syria and hinted that if England wanted to occupy this French mandated territory, France would cooperate more closely with Germany. The French government sent a note to the French ambassador in Madrid, Biatteley, to deliver to the British ambassador to Spain, Hoare, offering Syria peace and wanting England to acknowledge the error of accusing France of allowing Germany to occupy Syria, followed by an immediate withdrawal of troops. The note was the first communication from France since the Syrian war, and although officials hinted that this second French protest was more peaceful, the United Press knows that the tone of the note was harder than the first. The note reiterated that there were no German troops in Syria, and it strongly stated that now that England had been able to prove that there were no German troops in Syria, there was no reason to continue the war. The conclusion was a combination of the meaning of the previous two notes, stating that if the British army invaded after proving that their claim that the German army had occupied Syria was wrong, the only result would be to strengthen France's determination to cooperate with Germany in Europe.

<h3>Guangzhouwan Bans Sale of Daguang Bao; Authorities to Protest</h3>

Unexpectedly, it incurred the jealousy of Japanese agents, who demanded that the Guangzhouwan government ban its distribution and sale in the leased territory. The French authorities granted their request, banning the newspaper's entry on June 1st.

<h3>A Visit to the Ma Family Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The Yongjia Ma Family's Exhibition of Epigraphy, Calligraphy and Painting was held at the Daxin Painting Hall from the 11th to the 15th, attracting a huge crowd and reaching a peak. The late Mr. Ma Mengrong was proficient in the Six Principles and excelled at flowers, birds, insects and fish, with ingenious workmanship. He lectured at the Art College during his lifetime and had many students. Mr. Gongyu's calligraphy, painting and epigraphy are known as the Five Wonders and have enjoyed a great reputation for a long time. His cousin Bixuan, younger brother Shiling, and niece Jingjuan are either good at figures, landscapes, or flowers. The family's academic achievements are rare. I visited yesterday and was immersed in the forest of masterpieces, spending several hours in study. I had a feeling of being so engrossed that I forgot about eating meat for three days. Among them, Mr. Mengrong's posthumous works are mostly wonderful pieces. The flowers and birds are most notably "Exotic Flowers," "Trumpet Creeper," and "Sunflower." The colors are bright and dazzling, and the brushwork is strong and elegant. It is truly indescribable with paper and ink. The inscriptions are also very elegant. The inscription on "Sunflower" says, "Naturally have the intention to turn to the morning sun, pity that there is no strength to fight the autumn wind," which is thought-provoking. The inscription on "Trumpet Creeper" says, "This flower has its own ambition to soar to the sky, not relying on other branches for support." The insects and fish are most notably "Fragrant Pond Warm Waves," "Mandarin Fish and Hibiscus," "Chicks," and "Carp." They are lifelike and seem to come alive. In the marvelous places, it is as if you are personally in the Yuquan Flower Alley, and after watching, you feel like you are meeting an old friend. Mr. Mengrong is not dead! Mr. Gongyu's works include calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy. The frames such as the He Family's certain stele are unlike those written by modern people. The seal script is taken from ancient seals, the official script is obtained from the back of steles, and the carving is taken from the Qin Edict plaques and bronzes. They are simple and profound, truly unseen for hundreds of years. Most of the paintings are of pines and chrysanthemums. Bai Hua Wenzhong calls Gongyu to have the ambition of Yuanming, and it is true. The light and heavy turns all take the method of seal script. It can be compared with Li Meian and Zeng Nongran, which is especially admirable. The couplets in regular, cursive, and running script are all transformed from the steles of the Northern and Southern Wei Dynasties and the pavilion posts of the Jin Dynasty. This is commonly seen by connoisseurs, and there is no need to praise it much. As for Shiling's landscapes, they are superior in simplicity, Bixuan's figures are superior in elegance, and Jingjuan's flowers are known for their beauty. All are outstanding works.</p>

<h3>Group A Table Tennis in the Chinese-Western Cup: Hua Yi Avenges Youbang; Qingyun and Hua Yi to Have Regular Finals</h3>
<p>In the Group A Table Tennis Tournament of the Chinese-Western Cup, last night at 7:30, the defending champion Youbang played against Hua Yi at the Jingwu Gymnasium. Both teams had elite soldiers and capable generals. The referee was Di Feiqian and the inspector was Chen Linsheng. Hua Yi had been defeated by Youbang in the finals of the Zongjiao New Six Two Cup.

<h3>Food Grains: Rice Stocks at Various Warehouses Total 1.8 Million Bags; Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai Continuously; New Orders for Imported Rice Also Being Transacted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's imported rice has arrived in Shanghai again. The Yihong Shipping Company's Fusheng Wheel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 10,000 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council's imported rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, 1,325 bags of imported rice are scheduled to be shipped to Tianjin on the same ship today. The Zhawu Postal Shipping Company's Zhibisha Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying over 6,000 sentences of imported rice and over 25,000 bags of corn from Java, berthing at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Today, 1,000 bags of corn will be loaded onto the Yihong Shipping Company's Fusheng Wheel for transport to Yantai (Zu).</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market initially fell, then rose, and finally returned to fatigue. The market gradually showed signs of fatigue. After the opening price in the morning, the selling pressure was strong, and the Shanghai Municipal Council continued to approve 500 tons of Pingjia Gongmai rice (a low-priced rice sold by the government) per day, totaling 1,000 tons over the two days. The price remained the same as before, but it was stated that if the delivery was less than the amount at that time, it would be compensated with small-grain rice. The wholesale price of Mingdang rice was 2.7 yuan higher than that of small-grain rice, meaning that small-grain rice was 2.7 yuan lower than Mingdang rice. The retail price, however, was 2 yuan higher for Mingdang rice than for small-grain rice. Furthermore, Chinese and foreign merchants continued to peddle futures and spot rice in the market, causing the price to fall by one yuan. Subsequently, due to the price drop, sales were strong, and inland merchants were interested in purchasing. The purchase of broken rice in the interior was even more active. Rumors spread that Siam Changdi would again ban the shipment. The stock reserve this week decreased, and people's hearts immediately turned upward, and the market price rose by one or two yuan with the strong buying pressure. As a result, spot broken rice was still relatively expensive, while other sales turned sluggish and returned to even. The amount of original English-Chinese company packages returning to the market was smaller than the day before. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon rice was 137.5 yuan, then 135.5 yuan, small-grain spot was 138 yuan to 137.5 yuan, road was 135.5 yuan, broken rice spot was 107 yuan, road was 105.3 yuan to 105 yuan. Today's transaction of Yinghua Company was nearly , spot . A survey of rice stocks at various warehouses showed a total of 1,087,877 bags.</p>
<p>During this moldy season, thick and thin japonica rice is easily . Although the arrival of goods is not sufficient, the owners have no intention of holding on, and the intention to sell is quite loose. At the same time, stores and customers also do so. In addition to slightly purchasing to meet needs, they also lack a large appetite for accumulation. As a result, transactions have declined, and the market has continued to soften, with prices falling by one yuan. Kainang Port fresh early and late indica rice opened at 34 yuan, and then to 131.5 yuan. No one inquired about old or secondary goods, regardless of the original packaging. Miri can do business, and thick japonica rice is still only old original packaged tin japonica rice, opening at 20 yuan to 118 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the market supply of glutinous rice is still scarce, the local goods have turned weak, and the road has also declined, making it difficult to sell. The market price has depreciated by one yuan. Hong Kong round-grain glutinous rice opened at 113-114 yuan, long-grain at 111-112 yuan, old yellow goods at only 107-108 yuan, special glutinous tea at 106 yuan, Chinese at 103 yuan, high-quality domestic goods sold for 112 yuan to 110 yuan, secondary at 16-17 .</p>
<h3>New Wheat Sold for the First Time</h3>
<p>The opening of the foreign flour market is still relatively stable. According to our investigation, the actual sales of this customer are not smooth due to the rapid rise in prices the day before. Furthermore, with the new wheat on the market, it is heard that futures have already been released, so people's hearts are naturally difficult to feel good. After Jinlong Flour was increased to 29.5 yuan the day before, buyers felt it was too expensive, so the opening price was only 29 yuan. Subsequently, due to slight sales to Nanyang customers, the price gradually rose to 19.2 yuan, with 2,000-3,000 bags transacted. There were also Fortress Flour at 30 yuan to 30 yuan, and Hongri Dangtian Flour at 29.5 yuan. The market is still brewing.</p>
<p>New Daily Xin handled 5,894 packages of Changzhou, Ben Niu, Danyang, Wuxi, and Chuandong goods, priced at 40 yuan. Half have arrived, and half are in transit. This is the first official sale at this price.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Broad Beans Arrived Sparsely, Turning Expensive</h3>
<p>New broad beans are of lower quality this year than last year, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities. Recently, prices have been high and goods are scarce, but customers are reluctant to buy. Moreover, most of the goods are transported by the street itself, so the market has only been open for three mornings, and then the downstream has already reported. (The highest price was 42.8 yuan, and the lowest was 39 yuan.) Recently, because the goods from nearby villages are scarce, it is inevitable to search in distant places, resulting in laborious bicycle transportation and increased costs. As a result, costs have risen sharply, and the arrival of goods has decreased, and the market price has increased accordingly. The day before yesterday, Qingpi broad beans from Beigang opened at 40 yuan, and yesterday's market was 40 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>On the 14th, miscellaneous grains were exported, transporting 350 bags of beans and 7,720 pieces of bean cakes to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat, and the black market for British and American exchange rates was stable with a slight loosening. The changes were even more subtle. Foreign banks were slightly willing to supply, so the July US dollar was loosened from 5.390625 yuan to a point where it could be settled. After being taken by speculators, it immediately returned to flat. The British gold also hardened back to 3 pence 3125. In the afternoon, it also returned to flat, while the US dollar remained stagnant, and no transactions were heard. The closing prices of both currencies were still the same as the previous day, and trading was extremely light.</p>
<p>Market situation changes are minimal</p>
<p>Since the morning's foreign telegraphic silver market, the British, American, and Indian markets have not changed. The exchange rate of each country rose by half a point against the British, and the rest did not change. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates have not changed. The domestic banks opened the selling price early, with spot British exchange at 3 pence 296875 and US dollars at 5.375 yuan. Foreign banks were willing to supply, so the July US dollar was stiffened to 5.390625 to a point where it could be settled. HSBC's listed exchange rates have not changed. The silver balance tax is still levied at 23.75%. Speculators made a hedging profit, entering the June US dollar at 5.375 yuan, and settling the July at 5.375 and 40625. The market situation gradually stabilized, and the British gold closed in the afternoon at 3 pence 3125, which was slightly stiffer, and the US dollar at 5.375 yuan.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Even More Stagnant: Deferred Delivery Was Traded Secretly in the Afternoon, Still at 25-26 Yuan Posted by the Bulls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in the shachi black market became even more stagnant. The difference throughout the day was only 16 yuan, and the closing price was unchanged from the previous day. The situation fell first and then returned, which was because the foreign exchange market suddenly showed signs of loosening after the morning opening. Huibing Shang Dafeng even emptied and sold more than 3,000 taels. Securities firms supplied more than demand, and the price fell to 6,453 yuan, which was absorbed and raised by another draft merchant. In the afternoon, it was heard that deferred delivery had already been traded secretly (at a price between 6,461 and 6,462 yuan, with the settlement price being close to 20 yuan), and the seller posted 15-16 yuan to the buyer. The scramble to cover floating positions was slightly more enthusiastic, and it rebounded to 6,469 yuan at the close, the same as the closing price of the previous day. The hearts of all parties are still stable, and the total transaction volume for the day was 12,000-13,000 taels. Cash transactions increased. First, Fukangyong sold ten taels to Yili, with the price 260 yuan higher than the deferred delivery price. Then, Shihe entered Xianghe for 150 taels, and Yongcheng for 50 taels, both 155 yuan higher. Later, Xianghe entered Fei Wenyuan for 100 taels, and also entered Shihe for 50 taels each with Jingfu, both 260 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Tianyuan exited Xianghe for 20 taels, 245 yuan higher. Suddenly, it was seen that the low, with a small cut of 5 yuan was recorded. Gold ornaments, custom gold, etc. were all flat.</p>
<p>Futures Without Change</p>
<p>Since the morning (10 taels), the market opened at 5:15 a.m. at 6,460 yuan, which was 9 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. It was raised to 6,465 yuan by Xinfengyong and retail investors. Huibing Shang Dafeng suddenly emptied, more than 1,000 taels were sold successively by Yida, Tongkangyong, Decheng, Yiyuan, and Shunyuan, and the May US dollar at 5.390625 yuan could be settled, so the price fell to around 6,460 yuan, and the price fell to 6,453 yuan, and the situation became more stable. Xinfengyong entered more than 200 taels, and gradually rose to 6,464 yuan at noon. The afternoon closing price was 6,461 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 p.m. at 1 yuan higher, calculated at 6,462 yuan. Juejian Sixty yuan, Gongda and Jufengyong bought, and some shorts also covered, and the price rose slightly in a stable manner, until the market closed at 3:30 p.m. at 6,469 yuan, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day.

<p>Ornamental Gold Stagnant and Unmoving</p>
<p>The outgoing price of silver shop jewelry was still 695 yuan per tael at Datongxing and Xintongxing, and the incoming price was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Slight Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: The shachi market was as stable as ever. British and American gold pounds did not change much. The British extra notes trended downward, and the market price fell by one yuan. The US dollar notes rose by one fen, and the evening market was 16.31 yuan. Hong Kong notes trended slightly softer, and the market price fell by 2 fen. Both Japanese and Korean gold notes trended slightly higher, with the former rising to 1.54 yuan and the latter rising to 1.64 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Rebound and Fall</h3>
<p>In yesterday's black market for government bonds, the market declined due to hovering. For a time, there were many new short sellers, especially those who borrowed goods and sold short. Because it was difficult to borrow C-type chips, the chips suddenly felt exhausted. On one side, the floating bulls released, and on the other side, the financial community was still absorbing them at a low price. The major long positions remained unmoved, and the market was temporarily slapped, but it will eventually go up the peak. Yesterday morning, Yu Da received hundreds of thousands from a bank, and Tongkang also had an intake. Defu Yichang Jiufu Jiufeng Renfeng Hengfu, etc. all purchased. Runli Yuxing Lianhe and other bulls were released, and Xiekang Runde Tongsheng sold again. Hongda first exited and then entered, and Lianyide first entered and then exited. Inner stocks then advanced to the 70 yuan level. The noon closing price was 5 or 6 jiao lower. In the afternoon, Runde Lianyi Yitai captured back, and Hefeng Yongkang absorbed, but Runli Yudian was still released, and Dingkang and Hengkang also released quite a bit. The market has been relatively stable, and after the close, there was a lot of borrowing, and the chips were extremely scarce for a time. It can be seen that there are many short sellers with no goods. As a result, the market price returned by a small 4.5 to 7.5 jiao. The transaction volume was about 2.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 100 shares of Wing On Company were transacted at a price of 18.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The public stock market is quite active, and the price is higher than the previous close. Yeguang shares were traded in huge volumes, and the market rose to 15.7 yuan at the close. Zhongying shares also jumped to 11.5 yuan. Xiangtai shares hit a high of 53 yuan and closed at 52.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson and Asia Navigation shares were both very firm, and the trading volume of the latter was amazing.</p>
<p>The board of directors of English Shanghai Worsted Mill Co., Ltd. decided to pay a dividend of 2 jiao and 5 fen per share in national currency for the year ended January 1941.</p>
<p>The Gibbon Oak Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson, will convene the 32nd annual general meeting on June 23 and pay a dividend of 3 yuan per share in national currency for 1940.</p>

HSBC Bank shares continued to rise, and British-registered shares rose another half pound, to 76.5 pounds. And Hong Kong-registered shares rose 1 pound, to 79 pounds, with offers but no buyers, and there were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Positions Strongly Defined; Yarn Market Wanders Without Progress</h3>
<p>The road of yarn and cotton is roundabout. This is because the actual transactions are not as strong as the previous day, and the Dutch-Indian issue is tense, causing the floating longs to soften. However, some firms are severely short of inventory and fear that there will be problems with raw materials, so they still take the approach of buying on dips to go long, and the market's single-unit stacks are still dry. Deferred delivery sellers are posting 2.5 to 7.5 jiao, but the shorts are very thoughtful. As for the longs, because they have interest income, they have no intention of releasing, so the lineup of both sides is very solid, waiting for the opportunity to develop, and fearing that there will be major changes. The high price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 1,465 yuan, and the low price was 1,400 white 58 yuan. The first trade in the afternoon was 1,461-2 yuan, and the last price was 1,465-6 yuan. The trading volume was not strong, but people's hearts were still high. Today, 420 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning. Due to the breakdown of the Dutch-Indian negotiations, the shorts were active and the table was weak. The first tight price was 1,400 white 60 yuan, but the big players still entered. However, most of the scalpers released, and after a while, it fell to 1,458 yuan. Then, with the price of gold flat, Shuangma still had transactions, and people's hearts , and it rose again to 1,465 yuan, but the intermediate form was mediocre, and it returned many times between 62 and 3 yuan. The closing price was 1,462 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics showed that 9,870 bales were transacted, of which 270 bales were entered by the Hong Kong gang, and 9,600 bales were transacted by the line.</p>
<p>The situation in the gold change Ma Biao yarn market is in a roundabout state, and the market is extremely stable. The July contract fell by 5.5 yuan from the previous month, and the August contract fell by 2 yuan. The market transaction volume was less than the previous day. The daily total was more than 8,000 bales. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Previous Market  After Market</p>
<p>July</p>
<p>Open 1390 1391</p>
<p>Close 1391.5 1391</p>
<p>Daily High 1394  Low 1390</p>
<p>August</p>
<p>Open 1400.5 1401</p>
<p>Close 1401 1401.5</p>
<p>Daily High 1405  Low 1400</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Soars</h3>
<p>The selling price of Middling is nearly 460 yuan. The current cotton situation is still firm. Factories have not had weak yarn sales recently, so they enter from time to time for raw materials. As for the industry, in view of the tense international situation, they are concerned that the source will be hindered in the future, so the sentiment is consistent upward. Fine cotton prices have reached new highs, and coarse cotton and local cotton have also risen. The actual price of spot cotton is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Middling 458  Xinsheng Factory 100 pieces delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Firegrass Package 198 Hefeng Factory 500 packages</p>
<p>And 197 Xin Shen Er Factory Pieces and packages</p>
<p>Dazhong hit 170  And 243 pieces and packages</p>
<p>Dazhong Sen 274  And 194 pieces and packages</p>
<p>Firegrass Package 189  Haojia 310 packages delivered from warehouse</p>
<p>And 190 And 415 packages</p>
<p>And 192 And 150 packages</p>
<p>And 191 And 848 packages</p>
<p>And 190 And 400 packages</p>
<p>Middling 444  And 400 pieces</p>

<p>And 448 And 100 pieces</p>
<p>And 445 And 300 pieces</p>
<p>And 454 And 200 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: Foreign trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai ports, factory demand is very strong, and the compensation is quite strong. At the same time, fellow traders are aware that overseas procurement costs are expensive, and people's hearts are unanimously optimistic, so the market has been active for several days, and many transactions have been made. Yesterday, in addition to the selling price of Middling being nearly 460 yuan, the remaining West cotton and Indian cotton have also frequently advanced. Brazilian cotton, which is a raw material for 22 counts, was transacted by a foreign yarn factory for 300 pieces at a high price of 430 yuan.</p>
<p>New York cotton market, first rose due to buying by fellow traders, but then fell back due to reaction sales and even rainfall. As a result, closing prices fell by about a pound compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is closed, and the forecast for the opening market situation today is to look at a small Robi.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Futures Fabric Prices Are Very Tight</h3>
<p>Factory Hope: The market continued to be strong yesterday, and the industry's mood was good. Customer sales were smooth all the way to Hong Kong and Nanyang. Various fabric factories' futures prices were very tight. English Jardine Matheson Factory opened futures for more than 2,000 , and the sales market for white goods and bleached and dyed fabrics was not moving. Some rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen per piece. The street transacted more than 500 pieces of various fabrics. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang helped to handle more than 400 pieces of bleached fabrics and coarse fabrics. On the 14th, 370 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Dongbu: The market situation is stable, with minimal ups and downs. White goods and fine fabrics are still soft. The closing price of Longtou Factory's single-unit stack was 44.6 yuan. However, the Tussah silk gabardine was hoarded by hoarders, and the price continued to be firm. The evening closing price was 1.445625 yuan, a rise of 5 li per yard.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's clearing: the latest goods of the Outer Bank for 24 coarse white were 91 yuan to 92 yuan and 3 jiao, and then fell back slightly to 91.5 yuan. There were also goods arriving in March and April at 90 yuan, 91 yuan, 91.5 yuan, then to 90.05 yuan to 90 yuan. Taikoo B mark was 108 yuan, DY was 95 yuan, HK was 88.5 , Dutch Chiri was 7 yuan, 69 yuan to 71 yuan, 70.05 yuan, old goods was 68 yuan, which was a good start of 5 jiao for the previous market's new coarse white. Old goods rose by 1.5 yuan. It was heard that the sugar market outside the market was still weak in coarse white. There were 1,500 bags of sugar coming from Hong Kong to Tianjin today. Yesterday, 3,500 white tons were transported from Java.</p>
<h3>Futures Sugar Settlement: Expected to Come to a Conclusion</h3>
<p>Futures sugar settlement: The market price in this period fluctuates too much, and people's hearts are difficult to stabilize, so the executive supervisory committee of the association held a meeting to discuss a compromise, and the buyer and seller handed over the settlement to the association for summary. Most of them have been completed, and only a very small number have not sent the funds to the association. It is expected that they will be cleared in the near future. If so, the entire settlement is expected to come to a conclusion.</p>
<h3>Hardware: American Tinplate Very Popular, Prices Rise to 500 Yuan; Black Steel Billets Inventory Low</h3>
<p>200-pound and 180-pound American double-joint tinplate are exceptionally strong, because the Tianjin gang of customers are enthusiastically scouring. The street's canning factories and printing factories are also actively purchasing. The opening price has risen again and again. Yesterday's market, such as 180 pounds per box, was sold from 460 yuan to 480 yuan, and 200 pounds of goods even rose from West 180 yuan to 500 yuan, a huge increase of 20 yuan each compared to before. Moreover, the flowing goods are very scarce, and wholesale transactions are temporarily impossible to collect.</p>
<p>Black steel billets: Due to the termination of overseas sources, the inventory in this city is scarce. After the manufacturers and traders in the street have successively transacted, the market is booming. The current goods are increasingly insufficient, and people's hearts are high, and the prices are also rising accordingly. Yesterday, a bundle of 2,000-pound new steel factory goods sold for 3,500 yuan, and a bundle of old steel factory goods required 3,600 yuan, which was more than 100 yuan higher than before.</p>
<h3>Coal: Tongdeli Coal Rebounds</h3>
<p>Tongdeli white coal: After a foreign firm distributed it, it was rumored that a certain company, the old manager, also had new goods arriving. Traders and agents were about to compete, and the black market once fell. In recent days, it has still failed to see the facts, and people's hearts have recovered. Take advantage of the low price to buy in. The old order price opened at 432 yuan, and the price rose by more than 10 yuan. The current car is slightly cheaper than the disc.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Yaoqian Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the scarcity of the arrival and storage of Yaoqian, the inventory feels thin. At the same time, the sales side needs to be very active, so the price has risen again by 30 to 40 yuan. Yesterday's market prices, such as white-skinned Yaoqian, sold for 200 yuan, and red-skinned Qian also reached 169 yuan. The market situation is excellent.</p>

<h3>American Missionary Comes to Shanghai from the Provisional Capital: Says Chinese Popular Morale is Flourishing, Not Afraid of Hardship, Possessing Unlimited Power, and Surely Able to Establish an Ideal New China</h3>
<p>American missionary James recently arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing via Hong Kong. He expressed great optimism regarding the flourishing atmosphere of Free China, and firmly believed that the Chinese people would surely obtain true freedom and be able to establish an ideal new China. Yesterday, a Daguan News Agency reporter interviewed him at a certain inn, and he kindly told us the following:</p>
<p>Enduring Pain with Strong Will</p>
<p>"I (James referring to himself)," after going to Chongqing in the winter of the year before last, resided in a church next to a mountain more than ten miles from Chongqing. Behind the church was a Chinese hospital, mostly filled with wounded soldiers and innocent civilians who had been bombed. I made it a habit to inspect the hospital once a week and comfort the wounded soldiers. However, their willpower was extremely strong. They expressed great anger toward those who had harmed them, but put their own pain aside.</p>
<p>Construction Spirit is Astonishing</p>
<p>"One day, it was bombed by Japanese planes. At that time, I happened to be in the city and witnessed a giant bomb falling into a slum. All I saw was a blaze of fire, but the residents of the area had already scattered during the first air raid siren, so the deaths and injuries were minimal. Only a little over two hundred simple houses were destroyed. I felt deeply sorry for the rubble, but three days later, when I went to the city for the second time, I found over two hundred neat thatched houses there. There were no more broken walls or ruins. After inquiring, I learned that the residents of the area had taken away the destroyed wood after the Japanese planes left and planned the construction work that night. Their construction spirit and agile actions were truly admirable.</p>
<p>United Struggle with Absolute Brightness</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. James said, "If the people of the whole country can continue to unite and struggle under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, then the future is absolutely bright, the ideal new China will surely be born, and all abnormal conditions can also be eliminated. China is an old friend of mine of more than ten years. I firmly believe that my old friend can obtain true freedom, independence, and equality."</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department's Salary Increase Proposal for Employees: Seriously Considered, the Bureau Organizes a Special Committee for Research</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of salary increases for Public Works Department employees, the Public Works Department proposed it for discussion at the regular meeting on the 11th. The Personnel Committee's opinion was conveyed. In addition to agreeing with the employees' request, it also suggested a 20% salary increase for senior employees. All sectors of the city believe that last year, as a result of the Public Works Department's across-the-board salary increase in November, taxes were increased by 40%, increasing the burden on the entire city, stimulating rising prices, and affecting the spread and expansion of labor strikes, and repeatedly resulting in the Public Works Department's budget deficit this year. Therefore, they attach great importance to this issue and have issued statements asking the authorities to pay close attention to it. It is reported that at the meeting that day, in addition to expressing sympathy for the employees' demands, it was also deeply felt that this year's budget deficit was 9 million yuan, and loans had just been taken out to overcome the difficulties. If the employees' demands are followed, there will be no such funds, and what method will be used to increase revenue? If the burden on the citizens is increased again, it will inevitably cause public resentment. Therefore, it was decided to retain the proposal and organize a special committee to submit it for consideration. The tasks of the committee are: (1) to study ways to increase revenue, (2) to determine the proportion of salary increases, (3) to pay attention to the impact on the general society, and to submit a concrete plan for discussion after it is drafted. Yesterday, a Western newspaper reporter asked the Public Works Department spokesperson about this issue, and it was said that nothing could be announced on this matter at this time, but a formal announcement is expected to be issued soon.</p>
<h3>The Business Tax of Money Exchange Houses is Temporarily Approved for Reduction</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department, regarding the request of money exchange businesses to reduce business tax, the bureau's board of directors has decided to approve the reduction of this business tax from 120 yuan per quarter (calculated according to the width of the storefront, 12 feet per section) to 75 yuan per quarter. On the one hand, this case will be left to the "New Tax Revenue Committee" for consideration. According to this, there are currently 69 such money exchange shops.</p>
<h3>Suspects in the Major Post Office Robbery Case are Requested to be Punished: The Stolen Money Has Not Yet Been Returned to the Post Office for Inventory</h3>
<p>After the major post office robbery case was quickly solved by the Japanese Military Police, all of the stolen money, 2 million yuan, was recovered. However, the Japanese side is still holding the money. Currently, Okada, the chief inspector of the post office, is negotiating. Regarding the personnel of the Savings and Remittance Bureau who escorted the money, including Wang Xuchu, director of the cashier department, two bodyguards, and three old workers, are still detained at the former site of the Wing On Silver Company in Hongkou. The post office will report to the General Administration to impose penalties according to the circumstances.</p>
<h3>The Christian Administrative Committee Began Yesterday: More Than Twenty Representatives Arrived</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of the National Christian Council Administrative Committee and the annual meeting of the American North and South Presbyterian Church members officially opened in Shanghai yesterday.

Dr. Mingdan will also attend the discussion at that time.</p>
<h3>French Lawyer Dasang Died from a Stab Wound Yesterday Morning: Met an Assassin Beside the Escalator in His Office, Shot Three Times and Died in the Ambulance</h3>
<p>French lawyer Dasang was suddenly assassinated on Rue du Consulat yesterday morning and died from his injuries in the ambulance. According to the French Concession, since the assassination of the legal advisor to the Gonghuang Bureau, Du Ge, this is the second such incident. The details of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Practicing Law for Thirty Years</p>
<p>French lawyer Rdauxionde Ruffe, 66 years old, from the Eure-et-Loir province of France, graduated from the Law Department of the University of Paris at an early age and obtained a doctorate in law. He once served as a judge in the Saigon Court. He came to Shanghai 30 years ago and practiced law as the first lawyer to appear in the French Concession court. His office was located on the second floor, Room 27, 41 Rue du Consulat, while his residence was at 54 Rue Massenet. He usually had a No. 11923 Buick car for transportation.</p>
<p>Hit by Three Bullets, All in Vital Parts</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after breakfast, Mr. Dasang, wearing a beige suit and a rattan hat, left his house after 8:30 and took a car directly to his office to work as usual. When the car arrived at the entrance of No. 41, it was exactly 9 o'clock. Mr. Dasang opened the door and walked into the building, walking up the stairs. Unexpectedly, four men were already lying in ambush. One of them was waiting beside the stairs. Seeing Mr. Dasang coming up, he took out a pistol and fired three shots at Mr. Dasang, all hitting him in the chest. He immediately fell to the blood pool beside the stairs, barely breathing.</p>
<p>Old and Weak, Died Halfway</p>
<p>When the nearby police officers received the news, they urgently telegraphed the police station and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. A temporary curfew was imposed around the scene of the incident for a strict search. However, the shooter had already fled far away after the incident, and no one was caught at the same time. Senior French police officers, such as General Supervisor Fa Bo'er and Criminal Minister Wan Langdeng, also personally visited the scene after the incident. Mr. Dasang was unable to speak. He was rushed onto an ambulance and sent to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment. However, Mr. Dasang was old and weak, and he lost too much blood and died in the car.</p>
<p>Dasang's Body Sent to the Morgue</p>
<p>After the incident, the French police transferred the body to the Tarast Road morgue for autopsy. Because the case was serious, the French police immediately summoned Jiang Rongtang, the tea servant of Mr. Dasang's office, to the police station for questioning to provide clues. One bullet shell was sent to an expert for examination. At noon, personnel were sent to temporarily seal off Mr. Dasang's office. It is reported that Mr. Dasang's eldest daughter currently lives in Qingdao, and his partner works at the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger in Shanghai. In addition to having a No. 11923 car, Mr. Dasang also has a No. 615 car.</p>
<p>Ms. Meiding Witnessed the Incident</p>
<p>According to the news from the English-language Great American Evening Post, Ms. Meiding, an employee of the Shanghai French Daily, was also on the scene when the incident occurred. She heard Mr. Dasang groan and say, "Those people fired a shot and hit my neck." Meiding asked if she had seen the perpetrator. He replied, "I don't know who fired the shot." After speaking, his breath was as weak as a thread. After a while, the patrolmen arrived after hearing the alarm and summoned an ambulance to rush Mr. Dasang to Guangci Hospital, where he died on the way. The police were able to disclose the motive for the case this morning. Mr. Dasang has lived in China for more than 40 years, mostly in Shanghai. He often wrote articles for English and French "Far East" magazines. Mr. Dasang was born in Paris in 1878. After graduating from the Sorbonne University, he practiced law and served as a judge in Saigon. He joined the army during World War I and participated in major battles such as Verdun. He was awarded a military medal. After the war, he returned to Shanghai and resumed his legal practice. He once served as the chairman of the Shanghai French Veterans Association. He wrote many books on Far Eastern events and Sino-French art. He once served as a Far Eastern reporter for the French Figaro newspaper.</p>
<h3>US Requisition of Ships: No Immediate Impact, Sailing Schedules of President Liners Remain Valid, Detailed Plans for Ship Requisition Still Under Study</h3>
<p>An official of the American President Lines said yesterday that the news agency reported that the US government requisitioned passenger ships sailing to the Far East. Shanghai has some concerns about shipping between the Far East and the North American Pacific coast. This may be an overreaction. The news agency's report can undoubtedly express the general situation, but it cannot be considered reliable.</p>
<p>Ships Sailing to Shanghai Will Not Suddenly Decrease</p>
<p>In addition to seeing what the news agency reported, the Shanghai American President Lines has not received any confirmed news that its business will be reduced. Therefore, the current sailing schedules of the ships remain valid, and tickets are still being sold as usual without reservation. It is indeed a fact that the government has taken over merchant ships, and there is no doubt about it. The American President Lines will certainly be affected. However, it is expected that at least in the short term, the number of ships sailing to Shanghai will not suddenly decrease.</p>
<p>Ship Requisition Methods Have Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>The company is well aware that the US officialdom's reaction to the world situation will involve the shipping industry in the Far East. Therefore, it is now waiting for concrete news from the San Francisco headquarters. The fact that it has not yet received this concrete news shows that the detailed methods of the ship requisition plan have not been drafted. It may be inevitable that the US ship sailing to the Far East will be subject to some restrictions in the future. However, the personnel of the President Lines in Shanghai believe that even if it is affected, it will not be very large. Other shipping companies have already shouldered the pressure of the government's requisition of ships, and the President Lines cannot afford to lose a single ship now. Unless there is a serious emergency, its business will not be reduced.</p>
<p>Tickets for Ships are Still Being Booked as Usual</p>
<p>Moreover, the loss of ships in recent times has been unprecedented, and all countries are fighting for survival. Therefore, anything can happen. For example, the "Empress" class mail ship of the Changxing Company, which usually sails to the Far East, has been suspended since Christmas. All ships have been requisitioned by the British authorities. Personnel of the President Lines said that it is too early to draw conclusions. So far, no official news has been received. Therefore, the company's tickets are still being booked as usual, and major changes are not expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Special Theater Tickets are Exempt from Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>According to the announcement of the Public Works Department, special tickets issued by theaters in the concession to personnel wearing uniforms are exempt from entertainment tax.</p>

<h3>Former President of St. John's University, Bu Fangji, Returned to the United States Yesterday: Dedicated 52 Years to Education in China, Alumni Warmly Saw Him Off with Deep Regret</h3>
<p>Dr. Bu Fangji, the former president of St. John's University in Shanghai, returned to the United States yesterday morning with his wife on the President Cleveland. Dr. Bu has been responsible for the school affairs of St. John's University since 1888 until he retired on February 1 this year, and was succeeded by Vice President Shen Siliang. Mr. Bu has traveled to China for 52 years, and he is usually enthusiastic about education and has devoted much effort to the cultivation of young people, and he is kind and amiable in dealing with people, and he is respected by people. He was born in New York, USA on February 22, 1864. In his early years, he studied at New York's Trinity School, Columbia University, and New York's Theological Seminary. In 1888, he came to China to engage in missionary work, and then he founded St. John's University, with many students and outstanding achievements. He married twice. His first wife was a Chinese woman surnamed Huang, who died of illness, and then he remarried. Mr. Bu is quite researched in Chinese, and he has written many books over the years, which have been widely circulated. He has four children. His eldest son, James, also accompanied him back to the United States yesterday. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the New Customs pier was crowded with people. His friends and students from all walks of life went to say goodbye to this friend of China. Mr. Bu and his wife and son shook hands with the well-wishers one by one and briefly talked about their parting feelings. Mr. Bu is over 70 years old, but he is energetic and comparable to a young man. When the whistle sounded, Mr. Bu and others boarded the ship with smiles and waved their handkerchiefs back, as if they were reluctant to leave.</p>

<h3>Amateur Sports Association Farewell to Zha Ruilong to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Sports Research Association was founded by people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about sports. It has always published sports books and held body-building exercises. It has made many contributions to promoting mass sports. Now, the chairman of the association and martial artist Zha Ruilong will go abroad again at the invitation of Chao Chao-chun, a wealthy overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Therefore, a banquet was held at the Dadong Restaurant the other day to say farewell. Those present included Feng Zhiyin, Yang Lin, Shi Zhengzhong, Wang Zehuai, and other 50 people. They toasted and talked, and the hosts and guests had a good time. They dispersed at about 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Artist Zhang Chongren</h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>The artist Zhang Chongren is extremely accomplished. He studied in France and Belgium at an early age and graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels with first place. He won the Albert Gold Medal from the Belgian King, which brought glory to the country. The Chinese Embassy in Belgium specially awarded him the Sanji Medal to encourage him. His solo exhibition upon returning to China caused a sensation in the Chinese art world. Xu Langxi, the principal of the Xinhua Art College at the time, and other famous figures in the art world went to evaluate his works. Seeing his sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and pencil works, all of which were extremely accomplished, he exclaimed: "This is an all-rounder in the art world." At that time, Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Cai Jiemin, Ye Gongchuo, Huang Hanliang, and other art lovers came to visit and competed to buy his paintings, and all of his works were snatched up.</p>
<p>After this exhibition, Zhang buried himself in the studio again, living in seclusion. He never carelessly completed a painting by accumulating paintings. Once a painting was completed, it must be purchased and collected by a private individual. As a result, he has not held a solo exhibition in the past five years. Fellow art lovers urged each other, and had no choice but to repeatedly collect the sculptures and paintings scattered in Shanghai, and publicly exhibited them at the Xiqingnianhui on Jing'an Temple Road (next to the International Hotel) from June 15 to 19. According to Zhang, "I feel it is troublesome to have an exhibition every five years." This is really an opportunity for art lovers to feast their eyes on a collection of masterpieces in one place. The picture above is Zhang's oil painting "Compassion". When the author stands in front of the painting, he suspects that he is the person in the painting. It can be imagined that the painting is lifelike.</p>
<h3>Summer Hygiene Campaign</h3>
<p>The Summer Hygiene and Health Campaign sponsored by the YMCA officially opened at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Baixianqiao venue. Although there was no ceremony, a large number of visitors from all walks of life attended. The exhibits included charts, statistics, pathogens, pathology, prevention, microscopes, and health elements. There were physical examinations and health lectures in the afternoon, and entertainment and movies in the evening. The meeting will last for three days and will close at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Rice Supply to Shanghai to Change to Mintang Rice: But the Public Works Department Has No Official Statement, Its Selling Price May be Further Reduced</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, reporters learned from foreign firms yesterday that foreign firms in Shanghai received telegrams from their counterparts in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government, in view of the fact that the route of Yangon small-grain rice has become wider and the inventory has decreased slightly, but the Mintang rice has a continuous source and a weak route, so the inventory is abundant. It has ordered a temporary ban on the transfer of small-grain rice to other places, but Mintang rice is allowed to be exported in large quantities. The special Yangon small-grain rice directly supplied by the Hong Kong government to the Shanghai Public Works Department is also in the prohibited list. The Hong Kong government has telegraphed the Shanghai Public Works Department that the Pingmi (stabilized price rice) shipped to Shanghai in the future will be changed to Yangon Mintang foreign rice, and the first batch can be loaded and shipped to Shanghai in July. According to rice industry sources, the last batch of special Yangon small-grain rice supplied by the Hong Kong government will arrive here on the 19th of this month. However, the Public Works Department has not officially stated the above points to the outside world. According to general people, the authorities may find a way to suppress the selling price of Mintang rice in Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Pingmi is Not Being Sold</p>
<p>The Public Works Department is holding Yangon special Mintang rice. The rice sample was brought to Shanghai from Hong Kong the other day and stored in the Liji and Xiangmao foreign firms for the rice industry to observe the color when ordering. It has now begun to order. According to shipping industry sources, the Fusheng ship, which arrived at the port at 10 a.m. yesterday, carried 10,000 bags of flat-price small-grain rice and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf. In addition, the Yuansheng, Yusheng, Taiyuan, and Ninghai ships, each carrying 10,000 bags of flat-price small-grain rice, will also arrive at the port in the next few days. Recently, it was heard that some unscrupulous people used the name of the Pingmi agency staff to go to various rice shops to sell certain goods at a high price. A few rice shops have purchased them because it is difficult to refuse a favor. There have been more than 20 cases. Until yesterday, the Pingmi agency staff began to realize it. It is heard that they have generally notified the rice shops, stating that the Pingmi agency staff have not been selling any goods outside, and hope that the rice shops will not be fooled again.</p>
<p>Rice Truck Workers Arrested</p>
<p>Daguan News Agency said that the transport of rice in Shanghai was mediated by the Political Department of the Public Works Department, stipulating that small quantities of rice should be transported by small carts, and large quantities should be transported by trucks in four out of ten cases. Those who are far away are also transported by trucks. The truck and small cart industries have jointly formed a soybean and rice industry transportation cooperative to prevent disputes and rice grabbing incidents. So far, it has been peaceful for months. However, on June 6, the investigators of the co-op were monitoring vehicles transporting goods on the Erbai Du Bridge, when they were suddenly beaten and humiliated by the Chinese police. On the afternoon of the 10th, when vehicles were loading goods at No. 2 Wharf on the Bund of Wuma Road, four people were arrested for as long as eight hours, and the armbands approved by the Political Department were detained. They were returned after negotiation the next day. Yesterday, the resident police at Wharf No. 1 refused to allow the small carts to approach the wharf to load goods, and detained 23 small carts and 23 workers in the police station, and sentenced them to fines. All the small cart workers had asked the Rice Shop Association, the Soybean and Rice Shop Association, and the Political Department for instructions yesterday. If a satisfactory solution is not obtained, they want to strike again.</p>
<p>Investigation of Rice Storage in Warehouses</p>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, the survey of rice storage in the 118th issue (from last Thursday to this Thursday) has been officially completed. A total of more than 90 Chinese and foreign rice warehouses stored 1,087,877 bags of rice. The rice storage is limited to Chinese and foreign warehouses. As for the rice sold at the door of rice shops, the rice stored by residents, and the rice that has been ordered by various civil food organizations and transported to Shanghai, they have not been investigated. It is estimated that the total amount of rice is about 850,000 to 60,000 bags, so the total amount of domestic and foreign rice in the city must be more than 1.9 million bags.</p>
<h3>Generous Donations to the New Puyutang: Enthusiasm From All Walks of Life Undiminished, More Than 70,000 Yuan Still Lacking This Year, Still Hoping That Readers of This Newspaper Will Continue to Donate</h3>
<p>The New Puyutang in Nanshi is a famous Catholic charitable organization. It has a nursery, an orphanage, an old folks' home, and a disabled people's home, accommodating nearly a thousand orphans, elderly, and disabled people. Under the leadership and education of the Sisters of Charity, it is no different from a paradise for the poor, sick, orphaned, and helpless. However, since the outbreak of the war, donations have decreased sharply, and supplies have increased sharply due to the soaring prices. Those who have been accommodated cannot be repatriated, and those who should be accommodated cannot bear to be rejected. Therefore, it is becoming more and more difficult and almost impossible to continue. After this newspaper sent staff to visit the site, it felt that such arduous work should not be allowed to stop. Therefore, it appealed to the readers of this newspaper. For several months, it has been generously responded to by all walks of life. From January to April, more than 100,000 yuan in donations has been received (detailed in this newspaper on May 12). The donation report for May is now prepared by the church and summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Donation Results</p>
<p>In May, a total of 11,270.8 yuan in donations were received, 4,600 yuan in fixed monthly donations, and 5,314 yuan in donations in kind, totaling 21,188.8 yuan. Among them, Yu Ziying, Yuan Yang'an, and Yi Jun's fundraising by Wang Jun of 3,000 yuan was the largest. Mr. Lü Guicong and his children visited the church and assumed a monthly donation of 50 yuan, which is commendable. The detailed list of donors and amounts will be published in this newspaper by the church at the end of August for combined thanks.</p>
<p>Expenditure Report</p>
<p>In May, 15,200 yuan was spent on food, 2,879.48 yuan on vegetables, 597.96 yuan on water, 678 yuan on coal, 408 yuan on clothing, 298 yuan on medicine, 1,312 yuan on repairs, 900 yuan on kerosene, 683 yuan on wages, and 199 yuan on transportation, totaling 23,155.44 yuan. Among them, the food can be used until the end of August, and the kerosene can be used until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to Continued Donations</p>
<p>The current situation of the church is slightly better than before, but it is still far from being stable. According to the budget, there is a shortfall of more than 70,000 yuan this year. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that enthusiastic readers will continue to donate generously. Those who have not donated will donate generously, and those who have donated will donate again. Funds and goods are urgently needed. The amount of the donation is appreciated. The places to receive donations are: (1) Savings Bank Trust Department, 460 Hankou Road, (2) Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Sassoon House on the Bund, (3) Jihuatang Pharmacy, 47 Yunnan Road, (4) Huamei Pharmacy, 156 Fuzhou Road, (5) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street. The places to receive donations in kind are: (1) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Passports from Shanghai to the British Burma(Today's Myanmar) Yangon</h3>
<p>The number of travelers from Shanghai to Hong Kong to Yangon or transferring to the mainland is increasing. The Burmese government's inspection procedures are extremely strict.

According to the China Travel Service, the procedures for travelers to Myanmar are: (1) Obtain a passport from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (2) At the same time, forward it to the Passport Department of the Hong Kong government for approval by the Burmese Ministry of Interior, (3) After the Burmese government approves it, the applicant must submit a "Visa Application Form" to the Passport Department, and the Department will reissue the review notice. The application form and passport should be sent to the Chinese Civil Affairs Department and sent directly to the Passport Department. After three days, the applicant can go to the Passport Department to request a visa. After the procedures are completed, they must carry a smallpox and epidemic prevention certificate before purchasing a ship ticket.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Silver Shops are Developing Abnormally: More Than 40 Have Been Established This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai silver shop industry has recently shown an abnormal development trend. New establishments are springing up like mushrooms after rain. Before the war, there were only more than 30 silver shops in the city. Now, the number has increased to 140 or 150, and there are no fewer than 70 or 80 silver shops that have not joined the association. That is, in the first half of this year, the number of newly established silver shops has increased to about 40. In recent days, there are still five or six silver shops that are being prepared and will be opened soon.</p>
<h3>Trolley Passenger Dies Innocently</h3>
<p>At 2:10 PM the day before yesterday, an unidentified man, Mr. A, around 40 years old, wearing a Xiangyun gauze shirt and black Guangdong silk shorts, holding a piece of fresh meat, was riding a trailer of Shanghai French Tramways Company Route 1, No. 81, traveling from Xavia Road westward to eastward. When the trolley reached the front of No. 442, the man was dozing off, when suddenly a commotion arose in the car. Passengers rushed to avoid something and as the car door was not tightly closed, passengers opened the door and escaped. The man, in his drowsiness, was jostled and fell out of the trolley, thus suffering injuries. He was sent to the hospital by the patrol station, where he died despite treatment. As the patrol station could not trace any family members, the body was sent to the coroner's office. After examination yesterday, the body was photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping for Ransom: Several Kidnappers Arrested and Detained</h3>
<p>Wang Jinsheng, Peng Bingsheng, Zhu Wanjun, Wang Shusheng, and other Chinese detectives of the Central Patrol Station, previously arrested and detained eleven kidnappers, including Liu Shoushan, Xia Baohe, Wang Taihe, Xu Xinzhi, Liu Depei, Xiao Tangtai, Wu Xiao'erzi, Zhang Chuncai, Zhang Dazhuangzi, Chen Futian, and Chen Fenglou, from No. 15, Jiu San Li, Fiaer Road, and No. 989, Jing'an Temple Road, and other locations. They were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. An investigation revealed that Liu and others had committed two kidnapping cases: (1) On October 12th of last year, at 12:45 PM, Huang Xuanping, manager of the Northern Inspection Company, was kidnapped on Hart Road (Huang was kidnapped inside his private car, No. 546), and a ransom of one million yuan was demanded. The kidnappers were eventually paid 43,000 yuan. (2) On April 23rd of this year, at 12:15 PM, Yu Jingqi, the sixteen-year-old son of Yu Shen Qifang, residing at No. 6, Lane 775, Julida Road, was kidnapped in front of the Moore Memorial Church School at No. 316 Yu Qiaqing Road (also kidnapped inside his private car, No. 13351), and a huge ransom was demanded. The kidnappers were eventually paid 110,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened court to hear the case. The defendants retained lawyers Wang Yaotang, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted them for the crime of kidnapping for ransom and also accused them of robbery, as the defendants had allegedly committed two other robbery cases. After questioning by Judge Feng, an order was issued for continued detention pending a future hearing.</p>

<h3>The Indirect Bomber</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>A few months ago, when relations between the United States and Germany were deteriorating, the German side, in an attempt to please the Americans, invited American citizens through shortwave radio broadcasts to express any opinions to the German government, with the German side paying the telegram fees. Unexpectedly, many Americans took advantage of this convenience to harshly criticize the German government, with one telegram hoping for Hitler's early funeral. This shows a glimpse of the resentment in people's hearts.</p>
<p>Recently, Americans have taken a more imaginative approach to aid Britain, organizing a "Bombers Ltd.," which has special connections with British bomb manufacturers. Any American citizen who wants to quickly bomb Germany can go to "Bombers Ltd.," choose an aerial bomb, pay the bomb fee, and specify that the British Royal Air Force bring the bomb to Germany and drop it. After the British Air Force personnel drop the selected bomb, they send a receipt by airmail, thanking the indirect bomber, explaining that the bomb has been dropped, and specifying the time and place of the bombing.</p>
<p>This is indeed a novel wartime business. However, these indirect bombers have existed since ancient times, because in our lives, we are all invisibly indirect bombers, some bombing for the forces of light and good, while others bombing for the forces of darkness and evil.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Scientific Methods of Killing</h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>The smell of gunpowder not only permeates the human world but has also extended to the animal kingdom. In some provinces of the United States, a type of crow called the white-beaked crow is a nuisance to the countryside and is extremely detestable. Farmers cannot eradicate them using ordinary bird-killing methods, so they have learned group slaughter methods from the European fires of war. They bury several time bombs in the trees where these pest birds roost, and the effect is excellent. When these "thugs" who like to caw loudly are sleeping peacefully, the bombs suddenly explode, and a flock of pest birds is reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>A certain African chief once borrowed a submarine from the British government, specifically for laying mines to exterminate crocodiles. Crocodiles are a scourge in his territory, so he also wants to rely on gunpowder for group slaughter.</p>
<p>The high-intensity electric furnace can kill mosquitoes, which is a discovery. When this electric furnace is turned on, it emits a humming sound that travels far. Large numbers of mosquitoes, attracted by the sound, gather like moths to a flame and rush to their deaths on the electric furnace. All the mosquitoes burned to death are male, because the sound emitted from the electric furnace is exactly the same as the mating call of female mosquitoes. In view of this fact, the United States Public Health Service has created a special mosquito-killing device, shaped like a radio, that emits a buzzing sound that is twice as loud, causing amorous male mosquitoes to throw themselves into the net.</p>
<p>An engineer, at the request of a mushroom farmer, invented a "fly-suction fan." Flies, smelling the odor of fertilizer, fly to the place where mushrooms are grown and are sucked in by the fan, leaving them with no way out. The inventor also installed a "cold air ring" on the fan to freeze the flies, causing them to fall into an iron can. He provides these frozen flies to frog farmers, which can be said to be a good use of waste.</p>
<p>Among all kinds of pests, locusts are probably the most hateful. Swarms of locusts block out the sun, and when they land, they quickly eat up the crops for several miles around. Sometimes a swarm of locusts can gather into a patch ten miles wide and twenty miles long. How astonishing is their number! Unfortunately, they can also die from firearms. The firearm used to kill locusts is the "flamethrower" used by the German army in the past to attack the British army on the Flanders battlefield. A light and portable cylinder filled with paraffin wax is installed on the back. A leather tube is attached to the cylinder, with a nozzle at the end. After the cylinder is filled with expanding gas, flames are sprayed from the nozzle, reaching up to ten yards. The locusts are violently sprayed by the roaring flames, leaving corpses everywhere. Killing locusts with sweet bran containing arsenic is also very effective. Locusts that eat the poisonous bran scattered on the ground will not jump as usual on the first day, lose direction and become paralyzed on the second day, and die on the third day.</p>
<p>A person driving a car unintentionally discovered a clever way to kill snakes. After his car stopped, a poisonous snake suddenly bit the tire, its terrible fangs piercing the tire. Unexpectedly, before its fangs could be pulled out, its abdomen was filled with gas leaking from the tire, causing it to burst and die.</p>

<h3>A Little Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>Perhaps my soul is fragile. Sad people often say with a sentimental and poetic tone, "You are a very sensitive person!"</p>
<p>No matter how clumsy the player is, as long as he plucks a string, a faint sound will be produced. It can accuse, it can show that he still has a bit of life force, it can vent his emotions, it can immerse his soul in the middle. Why not become beautiful music, and why bother seeking the appreciation of the general public?</p>
<p>It may not resonate on my heartstrings, perhaps I simply don't understand (how pitiful!), I believe that's what he wants to say, therefore his words will be equally respected by me.</p>
<p>Although I am pitifully stupid, I am not prepared to admit it completely, because I still have a little self-confidence, believing that I still have a little of the "correct" component. I am prepared to live in this little self-confidence.</p>
<p>A little self-confidence is not stubbornness or conservatism. In the eyes of the wise, it is naturally still "pitiful," but for those with this little self-confidence, it will always be regarded as a treasure.</p>
<p>I once looked up at the early summer night sky, letting the coolness seep into my shoulders. Maybe I will feel a burning sensation on my forehead in the middle of the night, and tomorrow will bring a cough. I am still willing to do this often, because I saw the twinkling of the stars in the quiet night and appreciated the profound beauty. I also seem to understand this mystery.</p>
<p>So in the dream of this night, I wove a blue-colored vision, groping in the darkness. I received the faint guidance of starlight.</p>
<p>It is said that young people always can't escape a beautiful vision, without the ability to analyze it deeply. But I think it won't be wrong, although no one can objectively point out whether that vision is scarlet, blue, gold, or without any color.</p>
<p>No one is urging, and no one is forcing, like the leaping of a river, there is no force that can stop its progress.</p>
<p>There will be setbacks, but you believe that the power of this reaction will unleash such great ability!</p>
<p>I am willing to caress my wounds, wipe away my tears, and come again!</p>
<p>That's the little bit of self-confidence I have.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>Begonia furrowed his brows and sat on a bench, staring blankly at the kerosene lamp.</p>
<p>He remembered when he deposited these two sums of money into the Dong Province Colonial Bank and the Fuhua Bank, several people had advised him that these two banks had too deep a relationship with those warlords and politicians, and that they would easily be affected in the future. But at that time, he regarded Yuan, the garrison commander and his nephew, as close relatives, and hearing that they often associated with important military figures from these two banks, he finally deposited the money without hesitation. Later, when he talked to Xiangqi about this matter, she also felt it was inappropriate, but the term had not yet expired, and she was embarrassed to ask Shaowen to take it out for him first. Unexpectedly, he was now regretting it!</p>
<p>"Dad, you said you would send me to school in town after the New Year. Just now the old man told me that our family will be eating sweet potato porridge again in a few days.... Dad, when are you going to buy me a schoolbag?" Meibao carefully hid the photo album and sat on the edge of the kang, her tired little eyes wide open, looking at her father's back and asking.</p>
<p>Begonia didn't hear her. The bank's matter had made him lost in thought.</p>
<p>"Dad, why aren't you talking?" Meibao immediately put on her leather shoes and walked to Begonia's face, leaning against his knees, looking up at her father's ugly face.</p>
<p>"Good girl, it's getting late, go to sleep first!" He gently picked up Meibao and walked to the warm kang.</p>
<p>Meibao smiled foolishly at him all the way, taking off her coat herself, while Begonia watched distractedly.</p>
<p>"Sleep well, child!" (132)</p>
<h3>Air Raid Warning Signals</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>People in Shanghai have probably noticed that there is a very thin and tall building on Avenue Edward VII by the Bund, which is the signal tower of the Observatory. Whenever a hurricane is approaching, a warning signal is hoisted on this tower so that ships in the port can prepare in time and move to a safe area.</p>
<p>Recently, Germany has also used similar equipment to supplement air raid warnings. In the city, the sound of sirens reporting air raids can be heard by anyone, but people in the suburbs have no way of hearing them. Therefore, they have set up air raid warning posts near gas stations on the highways, so that gas station employees can hoist the air raid warning signal when they receive the alert. People in cars on the highway can clearly see this yellow and blue signal and know that there is an air raid.</p>

<h3>Innovation in Eastern Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Xi Di</p>
<p>The Oriental Spoken Drama Theater, starting today (14th), has joined hands with the Huaxia Drama Society to perform new-style spoken drama in a popular form. This major change, this new reform, undoubtedly illuminates the future of the drama movement. Naturally, we welcome those experienced actors of the civilized drama with great talent to gradually approach spoken drama. At the same time, we are also extremely willing for those viewers of civilized drama with potential influence to gradually recognize spoken drama. One aspect is the self-training of the actors, and the other is the improvement of the audience's level. That news will make anyone who hears it very happy.</p>
<p>Orient has always been hovering between civilized drama and spoken drama. For six years, under the planning of Guan Jian, the director of the drama department, more than 200 plays have been performed, with more than 800 stage performances. Most of them are tragicomedies that cater to ordinary audiences, such as *Interpreting Flowers*, *Red Apricot Out of the Wall*, and *Spring Breeze Dreams*. They are very popular, but strictly speaking, they are far from the level of spoken drama and are very backward. Therefore, this major change, this new reform, is good news for the entire spoken drama circle.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reform, they are still an adventurous attempt. In order to promote the enthusiasm of this movement and also take into account the various obstacles in the environment, they decided to invite a large number of directors and actors from the film and drama circles to participate. Playwrights and drama critics such as Huang Lu, Mao Yu, and Jiang Liu also took on the roles of writers and directors. As for the existing outstanding actors such as Song Xiaotian, Xuan Qiwu, Wu Taixu, and Dan Saiwen, they will still be retained for cooperation.</p>
<p>The currently planned plays are:</p>
<p>(1) *An Ideal Husband*, (2) *Love and Hate*, (3) *Newlyweds*, (4) *Hypocrisy*, (5) *The Rouge Shop*, (6) *The Rampant of Human Desire*, (7) *Life Events*, (8) *In the Night of Joy*, (9) *Money Tree*, (10) *The Phantom of the Opera*.</p>
<p>Each play will be changed every five days. It is planned to finish performing them in fifty days.</p>
<p>Regarding the results of this experiment, it still depends on their own efforts and the cooperation and help of all sectors of society. The reporter also sincerely hopes that the drama workers in the Orient can indeed bury their heads in hard work, not be afraid of difficulties, not retreat, and always remember the mission they shoulder.</p>

<h3>Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Biography by Nan Lu Bei Diao Ren, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(13) Zhang Junqiu</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu is an actress specializing in Qingyi roles and is a rising star in the Dan roles of the last seven or eight years. Originally from Suzhou, his original surname was Teng. His father, Teng Lianfang, married actress Zhang as his wife, and Junqiu took his mother's surname. He joined the Pear Garden in Beijing at a young age, and then entered Li Lingfeng's school, specializing in the Qingyi path. Li was a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, so Junqiu is a second-generation disciple of Yaoqing. After completing his studies, Ma Lianliang supported him with all his strength. In 1938, he specifically brought him south to perform at the Golden Grand Theater. Ma was the main attraction, and Junqiu was second. He is elegant in appearance, quiet in demeanor, bright in voice, and stable and natural in his singing style. He became an instant sensation when he first came to Shanghai. The Pear Garden in the capital has four famous Dan and four small famous Dan, and Junqiu is one of the four small ones. Last year, he followed Lianliang on a second trip to the south, and his reputation grew even more. It is said that he will come with Ma again in the autumn, as he is still under contract with Golden.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Every Ten Chapters: Gongsun's Sword Qi, Part One</p>
<p>Xu Jing thought to himself that although Liu Yining's martial arts were good, he was always a bit shy when he saw a family, like a daughter. If he were a woman, wouldn't he be a character like Hongfu Nu? After a moment, Liu Yinying returned to his room. Servants were already there to serve him. After washing and grooming, the two went out to see Wang Yongtai and had breakfast together. Wang Yongtai said to Xu Jing, "Now that the misunderstanding between us has been eliminated and the harlot is dead, there is no need to dwell on the past. Please stay at my house. It's inconvenient to go back and forth if you live in the mountains. General Zhou's yamen will also need you to go there every day. Now you can't pretend to be sick anymore." Xu Jing looked at Liu Yinying's profile and said, "I've lived in the mountains for a few days and find mountain life very enjoyable. Since you, uncle, are kind, how dare I disobey? How about I go to Weifeng Mountain with Liu Jun and chat for a few days, then go down the mountain?" Wang Yongtai could only say, "That's fine." Liu Yinying said, "If General Zhou has a summons, he can send someone to the house at any time. I and Xu Jing will definitely obey." Wang Yongtai said, "Very good." The two said goodbye to Wang Yongtai and returned to Weifeng Mountain. Liu Yinying told his aunt about seeing General Zhou. His aunt told him to go down the mountain less and recuperate quietly in the mountains, firmly keeping Xu Jing to accompany her nephew for a long time. Therefore, although Xu Jing had been proven innocent, Wang Yongtai still wanted him to stay, but he found the time in the mountains very enjoyable and didn't want to leave. Every day, he and Liu Yinying walked on the mountain peaks, wrote papers under the windows, drank wine in front of the lamp, and danced with swords in the garden. The two were like magnets attracting iron, sharing the same goals and interests and becoming good friends. Before they knew it, another seven days had passed. On this day, Xu Jing was about to go down the mountain to see Wang Yongtai. In the morning, he and Liu Yinying stood under a big tree in front of the gate, enjoying the cool breeze and the mountain scenery. Suddenly, they heard the sound of bells, and an official rode a horse up the mountain. Recognizing that the official was General Zhou's confidant, they quickly greeted him. As soon as the official saw Xu Jing, he reined in his horse, jumped off his saddle, wiped the sweat from his head with one hand, and said, "Okay, I found you. General Zhou has a letter here, please General Xu go down the mountain immediately." Xu Jing couldn't help but be stunned when he heard this. The official took out a letter from his arms and presented it, saying, "You two are having fun in the mountains, but you don't know that the bandits already have a vanguard coming to attack Daizhou City." When the official said this, his face was very nervous, and his voice trembled a little. It turned out that the clouds of war had enveloped Daizhou City, and a great battle with blood rain and swords was about to begin. (89) End of Chapter Ten</p>
