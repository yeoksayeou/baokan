<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨日宣稱、美國對日政策並無變更、赫爾氏此項發言、係在報界會議中、答覆關於羅斯福總續星期二演說中避免提及日本一節之問題、因總統相信日本之商界或卒將起而反對日本之軍人領導也、（三十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統週二演詞、屢言及希特勒而加以抨擊、但對日本則絕少提及、致在此間引起總統取悅日本、欲勸其說離軸心之謠言、而國會所發之不具名言論、在各處印發者、又以可證明此謠言之不書虛偽、故咋日午後國務卿赫爾招待新聞謂者時、舉此相詢者頗多、但赫爾僅以美國對日政策未有變更答之、惟上述謠言殊不難說明之、查此謠言顯然來自渥勒買州、而渥勒貢以袒日著聞、亦猶加州之以反日著聞、日本為渥勒貢州最好主顧之已此謠言之所由發生也、就赫爾美國未變其對日政策一說察之、美國現仍視日本為軸心整個部份之一、因此認日本政策亦如德、義政策、以仇美為能事也、華盛頓近且滿佈重慶與東京間議和可能性之謠諑、但負責方面不但未證實之、且表示將以更多援助給予中國、以助其對軸心一部份之作戰、不過此種援助之運抵中國、較諸運抵英國為稍緩耳、中國現牽掣日本、而使其陸軍不能用於他處、同時日軍似無深入中國或强令中國屈服之能力、而歐洲方面則英國需助孔殷、俾扼制歐洲之軸心、此美國供應品之所以儘先述往英國也、一俟對英接濟稍多、則美國經過太平洋之援華供應品、自將大增、而不似今之遲緩矣、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<p>東京　日方宜稱、松岡本日重申三强公的為日本外交政策不可變之基礎、日本將遵守三强公的云、松岡之為是言、係欲攻毀美國欲使日本脫離軸心、松岡謂、此項消息係根據於惑人之消息、並且係有意散布云、松岡力言日本將繼續依附軸心時曾謂、「依據近衛首相及余本人歷决所發表之文告、及日本政策之後來演變、各人對此皆應明瞭」云、松岡叉謂、日本之南進政策係一和平之程序、但如國際問之發展、使此項政策不能行時、則日木或將小得不照依變史之情狀、而重行考慮其態度云、（三十日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>平準基金會美代表　福克斯抵檀香山　據稱力謀中英美密切合作　詹森提中國作戰有利報告</h3>
<p>火奴魯魯　中國平準基金委員會美代表福克斯、昨在搭飛剪號赴重慶途中抵此、據稱、平準委會之最初目的雖在穩定華幣、惟借此力謀中·英·美之進一步密切合作、亦為現實之圖渠稱、該委會希望以物力相助中國發展對外貿易、並應為中國復興建設程序中之重要因素云、（三十日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>如何爲貧困之羣衆</h3>
<p>自百物騰貴，一般生活受嚴重之壓迫無論巳；即社會公益慈善事業，若育孤養老，矜恤殘廢，施醫給藥，粥飯煮振，以及掩殮瘞埋諸事業，莫不有經費匱乏，給養不繼之虞。蓋原有之經費，僅以應經常之用；今則一切非常，何來此非常之經費，以相挹注；於是而彌補已窮，而將伯頻呼；而有待於社會熱情人士之協助，固事理之所必至者也。無如生活之壓迫愈深，待振之羣衆愈甚。有如疾病不能無，而醫藥之費，非中流之人所能負荷，於是而羣趨施醫給藥之門矣。飢餓不能忍，升米數千文，乃有晨起不遠一二十里之奔波，乞食於南北兩地施粥之所矣。經戰事之摧殘，孤人之兒，寡人之妻，老失所養，幼失所怙，而顚沛流離，轉輾溝壑，蓋有不勝其收養者也。何况餓莩載途，路斃不絕，掩埋瘞歛，漏澤為滿，此又涉於公共衛生，不容一時中輟者也，執此諸端，孰非人羣之無告，而為人情所不忍。夫自甘墮落，流浪街頭，，固社會之蟊賊，任其自為生滅不為過；然具不忍人之心者，猶且慨然有憐憫之意，不惜予以援助。則有孽非自作，情非得已，苦海同淪，棖觸何之，而獨無動於中，可乎？不為援助，得乎？若是則於社會為冷酷，人羣為寡情，諒非所以語於上海之社會也。不觀新普育堂為給養而募捐，十萬元之經費立集。土山灣孤兒院事業，方披露於本報，捐款已絡繹而來。又如同仁輔元堂，慈聯會，濟生會之施粥廠，其他各種平飯醫藥掩埋之團體，同得各界人士之熱情贊助，更是報不絕書，以是見上海人士固不乏「為善最樂」之人，亦即各種公益慈善事業經費竭蹶中之一綫曙光也。</p>
<p>雖然，公益慈善，美名也；於是有冒竊其名以為美，慈善乃居然名「家」，是以慈善為職業矣：呼之者固無謂，受之者不自赧，誠兩失之矣。夫救濟，本為人羣應有之義務，允其在中國之倫理道德觀念，從親親仁愛，推而至於宗族婣戚，社會國家，周急濟貧，視為當然。此固人人應如此存心，而不能使人人能盡其職責，於是有錢而不能出力者，盡其出錢之義務；有力而無錢可出者，盡其出力之義務；錢力能兼出者則兩者均出之，亦無非盡其所應盡，為其所當為而已。故以辦理慈善事業而斤斤自伐，沾沾自得，引為己力，是與貪天之功何異，不祥孰甚。若以辦理慈善事業，為可造成聲望，博得地位，則又何殊視若龍門，捷如南徑，豈事業之本意？至若意別有在，而假藉慈善之名，則等而下之，更卑卑不足道。此非吾人故意有所苛求也；良以人心不同如其面，薰蕕不難於同器。要知辦理公益慈善事業，受公衆之付託，謀救濟之實現，豈止如救焚拯溺，不容遲疑；直須念一錢一物，無論其來自公私，要皆為心力之結晶。宜如何善體斯意，念物力之維艱，思來處之不易，而期款不虛糜，振歸實際，是固辦振人員應有之義也，不僅如是，人方以善舉，為能救濟相屬望，如或辦理不愼，名不副其實，原欲以救濟之者，焉知不適以重創之，原欲生之者，焉知不適以殺之，故辦理不得其人，非徒糜費冒濫，實且百務叢脞，常得其反，允其為水火兵燹之急振，事起倉卒，臨時措置，非饒有辦振經驗者不辦。夫旣欲辦公益慈善事業，祇知有公，不計及私，勞心勞力，固分所應爾也。即雇用之人員，半盡義務，亦必對於辦振有深厚之興趣，非徒為瞰飯之地而後可。苟一念及於振款振品，皆為振濟待振者而來，則分配宜如何求其公允，保存宜如何求其周密，事務宜如何求切實，母負施振者之用心，此亦辦振人員應盡之責也。故辦振之要，首在得人，而所謂得人也者，亦無非能實心實力而已！苟人人抱戰戰兢兢臨深履薄之念，以為苟有不當，罪業皆集於一身，自必錙銖不敢私，用人求其當，無敢草率從事，受振者皆蒙實惠，而善舉斯舉矣。</p>
<p>顧辦振固應如是，要必賴社會人士之協助，而進行斯無虞中道而畫，辦事乃得專誠致一。無以為此乃善團人士之責也，而袖手旁觀。亦無以所捐助之錢物，慮為經手者所侵蝕，而一毛不拔。要知在捐助之立塲上，宜以大衆之疾苦為懷，母以少數人之人格是問；祇問救濟之是吾重要及捐助之應分與吾！如其應分也，則不應存我有施人之見，亦不必作人有受施之想，更不必計及所施之物，如何處置，但盡其心之所安，力所能及，果有不盡不實，是辦振者之過也。惟是辦振者未必皆有名，有名者未必有其實，故求捐款之收效更切實更宏大起見，應於捐助之先，明瞭其所欲捐助之事業，成績如何，良則不待人之相求，而解囊相助，可使實心辦事不求人知者，亦知事實所在，社會人士自有公論，知所勸勉，益形奮勵。今各種事業皆為物價所厄，苦於費絀，而待振又倍甚於往昔，是誠各界協力維持之候也。惟是捐助之款不論多寡，愼無以為微末而自慚，遂不為捐助，要知聚沙成塔，皆自微塵顆粒而來，只要盡心力之所能盡。亦無以席豐履厚，而於救濟貧困，漠然無動於中，以為不與我相干也，要知世變無常，人情可慮，勳華輿臺，孰能保其無，盍不於豐厚之時，預種善根，以免為富不仁之誚。近如炎夏眴臨，醫藥事業，允為切要，原有之施醫給藥，擇其成績素著者，固當以大衆之力，維持於不墜，或加擴充，以應暑令之濟急。然必慎選醫藥，以人命為重，而不以振濟為名，但求形具。滬人士，素以樂善好施聞於世，富於恤貧救窮之同情，今當此緊急關頭，必多自動發心，稍節口腹之慾，應酬之費，用以興辦維持社會事業，固已綽綽有餘。聞風興起，想不致河漢斯言也。</p>

<p>倫敦　英外相艾登昨在倫敦市長室對聽衆數百人所發表戰後經濟與社會改造之英國計畫、使歐洲疲於戰爭之人民發生新希望、此决演詞乃對納粹黨徒所唱歐洲新經濟秩序」之答復、艾登說明（一）德國改造歐洲之計畫、僅使他人在精神與經濟上為奴、（二）惟英美始能供給歐洲所亟需食物之與原料、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英外相艾登昨在倫敦演說、謂羅斯福總統巳指示世界自由國家之途徑、而成就信仰的與政治家風度的大事業、總統演詞之要旨、在宣布自山國家之存在終必繫於海洋之自由、此義亦適用於英帝國、而具有同等力量、總統此决播音乃世界大事、總統已以其詞句表示地球上最强國之固定決心云、艾登言及伊拉克謂、伊國攝政自數日前返國以來、即接到今國各處矢忠擁護之文、其數不可勝記、而前為阿里蓋蘭尼之友者多已出奔、故此自命為狄克批多者、不久當小能立足於伊國自英國絕無不利於伊拉克獨立之任何企圖、英政府對於叙利亞欲得獨立之願望、亦寄以多大同悄、許多阿刺伯思想家欲為阿刺伯人民謀取較今更大的統一、而期望英國對此之援助、此種籲請來自英國友人者、英國定有以應之云、</p>
<p>艾登繼言及歐洲之將來、與精神上及物質上改造、謂世人勿謂吾人欲恢復獲世界之紊　、他日和平復臨時、吾人應寬弛戰時金融辦法、務使國際貿易在可能的最廣大基礎上恢復其繁榮、吾人應希望得覩國際滙兌制度之發展、庶在此制度中貨物與事業之交換可得資財之合作、而過此過渡時代、社會安全必須為戰後吾人對內對外政策中之第一目的、吾人願與他人合作、以阻止休戰時期後之飢餓與貨幣之紊亂及工作巿塲中與貨價中之在大波動、德國必須參加此事、惟吾人所必不可忘者、德國乃歐洲從未前有之惡劣主人翁、吾人將使政治上與軍事上和平條款、可阻止德國暴行之復演於將來、</p>
<p>戰事結局何時可至、人莫能預料之、但此結局終將如機構之運行倐然來臨、如德人之無警吿打破和平、然渠言歐洲之改造時、並不忽視一種解決可影響他處發展及因他處發展而受影響之事實、所謂他處發展者、如遠東者即共一例云、艾登來稱、整個大陸之永遠解決與內部和平、乃吾人唯一目的云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>兩民治國目標相同</h3>
<p>華盛頓　英國遲遲未宣布其戰爭目的、此間多謂英國以作戰致勝為第一要務、故不暇及此、又有人謂、英國之不官布其目的、實別有用意、今英外相艾登竟宣布英國戰爭目的、此在美人觀之、其詞旨與時間之得當、罕無其匹、此間現所接者、雖懂為艾登演詞簡略要點、然已引起各界多大興趣、而發生兩大民治國向同一目標並進之感想、無疑的艾登之言定為美報所歡迎、官塲方面現尙無正式批評、惟不難推知者白宮與國務院聞此言論定形歡忭、艾登為人寗願犧牲職位而不願盲徒綏端方法、此間極欽佩其人而曾願其為駐美大使、故此人而發此言允為動聽、（三十日路透電）</p>

<h3>軍委會　發表一一週戰况　二十三日至二十九日</h3>
<p>重慶　軍委會發表一週戰况自二十三日至二十丸日、軍委會發言人談、本週戰况各地日軍均有蠢動、華軍間亦有出擊、不見何者為重而國人及國際人士則深切注意中條山之戰、今將中條山之戰作一整個報吿、俾讀者得一整個輪廊、至於其餘各戰况補述於後、日軍的（第十四决中條山掃蕩戰）、山西的各交通點綫大半為日人所佔據、惟四面各大山岳地帶始終為華軍所保有、允以中條山地區進可以威脅同蒲南段各地、退可以憑河自保、日方以為他的臥榻之側、豈容酣睡、於是發動所謂（中條山掃蕩戰）、一次不成、繼之以再、再至於三、三年來巳達十三决之多、每次不但目的未達、均負創棄械而退、因是惱羞成怒、且際此即欲解決（中國事變）期間、於是下最大決心、調集各路大軍、大舉發動所謂（十四决中條山掃蕩戰）、其情况如左、（一）</p>
<p>事前部署</p>
<p>、日軍此次向中條山大舉進侵、在四月前即已開始秘密準備、於四月初先將駐開封之原田師團調集於沁博附近、再將商邱之騎兵旅團、徐州之田中師團、由隴海亦轉集於此、再將贛北之櫻井師圍、亦由隴海調集於陽城沁水附近、以為東路兵團、臨汾地區淸水師團、及太原之池上獨立旅團、晋東之片山獨立混成旅團、則扼駐綘橫道上以為北路兵團、晋北之某獨立混成旅團、晋東南之井關、晋南三角地帶之安道等師團、則集結於張茅大道及夏縣一帶、以為西路兵團、（二）</p>
<p>戰門經過</p>
<p>、各路於五月七日開始蠢動、傾其全力以圖打擊華野戰軍、其（A）東路由溫縣沁陽經孟縣濟源西侵封門口、（B）北路由綘縣橫嶺關等地向南直侵垣曲、（C）西路由夏縣及張茅大道東侵王家河台柴村、東北一路由陽城沁水及翼城之張馬侵董封、華軍早巳有備、常即與日展開惡戰、經華堅强阻擊、雙方死傷均重、各路日均不得逞、日竟使用大量毒氣、復藉優勢空軍之協助、先後侵入垣曲封門口邵源鎮台柴村等地帶、華迎擊日東北路之部隊始終屹立董封迄百花村之綫、迨垣曲被日攻陷後、華中條山部隊巳被分為二部分、其在綘垣大道以西部隊仍與日對峙、於畈澀河山地以東部分仍雄踞同心鎭迤東北一帶山地、垣曲之日遂東侵邵源鎮與西侵封門口王屋之日會合、打通濟垣大道、完成包圍網、一齊向綘垣大道以北之各部隊進侵、華洞燭其隱、於是分別轉移外綫脫出日包圍網、而予以反包圍、所以近日沁水高平西北地區內均有五晝夜之激戰、濟垣大道西側陽城週圍戰鬥亦極激烈、至華絳垣大道以西某部隊亦進達聞喜新絳間、而與日作殊死戰、刻各路均正如期進展擴大戰果中、（三）</p>
<p>斥日言</p>
<p>此役讕日聯隊長上田少將陣亡在台柴村附近、時華王竣師長亦壯烈殉職、在大的戰爭中將領陣亡亦恒有事、詎日施其一貢造謠之作風、而向國際大肆宣傳、反誣華損兵若干、折將若干、此種讕言殊不値識者一笑、故余上早加闢斥矣、（四）</p>
<p>最後結論</p>
<p>日之目的在肅淸中條山所謂捕捉華野戰軍而殲滅之、實則華野戰軍不但未被殲滅、且已進攻達聞喜新綘浮山翼城附近各地區、至於戰果、山西南部日司令部二十二日電謂華遺棄屍體四千二百、俘虜的二千、南京日中華派遣軍報導部發表、謂華遺棄屍體三萬五千、俘虜八千、山西某地二十五日同盟電謂華遺下屍體千餘具、另五百六十五人被捕、上海二十七日電、根據日軍發言人宣稱則謂、華死五千零四十二人、被俘一萬二千九百四十六人、傷者不明等等、各執一說、數量懸殊、蓋不根據事實憑空造謠、自然不能一致、戰鬥有死傷為當然之理、即如所云華方傷亡三萬、估計日亦死傷三萬有奇、同蒲路北運廢鋼盔三列車、運城解縣二地一日焚屍達二千餘具之多、即此一點、以概其餘、如此、日欲完成佔領區之（肅淸計劃）、以解決所謂（中國事變、當屬夢想、</p>
<p>浙東華軍</p>
<p>於二十日攻克諸暨城後、即沿鐵路錢獵續北追、使日無喘息機會現華軍已越臨浦白鹿塘、正向蕭山城壓迫、同時餘姚上處兩重要據點、亦先後為華攻克、上海日軍發言人於二十四招待外籍記者、其言有曰此决諸曁戰役可擬為蛇雉之鬥華軍採取新月形蹇圍戰術、宛如一蛇環繞雉體、但結果雉已振翼而飛云云、一向躊躇顢預的日軍、於此亦自承浙東敗績、</p>
<p>鄂南方面</p>
<p>通山橫林橋馬橋柏墩金牛等地日於二十一糾集二千餘分向上下泥愜張家街張家鋪一帶進侵、華予以痛擊、日不得逞、日乃增援至三千餘、華復施展鐵鎚、到處擊破日人、迄二十四日、華日仍在大墓山一帶激戰、</p>
<p>奧東方面</p>
<p>日自前週遭華巨創後、惠陽博羅已難立足、惠陽城於二十一晨被華攻入、博羅城於二十二晚將日驅出、是役日軍死傷不少、現華軍仍繼續向日追擊、石龍淡水俱在華猛攻中、</p>

<p>其他各處</p>
<p>贛北由瑞武路汪家山向雷公塘進侵之日、巳為華擊退、箸溪方面進擊之華軍現仍與日對戰於康古坪洞口一帶、湘北忠防桃林南犯日巳遭華痛擊、刻正在大雲山以北地區激戰中、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福演詞　松岡拒絕評論　日報則鼓吹對美一戰　並謂海軍已準備完成</h3>
<p>東京　東京日文報紙今日大事登載外相松岡對羅斯福總統演說之評語、渠謂「無評論之必要」、「朝日新聞」謂松岡對新聞記者之答語「辭簡意長」、報知新聞稱、松岡復謂、「第一余未見此爐邊談話中新鮮之處、再者、其語調亦較前為弱」云、（三十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　日日新聞撰評批評官方最近鄭重聲明日本增强國防之文吿時稱、「日本已決定與任何挑戰之國家作戰、並巳完全準備」、該報此决評論、係針對海軍新聞股主仟平出大佐之宣言而發者、平出云、「吾人已絕對準備」應付任何事變、平出此語、由東京每一日文報紙所揭載、並用巨大標題指稱、日本巳完成國防、並有軍艦五百艘、飛機四千架、平出大佐向全國廣播時曾稱、美國一旦與德國作戰、「太平洋問題即將立即影響日本」、因三角聯盟故也，又稱、美國一旦對德宜戰、前者將採用「游擊」戰略、俾毀減日本之「海上貿易及交通」、渠稱、惟此種戰略將不致「嚴重進行、一如歐戰」、亦不能予德國對付英國者相提並論、又稱、除三角聯盟之責任而外、日本並將被逼作自衛戰爭、俾能「克服敵國之經濟壓力」、惟「日本不必一定强逼德國作戰」、平出又言、日本不能明言在此世界局勢中、是吾將參加戰事、惟一旦遇有必要時「吾人巳完全準備」、日日新聞之社評、擁護此項演詞、認為日本之眞正願望、雖為在東亞及世界樹立和平、無意危擾太平洋之局勢、惟仍決定與任何挑戰者作戰、此乃美國所應知者也、日日新聞稱、美國加入歐戰、現已為時日之問題、此事將立即影響日本、日本為三角聯盟所繫、或有參戰之可能、又言、「所可欣慰者、日本現有設備齊全之海軍、復有強大空軍之助、決不致為任何國家所戰敗、當局發表關於日本海軍已準備應付任何事變之文吿、乃係重作保證、（卅日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　此間負責方面人士稱、美總統羅斯福所發表之廣播演說、已予日本以喘息時間、惟將來如何、則頗堪憂慮、在羅斯福總統發表演說之前、日本所考慮之主要問題、厥為該國是吾即將被迫參加歐戰、以牽制美國對德威脅、日政府對於此一問題、原擬保守秘密至湘當程度、俾在全國保持鎭靜狀態、第不知羅斯福總統是吾將對德宜戰、或僅決定派艦護送軍火接濟英國、俾使日本不得不履行三國同盟條的所載第三條條文、捲入歐戰漩渦、以應德·義兩國造决要求、羅斯福總統此决演說、並未直接宣布實行護航、致使日本所當解決之微妙問題、得以暫時擱置、至於日本輿論、則咸認羅斯福此項演說除聲明該國決當繼續援助中國而外、曾避免刺激日本、亦未涉及太平洋問題、可知其重在英國問題、而將日本問題暫置腦後、以免强迫日本立即授入柏林懷抱、可知羅斯福此種審愼態度、實巳迎合日本之審愼態度、日美兩國敵對行為、雖巳日見表面化、但究竟尙未正式決裂、似此、松岡外相此後即當向兩方面採取外交攻勢、即一方面對美設法保持現行局勢、俾日本得以避不捲入世界大戰漩渦、翼方面對華利用現有喘息機會、設泱解決「中國事變」特羅斯福總統對於目前雖未作過甚之辭、對於將來、仍使日本頗為不安、蓋美國恢復海洋自由一項政策、足以引起美、德衝突也、（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（五）（九）　炸彈下倫敦的文化</h3>
<p>在十七八世紀報紙尙未成為一種勢力的時期，英國一般著名作家都以發行小冊子為號召輿情最有力的媒介。降及近世，這種宣傳方法巳鮮有人注意，在此决歐戰期內，却又時髦起來了。</p>
<p>小冊子盛行的原因，一方面由於各報縮小篇幅，沒有充分地位供人發表意見，評論時局。在另一方面，長篇著作受時局瞬息萬變的影響，難於適合時宜。出版商對於一本在發行前巳成明日黃花的書籍，自然不願有刊。但印行六十四頁的小冊子，決無風險，它可以在一禮拜中寫成，兩禮拜中印就，立刻行銷全國。</p>
<p>著名作家和出版商現在因都競向發刋小冊子的路走。有幾種小冊子，每冊定價六便士，且非舊書再版，全是簇新村料，大模大樣地堆在書店櫃台上，銷塲之佳，有如出籠饅頭</p>
<p>寫小冊子的作家中，不乏出色人物，如安吉爾爵士Nor　man　Angell，穆爾Ramsay　Mnir，尼哥爾遜Harofa　Nicofson，史蒂特Wickham　Steed。甚至大名鼎鼎的威爾斯，也不以寫作六便士的小冊子為目貶身價。至於一般權威學者及史家，更不惜為三便士書出賣腦筋。無論何人出此十區區代價，就可選購牛津大學出版公司發行的任何一種時論小冊。這種小冊子在將來的至國文學歷史上，能吾和十七世紀的小冊子等量齊觀，雖難逆料，但至少對於社會必能發生一些影響。</p>
<p>「現代生活與文學」雜誌編者郝林曾發牢騷說，著作家在戰爭時期，比別種藝術家，更無出路。畫家許其到戰塲寫眞，以備國家保存，作家就沒有相等的權利。此公的論調實在並不中肯，因為文學家們同樣有觀察戰時後方的機會。即使超過軍役年齡的人，倘若高興寫作，也不愁找不着大好材料呢。</p>
<p>戰時文士的生活各異化趣，大抵以轉移現實為主。例如勒曼女士說，她諸事都不耐煩，惟有讀名著小說淮遣。華爾波爾亦說，他自開戰以來，每晨起床前，必讀莎士比亞劇本一幕，趣味津津，從未中輟。</p>
<p>文學批評塞爾曾在曼哲期德晚報上說，他現在喜歡研究形而上學和自然詩歌，把自己生存在瘋狂的現實和白晝夢想的兩個世界裹。他並且以為戰時讀物莫過於名家日記。小說太嫌空虛，傳記足以使人振作，但不能擺脫現實，歷史呢，歷史正在製造中，無所可讀。詩歌呢，似乎可以一讀了，但正如愛倫坡所說，最偉大的詩歌不能享受到半小時以上。只有日記恰到好處。</p>
<p>但麥克卡泰另抱一種見解，他以為處此多難之秋，讀詩如能心領神會，實比小說有益。詩歌使人獲得片刻的人生經騐，讀者如能體會詩人的經騐，就有左右逢源之樂。所以他正攻讀詩歌。</p>
<p>開戰以來，書籍的銷路，已一落千丈，據出版年鑑統計，去年度出版書籍僅一萬零七百三十二種，較前年度减少四千一百七十九種，的跌落百分之三十九，其中以少年讀物滯銷最甚，决為小說，社會學書籍，科學敎本，筆記及游記等</p>
<p>英國出版業的另一重難關是捐稅問題。政府新預算案中曾把商品稅分為兩類，奢侈品課稅百分之二十四，其他物品連同書籍在內，課稅百分之十二。報紙和期刊亦當繼之課稅。下議院討論此案時，議員漢勃特首先表示反對，以微收書籍出版稅為荒謬絕倫。他說「智識稅」在一八五〇年至一八七（）年間，早巳剷除，並確立精神讀物免稅的原則，歷兩次大戰而未變，現任財相豈得妄加破壞。同時下議員諸公並組織「保衛書籍委員會倡導反對書籍捐稅運動。這事在倫敦，有人謚之謂一書籍之戰。」</p>
<p>最後由工黨某議員提出修正案，謂書籍稅為數甚微，且足以影響出口業，不如豁免為妥，財相覺得有理，決定接受。但「保衛書籍委員會」認為這種初步成功，無永久性質，不擬遽爾解散組織。不過這種「書籍之戰」可謂已吿一段落了。</p>

<h3>全市米商所有米糧　一律報局登記　已到者應報明堆存棧名　未到者應塡報裝運途徑</h3>
<p>兩租界　局、鑒於各業工潮之此起彼伏、及社會秩序之不寗、殆為米價疾漲所致、茲兩當局對於抑平米價曁穩定民食、頗不遺餘刀、新聲社記者昨向租界當局探悉、現兩當局對於穗定民食、決將採取更有效辦法、刻巳論令豆米雜糧兩業公會、囑即轉知全體同業會員、即日起、無論到貨途貨之國洋米糧、一律向當局翔實塡報、俾有所正式統計、據悉、當局此項措置、事前曾作縝密之研討、誠為制止米糧轉運外埠、及取締操縱囤積之唯一有效辦法、據悉其登記方法、內分（甲）已到進棧者、（一）堆存棧名地址、（二）堆存數量、（三）米糧類別、（四）貨主姓名、（五）貨主住址、（六）進棧年月日、（七）米糧來價等項、（乙）未到者、（一）代辦之洋米、（二）裝米輪車、（三）抵達日期、（四）米自何處、（五）訂貨人姓名、（六）擬進何棧、（七）米糧類別、（八）來價若干、（九）訂　人行號名稱及地址等項、</p>
<p>添領港米今可核發</p>
<p>連日米市塲內、因內地及轉口幫略有採購、一般米　又乘機活動居奇抬價、因之各零售米號、同時將價抬高、居民相率購買平價港米、致米號銷數激增、各雜糧行乃粉向祥茂洋行請求添購、目下正在審査中、至各行能分派若干數額、今日上午或可宣佈、叉據晋豐米號函稱、前載該號受停售港米處分一節、茲經向立基洋行査明、係登記重複、致生誤會、業已仍向打家出貨經銷矣、</p>
<p>達孚洋行二次拋售</p>
<p>法租界公董局為抑平運滬銷售之貢米巿價起見、曾於日前分令各經辦貢米洋行、凡嗣後無論運辦貢米高决各貨、於抵埠後擬拋售米行、時不得私自開價、一律須由該當局核准、今各洋行均巳遵論照辦、故此後本市所售之貢米市價、將逐漸低落、法商達孚洋行日前曾拋出一·二號西貢混合碎米、每包市價為九十八元八角、昨據該洋行消息、日昨又拋出碎米約四白五十噸左右、每包市價由法當局核准為丸十七元五角、截述價格、係洋行售與米行、至於米商轉售、即給以百分之八或五之豐厚利潤、</p>

<h3>法郵船霞飛號　昨未啓椗　傳船員忽起紛擾</h3>
<p>昨悉、法國郵船公司之霞飛號郵船、離滬駛越南之期已展緩、衆信此乃該船船員起紛擾所致、傳聞該公司燃油之船數艘、航行於上海與越南間者、因燃料匱乏、即將停駛、又昨（三十日）晨外間盛傳法國郵船公司各船航期、有予取消者、此說頃經該公司遠東總經理柯希德予以吾認、惟柯氏對霞飛號原定二十九日出口、然展明至昨晨仍未駛出一點、拒不說明其理由、消息靈通人士稱、霞飛號行將啟椗時、船員忽起紛擾、其詳情現尙未悉、聞諸另一方面、法國郵船公司燃油之船、均將停航、燃煤之船、則繼續航行如常、該公司某員謂、該公司之船、又望有五艘於六月十日前抵滬、足見各船並未完全停航、</p>

<h3>電力臨時附加費　按照美匯核算　電力公司昨已公告實行　依照現行匯率可望核減</h3>
<p>工部局核准公共租界公用事業、於七月一日起加價後、上海電力公司昨日發出公吿稱、「茲經上海工部局核准本公司之請求、在各類供電之基本雷價上、除現行之外匯及燃料附加費外、另增一種、</p>
<p>臨時附加</p>
<p>費、此項附加費、為百分之五十、而以美金五元二角五分合國幣一百元之匯率為根據、並按照外匯附加費所規定之程序、每月由工部局與本公司同意依匯率之伸縮而調整之、該項新訂之附加費、應適用於一九四一年</p>
<p>七月一日</p>
<p>或以後終止之用電期內之賬項、並受本公司所接受各項條件之限制、」其時黑市外匯、曾縮至美金五元一二五之最緊價、故有此核算率、惟現在黑匯已放長至五元四〇六二五、計放長五檔之多、（卽五元二八一二五、三一二五、三四三七五、三七五、四〇六二五、）目國際形勢惡劣、黑滙尙有續長之可能、故新附加費之核算率屆時必能减低</p>

<h3>剖腦目睹記（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 顯理</p>
<p>粟醫生用棉花蘸了碘酒，，在病人頭殼的右面剃光頭髮的部份擦着，彷彿是理髮師在客人的頭上擦髮油一樣的鎭靜。在重覆擦了幾通以後，開始在要開刀的部份注射大量的局部麻醉劑了，先行皮下注射，然後施行肌肉注射，病人的右部的頭殼彷彿是碰痛了似的，腫起了一個小阜。</p>
<p>注射完畢了，粟醫師拿起刀來，在那小阜上劃了一個兩吋半長的「王」字，上下兩劃比當中一劃短了一半。這個記號是後來開刀的張本。</p>
<p>護十遞過一塊白帆布，當中有一個窟窿，把病人的頭部遮蓋了，祇留出那個長長的用刀寫在肉上的『王』字。粟醫師像母親在替嬰孩換尿布似地，熟練地拿起兩個別針，把那塊布別在病人的頭皮上。</p>
<p>粟醫師　起鋒利的小刀，照着病人頭上「王字的一竪，劃了下去。皮破了，血流了，護十把夾子一根一根地遞過去，粟醫師接了，往病人皮下的血管出血的地方，一一夾住。血停流了，我卜卜亂跳的心，也才安定下來。</p>
<p>粟醫師照準傷口，往下再割，在動手術以後的十五分鐘中，巳經割到病人的腦殼，白色的腦骨，赫然呈在兩吋半長一吋多寬的紅色肉縫裏。</p>
<p>休息了一下，用吸水管隨時把血液吸去了以後，粟醫師拿起了一根大鑽，在病人的腦殼上旋着鑽着，一位助手右旁邊滴着一種透明無色的液體。粟醫師費了不少的力氣，才能把病人的腦殼鑽成了一個一分鎳幣大小的圓洞。把那塊圓形的腦殼骨拿了出來，粟醫師用英文隨口說，「她的骨頭倒是挺硬的？」</p>
<p>利用這個小小的圓洞做據點，粟醫師用鉗子把病人的腦骨一小塊一小塊地挾出來，挾成了一吋半見方的洞，病人的腦膜在骨洞裹跳　着。</p>
<p>病人在昏迷中發生着呻吟聲，『痛然哉！痛煞哉！』助理醫師和護士小姐都笑了。病人再呻吟，『要死脫快哉！』粟醫師用手拍拍掩住病人頭部的帆布，吸水機的馬達聲和病人的鼾聲父攪成一團了。</p>
<p>利用那塊小小的根據地，粟醫生用他那靈巧的手腕在開拓地盤了。他有時用刀，有時用電，有時用吸水機，有時用鉗子，有時用棉花，有時用沙布，有時用骨蠟，一步步　向病人的頰部挖下去。吸水機馬達的損壞曾佔去了一部份小必耍的時間，除此以外，手術的進行可說是十分順利的。</p>
<p>粟醫師找到在病人頰上作怪的那條神經時，已經靠近三點三刻了。這時，粟醫師停手了，問看護小姐病人的血壓怎樣，脈搏多少，再可囑助手替病人注射補血針，然後把血肉縫中那點白色的神經指洽兩位旁觀的醫師和我看。接着，他用刀，也用電，把那根神經毀壞了。</p>
<p>「你要看人腦嗎？」粟醫師轉過頭來笑着問我。我說不出甚麼說來，祇點點頭。他把病人在頭骨縫中跳動着的腦膜剪成一吋多長的破縫，人腦赫然呈現了。</p>
<p>手術完成了，病人少去了一塊腦殼骨，同時也少去了神經所受的痛楚。像縫衣婦一樣，粟醫師從護士手中接過夾半圓形的針和羊腸線的夾子，一針針地替病人把傷口縫上，由一位助手打結，最初是縫肌肉，先縫了兩層，後來再縫衣皮一次。</p>
<p>助理醫師在替病人包紮傷口的時候，巳經過叫點半了。我們眼看粟醫師踏出了手術室。槳醫師拿起骷髏樣本來，津津有味　把剛才解剖的部份說明給我們聽。他說剛才所毀壞的那條神經近旁，有着大血管和其他的神經，偶一不慎，病人就有性命的危險。好像探險家叙述他冒險的經過和驚險的經歷似的。</p>
<p>我重新踏入了更衣室，脫了白帽，解了口鼻罩，脫去了血跡斑斑的白衣，重新穿上了原來的衣服；踏出更衣室的時候，粟醫師又在狠命地洗刷手臂了。</p>
<p>步出紅十字會的時候，巳經五點鐘了，五月的炎陽照射着一個又乏又累的冒牌醫生的身體。他的肉體疲乏，可是他的精神為了醫學界的神續而興奮着，他歌頌着醫學的進步。（完）</p>
<h3>外籍旅行家暢談　自由法國情況　人民缺乏營養面有菜色　反對德義切望英國獲勝</h3>
<p>外籍旅行家某君、因政治原因、不願宣佈其姓氏、曾在法國遊歷四月、最沂抵滬、昨對記者稱、自由法國區域內、人民大受飢饉之息、不久且有發生疫癘之可能、於下一代法國人民之影響、將不堪設想、或將與一九二八年之俄國情形相彷彿</p>
<p>民生疾苦達於極點</p>
<p>渠所見之悲劇、較之政治與軍事之崩潰、更為可怕、現面帶菜色之兒童、遍地皆是、因缺乏營養而患病者、亦為數甚衆、在未淪陷區域內、牛油與肉類、巳無法獲得、政府對成人計口授糧、每日僅有麵包二片、肉類則每星期僅發一次、普遍家庭、每日午晚二餐、均以靑菜佐膳、早餐則僅有菜湯而已、</p>
<p>一致熱望英國勝利</p>
<p>除維希政府官昌外、法國人民之政治生活、由於飢饉與戰敗、已不復存在、但就其政治之思想而言、則現有二派、勢力相埒、一親英、其口號為「但願吾人之友英國獲勝」、一反英、其口號為「但願可恨之英國獲勝」、</p>
<p>貝當上將深孚衆望</p>
<p>在自由法國區域內、貝當上將、深孚衆望、一般人皆深信渠雖年邁、但在德人壓力下、主持維希政府、除貝當上將外、似無更適當之人物以賴伐爾聲望未著、恐不能達成其欲為領袖之目的、法國人民中巳不見有集權陣綫之靑年運動、即德人之宣傳活動、亦已絕跡、</p>
<p>人民渴求國外消息</p>
<p>法國國內失業者甚為普遍、惟年輕者大多被迫加入「靑年營」為政府築路、或從事於其他公用事業之工作、法人聽有關於外界之消息、均得自政府管理之無錢電台及報紙、但對閱讀瑞士報紙、並不禁止、凡私人收聽英國廣播者、官方亦無明文禁止、故凡有收音機而熟諳英語之法人、均得收聽之、</p>
<p>英僑在法頗受優待</p>
<p>現法國肯尼斯地方、仍有不少英僑、彼等無法向英國匯寄款項、但法國之旅舍主人或二房東、頗願仟彼等拖欠膳宿等費、直至戰爭結束後、再作計較、法國境內猶太人亦不少、彼等頗富有、而維希政府在納粹壓力下所宣佈之反猶法律、亦不十分嚴厲、</p>
<p>反義情緒高於一切</p>
<p>法國人民、均無反猶情緖、蓋法人所最痛恨者、僅德義兩國而已、但法人之憎恨義大利人、更甚於德國人、法人認為德國尙屬明槍交戰、而義大利人則暗箭傷人也、目下法國人民、因缺乏汽油、故用脚踏車代步、即以前之汽車階級、今亦不得小改乘自由車矣、</p>

<h3>蠶絲雜俎</h3>
<p>— 大予</p>
<p>（一）華絲在美比重高增</p>
<p>近三年的美國蠶絲消費，在總量上是趨向萎縮的，然而華絲的比重却年見增加，這是由於國際情感的變遷而蒙其惠，誠是可喜的現象。然而，相反的，近三年來上海生絲出口商英美洋行的貿易减退，日商洋行貿易比重的增加，也是一個事實。茲將二十七年至二十九年美國生絲市塲的輸入統計，摘其扼要如下：</p>
<p>上海蠶絲自受「貨物移動禁令」之束縛後，英美輸出商更陷於窮境，目下欲得出口者須和日本銀行連絡滙兌，故生絲之輸出，日商巳成獨佔姿態。惟輸入美國後，又必須轉賣與在紐的之上海洋商代理人，故在美國市塲上之中日生絲對立問題，依然如故。</p>
<p>（二）華中公司之鱗爪</p>
<p>民國二十七年叫月，華中蠶絲組合以蘇州無錫等地九家絲廠二千二百台繅絲機為基礎，開始繅製生絲。同年八月十日正式宣吿成立。為「華中絲業之一元化之統制機關」。資本為八百萬元。中國人方面以現物資本二百萬元，日本方面以現金三百萬元為資本，至翌年三月父擴張事業，增加資本，仍由華中振興公司投資。</p>
<p>華中之蠶絲事業，包括機械繅絲，製造配給蠶種等，悉在華中公司統制之下，至二十九年四目繅絲廠巳增至二十一所，繅絲機已達七千五百台，使用人員一萬七千餘人，產絲量達到三萬八千担。</p>
<p>關於製種方面，亦由彼獨佔。計民國二十七年春供給百分之二十，秋季供給百分之七十五，二十八年後已佔其令部。關於收繭，二十八年春問經過原有之繭行，以訂的方法向各處牧買，共購入二十萬担，同年秋繭，計收購六萬担，此外又收購乾繭八萬六千九百担，至二十九年共購入春秋繭計十三萬担。</p>
<p>（三）通貨問題與統制</p>
<p>華中蠶絲百分之七十以上，巳全入統制之手，但由於通貨問題之複雜，使統制發生苦悶。據日本遠東貿易月刊稱：—「（上略）通貨問題，頗屬難關，租界及產繭地均要求法幣，然於日軍佔領區域內有軍用票流通，買易通貨則為華興券，故華中蠶絲公司之經營事業，頗感棘手；最初借入之華興券隨法幣而跌落，後訂作六辦士，結果發生五百數十萬兀之滙兌差損……」</p>
<p>五百數十萬元之滙兌差損，不能說是太小的苦悶。故自二十八年年終，華中蠶絲公司與出口商之間，即以美金定價，後來更進一步以美金賣買，故他們說：「故今日通貨問題之解決，實為燃眉之急。」</p>
<p>（四）兩派意見的謎</p>
<p>年來美國生絲消費之萎縮，恐怕將隨時局的緊張而更縮小。這使中日生絲在美的衝突，更形激化。這一相持不下的矛盾，巳使日本的蠶絲常局覺得焦慮。因為如果要維持華中蠶絲公司之成立，那必須採取提高技術增加半產的道路，而這一點，却會打擊了美國巿塲上的日絲。由於此，他們生出了兩派意見，第一派屬於投資華中蠶絲公司及經營輸出業者，都主張養蠶製絲等輕工業，應當委託生產費用低廉之中國地方担任。日本應當專門轉向重工業。而另一派在朝者，則主張「第一步將匡正日本絲業之全面的依存於輸出，如須移重點於中國，則須另求方策以解決輸出市塲之問題」云云。</p>
<p>然而，這些正的反的意見，反正都是絲業的難關。何况太平洋的風雲又日益險惡呢。至於究竟如何，吾人且拭目以待之吧！</p>
<p>（五）華北也在提倡養蠶</p>
<p>據臨楡縣友人的消息，臨楡興楡蠶林公司，年來積極提倡養蠶，在臨楡·灤縣·盧龍一帶，推廣成效頗可人意。大部農尸已感覺興趣，所以前途似有普遍希望。近悉該公司於本年度更擬擴大養蠶區域，除「冀東道」所屬各縣仍照常配給改良蠶種外，並在北平設立興楡蠶林絲廠，兼營改良蠶種之免費發給。値此蠶繭發育之期，聽聞本年巳預計配給家蠶與山蠶種十八萬張云。</p>
<h3>經濟禁谈</h3>
<p>— 馮柳瑩</p>
<p>物價統計</p>
<p>統計之為學，中國所不講，統計之事實，則嘗散見於諸書中，惟不明顯昭著耳。</p>
<p>中國通常所謂計，最著者莫若會計。帳冊中所習見者，從數値言，有小計，共計，總計，累計，分計，從時問言，則有日計，月計，歲計。至統計二字，在今雖似成為一學術名詞，然其形式固從總計嬗變而來。惟總之義，但就數字彙加而總結之：統則含有由分治而統一之義，故與Statistic之文義若相近。</p>
<p>中國統計之作，僅有海關貿易冊，就進出口貨量値之變遷，及各關貨物吐納之盈虛，稅收之增减，以為統計。雖亦有量Quantity値Value分列，但所謂Value者，只為貨物價値之總和，而非各個之價格Price，雖亦不難從量値，求得價格，亦只為一年來平均價格Average，仍無從知其趨勢變遷耳。</p>
<p>中國未始不重各地貨價調査，管子言之，桑弘羊劉宴輩實行仃之。即至淸光諸問，屢遭　　，知商務之常興，千頭萬緖，要非準備不為功。甲午（一八九四年）一役之後，新敗於日，言新政者漸多，如光緖二十一年（一八九五年）戶部議復御史王鵬運議設商務局摺內，亦知注重各地物價調査矣。其言曰：</p>
<p>「該御史謂於各省設立商務局，俾得維護華商，漸收利權，誠為當務之急。惟請派設專員，作為提調，以官府之體，而親　　之業，終難透闢。不如官為設局，仍聽商辦以聯其情。擬請飭下各督撫於省會設立商務局，由各商公舉一殷實穩練素有聲望之紳商，派充局董，駐局辦事。將該省物產行情，綜其損益，逐細講求。其與洋商關涉者，絲茶為大宗，近則織布，紡紗，製糖，造紙，自來火（按即火柴）洋胰子，諸業，考其利病，何者可以敵洋商，何者可以廣銷路，如能實有見地，確有把握，准其經禀督撫為之提倡。再由各府州縣於水陸通衢，設立通商公所，各舉分董，以聯指臂。所有各　處物產價値漲落，市面消長盈虛，即由各分董按季具報省局，彙總　　，仿照總稅務司貿易總冊式樣，年終山督撫資送總理衙門，以供參考。」</p>
<p>按商務總局，即後之總商會前身，然其時乃由官派，如光諸二十五年兩江總督劉坤一派張賽劉世珩馳赴上海設局，但亦無所成就。光緖三十四年九月令各省設立調査局，各部院總其成，設立統計處，具文而已。民國肇建，統計調査，未嘗不舉辦，亦皆羗無實際。至民國八年起，中國始有正式之調查物價機關，然仍為海關徵收進口稅而起。按中國微收洋貨進口稅，本以粵海關為正宗，在五口通商前，年的八十九萬九千餘兩，當時稅則之高低，本有自中之權。惟是進口之貨，大的為鴉片呢絨疋頭鐘表之類，出口之貨，絲茶大黃之屬；稅目簡單。及後五口通商，洋十貨進出並無限制，貨品愈繁，花色愈多，有為舊時稅則所無者，一任關吏上下其手，因緣為奸，非勾結洋商，於中侵肥，即暴征橫歛，婪索無饜；旣虧稅課，亦且病商。自與各國訂立商的，遂開協定稅則之門，於是權不我操，洋貨之輸人大為便利矣。洋貨本欲推銷於中國，利於稅重，及稅則一經與洋人協定，彼為自身利益計，必擇貨價之有利於己者（即貨價低）以為課稅之準則，果如是，則中國之稅收，父無形减色矣。於是貨價之高低，往往成為聚訟之焦點。以中國平時無物價調查之報吿，所採用之貨價，非取之於關冊量値相除所得之價格，即臨時向市上調查，或求之於洋行，是皆未可取以爲信，亦屬事之無可如何池。及民國七年修訂進口稅則，蔡廷幹主其事，歸言於財政部，以平時無貨價調查，修訂稅則時非但不便，且多損失，於是有在滬設處調查貨價之議。民國八年一月，財政部乃派盛俊曁郭桑嚴家灼設立駐滬調査貨價處，其後又加派賈士毅，而由盛俊主持之。盛為學者，故遇事皆以學者態度出之，調査貨價處能有後來之成績，皆其一手經營之力也。</p>
<p>貨價調查處成立之初，因陋就簡，時郭桑為上海印花處處長，設局於十六舖，貨價處即僦其餘屋辦公。其後又遷於白克路侯在里，三遷於紗布交易所六樓，至遷入江海關二樓，蓋已在改組為國定稅則委員會之後矣。</p>
<p>其時工商界，對於部派調査貨價，非但不與贊助，且暗有歧視，陽則勉强敷衍，陰則置之腦後，蓋其心目中，以為官廳辦事，有始無終，只要搪塞過去，便可了事。况其調査貨價，必為加稅起見，我商界之底蘊為所悉，尙有何生意可做，故以蘊瞞欺矇為上策。惟其中獨知調查貨價之重要而竭誠襄贊者，僅五洲藥房項松茂及疋頭業顧子槃二人而巳！</p>
<p>然以數千百種之貨價，得一二人之協助，及三四人之調査，非徒簡陋可知，抑亦勞而無功，乃於部派員之外，加延潘忠甲郭枬分任調查事。復羅致當業中人，報吿市債貨價，名之曰調查員。時為之調查員者，雖係各業中人，亦不敢公然担仟，懼為店中人所悉受責也。蓋工商界積習猶深，行巿大小，每不欲公開，惟恐一經宣露，有不利於其「吃盤」或種種「做手」也。</p>
<p>民國八九年時之工商界從業人員，自不如目前靑年從業昌所受敎育之多（要知讀書未必能發財，發財未必能讀書，此在二十年前之上海工商界更甚，）及要下筆寫市情報吿，不覺有千鈞之重。故當時每一業調査員之成就，大都經過相當時　的訓練。（未完）</p>

<h3>陷穽</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>此次歐戰，是英德的生死存亡所繫，所以雙方莫不詭計多端，爭奇鬭勝。其中有一法，就是在退出一地之前，佈置「陷穽」，使敵方大上其當。</p>
<p>比如有一間秋毫未損的屋子，花園裹的小徑當中放着一盆水，你把水盆提起，轟隆一聲，有顆地雷爆炸起來；一屋裹壁上有一個鏡框掛得歪歪斜斜地。你走上去把它放正，又是　隆一聲；你開無綫　，坐椅子，生火爐，關窗……無論做甚麼事，都有上敵人的大當的危險。有時候甚至長在樹上的鮮細可愛的蘋菓，也是敵人所佈下的「陷穽」之一，因為蘋菓中生有毒汁啦。</p>
<p>其實佈滿陷穽的，豈僅軍隊的征途？崎嶇的世途中也何嘗不是如此？允其是在這燈紅酒綠，紙醉金迷的繫華都巿中，更是到處陷穽，人生途上的靑年，更不可不謹愼啊</p>

<h3>植物的拓地戰略</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>我們知道『傳種，』是生物界一條比『維持一己生命』還要重要的公律。然而為植物却有一個附帶的先決條件：就是不要把種子聚攏在一起，以致它們此擁彼擠，缺乏必需的營養料而不能充分發育。所以必須把它們分散開去，必須用侵略的手叚去拓地！現在我們來看看大自然賦給植物的幾種拓地的戰術。</p>
<p>凌空</p>
<p>戰術中沒有比空軍更利害更有效能的了，而大自然賦給植物種子的拓地能力呢，也以征空利器為最多。你看那楡錢椿牌的薄翅，蒲公英剪刀股的圓傘，楊花的隨風飄舉，柳絮的凌雲直上，還有許許多多不勝縷述的東西：說它們是飛機也好，說它們是降落傘也好，那一個不是英勇傑出所向無敵的空中戰士呢？</p>
<p>跨海</p>
<p>有些植物的種子，外面包圍着一層殼，本身就像一隻小船或潛艇，所以能够隨波逐流，『乘長風破萬里浪！』有人在南洋羣島的海灘上，拾得一隻重量二十五公斤的椰子，調查後，知道是從非洲馬達加斯加島東北的一座島飄來的。又有人算計了從巴拿馬地　冲向太平洋中加拉拍哥斯羣島的一股海流，共挾帶了大陸上的植物一百四十四極。凡海洋上亙古沒有人到的海島，所以也能有植物繁殖，大概全是這樣來的。</p>
<p>機槍</p>
<p>生在地中海沿岸和非洲北部的一種奇異的葫蘆科植物，名叫「噴瓜」當它的果實成熟時，便自動的脫離果柄（正是古語的所謂瓜熟蒂落），父由於它自身所潛藏的一種不可遏抑的高壓力，能够把種子從『蒂孔』那裹射擊到很遠的地方，這不是一架維妙維肖的機關槍嗎？</p>
<p>炸彈</p>
<p>果實能够作『炸彈』式爆裂的植物，還有我們人人所習見的鳳仙花。鳳仙花的果實為長圓形，成熟時，果皮便裂成五瓣，柞急劇的盤捲，把種子彈射到四方：歐洲人稱這種花為『暴燥花』或「不可觸動花，」大可以表明它那炸彈式的脾氣哩！</p>
<p>掃射</p>
<p>罌粟的果實，像一隻帶　的小罐子。種子成熟時，蓋下周圍便張開一行排列勻整的圓洞；風一吹來，小罐子便搖曳着把種子從圓洞裏向四方揮散。我們勉强稱這種散播種子的方式為掃射吧。</p>
<p>隧道</p>
<p>竹，甘蔗，白茅，節節草，—叉名斷腸草—還有無數旁的植物，它們的拓地方法，是用地下根或莖往各處橫衝直撞，亂鑽一氣。把這種『鑽』的工夫，比作掘隧道的動作，大概還有幾分相似吧。</p>
<p>利誘</p>
<p>凡是含漿汁帶肉　的果實，大概是不會自乾坼把種子散播到外面去的：大自然於是把它們的容貌修飾的非常美麗，汁　製造的非常甘甜，好讓人和動物見而欲羨，朶頥染指；至於種子呢，却又故意把它們弄的苦澀生硬，不堪下嚥，好叫人和動物不說不擲而棄之，掉頭不顧。可是植物拓地的慾望呢，却藉着這一取一棄而完全滿足了。這，名之曰『利誘』，孰云不宜</p>
<p>無賴</p>
<p>生在山溝路旁的一種惡草，叫『豬殃，』它的果實上長着無救小鈎；另有一種惡草叫『野刺猬，』它的果實橢圓而滿圍着尖刺，彷彿是刺猬這兩種則西，全能當着人和動物在它們身旁走過時，硬攀附在人的衣服或獸的毛尾上，叫人和獸白盡義務的替它們作拓地的先鋒。這種揩油式的完成侵略的手叚，無以名之，名曰『無賴』</p>

<p>這段奇異的事蹟引起了科學家的好奇心，丹維爾大學的人類學家辛格敎授認為這是研究環境影響心理發展的一决極好的試騐。他向史那處搜集關於狼女的種種事實，加以透澈的分析和整理，最近並已輯成專書。在書中有幾段是很耐人尋味的，現在摘錄於下：</p>
<p>「雖然一個嬰孩從遺傳上得着完全的人性，但是因為人類的神經系統組織太複離了，他的早年必須有人類環境多方面的接觸，吾則就不能發展成健全的心理。」</p>
<p>「一個嬰兒在最初兩年中所學習到的性格和慣技影響極大，差不多要等於一生其餘時間中學習的所得，因此在頭兩年中倘若沒有跟人類相接觸，他的言語的技能和直立的姿態就不容易恢復了。」</p>
<p>「環境的影響力究竟不是面面俱到的，一頭幼年的狼或猿猴倘若被帶到孤兒院中與人共處，結果因為天生的下等坯子，牠們對人類的行為並不能學習得到多少。」</p>

<p>玉崑無論怎樣的歡喜說笑詁，一聽趙四這一篇報吿，也不由驀地變了臉色，什麼話都說不出來了。</p>
<p>「他們是怎麼知道的？」他呻吟了好一會，才向趙四這樣問。</p>
<p>趙四因為長得太胖的緣故，儘管一路不停的揮扇，臉上和身上的汗，還像珍珠泉一樣的骨嘟嘟地冒出來。</p>
<p>「這就是季兆雄那個小子弄的鬼戲啊！」</p>
<p>玉崑不很明瞭地向他看了一眼。</p>
<p>「讓我慢慢告訴你吧！」趙四先把一條浸透了冷水的毛巾在臉上用力抹了一陣，然後氣喘如牛地說：「初七那天晚上，向來在天津袁公館裏當馬弁的那個季兆雄，忽然一個人闖到了這兒來，先是亂七八糟的跟我們敷衍了一陣，後來就把榮奎那小子單獨的了出天；第二天，榮奎和金大個子兩個人，便鬼鬼祟祟的商議了大半天，我湊巧有些事出去了一會，回來之後，也不曾怎樣注意。不料他們早就不存好心，幾個人不知道拼湊了多少錢，買來許多酒和我平日愛吃的東西；二老板，這一層的確是我趙四的短處，一生愛吃喝……！」他那滾圓的胖臉上，立刻就透出了很內愧的神氣，充分表示着引咎自責的意思。（一二〇）</p>

<p>有一天，白雷馬請敎蘇聯名導演史丹尼斯拉夫斯基，問他怎樣選擇他的那些演員？史氏就拿起一隻別針來說：「我就憑這個來挑選他們的。」隨後史氏又對白雷馬說：「現在請你先到隔壁房間裏去稍待一會兒吧。」</p>
<p>白雷馬出去不久，史丹尼斯拉夫斯基就開口說：「好了，現在你可以進來了。你來我我那隻別針看！」一面冷眼旁親看白雷馬的一舉一動。</p>
<p>那時白雷馬先從桌子上拿起幾隻玻璃杯；又翻了翻碟千，和盆子，希望可以在那些東西下面我釗別針。忽然白雷馬感到檯布底下好像有着什麽東西似的，果然他掀起了檯布角，就立刻發現了別針。</p>
<p>史氏拍手大叫：「好極了，你眞能幹呀！」以下就是他的解釋：「我能從一個人怎樣找別針的姿態，來確定他是否好演員，假如他在屋子四週踱了一圈，顯出手足無措的模樣，還假裝着深思遠慮的　色，到幾處好笑的（虛張響勢的）地方去東倒曲翻，那麼他一定是個不中用的傢伙了。」</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Hull's Statement: No Change in Policy Towards Japan; Will Assist China's War Effort with More Supplies; Matsuoka Claims Japan Will Continue to Adhere to the Axis</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that there has been no change in U.S. policy towards Japan. Hull's statement came during a press conference in response to questions about President Roosevelt's avoidance of mentioning Japan in his speech on Tuesday, as the President believes that Japanese businessmen will eventually rise up against Japan's military leadership. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt's speech on Tuesday repeatedly mentioned and criticized Hitler, but hardly mentioned Japan, leading to rumors here that the President was trying to appease Japan in an attempt to persuade it to leave the Axis. Unattributed remarks from Congress, circulated everywhere, further suggested the truth of these rumors. Therefore, when Secretary of State Hull met with journalists yesterday afternoon, many inquired about this. However, Hull only responded that there was no change in U.S. policy towards Japan. However, it is not difficult to explain the aforementioned rumors. It appears that the rumors originated in Oregon, which is known for being sympathetic to Japan, just as California is known for being anti-Japanese. Japan is Oregon's best customer, which explains the origin of the rumors. Examining Hull's statement that the U.S. has not changed its policy towards Japan, the U.S. still views Japan as part of the entire Axis, and therefore considers Japan's policies, like those of Germany and Italy, to be based on hostility towards the U.S. Washington is currently filled with rumors about the possibility of peace talks between Chongqing and Tokyo, but responsible parties have not only not confirmed this, but also indicated that they will provide more assistance to China to aid its war effort against a part of the Axis. However, the arrival of this assistance in China will be slightly slower than its arrival in Britain. China is currently tying down Japan, preventing its army from being used elsewhere, and the Japanese army seems incapable of penetrating deep into China or forcing China to submit. In Europe, Britain urgently needs assistance to contain the Axis in Europe, which is why U.S. supplies are being prioritized for Britain. Once assistance to Britain increases slightly, U.S. supplies to China via the Pacific will greatly increase, unlike the current slow pace. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Officials at the Export Control Board confirmed that the government is not currently considering changing any existing regulations regarding the control of the export of key defense materials to Japan, including gasoline. President Roosevelt stated at a press conference on Wednesday that the U.S. will not consider any further control of kerosene exports to Japan, other than the export control procedures currently in place. Before President Roosevelt made this statement, reliable sources claimed that the President deliberately did not mention Japan in his fireside chat because he did not want to offend those who could actually change Japan's national policy, such as Japanese businessmen. This is the first clear indication of the administration's hope that Japan will distance itself from the Axis. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese officials declared that Matsuoka reiterated today that the Tripartite Pact is the unchangeable foundation of Japan's foreign policy and that Japan will abide by the Tripartite Pact. Matsuoka made these remarks to counter the U.S. attempt to separate Japan from the Axis. Matsuoka said that this information was based on misleading news and was intentionally spread. When Matsuoka strongly stated that Japan would continue to adhere to the Axis, he said, "Based on the statements made by Prime Minister Konoe and myself in the past, and the subsequent evolution of Japanese policy, everyone should understand this." Matsuoka also said that Japan's southward advance policy is a peaceful process, but if international developments make this policy impossible, Japan may have to reconsider its attitude according to changing circumstances. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Ott Visits Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>TOKYO - German Ambassador to Japan Ott visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to discuss President Roosevelt's speech, which proves that Germany is deeply concerned that the speech may affect Japanese public opinion. A government spokesperson told foreign reporters today that the German ambassador's visit to the Foreign Minister was for this purpose. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>British, American, and Canadian Teams Jointly Organize Relief Team to China</h3>
<p>NEW YORK - The American Friends Service Committee announced yesterday that it has sent a rescue team composed of British, American, and Canadian members to China to provide relief to civilians wounded by Japanese bombing along the Yunnan-Burma Road. The team consists of 50 members, 10 ambulances, and mobile operating rooms with sterilization equipment, generators, and X-ray equipment. The team leader is Canadian surgeon Dr. McLaurin, who has served as a doctor at a church in Central China for 10 years and is a member of the International Red Cross. The British team members have already departed for Rangoon, while the American and Canadian team members will depart for China within a week. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Discusses World Situation; Attacks Dutch East Indies Government</h3>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese spokespersons and newspapers yesterday attacked the Dutch East Indies government, saying it "completely relies on Britain and the United States." At the same time, Prime Minister Konoe is meeting with Japanese government advisors and key cabinet members at his private residence. The main topic is the world situation related to President Roosevelt's speech. After the meeting, Japanese government officials and advisors, as well as naval and army leaders, consulted for a long time. Newspapers here are generally moderate in tone, but the "Hochi Shimbun" criticized Roosevelt's mention of China, saying, "The U.S. has now openly declared its hostility towards Japan and has forced Japan to remove this hostility." (International News Service, 30th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative of the Stabilization Fund, Fox, Arrives in Honolulu; Reportedly Seeks Closer Cooperation Between China, Britain, and the U.S.; Johnson Submits Favorable Report on China's War Effort</h3>
<p>HONOLULU - Fox, the U.S. representative of the Chinese Stabilization Fund Committee, arrived here yesterday en route to Chongqing aboard a clipper. It is said that while the initial purpose of the Stabilization Fund Committee was to stabilize the Chinese currency, its realistic goal is to seek further close cooperation between China, Britain, and the U.S. He stated that the committee hopes to assist China in developing its foreign trade with material resources and should be an important factor in China's reconstruction process. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Hull stated here yesterday that former U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson has submitted a favorable report to the State Department regarding China's war effort. When asked what Johnson's report covered, Hull replied that he believed "newspapers would not obtain any unfavorable news from Johnson." Johnson's vacancy will be filled by Ambassador Gauss, and Johnson himself will soon succeed Gauss as the U.S. Minister to Australia. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Twenty-Eight American Ships Carrying War Materials Sunk</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - According to confirmed reports received by members of Congress, only twenty-eight ships carrying war materials from various U.S. ports to Britain have been sunk since the outbreak of war. It is said that the above list does not include ships carrying U.S. goods loaded in Canada. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Tests World's Largest Bomber in Southern California</h3>
<p>LOS ANGELES - Yesterday, troops in key areas of Southern California, accompanied by anti-aircraft artillery, traveled in multiple trucks to city airports, Lockheed Air Terminal, Burbank, Clover Field, Santa Monica. It is assumed the U.S. Army wants to heavily guard the above key areas when testing the world's largest bomber. After anti-aircraft artillery units were dispatched to major aircraft factories, army detachments immediately entered. Naval and marine patrols are stationed at the Port of Los Angeles. The bomber test will be held at the Douglas Aircraft Factory. Clover Field is adjacent to the factory, and security has been increased along the old Terminal Island wharf to "prevent interference."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Help the Impoverished Masses</h3>
<p>Since the prices of all goods have soared, general living conditions have been severely impacted. Regardless of whether it is [the impact] or not, social welfare and charitable endeavors, such as caring for orphans and the elderly, aiding the disabled, providing medical care and medicine, cooking porridge for disaster relief, and covering burials, are all facing the risk of insufficient funding and a lack of provisions. The original funds were only sufficient for regular expenses. Now that everything is extraordinary, where can this extraordinary funding come from to provide support? Thus, to compensate for what has been exhausted, assistance is repeatedly called for, relying on the help of enthusiastic members of society. This is, of course, the inevitable outcome. However, as the pressure of life deepens, the masses waiting for relief increase. Just as illness cannot be avoided, the cost of medicine is beyond the means of the average person, leading crowds to flock to places providing medical care and medicine. Hunger cannot be endured, with rice costing thousands of cash units per measure, prompting people to travel ten or twenty miles early in the morning to beg for food from porridge distribution sites in the north and south. Devastated by war, there are orphans, widows, the elderly without support, and the young without guardians, wandering and displaced, falling into ditches and ravines, overwhelming the capacity to care for them. Moreover, the roads are filled with starving corpses, and burials are constantly taking place, filling the leaky grounds. This also involves public health, which cannot be interrupted even for a moment. Considering these points, which are not the pleas of the helpless masses, and which are not unbearable to human compassion? Those who willingly degenerate and wander the streets are, of course, pests of society, and it would not be an exaggeration to let them live or die on their own. However, those with a compassionate heart still feel a sense of pity and do not hesitate to provide assistance. For those whose misfortunes are not self-inflicted, whose circumstances are unavoidable, who are sinking in the same sea of suffering, where else can they turn? Can one remain unmoved? Can one refuse to provide assistance? If so, then society is cold-hearted and the masses are left uncared for, which is not what Shanghai society is about. Consider the New Universal Relief Home, which quickly raised 100,000 yuan for provisions. The work of the Tushanwan Orphanage, just disclosed in this newspaper, has already seen a continuous stream of donations. Similarly, the porridge kitchens of the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Hall, the Charity Alliance, and the Jisheng Association, as well as other groups providing free meals, medicine, and burials, have all received enthusiastic support from various sectors of society. These reports never cease to arrive, showing that Shanghai people are not lacking in those who find "the greatest joy in doing good," and that this is a ray of hope in the midst of the financial exhaustion of various public welfare and charitable undertakings.</p>
<p>However, public welfare and charity are beautiful names. As a result, there are those who steal their names for beauty, and charity has actually become a "household" name, with charity as a profession. Those who call themselves such are shameless, and those who receive their assistance are unashamed. Both are truly lost. Relief is, in fact, an obligation that humanity should have. In Chinese ethical and moral concepts, starting from familial love and benevolence, extending to clans, relatives, society, and the nation, helping those in need and relieving poverty is seen as a matter of course. Everyone should have this in mind, but not everyone can fulfill this duty. Thus, those who have money but cannot provide labor fulfill their obligation by donating money; those who have labor but no money to donate fulfill their obligation by providing labor; and those who can donate both money and labor donate both. They are simply fulfilling what they should fulfill and doing what they should do. Therefore, to boast and congratulate oneself for handling charitable work, claiming it as one's own achievement, is no different from claiming the merits of heaven. What could be more ominous? If one handles charitable work to create a reputation and gain a position, then how is that different from treating it as a gateway to success, a shortcut to advancement? Is that the original intention of the undertaking? As for those who have other intentions and use the name of charity as a guise, they are even lower and not worth mentioning. This is not that we are deliberately being harsh. It is simply that people's hearts differ as much as their faces, and it is not difficult to find good and bad mixed together. One must know that handling public welfare and charitable work, entrusted by the public to achieve relief, is not just like rescuing someone from a fire or drowning, allowing no delay. It requires thinking about every penny and every item, regardless of whether it comes from public or private sources, as the crystallization of effort and dedication. How should one understand this intention, considering the difficulty of obtaining resources and the ease with which they can be misused, in order to ensure that funds are not wasted and that relief is delivered effectively? This is the duty of those involved in disaster relief. It is not just that people hope to be rescued through charitable acts. If the handling is not careful and the name does not match the reality, then those who were originally intended to be rescued may instead be severely harmed, and those who were originally intended to be saved may instead be killed. Therefore, if the work is not handled by the right people, it will not only be a waste of resources and a source of abuse, but also a mess, often achieving the opposite effect. For urgent disaster relief efforts, such as those caused by floods, fires, or war, which arise suddenly and require temporary measures, only those with ample disaster relief experience can handle them. If one intends to engage in public welfare and charitable work, one must only know the public good and not consider personal gain, dedicating oneself wholeheartedly. Even employed personnel, who are partly volunteering, must have a deep interest in disaster relief, and not just see it as a place to earn a living. If one always thinks of relief funds and goods as coming from those who need to be rescued, then one should strive for fairness in distribution, thoroughness in preservation, and practicality in operations, never betraying the intentions of those who provide the relief. This is also the responsibility of those involved in disaster relief. Therefore, the key to disaster relief lies in finding the right people, and what is meant by finding the right people is simply finding those who can be sincere and dedicated! If everyone harbors a sense of caution, as if treading on thin ice over a deep abyss, thinking that any mistake will bring guilt upon oneself, then one will certainly not dare to embezzle even a penny, seek out the right people for the job, and not dare to act rashly. Those who receive relief will all benefit, and the good deed will be accomplished.</p>
<p>However, while disaster relief should be handled in this way, it must rely on the assistance of members of society in order to proceed without fear of being abandoned halfway, and to handle matters with dedication and focus. One should not think that this is only the responsibility of charitable organizations and stand by idly. Nor should one worry that the money and goods donated will be embezzled by those handling them and withhold one's support. One must know that, from the standpoint of donating, one should be concerned about the suffering of the masses and not question the character of a few individuals. One should only ask whether the relief is what one urgently needs and whether the donation is one's due responsibility! If it is one's responsibility, then one should not have the idea that one is giving to others, nor should one think that others are receiving from oneself. One should not even think about how the donated items will be handled, but simply do what one's heart feels at ease with and what one can do. If there is anything that is not done thoroughly or honestly, that is the fault of those handling the relief. However, those handling the relief may not all be famous, and those who are famous may not all be genuine. Therefore, in order to make donations more effective and impactful, one should understand the performance of the work one intends to donate to before donating. If it is good, then one should offer assistance without being asked, allowing those who do good deeds wholeheartedly without seeking recognition to know that the truth is out there, and members of society will have a fair judgment, knowing what to encourage and becoming more motivated. Today, various undertakings are hindered by rising prices, suffering from financial difficulties, and the number of those waiting for relief is even greater than in the past. It is truly a time for all sectors to work together to maintain [these undertakings]. However, one should not be ashamed of donating small amounts, thinking that they are insignificant, and therefore not donate. One must know that a pagoda is built by gathering sand, and it all comes from tiny particles. As long as one does what one can to the best of one's ability. One should not be indifferent to relieving the poor and impoverished because one is wealthy and well-off, thinking that it has nothing to do with oneself. One must know that the world is impermanent, people's hearts are unpredictable, and no one can guarantee that they will not fall from grace. Why not plant good roots in times of prosperity to avoid being reproached for being rich and unkind? As the hot summer is approaching, medical undertakings are particularly important. Existing medical care and medicine provision programs, especially those with a proven track record, should be maintained by the power of the masses, or even expanded, to meet the urgent needs of the summer season. However, one must carefully select medicines, prioritizing human life and not using relief as a pretext, only seeking to have the appearance of it. People in Shanghai have always been known for their charitable nature, with a deep sympathy for helping the poor and relieving the impoverished. At this critical juncture, they will surely take the initiative to reduce their own desires and expenses in order to establish and maintain social undertakings. This will be more than enough. With the wind rising, one should not treat these words as empty talk.</p>
<h3>U.S. Strengthens Atlantic Fleet to Fulfill President's Promise to Aid Britain; Roosevelt Requests Continued Issuance of Additional Naval Funds; Soviets Believe Britain and the U.S. Will Intensify Cooperation in the Pacific</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - Reliable sources reported yesterday that the United States is engaging in extensive naval activity aimed at strengthening the material power of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in order to fulfill President Roosevelt's pledge to supply raw materials to Britain. Observers also noted that the President mentioned in his fireside chat on Tuesday that the Atlantic Fleet is constantly being strengthened. However, the only source for new ships to reinforce the Atlantic is the Pacific Fleet. The new Atlantic coast is insufficient to accommodate the number of ships required by the "Special Service Fleet." The only American superbattleship currently in the Atlantic suitable for modern warfare is the 35,000-ton "North Carolina," a sister ship to the "Washington," which is currently undergoing sea trials. The "Washington" was recently assigned to service and is currently in the waters off Hawaii, but it cannot sail out until the dredging of the strait off Hawaii is half-completed. It is also known that the "Washington's" sea trial date is scheduled for July. The other three superbattleships in the Atlantic include the newly built aircraft carrier "Wasp" and the "Yorktown." (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to allocate an additional $114,091,080 in naval funds for the current year, including $50 million for the construction of additional air stations and naval equipment, and $150,000 for the construction of an ammunition depot on Oahu Island, Hawaii. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>MOSCOW - The Red Army's newspaper, "Red Star," recently commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that Britain and the U.S. should intensify military cooperation in the Pacific. This can be clearly seen from the U.S. expansion of its naval patrol area, allowing American ships to travel to the Suez Canal via the Pacific and Indian Oceans. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Passes Foreign Vessel Act; Sent to White House for Signature</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - The Senate has now passed legislation allowing the government to take over 80 foreign vessels idle in the U.S. and sent it to the White House for the President's signature. The act stipulates that the government may take over foreign vessels through purchase, confiscation, or lease, but foreign sailors who lose their jobs due to confiscation must be provided with cash or other equivalent treatment. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3>Responding to Roosevelt's Speech, Foreign Secretary Eden Clarifies Britain's War Aims: Reforming Europe Based on Four Freedoms; Germany Will Not Be Allowed to Perpetrate Atrocities Again After the War</h3>
<p>London - Official declaration of Britain's war aims was first made yesterday in a speech by Foreign Secretary Eden. The war aims clarified by Eden include the four freedoms declared in President Roosevelt's speech, with an added condition: that after the war, strict military and political measures must be adopted to prevent Germany from rising again to contend for global dominance. Eden stated, "Regarding the issue of European revival, its solution will necessarily be influenced by the situation elsewhere, such as in the Far East. After the current arduous struggles of China and Japan conclude, various extremely significant problems will inevitably arise, which can only be resolved with the collective assistance of all other nations." Eden continued, "I do not believe Britain will impose harsh and severe conditions. According to the economic cooperation plan, Germany should be a contributor to economic recovery. However, we must never forget that Germany is the most evil perpetrator in Europe. In the past century, it has disrupted peace five times, and we must not allow it to have the capacity to disrupt peace again. Britain's strength lies in seeking freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom from fear, freedom from want (Roosevelt's four freedoms). Britain plans to establish social security, both domestically and abroad. It will stabilize currency, provide for the hungry, prevent unemployment, and prevent price fluctuations. It will cooperate with the United States, overseas dominions, and South America in education. Britain's peace plan will interfere with a nation's internal economy to the least extent possible. But if asked what contribution Germany can make to the world economy, the answer is absolutely none." (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech yesterday at the Lord Mayor's office in London to hundreds of listeners regarding Britain's plan for post-war economic and social reconstruction has instilled new hope in the war-weary people of Europe. This speech is a response to the "New Economic Order of Europe" chanted by the Nazis. Eden explained (1) Germany's plan to reform Europe would only enslave others spiritually and economically. (2) Only Britain and the United States can provide Europe with the food and raw materials it desperately needs. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in London yesterday that President Roosevelt has indicated the path for free nations of the world and accomplished great works of faith and statesmanship. The essence of the President's speech lies in declaring that the existence of free nations ultimately depends on the freedom of the seas. This meaning also applies to the British Empire and has equal force. The President's broadcast is a world event. The President has expressed with his words the firm resolve of the strongest nation on earth. Eden mentioned Iraq, saying that since the Regent of Iraq returned to the country a few days ago, he has received countless expressions of loyalty and support from all parts of the country, and many former friends of Ali Gailani have fled. Therefore, this self-proclaimed dictator will soon be unable to gain a foothold in Iraq. Britain has absolutely no intention of undermining Iraq's independence. The British government also has great sympathy for Syria's desire for independence. Many Arab thinkers want to seek greater unity for the Arab people and expect Britain's assistance in this regard. Britain will definitely respond to such appeals from British friends.</p>
<p>Eden went on to speak about the future of Europe and its spiritual and material reconstruction, saying, "Do not say that we want to restore the chaos of the world." When peace is restored in the future, we should relax wartime financial measures to ensure that international trade can restore its prosperity on the broadest possible basis. We should hope to see the development of an international exchange system, so that the exchange of goods and businesses in this system can obtain capital cooperation. Throughout this transitional period, social security must be the primary objective of our domestic and foreign policies after the war. We are willing to cooperate with others to prevent hunger, monetary disorder, and major fluctuations in the labor market and prices after the armistice. Germany must participate in this matter, but what we must never forget is that Germany is the worst master Europe has ever had. We will ensure that political and military peace terms can prevent the recurrence of German atrocities in the future.</p>
<p>No one can predict when the end of the war will come, but this end will eventually come suddenly, like the operation of a machine, just as the Germans broke the peace without warning. However, when discussing the reconstruction of Europe, we do not ignore the fact that a solution can affect developments elsewhere and be affected by developments elsewhere. Such developments include, for example, the Far East. Eden then stated, "The permanent resolution of the entire continent and internal peace is our sole objective." (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Two Democratic Nations Share the Same Goal</h3>
<p>Washington - Britain has been slow to announce its war aims. It is widely said here that Britain regards winning the war as its top priority, so it has no time for this. Others say that Britain's failure to announce its aims has other intentions. Now, Foreign Secretary Eden has announced Britain's war aims. In the eyes of Americans, the wording and timing are unparalleled. Although what has been received here is understood to be a brief outline of Eden's speech, it has aroused great interest in all sectors and generated the feeling that the two major democratic nations are advancing towards the same goal. Undoubtedly, Eden's words will be welcomed by the American press. There is no official criticism from official circles at present, but it is not difficult to infer that the White House and the State Department are sure to be delighted by these remarks. Eden is a person who would rather sacrifice his position than blindly appease. This place greatly admires him and once wished him to be the ambassador to the United States. Therefore, the fact that this person made this statement is certainly appealing. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Heated Debate Before British Parliament Adjourns</h3>
<p>London - While British Foreign Secretary Eden was speaking in London yesterday, the House of Commons, on the occasion of proposing the Whitsun recess, debated the issue of announcing Britain's post-war aims. The main speaker was Liberal MP Mandell Halifax, who has a broad "post-war reconstruction" plan, advocating the use of the British Commonwealth as a conduit for greater world unity, and said that we should make the German people understand that we do not want to enslave the Germans, just as the Germans want to enslave us. However, we do not want to make peace with Hitler, because holding meetings with untrustworthy villains is of no use. Many people expressed similar sentiments during the debate. Government spokesman Butler briefly summarized Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks to conclude this debate, and said that it would be a great mistake to give the impression that Britain is not fighting for the greatest security at home and throughout the world, nor for the freedom fought for in Europe.

<h3>No Peace Possible Between Britain and Germany</h3>
<p>Washington - British Ambassador to the United States Halifax told the press last night that no matter the scope and amount of American aid, Britain will continue to fight, because there can be no peace with a mad dog.

Therefore, British naval losses are not only greater than those lost in the World War, but also reach one-third of its entire navy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Officers and Soldiers Rescued from the German Battleship Bismarck Become Prisoners of War; Only Three Survivors from the Haught</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced that 150 officers and men rescued from the German battleship "Bismarck" by British warships have become prisoners of war. Other German soldiers were not rescued because of the harassment of German submarines in the vicinity. Only two people were rescued when the British battleship Haught sank, because the ship's ammunition depot exploded extremely rapidly. Water surrounded and killed 1,341 officers and men on board, and there was no time to rescue them. Also, the British destroyer "Marshna" (1,850 tons) was sunk by aircraft while pursuing the "Bismarck." One officer and forty-five sailors are missing. The "Marshna" normally carries 190 officers and men and was built in March 1937. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Report: 23rd to 29th</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Military Affairs Commission released its weekly war report, covering the period from the 23rd to the 29th. A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that during the week, Japanese forces showed signs of activity in various locations, and Chinese forces also launched counterattacks. While it is unclear which event is more significant, both the Chinese people and international observers are closely following the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, allowing readers to gain a complete understanding of the situation. Additional details on other battles will be provided later. The Japanese objective (the 14th Zhongtiao Mountain Sweep Operation): Most of the transportation hubs and lines in Shanxi Province are occupied by the Japanese. However, the major mountainous areas on all sides remain in the hands of Chinese forces. The Zhongtiao Mountain region can be used to threaten the southern section of the Tongpu Railway if advancing, and can rely on the river for self-defense if retreating. The Japanese believe that they cannot tolerate such a threat, so they launched what they call the "Zhongtiao Mountain Sweep Operation." One attempt failed, followed by a second, and then a third. Over the past three years, there have been as many as thirteen attempts, but each time they not only failed to achieve their objectives, but also suffered losses and abandoned equipment before retreating. This has led to frustration and anger. Furthermore, as they are trying to resolve the "China Incident," they are determined to launch the so-called "14th Zhongtiao Mountain Sweep Operation" on a large scale, mobilizing forces from all directions. The situation is as follows: (1)</p>
<p>Pre-war Deployment</p>
<p>The Japanese army began secret preparations for this large-scale invasion of Zhongtiao Mountain in April. At the beginning of April, the Harada Division, stationed in Kaifeng, was transferred to the vicinity of Qinbo. The cavalry brigade from Shangqiu and the Tanaka Division from Xuzhou were also transferred from the Longhai Railway to this area. The Sakurai Division from northern Jiangxi was also transferred from the Longhai Railway to the vicinity of Yangcheng and Qinshui, forming the eastern route army. The Shimizu Division in the Linfen area and the Ikegami Independent Brigade in Taiyuan, as well as the Katayama Independent Mixed Brigade in eastern Jin, were stationed on the Hengling Pass of Jiangxian County, forming the northern route army. The Japanese divisions such as the a certain Independent Mixed Brigade in northern Jin and the Iseki and Ando Divisions in the southeastern Jin and the triangle area of southern Jin were gathered in the areas of Zhangmao Avenue and Xiaxian County, forming the western route army. (2)</p>
<p>Course of the Battle</p>
<p>The various routes began to move on May 7th, using all their strength to attack the Chinese field army. (A) The eastern route advanced westward through Wenxian County and Qinyang County, passing through Mengxian County and Jiyuan County to attack Fengmenkou. (B) The northern route advanced southward from Jiangxian County and Hengling Pass towards Yuanqu. (C) The western route advanced eastward from Xiaxian County and Zhangmao Avenue to attack Wangjiahe, Taichai Village. The northeastern route invaded Dongfeng through Yangcheng, Qinshui and Zhangma of Yicheng. The Chinese army was well prepared and immediately engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese. After strong resistance from the Chinese, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and the Japanese forces failed to achieve their goals. The Japanese then used a large amount of poison gas and relied on the assistance of their superior air force to successively invade areas such as Yuanqu, Fengmenkou, Shaoyuan Town, and Taichai Village. The Chinese troops resisting the northeastern route of the Japanese army have always stood firm on the line from Dongfeng to Baihuacun. After Yuanqu was captured by the Japanese, the Chinese troops on Zhongtiao Mountain were divided into two parts. The troops west of Jiangyuan Avenue are still confronting the Japanese, while the troops east of the Fanse River and in the mountainous area are still firmly entrenched in the mountainous area northeast of Tongxin Town. The Japanese forces in Yuanqu then invaded Shaoyuan Town to the east and joined with the Japanese forces invading Fengmenkou and Wangwu to the west, opening up the Ji-Yuan Avenue and completing the encirclement. They then advanced towards the various troops north of Jiangyuan Avenue. The Chinese forces saw through their intentions and separately moved out of the encirclement and launched a counter-encirclement. Therefore, there have been fierce battles for five days and nights in the northwestern areas of Qinshui and Gaoping recently. The battles around Yangcheng on the west side of Ji-Yuan Avenue are also extremely fierce. A certain unit west of the Jiangxian-Yuan Avenue has also advanced to the area between Wenxi and Xinjiang and is fighting a desperate battle with the Japanese. At present, all routes are progressing as planned and expanding the results of the battle. (3)</p>
<p>Refuting Japanese Claims</p>
<p>In this battle, Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Ueda, the commander of the Japanese regiment, was killed near Taichai Village. At the same time, Chinese Division Commander Wang Jun also died heroically. The death of generals in major wars is not uncommon. However, the Japanese used their usual trick of spreading rumors and made extensive propaganda to the international community, falsely accusing China of suffering heavy losses and losing many generals. These rumors are not worth a smile from those who know the truth, so I have already refuted them earlier. (4)</p>
<p>Final Conclusion</p>
<p>The Japanese objective is to clear the Zhongtiao Mountain area, capture the Chinese field army and annihilate it. In fact, not only has the Chinese field army not been annihilated, but it has also advanced to various areas near Wenxi, Xinjiang, Fushan, and Yicheng. As for the results of the battle, the Japanese headquarters in southern Shanxi said in a telegram on the 22nd that China had abandoned 4,200 corpses and captured 2,000 prisoners. The Nanjing Japanese China Expeditionary Force reported that China had abandoned 35,000 corpses and captured 8,000 prisoners. An Allied telegram from a certain place in Shanxi on the 25th said that China had abandoned more than 1,000 corpses and another 565 people were captured. A telegram from Shanghai on the 27th, according to a Japanese military spokesman, claimed that China had 5,042 deaths, 12,946 prisoners, and an unknown number of injuries. The numbers vary greatly, and they are obviously inconsistent because they are based on fabricated rumors and not on facts. It is natural for there to be deaths and injuries in battle. Even if, as they say, the Chinese side suffered 30,000 casualties, it is estimated that the Japanese also suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Three train cars of scrap steel helmets were transported north on the Tongpu Railway, and more than 2,000 bodies were cremated in Yuncheng and Jiexian in one day. This one point is enough to show the whole picture. In this way, the Japanese desire to complete the "mopping-up plan" in the occupied areas and resolve the so-called "China Incident" is a dream.</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang Chinese Army</p>
<p>After capturing Zhuji City on the 20th, the Chinese army continued to pursue north along the railway, giving the Japanese no chance to breathe. Now the Chinese army has crossed Linpu and Bailutang and is pressing towards Xiaoshan City. At the same time, the important strongholds of Yuyao and Shangyu have also been captured by the Chinese army one after another. A Japanese military spokesman in Shanghai said on the 24th when receiving foreign reporters that this battle in Zhuji can be compared to a snake fighting a pheasant. The Chinese army adopted a crescent-shaped siege tactic, like a snake surrounding the pheasant's body, but the result was that the pheasant spread its wings and flew away. The hesitant and indecisive Japanese army has admitted defeat in eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Southern Hubei</p>
<p>On the 21st, the Japanese army in Tongshan, Henglin Bridge, Ma Bridge, Bai Dun, Jin Niu and other places gathered more than 2,000 troops and advanced towards Shangxia Ni, Xie, Zhangjia Street, and Zhangjiapu. The Chinese army dealt them a heavy blow, and the Japanese failed to achieve their goals. The Japanese then increased their reinforcements to more than 3,000, and the Chinese army launched hammer tactics again, breaking through the Japanese everywhere. As of the 24th, the Chinese and Japanese armies were still fighting fiercely in the Damoshan area.</p>
<p>Eastern Guangdong</p>
<p>After suffering a major defeat by the Chinese army last week, the Japanese army had difficulty establishing a foothold in Huiyang and Boluo. Huiyang City was captured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 21st, and the Japanese were driven out of Boluo City on the evening of the 22nd. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Now the Chinese army is continuing to pursue the Japanese, and Shilong and Danshui are both under heavy attack by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Southern Fujian</p>
<p>The Japanese army trapped in Fuzhou, under pressure from the Chinese army, risked invading the mountains northwest of Fuzhou. On the 23rd and 24th, they engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties all over the mountains and valleys. After reinforcements arrived, they engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army between Baisha and Dahu. The Japanese army suffered even heavier casualties. Now the Chinese army has captured the highlands east of Dahu and is continuing to attack Dahu.</p>
<p>Other Areas</p>
<p>The Japanese army that invaded Leigongtang from Wangjiashan on the Ruiwu Road in northern Jiangxi has been repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army attacking in the Zhuxi area is still fighting the Japanese in the Kang Gu Ping Dongkou area. The Japanese army in northern Hunan, who invaded south of Zhongfang and Taolin, has been heavily attacked by the Chinese army and is currently fighting fiercely in the area north of Dayun Mountain.

<h3>Roosevelt's Speech: Matsuoka Refuses to Comment, Japanese Newspapers Advocate for War Against the US, Saying the Navy is Ready</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Tokyo Japanese newspapers today prominently published Foreign Minister Matsuoka's comments on President Roosevelt's speech, stating, "There is no need for comment." The Asahi Shimbun said that Matsuoka's response to reporters was "concise and meaningful." The Hochi Shimbun claimed that Matsuoka also said, "First, I did not see anything new in this fireside chat. Second, the tone was weaker than before." (30th United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Nichinichi Shimbun criticized the recent formal statement by the government on Japan's enhanced national defense, saying, "Japan has decided to fight any challenging nation and is fully prepared." This comment by the newspaper was in response to the declaration by Colonel Hiraide, head of the Naval Press Section. Hiraide said, "We are absolutely prepared" to deal with any situation. Hiraide's words were published by every Japanese newspaper in Tokyo and indicated with huge headlines that Japan has completed its national defense and has 500 warships and 4,000 aircraft. Hiraide said in a nationwide broadcast that if the United States goes to war with Germany, "the Pacific problem will immediately affect Japan" because of the Tripartite Pact. He also said that if the United States were to go to war with Germany, the former would adopt a "guerrilla" strategy to destroy Japan's "maritime trade and transportation." However, he said that this strategy would not be "seriously conducted, like the European war," and could not be compared to Germany's dealings with Britain. In addition to the responsibilities of the Tripartite Pact, Japan would be forced to engage in a war of self-defense to "overcome the economic pressure of the enemy country." However, "Japan does not necessarily have to force Germany to fight." Hiraide also said that Japan cannot explicitly state in this world situation whether it will participate in the war, but "we are fully prepared" when necessary. The Nichinichi Shimbun's editorial supported this speech, believing that Japan's true desire, although to establish peace in East Asia and the world, is not to disturb the situation in the Pacific, but it is still determined to fight any challenger. This is what the United States should know. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that it is now a matter of time before the United States joins the European war, and this will immediately affect Japan. Japan is bound by the Tripartite Pact and may participate in the war. It also said, "What is gratifying is that Japan now has a well-equipped navy, with the help of a powerful air force, and will never be defeated by any country. The authorities' statement regarding the Japanese navy being prepared to deal with any situation is a reassurance." (30th United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Responsible sources here said that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech has given Japan a respite, but there is considerable concern about what will happen in the future. Before President Roosevelt's speech, the main issue that Japan was considering was whether the country would be forced to join the European war to contain the US threat to Germany. The Japanese government originally intended to keep this issue a secret to a considerable extent to maintain calm in the country. However, it did not know whether President Roosevelt would go to war with Germany or only decide to send warships to escort munitions to supply Britain, so that Japan would have to fulfill Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact and be drawn into the vortex of the European war to meet the demands of Germany and Italy. President Roosevelt's speech did not directly announce the implementation of escort, so the delicate issue that Japan should have resolved was temporarily shelved. As for Japanese public opinion, it generally believes that Roosevelt's speech, in addition to declaring that the country will continue to aid China, avoided stimulating Japan and did not involve the Pacific issue. It can be seen that its focus is on the British issue and temporarily put the Japanese problem behind it to avoid forcing Japan to immediately join Berlin's embrace. It can be seen that Roosevelt's prudent attitude has met Japan's prudent attitude. Although the hostile behavior between the United States and Japan has become increasingly apparent, it has not yet formally broken down. In this way, Foreign Minister Matsuoka should take a diplomatic offensive in both directions in the future, that is, on the one hand, to maintain the current situation with the United States so that Japan can avoid being drawn into the vortex of the world war, and on the other hand, to take advantage of the existing breathing space to resolve the "China Incident." Although President Roosevelt did not make excessive remarks on the current situation, he still made Japan quite uneasy about the future, because the US policy of restoring freedom of the seas is enough to cause a conflict between the US and Germany.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Thailand Surge, Thai Prime Minister's Visit to Japan Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>Bangkok – The Bangkok Chronicle reported that the number of Japanese residents in Thailand is increasing daily. According to current estimates, there are more than 2,000 Japanese residents in Thailand, most of whom are businessmen. Two years ago, there were only 600 Japanese residents in Thailand.

<h3>Japanese-Dutch Negotiations Stalled, Japanese Side Becoming Impatient, Accusing the Dutch East Indies of Lacking Sincerity</h3>
<p>Batavia – According to well-informed sources here, economic talks between the Dutch East Indies and Japan are still ongoing, and there has been no change in the situation. The information published in the Japanese newspapers is obviously due to impatience and is not worth considering. Some time ago, it was clearly stated that the delay in the negotiations was not the fault of the Dutch East Indies authorities. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo – A government spokesman told foreign interviewers today that the insincerity of the Dutch East Indies has brought the economic talks in Batavia to a serious stage. The spokesman said that Japan has asked Britain to mediate the deadlock, but said that it may ask Britain not to interfere. The conversation between British Ambassador Craigie and the Japanese Foreign Minister yesterday only concerned British-Japanese economic matters. The spokesman also said that the Dutch East Indies authorities had promised to ship several types of goods to Japan, but now they have gone back on their word, accusing Japan of shipping them to Germany. In fact, these goods, including oil and rubber, are all used in Japan. When asked if the Dutch East Indies authorities had asked Japan to guarantee not to ship them to Germany, the spokesman replied that he was not sure. He also said that the oil previously agreed upon is still being shipped to Japan, but Japan had requested an increase in the quantity, and the Dutch East Indies authorities initially agreed, but now they have refused. Japan now hopes that they will reconsider their attitude. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Grand Celebration in Hechuan, Aircraft Donation Naming Ceremony, Over 20,000 People from All Walks of Life Attended, Chairman Chiang Also Sent Representatives to Participate</h3>
<p>Hechuan – The Hechuan Aircraft Donation Naming Ceremony Conference was held at the public stadium at 5:00 this morning. The whole city was decorated with flags and banners, which can be called unprecedented in Hechuan. The first salute was fired at 3:00 in the morning, and the second salute was fired at 4:00. Representatives from various agencies and organizations went to the venue, and people from all walks of life actively participated, reaching a total of more than 20,000 people. Chairman Chiang's representative Chen Qingyun, Chairman Zhang's representative Shen Peng, Zheng Yanzhi, factory director of Yufeng Yarn Factory, and Chen Jingqing, the farmer who donated the most money, also attended the meeting. The conference opened at 5:00 in the dim light of dawn. The flag-raising ceremony was held first, and everyone observed three minutes of silence for the air force martyrs and the compatriots who died in the bombing. Shi Zefan, chairman of the conference, gave the opening speech, saying that today is the first anniversary of Hechuan being bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the aircraft donation by the people of Hechuan is of great significance. As a result of the promotion of the one-yuan movement throughout Hechuan County, three aircraft were donated, which is not only unprecedented in Sichuan, but also a model for all parts of the country. This is the greatest honor of the entire Hechuan County, etc. The whole audience applauded enthusiastically. Subsequently, the aircraft donation naming ceremony was held. Three aircraft models of Hechuan, placed in front of the podium, covered with colored chapters, Shi Zefan's wife cut the ribbon, Yuan Xueai, the main committee member of the Aircraft Donation Solicitation Committee, donated the aircraft to the National Government on behalf of the people of the county, and Chen Qingxue accepted it on behalf of the government. Music was played, and the emotions of the whole audience were excited, and the applause continued for several minutes. After the ceremony, Yu, the director of the Micro-Raising Committee, guided the chief Shi Jianqiao to report the fund raising process, which was very detailed. Chen Qingyun, the representative of Chairman Chiang, delivered a speech, offering comfort and encouragement, and said that this year is the year of victory. China today has the most powerful army, and the strengthening of the air force is extremely urgent. It is hoped that the Hechuan aircraft donation will enable the Sichuan Province donation of hundreds of aircraft to be completed as soon as possible, and the whole country will rise up to catch up and imitate the Hechuan spirit, then the final victory will be realized as soon as possible, etc. Subsequently, Shi Jianqiao led the farmer Chen Jingqing to the stage to introduce him to the attendees. At 7:00 in the morning, three Hechuan aircraft flew from a certain place to the sky above Hechuan, flying high and low, performing stunts, and distributing leaflets. After flying around the county for 20 minutes, they flew back to a certain place, and the people cheered and watched them leave. The conference continued, and Wu Zhaotang, acting director of the Scout Training Camp of the Central Training Group, gave a reply before the conference ended. The representatives then visited the school. Hechuan has a grand amusement fair tonight to celebrate the success of the aircraft donation. The representatives of the various agencies and the press who were invited to accompany the capital will return to Chongqing tomorrow. (30th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Amidst Calls for US Entry into the War: The New-Style Infantry's Majestic Bearing</h3>
<p>New York: Although armored forces, dive bombers, and fifth columns are currently in vogue, modern armies still rely on infantry as their backbone. Fifth columns can corrupt the enemy, dive bombers can terrorize the enemy, and armored forces can crush the enemy, but only infantry can hold ground. Therefore, when victory lies in conquering territory, infantry makes the army crucial. A reporter recently traveled six thousand miles, visiting US Army bases, and what he saw was streamlined, modernized, mechanized, and specialized infantry. The old-style infantry was very simple: a dense formation of soldiers, carrying rifles and following their commander, with a few horse-drawn cannons and supply wagons. After research and battlefield tests, infantry officers formed a new-style triangular division, divided into three combat teams, each with an infantry regiment, and its own artillery, engineer, medical, signal, and transportation units. These combat teams can operate independently or in unison. It is said that this triangular division has superior organization, training, and firepower, so even though its combat strength is only fifteen thousand, its effectiveness exceeds the old-style square division. The old-style square division had eighteen thousand men divided into four units and auxiliary units. I visited the famous Second Division at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, reviewing its field work since 1937, which was adopted by the War Department as reference material for organizing the triangular division. The division had 560 officers and 13,500 men, and performed maneuvers before General Pershing and Third Army Commander General Bliss. The division had 1,300 transport vehicles, 267 automobiles, 175 motorcycles, 16 scout cars, 36 105mm howitzers, 12 155mm howitzers, 8 anti-tank guns, and many mortars. The entire division carried 7,199 .45 caliber pistols, 6,943 .30 caliber rifles, 375 Browning Automatic Rifles, 35 submachine guns, and 292 light and heavy machine guns. However, the triangular division has been improved along with vehicles. The streamlined, modernized triangular Fourth Division, commanded by Brigadier General Walter Short at Fort Benning, Georgia, has established the highest standards for infantry firepower and mobility. The Fourth Division is transported by motor vehicles. During field exercises, it used 2,600 vehicles of various types to travel 200 to 300 miles a day, making the division's speed, mobility, and firepower the best of all infantry divisions. I wanted to get a bird's-eye view of how a motorized division moved forward, so I flew over Fort Benning in an Army observation plane. What I saw was an endless column of transport vehicles, motorcycles, scout cars, command cars, armored vehicles, all motorized. This particular unit meandered along a winding road for fifty miles; the entire division would occupy one hundred and fifty miles. Each division, in addition to the basic units, also has an engineer battalion, a signal company, a supply battalion, a motorized reconnaissance company, and military police, and can be assisted by various aircraft and chemical warfare units. In a few weeks, each infantry division will receive fully fortified and highly powerful light vehicles. These vehicles can accommodate four people, have a top speed of one mile per minute, can climb steep slopes and cross valleys, and are very light; if they get stuck in the mud, the soldiers can lift one end. The standard weapon used by the US infantry division is the most powerful in the world. The Springfield rifle, which had a successful track record in previous wars, is being quickly replaced by the Garand rifle. A trained soldier can fire 35 rounds per minute with the Garand rifle, and 150 rounds per minute with the Springfield rifle. The 37mm anti-tank gun can fire 25 one-and-a-half pound high-explosive rounds per minute. The 81mm mortar can fire 18 eleven-pound shells per minute, reaching a height of 70 feet. The Browning .30 caliber machine gun can fire 430 rounds per minute. One afternoon, I watched a live-fire demonstration by a battalion of defenders at Fort Benning, showcasing the full potential of these weapons. At the commander's order, thousands of guns fired simultaneously. Even in broad daylight, the bullets flew clearly visible. From concealed positions, the guns unleashed a barrage of fire, until every square foot of land was riddled with bullet marks. At the same time, the artillery rumbled in the rear, and the shells flew high into the sky. After the tour, I said to an officer, "With a battalion of soldiers using these weapons, I wouldn't dare advance!" He replied, "Oh, there wasn't a battalion, only a platoon (twenty-four men). The crossfire of a battalion is also dangerous for bystanders, because of the risk of ricocheting bullets. I believe you are aware of that." (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>British Forces in North Africa Abandon Sollum</h3>
<p>Cairo: The British forces in Tobruk, Libya, launched a successful attack. The enemy forces around Halfaya Pass have not advanced, and their activity is limited to driving the British forces out of their positions.

<h3>Tunis Bombed: France Should Bear the Blame: The Port Should Not Be Used by Italy: Britain Has Not Received a Protest from Vichy</h3>
<p>London: Responsible sources in London confirmed last night that the Royal Air Force bombed the port of Sfax in Tunisia on May 28. A ship in the port caught fire. Nothing is known about the claim that the French ship "La Pelleya" was hit by a bomb. However, if "La Pelleya" was hit by a bomb while attacking Italian ships sheltering in the port, the blame lies with the French authorities for allowing enemy ships to operate and shelter from the rain from Tunisian waters and ports. The British government has already notified the Vichy government that Britain cannot recognize France's right to neutrality, and has issued a special warning to Vichy about the use of Tunisian waters. The British Air Force Command in Cairo issued a communiqué last night announcing that the British Air Force, which attacked the port of Sfax, Tunisia, hit a 4,000- to 5,000-ton motor ship with bombs. All the bombs dropped by the British aircraft hit their targets. Judging from the violent explosion and thick smoke after the ship was hit, the ship was clearly carrying munitions. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: No protest has been received here from Vichy regarding the British air raid on Sfax in Tunisia. If the claim that Washington has received this protest is indeed true, then this protest has not yet been sent to London. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>European War Chat (5)(9): London's Culture Under Bombs</h3>
<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, when newspapers had not yet become a force, prominent British writers generally used the publication of pamphlets as the most powerful medium for mobilizing public opinion. In modern times, this method of propaganda has rarely been noticed, but during this European war, it has become fashionable again.</p>
<p>The reason for the popularity of pamphlets is, on the one hand, that newspapers have reduced their size and do not have enough space for people to express their opinions and comment on the current situation. On the other hand, long works are affected by the rapidly changing situation and are difficult to suit the times. Publishers are naturally unwilling to publish a book that has become yesterday's news before it is published. But there is no risk in printing a sixty-four-page pamphlet. It can be written in one week, printed in two weeks, and immediately sold throughout the country.</p>
<p>Famous writers and publishers are now competing to publish pamphlets. Some pamphlets, priced at six pence each, are not reprints of old books, but are all brand-new materials, stacked prominently on bookstore counters, and sell as well as steamed buns just out of the steamer.</p>
<p>Among the writers of pamphlets, there are many outstanding figures, such as Sir Norman Angell, Ramsay Muir, Harold Nicolson, and Wickham Steed. Even the famous H.G. Wells does not demean himself by writing six-pence pamphlets. As for general authoritative scholars and historians, they do not hesitate to sell their brains for three-pence books. Anyone who spends this small amount can purchase any type of current affairs pamphlet published by Oxford University Press. Whether these pamphlets can be equated with the pamphlets of the seventeenth century in the future literary history is difficult to predict, but at least they will have some influence on society.</p>
<p>Holin, the editor of the magazine "Modern Life and Literature," once complained that writers have fewer outlets than other artists during wartime. Painters are allowed to go to the battlefield to take pictures for the country to preserve, but writers do not have equal rights. This man's argument is not really to the point, because writers also have the opportunity to observe the home front during wartime. Even people who are over the age for military service, if they are happy to write, do not have to worry about not finding good material.</p>
<p>The lives of wartime literati vary, but they are mostly focused on shifting reality. For example, Ms. Lehman said that she is impatient with everything, but she enjoys reading famous novels to pass the time. Walpole also said that since the start of the war, he has read a scene from Shakespeare's plays every morning before getting out of bed, enjoying it immensely and never interrupting it.</p>
<p>The literary critic塞尔曾在曼哲期德晚报上 said in the "Manchested Evening News" that he now likes to study metaphysics and nature poetry, living in two worlds of crazy reality and daytime dreams. He also believes that the best wartime reading is the diaries of famous people. Novels are too empty, biographies are enough to encourage people, but cannot escape reality, and history? History is being made and there is nothing to read. Poetry? It seems that it can be read, but as Edgar Allan Poe said, the greatest poetry cannot be enjoyed for more than half an hour. Only diaries are just right.</p>
<p>But麦克卡泰 holds a different view, believing that in this difficult autumn, reading poetry, if you can understand it with your heart, is actually more beneficial than novels. Poetry gives people a moment of life experience. If readers can understand the poet's experience, they will have the joy of being resourceful. So he is now studying poetry.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, book sales have plummeted. According to the "Publishers' Annual," only 10,732 books were published last year, a decrease of 4,179 from the previous year, a drop of 39 percent. Among them, children's books are the most unsalable, followed by novels, sociology books, science textbooks, notes, and travelogues.</p>
<p>Another major challenge for the British publishing industry is the issue of taxation. The government's new budget has divided commodity taxes into two categories: luxury goods are taxed at 24 percent, and other items, including books, are taxed at 12 percent. Newspapers and periodicals will also be taxed accordingly. When the House of Commons discussed the bill, Member of Parliament Herbert was the first to express his opposition, calling it absurd to levy a small tax on book publishing. He said that the "knowledge tax" had been eliminated between 1850 and 1870, and the principle of exempting spiritual reading materials from taxation was established, which had not changed through two world wars. How could the current Secretary of the Treasury recklessly destroy it? At the same time, members of parliament organized a "Committee to Defend Books" to advocate against book taxes. In London, this matter is called "a battle for books."</p>
<p>Finally, a Labour Party member proposed an amendment, saying that the book tax was very small and would be enough to affect exports, so it would be better to exempt it. The Secretary of the Treasury felt this was reasonable and decided to accept it. However, the "Committee to Defend Books" believes that this initial success is not permanent and does not intend to dissolve the organization immediately. However, this "battle for books" can be said to have come to an end.</p>

<p>Due to their inability to maintain their livelihoods, all teachers and staff members of Jinghua Elementary and Middle School on Haifang Road held a meeting on May 3rd and unanimously passed four demands to present to the school administration. Four weeks have passed since then, and the principal has ignored them. According to a representative of the teachers and staff who spoke to a reporter from Dahua News Agency yesterday, the teachers and staff have repeatedly made concessions under the principle of not striking, hoping to reach an understanding with the school administration and appealing to the students' parents for sympathy and assistance. Related parties have also sent personnel to mediate, but the principal has avoided negotiations, and no progress has been made. Therefore, the teachers and staff began their strike yesterday, resulting in a stalemate. In addition, a letter received from the Jinghua Education Department stated: "To whom it may concern, yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and our school was closed as usual. During dismissal, one or two teachers distributed leaflets outside the school gates, falsely claiming to represent all teachers and staff. The language used was inappropriate for the education sector and incited strikes. Our school currently has teachers and staff with years of service in education who deeply understand educational principles and are still teaching as usual. To prevent the outside world from misunderstanding the truth, we hereby declare this."</p>

<h3>Young Tennis Player Zheng Zhaojia's Recent Activities in the United States: Currently a Tennis Coach at the University of Missouri</h3>
<p>Chinese young tennis player Mr. Zheng Zhaojia, who twice represented China in the Davis Cup, has been in the United States for five years since leaving Shanghai. Compatriots are very concerned about him. News recently arrived from the United States that Zheng is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Missouri and has already obtained three degrees. In his spare time, Zheng also serves as the tennis coach for the University of Missouri team. Given the abundance of tennis talent in the United States, the fact that Zheng has been hired as the tennis coach demonstrates his significant progress in tennis skills. Zheng went to the United States with Xu Chengji in 1936 to represent China in the American Taiwanese Cup. He stayed in the United States without returning. The following year, he went to Paris from the United States to participate in the Taiwanese Cup against France, and then returned to the United States, where he has resided ever since.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's May 30th Commemoration: Shanghai's Various Circles Pledge to Serve the Country; Carrying on the Martyrs' Legacy to Fight for Freedom and Liberation; May Joint Defense Precaution to End Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 16th anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. Various circles in Shanghai commemorated the martyrs who sacrificed their lives, expressing deep sorrow. They maintained a silent demeanor as a solemn memorial. The concession authorities, considering the unstable situation and the fact that yesterday was the end-of-month settlement period for the Dragon Boat Festival, maintained strict vigilance throughout the day, deploying more detectives to patrol the roads and inspect suspicious pedestrians and vehicles to prevent incidents. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Solemnly Commemorating the May 30th Martyrs</p>
<p>Various circles, recognizing the unique environment of Shanghai, did not engage in extravagant May 30th commemorations. Instead, they expressed spiritual mourning with unwavering resolve and solemn emotions, and automatically observed a moment of silence, paying homage to the revolutionary pioneers and martyrs. They vowed to follow the martyrs' legacy, serve as role models for future generations, work together to strive for freedom and liberation, endure hardship to avenge national humiliation and family grievances.</p>
<p>End-of-Month Settlement for the Dragon Boat Festival Passed Peacefully</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival settlement day. All businesses, markets, and the money industry were closed for holiday. Companies, firms, and shops handled settlements, sending staff to collect outstanding customer debts. The market and finance remained stable, and all sectors peacefully passed this important period. Shanghai citizens continued the old customs, celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with rice dumplings and lycee, doubling the market price. However, the Refugee Relief Association appealed to all sectors to conserve resources and help the refugees.</p>
<p>May Joint Defense Ends Successfully</p>
<p>Since the two concession authorities implemented the May Joint Defense on May 1st, they have handled the situation properly, allowing all anniversaries to pass peacefully. Because of the Dragon Boat Festival settlement and the May 30th commemoration yesterday, the authorities also implemented special precautions and the day passed peacefully. As the Joint Defense period has ended, the authorities have decided to lift the Joint Defense starting at 5:00 AM tomorrow. However, for the welfare and safety of citizens and local order, ordinary precautions will continue to be implemented to prevent petty criminals from becoming active.</p>
<h3>American Legion Gathering Last Night</h3>
<p>The American Legion held its final meeting of the season at the American Club and on the USS Luzon gunboat yesterday evening at 7:00 PM. The USS Luzon also showed a movie.

<h3>French Authorities Establish Liaison Officer to Improve Relations with Japan; Mr. Pang Mochang Appointed</h3>
<p>Mr. Pang Mochang, former First Secretary of the French Embassy in Tokyo, has served in the French diplomatic community in Tokyo for about 30 years. He retired a few months ago and was awarded the Fourth Class Order by the Japanese government. Mr. Pang has now been appointed as a special liaison officer by the French authorities here and departed from Japan on the 29th of this month. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (31st) to take office, responsible for handling French-Japanese affairs on behalf of the French authorities. It is reported that Mr. Pang speaks fluent Japanese, and it is generally expected that relations between the French and Japanese authorities here will soon improve.</p>
<h3>Haiyi Vessel Sold; Price: 180,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Haiyi vessel, owned by the German Far East Shipping Company, has a capacity of over 200 tons and operates in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Jiangbei ports, as well as the eastern Zhejiang area. Recently, due to the monopolization of Yangtze River transport and the blockade of eastern Zhejiang, it has had no place to operate and has been out of service for a long time. It is reported that it has recently been purchased by China Central Shipping Company for a price of 180,000 yuan in legal currency. The transaction has already been completed. The vessel was formerly known as the Donghai and was later renamed Haiyi after flying the German flag. The hull is made of wood. After the China Central Shipping Company purchased it, it is currently undergoing repairs and will continue to operate in the small Yangtze River in the future.</p>
<h3>Eighteen Taxi Companies Go on Strike; Labor and Management Stalemate</h3>
<p>The drivers and mechanics of eighteen smaller taxi companies in this city, including Yitai, Huali, Jiangsu, Youning, Shijie, Yazhou, Yuegong, etc., have recently faced high rice prices and difficult living conditions. They jointly requested a 50% increase in rice subsidies (based on the original rice subsidy) from the employers some time ago. However, the employers rejected their request, and the workers went on strike starting at midnight on the 25th of last month. It is learned that the employers issued a warning to the workers the day before yesterday, requiring them to resume work within three days, otherwise new workers would be hired. However, two days have passed since the warning was issued, and if the workers do not respond today, it may be difficult to resolve the issue in the short term.</p>
<h3>Land and Water Transport Restored in Jinhua, Lishui, and Yongkang</h3>
<p>The war situation in eastern Zhejiang has stabilized, and Haimen, Wenzhou, and other places have been successively recovered. Passenger buses between Jinhua and Lishui, and between Yongkang and Lishui, have resumed service yesterday. Previously interrupted, they have now resumed service. Passenger buses from Lishui to Longquan have also resumed service. It is also learned that fast boats between Lishui, Bihu, and Songyang have also resumed navigation. They depart from Lishui at 4:30 AM every day. The fares are temporarily set at 15 yuan from Lishui to Songyang, 4 yuan from Lishui to Bihu, and 7 yuan from Lishui to Dagangtou.</p>
<h3>Exploring Roosevelt's Speech: The United States Has Not Neglected Japan; Japan is the Second Weak Link in the Axis; Western Newspapers Speculate on Future American Strategy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Continental Daily editorial continued to discuss President Roosevelt's fireside chat, stating that since President Roosevelt's fireside chat, the US government's policy has been clearly expressed. The US policy includes (1) providing as much material assistance to China and Britain as possible, (2) maintaining freedom of the seas, (3) protecting the Western Hemisphere from all aggression, and (4) supporting these policies with force when necessary. Although Japan's response to US policy is not as strong as Germany's, if Japan's foreign policy does not change, the US's hostility towards Japan will not be less than that towards Germany. Some Chinese people have expressed disappointment with President Roosevelt's speech because it did not guarantee direct action against Japan. However, we must know that it would be unwise to state in advance where the US armed forces will first launch their attack. If we study the US strategy carefully, we can know that the US will not neglect the harm Japan can do. The US may even deal with Japan before dealing with Germany. Strategically speaking, it is best to seek out the weak points in the enemy's line and attack them first. Italy has already been defeated, and the second weak link in the Axis line is Japan.</p>
<h3>American Community Commemorates Fallen Soldiers; Memorial Service Held; US Consul and Bishop Hall Participate; Cullem Encourages American Loyalty and Patriotism</h3>
<p>The United States has traditionally designated May 30th as Memorial Day to commemorate fallen soldiers. The American community in Shanghai gathered at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery at 8:30 AM yesterday (May 30th) to hold a memorial service, presided over by US Consul General Lockehead and with prayers by Bishop Hall.</p>
<p>Remembering the Martyrs, Defending Democracy</p>
<p>Then, US military chaplain Cullem delivered a speech, encouraging compatriots to be loyal and patriotic and to remember the senior comrades who sacrificed their lives for the country. His exhortation stated, "Today's citizens, respecting the martyrs, should practice the ideals sought by the martyrs in past wars and protect the even nobler ideals that form the foundation and soul of our democratic system. The best way to commemorate the fallen soldiers is to resolutely resist anything that destroys these noble ideals."</p>
<p>Playing the National Anthem, Solemn and Respectful</p>
<p>Following this, the blessing was given by Dr. Mindes, President of the Overseas American Association, and the US Marine Corps Band played the national anthem. A squad of US sailors and the American team of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps were present. The solemn and respectful service ended with the sound of a bugle played by a Navy bugler. According to reports, American Memorial Day originated after the end of the American Civil War, when General Logan expressed his approval of scattering flowers on the graves of fallen soldiers. He then issued an order designating May 30, 1868, as the first Memorial Day. Since then, the practice of scattering flowers and national flags on the graves of fallen soldiers has continued to this day and has become a convention.</p>
<h3>Iranian Minister to Japan Makes a Short Stay in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Iranian Minister to Japan, Nojem, passed through Shanghai. Yesterday, he told a Western reporter that the Iranian people are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the European war. Although their location is close to the Iraqi war zone, their daily lives and work continue as usual without interruption. Nojem said that this was his first time in the Far East, so he planned to stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Tokyo. He said that Shanghai is a wonderful city, but he did not compare it to any Iranian city. He said that the extravagance of Shanghai is even greater than that of Europe, which he found quite peculiar. He did not want to comment much on the outcome of the European war. He said that his trip to Shanghai was of a private nature, so he did not want to get involved in political issues. Nojem was deeply amazed by the diversity of languages spoken in Shanghai and regretted not knowing English.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Shell Sailing Boats off Zhenhai's Sanshanpu; Seven Killed or Injured</h3>
<p>Off the coast of Zhenhai's Sanshanpu, at 9:00 PM on the 7th of this month, five sailing boats from the Jintang area were sailing towards Xinqi when they were suddenly spotted by two small Japanese warships anchored off Sanshanpu. The warships immediately fired more than 20 shells at them, hitting two of the boats, which immediately sank. Passengers Zhang Changxin, Hong Fangyu, Yao Zhenfa, Wang Afeng, Xu Alin, and others were killed, and Yao Axiang, Chen Kaitai, and others were injured. The luggage and belongings on board were also swept away by the waves. After shelling, the Japanese warships immediately sailed to the Jintang coast and anchored. After the incident, local residents and boatmen went into the sea to rescue people and recovered 16 passengers, including Zheng Zhuangbao, as well as the injured Yao Axiang and others. They also recovered the bodies of five men and women and many pieces of luggage. In addition to notifying the families of the victims and collecting the bodies, they also sent the injured passengers to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Earlier Hours for French Concession Sanitation Work</h3>
<p>The Sanitation Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, in view of the arrival of summer, the increasing heat, and the denser population within the concession compared to previous years, and considering that the spread of epidemics is easy to spread if citizens do not pay attention to hygiene at this time, is urgently implementing various public health measures. In addition to starting free vaccinations, the Municipal Council has decided that starting from June 1st (tomorrow), all garbage trucks within the concession, originally scheduled to start work at 4:00 AM every day, will start work earlier at 12:00 AM every day. This is to ensure that the fresh air within the concession at dawn is not polluted by the stench. It is also heard that the time for clearing garbage within the concession will also be advanced.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Cotton Cloth Parcel Deliveries to Various Postal Areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, and Shanghai</h3>

<h3>All Rice Merchants in the City Must Register Their Rice Stock with the Bureau; Stock Already Arrived Should Report the Name of the Warehouse Where It Is Stored; Stock Not Yet Arrived Should Fill in the Route of Transportation</h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions, in view of the rising tide of labor unrest in various industries and the instability of social order, mostly caused by the rapid rise in rice prices, the two authorities are sparing no effort to curb rice prices and stabilize the people's food supply. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the concession authorities yesterday that the two authorities have decided to take more effective measures to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai. They have already ordered the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association to immediately notify all members of the industry to truthfully report all domestic and foreign rice stocks, whether they have arrived or are in transit, so that formal statistics can be compiled. It is reported that the authorities made thorough research before taking this measure, which is considered the only effective way to prevent the transfer of rice and grain to other ports and to crack down on speculation and hoarding. It is reported that the registration method is divided into (A) items that have already arrived at the warehouse: (1) name and address of the warehouse where the rice is stored, (2) quantity stored, (3) type of rice, (4) name of the owner of the goods, (5) address of the owner of the goods, (6) date of arrival at the warehouse, (7) cost price of the rice, etc.; (B) items that have not arrived: (1) foreign rice handled on behalf of others, (2) rice transport vehicle, (3) date of arrival, (4) origin of the rice, (5) name of the person who placed the order, (6) intended warehouse for storage, (7) type of rice, (8) cost price, (9) name and address of the orderer's business, etc.</p>
<p>Additional Import Rice Can Be Approved and Issued Today</p>
<p>In the rice market these days, due to some purchases from inland areas and for re-export, rice merchants are taking the opportunity to engage in speculation and raise prices. As a result, retail rice shops have also raised prices at the same time. Residents are buying affordable imported rice, causing sales in rice shops to increase sharply. Various grain stores have requested additional purchases from Xiang Mao Foreign Firm. It is currently under review. It is expected that the amount each store can be allocated may be announced this morning. Furthermore, according to a letter from Jin Feng Rice Store, the previous report that the store was subject to a suspension of sales of imported rice has been clarified with Li Ji Foreign Firm. The registration was duplicated, resulting in a misunderstanding. They have already resumed shipping and selling through distributors.</p>
<p>Da Fu Foreign Firm's Second Sale</p>
<p>In order to suppress the market price of tribute rice transported to Shanghai for sale, the French Concession Public Works Bureau previously ordered various foreign firms handling tribute rice that, regardless of the quality of tribute rice they handle in the future, they must not set prices privately for the rice to be sold after it arrives in port. All prices must be approved by the authorities. All foreign firms have now complied with the order. Therefore, the market price of tribute rice sold in this city will gradually decline. Da Fu Foreign Firm had previously sold No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon mixed broken rice at a market price of 98.8 yuan per bag. According to the foreign firm's announcement yesterday, they sold approximately 450 tons of broken rice yesterday, with the market price approved by the French authorities at 97.5 yuan per bag. The stated prices are the prices at which the foreign firm sells to rice merchants. As for the rice merchants' resale, they are given a generous profit margin of 8% or 5%.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Tribute Rice Arrive in Succession</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the French Postal Shipping Company yesterday, the company's ship "Beina Ting Sheng Billa" arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month via Saigon and Manila. The ship was berthed at Hongkou. The ship carried 12,000 bags of tribute rice. The "Tao Li Shi" arrived here yesterday from Saigon. In addition to carrying 5,200 bags of tribute rice, the ship also carried 6,900 tons of Annam coal. The "Kai Ting" ship is expected to arrive today, but the amount of rice it carries was not reported accurately yesterday. The above-mentioned tribute rice has already begun to be unloaded. According to rice industry sources, the tribute rice carried by the above ships is mostly broken rice, with a cost price of only about 100 yuan per bag. Therefore, the cost for rice merchants is very low. In the coming days, large quantities of tribute rice will continue to be shipped here.</p>
<h3>French Postal Ship "Xia Fei" Did Not Set Sail Yesterday; Rumor Has It That the Crew Suddenly Caused Disturbances</h3>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the departure date of the French postal ship "Xia Fei" from Shanghai to Vietnam has been postponed. It is widely believed that this was caused by disturbances among the ship's crew. Rumor has it that several of the company's oil-burning ships sailing between Shanghai and Vietnam will be suspended due to fuel shortages. Furthermore, yesterday morning (the 30th), there were rumors outside that the schedules of the French Postal Shipping Company's ships had been cancelled. This statement was denied by Ke Xide, the company's general manager for the Far East. However, Mr. Ke refused to explain why the "Xia Fei," which was originally scheduled to depart on the 29th, had not sailed even by yesterday morning. Well-informed sources said that the crew of the "Xia Fei" suddenly caused disturbances when the ship was about to set sail, and the details are currently unknown. On the other hand, it is said that the French Postal Shipping Company's oil-burning ships will be suspended, while the coal-burning ships will continue to operate as usual. An employee of the company said that the company expects five more ships to arrive in Shanghai before June 10, which shows that the ships have not been completely suspended.</p>
<h3>Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds to Be Drawn for Redemption</h3>
<p>The total amount of the Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds is 6 million national currency. It was underwritten by British Liyan Foreign Firm at 80% of the face value. Now, in order to maintain creditworthiness, although Shanghai has fallen, the principal and interest of the bonds are being repaid on schedule. The 17th drawing for redemption was held at HSBC Bank the day before yesterday. The two winning numbers were 34 and 43, each worth 60,000 yuan, totaling 120,000 yuan in principal repayment. The principal and interest due will be paid by British HSBC Bank starting from June 15th and is expected to continue until December 15, 1952, when all principal and interest will be fully repaid. The majority of bondholders are foreign residents in Shanghai, who deeply admire the Chinese government's maintenance of creditworthiness.</p>
<h3>Kong Zhiqing Bonsai Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Temporary Electricity Surcharge Calculated According to US Dollar Exchange Rate; Electricity Company Announced Implementation Yesterday; Expected to Be Reduced According to Current Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>After the Public Works Bureau approved the price increase for public utilities in the Public Concession starting from July 1st, the Shanghai Electric Power Company issued a public notice yesterday stating, "With the approval of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau, in addition to the current foreign exchange and fuel surcharges, an additional</p>
<p>temporary surcharge</p>
<p>will be added to the basic electricity rates for all types of power supply. This surcharge is 50%, based on an exchange rate of 5.25 US dollars to 100 national currency, and will be adjusted monthly by the Public Works Bureau and the company in accordance with the fluctuations in the exchange rate, following the procedures stipulated for the foreign exchange surcharge. The newly revised surcharge will apply to bills for electricity periods ending on or after</p>
<p>July 1, 1941,</p>
<p>and is subject to the various terms and conditions accepted by the company." At that time, the black market foreign exchange had shrunk to a tightest price of 5.125 US dollars, hence this calculation rate. However, the current black market exchange rate has been extended to 5.40625, an extension of more than five levels (i.e., 5.28125, 3125, 34375, 375, 40625). The international situation is deteriorating, and the black market exchange rate may continue to rise. Therefore, the calculation rate of the new surcharge must be reduced at that time.</p>
<h3>Smoking Should Be Strictly Prohibited in Factories and Airports</h3>
<p>Public Concession Fire Department investigation: A major fire occurred at Jingwu Toy Factory, 749 Kunming Road, Hudong, on the 28th, causing a loss of 200,000 yuan and burning to death one worker. The cause was a worker dropping a lit cigarette. It has been found that celluloid toy raw materials and gasoline are extremely flammable when ignited. Therefore, all factories and airports have been urged to strictly prohibit workers from smoking cigarettes in order to prevent unfortunate tragedies.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Burma Plan to Establish Sino-Burmese National Goods Company</h3>
<p>Recently, many overseas Chinese in Burma have jointly funded the establishment of the Sino-Burmese National Goods Company in order to facilitate the sale of domestic products and promote Sino-Burmese trade. The headquarters will be located in Yangon, with a capital of 300,000 Burmese kyats, borne by the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the China National Goods Company, and the Bank of China, each contributing 100,000 Burmese kyats. The company's planning is progressing smoothly. In the future, the goods sold will be exclusively domestic products. At that time, letters will be sent to various domestic goods organizations in this city to introduce genuine domestic goods factories so that they can directly contact and ship goods on schedule for consignment sales. At the same time, it is hoped that efforts will be made to improve the following points: (1) The delivery date should be accurate, (2) The packaging method should be precise, (3) The price should be preferential and self-sacrificing.</p>
<h3>Three French Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The French Postal Shipping Company cargo ship "Beina Ting Sheng Billa" arrived in Shanghai on the 29th from Saigon. The new ship "Tao Li Zi" arrived yesterday, and the "Kai Ting" ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The three French ships arrived in succession, all carrying huge amounts of rice.</p>
<h3>Eyewitness Account of a Brain Dissection (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Xian Li</p>
<p>Dr. Su used cotton wool dipped in iodine to rub the shaved area on the right side of the patient's head, as calmly as a barber applying hair oil to a customer's head. After repeating the rubbing several times, he began to inject a large amount of local anesthetic into the area to be operated on, first subcutaneous injection, then intramuscular injection. The patient's right skull seemed to be hurt, and a small bump swelled up.</p>
<p>After the injection was completed, Dr. Su picked up a knife and drew a two-and-a-half-inch-long "king" character on the bump, with the top and bottom strokes half as short as the middle stroke. This mark was the basis for the later operation.</p>
<p>The nurse handed over a piece of white canvas with a hole in the middle, covering the patient's head, leaving only the long "king" character written on the flesh with a knife. Dr. Su skillfully picked up two safety pins, like a mother changing a diaper for an infant, and pinned the cloth to the patient's scalp.</p>
<p>Dr. Su picked up a sharp knife and cut down on the vertical stroke of the "king" character on the patient's head. The skin broke, blood flowed, and the nurse handed over the clamps one by one. Dr. Su took them and clamped the bleeding blood vessels under the patient's skin one by one. The bleeding stopped, and my pounding heart calmed down.</p>
<p>Dr. Su aimed at the wound and continued to cut down. In the fifteen minutes after the operation, he had cut to the patient's skull. The white skull bone was clearly visible in the two-and-a-half-inch-long, one-inch-wide red flesh seam.</p>
<p>After a short rest, and using a suction tube to suck away the blood at any time, Dr. Su picked up a large drill and rotated it on the patient's skull. An assistant dripped a transparent, colorless liquid on the right side. Dr. Su spent a lot of effort to drill a round hole the size of a one-cent nickel coin in the patient's skull. Taking out the circular skull bone, Dr. Su said casually in English, "Her bone is quite hard?"</p>
<p>Using this small round hole as a base, Dr. Su used pliers to clamp out small pieces of the patient's skull bone, clamping it into a one-and-a-half-inch square hole. The patient's meninges were jumping inside the bone hole.</p>
<p>The patient groaned in a coma, "It hurts! It hurts so much!" The assistant doctor and the nurse laughed. The patient groaned again, "I want to die!" Dr. Su patted the canvas covering the patient's head with his hand. The sound of the suction machine's motor and the patient's snoring merged into one.</p>
<p>Using that small base, Dr. Su was developing the site with his skillful wrist. He sometimes used a knife, sometimes electricity, sometimes a suction machine, sometimes pliers, sometimes cotton wool, sometimes gauze, sometimes bone wax, and dug down towards the patient's cheek step by step. The damage to the suction machine's motor took up some necessary time. Other than that, the operation proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>Dr. Su found the nerve that was causing trouble on the patient's cheek at nearly 3:45. At this time, Dr. Su stopped and asked the nurse what the patient's blood pressure and pulse were, and then instructed the assistant to inject the patient with a blood tonic. Then, he pointed out the white nerve in the flesh seam to the two doctors and me who were watching. Then, he used a knife and electricity to destroy the nerve.</p>
<p>"Do you want to see the human brain?" Dr. Su turned his head and asked me with a smile. I couldn't say anything, so I just nodded. He cut the meninges that were jumping in the patient's skull seam into a one-inch-long tear, and the human brain was clearly revealed.</p>
<p>The operation was completed. The patient lost a piece of skull bone and also lost the pain caused by the nerve. Like a seamstress, Dr. Su took the clip of semi-circular needles and catgut from the nurse's hand and sewed up the wound on the patient one stitch at a time, with an assistant tying the knots. First, he sewed the muscles, first two layers, and then the skin once.</p>
<p>When the assistant doctor was bandaging the patient's wound, it was already half past four. We watched Dr. Su step out of the operating room. Dr. Jiang picked up the skull model and explained the dissected part to us with great interest. He said that near the nerve that had just been destroyed, there were large blood vessels and other nerves. If he was not careful, the patient would be in danger. It was like an explorer describing his adventurous experiences.</p>
<p>I re-entered the dressing room, took off the white hat, untied the mask, took off the blood-stained white coat, and put on my original clothes again. When I stepped out of the dressing room, Dr. Su was washing his arms vigorously again.</p>
<p>When I walked out of the Red Cross, it was already five o'clock. The scorching sun of May shone on the body of a tired and exhausted fake doctor. His body was tired, but his spirit was excited for the continuation of the medical world. He praised the progress of medicine. (The End)</p>
<h3>Foreign Traveler Talks About the Situation in Free France; People Lack Nutrition and Have a Sallow Complexion; Oppose Germany and Italy and Eagerly Hope for a British Victory</h3>
<p>A certain foreign traveler, who did not want to reveal his name for political reasons, traveled in France for four months and recently arrived in Shanghai. He told reporters yesterday that the people in the Free French region are suffering greatly from famine, and there is a possibility of an epidemic soon. The impact on the next generation of French people will be unimaginable, perhaps similar to the situation in Russia in 1928.</p>
<p>The People's Livelihood Reaches the Extreme of Hardship</p>
<p>The tragedy he saw was more terrible than the collapse of politics and the military. Now, children with sallow complexions are everywhere, and many are sick due to malnutrition. In the un-occupied area, butter and meat are no longer available. The government rations adults, with only two slices of bread per day. Meat is only issued once a week. Most families only have vegetables for lunch and dinner every day, and only vegetable soup for breakfast.</p>
<p>Unanimously Hope for a British Victory</p>
<p>Except for the officials in the Vichy government, the political life of the French people has ceased to exist due to famine and defeat. But in terms of their political ideas, there are now two factions with equal strength. One is pro-British, whose slogan is "May our friend Britain win." The other is anti-British, whose slogan is "May the hateful Britain win."</p>
<p>Marshal Petain is Highly Respected</p>
<p>In the Free French region, Marshal Petain is highly respected. The general public firmly believes that although he is old, he presides over the Vichy government under German pressure. Besides Marshal Petain, there seems to be no more suitable person to rely on. Laval's reputation is not well-known, and he may not be able to achieve his goal of becoming a leader. The youth movement of the centralized front is no longer seen among the French people, and even German propaganda activities have disappeared.</p>
<p>The People Crave News from Abroad</p>
<p>Unemployment is very common in France. However, most young people are forced to join the "Youth Camp" to build roads for the government or engage in other public works. French people obtain news about the outside world from government-managed radio stations and newspapers. However, reading Swiss newspapers is not prohibited. The authorities do not explicitly prohibit individuals from listening to British broadcasts, so French people who have radios and are proficient in English can listen.</p>
<p>British Citizens are Well Treated in France</p>
<p>There are still many British citizens in Cannes, France. They cannot remit funds to the UK. However, French innkeepers or landlords are willing to allow them to delay paying for food and lodging until after the war. There are also many Jews in France. They are quite wealthy, and the anti-Jewish laws announced by the Vichy government under Nazi pressure are not very strict.</p>
<p>Anti-Italian Sentiment is Higher Than Everything Else</p>
<p>The French people have no anti-Jewish sentiments. The only countries that French people hate the most are Germany and Italy. However, the French hate Italians even more than Germans. The French believe that Germany is still fighting with open guns, while Italians are attacking with hidden arrows. At present, the French people use bicycles instead of cars due to the lack of gasoline. Even the former car-owning class must now ride bicycles.</p>
<h3>Fire at Wang Dayou Candle Store; Child's Body Pulled Out</h3>
<p>At 11:20 PM the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out at Wang Dayou Candle Store, 682 Guangxi Road, Jiujiang Road, Public Concession. The flames soared into the sky and were unstoppable. After receiving the news, the fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until after 12:00 AM. In addition to destroying the store, the fire also spread to five neighboring buildings, including Lu Gaojian Meat Store, Baolong Sauce Garden, Hongfa Xiang Paper Shop, and Beiping Mingfa Tang Pharmacy. When the fire was raging, a resident, Wu Shutang (43 years old), and his wife, Wu Shou (39 years old), were seriously injured while escaping. They were sent to the hospital for treatment. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, firefighters pulled out the body of a child from the rubble. It was found to be the daughter of the owner of Wang Dayou Candle Store, only nine years old. She unfortunately died in the fire. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Jueyuan Buddhist Pure Land Society Provides Free Medical Care and Medicine; Life is Extremely Difficult, Medical Treatment is Crowded; Expenses are Huge, Hope for Donations</h3>
<p>The charity department of the Jueyuan Buddhist Pure Land Society on Hede Road has been providing free Chinese and Western medical care and medicine for 15 years. Every day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, each person is charged a registration fee of 40 cents (poor patients are still exempt). Chinese medicine is given for one dose, and Western medicine is given for two days. The amount varies. If serious patients need injections, they will be given injections. Therefore, in 1940 alone, there were more than 66,000 registrations. There are even more this year, with more than 200 registrations every day. Because Chinese and Western medicine are expensive, and the price of everything is soaring, the middle class also has difficulty making a living, and many go to the society for medical treatment. Therefore, people are more crowded and expenses are greater. The society never solicits donations from the outside. Since the increase in medical visits, expenses have increased more than ten times. It relies solely on the organizers to raise funds and feels deeply exhausted. Now that summer is approaching, medical services will inevitably become more developed. If people from all walks of life have sympathy for the society's cause, they will be able to donate more to help solve the difficulty of public medical problems.</p>
<h3>Pickpockets Arrested in the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track</h3>
<p>Guangdong pickpocket king Ye Caibang, 30 years old, Li Xitian, 26 years old, Zhou Zhuo, 28 years old, and more than ten others recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. They were dressed in suits and leather shoes and behaved lavishly. Those who did not know them thought they were wealthy young men. They often used large hotels as gathering places. The night before last, they went to the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track on Albert Road in the French Concession to practice their skills. It was learned by French patrolmen and detectives Ke Enqing and Wang Yuanqi, who arrested Wang and the other three and took them to the police station for custody, awaiting the arrest of accomplices for joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Dong Yugui Chopped with an Ax</h3>
<p>Dong Yugui, 38 years old, unemployed, lives at 4 Zhong'an Lane, Edward Road, French Concession. His wife is a performer of Shanghai opera at Tianchan Teahouse on Yu Qiaqing Road. At around 12:00 AM the night before last, Dong returned home from the teahouse with his wife and mother-in-law. When they arrived at the entrance of the lane, Dong went to the adjacent cigarette store to buy cigarettes. The mother and daughter went inside first. As soon as they arrived home, they suddenly heard Dong calling for help. They rushed out to see Dong lying on the ground, his head and hands severely chopped, and seriously injured. An ax was left beside him. The injured person was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. It is said that it was impossible to identify the perpetrator at the time, and he did not know the reason for the attack. Dong had recently worked in a gambling den in Nanshi and usually made a living by lending money at high interest rates. This attack was probably due to a personal vendetta.</p>
<h3>Nephew Assaults Aunt</h3>
<p>The person from 774 Lane 2, Hai Zai Road, Shen Qiusheng, is addicted to gambling and does not work. He often insulted his elders for trivial matters. Last month, he beat his aunt, Cai Shen. The victim had no choice but to file a private prosecution. On the 28th of this month, the court ruled that Shen Qiusheng injured another person's body and was fined 100 yuan as a warning. If he is to perform corvée labor, he is to be paid at two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Solo Exhibition of Young Calligrapher Wen Yongchen</h3>
<p>Wen Yongchen's calligraphy exhibition on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company is full of beautiful works. Among the exhibits, thousands of words in small regular script are written on paper less than an inch square, which is beautiful and dignified, and can be described as a unique skill. There is also an inscription of maxims, more than three feet long, with a line of small regular script resembling hair hanging in the air, upright and beautiful. Looking at this small regular script with a microscope, one feels amazed. The handwriting is magnified under the microscope, the strokes are clear, and the characters are meticulously done. Introduced by the person in charge of Daxin Company, I met Mr. Wen. Upon meeting, I realized that Mr. Wen is a young calligrapher, humble and polite. He said that the exhibition was prepared in less than a week, and each work is exquisite and perfect, truly a masterpiece. Mr. Wen wields his brush on the spot, using the brush in the same way as ordinary people, without the aid of any magnifying glass, which surprised the reporter greatly.</p>

<h3>Foreign Rice Pouring In</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. A French company had a ship arrive the day before yesterday, directly from Xishi (Saigon), carrying over 30,000 bags of rice. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Dulis arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying over 5,000 bags from Saigon, which are being unloaded and transferred at buoys 14 and 15. It is said that the Jindiya is expected to arrive today, but the amount of foreign rice it is carrying is not yet known until the ship arrives. The Taikoo Company's Guiyang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying only 300 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Today, 3,620 bags of corn will be loaded onto the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng, which will transport it to Yantai. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Declines, Cloth Exports Increase</h3>
<p>New York cotton market: Due to a poor weather report, but offset by profit-taking by bulls and political news from Crete favorable to bears, the closing price was down 5 to 14 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>Bombay cotton market: Initially, prices rose due to short covering in July and August, then softened slightly due to profit-taking by bulls, and finally rose again due to short covering. At the close, except for White Loch, which rose 12 rupees in the near term, the remaining gains and losses were 1 to 2 rupees. Furthermore, today's opening price forecast was not reached.</p>
<p>Fifteen pieces of Shanghai poplin were shipped to Hong Kong, another 154 pieces to Singapore, and another 288 pieces to Xiaoluzong (Philippines). Forty pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, another 40 pieces to Singapore, and 75 pieces to Xiaoluzong.</p>
<h3>Sugar, Beans, and Tea Exports and Imports</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 29th), 1,260 bags of foreign sugar were imported from Hong Kong. On the 30th, 100 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, and another 300 bags to Xiaoluzong. 183 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Singapore, and another 100 pieces to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Hardware Industry Safely Passes Dragon Boat Festival, Prices of All Goods Relatively Firm and High</h3>
<p>The hardware industry safely passed the Dragon Boat Festival yesterday. With the supply routes from Hong Kong reportedly cut off, the source of goods has been interrupted. The prices of various goods, which were in a weak state, have become firm and high again. The morale in the industry has also risen accordingly. The prices of various items are unusually firm and high. Several types are described below:</p>
<p>American Narrow Strip Iron: The amount of goods circulating in the market is scarce, and the overseas supply has recently been cut off again. Hoarders and users are eagerly searching for it, so the available goods are even more insufficient. The market supply cannot meet the demand, causing the standard prices to be raised. Yesterday, the uniform color was sold for 320 yuan per box (200 pounds), and the selected color was not available for sale due to the even greater shortage of goods.</p>
<p>American Galvanized Iron Sheet: 26 and 28 gauge American flat galvanized iron sheets are also in short supply, and there are not many people in Shanghai who hold these goods. Therefore, the market is in good condition, and transactions are quite lively. Industry members' morale remains firm, and prices are high. Yesterday, 26 gauge was sold for 450 yuan per dan, while 28 gauge required around 500 yuan per dan, an increase of more than 1.20 yuan from before.</p>
<p>Straits Tinplate: The market for Straits tinplate, which has been firm for a long time, has not seen many transactions in recent days. However, due to the intentions of the holders, they are reluctant to sell easily. The total inventory in the city is only a few dozen boxes. If it is searched for, the available goods on the market will be exhausted, and the source will become a problem, causing the standard sales prices to rise again and again. Currently, 24 gauge is priced at 1,200 yuan per box, while 26 gauge requires around 900 yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Sericulture Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Da Yu</p>
<p>(1) The Proportion of Chinese Silk in the US Increases Significantly</p>
<p>In the past three years, the overall consumption of silk in the United States has been shrinking, but the proportion of Chinese silk has increased year by year. This is a welcome phenomenon due to changes in international sentiment. However, conversely, it is also a fact that the trade of British and American trading houses exporting Shanghai raw silk has declined in the past three years, while the proportion of trade of Japanese trading houses has increased. The following is a summary of the import statistics of the US raw silk market from 1938 to 1940:</p>
<p>Since Shanghai silk has been restricted by the "Goods Movement Ban", British and American exporters are in an even more difficult situation. Currently, those who want to export must contact the Bank of Japan for foreign exchange, so Japanese merchants have become the sole force in the export of raw silk. However, after being imported into the United States, it must be resold to the Shanghai foreign merchant agents in New York, so the problem of the opposition between Chinese and Japanese raw silk in the US market remains the same.</p>
<p>(2) Claws and Fangs of the Central China Company</p>
<p>In July 1938, the Central China Silk Association, based on 2,200 silk reeling machines from nine silk factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, began to reel raw silk. It was officially announced on August 10 of the same year. It is the "centralized control agency for the Central China silk industry". The capital is 8 million yuan. The Chinese side contributed 2 million yuan in kind, and the Japanese side contributed 3 million yuan in cash. The following year, in March, the company expanded its business and increased its capital, which was still invested by the Central China Revitalization Company.</p>
<p>The silk business of Central China, including machine reeling, manufacturing and distributing silkworm eggs, etc., is all under the control of the Central China Company. As of April 1940, the number of silk reeling factories had increased to 21, the number of silk reeling machines had reached 7,500, the number of employees had reached more than 17,000, and the silk production had reached 38,000 dan.</p>
<p>Regarding seed production, it is also monopolized by them. It is estimated that in the spring of 1938, they supplied 20%, in the autumn, they supplied 75%, and after 1939, they have occupied all of it. Regarding cocoon collection, in the spring of 1939, they purchased 200,000 dan of cocoons through the original cocoon shops, using an established method to purchase from various places. In the autumn of the same year, they collected 60,000 dan of cocoons. In addition, they also purchased 86,900 dan of dried cocoons. By 1940, they had purchased a total of 130,000 dan of spring and autumn cocoons.</p>
<p>(3) Currency Issues and Control</p>
<p>More than 70% of Central China's silk has fallen into the hands of control, but the complexity of currency issues has caused distress to the control. According to the Japanese Far East Trade Monthly: "The currency problem is quite difficult. The concession and cocoon producing areas all require legal tender, but military tickets are circulating in the Japanese-occupied areas, and the currency for buying and selling is Huaxing coupons, so the operation of the Central China Silk Company is quite difficult. The Huaxing coupons originally borrowed fell with the legal tender, and as a result, a foreign exchange loss of 5.5 million yuan occurred..."</p>
<p>A foreign exchange loss of 5.5 million yuan cannot be said to be a small distress. Therefore, since the end of 1939, the Central China Silk Company and exporters have been pricing in US dollars, and later they have gone a step further and selling and buying in US dollars, so they say: "Therefore, the solution to today's currency problem is an urgent matter."</p>
<p>(4) The Mystery of Two Factions' Opinions</p>
<p>The shrinking of US raw silk consumption in recent years will probably shrink further with the tension of the situation. This makes the conflict between Chinese and Japanese raw silk in the United States even more intense. This stalemate has made the Japanese Silk Bureau feel anxious. Because if it is necessary to maintain the establishment of the Central China Silk Company, it must take the road of improving technology and increasing semi-production, but this will hit Japanese silk in the US market. Because of this, they have produced two factions of opinions. The first faction belongs to those who invest in the Central China Silk Company and operate exports. They all advocate that light industries such as silkworm rearing and silk production should be entrusted to Chinese regions with low production costs. Japan should specialize in heavy industry. And the other faction in the government advocates that "the first step is to correct the comprehensive dependence of the Japanese silk industry on exports. If it is necessary to shift the focus to China, then it is necessary to seek other ways to solve the problem of the export market."</p>
<p>However, these positive and negative opinions are, in any case, difficulties for the silk industry. What's more, the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly dangerous. As for how it will be, let us wait and see!</p>
<p>(5) North China is Also Promoting Sericulture</p>
<p>According to news from friends in Linyu County, the Linyu Xingyu Silkworm Forest Company has been actively promoting sericulture in recent years, and the promotion effect in the Linyu, Luan County, and Lulong areas is quite gratifying. Most farmers have felt interested, so the future seems to have general hope. It is recently learned that the company plans to further expand the sericulture area this year. In addition to distributing improved silkworm eggs to the counties under the jurisdiction of Jidongdao as usual, it will also establish the Xingyu Silkworm Forest Silk Factory in Beiping to provide free distribution of improved silkworm eggs. At this time of silkworm cocoon development, it is heard that 180,000 sheets of domestic and wild silkworm eggs are expected to be distributed this year.</p>
<h3>Economic Jottings</h3>
<p>— Feng Liuying</p>
<p>Price Statistics</p>
<p>Statistics is a field that China does not emphasize, but the facts of statistics have been scattered in various books, but they are not obvious and clear.</p>
<p>The most notable of what China usually calls "statistics" is accounting. What is commonly seen in account books, from a numerical point of view, includes subtotals, totals, grand totals, cumulative totals, and separate totals. From a temporal point of view, there are daily totals, monthly totals, and annual totals. As for the term "statistics," although it seems to have become an academic term today, its form has evolved from grand totals. However, the meaning of "total" only refers to the summation and conclusion of numbers. "Statistics," on the other hand, contains the meaning of unification from division, so it is close to the meaning of "Statistic."</p>
<p>China's statistical work consists only of customs trade books, which use the changes in the quantity and value of imports and exports, as well as the gains and losses of goods in various customs and the increase or decrease in tax revenue, as statistics. Although quantity and value are also listed separately, the so-called value is only the sum of the value of goods, not individual prices. Although it is not difficult to obtain prices from quantity and value, it is only the average price for a year, and there is no way to know its trend and changes.</p>
<p>China has never failed to attach importance to the investigation of commodity prices in various places. Guanzi mentioned it, and Sang Hongyang and Liu Yan implemented it. Even in the reigns of Emperor Guangxu and other emperors of the Qing Dynasty, who suffered repeated disasters, it was known that the constant prosperity of commerce required countless preparations to be effective. After the Jiawu War (1894), which ended in defeat to Japan, more and more people talked about reforms. For example, in the memorial submitted by Censor Wang Pengyun in the 21st year of Guangxu (1895), the Ministry of Revenue also knew the importance of investigating commodity prices in various places. It said:</p>
<p>"The Censor said that establishing commercial bureaus in various provinces to protect Chinese merchants and gradually regain economic rights is an urgent task. However, please appoint special commissioners as coordinators, but it is difficult to be thorough in an industry that is managed by officials in an official capacity. It is better for the government to establish bureaus and still allow merchants to manage them in order to connect with their feelings. It is proposed that each governor-general and governor be instructed to establish a commercial bureau in the provincial capital, and have an honest, reliable, and prestigious gentry merchant be elected by the merchants to serve as the director of the bureau and handle affairs in the bureau. The bureau should comprehensively consider the profits and losses of the province's products and prices and study them in detail. The main areas involving foreign merchants are silk and tea, and recently textiles, spinning, sugar making, and paper making, self-igniting fire (note: namely, matches) and foreign soap industries. The bureau should consider their advantages and disadvantages, which can compete with foreign merchants and which can expand sales. If they can have a real vision and a firm grasp, they should be allowed to report to the governor-general and governor to promote them. Furthermore, commercial offices should be established in various prefectures, states, and counties in water and land transport hubs, and sub-directors should be elected to connect as limbs. All information on the rise and fall of commodity prices and the growth and decline of the market in various places should be reported to the provincial bureau by the sub-directors on a quarterly basis, compiled and summarized, and the annual report should be sent to the Zongli Yamen by the governor-general and governor for reference, following the format of the General Customs Trade Report."</p>
<p>The General Commercial Bureau was the predecessor of the later General Chamber of Commerce, but at that time it was appointed by officials. For example, in the 25th year of Guangxu, Liu Kunyi, the governor-general of Liangjiang, sent Zhang Sai and Liu Shiheng to Shanghai to establish a bureau, but nothing was accomplished. In September of the 34th year of Guangxu, an order was issued to establish investigation bureaus in various provinces, and the various ministries and courts would compile them and establish a statistical office, but this was only a formality. After the founding of the Republic of China, statistical investigations were never failed to be carried out, but they were all practically ineffective. It was not until 1919 that China had a formal agency for investigating commodity prices, but it was still established by the customs for collecting import duties. The collection of import duties on foreign goods in China was originally the responsibility of the Guangdong Customs. Before the opening of the five ports, the annual amount was more than 899,000 taels. At that time, the level of tariffs was determined by China's own authority. However, the main imports were opium, woolen cloth, poplin, clocks, and the like, and the exports were silk, tea, rhubarb, and so on. The tax items were simple. Later, with the opening of the five ports, there were no restrictions on the import and export of foreign goods, and the goods became more and more complex, with more and more varieties. Some were not covered by the old tariff rules, so customs officials manipulated them at will, colluding with foreign merchants to embezzle profits or levying excessive taxes, insatiably greedy, which not only reduced tax revenue but also harmed merchants. After signing commercial treaties with various countries, the door to agreed tariffs was opened, so China no longer had control, and the import of foreign goods became very convenient. Foreign merchants wanted to sell their goods in China, which was beneficial to high taxes. Once the tariff was agreed with foreigners, they would choose the commodity price that was most beneficial to themselves (that is, the low price) as the basis for taxation. If so, China's tax revenue would be reduced invisibly. Therefore, the level of commodity prices often became the focus of disputes. Since China usually did not have reports on commodity price investigations, the commodity prices used were either the prices obtained by dividing the quantity and value in the customs register or temporary investigations on the market, or requests from foreign firms, all of which could not be taken as credible and were unavoidable. In 1918, when the import tariff was revised, Cai Tinggan was in charge and reported to the Ministry of Finance that it was not only inconvenient to revise the tariff without commodity price investigations at ordinary times, but also caused many losses, so there was a proposal to establish an office in Shanghai to investigate commodity prices. In January 1919, the Ministry of Finance sent Sheng Jun, Guo Sang, and Yan Jiaozhuo to establish a resident commodity price investigation office in Shanghai, and later Jia Shiyi was also sent, with Sheng Jun in charge. Sheng was a scholar, so he approached everything with a scholarly attitude. The later achievements of the commodity price investigation office were all due to his efforts.</p>
<p>At the beginning of its establishment, the commodity price investigation office was simple and crude. At that time, Guo Sang was the director of the Shanghai Stamp Office, and the office was located in the Sixteen Paved Streets, and the commodity price office rented the remaining rooms for office work. Later, it moved to Houzai Lane on Baker Road, and then to the sixth floor of the Poplin Exchange, until it moved into the second floor of the Jianghai Customs House, which was already after being reorganized into the National Tariff Commission.</p>
<p>At that time, the industrial and commercial circles not only did not support the Ministry's dispatch of commodity price investigations, but also had covert discrimination. On the surface, they reluctantly perfunctory, but secretly they put it out of their minds. They thought that government offices did things without beginning or end, and that they could get away with it as long as they prevaricated. Moreover, the investigation of commodity prices must be for the purpose of increasing taxes. If the details of our business community are known, what business can still be done? Therefore, concealment and deception were the best policies. However, only Xiang Songmao of the Wuzhou Pharmacy and Gu Zipan of the Poplin Industry knew the importance of investigating commodity prices and wholeheartedly supported it!</p>
<p>However, with the assistance of only one or two people and the investigation of three or four people for thousands of commodities, it can be known that it is not only simple and crude, but also laborious and ineffective. Therefore, in addition to the Ministry-appointed staff, Pan Zhongjia and Guo Nan were added to take charge of the investigation. People from the industry were recruited to report market prices, and they were called investigators. At that time, although the investigators were from various industries, they did not dare to publicly take the job, fearing that they would be blamed by the people in the store. The accumulated habits of the industrial and commercial circles were still deep, and they did not want to disclose the size of the market, fearing that once it was revealed, it would be detrimental to their "monopoly" or various "manipulations."</p>
<p>The employees in the industrial and commercial circles in 1919 and 1920 were not as educated as the current young employees (it should be known that reading does not necessarily make you rich, and getting rich does not necessarily require reading, which was even more true in the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles twenty years ago), and when it came to writing market reports, they felt a great burden. Therefore, the achievements of each industry investigator at that time were mostly achieved after a considerable period of training. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Trap</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>This European war is related to the life and death of England and Germany, so both sides are full of tricks and compete for novelty. One of the methods is to set up "traps" before retreating from a place, so that the enemy will be greatly deceived.</p>
<p>For example, there is a house that is undamaged, and a basin of water is placed in the middle of the path in the garden. You lift the basin of water, and with a rumble, a landmine explodes; a picture frame on the wall of a house is hanging crookedly. You walk up and straighten it, and there is another rumble; you turn on the radio, sit in a chair, light a stove, close the window... No matter what you do, there is a danger of being greatly deceived by the enemy. Sometimes even the fresh and lovely apples growing on the trees are one of the "traps" set up by the enemy, because the apples contain poisonous juice.</p>
<p>In fact, is it only the military's expedition that is full of traps? Isn't the rugged world also like this? Especially in this brightly lit, extravagant city of Hua Du, traps are everywhere. Young people on the road of life must be cautious.</p>

<h3>Plants' Land Expansion Strategy</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>We know that "propagation" is a principle in the biological world that is more important than "maintaining one's own life." However, there is an accompanying prerequisite for plants: that is, do not gather the seeds together, so that they are crowded and lack the necessary nutrients to develop fully. So they must be scattered, they must use aggressive means to expand their territory! Now let's take a look at the various land expansion tactics that nature has given to plants.</p>
<p>Airborne</p>
<p>Among tactics, there is nothing more powerful and effective than the air force, and the land expansion capabilities that nature has given to plant seeds are also most numerous with airborne weapons. Look at the thin wings of elm and ailanthus coins, the round umbrellas of dandelion scissors, the swaying of poplar flowers in the wind, the soaring of willow catkins, and many other things that cannot be enumerated: whether they are airplanes or parachutes, which one is not a heroic and outstanding air fighter that is invincible?</p>
<p>Seafaring</p>
<p>Some plant seeds are surrounded by a layer of shell, and they themselves are like a small boat or submarine, so they can drift with the waves and "ride the long wind to break through thousands of miles of waves!" Someone picked up a coconut weighing 25 kilograms on the beach of the South Pacific Islands. After investigation, it was known that it had floated from an island northeast of Madagascar, Africa. Some people have calculated that a current rushing from the Isthmus of Panama to the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean carries 144 plant species from the mainland. All the islands in the ocean that have never been reached by humans since ancient times can also have plant reproduction, probably all from this.</p>
<p>Machine Gun</p>
<p>A peculiar cucurbitaceous plant that grows along the Mediterranean coast and northern Africa is called "squirt cucumber". When its fruit matures, it automatically separates from the fruit stalk (exactly what the ancient saying calls "when the melon is ripe, the stem falls off"), and because of a kind of irresistible high pressure hidden in itself, it can shoot seeds from the "stalk hole" to a very distant place. Isn't this a vivid machine gun?</p>
<p>Bomb</p>
<p>There are also familiar impatiens plants whose fruits can explode like "bombs". The fruit of impatiens is oblong. When it matures, the pericarp splits into five lobes, and the sudden coiling ejects the seeds in all directions. Europeans call this flower "touch-me-not" or "impatient flower," which can greatly express its bomb-like temper!</p>
<p>Strafing</p>
<p>The fruit of the poppy is like a small pot with a lid. When the seeds mature, a row of evenly arranged round holes opens around the lid; when the wind blows, the small pot sways and scatters the seeds from the round holes in all directions. Let's reluctantly call this way of scattering seeds strafing.</p>
<p>Tunnel</p>
<p>Bamboo, sugar cane, cogongrass, horsetail grass—also known as heart-breaking grass—and countless other plants use underground roots or stems to ramble and drill everywhere. Comparing this "drilling" effort to the action of digging a tunnel is probably somewhat similar.</p>
<p>Enticement</p>
<p>All fruits that contain juice and flesh are probably not going to crack open and scatter the seeds to the outside. Nature then decorates their appearance to be very beautiful, and the juice is made to be very sweet, so that people and animals see them and want to admire them, move their fingers, and eat them. As for the seeds, they are deliberately made bitter, astringent, and hard, making them inedible, so that people and animals will throw them away without saying a word, and turn their heads and ignore them. However, the plant's desire to expand its territory is completely satisfied by this taking and abandoning. This is called "enticement," and why not?</p>
<p>Rogue</p>
<p>A kind of noxious weed that grows in mountain gullies and by the roadside is called "cleavers". Its fruits have countless small hooks; another kind of noxious weed is called "field hedgehog", its fruits are oval and surrounded by sharp thorns, as if they are hedgehogs. When people and animals walk by them, these things can cling to people's clothes or animal fur and tails, forcing people and animals to do their duty as pioneers of land expansion. This kind of oil-rubbing method of completing the invasion is nameless, so it is called "rogue".</p>

<h3>A Study of Wolf Girls</h3>
<p>— Herb Name</p>
<p>In 1920, a missionary named Mr. Singh, in Midnapore, India, rescued two human girls from a wolf den. They had lived with wolves for so long that they were accustomed to a savage, beastly life, making it difficult to restore their normal humanity. Mr. Singh used his best efforts to "tame" and "civilize" them, but his efforts were not entirely successful. The younger one, named Amala, died soon after; the older one, Kamala, managed to live in a human environment for nine years, but in the end, she only learned to say fifty words, liked to wear red clothes, and could play with other children, but she was still far from the standard of a normal person.</p>
<p>This strange story aroused the curiosity of scientists. Professor Singh, an anthropologist at Denver University, believed that this was an excellent experiment to study the influence of environment on psychological development. He collected all kinds of facts about the wolf girls from Mr. Singh, analyzed and organized them thoroughly, and recently compiled them into a book. Some passages in the book are thought-provoking, and excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>"Although an infant inherits complete humanity genetically, because the human nervous system is too complex, his early years must have multifaceted contact with the human environment; otherwise, he cannot develop a healthy mind."</p>
<p>"The character and habits learned by an infant in the first two years have a great impact, almost equal to what is learned in the rest of his life. Therefore, if there is no contact with humans in the first two years, his language skills and upright posture will not be easily restored."</p>
<p>"The influence of the environment is not all-encompassing. If a young wolf or ape is brought to an orphanage to live with humans, they will not learn much about human behavior due to their innate inferiority."</p>
<h3>Looking in the Mirror</h3>
<p>— Hui Ru</p>
<p>On average, ordinary women spend ten months of their lives looking in the mirror.</p>
<p>From the ages of six to ten, they spend an average of seven minutes a day looking in the mirror.</p>
<p>From the ages of ten to fifteen, they spend fifteen minutes!</p>
<p>By the age of twenty, the average is more than one hour per day.</p>
<p>After the age of sixty, it returns to ten minutes a day. (Parade, March issue)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Bird</p>
<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>"Ah! This trouble is quite a big one! Zhao called for Yu Kun, then grabbed his sleeve with a pair of hands, one short and one fat, looking like two halves of a cactus, and went straight into Begonia's bedroom. I don't know what happened to the Third Boss in Tianjin, those bastards dared to steal all his banknotes, passbooks and several boxes of top-quality goods, at least seven or eight out of ten..."</p>
<p>No matter how much Yu Kun liked to joke and laugh, he couldn't help but change his face suddenly when he heard Zhao Si's report, and couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>"How did they know?" He groaned for a while before asking Zhao Si this question.</p>
<p>Because Zhao Si was too fat, he kept fanning himself all the way, but the sweat on his face and body still bubbled out like the Pearl Spring.</p>
<p>"This is all the trickery of that kid Ji Zhaoxiong!"</p>
<p>Yu Kun glanced at him, not quite understanding.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you slowly!" Zhao Si first used a towel soaked in cold water to wipe his face vigorously, and then said breathlessly: "On the evening of the seventh day of the lunar month, Ji Zhaoxiong, who had always been a groom in Yuan Gongguan in Tianjin, suddenly broke into here alone, first rambling with us for a while, and then took Rong Kui out to talk to him alone; the next day, Rong Kui and Jin Da Gezi discussed secretly for most of the day. I happened to go out for a while, and didn't pay much attention when I came back. Unexpectedly, they had long been ill-intentioned, and a few people didn't know how much money they pooled together, bought a lot of wine and things that I usually like to eat; Second Boss, this is indeed my Zhao Si's shortcoming, I love to eat and drink all my life...!" His round, fat face immediately revealed a very ashamed expression, fully expressing the meaning of taking the blame and blaming himself. (120)</p>
<h3>Identifying Babies by Footprints</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>Modern hospitals, in order to prevent misidentification of newborn babies, specially hang paper labels on the baby's arms or feet, indicating the baby's name, gender, weight, date of birth, mother's room number, etc., which is quite safe. Recently, there is another method, which is to identify babies by their footprints, which is said to be foolproof.</p>

<h3>A Clever Way to Test Actors</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongcheng</p>
<p>One day, Bai Leima asked Stanislavsky, a famous Soviet director, how he chose his actors. Mr. Shi picked up a pin and said, "I choose them with this." Then Mr. Shi said to Bai Leima, "Now, please go to the next room and wait a while."</p>
<p>Soon after Bai Leima went out, Stanislavsky opened his mouth and said, "Okay, now you can come in. Look for my pin!" He watched Bai Leima's every move with cold eyes.</p>
<p>At that time, Bai Leima first picked up a few glasses from the table; then rummaged through the saucers and basins, hoping to find the pin under those things. Suddenly, Bai Leima felt like there was something under the tablecloth, and sure enough, he lifted the corner of the tablecloth and immediately found the pin.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi clapped his hands and shouted, "Great, you are really capable!" The following is his explanation: "I can determine whether a person is a good actor from the way he looks for a pin. If he paced around the room, showing a look of helplessness, and pretended to be deeply thoughtful, and went to a few ridiculous (ostentatious) places to rummage around, then he must be a useless fellow."</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Briefs</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>

<p>Meng Xuxi suffered from periostitis, which festered severely. He was sent to the hospital for surgery and asked the company for a month's leave. Therefore, Meng Na's role as Mimi's mother in the Venus film "Tears Splashed on Flowers" will be assigned to someone else.</p>
<p>The four major domestic film first-run theaters simultaneously increased prices from the night show on the 27th of this month, but they did not publish a statement in advance. The new seat prices are divided into three types: one yuan and two corners, one yuan and five corners, and two yuan.</p>
<p>He Bin also plays two roles in "New Invisible Technique", one is an arrogant and reckless detective, and the other is a timid banker.</p>
<p>The famous writer Mao Dun's "Midnight", Guohua has decided to adapt it and put it on the screen, and is currently planning everything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fleck, the Western director of Minhua, has been pregnant for several months recently, so she has asked the company for leave to recuperate.</p>
<h3>Symphony of Drama and Film</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Society's current revival of "Tears Splashed on Flowers" is planned to have Xia Xia and Shen Min play the roles of Ding Xiang and Gu Xiaomei respectively, because they are also the two who performed in the film version of "Tears Splashed on Flowers". However, Shen Min needs a rest time from "Sorrowful City", and Xia Xia contracted a strange disease when filming "Tears Splashed on Flowers". She cannot eat salty things and must go to the hospital for fundamental treatment, so everyone cannot go on stage. The roles of Ding Xiang and Gu Xiaomei had to be changed to Bai Liyingzi.</p>
<p>Sun Jing, the director of "New Invisible Technique", will be able to complete all the filming within a week, so he has begun to write the script for the next issue. It is said that the story content depicts the prosperous scenery of Shanghai's surface, while interspersing the romance of a young couple. The tentative titles of the play are "Spring River Flower Moon Night" and "Shanghai Night" "Sleepless City", the title will be decided when filming in the future, and Li Lihua has been internally designated as the heroine in the play.</p>
<p>After Chen Yunshang finishes filming "Family" Wild Rose", she plans to return to her "second hometown" Hong Kong. The purpose is that when she left Hong Kong, she promised a certain film company in Hong Kong to film two films after one year. Therefore, she has to fulfill her promise. It will take about two months before she can return to Shanghai and take a vacation from the Guolian.</p>

Recently, there has even been a rumor that he "grew a pine tree".</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Book Buds</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1 The Sword Qi of Gongsun</p>
<p>Xu Jing scolded again and said she was a slut, lifted her up high, threw her in front of the bed and said, "You slut was born with licentiousness. At first, you repeatedly seduced me, but I, Xu Jing, am a great man who values ​​righteousness as much as a mountain. How can I collude with your licentiousness? After I sternly rejected you, you hated me and slandered me in front of my uncle, spitting blood on people, which is punishable. My uncle was dizzy for a while and believed your clever words and drove me away. Just think, how can I endure this grievance? I have long known the bad things you two dogs and men have done, so I came here tonight to catch you both and hand them over to my uncle to deal with, so that he can know what kind of person I, Xu Jing, am, and the ugly things in his family should be exposed and resolved." Xu Jing said these words with a serious voice and expression. He Ji was frightened and her face was as pale as earth. Hardening her scalp, she pleaded with Xu Jing, "Young Master Xu, it's all my fault. You are a generous person, please forgive me this time. If you hand us over to your uncle, will we still have a life? Young Master Xu, if you forgive us, we will never forget your great kindness." He Ji cried pitifully, full of tears, looking like a pear blossom in spring rain. Xu Jing laughed and said, "You slut, I can't forgive you. Who seduced me in the end? Or did I pick you up? I must distinguish clearly in front of my uncle. Tonight, I caught you two wild mandarin ducks. Let's see what kind of flowery words you still have to blame?" Then he tied He Ji with a belt, and connected with Sang Yiqing, just wanted to go downstairs to invite Wang Yongtai to confront everything, in order to clarify his innocence. Suddenly, he heard Wang Yongtai's coughing sound downstairs, followed by footsteps downstairs. Xu Jing couldn't help but feel a little strange, thinking that Wang Yongtai had already slept at ordinary times and didn't care about anything. Why would the old man suddenly come in the middle of the night? Did he already know about the affair between the adulterer and the adulteress? He saw that the door was closed, and quickly went over to open the door. Wang Yongtai walked into the room. Xu Jing stood respectfully on the side and called out Uncle. Wang Yongtai glanced at Xu Jing, nodded and said, "Nephew, you came just in time." He pointed to He Ji and Sang Yiqing tied on the ground and said, "Thank you, Nephew, for catching this pair of dogs and men for me." (77)</p>
