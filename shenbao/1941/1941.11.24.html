<h3 id="c28">遠東五強會議的重要性 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>中英美荷澳五國代表隔昨在華盛頓舉行重要會議，表面上是「交換情報」，實際上當然和已臨決定階段的美日談話有關。溯自美日接談以來，與太平洋時局具有直接關係的五强代表舉行全體會議，這還是第一次，其性質之重要，當然不言可喩，雖不敢說太平洋的和戰前途，已由此ABCD會議加以決定，但至少可說民治陣錢聯合對付日本的共同立塲，業經此度集議而益加確定。據英使哈里法克斯於會後表示，「與會各國已獲有完全同意，且一致支持美國在對日談話中所持的立塲」，同時扶病出席的中國大使胡適博士則於會後表示「愉快」，並堅決聲言「中國對於任何事件均不恐慌，亦更無驚懼之理由」，然則至少可以推測到美國在對日談話中的立塲，依然堅決，換句話說，即依然堅持反侵略態度。</p>
<p>和這五强會議平行的，恰巧有美日談話業已遭遇困難的傳說，同時據路透社電訊，似乎東京方面對於談話前途，亦復表示悲觀。假定美日談話業已發展到某種程度，使關係各國不得不舉行聯席會議以決定應付態度，是則無疑地，一定是談話一方對於對方所提的條件，已有分別迎拒或另提對案的正式通知。據日前電傳，赫爾曾通知來栖野村，謂「羅斯福總統絕對不能同意以東條二原則為談話基礎」，同日合衆社又發出消息，謂赫爾曾提出四項原則，卽　日本退出軸心，　停止南進北進，　自中國和越南撤退軍隊，　保證日本在太平洋區域享受經濟的均等機會。假使這兩項消息是眞的，那麼，無疑地，一定是日本已答覆赫爾，吿以在這四項原則中，至多祇能接受那幾項。姑且假定日本能够完全接受第二項，但對於第一項則表示不能公開退出軸心，而祇能對於歐戰繼續保持中立，對於第三項則表示必須美國協助解決「中國事變」，對於第四項則表示日本必須享有「特權」，這樣，表面上似乎日本已相當讓步，但按之實際，仍舊還是「欺人之談」，而把羅斯福總統當作「傻瓜」，以為用這樣的「讓步」，便可換得美國的「和平」。姑且不問華盛頓當局對於這樣的討價還價，作何感想，卽以隔昨參加會議的中英荷澳四國代表而言，恐怕也都要嗤之以鼻！良以時至今日，任何人應該認識日本早已「病入膏肓」，它所患的「擴展狂」，決不是任何外交談判或紙面協定所能壓得下去，它的「旣定國策」，早已成了歷屆內閣的一貫方針，它所等的，祇是一個「適當的機會」，無論對美成立何種妥協，它決不能信守到底，除非能使日本自動解除武裝，否則，它為內外環境所驅使，必然仍有利用未來「機會」，隨時發動新攻勢的一日。因此美國不想和日本成立協定則已，如果仍想談判出一個具體結果，以期安定遠東大局，則至少限度，必須堅持上述四項原則，因為不然的話，對遠東整個民治陣綫為不忠，對自己本身也等於是自貽伊戚，以羅斯福赫爾二公的賢明，吾人敢斷言其決不致愚鈍至此。</p>
<p>反之，就日本立塲而論，東條內閣假使把赫爾所舉出的四項原則，不折不扣，完全接受，則東條必倒，假定不接受，而又無法和美國成立折衷方案，則東條除了鋌而走險一條路之外，還是不得不以一走了之，所以為今日的東條內閣設想，假使華盛頓當局在五强會議之後，依然堅持原來立塲，絲毫不肯讓步，則這一個簇新的軍人內閣，惟有在「行動」和「辭職」二者之間，擇一而行。因為，事實上，由於上述種種理由，美國此次在對日談話中所代表的，不僅是美國一國的利益，而是遠東整個民治陣綫的利益，隔昨五强會議的召集，便是明證，然則卽以中英荷澳四國的立塲而言，也決不容美國以一個不澈底的妥協為滿足，換句話講，為整個遠東大局的安全計，美國在此次對日談話中，必然堅持日本澈底改變態度，亦卽澈底放棄侵略政策，美國決不能以各同盟國的安全，甘心去賭一個最不可靠的日本保證，因此不妨斷言日本此次茍非全部接受赫爾原則，決計再無取巧或欺矇的機會，五强會議所決定的共同立塲，正是日本投機外交的喪鐘。</p>

<p>啊呵，啊呵……</p>
<p>一位面貌淸秀服飾整潔三十左右歲的人，引長了頸子，振紅了面孔，站在人叢中左右旋動的唱着戲句。兩隻手不停的在空中擺動，又似帶拍，又似指揮。他的手下是一羣曲着背怒吼着的縴手，他們每個人走到廟的上手又轉下來，用縴板棕繩搭在剛上岩石的竹纜向前走。他們的步伐跟吼聲一樣的整齊。他們的肩背潑紫，滿身流汗，要將一艘落在下流十數丈遠的重載船拉到這灘流的中段岩脚下。船將攏岸，十數個縴手匆忙的下山岩去，跳上船，拿起竹篙工作；有的用竹篙在船頭抵蓿岩石，避免衝撞，有的用竹篙另一節的鐵鈎鈎着岩石上的洞，有的爽直向前撐。嘈雜的叫囂，忙亂的步聲，鐵鈎碰在岩石上的淸饗，與夫怒潮跟木船間的衝激，交織成另一種搏鬥的音籟。</p>
<p>岸上，呼喝者跟些縴手坐在階簷下吃米粉糕，只派了兩個人拉着岸上竹纜的一頭圈牢在八九丈遠的上流岩石上。木船漸漸離岸，船上的水手紛紛豎起槳樁，奮力橫渡急流。船被水衝激下退，鬆弛的竹纜跟着緊張起來。忽然間一陣陣銀白色浪花四向飛濺，十數把槳變得零亂急速，失去原有的韻節。這時船已行抵主流了。不久，船上的緊張頓然降低，槳數减少，又看到竹篙在空中飛舞，這邊將圈在岩石的竹纜放下，一條白龍直向對河穿去，在船舷邊隱沒。船達彼岸，慢慢划入靜靜的汶河裏，那十數位水手父跳上岸去揹縴。</p>
<p>我們的船居然給兩位縴手揹到岩脚下。我們被招呼上船，向對岸划去。離岸不久，看到廟前的一羣，幫助另一艘剛上陂的重載船夫們工作。</p>
<p>呀……呀……呀……</p>
<p>啊呵，啊呵……</p>
<p>又唱起來了。我事後探知，廟前呼唱老率領下的這批縴手，永遠的這樣工作，他們便是以「拉灘」為職業者。</p>
<p>「蜀道靴難於上靑天」這是上水客人和翻山越嶺者的感慨，如果你順流而下，心裏便不會有這樣的念頭。</p>
<p>朝辭白帝彩雲間，千里江陵一日還。</p>
<p>兩岸猿聲啼不住，輕舟巳過萬重山！</p>
<p>為着歆羨這種快意的旅行，常喜覓機搭乘下水船。</p>
<p>暑假回渝，便乘了兩段木船。標明六時開行的木船，因購票方法不良，拖延到九時始離岸，把我們這些守時刻未能多進早餐的旅客急壞了。「暫別了！樂山」，船被放進岷江主流裏去，飄飄蕩蕩，來到岷江，大渡河會口處。大渡河的怒吼，岷江的嗚咽，再加上船夫奮力推槳，船被很快的送過急流。漩渦依然不停的浮泛，可是水流緩慢得多了。我想：這是船夫們應該加力划船的地段了。那知事實却跟我的想像相反，六把槳像成對的寳劍斜挿在船舷兩旁，船夫們或坐或躺在船頭上吸烟「擺龍門陣」（談天）了。經我們扳談詢問，才領略了他們一點行下水船的理論：「推灘不推平」「慢船跑過快馬」，只要不是急流險灘，讓船兒跟水渦下去，巳經很快了，何必再性急呢？但是掌舵的船主，為了减少對旅客的伙食擔負，不時促令船夫們「推呀！「推呀」，他借着船小客衆無法造飯為口實，只管小停的開。直到下午一時許，全船搭客再不能忍耐饑渴跟排洩物膨脹的痛苦，言明飯食自理，逼迫停船，他才應允。這時船已行了一百三十餘里。（此係　里，一　里約合三分之一公里，三分之二市里。）</p>

<p>法捕房當局、為規定零售商店不得超越規定限價起見、特於昨日發貼公吿如下、「凡零售商出售各種進口貨物者、須依照當局所規定之價格、曾經外國報章刊載通吿在案、該項物價表、各零售商得向各該管捕房索取」、</p>
<p>商店五家吊銷執照</p>
<p>法租界警務處、根據統制物價章程、前日在法大馬路二五二號天利烟兌店·三〇九號恒興烟兌店·及四五二號大有生燭號·華格臬路一三三號傯興祥烟兌店·及寗興街二七四號洽源烟行、抄獲囤積之大宗肥皂、被吊銷其營業執照、其中數家、為售價超過法公董局所規定之最高限價、或為隱藏貨物、企圖抬價出售、此等行為、根據法總領事署所公布之統制物價章程、均應受嚴厲處分、可見公共租界工部局所定之零售物品限價、在法租界亦一體實施、</p>
<p>抬價商店封閉三家</p>
<p>據悉法租界內最先被當局處分之違限商店、為霞飛路六〇一號之人家藥房、該藥房於工部局公布限價之後、竟將克寗奶粉之售價、仍在限價之上出售、乃為法捕房派捕査明確實、並抄獲克寗奶粉三聽、將該店主帶至捕房、並判處停業一星期、另據平明社記者探息、法警務處除於前日將售貨超出限價之金神父路二十五號餘大祥北貨海味號、及該路四十七號豐泰罐頭食品號等、先後勒令封閉、</p>
<p>雷厲風行人心大快</p>
<p>據悉、自兩租界積極實施統制後、物價已漸趨穩定、惟有若干奸商、仍陽奉陰違、將若干商品、藏之密室、拒不照限價出售、實為常局進行管理物價之一大障碍、故兩租界當局、均布吿公衆、希望吿發投機漁利行為、在法租界方面、尤為雷厲風行、上述若干零售商號、即囤有大宗肥皂、拒不出售、或高抬售價、大有生燭號地下、且特別築有水門汀地窟、專事囤積貨物、其中以肥皂為大宗、據聞所抄獲之肥皂、將全部予以沒收、以為囤積居奇者戒、現上述被吊銷執照各店、在門上均貼有封條一紙、上印「該店出售物品、因超過限價、奉警務處命令停業」路人見者、均表示人心大快、</p>
<p>物價佈告竟敢撕毀</p>
<p>兩租界當局自着手管理物價上漲、將各種日用品價格抑平公布後、昨晨起、將所發表之貨物價格、以英文印就表格、張貼於界內各烟兌雜貨店旁之墻上、以便照表發售、惟有一般無恥店號、竟視法令如具文、將是項價目表撕去、大光社記者昨晨途經法租界敏體尼蔭路　百九十七號　福昌南貨香燭號時、見有學徒兩名、將法當局所貼於門口之價目表、用力撕去、記者上前詢問原因、該兩學徒亞無回答、至有人公然撕去當局所貼限價表、其意當為不滿當局所限定之價格、亟應加以制裁、</p>
<p>戰時統制貴乎神速</p>
<p>工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、前日對記者稱、工部局答復報上所發表之信件、尙屬初次、但余對於字林西報「致編者函」攔內所發表具名「公平」之一函、甚感興趣、願乘此機會加以論列，自工部局最近發表統制物價規定零售物之最高限價公吿以來、深知一部份零售商、必將因此遭受若干困難、但　使零售物價之規定、能翁籌並顧、使各方面均不致感受困難、則對每一零售商以前所進之貨物、必須調査其進價、若是、則對零售物價之統制、恐遷延至今日、亦仍小能付諸實行、査零售商之過分投機牟利、已成公開之秘密、工部局為公衆利益計、唯有不顧一部份人之困難、而迅速實行統制物價、蓋戰時經濟一旦實行統制之時、一部份人遭遇困難、勢所難免、故余更願乘此機會、提及工部局所收到若十人關於嚴厲實施最高限價因遲緩而引起之不滿、</p>
<p>公佈限價均經詳核</p>
<p>按統制物價之實施、茲事體大、非倉猝間所能竣事、故工部局認為此項措施、必須逐步實行、余希望贊成統制物價一舉之人士、尙須忍耐從事、須知發表各種零售物之最高限價、必須由工部局或與工部局合作之各業公會、予以詳盡之調査、否則結果徒有弊而無利、蓋過早之發表、非但有欠公允、且或反足以引起不必要之漲價、工部局　正盡其最大之努力、擴充其統制物價之機構、而儘速付諸實施、甚望公衆對工部局抱忍耐與合作之精神、凡有積極性之建議、在所歡迎、</p>

<p>— 兪斌</p>
<p>經消部部長翁文灝博士，係著名地質學家兼冶金學家，在翁氏領導之下，中國工程師一萬名，現正從事服務於有關戰事之工業及其他工業；交通事業，鑛業，冶金，及自由中國之建設事業。</p>
<p>敎育部部長陳立夫氏，曾在美國本雪文尼亞省之畢資堡大學，得有工程科博士學位。在陳氏訓導之下，正有靑年學子數千名，求學於各大學及專科學院，以便造成為工程師。自由中國深知工程師之地位，對於戰事工業及建設事業之重要，而工程師並不負所期望。</p>
<p>在中國五千年歷史過程中，農業國家之生活，工程師已盡其最大之責任。故大禹有被稱為中國水力工程師。今日，建造運河及河隄，以利灌溉，濬浚河道及測量水道，工程師是必不可少的。</p>
<p>中國現代工程師，因鑒於遜演遲滯於改良當時之軍備，以成近代化者，故皆為軍械專家。近數年以來，軍械工程師，已經增有大批從事工程科，化學科，及物理科畢業之學生，並皆在軍政部所設之軍需品學校受有相當高等訓練。</p>
<p>軍興以前，航空工業，甚形幼稚，四年以來，經各科工程師不斷努力，除國有航空工廠外，已完成非數年不為功之偉績。化學及土木工程師，對於空襲戒備，亦已盡最大之努力。</p>
<p>軍事，土木及　信工程師，除服務於兵工廠及航空工廠者外，對於有關戰事之職務，亦甚形活躍。現正服務於機械化部隊之指導工程師及高級機械工程師，實寄有形成現代化軍隊之希望者。</p>
<p>工廠西移成功，證明為中國工程師之努力，以應付非常時期。機械工廠，於抵達目的地後，在　三星期內復工者，則當推其主任工程師之勞績。除造軍械零件外，並從事於農工用具之製造及發電機與其他機器。化學工業適用之發電機及機器，皆在戰爭情形下，用極簡單工具製造者。因之，使中國工程師，對於成功之道，信念愈堅。</p>
<p>汽車工程師，對於汽油汽車，已能加以改良，而使用木炭，酒精，桐油，及其他植物油。同時，化學家已完成製造酒精，提鍊桐油，蒸溜烟煤及壓縮煤氣。大部工業之成功，實因戰事之需要及中國工程師之天才。</p>
<p>礦業工程師，利用遷入內地之機器，並改良之土法，開採煤鑛，鐵鑛，金鑛，銷鑛，錫鑛，銻鑛，汞鑛，銀鑛，銅鑛，及其他鑛產。冶金學家担任溶化及提鍊之責。土木工程師建造鐵路，公路，飛機塲，橋樑及屋宇工程。六百公里已完成之鐵路，建造中數百公里之鐵路，五千公里已完成之公路及正在建造中四千九百公里之公路，皆足證明為若輩努力下之收穫。</p>
<p>戰事工業通用之新發電站，利用蒸氣或水力者，巳建造完成，以便供給電力。電氣工程師，已立下了　個基礎，使西北及西南電氣化，其豐功偉績，非戰前所可比擬。</p>
<p>紡織工程師管理華西之新式棉織工廠及毛織工廠，此在戰前，祗陝西有新式棉織工廠一所。紡織業之中心，現集中於四川，甘肅，雲南，廣西及廣東。</p>
<p>化學工程師，現正從事於漂白猪　，繅絲，提鍊桐油，熔製茶葉及其他農產品，以便出口。工程師之從事保藏食物及裝聽工作者，對於軍民，甚形重要。</p>
<p>軍興前所購之機器，留而未用者，皆已加以利用。一世紀前所應用之土法，現已加以改良，以補機械產品之不足。學者在戰前所學得之理論，已進於實用之階段，大半已從理論家進為實用家矣。</p>

<p>— 彭逸鵬</p>
<p>分配所以促進生產　貫澈階級鬥爭特性</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰中，帝俄政府鑒於國內物資恐慌之深重，亦曾仿效德國辦法，實施特種物品之分配券制度，然此類分配券之發行，並未與物品之實際供給量相配合，故常有不兌現之病態發現，國民對於分配券之信用，完全失墜。</p>
<p>十月革命成功，蘇聯政府繼之而起，一面宣佈土地，金融機關，大產業，船舶等之收歸國有；一面毀棄貨幣經濟之法則，實施生產工具之强制徵發，勞力之徽用，而用分配券以辦理分配之統一制度。全蘇聯人民受同一配給量，無分勤惰。由於勤惰待遇之相等，乃造成普遍之怠工狀態，從而發生物資供給不足，黑交易橫行等饑饉現象，直至推行新經濟政策，方逐漸克服及進入產業五年計劃之空前大事業之開始，蘇聯國內之經濟狀態，已大形改善。方今堪與德國一角雌雄者，實係蘇聯朝野過去努力之結果也。</p>
<p>蘇聯過去之努力，歷經千辛萬苦；如初期之國內戰亂，列强之圍攻，國內物資恐慌，物價奔騰，紙幣泛濫等等；其間蘇聯人民之日常消費生活之得以經歷如此許多之難關，不能不歸功於蘇聯政府之增產政策及分配券政策。方今舉世戰亂，消費統制盛行，又莫不注意於分配券制度之施行時，一觀蘇聯過去之分配券制度，似非無意義之事。</p>
<p>分配券制度之起用，乃以物資不足為背景，而一時又未易使其供給之增加。於是不得不就所有者，作適當之分配，以求享受之均等，而防少數人之獨占，及不當之浪費。以求社會全體之生活維持；唯社會全體生活之維持，方可以言從增產中克服物資供給不足之根本病態。</p>
<p>蘇聯推行第一次五年計劃時代，對於物資供給不足之對策，係採行分配券制度。並從分發分配券同時，即注入鼓勵增產之作用。當時根據所謂「階級性及衝動性之原則下，將食料，衣料等分配量及分配價格，隨對於社會提供勞力價値之多少，而作不同之分配。於是一般對社會生產毫無貢獻之僧侶及一般坐食之有產階級，均不得享受分配券。因分配券之發放，隨提供勞力而給與；故有勞力券之稱。此種分配券計有二種。第一種內又分AB二式。A式給與工廠工人，B式給與一般勞働者。第二種則分發與一般非工資收入者；至於商人，儈侶及無公權之人，則不與之。至於工廠，官廳，軍隊，學校，俱樂部等等，則設特殊之分配機關，作特殊的分配方法。</p>
<p>在此種辦法之下，一般不獲分配券之商人，富農，僧侶等人物，乃不得不以高價購取物資。於是當時之蘇聯國內的商品市塲，分成三種物價。第一種是使用分配券之標準物價巿塲，此外二種，即使用貨幣購買之營利價格巿塲，及巿塲價格市塲。所謂營利價格巿塲，由國營商品經營商品交易時所用；所謂市塲價格，係個人商店經營商品賣買之價格，蘇聯政府認為無分配券之不勞而食者，理應出最貴之價格取得其生活條件；如以其勞力提供於社會，即可取得分配券之低廉物品。此利不同之待遇，果由於其階級觀念，然亦深寓獎勵勞慟鼓勵生產之重大意義。</p>
<p>惟巿塲上旣有貴賤懸殊之三種不同價格的存在，於是分配券之非法的使用，勢所難免。蘇聯政府為防止分配券之惡用，乃逐漸提高其定價以謀遏止其流弊。加以當時力行生產而促成之財政膨脹，對於巿塲物價，自有重大刺激。惟由於增產政策之逐漸成功，物資供給已大形增加，故由一九三五年起，廢止麵包及各種商品分配券制度，而一律依營利價格分配之。之前，蘇聯政府已逐漸將標準價格與營利價格之差額，遂漸加以軋近。故將分配券之停止，對於民間並未因之而發生紛擾。</p>
<p>蘇聯之此種分配券制度，與今日德國實施之分配券制度，顯有重大之不同。扼耍言之</p>
<p>蘇聯依階級觀點而決定商品之價格及分配量等，德國則依人民之生理狀態而作不等之規定。</p>
<p>蘇聯之分配券一律肥名式，限於指定之商店；買賣雙方均規定，不可分離。德國除記名式外，亦有無記名式，無記名式者得向任何商店購取。</p>
<p>蘇聯許可在分配券以外之手段，購取物資；德國則不可。凡用分配券之特定商品，除分配券交易外，不得再作其他交易。</p>
<p>蘇聯放任黑交易與黑巿價格之存在，旨在使有資者繳出其財富，以歸之社會。德國對黑市塲則嚴禁之。</p>
<p>故蘇聯之分配券，可謂之階級主義；德國之分配券制，可謂之全體主義，蘇聯之分配券制度，具積極之增產作用；德國之分配券制，則基於物資供給而施之消極的均等分配的</p>
<h3 id="c59">英國之分配券制 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 余彬然</p>
<p>人民與國王受同一待遇家庭婦女協力貢獻至多</p>
<p>今年四月十五日，英國糧食部長王爾德申言此後三個月內糧食供給之困難，以警告其人民。作用顯在加緊其糧食確保政策之實施，故繼之即强制收用一切空閑土地栽種糧食品，違令者即以二十五鎊之代價强制收買。並非英國之糧食問題，當時</p>
<p>英國對於糧食品之消費，由一九三九年十月八日起，巳實施特別許可證制度。實施範圍為牛肉，罐頭食物，乳酪製品，穀類等。並徵發人造牛油及小麥等，同時又以開戰前一週之平均物價為限價標準，禁止越價交易。此際已顯示英國戰時消費統制政策之主體有三：即　實行定量分配券制；　必要時實行徵發制度以為公賣制之後盾；　停止物價上漲，實行限價制度</p>
<p>業巳實施定量分配券制之重要消費品，以牛油，Baeeon砂糖，肉類，咖啡，罐頭食品，臘腸，野菜，牛乳，鷄卵，食油，紅茶等二十餘種為主。去年初規定每人每週只能食用牛油與Baeeon各四盎司，砂糖十二盎司，全國一律，即國王與各王族亦受此同一限制。至去年底及今年初起，下列七種必需品之分配量又酌需减少；故至今每人每週限購鮮肉一先令二便士（以前可購二先令六便士），砂糖八盎司，牛油及人造牛油共六盎司，Baeeon五盎司，食用油及果醬各二盎司；對於旅館業等之購用量，則另有規定。</p>
<p>貿易統制與管理進口品類別之政策，於英國必需品消費統制上所表現之作用，亦至為重大。因英國為島國，島國物資供給，部份由國內出產外，大部仰給海外運入。由於運輸能力之節約計，非必需品之輸入理應予以禁限，以便騰出貨輪噸位，載運必需品之進口。如生絲，絲織品類，於一九三九年十月初即實施輸入許可制：同年十一月起擴及毛絨類；一九四〇年初又擴及紙類，同年四月又擴及棉花，人造絲造品，麻製品等等。反顧上海今日公佈之限價商品，所謂「必需」，其意義至感離奇。非但不切於華人悄費，且未必全為外人所必需。在輪舶噸位旣極有限之今日，此項「必需品」之進口是否「必需」，以英本國內所行之進口許可制範圍比較之，殊堪玩味也。</p>
<p>英國戰時消費統制政策，輔以一積極之增產政策，且巳奏極大之神效。如馬鈴薯之自給率巳增為九六％，肉類之自給率亦增為四八％，小麥，麥粉，果實，砂糖，果醬之自給率均巳增至二三％左右，對戰前均有極大之增進。英本國內過去本多庭院閑地，獵塲園林等等，今均在政府之強制墾殖及獎勵開發的政策下，用作糧食品之耕地。上述糧食品自給率之提高，即係此項政策之貢獻。</p>
<p>在英國戰時消費統制政策之執行中，英國各階層間之家庭婦女的協力，作用尤為重大。誠以人民之日常物質消費生活，均由婦人之策劉與主持。家庭婦人能深明大義，協助當局之進行消費節約與分配制度，自又事半而功倍。</p>
<h3 id="c60">德國之分配券 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 范貫吾</p>
<p>—票面五顏六色—　—分別男女老幼—</p>
<p>分配證制度是今日德國戰時消費統制中的主體政策，在開戰同時就付之實施。</p>
<p>一九三九年對波開戰後三個星期，國民購買糧食就須領用許可證。這種許可證分六種，有六種顏色：　麵包券（紅色）；麵包及麵粉。　肉券（淡青色）；畜肉類。　牛乳券（綠色）；牛乳類。　脂肪券（黃色）；白塔油，食用油等。　砂糖券（白色）；砂糖類。　食糧券（玫瑰色）；麥片，米，麺，馬鈴薯，雞卵，咖啡，調味品，澱粉，甜料。</p>
<p>這種許可證分兩種方式：一種像附有債　單的公債票一般，領購商品時像領支公債息時剪下本期息票般，剪下一角持往領購。另一種就像上海慈善團體發行的施粥票，飯票般一樣，一紙使用一次，前者實施於麵包，食糧等。票面證明使用人的姓名，住所，購用數量等，並有地域上的限制，在規定區域之外無效。以上就個人發給，對醫院，學校等另有團體票。就使用者分別有　普通消費者購買券　重工業勞働者購買券　特殊工業勞働者購買券　六歲以下孩童用券　十四歲下兒童用券。連一般農民及上列物品之生產者和販賣商，都應先陳報其存貨及生產估計量後，凡自用其出品時亦須使用定量的消費券。在其定量之外的出品和存貨，都不可都用而必須出售之。藉以防止囤積居奇的流弊。</p>
<p>上面是分配的形式，至於分配量是依年齡性別與職業別而分別規定，並且逐期降。他第二期的規定量是</p>
<p>普通消費者每人每週的領購量：　肉類（五〇〇格蘭姆：麵包類（二四〇格蘭姆）；脂肪（二六八·八五格蘭姆）；砂糖（二五〇格蘭姆）。</p>
<p>重工業工人每人每週的領購量：　肉類（一千格蘭姆）；麵包類（三千八百格蘭姆）；脂肪（三九三·七五格蘭姆）；砂糖（同上）。</p>
<p>特殊工業工人每人每週的領購量：　肉類（一二〇〇格蘭姆）；麵包類（四八〇〇格蘭姆）；脂肪（七四〇格蘭姆）；砂糖類（同上）。</p>
<p>糧食消費的領券辦法，上屆歐戰中已有實行。這次德國除糧食外，對衣服鞋帽也用領券辦法，這是空前的。一九三九年十一月起一年間，德人只許購用被服券一百分，每種衣着品都規定不同的分數。如男子方面，衣服每套六十分，襪子一雙六分，內衣上下一色，依種類而分占二十七分至三十五分。因之每個德國男子，每年只許穿一套外衣，一套內衣，一雙襪子，因為有此三種已達一百分了。至於女子的服飾，是優待的。大概國社黨人也討厭黃臉婆的。所以女裝每套四十五分，襪子每雙四分，目許一年穿六雙；最初四雙各四分，以後二雙則各八分。此外奶罩四分，手套五分，圍巾五分，手帕一分，內衣十分，短裙十二分，短衫十五分等等，都有規定。這種被服券，按性別年齡異其彩色：　二歲及三歲者，玫瑰色；　三歲至十四歲，男孩綠色，女孩青色；　十四歲以上，男用黃色，女用橙色。去年四月起，略加改正。最大的修改，大人從一百分增為一五〇分，幼童從七〇分增為一七〇分，嬰孩增為六〇分。這並不是供給量增加的結果，乃係過去限制太嚴，不得不放寬些。</p>

<p>— 無為</p>
<p>感謝兩租界當局以斷然處置的手段，實行日用必需品零售物價統制。這種步驟如能早日實現，市民所受奸商們抬價的剝削，當然還可以少些。不過話雖如此，做任何一件事總有許多週折和阻碍，何况統制物價，少自幾角幾分，多至數十百元的東西，要一樣樣的調査起來，把合理的價格標上去，却也是件眞够麻煩的事呢！</p>
<p>有價無貨，這是物價統制實行後的第一個現象。一個朋友想買五磅裝的好XX麥精乳粉。一連打聽了十幾家百貨公司和藥房，都回絕說「早就賣光了。」實則，據內行們說，這種貨品來源固然缺乏，可是應付零售的需要，還不至於有這樣的奇俏。聽說這東西最貴的時候，要買到一百二十元，現在的限價為六十七元，一進一出之間，無怪要「十叩柴扉九不開」了</p>
<p>這話結果沒有錯，那位朋友終究託了熟人，照工部局限價買到了一瓶。論這種東西，本也不是一般人所必需的，可是老弱幼童和病人等，代乳粉之類却也少不得。希望有貨的賢明商家們，對於任何東西，不要把利潤看得太重。誠如工部局所說，大家總要為公衆利益着想，庶幾淸夜捫心，無愧衾影呢。</p>

<p>「屋蠧」們剝削居民的罪大惡極，比之「貨蠹」們也有過之而無不及，幾年以來，他們在「奇貨可居」的情形之下，祇知向三房客不停的敲詐剝削。至如李珍之君向社會人士訴說的「房租要以美金計算」，更屬荒謬已極的事，令人髮指。而三房客呢，在「此外無處容身」的情形之下，有苦無處訴，也祇好聽憑剝削，忍痛度日。「貨蠹」和「屋蠹」旣同為剝削居民的蟊賊，今「貨蠧」已由當局下令施以制裁，銷聲匿跡，不敢妄為，「屋蠹」也有同樣施以制裁的必要。因此我不禁要代全市絕大多數的三房客，向兩租界當局籲請迅即下制裁「屋蠧」之令，以安居民生活，而竟全功。</p>
<p>希望兩租界當局即行下令業主及承租人將房租自動為合理之减低，如有希圖不當得利之事，一經査出或經房客吿發，即行拘捕「屋蠧」，依法嚴懲，或取消其賃租權，或並驅逐出境。</p>
<p>規定嗣後業主（大房東）如擬向承租人（二房東）加租，須向主管當局申請核准，不得擅自增加。</p>
<p>規定承租人將餘屋轉租於三房客，應視房間地位之優劣，按照付與業主租金以及水電房捐修理費等項數額比例攤派一定之租金，但所收房租總額，不得超過上述租費以及合理利益之總額，承租人自住之房間應有一定之限制，否則如佔地位過大，於攤派租金時，亦應攤派相當數目。</p>
<p>三房客如認所負租金過高者，即可根據工部局吿示要求二房東為合理之减低。如二房東拒絕時，可向當局吿發强制减低，或依法懲辦。</p>
<p>三房客對於二房東應有之利益亦應尊重，不能提出無理之要求。</p>
<p>最後，我得聲明一句，二房東中也不乏深明大義的，他們自不在本文所指之中。</p>

<p>— 益</p>
<p>慈母的愛，本來是世界上最純摯而偉大的。一個母親，把整個的心去愛子女，實行敎養的工作，有許多成功的人物，都是由他們的母愛和母敎造就的。</p>
<p>在美國德克薩斯州的福德利斯地方，有一所兒童救助社（Texas　Children's　Home　And　Aid　Society）是一個純粹的慈幼機關。這一個名聞全美的機關，是由一個偉大的女性愛娜·葛萊台夫人（Edna　Gladney）所創辦，至今她依舊繼續着她偉大而神聖的工作。</p>
<p>為着紀念她的豐功偉績起見，米高梅影片公司，特地攝成了一本五彩的影片「慈母心腸」而把牠貢獻給這　個偉大的女性。</p>
<p>這一部影片，由葛麗亞嘉遜和華爾德畢勤主演，叙述愛娜·葛萊台夫人嫁前的結婚準備，結婚後葛萊台先生所享受美滿的家庭生活。然而當她僅有的兒子在某一個聖誕節日墮車隕命以後，就過着寂寞的光陰。在某一個結婚紀念日的晚上，有一個麥醫生帶領着一個孩子到她的家裏，希望收留一夜，起先她是拒絕的，但後來忽然感覺到扶育兒童，是一件很有價値的工作，因此就在家裏創辦一個托兒所。</p>
<p>她曾遭遇到丈夫的破產和死亡，市政當局的不合作等痛苦和阻撓，但她並不灰心，到美國每一洲每一個城市每一個家庭去募捐，結果造成了那所德克薩斯洲的兒童救助社，領養兒童，為他們選擇適當的父母，使他們享受人類應享的幸福和權利。</p>
<p>她認為每一個兒童，誕生到這個世界上來，就成為人類的一份子，應該和所有的人類一般，決不能因為沒有父母而被人歧視。她又認為如果這個世界上的人類，有更好的友愛，更好的了解，那末人生將更為美麗。</p>
<p>這的確是一部優秀而具有極大的意義的影片，而影片本身的編製上有生動的故事，幽默的穿揷，動人的表演，綺麗的色彩，處處能够打動我們的心，使我們了解母愛的確是最可貴的，無論從娛樂的觀點或人生的意義上着想，我們很値得去欣賞這一部影片，尤其是許多母親們。</p>
<p>因為這部影片的崇高的價値，大華影戲院的當局，特將第一塲座券的收入，不除開支，全數捐助給三個慈善機關，第一個是上海兒童保育會，他們的工作，分為報童學校，保育院和惠樂園三個部份。第二個是上海兒童醫院，在莫利愛路五十一號，一年來住院的病童在一千名以上，而門診在一萬名以上。第三個是上海平民婦孺醫院。自從二十七年六月到今年五月，共接生二千五百五十二次，門診二萬一千三百七十一次，而產婦死亡率為千分之三，成績優異，不下於世界任何婦孺醫院，這三個機關的經濟來源，大都是由於社會上熱心的人士所捐助的。</p>
<p>在慈母心陽獻映之前，本刋特向讀者熱誠介紹這一部影片，希望社會對於慈幼工作，有更進一層的同情和合作，而對於兒童的扶育，有更大的興趣和更積極的實行。</p>

<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3 id="c66">徵文揭曉之八　鄕下妻子 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 淇</p>
<p>我由父母之命，媒妁之言，娶了一位鄕下大姑娘做妻子。那時我還祇十七歲，她小我一歲。</p>
<p>她旣是個目不識丁的文肓，又是封建時代的信徒。她崇尙迷信，憧憬富貴，待我回到亭子間裏，她便嘮叨着東家長，西家短，說某家男人月薪大，福氣好；再有便是柴米沒有了等話。簡直　些沒有安慰辛苦了一天的丈夫的話。我如果有些話，她便哭哭啼啼了，聲音可以幾個鐘頭不停，閙得人家都知道，讓前樓，擱樓，後樓的無知女人轟來瞧熱鬧。還有打小孩，也是她常有的事，有時是出氣，有時是算管敎的。有　個孩子，一個七歲，一個巳八歲子，放學回家後，功課上有什麽不懂的地方，雖然是極簡單的，也只得等我回來解決，我在夜裏要寫些字的，因此使我更見得手忙脚亂。她呢，只會講故事，不是迷信的便是關於妖怪的。有朋友到我家裏，這朋友是男的，他帶個嘲笑回去，若是女的，妻子會和我吵幾個黃昏。逢星期　出去消遣，我和她沒有投機的話可說，我歡喜看有意義的電影，她却老要去聽申曲，越劇；什麽才子佳人的故事，誘人眼淚的慘劇。我如果有業務上不能解決的問題時，我只能忍着不說。</p>
<p>她的好處也有　勤儉耐勞，不抽烟，不打牌。但是我怎能滿足於此區區呢。我需要有一個有正當職業的女子，和我有同等年齡，程度，性格，志趣。使我倆能各自謀獨立生活，共同享人生樂趣。閒時和我硏究學問，討論時事等。</p>
<p>天啊！我現在正有這樣的一位女同事，她的一切有關係狀况，我都調查淸楚，她也勤儉耐勞，無不良嗜好，因為我巳從天天和她同事的時間裏，看她服飾，辦事能力便知曉了。她和我感情很好，因此我常想和那無知的鄕女離婚，但我又常為我的理智所不許，我很悔恨當初為什麽和這種女子結婚。我現在還祇　十六歲，相信長此下去，總不是一個了局。我對於這不滿意家庭，或許有分裂的一天，啊！我害怕，我不知向所適從？</p>
<p>編者按：洪君的家庭問題，我認為洪君自己，應該負一部份的責任。一個未曾受過敎育的女子，舉動方面，常會有失當的地方，然而這不是她　身的錯誤，而也許是她的父母躭誤的，淇君應該給予她以同情，而負起敎導她的責任，使她知道怎樣纔是正當的方法。你愛看有意義的影片，再好沒有，你可以帶她去看幾回而耐心地解釋給她聽，使她感覺興趣，她愛看地方戲，你也不妨同去看幾次，要使結婚生活美滿，決不能各執一見，而需要互相的諒解和合作的。</p>
<p>請別輕視勤儉耐勞的美德，她能彀不抽烟，不打牌，可以說是很難能可貴的，而你所希望有正當職業的女子來做你的妻子，事實上也不會給予你以完滿的生活，當父母同時出去做事的時候，家事就沒有人去顧問而你的兩個孩子，還有誰可以去當心他們呢？</p>
<p>為了缺少一點敎育而想和你的妻子離婚而屬意於你的女同事，實在是一個危險的思想，你不能專顧自己的幸福，你也得顧到你妻子的幸福，你的孩子的幸福，和你的女同事的幸福。</p>
<p>為着不滿意目前的環境而煩惱的是一個很平凡的人，請記住，唯有能彀創造一種新的家庭生活，新的優美環境的，纔是一個偉大的男性，家庭中的英雄。</p>

<p>Chongqing: The National Political Council will continue to hold a review meeting today. There will be no general meeting on the 23rd. Various groups will continue to hold review meetings in the morning to continue reviewing proposals. The previous government's transportation report was not reported to the general meeting because (the highway part) was already under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission's Transportation Control Bureau. Yesterday, the bureau specially sent Chief Pang Xuesui to the Finance and Economics Group review meeting to report on the recent written report on highway transportation and facilities for review. Because the Finance and Economics Group had many proposals, a review meeting was specially added at 7:00 pm on the 23rd to rush the review of proposals and submit them to the general discussion. Chairman Lin hosted a tea party for all councilors at the National Government at 4:00 pm on the 23rd, and invited government officials to participate. The chairman extended his condolences to the councilors who came from afar to attend the meeting and worked hard for several days. Finally, Zuo Shunsheng, the chairman of the Presidium of the National Political Council, gave a speech, and the party ended in joy. At 7:30 pm, the New Transport Association held a welcome meeting for the councilors, and Huang, the general manager of the association, gave a welcome speech, and invited students from Xin Fan Elementary School to perform songs and dances, and sports performances, and screened films produced by the Central Film Studio to entertain the guests.

Regarding international and diplomatic affairs, there were questions such as: 1. What is the actual situation of the combination of the ABCD democratic front, and to what stage has it recently developed? 2.

What are the methods for dividing economic zones? 3. Technical employees are paid too low. How can this be remedied? Regarding internal affairs, there were questions such as: 1. How to speed up the implementation of the new county system and how to improve the selection of county magistrates? 2. After the implementation of the new county system, what are the methods for establishing county councils? 1. There are many abuses in the adoption of the merchant-designated system for grain. Are there any plans to improve it? 2. Will the government conduct a precise investigation of grain-deficient provinces and find ways to remedy them? Regarding education and culture, there were questions such as: Guizhou lacks teachers, and student loans are sometimes delayed. It is heard that the national education funds in the national budget for the 31st year have been reduced this year, and the case of changing the principals of central schools and national schools to full-time positions has not been thoroughly implemented. How will the Ministry of Education remedy this? (Telegraph from the 23rd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The Daily News published prominently today a special dispatch from Guangzhou, saying that the United States is using Chinese labor to build an air base in Longyan, Fujian Province, in preparation for a possible war between Japan and the United States. Longyan is across from Taiwan and is an ideal base for fighting Japan. The Daily News said that five of the latest US fighter planes and four bombers arrived in Chongqing on November 5 to test the base. Major General Magruder, the leader of the US military delegation, will soon go to Fujian to investigate whether the base can be used to fight Japan. (United Press, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e12">It is Rumored that Germany Plans to Convene a Conference of European Countries to Formulate Economic Revival Procedures, Excluding Britain from the Outside <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd: White House Secretary O'Leary told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt had received confirmed news that Germany planned to convene a conference of European countries at the end of this year and the beginning of next year to discuss the establishment of a new European order with various countries as its puppets, and said that news from German diplomatic circles indicated that Germany, because it had sacrificed too much in the war against the Soviet Union, was preparing for this conference. O'Leary also said that the purpose advocated by Germany was to use noble words such as economic revival and the restoration of freedom to various countries, but what it actually built was nothing more than a group of puppet countries controlled by Germany behind the scenes. O'Leary also said that the message received by the President was that the Germans had submitted notifications to various Axis powers, belligerent countries, and neutral countries, except for Britain. O'Leary also said that all those who believe in democracy and resist the warlord control of Europe and the world should be fully aware of the nature of this conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: White House Secretary O'Leary told reporters that the White House had learned from undisclosed sources that Germany was now planning to convene a conference to formulate procedures for the economic revival and independent restoration of European countries, and that the list of countries it intended to invite to the meeting did not include Britain. People who truly believe in democracy and oppose military rule that divides Europe and the world should not lightly believe in this plan. When asked whether Germany wanted to propose an economic peace, O'Leary did not answer directly, but said that President Roosevelt and the State Department had received intelligence that Germany intended to convene a conference. O'Leary also said that the meeting was planned to be held in December or January, at a time deemed appropriate by Germany. Among those whom Germany intended to invite to the meeting were some belligerent countries, all Axis powers, and some neutral countries.</p>

<p>United Press, New York, 23rd: Rome Radio reported last night that Mussolini will attend a meeting between General Petain and Hitler, which will be held in France in the near future. French reports said that Marshal Petain and Associate Darlan will meet with Air Force Commander-in-Chief Goering next week, but said that Hitler is expected not to attend the meeting. European reports said that the meeting was convened by Germany to request France to allow the dispatch of German troops to Africa, fearing that it would further allow Germany to use the French fleet to strengthen German-French cooperation.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said recently that whether the rumored meeting between French Marshal Petain's cabinet associate Darlan and Aviation Minister Goering in the occupied areas of France is true will be proven by facts. However, since the dismissal of General Weygand, Commissioner for French Overseas Territories in Africa, whether new factors have arisen in Franco-German relations is a question that cannot be answered at this time. According to political figures here, the French government has been criticized by foreign governments for exercising its sovereignty within the scope of the armistice agreement, but the United States is not motivated by humanitarian or political motives, but harbors ulterior motives. Whether the United States will take further blockade measures or even seize French territories is still difficult to judge at this time.</p>
<p>US-French Relations Are Hanging by a Thread</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: According to well-informed sources here, the State Department's reaction to Weygand's dismissal may not be the US's early recognition of General de Gaulle, the leader of Free France. The United States is very disappointed with the developments in French North Africa, because this development is a blow to the US policy towards French North Africa. However, according to well-informed sources, the United States may not immediately sever relations with Vichy, especially while Petain is still the French head of state and the United States has not yet severed relations with Berlin. If the United States breaks off relations with Germany, Franco-American relations will naturally break down.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: The Policy Committee of the United Mine Workers of America has advocated that coal miners should resume work immediately to await the outcome of the arbitration of the steel company's coal mine dispute. Thus, the US coal mine strike has come to an end. President Roosevelt immediately appointed Steelyman, Director of the Labor Department's Mediation Service, as the public representative, Ferris, Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Steel, as the employer representative, and Lewis, the leader of the Mine Workers Union, as the labor representative, so that the meeting of the three-person arbitration panel could be held immediately.

<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd – US Secretary of State Hull, Japanese Ambassador Nomura, and Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu met at Hull's residence yesterday afternoon for three hours. Subsequently, according to State Department officials, there were no special new developments. Continued talks are expected to be held early next week. Nomura and Kurusu made no comments on the talks.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd – Among the major Pacific nations – the United States, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies – as the Tokyo government attempts to decide whether to continue the negotiations initiated by its special envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura here, a terrible warning has been issued to Japan, implying that these four nations have united to resist further Japanese aggression. The ABCD powers have unanimously agreed to fully support the United States' position in the recent negotiations with Japan, and it is generally believed that Secretary of State Hull must have informed the two Japanese envoys of this situation during an informal meeting at his residence last night. The meeting of the ABCD powers yesterday is widely seen as delivering the following three points to Japan: Most nations are determined to maintain their interests in the Far East; To protect these interests, most nations firmly support US leadership; All nations will continue to impose economic sanctions on Japan until Japan demonstrates a more conciliatory attitude. After the meeting, Australian Minister Casey immediately declared, "There are absolutely no cracks among the ABCD powers that Japan believes are encircling it."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd – US-Japan negotiations to decide on "peace or war" reached a critical stage yesterday. US Secretary of State Hull has held meetings with the diplomatic envoys of major countries involved in the negotiations. Attendees included British Ambassador Halifax, Dutch Minister Loudon, Australian Minister Casey, and Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih. The British, Australian, Dutch, and American diplomatic envoys met for about two hours before Hull invited Dr. Hu Shih to join the meeting. Hull then temporarily left the meeting room to meet with South American Minister Crous, who had been scheduled in advance. According to a State Department spokesperson, the meeting was purely for the "exchange of information." However, it is noteworthy that although Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih had recently recovered from an illness, Mr. Hull urged Dr. Hu to attend the meeting. Everyone in attendance thoroughly discussed the situation in the Far East yesterday. Mr. Hull apparently informed the diplomatic representatives of the progress of the US-Japan negotiations. It is reported that the reason for the negotiations is due to reports of further Japanese military actions in Vietnam and the possibility of a Japanese attack on Thailand. At the same time, a report from Bangkok stated that Thailand is implementing mobilization in a state of peace. Some quarters here speculate that the Vietnam issue is related to the Washington negotiations. Some believe that Japan is preparing to take action to strengthen the position of those attending the negotiations here. Others believe that Japanese military personnel are attempting to prevent any possibility of reconciliation with the United States, and are therefore taking unhurried steps to embarrass Japanese politicians.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd – Important nations in the Pacific, including China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, held a meeting with Hull yesterday and all agreed to support the United States' position in the recent negotiations with Japan. After the meeting, British Ambassador Halifax said, "We are all in unanimous agreement with Mr. Hull's handling of the situation." Mr. Halifax also said, "The ABCD nations have complete confidence in Mr. Hull's handling of the situation." He also confirmed that the US Secretary of State had informed the ABCD nations of the progress of the negotiations. When asked if there was hope of resolving the Pacific problem, Lord Halifax smiled and replied, "I have always been an optimist, but I do not underestimate or overestimate developments." He also said, "I believe that exploratory talks should be viewed as exploratory, without raising the temperature." Dr. Hu Shih appeared very pleased. He said that the ABCD nations have all agreed that China is not afraid of any event and has no reason to be alarmed, a clear reference to speculation that China must make concessions if the US-Japan problem can be resolved. A State Department spokesman said, "The meeting discussed all situations related to the international situation of the participating countries, and no conclusions can be discussed at this time."</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 23rd – China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands formally joined the United States yesterday in demanding that Japan immediately abandon its pro-Axis relationship and policy of aggression. After a three-hour meeting between Secretary of State Hull and senior diplomatic representatives of the four governments, the ABCD nations have organized a united front in Washington to resist Japanese aggression in the Pacific. The issue of peace or war between Japan and the United States in the Pacific is approaching a critical juncture, making the formation of the united front particularly important. Since the US-Japan talks began in Washington, this is the first time that the ABCD nations have held a joint meeting. It is reported that the diplomatic representatives in attendance agreed with the four points recently proposed by Hull to resolve the Pacific problem: Japan must withdraw from the Axis; Abandon the aggressive expansion policy; Withdraw troops from China and Vietnam; All countries have equal commercial opportunities in the Pacific. It is reported that the Japanese representative has replied that Japan may regard the Axis agreement as a dead letter, but cannot formally withdraw from the Axis, because since Japan signed the Axis treaty, successive cabinets have strongly asserted that the relationship with the Axis is the fundamental principle of Japanese policy. It is understood that Hull's attitude is firm, and he resolutely stated that if the United States and Japan want to resolve the problems between the two countries, Japan must publicly renounce the Axis. It was also revealed by authoritative sources that although China is reportedly insisting on restoring the status quo before the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the US opinion is that China must return to the position before the Japanese invasion of China in July 1937.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd – Japanese sources in unusually well-informed diplomatic circles are pessimistic about the talks in Washington. American diplomatic circles also believe that unless there is an incredible miracle, the tense situation cannot be eased, and American intelligence reported by local newspapers also corroborates this view. The failure of the discussions in Washington does not mean an immediate declaration of war, but will place Japan in a position where it has no choice but to take action immediately, eventually leading to war, such as coveting the Burma Road and invading Thailand, or attempting to seize war materials from the Dutch East Indies.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 23rd – The Thai people are now increasingly worried that Japanese troops may soon invade Thailand. Newspapers are urging Thais to follow the authorities' orders and remain silent if they see troop movements in the country, to avoid rumors spreading and endangering the leakage of military secrets.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 23rd – The well-informed "Suvarnabhumi Daily" predicts that Thailand will mobilize all its resources and place them on a wartime footing. The newspaper expects the government to submit a bill to this effect to the current parliament. According to qualified observers, whether the newspaper's prediction is accurate or not, there is no doubt that it reflects the seriousness of the situation. The "Siri Krong Daily" also assured the public that Thailand has now followed the other countries in the Far East in implementing armaments and that the war in the Far East will surely come, and Thailand will inevitably be drawn into the vortex.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd – Chinese officials attach great importance to the Japanese invasion of the Thai border, believing that this unexpected incident was intentionally created to test whether Britain and the United States will genuinely help Thailand if it is attacked and to what extent the joint plans of Thailand, Britain, and the United States have progressed. At the same time, it is said that this unexpected incident will be a further oppression of Thailand.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 23rd – Local newspapers reported that aircraft of unknown nationality repeatedly invaded the Thai border from Vietnam. According to reports, one aircraft flew over the Nakhon Si Thammarat airfield on the southern coast of Thailand in the forenoon of November 17th and 18th, circling for half an hour, and then flying east across the Gulf of Siam. On November 20th, two French aircraft flew over the Mekong River from the direction of Vietnam's Chak and conducted reconnaissance flights over Nakhon Phanom in Thai territory.</p>

<p>United Press, Singapore, 23rd – Singapore officials have repeatedly pointed out that what Vice Admiral Layton said before, "The naval power of this naval base here must be a factor for stability in the Far East," will be proven in the near future.

<p>Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – New Zealand troops entered Gaps yesterday as British forces in the Western Desert gained an advantage. The overall war situation is progressing satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – A Reuters correspondent reports that the New Zealand troops' capture of the Gaps Fort is of great significance, as it proves that the British mobile forces advancing from the south have now reached the rear of the Axis forces stationed around Solum and Halfaya Pass, putting these enemy troops at risk of being attacked from both sides.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd – This morning, a Middle East British military bulletin announced that British imperial forces had broken into Libya and occupied the West Port of Bardia yesterday evening. At the same time, Omar Newov, about eighty miles south of it, was also captured. The main tank battles between the British and German armies are now raging in the Lech region. The fierce battle lasted all night last night and is still continuing this morning. New Zealand troops continued to advance from positions west of Omar yesterday in very difficult weather, quickly occupying the Aziz and Gaps Forts. This unit also advanced westward along the highway from Tripoli to Gaps and reached positions south of Campute on Saturday evening, leaving a detachment to occupy Bardia. It is reported that the enemy has been cleared. While the above military operations were underway, Indian troops captured Omar Newov, about nine miles north of Omar, and gradually expanded their area of ​​invasion to the rear of the enemy defense positions between Halfaya and Omar.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, New York, 22nd – According to dispatches received here from Cairo, British troops who had been defending Tobruk Harbor for several months broke out yesterday in order to make contact with the British mechanized forces attacking Libya. They have now broken through the German-Italian encirclement and advanced five miles.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – According to war reports received here today from various sources, the British offensive in the Western Desert continues to unfold very successfully. The British Air Force has maintained its superiority throughout. It is expected that the war will end in another two or three days. Officials say that the action of the British army surrounding the Axis forces between Halfaya and Omar is progressing very satisfactorily. It is reported that American-made tanks have taken the lead and achieved the results of capturing Gaps and destroying a large number of Axis tanks and armored vehicles. The scope of this war may be one of the largest in history. Its battlefield starts from Gaps, forty-five miles southeast of Tobruk, and reaches Lech. According to the headquarters bulletin, General Cunningham used the strategic opportunity he had gained to place his armored main force in the middle of the German tank concentration points on both the east and west sides. Although the German tank force repeatedly attempted to break through to the west, it ultimately failed. Although the losses of both sides cannot be estimated at present, it is known that the enemy's losses are still greater than those of the British. British troops in Tobruk, with a large number of tanks gradually transported in by the British Navy for many weeks, launched a surprise attack on Friday morning, hoping to make contact with the British troops occupying Lech. Before long, they seized three important enemy strongholds three miles northeast of Tobruk, and a smaller stronghold nearby. At night, the troops in Tobruk still made progress despite fierce resistance.</p>
<p>British Air Force Carries Out Extensive Activities, Flying Fortresses Come Out to Assist in the Battle</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – A British Air Force bulletin stated that on Friday, British fighter planes and bombers carried out extensive activities in the Libyan campaign. Flying Fortress planes also came out to assist in the battle, fiercely bombing Ghazala. Enemy tanks and motor transport vehicles in other places such as Bardia were also bombed. An enemy fighter plane was strafed by a British bomber, caught fire, and crashed. British fighter planes also went out on large-scale patrols and attacked enemy planes whenever they encountered them, shooting down and destroying eight enemy planes in total. Ground fire also shot down a German fighter plane. It is confirmed that thirty-seven enemy fighter planes were destroyed on Thursday, and the previous report of twenty-two was inaccurate. Five British planes that went into battle are missing.</p>
<p>Allied Forces Adopt Encirclement Strategy, German Army Still Fights Like a Cornered Beast</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd – According to the opinions of various observers, since the New Zealand troops captured the Gaps Fort, the Libyan war has developed into four military operations. The British Air Force's control of the skies over the Western Desert has proven to be of great assistance to the land army. There are fierce battles between Omar and Halfaya. The British army has taken encirclement actions to annihilate the German armored forces holding the positions. Further west, there is a major battle in the triangle between Lech, Gaps, and a small village about 45 miles southeast of Tobruk. The main force of German tanks there is fighting like a cornered beast, hoping to regain contact with the armored forces west of Tobruk. The defenders of Tobruk are now gradually advancing southeast towards the outer perimeter defense line, but have encountered strong resistance.</p>
<p>International News Service, New York, 23rd – Military expert Captain Kracht discussed the Libyan war situation, saying that based on news from all sides, the British offensive in Libya continues to be favorable to the British. It is reported that at least two German-Italian strong tank forces are surrounded on the Egyptian border and cut off from the main force. The British also said that many German tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed. It can be seen that since the British army launched its offensive, the Axis mechanized forces have suffered heavy losses. The next few days may be the most critical moment in the overall situation, which will determine the victory or defeat of the battle. It is estimated that the Axis armored forces surrounded are two or three German tank divisions stationed in North Africa. If the British claim that this tank division has been completely defeated is true, and if the British army can strengthen the encirclement, enough to eliminate the German-Italian army, then the British army will have the possibility of continuing to penetrate into Libya, and may even reach Tripoli.</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Importance of the Far East Five-Power Conference <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, representatives from the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia held an important meeting in Washington. On the surface, it was an "exchange of information," but in reality, it was certainly related to the US-Japan talks, which are approaching a decisive stage. Since the US-Japan talks began, this is the first time that representatives from the five powers with direct relations to the Pacific situation have held a plenary meeting. The importance of its nature is self-evident. Although it cannot be said that the future of peace or war in the Pacific has been decided by this ABCD meeting, it can at least be said that the joint position of the democratic camp in dealing with Japan has been further confirmed by this collective discussion. British Ambassador Halifax stated after the meeting that "all the countries participating in the meeting have reached complete agreement and unanimously support the position taken by the United States in its talks with Japan." At the same time, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, who attended the meeting despite being ill, expressed "pleasure" after the meeting and resolutely declared that "China is not panicking about any event and has no reason to be alarmed." Then, at least it can be inferred that the United States' position in its talks with Japan remains firm, in other words, it still insists on an anti-aggression attitude.</p>
<p>In parallel with this five-power conference, there are reports that the US-Japan talks have encountered difficulties. At the same time, according to Reuters dispatches, it seems that the Tokyo side is also expressing pessimism about the future of the talks. Assuming that the US-Japan talks have developed to a certain extent, making it necessary for the countries concerned to hold a joint meeting to decide how to deal with the situation, then undoubtedly, one side of the talks must have formally notified the other side of the terms it has put forward, either accepting or rejecting them or proposing an alternative plan. According to reports from earlier today, Hull had notified Kurusu and Nomura that "President Roosevelt absolutely cannot agree to take the Tojo Two Principles as the basis for talks." On the same day, United Press also issued a message stating that Hull had put forward four principles: Japan withdraws from the Axis; Stop moving south and north; Withdraw troops from China and Vietnam; Guarantee Japan equal economic opportunities in the Pacific region. If these two pieces of news are true, then undoubtedly, Japan must have replied to Hull, telling him that at most it can accept some of these four principles. Let us assume that Japan can fully accept the second principle, but expresses that it cannot publicly withdraw from the Axis for the first principle, and can only continue to maintain neutrality in the European war; for the third principle, it expresses that the United States must assist in resolving the "China Incident"; for the fourth principle, it expresses that Japan must enjoy "privileges." In this way, on the surface, it seems that Japan has made considerable concessions, but in reality, it is still "deceitful talk" and treats President Roosevelt as a "fool," thinking that such "concessions" can be exchanged for the United States' "peace." Leaving aside what the Washington authorities think of such bargaining, even the representatives of the four countries of China, Britain, the Netherlands, and Australia who attended the meeting yesterday would probably sneer at it! Because today, anyone should recognize that Japan has long been "terminally ill." The "expansion craze" it suffers from cannot be suppressed by any diplomatic negotiations or paper agreements. Its "established national policy" has long become a consistent policy of successive cabinets. All it is waiting for is a "suitable opportunity." No matter what kind of compromise it reaches with the United States, it will never be able to keep its word in the end. Unless Japan can be disarmed voluntarily, it will inevitably have a day when it will still use future "opportunities" to launch new offensives due to the drive of internal and external environments. Therefore, the United States will not want to reach an agreement with Japan, but if it still wants to negotiate a concrete result in order to stabilize the overall situation in the Far East, then at a minimum, it must insist on the above four principles, because otherwise, it would be disloyal to the entire democratic camp in the Far East, and it would be tantamount to making trouble for itself. With the wisdom of Roosevelt and Hull, we dare to assert that they will never be so foolish.</p>
<p>Conversely, from Japan's perspective, if the Tojo cabinet fully accepts the four principles put forward by Hull without any discount, then Tojo will fall. If it does not accept them and cannot reach a compromise with the United States, then Tojo has no choice but to take a risk, or he will have to resign. Therefore, thinking about the current Tojo cabinet, if the Washington authorities still insist on their original position after the five-power conference and are unwilling to make any concessions, then this brand-new military cabinet has only two choices: "action" and "resignation." In fact, for the above reasons, the United States represents not only its own interests in these talks with Japan, but also the interests of the entire democratic camp in the Far East. The convening of yesterday's five-power conference is clear evidence of this. Therefore, even from the standpoint of the four countries of China, Britain, the Netherlands, and Australia, the United States must not be satisfied with an incomplete compromise. In other words, for the sake of the safety of the entire Far East, the United States must insist that Japan completely change its attitude in these talks with Japan, that is, completely abandon its policy of aggression. The United States must not gamble the safety of its allies on an unreliable guarantee from Japan. Therefore, it can be asserted that unless Japan fully accepts the Hull principles this time, it will have no more opportunities for trickery or deception. The common position decided by the five-power conference is the death knell for Japan's speculative diplomacy.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Nazi Troops Heavily Reinforced, Launching a General Offensive on Soviet Capital, Germany Claims Breakthrough of Tula Soviet Defense Line <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 23rd—A city named Klin, located northwest of Moscow, is now mentioned in the latest Soviet communiqué. It is reported that particularly fierce battles took place yesterday in Klin, Volokolamsk, Tula, and the Rostov-on-Don region.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 22nd—Local radio stations have just announced that the fighting on the Moscow front is exceptionally fierce. Soviet troops are still putting up strong resistance on all lines, but in several places, they have been forced to retreat. Heavy fighting occurred day and night yesterday on the Volokolamsk front. German forces reinforced the Mogaisk front with four fresh divisions, attempting to break through the Soviet defenses, launching repeated attacks without cease.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 23rd—Following the announcement yesterday of the capture of Rostov, the German side also claimed that German armored units made a new breakthrough south of Moscow yesterday and are now driving large forces from this location into the northern line of the Soviet capital. The newly breached location is likely in the Tula area, as German forces there are driving large armies towards the north and south lines.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd—Tula is one of the most important outer defense lines leading to Moscow. The fighting on its main roads is now intensifying daily. According to Soviet news agencies, the German side has brought in fresh troops to assist in the battle, and Tula is now putting up an increasingly difficult defense. All residents are engaged in building defensive works or have been called up for military service, with the sole aim of repelling the enemy. However, even though the city is on the front lines, shops and medical institutions are still operating as usual.</p>
<p>German Gambles on Last Effort Before Cold – Battlefield Piled with Thousands of Corpses</p>
<p>Reuters, Kuibyshev, 23rd—According to the latest front-line reports received by TASS, the German offensive launched on Moscow two days ago is the last desperate effort before the arrival of winter. However, it has so far failed to break through the Soviet defenses and has made little progress. Fierce fighting continues on the main roads leading to Moscow. The fields and roads around Moscow are littered with thousands upon thousands of German corpses, and the wreckage of tanks and armored vehicles is also scattered along the way. Although the enemy has a greater number of tanks, they have failed to penetrate deep into Soviet positions. However, the Soviet forces have occasionally abandoned one or two strongholds, retreating to new, pre-arranged positions and launching counter-attacks. The enemy attacked in the direction of Mogaisk with four divisions of infantry but was repulsed after half a day of fighting. German forces launched fierce attacks on Soviet positions in the areas of Maloyaroslavets and Roslavl but were driven back by Soviet artillery fire. There was fighting near Novgorod, 90 miles south of Leningrad. Soviet artillery destroyed 37 enemy cannons, 16 mortars, and several ammunition vehicles, and annihilated approximately 4,000 German soldiers.</p>

<p>— Ji Sheng</p>
<p>The next morning, I saw another lively scene. The towpath followed the left bank up a steep hill. On the hill was a temple. Forty or fifty people were gathered on the narrow road in front of the temple, making a lot of noise. Among this crowd, three or five were selling peanuts and rice noodle cakes, and another three or five were long-distance travelers resting their feet like us. The rest of the group was issuing rhythmic roars, fighting the rapids.</p>
<p>Wu Zixu bumped through Wenzhao Pass...</p>
<p>Ah ha, ah ha...</p>
<p>Zhao Zilong single-handedly rescues A'dou</p>
<p>Ah ha, ah ha...</p>
<p>A man with a clear face and neat clothes, about thirty years old, stretched his neck, his face flushed, standing in the crowd, turning left and right, singing opera lines. His hands moved non-stop in the air, like keeping time, like conducting. Under him was a group of hunched-over, roaring trackers, each of whom walked to the upper hand of the temple and turned down again, using tow boards and ropes to attach to the bamboo cables just placed on the rocks and walk forward. Their steps were as neat as their roars. Their shoulders and backs were purple, and they were covered in sweat, trying to pull a heavily loaded boat, which had fallen more than ten zhang downstream, to the middle of the rapids, under the rocks. As the boat approached the shore, a dozen or so trackers hurried down the rocks, jumped onto the boat, and took up bamboo poles to work; some used the bamboo poles to hold against the rocks at the bow to avoid collisions, some used the iron hooks on the other end of the bamboo poles to hook the holes in the rocks, and some simply撑directly forward. The noisy shouting, the chaotic footsteps, the clear sound of iron hooks hitting the rocks, and the衝擊 between the raging tide and the wooden boat, were interwoven into another kind of fighting sound.</p>
<p>On the shore, the caller and some of the trackers sat under the eaves, eating rice noodle cakes, only two people were assigned to pull one end of the bamboo cable on the shore, looped around the rocks eight or nine zhang upstream. The wooden boat gradually left the shore, and the sailors on the boat raised their oars and rowed vigorously across the rapids. The boat was pushed back by the water, and the slack bamboo cable became taut. Suddenly, bursts of silvery-white浪花 splashed in all directions, and the dozen or so oars became disordered and rapid, losing their original rhythm. At this time, the boat had reached the mainstream. Soon, the tension on the boat suddenly decreased, the number of oars decreased, and bamboo poles were seen flying in the air again. Here, the bamboo cable looped around the rocks was released, and a white dragon穿went straight across the river, disappearing on the side of the boat. The boat reached the other shore and slowly rowed into the quiet Wenhe River, and the dozen sailors jumped ashore to carry the cables.</p>
<p>Our boat was actually carried to the foot of the rocks by two trackers. We were greeted onto the boat and rowed towards the other shore. Not long after leaving the shore, we saw the group in front of the temple helping the boatmen of another heavily loaded boat that had just gone up the slope.</p>
<p>Ya... ya... ya...</p>
<p>Ah ha, ah ha...</p>
<p>They started singing again. I learned later that this group of trackers, led by the old caller in front of the temple, worked like this forever, and they were professionals who "pulled滩."</p>
<p>"The Shu Road is harder than ascending to青天" This is the feeling of the upstream客 and mountain climbers. If you go downstream, you won't have this idea in your 心裏.</p>
<p>Depart from Baidi in the colorful clouds of dawn, return to Jiangling in a thousand li in a day.</p>
<p>The sounds of apes on both banks cannot be stopped, the light boat has already passed over ten thousand重山!</p>
<p>In order to envy this kind of 快意 travel, I often like to find opportunities to take downstream boats.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, I took two sections of wooden boats back to Chongqing. The wooden boat, which was scheduled to depart at 6 o'clock, was delayed until 9 o'clock due to the poor ticketing method, which made us passengers, who were punctual and could not have more breakfast, anxious. "Farewell! Leshan", the boat was released into the mainstream of the Minjiang River,飘飘荡荡, came to the confluence of the Minjiang River and the Dadu River. The roar of the Dadu River, the sobs of the Minjiang River, plus the boatmen's efforts to push the oars, the boat was quickly sent through the rapids. The漩涡 still floated non-stop, but the water flow was much slower. I thought: This is the section where the boatmen should row harder. Who knows, the facts were contrary to my imagination. Six oars were斜 inserted on both sides of the舷 like pairs of treasure swords, and the boatmen were either sitting or lying on the bow,吸 smoking and "摆龙门阵" (talking). After our conversation and inquiries, we realized a little about their theory of going downstream: "推滩不推平" "Slow boats run faster than fast horses", as long as it is not急流险滩, let the boat go down with the water渦, it is already very fast, why be so anxious? However, the boat owner, who was in charge of the rudder, often urged the boatmen to "推呀! "推呀", he took the excuse that the boat was small and there were many passengers, so it was impossible to cook, so he only stopped for a short time. It was not until one o'clock in the afternoon that all the passengers on the boat could no longer endure the pain of hunger, thirst, and expansion of 排泄物, and stated that they would take care of their own meals and forced the boat to stop, which he agreed to. At this time, the boat had traveled more than one hundred and thirty 里. (This is　里, one　里 is about one-third of a kilometer, two-thirds of a 市里.)</p>

<h3 id="e31">The French Police Department Strictly Enforces Laws, Businesses Severely Punished for Raising Prices, Licenses of Five Cigarette Shops Revoked, Three Pharmacies and Grocery Stores Sealed, Price Limits Must Be Implemented Gradually, Hoping the Public Will Be Patient <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department, in order to stipulate that retail stores must not exceed the stipulated price limits, issued a notice yesterday, "All retailers selling various imported goods must follow the prices stipulated by the authorities, as published in foreign newspapers. Each retailer can obtain the price list from the police station in charge."</p>
<p>Licenses of Five Stores Revoked</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department, according to the price control regulations, seized a large quantity of stockpiled soap at Tianli Cigarette Shop at 252 Avenue Edward VII, Hengxing Cigarette Shop at 309, Dayousheng Candle Shop at 452, Congxingxiang Cigarette Shop at 133 Rue Wagner, and Qiaoyuan Cigarette Shop at 274 Ningxing Street, and revoked their business licenses. Several of them were selling at prices exceeding the maximum price limit stipulated by the French Municipal Council, or were hiding goods in an attempt to sell them at higher prices. Such actions, according to the price control regulations promulgated by the French Consulate General, should be severely punished. It can be seen that the price limits for retail goods set by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement are also implemented in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Three Price-Gouging Stores Closed</p>
<p>It is reported that the first store in the French Concession to be punished by the authorities for violating the price limits was Renjia Pharmacy at 601 Avenue Joffre. After the Shanghai Municipal Council announced the price limits, the pharmacy continued to sell Carnation milk powder above the price limits. The French Police Department sent police to investigate and confirmed the facts and seized three cans of Carnation milk powder. The store owner was taken to the police station and sentenced to one week of suspension. According to an investigation by a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the French Police Department also ordered the closure of Yudaxiang North Goods and Seafood Shop at 25 Rue Cardinal Mercier and Fengtai Canned Food Shop at 47 Rue Cardinal Mercier, which sold goods above the price limits.</p>
<p>Decisive Action Pleases the Public</p>
<p>It is reported that since the two concessions actively implemented price controls, prices have gradually stabilized. However, some unscrupulous merchants are still acting insincerely, hiding some goods in secret rooms and refusing to sell them at the limited price, which is a major obstacle to the authorities' price management. Therefore, the authorities of both concessions have announced to the public, hoping to report speculative profiteering behavior. The French Concession is particularly decisive. The aforementioned retailers stockpiled a large quantity of soap and refused to sell it, or raised the price. Dayousheng Candle Shop even built a waterproof cement cellar under the ground, specializing in stockpiling goods, with soap being the largest. It is rumored that all the seized soap will be confiscated as a warning to those who hoard and speculate. Currently, the aforementioned stores whose licenses have been revoked have a paper seal pasted on their doors, which reads, "This store is ordered to suspend business by the Police Department for selling goods above the price limit." People who see it express great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Price Notices Dared to Be Torn Down</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions began to manage price increases and announced the suppression of the prices of various daily necessities, yesterday morning, they printed the published prices of goods in English on forms and posted them on the walls next to cigarette and grocery stores within the concessions for reference during sales. However, some shameless stores regarded the law as a mere scrap of paper and tore down the price list. A reporter from Daguan News Agency passed by Fuchang North Goods Incense and Candle Shop at 197 Rue Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession yesterday morning and saw two apprentices tearing down the price list posted by the French authorities at the entrance. The reporter stepped forward to ask the reason, but the two apprentices gave no answer. As someone openly tore down the price list posted by the authorities, the intention was to be dissatisfied with the price limited by the authorities, and they should be sanctioned urgently.</p>
<p>Wartime Controls Value Speed</p>
<p>Mr. Felippe, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters the day before yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Council was replying to letters published in the newspaper for the first time, but he was very interested in a letter signed "Fair" published in the "Letter to the Editor" column of the North-China Daily News and was willing to take this opportunity to discuss it. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council recently published the announcement on the maximum retail price limits for controlled goods, it is well known that some retailers will inevitably encounter some difficulties as a result. However, if the regulations on retail prices can be carefully considered and take into account all aspects so that all parties do not feel difficulties, then the purchase price of the goods purchased by each retailer before must be investigated. If so, the control of retail prices may be delayed to this day and still not be implemented. The excessive speculation and profiteering of retailers has become an open secret. For the sake of public interest, the Shanghai Municipal Council has no choice but to quickly implement price controls regardless of the difficulties of some people. Once wartime economy is implemented, it is inevitable that some people will encounter difficulties. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to mention the dissatisfaction expressed by many people about the slowness of the strict implementation of the maximum price limits received by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Announced Price Limits Have Been Carefully Verified</p>
<p>The implementation of price controls is a major matter that cannot be completed in a hurry. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that this measure must be implemented gradually. I hope that those who support the price control measure must be patient. It must be known that the publication of the maximum retail prices of various goods must be thoroughly investigated by the Shanghai Municipal Council or the trade associations cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council, otherwise the result will be more harm than good. An early publication is not only unfair but may also cause unnecessary price increases. The Shanghai Municipal Council is doing its best to expand its price control mechanism and implement it as soon as possible. It is hoped that the public will have a spirit of patience and cooperation with the Shanghai Municipal Council. Any constructive suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>Luo Fude, an Englishman and Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has served in the Chinese Customs for 36 years and as Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs for 7 years. As of yesterday, his term has expired, and he has decided to retire. As a result of the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi Kansei's urging of the Inspector General of Customs, Merleau, it was decided to appoint Akayada Tasuke, Commissioner of the Qingdao Customs, as his successor. The vacant position of Commissioner of the Qingdao Customs will be temporarily filled by Goffredo, an Italian and Deputy Commissioner of the Qingdao Customs. It is reported that Akayada, who served as the Jianghai Customs Administrative Commissioner last year, arrived in Shanghai by the Dalian Maru from Qingdao on the 19th and announced his assumption of office yesterday.</p>

<p>According to foreign sources yesterday, some British nationals are currently packing their luggage in preparation for withdrawing on the Anhui, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. It is also known that some of the American nationals who plan to leave Shanghai on the Madison President on the 25th are those who came to Shanghai from North China and other inland areas some days ago to gather and wait for the ship. Most of them are American missionaries. It is reported that most of the cabins on the Madison President, which arrived in Shanghai on the 21st, and the Harrison President, which is about to arrive in Shanghai, are occupied by the U.S. Navy's Fourth Marine Regiment withdrawing from Shanghai. Of the remaining 200 cabins, 150 have already been reserved by American nationals. Of the British and American nationals withdrawing from Shanghai this time, four-fifths are women and children. Most of the British and American nationals who currently have jobs and do business in Shanghai say that they are unwilling to give up their rights in Shanghai unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>About 600 British Nationals Withdrawing</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Tairiku Shinpo, after the British Embassy repeatedly advised British nationals in China to withdraw, a considerable number of British nationals who have followed the advice and departed from Hankou and Tianjin have arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, when they withdraw from Shanghai in the future, it is estimated that the total number, including those who have come to Shanghai from various places, will reach more than 600. They will withdraw to India. The British ship Anhui, which will transport British nationals withdrawing, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th, but the date of departure has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>As Christmas is approaching in a blink of an eye, the expatriate community of this port, in order to show their concern for their motherland's soldiers and to show their solidarity, has initiated various comfort activities.</p>
<p>French Free Forces</p>
<p>The French僑民 in Shanghai who support the continuation of the war, and the侨民 of all countries who sympathize with the French Free Forces, have launched a campaign to raise Christmas comfort donations for the French Free Forces. As of yesterday, they have received 50,000 yuan in national currency. The donations are scheduled to end on the first of next month, and then be remitted to General Tegore in London.</p>
<p>British侨民 Support Soldiers</p>
<p>The British侨民 wartime central donation in this port has nearly reached one million. Recently, the association remitted the donations to the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce, the British Navy Comfort General Association, and the National Red Cross, and has received letters of thanks.</p>
<p>Comfort Child Refugees</p>
<p>The movement to comfort child refugees of all countries launched by the Shanghai Children's Home has achieved good results since it began. The donations will be delivered to the embassies and consulates of all countries in Shanghai during Christmas, and then forwarded to child refugee relief organizations in various countries.</p>

<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 22nd, Truitt, Second Secretary of the U.S. Embassy, has left Chongqing and flown to Hong Kong to take up the post of U.S. Consul General. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, as there was no news of a replacement for the Consul General in Shanghai, the matter was very sudden, so he visited the U.S. Consulate General on Jiangxi Road. Yesterday was a holiday, and the Consul on duty replied that the U.S. Consulate had not received any orders regarding the replacement of the Consul General and did not believe that the Consul General would be replaced. The rumor that Truitt was coming to Shanghai to take up a position in the consulate was completely unfounded. Although Consul General Lockhart is currently on sick leave and his duties are being performed by Consul Stanton, Lockhart has recently recovered and will be discharged from the hospital after a few more days of recuperation and will return to work. The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency also noted that the United Press dispatch was not published and he did not know what the original text was, so he inquired with the United Press. After investigation, it was clarified that the original telegram only stated that Truitt was coming to Shanghai to take up a position in the U.S. Consulate and did not say anything about "going to Shanghai to take up the position of Consul General there." Therefore, this was clearly due to the translator's negligence and mistook a deer for a horse. Truitt's original name is Dium Right, and he is the Second Secretary of the Embassy.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's dredger Jianshe has been requisitioned by the Japanese and the crew has been dismissed, the crew members believe that the Council's action is unreasonable and have requested severance pay equivalent to five years' wages, the last month's salary to be paid as usual, and compensation for bedding and luggage lost on the ship during the Battle of Shanghai. After the above request was made, the Council has agreed to reply within next week, and it is still difficult to predict whether it will be satisfactory. One wave has not subsided, and another has risen. Simas (Jewish), an engineer in the Council's dredging department, has drafted a list of 36 foreign seamen, including Yang Fuquan, who are to be dismissed. All employees are extremely anxious upon hearing this news and sincerely hope that the Council will automatically cancel the dismissal in order to maintain the employees' livelihoods.</p>

<p>Since the British Tram Company in the International Settlement increased fares by as much as 90% in September of this year, it is heard that the company has recently requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to increase fares by 50% to 60% from December 1st. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that the Council is currently actively suppressing prices and that trams are a public transportation agency and should not increase prices, so it has decided to temporarily ignore the company's request.</p>

<p>The French Police Department issued a notice yesterday for the handling of group rice purchases, "A rice warehouse for issuing monthly rice requirements for factories, businesses, etc. with more than 30 employees has been set up on the open space of the McLellan Police Station. The issuance of rice allocated for November will stop on the evening of the 26th of this month, and the police stations will stop receiving application forms for November allocation at noon on the 24th of this month. As for application forms for December allocation, they can be submitted to the police stations every morning from December 1st (Monday) to December 5th (Friday) and from December 8th (Monday) to December 12th (Friday). The rice warehouse will also be open during the same period."</p>
<p>Second Collective Trading</p>
<p>According to reporters, the procedures for the first phase of collective rice trading of 20,000 bags of rice have been completed. After the French Concession Bureau opened the Xuehuali Road Gongji Warehouse and the Masnan Road Fengcheng Warehouse for delivery, there is no shortage of rice in the rice shops. The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association began the second phase of collective rice trading registration yesterday. Rice shops in the city that need to purchase more rice can register at the Rice Shop Industry Association on Shanhai Pass Road. After the association compiles the list, the Bean and Rice Industry Association will convene a meeting to discuss the allocation plan within days.</p>
<p>Hoarders Secretly Transport Flour from Pudong</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions controlled rice, they also strictly controlled flour. The price of flour quickly fell from more than 60 yuan per bag to more than 30 yuan. As a result, hoarders secretly transported large quantities of stored flour out of the concessions. However, the flour within the two concessions could not be moved due to the authorities' ban. Therefore, they secretly transported the flour stored in warehouses in Pudong out of the concessions, resulting in a distorted phenomenon where the price of flour in the concessions was different from the price of flour in the warehouses in Pudong. The flour in the concessions was 40 yuan per bag, while the flour in the warehouses in Pudong reached 50 yuan per bag. Although there are more than one million bags of flour stored in the city, this stored flour is very important for the people's livelihood in the city before the arrival of cheap flour. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention and quickly stop it.</p>

<p>The tofu industry in the city has sent representatives to appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council to lower the price of beans, and has also investigated the quantity of beans and supply situation in each shop. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council attach great importance to it and will not only prevent the industry from raising prices, which would increase the burden on the common people, but will also investigate the purchase and sale prices from the bean merchants for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Chinese Engineers Shouldering Reconstruction Work <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bin</p>
<p>Dr. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, is a renowned geologist and metallurgist. Under his leadership, ten thousand Chinese engineers are currently engaged in industrial and other industries related to the war effort, as well as transportation, mining, metallurgy, and the construction of Free China.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu, Minister of Education, obtained a doctorate in engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, USA. Under Chen's guidance, thousands of young students are studying at universities and specialized colleges to become engineers. Free China recognizes the importance of engineers to wartime industry and construction, and the engineers are not failing to meet expectations.</p>
<p>Throughout China's five-thousand-year history, engineers have made their greatest contribution to the lives of this agricultural nation. Therefore, Yu the Great is known as China's hydraulic engineer. Today, engineers are essential for building canals and dikes for irrigation, dredging rivers, and surveying waterways.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese engineers, recognizing the slow pace of improving military equipment and modernizing it, have become ordnance experts. In recent years, ordnance engineers have been joined by a large number of graduates from engineering, chemistry, and physics, all of whom have received advanced training at the ordnance schools established by the Ministry of War.</p>
<p>Before the war, the aviation industry was in its infancy. Over the past four years, through the continuous efforts of engineers from various disciplines, in addition to the state-owned aircraft factories, great achievements that would have taken many years have been accomplished. Chemical and civil engineers have also made their greatest efforts in preparing for air raids.</p>
<p>Military, civil, and communications engineers, in addition to serving in armories and aircraft factories, are also very active in war-related duties. The guiding engineers and senior mechanical engineers currently serving in the mechanized units are truly the hope for forming a modern army.</p>
<p>The successful relocation of factories to the west proves the efforts of Chinese engineers in responding to extraordinary times. The fact that mechanical factories were able to resume operations within three weeks of arriving at their destination is a testament to the hard work of their chief engineers. In addition to manufacturing ordnance parts, they are also engaged in the manufacture of agricultural and industrial tools, as well as generators and other machinery. Generators and machinery suitable for the chemical industry are manufactured under wartime conditions using very simple tools. As a result, Chinese engineers have become increasingly confident in their ability to succeed.</p>
<p>Automobile engineers have been able to improve gasoline vehicles to use charcoal, alcohol, tung oil, and other vegetable oils. At the same time, chemists have completed the manufacture of alcohol, refining of tung oil, distillation of bituminous coal, and compression of coal gas. The success of most industries is due to the needs of the war and the genius of Chinese engineers.</p>
<p>Mining engineers use machines relocated inland and improved local methods to mine coal, iron, gold, lead, tin, antimony, mercury, silver, copper, and other minerals. Metallurgists are responsible for smelting and refining. Civil engineers build railways, highways, airfields, bridges, and buildings. The 600 kilometers of railway that have been completed, the hundreds of kilometers of railway under construction, the 5,000 kilometers of highway that have been completed, and the 4,900 kilometers of highway under construction are all proof of the harvest of these efforts.</p>
<p>New power plants commonly used in wartime industry, using steam or hydropower, have been completed to supply electricity. Electrical engineers have laid a foundation for the electrification of the Northwest and Southwest, with achievements that cannot be compared to those before the war.</p>
<p>Textile engineers manage new-style cotton and wool textile factories in West China. Before the war, only Shaanxi had one new-style cotton textile factory. The center of the textile industry is now concentrated in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Chemical engineers are currently engaged in bleaching pig bristles, reeling silk, refining tung oil, melting tea leaves, and other agricultural products for export. Engineers engaged in food preservation and canning are very important to the military and civilians.</p>
<p>Machinery purchased before the war that was left unused has now been put to use. Local methods used a century ago have now been improved to compensate for the lack of mechanical products. The theories that scholars learned before the war have advanced to the stage of practical application, and most have gone from theorists to practitioners.</p>

<p>At the Gong Wu Stage, next door to the Great World amusement park on Avenue Edward VII, at around 9 p.m. on the 22nd, while the second act of the "Strange Hero Ouyang De" was being performed, as the stage scenery was being changed and the electric lights were turned off, unexpectedly someone from the upper gallery threw two hand grenades, which landed in front of the stage door, causing a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke. One spectator was hit in the face by a piece of shrapnel, bleeding profusely. The audience panicked and rushed to escape through the doors. Afterwards, the theater authorities immediately ordered the servants to close the iron gates, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. When the French police heard the alarm and arrived in police cars, the bomber could not be apprehended. Later, an ambulance was summoned to take the injured person to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Tongxingxiang Rice Shop at No. 495 Yichang Road and the Wanggongxing Meat Shop at No. 1053 Tokyo Road, on the 17th of this month, were both found to be using inaccurate weights and measures to defraud customers of their property. This was discovered by French Detective Fernandagan, who manages weights and measures for the Public Security Bureau, and Chinese Detective Fan Youyou of the Putuo Road Police Station. They reported this to the First Special District Court, which issued summonses to the owners of the two shops, Zhao Songshou and Han Baozhen, to appear before the Eighth Criminal Court. The Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Peng Qixi, prosecuted them for using weights and measures that violated the prescribed standards under Article 208 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Qiu, they were each severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e58">An Auxiliary to the Five-Year Plan: The Soviet Rationing System <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Yipeng</p>
<p>Allocation to Promote Production, Thoroughly Implementing Class Struggle Characteristics</p>
<p>During World War I, the Tsarist Russian government, recognizing the severity of material panic within the country, also emulated the German method and implemented a special item rationing system. However, the issuance of such rations did not correspond to the actual supply of goods. As a result, the abnormal condition of non-fulfillment often occurred, and the public's trust in the rations was completely lost.</p>
<p>Following the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet government rose to power. On the one hand, it declared the nationalization of land, financial institutions, large industries, ships, etc.; on the other hand, it abandoned the rules of monetary economics, implemented the compulsory requisition of means of production, and the imposition of labor, using rationing to manage a unified distribution system. All Soviet people received the same allotment, regardless of diligence or laziness. Because of the equality of treatment for both the diligent and the lazy, a general state of idleness was created, which led to phenomena such as insufficient material supply and rampant black market transactions, until the implementation of the New Economic Policy. As it was gradually overcome and the unprecedented undertaking of the Industrial Five-Year Plan began, the economic situation within the Soviet Union greatly improved. The fact that it can now compete with Germany is the result of the past efforts of the Soviet government and people.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's past efforts have gone through countless hardships; such as the initial domestic war, the siege of the great powers, domestic material panic, soaring prices, and the flooding of paper money, etc. The fact that the daily consumer life of the Soviet people could survive so many difficulties cannot but be attributed to the Soviet government's production increase policies and rationing policies. Now that the world is in turmoil and consumption controls are prevalent, and everyone is paying attention to the implementation of the rationing system, it seems not meaningless to review the Soviet Union's past rationing system.</p>
<p>The use of the rationing system is based on a background of insufficient materials, and it is not easy to increase their supply in a short period of time. Therefore, we must make appropriate distribution based on what we have in order to seek equality of enjoyment, and to prevent the monopoly and improper waste of a few people. To seek the maintenance of the lives of the entire society; only by maintaining the lives of the entire society can we overcome the fundamental abnormal condition of insufficient material supply through increased production.</p>
<p>During the first Five-Year Plan era in the Soviet Union, the countermeasure to the insufficient supply of materials was to adopt a rationing system. And from the distribution of rations, the role of encouraging increased production was injected. At that time, according to the so-called "principle of class nature and impulsiveness", the allocation and allocation prices of food, clothing, etc. were distributed differently depending on the amount of labor value provided to the society. As a result, the general clergy who made no contribution to social production and the general propertied class who sat idle were not allowed to enjoy rations. Because the distribution of rations was given according to the provision of labor, it was called a labor voucher. There were two types of these rations. The first type was divided into A and B forms. Form A was given to factory workers, and Form B was given to general laborers. The second type was distributed to those with non-wage income; as for merchants, brokers, and those without civil rights, they were not given it. As for factories, government offices, armies, schools, clubs, etc., special distribution agencies were set up to carry out special distribution methods.</p>
<p>Under this method, merchants, wealthy peasants, monks, and other people who did not receive rations had to purchase materials at high prices. Therefore, at that time, the domestic commodity market in the Soviet Union was divided into three types of prices. The first type was the standard price market using rations. The other two types were the profit price market using currency to purchase and the market price market. The so-called profit price market was used when state-owned commodity operations traded commodities; the so-called market price was the price at which individual stores operated commodity sales. The Soviet government believed that those who did not work and eat without rations should pay the most expensive price to obtain their living conditions; if they provided their labor to the society, they could obtain low-cost items with rations. This different treatment did originate from their class concept, but it also deeply implies the great significance of rewarding labor and encouraging production.</p>
<p>However, since there are three different prices with disparate values ​​in the market, the illegal use of rations is inevitable. In order to prevent the misuse of rations, the Soviet government gradually increased its pricing in order to curb its malpractices. In addition, the financial inflation that was vigorously promoted at that time had a significant stimulus to market prices. However, due to the gradual success of the production increase policy, the supply of materials has greatly increased. Therefore, from 1935, the rationing system for bread and various commodities was abolished, and all were distributed according to profit prices. Before that, the Soviet government had gradually narrowed the difference between standard prices and profit prices. Therefore, the suspension of rations did not cause disturbances among the people.</p>
<p>This rationing system in the Soviet Union is significantly different from the rationing system implemented in Germany today. To put it briefly:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union decides commodity prices and distribution volumes based on class viewpoints, while Germany makes unequal regulations based on the physical condition of the people.</p>
<p>Soviet rations are all registered and limited to designated stores; both buyers and sellers are stipulated and cannot be separated. In addition to registered ones, Germany also has bearer ones, and bearer ones can be purchased from any store.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union permits the purchase of materials by means other than rations; Germany does not. For specific commodities using rations, no other transactions may be made other than ration transactions.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union allows the existence of black market transactions and black market prices, aiming to make the wealthy hand over their wealth to society. Germany strictly prohibits the black market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet ration can be called classism; the German rationing system can be called totalitarianism. The Soviet rationing system has an active production increase effect; the German rationing system is based on the supply of materials and implements passive equal distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The British Rationing System <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Binran</p>
<p>The People and the King Receive the Same Treatment, Housewives Cooperate and Contribute the Most</p>
<p>On April 15th of this year, the British Minister of Food, Wilder, stated the difficulty of food supply in the next three months to warn his people. The effect is obviously to intensify the implementation of its food security policy, so it then compulsorily requisitioned all idle land to plant food crops, and those who violated the order were forced to buy it at a price of 25 pounds. It's not Britain's food problem, then</p>
<p>Regarding the consumption of foodstuffs, Britain has implemented a special permit system since October 8, 1939. The scope of implementation includes beef, canned food, cheese products, grains, etc. It also requisitioned margarine and wheat, etc., and at the same time used the average price one week before the start of the war as the price limit standard to prohibit over-the-counter transactions. At this point, the three main points of Britain's wartime consumption control policy have been demonstrated: 　Implementing a quantitative rationing system;　Implementing a requisition system when necessary as a backing for the public sales system;　Stopping price increases and implementing a price limit system</p>
<p>The important consumer goods that have already implemented a quantitative rationing system mainly include more than 20 types such as butter, bacon, sugar, meat, coffee, canned food, sausages, vegetables, milk, eggs, cooking oil, and black tea. At the beginning of last year, it was stipulated that each person could only eat 4 ounces of butter and bacon and 12 ounces of sugar per week, uniformly across the country. Even the king and all members of the royal family were subject to the same restrictions. Since the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the allocation of the following seven necessities has been reduced as needed; therefore, to this day, each person is limited to purchasing fresh meat for one shilling and two pence per week (previously, two shillings and six pence could be purchased), eight ounces of sugar, six ounces of butter and margarine in total, five ounces of bacon, and two ounces of cooking oil and jam each; the purchase volume for hotels and other industries is subject to separate regulations.</p>
<p>The role played by trade control and the management of imported product categories in the British necessities consumption control is also extremely important. Because Britain is an island nation, the supply of materials in the island nation, in addition to domestic production, mostly depends on overseas imports. In order to save transportation capacity, the import of non-essential goods should be prohibited and restricted in order to free up cargo ship tonnage to carry essential imports. For example, import permits were implemented for raw silk and silk fabrics in early October 1939; from November of the same year, it was extended to wool; in early 1940, it was extended to paper; in April of the same year, it was extended to cotton, rayon products, and linen products, etc. Looking back at the price-limited commodities announced in Shanghai today, the meaning of the so-called "necessities" is extremely bizarre. Not only is it not relevant to Chinese consumption, but it may not be entirely necessary for foreigners. On a day when the number of ship tonnage is extremely limited, whether the import of these "necessities" is "necessary" is worth considering when compared with the scope of the import permit system implemented in the UK itself.</p>
<p>Britain's wartime consumption control policy is supplemented by an active production increase policy, and it has achieved great success. For example, the self-sufficiency rate of potatoes has increased to 96%, the self-sufficiency rate of meat has also increased to 48%, and the self-sufficiency rate of wheat, wheat flour, fruits, sugar, and jam has increased to about 23%, which is a great improvement compared with before the war. In the past, there were many courtyards, idle land, hunting grounds, gardens, etc. in the UK itself, but now they are used as farmland for food crops under the government's compulsory cultivation and incentive development policies. The increase in the self-sufficiency rate of the above-mentioned food crops is the contribution of this policy.</p>
<p>In the implementation of Britain's wartime consumption control policy, the cooperation of housewives from all walks of life in Britain plays an especially important role. Because the daily material consumption life of the people is planned and managed by women. Housewives who can deeply understand the overall situation and assist the authorities in carrying out consumption saving and the distribution system will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The German Ration Card <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Guanwu</p>
<p>—Colorfully printed—　—Distinguishing Men, Women, Old, and Young—</p>
<p>The rationing system is the main policy in today's wartime consumption control in Germany and was implemented at the same time as the start of the war.</p>
<p>Three weeks after the start of the war against Poland in 1939, citizens were required to obtain permits to purchase food. There were six types of permits, each in a different color: Bread ration (red); for bread and flour. Meat ration (light blue); for meat. Milk ration (green); for milk. Fat ration (yellow); for butter, cooking oil, etc. Sugar ration (white); for sugar. Food ration (rose); for oatmeal, rice, noodles, potatoes, eggs, coffee, seasonings, starch, sweets.</p>
<p>There are two types of these permits: one is like a public bond certificate with coupons attached. When purchasing goods, one cuts off a corner, like cutting off an interest coupon when receiving interest on a public bond. The other type is like the porridge or meal tickets issued by charitable organizations in Shanghai—one sheet is used once. The former type is used for bread, food, etc. The face of the ticket proves the user's name, address, and purchase quantity and has regional restrictions. It is invalid outside the designated area. The above is issued to individuals; hospitals, schools, etc., have group tickets. Users are divided into: Ordinary consumer purchase tickets; Heavy industry worker purchase tickets; Special industry worker purchase tickets; Tickets for children under six; Tickets for children under fourteen. Even general farmers and producers and sellers of the above items must first report their inventory and production estimates. Even when using their own products for personal use, they must use a fixed amount of consumption coupons. The products and inventory beyond the fixed amount must all be sold and cannot all be used to prevent the malpractice of hoarding.</p>
<p>The above is the form of allocation. As for the allocation amount, it is determined separately based on age, gender, and occupation, and it is gradually reduced over time. The amount stipulated in the second phase is</p>
<p>The amount each ordinary consumer can purchase per week: Meat (500 grams); Bread (240 grams); Fat (268.85 grams); Sugar (250 grams).</p>
<p>The amount each heavy industry worker can purchase per week: Meat (1,000 grams); Bread (3,800 grams); Fat (393.75 grams); Sugar (same as above).</p>
<p>The amount each special industry worker can purchase per week: Meat (1,200 grams); Bread (4,800 grams); Fat (740 grams); Sugar (same as above).</p>
<p>The coupon method for food consumption was already implemented during the last European war. This time, Germany is using the coupon method for clothes and hats in addition to food, which is unprecedented. For the year from November 1939, Germans were only allowed to use 100 clothing coupons. Different scores are stipulated for each type of clothing. For men, each suit of clothes is 60 points, a pair of socks is 6 points, and underwear is a uniform color, accounting for 27 to 35 points depending on the type. Therefore, each German man is only allowed to wear one suit of outerwear, one set of underwear, and one pair of socks per year, because these three types have already reached 100 points. As for women's clothing, it is more preferential. Presumably, the National Socialists also dislike old hags. Therefore, each set of women's clothing is 45 points, a pair of socks is 4 points, and they are allowed to wear six pairs a year; the first four pairs are 4 points each, and the last two pairs are 8 points each. In addition, bras are 4 points, gloves are 5 points, scarves are 5 points, handkerchiefs are 1 point, underwear is 10 points, skirts are 12 points, shirts are 15 points, etc. These have all been stipulated. These clothing coupons have different colors according to gender and age: Two- and three-year-olds are rose; Three- to fourteen-year-olds are green for boys and blue for girls; Those over fourteen are yellow for men and orange for women. Slightly revised from April of last year. The biggest change is that adults have increased from 100 points to 150 points, young children have increased from 70 points to 170 points, and babies have increased to 60 points. This is not the result of an increase in supply; it is because the past restrictions were too strict and had to be relaxed.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Thinking of the Public Interest <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>I am grateful that the authorities of the two concessions have taken decisive measures to implement the price control of daily necessities at retail. If this step could have been realized sooner, the exploitation suffered by the citizens from unscrupulous merchants raising prices could certainly have been less. However, having said that, there are always many twists and turns and obstacles in doing anything, not to mention controlling prices, from a few cents or fractions of a cent to dozens or hundreds of dollars' worth of things. It is quite a troublesome task to investigate them one by one and mark the reasonable price.</p>
<p>"There is a price but no goods." This is the first phenomenon after the price control is implemented. A friend wanted to buy a five-pound package of good XX malt extract milk powder. After inquiring at more than a dozen department stores and pharmacies in a row, they all refused, saying, "It's already sold out." In fact, according to insiders, although the source of this kind of goods is indeed lacking, it is not enough to meet the needs of retail. I heard that when this thing was the most expensive, it cost one hundred and twenty yuan to buy, but the current limited price is sixty-seven yuan. No wonder one has to "knock on nine doors and not one will open."</p>
<p>The result was not wrong. That friend finally asked an acquaintance to buy a bottle at the limited price of the Public Works Department. This kind of thing is not a necessity for ordinary people, but the elderly, the weak, children, and patients can't do without milk powder substitutes. I hope that the enlightened merchants who have the goods will not take profit too seriously for anything. As the Public Works Department said, everyone must think of the public interest, so that they can search their hearts in the quiet of night and not be ashamed.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Another Ardent Hope for the Authorities: Suppressing High Rents Is Imminent <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>The crimes of "house vermin" who exploit residents are extremely heinous, even more so than those of "commodity vermin." For several years, under the circumstance of "rare goods are available," they only knew how to constantly extort and exploit the subtenants. As for Mr. Li Zhen's accusation to the public that "rent should be calculated in US dollars," it is an extremely absurd thing that makes people furious. The subtenants, under the circumstance of "there is nowhere else to live," have nowhere to complain about their suffering and can only allow themselves to be exploited and live in pain. Since "commodity vermin" and "house vermin" are both thieves who exploit residents, now that "commodity vermin" have been ordered by the authorities to be sanctioned and have disappeared and dare not act recklessly, it is also necessary to impose the same sanctions on "house vermin." Therefore, I cannot help but petition the authorities of the two concessions on behalf of the vast majority of subtenants in the city to immediately issue an order to sanction "house vermin" in order to stabilize the lives of residents and complete the work.</p>
<p>I hope that the authorities of the two concessions will immediately order landlords and tenants to automatically reduce rents to a reasonable level. If there is an attempt to obtain undue profits, once it is found out or reported by tenants, the "house vermin" will be immediately arrested and severely punished according to law, or their lease rights will be cancelled, or even they will be deported.</p>
<p>It is stipulated that if landlords (major landlords) intend to increase rent to tenants (subtenants) in the future, they must apply to the competent authorities for approval and shall not increase it without authorization.</p>
<p>It is stipulated that if a tenant sublets the remaining house to a subtenant, the amount of rent that should be proportionally distributed should be based on the advantages and disadvantages of the room's location, according to the rent paid to the landlord and the amount of water, electricity, housing donations, and repair costs. However, the total amount of rent collected shall not exceed the total amount of the above-mentioned rent and reasonable profits. The room occupied by the tenant himself should have a certain limit; otherwise, if it occupies too much space, a corresponding amount should also be proportionally distributed when distributing the rent.</p>
<p>If a subtenant believes that the rent he is responsible for is too high, he can request a reasonable reduction from the subtenant in accordance with the Public Works Department's notice. If the subtenant refuses, he can report to the authorities for compulsory reduction or be punished according to law.</p>
<p>The interests of the subtenant that should be respected by the subtenant should also be respected, and unreasonable demands cannot be made.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state that there are also many subtenants who deeply understand the overall situation, and they are not included in what is mentioned in this article.</p>

<p>Shanghai people play mahjong, it's really common! It's hard to calculate the time and energy spent playing mahjong.</p>
<p>Recently, according to Western newspaper reports: the Scandinavian Women's Association organized by foreigners in Shanghai (a group organized by Scandinavian expatriate women in Shanghai) has begun to hold a kind of "charitable mahjong" entertainment.

<p>Fourteen: Living the Life of a Hero</p>
<p>The first person, with his face to the side, ran for his life, his mind completely focused on the person behind him. He crashed right into Begonia; the second person didn't notice that there was an irrelevant bystander behind the person he was chasing. Seeing the person slow down, he immediately pounced on him and started fighting. No matter how quickly Begonia dodged, he still fell flat on his back.</p>
<p>This fall wouldn't have mattered at all under normal circumstances, but today, he was already exhausted from being on stage. At the same time, he was still coughing incessantly; when he fell, he felt a sharp pain in his waist and chest. It took him a good four or five minutes to get up.</p>
<p>The two culprits were still fighting on the sidewalk. Begonia could only look at them with a bitter face. Knowing that he couldn't withstand their punches, he could only walk away silently.</p>
<p>When he got home, Meibao had already prepared a relatively sumptuous dinner for him.</p>
<p>"Dad, you don't look well. You must be too tired today?" Seeing that he looked very tired, and his cough had gotten worse, and he had little appetite, Meibao became very anxious. (270)</p>

<p>— Yi</p>
<p>A mother's love is originally the purest and greatest thing in the world. A mother who loves her children with her whole heart and implements educational work can create many successful people through her motherly love and education.</p>
<p>In Fort Worth, Texas, USA, there is a Children's Home And Aid Society, which is purely a children's charity. This institution, famous throughout the United States, was founded by a great woman, Edna Gladney, and she continues her great and sacred work to this day.</p>
<p>To commemorate her great achievements, MGM Studios specially produced a technicolor film, *A Mother's Heart*, and dedicated it to this great woman.</p>
<p>This film, starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, tells the story of Edna Gladney's wedding preparations before marriage and the happy family life enjoyed by Mr. Gladney after marriage. However, after her only son died in a car accident on a Christmas Day, she lived a lonely life. On a wedding anniversary night, a Dr. Mai brought a child to her home, hoping to take him in for the night. At first, she refused, but later she suddenly realized that raising children was a very valuable work, so she started a nursery at home.</p>
<p>She encountered the pain and obstruction of her husband's bankruptcy and death, and the non-cooperation of the municipal authorities, but she was not discouraged. She went to every state, every city, and every family in the United States to raise donations, and as a result, she created the Texas Children's Home And Aid Society, adopting children and choosing suitable parents for them, so that they could enjoy the happiness and rights that humans should enjoy.</p>
<p>She believes that every child who is born into this world becomes a member of humanity and should be treated the same as all human beings, and should not be discriminated against because they have no parents. She also believes that if the human beings in this world have better friendship and better understanding, then life will be more beautiful.</p>
<p>This is indeed an excellent and extremely meaningful film. The film itself has vivid stories, humorous interjections, moving performances, and beautiful colors, which can touch our hearts everywhere, making us understand that motherly love is indeed the most precious. Whether we think about it from the point of view of entertainment or the meaning of life, we are very worthy of appreciating this film, especially many mothers.</p>
<p>Because of the noble value of this film, the authorities of the Dihua Cinema specially donated all the proceeds from the first screening, excluding expenses, to three charitable organizations. The first is the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, whose work is divided into three parts: newsboy schools, orphanages, and Huile Garden. The second is the Shanghai Children's Hospital, located at 51 Moliai Road. In the past year, more than 1,000 sick children have been hospitalized, and more than 10,000 have been treated as outpatients. The third is the Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital. From June 27th to May of this year, it has delivered 2,552 births, treated 21,371 outpatients, and the maternal mortality rate is 3 per thousand, with excellent results, no less than any women and children's hospital in the world. The economic sources of these three organizations are mostly from donations from enthusiastic people in the society.</p>
<p>Before the screening of *A Mother's Heart*, this journal specially introduces this film to readers in a warm manner, hoping that the society will have a deeper level of sympathy and cooperation for children's welfare work, and have greater interest and more active implementation in raising children.</p>

<p>— Qi</p>
<p>I married a country girl as my wife according to the will of my parents and the words of the matchmaker. At that time, I was only seventeen, and she was one year younger than me.</p>
<p>She was not only illiterate, unable to recognize a single character, but also a believer of the feudal era. She admired superstition and yearned for wealth and status. When I returned to our small room, she would constantly chatter about the neighbors, saying whose husband had a high monthly salary and good fortune. Then there were things like we were out of firewood and rice. She simply had no words to comfort her husband after a hard day. If I had something to say, she would cry and weep for hours, making everyone aware of it, and attracting ignorant women from the front, upper, and rear buildings to come and watch the commotion. Also, beating the children was something she often did, sometimes to vent her anger, sometimes as a way of disciplining them. We have two children, one seven years old and the other eight. After returning home from school, if they didn't understand something in their homework, even if it was very simple, they had to wait for me to come back to solve it. I had to write things at night, which made me feel even more rushed and overwhelmed. As for her, she only knew how to tell stories, either superstitious ones or those about monsters. When a friend came to my house, if the friend was male, he would go back and mock me. If the friend was female, my wife would argue with me for several evenings. Whenever I went out for entertainment on Sundays, I had nothing to talk about with her. I liked to watch meaningful movies, but she always wanted to listen to Shanghai opera or Yue opera, stories of talented scholars and beautiful women, tragedies that induced tears. If I had business problems that I couldn't solve, I could only bear them in silence.</p>
<p>Her good points also existed: diligence, frugality, and hard work, and she didn't smoke or gamble. But how could I be satisfied with just these things? I need a woman with a respectable profession, who is the same age, has the same level of education, personality, and interests as me. So that we can both pursue independent lives and share the joys of life together. In our free time, we can study together and discuss current affairs.</p>
<p>Heavens! I now have such a female colleague. I have investigated everything about her situation and background. She is also diligent, frugal, and hardworking, with no bad habits, because I have known this from spending time with her every day at work, seeing her clothes and her ability to handle matters. She and I have a very good relationship, so I often think about divorcing that ignorant country woman, but I am often prevented by my own reason. I deeply regret why I married this kind of woman in the first place. I am only twenty-six years old now, and I believe that if things continue like this, it will not end well. I feel that this unsatisfactory family may one day break apart, ah! I'm afraid, I don't know what to do?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding Mr. Hong's family problem, I believe that Mr. Hong himself should bear part of the responsibility. A woman who has not received education often has inappropriate behavior, but this is not her own fault, but perhaps the negligence of her parents. Mr. Qi should show her sympathy and take on the responsibility of teaching her, so that she knows what is the proper way. You like to watch meaningful films, that's great. You can take her to see them a few times and patiently explain them to her, so that she develops an interest. She likes to watch local operas, you might as well go with her a few times. To make married life happy, you must not insist on your own views, but need mutual understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p>Please do not underestimate the virtues of diligence, frugality, and hard work. The fact that she does not smoke or gamble can be said to be very valuable. And the woman with a respectable profession that you hope to have as your wife may not actually give you a complete life. When both parents go out to work at the same time, no one will take care of the household chores, and who will take care of your two children?</p>
<p>To want to divorce your wife and consider your female colleague because of a lack of education is a dangerous idea. You cannot only care about your own happiness, you must also care about the happiness of your wife, the happiness of your children, and the happiness of your female colleague.</p>
<p>To be troubled by the dissatisfaction with the current environment is a very ordinary thing. Please remember that only those who can create a new family life and a new and beautiful environment are great men, heroes in the family.</p>

<p>This is the time to eat mutton again. Although mutton is a tonic for winter, many people don't like to eat it. Why? It's just that the muttony smell doesn't sit well with some people. In fact, there is a way to remove the muttony smell. Just boil the radish and mutton together first, and the smell will be removed. The best way to cook mutton is braised in soy sauce, with plenty of sugar. Adding winter bamboo shoots as an accompaniment is like icing on the cake. After it freezes, it can be sliced, and that's mutton jelly. It's excellent to have with wine. For those who like noodles, using braised mutton and mutton jelly as a topping is also very flavorful.</p>
