<h3 id="c15">德國發動大丁洋攻勢 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>最近英德間的爭戰正在兩方面的前綫展開：巴爾幹的角逐和大西洋的大戰。現在南斯拉夫的加盟已經到了最後決定的階段，反對力量雖仍瀰漫全國，殆已不能阻止其當局投入軸心懷抱的趨向。對此動態，除英國已在該方面嚴重警戒外，蘇聯對土耳其亦更示親誠，保障在土國與第三者關係惡化之際，蘇方不取妨碍土國應變步驟的行爲；這較之年餘以前蘇聯一再切望土耳其解除對英義務的情形顯已有重要變化，同時亦可證實因保國加盟而在蘇聯引起的微妙反應，至今仍在繼續發展之中。日前美國合衆社所傳美國軍事家的推測，以爲希特勒準備由保加利亞進擊英希聯軍，以進窺蘇彝士運河云，這一推測當然有所根據；假定希特勒並不若此作戰，則亦很可能的，德方對巴爾幹的經營，暫以達到南斯拉夫的入彀爲已足；而其最近所致力的，乃爲集中其海空力量於英倫海峽及大西洋，展開侵英的大戰。納粹這一攻勢，事實上年來並未停止過，但在最近，則隨時令的變換與美國租軍法案的通過、確有加緊其酷烈攻勢的機運。</p>
<p>在本月最初一週間，英輪之被德方轟沉者，已達十四萬八千噸，成爲近數月內每週統計數字的高峯。據昨日消息，德方除繼續擴大潛艇攻勢而外，其僅有的兩隻戰鬥巡洋艦香霍斯特號與葛尼賽奴號，亦已駛進西大西洋，在距離美國領海不遠的洋面施行剽襲。照德方所公布的數字，剽襲成績已經造成歷史的紀錄，雖所言或有些誇大，但無論如何，在德方擴大剽襲之下，英輪必不免遭遇重大的損失。與此相輔的，納粹對英空襲連日亦趨熾烈，十九夜的轟炸倫敦，廿一廿二兩日的轟炸樸萊茂斯，投彈均已萬計，其他造船區工業區和要港亦屢屢遭襲，德方自詡此等海空攻擊爲春季攻勢的發動，然則不問他的成就如何，而其已經發動了攻勢，那是無疑的。</p>
<p>英國在海上的覇權和保衛三島的能力。於此均將遭逢空前嚴重的試驗。當然，以英國所擁有的力量而論，無論德力所公布的戰績並不誇大，但與擊潰英國的目標，其間距離，猶甚遙遠；祗要看英國一面努力於保衛，而一面仍能猛炸德境及其佔領區的根據地與產業區，以爲報復；這是英國潛力强健之徵，却仍不能忽視其所遭困擾的嚴重性。察德力的用意，顯然是一方極力破壞英倫的秩序與生產力，一方阻止英國迫切需要的食品原料和戰具的到達；同時亦即是與美國的實行援英，所作直接的答復，間接的較量，以冀在美國的援助到達之前，取得對英戰略上的優勢。於此可見前此美當局一再表示其能吾及時挽救英國的憂慮，絕不只是催促國會通過租借法案的一種手段。</p>
<p>此際德國的對英作戰，比較前此又增加了些新的複雜因素，這就是美國及其對英的援助。希特勒對東南歐的經營，及其對日本的勾結，都費盡許多心力和周折，其功效如何尙爲疑問，而且絕不足與担當民治國兵工廠任務的美國相衡比。就英方觀察，所遭際的破壞與摧毀，此後都不難從大西洋彼岸取得相當補償；而對付德方這一次的大舉攻襲，但求長期的艱苦支撑，依然保持了屹然無恙的强固基礎、則不僅英倫三島此後絕對無虞，彼納粹攻勢必因長期而銳氣消磨，力量衰耗；行見與其盟友之在巴爾幹與北非以及遠東者，相率而同陷於困頹之境。換一種推論：假定納粹此度對英攻勢而得手，這也絕不是納粹確定的勝利；蓋英國的生命綫固不僅寄託在英倫三島，而在於其遍佈世界的帝國屬領；抑且美國早已聲言決不坐視英國的敗北，並已着着進行其備戰設施；到那時，德國將不免再冒着對英美進一步聯合作戰的危險。最近美國朝野都流露出務使援英戰具安全送達前綫的決心，雖然國會對租借案的修正，有不即是護航的聲言，如果英方當眞獨力不足以抵抗德國艦艇的剽襲，美人亦絕不能放任價値七十萬萬的戰具沉到大西洋的洋底。最近一週內，英國在大西洋所喪失的十萬餘噸商輪（根據德方數字）之中，固尙不明其是吾括有由美起運的戰具在內，但在德方海軍擴大襲擊之下，運英戰具如無特殊運輸方式和保護，終難絕對避免與運載食品原料的英輸同其命運；並且德艦一定要以搜尋此種船隻加以擊沈爲主要任務，這也就是美德關係未來演變的重大關鍵。所傳美國將在九十天內參加歐戰的推測，也許過分肯定，但德方在大西洋所採取的猛烈攻勢已經把美國推到了直接參戰的邊緣。</p>

<p>結果在安特衛普與那摩爾間六十　里的陣綫，集中軍隊不下四十師，達到每英里半即有一師團的密度。但在比法邊境的東北部恰正相反，祇有素質低劣平射砲奇缺的極少數師團防守，實際一個師團要防守着二十英里長的陣錢。</p>
<p>更足使人駭異的，德軍裝甲師團從塞當附近的亞丁衝出時，扼守道段陣綫的法軍，甚至並未守禦，而橫跨來斯河上的橋標，也毫髮無損的落入德軍之手。</p>
<p>因此種種「不可思議的錯誤」，德軍遂能突破一大缺口，其進行之順利殊出望外，更因守軍準備上嚴重的錯誤，以致影響愈大。法國雖已在一九一四年受過慘痛的經騐，比利時之恪守中立更顯有受敵奇襲的危險，而法軍依然不知戒備，並未在比利時邊界上建築一道與馬奇諾或齊格斐防錢並駕齊驅的陣綫。同時，不論法國或是英國，都未曾努力編練裝甲師團，準備在前綫被突破時立即施行有力的反攻。</p>
<p>若把戰爭的事實經過，細加分析，可見防禦的力量，尙較我所估計的爲高。德軍方面曾竭力避免對敵作直接的攻擊，而法軍正規式的反攻，亦鮮不全部崩潰，損失慘重，以致後來沒有繼續抵抗的力量。</p>
<p>德軍在進攻之時，乘隙而人，每逢突破一處法軍陣綫，即利用現代防禦佈置，使法軍截斷「通海地帶」的企圖，無從實現。德軍以八師之衆，由摩托車運輸，風馳電掣而進，居然能扼守此長達一百英里的地帶，而把兩側法軍的鉗形攻勢阻住。其後英軍雖兩翼已歸消滅，而孤軍奮鬥，卒能順利撤退至鄧扣克，可見軍隊背水作殊死戰時，雖　寡懸殊，其抵抗力量亦自不可輕侮。</p>
<p>我在「保衛不列顚」一書中已說得很明白，關於攻勢，可以一語概括之：唯攻勢方能佔領敵國或敵軍陣地，而强迫敵人乞和。要達到這目的，攻勢在心理上更佔着重大的優勝。因爲攻勢可以保持主動地位，且祇須所得收獲與所耗的力量相當，對於自己的軍隊不啻是一服補劑。</p>
<p>但必須具備取勝的基本條件時，方可採取攻勢。在戰事開始時的英法軍隊却缺少攻勢所必需的武器，在那時採取攻勢，未免毫無希望。這一層現在全世界都應明白的了。</p>
<p>我在戰前一二年中曾主張我們應採「攻勢防禦」，這是根據「量力行事」的實用原則。英法方面負責備戰的人，多祗尙空洞的理論，紙上談兵，雖然頭頭是道，言之成理，而於實際情形，却毫不相干。</p>
<p>他們不去發展最新式的防禦戰術及其實施方法，而於訓練軍隊之時，仍專注於練習不合的進攻方式，把實用兩字完全忽略了。</p>
<p>我在戰前的著作中，嘗試爲攻守的必耍條件下一界說，德軍在準備戰爭時期和戰事的第一年中，小心佈置，以求適合攻擊成功的條件，可謂不遺餘力，聯軍則對於適合防禦成功的條件，漫不經意，兩相對照，業巳情勢判然。法國士氣不振，固爲事實，而去夏所發生的絕大悲劇，不可由此求得一簡單的說明。</p>
<p>除此未能適應實際之外，聯軍力面防禦還受着更大的阻礙，那不是軍隊之過，而是短見的政治家應負其咎。</p>
<p>英法要謀「西綫防禦」的安全，端賴有一個友好的西班牙，以保護他們的後方交通。這是我戰略的防禦論中一個要點。但是爲了西班牙內戰時「不干涉的干涉政策」，使德義敢向英國的海軍挑釁，且使在上次世界大戰中明白仇視英國的一派，征服了西班牙人民。</p>
<p>要推廣集體安全制度到歐洲東部，則蘇聯的支持，最不可少，這是我戰略防禦論中的另一要點，不憚反覆申明的。不料英國政府未曾事先獲得蘇聯的保證，即貿然以安全保障俾於戰略上各自孤立的波蘭和羅馬尼亞，這與一向所持的妥協退讓政策，南轅北轍，確是出於一般人意料之外。希特勒和蘇職一携手，他便可無西顧之憂，而在東綫向波蘭採取必勝的攻勢。</p>
<p>所以英法政府的政策完全違反了我所提倡防禦戰略的根據。他們不知道堅壁以守。這是挫折攻軍銳氣最簡單最有效的方法，而反給與希特勒以　破弱點的機會，使他獲得了初步的勝利。</p>
<p>尤糟的是：英法如欲履行義務，而實行宣戰，必致放棄防禦而在一無準備與最不利的形勢下採取攻勢，若僅向齊格斐防綫略作嘗試，不啻是自顯無能，假便以全力猛攻，叉未免犧牲重大，而把將來抵抗的機會也减弱。</p>
<p>法軍採取愼重的攻勢，對於齊格斐防綫，毫髮無損，但因戰報誇張過甚，後來的失敗，更是大損聯軍的威望。加以德軍在波蘭閃電式的勝利，使中立國對於德國的恐怖，和英法自信力之動搖，更甚於慕尼克協定。</p>

<p>— 邱希福</p>
<p>恐怕有許多走路人沒有注意到，在靜安寺路跑馬廳門口，靠近西首的牆腳邊，豎着一塊高約兩尺的哩程碑。上面鐫有一行英文字道：「由此往外灘一英里。」</p>
<p>跨上公共汽車，舉目一望，車廂裏大約有二十來個人。大家懶洋洋地靠着椅背，車子軋軋作響，連骨節荀裏都發生了震撼。車行只七八分鐘，一英里的距離已給它征服了。</p>
<p>外灘南京路口的夏巴利銅像，自頂至鍾，斑駁陸離，遠望上去，好像披上一件茸茸似的細毛大氅，雖不鮮艷，却甚應時。這「鐵石心腸」的人，倒也在點綴着黃浦江邊的春色呢。</p>
<p>公園門外，最觸目，熱烈，而動人的，要算那公共電話亭。一抹紅顏色，不知者，幾疑為小型救火會。</p>
<p>在不三不四之間（海關大鐘三時，手上的錶已四時）化了六個五分錢，踏進外灘公園。右首假山石上的一對小安開春兒，撐着傘，好像在那裏躲雨。其實眞要是下雨的話，他們身上還得先空衣服。因為大家相識「有年」，也未便和小孩子們多所挑剔！</p>
<p>轉身向左邊一個大壇走去，一方小木塊上面標明為Single　Earlrz　Tulip單辨早春山慈姑，紫　蘭色的，和藍黃紅相間的，疏疏朗朗的排列着。因為纔經園丁澆灌過，花四圍的泥土還是很滋潤的，把鼻子稍為湊近了些，就可以感覺到一股經日光蒸發之下，從泥土中透洩出來的淸新氣息。似乎可名之為「春之土氣」，胸中為之一鬆。</p>
<p>抬起頭來，遙望外白渡橋上車輛行人，忽忽來往；浦江上大小輪船，黑烟直冒，灰色的軍艦……一切好像跳出了時間的約束，毫無「起色」可言。頭腦又為之一脹。</p>
<p>只顧漫步向前，明看見椅子上散坐着好多對的靑年男女，然而誰還有興緻去加以觀察？一隻隻椅子，接連着一長條，一段段地好像一大串香腸。肥的瘦的，經過江風的吹拂，溫暖而帶有炙熱感的陽光所晒射，雖不見得大家都會淌汗，而各人的面上盡為油光所籠罩，這倒是一個事實哩。</p>
<p>不覺走到東北角上，坦而廣的水門汀平台上，一溜放着六七隻籐桌子，四週圍坐着的，二，三，四，五，人不一。中西參半，衣飾各列。最觸目的要算一個挺着大肚子的洋人。除了上裝，只穿背心，嘴裏　了一根雪茄，正和一個瘦長子在那裏玩紙牌。他們倆是對面坐着，把脫下來的衣服，披在兩橫的空椅子背上。兩個人頭忽而俯湊在一起，幾乎要相碰；忽而又反目無情似的拆分開來，大家緊靠着椅背，昂起了頭。雙手執牌，高高舉在眼睛之前。兩個頭的距離足有半丈來遠，於是上身又像熱天點着的蠟燭，不知不覺地灣軟下來，把手中的紙牌，三張兩張地攤拍在桌子上。在這樣起伏靡定，上身幌搖着的過程中，兩個人却默無一言。好像正在趕做一件不一定對於自身有興趣，而不得不在相當時期中完成的一種工作。</p>
<p>靠着角落裏，一個四十來歲光景，半臃種的西婦桌子旁邊坐了下來。在僕歐拿飲料來的時候，我便問起那兩個打紙牌洋人的來歷。</p>
<p>「嘿，……猶太人！」一聲笑得很不自然的答語。接下去我又問道：</p>
<p>「他們看來是老主顧罷？」「化了三毛錢一杯茶錢（糖與牛奶在內），那張桌子就整天的「賣」給他們了。」</p>
<p>也無庸再問下去了，那僕歐又咕囉了一會。</p>
<p>右隔壁的桌子上坐有兩位特別巡捕，其中一個的領章號數是一個三字的聯號，一望上去很容易記住，這且不去管它。桌子上放着兩個沙示汽車瓶。一隻玻璃杯中還剩了一口。兩人扣上領鉦，整了整制服，搖擺而去。接着却来了一個右手提着大皮包，左臂下掰着一隻長方形紙盒的洋人。帽子上的油跡，幾乎像夏天的柏油路，而脚下所穿的皮鞋，又無疑的為萬里長征的英勇表演者。他擦過我坐位前胖西婦的身旁，走到巡捕倆坐過的位子上。一手把大皮包放下來，立刻却就把那桌子上剩留着一口沙示水的玻杯朝嘴裏一倒。</p>
<p>面上略為浮着些卓別林式勉強的笑容，他放下紙盒，脫掉大衣，一屁股坐了下來。朝四週打量了一會，又向旁邊的胖婦又似點頭又似搖首般的向她打了個招呼。隔了兩分鍾立起身來，走向屋內的糖菓櫃上，買了三毛錢一支的甜心牌Tom　Boy巧克力糖。並要了半杯免費的沙濾水。兩手握了「生命的泉源」，他又重返原位。喝喝凉水，咬口巧克力，臉上浮着的笑容，漸漸地由乾枯而滋潤，由眉梢眼角的局部地位，推而至於整個的頭部。我不禁心裏一陣難過，看看手腕上的時計，正是日光節約時間四時又半，唉！</p>
<p>胖西婦穿着墨綠上裝，棕灰色裙子。腰肢旁有兩隻口袋，都是拉練的，長可五六吋。桌子上放着一個黑色皮包，膨脹得和她主人的身體不相上下。她先拿出一面小鏡子來，端在面前，照之又照。又把血紅的唇膏在嘴唇上塗之不休。嘴唇愈紅，愈覺得她眼睛週圍的兩個黑圈可怕。然而坐在她旁邊的那個男子。凉水喝光，巧克力也不見了。好像吃過了七八道菜的大餐似的十分滿足，帶着癱軟的體態，顯出了求情的慾望。和這「虔婦型」的女人開始搭訕。結果這西人從皮包中摸出一張名片來給他看，無疑地把地址姓名都吿訴了他。</p>
<p>他們倆談話的時間並不為短，我看見有兩個印度人，一個頭上繞着鮮艷奪目的桃紅色綢巾，一個是黃色的，兩個人在園裏兜圈子，大約走過平台之前已有三次之多。那個提大皮包的男人，纔和胖婦殷勤吿別。這時候，又來了三四個美國水兵，和幾對西洋男女，水兵在拍照，個個精神飽滿，笑顏逐開，但是看上去，總覺得他們所穿的制服太窄，週身的筋肉幾乎要奪衣而出。</p>
<p>我離去吃茶的地方，繞過右首短樹繞着的露天亭子，在一塊小草地上，看見兩個西洋少女，和一個中年男子，在那裏嬉戲作耍，推玩了一陣子大家狂笑不憶。旁邊走過來兩個中國女子，和一個盛裝的少婦，他們斯斯文文的踏着草地走過去，微微的帶着笑容，好像是指着那兩個西洋少女，抿着嘴有所批評。這三位女性，給人家的印象，宛如三聽罐頭水菓，本身的色香味都被封閉在裏面，表面上美麗的裝璜，全不是屬於她們自己巳。（未完）</p>
<p>外灘羣象</p>
<p>此景係從「和平神」方面為出發點，由南朝北的外灘全景，主要的建築，已盡萃於是，匯豐銀行，好像禿頂老頭子，老勁十足。海關大鐘猶之一個瘦長個子，嗓子特別嘹亮。華懋飯店隔壁的中行大厦，現已將次竣工，比「沙遜」所戴的瓜皮帽，要長出半個頭哩。</p>

<h3 id="c67">日本財政的危機 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴德懋</p>
<p>誰都知道，日本財政在平時已是外强中乾的國家，當此中日戰爭已整整三年七個月，日本財政日見困難，更無可諱言的，際此日暮途窮的時候，竟通過空前未有龐大的預算，還想掙扎，悍然南進，企圖最後一逞，可是病入膏肓，已是亳無辦法，無非加速其崩潰的日期，現在，我們對其過去的演進與其將來的趨勢，一加檢討。</p>
<p>日本歷史上第一次所遇到的財政危機是在一九〇四年日俄戰爭時，那時，日本曾化上二十萬萬日元的軍事費用，去戰勝帝俄的。但是，這一筆鉅大的數目中，日本是不能完全負擔的，因而日本的財政陷於無法支持的境地。最後，賴財相高橋是淸赴美，以共同開發滿蒙經營南滿路為餌，誘致美資本家購買其公債，結果其中近十萬萬日元的軍費，由美國承購，方渡過難關。</p>
<p>一九三一年「九一八」事變發生以後日本財政上的第二次的危機漸漸又開始了。原來軍事預算的膨脹，簡直好像輕氣球一樣，有點　　響了。我們看：在一九三一年，日本財政的歲出總額還不過只是一四七六百萬日圓的，其中軍事費只佔百分之三一（計四五四百萬日圓）。但是，到了事變的次年，竟一躍而增至一九五〇百萬日圓了，軍事費的數目增至六八六百萬日圓。到了一九三三年，她的財政預算就突破了　十萬萬日圓的數目（計二二五四百萬日圓），而軍事費的比例也從百分之三十一增至百分之三十九，這是多麽可驚的增加！</p>
<p>一九三三年以後，日本每年的財政預算，還是飛一般地向上增加的。在一九三六年增加到二十三萬萬日圓，實開該國財政史的新紀錄！而全國各階層的人民，都不約而同地慄然而恐，勃然而怒了，內閣因此就換了好多次，結果再三減低，仍是二十八萬萬日圓，其中軍事費佔十四萬萬日圓，幾乎達到全部預算的半數。</p>
<p>然而，蘆溝橋事變是發生於一九三七年七月，日本為了增加軍事費支出，特向議會提出戰事預算費五萬萬日圓，以為即可解決戰事，達到征服中國的目的。誰知「八一三」戰事爆發，演成了全面戰爭，龐大的戰費，已不是普通會計預算所能擔負，於是索性將戰費預算劃出來，另編一種預算，這就是她們所稱的特別會計預算（簡稱為支那事變費），在九月間，又向議會追加二十萬萬日圓。那末，一九三七年的普通會計預算是二十八萬萬日圓，特別預算却二十五萬萬日圓，合併起來是五十三萬萬日圓了。</p>
<p>到了一九三八年，普通會計預算也是二十八萬萬日圓，但特別會計預算擴大為四十八萬萬日圓，再加上三次追加預算六萬四千萬日圓，合計竟達八十三萬萬日圓，比一九三七年度數字增加一倍半以上。一九三九年，普通會計預算四十八萬萬日圓，較上年增加二十萬萬日圓，特別會計預算四十六萬萬日圓，合併起來竟達九十四萬萬日圓。到了一九四〇年，普通會計預算為五十八萬萬二千三百萬日圓，較上年又增多十萬萬日圓左右，特別會計預算為四十四萬六千萬日圓，合計是一百零三萬萬日圓，數目的鉅大，雖不能說是絕後，也可以說是空前了。僅就特別會計預算一項而言，較一九〇四年日俄戰爭時的特別會計預算增加十一倍，較「一二八」中日戰爭時的特別會計預算，增加達八十二倍之多。</p>
<p>至於日本一九四一年的預算，已於上年十二月十日經議會通過，據發表槪算，普通會計預算，總數共達六十八萬六千三百餘萬日圓，較諸上年度普通會計預算額，竟增加了十萬萬四千萬日圓，這數字自然在日本財政史上是空前的龐大。關於特別會計預算為四十八萬萬八千萬日圓，那與普通會計預算已達一百十七萬萬四千萬日圓的鉅額，與二十年前的日本增加到十倍，但那時正是日本繁榮的頂點，現在却已臨到貧困的極度。可是這項鉅額以出，却是當局未來的絕大難題。</p>
<p>由於日本每年的軍事費不斷的膨脹，而財政收入的來源，却要分配在全國國民身上，決不能跟隨軍費同步調上邁進。所以日本財政就得走上　發行國債，即所謂赤字公債，　增加租稅，　發行紙幣，從此日本的財政暴露着畸形的狀態。原來歲出主要部分是軍事費，次要部分是國債費，多下的是別的支出。收入方面呢？租稅收入佔了一半，借款與雜項收入也是一半。總之，取自日本國民身上，則無不同之處。</p>
<p>日本的外債，雖然在逐年降低，可是內債却飛躍地在增加着。在一九二六年，日本公債還不過只有五十萬萬零一千六百二十萬日圓，到了一九三一年，也不過是六十一萬萬八千七百萬日圓。但是，到了一九三六年，公債的總破了百萬萬日圓。一九三七年度，日本決定發行的公債是八萬萬日圓（原來是九萬萬六千萬日圓，後減少一萬萬六千萬日圓）。待「七七」事變後，日本又追加發行公債四萬萬零百萬日圓。及後，臨時議會又通過二十萬萬餘日圓的「支那事變費」，這樣一共合計起來，日本的國債，實際上已近一百四十萬萬日圓，相等於全部的國民收入。</p>
<p>到了一九三八年，特別會計預算四十八萬萬日圓中，其中四十四萬萬五千萬，也是依賴公債，一九三八年普通會計預算公債部分是八萬萬六千六百萬日圓，合計起來是五十三萬萬一千六百萬日圓，再加上一九三七年度尚未發行部分十四萬萬九千萬日圓，那末，一九三八年度應發行額就有六十八萬萬日圓之多，統計日本公債的總額，已達一百萬萬日圓。嗣後，日本公債有增無減，截至上年十一月底，公債累積額達二百六十九萬萬日圓左右，况且本年度（一九四一——四二）的特別會計預算中的四十八萬萬八千萬日圓，其中三十九萬萬九千七百萬日圓，係發行公債，所以此後日本公債發行額有增無減，殆無疑問。不過據前日本有名的財相高橋是淸曾謂：「日本公債的飽和點，不能超百萬萬日圓，」如今已越出限度三倍左右，可見其財政的困難日益加深，財政的危機也即暴露出來。</p>
<p>至於日本公債的發行路線有二，一是經過銀行，由該行銷售於民間，才能售出之額，則由該行墊款；一是經過大藏省豫金部，由該部所接受豫金及郵政豫金，為之消化。可是，現階段的日本公債的發行額，已達飽和點，此從下面的事實，可以看出。原來日本年來屢次預計發行的公債額，其發行實數，皆未能達預算的數目，並月還暴露出公債循環運動的脫輻，公債的推銷，由於國民經濟力的枯竭，不能全部接受，即銀行自身，也不能完全消化，茲舉一例說明，在上年，日本公債發行額為六十六萬萬六千五百萬日圓，其中十八萬萬五千萬日圓，由大藏省豫金部經銷；其中四十八萬萬一千五百萬日圓，由銀行經銷；結果一共消化四十八萬萬三千八百萬日圓，當發行額的百分之七十二。今年呢，普通會計預算達六十八萬萬六千三百萬日圓，比上年多至十萬萬四千萬日圓，倘使再有一次或兩次追加預算，僅以上年為準，約三萬萬日圓，那末普通會計預算必多至十三萬萬日圓，打破了歷年的最高紀錄，至於特別會計預算為四十八萬萬八千萬日圓，比上年多至四萬萬二千萬日圓。因此，本年的日本兩種預算，共多於上年十七萬萬日圓，其本年公債發行額勢必要達八十萬萬日圓。在民窮才盡的狀態之下，公債能否大量發行，已成為重大的疑問，何况日本公債尚積存五十萬萬日圓在大藏省庫中，上年猶有十八萬萬日圓不能消化，故本年滯銷率更大，是可想而知的。</p>
<p>日本為應付龐大的支出的第二種方法是增稅，但租稅的增收，却並不是國民納稅能力的增長，實際上是租稅部門各種稅率的　遍增加，所每年預算膨脹一次，日本的財政當局就得加稅一次自「七七」事變以來，日本已經實施四次大規模的增稅，記得有一個新聞記者曾說過如此的笑話，說是「現在在日本不徵稅的恐怕只有空氣了，」其實這句話並不是笑話，却顯露了日本增稅若不多已經是力竭聲嘶了。原來在第七十五屆議會所通過的新稅，對於金龜鳥　…也都在徵稅之列，看來最近四年來，日本國民每年租稅負担，已不可能的。</p>
<p>在另一方面，發行六十萬萬日圓公債，企圖增加五萬萬日圓的稅收來彌補，那是無濟於事的，而且增稅，往往在立法行政手續上比較麻煩，所得的成效，不若發行公債及發行紙幣來得宏大所以現階假日本財政當局，為彌補浩大支出起見，却採取公債和紙幣並行的政策了。</p>
<p>公債的增發，却是國民將來收入的預支，因此公債的　行額愈大，也就是使每個國民的負債增大，至於增稅，是偏重於勞苦大衆負担，對於富有國民並不會減少其財富，日本為應付浩大支出，除去公債增稅以外，尚有增發紙幣。目前日本紙幣發行量倒底有許多，我們從下列數字可略觀日本紙幣膨脹的過程。</p>
<p>戰前，日本銀行紙幣發行額，在一九三七年六月底，最高不過十六萬萬四千萬日圓，至同年底已增加到二十三萬萬另五百萬日圓，計在六個月中激增六萬萬六千五百萬日圓，一九三八年最高額達二十七萬萬五千五百萬日圓，一九三九年，又漲到空前未有的數字，卽三十八萬萬一千七百萬日圓，其後自然回到日本銀行者約五六萬萬日圓。因此上年一月底，日本銀行紙幣發行額減為三十二萬萬七千萬日圓。及後，由於財政上的奇妙，至十一月底，又增至三十七萬萬五千萬日圓，十二月底，竟達四十八萬萬一千七百萬日圓，然而實際上尚不止此數，因為上年四月份實行舊兌換券整理法及朝鮮銀行與台灣銀行保證金擴充後，五月份日本銀行紙幣發行額較前年數字增加一萬萬一千五百萬日圓，所以截至上年底，日本銀行紙幣發行總額，已達三十九萬萬三千二百萬日圓之多，這和戰前的十六萬萬四千萬日圓比較起來，已經增加近一倍半了。</p>
<p>日本不顧準備金的多寡，而拼命地濫發紙幣，自然會引起惡性通貨膨脹，刺邀物價上昇，使人民生活愈益困苦。物價的高漲，是通貨膨脹增稅的必然結果，日本物價高到如何程度？據日人勝田貞次說：「今年日本物價至少較前年漲至三倍，但是前年日本的物價已較戰前高過三倍，所以日本現在的物價至少高於平時九倍。」由於物價的高漲，當使國民生活日感痛，因而影響於國民的健康。</p>
<p>目前日本財政當局，設法使公債消化順利，以避免惡性通貨膨脹。其消化公債的主要方法，不外獎勵貯蓄與限制放款，使銀行界能儘量收買公債。不過，我們知道，日本國民在層層的重稅及高價重壓下，那裏再有閒錢來貯蓄呢？人民活生已極端困苦，國民經濟反而隨着經濟一般衰落而日見萎縮，銀行存款更形減低，在過去，當局曾利用各銀行的存款購買公債，當時各銀行為獲得更大的利潤起見，自然情願承做貸款，誰知戰後頒佈戰時資金調整法，將各銀行自由貸款的權利剝削，欲設法國民盡量貯蓄，以便增加各銀行存款，如今銀行存款反而減少，對於公債方面更難消化，匪特不能壓縮通貨膨脹，抑且更遭其害所以日本在民力耗竭，即使竭澤而魚也未必能應付那空前未有的預算，到了那時候，公債未能消化，祗有濫發紙幣以充戰費，其結果不僅徒是促進其財政完全破產，而且連載事無法持續而歸於失敗，却是可以預言的。</p>

<h3 id="c69">英德的液體燃料問題 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>「一滴煤油，比一滴人的鮮血還要寳貴」！德國名將　登堡這句驚心動魄的名言，想還繚繞在我們的腦際吧？那些為自己國家安全計的當國者，素日對於煤油的開展，硏究其代替品，購買，儲藏，汲汲惶惶惟恐落後的態度，不須要再加解釋了。這一次英德的長期角逐，固然尚未知鹿死誰手，然而液體燃料的儲藏充分與否，往後的供給補充困難與否，無疑的將為決定勝負的重要因子之一。</p>
<p>根據統計數字：戰前的英國，每年平均要消費一千二百萬噸的煤油和煤油精製品；德國的消費量較小，也須要六百萬噸。液體燃料在戰爭時的消耗量，當然要遠遠的超過這個數目，而且估計起來是相當困難的。德國的Steinberg博士，按照德國初開戰時的機械化情形估計德國在一年的戰爭中，應該消耗一千二百萬到三百萬噸的液體燃料。然而在飛機，潛艇，坦克車的大批製造竭力生產之下，誰能知道他將來須要到那步田地？英國在一年的戰爭中。要是比平時也多用一倍，那麽應該消耗二千四百萬噸到六百萬噸。英國幾乎全部需要從旁的地方輸入，按照羅馬尼亞政府一九三七年的報吿，該年份德國的煤油產量是四十八萬六千噸，又據國際聯合會統計月報上記載，德國在一九三九年的煤油產量也祗是七十萬噸。這比起戰爭時的需要的鉅大數目於眞是渺乎其小！所以德國和英國需要從外國或其他法門中弄到夠用的液體燃料的迫切情形，也不過是九十步與百步之比而已！</p>
<p>環顧世界出產煤油最多的國家，根據國聯統計月報的記載，在一九三八年七月至一九三九年六月的產量：（噸）</p>
<p>蘇聯的煤油產額，除自用外，約有一千萬噸，可以供給交戰國或其他中立國；羅馬尼亞和波蘭也可以供給一部份；不過這和兩個交戰國眞正需要的煤油數目還是相差過鉅：這不敷之數往什麽地方去取償呢？亞洲諸產地能彌補的數目頗有可觀，然而出產量佔世界第一，有取之不盡用之竭的，則便非美英屬。論到戰前英德二國對於液體燃料從事準備的情形，英國是有她的整個而有系統的計畫的：英屬婆羅洲，印度，緬甸，馬來亞的每年出產一千八百萬噸，十之八九是英國的囊中物，不必計算，即伊朗的英波煤油公司，伊拉克的坎納　和伊拉克二煤油公司也全是英人所經營；每年差不多又有一千四百萬噸的，灌輸到英國。英國平日和世界第四產油國羅馬尼亞極力交歡，羅國煤油的大部分，也是為英國所搜羅購買而去。所以英國本國雖說是一滴煤油也不出產（？），她却儼然是擁摟煤油頗多的大囤積商了。况說她又依恃着自己豐厚的財源，嚴密的交通綱，無孔不入的商業和投資，不恃世界第三產油國家委內瑞拉的煤油供其挹注，就是其他零星的小煤油產地也在在有她的足跡。現在呢，她　得到握着世界煤油出產量錦標的　國做她　盾，所以對於液體燃料的供給補充，是絲亳不發生問題的。</p>
<p>德國怎樣呢？同英國對比一下，不免要自慚形穢！她本國的出產量，充其極每年也不過七十萬噸：她沒有海外領土像英國的緬印等，又沒有大規模的油礦投資像英國之於伊朗伊拉克，她又沒有大批的現金作為向海外購油的墊款！德國的對外貿易是建築在「以物易物」的原則以上的。這只能向羅馬尼亞國換得最多數的煤油罷了，對於其他產油國家，其有效性就不免大大的打一個折扣了。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>然則甘薯的由外方傳入中國是在什麽時候呢？古書上雖沒有明確的記載，我們就拿以前引證的東西推論，當亦不難知道一個大槪。嵇含是三世紀末期的人，而作齊民要術的賈思勰的時期稍晚；然而他所作的書是「於農圃衣食之法，　悉畢備」的：他旣然把甘薯記載下來，當然是注重它的栽培法則了。我們可以想像：在他那時候甘薯已竟普及到中國的北部，那麽，說它是稍前於三四世紀時傳到中國，想來不致與事實大相逕庭吧。</p>
<p>番薯在我國北方更普通的名字則是「紅薯」，它的拉丁學名係從西班牙文而來，叫作Patatas。我在馬鈴薯一文中已談過：番薯的祖國也是南美。它附着西班牙人的商船，遷居到歐陸和菲列濱帬島：它的所以能眷顧中國廣　恩澤的，正是因為它肯從菲列濱帬島移其玉趾的緣故。這事是有鐵一般的證據的，不必再事揣測了，我們現在且看看我國古書的記載吧</p>
<p>叙述這事最淸楚最詳細的，要算明末何遠喬的閩書了。他說：「番薯萬歷中國人得之外國，……用以支歲，有益貧下。予嘗作番薯頌，可以知其槪也。頌曰度閩　而南，有呂宋國，……其國朱薯被野，連山而是，不待種植。夷人率取食之。……其根皮薄而朱，可去皮食之，亦可屬食之；可熟食之，亦可生食之。……夷人雖蔓生不　省，然恡而不與中國人；中國人截取其蔓咫尺許，兵小蓋中以來，於是入吾閩十餘年知。其蔓雖萎，剪揷種之，下地數日即榮，故可携而來。」徐文定公在農政全書上也說：「……土人傳云近年有人在海外得此種。海外人亦禁不令出境；此人取　藤絞入汲水繩中，遂得渡　，因此分種移植，略　閩廣之境也」。又根據福建省志福州府下云：「番薯皮紫，味甘於莂薯　、尤易蕃。郡本無此種，自萬歷甲午（一五九四）荒　，明年（一五九五）都御史金學　撫閩，從外番匄種　，敎民種樹以當榖食，荒不為災」。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c86">戰時的新發明　維他命和食物 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>戰爭的確亦能夠刺激科學的躍　。</p>
<p>這次世界大戰展開後，各交戰國受了上次大戰發生糧食恐慌，以致影響軍隊作戰的敎訓，於是就殫智竭慮硏究新食物的發明。</p>
<p>在七年以前，維他命B一麵包還是不可能的。五年前只有百萬富翁方能買得起一錢半錢。後來由於科學的進展，五十英鎊便可買得一格蘭姆了。時至今日，只需三鎊錢便可買到一兩（二十八格蘭姆）。一兩的養料，可以供給一人一生，或三萬人一日之食用。發明這新食物的愛丁堡敎授，現在每年由英國政府津貼一百萬鎊，混合在平民每日的食物裏，來增進人民的健康。</p>
<p>此外，維他命C的大量製造，亦已有驚人的成績。據說在意國侵略阿比希尼亞的時候，墨索里尼曾由倫敦召回軍醫專家凱司多里尼爵士Sir　Castcllani到前綫硏究士兵們缺乏蔬菜，檸檬，水果而發生的壞血症，這位爵士趕到後，使强迫每個人都日食檸檬一枚，而解決了這嚴重問題。</p>
<p>最近，英國有位飲食專家勞斐爾太太Mrs.　Loewenfield和戰時食物部又勸吿國民採食野薔薇果實，做成菜湯，果漿……因為其中含有大量維他命C的緣故，所以並有預防感冒症的效用。</p>
<p>倫敦出版的著名醫學雜誌The　Laucent上，不久以前刋載了某著名物理學家的實騐證明：兩隻老鼠，一餵維他命B一麵包，一餵全麩麵包，結果後者重量反多一倍，於是皇家學會便發表論文否定了維他命B一的價値，並且認為英國人從「牛奶，水果，靑菜，全麩麵包」的食譜，而改為「白麵包，肉」，是一種退步，現在正在展開激烈的論爭。</p>
<p>戰時糧食必然會發生一種程度不同的恐慌，國民的營養問題的確是値得注意和硏究。希望我國的科學家，醫學家對這高級發展的科學戰時嚴重問題，能夠特別加以注意。</p>

<p>— 于厂</p>
<p>春風吹去了酷寒的季節，大家重又把冬天的衣服脫了下來，跟着換上來的，應當是初春的服裝了。現在我們就來談談春衣問題：</p>
<p>女子適合春季的旗袍料，可用國貨的棉織呢來裁製，質料當要選擇挺括而帶柔軟性的，色彩則以中藍色，米色，咖啡色等為上，式樣只要長及膝蓋就夠了。這樣不但經濟實惠，而且看上去亦很活潑。</p>
<p>男子適合春季的袍料亦宜用國貨，因「衣不在華，得體則　」；尤其在這個年頭，更要將「節儉」二字為前提，而且本國的出品旣樸素大方，眞是最理想的衣料呢！</p>

<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>近來關於「節約用電」的呼聲，已到處都喊成了一片，的確，這個問題的嚴重性，我們實在不能忽視。因此我們目前第一步的補救辦法，當然是極力節省用電，這非但對於本身能減少電費的支出，且還有利於大衆和社會。</p>
<p>關於商店公共娛樂塲所等處的用電，當局已勸吿可用和限制，這裏可不必再談，現祗將家庭間應注意之處，寫在下面，或能稍供參攷吧？</p>
<p>（一）限少燈泡度數：譬如原來點五十支光的電燈，現在可以改換二十五支光的，或十五支光的，最好多買幾只燈泡，在工作的時候換亮些的燈泡，反之換暗些的燈泡，總以足夠亮得可用為度，這樣對於工作方面可不致有妨害。</p>
<p>（二）實行早睡：近來本在提倡日光節約，所以我們正可實行早起早睡，在白天，最好不要休息，利用日光把各種雜務做好，（除非不可能的事例外，）天一暗，可熄了電燈休息談天，在九時左右就睡覺，這樣也可說在遵行新生活運動。</p>
<p>（三）樓梯等處可用五支光的電燈，因那種地方，祗要能看得出已好了，不必十分亮的。</p>
<p>（四）不開無綫電，尋求些別的正當娛樂，如閱讀書報唱歌奏樂等。</p>
<p>總之，其他節省用電的地方還很多，這　　各個家庭間的留意和硏究，俾能越省越好，希望大家推行為是。</p>

<p>— 齊為德</p>
<p>二十二日大通社有一條新聞，云：此次處洽卿氏公佈私人辦米賬略中，有趙慶記愼記及張玉記三戶，外間頗有懷疑，其實趙　記係米業掮客聯誼會主席趙慶瀾君；愼記係北京路東方匯理銀行樓上愼記米行；張玉記係同茂新記米行經理張玉書君，均係由各該戶轉售米店者當時因限於廣告篇幅故未能詳細載明。一如何呢？據我所知道的：一月在這條新聞的上一天，我剛在本刊寫了篇「讀虞氏」啟事」有感』，內有『雖然日期只到本年一月十九日爲止，及售出項下有「愼記」「趙機記」等戶名，尙不免使人懷疑者外，……」「做賊心虛」，我就覺得大通社的發這條「聲明」是針對着我的那篇文字的。我與虞氏無一面之「緣」，與來業更是「隔膜」，祗是就事論事，發表一些私人之見而已，而且我的文字中已說明『在這艱難困苦的年頭，也小是求功過的時候，祇要所做的事，「撫躬循省」，確實是爲社會國家謀福利的，儘可不顧毀譽，努力以赴。』所以虞氏在不得不離開上海之後，再判登啟事，似乎已經多餘的了：因爲「未明眞相」者是不會在這幅廣告上滿意的，譬如我就對於上述兩點不免有所懷疑；至於「已明眞相」者自然用不着什麼「簿籍具在，可供查閱」等『小氣話」了，譬如大通社就肯「見義勇爲」地以「新聞」補廣吿篇幅之不足。</p>
<p>然而也正爲了大通社的「聲明」，使我也不得不對教的「懷疑」再加一點補充「愼記」「趙慶記」是」寃有頭債有主」了；可是一月十九日以後的賬目二十一日挪商華綸洋行的格蘭輪運到二萬七千九百九十包；二月五日同上洋行經理的G.G.A.Vaenne輪運到三萬一千包；二月十五日同上洋行的A.bert　Sarrant輪運到二萬四千五百包；三月十六日德達輪運到三萬零九百十三包；三月十八日G.G.A.Varenne又運到三萬零五百包；以上共計十四萬四千九百零　包。不知大通社能否爲我找出這十幾萬包米的「戶名」否？</p>
<p>總之，虞氏的「啟事」中很明白的說着「以夙營航業故，運輸船隻之困難，得以勉爲排除」，並且「來滬經商，已閱六十寒暑」，在商言商，因爲自己有「鐵駁」而在「水脚」上佔些「便利」，也不爲過的；然而正因爲「洽卿老矣」，才「致獲此求全之毀」，其他「將老」的就應該讀此「啟事」而有所警惕；至於根本離「老」也差上十萬八千里的就乾脆希望米價下跌，而米價如何才能下跌，在當局與社會人士之努力籌劃外，報章與通訊社也是應該負輿論上</p>

<p>「賣掉了嗎？」</p>
<p>亭子間門「呀」的一聲開了進來，王師母忙問着跑進來的滿頭大汗的王先生。</p>
<p>王先生沒有回答，只是搖頭，嘆氣。</p>
<p>王先生望望王師母，王師母望望王先生。終於王先生打破沉默。</p>
<p>「這班奸商，眞是該殺！照市面，每箱要四十元，我賣的責仟的！</p>
<p>言盡於此，知我罪我。給他們三十五，他們不要，赫，要殺到三十元一箱。我跑了一個大圈子，都是這樣。我，我買來要二十二元一箱呢，還有車錢，唉！」</p>
<p>王先生望望床下堆的十箱肥皂，心頭眞是無限愁悶。王先生是××中學的敎員，憑着他的能幹，居然在這謀事難的孤島上兼了三隻中學的敎課。但是，無論如何，總是每月要從王師母的儲蓄項下去支取些來貼補開銷的。</p>
<p>上個星期，王先生看見市面又漲，靈機一動，勸王師母將款項一起提出來賺「大錢」，王師母起初不肯，但是最後終於被王先生說服，提出了三百五十塊錢。王先生於是興高彩烈的去買了十箱肥皂，滿以爲從此一本高利，也可不吃敎書飯了。</p>
<p>果然，肥皂泓了。王先生每天早晨，總是先翻開報來看經濟消息，並且總是興高彩烈，高談闊論他的偉大的計劃。</p>
<p>王師母也是很高興，因爲據王先生說，三百五至少已變了四百！</p>
<p>但是，據說，市面快要跌了。並且，還有一個大原因，王先生衆裏的米　已經空了。因此，王先生決定先賣掉五箱再說。</p>
<p>昨天，王先生跑了一天；今天，王先生又跑了一天。</p>
<p>「你不是說一箱要四十多，怎麼三十五都沒人要呢？」</p>
<p>「這，這就是奸商的可惡啊！」</p>
<p>「我，我早就說安分點好，橫財不富命窮人！」</p>
<p>「哼！如今倒又說風凉話了，你不想發財？」王先生生氣了。</p>
<p>「不賣！我不賣！非到四十元一箱不賣！」</p>
<p>這使王先生氣上加氣，「明天，明天的米呢？」</p>
<p>他說完話倐的站起來，向外走。</p>
<p>「你打算怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「有什麼打算呢？去賣掉好了！」王先生似乎成了戰塲上的俘虜，神敗氣沮的。</p>
<p>「不留五箱待漲麼？」</p>
<p>「漲？呸！」</p>
<p>王先生出去，很快地回來。</p>
<p>「蝕二十塊錢！不！替奸商們賺幾十塊錢，唉！」</p>

<p>Washington - Official sources here foresee that shortly after Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of China cabled President Roosevelt, assuring that China would continue fighting until victory, the United States would soon expand aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act. The Department of Commerce officially estimated that Japan's financial position was unstable and stated that speeches since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War were very inspiring. "The Chinese people are deeply impressed by Your Excellency's reiteration of American aid to China for the sake of freedom." It is reported that Chairman Chiang's cable was sent to Washington on March 17th, (United Press dispatch, 23rd).</p>

<p>Manila - Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, will publish an article here tomorrow commemorating the 41st anniversary of the local newspaper, thanking the United States for its effective assistance and moral encouragement whenever China's war effort has been slightly unfavorable or the morale of the people has declined. Ambassador Hu recalled the various US loans to China, saying, "These were all done by the United States for the benefit of its national defense policy, but our government and people deeply feel its moral impact on our war of resistance. I assure millions of Chinese friends that our people will do their best to live up to the sympathy of the American people. We have resisted aggression and fought hard for three and a half years. Our own fighting also helps those elsewhere in the world who are engaged in the same war. We have prevented one of the most terrible aggressors from taking advantage of the European war to plunder the most advantageous places. Now that the United States has given moral and economic assistance, and the international situation has also turned in favor of China, the Chinese people will continue as before, determined to continue fighting for years or months, until a fair and lasting peace is achieved."

<p>Manila - Chinese Consul General Dr. Yang Guangzhu declared today, "London and Chongqing have become the first line of defense to protect the fate of all nations that believe in freedom and democracy." Dr. Yang said in a speech at the 20th graduation ceremony of the Chinese Hospital Nursing School here, "In the past year, many countries have disappeared from the map. The remaining small countries can no longer believe that maintaining neutrality and not offending others will exempt them from aggression. After Japan's war against China became difficult, it shifted its target to Southeast Asia, where British and American global businesses are linked by Singapore and the Philippines. The future global dominance of Britain and the United States depends entirely on the individual or collective strength of this connection. If we want to consolidate this British-American connection, China naturally has a very important relationship. If the people of Southeast Asia engage in preparation, it may be possible to hope that atrocities will not invade Southeast Asia, but in the current situation, whether pessimistic or optimistic, we must accept reality. The cruel reality of international chaos has come upon us, and escape will not be spared. If we rise up and resist it, we can survive; if we surrender to it, we will be destroyed."

<h3 id="e15">Germany Launches a Major Atlantic Offensive <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The recent struggle between Britain and Germany is unfolding on two fronts: the contest in the Balkans and the battle in the Atlantic. Now, Yugoslavia's accession is at the final decision stage. Although opposition forces still permeate the country, they are hardly able to prevent its authorities from throwing themselves into the embrace of the Axis. In response to this movement, in addition to Britain's serious vigilance in that area, the Soviet Union has also shown greater sincerity towards Turkey, guaranteeing that in the event that Turkey's relations with a third party deteriorate, the Soviet side will not take any actions that hinder Turkey's steps to respond. This is a significant change compared to the situation more than a year ago when the Soviet Union repeatedly hoped that Turkey would lift its obligations to Britain. At the same time, it can also confirm that the subtle reactions caused in the Soviet Union by Bulgaria's accession are still continuing to develop. The American United Press recently reported the speculation of American military experts that Hitler was preparing to attack the British-Greek Allied forces from Bulgaria in order to peer into the Suez Canal. This speculation is of course based on something. Assuming that Hitler does not operate in this way, it is also very likely that the German side's management of the Balkans will temporarily take Yugoslavia's entry as enough. What they have been striving for recently is to concentrate their naval and air power in the English Channel and the Atlantic to launch a major offensive against Britain. This Nazi offensive has not actually stopped over the years, but recently, with the change of seasons and the passage of the American Lend-Lease Act, it does have the opportunity to intensify its brutal offensive.</p>
<p>In the first week of this month, the tonnage of British ships sunk by the German side reached 148,000 tons, becoming the peak of the weekly statistics in recent months. According to yesterday's news, in addition to continuing to expand the submarine offensive, its only two battlecruisers, the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, have also sailed into the western Atlantic, carrying out raids on the ocean surface not far from American territorial waters. According to the figures published by the German side, the results of the raids have created a historical record. Although some of what is said may be exaggerated, in any case, under the German side's expansion of raids, British ships will inevitably suffer significant losses. Complementing this, the Nazi air raids on Britain have also become increasingly fierce in recent days. The bombing of London on the 19th night and the bombing of Plymouth on the 21st and 22nd days each involved tens of thousands of bombs. Other shipbuilding areas, industrial areas, and key ports have also been repeatedly attacked. The German side boasts that these naval and air attacks are the launch of the spring offensive, so regardless of his achievements, it is undoubtedly that he has already launched an offensive.</p>
<p>Britain's maritime hegemony and its ability to defend the three islands will both face unprecedentedly severe tests here. Of course, in terms of the strength that Britain possesses, no matter how exaggerated the battle results announced by the German forces are, the distance between them and the goal of defeating Britain is still very far away. Just look at Britain's efforts to defend on the one hand, and still being able to fiercely bomb German territory and the bases and industrial areas in its occupied areas as retaliation. This is a sign of Britain's strong potential, but we still cannot ignore the seriousness of the troubles it is facing. Chatwick's intention is obviously to try to disrupt the order and productivity of Britain on the one hand, and to prevent the arrival of urgently needed food materials and war equipment on the other hand. At the same time, it is also making a direct response and indirect contest with the United States' implementation of aid to Britain, hoping to gain a strategic advantage over Britain before American aid arrives. From this, it can be seen that the anxiety repeatedly expressed by the American authorities that they could timely save Britain is by no means just a means of urging Congress to pass the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>At this moment, Germany's war against Britain has added some new complex factors compared to before. This is the United States and its aid to Britain. Hitler has spent a lot of effort and twists and turns on his management of Southeastern Europe and his collusion with Japan. How effective they are is still questionable, and they are certainly not enough to compare with the United States, which shoulders the task of the arsenal of democracy. From the British point of view, the destruction and devastation they have suffered can easily be adequately compensated from across the Atlantic in the future. As for dealing with this major offensive by the German side, they only need to endure long-term hard support and still maintain a solid and intact foundation, then not only will the British Isles be absolutely worry-free in the future, but the Nazi offensive will inevitably wear down its spirit and weaken its strength due to the long term. It is seen that its allies in the Balkans and North Africa as well as the Far East will fall into a state of distress together. Another inference: assuming that the Nazi offensive against Britain succeeds this time, this is by no means a definite victory for the Nazis, because Britain's lifeline is not only entrusted to the British Isles, but also to its empire's territories spread all over the world. Moreover, the United States has long declared that it will never sit idly by and watch Britain's defeat, and has already begun to carry out its war preparations. At that time, Germany will inevitably risk a further joint war with Britain and the United States. Recently, both the American government and the public have revealed their determination to ensure that the war equipment aiding Britain is safely delivered to the front line. Although the amendment of the Lend-Lease Act by Congress does not immediately mean escorting, if the British are truly unable to resist the German warships' raids on their own, the Americans will never be able to let 7 billion worth of war equipment sink to the bottom of the Atlantic. Among the more than 100,000 tons of merchant ships lost by Britain in the Atlantic in the past week (according to German figures), it is still unclear whether it includes war equipment shipped from the United States, but under the expanded attacks of the German navy, it is ultimately difficult to absolutely avoid war equipment transported to Britain from sharing the fate of British ships carrying food and raw materials without special transportation methods and protection. Furthermore, German warships must take searching for and sinking these ships as their primary task, which is also a major key to the future evolution of US-German relations. The speculation that the United States will participate in the European war within ninety days may be too assertive, but the fierce offensive adopted by the German side in the Atlantic has pushed the United States to the brink of direct participation in the war.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Victory in Various Routes in Northern Jiangxi, Chinese Army Counteroffensive Achieves Significant Results, Fierce Fighting in Key Points and City Walls Southwest of Gao'an, Sinking of Japanese Ship in the Middle of the Gan River, Japanese Army Annihilated <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Shanggao - The Chinese army on all routes in northern Jiangxi has launched extremely fierce battles with the Japanese army in recent days. After days and nights of bloody battles, all routes have achieved remarkable results. The beginning of victory in northern Jiangxi has been established since the night of the 19th, when the Chinese army greatly defeated the Japanese vanguard in the direction of Cunqian Street. On the same night, the Japanese in Quanquan Port Street on the west bank of the Gan River attempted to move towards Fengcheng. The Chinese army waited for them to be halfway across the Gan River, then suddenly launched a fierce attack, sinking the Japanese ship and annihilating the entire Japanese army.

<h3 id="e30">Rumor of German Letter to Yugoslav Prime Minister Urging a Quick Resolution to the Cabinet Crisis, Public Demonstrations Oppose Joining the Axis Powers, Britain and America Also Exerting Diplomatic Pressure on Yugoslavia <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – Rumors say that German Head of State Hitler demanded that Yugoslavia reorganize its cabinet within forty-eight hours and sign a treaty with the Axis powers. After this news spread, fierce disturbances occurred among the people in various provinces of Yugoslavia today. Although Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković has assured the German Minister to Yugoslavia, Heeren, that three new cabinet members will be sworn in today to replace those who resigned, his efforts to persuade popular leaders to join the government appear to have failed. It is said that since the German Minister to Yugoslavia, Heeren, handed Yugoslavia a letter that was practically an ultimatum, Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković have redoubled their efforts to resolve the internal strife. It is reported that the American Minister to Yugoslavia, Lane, and the British Minister, Campbell, met with the Yugoslav Prime Minister and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Marković, yesterday. Since the sudden outbreak of the crisis on Friday, open demonstrations against joining the Axis powers were only initial yesterday. The Yugoslav government guarded the capital with a large police force. Several reserve officers and seasoned soldiers carried flags supporting Britain and staged anti-Axis power demonstrations. The Yugoslav High Command has canceled army leave, effective from Tuesday, indicating that the army is currently planning to deal with the internal strife that may be caused by the signing of the Axis powers treaty. Today, Prince Paul, disregarding the opposition of the people, decided to send Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković to Vienna tomorrow, as this is the only way to avoid war. It was learned at dawn today that the Yugoslav Prime Minister has found three Serbs willing to fill cabinet positions. It is generally believed that after the treaty is signed, the Yugoslav cabinet will resign en masse to avoid the responsibility for self-inflicted civil war. Fierce demonstrations demanding that Yugoslavia maintain neutrality and independence have erupted in various villages in the Montenegrin region. The Yugoslav Reserve Officers Association has resolved to disband, opposing the government's signing of a treaty that violates Yugoslavia's honor and independence. The association has sent a delegation to Prince Paul to tell the Yugoslav Regent, "We are prepared to defend our country's sovereignty and borders with our lives." (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – The national opposition to signing a treaty with the Axis powers seems to be gradually increasing. There was a small-scale anti-Axis demonstration outside the German embassy yesterday, but it did not reach a serious level. Diplomatic activities here were still very active yesterday. The Greek Minister visited the Yugoslav Foreign Minister. It is heard that three officers from the Yugoslav General Staff have entered Greece and left a letter stating that they want to fight immediately and cannot tolerate the current delay within Yugoslavia. It is also heard that four Yugoslav pilots have entered Greek territory in three aircraft and dedicated their planes to the Allied forces. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – According to various sources, Yugoslavia will likely formally join the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan on the 25th or 27th of this month. Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, held talks with Army Chief of Staff General Kosić and former Prime Minister Ivković today. It was immediately decided that the national army should be on alert for three days, the 25th, 26th, and 27th of March, in order to suppress public demonstrations at any time. At that time, all officers and soldiers, except those who have obtained special permission, shall not leave the barracks even a step. The defenses along the border between Yugoslavia and Greece have also been strengthened. Although the government has not yet formally announced its decision to join the Tripartite Pact, the reports in the newspapers only say that the government has not made any decision that would violate national integrity and independence. However, this news has spread like wildfire throughout the country, and those who oppose Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact have organized various groups to oppose the government's decision. Minister of Justice Konstantinović and Minister of Social Welfare Budisavljević have submitted their resignations. Although the successors have not yet been formally announced, the general public is discussing the candidates. It is generally believed that the position of Minister of Justice will be succeeded by the government party leader Jagović, and the Minister of Social Welfare will be succeeded by Ivković, a member of the Independent Democratic Party. Minister of Agriculture Privić also intends to resign, and the vacant position will likely be succeeded by Joksić, a left-wing leader of the Peasant Party known for his pro-Soviet views. The government will announce the appointment of these three ministers at the same time as accepting the resignations of the previous three ministers. The government is currently continuing discussions with leaders of the Peasant Party and the Democratic Party to discuss national affairs, striving to eliminate the difficulties caused by the previous cabinet decision to join the Tripartite Pact. These two parties have decided to convene a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, at which the three resigning ministers will deliver speeches, report on the situation, and explain the reasons for their resignations. Gavrilović, the leader of the Serbian Peasant Party and the current ambassador to the Soviet Union, has departed from Moscow to return home to participate in the meeting. It is not yet possible to confirm rumors that he has submitted his resignation. This rumor is likely due to the news that the entire Senate of the Peasant Party has resigned. Senator Čatagala of the party has also telegraphed Prince Paul to request a meeting and to request that the Senate be convened immediately to hold a foreign policy debate. In addition, several political groups and the Veterans Association of the last European War have also telegraphed Prince Paul and the government authorities, respectively, expressing their opposition to joining the Tripartite Pact and issuing warnings.

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – Even with the intervention of Britain and America becoming increasingly urgent, the cabinet crisis in Yugoslavia appears to be approaching resolution tonight, as the country has almost decided to join the Axis powers within a few days. Informed sources say that the aim of Britain and America is to encourage Yugoslavia to stand firm against Germany and prevent Yugoslavia from signing the Tripartite Agreement. However, this intervention by the United States and Britain has come too late to prevent Yugoslavia from joining the Axis powers. (According to a Washington dispatch, Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States Fotić had three consultations with US Secretary of State Welles this week. Although Welles said that these consultations only discussed economic issues and were of a general nature, authoritative sources believe that the so-called economic issues can be regarded as the possibility of Yugoslavia obtaining assistance from the Lend-Lease Act. According to a London dispatch, British Minister to Yugoslavia Campbell has recently had frequent contact with Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul, and knowledgeable sources are keeping silent on the exchange of views between Britain and Yugoslavia. It is reported that Britain has indicated to Yugoslavia that joining the Axis powers will have certain consequences.) Informed sources here say that the government crisis appeared to be approaching resolution last night, which will be resolved by the appointment of the leader of the Slovenian Party as Minister of Justice, the leader of the Socialist Party as Minister of Social Welfare, and the leader of the Peasant Party as Minister of Agriculture. (March 23rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Istanbul – After the Yugoslav Minister of Justice, the Minister of Social Welfare, and the Minister of Agriculture resigned one after another in opposition to the government's decision to join the Tripartite Pact, the newspapers here have commented on them. Among them, the semi-official "Ulus" newspaper stated that although Yugoslavia has a strong army of no less than one million men, its surrounding borders are almost entirely surrounded by the forces of the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact is nothing more than a ready-made suit that cannot fit all customers, so it has to be slightly modified for Yugoslavia. In other words, it means that Hungary and Bulgaria should abandon their territorial claims against Yugoslavia and limit the signatory countries to only passing through Yugoslavia with military equipment and ambulances. However, the Yugoslav government is still hesitant. When the cabinet met the night before, Prime Minister Cvetković refused to express his opinion, and Minister of the Army General Pećić also did not attend. All of these points are quite noteworthy. (March 21st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin – According to authoritative German sources, yesterday they refused to specify whether the Yugoslav cabinet dispute would delay the signing of the Tripartite Pact. Those sources even continued to say that there were negotiations between Germany and Yugoslavia, and that the resignation of three Yugoslav ministers was not necessarily directed against Germany. In fact, several of them are members of the Freemasons, and it is surprising that London attaches so much importance to this resignation. (March 23rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>

It is reported that the content is to reaffirm the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression pact and guarantee that "Soviet-Turkish friendship will not change when Turkey is at odds with other countries." It is also heard that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu assured the Yugoslav ambassador to Turkey yesterday that if Turkey can get the help of Britain and Greece if Yugoslavia is invaded, Turkey will help Yugoslavia. As for why the Soviet Union is willing to encourage Turkey, it is generally believed that it is to prevent Germany from attacking the Dardanelles Strait. (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Istanbul – Reliable sources here said yesterday that the Soviet Union has provided the Turkish government with a written guarantee that Turkey need not fear a Soviet attack if the political situation in Turkey deteriorates.

Although a Soviet-Turkish non-aggression pact exists, this new guarantee will place Soviet-Turkish relations on a firm and unshakable foundation. It is said that after the wording of the communiqué is finalized, this guarantee will be announced. People here believe that this development is of utmost importance, as it strengthens Turkey's domestic and foreign position and dispels its fears about the eastern frontier.

<p>London – It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Plymouth by enemy aircraft on Friday night, and hundreds of high-explosive bombs were also dropped. The intensity was greater than on Thursday. Enemy bombers indiscriminately wreaked havoc on residential and shopping areas, causing several areas to be reduced to ashes.

<p>London – After German planes launched fierce attacks on London and British ports, the British Air Force retaliated by launching fierce air raids on important bases that Hitler considered extremely relevant to naval warfare in the past week. Several towns in the Ruhr heavy industrial area were attacked. Due to bad weather, the air raids were limited to only a few nights. The shipyards of Emden and Wilhelmshaven in Germany were attacked twice, causing major fires. The industrial areas of Kiel and Bremen were also bombed. The Lorient submarine base in France was attacked twice, and coastal ships were attacked several times. Other targets, such as the Gelsenkirchen synthetic oil plant in Germany, the industrial area of Düsseldorf, and the railway freight yards, factories, and oil plants of Cologne, were also attacked, with lights illuminating the sky. The oil storage tanks in the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands were bombed four times, and the fire could be seen from 100 miles away on one night.

<p>Berlin – According to statistics released yesterday afternoon, 224,000 tons of British ships were sunk within 24 hours, setting a new record for German attacks on enemy ships. Of these, 116,000 tons were sunk by German ships in the Atlantic, 77,000 tons were sunk by German submarines near the west coast of Africa, and 31,000 tons were sunk by German planes in the Mediterranean, Ireland, and the east coast of Britain. German planes also severely damaged a 6,000-ton ship, which has almost sunk. (March 23rd Haitian News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – German capital ships sunk 116,000 tons of enemy merchant ships in a dense formation in the Atlantic, a pioneering feat in German naval history and the first time German capital ships have directly attacked the enemy's main lines of communication. At that time, enemy merchant ships were closely protected by capital ships and light warships, and German ships achieved results by attacking outnumbered.

<p>A Port in Eastern Canada – According to sailors on a cargo ship that recently arrived here yesterday, they fear that a British oil tanker and a cargo ship may have been sunk by enemy submarines off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. A few days ago, the two ships repeatedly sent distress signals, saying they were being attacked by a German submarine. There has been no news since. It is generally believed that Nazi submarines were operating 300 miles off the coast of Newfoundland a few days ago. (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London – News here today says that Germany is making Narvik a huge base for German submarines in the Atlantic. It is also reported that the railway from Narvik to Sweden is currently being repaired by the Germans. It is reported that the road is dedicated to transporting iron ore. (March 23rd International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London – According to a Reuters dispatch from Alexandria, the British Navy in the Mediterranean is undertaking the major task of intensifying the blockade and ensuring the safety of Allied ships during the war. According to a recent communiqué from the Navy, the sinking of Italian transport and supply ships by British submarines is only a part of the British Navy's work. Since the British Navy has control of the central and eastern Mediterranean, it can escort shells and bombs used to bomb Italian forces safely to various ports in Greece and the East and can also prevent Italian supplies from being transported to Albania and Tripoli. The German High Command is greatly alarmed to see the British naval power becoming increasingly stable and deliberately makes false propaganda that German torpedo planes have hit two Malayan battleships. In fact, there is absolutely no basis for this statement. (March 23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin: The German Minister of Economic Affairs, Lauk, announced Germany's new economic plan yesterday at a meeting of the Deutsche Bank, stating briefly that the economy should give private capital the opportunity to develop. At the same time, as a result of the war, there are some aspects of capital development that are blameworthy. Germany's war expenses are quite sufficient. In the sixteen months of combat, Germans have saved more money than last year. The new measures recently announced by the Price Management Committee are the main part of Germany's new wartime economy. The plan is to reduce prices and hand over wartime profits to the government. Reducing prices can stabilize the national economic life and enable all aspects of the economy to develop equally. This new measure does not completely abolish profits, it only prevents the sharp increase in prices. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: At the Deutsche Bank's regular meeting yesterday, General Hannigan reported on the state of raw materials in Germany, briefly stating that since Germany occupied the Western Front areas, steel production has increased by one and a half times.

<h3 id="e43">Syria: An Important Gateway to the Near East, Strategically Indispensable <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>New York: The long-range operational plans of the belligerent nations include a strategically important and little-known region, namely the small French-mandated territory of Syria. This territory includes five previously semi-autonomous states, separated from Turkey after the World War, whose independence was also recognized at that time, and which were managed by France under a League of Nations mandate. Syria's military importance lies entirely in its location. Syria is the gateway to the rich oilfields of Iraq, Iran, Soviet territory, and Arabia. It borders the Mediterranean Sea on the west, Iraq on the east, Turkey on the north, and Palestine on the south. Syria is ethnically diverse, with Arabs, Jews, Persians, Turks, Kurds, and Armenians, but the Arabs are the majority. The area is crossed by the Lebanon Mountains mentioned in the Bible, and it is located in the Euphrates River basin. After the fall of France, Italy paid great attention to Syria. Italy is eyeing the oil flowing through Syria and the large quantities of unused French military equipment stored there, and is thinking of seizing it. Last September, Italy demanded that the French naval base, airfield, and military center in Lebanon and Syria be transferred to the Italian army, but Italy's plan was unsuccessful because these had already been sold to the Lebanese government. In the first few months of the war, the elite of the French army gathered in Syria. Their training was supposed to be for fighting the Italians in North Africa, but they never had a chance to join the battle. General Weygand, who organized them, was recalled home in the spring of 1940 to lead the defeated French army. As a result, when France fell, the troops in Syria never had a chance to fight. Many leaders of the French army in Syria, young officers, were heartbroken by France's surrender. They still sympathize with England, and many of them crossed the border into British territory in Palestine. Britain hopes to persuade this once-powerful French army to join the battle again. At the beginning, it was estimated that the army had 200,000 to 250,000 trained soldiers, with the latest war equipment. Turkey also does not want to see Syria fall into Italian hands. Turkey has warned Italy not to try to take over the area. As a result of the British invasion of Libya, Italy's threat to Syria has obviously decreased. Britain's territory in the Near East is no longer in immediate danger of being attacked by the Axis powers, and Britain's prestige in the Muslim countries (including Syria) has therefore increased. Moreover, the British Mediterranean Fleet controls Syria's sea lanes, and the Italian Navy has not indicated that it wants to challenge Britain at sea. Syria is an agricultural country. The main agricultural products are wheat, barley, oats, rye, and cereals. Vegetables and fruits are also produced in abundance. Tobacco and cotton are also produced. There is also animal husbandry, as well as common mineral products. The population is one million, mostly Muslims, and the language is Arabic. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e44">Miscellaneous Talks on the European War (4) (1): General Discussion on European War Strategy <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>As a result, no fewer than forty divisions were concentrated on the sixty-mile line between Antwerp and Namur, reaching a density of one division per one and a half miles. But in the northeast of the Belgian-French border, the opposite was true, with only a small number of divisions, poorly qualified and lacking anti-tank guns, defending the area. In fact, one division had to defend twenty miles of the front.</p>
<p>Even more astonishing, when the German armored divisions charged out of the Ardennes near Sedan, the French forces defending the section of the road were not even defending it, and the bridges spanning the Meuse River fell into the hands of the Germans unscathed.</p>
<p>Because of these "inconceivable errors," the Germans were able to break through a large gap. Their progress was unexpectedly smooth, and the severe errors in the defenders' preparations had an even greater impact. Although France had suffered a painful experience in 1914, and Belgium's adherence to neutrality made it even more vulnerable to enemy attacks, the French army was still unprepared and did not build a line on the Belgian border that was comparable to the Maginot or Siegfried Line. At the same time, neither France nor Britain made any effort to organize armored divisions, preparing to immediately launch a vigorous counterattack when the front line was broken.</p>
<p>If we analyze the facts of the war in detail, we can see that the strength of the defense is still higher than I estimated. The German side tried its best to avoid making direct attacks on the enemy, and the French army's formal counterattacks almost all collapsed, resulting in heavy losses, so that later there was no continued resistance.</p>
<p>When the Germans attacked, they took advantage of gaps and broke through a section of the French line. They then used modern defensive arrangements to prevent the French army's attempt to cut off the "sea route" from being realized. The German army, with eight divisions, transported by motorcycle, advanced at lightning speed, and was able to defend this 100-mile-long area, blocking the French army's pincer attacks on both sides. Later, although the British army's flanks had been wiped out, and it fought alone, it was able to successfully retreat to Dunkirk, showing that when an army fights to the death with its back to the water, even if the strength is disparate, its resistance should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>I have made it very clear in my book "Defending Britain" that as for the offensive, it can be summarized in one sentence: only the offensive can occupy enemy countries or enemy positions, and force the enemy to beg for peace. To achieve this goal, the offensive occupies a major advantage psychologically. Because the offensive can maintain the initiative, and as long as the gains are commensurate with the power expended, it is nothing less than a tonic for one's own army.</p>
<p>But an offensive can only be adopted when the basic conditions for victory are met. At the beginning of the war, the British and French armies lacked the weapons necessary for an offensive. To adopt an offensive at that time would have been hopeless. The whole world should understand this now.</p>
<p>In the one or two years before the war, I advocated that we should adopt an "offensive defense." This was based on the practical principle of "doing what one can." Those in charge of preparing for war on the British and French sides mostly valued empty theories and practiced armchair strategy. Although they were logical and reasonable, they had nothing to do with the actual situation.</p>
<p>They did not develop the latest defensive tactics and how to implement them, and when training the army, they still focused on practicing unsuitable offensive methods, completely ignoring the word practical.</p>
<p>In my pre-war writings, I tried to define the necessary conditions for offense and defense. The German army carefully arranged things during the war preparation period and in the first year of the war in order to meet the conditions for successful attack, sparing no effort. The Allies were indifferent to meeting the conditions for successful defense. Comparing the two, the situation has been clearly judged. It is true that French morale was low, but the great tragedy that occurred last summer cannot be explained simply by this.</p>
<p>In addition to this failure to adapt to reality, the Allies' defensive efforts were hindered even more. This was not the fault of the army, but the fault of short-sighted politicians.</p>
<p>The safety of "defense in the West" for Britain and France depends on having a friendly Spain to protect their rear communication lines. This is a key point in my strategic defense theory. But the "non-intervention intervention policy" during the Spanish Civil War allowed Germany and Italy to dare to challenge the British navy, and allowed a faction that clearly hated Britain in the last world war to conquer the Spanish people.</p>
<p>To promote a collective security system to Eastern Europe, the support of the Soviet Union is essential. This is another key point in my strategic defense theory, which I have repeatedly emphasized. Unexpectedly, the British government, without first obtaining guarantees from the Soviet Union, rashly guaranteed the safety of strategically isolated Poland and Romania. This was the opposite of the policy of compromise and concession that had always been followed, and was indeed beyond the expectations of ordinary people. Once Hitler and the Soviet Union joined hands, he could have no worries about the west, and could adopt a sure-win offensive against Poland on the eastern front.</p>
<p>Therefore, the policies of the British and French governments completely violated the basis of the defensive strategy I advocated. They did not know how to defend by clearing the fields, which is the simplest and most effective way to frustrate the sharp edge of the attacking army, but instead gave Hitler the opportunity to break through weak points, allowing him to achieve initial victories.</p>
<p>What's worse is that if Britain and France wanted to fulfill their obligations and declare war, they would inevitably abandon defense and adopt an offensive in an unprepared and unfavorable situation. If they only made slight attempts against the Siegfried Line, it would be tantamount to showing their incompetence. If they attacked with all their strength, they would have to make heavy sacrifices and weaken the opportunity for future resistance.</p>
<p>The French army adopted a cautious offensive, which did no harm to the Siegfried Line, but because the war reports exaggerated too much, the later defeat greatly damaged the prestige of the Allied forces. In addition, the German army's blitzkrieg victory in Poland made the neutral countries more afraid of Germany and more shaken in their confidence in Britain and France than the Munich Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Eliminating Labor-Management Disputes Requires Stabilizing Workers' Lives; Wage Increases Followed by Price Increases: The Cycle of Passing On Still Harms Workers; Economic Commentator Ares Discusses Labor Strikes <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The famous economic commentator Ares published an article yesterday in the English-language "Great American Weekly," commenting on the recent labor strikes in Shanghai. He stated briefly that if the major industrialists and merchants in Shanghai continue to be as indifferent to the living conditions of workers as they have been in the past, then the occurrence of new labor-management conflicts in the future will be unavoidable. The recent transportation labor strike was mostly orchestrated by agitators. However, it would be wrong to think that the labor strike occurred entirely because of a conspiracy, because the reason why workers strike is because they are forced to make a living. During the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai workers were never behind in patriotism. Although their income was meager, they still actively made contributions. What they are most worried about now is the rising price of rice. Rice is their main food and one of their largest monthly expenses, because the cost of buying rice each month accounts for more than half of their monthly income. Therefore, any rise in the price of rice immediately has a major adverse impact on them.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices Make Life Difficult to Sustain</p>
<p>Millions of workers in Shanghai work from sunrise to deep night, averaging about twelve to thirteen hours of work per day. However, the wages they earn per hour are less than one American cent or half a British penny. Therefore, they often find themselves in a predicament where they cannot get enough food or warm clothes. In recent years, workers' wages have increased slightly, and there have been rice subsidies. From the surface, it seems that the compensation they currently receive is more than before the war. However, their wage income has only doubled, while prices have quadrupled. Wages often fail to keep pace with the cost of living.</p>
<p>High Profits, Harsh Treatment</p>
<p>However, at a time when prices have increased and the profits of industrialists and merchants have soared to unprecedented levels, treating workers so harshly is a disgrace to Shanghai, because the profits of large industrialists and merchants are obviously obtained by exploiting workers. The proportion of workers' wages in the cost is decreasing day by day, while the profits of capitalists are increasing. The loss of the workers is the gain of the capitalists. This is indeed unforgivable. The large industrialists and merchants of all countries should be held accountable for this.</p>
<p>Seeking a Reasonable and Fundamental Solution</p>
<p>If Shanghai's large industrialists and merchants intend to avoid disputes from occurring, then they should take constructive and proactive measures to deal with this problem. We do not deny that the wages workers receive are more than last year. However, the current price of rice has increased by 30% compared to three months ago. This alone is enough to increase workers' living expenses by 20%. Wages should rise with prices to be reasonable. However, large industrialists and merchants must not raise prices after increasing wages, as a way to make up for losses in one area by gains in another, because after doing so, workers' living expenses will increase again. With increased living expenses, workers cannot sustain themselves, and then they will make demands for wage increases. This cycle continues endlessly, and those who suffer losses will ultimately be the workers. If large industrialists and merchants want to prevent this situation from recurring, they should abandon past methods.</p>

<p>March 29 is the memorial day for the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. The National Government, due to this extraordinary period, has specifically stipulated that the memorial days of Deng Zhongyuan (March 23), Hu Hanmin (May 12), Chen Ying Shishi (May 18), Liao Zhongkai (August 20), Zhu Zhixin (September 21), and Huang Keqiang (October 31) be combined and held on the Huanghuagang Memorial Day, and has renamed it Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. People from all walks of life in this city, in order to commemorate the great achievements of the martyrs in creating the party and the country, and their loyalty and courage for the country, especially deeply mourn the martyrs during this time of war, and its significance is great. As the date approaches, they are actively preparing to lower the flags to half-mast throughout the city on that day, stop entertainment banquets, all agencies will take a day off, and voluntarily abstain from meat to express mourning, and practice frugal donations.</p>

Mr. Philip is currently in good health. According to reports, Philip was previously assassinated, but suffered no harm and still goes to the bureau to work every day.</p>
<p>Public Transportation in the French Concession May Resume Today: Prolonged Insistence Will Result in Losses for Both Sides; Resume Work First, Then Discuss Conditions</p>
<p>After the French tram company's labor strike began on the 19th, public transportation has been completely suspended for many days, causing great inconvenience to citizens. Although the French Police Department's Political Affairs Department has repeatedly mediated, the labor side insists that work can only resume after the arrested workers are released. As a result, the rumors that the labor side would resume work and transportation would return to normal the day before yesterday turned out to be false. It is now known that the authorities have not regarded the labor strike as a stalemate, and have been working hard to mediate it in recent days. According to news obtained yesterday, the labor side also believes that a prolonged stalemate will not only result in losses for both labor and management, but also have a great impact on society. Therefore, it no longer insists on its original views, and the management is now also making concessions. The labor strike has eased. It is said that today (the 24th), the labor side will resume work first, and then labor and management will openly discuss the conditions. At the same time, after work resumes, the arrested workers will also be released at the same time. Therefore, transportation within the French Concession may resume today. As for the Chinese workers' strike at the water and electricity plant, the operation was still maintained by White Russian workers yesterday, so the supply of water and electricity in the French Concession was not affected in any way. The French police have not relaxed their vigilance in various places.</p>

<p>Although the authorities of the two concessions have not yet announced specific and effective measures to stabilize the people's food, the problem is currently being studied in detail by Mr. Mitchell, the British Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Minsde, the American Director. It is said that the authorities are about to convene the people in charge of rice industry groups to discuss everything in order to implement effective measures. Regarding the aspect of clearing channels for supply, they will contact the foreign rice firms and transportation industries in this city to ensure that proper measures are obtained, so that this serious problem can be permanently stabilized.</p>
<p>Huge Amount of Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the French Concession discussed increasing the number of ships to transport Vietnamese rice to Shanghai with the French shipping company and achieved satisfactory results, the number of French ships carrying rice to Shanghai has been increasing day by day. Yesterday, the Sairo arrived with 24,000 bags. According to news from the rice industry, the French shipping company's Dada Nan is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 25th). The ship is carrying as much as 70,000 bags of tribute rice.</p>
<p>Other ships continuing to transport rice from Vietnam to Shanghai include Jin Diya and others. The Kai Ting and Luo Si, which left this port yesterday and the day before yesterday, are also sailing to Vietnam to transport rice and grain to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Afternoon Trading Should Be Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>When the price of rice soared last year, the Shanghai Grain Industry Association prohibited afternoon rice trading. However, speculators have relapsed and secretly traded in the afternoon. As a result, after the speculative parties fanned the flames yesterday afternoon, the black market prices in the morning became even higher. The ban should be reiterated immediately, and strict investigations and prohibitions should be carried out.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Polish Women's League of this city recently hosted a joint committee of the Shanghai Women's League at the Polish Legation, during which Salvation Army Brigadier Ma Ruishan spoke on the issue of beggar asylums. Ma gave an overview of the asylum's history, saying that finding a suitable location was quite difficult, but eventually the current site at 11 Singapore Road was found, and operations quickly commenced.</p>
<p>More Than Four Hundred People, Half of Whom Are Women</p>
<p>The asylum now houses 451 people, including 280 women. Many of these beggars are from good families and have received education. A few were once teachers and technicians, and one even studied medicine. Blind beggars live in a separate building, where Mr. Flau and an assistant from the city's School for the Blind teach them various means of earning a living. Blind beggar children have been moved to the Hongqiao School for the Blind for care and education. The most difficult to handle are beggars with missing limbs, but they have also been assigned suitable work.</p>
<p>Food Supply Is Sometimes Precarious</p>
<p>All items brought in by beggars are kept by the asylum staff and returned when the beggars leave. The most difficult problem faced by the asylum authorities is the food supply. Maintaining each beggar requires 30 yuan per month, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the asylum to obtain rice. At one point, it was impossible to obtain rice, making it difficult to sustain operations. If the asylum authorities cannot provide food and drink, they will have to open the doors and let the beggars fend for themselves.</p>

It is generally believed that the Municipal Council is responding to the requests of foreign residents to postpone the 1941 annual election of council members from April 2nd and 3rd to April 9th and 10th. It is reported that foreign residents are currently discussing the next Council members. It is believed that if the Consular Body approves the extension of the annual election, the foreign residents will continue discussions in order to reach an understanding that will avoid the need for an election.</p>

<p>Since the Public Concession implemented electricity conservation measures, the French Concession authorities have also considered this issue several times. The Municipal Council has now decided to advise residents in the Concession to conserve electricity. In the past few days, personnel have been dispatched to investigate advertising lights, such as neon lights, in various businesses within the Concession, and the investigation has been completed. It is now known that starting today, all advertising lights of shops in the French Concession that the authorities deem to consume excessive electricity will be prohibited.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Providing Flour to Relieve Food Shortages; Meritorious Service to Society; More Than Five Thousand Bags Distributed Daily at Cost <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Amid rampant rice speculation and soaring black market prices, the food problem has reached a critical point, threatening overall social stability. One thing deserves public praise and should be commended for its encouraging effect: the sale of flour at fair prices, which has been relied upon in recent years to relieve the food crisis for ordinary people. The sale of flour at fair prices was initiated by the Chinese-owned Fufeng and Fuxin factories in 1929. It was then publicly sold at fair prices in January 1940. Except for occasional suspensions due to interruptions in raw material supplies, it continues to this day.</p>
<p>Continuing Fair Price Sales</p>
<p>Currently, the Fufeng factory provides 1,059 bags of flour for fair price sales. Although raw material supplies have been interrupted and temporarily suspended, the Fuxin factory still distributes 5,873 bags of flour daily (the Municipal Council supplements this by 8,318 bags of foreign flour daily, five days a week, which are distributed to various stalls, restaurants, and bakeries).</p>
<p>The fair price is only the cost of 25 yuan per bag, which is 7 or 8 yuan less than the market price of 32 or 33 yuan per bag. Based on the current supply of 250,000 bags of foreign wheat flour,</p>
<p>Sacrificing Profits</p>
<p>The loss of profits is close to 2 million yuan. Although the factory can continue to supply flour at fair prices until late April, it is still negotiating to procure American wheat in order to continue supplying flour until the new wheat arrives. Fuxin is shouldering this huge responsibility alone, and the factory manager, Mr. Wang Yuqing, is managing the difficulties and benefiting the common people. This is a rare and great undertaking in this isolated island. Therefore, Mr. Fei, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, and Mr. He, the Chinese Director-General, have repeatedly commended him. A certain Western newspaper even praised it as a</p>
<p>Great Achievement</p>
<p>And said that in addition to his efforts to sell flour at fair prices, Mr. Wang has also made advance payments and donations to help stabilize rice prices. His achievements are indeed indelible. The recent drop in flour prices is a direct result of the fair price flour sales. Even the rice market, which is so severe, has not experienced any significant incidents, which is also deeply related to the fair price flour sales. This is because 30% of Shanghai's more than 4 million residents are Northern compatriots and overseas Chinese, all of whom rely on flour for their livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Fundraising for the Bank Employee Shooting Case; The Zhengyan Newspaper Donates 1,000 Yuan to Start the Effort; While Seeking to Rescue the Kidnapped Bank Employees <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 21st of this month, in the dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank employees on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, thugs broke in, forced the employees to line up, and opened fire, killing six people on the spot and one person who died after being sent to the hospital. This resulted in the "March 21st" tragedy. Less than three hours after this tragedy, more than one hundred employees of the Bank of China were kidnapped at No. 96 Jessfield Road. Everyone has parents, wives, and children. How can they bear this? The Zhengyan Newspaper has initiated a fundraising effort of 100,000 yuan to provide compensation to the families of the victims of the "March 21st" tragedy and has taken the lead by donating 1,000 yuan. People from China and abroad are expected to sympathize. The Jiangsu Farmers Bank will be the collection agency, and the newspaper will publish the list of donors. At the same time, efforts will be made to rescue the kidnapped Bank of China employees and to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies.</p>
<p>Improving Condition</p>
<p>In addition to the six Jiangsu Farmers Bank employees who died on the spot from gunshot wounds—Chu Hualong, Xue Yushan, Zhang Shaozhen, Fan Jingjiang, Wan Deyi, and Dai Daguan—Xi Shen also died after being sent to the Guangci Hospital. The four seriously injured—Cheng Xiuming, Li Yawen, Zhang Shusen, and Shen Yongzuo—are still being treated at the Guangci Hospital. It is reported that after the doctors performed surgery, their condition has improved and their lives are expected to be saved.</p>
<p>Strict Protection</p>
<p>It is also reported that after the kidnapping of employees at the Bank of China's dormitory on Jessfield Road on the same night, some of the employees have been released. It is said that those who were released were mistakenly kidnapped. The French police have stationed two armored vehicles, numbers 25 and 30, in front of the bank's Avenue Joffre branch for strict protection. The Public Concession police have also dispatched detectives to guard the branches of the bank to provide protection.</p>
<p>Suspicious Car Found</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 1 a.m., a green car suddenly parked for a long time in front of the Bank of China's Xinzha Road office at No. 420 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. The detective stationed there suspected something was wrong and intended to question the driver, but the driver suddenly sped away. The detective later reported the information to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e55">I Think of Three Three Four <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Xifu</p>
<p>I'm afraid many pedestrians haven't noticed that near the foot of the western wall outside the entrance of the racecourse on Bubbling Well Road stands a milestone about two feet tall. Engraved on it is a line of English which reads: "One mile to the Bund from here."</p>
<p>Boarding a public bus, one glance reveals about twenty or so people in the carriage. Everyone is lazily leaning against the seatback, the bus rattling noisily, even the joints in the bones are being shaken. The bus travels only seven or eight minutes, conquering the mile long distance.</p>
<p>The statue of Chabrier at the Nanjing Road end of the Bund is mottled and speckled from head to foot, from a distance it appears to be draped in a fuzzy sort of fur coat, not colorful, but very apt for the time of year. This "iron heart" also decorates the spring scenery beside the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Outside the park entrance, the most striking, lively and moving things are the public phone booths. A splash of red color, those who don't know might suspect they're small fire stations.</p>
<p>Between not-three-not-four o'clock (the customs clock at three, my watch at four) I spent six five-cent pieces, and stepped into the Bund Park. To the right, a pair of little clay figures are holding umbrellas on the artificial hill, appearing to be sheltering from the rain. In reality, if it were really raining, they would be the first to need a change of clothes. As we're "old acquaintances," I won't be too critical of the children!</p>
<p>Turning to walk to a big altar on the left, a small wooden block declares "Single Earlrz Tulip." The purple-orchid colored ones, and the blue-yellow-red intermingled ones, are arranged sparsely and clearly. Because they've only just been watered by the gardener, the surrounding soil is still moist and rich, bring your nose closer and you can feel a breath of fresh air seeping from the soil, evaporated by the sunlight. It seems it can be named the "earthy breath of spring," and relaxes the chest.</p>
<p>Raising my head, I look afar at the vehicles and pedestrians on the Garden Bridge busily coming and going; the big and small steamers on the Huangpu River, belching black smoke, the gray warships… everything seems to have leaped out of the constraints of time, utterly "unchanging." My head throbs again.</p>
<p>Only minding to saunter forwards, I clearly see several pairs of young men and women scattered over the chairs, however, who still has the enthusiasm to go and observe them? Each of the chairs is connected in a long row, section by section like a large string of sausages. Fat ones, thin ones, after having been blown by the river breeze and illuminated by the sunshine warm yet tinged with heat, although they won't all necessarily be sweating, that everyone's face is coated in oiliness is, however, a fact.</p>
<p>Unawares, I walked to the northeast corner, to a flat and wide cement platform, where a line of six or seven rattan tables have been placed, seated around which are two, three, four, five, people, inconsistently. Half Western, half Chinese, wearing clothes of different ranks. The most arresting thing is a Westerner sticking out his large belly. Other than his upper clothes, he only wears a vest, a cigar is clamped in his mouth, and he's playing cards with a thin, lanky man. The two of them are sitting opposite each other, draped their taken-off clothes on the backs of the empty chairs in-between them. The two heads will now and again incline together, almost touching; but then they split apart as if estranged, hugging the chair backs, heads raised. Hands gripping the cards, raised high before the eyes. The distance between the two heads is fully half a丈 away, and so the upper bodies again bend and soften downwards, like candles lit on a hot day, and unconsciously the bodies stretch down, and three cards, two cards at a time are spread and slapped down on the table. In such a process of wavering instability, the two people are, however, wordlessly silent. Like they are rushing to complete some task that they aren't necessarily interested in but have to in some period of time.</p>
<p>Leaning on the corner, beside the table of a forty-something year old woman who is a half-caste Westerner, when the waiter came with drinks, I asked about the background of the two card playing Westerners.</p>
<p>"Hmph… Jews!" A very unnatural sounding reply. Going on, I also asked:</p>
<p>"They look like regular customers?" "Spending three mao for a cup of tea (sugar and milk included), that table is sold to them the whole day."</p>
<p>It was not necessary to ask further, that waiter grumbled again for a while.</p>
<p>At the table one table over to the right are two special constables, the number on one of the epaulettes is a triple-number, a glance at it and it is easy to remember, that aside. On the table are two Sarsae soft drink bottles. One gulp remains in a glass. The two button their collars, straighten their uniforms, and swagger away. Following that, there came a Westerner carrying a large leather bag in his right hand, and a rectangular box tucked under his left arm. The grease stain on his hat was almost like summer asphalt, and the leather shoes on his feet were unquestionably the valiant performers of a journey of ten thousand li. He brushed past the plump Western woman seated before my seat, and walked to the seat where the two constables had been. He put down the big leather bag with one hand, and at once tossed the glass that was left with one gulp of Sarsae soft drink to his mouth.</p>
<p>With a Chaplin-esque, strained smile faintly floating on his face, he put down the box, took off his coat, and slumped down. He glanced around, and gave a nod or a shake of the head as if greeting the plump woman beside him. After two minutes, he stood up and walked to the candy counter inside, and bought a Tom Boy brand chocolate bar for three mao. And he requested a half-glass of free filtered water. The two hands gripping this "source of life," he returned to his original seat. Drinking cool water, biting chocolate, the smile floating on his face, little by little, changed from dry and moist, and diffused from the local territory of the ends of the eyebrows and eyes to the entire head. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness in my heart, looking at the timepiece on my wrist, it was precisely four and a half o'clock daylight savings time, ah!</p>
<p>The plump Westerner was wearing dark green upper clothes, and a brownish-grey skirt. There were two pockets beside the waist, all zippered, five or six inches long. On the table was a black leather bag, swollen to almost the same size as its owner's body. She first took out a small mirror, and held it before her face, looking at it again and again. And she applied her blood-red lipstick endlessly. The redder the lips, the more terrible the two dark circles around her eyes appeared. However, the Westerner beside her, had emptied his glass of cool water, and the chocolate had disappeared. As if he'd eaten a grand meal of seven or eight courses, he appeared very satisfied, and with a slouched posture, expressed a desiring look. He began to chat with this "pious-type" of woman. As a result, this Westerner pulled a business card out of her leather bag to show him, and without a doubt told him her address and name.</p>
<p>The time they talked for was not short, I saw two Indians, one with a bright peach-colored silk scarf wrapped around his head, one with a yellow one, the two were circling the park, and had probably passed the platform three times already. The man carrying the big leather bag only then cordially took his leave of the plump woman. At this time, another three or four American sailors came, and several Western men and women, the sailors were taking pictures, each full of vigor, smiles on their faces, but on the look of it, it always felt that their uniforms were too narrow, the muscles all over their bodies were almost about to burst out of the clothes.</p>
<p>I left the place for tea, went around the outdoor pavilion circled by short trees on the right, and on a small lawn, I saw two Western girls, and a middle-aged man, frolicking and playing there, after pushing each other around for a while they laughed uncontrollably. Two Chinese women, and a richly dressed young woman passed by, they walked calmly on the lawn, with a slight smile on their faces, as if they were pointing at the two Western girls, and criticizing something with a smirk. The impression given by these three women, was exactly like three tins of tinned fruit, their own color, fragrance, and flavor were all locked up inside, and the beautiful decoration on the surface was not at all their own. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Bund Crowd Scenes</p>
<p>This scene is from the point of view of the "Peace Statue," and is a panorama of the Bund looking south to north, the main buildings have all been collected here, the HSBC building is like a bald old man, full of veteran power. The customs clock is like a lanky guy, his voice especially loud. The Bank of China Building beside the Cathay Hotel, is now near to completion, and is half a head taller than the "Sassoon's" skullcap.</p>

<p>After the market for various types of briquettes and lump coal in this city has been quietly manipulated and monopolized by one or two large coal companies, the market is worsening day by day. In addition, the appetite of general businesses is quite strong, and the small amount of spot goods on the market cannot meet the balance of supply and demand. People's hearts are extremely volatile, and market prices are rising. Among them, the price of bituminous coal dust has risen the most sharply. For example, Hongji No. 2 dust has risen to 178 yuan per ton, Indian dust requires 250 yuan, and Kai Ping dust is 120 yuan (factory price). The coal price has risen so high because speculative coal merchants are manipulating and monopolizing the market. The authorities' punishment of speculative coal merchants cannot be delayed any longer. Otherwise, the future of the coal market will continue to deteriorate. The one or two large coal companies are wantonly ravaging the market, hoping to raise prices for profit, and are turning a blind eye to external circumstances and the authorities' public notices. They are also falsely claiming that the goods in their warehouses have been sold to various businesses after they are completed, while at the same time refusing to stockpile goods for the market.</p>
<p>Dispatching Cables to Various Places; Coal by the Kilo Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the shipping of foreign coal, the authorities of the two concessions have tried to dredge the canal. In addition to sending cables to the governments of coal-producing areas such as India and Vietnam to release large quantities of bituminous coal, briquettes and dust to Shanghai, coal ships are also being loaded one after another in an attempt to ship large quantities of coal to Shanghai to balance and stabilize the market. Therefore, there is no risk of interruption to the source of bituminous coal. According to coal industry sources, the coal stockpiles in the Pudong, Hongkou, and western Shanghai areas of the city are still extremely abundant, estimated to be more than 400,000 tons, enough for three and a half months of fuel for the city's various industries and residents. The daily arrivals in recent days are enough for daily use. Therefore, the abundance of coal stockpiles is undeniable.</p>
<p>Quantity of Coal Shipped to Shanghai Last Month</p>
<p>A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that the customs has completed its statistics on the quantity of foreign coal shipped to Shanghai from abroad in February of this year, totaling 92,559 metric tons, worth 744,804 gold units, equivalent to 2,016,184 yuan in national currency. Among them, Vietnam accounted for the most, with 30,159 metric tons, worth 367,361 gold units. Japan was second, with 25,763 metric tons, worth 77,743 gold units. Taiwan was third, with 20,713 metric tons, worth 62,764 gold units. British India was fourth, with 15,912 metric tons, worth 236,808 gold units. Therefore, the claim that the source of coal is blocked is purely unfounded.</p>

As a result, one robber was captured alive, and one robber was shot in the chest and shoulder and fell to the ground. Two guns were seized. The remaining two robbers managed to escape. The injured robber was taken by ambulance to the police hospital for treatment. It is reported that the silk shop suffered only minor losses.</p>

<p>Huaguang News Agency reports that due to the failure of workers in the dyeing and weaving industry in this city to obtain subsidies from the management in the early part of the month, all workers declared a strike. However, the workers of the Meifeng Dyeing Factory at No. 112 Binlang Road continued to work as usual and were unwilling to respond to the strike. Hundreds of members of the dyeing and weaving workers' union considered the Meifeng Factory workers to be deliberately undermining the unity of the strike and gathered at the factory, destroying machinery. Afterwards, the manager of the factory, Que Pingzhi, reported to the police station, who dispatched a large number of detectives and arrested 57 workers, who were sent to the Special First Court and sentenced to ten days of detention. Unexpectedly, a similar incident occurred at the Yixin Dyeing Factory at No. 1, Lane 380 Kangti Road in the French Concession the day before yesterday. More than one hundred striking workers broke into the factory and destroyed most of the machinery. Afterwards, the manager of the factory, Yan Youli (30 years old, local), reported to the French police station, who dispatched a large number of detectives and arrested the workers on the spot: Cui Changfa, Tang Shengtian, Chen Changsheng, Wang Shigen, Ma Changgen, Long Er, Huang Shoukang, Zhou Zhaogen, Yu Jinguan, Ma Arong, Hua Huosheng, and Li Bingsheng. The workers were all taken to the police station for detention. Afterwards, the French Political Department and the industry's workers' union came forward to mediate. The workers demanded that the factory be responsible for bailing out the twelve arrested workers. Although the manager of the Yixin Dyeing Factory, Yan Youli, can waive the criminal charges, he proposed that the workers must compensate for the loss of the destroyed machinery. Therefore, the case is still deadlocked between the two sides. The strike of all workers in the dyeing industry has not yet been resolved and is currently being actively mediated.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Crisis of Japanese Finance <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Demao</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Japanese finance is a strong-looking but weak-inside country in peacetime. Now that the Sino-Japanese War has been going on for three years and seven months, Japanese finance is becoming increasingly difficult, which is undeniable. At this point, when they are at the end of their rope, they even pass an unprecedentedly huge budget and still want to struggle, brazenly advancing south in an attempt to make a last-ditch effort. However, they are terminally ill and there is nothing they can do but accelerate the date of their collapse. Now, let us review its past evolution and future trends.</p>
<p>The first financial crisis Japan encountered in its history was during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. At that time, Japan spent 2 billion yen in military expenses to defeat Imperial Russia. However, Japan could not fully bear this huge amount, so Japan's finances were in an unsustainable situation. Finally, Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo went to the United States and used the joint development of Manchuria and Mongolia and the operation of the South Manchurian Railway as bait to lure American capitalists to purchase its public bonds. As a result, nearly 1 billion yen of military expenses were underwritten by the United States, which helped them to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, the second financial crisis in Japan gradually began again. Originally, the expansion of the military budget was simply like a hot air balloon, a little  affected. We see that in 1931, the total amount of Japan's financial expenditure was only 1.476 billion yen, of which military expenditure accounted for only 31% (454 million yen). However, in the following year of the incident, it jumped to 1.95 billion yen, and the amount of military expenditure increased to 686 million yen. By 1933, its financial budget exceeded the 2 billion yen mark (2.254 billion yen), and the proportion of military expenditure also increased from 31% to 39%. This is such an alarming increase!</p>
<p>After 1933, Japan's annual financial budget continued to increase like a flying rocket. In 1936, it increased to 2.3 billion yen, setting a new record in the country's financial history! People from all walks of life in the country were all frightened and angry. The cabinet was therefore replaced many times. As a result, after repeated reductions, it was still 2.8 billion yen, of which military expenditure accounted for 1.4 billion yen, almost reaching half of the total budget.</p>
<p>However, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred in July 1937. In order to increase military expenditure, Japan specially submitted a war budget of 500 million yen to the parliament, thinking that it could solve the war and achieve the goal of conquering China. Who knew that the "August 13th" War broke out and evolved into a full-scale war. The huge war expenses could not be borne by the ordinary accounting budget, so they simply separated the war expense budget and compiled another type of budget, which is what they called the special accounting budget (referred to as the China Incident Expense). In September, they added 2 billion yen to the parliament. Then, the ordinary accounting budget for 1937 was 2.8 billion yen, and the special budget was 2.5 billion yen, totaling 5.3 billion yen.</p>
<p>By 1938, the ordinary accounting budget was also 2.8 billion yen, but the special accounting budget expanded to 4.8 billion yen, plus three additional budgets of 640 million yen, totaling 8.3 billion yen, an increase of more than one and a half times compared with the 1937 figure. In 1939, the ordinary accounting budget was 4.8 billion yen, an increase of 2 billion yen over the previous year, and the special accounting budget was 4.6 billion yen, totaling 9.4 billion yen. By 1940, the ordinary accounting budget was 5.823 billion yen, an increase of about 1 billion yen over the previous year, and the special accounting budget was 4.46 billion yen, totaling 10.3 billion yen. The huge amount, although it cannot be said to be unprecedented, can also be said to be the first of its kind. Just taking the special accounting budget as an example, it increased by 11 times compared with the special accounting budget during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, and increased by as much as 82 times compared with the special accounting budget during the "January 28th" Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>As for Japan's 1941 budget, it was passed by the parliament on December 10 of the previous year. According to the published estimate, the total amount of the ordinary accounting budget reached 6.863 billion yen, an increase of 1.04 billion yen compared with the ordinary accounting budget amount of the previous year. This figure is naturally unprecedentedly large in Japanese financial history. The special accounting budget is 4.88 billion yen, and the ordinary accounting budget has reached a huge amount of 11.74 billion yen, which is an increase of ten times compared with Japan twenty years ago. But at that time, it was the peak of Japan's prosperity, but now it has reached the extreme of poverty. However, the huge amount of money is a huge problem for the authorities in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous expansion of Japan's annual military expenditure, the source of financial income has to be distributed to the national people, and it is impossible to keep pace with the military expenditure. Therefore, Japanese finance has to take the path of issuing national debt, that is, so-called deficit public bonds, increasing taxes, and issuing banknotes. From then on, Japanese finance exposed a deformed state. Originally, the main part of the expenditure was military expenditure, the second part was national debt expenditure, and the rest was other expenditure. What about the income? Tax revenue accounts for half, and loans and miscellaneous income also account for half. In short, there is no difference in what is taken from the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Although Japan's foreign debt is decreasing year by year, its internal debt is increasing by leaps and bounds. In 1926, Japan's public debt was only 5.00162 billion yen, and in 1931, it was only 6.187 billion yen. However, by 1936, the total public debt broke the 10 billion yen mark. In 1937, Japan decided to issue 800 million yen of public debt (originally 960 million yen, but later reduced by 160 million yen). After the "July 7th" Incident, Japan additionally issued 410 million yen of public debt. Later, the temporary parliament passed more than 2 billion yen of the "China Incident Expense." In this way, the total amount of Japan's national debt has actually been close to 14 billion yen, equivalent to the total national income.</p>
<p>In 1938, 4.45 billion yen of the special accounting budget of 4.8 billion yen was also dependent on public debt. The public debt part of the ordinary accounting budget in 1938 was 866 million yen, totaling 5.316 billion yen, plus 1.49 billion yen that had not been issued in 1937. Then, the amount to be issued in 1938 was as much as 6.8 billion yen. Statistics show that the total amount of Japanese public debt has reached 10 billion yen. Since then, Japanese public debt has increased rather than decreased. As of the end of November last year, the accumulated amount of public debt reached about 26.9 billion yen. Moreover, 3.997 billion yen of the 4.88 billion yen in the special accounting budget for this year (1941-42) is issued in public debt. Therefore, there is no doubt that the amount of Japanese public debt issued will increase rather than decrease in the future. However, according to the former famous Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo, "The saturation point of Japanese public debt cannot exceed 10 billion yen." Now it has exceeded the limit by about three times, which shows that its financial difficulties are deepening day by day, and the financial crisis is also exposed.</p>
<p>As for the issuance routes of Japanese public debt, there are two: one is through banks, which sell them to the people, and the amount that can be sold is advanced by the bank; the other is through the Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which uses the deposit and postal deposits accepted by the bureau to digest them. However, the current amount of Japanese public debt issued has reached the saturation point, which can be seen from the following facts. Originally, the amount of public debt that Japan had repeatedly planned to issue in recent years, the actual number of issues, has not reached the budgeted number, and the decoupling of the public debt cycle has also been exposed. The promotion of public debt, due to the exhaustion of national economic power, cannot be fully accepted, that is, the banks themselves cannot fully digest it. Here is an example to illustrate that last year, the amount of Japanese public debt issued was 6.665 billion yen, of which 1.85 billion yen was distributed by the Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance; of which 4.815 billion yen was distributed by banks; as a result, a total of 4.838 billion yen was digested, accounting for 72% of the issued amount. What about this year? The ordinary accounting budget reached 6.863 billion yen, which is 1.04 billion yen more than the previous year. If there is another one or two additional budgets, based on the previous year, about 300 million yen, then the ordinary accounting budget will definitely reach 13 billion yen, breaking the highest record in previous years. As for the special accounting budget, it is 4.88 billion yen, which is 420 million yen more than the previous year. Therefore, the total of the two budgets in Japan this year is 1.7 billion yen more than the previous year, and the amount of public debt to be issued this year will inevitably reach 8 billion yen. In the state of national poverty and exhaustion, whether public debt can be issued in large quantities has become a major question. Moreover, Japan still has 5 billion yen of public debt accumulated in the treasury of the Ministry of Finance, and 1.8 billion yen could not be digested last year, so it is conceivable that the unsale rate this year will be even greater.</p>
<p>The second method for Japan to cope with the huge expenditure is to increase taxes, but the increase in tax revenue is not the growth of the people's ability to pay taxes. In fact, it is a general increase in various tax rates in the tax department. Every time the annual budget expands, the Japanese financial authorities have to increase taxes once. Since the "July 7th" Incident, Japan has implemented four large-scale tax increases. I remember a newspaper reporter once said a joke, saying that "Now in Japan, perhaps only the air is not taxed." In fact, this sentence is not a joke, but it shows that Japan's tax increase is already exhausted. Originally, the new tax passed by the 75th Parliament also included taxes on chafer beetles. It seems that in the past four years, the annual tax burden of the Japanese people has been impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is futile to issue 6 billion yen of public debt and attempt to increase tax revenue by 500 million yen to make up for it. Moreover, increasing taxes is often more troublesome in legislative and administrative procedures, and the results obtained are not as great as issuing public debt and issuing banknotes. Therefore, at the current stage, the Japanese financial authorities have adopted a policy of issuing public debt and banknotes at the same time in order to make up for the huge expenditure.</p>
<p>The increase in public debt is the advance payment of the future income of the people. Therefore, the larger the amount of public debt issued, the greater the debt of each citizen. As for increasing taxes, it is biased towards the burden of the working masses, and it will not reduce the wealth of the wealthy people. In addition to public debt and tax increases, Japan also has to increase the issuance of banknotes to cope with the huge expenditure. We can get a glimpse of the process of Japanese banknote inflation from the following figures.</p>
<p>Before the war, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was no more than 1.64 billion yen at the end of June 1937. By the end of the same year, it had increased to 2.305 billion yen, an increase of 665 million yen in six months. In 1938, the highest amount reached 2.755 billion yen. In 1939, it rose to an unprecedented figure of 3.817 billion yen, and naturally about 500 to 600 million yen were returned to the Bank of Japan. Therefore, at the end of January last year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was reduced to 3.27 billion yen. Afterwards, due to the magic of finance, by the end of November, it had increased to 3.75 billion yen, and by the end of December, it had reached 4.817 billion yen. However, the actual number is more than this, because after the implementation of the old convertible note reorganization law and the expansion of the guarantee money of the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan in April last year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan in May increased by 115 million yen compared with the previous year's figure. Therefore, as of the end of last year, the total amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan has reached 3.932 billion yen, which is an increase of nearly one and a half times compared with the 1.64 billion yen before the war.</p>
<p>Japan, regardless of the amount of reserves, desperately issuing banknotes, will naturally cause malignant inflation, stimulating price increases, making people's lives more and more difficult. The rise in prices is the inevitable result of currency inflation and tax increases. How high are Japanese prices? According to Katsuta Sadatsugu, a Japanese, "This year, Japanese prices have risen at least three times compared with the previous year, but Japanese prices in the previous year were already three times higher than before the war, so Japanese prices now are at least nine times higher than usual." Due to the rise in prices, the national life will become more and more painful, thus affecting the health of the people.</p>
<p>At present, the Japanese financial authorities are trying to make public debt digestion smooth in order to avoid malignant currency inflation. The main methods for digesting public debt are nothing more than encouraging savings and restricting loans, so that the banking industry can buy public debt as much as possible. However, we know that under the heavy pressure of layers of heavy taxes and high prices, where can the Japanese people have spare money to save? The people's livelihood has become extremely difficult, and the national economy is declining along with the general economic decline, and bank deposits are even more reduced. In the past, the authorities used the deposits of various banks to purchase public debt. At that time, in order to obtain greater profits, the banks naturally wanted to undertake loans. Who knew that after the war, the wartime fund adjustment law was promulgated, depriving the banks of the right to freely lend, trying to encourage the people to save as much as possible in order to increase the deposits of the banks. Now, the bank deposits have decreased instead, making it more difficult to digest public debt. Not only can it not compress currency inflation, but it will also suffer from it even more. Therefore, Japan's national power is exhausted, and even if it drains the pond to get all the fish, it may not be able to cope with the unprecedented budget. When that time comes, the public debt cannot be digested, and it can only issue banknotes to fill the war expenses. The result will not only promote its financial bankruptcy, but also the inability to continue the war and the failure is predictable.</p>

<h3 id="e69">The Problem of Liquid Fuels in England and Germany <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>"A drop of kerosene is more precious than a drop of human blood!" The heart-stirring famous saying of the famous German general Hindenburg must still be lingering in our minds, right? Those national leaders who are concerned about the security of their own countries have always been eager to develop kerosene, study its substitutes, purchase it, and store it, fearing to fall behind. There is no need to explain this any further. This long-term competition between England and Germany is certainly not yet known who will win, but whether the storage of liquid fuel is sufficient or not, and whether the subsequent supply and replenishment are difficult or not, will undoubtedly be one of the important factors in determining the outcome.</p>
<p>According to statistics: Before the war, the average annual consumption of kerosene and kerosene products in the United Kingdom was 12 million tons; Germany's consumption was smaller, but it also needed 6 million tons. The consumption of liquid fuel during the war will certainly far exceed this number, and it is quite difficult to estimate. Dr. Steinberg of Germany estimated that Germany should consume 12 million to 3 million tons of liquid fuel in a year of war, according to the degree of mechanization in Germany at the beginning of the war. However, under the mass production and vigorous production of airplanes, submarines, and tanks, who can know what stage it will need to reach in the future? England should consume 24 million to 6 million tons in a year of war if it uses twice as much as usual. England needs to import almost all of it from other places. According to the Romanian government's report in 1937, the kerosene production in Germany in that year was 486,000 tons, and according to the monthly statistical report of the International Federation, the kerosene production in Germany in 1939 was only 700,000 tons. Compared with the huge number needed during the war, it is really small! Therefore, the urgent situation of Germany and England needing to obtain enough liquid fuel from foreign countries or other methods is only a difference of ninety steps and one hundred steps!</p>
<p>Looking around the countries in the world that produce the most kerosene, according to the monthly statistical report of the League of Nations, the production from July 1938 to June 1939: (tons)</p>
<p>In addition to its own use, the Soviet Union's kerosene production is about 10 million tons, which can be supplied to belligerent countries or other neutral countries; Romania and Poland can also supply a part; however, this is still far from the number of kerosene actually needed by the two belligerent countries: where can this shortfall be compensated? The number that can be made up for by the Asian producing areas is quite considerable, but the one with the highest production in the world, which can be taken endlessly and used exhaustively, is neither British nor American. When it comes to the preparation of liquid fuel by the two countries before the war, England has its entire and systematic plan: British Borneo, India, Burma, and Malaya produce 18 million tons annually, and eight or nine out of ten are in England's bag. There is no need to calculate, that is, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Iran and the Khanna and Iraq Two Oil Companies in Iraq are all operated by the British; almost 14 million tons of it are infused into England every year. England usually fraternizes with Romania, the world's fourth-largest oil-producing country, and most of the Romanian kerosene is also searched and purchased by England. Therefore, although England itself does not produce a drop of kerosene (?), she is like a large hoarding merchant who embraces a lot of kerosene. What's more, she relies on her abundant financial resources, a tight transportation network, and all-pervasive commerce and investment, and she does not rely on the oil of Venezuela, the world's third-largest oil-producing country, to supply her. Even other small oil-producing areas have her footprints everywhere. Now, she has the United States, which holds the world's kerosene production championship, as her shield, so there is no problem with the supply and replenishment of liquid fuel.</p>
<p>What about Germany? Comparing it with England, it is inevitable to feel ashamed! Its own production is at most 700,000 tons per year: it does not have overseas territories like British India and Burma, nor does it have large-scale oil mine investments like England in Iran and Iraq, nor does it have a large amount of cash as an advance payment for purchasing oil from overseas! Germany's foreign trade is based on the principle of "barter." This can only be exchanged for the largest amount of kerosene from Romania, but its effectiveness for other oil-producing countries will inevitably be greatly discounted. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Dried Longan: The Xinghua-Quanzhou shipping route is reported to be interrupted again, naturally leading to a temporary shortage of supply. Theoretically, the market price may increase. However, the amount of goods arriving earlier was not small, and coupled with the prolonged sluggish sales from various regions, the quoted prices have shown a decline again. Checking the retail prices in this city, due to the high initial market price, although the purchase price has now decreased, the reduction in retail price is limited. The limited sales in this city are not without reason. It is rumored that major players in the industry plan to sell large quantities at low prices, hoping that the Shanghai people will have a widespread trial, with the aim of breaking the high-profit principle.</p>

<p>Cigarette prices have been trending downward for several days because most sales channels cannot transport goods for export. Factories are distributing goods according to regulations, which are warehoused. Transactions among merchants are sluggish, making it difficult for prices to rise. For example, British Brand is 1,396 yuan, Old Knife Brand is 932 yuan, Pin Hai Brand is 867 yuan, Five Hua Brand is 674 yuan, and Little Fairy Brand is 666 yuan. The purchase prices of Hua Cheng’s Beautiful Golden Mouse brands remain stable. The prices of high-quality cigarettes are scarce and tight.

<h3 id="e77">Sweet Potatoes (Continued from the 20th) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>When did sweet potatoes spread from abroad to China? Although there is no clear record in ancient books, we can infer a general idea from the evidence cited earlier. Ji Han lived in the late third century, and Jia Sixie, who wrote the "Essential Techniques for the Welfare of the People," lived slightly later. However, his book "fully covers the methods of farming, gardening, clothing, and food." Since he recorded sweet potatoes, he must have paid attention to their cultivation methods. We can imagine that sweet potatoes had already become widespread in northern China by his time. Therefore, it would not be too far from the truth to say that they were introduced to China slightly before the third or fourth centuries.</p>
<p>The more common name for sweet potatoes in northern China is "red potatoes." Their Latin name comes from Spanish, Patatas. As I mentioned in my article on potatoes, the homeland of sweet potatoes is also South America. They traveled with Spanish merchant ships to Europe and the Philippines. The reason they were able to benefit China so greatly was because they were willing to move their precious feet from the Philippines. There is solid evidence for this, and we do not need to speculate further. Let us now look at the records in our ancient Chinese books.</p>
<p>The clearest and most detailed description of this matter can be found in He Yuanqiao's "Min Shu" from the late Ming Dynasty. He said: "Sweet potatoes were obtained by the Chinese from foreign countries during the Wanli era... They are used to support the year and benefit the poor. I once wrote an Ode to Sweet Potatoes, which can give you an idea of their importance. The Ode says: 'Crossing Min and going south, there is Luzon... In that country, red sweet potatoes cover the fields and mountains, without the need for planting. The barbarians often take them as food... The skin of the root is thin and red, and it can be eaten after peeling, or cooked. It can be eaten cooked or raw... Although the barbarians let them grow wild without care, they are stingy and do not share them with the Chinese. The Chinese cut a foot or so of their vines, and soldiers brought them over. Thus, they entered our Fujian more than ten years ago. Although the vines are withered, they can be cut, planted, and will flourish after a few days, so they can be brought along.'" Xu Wending Gong also said in "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration": "...The locals say that someone obtained this seed from overseas in recent years. People overseas also forbade it from leaving the country. This person took the vines and twisted them into a rope for drawing water, and thus was able to cross the sea and plant them, spreading them throughout Fujian and Guangdong." Furthermore, according to the Fujian Provincial Annals, Fuzhou Prefecture says: "Sweet potatoes have purple skin and taste sweeter than potatoes, and they are especially easy to propagate. This species was originally not found in the prefecture. During the famine in Wanli Jiawu (1594), the following year (1595), Grand Censor Jin Xueyan, who was in charge of Fujian, begged for seeds from foreign barbarians and taught the people to plant them as food, so the famine did not become a disaster."

<h3 id="e78">800,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Have Been Allocated: Reportedly Half Distributed to Private Colleges and Universities, with the Remainder Divided Among Public and Some Private Schools. Inquiries to Relevant Parties Indicate No Official Order Received Yet. <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Great China News Agency) According to Chongqing news, the 800,000 yuan in relief funds allocated by the Executive Yuan for teachers and staff in Shanghai has reportedly been allocated by the Ministry of Education. It is claimed that "in addition to allocating funds to teachers and staff at 22 private colleges and universities, including Datong, the remaining 400,000 yuan has been allocated to middle schools run by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau, vocational supplementary schools run by the Ministry, former Shanghai Municipal Middle Schools, Jiangsu Province middle schools relocated to Shanghai, and 69 private middle schools in Shanghai, including Xiaoguang, Lide, Shanghai Vocational Supplementary School, Shanghai Provincial Middle School, and Huguang." It is also reported that "the Ministry has completed the allocation of these relief funds and has submitted separate reports to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they be paid by emergency order directly to the various schools in Shanghai." However, when the Great China News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties in this city about this news, they said that they have not yet received an official order regarding the allocation of relief funds. Therefore, it is not known which schools will receive relief funds at all. Although this news comes from the Ministry-compiled "Educational News Weekly," it cannot be definitively stated whether it has become a final decision before an official order is received. The current problem is to promptly request the Ministry of Education to decide on the allocation and to issue the funds as soon as possible. As for schools that have not yet been settled and are in need of relief, they should continue to apply for funds.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Guangxi Education Department: Improve Teaching in Various Schools <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Education Department, noting that various schools have often neglected aspects of teaching, has issued an order to strictly observe and improve the following key points: (1) Teaching in each subject often falls short of the scheduled progress. In the future, it is essential to implement teaching strictly according to the scheduled progress. According to regulations, at the beginning of each semester, a scheduled teaching progress chart must be filled out according to the curriculum standards for each subject, one copy for the school to check and one copy to be posted in the classroom for the students of each class. If a teacher needs to take leave or resign in the middle of the semester due to unavoidable circumstances, they must find a substitute teacher in advance before being approved, and the school must promptly appoint someone to fill the position and not delay. (2) It has been clearly stipulated in the language curriculum standards that middle school students should practice writing compositions once every two weeks, for two hours each time, with short exercises taking one hour. Each practice must include individual or group criticism and use various symbols for self-revision. It has been reported that some schools only conduct five or six composition exercises per semester, or even only three or four times, and the corrections are often perfunctory. This is unacceptable and must be strictly corrected according to regulations. If the writing time is delayed due to a teacher taking temporary leave or other incidents (such as air raid alerts or temporary meetings), the writing exercise must be made up. (3) High school English teachers should pay more attention to guiding students in writing common practical documents and short selections. If they have paid little attention or not implemented this at all, they should provide more opportunities for students to practice writing in the future. (4) Students' textbooks should be purchased in advance. Schools in Baise, Tianbao, Longzhou, Nanning, Wuming and other areas can borrow textbooks directly from the Nanning Library. If textbooks cannot be purchased or borrowed, the school should print and distribute outlines and have students take notes during lectures. (5) Attention should be paid to promoting student labor service, especially guiding students to take responsibility for cleanliness in various parts of the school. School servants should not be used at will.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Zhejiang Youth Ge Zhaotong Invents an "Active Indexing Machine"; Seeks Collaborators for Trial Production <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Fenghua youth Ge Zhaotong has been studying indexing techniques for many years. Recently, based on his painstaking research, he invented an "active indexing machine" for literature and data, which can serve as a general index box for Chinese literature. To use it, simply open the machine's door, set the first character of the information to be searched for, and then use the left hand to shake the indexing machine and the right hand to press the number key. The numbers of all desired materials from Chinese literature from ancient times to the present will be recorded on a piece of paper without omission. Then, comparing the numbers recorded on the paper with the original book (which has numbers printed next to each character in a grid), you can obtain the desired information. This invention is a major contribution to Chinese academic research and can be applied to research in philosophy, ethics, sinology, textual criticism, history, geography, and other sciences. Ancient people often spent their entire lives completing only one work, which was still difficult to call complete. If the indexing machine is used, materials that ancient people had difficulty collecting in a lifetime can be obtained in a very short period of time. For example, Tang Lu Yu spent his entire life completing the "Classic of Tea." If the indexing machine were used, it could be completed in a few days. Therefore, using this machine to compile tens of millions of specialized books is not a problem. The machine can quickly find any phrase in a short period of time, knowing which book, page, and line it is on, and even which character it is. The machine is lightweight and fast. Its indexing method is different from general Chinese and foreign indexing methods. The machine does not use cards to find information. Its indexing method is divided into single characters, double characters, and long sentences. Its functions are fourfold: (1) It can be used as the main index box for libraries; (2) It can be used by scholars and experts for academic research; (3) It can be used for reading and review; (4) It can be used for compiling various index books. It is reported that Ge has prepared diagrams and instructions and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for patent rights and is seeking collaborators to engage in trial production to provide to universities, research institutes, libraries, and academic experts for research and reference. The mailing address is P.O. Box 15, No. 202, No. 160 Edward Road.</p>

<p>(Chongqing News) The Central Construction-Education Cooperation Council is jointly composed of the Ministries of Education and Economy, as well as the Ministries of Interior, Military, Finance, and Transportation, and the Aviation Commission. Local branches are jointly established by the Departments of Construction, Education, and Civil Affairs, and major local educational institutions. Its mission is to promote communication between the construction and education sectors, to coordinate the supply and demand of talents during the war, and to connect production with education to increase efficiency. The Construction-Education Councils in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces have already been established. Hunan and Shandong provinces are also preparing to establish them soon. The Construction-Education Cooperation network will soon be spread throughout the country, and cooperation between the central government and local governments, as well as cooperation among local governments, will also be promoted extensively.</p>
<p>The Council's affiliated Specialized and Technical Work Advisory Office is responsible for introducing various specialized and technical talents. Therefore, it has close ties with various national defense production and construction agencies and schools at all levels. Since its establishment, as of the end of last year, in addition to the service assignments of each year's graduates, which are centrally handled by the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, it has introduced a total of 1,046 specialized and technical personnel for employment. From January of this year to the present, it has continued to introduce another 121 people. These talents are mostly excellent mid-level technical cadres and have been well-received by all parties. However, construction agencies and vocational schools near the capital and in various provinces currently have a great need for talents in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mining and metallurgy, chemical engineering, papermaking, shipbuilding, and accounting statistics, and the compensation is very generous. In addition, middle schools in various counties in Sichuan Province need teachers in Chinese, English, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and zoology. The Northwest region also needs medical, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine talents. Letters have been sent to the office requesting their introduction. Talents in library science, music, scouting, and physical education are also in demand. It is reported that the office is currently searching extensively and has prepared P.O. Box No. 7, Qingmuguan, Chongqing, so that the above-mentioned talents can freely send letters of inquiry.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Additional Entertainment for the Hong Kong Football Season: The Burmese Chinese Team Will Visit Hong Kong; Tan Jiangbai Included; Arriving in Early April <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Burmese Chinese football team will invade Hong Kong. It is learned that they are scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong in early April. The group consists of 17 people, and their military strength is very strong. The list of players has already been received from the team, along with a detailed introduction to each player's past experience. Among the 17 warriors, "Copper Head" Tan Jiangbai, whose name is known throughout China, is also included, which attracts special attention. It is a pity that Tan's old friends have all left Hong Kong for distant campaigns. Furthermore, the main forces of both the Eastern and Star Island teams have gone to the Philippines one after another, so they cannot interact with this visiting Chinese football team from the north, which is very regrettable. The resumes of the Burmese Chinese athletes are listed below, which can serve as a pleasant distraction for Shanghai fans.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxing (Team leader, but not the "White Streak in the Waves" Chen Zhenxing who won the 100-meter freestyle championship at the 6th National Games in Shanghai and had a romance with the Mermaid) began his football career while studying at the school and is known as the "God of Football." His shooting skills are exceptionally accurate. Whenever he plays, he controls the ball and can move it left or right as he wishes. He has represented the Burmese team on many occasions and has performed in Ceylon, Calcutta, and Tripoli, earning praise.</p>
<p>Su Qingrui was the fastest center forward for the team when they played against Corinthian years ago. His heading skills are also excellent. He has represented the Burmese team extensively and represented the entire Burmese team against the Eastern and Star Island teams when they visited Burma last year. He will also play for the Burmese team this year.</p>
<p>Ji Jinyuan, nicknamed "Bull," is one of the best goalkeepers. He is exceptionally good at saving dangerous shots. He is currently a key member of the football team.</p>
<p>Wu Detang, currently the right-back, has represented the Burmese football team against the Corinthian football team. His tackling skills are very brave and constant. He is the best defender in the Burmese team and has made many contributions to the team.</p>
<p>Li Tongcheng currently plays left-back and also serves as center-back. His kicking is very strong. In Burma, he played against the visiting Eastern and Star Island football teams and is an outstanding inside-back.</p>
<p>Qiu Qichun can handle both left-center back and left-wing positions well. He has ample energy and is skilled at controlling the ball. He often wins and is a rare talent among the Burmese Chinese. He is currently the captain of the local government school football team.</p>
<p>Hong Hancheng plays center-back and is very fast. He is the best center-back in all of Burma. His shooting is powerful and he has been able to shoot from the center-back line from afar, hitting the target. His strength is evident.</p>
<p>Qiu Qirui, in the position of left-center back, runs and intercepts with bravery and skill. He has repeatedly saved the day in matches and has made significant contributions.</p>
<p>Lin Jinshui excels at left-inside back and can also fill in as center-back. He is an agile center-back talent.</p>
<p>Liang Bide, nicknamed "Ke Tudin," is a fast-moving player who currently plays right-wing. His shooting skills are also unique and praised by the audience.</p>
<p>Chen Shanfu is the youngest member of the team and currently plays right-inside forward. His running speed is unpredictable and he can avoid the solid and attack the weak, often achieving unexpected victories. He is considered a rare talent among forwards.</p>
<p>Hong Deyuan can play not only left-inside forward but also right-wing. His shooting skills are quite reliable. He once represented the Burmese team against the visiting Star Island team and played well.</p>
<p>Chen Dacheng currently plays left-wing. His passing art is exceptionally accurate. He has represented the Moulmein team in inter-city matches many times and has given impressive performances.</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai is the most outstanding inside-back talent. He represented our country at the Berlin Olympics. He is excellent at heading and is known as "Copper Head." Hong Kong fans of all ages know him. His football skills have long been renowned throughout the country and need not be elaborated upon.</p>
<p>Qingchun is a short and steady center-back. Years ago, in an inter-city match, he faced Tan Jiangbai's team and committed a foul in the penalty area, but Tan Jiangbai's team failed to capitalize and was ultimately defeated.</p>
<p>Mei Shenglai can play both left and right wing. His dribbling is so fast that defenders often cannot stop him. He has represented the Burmese team against the visiting Eastern and Star Island teams.</p>
<p>Tian Yinshun currently plays center-back and can also play forward. His use of headers is very threatening. In 1938, he was selected to represent the Burmese team against the Corinthian team. He is very brave and has made many contributions to the Burmese team.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Wartime Inventions: Vitamins and Food <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>War can indeed stimulate scientific leaps.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of this World War, the warring countries learned from the food panic that occurred during the last World War, which affected the military operations of the troops, so they exhausted their wisdom to study the invention of new foods.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Vitamin B1 bread was still impossible. Five years ago, only millionaires could afford to buy a half-cent worth. Later, due to scientific progress, 50 pounds could buy a gram. Today, only three pounds can buy an ounce (28 grams). One ounce of nutrients can supply one person for a lifetime, or 30,000 people for one day. The Edinburgh professor who invented this new food now receives an annual subsidy of one million pounds from the British government to mix it into the daily food of civilians to improve people's health.</p>
<p>In addition, the mass production of Vitamin C has also achieved astonishing results. It is said that when Italy invaded Abyssinia, Mussolini recalled Sir Castellani, a military medical expert from London, to the front line to study scurvy in soldiers due to a lack of vegetables, lemons, and fruits. After the knight arrived, he forced everyone to eat a lemon a day, which solved this serious problem.</p>
<p>Recently, Mrs. Loewenfield, a British food expert, and the Wartime Food Department also advised the public to eat wild rose hips and make them into soup, jam, etc. because they contain a large amount of Vitamin C, so they also have the effect of preventing colds.</p>
<p>The Lancet, a well-known medical journal published in London, recently published an experiment by a famous physicist proving that two mice, one fed Vitamin B1 bread and one fed whole-wheat bread, resulted in the latter being twice as heavy. The Royal Society then published a paper denying the value of Vitamin B1 and believes that the British have regressed from the diet of "milk, fruits, green vegetables, and whole-wheat bread" to "white bread, meat." A fierce debate is now unfolding.</p>
<p>A food panic is bound to occur to varying degrees during wartime, and the nutritional problems of the people are indeed worthy of attention and research. It is hoped that our country's scientists and medical scientists will pay special attention to this advanced development of scientific and serious wartime problems.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Please Use Domestic Goods to Make Spring Clothes <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Chang</p>
<p>The spring breeze has blown away the cold season, and everyone is once again taking off their winter clothes, and what should follow is the clothing for early spring. Now let's talk about the spring clothing issue:</p>
<p>For women, suitable cheongsam materials for spring can be made from domestic cotton tweed. The material should be chosen to be stiff but soft, and the colors should be medium blue, beige, coffee, etc. The style only needs to be knee-length. This is not only economical and practical, but also looks very lively.</p>
<p>For men, suitable robe materials for spring should also be made from domestic goods, because "clothes are not important for their splendor, but for their appropriateness"; especially in this year, the word "frugality" should be the premise, and the products of our own country are simple and generous, and are truly the most ideal clothing materials!</p>
<h3 id="e88">Residents and Electricity Use <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Zi</p>
<p>Recently, calls for "saving electricity" have echoed everywhere. Indeed, we cannot ignore the seriousness of this issue. Therefore, our first step in remedying the situation is, of course, to make every effort to conserve electricity. This not only reduces electricity expenses for oneself but also benefits the public and society.</p>
<p>Regarding electricity use in stores, public entertainment venues, etc., the authorities have already issued advisories and restrictions. There's no need to discuss it further here. Now, I will write down some points of attention for households, which may be of some reference.</p>
<p>(1) Limit the Wattage of Light Bulbs: For example, if you originally used a 50-watt light bulb, you can now switch to a 25-watt or 15-watt bulb. It is best to buy several light bulbs. Use brighter bulbs when working and dimmer bulbs otherwise, always ensuring sufficient light for your needs. This will not hinder your work.</p>
<p>(2) Practice Going to Bed Early: Recently, daylight saving time has been promoted, so we can practice waking up and going to bed early. During the day, it is best not to rest and use daylight to do various chores (unless impossible). Once it gets dark, turn off the lights, rest, and chat. Going to bed around nine o'clock can also be said to be following the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>(3) Use 5-watt Light Bulbs in Stairwells and Other Places: These areas only need to be visible enough, not extremely bright.</p>
<p>(4) Avoid Turning on the Radio and Seek Other Legitimate Entertainment: Such as reading newspapers, singing, or playing musical instruments.</p>
<p>In short, there are many other ways to save electricity. It is up to each household to pay attention and research, striving to save as much as possible. I hope everyone will promote this.</p>
<h3 id="e89">What a Subletter Said <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>After my article "A Message to Subletters on Isolated Island" and Yuan Mei Jun's twelve seven-character poems were published in this magazine on March 10, my old friend Jueshi came to me and said that according to this, it seemed that all subletters in Shanghai were like wolves and tigers, only seeking profit. As a subletter myself, I will now describe one or two of the despicable behaviors of a tenant, which are even worse than those of a subletter, for the readers' information. After the description, I will express my grievances, which have nowhere to be vented, in a seven-character poem, and I will consider myself a "vegetable head" (a local proverb meaning useless). This shows that not all subletters are black-hearted, but not all tenants are despicable. Now, I will transcribe his submission as follows. I hope that after reading this, both subletters and tenants can calm down, reflect on their own behavior, understand each other, and embrace the principle of "do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you." That would be fair. (The following are all Jueshi's words.) Four months before August 13, I rented a single three-story house in a lane in the French Concession for 26 yuan per month, with no courtyard in front and no back door, and I paid for water, electricity, and general taxes. In recent years, the landlord has increased the rent three times, and now the monthly rent is 41 yuan, an increase of more than 60%. The electricity bill has increased by 97%, the water bill by 30%, and the general taxes have also increased. I use two floors myself, and the third floor is rented to Mr. So-and-so for 14.5 yuan per month, including water and electricity. According to the 60% rent increase, it should now be 23 yuan, and the monthly water and electricity bill is 20 yuan. Now, there are five households in this house, so the cost should be divided into five shares, with the third floor taking two shares. Including taxes, the third floor should pay 14 yuan. (I only rent to one household on the third floor, but Mr. So-and-so sublets it to two households. Last year, people from the factory that Mr. So-and-so knew also ate in the old house. The number of people coming and going has increased tenfold compared to when it was originally rented, causing me endless trouble.) Calculating that the third floor should pay 37 yuan, Mr. So-and-so only agrees to 24.5 yuan, refuses to pay the rent, and gives no response. (He often uses 25-watt light bulbs and turns on the lights around 4:00 PM every day. When he goes out at night, the lights are not turned off even when no one is in the room. He uses water freely, leaving the tap running to wash things. I charge him 10 yuan for water and electricity, but the actual cost is probably more than that.) He has a "what can you do to me?" attitude. There are probably not a few such tenants in Shanghai, who only want to take advantage and do not care about the livelihood of the subletter. Therefore, I have written a seven-character poem and ask that it be published in the newspaper to encourage mutual understanding and awaken their conscience: "Subletters on the Huangpu River, their hearts are not all the same. If vegetable heads were all like me, subletters would be in dire straits."</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Goji berries have been on the market for a while. When they first came out, they were incredibly expensive, costing five yuan per catty. No matter how expensive they are, they're not worth that much money. My family buys two or three jiao worth every day, which is enough to stir-fry a plate. Goji berries are cooling and can clear heat. They have a slightly bitter taste. People who like them call it refined, while people who don't like them will probably shake their heads. I like goji berries, so I've eaten them several times since they came on the market. For meat dishes, you can stir-fry them with shredded pork, shrimp, or chicken slices. For vegetarian dishes, you can only stir-fry them plain, but bamboo shoot shreds are essential, and you should add more sugar to make them flavorful.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried goji berries with shredded pork, braised tofu slices, stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables, bamboo shoot salad with lettuce</p>
<p>Tuesday: Curry beef slices, braised shrimp with tofu, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts, braised shredded radish</p>
<p>Wednesday: Stir-fried cauliflower with shredded pork, deep-fried yellow croaker slices, braised vegetarian ten-treasure dish, sesame sauce malantou</p>
<p>Thursday: Tomato beef soup, pan-fried hairtail with rice wine, dried tofu with daylily, scallion broad bean puree</p>
<p>Friday: Sweet and sour fried pork ribs, pork patty stewed with white gourd, lettuce leaf tofu, pickled mustard greens with mung bean sprouts</p>
<p>Saturday: Stewed bamboo shoots with salted meat and fresh meat, braised carp, tomato cabbage, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe</p>
<p>Sunday: Duck giblet soup, steamed hairtail, stir-fried mustard greens, lettuce salad</p>

<p>In Commemoration of Mao Yi's Twenty-Second Anniversary of Death (Part 2)</p>
<p>At that time, I was flustered and disoriented, and I forgot the prescription for beef broth that I had taken with Mao on September 30. I could not even think of the English name of the beef broth company as Valentine's Meat Juice Company, let alone its local produce from Richmond, City of Wealth, Virginia, USA. Mao died of exhaustion, and both destiny and human affairs were in vain. My sin cannot be passed on. Later, on the 19th, I met Miss Peral L. Hill, a classmate of Mao Yi's at the summer school, and I never expected that the Lai Pi Pharmacy I wanted to visit was nearby, between 16th Street and Chestnut Street, not far from my hotel. The world sometimes collapses, and this hatred is endless. At this moment, my heart was broken and my soul was wounded, like a cliff flying down.</p>

<p>Western astrologers discuss human disasters and good fortune, saying that the progression of governance and chaos turns every eleven years and forty-three days. And such as earthquakes, cold weather, great wars, and great epidemics, comparing historical records and statistics, are especially clear and verifiable. This year, October 14, is exactly the twenty-second anniversary of Mao Yi's passing. On this day, there happens to be a moon and the sky is clear and fine, which is very similar to 1918. As a guest in a foreign land, this situation is not easy to obtain.</p>

<p>Mao Yi died as a guest in Nian 2nd Street in the old capital of the United States. Now, things have changed and stars have moved, and it has suddenly become a memory twenty-two years later. In a hundred years of life, more than half has passed, just like a traveler who is frightened by the cold, walking to the intersection of Twenty-Second Street, stroking his chest and mourning greatly, the world changes color for it.</p>

<p>— Qi Weide</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the Datong News Agency had a news item stating: "In Mr. Yu Qiaqing's recent public disclosure of his private rice trading accounts, there are three households: Zhao Qingji, Shenji, and Zhang Yuji. The outside world has some doubts. In fact, Zhao Qingji is Mr. Zhao Qinglan, chairman of the Rice Brokerage Association; Shenji is Shenji Rice Store on the upper floor of the Banque de l'Indochine on Beijing Road; Zhang Yuji is Mr. Zhang Yushu, manager of Tong Mao Xinji Rice Store. All of these are rice stores that resell from these households. At that time, due to space limitations in the advertisement, it was not possible to provide detailed information." What do I think? As far as I know: One month earlier, on the day before this news item, I had just written an article "Thoughts After Reading Yu's 'Announcement'" in this magazine, which included "Although the date only goes up to January 19 of this year, and the names of 'Shenji' and 'Zhao Jiji' appear under the sold items, it is inevitable that people will have doubts..." "A guilty conscience betrays itself." I felt that the Datong News Agency's "statement" was aimed at my article. I have no "relationship" with Yu and am even more "separated" from the rice industry. I am only expressing some personal views based on the facts. Moreover, my article already stated "In these difficult and trying years, it is not the time to seek merit or demerit. As long as what you do is, 'Looking back and reflecting on yourself,' truly for the welfare of society and the country, you can ignore praise or blame and strive to do your best." Therefore, it seems redundant for Yu to publish another announcement after having to leave Shanghai: Because those who "do not understand the truth" will not be satisfied with this advertisement. For example, I still have some doubts about the two points mentioned above. As for those who "already understand the truth," they naturally do not need any "petty words" like "the account books are there for inspection." For example, the Datong News Agency is willing to "bravely do what is right" by using "news" to compensate for the lack of advertising space.</p>
<p>However, it is precisely because of the Datong News Agency's "statement" that I have to add a little more to my "doubts." "Shenji" and "Zhao Qingji" are "debts with a responsible party"; but what about the accounts after January 19? On January 21, the merchant Hualun Yangxing's ship the "Glan" transported 27,990 bags; on February 5, the manager of the same company's ship the "G.G.A. Vaenne" transported 31,000 bags; on February 15, the same company's ship the "A.bert Sarrant" transported 24,500 bags; on March 16, the ship "Deda" transported 30,913 bags; on March 18, the "G.G.A. Varenne" again transported 30,500 bags; the above totals 144,903 bags. I wonder if the Datong News Agency can find the "household names" for these hundreds of thousands of bags of rice for me?</p>
<p>In short, Yu's "announcement" clearly states that "Due to his long-term involvement in the shipping industry, the difficulty of transporting ships can be barely eliminated," and "He has been doing business in Shanghai for sixty years." In business, because he has his own "iron barges" and can take some "advantage" in "shipping costs," it is not too much. However, precisely because "Qiaqing is old," he "suffers this blame for seeking perfection." Others who are "getting old" should read this "announcement" and be wary. As for those who are far from "old," they simply hope that rice prices will fall. How can rice prices fall? In addition to the efforts of the authorities and people from all walks of life, newspapers and news agencies should also bear the responsibility of public opinion.</p>

<p>— Yang</p>
<p>"Sold it yet?"</p>
<p>The door of the small room opened with a "creak," and Mrs. Wang hurriedly asked Mr. Wang, who ran in, covered in sweat.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang did not answer, just shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang looked at Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. Wang looked at Mr. Wang. Finally, Mr. Wang broke the silence.</p>
<p>"These奸商 (treacherous merchants), they deserve to be killed! According to the market, each box should be 40 yuan, but I'm selling them cheap!</p>
<p>That's all I have to say, judge me as you will. I gave them 35, they didn't want it, heck, they wanted to cut it down to 30 yuan a box. I ran around in a big circle, it was all like this. I, I bought them for 22 yuan a box, and there's also the transportation fee, sigh!"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang looked at the ten boxes of soap piled under the bed, and his heart was filled with endless sorrow. Mr. Wang is a teacher at ×× Middle School. With his ability, he actually teaches at three middle schools in this isolated island where it is difficult to find work. But, no matter what, he always has to withdraw some from Mrs. Wang's savings every month to supplement expenses.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Wang saw that the market was rising again, and he had a clever idea. He persuaded Mrs. Wang to withdraw all the funds to earn "big money." Mrs. Wang was reluctant at first, but in the end, she was persuaded by Mr. Wang and withdrew 350 yuan. Mr. Wang then happily went to buy ten boxes of soap, thinking that he could make a high profit from this and no longer have to be a teacher.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the soap rose in price. Every morning, Mr. Wang would always open the newspaper to read the economic news, and he was always happy, talking at length about his great plan.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang was also very happy, because according to Mr. Wang, 350 had turned into at least 400!</p>
<p>But, it is said that the market is about to fall. And, there is another big reason, Mr. Wang's rice jar is already empty. Therefore, Mr. Wang decided to sell five boxes first.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wang ran around all day; today, Mr. Wang ran around again.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say a box should be over 40, how come no one wants it for 35?"</p>
<p>"This, this is the treachery of the merchants!"</p>
<p>"I, I said it was better to be content, ill-gotten gains don't enrich the poor!"</p>
<p>"Hmph! Now you're saying sarcastic things, didn't you want to get rich?" Mr. Wang got angry.</p>
<p>"I'm not selling! I'm not selling! I won't sell until it's 40 yuan a box!"</p>
<p>This made Mr. Wang even angrier, "Tomorrow, what about tomorrow's rice?"</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he suddenly stood up and walked out.</p>
<p>"What do you plan to do?"</p>
<p>"What plan is there? Go sell it!" Mr. Wang seemed to have become a prisoner on the battlefield, defeated and discouraged.</p>
<p>"Don't leave five boxes to wait for the price to rise?"</p>
<p>"Rise? Bah!"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang went out and quickly returned.</p>
<p>"Loss of 20 yuan! No! Make the treacherous merchants earn dozens of yuan, sigh!"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said dejectedly, his hopes completely dashed!</p>
<p>From this great rise, Mr. Wang no longer thought about getting rich.</p>

<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>An upcoming masterpiece by a certain great writer, soon to be published, has a section describing the extravagance of a wealthy family's daughter, saying: "She went to the ×× company and ordered a dozen pairs of identical high-heeled shoes, regardless of color, at a price of 49 yuan and 9 jiao per pair..." Below the price, the great writer added in large parentheses: "(This is based on the Shanghai market price in April of the 30th year of the Republic of China.)" It is said that Shanghai's prices are soaring, without stopping. Perhaps in a year or two, or even a few months, the prices will be very different, losing the original meaning of the text.</p>
<p>Writers across the country followed suit, and on average, in every 100,000 words of text, this type of annotation took up 13,741 words. Publishers shook their heads, as these annotations were still counted as the main text - 1 yuan in legal tender per 1,000 words, the same price as 1 yuan per catty of green vegetables at that time.</p>

<p>(5) The Boundary Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>Xiang Qi not only told him everything about how she had been deceived by Yuan Baofan, but also said very clearly that she was willing to be his friend forever.</p>
<p>In the life history of Qiu Haitang (Begonia), this day was truly the happiest day! At lunchtime, his appetite had increased threefold compared to usual; but if someone asked him which dish was the best, or what Zhao Si said to him while he was eating, he would definitely not be able to answer.</p>
<p>"If only we had met a year earlier!" He was washing his face in the room, and he couldn't help but think of Luo Xiangqi again, and sighed to himself.</p>
<p>He saw that it was still early, and although he didn't know where Liangmi Street, which Xiangqi had mentioned, was, he thought that it wouldn't be too difficult to find it in two hours. So he decided to go out alone first, without mentioning a word to Zhao Si, Rongkui and the others, so as not to leave any trace in the future.</p>

<p>— Li Hengzuo</p>
<p>The Chinese part of Tianjin was not very big to begin with. Although he didn't take a rickshaw, relying only on his two legs to walk, after walking for more than three quarters of an hour, he finally found this remote little road behind Hubu Street. Number 34 was an old, low-rise house, with at most two courtyards, but the courtyard between the main gate and the second gate was quite wide; on the east and west sides, there were large locust trees, with their branches twisted and turning, forming a canopy like two broken umbrellas with the paper removed. The ground was very clean, and the doors, windows, and walls were painted very newly. The last time they were renovated was probably no more than three months ago!</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang hesitated for a long time at the entrance to the second gate, not daring to go in. First, he was afraid that it was too early, and Xiangqi herself had not yet arrived; second, he thought that a guest who had arrived here should at least call out, but how should he call out? Although he had learned Xiangqi's name from the reply letter, how could he directly and bluntly call out "Is Xiangqi at home?" when they were only new friends who had met twice?</p>
<p>Helplessly, he had to cough loudly twice, just like he did on stage. (62)</p>
