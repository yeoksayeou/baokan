<p>社評</p>
<h3>叙利亞衝突的剖視</h3>
<p>協約軍此次攻入叙利亞，從英法傳統關係上看，不獨是法國的大不幸，即對於英國，也是一件很痛心的事。但從整個國際形勢來說，英國的搶先動作，却粉碎了德義的陰謀，消弭了牠一個嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>英，法以前有著長期合作的歷史，這次歐戰裏，又是同盟國，現在却變成兵戎相見的敵人。這無疑要影響到兩方面的上氣與民心，而給予共同敵人的德義以挑撥資料。我們祇安一讀近兩天英，法兩方的聲明。自由法國運動首領特戈爾等人的通告，以及德，義的表示，就可以瞭然。當去年法國瓦解時，最觸目的現象，首先是失敗情緒的瀰漫，其後竟充滿了反英的論調，德，義利用機會，其後竟散佈英國完全自私自利，以法國爲犧牲品，而自己則保存實力，隨時可與德，義妥協的謠言。邱吉爾等人曾力圖挽回彼時的頹勢，予法國以英，法命運完全合併的保證；但在法國片面遭受德軍衝擊及義軍夾攻的情勢下，牠終於放棄了抵抗，在走上屈辱途程時，滿懷都是對於英國的忿恨。於是以反英健將著稱的拉佛爾，法蘭亭，達蘭等人，就乘時而起，他們懷抱着的幻想，以爲經過反英途徑，走上親德，義的路，憑藉海外殖民地及剩留的艦隊最好能走進德。義集團；而最低限度，也企圖加入一新秩序」，獲得與西班牙等國相同的地位，以達到所謂保持法蘭西帝國完整的目的。可是與他們對立的自由法國運動—特戈爾派，却號召所有法國海外屬地的澈底團結，與英國合作，奮鬥到底，從最後勝利裏求得法蘭西民族的自救。兩派比較起來，是非所在，情勢顯然。自由法國運動所以一直未取得本國大部份擁護，而英國也始終愼重着，不以軍事行動幫助他們在法國屬地建立根據的眞正原因，或是爲了法國這個反英情緒的作梗。至拉佛爾等人則因爲對美國有所顧忌，及自身的聲名狼藉，所以還不能使法國與英國正面衝突。在這樣情勢之下，英國非至萬不得已，絕不至對法國屬地用兵。情勢的推演，今昔異殊，英國當前祇有更加强調澈底擊敗德。義的決心，使法國人完全了解英國勝利就是法國勝利的眞意。</p>
<p>如果我們再把視錢由英。法擴大到整個國際上去，那末，這一次叙利亞事件，却不過僅是一個必然的後果，而德。義的併力東下方是根本原因，法國維希當局的屈服於德。義，以叙利亞作德。義伸入中東的跳板，却是促欣了牠突然爆發的主要因素。英國如果眞如前天維希政府的聲明所說，對於叙利亞有所謂領十野心的話，則英國以前大可趁巴爾幹大戰；近東形勢緊張時，一舉而由巴力斯坦等地，突然佔領叙利亞，而不必等到克里特失守，東地中海及中東一帶形勢十分危急的今天。英國如果在巴爾幹沒有變色前佔領叙利亞，法國叙利亞當局，在彼時恐怕祗有接受與英國合作的一條路，並且可以影響土耳其對於整個巴爾幹大戰的態皮，也說不定。更進一步探討，英國現在如果無所行動，那末，一等德，義勢力慢慢潛進叙利亞，達到相富數量的時候，這一帶也許要爆發另一個閃電戰，向英國所有在中東·非洲·及紅海的勢力，大舉錘擊，所以最近兩天的英。美方面輿論，大體上，一致贊同及頌揚英國這一次的堅毅行動。路透社的倫敦電訉說：如果有批評這次行動的話，那末，唯一的批評，祗有指摘牠的出現太遲。</p>
<p>當然，叙利亞事件到底怎樣結束，對於今後整個國際形勢的演變，將發生異常重大的作用。這時推斷起來。牠的可能前進，似乎不外三種：第一，特戈爾，賈德魯等人指揮的自由法軍，取得了利亞大多數法軍的合作，一齊集中到自由運動的旗幟下來，首先終結英未能間的戰事：以後的叙利亞戰爭，祇在英。法與德，義之間展開。第二，英軍迅速擊敗法軍，等德，義軍衝進到叙利亞的時候，再發生英國與德，義的大戰。第三，假定維希政府因此與英國正面衝突，和德，義駢肩作戰，那末，不獨叙利亞的大戰，要因之延長，而且英國也就新添了一個敵人，法國本身的存在與自由前途必更多磨折，是毫無疑義的。</p>

<p>但今昔最重要的異點，還在德國空軍的力量。德國佔據挪威北部與法國南部各根據地之後，更如虎添翼。德方開頭僅用飛機，從事偵察和散佈磁性水雪，隨後造成長距離戰鬥機，齊斯都婁號和果里爾號兩種，往返一次能跨越半個大西洋，於是他們用飛機兼充破壞工作。英國縱有愛爾蘭的大好根地據，但缺乏長距離戰鬥機，也是枉然。</p>
<p>法國的淪陷亦有一種重大的影響。即德國攫得法國一都份軍艦後，發現其中裝有英國攻擊潛水艇的秘密武器，如潛艇測器等。德方把它研究之後，就運用新的戰術以爲對付。</p>
<p>上次歐戰時，英國得自由利用地中海爲接濟路綫。這次自義利參戰以來，英國已不能抄襲近路。自去年六月起，英國僅一度集合巨大護航隊，通過地中海，結果遭德義兩國俯衝式轟炸機的猛襲，輕巡洋艦蘇桑浦敦號被擊沈，航空母艦光榮號受重創。經此威脅的結果，英國商船不僅須繞道南菲洲開普港，且須派遺多數兵艦前林地中海，大西洋的防衛力量，又因而减弱。德國趁此機會，派遺剽襲艦，以神出鬼沒的手段，破壞英國商船。</p>
<p>又上次歐戰時，潛水艇的威脅是惟一可怕的東西，現在呢，可怕的東西，層出不窮。據英國最近宣佈　船失事原因：被潛艇擊沈者，佔百分之三十九，被飛機擊沈者佔百分之二十三，觸水雷沈沒者百分之二十二，被戰鬥艦擊沈者及原因不明者各佔白分之八。且自德國利用長距離飛機轟炸以來，在飛機炸彈下損失的商船，爲數當更可觀。</p>
<p>英國目下的護航計劃，由海軍部逐日製就，倫敦脫拉法爾加廣塲附近海軍部灰色古厦的地圖室裹，每天早晨有一羣軍官和職員，圍着巨大的地圖桌，在地圖上揷拔顏色別針，每針代表一船，依其顏色，辨出護航船或獨立船，在駛出或在駛回途中。</p>
<p>地圖室人員把在海中的船隻一一用別針上標出準確地點後，把地圖移交另一室，讓護航專家們悉心推考。他們根據德國潛艇剽擊艦和飛機活動地點的情報，決定最安全的航路。午後，這張地圖和預擬的航綫，送交海軍參謀部核奪。最後用無綫電傳達西部某港大四洋英國海軍艦隊總司令諾貝爾上將的司令部。</p>
<p>諾貝爾上將和他的屬下，即用無綫電向海中各船發出命令。如係護航隊，則知照各護航艦，通常係驅逐艦兩艘，隨時揷入中型巡洋艦一艘，負責保護商船二十至六十艘。</p>
<p>英國商船損失的嚴重情形，上自邱吉爾首相，下至庶民，無不焦慮。英國年內怎樣獲得商船三四百萬噸，彌補現在的損失率，以便支持到明年，正是一個難題。單靠英國本身的造船率，萬萬不濟。今年英國的造船成績，充其量不過一百萬噸，而各造船廠遭轟炸後，或當减至七十五寓噸左右。</p>
<p>肉是英國主要進口貨（註四），開戰以來，因來源不暢，牛羊猪肉每星期的購買限額，已自兩先令兩便士，陸續减至一先令，的可購一磅。合金等金屬品的匱乏亦未可輕視，陸軍戰車的裝配，已不得不用較脆的鋼鐵，代替合金。</p>
<p>英國社會一般人都希望美國來給他們援手。英國派在華盛頓的代表團，希望美國以商船五六百噸相助。邱吉爾首相也說英國作戰前途，端賴美國依照一九一八年情形，大量造船。但提高造船率，非短時間所能辦到，今年美國最高造船率，至多不過一百十萬噸（註五）。</p>
<p>當然，美國還有別種援英方法，羅斯福總統且已將其中一部份準備就緒，或已付諸實施。總統所扣留的德義和丹麥的商船二十九萬噸，（即等於英國輪船三星期的損失率），頗有移交英國的可能。至於美國船駛往紅海，民治國援助法所規定五萬萬美元建造新船數百艘，及使英國商船獲得在美國各港修理的便利等項，雖屬善策，但都需時日，不能立即生效。美國今年眞正可採取的有效行動，只有實行派艦護航，或派遺海軍飛機幫助護航隊担任偵察工作。</p>
<p>（註一）這次歐戰爆發時，各國所有商船噸位如次：英國二一、二一五、二六一噸，美國一四、六一二、九九一噸，日本五、六二九、八四五噸，挪威四、八三四、九〇二噸，德國四、四九二、七〇八噸，美國三、四四八、四五三噸，荷蘭二、九七二、八七一噸，法國二、九五二、九七五噸，希臘一、七八〇、六六六噸，瑞典一、五八一、九一九噸，蘇聯一、三一五、七六六噸，丹麥一、一七六、一七三噸。</p>
<p>（註二）自一九四〇年六月至十一月，英國商船損失最重，平均每星期六萬三千噸，其中允以九月十四日至二十日之一星期爲最多，達二十萬零五千七百八十一噸。</p>
<p>（註三）這次歐戰爆發時，各國海軍噸位如次：英國一、一六一、〇〇〇噸，美國一、〇七二、〇〇〇噸，日本八四一、〇〇〇噸，法國五〇一，〇〇〇噸，義國四一七、〇〇〇噸，蘇聯二四〇、〇〇〇噸，德國一七八、〇〇〇噸，西班牙一三三、〇〇〇噸，阿根廷一〇一、〇〇〇噸，瑞典八五、〇〇〇噸，智利七〇、〇〇〇噸，荷蘭六〇、〇〇〇噸，巴西五四、〇〇〇噸。</p>
<p>（註四）英國平時每年進口貨物五千寓噸，由商船九千艘及海員十五萬九千人擔任運輸。輸入主要物品數量如下：小麥五百萬噸，牛油四十七萬噸，乳酪十四萬五千噸，牛肉六十六萬噸，羊肉三十六萬噸，猪肉三十七萬五千噸，橋子五十二萬噸，蘋果三十四萬五千噸，香蕉二千一百萬噸。</p>
<p>（註五）美國政府及商家現有航海輪船一千二百三十三艘，共的七、二七九、一九六噸，尙有四百五十艘在建造中。美國造船速率以一九二〇年爲最高，全年所造幾達三百萬噸。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗銷不弱　雙馬始漲終跌</h3>
<p>紗市始昂繼軟、但實際交易、賡續不斷、二十支雙馬向海外運輸、時有所聞、所以有一部份心思看升、不過金子幫及證券幫大都將標金作圭臬、忽進忽出、使人殊難捉摸、因之變化迅速也、查香港幫買去各紗的有二千六百九十包之鉅、就此而論、市面當然望高、但有一批投機的人們、以爲太平洋問題、尙未解決、且高峰未能穿出四百六十元外、賣意復濃、謠風一起、乃重見下降矣、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百五十八元、低價爲一千四百三十四元、午後氣勢不及上日之熱閙、不過市狀軟中帶硬、初做一千四百四十一元、漲至一千四百四十六元、回至一千四百三十九元、最後價爲一千四百四十一。二元、今晨有棉紗二千件運港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日熱烈之氣續進、首盤價爲一千四百五十八元、此盤一開、盈利者多數向出、所以遂呈緊弛之局面、少頃小至一千四百四十九元、在此五十元之間、有一度掙扎、旋聞標金回鬆、謠風又起、謂美國商船被擊、人心頓虛、一跌即至一千四百三十六元、但現紗銷路不弱、低盤進者頗不乏人、又回好至一千四百四十二元、收盤價爲一千四百三十九元、查半日間成交統計九千七百九十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港二、六九〇同行七、一〇〇統計九、七九〇</p>

<h3>棉市向榮　巴西棉廠號均有定成</h3>
<p>現棉情况、殊爲俏利、因美棉日升、人心堅固、所以細絨棉有漲無跌也、不過粗絨遠不及細絨之挺秀、廠號兩誠方做開雖不若前昨之盛、然亦可謂相當熱鬧、粽觀斯景方興未艾之勢也、昨一日問共計成交七百四十件、又一千五百包、價跌一二元、</p>

<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、良以紗市逐步趨漲、同時國際情勢展開有利因之人心煥發、購意熱烈、廠方如申新。永安、同業如大昌。順大等皆有大批巴西棉成交、至於因美印棉一再高漲、各方心思一致看高、是則棉市前途、日見繁榮、當可預下焉、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因外商買進而漲勢猛烈、但續後又因一部分獲利了結稍跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日高漲九至十六磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、亦因棉商不斷補進亞姆拉而漲、收盤價格漲二至七羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况、因美棉堅昂而看漲一羅比半、</p>
<h3>疋頭　怡和粗布獨堅</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市勢平穏、各布開價殊少變動、惟因實銷多寡關係、一部份價格微有波動、結果怡和粗布因廠盤堅持、南洋幫續有採辦、而上漲二角半、粗斜因貨底漸厚、跌二角半至五角、怡和綸昌漂染布一部份漲五角、本街成交各布三百餘件、粵港幫辦色布粗細布斜紋二百餘件、南洋幫辦粗布色布漂布等三百餘件、今有疋頭一千二百三十件運港、</p>
<p>東布　晨市隨紗下落、午盤龍頭細布棧單降至四十四元五角、四君子嗶嘰一元四角四分半、後市以雙馬回升、人心穩定、龍頭細布回高至四十四兀七角、嗶嘰一元四角四分八七五收市、</p>
<h3>糖市　期糖間有了結　現貨再度回降</h3>
<p>昨期糖六月十日已屆、聞菜中人一部份已照公會議則辦理交割、但另一方面仍在僵持中、查此次市價之慘跌、照事實而論、亦屬市勢使然、似非空方壓低所致、蓋觀於近日之現貨劃盤、便可瞭然、多方似未使過持高論、以背公議、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧五月份到貨、初跌五角、爲九十三元、旋又降九角、以九十二元一角成交、前後降去一元四角、餘乏續市、可見供過於求、一時不易挽高云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球漸趨穩定　—暗盤便宜十元—</h3>
<p>煤球行情、自月初加高廠盤二十元、各界對此、頗多憤慨、近日來已稍形回降、漸趨穏定、各廠掛牌、雖仍爲三百十六元、同業暗盤、絞市便宜十元、綫單爲三百零六元、送到另加車力、本街門莊、亦紊亂非常、最高每担十六元六角、照定價爲廉、</p>
<h3>棉（三）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>初無踏車椎弓之製，率用手剖去子，綫弦竹弧，置案間振掉成劑，厥功甚艱。國初時，有一嫗名黃道婆者，自崖州來，乃敎以做製桿彈紡織之具，至於錯紗配色，綜綫絮花，各有其法。以故織成被褥帶帨，其上折枝，團鳳，棋局，字樣，粲然若寫！人既受敎，競相作爲，轉貨他郡，家既就殷，未幾嫗沒，莫不感恩酒泣而共奠之，又爲之祠，歲時享之。』所以元朝在中國南部各省，特置「木棉提舉司」以司稅收；明太祖初立國時，也下令：『民間有田五畝至十畝者，栽柔桑「木棉」各半畝。』可見國家對於木棉的重視，也可見從此以後木棉普及到我國各處，不必如謝枋得所咏：「嘉樹種木棉，天何厚八閩。』的爲南方所專利了。（未完）</p>

<h3>日本侵華結果　財政陷極度窘境　國內不景氣公債無法消化　祇得向海外各地僑民設法</h3>
<p>日方自發動侵華戰事以來、迄今將及四載、耗費財力物力人力甚鉅、不特毫無收穫、且欲圖迅即結束戰事、又束手乏術、以致甚難久持、而財政困難、實爲最嚴重問題、故其侵華軍費、大部不得不倚賴發行公債、</p>
<p>本年預算不敷甚鉅</p>
<p>本年度因預算不敷甚鉅、竟擬發行公債十五萬萬元之鉅、以資彌補、惟以國內人民受不景氣之影響、對公債消化力薄弱、致日勸業銀行所承銷之第二十二次儲蓄公債、及第八次救國公債成績甚劣、日本大藏省遂決定設法向僑居海外各地之日本人民張羅、</p>
<p>派員來滬竭力推銷</p>
<p>故該行受大藏省國貯獎勵局之囑託、乃派遺該行行員小崎淸彥。佃豐誠。二人來滬、會同大藏省華中財務官事務所及興亞院華中連絡部、設法勸告現在旅居上海及華中各地之日僑及日商購該二項債券、此次發行總額爲一萬萬元、規定華中各地日僑須承購一百萬元、定六月十四日起至七月十日止、在各日商銀行發行、</p>
<h3>上海郵權　又被侵蝕　郵局辦淪陷區航匯　槪由日機航空帶運</h3>
<p>據上海郵政管理局長通諭稱、查華中及華南淪陷區內各局之航空匯票、應自即日起恢復開發、其匯票核對據、應交所謂中華航空株式會社所辦各航空綫之飛機運遞、該項核對據、如不能全程由航空帶運、應在中途儘量交由飛機運遞、以期迅速、至航空資費、除照納普通匯費及補水費外、每一航空匯票、不論滙額多少、概收國幣二角五分、其他手續、悉按航空匯票章程辦理、局長乍配林、</p>
<p>匯費甚高據大通社記者探悉、上海與華中華南通遞航空匯兌地點、計指定爲安慶·杭州·漢口·廣州·南京·等五處、其匯費甚高、計上海開漢口之航空匯兌、每元除照納普通匯費一分外、另加補水費五分、杭州每元匯費同上、安慶每元除普通匯費一分外、另加補水費二分、廣州每元除普通匯費一分外、另加補水費一分、南　除普通匯費半分外、另加補水費半分、</p>
<p>郵權侵損查上海與國內各自由區通匯航空匯兌者、如重慶昆明、所收匯費、均祇每元一厘（卽千分之一）、每張航空寄費、祗一角五分、（華中華南需二角五分）、是均由於日辦航空寄費之提高、且淪陷區之舉辦航空匯兌、尙屬上海戰後之創舉、故關心上海郵務者、惴惴於郵權之日益侵損也、</p>

<p>滬東楊樹浦爲工廠林立之區、昨晨六時半、芷在女工紛紛上廠工作之時、行至匯山路附近、突有日人開放獵槍、當塲有女工受傷倒地、受傷人姓名（一）徐銀妹、十六歲、傷背部、（二）徐銀杜、十八歲、傷腿膝、（三）徐林珍、廿九歲、傷胸臂、（四）厲邵氏、四十歲、傷足部及胸臂、後經救護車送眉山路三十四號滬東醫院醫治、其中以厲邵氏傷勢較重、住院醫治、其餘三名、經包紮後、旋即出院、</p>

<h3>法大使戈思默　昨由平飛抵滬　僅有數日勾留卽須他往　駕輕就熟更動之說作罷</h3>
<p>法國駐華大使戈思默、於昨日下午四時許、由北平乘飛機抵滬、在大塲降落、然後乘汽車赴法租界公館馬路二號法國總領事署、法租界外灘自愛多亞路起至公館馬路一帶、自下午三時起、即開始戒備、除電單得行駛外、其餘車輛行人、一律禁止通過、在法國航務公司前、駐有法國海陸軍各一隊、越南兵一隊及軍樂一隊、至五時、戈氏偕隨員分乘汽車三輛、馳抵該地、由法國駐滬海陸軍長官陪同檢閱一過、時高奏法國國歌、士兵舉槍致敬、移時、戈氏即乘原車離去、聞戈氏在滬、僅有數日勾留、即須他往、但所赴何地、尙未宣佈、最近法國駐華大使、本有易人說、現據可靠消息、法政府對於此議、業已作罷、以戈氏履任後、於兩國間折衝、感情素洽、故法政府願留任戈氏、以資駕輕就熟、戈氏年近五旬、昨日抵滬時、隨從甚簡、戴灰色呢帽、衣灰色西服、雖長途勞頓、但精神　鑠、至外傳戈氏昨日係乘法國航務公司大達南輸抵滬之說、完全不確、該公司職員、昨日對記者、亦已正式吾認矣、</p>
<h3>比大使將來滬</h3>
<p>比駐華大使紀佑穆、前以與中樞各要人睽隔已久、於三月間特由平夾滬、轉港飛渝、作邦交上之拜會、藉資增厚兩國睦誼、渝地多大使親友、往返酬酢、幾無虛日、故駐　迄今、不覺已兩月有餘、茲據使館消息、大使因離平日久、重要館務、須待親自處埋、已定於本月底離渝飛港來滬、聞大使在滬、稍事休息數日、即將返平、</p>
<h3>法租界平米到　六萬餘包　昨市謠傳米輪被扣　米蠹又圖作祟未果</h3>
<p>據法國航務公司消息、該公司之大達南輪、業於昨午十二時抵埠、現停泊浦東共昌碼頭卸貨、聞該輪載有四貢一二號混合碎米四萬零一百二十二包、二號貢米二萬四千九百八十包、聞是項米糧、會經法租界當局之核准、由米糧進口委員會訂購者、將以最低價格、在本市出售、</p>
<p>人心鎭定抬價不成</p>
<p>昨日米市塲內、因達孚洋行承裝一千噸小紋米之某輪、在仰光被扣之消息傳出後、一般米蠹、以爲又藉此可以高抬售價、於是開市後、即喊高價、無如人心鎭定、乏人問津、以致一般米蠢、無不垂頭喪氣、不得不抑價出籠、故昨日市價、仍與前日相仿、無甚下落、</p>
<p>永昌米號恢復發售</p>
<p>日前大通路二百七十八號永昌米號、因有攙雜嫌疑、經工部局會前祥茂洋行派員調查屬實、取消其發售平米權利、經該米號一再請求、未蒙允許、加以目下全市居民紛購平價小絞米、以致各色食米、如無人問津。該號店主趙俊蓀、以難以維持營業、特親至平米辦機關懇求、轉向工部局申請、局方爲顧全其營業起見、始允其請、以觀　效、</p>
<h3>延平路小工　昨已復工</h3>
<p>工部局工務處之延平路貯料所小工、上星期五日因工頭被歇、相率罷工、要求該工頭復予僱用、昨推出代表、於昨（十日）晨十時、與工務處官昌開始談判、以謀解決糾紛、談判結束後、小工即告復工、聞該工頭因不從調遺、致被辭歇、未必再予僱用、外傳工務處其他貯料所小工亦將響應罷工之說、未獲證實、同時延平路貯料工作、現仍陷停頓中、</p>
<h3>工部局今日討論　增加職員薪給　詳細內容昨日未能探悉　傅將增加總薪給額什四</h3>
<p>工部局今日（十日日）舉行例會時、將對該局全體雇員之再加薪給事、有所決定、加薪建議之詳細內容、未能探悉、而工部局官員對此、拒小發何言論、僅證實加薪問題、將於今日決定、</p>
<p>考慮加薪已歷數週</p>
<p>查　局考慮全體雇員加薪事、已歷數週、可靠方面會傳加薪建議、若經局方核准、則所加的計基本薪給與生活津貼之什四、目下工部局雇員所得生活津貼總數、的一倍半於基本薪給、聞局方已考慮將此津貼數逐漸加至兩倍、</p>
<p>或將分爲數種等級</p>
<p>若干人士、則信局方今日或將決定僅加津貼約什二、若現况未見好轉、則嗣後續加什二至什三、且局方今日決議加薪、諒將分成數級、庶更受生活費用高昂的跋重影響之雇員、所加津貼益多、同時、向來可靠方面頃稱、法租界公　局雇員或將從下月初起、一律加薪、惟法常局對此、拒不披露消息、</p>
<p>各方重視增加數額</p>
<p>字林報云、工部局人事委員會所提增加該屬雇員生活津貼之建議、料將於工部局董事會明日（十一日）午後集會時、捉出討論、查工部局雇員現得之生活津貼、爲基木薪金的百分之一百五十、聞人事委員會於詳細研究中西雇員之生活狀况後所建議之增加數、不足百分之一百八十、各方對此建議、頗予重視、蓋本市其他各業雇員之酬報、現多隨工部局雇員之收入而定也、若干人士則對工部局雇員薪給或津貼之增加、有所懷疑、</p>
<p>勢必影響一般物價</p>
<p>據消息靈通人士聲稱、工部局宣佈雇員加薪後、本市食糧與必需品勢必隨之漲價、而食糧等價格所漲之數、恒超出工部局雇員薪給或津貼所增之數、生活費用高昂、首受其苦者厥爲許多商家之小職員、以其收入所增之比例、不若工部局雇員之多也、</p>
<h3>上海醫院設備　移借應用　昨已無人前往搬取　法捕房已派員查點</h3>
<p>法租界祁齊路一七二號上海醫院之醫藥設備、自被人搬運一空後昨據該院某醫師稱、該院之一切必要設備、經主任海靜格向各方呼籲移借後、已告粗備、故院中治療工作、得照常進行、昨已無人前往搬運、惟法捕房昨日仍派有越捕二名、駐守該院、下午三時、盧家灣捕房　派員至該院會晤海靜格主任、詳細調查被搬走各物之種類、</p>
<h3>浙省公路客票加價</h3>
<p>據交通界息、浙省公路運輸公司、以邇來油類及各種材料價格飛漲、各項成本均隨之激增、茲爲維持交通並資挹注起見、酌量各路段客票提高、以每公哩國幣二角計算、如由金華至麗水、全程一一九公哩、則票價爲二十三元八角、至龍泉二十七元四角、至松陽十三元四角、聞已呈報備案、定本月十六日起實行、</p>
<h3>四總統輪被徵　僅屬調遣性質　如果停駛準備派輪代航　遠東貨運公司決予維持</h3>
<p>美國航務委員會徵用美國總統輪公司之柯立芝。克利扶倫。塔虎脫·批亞士總統·等四輪、刻公司已予證實、但以公司方面、原有共他未經調用之倫隻、加入補充、對於航運絕未受絲毫影響、惟此後或將不載乘客、專運貨物、然此種措置、僅有可能性、尙木有肯定消息、</p>
<p>四輪被徵舊輪代航</p>
<p>據輪公司消息、關於　立芝等四輪被徵爲陸軍部輔助艦後、何日實行、猶未據確訊、但四輪之被徵、於此間太平洋與遠東之航行、以公司原有擱置未用之老傑克遜號與美特總統輪（譯音）等儘可改派行駛、作爲替代、故航行不受影響</p>
<p>名義受徵仍駛遠東</p>
<p>至於柯立芝塔虎脫批亞士克利扶總統等四輪、名義上雖已被　、但嗣後仍將行駛遠東、或竟來滬、蓋被徵後之行動、僅不屬於公司、而歸美陸軍部調度而已、據公司消息、公司方面有行駛大西洋之其他總統輪三艘、早經撥歸美陸軍部應用、其中二艘、包括前曾來上海撤僑之蒙脫卡洛等二艘、</p>
<p>克利扶輪明日抵滬</p>
<p>克利扶總統輪爲被徵之一、該輪凖於明日上午七時由馬尼刺香港回程返滬、輪泊十二·十三號浮筒、此來除戰有大批郵件外、並有鉅額之貨物載來、在滬繫泊十六小時、即於十三日上午十一時解纜經神戶·檀香山·舊金山·返美、接客小輪末班十三日上午九時半由新關碼頭開往、此去是吾將被徵用、公司未予證實、柯立芝總統輪爲該公司最大郵船、載重二萬二千餘噸、現正滯馬尼刺、的本月十八日回程來滬、留泊一宵、即行返美、並有亞當總統輪加入世界班航行、定於七月二十四日處女航抵達上海云、</p>
<h3>密豐廠勞資又衝突　工方有人受傷</h3>
<p>鄱陽路四百號密豐（蜜蜂商標）絨綫廠工潮自上月問開始後、僵持迄今、已將　月、勞資雙方、態度强硬、罷工期內、續有不幸事件發生、本月四日晨、勞方再度向資方交涉、無奈意見懸殊、雙方竟起衝突、結果工方有多人被擊受傷、嗣經工部局政治部派員調解、雙方互見　讓、刻勞方推派代表六人、於日內與資方進行談判、共覓解決途徑、</p>

<h3>貼水消滅反得升水　匯劃制度成功　法幣存戶多調匯劃應用　擔保品確實流通額愈廣</h3>
<p>上海銀錢同業公會自實行匯劃新制度後、各行莊提供擔保品、向銀行聯合準備委員會領用新滙劃、規定新匯劃總額為國幣五千萬元、並洋商銀行公會暨中中交農等行、合組匯劃準備檢查委員會、按月公開檢查、以昭大信、是項有確實擔保之新匯劃籌碼、上海中外止當商人樂於收受、今已普遍流通上海市塲、</p>
<p>嚴格取締　匯劃貼水</p>
<p>匯劃票據不得付現及轉購外滙、祇准在上海同業劃賬、於是投機之錢兌商店竟利用滙劃之不得　現、創造滙劃貼水之新例、雖經財政部命令取締、終因上海背景關係特殊、為衆目注視之嚴重問題、並認為欲防制資金逃避、必須取締匯劃貼水、例如二十八年七月間每千元最高貼水為二百八　元、二十九年五月二日貼水　為二百二十元、而銀行聯合準備委員會受中國交三銀行之委託、對滙劃貼水曾予設法平準、旋因各種關係、於二十八年七月一日起停止進行、</p>
<p>新制收效　貼水消滅</p>
<p>自新匯劃制度改善、有確實擔保之匯劃籌碼、普遍流通上海市塲、而中外持票對是項新制度、均已逐漸有相當認識、滙劃票據漸與現鈔劃頭同樣行使、滙劃貼水逐步下落、無形消滅而至平調、與　每千元需貼水　百八十元、不啻霄壤之別、而以前購藏外滙與外幣者、今則售出轉為　幣、同時銀行聯合準備會對劃頭往來戶、除减息外、並規定限額、惟滙劃流通額愈　、</p>
<p>擔保確實　反得升水</p>
<p>新匯劃有確實之擔保品、如匯劃準備檢查會之檢查報吿、今年四底止、已審定之領用　業匯劃額為國幣　百　百九十九萬　千　百元、而各行莊繳存同業匯劃擔保品評價總額為國幣四千六十七萬七千八百九十三元、內計貨物十五萬一千二百元、有價證券六百九十八萬一千一百八十元、房地產三千九百五十四萬五千五百十三元、並已定六月二十日舉行第二十三次檢查、　滙劃票　信用之堅日甚、今竟　成匯劃　水之新現象、</p>
<h3>司閽印捕　手槍被刧</h3>
<p>戈登路一二四三弄之司閽印捕（一四二號）、於昨晚九時四十分在弄口値崗之際、突有歹徒五名、闖至該印捕身前、持槍恫嚇、將印捕挾至弄內、將其身畔所佩之公務手槍（槍號二二一）及子彈六顆、一併刦去、匪等分頭逃逸無踪、</p>
<h3>氣候不正　疾病流行　霉季將始</h3>
<p>入夏後天時即呈炎熱、　久晴不雨、氣候亢旱乾燥、不　影響農作、抑且有害居民健康、近來傷寒疹症肺癆等傳染病症極形猖獗、天花猩紅熱等也有發現、幸尚無霍亂病症、總計上週公共租界內死亡華人一〇五九名、外僑一六名、法租界內計華人二七五名、外僑三名、共計華人一三三四名、外僑一九名、總數共達一三五三名之多、昨傍晚起旋雨飄揚、風勢勁削、据向徐家滙天文臺探悉、昨日之陣雨、係霉季開始信號、長江流域、天氣轉陰、遠至華北平津一帶、天色亦呈陰暈、</p>
<h3>統戊電政兩債　昨晨抽籖</h3>
<p>民國二十五年統一公債戊種債票第十一次還本、暨民國二十四年電政公債第二十三次還本、於昨日上海十時舉行抽籖、到國債基金管理委員會第一特區法院·上海銀錢業同業公會·中央中國交通三銀行等代表裴雲卿胡　安嚴大有等二十餘人、</p>

<h3>郵局刦案贓款　尚未交還郵局　儲滙局六嫌疑人質訊　家屬探視日方均拒絕</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局鉅刦案破獲後、日方對起出之贓款、尚未交還郵局點收、用意何在、漸引起間之焦慮、大通社記者、茲探錄各情於后、</p>
<p>款未交還</p>
<p>據上海郵政管理局可靠方面消息、該局鉅刦案、雖經捕房與日憲兵隊合作、迅速破案、並經將原贓二百萬元（並非二百五十萬）如數起出、惟該款截止昨晚止、並未交還郵局點收、</p>
<p>六人未釋</p>
<p>惟日方曾保證該款　着、　相信即可由日方交還、現在辦理上項交涉者、為郵局總巡員岡田、並非金指謹一郎、因金指謹一郎在請病假中也、至解送　款之儲滙局職員王勗初等六人、亦未釋放、</p>
<p>拒絕探視</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉該六人覊押於虹口永安銀公司舊址內、家屬幾度托局方送衣服與本人、均為日方拒絕、且表示即可釋放、惟實際仍在質訊中、故在郵局推測、贓款之未交還、當與該六人之質訊、有連帶關係、</p>
<h3>煤球乏人問津　市價一蹶不振</h3>
<p>煤球市價、自被各　型機製煤球　非法抬高後、與論譁然、外界指斥頗烈、一致主張徵辦、兩租界當局亦曾派員分赴各機製煤球厰調查製造煤球成本、昨　各煤業公團消息、煤球去路刻愈益滯呆、市塲現貨充斥、乏人過問、煤　無法繼續活躍、市况疲不能振、厰盤每噸雖仍　持三百十六元原盤、而「黑市」價格頗猛降未已、每噸已由三百十六元跌至二百九十元、並持貨人猶擬抑價求脫、棧單雖稍有去路、而現貨顯已無人問津、煤斤有一萬噸刻已在滬運　中、　於本月十五日左右抵達此間、該一萬噸煤斤、大半屬於煤屑、故嗣後製造煤球、非特原料無虞匱乏、日成本亦顯然减輕、</p>
<h3>特捐決計開徵　娛樂塲漲價</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局以行政經費支絀、曾於上月下旬、分別通令各戲院影戲院等娛樂　所、定於六月份起、加征娛樂特捐百分之十、當時各戲院影戲院、因物價高漲後、開支浩繁、維持亦殊不易、設或一旦實行、則戲院本身為維持血本起見、亦惟出諸增加票價之一途、則間接不啻增加觀衆負担、故曾聯名呈請維持原狀、惟結果仍未獲得當局之許可、益之各戲院之低級員役、近又要求增加米貼、致戲院本身負坦增加、不得已各平戲院下今日起、聯合漲價、昨天蟾·更新·大舞臺、共舞臺·聯合通吿云、敝臺等奉工部局諭、收娛樂捐一成、又因百物昂貴、薪工激增、致按原有票價營業、實有入不敷出、難以維持、敝臺等爰定本月十一日起、一律新訂票價、俾能稍　挹注、事非得已、還希各界垂鍳、（查其加價標準、平均漲二成左右、）</p>
<p>影　　將分集</p>
<p>至於各影戲院、亦奉當局同樣命令、要求維持原狀未果、今見　　　　　　　、為維持本身利益起見、亦定日內舉行會議、商討增加票價辦法、惟影戲院票價第一輪與第三四輪相差殊鉅、故屆時亦決分等漲價、漲價後之娛樂塲所營業、將不無遭受若干影響也</p>

<h3>畫家馬孟容不朽</h3>
<p>大新畫廳自今日起、展覽永嘉五馬書畫金石五天，其主要者為孟容先生之遺作。孟容與公愚為　枝、機雲二難，以書畫金石詩文蜚聲藝苑。孟容不幸早世、余失一良友，今忽忽十年矣，黃壚之慟其曷能已。顧孟容之精神長存天壤間，彌久而其名彌彰，可以徵信也。孟容夙擅書畫詩文，於畫尤其具天才，家學淵源旣深，收藏又富，猶必日涉園林游覽山水，觀察宇宙之眞象。每見奇禽異卉，輙目擬指畫，倚管沈思，至會心處，便眉飛色舞。偶遇沿　叫　息擔道旁　，舉凡鱗蔬菜之之類，靡　凝神注視，求其姿態之眞，圖諸日記簿中而後去。其嗜畫若命，工力獨到，不僅憑藉天才涉覽圖譜已也。故其畫於古今畫法，無不融會貫通，而能自闢畦徑。神明於法理之中，而筆超乎跡象之外，名体無所不精，花鳥草蟲魚蟹尤神妙獨絕。「異魚圖」「異卉圖」「異禽圖」「蟹不如一蟹」諸幅，久碑人口。孟容不但善畫，且更善敎，任各學府國畫敎授有年。學者一經指導，便覺精采異觀。出其門者多名家。孟容死，蔡元培院長嘆曰：「喪一國畫大家損失尚小，喪一國畫敎育家損失甚大也」，洵哉斯言。今大新畫廳為紀念此偉大之藝術家逝世十週起見，特舉行遺作展覽，附以公愚，碧篁，士鈐，靜娟之近作，用　良深。夫中國之藝術，貴乎能古，亦貴乎能創，然此談何容易。非寢饋於古深者，雖欲創而不能也，否則亦野狐襌而已。孟容古有甚深之根柢，而又能推陳出新，自闢境界，不與他人同面目，非天人兼到曷克臻此，其足不朽奚疑哉。大凡人情多貪易畏難，以仿效他人為便利。故鄧石如出，天下皆鄧。何子貞出，無人不何。今之貌襲者多矣，然欲求不朽，則非自有創獲不可也。（郎靜山）</p>

<h3>怎樣研究英文（二）</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>可是、總結一句、不問目標遠近大小、或是在校、或是自修、要想把英文研究得相當的可以應用、總得有一個方法、蠻幹硬幹、也求始不能達到一定的目的、可是自己就要吃虧了、一個不小心、也許就要弄得灰心、甚至失敗、</p>
<p>研究英文究竟有什麼方式呢、有、很多、好像江湖的口語、「戲法人人會變、各有巧妙不同」、獲得過一點成績的人、都各有各的心得、也各人有各人的方法、筆者在這硏究的途徑上、兜過一些圈子、也走過了不少的回頭路、現在不揣淺陋、很願借本刋的一角、把自己在讀與敎上、所得的一些小小經騐、略略貢獻一點、算是拋磚引玉的意思、</p>
<p>本文打算把硏究英文的三個條件、和續·寫·說·譯·的幾植小門徑、檢討一下、</p>
<p>三個條件</p>
<p>一·筆者認爲研究英文似乎應當先樹一個目標、有了目標、就看準了牠勇往直前、這麽一來、就可以免除多繞灣子、換句話說、就可以認淸了一條不支不蔓的直路、筆直的前進、直路也可說是「捷徑」、譬如說、有的人只求將來在英文上應付得過去、有的人把牠當作探求科學的橋樑、有的預備走上文學的途徑、有的耍拿牠來應用到職業上、有的僅是看作一種學科上的修養、這一切等等、都是不同的標的、所以在硏究上也似乎應當走不同的路、要把牠用作科學橋樑的、似乎不必去追求沙七比亞、</p>
<p>二·有了目標、認淸了一條直路之後、我們得把這一條路測量一下、劃分出幾個段落來、第一個段落當然是屬於英文的基本訓練、筆者認爲能够切實的念完了讀本第三冊、和初級英文範、或同等程度的課本、也就算是基本訓練告了段落、然後看我們的目標是什麼、再把路徑確定一下、再定幾個段落、一段一段做去、這與我們的校課並無衝突、並且有很大的補助、爲什麽要劃分段落呢、這是科學化的辦法、一方面可以提振精神、一方面要避免貪多或問斷的弊病、這每一段落都是有相當的時限的、試想、我們要是在規定的時限內、達到了規定的段落、精神上該是如何的欣慰、至於規定目標的事、只看所擇的職業、就可決定、劃分路程段落的問題、就得同敎員或先進們多多硏究一下、時限的長短、最好有點伸縮、</p>
<p>三·英文的訓練方式、大概可以分爲兩種、我國比較用得多的可以稱爲間接法、則是「課本指導」方式、另一種即直接法、雖也有課本、但主要的還是活材訓練、這兩個方式本來各有千秋、但筆者個人的憑見、認爲直接法活潑有趣、而效率極高、因學生在學的時候、已經是在實騐應用了、</p>

<h3>娘兒們的「病」</h3>
<p>— 淇水</p>
<p>巍峨的七層大厦，三樓第三號的房間，是留德博士大醫師診所。掛號十塊錢。</p>
<p>診所是挺精緻的，裏面坐了四位「痛苦」的太太。</p>
<p>花太太是有名交際花，當下起立，不消幾句，就統認識了：一位是金公館的叫姨太太，那個坐得好好的是錢買辦的二太太，至於另外一個胖胖的，她是張經理的愛妾。</p>
<p>畢　花太太交際得多了，先開口：</p>
<p>「金太太，你害的什麼「病」呀？」</p>
<p>「我嗎？」余太太嘆口氣：唉「……時常有些「胃氣痛」。」</p>
<p>「噢，幾時起頭的？」金太太搖搖頭：「多年了……老爺終天總要我陪客，一會吃，一會吃，老是把肚子裝飽…，現在有時飯米屑一粒嚥不下。」接着又嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>花太太呵口氣：「怪病……嗯，買辦太太有啥不舒服？」，錢太太摸着兩條手臂；</p>
<p>「怪討厭的，兩條手臂酸痛得很，動動要發作。」</p>
<p>「那末，如何來的？」金太太趕緊問。</p>
<p>「喏，大概多受了凉：我們每晚要打好幾十圈牌，打天亮的回數多，搭子老是有許多，就是好幾位「先生」買辦呀，經理呀，主仟呀，行長……」</p>
<p>這時經理太太猛把高跟鞋一蹬：</p>
<p>「斷命的，我的「病」算最糟了……討債毛病，銅鈿看掉不少，連「進帳」也沒有了……」</p>
<p>三位太太不禁都把臉湊近攏。</p>
<p>「你們是不知道的！我的張先生每月總得給我三四千塊錢，專是買花粉用的，其他當然不算在內……自然，我不用買這許多花粉，可是空放着也太可惜，得「利用利用」才好……」</p>
<p>聽張太太說得入情入理的，三個頭點點：</p>
<p>「是啊，是啊。」經理太太可起勁了：</p>
<p>「於是我想着了：一邊囤點貨色，什麼日用品之類；邊呢，跑跑「檯子」；哈，不是誇口，我賭大小已是幾年了啊……再，回力塲，跑狗塲……也不能忘掉啊……唉，這樣，你們想，不「煩心」，「用腦」嗎？……」</p>
<p>三位太太齊聲：「煩心，煩心……」</p>
<p>張太太突然用手把沙發靠手一拍：「毛病就來啦，以後常時耍頭昏眼花昏沉沉的……」</p>
<p>「那，補品多吃些……」</p>
<p>張太太眉頭一皺：「唷，話起補品，眞弗要提了，銀耳，人參，燕窩，鹿茸…「西」些的：維他命，魚肝油，製劑，酵素，什麼什麼的，那個不吃到……」</p>
<p>「花太太，那你呢？」不巧得很</p>
<p>碰着花交際也是一聲嘆氣：「唉，太太們都是有「福」的，怎比得我個「苦命」……」</p>
<p>三位太太三聲奇怪：「花太太，這怎麼說呀？」</p>
<p>花太太連連嘆息：「我每個晚上，不知要「跳」多少的「票子」，十晚有力晚通宵……你們小知道的，不「紅」了，夜夜「湯團」，「紅」了，好啦，「毛病」就來啦，現在我的腿總是酸酸痛痛的，不肯好，可是每晚總得打起「精神」，跳，跳……」</p>
<p>三位太太驀然都沉默了。突然金太太尖聲尖氣的：「花太太，你怎會「紅」的呀？」</p>
<p>花交際猛把嘴一呶，拋轉頭，狠命的沙發上頓一頓；「去問你們的「先生」們好啦！」</p>
<p>門開了。</p>
<p>護士老鼠似的探進頭來：「×醫師來了。」</p>
<h3>短七</h3>
<p>— 王沛</p>
<p>你若是愛生命，你就應愛惜光陰，因爲光陰是製造生命的原素。</p>
<p>不要以爲自己有聰叫的天才，一個目空一切的聰明者，不比一個事事注意的愚者來得有用。</p>
<p>忿怒是有理由的，但都不能有充分的理由。</p>
<h3>護目第一</h3>
<p>— 錢心良作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的莊稼人</p>
<p>並且其中有幾個都是莊裏出名的無賴，借到一次就想第二次，有了第二次又想第三次，簡直不鬧到借錢給他的人顚倒向他們告饒決不肯罷休，吳老爹子一着急，這才再三向秋海棠勸了幾次，但半年不到，五百多塊錢已付之流水了。</p>
<p>「只要以後不再借給他們，這五六百塊錢父算得什麼呢？」他聽了他叔父的勸告之後，最初心裏還毫不介意，反淡淡地這樣微笑着說</p>
<p>但一年過後，他也不由不開始憂愁起來了</p>
<p>第一，事實給他證明，只要以後不再借給他們這一句話是絕對行不通的，至少對於那幾個無賴；有一次他們就險些跟他在村口上打起來。第二，他看到梅寶一天一天的長大起來，面龐那樣的秀麗，資質又是那樣的聰慧，即使是改穿了鄉下孩子的服裝，但跟他哥哥的兒女站在一起，還是有着極顯著的不同，使秋海棠深深地感覺到梅實是應該另有她的前途的；在這樣的窮鄉僻壤裏，一定會埋沒她的一生，爲了他愛女的幸福，他決定要找一個適當的時機，另外遷到別處去，好好地把她造就起來。這樣他就漸漸覺得自己所有的積蓄的不夠了。</p>
<p>玉崑和趙四從北京簪他帶回來的除掉兩個定期存摺——六千元——以外，現款原也有兩千多元；但爲了搬家，爲了置辦東西，爲了結交親友，爲了這一年多來因家用不够而一再貼補，爲了…箱底裏藏的現款，已經快不到一千了。</p>
<p>於是他開始憂愁了：</p>
<p>「老　，你在這裏也氣悶得很，再說我這個人已經是完全癈了，你跟着我一定也不會再有什麼好日子過。」（一二九）</p>
<h3>「媒」「瞞」「霉」</h3>
<p>— 顧應</p>
<p>好像聽人說過，做「媒」是一件「便宜事」；人家百年好合，添兒增孫，自己拿媒人錢，吃媒人酒，這眞樂得方便的做媒。</p>
<p>爲了如此，錢老太也高典地做媒了。</p>
<p>可是做媒是有「訣」的，那就是個「瞞」字。當然錢老太是「過來」人，也脫不了這，她懂得「十媒九瞞」，因此居然瞞男家，瞞女家的成就了錢老太的媒。</p>
<p>錢老太滿肚子高興，無處舒暢，因之逢人便說，見人就道的自揚「媒術高明」，其實大半高興在吃媒人酒，拿媒人錢</p>
<p>她是始終以爲：婚姻憑父母之命媒妁之言的，才是「正道」，吾則總瞧不上眼，說成什麼樣子。</p>
<p>不過就在要結婚的前數星期，錢老太的「霉」也就來了。</p>
<p>女家的千金是個獨養女，自然是顆「掌上珠」，本來預備招個如意婿的，就給錢老太幾個轉灣，打消了金龜念頭，但「條件」也就苛刻了，要這樣要那樣的，黃白物拿過去，不是嫌輕，便是式樣老；鈔票呢，又要多少多少，這可不由使錢老太皺眉了。</p>
<p>男家新人是自已姪兒，自然他家一切內藏都熟悉，碰巧，他的老媽，也是個腦袋上生樹根的，一跳起身來說不要了，說養了兒子不怕沒媳婦，我又不是在覓寶！哈，錢老太一聽，呆住半饗！哈個，兩親家如此疙瘩，怕要「瞞」不成了。但錢老太這「面子」下不過去，且媒人要吃十八頓」，就是說走男家奔女家，而廢時生事的十次八次，也不好算「難媒一。</p>
<p>可是以後錢老太竟奔「忙」得發怨言了，怨　做媒像在「倒霉」。</p>
<p>原來小「夫婦間要求錢老太介紹，互相見見，目的看看電影，走走公園。呵，這錢老太認爲荒唐極了，她想起自己出「閣」時，關於道，半個宇也不敢提及。於是根據這，正經地敎訓了他，她一頓…二不料他，她竟提出「抗議」，說什麼已滿「法定年齡」，婚姻可「自主」了，這叫錢老太摸不着頭腦，她猜來從前和現在也不過這樣……，接着，錢老太愈不懂了，他，她竟敢直截爽快的解除婚的，認爲未得本人同意，概作無效……否則不惜請律師，登報紙……，錢老太怎不叫氣昏，想不到小輩也會忤自己的媒，還說什麼法律解決，那眞大「逆」了。</p>
<p>同時，女家「打聽」得那個新人榦着沒「出息」事，一月十「手」也不到……那怎麼可！女兒最好嫁個「出客」「氣概」，坐汽車，住洋房，娘姨大姐成羣的才不枉，所以二十幾歲女兒還不嫁，也就是爲這一點點。女兒靑春不妨擱誤，但「一世嫁不到好男人」，豈不「反而吃虧」！</p>
<p>於是女的爸媽拖住了錢老太，說你做媒如何可瞞！錢老太暗忖不好了，剛討了沒趣，又要「賴婚，啥個體統？</p>
<p>但錢老太還想瞞下去，想男家去走走吧，所謂拔拔苗頭，不料沒開口，男方第一句話也是賴婚。原來他們也打聽得那位千金曾去過「內地」，且外邊交際廣闊，男朋友不知有多少，所以這門親無論如何是不配的，趕叫錢老太退回茶禮聘金。錢老太一想，這話的確倒還有相當理由，那新娘原來「私奔一過，且常是不在家的，這媒還是小瞞妥當………。</p>
<p>唉，錢老太「忙了半年多，爲了媒，說慌，欺瞞……却只落得個「霉」。</p>
<h3>爸爸吝嗇嗎？</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>姐姐說：爸爸眞吝嗇。</p>
<p>國爲，他要爸爸買頭髪油。爸爸說：現在百物高漲，米要百把塊錢一石呢！那有閒鈿來買頭油，用水潤髪吧！</p>
<p>哥哥也說：爸爸眞吝嗇。</p>
<p>因爲，他要爸爸買西裝。爸爸又說：現在物價高漲，米要百把塊錢一石呢！那有閒鈿做西裝。長衫穿穿吧！</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>醫生對姐姐說：「你身體很衰弱，最好多服補品，允其要常服淸魚阡油。」</p>
<p>爸爸便到藥用裹買了一加侖，他說：「道油耍十塊錢一磅呢！爲了你們健康，我是願意買的，你們儘吃，吃完再好買的。」</p>
<p>哥哥校裏發起寒衣捐，要爸爸出錢，爸爸立刻認捐，他說「我們應當愛護大家。要有力的出力，有錢的出錢才對呢！」</p>
<p>爸爸吝嗇嗎？我問。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>國產新片觀後紀</h3>
<p>— 莤蒂</p>
<p>這裏我很忠誠而且是很坦白地爲游藝界讀者介紹我最近看過的四張新片，那便是：滬光的「美人計」，新光的「斷腸花」，金城的「鐵窗紅淚」，以及國聯的「江南小俠」。</p>
<p>凡是看過「三國志」的，大概會記起劉備招親，弄假成眞這一段故事來吧，「美人計」，即是根據了這事蹟編寫成的。王次龍編導，王元龍主演，二王碰在一起，他們本是昆仲關係，此片眞可謂「兄弟作」了。關於演員的支配，是：王元龍的趙雲，路明的尚香郡主，王乃東的劉備，李景波的孫權等，這一個陣容，除胡蝶換了路明外，差不多就是「孔雀東南飛」的原班人馬。王元龍的演技，可以評爲：「英俊有餘，表情不足，」一舉一動，似乎都嫌「牽强」，而不能流於「自然」。王乃東穿上了古裝，怪頭怪腦，扮相難看，而且還不能脫去時裝時的派頭。李景波演得還不差，他本是個劇人，自然，舞臺經騐，是相當豐富的。路明的演技，有驚人發展，可惜戲太少，不容易討好觀衆。</p>
<p>「斷腸花」是個悲劇，據編導人王引說，是他本年的最得意的一個傑作了。劇情很苦，的確能賺人眼淚。是影圈裏與周璇同享盛名的「典型小丫頭」，這部戲裏山她來擔任小婢，當然適當之至，此星自「西施」後，與觀衆隔離頗久，本片演來處處流露眞情，實在難能可貴，這該是「王引的指導有方」了。劉瓊飾熱血靑年，一身是膽，演技似乎比以前進步得多。其他如王獻齋，韓蘭根，殷秀岑等，亦都稱職。</p>
<p>「鐵窗紅淚」也是個悲劇。因着編劇上倒叙處很多，所以在演出時，就多了不少阻礙。陳燕燕飾小鳳，角色是相配的，可惜對於悲意這一點，演得還不夠「動人肺腑」。梅熹的表情，有新的進步。至於洪警鈴與章志直的一段戲，吳永剛以現實性的題材挿入，而拿活潑的手法處理，寫二個流氓，臨死時　徘徊着「黃金之夢」，駡現在的時代，駡得好，駡此刻的蛀蟲，駡得更好。</p>
<p>「江南小俠」是一張武俠影片，其中神奇的畫面，倒也不少，甚麼五行神劍，甚麼騰雲駕霧，甚麼飛沙走石。故事是叙述崑崙派大戰崆峒派，全無意義。陳娟娟的舞劍表演，還可以看看。娟娟頗可演戲，然而讓她來擔任「小俠」，演那種「無聊」的故事，旣不是適合其個性，又未能發展其天才，這一點，是值得我們熱心於推進國產電影的人們加以注意的。</p>
<h3>銀花繽紛錄</h3>

<h3>顧蘭君產後新作</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>顧蘭君自從主演「貂蟬」奠定她在銀壇的基礎，三年以來，地位從沒有動搖，這，固然可以歸納在「時勢造央雄」中的定論裹，她是一個勇敢的大膽的具有毅力的新女性，道從與李英毅然結合的一段人生過程中，可以獲到充分的證實。她與李央結合後，已經在上月十二日產下一個孩子，至今，恰巧一個月了。</p>
<p>在道一個月中，她是恢復產前康健的體格，因此，就要預備本片工作的重新開始，除了她與李英自費攝製「同命鴛鴦」外，就在國聯主演岳楓的新作「美人島」了。</p>
<p>「美人島」充滿南洋羣島的熱帶風格，在她正配合性格的，男主角亦已內定由劉瓊擔任了。</p>

<h3>梨園人物小誌</h3>
<p>— 南腔北調人作傳張予我璋製图</p>
<p>（十二）姜妙香</p>
<p>論目今梨園小生人才，除已死者外，其健在者羣　程繼仙；但繼仙因年邁退隱，不常顯身於紅觀毺，程以外，當推姜妙香之資望爲最老。姜本習靑衣，倒嗓後始改工小生，雉尾生，扇子生，窮生，無一不工。梅蘭芳重其才，每組班，必的妙香爲配。若紅樓古裝戲，咸由妙杳配寶玉。能戲如「羣央會」周瑜，「十三妹」安驥，「飛虎山」李存孝，「岳家莊」之岳雲，尤擅勝塲。「會玉堂春」審時之讀狀，更爲人所稱道，蓋今之演會審者，類多略去「讀狀」矣。近年因年事日高，扮相巳無昔日之淸秀文雅，舉止亦不若當年之飄灑風流矣。兼擅丹靑，以畫牡丹爲最佳，畫件上輒署「慧波」，慧波蓋妙香之字也。有一女，適譚富英。前歲娶馮蕙林之女馮金芙爲繼室，蕙林乃姜之業師，金芙爲北平戲劇學校高材生，師兄妹結婚，一時傳爲佳話。共人饒有書卷氣，似儒者而不類伶工也。（下次星期六刋張君秋）</p>

<p>二人且行且談，一路下了威鳳山，行至城鬥，城門口有兵丁在那裹檢查進去的人。有個小卒認得許靖的，立刻讓一人進城去。二人跑到王永泰家裏，王永泰已在那裏盼望了。相見畢，同至書室裹坐定。王永泰遂告訴他們說，何姬淫亂不德，罪不容赦，已逼伊自縊而死。那桑一淸也被自己吩附家丁活埋在後園土中，了結這一段孽緣。且說道：「這是他們自己作孽，並不能怪我殘忍了。我也不能因信佛之故而饒赦他們的。况且這裏早晚難免有一塲惡戰，我總不能不破戒咧。」說罷，長嘆一聲。許靖因向周將軍昨夜是否無恙。王永泰道：「昨夜我已得家人回報，知道衙門捉住兩個剌客，其中的一個已傷重而當塲身死。今晨老夫便解送那刺客到衙門中去，慰問周將軍，且將昨宵舍間擒住刺客之事，的略禀告。周將軍聽說，也很驚訝，又渴欲一見柳君，吩咐老夫等到柳君進城時，務要引往一見，所以老夫請二位在舍間用了午飯，當由老夫引導柳君和賢姪同往周將軍那裹拜謁。」柳隱英道：「小子僻處山野，一晌未曾進見王公大人，所以周將軍那邊不敢晋謁，還請老英雄善爲我辭吧。」王永泰道：「柳君不要客氣。像你這表人才，落落大方，談吐雋雅，可謂一時俊彥，和我這位許賢姪，無分軒輊。周將軍再三叮囑我必要介紹足下往見的，無論如何，我不能認柳君回去，被周將軍笑我無能，留一個人也留不住的。况且周將軍好賢若渴，待人恭謹。見了柳君一定歡喜。柳君　不前去，那是小肯實老夫之臉了。」許靖也在旁相勸。柳隱央不得已勉尤一見。於是王永泰設席款請二人，預備了不少佳肴。許靖很是高興，和王永泰對飲數杯。柳隱英却喝了半杯，淺嘗即止，一定不肯多喝。</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Armored Units Invade Syria in Three Routes: Left Wing Crosses Litani River and Closes in on Beirut; Right Wing Advances Along Highway Towards Damascus</h3>
<p>Syrian Border: Infantry, Supported by Armored Vehicles, Invade Syria in Three Routes. One Force Takes the Route Through Ras Naqoura, Advancing Along the Coast. Another Force Crosses the Tell El-Qadi and Ascends the Fertile Basin of Lake Huleh. The Third Force, Mainly Composed of Indian and Free French Troops, Crosses the Dan River East of Kiryat Shmona and Heads Straight for Damascus. Simultaneously, Cavalry Units Enter Syria to Patrol and Hinder Resistance from Outposts. French Vehicles in the Metulla Area, Mostly Manned by Colonial Soldiers, Offer Slight Resistance. Both Sides Engage in Artillery Battles. Australian Troops are Clearing Machine Gun Nests in the Mountains. The Quneitra Fort is Currently Exchanging Fire with Central Forces. The Initial Target in the Area is Two Bridges Near Malkiyah, as These Bridges Lead to Beirut. Opposition Elements in the Towns of Malkiyah and Kfar Yuval are Also Offering Slight Resistance. There is No Sign of Enemy Aircraft Activity. (Reuters Correspondent with the Troops, 10th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Middle East Military Headquarters Announced Last Night That the Advance into Syria is Progressing. Allied Forces Advancing Along the Coast Crossed Tyre on Monday Morning, Then the Litani River. Allied Forces on the Left Wing Advancing Inland Have Crossed Itri, Sheikh Miskin, and Reached the Quneitra Line. Both Itri and Sheikh Miskin are on the Deraa (Syria's Border with Jordan) to Damascus Railway. Itri is Approximately 20 Miles North of Deraa. Sheikh Miskin is 50 Miles South of Damascus. Quneitra is Approximately 40 Miles Northwest of Itri and Southwest of Damascus. The Vichy News Agency Reported That Allied Forces are Entering Syria in Three Routes: Two Routes Dividing to Take Deraa and Safed Separately, then Converging to Take Damascus. The Third Route Follows the Coastal Highway to Take Beirut. This Route Has Advanced to the Litani River North of Tyre. The Agency Stated That After French Resistance Against British and De Gaulle's Troops, the British Have a Clear Advantage, Especially with Their Armored Equipment. The Vichy Side Pointed Out the Weakness of the French Forces Defending Syria and That France Cannot Actually Supply the Army with Weapons, Ammunition, Food, and Fuel. Free French Radio Station Reported That the People in the Occupied Areas of Syria are Enthusiastically Welcoming the Allied Forces and That the French Troops in These Areas are Preparing to Join the British and Free French in Combat. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Vichy: News Received Here Last Night Stated That British Imperial Forces and the "Free French Forces" Advanced Yesterday in a Sweeping Posture. After a Verbal Battle with French Vehicles and Soldiers, They Were Only 30 Miles from Damascus. French Artillery, Aided by Aircraft, "Defended the Position." It Was Also Claimed That They Inflicted Heavy Damage on the Allied Invaders. According to the Announcement, Two French Submarines, Aided by Warplanes, Attacked British Warships Concentrated Off Tyre Attempting to Disembark Troops, Dispersing the British Ships. The Air War in Syria Was Fierce. British Aircraft Heavily Bombed Damascus, Baalbek, Rayak, and Aleppo. The Announcement Also Stated That French High Commissioner in Syria, General Dentz, Has Sealed Off the Border Near Turkey. It Also Claimed That "British Forces and the 'Free French Forces' That Crossed the Syrian Front on Sunday Intensified Their Attacks on Sunday Afternoon and Monday Morning. From the Trablus Mountains to the Foothills of Mount Hermon, the British Advanced with Powerful Armored Units. Our Rearguard, with the Aid of Artillery and Air Power, Fiercely Resisted Every Inch of Ground. In the Area South of Lebanon's Coast, British Cavalry and Armored Units Were Repelled South of the Litani River. From the Litani River to Iklil El-Mish, and the Quneitra Area, Fierce Battles are Still Ongoing on the Front Line. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Allied Forces in Syria are Continuing to Advance Towards Damascus and Beirut. According to a Statement Released by British Headquarters in Cairo, the Military Operations are Progressing Satisfactorily. The General Impression is That the Arab People are Responding Favorably to the Arrival of the Allied Forces. After Crossing the Litani River, Allied Forces Continued to Move Along the Coast and Occupied Tyre, Less Than 40 Miles from Beirut. The Troops Entering Tyre were Mainly Australian. Other Troops are Currently Advancing Along the Two Highways from Palestine and Transjordan to Damascus. According to a Military Spokesperson in Jerusalem, the Troops Only Encountered Scattered Resistance Along the Way and Suffered Very Few Casualties. Allied Forces on All Routes Have British Air Cover. The Vanguard Forces Consist of Infantry, Artillery, and Light Tank Units, Carrying Bren Guns and Anti-Aircraft Guns. It is Reported That the Australian Troops Crossed the Border After 6:00 AM. At That Time, They Passed Through More Than a Dozen Villages and Only Encountered Slight Resistance in Two Places. In a Village About 7 Miles from Tyre, the Road Was Bombed by French Colonial Troops, Delaying the Army's Advance. In Another Village, Dozens of French Colonial Cavalry Opened Fire on Australian Tanks. The Australian Troops Immediately Returned Fire with Machine Guns and Entered the Village Within Minutes. Arab Residents and Children in the Village Cheered Loudly to Welcome Them. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Weak French Resistance; Many Defect to Free French Forces</h3>
<p>London: According to Information Received Here, Mechanized British, Free French, Australian, and Indian Forces Have Marched North into Syria and are Continuing to Advance. A Military Spokesperson in Cairo Revealed That Since Sunday Afternoon, Allied Forces Have Advanced an Average of 35 to 40 Miles, Encountering Only Scattered Resistance from the French. British Casualties are Insignificant. It is Reported That a Large Number of French Officers and Soldiers Have Defected to the Advancing Free French and British Imperial Forces. Some French Troops Have Also Ceased Fighting. It is Generally Believed That the Litani River is a Major Obstacle. The Allied Forces Have Now Crossed This River, Which is Very Satisfying. Regarding the Political Aspect of the French Reaction, There is Little Detailed Information Here. However, Based on the Current Situation, French Resistance Appears to Be Very Weak. Allied Forces Departing from Deraa and Passing Through the Djebel Druze Region are Also Progressing Satisfactorily. The Djebel Druze Region is Rocky and Rugged. Transport Vehicles Must Travel Along Highways. However, Those in the Region Who Have Been Heavily Bound are Believed to Lean Towards the British. The Highways Passing Through Deraa and Quneitra Converge 40 to 45 Miles Outside Damascus (Syria's Most Important Center). Sheikh Miskin is Between These Two Locations. Tyre is 30 to 35 Miles from Beirut. The Litani River is 10 Miles to the North. There is No Sign of Any German Action in Syria. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares for Swift Action to Forestall Syrian War</h3>
<p>Sweden: A Dispatch from the "Democracy Newspaper" in Berlin States That the Berlin Government Has Not Yet Issued Any Opinion on the Syrian Matter. However, Political and Foreign Circles are Extremely Concerned About This Matter. The Authorities Stated That Dealing with Rebellion and the Enemy is France's Own Affair. However, General Dentz May Seek Help from Germany. The Government Still Denies the Presence of German Troops in Syria. Those in Political Circles Say That Vichy Implies That Germany Must Act Swiftly. The Dispatch Also States That Berlin Cannot Stop the Rumors Spreading Abroad That Germans Are Entering Syria. However, Germany Has Apparently Made Some Preparations. German Officials Say That Germany is Currently Waiting for the Situation in Syria to Develop. However, According to German Military Practice, They Will Take Steps to Assist General Dentz in Resisting the British Vehicles Entering Syria. The Germans Believe That the British Military Strength Can Easily Defeat the French Army in Syria. However, If German Forces Intervene Swiftly, The British Will Have Less Chance of Victory. Another Newspaper's Dispatch from Berlin States That if France Has Decided That it is Not Strong Enough to Resist the British and Free French Forces Alone, Then Germany Will First Use Air Force to Intervene in the Syrian War. It is Worth Noting That the Germans Have Apparently Left Sicily and Established Bases in Greece and Dodecanese Islands, Which are More Suitable for Attacking the Eastern Mediterranean. The Germans Believe That the Battle of Crete Has Proven That They Can Transport Troops and Medium-Sized Weapons by Air. Also, a Military Correspondent for a Certain Newspaper States That the British Entry into Syria is Not Surprising Because the British Army Can Be Protected by British Aircraft Taking Off from Good Bases Such as Haifa, and the British Fleet Controlling the Sea Can Restrain Part of the Syrian Garrison, Preventing Them from Leaving the Coastal Areas. In the Coming Days, We Can See That the British are Still Hesitating Too Long, Which Leads to Failure. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Well-Informed Nazi Sources Announced Today That Germany Wants to Adopt a Strict and Reserved Attitude Towards the Attack on Syria. They Also Said That This Attitude May Change, But It Depends on the Development of the Situation. The Authorities Here Still Say, "Dealing with the Attack on Syria is Currently Vichy's Problem, But We Admit That We are Closely Monitoring Britain's Recent Aggressive Actions." (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Turkey Deeply Concerned About the Development of the Syrian Situation</h3>
<p>Turkey: The British Navy is Closely Watching to Ensure That the Germans Cannot Use Small Boats to Sail from the Dodecanese Islands to Syria. Germans Here Expect the British Navy to Land Troops on the Syrian Coast. But as Far as is Known, the British Navy's Activities Are Still Limited to Patrols. The Development of Syria Has Caused Significant Concern in Turkey, Causing the Afternoon Newspapers to Sell Out Quickly as the Public Scrambled to Buy Them. All Parties Welcome the Allied Actions and Hope That This Matter Can Be Resolved Quickly. The General Public Believes That the Allied Forces Will Do Their Best to Avoid Bloodshed. Well-Informed Sources Believe That the Resistance the British Army Will Encounter Will Be Minimal Because the French Army in Syria is Divided and Morale is Low. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: According to News from Turkey, British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen Had a Long Talk at the Turkish Foreign Ministry Yesterday. (Reuters, 10th) Ankara: Turkish Newspapers' Comments on the Allied Entry into Syria are Quite Favorable, Considering it Timely and Inevitable. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

Most of These Pilots are From the Army Air Corps in Hawaii. But There Are Also a Few Civilian Pilots Among the Volunteers. Mr. Mei Said, "I Asked Them if They Only Wanted to Go Because They Wanted Adventure. Almost All of Them Replied That They Wanted to Go Because They Felt That China is Fighting for Democratic Nations." Consul General Mei Said That He Had Not Yet Received Instructions on How to Handle These Volunteers, but He Had Asked the Chinese Military Attaché in Washington for Instructions.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Syrian Conflict</h3>
<p>The Allied Forces' invasion of Syria is not only a great misfortune for France from the perspective of the traditional relationship between Britain and France, but also a heartbreaking matter for Britain. However, from the overall international situation, Britain's preemptive action has shattered the conspiracy of Germany and Italy and eliminated a serious crisis for them.</p>
<p>Britain and France have had a long history of cooperation. During this European war, they were allies. Now, they have become enemies facing each other in battle. This will undoubtedly affect the morale and public sentiment on both sides and provide the common enemies, Germany and Italy, with materials for instigation. We only need to read the statements from the British and French sides in the last two days, the announcements from leaders of the Free French movement such as de Gaulle, and the statements from Germany and Italy to understand. When France collapsed last year, the most striking phenomenon was the widespread spread of defeatism, which was then filled with anti-British rhetoric. Germany and Italy took advantage of the opportunity to spread rumors that Britain was completely selfish, sacrificing France to preserve its own strength, and was ready to compromise with Germany and Italy at any time. Churchill and others tried to reverse the decline at that time and gave France the guarantee that the destinies of Britain and France were completely merged. However, under the circumstances that France was unilaterally attacked by German troops and attacked by Italian troops, it finally gave up resistance. On the road to humiliation, it was filled with resentment towards Britain. Therefore, Laval, Pétain, Darlan, and others, who were known for their anti-British inclinations, seized the opportunity to rise. They embraced the illusion that by taking the anti-British path, embarking on a pro-German and Italian road, and relying on overseas colonies and the remaining fleet, they could best join the German and Italian group; and at a minimum, they attempted to join a "new order" and obtain the same status as Spain and other countries, in order to achieve the so-called goal of maintaining the integrity of the French Empire. However, the Free French movement – the de Gaulle faction – which opposed them, called on all French overseas territories to unite thoroughly, cooperate with Britain, and fight to the end, seeking self-salvation for the French nation from the final victory. Comparing the two factions, the right and wrong are clear. The real reason why the Free French movement has not obtained the support of most of the country and why Britain has always been cautious and has not used military action to help them establish a base in French territory may be the obstruction of this anti-British sentiment in France. As for Laval and others, because of their concerns about the United States and their own notorious reputations, they have not been able to make France and Britain confront each other head-on. Under such circumstances, Britain would never use force against French territory unless it was absolutely necessary. The evolution of the situation is different from the past. Britain can only further emphasize its determination to thoroughly defeat Germany and Italy, so that the French people fully understand that Britain's victory is France's victory.</p>
<p>If we expand the perspective from Britain and France to the entire international community, then this Syrian event is only an inevitable consequence, and the combined efforts of Germany and Italy to move eastward are the fundamental cause. The surrender of the French Vichy authorities to Germany and Italy, using Syria as a springboard for Germany and Italy to extend into the Middle East, is the main factor that prompted its sudden outbreak. If Britain really had the so-called ambition to seize territory in Syria, as the Vichy government stated the day before yesterday, then Britain could have taken advantage of the Balkan War in the past and the tense situation in the Near East to suddenly occupy Syria from Palestine and other places without waiting for the fall of Crete and the extremely critical situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East today. If Britain occupied Syria before the situation in the Balkans changed, the French Syrian authorities would probably only have had the option of accepting cooperation with Britain at that time, and it might have affected Turkey's attitude towards the entire Balkan War. To further explore, if Britain does not take action now, then, once the forces of Germany and Italy slowly infiltrate Syria and reach a considerable number, another blitzkrieg may break out in this area, launching a large-scale attack on all of Britain's forces in the Middle East, Africa, and the Red Sea. Therefore, the public opinion in the British and American sides in the last two days has generally agreed with and praised Britain's resolute action this time. Reuters' London dispatch said that if there is any criticism of this action, then the only criticism is that it appeared too late.</p>
<p>Of course, how the Syrian event ends will have an extraordinarily significant impact on the evolution of the entire international situation in the future. From this perspective, its possible progress seems to be no more than three types: First, the Free French Army commanded by de Gaulle, Catroux, and others obtained the cooperation of most of the French army in Syria, all concentrated under the banner of the Free Movement, first ending the war between Britain and the Free French; the Syrian war that followed was only unfolded between Britain and France and Germany and Italy. Second, the British army quickly defeated the French army, and when the German and Italian armies rushed into Syria, a major war broke out between Britain and Germany and Italy. Third, assuming that the Vichy government therefore clashed head-on with Britain and fought alongside Germany and Italy, then not only would the war in Syria be prolonged because of this, but Britain would also add a new enemy, and the existence and free future of France itself would inevitably suffer more setbacks, which is undoubtedly true.</p>

<h3>Public Outrage After Handling of Chongqing Tunnel Tragedy; Newspapers Call for People to Be Paramount; Should Not Tolerate These Few Responsible Individuals</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The newspapers and citizens of Chongqing today continued to express outrage over the fact that the officials responsible for the air-raid shelter tragedy last week, in which 461 civilians died, were only dismissed but still retained their positions. The Catholic newspaper "Yishi Bao" declared, "The government should conduct a strict self-examination and punish those who should be sentenced to death. The government should not allow a few hopeless officials to remain in office and allow tragedies to happen to civilians again." The newspaper said that the committee investigating the tragedy should put the people first and not consider personal friendships with those who should be held accountable. It also said, "Chairman Chiang should not tolerate these few responsible individuals. The responsibility for this tragedy is too great." The Communist organ "Xinhua Daily" said that Chairman Chiang only nominally dismissed those responsible, which was not commensurate with their crimes. Since the tragedy occurred last Thursday, Chairman Chiang again appointed two committees today to improve the management and technical aspects of air-raid shelters. The committee appointed to improve management includes Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Commander of the Gendarmerie He Guoguang, Police Chief Tang Yi (transliteration), and Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Feng Jingzhou (transliteration). In addition, Liu Zhi, commander of the air defense, Hu Bohan, deputy commander of the air defense, and Mayor of Chongqing Wu Guozhen, who were dismissed due to the tragedy, were also appointed as members. The technical committee appointed to be organized includes Minister of Education Chen Lifu, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, and Dr. Zeng Yangfu. Wu Tiecheng, chairman of the committee investigating the tragedy, continues to study methods to prevent tragedies from happening in the future. (United Press, 10th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Striking Aircraft Factory Formally Taken Over by the Army; Workers' Picketing Line Dispersed with Tear Gas; Those Willing to Return to Work Will Be Protected by the Government</h3>
<p>Los Angeles. The Army has taken over and is operating the local plant of North American Aviation because the strikers have decided not to comply with the order to return to work and have refused the union leaders' advice to allow everyone to enter the factory. Some disturbances occurred when the striking pickets prevented those willing to return to work from entering the factory, but the troops arrived and used tear gas to disperse the pickets. Only one person resisted and was injured by a bayonet, sending him to the hospital. President Roosevelt issued an order to the Army stating that he would return the factory when it could reliably be operated by private individuals in a manner required for national defense. Secretary of War Stimson has been ordered to hire workers and handle the issue of compensating the company's losses. After hearing the news of the troops entering the factory, Fretag, the leader of the strikers, telephoned President's Secretary O'Leary saying, "Armed troops cannot break our spirit. Bombers cannot be made with bayonets. We demand higher wages, but not as a slogan." Three thousand soldiers, traveling in fifty trucks, arrived and the disturbances at the factory ceased. As the soldiers passed, those waiting to return to work cheered. The soldiers occupied the entire factory in a relaxed manner, as if it were a regular exercise. Colonel Kershaw, the commander, immediately declared that the factory was reopening under government control, that anyone willing to return to work would receive the necessary protection, and that the use of troops was necessary because the situation had gone beyond the control of the local police. After receiving the President's order, the Under Secretary of the Army telephoned Colonel Kershaw, ordering him to lead troops into the factory and provide protection for workers entering the factory to return to work and for workers leaving the factory to return home after work. The President issued a statement explaining the reasons for this action, saying that the agreement established by the workers' representatives to produce and mediate had been broken, preventing mediation from proceeding, halting production, and creating a situation that hinders national defense. "As President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, in light of this situation, I have decided to reopen the factory and ensure that work resumes immediately. Therefore, I order the Army to take over until normal operations are restored. Our country is currently in danger. Men and women who manufacture aircraft perform extremely important work in national defense. I hope the workers will return to work quickly, and their basic rights as free citizens should be protected. Negotiations will continue to establish a fair resolution." (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Inglewood. Since the Army Department, following the President's orders, took over North American Aviation, 1,000 workers have returned to the factory. Although the factory is still surrounded by picketing strikers, under police protection and after the firing of tear gas, the returning workers were able to enter the factory to work. However, a spokesperson for the factory stated that work has returned to normal, but the number of workers is too small and that several workers were beaten when passing through the blockade. Roosevelt's decisive action was taken after receiving a phone call from the Los Angeles Police Department, which stated that it could no longer control the situation at the factory. The White House announced that 1,000 workers wanted to return to work but were being blocked outside the blockade line. White House Secretary Early also said that President Roosevelt's handling of the strike had been unanimously approved at the last cabinet meeting. (10th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>One U.S. Cargo Ship Sunk by German Submarine; The Ship Was En Route from Brazil to South Africa; The Shipwrecked Crew Have Been Rescued</h3>
<p>Washington. The U.S. Navy Department has announced that it has received a report that the American cargo ship Robin Moore, bound for Cape Town, South Africa, has been sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes. This news is still unofficial, received from a wireless radio report from the ship Tielorozi, which received it from the ship Lajis, which received it from a Brazilian ship Vossoleo, which reported rescuing eleven crew members from the American ship. (10th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. The U.S. Ambassador to Brazil, Caffery, reported to the State Department from Rio de Janeiro yesterday that he had received notification that the American cargo ship Robin Moore had been sunk halfway between Brazil and West Africa. When the news reached here, the Navy Department had already announced that it had received news that the American cargo ship had been attacked with torpedoes by a German submarine. Caffery's report stated that the Brazilian ship Osorio, which rescued eleven people, had notified the authorities in the west that it could not find the three missing lifeboats, which carried twenty-seven crew members and eight passengers, including three women and one child. The Navy Department pointed out that the Navy Department's news was based on intercepted communications, which clearly stated that the American cargo ship was attacked by a German submarine with torpedoes while en route to South Africa's Cape of Good Hope.

<h3>U.S. Secretary of War Stimson Delivers Speech, Stating That Totalitarianism and Democracy Cannot Coexist</h3>
<p>New York. U.S. Secretary of War Stimson delivered a speech yesterday to the graduating class of the West Point Military Academy, stating, "President Lincoln said that a nation divided cannot stand. Today, the world is divided into two major camps of democratic and totalitarian nations, and they cannot coexist peacefully. Some say that American democracy can find a temporary solution with National Socialism and that popular politics can coexist with Fascism. This is a sign of unclear thinking and an impossible dream. America cannot survive in a world ruled by the views and habits of the Axis powers." (10th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply to the Dutch East Indies is Under Study</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Ishii, the Deputy Spokesman for the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, declined to comment today on the Dutch East Indies' response to Japan's economic demands, saying only that the Dutch East Indies' response was extremely unsatisfactory and is currently being carefully considered. Ishii declined to disclose the content of the Dutch East Indies' reply. He acknowledged that if Japan accepts the Dutch counter-proposals, the Batavia negotiations will continue. He said that nothing has been determined regarding this matter because the Japanese government has not yet decided on its next step. He declined to state whether Japan's chief representative, Yoshizawa, will be recalled from Batavia, pointing out that this will also be decided by the Tokyo government.

<h3>Conclusion of Japan-Soviet Trade Agreement Will Take Time; Japanese Newspaper Hopes Soviet Foreign Minister Will Visit Japan This Summer</h3>
<p>Tokyo. When the Information Bureau spokesman met with news reporters today, he stated regarding negotiations with the Soviet Union that the technical issues of concluding a trade agreement will require considerable time to resolve and that negotiations on concluding a permanent fishing agreement are still in progress. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Hochi Shimbun published an article stating that it is rumored that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Japan this summer. Although this news has not been confirmed by Soviet officials, it may become a reality. This trip could greatly eliminate long-standing unresolved issues between Japan and the Soviet Union and consolidate the permanent friendship between the two countries. The newspaper quoted the proverb "Actions speak louder than words," saying that during his visit to the Soviet Union, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka achieved in the final ten minutes of friendly talks what had been sought but not achieved for the past ten years. Molotov went to Germany and returned successfully, so if he visits Japan this time, he will surely have the same success. If the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact has laid the foundation for friendly relations between the two countries, then the conclusion of a trade agreement, the resolution of fishing issues, and the resolution of border disputes all require attention. The resolution of various issues between Japan and the Soviet Union is not only beneficial to Japan but is also urgently needed from the Soviet Union's perspective. The tide of the German-Italian New Order is now rapidly passing through the Balkans, especially as Hitler's Near East policy seeks to seize both Iran and Afghanistan in one fell swoop.

<h3>Commander of the British Far East Fleet Delivers Radio Address, Praising the Importance of Singapore as a Stabilizing Factor in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>Singapore. Vice Admiral Layton, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, recently stated that the naval base in Singapore has become the most stable factor in the Pacific region. Layton declared, "If war spreads to the Far East, you will see the British naval flag once again covering the seas." Layton's words, which were broadcast, have the effect of preparing for any aggression. Without this naval base, the South Pacific would be at the mercy of any aggressor. Layton also said that this naval base is prepared to accommodate a large fleet and can be used by Allied fleets, providing any fleet with the necessary supplies and assistance. Layton also greatly praised the United States for providing Singapore with major military supplies. The Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, in praising the British Dominions, Allied navies, naval volunteers, and merchant fleets, said, "When I say the British navy, I include the navies of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, India, Malaya, and Hong Kong. Recently, you have not been able to give sufficient importance to the navy in Singapore. Before the war, most of the Far East Fleet was stationed elsewhere for other needs, because it was more beneficial to serve there. But we should not consider this fact as a lack of attention to the Far East. If war spreads to the Far East, you will see the British naval flag once again covering the seas here. In recent months, you have seen the army and air force gradually arriving here, and military equipment is also flowing in. These reinforcements come from the United Kingdom, Australia, and India, and there is also equipment from the aforementioned places and the United States. Without this influx of equipment, it would be of no use. You only recognize the great material assistance of the United States by looking at the sky and seeing fighter jets, medium and heavy bombers. You must know that in addition to these obvious things, there is also a large amount of aid flowing in under the Lend-Lease Act." Layton further pointed out that the naval base in Singapore is prepared to fully play its role in accommodating a fleet that comes and goes at sea, saying, "In our minds, we have always thought of making Singapore a base capable of accommodating an Allied fleet and our own fleet. This plan is ready, and even tomorrow, we can provide any fleet with the necessary supplies and assistance." He also said that the strength of the British navy in the Pacific has clearly made Singapore the greatest stabilizing factor in the Pacific. This base, together with Hong Kong and Darwin, has a great effect in preventing any aggression. "The importance of Singapore has therefore increased in relation to the bases of our friendly countries in this region. It is no exaggeration to say that without Singapore, the South Pacific would be at the mercy of the aggressors." Layton also said that troops and guns have arrived here from the Allied countries, but these troops and equipment are still part of an activity that has been going on for months. Layton further pointed out that the fleet's aircraft play the most important role in defending Malaya. Layton revealed that preparations for the fleet's aircraft to arrive here have long been planned, and said, "I dare to tell you that these important naval aircraft can even take off from Singapore tomorrow to fight." Regarding the situation of naval activities, Layton said that in addition to the navy engaged in escorting and protecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans, there are also a large number of fleets operating very close to the coast of Malaya. "Many mines have been laid in all strategic areas along the coast of Malaya. In the past three months, we have also added many mines in case of emergency. Our navy continues to clear enemy mines in the straits near Singapore and patrols from time to time. As for the requisitioned ships, they are now used by naval volunteers, the Royal Navy, and the Malayan Navy." (10th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Search for Ships of All Sizes, Preparing for a Joint Sea and Air General Offensive; Nazis Relive the Old Dream of Kaiser Wilhelm, Attempting to Extend Their Reach to the Near East and Seize Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Istanbul. Germany and Italy are currently searching every nook and cranny along the entire coast, from Constanta (Romania) to Genoa (Italy), at a frenzied pace, with no omissions, in preparation for an unprecedented, massive joint sea and air general offensive. Judging from the distribution of personnel, ships, and aircraft, observers believe that this general offensive will proceed on two fronts: one southward from Libya to capture Egypt, and the other into Syria to seize the Near East oil fields. According to German engineers and oil specialists who have passed through this city, the Nazi Party has clearly relived Kaiser Wilhelm's old dream of political control and railways directly from Berlin to Baghdad (the Three B's Railway). The preparations for the German expeditionary force in Greece are extremely secretive. Only German and Italian personnel and ships are allowed to enter and exit. Private traffic remains prohibited. Nationals of neutral countries such as Turkey and the United States are still not allowed to leave the country, and even American diplomatic couriers are unable to deliver their letters. It is believed that traffic in Greece will not be opened until after the general offensive begins. The lifeline of the Axis offensive is oil, so all oil tankers, large and small, in Italy have been thoroughly searched and are sailing to the Black Sea to transport oil. However, most of the Greek oil tankers have been transported away by the British, so the Axis powers are desperately searching for all available ships, even using barges on the Danube River. A batch of these ships has already passed through this city, carrying oil to Rhodes Island. Other ships are constantly loading day and night in Constanta. (10th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Troops Move North in the Balkans, Forcing the Soviet Union to Allow Passage</h3>
<p>Ankara. Well-informed diplomatic circles stated yesterday that the German high command has begun a large-scale troop movement, shifting from its current positions in the southern Balkans northwards, apparently in an attempt to exert pressure on the Soviet Union, forcing it to allow German troops to pass through to Iran. These sources stated that the German high command is concentrating a large army in Moldova, purely to pressure the Soviet Union to allow German troops to proceed by sea and land from Constanta to Baku. From Baku, German troops would be able to enter Iran by train and truck. At that time, Nazi troops could seize British oil supplies, invade Iraq, and encircle Syria. Diplomatic circles also believe that German troops will once again exert pressure on Turkey, at a minimum forcing it to allow military supplies to enter Syria. However, they do not believe that Germany will make excessive demands that would lead to a conflict between the two countries. It is reported that British reconnaissance aircraft have confirmed that German troops have gathered hundreds of aircraft on Rhodes Island, and a large German army has also been concentrated there, waiting to board aircraft to enter Syria.

<h3>Hull Meets with French Ambassador, Clarifies U.S. Position, Remains Seriously Concerned About French-German Cooperation, Deplorable to Fight with Former Allies</h3>
<p>Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Hull told the French Ambassador, Henri Haye, during their meeting yesterday that he was dismayed that France had failed to prevent the German invasion of Syria and had instead immediately attacked British and Free French forces. It is reported that Hull also told the French Ambassador that it was deplorable if France were to fight with its former allies. Hull also told the French Ambassador that German troops appeared to have entered Syria, adding that German troops seemed to need Syria for large-scale military operations. The French Ambassador also expressed to Hull the anger of the French people at the British-French conflict in Syria. He also said that he hoped the war would only be a local incident, but declared, "Once fire is opened, accidents may happen." The French Ambassador also reiterated that there were no Axis troops in Syria. (10th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. The French Ambassador to the United States, Henri Haye, visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday for an hour and expressed the French people's anger at the sudden attack on Syria. Afterwards, according to the State Department, the U.S. government saw no reason to change its serious concerns about French-German cooperation. According to well-informed sources, the Germans are using Syria to conduct aerial warfare against British forces in Iraq. France failed to defend Syria to prevent the Germans from using it, so British forces took action to enter Syria. The question now is what attitude will the French adopt. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anniversary of Italy's Entry into the War; Mussolini's Speech</h3>
<p>Rome. Mussolini delivered a speech in Rome today, stating that all of Greece, including Athens, would be occupied by Italy. Greece has re-entered Italy's sphere of influence in the Mediterranean. Mussolini also solemnly declared, "I will return to Abyssinia. All the dead will be avenged. Japan cannot ignore the aggressive threats of the United States. Spain must not abandon its only opportunity to connect with the Axis powers. The intervention of the United States in the war will not trouble us. True suitability for war is no different from the current state of unsuitability for war." (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome. On the anniversary of Italy's entry into the war, the military here reviewed the war situation, saying that the Axis control of the air over the Adriatic and Aegean Seas was the biggest achievement of the year. The gains and losses of land are not enough to determine victory or defeat. Today, the position of British forces in the Mediterranean is in extreme danger. Although Italian East Africa and North Africa have suffered setbacks, the impact is minimal. During the year, 17,622 Italian army soldiers were killed, 45,779 were wounded, and 132,523 were missing. 1,075 Navy personnel were killed, 1,301 were wounded, and 6,146 were missing. 514 Air Force personnel were killed, 825 were wounded, and 1,613 were missing. 14,390 enemy aircraft were shot down. 2,212 Italian aircraft were lost.

<h3>British Parliament Reconvenes; Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation; Expresses Determination to Defend the Middle East; Refuses to Comment on the Hess Affair</h3>
<p>London. Prime Minister Churchill's response today, starting at 2:46 p.m., was moderate in tone but extremely firm, stating that Britain is continuing to transport military equipment to the Middle East through various small routes and methods. "We are currently doing our best to build the strongest possible air force in the Middle East." The Prime Minister also warned the entire House that a complete explanation would inevitably leak valuable information to the enemy. The Prime Minister continued, "National production has not been disrupted, but air raids have indeed increased. The average monthly output of artillery and tanks in the first three months of 1941 increased by 50 percent compared to the last three months of 1940. We are currently maintaining the Battle of the Atlantic well. May was actually one of the best months in the Atlantic." (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Ying-Tu Plan Alleviates the Tense Relations Between Britain and Japan; Grew's Letter to Two Christians Acknowledges That the Time Is Not Yet Ripe for the U.S. to Convene a Peace Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo—According to current reports, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie's meeting with Yōsuke Matsuoka last week was primarily to explore the Japanese Foreign Minister's views on adjusting relations between the two countries. The Japanese side pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu last Thursday was also a similar attempt. The British side sincerely hopes to use the opportunity of Shigemitsu's return to his country next month to ease the tension between Britain and Japan. Moreover, after Germany's great victory in the eastern Mediterranean, there is a growing rift between Britain and France. Therefore, Japan is in a position to demand favorable terms from Britain. However, Japanese nationalists oppose any reconciliation between Britain and Japan or the U.S. due to British aid to China and economic resistance against Japan. Meanwhile, Japanese moderates hope to avoid signing a non-aggression pact, and this matter is currently being considered in Tokyo and Washington. Diplomatic circles believe that the Axis powers are seeking to draw Japan closer to Germany and Italy to confront the democracies, which is why Axis envoys met with Matsuoka several times last week.

<p>Washington—The Navy Department received a report that the American ship Robin Moor was sunk in the South Atlantic by a German submarine torpedo. This news is still awaiting confirmation, so the Navy Department has not released the original telegram received by commercial traffic circles. According to investigations, this news was initially sent by the Brazilian merchant ship Vasso Lirio via wireless telegraph and subsequently relayed by the ships Velox and Dilwroth. It is reported that Vasso Lirio discovered a lifeboat carrying many survivors. The State Department and Maritime Commission both stated that they had not received any information. According to the Maritime Commission, the Robin Moor belonged to the Seas Shipping Company of New York and carried goods such as automobiles and steel, but no munitions. (Reuters report, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo—It was learned today that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew's recent reply to a petition from Tokyo Christian workers was not authorized by Washington. These workers had previously urged local American residents to support the "Keep America Out of War" movement. Grew's reply stated that he deeply sympathized with the hope of keeping America out of the war, but "I believe that circumstances are about to compel us to fight for our own interests, not only for the future security of our country and the preservation of the American way of life, but also to ensure that the world enjoys a just peace and order." It is widely believed that Grew's letter was of his own accord or was issued in response to the appeal from Christian workers published in the "Japan Times and Advertiser" on June 1st. Grew's letter, dated June 3rd, was sent by the embassy for distribution. The last paragraph of the letter stated, "You are welcome to share this letter with any friends." In his letter, Grew cited a recent Gallup poll, saying that 60 percent of American families with young people of military age believe that they should enter the war if there is no other way to defeat Germany, and 85 percent of Americans believe that the United States will participate in the war before it ends. Grew continued, "You must also admit that these figures are more than sufficient to represent public opinion." He also addressed their suggestion that the U.S. launch a conference to establish a just peace order, saying, "I largely agree, but you did not specify when to take this action. In other words, I believe that you would not want the United States to convene this conference before the time is right." Grew said that based on various facts, convening such a conference at this time would inevitably fail. The Ambassador pointed out that Germany has been preparing for war for the past 75 years and has launched five wars. He concluded that Germany's current empire would not be satisfied with a just peace and order, and that one of their basic life philosophies is warfare. "I am not referring specifically to the means advocated by the Treaty of Versailles or by short-sighted European politicians in general after the last European war, but I am actually judging based on past history that Germany has never expressed satisfaction with any peace, whether the peace itself is beneficial or detrimental to them." Grew also said that the Nazis have repeatedly made promises but have never kept them, and Führer Hitler has repeatedly threatened the Western Hemisphere and the United States, so a just peace is currently impossible. He also said, "I believe that this is our war, and I share the sentiments of 79 percent of my countrymen who believe that we are already at war, even though we have not engaged in a real war. We should not be complacent in a mirage of current happiness and sit idly by as this pain expands, nor should we be short-sighted and claim that we can avoid danger. We should take decisive action once and for all to save the world's political situation." (United Press report, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Warships Sunk in the Battle of Crete; Britain Admits to Losing Twelve Vessels</h3>

<h3>Random Thoughts on the European War (63): The Seriousness of the Atlantic War</h3>
<p>But the most important difference between now and then lies in the strength of the German Air Force. After Germany occupied bases in northern Norway and southern France, it was like adding wings to a tiger. The Germans initially used aircraft only for reconnaissance and to spread magnetic mines, and then created long-range fighters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor and the Junkers Ju 290, which could cross half of the Atlantic Ocean in one round trip. As a result, they used aircraft to carry out sabotage work as well. Even if Britain had the excellent base of Ireland, it would be useless without long-range fighters.</p>
<p>The fall of France also had a major impact. After Germany seized a portion of the French warships, it discovered that they were equipped with secret weapons to attack submarines, such as submarine detectors. After studying them, the Germans used new tactics to deal with them.</p>
<p>During the last European War, Britain was able to freely use the Mediterranean Sea as a supply route. This time, since Italy joined the war, Britain has not been able to take the shortcut. Since June of last year, Britain has only once assembled a large convoy to pass through the Mediterranean Sea, and as a result, it was heavily attacked by German and Italian dive bombers. The light cruiser HMS Southampton was sunk, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious was severely damaged. As a result of this threat, British merchant ships not only had to detour around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, but also had to dispatch a large number of warships to the Mediterranean Sea, which weakened the defensive strength of the Atlantic Ocean. Germany seized this opportunity to dispatch raiding ships to disrupt British merchant ships by stealth.</p>
<p>Also, during the last European War, the threat of submarines was the only terrifying thing. Now, there are endless things to fear. According to Britain's recent announcement, the causes of shipwrecks are as follows: those sunk by submarines accounted for 39 percent, those sunk by aircraft accounted for 23 percent, those sunk by mines accounted for 22 percent, and those sunk by warships and for unknown reasons each accounted for 8 percent. Moreover, since Germany began using long-range aircraft for bombing, the number of merchant ships lost to aerial bombs has become even more considerable.</p>
<p>Britain's current convoy plan is drawn up daily by the Admiralty. In the map room of the gray old Admiralty building near Trafalgar Square in London, a group of officers and staff surround a huge map table every morning, inserting colored pins into the map. Each pin represents a ship, and its color identifies whether it is a convoy ship or an independent ship, and whether it is on its way out or on its way back.</p>
<p>After the map room staff mark the exact location of each ship at sea with pins, they hand the map over to another room for convoy experts to carefully study. Based on information about the locations of German submarines, raiding ships, and aircraft activity, they determine the safest route. In the afternoon, this map and the planned route are sent to the Naval Staff for review and approval. Finally, it is transmitted by wireless telegraph to the headquarters of Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches, in a port in western Britain.</p>
<p>Admiral Horton and his subordinates then issue orders by wireless telegraph to each ship at sea. If it is a convoy, the escort ships, usually two destroyers, are notified, and a medium-sized cruiser is inserted to protect 20 to 60 merchant ships.</p>
<p>The serious situation of British merchant ship losses is a source of anxiety for everyone from Prime Minister Churchill to ordinary citizens. How Britain can obtain 3 to 4 million tons of merchant ships this year to make up for the current rate of loss in order to sustain itself until next year is a difficult problem. Relying solely on Britain's own shipbuilding rate is absolutely impossible. Britain's shipbuilding performance this year will be at most one million tons, and after the bombing of various shipyards, it may be reduced to around 750,000 tons.</p>
<p>Meat is Britain's main import (Note 4). Since the start of the war, due to disrupted supply routes, the weekly purchase limit for beef, lamb, and pork has been gradually reduced from two shillings and two pence to one shilling, which can buy one pound. The shortage of alloy metals should not be underestimated either. The assembly of army tanks can no longer use alloy steel and must use more brittle steel instead.</p>
<p>The general public in British society hopes that the United States will come to their aid. The British delegation in Washington hopes that the United States will help with 500 to 600 tons of merchant ships. Prime Minister Churchill also said that Britain's future prospects depend on the United States building ships on a large scale, as it did in 1918. However, increasing the shipbuilding rate cannot be done in a short period of time. The highest shipbuilding rate in the United States this year will be at most 1.1 million tons (Note 5).</p>
<p>Of course, the United States has other ways to help Britain, and President Roosevelt has already prepared some of them or has already implemented them. The 290,000 tons of German, Italian, and Danish merchant ships that the President has detained (which is equivalent to three weeks of losses for British ships) may be transferred to Britain. As for the U.S. ships sailing to the Red Sea, the hundreds of new ships built under the Lend-Lease Act with $500 million, and the convenience of allowing British merchant ships to be repaired in U.S. ports, although they are good measures, they all take time and cannot take effect immediately. The only effective action that the United States can truly take this year is to implement ship escort or send naval aircraft to assist the convoys in reconnaissance work.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The tonnage of merchant ships owned by various countries at the outbreak of this European War was as follows: Britain 21,215,261 tons, the United States 14,612,991 tons, Japan 5,629,845 tons, Norway 4,834,902 tons, Germany 4,492,708 tons, the United States 3,448,453 tons, the Netherlands 2,972,871 tons, France 2,952,975 tons, Greece 1,780,666 tons, Sweden 1,581,919 tons, the Soviet Union 1,315,766 tons, and Denmark 1,176,173 tons.</p>
<p>(Note 2) From June to November 1940, British merchant ship losses were the heaviest, averaging 63,000 tons per week. The week of September 14 to 20 was the highest, reaching 200,5781 tons.</p>

<h3>Food: Imported Rice Prices Constantly Rising; Over 67,000 Bags of Saigon Rice Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>The imported rice market, which had once weakened in the previous period, was reactivated yesterday by domestic merchants and rural customers taking advantage of lower prices. The early opening saw tight conditions, followed by speculators and new major hoarding households joining in the fray, causing a stir in the market. Prices rose repeatedly amid support, with rumors spreading of an American ship being lost en route (which was actually unrelated to the rice market). This, coupled with the stimulus of the previous day's small shipments being blocked, caused both spot and futures rice prices to rise by two to three yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice reached 120 yuan, high-quality Min rice reached 122 yuan, Shanghai Pudong small shipments reached 115.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice reached 112 yuan, Huowen rice reached 118 yuan, and Sui Jian rice reached 93 yuan. At this point, the buying momentum weakened, and speculators who had profited began to sell at high prices, causing the upward trend to subside. Da Fu foreign firm then offered 2,000 tons of small shipments at 136.5 yuan, as well as No. 1 Siam rice at 131.5 yuan and No. 2 at 127 yuan. Customers from inland Ningbo and other areas, whose previous orders had not yet been cleared, returned to the market to sell, and those who had profited also took the opportunity to sell at high prices, causing the market to turn downward. Except for broken rice, which still had some demand, other prices dropped by two to three yuan. As a result, broken rice saw a relatively large increase of nearly one yuan. The spot price for No. 1 rice from Yinghua Company opened at 136.5 yuan, small Huowen rice at 137-138 yuan, and broken rice at 108.5-108 yuan. The total transaction volume for Yinghua Company was 700-800 tons, and the spot rice volume was 12,000-13,000 bags.</p>
<p>The sales of thick and thin Japonica rice in the local market were still sluggish. Fortunately, the supply was also scarce, so the market remained flat. The price of early and late rice from Nan Gang was still 126-127 yuan for fresh specialty grade, 134-135 yuan for ordinary grade, and 130 yuan for second grade. Unopened original bags of thin Japonica rice from Wuxi were 121-122 yuan.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Yuan price of glutinous rice continued to rise amid reports of scarce goods, and market sentiment was unusually firm. Selling prices continued to rise, with special grade round grain from Hong Kong opening at 117-118 yuan, long grain rising from 115-116 yuan to 113 yuan. Only second-grade glutinous green beans were offered yesterday at 102-103 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice was expensive and of poor quality, and sales were flat, making it difficult to compete with the Hong Kong Yuan price. It could only maintain its position without any significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>Jin Diya of the French company continued to ship tribute rice, which arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 9th). 14,500 bags of foreign rice were shipped from Saigon, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the company's D'Artagnan postal ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying a large amount of foreign rice weighing 6,680 tons, totaling over 67,000 bags, which docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload.

<h3>Current Price of Vermicelli Follows High Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Spot vermicelli trading has gradually become more active, due to the increasing transshipment volume by merchants from northern China. The opening prices were 28.8 yuan for Golden Dragon vermicelli, 28.9 yuan for God of Wealth vermicelli, 30.015 yuan for Battery vermicelli, and 30.02 yuan for Flower Bird vermicelli, all rising steadily. In the afternoon, the market improved further. Golden Dragon vermicelli was favored by hoarding households and jumped over the 29 yuan mark to 29.3 yuan, a gain of 0.7 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was approximately 20,000 bags, and the market began to show signs of expansion.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat trading remained quiet. Although new wheat has entered the market, production is not high, and shipments to Shanghai are still complicated. In addition, the supply of old wheat in the city has dried up, and factories have no appetite to purchase. Therefore, the market remains stagnant.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybean Cake Bears Dominate</h3>
<p>The market conditions for miscellaneous grains yesterday were mostly small-scale. Soybean cakes continued to be strong, but prices fluctuated up and down. As a result, the bears dominated, and the market fell by another one to two jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction volume for all cakes was 33,000-34,000 pieces. Yellow soybeans remained weak, and although sales to local oil extraction factories continued, the volume was not large. Therefore, the supply was plentiful but sales were slow, and the market was often in a state of prolonged weakness. At the time of rushing to purchase new broad beans, the price once tightened and rose, but recently, due to high prices and poor quality, customer sales have been disconnected. Local sales on the street are still feeling excessive, resulting in lower prices. Yesterday, 300 bags of new white broad beans from Jiading were traded at a price of 39.5 yuan per original plate. The market for corn was still acceptable, but due to high inventories, it was difficult to cause a special surge. The fleeting boom that occurred previously has reversed, and prices have fallen again by one to two yuan. The total transaction volume for new and old yellow and white corn was approximately 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits: High Production Price of Xiamen Tangerine Cakes</h3>
<p>Due to the high production price of Xiamen tangerine cakes, there have been no recent arrivals. According to a letter from the production area, the price that can be agreed upon for shipment to Shanghai has exceeded the previous market price by more than double. Therefore, we have not dared to try for the time being. It is necessary to wait until the selling price is close to the price that customers can accept before there can be continued arrivals.</p>
<h3>Finance: Speculators Madly Infill Foreign Exchange at Noon, Exceeding the Volume Traded in the Morning</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market conditions yesterday saw no change in the HSBC-posted rates for various currencies. However, the black market for British and U.S. exchange suddenly turned soft. In the morning opening, Chinese speculators were the first to cover their positions, infilling more than 100,000 U.S. dollars. Hong Kong telegrams also came to cover their positions. At that time, Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. and foreign banks were providing supply, and the volume was relatively abundant. The prices at this time were relatively flat, and at noon foreign telegrams reported news of an American merchant ship being sunk again by Germany in the South Atlantic. Speculators turned to madly infill, exceeding the volume covered since the morning opening. The next-month price of U.S. dollars, 5.40625 yuan, was once difficult to sell. The price of British gold also hardened to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence. In the afternoon, speculative selling intentions decreased slightly, and Chinese banks absorbed less, so the trend stabilized. The closing price for British long was 0.015625, and the closing price for U.S. long was 0.03125. The overall trading volume for the day was quite active.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Parties Infills at Morning Market</p>
<p>Since the morning foreign telegrams showed that the silver market in England, America, and India had not changed, the exchange rate for U.S. dollars against Shanghai alone was slightly lower, with the rest unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates for various currencies did not change. The bank selling prices in the domestic market opened flat in the morning. The spot price for British exchange was 3 shillings and 296875 pence, and the spot price for U.S. dollars was 5.34375 yuan. Chinese speculators, following the trend of infilling the previous day, covered their positions for the June U.S. exchange price of 5.34375 yuan, totaling tens of thousands of yuan. At that time, foreign banks' willingness to supply was still strong, and the HSBC-posted rates for various currencies were flat. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 2.375 percent, Japanese banks Mitsui &amp; Co. sold out the July price of 5.375 yuan. Foreign firms were short on supply, and Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegrams again came to cover their July price of 5.379 yuan. At noon, negative news arrived, and speculators turned to madly infill the July price of 5.40625 yuan, which once hardened to the point where it was difficult to sell, but it soon recovered slightly. The noon closing price for British exchange was 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the noon closing price for U.S. dollars was 5.375 yuan.</p>
<p>Both British and U.S. Exchange Sees "Long" Prices</p>
<p>The afternoon market was sluggish and trading was scarce. A Chinese bank intended to infuse speculator's July U.S. Dollar contract for 5.390625 Yuan, but did not open. The 3:30 PM closing price, both spot and for the July contract, saw British exchange at 3 shillings and 3.25 pence, and U.S. Dollars at 5.375 yuan, compared to the previous day's closing price, with the spot price for both British and U.S. exchange seeing a "long" price of 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Telegrams Sell Off, Pressing Down Gold Prices; But Settlement Is Based on the U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate, Only Doing the 5 Yuan Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the heated black market for gold saw slight changes, initially rising slightly, then suddenly falling sharply, and then returning to a plateau. After breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark, it immediately fell back in. This was because foreign exchange brokers were the first to sell off at high prices. Heng Ji Silver Company also sold off 3,000-4,000 taels on behalf of Hong Kong telegrams, suppressing the rising trend. As a result, foreign exchange began to soften, and prices became unsustainable, leading to a rebound and decline. Near noon, news of an American merchant ship being sunk by a German submarine spread, and sellers became even more enthusiastic. Under the condition of prices being easy to suppress and difficult to raise, the price retreated from 6,506 yuan to 6,450 yuan. At noon, floating shorts covered their positions, slightly raising the price. In the afternoon, foreign exchange stabilized, and the price fluctuated only by 15 yuan, around 6,470 yuan. The final decline was small, at 22 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was over 30,000 taels. The closing price was 6,472-3 yuan. Spot gold saw even less improvement. Cheng Ji sold 100 taels in the morning, and Xiang Xing Yong sold 20 taels, both of which were purchased by Shi He at a price 250 yuan higher than the futures price. In the afternoon, De Fu sold 100 taels to Xiang He, and entered and exited Shi He at 40 taels, all at a price 255 yuan higher. Shi He also entered 90 taels from Cheng Ji at a price 252 yuan higher, resulting in a small decline of 30 yuan. The price of jewelry gold also fell by 5 yuan, totaling 690 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Only Fall by 22 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening price for each bar (10 taels) in the morning at 9:15 was 6,505 yuan, 9 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. It then saw 6,506 yuan. Xin Feng Yong, Da Feng, De Da, and Ren Cheng Yong came to sell, and the price immediately retreated to 6,485 yuan, due to floating longs entering the market. The Gold Trade Association helped push the price up to 6,494 yuan. The Securities Association sold off, and the price plateaued at around 6,485 yuan for a long time. Near noon, negative rumors suddenly arose, and He Sheng, Sui Fu, Heng Ji, De Da, Yu Qing Yong, and retail investors sold aggressively. The price plunged by more than 30 yuan to 6,450 yuan. Xiang Yu Yong and Jin Yuan entered aggressively, raising the price to 6,465 yuan, and then it fell again. The noon closing price was 6,459 yuan. The market opened 6 yuan higher at 2:00 pm, reaching 6,465 yuan. He Sheng and Ren Cheng Yong sold off a small amount to 6,460 yuan. Chi Da, Xin Feng Yong, and De Fu came to buy in. The market trend was extremely stable, and the price rose to 6,475 yuan. The closing price at 3:30 was 6,474 yuan, a decline of 22 yuan. The settlement price based on the June U.S. dollar rate of 5.375 yuan was 6,479 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan. The fluctuations for the whole day were 56 yuan. The selling price of the current gold of Yu Hao was 270 yuan higher than the heated futures price, and the purchase price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current margin.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Fall by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at jewelry stores at 10:00 am was 690 yuan, 5 yuan lower according to Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang. The purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Remittance Water Rises, Once Exceeding 10 Yuan; Then Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance drafts fluctuated greatly, once reaching over 10 yuan for those selling cash, and then gradually declining to 1 yuan. The other side leveled off, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's overnight interest rate suddenly fell by 4 points, with both morning and afternoon markets posting 3 points.</p>
<h3>No Significant Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the spot price of silver fall, both spot and forward. British and American gold pounds each fell by one yuan. British gold notes remained stagnant, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes opened at 3.7 jiao and retreated to 2 jiao, closing at 18.25 yuan, a decrease of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a stable trend. Singapore notes had a slight increase in supply, and the market price was slightly weak. Japanese gold notes rebounded after falling, remaining at 1.92 yuan in the evening session. Korean notes showed a slight upward trend, rising to 1.63 yuan in the evening session.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Gradually Weakening</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market continued its downward trend yesterday. After satisfying many parties, there has been covert selling. Yesterday morning, De Fu Hong bought more, and Lianhe Yu, Da Yi, and Tai also had demand. Initially, Xie sold out a lot, and Lianyi also released bonds. Near the close, Yi sold out a large amount, further driving down the market. The noon close was slightly down by 4 or 5 jiao. However, there were very few Ding-type transactions, so they slightly increased by 3 jiao. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Lian He continued to buy, Runde bought Type B bonds, and Da De bought Type A bonds. The opening market was slightly higher, but Ding Kang sold a lot, Xie Kang and Lian Yi continued to sell, and Tong Kang exchanged Type E for Type C. The market price continued to weaken. As a result, except for Type D, which did not open in the afternoon and rose by 3 jiao, the rest consistently decreased by 3 to 5.5 jiao. The total turnover was approximately 2.2 million to 2.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 1,000 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 7.95 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was relatively active, with several stocks experiencing significant price increases. Xiangtai Timber surged the fastest, reaching a high price of 48.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson also rose to 96 yuan. Reclamation shares were at 24.25 yuan. Sentiment towards industrial shares generally improved, while rubber shares remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Sales Not Weak; Shuangma Initially Rose but Ultimately Fell</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then softened, but actual transactions continued uninterrupted. Twenty-count Shuangma yarn was reportedly being shipped overseas, leading some to expect prices to rise. However, gold and securities traders mostly used the margin as a guide, fluctuating quickly, making it difficult to predict. As a result, changes were rapid. It was found that Hong Kong traders bought a huge 2,690 bales of various yarns. Based on this, the market should have been optimistic. However, some speculators believed that the Pacific issue had not yet been resolved, and since the high point could not break through 460 yuan, selling intentions were strong. As rumors spread, prices declined again. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,458 yuan, and the low price was 1,434 yuan. The afternoon momentum was not as lively as the previous day, but the market was soft yet firm. The initial price was 1,441 yuan, rose to 1,446 yuan, fell back to 1,439 yuan, and the final price was 1,441.2 yuan. This morning, 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened this morning, continuing the enthusiasm of the previous day, with the opening price at 1,458 yuan. Many profitable traders sold at this price, leading to a tight situation. Shortly after, it fell slightly to 1,449 yuan. There was a struggle in this 50-yuan range. Then, news came that the margin had eased, and rumors spread again, saying that an American merchant ship had been attacked, causing panic. It fell immediately to 1,436 yuan. However, the sales of spot yarn were not weak, and many people bought at the low price, pushing it back up to 1,442 yuan. The closing price was 1,439 yuan. It was found that the total turnover for half a day was 9,790 bales. The amount bought by each trading group is listed as follows: Hong Kong 2,690, Domestic 7,100, Total 9,790.</p>
<p>Due to the strong upward trend of the previous day, the futures market for Jin Shuangma label yarn experienced a slight reversal. At the same time, profitable traders sold off, and the market loosened. It was found that the July contract fell by 7 yuan compared to the previous day, and the August contract fell by 16.5 yuan. The total turnover for the front and back sessions was approximately 5,000 bales. The high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Front Session  Afternoon Session</p>
<p>July</p>
<p>Open  1398  1380</p>
<p>Close  1381  1384</p>
<p>Daily High  1399  Low 1380</p>
<p>August</p>
<p>Open  1404  1394</p>
<p>Close  1387.5  1393.5</p>
<p>Daily High  1405  Low 1383</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Prospering: Brazilian Cotton Mills Have Fixed Prices</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is very profitable because American cotton is rising daily, and sentiment is firm. Therefore, fine cotton is only rising and not falling. However, coarse cotton is far less strong than fine cotton. Although the opening trading volume for factory brands Liangcheng Fang is not as high as in the previous days, it can be said to be quite busy. Overall, the scene is promising. Yesterday, a total of 740 pieces and 1,500 bales were traded, with prices falling by 1-2 yuan.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 418 Anda Factory 100 pieces factory</p>
<p>Indian NT 400 Shenxin Factory 200 pieces plus</p>
<p>Changyinsha 250 plus 960 bales plus</p>
<p>Midlin 428 Haojia 100 pieces stack</p>
<p>Plus 431 Plus 140 pieces plus</p>
<p>Plus 426 Plus 100 pieces plus</p>
<p>Sudan Cotton 514 Plus 100 pieces plus</p>
<p>Huocaobao 188.5 Plus 540 bales plus</p>
<p>In addition, according to Shanghai's foreign cotton trade by foreign firms, the yarn market is gradually rising, and the international situation is developing favorably, which has boosted confidence and led to enthusiastic buying. Factories such as Shenxin and Yong'an, and traders such as Dachang and Shunda, have all traded large quantities of Brazilian cotton. As American and Indian cotton continue to rise, everyone expects prices to rise, so the future of the cotton market is expected to be prosperous.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially rose sharply due to foreign merchants buying, but then fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, closing prices were 9 to 16 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market also rose due to cotton merchants constantly replenishing Amra, with closing prices rising by 2 to 7 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 1.5 rupees due to the strong rise in American cotton.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Ewo Coarse Cloth Exceptionally Strong</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, and the quoted prices of various cloths changed very little. However, due to the varying amount of actual sales, some prices fluctuated slightly. As a result, Ewo coarse cloth rose by 2.5 jiao due to the factory's firm stance and continued purchases by Nanyang traders. Coarse twill fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao due to the gradually increasing inventory. Some of Ewo Lun Chang's bleached and dyed cloths rose by 5 jiao. Approximately 300 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders bought over 200 pieces of colored cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and twill. Nanyang traders bought over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 1,230 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning market fell with the yarn. The afternoon market saw the Longtou fine cloth stack fall to 44.5 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge to 1.4445 yuan. The market stabilized in the afternoon as Shuangma rebounded. Longtou fine cloth rose back to 44.7 yuan, and Serge closed at 1.444875 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Forward Sugar Settling; Spot Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the June 10th forward sugar expired. It was heard that some people in the vegetable industry had completed delivery according to the Public Concession rules, but others were still in a stalemate. It was found that the sharp drop in prices this time was due to market forces, not due to short sellers driving down the price. It is clear from the recent spot market trading that the bullish side did not make high claims against the Public Concession. The Public Concession's trading for May arrival of spot goods 24 coarse white foreign stack initially fell by 5 jiao to 93 yuan, and then fell by 9 jiao to 92.1 yuan, a total decrease of 1.4 yuan. There was a lack of follow-up market, indicating that supply exceeded demand and it would not be easy to raise prices for a while.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Balls Gradually Stabilizing - 10 Yuan Cheaper on the Grey Market</h3>
<p>The price of coal balls has been gradually falling and stabilizing recently since the factory price was increased by 20 yuan at the beginning of the month, which caused much resentment from all sectors. Although the list price of each factory is still 316 yuan, the grey market price is 10 yuan cheaper, with a line price of 306 yuan. Delivery adds additional transportation costs. The street storefronts are also very chaotic, with a maximum of 16.6 yuan per load, which is cheaper than the fixed price.</p>
<h3>Cotton (3)</h3>
<p>- Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Initially, there were no machines for treading or bow spinning. Instead, the cotton was separated by hand, and the line strings and bamboo arcs were placed on the table and shaken into a paste, which was a very difficult task. In the early years of the dynasty, an old woman named Huang Daopo came from Yazhou and taught people how to make machines for carding, spinning, and weaving, as well as methods for mixing yarn colors, assembling threads, and padding flowers. As a result, the woven quilts, belts, and handkerchiefs had patterns of branches, phoenixes, chessboards, and characters, which were as clear as if they had been painted! People were taught and competed to make them, and then traded them to other counties. Families became prosperous. Not long after the old woman died, people were grateful and cried over wine, and they jointly offered sacrifices to her and built a shrine for her, which they enjoyed every year. Therefore, the Yuan Dynasty specially established the "Kapok Lifting Department" in the southern provinces of China to manage tax collection. When the Ming Taizu first established the country, he also ordered: "Civilians with 5 to 10 mu of land should plant half a mu each of soft mulberry and 'kapok'." This shows the country's emphasis on kapok, and it also shows that kapok has since spread to all parts of China, and it is no longer exclusively patented by the South, as Xie Fangde sang: "Good trees are planted with kapok, Heaven is so kind to Fujian." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Result of Japan's Invasion of China: Financial Situation Extremely Dire; Domestic Recession Prevents Absorption of Public Debt; Only Option is to Seek Help from Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, it has been nearly four years. It has consumed huge financial, material, and human resources, not only without any gains, but also with no way to quickly end the war. As a result, it is difficult to sustain it for long, and financial difficulties are the most serious problem. Therefore, most of Japan's military spending in China has had to rely on the issuance of public debt.</p>
<p>Severe Budget Deficit This Year</p>
<p>Due to a severe budget deficit this year, it is planned to issue a huge 1.5 billion yuan in public debt to make up for it. However, because the domestic people are affected by the recession, their ability to absorb public debt is weak. As a result, the results of the 22nd savings bond and the 8th patriotic bond sold by the Japan Hypothec Bank were very poor. The Japanese Ministry of Finance then decided to find ways to solicit money from Japanese people living overseas.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai to Vigorously Promote Sales</p>
<p>Therefore, the bank was entrusted by the National Savings Promotion Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and sent two of its employees, Kiyohiko Ozaki and Makoto Tanabu, to Shanghai. They, together with the Central China Finance Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, tried to persuade Japanese expatriates and Japanese merchants living in Shanghai and other parts of Central China to purchase the two bonds. The total amount issued this time was 100 million yuan, and it was stipulated that Japanese expatriates in Central China must subscribe to 1 million yuan. The bonds were issued in various Japanese commercial banks from June 14 to July 10.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Rights: Further Encroached; Airmail Transfers from Occupied Areas Handled by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>According to a notice from the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, airmail money orders from various bureaus in the occupied areas of Central and South China should be resumed from today. The verification of these money orders should be handed over to aircraft operating on various air routes run by the so-called China Aviation Co., Ltd. If these verification documents cannot be transported by air for the entire journey, they should be handed over to aircraft as much as possible in the middle to speed up the process. In addition to the normal money order fee and water replenishment fee, a national currency fee of 2.5 jiao will be charged for each airmail money order, regardless of the amount of the remittance. Other procedures will be handled in accordance with the airmail money order regulations, Director Zha Peilin.</p>
<p>Very High Remittance Fees: According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the designated locations for airmail money orders between Shanghai and Central and South China are Anqing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and five other locations. The remittance fees are very high. For example, for airmail money orders from Shanghai to Hankou, in addition to the normal money order fee of 1 fen per yuan, an additional water replenishment fee of 5 fen is added. The remittance fee to Hangzhou is the same. For Anqing, in addition to the normal money order fee of 1 fen per yuan, an additional water replenishment fee of 2 fen is added. For Guangzhou, in addition to the normal money order fee of 1 fen per yuan, an additional water replenishment fee of 1 fen is added. For Nanjing, in addition to the normal money order fee of half a fen, an additional water replenishment fee of half a fen is added.</p>
<p>Infringement of Postal Rights: It was found that the airmail money order fee for remittances between Shanghai and various free areas in China, such as Chongqing and Kunming, is only 1 li (i.e., 1/1000) per yuan. The airmail postage fee is only 1.5 jiao per piece (2.5 jiao for Central and South China). This is due to the increase in airmail postage fees by Japanese operators. Moreover, the establishment of airmail money orders in the occupied areas is still an innovation after the Shanghai war. Therefore, those who care about Shanghai's postal affairs are worried about the increasing encroachment on postal rights.</p>
<h3>Japanese Open Fire on Shotguns for No Reason, Injuring Four Female Workers</h3>
<p>Yangshupu in Eastern Shanghai is an area with many factories.

<h3>French Ambassador Gossmart Arrived in Shanghai by Plane Yesterday; Only a Few Days' Stay Before Leaving Elsewhere; The Talk of Replacing Someone Familiar with the Job Stopped</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China, Gossmart, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Peiping at around 4 p.m. yesterday, landed at the Great Airport, and then went to the French Consulate at 2 Kongguan Road in the French Concession by car. The Bund in the French Concession, from Aierduoya Road to Kongguan Road, had been under alert since 3 p.m. Except for motorcycles, all other vehicles and pedestrians were prohibited from passing through. A team each of the French Navy and Army, a team of Vietnamese soldiers, and a military band were stationed in front of the French Shipping Company. At 5 p.m., Gossmart and his entourage rode in three cars and arrived at the site. Accompanied by the commander of the French Navy and Army stationed in Shanghai, he reviewed them once. The French national anthem was played loudly, and the soldiers raised their guns to salute. After a while, Gossmart left in the original car. It was heard that Gossmart would only stay in Shanghai for a few days before leaving for somewhere else, but where he was going has not been announced. Recently, there has been talk of replacing the French Ambassador to China, but according to reliable sources, the French government has already abandoned this idea. Since Gossmart has been in office, his communication between the two countries has been smooth, and the French government is willing to retain Gossmart so that he can continue to be familiar with the job. Gossmart is nearly 50 years old. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, his entourage was very simple. He wore a gray felt hat and a gray suit. Although he had traveled a long distance, he was in good spirits. As for the rumors that Gossmart arrived in Shanghai on the French Shipping Company's Dada Nan yesterday, it is completely untrue. The company's staff formally denied this to reporters yesterday.</p>

Because he had been separated from key figures in the central government for a long time. He has been staying in Chongqing ever since, with many friends and relatives of the ambassador in Chongqing, and there are almost no empty days for meetings. It has been more than two months.

<h3>Peaceful Rice Arrives in the French Concession; Over 60,000 Bags; Rumors in the Market Yesterday that a Rice Ship Was Detained; Rice Weevils Tried to Cause Trouble Again but Failed</h3>
<p>According to the French Shipping Company, the company's Dada Nan arrived at the port at 12 p.m. yesterday and is currently docked at Gongchang Pier in Pudong to unload cargo. It is said that the ship carries 40,122 bags of mixed broken rice No. 412 and 24,980 bags of rice No. 2 Gong. It is said that the rice has been approved by the authorities of the French Concession and ordered by the Rice Import Committee, and will be sold in the city at the lowest price.</p>
<p>Calm People, No Price Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday in the rice market, after news spread that a certain ship carrying 1,000 tons of small-pattern rice by Dadou Foreign Company had been detained in Yangon, some rice weevils thought that they could take this opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, immediately after the market opened, they shouted high prices. Since the people were calm and no one was interested, all the rice weevils were disappointed and had to lower prices to release them. Therefore, yesterday's market price was still the same as the previous day, with no significant decline.</p>
<p>Yongchang Rice Store Resumes Sales</p>
<p>Yongchang Rice Store at 278 Datong Road was found to have mixed rice and its right to sell cheap rice was revoked after the Public Works Department and Qianxiangmao Foreign Company sent personnel to investigate and confirm. The rice store repeatedly requested but was not allowed. In addition, residents throughout the city are currently buying cheap small rice, so various types of rice are neglected. The owner of the store, Zhao Junsun, found it difficult to maintain business and personally went to the Cheap Rice Handling Agency to appeal and applied to the Public Works Department. The Bureau, in order to take into account the business operations, agreed to the request to observe the results.</p>
<h3>The Peiping Road Laborers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Peiping Road Material Storage laborers went on strike last Friday because the foreman was fired, and they demanded that the foreman be rehired. Yesterday, a representative was sent to start negotiations with Guan Chang of the Public Works Department at 10 a.m. yesterday (10th) to resolve the dispute. After the negotiations ended, the laborers announced their return to work. It was heard that the foreman was dismissed for failing to comply with the transfer order and may not be rehired. Rumors that the laborers from other material storage depots of the Public Works Department would also respond to the strike have not been confirmed. At the same time, the Peiping Road Storage Material work is still suspended.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Will Discuss Increasing Staff Salaries Today; Detailed Content Not Available Yesterday; It Is Said that the Total Salary Will Be Increased by 14%</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department will hold a regular meeting today (10th) and will make a decision on a further salary increase for all employees of the Bureau. The detailed content of the salary increase proposal is not available, and officials of the Public Works Department have refused to comment on this, only confirming that the salary increase issue will be decided today.</p>
<p>Considering a Salary Increase for Several Weeks</p>
<p>The Bureau has been considering a salary increase for all employees for several weeks. Reliable sources have reported that if the Bureau approves the salary increase proposal, the increase will be 14% of the base salary and cost-of-living allowance. Currently, the total cost-of-living allowance received by Public Works Department employees is 1.5 times the base salary. It is said that the Bureau has been considering gradually increasing this allowance to two times.</p>
<p>Or It Will Be Divided into Several Levels</p>
<p>Some people believe that the Bureau may decide today to only increase the allowance by about 12%. If the current situation does not improve, it will continue to increase by 12% to 13% later. Moreover, the Bureau's decision to increase salaries today will be divided into several levels, so that employees who are more affected by the high cost of living will receive more allowances. At the same time, reliable sources recently claimed that employees of the French Concession Bureau may receive a uniform salary increase starting next month. However, the French Bureau refused to disclose any information on this.</p>
<p>All Parties Pay Attention to the Increased Amount</p>
<p>According to the Zilin News, the proposal to increase the cost-of-living allowance for the Bureau's employees submitted by the Public Works Department's Personnel Committee is expected to be discussed at the Board of Directors meeting of the Public Works Department tomorrow (11th). It was found that the current cost-of-living allowance received by Public Works Department employees is 150% of the base salary. It is said that the increased amount recommended by the Personnel Committee after detailed research on the living conditions of Chinese and Western employees is less than 180%. All parties are paying close attention to this proposal, because the remuneration of employees in other industries in the city is now mostly determined by the income of Public Works Department employees. Some people are skeptical about the increase in salaries or allowances for Public Works Department employees.</p>
<p>It Will Inevitably Affect the General Price of Goods</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, after the Public Works Department announces a salary increase for employees, the prices of food and necessities in the city will inevitably rise accordingly, and the amount by which food and other prices rise will always exceed the amount by which Public Works Department employees' salaries or allowances increase. The first to suffer from the high cost of living will be the junior employees of many businesses, because the proportion of their increased income is not as much as that of Public Works Department employees.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Hospital Equipment Borrowed and Applied; No One Went to Remove It Yesterday; The French Police Have Sent Personnel to Check</h3>
<p>After the medical equipment of Shanghai Hospital at 172 Qiqi Road in the French Concession was moved out, a doctor from the hospital said yesterday that after Director Hai Jingge appealed to all parties for the borrowing of all necessary equipment, it has been roughly prepared, so the treatment work in the hospital can proceed as usual. No one went to remove it yesterday, but the French police still sent two Vietnamese police officers to guard the hospital yesterday. At 3 p.m., the Lujiiawan Police Station sent personnel to the hospital to meet with Director Hai Jingge to investigate in detail the types of items that were moved away.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Highway Passenger Tickets Increased</h3>
<p>According to information from the transportation industry, Zhejiang Province Highway Transportation Company has been increasing the prices of oil and various materials in recent years, and various costs have increased accordingly. In order to maintain transportation and inject funds, the company has appropriately increased passenger ticket prices for each road section, calculated at 2 jiao of national currency per kilometer. For example, from Jinhua to Lishui, the entire journey is 119 kilometers, so the fare is 23.8 yuan, to Longquan 27.4 yuan, and to Songyang 13.4 yuan. It is said that it has been reported for record and will be implemented on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Four President Ships Requisitioned; Only a Transfer in Nature; If Service Is Discontinued, Prepared to Dispatch Ships to Replace the Route; Far East Cargo Company Decided to Maintain</h3>
<p>The American Shipping Commission has requisitioned four ships of the American President Lines, including the Coolidge, Cleveland, Taft, and Pierce. The company has now confirmed this, but because the company has other ships that have not been requisitioned to join and supplement them, shipping has not been affected in the slightest. However, it may no longer carry passengers in the future and only transport cargo. However, this measure is only a possibility and there is no definite news yet.</p>
<p>Old Ships to Replace Requisitioned Four Ships</p>
<p>According to ship company sources, there is no confirmed news on when the Coolidge and other four ships will be requisitioned as auxiliary ships by the Department of the Army. However, the requisition of the four ships will not affect the voyages between the Pacific and the Far East, as the company's old Jackson and Mette President ships (transliterated) can be redeployed.</p>
<p>Requisitioned in Name Only, Still Sailing to the Far East</p>
<p>As for the Coolidge, Taft, Pierce, and Cleveland, although they have been requisitioned in name, they will still sail to the Far East in the future, or even come to Shanghai. The only change after being requisitioned is that their actions will no longer belong to the company but will be dispatched by the U.S. Department of the Army. According to company sources, the company has three other President ships that sail to the Atlantic Ocean and have long been allocated to the U.S. Department of the Army. Two of them, including the former Shanghai evacuation ship Montcalm and others.</p>
<p>Cleveland to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Cleveland President is one of the ships that has been requisitioned. The ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Manila, Hong Kong at 7 a.m. tomorrow and dock at buoys 12 and 13. In addition to a large number of mails, it also carries a large amount of cargo. It will be berthed in Shanghai for 16 hours and will set sail from Kobe, Honolulu, and San Francisco for the United States at 11 a.m. on the 13th. The last small passenger ship to pick up passengers will depart from the Xin Guan Pier at 9:30 a.m. on the 13th. The company has not confirmed whether the ship will be requisitioned on this trip. The Coolidge President is the company's largest mail ship, with a deadweight of over 22,000 tons. It is currently stranded in Manila and will return to Shanghai on the 18th of this month, stay overnight, and then return to the United States. In addition, the Adam President will join the world route and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on its maiden voyage on July 24.</p>
<h3>Another Labor-Management Conflict at the Mifeng Factory; Workers Injured</h3>
<p>The labor unrest at the Mifeng (Bee Trademark) Woolen Mill at 400 Poyang Road, which began last month, has continued to a stalemate to this day, nearing a month. Both labor and management have maintained a strong stance. Unfortunate incidents have continued to occur during the strike period. On the morning of the 4th of this month, the labor side once again negotiated with the management, but unfortunately, there was a wide divergence of opinions, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. As a result, several workers were beaten and injured. Subsequently, personnel from the Political Department of the Municipal Council were dispatched to mediate, and both sides showed mutual concessions. Currently, the labor side has sent six representatives to negotiate with the management within days to jointly find a solution.</p>

<h3>Premium Disappears, Instead of a Discount; Remittance System Succeeds; Many Legal Tender Depositors Apply for Remittance Transfers; Collateral is Reliable, Circulation Amount Increases</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Bankers Association implemented the new remittance system, various banks and firms have provided collateral to the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks to obtain new remittances. The total amount of new remittances is stipulated to be 50 million National Currency. The Foreign Banks Association of Shanghai, as well as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, have jointly formed a Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee to conduct monthly public inspections to ensure credibility. This new remittance fund with reliable collateral is gladly accepted by Chinese and foreign pawnbrokers and merchants, and has now been widely circulated in the Shanghai market.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Remittance Discounts</p>
<p>Remittance instruments are not allowed to be cashed or used to purchase foreign exchange, and are only allowed to be transferred between firms in Shanghai. Consequently, speculative money exchange shops exploited the fact that remittances could not be cashed to create a new practice of remittance discounts. Although the Ministry of Finance ordered a ban, it was ultimately due to Shanghai's unique background that the serious problem attracted public attention. It was also believed that in order to prevent capital flight, it was necessary to ban remittance discounts. For example, in July of the 28th year (1939), the highest discount was 280 yuan per thousand yuan. On May 2, of the 29th year, the discount was 220 yuan. The Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, entrusted by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank, attempted to stabilize remittance discounts, but due to various reasons, stopped the effort from July 1, of the 28th year.</p>
<p>New System Effective, Premium Eliminated</p>
<p>Since the new remittance system has been improved, with reliable collateral for remittance funds widely circulating in the Shanghai market, both Chinese and foreign holders of the bills have gradually gained considerable understanding of this new system. Remittance instruments are gradually being used in the same way as cash transfers, and remittance discounts have gradually decreased, disappearing without a trace and reaching par, a world apart from the previous need for a discount of 180 yuan per thousand yuan. Those who previously purchased and stored foreign exchange and foreign currency are now selling them and converting them into legal tender. At the same time, the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks has reduced interest rates and set limits for transfer account holders. However, the higher the amount of remittance circulation.</p>
<p>Collateral is Reliable, and Instead of a Discount, a Premium is Obtained</p>
<p>The new remittance has reliable collateral. According to the inspection report of the Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee, as of the end of April this year, the approved remittance amount for firms was 169,971,600 National Currency, and the total value of collateral deposited by various firms for interbank remittances was 46,777,893 National Currency, including 151,200 yuan in goods, 6,981,180 yuan in securities, and 39,545,513 yuan in real estate. The 23rd inspection is scheduled to be held on June 20. The credibility of remittance instruments is becoming increasingly strong, and a new phenomenon of remittance premiums has now emerged.</p>
<h3>Watchman's Gun Robbed</h3>
<p>A watchman (number 142) at 1243 Lane, Gordon Road, was on duty at the lane entrance at 9:40 last night when suddenly five thugs rushed to the watchman, threatened him with guns, and dragged him into the lane. They robbed him of his service pistol (gun number 221) and six bullets. The bandits fled in different directions without a trace.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Weather, Disease Epidemic, Plum Season Approaching</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been hot, with prolonged sunshine and no rain. The climate is arid and dry, which not only affects agricultural production but also harms the health of residents. Recently, infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, measles, and tuberculosis have been extremely rampant. Smallpox and scarlet fever have also been detected. Fortunately, there are no cholera cases. In total, 1,059 Chinese and 16 foreigners died in the Public Concession last week, and 275 Chinese and 3 foreigners died in the French Concession, totaling 1,334 Chinese and 19 foreigners, for a total of 1,353 deaths. From yesterday evening, drizzle has been falling and the wind is strong. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, yesterday's showers were a signal of the start of the plum season. The weather in the Yangtze River basin is turning overcast, and as far as the North China Plain and Tianjin, the sky is also hazy.</p>

<h3>Robbery on Beijing Road</h3>
<p>At 2:10 PM yesterday, four robbers broke into No. 23, Lane 316, Beijing Road. Two robbers took out guns and threatened the residents, robbing them of 5,500 legal tender yuan and a gold watch, and a radio. The robbers fled with the stolen goods without a trace.</p>
<h3>Stolen Funds from Post Office Robbery Not Yet Returned to Post Office; Six Suspects from Savings and Remittance Bureau Interrogated; Family Visits Rejected by Japanese</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Postal Administration robbery was solved, the Japanese side has not yet returned the recovered stolen funds to the Post Office for inventory. What is the intention? This has gradually caused anxiety. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the situation below:</p>
<p>Funds Not Returned</p>
<p>According to reliable sources at the Shanghai Postal Administration, although the major robbery of the bureau was quickly solved through the cooperation of the police and the Japanese military police, and the original stolen 2 million yuan (not 2.5 million) was recovered in full, the funds had not been returned to the post office for inventory as of last night.</p>
<p>Six People Not Released</p>
<p>However, the Japanese side has guaranteed that the funds are safe and it is believed that they can be returned by the Japanese side soon. Currently, Okada, the Chief Inspector of the Post Office, is handling the above-mentioned handover, not Kinji Kinichiro, as Kinji Kinichiro is on sick leave. As for the six Savings and Remittance Bureau employees, including Wang Xuchu, who were escorted with the funds, they have not been released.</p>
<p>Visits Refused</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the six people are being held at the old site of the Wing On Silver Company in Hongkou. Family members have asked the bureau to send clothes to the individuals several times, but have been refused by the Japanese side, who have also stated that they will be released soon. However, they are actually still being interrogated. Therefore, it is speculated at the Post Office that the failure to return the stolen funds is related to the interrogation of the six individuals.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Unpopular, Market Price Plunges</h3>
<p>After the market price of coal briquettes was illegally raised by various mechanized coal briquette factories, there was a public outcry. There was much external criticism, and there was a unified call for regulation. The authorities of the two concessions also sent personnel to various mechanized coal briquette factories to investigate the cost of manufacturing coal briquettes. According to news from various coal industry associations yesterday, coal briquettes are becoming increasingly difficult to sell, the market is flooded with inventory, and no one is asking about them. Coal merchants are unable to continue to operate actively, and the market is sluggish. Although the factory price is still maintained at 316 yuan per ton, the "black market" price has fallen sharply, from 316 yuan to 290 yuan per ton, and holders of the goods are still planning to lower prices to sell. Although warehouse receipts are still somewhat in demand, there is obviously no one asking about spot goods. 10,000 tons of coal fines are currently being transported to Shanghai and are expected to arrive around the 15th of this month. Most of the 10,000 tons of coal fines are coal dust, so the cost of manufacturing coal briquettes in the future will not only be free from a shortage of raw materials, but the cost will also be significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Special Tax Decided, Entertainment Venues Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, due to a shortage of administrative funds, issued notices to entertainment venues such as theaters and cinemas in late last month, stipulating that a special entertainment tax of 10% would be added from June. At that time, theaters and cinemas, due to rising prices, had huge expenses and it was difficult to maintain operations. If it were implemented, the theaters themselves would only increase ticket prices in order to maintain capital, which would indirectly increase the burden on the audience. Therefore, they jointly petitioned to maintain the status quo, but the result was still not approved by the authorities. In addition, the lower-level staff of the theaters have recently requested an increase in rice subsidies, resulting in an increase in the burden on the theaters themselves. As a last resort, the theaters have jointly raised prices starting today. Yesterday, the Xin Chan, Geng Xin, Da Wu Tai, and Gong Wu Tai jointly announced that, due to the Municipal Council's order to collect a 10% entertainment tax, and because of the high cost of goods and the sharp increase in wages, it is difficult to maintain operations at the original ticket prices. The theaters have decided to revise ticket prices uniformly starting June 11, in order to slightly increase revenue. The matter is unavoidable, and we hope for the understanding of all sectors. (It is understood that the price increase is about 20% on average.)</p>
<p>Cinemas Will Raise Prices in Stages</p>
<p>As for the cinemas, they have also received the same order from the authorities, and their request to maintain the status quo has not been successful. Seeing, in order to maintain their own interests, they have also decided to hold a meeting within days to discuss ways to increase ticket prices. However, the price difference between the first-run and third- and fourth-run cinemas is huge, so it is decided to raise prices in stages at that time. The business of entertainment venues after the price increase will inevitably be somewhat affected.</p>

<h3>The Immortal Painter Ma Mengrong</h3>
<p>The Da Xin Art Gallery is exhibiting Yongjia Ma's calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy for five days, starting today. The main works are the posthumous works of Mr. Mengrong. Mengrong and Gongyu were considered to be like the Ji brothers in Yongjia, and were renowned in the art world for their calligraphy, painting, epigraphy, poetry, and prose. Mengrong unfortunately passed away early, and I lost a good friend. Now, ten years have passed in a flash. The grief in the yellow spring, how can it be stopped? However, Mengrong's spirit lives on between heaven and earth, and his name will become more famous over time, which can be attested to. Mengrong has long been proficient in calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose. He has a particular talent for painting, and he has a deep family background and rich collections. He also has to visit gardens, travel through mountains and rivers, and observe the true phenomena of the universe every day. Whenever he sees strange birds and exotic flowers, he will immediately imitate them with his eyes and fingers, lean on his brush and meditate, and when he is satisfied, he will be overjoyed. Occasionally, he would encounter vendors hawking their goods on the roadside, and he would carefully observe all kinds of scales, vegetables, and so on, seeking the truth of their postures, drawing them in his diary, and then leave. His love for painting is like his life, and his skills are unique, not just relying on talent to browse through drawing manuals. Therefore, his paintings have integrated all the painting methods of ancient and modern times, and he can open up his own path. He is clear about the principles of the law, and his brush transcends the traces of phenomena. He is proficient in all styles, and his flowers, birds, insects, fish, and crabs are especially magical and unique. Works such as "Strange Fish Picture," "Strange Flower Picture," "Strange Bird Picture," and "Crab Not as Good as One Crab" have long been praised by people. Mengrong is not only good at painting, but also good at teaching, and has been a professor of Chinese painting in various universities for many years. Students who have been instructed by him feel that they have gained wonderful insights. Many of his students are famous artists. After Mengrong's death, President Cai Yuanpei sighed and said, "The loss of a great national painter is a small loss, but the loss of a great national painting educator is a great loss." This is indeed true. Now, the Da Xin Art Gallery is holding an exhibition of his posthumous works in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the death of this great artist, accompanied by recent works by Gongyu, Bihuang, Shiqian, and Jingjuan, with profound intentions. The art of China values being able to follow the ancient, and also values being able to create. However, this is not easy to talk about. Those who are not deeply immersed in the ancient, even if they want to create, cannot. Otherwise, it is just a wild fox zen. Mengrong has a very deep foundation in the ancient, and he can also innovate and create his own realm, not having the same face as others. How can he achieve this without the combination of heaven and man? There is no doubt that he is immortal. Generally speaking, people tend to be greedy for ease and fear difficulty, and imitate others for convenience. Therefore, when Deng Shiru came out, everyone in the world was Deng. When He Zizhen came out, no one was not He. There are many who copy others now, but if you want to be immortal, you must have your own creation. (Lang Jingshan)</p>

<h3>How to Study English (II)</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>However, to sum it up, regardless of the goal, near or far, big or small, whether studying at school or self-studying, to study English to a level where it can be applied, one must have a method. Brute force will not achieve the desired purpose, and one will only suffer losses. Carelessness may lead to discouragement or even failure.</p>
<p>What are the ways to study English? There are many. Like the saying in the martial arts world, "Everyone knows the trick, but each has their own unique skill." Those who have achieved some success each have their own insights and methods. I have wandered around and taken many detours on this path of study. Now, I would like to humbly share some of my small experiences in reading and teaching in this corner of the publication, as a gesture of offering a brick to attract jade.</p>
<p>This article intends to examine the three conditions for studying English and some small paths in reading, writing, speaking, and translating.</p>
<p>Three Conditions</p>
<p>First, I believe that studying English should start with setting a goal. With a goal, one can aim directly at it and move forward bravely. In this way, one can avoid detours. In other words, one can identify a straight path without branches and move straight ahead. A straight path can also be said to be a "shortcut." For example, some people only want to be able to cope with English in the future, some use it as a bridge to explore science, some prepare to embark on a literary path, some want to apply it to their profession, and some only regard it as a kind of academic cultivation. All of these are different goals, so it seems that one should take different paths in studying. Those who want to use it as a bridge to science do not need to pursue Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Second, after setting a goal and identifying a straight path, we need to measure this path and divide it into several sections. The first section is of course for basic English training. I believe that being able to complete Reading Book Three and Elementary English Composition, or textbooks of equal level, can be considered the end of basic training. Then, depending on our goal, we need to determine the path and set several more sections, completing them one by one. This does not conflict with our schoolwork and provides great assistance. Why divide it into sections? This is a scientific method. On the one hand, it can boost morale, and on the other hand, it can avoid the drawbacks of being greedy or intermittent. Each section has a corresponding time limit. Imagine how gratified we would be if we reached the specified section within the specified time limit. As for setting goals, it depends on the chosen profession. The issue of dividing the path into sections should be discussed with teachers or experienced individuals. The length of the time limit should preferably be somewhat flexible.</p>
<p>Third, English training methods can be roughly divided into two types. The one that is more commonly used in our country can be called the indirect method, which is the "textbook guidance" method. The other is the direct method, which also has textbooks, but the main focus is on live material training. These two methods each have their own advantages, but I personally believe that the direct method is lively and interesting, and highly efficient, because students are already experimenting and applying what they learn.</p>

<h3>The "Illnesses" of Women</h3>
<p>— Qishui</p>
<p>The magnificent seven-story building houses the clinic of a German-trained medical doctor on the third floor, room number three. The registration fee is ten dollars.</p>
<p>The clinic is quite exquisite, with four "suffering" ladies sitting inside.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hua is a famous socialite. She stood up immediately, and after a few words, she knew everyone: one was the concubine of the Jin mansion, the one sitting nicely was the second wife of the Qian comprador, and the plump one was the beloved mistress of Manager Zhang.</p>
<p>Bi: Mrs. Hua, being a socialite, spoke first:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Jin, what 'illness' are you suffering from?"</p>
<p>"Me?" Mrs. Yu sighed: "Alas... I often have 'stomach pain'."</p>
<p>"Oh, when did it start?" Mrs. Jin shook her head: "For many years... The master always wants me to accompany guests, eating and eating, always filling my stomach... Now I sometimes can't swallow even a grain of rice." Then she sighed again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hua sighed: "Strange illness... Hmm, what's bothering the comprador's wife?" Mrs. Qian touched her arms;</p>
<p>"It's so annoying, my arms are so sore, it hurts when I move."</p>
<p>"Then, how did it come about?" Mrs. Jin quickly asked.</p>
<p>"Well, probably from catching a cold: we play dozens of rounds of cards every night, often until dawn. There are always many partners, including several 'gentlemen', compradors, managers, chiefs, bank directors..."</p>
<p>At this moment, Manager Zhang's wife stamped her high heels:</p>
<p>"Damn it, my 'illness' is the worst... A debt-collecting illness, I've lost a lot of money, and there's no 'income' either..."</p>
<p>The three ladies couldn't help but lean closer.</p>
<p>"You don't know! My Mr. Zhang always gives me three to four thousand dollars a month, specifically for buying face powder. Of course, other things don't count... Naturally, I don't need to buy so much face powder, but it's too wasteful to leave it idle, so I have to 'make use of it'..."</p>
<p>Hearing Mrs. Zhang's reasonable explanation, the three nodded:</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." Manager Zhang's wife was very enthusiastic:</p>
<p>"So I thought: I'll hoard some goods, like daily necessities; and run some 'tables'; ha, I'm not bragging, I've been gambling big or small for years... Also, the Jai Alai field, the dog racing field... Can't forget those either... Alas, like this, you think, isn't it 'worrying', 'using your brain'?..."</p>
<p>The three ladies said in unison: "Worrying, worrying..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang suddenly slapped the sofa armrest with her hand: "The problem came, and afterwards I always felt dizzy and lightheaded..."</p>
<p>"Then, eat more tonics..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang frowned: "Oh, talking about tonics, don't even mention it, white fungus, ginseng, bird's nest, deer antler... Western things: vitamins, cod liver oil, preparations, enzymes, what haven't I eaten..."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hua, what about you?" Unfortunately,</p>
<p>She ran into Hua, the socialite, who also sighed: "Alas, the ladies are all 'lucky', how can I compare to my 'miserable life'..."</p>
<p>The three ladies were surprised: "Mrs. Hua, what do you mean?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hua sighed repeatedly: "Every night, I don't know how many 'parties' I have to 'dance' at, some nights I have the energy to stay up all night... You little know that if I'm not 'popular', every night is like 'glutinous rice balls', if I'm 'popular', great, the 'problem' comes, now my legs are always sore, but every night I have to 'buck up', dance, dance..."</p>
<p>The three ladies suddenly fell silent. Suddenly, Mrs. Jin squeaked: "Mrs. Hua, how did you become 'popular'?"</p>
<p>The socialite pouted, turned her head, and stomped hard on the sofa: "Go ask your 'gentlemen'!"</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>The nurse poked her head in like a rat: "Doctor X is here."</p>
<h3>Short Seven</h3>
<p>— Wang Pei</p>
<p>If you love life, you should cherish time, because time is the element that creates life.</p>
<p>Don't think you have a genius for intelligence. An intelligent person who is arrogant and considers themselves above all others is not as useful as a foolish person who pays attention to everything.</p>
<p>Anger has reasons, but none can have sufficient reason.</p>

<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>Moreover, several of them were notorious rogues in the village. Once they borrowed money, they wanted a second time, and after the second time, they wanted a third time. They simply would not stop until the person who lent them the money begged for mercy. Old Man Wu was anxious, and he repeatedly advised Qiu Haitang several times. But in less than half a year, more than five hundred dollars had gone down the drain.</p>
<p>"As long as you don't lend them money in the future, what are five or six hundred dollars?" After listening to his uncle's advice, he initially didn't mind at all, and instead smiled faintly.</p>
<p>But after a year, he couldn't help but start to worry.</p>
<p>First, the facts proved to him that the sentence "as long as you don't lend them money in the future" was absolutely impossible, at least for those few rogues. Once they almost fought with him at the village entrance. Second, he saw Mei Bao growing up day by day, with such a beautiful face and such intelligence. Even if she changed into the clothes of a village child, she still had a very noticeable difference compared to her brother's children. Qiu Haitang deeply felt that Mei should have her own future; in such a remote and poor place, her life would definitely be buried. For the sake of his daughter's happiness, he decided to find a suitable opportunity to move elsewhere and cultivate her well. In this way, he gradually felt that his savings were not enough.</p>
<p>In addition to the two fixed deposit books - six thousand yuan - that Yu Kun and Zhao Si brought back from Beijing, there was originally more than two thousand yuan in cash; but for moving, for buying things, for making friends with relatives, for repeatedly supplementing the household expenses in the past year or so due to insufficient expenses, for... the cash hidden in the bottom of the box was almost less than a thousand.</p>
<p>So he began to worry:</p>
<p>"Old man, you are also very bored here. Besides, I am already completely useless, and you will definitely not have a good life following me." (129)</p>
<h3>"Matchmaker" "Deceive" "Unlucky"</h3>
<p>— Gu Ying</p>
<p>It seems I heard people say that being a "matchmaker" is a "good deal"; when people live together in harmony for a hundred years, adding children and grandchildren, they take the matchmaker's money and eat the matchmaker's wine. This is a really convenient way to be a matchmaker.</p>
<p>Because of this, Old Lady Qian also became a matchmaker with great style.</p>
<p>However, there is a "trick" to being a matchmaker, and that is the word "deceive". Of course, Old Lady Qian is an "experienced" person, and she cannot escape this. She understands "nine out of ten matchmakers deceive", so she actually deceived the man's family and deceived the woman's family, accomplishing Old Lady Qian's match.</p>
<p>Old Lady Qian was full of joy and had nowhere to vent it, so she told everyone she met, boasting about her "skill as a matchmaker", but in fact, she was mostly happy to eat the matchmaker's wine and take the matchmaker's money.</p>
<p>She always believed that marriage based on parents' orders and matchmakers' words was the "right way", and she always looked down on other ways, no matter how they were described.</p>
<p>However, just a few weeks before the wedding, Old Lady Qian's "unluckiness" came.</p>
<p>The daughter of the woman's family was an only child, naturally the "apple of her eye". Originally, they were preparing to recruit a satisfactory son-in-law, but Old Lady Qian made a few turns and dispelled the idea of a golden turtle, but the "conditions" were also harsh. They wanted this and wanted that, and the gold and silver items they took over were either disliked for being too light or the style was too old; as for the banknotes, they wanted so much and so much, which made Old Lady Qian frown.</p>
<p>The groom of the man's family was her own nephew, so naturally she was familiar with everything in his family. Coincidentally, his mother was also a stubborn person, and she jumped up and said no, saying that raising a son was not afraid of not having a wife, and she was not looking for treasure! Ha, Old Lady Qian was stunned when she heard this! Haha, with such a conflict between the two families, she was afraid that she would not be able to "deceive" them. But Old Lady Qian couldn't let go of this "face", and the matchmaker had to eat eighteen meals", which meant running to the man's family and running to the woman's family, and it was not easy to count the ten or eight times of wasting time and causing trouble.</p>
<p>However, afterwards, Old Lady Qian became so "busy" that she began to complain, complaining that being a matchmaker was like "having bad luck".</p>
<p>It turned out that the young "couple" asked Old Lady Qian to introduce them to each other, to meet, to watch a movie, to walk in the park. Oh, Old Lady Qian thought this was extremely absurd. She remembered that when she left her "boudoir", she didn't dare to mention half a word about the road. So, based on this, she gave them a serious lesson, but unexpectedly, she, she actually raised a "protest", saying that she was over the "legal age" and could "independently" marry. This made Old Lady Qian feel confused. She guessed that the past and the present were just like this... Then, Old Lady Qian understood even less. He, she dared to directly cancel the marriage, thinking that without her consent, everything was invalid... Otherwise, she would not hesitate to hire a lawyer and publish it in the newspaper... How could Old Lady Qian not be annoyed? She never thought that the younger generation would also disobey her matchmaker, and even say that they would resolve it with the law, which was really "rebellious".</p>
<p>At the same time, the woman's family "inquired" that the groom was doing a "hopeless" job, earning less than ten "hands" a month... How could that be! It would be best for her daughter to marry someone with "style", who would ride in a car, live in a foreign house, and have a crowd of maids and elder sisters, so that she would not be wronged. Therefore, her daughter in her twenties was still not married, and that was for this point. It was okay to delay her daughter's youth, but if she "couldn't marry a good man in her whole life", wouldn't that "be a loss instead"!</p>
<p>So the woman's parents dragged Old Lady Qian and said, how could you deceive when you are a matchmaker! Old Lady Qian thought to herself that it was not good. She had just been displeased and was about to "break the engagement", what kind of dignity was that?</p>
<p>But Old Lady Qian still wanted to deceive them. She thought she would go to the man's family to take a walk, so to speak, to pull out the seedlings, but unexpectedly, the man's first sentence was also to break the engagement. It turned out that they had also inquired that the lady had been to the "mainland" and had extensive social contacts outside, and they didn't know how many boyfriends she had, so this marriage was by no means worthy, and they hurriedly asked Old Lady Qian to return the tea gift and betrothal money. Old Lady Qian thought that this statement was indeed quite reasonable, that the bride had originally "eloped" once and was often not at home, so it was better to deceive them with this match...</p>
<p>Alas, Old Lady Qian was "busy" for more than half a year, lying and deceiving for the sake of the match... but only got "unlucky".</p>
<h3>Is Dad Stingy?</h3>
<p>— Xinghua</p>
<p>My sister said: Dad is really stingy.</p>
<p>Because, she wanted Dad to buy hair oil. Dad said: Now everything is expensive, rice costs hundreds of dollars a stone! There's no extra money to buy hair oil, just use water to moisten your hair!</p>
<p>My brother also said: Dad is really stingy.</p>
<p>Because, he wanted Dad to buy a suit. Dad also said: Now prices are rising, rice costs hundreds of dollars a stone! There's no extra money to make a suit. Just wear a long gown!</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>The doctor said to my sister: "Your body is very weak, it's best to take more tonics, especially cod liver oil."</p>
<p>Dad went to the pharmacy and bought a gallon. He said, "This oil costs ten dollars a pound! For your health, I am willing to buy it. Eat as much as you like, and I will buy more when you finish it."</p>
<p>The school organized a winter clothing donation, and Dad was asked to donate money. Dad immediately pledged a donation. He said, "We should love everyone. Those who have strength should contribute their strength, and those who have money should contribute their money!"</p>
<p>Is Dad stingy? I asked.</p>

<h3>Notes After Watching New Domestic Films</h3>
<p>— Sudi</p>
<p>Here, I would like to sincerely and frankly introduce to the readers of the arts community the four new films I have recently seen, namely: Huguang's "The Beauty Trap", Xinguang's "Broken Heart Flower", Jincheng's "Red Tears in Iron Windows", and Guolian's "Jiangnan Little Swordsman".</p>
<p>Anyone who has read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" will probably remember the story of Liu Bei's marriage proposal, which turned out to be true. "The Beauty Trap" is based on this story. Wang Cilong directed and Wang Yuanlong starred. The two Wangs came together, and since they are brothers, this film can be called a "brotherly work". Regarding the allocation of actors, Wang Yuanlong played Zhao Yun, Lu Ming played Princess Shangxiang, Wang Naidong played Liu Bei, and Li Jingbo played Sun Quan. Except for replacing Hu Die with Lu Ming, this lineup is almost the original cast of "Peacock Flies Southeast". Wang Yuanlong's acting skills can be described as "handsome with surplus, but lacking expression". Every move seems "forced" and not "natural". Wang Naidong put on ancient costumes, with a strange head and strange face, and his appearance was ugly, and he still couldn't get rid of the style of modern clothes. Li Jingbo played well, and since he is a drama actor, his stage experience is naturally quite rich. Lu Ming's acting skills have made amazing progress, but unfortunately there are too few scenes, so it is not easy to please the audience.</p>
<p>"Broken Heart Flower" is a tragedy. According to the director Wang Yin, it is his most proud masterpiece of the year. The plot is very bitter and can indeed earn people's tears. [Name] is a "typical little girl" who shares the same fame as Zhou Xuan in the film industry. It is of course most appropriate for her to play a little maid in this play. Since "Xi Shi", this star has been separated from the audience for quite a long time. Her performance in this film reveals true emotions everywhere, which is really commendable. This should be due to "Wang Yin's good guidance". Liu Qiong plays a passionate young man who is full of courage. His acting skills seem to have improved a lot compared to before. Others such as Wang Xianzai, Han Langen, and Yin Xiucen are also competent.</p>
<p>"Red Tears in Iron Windows" is also a tragedy. Because there are many flashbacks in the script, there are many obstacles in the performance. Chen Yanyan plays Xiao Feng, and the role matches her, but unfortunately, she did not perform the sadness enough to be "touching". Mei Xi's expression has new progress. As for the section of Hong Jingling and Zhang Zhizhi's play, Wu Yonggang inserted realistic themes and handled them with a lively technique, writing about two hooligans who linger on the "dream of gold" when they are dying, scolding the current era, and even better, scolding the current parasites.</p>
<p>"Jiangnan Little Swordsman" is a martial arts film. There are not a few magical scenes in it, such as the Five Elements Divine Sword, riding the clouds and driving the fog, and flying sand and rocks. The story is about the battle between the Kunlun School and the Kongtong School, which is completely meaningless. Chen Juanjuan's sword dance performance is still worth watching. Juanjuan is quite capable of acting, but letting her play the "little swordsman" and play that kind of "boring" story is neither suitable for her personality nor can it develop her talent. This point is worthy of attention from those of us who are enthusiastic about promoting domestic films.</p>
<h3>The Silver Flower Record</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Western Cinema Association was formally announced on the 6th of this month, and eight committee members were elected on the spot. The Chinese committee members are Shi Tingpan of Huguang, Xia Lianliang of Xinguang, and Liu Zhonghao of Jincheng. The Western committee members are Bertolan of Asian Film Company, Sha'er of Guanglu, etc.</p>
<p>After "Silent Night", Hanhai, a newcomer from Guohua, will star in "Blood and Tears of Mandarin Ducks". It is also heard that the female lead of the film will still be the golden-voiced Zhou Xuan.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's mother suddenly took a turn for the worse, and yesterday she was transferred to Hongqiao Sanatorium for treatment. Chen's new film "Wild Rose" is eagerly awaiting its premiere at Huguang, so yesterday it continued filming. After "Ill-fated Flower", Guanghua Company's new work, "Mandarin Ducks of the Same Fate", shot its maiden shot yesterday, with the female lead still being Gu Lanjun. After Yu Ling's "Flowers Splashed with Tears", the new script has been named "Fallen Flowers", and once it is completed in Hong Kong, it will be sent to Shanghai and still filmed by Jin Xing. It is heard that the whole play still takes the life of a dancer as its theme.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin's new work after "Silver Spear Bandit" has been named "White Orchid". The female lead has been decided as Gu Lanjun, and the male lead will still be Zhang Huichong, but it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jin Xinmin, the manager of Minhua Company, hosted a banquet at the Jingu Hotel to thank the staff of "Children of the World" and invited reporters and all the staff and actors.</p>
<h3>Gu Lanjun's New Work After Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Baiding</p>
<p>Since Gu Lanjun starred in "Diao Chan" and established her foundation in the silver screen, her position has not wavered in the three years since then. This, of course, can be attributed to the conclusion in "The times create heroes." She is a brave, bold, and persevering new woman, and this can be fully confirmed from her life process of combining with Li Ying resolutely. After she combined with Li Yang, she gave birth to a child on the twelfth of last month, and now it has been exactly one month.</p>
<p>In the past month, she has been restoring her pre-natal healthy physique, so she is preparing to restart the work of this film. In addition to her and Li Ying's self-funded production of "Mandarin Ducks of the Same Fate", she will also star in Yue Feng's new work "Beauty Island" for Guolian.</p>
<p>"Beauty Island" is full of the tropical style of the South Pacific Islands, which is in line with her personality, and the male lead has also been internally decided to be Liu Qiong.</p>
<p>Brief News (1) Today (11th), Qin Ticket Jin Shaogang married Miss Jun at Lake Society, and there was also a hall meeting drama, and all the actors were famous tickets from the sea. The dramas were mostly Tan Pai's famous dramas. The groom personally played the piano, which was also interesting. (2) The sixth grand summer performance of the Green Field Theater Troupe is "Soul Returns to Hate Heaven", written and directed by Ge Ge. The location is planned to be at the Lyceum Theater.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Opera Figures</h3>
<p>— Written by Nanqiang Beidiao, Illustrations by Zhang Yuwo and Zhang</p>
<p>(12) Jiang Miaoxiang</p>
<p>Among the current male opera performers, besides those who have passed away, Cheng Jixian is the most prominent still active. However, Cheng Jixian rarely appears on stage due to his age and retirement. After Cheng, Jiang Miaoxiang is considered the most senior and respected. Jiang originally studied Qingyi (female roles), but switched to Xiaosheng (young male roles) after his voice changed. He is skilled in various roles such as Pheasant-Feathered General, Fan-Bearing Scholar, and Poor Scholar. Mei Lanfang values his talent and always includes Miaoxiang in his troupes. In historical dramas like "Dream of the Red Chamber," Miaoxiang always plays the role of Baoyu. He excels in plays such as "Gathering Heroes," where he plays Zhou Yu, "Thirteen Sisters," where he plays An Ji, "Flying Tiger Mountain," where he plays Li Cunxiao, and "Yue Family Village," where he plays Yue Yun. His reading of the indictment in "The Trial of Yutangchun" is particularly praised. Most modern performers tend to omit the "reading of the indictment." In recent years, due to his advanced age, his appearance is no longer as refined and elegant as it once was, and his gestures are not as graceful and romantic. He is also skilled in painting, with his peony paintings being the best. He often signs his paintings with "Hui Bo," which is Miaoxiang's courtesy name. He has a daughter who married Tan Fuying. The year before last, he married Feng Jinfu, the daughter of Feng Huilin, as his second wife. Huilin was Jiang's mentor, and Jinfu was a top student at the Beiping Opera School. Their marriage as mentor and student was a celebrated event. He possesses a scholarly air and resembles a Confucian scholar rather than an opera performer. (Next Saturday: Zhang Junqiu)</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Gongsun Sword Qi Begins (Part One)</p>
<p>The two walked and talked, descending Weifeng Mountain and arriving at the city gate. Soldiers were checking those entering the city at the gate. One of the soldiers recognized Xu Jing and immediately allowed him to enter. The two hurried to Wang Yongtai's house, where Wang Yongtai was already waiting. After greeting each other, they went to the study to sit down. Wang Yongtai then told them that He Ji's lewdness and immorality were unforgivable, and he had forced her to commit suicide by hanging. He also had Sang Yiqing buried alive in the backyard by his servants, ending this sinful relationship. He said, "This is their own doing, and you cannot blame me for being cruel. I cannot forgive them because of my Buddhist beliefs. Moreover, there will inevitably be a fierce battle here sooner or later, and I cannot avoid breaking my vows." After speaking, he sighed deeply. Xu Jing then asked if General Zhou was well last night. Wang Yongtai said, "Last night, I received a report from my family that the yamen had captured two assassins, one of whom died on the spot due to serious injuries. This morning, I escorted the assassin to the yamen to comfort General Zhou and briefly reported the matter of capturing the assassin at my house last night. General Zhou was very surprised and eager to meet Mr. Liu, instructing me to bring him to meet him when he entered the city. Therefore, I invite you two to have lunch at my house, and then I will lead Mr. Liu and my worthy nephew to pay respects to General Zhou." Liu Yinying said, "I am a rustic person living in the mountains and have not had the opportunity to meet high officials. Therefore, I dare not visit General Zhou. Please, old hero, make excuses for me." Wang Yongtai said, "Mr. Liu, please do not be so polite. With your outstanding appearance, graceful manners, and elegant conversation, you are truly a contemporary talent, no less than my worthy nephew Xu. General Zhou repeatedly instructed me to introduce you to him. No matter what, I cannot allow you to leave. General Zhou would laugh at my incompetence for not being able to keep even one person. Moreover, General Zhou is eager for talented individuals and treats people with respect. He will surely be pleased to meet you. If you refuse to go, you will truly be disrespecting me." Xu Jing also persuaded him. Liu Yinying reluctantly agreed to a meeting. Thus, Wang Yongtai prepared a feast for the two, with many delicacies. Xu Jing was very happy and toasted Wang Yongtai several times. Liu Yinying only drank half a cup, taking only a small sip, and refused to drink more.</p>

<h3>(2) Greta Garbo</h3>
<p>This immortal and mysterious lady is now changing her past style. When she was fifteen, she worked in an apartment. Then her father died suddenly and she became a model in a hat store to earn a living. One day, a progressive Swedish director discovered her, gave her a supporting role, and told her to change her cumbersome name. Her first starring film was The Atonement of Gösta Berling, which won the Nobel Prize. At the age of sixteen, she left her hometown of Sweden for the United States to make films for MGM. She is five feet six inches tall with golden hair and sapphire-like eyes.</p>
