<p>重慶　鄂北日軍之總退却、與晋南日軍之放棄黃河各渡口、引起此間人士之紛紛推測、茲傳大批日軍集中晉鄂區域、使人深信日軍或圖渡過黃河、以進攻西安與漢中、惟最近華方軍報、暗示目前日軍在晋鄂之行動、或只　於　付扼守中條及大洪兩山華軍之局部戰事、昨日日機百餘架、曾六次轟炸洛陽、投下五百餘彈、幾毀全城四分之一、謠傳日傘兵昨日曾在洛陽降、殊屬無稽、至於日軍之猛轟洛陽、是否為企圖在洛陽附近渡過黃河之前奏、或為企圖阻止華方接濟品、由洛陽運抵晋南黃河、彼岸之華軍、則尚不可知、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　官方戰事公報頃稱、鄂北戰事、近又發生、因日軍於星期四晨、藉火砲飛機之掩護、又復進攻　　非　未能逐退華軍、反於星期五為華軍包圍、該公報續稱、浙江之華軍、向餘杭·吳興及富陽等日軍根據地襲擊、頗著成效、華軍曾於五月十四日、攻入杭州以西十二英里之餘杭、毀壞倉庫兵舍等軍事設備七十處後、當日即退出、同日另一隊華軍、曾攻入太湖以南之吳興、擊斃日駐軍無數、而於日援軍抵達前即退、該公報又稱、同時華軍並襲擊杭州西南之富陽、該戰事公報又稱、星期四日軍數度自諸暨進攻、而被擊退、華軍於五月十六日克復福州東北之重要城市連江、斃日軍五百、並克復福州附近三座山嶺、中央日報認日軍五月份在四處前綫所施之攻勢、係圖使美蘇英三國發生一新感覺、而打擊其助華之心理、（十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　中央日報評述中日之軍事局勢云、自蘇日中立協定締結以後、日軍即加緊其在華之軍事行動、日軍自四月十六日為始、以兩個師團在浙閩沿海登陸、四月底時、日方集第三十五、三十六、三十七及四十一師團、與第三獨立旅團、共約十萬人、於山西、於五月七日分六路進攻扼守中條山之華軍、同時日又集中第三、四、十二、三十九師團及第十八獨立旅團、共十萬人、於　山、隨梁·京山·鍾祥·荊門·當陽及宜昌等處、於五月六日分八路進攻扼守棗陽區域大洪山之華軍、日軍在粵省方面、曾於五月十日以第十八及三十八兩師團進攻東江之惠陽、華軍在浙閩海岸方面、曾於四月二十五日開始反攻、克復台州·黃巖·溫州及海門·等處、日軍現守寗波·諸暨·及錫州·鄂北之華軍曾於五月十日開始反攻、予對方以重創、日軍已退回進攻前之原來陣地、粵省方面日軍於五月十二日攻佔惠陽後、華軍即由西北反攻、向東移動、並於十　日將花果克復、日方所謂之五月攻勢已在各地崩潰、惟有晋省方面華軍、因衆寡懸殊、放棄黃河渡河、並折向日軍後方作大規模之游擊戰、是以日軍雖已到達黃河各渡口、但不敢　移渡河、同時華軍已在沿黃河南岸一帶集中大軍、以待發展、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<h3>渝否認　華軍入緬</h3>
<p>重慶　中國軍事發言人頃否認華軍計劃入緬甸或已與該處英軍聯合之訊、此項否認、係因日方曾傳華軍七千人已入緬甸、以增强該地之英駐軍而威脇泰國、在過去兩月前、日方曾傳播同樣之消息、該發言人並否認中英締有軍事同盟之訊、按可靠之英人士、最近亦向合衆社作同樣之否認、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>軍委會發表　一週間作戰概况　九日至十五日</h3>
<p>重慶　軍委會發表、本週（九日至十五日）戰況、相當緊張、茲將各綫戰況略述如下、</p>
<p>晋南豫北　邊境日軍企圖（肅清）中條山中之華軍、以穩固其黃河北岸之地盤、於是分三路同時於七日午後一時發動、大舉會犯垣曲、東路由溫縣·沁陽經孟縣·濟源西犯封門口、　路由翼城·張馬·及絳縣、樟嶺　等地向南逕犯垣曲、西路由夏縣及張茅大道、犯台柴村、華軍對此、嚴陣以待、分途迎擊、東路被阻於封門口、西路被阻於台柴村、北路由張馬南侵之一股、又被阻於董鎭講迄百花村之綫、惟沿橫　大道　犯之一股、被衝入垣曲、但董封一帶之華軍、依然與日膠着在業山峻嶺間、日（肅清）目的、始終未達、頃據報、沿黃河此岸各口之日、已一律北撤、</p>
<p>鄂境　日軍為（肅清）大洪山之華軍、同時策　晋南作戰、（一）先期集結萬餘之衆於應山、於五日分股向北進犯、一股於八日進至棗林店、一股攻入淨明舖、一股攻陷隨陽店、華軍以日已進入華有利地區、各路即展開猛烈反攻、繞至日後部隊、同時亦到　夾擊、至九日午、先後攻克棗林店·隨陽店·吳山店等據點、斃日三千餘、日南退環潭鎮、現正加緊圍殲中、（二）日軍為策應應山日軍在大洪山北作戰起見、又在襄河兩岸發動數路小規模攻勢、（甲）鍾祥·洋梓等地日軍糾集七千餘、於八日進犯仙居山、流水溝等地、至九日晚、被華驅回、現對峙於豐樂河及長壽店以東地區、（乙）由荊門北犯日軍八千餘、於九日晚進至仙居、劉侯集迄李家壋之綫、經華奮力圍殺、並向日兩面夾攻、激戰至十一晨、斃日幾達二千、現華各　已追達鹽池廟以南一帶、（丙）當陽附近日軍三千餘、於七日分股向遠安進犯、當即為華驅回、日傷亡甚衆、現已恢復原態勢、</p>
<p>浙東　諸暨日軍、經華軍連日進攻、死傷甚衆、日大量增援、分股反攻、其東南犯橫山市及南犯坑西村豐江周等股各二千餘、均被華阻擊於原地、惟由草塔市南犯王沙溪市之一股、被其進抵傳宅市、但現已被華軍阻住、</p>
<p>粤東　（一）增城東莞等地日軍萬餘、於九日開始由水陸分別東犯、經華軍在博羅等地阻擊、死傷甚衆、至十一晨、日復大舉增援、華以戰略關係、遂於午後退出博羅及惠陽城、現華日仍在惠陽城郊激戰、（二）廣州東北神罔日軍三千餘、分向獅前市、大窩朗、風雲嶺、白田罔進犯、現已被華擊退、另一股由龍翔北犯、曾被一度攻入縣城內、經華　烈反攻、又將花縣城完全克復、（十七日電）</p>
<h3>美作家海明威冒險赴前綫</h3>
<p>香港　　蔑西報今日　版刋載美名作家海明威、在廣東前綫時之冒險成績、　稱、海明威在韶關時某夜曾隨中國部隊進入廣州、華軍於是夜將日本軍事建築若干所破壞、彼等一行分乗沙船一艘、乘夜向下游進駛、在廣州近郊登陸、完成破壞工作、於拂曉前安然引去、　傳此次之冒險、給予海明威以深刻之印象、證明各　所　淪陷城市內之日軍夜間常撤至安全地以避免中國游擊隊之進擊　節、確屬事實云、（十六日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰再擴大的前夕</h3>
<p>巴爾幹戰事於上月杪告一段落之後，希特勒又照例發動那種目光四射的政治攻勢，以準備决一步的軍事行動—這攻勢的對象至少包括蘇土法西四國。在政治佈置尙未妥貼之前，他決小冒昧從事，此所以伊拉克戰事雖已爆發，却不見他的積極參加；照常理講，不問伊政府已吾正式乞援，英伊衝突正是納粹乘機東進的絕好機會，但希特勒寗可『坐視不救』，却先忙於進行他的政治外交攻勢，可見他雖是侵略魔王，倒也深知運用穩紮穩打的明訓，這是他的狡猾處，也正是他勝過其他侵略者的高明處：茲請就這幾天德國在再度擴大戰事前的對外活動，一加檢討。</p>
<p>先言對蘇關係，無論外傳德蘇瓜分近東之說如何熾烈，在納粹兵力瀰漫整個巴爾幹，且已逼近蘇聯門戶的今日，德蘇合作之局似乎已到了飽和點，希特勒目前的對蘇態度，除非別有用心，似乎祇須求莫斯科政府的嚴守中立，旣不必以過高的代價，換取蘇聯的參戰，以致予史丹林以分潤戰爭利益的機會，更不需立即侵犯蘇聯，以多樹一敵，換句話說，目前似乎祗須虛與委蛇，以實力迫使莫斯科置身事外，於事已足。</p>
<p>至於對土關係，觀乎巴本大使的滿口親善和忙於提供保證，料想希特勒眼前的計劃，祇在切實拆散英土兩國的同盟關係，使土耳其投入軸心，一方增加自已的威望，一方打擊英國的聲勢、從而便利他在近柬和北菲的行動：惟其如此、他爲使安加拉政府較易「上鈎」計，一時殆未必提出爲土國所不能接受的要求：質言之，希特勒祇須要求土國放棄對英同盟。加入自已的陣綫。此外更不必—至少在目前—提出假道一類的要求，以免投鼠忌器，再蹈南斯拉夫起而反抗的覆轍。</p>
<p>關於西班牙，德國所希望的。無非是迫弗朗哥加入軸心，以助攻直布羅陀：但不論其爲便於壓迫或壓迫而求其易於收效起見，均有先使法蘭西就範之必要，因爲一則壓迫戰敗的維希，較易奏功，二則法國入彀之後，西班牙當然更難堅拒，因此，這幾天。德國的政治攻勢雖同時有幾個對象，却無疑地，首先集中於維希一處。觀於最近法德經濟交通協定的成立，以及達爾朗之赴德會晤希特勒，可知法德合作之局面，確已相當成熟：截至目下爲止，僅知德國已允修正自由區和淪陷區的界綫，並减少駐軍供應費的數額，關於維希所付出的代價如何，法德雙方均諱莫如深，唯一見諸事實的，乃是德國飛機的「假道」叙利亞，然則至低限度，叙利亞之被用作東進階梯必已列入合作條件之內。</p>
<p>貝當政府伺以一向尙能拒絕德方的苛求，而今决竟接受合作？欲解答此一問題，似乎又須稱道希特勒避重就輕，因時制宜的政治手腕：原來過去德國向維希要求的是求出艦隊和地中海兩岸的港口，這是法蘭西帝國的生死問題，貝當政府當然不惜以再度抗戰的決心加以拒絕；時至今日，希特勒一方已知道此事不可操之過急，一方則更因時過境遷，眼前正放着一個束進的難得機會，於是樂得暫時「降格以求」，僅僅提出一些不牽涉法國所謂「生存利益」的要求，以博取維希的合作，例如利用叙利亞以打通一條援伊捷徑，或者正是維希所比較容易接受的條件之一。世人皆知叙利亞之爲德國東進跳板，正和越南之爲日本南進跳板，一般無二，維希過去什越南問題上旣能對日讓步，今日在叙利亞問題上，當然更可對德屈服，何况德國還有减低駐軍供應費和修正界綫的相當代價，似乎更易誘致貝當軟化。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，可見希特勒此度的政治攻勢，至少就對法而言，已有相當的成就，或者他竟憑藉這一點成就，馬上發動近東戰事，預料今後數日內便可揭曉；至若就法國立塲而論，則天下事有利必有弊，對德妥協雖可便去冬賴伐爾去職以還的緊張局勢，暫見緩和，但相反地，却必然使英法關係乃至美法關係趨於惡化，英機的轟炸叙利亞，和羅斯福總統不滿法國的言論，便是此一轉變的徵兆：假定英法兩國果眞弄到兵戎相見，使昔日的盟友變成自相殘殺的敵國，則不備將爲歐戰第二年的最不幸事變，更是人類莫大的悲劇，興念及此，不得不希望法國現當局不耍因爲一時的小利，貽誤了久遠的國運。</p>
<h3>日將開五會議　討論對華政策　印報謂日攻勢不足慮</h3>

<p>諾克斯後對獎國海陸軍專校畢業班致詞謂、世界必須防止今後數十年復有一希特勒之發現、吾人必須維持增進人類幸福的權利、雖須在防衛戰爭中銷費吾人物質、亦當無所顧慮、俾維持此權利、美國在承平時代亦猶在戰爭時代、有維持强大海軍之必要、因武裝之解除、德國遂於希特勒秉政六年後膽敢向全世界挑戰、吾人敢謂德國在歐失敗後、如世界又復放棄其警權則不出二三十年、當有第二希特勒繼起為害、歷史屢有自信能統治全世界之在人、如凱撤·成吉斯汗·拿破侖·希特勒是、而在每一在人失敗之後、世人之自欺者、輒以後無來者為慰、要知其不然也、故服役海軍者、應各負責任、殫其平生精力、務使今後海軍不復蹈自美國革命以還每决戰爭後輒自削减之覆轍、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　倫敦大火記</h3>
<p>那時紅光滿天，我們兩人却知道這一夜是倫敦的大火之夜，且火勢似乎有增無减。因此馬格利提議沿着堤岸去一觀究竟。</p>
<p>到了泰晤士河邊，只見此河已成一條紅色帶子，除了一般正在焚燒的駁船有黃色的火焰，父有兩處，大的是堆棧倉庫，也有深黃色的火熖發射而外，只見一片紅色，與天際紅光相映。但是火勢最烈之處，顯然是在河的這岸。</p>
<p>出差汽車，一輛也看不見，除了警察和防空員外，大多數平民都口跑空。突然間我們四周的眼線，都有東西在跳動着。起初我當是榴霰彈後來見每一彈片，都爆成貓兒大小的火球，發出水銀蒸氣燈的綠色，纔知道是燒夷彈。有兩枚正落在離我們不足三碼的地方，在街上邊亂跳。我們看見防空員跑來把火撲滅，還聽見屋頂瞭望員的呼援。</p>
<p>這些燒夷彈都落在我們近旁，在人行道上焚燒，絲毫沒有傷害，却把馬格利的怒火升了起來。我翹首回顧，恰好見她用力一脚，把一枚燒夷彈踢入溝中。此彈正落在人行道的玻璃櫥窗附近，玻璃都已起泡融化了。我只見馬格利一隻脚用手提起，一隻脚跳着走路，忙把她的鞋子脫下。鞋底巳經燒穿，幸而襪底僅被燒焦。她說足底或者不免要起泡，但無論如何，總是很値得的。</p>
<p>我們穿過一條街，跑到一家銀行，在銀行四周堆着許多沙袋，以保護人民的存款。我們一共搬了六袋，把袋中的東西傾倒在四面燃燒的燒夷彈上。袋中倒出來的却不是沙而是灰，可是滅火的功效倒也不下于沙，</p>
<p>街道兩邊都有屋頂起火，先是屋簷上面冒出濃烟，然後橙黃色的火光，在頂層窗戶中穿出。因為這一帶是敦倫的商業金融區，大部份房屋都空無人居，屋頂瞭望員也很少，所以下面的防空員祇有看見火光之後，纔知道那裏起火。這時候我忽然想起一年以前在柏林的見聞。有一决在外交部招待新聞記者席上，一個國社黨新聞記者向我們大言不慚的說，倫敦雖大，德國可隨時把牠所有的船塢碼頭及其他建築付之一炬。這話一向置之腦後，直到現在纔想起來了。</p>
<p>因此，馬格利便說那事或許是實在的，這火或不限于局部，而勢成燎原，有竟夜不熄的光景。我却說不管這樣，現在總是就餐最適宜的時候吧。</p>
<p>近處除薩伏亞餐館之外，所有的店舖都已關門。薩伏亞是倫敦最高貴的飯店，又是最安全的防空處所，餐廳中的食客都是衣冠楚楚，還有許多穿着制服，他們的面部都平靜得如在慕尼克會議時一般。只要你一出薩伏亞之門，就會覺得英國人民的勇敢，有禮和忍耐，不知不覺的會喜歡英國人，馬格利和我都有此同時。</p>
<p>餐後跑到街上，見那橙黃色的火光更亮了，鄰近雖沒有火，但是半英里以外的火光，却被幾千呎高的烟霧反映出來。德成正繞着濃烟的叫周，忽聞緩緩的嘯聲，逐漸加高，知道是一顆大炸彈落下來了，在我們前面有幾個來到倫敦休假的兵士正在穿過十字路口，聽得炸彈落下時的嘯聲，便立刻仆伏于地，恰好躺在十字路口的中央，這是他們訓練成的習慣，不知道這是錯誤的舉動，因為十字路口，彈片可從四面飛來，倒不如逃入屋內。幸而炸彈落下的地方，至少在二百碼以外，所以沒有發生意外。</p>
<p>突然之間，我們看見一輛出差汽車，從火光熊熊的方向沿街駛來。我們向他招呼，車子便停住了。那車夫形色倉惶，東張西望，兩耳閃動，車子被澆得全身是水。他似乎驚魂未定，聽得我們要他載到起火之處，便說他無論如何，決不再回到那裏去了，他說全城都巳起火，無法控制，今夜勢將燒成瓦礫塲，他正要跑出城外。馬格利說，她不要這樣驚懷的人同行，所以我們便步行前去。</p>

<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨猶屬寥落、貨主仍在堅持、巿吼尙無變化、但後洋米再度猛跌、中段貨跌近百元、影響所及、作客大都停辦、貨主無法可施、售心立鬆、一時跌風亦起、頃刻瀉落五六元不等、計結果厚粳價除無錫淸特粳尙開百卅五元、崑山白粳巳祇百卅二三元至百卅元、南港早晚稻僅百廿七兀、中關原包亦祇百卅一二元至百廿八元、糯米當此環境跟踪直下、且去路微細、允覺乏神、計開香港白元百〇八九元、並跌五六元之巨、</p>
<h3>麵粉江河日下　—有比平賣粉為廉者—</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、跌風愈盛、因受米價慘跌影響、及棧租增加等消息、重重壓迫、人心疲莫能興、本客實銷、更見冷落、業內外囤戶及浮多、一致貶脫、故市面江河日下、金龍牌坎粉跌進二十九元大關、後市僅開二十八元五六角、尙乏整批受主、砲臺粉亦祇開二十九元一角至二十九元、反比平賣粉價格為廉、比上日又小一元以上、其跌勢亦可謂猛烈矣、</p>
<p>小麥市况、愈趨呆頓、蓋以巿塲供求早寂、偶有餘剩之陳麥、大都直接配廠、其價格亦屬每况愈下、目下各粉廠對於原料均已停辦、均待新麥上市、再行收買云、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅補空復昂</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市面、在上午依然疲頹之態、故各種交易寥若晨星、苞米會續跌二元外、期貨豆餅挫二三角、至午後開盤、仍然如故、但入後因受謠言刺激、空頭心怯、致期餅抵補、先行頻繁、苞米亦繼之拉抬、行情復昂、期餅允屬挺秀、結果比上日市猛升五六角、現貨銷塲尙屬平凡、計開甡記現餅一千片、價為十八元六角、期餅五萬餘片、訂五月二十號交價為二十元零二角、五月下至六月上交價自二十元零四角半、跌至零二角、復一再猛升至二十一元、其他成交源記現餅一千片、價為十八元、肥字現餅一車、價為十八元五角、苞米雖復砌、但較上日巿仍小元外、共成交三千五六百包云、</p>
<h3>經濟雜談　馮柳堂　銀行（一）</h3>
<p>中國商業中稱營業之大奢，嘗曰行；行之名稱，唐代已有之。及與歐西通商，與洋人交易之所曰洋行。在乾嘉之際，似乎所謂洋商也者，為洋行商人之通稱，不限定於洋人；而以夷商乃為專指洋人而言，此則留待將來關於中國商業名稱（如行·號·店·舖·廠·局·莊·棧·作·坊·園·塲·館·社·公司·之類）需要論述時再談。因稱洋人營業所曰洋行，今其所出納營業者為銀，不若中國之錢號錢莊錢行之用錢，乃名其行曰銀行，此即銀行名詞之由來也。</p>
<p>大約最先使用此銀行Bank名飼者，為英商麥加利銀行。麥加利銀行原名TheChartered　Bank　ofIndia，Australia　&amp;China設於杳港者，即稱為渣打銀行，渣打者，即Chartered之譯音。而Chartered為特許之意，謂其為英皇家所特許之銀行也。然則何以上海之行又稱為麥加利，此則以人得名。蓋當時來滬設立分行之洋經理，據傳名麥加利，滬人與所交往者但知為麥加利，遂亦以麥加利呼其行，相沿成習，麥加利銀行乃成為固右之名詞矣。</p>
<p>麥加利銀行開辦於西曆一八五三年，即咸豐三年，總行設於倫敦，距上海開闢為租界，不及十年。時英人正挾其戰勝之威，欲厚植其勢力於中國。咸豐七年（西曆一八五七年），復有英法聯軍入廣州，虜粵督葉名琛以去，而麥加利銀行來滬開辦，即在是年，故迄今　（一九四一年）固巳八十五年矣。</p>
<p>時歐洲諸國之逐鹿於遠東者，為英法俄三國。一八五九年（咸豐九年）法人既占領西買·一八六二年（同治元年）越南又割交趾支那與法。其在中國。為英法聯軍入北京，兩决天津和約以後。法人至是為推廣其經濟勢力於中國起見，乃亦來滬設立法蘭西銀行，的在同治三年（西曆一八六四年），即今北京路外灘東方滙理銀行之地址也。第一仟之洋經理為哈加森，華經理則為宋書升。宋通拉丁及法蘭西語文，忠誠幹練，故任華經理終其身，及光緒二十年，（西曆一八九四年）宋去世不久，而華俄道勝銀行開辦，遂盤受法蘭西銀行之基業。</p>
<p>亞於法蘭西銀行而在滬設立分行者，則為滙豐銀行，Hongkong　&amp;　Shanghai　Banking　Corporation開辦於同洽三年（西曆一八六四年）。其初本為英，美，德，華，波斯商人合資組織，其後不滿於英人之所為，美德波斯股份相繼退出，遂成為英商銀行。復於同治六年（一八六七年）來滬設分行。雖與麥加利俱為商業銀行，然觀其英文名稱，固一望知其為英人發展遠東殖民地事業之銀行也</p>
<p>當光緒甲午（一八九四年）中日戰役之後，中國人憬悟於國力不充實，頗思從開發實業以求自强，路礦借款，允為當時朝野所注目。光緒廿二年，張之洞王文韶請設鐵路總公司，並保盛宣懷為督辦。時盛為天津海關道，至是以四品京堂候補，督辦鐵路總公司事務。盛即條陳（一）行徵兵制；（二）裁厘加稅，將關稅加至百分之十；（三）發行印花稅；（四）開辦銀行，抵制洋銀行；（五）在北京設立銀元總局，鑄八五成色之一兩銀圓。當時戶部議復，飭盛宣懷籌辦中國銀行，招股五百萬兩。俟銀行辦成以後，准其附鑄一兩重銀元，以十萬元為率，先在南省試行，如果可以流通，毫無阻礙，再行妥擬章程辦理。此即中國通商銀行開辦之由來也。</p>
<p>光緒二十四年五月，大理寺少卿盛實懷奏陳籌辦中國通商銀行次第開投情形云：</p>
<p>「中國銀行，節經招集紳商，備定股本，參照西國銀行章程，自光緒二十三年（按為西曆一八九八年）四月二十六日，開辦上海總行。自夏徂冬，天津，漢口，廣州，汕頭，烟合，鎭江等處分行，陸續開設。京城銀行，上年亦巳開辦。至各行省都會，亦當逐漸分設。近年金鎊翔貴，銀幣壓低，如上海通商總滙之區，而銀根空乏，商情岌岌，皆有不可終日之危。幸通商銀行主持市面，銀息雖昂，猶有限制，得以勉為支住。中國銀行規模草創，故裨補於商務者必由漸而來。並由仿辦於各國銀行在華開設之後，如滙豐之設巳三十餘年，根底已深，不特洋商款項往來，網羅都盡，即華商大宗貿易，亦與西行相交日久，信之素深。中國銀行新造之局，勢力未充，非可驟與西人爭勝。故原議以愼始圖終，積小為大為宗旨；今創辦一年，始甚巳立，自此擴充中土之商利，收回自有之利權，其樞機必視京外撥解官款，是吾皆歸通商銀行為旋轉。若各省關存解官款，仍循舊轍，專交私家之銀號，絕不與奉旨設立之銀行相涉，則商政之體全失，西人畿笑，華人增疑，孰肯信嚮，所關於通商大局非小。合為仰懇飭下戶部通行各省關，嗣後凡存解官款，但係有中國通商銀行之處，務須統交銀行收存滙解，以符事體。」</p>

<p>香港申匯下降</p>

<h3>紗花　雙馬有軋空象市價逐盤上進</h3>
<p>紗市父復回昂、但趨勢飄忽無常、此因實際交易殊滯、港幫僅有粗紗交易、二十支紗需要甚淸、所以證劵幫及金子幫大都傾向拋出、如斯一來、一般大戶之多頭、非但不放、反來拖進加碼、探其意態、謂廠單缺乏、拋空更無棧單交解、大有軋空模樣、因之塲中氣勢稍緊、市盤即向上升矣、如果反之、則速下墜、目前就大勢而論、巿面不能大漲、然內慕做作亦難斷定也、根本問題、實需太滯、二十支雙馬高價為一千四百八十四元、低價一千四白六十五元、午後因週末而無巿、有人說一千四百八十七兀、有人要進、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市態平凡、首盤價為一千四百七十元、少頃跌至一千四百六十五元、旋以金僭平平、檯面上伸手者買進、徐徐上升至一千四百七十五元、但現紗銷塲不暢、叉鬆至一千四百六十五元、時近十二時左右、有一部份大空頭復來抵補、塲中風勢忽緊、市盤逐步上進、漲至一千四百八十四元收盤、查半日間成交統計九千六百四十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一四五同行九、五〇〇統計九、六八四五</p>
<h3>棉布平凡</h3>
<p>現棉情况父屬平凡、此因廠胃不開、華廠因雜牌紗價低廉百元外、對於高價原料、心思允澹、至於外廠大部份自巳直運、無需向花號購買、所以人心雖好、成交不旺也、印辛特二〇〇·五號家三〇〇件棧交另訊、洋行棉交易、市况頗屬活潑而堅定、但因執貨者居奇、　不願輕易脫售、同時廠方亦　局勢不靖、紗市徘徊而無購意、故成交之數、仍屬寥寥無規</p>
<p>紐約棉布、先因同業買進、及華盛頓政治消息、羅期福總統將批准貸款協定而漲、續後叉因一部分獲利了結略跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日的漲七八磅音、</p>
<p>又電、去年八月一日起、至今年五月十六日止、美棉統紀錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>印度棉巿、先因棉商售出而跌、但續後又因空頭抵補活躍、及買方奮力支持而回漲、昨日收盤價格除白洛去叫五月份跌七羅比外、其餘各漲二至八羅比不等、</p>

<h3>煤炭　赫陵白煤屑漲後回跌</h3>
<p>赫陵白煤屑、月前因貨方有意關住、致市上現貨籌碼頓見缺乏、同業行拆、暗盤曾抬至兩百四十餘兀、乃趁高拋售、略有流出、買方亦以來源甚湧、觀望不前、故仃淸漲後回跌、昨開煤屑每噸二百三十元、棧房自出、行槓外加、聞較前週巳回落靠廿元行情、</p>

<h3>炸車案迭有發生　日竟擬架電綱　自蘇州迤東起長達五哩　日兵沿綫駐防無濟於事</h3>
<p>前日炸車案共傾覆十四節之多</p>
<p>滬寗綫蘇州附近前（十六日）晨四時發生兩週內之第二次火車被炸案、各情已誌昨報、茲悉日陸軍現擬在蘇州迤東沿路路架電綱、長達五哩、</p>
<p>出事地點　在滸野關</p>
<p>據從寗抵滬之旅客談稱、此次爆炸、發生於蘇州以西之小站滸墅關、駛滬之運貨火車一列被炸、機頭與貨車十四節、均吿出軌、諒係游擊隊在路軌間埋一地雷、致吿爆炸、</p>
<p>大起重機　吊取覆車</p>
<p>直至前日午後一時、淸除路軌、尚未竣事、午後乘車由寗來滬之旅客、至爆炸地不得不下車、沿軌步行哩許、復登待於彼端之火車始抵上海、旅客謂彼等見裝於平底車上之大起重機、方圖吊起傾覆之火車上軌、</p>
<p>炸車案件　層出不窮</p>

<h3>怎樣敬重我們的師長？</h3>
<p>— 斜霞</p>
<p>一個人最親愛的當然是父母，而其决便是師長了。因為父母子女之愛大半出於天性，而師生之愛大都是出於感情的。師長每天在敎堂中很熱心的敎導我們，那我們就應該很用心去聽才是，倘使不用心去聽，那師長一定要覺得不開心的。</p>
<p>旣然師長是這樣的熱心敎導我們，那我們也得要敬重他才是，但是用什麼方法去敬重他呢？現在我們在這些年齡的時候，談不到報答這件事，我們應有以下幾點實行：</p>
<p>（一）我們在平時對師長要有禮貌。</p>
<p>（二）在師長講解的時候應細心去聽着，不要使他失望。</p>
<p>（三）師長叫我們怎樣做，那我們就得服從，因為師長根本不曾叫我們做壤的事情。</p>
<p>以上幾點，我們都能够做到的，一方面可算是敬重師長，也可說是報答師長咧！</p>
<h3>小事也要注意</h3>
<p>— 志如</p>
<p>一個廣大的工塲上，有許多人在工作，那是在造一船，船的大體巳造好了。忽然，他們發現一條大木上有一隻蛀蟲，那只有半英寸長。「這塊木頭巳有蛀蟲了，我們可要放在裏邊嗎？」我們想也許可以的，那是不會被別別人看見的。」另一部分的工人以為這小蛀蟲也沒有什麼了不得。所以大家就毫不在意的放下去。雖然，有三四個人就說蛀蟲要越蛀越大的，可是沒有人理會。終於把這塊蛀壞些許的木塊放了下去，而造好了這隻船。</p>
<p>在昔樂悠揚聲中，這船下水了。十年來在海上行駛得很平安，可是十一年的開始，也就是不堅固的開始：那塊有蛀蟲的木條幾乎蛀完了，這船就漸漸的不行了。</p>
<p>當船主在船艙中發現了這件事，很擔心。默默的求上帝，保佑這船平安到岸。因為這船裏載着許多的人民和貴重的絲。</p>
<p>海面上竟起了一陣極厲害的暴風雨，這船在風雨中飄搖，漸漸的傾側，船裏有了一個大缺口，滔滔的海水一陣陣的湧入；雖然有二架巨大的抽水機，大家用力地抽着。但是水仍不住的冲進來。</p>
<p>救生艇來不及放，船中已充滿了水。一刹那間，在暴的波浪巳把它吞了下去，只有散木片和屍首在海上飄流。是的，貴重的絲也沒有了，人的生命更不用說了。</p>
<p>是風雨和波浪害了那些貨品和人們嗎？不。是船上的人們不團結不努力而害了自己嗎？也不。只是那工塲的工人大意，造船時把蛀的木頭放入，才闖下了大禍。</p>
<p>所以，我們隨時要注意小事情，小事情也要特別的注意！</p>
<p>？的意義　一經</p>
<p>「？」，是一種表示疑問的符號。當我們在書籍中和他相逢時，他老是很謙虛地站在每句的後面，好像只是一員無名小卒，沒有多少價値。其實這位「？」先生的價値，却是有我們所想不出的偉大呢！為什麼？因為「？」是思想的起點，也是宇宙間萬物演進的原動力。一個人自從母胎中出來起，直到死為止，最親近的導師，要算這「？」先生了。他可與你提出疑難，得到豐富的經騐，學識。在古時道位「？」先生也非常之忙，他激動了牛頓的心，使牛頓在一個小小蘋果上，發現那地心吸力的大定理；他又激動了愛迪生的心，使我們現在有那樣光亮的電燈及一切電流之物。「？」先生，他還是繼續不斷地一步一步引導世界文明前進，進到光明的地帶。他的力量是多大呀！所以我們不看輕他，相反地，並且還要努力詢問這「？」先生，追求探討才好。（侈酬作貸學金）</p>
<h3>睡醒的原因</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>在清晨，街上的行人還不很多，許多小朋友，三五成羣的往學校裏去了。小朋友，你們為什麼起身這麼早？你們的回答，當然是為了不願上課遲到。可是，我再問一句，你們晚上睡了為什麼這樣早的醒了？是誰喚醒你們的？我想，這問題的同答便不會一樣，有的說是媽媽喚醒的，有的說沒有人喚自巳醒來的。這一個回答，我以為說是自己醒來而沒有人喚是不大對的。可是，我相信一定有不少的小朋友要和我辯論，說是確確實實沒有人來喚，是自己醒來的。好小朋友！在右邊的一張圖案中你能知道它一共有多少圈嗎？吧，我來說說睡醒的原因吧！</p>
<p>為什麼我們要睡覺？為的是我們工作了一天，身體的各部分都疲憊得很，要使身體得釗一個相當的休息而恢復過來，於是，我們便人睡了。小朋友，你們覺得嗎？如果有一天你們在賽球，你們過分的奔跑了，晚上覺便覺得特別的好睡，這就是要恢復了你巳經十分疲憊了的身體的緣故。你們睡覺，睡了一夜，疲乏的身體巳經復原了，這時候你們就要醒來了。然而，這時候是有人來喚你的。比方，太陽的光，從窗子裏照進來，使你的身體感覺到和黑夜有些小同——當然，你的疲憊尙未復原是不會感覺到的。還有窗外小烏的叫聲，你們的媽很早起來在整理屋子裏一切東西的聲音，再有，天氣的冷和熱，以及普在你身上的被單的厚和薄，這都使你在睡足的時候促你醒來的外西，所以，這些東西，都是在早晨來喚醒你的東西。</p>
<p>我這樣一說，小朋友，你們大家都明白了，早晨是有人來喚醒你的了。</p>
<h3>圖案謎</h3>
<p>— 毅軍作</p>
<p>小朋友！在右邊的一張圖案中你能知道它一共有多少圈嗎？</p>
<h3>寓言三則</h3>
<p>— 震雲</p>
<p>（一）貓和雄雞：一頭貓捉到了一隻雄雞，想找個理由來吃掉它。於是它便駡雄雞道：「你這壞東西，一淸早就高聲叫喊，吵醒了人們甜蜜的睡夢，所以我今天要吃掉你，為人們除害。」維雞自辯着說：「我辛苦的在淸晨叫喊，因為要喚起一般人們早起工作啊！」但是貓的回答是：「即使你有更多更充實的理由，但是我總不能不拿你當點心的。</p>
<p>（二）預言家：一個預言家坐在路旁替人算命，忽然有一個人很急促地來報吿他（指預言家）家裏的東西被賊偷光了。預言家便長嘆了一聲，趕快跑回家去。他的隣人對他說：「你這傢伙，你能够預百到人的禍福，怎麼偏不會斜得到自己的事呢？」</p>
<p>（三）救命：有一個小孩在橋上走，一失足跌到河裏去了，一點點的往下面沉，幾乎要淹溺了，恰巧這時有個男子走過，小孩便向那男子求救，那裏料到那男子却從容不迫地站在橋上駡那孩子不當心。那孩子叫道：「先生，請您先救了我的命，然後冉駡我也來得及呢。」</p>
<h3>幾種似是而非的東西</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>乘一個星期日父親有空在家的機會。阿慧剛吃畢了晚飯那個時候，爸爸正安閒地躺在沙發裏在養神，媽媽在做着弟弟的單鞋，哥哥正在整理書包，妹妹正要削鉛筆來預備功課，在這一間屋中完全籠罩在靜的氣氛中。忽然不知怎的，他把這寂靜的空氣擊破了，吵着他父親在今天晚上無論如何要講一隻故事給他聽。正坐得很出神的父親被他打擾得眞不耐煩，又得搜索枯腸來找尋故事的資料，可是船是要尋，愈是想不出牛句話來。他父親這時正看見阿慧的妹妹在削鉛筆，更從「鉛筆」兩個字轉着了念頭，一忽兒在腦海中轉了一個灣，便開口間阿慕：「鉛筆是什麼東西做的？」</p>
<p>「鉛筆當然是木頭和一叚細鉛併合而成，不然怎麼會叫做鉛筆的呢？」阿慧心想他父氣怎麼會變得這樣的笨而竟問出這樣幼稚的問題來，然而他那裏知道反顯出他自己的愚笨了。</p>
<p>「不錯，我就是要你回答這樣，可是你不知道你的答覆却是錯了。這鉛筆心是由鉛製成的，不但要弄錯，就是一般人也是很容易纏錯的。我今天所以要提出這個問題來問你，就是希望你把這誤認的心理從此改正。要知道鉛筆的鉛心，並不是鉛製而是石裂製成的，不過完全用石墨做鉛筆心，又嫌它太軟，所以有時要在石墨中攙些陶士或蜜臘，而使它變硬，陶土攙得愈多，鉛心愈便。所以在每一枝鉛筆桿上刻着英文字母「H」及」B，」如「H」字母數愈多，鉛心的硬度也愈大，如「B」字母數愈多，那鉛心愈軟，而「H」「B」兩字母連在一起，則軟便適中，我們普通所用的大都是「H」「B，」幸虧鉛筆心是石墨做的，不然有一般人握着鉛筆寫起字來，往往要把筆頭在舌頭上一舐，這樣可使寫的字深一些，要是那筆心是鉛做的話，那說不定會發生有人中鉛筆的鉛毒而死的怪聞，因為鉛確是一種很毒的中西，所以鉛筆應當改稱為石墨筆，是妥當得多，不過說起來不大方便罷了。</p>
<p>其决想到自來水筆，這一個名字也不大適宜，有人誤會筆裏貯藏的墨水能取之不竭，用之不盡，自然而然會源源而沐的。事實上不是這樣，筆中的墨水也有用完的一天，應當稱為墨水筆。再想到火車和汽車，也互相弄錯了。事實上火車是用煤把水鍋中的水煮沸，而使成水蒸汽，然後利用蒸汽來推動車輪，那應當稱做汽車最是適當。而汽車在事實上不是利用蒸汽來使車行動，而是當汽油變成氣體由于電的火花而使氣體和空氣的混合物爆發，因爆發而膨脹壓着車輪的活塞，可使車行動，所以汽車行動完全是靠電的火花，所以應當叫做火車。還有做鉛桶的馬口鐵，俗名叫做「洋鉛皮」，其實不是鉛做的，而且根本和鉛毫無關係。這是一張鐵皮，為要防止它鐵銹起見，在兩面塗上了一層鋅，這樣又美觀又不生銹，所以這「洋鉛皮」的名稱是叫別的，應當叫做「鋅鐵皮」是最確切的了。」</p>

<h3>“自由中國”的婦女劇藝運動</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>喚起民眾自覺收效宏大</p>
<p>在大後方的“自由中國”，一般婦女，對於劇藝運動，非常熱心。一切的一切，是孤島人士所不知道的。因此，筆者要根據一個外報記者所寫的，譯述一些，為本刊讀者作一報道。</p>
<p>婦女劇團　一般在“自由中國”的少女，組織了劇團，時常在市場的附近，因陋就簡，搭了舞台，衹要有了看客，馬上就可演起戲劇來。所演的劇本，大半以中國作戰軍士的英勇故事，和其他不良份子為題材。雖然多數簡短，但也可使看客喝彩，叫好，為之大笑或流淚，感人之深，也可想見。有時那些劇團，跟了軍隊，上演戲劇，以解軍人的寂寞。她們從這一村到那一村，由這一省到那一省，足跡所至，已很遼遠。有一個婦女劇團，在一年之中，曾走過五百哩路，上演同樣的一個劇本。電影明星“中國嘉寶”陳波兒，自上海發生戰事後，就離開拍片的影片公司，加入西北劇團，在後方演劇。後來，這劇團於一九三九年四月，在河北境風被日軍捕去，從此就沒有聽見過消息。</p>
<p>女子歌詠團，除了戲劇，好多女子組織了歌詠團體，在後方歌唱。用最後勝利，全國統一，大好河山等題材，四出歌唱，以喚起農民的自覺。　有時軍人在掘壕或築路，她們便去歌唱，以提起他們的精神，而加緊工作。同時，去慰勞出發到前線去的軍人。有時到鄉村中去，教老婦人與小孩子歌唱，活動得也相當厲害。</p>
<p>女子卡通書團　一般女畫家，組織了團體，忙著繪卡通畫。卡通畫，和戲劇與歌唱一樣的使民眾受到鼓勵刺激。在白紙上，在墻壁上，以及在山岩上，都成了繪卡通畫的地方。好多女畫家們，時常背了畫具，到各處去繪卡通畫。題材方面，也多採用出征軍人的英勇故事，和不良份子的醜惡。所以醒目的卡通畫，由諸女人的手筆著，在“自由中國”，也到處可見。這些女人，大半是藝術學校的畢業生。</p>
<h3>“洪宣嬌”將搬上銀幕</h3>

<p>中旅劇團最後在蘭心及卡西登大戲院連續公演之歷史名劇“洪宣嬌”，自上演以來，瞬已一月，因該劇演出奇佳，故深　多數觀眾所排戴，致迄今賣卒始終不衰，因此引起藝影界當局之重視，最近　活之美成影片公司，即盛迎擬將戲劇搬上銀幕，惟結果因向中戲劇團當局洽淡演員問題，而未能解決，致一底盛傳有打消攝製之說，　最近消息傳來，因美成負責人顏鶴鳴吳邦藩，始終不願甘自放棄由優良之劇本，故最近已與該團負責人唐槐秋專行談判，放經一度商討後，業已獲得圓滿結果，已決將該劇搬上銀幕，除仍由唐若青充任主角外，所有配角，亦決定有中旅劇團原班人馬協助演出，導演仍由費穆擔任。</p>
<p>該片預計之攝製費為七萬五千元，演員之酬勞亦已決定為一萬八千元，而唐若青唐槐秋父女之酬金，竟達一萬元之多，其餘之八千元，則由全體配角分派，每員亦可行三四百元，故該牌酬勞之厚，在目前國產影片中，已屬罕見，惟美成書局所顧慮最人之一點，即為主角唐若青在平時舞台上之嗓子甚啞，如將來在銀幕上發音之聲，亦屬同樣，則對賣座勢必有所影響，故公司會要求在該片攝制前，對主角唐若青應有膠長時間之休養。再美成負責人曾發表，以後該公司攝製之方針，將大部採取舞台上優良之劇本作為華繩，故中旅劇團仃將十演之“西太後”一居，公司當局　　考慮攝製中。</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Retake Lianjiang County and Continue Advancing; Zhejiang Troops Storm Yuhang City; Over 600 Japanese Soldiers Killed in Lianjiang; Japanese Warehouses and Barracks in Yuhang Destroyed</h3>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: (1) Chinese troops on the north bank of the Min River launched a fierce attack all day, capturing Shangshan and Xiasan (both northwest of Lianjiang) at 3:00 AM on the 16th. Continuing their advance towards the city walls, they killed over 600 Japanese soldiers by 1:00 PM, causing the Japanese to collapse and retreat. Chinese forces are now in complete control of Lianjiang City, clearing the spoils of war and pursuing the retreating Japanese. (2) In the Fuzhou area, Chinese troops launched a counterattack on multiple fronts, making rapid progress. By the morning of the 16th, they had advanced to Daling, Xiaoshan, Centou (all north of Fuzhou), Lishan, and other areas. The Japanese were showing signs of collapse. All Chinese units are now cooperating to inflict a fierce blow on the Japanese. (3) On the north bank of the Qian River, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on multiple fronts on the 14th. One route captured Fuyang before dawn, while another route stormed Yuhang City at 10:00 AM. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements arrived from Xianlinbu but were defeated, suffering heavy casualties. The Chinese burned over 70 Japanese warehouses and barracks before withdrawing. Simultaneously, another route briefly entered Wuxing City, capturing many enemy soldiers. (4) Over 1,000 Japanese soldiers attempted to invade Nanmalukou in Pengze from the south, but were repelled by Chinese forces at 5:00 AM on the 14th. They reinforced with another 1,000 troops in the afternoon, retreating to Shimen by the morning of the 15th. Chinese forces are currently putting up a strong defense. Japanese forces invading from Huangtuling via Huangtugang, Xiaojialing, and Yuanjiayan were met with fierce resistance from Chinese troops. Fighting continued until 2:00 AM on the 16th, resulting in heavy Japanese casualties and a retreat to the north. Xiaojialing and Yuanjiayan were immediately retaken by Chinese forces. (5) Japanese troops who had advanced to Xingjiangji, Dashugang, Suiyangdian, and other areas on the 14th, launched a combined fierce attack on ZaoYang City on the morning of the 15th, accompanied by over a dozen Japanese aircraft bombing the city. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 16th, the city was captured by the Japanese. Chinese forces are currently surrounding the Japanese troops, inflicting heavy casualties. (6) A contingent of Japanese troops invading from Yuanqu in the west was intercepted near Houjiashan by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The general retreat of Japanese forces in northern Hubei and the abandonment of various crossings on the Yellow River by Japanese forces in southern Shanxi have sparked speculation among people here. It is rumored that a large number of Japanese troops are concentrating in the Shanxi-Hubei region, leading people to believe that the Japanese may attempt to cross the Yellow River to attack Xi'an and Hanzhong. However, recent Chinese military reports suggest that the current actions of Japanese troops in Shanxi and Hubei may only be aimed at local battles to contain the Chinese forces guarding Zhongtiao Mountain and Dahong Mountain. Yesterday, over a hundred Japanese aircraft bombed Luoyang six times, dropping over 500 bombs, destroying nearly a quarter of the entire city. Rumors that Japanese paratroopers landed in Luoyang yesterday are completely unfounded. As for whether the heavy bombing of Luoyang by Japanese forces is a prelude to attempting to cross the Yellow River near Luoyang or an attempt to prevent the Chinese from transporting supplies from Luoyang to the Chinese forces on the other side of the Yellow River in southern Shanxi, it is still unknown. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Official war communiques have recently stated that battles in northern Hubei have resumed because Japanese troops launched another attack on Thursday morning, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, but failed to dislodge the Chinese forces, and were instead surrounded by Chinese forces on Friday. The communique continued to say that Chinese troops in Zhejiang launched successful attacks on Japanese bases in Yuhang, Wuxing, and Fuyang. Chinese troops captured Yuhang, twelve miles west of Hangzhou, on May 14th, destroying seventy military facilities such as warehouses and barracks, and then withdrew on the same day. On the same day, another Chinese unit captured Wuxing, south of Taihu Lake, killing countless Japanese troops stationed there, and withdrew before Japanese reinforcements arrived. The communique also stated that Chinese troops simultaneously attacked Fuyang, southwest of Hangzhou. The war communique further stated that Japanese troops launched several attacks from Zhuji on Thursday but were repelled. Chinese troops retook Lianjiang, an important city northeast of Fuzhou, on May 16th, killing 500 Japanese soldiers, and retook three mountain ridges near Fuzhou. The Central Daily News believes that the Japanese offensive launched on four fronts in May is intended to create a new impression among the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and to undermine their support for China. (Associated Press Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News commented on the military situation between China and Japan, saying that since the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, Japanese troops have intensified their military operations in China. Since April 16th, Japanese troops landed on the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian with two divisions. By the end of April, the Japanese side gathered the 35th, 36th, 37th, and 41st Divisions, and the 3rd Independent Brigade, totaling approximately 100,000 men, in Shanxi. On May 7th, they launched a six-pronged attack on the Chinese forces guarding Zhongtiao Mountain. At the same time, the Japanese concentrated the 3rd, 4th, 12th, and 39th Divisions, and the 18th Independent Brigade, totaling 100,000 men, in Ying Mountain, Suiliang, Jingshan, Zhongxiang, Jingmen, Dangyang, and Yichang, and launched an eight-pronged attack on the Chinese forces guarding Dahong Mountain in the ZaoYang area on May 6th. In Guangdong Province, the Japanese launched an attack on Huiyang in the East River on May 10th with the 18th and 38th Divisions. On the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, Chinese troops began a counteroffensive on April 25th, retaking Taizhou, Huangyan, Wenzhou, and Haimen, etc. Japanese troops are now defending Ningbo, Zhuji, and Xizhou. Chinese troops in northern Hubei began a counteroffensive on May 10th, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Japanese troops have retreated to their original positions before the offensive. In Guangdong Province, after Japanese troops captured Huiyang on May 12th, Chinese troops launched a counteroffensive from the northwest, moving east, and retook Huaguo on the 10th. The Japanese so-called "May Offensive" has collapsed everywhere. However, in Shanxi Province, the Chinese forces, due to their numerical inferiority, abandoned crossing the Yellow River and retreated to the rear of the Japanese army to conduct large-scale guerrilla warfare. Therefore, although the Japanese troops have reached various crossings of the Yellow River, they do not dare to cross the river. At the same time, Chinese forces have concentrated a large army along the south bank of the Yellow River to await developments. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed sources here have received unconfirmed reports that as a result of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, four Japanese divisions have been transferred from Manchuria to mainland China. The report also stated that the Japanese troops will launch attacks on Chongqing and Kunming from both Central China and Vietnam. (Associated Press Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Denies Chinese Troops Entering Burma</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman recently denied reports that Chinese troops planned to enter Burma or had joined British forces there. This denial was made because the Japanese side had claimed that 7,000 Chinese troops had entered Burma to reinforce the British garrison there and threaten Thailand. The Japanese side had spread similar reports two months ago. The spokesman also denied reports of a Sino-British military alliance. Reliable British sources have recently made similar denials to the Associated Press. (Associated Press Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases Summary of Operations for the Week of May 9th to May 15th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Military Affairs Commission released a summary of the war situation for the week of May 9th to May 15th, which was quite tense. A brief summary of the war situation on each front is as follows:</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi and Northern Henan: Japanese troops on the border attempted to (eliminate) the Chinese forces in Zhongtiao Mountain in order to consolidate their foothold on the north bank of the Yellow River. They launched a large-scale offensive in three routes simultaneously at 1:00 PM on the 7th, converging on Yuanqu. The eastern route advanced west from Wenxian and Qinyang via Mengxian and Jiyuan to Fengmenkou. The central route advanced south from Yicheng, Zhangma, and Jiangxian, Zhangling and other places, directly attacking Yuanqu. The western route advanced from Xiaxian and Zhangmao Avenue, attacking Taichaicun. The Chinese forces were on high alert, repelling the enemy on all routes. The eastern route was blocked at Fengmenkou, the western route was blocked at Taichaicun, and a unit of the northern route that invaded from Zhangma was also blocked on the line from Dongzhenjiang to Baihuacun. However, a unit that invaded along the Henggou Avenue was able to enter Yuanqu, but the Chinese forces in the Dongfeng area remained engaged with the Japanese in the Yieshan Mountains. The Japanese objective of (eliminating) the Chinese forces was never achieved. It has recently been reported that the Japanese along all the crossings on this side of the Yellow River have all retreated north.</p>
<p>Hubei Province: Japanese troops launched operations in southern Shanxi at the same time as (eliminating) the Chinese forces in Dahong Mountain. (1) They first gathered over 10,000 troops in Yingshan and launched an offensive to the north in several routes on the 5th. One unit advanced to Zaolin Dian on the 8th, one unit captured Jingmingpu, and one unit captured Suiyangdian. The Chinese forces, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese had entered areas favorable to the Chinese, launched a fierce counteroffensive on all routes, encircling the Japanese rear. At noon on the 9th, they successively captured strongholds such as Zaolin Dian, Suiyangdian, and Wushan Dian, killing over 3,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese retreated south to Huantan Town, and are currently being encircled and annihilated. (2) In order to coordinate the Japanese operations in Yingshan against the northern Dahong Mountain, the Japanese launched several small-scale offensives on both banks of the Xiang River. (A) Over 7,000 Japanese troops from Zhongxiang and Yangzi and other places attacked Xianju Mountain, Liushuigou, and other places on the 8th. By the evening of the 9th, they were driven back by the Chinese forces and are currently in a standoff in the area east of Fengle River and Changshou Dian. (B) Over 8,000 Japanese troops invading from the north of Jingmen advanced to the line from Xianju, Liuhouji to Lijia Dang on the evening of the 9th. After fierce encirclement and annihilation by the Chinese forces, and a two-sided attack on the Japanese, nearly 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed by the morning of the 11th. The Chinese forces have now reached the area south of Yanchimiao. (C) Over 3,000 Japanese troops near Dangyang launched an offensive towards Yuanan on the 7th in several routes, and were immediately driven back by the Chinese forces. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and have now returned to their original positions.</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang: Japanese troops in Zhuji have suffered heavy casualties after days of attacks by Chinese forces. The Japanese have sent a large number of reinforcements and launched a counteroffensive in several routes. The two units of over 2,000 troops each that invaded southeast of Hengshan City and south of Kengxi Village and Fengjiang Zhou were blocked by the Chinese forces in place. Only one unit that invaded south from Caota City was able to advance to Chuanzhai City, but it has now been stopped by the Chinese forces.</p>
<p>Eastern Guangdong: (1) Over 10,000 Japanese troops from Zengcheng and Dongguan and other places launched an offensive to the east by land and water on the 9th. They suffered heavy casualties after being intercepted by Chinese forces in Boluo and other places. On the morning of the 11th, the Japanese sent large-scale reinforcements. Due to strategic considerations, the Chinese forces withdrew from Boluo and Huiyang City in the afternoon. Chinese and Japanese forces are still engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs of Huiyang City. (2) Over 3,000 Japanese troops from Shenwang, northeast of Guangzhou, launched an offensive towards Shiqian City, Dawo Lang, Fengyunling, and Baitan Wang. They have now been repelled by the Chinese forces. Another unit that invaded north from Longxiang was able to briefly capture the county seat, but after a fierce counteroffensive by the Chinese forces, the Hua County seat was completely retaken.

<h3>American Writer Ernest Hemingway Risks His Life at the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The local "Mecy News" today published on the front page the adventurous achievements of American famous writer Ernest Hemingway at the Guangdong front lines. It stated that Hemingway followed the Chinese troops into Guangzhou one night while in Shaoguan. The Chinese troops destroyed several Japanese military buildings that night. They traveled in a sand boat, sailing downstream at night, landed near Guangzhou, completed the demolition work, and safely withdrew before dawn. It is reported that this adventure left a deep impression on Hemingway, proving that the Japanese troops in the occupied cities often retreat to safe places at night to avoid attacks by Chinese guerrillas.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Eve of Further Expansion of the European War</h3>
<p>After the Balkan War came to an end at the end of last month, Hitler, as usual, launched a political offensive full of shining eyes to prepare for the next step of military action - the target of this offensive includes at least the four countries of the Soviet Union, Turkey, France, and Spain. He will not act rashly before the political arrangements are properly made, which is why the Iraq War has already broken out, but he has not been actively involved. According to common sense, regardless of whether the Iraqi government has formally requested assistance, the British-Iraqi conflict is an excellent opportunity for the Nazis to advance eastward, but Hitler would rather "sit idly by" and first busy himself with his political and diplomatic offensive. It can be seen that although he is an aggressive demon king, he also knows how to use the clear training of steady progress. This is his cunning and also his superiority over other aggressors. Now, let's review Germany's foreign activities in the days before the re-expansion of the war.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about relations with the Soviet Union. No matter how intense the rumors of Germany and the Soviet Union dividing the Near East are, with Nazi forces spreading throughout the Balkans and already approaching the Soviet Union's doorstep, the situation of German-Soviet cooperation seems to have reached a saturation point. Hitler's current attitude towards the Soviet Union, unless he has ulterior motives, seems to only require the Moscow government to strictly maintain neutrality. There is no need to exchange for Soviet participation in the war at an excessively high price, so as to give Stalin the opportunity to share the war's profits, and there is no need to immediately invade the Soviet Union to create another enemy. In other words, at present, it seems that only need to feign friendship, using strength to force Moscow to stay out of the way, which is enough.</p>
<p>As for relations with Turkey, judging from Ambassador Papen's full of goodwill and busy providing guarantees, it is expected that Hitler's immediate plan is only to effectively dismantle the alliance between Britain and Turkey, so that Turkey will join the Axis, on the one hand increasing its own prestige, and on the other hand打击 British's momentum, thereby facilitating his actions in the Near East and North Africa. Only in this way, in order to make it easier for the Ankara government to "bite the hook," he will probably not put forward demands that Turkey cannot accept for a while. In essence, Hitler only needs to ask Turkey to abandon its alliance with Britain and join his own camp. Besides this, there is no need to - at least for now - put forward requests such as transit, so as not to be self-defeating and repeat the mistakes of Yugoslavia's resistance.</p>
<p>Regarding Spain, what Germany hopes for is nothing more than forcing Franco to join the Axis to assist in attacking Gibraltar. However, whether it is for the convenience of oppression or to make oppression easier to achieve results, it is necessary to first bring France to submission. Because on the one hand, it is easier to succeed in oppressing defeated Vichy, and on the other hand, once France is included, Spain will of course find it more difficult to firmly refuse. Therefore, although Germany's political offensive has several targets at the same time these days, it is undoubtedly first concentrated on Vichy. Judging from the recent establishment of the Franco-German economic and transportation agreement, and Dalang's visit to Germany to meet with Hitler, it can be seen that the situation of Franco-German cooperation has indeed matured considerably. Up to now, it is only known that Germany has agreed to revise the boundaries of the free zone and the occupied zone, and reduce the amount of supplies paid by the occupying forces. As for the price paid by Vichy, both France and Germany are tight-lipped. The only thing that can be seen in fact is the "transit" of German aircraft to Syria. Then, at the lowest limit, Syria's being used as an eastward stepping stone must have been included in the terms of cooperation.</p>
<p>Why did the Pétain government, which has always been able to reject the harsh demands of the German side, finally accept cooperation? To answer this question, it seems that we must praise Hitler's political tactics of avoiding the important and taking the light, and adapting to the times. Originally, what Germany asked Vichy for in the past was to hand over the fleet and the ports on both sides of the Mediterranean. This was a matter of life and death for the French Empire, and the Pétain government would of course refuse it with the determination to resist again. Today, Hitler, on the one hand, already knows that this matter cannot be rushed, and on the other hand, he is even more opportunistic, with a rare opportunity for advancing eastward right in front of him. Therefore, he is happy to temporarily "lower his demands" and only put forward some requests that do not involve France's so-called "vital interests" in order to win Vichy's cooperation. For example, using Syria to open up a shortcut to aid Iraq may be one of the conditions that Vichy is more likely to accept. Everyone knows that Syria is Germany's springboard for eastward expansion, just like Vietnam is Japan's springboard for southward expansion. Vichy was able to concede to Japan on the Vietnam issue in the past, and of course it can be more submissive to Germany on the Syria issue today. What's more, Germany also has considerable prices for reducing the supply of occupying forces and revising the boundaries, which seems to be even easier to induce Pétain to soften.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that Hitler's political offensive this time, at least as far as France is concerned, has achieved considerable success. Or he may even launch the Near East War with this achievement. It is expected that it will be revealed in the next few days. As for the French position, there are bound to be advantages and disadvantages in everything in the world. Although compromise with Germany can temporarily ease the tense situation since the dismissal of Laval last winter, on the contrary, it will inevitably worsen the relations between Britain and France, and even between the United States and France. The British bombing of Syria and President Roosevelt's dissatisfaction with France are signs of this change. Assuming that Britain and France really come to blows, turning former allies into enemies who kill each other, then it will be the most unfortunate event in the second year of the European War, and even a great tragedy for mankind. Thinking of this, one cannot help but hope that the current French authorities will not delay the long-term national fortune because of temporary small gains.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Hold Five-Minister Conference to Discuss China Policy; Indian Newspaper Says Japanese Offensive Is Not Worth Worrying About</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Sources in Japan said today that the Japanese cabinet will hold a five-minister conference in the next few days, and the results may bring Japan's China policy into a new stage. It is understood that the conference is the result of separate consultations between the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Navy Minister, the Army Minister, and the Finance Minister. (Associated Press Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to well-informed sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka discussed various issues concerning China with the Soviet Ambassador to Japan yesterday during a meeting. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bombay: The Indian Times editorial, commenting on Japan's new offensive in China, said that in general, everyone believes that Matsuoka's return from Berlin is a subtle sign that Japan is redefining its policies. That it is focusing on the Pacific, rather than the Chinese mainland. However, judging from current events, the Japanese side seems to have launched an unexpected move. If this is the case, then the news that Hitler is eager to conclude a wide-ranging solution with the Soviet Union can reveal his intention. Hitler is preparing to give the Soviet Union a free hand in dealing with Japan in exchange for recovering Ukrainian wheat and Caucasian mineral oil. Hitler now believes that Japan is neither willing nor able to carry out effective actions in the Far East that would restrain Britain and the United States. As for China, it has long been capable of dealing with Japan, so there is no reason to worry about the results of Japan's new offensive. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>British Planes Bomb Syria; Syrian Commissioner Protests; Vichy Claims No Hostility Towards Britain, America, or Italy; Considers British Action Not an Act of Aggression</h3>
<p>London, Beirut - Last night, the radio station broadcast the Syrian authorities' statement, initially acknowledging the presence of German planes in Syria but strongly condemning the British planes bombing Syrian airfields in Palmyra, Damascus, and Rayak. It stated that such actions by the British were among many heinous acts of hostility towards France. The Syrian Commissioner, Dentz, has lodged a protest with the British Consul-General.</p>
<p>The statement also mentioned that recently, when German planes flew over Syria, fifteen were forced to land at Syrian airfields. The French authorities, in accordance with the armistice terms, took steps to ensure that these planes could leave as quickly as possible to the fullest extent possible. However, without issuing a warning, the British sent planes on May 14th and 15th to bomb the Palmyra and Rayak air bases, even though no German planes had landed there. In the first raid, one French officer was killed and several others were injured. Today, the airfields of Hilafé, Rayak, and Mezzi near Beirut were strafed by British planes but sustained no damage. British planes are also daily dropping leaflets in Syrian and Lebanese cities and towns, inciting the public to revolt.</p>
<p>A British communiqué stated that yesterday, when British planes attacked Palmyra, they strafed five German planes and one Italian plane, severely damaging at least three of them. Another plane caught fire after being hit. Other airfields were attacked, and although no detailed reports are available, it is known that large fires broke out and many enemy planes were destroyed. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Vichy - This morning, the Vichy government issued a statement indicating that it would not regard the British bombing of Syrian bases as an act of aggression. The statement, in response to the U.S. President, said that France is eager to safeguard its status as a major power and maintain the security of its territory and empire. It has the right to discuss reorganizing Europe with its conquerors, and this action does not imply any attack on Britain, let alone the United States. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Free French Representative Broadcast Appeals to Syrians to Take Up Arms Against the Enemy</p>
<p>Cairo - Last night, General Catroux, the Free French representative in the Middle East, broadcast an appeal to Syria. It stated that 800 tons of arms and ammunition taken from French storage depots in Baalbek have been transported to Baghdad, and that enemy planes have landed in Beirut, Rayak, Aleppo, and Damascus. Seventeen enemy planes landed at the Mezzi airfield one morning. Catroux concluded by saying that if Syrians choose to take up arms and drive out the enemy, he and French patriots are nearby and will assist. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Iraqi Cabinet Member's Persuasion Fails; The Hejaz Remains Pro-British</p>
<p>Cairo - It is heard that when the King of Hejaz, Ibn Saud, recently met with the Finance Minister of the Gailani government, Shiwardi, he told him that if he agreed with Ali Gailani's policies, he would receive assistance early on. It is said that Ibn Saud also stated that the only path for Arabs at present is to support Britain. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Vichy Adopts Pro-German Policies; Inevitably Drawn Back into the Whirlwind of War; Eden's Remarks Tantamount to a Declaration of War Against France</h3>
<p>London - Commentators here believe that since Vichy has adopted a pro-German policy, it may eventually be drawn back into the war. Once Britain invades Syria to prevent German forces from establishing a base to attack Palestine, clashes between British and French forces are possible. The first result of the Franco-German policy was the announcement by British Foreign Secretary Eden that British forces are "taking appropriate measures" to deal with German planes landing at Syrian airfields. A political commentator for the "News Times" stated that members of parliament generally believe Eden's announcement is, in effect, a declaration of war against Vichy. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding British Foreign Secretary Eden's threat to consider Syria a war zone if Syrian airfields are used by Germany, the French authorities here have remained calm after the news reached here that Britain will join the bombing efforts if Syrian airfields are used by Germany. It is said here that if Britain attacks, France will retaliate. As for the question of whether this violates the armistice agreement, it concerns Germany and France themselves. Moreover, the agreement stipulates that both signatory countries can modify it at any time. Furthermore, Marshal Pétain, the head of France, recently made a speech to the nation, announcing to the country that France must pursue a European policy in order to rebuild its strong position. Therefore, Britain should not expect France to support its plan to expand the war. France cannot currently decide on future military policy. Regarding the possibility of the United States participating in the war due to the development of the Syrian situation, Vichy officials remain calm. As for the U.S. threat to stop supplying food, officials here consider it serious but not enough to determine France's attitude. However, in order to ensure the supply of food needed by the country, France will have to seek assistance from European countries, especially Germany, which may cause the United States to regret it.

<h3>Japanese Military Delegation Going to Italy From Germany for Inspection</h3>
<p>Rome - Yesterday, officials here announced that two Japanese army inspection teams will arrive in Italy this weekend to inspect the Italian front and naval and army factories. According to the Tripartite Pact, the team has been inspecting in Germany for several months and will now stay in Italy for two weeks. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>America Determined to Maintain Freedom of the Seas; President Roosevelt Recalls Historical Events in Response to German Declaration of Naval Blockade</h3>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, President Roosevelt virtually disregarded the effectiveness of the German blockade in the Red Sea and recalled that the United States had twice engaged in undeclared wars over similar issues. At a press conference, President Roosevelt declared that the international situation is extremely serious and does not allow him to answer speculative questions. He said that freedom of the seas is a traditional policy of the United States. President Roosevelt stated that the German declaration of a Red Sea war zone raises the question of Germany's ability to create an effective blockade there. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, while discussing Germany's announcement of the Red Sea as a dangerous area for foreign ships at a press briefing, President Roosevelt pointed out that the United States had twice used its warships to protect commerce and obtain freedom of the seas in its history. The President mentioned the war against the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean and the war against Caribbean pirates a hundred years ago. A reporter asked the President if he thought there were new-style Barbary pirates now. In his answer, the President advised him to use his own brain and said that freedom of the seas is a policy that the United States has traditionally followed. However, the President did not indicate what action the United States was preparing to take regarding the Red Sea, only saying that he was recalling historical events to provide journalists with some guidance.

<h3>American Sailors Sailing to the Far East Demand War Risk Pay</h3>
<p>New York - The American Export Lines ships "Exmouth" and "Exbrook" were unable to depart for India as scheduled yesterday because the crew refused to serve. The crew members made a new demand that they should be paid a bonus of US$60 per month per person, and US$50 more upon arrival at the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. In addition, the "Commercial Report" stated that Pacific coast shipping companies had agreed with the crew to pay each person a war risk fee of $40 per Pacific crossing (to the Far East or Australia), and $60 for going to Africa, the Red Sea, or the Persian Gulf. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Refutes the United States</h3>
<p>Berlin - Officials here declared yesterday that regarding the British and American criticisms of France for allowing belligerent countries to transport military supplies through its territory to third countries, this concerns France alone, so Germany should not make any further comments. However, objectively speaking, Berlin officials believe that temporarily allowing the transportation of military supplies is very different from the British repairing damaged warships in American shipyards for several weeks. Therefore, if there is a precedent for military supplies passing through other countries, then this precedent was created by the British and American governments. Regarding the British allegations that German planes flew to Syria, the Foreign Ministry here declined to comment because it concerned military matters. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Denies Permitting Volunteers to Aid Iraq; Statement Not True</h3>
<p>Moscow - Havas reported that the Baghdad radio station recently rebroadcast the "Soviet Official Gazette," which said that "the Soviet government has agreed to gather Soviet volunteer pilots to serve in Iraq."

<h3>Navigation Danger Zone Extended to Eastern Mediterranean, Excluding Turkish Territorial Waters; British Government Issues Notice</h3>
<p>London - The British government has issued a notice stating that the scope of the Mediterranean navigation danger zone announced in February and April of this year has now been extended to the eastern sea area, excluding Turkish territorial waters. Any ships navigating in this area without the permission of the British naval authorities will do so at their own risk. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced yesterday a new danger zone in the eastern Mediterranean, prohibiting ships from sailing there. This measure is likely intended to blockade the route to Syria. This declaration is equivalent to pointing out that the entire Mediterranean Sea east of Sardinia is a danger zone. According to international law, Britain has the right to lay mines there without prior notice. Any ship that has not been approved by the British may be regarded as an enemy ship. This new danger zone covers a total of 100,000 square miles, bringing the total to 600,000 square miles. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Defense Exercises; Speedboats Active, Cannons Boom</h3>
<p>Algeciras - Gibraltar's large-caliber guns held target practice exercises toward the Mediterranean this morning. Aircraft controlled the area around Gibraltar, and many speedboats were active in the harbor. The British battleship "Renown" and destroyer "H700" are still being repaired in the port of Gibraltar. In addition, a British armed merchant ship carrying a large amount of ammunition arrived in Gibraltar. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Spain Strengthens Administrative Agencies; Major Changes in Personnel</h3>
<p>Madrid - "Pueblo" newspaper military correspondent Salazar published an article in the newspaper yesterday discussing the chances of Gibraltar resisting an attack or siege. He stated that, from a current military point of view, Gibraltar can no longer be regarded as a first-class base. Bombers can attack it, and long-range guns can bombard it. Therefore, the situation in Gibraltar is no longer the same as in the past and can no longer be defended. Moreover, within a hundred kilometers around Gibraltar, there are no other first-class air bases. It is only a naval base in itself. Therefore, it is impossible to effectively resist air raids. Moreover, the value of the Gibraltar naval base is also questionable. Ships cannot safely dock or be repaired there, so it is only a naval base in name. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3>Jews in France Forced to Perform Labor Service</h3>
<p>Madrid - Reports from Paris state that foreign Jews residing in France have recently been summoned to perform forced labor service. Prior to this, foreign Jews were ordered to report to the police station with one family member within 48 hours. When the Jews gathered, their family members were ordered to go home within an hour to bring a change of clothes and toiletries. An hour later, the Jews were escorted to the Austerlitz railway station and transported to various areas of the occupied territories to perform labor service. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>American Republics Prepare to Take Over French Territories; May Deploy Troops if Necessary; Control Stepping Stone for Invasion of South America</h3>
<p>Washington - The American republics may have discussed whether to take over Martinique and other French territories in the Western Hemisphere based on the Havana Act. Reliable sources recall that under the Havana Act, the American republics would not allow French territories in the Western Hemisphere to change hands. Diplomatic circles also pointed out that the provisions of the Act originally allowed the United States to occupy any threatened foreign territory, which would be discussed after the war. Martinique can be seen on the Saint Lucia base newly acquired by the United States from Britain. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>New York - According to responsible sources in Washington, 21 American countries are prepared to establish a joint management agency for France's American colonies when the war extends to the Western Hemisphere. The United States will not take any decisive steps until this cooperation is clarified, but it is said that complete plans have been prepared for the actions necessary to ensure the safety of the American continent. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Military experts predict that if France truly unites with Germany, Britain and the United States may take swift action to occupy this vast French colonial empire, which accounts for 4.6 million square miles of the world. Experts also predict that when the Franco-German agreement is first signed, the United States may immediately send troops to Martinique and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean region. These experts also believe that the U.S. President's appeal to the French people implies that U.S. troops may be sent to Dakar in West Africa to control this stepping stone for the invasion of South America. Military experts also predict that Canada will also send troops to the French islands of Flague-Rong and Saint Pierre off the coast of Canada in the North Atlantic, and Latin American troops will also enter French Guiana. Military experts believe that Martinique and Dakar are both dangerous areas because the port of Martinique has a new French aircraft carrier and a cruiser, as well as 1,000 American-made aircraft, which were left in Martinique after the French defeat. In addition, it is said that Martinique also has a huge amount of French gold reserves. Experts also believe that Australia and New Zealand will occupy the French islands in the South Pacific, which total 13,352 square miles. As for the fate of France's territories in Asia, it is not yet known. However, Japan has gained a foothold in Vietnam, and the French territory of East India will be immediately occupied by Britain. Experts are also skeptical about the feasibility of occupying French African colonies because occupying this vast area requires a huge amount of troops. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Oklahoma Democratic Senator Lee said last night that the time has come for the Western Hemisphere to acquire the port of Dakar and contain the Axis powers from using the French West African colonial region and the Western Hemisphere. He also said, "Our slogan should be 'Drive Hitler's forces out of West Africa.'" He also said, "Dakar is a giant cannon aimed directly at South America and threatens the Western Hemisphere." Lee refused to say whether the occupation of Dakar should be carried out by the United States or Britain. He concluded by saying that if we are strategically defeated by others, then the huge wealth previously spent on military use will be useless. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>U.S.-French Relations Will Be Severed</h3>
<p>Washington - It is widely believed that the United States' diplomatic relations with the Vichy government will soon be severed. Therefore, newspapers are now full of news about U.S.-French relations, and there is no longer any news about Hess. President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the international situation is extremely serious and that he should not further explain or comment on the meaning of his request to the French people. Reporters asked questions one after another, wanting to know the President's opinion, and some asked whether Ambassador Leahy, the U.S. ambassador to Vichy, would be recalled. The President did not answer because many of the questions were hypothetical. Others said that the President's request to the French people was a warning to the Vichy government. The President replied that his statement had already spoken for itself and did not need to be explained. As for whether the United States would adopt the practice of taking over some colonies in the Western Hemisphere of European countries based on its agreement with Latin American countries, it would be a great revolution. However, since British Prime Minister Churchill's advice to the French people last year had no effect, the U.S. President's appeal may also be difficult to achieve. The recent basis of American policy is to enlist France or at least French colonies to join the Allied countries and to realize the ideal of comrades in war. America is also based on the principle of democratic system. The U.S. government's policy in its relations with the French government is based on the armistice conditions between Germany and France and the recognition of certain restrictions imposed on the French government by the armistice conditions. Not only that, but the United States also obtained from the head of France a solution of cooperation with Germany that exceeded the needs of the armistice agreement, and stated that France trusts the wise and patriotic policies promoted by Marshal Pétain and opposes any divisive actions. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Vichy - France yesterday unofficially recognized reports that its cooperation with Germany would deliver French colonies to Germany and that France would attack Britain or even the United States. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Responsible people here said yesterday that regarding the British and American criticism of France for allowing belligerent countries to transport military supplies through its territory to third countries, this concerns France alone, so Germany should not make any further comments. However, objectively speaking, officials in Berlin believe that temporarily allowing the transportation of military supplies is very different from the British repairing damaged warships in American shipyards for several weeks. Therefore, if there is a precedent for military supplies passing through other countries, then this magazine, published by the Curtis Publishing Company, was created by Fuller, who said, "I am a consistent isolationist, and so is the Saturday Evening Post. But this policy will change next week. We are now in a war. We are as if we have jumped off the springboard, but have not yet reached the water, our bodies are not yet wet, but we can no longer return to the springboard." (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Federal Security Administrator McNutt warned last night that Hitler is threatening American freedom and is approaching us. He emphasized that the United States must preserve the strength of democracy to fight the world's dictators. He spoke at a meeting of the Boy Scouts of America and outlined the various problems facing the Boy Scouts in a world crisis. He said, "The various ideas that we think are our life compass are threatened by one person (Hitler). He is now gradually approaching us with a gun to our heads. At this time, to prevent its sovereignty from changing, you may wish to inquire from the State Department whether Vichy will continue to receive two American wheat ships per month, or whether it is unaware of the closer cooperation between Vichy and the Axis powers.</p>
<h3>President's Appeal May Be Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>The Washington Post discussed the U.S. President's last-minute speech to the French people, urging them to prevent the Pétain government from falling into Hitler's arms. It said that although Marshal Pétain is respected in France, his pronouncements to the people in a dictatorial tone are overly self-confident. The French people have always thought for themselves, and even the hero of Verdun may not be able to make the French people listen to him. If the French people really obey orders and are able to make this ideal a reality, officials are greatly disappointed.</p>
<h3>French Ships Have Been Monitored</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt's appeal to the French people yesterday was broadcast to France by shortwave radio. The President said that the American people can hardly believe that the French government would be willing to participate in an automatic alliance plan and cause France and its colonies to lose their existence. The abandonment of French African colonies and their Atlantic ports would be a major disaster for the peace and security of the Western Mediterranean. He thought that the French people would never accept any agreement of so-called cooperation, which in essence contains the meaning of an alliance with a strong country, and the central and basic policies of this strong country are to completely destroy freedom everywhere in the world, which is a guarantee that France is unwilling to comply with. When the U.S. President announced the above remarks, the U.S. Coast Guard Command announced that all French ships in U.S. ports, including the Normandie, are now under the control of armed patrols. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Statement by the U.S. President: France in Bewilderment and Unease; Ambassador Henry Received American Press and Explained French Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Vichy: According to the French Information Agency, government officials expressed surprise at President Roosevelt's statement, referring to Pétain's alleged consent to allow Germany to use French colonies. Furthermore, the U.S. sent guards to oversee ten French ships docked at American ports (including the Normandie), and the U.S. issued a semi-official statement that it was considering occupying French West Indies and Guiana, which caused further bewilderment and incomprehension. Recalling that France was abandoned by the Allies last May, and the U.S. did not respond to France's appeals, now, for the sake of maintaining France's territorial integrity and great power status, France has the right to consider, together with its victorious nations, the conditions for jointly reorganizing the European continent. All of these actions do not mean that France intends to attack Britain, nor does it have any intentions towards the U.S. Although France is unwilling to believe that the Anglo-Saxon countries deliberately intend to invade France, the British air raids on Syrian airfields and Foreign Secretary Eden's threats to Syria cannot but raise suspicions. Regarding this matter, Ambassador Henry to the U.S. has explained to the American press the views of the French people as created by the current British and American governments. Regarding the British accusation of German planes flying to Syria, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here refused to comment due to the military nature of the matter. (Reuters, May 17)</p>
<p>Vichy: The negotiations between Cabinet Coordinator Darlan and the German authorities have yielded some concrete results. Marshal Pétain's speech yesterday only called on the people to trust him, without detailing the progress of the negotiations, presumably because the negotiations have not yet concluded. These negotiations are still in progress, with the sole purpose of increasing European unity. (Havas, May 16)</p>
<h3>U.S. Forced, Inevitably to Join the War; McNutt Warns That American Freedom is Threatened</h3>
<p>Seattle: The general manager of the publishing company of "The Saturday Evening Post," the magazine with the largest circulation in the United States, stated last night that the newspaper would abandon its consistent policy of supporting isolationism. There is a small morality in the world, unashamed violence, rampant, using the blood pressure of European life for its supply. This violence is now entering the Near East, and its greedy eyes are on Africa, and in league with its accomplices, plotting in the Far East. If the Nazi threat succeeds, the Boy Scout movement will be replaced by the Hitler Youth." He reiterated the necessity of preserving democratic strength, saying, "It is ridiculous for one-third of a nation that is a squalid area to want to build 50,000 aircraft to defend it. It is hypocritical that we have millions of people fighting for justice, while their families die from malnutrition and disease. The democratic system is worth preserving, but the battle to defend democracy does not begin in military camps." (Associated Press, May 17)</p>
<h3>Two Hundred American Heavy Bombers to be Shipped to Britain</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Times reported that Meerloo, a member of the U.S. Maritime Labor Board, who returned to the U.S. from Britain, told Roosevelt that Britain needed a large number of heavy bombers to protect navigation and tanks to defend England. If Britain could obtain 200 heavy bombers from the U.S. now, it would definitely prevent German submarines from operating in the Atlantic. It is said that before the end of the summer, the U.S. will supply Britain with no less than 200 heavy bombers. (TASS, May 16)</p>

All Australian cabinet members attended the banquet. Acting Australian Prime Minister Fadden and Kleffens both gave speeches at the dinner, emphasizing the friendship between Australia and the Netherlands.

They attended a reception in the evening and are scheduled to return to Sydney on the 17th. (Reuters, May 17)</p>
<h3>Americans Raise Funds to Aid China: China Week Begins</h3>
<p>New York: New York Mayor LaGuardia announced today that "China Week" will begin tomorrow and urged citizens to generously donate to the relief of China. China Week will feature performances organized by the United China Relief, with the aim of raising $5 million in the United States, with New York's quota being $1.7 million. The Chinese sailing junk "Xiamen," which crossed the Pacific from Shanghai in 87 days and arrived in New York, will be placed in Battery Park for a week. Fifty beautiful Chinese women and one hundred American girls will jointly solicit donations along the streets. (Associated Press, May 17)</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Guarantees War Materiel Will Reach Britain, and Addresses Naval and Military Academies: Do Not Repeat the Mistake of Reducing Strength</h3>
<p>Newport, Rhode Island: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox said here yesterday that the biggest development in the past 24 hours was the Vichy government's turn to Germany. The Vichy government is now under German control and cannot govern itself, and is subject to severe punishment for defeat. Knox referred to Hess, saying that he did not think Hess was mentally deranged, but felt that he was acting under instructions. He then spoke of the U.S. Navy, saying that if asked whether he could guarantee that U.S. war materiel would reach Britain, he would definitely say "yes." If asked what kind of guarantee method to use, then the questioner can use their own brains. In the last war, there was only one threat, namely submarines. Now there is one threat, namely submarines, surface raiders, and aircraft.</p>
<h3>A Strong Navy Must Be Maintained</h3>
<p>Knox later addressed the graduating class of the National Naval and Military Academy, saying that the world must prevent the emergence of another Hitler in the coming decades. We must maintain the right to improve human well-being. Even if we have to spend our material resources in defensive wars, we should not hesitate to maintain this right. The United States needs to maintain a strong navy both in peacetime and in wartime. Because of disarmament, Germany dared to challenge the world six years after Hitler came to power. We dare to say that if the world abandons its police power again after Germany's defeat in Europe, there will be a second Hitler to harm the world in twenty or thirty years. History has repeatedly shown individuals who believe they can rule the world, such as Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, and Hitler. After each person's failure, the self-deceivers in the world are comforted by the thought that there will be no one like them in the future. But we must know that this is not the case. Therefore, those serving in the navy should each take responsibility and devote their lives to ensuring that the navy does not repeat the mistake of reducing its strength after every war since the American Revolution.

<h3>Random Thoughts on the European War: Record of the Great Fire of London</h3>
<p>At that time, the sky was full of red light, but we both knew that this night was the night of the Great Fire of London, and the fire seemed to be increasing unabated. Therefore, Magley suggested going along the embankment to see what was happening.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Thames, we saw that the river had become a red ribbon. Except for the general burning barges with yellow flames, there were two places, the larger one being the warehouse, with deep yellow flames shooting out, but all we saw was a red color, reflecting the red light in the sky. But the most intense part of the fire was clearly on this bank of the river.</p>
<p>We couldn't see a single taxi, except for the police and air raid wardens. Most of the civilians were running for cover. Suddenly, we saw things jumping around in all directions around us. At first, I thought they were shrapnel, but later I saw that each piece of shrapnel exploded into fireballs the size of cats, emitting the green light of mercury vapor lamps. Then I knew they were incendiary bombs. Two of them landed less than three yards away from us, jumping around on the street. We saw air raid wardens running to put out the fire and heard calls for help from roof lookouts.</p>
<p>These incendiary bombs all landed near us, burning on the sidewalk without causing any harm, but they raised Magley's anger. I turned around and saw her kicking an incendiary bomb into the gutter with force. This bomb landed near the glass window of a sidewalk shop, and the glass was already blistering and melting. I saw Magley picking up one foot with her hand and hopping on the other, and hurriedly took off her shoe. The sole of the shoe had been burned through, but fortunately the sole of the sock was only scorched. She said that the sole of her foot might blister, but in any case, it was worth it.</p>
<p>We crossed a street and ran to a bank, where many sandbags were piled up around the bank to protect the people's deposits. We moved a total of six bags and poured the contents of the bags onto the incendiary bombs burning on all sides. What came out of the bags was not sand but ash, but the fire-extinguishing effect was no less than that of sand.</p>
<p>Roofs on both sides of the street were on fire. First, thick smoke rose above the eaves, and then orange-yellow flames shot out from the windows on the top floor. Because this area is the commercial and financial district of London, most of the houses are empty and uninhabited, and there are very few roof lookouts, so the air raid wardens below only knew where the fire was after seeing the firelight. At this time, I suddenly remembered what I had seen and heard in Berlin a year ago. At a reception for journalists at the Foreign Ministry, a National Socialist journalist said to us shamelessly that although London was large, Germany could set fire to all its docks, wharves, and other buildings at any time. I had always put these words out of my mind, but now I remembered them.</p>
<p>Therefore, Magley said that perhaps that matter was real, and this fire might not be limited to a local area, but might become a prairie fire that would not be extinguished all night. I said that no matter what, now was the best time for dinner.</p>
<p>Except for the Savoy Restaurant nearby, all the shops had closed. The Savoy is the most noble hotel in London and the safest air raid shelter. The diners in the restaurant were all dressed impeccably, and many were wearing uniforms. Their faces were as calm as they were at the Munich Conference. As soon as you leave the door of the Savoy, you will feel the courage, politeness, and patience of the British people, and you will unconsciously like the British. Magley and I both felt this way at the same time.</p>
<p>After dinner, we ran to the street and saw that the orange-yellow firelight was brighter. Although there was no fire nearby, the firelight half a mile away was reflected by the thousands of feet of smoke. The Germans were circling the thick smoke. Suddenly, we heard a slow whistle, gradually increasing in pitch, and knew that a large bomb was falling. Several soldiers on leave in London were crossing the intersection in front of us. When they heard the whistle of the falling bomb, they immediately lay down on the ground, right in the middle of the intersection. This was a habit they had been trained to do, but they didn't know it was the wrong thing to do, because shrapnel could fly in from all directions at the intersection. It would have been better to run into a house. Fortunately, the bomb landed at least 200 yards away, so there were no accidents.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we saw a taxi coming down the street from the direction of the raging fire. We hailed him, and the car stopped. The driver looked flustered, looking around, his ears twitching, and the car was soaked with water. He seemed to be still in shock. When he heard that we wanted him to take us to the fire, he said that he would never go back there again, no matter what. He said that the whole city was on fire and could not be controlled, and it would be burned to rubble tonight. He was about to run out of the city. Magley said that she didn't want to travel with such a frightened person, so we walked on.</p>

<h3>U.S. Coal Miners Strike: Affecting National Defense Production</h3>
<p>New York: The production of national defense industries suffered another serious blow yesterday, as new negotiations between southern coal mine owners and the United Mine Workers of America have stalled. Mine Workers Union President Lewis predicted that if this issue cannot be resolved, it will cause a production crisis in the United States. Lewis also announced that the meeting had to be postponed because both sides insisted on their opinions. (Associated Press, May 17)</p>
<h3>Aggressors Will Ultimately Be Defeated: Hull Speaks at the Pan American Union</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull said in a speech at the Pan American Union that the fundamental issue in the current world war is whether the world will be organized into a group of peaceful, independent, and cooperative nations, or ruled by a savage group. Attempts to control the world by violence will be defeated within a considerable period of time, just as all those in history who have conquered and managed the world by force have failed. But we must endure hardship and sacrifice. The United States must be able to resist foreign aggression. (Associated Press, May 17)</p>

<h3>North African Front: Tug-of-War Between British and German Forces; German Counterattack Recaptures Sollum; Italian Troops in Abyssinia Face Increasing Difficulties</h3>
<p>Berlin: This morning, an official German communique stated that Germany had recaptured the Sollum, Capuzzo Fortress, and Sidi Azeiz regions. British forces had stormed into the above-mentioned cities. After the German counterattack yesterday, they drove the enemy back again. More than one hundred British soldiers were captured in the Sollum area, and two British armored vehicles were destroyed. Three officers and twenty-two soldiers were captured. (Haitong, May 16)</p>
<p>Cairo: After British infantry and mechanized tank units repelled five advancing German forces, forcing them to retreat to their original positions, they took advantage of the momentum and launched a fierce attack, driving the enemy out of Sollum Musaid (a village on top of the Sollum escarpment) and Halfaya Pass (six or seven miles southeast of Sollum). There are no detailed reports of enemy casualties and injuries. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Amba Alagi area of Abyssinia, where the Italian troops are facing increasing difficulties. Italian troops are fleeing south from various places, mostly soldiers. Although the British capture of Musaid village was not a major offensive, it is commendable, as the defenders could rely on the steep cliffs to fight from the Sollum side, which is of great benefit. Moreover, the top of the escarpment is flat, and the defenders can use artillery to harass the attacking troops below the slope. Also, the Halfaya Pass is within the range of the guns of the Bardia garrison. Although there are no detailed reports of the battle, the British Empire forces are extremely brave, taking advantage of the momentum to quickly attack and occupy the slope and this mountain pass. It is said that the British army's conquest of Musaid is of great military importance, as it has opened the road to attack Libya from the top of the slope. Military officials in Cairo are quite optimistic, believing that yesterday's victory is the prelude to the British strategy that can defeat the German army in Africa, giving them a lesson and letting them know that the Nazi war plan in the western desert is neither suitable for the climate nor an enemy of the British army that has been trained in the desert for many years.

<h3>Goods Shipped from South America to the Soviet Union: Detained in San Francisco; Soviet Union Protests to the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington: On May 7, the U.S. State Department ordered the detention of a large quantity of wool and leather purchased by the Soviet Union in Argentina and Uruguay. The goods had arrived in San Francisco when they were detained and were being transferred to the Swedish ship "Columbia" for shipment back to the Soviet Union. On May 14, Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Umansky visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull and lodged a serious protest on behalf of the Soviet government. The Swedish ship "Columbia" was leased by "Amtorg," the Soviet trade organization in the U.S., and was also detained. (TASS, May 17)</p>
<h3>More Than One Hundred German Planes: Bombing Birmingham Madly; Bombs Fell Like Rain for Three Hours; British Air Force Attacked German Industrial Areas</h3>
<p>Berlin: German planes heavily bombed Birmingham last night. More than one hundred German planes bombed the city's factories and supply stations for more than three hours, and fires broke out everywhere. (Haitong, May 17)</p>
<p>London: This morning, German planes again launched fierce air raids in the Midlands region. Houses, shops, and other properties were bombed and burned, and the number of deaths seems to be very high. The air raids started last night, and tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped continuously. It seemed that the attacks were concentrated on a certain area of the West Midlands for a while, but it is believed that the casualties are not very heavy. In another part of the area, incendiary bombs fell like rain, and a high-explosive bomb directly hit an air raid shelter, and it is feared that there will be many casualties there. According to officials, two German planes were shot down last night. In another area of the West Midlands, many civilians were buried in the debris of destroyed houses. Bombs also fell on market towns in the East Midlands, but there were no casualties. A town in the Midlands was also attacked. (Associated Press, May 17)</p>
<p>London: Last night, the British Air Force heavily bombed the industrial areas on both sides of the Cologne River, and fires broke out. The wharves of Borough also suffered a small part of the British aircraft's bombing, which was quite successful. Yesterday, the British Air Force attacked and sank an enemy supply ship of 2,500 tons off the coast of Norway. (Reuters, May 17)</p>
<h3>Views on the Defection of Prominent German Figure Hess: Henderson Expresses His Opinion</h3>
<p>London: Former British Ambassador to Germany Henderson made his first comments in Lincolnshire yesterday regarding Hess's defection, saying that Hess has always been one of the most ardent supporters of Hitler and is a sincere person. Considering the impression his defection has created in Germany, the theory that Hess came to Britain with a secret mission is out of the question. From his perspective, Hess probably realized in the past two years that Nazism was on the wrong track and was merely a tool for the selfish interests of German villains such as Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Ley. He knew Hess when he was working in Germany and considered him to be Hitler's adopted son. Hitler loved him very much, and Hess also cared for Hitler very much. He knew that Hess was one of the first to join Nazism. In terms of the order of joining the party, Hitler was seventh and Hess was twenty-first. Germany considers it a great honor to be among the first one hundred people to join the party. He does not believe that Hess's coming to Britain will reveal German secrets or act as a spy. The important step taken by Hess today, which could arouse Hitler's anger, can show how deep the feelings are in Germany today. Those who hope that the British government will not be fooled by Hess can rest assured that the British government only treats Hess as a Nazi member. (Reuters, May 17)</p>
<p>London: The National Savings Committee stated that the wreckage of the plane Hess was flying in when he flew to Scotland could not be transported to London for exhibition, so the people of London did not have the opportunity to see the German plane. (Reuters, May 17)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the defection of Nazi Deputy Leader Hess to Britain, the "German Daily" recently published an editorial, commenting that this incident is probably a personal tragedy and will not involve the political realm. Germany still firmly believes that Hess will never violate his honor in any way, nor will he say or do anything that would harm Germany's interests. Based on this, the great illusion that Britain has about this matter will inevitably come to nothing. (Havas, May 17)</p>
<h3>Croatia: Restoration of the Kingdom; Heir to the Throne: Duke of Spoleto is Promising</h3>
<p>Milan: The Kingdom of Croatia held an important meeting on Thursday night, chaired by Head of State Dr. Pavelić, announcing the restoration of the Kingdom of Croatia. The order was broadcast on the radio and published in newspapers at the same time. The first article of the order states that the sovereignty of Croatia will be represented by the Crown of Zvonimir. The second article describes the state of the crown. The third article states that the time of the restoration of the king is from the time the order is published in the official gazette. The order was signed by the Head of State and all members of parliament. The Yugoslav newspaper commented that, according to historical records, the Kingdom of Croatia has had twelve kings in its history. At that time, the country was very prosperous, and King Zvonimir was crowned by Pope Gregory VII. (Haitong, May 17)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian well-informed sources believe that the Duke of Spoleto will be the King of Croatia. He was born in Turin on March 9, 1900. His father was the Duke of Aosta, and his mother was Princess Helen of France. His brother inherited the title of Duke of Aosta. He was ennobled as the Duke of Spoleto in 1904 and married Princess Irene of Greece in 1939. (Haitong, May 17)</p>
<h3>Turkey: Reservists Called Up</h3>
<p>Istanbul: After Turkey fell into an isolated position, it yesterday ordered the call-up of all levels of reservists from 1896 to 1916, to enter service on May 22. Those who were previously exempted from service due to official duties and physical illness will not be exempted this time. The Turkish political circles attach great importance to the fact that the current war situation has placed Turkey in an isolated position. Currently, the only transportation to Egypt is the sea route from Mersin to Alexandria. The Turkish government is improving the port facilities of Mersin, which will be used to connect American ships to and from Egypt in the future, in order to facilitate trade.

<h3>Grain: The Terror of Food for the People Is Gradually Passing The Hoarding Tigers Are Like Drowned Chickens Foreign Rice Falls and Coarse Rice Also Falls, Wanting to Escape but Without a Way The Price of Rice is Stable, and Everything is Gradually Stabilizing, Seeing the Gradual Effectiveness Moreover, a Large Amount of Foreign Rice is Still Arriving in Succession</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling rice at a fixed price, it has dealt a great blow to the big hoarders. The terror of food for the people is gradually passing. The market prices of flour and other items have also stabilized accordingly, providing beneficial assistance to the people's food supply. Although other items have not fully followed the rice market in its shift, they have also rebounded slightly at one point. It is truly said that when the price of rice is stable, everything is stable. The significance of this move by the Shanghai Municipal Council is immeasurable. Currently, the first step has been achieved at 110 yuan per stone. However, considering the living standards of the majority, it is still felt that there is a lack of capacity. It is hoped that it will gradually decrease, but the biggest key is that the rice in the mainland cannot alleviate Shanghai's food shortage, and not only Shanghai, but also cannot alleviate the needs of the mainland. If this continues, the mainland will lack rice and move it to Shanghai, Shanghai will lack rice and move it from abroad. Shanghai not only maintains the local people's food supply but also needs to supply the food needs of the occupied areas. If this phenomenon is not broken, the stability of Shanghai's food supply will never be hoped for. However, recently, since the price of rice has fallen, the public has suddenly felt a slight relief in their lives and cannot help but shout with delight. The users who were like tigers and wolves are now like drowned chickens, running away with their heads in their hands, wanting to escape but unable to do so.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's ship "Fosheng" loaded 8,070 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 4,070 bags belong to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the remaining 4,000 bags are guest rice from Juyuanhe. It arrived at the port in the evening the day before yesterday and docked at Luoqifu Wharf. It was unloaded yesterday. Yilong Company's ship "Shen'ai" arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, returning directly from Saigon with 30,000 bags of foreign rice, docking at Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng, Taikoo's Jiaying, and Yuezhou and other ships are expected to arrive at the port today, all with foreign rice loaded. There is still a large amount of foreign rice on the way and will arrive in Shanghai soon. With the source being crowded, there is hope for a continued decline in rice prices. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was once again in a slump, with a sharp drop of 6, 7, or 8 yuan compared to the previous market. Both futures and spot goods were declining in a straight line. The fixed-price measure in Hong Kong has already dealt a major blow to the market's monopoly, and the reduction in water transport costs has made it impossible for them to survive. After seeing the news reports of reduced water transport costs, general non-industry large households were all frightened and alarmed, and they were all trying to escape. Buyers were extremely rare, and the market was unable to be salvaged. Saigon No. 1 spot rice fell from 115 yuan to 109 yuan, No. 2 rice to 105 yuan, high-broken rice to 80 yuan, and final-broken rice to 70 yuan. Siam No. 2 arrival was 100 yuan, and small-broken fell from 106 yuan to 101 yuan. All other rice fell sharply, and the original bags of Yinghua Company were spit out by large households, making the market even softer. Broken rice fell below the 100 yuan mark, as low as 94 or 95 yuan, and small-broken fell to 127 yuan in one drop. Saigon No. 1 fell from 135 yuan to 132 yuan, a drop of 6, 7, or 8 yuan compared to the day before. However, the cargo owners in the later market could not bear to sell cheaply again, and some local merchants also took the opportunity to inquire about the price, so the price was seen to rise by 1 or 2 yuan in the afternoon. A total of 4,021 bags of foreign rice were traded throughout the day, and more than 800 tons of original bags.</p>
<p>The arrival of thick, thin, glutinous and other domestic rice is still sparse. The cargo owners are still insisting, and there is no change in the market cry. However, the subsequent sharp decline in foreign rice, with intermediate goods falling close to 100 yuan, has affected the market, and most of the local merchants have stopped trading. The cargo owners had no way to do anything, and their willingness to sell has relaxed, and a falling wind has also risen for a moment, and it has fallen by 5 or 6 yuan in an instant. As a result, the price of thick rice, except for Wuxi Qing special rice, is still opening at 135 yuan, Kunshan white rice is only 132 or 3 yuan to 130 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice is only 127 yuan. The original bags in Zhongguan are also only 131 or 2 yuan to 128 yuan. Glutinous rice is tracking straight down in this environment, and the destination is subtle, which feels lacking in spirit. The Hong Kong white yuan opened at 108 or 9 yuan, and fell by a huge 5 or 6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour is Going Downhill - Cheaper Than Fixed Price Flour -</h3>
<p>The current market situation of foreign flour is that the falling wind is getting stronger and stronger. Due to the impact of the sharp drop in rice prices and the news of increased wharf rent, it is under heavy pressure, and people's hearts are tired and unable to rise. Local merchants' actual sales are even more deserted. Internal and external hoarding households and floating vendors are all devaluing and selling, so the market is going downhill. Jinlong brand "Kan" flour fell below the 29 yuan mark, and the later market only opened at 28 yuan and 5 or 6 cents, and there is still a lack of wholesale buyers. "Paotai" flour is also only opening at 29 yuan and 1 cent to 29 yuan, which is cheaper than the fixed-price flour, and it is more than 1 yuan less than the previous day, and its falling momentum can also be said to be fierce.</p>
<p>The market situation of wheat is becoming more and more sluggish, because the supply and demand in the market have long been silent, and the occasional remaining old wheat is mostly directly distributed to factories, and its price is also getting lower and lower. At present, all flour mills have stopped trading in raw materials and are waiting for the new wheat to be available before buying it.</p>
<h3>Oilcake - Soybean Cake Compensates for Short Covering and Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes was still tired in the morning, so various transactions were sparse, and the corn futures continued to fall by 2 yuan, while the soybean cake futures fell by 2 or 3 cents. The opening in the afternoon was still the same, but later, stimulated by rumors, the shorts were timid, causing the futures cakes to cover the short positions, and the trading was frequent first, and the corn was also pulled up, and the prices rose again. The futures cakes were really upright, and as a result, they rose sharply by 5 or 6 cents compared to the previous day. The spot sales market is still ordinary. It is calculated that 1,000 pieces of Shengji spot cakes are priced at 18 yuan and 6 cents, and more than 50,000 pieces of futures cakes are priced at 20 yuan and 2 cents for delivery on May 20, and the price for delivery from the end of May to the beginning of June fell from 20 yuan and 4 and a half cents to 2 cents, and then rose sharply again to 21 yuan. Other transactions included 1,000 pieces of Yuanyi spot cakes, priced at 18 yuan, and 1 truck of Feizi spot cakes, priced at 18 yuan and 5 cents. Although the corn has recovered, it is still less than a yuan compared to the previous day, and a total of 3,5600 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany by Feng Liutang: Banks (1)</h3>
<p>In Chinese commerce, a large business is often called a “行” (háng, pronounced 'hang'). The name “行” existed as early as the Tang Dynasty. When trade began with the West, the places where business was done with foreigners were called “洋行” (yángháng, pronounced 'yahng-hang', foreign firms). Around the reigns of the Qianlong and Jiaqing Emperors, it seems that "洋商" (yángshāng, pronounced 'yahng-shahng', foreign merchant) was a general term for merchants from foreign firms, not limited to foreigners. While "夷商" (yíshāng, pronounced 'ee-shahng', barbarian merchant) specifically referred to foreigners. This point will be further discussed in the future when talking about Chinese commercial names (such as 行, 號, 店, 舖, 廠, 局, 莊, 棧, 作, 坊, 園, 場, 館, 社, 公司, etc.). Since the business places of foreigners were called "洋行," and their main business involved silver transactions, unlike the Chinese "錢號" (qiánhào, pronounced 'chyen-hao', silver shops), "錢莊" (qiánzhuāng, pronounced 'chyen-zhwahn', native banks), and "錢行" (qiánháng, pronounced 'chyen-hang', money exchanges) that dealt with cash, these foreign firms were named "銀行" (yínháng, pronounced 'yin-hang', silver bank), hence the origin of the term "bank."</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the first to use the term "銀行" (Bank) was the British Chartered Bank of India, Australia &amp; China. The bank, located in Hong Kong, was called the Standard Chartered Bank, with "渣打" (zhādǎ, pronounced 'jah-dah') being a transliteration of "Chartered." "Chartered" means "specially authorized," implying that the bank was specially authorized by the British Royal Family. But why was the bank in Shanghai also called "麥加利" (Màijiālì, pronounced 'my-jah-lee', McCallum)? This was because it was named after a person. It is said that the foreign manager who came to Shanghai to establish the branch was named McCallum. The Shanghainese only knew him as McCallum, and thus called the bank McCallum as well. Over time, "麥加利銀行" became its established name.</p>
<p>The Chartered Bank (麥加利銀行) opened in 1853 AD, the third year of the Xianfeng Emperor’s reign. Its headquarters was located in London, less than ten years after Shanghai was established as a foreign concession. At that time, the British, with their victorious might, wanted to firmly establish their power in China. In the seventh year of Xianfeng (1857 AD), British and French allied forces entered Guangzhou and captured the Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi, Ye Mingchen. The Chartered Bank (麥加利銀行) opened in Shanghai in the same year, so it has been 85 years to this day (1941).</p>
<p>At that time, the European powers vying for dominance in the Far East were Britain, France, and Russia. In 1859 (the ninth year of Xianfeng), the French occupied Saigon. In 1862 (the first year of Tongzhi), Vietnam ceded Cochinchina to France. In China, after the British and French allied forces entered Beijing and resolved the Treaties of Tianjin, the French, in order to expand their economic power in China, also came to Shanghai to establish the Banque de l'Indochine (法蘭西銀行). This happened in the third year of Tongzhi (1864 AD), at the location where the Banque de l'Indochine (東方滙理銀行) now stands on the Bund (外灘) on Beijing Road. The first foreign manager was Haugson, and the Chinese manager was Song Shusheng. Song was fluent in Latin and French, and was loyal and capable, so he served as the Chinese manager for the rest of his life. Not long after Song passed away in the twentieth year of Guangxu (1894 AD), the Russo-Chinese Bank (華俄道勝銀行) was established and acquired the business of the Banque de l'Indochine.</p>
<p>Established in Shanghai after the Banque de l'Indochine was the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (滙豐銀行), which opened in the third year of Tongzhi (1864 AD). It was initially a joint venture organized by British, American, German, Chinese, and Persian merchants. Later, dissatisfied with the actions of the British, the American, German, and Persian shareholders withdrew, and it became a British bank. It came to Shanghai to establish a branch in the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867 AD). Although it and the Chartered Bank were both commercial banks, one can tell from its English name that it was a bank for the British to develop colonial enterprises in the Far East.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War in the Guangxu Jiawu year (1894), the Chinese people became aware of the inadequacy of national strength and began to think about developing industry to strengthen the country. Railway and mining loans became the focus of attention for both the government and the public. In the twenty-second year of Guangxu, Zhang Zhidong and Wang Wenshao requested the establishment of a Railway General Corporation and recommended Sheng Xuanhuai as its Director-General. At that time, Sheng was the Customs Taotai of Tianjin. He was promoted to a Fourth-Rank Imperial Official and appointed to oversee the affairs of the Railway General Corporation. Sheng then submitted a memorial proposing: (1) implementing a conscription system; (2) abolishing the likin tax and increasing the customs duty to ten percent; (3) issuing stamp duties; (4) establishing a bank to resist foreign banks; and (5) establishing a Silver Dollar General Bureau in Beijing to mint one-tael silver coins with 85% silver content. At that time, the Ministry of Revenue deliberated and ordered Sheng Xuanhuai to prepare for the establishment of the Bank of China, with a capital of five million taels. After the bank was established, it was permitted to mint one-tael silver coins, at a rate of one hundred thousand taels. It was to be first tested in the southern provinces. If it could circulate without any obstacles, then a detailed charter would be drafted and implemented. This is the origin of the establishment of the Imperial Bank of China (中國通商銀行).</p>
<p>In the fifth month of the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu, Sheng Xuanhuai, Vice Minister of the Court of Judicature, presented a memorial detailing the progress of establishing the Imperial Bank of China:</p>
<p>"The Bank of China has gathered gentry and merchants, and prepared the capital stock. Following the charter of Western banks, the Shanghai Head Office was opened on April 26th of the twenty-third year of Guangxu (1898 AD). From summer to winter, branches have been successively opened in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Yantai, Zhenjiang, and other places. The Beijing Bank was also opened last year. Branches should also be gradually established in the capitals of various provinces. In recent years, the price of gold pounds has soared, while silver coins have depreciated. In Shanghai, the center of international commerce, there is a shortage of silver, and business conditions are precarious, facing daily crises. Fortunately, the Imperial Bank of China has been managing the market, and although the interest rate on silver is high, it is still limited, which allows us to barely maintain stability. The Imperial Bank of China is in its early stages, so its contribution to commerce will come gradually. Moreover, foreign banks in China, such as HSBC, have been established for more than thirty years, with deep roots. Not only do they handle all transactions of foreign merchants, but they have also established long-term relationships with Chinese merchants for large-scale trade, enjoying their deep trust. The Imperial Bank of China is newly established, with insufficient strength, so it cannot immediately compete with Westerners. Therefore, the original plan was to be cautious at the beginning and strive for eventual success, accumulating small gains to achieve great things. Now, after one year of establishment, a good foundation has been laid. From now on, expanding the commercial interests of China and recovering our own rights and interests depends on whether the official funds allocated in Beijing and elsewhere are all managed by the Imperial Bank of China. If the official funds stored and transferred by various provinces still follow the old practices, exclusively entrusted to private silver shops, and have nothing to do with the bank established by imperial decree, then the system of commercial governance will be completely lost. Westerners will laugh at us, Chinese will become more suspicious, and who would be willing to trust us? This is not a small matter concerning the overall commercial situation. Therefore, I respectfully request that the Ministry of Revenue be ordered to notify all provincial customs offices that, from now on, wherever there is an Imperial Bank of China, all official funds stored and transferred must be uniformly entrusted to the bank for safekeeping and remittance, in accordance with the proper procedures."</p>

<h3>Financial and Foreign Exchange: Empty Account Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC quote prices, but various exchange rates remained unchanged. The unofficial British-American market was quite stable. Only the month-end U.S. dollar exchange rate shifted from loose to flat due to the covering of short positions by the Chinese banks and speculators. Foreign firms like Fumei Bank suspended their intention to supply, resulting in the June delivery U.S. dollar rate of $5.375 suddenly becoming difficult to close at the afternoon session. Eventually, both spot and June delivery rates were at $5.34375, and the silver exchange rate at 32.8125, unchanged from the previous day's closing price. Trading during the half-day session was not quiet. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Trading is Not Quiet</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign wire reports indicated that the silver market saw reductions in the near and long term. The American silver market did not change, while the Indian silver market recovered. Exchange rates in various countries remained unchanged. The central exchange rate postings were all flat. At the opening of the domestic market, banks offered spot British exchange at 32.8125 and U.S. dollars at $5.34375, with June delivery at $5.375. Foreign banks showed some intention to supply, and speculators gradually covered their positions. HSBC's postings showed no change in various exchange rates. The silver balancing tax recovered by .25 to 24.5. Chinese banks also bought into the June $5.375. Chinese speculators also bought in, in significant quantities. Therefore, at noon, it was still difficult to close at the above price. Seeing a slight softening, at the noon closing, the spot and June delivery rates were both at the previous day's closing prices: British exchange at 32.8125 and U.S. dollars at $5.34375.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Falls</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 17th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened stable this morning. The spot Shanghai exchange rate alone fell by 50 cents to $456.50 (previous closing was $457). The spot U.S. dollar exchange rate closed at $24.50 yesterday. No other changes. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Unchanged</p>
<p>Tianjin, 17th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London and New York telegraphic transfers remained unchanged. The exchange rates also remained at the original levels. Only the unofficial "Lianchao" (聯鈔, paper currency issued by the United Allied Banks in Tianjin during the Boxer Rebellion) rate was cheaper by $1.25 to $54.</p>
<h3>Scattered Shorts Compete to Cover: Gold Market Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market in the informal market rose sharply. The hearts of those who were short-selling were wavering. The far-month U.S. dollar exchange rate shifted from loose to flat. Securities firms aggressively covered their short positions. Tongkang Yong and others increased their positions significantly. Gold shops like Cheng Ji, Xin Yuan, Shi He, etc., engaged in back-and-forth buying and absorbing. Because there were too many retail shorts, seeing the trend was unstoppable, they started to cover their positions aggressively. As a result, the price rose from $6,437 to $6,463 at noon, a rise of $21. After the market closed, it was pushed up to around $6,480. Trading during the half-day session totaled 30,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday, and there were no reports of after-hours trading. For the rollover (May rolling into June), sellers were willing to offer a $55 discount, but there were no transactions. Yifeng, Chengda, and Yongcheng each had 50 taels of cash, while Tongkang, Yong, Chengda had 90 taels, all at $220 higher than the futures price, an increase of $10 from the previous day. Jewelry gold and customs gold were both flat.</p>
<p>Futures Recovered by $21</p>
<p>The June futures market opened at 9:15 AM at $6,445, $3 lower than the previous day's closing price. Zhongxing, Xinfeng Yong, and Xianghe sold, falling to $6,437. Cheng Ji, Xin Yuan, Yi Da, and Lianxing bought in. Hearing that the June U.S. dollar rate of $5.375 was difficult to close, they pushed it up by $25 to $6,462, prompting Xinfeng Yong to sell. Defu and Shun Yuan also sold, gradually reducing it to $6,440. Tongkang Yong, Yifeng, Dafeng, Yi Da, and Shi He competed to buy, immediately pushing up the price. At noon, Xinfeng Shui re-entered, and the price rose straight to $6,463 at the noon closing, a recovery of $21 from the previous day's closing price. Calculated at the June U.S. dollar closing price, it was $6,516.96, a premium of $53.96. After the market closed, Yi Da and others aggressively bought again, pushing it up to $6,483, and finally to $6,478. During the morning session (excluding after-hours trading), the difference was only $26. The selling price of gold from cash shops was $230 higher than the informal futures price, while the buying price was $60 lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops, both Datong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, remained at $690, with a discount of $40 for buying back, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Gains Were Very Small</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slight gains in the informal market. British and American gold pounds each rose by $1. The British gold note remained stable. The U.S. gold note slightly increased by 4 cents to $18.33 in the evening market. The Hong Kong note remained unchanged at $4.70 in the evening market. The Japanese gold note slightly weakened to $2.07 in the evening market. The Korean note had balanced supply and demand and remained flat at $1.78 in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower: Double Horse Had a Short Squeeze, and the Market Price Steadily Increased</h3>
<p>The yarn market recovered and rose, but the trend was erratic because actual transactions were very slow. Hong Kong firms only traded in coarse yarn, and there was significant demand for 20-count yarn. Therefore, securities firms and gold shops mostly tended to sell. As a result, the bulls among general large clients not only did not release their positions, but instead dragged them in and added more. Their intention was that there was a lack of factory orders, and selling short meant that there were no warehouse receipts to deliver, creating the appearance of a short squeeze. As a result, the atmosphere in the market tightened slightly, and the market price rose. If the opposite were to happen, it would quickly fall. Currently, in terms of the general trend, the market cannot rise significantly, but behind-the-scenes manipulation is also difficult to determine. The fundamental problem is that real demand is too slow. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,484, and the low price was $1,465. There was no market in the afternoon due to the weekend. Some said it was $1,487, and some wanted to buy in.</p>
<p>The Double Horse market opened this morning with an ordinary attitude. The opening price was $1,470. Shortly after, it fell to $1,465. Then, with gold prices flat, those on the trading floor reached out to buy in, gradually rising to $1,475. But with slow sales in the existing yarn market, it loosened again to $1,465. Around noon, some large shorts came to cover, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. The market price gradually increased, rising to $1,484 at the close. The statistics for half-day transactions showed that 9,645 bales were traded. The amount of purchases by each firm is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 145; Tong Hang 9; 500; Statistics 9; 6845</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Ordinary</h3>
<p>The current cotton cloth situation is ordinary. This is because factories are not opening. Chinese factories, because the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is cheap at over one hundred yuan, are paying only mild attention to high-priced raw materials. As for foreign factories, most of them ship directly themselves and do not need to buy from flower shops. Therefore, although morale is good, transactions are not robust. The price of 200, 5-label, 300-piece Indian special is announced separately upon warehouse delivery. In the cotton transactions of foreign firms, the market situation is quite lively and firm, but because those holding goods are hoarding, they are unwilling to easily sell. At the same time, the factories are also not in a stable situation, and the yarn market is hovering without any intention to purchase. Therefore, the number of transactions remains sparse and irregular.</p>
<p>New York cotton cloth, first rose due to purchases by fellow traders and political news from Washington that President Roosevelt would approve the loan agreement. Later, it fell slightly due to profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was 7-8 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Another telegram stated that, from August 1 of last year to May 16 of this year, the U.S. cotton record is as follows (each bale is 500 pounds):</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first fell due to sales by cotton merchants, but then recovered due to active short covering and strong support from buyers. Yesterday's closing prices, except for the May contract of White Luo, which fell by 7 rupees, the rest rose by 2 to 8 rupees.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that today's opening market situation will be lower by 1 rupee.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Waits for its Moment</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds was slightly volatile, small at first and then larger, but ultimately remained small. It was visible that someone was bidding up the price when it was low, and someone was selling when it was high. Most of the existing unfinished transactions were still waiting for their moment. Transactions were only done in the morning session. At the opening, Le Mao offered to sell at a small discount of 1 or 2 cents, followed by Lian He buying in. Following this, Yichang Shuntai. The "C" type bonds were bid up by 6 yuan. Then, Xie Kang Lianyi continued to sell, although Yixing still bought in, but the momentum was already at its end. The "C" type bonds then entered the 6 yuan range. Morale was not rising. There were many instances of entering and exiting the 6 yuan range, but the price could not be fixed. The outlook remains very subtle. As a result, the price continued to be slightly lower by 5 to 20 cents. The transaction volume was 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is provided below.</p>
<p>For stock transactions, 700 shares of Greater China Match Company were traded at a price of $33.75.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Friday) dispatch: The listed prices of Chinese foreign values and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Only HSBC's London-registered shares continued to rise by half a pound to 73 pounds. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: South Seas Cloth Sales Were Particularly Brisk</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday and people were relaxed, with most adopting a wait-and-see attitude, so transactions were very slow. Sales to Hong Kong firms and foreign firms were particularly brisk. The cloth of British firms Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang were the most firm because there was a large volume of exports to the South Seas. The coarse twill of domestic factories was also popular, while other cloth was ordinary. Over 200 pieces of khaki drill were transacted on Mumu Street. Cantonese, Hong Kong, and South Seas firms transacted over 300 pieces of coarse cloth and twill bleached and dyed cloth produced by Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang factories. About 200 pieces of products such as Huafeng blue cloth, Dasing colored twill, and Datong coarse twill from domestic factories.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the East cloth market continued to fall by 30-40 cents in exchange-traded cloth, and people's minds were more empty. The closing price for white goods Longtou fine cloth factory spot goods was $47.75, also down 30 cents. Colored goods Sijunzi serge $1.485, down 5 cents. The market atmosphere was very weak.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Recover and Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend turned soft and was frustrated again, and spot coarse white sugar felt even weaker. Futures were relatively stable, and the result was only a small loss of four corners. The Guild priced spot 24 coarse white sugar, foreign warehouse old goods $104.70. The May 20th futures fluctuated by only a few corners in the end. In the morning: $106.60, $106.40, $106.30, $106.10, $106.60, $106.10, $106.20, $106.30, $106.40, $106.20. In the afternoon: $106.65, $106.80, $106.90, and then closed at $106.50. At the end of May, the morning futures were at $107.60, $107.40, $107.80, $107.78, $107.50, $107.30, $107.65, $107.30. In the afternoon, the sugar was at $107.80, $107.90, $108.10, $108.30, $108.50, $108.30, $108.10, $108.00, $107.95, $108.00. There was a slight loss of four corners. Dutch red sugar: $84, down $1. Taikoo car white B mark: $111, up $1. New DY mark goods remained at $101. New XH mark west warehouse goods $98, all were in line with expectations.</p>
<h3>Coal: Helin White Coal Dust Rises and Then Falls</h3>
<p>Helin white coal dust, due to the intentional closure of the goods side a month ago, the spot chips on the market suddenly became scarce. Fellow traders split prices, and unofficial prices once rose to more than 240 yuan. Then, they took the opportunity to sell at high prices, with a slight outflow. Buyers also considered the source to be very strong and watched from the sidelines. Therefore, it fell back after a clear rise. Yesterday, the opening price of coal dust was 230 yuan per ton, self-shipped from the warehouse, with commissions added outside the line. It was heard that the market had fallen back close to 20 yuan compared with the previous week.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: A Large Batch of Fresh Eggs Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large batch of fresh eggs was shipped from Tianjin, totaling 6,100 baskets. Yesterday, soybeans also came from Tianjin. On the 18th, there were 70 bags of soybeans exported to Hong Kong, 550 bags to Singapore, 500 pieces of soybean cake to Hong Kong, 45 pieces of tea to Singapore, 150 pieces of piece goods to Hong Kong, 225 pieces to Singapore, and 95 pieces of cotton yarn to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Opening Price of American Narrow Strip Steel Also Drops</h3>
<p>The American narrow strip steel market was not vibrant under the trend of various goods fluctuating. It was difficult for the customer market to invigorate. In addition, local toy factories, cigarette companies, canneries, printing plants, etc., were also not very enthusiastic about purchasing. Although the market did not appear bleak, it was also difficult to show a vigorous atmosphere. Therefore, fellow traders had ordinary thoughts, and the opening price fell slightly. Yesterday, each box of 200 pounds was sold for 320 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>U.S.-China Trade: 150 Years</p>
<p>The beginning of U.S. trade with China dates back to 1785, when the "Empress of China" first came to Guangzhou from the United States, completed its trade mission, and returned to New York, which is 156 years ago. In 1786, the United States sent its first consul to Guangzhou. In 1830, American missionaries began to come to China. In 1840, the Pan American Era Wheel first sailed to China. In 1843, the United States sent its first ambassador to China. In 1844, the United States began to conclude trade agreements with China. In 1852, $180,000,000 in U.S. dollars from 1784 to 1852 was loaded onto wheels and transported to China.

<h3>Frequent Bombing Incidents on Trains: Japanese Plan to Erect Electric Fences Extending Five Miles Eastward from Suzhou; Japanese Soldiers Stationed Along the Line Fail to Prevent Incidents</h3>
<h3>Over Fourteen Sections of Train Derailed in the Bombing Incident the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>It has been learned that the Japanese Army is planning to erect electric fences along the railway extending five miles eastward from Suzhou, where the second train bombing in two weeks occurred near Suzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing line on the morning of the 16th (as reported in yesterday's newspaper).</p>
<h3>Incident Location: At Huxuguan</h3>
<p>According to passengers arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing, the explosion occurred at Huxuguan, a small station west of Suzhou. A freight train bound for Shanghai was bombed, and the engine and fourteen freight cars derailed. It is believed that guerrillas planted a landmine on the tracks, causing the explosion.</p>
<h3>Large Cranes Used to Lift Overturned Cars</h3>
<p>The work of clearing the tracks was not completed until 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. Passengers traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai in the afternoon had to disembark at the site of the explosion, walk along the tracks for about a mile, and then board the train waiting at the other end to reach Shanghai. The passengers said that they saw large cranes mounted on flatbed cars trying to lift the overturned train cars back onto the tracks.</p>
<h3>Train Bombing Incidents Continue to Occur</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Japanese Army has decided to erect electric fences along various sections of the railway in order to deter guerrilla attacks on the railway. Although this explosion occurred west of Suzhou, the areas repeatedly bombed are within the five-mile stretch east of Suzhou. It is reported that the Japanese side will use electric fences to protect this section and other locations. Over the past three months, the Japanese army has built defense posts at various railway bridges and stationed soldiers along the railway, but incidents of guerrillas bombing railways and attacking sentries continue to occur.</p>
<h3>Plan to Erect Electric Fences and Energize Them</h3>
<p>The electric fences that the Japanese army plans to erect will consist of four strands of electric wire woven into a barrier, about four feet high, placed along both sides of the railway. The current will be turned on at night. Yesterday, Japanese officials here stated regarding the bombing of the Shanghai-Nanjing line by guerrillas that at 3:10 AM the day before yesterday, a freight train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line was passing through Suzhou when a landmine exploded, causing the engine and five cars to derail. Only one mechanic on board was injured. Traffic on the line was restored eight hours later. However, the Japanese military authorities searched the area for guerrillas but found nothing.</p>

<h3>Martyr Chen Ying Shi Memorialized: Shanghai Circles Mournfully Commemorate</h3>
<p>Today is the memorial day for the martyr Mr. Chen Ying Shi. All circles in Shanghai originally planned to hold a solemn commemoration today. However, after the central government stipulated that this memorial day be combined with the March 29th Revolution Memorial, and due to the special circumstances, it was decided to follow the central government's decree and not hold separate commemorative ceremonies. However, in order to commemorate the martyr's great achievements in devoting himself to the national revolution, it was decided to silently mourn today, inheriting the martyr's legacy and making its great promotion one's own responsibility. The police authorities of the two concessions, because it was the anniversary of the revolution, were sincerely worried that unscrupulous elements would cause trouble within the boundaries, so they implemented a joint alert for one day, prohibiting illegal gatherings and other activities, and dispatched detectives to strengthen necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the concessions.</p>
<h3>Tongren Fuyuantang Eagerly Awaits Assistance: Prices of Coffin Boards Are Steadily Rising; Maintain Charitable Deeds by Enthusiastically Contributing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tongren Fuyuantang's sole mission is to provide coffins and burials for deceased bodies found on the streets in Nanshi, western Shanghai, and the French Concession. Due to financial exhaustion, it faces many difficult situations. Since this newspaper published a report on the current situation, donations have slightly increased, including 200 yuan from Duzhenji, 100 yuan from Xi Yaoru, 10 yuan from Ms. Yang Fengying, 5 yuan from Chen Naizao, 500 yuan from Pengshoutang, 200 yuan from an anonymous donor, 400 yuan from [Surname] Liu, 5 yuan from Yu Ningkun, 30 yuan from Pan Shaoji, 100 yuan from [Surname] [Unclear] from Gansu Province, 20 yuan from Granny Zi, 20 yuan from Zi Zipei, and 500 yuan from Zhang Zhixing of Yutai Hardware Store. All of these have been received by the hall and will be publicly acknowledged in the newspaper in early June. However, with the recent steady rise in the price of coffin boards and the large expenditures, it is hoped that the great philanthropists of Shanghai will continue to generously donate and assist, so as to maintain the current situation, which will not only benefit the poor but also provide practical benefits to the local area.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Goods Carried by Passengers to Singapore: Several People Fined for Carrying Special Items</h3>
<p>As the situation in the Far East gradually intensifies, the United States and Britain are making every effort to defend the Far East. Singapore has very strict restrictions on imports and exports. Recently, when the "Wan Fushi" (transliteration) ship arrived in Singapore, a female passenger carrying several pieces of clothing, several pairs of leather shoes, and five or six leather handbags, all of which were used goods, was fined 100 Canadian dollars and had all the items confiscated. Another man carrying several notebooks of stationery, several bundles of envelopes, more than ten pieces of medicine, and more than ten tins of biscuits was also subjected to the same punishment. Therefore, passengers traveling to Singapore should only carry items for personal use to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<h3>Young British Nationals in Shanghai Enthusiastically Enlisting: Authorities Will Not Prevent Non-British Subjects from Enlisting</h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, appealed to British nationals to enlist on Thursday of last week, stating that defending Britain is now more important than doing business in Shanghai. This appeal has triggered an automatic response among young British nationals. According to Major Wallace, the British recruiting officer in Shanghai, fourteen people have already left Shanghai or will depart soon for Malaya to join the army, and the number of those responding to the ambassador's appeal is continuously increasing, far exceeding the usual rate. Those who enlist are all British nationals. Non-British subjects who wish to join the British army will not be prevented, but it is not yet determined whether their applications will be accepted.</p>

<h3>Labor Strikes Continue in Various Industries, Still Awaiting Negotiations: Boycott at Tongyanchun Chinese Medicine Store; Workers at Junpu Bureau Raise Demands</h3>
<p>Labor-management disputes once occurred in the Chinese medicine industry, but were resolved amicably after repeated consultations between representatives of both parties, with a universal salary increase of 140% and a subsidy of 70%, thus avoiding a labor strike. At the same time, the employers also increased the price of medicines by 20%.</p>
<h3>Tongyanchun</h3>
<p>Recently, several Chinese medicine stores such as Tongyanchun on North Nicheng Bridge, although they have increased the price of medicines since the dispute was resolved, intended to provide additional subsidies instead of complying with the agreed-upon salary increase method, which caused dissatisfaction among employees. They implemented a boycott on the 15th and left the store, demanding salaries be paid according to the aforementioned method. The store hired replacements and requested the police station to send detectives for protection. Therefore, business continues under police protection. At 1:00 PM yesterday, an apprentice from the medicine store was delivering medicine when he was attacked by several employees waiting there on Baker Road. Fortunately, a Chinese constable on duty nearby arrived and arrested seven people on the spot for questioning at the police station. In addition, a similar boycott occurred at Fusheng Hall Chinese Medicine Store on Kaizi'er Road. After the employer stated that it would implement the agreed-upon method, the employees were stabilized and resumed work that day.</p>
<h3>Junpu Bureau</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that an official of the Junpu Bureau denied this morning (the 17th) that 800 workers of the bureau had gone on strike, resulting in the cessation of dredging work on the Huangpu River. It is claimed that the workers only requested an increase in wages and rice subsidies and did not go on strike. It is heard that the bureau and worker representatives are currently negotiating and a resolution is expected soon.</p>
<h3>Sullivan</h3>
<p>Due to the dismissal of four employees by the employer, all employees of the Sullivan Confectionery Company on Nanjing Road in this city were dissatisfied and announced a joint strike with employees of the Jing'an Temple Road and Petain Road branches, starting a few days ago. The situation remained deadlocked yesterday, and all employees were appealing to relevant authorities for assistance. The employer is still insisting on the principle of layoffs and has not expressed any response to the demands raised by the employees. However, the retail department is still trying to operate. To prevent accidents, police officers were stationed in front of the main store on Nanjing Road yesterday for protection.</p>
<h3>Rice from Hong Kong Has Been Released for Sale Yesterday: Rice Prices Are Declining Rapidly; Xiaojiaomi Rice is Actually 8 Yuan Cheaper than the Flat Price; Shipping Costs Are Expected to Be Reduced Again, Futures are Even Cheaper</h3>
<p>Starting yesterday morning, rice stores rushed to the Roosevelt Warehouse to pick up the rice from Hong Kong managed by the Public Works Department. By last night, about eight out of ten of the city's 800 rice stores had sold this foreign rice. According to the survey, the reason why more than one hundred stores failed to sell Hong Kong rice was mainly because they had not yet completed the payment and bill of lading procedures with Xiangmao Foreign Firm. By tomorrow at the latest, all rice stores in the city should be able to sell rice managed by the Public Works Department. According to statistics, the total number of bills of lading issued by the firm in three days is about 20,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>After the rice market opened yesterday, most of the rice stores went to the Roosevelt and Taikoo warehouses to pick up the foreign rice managed by the Public Works Department. Yesterday, the foreign rice was officially sold in the rice stores, and sales were greatly impacted. Although the shipping cost of rice from Shanghai to Yangxian has plummeted from 90 yuan per bag to 50 yuan, the previous surge in water feet was very unreasonable. Therefore, it is noted that the freight rate may continue to fall to 100 shillings per ton, and rice prices will continue to decline. Yesterday, the hoarding households were very panicked, and the price of each stone of rice quickly fell by 6 yuan. Saigon No. 1 has plummeted from 117 yuan to 111 yuan. The selling price of Yangon 40-grain Xiaojiaomi rice is 102 yuan, which is 8 yuan cheaper than the Public Works Department's flat-price rice, which shows the previous ruthlessness.</p>
<h3>Futures are Even Cheaper</h3>
<p>At present, rice shops that have ordered rice from Liji Foreign Firm have suspended delivery due to the continued drop in rice prices. Therefore, only dozens of companies went to Xiangmao Foreign Firm to pay yesterday, which is very different from the day before. The firm's proposal to work normally on Sunday was also cancelled as a result. Since the water feet from Shanghai to Yangxian have been reduced, the cost of shipping Hong Kong rice to Shanghai will be even lower in the future. It is reported that Dafu Foreign Firm at 181 Jiangxi Road sold 5,000 bags of Yangon Xiaojiaomi rice for June delivery yesterday, at a price of 128 yuan per bag, which is 5.5 yuan lower than the current price of the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>One Batch of Rice Arrived</h3>
<p>The Rangoon strained rice purchased by the Public Works Department continues to arrive, as repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is learned that on the evening of the 16th, the Yige Foreign Firm's Fusheng ship, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, brought 8,010 bags of foreign rice, of which 4,070 bags were also the foreign rice purchased by the Public Works Department. Today, the Taikoo Company's Jiaying, Yuezhou ships, and Yige Foreign Firm's Yusheng ships, etc., all have foreign rice loaded. The G.G.A-VARENNE, managed by Hualun Foreign Firm, directly transported rice from Saigon to Shanghai. Due to damage to the machine parts en route, it is currently being repaired in Hong Kong and is expected to be completed and arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month. In addition, the ALBERT SARRAUT ship is also carrying rice from Saigon to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port next Tuesday. According to the firm, the large amount of foreign rice loaded by the two French ships is Hakka goods and has nothing to do with the French Public Works Bureau. In addition, the rice purchased by the French Public Works Bureau is generally transported by ships of the French Postal Shipping Company. The General Xiafei postal ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month. There will be a large amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai this month, so there is hope that rice prices will continue to decline.</p>
<h3>The Army Negotiated</h3>
<p>After the strike of the rice cart workers was mediated by the authorities and resumed work, the labor and management reached an agreement yesterday in the Public Works Department, jointly signed by the rice shops, trucks, and carts. The cart workers decided on a method after a meeting yesterday, which roughly included: (1) Rice shops with cart leaders will maintain their previous practices, otherwise one person will be elected by the cart workers to lead; (2) To prevent rice grabbing, fences will be added to the carts; (3) An eight-person supervision team will be organized to take care of the rice, loading, and unloading at each warehouse to prevent losses; (4) Certificates will be issued for all rice transported to identify it. The cart representative will be responsible for any unauthorized removal, and will not be responsible without a certificate; (5) Small amounts and nearby rice will be transported by carts, and large quantities will be allocated according to the 40% standard. The above measures will be submitted at the appropriate time.</p>

<h3>How Should We Respect Our Teachers?</h3>
<p>— Xie Xia</p>
<p>The people we love most are, of course, our parents, and next are our teachers. Because the love between parents and children is mostly innate, while the love between teachers and students is mostly based on emotion. Teachers diligently teach us in the classroom every day, so we should listen attentively. If we don't listen attentively, the teacher will definitely feel unhappy.</p>
<p>Since teachers are so enthusiastic in teaching us, we must also respect them. But how do we respect them? At our age, we can't talk about repaying them, but we should practice the following points:</p>
<p>(1) We should be polite to teachers at all times.</p>
<p>(2) We should listen carefully when teachers are explaining, and not disappoint them.</p>
<p>(3) We must obey what the teachers tell us to do, because the teachers never tell us to do bad things.</p>
<p>We can all do the above points. On the one hand, it can be considered respecting the teacher, and on the other hand, it can be said to be repaying the teacher!</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Small Things Too</h3>
<p>— Zhiru</p>
<p>In a large factory, many people are working. They are building a ship. The hull of the ship has been built. Suddenly, they found a termite in a large piece of wood, only half an inch long. "This piece of wood already has termites, should we put it inside?" We think maybe we can, because it won't be seen by others." Another group of workers thought that this small termite was nothing to worry about. So everyone casually put it down. Although there were three or four people who said that termites would grow bigger and bigger, no one paid attention. Finally, this slightly termite-infested piece of wood was put down, and the ship was built.</p>
<p>In the midst of melodious music, the ship was launched. For ten years, it sailed smoothly at sea, but the beginning of the eleventh year was also the beginning of its insecurity: the piece of wood with termites was almost completely eaten, and the ship gradually became unable to function.</p>
<p>When the shipowner discovered this in the cabin, he was very worried. He silently asked God to bless the ship to reach the shore safely, because the ship was carrying many people and precious silk.</p>
<p>A violent storm suddenly rose on the sea. The ship swayed in the storm and gradually tilted. There was a large gap in the ship, and the surging seawater poured in. Although there were two huge water pumps, everyone worked hard to pump. But the water kept rushing in.</p>
<p>There was no time to launch the lifeboats, and the ship was already full of water. In an instant, the violent waves swallowed it. Only scattered pieces of wood and corpses floated on the sea. Yes, the precious silk was gone, not to mention the lives of people.</p>
<p>Did the wind, rain, and waves harm those goods and people? No. Was it that the people on the ship were not united or diligent and harmed themselves? No. It was only that the workers in the factory were careless and put the termite-infested wood in when building the ship, which caused a great disaster.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay attention to small things at all times, and pay special attention to small things!</p>
<p>The Meaning of "?" — Yi Jing</p>
<p>"?" is a symbol that expresses a question. When we meet him in books, he always stands humbly behind each sentence, as if he is just an unknown soldier with not much value. In fact, the value of this "?" Mr. is something we can't imagine! Why? Because "?" is the starting point of thought and the original driving force for the evolution of all things in the universe. From the time a person comes out of the womb until death, the closest teacher is this "?" Mr.. He can raise doubts with you and gain rich experience and knowledge. In ancient times, this "?" Mr. was also very busy. He stirred Newton's heart, causing Newton to discover the great theorem of gravity on a small apple; he also stirred Edison's heart, giving us the bright electric lights and all things electrical that we have now. "?" Mr. is still continuing to lead the world's civilization forward, step by step, into the bright zone. How great is his power! Therefore, we should not underestimate him. On the contrary, we should strive to ask this "?" Mr. and pursue exploration. (Reward for student loans)</p>
<h3>The Reason for Waking Up</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>In the early morning, there aren't many pedestrians on the street yet. Many children, in groups of three or five, are heading to school. Children, why do you get up so early? Your answer, of course, is because you don't want to be late for class. But let me ask another question: why do you wake up so early in the morning after going to sleep at night? Who wakes you up? I think the answers to this question will vary. Some will say their mother wakes them up, and others will say that no one wakes them up, and they wake up on their own. I think it's not quite right to say that you wake up on your own and no one wakes you up. However, I believe there will be quite a few children who will argue with me, saying that no one really wakes them up and they wake up on their own. Good children! Can you tell how many circles there are in the pattern on the right? Well, let me talk about the reason for waking up!</p>
<p>Why do we need to sleep? It's because we've worked all day, and all parts of our body are very tired. We need to give our body a sufficient rest and recovery, so we fall asleep. Children, do you feel this? If you are playing ball one day and you run excessively, you will feel particularly good sleep at night. This is because you need to recover your exhausted body. You sleep for a night, and your tired body has recovered. At this time, you should wake up. However, at this time, someone is waking you up. For example, the sunlight shines in from the window, making your body feel slightly different from the darkness—of course, you won't feel it if your fatigue hasn't recovered yet. Also, the chirping of small birds outside the window, the sound of your mother getting up early to tidy up everything in the house, and the cold and heat of the weather, as well as the thickness or thinness of the blankets on your body, all these are external things that prompt you to wake up when you have had enough sleep. So, these things are what wake you up in the morning.</p>
<p>Now that I've said this, children, you all understand that someone wakes you up in the morning.</p>
<h3>Pattern Riddle</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Children! Can you tell how many circles there are in the pattern on the right?</p>
<h3>Three Fables</h3>
<p>— Zhen Yun</p>
<p>(1) The Cat and the Rooster: A cat caught a rooster and wanted to find a reason to eat it. So it scolded the rooster, saying, "You bad thing, you crow loudly in the early morning, disturbing people's sweet dreams, so I will eat you today to eliminate harm for the people." The rooster defended itself, saying, "I work hard to crow in the early morning because I want to wake people up to work early!" But the cat's reply was, "Even if you have more and more substantial reasons, I still have to take you as a snack."</p>
<p>(2) The Fortune Teller: A fortune teller was sitting by the roadside telling fortunes when suddenly someone came urgently to report that the fortune teller's house had been robbed clean. The fortune teller sighed and hurried home. His neighbor said to him, "You fellow, you can predict people's good and bad fortunes, how come you couldn't foresee your own affairs?"</p>
<p>(3) Saving a Life: A child was walking on a bridge, lost his footing, and fell into the river. He was sinking little by little, almost drowning. Coincidentally, a man passed by, and the child asked the man for help. Unexpectedly, the man stood calmly on the bridge and scolded the child for being careless. The child shouted, "Sir, please save my life first, and then it will be okay for you to scold me."</p>
<h3>Several Seemingly True But Actually False Things</h3>
<p>— Jin Jian</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a Sunday when his father was home, Ah Hui had just finished dinner. His father was leisurely lying on the sofa resting, his mother was making shoes for his younger brother, his older brother was organizing his schoolbag, and his younger sister was sharpening pencils to prepare for homework. The entire room was shrouded in a quiet atmosphere. Suddenly, for some reason, he shattered this quiet air, pestering his father to tell him a story tonight no matter what. His father, who was sitting in deep thought, was really impatient with being disturbed and had to rack his brains to find material for a story, but the more he searched, the more he couldn't think of a single sentence. At this time, his father saw Ah Hui's younger sister sharpening a pencil, and the thought turned from the two words "pencil." In an instant, he took a turn in his mind and opened his mouth to ask Ah Hui: "What is a pencil made of?"</p>
<p>"Of course, a pencil is made of wood and a thin piece of lead combined together, otherwise why would it be called a pencil?" Ah Hui thought to himself, how could his father have become so stupid and actually ask such a childish question? However, he didn't know that he was revealing his own stupidity.</p>
<p>"That's right, I wanted you to answer like that, but you don't know that your answer is wrong. The lead in a pencil is made of lead, and not only is it easy to get wrong, but even ordinary people are also easily mistaken. The reason I'm asking you this question today is to hope that you correct this mistaken idea from now on. You should know that the lead in a pencil is not made of lead but of graphite. However, using graphite alone to make the lead in a pencil is too soft, so sometimes some clay or beeswax is added to the graphite to make it harder. The more clay is added, the harder the lead will be. Therefore, the letters "H" and "B" are engraved on each pencil shaft. The more "H" letters there are, the greater the hardness of the lead. The more "B" letters there are, the softer the lead. When the two letters "H" and "B" are together, the softness is moderate. We usually use "H" and "B." Fortunately, the lead in a pencil is made of graphite. Otherwise, some people who hold a pencil to write often lick the tip of the pencil on their tongue to make the writing darker. If the lead was made of lead, then there might be a strange story of someone dying from lead poisoning from the pencil. Because lead is indeed a very toxic substance, the pencil should be renamed a graphite pencil, which is much more appropriate, but it's not very convenient to say.</p>
<p>Suddenly thinking of fountain pens, this name is also not very appropriate. Some people mistakenly think that the ink stored in the pen is inexhaustible and will flow endlessly from a natural source. In fact, this is not the case. The ink in a pen also runs out one day and should be called an ink pen. Also, thinking of trains and cars, they are also mutually mistaken. In fact, trains use coal to boil the water in the boiler to turn it into steam, and then use the steam to push the wheels. It should be most appropriate to call it a steam car. In fact, cars do not use steam to make the car move, but when gasoline becomes a gas, the mixture of gas and air explodes due to the spark of electricity. The explosion expands and presses the piston of the wheel, which can make the car move. Therefore, the movement of a car relies entirely on the spark of electricity, so it should be called a fire car. Also, the tinplate used to make lead buckets is commonly called "foreign lead skin," but it is not made of lead at all and has absolutely no relation to lead. This is a piece of iron sheet, and to prevent it from rusting, a layer of zinc is applied to both sides, which is both beautiful and rust-proof. Therefore, the name "foreign lead skin" is a misnomer and should be called "zinc iron sheet" to be most accurate."</p>

<h3>The Women's Dramatic Arts Movement in "Free China"</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Awakening Public Awareness Achieves Great Results</p>
<p>In the "Free China" of the Great Rear Area, women are generally very enthusiastic about the dramatic arts movement. Everything is unknown to people in isolated islands. Therefore, the author wants to translate and report some of what a foreign newspaper reporter wrote for the readers of this magazine.</p>
<p>Women's Drama Troupes Generally, in "Free China," young women organize drama troupes and often set up stages near the market, improvising as needed. As long as there are spectators, they can immediately start performing dramas. Most of the plays performed are based on the heroic stories of Chinese soldiers fighting and other bad elements. Although most are short, they can also make the audience cheer, applaud, laugh, or cry. The depth of their touching power can be imagined. Sometimes these drama troupes follow the army and perform dramas to relieve the soldiers' loneliness. They have traveled far and wide from one village to another, from one province to another. One women's drama troupe once traveled five hundred miles in a year, performing the same play. Film star "China Garbo" Chen Boer left her film company after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai and joined the Northwest Drama Troupe, performing in the rear. Later, this drama troupe was captured by the Japanese army in Fengjing, Hebei Province, in April 1939, and no news has been heard since.</p>
<p>Women's Choir In addition to dramas, many women organized choir groups to sing in the rear. Using themes such as final victory, national unity, and beautiful rivers and mountains, they sang everywhere to awaken the awareness of the peasants. Sometimes when soldiers are digging trenches or building roads, they go to sing to uplift their spirits and speed up their work. At the same time, they go to comfort the soldiers who are departing for the front lines. Sometimes they go to the countryside to teach old women and children to sing, and their activities are also quite vigorous.</p>
<p>Women's Cartoon Book Group Generally, female painters organize groups and are busy drawing cartoons. Cartoons, like dramas and singing, encourage and stimulate the public. White paper, walls, and even mountain rocks have become places to draw cartoons. Many female painters often carry their drawing tools to various places to draw cartoons. In terms of themes, they also mostly adopt the heroic stories of soldiers on expeditions and the ugliness of bad elements. Therefore, eye-catching cartoons written by the hands of women are also visible everywhere in "Free China." Most of these women are graduates of art schools.</p>
<h3>"Hong Xuanjiao" to Be Brought to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>The historical drama "Hong Xuanjiao," which has been continuously performed by the China Travel Drama Troupe at the Lyceum and Cathay theaters, has been performed for a month since its premiere. Because the performance of the play is exceptionally good, it is deeply respected and loved by most audiences, and the sales have remained strong to this day. This has attracted the attention of the entertainment and film circles. Recently, the Living Beauty Film Company plans to bring the play to the silver screen. However, the result was that the actor problem was not resolved after consulting with the China Travel Drama Troupe, leading to widespread rumors that the production would be canceled. Recent news has come that Yan Heming and Wu Bangfan, the persons in charge of the Beauty Film Company, are unwilling to give up a good script. Therefore, they have recently held special negotiations with Tang Huaiqiu, the person in charge of the troupe. After some discussion, a satisfactory result has been achieved. It has been decided to bring the play to the silver screen. In addition to Tang Ruoqing continuing to play the leading role, all the supporting roles will also be played by the original cast of the China Travel Drama Troupe, and Fei Mu will still be the director.</p>
<p>The estimated production cost of the film is 75,000 yuan, and the actors' remuneration has also been decided to be 18,000 yuan. The remuneration for Tang Ruoqing and Tang Huaiqiu, father and daughter, has reached as much as 10,000 yuan. The remaining 8,000 yuan will be distributed among all the supporting roles, with each actor receiving 300 to 400 yuan. Therefore, the generosity of the remuneration is rare in the current domestic films. However, one of the points that the Beauty Book Company is most worried about is that the protagonist Tang Ruoqing's voice is very hoarse on the stage. If the voice on the silver screen is the same, it will inevitably affect the box office. Therefore, the company requires that the protagonist Tang Ruoqing should have a long period of rest before the film is produced. In addition, the person in charge of Beauty has stated that the company's production policy in the future will largely adopt excellent scripts from the stage as its basis. Therefore, the company is considering producing the play "Empress Dowager Cixi," which the China Travel Drama Troupe will perform next.</p>

<p>Yan Jupeng</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng is a typical figure of the "Old Tan School." His original name was Yan Xi, a member of the Mongolian ethnic group. His ancestor once served in Nanjing. Yan also wore clothes from the Ye Tribe in his hometown when he was young. Because he liked to be friends with people in the Pear Garden, he named himself Jupeng. During his amateur days, he was often known by those who knew music. Whenever there was a grand hall meeting, Jupeng would be invited as an amateur performer to perform at the same time as famous actors. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, he formally went professional. He first went south and joined the Gong Stage in Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession. The famous Qin player Chen Yanheng came with him, because half of Jupeng's plays were learned from Yanheng. His children all entered the Pear Garden. His eldest daughter, Huiying, married a well-known amateur player from the former capital, You. His second daughter, Huichen, studies Qingyi Huadan. His eldest son, Shaopeng, sings Laosheng. He does not follow the Tan School but instead raises the Ma School, which Jupeng does not approve of. (Huizhu and Shaopeng jointly filmed the film "The Second Mother Teaches Her Son"). His second son, Xiaopeng, plays Wusheng and studies art from Xiaolou. Now he and Jupeng are performing together at the Carlton Theatre. Since he came on stage, he has been praised unanimously, and the audience has been very large every day.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Ba</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth?</p>
<p>The old woman said to Liu Yinying, "Ying'er, please accompany Young Master Xu to the painting room to sit." Liu Yinying agreed and then gestured to Xu Jing to go to a room on the left to sit. The furnishings in the room were very elegant. There was a bookshelf full of books. On the left wall hung a portrait of Bodhidharma, the ancestor of Buddhism, and a precious sword, with a green sharkskin scabbard and apricot-yellow tassels. A desk was placed along the window. Liu Yinying and Xu Jing sat opposite each other. A young maid served fragrant tea. Liu Yinying then said to Xu Jing, "My uncle's surname is Zheng, his name is Anguo, and he is a well-read teacher who is proficient in the Book of Changes. He was initially in the Donglin Party and was framed by Wei Bannu, almost losing his life. Fortunately, he saw the opportunity and ran away, but all his family property in Tianjin and Baoding was confiscated by Wei. My uncle was discouraged by the affairs of the world, so he came to live in seclusion in this mountain, building a thatched hut and building this house himself, and opening up this courtyard. However, there are many wild animals in the mountains, which often harm people. Fortunately, my uncle also learned some boxing skills and has some self-defense skills, so he and my aunt and others live on this Phoenix Ridge, and they are safe and sound. I came here last mid-spring, just in time for my uncle to suffer from a serious illness, and the medicine was ineffective, and he passed away. When he was dying, he told me to accompany my aunt well and live here, not to go out, because he also knew that the world would soon be in great chaos, and the people of the Central Plains would suffer a great deal from war. I have been wandering around and wandering around, and I am a little tired, so I also live here to serve my aunt. In the same way, I am lonely in the mountains, and I often suffer from not having a matching partner, and my ambition has not been extinguished. I also want to do something for the country, quell the chaos, and live up to the meaning of my natural talent." As Liu Yinying said this, Xu Jing nodded repeatedly and said, "Heroes have the same views. I also want to establish some achievements in this chaotic world. Didn't the founding ancestor of our dynasty also rise up in time, and many talented people, like the wind and tiger and the cloud dragon, helped him lay the foundation for the world? We also need to save the people from water and fire and leave a good name in the bamboo and silk." Liu Xiong said that he was wandering around, and I have the same feeling. I wonder if Liu Xiong can tell me about it?" (66)</p>
